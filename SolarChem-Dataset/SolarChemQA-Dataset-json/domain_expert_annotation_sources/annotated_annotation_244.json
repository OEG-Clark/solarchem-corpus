The apparatus used for the photocatalytic experiments (Fig. S1, SuppoInfo), consisted of a three necked Pyrex batch photoreactor of cylindrical shape containing 50 ml of aqueous suspension at various pH.The photoreactor was provided with a jacket for cooling water circulation and ports in its upper section for the inlet and outlet of gases, for sampling and for pH and temperature measurements.A HRC UV-VIS lamp 300 W (Sanolux) and Xe-Halogen lamp 400 W (Radium) (the emission spectra are reported in Fig. S2 SuppoInfo) were placed in proximity (5-6 cm) of the reactor.CO 2 was bubbled into the suspensions for approximately 0.5 h before switching on the lamps to saturate the reaction mixture.The amount of catalyst used for the optimization of the reaction was between 50 and 300 mg.The amount of catalyst used to study of effect of the pH, the macrocycle, the metal and the quantity of sensitizers on the formation of formic acid was 50 mg.The initial pH, except in the basic (0.1 M NaOH) and neutral solution, was adjusted to 2.8 by addition of H 3 PO 4 .The temperature inside the reactor was held at approximately 300 K by a continuous circulation of water in the jacket around the photoreactor.The photoreactivity runs lasted 8.0 h and formic acid was detected by Ion Chromatography as reported in Fig S3 (SuppoInfo).", "vote": "1"}, {"llm generation": "water", "source": "In this work, we have shown that metal-free, Cu(II)-or Zn(II) tetrakis 4-(2,4-bis-(1,1-dimethylpropyl)phenoxy)phthalocyanines loaded over TiO 2 (anatase), already known for their high photocatalytic activity in the photodegradation of organic pollutants in water, catalyze as much efficiently the reduction of CO 2 to formic acid in water under UV-vis irradiation.", "context": "In this work, we have shown that metal-free, Cu(II)-or Zn(II) tetrakis 4-(2,4-bis-(1,1-dimethylpropyl)phenoxy)phthalocyanines loaded over TiO 2 (anatase), already known for their high photocatalytic activity in the photodegradation of organic pollutants in water, catalyze as much efficiently the reduction of CO 2 to formic acid in water under UV-vis irradiation.Cu(II)Pc/TiO 2 shows the best catalytic performance in terms of formic acid yields, surpassing in efficiency other similar catalytic systems. Additional benefits are the high stability of composites, the mild conditions under which reactions are run (room temperature, moderate acidic pH), and the avoidance of organic additives (e.g., radical scavengers) that are usually necessary to increase the catalytic efficiency 17. In view of their low environmental impact, low potential cost, and efficient power conversion, these multipurpose materials show promise in the search for sustainable methods for CO 2 valorization.It is obviously needed to widen the study to other different MPcs supported on TiO 2 for the sake of comparison and to try to clarify the mechanistic aspects in the light of these surprising experimental results.
