The crystalline structure and chemical functional group in the material were performed by employing a Rigaku Smartlab SE X-ray diffractometer (XRD) and a Bruker Vertx 70 Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) absorption spectrophotometer (FTIR).X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted by using Kratos Axis Ultra DLD with an Al Ka radiation to confirm the chemical constitution and valence state of the catalyst.The specific surface area and pore distribution were studied by N 2 adsorption/desorption isotherm recorded at 77 K by a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 apparatus.The morphology and microstructure were observed using a fieldemission scanning Hitachi S-4800 SU8220 Scanning electron microscope (SEM), JEM-2100 JEOL transmission electron microscope (TEM, 200 kV) and Bruker Multimode 8 Atomic force microscopy (AFM).Elementary analysis (EA) of C/N/H was conducted by Elementar Vario EL cube.UVevis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were measured by using a Hitachi F-4600 UVevis spectrometer spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 300e800 nm with a white standard of BaSO 4 as a reference.Photoluminescence (PL) mission spectra were collected from a Hitachi F-4600 fluorescence spectrometer with an excitation wavelength of 370 nm.Photoluminescence time-resolved anisotropy decays (PL-decay) were recorded on an Edinburgh PLS980 fluorescence spectrometer by utilizing time-correlated single-photon count.Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) data were recorded from a PHI 5000 VersaProbe III (Scanning ESCA Microprobe) SCA (Spherical Analyzer), using a He I (21.22 eV) as monochromatic discharge light source.A sample bias of A5 V was applied to investigate the secondary electron cutoff.The work function was determined by the difference between the photon energy (21.2 eV) and the binding energy of the secondary cutoff edge.The Pt concentration is investigated by using Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS, Agilent Technologies 8800, ICP-MS triple Quad).Contact angle measurements were performed by using Dataphysics OCA20. Solid electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy was conducted from a Bruker model A 300 spectrometer at room temperature with a settled microwave power of 19.1 dB and the microwave frequency of 10.1 GHz, and the analyzed samples were quantitative measured with 50 mg.Electron spin resonance (ESR) signals of the reactive hydroxyl radicals (OH) was examined by the probe molecule 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) at room temperature, equipped with a light source of 300 W Xe-lamp (l 420 nm).Electronic structure calculations of ordered and disordered repeated triazine units for the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels were evaluated by using the Gaussian program with B3LYP-D3BJ/6-31G (d) level of theory.The ordered structure corresponds to the planar structure, which is obtained without any geometry constraints, and the disordered structure was modelled by constraining the dihedral angles between adjacent aromatic rings to 90 . The femtosecond transient absorption (fs-TA) spectroscopy measurements were conducted by a Helios pump-probe system (Ultrafast Systems LLC) and equipped with an amplified femtosecond laser system (Coherent).The optical parametric amplifier with a 365 nm pump pulse (TOPAS-800-fs) was divided into multiple light beams.One was excited on a Ti: sapphire regenerative amplifier (Legend Elite-1K-HE; 800 nm, 35 fs, 7 mJ/pulse, 1 kHz), and the other was seeded by a mode-locked Ti: sapphire laser system (Micra 5), together with an Nd: YLF laser (EvolutIon 30) pumped.The temporal delay between them is dominated through a motorized optical delay stage.The pump and probe pulses overlapped spatially of the analyzed sample, and then the transmitted spectral profiles were gathered by using an optical fiber-coupled multichannel spectrometer and further proceeded by the Surface Xplorer software. Photoelectrochemical measurements were conducted on an electrochemical workstation (Chenhua CHI660E) using a standard three-electrode system with a working electrode, a Pt foil counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode.Working electrodes were prepared by dropping 100 mL of the resultant sample mixture slurry (5 mg of catalyst and 20 mL of Nafion solution in 1 mL ethanol solvent) onto the FTO glass electrode (1.0 A 2.0 cm 2 ) with 1 cm 2 active area, followed annealing at 150 C for 2 h.The photoelectrochemical measurements were performed with a 300 W Xe lamp light source and 0.2 M Na 2 SO 4 aqueous solution as the electrolyte solutions of which containing the buffer solution of 0.2 M NaH 2 PO 4 and Na 2 HPO 4 .The transient photocurrent responsive signals under cyclic chopped light and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were measured at a bias potential of A0.2 V.The Mott-Schottky plots were carried out by using three different frequency of the AC potential at 2000, 3000 and 4000 Hz to evaluate the flat potential.The donor carrier concentration could be calculated from the following equation (1) 38: where e signifies the elemental charge of 1.6 A 10 A19 C, A represents the active area of work electrode, 0 is the permittivity of vacuum of 8.85 A 10 A14 F/cm, is the relative permittivity which the value is 5.5 for PCN.The value of kT/e is generally ignored as it is too low. Photocatalytic hydrogen generation experiments were carried out in a 150 mL optical reaction vessel using a 300 W Xe-lamp (Beijing PerfectLight, Microsolar300) with a 420 nm cutoff filter as the light source and stirred at 5 C by flowing the cold water to control the temperature during the reaction.Typically, 30 mg of the photocatalyst was dispersed in 80 mL 5 M NaOH aqueous solution with 200 mg D-xylose or other kinds of lignocellulose, 0.8 wt Pt as the cocatalyst by a typical in-situ photo-deposition route from the precursor of H 2 PtCl 6 .Then the suspension in the reaction vessel was fixed, stirred, purged with Ar gas for 60 min to remove air, and irradiated by the Xe lamp with a 420 nm cutoff filter.The evolved H 2 gas was analyzed by gas chromatography (Shimadzu GC-2014) with a thermal conductive detector (TCD) and the argon as a carrier gas.Apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) for H 2 evolution was evaluated by applying the same closed reaction system under the illumination of a 300 W Xe lamp.Note that it is difficult to measure the absorption fraction of this kind of suspension mixture, so we give up to the apparent quantum efficiency to replace of the actual quantum efficiency which we ignored the light scattering by the catalyst particles suspended in a solution here 39,40. For measurement, the monochromatic light by using the bandpass filter with the precision of l 10 nm was employed, including the 385 nm, 420 nm, 450 nm, 485 nm, 535 nm, and 595 nm.The amount of H 2 evolution was collected after the light irradiation for 60 min.AQE under the different wavelengths irradiation was calculated based on the following equation ( 2) and ( 3): The number of H 2 molecules can be calculated from the generation rate of H 2 under 420 nm is 136.62 mmolh A1 .Thus, the received electron number of the products: 2 A 136.62 A 10 A6 / 3600 14 7.59 A 10 A8 mols A1 . According to hc/l, the energy of the single-photon at l 14 420 nm is calculated to be 4.736 A 10 A19 J, h and c are the Planck constant 6.63 A 10 A34 Js and the speed of light 3 A 10 8 m/s.Avogadro's number is 6.022 A 10 23 .The light intensity was measured to be 7.15 mW/cm 2 by calibrating with a light power meter.The radius of the illumination area of the reactor was 3.5 cm.Thus, the total incident photos number can be calculated to be 9.643 A 10 A7 mols A1 . Thus, the AQE 14 7.59 A 10 A8 mols A1 / 9.643 A 10 A7 mols A1 A 100 14 7.87 The reaction system is the same as above mentioned instrument.Typically, 30 mg of each catalyst was dispersed in 80 mL of an aqueous solution containing 8 mL of triethanolamine (TEOA), used as a sacrificial agent and 0.2 wt of Pt as the reductive cocatalyst prepared by a typical in-situ photo-deposition route from the precursor of H 2 PtCl 6 .Then the reacting solution was irradiated by the Xe lamp (l 420 nm) and the generated H 2 gas was analyzed by gas chromatography with a TCD detector. The reaction system is the same as above mentioned instrument.Typically, 30 mg catalyst, 1 mmol CoCl 2 , and 15 mg 2,2bipyridine was added in 5 mL 10 TOA/acetonitrile solution with 0.5 mL H 2 O.The reactor was degassed three times for 60 min to remove air and filled into the high pure CO 2 gas (99.999).The gaseous products (CO, CH 4 ) were investigated by an FID detector equipped with a mechanized by gas chromatography and the generation of H 2 was simultaneously detected by the TCD detector."}, {"title": "Results_and_discussion", "content": "The in-plane polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) based p-conjugated heterostructure was synthesized by using a hydrothermal pretreatment and then a thermal polymerization process as depicted schematically in Fig. 2a.We use dicyandiamide as the precursor, the appropriate concentration of N-acetylethanolamine (NEA) was added in the dicyandiamide aqueous solution, of which serving as a base catalyst and strapping the released bronsted acid from the precursor under the polymerization process (the schematic diagram showing in Supplementary Material Fig. S1).It might also undergo an in-situ CeN bonding to form an amide heterocycle motifs along the edge of a generated supermolecular melaminecyanaurate complex intermediate during the hydrothermal process 41.These may enable rapid nucleation of the intermediate to partially formed a condensation domain 42, further hydrolysis into the target holey carbon nitride with the in-plane p-conjugated heterostructure, denoted as HCN-NEA.We also synthesized a series of control samples, such as bulk carbon nitride (BCN), holey PCN (HCN) and NEA-modified bulk PCN (BCN-NEA).The morphology of HCN-NEA sample was characterized by scanning, transmission electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy (SEM, TEM, and AFM) images.As shown in Fig. 2b, porous thin nanosheets with a approximately uniform size in SEM image were observed for HCN-NEA samples.However, both BCN and BCN-NEA show an irregular bulked particle in the SEM images (Fig. S2).While HCN possesses a porous layered structure but with a packed entity (SEM) (Fig. S3), indicating the hydrothermal process contributes towards the formation of the porous and reduced layer structure.The existence of NEA could tune the size and morphology of the generated nanosheets, this is verified by the formation of the curly-like architecture in HCN-NEA with a curved and condensed edge from the careful observation of Fig. 2c, in comparison to the aggregated and smooth layer structure in HCN 43.The TEM image in Fig. 2de also shows a curly-like morphology in HCN-NEA with a bright black curved edge with an almost uniform width of 28 nm, this curved edge may have a higher crystalline and condensed domain when compared to the amorphous structure of the inner part of the curlylike nanosheets of which renders a semitransparent slice. This could be corroborated by the high-resolution TEM image (Fig. 2f) and the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) image (Fig. 2g) of this curved edge domain.Unambiguously, the distinctly ordered lattice fringe on the periphery domain was observed in HCN-NA and possessed a lattice spacing of 0.32 nm indexed to the (002) crystal plane of PCN 44.And two bright diffraction rings in the SAED image of HCN-NEA confirm the certain degree of the high crystalline configuration to some extent.Moreover, the lattice fringes in Fig. 2f surrounded by the amorphous matrix, these structure features a surface dyadic heterostructure containing the in-plane disordered and ordered domain with different electron affinity which would trigger the formation of the local p-conjugated electronic field (i.e.built-in type-II heterojunction) at the interface of heterostructure of HCN-NEA 45e47, i.e. the photoinduced electron prone to inject into the ordered chains of the edge of the curly-like nanosheets due to the rapid migration rate, leaving the hole stay in disordered domain 48,49.As such, this surface dyadic heterostructure could synchronously lead to an efficient carrier transfer and charge separation at the interface.And the formation of this p-conjugated heterojunction could change the electronic structure including a lowering of highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level, disrupt the long-range repeated atomic order, accompany provide new chemically active sites for the photoredox reaction 49e51.There were verified by the density functional theory (DFT) simulations in Fig. 3 that the ordered heptazine chain possesses both the lowered LUMO and HOMO energy level (i.e.A2.07 eV and A6.18 eV, respectively) than the disordered heptazine chain (i.e.A2.07 eV and A6.18 eV, respectively), accompanying the redistributed localized states in ordered heptazine chain.As illustrated in the AFM image (Fig. 2h), HCN-NEA comprises a typical two-dimension nanosheets and has a layer thickness of about 2.30 nm.Collectively, these results evidently manifest the successful formation of in-plane PCN surface dyadic heterostructure with the high crystalline domain along the curved edge of curly-like nanosheets by using an organic amine base NEA to modulate the fabrication process. The generated porous structure was further analyzed by using the N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms, shown in Fig. 4a.As expected, HCN-NEA exhibits an enhanced BrunauereEmmetteTeller (BET) specific surface area of 74.4 m 2 g -1 , apparently higher than BCN (6.8 m 2 g -1 ) and BCN-NEA (19.3 m 2 g -1 ).A sharp mesopore distribution peak at about 2.5 nm and a broad trail extended to 30 nm region with a pore volume of 0.256 cm 3 /g, also larger than BCN (0.011 m 2 g -1 ) and BCN-NEA (0.086 m 2 g -1 ), suggesting a mesoporous characteristic of HCN-NEA with a relatively uniform pore distribution consistent with the above-mentioned SEM results.The specific surface area and pore volume of HCN (73.2 m 2 g -1 , 0.217 cm 3 /g) is smaller than HCN-NEA, signifying the addition of NEA slightly enlarges the specific surface area and pore volume, counteracting accompany the partial formation of a well-ordered condensed domain.The chemical structure of the HCN-NEA and the related samples were first characterized by using X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy.The XRD pattern of pristine BCN exhibits two typical pattern peaks located at 12.82 and 27.82 (Fig. 4b), ascribed to the (100) interplanar of repeated tri-s-triazine units packing peak and the (002) interlayer stacking of conjugated aromatic segments peak, respectively 52.The lowered and broadened (002) peak of the HCN-NEA shifts slightly towards a lower 2q angle (Fig. 4c), suggesting a larger stacking distance of the interplanar which may be originated from uniformly distribute mesopores network resulting in the increased space distance to expand the stereoscopic space 41.The (100) peak shifts to a lower diffraction angle of 12.67 compared with 12.82 for BCN (Fig. 4d), revealing the extended interplanar packing distance due to the formation of inplane surface dyadic heterostructure resulting in a the slight distortion of the nitride pots (i.e. three sp 2 hybridized CeN formed tri-s-triazine motifs make a ring to form a center) 53. The FTIR spectrum for the pristine BCN exhibits a peak at 807 cm A1 , representing the out-of-plane bending mode of characteristic tri-s-triazine motifs (Fig. 5a).Several peaks located between 1200 and 1800 cm A1 are referred to as the NeCN heterocyclic ring and the broad bands in 3000e3500 cm A1 region correspond to the amino group and dangling OeH stretching vibrations 54.The modulated HCN-NEA sample possesses a similar FTIR peaks, demonstrating the backbone structure of PCN is well maintained after the addition of NEA.However, the characteristic peak of tri-striazine motifs in HCN-NEA is obviously weaker than BCN and shifts to the higher wavenumber of 812 cm A1 (Fig. S4), indicating a higher binding energy and the disturbance of the packing structure as the formation of in-plane surface dyadic heterostructure which then proceeds the enhancement of electronegative and the binding energy 55.Contact angle measurement of water on BCN and HCN-NEA were analyzed, both of the surface of these two sample are hydrophilicity (Fig. S5), but HCN-NEA possesses a slightly larger contact angle. To further gain insight into the effect of NEA addition on the chemical composition and bonding features, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out.The XPS survey spectrum (Fig. 5b) confirms all the samples composed of three elements of C, N, O.The deconvolution of XPS C1s spectrum in BCN has two conspicuous peaks centered at 248.1 and 284.8 eV, ascribed to sp 2 -hybridized carbon CeNC and CeC (adventitious hydrocarbons), respectively (Fig. 5c) 28.And for the high N 1s spectrum, three peaks can be deconvoluted and located at 398.4 eV for CeN C (sp 2 -hybridized nitrogen), 398.9 eV for N-(C) 3 (bridging pyrrolic N) and 400.5 eV for the amino group in the edge of tri-s-triazine motifs (Fig. 5d) 9.Notably, compared to BCN, the sp 2 -hybridized carbon CeNC signal of HCN-NEA shifts to the higher binding energy (i.e. from 288.1 to 288.3 eV), reflecting that the alteration of surrounding chemical states of carbon atoms.Considering CeNC signal in BCN-NEA also shows a shift to the higher binding energy and HCN sample almost keeps the same value with BCN, implying it is originated from the NEA addition which undergoes the outward curling of repeated tri-s-triazine units as the presence of in-plane surface dyadic heterostructure, consistent with the FTIR results 51,56.Consequently, all of the three XPS N 1s in HCN-NEA exhibits a shift to higher binding energy, strongly evidences the successful formation of the in-plane surface dyadic heterostructure. The formation of in-plane surface dyadic heterostructure will dramatically alter the electronic bandgap structure and the optical property.Therefore, the optical absorption properties of the PCN products were recorded by UVevis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) and the corresponding bandgaps were also acquired by using the Kubelk-Munk method, shown in Fig. 6a.Firstly, HCN-NEA shows a blue-shift of the intrinsic steep absorption band edge in comparison to BCN, due to the quantum confinement induced by the enhanced specific surface area and ultrathin curly-like nanosheets 53.And intriguingly, the extended and reinforced visible absorption region at 450e700 nm are also observed, arising primarily from the enhanced density and redistribution of band tails/ localized states owing to the presence of the built-in type-II heterojunction and secondary destruction of the long-range order of the repeated tri-s-triazine structure by the highly ordered domain in the configuration 49.Moreover, the bandgaps of HCN-NEA and BCN acquired from the Kubelk-Munk method are 2.69 eV and 2.72 eV (Fig. S6), respectively. In order to determine the alteration of electronic band structure, the MotteSchottky (M A S) plots and ultraviolet photoelectron spectra (UPS) of HCN-NEA and BCN were measured.The positive slope of the M A S plots for both HCN-NEA and BCN signify their ntype semiconductor characteristic (Fig. 6b) 48, three frequencies 2K, 3K, and 4K Hz were selected for the M A S plots based on the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements (EIS, Fig. S7).The flat band potential (E fb ) of HCN-NEA semiconductor electrode calculated from the intercept of the axis by the three different M A S plots are measured to be A1.06 V vs Ag/AgCl (i.e., A0.86 V vs NHE), clearly lower than the A1.55 V of BCN due to the formation of built-in type-II heterojunction, signifying a reduced distance for transportation of the excited electron from valence band to conduction band, thus in favorable of efficient charge separation.For many n-type semiconductors, E fb is routinely considered to be about 0.2V below the conduction band (E cb ) 57.Based on this, the estimated E cb value of HCN-NEA is A1.06 V vs NHE at pH 14 7.Although the E cb of HCN-NEA is lower than BCN, the photogenerated electrons still have sufficient energy to reduce the proton to hydrogen or reduce CO 2 to CO.Moreover, HCN-NEA has a smaller slope of 8.29 A 10 9 than that of the 1.79 A 10 10 in BCN, based on the M A S plot of the frequency of 3K Hz.Consequently, by using the M A S plots, the donating electron density N d of HCN-NEA is calculated to 3.10 A 10 21 cm A3 , larger than the 1.43 A 10 21 cm A3 of BCN, obviously demonstrating HCN-NEA possesses an increased charge carriers concentration and thus facilitate the photocatalytic reduction reaction. Moreover, UPS spectra (Fig. 6c) reveal the work function of HCN-NEA is elevated to 4.90 eV (21.2e16.3eV), 0.3 eV higher than that of the pristine BCN and close to the value of good electron conductor graphite (5 eV).Thus benefitting from the improved carriers density and the higher work function, the HCN-NEA could enable the fast transfer of the photoinduced electrons and retard the recombination of electron-hole pairs than BCN 49.The valence band position (VB) of HCN-NEA was estimated to be A6.10 eV (vs vacuum), larger than BeCN (A5.58 eV, calculated by its work function 4.6 eV plus 0.98 eV from the linear intersection).Correspondingly, the VB position of MCNM and BeCN is 1.66 (6.1e4.44 eV) and 1.14 eV vs NHE (5.58e4.44 eV), respectively, based on the correlation between the vacuum energy (E vac ) and the normal electrode potential (E NHE ), i.e.E NHE 14 AE vac A4.44 58.This implies HCN-NEA has an obviously strengthened oxidation ability for the decomposing of lignocellulose.Correspondingly, the differences in electronic energy band positions between HCN-NEA and BCN can be clarified and illustrated in Fig. 6d. By virtue of the intriguing porous curly-like architecture and surface dyadic heterostructure which then leads to the enhanced visible absorption region, reduced transfer distance, higher work function, efficient charge-carrier separation behavior, as well as a stronger oxidation ability, HCN-NEA is expected to be an efficient catalyst for the electron-involved photocatalytic proton reduction process.The photocatalysts were first evaluated the hydrogen evolution performance by using of D-xylose as the sacrificial agent to trap excited hole (i.e. one of a representative hemicellulose) in aqueous solution, illuminated by a 300 Xe lamp with a 420 nm filter and 0.8 wt Pt as cocatalysts via an in-situ photo deposited process from the precursor of H 2 PtCl 6 .The typical time course of H 2 evolution rate (HER) over the resultant samples was shown in Fig. 7a.The pristine BCN just shows the low photocatalytic activity of 7.87 mmolh A1 , both HCN and BCN-NEA have a clearly enhanced HER rate of 37.08 and 40.15 mmolh A1 , respectively.And HCN-NEA possesses the highest HER value of 122.77 mmolh A1 (i.e.4092 mmolh A1 g A1 ), 15.6 times higher than that of BCN, contributing to the coexistence of both the formation of porous curly-like ultrathin nanosheets by endured the hydrothermal pretreatment process and the surface dyadic heterostructure formed as the existence of the ordered and disordered configuration as the NEA addition.And the total H 2 production in this experiment reached 122.77 mmol per hour, corresponding to an overall turnover frequency (TOF) of 99.8 h A1 per added Pt atom.The absence of xylose is incapable of generating H 2 in this system and the alkaline condition is necessary to give a higher solubility of xylose for the easy accessibility to the heterogeneous reaction.Meanwhile, it is necessary to note that the photocatalytic oxidation of xylose could trigger the generation of some certain amount of formate products, analyzed by using a highperformance liquid chromatography (HPLC, Agilent 1260 series with a UV detector at 210 nm and a Bio-Rad Aminex HPX-87H column) with the residual liquid after illumination, which is also a product of biomass oxidation by thermally driven metal oxide catalysts or light-driven sulfide catalyst 19,59,60.To some extent, this system enables the simultaneous oxidation of xylose to valuable organic products and the reduction of water in H 2 gas under the visible light illumination.Considering the low efficiency of overall water splitting and difficult for the separation of generated H 2 and O 2 , this lignocellulose-based heterogeneous photoreforming system seems to be more attractive 13,61. An apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 7.87 was achieved when irradiated with 420 nm monochromatic light (Fig. 7b), which is comparable to recently reported efficiencies of Pt/TiO 2 or CdS/ CdO x for the small saccharide-reforming reaction under ultraviolet light or visible light 4,19.Significantly, considering the extended visible light absorption region, when the incident monochromatic light is extended to 595 nm, a certain detectable amount of H 2 can still be generated over HCN-NEA.However, in sharp contrast to HCN-NEA, BCN just shows the H 2 evolved activity under the stimulation of 420 nm and 465 nm monochromatic light, no H 2 product is released when exceeding the optical region of 500 nm.These results unambiguously demonstrate HCN-NEA has a very broad optical response activity over the most part of the visible light spectrum and it also corroborates that the substantially extended visible light absorption region is also responsible for the increased HER of HCN-NEA.The different HER value with the addition of NEA (Fig. 7c) suggests that HCN-NEA and BCN-NEA synthesized by the addition of 0.3 mL/6 g (precursor) exhibits the highest HER value.The versatility of the system was investigated by suspending one kind of monosaccharides (e.g.glucose) in above mentioned same conditions.As shown in Fig. 7d, HCN-NEA still possesses the highest HER of 167.4 mmolh A1 (i.e.5580.8 mmolh A1 g A1 ), 14.2 folds that of BCN (11.8 mmolh A1 ).The heightened specific H 2 evolution by using glucose than xylose is due to the higher solubility of glucose, which possesses more accessible oxidation sites for the heterogeneous HCN-NEA photocatalyst (Fig. S8).Photocatalytic lignocellulose reformation into H 2 was then expanded to several other cellulose and hemicellulose derivatives as well as some most common units found from their structures (Fig. 7e).In the presence of fructose, 14.32 mmolh A1 of H 2 was generated, but much lower than the use of glucose.Using a-cellulose and cellobiose would generate 30.2 and 75.6 mmolh A1 of H 2 , respectively.And photoreforming of arabinose, xylan and galactose enable the HER of 21.4, 35.1 and 156.3 mmolh A1 , respectively.The results demonstrate the versatility of this HCN-NEA based system for photoreforming lignocellulose, while the difference of HER value in the presence of different lignocellulosic components may be limited by the accessibility to trap the photoinduced holes in HCN-NEA 62.The photocatalytic stability in the presence of xylose was conducted for four cycles, as shown in Fig. 7f.After four cycles of tests, the hydrogen evolution rate was slightly lower than the fresh one, demonstrating a relatively good activity stability.The chemical and morphology stability of HCN-NEA after reaction was conducted by using the XRD spectra and TEM image (Fig. S9S10), the similar spectrum between the fresh sample before the reaction with the recovered one indicates the well maintained characteristic structure of the PCN.The lixiviation of Pt after each cycle experiments were also investigated by using ICP-MS, almost no Pt is released after every cycle, suggesting the Pt strongly anchored in HCN-NEA. The hydrogen evolution rate was substantially enhanced using HCN-NEA when photoreforming triethanolamine (TEOA) and 0.2 wt of Pt as the reductive cocatalyst which manifests a marvelous H 2 evolution rate of 661.3 mmolh A1 (i.e.22043 mmolh A1 g A1 ), 56.0 folds than pristine BCN (11.8 mmolh A1 ) and together with an superior high AQE of 41.2 at the irradiation light of 420 nm (Fig. 8ab), surpassing most of the state-of-art PCNbased heterogeneous photocatalysts for H 2 evolution by using these reaction system (showing in Table S2) 63.And the variation in AQE of HCN-NEA with the monochromatic irradiation light wavelength is nearly consistent with its absorption spectrum, exhibiting a similar tendency with the above-mentioned results.We then further performed visible-light-induced CO 2 conversion reaction, due to the reduction of CO 2 is more challenging as the dissociation enthalpy of OCO double bond of is as high as 765 kJ mol A1 , in comparison to the 237 kJ mol A1 of the dissociation enthalpy HeOeH in H 2 O molecule when performing the watersplitting reaction 64,65.Two kinds of product gas (i.e.H 2 and CO) can be detected, HCN-NEA III shows a CO reduction rate of 56.3 mmolh A1 , 24.5 times than BCN (2.3 mmolh A1 ) together with a 95.3 selectivity (Fig. 8c).No obvious deactivation of CO/H 2 evolution was observed after five cycles, confirming the good activity stability for CO 2 reduction (Fig. 8d). To understand the origin of the prominent photocatalytic performance, several spectroscopic and photoelectrochemical measurements were conducted.The photoluminescence (PL) emission spectrum was first carried out to evaluate the separation efficiency of photoinduced electron-hole pairs in the semiconductor photocatalyst.As shown in Fig. 9a, HCN-NEA exhibits a strong emission peak at 466 nm, demonstrating a strong exciton resonance mainly arising from the photoinduced electron-hole plasma of delocalized p-n radiative transition (i.e.severe recombination of charge recombination) 66,67.The blue-shift of emission peak at 452 nm in HCN ascribed to the quantum confinement effect.The intensity of the fluorescence signal of BCN-NEA and HCN-NEA samples is remarkably decreased and HCN-NEA possesses the lowest intensity of PL emission peak, confirming the presence of NEA additive during the synthesis process makes a primary contribution to the separation and the relaxation of excited exciton down to the ground state.The newly generated emission peaks near 480e500 nm and 550e570 nm for HCN-NEA and BCN-NEA samples suggest higher subband radiative transitions, in accord with the above mentioned DRS results. To further investigate the charge carriers separation behaviors, the femtosecond transient absorption (fs-TA) spectroscopy was investigated.The positive signals in TA carrier dynamics spectra of HCN-NEA and BCN probed at 590 nm represent electron in excited states, and the dynamics signals were bi-exponentially fitted and two distinct decay components with lifetime parameters can be achieved in Fig. 9b 68.HCN-NEA has both increased short and long-lived lifetime than pristine BCN (t 1 from 1.9 to 11.6 ps; t 2 from 161.6 to 564.8 ps).The rapid signal rising process (t 1 ) is assigned to the interband transportation of photoinduced carriers to the emission state, and the subsequent slow decay component reflects the charge separation process promoted by band-to-band.The longer lifetime in HCN-NEA presumably due to the consequence of formation of charge-separated states with photoexcited electrons injecting in the crystalline ordered chain and holes in the amorphous domain originating from the formation of surface dyadic heterostructure and simultaneous the improved charge carriers density caused by the highly ordered domain induced destruction of the long-range order 69.In line with this, HCN-NEA also has a prolonged fluorescent lifetime of 10.67 ns than that of the 3.67 ns in BCN from the time-resolved transient photoluminescence (PL) spectra in Fig. 9c.The longer lifetime of HCN-NEA relative to BCN may also be assigned to porous curly-like ultrathin nanosheets which trigger the charge carriers rapid transfer from the photocatalyst' interior to the surface.This notably allows an efficient charge separation and thus provides sufficiently excited surface electrons to participate in the photocatalytic reaction, thus eventually imparting the desired reaction activity. The redistribution of band tails/localized states and enhanced carriers density for HCN-NEA was studied by using solid-state electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) characterizations (Fig. 9d).A signal single Lorentzian symmetry curves centering at g 14 2.023 is observed for HCN-NEA and BCN either under the dark or with light irradiation, indicating the generation of unpaired electrons of the tri-s-triazine repeated rings.The EPR intensity of HCN-NEA is much more intense than that of pristine BCN in the dark, confirming the raising of delocalization of the electrons and optimizes the surface heterostructure for charge separation for HCN-NEA 70.Transient photocurrent has been further employed to confirm the above result, the promoted photocurrent response is recognized in HCN-NEA and is reproducible during the chopped ON/OFF illumination cycles (Fig. 10a).Collectively, the substantial Moreover, when refers to the photocatalytic lignocellulose oxidation process, it is often believed the formation of hydroxyl radicals (OH) is the prerequisite to subsequently oxidize the lignocellulose substrate (e.g.CeC cleavage of ring-opening) 37,71,72.Therefore, aiming at illustrating the advance of HCN-NEA using for lignocellulose reforming with high activity, the electron spin response (ESR) trap technique by using 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) as the hydroxyl radical trapper was carried out, shown in Fig. 10b.Four ESR peaks with a characteristic relative intensity of 1:2:2:1 are recognized by using HCN-NEA under visible light irradiation assigned to the DMPO/OH adduct, verifying the existence of OH species in the photocatalytic lignocellulose oxidation and there is no signal in the dark.HCN-NEA possesses a remarkably high intense ESR signal of DMPO/OH, demonstrating the higher concentration of OH radicals could participate in the oxidation process to facilitate the reaction.This is ascribed to larger valence band potential in HCN-NEA (i.e.1.66 eV compared to the 1.14 eV in BCN) for a stronger oxidation ability and the efficient charge separation that renders more exciting holes to survive in the material surface to react with surface-bound OH A generate OH radical.As such, the lignocellulose substrate can be oxidized by the strong oxidizer and allows the CeC bond cleavage to generate formate.It need to note that although the valence band position in HCN-NEA is not favor of directly generating the OH radical (1.96 V, pH 14 7), the indirectly transformation route may be involved in this material, more works are required in the further. In short, the experimental characterization and DFT simulation results can be well interpreted by the formation of surface dyadic heterostructure (i.e. the high crystalline ordered chain and the amorphous disordered domain in HCN-NEA) by NEA addition resulting in the emerged of built-in type-II heterojunction and the simultaneously disruption of their long-range repeated atomic order as well as the accompanied curly-like ultrathin lamellar framework with abundant mesopores aroused by the hydrothermal pretreatment process.The introduction of surface dyadic heterostructure of HCN-NEA accompanied by destruction of the longrange order of the repeated tri-s-triazine structure increases the charge density and redistribution of band tails/localized states which is responsible for the alteration of electronic band structure and the distinctly extended strong optical absorption region.On the basis of the aforementioned experimental and DFT analysis, the introduction of surface dyadic heterostructure into the porous PCN nanostructure can substantially improve the photocatalytic activity.We therefore propose the following mechanism (Fig. 11): i) the redistribution of band tails/localized states leads to substantially extended visible light absorption region which results in a more efficient of the utilization of incident light source.ii) this formed surface dyadic heterostructure could largely retard the radiative recombination of the photoinduced electron-hole pairs, facilitate the charge transfer accompanied by the enhancement of the charge carriers density to the material surface; iii) the longer carriers lifetime and higher work function in HCN-NEA than that of BCN is capable of improving the electron transfer mobility; iv) the curlylike porous configuration facilitates the rapid transfer of excited carriers, reactants as well as products; v) specifically, the enlarged valence band position leads to a stronger oxidation ability accompanied with a generation of OH radical is favorable of the lignocellulose reforming."}, {"title": "Conclusions", "content": "In summary, we have reported a charge transfer steering through optimizing the nucleation process strategy by using an organic amine base (NEA) modulating thin porous PCN nanostructure to improve visible-light photocatalytic activity.Benefiting from the formation of surface dyadic heterostructure and curly-like porous configuration, HCN-NEA possesses the strong visible lightharvesting ability, efficient separation of charge carriers, abundant in-plane holes in nanosheets as well as the enhanced oxidation ability.Thus, the hydrogen evolution rate of HCN-NEA by in the presence of xylose under visible light achieves 122.77 mmolh A1 (i.e. 4092mmolh A1 g A1 ) with an apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 7.87 (l 14 420 nm), 15.6 times higher than that of BCN.And HCN-NEA has the H 2 evolution rate of 661.3 mmolh A1 (i.e.22043 mmolh A1 g A1 ), 56.0 folds than pristine BCN (11.8 mmolh A1 ) and together with an superior AQE of 41.2 (l 14 420 nm) by using triethanolamine as sacrificial agent, as well as a high CO reduction rate of 56.3 mmolh A1 from the CO 2 conversion, 24.5 times than BCN.This well demonstrates the advantage of surface dyadic heterostructure and thin porous nanostructure in optimizing the photocatalytic activity of the PCN photocatalyst.Our findings signify the great potential application in the fields of heterogeneous organic transformation, environmental remediation, and energy conversion and also provide a feasible strategy for steering the charge transfer and simultaneously realize the wide spectrum visible-light Fig. 1.Schematic for photoinduced carrier transfer behaviors of (a) BCN and (b) HCN-NEA.(A colour version of this figure can be viewed online.)
