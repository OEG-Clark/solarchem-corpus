Defective Bi 2 Ti 2 O 7 /TiO 2 composites were synthesized by in situ thermal reduction with subsequent topochemical reaction etching.Briefly, 0.2 g of BTO was placed on a ceramic wafer, which was then placed in a quartz tube furnace.The samples were heated at different temperatures for 4 h at a temperature-programmed rate of 5 C/min in an atmosphere of flowing H 2 /Ar (5 H 2 ).The obtained samples, denoted as HBTO, were added to HNO 3 (2 mol/L) with constant stirring at room temperature for 2 h.The product was then centrifuged, washed with deionized water repeatedly, and dried in an oven at 60 C for 4 h.The resulting products were denoted as BTO/TiO 2 -X (X 400, 450, 500, and 550 C).Pristine and defective TiO 2 (H-TiO 2 ) samples were also prepared for comparison.Pristine TiO 2 was synthesized following the same procedure used to obtain BTO but without the addition of Bi(NO 3 ) 3 5H 2 O, and H-TiO 2 was obtained from pristine TiO 2 in the same way as HBTO. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed using a D8 diffractometer (Bruker, Germany) with Cu Ka radiation.Thermogravimetric analysis-differential scanning calorimetry (TGA-DSC) was performed using a TGA/DSC3 analyzer (Mettler Toledo, LLC, USA).Scanning electron microscopy micrographs were obtained using a JSM-7610F Plus scanning electron microscope (JEOL, Ltd., Japan).Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained, and a corresponding elemental mapping analysis was performed on a Talos F200S (FEI, USA) high-resolution transmission electron microscope.The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area and porosity were obtained using a Tristar II 3020 apparatus (Micromeritics Instrument Corporation, USA).UV A Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV A Vis DRS) was performed using an Evolution 220 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher, USA).The band gap energy (Eg) was calculated based on these spectra.The surface photovoltage (SPV) was investigated using a surface photovoltaic test system consisting of a 300 W xenon lamp source with a monochromator and a lock-in amplifier.Photoluminescence spectra (PL) were obtained using a Fluorescence Spectrophotometer F-7000 (Hitachi, Japan).X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and VB spectroscopy were performed using a 1600 ESCA XPS instrument (ULVAC-PHI, Japan).The low-temperature electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements were recorded using an EPR ELEXSYS 500 spectrometer (Bruker, Germany).The in-situ Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopies were performed on an INVENIO FT-IR spectrometer (Bruker, Germany). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and photocurrent and Mott-Schottky curve measurements were performed using a CHI660E electrochemical workstation (Shanghai Chenhua Science Technology Corp., Ltd., China) with a three-electrode system and a Na 2 SO 4 solution (0.5 M) as the electrolyte.A Pt wire was used as the counter electrode, an Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) was used as the reference electrode, and samples coated with Fdoped SnO 2 -coated glass (FTO) were used as working electrodes.The working electrodes were prepared via a dip-coating process. Briefly, 8 mg of a sample was ground and dispersed in 1000 lL of a mixed solution (720 lL of deionized water, 240 lL of ethanol, and 40 lL of naphthol).The suspending liquid was sonicated to make a slurry and then added dropwise to FTO with an exposed area of 1 cm 2 .The working electrode was then dried in an oven at 100 C for 2 h.In the photocurrent test, a 300 W xenon lamp was used as the light source at illumination intervals of 30 s. The terephthalic acid (TA) fluorescence method was employed to detect the formation of hydroxyl radicals.Briefly, TA was dissolved in a NaOH solution to form a mixed solution with a TA concentration of 0.5 mmolAL A1 and a NaOH concentration of 2 mmolAL A1 33,34.Then, 0.1 g of the photocatalyst was dispersed in 100 mL of the solution and irradiated using a 300 W xenon lamp for 100 min.Amounts of 5 mL of the suspension were sampled every 20 min.The fluorescence spectra of the centrifuged solution were measured using a Fluorescence Spectrophotometer F-7000 (Hitachi) at an excitation wavelength of 315 nm. The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance of the prepared samples was evaluated in a gas-solid system with a top irradiation stainless-steel reactor.A 300 W xenon lamp (HSX-F300; Beijing NBET Technology Co., Ltd., China) was used as the light source for solar simulation.Before the photocatalytic reaction, 50 mg of the sample was ultrasonically dispersed in 5 mL of deionized water and poured into an open quartz container.The container was dried in an oven at 60 C and then treated in a vacuum oven at 150 C to desorb the carbonaceous compounds adsorbed on the catalyst.Then, the container coated with the photocatalyst was placed in the reactor, and 2.5 mL of deionized water was injected.After it was vacuum-treated, CO 2 gas was injected into the reactor.The pressure in the reactor was 1 atm.In the photocatalytic reaction, the xenon lamp was turned on to irradiate on top of the reactor.The temperature in the reactor was maintained at 20 C using a cryogenic thermostat.After that, 1 mL of the gas in the reactor was collected and analyzed using an HF-901A gas chromatographer (Beijing Zhongkehuifen Analytical Instrument Co., Ltd., China) every hour.The quantities of CO and CH 4 were calculated using standard curves.In order to evaluate the recyclability of the sample, the recycling experiment was carried out under the same conditions.Before each run, the photocatalyst was dried in an oven at 60 C and then treated in a vacuum oven at 150 C to desorb the carbonaceous compounds adsorbed on the catalyst. First-principles calculations were performed according to density functional theory (DFT) using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) 35.Projector augmented-wave pseudopotential was used to calculate ion-electron interactions 36.The correlation and exchange terms were described using general gradient approximation in the scheme of the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerh of functional 37.For the calculation of charge density differences, a slab model consisting of anatase TiO 2 with a (1 0 1) plane and Bi 2 -Ti 2 O 7 with a (1 1 0) plane was established to represent the contact surface between TiO 2 and Bi 2 Ti 2 O 7 .The primitive cells of both TiO 2 and Bi 2 Ti 2 O 7 were geometry optimized before the construction of the TiO 2 /Bi 2 Ti 2 O 7 heterostructure.To eliminate interactions between the two components, vacuum separation larger than 15 A was employed.The first Brillouin zone was sampled with a 1 A 1 A 1 k-point mesh.A kinetic energy cutoff of 500 eV was used in all calculations.The convergence criteria for energy and force were 10 A5 eV and 0.03 eV/A, respectively."}, {"llm generation": "Visible light", "source": "As shown in Fig. 7a, BTO exhibited good absorption property of visible light, with an absorption edge of 445 nm.", "context": "A highly dispersed Bi 2 Ti 2 O 7 in a defective TiO 2 architecture was synthesized by corroding Bi 2 Ti 2 O 7 nanoparticles.Due to the special pyrochlore structure and high Ti content of bismuth titanate, it was hoped that Bi 2 Ti 2 O 7 could be transformed into a highly dispersed Bi 2 Ti 2 O 7 /TiO 2 architecture via a topochemical reaction.As illustrated in Fig. 1, pyrochlore Bi 2 Ti 2 O 7 was composed of an interpenetrating cuprite Bi 2 O tetrahedron with a corner sharing TiO 6 octahedrons, while anatase TiO 2 consisted of TiO 6 octahedrons connected to each other via one edge and vertex.The similar TiO 6 octahedron frame structure made it possible to obtain a highly dispersed Bi 2 Ti 2 O 7 /TiO 2 architecture via a topochemical reaction.At a proper temperature and in a proper H 2 atmosphere, part of Bi 2 Ti 2 O 7 would react with hydrogen, and then phase transition would occur, converting it to defective bismuth oxides and titanium oxides in the reducing atmosphere.After bismuth oxides were removed by nitric acid, a porous, highly dispersed, and defective Bi 2 Ti 2 O 7 /TiO 2 architecture was obtained. To investigate the phase transition process of Bi 2 Ti 2 O 7 in the reducing atmosphere, TG-DSC experiments were conducted.Fig. 2 shows the progress of BTO heated from room temperature to 700 C in a flowing H 2 /Ar (5 H 2 ) atmosphere.The first massloss step appearing at a low temperature was assigned to the desorption of physically adsorbed water on BTO.The second step, with a strong endothermic peak from 400 C, was assigned to the decomposition of BTO in the H 2 /Ar atmosphere.These results indicate that Bi 2 Ti 2 O 7 became more unstable and decomposed above 400 C in the reducing atmosphere.This made it possible to obtain a highly dispersed Bi 2 Ti 2 O 7 /TiO 2 architecture via a topochemical reaction.At higher heat treatment temperatures, a weak exothermic peak appeared from 550 C in DSC, which can be attributed to the phase transfer of TiO 2 from anatase to rutile. The phase structures of the photocatalysts after heat treatment at different temperatures and topochemical etching were measured by powder XRD.As shown in Fig. 3a, pristine BTO matched the standard XRD data of cubic phase Bi 2 Ti 2 O 7 (PDF: 32-0118).The structure of BTO was maintained at a calcination temperature of 400 C in the reducing atmosphere.However, above 450 C, part of it decomposed and transformed into anatase TiO 2 (PDF: 21-1272).As the temperature increased to 550 C, part of the anatase TiO 2 was converted to the rutile phase.For the BTO/TiO 2 -450 and BTO/TiO 2 -500 composites, only cubic Bi 2 Ti 2 O 7 and anatase TiO 2 were found, with no other phases detected, indicating that the topochemical etching process was completed.It is noteworthy that the XRD peaks of Bi 2 Ti 2 O 7 in the composites shifted leftward compared to BTO (Fig. 3b), suggesting a contraction and distortion in the lattice of the composites 38, which may have been caused by heat treatment in the hydrogen atmosphere. The morphology of BTO and the BTO/TiO 2 -500 composite is shown in Fig. 4a to d. Derived from the nanospherical particles of the BTO precursor, the composite's particles retained their original spherical shape.However, their size was slightly reduced after heat treatment in a reducing atmosphere and topochemical etching.Moreover, as shown in Fig. 4c andd, the spherical structure of the BTO/TiO 2 composite became looser than that of BTO due to the etching of bismuth oxides.High-resolution TEM images verified that the etched spherical particles were composed of pyrochlore Bi 2 Ti 2 O 7 and anatase TiO 2 .A clear interface between Bi 2 Ti 2 O 7 and anatase TiO 2 was observable, revealing the highly crystalline nature of the heterojunctions.The lattice fringes of 0.183 and 0.351 nm shown in Fig. 4e The surface chemical state of the BTO/TiO 2 heterostructure was investigated using XPS to explore the heterointerface interaction.Fig. 5a shows that the Bi, Ti, and O elements were contained in the survey scan spectra of BTO and the BTO/TiO 2 -500 heterojunction.However, the intensity of Bi 4f in BTO/TiO 2 -500 was obviously lower than in BTO, indicating that parts of the Bi and O atoms were removed during heat treatment in a reducing atmosphere and topochemical etching.The Bi 4f high-resolution spectra of BTO and BTO/TiO 2 -500 are shown in Fig. 5b.For BTO, two symmetric peaks at 159.1 and 164.3 eV were observed, corresponding to the 4f 7/2 and 4f 5/2 components with a peak separation of E 5.3 eV 39.No additional peaks were detected at lower binding energies, confirming that only Bi(III) was present in the samples.BTO/TiO 2 -500 exhibited similar Bi 4f peak shapes, except for a decrease in peak intensity and a slight shift toward higher binding energies.The decline in peak intensity was due to the decrease in Bi 2 Ti 2 O 7 content in the composite.The shift of Bi 4f peaks toward higher binding energies always indicated a decrease in electron density around Bi atoms, which may have been caused by the interfacial interaction with TiO 2 .In the Ti 2p high-resolution spectra of BTO (Fig. 5c), apart from two peaks at 458.8 and 464.6 eV (attributed to the Ti 2p 2/3 and Ti 2p 1/2 states of Ti(IV), respectively), a strong contribution was detected from Bi 4d 3/2 39.A typical Ti 2p spin-orbit splitting of 5.8 eV and no other lower binding energy peaks were obtained, suggesting the exclusive presence of Ti(IV) 40,27.It should be noted that the binding energy of Ti 2p 2/3 in the BTO/TiO 2 -500 composite shifted to a 0.5 eV higher binding energy compared to BTO, but to a 0.2 eV lower binding energy compared to H-TiO 2 .This indicates the formation of a heterojunction between Bi 2 Ti 2 O 7 and TiO 2 , as it is expected that the interaction between phases changes the chemical environment 41. Low-temperature EPR measurements were performed to detect defects and unpaired electrons due to heat treatment in a reducing atmosphere.A sharp signal at the electron's g-value around 2.002 (Fig. 6a) was attributed to single-electron O 2 A radicals trapped by O 2 adsorbed at oxygen vacancies.Conversely, no obvious signal was detected for BTO, which indicated that heat treatment in the reducing atmosphere resulted in the formation of more oxygen vacancies in the BTO/TiO 2 composite.Nitrogen adsorption-desorption experiments were conducted to investigate variations in the BTO microstructure caused by the topochemical etching reactions. As shown in Fig. 6b, the isotherm patterns for both BTO and BTO/ TiO 2 -500 were IUPAC type IV, but the latter exhibited a type H3 hysteresis loop, suggesting the presence of mesopores caused by the topochemical etching reactions.The BET analysis results showed that the surface area of BTO/TiO 2 -500 was 61.53 m 2 /g, which was considerably larger than both BTO (15.82 m 2 /g) and H-TiO 2 (5.37 m 2 /g).These results indicate that part of Bi 2 Ti 2 O 7 reacted with hydrogen and was converted to defective bismuth oxides and titanium oxides in the reductive atmosphere at a heat treatment temperature above 400 C.Then, severe etching with nitric acid created cavities in the spherical particles, which is key to increasing the specific surface area.This synthetic strategy resulted not only in the introduction of TiO 2 and oxygen vacancies but also in the formation of a new pore structure and an increase in surface area, providing more adsorption and reactive sites during the photocatalytic reaction.The optical properties and band gaps of the samples were studied by UV-Vis DRS.As shown in Fig. 7a, BTO exhibited good absorption property of visible light, with an absorption edge of 445 nm.By comparison, the absorption band edge of H-TiO 2 was at about 436 nm.The absorption spectrum of the BTO/TiO 2 composite was similar to that of H-TiO 2 , but with stronger absorption in both the UV and visible regions.The similarity between H-TiO 2 and BTO/TiO 2 was due to the high TiO 2 content in the latter.The band gap energy of BTO and H-TiO 2 can be calculated using the Kubelka-Munk function, where BTO is an indirect band gap semiconductor and TiO 2 is direct transition 39,42.According to the Kubelka-Munk function, the Eg of BTO and TiO 2 can be estimated from the plots of (ahv) 1/2 and (ahv) 2 versus hv, respectively.The intercept of the tangent on the x-axis provided the Eg of BTO and H-TiO 2 (Fig. 7b).Thus, the band gaps of BTO and H-TiO 2 were calculated as 2.55 and 3.04 eV, respectively.The VB edges of BTO and H-TiO 2 were further measured using XPS valence spectra.As shown in Fig. 7c, the VB edges of BTO and H-TiO 2 were located at about 1.67 and 2.62 eV, respectively.Combined with the Eg and VB, the CB edges of BTO and H-TiO 2 were estimated at approximately A 0.88 and A 0.42 eV, respectively. The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activities of the samples were tested under full-spectrum irradiation and compared with P25.The catalytic reaction was performed in a mixture of CO 2 and water vapor, and the main detected products were CO and CH 4 .All data shown are the averages of experiments conducted in triplicate.A comparison between the photocatalytic reaction rates of the BTO, H-TiO 2 , P25, and BTO/TiO 2 -X samples is shown in Fig. 8a.All samples exhibited good activity reproducibility.For BTO and H-TiO 2 , weak photoactivity and low CO and CH 4 production rates were observed.In contrast, as expected, the BTO/TiO 2 -X samples exhibited superior catalytic performance.Specifically, the BTO/TiO 2 -500 composite had the highest CO and CH 4 production rates.The CH 4 production rate was 6.8 lmolAg A1 Ah A1 , which was 7.9 times higher than that of P25.CH 4 selectivity was defined as the percentage of electrons consumed for producing CH 4 in all photoreduction products according to the formula (1): where n(CH 4 ) and n(CO) are the mole numbers of CH 4 and CO, respectively, produced during the reaction 43.Fig. 8b shows a comparison of the samples' CH 4 selectivity.BTO and H-TiO 2 exhibited 88.1 and 83.5 selectivity, respectively.For BTO/TiO 2 -X samples, CH 4 selectivity first increased and then decreased, depending on the heat treatment temperature.The BTO/TiO 2 -500 composite exhibited the highest CH 4 selectivity (93.9).These results suggest that the combination of BTO and TiO 2 using the topochemical etching reaction strategy improved not only the photocatalytic activity but also CH 4 selectivity. Blank control experiments were conducted to investigate the origin of carbonaceous products.As shown in Fig. 8c, in the absence of a BTO/TiO 2 -500 photocatalyst, CO 2 , or light, almost no carbonaceous products were detected, indicating that the carbonaceous products were indeed derived from the photoreduction of CO 2 .Cycling photocatalytic CO 2 reduction experiments were conducted to study the stability of the BTO/TiO 2 -500 photocatalyst.After each run, the photocatalyst was removed from the reactor and dried in a vacuum drying oven for 2 h.As shown in Fig. S1a andb, the photocatalytic CH 4 and CO production rate of BTO/ TiO 2 -500 exhibited only a slight decline after five cycles, and its crystal structure showed no obvious changes after irradiation for 20 h.Its photostability may have resulted from the in situ topochemical etching reaction strategy, which provided more stable and better blending heterostructures. To investigate the photocatalytic mechanism, PL, SPV, transient photocurrent properties, and electrochemical impedance spectra were studied to evaluate the carrier separation and transmission capacity of the photocatalysts.As shown in Fig. 9a, at an excitation wavelength of 300 nm, all samples exhibited emission peaks from 360 to 800 nm, which originated from the recombination of photogenerated carriers in the photocatalysts.BTO and H-TiO 2 had significantly higher emission intensity values than the BTO/TiO 2 heterojunction.However, BTO/TiO 2 -500 had a higher optical absorption at the excitation wavelength (Fig. 7a).A lower PL intensity typically indicates the suppression of photogenerated carrier recombination and highly efficient charge separation 44.This further confirms that the formation of a heterojunction between BTO and TiO 2 can inhibit the recombination of photocarriers.SPV spectroscopy was conducted to further analyze the photogenerated charge transfer.Fig. 9b shows SPV responses below 420 nm for both BTO and H-TiO 2 , which were ascribed to the intrinsic transition of the photocatalysts.The SPV response of the BTO/TiO 2 -500 heterojunction was considerably higher than those of BTO and H-TiO 2 , indicating a high efficiency of photogenerated electrons and holes separation 45.The results of the transient photocurrent test were consistent with those of SPV spectroscopy.As shown in Fig. 9c, the BTO/TiO 2 -500 heterojunction electrode had the highest photocurrent value under illumination, indicating that recombination in bulk BTO and H-TiO 2 was greatly inhibited.EIS Nyquist plots were drawn to observe the mobility of carriers.As expected, the BTO/TiO 2 -500 heterojunction had the smallest semicircle diameter, corresponding to lower impedance and a consequent robust migration of photogenerated carriers.These results suggest that BTO/TiO 2 -500 had superior separation and transmission efficiency, allowing more electrons and holes to participate in the photocatalytic reaction. To further reveal the factors influencing the photocatalytic activity and selectivity in the CO 2 reduction process, in situ FTIR spectroscopy was employed.The adsorption and activation of CO 2 and H 2 O molecules is an essential step in the process of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.Therefore, an adsorption experiment was conducted using in situ FTIR spectroscopy.As shown in Fig. 10a, pristine BTO and H-TiO 2 showed different adsorption characteristics in the mixture of CO 2 and water vapor.However, when an adsorption equilibrium was reached, monodentate carbonate (m-CO 2A 3 ) at about 1306, 1369, and 1509 cm A1 , bidentate carbonate (b-CO 2A 3 ) at about 1590 cm A1 , and bicarbonate (HCO A 3 ) at about 1458 and 1685 cm A1 were observed on the surfaces of the three photocatalysts 46474849, which indicated CO 2 absorption and activation on all catalysts and suggested the possibility of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O under irradiation.However, it is noteworthy that the BTO/TiO 2 heterojunction displayed almost all the adsorption characteristics of BTO and H-TiO 2 , which indicates that it has more adsorption species and may provide more photocatalytic reaction possibilities. After adsorption equilibrium, the BTO/TiO 2 heterojunction was examined by in situ FTIR spectroscopy to detect the reaction intermediates and possible reaction pathways in the CO 2 photoreduction process and to further explore the reasons for its enhanced CH 4 selectivity.Fig. 10b presents the in situ FTIR spectra of the BTO/TiO 2 -500 sample under light irradiation.With prolonged irradiation, intermediates from CO 2 photoreduction gradually emerged.The adsorption peaks at 1416 and 1536 cm A1 can be attributed to the characteristic peaks of HCO A 3 and b-CO 2A 3 , respectively 49,50, which indicates that light was conducive to further adsorption of CO 2 .A characteristic peak at about 1271 cm A1 was observed, which has been reported to be the absorption peak of CO A 2 radicals.The formation of CO A 2 suggests that the absorbed CO 2 was activated by the photoelectrons from the photocatalyst 41,51.The adsorption peak located at 1365 cm A1 is assigned to the stretching vibration of the CO mode in HCOO A groups 16.HCOO A groups are generally considered products of protonated CO A 2 radicals and are crucial intermediates in CO 2 photoreduction.Furthermore, a set of absorption peaks from 1010 to 1155 cm A1 was observed, corresponding to the characteristic band of C A O in A OCH and A OCH 3 groups 2,52.Moreover, a characteristic peak at about 1516 cm A1 can be ascribed to the dCH 2 vibration of A OCH 2 groups 2.It has been reported that all A OCH, AOCH 2 , and A OCH 3 species are important intermediates for the conversion of CO 2 to CH 4 52.The peaks at about 2885 and 3000 cm A1 , which belong to the asymmetric stretching vibration of C A H in -CH 2 and -CH 3 51,53, gradually increased with prolonged irradiation time.It can thus be concluded that CO A 2 radicals and the HCOOA, AOCH, AOCH 2 , AOCH 3 , -CH 2 , and A CH 3 groups are the key intermediates for the selective photoreduction of CO 2 to CH 4 .Based on the in situ FTIR analysis results, we can infer that the CO 2 photoreduction process on the surface of the BTO/TiO 2 heterojunction is similar to the formaldehyde pathway 54. Liu et al. reported that oxygen vacancies play a critical role in promoting CO 2 binding, activation, and dissociation and stabilizing other reaction intermediates through DFT calculations 55.Therefore, we hypothesize that the abundant oxygen vacancies on the surface of the BTO/TiO 2 heterojunction and sufficient surface adsorbed sites of CO 2 were important factors in the increase in CH 4 selectivity.However, the significantly lower CH 4 selectivity of H-TiO 2 than that of BTO and BTO/TiO 2 (shown in Fig. 8b) suggests that oxygen vacancies contribute to CH 4 selectivity only to a certain extent.Fan et al. 21 found that hydroxyl radicals in a photocatalytic system are a key factor for CH 4 activation.Chen et al. 22 reported that formaldehyde can conveniently be oxidized to CO 2 and H 2 O with the involvement of hydroxyl radicals.The activated CH 4 can react with O 2 to form CH 3 OH and HCHO, and HCHO can be oxidized by hydroxyl radicals.These processes constitute the exact reverse reaction process of the formaldehyde pathway in CO 2 photoreduction.In other words, the production of hydroxyl radicals during the photocatalytic process may be detrimental to CH 4 selectivity.Therefore, the type of TiO 2 -based heterojunction is particularly important for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.The presence of BTO in TiO 2 may be beneficial for the surface properties of a composite photocatalyst.As previously mentioned, BTO has a low oxidation potential.If a type II heterojunction can be formed between BTO and TiO 2 , the transfer of holes from TiO 2 to BTO can reduce the oxidative properties of TiO 2 and the production of hydroxyl radicals during the photocatalytic process.A reduction in hydroxyl radicals can inhibit the activation of CH 4 , thus improving the selectivity and yield of CH 4 . The surface work function (W F ) is an important parameter for predicting the electron transfer within multiple semiconductor heterostructures.Fig. S2 shows the contact potential difference (DCPD) of BTO and TiO 2 , detected by the Kelvin probe, which measured the CPDs between the samples and Au.The W F of BTO and TiO 2 can be calculated as W F (eV) W F (Au) DCPD/1000, where the W F of Au is 5.1 eV.The W F of BTO and TiO 2 were 4.49 and 4.98 eV, respectively, and the Fermi energy level potentials (E F ) of BTO and TiO 2 were calculated to be 0.01 and 0.48 V, respectively, versus NHE.It is universally acknowledged that the interfacial electric field is the primary driving force of charge separation 56.When BTO and TiO 2 were in contact, the free electrons were transferred between the semiconductors due to the different Fermi energy levels until equilibrium was established.The WF measurements also revealed that the interfacial electric field was approximately 0.49 V, directed from BTO toward TiO 2 . To confirm the above assumption, DFT calculations and hydroxyl radical experiments were conducted firstly.The charge density distribution in a slab model of the BTO/TiO 2 heterojunction was used to explore the charge transfer between the interfaces.Considering the TEM analysis results, the BTO (1 1 0) facets and the TiO 2 (1 0 1) facets were chosen as the DFT model examples.As shown in Fig. 11b, there was a redistribution of charges at the interface between BTO and TiO 2 , and Bader charge analysis showed that BTO lost 0.73 electron charge to the top TiO 2 layer.This suggests that when BTO comes into contact with TiO 2 , its free electrons can be transferred to TiO 2 , generating an interfacial electric field between BTO and TiO 2 , which results in the transfer of photogenerated holes from TiO 2 to BTO. To further verify the migration direction of photogenerated carriers and the inhibition of hydroxyl radical production by the introduction of BTO, hydroxyl radical tests were performed using the TA fluorescence method.TA can react with hydroxyl radicals to form 2-hydroxyterephthalic acid (TAOH), which can be detected by fluorescence spectroscopy 33.As shown in Fig. S3, the PL intensity at about 425 nm significantly increased with prolonged H-TiO 2 irradiation time, suggesting significant production of hydroxyl radicals.Conversely, BTO showed a minimal increase in PL intensity.The standard electrode potential of hydroxyl radical formation has been reported to be 2.27 eV 57.Given the VB level of BTO (1.67 eV), hydroxyl radicals in a BTO system cannot be derived from the photogenerated holes of BTO.After the formation of the BTO/TiO 2 heterojunction, the PL emission intensity of TAOH decreased significantly compared with that of H-TiO 2 , indicating the transfer of photogenerated holes from TiO 2 to BTO.These results confirmed the type II heterojunction between BTO and TiO 2 and the transfer of holes from TiO 2 to BTO, which reduced the production of hydroxyl radicals during the photocatalytic process. In situ FTIR spectroscopy of BTO and H-TiO 2 in a CO 2 /H 2 O atmosphere was also used to understand the role of hydroxyl radicals in CO 2 photoreduction.As shown in Fig. S4a andb, a characteristic peak at about 1271 cm A1 was observed both on H-TiO 2 and BTO, suggesting that the absorbed CO 2 could be activated by the photoelectrons on both surfaces.The difference was that more intermediates containing C A O and CO bonds were accumulated on the surface of H-TiO 2 (such as a set of absorption peaks from 1010 to 1155 cm A1 and an adsorption peak at 1365 cm A1 , corresponding to A OCH, AOCH 3 , and HCOO A groups, respectively) 2,16,52.This indicated that the formation and consumption of intermediates containing C A O or CO bonds was the rate-controlling step on the H-TiO 2 surface.This may have originated from the substantial production of hydroxyl radicals on H-TiO 2 , which led to the oxidation of hydrocarbon.Unlike H-TiO 2 , the intermediates on BTO mainly consisted of asymmetric stretching vibrations of C A H (a set of absorption peaks from 2858 to 2965 cm A1 ) 51,53.The results suggest that the rate-controlling step of BTO may have mainly been the formation and desorption of CH 4 .However, with the combination of H-TiO 2 and BTO, the intermediates containing C A O, CO, and C A H bonds decreased markedly, as shown in Fig. 10b.Combining the results of photocatalytic activity, hydroxyl radical tests, and in situ FTIR, we can infer that the formation and desorption of CH 4 was accelerated due to the presence of H-TiO 2 .Meanwhile, the presence of BTO reduced the production of hydroxyl radicals during the photocatalytic process, thereby inhibiting the activation of CH 4 .Thus, the BTO/TiO 2 heterojunction exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity and CH 4 selectivity. Based on the above results, a possible mechanism of the photogenerated carrier transport and CH 4 formation pathway on the BTO/TiO 2 heterojunction is presented in Fig. 12.The design of a highly dispersed and defective TiO 2 /Bi 2 Ti 2 O 7 heterojunction provides an opportunity for the separation of photocarriers.Moreover, it creates more adsorption active sites, thus offering more photocatalytic reaction possibilities.After light irradiation, the photogenerated electrons migrate to the surface and react with absorbed CO 2 to form CO A 2 radicals.Next, the protons are attracted to CO A 2 by electrostatic attraction, forming HCOO A groups.HCOO A groups tend to be translated into CHO A groups, and further intermediates (such as CH 2 OA, CH 3 OA, and A CH 3 ) are produced by successive photogenerated electron transfer and protonation.Finally, CH 4 splits away from the photocatalyst.The formation of a type II heterojunction between BTO and TiO 2 can not only promote the transfer of photogenerated holes from TiO 2 to BTO but also reduce the production of hydroxyl radicals during the photocatalytic process.As a result, an efficient photoredox process can be achieved for the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 to CH 4 ."}], "lamp": [{"llm generation": "Xenon", "source": "The surface photovoltage (SPV) was investigated using a surface photovoltaic test system consisting of a 300 W xenon lamp source with a monochromator and a lock-in amplifier.", "context": "All reagents used in the experiments were analytical grade (purchased from Sinopharm Reagent Chemical Co., Ltd., China) and were used without further purification.Pyrochlore Bi 2 Ti 2 O 7 was synthesized via coprecipitation.Briefly, 0.005 mol of Bi (NO 3 ) 3 5H 2 O was dispersed in 30 mL of acetate with constant stirring to obtain a clear solution.After that, 1.8 mL of tetrabutyl titanate was slowly added to the solution with constant stirring for 30 min to form a suspension with a white precipitate.Then, 60 mL of NH 3 H 2 O (28) was dropped into the solution, and a mass of white precipitate was formed.The white precipitate was then centrifuged, washed three times with distilled water and ethanol, and dried in an oven at 60C for 12 h.Finally, the obtained samples were annealed in a furnace at 500 C for 3 h at a temperatureprogrammed rate of 5 C/min.After cooling down, the obtained yellow powder was ground and denoted as barium titanate (BTO).

First-principles calculations were performed according to density functional theory (DFT) using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) 35.Projector augmented-wave pseudopotential was used to calculate ion-electron interactions 36.The correlation and exchange terms were described using general gradient approximation in the scheme of the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerh of functional 37.For the calculation of charge density differences, a slab model consisting of anatase TiO 2 with a (1 0 1) plane and Bi 2 -Ti 2 O 7 with a (1 1 0) plane was established to represent the contact surface between TiO 2 and Bi 2 Ti 2 O 7 .The primitive cells of both TiO 2 and Bi 2 Ti 2 O 7 were geometry optimized before the construction of the TiO 2 /Bi 2 Ti 2 O 7 heterostructure.To eliminate interactions between the two components, vacuum separation larger than 15 A was employed.The first Brillouin zone was sampled with a 1 A 1 A 1 k-point mesh.A kinetic energy cutoff of 500 eV was used in all calculations.The convergence criteria for energy and force were 10 A5 eV and 0.03 eV/A, respectively."}, {"llm generation": "Gas (mixture of CO 2 and water vapor)", "source": "The catalytic reaction was performed in a mixture of CO 2 and water vapor, and the main detected products were CO and CH 4 .", "context": "A highly dispersed Bi 2 Ti 2 O 7 in a defective TiO 2 architecture was synthesized by corroding Bi 2 Ti 2 O 7 nanoparticles.Due to the special pyrochlore structure and high Ti content of bismuth titanate, it was hoped that Bi 2 Ti 2 O 7 could be transformed into a highly dispersed Bi 2 Ti 2 O 7 /TiO 2 architecture via a topochemical reaction.As illustrated in Fig. 1, pyrochlore Bi 2 Ti 2 O 7 was composed of an interpenetrating cuprite Bi 2 O tetrahedron with a corner sharing TiO 6 octahedrons, while anatase TiO 2 consisted of TiO 6 octahedrons connected to each other via one edge and vertex.The similar TiO 6 octahedron frame structure made it possible to obtain a highly dispersed Bi 2 Ti 2 O 7 /TiO 2 architecture via a topochemical reaction.At a proper temperature and in a proper H 2 atmosphere, part of Bi 2 Ti 2 O 7 would react with hydrogen, and then phase transition would occur, converting it to defective bismuth oxides and titanium oxides in the reducing atmosphere.After bismuth oxides were removed by nitric acid, a porous, highly dispersed, and defective Bi 2 Ti 2 O 7 /TiO 2 architecture was obtained. To investigate the phase transition process of Bi 2 Ti 2 O 7 in the reducing atmosphere, TG-DSC experiments were conducted.Fig. 2 shows the progress of BTO heated from room temperature to 700 C in a flowing H 2 /Ar (5 H 2 ) atmosphere.The first massloss step appearing at a low temperature was assigned to the desorption of physically adsorbed water on BTO.The second step, with a strong endothermic peak from 400 C, was assigned to the decomposition of BTO in the H 2 /Ar atmosphere.These results indicate that Bi 2 Ti 2 O 7 became more unstable and decomposed above 400 C in the reducing atmosphere.This made it possible to obtain a highly dispersed Bi 2 Ti 2 O 7 /TiO 2 architecture via a topochemical reaction.At higher heat treatment temperatures, a weak exothermic peak appeared from 550 C in DSC, which can be attributed to the phase transfer of TiO 2 from anatase to rutile. The phase structures of the photocatalysts after heat treatment at different temperatures and topochemical etching were measured by powder XRD.As shown in Fig. 3a, pristine BTO matched the standard XRD data of cubic phase Bi 2 Ti 2 O 7 (PDF: 32-0118).The structure of BTO was maintained at a calcination temperature of 400 C in the reducing atmosphere.However, above 450 C, part of it decomposed and transformed into anatase TiO 2 (PDF: 21-1272).As the temperature increased to 550 C, part of the anatase TiO 2 was converted to the rutile phase.For the BTO/TiO 2 -450 and BTO/TiO 2 -500 composites, only cubic Bi 2 Ti 2 O 7 and anatase TiO 2 were found, with no other phases detected, indicating that the topochemical etching process was completed.It is noteworthy that the XRD peaks of Bi 2 Ti 2 O 7 in the composites shifted leftward compared to BTO (Fig. 3b), suggesting a contraction and distortion in the lattice of the composites 38, which may have been caused by heat treatment in the hydrogen atmosphere. The morphology of BTO and the BTO/TiO 2 -500 composite is shown in Fig. 4a to d. Derived from the nanospherical particles of the BTO precursor, the composite's particles retained their original spherical shape.However, their size was slightly reduced after heat treatment in a reducing atmosphere and topochemical etching.Moreover, as shown in Fig. 4c andd, the spherical structure of the BTO/TiO 2 composite became looser than that of BTO due to the etching of bismuth oxides.High-resolution TEM images verified that the etched spherical particles were composed of pyrochlore Bi 2 Ti 2 O 7 and anatase TiO 2 .A clear interface between Bi 2 Ti 2 O 7 and anatase TiO 2 was observable, revealing the highly crystalline nature of the heterojunctions.The lattice fringes of 0.183 and 0.351 nm shown in Fig. 4e The surface chemical state of the BTO/TiO 2 heterostructure was investigated using XPS to explore the heterointerface interaction.Fig. 5a shows that the Bi, Ti, and O elements were contained in the survey scan spectra of BTO and the BTO/TiO 2 -500 heterojunction.However, the intensity of Bi 4f in BTO/TiO 2 -500 was obviously lower than in BTO, indicating that parts of the Bi and O atoms were removed during heat treatment in a reducing atmosphere and topochemical etching.The Bi 4f high-resolution spectra of BTO and BTO/TiO 2 -500 are shown in Fig. 5b.For BTO, two symmetric peaks at 159.1 and 164.3 eV were observed, corresponding to the 4f 7/2 and 4f 5/2 components with a peak separation of E 5.3 eV 39.No additional peaks were detected at lower binding energies, confirming that only Bi(III) was present in the samples.BTO/TiO 2 -500 exhibited similar Bi 4f peak shapes, except for a decrease in peak intensity and a slight shift toward higher binding energies.The decline in peak intensity was due to the decrease in Bi 2 Ti 2 O 7 content in the composite.The shift of Bi 4f peaks toward higher binding energies always indicated a decrease in electron density around Bi atoms, which may have been caused by the interfacial interaction with TiO 2 .In the Ti 2p high-resolution spectra of BTO (Fig. 5c), apart from two peaks at 458.8 and 464.6 eV (attributed to the Ti 2p 2/3 and Ti 2p 1/2 states of Ti(IV), respectively), a strong contribution was detected from Bi 4d 3/2 39.A typical Ti 2p spin-orbit splitting of 5.8 eV and no other lower binding energy peaks were obtained, suggesting the exclusive presence of Ti(IV) 40,27.It should be noted that the binding energy of Ti 2p 2/3 in the BTO/TiO 2 -500 composite shifted to a 0.5 eV higher binding energy compared to BTO, but to a 0.2 eV lower binding energy compared to H-TiO 2 .This indicates the formation of a heterojunction between Bi 2 Ti 2 O 7 and TiO 2 , as it is expected that the interaction between phases changes the chemical environment 41. Low-temperature EPR measurements were performed to detect defects and unpaired electrons due to heat treatment in a reducing atmosphere.A sharp signal at the electron's g-value around 2.002 (Fig. 6a) was attributed to single-electron O 2 A radicals trapped by O 2 adsorbed at oxygen vacancies.Conversely, no obvious signal was detected for BTO, which indicated that heat treatment in the reducing atmosphere resulted in the formation of more oxygen vacancies in the BTO/TiO 2 composite.Nitrogen adsorption-desorption experiments were conducted to investigate variations in the BTO microstructure caused by the topochemical etching reactions. As shown in Fig. 6b, the isotherm patterns for both BTO and BTO/ TiO 2 -500 were IUPAC type IV, but the latter exhibited a type H3 hysteresis loop, suggesting the presence of mesopores caused by the topochemical etching reactions.The BET analysis results showed that the surface area of BTO/TiO 2 -500 was 61.53 m 2 /g, which was considerably larger than both BTO (15.82 m 2 /g) and H-TiO 2 (5.37 m 2 /g).These results indicate that part of Bi 2 Ti 2 O 7 reacted with hydrogen and was converted to defective bismuth oxides and titanium oxides in the reductive atmosphere at a heat treatment temperature above 400 C.Then, severe etching with nitric acid created cavities in the spherical particles, which is key to increasing the specific surface area.This synthetic strategy resulted not only in the introduction of TiO 2 and oxygen vacancies but also in the formation of a new pore structure and an increase in surface area, providing more adsorption and reactive sites during the photocatalytic reaction.The optical properties and band gaps of the samples were studied by UV-Vis DRS.As shown in Fig. 7a, BTO exhibited good absorption property of visible light, with an absorption edge of 445 nm.By comparison, the absorption band edge of H-TiO 2 was at about 436 nm.The absorption spectrum of the BTO/TiO 2 composite was similar to that of H-TiO 2 , but with stronger absorption in both the UV and visible regions.The similarity between H-TiO 2 and BTO/TiO 2 was due to the high TiO 2 content in the latter.The band gap energy of BTO and H-TiO 2 can be calculated using the Kubelka-Munk function, where BTO is an indirect band gap semiconductor and TiO 2 is direct transition 39,42.According to the Kubelka-Munk function, the Eg of BTO and TiO 2 can be estimated from the plots of (ahv) 1/2 and (ahv) 2 versus hv, respectively.The intercept of the tangent on the x-axis provided the Eg of BTO and H-TiO 2 (Fig. 7b).Thus, the band gaps of BTO and H-TiO 2 were calculated as 2.55 and 3.04 eV, respectively.The VB edges of BTO and H-TiO 2 were further measured using XPS valence spectra.As shown in Fig. 7c, the VB edges of BTO and H-TiO 2 were located at about 1.67 and 2.62 eV, respectively.Combined with the Eg and VB, the CB edges of BTO and H-TiO 2 were estimated at approximately A 0.88 and A 0.42 eV, respectively. The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activities of the samples were tested under full-spectrum irradiation and compared with P25.The catalytic reaction was performed in a mixture of CO 2 and water vapor, and the main detected products were CO and CH 4 .All data shown are the averages of experiments conducted in triplicate.A comparison between the photocatalytic reaction rates of the BTO, H-TiO 2 , P25, and BTO/TiO 2 -X samples is shown in Fig. 8a.All samples exhibited good activity reproducibility.For BTO and H-TiO 2 , weak photoactivity and low CO and CH 4 production rates were observed.In contrast, as expected, the BTO/TiO 2 -X samples exhibited superior catalytic performance.Specifically, the BTO/TiO 2 -500 composite had the highest CO and CH 4 production rates.The CH 4 production rate was 6.8 lmolAg A1 Ah A1 , which was 7.9 times higher than that of P25.CH 4 selectivity was defined as the percentage of electrons consumed for producing CH 4 in all photoreduction products according to the formula (1): where n(CH 4 ) and n(CO) are the mole numbers of CH 4 and CO, respectively, produced during the reaction 43.Fig. 8b shows a comparison of the samples' CH 4 selectivity.BTO and H-TiO 2 exhibited 88.1 and 83.5 selectivity, respectively.For BTO/TiO 2 -X samples, CH 4 selectivity first increased and then decreased, depending on the heat treatment temperature.The BTO/TiO 2 -500 composite exhibited the highest CH 4 selectivity (93.9).These results suggest that the combination of BTO and TiO 2 using the topochemical etching reaction strategy improved not only the photocatalytic activity but also CH 4 selectivity. Blank control experiments were conducted to investigate the origin of carbonaceous products.As shown in Fig. 8c, in the absence of a BTO/TiO 2 -500 photocatalyst, CO 2 , or light, almost no carbonaceous products were detected, indicating that the carbonaceous products were indeed derived from the photoreduction of CO 2 .Cycling photocatalytic CO 2 reduction experiments were conducted to study the stability of the BTO/TiO 2 -500 photocatalyst.After each run, the photocatalyst was removed from the reactor and dried in a vacuum drying oven for 2 h.As shown in Fig. S1a andb, the photocatalytic CH 4 and CO production rate of BTO/ TiO 2 -500 exhibited only a slight decline after five cycles, and its crystal structure showed no obvious changes after irradiation for 20 h.Its photostability may have resulted from the in situ topochemical etching reaction strategy, which provided more stable and better blending heterostructures. To investigate the photocatalytic mechanism, PL, SPV, transient photocurrent properties, and electrochemical impedance spectra were studied to evaluate the carrier separation and transmission capacity of the photocatalysts.As shown in Fig. 9a, at an excitation wavelength of 300 nm, all samples exhibited emission peaks from 360 to 800 nm, which originated from the recombination of photogenerated carriers in the photocatalysts.BTO and H-TiO 2 had significantly higher emission intensity values than the BTO/TiO 2 heterojunction.However, BTO/TiO 2 -500 had a higher optical absorption at the excitation wavelength (Fig. 7a).A lower PL intensity typically indicates the suppression of photogenerated carrier recombination and highly efficient charge separation 44.This further confirms that the formation of a heterojunction between BTO and TiO 2 can inhibit the recombination of photocarriers.SPV spectroscopy was conducted to further analyze the photogenerated charge transfer.Fig. 9b shows SPV responses below 420 nm for both BTO and H-TiO 2 , which were ascribed to the intrinsic transition of the photocatalysts.The SPV response of the BTO/TiO 2 -500 heterojunction was considerably higher than those of BTO and H-TiO 2 , indicating a high efficiency of photogenerated electrons and holes separation 45.The results of the transient photocurrent test were consistent with those of SPV spectroscopy.As shown in Fig. 9c, the BTO/TiO 2 -500 heterojunction electrode had the highest photocurrent value under illumination, indicating that recombination in bulk BTO and H-TiO 2 was greatly inhibited.EIS Nyquist plots were drawn to observe the mobility of carriers.As expected, the BTO/TiO 2 -500 heterojunction had the smallest semicircle diameter, corresponding to lower impedance and a consequent robust migration of photogenerated carriers.These results suggest that BTO/TiO 2 -500 had superior separation and transmission efficiency, allowing more electrons and holes to participate in the photocatalytic reaction. To further reveal the factors influencing the photocatalytic activity and selectivity in the CO 2 reduction process, in situ FTIR spectroscopy was employed.The adsorption and activation of CO 2 and H 2 O molecules is an essential step in the process of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.Therefore, an adsorption experiment was conducted using in situ FTIR spectroscopy.As shown in Fig. 10a, pristine BTO and H-TiO 2 showed different adsorption characteristics in the mixture of CO 2 and water vapor.However, when an adsorption equilibrium was reached, monodentate carbonate (m-CO 2A 3 ) at about 1306, 1369, and 1509 cm A1 , bidentate carbonate (b-CO 2A 3 ) at about 1590 cm A1 , and bicarbonate (HCO A 3 ) at about 1458 and 1685 cm A1 were observed on the surfaces of the three photocatalysts 46474849, which indicated CO 2 absorption and activation on all catalysts and suggested the possibility of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O under irradiation.However, it is noteworthy that the BTO/TiO 2 heterojunction displayed almost all the adsorption characteristics of BTO and H-TiO 2 , which indicates that it has more adsorption species and may provide more photocatalytic reaction possibilities. After adsorption equilibrium, the BTO/TiO 2 heterojunction was examined by in situ FTIR spectroscopy to detect the reaction intermediates and possible reaction pathways in the CO 2 photoreduction process and to further explore the reasons for its enhanced CH 4 selectivity.Fig. 10b presents the in situ FTIR spectra of the BTO/TiO 2 -500 sample under light irradiation.With prolonged irradiation, intermediates from CO 2 photoreduction gradually emerged.The adsorption peaks at 1416 and 1536 cm A1 can be attributed to the characteristic peaks of HCO A 3 and b-CO 2A 3 , respectively 49,50, which indicates that light was conducive to further adsorption of CO 2 .A characteristic peak at about 1271 cm A1 was observed, which has been reported to be the absorption peak of CO A 2 radicals.The formation of CO A 2 suggests that the absorbed CO 2 was activated by the photoelectrons from the photocatalyst 41,51.The adsorption peak located at 1365 cm A1 is assigned to the stretching vibration of the CO mode in HCOO A groups 16.HCOO A groups are generally considered products of protonated CO A 2 radicals and are crucial intermediates in CO 2 photoreduction.Furthermore, a set of absorption peaks from 1010 to 1155 cm A1 was observed, corresponding to the characteristic band of C A O in A OCH and A OCH 3 groups 2,52.Moreover, a characteristic peak at about 1516 cm A1 can be ascribed to the dCH 2 vibration of A OCH 2 groups 2.It has been reported that all A OCH, AOCH 2 , and A OCH 3 species are important intermediates for the conversion of CO 2 to CH 4 52.The peaks at about 2885 and 3000 cm A1 , which belong to the asymmetric stretching vibration of C A H in -CH 2 and -CH 3 51,53, gradually increased with prolonged irradiation time.It can thus be concluded that CO A 2 radicals and the HCOOA, AOCH, AOCH 2 , AOCH 3 , -CH 2 , and A CH 3 groups are the key intermediates for the selective photoreduction of CO 2 to CH 4 .Based on the in situ FTIR analysis results, we can infer that the CO 2 photoreduction process on the surface of the BTO/TiO 2 heterojunction is similar to the formaldehyde pathway 54. Liu et al. reported that oxygen vacancies play a critical role in promoting CO 2 binding, activation, and dissociation and stabilizing other reaction intermediates through DFT calculations 55.Therefore, we hypothesize that the abundant oxygen vacancies on the surface of the BTO/TiO 2 heterojunction and sufficient surface adsorbed sites of CO 2 were important factors in the increase in CH 4 selectivity.However, the significantly lower CH 4 selectivity of H-TiO 2 than that of BTO and BTO/TiO 2 (shown in Fig. 8b) suggests that oxygen vacancies contribute to CH 4 selectivity only to a certain extent.Fan et al. 21 found that hydroxyl radicals in a photocatalytic system are a key factor for CH 4 activation.Chen et al. 22 reported that formaldehyde can conveniently be oxidized to CO 2 and H 2 O with the involvement of hydroxyl radicals.The activated CH 4 can react with O 2 to form CH 3 OH and HCHO, and HCHO can be oxidized by hydroxyl radicals.These processes constitute the exact reverse reaction process of the formaldehyde pathway in CO 2 photoreduction.In other words, the production of hydroxyl radicals during the photocatalytic process may be detrimental to CH 4 selectivity.Therefore, the type of TiO 2 -based heterojunction is particularly important for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.The presence of BTO in TiO 2 may be beneficial for the surface properties of a composite photocatalyst.As previously mentioned, BTO has a low oxidation potential.If a type II heterojunction can be formed between BTO and TiO 2 , the transfer of holes from TiO 2 to BTO can reduce the oxidative properties of TiO 2 and the production of hydroxyl radicals during the photocatalytic process.A reduction in hydroxyl radicals can inhibit the activation of CH 4 , thus improving the selectivity and yield of CH 4 . The surface work function (W F ) is an important parameter for predicting the electron transfer within multiple semiconductor heterostructures.Fig. S2 shows the contact potential difference (DCPD) of BTO and TiO 2 , detected by the Kelvin probe, which measured the CPDs between the samples and Au.The W F of BTO and TiO 2 can be calculated as W F (eV) W F (Au) DCPD/1000, where the W F of Au is 5.1 eV.The W F of BTO and TiO 2 were 4.49 and 4.98 eV, respectively, and the Fermi energy level potentials (E F ) of BTO and TiO 2 were calculated to be 0.01 and 0.48 V, respectively, versus NHE.It is universally acknowledged that the interfacial electric field is the primary driving force of charge separation 56.When BTO and TiO 2 were in contact, the free electrons were transferred between the semiconductors due to the different Fermi energy levels until equilibrium was established.The WF measurements also revealed that the interfacial electric field was approximately 0.49 V, directed from BTO toward TiO 2 . To confirm the above assumption, DFT calculations and hydroxyl radical experiments were conducted firstly.The charge density distribution in a slab model of the BTO/TiO 2 heterojunction was used to explore the charge transfer between the interfaces.Considering the TEM analysis results, the BTO (1 1 0) facets and the TiO 2 (1 0 1) facets were chosen as the DFT model examples.As shown in Fig. 11b, there was a redistribution of charges at the interface between BTO and TiO 2 , and Bader charge analysis showed that BTO lost 0.73 electron charge to the top TiO 2 layer.This suggests that when BTO comes into contact with TiO 2 , its free electrons can be transferred to TiO 2 , generating an interfacial electric field between BTO and TiO 2 , which results in the transfer of photogenerated holes from TiO 2 to BTO. To further verify the migration direction of photogenerated carriers and the inhibition of hydroxyl radical production by the introduction of BTO, hydroxyl radical tests were performed using the TA fluorescence method.TA can react with hydroxyl radicals to form 2-hydroxyterephthalic acid (TAOH), which can be detected by fluorescence spectroscopy 33.As shown in Fig. S3, the PL intensity at about 425 nm significantly increased with prolonged H-TiO 2 irradiation time, suggesting significant production of hydroxyl radicals.Conversely, BTO showed a minimal increase in PL intensity.The standard electrode potential of hydroxyl radical formation has been reported to be 2.27 eV 57.Given the VB level of BTO (1.67 eV), hydroxyl radicals in a BTO system cannot be derived from the photogenerated holes of BTO.After the formation of the BTO/TiO 2 heterojunction, the PL emission intensity of TAOH decreased significantly compared with that of H-TiO 2 , indicating the transfer of photogenerated holes from TiO 2 to BTO.These results confirmed the type II heterojunction between BTO and TiO 2 and the transfer of holes from TiO 2 to BTO, which reduced the production of hydroxyl radicals during the photocatalytic process. In situ FTIR spectroscopy of BTO and H-TiO 2 in a CO 2 /H 2 O atmosphere was also used to understand the role of hydroxyl radicals in CO 2 photoreduction.As shown in Fig. S4a andb, a characteristic peak at about 1271 cm A1 was observed both on H-TiO 2 and BTO, suggesting that the absorbed CO 2 could be activated by the photoelectrons on both surfaces.The difference was that more intermediates containing C A O and CO bonds were accumulated on the surface of H-TiO 2 (such as a set of absorption peaks from 1010 to 1155 cm A1 and an adsorption peak at 1365 cm A1 , corresponding to A OCH, AOCH 3 , and HCOO A groups, respectively) 2,16,52.This indicated that the formation and consumption of intermediates containing C A O or CO bonds was the rate-controlling step on the H-TiO 2 surface.This may have originated from the substantial production of hydroxyl radicals on H-TiO 2 , which led to the oxidation of hydrocarbon.Unlike H-TiO 2 , the intermediates on BTO mainly consisted of asymmetric stretching vibrations of C A H (a set of absorption peaks from 2858 to 2965 cm A1 ) 51,53.The results suggest that the rate-controlling step of BTO may have mainly been the formation and desorption of CH 4 .However, with the combination of H-TiO 2 and BTO, the intermediates containing C A O, CO, and C A H bonds decreased markedly, as shown in Fig. 10b.Combining the results of photocatalytic activity, hydroxyl radical tests, and in situ FTIR, we can infer that the formation and desorption of CH 4 was accelerated due to the presence of H-TiO 2 .Meanwhile, the presence of BTO reduced the production of hydroxyl radicals during the photocatalytic process, thereby inhibiting the activation of CH 4 .Thus, the BTO/TiO 2 heterojunction exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity and CH 4 selectivity. Based on the above results, a possible mechanism of the photogenerated carrier transport and CH 4 formation pathway on the BTO/TiO 2 heterojunction is presented in Fig. 12.The design of a highly dispersed and defective TiO 2 /Bi 2 Ti 2 O 7 heterojunction provides an opportunity for the separation of photocarriers.Moreover, it creates more adsorption active sites, thus offering more photocatalytic reaction possibilities.After light irradiation, the photogenerated electrons migrate to the surface and react with absorbed CO 2 to form CO A 2 radicals.Next, the protons are attracted to CO A 2 by electrostatic attraction, forming HCOO A groups.HCOO A groups tend to be translated into CHO A groups, and further intermediates (such as CH 2 OA, CH 3 OA, and A CH 3 ) are produced by successive photogenerated electron transfer and protonation.Finally, CH 4 splits away from the photocatalyst.The formation of a type II heterojunction between BTO and TiO 2 can not only promote the transfer of photogenerated holes from TiO 2 to BTO but also reduce the production of hydroxyl radicals during the photocatalytic process.As a result, an efficient photoredox process can be achieved for the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 to CH 4 ."}, {"llm generation": "Gas (CO 2 /H 2 O atmosphere)", "source": "In situ FTIR spectroscopy of BTO and H-TiO 2 in a CO 2 /H 2 O atmosphere was also used to understand the role of hydroxyl radicals in CO 2 photoreduction.", "context": "A highly dispersed Bi 2 Ti 2 O 7 in a defective TiO 2 architecture was synthesized by corroding Bi 2 Ti 2 O 7 nanoparticles.Due to the special pyrochlore structure and high Ti content of bismuth titanate, it was hoped that Bi 2 Ti 2 O 7 could be transformed into a highly dispersed Bi 2 Ti 2 O 7 /TiO 2 architecture via a topochemical reaction.As illustrated in Fig. 1, pyrochlore Bi 2 Ti 2 O 7 was composed of an interpenetrating cuprite Bi 2 O tetrahedron with a corner sharing TiO 6 octahedrons, while anatase TiO 2 consisted of TiO 6 octahedrons connected to each other via one edge and vertex.The similar TiO 6 octahedron frame structure made it possible to obtain a highly dispersed Bi 2 Ti 2 O 7 /TiO 2 architecture via a topochemical reaction.At a proper temperature and in a proper H 2 atmosphere, part of Bi 2 Ti 2 O 7 would react with hydrogen, and then phase transition would occur, converting it to defective bismuth oxides and titanium oxides in the reducing atmosphere.After bismuth oxides were removed by nitric acid, a porous, highly dispersed, and defective Bi 2 Ti 2 O 7 /TiO 2 architecture was obtained. To investigate the phase transition process of Bi 2 Ti 2 O 7 in the reducing atmosphere, TG-DSC experiments were conducted.Fig. 2 shows the progress of BTO heated from room temperature to 700 C in a flowing H 2 /Ar (5 H 2 ) atmosphere.The first massloss step appearing at a low temperature was assigned to the desorption of physically adsorbed water on BTO.The second step, with a strong endothermic peak from 400 C, was assigned to the decomposition of BTO in the H 2 /Ar atmosphere.These results indicate that Bi 2 Ti 2 O 7 became more unstable and decomposed above 400 C in the reducing atmosphere.This made it possible to obtain a highly dispersed Bi 2 Ti 2 O 7 /TiO 2 architecture via a topochemical reaction.At higher heat treatment temperatures, a weak exothermic peak appeared from 550 C in DSC, which can be attributed to the phase transfer of TiO 2 from anatase to rutile. The phase structures of the photocatalysts after heat treatment at different temperatures and topochemical etching were measured by powder XRD.As shown in Fig. 3a, pristine BTO matched the standard XRD data of cubic phase Bi 2 Ti 2 O 7 (PDF: 32-0118).The structure of BTO was maintained at a calcination temperature of 400 C in the reducing atmosphere.However, above 450 C, part of it decomposed and transformed into anatase TiO 2 (PDF: 21-1272).As the temperature increased to 550 C, part of the anatase TiO 2 was converted to the rutile phase.For the BTO/TiO 2 -450 and BTO/TiO 2 -500 composites, only cubic Bi 2 Ti 2 O 7 and anatase TiO 2 were found, with no other phases detected, indicating that the topochemical etching process was completed.It is noteworthy that the XRD peaks of Bi 2 Ti 2 O 7 in the composites shifted leftward compared to BTO (Fig. 3b), suggesting a contraction and distortion in the lattice of the composites 38, which may have been caused by heat treatment in the hydrogen atmosphere. The morphology of BTO and the BTO/TiO 2 -500 composite is shown in Fig. 4a to d. Derived from the nanospherical particles of the BTO precursor, the composite's particles retained their original spherical shape.However, their size was slightly reduced after heat treatment in a reducing atmosphere and topochemical etching.Moreover, as shown in Fig. 4c andd, the spherical structure of the BTO/TiO 2 composite became looser than that of BTO due to the etching of bismuth oxides.High-resolution TEM images verified that the etched spherical particles were composed of pyrochlore Bi 2 Ti 2 O 7 and anatase TiO 2 .A clear interface between Bi 2 Ti 2 O 7 and anatase TiO 2 was observable, revealing the highly crystalline nature of the heterojunctions.The lattice fringes of 0.183 and 0.351 nm shown in Fig. 4e The surface chemical state of the BTO/TiO 2 heterostructure was investigated using XPS to explore the heterointerface interaction.Fig. 5a shows that the Bi, Ti, and O elements were contained in the survey scan spectra of BTO and the BTO/TiO 2 -500 heterojunction.However, the intensity of Bi 4f in BTO/TiO 2 -500 was obviously lower than in BTO, indicating that parts of the Bi and O atoms were removed during heat treatment in a reducing atmosphere and topochemical etching.The Bi 4f high-resolution spectra of BTO and BTO/TiO 2 -500 are shown in Fig. 5b.For BTO, two symmetric peaks at 159.1 and 164.3 eV were observed, corresponding to the 4f 7/2 and 4f 5/2 components with a peak separation of E 5.3 eV 39.No additional peaks were detected at lower binding energies, confirming that only Bi(III) was present in the samples.BTO/TiO 2 -500 exhibited similar Bi 4f peak shapes, except for a decrease in peak intensity and a slight shift toward higher binding energies.The decline in peak intensity was due to the decrease in Bi 2 Ti 2 O 7 content in the composite.The shift of Bi 4f peaks toward higher binding energies always indicated a decrease in electron density around Bi atoms, which may have been caused by the interfacial interaction with TiO 2 .In the Ti 2p high-resolution spectra of BTO (Fig. 5c), apart from two peaks at 458.8 and 464.6 eV (attributed to the Ti 2p 2/3 and Ti 2p 1/2 states of Ti(IV), respectively), a strong contribution was detected from Bi 4d 3/2 39.A typical Ti 2p spin-orbit splitting of 5.8 eV and no other lower binding energy peaks were obtained, suggesting the exclusive presence of Ti(IV) 40,27.It should be noted that the binding energy of Ti 2p 2/3 in the BTO/TiO 2 -500 composite shifted to a 0.5 eV higher binding energy compared to BTO, but to a 0.2 eV lower binding energy compared to H-TiO 2 .This indicates the formation of a heterojunction between Bi 2 Ti 2 O 7 and TiO 2 , as it is expected that the interaction between phases changes the chemical environment 41. Low-temperature EPR measurements were performed to detect defects and unpaired electrons due to heat treatment in a reducing atmosphere.A sharp signal at the electron's g-value around 2.002 (Fig. 6a) was attributed to single-electron O 2 A radicals trapped by O 2 adsorbed at oxygen vacancies.Conversely, no obvious signal was detected for BTO, which indicated that heat treatment in the reducing atmosphere resulted in the formation of more oxygen vacancies in the BTO/TiO 2 composite.Nitrogen adsorption-desorption experiments were conducted to investigate variations in the BTO microstructure caused by the topochemical etching reactions. As shown in Fig. 6b, the isotherm patterns for both BTO and BTO/ TiO 2 -500 were IUPAC type IV, but the latter exhibited a type H3 hysteresis loop, suggesting the presence of mesopores caused by the topochemical etching reactions.The BET analysis results showed that the surface area of BTO/TiO 2 -500 was 61.53 m 2 /g, which was considerably larger than both BTO (15.82 m 2 /g) and H-TiO 2 (5.37 m 2 /g).These results indicate that part of Bi 2 Ti 2 O 7 reacted with hydrogen and was converted to defective bismuth oxides and titanium oxides in the reductive atmosphere at a heat treatment temperature above 400 C.Then, severe etching with nitric acid created cavities in the spherical particles, which is key to increasing the specific surface area.This synthetic strategy resulted not only in the introduction of TiO 2 and oxygen vacancies but also in the formation of a new pore structure and an increase in surface area, providing more adsorption and reactive sites during the photocatalytic reaction.The optical properties and band gaps of the samples were studied by UV-Vis DRS.As shown in Fig. 7a, BTO exhibited good absorption property of visible light, with an absorption edge of 445 nm.By comparison, the absorption band edge of H-TiO 2 was at about 436 nm.The absorption spectrum of the BTO/TiO 2 composite was similar to that of H-TiO 2 , but with stronger absorption in both the UV and visible regions.The similarity between H-TiO 2 and BTO/TiO 2 was due to the high TiO 2 content in the latter.The band gap energy of BTO and H-TiO 2 can be calculated using the Kubelka-Munk function, where BTO is an indirect band gap semiconductor and TiO 2 is direct transition 39,42.According to the Kubelka-Munk function, the Eg of BTO and TiO 2 can be estimated from the plots of (ahv) 1/2 and (ahv) 2 versus hv, respectively.The intercept of the tangent on the x-axis provided the Eg of BTO and H-TiO 2 (Fig. 7b).Thus, the band gaps of BTO and H-TiO 2 were calculated as 2.55 and 3.04 eV, respectively.The VB edges of BTO and H-TiO 2 were further measured using XPS valence spectra.As shown in Fig. 7c, the VB edges of BTO and H-TiO 2 were located at about 1.67 and 2.62 eV, respectively.Combined with the Eg and VB, the CB edges of BTO and H-TiO 2 were estimated at approximately A 0.88 and A 0.42 eV, respectively. The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activities of the samples were tested under full-spectrum irradiation and compared with P25.The catalytic reaction was performed in a mixture of CO 2 and water vapor, and the main detected products were CO and CH 4 .All data shown are the averages of experiments conducted in triplicate.A comparison between the photocatalytic reaction rates of the BTO, H-TiO 2 , P25, and BTO/TiO 2 -X samples is shown in Fig. 8a.All samples exhibited good activity reproducibility.For BTO and H-TiO 2 , weak photoactivity and low CO and CH 4 production rates were observed.In contrast, as expected, the BTO/TiO 2 -X samples exhibited superior catalytic performance.Specifically, the BTO/TiO 2 -500 composite had the highest CO and CH 4 production rates.The CH 4 production rate was 6.8 lmolAg A1 Ah A1 , which was 7.9 times higher than that of P25.CH 4 selectivity was defined as the percentage of electrons consumed for producing CH 4 in all photoreduction products according to the formula (1): where n(CH 4 ) and n(CO) are the mole numbers of CH 4 and CO, respectively, produced during the reaction 43.Fig. 8b shows a comparison of the samples' CH 4 selectivity.BTO and H-TiO 2 exhibited 88.1 and 83.5 selectivity, respectively.For BTO/TiO 2 -X samples, CH 4 selectivity first increased and then decreased, depending on the heat treatment temperature.The BTO/TiO 2 -500 composite exhibited the highest CH 4 selectivity (93.9).These results suggest that the combination of BTO and TiO 2 using the topochemical etching reaction strategy improved not only the photocatalytic activity but also CH 4 selectivity. Blank control experiments were conducted to investigate the origin of carbonaceous products.As shown in Fig. 8c, in the absence of a BTO/TiO 2 -500 photocatalyst, CO 2 , or light, almost no carbonaceous products were detected, indicating that the carbonaceous products were indeed derived from the photoreduction of CO 2 .Cycling photocatalytic CO 2 reduction experiments were conducted to study the stability of the BTO/TiO 2 -500 photocatalyst.After each run, the photocatalyst was removed from the reactor and dried in a vacuum drying oven for 2 h.As shown in Fig. S1a andb, the photocatalytic CH 4 and CO production rate of BTO/ TiO 2 -500 exhibited only a slight decline after five cycles, and its crystal structure showed no obvious changes after irradiation for 20 h.Its photostability may have resulted from the in situ topochemical etching reaction strategy, which provided more stable and better blending heterostructures. To investigate the photocatalytic mechanism, PL, SPV, transient photocurrent properties, and electrochemical impedance spectra were studied to evaluate the carrier separation and transmission capacity of the photocatalysts.As shown in Fig. 9a, at an excitation wavelength of 300 nm, all samples exhibited emission peaks from 360 to 800 nm, which originated from the recombination of photogenerated carriers in the photocatalysts.BTO and H-TiO 2 had significantly higher emission intensity values than the BTO/TiO 2 heterojunction.However, BTO/TiO 2 -500 had a higher optical absorption at the excitation wavelength (Fig. 7a).A lower PL intensity typically indicates the suppression of photogenerated carrier recombination and highly efficient charge separation 44.This further confirms that the formation of a heterojunction between BTO and TiO 2 can inhibit the recombination of photocarriers.SPV spectroscopy was conducted to further analyze the photogenerated charge transfer.Fig. 9b shows SPV responses below 420 nm for both BTO and H-TiO 2 , which were ascribed to the intrinsic transition of the photocatalysts.The SPV response of the BTO/TiO 2 -500 heterojunction was considerably higher than those of BTO and H-TiO 2 , indicating a high efficiency of photogenerated electrons and holes separation 45.The results of the transient photocurrent test were consistent with those of SPV spectroscopy.As shown in Fig. 9c, the BTO/TiO 2 -500 heterojunction electrode had the highest photocurrent value under illumination, indicating that recombination in bulk BTO and H-TiO 2 was greatly inhibited.EIS Nyquist plots were drawn to observe the mobility of carriers.As expected, the BTO/TiO 2 -500 heterojunction had the smallest semicircle diameter, corresponding to lower impedance and a consequent robust migration of photogenerated carriers.These results suggest that BTO/TiO 2 -500 had superior separation and transmission efficiency, allowing more electrons and holes to participate in the photocatalytic reaction. To further reveal the factors influencing the photocatalytic activity and selectivity in the CO 2 reduction process, in situ FTIR spectroscopy was employed.The adsorption and activation of CO 2 and H 2 O molecules is an essential step in the process of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.Therefore, an adsorption experiment was conducted using in situ FTIR spectroscopy.As shown in Fig. 10a, pristine BTO and H-TiO 2 showed different adsorption characteristics in the mixture of CO 2 and water vapor.However, when an adsorption equilibrium was reached, monodentate carbonate (m-CO 2A 3 ) at about 1306, 1369, and 1509 cm A1 , bidentate carbonate (b-CO 2A 3 ) at about 1590 cm A1 , and bicarbonate (HCO A 3 ) at about 1458 and 1685 cm A1 were observed on the surfaces of the three photocatalysts 46474849, which indicated CO 2 absorption and activation on all catalysts and suggested the possibility of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O under irradiation.However, it is noteworthy that the BTO/TiO 2 heterojunction displayed almost all the adsorption characteristics of BTO and H-TiO 2 , which indicates that it has more adsorption species and may provide more photocatalytic reaction possibilities. After adsorption equilibrium, the BTO/TiO 2 heterojunction was examined by in situ FTIR spectroscopy to detect the reaction intermediates and possible reaction pathways in the CO 2 photoreduction process and to further explore the reasons for its enhanced CH 4 selectivity.Fig. 10b presents the in situ FTIR spectra of the BTO/TiO 2 -500 sample under light irradiation.With prolonged irradiation, intermediates from CO 2 photoreduction gradually emerged.The adsorption peaks at 1416 and 1536 cm A1 can be attributed to the characteristic peaks of HCO A 3 and b-CO 2A 3 , respectively 49,50, which indicates that light was conducive to further adsorption of CO 2 .A characteristic peak at about 1271 cm A1 was observed, which has been reported to be the absorption peak of CO A 2 radicals.The formation of CO A 2 suggests that the absorbed CO 2 was activated by the photoelectrons from the photocatalyst 41,51.The adsorption peak located at 1365 cm A1 is assigned to the stretching vibration of the CO mode in HCOO A groups 16.HCOO A groups are generally considered products of protonated CO A 2 radicals and are crucial intermediates in CO 2 photoreduction.Furthermore, a set of absorption peaks from 1010 to 1155 cm A1 was observed, corresponding to the characteristic band of C A O in A OCH and A OCH 3 groups 2,52.Moreover, a characteristic peak at about 1516 cm A1 can be ascribed to the dCH 2 vibration of A OCH 2 groups 2.It has been reported that all A OCH, AOCH 2 , and A OCH 3 species are important intermediates for the conversion of CO 2 to CH 4 52.The peaks at about 2885 and 3000 cm A1 , which belong to the asymmetric stretching vibration of C A H in -CH 2 and -CH 3 51,53, gradually increased with prolonged irradiation time.It can thus be concluded that CO A 2 radicals and the HCOOA, AOCH, AOCH 2 , AOCH 3 , -CH 2 , and A CH 3 groups are the key intermediates for the selective photoreduction of CO 2 to CH 4 .Based on the in situ FTIR analysis results, we can infer that the CO 2 photoreduction process on the surface of the BTO/TiO 2 heterojunction is similar to the formaldehyde pathway 54. Liu et al. reported that oxygen vacancies play a critical role in promoting CO 2 binding, activation, and dissociation and stabilizing other reaction intermediates through DFT calculations 55.Therefore, we hypothesize that the abundant oxygen vacancies on the surface of the BTO/TiO 2 heterojunction and sufficient surface adsorbed sites of CO 2 were important factors in the increase in CH 4 selectivity.However, the significantly lower CH 4 selectivity of H-TiO 2 than that of BTO and BTO/TiO 2 (shown in Fig. 8b) suggests that oxygen vacancies contribute to CH 4 selectivity only to a certain extent.Fan et al. 21 found that hydroxyl radicals in a photocatalytic system are a key factor for CH 4 activation.Chen et al. 22 reported that formaldehyde can conveniently be oxidized to CO 2 and H 2 O with the involvement of hydroxyl radicals.The activated CH 4 can react with O 2 to form CH 3 OH and HCHO, and HCHO can be oxidized by hydroxyl radicals.These processes constitute the exact reverse reaction process of the formaldehyde pathway in CO 2 photoreduction.In other words, the production of hydroxyl radicals during the photocatalytic process may be detrimental to CH 4 selectivity.Therefore, the type of TiO 2 -based heterojunction is particularly important for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.The presence of BTO in TiO 2 may be beneficial for the surface properties of a composite photocatalyst.As previously mentioned, BTO has a low oxidation potential.If a type II heterojunction can be formed between BTO and TiO 2 , the transfer of holes from TiO 2 to BTO can reduce the oxidative properties of TiO 2 and the production of hydroxyl radicals during the photocatalytic process.A reduction in hydroxyl radicals can inhibit the activation of CH 4 , thus improving the selectivity and yield of CH 4 . The surface work function (W F ) is an important parameter for predicting the electron transfer within multiple semiconductor heterostructures.Fig. S2 shows the contact potential difference (DCPD) of BTO and TiO 2 , detected by the Kelvin probe, which measured the CPDs between the samples and Au.The W F of BTO and TiO 2 can be calculated as W F (eV) W F (Au) DCPD/1000, where the W F of Au is 5.1 eV.The W F of BTO and TiO 2 were 4.49 and 4.98 eV, respectively, and the Fermi energy level potentials (E F ) of BTO and TiO 2 were calculated to be 0.01 and 0.48 V, respectively, versus NHE.It is universally acknowledged that the interfacial electric field is the primary driving force of charge separation 56.When BTO and TiO 2 were in contact, the free electrons were transferred between the semiconductors due to the different Fermi energy levels until equilibrium was established.The WF measurements also revealed that the interfacial electric field was approximately 0.49 V, directed from BTO toward TiO 2 . To confirm the above assumption, DFT calculations and hydroxyl radical experiments were conducted firstly.The charge density distribution in a slab model of the BTO/TiO 2 heterojunction was used to explore the charge transfer between the interfaces.Considering the TEM analysis results, the BTO (1 1 0) facets and the TiO 2 (1 0 1) facets were chosen as the DFT model examples.As shown in Fig. 11b, there was a redistribution of charges at the interface between BTO and TiO 2 , and Bader charge analysis showed that BTO lost 0.73 electron charge to the top TiO 2 layer.This suggests that when BTO comes into contact with TiO 2 , its free electrons can be transferred to TiO 2 , generating an interfacial electric field between BTO and TiO 2 , which results in the transfer of photogenerated holes from TiO 2 to BTO. To further verify the migration direction of photogenerated carriers and the inhibition of hydroxyl radical production by the introduction of BTO, hydroxyl radical tests were performed using the TA fluorescence method.TA can react with hydroxyl radicals to form 2-hydroxyterephthalic acid (TAOH), which can be detected by fluorescence spectroscopy 33.As shown in Fig. S3, the PL intensity at about 425 nm significantly increased with prolonged H-TiO 2 irradiation time, suggesting significant production of hydroxyl radicals.Conversely, BTO showed a minimal increase in PL intensity.The standard electrode potential of hydroxyl radical formation has been reported to be 2.27 eV 57.Given the VB level of BTO (1.67 eV), hydroxyl radicals in a BTO system cannot be derived from the photogenerated holes of BTO.After the formation of the BTO/TiO 2 heterojunction, the PL emission intensity of TAOH decreased significantly compared with that of H-TiO 2 , indicating the transfer of photogenerated holes from TiO 2 to BTO.These results confirmed the type II heterojunction between BTO and TiO 2 and the transfer of holes from TiO 2 to BTO, which reduced the production of hydroxyl radicals during the photocatalytic process. In situ FTIR spectroscopy of BTO and H-TiO 2 in a CO 2 /H 2 O atmosphere was also used to understand the role of hydroxyl radicals in CO 2 photoreduction.As shown in Fig. S4a andb, a characteristic peak at about 1271 cm A1 was observed both on H-TiO 2 and BTO, suggesting that the absorbed CO 2 could be activated by the photoelectrons on both surfaces.The difference was that more intermediates containing C A O and CO bonds were accumulated on the surface of H-TiO 2 (such as a set of absorption peaks from 1010 to 1155 cm A1 and an adsorption peak at 1365 cm A1 , corresponding to A OCH, AOCH 3 , and HCOO A groups, respectively) 2,16,52.This indicated that the formation and consumption of intermediates containing C A O or CO bonds was the rate-controlling step on the H-TiO 2 surface.This may have originated from the substantial production of hydroxyl radicals on H-TiO 2 , which led to the oxidation of hydrocarbon.Unlike H-TiO 2 , the intermediates on BTO mainly consisted of asymmetric stretching vibrations of C A H (a set of absorption peaks from 2858 to 2965 cm A1 ) 51,53.The results suggest that the rate-controlling step of BTO may have mainly been the formation and desorption of CH 4 .However, with the combination of H-TiO 2 and BTO, the intermediates containing C A O, CO, and C A H bonds decreased markedly, as shown in Fig. 10b.Combining the results of photocatalytic activity, hydroxyl radical tests, and in situ FTIR, we can infer that the formation and desorption of CH 4 was accelerated due to the presence of H-TiO 2 .Meanwhile, the presence of BTO reduced the production of hydroxyl radicals during the photocatalytic process, thereby inhibiting the activation of CH 4 .Thus, the BTO/TiO 2 heterojunction exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity and CH 4 selectivity. Based on the above results, a possible mechanism of the photogenerated carrier transport and CH 4 formation pathway on the BTO/TiO 2 heterojunction is presented in Fig. 12.The design of a highly dispersed and defective TiO 2 /Bi 2 Ti 2 O 7 heterojunction provides an opportunity for the separation of photocarriers.Moreover, it creates more adsorption active sites, thus offering more photocatalytic reaction possibilities.After light irradiation, the photogenerated electrons migrate to the surface and react with absorbed CO 2 to form CO A 2 radicals.Next, the protons are attracted to CO A 2 by electrostatic attraction, forming HCOO A groups.HCOO A groups tend to be translated into CHO A groups, and further intermediates (such as CH 2 OA, CH 3 OA, and A CH 3 ) are produced by successive photogenerated electron transfer and protonation.Finally, CH 4 splits away from the photocatalyst.The formation of a type II heterojunction between BTO and TiO 2 can not only promote the transfer of photogenerated holes from TiO 2 to BTO but also reduce the production of hydroxyl radicals during the photocatalytic process.As a result, an efficient photoredox process can be achieved for the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 to CH 4 ."}], "reactor type": [], "operation mode": []}}
