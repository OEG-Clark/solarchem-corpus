The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction in a liquid phase was proceed in a 300 mL homemade glass reactor, a 300 W Xe lamp was used as a light source (full spectrum).Firstly, 0.05 g photocatalyst was dispersed in 100 mL deionized water in the reactor under magnetic stirring and the reaction was kept room temperature around 25 C.Before light irradiation, the instrument was initially pumped by high-purity CO 2 .During the reaction process, 1.0 mL of gas sample was extracted at 1.0 h interval.The main gas product was analyzed by a gas chromatograph (GC-7920) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) using N 2 as the carrier gas. The powder XRD patterns are collected on X-ray diffractometer (SMARTLAB, RIGAKU, Japan) with the scanning range of 2 10-80.The scanning electron microscope (SEM) were examined with S-8010 (HITACHI, Japan).Transmission electron microscope (TEM) micrographs were taken with a HT-7700 (HITACHI, Japan) operated at 100 KV.The surface chemical compositions were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) with an Omicron ESCALAB 250Xi (ThermoFisher) probe spectrometer.N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms were tested by a gas adsorption analyzer (TriStar II3020 M, Micromeritics, USA).Raman experiments were performed on a DXR spectrometer.UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra is obtained from UV-vis spectrophotometer (UV-2450, Shimadzu, Japan).The photoluminescence (PL) spectra and transient fluorescence (FL) are obtained on an F4500 photoluminescence detector (Hitachi, Japan).Photocurrent and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were measured by CHI 760e electrochemical workstation.The CO 2 temperatureprogrammed desorption (TPD) are performed on Quantachrome autosorb-iQ-C chemisorption analyzer. First-principle density-functional (DFT) calculation was carried out by Materials Studio to understand the nitrogen vacancy to the effect of band gap, density of states (DOS), CO 2 adsorption capacity, etc.According to convergence accuracy test, the cut-off energy 340 eV, selfconsistent convergence precision 210 -5 eV/atom, and a 221 k-point mesh for the static calculations were chosen in all the systems.The convergence criteria of maximum force for the structure relaxation was 0.05 eV/A, the slab model is a 3 3 1 supercell containing 24C atoms and 32 N atoms. The XRD was used to characterize the crystal structure of the synthesized B-CN and DCN-P powders.The B-CN exhibits two peaks at 13.1 and 27.4,corresponding to its (1 0 0) and (0 0 2) crystal planes, representing in-plane repeated units and the inter layer stacking reflection like that of the graphite, respectively 30313233.In comparison with B-CN, the peaks of (1 0 0) and (0 0 2) become weaker and broader than that of B-CN, suggesting the short-range order stacking of layers along the c-axis in DCN-P.It should be noted that, the peak (1 0 0) of the DCN-P located at around 13.1almost disappear, implying numerous defects may be embedded into the in-planes of DCN-P.These results could originate from the addition of NaN 3 , which acted as sacrificial agent causing the loss of long-range ordered structures within g-C 3 N 4 framework 24,34. Fig. 1b is the Raman spectra of B-CN and DCN-P.For the B-CN, the peaks located at 468 cm -1 , 711 cm -1 , 972 cm -1 , 1234 cm -1 are corresponding to stretch vibration of C-C and C-N heterocycle 4,3536373839.In addition, the above characteristic peaks can also be detected in the Raman spectra of DCN-P.Therefore, the Raman spectra indicated the defects and pore structure did not effect the frame structure of the DCN-P. The morphology of B-CN and DCN-P are investigated by TEM and SEM.As seen from Fig. 2a-c, the B-CN presents irregular blocky-structure, also be curled and stacked together, this may be the main reason of B-CN possess less active sites for CO 2 activation.However, it could be seen from TEM and SEM images that the DCN-P (Fig. 2d-f) displays thinner porous structure, the porous structure may convenient transfer channel, longer contact time and good harvesting ability for CO 2 , and enhance photoreduction CO 2 activity. The surface chemical states of B-CN and DCN-P are investigated by XPS.As can be seen in Fig. 3a, B-CN and DCN-P are mainly contain the C 1 s, and N 1 s peaks.It is worth noting that the N atom ratios for DCN-P is lower than that of B-CN, it may result from the nitrogen defect that reduced the N compose in DCN-P.To further confirm the surface N defects, narrow scan C1s and N1s XPS spectra were displayed in Fig. 3bc.The C1s XPS spectra contained three components located at 288.45 eV and 284.85 eV, corresponding to sp 2 hybridized carbon (N-C N) and C-C 40,41.Additionally, the N1s spectrum (Fig. 3b) at 398.68 eV, 400.74 eV and 401.18 eV are attributed to bicoordinated (N 2C ) and tricoordinated (N 3C ) nitrogen atoms and N-H x groups in the heptazine framework 42, respectively.It is worth noting that the N 3c peak in DCN-P exhibited a small shift to lower binding energy, which could be due to the generation of cyano groups whose N 1 s binding energy are intermediate between those of N 2C and N 3C 43.Further, it can be found that there is no change of chemistry shift appeared in N 2C and N-H x .Interestingly, the area ratio of the peaks C (284.85 eV/ 288.45 eV) for B-CN and DCN-P are calculated as 0.13 and 5.87 in Fig. 3c, respectively, meaning that the N ration in DCN-P is lower.Therefore, the XPS results can be taken as additional evidence for the formation of N-defect on DCN-P.So, the XPS is a strong evidence to explain N-defect formed on the surface of DCN-P. The N 2 adsorption/desorption isotherms of B-CN and DCN-P are shown in Fig. 4a, the sorption isotherms of two samples pertain to type IV isotherm, reflecting the mesopores nature of the materials.The specific surface areas of B-CN and DCN-P are 18.974 and 23.271 m 2 g -1 , respectively.The corresponding pore-size distribution curves of B-CN and DCN-P is 2-15 nm and 10-80 nm (inset of Fig. 4a), respectively.These results reveal that the DCN-P may cause a significant enhanced CO 2 adsorption and diffusion.To further confirm CO 2 adsorption capacity of B-CN and DCN-P, CO 2 TPD are performed and the results show in Fig. 4b.The typical desorption peak of DCN-P is significantly higher than that of B-CN (around 100 C) 44, suggesting that CO 2 molecules are binding more strongly with the DCN-P surface.In order to further validate the experiments result, a theoretically CO 2 adsorption models of B-CN and DCN-P were done.As shown in Fig. 4cd, the two CO 2 adsorption models were constructed.The computational analysis results showed that the adsorption energies of CO 2 on B-CN and DCN-P is 0.02 eV and -0.21 eV, suggesting the N-defects on the surface of DCN-P are helpful for promoting CO 2 adsorption and activation 45464748. The UV-Vis absorption spectra of B-CN and DCN-P are showed in Fig. 5a, it can be seen that all the materials exhibited visible-light absorption, but the DCN-P absorption intensity increased and also had a red shift compared to the B-CN.Moreover, the band gap of B-CN and DCN-P is 2.72 eV and 2.51 eV (Fig. 5b), which reckoned on the basis of Tauc formula (h) A(h -Eg) n/2 , the results are consist with the DFT calculation.Moreover, the conduction band (CB) potential was further investigated by XPS valence band analysis as shown in Fig. 10cd.Therefore, the above results indicating that the foam structure and N defect can enhance the light absorption and reduce the band gap of DCN-P. In order to further explore the charge carriers transfer behaviors, the photocurrent and EIS test were employed.As shown in Fig. 5c, the photocurrent intensity of B-CN (6.8 A cm -2 ) is about 3.5 times high than that of DCN-P (2.2 A cm -2 ), which uncovers the DCN-P has superior carrier separation capability at the photocatalyst interface.In addition, the arc radius of DCN-P is much smaller than that of B-CN (Fig. 5d), which further confirmed that the porous structure and Ndefect results in lowing interface electron transport hindrance. Moreover, the photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved fluorescence (TRPL) was exploited to analyze the separation performance and the life time of photogenerated carriers.As displayed in Fig. 6a, the DCN-P has lower PL emission density comparing with DCN-P.The TRPL decay curves are showed in Fig. 6b, the fitting curves demonstrate the average fluorescence lifetime of B-CN (0.65 ns) is shorter than that of DCN-P (3.23 ns).Therefore, the PL and TRPL results further interpret the DCN-P has superior interfacial carriers migration ability, and expediting the photoreduction of CO 2 activity. The yields of CO and CH 4 was used to evaluate the CO 2 reduction performance of the as-prepared samples.As shown in Fig. 7a, the CO yields of B-CN and DCN-P during reduction CO 2 is 4.1 mol g -1 and 19.7 mol g -1 .And the CH 4 generation rate for B-CN and DCN-P is about 9.6 mol g -1 and 37.1 mol g -1 (Fig. 7b), respectively.Obviously, the photo-reduction CO 2 activity of DCN-P is higher than that of B-CN, indicating that the defect structure significantly affected the conversion rate of CO and CH 4 .Moreover, Fig. S1 shows the recycling results of DCN-P reduction CO 2 , after four cycles the experiments, the DCN-P still keep an excellent photocatalytic activity. Also, as can be seen from Fig. S.2 and Fig. S3, the TEM images and the XRD patterns of DCN-P has no change undergoing consecutive four cycles of experiments, which indicates that the photocatalyst has good stability.In addition, the CO 2 reduction performance of DCN-P with adding different amount NaN 3 are showed in Fig. S4.Furthermore, a table of summary of the present CO 2 reduction results and the published literature studies were included in the Table S1, which highlight the state-of-the-art advancement of this work in the field of CO 2 reduction. The room-temperature electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra was used to understand the changed electronic properties of DCN-P caused by the nitrogen defect.As displayed in Fig. 8a, Lorentzian curves with a value of g 2.0046 are detected in DCN-P, and it shows a much higher the peak intensity than that of B-CN, indicating its higher concentration of unpaired electrons on the sp 2 carbon atoms of the heptazine rings 49505152.Therefore, the EPR results can be regarded as an evidence of the growing nitrogen defect.In addition, to understand the effect of nitrogen defect on the band-gap structure, the XPS valence band is displayed in Fig. 8b, the VB position of DCN-P (1.48 eV) shifts up 0.32 eV relative to that of B-CN (1.70 eV).Thus, the CB of B-CN and DCN-P were calculated to be -1.02eV and -1.03 eV according to the basis Tauc formula (h) A(h -Eg) n/2 (Fig. 5b), respectively.The results imply that the CB position of DCN-P also has up-shift 0.01 eV, which is beneficial for improving the photocatalytic reduction CO 2 .Moreover, the changed band-gap structure is further verified by DFT result, that showed in Fig. 10. In order to make clear the effect of the N-defect on the electronic structure of as-prepared samples, the total density of states (TDOS) and projected density of states (PDOS) of B-CN and DCN-P models were simulated.As shown in Fig. 9a, it can be seen that both of conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) of B-CN are basically composed of Csp orbitals and Ns-p orbitals as well as the DCN-P.Whereas, as the Ndefect are embedded into DCN-P, the PDOS of DCN-P systems is distinctly changed.As shown in Fig. 9b, the contribution of N2p orbital in upper CB area from 0.0 eV to 6.0 eV of DCN-P is weakened, while the contribution of C2s orbital in lower VB area from 15.0 eV to 18.0 eV is enhanced.Therefore, the changed DOS of DCN-P is ultimately affected by the N-defect. In order to understand the relationship between N defects to the effect of band gap, the density functional theory calculations of B-CN and DCN-P were performed, as can be seen Fig. 10, the band gap energy of B-CN decreased from 1.21 eV to 1.11 eV (DCN-P), it is a consequence of the fact that DFT calculation usually underestimates the energy gaps for its own limitation.The general trend is agreed well with the DRS data above (Fig. 6a-b).Further, a defect energy level is appeared (in Fig. 10b), and it must caused by the N-defect.Therefore, the introduction of N-defect can effective narrow the band-gap and introduce the defect level of the semiconductor, which will further improve the light absorption capacity and CO 2 reduction activity. As shown in Fig. 11, we analyzed the differences charge distribution of B-CN and DCN-P.As the blue and red represent the charge loss and accumulation, so that after the introduction of N defect, the electronegativity of the adjacent N atoms are reduced and the C atoms enhanced, which will further decrease the electronic localization and subsequently extend the conjugated systems of DCN-P.Therefore, when the DCN-P was excited, the photoelectrons will enriched around N-defect.This unique electronic structure would increased local charge density at the defect sites, which is benefit for charge carriers transmission and separation, for further enhancing the photogenerated carriers utilization rate. Based on the above experimental and characterization results, the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction process of DCN-P is explained as following: Firstly, the CO 2 was diffused into the porous framework of DCN-P and adsorbed on the surface active sites.After that, under the light illumination, the electrons generated in the interior of DCN-P will migrate to its surface and activate the adsorbed CO 2 .Then, the CO 2 will convert to the CO 2 intermediate, where the \"\" represents the surface adsorption state 53545556.Immediately, the CO 2 will be reduced to CO by obtaining two electrons.Simultaneously, the CO 2 will react with H and obtain eight electrons for the formation of the CH 4 5758596061. Benefiting from the surface nitrogen defect to serve as separation centers, so the photogenerated electrons display greatly longer average lifetime than B-CN, and the porous structure will enhance the CO 2 adsorption capacity.Therefore, the synergistic effect of nitrogen defective-enriched and foam structure will enhance the CO 2 photoreduction activity of DCN-P.Moreover, the photoreduction CO 2 schematic illustration is showed as Fig. 12. In summary, the DCN-P photocatalysts are elaborately engineered and constructed by in-situ doping strategy and freeze-dried method for applying reduction CO 2 , and the CO 2 reduction activity is higher than that of B-CN, which result from the synergetic effect of the nitrogen defect and porous structure of DCN-P.Moreover, the experiment and DFT results suggest N-defect adjusted N2p orbital and C2s in the contribution of upper CB and lower VB, and ensures enhanced carriers separation and narrowed the band-gap, as testified results by DFT calculations.At the same time, the porous configuration favors the diffusion and enhance the affinity of CO 2 molecules, boosting the CO 2 reduction efficiency.It is hoped that this work will provide a new cognitive perspective for building a cross-sectional practical example for improving the CO 2 reduction performance of g-C 3 N 4 .doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2020.124288.

The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction in a liquid phase was proceed in a 300 mL homemade glass reactor, a 300 W Xe lamp was used as a light source (full spectrum).Firstly, 0.05 g photocatalyst was dispersed in 100 mL deionized water in the reactor under magnetic stirring and the reaction was kept room temperature around 25 C.Before light irradiation, the instrument was initially pumped by high-purity CO 2 .During the reaction process, 1.0 mL of gas sample was extracted at 1.0 h interval.The main gas product was analyzed by a gas chromatograph (GC-7920) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) using N 2 as the carrier gas. The powder XRD patterns are collected on X-ray diffractometer (SMARTLAB, RIGAKU, Japan) with the scanning range of 2 10-80.The scanning electron microscope (SEM) were examined with S-8010 (HITACHI, Japan).Transmission electron microscope (TEM) micrographs were taken with a HT-7700 (HITACHI, Japan) operated at 100 KV.The surface chemical compositions were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) with an Omicron ESCALAB 250Xi (ThermoFisher) probe spectrometer.N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms were tested by a gas adsorption analyzer (TriStar II3020 M, Micromeritics, USA).Raman experiments were performed on a DXR spectrometer.UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra is obtained from UV-vis spectrophotometer (UV-2450, Shimadzu, Japan).The photoluminescence (PL) spectra and transient fluorescence (FL) are obtained on an F4500 photoluminescence detector (Hitachi, Japan).Photocurrent and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were measured by CHI 760e electrochemical workstation.The CO 2 temperatureprogrammed desorption (TPD) are performed on Quantachrome autosorb-iQ-C chemisorption analyzer. First-principle density-functional (DFT) calculation was carried out by Materials Studio to understand the nitrogen vacancy to the effect of band gap, density of states (DOS), CO 2 adsorption capacity, etc.According to convergence accuracy test, the cut-off energy 340 eV, selfconsistent convergence precision 210 -5 eV/atom, and a 221 k-point mesh for the static calculations were chosen in all the systems.The convergence criteria of maximum force for the structure relaxation was 0.05 eV/A, the slab model is a 3 3 1 supercell containing 24C atoms and 32 N atoms. The XRD was used to characterize the crystal structure of the synthesized B-CN and DCN-P powders.The B-CN exhibits two peaks at 13.1 and 27.4,corresponding to its (1 0 0) and (0 0 2) crystal planes, representing in-plane repeated units and the inter layer stacking reflection like that of the graphite, respectively 30313233.In comparison with B-CN, the peaks of (1 0 0) and (0 0 2) become weaker and broader than that of B-CN, suggesting the short-range order stacking of layers along the c-axis in DCN-P.It should be noted that, the peak (1 0 0) of the DCN-P located at around 13.1almost disappear, implying numerous defects may be embedded into the in-planes of DCN-P.These results could originate from the addition of NaN 3 , which acted as sacrificial agent causing the loss of long-range ordered structures within g-C 3 N 4 framework 24,34. Fig. 1b is the Raman spectra of B-CN and DCN-P.For the B-CN, the peaks located at 468 cm -1 , 711 cm -1 , 972 cm -1 , 1234 cm -1 are corresponding to stretch vibration of C-C and C-N heterocycle 4,3536373839.In addition, the above characteristic peaks can also be detected in the Raman spectra of DCN-P.Therefore, the Raman spectra indicated the defects and pore structure did not effect the frame structure of the DCN-P. The morphology of B-CN and DCN-P are investigated by TEM and SEM.As seen from Fig. 2a-c, the B-CN presents irregular blocky-structure, also be curled and stacked together, this may be the main reason of B-CN possess less active sites for CO 2 activation.However, it could be seen from TEM and SEM images that the DCN-P (Fig. 2d-f) displays thinner porous structure, the porous structure may convenient transfer channel, longer contact time and good harvesting ability for CO 2 , and enhance photoreduction CO 2 activity. The surface chemical states of B-CN and DCN-P are investigated by XPS.As can be seen in Fig. 3a, B-CN and DCN-P are mainly contain the C 1 s, and N 1 s peaks.It is worth noting that the N atom ratios for DCN-P is lower than that of B-CN, it may result from the nitrogen defect that reduced the N compose in DCN-P.To further confirm the surface N defects, narrow scan C1s and N1s XPS spectra were displayed in Fig. 3bc.The C1s XPS spectra contained three components located at 288.45 eV and 284.85 eV, corresponding to sp 2 hybridized carbon (N-C N) and C-C 40,41.Additionally, the N1s spectrum (Fig. 3b) at 398.68 eV, 400.74 eV and 401.18 eV are attributed to bicoordinated (N 2C ) and tricoordinated (N 3C ) nitrogen atoms and N-H x groups in the heptazine framework 42, respectively.It is worth noting that the N 3c peak in DCN-P exhibited a small shift to lower binding energy, which could be due to the generation of cyano groups whose N 1 s binding energy are intermediate between those of N 2C and N 3C 43.Further, it can be found that there is no change of chemistry shift appeared in N 2C and N-H x .Interestingly, the area ratio of the peaks C (284.85 eV/ 288.45 eV) for B-CN and DCN-P are calculated as 0.13 and 5.87 in Fig. 3c, respectively, meaning that the N ration in DCN-P is lower.Therefore, the XPS results can be taken as additional evidence for the formation of N-defect on DCN-P.So, the XPS is a strong evidence to explain N-defect formed on the surface of DCN-P. The N 2 adsorption/desorption isotherms of B-CN and DCN-P are shown in Fig. 4a, the sorption isotherms of two samples pertain to type IV isotherm, reflecting the mesopores nature of the materials.The specific surface areas of B-CN and DCN-P are 18.974 and 23.271 m 2 g -1 , respectively.The corresponding pore-size distribution curves of B-CN and DCN-P is 2-15 nm and 10-80 nm (inset of Fig. 4a), respectively.These results reveal that the DCN-P may cause a significant enhanced CO 2 adsorption and diffusion.To further confirm CO 2 adsorption capacity of B-CN and DCN-P, CO 2 TPD are performed and the results show in Fig. 4b.The typical desorption peak of DCN-P is significantly higher than that of B-CN (around 100 C) 44, suggesting that CO 2 molecules are binding more strongly with the DCN-P surface.In order to further validate the experiments result, a theoretically CO 2 adsorption models of B-CN and DCN-P were done.As shown in Fig. 4cd, the two CO 2 adsorption models were constructed.The computational analysis results showed that the adsorption energies of CO 2 on B-CN and DCN-P is 0.02 eV and -0.21 eV, suggesting the N-defects on the surface of DCN-P are helpful for promoting CO 2 adsorption and activation 45464748. The UV-Vis absorption spectra of B-CN and DCN-P are showed in Fig. 5a, it can be seen that all the materials exhibited visible-light absorption, but the DCN-P absorption intensity increased and also had a red shift compared to the B-CN.Moreover, the band gap of B-CN and DCN-P is 2.72 eV and 2.51 eV (Fig. 5b), which reckoned on the basis of Tauc formula (h) A(h -Eg) n/2 , the results are consist with the DFT calculation.Moreover, the conduction band (CB) potential was further investigated by XPS valence band analysis as shown in Fig. 10cd.Therefore, the above results indicating that the foam structure and N defect can enhance the light absorption and reduce the band gap of DCN-P. In order to further explore the charge carriers transfer behaviors, the photocurrent and EIS test were employed.As shown in Fig. 5c, the photocurrent intensity of B-CN (6.8 A cm -2 ) is about 3.5 times high than that of DCN-P (2.2 A cm -2 ), which uncovers the DCN-P has superior carrier separation capability at the photocatalyst interface.In addition, the arc radius of DCN-P is much smaller than that of B-CN (Fig. 5d), which further confirmed that the porous structure and Ndefect results in lowing interface electron transport hindrance. Moreover, the photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved fluorescence (TRPL) was exploited to analyze the separation performance and the life time of photogenerated carriers.As displayed in Fig. 6a, the DCN-P has lower PL emission density comparing with DCN-P.The TRPL decay curves are showed in Fig. 6b, the fitting curves demonstrate the average fluorescence lifetime of B-CN (0.65 ns) is shorter than that of DCN-P (3.23 ns).Therefore, the PL and TRPL results further interpret the DCN-P has superior interfacial carriers migration ability, and expediting the photoreduction of CO 2 activity. The yields of CO and CH 4 was used to evaluate the CO 2 reduction performance of the as-prepared samples.As shown in Fig. 7a, the CO yields of B-CN and DCN-P during reduction CO 2 is 4.1 mol g -1 and 19.7 mol g -1 .And the CH 4 generation rate for B-CN and DCN-P is about 9.6 mol g -1 and 37.1 mol g -1 (Fig. 7b), respectively.Obviously, the photo-reduction CO 2 activity of DCN-P is higher than that of B-CN, indicating that the defect structure significantly affected the conversion rate of CO and CH 4 .Moreover, Fig. S1 shows the recycling results of DCN-P reduction CO 2 , after four cycles the experiments, the DCN-P still keep an excellent photocatalytic activity. Also, as can be seen from Fig. S.2 and Fig. S3, the TEM images and the XRD patterns of DCN-P has no change undergoing consecutive four cycles of experiments, which indicates that the photocatalyst has good stability.In addition, the CO 2 reduction performance of DCN-P with adding different amount NaN 3 are showed in Fig. S4.Furthermore, a table of summary of the present CO 2 reduction results and the published literature studies were included in the Table S1, which highlight the state-of-the-art advancement of this work in the field of CO 2 reduction. The room-temperature electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra was used to understand the changed electronic properties of DCN-P caused by the nitrogen defect.As displayed in Fig. 8a, Lorentzian curves with a value of g 2.0046 are detected in DCN-P, and it shows a much higher the peak intensity than that of B-CN, indicating its higher concentration of unpaired electrons on the sp 2 carbon atoms of the heptazine rings 49505152.Therefore, the EPR results can be regarded as an evidence of the growing nitrogen defect.In addition, to understand the effect of nitrogen defect on the band-gap structure, the XPS valence band is displayed in Fig. 8b, the VB position of DCN-P (1.48 eV) shifts up 0.32 eV relative to that of B-CN (1.70 eV).Thus, the CB of B-CN and DCN-P were calculated to be -1.02eV and -1.03 eV according to the basis Tauc formula (h) A(h -Eg) n/2 (Fig. 5b), respectively.The results imply that the CB position of DCN-P also has up-shift 0.01 eV, which is beneficial for improving the photocatalytic reduction CO 2 .Moreover, the changed band-gap structure is further verified by DFT result, that showed in Fig. 10. In order to make clear the effect of the N-defect on the electronic structure of as-prepared samples, the total density of states (TDOS) and projected density of states (PDOS) of B-CN and DCN-P models were simulated.As shown in Fig. 9a, it can be seen that both of conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) of B-CN are basically composed of Csp orbitals and Ns-p orbitals as well as the DCN-P.Whereas, as the Ndefect are embedded into DCN-P, the PDOS of DCN-P systems is distinctly changed.As shown in Fig. 9b, the contribution of N2p orbital in upper CB area from 0.0 eV to 6.0 eV of DCN-P is weakened, while the contribution of C2s orbital in lower VB area from 15.0 eV to 18.0 eV is enhanced.Therefore, the changed DOS of DCN-P is ultimately affected by the N-defect. In order to understand the relationship between N defects to the effect of band gap, the density functional theory calculations of B-CN and DCN-P were performed, as can be seen Fig. 10, the band gap energy of B-CN decreased from 1.21 eV to 1.11 eV (DCN-P), it is a consequence of the fact that DFT calculation usually underestimates the energy gaps for its own limitation.The general trend is agreed well with the DRS data above (Fig. 6a-b).Further, a defect energy level is appeared (in Fig. 10b), and it must caused by the N-defect.Therefore, the introduction of N-defect can effective narrow the band-gap and introduce the defect level of the semiconductor, which will further improve the light absorption capacity and CO 2 reduction activity. As shown in Fig. 11, we analyzed the differences charge distribution of B-CN and DCN-P.As the blue and red represent the charge loss and accumulation, so that after the introduction of N defect, the electronegativity of the adjacent N atoms are reduced and the C atoms enhanced, which will further decrease the electronic localization and subsequently extend the conjugated systems of DCN-P.Therefore, when the DCN-P was excited, the photoelectrons will enriched around N-defect.This unique electronic structure would increased local charge density at the defect sites, which is benefit for charge carriers transmission and separation, for further enhancing the photogenerated carriers utilization rate. Based on the above experimental and characterization results, the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction process of DCN-P is explained as following: Firstly, the CO 2 was diffused into the porous framework of DCN-P and adsorbed on the surface active sites.After that, under the light illumination, the electrons generated in the interior of DCN-P will migrate to its surface and activate the adsorbed CO 2 .Then, the CO 2 will convert to the CO 2 intermediate, where the \"\" represents the surface adsorption state 53545556.Immediately, the CO 2 will be reduced to CO by obtaining two electrons.Simultaneously, the CO 2 will react with H and obtain eight electrons for the formation of the CH 4 5758596061. Benefiting from the surface nitrogen defect to serve as separation centers, so the photogenerated electrons display greatly longer average lifetime than B-CN, and the porous structure will enhance the CO 2 adsorption capacity.Therefore, the synergistic effect of nitrogen defective-enriched and foam structure will enhance the CO 2 photoreduction activity of DCN-P.Moreover, the photoreduction CO 2 schematic illustration is showed as Fig. 12. In summary, the DCN-P photocatalysts are elaborately engineered and constructed by in-situ doping strategy and freeze-dried method for applying reduction CO 2 , and the CO 2 reduction activity is higher than that of B-CN, which result from the synergetic effect of the nitrogen defect and porous structure of DCN-P.Moreover, the experiment and DFT results suggest N-defect adjusted N2p orbital and C2s in the contribution of upper CB and lower VB, and ensures enhanced carriers separation and narrowed the band-gap, as testified results by DFT calculations.At the same time, the porous configuration favors the diffusion and enhance the affinity of CO 2 molecules, boosting the CO 2 reduction efficiency.It is hoped that this work will provide a new cognitive perspective for building a cross-sectional practical example for improving the CO 2 reduction performance of g-C 3 N 4 .doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2020.124288.

The surface chemical states of B-CN and DCN-P are investigated by XPS.As can be seen in Fig. 3a, B-CN and DCN-P are mainly contain the C 1 s, and N 1 s peaks.It is worth noting that the N atom ratios for DCN-P is lower than that of B-CN, it may result from the nitrogen defect that reduced the N compose in DCN-P.To further confirm the surface N defects, narrow scan C1s and N1s XPS spectra were displayed in Fig. 3bc.The C1s XPS spectra contained three components located at 288.45 eV and 284.85 eV, corresponding to sp 2 hybridized carbon (N-C N) and C-C 40,41.Additionally, the N1s spectrum (Fig. 3b) at 398.68 eV, 400.74 eV and 401.18 eV are attributed to bicoordinated (N 2C ) and tricoordinated (N 3C ) nitrogen atoms and N-H x groups in the heptazine framework 42, respectively.It is worth noting that the N 3c peak in DCN-P exhibited a small shift to lower binding energy, which could be due to the generation of cyano groups whose N 1 s binding energy are intermediate between those of N 2C and N 3C 43.Further, it can be found that there is no change of chemistry shift appeared in N 2C and N-H x .Interestingly, the area ratio of the peaks C (284.85 eV/ 288.45 eV) for B-CN and DCN-P are calculated as 0.13 and 5.87 in Fig. 3c, respectively, meaning that the N ration in DCN-P is lower.Therefore, the XPS results can be taken as additional evidence for the formation of N-defect on DCN-P.So, the XPS is a strong evidence to explain N-defect formed on the surface of DCN-P. The N 2 adsorption/desorption isotherms of B-CN and DCN-P are shown in Fig. 4a, the sorption isotherms of two samples pertain to type IV isotherm, reflecting the mesopores nature of the materials.The specific surface areas of B-CN and DCN-P are 18.974 and 23.271 m 2 g -1 , respectively.The corresponding pore-size distribution curves of B-CN and DCN-P is 2-15 nm and 10-80 nm (inset of Fig. 4a), respectively.These results reveal that the DCN-P may cause a significant enhanced CO 2 adsorption and diffusion.To further confirm CO 2 adsorption capacity of B-CN and DCN-P, CO 2 TPD are performed and the results show in Fig. 4b.The typical desorption peak of DCN-P is significantly higher than that of B-CN (around 100 C) 44, suggesting that CO 2 molecules are binding more strongly with the DCN-P surface.In order to further validate the experiments result, a theoretically CO 2 adsorption models of B-CN and DCN-P were done.As shown in Fig. 4cd, the two CO 2 adsorption models were constructed.The computational analysis results showed that the adsorption energies of CO 2 on B-CN and DCN-P is 0.02 eV and -0.21 eV, suggesting the N-defects on the surface of DCN-P are helpful for promoting CO 2 adsorption and activation 45464748. The UV-Vis absorption spectra of B-CN and DCN-P are showed in Fig. 5a, it can be seen that all the materials exhibited visible-light absorption, but the DCN-P absorption intensity increased and also had a red shift compared to the B-CN.Moreover, the band gap of B-CN and DCN-P is 2.72 eV and 2.51 eV (Fig. 5b), which reckoned on the basis of Tauc formula (h) A(h -Eg) n/2 , the results are consist with the DFT calculation.Moreover, the conduction band (CB) potential was further investigated by XPS valence band analysis as shown in Fig. 10cd.Therefore, the above results indicating that the foam structure and N defect can enhance the light absorption and reduce the band gap of DCN-P. In order to further explore the charge carriers transfer behaviors, the photocurrent and EIS test were employed.As shown in Fig. 5c, the photocurrent intensity of B-CN (6.8 A cm -2 ) is about 3.5 times high than that of DCN-P (2.2 A cm -2 ), which uncovers the DCN-P has superior carrier separation capability at the photocatalyst interface.In addition, the arc radius of DCN-P is much smaller than that of B-CN (Fig. 5d), which further confirmed that the porous structure and Ndefect results in lowing interface electron transport hindrance. Moreover, the photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved fluorescence (TRPL) was exploited to analyze the separation performance and the life time of photogenerated carriers.As displayed in Fig. 6a, the DCN-P has lower PL emission density comparing with DCN-P.The TRPL decay curves are showed in Fig. 6b, the fitting curves demonstrate the average fluorescence lifetime of B-CN (0.65 ns) is shorter than that of DCN-P (3.23 ns).Therefore, the PL and TRPL results further interpret the DCN-P has superior interfacial carriers migration ability, and expediting the photoreduction of CO 2 activity. The yields of CO and CH 4 was used to evaluate the CO 2 reduction performance of the as-prepared samples.As shown in Fig. 7a, the CO yields of B-CN and DCN-P during reduction CO 2 is 4.1 mol g -1 and 19.7 mol g -1 .And the CH 4 generation rate for B-CN and DCN-P is about 9.6 mol g -1 and 37.1 mol g -1 (Fig. 7b), respectively.Obviously, the photo-reduction CO 2 activity of DCN-P is higher than that of B-CN, indicating that the defect structure significantly affected the conversion rate of CO and CH 4 .Moreover, Fig. S1 shows the recycling results of DCN-P reduction CO 2 , after four cycles the experiments, the DCN-P still keep an excellent photocatalytic activity. Also, as can be seen from Fig. S.2 and Fig. S3, the TEM images and the XRD patterns of DCN-P has no change undergoing consecutive four cycles of experiments, which indicates that the photocatalyst has good stability.In addition, the CO 2 reduction performance of DCN-P with adding different amount NaN 3 are showed in Fig. S4.Furthermore, a table of summary of the present CO 2 reduction results and the published literature studies were included in the Table S1, which highlight the state-of-the-art advancement of this work in the field of CO 2 reduction. The room-temperature electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra was used to understand the changed electronic properties of DCN-P caused by the nitrogen defect.As displayed in Fig. 8a, Lorentzian curves with a value of g 2.0046 are detected in DCN-P, and it shows a much higher the peak intensity than that of B-CN, indicating its higher concentration of unpaired electrons on the sp 2 carbon atoms of the heptazine rings 49505152.Therefore, the EPR results can be regarded as an evidence of the growing nitrogen defect.In addition, to understand the effect of nitrogen defect on the band-gap structure, the XPS valence band is displayed in Fig. 8b, the VB position of DCN-P (1.48 eV) shifts up 0.32 eV relative to that of B-CN (1.70 eV).Thus, the CB of B-CN and DCN-P were calculated to be -1.02eV and -1.03 eV according to the basis Tauc formula (h) A(h -Eg) n/2 (Fig. 5b), respectively.The results imply that the CB position of DCN-P also has up-shift 0.01 eV, which is beneficial for improving the photocatalytic reduction CO 2 .Moreover, the changed band-gap structure is further verified by DFT result, that showed in Fig. 10. In order to make clear the effect of the N-defect on the electronic structure of as-prepared samples, the total density of states (TDOS) and projected density of states (PDOS) of B-CN and DCN-P models were simulated.As shown in Fig. 9a, it can be seen that both of conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) of B-CN are basically composed of Csp orbitals and Ns-p orbitals as well as the DCN-P.Whereas, as the Ndefect are embedded into DCN-P, the PDOS of DCN-P systems is distinctly changed.As shown in Fig. 9b, the contribution of N2p orbital in upper CB area from 0.0 eV to 6.0 eV of DCN-P is weakened, while the contribution of C2s orbital in lower VB area from 15.0 eV to 18.0 eV is enhanced.Therefore, the changed DOS of DCN-P is ultimately affected by the N-defect. In order to understand the relationship between N defects to the effect of band gap, the density functional theory calculations of B-CN and DCN-P were performed, as can be seen Fig. 10, the band gap energy of B-CN decreased from 1.21 eV to 1.11 eV (DCN-P), it is a consequence of the fact that DFT calculation usually underestimates the energy gaps for its own limitation.The general trend is agreed well with the DRS data above (Fig. 6a-b).Further, a defect energy level is appeared (in Fig. 10b), and it must caused by the N-defect.Therefore, the introduction of N-defect can effective narrow the band-gap and introduce the defect level of the semiconductor, which will further improve the light absorption capacity and CO 2 reduction activity. As shown in Fig. 11, we analyzed the differences charge distribution of B-CN and DCN-P.As the blue and red represent the charge loss and accumulation, so that after the introduction of N defect, the electronegativity of the adjacent N atoms are reduced and the C atoms enhanced, which will further decrease the electronic localization and subsequently extend the conjugated systems of DCN-P.Therefore, when the DCN-P was excited, the photoelectrons will enriched around N-defect.This unique electronic structure would increased local charge density at the defect sites, which is benefit for charge carriers transmission and separation, for further enhancing the photogenerated carriers utilization rate. Based on the above experimental and characterization results, the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction process of DCN-P is explained as following: Firstly, the CO 2 was diffused into the porous framework of DCN-P and adsorbed on the surface active sites.After that, under the light illumination, the electrons generated in the interior of DCN-P will migrate to its surface and activate the adsorbed CO 2 .Then, the CO 2 will convert to the CO 2 intermediate, where the \"\" represents the surface adsorption state 53545556.Immediately, the CO 2 will be reduced to CO by obtaining two electrons.Simultaneously, the CO 2 will react with H and obtain eight electrons for the formation of the CH 4 5758596061. Benefiting from the surface nitrogen defect to serve as separation centers, so the photogenerated electrons display greatly longer average lifetime than B-CN, and the porous structure will enhance the CO 2 adsorption capacity.Therefore, the synergistic effect of nitrogen defective-enriched and foam structure will enhance the CO 2 photoreduction activity of DCN-P.Moreover, the photoreduction CO 2 schematic illustration is showed as Fig. 12. In summary, the DCN-P photocatalysts are elaborately engineered and constructed by in-situ doping strategy and freeze-dried method for applying reduction CO 2 , and the CO 2 reduction activity is higher than that of B-CN, which result from the synergetic effect of the nitrogen defect and porous structure of DCN-P.Moreover, the experiment and DFT results suggest N-defect adjusted N2p orbital and C2s in the contribution of upper CB and lower VB, and ensures enhanced carriers separation and narrowed the band-gap, as testified results by DFT calculations.At the same time, the porous configuration favors the diffusion and enhance the affinity of CO 2 molecules, boosting the CO 2 reduction efficiency.It is hoped that this work will provide a new cognitive perspective for building a cross-sectional practical example for improving the CO 2 reduction performance of g-C 3 N 4 .doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2020.124288.

The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction in a liquid phase was proceed in a 300 mL homemade glass reactor, a 300 W Xe lamp was used as a light source (full spectrum).Firstly, 0.05 g photocatalyst was dispersed in 100 mL deionized water in the reactor under magnetic stirring and the reaction was kept room temperature around 25 C.Before light irradiation, the instrument was initially pumped by high-purity CO 2 .During the reaction process, 1.0 mL of gas sample was extracted at 1.0 h interval.The main gas product was analyzed by a gas chromatograph (GC-7920) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) using N 2 as the carrier gas. The powder XRD patterns are collected on X-ray diffractometer (SMARTLAB, RIGAKU, Japan) with the scanning range of 2 10-80.The scanning electron microscope (SEM) were examined with S-8010 (HITACHI, Japan).Transmission electron microscope (TEM) micrographs were taken with a HT-7700 (HITACHI, Japan) operated at 100 KV.The surface chemical compositions were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) with an Omicron ESCALAB 250Xi (ThermoFisher) probe spectrometer.N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms were tested by a gas adsorption analyzer (TriStar II3020 M, Micromeritics, USA).Raman experiments were performed on a DXR spectrometer.UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra is obtained from UV-vis spectrophotometer (UV-2450, Shimadzu, Japan).The photoluminescence (PL) spectra and transient fluorescence (FL) are obtained on an F4500 photoluminescence detector (Hitachi, Japan).Photocurrent and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were measured by CHI 760e electrochemical workstation.The CO 2 temperatureprogrammed desorption (TPD) are performed on Quantachrome autosorb-iQ-C chemisorption analyzer. First-principle density-functional (DFT) calculation was carried out by Materials Studio to understand the nitrogen vacancy to the effect of band gap, density of states (DOS), CO 2 adsorption capacity, etc.According to convergence accuracy test, the cut-off energy 340 eV, selfconsistent convergence precision 210 -5 eV/atom, and a 221 k-point mesh for the static calculations were chosen in all the systems.The convergence criteria of maximum force for the structure relaxation was 0.05 eV/A, the slab model is a 3 3 1 supercell containing 24C atoms and 32 N atoms. The XRD was used to characterize the crystal structure of the synthesized B-CN and DCN-P powders.The B-CN exhibits two peaks at 13.1 and 27.4,corresponding to its (1 0 0) and (0 0 2) crystal planes, representing in-plane repeated units and the inter layer stacking reflection like that of the graphite, respectively 30313233.In comparison with B-CN, the peaks of (1 0 0) and (0 0 2) become weaker and broader than that of B-CN, suggesting the short-range order stacking of layers along the c-axis in DCN-P.It should be noted that, the peak (1 0 0) of the DCN-P located at around 13.1almost disappear, implying numerous defects may be embedded into the in-planes of DCN-P.These results could originate from the addition of NaN 3 , which acted as sacrificial agent causing the loss of long-range ordered structures within g-C 3 N 4 framework 24,34. Fig. 1b is the Raman spectra of B-CN and DCN-P.For the B-CN, the peaks located at 468 cm -1 , 711 cm -1 , 972 cm -1 , 1234 cm -1 are corresponding to stretch vibration of C-C and C-N heterocycle 4,3536373839.In addition, the above characteristic peaks can also be detected in the Raman spectra of DCN-P.Therefore, the Raman spectra indicated the defects and pore structure did not effect the frame structure of the DCN-P. The morphology of B-CN and DCN-P are investigated by TEM and SEM.As seen from Fig. 2a-c, the B-CN presents irregular blocky-structure, also be curled and stacked together, this may be the main reason of B-CN possess less active sites for CO 2 activation.However, it could be seen from TEM and SEM images that the DCN-P (Fig. 2d-f) displays thinner porous structure, the porous structure may convenient transfer channel, longer contact time and good harvesting ability for CO 2 , and enhance photoreduction CO 2 activity. The surface chemical states of B-CN and DCN-P are investigated by XPS.As can be seen in Fig. 3a, B-CN and DCN-P are mainly contain the C 1 s, and N 1 s peaks.It is worth noting that the N atom ratios for DCN-P is lower than that of B-CN, it may result from the nitrogen defect that reduced the N compose in DCN-P.To further confirm the surface N defects, narrow scan C1s and N1s XPS spectra were displayed in Fig. 3bc.The C1s XPS spectra contained three components located at 288.45 eV and 284.85 eV, corresponding to sp 2 hybridized carbon (N-C N) and C-C 40,41.Additionally, the N1s spectrum (Fig. 3b) at 398.68 eV, 400.74 eV and 401.18 eV are attributed to bicoordinated (N 2C ) and tricoordinated (N 3C ) nitrogen atoms and N-H x groups in the heptazine framework 42, respectively.It is worth noting that the N 3c peak in DCN-P exhibited a small shift to lower binding energy, which could be due to the generation of cyano groups whose N 1 s binding energy are intermediate between those of N 2C and N 3C 43.Further, it can be found that there is no change of chemistry shift appeared in N 2C and N-H x .Interestingly, the area ratio of the peaks C (284.85 eV/ 288.45 eV) for B-CN and DCN-P are calculated as 0.13 and 5.87 in Fig. 3c, respectively, meaning that the N ration in DCN-P is lower.Therefore, the XPS results can be taken as additional evidence for the formation of N-defect on DCN-P.So, the XPS is a strong evidence to explain N-defect formed on the surface of DCN-P. The N 2 adsorption/desorption isotherms of B-CN and DCN-P are shown in Fig. 4a, the sorption isotherms of two samples pertain to type IV isotherm, reflecting the mesopores nature of the materials.The specific surface areas of B-CN and DCN-P are 18.974 and 23.271 m 2 g -1 , respectively.The corresponding pore-size distribution curves of B-CN and DCN-P is 2-15 nm and 10-80 nm (inset of Fig. 4a), respectively.These results reveal that the DCN-P may cause a significant enhanced CO 2 adsorption and diffusion.To further confirm CO 2 adsorption capacity of B-CN and DCN-P, CO 2 TPD are performed and the results show in Fig. 4b.The typical desorption peak of DCN-P is significantly higher than that of B-CN (around 100 C) 44, suggesting that CO 2 molecules are binding more strongly with the DCN-P surface.In order to further validate the experiments result, a theoretically CO 2 adsorption models of B-CN and DCN-P were done.As shown in Fig. 4cd, the two CO 2 adsorption models were constructed.The computational analysis results showed that the adsorption energies of CO 2 on B-CN and DCN-P is 0.02 eV and -0.21 eV, suggesting the N-defects on the surface of DCN-P are helpful for promoting CO 2 adsorption and activation 45464748. The UV-Vis absorption spectra of B-CN and DCN-P are showed in Fig. 5a, it can be seen that all the materials exhibited visible-light absorption, but the DCN-P absorption intensity increased and also had a red shift compared to the B-CN.Moreover, the band gap of B-CN and DCN-P is 2.72 eV and 2.51 eV (Fig. 5b), which reckoned on the basis of Tauc formula (h) A(h -Eg) n/2 , the results are consist with the DFT calculation.Moreover, the conduction band (CB) potential was further investigated by XPS valence band analysis as shown in Fig. 10cd.Therefore, the above results indicating that the foam structure and N defect can enhance the light absorption and reduce the band gap of DCN-P. In order to further explore the charge carriers transfer behaviors, the photocurrent and EIS test were employed.As shown in Fig. 5c, the photocurrent intensity of B-CN (6.8 A cm -2 ) is about 3.5 times high than that of DCN-P (2.2 A cm -2 ), which uncovers the DCN-P has superior carrier separation capability at the photocatalyst interface.In addition, the arc radius of DCN-P is much smaller than that of B-CN (Fig. 5d), which further confirmed that the porous structure and Ndefect results in lowing interface electron transport hindrance. Moreover, the photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved fluorescence (TRPL) was exploited to analyze the separation performance and the life time of photogenerated carriers.As displayed in Fig. 6a, the DCN-P has lower PL emission density comparing with DCN-P.The TRPL decay curves are showed in Fig. 6b, the fitting curves demonstrate the average fluorescence lifetime of B-CN (0.65 ns) is shorter than that of DCN-P (3.23 ns).Therefore, the PL and TRPL results further interpret the DCN-P has superior interfacial carriers migration ability, and expediting the photoreduction of CO 2 activity. The yields of CO and CH 4 was used to evaluate the CO 2 reduction performance of the as-prepared samples.As shown in Fig. 7a, the CO yields of B-CN and DCN-P during reduction CO 2 is 4.1 mol g -1 and 19.7 mol g -1 .And the CH 4 generation rate for B-CN and DCN-P is about 9.6 mol g -1 and 37.1 mol g -1 (Fig. 7b), respectively.Obviously, the photo-reduction CO 2 activity of DCN-P is higher than that of B-CN, indicating that the defect structure significantly affected the conversion rate of CO and CH 4 .Moreover, Fig. S1 shows the recycling results of DCN-P reduction CO 2 , after four cycles the experiments, the DCN-P still keep an excellent photocatalytic activity. Also, as can be seen from Fig. S.2 and Fig. S3, the TEM images and the XRD patterns of DCN-P has no change undergoing consecutive four cycles of experiments, which indicates that the photocatalyst has good stability.In addition, the CO 2 reduction performance of DCN-P with adding different amount NaN 3 are showed in Fig. S4.Furthermore, a table of summary of the present CO 2 reduction results and the published literature studies were included in the Table S1, which highlight the state-of-the-art advancement of this work in the field of CO 2 reduction. The room-temperature electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra was used to understand the changed electronic properties of DCN-P caused by the nitrogen defect.As displayed in Fig. 8a, Lorentzian curves with a value of g 2.0046 are detected in DCN-P, and it shows a much higher the peak intensity than that of B-CN, indicating its higher concentration of unpaired electrons on the sp 2 carbon atoms of the heptazine rings 49505152.Therefore, the EPR results can be regarded as an evidence of the growing nitrogen defect.In addition, to understand the effect of nitrogen defect on the band-gap structure, the XPS valence band is displayed in Fig. 8b, the VB position of DCN-P (1.48 eV) shifts up 0.32 eV relative to that of B-CN (1.70 eV).Thus, the CB of B-CN and DCN-P were calculated to be -1.02eV and -1.03 eV according to the basis Tauc formula (h) A(h -Eg) n/2 (Fig. 5b), respectively.The results imply that the CB position of DCN-P also has up-shift 0.01 eV, which is beneficial for improving the photocatalytic reduction CO 2 .Moreover, the changed band-gap structure is further verified by DFT result, that showed in Fig. 10. In order to make clear the effect of the N-defect on the electronic structure of as-prepared samples, the total density of states (TDOS) and projected density of states (PDOS) of B-CN and DCN-P models were simulated.As shown in Fig. 9a, it can be seen that both of conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) of B-CN are basically composed of Csp orbitals and Ns-p orbitals as well as the DCN-P.Whereas, as the Ndefect are embedded into DCN-P, the PDOS of DCN-P systems is distinctly changed.As shown in Fig. 9b, the contribution of N2p orbital in upper CB area from 0.0 eV to 6.0 eV of DCN-P is weakened, while the contribution of C2s orbital in lower VB area from 15.0 eV to 18.0 eV is enhanced.Therefore, the changed DOS of DCN-P is ultimately affected by the N-defect. In order to understand the relationship between N defects to the effect of band gap, the density functional theory calculations of B-CN and DCN-P were performed, as can be seen Fig. 10, the band gap energy of B-CN decreased from 1.21 eV to 1.11 eV (DCN-P), it is a consequence of the fact that DFT calculation usually underestimates the energy gaps for its own limitation.The general trend is agreed well with the DRS data above (Fig. 6a-b).Further, a defect energy level is appeared (in Fig. 10b), and it must caused by the N-defect.Therefore, the introduction of N-defect can effective narrow the band-gap and introduce the defect level of the semiconductor, which will further improve the light absorption capacity and CO 2 reduction activity. As shown in Fig. 11, we analyzed the differences charge distribution of B-CN and DCN-P.As the blue and red represent the charge loss and accumulation, so that after the introduction of N defect, the electronegativity of the adjacent N atoms are reduced and the C atoms enhanced, which will further decrease the electronic localization and subsequently extend the conjugated systems of DCN-P.Therefore, when the DCN-P was excited, the photoelectrons will enriched around N-defect.This unique electronic structure would increased local charge density at the defect sites, which is benefit for charge carriers transmission and separation, for further enhancing the photogenerated carriers utilization rate. Based on the above experimental and characterization results, the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction process of DCN-P is explained as following: Firstly, the CO 2 was diffused into the porous framework of DCN-P and adsorbed on the surface active sites.After that, under the light illumination, the electrons generated in the interior of DCN-P will migrate to its surface and activate the adsorbed CO 2 .Then, the CO 2 will convert to the CO 2 intermediate, where the \"\" represents the surface adsorption state 53545556.Immediately, the CO 2 will be reduced to CO by obtaining two electrons.Simultaneously, the CO 2 will react with H and obtain eight electrons for the formation of the CH 4 5758596061. Benefiting from the surface nitrogen defect to serve as separation centers, so the photogenerated electrons display greatly longer average lifetime than B-CN, and the porous structure will enhance the CO 2 adsorption capacity.Therefore, the synergistic effect of nitrogen defective-enriched and foam structure will enhance the CO 2 photoreduction activity of DCN-P.Moreover, the photoreduction CO 2 schematic illustration is showed as Fig. 12. In summary, the DCN-P photocatalysts are elaborately engineered and constructed by in-situ doping strategy and freeze-dried method for applying reduction CO 2 , and the CO 2 reduction activity is higher than that of B-CN, which result from the synergetic effect of the nitrogen defect and porous structure of DCN-P.Moreover, the experiment and DFT results suggest N-defect adjusted N2p orbital and C2s in the contribution of upper CB and lower VB, and ensures enhanced carriers separation and narrowed the band-gap, as testified results by DFT calculations.At the same time, the porous configuration favors the diffusion and enhance the affinity of CO 2 molecules, boosting the CO 2 reduction efficiency.It is hoped that this work will provide a new cognitive perspective for building a cross-sectional practical example for improving the CO 2 reduction performance of g-C 3 N 4 .doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2020.124288.
