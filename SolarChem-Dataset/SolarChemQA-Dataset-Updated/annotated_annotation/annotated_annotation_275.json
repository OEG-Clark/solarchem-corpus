The facet 3 1 1 was chosen to calculate the crystallite size by using the Debyee-Scherrer equation and lattice spacing, the results are listed in Table 1. The morphologies and microstructures of the samples were further characterized by SEM and TEM.As shown in Fig. 2(a) and (b), marigold-like CdIn 2 S 4 spheres with an average diameter of 5 m were assembled by numerous flakes.Fig. 2(g) and (h) showed the HRTEM images of the CdIn 2 S 4 synthesized from l-cysteine.The lattice spacings between (3 1 1) and (2 2 0) facets were 3.295 A and 3.846 A respectively, which were in accordance with the XRD analysis. In Fig. 2(c) and (d) the morphologies of CdIn 2 S 4 synthesized from thioacetamide and thiourea were different from that synthesized from l-cysteine.Although synthesis condition was the same, the CdIn 2 S 4 from thioacetamide had an average diameter of 4 m and was composed of dozen of flakes and particles, which were accumulated to form irregular and looser spheres than that from l-cysteine.When sulfur source changed to thiourea, the CdIn 2 S 4 exhibited much larger diameter of 9 m, and some bipyramid-like particles aggregated on its spheric surface. Undoubtedly, coordination ability of sulfur sources plays a key role in morphologies of CdIn 2 S 4 .l-cysteine can coordinate with In 3 and CdIn 2 S 4 strongly to form precursor complexes, but lower coordination abilities are given by thioacetamide and thiourea 15. The BET specific surface areas of the as-prepared CdIn 2 S 4 samples were calculated and summarized in Table 2.It is obvious that the CdIn 2 S 4 synthesized from l-cysteine and thioacetamide had much larger surface area than that from thiourea, and the largest one was CdIn 2 S 4 synthesized from l-cysteine.The reason could be found by observing the puffy appearance of two samples with larger surface area and the dense appearance of the sample from thiourea in Fig. 2(b),(d) and (f).The smaller crystallite size of sample from l-cysteine also leads to a larger specific surface area.Compared images in Fig. 2, the CdIn 2 S 4 prepared from l-cysteine has more perfect morphology, which will provide larger irritated area and result in a higher absorbance.Large surface area of microsphere not only provides more active sites, but also enhances the ability of light absorption 16,17. Fig. 3 showed the UV-vis diffuse reflection spectra (DRS) of the catalysts prepared from three different sulfur sources.The absorption edges of the CdIn 2 S 4 samples synthesized from lcysteine, thiourea and thioacetamide were 737, 592 and 605 nm, the corresponding band gaps were 1.68, 2.09 and 2.05 eV, respectively.The smaller value of absorption edge of the sample from l-cysteine could contribute to its smaller crystal size and regular morphology, which reflected an opened architecture constituted of many nanosheets.Such kind of 3D nanocomposite could prohibited recombination of electron-hole pairs 18.The band gap energy of CdIn 2 S 4 synthesized from l-cysteine is suitable to visible light photocatalysis even more. The conduction band edge (E CB ) and valence band edge (E VB ) were also calculated by the empirical equation 21 and displayed in Table 3. 2857 3604 5258 Photocatalytic activities of CdIn2S4 under Ar condition. 2884 2030 2163 Table 4 shows a comparison of the photocatalytic activity of the CdIn 2 S 4 catalysts prepared from three different sulphur sources.Obviously, the catalyst prepared from l-cysteine had a unique photocatalytic property in both products of dimethoxymethane (DMM) and methyl formate (MF).While the other two catalysts only promoted the formation of MF, and the total formation rates were lower than CdIn 2 S 4 synthesized from l-cysteine. In order to deeply understand the reaction, blank experiments were carried out.Firstly, we substituted Ar for CO 2 and the results were displayed in Table 5.The formation rate of MF over the catalyst synthesized from l-cysteine was almost the same as that in CO 2 passing through the reactor, but DMM was not detected.Meanwhile, the bubbling of Ar gas results in MF evolution rate decreased for the catalysts synthesized from thioacetamide and thiourea. We summarized the photocatalytic mechanism in Fig. 4. Due to the narrow band gap of 1.68 eV and the potential energies of conduction and valance bands of CdIn 2 S 4 (l-cysteine) were more negative than that of reducing CO 2 to formaldehyde and more positive than that to oxidize methanol to formic acid 19,20.So the formaldehyde from reducing CO 2 on the conduction band (CB) would react with methanol to produce DMM through aldol condensation.Meanwhile, the formic acid coming from methanol oxidation could react with methanol to produce MF through esterification.While at the presence of the Ar, no formaldehyde was generated and led to an undetected DMM. But for the rest two kinds of CdIn 2 S 4 catalysts synthesized from thioacetamide and thiourea, their potential energies of CB were much more negative than that of CdIn 2 S 4 catalysts synthesized from l-cysteine, so that CO 2 could be reduced to formic acid, and on the VB methanol would be oxidized to formic acid too, which would react with methanol in bulk to form MF. That is the reason of the unique product to be MF.While under the Ar condition the MF generated from CO 2 reduction was impossible, the only way was methanol oxidation and etherification.In summary, the catalyst from l-cysteine has a tendency to transform CO 2 to DMM, while the other two catalysts enhance to form MF only.The large surface area and an extensive light absorption resulted in the most positive photocatalytic activity. Here methanol was taken as both sacrificial reagent and solvent to effectively enhance the separation the electron-hole pairs in VB or CB and the solubility of CO 2 in liquid phase."}, {"llm generation": "Liquid", "source": "However, the MF was the only product of photocatalytically conversing CO 2 in methanol over the CdIn 2 S 4 microspheres synthesized from thioacetamide and thiourea.", "context": "Microspheric CdIn 2 S 4 photocatalysts were prepared by hydrothermal synthesis and using three different sulfur sources, which resulted in different band gaps and potential energies on CB and VB.Among them CdIn 2 S 4 prepared from l-cysteine possessed the most perfect spheric morphology, larger surface area and stronger absorbility to visible light, which collaborated to the high evolution rates of DMM and MF.However, the MF was the only product of photocatalytically conversing CO 2 in methanol over the CdIn 2 S 4 microspheres synthesized from thioacetamide and thiourea.The photocatalytic mechanisms were proposed for deeply understanding the reaction and designing the photocatalysts.Furthermore, the novel CdIn 2 S 4 specially synthesized from l-cysteine has a potentially prospective application in utilizing the solar energy.
