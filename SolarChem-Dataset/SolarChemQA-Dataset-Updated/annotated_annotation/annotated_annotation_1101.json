To investigate the structural changes resulting from the modification with Zn and their role in the consistently high selectivity for CO formation, the Ag/Zn/ZnTa 2 O 6 catalysts were thoroughly characterized.Figure 2 shows the XRD patterns of the prepared catalysts.Regarding ZnTa 2 O 6 (Figure 2Aa), the observed Pnab (60) space group (ICSD no.36289) was in accordance with previous reports. 19,34Further, most of the XRD peaks of the modified Zn/ZnTa 2 O 6 catalysts were attributed to the ZnTa 2 O 6 phase.The increase in the amount of Zn from 2.5 to 40 mol did not cause the peaks to shift (Figure 2B), indicating that the Zn modification did not influence the crystal structure of ZnTa 2 O 6 .Thus, the Zn ion (0.074 nm) did not dope the ZnTa 2 O 6 (Ta 5 0.062 nm) crystal as predicted by Bragg's Law. 35In contrast, the Zn species covered the surface of ZnTa 2 O 6 .Additionally, the XRD pattern for Zn 3 Ta 2 O 8 was also obtained as a reference.The peaks corresponding to the latter were observed in the patterns of the catalysts modified with at least 20 mol Zn (Figure 2Ae-f).Additionally, the unknown peak at 23.2, which is visible in the patterns of catalysts with over 15 mol Zn, was tentatively assigned to an unknown type of zinc tantalum oxide.Given the poor performance of 3.0Ag/Zn 3 Ta 2 O 8 as a CO 2 conversion photocatalyst (8.2 mol h -1 CO formation rate and 56.4 CO evolution selectivity, Figure S1), we concluded that the lower photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity of catalysts modified with over 15 mol Zn was due to formation of a Zn 3 Ta 2 O 8 layer on the surface of ZnTa 2 O 6 . The UV-vis spectra of the ZnTa 2 O 6 -based catalysts are shown in Figure S2.The absorption edge of ZnTa 2 O 6 was located at approximately 270 nm in accordance with previous reports. 19,34Additionally, the absorption edge wavelengths of the Zn-modified ZnTa 2 O 6 catalysts were similar to that of ZnTa 2 O 6 .Furthermore, the catalysts modified with more than 10 Zn exhibited a broad absorption peak at approximately The Journal of Physical Chemistry C 370 nm (Figure S2c-f), which is similar to that observed in the spectrum of Zn 3 Ta 2 O 8 (Figure S2g).Moreover, the UVvis spectra of 10Zn/ZnTa 2 O 6 and 3.0Ag/10Zn/ZnTa 2 O 6 (Figure S3) feature a broad absorption at a long wavelength, which presumably stems from the plasmonic absorption of the Ag nanoparticles on the surface of the catalysts. 3637738 Further, the SEM images of the various Zn/ZnTa 2 O 6 catalysts revealed that their morphology and microstructure did not change significantly upon modification with Zn (Figure S4). The X-ray photoelectron spectra of Zn 2p and Ta 4f, depicted in Figure 3, were calibrated using the C 1s peak (284.6 eV, Figure S5).The Zn 2p 3/2 and Zn 2p 1/2 peaks of ZnO were observed at 1021.8 and 1045.0 eV, respectively (Figure 3A) and were similarly located in the spectra of ZnTa 2 O 6 , 10Zn/ZnTa 2 O 6 (before and after calcination), Zn 1.1 Ta 2 O 6 , and Zn 3 Ta 2 O 6 .Thus, the Zn species of 10Zn/ ZnTa 2 O 6 are divalent cations (Zn 2 ).In Figure 3B, the peaks of the ZnTa 2 O 6 catalyst located at 26.1 and 27.9 eV were attributed to Ta 4f 7/2 and Ta 4f 5/2 , respectively.The Ta 4f peaks of noncalcinated 10Zn/ZnTa 2 O 6 were detected at similar binding energies as those of ZnTa 2 O 6 .However, the corresponding 10Zn/ZnTa 2 O 6 peaks shifted to slightly lower energy values, whereas those of Zn 3 Ta 2 O 8 underwent a larger shift.Previous reports state that the increase in the average electronegativity of the ligand leads to an increase in the binding energy of the ion. 39,40 ZnTa 2 O 6 .The Zn:Ta ratios of ZnTa 2 O 6 , 10Zn/ZnTa 2 O 6 , 3.0Ag/10Zn/ZnTa 2 O 6 , and Zn 3 Ta 2 O 8 are listed in Table S1.The Zn:Ta ratio of Zn/ZnTa 2 O 6 determined by XPS is significantly higher than that obtained by EDS mapping; therefore, we conclude that most of the modified Zn species exists on the surface of the photocatalyst. 42dditionally, the local structure of the Zn species in the Zn/ ZnTa 2 O 6 catalysts was examined by XAFS measurements.The Zn K-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) data of different zinc compounds, including the reference samples Zn foil, ZnO, ZnTa 2 O 6 , and Zn 3 Ta 2 O 6 , are presented in Figure 4.The Zn K-edge XANES spectra of Zn/ZnTa 2 O 6 were similar to that of ZnTa 2 O 6 , regardless of the amount of modified Zn (2.5-40 mol range).Furthermore, the Ta L IIIedge XANES data of the Zn/ZnTa 2 O 6 catalysts were also consistent with that of ZnTa 2 O 6 (Figure 4B).However, the increase in the amount of modified Zn from 2.5 to 40 mol led to a decrease in the intensity of the Zn K-edge XANES spectra feature peak and in the adsorption edge energy (Figures 4C andD, respectively).Importantly, the adsorption edge energy correlates with the valence state of the detected elements.Hence, the regular shift of the adsorption edge energy of catalysts modified with different amounts of Zn indicates changes in the local structure surrounding the Zn ions. 43,44igure 5 shows the influence of the Ag cocatalyst loading method on the photocatalytic CO 2 conversion performance of 1.5Ag/10Zn/ZnTa 2 O 6 .The catalyst fabricated by the CR and PD methods exhibited similar initial CO formation rates (16.9 mol h -1 ) and CO evolution selectivities (83.0-86.0).In contrast, the initial CO formation rate and CO evolution selectivity of the catalyst prepared by the IMP method were 20.0 mol h -1 and approximately 90, respectively.The SEM images of the differently fabricated 1.5Ag/10Zn/ZnTa 2 O 6 , shown in Figures S6 andS7, reveal that the Ag nanoparticles obtained by the CR and PD methods were large, whereas those resulting from IMP were small and well-dispersed on the ZnTa 2 O 6 surface, as confirmed by the corresponding EDS mapping (Figure S7c).Moreover, several nanoparticles (40-80 nm) appeared on the surface of 10Zn/ZnTa 2 O 6 upon photoirradiation for 5 h (Figures S6a,d).In addition, Figure S6e,f shows a slight increase in the size of the Ag nanoparticles prepared by the CR and PD methods after 5 h of photocatalytic reaction.Importantly, the Ag nanoparticles, which act as cocatalysts, were aggregated on the surface of the ZnTa 2 O 6 and did not interfere with the ZnTa 2 O 6 structure. Figure 6 shows the dependence of the product formation rates on the Ag cocatalyst loading.The CO evolution selectivity of the 10Zn/ZnTa 2 O 6 catalyst (without Ag) was relatively high (71.8).The loading of minute Ag amounts (0.50 wt ) suppressed the H 2 evolution and boosted the CO evolution selectivity to 88.While the CO formation rate initially increased with the increase in the amount of Ag, it stalled in the range of 1.0-3.0wt and slightly decreased for loadings above 4.0 wt .Further, the increase in the Ag loading was accompanied by an increase in the size of the Ag particles (Figure S8).As the Ag cocatalyst effects the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 by H 2 O, the CO formation rate increased over the range of 0.0-1.0wt Ag cocatalyst.However, the increase in the amount of Ag cocatalyst negatively impacted the photocatalytic performance of the material, as the excess amount of Ag aggregated on the surface of the photocatalyst (Figure S8). The photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 by H 2 O over 3.0Ag/ 10Zn/ZnTa 2 O 6 was further investigated by control experiments (Figure 7).Minute H 2 and O 2 amounts were detected in the absence of the photocatalyst or photoirradiation, highlighting their importance to the photocatalytic activity.The absence of the buffer (NaHCO 3 ) or the use of Ar gas instead of CO 2 led to preferential formation of H 2 over 3.0Ag/10Zn/ ZnTa 2 O 6 .When the reaction was conducted under Ar gas flow (instead of CO 2 ), the observed CO evolution stemmed from NaHCO 3 (Figure 7d).Moreover, the role of CO 2 gas as the carbon source of CO generated under the typical reaction conditions was confirmed by the isotopic experiment. 19,20,28n addition to the catalyst's activity, its durability is among the most important factors in the evaluation of the photocatalyst's properties.Figure 8 shows the H 2 , O 2 , and CO formation rates during the 3.0Ag/10Zn/ZnTa 2 O 6 -catalyzed conversion of CO 2 by H 2 O over 15 h.After every 5 h, the photoirradiation was interrupted for 15 h while maintaining the flow of CO 2 .While the CO formation rate decreased much more rapidly during the first run than during the second one (1-5 h and 6-10 h photoirradiation time, respectively), it remained stable during the third run (11-15 h photoirradiation time).A similar trend was observed when the reaction was performed for 15 h without interruption (Figure The Journal of Physical Chemistry C S9).The XRD patterns and the SEM images of 3.0Ag/10Zn/ ZnTa 2 O 6 were recorded before and after the experiment (Figures S10 andS11).While the XRD patterns remained practically unchanged, indicating that the crystalline structure was preserved during the reaction, a significant increase in the Ag nanoparticle size was revealed by the SEM images.Thus, we concluded that Ag nanoparticle aggregation occurred during the photocatalytic reaction. To confirm the effect of the Zn modification on the activity of ZnTa 2 O 6 photocatalysts during the reduction of CO 2 to CO in an aqueous solution, the water splitting activity of the ZnTa 2 O 6 , 10Zn/ZnTa 2 O 6 , 3.0Ag/ZnTa 2 O 6 , and 3.0Ag/10Zn/ ZnTa 2 O 6 photocatalysts was evaluated in deionized water and under a flow of Ar gas.Stoichiometric amounts of H 2 and O 2 were generated over all photocatalysts (Figure 9A).The highest H 2 and O 2 formation rates were observed over the bare ZnTa 2 O 6 , whereas 3.0Ag/10Zn/ZnTa 2 O 6 exhibited the poorest overall water splitting activity.In addition, the water splitting photocatalytic performance of Ag/ZnTa 2 O 6 and 10Zn/ZnTa 2 O 6 were lower than that of ZnTa 2 O 6 .Moreover, Figure 9B allows a direct comparison of the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance of ZnTa 2 O 6 , 10Zn/ZnTa 2 O 6 , 3.0Ag/ZnTa 2 O 6 , and 3.0Ag/10Zn/ZnTa 2 O 6 .Furthermore, additives play an important role in the photocatalytic water splitting 45 and CO 2 reduction reactions. 46The overall catalyst activities were significantly higher when the reaction was conducted in aqueous 0.1 M NaHCO 3 and under CO 2 gas bubbling (Figure 9).In the field of CO 2 photoreduction, the low CO evolution selectivity of bare photocatalysts is generally improved by Ag loading.For example, H 2 was mainly formed over ZnTa 2 O 6 , which exhibited a CO evolution selectivity and CO formation rate of 22.9 and 8.9 mol h -1 , respectively (Figure 9Ba).In comparison, these values were significantly higher for Zn/ZnTa 2 O 6 (71.8, 19.2 mol h -1 ) and Ag/ ZnTa 2 O 6 (63.9, 25.6 mol h -1 ), whereas the H 2 evolution decreased markedly (Figure 9Bb,c).Hence, catalyst modification by Zn and use of Ag as a cocatalyst not only suppress the production of H 2 from H 2 O, which competes with the reduction of CO 2 to CO, but also improve the CO formation rate.Moreover, the H 2 formation rate of 3.0Ag/10Zn/ ZnTa 2 O 6 , which contains both Zn species and Ag cocatalyst, was further decreased.As a result, the highest CO formation rate and CO evolution selectivity were achieved.Interestingly, H 2 generation over the 10Zn/ZnTa 2 O 6 , 3.0Ag/ZnTa 2 O 6 , and 3.0Ag/10Zn/ZnTa 2 O 6 photocatalysts during the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 (typical conditions, Figure 9Bb-d) was nearly the same as under the water splitting conditions (Figure 9Ab-d).Hence, we postulate that the reduction of CO 2 to CO and the production of H 2 occur at distinct active sites on the ZnTa 2 O 6 surface.In contrast, while the CO formation rates of 3.0Ag/10Zn/ZnTa 2 O 6 and 10Ag/ZnTa 2 O 6 were similar, the H 2 formation rate of the former was lower (Figure 9Bc-d).Therefore, CO evolution presumably occurs on the surface of the Ag cocatalyst (active sites of CO generation), whereas the Zn species simply suppresses the formation of H 2 in Ag-containing ZnTa 2 O 6 -based photocatalysts by blocking the active sites in which H 2 evolution occurs.Thus, the overall water splitting activity was suppressed and the CO evolution selectivity of the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 using H 2 O as electron donor was enhanced.Furthermore, the Zn species might be a potential cocatalyst candidate to further improve the CO 2 reduction performance. Schematic depictions of the potential Zn/ZnTa 2 O 6 -based photocatalyst structures and of a plausible reaction mechanism for the Ag/Zn/ZnTa 2 O 6 -photocatalyzed conversion of CO 2 using H 2 O as an electron donor are displayed in Scheme 1. Two Zn/ZnTa 2 O 6 potential structures are proposed based on the experimental data.The first one features modification by The Journal of Physical Chemistry C Zn species exclusively on the ZnTa 2 O 6 surface (Scheme 1a).This is in accordance with the lack of changes in the XRD and XANES data upon Zn modification (see Figures 2 and4), which suggests that the ZnTa 2 O 6 crystal structure remained intact and that Zn modification led to formation of a thin amorphous ZnO or crystalline Zn 3 Ta 2 O 8 layer on the ZnTa 2 O 6 surface.In contrast, the second proposed structure features Zn atoms interstitially doped in the bulk of ZnTa 2 O 6 with a possible Zn concentration gradient (Scheme 1b).This model is in agreement with the shift of the XPS Ta 4f and O 1s peaks to lower binding energies upon Zn modification (see Figure 3), as such shifts are generally regarded as relaxations and reflect changes in the final system state during the measurement. 41,47Hence, they possibly indicate changes in the electronic structure resulting from Zn incorporation.In addition, the slight shift of the adsorption edge in the Zn K-edge XANES spectra of Zn/ZnTa 2 O 6 to lower energy values when the amount of modified Zn increased from 2.5 to 40 suggested that the Zn modification affected the local structure of Zn (Figure 4), 43,44 in a similar fashion as described for the SrFe 1-x Zn x O 3- system. 43Furthermore, Grosvenor and Gaultois suggested that XANES adsorption energy edge shifts are related to changes in the coordination number. 43Hence, the gradual decrease in the adsorption energy edge of the Zn K-edge XANES of Zn/ZnTa 2 O 6 , which correlates with the increase in the amount of Zn modification, is due to a decrease in the Zn coordination number, suggesting the partial incorporation of Zn species into the ZnTa 2 O 6 crystal structure.In this case, the ZnTa 2 O 6 and Zn species function as the solvent and solute, respectively, and the system can be regarded as an interstitial solid solution. 48urther, on the basis of the experimental data presented and discussed herein, a model for the proposed distinct active reaction sites for CO evolution (CO 2 reduction) and H 2 evolution (water splitting) is displayed in Scheme 1c.Upon Zn modification, the H 2 formation rate significantly decreased because the active H 2 evolution sites were blocked, whereas the active CO 2 reduction sites remained largely accessible (Scheme 1d).Hence, in addition to the previously reported activity of Ag in the selective photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 in an aqueous solution, 12 the experimental data obtained in this study demonstrate that the presence of Ag as a cocatalyst also leads to a significant decrease in the H 2 evolution.Finally, the experimental evidence suggests that the Zn species also function as CO 2 reduction cocatalysts, albeit with a lower activity than the Ag cocatalyst."}, {"llm generation": "3.0Ag/10Zn/ZnTa2O6", "source": "The photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 by H 2 O over 3.0Ag/ 10Zn/ZnTa 2 O 6 was further investigated by control experiments (Figure 7).", "context": "Figure 1 shows the formation rate of the photocatalytic products H 2 , O 2 , and CO and the CO evolution selectivity of The Journal of Physical Chemistry C 3.0Ag/ZnTa 2 O 6 modified with different amounts of Zn.The ratio (2R CO 2R H2 )/4R O2 e -/h was 1.In addition, no liquid products, such as HCOOH, HCHO, and CH 3 OH, were detected by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of the reaction solution after the photocatalytic processes.The CO evolution selectivity increased from 64 (Figure 1a) to approximately 90 upon modification with Zn (Figure 1b-g).Moreover, the observed formation of stoichiometric amounts of O 2 suggests that H 2 O serves as an electron donor during the photocatalytic reaction.Furthermore, the CO formation rate of 3.0Ag/5.0Zn/ZnTa2 O 6 and 3.0Ag/10Zn/ZnTa 2 O 6 was excellent (25.6 mol h -1 , Figure 1c-d).However, modification with higher amounts of Zn (above 10) led to a gradual decrease in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity whereas the CO evolution selectivity was stable at 90. To investigate the structural changes resulting from the modification with Zn and their role in the consistently high selectivity for CO formation, the Ag/Zn/ZnTa 2 O 6 catalysts were thoroughly characterized.Figure 2 shows the XRD patterns of the prepared catalysts.Regarding ZnTa 2 O 6 (Figure 2Aa), the observed Pnab (60) space group (ICSD no.36289) was in accordance with previous reports. 19,34Further, most of the XRD peaks of the modified Zn/ZnTa 2 O 6 catalysts were attributed to the ZnTa 2 O 6 phase.The increase in the amount of Zn from 2.5 to 40 mol did not cause the peaks to shift (Figure 2B), indicating that the Zn modification did not influence the crystal structure of ZnTa 2 O 6 .Thus, the Zn ion (0.074 nm) did not dope the ZnTa 2 O 6 (Ta 5 0.062 nm) crystal as predicted by Bragg's Law. 35In contrast, the Zn species covered the surface of ZnTa 2 O 6 .Additionally, the XRD pattern for Zn 3 Ta 2 O 8 was also obtained as a reference.The peaks corresponding to the latter were observed in the patterns of the catalysts modified with at least 20 mol Zn (Figure 2Ae-f).Additionally, the unknown peak at 23.2, which is visible in the patterns of catalysts with over 15 mol Zn, was tentatively assigned to an unknown type of zinc tantalum oxide.Given the poor performance of 3.0Ag/Zn 3 Ta 2 O 8 as a CO 2 conversion photocatalyst (8.2 mol h -1 CO formation rate and 56.4 CO evolution selectivity, Figure S1), we concluded that the lower photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity of catalysts modified with over 15 mol Zn was due to formation of a Zn 3 Ta 2 O 8 layer on the surface of ZnTa 2 O 6 . The UV-vis spectra of the ZnTa 2 O 6 -based catalysts are shown in Figure S2.The absorption edge of ZnTa 2 O 6 was located at approximately 270 nm in accordance with previous reports. 19,34Additionally, the absorption edge wavelengths of the Zn-modified ZnTa 2 O 6 catalysts were similar to that of ZnTa 2 O 6 .Furthermore, the catalysts modified with more than 10 Zn exhibited a broad absorption peak at approximately The Journal of Physical Chemistry C 370 nm (Figure S2c-f), which is similar to that observed in the spectrum of Zn 3 Ta 2 O 8 (Figure S2g).Moreover, the UVvis spectra of 10Zn/ZnTa 2 O 6 and 3.0Ag/10Zn/ZnTa 2 O 6 (Figure S3) feature a broad absorption at a long wavelength, which presumably stems from the plasmonic absorption of the Ag nanoparticles on the surface of the catalysts. 3637738 Further, the SEM images of the various Zn/ZnTa 2 O 6 catalysts revealed that their morphology and microstructure did not change significantly upon modification with Zn (Figure S4). The X-ray photoelectron spectra of Zn 2p and Ta 4f, depicted in Figure 3, were calibrated using the C 1s peak (284.6 eV, Figure S5).The Zn 2p 3/2 and Zn 2p 1/2 peaks of ZnO were observed at 1021.8 and 1045.0 eV, respectively (Figure 3A) and were similarly located in the spectra of ZnTa 2 O 6 , 10Zn/ZnTa 2 O 6 (before and after calcination), Zn 1.1 Ta 2 O 6 , and Zn 3 Ta 2 O 6 .Thus, the Zn species of 10Zn/ ZnTa 2 O 6 are divalent cations (Zn 2 ).In Figure 3B, the peaks of the ZnTa 2 O 6 catalyst located at 26.1 and 27.9 eV were attributed to Ta 4f 7/2 and Ta 4f 5/2 , respectively.The Ta 4f peaks of noncalcinated 10Zn/ZnTa 2 O 6 were detected at similar binding energies as those of ZnTa 2 O 6 .However, the corresponding 10Zn/ZnTa 2 O 6 peaks shifted to slightly lower energy values, whereas those of Zn 3 Ta 2 O 8 underwent a larger shift.Previous reports state that the increase in the average electronegativity of the ligand leads to an increase in the binding energy of the ion. 39,40 ZnTa 2 O 6 .The Zn:Ta ratios of ZnTa 2 O 6 , 10Zn/ZnTa 2 O 6 , 3.0Ag/10Zn/ZnTa 2 O 6 , and Zn 3 Ta 2 O 8 are listed in Table S1.The Zn:Ta ratio of Zn/ZnTa 2 O 6 determined by XPS is significantly higher than that obtained by EDS mapping; therefore, we conclude that most of the modified Zn species exists on the surface of the photocatalyst. 42dditionally, the local structure of the Zn species in the Zn/ ZnTa 2 O 6 catalysts was examined by XAFS measurements.The Zn K-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) data of different zinc compounds, including the reference samples Zn foil, ZnO, ZnTa 2 O 6 , and Zn 3 Ta 2 O 6 , are presented in Figure 4.The Zn K-edge XANES spectra of Zn/ZnTa 2 O 6 were similar to that of ZnTa 2 O 6 , regardless of the amount of modified Zn (2.5-40 mol range).Furthermore, the Ta L IIIedge XANES data of the Zn/ZnTa 2 O 6 catalysts were also consistent with that of ZnTa 2 O 6 (Figure 4B).However, the increase in the amount of modified Zn from 2.5 to 40 mol led to a decrease in the intensity of the Zn K-edge XANES spectra feature peak and in the adsorption edge energy (Figures 4C andD, respectively).Importantly, the adsorption edge energy correlates with the valence state of the detected elements.Hence, the regular shift of the adsorption edge energy of catalysts modified with different amounts of Zn indicates changes in the local structure surrounding the Zn ions. 43,44igure 5 shows the influence of the Ag cocatalyst loading method on the photocatalytic CO 2 conversion performance of 1.5Ag/10Zn/ZnTa 2 O 6 .The catalyst fabricated by the CR and PD methods exhibited similar initial CO formation rates (16.9 mol h -1 ) and CO evolution selectivities (83.0-86.0).In contrast, the initial CO formation rate and CO evolution selectivity of the catalyst prepared by the IMP method were 20.0 mol h -1 and approximately 90, respectively.The SEM images of the differently fabricated 1.5Ag/10Zn/ZnTa 2 O 6 , shown in Figures S6 andS7, reveal that the Ag nanoparticles obtained by the CR and PD methods were large, whereas those resulting from IMP were small and well-dispersed on the ZnTa 2 O 6 surface, as confirmed by the corresponding EDS mapping (Figure S7c).Moreover, several nanoparticles (40-80 nm) appeared on the surface of 10Zn/ZnTa 2 O 6 upon photoirradiation for 5 h (Figures S6a,d).In addition, Figure S6e,f shows a slight increase in the size of the Ag nanoparticles prepared by the CR and PD methods after 5 h of photocatalytic reaction.Importantly, the Ag nanoparticles, which act as cocatalysts, were aggregated on the surface of the ZnTa 2 O 6 and did not interfere with the ZnTa 2 O 6 structure. Figure 6 shows the dependence of the product formation rates on the Ag cocatalyst loading.The CO evolution selectivity of the 10Zn/ZnTa 2 O 6 catalyst (without Ag) was relatively high (71.8).The loading of minute Ag amounts (0.50 wt ) suppressed the H 2 evolution and boosted the CO evolution selectivity to 88.While the CO formation rate initially increased with the increase in the amount of Ag, it stalled in the range of 1.0-3.0wt and slightly decreased for loadings above 4.0 wt .Further, the increase in the Ag loading was accompanied by an increase in the size of the Ag particles (Figure S8).As the Ag cocatalyst effects the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 by H 2 O, the CO formation rate increased over the range of 0.0-1.0wt Ag cocatalyst.However, the increase in the amount of Ag cocatalyst negatively impacted the photocatalytic performance of the material, as the excess amount of Ag aggregated on the surface of the photocatalyst (Figure S8). The photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 by H 2 O over 3.0Ag/ 10Zn/ZnTa 2 O 6 was further investigated by control experiments (Figure 7).Minute H 2 and O 2 amounts were detected in the absence of the photocatalyst or photoirradiation, highlighting their importance to the photocatalytic activity.The absence of the buffer (NaHCO 3 ) or the use of Ar gas instead of CO 2 led to preferential formation of H 2 over 3.0Ag/10Zn/ ZnTa 2 O 6 .When the reaction was conducted under Ar gas flow (instead of CO 2 ), the observed CO evolution stemmed from NaHCO 3 (Figure 7d).Moreover, the role of CO 2 gas as the carbon source of CO generated under the typical reaction conditions was confirmed by the isotopic experiment. 19,20,28n addition to the catalyst's activity, its durability is among the most important factors in the evaluation of the photocatalyst's properties.Figure 8 shows the H 2 , O 2 , and CO formation rates during the 3.0Ag/10Zn/ZnTa 2 O 6 -catalyzed conversion of CO 2 by H 2 O over 15 h.After every 5 h, the photoirradiation was interrupted for 15 h while maintaining the flow of CO 2 .While the CO formation rate decreased much more rapidly during the first run than during the second one (1-5 h and 6-10 h photoirradiation time, respectively), it remained stable during the third run (11-15 h photoirradiation time).A similar trend was observed when the reaction was performed for 15 h without interruption (Figure The Journal of Physical Chemistry C S9).The XRD patterns and the SEM images of 3.0Ag/10Zn/ ZnTa 2 O 6 were recorded before and after the experiment (Figures S10 andS11).While the XRD patterns remained practically unchanged, indicating that the crystalline structure was preserved during the reaction, a significant increase in the Ag nanoparticle size was revealed by the SEM images.Thus, we concluded that Ag nanoparticle aggregation occurred during the photocatalytic reaction. To confirm the effect of the Zn modification on the activity of ZnTa 2 O 6 photocatalysts during the reduction of CO 2 to CO in an aqueous solution, the water splitting activity of the ZnTa 2 O 6 , 10Zn/ZnTa 2 O 6 , 3.0Ag/ZnTa 2 O 6 , and 3.0Ag/10Zn/ ZnTa 2 O 6 photocatalysts was evaluated in deionized water and under a flow of Ar gas.Stoichiometric amounts of H 2 and O 2 were generated over all photocatalysts (Figure 9A).The highest H 2 and O 2 formation rates were observed over the bare ZnTa 2 O 6 , whereas 3.0Ag/10Zn/ZnTa 2 O 6 exhibited the poorest overall water splitting activity.In addition, the water splitting photocatalytic performance of Ag/ZnTa 2 O 6 and 10Zn/ZnTa 2 O 6 were lower than that of ZnTa 2 O 6 .Moreover, Figure 9B allows a direct comparison of the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance of ZnTa 2 O 6 , 10Zn/ZnTa 2 O 6 , 3.0Ag/ZnTa 2 O 6 , and 3.0Ag/10Zn/ZnTa 2 O 6 .Furthermore, additives play an important role in the photocatalytic water splitting 45 and CO 2 reduction reactions. 46The overall catalyst activities were significantly higher when the reaction was conducted in aqueous 0.1 M NaHCO 3 and under CO 2 gas bubbling (Figure 9).In the field of CO 2 photoreduction, the low CO evolution selectivity of bare photocatalysts is generally improved by Ag loading.For example, H 2 was mainly formed over ZnTa 2 O 6 , which exhibited a CO evolution selectivity and CO formation rate of 22.9 and 8.9 mol h -1 , respectively (Figure 9Ba).In comparison, these values were significantly higher for Zn/ZnTa 2 O 6 (71.8, 19.2 mol h -1 ) and Ag/ ZnTa 2 O 6 (63.9, 25.6 mol h -1 ), whereas the H 2 evolution decreased markedly (Figure 9Bb,c).Hence, catalyst modification by Zn and use of Ag as a cocatalyst not only suppress the production of H 2 from H 2 O, which competes with the reduction of CO 2 to CO, but also improve the CO formation rate.Moreover, the H 2 formation rate of 3.0Ag/10Zn/ ZnTa 2 O 6 , which contains both Zn species and Ag cocatalyst, was further decreased.As a result, the highest CO formation rate and CO evolution selectivity were achieved.Interestingly, H 2 generation over the 10Zn/ZnTa 2 O 6 , 3.0Ag/ZnTa 2 O 6 , and 3.0Ag/10Zn/ZnTa 2 O 6 photocatalysts during the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 (typical conditions, Figure 9Bb-d) was nearly the same as under the water splitting conditions (Figure 9Ab-d).Hence, we postulate that the reduction of CO 2 to CO and the production of H 2 occur at distinct active sites on the ZnTa 2 O 6 surface.In contrast, while the CO formation rates of 3.0Ag/10Zn/ZnTa 2 O 6 and 10Ag/ZnTa 2 O 6 were similar, the H 2 formation rate of the former was lower (Figure 9Bc-d).Therefore, CO evolution presumably occurs on the surface of the Ag cocatalyst (active sites of CO generation), whereas the Zn species simply suppresses the formation of H 2 in Ag-containing ZnTa 2 O 6 -based photocatalysts by blocking the active sites in which H 2 evolution occurs.Thus, the overall water splitting activity was suppressed and the CO evolution selectivity of the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 using H 2 O as electron donor was enhanced.Furthermore, the Zn species might be a potential cocatalyst candidate to further improve the CO 2 reduction performance. Schematic depictions of the potential Zn/ZnTa 2 O 6 -based photocatalyst structures and of a plausible reaction mechanism for the Ag/Zn/ZnTa 2 O 6 -photocatalyzed conversion of CO 2 using H 2 O as an electron donor are displayed in Scheme 1. Two Zn/ZnTa 2 O 6 potential structures are proposed based on the experimental data.The first one features modification by The Journal of Physical Chemistry C Zn species exclusively on the ZnTa 2 O 6 surface (Scheme 1a).This is in accordance with the lack of changes in the XRD and XANES data upon Zn modification (see Figures 2 and4), which suggests that the ZnTa 2 O 6 crystal structure remained intact and that Zn modification led to formation of a thin amorphous ZnO or crystalline Zn 3 Ta 2 O 8 layer on the ZnTa 2 O 6 surface.In contrast, the second proposed structure features Zn atoms interstitially doped in the bulk of ZnTa 2 O 6 with a possible Zn concentration gradient (Scheme 1b).This model is in agreement with the shift of the XPS Ta 4f and O 1s peaks to lower binding energies upon Zn modification (see Figure 3), as such shifts are generally regarded as relaxations and reflect changes in the final system state during the measurement. 41,47Hence, they possibly indicate changes in the electronic structure resulting from Zn incorporation.In addition, the slight shift of the adsorption edge in the Zn K-edge XANES spectra of Zn/ZnTa 2 O 6 to lower energy values when the amount of modified Zn increased from 2.5 to 40 suggested that the Zn modification affected the local structure of Zn (Figure 4), 43,44 in a similar fashion as described for the SrFe 1-x Zn x O 3- system. 43Furthermore, Grosvenor and Gaultois suggested that XANES adsorption energy edge shifts are related to changes in the coordination number. 43Hence, the gradual decrease in the adsorption energy edge of the Zn K-edge XANES of Zn/ZnTa 2 O 6 , which correlates with the increase in the amount of Zn modification, is due to a decrease in the Zn coordination number, suggesting the partial incorporation of Zn species into the ZnTa 2 O 6 crystal structure.In this case, the ZnTa 2 O 6 and Zn species function as the solvent and solute, respectively, and the system can be regarded as an interstitial solid solution. 48urther, on the basis of the experimental data presented and discussed herein, a model for the proposed distinct active reaction sites for CO evolution (CO 2 reduction) and H 2 evolution (water splitting) is displayed in Scheme 1c.Upon Zn modification, the H 2 formation rate significantly decreased because the active H 2 evolution sites were blocked, whereas the active CO 2 reduction sites remained largely accessible (Scheme 1d).Hence, in addition to the previously reported activity of Ag in the selective photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 in an aqueous solution, 12 the experimental data obtained in this study demonstrate that the presence of Ag as a cocatalyst also leads to a significant decrease in the H 2 evolution.Finally, the experimental evidence suggests that the Zn species also function as CO 2 reduction cocatalysts, albeit with a lower activity than the Ag cocatalyst."}, {"llm generation": "ZnTa 2 O 6", "source": "In the case of low Zn concentration, the modification consists of a thin layer of amorphous ZnO or incorporation of Zn atoms as interstitial dopant into the bulk of the ZnTa 2 O 6 photocatalyst.", "context": "The modification of the ZnTa 2 O 6 surface by Zn species significantly improved the CO evolution selectivity in the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 using H 2 O as an electron donor.In the case of low Zn concentration, the modification consists of a thin layer of amorphous ZnO or incorporation of Zn atoms as interstitial dopant into the bulk of the ZnTa 2 O 6 photocatalyst.We speculated that the surface of ZnTa 2 O 6 features separate active sites for H 2 and CO evolution.In addition, the modified Zn species introduced on the surface of Zn/ZnTa 2 O 6 influence the H 2 evolution sites.In the modified catalysts, the Zn species suppresses the evolution of H 2 , enhancing the CO evolution selectivity, and as well contributes to the CO formation.Therefore, the Zn species is likely a novel cocatalyst, in addition to the previously known Ag nanoparticle-based cocatalysts.A reasonable structure model and the role of the modified Zn should be addressed in future studies. s Supporting Information The Supporting Information is available free of charge at https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c08464.
