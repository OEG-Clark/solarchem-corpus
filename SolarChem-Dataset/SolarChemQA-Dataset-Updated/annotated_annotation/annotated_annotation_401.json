The ZIF-9 was prepared via a solvothermal method 31 and was characterized with XRD (Fig. S4), FTIR (Fig. S5), SEM (Fig. S6), TEM (Fig. S7) and CO 2 adsorption (Fig. 3(b)).The powder XRD (Fig. S4) showed that ZIF-9 crystal structure coincided well with previous report 31.The FTIR (Fig. S5) spectrum further confirmed the successful formation of ZIF-9.The ZIF-9 is composed of cobalt ions coordinated by nitrogen atoms in benzimidazolate linkers forming a tetrahedral CoN 4 building unit 31 (Fig. 3(a)).Obviously, the ZIF-9 has both Co 2 and imidazolate-based functionalities.ZIF-9 has a high CO 2 uptake ability, approaching 2.68 mmol/g (Fig. 3(b)).The isotherm shows an important hysteresis during CO 2 uptake, corresponding to a common feature of flexible frameworks.For the construction of the basic artificial photosynthetic unit, 1 wt Au NPs was firstly loaded onto CNS (Fig. S7), then ZIF-9 were assembled onto Au-CNS via thermal treatment (Fig. S8).After that, the catalysts were treated at 200 C under vacuum for 12 h. Artificial photosynthesis is operated on polymeric g-C 3 N 4 based systems with water and carbon dioxide as the reactants.Bare CNS evolved negligible fuel molecules.To overcome the thermochemically unfavorable one-electron reduction of CO 2 , the proton-coupled electron transfer should be promoted by surface modifications (e.g., co-catalysts) 32.After deposition 1 wt Au NPs, Au-CNS system evolved H 2 , and CO as the main products, while H 2 is still the dominating one (Fig. 4(a,b)).The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction has two main (oxidation and reduction) processes.During the oxidation process, H 2 O is oxidized by the holes to produce H In the reduction process, some main reactions proceed to reduce CO 2 to CH 4 (CO 33.E CB of g-C 3 N 4 is reported to be A1.3V vs NHE (pH14 7) and is sufficient for water reduction to generate H 2 14, while E VB at about 1.4 V is able for water oxidation (Fig. 1 (e)).Absorption edge of CNS show a slight blue shift compared with the bulk g-C 3 N 4 (Fig. 3(c)), and the band gap increased to 2.9 eV, which is due to the quantum confinement effect by shifting the conduction and valence band edges in opposite directions 34.E VB of CNS is more positive than that of E( , and E CB is more negative than that of E(CO 2 /CO) (CO 2 2e A 2H -COH 2 O, Er edox14 A0.53 V vs NHE).So the photo-generated electrons and holes react with CO 2 and H 2 O to generate CO.In our photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction, H 2 was indeed detected as the byproduct of the reaction.In the meanwhile, the two electron reduction of CO 2 by H 2 to give CO and H 2 O (CO 2 H 2 -CO H 2 O) might occur simultaneously 35,36.Other hydrocarbon fuels (e.g.HCOOH, CH 3 OH, etc) were failed to be detected.This is probably because for the gas-phase photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with low proton concentrations, CO is the primary first step product instead of HCOOH 37,38.What\"s more, the holes (or OH radicals) with strong oxidation ability react with intermediates and products produced via CO 2 conversion reactions, 39 resulted the net yield negligible. Notably, after combining ZIF-9, the activity of the systems increased significantly.Au-CNS-ZIF-9 (1 wt) exhibit about 6.6 and 122 fold improvement for H 2 and CO evolution respectively as compared to the non-ZIF-9 modified systems (Figs.4(a) and(b)).This is because of multiple processes mainly including electron transfer and CO 2 activation.ZIF-9 has functionalities of both Co 2 and imidazolate.Transition-metal ions such as Co 2 can efficiently transfer the excited electrons for redox reaction 40.We did comparative experiments (Fig. S9).When only Co (II) ions was mixed into the catalyst, the activity was increased compared with Au-CNS which demonstrate that the introduced transition metal ions could boost the catalytic activity by serving as electron mediator.In the meanwhile, imidazolate-based organic ligands such as ionic liquids 41 have been demonstrated to not only have high CO 2 adsorptive capabilities but also have a stabilizing effect on the CO 2 by complexation 42.The stabilizing effect of the imidazolium motifs on CO 2 greatly reduces the overall barrier to CO 2 reduction 43.We also did comparative experiments by using 1 benzimidazole doped CNS (Fig. S9).When organic ligands were added into the systems, the activity was also increased compared with Au-CNS reference, which demonstrated that the organic ligands also contributed to the activity enhancement by serving as CO 2 activator.Furthermore, cobalt ions with suitable organic ligands have been used for the reductive catalysis of CO 2 and H 44.Therefore, in our work, ZIF-9 which has both Co 2 and imidazolate-based functionalities serves as an electron mediator as well as CO 2 activator, which greatly boosted the CO evolution yield compared with the Au-CNS sample.To elucidate that ZIF-9 can facilitate charge separation, photoluminescence (PL) measurements were further carried out (Fig. 3 (d)).In the photoluminescence spectrum of Au-C 3 N 4 -ZIF-9 series, Au-CNS has an emission peak around 450 nm.With different concentrations of ZIF-9, weaker emission peaks in the same position were detected, suggesting that the addition of ZIF-9 significantly inhibits the recombination of electron-hole pairs.Au-CNS-ZIF-9 (1) has relative lower emission peak, suggesting the suppressing the recombination of electron-hole pairs, which agrees strongly with the photocatalytic performance.Increased concentrations of ZIF-9 (2, 5) result in stronger PL peaks, which coincide strongly with the photocatalytic activity.However, when the concentration of ZIF-9 was up to 20, the emission peak was even lower than that of ZIF-9 (1), this might because of the high contents of ZIF-9 which itself has no emission as shown in Fig. 3(d).The photoluminescence spectra results also indicate that after the impregnation and calcination treatments, the ZIF-9 could be anchored on the CNS and has close linkage with CNS.The - interaction between the benzimidazole ring and the electron-rich, layered configurations of g-C 3 N 4 contributes to the \"linkage\" of the ZIF-9 onto the g-C 3 N 4 , which facilitates the interaction with each other.Thanks to the close linkage (or interaction), the photoluminescence of the composites decreased, which could be ascribed to the efficient fluorescence quenching effect due to the charge transport from excited g-C 3 N 4 to ZIF-9.On the other hand, as ZIF-9 has high CO 2 uptake ability, so the entire system has higher CO 2 adsorption activity (Fig. S10).At the same time, we found that ZIF-9 may serve as a cocatalyst for O 2 evolution (Fig. S11).Bare CNS evolved negligible O 2 using AgNO 3 as an electron acceptor.However, CNS-ZIF-9 (1 wt) evolved about 22 mmol/h/g O 2 under the same measurement conditions (Fig. S11), which indicates ZIF-9 can trap holes, hence inhibiting the recombination of electrons and holes, but more details need to be investigated further.The electrochemical behavior of ZIF-9 was investigated using a standard three-electrode system in 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer (pH14 7.0) (Fig. S12).The cyclic voltammetry (CV) scans demonstrated that ZIF-9 has greater current density and earlier onset of catalytic current density as compared to its background glassy carbon.The onset of the catalytic current (1.6 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE) occurs 0.4 V beyond the thermodynamic potential for water oxidation (1.23 V vs. RHE).This suggested that ZIF-9 is an oxygen-evolution electrocatalyst. For comparison, pure ZIF-9 showed no activity for H 2 or hydrocarbon fuels generation (Fig. 4(c)), which demonstrates it has no water splitting and CO 2 photoreduction ability.This proved that the photoreaction was driven by the light excitation of CNS for the photoredox catalysis reactions.On the other hand, the activity did not increase with the increased loading of ZIF-9.Loading of 1 wt ZIF-9 showed the optimum activity (Fig. 4(c)).This is consistent with PL results, which reveals that electron transfer process is the dominant one while CO 2 adsorption is interestingly only a minor factor.After irradiation, the ZIF-9 was stable demonstrated with CO 2 adsorption measurements (Fig. S13) and XPS spectrum (Fig. S14).Furthermore, the CO evolution activity of CNS based composites is much higher than bulk-CN based ones (Fig. 4(b)), which should be attributed to its planar configuration and high surface areas. As for the amount of CO produced, it increased almost linearly as shown in Fig. 4(b) with the amount of Au-CNS-ZIF-9 to be 50 mg.The CO generation rate using 50 mg photocatalyst was calculated to be 7.66 mmol h A 1 g A 1 (Fig. 4(c)).The reaction rates cannot be accurately compared which depend on photocatalyst quantity, irradiation conditions (e.g.light intensity), preserve of sacrificial agents and so forth.The deactivation might occur because the metal surfaces become poisoned and deactivated by the reduction products 45 and the adsorption of the intermediate products onto the photocatalyst surface to block the active sites 46.Furthermore, no oxygen was detected.Oxygen evolution is much more difficult than H 2 generation.The O 2 generated could be partially used to oxide the produced intermediates 47. Furthermore, O 2 is easy to absorb on the oxygen vacancies 48 and absorbs electrons to form O A 2 or other species (e.g A H 2 O 2 ) that chemisorbs on the photocatalysts surfaces.This makes the necessary overvoltage larger 49, thus further inhibit O 2 production. Finally, control experiments were carried out to confirm that the CO fuel was produced from the photoreduction of CO 2 (Fig. 4 (d)).When under the conditions of without H 2 O, photocatalyst or light, no CO evolved.When using Ar gas instead of CO 2 gas, only traces of CO was detected due to the reduction of the remaining adsorbed CO 2 on the catalyst surface 50.Therefore, the above reference data demonstrate that the H 2 O provides protons, CO 2 serves as carbon source, and the photocatalyst gives the redox potentials for the whole reaction to produce CO.Furthermore, to confirm the source of CO, an isotopic experiment using 13 CO 2 with the same conditions was carried out.The evolved CO was analyzed by gas chromatography mass (GC-MS, Shimadzu, QP-2010-Ultra).After 12 h irradiation, we observed a peak at m/z 29 (Fig. S15).This could be assigned to 13 CO.To remove the unreacted CO 2 in the mixture before injection into GC-MS, we flew the gases through NaOH solutions, the residue was detected by GC-MS again.However, the peak at m/z 29 was not detected.This might because of the loss of 13 CO after a series of treatment (e.g.dissolution in the NaOH solution or leakage), and the low content is below the detection limit of GC-MS."}, {"llm generation": "polymeric g-C 3 N 4", "source": "With this proof-of-concept in mind, we have demonstrated a biomimetic strategy for constructing a promising nanoarchitectured artificial photosynthetic unit by interfacing a triple junction, polymeric g-C 3 N 4 as an active water splitting and CO 2 reduction photocatalyst, Au NPs as a cocatalyst, ZIF-9 as an electron mediator as well as CO 2 activator to convert solar energy into fuels from water and CO 2 .", "context": "In photosynthesis, an elaborated system is constructed by connecting a light-harvesting antenna network, a molecular water oxidation center, and CO 2 or proton-reduction biomachinery in a nanolayered architecture and further into 3D hierarchical architectures to convert solar energy into chemical energy as carbohydrates or \"hydrogen\".

The ZIF-9 was prepared via a solvothermal method 31 and was characterized with XRD (Fig. S4), FTIR (Fig. S5), SEM (Fig. S6), TEM (Fig. S7) and CO 2 adsorption (Fig. 3(b)).The powder XRD (Fig. S4) showed that ZIF-9 crystal structure coincided well with previous report 31.The FTIR (Fig. S5) spectrum further confirmed the successful formation of ZIF-9.The ZIF-9 is composed of cobalt ions coordinated by nitrogen atoms in benzimidazolate linkers forming a tetrahedral CoN 4 building unit 31 (Fig. 3(a)).Obviously, the ZIF-9 has both Co 2 and imidazolate-based functionalities.ZIF-9 has a high CO 2 uptake ability, approaching 2.68 mmol/g (Fig. 3(b)).The isotherm shows an important hysteresis during CO 2 uptake, corresponding to a common feature of flexible frameworks.For the construction of the basic artificial photosynthetic unit, 1 wt Au NPs was firstly loaded onto CNS (Fig. S7), then ZIF-9 were assembled onto Au-CNS via thermal treatment (Fig. S8).After that, the catalysts were treated at 200 C under vacuum for 12 h. Artificial photosynthesis is operated on polymeric g-C 3 N 4 based systems with water and carbon dioxide as the reactants.Bare CNS evolved negligible fuel molecules.To overcome the thermochemically unfavorable one-electron reduction of CO 2 , the proton-coupled electron transfer should be promoted by surface modifications (e.g., co-catalysts) 32.After deposition 1 wt Au NPs, Au-CNS system evolved H 2 , and CO as the main products, while H 2 is still the dominating one (Fig. 4(a,b)).The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction has two main (oxidation and reduction) processes.During the oxidation process, H 2 O is oxidized by the holes to produce H In the reduction process, some main reactions proceed to reduce CO 2 to CH 4 (CO 33.E CB of g-C 3 N 4 is reported to be A1.3V vs NHE (pH14 7) and is sufficient for water reduction to generate H 2 14, while E VB at about 1.4 V is able for water oxidation (Fig. 1 (e)).Absorption edge of CNS show a slight blue shift compared with the bulk g-C 3 N 4 (Fig. 3(c)), and the band gap increased to 2.9 eV, which is due to the quantum confinement effect by shifting the conduction and valence band edges in opposite directions 34.E VB of CNS is more positive than that of E( , and E CB is more negative than that of E(CO 2 /CO) (CO 2 2e A 2H -COH 2 O, Er edox14 A0.53 V vs NHE).So the photo-generated electrons and holes react with CO 2 and H 2 O to generate CO.In our photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction, H 2 was indeed detected as the byproduct of the reaction.In the meanwhile, the two electron reduction of CO 2 by H 2 to give CO and H 2 O (CO 2 H 2 -CO H 2 O) might occur simultaneously 35,36.Other hydrocarbon fuels (e.g.HCOOH, CH 3 OH, etc) were failed to be detected.This is probably because for the gas-phase photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with low proton concentrations, CO is the primary first step product instead of HCOOH 37,38.What\"s more, the holes (or OH radicals) with strong oxidation ability react with intermediates and products produced via CO 2 conversion reactions, 39 resulted the net yield negligible. Notably, after combining ZIF-9, the activity of the systems increased significantly.Au-CNS-ZIF-9 (1 wt) exhibit about 6.6 and 122 fold improvement for H 2 and CO evolution respectively as compared to the non-ZIF-9 modified systems (Figs.4(a) and(b)).This is because of multiple processes mainly including electron transfer and CO 2 activation.ZIF-9 has functionalities of both Co 2 and imidazolate.Transition-metal ions such as Co 2 can efficiently transfer the excited electrons for redox reaction 40.We did comparative experiments (Fig. S9).When only Co (II) ions was mixed into the catalyst, the activity was increased compared with Au-CNS which demonstrate that the introduced transition metal ions could boost the catalytic activity by serving as electron mediator.In the meanwhile, imidazolate-based organic ligands such as ionic liquids 41 have been demonstrated to not only have high CO 2 adsorptive capabilities but also have a stabilizing effect on the CO 2 by complexation 42.The stabilizing effect of the imidazolium motifs on CO 2 greatly reduces the overall barrier to CO 2 reduction 43.We also did comparative experiments by using 1 benzimidazole doped CNS (Fig. S9).When organic ligands were added into the systems, the activity was also increased compared with Au-CNS reference, which demonstrated that the organic ligands also contributed to the activity enhancement by serving as CO 2 activator.Furthermore, cobalt ions with suitable organic ligands have been used for the reductive catalysis of CO 2 and H 44.Therefore, in our work, ZIF-9 which has both Co 2 and imidazolate-based functionalities serves as an electron mediator as well as CO 2 activator, which greatly boosted the CO evolution yield compared with the Au-CNS sample.To elucidate that ZIF-9 can facilitate charge separation, photoluminescence (PL) measurements were further carried out (Fig. 3 (d)).In the photoluminescence spectrum of Au-C 3 N 4 -ZIF-9 series, Au-CNS has an emission peak around 450 nm.With different concentrations of ZIF-9, weaker emission peaks in the same position were detected, suggesting that the addition of ZIF-9 significantly inhibits the recombination of electron-hole pairs.Au-CNS-ZIF-9 (1) has relative lower emission peak, suggesting the suppressing the recombination of electron-hole pairs, which agrees strongly with the photocatalytic performance.Increased concentrations of ZIF-9 (2, 5) result in stronger PL peaks, which coincide strongly with the photocatalytic activity.However, when the concentration of ZIF-9 was up to 20, the emission peak was even lower than that of ZIF-9 (1), this might because of the high contents of ZIF-9 which itself has no emission as shown in Fig. 3(d).The photoluminescence spectra results also indicate that after the impregnation and calcination treatments, the ZIF-9 could be anchored on the CNS and has close linkage with CNS.The - interaction between the benzimidazole ring and the electron-rich, layered configurations of g-C 3 N 4 contributes to the \"linkage\" of the ZIF-9 onto the g-C 3 N 4 , which facilitates the interaction with each other.Thanks to the close linkage (or interaction), the photoluminescence of the composites decreased, which could be ascribed to the efficient fluorescence quenching effect due to the charge transport from excited g-C 3 N 4 to ZIF-9.On the other hand, as ZIF-9 has high CO 2 uptake ability, so the entire system has higher CO 2 adsorption activity (Fig. S10).At the same time, we found that ZIF-9 may serve as a cocatalyst for O 2 evolution (Fig. S11).Bare CNS evolved negligible O 2 using AgNO 3 as an electron acceptor.However, CNS-ZIF-9 (1 wt) evolved about 22 mmol/h/g O 2 under the same measurement conditions (Fig. S11), which indicates ZIF-9 can trap holes, hence inhibiting the recombination of electrons and holes, but more details need to be investigated further.The electrochemical behavior of ZIF-9 was investigated using a standard three-electrode system in 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer (pH14 7.0) (Fig. S12).The cyclic voltammetry (CV) scans demonstrated that ZIF-9 has greater current density and earlier onset of catalytic current density as compared to its background glassy carbon.The onset of the catalytic current (1.6 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE) occurs 0.4 V beyond the thermodynamic potential for water oxidation (1.23 V vs. RHE).This suggested that ZIF-9 is an oxygen-evolution electrocatalyst. For comparison, pure ZIF-9 showed no activity for H 2 or hydrocarbon fuels generation (Fig. 4(c)), which demonstrates it has no water splitting and CO 2 photoreduction ability.This proved that the photoreaction was driven by the light excitation of CNS for the photoredox catalysis reactions.On the other hand, the activity did not increase with the increased loading of ZIF-9.Loading of 1 wt ZIF-9 showed the optimum activity (Fig. 4(c)).This is consistent with PL results, which reveals that electron transfer process is the dominant one while CO 2 adsorption is interestingly only a minor factor.After irradiation, the ZIF-9 was stable demonstrated with CO 2 adsorption measurements (Fig. S13) and XPS spectrum (Fig. S14).Furthermore, the CO evolution activity of CNS based composites is much higher than bulk-CN based ones (Fig. 4(b)), which should be attributed to its planar configuration and high surface areas. As for the amount of CO produced, it increased almost linearly as shown in Fig. 4(b) with the amount of Au-CNS-ZIF-9 to be 50 mg.The CO generation rate using 50 mg photocatalyst was calculated to be 7.66 mmol h A 1 g A 1 (Fig. 4(c)).The reaction rates cannot be accurately compared which depend on photocatalyst quantity, irradiation conditions (e.g.light intensity), preserve of sacrificial agents and so forth.The deactivation might occur because the metal surfaces become poisoned and deactivated by the reduction products 45 and the adsorption of the intermediate products onto the photocatalyst surface to block the active sites 46.Furthermore, no oxygen was detected.Oxygen evolution is much more difficult than H 2 generation.The O 2 generated could be partially used to oxide the produced intermediates 47. Furthermore, O 2 is easy to absorb on the oxygen vacancies 48 and absorbs electrons to form O A 2 or other species (e.g A H 2 O 2 ) that chemisorbs on the photocatalysts surfaces.This makes the necessary overvoltage larger 49, thus further inhibit O 2 production. Finally, control experiments were carried out to confirm that the CO fuel was produced from the photoreduction of CO 2 (Fig. 4 (d)).When under the conditions of without H 2 O, photocatalyst or light, no CO evolved.When using Ar gas instead of CO 2 gas, only traces of CO was detected due to the reduction of the remaining adsorbed CO 2 on the catalyst surface 50.Therefore, the above reference data demonstrate that the H 2 O provides protons, CO 2 serves as carbon source, and the photocatalyst gives the redox potentials for the whole reaction to produce CO.Furthermore, to confirm the source of CO, an isotopic experiment using 13 CO 2 with the same conditions was carried out.The evolved CO was analyzed by gas chromatography mass (GC-MS, Shimadzu, QP-2010-Ultra).After 12 h irradiation, we observed a peak at m/z 29 (Fig. S15).This could be assigned to 13 CO.To remove the unreacted CO 2 in the mixture before injection into GC-MS, we flew the gases through NaOH solutions, the residue was detected by GC-MS again.However, the peak at m/z 29 was not detected.This might because of the loss of 13 CO after a series of treatment (e.g.dissolution in the NaOH solution or leakage), and the low content is below the detection limit of GC-MS."}], "reactor type": [], "operation mode": [{"llm generation": "Batch", "source": "The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction were measured in a gas closed system under constant gas circulation (Fig. S1), the total volume of which is about 390 ml.", "context": "Firstly, C 3 N 4 nanosheets were first synthesized via a thermal oxidation etching process according to a procedure described previously.Typically, dicyandiamide was calcined at 550 C for 4 h at Ar atmosphere.The bulk C 3 N 4 powder was dispersed in a crucible and heated at 500 C for 2 h.g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets with light yellow appearance was obtained with 6 yield.Then protonation process was undertaken by stirring g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets with hydrochloric acid (37) for 3 h at room temperature, centrifugal washing with water until neutral condition and drying at 105 C in air overnight.Au-CNS was prepared by stirring CNS, 1 wt HAuCl 4 A 3H 2 O and water in dark for 48 h, centrifugal washing until the upper decanted solution became colorless, reducing by excess NaBH 4 and drying at 105 C in air overnight.Mesoporous TiO 2 with a surface area of about 300 m 2 g A 1 was synthesized via a sol-gel process.
