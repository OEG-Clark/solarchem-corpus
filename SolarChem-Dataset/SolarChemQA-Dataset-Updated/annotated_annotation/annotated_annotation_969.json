Briefly, 8.92 g of zinc nitrate hexahydrate (0.03 mol) and 3.46 g of citric acid (0.018 mol) were dissolved in 40 ml of DI water under constant stirring.The precursor solution was then nebulized by a Collison nebulizer (BGI Incorporated); the droplets were carried by a 12 psi nitrogen flow through a diffusion dryer, and then a heating tubular furnace reactor in which the temperature was variously controlled at 500, 550, 600, or 650 C.The products were collected downstream of the reactor on a glass-fiber filter.The obtained samples were denoted OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -X, where X corresponds to the furnace temperature.With the same experimental setup, OD-ZnO/C-Air was also prepared with a fixed citric acid/zinc nitrate molar ratio of 0.6, and 12 psi compressed air was used as the carrier gas. The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 was conducted at ambient temperature in a lab-built continuous gas flow reactor.Compressed CO 2 (99.999,Praxair) was the carbon source, and was passed through a water bubbler to generate a mixture of CO 2 and water vapor.The gaseous mixture was then introduced into a homemade continuous flow reactor where the photocatalyst samples were loaded.A 400 W Xenon lamp (Oriel 66021, Newport Co.) equipped with various cut-off filters to provide radiation in different wavelength regions, including UV-Vis-NIR (250-950 nm), Vis-NIR (400-950 nm), and NIR (715-950 nm).The light intensity was measured by a spectroradiometer (ILT-900R, International Light Technologies).The photoreduction analysis system and light spectra with different cut-off filters were detailed in our previous publication 27. Before each test, the reactor loaded with samples and support glass fiber was initially purged with CO 2 and water vapor at 16 ml/min for 1 h, and then the flow rate was decreased and maintained at 3 ml/min for the test period.The light source was turned on (t 0 h) and measurements were made for 8 h.The concentrations of effluent gases (CO 2 , CO, CH 4 , O 2 , and N 2 ) as a function of irradiation time were recorded automatically by gas chromatography (GC, 6895 N, Agilent Technologies, Inc.) through an automated gas valve, using helium as the carrier gas.The GC was equipped with a PLOT capillary column (Supelco Carboxen-1010) and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD).To minimize potential errors, for each catalyst, experiments were repeated three times using fresh catalysts, and the production rates were averaged, and standard deviations were calculated. The morphology of the material and its elemental distribution of zinc, oxygen, and carbon were characterized by highresolution trasmission electron microscopy (TEM) -energydispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) (HR-TEM, JEOL J2100F) mapping technique.An X-ray Diffraction (XRD) instrument (D8 Advance, Bruker, USA) with Cu Ka radiation (k 1.548A) was used to determine the crystal phase.The specific surface area (S BET ), and pore diameter of the materials were measured using a surface area and pore diameter distribution analyzer (Micromeritics, ASAP 2020, USA).The S BET was calculated using the Brunauer-Emmet t-Teller (BET) method, and the pore size distribution was evaluated by non-local density functional theory (NLDFT).CO 2 adsorp-tion isotherms were measured using the same Micrometrics ASAP2020 equipment.All samples were degassed at 423 K overnight and sealed under vacuum prior to analysis.CO 2 was adsorbed at 298 K, and the pressure ranged from 10 to 760 mm Hg. The surface chemical properties were analyzed by laser Raman spectrometry (Renishaw InVia Reflex confocal Raman spectrometer, with a 514 nm laser) and XPS instrument (PHI 5000 VersaProbe II), equipped with a monochromatic Al Ka (1486.6 eV) X-ray source.Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of all the samples were recorded via a Nicolet is50 FTIR spectrometer.The thermal behavior of the as-synthesized materials was analyzed by thermal gravimetric and differential thermal analyses (TGA/DTA) (TA Instruments, New Castle, DE).A UV-Vis spectrophotometer (UV-2600, Shimadzu, USA) was used to obtain the optical properties of the materials. The fluorescence spectra of the materials were recorded using a Vis-NIR spectrofluorometer (Horiba Jobin Yvon Inc).The fluorescence lifetime was measured using the time-correlated singlephoton counting (TCSPC) method on a Fluorolog (Horiba) equipped with a PMT928P detector and an imaging spectrometer (iH320).DataStationO v2.2 (Horiba) was used for data acquisition.Lifetime measurements were conducted with 300 nm excitation from a NanoLED light source at a 1 MHz frequency and slit width of 8 nm.The valence band and conduction band positions were determined by ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS), with a Physical Electronics 5000 VersaProbe II Scanning ESCA Microprobe.An He I (21.2 eV) ultraviolet source was used, and a 5 V bias was applied to the sample to observe a clear secondary electron edge.The samples were prepared on Si wafer coated with an 15 nm thick gold film. Photoelectrochemical measurements were performed in a three-electrode cell setup.A Pt wire and Ag/AgCl bar were used as the counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively.For the working electrode, 5 mg of the material powder was dispersed in 0.75 ml of DI water, followed by the addition of 20 ll of Nafion solution (0.05, Sigma-Aldrich).After ultrasonication for 30 min, the above suspension was dropped onto the surface of an indium tin oxide (ITO) conductor glass slide.The working electrode was then dried at 60 C.The photocurrent was measured using a CHI 760 Bipotentiostat in 0.1 M Na 2 SO 4 solution 2.4.In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) In situ DRIFT experiments (Figure S2) were performed on a Nicolet is50 spectrometer equipped with a Harrick Scientific DRIFT cell and a mercury-cadmium-telluride (MCT) detector cooled by liquid N 2 .DRIFT spectra were collected in the range of 3800-1200 cm A1 , accumulating 64 scans at 4 cm A1 resolution in the Kubelka A Munk format.Prior to each test, all samples were held at 100 C under helium flow (30 ml/min) for 0.5 h, and then cooled to 60 C to get a background IR spectrum to be subtracted from the sample spectra for each measurement.The helium flow was immediately stopped, and CO 2 /H 2 O mixture was introduced into the chamber with a flow rate of 4 ml/min for 60 min in the dark when the intensities of adsorption peaks reached saturation.Next, the light source was turned on for 60 min to monitor the adsorbed intermediates during the photoreduction reactions."}, {"llm generation": "OD-ZnO/carbon dot heterostructures", "source": "In summary, for enhanced CO 2 photoreduction, full-spectrumactivated OD-ZnO/carbon dot heterostructures were rationally engineered by the FuAR method.", "context": "In summary, for enhanced CO 2 photoreduction, full-spectrumactivated OD-ZnO/carbon dot heterostructures were rationally engineered by the FuAR method.As illustrated by the DRIFT spectra, the defect-rich surface of OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -600 contributes to the efficient activation of CO 2 /H 2 O molecules.Moreover, the PL results provide solid evidence for the presence of a new intermediate band in OD-ZnO and of UCPL associated with the carbon dots, both of which increase light utilization efficiency.Thanks to synergistically enhanced CO 2 /H 2 O activation and increased light utilization efficiency, OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -600 showed high CO formation activity.Under UV-Vis-NIR, Vis-NIR and NIR light separately supplied, the surface adsorbed carbon intermediates were effectively transformed into CO, as evidenced by the DRIFT results.Plausible path-ways for the CO 2 photoreduction were proposed.The outcomes of this work are new insights into CO 2 activation, the interface structure, and charge transfer on defective semiconductor/carbon dot heterostructures.They also advance our fundamental knowledge of the rational design of other semiconductor/carbon dot hybrids for CO 2 photoreduction and other photocatalytic applications.

study 27.In preliminary studies, we demonstrated the influence of the concentration of zinc nitrate on the catalytic activity of the synthesized OD-ZnO/C for the CO 2 photoreduction.When the concentration of zinc nitrate was 0.75 M, the resulting OD-ZnO/C showed the highest photocatalytic activity (Figure S1).Thus, the concentration of zinc nitrate was kept at 0.75 M in this work. Briefly, 8.92 g of zinc nitrate hexahydrate (0.03 mol) and 3.46 g of citric acid (0.018 mol) were dissolved in 40 ml of DI water under constant stirring.The precursor solution was then nebulized by a Collison nebulizer (BGI Incorporated); the droplets were carried by a 12 psi nitrogen flow through a diffusion dryer, and then a heating tubular furnace reactor in which the temperature was variously controlled at 500, 550, 600, or 650 C.The products were collected downstream of the reactor on a glass-fiber filter.The obtained samples were denoted OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -X, where X corresponds to the furnace temperature.With the same experimental setup, OD-ZnO/C-Air was also prepared with a fixed citric acid/zinc nitrate molar ratio of 0.6, and 12 psi compressed air was used as the carrier gas. The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 was conducted at ambient temperature in a lab-built continuous gas flow reactor.Compressed CO 2 (99.999,Praxair) was the carbon source, and was passed through a water bubbler to generate a mixture of CO 2 and water vapor.The gaseous mixture was then introduced into a homemade continuous flow reactor where the photocatalyst samples were loaded.A 400 W Xenon lamp (Oriel 66021, Newport Co.) equipped with various cut-off filters to provide radiation in different wavelength regions, including UV-Vis-NIR (250-950 nm), Vis-NIR (400-950 nm), and NIR (715-950 nm).The light intensity was measured by a spectroradiometer (ILT-900R, International Light Technologies).The photoreduction analysis system and light spectra with different cut-off filters were detailed in our previous publication 27. Before each test, the reactor loaded with samples and support glass fiber was initially purged with CO 2 and water vapor at 16 ml/min for 1 h, and then the flow rate was decreased and maintained at 3 ml/min for the test period.The light source was turned on (t 0 h) and measurements were made for 8 h.The concentrations of effluent gases (CO 2 , CO, CH 4 , O 2 , and N 2 ) as a function of irradiation time were recorded automatically by gas chromatography (GC, 6895 N, Agilent Technologies, Inc.) through an automated gas valve, using helium as the carrier gas.The GC was equipped with a PLOT capillary column (Supelco Carboxen-1010) and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD).To minimize potential errors, for each catalyst, experiments were repeated three times using fresh catalysts, and the production rates were averaged, and standard deviations were calculated. The morphology of the material and its elemental distribution of zinc, oxygen, and carbon were characterized by highresolution trasmission electron microscopy (TEM) -energydispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) (HR-TEM, JEOL J2100F) mapping technique.An X-ray Diffraction (XRD) instrument (D8 Advance, Bruker, USA) with Cu Ka radiation (k 1.548A) was used to determine the crystal phase.The specific surface area (S BET ), and pore diameter of the materials were measured using a surface area and pore diameter distribution analyzer (Micromeritics, ASAP 2020, USA).The S BET was calculated using the Brunauer-Emmet t-Teller (BET) method, and the pore size distribution was evaluated by non-local density functional theory (NLDFT).CO 2 adsorp-tion isotherms were measured using the same Micrometrics ASAP2020 equipment.All samples were degassed at 423 K overnight and sealed under vacuum prior to analysis.CO 2 was adsorbed at 298 K, and the pressure ranged from 10 to 760 mm Hg. The surface chemical properties were analyzed by laser Raman spectrometry (Renishaw InVia Reflex confocal Raman spectrometer, with a 514 nm laser) and XPS instrument (PHI 5000 VersaProbe II), equipped with a monochromatic Al Ka (1486.6 eV) X-ray source.Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of all the samples were recorded via a Nicolet is50 FTIR spectrometer.The thermal behavior of the as-synthesized materials was analyzed by thermal gravimetric and differential thermal analyses (TGA/DTA) (TA Instruments, New Castle, DE).A UV-Vis spectrophotometer (UV-2600, Shimadzu, USA) was used to obtain the optical properties of the materials. The fluorescence spectra of the materials were recorded using a Vis-NIR spectrofluorometer (Horiba Jobin Yvon Inc).The fluorescence lifetime was measured using the time-correlated singlephoton counting (TCSPC) method on a Fluorolog (Horiba) equipped with a PMT928P detector and an imaging spectrometer (iH320).DataStationO v2.2 (Horiba) was used for data acquisition.Lifetime measurements were conducted with 300 nm excitation from a NanoLED light source at a 1 MHz frequency and slit width of 8 nm.The valence band and conduction band positions were determined by ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS), with a Physical Electronics 5000 VersaProbe II Scanning ESCA Microprobe.An He I (21.2 eV) ultraviolet source was used, and a 5 V bias was applied to the sample to observe a clear secondary electron edge.The samples were prepared on Si wafer coated with an 15 nm thick gold film. Photoelectrochemical measurements were performed in a three-electrode cell setup.A Pt wire and Ag/AgCl bar were used as the counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively.For the working electrode, 5 mg of the material powder was dispersed in 0.75 ml of DI water, followed by the addition of 20 ll of Nafion solution (0.05, Sigma-Aldrich).After ultrasonication for 30 min, the above suspension was dropped onto the surface of an indium tin oxide (ITO) conductor glass slide.The working electrode was then dried at 60 C.The photocurrent was measured using a CHI 760 Bipotentiostat in 0.1 M Na 2 SO 4 solution 2.4.In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) In situ DRIFT experiments (Figure S2) were performed on a Nicolet is50 spectrometer equipped with a Harrick Scientific DRIFT cell and a mercury-cadmium-telluride (MCT) detector cooled by liquid N 2 .DRIFT spectra were collected in the range of 3800-1200 cm A1 , accumulating 64 scans at 4 cm A1 resolution in the Kubelka A Munk format.Prior to each test, all samples were held at 100 C under helium flow (30 ml/min) for 0.5 h, and then cooled to 60 C to get a background IR spectrum to be subtracted from the sample spectra for each measurement.The helium flow was immediately stopped, and CO 2 /H 2 O mixture was introduced into the chamber with a flow rate of 4 ml/min for 60 min in the dark when the intensities of adsorption peaks reached saturation.Next, the light source was turned on for 60 min to monitor the adsorbed intermediates during the photoreduction reactions."}, {"llm generation": "UV-Vis-NIR light", "source": "The calculated apparent quantum yield (AQY) over OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -600 was 0.26 (see Table S4 for detailed calculation) under UV-Vis-NIR light, which is much higher than the reported values in the literature (Table S5).", "context": "The formation of OD-ZnO/C composite via the FuAR process is based on the ''droplet to particle\" mechanism, and the effect of synthesis temperature, an important parameter determining the particle formation 28, was first studied.As displayed in the TEM images in Fig. 1, the obtained particles prepared at all temperatures had a spherical morphology, originating from the atomized droplets whose spherical shape was retained during the rapid FuAR process.Interestingly, only solid particles are observed on the OD-ZnO/C-N 2 sample that is synthesized at 350 C, but porous and hollow particles appear to evolve when the FuAR temperature further increases from 400 to 600 C.Similar hollow particles are also found on the OD-ZnO/C-Air samples prepared at temperatures from 500 to 650 C (Figure S3).These findings indicate that the FuAR temperature, rather than the carrier gas atmosphere, predominantly affects the evolution of the hollow structures. The XRD patterns in Fig. 2 show that all samples exhibit almost identical wurtzite ZnO structures with no observed impurity phases, and the diffractions reflections at 31.7, 34.4, 36.2,47.6, 56.5, 62.9, 66.7, 67.9and 69.1correspond to the (1 0 0), (0 0 2), (1 0 1), (1 0 2), (1 1 0), (1 0 3), (2 0 0), (1 1 2) and (2 0 1) crystal planes 29, respectively.With increased FuAR temperature, the diffraction intensities of the wurtzite ZnO structure are more intense.Also, the diffractions reflections of the OD-ZnO/C-Air samples are obviously stronger and sharper than those of the OD-ZnO/ C-N 2 samples.The enhanced crystallinity of the OD-ZnO/C-Air samples could be caused by their higher reaction temperature, due to the more intensive decomposition of citric acid in a hightemperature oxidative environment 30. The carbon content in the OD-ZnO/C samples was determined by TGA in air, as illustrated in Figure S4a andb.All samples display a two-step weight loss, in the ranges of 40-300 and 300-500 C.The first weight loss is attributed to the desorption of physically and/or chemically adsorbed water on the catalyst surface, whereas the weight loss between 300 and 500 C is associated with the complete combustion of deposited carbons in the samples 27.The carbon content was calculated from the weight difference over the temperature range of 300 to 500 C.The contents of carbon and ZnO based on the TG measurments are summarized in the Table S2.It is obvious that the higher the FuAR temperature, the lower the amount of carbon present in the resultant OD-ZnO/C products.Furthermore, the OD-ZnO/C-Air samples have lower carbon contents than the OD-ZnO/C-N 2 samples.The decrease in the carbon contents of the OD-ZnO/C-Air samples likely resulted from the more intensive decomposition of citric acid in a hightemperature oxidative environment. The corresponding TEM-EDX images, shown in Fig. 3(a1)-(a4), exhibit uniformly distributed elemental Zn, O, and C throughout the whole OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -600 particle.The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Fig. 3b) displays six diffraction rings, perfectly corresponding to the same positions as those from bulk ZnO 29, and these are indicative of a hexagonal wurtzite structure of highly crystalline OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -600, consistent with the XRD results.Moreover, the HR-TEM images of the OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -600 (Fig. 3c andd) show that the sizes of the carbon dots are around 2 nm, with a lattice spacing of 0.21 nm (Fig. 3e), corresponding to the (1 0 0) planes of graphitic carbon 21.FTIR spectroscopy was carried out to further confirm the identity of both phases and the functional groups on the surface of OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -600.In Fig. 3f, a peak around 1582 cm A1 is associated with skeleton vibration attributed to the aromatic C C group of the carbon dots 31, whereas the two bands at 2926 and 2865 cm A1 correspond to C-H stretching vibration 21.The band around 1060 cm A1 is associated with C-O stretching, and the bands at ca. 1379 and 1259 cm A1 are attributed to the C-OH and C-O-C bonds 32, respectively.The absorption band around 3403 cm A1 is assigned to surface hydrogen-bonded O-H stretching.Moreover, a characteristic band of Zn-O is also observed at ca. 425 cm A1 33.The calculated apparent quantum yield (AQY) over OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -600 was 0.26 (see Table S4 for detailed calculation) under UV-Vis-NIR light, which is much higher than the reported values in the literature (Table S5).For example, its AQY is almost 2, 4, 18, and 74 times greater than those of Ag/TiO 2 (QY 0.145), Pt 2 -Pt 0 /TiO 2 (QY 0.07), reduced TiO 2-x (QY 0.0141), and ZnO-CuO (QY 0.0035).Even under just Vis-NIR irradiation, its AQY can reach 0.13, which is about 1.2, 4, 7, and 8 times higher than reported values for Ag-Au/TiO 2 (0.11), mesoporous Co-TiO 2 (0.031), graphene-TiO 2 (0.0178), and Cd 1-x Zn x S (0.016).We also note that noble metal cocatalysts, which are commonly used in other CO 2 photoreduction schemes 34,35, are not involved in our synthesized materials; thus, it may be expected that their visible-and NIR-light photoactivies could even be further improved by coupling with other suitable heterojunctions. To confirm that any carbon-containing products in the effluent gas measured by GC originated from the photoreduction of the CO 2 reactant rather than from the catalysts, the catalysts were subjected to control tests under the following three conditions: (1) CO 2 source gas only, no catalyst and no glass fiber (the support for the samples) in the reactor, (2) CO 2 source gas with blank glass fiber in the reactor, and (3) N 2 source gas, catalyst, and glass fiber all in the reactor.In all cases, no CO 2 reduction products (e.g., CO or CH 4 ) were detected whether the light was on or off, and CO was the only product detected in the presence of all three necessary components (light, CO 2 H 2 O, and catalyst).As further confirmation, an experiment was conducted using 13 CO 2 isotope in place of 12 CO 2 and the OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -600 sample under light irradiation, and the gas and mass chromatography spectra of the resulting gas samples are shown in Figure S6.A significant peak at m/z 29, assigned to 13 CO, verifies that CO is indeed produced from the CO 2 reactant, not from the decomposition of carbon dots on the OD-ZnO/C samples.Although H 2 has been reported as a competitive reduction product during the CO 2 photoreduction with H 2 O, we were not able to detect the very low concentration of H 2 because of the detection limit of the GC column.The absence of H 2 indicates that it is a minor reaction product compared to CO.Also, the produced H 2 may also be rapidly consumed by CO 2 during the photocatalytic process, as suggested by the previous studies 28,36.Nevertheless, the evolution of O 2 during CO 2 photoreduction (Figure S7) further verifies that both photoreduction (CO 2 being reduced to CO) and photooxidation (H 2 O being oxidized to O 2 ) reactions occurred simultaneously in the reactor system.Fig. 4b depicts the time-dependent production yields of CO from CO 2 photoreduction over OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -600 and OD-ZnO/C-Air-550 under UV-Vis-NIR irradiation.The CO production yields of both samples decrease after reaching peak values, indicating catalytic deterioration.However, it is interesting to note that the decrease in CO production on OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -600 is much slower (14) than the drastic activity change on OD-ZnO/C-Air-550 (60).Catalytic deactivation in gas-phase CO 2 photoreduction in the absence of a sacrificial agent has been commonly observed on various materials, including TiO 2 37 , CeO 2 38 , and g-C 3 N 4 39, likely caused by the loss of active sites (e.g., oxygen vacancies) or by high surface coverage by less reactive carbon intermediates 40,41.Nevertheless, after the heat treatment at 250 C in a N 2 flow for 2 h, the activity of the used OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -600 was recovered, and reached nearly 90 of the value for fresh OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -600 in the following cycles.It is thus believed that the accumulation of carbon intermediates on the active sites is the main reason for the decreased CO 2 reduction efficiency. The pore structures of the OD-ZnO/C materials were analyzed by nitrogen physisorption measurement, with the results illustrated in Fig. 5a.A type IV adsorption isotherm, along with an H3 hysteresis loop over a P/Po range of 0.2-1.0,are observed on all samples, and this feature has been reported to be associated with hollow materials with a nanoporous shell 42.The adsorption at P/Po values in the range of 0.2-0.5 is ascribed to the capillary condensation of nitrogen inside nanopores in the shells, whereas the second adsorption at P/Po 0.7-0.9 is associated with the filling of the large hollow interiors.Pore size distribution plots of the samples, calculated by NLDFT, are depicted in Figure S8, and they indicate multi-modal porous structures with wide pore size distributions for all OD-ZnO/C samples.Such structures likely result from the release of gas due to the thermal decomposition of citric acid in the FuAR.The S BET of the OD-ZnO/C samples decreases in the order of OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -650 (100 m 2 /g) OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -600 (79 m 2 /g) OD-ZnO/C-Air-550 (75 m 2 /g) OD-ZnO/C-Air-600 (54 m 2 /g).Generally, a high-surface-area catalyst is favored to enhance catalytic activity by providing a higher number of reaction sites.However, OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -650, which has the highest S BET among the studied catalysts, did not have the highest catalytic activity; rather, its activity was inferior even to that of OD-ZnO/ C-Air-550 with a lower S BET .This result indicates that the S BET of the catalyst is not a decisive factor in determining CO 2 photoreduction efficiency. The graphitic structure of the carbon dots and defect nature of the OD-ZnO in the OD-ZnO/C composite were determined by Raman spectroscopy.As seen in Fig. 5b, two peaks at 1360 and 1585 cm A1 , assigned to the D and G bands respectively, are observed for all samples.The D band is associated with local defects and disorders in graphitic carbon, and the G band corresponds to the sp 2 -hybridized carbon atoms in a hexagonal lattice 43.Moreover, the intensity ratio of the D band to the G band (I D /I G ) is commonly used to measure the density of defects in graphite materials 44.In this study, the I D /I G values of both OD-ZnO/ C-N 2 samples are lower than those of the OD-ZnO/C-Air ones, implying a higher graphitization degree of the OD-ZnO/C-N 2 samples.A high graphitization degree reportedly increases the electrical conductivity of carbon material, and is favorable for electron transfer, thus enhancing photocatalytic performance 43. Two intensive bands over the range 350-700 cm A1 are also visible for all OD-ZnO/C samples (Fig. 5c).The peak at 435 cm A1 is attributed to the presence of the wurtzite phase of ZnO, whereas the peak around 580 cm A1 corresponds to the defect-induced oxygen vacancy.Across the samples, the intensities of this 580 cm A1 peak decrease in the order of OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -650 OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -600 OD-ZnO/C-Air-550 OD-ZnO/C-Air-600, suggesting that OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -650 has the most oxygen vacancies and OD-ZnO/C-Air-600 has the fewest. The nonstoichiometry in the OD-ZnO/C samples was further accessed by XPS, with the results shown in Fig. 5d.The peak centered at a band energy of about 528.3 eV originates from the lattice oxygen anions O 2-(O I ), whereas the peak at 529.9 eV is ascribed to surface oxygen vacancy defects (O II ).The ratio of the areas under the peaks of O II and O I are 58, 65, 37, and 20 for OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -600, OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -650, OD-ZnO/C-Air-550, and OD-ZnO/C-Air-600, indicating that OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -650 has the most surface oxygen vacancies.Both the Raman and XPS results verified a higher number of oxygen vacancies for the OD-ZnO/C-N 2 samples than for the OD-ZnO/C-Air samples.Oxygen vacancies in nonstoichiometric semiconductor photocatalysts have been reported to act as electron donors to the conduction band, and thus they are advantageous for suppressing the recombination of photoexcited electron/hole pairs and improving photocatalytic performance 45,46. Diffuse reflectance spectra of the OD-ZnO/C samples are shown in Fig. 6a.All samples exhibit a steep increase in absorption at wavelengths shorter than 400 nm, owing to the intrinsic bandgap absorption of ZnO 47.Compared to the OD-ZnO/C-Air samples, the OD-ZnO/C-N 2 samples show a gradual color change from brownish-white (OD-ZnO/C-Air-600) to grayish-black (OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -650) (inset of Fig. 6a), accompanied by considerably increased absorption in the entire UV-Vis-NIR spectrum region (300-1100 nm).The enhanced light absorption could be attributed to the narrow gap sp 2 carbon present in the carbon dots.21 Moreover, a red shift in the absorption edges suggests a reduced bandgap, which might imply the formation of chemical bonds between the OD-ZnO and carbon dots, as well as the formation of additional sub-band energy levels between the CB and VB, similar to results reported for TiO 2 -CDs and Bi 2 WO 6 -CDs heterostructures 12,20. CO 2 adsorption on the catalyst surface is important in CO 2 photoreduction.In this study, the CO 2 adsorption capacities of the samples were measured by the CO 2 physisorption technique.As Fig. 6b shows, the CO 2 adsorption capacity of the samples is in the order of OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -650 (10.36 cm 3 /g) OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -600 (7.65 cm 3 /g) OD-ZnO/C-Air-550 (7.21 cm 3 /g) OD-ZnO/C-Air-6 00 (4.90 cm 3 /g).It is generally accepted that high CO 2 adsorption by a catalyst improves subsequent catalytic reactions 48.In this regard, the highest activity of OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -600 could also be related to its high CO 2 adsorption capacity, revealing the importance of the CO 2 adsorption process in the current reaction scheme.However, we note that the photocatalytic activity of OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -650 is inferior to those of OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -600 and OD-ZnO/C-Air-550, even though they have lower CO 2 adsorption and light absorption abilities.Clearly, in this study, the CO 2 adsorption ability of the catalyst is not decisive in determining the CO 2 photoreduction efficiency. The lifetime of charge carriers vitally affects the catalytic efficiency of a photocatalytic system, and here it was captured by the time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) technique.As shown in Fig. 6c, the lifetime of photogenerated charge carriers on OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -600 was estimated to be 9.03 ns (Fig. 6c), which was approximately 2.7 times longer than that of OD-ZnO/C-Air-550 6d.All the samples respond with a steady photocurrent under Vis-NIR irradiation, and all of them produce electron/hole pairs.OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -600 exhibits the highest photocurrent intensity; in addition, it photocurrent shows a delayed decay, resulting from trapped charge carriers with prolonged lifetimes 45.Altogether, these results indicate that OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -600 has the highest charge carrier separation efficiency. We consider that the increased photocurrent density should result from the enhanced charge carrier transfer contributed by the oxygen vacancies in OD-ZnO, and to the superior conductivity contributed by the carbon dots.Previous studies showed that a high concentration electron in the oxygen vacancy defect band can absorb photons and transit to the conduction band, resulting in the improved photocurrent 23,49.Nevertheless, it was noticed that OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -650, having the highest concentration of oxygen vacancy, showed a relative lower photocurrent density than those of the OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -600 and OD-ZnO/C-Air-550.This finding clearly points out the importance to carefully control the concentration of oxygen vacancy defect in the OD-ZnO.An excessive number of oxygen vacancies may greatly increase electron scattering, and reduce the carrier mobility because of the formation of defect-related recombination centers, which rather prohibits the generation of photocurrent than to promote it 50. Moreover, the relative photocurrent density intensities are well consistent with the corresponding CO 2 reduction activity (Fig. 4a), which confirms the critical significance of the separation efficiency of charge carriers in CO 2 photoreduction.Consequently, we conclude that although the improved adsorption of CO 2 on catalyst surface is beneficial in promoting the CO 2 photoreduction, the efficiency of separation and transfer of photoexcited charge carriers plays a predominant role in determining the photoactivity in these OD-ZnO/C samples. To gain further insights into the enhanced CO 2 photoreduction properties and reaction pathway, we used in situ DRIFTS measurements.The DRIFT spectrum of the OD-ZnO/C-Air-550 after CO 2 / H 2 O adsorption in the dark is shown in Fig. 7a, which indicates four distinguishable bands at 3595, 3628, 3703, and 3728 cm A1 , which can all be assigned to hydroxyl groups from H 2 O dissociation 51.With prolonged adsorption, the intensities of these bands increase only slightly, indicating a limited number of hydroxyl groups on the OD-ZnO/C-Air-550 surface.For OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -600 (Fig. 7b), three additional new bands appear, at 3480, 3517, and 3555 cm A1 , which are reported as hydroxyl groups from H 2 O dissociation on defect sites 52.The intensities of these three bands increase progressively with time, the result of multilayer adsorption of H 2 O via H-bonding on the defect sites 51.This progressive growth considerably contributes to the high water adsorption capacity of OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -600, and was not observed when OD-ZnO/C-Air-550 was exposed to the CO 2 /H 2 O mixture. Defects in metal-based photocatalysts significantly impact the adsorption/activation energies of H 2 O 53.Previous studies showed that H 2 O dissociation is more kinetically favored on low coordination oxygen vacancy sites, leading to the formation of bridging OH species 54.Recent experimental and theoretical studies have demonstrated the important role played by oxygen vacancies in promoting the dissociation of H 2 O molecules to produce active H atoms, and also in acting as an atomic hydrogen reservoir 55.Thus, it is expected that the more oxygen vacancies on the OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -600 than on OD-ZnO/C-Air-550 are favorable in dissociating H 2 O to protons, and they also act as an atomic hydrogen reservoir that offers sufficient and readily available protons, enhancing photocatalytic activity. In the meantime, a number of bands can also be identified on both samples over the range of 1200-2000 cm A1 .The exposure of OD-ZnO/C-Air-550 to humid CO 2 in the dark causes the appearance of monodentate carbonate (m-CO 3 -, 1308 and 1495 cm A1 ), bidentate carbonate (b-CO 3 2-, 1395 cm A1 ), formate (HCOO -, 1563 and 1765 cm A1 ), and molecularly adsorbed H 2 O (1640 cm A1 ), as shown in Fig. 8a andb.When the light illumination (UV-Vis-NIR and Vis-NIR) is introduced, the intensities of all the intermediates decrease with prolonged illumination time.Compared to OD-ZnO/ C-Air-550, OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -600 exhibits dominant intermediates of bicarbonate (HCO 3 -, 1427 cm A1 ) and formate species, as depicted in Fig. 9a, b andc.An extra band at 1254 cm A1 , corresponding to CO 2 -species 38, is also observed.After saturated adsorption in the dark, illuminating OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -600 by UV-Vis-NIR (Fig. 9a) or Vis-NIR (Fig. 9b) light induces the dramatically decreased intensities of the intermediates, indicating the effective photoconversion of the surface intermediates on the OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -600 surface.In particular, the formate species almost disappear.Furthermore, one also note that under illumination of NIR light only, both the CO 2 -and formate species are still effectively consumed in comparison to that of the bicarbonate.The much faster disappearance of the CO 2 -and formate species in comparison to that of the bicarbonate clearly demonstrates its higher reactivity under light irradiation.The formation of carbon-containing intermediates varies according to the adsorption sites that interact with CO 2 36.The CO 3 2-species originates from the interaction of CO 2 with surface oxygen atoms of metal oxide through its carbon atom 3, whereas HCO 3 -is generated when a CO 2 molecule is bonded to the surface hydroxyl groups 56.It is widely recognized that one-electron reduction of CO 2 to CO 2 -critically impacts the efficiency of CO 2 photoreduction 57,58.The presence of CO 2 -species clearly indicates that one-electron reduction of CO 2 to CO 2 -can readily occur on the defect-rich surface of the OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -600.Research on defective metal oxide catalysts for CO 2 photoreduction has shown that oxygen defect sites not only provide active sites, but also inject free electrons into the adsorbed CO 2 , inducing a bent CO 2 configuration, a precursor for the formation of CO 2 -anions 59,60.Upon receiving electrons, the O-C-O angles of adsorbed CO 2 are reduced significantly on binding sites, and the more bent the geometry of the adsorbed CO 2 molecule, the easier the transfer of the electrons to CO 2 to form CO 2 -anions 59.The obtained CO 2 -is further transformed into HCOO -with the assistance of protons from H 2 O dissociation 36. Compared to carbonate species, CO 2 -and HCOO -are more active and can readily be photo-reduced to the final products when they receive sufficient numbers of electrons and protons upon light irradiation 38.Hence, the preferential formation of both CO 2 -and HCOO -species on OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -600 is considered as key to their superior photoactivities to the OD-ZnO/C-Air-550.To be more specific, the higher intensities of both HCOO -and CO 2 -bands are observed on OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -600, implying its stronger activation ability for a CO 2 /H 2 O vapor mixture, which partially explains its superior CO 2 photoreduction efficiency.Accordingly, the poor adsorption/activation ability of OD-ZnO/C-Air-550 toward CO 2 / H 2 O plausibly accounts for its lesser photoactivity.The above results clearly suggest the importance of CO 2 /H 2 O activation in determining CO 2 photoreduction efficiency.Fig. 10a shows the steady-state PL spectrum of OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -600.A strong luminescence emission at 460 nm, along with a weak emission at 560 nm are observed.The appearance of visible luminescence emissions implies the formation of defect-related energy states between the CB and VB of the OD-ZnO.According to previous studies 61,62, the emission at 460 nm is associated with the recombination of photoexcited electrons that were trapped in the defect state with the photoexcited holes in VB.The emission at 560 nm is attributed to the recombination of the photoexcited electron in CB with holes trapped in the oxygen interstitial level.Furthermore, a weak emission at 385 nm is also observed (Fig. 10a, inset), which represents the intrinsic emission from ZnO 61.Compared to the defect-induced emissions, the weak intensity of the emission at 385 indicates that high concentrations of defects were introduced in the OD-ZnO.The emission at 350 nm corresponds to the emission from the C-N 2 -600 carbon dots, as evidenced by their PL spectrum (Fig. 10b), in which peaks appear at 350, 425, 510, and 550 nm.The emission at 350 nm corresponds to the p-p transition of aromatic domains in the carbon dots, whereas the other three emissions are related to oxygencontaining surface states 21.The upconverting properties of C-N 2 -600 carbon dots was also testified by the PL technique, with results displayed in Fig. 10c.The PL spectrum of C-N 2 -600 excited by long wavelengths of 700 and 750 nm shows upconverting emissions in the range of 400-550 nm.This upconverting PL property of C-N 2 -600 is ascribed to multi-photon active processes 31, which should account for its excellent photocatalytic performance.In addition to the intrinsic defects within the OD-ZnO and C-N 2 -600 samples, their band alignment is also important in determining their interfacial charge transfer, and thus their photocatalytic activity 20.UPS spectroscopy was carried out to investigate the band structures of OD-ZnO and C-N 2 -600, with the results shown in Fig. 10d.The VB spectrum of C-N 2 -600 exhibits five main peaks, which correspond to C 2p-p, 2p-(r-p) overlap, C 2p-r, C 2 s-2p mixed state, and C 2 s state 63.The various states in the VB spectrum of C-N 2 -600 indicate different oxygen-containing functional groups on its surface, consistent with the FTIR and PL results. The work function of the samples (energy of the Fermi level with respect to vacuum) is the difference between photon energy and the energy between the secondary electron emission edge (blue circle mark) and the onset of the filled density of states (green vertical tick).The gap between the fermi level and valance band maximum is the onset of the photoemission of valence electrons (green vertical tick), using which VB position is calculated.CB minimum is calculated using the VB maximum, Fermi level, and the band gap determined from PL spectrum.With aforementioned information, the band alignment and the charge transfer between the OD-ZnO and C-N 2 -600 were obtained, as schematically shown in Fig. 10e.Considering the LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) potential of C-N 2 -600 locates above than the CB edge of OD-ZnO, giving a energy diffenrence of 0.42 eV to drive the eletron transfer from the the LUMO of C-N 2 -600 to the CB of OD-ZnO.Thus, the efficient transfer of charge carriers between OD-ZnO and C-N 2 -600 suppresses the electron-hole recombination, and contributes to the higher charge carrier density. Considering both these results and those in the literature, a possible reaction pathway for CO 2 photoreduction by H 2 O on OD-ZnO/ C-N 2 -600 is represented in Fig. 11 and described as follows.First, the hollow structure and high specific surface area of OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -600 are beneficial to the transport and adsorption of H 2 O and CO 2 molecules, which interact with various surface adsorption sites to form dissociative hydroxyl groups and several carbon intermediates.The rich surface defect sites significantly lower the reaction barriers and ensure strong adsorption and activation of CO 2 , and promote the preferential formation of CO 2 -and formate species on the OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -600.The formed species are then reduced to CO upon light irradiation, with a sufficient supply of electrons and protons from efficient charge separation and water dissociation.Note that only one electron is required for reducing CO 2 -to CO in this proposed pathway, which is energetically favored over the two-electron reduction of carbonate species to CO 64. In addition to effective adsorption/activation of the adsorbed CO 2 /H 2 O, strong light absorption and efficient charge separation are also prerequisites for achieving high photoactivity.As evidenced by the PL results, an OD-level of 0.52 eV below the CB of OD-ZnO was produced, which mediates visible-light absorption under Vis-NIR light (400 k 950 nm).On one hand, the OD-ZnO can be directly excited by incident light with energy greater than its bandgap.On the other hand, the carbon dots (C-N 2 -600) on the surface of the OD-ZnO, serving as light harvesters and converters, can absorb light with longer wavelengths (715 k 950 nm) and up-convert it into light with a shorter wavelength (400 k 550 nm), which further improves the utilization of Vis-NIR light.Under illumination with NIR only (715 k 950 nm), the carbon dots can absorb NIR light and then emit shorter wavelengths (400 k 550 nm) which excite the OD-ZnO to produce electron/hole pairs.Moreover, the proposed mechanism may also explain why the photoactivity of the OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -600 under Vis-NIR irradiation is superior to that under just NIR irradiation. Photoexcited electrons trapped in the oxygen defect state could also reduce the adsorbed CO 2 molecules because the OD-level potential (-3.82 eV with respect to vacuum) lies above the redox potential of CO 2 /CO (-3.91 eV with respect to vacuum) 65.Additionally, heterogeneous junctions formed between the OD-ZnO and C-N 2 -600 lead to more efficient interelectron transfer between the two componenets.The electrons accumulated on the surface of the OD-ZnO react with the adsorbed carbon intermediates in the presence of protons to evolve CO; concurrently, the photoexcited holes transfer to the surface of the C-N 2 -600 and trigger the oxidation of H 2 O to produce O 2 and protons 66.Hence, the co-presence of oxygen vacancy defects and carbon dots not only allows OD-ZnO/ C-N 2 -600 to utilize a wider solar spectrum, but also enables the efficient activation of CO 2 /H 2 O and suppresses the recombination of charge carriers.The end result is higher CO 2 photoreduction efficiency. The facile activation of CO 2 /H 2 O and the efficient charge separation should also enhance the photocatalytic stability of OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -600.As reported earlier, the high activity of the defect-rich catalyst surface is ascribed to the abundant oxygen vacancies at the initial stage of the reaction, but its activity decreases with prolonged reaction time if the oxygen vacancies are not effectively recovered 67.A recent theoratical study by Selloni et al. 68 showed that oxygen vacancies can be regenerated in the photo-oxidation of H 2 O by photoexcited holes created during CO 2 photoreduction with H 2 O.In this sense, the facile activation of The stability of the oxygen vacancies in our work was confirmed by the XPS analysis, as displayed in Figure S9.The signal intensities and binding energies of used OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -600 are nearly unchanged after the CO 2 photoreduction reaction, indicating that oxygen defects were well-preserved during the reaction.In our study, the surface of OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -600 is highly active for H 2 O activation, and thus it is hydroxylated owing to the defectinduced dissociative OH groups, as demonstrated in the DRIFT results (Fig. 7b).In addition, the surface intermediates on OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -600 are dominated by formate, HCO 3 -and CO 2 -, along with a certain amount of CO 3 2-(Fig.9).The formate and CO 2 -species can readily be transformed into CO by accepting sufficient quantities of electrons and protons from efficient charge separation and dissociate H 2 O 38,40, and leave the reaction sites empty for the next redox cycle.While the high stability of carbonates under photoirradiation, and its detrimental effects on CO 2 photocatalytic stability, have been commonly observed in previous studies 36,40.The accumulation of a certain amount of carbonates on the surface of OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -600 thus slowly deactivated the catalyst with prolonged reaction time, similar to results reported elsewhere 38.In contrast, for the OD-ZnO/C-Air-550, the numbers of surface hydroxyl groups are limited (Fig. 7a), and the CO 3 2-species is dominant on the surface (Fig. 8).As a result, they would occupy the surface reaction sites, and eventually resulted in the rapid photocatalytic deactivation, similar to the results elsewhere 38,39."}], "lamp": [{"llm generation": "Xenon", "source": "A 400 W Xenon lamp (Oriel 66021, Newport Co.) equipped with various cut-off filters to provide radiation in different wavelength regions, including UV-Vis-NIR (250-950 nm), Vis-NIR (400-950 nm), and NIR (715-950 nm).", "context": "The OD-ZnO/C composite was synthesized using zinc nitrate hexahydrate and citric acid as the precursors in a lab-built furnace aerosol reactor, as detailed in our previous study 27.In preliminary studies, we demonstrated the influence of the concentration of zinc nitrate on the catalytic activity of the synthesized OD-ZnO/C for the CO 2 photoreduction.When the concentration of zinc nitrate was 0.75 M, the resulting OD-ZnO/C showed the highest photocatalytic activity (Figure S1).Thus, the concentration of zinc nitrate was kept at 0.75 M in this work. Briefly, 8.92 g of zinc nitrate hexahydrate (0.03 mol) and 3.46 g of citric acid (0.018 mol) were dissolved in 40 ml of DI water under constant stirring.The precursor solution was then nebulized by a Collison nebulizer (BGI Incorporated); the droplets were carried by a 12 psi nitrogen flow through a diffusion dryer, and then a heating tubular furnace reactor in which the temperature was variously controlled at 500, 550, 600, or 650 C.The products were collected downstream of the reactor on a glass-fiber filter.The obtained samples were denoted OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -X, where X corresponds to the furnace temperature.With the same experimental setup, OD-ZnO/C-Air was also prepared with a fixed citric acid/zinc nitrate molar ratio of 0.6, and 12 psi compressed air was used as the carrier gas. The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 was conducted at ambient temperature in a lab-built continuous gas flow reactor.Compressed CO 2 (99.999,Praxair) was the carbon source, and was passed through a water bubbler to generate a mixture of CO 2 and water vapor.The gaseous mixture was then introduced into a homemade continuous flow reactor where the photocatalyst samples were loaded.A 400 W Xenon lamp (Oriel 66021, Newport Co.) equipped with various cut-off filters to provide radiation in different wavelength regions, including UV-Vis-NIR (250-950 nm), Vis-NIR (400-950 nm), and NIR (715-950 nm).The light intensity was measured by a spectroradiometer (ILT-900R, International Light Technologies).The photoreduction analysis system and light spectra with different cut-off filters were detailed in our previous publication 27. Before each test, the reactor loaded with samples and support glass fiber was initially purged with CO 2 and water vapor at 16 ml/min for 1 h, and then the flow rate was decreased and maintained at 3 ml/min for the test period.The light source was turned on (t 0 h) and measurements were made for 8 h.The concentrations of effluent gases (CO 2 , CO, CH 4 , O 2 , and N 2 ) as a function of irradiation time were recorded automatically by gas chromatography (GC, 6895 N, Agilent Technologies, Inc.) through an automated gas valve, using helium as the carrier gas.The GC was equipped with a PLOT capillary column (Supelco Carboxen-1010) and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD).To minimize potential errors, for each catalyst, experiments were repeated three times using fresh catalysts, and the production rates were averaged, and standard deviations were calculated. The morphology of the material and its elemental distribution of zinc, oxygen, and carbon were characterized by highresolution trasmission electron microscopy (TEM) -energydispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) (HR-TEM, JEOL J2100F) mapping technique.An X-ray Diffraction (XRD) instrument (D8 Advance, Bruker, USA) with Cu Ka radiation (k 1.548A) was used to determine the crystal phase.The specific surface area (S BET ), and pore diameter of the materials were measured using a surface area and pore diameter distribution analyzer (Micromeritics, ASAP 2020, USA).The S BET was calculated using the Brunauer-Emmet t-Teller (BET) method, and the pore size distribution was evaluated by non-local density functional theory (NLDFT).CO 2 adsorp-tion isotherms were measured using the same Micrometrics ASAP2020 equipment.All samples were degassed at 423 K overnight and sealed under vacuum prior to analysis.CO 2 was adsorbed at 298 K, and the pressure ranged from 10 to 760 mm Hg. The surface chemical properties were analyzed by laser Raman spectrometry (Renishaw InVia Reflex confocal Raman spectrometer, with a 514 nm laser) and XPS instrument (PHI 5000 VersaProbe II), equipped with a monochromatic Al Ka (1486.6 eV) X-ray source.Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of all the samples were recorded via a Nicolet is50 FTIR spectrometer.The thermal behavior of the as-synthesized materials was analyzed by thermal gravimetric and differential thermal analyses (TGA/DTA) (TA Instruments, New Castle, DE).A UV-Vis spectrophotometer (UV-2600, Shimadzu, USA) was used to obtain the optical properties of the materials. The fluorescence spectra of the materials were recorded using a Vis-NIR spectrofluorometer (Horiba Jobin Yvon Inc).The fluorescence lifetime was measured using the time-correlated singlephoton counting (TCSPC) method on a Fluorolog (Horiba) equipped with a PMT928P detector and an imaging spectrometer (iH320).DataStationO v2.2 (Horiba) was used for data acquisition.Lifetime measurements were conducted with 300 nm excitation from a NanoLED light source at a 1 MHz frequency and slit width of 8 nm.The valence band and conduction band positions were determined by ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS), with a Physical Electronics 5000 VersaProbe II Scanning ESCA Microprobe.An He I (21.2 eV) ultraviolet source was used, and a 5 V bias was applied to the sample to observe a clear secondary electron edge.The samples were prepared on Si wafer coated with an 15 nm thick gold film. Photoelectrochemical measurements were performed in a three-electrode cell setup.A Pt wire and Ag/AgCl bar were used as the counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively.For the working electrode, 5 mg of the material powder was dispersed in 0.75 ml of DI water, followed by the addition of 20 ll of Nafion solution (0.05, Sigma-Aldrich).After ultrasonication for 30 min, the above suspension was dropped onto the surface of an indium tin oxide (ITO) conductor glass slide.The working electrode was then dried at 60 C.The photocurrent was measured using a CHI 760 Bipotentiostat in 0.1 M Na 2 SO 4 solution 2.4.In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) In situ DRIFT experiments (Figure S2) were performed on a Nicolet is50 spectrometer equipped with a Harrick Scientific DRIFT cell and a mercury-cadmium-telluride (MCT) detector cooled by liquid N 2 .DRIFT spectra were collected in the range of 3800-1200 cm A1 , accumulating 64 scans at 4 cm A1 resolution in the Kubelka A Munk format.Prior to each test, all samples were held at 100 C under helium flow (30 ml/min) for 0.5 h, and then cooled to 60 C to get a background IR spectrum to be subtracted from the sample spectra for each measurement.The helium flow was immediately stopped, and CO 2 /H 2 O mixture was introduced into the chamber with a flow rate of 4 ml/min for 60 min in the dark when the intensities of adsorption peaks reached saturation.Next, the light source was turned on for 60 min to monitor the adsorbed intermediates during the photoreduction reactions."}], "reaction medium": [{"llm generation": "Gas", "source": "Catalytic deactivation in gas-phase CO 2 photoreduction in the absence of a sacrificial agent has been commonly observed on various materials, including TiO 2 37 , CeO 2 38 , and g-C 3 N 4 39, likely caused by the loss of active sites (e.g., oxygen vacancies) or by high surface coverage by less reactive carbon intermediates 40,41.", "context": "The formation of OD-ZnO/C composite via the FuAR process is based on the ''droplet to particle\" mechanism, and the effect of synthesis temperature, an important parameter determining the particle formation 28, was first studied.As displayed in the TEM images in Fig. 1, the obtained particles prepared at all temperatures had a spherical morphology, originating from the atomized droplets whose spherical shape was retained during the rapid FuAR process.Interestingly, only solid particles are observed on the OD-ZnO/C-N 2 sample that is synthesized at 350 C, but porous and hollow particles appear to evolve when the FuAR temperature further increases from 400 to 600 C.Similar hollow particles are also found on the OD-ZnO/C-Air samples prepared at temperatures from 500 to 650 C (Figure S3).These findings indicate that the FuAR temperature, rather than the carrier gas atmosphere, predominantly affects the evolution of the hollow structures. The XRD patterns in Fig. 2 show that all samples exhibit almost identical wurtzite ZnO structures with no observed impurity phases, and the diffractions reflections at 31.7, 34.4, 36.2,47.6, 56.5, 62.9, 66.7, 67.9and 69.1correspond to the (1 0 0), (0 0 2), (1 0 1), (1 0 2), (1 1 0), (1 0 3), (2 0 0), (1 1 2) and (2 0 1) crystal planes 29, respectively.With increased FuAR temperature, the diffraction intensities of the wurtzite ZnO structure are more intense.Also, the diffractions reflections of the OD-ZnO/C-Air samples are obviously stronger and sharper than those of the OD-ZnO/ C-N 2 samples.The enhanced crystallinity of the OD-ZnO/C-Air samples could be caused by their higher reaction temperature, due to the more intensive decomposition of citric acid in a hightemperature oxidative environment 30. The carbon content in the OD-ZnO/C samples was determined by TGA in air, as illustrated in Figure S4a andb.All samples display a two-step weight loss, in the ranges of 40-300 and 300-500 C.The first weight loss is attributed to the desorption of physically and/or chemically adsorbed water on the catalyst surface, whereas the weight loss between 300 and 500 C is associated with the complete combustion of deposited carbons in the samples 27.The carbon content was calculated from the weight difference over the temperature range of 300 to 500 C.The contents of carbon and ZnO based on the TG measurments are summarized in the Table S2.It is obvious that the higher the FuAR temperature, the lower the amount of carbon present in the resultant OD-ZnO/C products.Furthermore, the OD-ZnO/C-Air samples have lower carbon contents than the OD-ZnO/C-N 2 samples.The decrease in the carbon contents of the OD-ZnO/C-Air samples likely resulted from the more intensive decomposition of citric acid in a hightemperature oxidative environment. The corresponding TEM-EDX images, shown in Fig. 3(a1)-(a4), exhibit uniformly distributed elemental Zn, O, and C throughout the whole OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -600 particle.The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Fig. 3b) displays six diffraction rings, perfectly corresponding to the same positions as those from bulk ZnO 29, and these are indicative of a hexagonal wurtzite structure of highly crystalline OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -600, consistent with the XRD results.Moreover, the HR-TEM images of the OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -600 (Fig. 3c andd) show that the sizes of the carbon dots are around 2 nm, with a lattice spacing of 0.21 nm (Fig. 3e), corresponding to the (1 0 0) planes of graphitic carbon 21.FTIR spectroscopy was carried out to further confirm the identity of both phases and the functional groups on the surface of OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -600.In Fig. 3f, a peak around 1582 cm A1 is associated with skeleton vibration attributed to the aromatic C C group of the carbon dots 31, whereas the two bands at 2926 and 2865 cm A1 correspond to C-H stretching vibration 21.The band around 1060 cm A1 is associated with C-O stretching, and the bands at ca. 1379 and 1259 cm A1 are attributed to the C-OH and C-O-C bonds 32, respectively.The absorption band around 3403 cm A1 is assigned to surface hydrogen-bonded O-H stretching.Moreover, a characteristic band of Zn-O is also observed at ca. 425 cm A1 33.The calculated apparent quantum yield (AQY) over OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -600 was 0.26 (see Table S4 for detailed calculation) under UV-Vis-NIR light, which is much higher than the reported values in the literature (Table S5).For example, its AQY is almost 2, 4, 18, and 74 times greater than those of Ag/TiO 2 (QY 0.145), Pt 2 -Pt 0 /TiO 2 (QY 0.07), reduced TiO 2-x (QY 0.0141), and ZnO-CuO (QY 0.0035).Even under just Vis-NIR irradiation, its AQY can reach 0.13, which is about 1.2, 4, 7, and 8 times higher than reported values for Ag-Au/TiO 2 (0.11), mesoporous Co-TiO 2 (0.031), graphene-TiO 2 (0.0178), and Cd 1-x Zn x S (0.016).We also note that noble metal cocatalysts, which are commonly used in other CO 2 photoreduction schemes 34,35, are not involved in our synthesized materials; thus, it may be expected that their visible-and NIR-light photoactivies could even be further improved by coupling with other suitable heterojunctions. To confirm that any carbon-containing products in the effluent gas measured by GC originated from the photoreduction of the CO 2 reactant rather than from the catalysts, the catalysts were subjected to control tests under the following three conditions: (1) CO 2 source gas only, no catalyst and no glass fiber (the support for the samples) in the reactor, (2) CO 2 source gas with blank glass fiber in the reactor, and (3) N 2 source gas, catalyst, and glass fiber all in the reactor.In all cases, no CO 2 reduction products (e.g., CO or CH 4 ) were detected whether the light was on or off, and CO was the only product detected in the presence of all three necessary components (light, CO 2 H 2 O, and catalyst).As further confirmation, an experiment was conducted using 13 CO 2 isotope in place of 12 CO 2 and the OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -600 sample under light irradiation, and the gas and mass chromatography spectra of the resulting gas samples are shown in Figure S6.A significant peak at m/z 29, assigned to 13 CO, verifies that CO is indeed produced from the CO 2 reactant, not from the decomposition of carbon dots on the OD-ZnO/C samples.Although H 2 has been reported as a competitive reduction product during the CO 2 photoreduction with H 2 O, we were not able to detect the very low concentration of H 2 because of the detection limit of the GC column.The absence of H 2 indicates that it is a minor reaction product compared to CO.Also, the produced H 2 may also be rapidly consumed by CO 2 during the photocatalytic process, as suggested by the previous studies 28,36.Nevertheless, the evolution of O 2 during CO 2 photoreduction (Figure S7) further verifies that both photoreduction (CO 2 being reduced to CO) and photooxidation (H 2 O being oxidized to O 2 ) reactions occurred simultaneously in the reactor system.Fig. 4b depicts the time-dependent production yields of CO from CO 2 photoreduction over OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -600 and OD-ZnO/C-Air-550 under UV-Vis-NIR irradiation.The CO production yields of both samples decrease after reaching peak values, indicating catalytic deterioration.However, it is interesting to note that the decrease in CO production on OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -600 is much slower (14) than the drastic activity change on OD-ZnO/C-Air-550 (60).Catalytic deactivation in gas-phase CO 2 photoreduction in the absence of a sacrificial agent has been commonly observed on various materials, including TiO 2 37 , CeO 2 38 , and g-C 3 N 4 39, likely caused by the loss of active sites (e.g., oxygen vacancies) or by high surface coverage by less reactive carbon intermediates 40,41.Nevertheless, after the heat treatment at 250 C in a N 2 flow for 2 h, the activity of the used OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -600 was recovered, and reached nearly 90 of the value for fresh OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -600 in the following cycles.It is thus believed that the accumulation of carbon intermediates on the active sites is the main reason for the decreased CO 2 reduction efficiency. The pore structures of the OD-ZnO/C materials were analyzed by nitrogen physisorption measurement, with the results illustrated in Fig. 5a.A type IV adsorption isotherm, along with an H3 hysteresis loop over a P/Po range of 0.2-1.0,are observed on all samples, and this feature has been reported to be associated with hollow materials with a nanoporous shell 42.The adsorption at P/Po values in the range of 0.2-0.5 is ascribed to the capillary condensation of nitrogen inside nanopores in the shells, whereas the second adsorption at P/Po 0.7-0.9 is associated with the filling of the large hollow interiors.Pore size distribution plots of the samples, calculated by NLDFT, are depicted in Figure S8, and they indicate multi-modal porous structures with wide pore size distributions for all OD-ZnO/C samples.Such structures likely result from the release of gas due to the thermal decomposition of citric acid in the FuAR.The S BET of the OD-ZnO/C samples decreases in the order of OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -650 (100 m 2 /g) OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -600 (79 m 2 /g) OD-ZnO/C-Air-550 (75 m 2 /g) OD-ZnO/C-Air-600 (54 m 2 /g).Generally, a high-surface-area catalyst is favored to enhance catalytic activity by providing a higher number of reaction sites.However, OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -650, which has the highest S BET among the studied catalysts, did not have the highest catalytic activity; rather, its activity was inferior even to that of OD-ZnO/ C-Air-550 with a lower S BET .This result indicates that the S BET of the catalyst is not a decisive factor in determining CO 2 photoreduction efficiency. The graphitic structure of the carbon dots and defect nature of the OD-ZnO in the OD-ZnO/C composite were determined by Raman spectroscopy.As seen in Fig. 5b, two peaks at 1360 and 1585 cm A1 , assigned to the D and G bands respectively, are observed for all samples.The D band is associated with local defects and disorders in graphitic carbon, and the G band corresponds to the sp 2 -hybridized carbon atoms in a hexagonal lattice 43.Moreover, the intensity ratio of the D band to the G band (I D /I G ) is commonly used to measure the density of defects in graphite materials 44.In this study, the I D /I G values of both OD-ZnO/ C-N 2 samples are lower than those of the OD-ZnO/C-Air ones, implying a higher graphitization degree of the OD-ZnO/C-N 2 samples.A high graphitization degree reportedly increases the electrical conductivity of carbon material, and is favorable for electron transfer, thus enhancing photocatalytic performance 43. Two intensive bands over the range 350-700 cm A1 are also visible for all OD-ZnO/C samples (Fig. 5c).The peak at 435 cm A1 is attributed to the presence of the wurtzite phase of ZnO, whereas the peak around 580 cm A1 corresponds to the defect-induced oxygen vacancy.Across the samples, the intensities of this 580 cm A1 peak decrease in the order of OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -650 OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -600 OD-ZnO/C-Air-550 OD-ZnO/C-Air-600, suggesting that OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -650 has the most oxygen vacancies and OD-ZnO/C-Air-600 has the fewest. The nonstoichiometry in the OD-ZnO/C samples was further accessed by XPS, with the results shown in Fig. 5d.The peak centered at a band energy of about 528.3 eV originates from the lattice oxygen anions O 2-(O I ), whereas the peak at 529.9 eV is ascribed to surface oxygen vacancy defects (O II ).The ratio of the areas under the peaks of O II and O I are 58, 65, 37, and 20 for OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -600, OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -650, OD-ZnO/C-Air-550, and OD-ZnO/C-Air-600, indicating that OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -650 has the most surface oxygen vacancies.Both the Raman and XPS results verified a higher number of oxygen vacancies for the OD-ZnO/C-N 2 samples than for the OD-ZnO/C-Air samples.Oxygen vacancies in nonstoichiometric semiconductor photocatalysts have been reported to act as electron donors to the conduction band, and thus they are advantageous for suppressing the recombination of photoexcited electron/hole pairs and improving photocatalytic performance 45,46. Diffuse reflectance spectra of the OD-ZnO/C samples are shown in Fig. 6a.All samples exhibit a steep increase in absorption at wavelengths shorter than 400 nm, owing to the intrinsic bandgap absorption of ZnO 47.Compared to the OD-ZnO/C-Air samples, the OD-ZnO/C-N 2 samples show a gradual color change from brownish-white (OD-ZnO/C-Air-600) to grayish-black (OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -650) (inset of Fig. 6a), accompanied by considerably increased absorption in the entire UV-Vis-NIR spectrum region (300-1100 nm).The enhanced light absorption could be attributed to the narrow gap sp 2 carbon present in the carbon dots.21 Moreover, a red shift in the absorption edges suggests a reduced bandgap, which might imply the formation of chemical bonds between the OD-ZnO and carbon dots, as well as the formation of additional sub-band energy levels between the CB and VB, similar to results reported for TiO 2 -CDs and Bi 2 WO 6 -CDs heterostructures 12,20. CO 2 adsorption on the catalyst surface is important in CO 2 photoreduction.In this study, the CO 2 adsorption capacities of the samples were measured by the CO 2 physisorption technique.As Fig. 6b shows, the CO 2 adsorption capacity of the samples is in the order of OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -650 (10.36 cm 3 /g) OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -600 (7.65 cm 3 /g) OD-ZnO/C-Air-550 (7.21 cm 3 /g) OD-ZnO/C-Air-6 00 (4.90 cm 3 /g).It is generally accepted that high CO 2 adsorption by a catalyst improves subsequent catalytic reactions 48.In this regard, the highest activity of OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -600 could also be related to its high CO 2 adsorption capacity, revealing the importance of the CO 2 adsorption process in the current reaction scheme.However, we note that the photocatalytic activity of OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -650 is inferior to those of OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -600 and OD-ZnO/C-Air-550, even though they have lower CO 2 adsorption and light absorption abilities.Clearly, in this study, the CO 2 adsorption ability of the catalyst is not decisive in determining the CO 2 photoreduction efficiency. The lifetime of charge carriers vitally affects the catalytic efficiency of a photocatalytic system, and here it was captured by the time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) technique.As shown in Fig. 6c, the lifetime of photogenerated charge carriers on OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -600 was estimated to be 9.03 ns (Fig. 6c), which was approximately 2.7 times longer than that of OD-ZnO/C-Air-550 6d.All the samples respond with a steady photocurrent under Vis-NIR irradiation, and all of them produce electron/hole pairs.OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -600 exhibits the highest photocurrent intensity; in addition, it photocurrent shows a delayed decay, resulting from trapped charge carriers with prolonged lifetimes 45.Altogether, these results indicate that OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -600 has the highest charge carrier separation efficiency. We consider that the increased photocurrent density should result from the enhanced charge carrier transfer contributed by the oxygen vacancies in OD-ZnO, and to the superior conductivity contributed by the carbon dots.Previous studies showed that a high concentration electron in the oxygen vacancy defect band can absorb photons and transit to the conduction band, resulting in the improved photocurrent 23,49.Nevertheless, it was noticed that OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -650, having the highest concentration of oxygen vacancy, showed a relative lower photocurrent density than those of the OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -600 and OD-ZnO/C-Air-550.This finding clearly points out the importance to carefully control the concentration of oxygen vacancy defect in the OD-ZnO.An excessive number of oxygen vacancies may greatly increase electron scattering, and reduce the carrier mobility because of the formation of defect-related recombination centers, which rather prohibits the generation of photocurrent than to promote it 50. Moreover, the relative photocurrent density intensities are well consistent with the corresponding CO 2 reduction activity (Fig. 4a), which confirms the critical significance of the separation efficiency of charge carriers in CO 2 photoreduction.Consequently, we conclude that although the improved adsorption of CO 2 on catalyst surface is beneficial in promoting the CO 2 photoreduction, the efficiency of separation and transfer of photoexcited charge carriers plays a predominant role in determining the photoactivity in these OD-ZnO/C samples. To gain further insights into the enhanced CO 2 photoreduction properties and reaction pathway, we used in situ DRIFTS measurements.The DRIFT spectrum of the OD-ZnO/C-Air-550 after CO 2 / H 2 O adsorption in the dark is shown in Fig. 7a, which indicates four distinguishable bands at 3595, 3628, 3703, and 3728 cm A1 , which can all be assigned to hydroxyl groups from H 2 O dissociation 51.With prolonged adsorption, the intensities of these bands increase only slightly, indicating a limited number of hydroxyl groups on the OD-ZnO/C-Air-550 surface.For OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -600 (Fig. 7b), three additional new bands appear, at 3480, 3517, and 3555 cm A1 , which are reported as hydroxyl groups from H 2 O dissociation on defect sites 52.The intensities of these three bands increase progressively with time, the result of multilayer adsorption of H 2 O via H-bonding on the defect sites 51.This progressive growth considerably contributes to the high water adsorption capacity of OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -600, and was not observed when OD-ZnO/C-Air-550 was exposed to the CO 2 /H 2 O mixture. Defects in metal-based photocatalysts significantly impact the adsorption/activation energies of H 2 O 53.Previous studies showed that H 2 O dissociation is more kinetically favored on low coordination oxygen vacancy sites, leading to the formation of bridging OH species 54.Recent experimental and theoretical studies have demonstrated the important role played by oxygen vacancies in promoting the dissociation of H 2 O molecules to produce active H atoms, and also in acting as an atomic hydrogen reservoir 55.Thus, it is expected that the more oxygen vacancies on the OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -600 than on OD-ZnO/C-Air-550 are favorable in dissociating H 2 O to protons, and they also act as an atomic hydrogen reservoir that offers sufficient and readily available protons, enhancing photocatalytic activity. In the meantime, a number of bands can also be identified on both samples over the range of 1200-2000 cm A1 .The exposure of OD-ZnO/C-Air-550 to humid CO 2 in the dark causes the appearance of monodentate carbonate (m-CO 3 -, 1308 and 1495 cm A1 ), bidentate carbonate (b-CO 3 2-, 1395 cm A1 ), formate (HCOO -, 1563 and 1765 cm A1 ), and molecularly adsorbed H 2 O (1640 cm A1 ), as shown in Fig. 8a andb.When the light illumination (UV-Vis-NIR and Vis-NIR) is introduced, the intensities of all the intermediates decrease with prolonged illumination time.Compared to OD-ZnO/ C-Air-550, OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -600 exhibits dominant intermediates of bicarbonate (HCO 3 -, 1427 cm A1 ) and formate species, as depicted in Fig. 9a, b andc.An extra band at 1254 cm A1 , corresponding to CO 2 -species 38, is also observed.After saturated adsorption in the dark, illuminating OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -600 by UV-Vis-NIR (Fig. 9a) or Vis-NIR (Fig. 9b) light induces the dramatically decreased intensities of the intermediates, indicating the effective photoconversion of the surface intermediates on the OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -600 surface.In particular, the formate species almost disappear.Furthermore, one also note that under illumination of NIR light only, both the CO 2 -and formate species are still effectively consumed in comparison to that of the bicarbonate.The much faster disappearance of the CO 2 -and formate species in comparison to that of the bicarbonate clearly demonstrates its higher reactivity under light irradiation.The formation of carbon-containing intermediates varies according to the adsorption sites that interact with CO 2 36.The CO 3 2-species originates from the interaction of CO 2 with surface oxygen atoms of metal oxide through its carbon atom 3, whereas HCO 3 -is generated when a CO 2 molecule is bonded to the surface hydroxyl groups 56.It is widely recognized that one-electron reduction of CO 2 to CO 2 -critically impacts the efficiency of CO 2 photoreduction 57,58.The presence of CO 2 -species clearly indicates that one-electron reduction of CO 2 to CO 2 -can readily occur on the defect-rich surface of the OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -600.Research on defective metal oxide catalysts for CO 2 photoreduction has shown that oxygen defect sites not only provide active sites, but also inject free electrons into the adsorbed CO 2 , inducing a bent CO 2 configuration, a precursor for the formation of CO 2 -anions 59,60.Upon receiving electrons, the O-C-O angles of adsorbed CO 2 are reduced significantly on binding sites, and the more bent the geometry of the adsorbed CO 2 molecule, the easier the transfer of the electrons to CO 2 to form CO 2 -anions 59.The obtained CO 2 -is further transformed into HCOO -with the assistance of protons from H 2 O dissociation 36. Compared to carbonate species, CO 2 -and HCOO -are more active and can readily be photo-reduced to the final products when they receive sufficient numbers of electrons and protons upon light irradiation 38.Hence, the preferential formation of both CO 2 -and HCOO -species on OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -600 is considered as key to their superior photoactivities to the OD-ZnO/C-Air-550.To be more specific, the higher intensities of both HCOO -and CO 2 -bands are observed on OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -600, implying its stronger activation ability for a CO 2 /H 2 O vapor mixture, which partially explains its superior CO 2 photoreduction efficiency.Accordingly, the poor adsorption/activation ability of OD-ZnO/C-Air-550 toward CO 2 / H 2 O plausibly accounts for its lesser photoactivity.The above results clearly suggest the importance of CO 2 /H 2 O activation in determining CO 2 photoreduction efficiency.Fig. 10a shows the steady-state PL spectrum of OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -600.A strong luminescence emission at 460 nm, along with a weak emission at 560 nm are observed.The appearance of visible luminescence emissions implies the formation of defect-related energy states between the CB and VB of the OD-ZnO.According to previous studies 61,62, the emission at 460 nm is associated with the recombination of photoexcited electrons that were trapped in the defect state with the photoexcited holes in VB.The emission at 560 nm is attributed to the recombination of the photoexcited electron in CB with holes trapped in the oxygen interstitial level.Furthermore, a weak emission at 385 nm is also observed (Fig. 10a, inset), which represents the intrinsic emission from ZnO 61.Compared to the defect-induced emissions, the weak intensity of the emission at 385 indicates that high concentrations of defects were introduced in the OD-ZnO.The emission at 350 nm corresponds to the emission from the C-N 2 -600 carbon dots, as evidenced by their PL spectrum (Fig. 10b), in which peaks appear at 350, 425, 510, and 550 nm.The emission at 350 nm corresponds to the p-p transition of aromatic domains in the carbon dots, whereas the other three emissions are related to oxygencontaining surface states 21.The upconverting properties of C-N 2 -600 carbon dots was also testified by the PL technique, with results displayed in Fig. 10c.The PL spectrum of C-N 2 -600 excited by long wavelengths of 700 and 750 nm shows upconverting emissions in the range of 400-550 nm.This upconverting PL property of C-N 2 -600 is ascribed to multi-photon active processes 31, which should account for its excellent photocatalytic performance.In addition to the intrinsic defects within the OD-ZnO and C-N 2 -600 samples, their band alignment is also important in determining their interfacial charge transfer, and thus their photocatalytic activity 20.UPS spectroscopy was carried out to investigate the band structures of OD-ZnO and C-N 2 -600, with the results shown in Fig. 10d.The VB spectrum of C-N 2 -600 exhibits five main peaks, which correspond to C 2p-p, 2p-(r-p) overlap, C 2p-r, C 2 s-2p mixed state, and C 2 s state 63.The various states in the VB spectrum of C-N 2 -600 indicate different oxygen-containing functional groups on its surface, consistent with the FTIR and PL results. The work function of the samples (energy of the Fermi level with respect to vacuum) is the difference between photon energy and the energy between the secondary electron emission edge (blue circle mark) and the onset of the filled density of states (green vertical tick).The gap between the fermi level and valance band maximum is the onset of the photoemission of valence electrons (green vertical tick), using which VB position is calculated.CB minimum is calculated using the VB maximum, Fermi level, and the band gap determined from PL spectrum.With aforementioned information, the band alignment and the charge transfer between the OD-ZnO and C-N 2 -600 were obtained, as schematically shown in Fig. 10e.Considering the LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) potential of C-N 2 -600 locates above than the CB edge of OD-ZnO, giving a energy diffenrence of 0.42 eV to drive the eletron transfer from the the LUMO of C-N 2 -600 to the CB of OD-ZnO.Thus, the efficient transfer of charge carriers between OD-ZnO and C-N 2 -600 suppresses the electron-hole recombination, and contributes to the higher charge carrier density. Considering both these results and those in the literature, a possible reaction pathway for CO 2 photoreduction by H 2 O on OD-ZnO/ C-N 2 -600 is represented in Fig. 11 and described as follows.First, the hollow structure and high specific surface area of OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -600 are beneficial to the transport and adsorption of H 2 O and CO 2 molecules, which interact with various surface adsorption sites to form dissociative hydroxyl groups and several carbon intermediates.The rich surface defect sites significantly lower the reaction barriers and ensure strong adsorption and activation of CO 2 , and promote the preferential formation of CO 2 -and formate species on the OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -600.The formed species are then reduced to CO upon light irradiation, with a sufficient supply of electrons and protons from efficient charge separation and water dissociation.Note that only one electron is required for reducing CO 2 -to CO in this proposed pathway, which is energetically favored over the two-electron reduction of carbonate species to CO 64. In addition to effective adsorption/activation of the adsorbed CO 2 /H 2 O, strong light absorption and efficient charge separation are also prerequisites for achieving high photoactivity.As evidenced by the PL results, an OD-level of 0.52 eV below the CB of OD-ZnO was produced, which mediates visible-light absorption under Vis-NIR light (400 k 950 nm).On one hand, the OD-ZnO can be directly excited by incident light with energy greater than its bandgap.On the other hand, the carbon dots (C-N 2 -600) on the surface of the OD-ZnO, serving as light harvesters and converters, can absorb light with longer wavelengths (715 k 950 nm) and up-convert it into light with a shorter wavelength (400 k 550 nm), which further improves the utilization of Vis-NIR light.Under illumination with NIR only (715 k 950 nm), the carbon dots can absorb NIR light and then emit shorter wavelengths (400 k 550 nm) which excite the OD-ZnO to produce electron/hole pairs.Moreover, the proposed mechanism may also explain why the photoactivity of the OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -600 under Vis-NIR irradiation is superior to that under just NIR irradiation. Photoexcited electrons trapped in the oxygen defect state could also reduce the adsorbed CO 2 molecules because the OD-level potential (-3.82 eV with respect to vacuum) lies above the redox potential of CO 2 /CO (-3.91 eV with respect to vacuum) 65.Additionally, heterogeneous junctions formed between the OD-ZnO and C-N 2 -600 lead to more efficient interelectron transfer between the two componenets.The electrons accumulated on the surface of the OD-ZnO react with the adsorbed carbon intermediates in the presence of protons to evolve CO; concurrently, the photoexcited holes transfer to the surface of the C-N 2 -600 and trigger the oxidation of H 2 O to produce O 2 and protons 66.Hence, the co-presence of oxygen vacancy defects and carbon dots not only allows OD-ZnO/ C-N 2 -600 to utilize a wider solar spectrum, but also enables the efficient activation of CO 2 /H 2 O and suppresses the recombination of charge carriers.The end result is higher CO 2 photoreduction efficiency. The facile activation of CO 2 /H 2 O and the efficient charge separation should also enhance the photocatalytic stability of OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -600.As reported earlier, the high activity of the defect-rich catalyst surface is ascribed to the abundant oxygen vacancies at the initial stage of the reaction, but its activity decreases with prolonged reaction time if the oxygen vacancies are not effectively recovered 67.A recent theoratical study by Selloni et al. 68 showed that oxygen vacancies can be regenerated in the photo-oxidation of H 2 O by photoexcited holes created during CO 2 photoreduction with H 2 O.In this sense, the facile activation of The stability of the oxygen vacancies in our work was confirmed by the XPS analysis, as displayed in Figure S9.The signal intensities and binding energies of used OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -600 are nearly unchanged after the CO 2 photoreduction reaction, indicating that oxygen defects were well-preserved during the reaction.In our study, the surface of OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -600 is highly active for H 2 O activation, and thus it is hydroxylated owing to the defectinduced dissociative OH groups, as demonstrated in the DRIFT results (Fig. 7b).In addition, the surface intermediates on OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -600 are dominated by formate, HCO 3 -and CO 2 -, along with a certain amount of CO 3 2-(Fig.9).The formate and CO 2 -species can readily be transformed into CO by accepting sufficient quantities of electrons and protons from efficient charge separation and dissociate H 2 O 38,40, and leave the reaction sites empty for the next redox cycle.While the high stability of carbonates under photoirradiation, and its detrimental effects on CO 2 photocatalytic stability, have been commonly observed in previous studies 36,40.The accumulation of a certain amount of carbonates on the surface of OD-ZnO/C-N 2 -600 thus slowly deactivated the catalyst with prolonged reaction time, similar to results reported elsewhere 38.In contrast, for the OD-ZnO/C-Air-550, the numbers of surface hydroxyl groups are limited (Fig. 7a), and the CO 3 2-species is dominant on the surface (Fig. 8).As a result, they would occupy the surface reaction sites, and eventually resulted in the rapid photocatalytic deactivation, similar to the results elsewhere 38,39."}], "reactor type": [], "operation mode": []}}
