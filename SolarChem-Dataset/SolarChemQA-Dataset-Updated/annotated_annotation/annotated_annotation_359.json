No textural differences were found in the SEM images between the samples treated at 110 C and 130 C. The grid-like structures of the porous TiO 2 surfaces were approximately 30-50 nm in diameter and the films thicknesses were determined to be approximately 1.5 and 0.8 mm, respectively. Exposure to H 2 O 2 a well-known oxidising agent, causes a thickening gel, a mixture of titanium compounds on Ti plates, and then results in an amorphous titania layer on Ti.Many workers have studied the mechanism for the formation of TiO 2 272829.The titanium ions are in various valence states in the TiO 2 formation process and TiO 2 cannot be obtained by one-step reaction, for it is a complex process.The releasing of oxygen means that the titanium ions cannot be oxidized toTi 4 for the lack of oxygen. In order to analyse the composition of the porous films, we employed EDS to confirm the presence of Ti and O as the elemental components with oxygen deficiency (Ti:O 1:1 atomic ration) in the samples treated at 110 C and 130 C 30.The oxygen deficiency indicates the existence of oxygen vacancies (Table 1). The XRD patterns of the prepared TiO 2 films (Fig. 2) confirmed the structure formed in-situ on the Ti plates, where the prominent A (11 2) and R (0 0 2) peaks are observed.The peaks of the Ti substrate are also observed, verifying its amorphous nature 30.No obvious characteristic peaks for other impurities or phases, such as the brookite phase, were observed.The XRD patterns further indicates that the films were composed of rutile and anatase TiO 2 phases. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was employed to investigate the surface chemical bonding and electronic valence band positions of the porous TiO 2 films 18.The XPS survey spectra and the high resolution XPS spectra of the binding energies for Ti2p and O1s in the TiO 2 films obtained on Ti plates treated at 110 C and 130 C are shown in Fig. 3.As can be seen from the XPS survey spectra, there are Ti, O, and C elements in the samples, which indicates that the Ti atoms have a similar bonding environment and do not resemble the spectra of TiO 2 doped with impurities.The Ti2p3/2 core level peaks appear separately at 457.6 and 457.8 eV in the porous TiO 2 films obtained at 110 and 130 C, which conform to the 2p3/2 peaks of Ti 3 , while the Ti2p3/ 2 peak in P25 is centred at 458.5 eV, which is typical for Ti 4 A AO bonds, which has been studied by other researchers 30.The emerging Ti 3 signals suggest that oxygen vacancies were generated in TiO 2 during the simple hydrothermal treatment 12.The O1s XPS spectra of the samples treated at 110 C and 130 C show only small differences, with peaks appearing at 531.0 and 530.3 eV, respectively.The slight shift in the O1s peak is due to a peak at approximately 530.9 eV attributed to TiA AOH bonds, compared to the typical O1s peak at 529.1 eV for TiO 2 (Degussa P25) 31.The adsorbed H 2 O may also influence the shift, located at 532.5 eV 32,33. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the TiO 2 films in the region of 350-550 nm under UV excitation at around 325 nm are shown in Fig. 4 25.As is well known, when light of sufficient energy irradiates TiO 2 , the electrons will transfer from the ground state to the excited state, and the electrons in the excited state may then spontaneously emit the absorbed energy in form of light when transiting from the excited state to the ground state, indicating the fate of photo-generated electron-hole pairs 18.By measuring the wavelength and intensity of the emitted light, the corresponding PL spectra can be obtained, which may be useful for understanding the behaviour of photo-generated electron-hole pairs in our samples, since PL emission results from the recombination of excited electron-hole pairs, and therefore provides insight into the photocatalytic capabilities of the prepared TiO 2 materials.It has been reported that the PL spectra of TiO 2 materials can be attributed to three different physical origins: self-trapped excitons, oxygen vacancies and surface states 34.The PL spectra of the samples treated at 130 C and 110 C are similar but have the intensities considerably lower than that of TiO 2 (Degussa P25), indicating that the black TiO 2 samples have a lower recombination rate of electrons and holes 19.Normally, a lower recombination rate of photo-generated electron-hole pairs favours higher photocatalytic activity. The photocatalytic abilities of the porous black TiO 2 films with substantial Ti 3 and oxygen vacancies were assessed by the photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O vapour activity and simulated sunlight, and the production rates of CO and CH 4 as the representative products are plotted in Fig. 5 18.A comparison between the black TiO 2 films and commercially available TiO 2 (Degussa P25) film as a reference was also made and the porous black TiO 2 films show greatly facilitated photocatalytic activity towards the photoreduction of CO 2 , i.e. hundreds of times as much CO and CH 4 was produced by the porous black TiO 2 film compared to the reference TiO 2 (Degussa P25) film.The highest CO production rates were about 115 and 96 mmol/g h respectively and the CH 4 production rate reached peak values of 12 and 10 mmol/g h respectively and then tended to stabilize with longer irradiation times.The porous black TiO 2 films exhibited excellent photocatalytic properties, which are likely due to the improved charge transportation and separation and the extended light response region 11,31.The high surface area of the films provides more sites for photocatalysis compared to those of the bulk materials are also considered to be a reason attributable to the outstanding catalytic-efficiency of these films 35. Considering that normal TiO 2 can only partially utilize solar radiation, excluding the visible region of the spectrum, the photocatalytic capability of our samples appears to mainly be related to the oxygen vacancy defects (VO) as the active sites for photocatalysed reactions, which disorder the crystalline structure and then induce a slight band tailing resulting in a remarkable bandgap narrowing 10,18.The electrons in black TiO 2 are more efficiently excited by absorbing the simulated sunlight, due to the bandgap which is narrower than that of TiO 2 (Degussa P25), and are then transferred from the excited valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB) leaving empty spaces, which are termed photo-generated electron-hole pairs 11,17,31,36.It has been reported that the VOs lead to lattice disorder and generated localized states 17.Thus, there are two possible routes for electron transition, including directly from tailed VB to CB, and another from tailed VB to VO localized states followed by transfer to CB, which are ultimately responsible for the facilitated photocatalysis, owing to the relatively long lifetime of the photo-generated electron-hole pairs and broadened scope of spectral absorption 17. After CO 2, a very stable molecule, is adsorbed on the porous black TiO 2 film surface, it is important to discuss the basic processes occurring at the surface after absorption of photons with energy equal to or greater than the bandgap, generates photogenerated electron-hole pairs.The mechanism for the conversion of CO 2 is very complex, based on the photoreaction of CO 2 -CO and CH 4 with photo-generated electrons, and is a multi-electron transfer process instead of a single electron transfer process 7.The VOs are the active sites where the electrons can be used to form CO 2 A in the process of electronic transition and the hole can be captured by Ti 3 where Ti 4 is generated; meanwhile, an electron transfer from oxygen to Ti 4 occurs, leading to the formation of Ti 3 .Therefore, there is an electron track from oxygen to Ti 4 , which then moves to VO.In addition, the rich VOs prolong the lifetime of the photo-generated electron-hole pairs, for which the photocatalytic reaction rate is otherwise expected to be fast.bonds to form CA AH bonds, leading to the complicated intermediate reactions 7,35.According to our results as shown in Fig. 5, the prepared samples demonstrate a higher selectivity to form CO, as the maximum production rate of CH 4 appears later than that of CO.The fewer electrons and conversion steps involved suggest that the formation of CO is more favourable than that of CH 4 .Meanwhile, the combination of TiO 2 films with Ti substrate results in excellent stability of the TiO 2 films during the recycling photocatalytic reaction.The stability tests indicate the outstanding property of our samples for the reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O after exposing the samples to ambient air in the room environment for 5 days.As shown in Fig. 5(b), the mean production rates for the whole reaction process did not appear to go any obvious decrease.Thus, we can speculate that the porous black TiO 2 film samples possess stable performance and can be recyclable."}, {"llm generation": "simulated sunlight", "source": "The porous black TiO 2 films were demonstrated to be good candidates for CO 2 reduction with H 2 O vapour under irradiation by simulated sunlight with the production of CO preferred over CH 4 .", "context": "In conclusion, porous black TiO 2 films have been prepared using a simple hydrothermal treatment.The corresponding structures and properties of the TiO 2 films were analysed and characterized by different techniques: scanning electron microscopy (SEM) equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL).The results indicate that porous films were generated on the Ti substrates, being predominantly nonstoichiometric titanium oxide (TiO 2Ax ) including Ti 3 and oxygen vacancies.The porous black TiO 2 films were demonstrated to be good candidates for CO 2 reduction with H 2 O vapour under irradiation by simulated sunlight with the production of CO preferred over CH 4 .The improvement in photocatalyic yields is attributed to the rich oxygen vacancies as well as the high active surface areas of the films, which facilitate the separation of photo-generated electron-hole pairs transferring to absorbed CO 2 and provide more active sites for gas diffusion in the porous structures.
