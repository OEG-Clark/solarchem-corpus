In our dipolar binary liquid system, upon NH 3 H 2 O going through the benzene layer, water/benzene droplets are formed firstly, which has also been found in the previous literature 212223.Clearly, the chemical reaction between Zn 2 and NH 3 H 2 O happens first at the interface between the aqueous layer containing Zn 2 and the benzene layer when the droplets get there.Then, ZnO nuclei are formed at the interface of water/benzene, where the graphene is settled.It is known that the atoms on the graphene surface are usually electronegative, and Scheme 1. Schematic illustration of the growth mechanism of ZnO NAgraphene based on an idea borrowed from the liquid-liquid two-phase reaction system, which is combining the advantages of a water-in-oil emulsion method and a seed-mediated growth method. Zn 2 cations tend to absorb on its surface due to electric attraction.In a suitably weak alkaline condition, the Zn 2 cations on the graphene surface will attract the droplets containing OH -, and the ZnO nuclei will land and assemble on the graphene surface (as shown in Scheme 1).At the same time, attention should be paid to the fact that ZnO is a typical polar crystal, which usually exhibits a basal (pedion) polar oxygen plane (0001) with a top tetrahedron corner-exposed polar zinc (0001) face, and low-index faces (parallel to the c axis) consisting of a nonpolar (1000) face (and C6v symmetric ones).The above factors induced uniform and ordered dispersal of the ZnO nuclei on the graphene substrate 24252627, which has also been observed in our experiments, as shown in Fig. 2(a). It is clear that ZnO nuclei on the substrate are grown by a condensation process and have a narrow size distribution.On the other hand, this process also favors the formation of 1D array, especially for the crystal possessing anisotropic growing properties with the uniform seeds on the graphene substrate.Fig. 2(a) indicates the process of spreading out ZnO nuclei on the graphene after reaction for 30 min.Due to the ordered arrangement of ZnO seeds, a perfect nanoarray is obtained successfully under suitable reaction conditions.Moreover, the reaction process is also tracked by room temperature UV-vis absorption spectroscopy measurements, as shown in Fig. 2(b).The spectra exhibit strong absorptions from an initial wavelength of 362-382 nm with the reaction time prolonged from 30 min to 24 h, resulting from the fundamental absorption of ZnO, namely electron transition from the ground state to the excited state by UV light absorption 28,29.According to literature reports 30, the redshift of the absorption edge was related to the growth in the nanocrystal size.Our comparable results in the UV-vis absorption spectra indicate that the growth process of the ZnO nuclei accompanies the increasing size of the nanocrystal.Resulting from the presence of only one peak in the obtained UV-vis spectra, it can be concluded that the grown ZnO nanostructures exhibit good uniform crystallization and structural features 30.This providential decrease of bandgap increases the light absorption region in visible light without significantly decreasing the reducing power of electrons in ZnO NR. N 2 absorption and desorption analysis are used to further examine the porous structure of the as-obtained ZnO NAgraphene composites, and the related data are shown in Fig. S2.The isotherms feature the type IV curves with a hysteresis loop in the relatively high pressure range, which is related to the existence of mesopores structure.A distinct hysteresis loop can be observed in the range of 0.45-1.0P/P, revealing the presence of slit-like pores in the materials.The Brunauere-Emmette-Teller (BET) specific surface area of the composite (247.6 m 2 g -1 ) is higher than that of pure ZnO (32.3 m 2 g -1 ).It has been proven that the addition of graphene and an in situ growth process can decrease the aggregation of ZnO nanorods, resulting in more exposed ZnO and a special enlarged surface area.From the pore size distribution curves of the sample (inset of Fig. S2), the composites show narrower size distribution (4.25 nm).Moreover, the total pore volume of the composite increases from 0.18 cm 3 g -1 of pure ZnO to 0.38 cm 3 g -1 , indicating graphene not only increased the specific surface area of ZnO nanorods, but also increased the total pore volume, which is probably beneficial to the improvement of the photocatalytic reduction performance. The CO 2 reduction mechanism is shown in Fig. 3(a), the mechan-ism is attributed to several factors, considering that the location of the reactive site within the nanoporous structure is activated and diffusioncontrolled.Firstly, the cluster-like structure provides a more optimized geometry with significantly shorter carrier paths, avoiding the lightgenerated electron-hole pairs to travel between single nanoparticles.In addition, the graphene composite's structure is beneficial to gas molecules diffusion and electrons export.Once hole-electron pairs are generated, electrons will be immediately transferred to the surface of the graphene surface due to the shorter distance and rapidly reach the active reaction sites to combine with CO 2 molecule and H ion, which may also effectively diminish the surface recombination of charge pairs, as shown in Fig. 3(a).Secondly, compared with the pure ZnO nanoparticle counterpart, the ZnO NAgraphene composites offer more active adsorption sites and photocatalytic reaction centers, which may favor an enhanced photocatalytic activity.In the suggested graphene composite' system, graphene serves as an acceptor of electrons generated in ZnO semiconductor and effectively decreases the recombination probability of the photoexcited electron hole pairs, leaving more charge carriers to form reactive species.Thereby, ZnO NAgraphene composites have an enhanced CO 2 evolution rate under the UV-light irradiation.During the reduction process, the major reaction steps are described briefly as follows: ZnO NA/graphenehvZnO NA (h )graphene (e -) ZnO NA (2h )H 2 O1/2O 2 2H ZnO NA graphene (6e -)CO 2 6H CH 3 OHH 2 Ographene Fig. 3(b) shows the time evolution of CH 3 OH yield for pure ZnO NR and ZnO NAgraphene under UV irradiation.Pure ZnO shows relatively low CO 2 photocatalytic production yield (125 mol g cat. -1 for 3.0 h) under UV irradiation.In contrast, in the presence of graphene, the ZnO NAgraphene exhibit obviously enhanced CO 2 photocatalytic production performance.And the enhancement of CO 2 evolution is attributed to ZnO NR effectively dispersed on graphene with excellent electronic conductivity, which promote the photogenerated electron transport into the surface of graphene more easily and inhibit the recombination between photogenerated electron-hole pairs.Furthermore, the introduction of graphene with high surface area also increases the amount of exposed photocatalytic active sites, and the CH 3 OH amount yield of ZnO NAgraphene sample enhances to 375 mol g cat. -1 for 3.0 h, which is 2.81 times higher than that of pure ZnO.Additionally, the redox potentials for CO 2 reduction is close to that for the reduction of H 2 O to H 2 , the ZnO photocatalyst inevitably catalyze H 2 O to H 2 as well, as shown in Fig. 3(c). Fig. 3(d) displays the time evolution of CH 3 OH yield for pure ZnO NR and ZnO NAgraphene composites under UV irradiation.Furthermore, to investigate the photo-stability of ZnO NAgraphene, recycling experiments are also took place.As shown in Fig. 4, after nearly 10 times of consecutive recycling, the composite catalyst performance exhibits a slight decline, which is due to corroded and aggregated NRs after consecutive recycling photocatalytic process."}], "light source": [{"llm generation": "UV", "source": "Interestingly, the as-prepared ZnO nanorodgraphene composites exhibit exceedingly high activity and excellent selectivity in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 to CH 3 OH (the maximum CH 3 OH yield is 375 mol g cat.-1 for 3.0 h under UV light irradiation, which is 2.81 times as high as that on pure ZnO) as a result of the improved electron-hole pair separation rate on ZnO NAgraphene interface, as well as high light harvesting effects derived from the NAgraphene hierarchical structure.", "context": "A new two-phase solution strategy has been developed for the synthesis of hybrid one-dimensional (1D) zinc oxide nanorod arraygraphene (ZnO NAgraphene) nanostructures, in which ZnO NAgraphene were easily obtained at room temperature without using any catalysts, templates, or precursors.More importantly, an interesting formation mechanism of the 1D nanostructure in the benzene/water system and its distinctive morphology-controlling ability was discovered in this paper, respectively.Interestingly, the as-prepared ZnO nanorodgraphene composites exhibit exceedingly high activity and excellent selectivity in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 to CH 3 OH (the maximum CH 3 OH yield is 375 mol g cat.-1 for 3.0 h under UV light irradiation, which is 2.81 times as high as that on pure ZnO) as a result of the improved electron-hole pair separation rate on ZnO NAgraphene interface, as well as high light harvesting effects derived from the NAgraphene hierarchical structure."}, {"llm generation": "UV", "source": "A UV lamp (254 nm, 12 mW cm -2 ) was placed in the middle of the photo-reactor.", "context": "In our experiments, all of the chemicals were of analytical grade and were used without further purification, and ZnO NAgraphene was synthesized in a glass test tube.Typically, 2 mL, 0.05 M Zn(Ac) 2 aqueous solution was poured into the bottom of the tube.Over the Zn(Ac) 2 aqueous solution, 10 mg graphene powders (Nanjing XFNANO Materials Tech Co., Ltd) were carefully added above it.Finally, an alkaline solution (20 mL, pH value adjusted to 12.00 with 25 wt NH 3 H 2 O solution) was also carefully added into the tube as a top layer.The synthesis was proceeded at 293 K for 24 h in a static condition, and the resulting precipitate was collected by centrifugation and washed consecutively three times with distilled water and absolute ethanol, and followed by a treatment in a vacuum oven at 353 K (75.01 Torr) for 12 h.

In our dipolar binary liquid system, upon NH 3 H 2 O going through the benzene layer, water/benzene droplets are formed firstly, which has also been found in the previous literature 212223.Clearly, the chemical reaction between Zn 2 and NH 3 H 2 O happens first at the interface between the aqueous layer containing Zn 2 and the benzene layer when the droplets get there.Then, ZnO nuclei are formed at the interface of water/benzene, where the graphene is settled.It is known that the atoms on the graphene surface are usually electronegative, and Scheme 1. Schematic illustration of the growth mechanism of ZnO NAgraphene based on an idea borrowed from the liquid-liquid two-phase reaction system, which is combining the advantages of a water-in-oil emulsion method and a seed-mediated growth method. Zn 2 cations tend to absorb on its surface due to electric attraction.In a suitably weak alkaline condition, the Zn 2 cations on the graphene surface will attract the droplets containing OH -, and the ZnO nuclei will land and assemble on the graphene surface (as shown in Scheme 1).At the same time, attention should be paid to the fact that ZnO is a typical polar crystal, which usually exhibits a basal (pedion) polar oxygen plane (0001) with a top tetrahedron corner-exposed polar zinc (0001) face, and low-index faces (parallel to the c axis) consisting of a nonpolar (1000) face (and C6v symmetric ones).The above factors induced uniform and ordered dispersal of the ZnO nuclei on the graphene substrate 24252627, which has also been observed in our experiments, as shown in Fig. 2(a). It is clear that ZnO nuclei on the substrate are grown by a condensation process and have a narrow size distribution.On the other hand, this process also favors the formation of 1D array, especially for the crystal possessing anisotropic growing properties with the uniform seeds on the graphene substrate.Fig. 2(a) indicates the process of spreading out ZnO nuclei on the graphene after reaction for 30 min.Due to the ordered arrangement of ZnO seeds, a perfect nanoarray is obtained successfully under suitable reaction conditions.Moreover, the reaction process is also tracked by room temperature UV-vis absorption spectroscopy measurements, as shown in Fig. 2(b).The spectra exhibit strong absorptions from an initial wavelength of 362-382 nm with the reaction time prolonged from 30 min to 24 h, resulting from the fundamental absorption of ZnO, namely electron transition from the ground state to the excited state by UV light absorption 28,29.According to literature reports 30, the redshift of the absorption edge was related to the growth in the nanocrystal size.Our comparable results in the UV-vis absorption spectra indicate that the growth process of the ZnO nuclei accompanies the increasing size of the nanocrystal.Resulting from the presence of only one peak in the obtained UV-vis spectra, it can be concluded that the grown ZnO nanostructures exhibit good uniform crystallization and structural features 30.This providential decrease of bandgap increases the light absorption region in visible light without significantly decreasing the reducing power of electrons in ZnO NR. N 2 absorption and desorption analysis are used to further examine the porous structure of the as-obtained ZnO NAgraphene composites, and the related data are shown in Fig. S2.The isotherms feature the type IV curves with a hysteresis loop in the relatively high pressure range, which is related to the existence of mesopores structure.A distinct hysteresis loop can be observed in the range of 0.45-1.0P/P, revealing the presence of slit-like pores in the materials.The Brunauere-Emmette-Teller (BET) specific surface area of the composite (247.6 m 2 g -1 ) is higher than that of pure ZnO (32.3 m 2 g -1 ).It has been proven that the addition of graphene and an in situ growth process can decrease the aggregation of ZnO nanorods, resulting in more exposed ZnO and a special enlarged surface area.From the pore size distribution curves of the sample (inset of Fig. S2), the composites show narrower size distribution (4.25 nm).Moreover, the total pore volume of the composite increases from 0.18 cm 3 g -1 of pure ZnO to 0.38 cm 3 g -1 , indicating graphene not only increased the specific surface area of ZnO nanorods, but also increased the total pore volume, which is probably beneficial to the improvement of the photocatalytic reduction performance. The CO 2 reduction mechanism is shown in Fig. 3(a), the mechan-ism is attributed to several factors, considering that the location of the reactive site within the nanoporous structure is activated and diffusioncontrolled.Firstly, the cluster-like structure provides a more optimized geometry with significantly shorter carrier paths, avoiding the lightgenerated electron-hole pairs to travel between single nanoparticles.In addition, the graphene composite's structure is beneficial to gas molecules diffusion and electrons export.Once hole-electron pairs are generated, electrons will be immediately transferred to the surface of the graphene surface due to the shorter distance and rapidly reach the active reaction sites to combine with CO 2 molecule and H ion, which may also effectively diminish the surface recombination of charge pairs, as shown in Fig. 3(a).Secondly, compared with the pure ZnO nanoparticle counterpart, the ZnO NAgraphene composites offer more active adsorption sites and photocatalytic reaction centers, which may favor an enhanced photocatalytic activity.In the suggested graphene composite' system, graphene serves as an acceptor of electrons generated in ZnO semiconductor and effectively decreases the recombination probability of the photoexcited electron hole pairs, leaving more charge carriers to form reactive species.Thereby, ZnO NAgraphene composites have an enhanced CO 2 evolution rate under the UV-light irradiation.During the reduction process, the major reaction steps are described briefly as follows: ZnO NA/graphenehvZnO NA (h )graphene (e -) ZnO NA (2h )H 2 O1/2O 2 2H ZnO NA graphene (6e -)CO 2 6H CH 3 OHH 2 Ographene Fig. 3(b) shows the time evolution of CH 3 OH yield for pure ZnO NR and ZnO NAgraphene under UV irradiation.Pure ZnO shows relatively low CO 2 photocatalytic production yield (125 mol g cat. -1 for 3.0 h) under UV irradiation.In contrast, in the presence of graphene, the ZnO NAgraphene exhibit obviously enhanced CO 2 photocatalytic production performance.And the enhancement of CO 2 evolution is attributed to ZnO NR effectively dispersed on graphene with excellent electronic conductivity, which promote the photogenerated electron transport into the surface of graphene more easily and inhibit the recombination between photogenerated electron-hole pairs.Furthermore, the introduction of graphene with high surface area also increases the amount of exposed photocatalytic active sites, and the CH 3 OH amount yield of ZnO NAgraphene sample enhances to 375 mol g cat. -1 for 3.0 h, which is 2.81 times higher than that of pure ZnO.Additionally, the redox potentials for CO 2 reduction is close to that for the reduction of H 2 O to H 2 , the ZnO photocatalyst inevitably catalyze H 2 O to H 2 as well, as shown in Fig. 3(c). Fig. 3(d) displays the time evolution of CH 3 OH yield for pure ZnO NR and ZnO NAgraphene composites under UV irradiation.Furthermore, to investigate the photo-stability of ZnO NAgraphene, recycling experiments are also took place.As shown in Fig. 4, after nearly 10 times of consecutive recycling, the composite catalyst performance exhibits a slight decline, which is due to corroded and aggregated NRs after consecutive recycling photocatalytic process."}], "reactor type": [], "operation mode": [{"llm generation": "Batch", "source": "Before carrying out the reactions, the reactor was purged with CO 2 for 60 min and sealed at ambient pressure.", "context": "In our experiments, all of the chemicals were of analytical grade and were used without further purification, and ZnO NAgraphene was synthesized in a glass test tube.Typically, 2 mL, 0.05 M Zn(Ac) 2 aqueous solution was poured into the bottom of the tube.Over the Zn(Ac) 2 aqueous solution, 10 mg graphene powders (Nanjing XFNANO Materials Tech Co., Ltd) were carefully added above it.Finally, an alkaline solution (20 mL, pH value adjusted to 12.00 with 25 wt NH 3 H 2 O solution) was also carefully added into the tube as a top layer.The synthesis was proceeded at 293 K for 24 h in a static condition, and the resulting precipitate was collected by centrifugation and washed consecutively three times with distilled water and absolute ethanol, and followed by a treatment in a vacuum oven at 353 K (75.01 Torr) for 12 h.
