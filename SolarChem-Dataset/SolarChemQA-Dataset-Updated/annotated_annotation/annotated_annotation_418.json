Finally, ZIF-8 and ZIF-8ZIF-67 crystals are calcined by a two-step thermal treatment, thus yielding ZnO and ZnOCo 3 O 4 composite, respectively.Why did we choose the two-step thermal treatment process?Based on the TG/DTA results (Fig. S1a,b), by using the one-step calcination method in an air atmosphere, ZIF-8 started to be pyrolyzed at 300 o C and then rapidly lost weight at 373 o C, which leaded to formation of nonporous ZnO nanoparticulates (Fig. S2a).Thus, in this paper, the core-shell ZIF-8ZIF-67 crystals are thermally converted to the porous ZnOCo 3 O 4 composites via a two-step calcination.Firstly, the core-shell ZIF-8ZIF-67 crystals were pyrolyzed in a tubular furnace at 400 o C for 2 h under a N 2 atmosphere at a heating rate of 1 o C min -1 to obtain the ZnOCo 3 O 4 precursor.According to TG/DTA analysis (Fig. S1c,d), ZIF-8ZIF-67 started to be pyrolyzed at 330 o C and leaded to the slight carbonization and weight loss.We can see the colour of obtained ZnOCo 3 O 4 precursor is grey-purple, whereas the colour of ZIF-8ZIF-67 is purple.In addition, the morphology of ZnOCo 3 O 4 precursor is almost the same to ZIF-8ZIF-67 (Fig. S2b).Then, the ZnOCo 3 O 4 precursor was calcined at 400 o C for 2 h under an air atmosphere to obtain ZIF-8ZIF-67 derived ZnOCo 3 O 4 .According to the TG/DTA analysis in air atmosphere (Fig. S1e,f), the ZnOCo 3 O 4 precursor pyrolyzed slowly before 400 o C, then the organics were completely removed at 400 o C and formed the target ZnOCo 3 O 4 .Therefore, the final product ZnOCo 3 O 4 shows that the Co 3 O 4 nanoparticles were embedded on the surface of the porous ZnO polyhedra.For comparison, porous Co 3 O 4 is prepared by calcining ZIF-67 crystals, similarly to the preparation of ZnO derived from ZIF-8. The crystal structure and morphology of the prepared ZIFs are analyzed by X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD), SEM and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).As shown in Fig. 2a, the position of the diffraction peaks of the obtained ZIF-67, ZIF-8 and ZIF-8ZIF-67 crystals correspond well to the patterns simulated from the single crystal structures of ZIF-67 or ZIF-8. 32,35TEM (Fig. 2b) and SEM (Fig. 2c) images confirm that the obtained white ZIF-8 powders consist of dispersed rhombic dodecahedral crystals with a uniform size of 350 nm.After carefully dispersing ZIF-8 seeds in methanol and adding a methanolic solution of CoCl 2 and MeIm units, a crystalline shell of purple ZIF-67 is grown on the surface of the ZIF-8 seed.The core-shell structured ZIF crystals (ZIF-8ZIF-67) can also be observed on TEM elemental mapping images (Fig. 2d), revealing the layer of cobalt species homogeneously coated on the core of the zinc species.As shown in Fig. 2e andf, the size of the obtained ZIF-8ZIF-67 increases up to 450 nm, and the crystals exhibit a similar dispersity and morphology to the ZIF-8 seeds. 35cording to the XRD measurements (Fig. 3a), the calcination of ZIF-8 and ZIF-67 leads to the formation of hexagonal ZnO (JCPDS card 01-1136) and cubic Co 3 O 4 (JCPDS card 01-1152), respectively.For ZIF-8ZIF-67 crystals, the calcined product consists in a combination of a main core phase (hexagonal ZnO) and a secondary shell phase (cubic Co 3 O 4 ).X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is conducted to further ascertain the electronic configuration of the obtained compounds.Two forms of cobalt oxide, CoO and Co 3 O 4 , can be distinguished from the location of the satellite peaks from the XPS spectra. 36 shown in Fig. S3a, a low satellite peak appears at a binding energy of 789.6 eV, which is about 9.9 eV higher than the peak of Co 2p3/2 (779.7 eV) and belongs to the typical satellite peak of Co 3 O 4 . 36Because the typical satellite peak of CoO is only about 2.1 eV higher than the position of the main peak of Co 2p3/2. 37The electric states of Zn in the samples derived from ZIF-8 and ZIF-8ZIF-67 were shown in Fig. S3b, and we can see that two characteristic peaks with respect to Zn 2p 3/2 and Zn 2p 1/2 confirm the Zn 2 state of ZnO in these samples. 38From the results of XRD and XPS (Fig. 3a and Fig. S3), it demonstrates that the products derived from ZIF-67, ZIF-8 and ZIF-8ZIF-67 are Co 3 O 4 , ZnO and ZnOCo 3 O 4 , respectively. The structure and morphology of the calcined metal oxides are observed by SEM and TEM.As shown in Fig. 3b-c and Fig. S4, the obtained ZnO particles have a porous structure and retain the original rhombic dodecahedron shape from the parent ZIF-8.ZIF-8ZIF-67 crystals were thermally converted to ZnOCo 3 O 4 in the same way.Can they remain the core-shell structure (The type of A as pictured in Fig. 1)?As revealed by SEM and TEM (Fig. 3d-f and Fig. S5), the obtained ZnOCo 3 O 4 composite consists of rhombic dodecahedron-shaped porous crystals, whose surfaces are decorated with nanoparticles. According to the elemental mapping images (Fig. 3g) along with the high resolution TEM images (Fig. S5c), the rhombic dodecahedron-shaped porous crystals are composed of ZnO, while the 25 nm nanoparticles are composed of Co 3 O 4 .The results indicate that the morphology of the obtained ZnOCo 3 O 4 composite correspond to the B type pictured in Fig. 1.To assess the porosity of the as-prepared ZnOCo 3 O 4 composite, ZIF-8-derived ZnO, ZIF-67-derived Co 3 O 4 (Fig. S6), along with the commercial ZnO (Fig. S7), the N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms are acquired (Fig. S8a) and the pore size distributions (Fig. S8b) of the samples are shown.The estimated structural parameters, including the specific surface area (S BET ), total pore volume (V total ) and the average pore size, are summarized in Table S1.In general, a higher the specific surface area contains more active sites. 39,40We can clearly see from the Table S1 that the ZIFs derived metal oxides possess a higher specific surface area than that of commercial ZnO. In order to evaluate the structural advantages of the ZIFs-derived porous metal oxides for CO 2 photoreduction, the photocatalytic reaction was carried out in a gas-closed circulation system in the presence of water vapor and CO 2 .As shown in Fig. 4a andb, CO 2 is photoreduced into CH 4 and CO under UV-vis irradiation, and the amounts of CH 4 and CO generated by using ZIF-8-derived ZnO are much larger than that of the commercial ZnO and ZIF-67-derived Co 3 O 4 .After coating with Co 3 O 4 , ZnOCo 3 O 4 exhibits the highest activity among all the samples.As calculated according to how each compound evolved after 6 h (Fig. 4c), the rate of CH 4 generation using is 0.99 mol g -1 h -1 , which is about 66 times higher than the commercial ZnO (0.015 mol g -1 h -1 ) and 367 times higher than that of commercial TiO 2 (P25) (0.0027 mol g -1 h -1 ).The photocatalytic activity of ZnOCo 3 O 4 is compared with previously reported results under similar conditions (Table S2).In this study, due to the porous structural property and the effect of Co 3 O 4 as co-catalyst, a superior photocatalytic performance can be achieved.In order to explore the source of C in CH 4 and CO, contrastive experiments were performed in the dark or under light irradiation in the absence of photocatalysts, CO 2 or water, and only negligible CH 4 or CO was detected.A more exact control experiment was performed by using 13 CO 2 instead of 12 CO 2 (GC-MS are shown in Fig. S9).The main peak with a retention time from 02:50-03:45 min is confirmed to be 13 CO 2 .The two other peaks with retention times of 02:06 and 02:19 min are the main products: O 2 , CO and CH 4 .Moreover, the main organic product CO and CH 4 are verified to be 13 CO and 13 CH 4 . Therefore, the results of the above experiments demonstrate that the source of C in CH 4 and CO was generated from CO 2 through a photocatalytic process. In order to study how the calcination temperature affects the photocatalytic activity, we prepared ZnOCo 3 O 4 in different temperature (400, 500 and 600 o C).In general, the size of the ZnO grain increases with the calcination temperature.As expected, the average crystalline sizes of ZnO in ZnOCo 3 O 4 -400, ZnOCo 3 O 4 -500, and ZnOCo 3 O 4 -600 estimated from Scherrer equation (D k/cos) via XRD (Fig. S10) are 12.0, 22.1 and 40.2 nm, respectively, which is in good agreement with the results of TEM images (Fig. S5c andS11).That is to say, as the calcination temperature increases, the crystalline sizes increase and lead to the structural collapse of the porous rhombic dodecahedron.In the end, the specific surface area reduces and the pore size distribution weakens or disappears (Fig. S12).As we know, the larger the specific surface area of photocatalysts, the higher the photocatalytic activity. 12,13,41g. S13 clearly shows that CO 2 is photoreduced to CH 4 and CO under UV-vis light, and the generated rate of products decreases with the increased calcination temperature.Therefore, the sequence of photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction is ZnOCo 3 O 4 -400 ZnOCo 3 O 4 -500 ZnOCo 3 O 4 -600, in accordance with the specific surface area. Further investigating the photocatalytic stability is necessary.As shown in Fig. 4a andb, the CO evolution of the ZIF-8-derived ZnO is stable, while the CH 4 evolution slows down after 7 h.When the ZnO is coated with Co 3 O 4 nanoparticles, the stability is enhanced (Fig. 4b).One could wonder why ZnOCo 3 O 4 possesses better photocatalytic stability than the ZnO.It is well known that photocorrosion of ZnO, which reduces the photocatalytic stability of ZnO, occurs easily.The changes in the main phase composition and in the structure caused by the photocatalytic reaction are investigated by XRD, XPS and TEM.Before the photocatalytic reaction (Fig. 5a andb), the commercial ZnO and the ZIF-8-derived ZnO have a hexagonal ZnO crystal structure (JCPDS card 01-1136), while after, both of them have a rhombohedral ZnCO 3 structure (JCPDS card 03-0774).In the case of ZnOCo 3 O 4 , there is no obvious change after the photocatalytic reaction (Fig. 5c).The C 1s XPS patterns (Fig. 5d-f) of the samples also show that CO 3 2-(289 eV) is present in both the commercial ZnO and ZIF-8-derived ZnO, but cannot be detected in the ZnOCo 3 O 4 after the photocatalytic reaction. Furthermore, we observe by TEM a change in the morphology of ZnO and ZnOCo 3 O 4 following the photocatalytic reaction (Fig. 6a-d).The TEM images show that the morphology of ZnO has been destroyed, while the morphology of ZnOCo 3 O 4 is well-retained.The proposed ideal reaction equations for the photoreduction of CO 2 by ZnO under UV-vis irradiation are depicted in Fig. S14a (1, 2, 3).XRD and XPS analysis suggest, however, the appearance of ZnCO 3 (Fig. 5) and the instability of the CH 4 evolution (Fig. 4b) after the photocatalytic reaction.That is to say, the photocorrosion of ZnO occurs and the actual reaction equations are as presented in Fig. S14a (1, 4, 5), which result in the instability of the CH 4 evolution.On the other hand, there is no obvious change after the photocatalytic reaction for the ZnOCo 3 O 4 , indicating that the reaction equations for the photoreduction of CO 2 with"}, {"llm generation": "ZnO", "source": "The proposed ideal reaction equations for the photoreduction of CO 2 by ZnO under UV-vis irradiation are depicted in Fig. S14a (1, 2, 3).", "context": "The designed schematic route for fabricating ZIFs-derived ZnO and ZnOCo 3 O 4 composite is described in Fig. 1.Core-shell structured ZIF-8ZIF-67 crystals are prepared through solvothermal method.Firstly, ZIF-8 is prepared at room temperature through a coordination reaction between zinc ions and 2-methylimidazole. 32Then, the ZIF-8 seeds are coated with ZIF-67 by a solvothermal process to form the core-shell ZIF-8ZIF-67 crystals, in which each single Zn 2 or Co 2 ion is connected with four 2-methylimidazole molecules. 35In order to further assess the core-shell structure of ZIF-8ZIF-67, low-voltage high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image and elemental mapping analysis are performed (Fig. 1), showing that the surface of Zn-based material is coated with a Co-based material. Finally, ZIF-8 and ZIF-8ZIF-67 crystals are calcined by a two-step thermal treatment, thus yielding ZnO and ZnOCo 3 O 4 composite, respectively.Why did we choose the two-step thermal treatment process?Based on the TG/DTA results (Fig. S1a,b), by using the one-step calcination method in an air atmosphere, ZIF-8 started to be pyrolyzed at 300 o C and then rapidly lost weight at 373 o C, which leaded to formation of nonporous ZnO nanoparticulates (Fig. S2a).Thus, in this paper, the core-shell ZIF-8ZIF-67 crystals are thermally converted to the porous ZnOCo 3 O 4 composites via a two-step calcination.Firstly, the core-shell ZIF-8ZIF-67 crystals were pyrolyzed in a tubular furnace at 400 o C for 2 h under a N 2 atmosphere at a heating rate of 1 o C min -1 to obtain the ZnOCo 3 O 4 precursor.According to TG/DTA analysis (Fig. S1c,d), ZIF-8ZIF-67 started to be pyrolyzed at 330 o C and leaded to the slight carbonization and weight loss.We can see the colour of obtained ZnOCo 3 O 4 precursor is grey-purple, whereas the colour of ZIF-8ZIF-67 is purple.In addition, the morphology of ZnOCo 3 O 4 precursor is almost the same to ZIF-8ZIF-67 (Fig. S2b).Then, the ZnOCo 3 O 4 precursor was calcined at 400 o C for 2 h under an air atmosphere to obtain ZIF-8ZIF-67 derived ZnOCo 3 O 4 .According to the TG/DTA analysis in air atmosphere (Fig. S1e,f), the ZnOCo 3 O 4 precursor pyrolyzed slowly before 400 o C, then the organics were completely removed at 400 o C and formed the target ZnOCo 3 O 4 .Therefore, the final product ZnOCo 3 O 4 shows that the Co 3 O 4 nanoparticles were embedded on the surface of the porous ZnO polyhedra.For comparison, porous Co 3 O 4 is prepared by calcining ZIF-67 crystals, similarly to the preparation of ZnO derived from ZIF-8. The crystal structure and morphology of the prepared ZIFs are analyzed by X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD), SEM and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).As shown in Fig. 2a, the position of the diffraction peaks of the obtained ZIF-67, ZIF-8 and ZIF-8ZIF-67 crystals correspond well to the patterns simulated from the single crystal structures of ZIF-67 or ZIF-8. 32,35TEM (Fig. 2b) and SEM (Fig. 2c) images confirm that the obtained white ZIF-8 powders consist of dispersed rhombic dodecahedral crystals with a uniform size of 350 nm.After carefully dispersing ZIF-8 seeds in methanol and adding a methanolic solution of CoCl 2 and MeIm units, a crystalline shell of purple ZIF-67 is grown on the surface of the ZIF-8 seed.The core-shell structured ZIF crystals (ZIF-8ZIF-67) can also be observed on TEM elemental mapping images (Fig. 2d), revealing the layer of cobalt species homogeneously coated on the core of the zinc species.As shown in Fig. 2e andf, the size of the obtained ZIF-8ZIF-67 increases up to 450 nm, and the crystals exhibit a similar dispersity and morphology to the ZIF-8 seeds. 35cording to the XRD measurements (Fig. 3a), the calcination of ZIF-8 and ZIF-67 leads to the formation of hexagonal ZnO (JCPDS card 01-1136) and cubic Co 3 O 4 (JCPDS card 01-1152), respectively.For ZIF-8ZIF-67 crystals, the calcined product consists in a combination of a main core phase (hexagonal ZnO) and a secondary shell phase (cubic Co 3 O 4 ).X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is conducted to further ascertain the electronic configuration of the obtained compounds.Two forms of cobalt oxide, CoO and Co 3 O 4 , can be distinguished from the location of the satellite peaks from the XPS spectra. 36 shown in Fig. S3a, a low satellite peak appears at a binding energy of 789.6 eV, which is about 9.9 eV higher than the peak of Co 2p3/2 (779.7 eV) and belongs to the typical satellite peak of Co 3 O 4 . 36Because the typical satellite peak of CoO is only about 2.1 eV higher than the position of the main peak of Co 2p3/2. 37The electric states of Zn in the samples derived from ZIF-8 and ZIF-8ZIF-67 were shown in Fig. S3b, and we can see that two characteristic peaks with respect to Zn 2p 3/2 and Zn 2p 1/2 confirm the Zn 2 state of ZnO in these samples. 38From the results of XRD and XPS (Fig. 3a and Fig. S3), it demonstrates that the products derived from ZIF-67, ZIF-8 and ZIF-8ZIF-67 are Co 3 O 4 , ZnO and ZnOCo 3 O 4 , respectively. The structure and morphology of the calcined metal oxides are observed by SEM and TEM.As shown in Fig. 3b-c and Fig. S4, the obtained ZnO particles have a porous structure and retain the original rhombic dodecahedron shape from the parent ZIF-8.ZIF-8ZIF-67 crystals were thermally converted to ZnOCo 3 O 4 in the same way.Can they remain the core-shell structure (The type of A as pictured in Fig. 1)?As revealed by SEM and TEM (Fig. 3d-f and Fig. S5), the obtained ZnOCo 3 O 4 composite consists of rhombic dodecahedron-shaped porous crystals, whose surfaces are decorated with nanoparticles. According to the elemental mapping images (Fig. 3g) along with the high resolution TEM images (Fig. S5c), the rhombic dodecahedron-shaped porous crystals are composed of ZnO, while the 25 nm nanoparticles are composed of Co 3 O 4 .The results indicate that the morphology of the obtained ZnOCo 3 O 4 composite correspond to the B type pictured in Fig. 1.To assess the porosity of the as-prepared ZnOCo 3 O 4 composite, ZIF-8-derived ZnO, ZIF-67-derived Co 3 O 4 (Fig. S6), along with the commercial ZnO (Fig. S7), the N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms are acquired (Fig. S8a) and the pore size distributions (Fig. S8b) of the samples are shown.The estimated structural parameters, including the specific surface area (S BET ), total pore volume (V total ) and the average pore size, are summarized in Table S1.In general, a higher the specific surface area contains more active sites. 39,40We can clearly see from the Table S1 that the ZIFs derived metal oxides possess a higher specific surface area than that of commercial ZnO. In order to evaluate the structural advantages of the ZIFs-derived porous metal oxides for CO 2 photoreduction, the photocatalytic reaction was carried out in a gas-closed circulation system in the presence of water vapor and CO 2 .As shown in Fig. 4a andb, CO 2 is photoreduced into CH 4 and CO under UV-vis irradiation, and the amounts of CH 4 and CO generated by using ZIF-8-derived ZnO are much larger than that of the commercial ZnO and ZIF-67-derived Co 3 O 4 .After coating with Co 3 O 4 , ZnOCo 3 O 4 exhibits the highest activity among all the samples.As calculated according to how each compound evolved after 6 h (Fig. 4c), the rate of CH 4 generation using is 0.99 mol g -1 h -1 , which is about 66 times higher than the commercial ZnO (0.015 mol g -1 h -1 ) and 367 times higher than that of commercial TiO 2 (P25) (0.0027 mol g -1 h -1 ).The photocatalytic activity of ZnOCo 3 O 4 is compared with previously reported results under similar conditions (Table S2).In this study, due to the porous structural property and the effect of Co 3 O 4 as co-catalyst, a superior photocatalytic performance can be achieved.In order to explore the source of C in CH 4 and CO, contrastive experiments were performed in the dark or under light irradiation in the absence of photocatalysts, CO 2 or water, and only negligible CH 4 or CO was detected.A more exact control experiment was performed by using 13 CO 2 instead of 12 CO 2 (GC-MS are shown in Fig. S9).The main peak with a retention time from 02:50-03:45 min is confirmed to be 13 CO 2 .The two other peaks with retention times of 02:06 and 02:19 min are the main products: O 2 , CO and CH 4 .Moreover, the main organic product CO and CH 4 are verified to be 13 CO and 13 CH 4 . Therefore, the results of the above experiments demonstrate that the source of C in CH 4 and CO was generated from CO 2 through a photocatalytic process. In order to study how the calcination temperature affects the photocatalytic activity, we prepared ZnOCo 3 O 4 in different temperature (400, 500 and 600 o C).In general, the size of the ZnO grain increases with the calcination temperature.As expected, the average crystalline sizes of ZnO in ZnOCo 3 O 4 -400, ZnOCo 3 O 4 -500, and ZnOCo 3 O 4 -600 estimated from Scherrer equation (D k/cos) via XRD (Fig. S10) are 12.0, 22.1 and 40.2 nm, respectively, which is in good agreement with the results of TEM images (Fig. S5c andS11).That is to say, as the calcination temperature increases, the crystalline sizes increase and lead to the structural collapse of the porous rhombic dodecahedron.In the end, the specific surface area reduces and the pore size distribution weakens or disappears (Fig. S12).As we know, the larger the specific surface area of photocatalysts, the higher the photocatalytic activity. 12,13,41g. S13 clearly shows that CO 2 is photoreduced to CH 4 and CO under UV-vis light, and the generated rate of products decreases with the increased calcination temperature.Therefore, the sequence of photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction is ZnOCo 3 O 4 -400 ZnOCo 3 O 4 -500 ZnOCo 3 O 4 -600, in accordance with the specific surface area. Further investigating the photocatalytic stability is necessary.As shown in Fig. 4a andb, the CO evolution of the ZIF-8-derived ZnO is stable, while the CH 4 evolution slows down after 7 h.When the ZnO is coated with Co 3 O 4 nanoparticles, the stability is enhanced (Fig. 4b).One could wonder why ZnOCo 3 O 4 possesses better photocatalytic stability than the ZnO.It is well known that photocorrosion of ZnO, which reduces the photocatalytic stability of ZnO, occurs easily.The changes in the main phase composition and in the structure caused by the photocatalytic reaction are investigated by XRD, XPS and TEM.Before the photocatalytic reaction (Fig. 5a andb), the commercial ZnO and the ZIF-8-derived ZnO have a hexagonal ZnO crystal structure (JCPDS card 01-1136), while after, both of them have a rhombohedral ZnCO 3 structure (JCPDS card 03-0774).In the case of ZnOCo 3 O 4 , there is no obvious change after the photocatalytic reaction (Fig. 5c).The C 1s XPS patterns (Fig. 5d-f) of the samples also show that CO 3 2-(289 eV) is present in both the commercial ZnO and ZIF-8-derived ZnO, but cannot be detected in the ZnOCo 3 O 4 after the photocatalytic reaction. Furthermore, we observe by TEM a change in the morphology of ZnO and ZnOCo 3 O 4 following the photocatalytic reaction (Fig. 6a-d).The TEM images show that the morphology of ZnO has been destroyed, while the morphology of ZnOCo 3 O 4 is well-retained.The proposed ideal reaction equations for the photoreduction of CO 2 by ZnO under UV-vis irradiation are depicted in Fig. S14a (1, 2, 3).XRD and XPS analysis suggest, however, the appearance of ZnCO 3 (Fig. 5) and the instability of the CH 4 evolution (Fig. 4b) after the photocatalytic reaction.That is to say, the photocorrosion of ZnO occurs and the actual reaction equations are as presented in Fig. S14a (1, 4, 5), which result in the instability of the CH 4 evolution.On the other hand, there is no obvious change after the photocatalytic reaction for the ZnOCo 3 O 4 , indicating that the reaction equations for the photoreduction of CO 2 with"}, {"llm generation": "ZnOCo 3 O 4", "source": "The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 shows that the advantageous porous structure of ZnOCo 3 O 4 and the co-catalytic properties of ZnO coated with Co 3 O 4 can lead to a superior photocatalytic performance.", "context": "We have designed a convenient approach to prepare a novel porous ZnOCo 3 O 4 composite by using core-shell ZIF-8ZIF-67 crystals as the precursor, and by combining a seed-mediated solvothermal process with a two-step calcination.The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 shows that the advantageous porous structure of ZnOCo 3 O 4 and the co-catalytic properties of ZnO coated with Co 3 O 4 can lead to a superior photocatalytic performance.The generated rate of CH 4 over ZnOCo 3 O 4 is 0.99 mol g -1 h -1 , which is about 66 times higher than the commercial ZnO and 367 times higher than that of commercial TiO 2 (P25 The common ZIFs, such as rhombic dodecahedral ZIF-67 (Co(2-methylimidazole) 2 n , space group I-43m, a 16.9589(3)A, 90; b 16.9589(3)A, 90; c 16.9589(3)A, 90) and ZIF-8 (Zn(2-methylimidazole) 2 n , space group I-43m, a 16.9910(12)A, 90; b 16.9910(12) Published on 22 February 2016.Downloaded by Purdue University on 23/02/2016 05:11:29.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on an X-ray diffractometer (Rint 2000, Altima III, Rigaku Co. Japan) using a Cu K 1 source.Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms were measured at 77 K by using a BEL SORP-mini II (BEL Japan INC., Japan). The specific surface area of the photocatalysts was calculated by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method, and the total pore volume and the distributions were estimated by the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method through the adsorption branch.The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis was conducted with a field-emission TEM (2100F, JEOL Co., Japan) operating at 200 kV.An energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX) installed in a 2100F was used to analyze the microzone composition (STEM-EDX mapping).The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were recorded on a field-emission SEM (S4800, Hitachi Co., Japan) with an acceleration voltage of 10 kV.The low voltage high resolution SEM images of the fine structures were taken with the in-column detector of a JEOL JSM-7800F GBSH.The elemental chemical analysis of the samples was performed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, PHI Quantera SXM, ULVAC-PHI Inc., Japan).Weight changes were monitored by using a TG/DTA instrument (DTG-60HDTA-TG, Shimadzu Co., Japan) from room temperature to 800 o C under N 2 or air with a heating rate of All the photocatalysts were treated at 400 o C in O 2 for 4 h to remove organic adsorbates before the photoreduction of CO 2 .In detail: A 300 W xenon arc lamp was used as the light source; 0.1 g of the photocatalyst was uniformly dispersed on a porous quartzose film in a reaction cell, and 3 mL of deionized H 2 O and 80 KPa pure CO 2 gas were added into an airtight circulation system.The gaseous products were measured by using a gas chromatograph (GC-14B, Shimadzu Co., Japan).The isotope analysis of 13 C was carried out by using a gas chromatographmass spectrum (JEOL-GCQMS, JMS-K9 and 6890N Network GC system, Agilent Technologies)."}, {"llm generation": "UV-vis irradiation", "source": "As shown in Fig. 4a andb, CO 2 is photoreduced into CH 4 and CO under UV-vis irradiation, and the amounts of CH 4 and CO generated by using ZIF-8-derived ZnO are much larger than that of the commercial ZnO and ZIF-67-derived Co 3 O 4 .", "context": "The designed schematic route for fabricating ZIFs-derived ZnO and ZnOCo 3 O 4 composite is described in Fig. 1.Core-shell structured ZIF-8ZIF-67 crystals are prepared through solvothermal method.Firstly, ZIF-8 is prepared at room temperature through a coordination reaction between zinc ions and 2-methylimidazole. 32Then, the ZIF-8 seeds are coated with ZIF-67 by a solvothermal process to form the core-shell ZIF-8ZIF-67 crystals, in which each single Zn 2 or Co 2 ion is connected with four 2-methylimidazole molecules. 35In order to further assess the core-shell structure of ZIF-8ZIF-67, low-voltage high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image and elemental mapping analysis are performed (Fig. 1), showing that the surface of Zn-based material is coated with a Co-based material. Finally, ZIF-8 and ZIF-8ZIF-67 crystals are calcined by a two-step thermal treatment, thus yielding ZnO and ZnOCo 3 O 4 composite, respectively.Why did we choose the two-step thermal treatment process?Based on the TG/DTA results (Fig. S1a,b), by using the one-step calcination method in an air atmosphere, ZIF-8 started to be pyrolyzed at 300 o C and then rapidly lost weight at 373 o C, which leaded to formation of nonporous ZnO nanoparticulates (Fig. S2a).Thus, in this paper, the core-shell ZIF-8ZIF-67 crystals are thermally converted to the porous ZnOCo 3 O 4 composites via a two-step calcination.Firstly, the core-shell ZIF-8ZIF-67 crystals were pyrolyzed in a tubular furnace at 400 o C for 2 h under a N 2 atmosphere at a heating rate of 1 o C min -1 to obtain the ZnOCo 3 O 4 precursor.According to TG/DTA analysis (Fig. S1c,d), ZIF-8ZIF-67 started to be pyrolyzed at 330 o C and leaded to the slight carbonization and weight loss.We can see the colour of obtained ZnOCo 3 O 4 precursor is grey-purple, whereas the colour of ZIF-8ZIF-67 is purple.In addition, the morphology of ZnOCo 3 O 4 precursor is almost the same to ZIF-8ZIF-67 (Fig. S2b).Then, the ZnOCo 3 O 4 precursor was calcined at 400 o C for 2 h under an air atmosphere to obtain ZIF-8ZIF-67 derived ZnOCo 3 O 4 .According to the TG/DTA analysis in air atmosphere (Fig. S1e,f), the ZnOCo 3 O 4 precursor pyrolyzed slowly before 400 o C, then the organics were completely removed at 400 o C and formed the target ZnOCo 3 O 4 .Therefore, the final product ZnOCo 3 O 4 shows that the Co 3 O 4 nanoparticles were embedded on the surface of the porous ZnO polyhedra.For comparison, porous Co 3 O 4 is prepared by calcining ZIF-67 crystals, similarly to the preparation of ZnO derived from ZIF-8. The crystal structure and morphology of the prepared ZIFs are analyzed by X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD), SEM and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).As shown in Fig. 2a, the position of the diffraction peaks of the obtained ZIF-67, ZIF-8 and ZIF-8ZIF-67 crystals correspond well to the patterns simulated from the single crystal structures of ZIF-67 or ZIF-8. 32,35TEM (Fig. 2b) and SEM (Fig. 2c) images confirm that the obtained white ZIF-8 powders consist of dispersed rhombic dodecahedral crystals with a uniform size of 350 nm.After carefully dispersing ZIF-8 seeds in methanol and adding a methanolic solution of CoCl 2 and MeIm units, a crystalline shell of purple ZIF-67 is grown on the surface of the ZIF-8 seed.The core-shell structured ZIF crystals (ZIF-8ZIF-67) can also be observed on TEM elemental mapping images (Fig. 2d), revealing the layer of cobalt species homogeneously coated on the core of the zinc species.As shown in Fig. 2e andf, the size of the obtained ZIF-8ZIF-67 increases up to 450 nm, and the crystals exhibit a similar dispersity and morphology to the ZIF-8 seeds. 35cording to the XRD measurements (Fig. 3a), the calcination of ZIF-8 and ZIF-67 leads to the formation of hexagonal ZnO (JCPDS card 01-1136) and cubic Co 3 O 4 (JCPDS card 01-1152), respectively.For ZIF-8ZIF-67 crystals, the calcined product consists in a combination of a main core phase (hexagonal ZnO) and a secondary shell phase (cubic Co 3 O 4 ).X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is conducted to further ascertain the electronic configuration of the obtained compounds.Two forms of cobalt oxide, CoO and Co 3 O 4 , can be distinguished from the location of the satellite peaks from the XPS spectra. 36 shown in Fig. S3a, a low satellite peak appears at a binding energy of 789.6 eV, which is about 9.9 eV higher than the peak of Co 2p3/2 (779.7 eV) and belongs to the typical satellite peak of Co 3 O 4 . 36Because the typical satellite peak of CoO is only about 2.1 eV higher than the position of the main peak of Co 2p3/2. 37The electric states of Zn in the samples derived from ZIF-8 and ZIF-8ZIF-67 were shown in Fig. S3b, and we can see that two characteristic peaks with respect to Zn 2p 3/2 and Zn 2p 1/2 confirm the Zn 2 state of ZnO in these samples. 38From the results of XRD and XPS (Fig. 3a and Fig. S3), it demonstrates that the products derived from ZIF-67, ZIF-8 and ZIF-8ZIF-67 are Co 3 O 4 , ZnO and ZnOCo 3 O 4 , respectively. The structure and morphology of the calcined metal oxides are observed by SEM and TEM.As shown in Fig. 3b-c and Fig. S4, the obtained ZnO particles have a porous structure and retain the original rhombic dodecahedron shape from the parent ZIF-8.ZIF-8ZIF-67 crystals were thermally converted to ZnOCo 3 O 4 in the same way.Can they remain the core-shell structure (The type of A as pictured in Fig. 1)?As revealed by SEM and TEM (Fig. 3d-f and Fig. S5), the obtained ZnOCo 3 O 4 composite consists of rhombic dodecahedron-shaped porous crystals, whose surfaces are decorated with nanoparticles. According to the elemental mapping images (Fig. 3g) along with the high resolution TEM images (Fig. S5c), the rhombic dodecahedron-shaped porous crystals are composed of ZnO, while the 25 nm nanoparticles are composed of Co 3 O 4 .The results indicate that the morphology of the obtained ZnOCo 3 O 4 composite correspond to the B type pictured in Fig. 1.To assess the porosity of the as-prepared ZnOCo 3 O 4 composite, ZIF-8-derived ZnO, ZIF-67-derived Co 3 O 4 (Fig. S6), along with the commercial ZnO (Fig. S7), the N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms are acquired (Fig. S8a) and the pore size distributions (Fig. S8b) of the samples are shown.The estimated structural parameters, including the specific surface area (S BET ), total pore volume (V total ) and the average pore size, are summarized in Table S1.In general, a higher the specific surface area contains more active sites. 39,40We can clearly see from the Table S1 that the ZIFs derived metal oxides possess a higher specific surface area than that of commercial ZnO. In order to evaluate the structural advantages of the ZIFs-derived porous metal oxides for CO 2 photoreduction, the photocatalytic reaction was carried out in a gas-closed circulation system in the presence of water vapor and CO 2 .As shown in Fig. 4a andb, CO 2 is photoreduced into CH 4 and CO under UV-vis irradiation, and the amounts of CH 4 and CO generated by using ZIF-8-derived ZnO are much larger than that of the commercial ZnO and ZIF-67-derived Co 3 O 4 .After coating with Co 3 O 4 , ZnOCo 3 O 4 exhibits the highest activity among all the samples.As calculated according to how each compound evolved after 6 h (Fig. 4c), the rate of CH 4 generation using is 0.99 mol g -1 h -1 , which is about 66 times higher than the commercial ZnO (0.015 mol g -1 h -1 ) and 367 times higher than that of commercial TiO 2 (P25) (0.0027 mol g -1 h -1 ).The photocatalytic activity of ZnOCo 3 O 4 is compared with previously reported results under similar conditions (Table S2).In this study, due to the porous structural property and the effect of Co 3 O 4 as co-catalyst, a superior photocatalytic performance can be achieved.In order to explore the source of C in CH 4 and CO, contrastive experiments were performed in the dark or under light irradiation in the absence of photocatalysts, CO 2 or water, and only negligible CH 4 or CO was detected.A more exact control experiment was performed by using 13 CO 2 instead of 12 CO 2 (GC-MS are shown in Fig. S9).The main peak with a retention time from 02:50-03:45 min is confirmed to be 13 CO 2 .The two other peaks with retention times of 02:06 and 02:19 min are the main products: O 2 , CO and CH 4 .Moreover, the main organic product CO and CH 4 are verified to be 13 CO and 13 CH 4 . Therefore, the results of the above experiments demonstrate that the source of C in CH 4 and CO was generated from CO 2 through a photocatalytic process. In order to study how the calcination temperature affects the photocatalytic activity, we prepared ZnOCo 3 O 4 in different temperature (400, 500 and 600 o C).In general, the size of the ZnO grain increases with the calcination temperature.As expected, the average crystalline sizes of ZnO in ZnOCo 3 O 4 -400, ZnOCo 3 O 4 -500, and ZnOCo 3 O 4 -600 estimated from Scherrer equation (D k/cos) via XRD (Fig. S10) are 12.0, 22.1 and 40.2 nm, respectively, which is in good agreement with the results of TEM images (Fig. S5c andS11).That is to say, as the calcination temperature increases, the crystalline sizes increase and lead to the structural collapse of the porous rhombic dodecahedron.In the end, the specific surface area reduces and the pore size distribution weakens or disappears (Fig. S12).As we know, the larger the specific surface area of photocatalysts, the higher the photocatalytic activity. 12,13,41g. S13 clearly shows that CO 2 is photoreduced to CH 4 and CO under UV-vis light, and the generated rate of products decreases with the increased calcination temperature.Therefore, the sequence of photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction is ZnOCo 3 O 4 -400 ZnOCo 3 O 4 -500 ZnOCo 3 O 4 -600, in accordance with the specific surface area. Further investigating the photocatalytic stability is necessary.As shown in Fig. 4a andb, the CO evolution of the ZIF-8-derived ZnO is stable, while the CH 4 evolution slows down after 7 h.When the ZnO is coated with Co 3 O 4 nanoparticles, the stability is enhanced (Fig. 4b).One could wonder why ZnOCo 3 O 4 possesses better photocatalytic stability than the ZnO.It is well known that photocorrosion of ZnO, which reduces the photocatalytic stability of ZnO, occurs easily.The changes in the main phase composition and in the structure caused by the photocatalytic reaction are investigated by XRD, XPS and TEM.Before the photocatalytic reaction (Fig. 5a andb), the commercial ZnO and the ZIF-8-derived ZnO have a hexagonal ZnO crystal structure (JCPDS card 01-1136), while after, both of them have a rhombohedral ZnCO 3 structure (JCPDS card 03-0774).In the case of ZnOCo 3 O 4 , there is no obvious change after the photocatalytic reaction (Fig. 5c).The C 1s XPS patterns (Fig. 5d-f) of the samples also show that CO 3 2-(289 eV) is present in both the commercial ZnO and ZIF-8-derived ZnO, but cannot be detected in the ZnOCo 3 O 4 after the photocatalytic reaction. Furthermore, we observe by TEM a change in the morphology of ZnO and ZnOCo 3 O 4 following the photocatalytic reaction (Fig. 6a-d).The TEM images show that the morphology of ZnO has been destroyed, while the morphology of ZnOCo 3 O 4 is well-retained.The proposed ideal reaction equations for the photoreduction of CO 2 by ZnO under UV-vis irradiation are depicted in Fig. S14a (1, 2, 3).XRD and XPS analysis suggest, however, the appearance of ZnCO 3 (Fig. 5) and the instability of the CH 4 evolution (Fig. 4b) after the photocatalytic reaction.That is to say, the photocorrosion of ZnO occurs and the actual reaction equations are as presented in Fig. S14a (1, 4, 5), which result in the instability of the CH 4 evolution.On the other hand, there is no obvious change after the photocatalytic reaction for the ZnOCo 3 O 4 , indicating that the reaction equations for the photoreduction of CO 2 with"}, {"llm generation": "UV-vis light", "source": "12,13,41g.

Finally, ZIF-8 and ZIF-8ZIF-67 crystals are calcined by a two-step thermal treatment, thus yielding ZnO and ZnOCo 3 O 4 composite, respectively.Why did we choose the two-step thermal treatment process?Based on the TG/DTA results (Fig. S1a,b), by using the one-step calcination method in an air atmosphere, ZIF-8 started to be pyrolyzed at 300 o C and then rapidly lost weight at 373 o C, which leaded to formation of nonporous ZnO nanoparticulates (Fig. S2a).Thus, in this paper, the core-shell ZIF-8ZIF-67 crystals are thermally converted to the porous ZnOCo 3 O 4 composites via a two-step calcination.Firstly, the core-shell ZIF-8ZIF-67 crystals were pyrolyzed in a tubular furnace at 400 o C for 2 h under a N 2 atmosphere at a heating rate of 1 o C min -1 to obtain the ZnOCo 3 O 4 precursor.According to TG/DTA analysis (Fig. S1c,d), ZIF-8ZIF-67 started to be pyrolyzed at 330 o C and leaded to the slight carbonization and weight loss.We can see the colour of obtained ZnOCo 3 O 4 precursor is grey-purple, whereas the colour of ZIF-8ZIF-67 is purple.In addition, the morphology of ZnOCo 3 O 4 precursor is almost the same to ZIF-8ZIF-67 (Fig. S2b).Then, the ZnOCo 3 O 4 precursor was calcined at 400 o C for 2 h under an air atmosphere to obtain ZIF-8ZIF-67 derived ZnOCo 3 O 4 .According to the TG/DTA analysis in air atmosphere (Fig. S1e,f), the ZnOCo 3 O 4 precursor pyrolyzed slowly before 400 o C, then the organics were completely removed at 400 o C and formed the target ZnOCo 3 O 4 .Therefore, the final product ZnOCo 3 O 4 shows that the Co 3 O 4 nanoparticles were embedded on the surface of the porous ZnO polyhedra.For comparison, porous Co 3 O 4 is prepared by calcining ZIF-67 crystals, similarly to the preparation of ZnO derived from ZIF-8. The crystal structure and morphology of the prepared ZIFs are analyzed by X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD), SEM and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).As shown in Fig. 2a, the position of the diffraction peaks of the obtained ZIF-67, ZIF-8 and ZIF-8ZIF-67 crystals correspond well to the patterns simulated from the single crystal structures of ZIF-67 or ZIF-8. 32,35TEM (Fig. 2b) and SEM (Fig. 2c) images confirm that the obtained white ZIF-8 powders consist of dispersed rhombic dodecahedral crystals with a uniform size of 350 nm.After carefully dispersing ZIF-8 seeds in methanol and adding a methanolic solution of CoCl 2 and MeIm units, a crystalline shell of purple ZIF-67 is grown on the surface of the ZIF-8 seed.The core-shell structured ZIF crystals (ZIF-8ZIF-67) can also be observed on TEM elemental mapping images (Fig. 2d), revealing the layer of cobalt species homogeneously coated on the core of the zinc species.As shown in Fig. 2e andf, the size of the obtained ZIF-8ZIF-67 increases up to 450 nm, and the crystals exhibit a similar dispersity and morphology to the ZIF-8 seeds. 35cording to the XRD measurements (Fig. 3a), the calcination of ZIF-8 and ZIF-67 leads to the formation of hexagonal ZnO (JCPDS card 01-1136) and cubic Co 3 O 4 (JCPDS card 01-1152), respectively.For ZIF-8ZIF-67 crystals, the calcined product consists in a combination of a main core phase (hexagonal ZnO) and a secondary shell phase (cubic Co 3 O 4 ).X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is conducted to further ascertain the electronic configuration of the obtained compounds.Two forms of cobalt oxide, CoO and Co 3 O 4 , can be distinguished from the location of the satellite peaks from the XPS spectra. 36 shown in Fig. S3a, a low satellite peak appears at a binding energy of 789.6 eV, which is about 9.9 eV higher than the peak of Co 2p3/2 (779.7 eV) and belongs to the typical satellite peak of Co 3 O 4 . 36Because the typical satellite peak of CoO is only about 2.1 eV higher than the position of the main peak of Co 2p3/2. 37The electric states of Zn in the samples derived from ZIF-8 and ZIF-8ZIF-67 were shown in Fig. S3b, and we can see that two characteristic peaks with respect to Zn 2p 3/2 and Zn 2p 1/2 confirm the Zn 2 state of ZnO in these samples. 38From the results of XRD and XPS (Fig. 3a and Fig. S3), it demonstrates that the products derived from ZIF-67, ZIF-8 and ZIF-8ZIF-67 are Co 3 O 4 , ZnO and ZnOCo 3 O 4 , respectively. The structure and morphology of the calcined metal oxides are observed by SEM and TEM.As shown in Fig. 3b-c and Fig. S4, the obtained ZnO particles have a porous structure and retain the original rhombic dodecahedron shape from the parent ZIF-8.ZIF-8ZIF-67 crystals were thermally converted to ZnOCo 3 O 4 in the same way.Can they remain the core-shell structure (The type of A as pictured in Fig. 1)?As revealed by SEM and TEM (Fig. 3d-f and Fig. S5), the obtained ZnOCo 3 O 4 composite consists of rhombic dodecahedron-shaped porous crystals, whose surfaces are decorated with nanoparticles. According to the elemental mapping images (Fig. 3g) along with the high resolution TEM images (Fig. S5c), the rhombic dodecahedron-shaped porous crystals are composed of ZnO, while the 25 nm nanoparticles are composed of Co 3 O 4 .The results indicate that the morphology of the obtained ZnOCo 3 O 4 composite correspond to the B type pictured in Fig. 1.To assess the porosity of the as-prepared ZnOCo 3 O 4 composite, ZIF-8-derived ZnO, ZIF-67-derived Co 3 O 4 (Fig. S6), along with the commercial ZnO (Fig. S7), the N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms are acquired (Fig. S8a) and the pore size distributions (Fig. S8b) of the samples are shown.The estimated structural parameters, including the specific surface area (S BET ), total pore volume (V total ) and the average pore size, are summarized in Table S1.In general, a higher the specific surface area contains more active sites. 39,40We can clearly see from the Table S1 that the ZIFs derived metal oxides possess a higher specific surface area than that of commercial ZnO. In order to evaluate the structural advantages of the ZIFs-derived porous metal oxides for CO 2 photoreduction, the photocatalytic reaction was carried out in a gas-closed circulation system in the presence of water vapor and CO 2 .As shown in Fig. 4a andb, CO 2 is photoreduced into CH 4 and CO under UV-vis irradiation, and the amounts of CH 4 and CO generated by using ZIF-8-derived ZnO are much larger than that of the commercial ZnO and ZIF-67-derived Co 3 O 4 .After coating with Co 3 O 4 , ZnOCo 3 O 4 exhibits the highest activity among all the samples.As calculated according to how each compound evolved after 6 h (Fig. 4c), the rate of CH 4 generation using is 0.99 mol g -1 h -1 , which is about 66 times higher than the commercial ZnO (0.015 mol g -1 h -1 ) and 367 times higher than that of commercial TiO 2 (P25) (0.0027 mol g -1 h -1 ).The photocatalytic activity of ZnOCo 3 O 4 is compared with previously reported results under similar conditions (Table S2).In this study, due to the porous structural property and the effect of Co 3 O 4 as co-catalyst, a superior photocatalytic performance can be achieved.In order to explore the source of C in CH 4 and CO, contrastive experiments were performed in the dark or under light irradiation in the absence of photocatalysts, CO 2 or water, and only negligible CH 4 or CO was detected.A more exact control experiment was performed by using 13 CO 2 instead of 12 CO 2 (GC-MS are shown in Fig. S9).The main peak with a retention time from 02:50-03:45 min is confirmed to be 13 CO 2 .The two other peaks with retention times of 02:06 and 02:19 min are the main products: O 2 , CO and CH 4 .Moreover, the main organic product CO and CH 4 are verified to be 13 CO and 13 CH 4 . Therefore, the results of the above experiments demonstrate that the source of C in CH 4 and CO was generated from CO 2 through a photocatalytic process. In order to study how the calcination temperature affects the photocatalytic activity, we prepared ZnOCo 3 O 4 in different temperature (400, 500 and 600 o C).In general, the size of the ZnO grain increases with the calcination temperature.As expected, the average crystalline sizes of ZnO in ZnOCo 3 O 4 -400, ZnOCo 3 O 4 -500, and ZnOCo 3 O 4 -600 estimated from Scherrer equation (D k/cos) via XRD (Fig. S10) are 12.0, 22.1 and 40.2 nm, respectively, which is in good agreement with the results of TEM images (Fig. S5c andS11).That is to say, as the calcination temperature increases, the crystalline sizes increase and lead to the structural collapse of the porous rhombic dodecahedron.In the end, the specific surface area reduces and the pore size distribution weakens or disappears (Fig. S12).As we know, the larger the specific surface area of photocatalysts, the higher the photocatalytic activity. 12,13,41g. S13 clearly shows that CO 2 is photoreduced to CH 4 and CO under UV-vis light, and the generated rate of products decreases with the increased calcination temperature.Therefore, the sequence of photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction is ZnOCo 3 O 4 -400 ZnOCo 3 O 4 -500 ZnOCo 3 O 4 -600, in accordance with the specific surface area. Further investigating the photocatalytic stability is necessary.As shown in Fig. 4a andb, the CO evolution of the ZIF-8-derived ZnO is stable, while the CH 4 evolution slows down after 7 h.When the ZnO is coated with Co 3 O 4 nanoparticles, the stability is enhanced (Fig. 4b).One could wonder why ZnOCo 3 O 4 possesses better photocatalytic stability than the ZnO.It is well known that photocorrosion of ZnO, which reduces the photocatalytic stability of ZnO, occurs easily.The changes in the main phase composition and in the structure caused by the photocatalytic reaction are investigated by XRD, XPS and TEM.Before the photocatalytic reaction (Fig. 5a andb), the commercial ZnO and the ZIF-8-derived ZnO have a hexagonal ZnO crystal structure (JCPDS card 01-1136), while after, both of them have a rhombohedral ZnCO 3 structure (JCPDS card 03-0774).In the case of ZnOCo 3 O 4 , there is no obvious change after the photocatalytic reaction (Fig. 5c).The C 1s XPS patterns (Fig. 5d-f) of the samples also show that CO 3 2-(289 eV) is present in both the commercial ZnO and ZIF-8-derived ZnO, but cannot be detected in the ZnOCo 3 O 4 after the photocatalytic reaction. Furthermore, we observe by TEM a change in the morphology of ZnO and ZnOCo 3 O 4 following the photocatalytic reaction (Fig. 6a-d).The TEM images show that the morphology of ZnO has been destroyed, while the morphology of ZnOCo 3 O 4 is well-retained.The proposed ideal reaction equations for the photoreduction of CO 2 by ZnO under UV-vis irradiation are depicted in Fig. S14a (1, 2, 3).XRD and XPS analysis suggest, however, the appearance of ZnCO 3 (Fig. 5) and the instability of the CH 4 evolution (Fig. 4b) after the photocatalytic reaction.That is to say, the photocorrosion of ZnO occurs and the actual reaction equations are as presented in Fig. S14a (1, 4, 5), which result in the instability of the CH 4 evolution.On the other hand, there is no obvious change after the photocatalytic reaction for the ZnOCo 3 O 4 , indicating that the reaction equations for the photoreduction of CO 2 with"}, {"llm generation": "UV-vis", "source": "Fig. 4 (a) CO and (b) CH 4 evolution over various samples under UV-vis irradiation.(c) Comparison of the photocatalytic activity of the photocatalysts under UV-vis irradiation, calculated according to how each compound evolved after 6 h.", "context": "We have designed a convenient approach to prepare a novel porous ZnOCo 3 O 4 composite by using core-shell ZIF-8ZIF-67 crystals as the precursor, and by combining a seed-mediated solvothermal process with a two-step calcination.The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 shows that the advantageous porous structure of ZnOCo 3 O 4 and the co-catalytic properties of ZnO coated with Co 3 O 4 can lead to a superior photocatalytic performance.The generated rate of CH 4 over ZnOCo 3 O 4 is 0.99 mol g -1 h -1 , which is about 66 times higher than the commercial ZnO and 367 times higher than that of commercial TiO 2 (P25 The common ZIFs, such as rhombic dodecahedral ZIF-67 (Co(2-methylimidazole) 2 n , space group I-43m, a 16.9589(3)A, 90; b 16.9589(3)A, 90; c 16.9589(3)A, 90) and ZIF-8 (Zn(2-methylimidazole) 2 n , space group I-43m, a 16.9910(12)A, 90; b 16.9910(12) Published on 22 February 2016.Downloaded by Purdue University on 23/02/2016 05:11:29.
