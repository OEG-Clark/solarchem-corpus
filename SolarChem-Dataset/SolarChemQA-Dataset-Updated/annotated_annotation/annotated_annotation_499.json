Sn 2 O 7 micro/nanospheres were successfully synthesized by a facile hydrothermal method and Au nanoparticles were deposited on La 2 Sn 2 O 7 via H 2 AuCl 6 impregnation followed by NaBH 4 reduction.The prepared La 2 Sn 2 O 7 sample showed photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activities and CH 4 , CO, and H 2 were the main reduction products.Deposition of an Au cocatalyst signicantly improved photocatalytic performance.The highest evolution rates of CH 4 , CO, and H 2 were observed over 1.0 wt Au/La 2 Sn 2 O 7 samples with 0.43, 0.37, and 6.98 mmol h A1 , respectively.The apparent quantum yield (AQY) was 2.54, which was enhanced by 3 times in contrast to bare La 2 Sn 2 O 7 .An Au co-catalyst plays an excellent role as an electron transfer mediator.Our results indicate promising application of the La 2 Sn 2 O 7 photocatalyst for CO 2 reduction.Moreover, Au nanoparticles could be superior candidates for a co-catalyst to enhance CO 2 reduction activities.Notes and references 1 L.
