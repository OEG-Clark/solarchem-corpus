It can be seen that HCNS show (1 0 0) and (2 0 0) characteristic peaks around 12.9and 27.4, respectively, corresponded to the in-plane ordering of tri-s-triazine motifs and the interlayer stacking of aromatic rings (Shiravnd et al., 2017).For nanocomposite of HCNSTiO 2 , in addition to those two early peaks related to carbon nitride, the other main peaks appeared at 2 25.3,37.9, 48.1, 54.0, 55.2, and 62.8can be well-matched with anatase phase of TiO 2 (JCPDS 21-1272) formed on the surface of spherical carbon nitride.The peaks position of HCNS remained unchanged in HCNSTiO 2 , which indicated that modification of sphere C 3 N 4 with TiO 2 shell did not destroy its crystalline structure.However, with the formation TiO 2 shell, a smooth decrease was observed in the diffraction peak intensity of HCNS.That should be due to reducing amount of g-C 3 N 4 in the composite and also it could be due to the peaks intensity of TiO 2 appearance stronger than that of g-C 3 N 4 (Crake et al., 2019;Zhou et al., 2014;Jiang et al., 2018b). XPS was utilized to analyze the oxidation state, the surface chemical composition and the interaction between TiO 2 with HCNS support in the prepared photocatalyst.The XPS survey spectrum (Fig. 3a) indicates that the photocatalyst surface is primarily composed of C, N, O and Ti elements.As shown in Fig. 3b the high resolution XPS spectrum of C 1s can be divided into two peaks centered at 284.8 and 288.4 eV that the first peak is can be attributed to CeC coordination of the surface adventitious carbon or the sp 2 -bonded carbon of CeN and the second peak is attributed to sp 2 -bonded carbon in the triazine rings of g-C 3 N 4 .It can be seen that the binding energy of NeCeN in the prepared photocatalyst shifts to the higher energy region in comparison to pristine g-C 3 N 4 .Fig. 3c shows that the high-resolution N 1s spectrum of photocatalyst can be deconvoluted into the three individual peaks with the binding energies of 401.25 eV, 399.98 eV, and 398.78 eV.The mean peak at 398.78 eV is attributed to sp 2 hybridized aromatic nitrogen (CNeC) and the other two peaks centered at 399.98 and 401.25 eV can be assigned to the tertiary nitrogen groups (Ne(C) 3 ) of the triazine skeleton and the free amino group (CeNeH), respectively.However, these three peaks have a shift toward higher energy binding compared with pristine g-C 3 N 4 .The polymerization of cyanamide was confirmed by determining the presence (N-(C) 3 ) group in N 1s spectra.The two peaks of O 1s located around 530.4 and 532.5 eV (Fig. 3d) are assigned to the oxygen atoms in TieO band and hydroxyl group of adsorbed water molecules on the surface of the sample, respectively.As shown in Fig. 3e, two distinct peaks around 458.2 and 463.9 eV with a slightly shift toward lower binding energies compared with TiO 2 powder are observed in Ti 2p spectra that correspond to Ti 2p 3/2 and Ti 2p 1/2 of Ti 4 in TiO 2 , respectively.The shift of Ti 2p to lower binding energy and up-shifts observed for C 1s and N 1s can be attributed to the chemical environment change resulting from the interaction between TiO 2 nanosheets and HCNS support.These interaction may lead to the efficient separation of electrons and holes, thereby resulting in improved photoactivity (Li et al., 2017;Sheng et al., 2019). To determine the rate of separation and trapping of photogenerated electron-hole pairs and studying the lifetime of charge carriers, photoluminescence (PL) emission of samples were recorded in the range 350-800 nm with excitation wavelength at 325 nm.For monitoring the fluorescence property, 3 mL of the dispersed of the prepared materials (0.03 g/L in distilled water) was poured into a quartz cuvette and the PL spectra were recorded at room temperature.As shown in Fig. 4, pristine g-C 3 N 4 and HCNS showed an emission peak with the same intensity at about 460 nm.On the other hand, it is clear that after the composite formation of HCNS and TiO 2 , the emission intensity for HCNSTiO 2 composite is decreased at the same emission position, due to the appropriate separation of electron-hole pairs in HCNSTiO 2 composite.These results suggest that hierarchical nanostructure of HCNSTiO 2 can be operated as an improved photocatalyst. Absorption light ability is another effective property of the photocatalytic efficiency.In this regard, the light absorption properties of pristine g-C 3 N 4 , HCNS and HCNSTiO 2 were carried out by diffuse reflectance spectrometry (DRS) in the UV-Vis region of the electromagnetic radiation.As shown in Fig. 5a, no significant difference is detected for pristine g-C 3 N 4 and HCNS within the visible light range, and for HCNSTiO 2 sample, the absorption capability in the visible region of the spectrum is suitable after coupling between g-C 3 N 4 and TiO 2 semiconductors.The optical band gaps of pristine g-C 3 N 4 , HCNS and HCNSTiO 2 were calculated as 2.69, 2.73 and 2.87, respectively, by a plot of (h) 2 versus energy (Fig. 5b).These results revealed that HCNSTiO 2 composite has a good band gap which leads to its enhanced visible light response and more effective photocatalytic activity toward CO 2 reduction. To determine the TiO 2 content in the engineered photocatalyst, thermogravimetric analysis was performed from room temperature to 900 C under air atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 C min -1 .As can be seen in Fig. 6, for the HCNS rapid weight loss is observed from about 680 C and complete weight loss due to decomposition of g-C 3 N 4 is occurred in the temperature region around 700-720 C.The HCNSTiO 2 nanostructure has a significant weight loss at about 650 C, which can be attributed to decomposition of g-C 3 N 4 in the heterojunction structure.The complete decomposition of HCNS indicates that the silica template was completely removed in the procedure of synthesis.The TiO 2 amount in the composite is estimated to be 20 by remaining weight of composite after heating the photocatalyst over 700 C. The photocatalytic activity depends greatly on adsorption properties of semiconductor including specific surface area and porosity.The N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of HCNS, HCNSTiO 2 and pristine C 3 N 4 are shown in Fig. 7a.Unlike pristine g-C 3 N 4 , the typical type IV isotherm with an H 1 hysteresis loop for HCNS and HCNSTiO 2 , illustrates that these compounds have uniform mesoporous structures with slit pore geometry.The textural properties of the compounds consist of specific surface area (S BET ), total pore volumes (V t ) and average pore sizes (D BJH ) are shown in the inset of Fig. 7a.The calculated specific surface area for HCNS is significantly higher than pristine C 3 N 4 .Besides, by forming a TiO 2 layer around the HCNS and wrapping the pores with TiO 2 particles, the surface areas and pore sizes of HCNSTiO 2 in comparison to pure HCNS were partly decreased.Due to the high specific surface area and mesoporous textural of HCNSTiO 2 , the photocatalytic potential of the nanocomposite can be remarkably extended.Because CO 2 adsorption is the first step for its subsequent photocatalytic reduction, the CO 2 adsorption isotherms of HCNS, HCNSTiO 2 and pristine C 3 N 4 carried out at ambient temperature (Fig. 7b).The CO 2 adsorption capacity for HCNS and HCNSTiO 2 is significantly higher than pristine g-C 3 N 4 according to N 2 adsorptiondesorption analysis.Nevertheless, for HCNS and HCNSTiO 2 samples, the results are different and HCNSTiO 2 shows the slightly higher adsorption capacity of CO 2 than HCNS.These results can be attributed to interaction between CO 2 molecules and TiO 2 particles and the production of further adsorption sites on catalyst (Jiang et al., 2018a). Hierarchical HCNSTiO 2 photocatalyst with rational properties such as hollow structure and increased active surface area is favorable in order to superior photocatalytic performance.The obtained photocatalyst was used to investigate CO 2 photoreduction under visible light illumination.As a comparison, we also studied the photocatalytic activity of commercial TiO 2 (P-25), g-C 3 N 4 and p-25/g-C 3 N 4 as a benchmark.The CO 2 photoreduction of as-prepared samples was carried out by CO 2 bubbling in aqueous solution under visible-light irradiation and atmospheric pressure.Control experiments showed that in the absence of either light irradiation or photocatalysts no hydrocarbon products were detected under same conditions, thus confirming that both are necessary for CO 2 reduction reactions. The rates of photocatalytic CH 3 OH production after 1 h, over the P-25, g-C 3 N 4 , p-25/g-C 3 N 4 and HCNSTiO 2 were shown in Fig. 8.As can be seen from this figure, P-25 and pristine g-C 3 N 4 show the lowest yield of CH 3 OH production because of the high rate of recombination of photogenerated charge carriers and poor visible light activity.Photocatalytic efficiency of p-25/g-C 3 N 4 is better than both individual semiconductors, which evidences a synergy between the g-C 3 N 4 and p-25 semiconductor components.However, the heterojunction photocatalyst of HCNSTiO 2 with nanoengineered structure greatly enhanced the CH 3 OH production rate (11.3 mol/gcat.h).This amount is over 10 and 5 times higher than the photocatalytic activity observed for P-25 and pristine g-C 3 N 4 , respectively.Key factor responsible for the enhancement in the photocatalytic efficiency of HCNSTiO 2 composite is the synergistic heterojunction formation between hollow carbon nitride sphere with TiO 2 which facilitates a fast electron transfer at the interface between HCNS and TiO 2 and enhances e --h pairs separation (Sridharan et al., 2013).The presence of synergy formed between HCNS and TiO 2 , is confirmed with the increase in its PL emission intensity.Furthermore, this increased efficiency is returned to the hollow structure of HCNS, which improves the light-harvesting in the visible range This apparent extension in visible light photocatalytic activity of HCNSTiO 2 composite toward CO 2 photoreduction can be assigned to the smart design of nanostructured photocatalyst.The shape-engineered HCNSTiO 2 with high specific surface area and shorter charge diffusion pathway, lead to the excellent photocatalytic performance owing to enhanced light-harvesting and appropriate charge transfer with long lifetime (Sun et al., 2012;Bhunia et al., 2015;Khan et al., 2019).Besides, well-developed heterostructure formed between HCNS and TiO 2 enhances the photocatalytic activity by improving the separation efficiency of charge carriers in CO 2 photoreduction process (Wei et al., 2017;Li et al., 2017).In order to further analysis on the photocatalytic process of hierarchical HCNSTiO 2 composite, the hydrocarbons production was studied under the same experimental conditions described above by HCNSTiO 2 photocatalyst.As can be seen in Fig. 9, after the light irradiation for 1 h, methanol and methane are the main products while the other byproducts of CO 2 photoreduction, including of HCHO and HCOOH were negligible as they were measured by the GC-FID analysis. Because of the much higher production rate of CH 3 OH and CH 4 , we analyze the photocatalytic evolution of CH 3 OH and CH 4 with different reaction times, as shown in Fig. 10.Initially, methanol is the main product of the photocatalytic reaction, but the amount of methane continuously increases over time and its yield after 3 h arrives as high as 12.7 mol/g cat., which is comparable to that of methanol amount in the first hour of reaction.However, the production of CH 3 OH and CH 4 gradually start and continuously increase over time so that after 6 h amounts of CH 3 OH and CH 4 reached 52.1 mol/g cat .and 21.3 mol/ g cat., respectively.These results further demonstrate that the synergistic effect between HCNS and TiO 2 plays a major role for the generation of electron-hole pairs and therefore the improved photoconversion activity that introduces the shape-engineered HCNSTiO 2 composite as a powerful photocatalyst for CH 3 OH or solar fuel (CH 3 OH/CH 4 ) production (Sridharan et al., 2013;Lu et al., 2017a). To have a better understanding of the above results, a Scheme of photocatalytic mechanism for enhanced efficiency of the reduction of CO 2 under visible light irradiation is proposed in Scheme 1.The high specific surface area and hollow structure of photocatalyst can develop the active sites for CO 2 molecules adsorption and increased the light absorption to enhance the visible-response photocatalytic activity.Furthermore, the lifetime of electron-hole pairs and light absorption in the visible region increased when HCNS coupled with TiO 2 in designing an II-type heterojunction.Photogenerated charges can migrate easily between the interface of HCNS and TiO 2 as shown in Scheme 1.As the conduction band position of g-C 3 N 4 is more negative than TiO 2 , -1.3 eV and -0.5 eV, respectively, the electrons on HCNS can migrate to the conduction band of TiO 2 .Therefore, the accumulation of holes in HCNS and the accumulation of electrons in TiO 2 can lead to oxidation and reduction reactions in CO 2 conversion process, respectively.The excited electrons could reduce CO 2 molecule to CH 3 OH and CH 4 and photogenerated holes could oxidize H 2 O molecules to generate H and O 2 .DRS and PL analysis as mentioned above confirmed these findings The photocatalytic stability of HCNSTiO 2 as an important property of photocatalytic behavior was checked by 5-time recycle experimentally (Fig. S3).For each new run, the photocatalyst was separated, washed with distilled water and dried in the nitrogen atmosphere.As represented in Fig. S3, no significant deactivation was detected throughout the five runs and catalyst can be used for many cycles after reused with fresh reductant (CO 2 and H 2 O).The results indicated that only 5 of the methanol production efficiency was decreased after five cycles.Furthermore, the structural properties and chemical stability of engineered photocatalyst were evaluated by XRD and FE-SEM analysis, after recovery from the reaction solution.As shown in Fig. S4.no distinguished variation in structure and morphology of catalyst was observed in compared with freshly prepared one.In order to ensure the efficient performance of current hierarchical photocatalyst, its efficiency was compared with various g-C 3 N 4 based photocatalyst systems for photoreduction of CO 2 to CH 3 OH and CH 4 (Table S1).The comparison indicated that this photocatalyst with unique characteristics has considerable potential for converting CO 2 to solar fuel than most of mentioned photocatalysts.Furthermore, the synergistic effect between g-C 3 N 4 and TiO 2 , high stability and non-use of noble metal, convert this nanostructure to a prominent, stable and inexpensive photocatalyst for"}], "reactor type": [], "operation mode": []}}
