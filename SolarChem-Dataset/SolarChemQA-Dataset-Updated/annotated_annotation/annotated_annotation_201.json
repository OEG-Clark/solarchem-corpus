The photocatalytic runs were carried out in a Pyrex batch gassolid reactor (V 100 mL) irradiated from the top by a 400 W medium pressure Hg lamp.A water filter was positioned between the lamp and the photoreactor in order to cut the infrared radiation.0.5 g of catalyst powder were placed inside the photoreactor, and be-fore beginning any run, N 2 was flushed for some hours inside the system under UV irradiation in order to photodesorb possible impurities or carbon residues from the catalyst surface.Afterwards, the photoreactor was saturated with CO 2 and then a certain amount of water was injected in the reactor with a microsyringe.0.5 ml of the gaseous mixture were withdrawn at fixed irradiation times by using a gas-tight microsyringe.The evolution of the formed products was followed by a GC-2010 Shimadzu gas chromatograph equipped with a Phenomenex Zebron Wax-plus (30 m 0.32 m 0.53 m) column and a flame ionization detector, using He as the carrier gas."}, {"llm generation": "supported TiO2/SiO2 sample", "source": "A supported TiO 2 /SiO 2 sample was prepared following the same procedure of the sample HP2 by adding Santa Barbara amorphous silica-15 (SBA) 32 to the solution containing Ti(OC 4 H 9 ) 4 , n-butanol, acetic acid and CuCl 2 2H 2 O.", "context": "Four commercial TiO 2 powders were used: Merck, Evonik P25, Mirkat M211 and Hombikat PC500.Home prepared (HP) TiO 2 samples were obtained by using titanium(IV) chloride (TiCl 4 , Fluka 98) and titanium(IV) butoxide (Ti(OC 4 H 9 ) 4 , Sigma Aldrich 97) as the starting materials. TiCl 4 was slowly added to distilled water (molar ratio Ti/H 2 O 1:60; volume ratio 1:10) at room temperature.After ca. 12 h of continuous stirring, a clear solution was obtained.The solution was boiled for 2 h under agitation.This treatment produced a milky white TiO 2 dispersion that was dried under vacuum at 323 K.This sample was labeled as HP1. A composite TiO 2 /SiO 2 material was prepared in order to study the role of SiO 2 as support.10 g of commercial SiO 2 (Cabot) were added to 110 mL of the solution obtained by adding 10 ml of TiCl 4 to 100 ml of H 2 O.The stirred suspension was boiled for 2 h, cooled to room temperature and dried in a rotary evaporator.The sample was labeled as HP1/SiO 2 . Copper-loaded samples were prepared by adding the desired amount of CuCl 2 2H 2 O (Sigma Aldrich 99) to the aqueous TiCl 4 solution.Two samples were prepared with Cu percentage amounts of 1 and 2 wt with respect to TiO 2 .The codices used for these samples were 1Cu-HP1 and 2Cu-HP1, respectively.Copperloaded samples supported on SiO 2 by a procedure analogous to that described for the bare TiO 2 /SiO 2 were labeled as 1 and 2Cu-HP1/SiO 2 . 10 mL of TiCl 4 were slowly added to 50 ml of distilled water at room temperature.After ca. 15 min of continuous stirring, the clear obtained solution was sealed in a bottle and kept in an oven at 373 K for 48 h.The bottle was allowed to cool to room temperature and the resultant solid was recovered using a vacuum pump at 323 K.The sample was labeled HP-rutile. 15 mL of TiCl 4 were added dropwise to a solution containing 630 mL of demineralized water and 240 mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid.The solution obtained after continuous stirring was heated in a tightly closed glass bottle and aged at 373 K in an oven for 48 h.The resultant precipitate contained a mixture of brookite and rutile.Pure brookite nanoparticles were separated by peptization by removing many times the surnatant and adding water to restore the initial solution volume.After a few washings, a dispersion of brookite particles was obtained whilst the rutile phase remained as a precipitate.The dispersions containing the brookite particles were collected and dried under vacuum at 673 K.The sample was identified as HP-brookite. 6.8 mL of Ti(OC 4 H 9 ) 4 were added to a solution of 7.3 mL of anhydrous n-butanol (Sigma Aldrich 99.8) and 4.6 mL of acetic acid.The mixture was vigorously stirred for 1 h and the resultant solution was dried in an oven at 423 K.The recovered solid was calcined at 773 K for 0.5 h.The sample was labeled as HP2. A Cu-loaded sample, identified as 2Cu-HP2, was prepared by adding the desired amount of CuCl 2 2H 2 O to the solution containing anhydrous n-butanol, acetic acid and Ti(OC 4 H 9 ) 4 .

( 1):", "context": "(Fig. 1) shows the diffraction patters of the home prepared samples.(Fig. 1A) reports the diffractograms of the samples prepared from TiCl 4 , (Fig. 1B) those prepared from Ti(OC 4 H 9 ) 4 . All the HP1 samples presented peaks of anatase and rutile.The peaks were very broad, characteristic of partially crystalline powders.Single sharp peaks of rutile or brookite were instead obtained for the HP-rutile and HP-brookite samples, respectively. The X-ray diffraction peaks of the HP2 samples (Fig. 1B) were consistent with those of anatase.HP2 samples were more crystalline that the HP1 ones due to the high temperature reached during their preparation.In any case, no peaks related to Cu were observed in the Cu-loaded samples, probably due to the low amount and/or to the high degree of dispersion of the metal species on the support. As reported in (Table 1), the specific surface areas of the various home-prepared samples ranged between 31 and 87 m 2 g -1 .A noticeable increase of SSA ranging between 114 and 217 m 2 g -1 was obtained when TiO 2 was supported on silica. (Fig. 2) shows SEM images of some home-prepared samples.The morphology of the powders synthesized from TiCl 4 in mild conditions was very different from that of the catalysts obtained from Ti(OC 4 H 9 ) 4 and calcined at 773 K. HP-rutile (Fig. 2a) consisted of particles of spheroidal shapes with average sizes of 1-2 m which were aggregates of smaller particles with diameters ranging between 40 and 70 nm.The micrographs of HP1 (Fig. 2b) revealed more regular aggregates of small particles with diameters ranging between 60 and 70 nm.As shown in (Fig. 2c), the samples supported on SiO 2 exhibited similar morphology by indicating that the silica particles worked as nucleation centres for the precipitation of TiO 2 .Differently, HP2 samples (Fig. 2d) consisted of very fine close-packed particles with diameters of 10-20 nm.No significant differences could be seen from the micrographs of the Cu loaded samples compared to those of bare HP1 or HP2 samples. EDX mapping analysis of Cu on the catalysts indicated that Cu was uniformly dispersed on the TiO 2 surface.(Table 1) reports the atomic percentages of Cu with respect to the (Cu Ti) atomic content. (Fig. 3) shows diffuse reflectance spectra of various samples.The spectra of the powders supported on SiO 2 were similar to those of the unsupported samples.All the spectra of the copper-loaded samples showed a maximum value of reflectance at about 500 nm.The presence of copper caused the shift of the absorption edge toward higher wavelengths with respect to the bare TiO 2 powders.The band gap energy, E g , of each sample was estimated from the tangent line in the plots of the modified Kubelka-Munk function F(R' )h 1/2 versus the energy of the exciting light 33.As shown in (Table 1), the E g values of the Cu-loaded HP1 samples were lower than those of the bare HP1 powders and decreased with increasing the copper content. Blank tests carried out in the same experimental conditions ensured that no organic compounds were produced in the absence of catalyst as well as in the dark.4) shows a comparison among the peak amounts of the main conversion products obtained with commercial and home-prepared samples.TiO 2 Evonik P25 and TiO 2 Hombikat PC500 were inactive whereas some reactivity was observed in the presence of TiO 2 Merck or TiO 2 Mirkat M211.By using TiO 2 Merck, mainly acetaldehyde was obtained with a maximum amount of 0.27 mol/g-cat after 4 h of UV irradiation, that decreased until 0.08 mol/g-cat after 8 h.Very low amounts of methane, methanol and propanone (0.04, 0.02 and 0.02 mol/g-cat, respectively) that remained almost constant during the run were also detected.Differently, TiO 2 Mirkat M211 yielded formaldehyde (0.17 mol/g-cat) and methane (0.1 mol/g-cat) as the primary reduction products after 5 h of irradiation. The home-prepared HP1 and HP-rutile samples were more efficient than the commercial TiO 2 powders.HP1 produced a maximum amount of 0.37 mol/g-cat of formaldehyde in 1 h whereas ca.0.83 mol/g-cat of methane and 0.09 mol/g-cat of acetaldehyde were obtained after 6 hours of irradiation in the presence of HP-rutile.It is worth noting that HP1-brookite was practically inactive. The formation of hydrogenated compounds without any apparent proton source is justified by the presence of surface physically adsorbed water, already previously determined by thermogravimetric analysis 34, which is activated upon illumination 31.When the photocatalytic runs were carried out in the presence of water vapour, CH 4 yield generally decreased and, in the case of HP-rutile, a six fold diminution was observed.This result can be explained by considering the competition of water molecules with CO 2 for the adsorption on the catalyst surface. Formaldehyde was the major product detected when the photocatalytic runs were carried out in the presence of CO 2 and water vapour using bare and copper-loaded HP1 catalysts.(Fig. 5) shows the time dependence of the formaldehyde yields obtained with the three catalysts.Formaldehyde continuously increased and reached the amount of 0.11 mol/g-cat after 6 hours of irradiation of HP1.When the samples were loaded with 1 or 2 of Cu, the amount of formaldehyde increased to ca. 1.14 or 0.8 mol/g-cat, respectively.The production of formaldehyde stopped when the light was turned off confirming that HCHO was photocatalytically formed.As shown in (Fig. 5), a volcano dependence of the formaldehyde yield with the copper loading was observed.1Cu-HP1 was more active than 2Cu-HP1 and exhibited a ca.10-fold enhancement of formaldehyde production with respect to that of bare HP1.These results are in agreement with literature works reporting an optimum copper loading of various TiO 2 photocatalysts active for the photoreduction of CO 2 to methanol 9,12,22,35,36 or methane 37. Copper probably serves as an electron trapper that inhibits the recombination of holes and electrons but excess Cu loading can mask the TiO 2 surface, reducing the light exposure of the catalyst.Moreover, the incorporation of copper generates basic sites relatively stronger than those of TiO 2 38 so that a larger amount of CO 2 can be adsorbed by the catalyst. (Fig. 6) shows a comparison among the peak amounts of the main conversion products obtained with various catalysts.Differently from the results obtained with the unsupported samples, acetaldehyde and not formaldehyde was the main compound produced in the presence of HP1/SiO 2 and 1Cu-HP1/SiO 2 .The amount of acetaldehyde increased with the irradiation time and reached 0.35 and 0.5 mol/g-cat, respectively, after 6 hours of irradiation.Methane (ca.0.04 mol/g-cat), methanol and propanone (0.02 mol/gcat) were also obtained, but their amounts remained almost constant throughout the runs.The presence of 1 wt of copper enhanced the yield of acetaldehyde but 2Cu-HP1/SiO 2 was much less active, producing only a small amount of methane. The formation of acetaldehyde is probably favoured by the high dispersion state of TiO 2 and the largest specific surface area of the Acetaldehyde was also obtained in the presence of HP-rutile along with methane as main products of the reaction.Anyway, the maximum amount of acetaldehyde obtained with HP1/SiO 2 was about 3.3 times higher than that detected with HP-rutile whereas the methane yield was practically the same. Thermodynamically, the reduction of CO 2 requires that the bottom energy level of the conduction band of the semiconductor is more negative than the reduction potential of the various processes that lead to the reduced products.(Fig. 7) shows the alignment of the conduction bands of anatase 39 and rutile 40 with the reduction potentials of the possible reactions that can occur in the reduction of CO 2 41.All potentials are referred to the normal hydrogen electrode at pH 7.Only the formation of methane is energetically possible in the presence of rutile and this justifies the absence of formaldehyde that is instead the main compound obtained with the HP1 samples that prevalently consist of anatase. The photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 to organic compounds is quite complex and most of the researchers have hypothesized multielectron transfer processes to obtain the final hydrogenated products 4,8,17,424344. The formation of formaldehyde and/or methane can be justified by a mechanism proposed by Subrahmanyam et al. 42.UV irradiation of TiO 2 generates electron-hole pairs according to Eq. ( 1): In the absence of molecular oxygen, H can be reduced to H: Hydrogen atoms can combine to give hydrogen molecules or react with CO 2 to give formic acid: Formic acid can react with H giving formaldehyde that can be reduced to methanol: Finally, methanol can be reduced to methane: Acetaldehyde could be formed by reaction between CH 3 and formaldehyde: The kind of obtained products depends on the nature of the catalyst and on the experimental conditions such as H 2 O/CO 2 ratio, UV wavelength, light intensity, reaction medium and reactor configuration. The experimental results seem to suggest that the reaction (10), involving the formation of a C-C bond and leading to acetaldehyde through the reaction (11), occurs preferentially on photocatalysts with relatively high specific surface areas (HP-rutile, HP1/SiO 2 samples) since the interactions among the adsorbed precursor species should be statistically favoured on a larger surface. (Fig. 8) shows the peak amounts of the main conversion products obtained in the presence of the HP2 samples and water vapour.Methane was the main compound detected by using bare HP2.Its concentration increased during the run reaching ca.3.1 mol/g-cat after 6 h of irradiation.Also formaldehyde and acetaldehyde were formed, albeit their concentration increased to ca. 0.85 and 0.3 mol/g-cat respectively after 1.5 hours and then decreased to ca. 0.2 mol/g-cat after 6 hours of irradiation.The yields of formaldehyde and methane dramatically decreased if HP2 was loaded with 2 of copper or supported on mesoporous SBA silica.These results apparently disagree with those reported by Wu and coworkers who prevalently obtained methanol with samples prepared in a similar way.Anyway, it is worth noting that the reaction system was often completely different (photoreactor with TiO 2 coated optical fibers 35,36, UVC light as irradiation source 10,22) or CO 2 photoreduction occurred in an aqueous solution 9 rather than in vapour phase."}, {"llm generation": "TiO2 Merck", "source": "By using TiO 2 Merck, mainly acetaldehyde was obtained with a maximum amount of 0.27 mol/g-cat after 4 h of UV irradiation, that decreased until 0.08 mol/g-cat after 8 h.", "context": "(Fig. 1) shows the diffraction patters of the home prepared samples.(Fig. 1A) reports the diffractograms of the samples prepared from TiCl 4 , (Fig. 1B) those prepared from Ti(OC 4 H 9 ) 4 .

All the HP1 samples presented peaks of anatase and rutile.The peaks were very broad, characteristic of partially crystalline powders.Single sharp peaks of rutile or brookite were instead obtained for the HP-rutile and HP-brookite samples, respectively. The X-ray diffraction peaks of the HP2 samples (Fig. 1B) were consistent with those of anatase.HP2 samples were more crystalline that the HP1 ones due to the high temperature reached during their preparation.In any case, no peaks related to Cu were observed in the Cu-loaded samples, probably due to the low amount and/or to the high degree of dispersion of the metal species on the support. As reported in (Table 1), the specific surface areas of the various home-prepared samples ranged between 31 and 87 m 2 g -1 .A noticeable increase of SSA ranging between 114 and 217 m 2 g -1 was obtained when TiO 2 was supported on silica. (Fig. 2) shows SEM images of some home-prepared samples.The morphology of the powders synthesized from TiCl 4 in mild conditions was very different from that of the catalysts obtained from Ti(OC 4 H 9 ) 4 and calcined at 773 K. HP-rutile (Fig. 2a) consisted of particles of spheroidal shapes with average sizes of 1-2 m which were aggregates of smaller particles with diameters ranging between 40 and 70 nm.The micrographs of HP1 (Fig. 2b) revealed more regular aggregates of small particles with diameters ranging between 60 and 70 nm.As shown in (Fig. 2c), the samples supported on SiO 2 exhibited similar morphology by indicating that the silica particles worked as nucleation centres for the precipitation of TiO 2 .Differently, HP2 samples (Fig. 2d) consisted of very fine close-packed particles with diameters of 10-20 nm.No significant differences could be seen from the micrographs of the Cu loaded samples compared to those of bare HP1 or HP2 samples. EDX mapping analysis of Cu on the catalysts indicated that Cu was uniformly dispersed on the TiO 2 surface.(Table 1) reports the atomic percentages of Cu with respect to the (Cu Ti) atomic content. (Fig. 3) shows diffuse reflectance spectra of various samples.The spectra of the powders supported on SiO 2 were similar to those of the unsupported samples.All the spectra of the copper-loaded samples showed a maximum value of reflectance at about 500 nm.The presence of copper caused the shift of the absorption edge toward higher wavelengths with respect to the bare TiO 2 powders.The band gap energy, E g , of each sample was estimated from the tangent line in the plots of the modified Kubelka-Munk function F(R' )h 1/2 versus the energy of the exciting light 33.As shown in (Table 1), the E g values of the Cu-loaded HP1 samples were lower than those of the bare HP1 powders and decreased with increasing the copper content. Blank tests carried out in the same experimental conditions ensured that no organic compounds were produced in the absence of catalyst as well as in the dark.4) shows a comparison among the peak amounts of the main conversion products obtained with commercial and home-prepared samples.TiO 2 Evonik P25 and TiO 2 Hombikat PC500 were inactive whereas some reactivity was observed in the presence of TiO 2 Merck or TiO 2 Mirkat M211.By using TiO 2 Merck, mainly acetaldehyde was obtained with a maximum amount of 0.27 mol/g-cat after 4 h of UV irradiation, that decreased until 0.08 mol/g-cat after 8 h.Very low amounts of methane, methanol and propanone (0.04, 0.02 and 0.02 mol/g-cat, respectively) that remained almost constant during the run were also detected.Differently, TiO 2 Mirkat M211 yielded formaldehyde (0.17 mol/g-cat) and methane (0.1 mol/g-cat) as the primary reduction products after 5 h of irradiation. The home-prepared HP1 and HP-rutile samples were more efficient than the commercial TiO 2 powders.HP1 produced a maximum amount of 0.37 mol/g-cat of formaldehyde in 1 h whereas ca.0.83 mol/g-cat of methane and 0.09 mol/g-cat of acetaldehyde were obtained after 6 hours of irradiation in the presence of HP-rutile.It is worth noting that HP1-brookite was practically inactive. The formation of hydrogenated compounds without any apparent proton source is justified by the presence of surface physically adsorbed water, already previously determined by thermogravimetric analysis 34, which is activated upon illumination 31.When the photocatalytic runs were carried out in the presence of water vapour, CH 4 yield generally decreased and, in the case of HP-rutile, a six fold diminution was observed.This result can be explained by considering the competition of water molecules with CO 2 for the adsorption on the catalyst surface. Formaldehyde was the major product detected when the photocatalytic runs were carried out in the presence of CO 2 and water vapour using bare and copper-loaded HP1 catalysts.(Fig. 5) shows the time dependence of the formaldehyde yields obtained with the three catalysts.Formaldehyde continuously increased and reached the amount of 0.11 mol/g-cat after 6 hours of irradiation of HP1.When the samples were loaded with 1 or 2 of Cu, the amount of formaldehyde increased to ca. 1.14 or 0.8 mol/g-cat, respectively.The production of formaldehyde stopped when the light was turned off confirming that HCHO was photocatalytically formed.As shown in (Fig. 5), a volcano dependence of the formaldehyde yield with the copper loading was observed.1Cu-HP1 was more active than 2Cu-HP1 and exhibited a ca.10-fold enhancement of formaldehyde production with respect to that of bare HP1.These results are in agreement with literature works reporting an optimum copper loading of various TiO 2 photocatalysts active for the photoreduction of CO 2 to methanol 9,12,22,35,36 or methane 37. Copper probably serves as an electron trapper that inhibits the recombination of holes and electrons but excess Cu loading can mask the TiO 2 surface, reducing the light exposure of the catalyst.Moreover, the incorporation of copper generates basic sites relatively stronger than those of TiO 2 38 so that a larger amount of CO 2 can be adsorbed by the catalyst. (Fig. 6) shows a comparison among the peak amounts of the main conversion products obtained with various catalysts.Differently from the results obtained with the unsupported samples, acetaldehyde and not formaldehyde was the main compound produced in the presence of HP1/SiO 2 and 1Cu-HP1/SiO 2 .The amount of acetaldehyde increased with the irradiation time and reached 0.35 and 0.5 mol/g-cat, respectively, after 6 hours of irradiation.Methane (ca.0.04 mol/g-cat), methanol and propanone (0.02 mol/gcat) were also obtained, but their amounts remained almost constant throughout the runs.The presence of 1 wt of copper enhanced the yield of acetaldehyde but 2Cu-HP1/SiO 2 was much less active, producing only a small amount of methane. The formation of acetaldehyde is probably favoured by the high dispersion state of TiO 2 and the largest specific surface area of the Acetaldehyde was also obtained in the presence of HP-rutile along with methane as main products of the reaction.Anyway, the maximum amount of acetaldehyde obtained with HP1/SiO 2 was about 3.3 times higher than that detected with HP-rutile whereas the methane yield was practically the same. Thermodynamically, the reduction of CO 2 requires that the bottom energy level of the conduction band of the semiconductor is more negative than the reduction potential of the various processes that lead to the reduced products.(Fig. 7) shows the alignment of the conduction bands of anatase 39 and rutile 40 with the reduction potentials of the possible reactions that can occur in the reduction of CO 2 41.All potentials are referred to the normal hydrogen electrode at pH 7.Only the formation of methane is energetically possible in the presence of rutile and this justifies the absence of formaldehyde that is instead the main compound obtained with the HP1 samples that prevalently consist of anatase. The photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 to organic compounds is quite complex and most of the researchers have hypothesized multielectron transfer processes to obtain the final hydrogenated products 4,8,17,424344. The formation of formaldehyde and/or methane can be justified by a mechanism proposed by Subrahmanyam et al. 42.UV irradiation of TiO 2 generates electron-hole pairs according to Eq. ( 1): In the absence of molecular oxygen, H can be reduced to H: Hydrogen atoms can combine to give hydrogen molecules or react with CO 2 to give formic acid: Formic acid can react with H giving formaldehyde that can be reduced to methanol: Finally, methanol can be reduced to methane: Acetaldehyde could be formed by reaction between CH 3 and formaldehyde: The kind of obtained products depends on the nature of the catalyst and on the experimental conditions such as H 2 O/CO 2 ratio, UV wavelength, light intensity, reaction medium and reactor configuration. The experimental results seem to suggest that the reaction (10), involving the formation of a C-C bond and leading to acetaldehyde through the reaction (11), occurs preferentially on photocatalysts with relatively high specific surface areas (HP-rutile, HP1/SiO 2 samples) since the interactions among the adsorbed precursor species should be statistically favoured on a larger surface. (Fig. 8) shows the peak amounts of the main conversion products obtained in the presence of the HP2 samples and water vapour.Methane was the main compound detected by using bare HP2.Its concentration increased during the run reaching ca.3.1 mol/g-cat after 6 h of irradiation.Also formaldehyde and acetaldehyde were formed, albeit their concentration increased to ca. 0.85 and 0.3 mol/g-cat respectively after 1.5 hours and then decreased to ca. 0.2 mol/g-cat after 6 hours of irradiation.The yields of formaldehyde and methane dramatically decreased if HP2 was loaded with 2 of copper or supported on mesoporous SBA silica.These results apparently disagree with those reported by Wu and coworkers who prevalently obtained methanol with samples prepared in a similar way.Anyway, it is worth noting that the reaction system was often completely different (photoreactor with TiO 2 coated optical fibers 35,36, UVC light as irradiation source 10,22) or CO 2 photoreduction occurred in an aqueous solution 9 rather than in vapour phase."}, {"llm generation": "UVC", "source": "Anyway, it is worth noting that the reaction system was often completely different (photoreactor with TiO 2 coated optical fibers 35,36, UVC light as irradiation source 10,22) or CO 2 photoreduction occurred in an aqueous solution 9 rather than in vapour phase.", "context": "(Fig. 1) shows the diffraction patters of the home prepared samples.(Fig. 1A) reports the diffractograms of the samples prepared from TiCl 4 , (Fig. 1B) those prepared from Ti(OC 4 H 9 ) 4 .

The X-ray diffraction peaks of the HP2 samples (Fig. 1B) were consistent with those of anatase.HP2 samples were more crystalline that the HP1 ones due to the high temperature reached during their preparation.In any case, no peaks related to Cu were observed in the Cu-loaded samples, probably due to the low amount and/or to the high degree of dispersion of the metal species on the support. As reported in (Table 1), the specific surface areas of the various home-prepared samples ranged between 31 and 87 m 2 g -1 .A noticeable increase of SSA ranging between 114 and 217 m 2 g -1 was obtained when TiO 2 was supported on silica.

(Fig. 3) shows diffuse reflectance spectra of various samples.The spectra of the powders supported on SiO 2 were similar to those of the unsupported samples.All the spectra of the copper-loaded samples showed a maximum value of reflectance at about 500 nm.The presence of copper caused the shift of the absorption edge toward higher wavelengths with respect to the bare TiO 2 powders.The band gap energy, E g , of each sample was estimated from the tangent line in the plots of the modified Kubelka-Munk function F(R' )h 1/2 versus the energy of the exciting light 33.As shown in (Table 1), the E g values of the Cu-loaded HP1 samples were lower than those of the bare HP1 powders and decreased with increasing the copper content.

The home-prepared HP1 and HP-rutile samples were more efficient than the commercial TiO 2 powders.HP1 produced a maximum amount of 0.37 mol/g-cat of formaldehyde in 1 h whereas ca.0.83 mol/g-cat of methane and 0.09 mol/g-cat of acetaldehyde were obtained after 6 hours of irradiation in the presence of HP-rutile.It is worth noting that HP1-brookite was practically inactive. The formation of hydrogenated compounds without any apparent proton source is justified by the presence of surface physically adsorbed water, already previously determined by thermogravimetric analysis 34, which is activated upon illumination 31.When the photocatalytic runs were carried out in the presence of water vapour, CH 4 yield generally decreased and, in the case of HP-rutile, a six fold diminution was observed.This result can be explained by considering the competition of water molecules with CO 2 for the adsorption on the catalyst surface. Formaldehyde was the major product detected when the photocatalytic runs were carried out in the presence of CO 2 and water vapour using bare and copper-loaded HP1 catalysts.(Fig. 5) shows the time dependence of the formaldehyde yields obtained with the three catalysts.Formaldehyde continuously increased and reached the amount of 0.11 mol/g-cat after 6 hours of irradiation of HP1.When the samples were loaded with 1 or 2 of Cu, the amount of formaldehyde increased to ca. 1.14 or 0.8 mol/g-cat, respectively.The production of formaldehyde stopped when the light was turned off confirming that HCHO was photocatalytically formed.As shown in (Fig. 5), a volcano dependence of the formaldehyde yield with the copper loading was observed.1Cu-HP1 was more active than 2Cu-HP1 and exhibited a ca.10-fold enhancement of formaldehyde production with respect to that of bare HP1.These results are in agreement with literature works reporting an optimum copper loading of various TiO 2 photocatalysts active for the photoreduction of CO 2 to methanol 9,12,22,35,36 or methane 37. Copper probably serves as an electron trapper that inhibits the recombination of holes and electrons but excess Cu loading can mask the TiO 2 surface, reducing the light exposure of the catalyst.Moreover, the incorporation of copper generates basic sites relatively stronger than those of TiO 2 38 so that a larger amount of CO 2 can be adsorbed by the catalyst. (Fig. 6) shows a comparison among the peak amounts of the main conversion products obtained with various catalysts.Differently from the results obtained with the unsupported samples, acetaldehyde and not formaldehyde was the main compound produced in the presence of HP1/SiO 2 and 1Cu-HP1/SiO 2 .The amount of acetaldehyde increased with the irradiation time and reached 0.35 and 0.5 mol/g-cat, respectively, after 6 hours of irradiation.Methane (ca.0.04 mol/g-cat), methanol and propanone (0.02 mol/gcat) were also obtained, but their amounts remained almost constant throughout the runs.The presence of 1 wt of copper enhanced the yield of acetaldehyde but 2Cu-HP1/SiO 2 was much less active, producing only a small amount of methane. The formation of acetaldehyde is probably favoured by the high dispersion state of TiO 2 and the largest specific surface area of the Acetaldehyde was also obtained in the presence of HP-rutile along with methane as main products of the reaction.Anyway, the maximum amount of acetaldehyde obtained with HP1/SiO 2 was about 3.3 times higher than that detected with HP-rutile whereas the methane yield was practically the same. Thermodynamically, the reduction of CO 2 requires that the bottom energy level of the conduction band of the semiconductor is more negative than the reduction potential of the various processes that lead to the reduced products.(Fig. 7) shows the alignment of the conduction bands of anatase 39 and rutile 40 with the reduction potentials of the possible reactions that can occur in the reduction of CO 2 41.All potentials are referred to the normal hydrogen electrode at pH 7.Only the formation of methane is energetically possible in the presence of rutile and this justifies the absence of formaldehyde that is instead the main compound obtained with the HP1 samples that prevalently consist of anatase. The photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 to organic compounds is quite complex and most of the researchers have hypothesized multielectron transfer processes to obtain the final hydrogenated products 4,8,17,424344. The formation of formaldehyde and/or methane can be justified by a mechanism proposed by Subrahmanyam et al. 42.UV irradiation of TiO 2 generates electron-hole pairs according to Eq. ( 1): In the absence of molecular oxygen, H can be reduced to H: Hydrogen atoms can combine to give hydrogen molecules or react with CO 2 to give formic acid: Formic acid can react with H giving formaldehyde that can be reduced to methanol: Finally, methanol can be reduced to methane: Acetaldehyde could be formed by reaction between CH 3 and formaldehyde: The kind of obtained products depends on the nature of the catalyst and on the experimental conditions such as H 2 O/CO 2 ratio, UV wavelength, light intensity, reaction medium and reactor configuration. The experimental results seem to suggest that the reaction (10), involving the formation of a C-C bond and leading to acetaldehyde through the reaction (11), occurs preferentially on photocatalysts with relatively high specific surface areas (HP-rutile, HP1/SiO 2 samples) since the interactions among the adsorbed precursor species should be statistically favoured on a larger surface. (Fig. 8) shows the peak amounts of the main conversion products obtained in the presence of the HP2 samples and water vapour.Methane was the main compound detected by using bare HP2.Its concentration increased during the run reaching ca.3.1 mol/g-cat after 6 h of irradiation.Also formaldehyde and acetaldehyde were formed, albeit their concentration increased to ca. 0.85 and 0.3 mol/g-cat respectively after 1.5 hours and then decreased to ca. 0.2 mol/g-cat after 6 hours of irradiation.The yields of formaldehyde and methane dramatically decreased if HP2 was loaded with 2 of copper or supported on mesoporous SBA silica.These results apparently disagree with those reported by Wu and coworkers who prevalently obtained methanol with samples prepared in a similar way.Anyway, it is worth noting that the reaction system was often completely different (photoreactor with TiO 2 coated optical fibers 35,36, UVC light as irradiation source 10,22) or CO 2 photoreduction occurred in an aqueous solution 9 rather than in vapour phase."}], "reactor type": [], "operation mode": [{"llm generation": "Batch", "source": "The photocatalytic runs were carried out in a Pyrex batch gassolid reactor (V 100 mL) irradiated from the top by a 400 W medium pressure Hg lamp.", "context": "Four commercial TiO 2 powders were used: Merck, Evonik P25, Mirkat M211 and Hombikat PC500.Home prepared (HP) TiO 2 samples were obtained by using titanium(IV) chloride (TiCl 4 , Fluka 98) and titanium(IV) butoxide (Ti(OC 4 H 9 ) 4 , Sigma Aldrich 97) as the starting materials. TiCl 4 was slowly added to distilled water (molar ratio Ti/H 2 O 1:60; volume ratio 1:10) at room temperature.After ca. 12 h of continuous stirring, a clear solution was obtained.The solution was boiled for 2 h under agitation.This treatment produced a milky white TiO 2 dispersion that was dried under vacuum at 323 K.This sample was labeled as HP1. A composite TiO 2 /SiO 2 material was prepared in order to study the role of SiO 2 as support.10 g of commercial SiO 2 (Cabot) were added to 110 mL of the solution obtained by adding 10 ml of TiCl 4 to 100 ml of H 2 O.The stirred suspension was boiled for 2 h, cooled to room temperature and dried in a rotary evaporator.The sample was labeled as HP1/SiO 2 . Copper-loaded samples were prepared by adding the desired amount of CuCl 2 2H 2 O (Sigma Aldrich 99) to the aqueous TiCl 4 solution.Two samples were prepared with Cu percentage amounts of 1 and 2 wt with respect to TiO 2 .The codices used for these samples were 1Cu-HP1 and 2Cu-HP1, respectively.Copperloaded samples supported on SiO 2 by a procedure analogous to that described for the bare TiO 2 /SiO 2 were labeled as 1 and 2Cu-HP1/SiO 2 . 10 mL of TiCl 4 were slowly added to 50 ml of distilled water at room temperature.After ca. 15 min of continuous stirring, the clear obtained solution was sealed in a bottle and kept in an oven at 373 K for 48 h.The bottle was allowed to cool to room temperature and the resultant solid was recovered using a vacuum pump at 323 K.The sample was labeled HP-rutile. 15 mL of TiCl 4 were added dropwise to a solution containing 630 mL of demineralized water and 240 mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid.The solution obtained after continuous stirring was heated in a tightly closed glass bottle and aged at 373 K in an oven for 48 h.The resultant precipitate contained a mixture of brookite and rutile.Pure brookite nanoparticles were separated by peptization by removing many times the surnatant and adding water to restore the initial solution volume.After a few washings, a dispersion of brookite particles was obtained whilst the rutile phase remained as a precipitate.The dispersions containing the brookite particles were collected and dried under vacuum at 673 K.The sample was identified as HP-brookite. 6.8 mL of Ti(OC 4 H 9 ) 4 were added to a solution of 7.3 mL of anhydrous n-butanol (Sigma Aldrich 99.8) and 4.6 mL of acetic acid.The mixture was vigorously stirred for 1 h and the resultant solution was dried in an oven at 423 K.The recovered solid was calcined at 773 K for 0.5 h.The sample was labeled as HP2. A Cu-loaded sample, identified as 2Cu-HP2, was prepared by adding the desired amount of CuCl 2 2H 2 O to the solution containing anhydrous n-butanol, acetic acid and Ti(OC 4 H 9 ) 4 . A supported TiO 2 /SiO 2 sample was prepared following the same procedure of the sample HP2 by adding Santa Barbara amorphous silica-15 (SBA) 32 to the solution containing Ti(OC 4 H 9 ) 4 , n-butanol, acetic acid and CuCl 2 2H 2 O.This sample was labeled as HP2/SiO 2 -SBA. X-ray diffraction patterns of the powders were recorded at room temperature by an Ital Structures APD 2000 powder diffractometer using the Cu K radiation and a 2 scan rate of 2/min.The specific surface area (SSA) of the powders were determined in a Flow Sorb 2300 apparatus (Micromeritics) by using the single-point BET method.The samples were degassed for 0.5 h at 250 C prior to the measurement.SEM observations were obtained using a Philips XL30 ESEM microscope, operating at 25 kV on specimens upon which a thin layer of gold had been evaporated.An electron microprobe used in an energy dispersive mode (EDX) was employed to obtain information on the content of Cu loaded on the samples.UV-Vis spectra of the solid photocatalysts were obtained by diffuse reflectance spectroscopy using a Shimadzu UV-2401 PC instrument.BaSO 4 was used as a reference sample and the spectra were recorded in the range 200-800 nm. The photocatalytic runs were carried out in a Pyrex batch gassolid reactor (V 100 mL) irradiated from the top by a 400 W medium pressure Hg lamp.A water filter was positioned between the lamp and the photoreactor in order to cut the infrared radiation.0.5 g of catalyst powder were placed inside the photoreactor, and be-fore beginning any run, N 2 was flushed for some hours inside the system under UV irradiation in order to photodesorb possible impurities or carbon residues from the catalyst surface.Afterwards, the photoreactor was saturated with CO 2 and then a certain amount of water was injected in the reactor with a microsyringe.0.5 ml of the gaseous mixture were withdrawn at fixed irradiation times by using a gas-tight microsyringe.The evolution of the formed products was followed by a GC-2010 Shimadzu gas chromatograph equipped with a Phenomenex Zebron Wax-plus (30 m 0.32 m 0.53 m) column and a flame ionization detector, using He as the carrier gas."}]}}
