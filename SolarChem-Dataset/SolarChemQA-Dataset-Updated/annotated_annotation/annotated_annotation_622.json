The obtained samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using Cu K radiation in a Panalytical EMPYREAN.Diffraction angles were compared with International Centre for Diffraction Data Powder Diffraction Files (PDF) for phase identification.Mean crystallite sizes were calculated by using the Scherrer formula.The surface topography has been examined with a Park XE-100 atomic force microscope (AFM). Raman spectra were recorded at room temperature using a JASCO NRS-5000/7000 series spectrometer with an excitation wavelength of 532 nm.For Raman shift and band width determination, the most intense band of the anatase spectrum was fitted to an asymmetric variation of the pseudo-Voigt profile 22.Total transmittance T and reflectance R of the coatings were measured in the wavelength range between 250 and 1800 nm in a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 9 spectrometer equipped with an integrating sphere.Then, the absorptance A() was deduced using A() 100-T() -R() and the absorption coefficient has been calculated as (1/t) ln100/(T() R() 23, taking t as the film thickness on SLG or GF substrates. Gas-phase photocatalytic experiments were conducted in a continuous-flow mode.The TiO 2 -sputtered GF wafers were introduced in a stainless steel reactor with an effective volume of 280 mL and provided with a borosilicate glass window for irradiation.The reaction conditions were set at 2 bar and 50 C maintaining a CO 2 :H 2 O molar ratio of 7.25.In-line gas chromatography analyses (GC Agilent 7890A) were performed to quantify the reaction products every 22 min.The photocatalytic measurements were performed using four UV lamps of 6 W each ( max 365 nm), with a total irradiance of 27.95 Wm -2 under 400 nm (Fig. S1).Before starting the experiments, the reactor was firstly outgassed at 50 C and then purged with Ar (100 mL/min) for 1 h to remove any residual compounds weakly adsorbed on the catalyst surface.Then, the reactor was flushed with the CO 2 eH 2 O mixture for 1 h to establish an adsorption-desorption balance at the reaction temperature.Prior to illumination, the reactor was pressurized and kept at the reaction flow rate.All photocatalytic tests were carried out over an irradiation period of 18 h. Isotope tracer experiments were carried out in a 15.6 mL stainless steel reactor with a borosilicate glass window operated in batch mode.After outgassing, 13 CO 2 (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc., 99.2 13 C, 1 18 O) and H 2 O were introduced in the reactor at 50 C with a total pressure of 2 bar.After 30 min irradiation with a 6 W UV lamp ( max 365 nm), the gas was extracted to a quadrupole mass spectrometer (Pfeiffer OMNISTAR) for analysis (Fig. S2)."}, {"llm generation": "TiO2", "source": "The performance of TiO 2 -coated GF samples was evaluated in CO 2 photoreduction under UV light using water as electron donor.", "context": "XRD patterns of GF samples (Fig. 1) show clear diffraction peaks for TiO 2 area densities above ca. 2 g/m 2 .Below that charge, amorphous titania or crystalline structures with exceedingly small crystal size or mass percentage could be present but not observed by XRD.Otherwise, the characteristic diffraction peaks of the anatase phase are always detected, without any reflections that could be ascribed to other TiO 2 phases, as expected from the used deposition conditions 11.In SLG samples (Fig. S3), amorphous behaviour is observed for the thinnest films, although the limit for the appearance of diffraction peaks is lower than in GF samples.This suggests that the absence of these peaks in GF samples with lower titania contents is related either to the detection limit of the technique or to small crystalline domains, rather than to an amorphous coating.In order to shed light on this point, Raman spectra were recorded on GF samples.Fig. 2 reveals that peaks corresponding to vibrations of the anatase lattice at ca. 146 (E g ; strong), 195 (E g ; weak), 393 (B 1g ; medium), 512 (A 1g B 1g ; medium) and 634 (E g ; medium) 24, are present in all cases except for the sample with the lowest titania charge, which looks amorphous to Raman spectroscopy too 25. Regarding structural aspects, details of the (101) peak measured for the various SLG samples (see Fig. S4A) reveal that the position of the peak changes slowly towards lower diffraction angles as the film thickness increases.By comparing the interplanar spacing, d, for each sample with the standard anatase value (ICDD PDF 00-021-1272), d 0 , it can be pointed out that the TiO 2 coatings show compressive structural distortion, (dd 0 )/d 0 0, which is about 0.7 for t 0.25 m and decreases to 0.1 for t 1.79 m.A similar observation can be made regarding the GF samples (Fig. S4B), although the 2 displacement is not monotonic.About the structural distortion origins, it should be noted that some tensile strain is expected to act by the grain coalescence mechanism that is common to any thin film regardless of the synthesis technique or the material 26, together with compressive stress linked to the incorporation of high energy atoms or particles that depend on the specific deposition conditions 26,27.The structural distortion observed experimentally results from the competition between such independent mechanisms, and the compressive strain predominates for the thinnest TiO 2 coatings in the present deposition conditions.Small variations are found in average crystallite sizes for both GF and SLG samples (27 2, 30 1 nm, respectively) without a clear trend against TiO 2 charge.A phonon confinement analysis 28 of the anatase Raman band at ca. 146 cm -1 was carried out by representing Raman shifts () and band widths () against the reciprocal of crystal size (1/S) and fitting the corresponding points to the equations: 1.55 (1) The fittings (Fig. S5) reveal that both vary with crystal size as expected from phonon confinement, indicating that no further defects, apart from those inherent to the nanostructure, are introduced by the present preparation method, in good accordance with XRD observations. Previous works of TiO 2 deposited over SLG have shown good adhesion properties and the root mean square roughness shows a correlation with the porosity 11.Here, in the case of the coatings deposited on glass fibre, even when a good distribution of the catalyst is apparent to the naked eye (Fig. 3A: blue-grey colour under UV light is indicative of reduced TiO 2 ), a detailed SEM characterization (Fig. 3B-C), together with AFM images (Fig. S6), reveal that such distribution is not homogenous, leading to the formation of TiO 2 aggregates.Therefore, due to the porous nature of the support, the film thickness and grain size are less homogeneous on GF with respect to SLG samples.Nevertheless, this porosity facilitates the reagents transport and allows an intimate interaction with the photocatalysts.Fig. S7A shows the absorptance spectra obtained for the various TiO 2 coatings on the GF substrates.For the thickest TiO 2 samples, the absorptance falls abruptly below 3.5 eV, but it starts to decrease slowly at higher energies when the coating thickness is diminished.The absorption coefficient corresponding to the same samples is represented in Fig. S7B, where it can be seen that higher values are achieved with the lightest TiO 2 coatings.Such increment in the absorption coefficient is observed in the overall radiation spectra and thus it should be related to additional absorption by surface defects and grain boundaries, which are proportionally more abundant in thinner coatings, as it is illustrated by the AFM images shown in Fig. S6.Taking into account that UV lamps ( max 365 nm) have been used for the photoreduction experiments, the absorptance and the absorption coefficient at such wavelength (named A365 nm and 365 nm) have been represented as a function of the TiO 2 area density in Fig. 4.This evidences the fast variation occurring with low TiO 2 charges, and then a slower evolution with the thicker coatings.Then, the highest absorption coefficients correspond The performance of TiO 2 -coated GF samples was evaluated in CO 2 photoreduction under UV light using water as electron donor.The main reaction products are CO and CH 3 OH plus trace amounts of CH 4 , along with H 2 coming from H 2 O reduction competing with CO 2 for conduction band electrons.No products were found after performing blank reactions without any catalyst under dark and UV-vis illumination, or in the presence of catalyst in dark conditions, discarding any CO 2 or H 2 O conversion due to thermal or photochemical reactions or to thermal catalysis.Previous studies using powdered anatase TiO 2 photocatalysts in the same reaction conditions have also shown high selectivities towards the formation of syngas (CO H 2 ) 30,31. Fig. 5(A-C) shows the kinetic profiles of the main products for all catalysts.The maximum production rates of CO are reached between 3 and 6 h of irradiation depending on the sample.On the other hand, H 2 and CH 3 OH show a quasi-stable rate in most of the samples.As a general trend, the evolution of the products is more stable in time with the smaller catalyst charges, while with high area densities the production decreases with time. The cumulative outcomes of the different reaction products over the whole studied period, obtained by integration of the kinetic curves, are gathered in Table 2.In order to compare overall photocatalytic activities regardless of the product distribution, the value \"C-products\" is defined as the molar sum of the CO 2 reduction products, and represents the total CO 2 moles converted into products.An initial comparison of Cproducts with the different samples reveals that the photocatalytic performance of the TiO 2 coating exhibits a high dependence on the catalyst area density even if the activities are referred to the catalyst mass unit.Thus, an optimum value is achieved with the GF3 sample which contains TiO 2 surface density of ca. 1 g/m 2 .Below and above this value, lower conversions are observed.In addition, the lower and upper surface density limits, represented by samples GF1 and GF7, give rise to similar CO 2 conversions.Counteracting effects seem therefore to account for the observed order of activities.The structural characterization discussed above revealed that the lower TiO 2 charge limit results in an amorphous or quasi-amorphous coating, and that crystallinity-related features are better resolved as the area density, or the films thickness in SLG samples, increases.On the other hand, Fig. 4C has revealed that the absorption coefficient decreases in the GF1 GF7 series.The optimal area density value appears thus as a compromise situation between these factors.This optimal catalyst coverage has significant implications in process scale-up 32.Under the present conditions, the obtained overall apparent quantum yields vary from 0.002 to 0.03, which is of the same order than previously reported results of CO 2 photoreduction over TiO 2 33343536, although the values reported in the literature vary not only with the type of catalyst, but also with reactor configuration, reaction conditions and irradiation sources. The highest selectivity is observed towards CO production except in the case of GF1 catalyst (Fig. 5D).This behaviour in the CO 2 reduction reaction has been previously observed by these authors and is a usual outcome when using oxide photocatalysts without a metallic co-catalyst 30,31,37.However, the product distribution is highly dependent on the characteristics of the coatings.With high area densities, selectivities to different carbon products are similar to those obtained with powdered TiO 2 catalysts 31, with CO representing more than 90 of the carbon-containing products, a small proportion of methanol and even smaller of methane.However, this situation changes with the lightest TiO 2 coatings, and in the GF1 sample methanol selectivity reaches 16 of all products, which represents nearly 30 of the C-containing ones.As explained above, XRD and Raman studies have depicted that this sample exhibits an amorphous nature or extremely small crystals.In this respect, the existence of low-coordinated Ti cations in amorphous titania has been postulated from theoretical studies as well as from Xray absorption and electron paramagnetic resonance results 383940.In line with this, the cation coordination number (N c ), estimated for the present amorphous and crystalline samples obtained on SLG substrates through the analysis of the reflectance interferences 414243 (Fig. S8) by the parametrization of the refractive index by means of the dispersion equation given by the Wemple-DiDomenico oscillator model: where n is the refractive index (Fig. S8A), E 0 is the single oscillator energy, E d the dispersion energy, and E the photon energy.The dispersion energy is attained from the linear fits plotted in Fig. S8B, as it contains information about density and coordination number in the films considered as a mixture of amorphous and crystalline phases, through the relation: where is the density, and subscripts a and x refer to amorphous and crystalline phases, respectively.For the present samples, the N ca values shown in Fig. S8 B have been calculated from the bulk TiO 2 values N cx 6.0,E dx 24.96eV and the packing density of each film a / x P (n 550 -1)/1.6,taken the n-value at 550 nm wavelength.In the case of the SLG1 sample, enough maxima were not obtained for calculation.Overestimation of N c in thick samples is common to the method 41.Therefore, the thickest coatings have not been included in Fig. S8B.These studies suggest a decrease in Nc for the thinnest cases.It has been argued that isolated TiO 2 particles, with a relatively high proportion of tetrahedrally coordinated Ti centres, favour the formation of methanol in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reactions, both in powders and in thin films 44,45, which has been related to improved charge transfer and low concentration of surface OH groups.The change in selectivity observed here with the lightest coatings may therefore be related to the amorphicity or small size of the TiO 2 structures improving the charge transfer processes and the production of highly electrondemanding products such as methanol.Further experiments were performed to assure that the observed production is due to carbon dioxide and does not arise from carboncontaining impurities present in the samples.The presence of these impurities was first ruled out by elemental analysis (Table S1).In line with this, 13 CO 2 photocatalytic reduction followed by mass spectrometric analysis (Fig. 6) shows an increase in the ratio between the ions with mass 29 ( 13 CO ) and 45 ( 13 CO 2 ).This ratio is 0.18 when directly measuring the mass spectrum of the 13 CO 2 cylinder, while it increases to 0.31 when 13 CO 2 is introduced in the photoreactor and the reactor content is analyzed after the photocatalytic reduction.This increase is attributed to the formation of 13 CO. Taking into account that Raman spectroscopy is a surface sensitive technique, a series of spectra were acquired to determine the surface changes and adsorbed species before and after reaction (Fig. 7).Raman experiments in fresh samples show that TiO 2 surface is covered by different carbon species adsorbed from its contact with ambient air.The observed bands are assigned to bidentate carbonate beCO 3 2-at 1045, 51.The formation of peroxo species on TiO 2 as a pathway for the oxygen evolution reaction has been previously reported in photoredox reaction literature 51525354.In addition, Sayama et al. proposed a speculative mechanism for oxygen evolution in CO 2 photoreduction via peroxocarbonate species 55, which may act as hole scavengers 56,57.However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that peroxocarbonates are detected by spectroscopic techniques for this reaction on TiO 2 .These experiments lead us to conclude that the generation of both peroxo and peroxocarbonate species arising from hole capture by CO 3 2-and HCO 3 -species could prevent H 2 O from being further oxidized into free O 2 .The accumulation of these peroxidized species on TiO 2 surface could also cause its deactivation."}, {"llm generation": "TiO 2", "source": "DC magnetron sputtering has demonstrated to be a highly applicable technique for the deposition of TiO 2 coatings for CO 2 photocatalytic reduction.", "context": "DC magnetron sputtering has demonstrated to be a highly applicable technique for the deposition of TiO 2 coatings for CO 2 photocatalytic reduction.Structural and optoelectronic characterization reveals that decreasing catalyst area density leads to crystalline coatings down to a limit below which the deposited material appears to be amorphous, which also influences the light absorption properties of the catalytic system.Performance tests in gas-phase photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reveals an optimum area density of 1 g/m 2 in terms of CO 2 conversion, which is ascribed to compromise situation between crystallinity and absorption coefficient.In turn, selectivities towards the different reaction products is also highly influenced by the TiO 2 loading, with amorphous or quasi-amorphous coatings favouring methanol formation in contrast with the preferred CO evolution in the rest of cases.Therefore, this technique opens up the possibility of not only optimizing catalyst usage towards an industrial implementation in terms of overall CO 2 reduction outcome, but also tuning the selectivity of the process at the expense of conversion.Raman spectroscopy reveals the formation of peroxo and peroxocarbonate species on the surface of the photocatalyst during the CO 2 reduction reaction, which could prevent H 2 O, CO 3 2-and HCO 3 -from being further oxidized into free O 2 .The accumulation of these species on TiO 2 surface could also cause its deactivation.

Isotope tracer experiments were carried out in a 15.6 mL stainless steel reactor with a borosilicate glass window operated in batch mode.After outgassing, 13 CO 2 (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc., 99.2 13 C, 1 18 O) and H 2 O were introduced in the reactor at 50 C with a total pressure of 2 bar.After 30 min irradiation with a 6 W UV lamp ( max 365 nm), the gas was extracted to a quadrupole mass spectrometer (Pfeiffer OMNISTAR) for analysis (Fig. S2)."}, {"llm generation": "UV", "source": "The performance of TiO 2 -coated GF samples was evaluated in CO 2 photoreduction under UV light using water as electron donor.", "context": "XRD patterns of GF samples (Fig. 1) show clear diffraction peaks for TiO 2 area densities above ca. 2 g/m 2 .Below that charge, amorphous titania or crystalline structures with exceedingly small crystal size or mass percentage could be present but not observed by XRD.Otherwise, the characteristic diffraction peaks of the anatase phase are always detected, without any reflections that could be ascribed to other TiO 2 phases, as expected from the used deposition conditions 11.In SLG samples (Fig. S3), amorphous behaviour is observed for the thinnest films, although the limit for the appearance of diffraction peaks is lower than in GF samples.This suggests that the absence of these peaks in GF samples with lower titania contents is related either to the detection limit of the technique or to small crystalline domains, rather than to an amorphous coating.In order to shed light on this point, Raman spectra were recorded on GF samples.Fig. 2 reveals that peaks corresponding to vibrations of the anatase lattice at ca. 146 (E g ; strong), 195 (E g ; weak), 393 (B 1g ; medium), 512 (A 1g B 1g ; medium) and 634 (E g ; medium) 24, are present in all cases except for the sample with the lowest titania charge, which looks amorphous to Raman spectroscopy too 25. Regarding structural aspects, details of the (101) peak measured for the various SLG samples (see Fig. S4A) reveal that the position of the peak changes slowly towards lower diffraction angles as the film thickness increases.By comparing the interplanar spacing, d, for each sample with the standard anatase value (ICDD PDF 00-021-1272), d 0 , it can be pointed out that the TiO 2 coatings show compressive structural distortion, (dd 0 )/d 0 0, which is about 0.7 for t 0.25 m and decreases to 0.1 for t 1.79 m.A similar observation can be made regarding the GF samples (Fig. S4B), although the 2 displacement is not monotonic.About the structural distortion origins, it should be noted that some tensile strain is expected to act by the grain coalescence mechanism that is common to any thin film regardless of the synthesis technique or the material 26, together with compressive stress linked to the incorporation of high energy atoms or particles that depend on the specific deposition conditions 26,27.The structural distortion observed experimentally results from the competition between such independent mechanisms, and the compressive strain predominates for the thinnest TiO 2 coatings in the present deposition conditions.Small variations are found in average crystallite sizes for both GF and SLG samples (27 2, 30 1 nm, respectively) without a clear trend against TiO 2 charge.A phonon confinement analysis 28 of the anatase Raman band at ca. 146 cm -1 was carried out by representing Raman shifts () and band widths () against the reciprocal of crystal size (1/S) and fitting the corresponding points to the equations: 1.55 (1) The fittings (Fig. S5) reveal that both vary with crystal size as expected from phonon confinement, indicating that no further defects, apart from those inherent to the nanostructure, are introduced by the present preparation method, in good accordance with XRD observations. Previous works of TiO 2 deposited over SLG have shown good adhesion properties and the root mean square roughness shows a correlation with the porosity 11.Here, in the case of the coatings deposited on glass fibre, even when a good distribution of the catalyst is apparent to the naked eye (Fig. 3A: blue-grey colour under UV light is indicative of reduced TiO 2 ), a detailed SEM characterization (Fig. 3B-C), together with AFM images (Fig. S6), reveal that such distribution is not homogenous, leading to the formation of TiO 2 aggregates.Therefore, due to the porous nature of the support, the film thickness and grain size are less homogeneous on GF with respect to SLG samples.Nevertheless, this porosity facilitates the reagents transport and allows an intimate interaction with the photocatalysts.Fig. S7A shows the absorptance spectra obtained for the various TiO 2 coatings on the GF substrates.For the thickest TiO 2 samples, the absorptance falls abruptly below 3.5 eV, but it starts to decrease slowly at higher energies when the coating thickness is diminished.The absorption coefficient corresponding to the same samples is represented in Fig. S7B, where it can be seen that higher values are achieved with the lightest TiO 2 coatings.Such increment in the absorption coefficient is observed in the overall radiation spectra and thus it should be related to additional absorption by surface defects and grain boundaries, which are proportionally more abundant in thinner coatings, as it is illustrated by the AFM images shown in Fig. S6.Taking into account that UV lamps ( max 365 nm) have been used for the photoreduction experiments, the absorptance and the absorption coefficient at such wavelength (named A365 nm and 365 nm) have been represented as a function of the TiO 2 area density in Fig. 4.This evidences the fast variation occurring with low TiO 2 charges, and then a slower evolution with the thicker coatings.Then, the highest absorption coefficients correspond The performance of TiO 2 -coated GF samples was evaluated in CO 2 photoreduction under UV light using water as electron donor.The main reaction products are CO and CH 3 OH plus trace amounts of CH 4 , along with H 2 coming from H 2 O reduction competing with CO 2 for conduction band electrons.No products were found after performing blank reactions without any catalyst under dark and UV-vis illumination, or in the presence of catalyst in dark conditions, discarding any CO 2 or H 2 O conversion due to thermal or photochemical reactions or to thermal catalysis.Previous studies using powdered anatase TiO 2 photocatalysts in the same reaction conditions have also shown high selectivities towards the formation of syngas (CO H 2 ) 30,31. Fig. 5(A-C) shows the kinetic profiles of the main products for all catalysts.The maximum production rates of CO are reached between 3 and 6 h of irradiation depending on the sample.On the other hand, H 2 and CH 3 OH show a quasi-stable rate in most of the samples.As a general trend, the evolution of the products is more stable in time with the smaller catalyst charges, while with high area densities the production decreases with time. The cumulative outcomes of the different reaction products over the whole studied period, obtained by integration of the kinetic curves, are gathered in Table 2.In order to compare overall photocatalytic activities regardless of the product distribution, the value \"C-products\" is defined as the molar sum of the CO 2 reduction products, and represents the total CO 2 moles converted into products.An initial comparison of Cproducts with the different samples reveals that the photocatalytic performance of the TiO 2 coating exhibits a high dependence on the catalyst area density even if the activities are referred to the catalyst mass unit.Thus, an optimum value is achieved with the GF3 sample which contains TiO 2 surface density of ca. 1 g/m 2 .Below and above this value, lower conversions are observed.In addition, the lower and upper surface density limits, represented by samples GF1 and GF7, give rise to similar CO 2 conversions.Counteracting effects seem therefore to account for the observed order of activities.The structural characterization discussed above revealed that the lower TiO 2 charge limit results in an amorphous or quasi-amorphous coating, and that crystallinity-related features are better resolved as the area density, or the films thickness in SLG samples, increases.On the other hand, Fig. 4C has revealed that the absorption coefficient decreases in the GF1 GF7 series.The optimal area density value appears thus as a compromise situation between these factors.This optimal catalyst coverage has significant implications in process scale-up 32.Under the present conditions, the obtained overall apparent quantum yields vary from 0.002 to 0.03, which is of the same order than previously reported results of CO 2 photoreduction over TiO 2 33343536, although the values reported in the literature vary not only with the type of catalyst, but also with reactor configuration, reaction conditions and irradiation sources. The highest selectivity is observed towards CO production except in the case of GF1 catalyst (Fig. 5D).This behaviour in the CO 2 reduction reaction has been previously observed by these authors and is a usual outcome when using oxide photocatalysts without a metallic co-catalyst 30,31,37.However, the product distribution is highly dependent on the characteristics of the coatings.With high area densities, selectivities to different carbon products are similar to those obtained with powdered TiO 2 catalysts 31, with CO representing more than 90 of the carbon-containing products, a small proportion of methanol and even smaller of methane.However, this situation changes with the lightest TiO 2 coatings, and in the GF1 sample methanol selectivity reaches 16 of all products, which represents nearly 30 of the C-containing ones.As explained above, XRD and Raman studies have depicted that this sample exhibits an amorphous nature or extremely small crystals.In this respect, the existence of low-coordinated Ti cations in amorphous titania has been postulated from theoretical studies as well as from Xray absorption and electron paramagnetic resonance results 383940.In line with this, the cation coordination number (N c ), estimated for the present amorphous and crystalline samples obtained on SLG substrates through the analysis of the reflectance interferences 414243 (Fig. S8) by the parametrization of the refractive index by means of the dispersion equation given by the Wemple-DiDomenico oscillator model: where n is the refractive index (Fig. S8A), E 0 is the single oscillator energy, E d the dispersion energy, and E the photon energy.The dispersion energy is attained from the linear fits plotted in Fig. S8B, as it contains information about density and coordination number in the films considered as a mixture of amorphous and crystalline phases, through the relation: where is the density, and subscripts a and x refer to amorphous and crystalline phases, respectively.For the present samples, the N ca values shown in Fig. S8 B have been calculated from the bulk TiO 2 values N cx 6.0,E dx 24.96eV and the packing density of each film a / x P (n 550 -1)/1.6,taken the n-value at 550 nm wavelength.In the case of the SLG1 sample, enough maxima were not obtained for calculation.Overestimation of N c in thick samples is common to the method 41.Therefore, the thickest coatings have not been included in Fig. S8B.These studies suggest a decrease in Nc for the thinnest cases.It has been argued that isolated TiO 2 particles, with a relatively high proportion of tetrahedrally coordinated Ti centres, favour the formation of methanol in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reactions, both in powders and in thin films 44,45, which has been related to improved charge transfer and low concentration of surface OH groups.The change in selectivity observed here with the lightest coatings may therefore be related to the amorphicity or small size of the TiO 2 structures improving the charge transfer processes and the production of highly electrondemanding products such as methanol.Further experiments were performed to assure that the observed production is due to carbon dioxide and does not arise from carboncontaining impurities present in the samples.The presence of these impurities was first ruled out by elemental analysis (Table S1).In line with this, 13 CO 2 photocatalytic reduction followed by mass spectrometric analysis (Fig. 6) shows an increase in the ratio between the ions with mass 29 ( 13 CO ) and 45 ( 13 CO 2 ).This ratio is 0.18 when directly measuring the mass spectrum of the 13 CO 2 cylinder, while it increases to 0.31 when 13 CO 2 is introduced in the photoreactor and the reactor content is analyzed after the photocatalytic reduction.This increase is attributed to the formation of 13 CO. Taking into account that Raman spectroscopy is a surface sensitive technique, a series of spectra were acquired to determine the surface changes and adsorbed species before and after reaction (Fig. 7).Raman experiments in fresh samples show that TiO 2 surface is covered by different carbon species adsorbed from its contact with ambient air.The observed bands are assigned to bidentate carbonate beCO 3 2-at 1045, 51.The formation of peroxo species on TiO 2 as a pathway for the oxygen evolution reaction has been previously reported in photoredox reaction literature 51525354.In addition, Sayama et al. proposed a speculative mechanism for oxygen evolution in CO 2 photoreduction via peroxocarbonate species 55, which may act as hole scavengers 56,57.However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that peroxocarbonates are detected by spectroscopic techniques for this reaction on TiO 2 .These experiments lead us to conclude that the generation of both peroxo and peroxocarbonate species arising from hole capture by CO 3 2-and HCO 3 -species could prevent H 2 O from being further oxidized into free O 2 .The accumulation of these peroxidized species on TiO 2 surface could also cause its deactivation."}, {"llm generation": "UV", "source": "Fig. 3.

In addition, peaks at 924, 869 and 844 cm -1 were assigned by Nakamura et al. to the OeO vibrational mode of surface peroxo species Ti(O 2 ), physisorbed H 2 O 2 and surface hydroperoxo species TiOOH respectively production (mol g cat -1 ) for all catalysts in the CO 2 H 2 O reaction after 18 h of UV irradiation.1313 ( s CeO) and 1608 ( as CeO) cm -1 46,47; monodentate carbonate meCO 3 2-at 1284 ( s CeO) and 1576 ( as CeO) cm -1 47-49 and bicarbonate HCO 3 -at 1232 ( OH), 1445 ( s CO), 1556 ( as CeO) and 1648 ( as CeO) cm -1 46-48.After reaction, some changes are observed on the TiO 2 surface due to an increase of CO 3 2-and HCO 3 species.Furthermore, carbonate bands show a blue shift of c.a. 9 cm -1 probably due to structural rearrangements.It is worth highlighting the appearance of a new Raman band at 989 cm -1 corresponding to the OeO vibrational mode of peroxocarbonate species (CO 4 This work, developed under the HyMAP project, has received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (grant agreement No. 648319).The results reflect only the authors' view and the Agency is not responsible for any use that may be made of the information they contained.Further support has been received from the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness trough the SolarFuel (ENE2014-55071-JIN) and Ra-PHUEL (ENE2016-79608-C2-1-R) projects.F.F. thanks financial support from the Amarout-II PEOPLE-COFUND Marie Skodowska-Curie Action.Support from the Repsol Technology Centre is gratefully acknowledged.

The obtained samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using Cu K radiation in a Panalytical EMPYREAN.Diffraction angles were compared with International Centre for Diffraction Data Powder Diffraction Files (PDF) for phase identification.Mean crystallite sizes were calculated by using the Scherrer formula.The surface topography has been examined with a Park XE-100 atomic force microscope (AFM). Raman spectra were recorded at room temperature using a JASCO NRS-5000/7000 series spectrometer with an excitation wavelength of 532 nm.For Raman shift and band width determination, the most intense band of the anatase spectrum was fitted to an asymmetric variation of the pseudo-Voigt profile 22.Total transmittance T and reflectance R of the coatings were measured in the wavelength range between 250 and 1800 nm in a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 9 spectrometer equipped with an integrating sphere.Then, the absorptance A() was deduced using A() 100-T() -R() and the absorption coefficient has been calculated as (1/t) ln100/(T() R() 23, taking t as the film thickness on SLG or GF substrates. Gas-phase photocatalytic experiments were conducted in a continuous-flow mode.The TiO 2 -sputtered GF wafers were introduced in a stainless steel reactor with an effective volume of 280 mL and provided with a borosilicate glass window for irradiation.The reaction conditions were set at 2 bar and 50 C maintaining a CO 2 :H 2 O molar ratio of 7.25.In-line gas chromatography analyses (GC Agilent 7890A) were performed to quantify the reaction products every 22 min.The photocatalytic measurements were performed using four UV lamps of 6 W each ( max 365 nm), with a total irradiance of 27.95 Wm -2 under 400 nm (Fig. S1).Before starting the experiments, the reactor was firstly outgassed at 50 C and then purged with Ar (100 mL/min) for 1 h to remove any residual compounds weakly adsorbed on the catalyst surface.Then, the reactor was flushed with the CO 2 eH 2 O mixture for 1 h to establish an adsorption-desorption balance at the reaction temperature.Prior to illumination, the reactor was pressurized and kept at the reaction flow rate.All photocatalytic tests were carried out over an irradiation period of 18 h. Isotope tracer experiments were carried out in a 15.6 mL stainless steel reactor with a borosilicate glass window operated in batch mode.After outgassing, 13 CO 2 (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc., 99.2 13 C, 1 18 O) and H 2 O were introduced in the reactor at 50 C with a total pressure of 2 bar.After 30 min irradiation with a 6 W UV lamp ( max 365 nm), the gas was extracted to a quadrupole mass spectrometer (Pfeiffer OMNISTAR) for analysis (Fig. S2)."}]}}
