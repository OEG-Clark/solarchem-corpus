O, Ti, Pd and C elements are determined in 1.0 wt Pd/TiO2 catalyst by the XPS survey spectrum (Fig. 8a).The two peaks at 530.1 and 531.6 eV of O 1s spectrum in Fig. 8b are assigned to the lattice oxygen of TiO2 and the oxygen of hydroxide ions, respectively. 44The doublet at 458.5 and 464.4 eV respectively related to Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 supports Ti 4 . 45There are no peak shift and valence state changes for O 1s and Ti 2p spectrum between fresh and used catalyst.In Fig. 8d, the peaks at 335.1 and 340.2 eV corresponding to Pd 3d5/2 and Pd 3d3/2 respectively are attributed to metallic Pd and the rest at 336.2 and 341.8 eV ascribed to PdO. 46,47 The presence of PdO may be due to the surface oxidation in catalyst preparation and storage.Compared with the fresh catalyst, the peaks of PdO for the used sample are shifted down by 0.1 and 0.3 eV, respectively.This phenomenon indicates the generation of a new surface species Pd-C and the increased peak value at 284.6 eV of C 1s in Fig. 8a can also support this conclusion. 48,49The formation of Pd-C surface species is helpful to explain the reaction mechanism of photocatalytic CO2 hydrogenation. The photocatalytic function of catalysts was evaluated in a miniature visual autoclave under the pressure of 2.5 MPa with high-purity H2 and CO2 at a ratio of 4:1 sealed in the system.Typically, we found that the main product of CO2 hydrogenation is CH4 with a small amount of CO and C2H6, as shown in Fig. 9.The time courses of CH4, CO and C2H6 yields over Pd/TiO2 are presented in Fig. 9a-c respectively.The pure TiO2 show a poor photocatalytic activity towards CO2 hydrogenation throughout reaction course. However, for every composite, prolonged time allows a continual and fast growth of yields for each product.More importantly, Pd loading dependence of yield proves to be double-edged.Obviously, for all products, yields are on the increase to their optimal values below 1.0 wt loading (Fig. 9d).The highest value of CH4, CO, C2H6 can reach 355.62, 46.35 and 39.69 mol/g-cat respectively with the palladium content of 1.0 wt after irradiation for 3 h.This trend is closely related to remarkably boosted separation efficiency of charge carriers as PL result implies (Fig. 7), leaving more photons to run targeted reaction.On the other hand, excessive Pd are harmful to further increase in yields possibly due to formation of new recombination center or shielding effect of noble metal on TiO2 to inhibit light harvesting.In order to investigate the synergy effect between palladium nanoparticles and TiO2 during the photocatalytic CO2 hydrogenation, aluminium oxide was substituted for TiO2. The BET information of support and Pd-loaded support are summarized in Table 1. The specific surface area of TiO2 (83.45 m 2 /g) is slightly less than that of Al2O3 (97.92 m 2 /g), which can eliminate effects of specific surface area for the adsorption/concentration of CO2 molecules.There is a small decrease in specific surface area after loading palladium both for TiO2 and Al2O3, 61.82 m 2 /g for 1.0 wt Pd/TiO2 and 94.86 m 2 /g for 1.0 wt Pd/Al2O3, which can be attributed to covering effect of palladium nanoparticles on partial pores of supports.In order to investigate the dispersion of palladium nanoparticles on TiO2 and Al2O3, TEM images of 1.0 wt Pd/TiO2 and 1.0 wt Pd/Al2O3 are illustrated in Fig. S1.There is no much difference about the dispersion of palladium nanoparticles between 1.0 wt Pd/TiO2 and 1.0 wt Pd/Al2O3, ruling out that the enhanced photocatalytic process is not caused by better dispersion of palladium nanoparticles on TiO2.Aluminium oxide, a photocatalytic inert material, almost did not show any photocatalytic activity in our study, as shown in Fig. 10a. 25However, the yield of CH4 over 1.0 wt Pd/Al2O3 after irradiation for 3 h can reach 252.79 mol/g, which is about 13.72 times higher than that of pure Al2O3.This result can almost be seen as the performance of metal palladium independently.Pure TiO2 has a certain photocatalytic activity.It is obvious that 1.0 wt Pd/TiO2 exhibits the highest photocatalytic activity with 355.62 mol/g of CH4 after irradiation for 3 h, which is about 8.34 and 1.41 times higher than over pure TiO2 and palladium, respectively.It can be concluded from the above comparison that the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 supported Pd is beneficial from synergy effect between TiO2 and palladium instead of a simple superposition of their individual effects. The control experiment (Fig. 10b red line) was conducted in the absence of catalyst with otherwise identical conditions, which shows that a very small amount of CH4 was found, suggesting that the reaction of CO2 hydrogenation can occur without any catalysts.Photocatalytic CO2 hydrogenation over Pd-loading TiO2 is an enhanced reaction.In order to confirm CO2 as a carbon source of CH4, a blank experiment (Fig. The Journal of Physical Chemistry (Fig. 10d).Only a small amount of CH4 was found in this two processes, revealing that Pd-loading TiO2 is active in UV light, which is also evidenced by the UV-vis spectra.The structural stability of catalyst after reaction was investigated by characterizing the XRD (Fig. S2) and Raman spectrum (Fig. 6).No significant changes are found in the structure of used catalyst, meaning that the structure is highly stable. hydrogenation is a synergy between metal and support.There has been some reoprts that various metals will have different influence on the reaction of CO2 Page 20 of 34 The Journal of Physical Chemistry hydrogenation. 14,18,25Herein, six different metals (Pd, Pt, Ru, Rh, Ir, Ni) loaded on TiO2 were prepared with the same method (Fig. S3) to evaluate the photocatalytic activity for CO2 hydrogenation (Table 2).Compared with pure TiO2, in addition to the Ni-loaded TiO2, other samples prepared show different levels of activity increased. The adverse performance of Ni-loaded on TiO2 is possibly due to the decrease in specific surface area.We can see clearly that 1.0 wt Pd/TiO2 exhibits the top performance with the CH4 of 355.62 mol/g, the CO of 46.35 mol/g and the C2H6 of 39.69 mol/g after irradiation for 3 h.It may be explained by the adsorption of carbon dioxide, hydrogen evolution and plasma resonance effect of palladium nanoparticles. 25,39,50ble 2 Distribution and yield of each product from CO2 hydrogenation over different catalysts. aa Products (mol/g) c Catalyst b Metal loading (wt) refers to theoretical amount of noble metals loaded on the support. c Other hydrocarbons contain ethylene, propane and propylene and the yield of each product was calculated according to their standard curve respectively.

Based on the above analysis, a possible mechanism of photocatalytic CO2 hydrogenation was proposed (Fig. 11).Palladium plays a very important role in effective separation of photo generated charges.Electron transition from the valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB) of TiO2 under its exposure to UV and the photoelectrons will be further transferred to the palladium nanoparticles, promoting the reduction of carbon dioxide.The detailed process of reaction is as follows."}, {"llm generation": "TiO2", "source": "The specific surface area of TiO2 (83.45 m 2 /g) is slightly less than that of Al2O3 (97.92 m 2 /g), which can eliminate effects of specific surface area for the adsorption/concentration of CO2 molecules.", "context": "where , h, , A, Eg are the absorption coefficient, planck constant, light frequency, proportionality constant and band gap energy, respectively.For TiO2, n1 for direct transition. 42The band gap energies of TiO2 and Pd-loaded TiO2 are calculated in the The structural properties of metal oxide can be sensitively identified by the Raman spectrum.Fig. 6 provides Raman spectra of the TiO2 and Pd/TiO2 samples.For the TiO2 sample (Fig. 6a), the major Raman bands at 147, 198, 396, 515,519 (overlapped with the band of 515 cm -1 ) and 638 cm -1 can be assigned to the Eg(1), Eg(2), B1g(1), A1g, B1g(2), and Eg(3) modes of TiO2 anatase phase, respectively. 43The result of Raman spectra shows that both TiO2 and Pd/TiO2 sample are in the anatase phase, corresponding to the XRD results.The palladium-modified TiO2 (Fig. 6b) has the same Raman bands with those of the pure TiO2, indicating that palladium was loaded For the Pd/TiO2 after reaction (Fig. 6c), the unchanged peak position reveals that the catalyst remains original structure after reaction.To further investigate the element state and interaction between palladium nanoparticles and TiO2, XPS spectra were obtained and showed in Fig. 8. O, Ti, Pd and C elements are determined in 1.0 wt Pd/TiO2 catalyst by the XPS survey spectrum (Fig. 8a).The two peaks at 530.1 and 531.6 eV of O 1s spectrum in Fig. 8b are assigned to the lattice oxygen of TiO2 and the oxygen of hydroxide ions, respectively. 44The doublet at 458.5 and 464.4 eV respectively related to Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 supports Ti 4 . 45There are no peak shift and valence state changes for O 1s and Ti 2p spectrum between fresh and used catalyst.In Fig. 8d, the peaks at 335.1 and 340.2 eV corresponding to Pd 3d5/2 and Pd 3d3/2 respectively are attributed to metallic Pd and the rest at 336.2 and 341.8 eV ascribed to PdO. 46,47 The presence of PdO may be due to the surface oxidation in catalyst preparation and storage.Compared with the fresh catalyst, the peaks of PdO for the used sample are shifted down by 0.1 and 0.3 eV, respectively.This phenomenon indicates the generation of a new surface species Pd-C and the increased peak value at 284.6 eV of C 1s in Fig. 8a can also support this conclusion. 48,49The formation of Pd-C surface species is helpful to explain the reaction mechanism of photocatalytic CO2 hydrogenation. The photocatalytic function of catalysts was evaluated in a miniature visual autoclave under the pressure of 2.5 MPa with high-purity H2 and CO2 at a ratio of 4:1 sealed in the system.Typically, we found that the main product of CO2 hydrogenation is CH4 with a small amount of CO and C2H6, as shown in Fig. 9.The time courses of CH4, CO and C2H6 yields over Pd/TiO2 are presented in Fig. 9a-c respectively.The pure TiO2 show a poor photocatalytic activity towards CO2 hydrogenation throughout reaction course. However, for every composite, prolonged time allows a continual and fast growth of yields for each product.More importantly, Pd loading dependence of yield proves to be double-edged.Obviously, for all products, yields are on the increase to their optimal values below 1.0 wt loading (Fig. 9d).The highest value of CH4, CO, C2H6 can reach 355.62, 46.35 and 39.69 mol/g-cat respectively with the palladium content of 1.0 wt after irradiation for 3 h.This trend is closely related to remarkably boosted separation efficiency of charge carriers as PL result implies (Fig. 7), leaving more photons to run targeted reaction.On the other hand, excessive Pd are harmful to further increase in yields possibly due to formation of new recombination center or shielding effect of noble metal on TiO2 to inhibit light harvesting.In order to investigate the synergy effect between palladium nanoparticles and TiO2 during the photocatalytic CO2 hydrogenation, aluminium oxide was substituted for TiO2. The BET information of support and Pd-loaded support are summarized in Table 1. The specific surface area of TiO2 (83.45 m 2 /g) is slightly less than that of Al2O3 (97.92 m 2 /g), which can eliminate effects of specific surface area for the adsorption/concentration of CO2 molecules.There is a small decrease in specific surface area after loading palladium both for TiO2 and Al2O3, 61.82 m 2 /g for 1.0 wt Pd/TiO2 and 94.86 m 2 /g for 1.0 wt Pd/Al2O3, which can be attributed to covering effect of palladium nanoparticles on partial pores of supports.In order to investigate the dispersion of palladium nanoparticles on TiO2 and Al2O3, TEM images of 1.0 wt Pd/TiO2 and 1.0 wt Pd/Al2O3 are illustrated in Fig. S1.There is no much difference about the dispersion of palladium nanoparticles between 1.0 wt Pd/TiO2 and 1.0 wt Pd/Al2O3, ruling out that the enhanced photocatalytic process is not caused by better dispersion of palladium nanoparticles on TiO2.Aluminium oxide, a photocatalytic inert material, almost did not show any photocatalytic activity in our study, as shown in Fig. 10a. 25However, the yield of CH4 over 1.0 wt Pd/Al2O3 after irradiation for 3 h can reach 252.79 mol/g, which is about 13.72 times higher than that of pure Al2O3.This result can almost be seen as the performance of metal palladium independently.Pure TiO2 has a certain photocatalytic activity.It is obvious that 1.0 wt Pd/TiO2 exhibits the highest photocatalytic activity with 355.62 mol/g of CH4 after irradiation for 3 h, which is about 8.34 and 1.41 times higher than over pure TiO2 and palladium, respectively.It can be concluded from the above comparison that the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 supported Pd is beneficial from synergy effect between TiO2 and palladium instead of a simple superposition of their individual effects.

However, for every composite, prolonged time allows a continual and fast growth of yields for each product.More importantly, Pd loading dependence of yield proves to be double-edged.Obviously, for all products, yields are on the increase to their optimal values below 1.0 wt loading (Fig. 9d).The highest value of CH4, CO, C2H6 can reach 355.62, 46.35 and 39.69 mol/g-cat respectively with the palladium content of 1.0 wt after irradiation for 3 h.This trend is closely related to remarkably boosted separation efficiency of charge carriers as PL result implies (Fig. 7), leaving more photons to run targeted reaction.On the other hand, excessive Pd are harmful to further increase in yields possibly due to formation of new recombination center or shielding effect of noble metal on TiO2 to inhibit light harvesting.In order to investigate the synergy effect between palladium nanoparticles and TiO2 during the photocatalytic CO2 hydrogenation, aluminium oxide was substituted for TiO2. The BET information of support and Pd-loaded support are summarized in Table 1. The specific surface area of TiO2 (83.45 m 2 /g) is slightly less than that of Al2O3 (97.92 m 2 /g), which can eliminate effects of specific surface area for the adsorption/concentration of CO2 molecules.There is a small decrease in specific surface area after loading palladium both for TiO2 and Al2O3, 61.82 m 2 /g for 1.0 wt Pd/TiO2 and 94.86 m 2 /g for 1.0 wt Pd/Al2O3, which can be attributed to covering effect of palladium nanoparticles on partial pores of supports.In order to investigate the dispersion of palladium nanoparticles on TiO2 and Al2O3, TEM images of 1.0 wt Pd/TiO2 and 1.0 wt Pd/Al2O3 are illustrated in Fig. S1.There is no much difference about the dispersion of palladium nanoparticles between 1.0 wt Pd/TiO2 and 1.0 wt Pd/Al2O3, ruling out that the enhanced photocatalytic process is not caused by better dispersion of palladium nanoparticles on TiO2.Aluminium oxide, a photocatalytic inert material, almost did not show any photocatalytic activity in our study, as shown in Fig. 10a. 25However, the yield of CH4 over 1.0 wt Pd/Al2O3 after irradiation for 3 h can reach 252.79 mol/g, which is about 13.72 times higher than that of pure Al2O3.This result can almost be seen as the performance of metal palladium independently.Pure TiO2 has a certain photocatalytic activity.It is obvious that 1.0 wt Pd/TiO2 exhibits the highest photocatalytic activity with 355.62 mol/g of CH4 after irradiation for 3 h, which is about 8.34 and 1.41 times higher than over pure TiO2 and palladium, respectively.It can be concluded from the above comparison that the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 supported Pd is beneficial from synergy effect between TiO2 and palladium instead of a simple superposition of their individual effects. The control experiment (Fig. 10b red line) was conducted in the absence of catalyst with otherwise identical conditions, which shows that a very small amount of CH4 was found, suggesting that the reaction of CO2 hydrogenation can occur without any catalysts.Photocatalytic CO2 hydrogenation over Pd-loading TiO2 is an enhanced reaction.In order to confirm CO2 as a carbon source of CH4, a blank experiment (Fig. The Journal of Physical Chemistry (Fig. 10d).Only a small amount of CH4 was found in this two processes, revealing that Pd-loading TiO2 is active in UV light, which is also evidenced by the UV-vis spectra.The structural stability of catalyst after reaction was investigated by characterizing the XRD (Fig. S2) and Raman spectrum (Fig. 6).No significant changes are found in the structure of used catalyst, meaning that the structure is highly stable. hydrogenation is a synergy between metal and support.There has been some reoprts that various metals will have different influence on the reaction of CO2 Page 20 of 34 The Journal of Physical Chemistry hydrogenation. 14,18,25Herein, six different metals (Pd, Pt, Ru, Rh, Ir, Ni) loaded on TiO2 were prepared with the same method (Fig. S3) to evaluate the photocatalytic activity for CO2 hydrogenation (Table 2).Compared with pure TiO2, in addition to the Ni-loaded TiO2, other samples prepared show different levels of activity increased. The adverse performance of Ni-loaded on TiO2 is possibly due to the decrease in specific surface area.We can see clearly that 1.0 wt Pd/TiO2 exhibits the top performance with the CH4 of 355.62 mol/g, the CO of 46.35 mol/g and the C2H6 of 39.69 mol/g after irradiation for 3 h.It may be explained by the adsorption of carbon dioxide, hydrogen evolution and plasma resonance effect of palladium nanoparticles. 25,39,50ble 2 Distribution and yield of each product from CO2 hydrogenation over different catalysts. aa Products (mol/g) c Catalyst b Metal loading (wt) refers to theoretical amount of noble metals loaded on the support. c Other hydrocarbons contain ethylene, propane and propylene and the yield of each product was calculated according to their standard curve respectively.

The control experiment (Fig. 10b red line) was conducted in the absence of catalyst with otherwise identical conditions, which shows that a very small amount of CH4 was found, suggesting that the reaction of CO2 hydrogenation can occur without any catalysts.Photocatalytic CO2 hydrogenation over Pd-loading TiO2 is an enhanced reaction.In order to confirm CO2 as a carbon source of CH4, a blank experiment (Fig. The Journal of Physical Chemistry (Fig. 10d).Only a small amount of CH4 was found in this two processes, revealing that Pd-loading TiO2 is active in UV light, which is also evidenced by the UV-vis spectra.The structural stability of catalyst after reaction was investigated by characterizing the XRD (Fig. S2) and Raman spectrum (Fig. 6).No significant changes are found in the structure of used catalyst, meaning that the structure is highly stable. hydrogenation is a synergy between metal and support.There has been some reoprts that various metals will have different influence on the reaction of CO2 Page 20 of 34 The Journal of Physical Chemistry hydrogenation. 14,18,25Herein, six different metals (Pd, Pt, Ru, Rh, Ir, Ni) loaded on TiO2 were prepared with the same method (Fig. S3) to evaluate the photocatalytic activity for CO2 hydrogenation (Table 2).Compared with pure TiO2, in addition to the Ni-loaded TiO2, other samples prepared show different levels of activity increased. The adverse performance of Ni-loaded on TiO2 is possibly due to the decrease in specific surface area.We can see clearly that 1.0 wt Pd/TiO2 exhibits the top performance with the CH4 of 355.62 mol/g, the CO of 46.35 mol/g and the C2H6 of 39.69 mol/g after irradiation for 3 h.It may be explained by the adsorption of carbon dioxide, hydrogen evolution and plasma resonance effect of palladium nanoparticles. 25,39,50ble 2 Distribution and yield of each product from CO2 hydrogenation over different catalysts. aa Products (mol/g) c Catalyst b Metal loading (wt) refers to theoretical amount of noble metals loaded on the support. c Other hydrocarbons contain ethylene, propane and propylene and the yield of each product was calculated according to their standard curve respectively.

The photocatalytic function of catalysts was evaluated in a miniature visual autoclave under the pressure of 2.5 MPa with high-purity H2 and CO2 at a ratio of 4:1 sealed in the system.Typically, we found that the main product of CO2 hydrogenation is CH4 with a small amount of CO and C2H6, as shown in Fig. 9.The time courses of CH4, CO and C2H6 yields over Pd/TiO2 are presented in Fig. 9a-c respectively.The pure TiO2 show a poor photocatalytic activity towards CO2 hydrogenation throughout reaction course. However, for every composite, prolonged time allows a continual and fast growth of yields for each product.More importantly, Pd loading dependence of yield proves to be double-edged.Obviously, for all products, yields are on the increase to their optimal values below 1.0 wt loading (Fig. 9d).The highest value of CH4, CO, C2H6 can reach 355.62, 46.35 and 39.69 mol/g-cat respectively with the palladium content of 1.0 wt after irradiation for 3 h.This trend is closely related to remarkably boosted separation efficiency of charge carriers as PL result implies (Fig. 7), leaving more photons to run targeted reaction.On the other hand, excessive Pd are harmful to further increase in yields possibly due to formation of new recombination center or shielding effect of noble metal on TiO2 to inhibit light harvesting.In order to investigate the synergy effect between palladium nanoparticles and TiO2 during the photocatalytic CO2 hydrogenation, aluminium oxide was substituted for TiO2.

The specific surface area of TiO2 (83.45 m 2 /g) is slightly less than that of Al2O3 (97.92 m 2 /g), which can eliminate effects of specific surface area for the adsorption/concentration of CO2 molecules.There is a small decrease in specific surface area after loading palladium both for TiO2 and Al2O3, 61.82 m 2 /g for 1.0 wt Pd/TiO2 and 94.86 m 2 /g for 1.0 wt Pd/Al2O3, which can be attributed to covering effect of palladium nanoparticles on partial pores of supports.In order to investigate the dispersion of palladium nanoparticles on TiO2 and Al2O3, TEM images of 1.0 wt Pd/TiO2 and 1.0 wt Pd/Al2O3 are illustrated in Fig. S1.There is no much difference about the dispersion of palladium nanoparticles between 1.0 wt Pd/TiO2 and 1.0 wt Pd/Al2O3, ruling out that the enhanced photocatalytic process is not caused by better dispersion of palladium nanoparticles on TiO2.Aluminium oxide, a photocatalytic inert material, almost did not show any photocatalytic activity in our study, as shown in Fig. 10a. 25However, the yield of CH4 over 1.0 wt Pd/Al2O3 after irradiation for 3 h can reach 252.79 mol/g, which is about 13.72 times higher than that of pure Al2O3.This result can almost be seen as the performance of metal palladium independently.Pure TiO2 has a certain photocatalytic activity.It is obvious that 1.0 wt Pd/TiO2 exhibits the highest photocatalytic activity with 355.62 mol/g of CH4 after irradiation for 3 h, which is about 8.34 and 1.41 times higher than over pure TiO2 and palladium, respectively.It can be concluded from the above comparison that the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 supported Pd is beneficial from synergy effect between TiO2 and palladium instead of a simple superposition of their individual effects. The control experiment (Fig. 10b red line) was conducted in the absence of catalyst with otherwise identical conditions, which shows that a very small amount of CH4 was found, suggesting that the reaction of CO2 hydrogenation can occur without any catalysts.Photocatalytic CO2 hydrogenation over Pd-loading TiO2 is an enhanced reaction.In order to confirm CO2 as a carbon source of CH4, a blank experiment (Fig. The Journal of Physical Chemistry (Fig. 10d).Only a small amount of CH4 was found in this two processes, revealing that Pd-loading TiO2 is active in UV light, which is also evidenced by the UV-vis spectra.The structural stability of catalyst after reaction was investigated by characterizing the XRD (Fig. S2) and Raman spectrum (Fig. 6).No significant changes are found in the structure of used catalyst, meaning that the structure is highly stable. hydrogenation is a synergy between metal and support.There has been some reoprts that various metals will have different influence on the reaction of CO2 Page 20 of 34 The Journal of Physical Chemistry hydrogenation. 14,18,25Herein, six different metals (Pd, Pt, Ru, Rh, Ir, Ni) loaded on TiO2 were prepared with the same method (Fig. S3) to evaluate the photocatalytic activity for CO2 hydrogenation (Table 2).Compared with pure TiO2, in addition to the Ni-loaded TiO2, other samples prepared show different levels of activity increased. The adverse performance of Ni-loaded on TiO2 is possibly due to the decrease in specific surface area.We can see clearly that 1.0 wt Pd/TiO2 exhibits the top performance with the CH4 of 355.62 mol/g, the CO of 46.35 mol/g and the C2H6 of 39.69 mol/g after irradiation for 3 h.It may be explained by the adsorption of carbon dioxide, hydrogen evolution and plasma resonance effect of palladium nanoparticles. 25,39,50ble 2 Distribution and yield of each product from CO2 hydrogenation over different catalysts. aa Products (mol/g) c Catalyst b Metal loading (wt) refers to theoretical amount of noble metals loaded on the support. c Other hydrocarbons contain ethylene, propane and propylene and the yield of each product was calculated according to their standard curve respectively.

The chemical composition of samples was determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, 2000 XPS system with a monochromatic Al-Ka source).All binding energies were normalized to the C 1s peak at 284.6 eV. The photocatalytic reaction was carried out in a miniature visual autoclave with the total volume of 250 cm 3 and the schematic illustration of the experimental setup is shown in Fig. 1.The reactor was equipped with a quartz glass window of 10 mm thickness to pass light irradiation from the reflector lamp.No other heating devices have been used in the whole experiment and a 150 W mercury lamp serves as the only heat and UV-light supplier.Prior to use, the catalyst should be dried in a vacuum at 60 o C for 2 h and fully ground to ensure an excellent dispersion.A layer of silver paper was employed inside the lining of reactor in order to focus the light.Typically, 0.5 g of silica wool as catalyst support, was distributed inside the reactor and the bottom of the reactor was set aside a certain space to magnetically stir for gas flow.Furthermore, 0.1 g of powdered photocatalyst was uniformly dispersed onto the silica wool to ensure that light was used efficiently.The reactor was purged by nitrogen for 30 min with the gas outlet valve open to remove the air completely.After that, the hydrogen and carbon dioxide with the ratio of 4:1 were introduced until the reactor reached a The morphology and particle size of the TiO2 and 1.0 wt Pd/TiO2 are investigated via SEM and TEM, as shown in Fig. 3.It can be clearly seen that pure TiO2 is consist of spherical aggregates of small sub-particles, which are homogeneous in size and shape (Fig. 3a).The size of TiO2 is estimated to have an average diameter of 30-40 nm (Fig. 3c).In Fig. 3b, palladium nanoparticles loaded on the surface of TiO2 are clearly observed.Noticeably, a comparative observation between Fig. 3a and Fig. 3b disclose morphological maintenance by Pd loading.The additional information With the increasing of Pd loading, the samples exhibit better optical response ability and the absorbance at the range of 380-700 nm is much higher than the pure TiO2.This phenomenon can be attributed to the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of Pd nanoparticles, which will have an influence on the surface charge distribution of TiO2, further causing the change in the particle energy gap.The band gap of the samples can be calculated on the basis of the following empirical formulas:"}, {"llm generation": "UV light", "source": "Only a small amount of CH4 was found in this two processes, revealing that Pd-loading TiO2 is active in UV light, which is also evidenced by the UV-vis spectra.", "context": "where , h, , A, Eg are the absorption coefficient, planck constant, light frequency, proportionality constant and band gap energy, respectively.For TiO2, n1 for direct transition. 42The band gap energies of TiO2 and Pd-loaded TiO2 are calculated in the The structural properties of metal oxide can be sensitively identified by the Raman spectrum.Fig. 6 provides Raman spectra of the TiO2 and Pd/TiO2 samples.For the TiO2 sample (Fig. 6a), the major Raman bands at 147, 198, 396, 515,519 (overlapped with the band of 515 cm -1 ) and 638 cm -1 can be assigned to the Eg(1), Eg(2), B1g(1), A1g, B1g(2), and Eg(3) modes of TiO2 anatase phase, respectively. 43The result of Raman spectra shows that both TiO2 and Pd/TiO2 sample are in the anatase phase, corresponding to the XRD results.The palladium-modified TiO2 (Fig. 6b) has the same Raman bands with those of the pure TiO2, indicating that palladium was loaded For the Pd/TiO2 after reaction (Fig. 6c), the unchanged peak position reveals that the catalyst remains original structure after reaction.To further investigate the element state and interaction between palladium nanoparticles and TiO2, XPS spectra were obtained and showed in Fig. 8. O, Ti, Pd and C elements are determined in 1.0 wt Pd/TiO2 catalyst by the XPS survey spectrum (Fig. 8a).The two peaks at 530.1 and 531.6 eV of O 1s spectrum in Fig. 8b are assigned to the lattice oxygen of TiO2 and the oxygen of hydroxide ions, respectively. 44The doublet at 458.5 and 464.4 eV respectively related to Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 supports Ti 4 . 45There are no peak shift and valence state changes for O 1s and Ti 2p spectrum between fresh and used catalyst.In Fig. 8d, the peaks at 335.1 and 340.2 eV corresponding to Pd 3d5/2 and Pd 3d3/2 respectively are attributed to metallic Pd and the rest at 336.2 and 341.8 eV ascribed to PdO. 46,47 The presence of PdO may be due to the surface oxidation in catalyst preparation and storage.Compared with the fresh catalyst, the peaks of PdO for the used sample are shifted down by 0.1 and 0.3 eV, respectively.This phenomenon indicates the generation of a new surface species Pd-C and the increased peak value at 284.6 eV of C 1s in Fig. 8a can also support this conclusion. 48,49The formation of Pd-C surface species is helpful to explain the reaction mechanism of photocatalytic CO2 hydrogenation. The photocatalytic function of catalysts was evaluated in a miniature visual autoclave under the pressure of 2.5 MPa with high-purity H2 and CO2 at a ratio of 4:1 sealed in the system.Typically, we found that the main product of CO2 hydrogenation is CH4 with a small amount of CO and C2H6, as shown in Fig. 9.The time courses of CH4, CO and C2H6 yields over Pd/TiO2 are presented in Fig. 9a-c respectively.The pure TiO2 show a poor photocatalytic activity towards CO2 hydrogenation throughout reaction course. However, for every composite, prolonged time allows a continual and fast growth of yields for each product.More importantly, Pd loading dependence of yield proves to be double-edged.Obviously, for all products, yields are on the increase to their optimal values below 1.0 wt loading (Fig. 9d).The highest value of CH4, CO, C2H6 can reach 355.62, 46.35 and 39.69 mol/g-cat respectively with the palladium content of 1.0 wt after irradiation for 3 h.This trend is closely related to remarkably boosted separation efficiency of charge carriers as PL result implies (Fig. 7), leaving more photons to run targeted reaction.On the other hand, excessive Pd are harmful to further increase in yields possibly due to formation of new recombination center or shielding effect of noble metal on TiO2 to inhibit light harvesting.In order to investigate the synergy effect between palladium nanoparticles and TiO2 during the photocatalytic CO2 hydrogenation, aluminium oxide was substituted for TiO2. The BET information of support and Pd-loaded support are summarized in Table 1. The specific surface area of TiO2 (83.45 m 2 /g) is slightly less than that of Al2O3 (97.92 m 2 /g), which can eliminate effects of specific surface area for the adsorption/concentration of CO2 molecules.There is a small decrease in specific surface area after loading palladium both for TiO2 and Al2O3, 61.82 m 2 /g for 1.0 wt Pd/TiO2 and 94.86 m 2 /g for 1.0 wt Pd/Al2O3, which can be attributed to covering effect of palladium nanoparticles on partial pores of supports.In order to investigate the dispersion of palladium nanoparticles on TiO2 and Al2O3, TEM images of 1.0 wt Pd/TiO2 and 1.0 wt Pd/Al2O3 are illustrated in Fig. S1.There is no much difference about the dispersion of palladium nanoparticles between 1.0 wt Pd/TiO2 and 1.0 wt Pd/Al2O3, ruling out that the enhanced photocatalytic process is not caused by better dispersion of palladium nanoparticles on TiO2.Aluminium oxide, a photocatalytic inert material, almost did not show any photocatalytic activity in our study, as shown in Fig. 10a. 25However, the yield of CH4 over 1.0 wt Pd/Al2O3 after irradiation for 3 h can reach 252.79 mol/g, which is about 13.72 times higher than that of pure Al2O3.This result can almost be seen as the performance of metal palladium independently.Pure TiO2 has a certain photocatalytic activity.It is obvious that 1.0 wt Pd/TiO2 exhibits the highest photocatalytic activity with 355.62 mol/g of CH4 after irradiation for 3 h, which is about 8.34 and 1.41 times higher than over pure TiO2 and palladium, respectively.It can be concluded from the above comparison that the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 supported Pd is beneficial from synergy effect between TiO2 and palladium instead of a simple superposition of their individual effects. The control experiment (Fig. 10b red line) was conducted in the absence of catalyst with otherwise identical conditions, which shows that a very small amount of CH4 was found, suggesting that the reaction of CO2 hydrogenation can occur without any catalysts.Photocatalytic CO2 hydrogenation over Pd-loading TiO2 is an enhanced reaction.In order to confirm CO2 as a carbon source of CH4, a blank experiment (Fig. The Journal of Physical Chemistry (Fig. 10d).Only a small amount of CH4 was found in this two processes, revealing that Pd-loading TiO2 is active in UV light, which is also evidenced by the UV-vis spectra.The structural stability of catalyst after reaction was investigated by characterizing the XRD (Fig. S2) and Raman spectrum (Fig. 6).No significant changes are found in the structure of used catalyst, meaning that the structure is highly stable. hydrogenation is a synergy between metal and support.There has been some reoprts that various metals will have different influence on the reaction of CO2 Page 20 of 34 The Journal of Physical Chemistry hydrogenation. 14,18,25Herein, six different metals (Pd, Pt, Ru, Rh, Ir, Ni) loaded on TiO2 were prepared with the same method (Fig. S3) to evaluate the photocatalytic activity for CO2 hydrogenation (Table 2).Compared with pure TiO2, in addition to the Ni-loaded TiO2, other samples prepared show different levels of activity increased. The adverse performance of Ni-loaded on TiO2 is possibly due to the decrease in specific surface area.We can see clearly that 1.0 wt Pd/TiO2 exhibits the top performance with the CH4 of 355.62 mol/g, the CO of 46.35 mol/g and the C2H6 of 39.69 mol/g after irradiation for 3 h.It may be explained by the adsorption of carbon dioxide, hydrogen evolution and plasma resonance effect of palladium nanoparticles. 25,39,50ble 2 Distribution and yield of each product from CO2 hydrogenation over different catalysts. aa Products (mol/g) c Catalyst b Metal loading (wt) refers to theoretical amount of noble metals loaded on the support. c Other hydrocarbons contain ethylene, propane and propylene and the yield of each product was calculated according to their standard curve respectively.
