X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were characterized by a RIGAKU Rint-2000 X-ray diffractometer equipped with graphite monochromatized Cu-K radiation ( 1.54178A).Scanning electron microscopy images and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy patterns were recorded with a JEOL 6700F field emission scanning electron microscopy.Transmission electron microscopy and high-resolution were performed with a JEOL 2100F field emission transmission electron microscopy operated at 200 kV.The pulsed adsorption of CO 2 was recorded with a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2930 chemisorption analyzer.Here the powder samples were pretreated at 150 C in Ar for 1 h before the pulsed adsorption of CO 2 .UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectrum was recorded with a Shimadzu UV-2500 Spectrophotometer.The measurements of surface area were carried out in a BELSORP II Surface Area Analyzer. The electrical structure was calculated by the DFT with the CASTEP program.Electronic structure of the In(OH) 3 was investigated via the plane-wave-pseudopotential approach based on the density functional theory (DFT).Geometry optimization model was performed to determine the most stable structure.Then its electronic structure was calculated using a standard Cambridge serial total energy package (CASTEP) code 3,4.The electron-core interaction was represented via ultrasoft pseudopotentials with a plane-wave basis cutoff energy of 340 eV.The electronic exchangecorrelation energy was treated within the frame-work of the local density approximation (LDA).The self-consistent field (SCF) tolerance was all 1 10 -6 eV/atom. A 300 W Xe arc lamp was used as the light source.The reaction was performed in a gas-closed system with a gas-circulated pump (see Fig. S4).The volume of the reaction system was about 360 mL.In a typical process, In(OH) 3 powder (0.2 g) loaded with Pt (0.5 wt.) by the in situ photo-deposition method 8 was uniformly dispersed in a glass reactor with an area of 8.5 cm 2 .Deionized water (2-3 mL) was injected into the reaction system as reductive agent.The reaction system was vacuum-pumped and washed with high purity CO 2 gas for several times.Then high purity CO 2 gas was introduced into the reaction system to achieve 80 KPa.During the irradiation, about 0.5 mL of gas was sampled from the reaction system at given intervals for subsequent CH 4 concentration analysis with a gas chromatograph (GC-14B, Shimadzu Corp., Japan)."}], "reactor type": [], "operation mode": []}}
