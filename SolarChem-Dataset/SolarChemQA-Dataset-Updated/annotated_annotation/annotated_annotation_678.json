The NiO/g-C3N4 heterojunction composites with different mass ratios of NiO (0, 20, 40, 60 and 80 wt) were obtained by the following process: 0.5g g-C3N4 was added in 60 ml ethanol and then ultrasonic dispersion for 30min.Subsequently, a certain amount (0, 0.389, 0.778, 1.168 and 1.557 g) of Ni(NO3)2.6H2Oand urea (1g) were dissolved in the solution and stirred vigorously for 30 min.Then the solution was treated with a hydrothermal route at 180 C for 12 h.The resulted products were washed with deionized water and dried at 80 C.Next then, the NiO/g-C3N4 composites with a dark-green color were obtained by calcining the hydrothermal products in air at 380 C for 2 h.The pure NiO was obtained by the same method but without the g-C3N4 addition. The surface characteristic of the catalysts were observed by a scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Phillips XL-30 FEG/NEW) and a transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Phillips Model CM200).The crystal phase of the catalysts was analyzed by powder X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) on a Bruker D8 diffractometer with Cu K radiation.The measurement was conducted in the 2 range of 10-80 o .The functional groups were characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrum (Nicolet iS50).X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB 250xi, USA) with Al K radiation source was used to analyze the surface chemical compositions and valance band (VB) spectra.N2 adsorption-desorption measurement was conducted at 77 K to analyze the specific surface area and pore structure (Quantachrome Autosorb-iQ-AG instrument).To analyze the optical properties, ultraviolet visible (UV-vis) diffuse reflection spectra and photoluminescence (PL) spectra were analyzed on a spectrophotometer (SHIMADZU UV-3600, Japan) and fluorescence spectrophotometer (Hitachi F-4600) with an excitation wavelength of 325 nm. Photoelectrochemical measurements were performed on an electrochemical system (CHI 660E, Shanghai Chenhua Instrument Co. Ltd.China) with a standard three-electrode system in a 0.5 M Na2SO4 electrolyte solution. The FTO glass coated with the prepared photocatalyst was used as the working electrode while Ag/AgCl and Pt electrodes were served as the reference and the counter electrode, respectively.The working electrode was obtained as follows: 10 mg prepared photocatalyst was dispersed in 1 mL ethanol and 20 uL nafion aqueous solution (5 wt), and then ultrasonically scattered for 2 h.In succession, 0.1 mL slurry was added dropwise on the FTO glass (11 cm), and the photocatalyst was attached on the FTO glass surface after the ethanol evaporated.The Mott-Schottky measurement was performed at two frequencies of 500 Hz and 1000 Hz respectively.Photocurrent and electrochemical impedance (EIS) tests were carried out using a 300 W Xenon-lamp. The activity of CO2 photocatalytic reduction was tested in a gas-closed circulation system with a 500 mL reactor (Perfect Light Company, Beijing, China).The reaction was performed with a 300 W Xenon-arc lamp as a light source.In general, the solution contained 50 mg photocatalyst and 100 mL deionized water were stirred continuously, and then the suspension was vacuum-treated and filled with 100 kPa CO2 (99.999) for 30 min to reach the adsorption-desorption equilibrium before illumination.The experiment was started when the light was on. The reactor temperature were maintained at 25 C via a cooling sink.During the reaction, the products were quantified per hour by a gas chromatograph (GC-2010 Plus, SHIMADZU, Japan)."}, {"llm generation": "NiO/g-C3N4 catalyst", "source": "Furthermore, the corresponding mapping images reveal the coexistence of C, N, O and Ni elements in the NiO/g-C3N4 catalyst.", "context": "The SEM images of pure g-C3N4, pure NiO and NiO/g-C3N4 heterojunction samples are shown in Fig. 1.It can be observed that pure g-C3N4 presents a two-dimensional (2D) lamellar structure (Fig. 1a) while the pure NiO exhibits perfect ball-flower morphology (Fig. 1b).The SEM image and corresponding elemental mapping images of 40 NiO/g-C3N4 sample are shown in Fig. 1c, it can be detected that the composite inherits the morphology of both NiO and g-C3N4, implying a ball-flower structure with curly and irregular shape featheredge.Furthermore, the corresponding mapping images reveal the coexistence of C, N, O and Ni elements in the NiO/g-C3N4 catalyst. The XRD patterns of the synthesized catalysts were recorded to identify their crystal phases.As observed in Fig. 2a,the peak at 27.5 o in the g-C3N4 is the characteristic (002) plane peak arising from the interlayer stacking of aromatic planes in the g-C3N4.The peak at 13.1 o could be assigned to the (100) plane, representing the in-plane structure packing motif of tri-s-triazine units 39.The prepared NiO presents five main peaks at 2 37. with the increase of NiO content in the composites, the peak intensity of g-C3N4 becomes weaker, whereas the diffraction peaks of NiO becomes stronger.To further research the functional groups of the photocatalysts, FT-IR analysis was performed and the spectra are illustrated in Fig. 2b.It is clearly observed three main characteristic peaks in pure g-C3N4.The broad peaks ranging from 3000 to 3600 cm -1 are associated with the stretching vibration of N-H or O-H of H2O 40.The skeletal adsorption bands of 1200-1700 cm -1 belong to the typical stretching modes of CN heterocycles 41.Besides, the peak at 812 cm -1 is ascribed to the breathing mode of tri-azine units 42.In the case of NiO, the broad adsorption bands at around 428 cm -1 and 1652 cm -1 are assigned to the Ni-O vibration adsorption and O-H stretching deformation 43, while the broad adsorption region with the maximum peak at around 3465 cm -1 should be originated from the hydroxyl groups and absorbed water 44.Furthermore, all characteristic peaks of both g-C3N4 and NiO can be observed in NiO/g-C3N4 composite samples, and the Ni-O peak intensity increases with increasing NiO amount.It is noteworthy that the peak observed at 428 cm -1 in NiO spectra shifts to 410 cm -1 in NiO/g-C3N4 composites, which suggests the hydroxyl groups and triazine rings of g-C3N4 are successfully interacted with NiO via hydrogen bonding or electrostatic interaction.The XRD and FT-IR results manifest the NiO/g-C3N4 p-n junctions were formed expectedly. A high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image is shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 3a and Fig. 3b show the microscopic morphology of pure g-C3N4 and NiO, which clearly demonstrates the flaky structure with curly edge and ball-flower morphologies with transparent and smooth edge, respectively, which is in good accordance with the SEM images depicted above.The TEM image of 40 NiO/g-C3N4 sample reveals the NiO and g-C3N4 are combinated together uniformly (Fig. 3c).Moreover, a 0.210 nm interplanar spacing is clearly observed in Fig. 3d, corresponding to the (200) crystal plane of cubic-structured NiO 45.The results suggest the p-n junction has been formed in the ball-flower like 40 NiO/g-C3N4 composite.4b) can be observed in C 1s spectra of the g-C3N4, which corresponds to C-C bond and N-CN group, respectively 46.Fig. 4c shows the N1s spectra for both g-C3N4 and NiO/g-C3N4.The dominated peak at 398.6 eV belongs to sp 2 hybridized aromatic N bonded to carbon (CN-C) 47, while the peak at 399.8 eV and 404.2 eV are ascribed to the tertiary nitrogen N-(C)3 groups and excitations 48 seen that all samples exhibit the type IV isotherms with a hysteresis loop (Fig. 5a), reflecting the mesoporous structure presented in the composites.The specific surface areas and pore sizes of all samples are summarized in Table .1.It is obvious that the ball-flower like heteroarchitectures could enhance the BET surface area (the maximum is 120.1 m 2 /g for 40 NiO/g-C3N4 ) greatly in contrast to that of the pure flaky g-C3N4 ( 64.7 m 2 /g ) and ball-flower NiO ( 57.6 m 2 /g ).The increase of the specific surface area may provide more active sites for reaction. The BJH pore size distributions of g-C3N4, NiO and NiO/g-C3N4 composites (Fig. 5b) reveal the narrow pore size distribution ranged from 3.6 nm to 4.1 nm. The optical properties of NiO, g-C3N4, and NiO/g-C3N4 composites were characterized by UV-vis within the range of 250-800 nm, which were converted from the corresponding diffuse reflectance spectra based on the Kubelka-Munk function.As shown in Fig. 6a, the adsorption edge of pure g-C3N4 at 440 nm is clearly observed and the ball-flower NiO shows a strong adsorption in both the UV and visible-light regions due to its dark green color.For the NiO/g-C3N4 composites, the adsorption bands attributed to the characteristic adsorption of NiO and g-C3N4 are also detected with an significant enhancement in the visible-light adsorption range (450-800 nm), which may be due to the synergistic effect between NiO and g-C3N4.Furthermore, the adsorption values of NiO/g-C3N4 samples appear stronger than that of g-C3N4 based on the vertical coordinates, which is helpful to utilize the light adsorption and facilitate the photocatalytic reaction.The band gap of g-C3N4 and NiO were also estimated according to the formula , where , h , v , A and g E represent the adsorption coefficient, Plank's constant, the light frequency, a constant relative to the material and the band gap energy, respectively.What's more, n is dependent on the type of the transition in a semiconductor.With regard to the indirect transition catalyst of g-C3N4 and direct transition catalyst of NiO, n is equal to 4 and 1, respectively.Based on the above mentioned formula, the band gap energy of pure g-C3N4 and NiO are 2.65 eV and 3.3 eV, respectively (Fig. 6b). In order to further confirm the exact band-edge positions of NiO and g-C3N4, Mott-Schottky method was employed (Fig. 7), the flat-band potentials of NiO and g-C3N4 can be determined by extrapolating to C -2 0 at the frequencies of 500 Hz and 1000 Hz.The C -2 in vertical coordinates is a function of electrochemical potentials, where the capacitance C can be obtained from the impedance measurement.The negative slope of NiO in Mott-Schottky curve indicates a p-type NiO (Fig. 7a).Similarly, the positive slope of g-C3N4 suggests the n-type semiconductor characteristics (Fig. 7b).The flat potentials of NiO and g-C3N4 are 0.85 and -0.55 V versus the Ag/AgCl electrode, respectively, which are equal to 1.05 and -0.35 V versus the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) 58,59.The inset images of Fig. 7 are the VB-XPS spectra of NiO and g-C3N4.It can be seen that the energy gap between the VB and Fermi level (Ef) is 0.30 and 2.05 eV for NiO and g-C3N4, respectively 60,61, demonstrating that the Fermi level of p-type catalyst is close to the VB while that of n-type sample is located near the CB.It is generally accepted that the value of the flat potentials is approximately equal to that of the Fermi level 62636465. Consequently, the VB potential for NiO is about 1.35 eV and the VB position for g-C3N4 is equal to 1.70 eV. Furthermore, the CB for NiO and g-C3N4 are calculated to be -1.95 and -0.95 eV respectively based on their band gaps.The diagram of the band energy for NiO and g-C3N4 are displayed in Scheme 1.Therefore, these band alignments of p-type NiO and n-type g-C3N4 meet the requirement for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2. The photocatalytic activities of the as-prepared samples were investigated on CO2 reduction under visible-light irradiation.The main product is found to be CO while only a trace amount of CH4 was detected (Fig. S1a) during the reaction process.Moreover, O2, as the oxidation product, was also detected in the outlet gases (Fig. S1b). Control experiments were also conducted and no hydrocarbon products are detected without illumination or photocatalyst, which suggests that the CO2 photocatalytic reduction process is inevitable owing to above factors.same phenomena can be seen on g-C3N4, which may be ascribed to the small surface area and rapid recombination rate of eletron-hole pairs during the reaction.While the heterojunction formed in the NiO/g-C3N4 composites, remarkable CO production is obtained surprisingly.The activity improves as the increase of NiO content, which may due to the increase amount of heterojunctions.A maximum CO production amount of 4.17 umol h -1 g -1 is achieved on 40 NiO/ g-C3N4 catalyst during 8 h reaction, which is about 2.5 times and 7.6 times as high as pure g-C3N4 and pure NiO, respectively.However, the photocatalytic activity decreased with further increase of NiO content.It may arise from the decrease of reaction active sites with low specific surface area, and the excessive NiO may act as recombination centers for charge carriers during the photocatalytic reduction process 66.In order to further explore the fact of the above inference, the separation rate of the electron-hole pairs was tested by photoluminescence.As shown in Fig. 8b, a faintest emission peak of NiO is hardly observed, which may originate from the defects or surface oxygen vacancies on NiO 67.Compared to NiO, an intensive emission peak centered at 450 nm is observed in the spectrum of g-C3N4, implying the faster recombination of electrons and holes. Compared to g-C3N4, the NiO/g-C3N4 composites exhibit a weaker emission peak in PL spectrum, suggesting the efficient separation of electron-hole pairs due to the formation of NiO/g-C3N4 heterojunctions.Noticeably, the 40 NiO/g-C3N4 composite possesses the lowest PL intensity among all the NiO/g-C3N4 composites.The PL results confirm the p-n junction effect in NiO/g-C3N4 heterostructure, which leads to an effective separation of photo-induced charges.Furthermore, in the hope of investigating the photocatalytic stability of the 40 NiO/g-C3N4 photocatalyst, three consecutive CO2 photoreduction cycles were conducted by vacuum treatment every 5 h for 30 min to remove the products.As shown in Fig. 8c, no significant decrease for CO production was observed during the three experimental runs.This indicates a stable performance of 40 NiO/g-C3N4 during the photocatalytic reaction. The excitation and transfer of charge carriers in NiO, g-C3N4 and NiO/g-C3N4 heterojunction composites were NiO exhibits rapidly increased photocurrent as the light on while the photocurrent intensity decreases with an evident delay as the light off.This is owing to the gradual release of electrons from the doping channels 68.The pristine g-C3N4 presents a quickly increased current once the light is on and a sharply decline once the light is off. It may derive from the electron trapping and releasing mediated by surface defects 69.The photocurrent curve feature for NiO/g-C3N4 heterojunctions indicates a long balance process when light is turned on or turned off, implying charge carriers experience a long distance during their migration in the heterojunction.As expected, 40 NiO/g-C3N4 heterostructured composite with the photocurrent density at 4.1 uA.cm -2 , exhibits the highest photocurrent intensity among the test materials, indicating the charge transfer with high-efficiency.To verify this assumption, EIS experiment was also carried out.As shown in Fig. 9b, the semicircular Nynquist plots for the tested samples were obtained.Compared with NiO and g-C3N4, the smallest semicircle diameter was observed in 40 NiO/g-C3N4 composite, suggesting the accelerated electron transfer in this heterostructured composite, which is in good accordance with its photocatalytic activity as shown before 70. Based on the abovementioned analysis, the possible reaction mechanism on p-n heterojunctions with excellent photocatalytic performance is discussed in Scheme 1.When p-type NiO and n-type g-C3N4 are connected closely, the electrons in n-type g-C3N4 transfer to p-type NiO, leading to a positive charge, meanwhile the holes in NiO transfer to g-C3N4, generating a negative charge.Consequently, the space charge region called internal electric field is established when the electron and hole accumulate to an equilibrium.Under light irradiation, the electrons in NiO flow into the positive region and the holes move into negative region in the effect of internal electric field.Thus, the holes on the VB of NiO are trapped by H2O to generate protons and O2.Meanwhile, the electrons on the CB of g-C3N4 react with CO2 to produce CO selectively.Obviously, the photogenerated electron-hole pairs will be effectively separated by the formed junction, resulting in a significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity. Furthermore, it has been recognized that the p-type NiO with the existed Ni 3 on its surface could increase the absorption of visible light and reduce the electric resistance of NiO, which benefits the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 28,50.In addition, the photocatalysts are selective to produce CO while only trace of CH4 molecules were formed, which may be due to the follwing reasons: (1) active sites on g-C3N4 for CO2 reduction reaction might be covered by the formed CO and/or intermediate products (C), resulting in the insufficient electrons contacted with CO2 molecules to product CH4 717273; (2) the generated hydrogen consume lots of electrons (Table.S1), which is competitive to product CH4.Moreover, the ball-flower structure with larger specific surface area that can provide massive active sites is also one of the main reasons for the superior photocatalytic activity."}, {"llm generation": "NiO", "source": "The prepared NiO presents five main peaks at 2 37. with the increase of NiO content in the composites, the peak intensity of g-C3N4 becomes weaker, whereas the diffraction peaks of NiO becomes stronger.", "context": "The SEM images of pure g-C3N4, pure NiO and NiO/g-C3N4 heterojunction samples are shown in Fig. 1.It can be observed that pure g-C3N4 presents a two-dimensional (2D) lamellar structure (Fig. 1a) while the pure NiO exhibits perfect ball-flower morphology (Fig. 1b).The SEM image and corresponding elemental mapping images of 40 NiO/g-C3N4 sample are shown in Fig. 1c, it can be detected that the composite inherits the morphology of both NiO and g-C3N4, implying a ball-flower structure with curly and irregular shape featheredge.Furthermore, the corresponding mapping images reveal the coexistence of C, N, O and Ni elements in the NiO/g-C3N4 catalyst.

Based on the abovementioned analysis, the possible reaction mechanism on p-n heterojunctions with excellent photocatalytic performance is discussed in Scheme 1.When p-type NiO and n-type g-C3N4 are connected closely, the electrons in n-type g-C3N4 transfer to p-type NiO, leading to a positive charge, meanwhile the holes in NiO transfer to g-C3N4, generating a negative charge.Consequently, the space charge region called internal electric field is established when the electron and hole accumulate to an equilibrium.Under light irradiation, the electrons in NiO flow into the positive region and the holes move into negative region in the effect of internal electric field.Thus, the holes on the VB of NiO are trapped by H2O to generate protons and O2.Meanwhile, the electrons on the CB of g-C3N4 react with CO2 to produce CO selectively.Obviously, the photogenerated electron-hole pairs will be effectively separated by the formed junction, resulting in a significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity. Furthermore, it has been recognized that the p-type NiO with the existed Ni 3 on its surface could increase the absorption of visible light and reduce the electric resistance of NiO, which benefits the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 28,50.In addition, the photocatalysts are selective to produce CO while only trace of CH4 molecules were formed, which may be due to the follwing reasons: (1) active sites on g-C3N4 for CO2 reduction reaction might be covered by the formed CO and/or intermediate products (C), resulting in the insufficient electrons contacted with CO2 molecules to product CH4 717273; (2) the generated hydrogen consume lots of electrons (Table.S1), which is competitive to product CH4.Moreover, the ball-flower structure with larger specific surface area that can provide massive active sites is also one of the main reasons for the superior photocatalytic activity."}, {"llm generation": "40 NiO/g-C3N4 sample", "source": "The TEM image of 40 NiO/g-C3N4 sample reveals the NiO and g-C3N4 are combinated together uniformly (Fig. 3c).", "context": "The SEM images of pure g-C3N4, pure NiO and NiO/g-C3N4 heterojunction samples are shown in Fig. 1.It can be observed that pure g-C3N4 presents a two-dimensional (2D) lamellar structure (Fig. 1a) while the pure NiO exhibits perfect ball-flower morphology (Fig. 1b).The SEM image and corresponding elemental mapping images of 40 NiO/g-C3N4 sample are shown in Fig. 1c, it can be detected that the composite inherits the morphology of both NiO and g-C3N4, implying a ball-flower structure with curly and irregular shape featheredge.Furthermore, the corresponding mapping images reveal the coexistence of C, N, O and Ni elements in the NiO/g-C3N4 catalyst. The XRD patterns of the synthesized catalysts were recorded to identify their crystal phases.As observed in Fig. 2a,the peak at 27.5 o in the g-C3N4 is the characteristic (002) plane peak arising from the interlayer stacking of aromatic planes in the g-C3N4.The peak at 13.1 o could be assigned to the (100) plane, representing the in-plane structure packing motif of tri-s-triazine units 39.The prepared NiO presents five main peaks at 2 37. with the increase of NiO content in the composites, the peak intensity of g-C3N4 becomes weaker, whereas the diffraction peaks of NiO becomes stronger.To further research the functional groups of the photocatalysts, FT-IR analysis was performed and the spectra are illustrated in Fig. 2b.It is clearly observed three main characteristic peaks in pure g-C3N4.The broad peaks ranging from 3000 to 3600 cm -1 are associated with the stretching vibration of N-H or O-H of H2O 40.The skeletal adsorption bands of 1200-1700 cm -1 belong to the typical stretching modes of CN heterocycles 41.Besides, the peak at 812 cm -1 is ascribed to the breathing mode of tri-azine units 42.In the case of NiO, the broad adsorption bands at around 428 cm -1 and 1652 cm -1 are assigned to the Ni-O vibration adsorption and O-H stretching deformation 43, while the broad adsorption region with the maximum peak at around 3465 cm -1 should be originated from the hydroxyl groups and absorbed water 44.Furthermore, all characteristic peaks of both g-C3N4 and NiO can be observed in NiO/g-C3N4 composite samples, and the Ni-O peak intensity increases with increasing NiO amount.It is noteworthy that the peak observed at 428 cm -1 in NiO spectra shifts to 410 cm -1 in NiO/g-C3N4 composites, which suggests the hydroxyl groups and triazine rings of g-C3N4 are successfully interacted with NiO via hydrogen bonding or electrostatic interaction.The XRD and FT-IR results manifest the NiO/g-C3N4 p-n junctions were formed expectedly. A high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image is shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 3a and Fig. 3b show the microscopic morphology of pure g-C3N4 and NiO, which clearly demonstrates the flaky structure with curly edge and ball-flower morphologies with transparent and smooth edge, respectively, which is in good accordance with the SEM images depicted above.The TEM image of 40 NiO/g-C3N4 sample reveals the NiO and g-C3N4 are combinated together uniformly (Fig. 3c).Moreover, a 0.210 nm interplanar spacing is clearly observed in Fig. 3d, corresponding to the (200) crystal plane of cubic-structured NiO 45.The results suggest the p-n junction has been formed in the ball-flower like 40 NiO/g-C3N4 composite.4b) can be observed in C 1s spectra of the g-C3N4, which corresponds to C-C bond and N-CN group, respectively 46.Fig. 4c shows the N1s spectra for both g-C3N4 and NiO/g-C3N4.The dominated peak at 398.6 eV belongs to sp 2 hybridized aromatic N bonded to carbon (CN-C) 47, while the peak at 399.8 eV and 404.2 eV are ascribed to the tertiary nitrogen N-(C)3 groups and excitations 48 seen that all samples exhibit the type IV isotherms with a hysteresis loop (Fig. 5a), reflecting the mesoporous structure presented in the composites.The specific surface areas and pore sizes of all samples are summarized in Table .1.It is obvious that the ball-flower like heteroarchitectures could enhance the BET surface area (the maximum is 120.1 m 2 /g for 40 NiO/g-C3N4 ) greatly in contrast to that of the pure flaky g-C3N4 ( 64.7 m 2 /g ) and ball-flower NiO ( 57.6 m 2 /g ).The increase of the specific surface area may provide more active sites for reaction. The BJH pore size distributions of g-C3N4, NiO and NiO/g-C3N4 composites (Fig. 5b) reveal the narrow pore size distribution ranged from 3.6 nm to 4.1 nm. The optical properties of NiO, g-C3N4, and NiO/g-C3N4 composites were characterized by UV-vis within the range of 250-800 nm, which were converted from the corresponding diffuse reflectance spectra based on the Kubelka-Munk function.As shown in Fig. 6a, the adsorption edge of pure g-C3N4 at 440 nm is clearly observed and the ball-flower NiO shows a strong adsorption in both the UV and visible-light regions due to its dark green color.For the NiO/g-C3N4 composites, the adsorption bands attributed to the characteristic adsorption of NiO and g-C3N4 are also detected with an significant enhancement in the visible-light adsorption range (450-800 nm), which may be due to the synergistic effect between NiO and g-C3N4.Furthermore, the adsorption values of NiO/g-C3N4 samples appear stronger than that of g-C3N4 based on the vertical coordinates, which is helpful to utilize the light adsorption and facilitate the photocatalytic reaction.The band gap of g-C3N4 and NiO were also estimated according to the formula , where , h , v , A and g E represent the adsorption coefficient, Plank's constant, the light frequency, a constant relative to the material and the band gap energy, respectively.What's more, n is dependent on the type of the transition in a semiconductor.With regard to the indirect transition catalyst of g-C3N4 and direct transition catalyst of NiO, n is equal to 4 and 1, respectively.Based on the above mentioned formula, the band gap energy of pure g-C3N4 and NiO are 2.65 eV and 3.3 eV, respectively (Fig. 6b). In order to further confirm the exact band-edge positions of NiO and g-C3N4, Mott-Schottky method was employed (Fig. 7), the flat-band potentials of NiO and g-C3N4 can be determined by extrapolating to C -2 0 at the frequencies of 500 Hz and 1000 Hz.The C -2 in vertical coordinates is a function of electrochemical potentials, where the capacitance C can be obtained from the impedance measurement.The negative slope of NiO in Mott-Schottky curve indicates a p-type NiO (Fig. 7a).Similarly, the positive slope of g-C3N4 suggests the n-type semiconductor characteristics (Fig. 7b).The flat potentials of NiO and g-C3N4 are 0.85 and -0.55 V versus the Ag/AgCl electrode, respectively, which are equal to 1.05 and -0.35 V versus the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) 58,59.The inset images of Fig. 7 are the VB-XPS spectra of NiO and g-C3N4.It can be seen that the energy gap between the VB and Fermi level (Ef) is 0.30 and 2.05 eV for NiO and g-C3N4, respectively 60,61, demonstrating that the Fermi level of p-type catalyst is close to the VB while that of n-type sample is located near the CB.It is generally accepted that the value of the flat potentials is approximately equal to that of the Fermi level 62636465. Consequently, the VB potential for NiO is about 1.35 eV and the VB position for g-C3N4 is equal to 1.70 eV. Furthermore, the CB for NiO and g-C3N4 are calculated to be -1.95 and -0.95 eV respectively based on their band gaps.The diagram of the band energy for NiO and g-C3N4 are displayed in Scheme 1.Therefore, these band alignments of p-type NiO and n-type g-C3N4 meet the requirement for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2. The photocatalytic activities of the as-prepared samples were investigated on CO2 reduction under visible-light irradiation.The main product is found to be CO while only a trace amount of CH4 was detected (Fig. S1a) during the reaction process.Moreover, O2, as the oxidation product, was also detected in the outlet gases (Fig. S1b). Control experiments were also conducted and no hydrocarbon products are detected without illumination or photocatalyst, which suggests that the CO2 photocatalytic reduction process is inevitable owing to above factors.same phenomena can be seen on g-C3N4, which may be ascribed to the small surface area and rapid recombination rate of eletron-hole pairs during the reaction.While the heterojunction formed in the NiO/g-C3N4 composites, remarkable CO production is obtained surprisingly.The activity improves as the increase of NiO content, which may due to the increase amount of heterojunctions.A maximum CO production amount of 4.17 umol h -1 g -1 is achieved on 40 NiO/ g-C3N4 catalyst during 8 h reaction, which is about 2.5 times and 7.6 times as high as pure g-C3N4 and pure NiO, respectively.However, the photocatalytic activity decreased with further increase of NiO content.It may arise from the decrease of reaction active sites with low specific surface area, and the excessive NiO may act as recombination centers for charge carriers during the photocatalytic reduction process 66.In order to further explore the fact of the above inference, the separation rate of the electron-hole pairs was tested by photoluminescence.As shown in Fig. 8b, a faintest emission peak of NiO is hardly observed, which may originate from the defects or surface oxygen vacancies on NiO 67.Compared to NiO, an intensive emission peak centered at 450 nm is observed in the spectrum of g-C3N4, implying the faster recombination of electrons and holes. Compared to g-C3N4, the NiO/g-C3N4 composites exhibit a weaker emission peak in PL spectrum, suggesting the efficient separation of electron-hole pairs due to the formation of NiO/g-C3N4 heterojunctions.Noticeably, the 40 NiO/g-C3N4 composite possesses the lowest PL intensity among all the NiO/g-C3N4 composites.The PL results confirm the p-n junction effect in NiO/g-C3N4 heterostructure, which leads to an effective separation of photo-induced charges.Furthermore, in the hope of investigating the photocatalytic stability of the 40 NiO/g-C3N4 photocatalyst, three consecutive CO2 photoreduction cycles were conducted by vacuum treatment every 5 h for 30 min to remove the products.As shown in Fig. 8c, no significant decrease for CO production was observed during the three experimental runs.This indicates a stable performance of 40 NiO/g-C3N4 during the photocatalytic reaction. The excitation and transfer of charge carriers in NiO, g-C3N4 and NiO/g-C3N4 heterojunction composites were NiO exhibits rapidly increased photocurrent as the light on while the photocurrent intensity decreases with an evident delay as the light off.This is owing to the gradual release of electrons from the doping channels 68.The pristine g-C3N4 presents a quickly increased current once the light is on and a sharply decline once the light is off.

Based on the abovementioned analysis, the possible reaction mechanism on p-n heterojunctions with excellent photocatalytic performance is discussed in Scheme 1.When p-type NiO and n-type g-C3N4 are connected closely, the electrons in n-type g-C3N4 transfer to p-type NiO, leading to a positive charge, meanwhile the holes in NiO transfer to g-C3N4, generating a negative charge.Consequently, the space charge region called internal electric field is established when the electron and hole accumulate to an equilibrium.Under light irradiation, the electrons in NiO flow into the positive region and the holes move into negative region in the effect of internal electric field.Thus, the holes on the VB of NiO are trapped by H2O to generate protons and O2.Meanwhile, the electrons on the CB of g-C3N4 react with CO2 to produce CO selectively.Obviously, the photogenerated electron-hole pairs will be effectively separated by the formed junction, resulting in a significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity. Furthermore, it has been recognized that the p-type NiO with the existed Ni 3 on its surface could increase the absorption of visible light and reduce the electric resistance of NiO, which benefits the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 28,50.In addition, the photocatalysts are selective to produce CO while only trace of CH4 molecules were formed, which may be due to the follwing reasons: (1) active sites on g-C3N4 for CO2 reduction reaction might be covered by the formed CO and/or intermediate products (C), resulting in the insufficient electrons contacted with CO2 molecules to product CH4 717273; (2) the generated hydrogen consume lots of electrons (Table.S1), which is competitive to product CH4.Moreover, the ball-flower structure with larger specific surface area that can provide massive active sites is also one of the main reasons for the superior photocatalytic activity."}, {"llm generation": "40 NiO/g-C3N4 photocatalyst", "source": "Furthermore, in the hope of investigating the photocatalytic stability of the 40 NiO/g-C3N4 photocatalyst, three consecutive CO2 photoreduction cycles were conducted by vacuum treatment every 5 h for 30 min to remove the products.", "context": "The SEM images of pure g-C3N4, pure NiO and NiO/g-C3N4 heterojunction samples are shown in Fig. 1.It can be observed that pure g-C3N4 presents a two-dimensional (2D) lamellar structure (Fig. 1a) while the pure NiO exhibits perfect ball-flower morphology (Fig. 1b).The SEM image and corresponding elemental mapping images of 40 NiO/g-C3N4 sample are shown in Fig. 1c, it can be detected that the composite inherits the morphology of both NiO and g-C3N4, implying a ball-flower structure with curly and irregular shape featheredge.Furthermore, the corresponding mapping images reveal the coexistence of C, N, O and Ni elements in the NiO/g-C3N4 catalyst. The XRD patterns of the synthesized catalysts were recorded to identify their crystal phases.As observed in Fig. 2a,the peak at 27.5 o in the g-C3N4 is the characteristic (002) plane peak arising from the interlayer stacking of aromatic planes in the g-C3N4.The peak at 13.1 o could be assigned to the (100) plane, representing the in-plane structure packing motif of tri-s-triazine units 39.The prepared NiO presents five main peaks at 2 37. with the increase of NiO content in the composites, the peak intensity of g-C3N4 becomes weaker, whereas the diffraction peaks of NiO becomes stronger.To further research the functional groups of the photocatalysts, FT-IR analysis was performed and the spectra are illustrated in Fig. 2b.It is clearly observed three main characteristic peaks in pure g-C3N4.The broad peaks ranging from 3000 to 3600 cm -1 are associated with the stretching vibration of N-H or O-H of H2O 40.The skeletal adsorption bands of 1200-1700 cm -1 belong to the typical stretching modes of CN heterocycles 41.Besides, the peak at 812 cm -1 is ascribed to the breathing mode of tri-azine units 42.In the case of NiO, the broad adsorption bands at around 428 cm -1 and 1652 cm -1 are assigned to the Ni-O vibration adsorption and O-H stretching deformation 43, while the broad adsorption region with the maximum peak at around 3465 cm -1 should be originated from the hydroxyl groups and absorbed water 44.Furthermore, all characteristic peaks of both g-C3N4 and NiO can be observed in NiO/g-C3N4 composite samples, and the Ni-O peak intensity increases with increasing NiO amount.It is noteworthy that the peak observed at 428 cm -1 in NiO spectra shifts to 410 cm -1 in NiO/g-C3N4 composites, which suggests the hydroxyl groups and triazine rings of g-C3N4 are successfully interacted with NiO via hydrogen bonding or electrostatic interaction.The XRD and FT-IR results manifest the NiO/g-C3N4 p-n junctions were formed expectedly. A high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image is shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 3a and Fig. 3b show the microscopic morphology of pure g-C3N4 and NiO, which clearly demonstrates the flaky structure with curly edge and ball-flower morphologies with transparent and smooth edge, respectively, which is in good accordance with the SEM images depicted above.The TEM image of 40 NiO/g-C3N4 sample reveals the NiO and g-C3N4 are combinated together uniformly (Fig. 3c).Moreover, a 0.210 nm interplanar spacing is clearly observed in Fig. 3d, corresponding to the (200) crystal plane of cubic-structured NiO 45.The results suggest the p-n junction has been formed in the ball-flower like 40 NiO/g-C3N4 composite.4b) can be observed in C 1s spectra of the g-C3N4, which corresponds to C-C bond and N-CN group, respectively 46.Fig. 4c shows the N1s spectra for both g-C3N4 and NiO/g-C3N4.The dominated peak at 398.6 eV belongs to sp 2 hybridized aromatic N bonded to carbon (CN-C) 47, while the peak at 399.8 eV and 404.2 eV are ascribed to the tertiary nitrogen N-(C)3 groups and excitations 48 seen that all samples exhibit the type IV isotherms with a hysteresis loop (Fig. 5a), reflecting the mesoporous structure presented in the composites.The specific surface areas and pore sizes of all samples are summarized in Table .1.It is obvious that the ball-flower like heteroarchitectures could enhance the BET surface area (the maximum is 120.1 m 2 /g for 40 NiO/g-C3N4 ) greatly in contrast to that of the pure flaky g-C3N4 ( 64.7 m 2 /g ) and ball-flower NiO ( 57.6 m 2 /g ).The increase of the specific surface area may provide more active sites for reaction. The BJH pore size distributions of g-C3N4, NiO and NiO/g-C3N4 composites (Fig. 5b) reveal the narrow pore size distribution ranged from 3.6 nm to 4.1 nm. The optical properties of NiO, g-C3N4, and NiO/g-C3N4 composites were characterized by UV-vis within the range of 250-800 nm, which were converted from the corresponding diffuse reflectance spectra based on the Kubelka-Munk function.As shown in Fig. 6a, the adsorption edge of pure g-C3N4 at 440 nm is clearly observed and the ball-flower NiO shows a strong adsorption in both the UV and visible-light regions due to its dark green color.For the NiO/g-C3N4 composites, the adsorption bands attributed to the characteristic adsorption of NiO and g-C3N4 are also detected with an significant enhancement in the visible-light adsorption range (450-800 nm), which may be due to the synergistic effect between NiO and g-C3N4.Furthermore, the adsorption values of NiO/g-C3N4 samples appear stronger than that of g-C3N4 based on the vertical coordinates, which is helpful to utilize the light adsorption and facilitate the photocatalytic reaction.The band gap of g-C3N4 and NiO were also estimated according to the formula , where , h , v , A and g E represent the adsorption coefficient, Plank's constant, the light frequency, a constant relative to the material and the band gap energy, respectively.What's more, n is dependent on the type of the transition in a semiconductor.With regard to the indirect transition catalyst of g-C3N4 and direct transition catalyst of NiO, n is equal to 4 and 1, respectively.Based on the above mentioned formula, the band gap energy of pure g-C3N4 and NiO are 2.65 eV and 3.3 eV, respectively (Fig. 6b). In order to further confirm the exact band-edge positions of NiO and g-C3N4, Mott-Schottky method was employed (Fig. 7), the flat-band potentials of NiO and g-C3N4 can be determined by extrapolating to C -2 0 at the frequencies of 500 Hz and 1000 Hz.The C -2 in vertical coordinates is a function of electrochemical potentials, where the capacitance C can be obtained from the impedance measurement.The negative slope of NiO in Mott-Schottky curve indicates a p-type NiO (Fig. 7a).Similarly, the positive slope of g-C3N4 suggests the n-type semiconductor characteristics (Fig. 7b).The flat potentials of NiO and g-C3N4 are 0.85 and -0.55 V versus the Ag/AgCl electrode, respectively, which are equal to 1.05 and -0.35 V versus the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) 58,59.The inset images of Fig. 7 are the VB-XPS spectra of NiO and g-C3N4.It can be seen that the energy gap between the VB and Fermi level (Ef) is 0.30 and 2.05 eV for NiO and g-C3N4, respectively 60,61, demonstrating that the Fermi level of p-type catalyst is close to the VB while that of n-type sample is located near the CB.It is generally accepted that the value of the flat potentials is approximately equal to that of the Fermi level 62636465. Consequently, the VB potential for NiO is about 1.35 eV and the VB position for g-C3N4 is equal to 1.70 eV. Furthermore, the CB for NiO and g-C3N4 are calculated to be -1.95 and -0.95 eV respectively based on their band gaps.The diagram of the band energy for NiO and g-C3N4 are displayed in Scheme 1.Therefore, these band alignments of p-type NiO and n-type g-C3N4 meet the requirement for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2. The photocatalytic activities of the as-prepared samples were investigated on CO2 reduction under visible-light irradiation.The main product is found to be CO while only a trace amount of CH4 was detected (Fig. S1a) during the reaction process.Moreover, O2, as the oxidation product, was also detected in the outlet gases (Fig. S1b). Control experiments were also conducted and no hydrocarbon products are detected without illumination or photocatalyst, which suggests that the CO2 photocatalytic reduction process is inevitable owing to above factors.same phenomena can be seen on g-C3N4, which may be ascribed to the small surface area and rapid recombination rate of eletron-hole pairs during the reaction.While the heterojunction formed in the NiO/g-C3N4 composites, remarkable CO production is obtained surprisingly.The activity improves as the increase of NiO content, which may due to the increase amount of heterojunctions.A maximum CO production amount of 4.17 umol h -1 g -1 is achieved on 40 NiO/ g-C3N4 catalyst during 8 h reaction, which is about 2.5 times and 7.6 times as high as pure g-C3N4 and pure NiO, respectively.However, the photocatalytic activity decreased with further increase of NiO content.It may arise from the decrease of reaction active sites with low specific surface area, and the excessive NiO may act as recombination centers for charge carriers during the photocatalytic reduction process 66.In order to further explore the fact of the above inference, the separation rate of the electron-hole pairs was tested by photoluminescence.As shown in Fig. 8b, a faintest emission peak of NiO is hardly observed, which may originate from the defects or surface oxygen vacancies on NiO 67.Compared to NiO, an intensive emission peak centered at 450 nm is observed in the spectrum of g-C3N4, implying the faster recombination of electrons and holes. Compared to g-C3N4, the NiO/g-C3N4 composites exhibit a weaker emission peak in PL spectrum, suggesting the efficient separation of electron-hole pairs due to the formation of NiO/g-C3N4 heterojunctions.Noticeably, the 40 NiO/g-C3N4 composite possesses the lowest PL intensity among all the NiO/g-C3N4 composites.The PL results confirm the p-n junction effect in NiO/g-C3N4 heterostructure, which leads to an effective separation of photo-induced charges.Furthermore, in the hope of investigating the photocatalytic stability of the 40 NiO/g-C3N4 photocatalyst, three consecutive CO2 photoreduction cycles were conducted by vacuum treatment every 5 h for 30 min to remove the products.As shown in Fig. 8c, no significant decrease for CO production was observed during the three experimental runs.This indicates a stable performance of 40 NiO/g-C3N4 during the photocatalytic reaction. The excitation and transfer of charge carriers in NiO, g-C3N4 and NiO/g-C3N4 heterojunction composites were NiO exhibits rapidly increased photocurrent as the light on while the photocurrent intensity decreases with an evident delay as the light off.This is owing to the gradual release of electrons from the doping channels 68.The pristine g-C3N4 presents a quickly increased current once the light is on and a sharply decline once the light is off. It may derive from the electron trapping and releasing mediated by surface defects 69.The photocurrent curve feature for NiO/g-C3N4 heterojunctions indicates a long balance process when light is turned on or turned off, implying charge carriers experience a long distance during their migration in the heterojunction.As expected, 40 NiO/g-C3N4 heterostructured composite with the photocurrent density at 4.1 uA.cm -2 , exhibits the highest photocurrent intensity among the test materials, indicating the charge transfer with high-efficiency.To verify this assumption, EIS experiment was also carried out.As shown in Fig. 9b, the semicircular Nynquist plots for the tested samples were obtained.Compared with NiO and g-C3N4, the smallest semicircle diameter was observed in 40 NiO/g-C3N4 composite, suggesting the accelerated electron transfer in this heterostructured composite, which is in good accordance with its photocatalytic activity as shown before 70.

Furthermore, it has been recognized that the p-type NiO with the existed Ni 3 on its surface could increase the absorption of visible light and reduce the electric resistance of NiO, which benefits the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 28,50.In addition, the photocatalysts are selective to produce CO while only trace of CH4 molecules were formed, which may be due to the follwing reasons: (1) active sites on g-C3N4 for CO2 reduction reaction might be covered by the formed CO and/or intermediate products (C), resulting in the insufficient electrons contacted with CO2 molecules to product CH4 717273; (2) the generated hydrogen consume lots of electrons (Table.S1), which is competitive to product CH4.Moreover, the ball-flower structure with larger specific surface area that can provide massive active sites is also one of the main reasons for the superior photocatalytic activity."}, {"llm generation": "UV", "source": "As shown in Fig. 6a, the adsorption edge of pure g-C3N4 at 440 nm is clearly observed and the ball-flower NiO shows a strong adsorption in both the UV and visible-light regions due to its dark green color.", "context": "The SEM images of pure g-C3N4, pure NiO and NiO/g-C3N4 heterojunction samples are shown in Fig. 1.It can be observed that pure g-C3N4 presents a two-dimensional (2D) lamellar structure (Fig. 1a) while the pure NiO exhibits perfect ball-flower morphology (Fig. 1b).The SEM image and corresponding elemental mapping images of 40 NiO/g-C3N4 sample are shown in Fig. 1c, it can be detected that the composite inherits the morphology of both NiO and g-C3N4, implying a ball-flower structure with curly and irregular shape featheredge.Furthermore, the corresponding mapping images reveal the coexistence of C, N, O and Ni elements in the NiO/g-C3N4 catalyst. The XRD patterns of the synthesized catalysts were recorded to identify their crystal phases.As observed in Fig. 2a,the peak at 27.5 o in the g-C3N4 is the characteristic (002) plane peak arising from the interlayer stacking of aromatic planes in the g-C3N4.The peak at 13.1 o could be assigned to the (100) plane, representing the in-plane structure packing motif of tri-s-triazine units 39.The prepared NiO presents five main peaks at 2 37. with the increase of NiO content in the composites, the peak intensity of g-C3N4 becomes weaker, whereas the diffraction peaks of NiO becomes stronger.To further research the functional groups of the photocatalysts, FT-IR analysis was performed and the spectra are illustrated in Fig. 2b.It is clearly observed three main characteristic peaks in pure g-C3N4.The broad peaks ranging from 3000 to 3600 cm -1 are associated with the stretching vibration of N-H or O-H of H2O 40.The skeletal adsorption bands of 1200-1700 cm -1 belong to the typical stretching modes of CN heterocycles 41.Besides, the peak at 812 cm -1 is ascribed to the breathing mode of tri-azine units 42.In the case of NiO, the broad adsorption bands at around 428 cm -1 and 1652 cm -1 are assigned to the Ni-O vibration adsorption and O-H stretching deformation 43, while the broad adsorption region with the maximum peak at around 3465 cm -1 should be originated from the hydroxyl groups and absorbed water 44.Furthermore, all characteristic peaks of both g-C3N4 and NiO can be observed in NiO/g-C3N4 composite samples, and the Ni-O peak intensity increases with increasing NiO amount.It is noteworthy that the peak observed at 428 cm -1 in NiO spectra shifts to 410 cm -1 in NiO/g-C3N4 composites, which suggests the hydroxyl groups and triazine rings of g-C3N4 are successfully interacted with NiO via hydrogen bonding or electrostatic interaction.The XRD and FT-IR results manifest the NiO/g-C3N4 p-n junctions were formed expectedly. A high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image is shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 3a and Fig. 3b show the microscopic morphology of pure g-C3N4 and NiO, which clearly demonstrates the flaky structure with curly edge and ball-flower morphologies with transparent and smooth edge, respectively, which is in good accordance with the SEM images depicted above.The TEM image of 40 NiO/g-C3N4 sample reveals the NiO and g-C3N4 are combinated together uniformly (Fig. 3c).Moreover, a 0.210 nm interplanar spacing is clearly observed in Fig. 3d, corresponding to the (200) crystal plane of cubic-structured NiO 45.The results suggest the p-n junction has been formed in the ball-flower like 40 NiO/g-C3N4 composite.4b) can be observed in C 1s spectra of the g-C3N4, which corresponds to C-C bond and N-CN group, respectively 46.Fig. 4c shows the N1s spectra for both g-C3N4 and NiO/g-C3N4.The dominated peak at 398.6 eV belongs to sp 2 hybridized aromatic N bonded to carbon (CN-C) 47, while the peak at 399.8 eV and 404.2 eV are ascribed to the tertiary nitrogen N-(C)3 groups and excitations 48 seen that all samples exhibit the type IV isotherms with a hysteresis loop (Fig. 5a), reflecting the mesoporous structure presented in the composites.The specific surface areas and pore sizes of all samples are summarized in Table .1.It is obvious that the ball-flower like heteroarchitectures could enhance the BET surface area (the maximum is 120.1 m 2 /g for 40 NiO/g-C3N4 ) greatly in contrast to that of the pure flaky g-C3N4 ( 64.7 m 2 /g ) and ball-flower NiO ( 57.6 m 2 /g ).The increase of the specific surface area may provide more active sites for reaction. The BJH pore size distributions of g-C3N4, NiO and NiO/g-C3N4 composites (Fig. 5b) reveal the narrow pore size distribution ranged from 3.6 nm to 4.1 nm. The optical properties of NiO, g-C3N4, and NiO/g-C3N4 composites were characterized by UV-vis within the range of 250-800 nm, which were converted from the corresponding diffuse reflectance spectra based on the Kubelka-Munk function.As shown in Fig. 6a, the adsorption edge of pure g-C3N4 at 440 nm is clearly observed and the ball-flower NiO shows a strong adsorption in both the UV and visible-light regions due to its dark green color.For the NiO/g-C3N4 composites, the adsorption bands attributed to the characteristic adsorption of NiO and g-C3N4 are also detected with an significant enhancement in the visible-light adsorption range (450-800 nm), which may be due to the synergistic effect between NiO and g-C3N4.Furthermore, the adsorption values of NiO/g-C3N4 samples appear stronger than that of g-C3N4 based on the vertical coordinates, which is helpful to utilize the light adsorption and facilitate the photocatalytic reaction.The band gap of g-C3N4 and NiO were also estimated according to the formula , where , h , v , A and g E represent the adsorption coefficient, Plank's constant, the light frequency, a constant relative to the material and the band gap energy, respectively.What's more, n is dependent on the type of the transition in a semiconductor.With regard to the indirect transition catalyst of g-C3N4 and direct transition catalyst of NiO, n is equal to 4 and 1, respectively.Based on the above mentioned formula, the band gap energy of pure g-C3N4 and NiO are 2.65 eV and 3.3 eV, respectively (Fig. 6b). In order to further confirm the exact band-edge positions of NiO and g-C3N4, Mott-Schottky method was employed (Fig. 7), the flat-band potentials of NiO and g-C3N4 can be determined by extrapolating to C -2 0 at the frequencies of 500 Hz and 1000 Hz.The C -2 in vertical coordinates is a function of electrochemical potentials, where the capacitance C can be obtained from the impedance measurement.The negative slope of NiO in Mott-Schottky curve indicates a p-type NiO (Fig. 7a).Similarly, the positive slope of g-C3N4 suggests the n-type semiconductor characteristics (Fig. 7b).The flat potentials of NiO and g-C3N4 are 0.85 and -0.55 V versus the Ag/AgCl electrode, respectively, which are equal to 1.05 and -0.35 V versus the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) 58,59.The inset images of Fig. 7 are the VB-XPS spectra of NiO and g-C3N4.It can be seen that the energy gap between the VB and Fermi level (Ef) is 0.30 and 2.05 eV for NiO and g-C3N4, respectively 60,61, demonstrating that the Fermi level of p-type catalyst is close to the VB while that of n-type sample is located near the CB.It is generally accepted that the value of the flat potentials is approximately equal to that of the Fermi level 62636465. Consequently, the VB potential for NiO is about 1.35 eV and the VB position for g-C3N4 is equal to 1.70 eV. Furthermore, the CB for NiO and g-C3N4 are calculated to be -1.95 and -0.95 eV respectively based on their band gaps.The diagram of the band energy for NiO and g-C3N4 are displayed in Scheme 1.Therefore, these band alignments of p-type NiO and n-type g-C3N4 meet the requirement for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2. The photocatalytic activities of the as-prepared samples were investigated on CO2 reduction under visible-light irradiation.The main product is found to be CO while only a trace amount of CH4 was detected (Fig. S1a) during the reaction process.Moreover, O2, as the oxidation product, was also detected in the outlet gases (Fig. S1b). Control experiments were also conducted and no hydrocarbon products are detected without illumination or photocatalyst, which suggests that the CO2 photocatalytic reduction process is inevitable owing to above factors.same phenomena can be seen on g-C3N4, which may be ascribed to the small surface area and rapid recombination rate of eletron-hole pairs during the reaction.While the heterojunction formed in the NiO/g-C3N4 composites, remarkable CO production is obtained surprisingly.The activity improves as the increase of NiO content, which may due to the increase amount of heterojunctions.A maximum CO production amount of 4.17 umol h -1 g -1 is achieved on 40 NiO/ g-C3N4 catalyst during 8 h reaction, which is about 2.5 times and 7.6 times as high as pure g-C3N4 and pure NiO, respectively.However, the photocatalytic activity decreased with further increase of NiO content.It may arise from the decrease of reaction active sites with low specific surface area, and the excessive NiO may act as recombination centers for charge carriers during the photocatalytic reduction process 66.In order to further explore the fact of the above inference, the separation rate of the electron-hole pairs was tested by photoluminescence.As shown in Fig. 8b, a faintest emission peak of NiO is hardly observed, which may originate from the defects or surface oxygen vacancies on NiO 67.Compared to NiO, an intensive emission peak centered at 450 nm is observed in the spectrum of g-C3N4, implying the faster recombination of electrons and holes. Compared to g-C3N4, the NiO/g-C3N4 composites exhibit a weaker emission peak in PL spectrum, suggesting the efficient separation of electron-hole pairs due to the formation of NiO/g-C3N4 heterojunctions.Noticeably, the 40 NiO/g-C3N4 composite possesses the lowest PL intensity among all the NiO/g-C3N4 composites.The PL results confirm the p-n junction effect in NiO/g-C3N4 heterostructure, which leads to an effective separation of photo-induced charges.Furthermore, in the hope of investigating the photocatalytic stability of the 40 NiO/g-C3N4 photocatalyst, three consecutive CO2 photoreduction cycles were conducted by vacuum treatment every 5 h for 30 min to remove the products.As shown in Fig. 8c, no significant decrease for CO production was observed during the three experimental runs.This indicates a stable performance of 40 NiO/g-C3N4 during the photocatalytic reaction. The excitation and transfer of charge carriers in NiO, g-C3N4 and NiO/g-C3N4 heterojunction composites were NiO exhibits rapidly increased photocurrent as the light on while the photocurrent intensity decreases with an evident delay as the light off.This is owing to the gradual release of electrons from the doping channels 68.The pristine g-C3N4 presents a quickly increased current once the light is on and a sharply decline once the light is off. It may derive from the electron trapping and releasing mediated by surface defects 69.The photocurrent curve feature for NiO/g-C3N4 heterojunctions indicates a long balance process when light is turned on or turned off, implying charge carriers experience a long distance during their migration in the heterojunction.As expected, 40 NiO/g-C3N4 heterostructured composite with the photocurrent density at 4.1 uA.cm -2 , exhibits the highest photocurrent intensity among the test materials, indicating the charge transfer with high-efficiency.To verify this assumption, EIS experiment was also carried out.As shown in Fig. 9b, the semicircular Nynquist plots for the tested samples were obtained.Compared with NiO and g-C3N4, the smallest semicircle diameter was observed in 40 NiO/g-C3N4 composite, suggesting the accelerated electron transfer in this heterostructured composite, which is in good accordance with its photocatalytic activity as shown before 70.
