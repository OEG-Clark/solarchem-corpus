It was evident from the ZnTe diffraction patterns that there were no characteristic peaks for impurities, such as elemental Zn or Te, which conrms the purity of the synthesized sample.The strong and sharp ZnTe peaks also indicate that the photocatalyst is highly crystalline in nature.To obtain a viable catalyst for the photoreduction of CO 2 under visible light, the synthesized SrTiO 3 and ZnTe were combined together via a modied hydrothermal reaction approach for the synthesis of SrTiO 3 -ZnTe nanocomposites with different amounts of ZnTe (i.e., 25, 50, and 75).The XRD pattern (Fig. 2) conrms the formation of the SrTiO 3 -ZnTe nanocomposites, as all the peaks from SrTiO 3 and ZnTe are present in the composites.It is noted that the intensity of the (111) diffraction peak corresponding to ZnTe increases with the increase of the amount of ZnTe in the nanocomposites (Fig. 2b-d), leading to a decrease in the intensity of the (110) diffraction peak for SrTiO 3 . The XRD data were also used to calculate the crystallite size (D), lattice constant (a), and cell volume (V) for SrTiO 3 and ZnTe, and the values are given in Table 1.All the calculated parameters for the synthesized products were in good agreement with the reported data, as already mentioned above.For ZnTe and SrTiO 3 , the crystal domain sizes were determined, respectively, to be around 36 nm and 26 nm using the diffraction peak width of ( 111) and (110) (at half maxima) in terms of the Scherrer equation (eqn (1)). Morphological analyses for all the synthesized photocatalyst powders using SEM are presented in Fig. 3.It is evident from Fig. 3a that the SrTiO 3 particles are uniformly worm-like in shape, with a size distribution in the range of around 20-26 nm, which agrees well with the crystallite sizes obtained from XRD.For bare ZnTe, it can be clearly observed that the particles are spherical in shape, with a uniform size distribution around 30-40 nm (Fig. 3e).In the case of the nanocomposite with 25 ZnTe (Fig. 3b), the spherical ZnTe nanoparticles and worm-like SrTiO 3 are well dispersed with each other, thereby, leading to close contact.As the amount of ZnTe was increased to 50 (Fig. 3c), apart from that the majority of the ZnTe nanoparticles are still well dispersed with SrTiO 3 , some of the small ZnTe nanoparticles start to be decorated on the surface of the large SrTiO 3 worm-like structures.Upon further increasing the amount of ZnTe to 75 (Fig. 3d), the majority of the ZnTe nanoparticles appear to agglomerate on the surface. Moreover, the morphology was further analyzed using TEM and the results are shown in Fig. 4. In the high magnication TEM image for bare SrTiO 3 (Fig. 4a), it can be seen that the small worm-like nanoparticles combine together to form a large cage-like structure.For the nanocomposite with 25 ZnTe (Fig. 4b), some of the spherical ZnTe particles are diffused into the cavities of the worm-like SrTiO 3 to some extent.Upon further increasing the amount of ZnTe to 50 and 75 (Fig. 4c andd), most of the ZnTe appear to be decorated in the form of agglomerated clusters on the surface of the perovskite base material.For bare ZnTe (Fig. 4e), it can also be seen that the particles are spherical in shape, for which the size is in good agreement with the XRD and SEM results.To further probe the microstructure of the nanocomposite and the formation of the interface between the two semiconductors, HRTEM was also carried out (Fig. 4f).The results clearly reveal the formation of a close interface between ZnTe, with exposed (220) crystal plane, and SrTiO 3 , with exposed (110) crystal plane.The formation of this close interface between the two materials may facilitate the efficient transfer of electrons, thereby, hindering the recombination of the charge carriers.Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) elemental mapping also reveals that the SrTiO 3 -ZnTe nanocomposite with 25 ZnTe was formed (Fig. 5) by SrTiO 3 acting as the base material, with Sr, Ti, and O uniformly distributed all over the surface.The micrograph further indicates that the spherical ZnTe nanoparticles were well dispersed with this base perovskite SrTiO 3 .The elemental maps of Zn and Te also support the claim that some of the ZnTe diffused into the cavities of the worm-like SrTiO 3 to some extent.The results of the EDX elemental mapping for the nanocomposites with 50 and 75 ZnTe also agree well with the aforementioned discussions and conclusions (Fig. S1 in the ESI ). EDX spectroscopy was used to determine the composition and stoichiometry for all the elements in the nanocomposite (Fig. S2a ).These results reveal that all the elements in the composite are in agreement with the desired stoichiometric ratios.Moreover, the EDX compositional analyses for bare SrTiO 3 and ZnTe were recorded too, and the results are shown in Fig. S2b andc, which further indicated that all the elements in SrTiO 3 (Fig. S2b ) and ZnTe (Fig. S2c ) are in accordance with the stoichiometric ratios.This also conrmed that there were no impurities in the synthesized photocatalysts.In addition, it was noted that the excess of oxygen was observed for both samples containing SrTiO 3 , which may be due to the adsorbed oxygen on the surface from the environment while preparing the sample for the analysis. The photocatalytic properties of a catalyst are closely related to the alignment of its band energy levels, which we investigated by UV-vis diffuse reectance spectra and XPS valence band spectra in this work.Fig. 6 shows the UV-vis diffuse reectance spectra of the as-prepared SrTiO 3 and ZnTe.The Kubelka-Munk function was applied to convert the diffuse reectance measurements into the equivalent absorption coefficients. 35It is evident from Fig. 6 that SrTiO 3 exhibits a strong absorption, with an edge in the UV region at around 345 nm; whereas, ZnTe shows an absorption peak at around 555 nm.For both SrTiO 3 and ZnTe, the band gap values (E g ) were thus estimated respectively to be 3.51 eV and 2.24 eV using the Tauc plots, 36 i.e., the vertical segment of each plot was extra plotted to intersect the hn axis (x-axis) (insets of Fig. 6). In addition, the valence band maximum of the assynthesized materials was determined by the XPS valence band spectra (Fig. 7).The work function for the XPS instrument in this study was 4.62 eV.The valence band maximum for ZnTe was calculated to be 0.42 eV (inset of Fig. 7a,0.44V against a standard hydrogen electrode (SHE, given as 4.60 eV for 0 V)).In the case of SrTiO 3 , its valence band maximum was around 2.48 eV (inset of Fig. 7b,2.50V against SHE).Thus, the alignment of the energy levels is drawn as shown in Fig. 8, according to which the photogenerated electrons can transfer from the conduction band (CB) of ZnTe to the CB of SrTiO 3 .Accordingly, the recombination of the photogenerated charge carriers can be suppressed greatly, which can be conrmed by the photoluminescence (PL) results. The PL spectra of bare ZnTe and the nanocomposites with different amounts of ZnTe are shown in Fig. 9.The spectra for all the synthesized photocatalysts exhibit a very similar shape to each other, with a broad band of emission signal.It is noted that the PL intensity of the nanocomposites is much weaker than that of ZnTe, due to the suppression of the recombination, the change in which follows in the order of 100 ZnTe 75 50 25.The reason that the nanocomposite with 25 ZnTe shows the lowest PL intensity may be mainly because of the good uniform dispersion of ZnTe in SrTiO 3 , as indicated by the above SEM/TEM and the mapping results (Fig. 345).Methane (CH 4 ) is the major product in the gas phase for the photoreduction of CO 2 , for which the production results are shown in Fig. 10.In addition, sometimes trace amounts of H 2 can be observed.However, the amount of H 2 cannot be determined, as He was used as carrier gas in our system.Upon visible-light illumination (l 420 nm), the amount of CH 4 produced from the SrTiO 3 -ZnTe nanocomposites with different amounts of ZnTe i.e., 25, 50, 75, and 100 (bare ZnTe) came out to be 19.03,14.58, 9.64, and 5.15 mmol g A1 (Fig. 10), respectively.No CH 4 was observed from the bare SrTiO 3 (0 ZnTe) under light 420 nm.Here it is noted that only ZnTe is considered to be a photocatalyst, as SrTiO 3 has no response to visible light.By using the amount of fuel energy converted relative to the solar power illuminated on the samples (420 nm), the total conversion efficiency aer 8 hours was calculated to be 0.36, 0.28, 0.18, and 0.098 for the photocatalysts with different amounts of ZnTe, respectively.Thus, the combination of ZnTe with SrTiO 3 can greatly improve the visible-light activity for the photoreduction of CO 2 .In addition, the stabilities of the photocatalysts have been demonstrated by studying the nanocomposite with 25 ZnTe.A slight decrease in the CH 4 yield (5 for each run) is observed.Thus, the nanocomposite photocatalysts exhibit relatively good stability. The activity and the rate of CH 4 production for bare ZnTe were relatively high because it is active under visible-light irradiation, owing to its narrow band gap, as reported earlier; whereas, the efficiency was limited, due to recombination of the photogenerated charge carriers, as already indicated by the PL spectra (Fig. 9).In the case of the SrTiO 3 -ZnTe nanocomposite with 25 ZnTe, the production rate of CH 4 and the conversion efficiency turned out to be the highest (Fig. 10).This may be ascribed mainly to the formation of nanocomposite with the close interface and uniform dispersion between ZnTe and SrTiO 3 , due to the diffusion of ZnTe spheres into the cavities of the worm-like SrTiO 3 materials, as revealed by the above results.This can result in an efficient transfer of the photogenerated charge carriers from the CB of ZnTe to the CB of SrTiO 3 , which will, thereby, facilitate the electron-hole separation to avoid possible recombination, giving rise to an efficient production of CH 4 .Generally, this process of charge transfer from the CB of ZnTe to the CB of SrTiO 3 is believed to be faster and more efficient than the corresponding electron-hole recombination process, because of the feasible band alignment. 37he mechanism for the photoreduction of CO 2 can be elucidated according to Fig. 8. First, the charge carriers (i.e., the electron-hole pairs) were generated by the photoexcitation of the catalyst. 38For efficient electron transfer, the CB of ZnTe (ca.A1.80 V vs. SHE) must be more negative than the CB of SrTiO 3 (ca.A1.01 V vs. SHE).The photocatalytic reaction for the reduction of CO 2 is initiated by the absorption of visible-light photons with an energy equal or larger than the band gap energy of ZnTe (2.24 eV), resulting in the formation of charge carriers, i.e., photogenerated holes in the valence band of ZnTe semiconductor and electrons in its CB.The photogenerated electrons can then be transferred to the CB of SrTiO 3 and can move freely via the conducting network of the SrTiO 3 , which can act as the electron reservoir.Hence, the charge separation is facilitated and the recombination of these photogenerated charge carriers is eventually hindered, leading to an improved photocatalytic activity of the nanocomposite. The photogenerated holes in the valence band of ZnTe can adsorb the water molecules to produce hydroxyl radicals (cOH), which subsequently result in the formation of H and O 2 .The interaction of H with the excited electrons gives rise to the formation of cH radicals.The photogenerated electrons in the CB of SrTiO 3 , transferred from the CB of ZnTe, can react with CO 2 to trigger the formation of very negative and metastable superoxide radicals (cCO 2 A ), 39,40 which then react with the cH radicals to form CO. The CO can be converted into cC radicals via a carbide mechanism, 41,42 followed by the formation of a series of radicals, which eventually, leads to the production of CH 4 . 42It is noted that it may also take place via the CO insertion mechanism, which involves the cleavage of the C-O bond of CO aer incorporation into the growing hydrocarbon chain, rather than the cleavage of the C-O bond of the CO before the incorporation of a CH x species into the growing hydrocarbon chain. 41hough it is possible to form other products (such as C 2 H 4 ), CH 4 is the major product, possibly because the amount of cH is much higher than other radicals."}, {"llm generation": "SrTiO3-ZnTe nanocomposites", "source": "To obtain a viable catalyst for the photoreduction of CO 2 under visible light, the synthesized SrTiO 3 and ZnTe were combined together via a modied hydrothermal reaction approach for the synthesis of SrTiO 3 -ZnTe nanocomposites with different amounts of ZnTe (i.e., 25, 50, and 75).", "context": "The crystal structure of the synthesized materials was veried by XRD (Fig. 2).In the case of SrTiO 3 , it was found to be phase pure in accordance with the available diffraction patterns (powder diffraction le (PDF) number 35-0734, a 14 3.905 A), where all the diffraction peaks conrmed the formation of a perovskitetype structure with cubic symmetry.The diffraction patterns for ZnTe, on the other hand, could be indexed for cubic ZnTe, in accordance with the reported data (PDF 15-0746, a 14 6.103 A).

SrTiO 3 nanoparticles were successfully synthesized using the sonochemical method at room temperature. 31Titanium was used in the form of titanium hydroxide suspension, denoted as TOH.First, a clear aqueous solution of 0.05 M Ti(SO 4 ) 2 was prepared by dissolving it in 50 mL of 0.1 M HNO 3 solution.This solution was then added dropwise into 0.5 M KOH solution under constant stirring, and white precipitates of titanium hydroxide were formed.For the removal of SO 4 2A and NO 3 A , these precipitates were then centrifuged and washed copiously with Milli-Q water.For the preparation of TOH, the precipitates of titanium hydroxide were dispersed in 50 mL of Milli-Q water and collected for further use.For the synthesis of SrTiO 3 , equal volumes (50 mL) of TOH and aqueous solution of 0.05 M Sr(NO 3 ) 2 were added to a beaker containing 50 mL of 0.5 M KOH solution.This mixture was then sonicated for 2.5 hours under an ambient atmosphere.The resultant white precipitates of SrTiO 3 were washed several times with Milli-Q water and nally with absolute ethanol, and then dried in an oven at 70 C under vacuum overnight.Finally, the dried SrTiO 3 nanoparticles were annealed at 650 C for 4 hours at a heating rate of 5 C min A1 , and were saved for further characterizations. ZnTe nanoparticles were successfully synthesized by the hydrothermal process. 32In a typical procedure, 0.52 g of zinc powder, 0.51 g of tellurium powder, and 4.6 g of NaOH were put into a Teon tube with 50 mL capacity.The Teon tube was then lled with Milli-Q water up to 80 of its capacity, which was then sealed in a stainless steel autoclave.The autoclave was kept in an oven for two hours at 100 C. Aer it cooled down to room temperature, the resulting brown ZnTe precipitates were then centrifuged, washed several times with Milli-Q water and nally with absolute ethanol, and were then dried in oven for overnight at 70 C under vacuum.The dried ZnTe nanoparticles were ground down and stored for further use. In a typical hydrothermal method, stoichiometric amounts of the obtained SrTiO 3 (0.15, 0.1, and 0.05 g) and ZnTe (0.05, 0.105, and 0.16 g) with a respective molar ratio of 3 : 1 (25 ZnTe), 1 : 1 (50 ZnTe), and 1 : 3 (75 ZnTe) were taken in a 50 mL Teon tube, which was then lled to 80 of its capacity with Milli-Q water.The mixture, aer being stirred for 2 hours, was then sealed in a stainless steel autoclave, which was then kept in an oven at 100 C for 10 hours.Aer the autoclave was cooled down at room temperature, the precipitates of SrTiO 3 -ZnTe nanocomposites were collected via centrifuge and washed several times with Milli-Q water and nally with absolute ethanol.The resultant precipitates were then dried at 70 C under vacuum for 8 hours, followed by thermal annealing at 200 C for two hours under ambient conditions, and nally saved for further use. A Bruker D8 focus diffractometer with Ni-ltered Cu-Ka radiation was used for the X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis to probe the crystal structure of the as-synthesized products.The XRD patterns were recorded in the 2q range of 20 to 80 at a scan rate of 0.1 min A1 .A Lambda 750 UV/visible/NIR spectrophotometer was employed to collect the UV-visible diffuse reectance spectra with wavelengths in the range of 200-800 nm at room temperature, with BaSO 4 as the reference.An HITACHI S4800 FESEM with energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrometer and HITACHI H-7700 transmission electron microscope (TEM) at 100 kV were used to analyze the morphology and composition of the as-synthesized powders.An LS55 uorescence spectrometer was used to record the photoluminescence (PL) spectra.X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed to determine the composition and valance band position of the catalysts using an ESCALAB 250Xi X-ray photoelectron spectrometer. A schematic illustration of the photocatalytic reaction system for the reduction of CO 2 is shown in Fig. 1.To produce a mixture of the CO 2 and water vapor at atmospheric pressure, a high purity CO 2 gas (99.999) was bubbled through Milli-Q water in a quartz reactor attached with the photoreaction system.It was assured before the irradiation that there was no leakage in the photoreaction system and hence the positive pressure of CO 2 inside the system was maintained at 25 kPa.Wet CO 2 was allowed to ow through the photoreaction system loaded with 20 mg of the photocatalyst with different amounts of ZnTe (i.e., 0, 25, 50, 75, and 100) for about 40 minutes before the irradiation, to ensure the complete removal of air from the system, as conrmed from the GC results, followed by the maximum adsorption of gas molecules on the photocatalysts.Aer the CO 2 -ow was stopped, a xenon lamp (300 W) equipped with a cut-off lter (420 nm) was turned on and the production of CH 4 as a function of irradiation time was measured for a total time period of 8 hours.An approximate distance of 14-15 cm was maintained between the light source and the surface of the photocatalyst suspension in the photoreactor.Tap water (15 C) was constantly recycled during the entire course of the reaction to maintain the temperature of the photoreaction system.An Agilent 7890A gas chromatograph (GC) was used to analyze the obtained CH 4 via an automated gas valve using helium (He) as the carrier gas.The GC was equipped with one thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and two (front and back) ame ionization detectors (FID).In addition, four different control experiments were conducted, i.e., a dark experiment with the photocatalysts, a blank reactor with and without irradiation, and nally with exactly the same experimental conditions but using N 2 instead of CO 2 .There was no gas product like CH 4 detected for all these control experiments, indicating that the CH 4 is produced only from the photoreduction of CO 2 over the photocatalysts under visible-light irradiation and not from any other external surrounding factors.An ILT 950 spectrodiometer (International Light Technologies) was used to measure the intensity of the incident light, so as to determine the solar energy conversion efficiency. The XRD data were used to calculate the different crystal parameters, such as crystallite size (D) via the Scherrer formula, lattice constant (a), and cell volume (V) by using eqn (1)-(3), 33 where K is the Scherrer constant (0.89), 34 l is the wavelength for the X-ray radiation (0.15418 nm for Cu-Ka), b is the full width at half maxima (FWHM) for the diffraction peak measured at 2q, and q is the diffraction angle.Diffuse reectance spectroscopy was used to determine the band gap energy (E g , eV) by using the Tauc equation (eqn (4)), where h is Plank's constant, v is the frequency of vibration, a is the absorption coefficient, E g is the band gap (eV), and K is the proportional constant."}], "reaction medium": [], "reactor type": [{"llm generation": "Slurry", "source": "An approximate distance of 14-15 cm was maintained between the light source and the surface of the photocatalyst suspension in the photoreactor.", "context": "The chemicals used in our experiments were Ti(SO 4 ) 2 (96), Sr(NO 3 ) 2 (99.5),zinc powder (99.8), tellurium powder (5 N), KOH (analytical grade, 85), and NaOH (96).All of these chemicals were purchased from Sinopharm Chemicals and were used as such without any further treatment.
