Fig. 2 depicts the FESEM images of the single AMS and its Pt-/MnO xdecorated composites.As seen from Figs. 2a and S2a, the single AMS exhibits a morphology of sea-urchin-like microspheres formed by the accumulation of ultrafine nanorods with diameters of 10 nm (Fig. 2b).After loading with Pt or MnO x , the corresponding composites still exhibit microsphere-like morphology (Figs.2c-f, S2b and S2c).For instance, the 2Pt-AMS composite still displays sea-urchin-like morphology with no obvious change in the surface of those nanorods (Fig. 2c andd), while the 4Mn-AMS composite exhibits slightly changed microsphere morphology with obvious nanoparticles loaded the surface of those nanorods (Fig. 2e andf).Although the Pt-/MnO x -co-loaded product (2Pt-4Mn-AMS) still exhibit microsphere-like structure (Fig. S2d), its morphology (Fig. 2g andh) is also obviously different from the single AMS and the 2Pt-AMS composite (Fig. 2a-d), which may be related to the increased cocatalysts loaded on the surface of those nanorods in the microsphere. From the TEM image (Fig. 3a), it can be also observed that the AMS has sea-urchin-like structure formed by accumulation of nanorods with diameters of 10 nm, and the HRTEM image and the corresponding fast Fourier transform (FFT) pattern (Fig. 3b and its inset) show that the lattice fringe spacing of nanorods is 0.35 nm, corresponding to the dspacing of (1 0 1) facets of anatase TiO 2 , suggesting that those nanorods of AMS are anatase TiO 2 .In addition, the clean surface of those nanorods suggests that the single AMS has high composition and phase purity.However, a small number of nanoparticles (as indicated by the circles in Fig. 3c) can be observed from the surface of those nanorods for the 2Pt-AMS composite.From the HRTEM image and FFT pattern (Fig. 3d and the inset in lower right corner), it can be found that the ultrafine nanoparticles attached to those nanorods have a size of 6.0 nm, and the inset (the upper right corner in Fig. 3d) illustrates that the lattice fringe spacing of ultrafine nanoparticles is 0.23 nm, corresponding to the d-spacing of (1 1 1) facets of cubic Pt 32, which is consistent with the above XRD analysis result.That is, ultrafine Pt nanoparticles (6.0 nm) are attached on the nanorods of AMS after the photodeposition process.Similarly, some ultrafine MnO x nanoparticles are also uniformly dispersed on the nanorods of 4Mn-AMS, and the particle sizes (2.0 nm) are much smaller than that of Pt nanoparticles (Fig. 3e andf).However, no obvious lattice fringe can be distinguished from those ultrafine nanoparticles (Fig. 3f). As for the 2Pt-4Mn-AMS composite, the sea-urchin-like structure of AMS still can be observed (Fig. 3g), but more nanoparticles attached on the surface of those nanorods (Fig. 3h) compared with the 2Pt-AMS and 4Mn-AMS composites.From the HRTEM image (Fig. 3i), it can be found that two kinds of nanoparticles are attached on the surface of those nanorods, one kind of nanoparticles with 6.0 nm in size is similar to the Pt nanoparticles in 2Pt-AMS (Fig. 3d), while the others with much smaller sizes are similar to the MnO x nanoparticles in 4Mn-AMS (Fig. 3f).Although both Pt and MnO x nanoparticles are too small and highly dispersed to distinguish their lattice fringes, the high-angle annular dark field (HAADF) image (Fig. 3j) and the corresponding energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) element mappings (Fig. 3k-n) of 2Pt-4Mn-AMS confirm that Pt and Mn elements are evenly dispered on the surface of those nanorods.The above results indicate that the microstructutre of AMS can be remained during the two-step photodeposition procedure, while the Pt/MnO x dual cocatalysts are successfully decorated on the surface of those nanorods, which will be discussed further below. The specific surface areas (S BET ) and Barret-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) pore size distributions of those samples were determined using liquid N 2 adsorption/desorption experiments.The AMS, 2Pt-AMS, 4Mn-AMS and 2Pt-4Mn-AMS show IV-type isotherms with H3 hysteresis loops with a S BET of 91.8, 102.3, 96.7 and 112.3 m 2 g -1 (Fig. S3a), respectively.It means that the sea-urchin-like structure of AMS leads to a relatively large specific surface area, and thus enables more effective adsorption of the gaseous reactants (CO 2 /H 2 O).Compared with the single AMS, the S BET values of those cocatalyst-decorated composites are enhanced by varying degrees, indicating that the Pt/MnO x nanoparticles are well attached on those nanorods and dispersed in the stacking pores of AMS.The BJH pore size distribution plots (Fig. S3b) shows that the single AMS has a bimodal pore size distribution, while those composites has a unimodal plot with the smaller pore size distribution peak disappeared, possibly due to the filling of Pt and MnO x nanoparticles. To confirm the elemental valence states and compositions of those products, their X-ray photoelectron spectra were determined with the energy scales calibrated using the binding energy (BE) of C1s peak at 285.0 eV.The survey XPS spectra (Fig. S4) show that the single AMS and its composites have strong BE peaks of Ti and O elements in addition to weak C signal originated from the contaminous carbon.However, no obvious BE peaks of Pt and Mn can be observed from the survey spectra of those composites.From the Ti2p high-resolution XPS spectra (Fig. 4a), it can be found that the single AMS and its composites display very similar BE peaks at 458.3/464.0eV with a splitting energy of 5.7 eV, very close to the reported values 41,42, indicating that the loading of Pt and/or MnO x cocatalyst cannot obviously change the valence state of Ti(IV) in anatase TiO 2 of AMS.The single AMS delivers an O1s highresolution XPS spectrum with two BE peaks at 529.5 and 530.9 eV (Fig. 4b), corresponding to the lattice oxygen and surface -OH oxygen atoms of anatase TiO 2 43,44, respectively.Although the 2Pt-AMS, 4Mn-AMS and 2Pt-4Mn-AMS display a lattice oxygen's BE peak at 529.5 eV, very similar to the single AMS, their surface -OH peaks slightly shifted toward higher BE directions (Fig. 4b), indicating the changed surface chemistry of AMS due to the cocatalyst decoration. The Pt4f high-resolution XPS spectra of the 2Pt-AMS and 2Pt-4Mn-AMS composites (Fig. 4c) show a set of BE peaks with a splitting energy of 3.4 eV.Among them, the BE peaks of 2Pt-AMS at 70.2 and 73.6 eV can be classified as Pt4f 7/2 and Pt4f 5/2 of metallic Pt, suggesting that the photodeposition method can completely reduce the Pt(IV) species to metallic Pt 33,34.Compared with 2Pt-AMS, 2Pt-4Mn-AMS displays slight shift in the BE peaks, indicating that the additional MnO x nanoparticles lead to an enhanced interaction of Pt and TiO 2 35.Both 4Mnt-AMS and 2Pt-4Mnt-AMS show very weak BE peak of Mn2p 3/2 at 641 eV, which is located between Mn(II) and Mn(III) species (Fig. 4d), implying that the Mn in those composites might coexist in the mixed valence state of 2/3 42.Also, the weak Mn2p signals further demonstrate the very low actual loading amount as shown in Table S1, possibly due to the difficult photooxidation of Mn 2 species in the absence of electron capturing agent.Therefore, 2Pt-10Mn-AMS composite with higher Mnloading content was applied to confirm the coexistence of Mn 2 /Mn 3 species in those MnO x -decorated samples.As shown in Fig. 4d, the Mn2p high resolution XPS spectrum of 2Pt-10Mn-AMS can be mainly deconvoluted into two groups of BE peaks at 640.8/652.6 and 642.5/654.2eV, which are ascribable to the Mn 2 2p 3/2 /Mn 2 2p 3/2 and Mn 3 2p 1/2 / Mn 3 2p 1/2 42,45, respectively.This result reveals that the mixed valence states of Mn(II)/Mn(III) exist in those MnO x -decorated composites. Control experiments demonstrated that no reduced product can be produced in the photoreaction system without photocatalyst, light irradiation and/or CO 2 gas.It suggests that the CH 4 /CO products are generated from the photoreaction of CO 2 /H 2 O over the photocatalyst.Also, isotopic labeling experiments were conducted under an atmosphere of 13 CO 2 with the 2Pt-Mn-AMS composite as photocatalyst, and an Aligent 6890 N/5975 gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC-MS) was used to analyze the gaseous product.As seen from Fig. S5, the diagnostic peaks of 13 CO (at m/z 29) and 13 CH 4 (at m/z 17) can be observed when 13 CO 2 gas is used as carbon source, while no such peaks can be observed when 12 CO 2 was used, revealing that the CO/CH 4 reduced products are derived from the CO 2 photoreduction process rather than the decomposition of other substances in the photocatalytic system.After that, the photocatalytic CO 2 RR performance of the AMS and its composites are determined.As shown in Fig. 5a, the single AMS exhibits CO/CH 4 yields of 2.01/9.31mol g -1 h -1 , corresponding to a total photoactivity (TCEN) of 78.5 mol g -1 h -1 as calculated with Eq. (1).This CO 2 RR performance can be greatly improved by decorating Pt nanoparticles, and the 2Pt-AMS composite delivers the highest CO/CH 4 yields of 51.6/52.9mol g -1 h -1 with a TCEN of 526.4 mol g -1 h -1 , 5.7 times higher than that of AMS alone.Although the CO 2 RR activities of yMn-AMS composites are much lower than those of xPt-AMS composites, they are still better than that of the single AMS (Fig. 5b).Among those yMn-AMS composites, 4Mn-AMS delivers the best CO/CH 4 yields of 2.69/28.8mol g -1 h -1 , corresponding to a TCEN of 235.8 mol g -1 h -1 , only increased by 2.0 times compared to the single AMS. Since Pt nanoparticles are commonly used as the most efficient cocatalyst for H 2 evolution reaction (HER), a GC-2010 gas chromatograph with a BID detector was used to check whether HER occurs in the current CO 2 RR system, and the corresponding results and those reduced products (CO/CH 4 ) of CO 2 RR and H 2 of H 2 O reduction reaction as well as their product selectivity (defined as the percentage of the yield of a specific reduced product relative to the total yield of all reduced products) are listed in Table S2.As seen, no obvious H 2 is evolved from the photoreaction systems containing the single AMS and the 4Mn-AMS composite, while those Pt-decorated products (2Pt-AMS and 2Pt-4Mn-AMS) deliver a small amount of H 2 with less than 10 H 2 selectivity.The above results indicate that the photoactivity of AMS can be improved by both Pt and MnO x nanoparticles, but the promotion effect of Pt is much more obvious than that of MnO x .Nevertheless, the MnO x loading causes a greatly improved selectivity of CH 4 product (Table S2).For example, the 2Pt-AMS displays an obviously decreased CH 4 selectivity (42.3) compared to that (82.3) of the single AMS, while the 4Mn-AMS delivers much higher CH 4 selectivity (91.4).It suggests that MnO x nanoparticles on AMS can promote the generation of CH 4 during the photocatalytic CO 2 RR process. Compared with the single AMS and its single cocatalyst-decorated composites, the Pt/MnO x dual cocatalysts decorated ones deliver more significant improvement in the photocatalytic CO 2 RR activity (Fig. 5c).Among them, 2Pt-4Mn-AMS shows the best CO 2 RR performance with CO/CH 4 yields of 16.5/125.3mol g -1 h -1 , the corresponding total activity (TCEN) is up to 1035.4 mol g -1 h -1 , which is 13, 2.0 and 3.3 times higher than those of the single AMS, 2Pt-AMS and 4Mn-AMS, respectively.Moreover, the 82.4 of CH 4 selectivity of the 2Pt-4Mn-AMS is much higher than that (42.3) of the 2Pt-AMS.These results indicate that there is a synergistic effect between the Pt/MnO x dual cocatalysts on AMS, which greatly improve the photoactivity and CH 4 selectivity.Based on the CO/CH 4 yields of 2Pt-4Mn-AMS, an apparent quantum yield (AQY), which is defined as the molar percentage of the number of electrons consumed by the reduced products relative to the number of incident photons, can be calculated to be 2.11 (Please refer to the Supplementary Data and Fig. S6 for details).As can be seen from Table S3, the CO/CH 4 yields (16.5/125.3mol g -1 h -1 ) and AQY (2.11) of 2Pt-4Mn-AMS are better than that of most TiO 2 -based photoocatalysts reported recently.Furthermore, when a commercial TiO 2 (P25, Degussa) or a home-made -Al 2 O 3 nanoparticles was used to replace AMS to decorate Pt and MnO x through the same process of 2Pt-4Mn-AMS, the resultant 2Pt-4Mn-Al 2 O 3 shows no any photoactivity, and the 2Pt-4Mn-P25 just delivers CO/CH 4 yields of 55.3/33.1 mol g -1 h -1 with a total activity of 561.8 mol g -1 h -1 and a CH 4 selectivity of 33.1 (Table S2).All of them are much lower than that of the 2Pt-4Mn-AMS.These results demonstrate that photoactive material (i.e.TiO 2 in this situation) are necessary for the photocatalytic CO 2 RR process, and its microstructure has an important influence on the photoactivity. Especially, the synergistic effect of dual cocatalysts on AMS renders the significantly improved CO 2 RR performance, and thus provides a simple yet general strategy for fabricating high-performing CO 2 RR TiO 2 -based photocatalyst. The long-term test result shows that the 2Pt-4Mn-AMS has relatively good photocatalytic stability during the 10 runs of 40 h illumination of Xe-lamp full spectrum (Fig. 5d), in which each run was conducted for 4 h.In each run, the CO/CH 4 produced amounts in the first hour of illumination are much higher than those in the following consecutive three hours of illumination, and the CO/CH 4 evolution amounts gradually decrease with the extension of illumination time.Since the present system delivers obviously high CH 4 selectivity, the average CH 4 rates of the 10 runs were calculated to estimate the photostability of the 2Pt-4Mn-AMS.The result shows that an average CH 4 rate of 52.6 mol g -1 h -1 is obtained in the first run of 4 h illumination, which then decreases to 45.4, 45.0, 44.2, 43.0, 44.4,43.7, 42.8, 43.7 and 42.6 mol g -1 h -1 in the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth and tenth run, respectively.Although the average CH 4 rate of the second run is only 86.4 of that of the first one, the CH 4 rates for the later runs have not obviously decreased compared with that in the second run.Moreover, the XRD pattern of the recovered 2Pt-4Mn-AMS after the consecutive runs is very similar to that of the original one (Fig. S7a), and the survey XPS spectrum (Fig. S7b) as well as those high-resolution Ti2p, O1s, Pb4f Mn2p XPS spectra (Fig. S7c-f) of the recovered photocatalyst are also very similar to that of the original ones.The above results demonstrate that the crystal phase and element valence states of the 2Pt-4Mn-AMS composite are unchanged obviously during the long-term photocatalytic CO 2 RR process, and thus has relatively high photostability. For exploring the enhancement mechanism of CO 2 RR performance over the dual cocatalysts decorated AMS, the optical absorption properties and energy band structures were investigated initially.The UV-Vis diffuse reflectance absorption spectra (DRS, Fig. 6a) show that the single AMS has an absorption edge at 385 nm, and the yMn-AMS composites display very similar DRS spectra only with slight absorption enhancement in the range of 400 600 nm, which may be related to the low MnO x -loading content as mentioned above.However, those xPt-AMS and 2Pt-yMn-AMS composites deliver the characteristic DRS spectra of AMS with strong spectral responses in the range of 400-800 nm, which can be due to the Pt nanoparticles decorated on AMS 36.From the Tauc plot (hv) n -hv, n 2 of AMS (Fig. S8a), the bandgap energy (E g ) can be calculated to be 3.27eV, and its valence band (VB) tom (E VB ) is determined to be 2.33 eV as shown in the valence band XPS spectrum (Fig. S8b).Correspondingly, the conduction band (CB) bottom (E CB ) of AMS can be calculated to be -0.94V according to the formula (E CB E VB -E g ), and thus the energy band structure of AMS is shown in Fig. 6b. Under illumination, the electrons of AMS can be excited from VB to CB and then transferred to the Pt nanoparticles, while the remained holes in VB can transport to the MnO x that can serve as hole collector and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) sites 41,42.The measured O 2 evolution amount in the initial 3 runs during the photostability test process (Fig. 5d) demonstrates that the MnO x loaded on AMS is beneficial for the water oxidization reaction to produce O 2 from the present photoreaction system.Since the CB potential (-0.94 V) is more negative than that of CO 2 /CH 4 redox couple 39, the captured electrons of Pt nanoparticles can promote the CO 2 RR process to produce CH 4 /CO.Generally speaking, the enhanced CO 2 RR activity can be tentatively attributed to the effective photogenerated charge separation induced by the dual-cocatalysts on AMS.This conjecture can be confirmed by the photoluminescence (PL) spectra (Fig. 6c).Under the excitation light of 290 nm, the single AMS shows a strong PL intensity owing to the serious photogenerated charge recombination, while the 2Pt-AMS composite displays greatly reduced PL intensity.It implies that the photogenerated electrons of AMS can migrate to Pt nanoparticles timely, and thus effectively suppress the charge recombination.Similarly, 4Mn-AMS also exhibits a decreased fluorescence intensity but not as significant as the situation of Pt cocatalyst.This may be due to the low decoration content of MnO x on AMS (Table S1) and the migration of photogenerated holes is more difficult than that of electrons.Furthermore, the Pt/MnO x codecorated product (2Pt-4Mn-AMS) shows the weakest PL intensity, which can due to the synergistic effect of dual cocatalysts that cause the photogenerated electrons and holes of AMS to migrate effectively from the AMS to the surface cocatalysts, thus can significantly retard the charge recombination.The transient photocurrent-time (i-t) curves (Fig. 6d) also support this viewpoint, those cocatalyst-decorated composites exhibit much higher photocurrent density than the pure AMS.Once again, the 2Pt-4Mn-AMS has the highest photocurrent density, implying that the Pt/MnO x dual catalysts can not only promote the migration of photogenerated charge carrier to the photocatalyst surface, but also favor the interfacial charge transfer to the reactants during the photocatalytic CO 2 RR process, which can be supported by its best CO 2 RR activity (Fig. 5).These results demonstrate the charge recombination is effectively inhibited by the Pt/MnO x dual cocatalysts on AMS, and thus causing the significantly improved CO 2 RR performance. The effects of cocatalysts on the adsorption/activation capacity of reactants (CO 2 /H 2 O) were further investigated using temperatureprogrammed desorption-mass spectrometry (TPD-MS), in which the CO 2 (M/z 44) and H 2 O (M/z 18) desorbed from sample surface after heating were monitored using mass spectrometry, and the signal peak with temperature below 200 C represents the physical adsorption of CO 2 , while that above 200 C represents the chemisorption of CO 2 on the sample.For instance, the single AMS displays a CO 2 -TPD-MS spectrum (M/z 44) with a signal peak centered at 130 C and a very weak one at 700 C (Fig. 7a), implying that the single AMS has relatively strong physical adsorption ability of CO 2 molecules, while the CO 2 chemisorption capacity is limited.As for the 2Pt-AMS composite, however, the physical adsorption signal peak at 130 C is significantly weakened, while a strong peak appears at 340 C. It indicates that Pt-loading can significantly enhance the chemisorption ability of CO 2 molecules.Compared with 2Pt-AMS, 4Mn-AMS shows a higher CO 2 chemisorption temperature (370 C) with a weaker shoulder at 550 C, implying that 4Mn-AMS has stronger CO 2 chemisorption capacity than 2Pt-AMS.Moreover, the 2Pt-4Mn-AMS displays wider CO 2 desorption curves than the 4Mn-AMS and 2Pt-AMS, which may be due to the synergistic effect of dual cocatalysts that lead to a significant enhancement of CO 2 chemisorption capacity. From the H 2 O-TPD-MS spectra (Fig. 7b), it can be found that the H 2 O desorption peak of the single AMS is located at 300 C, while the 2Pt-AMS has an additional desorption peak at 400 C, indicating that Pt loading enhances the H 2 O chemisorption ability on AMS.In addition, the desorption peak temperatures of 4Mn-AMS and 2Pt-4Mn-AMS are higher than that of AMS and 2Pt-AMS, implying that MnO x loaded on AMS is more beneficial to the chemisorption of H 2 O molecules than Pt nanoparticles.It is worth mentioning that the effect of MnO x as cocatalyst on the AMS surface chemistry is more obvious than that of Pt nanoparticles as shown in Fig. 7a andb.Since it was reported that MnO x on semiconductors can served as hole collector and OER sites 41,42, which can be validated by the fact that O 2 evolution amount increases along with the extension of illumination time (Fig. 5d), it is reasonable to conclude that MnO x on AMS can collect the photogenerated holes to more effectively promote to reaction with the adsorbed H 2 O molecules on it for OER.This conjecture can be supported by the above results that the MnO x on AMS leads to more effective charge separation and interfacial transfer (Fig. 6c,d).In general, the above results demonstrate that Pt/MnO x dual cocatalysts are the key factor to improve the CO 2 /H 2 O adsorption capacity by varying the surface chemistry of AMS, and thus significantly enhance the CO 2 RR activity (Fig. 5). In-situ diffuse reflectance infrared absorption spectra (in-situ DRIFTS) of various samples before and after illumination were measured to further explore the activation ability of reactants.As seen from Fig. 8a, the single AMS without illumination (0 min, in dark) displays a weak IR band of adsorbed H 2 O at 1463 cm -1 , a moderate band of bidentate carbonates (b-CO 3 2-) at 1359 cm -1 with a shoulder at 1334 cm -1 , a strong band of HCOO -at 1610 cm -1 , and strong IR bands of monodentate carbonates (m-CO 3 2-) at 1554/1406 cm -1 with a weak one at 1470 cm -1 464748.Moreover, the IR bands at 1677 and 1250 cm -1 can be assigned to the CO 2 -species on AMS 8,46, suggesting that the electrons could be spontaneously attached to CO 2 from the defective TiO 2 even in dark 46.After illumination, the single AMS displays a changed in-situ DRIFTS spectrum compared with that in dark (0 min).Especially, the signals of the adsorbed H 2 O at 1643 cm -1 , HCOO -at 1610 cm -1 and m-CO After loading with Pt nanoparticles, the resultant 2Pt-AMS in dark exhibits an in situ DRIFTS spectrum (Fig. 8b) obviously different from that of the single AMS in dark (Fig. 8a), whereby those IR peak intensities for H 2 O at 1465 cm -1 , b-CO 3 2-at 1599/1357/1336 cm -1 , m-CO 3 2-at 1555/1542/1470 cm -1 , HCOO -at 1613 cm -1 and CO 2 at 1681/1258 cm -1 are much lower than those of the single AMS in dark, implying that the Pt loading results in a changed surface chemistry of AMS.Nevertheless, the signal enhancements of those IR absorption peaks (at 1645, 1613, 1470 and 1433 cm -1 ) for the 2Pt-AMS are more obvious than that of the single AMS during the illumination, indicating that more H 2 O, HCOO -and HCO 3 2-species are generated on the 2Pt-AMS during the photocatalytic CO 2 RR process, which is the reason for its better CO 2 RR performance compared with the single AMS (Fig. 5a). In addition, the 2Pt-AMS in dark (Fig. 8b) displays more obvious and stronger IR peaks at 1357 and 1336 cm -1 of b-CO 3 2-group (which is conducive to the generation of CO 13) than the single AMS in dark (Fig. 8a).Under illumination, those peak intensities show an increasing trend, which might be the reason that those Pt-decorated AMS composites deliver decreased CH 4 selectivity compared with the single AMS (Fig. 5a).Generally, the in situ DRIFTS spectrum of 4Mn-AMS in dark (Fig. 8c) is similar to that of the single AMS in dark (Fig. 8a), there exists obvious IR absorption bands at 1645, 1610 and 1431 cm -1 , which gradually enhanced along with the extension of illumination time, and thus promote the generation of CH 4 /CO (Fig. 5a).Nevertheless, the 4Mn-AMS after the illumination displays a much lower IR peak at 1470 cm -1 (belonging to m-CO 3 2-) than the single AMS after the illumination, indicating that the MnO x loading changes the surface chemistry and then the adsorption performance of AMS, which will be not conducive to CO production over the 4Mn-AMS.These changes in the adsorption/activation capacity induced by MnO x cocatalyst may be responsible for the higher CH 4 selectivity of 4Mn-AMS during the CO 2 RR process (Fig. 5b and Table S2). The dual cocatalysts decorated product (2Pt-4Mn-AMS) displays the advantages of 2Pt-AMS and 4Mn-AMS (Fig. 8d) under the illumination, and there are a new IR absorption peak at 1433 cm -1 belonging to the HCO 3 -and the more obvious IR absorption peak at 1732 cm -1 belonging to the -CHO group 49.The formation of -CHO group usually requires the acceptance of more photogenerated electrons, and therefore it can be inferred that the relationship between the IR absorption peak at 1732 cm -1 and time is related to the transition of HCOO -(at 1606 cm -1 ) adsorbed on the material surface 49,50.That is, the Pt nanoparticles co-decorated with MnO x can promote the chemisorption of H 2 O/CO 2 molecules on the photocatalyst surface (Fig. 7), and then the formation of the adsorbed HCOO -on the composite surface during the illumination, which can transfer into -CHO induced by the co-existed MnO x , and thus promotes the CH 4 generation during the CO 2 RR process 8,46,49.Therefore, the Pt/MnO x dual catalysts not only promote the photogenerated charge transfer to reactants, but also enhance the CO 2 /H 2 O adsorption/activation capacity of photocatalyst, thus causing the significantly improved CO 2 RR activity and CH 4 selectivity (Fig. 5c).On the bases of the above results and discussion, the possible enhancement mechanism of CO 2 RR performance of the Pt/MnO x dual cocatalysts decorated AMS can be concluded as follows: (1) The cocatalysts can promote the AMS's photogenerated charge separation and transfer; (2) The cocatalysts improves the surface chemistry of AMS and then enhance the adsorption/activation capacity of CO 2 /H 2 O. On one hand, the Pt nanoparticles serve as electron traps to effectively transfer the photogenerated electrons from AMS, and thus plays a main role in improving the charge separation ability and CO 2 RR efficiency.On the other hand, the MnO x sites can act as the sink of photogenerated holes 41,42, but it is less effective than Pt nanoparticles in promoting the charge separation since the migration rate of holes is lower than that of electrons.Nevertheless, MnO x nanoparticles play a major role in improving the surface chemistry of AMS, which can enhance the adsorption/activation capacity of CO 2 /H 2 O, and thus improve the CO 2 RR activity and CH 4 selectivity.In a word, through the synergistic action of Pt and MnO x dual cocatalysts in 2Pt-4Mn-AMS, the rapid separation of photogenerated charge carriers can be realized to inhibit the charge recombination, while the changed surface chemistry of AMS enhance the adsorption/activation capacity of the reactants (CO 2 /H 2 O).Both of them can improve the photocatalytic CO 2 RR activity and CH 4 product selectivity."}, {"llm generation": "anatase TiO2 microspheres (AMS)", "source": "In summary, Pt and MnO x dual cocatalysts decorated sea-urchin-like anatase TiO 2 microspheres (AMS) were synthesized for photocatalytic CO 2 RR application.", "context": "In summary, Pt and MnO x dual cocatalysts decorated sea-urchin-like anatase TiO 2 microspheres (AMS) were synthesized for photocatalytic CO 2 RR application.The effects of the dual cocatalysts on the morphology, microstructure, crystalline phase, photoabsorption, photoelectrochemical behaviors and the reactants (CO 2 /H 2 O) adsorption/ activation capacity were explored based on the characterization results of transient photocurrent, DRS, XPS, PL, TPD-MS and in-situ DRIFTS spectra, and the possible enhancement mechanism of CO 2 RR activity and CH 4 product selectivity of AMS induced by the dual cocatalysts is proposed.That is, the Pt and MnO x cocatalysts can not only promote the fast separation of photogenerated charge carriers to inhibit the charge recombination, but also effectively improve the surface chemical properties of photocatalyst to enhance the CO 2 /H 2 O adsorption/activation capacity, and thus causing the significantly enhanced photocatalytic CO 2 RR performance and CH 4 product selectivity.The synergistic effect of dual cocatalysts in the present system provides a simple yet general strategy for the design of high-efficiency CO 2 RR TiO 2 -based photocatalyst with high CH 4 selectivity.

The crystal phases of samples were analyzed on a Miniflex 600 X-ray diffractometer (XRD) operating at 40 kV and 15 mA with Cu K radiation ( 0.154 nm).The morphology and microstructures were observed with a Verios field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) and a JEOL LaB 6 JEM-2100(HR) high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM).Specific surface area (S BET ) and Barret-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) pore size distributions were measured via liquid N 2 adsorption/desorption experiment at -196 C using a Micrometrics ASAP 2460 system after the sample was degassed at 120 C for 3 h.UV-Vis diffuse reflectance absorption spectra (DRS) were determined on an Agilent Cary 5000 spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere using BaSO 4 as the reference.Element valence states and valence band spectra were detected on a Thermo Fisher ESCALAB 250Xi X-ray photoelectron spectroscope (XPS) equipped with a standard and monochromatic source (AlK, 1486.6 eV).Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded using a Hitachi F-4600 fluorimeter.A Bruker S4 Pioneer X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometer was used to determine the elemental compositions of various samples with Rh target and without standard sample. CHI Model 618C electrochemical analyzer was used to obtain the transient photocurrent curves in a three-electrode system with Pt wire, Pt plate and saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as work, counter and reference electrode, respectively.Work electrode was fabricated by depositing Nafion suspension (0.20 mL) containing sample (10 mg) on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass (1.0 1.0 cm 2 ), and drying at 70 C for 1 h to volatilize the solvent and steady the film.During the photoelectrochemical measurement, the three electrodes were immersed into an electrolyte containing Na 2 SO 4 solution (0.5 M) and methyl viologen (3.0 mg) as electron media, which was continuously purged by N 2 flow for 30 min before illumination. Temperature-programmed desorption-mass spectrometry (TPD-MS) of reactants (CO 2 /H 2 O) on sample was performed on a Micromeritics Autochem II-Cirrus 2 Chemisorption Analyzer.The sample was heated to 200 C with a heating rate of 10 C min -1 in Ar atmosphere and maintained at this temperature for 2 h to remove the adsorbate.After cooling to 80 C, a wet 10 CO 2 /Ar mixed gas replaced the Ar flow for the CO 2 /H 2 O adsorption for 90 min, and the excessive CO 2 /H 2 O molecules were purged with Ar flow for 1 h (All flow rates are set at 30 mL min -1 ).After that, TCD detector started to record the signals until the temperature raised to 900 C, and the desorbed gas during the H 2 O/CO 2 -TPD process was installed to a quadruple mass spectrometer (MKS Instrument) operating in multiple-ion-monitoring (MIM) mode to record the mass signals of CO 2 (M/z 44) and H 2 O (M/z 18).In-situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectra (DRIFTS) of reactants (CO 2 /H 2 O) on sample under light irradiation were measured on a Thermo Electron Nicolet iS50 spectrometer equipped with liquid N 2 cooled HgCdTe (MCT/A) detector with a resolution of 4 cm -1 by using 64 scans.Typically, sample (0.05 g) was dispersed on the DRIFTS accessory, then vacuum treatment at 200 C for 60 min was conducted for removing the air.After that, humid CO 2 gas (50 mL) was introduced into the reactor until 1 atm.Once the IR spectrum is stabilized, the sample was irradiated with 300 W Xe-lamp through a quartz window, and IR spectrum was collected when it was stabilized again. The photocatalytic CO 2 RR experiment was performed in a gas-closed Pyrex glass reactor (volume of 500 mL) using a 300 W Xe-lamp as light source.Typically, 0.06 g of sample was evenly dispersed on a watch glass (area of 28 cm 2 ) that was placed on a holder in the reactor, then NaHCO 3 (1.60 g) was added into the bottom of reactor.After complete removal of air by vacuum treatment, 5.0 mL of H 2 SO 4 solution (40) was introduced with a syringe to produce CO 2 /H 2 O vapor.During illumination, 2.0 mL of gas was taken out periodically (1.0 h) and detected using a SP-7820 gas chromatograph (TDX-01 column, Rainbow) equipped with a flame ionized detector (FID) and methanator, product contents are calibrated by an external standardization method using commercial standard gas mixture.In addition, H 2 , O 2 , C 2 H 4 , C 2 H 6 and CH 3 OH were checked using a GC-2010 gas chromatograph (BID detector, Shimadzu), and HCOOH, HCHO, CH 3 OH in the acetic ether extract of the solution in the bottom of reactor after the photoreaction process were detected using an Ascend 400 1 H NMR spectrophotometer (Bruker).It was found that in the present CO 2 RR system, CH 4 and CO are the main reduced products, and occasionally some photocatalysts can produce a small amount of H 2 .No other reduced product such as CH 3 OH, C 2 H 4 , C 2 H 6 (using GC-FID or GC-BID detector) or HCOOH, HCHO, CH 3 OH (using 1 H NMR spectrum) is detected. Control experiments demonstrated that no reduced product can be produced in the photoreaction system without photocatalyst, light irradiation or CO 2 gas, suggesting that the CH 4 /CO products are generated from the photoreaction of CO 2 /H 2 O over photocatalyst.Because the main reduced products need to consume different numbers of electrons, total consumed electron number (TCEN) of the produced CH 4 /CO is proposed to evaluate the total photoactivity of CO 2 RR using Eq. ( 1) 3,4,8: where V rea. is the volume of reactor; m cat. is the photocatalyst amount; t irr. is the illumination time; c CO and c CH4 are the produced concentrations of CO and CH 4 , respectively."}, {"llm generation": "Pt, MnOx", "source": "The hydrothermally synthesized sample (AMS) and its composites decorated with Pt or/and MnO x cocatalysts display very similar X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (Figs. 1 andS1).", "context": "The hydrothermally synthesized sample (AMS) and its composites decorated with Pt or/and MnO x cocatalysts display very similar X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (Figs. 1 andS1).The single AMS exhibits obvious diffraction peaks at 2 25.3 , 34.4 , 36.9 , 37.8 , 38.6 , 53.9 , 55.1 , 62.7 and 68.8 (Fig. 1a), ascribable to the reflections of (1 0 1), (1 0 3), (0 0 4), ( 1 1 2), (2 0 0), (1 0 5), (2 1 1), (2 0 4) and(1 1 6) facets of anatase TiO 2 (JCPDS No. 21-1272) 8,32, respectively.No other impurity peak is detected, suggesting that the single AMS has high phase purity and the rutile phase of P25 nanoparticles completely transformed into anatase during the preparation process 8,38,39.Along with the increase of Pt content in the Pt-AMS composites, a weak diffraction peak at 2 39.7 is gradually emerging, which can be due to the reflection of (1 1 1) facets of cubic metallic Pt (JCPDS No. 04-0802) 32.Nevertheless, on obvious diffraction peak of manganese oxides is observed from the MnO x decorated (Fig. S1) and Pt/MnO x co-decorated (Fig. 1b) composites, which may be related to the very low actual loading content or crystallinity of MnO x on AMS.This conjecture can be partly supported by the actual element compositions of the single AMS and its Pt/MnO xdecorated composites determined using an X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometer.As shown in Table S1, the Ti/O molar ratio of the single AMS and its composites is close to 1:2, which is equal to the theoretical stoichiometric ratio of TiO 2 .The measured weight percentage of Pt in the Pt-and Pt/MnO x -loaded products is slightly lower than their respective added contents, while the measured one of Mn in the Mn-and Pt/MnO x -loaded products is lower than 50 of their respective added contents.It indicates that both Pt and Mn species can be successfully decorated on AMS, and Pt can be more effectively loaded on AMS than Mn species under the present photodeposition conditions of cocatalyst. Fig. 2 depicts the FESEM images of the single AMS and its Pt-/MnO xdecorated composites.As seen from Figs. 2a and S2a, the single AMS exhibits a morphology of sea-urchin-like microspheres formed by the accumulation of ultrafine nanorods with diameters of 10 nm (Fig. 2b).After loading with Pt or MnO x , the corresponding composites still exhibit microsphere-like morphology (Figs.2c-f, S2b and S2c).For instance, the 2Pt-AMS composite still displays sea-urchin-like morphology with no obvious change in the surface of those nanorods (Fig. 2c andd), while the 4Mn-AMS composite exhibits slightly changed microsphere morphology with obvious nanoparticles loaded the surface of those nanorods (Fig. 2e andf).Although the Pt-/MnO x -co-loaded product (2Pt-4Mn-AMS) still exhibit microsphere-like structure (Fig. S2d), its morphology (Fig. 2g andh) is also obviously different from the single AMS and the 2Pt-AMS composite (Fig. 2a-d), which may be related to the increased cocatalysts loaded on the surface of those nanorods in the microsphere. From the TEM image (Fig. 3a), it can be also observed that the AMS has sea-urchin-like structure formed by accumulation of nanorods with diameters of 10 nm, and the HRTEM image and the corresponding fast Fourier transform (FFT) pattern (Fig. 3b and its inset) show that the lattice fringe spacing of nanorods is 0.35 nm, corresponding to the dspacing of (1 0 1) facets of anatase TiO 2 , suggesting that those nanorods of AMS are anatase TiO 2 .In addition, the clean surface of those nanorods suggests that the single AMS has high composition and phase purity.However, a small number of nanoparticles (as indicated by the circles in Fig. 3c) can be observed from the surface of those nanorods for the 2Pt-AMS composite.From the HRTEM image and FFT pattern (Fig. 3d and the inset in lower right corner), it can be found that the ultrafine nanoparticles attached to those nanorods have a size of 6.0 nm, and the inset (the upper right corner in Fig. 3d) illustrates that the lattice fringe spacing of ultrafine nanoparticles is 0.23 nm, corresponding to the d-spacing of (1 1 1) facets of cubic Pt 32, which is consistent with the above XRD analysis result.That is, ultrafine Pt nanoparticles (6.0 nm) are attached on the nanorods of AMS after the photodeposition process.Similarly, some ultrafine MnO x nanoparticles are also uniformly dispersed on the nanorods of 4Mn-AMS, and the particle sizes (2.0 nm) are much smaller than that of Pt nanoparticles (Fig. 3e andf).However, no obvious lattice fringe can be distinguished from those ultrafine nanoparticles (Fig. 3f). As for the 2Pt-4Mn-AMS composite, the sea-urchin-like structure of AMS still can be observed (Fig. 3g), but more nanoparticles attached on the surface of those nanorods (Fig. 3h) compared with the 2Pt-AMS and 4Mn-AMS composites.From the HRTEM image (Fig. 3i), it can be found that two kinds of nanoparticles are attached on the surface of those nanorods, one kind of nanoparticles with 6.0 nm in size is similar to the Pt nanoparticles in 2Pt-AMS (Fig. 3d), while the others with much smaller sizes are similar to the MnO x nanoparticles in 4Mn-AMS (Fig. 3f).Although both Pt and MnO x nanoparticles are too small and highly dispersed to distinguish their lattice fringes, the high-angle annular dark field (HAADF) image (Fig. 3j) and the corresponding energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) element mappings (Fig. 3k-n) of 2Pt-4Mn-AMS confirm that Pt and Mn elements are evenly dispered on the surface of those nanorods.The above results indicate that the microstructutre of AMS can be remained during the two-step photodeposition procedure, while the Pt/MnO x dual cocatalysts are successfully decorated on the surface of those nanorods, which will be discussed further below. The specific surface areas (S BET ) and Barret-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) pore size distributions of those samples were determined using liquid N 2 adsorption/desorption experiments.The AMS, 2Pt-AMS, 4Mn-AMS and 2Pt-4Mn-AMS show IV-type isotherms with H3 hysteresis loops with a S BET of 91.8, 102.3, 96.7 and 112.3 m 2 g -1 (Fig. S3a), respectively.It means that the sea-urchin-like structure of AMS leads to a relatively large specific surface area, and thus enables more effective adsorption of the gaseous reactants (CO 2 /H 2 O).Compared with the single AMS, the S BET values of those cocatalyst-decorated composites are enhanced by varying degrees, indicating that the Pt/MnO x nanoparticles are well attached on those nanorods and dispersed in the stacking pores of AMS.The BJH pore size distribution plots (Fig. S3b) shows that the single AMS has a bimodal pore size distribution, while those composites has a unimodal plot with the smaller pore size distribution peak disappeared, possibly due to the filling of Pt and MnO x nanoparticles. To confirm the elemental valence states and compositions of those products, their X-ray photoelectron spectra were determined with the energy scales calibrated using the binding energy (BE) of C1s peak at 285.0 eV.The survey XPS spectra (Fig. S4) show that the single AMS and its composites have strong BE peaks of Ti and O elements in addition to weak C signal originated from the contaminous carbon.However, no obvious BE peaks of Pt and Mn can be observed from the survey spectra of those composites.From the Ti2p high-resolution XPS spectra (Fig. 4a), it can be found that the single AMS and its composites display very similar BE peaks at 458.3/464.0eV with a splitting energy of 5.7 eV, very close to the reported values 41,42, indicating that the loading of Pt and/or MnO x cocatalyst cannot obviously change the valence state of Ti(IV) in anatase TiO 2 of AMS.The single AMS delivers an O1s highresolution XPS spectrum with two BE peaks at 529.5 and 530.9 eV (Fig. 4b), corresponding to the lattice oxygen and surface -OH oxygen atoms of anatase TiO 2 43,44, respectively.Although the 2Pt-AMS, 4Mn-AMS and 2Pt-4Mn-AMS display a lattice oxygen's BE peak at 529.5 eV, very similar to the single AMS, their surface -OH peaks slightly shifted toward higher BE directions (Fig. 4b), indicating the changed surface chemistry of AMS due to the cocatalyst decoration. The Pt4f high-resolution XPS spectra of the 2Pt-AMS and 2Pt-4Mn-AMS composites (Fig. 4c) show a set of BE peaks with a splitting energy of 3.4 eV.Among them, the BE peaks of 2Pt-AMS at 70.2 and 73.6 eV can be classified as Pt4f 7/2 and Pt4f 5/2 of metallic Pt, suggesting that the photodeposition method can completely reduce the Pt(IV) species to metallic Pt 33,34.Compared with 2Pt-AMS, 2Pt-4Mn-AMS displays slight shift in the BE peaks, indicating that the additional MnO x nanoparticles lead to an enhanced interaction of Pt and TiO 2 35.Both 4Mnt-AMS and 2Pt-4Mnt-AMS show very weak BE peak of Mn2p 3/2 at 641 eV, which is located between Mn(II) and Mn(III) species (Fig. 4d), implying that the Mn in those composites might coexist in the mixed valence state of 2/3 42.Also, the weak Mn2p signals further demonstrate the very low actual loading amount as shown in Table S1, possibly due to the difficult photooxidation of Mn 2 species in the absence of electron capturing agent.Therefore, 2Pt-10Mn-AMS composite with higher Mnloading content was applied to confirm the coexistence of Mn 2 /Mn 3 species in those MnO x -decorated samples.As shown in Fig. 4d, the Mn2p high resolution XPS spectrum of 2Pt-10Mn-AMS can be mainly deconvoluted into two groups of BE peaks at 640.8/652.6 and 642.5/654.2eV, which are ascribable to the Mn 2 2p 3/2 /Mn 2 2p 3/2 and Mn 3 2p 1/2 / Mn 3 2p 1/2 42,45, respectively.This result reveals that the mixed valence states of Mn(II)/Mn(III) exist in those MnO x -decorated composites. Control experiments demonstrated that no reduced product can be produced in the photoreaction system without photocatalyst, light irradiation and/or CO 2 gas.It suggests that the CH 4 /CO products are generated from the photoreaction of CO 2 /H 2 O over the photocatalyst.Also, isotopic labeling experiments were conducted under an atmosphere of 13 CO 2 with the 2Pt-Mn-AMS composite as photocatalyst, and an Aligent 6890 N/5975 gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC-MS) was used to analyze the gaseous product.As seen from Fig. S5, the diagnostic peaks of 13 CO (at m/z 29) and 13 CH 4 (at m/z 17) can be observed when 13 CO 2 gas is used as carbon source, while no such peaks can be observed when 12 CO 2 was used, revealing that the CO/CH 4 reduced products are derived from the CO 2 photoreduction process rather than the decomposition of other substances in the photocatalytic system.After that, the photocatalytic CO 2 RR performance of the AMS and its composites are determined.As shown in Fig. 5a, the single AMS exhibits CO/CH 4 yields of 2.01/9.31mol g -1 h -1 , corresponding to a total photoactivity (TCEN) of 78.5 mol g -1 h -1 as calculated with Eq. (1).This CO 2 RR performance can be greatly improved by decorating Pt nanoparticles, and the 2Pt-AMS composite delivers the highest CO/CH 4 yields of 51.6/52.9mol g -1 h -1 with a TCEN of 526.4 mol g -1 h -1 , 5.7 times higher than that of AMS alone.Although the CO 2 RR activities of yMn-AMS composites are much lower than those of xPt-AMS composites, they are still better than that of the single AMS (Fig. 5b).Among those yMn-AMS composites, 4Mn-AMS delivers the best CO/CH 4 yields of 2.69/28.8mol g -1 h -1 , corresponding to a TCEN of 235.8 mol g -1 h -1 , only increased by 2.0 times compared to the single AMS. Since Pt nanoparticles are commonly used as the most efficient cocatalyst for H 2 evolution reaction (HER), a GC-2010 gas chromatograph with a BID detector was used to check whether HER occurs in the current CO 2 RR system, and the corresponding results and those reduced products (CO/CH 4 ) of CO 2 RR and H 2 of H 2 O reduction reaction as well as their product selectivity (defined as the percentage of the yield of a specific reduced product relative to the total yield of all reduced products) are listed in Table S2.As seen, no obvious H 2 is evolved from the photoreaction systems containing the single AMS and the 4Mn-AMS composite, while those Pt-decorated products (2Pt-AMS and 2Pt-4Mn-AMS) deliver a small amount of H 2 with less than 10 H 2 selectivity.The above results indicate that the photoactivity of AMS can be improved by both Pt and MnO x nanoparticles, but the promotion effect of Pt is much more obvious than that of MnO x .Nevertheless, the MnO x loading causes a greatly improved selectivity of CH 4 product (Table S2).For example, the 2Pt-AMS displays an obviously decreased CH 4 selectivity (42.3) compared to that (82.3) of the single AMS, while the 4Mn-AMS delivers much higher CH 4 selectivity (91.4).It suggests that MnO x nanoparticles on AMS can promote the generation of CH 4 during the photocatalytic CO 2 RR process. Compared with the single AMS and its single cocatalyst-decorated composites, the Pt/MnO x dual cocatalysts decorated ones deliver more significant improvement in the photocatalytic CO 2 RR activity (Fig. 5c).Among them, 2Pt-4Mn-AMS shows the best CO 2 RR performance with CO/CH 4 yields of 16.5/125.3mol g -1 h -1 , the corresponding total activity (TCEN) is up to 1035.4 mol g -1 h -1 , which is 13, 2.0 and 3.3 times higher than those of the single AMS, 2Pt-AMS and 4Mn-AMS, respectively.Moreover, the 82.4 of CH 4 selectivity of the 2Pt-4Mn-AMS is much higher than that (42.3) of the 2Pt-AMS.These results indicate that there is a synergistic effect between the Pt/MnO x dual cocatalysts on AMS, which greatly improve the photoactivity and CH 4 selectivity.Based on the CO/CH 4 yields of 2Pt-4Mn-AMS, an apparent quantum yield (AQY), which is defined as the molar percentage of the number of electrons consumed by the reduced products relative to the number of incident photons, can be calculated to be 2.11 (Please refer to the Supplementary Data and Fig. S6 for details).As can be seen from Table S3, the CO/CH 4 yields (16.5/125.3mol g -1 h -1 ) and AQY (2.11) of 2Pt-4Mn-AMS are better than that of most TiO 2 -based photoocatalysts reported recently.Furthermore, when a commercial TiO 2 (P25, Degussa) or a home-made -Al 2 O 3 nanoparticles was used to replace AMS to decorate Pt and MnO x through the same process of 2Pt-4Mn-AMS, the resultant 2Pt-4Mn-Al 2 O 3 shows no any photoactivity, and the 2Pt-4Mn-P25 just delivers CO/CH 4 yields of 55.3/33.1 mol g -1 h -1 with a total activity of 561.8 mol g -1 h -1 and a CH 4 selectivity of 33.1 (Table S2).All of them are much lower than that of the 2Pt-4Mn-AMS.These results demonstrate that photoactive material (i.e.TiO 2 in this situation) are necessary for the photocatalytic CO 2 RR process, and its microstructure has an important influence on the photoactivity. Especially, the synergistic effect of dual cocatalysts on AMS renders the significantly improved CO 2 RR performance, and thus provides a simple yet general strategy for fabricating high-performing CO 2 RR TiO 2 -based photocatalyst. The long-term test result shows that the 2Pt-4Mn-AMS has relatively good photocatalytic stability during the 10 runs of 40 h illumination of Xe-lamp full spectrum (Fig. 5d), in which each run was conducted for 4 h.In each run, the CO/CH 4 produced amounts in the first hour of illumination are much higher than those in the following consecutive three hours of illumination, and the CO/CH 4 evolution amounts gradually decrease with the extension of illumination time.Since the present system delivers obviously high CH 4 selectivity, the average CH 4 rates of the 10 runs were calculated to estimate the photostability of the 2Pt-4Mn-AMS.The result shows that an average CH 4 rate of 52.6 mol g -1 h -1 is obtained in the first run of 4 h illumination, which then decreases to 45.4, 45.0, 44.2, 43.0, 44.4,43.7, 42.8, 43.7 and 42.6 mol g -1 h -1 in the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth and tenth run, respectively.Although the average CH 4 rate of the second run is only 86.4 of that of the first one, the CH 4 rates for the later runs have not obviously decreased compared with that in the second run.Moreover, the XRD pattern of the recovered 2Pt-4Mn-AMS after the consecutive runs is very similar to that of the original one (Fig. S7a), and the survey XPS spectrum (Fig. S7b) as well as those high-resolution Ti2p, O1s, Pb4f Mn2p XPS spectra (Fig. S7c-f) of the recovered photocatalyst are also very similar to that of the original ones.The above results demonstrate that the crystal phase and element valence states of the 2Pt-4Mn-AMS composite are unchanged obviously during the long-term photocatalytic CO 2 RR process, and thus has relatively high photostability. For exploring the enhancement mechanism of CO 2 RR performance over the dual cocatalysts decorated AMS, the optical absorption properties and energy band structures were investigated initially.The UV-Vis diffuse reflectance absorption spectra (DRS, Fig. 6a) show that the single AMS has an absorption edge at 385 nm, and the yMn-AMS composites display very similar DRS spectra only with slight absorption enhancement in the range of 400 600 nm, which may be related to the low MnO x -loading content as mentioned above.However, those xPt-AMS and 2Pt-yMn-AMS composites deliver the characteristic DRS spectra of AMS with strong spectral responses in the range of 400-800 nm, which can be due to the Pt nanoparticles decorated on AMS 36.From the Tauc plot (hv) n -hv, n 2 of AMS (Fig. S8a), the bandgap energy (E g ) can be calculated to be 3.27eV, and its valence band (VB) tom (E VB ) is determined to be 2.33 eV as shown in the valence band XPS spectrum (Fig. S8b).Correspondingly, the conduction band (CB) bottom (E CB ) of AMS can be calculated to be -0.94V according to the formula (E CB E VB -E g ), and thus the energy band structure of AMS is shown in Fig. 6b. Under illumination, the electrons of AMS can be excited from VB to CB and then transferred to the Pt nanoparticles, while the remained holes in VB can transport to the MnO x that can serve as hole collector and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) sites 41,42.The measured O 2 evolution amount in the initial 3 runs during the photostability test process (Fig. 5d) demonstrates that the MnO x loaded on AMS is beneficial for the water oxidization reaction to produce O 2 from the present photoreaction system.Since the CB potential (-0.94 V) is more negative than that of CO 2 /CH 4 redox couple 39, the captured electrons of Pt nanoparticles can promote the CO 2 RR process to produce CH 4 /CO.Generally speaking, the enhanced CO 2 RR activity can be tentatively attributed to the effective photogenerated charge separation induced by the dual-cocatalysts on AMS.This conjecture can be confirmed by the photoluminescence (PL) spectra (Fig. 6c).Under the excitation light of 290 nm, the single AMS shows a strong PL intensity owing to the serious photogenerated charge recombination, while the 2Pt-AMS composite displays greatly reduced PL intensity.It implies that the photogenerated electrons of AMS can migrate to Pt nanoparticles timely, and thus effectively suppress the charge recombination.Similarly, 4Mn-AMS also exhibits a decreased fluorescence intensity but not as significant as the situation of Pt cocatalyst.This may be due to the low decoration content of MnO x on AMS (Table S1) and the migration of photogenerated holes is more difficult than that of electrons.Furthermore, the Pt/MnO x codecorated product (2Pt-4Mn-AMS) shows the weakest PL intensity, which can due to the synergistic effect of dual cocatalysts that cause the photogenerated electrons and holes of AMS to migrate effectively from the AMS to the surface cocatalysts, thus can significantly retard the charge recombination.The transient photocurrent-time (i-t) curves (Fig. 6d) also support this viewpoint, those cocatalyst-decorated composites exhibit much higher photocurrent density than the pure AMS.Once again, the 2Pt-4Mn-AMS has the highest photocurrent density, implying that the Pt/MnO x dual catalysts can not only promote the migration of photogenerated charge carrier to the photocatalyst surface, but also favor the interfacial charge transfer to the reactants during the photocatalytic CO 2 RR process, which can be supported by its best CO 2 RR activity (Fig. 5).These results demonstrate the charge recombination is effectively inhibited by the Pt/MnO x dual cocatalysts on AMS, and thus causing the significantly improved CO 2 RR performance. The effects of cocatalysts on the adsorption/activation capacity of reactants (CO 2 /H 2 O) were further investigated using temperatureprogrammed desorption-mass spectrometry (TPD-MS), in which the CO 2 (M/z 44) and H 2 O (M/z 18) desorbed from sample surface after heating were monitored using mass spectrometry, and the signal peak with temperature below 200 C represents the physical adsorption of CO 2 , while that above 200 C represents the chemisorption of CO 2 on the sample.For instance, the single AMS displays a CO 2 -TPD-MS spectrum (M/z 44) with a signal peak centered at 130 C and a very weak one at 700 C (Fig. 7a), implying that the single AMS has relatively strong physical adsorption ability of CO 2 molecules, while the CO 2 chemisorption capacity is limited.As for the 2Pt-AMS composite, however, the physical adsorption signal peak at 130 C is significantly weakened, while a strong peak appears at 340 C. It indicates that Pt-loading can significantly enhance the chemisorption ability of CO 2 molecules.Compared with 2Pt-AMS, 4Mn-AMS shows a higher CO 2 chemisorption temperature (370 C) with a weaker shoulder at 550 C, implying that 4Mn-AMS has stronger CO 2 chemisorption capacity than 2Pt-AMS.Moreover, the 2Pt-4Mn-AMS displays wider CO 2 desorption curves than the 4Mn-AMS and 2Pt-AMS, which may be due to the synergistic effect of dual cocatalysts that lead to a significant enhancement of CO 2 chemisorption capacity. From the H 2 O-TPD-MS spectra (Fig. 7b), it can be found that the H 2 O desorption peak of the single AMS is located at 300 C, while the 2Pt-AMS has an additional desorption peak at 400 C, indicating that Pt loading enhances the H 2 O chemisorption ability on AMS.In addition, the desorption peak temperatures of 4Mn-AMS and 2Pt-4Mn-AMS are higher than that of AMS and 2Pt-AMS, implying that MnO x loaded on AMS is more beneficial to the chemisorption of H 2 O molecules than Pt nanoparticles.It is worth mentioning that the effect of MnO x as cocatalyst on the AMS surface chemistry is more obvious than that of Pt nanoparticles as shown in Fig. 7a andb.Since it was reported that MnO x on semiconductors can served as hole collector and OER sites 41,42, which can be validated by the fact that O 2 evolution amount increases along with the extension of illumination time (Fig. 5d), it is reasonable to conclude that MnO x on AMS can collect the photogenerated holes to more effectively promote to reaction with the adsorbed H 2 O molecules on it for OER.This conjecture can be supported by the above results that the MnO x on AMS leads to more effective charge separation and interfacial transfer (Fig. 6c,d).In general, the above results demonstrate that Pt/MnO x dual cocatalysts are the key factor to improve the CO 2 /H 2 O adsorption capacity by varying the surface chemistry of AMS, and thus significantly enhance the CO 2 RR activity (Fig. 5). In-situ diffuse reflectance infrared absorption spectra (in-situ DRIFTS) of various samples before and after illumination were measured to further explore the activation ability of reactants.As seen from Fig. 8a, the single AMS without illumination (0 min, in dark) displays a weak IR band of adsorbed H 2 O at 1463 cm -1 , a moderate band of bidentate carbonates (b-CO 3 2-) at 1359 cm -1 with a shoulder at 1334 cm -1 , a strong band of HCOO -at 1610 cm -1 , and strong IR bands of monodentate carbonates (m-CO 3 2-) at 1554/1406 cm -1 with a weak one at 1470 cm -1 464748.Moreover, the IR bands at 1677 and 1250 cm -1 can be assigned to the CO 2 -species on AMS 8,46, suggesting that the electrons could be spontaneously attached to CO 2 from the defective TiO 2 even in dark 46.After illumination, the single AMS displays a changed in-situ DRIFTS spectrum compared with that in dark (0 min).Especially, the signals of the adsorbed H 2 O at 1643 cm -1 , HCOO -at 1610 cm -1 and m-CO After loading with Pt nanoparticles, the resultant 2Pt-AMS in dark exhibits an in situ DRIFTS spectrum (Fig. 8b) obviously different from that of the single AMS in dark (Fig. 8a), whereby those IR peak intensities for H 2 O at 1465 cm -1 , b-CO 3 2-at 1599/1357/1336 cm -1 , m-CO 3 2-at 1555/1542/1470 cm -1 , HCOO -at 1613 cm -1 and CO 2 at 1681/1258 cm -1 are much lower than those of the single AMS in dark, implying that the Pt loading results in a changed surface chemistry of AMS.Nevertheless, the signal enhancements of those IR absorption peaks (at 1645, 1613, 1470 and 1433 cm -1 ) for the 2Pt-AMS are more obvious than that of the single AMS during the illumination, indicating that more H 2 O, HCOO -and HCO 3 2-species are generated on the 2Pt-AMS during the photocatalytic CO 2 RR process, which is the reason for its better CO 2 RR performance compared with the single AMS (Fig. 5a). In addition, the 2Pt-AMS in dark (Fig. 8b) displays more obvious and stronger IR peaks at 1357 and 1336 cm -1 of b-CO 3 2-group (which is conducive to the generation of CO 13) than the single AMS in dark (Fig. 8a).Under illumination, those peak intensities show an increasing trend, which might be the reason that those Pt-decorated AMS composites deliver decreased CH 4 selectivity compared with the single AMS (Fig. 5a).Generally, the in situ DRIFTS spectrum of 4Mn-AMS in dark (Fig. 8c) is similar to that of the single AMS in dark (Fig. 8a), there exists obvious IR absorption bands at 1645, 1610 and 1431 cm -1 , which gradually enhanced along with the extension of illumination time, and thus promote the generation of CH 4 /CO (Fig. 5a).Nevertheless, the 4Mn-AMS after the illumination displays a much lower IR peak at 1470 cm -1 (belonging to m-CO 3 2-) than the single AMS after the illumination, indicating that the MnO x loading changes the surface chemistry and then the adsorption performance of AMS, which will be not conducive to CO production over the 4Mn-AMS.These changes in the adsorption/activation capacity induced by MnO x cocatalyst may be responsible for the higher CH 4 selectivity of 4Mn-AMS during the CO 2 RR process (Fig. 5b and Table S2). The dual cocatalysts decorated product (2Pt-4Mn-AMS) displays the advantages of 2Pt-AMS and 4Mn-AMS (Fig. 8d) under the illumination, and there are a new IR absorption peak at 1433 cm -1 belonging to the HCO 3 -and the more obvious IR absorption peak at 1732 cm -1 belonging to the -CHO group 49.The formation of -CHO group usually requires the acceptance of more photogenerated electrons, and therefore it can be inferred that the relationship between the IR absorption peak at 1732 cm -1 and time is related to the transition of HCOO -(at 1606 cm -1 ) adsorbed on the material surface 49,50.That is, the Pt nanoparticles co-decorated with MnO x can promote the chemisorption of H 2 O/CO 2 molecules on the photocatalyst surface (Fig. 7), and then the formation of the adsorbed HCOO -on the composite surface during the illumination, which can transfer into -CHO induced by the co-existed MnO x , and thus promotes the CH 4 generation during the CO 2 RR process 8,46,49.Therefore, the Pt/MnO x dual catalysts not only promote the photogenerated charge transfer to reactants, but also enhance the CO 2 /H 2 O adsorption/activation capacity of photocatalyst, thus causing the significantly improved CO 2 RR activity and CH 4 selectivity (Fig. 5c).On the bases of the above results and discussion, the possible enhancement mechanism of CO 2 RR performance of the Pt/MnO x dual cocatalysts decorated AMS can be concluded as follows: (1) The cocatalysts can promote the AMS's photogenerated charge separation and transfer; (2) The cocatalysts improves the surface chemistry of AMS and then enhance the adsorption/activation capacity of CO 2 /H 2 O. On one hand, the Pt nanoparticles serve as electron traps to effectively transfer the photogenerated electrons from AMS, and thus plays a main role in improving the charge separation ability and CO 2 RR efficiency.On the other hand, the MnO x sites can act as the sink of photogenerated holes 41,42, but it is less effective than Pt nanoparticles in promoting the charge separation since the migration rate of holes is lower than that of electrons.Nevertheless, MnO x nanoparticles play a major role in improving the surface chemistry of AMS, which can enhance the adsorption/activation capacity of CO 2 /H 2 O, and thus improve the CO 2 RR activity and CH 4 selectivity.In a word, through the synergistic action of Pt and MnO x dual cocatalysts in 2Pt-4Mn-AMS, the rapid separation of photogenerated charge carriers can be realized to inhibit the charge recombination, while the changed surface chemistry of AMS enhance the adsorption/activation capacity of the reactants (CO 2 /H 2 O).Both of them can improve the photocatalytic CO 2 RR activity and CH 4 product selectivity."}, {"llm generation": "Pt and MnOx", "source": "In summary, Pt and MnO x dual cocatalysts decorated sea-urchin-like anatase TiO 2 microspheres (AMS) were synthesized for photocatalytic CO 2 RR application.", "context": "In summary, Pt and MnO x dual cocatalysts decorated sea-urchin-like anatase TiO 2 microspheres (AMS) were synthesized for photocatalytic CO 2 RR application.The effects of the dual cocatalysts on the morphology, microstructure, crystalline phase, photoabsorption, photoelectrochemical behaviors and the reactants (CO 2 /H 2 O) adsorption/ activation capacity were explored based on the characterization results of transient photocurrent, DRS, XPS, PL, TPD-MS and in-situ DRIFTS spectra, and the possible enhancement mechanism of CO 2 RR activity and CH 4 product selectivity of AMS induced by the dual cocatalysts is proposed.That is, the Pt and MnO x cocatalysts can not only promote the fast separation of photogenerated charge carriers to inhibit the charge recombination, but also effectively improve the surface chemical properties of photocatalyst to enhance the CO 2 /H 2 O adsorption/activation capacity, and thus causing the significantly enhanced photocatalytic CO 2 RR performance and CH 4 product selectivity.The synergistic effect of dual cocatalysts in the present system provides a simple yet general strategy for the design of high-efficiency CO 2 RR TiO 2 -based photocatalyst with high CH 4 selectivity.

The photocatalytic CO 2 RR experiment was performed in a gas-closed Pyrex glass reactor (volume of 500 mL) using a 300 W Xe-lamp as light source.Typically, 0.06 g of sample was evenly dispersed on a watch glass (area of 28 cm 2 ) that was placed on a holder in the reactor, then NaHCO 3 (1.60 g) was added into the bottom of reactor.After complete removal of air by vacuum treatment, 5.0 mL of H 2 SO 4 solution (40) was introduced with a syringe to produce CO 2 /H 2 O vapor.During illumination, 2.0 mL of gas was taken out periodically (1.0 h) and detected using a SP-7820 gas chromatograph (TDX-01 column, Rainbow) equipped with a flame ionized detector (FID) and methanator, product contents are calibrated by an external standardization method using commercial standard gas mixture.In addition, H 2 , O 2 , C 2 H 4 , C 2 H 6 and CH 3 OH were checked using a GC-2010 gas chromatograph (BID detector, Shimadzu), and HCOOH, HCHO, CH 3 OH in the acetic ether extract of the solution in the bottom of reactor after the photoreaction process were detected using an Ascend 400 1 H NMR spectrophotometer (Bruker).It was found that in the present CO 2 RR system, CH 4 and CO are the main reduced products, and occasionally some photocatalysts can produce a small amount of H 2 .No other reduced product such as CH 3 OH, C 2 H 4 , C 2 H 6 (using GC-FID or GC-BID detector) or HCOOH, HCHO, CH 3 OH (using 1 H NMR spectrum) is detected. Control experiments demonstrated that no reduced product can be produced in the photoreaction system without photocatalyst, light irradiation or CO 2 gas, suggesting that the CH 4 /CO products are generated from the photoreaction of CO 2 /H 2 O over photocatalyst.Because the main reduced products need to consume different numbers of electrons, total consumed electron number (TCEN) of the produced CH 4 /CO is proposed to evaluate the total photoactivity of CO 2 RR using Eq.

Fig. 2 depicts the FESEM images of the single AMS and its Pt-/MnO xdecorated composites.As seen from Figs. 2a and S2a, the single AMS exhibits a morphology of sea-urchin-like microspheres formed by the accumulation of ultrafine nanorods with diameters of 10 nm (Fig. 2b).After loading with Pt or MnO x , the corresponding composites still exhibit microsphere-like morphology (Figs.2c-f, S2b and S2c).For instance, the 2Pt-AMS composite still displays sea-urchin-like morphology with no obvious change in the surface of those nanorods (Fig. 2c andd), while the 4Mn-AMS composite exhibits slightly changed microsphere morphology with obvious nanoparticles loaded the surface of those nanorods (Fig. 2e andf).Although the Pt-/MnO x -co-loaded product (2Pt-4Mn-AMS) still exhibit microsphere-like structure (Fig. S2d), its morphology (Fig. 2g andh) is also obviously different from the single AMS and the 2Pt-AMS composite (Fig. 2a-d), which may be related to the increased cocatalysts loaded on the surface of those nanorods in the microsphere. From the TEM image (Fig. 3a), it can be also observed that the AMS has sea-urchin-like structure formed by accumulation of nanorods with diameters of 10 nm, and the HRTEM image and the corresponding fast Fourier transform (FFT) pattern (Fig. 3b and its inset) show that the lattice fringe spacing of nanorods is 0.35 nm, corresponding to the dspacing of (1 0 1) facets of anatase TiO 2 , suggesting that those nanorods of AMS are anatase TiO 2 .In addition, the clean surface of those nanorods suggests that the single AMS has high composition and phase purity.However, a small number of nanoparticles (as indicated by the circles in Fig. 3c) can be observed from the surface of those nanorods for the 2Pt-AMS composite.From the HRTEM image and FFT pattern (Fig. 3d and the inset in lower right corner), it can be found that the ultrafine nanoparticles attached to those nanorods have a size of 6.0 nm, and the inset (the upper right corner in Fig. 3d) illustrates that the lattice fringe spacing of ultrafine nanoparticles is 0.23 nm, corresponding to the d-spacing of (1 1 1) facets of cubic Pt 32, which is consistent with the above XRD analysis result.That is, ultrafine Pt nanoparticles (6.0 nm) are attached on the nanorods of AMS after the photodeposition process.Similarly, some ultrafine MnO x nanoparticles are also uniformly dispersed on the nanorods of 4Mn-AMS, and the particle sizes (2.0 nm) are much smaller than that of Pt nanoparticles (Fig. 3e andf).However, no obvious lattice fringe can be distinguished from those ultrafine nanoparticles (Fig. 3f). As for the 2Pt-4Mn-AMS composite, the sea-urchin-like structure of AMS still can be observed (Fig. 3g), but more nanoparticles attached on the surface of those nanorods (Fig. 3h) compared with the 2Pt-AMS and 4Mn-AMS composites.From the HRTEM image (Fig. 3i), it can be found that two kinds of nanoparticles are attached on the surface of those nanorods, one kind of nanoparticles with 6.0 nm in size is similar to the Pt nanoparticles in 2Pt-AMS (Fig. 3d), while the others with much smaller sizes are similar to the MnO x nanoparticles in 4Mn-AMS (Fig. 3f).Although both Pt and MnO x nanoparticles are too small and highly dispersed to distinguish their lattice fringes, the high-angle annular dark field (HAADF) image (Fig. 3j) and the corresponding energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) element mappings (Fig. 3k-n) of 2Pt-4Mn-AMS confirm that Pt and Mn elements are evenly dispered on the surface of those nanorods.The above results indicate that the microstructutre of AMS can be remained during the two-step photodeposition procedure, while the Pt/MnO x dual cocatalysts are successfully decorated on the surface of those nanorods, which will be discussed further below. The specific surface areas (S BET ) and Barret-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) pore size distributions of those samples were determined using liquid N 2 adsorption/desorption experiments.The AMS, 2Pt-AMS, 4Mn-AMS and 2Pt-4Mn-AMS show IV-type isotherms with H3 hysteresis loops with a S BET of 91.8, 102.3, 96.7 and 112.3 m 2 g -1 (Fig. S3a), respectively.It means that the sea-urchin-like structure of AMS leads to a relatively large specific surface area, and thus enables more effective adsorption of the gaseous reactants (CO 2 /H 2 O).Compared with the single AMS, the S BET values of those cocatalyst-decorated composites are enhanced by varying degrees, indicating that the Pt/MnO x nanoparticles are well attached on those nanorods and dispersed in the stacking pores of AMS.The BJH pore size distribution plots (Fig. S3b) shows that the single AMS has a bimodal pore size distribution, while those composites has a unimodal plot with the smaller pore size distribution peak disappeared, possibly due to the filling of Pt and MnO x nanoparticles. To confirm the elemental valence states and compositions of those products, their X-ray photoelectron spectra were determined with the energy scales calibrated using the binding energy (BE) of C1s peak at 285.0 eV.The survey XPS spectra (Fig. S4) show that the single AMS and its composites have strong BE peaks of Ti and O elements in addition to weak C signal originated from the contaminous carbon.However, no obvious BE peaks of Pt and Mn can be observed from the survey spectra of those composites.From the Ti2p high-resolution XPS spectra (Fig. 4a), it can be found that the single AMS and its composites display very similar BE peaks at 458.3/464.0eV with a splitting energy of 5.7 eV, very close to the reported values 41,42, indicating that the loading of Pt and/or MnO x cocatalyst cannot obviously change the valence state of Ti(IV) in anatase TiO 2 of AMS.The single AMS delivers an O1s highresolution XPS spectrum with two BE peaks at 529.5 and 530.9 eV (Fig. 4b), corresponding to the lattice oxygen and surface -OH oxygen atoms of anatase TiO 2 43,44, respectively.Although the 2Pt-AMS, 4Mn-AMS and 2Pt-4Mn-AMS display a lattice oxygen's BE peak at 529.5 eV, very similar to the single AMS, their surface -OH peaks slightly shifted toward higher BE directions (Fig. 4b), indicating the changed surface chemistry of AMS due to the cocatalyst decoration. The Pt4f high-resolution XPS spectra of the 2Pt-AMS and 2Pt-4Mn-AMS composites (Fig. 4c) show a set of BE peaks with a splitting energy of 3.4 eV.Among them, the BE peaks of 2Pt-AMS at 70.2 and 73.6 eV can be classified as Pt4f 7/2 and Pt4f 5/2 of metallic Pt, suggesting that the photodeposition method can completely reduce the Pt(IV) species to metallic Pt 33,34.Compared with 2Pt-AMS, 2Pt-4Mn-AMS displays slight shift in the BE peaks, indicating that the additional MnO x nanoparticles lead to an enhanced interaction of Pt and TiO 2 35.Both 4Mnt-AMS and 2Pt-4Mnt-AMS show very weak BE peak of Mn2p 3/2 at 641 eV, which is located between Mn(II) and Mn(III) species (Fig. 4d), implying that the Mn in those composites might coexist in the mixed valence state of 2/3 42.Also, the weak Mn2p signals further demonstrate the very low actual loading amount as shown in Table S1, possibly due to the difficult photooxidation of Mn 2 species in the absence of electron capturing agent.Therefore, 2Pt-10Mn-AMS composite with higher Mnloading content was applied to confirm the coexistence of Mn 2 /Mn 3 species in those MnO x -decorated samples.As shown in Fig. 4d, the Mn2p high resolution XPS spectrum of 2Pt-10Mn-AMS can be mainly deconvoluted into two groups of BE peaks at 640.8/652.6 and 642.5/654.2eV, which are ascribable to the Mn 2 2p 3/2 /Mn 2 2p 3/2 and Mn 3 2p 1/2 / Mn 3 2p 1/2 42,45, respectively.This result reveals that the mixed valence states of Mn(II)/Mn(III) exist in those MnO x -decorated composites. Control experiments demonstrated that no reduced product can be produced in the photoreaction system without photocatalyst, light irradiation and/or CO 2 gas.It suggests that the CH 4 /CO products are generated from the photoreaction of CO 2 /H 2 O over the photocatalyst.Also, isotopic labeling experiments were conducted under an atmosphere of 13 CO 2 with the 2Pt-Mn-AMS composite as photocatalyst, and an Aligent 6890 N/5975 gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC-MS) was used to analyze the gaseous product.As seen from Fig. S5, the diagnostic peaks of 13 CO (at m/z 29) and 13 CH 4 (at m/z 17) can be observed when 13 CO 2 gas is used as carbon source, while no such peaks can be observed when 12 CO 2 was used, revealing that the CO/CH 4 reduced products are derived from the CO 2 photoreduction process rather than the decomposition of other substances in the photocatalytic system.After that, the photocatalytic CO 2 RR performance of the AMS and its composites are determined.As shown in Fig. 5a, the single AMS exhibits CO/CH 4 yields of 2.01/9.31mol g -1 h -1 , corresponding to a total photoactivity (TCEN) of 78.5 mol g -1 h -1 as calculated with Eq. (1).This CO 2 RR performance can be greatly improved by decorating Pt nanoparticles, and the 2Pt-AMS composite delivers the highest CO/CH 4 yields of 51.6/52.9mol g -1 h -1 with a TCEN of 526.4 mol g -1 h -1 , 5.7 times higher than that of AMS alone.Although the CO 2 RR activities of yMn-AMS composites are much lower than those of xPt-AMS composites, they are still better than that of the single AMS (Fig. 5b).Among those yMn-AMS composites, 4Mn-AMS delivers the best CO/CH 4 yields of 2.69/28.8mol g -1 h -1 , corresponding to a TCEN of 235.8 mol g -1 h -1 , only increased by 2.0 times compared to the single AMS. Since Pt nanoparticles are commonly used as the most efficient cocatalyst for H 2 evolution reaction (HER), a GC-2010 gas chromatograph with a BID detector was used to check whether HER occurs in the current CO 2 RR system, and the corresponding results and those reduced products (CO/CH 4 ) of CO 2 RR and H 2 of H 2 O reduction reaction as well as their product selectivity (defined as the percentage of the yield of a specific reduced product relative to the total yield of all reduced products) are listed in Table S2.As seen, no obvious H 2 is evolved from the photoreaction systems containing the single AMS and the 4Mn-AMS composite, while those Pt-decorated products (2Pt-AMS and 2Pt-4Mn-AMS) deliver a small amount of H 2 with less than 10 H 2 selectivity.The above results indicate that the photoactivity of AMS can be improved by both Pt and MnO x nanoparticles, but the promotion effect of Pt is much more obvious than that of MnO x .Nevertheless, the MnO x loading causes a greatly improved selectivity of CH 4 product (Table S2).For example, the 2Pt-AMS displays an obviously decreased CH 4 selectivity (42.3) compared to that (82.3) of the single AMS, while the 4Mn-AMS delivers much higher CH 4 selectivity (91.4).It suggests that MnO x nanoparticles on AMS can promote the generation of CH 4 during the photocatalytic CO 2 RR process. Compared with the single AMS and its single cocatalyst-decorated composites, the Pt/MnO x dual cocatalysts decorated ones deliver more significant improvement in the photocatalytic CO 2 RR activity (Fig. 5c).Among them, 2Pt-4Mn-AMS shows the best CO 2 RR performance with CO/CH 4 yields of 16.5/125.3mol g -1 h -1 , the corresponding total activity (TCEN) is up to 1035.4 mol g -1 h -1 , which is 13, 2.0 and 3.3 times higher than those of the single AMS, 2Pt-AMS and 4Mn-AMS, respectively.Moreover, the 82.4 of CH 4 selectivity of the 2Pt-4Mn-AMS is much higher than that (42.3) of the 2Pt-AMS.These results indicate that there is a synergistic effect between the Pt/MnO x dual cocatalysts on AMS, which greatly improve the photoactivity and CH 4 selectivity.Based on the CO/CH 4 yields of 2Pt-4Mn-AMS, an apparent quantum yield (AQY), which is defined as the molar percentage of the number of electrons consumed by the reduced products relative to the number of incident photons, can be calculated to be 2.11 (Please refer to the Supplementary Data and Fig. S6 for details).As can be seen from Table S3, the CO/CH 4 yields (16.5/125.3mol g -1 h -1 ) and AQY (2.11) of 2Pt-4Mn-AMS are better than that of most TiO 2 -based photoocatalysts reported recently.Furthermore, when a commercial TiO 2 (P25, Degussa) or a home-made -Al 2 O 3 nanoparticles was used to replace AMS to decorate Pt and MnO x through the same process of 2Pt-4Mn-AMS, the resultant 2Pt-4Mn-Al 2 O 3 shows no any photoactivity, and the 2Pt-4Mn-P25 just delivers CO/CH 4 yields of 55.3/33.1 mol g -1 h -1 with a total activity of 561.8 mol g -1 h -1 and a CH 4 selectivity of 33.1 (Table S2).All of them are much lower than that of the 2Pt-4Mn-AMS.These results demonstrate that photoactive material (i.e.TiO 2 in this situation) are necessary for the photocatalytic CO 2 RR process, and its microstructure has an important influence on the photoactivity. Especially, the synergistic effect of dual cocatalysts on AMS renders the significantly improved CO 2 RR performance, and thus provides a simple yet general strategy for fabricating high-performing CO 2 RR TiO 2 -based photocatalyst. The long-term test result shows that the 2Pt-4Mn-AMS has relatively good photocatalytic stability during the 10 runs of 40 h illumination of Xe-lamp full spectrum (Fig. 5d), in which each run was conducted for 4 h.In each run, the CO/CH 4 produced amounts in the first hour of illumination are much higher than those in the following consecutive three hours of illumination, and the CO/CH 4 evolution amounts gradually decrease with the extension of illumination time.Since the present system delivers obviously high CH 4 selectivity, the average CH 4 rates of the 10 runs were calculated to estimate the photostability of the 2Pt-4Mn-AMS.The result shows that an average CH 4 rate of 52.6 mol g -1 h -1 is obtained in the first run of 4 h illumination, which then decreases to 45.4, 45.0, 44.2, 43.0, 44.4,43.7, 42.8, 43.7 and 42.6 mol g -1 h -1 in the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth and tenth run, respectively.Although the average CH 4 rate of the second run is only 86.4 of that of the first one, the CH 4 rates for the later runs have not obviously decreased compared with that in the second run.Moreover, the XRD pattern of the recovered 2Pt-4Mn-AMS after the consecutive runs is very similar to that of the original one (Fig. S7a), and the survey XPS spectrum (Fig. S7b) as well as those high-resolution Ti2p, O1s, Pb4f Mn2p XPS spectra (Fig. S7c-f) of the recovered photocatalyst are also very similar to that of the original ones.The above results demonstrate that the crystal phase and element valence states of the 2Pt-4Mn-AMS composite are unchanged obviously during the long-term photocatalytic CO 2 RR process, and thus has relatively high photostability. For exploring the enhancement mechanism of CO 2 RR performance over the dual cocatalysts decorated AMS, the optical absorption properties and energy band structures were investigated initially.The UV-Vis diffuse reflectance absorption spectra (DRS, Fig. 6a) show that the single AMS has an absorption edge at 385 nm, and the yMn-AMS composites display very similar DRS spectra only with slight absorption enhancement in the range of 400 600 nm, which may be related to the low MnO x -loading content as mentioned above.However, those xPt-AMS and 2Pt-yMn-AMS composites deliver the characteristic DRS spectra of AMS with strong spectral responses in the range of 400-800 nm, which can be due to the Pt nanoparticles decorated on AMS 36.From the Tauc plot (hv) n -hv, n 2 of AMS (Fig. S8a), the bandgap energy (E g ) can be calculated to be 3.27eV, and its valence band (VB) tom (E VB ) is determined to be 2.33 eV as shown in the valence band XPS spectrum (Fig. S8b).Correspondingly, the conduction band (CB) bottom (E CB ) of AMS can be calculated to be -0.94V according to the formula (E CB E VB -E g ), and thus the energy band structure of AMS is shown in Fig. 6b. Under illumination, the electrons of AMS can be excited from VB to CB and then transferred to the Pt nanoparticles, while the remained holes in VB can transport to the MnO x that can serve as hole collector and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) sites 41,42.The measured O 2 evolution amount in the initial 3 runs during the photostability test process (Fig. 5d) demonstrates that the MnO x loaded on AMS is beneficial for the water oxidization reaction to produce O 2 from the present photoreaction system.Since the CB potential (-0.94 V) is more negative than that of CO 2 /CH 4 redox couple 39, the captured electrons of Pt nanoparticles can promote the CO 2 RR process to produce CH 4 /CO.Generally speaking, the enhanced CO 2 RR activity can be tentatively attributed to the effective photogenerated charge separation induced by the dual-cocatalysts on AMS.This conjecture can be confirmed by the photoluminescence (PL) spectra (Fig. 6c).Under the excitation light of 290 nm, the single AMS shows a strong PL intensity owing to the serious photogenerated charge recombination, while the 2Pt-AMS composite displays greatly reduced PL intensity.It implies that the photogenerated electrons of AMS can migrate to Pt nanoparticles timely, and thus effectively suppress the charge recombination.Similarly, 4Mn-AMS also exhibits a decreased fluorescence intensity but not as significant as the situation of Pt cocatalyst.This may be due to the low decoration content of MnO x on AMS (Table S1) and the migration of photogenerated holes is more difficult than that of electrons.Furthermore, the Pt/MnO x codecorated product (2Pt-4Mn-AMS) shows the weakest PL intensity, which can due to the synergistic effect of dual cocatalysts that cause the photogenerated electrons and holes of AMS to migrate effectively from the AMS to the surface cocatalysts, thus can significantly retard the charge recombination.The transient photocurrent-time (i-t) curves (Fig. 6d) also support this viewpoint, those cocatalyst-decorated composites exhibit much higher photocurrent density than the pure AMS.Once again, the 2Pt-4Mn-AMS has the highest photocurrent density, implying that the Pt/MnO x dual catalysts can not only promote the migration of photogenerated charge carrier to the photocatalyst surface, but also favor the interfacial charge transfer to the reactants during the photocatalytic CO 2 RR process, which can be supported by its best CO 2 RR activity (Fig. 5).These results demonstrate the charge recombination is effectively inhibited by the Pt/MnO x dual cocatalysts on AMS, and thus causing the significantly improved CO 2 RR performance. The effects of cocatalysts on the adsorption/activation capacity of reactants (CO 2 /H 2 O) were further investigated using temperatureprogrammed desorption-mass spectrometry (TPD-MS), in which the CO 2 (M/z 44) and H 2 O (M/z 18) desorbed from sample surface after heating were monitored using mass spectrometry, and the signal peak with temperature below 200 C represents the physical adsorption of CO 2 , while that above 200 C represents the chemisorption of CO 2 on the sample.For instance, the single AMS displays a CO 2 -TPD-MS spectrum (M/z 44) with a signal peak centered at 130 C and a very weak one at 700 C (Fig. 7a), implying that the single AMS has relatively strong physical adsorption ability of CO 2 molecules, while the CO 2 chemisorption capacity is limited.As for the 2Pt-AMS composite, however, the physical adsorption signal peak at 130 C is significantly weakened, while a strong peak appears at 340 C. It indicates that Pt-loading can significantly enhance the chemisorption ability of CO 2 molecules.Compared with 2Pt-AMS, 4Mn-AMS shows a higher CO 2 chemisorption temperature (370 C) with a weaker shoulder at 550 C, implying that 4Mn-AMS has stronger CO 2 chemisorption capacity than 2Pt-AMS.Moreover, the 2Pt-4Mn-AMS displays wider CO 2 desorption curves than the 4Mn-AMS and 2Pt-AMS, which may be due to the synergistic effect of dual cocatalysts that lead to a significant enhancement of CO 2 chemisorption capacity. From the H 2 O-TPD-MS spectra (Fig. 7b), it can be found that the H 2 O desorption peak of the single AMS is located at 300 C, while the 2Pt-AMS has an additional desorption peak at 400 C, indicating that Pt loading enhances the H 2 O chemisorption ability on AMS.In addition, the desorption peak temperatures of 4Mn-AMS and 2Pt-4Mn-AMS are higher than that of AMS and 2Pt-AMS, implying that MnO x loaded on AMS is more beneficial to the chemisorption of H 2 O molecules than Pt nanoparticles.It is worth mentioning that the effect of MnO x as cocatalyst on the AMS surface chemistry is more obvious than that of Pt nanoparticles as shown in Fig. 7a andb.Since it was reported that MnO x on semiconductors can served as hole collector and OER sites 41,42, which can be validated by the fact that O 2 evolution amount increases along with the extension of illumination time (Fig. 5d), it is reasonable to conclude that MnO x on AMS can collect the photogenerated holes to more effectively promote to reaction with the adsorbed H 2 O molecules on it for OER.This conjecture can be supported by the above results that the MnO x on AMS leads to more effective charge separation and interfacial transfer (Fig. 6c,d).In general, the above results demonstrate that Pt/MnO x dual cocatalysts are the key factor to improve the CO 2 /H 2 O adsorption capacity by varying the surface chemistry of AMS, and thus significantly enhance the CO 2 RR activity (Fig. 5). In-situ diffuse reflectance infrared absorption spectra (in-situ DRIFTS) of various samples before and after illumination were measured to further explore the activation ability of reactants.As seen from Fig. 8a, the single AMS without illumination (0 min, in dark) displays a weak IR band of adsorbed H 2 O at 1463 cm -1 , a moderate band of bidentate carbonates (b-CO 3 2-) at 1359 cm -1 with a shoulder at 1334 cm -1 , a strong band of HCOO -at 1610 cm -1 , and strong IR bands of monodentate carbonates (m-CO 3 2-) at 1554/1406 cm -1 with a weak one at 1470 cm -1 464748.Moreover, the IR bands at 1677 and 1250 cm -1 can be assigned to the CO 2 -species on AMS 8,46, suggesting that the electrons could be spontaneously attached to CO 2 from the defective TiO 2 even in dark 46.After illumination, the single AMS displays a changed in-situ DRIFTS spectrum compared with that in dark (0 min).Especially, the signals of the adsorbed H 2 O at 1643 cm -1 , HCOO -at 1610 cm -1 and m-CO After loading with Pt nanoparticles, the resultant 2Pt-AMS in dark exhibits an in situ DRIFTS spectrum (Fig. 8b) obviously different from that of the single AMS in dark (Fig. 8a), whereby those IR peak intensities for H 2 O at 1465 cm -1 , b-CO 3 2-at 1599/1357/1336 cm -1 , m-CO 3 2-at 1555/1542/1470 cm -1 , HCOO -at 1613 cm -1 and CO 2 at 1681/1258 cm -1 are much lower than those of the single AMS in dark, implying that the Pt loading results in a changed surface chemistry of AMS.Nevertheless, the signal enhancements of those IR absorption peaks (at 1645, 1613, 1470 and 1433 cm -1 ) for the 2Pt-AMS are more obvious than that of the single AMS during the illumination, indicating that more H 2 O, HCOO -and HCO 3 2-species are generated on the 2Pt-AMS during the photocatalytic CO 2 RR process, which is the reason for its better CO 2 RR performance compared with the single AMS (Fig. 5a). In addition, the 2Pt-AMS in dark (Fig. 8b) displays more obvious and stronger IR peaks at 1357 and 1336 cm -1 of b-CO 3 2-group (which is conducive to the generation of CO 13) than the single AMS in dark (Fig. 8a).Under illumination, those peak intensities show an increasing trend, which might be the reason that those Pt-decorated AMS composites deliver decreased CH 4 selectivity compared with the single AMS (Fig. 5a).Generally, the in situ DRIFTS spectrum of 4Mn-AMS in dark (Fig. 8c) is similar to that of the single AMS in dark (Fig. 8a), there exists obvious IR absorption bands at 1645, 1610 and 1431 cm -1 , which gradually enhanced along with the extension of illumination time, and thus promote the generation of CH 4 /CO (Fig. 5a).Nevertheless, the 4Mn-AMS after the illumination displays a much lower IR peak at 1470 cm -1 (belonging to m-CO 3 2-) than the single AMS after the illumination, indicating that the MnO x loading changes the surface chemistry and then the adsorption performance of AMS, which will be not conducive to CO production over the 4Mn-AMS.These changes in the adsorption/activation capacity induced by MnO x cocatalyst may be responsible for the higher CH 4 selectivity of 4Mn-AMS during the CO 2 RR process (Fig. 5b and Table S2). The dual cocatalysts decorated product (2Pt-4Mn-AMS) displays the advantages of 2Pt-AMS and 4Mn-AMS (Fig. 8d) under the illumination, and there are a new IR absorption peak at 1433 cm -1 belonging to the HCO 3 -and the more obvious IR absorption peak at 1732 cm -1 belonging to the -CHO group 49.The formation of -CHO group usually requires the acceptance of more photogenerated electrons, and therefore it can be inferred that the relationship between the IR absorption peak at 1732 cm -1 and time is related to the transition of HCOO -(at 1606 cm -1 ) adsorbed on the material surface 49,50.That is, the Pt nanoparticles co-decorated with MnO x can promote the chemisorption of H 2 O/CO 2 molecules on the photocatalyst surface (Fig. 7), and then the formation of the adsorbed HCOO -on the composite surface during the illumination, which can transfer into -CHO induced by the co-existed MnO x , and thus promotes the CH 4 generation during the CO 2 RR process 8,46,49.Therefore, the Pt/MnO x dual catalysts not only promote the photogenerated charge transfer to reactants, but also enhance the CO 2 /H 2 O adsorption/activation capacity of photocatalyst, thus causing the significantly improved CO 2 RR activity and CH 4 selectivity (Fig. 5c).On the bases of the above results and discussion, the possible enhancement mechanism of CO 2 RR performance of the Pt/MnO x dual cocatalysts decorated AMS can be concluded as follows: (1) The cocatalysts can promote the AMS's photogenerated charge separation and transfer; (2) The cocatalysts improves the surface chemistry of AMS and then enhance the adsorption/activation capacity of CO 2 /H 2 O. On one hand, the Pt nanoparticles serve as electron traps to effectively transfer the photogenerated electrons from AMS, and thus plays a main role in improving the charge separation ability and CO 2 RR efficiency.On the other hand, the MnO x sites can act as the sink of photogenerated holes 41,42, but it is less effective than Pt nanoparticles in promoting the charge separation since the migration rate of holes is lower than that of electrons.Nevertheless, MnO x nanoparticles play a major role in improving the surface chemistry of AMS, which can enhance the adsorption/activation capacity of CO 2 /H 2 O, and thus improve the CO 2 RR activity and CH 4 selectivity.In a word, through the synergistic action of Pt and MnO x dual cocatalysts in 2Pt-4Mn-AMS, the rapid separation of photogenerated charge carriers can be realized to inhibit the charge recombination, while the changed surface chemistry of AMS enhance the adsorption/activation capacity of the reactants (CO 2 /H 2 O).Both of them can improve the photocatalytic CO 2 RR activity and CH 4 product selectivity."}], "reactor type": [], "operation mode": [{"llm generation": "Batch", "source": "The photocatalytic CO 2 RR experiment was performed in a gas-closed Pyrex glass reactor (volume of 500 mL) using a 300 W Xe-lamp as light source.Typically, 0.06 g of sample was evenly dispersed on a watch glass (area of 28 cm 2 ) that was placed on a holder in the reactor, then NaHCO 3 (1.60 g) was added into the bottom of reactor.After complete removal of air by vacuum treatment, 5.0 mL of H 2 SO 4 solution (40) was introduced with a syringe to produce CO 2 /H 2 O vapor.During illumination, 2.0 mL of gas was taken out periodically (1.0 h) and detected using a SP-7820 gas chromatograph (TDX-01 column, Rainbow) equipped with a flame ionized detector (FID) and methanator, product contents are calibrated by an external standardization method using commercial standard gas mixture.", "context": "Typically, 0.60 g of commercial TiO 2 nanoparticles (P25, Degussa) were dispersed in a H 2 O 2 /NaOH mixed solution containing 30 H 2 O 2 (8.0 mL) and 10 M NaOH (60 mL) under stirring.The resulting suspension was transferred into a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)-lined stainless autoclave (100 mL volume) and hydrothermally treated at 160 C for 2 h.After cooling down, the product was collected by centrifugation and washed with deionized water to give the precursor, which was re-dispersed in a hydrochloric acid solution (0.2 M, 150 mL) and stirred overnight.The precipitate was collected through centrifugation, washing with water and ethanol and drying at 70 C in vacuum, and then calcined at 500 C in air for 3 h to obtain the AMS.

CHI Model 618C electrochemical analyzer was used to obtain the transient photocurrent curves in a three-electrode system with Pt wire, Pt plate and saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as work, counter and reference electrode, respectively.Work electrode was fabricated by depositing Nafion suspension (0.20 mL) containing sample (10 mg) on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass (1.0 1.0 cm 2 ), and drying at 70 C for 1 h to volatilize the solvent and steady the film.During the photoelectrochemical measurement, the three electrodes were immersed into an electrolyte containing Na 2 SO 4 solution (0.5 M) and methyl viologen (3.0 mg) as electron media, which was continuously purged by N 2 flow for 30 min before illumination. Temperature-programmed desorption-mass spectrometry (TPD-MS) of reactants (CO 2 /H 2 O) on sample was performed on a Micromeritics Autochem II-Cirrus 2 Chemisorption Analyzer.The sample was heated to 200 C with a heating rate of 10 C min -1 in Ar atmosphere and maintained at this temperature for 2 h to remove the adsorbate.After cooling to 80 C, a wet 10 CO 2 /Ar mixed gas replaced the Ar flow for the CO 2 /H 2 O adsorption for 90 min, and the excessive CO 2 /H 2 O molecules were purged with Ar flow for 1 h (All flow rates are set at 30 mL min -1 ).After that, TCD detector started to record the signals until the temperature raised to 900 C, and the desorbed gas during the H 2 O/CO 2 -TPD process was installed to a quadruple mass spectrometer (MKS Instrument) operating in multiple-ion-monitoring (MIM) mode to record the mass signals of CO 2 (M/z 44) and H 2 O (M/z 18).In-situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectra (DRIFTS) of reactants (CO 2 /H 2 O) on sample under light irradiation were measured on a Thermo Electron Nicolet iS50 spectrometer equipped with liquid N 2 cooled HgCdTe (MCT/A) detector with a resolution of 4 cm -1 by using 64 scans.Typically, sample (0.05 g) was dispersed on the DRIFTS accessory, then vacuum treatment at 200 C for 60 min was conducted for removing the air.After that, humid CO 2 gas (50 mL) was introduced into the reactor until 1 atm.Once the IR spectrum is stabilized, the sample was irradiated with 300 W Xe-lamp through a quartz window, and IR spectrum was collected when it was stabilized again. The photocatalytic CO 2 RR experiment was performed in a gas-closed Pyrex glass reactor (volume of 500 mL) using a 300 W Xe-lamp as light source.Typically, 0.06 g of sample was evenly dispersed on a watch glass (area of 28 cm 2 ) that was placed on a holder in the reactor, then NaHCO 3 (1.60 g) was added into the bottom of reactor.After complete removal of air by vacuum treatment, 5.0 mL of H 2 SO 4 solution (40) was introduced with a syringe to produce CO 2 /H 2 O vapor.During illumination, 2.0 mL of gas was taken out periodically (1.0 h) and detected using a SP-7820 gas chromatograph (TDX-01 column, Rainbow) equipped with a flame ionized detector (FID) and methanator, product contents are calibrated by an external standardization method using commercial standard gas mixture.In addition, H 2 , O 2 , C 2 H 4 , C 2 H 6 and CH 3 OH were checked using a GC-2010 gas chromatograph (BID detector, Shimadzu), and HCOOH, HCHO, CH 3 OH in the acetic ether extract of the solution in the bottom of reactor after the photoreaction process were detected using an Ascend 400 1 H NMR spectrophotometer (Bruker).It was found that in the present CO 2 RR system, CH 4 and CO are the main reduced products, and occasionally some photocatalysts can produce a small amount of H 2 .No other reduced product such as CH 3 OH, C 2 H 4 , C 2 H 6 (using GC-FID or GC-BID detector) or HCOOH, HCHO, CH 3 OH (using 1 H NMR spectrum) is detected. Control experiments demonstrated that no reduced product can be produced in the photoreaction system without photocatalyst, light irradiation or CO 2 gas, suggesting that the CH 4 /CO products are generated from the photoreaction of CO 2 /H 2 O over photocatalyst.Because the main reduced products need to consume different numbers of electrons, total consumed electron number (TCEN) of the produced CH 4 /CO is proposed to evaluate the total photoactivity of CO 2 RR using Eq. ( 1) 3,4,8: where V rea. is the volume of reactor; m cat. is the photocatalyst amount; t irr. is the illumination time; c CO and c CH4 are the produced concentrations of CO and CH 4 , respectively."}]}}
