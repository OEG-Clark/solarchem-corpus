The potential position of the conduction band of the supporting oxides was determined by the Mott-Schottky-plot from the flat band potential measured with a three-electrode chemical cell (VersaSTAT4 (AMETEK)). 2123The following three electrodes were used.(1) a metal oxide dispersed on a fluorinedoped tin oxide substrate followed by calcination at 823 K, (2) a Pt wire counter electrode, and (3) an Ag/AgCl reference electrode, and an aqueous Na 2 SO 4 solution (0.5 M, pH 7.4).The flat band potential (E 0 ) of the oxide at pH 0 vs SHE (standard hydrogen electrode) was extrapolated from the observed potential (E) using the relation of E E 0 -0.059pH and the electrode potential of Ag/AgCl was set to be 0.199V (vs.SHE, 25 C).
