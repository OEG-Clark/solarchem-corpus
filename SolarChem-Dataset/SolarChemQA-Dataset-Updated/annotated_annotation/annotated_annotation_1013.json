indicating that the condensation catalyst AlCl3 was almost removed.", "context": "The COPs were mainly synthesized according to previous works. 51,52ittle modification was made for the fabrication of hollow COPs, in which SiO2 nanoparticle was used as template and was subsequently removed by dissolving in hydrogen flouride aqueous solution (the detail procedure see experimental section). 42e morphologies of all samples were revealed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).As indicated by SEM shown in (Figure s1), both h-COP-P and sh-COP-P display uniform spherical structure with an approximate averaged diameter no more than 150 nm, inherited from the template of SiO2 particles of about 140nm.The formation of hollow structure was revealed by TEM observation (Figure 1a,b) for h-COP-P and sh-COP-P, with a shell thickness of about 10 nm.Spherical particle of COP-P and s-COP-P were observed as shown in Figure S1.According to our previous works, the surface areas were predicted to be 647 m 2 /g (COP-P), 869.94 m 2 /g (h-COP-P), and 335.91 m 2 /g (sh-COP-P), respectively. The chemical structure of target COPs was characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), and the spectra shown in Figure S2 are in consistent with former reports. 51Its been indicated in previous works the sulfonic group was introduced on biphenyl groups. 52Furthermore, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was used to evaluate the sulfonation effect (see Table S1).It's indicated that, the sulphur content approximates to 5.81 wt for s-COP-P and 6.12 wt for sh-COP-P, respectively, after 1 h sulfonation at 100 oC, both nearly corresponding to two sulfonic groups per porphyrin unit.No obvious increasing of sulphur content was observed upon prolonging sulfonation time even to 12 hours.The residue content of Al is less than 0.2 for all polymers (see Table S1), indicating that the condensation catalyst AlCl3 was almost removed.Meanwhile, elemental analyses were also recorded for these COPs, to evaluate the extent of possible carbonization occurred during sulfonation.From the data as shown in Table S2, the elemental content of four kinds of COPs differs from each other and from that of calculated value, which is often observed for organic polymer probably due to the complicated polymerization processes and the products.Notably, no remarkable increasing of C content and decreasing of H content was observed upon sulfonation, indicating that the carbonization caused by sulfonation is negligible.The sulfonation of organic polymers was also investigated in some reported studies, 36,53 in which no notable carbonization was observed. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was also measured to analyse the surface electronic structure.Comparison of the spectra of four COPs was shown in Figure S3, the peaks assignable to C, N, O, Cl were observed for COP-P and h-COP-P.The observed Cl2p signal around 198 eV was ascribed to the residual Cl element derived from AlCl3, which is hard to be eliminated completely through simple washing.For s-COP-P and sh-COP-P, both the spectra possess an obvious peaks assignable to S and much enhanced O peaks.Take sh-COP-P as example (Figure 1), the bonding energies of C1s at 284.8, 286.3 and 288.7 eV should be assigned to C(sp 2 )C(sp 2 ), C-N, and OC-O, respectively (see Figure 1c).For the non-sulfonated COP-Ps, The N1s could be deconvoluted into two sub-peaks at 398.1 and 400.3 eV, corresponding to non-protonated and protonated pyrrolic N, respectively. 54In the case of sulfonated COP-Ps, only one peak at 400.3 eV was observed for the four protonated pyrrolic N (Figure 1d), caused probably by the migration of the proton of sulfonic acid group. 16,36The S1s peak (Figure .1e) locating at 168.57eV corresponds to -SO3 -group.The O1s peak(Fig.1f) can Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins be deconvoluted into two peaks with binding energies at 532.8 and 531.6eV, respectively, assignable to SO3 -and adsorbed CO2. 36milar assignment were made for COP-P (Figure S4), h-COP-P (Figure S5) and s-COP-P (Figure S6). The photoreduction of CO2 requires that catalysts have proper electronic energy structure.That is, the catalysts should have a more negative conduction band minimum (CBM) potential than CO2 reduction (for instance, CO/CO2, theoretically -0.52 V vs NHE), and a more positive valence band maximum (VBM) potential than the oxidation potential of sacrifice agent (for example, O2/H2O, theoretically 0.82 V vs NHE). 555665758 Here, Mott-Schottky measurements were first carried out to determine the conduction band edges of COPs.As illustrated in Figure 2a, Figure S7, S8 and S9, the C -2 vs potential plots of four COPs were recorded at 100, 500, and 1000 Hz, respectively.All curves show positive slope, unveiling the n-type semiconductors nature of them.The flat band potential derived through the intersection point of fitting straight line with x axis is very close to the bottom of the conduction band of n-type semiconductor, 16,35 which was -0.80,-0.97,-0.96 and -0.67 V ( vs NHE), respectively, for COP-P, h-COP-P, s-COP-P and sh-COP-P.The UV-Vis diffuse reflection absorption spectra were usually utilized to predict the band gap of the catalyst.Notably, all four COPs are black colour and exhibit a broad light absorption extending from UV to near infrared region (Fig 2b), owing probably to the electronic orbits coupling of porphyrin units.The corresponding Tauc-plot were deduced as (Ah) 2 vs Energy (in eV) plots were shown in Fig 2c .The obtained band gap is about 1.80 eV for all four COPs, which is slightly larger than other reported porphyrin polymers. 28According to these experimental data, the VBs and CBs of all COPs were predicted and depicted together in Fig 2d (detailed data see Table s3).It is indicated that all four COPs have a more negative CB than the reduction potential of CO2 to most investigated products, including CO, CH4, CH3OH, CH2O, and HCOOH. 555665758 They also possess a more positive VB than the oxidation potential of H2O to O2.Taken together, the band structure of the four polymers qualified theoretically them to be photocatalysts for the reduction of CO2 with H2O as sacrificing reagent. Inspired by above analysing result of electronic structure of porphyrin polymers, we further explore their photocatalytic performance in reducing CO2, with a 300W Xe lamp as light source. To guarantee the accuracy, the photocatalytic experiment was carried out independently for three times under the same condition, and the averaged data were used to evaluate the photocatalytic ability for all catalysts.For comparison, the catalytic activity of TPBB monomer and commercial TiO2 (P25) were first measured (Figure S10 and Table S4).All of the production of CO, CH3OH and CH4 were undetectable for TPBB within 1 h.While for P25, the formation of CO and CH4 was observed with an output of 0.92 and 0.13 mol g -1 within 1 h, respectively.In the case of COP-P (Figure 3a), CO was produced with a yield of 1.23 mol g -1 within 1 h, which unveils the better photocatalytic activity of COP-P than P25 in reducing CO2 into CO.However, the performance of h-COP-P and s-COP-P is not encouraging, with a CO yield of 1.80 and 0.86 molg -1 , respectively.This indicates neither hollowlization nor sulfonation, when acting solely, can effectively improve the photocatalytic performance of porphyrin polymer.Interestingly, when hollowlization and sulfonation was introduced together as observed for sh-COP-P, significantly enhanced yield of CO, 7.54 molg -1 within 1 h, was obtained.It should be noted that the surface-active sites are easily occupied by the products or intermediate, resulting in the attenuation of the catalytic activity with time going on.Meanwhile, both the production of CH4 and CH3OH were no more than 0.05molg -1 within 1 h for all four COPs (see Fig S10 and Table S4), revealing the highly selective formation of CO (selectivity 96).Within 4 h, the output of CO increased continuously, and the averaged production rates were about 4.58, 1.92, 0.92, and 0.5 molg -1 h -1 for sh-COP-P, h-COP-P, COP-P and s-COP-P, respectively (Figure 3b). To identify the origins of CO, control experiments were repeated under Ar atmosphere, and the production of CO was undetectable.This manifests that CO was indeed originated from the reduction of CO2.In addition, the stabilities of COPs were also testified by XPS characterization after photocatalysis (Fig S11 -S14), which show similar pattern to that before photocatalysis, indicating unaltered surface electronic structure of COPs before and after reaction. To elucidate the different performance of these four COPs, further analyses were required.Considering the closely dependence of photocatalytic activity on the separation efficiency of photogenerated carries and their migration ability to the surface of catalyst, the photoelectrical properties were investigated for these polymer catalysts and compared with each other.First, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was recorded in the dark environment, to evaluate the migrate ability of photogenerated electron to surface reactive site. 9,35,50As shown in Fig 4a, the EIS show semicircle arc at high frequencies for all polymers, which may be used to evaluate electron-transfer resistance (Ret) across the electrode/electrolyte.It's clearly indicated that both hollowlization and sulfonation can moderately lower the resistance, due probably to the polar environment caused by sulfonation that favours the moving of electron or the short transfer path to the surface of hollow structure.Nevertheless, the difference in resistance is slight for h-COP-P, s-COP-P and sh-COP-P, and cannot account for their significantly different performance in photocatalytic reduction of CO2.The transient amperometric I-t curves under light irradiation could give a direct evaluation about the separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers, 35,50,585960 and were also recorded here.As shown in Figure 4b, quick response of photocurrent was observed to the turn-on and -off of irradiation light, indicating the high migrating speed of photogenerated carriers to the electrode under bias for all four COPs.Furthermore, the photocurrent exhibits good repeatability and the intensity approaches to a constant value after ten cycles, indicating the stable formation of photogenerated electrons and holes upon light irradiation after the initial activation.Detailedly comparing the I-t curves reveals that two sulfonated polymers, s-COP-P and sh-COP-P, display much enhanced photocurrent than the pristine polymer COP-P and h-COP-P, respectively, manifesting that sulfonation was an effective method to improve the separation efficiency of photogenerated electrons and holes.This may be ascribed to the polar environment induced by the substitution of sulfonic acid group.Meanwhile, the larger photocurrent of h-COP-P than that COP-P also verifies the positive effect of hollow structure on the separation of photogenerated carriers, as indicated in references. 50urprisingly, s-COP-P displays a photocurrent as high as that of sh-COP-P, which might be ascribed to the great influence of sulfonation that overwhelms that of hollowlization effect.However, this photocurrent performance is not consistent with the photocatalytic result.Particularly, s-COP-P exhibits the largest photocurrent but the poorest photocatalytic yield of CO.Further investigation should be made to interpret the performance of COPs in the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 It is worth noting that the photocatalytic reaction here was carried out in a heterogeneous system, and thereby, the photocatalytic efficiency depends not only on the electrical and photoelectrical properties of catalysts, but also on their adsorption ability toward CO2.It has been revealed in previous work that sulfonation would result in a much decreased surface area, and thereafter decrease the gas adsorption capacity. 5152253 The CO2 adsorption capacity was measured for these polymers.As shown in Figure S15, the postsulfonation results in a significantly reduced CO2 adsorption capacity of 12.8 cm 3 /g for s-COP-P relative to the 46.5 cm 3 /g of COP-P at 298 K and 1.1 atm.This would lead to a poor photocatalytic performance for s-COP-P.Meanwhile, a moderate CO2 adsorption capacity of 25.8 cm 3 /g was observed for sh-COP-P, owing to the hollow structure that possesses less dead volume than s-COP-P.Consequently, the much improved photoresponse ability combined with the moderate adsorption capacity of CO2 leads to a much improved photocatalytic performance of sh-COP-P as compared to the other three COPs in reducing CO2 Considering the dual impact of sulfonation, several sh-COP-P samples were synthesized under different sulfonation time and temperature.As shown in Fig S16 and Table S5, the sulphur content in sh-COP-P increases with the reaction time and temperature, indicating the enhancement of sulfonation degree.Meanwhile, an improved photocatalytic performance is observed for the reduction of CO2 into CO.The sample under sulfonation at 100 oC for 60 min performs best. At last, the possible intrinsic mechanism of photocatalysed CO2 reduction by polymers was proposed on the basis of energy band structure analyses.As shown in Figure 2d, upon light irradiation, the electrons are excited from the VB to the CB of polymers, leaving holes in the corresponding position of the VB.And then, the photogenerated carriers, including holes and electrons, migrate to the surface of polymers.The holes are captured by water molecules absorbed on the surface of the catalyst, oxidating H2O into O2 (0.82 V vs. NHE), while the electrons react with the adsorbed CO2 and reduce it into CO (-0.52 V, vs NHE)."}, {"llm generation": "tetrabiphenylporphyrin-based COPs (COP-Ps)", "source": "In summary, in order to reveal the influence of different morphology and post-functionalization, a series of tetrabiphenylporphyrin-based COPs (COP-Ps) were investigated as photocatalysts in reducing CO2 with H2O as electron donor.", "context": "In summary, in order to reveal the influence of different morphology and post-functionalization, a series of tetrabiphenylporphyrin-based COPs (COP-Ps) were investigated as photocatalysts in reducing CO2 with H2O as electron donor.For all COP-Ps, the photogenerated CO is dominant while other products such as CH4 and CH3OH are negligible.Interestingly, it was indicated that post-sulfonation, though improving the photogenerated current markedly, exhibits different influence to the photocatalytic activity of solid COP-P and the hollow one (h-COP-P).For COP-P (s-COP-P), the post-sulfonation would reduce markedly the photocatalytic activity, owing to the resultant reduced surface area and thus the reduced CO2 uptake.Whereas for the h-COP-P, moderate CO2 uptake is still remained after postsulfonation and thereby give about 4 times enhancement of CO2 production.Our work testified that the design and fabrication of gas-solid phase photocatalysts should give consideration to both of the photoresponse ability and gas adsorption.

The chemical structure of target COPs was characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), and the spectra shown in Figure S2 are in consistent with former reports. 51Its been indicated in previous works the sulfonic group was introduced on biphenyl groups. 52Furthermore, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was used to evaluate the sulfonation effect (see Table S1).It's indicated that, the sulphur content approximates to 5.81 wt for s-COP-P and 6.12 wt for sh-COP-P, respectively, after 1 h sulfonation at 100 oC, both nearly corresponding to two sulfonic groups per porphyrin unit.No obvious increasing of sulphur content was observed upon prolonging sulfonation time even to 12 hours.The residue content of Al is less than 0.2 for all polymers (see Table S1), indicating that the condensation catalyst AlCl3 was almost removed.Meanwhile, elemental analyses were also recorded for these COPs, to evaluate the extent of possible carbonization occurred during sulfonation.From the data as shown in Table S2, the elemental content of four kinds of COPs differs from each other and from that of calculated value, which is often observed for organic polymer probably due to the complicated polymerization processes and the products.Notably, no remarkable increasing of C content and decreasing of H content was observed upon sulfonation, indicating that the carbonization caused by sulfonation is negligible.The sulfonation of organic polymers was also investigated in some reported studies, 36,53 in which no notable carbonization was observed. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was also measured to analyse the surface electronic structure.Comparison of the spectra of four COPs was shown in Figure S3, the peaks assignable to C, N, O, Cl were observed for COP-P and h-COP-P.The observed Cl2p signal around 198 eV was ascribed to the residual Cl element derived from AlCl3, which is hard to be eliminated completely through simple washing.For s-COP-P and sh-COP-P, both the spectra possess an obvious peaks assignable to S and much enhanced O peaks.Take sh-COP-P as example (Figure 1), the bonding energies of C1s at 284.8, 286.3 and 288.7 eV should be assigned to C(sp 2 )C(sp 2 ), C-N, and OC-O, respectively (see Figure 1c).For the non-sulfonated COP-Ps, The N1s could be deconvoluted into two sub-peaks at 398.1 and 400.3 eV, corresponding to non-protonated and protonated pyrrolic N, respectively. 54In the case of sulfonated COP-Ps, only one peak at 400.3 eV was observed for the four protonated pyrrolic N (Figure 1d), caused probably by the migration of the proton of sulfonic acid group. 16,36The S1s peak (Figure .1e) locating at 168.57eV corresponds to -SO3 -group.The O1s peak(Fig.1f) can Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins be deconvoluted into two peaks with binding energies at 532.8 and 531.6eV, respectively, assignable to SO3 -and adsorbed CO2. 36milar assignment were made for COP-P (Figure S4), h-COP-P (Figure S5) and s-COP-P (Figure S6). The photoreduction of CO2 requires that catalysts have proper electronic energy structure.That is, the catalysts should have a more negative conduction band minimum (CBM) potential than CO2 reduction (for instance, CO/CO2, theoretically -0.52 V vs NHE), and a more positive valence band maximum (VBM) potential than the oxidation potential of sacrifice agent (for example, O2/H2O, theoretically 0.82 V vs NHE). 555665758 Here, Mott-Schottky measurements were first carried out to determine the conduction band edges of COPs.As illustrated in Figure 2a, Figure S7, S8 and S9, the C -2 vs potential plots of four COPs were recorded at 100, 500, and 1000 Hz, respectively.All curves show positive slope, unveiling the n-type semiconductors nature of them.The flat band potential derived through the intersection point of fitting straight line with x axis is very close to the bottom of the conduction band of n-type semiconductor, 16,35 which was -0.80,-0.97,-0.96 and -0.67 V ( vs NHE), respectively, for COP-P, h-COP-P, s-COP-P and sh-COP-P.The UV-Vis diffuse reflection absorption spectra were usually utilized to predict the band gap of the catalyst.Notably, all four COPs are black colour and exhibit a broad light absorption extending from UV to near infrared region (Fig 2b), owing probably to the electronic orbits coupling of porphyrin units.The corresponding Tauc-plot were deduced as (Ah) 2 vs Energy (in eV) plots were shown in Fig 2c .The obtained band gap is about 1.80 eV for all four COPs, which is slightly larger than other reported porphyrin polymers. 28According to these experimental data, the VBs and CBs of all COPs were predicted and depicted together in Fig 2d (detailed data see Table s3).It is indicated that all four COPs have a more negative CB than the reduction potential of CO2 to most investigated products, including CO, CH4, CH3OH, CH2O, and HCOOH. 555665758 They also possess a more positive VB than the oxidation potential of H2O to O2.Taken together, the band structure of the four polymers qualified theoretically them to be photocatalysts for the reduction of CO2 with H2O as sacrificing reagent. Inspired by above analysing result of electronic structure of porphyrin polymers, we further explore their photocatalytic performance in reducing CO2, with a 300W Xe lamp as light source. To guarantee the accuracy, the photocatalytic experiment was carried out independently for three times under the same condition, and the averaged data were used to evaluate the photocatalytic ability for all catalysts.For comparison, the catalytic activity of TPBB monomer and commercial TiO2 (P25) were first measured (Figure S10 and Table S4).All of the production of CO, CH3OH and CH4 were undetectable for TPBB within 1 h.While for P25, the formation of CO and CH4 was observed with an output of 0.92 and 0.13 mol g -1 within 1 h, respectively.In the case of COP-P (Figure 3a), CO was produced with a yield of 1.23 mol g -1 within 1 h, which unveils the better photocatalytic activity of COP-P than P25 in reducing CO2 into CO.However, the performance of h-COP-P and s-COP-P is not encouraging, with a CO yield of 1.80 and 0.86 molg -1 , respectively.This indicates neither hollowlization nor sulfonation, when acting solely, can effectively improve the photocatalytic performance of porphyrin polymer.Interestingly, when hollowlization and sulfonation was introduced together as observed for sh-COP-P, significantly enhanced yield of CO, 7.54 molg -1 within 1 h, was obtained.It should be noted that the surface-active sites are easily occupied by the products or intermediate, resulting in the attenuation of the catalytic activity with time going on.Meanwhile, both the production of CH4 and CH3OH were no more than 0.05molg -1 within 1 h for all four COPs (see Fig S10 and Table S4), revealing the highly selective formation of CO (selectivity 96).Within 4 h, the output of CO increased continuously, and the averaged production rates were about 4.58, 1.92, 0.92, and 0.5 molg -1 h -1 for sh-COP-P, h-COP-P, COP-P and s-COP-P, respectively (Figure 3b). To identify the origins of CO, control experiments were repeated under Ar atmosphere, and the production of CO was undetectable.This manifests that CO was indeed originated from the reduction of CO2.In addition, the stabilities of COPs were also testified by XPS characterization after photocatalysis (Fig S11 -S14), which show similar pattern to that before photocatalysis, indicating unaltered surface electronic structure of COPs before and after reaction. To elucidate the different performance of these four COPs, further analyses were required.Considering the closely dependence of photocatalytic activity on the separation efficiency of photogenerated carries and their migration ability to the surface of catalyst, the photoelectrical properties were investigated for these polymer catalysts and compared with each other.First, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was recorded in the dark environment, to evaluate the migrate ability of photogenerated electron to surface reactive site. 9,35,50As shown in Fig 4a, the EIS show semicircle arc at high frequencies for all polymers, which may be used to evaluate electron-transfer resistance (Ret) across the electrode/electrolyte.It's clearly indicated that both hollowlization and sulfonation can moderately lower the resistance, due probably to the polar environment caused by sulfonation that favours the moving of electron or the short transfer path to the surface of hollow structure.Nevertheless, the difference in resistance is slight for h-COP-P, s-COP-P and sh-COP-P, and cannot account for their significantly different performance in photocatalytic reduction of CO2.The transient amperometric I-t curves under light irradiation could give a direct evaluation about the separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers, 35,50,585960 and were also recorded here.As shown in Figure 4b, quick response of photocurrent was observed to the turn-on and -off of irradiation light, indicating the high migrating speed of photogenerated carriers to the electrode under bias for all four COPs.Furthermore, the photocurrent exhibits good repeatability and the intensity approaches to a constant value after ten cycles, indicating the stable formation of photogenerated electrons and holes upon light irradiation after the initial activation.Detailedly comparing the I-t curves reveals that two sulfonated polymers, s-COP-P and sh-COP-P, display much enhanced photocurrent than the pristine polymer COP-P and h-COP-P, respectively, manifesting that sulfonation was an effective method to improve the separation efficiency of photogenerated electrons and holes.This may be ascribed to the polar environment induced by the substitution of sulfonic acid group.Meanwhile, the larger photocurrent of h-COP-P than that COP-P also verifies the positive effect of hollow structure on the separation of photogenerated carriers, as indicated in references. 50urprisingly, s-COP-P displays a photocurrent as high as that of sh-COP-P, which might be ascribed to the great influence of sulfonation that overwhelms that of hollowlization effect.However, this photocurrent performance is not consistent with the photocatalytic result.Particularly, s-COP-P exhibits the largest photocurrent but the poorest photocatalytic yield of CO.Further investigation should be made to interpret the performance of COPs in the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 It is worth noting that the photocatalytic reaction here was carried out in a heterogeneous system, and thereby, the photocatalytic efficiency depends not only on the electrical and photoelectrical properties of catalysts, but also on their adsorption ability toward CO2.It has been revealed in previous work that sulfonation would result in a much decreased surface area, and thereafter decrease the gas adsorption capacity. 5152253 The CO2 adsorption capacity was measured for these polymers.As shown in Figure S15, the postsulfonation results in a significantly reduced CO2 adsorption capacity of 12.8 cm 3 /g for s-COP-P relative to the 46.5 cm 3 /g of COP-P at 298 K and 1.1 atm.This would lead to a poor photocatalytic performance for s-COP-P.Meanwhile, a moderate CO2 adsorption capacity of 25.8 cm 3 /g was observed for sh-COP-P, owing to the hollow structure that possesses less dead volume than s-COP-P.Consequently, the much improved photoresponse ability combined with the moderate adsorption capacity of CO2 leads to a much improved photocatalytic performance of sh-COP-P as compared to the other three COPs in reducing CO2 Considering the dual impact of sulfonation, several sh-COP-P samples were synthesized under different sulfonation time and temperature.As shown in Fig S16 and Table S5, the sulphur content in sh-COP-P increases with the reaction time and temperature, indicating the enhancement of sulfonation degree.Meanwhile, an improved photocatalytic performance is observed for the reduction of CO2 into CO.The sample under sulfonation at 100 oC for 60 min performs best. At last, the possible intrinsic mechanism of photocatalysed CO2 reduction by polymers was proposed on the basis of energy band structure analyses.As shown in Figure 2d, upon light irradiation, the electrons are excited from the VB to the CB of polymers, leaving holes in the corresponding position of the VB.And then, the photogenerated carriers, including holes and electrons, migrate to the surface of polymers.The holes are captured by water molecules absorbed on the surface of the catalyst, oxidating H2O into O2 (0.82 V vs. NHE), while the electrons react with the adsorbed CO2 and reduce it into CO (-0.52 V, vs NHE)."}], "reaction medium": [{"llm generation": "Gas", "source": "At first, the reactor added with catalyst was continuously inflated with pure CO2 gas (99.999) at a flux of 10 mL min -1 for at least 40 min, to ensure utterly filling the reactor with CO2 gas.Then, 2 ml of deionized water was carefully injected into the reactor.", "context": "Materials: All starting materials, unless otherwise noted, were purchased commercially and were used as received without further purification.All chemical reagents used in the experiments are analytically pure and the water used is distilled water.The size of SiO2 nanoparticle temple is about 140 nm.
