The orbital composition DOS of the above samples demonstrates that in the first step of photocatalysis, E abs is controlled by the HOMO and LUMO on the linker as their pristine ones, which almost equals their band gap (vide post, Figure S26). 26,37Diffuse reflectance ultraviolet-visible-near- The band gap of each sample was estimated from the corresponding Tauc plot (Figure S14), with the resulting values listed in Figure 3c, and accompanied by the presence of -NH 2 and the shrunken ligand, band gaps show a decreasing trend and are determined to be 2.78, 2.22, 2.76, 2.12, 2.72, and 2.08 eV for UiO-68-NH 2 -BA, UiO-68-NH 2 -2ABA, UiO-67-NH 2 -BA, UiO-67-NH 2 -2ABA, UiO-66-NH 2 -BA, and UiO-66-NH 2 -2ABA, respectively.The above order proves that a systematic regulated E abs (band gap) can be achieved by altering either the amino group of the modulators or the length of the dicarboxylate ligands.The intrinsic characteristics of this series are all n-type semiconductors, as reflected by the Mott-Schottky measurements (Figure S15), 3839404142 as the flat-band potential is approximately close to the conduction band minimum. 4344445 The HOMO and LUMO potentials with respect to the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE), as shown in Figure 3c, for all the as-synthesized samples show that there is not much difference between the LUMO positions of the samples; however, they show quite different HOMO positions.Moreover, the LUMO positions of these samples are all more negative than the redox potential of CO 2 to CO (-0.53 V vs NHE), indicating the feasibility of their CO 2 photoreduction potency. 46477484950 Additionally, the smaller E abs requires less light energy to excite; hence, UiO-66-NH 2 -2ABA with its defects modified by two amino groups and the shortest ligand among the samples endows the best photoresponse compared to others under visible-light irradiation. In order to survey the separation and transformation behaviors of photoinduced electrons, photoelectrochemical measurements were conducted by means of time-resolved fluorescence decay spectroscopy, photoluminescence (PL) emission spectroscopy, transient photocurrent response measurement, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).Time-resolved fluorescence decay spectroscopy, whose results are shown in Figure 4a, is employed to examine the photoexcited carrier transfer dynamics of the six samples.The average lifetime exhibits a reducing trend, with the order of UiO-68-NH 2 -BA UiO-67-NH 2 -BA UiO-66-NH 2 -BA UiO-68-NH 2 -2ABA UiO-67-NH 2 -2ABA UiO-66-NH 2 -2ABA, demonstrating that the substantial contribution of the defects with amino-modified modulators and shortened ligands will inhibit the recombination of charge carriers, which is also corroborated by the weakening emission peaks in the PL emission spectra (Figure 4b).Upon light irradiation, the samples absorb light, and the electrons in the valence band are excited to the conduction band, generating a photocurrent under the electric field. 51Figure 4c shows that UiO-66-NH 2 -2ABA exhibits the strongest transient photocurrent response among the samples, and the highest current density achieved by UiO-66-NH 2 -2ABA is 4.86 times that of UiO-68-NH 2 -BA, indicating that the shortest ligand and amino-modified defects can enhance the efficiency of electron transfer.Moreover, the arc radius of UiO-66-NH 2 -2ABA is the smallest among the samples in the EIS Nyquist plots (Figure 4d), implying the best electrical conductivity capacity. 5253354 All the photoelectrochemical results indicate that the efficiency of the photogenerated charge separation and transformation are substantially increased by altering the defects and ligands, and UiO-66-NH 2 -2ABA has the highest efficiency among these samples, which can be considered as a desirable photocatalyst for CO 2 reduction. According to the above results, it is interesting to confirm whether the accelerated electrons could facilitate the photocatalytic performance.CO 2 photoreduction reactions were performed over the series of UiO-MOFs under visible-light irradiation in a solvent-free reaction route for 5 h.The sample (2 mg) was dispersed uniformly on the fiberglass ( 25 mm) along with TEOA as a sacrificial agent in the catalytic system, and the system is shown in Figure S16.Indeed, six samples exhibit distinct yields of CO photoconverted from CO 2 as CO is the only product in the gas phase monitored by a flame ionization detector in all runs (Figure S17), whereas there are no liquid product evolutions under observation (e.g., HCOOH and CH 3 OH), supported by the results of the 1 H NMR spectral measurement (Figure S18).In these samples with different modulators and ligands, UiO-66-NH 2 -2ABA, which possesses two amino groups in the modulator and the shortest linkers, exhibits superior photocatalytic activity, reaching the CO yield of 17.5 mol g -1 h -1 , which is 2.4 times that of UiO-68-NH 2 -BA, displaying the highest apparent quantum yields of the catalytic process at 700 nm, as evaluated by monochromatic wavelength-dependent irradiation (Figure S19). 55oreover, the effective photoelectron evolution rate of UiO-66-NH 2 -2ABA reaches 35 mol g -1 h -1 (Figure 5a), higher than that of other previously reported photocatalysts such as CdS-decorated UiO-66-NH 2 , MIL-MOFs, and some inorganic materials (Table S3). 25,36,56577585960616263 Meanwhile, the contributions of the individual components in achieving the catalytic activity of UiO-MOFs toward CO 2 photoreduction were assessed by various controlled experiments, verifying that the existence of the catalyst, TEOA, and light is crucial for achieving effective CO production.Further, the photostability of UiO-66-NH 2 -2ABA was evaluated by recycling experiments, as shown in Figure 5b, and the catalytic stability is still maintained even after multiple uninterrupted cycles, and the crystalline structure and morphology of UiO-66-NH 2 -2ABA are confirmed by PXRD and SEM images to have no noticeable alteration (Figure S20).In the catalytic process, TEOA undertakes the responsibility of the electron and proton donor, offering 2e -for the photoconversion of CO 2 to CO, and the degradation product is analyzed to be 2-(bis(2hydroxyethyl)amino)acetaldehyde (Figure S21). 64,65In order to uncover the definite carbon source of the reaction, a 13 C isotopic experiment was carried out using mass spectroscopy (MS) to test the generated gas product.A signal peak at m/z 29 is observed, which is ascribed to 13 CO, originating from the primary 13 CO 2 , demonstrating that CO 2 is indeed the carbon source of CO (Figure S22).In brief, the yields of production catalyzed by these samples follow the order of UiO-66-NH 2 -2ABA UiO-67-NH 2 -2ABA UiO-68-NH 2 -2ABA UiO-66-NH 2 -BA UiO-67-NH 2 -BA UiO-68-NH 2 -BA, unambiguously attesting that the photocatalytic activity changes with the type of modulators and the length of ligands as more amino groups in benzoate accompanied by shortened linkers are more beneficial for CO 2 photoreduction.Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) tests were carried out to interpret the process of photoreduction.UiO-68-NH 2 -BA and UiO-66-NH 2 -2ABA were studied upon irradiation for 10 min, and signals at g 2.021, 2.009, and 2.003 in the EPR spectra were observed, which originate from the reductive Zr 3 sites, 66,67 indicating that the conversion of Zr 4 to Zr 3 in the photocatalytic process is due to the ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) effect. 68The EPR signal of UiO-66-NH 2 -2ABA at 2.003 is stronger than that of UiO-68-NH 2 -BA (Figure 5c).The stronger intensity of the EPR signals implies a stronger LMCT effect with a faster speed of the photoinduced electron transfer, verifying that the reactions of CO 2 photoreduction occurring in the Zr 3 sites of UiO-66-NH 2 -2ABA are more advantageous than that in UiO-68-NH 2 -BA, corresponding to their capabilities of reducing CO 2 , which is confirmed by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) in a CO 2 -saturated 0.5 M KHCO 3 electrolyte (Figure 5d). In order to understand the impacts of amino-modified defects and the shortened ligands on the electronic structure of the framework, DFT and TDDFT calculations were carried out to study the lowest vertical electron excitation from occupied orbitals (HOMO) to the unoccupied orbitals (LUMO) using several models (Table S4, Figures 6a andS23-S25).The calculated E abs of the cluster models are listed in Table S5, showing the same trends as that of experimental E abs .For pristine UiO-66-NH 2 , UiO-67-NH 2 , and UiO-68-NH 2 models, the HOMO is mainly localized on the dicarboxylate ligand, while the LUMO is more delocalized to the whole cluster.Upon the introduction of modulator BA, the HOMO is changed little, so the HOMOs of UiO-68-NH 2 -BA, UiO-67-NH 2 -BA, and UiO-66-NH 2 -BA are almost the same as the HOMOs of their pristine models, which are mainly localized on their dicarboxylate ligands.Interestingly, introducing -NH 2 on BA to 2ABA, the HOMOs of UiO-68-NH 2 -2ABA, UiO-67-NH 2 -2ABA, and UiO-66-NH 2 -2ABA mainly localizes on the 2ABA ligand.Meanwhile, the LUMOs of the as-synthesized samples are almost unchanged compared to the LUMOs of their pristine models.Hence, the change in E abs is mainly due to the HOMO energy level of modulators; that is, the higher the conjugation degree of the ligand modulator is, the more the HOMO energy level increases, contributing to a smaller E abs . Simultaneously, with the shrinkable ligand length, the E abs of the two sets of models, UiO-68-NH 2 -BA, UiO-67-NH 2 -BA, and UiO-66-NH 2 -BA and UiO-68-NH 2 -2ABA, UiO-67-NH 2 -2ABA, and UiO-66-NH 2 -2ABA, both decreased with the decrease in the ligand length, corresponding to the same trends of pristine UiO-66-NH 2 , UiO-67-NH 2 , and UiO-68-NH 2 , respectively, demonstrating that the shrinking ligands can decrease E abs . The first vertical excited states of these cluster models were calculated using TDDFT.Table S6 lists the detailed information of the first vertical excited states.Almost all the lowest vertical excited states are contributed by the HOMO LUMO transition.Orbital composition analysis of these frontier orbitals shows that the ligand length and ligand modulators do not affect the metal node contributions.We also calculated the DOS of all the models (Figure S26).Since the photoreaction takes place at the metal center, energy is required to excite the electrons from the ligand to the metal node.As shown in Figure 6b, the energy difference between the ligands and metal of UiO-66-NH 2 -2ABA is much smaller than that of UiO-68-NH 2 -BA, confirming the different intensities of the experimental LMCT effect.A smaller E abs results in a stronger LMCT effect, which is beneficial for the photocatalytic reactions. Further, the energy of dicarboxylate ligands and modulators was calculated to illustrate the photocatalytic mechanism of UiO-68-NH 2 -BA and UiO-66-NH 2 -2ABA (Figure 6c and Table S7).The longest dicarboxylate ligand, ATDA, with an amino group in UiO-68-NH 2 -BA absorbs light and transfers excited photogenerated electrons from the HOMO to LUMO.Then, the electrons in the LUMO of ATDA directly move to the Zr-O cluster instead of to the higher LUMO of modulator BA in defects.Hence, BA-modified defects have no effect on the E abs of the above samples due to its high energy of the HOMO.Modulator 2ABA with two amino groups in UiO-66-NH 2 -2ABA is a light-absorbing component, where the excited photogenerated electrons in the LUMO of 2ABA can move to the lower energy of the LUMO of ATA, shifting to Zr 4 through the LMCT effect for the photoconversion of CO 2 .It forms a type-II tailored homojunction, accelerating the photoelectron transfer and separation and thus improving the photocatalytic efficiency."}]}}
