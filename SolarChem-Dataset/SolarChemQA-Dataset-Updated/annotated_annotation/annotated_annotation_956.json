(TC/PCN) composites were prepared via a facile electrostatic selfassembly method, in which the ANH x of PCN acted as linkers to bond with Ti 3 C 2 via ANH x -Ti chemical bonding.Such a tight interfacial interaction could promote the migration of photoinduced electrons from PCN to Ti 3 C 2 significantly.Meanwhile, Ti 3 C 2 was a promising co-catalyst due to its outstanding conductivity and even a small loading of Ti 3 C 2 can effectively improve the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance.Such enhanced performance was mainly attributed to the synergistic effects of the close interfacial interaction, Schottky junction and the remarkable conductivity of Ti 3 C 2 .Benefiting from advantages above, the separation and migration of carriers were promoted and the enhanced performance was also achieved.Compared with previous works 32,565758, this work further discussed the bonding with catalysts (ANH x ATi), which was verified by FTIR and XPS.It is excepted that this

Firstly, the MAX was etched by HF to remove the Al layer to obtain multilayer accordion-like nanostructure, which was further delaminated into few-layers or single layer by DMSO and ultra-sonication in DI water under N 2 atmosphere.Then, abundant terminate groups like -OH, -O, -F were exposed on Ti 3 C 2 , which made the surface of Ti 3 C 2 negatively charged (-16.4 mV as displayed in Fig. S2a).Meanwhile, the porous g-C 3 N 4 was obtained by the HCl-treatment of bulk g-C 3 N 4 , making PCN positively charged (10.1 mV in Fig. S2b).Hence, the electrostatic interaction process between Ti 3 C 2 and porous g-C 3 N 4 can be realized spontaneously, as pictured in Fig. S3. The crystal structure of as-prepared samples was thoroughly characterized by XRD.As shown in Fig. 1a, obvious peaks assigned to Ti 3 AlC 2 (JCPS PDF52-0975) were investigated.After HF etching, the most intense diffraction peak located at 39.0completely disappeared and the diffraction peaks of (0 0 2) and (0 0 4) exhibited shift to lower angles, which indicated the successful conversion from Ti 3 AlC 2 to Ti 3 C 2 and the introduction of surface terminations like AF, AOH and AO.In addition, most of peaks became weaker and broader than pure Ti 3 AlC 2 , which can be attributed to the thinner layer structure of Ti 3 C 2 26.As for PCN, two well-defined diffraction peaks were revealed as presented in Fig. 1b.Specially, the peak at 13.1corresponding to (1 0 0) of PCN presented the inter-layer structural packing and the peak at 27.5indexed to (0 0 2) diffraction planes was caused by the inter planar graphitic stacking of aromatic system 27.Compared with bulk g-C 3 N 4 in Fig. S4, the basic crystalline structure of PCN still remained but all peak intense weaken in some extent.For example, peak located at 13.1decreased, which was mainly attributed to the partial destruction of aromatic units 28.Moreover, the (0 0 2) peak at ca. 27.5in PCN showed a slight shift toward to low angle and the intensity was also decreased, suggesting that PCN indeed possessed loosely layer structure 29.In addition, a series XRD patterns of TC/PCN composites were also evaluated and no obvious diffraction peaks belonging to Ti 3 C 2 can be observed, which can be speculated that the introduction of Ti 3 C 2 had no effect on the crystal structure of PCN. SEM and HRTEM were implemented to clarify the microstructure morphology of Ti 3 AlC 2 , Ti 3 C 2 , PCN and TC/PCN-2.As presented in Fig. 2a, pure Ti 3 AlC 2 showed typical block structure, while etched Ti 3 C 2 exhibited multilayer accordion-like nanostructure in Fig. 2b, which proved the formation of Ti 3 C 2 intuitively and was in line with the results of XRD 22,30.This successful preparation can be further verified by the EDS of Ti 3 C 2 showed in Fig. S5, in which the elements of Ti, C, O and F can be all observed.Fig. 2c and 2d revealed a 2D ultrathin sheet-like morphology of Ti 3 C 2 after ultrasound peeling.Meanwhile, the black green colloid dispersion of Ti 3 C 2 NPs showed a typical Tyndall effect (inset of Fig. 2c), suggesting the formation of homogeneous Ti 3 C 2 NPs 31.Fig. 4f and S5 exhibited holey texture defects without thickly stacked structure corresponding to PCN.Such a 2D ultrathin structure could contribute to the increased specific surface areas for more exposed active sites and reduced the distance of photo-generated electrons migrating to the surface for inhibiting the recombination of carriers 13,24.After introducing Ti 3 C 2 into PCN via electrostatic attraction, the morphology of PCN was nearly unchanged and Ti 3 C 2 was anchored on the edges and pore edges of PCN intimately (Fig. 2g and2h).From Fig. 2i, it can be seen that no clearly lattice fringes can be investigated in PCN because of its low crystallinity, whereas Ti 3 C 2 showed obvious lattice fringes with width of 0.264 nm and 1.0 nm corresponding to the (0 110) and (0 0 2) crystal plane, which matched well with the result illustrated in Fig. 4e 32.Furthermore, the EDS elemental mapping in Fig. 2j revealed that the excellent attachment of Ti 3 C 2 on the PCN.These results above all affirmed the successful assemble of ultrathin 2D Ti 3 C 2 nanosheets and 2D porous g-C 3 N 4 for TC/PCN hybrid photocatalysts. The BET surface areas and corresponding pore size distributions were analyzed by N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms.As shown in Fig. S7a, both PCN and TC/PCN-2 exhibited typical type-IV isotherms with H3 type hysteresis loops at P/Po (0.6-1.0), indicating the presence of mesoporous structures 20,33.This result can be further verified by BJH distribution in Fig. S7b, in which the main pore size was 2-50 nm.In addition, compared with the surface areas of PCN (28.0 m 2 /g), TC/PCN-2 (31.5 m 2 /g) showed a slight increase.Given that larger area and richer pore structure were rendered to provider more active sites and improved adsorption of agent, photocatalytic CO 2 reduction might be further enhanced. The FTIR spectra with semi-quantitative method were performed to explore the chemical bonds and the functional group on surface.As presented in Fig. 3a, for g-C 3 N 4 and PCN, there was nearly no difference in characteristic peaks except for the peak located at 2172 cm A1 , corresponding to cyano group derived from the incompletely condensed PCN, which indicated the formation of porous structure assisted by acidification process in PCN and stronger separation and transferability can be obtained in terms of the high electron-withdrawing ability belonging to cyano group 34.Besides, the broad peaks between 3000 and 3500 cm A1 corresponding to the residual -NH x group and the H 2 O adsorbed.Several strong peaks located at 1200-1700 cm A1 can be ascribed to the typical skeletal stretching of CAN and CN heterocycles 35.In addition, peak at around 809 cm A1 was assigned to the breathing vibration of thiazine rings and peak at 892 cm A1 was attributed to the deformation of NAH.Interestingly, PCN with pore structure exhibited richer ANH x (3269 and 3167 cm A1 ) compared with g-C 3 N 4 , indicating that the edges of pore and edges in PCN possessed abundant ANH x after acid treatment.Such special phenomenon might originate from the emerge of surface C vacancies as previous literature reported, in which the terminal N atom formed by partial destruction of the ring structure could connect with H and then generate ANH x group after acid treatment 28,36.The intensity of peaks belonging to 892 and 809 cm A1 also showed significant increase for PCN.In contrast, the intensity was reduced after the introduction of Ti 3 C 2 in PCN, as shown in Fig. 3b, suggesting that chemical bonding, especially for ANH x , play an important role between Ti 3 C 2 and PCN.Hence, ANH x on the edges might act as a linker to attract Ti 3 C 2 in electrostatic assemble, in combination with analysis above.Besides, the FTIR spectra of all prepared samples were displayed in Fig. S8 and nearly no change can be observed in TC/PCN samples after the loading of Ti 3 C 2 . To further investigate the chemical composition and states of as-prepared photocatalysts, XPS measurement was determined.It can be seen from XPS survey spectrum in Fig. 4a that TC/PCN-2 showed the presence of C, O, N elements, while Ti and F corresponding to Ti 3 C 2 cannot be clearly observed because of its weak intense.As illustrated in Fig. 4b, the high-resolution N 1s spectrum was chosen to reveal the chemical environment of PCN and TC/ PCN-2 since the low content of Ti 3 C 2 in TC/PCN-2 (2) and N element was solely contained in PCN.The N 1s spectrum of PCN was deconvoluted into four peaks, in which 398.8, 399.8, 401.0 and 404.2 eV were assigned to CANC (triazine rings), NAC 3 (tertiary nitrogen), CANH x (positive charge location in heterocyclic amino groups) and charging effects or positive charge location in heterocycles, respectively 24.Compared to PCN, the binding energy of 398.9, 399.9 and 401.2 in TC/PCN-2 showed a positive shift, indicative of the low electron density of PCN in TC/PCN-2 samples and the strong interaction between PCN and Ti 3 C 2 .Simultaneously, we can see in Fig. S9a, peak located at 404.2 eV presented a significant decrease, suggesting that the chemical interaction mainly corresponded to CANHx sites 13, which was in line with the FTIR data.Notably, a now peak was appeared at 397.5 eV, which was assigned to the N-Ti interaction 37.In combination with the Lewis acid and base theory and the lone pair of electrons possessed by ANH x , it can be deduced that Ti 3 C 2 was anchored on PCN through Ti-NHx interaction as displayed in Fig. S9b.In addition, Fig. 4c displayed the O 1s spectra of PCN and TC/PCN-2.PCN presented O1s spectrum similar to TC/PCN-2 and the one peak at 532.4 eV in PCN was attributed to adsorbed H 2 O or CO 2 , which exhibited lower binding energy than that of TC/PCN-2.Besides, it was worth noting that the content of F decreased from Ti 3 C 2 (10.08) to TC/PCN-2 (1.06) in Table .S1 and it is reported that the AF terminations might be replaced by AO and AOH in the water environment, in which AOH terminations significantly contributed to CO 2 adsorption as a basic site and was favorable for Ti 3 C 2 to capture photo-generated electrons from PCN 38,39.Fig. 4d displayed the C 1s between PCN and TC/PCN-2.All the binding energies located in 284.8 eV were ascribed to CAC (adventitious carbon).For PCN, two peaks at 288.3 and 285.5 eV corresponding to NACN and CANH x were detected, which presented a negative shift compared to that in TC/PCN-2 40.A newly appearing peak of CAO (285.3 eV) in TC/ PCN-2 can be attributed to the AO/AOH attached to Ti 3 C 2 and it can be also observed that the intense of C-NH x of TC/PCN-2 was higher than that of PCN, suggesting that more ANH x was exposed on the surface of TC/PCN-2, then favored for the CO 2 adsorption.All changes above demonstrated that an intimate interaction proposed through NHx-Ti bond and the electrons migration which was from PCN to Ti 3 C 2 in TC/PCN-2 were achieved, such results could further boost the separation and transportation of carriers, thus improved the performance of this hybrid photocatalyst. The photocatalytic ability of PCN and TC/PCN composites was evaluated by CO 2 reduction into CH 4 under visible light (420 nm) with H 2 O as photo-induce holes' acceptor.Besides CH 4, few CO can be also detected.As displayed in Fig. 5a, except Ti 3 C 2 , all samples exhibited the production of CH 4 from CO 2 photoreduction.Pure PCN presented a limited photocatalytic activity of 0.07 lmolAh A1 Ag A1 catalyst, mainly due to the rapid recombination of electron-hole pairs.In contrast, the CH 4 evolution rate increased significantly after hybridization of PCN and Ti 3 C 2 , even when the addition of Ti 3 C 2 NPs (1 wt) was very small.In addition, it was worth noting that highest photocatalytic activity (0.99 lmolAh A1 Ag A1catalyst ) was achieved when the addition of Ti 3 C 2 was 2 wt, which was much higher than pristine PCN and some reported works that showed comparable or limited photocatalytic performance (Table S2).However, excessive loading of Ti 3 C 2 NPs led to low activity and such reduced activity might be ascribed to the light-shielding effect or the formation of new sites for electron-hole combination 41,42.Even so, the TC/PCN-5 still possessed better activity than pure PCN.Furthermore, controlled experiments were also conducted to validate the source of CH 4 product (Fig. S10) and the results suggested that nearly no CH 4 production could be detected in followed experiments: i. without photo-catalysts; ii. in dark; iii.substituting N 2 for CO 2 , indicating that CO 2 was indeed the only source of carbon and this system was trigged by photoexcitation. The stability experiment of TC/PCN-2 catalyst was also explored.As shown in Fig. 5b, the CH 4 evolution rate exhibited ignorable reduction after consecutive four cycle tests during reaction.The morphology of used TC/PCN-2 was observed in Fig. S11 and it can be found that TC/PCN-2 after reaction preserved its porous structure.In addition, the physicochemical properties of prepared samples after four times cycling were characterized by XRD (Fig. S12) and FTIR (Fig. S13) and no obvious changes can be observed, demonstrating that the pohotocatalysts are stable.Based all characterization above, the composites synthesized possessed robust stability and excellent reusability contributed to the further application in CO 2 reduction. The light absorption behavior of as-prepared samples was determined by the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS).From Fig. 6a, it can be seen that Ti 3 C 2 owned the broad absorption from 300 to 800 nm without obvious absorption edge, suggesting the metallic nature of Ti 3 C 2 43.As for PCN, it has the typical absorption region at around 450 nm based on previous literature 44.With the increased amount of Ti 3 C 2 , TC/PCN composites exhibited red shift compared with pristine PCN, indicating the greater adsorption of visible light, which might benefit to the enhanced activity.In addition, the light absorption in the region of 500-800 nm was significantly enhanced, further implying the successful combination of Ti 3 C 2 and PCN.Interestingly, although the enhanced light adsorption during this ranges had no ability to excite the carriers in PCN, local surface catalytic reaction can be improved based on the photothermal effect of Ti 3 C 2 , thereby accelerated photocatalytic reaction dynamics and improved the performance of photocatalysis 45,46. The band gap energies (E g ) of PCN could be estimated according to the formula ahm A (hm-Eg) n/2 , where a, h, m, E g, n represented the adsorption coefficient, Planks constant, the light frequency, a constant relative to the material, the band gap energy and a constant dependent on the type of the transition in a semiconductor 47.As dispayed in Fig. 7a, based on the DRS of PCN, the Eg of PCN was exmained at 2.9 ev.Furthermore, the band structures of PCN and TC/PCN-2 were investigated by Mott-Schottky.As shown in Fig. 7b, from the positive slope of MS curve, it can be concluded that PCN is a typical n-type semiconductor 48.The flat band potentials of PCN and TC/PCN-2 could be extracted from the x-axis intersection and were approximately A1.14 V and A1.07 V (vs.Ag/AgCl, PH 7), which were equivalent to A0.92 V and A0.85 V (vs.NHE, PH 7) according to the conversion formula of Ag/AgCl electrode potential normal and hydrogen electrode potential, where E (Ag/AgCl) A0.197(PH 7), as reported in previous work 21.Given that the Fermi level (E f ) is approximate to the flat-band potential, the Fermi level of PCN can be prescribed as A0.92 V (vs.NHE, PH 7) 49.Besides, the flat band potential is always more positive by about 0.1 V than the CB potential of n-type semiconductor 50.Hence, the CB of PCN and TC/PCN-2 could be determined as A1.02 V and A0.95 V (vs.NHE, PH 7), while the VB of PCN can be calculated as 1.88 V (vs.NHE, PH 7) according to the formula E vb E cb E g .It can been found, the CB of PCN was more negative than TC/PCN-2, indicating that the electron was transferred from PCN to TC/PCN-2, in line with the results of XPS.Moreover, the To further figure out the effect of efficient charge separation performance on the underlying mechanism, the electrochemical tests were conducted.As shown in Fig. 8a, Ti 3 C 2 exhibited smallest arc radius due to its excellent electronic conductivity 33.The TC/ PCN-2 presented smaller arc radius and slop than pristine PCN, which unveiled that the existence of Ti 3 C 2 favored the low resistance and such a high electron migration in TC/PCN-2 was mainly attributed to the interfacial chemical bond, which can effectively promote the interfacial separation and transportation of carriers.In addition, the photocurrent was also carried out to classify the charge efficiency with obvious light on and off cycle in Fig. 8b.Notably, Ti 3 C 2 showed negligible current intense, whereas TC/ PCN-2 displayed highest photocurrent, which was higher than PCN significantly.Those results were good agreement with the performance of photocatalysis, in which Ti 3 C 2 possessed no photoactivity and TC/PCN-2 owned the best one.From above, it can be clearly concluded that introducing co-catalyst Ti 3 C 2 into PCN can efficiently improve the transportation and separation of electronhole, thereby enhance the photo-activity. The hydrophilicity of samples was determined by the contact angle test, which was an intuitive method for the water (or water vapor)-participated reaction.In Fig. S14, the contact angle order of PCN and TC/PCN-2 were 36.56and30.35, respectively.Generally, the smaller the contact angle is, the better hydrophilicity the catalyst has 52.It was obvious that TC/PCN-2 exhibited smaller angle than PCN since many hydrophilic groups were existed on the surface of Ti 3 C 2 and it exhibited better photo-performance, indicating that a moderate hydrophilicity may contribute to the improved performance. In addition, in-situ FTIR was a powerful technology to explore CO 2 adsorption and reaction mechanism of photocatalytic performance over TC/PCN catalysts.Hence, different CO 2 adsorption behaviors with CO 2 gas bubbling through H 2 O for 15, 30 and 60 min were carried out before/after irradiation.As displayed in Fig. 9, peaks in the range of 1000-1800 cm A1 were recorded.When catalyst adsorbed CO 2 and H 2 O in dark (lines a-c), the characteristic peaks of b-CO 3 2A (1347 and 1589 cm A1 ), m-CO 3 2A (1375 and 1514 cm A1 ), HCO 3 -(1442 and 1690 cm A1 ), appeared 6,53.After irradiation, some new peaks corresponding to the reaction intermediates were investigated (lines d-f), like HCHO (1066 cm A1 and 1716 cm A1 ), CH 3 O -(1121 and 1428 cm A1 ) and HCOOH (1247 and 1791 cm A1 ), in which CH 3 O -and HCHO were beneficial to the production of CH 4 8,54.CH 4 was not observed in this experiment due to its nature of nonpolar.Furthermore, the peak intensity under light was much stronger than that in dark, which can also validate the excellent effect of Ti 3 C 2 , that was its remarkable CO 2 adsorption and activation ability.These results can be further verified by the in-situ FTIR spectra of PCN (Fig. S15a) and the results of CO 2 TPD (Fig. S16).Fig. 12a showed that the intensity of peaks in PCN after irradiation was similar with that in dark and only a new peak (HCOOH) can be observed, which was in line with its limited photocatalytic performance.CO 2 -TPD as shown in Fig. S16 exhibited that the peak at 136 C was attributed to the desorption of CO 2 adsorbed physically and TC/PCN-2 exhibited larger areas than PCN, indicating that the incorporation of Ti 3 C 2 indeed improve the CO 2 adsorption 38,55.Besides, the CO 2 adsorption behavior of Ti 3 C 2 displayed in Fig. S15b also presented good CO 2 adsorption ability and the intensity of peak before and after light was nearly no change due to the metallic nature of Ti 3 C 2 .Based on results discussed above, it can be deduced that CO 2 reduction went through a complicated and multi-step reaction process. Based all characterization mentioned above, a plausible mechanism on improved photocatalytic performance and possible channels of electrons transfer was proposed, as illustrated in Scheme 2. Under visible-light irradiation (420 nm), the electrons on PCN was excited and moved to CB of PCN, while the holes remained in VB of PCN possessed strong oxidation ability that can oxidize H 2 O into O 2 .Given the E f difference of PCN and Ti 3 C 2 , the electrons in CB of PCN migrated into Ti 3 C 2 .Moreover, the built-in electric field formed by Schottky junction at the interface and the interaction chemical bond via NH x -Ti between PCN and Ti 3 C 2 can synergistically facilitate the migration and separations of charge carriers.Finally, Ti 3 C 2 in this work can act as a ''electric sink\", which not only promoted the transportation, but obtained an electron-rich environment on the planar surface of Ti 3 C 2 , thereby favored the multi electron CO 2 reaction."}], "lamp": [{"llm generation": "Xenon (Xe arc lamp)", "source": "Finally, the suspension was irradiated with a 300 W Xe arc lamp with 420 nm cut-off filter at 60C under stirring.", "context": "Ti 3 AlC 2 (99.7) was provided by Nanjing Mission New Materials Co., Ltd.Hydrochloric acid (HCl.AR) was purchased from Beijing Chemical Works.urea (AR), was obtained from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd.Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO.AR) was purchased from Guangdong Chemical Reagent Engineering Rapid Research and Development Center.hydrofluoric acid (HF.AR) was obtained from Aladdin.All chemical reagents were used as received without further purification.The water used in all experiments was purified through a Millipore system.
