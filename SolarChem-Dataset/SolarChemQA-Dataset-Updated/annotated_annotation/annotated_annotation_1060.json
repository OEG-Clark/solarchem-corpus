Fig. 2 shows the nitrogen sorption/desorption isotherms and pore size distribution curves for the commercial TiO 2 and the prepared hierarchically porous TiO 2 and Ag/TiO 2 , and the corresponding pore structure parameters are listed in Table 1.It is found that the commercial TiO 2 shows type I isotherm while the prepared hierarchically porous TiO 2 and Ag/TiO 2 exhibit type IV isotherm (Fig. 2a), indicating the presence of mesoporous structure of the prepared samples, which may be originated from the role of organic surfactant.Compared with commercial TiO 2 , the prepared sample TiO 2 shows a higher BET surface area (48 m 2 g -1 ) and a larger pore volume (0.43 cm 3 g -1 ) due to the presence of mesopore structure.After modified by Ag species, the obtained sample Ag/TiO 2 shows higher BET surface area (68 m 2 g -1 ) and relative lower pore volume (0.33 cm 3 g -1 ) than TiO 2 , which is attributed to the deposition of smaller Ag quantum dots.Fig. 2b shows the pore size distribution curves of the samples, it is observed that the prepared sample TiO 2 exhibits wide mesopore size of 20-200 nm, while the sample Ag/TiO 2 shows a relative narrow mesopore size of 15-50 nm, indicating that Ag quantum dots can enter into the mesopore channels.The larger BET surface area of the sample Ag/TiO 2 is beneficial for the dispersion of active species, thus more active sites can be exposed for the CO 2 adsorption and reduction.Besides, the typical hierarchically porous structure of the sample Ag/TiO 2 , especially larger mesopores, will greatly accelerate the diffusion and transport of reactants and products, which is conductive to photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 . The morphologies of the sample Ag/TiO 2 were investigated by SEM and TEM, as shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. S1.It can be seen that the size of TiO 2 is about 20-50 nm, and TEM, bright field (BF) and dark field (DF) images clearly indicate the presence of hierarchically porous structure.Besides, no larger Ag nanoclusters can be observed on the sample Ag/ TiO 2 , indicating that the Ag species can be highly dispersed on the TiO 2 crystal faces (yellow circles in Fig. 3d).Moreover, the Ag particle size is smaller than 3 nm, which is in the range of quantum dots level 13.Additionally, the BF image and the corresponding elemental signal (Fig. 4) of the sample Ag/TiO 2 as well as the energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) information (Fig. S2 from the selected area (yellow box in Fig. 3c)) also further confirm the presence of Ag elements.Fig. 3e-f show that the measured lattice space is about 0.354 nm, which is matched well with the (1 0 1) planes of anatase TiO 2 , indicating that the highly exposed face of anatase TiO 2 in this work is 1 0 1 crystal face.For the anatase TiO 2 , the theoretical calculations and experimental results have proved that the reduction sites are on the 1 0 1 planes 22.Therefore, the highly exposed 1 0 1 crystal face of TiO 2 is very beneficial to the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction. The surface composition and chemical states of the hierarchically porous TiO 2 and Ag/TiO 2 have been investigated, as shown in Fig. 5.The survey XPS spectrum shows the existence of Ti, O and Ag for the sample Ag/TiO 2 (Fig. 5a).The fine Ti 2p spectra (Fig. 5b) of the hierarchically porous TiO 2 and Ag/TiO 2 reveal two major peaks at the binding energy of 458.5-459.1 (2p 3/2 ) and 464.2-464.8eV (2p 1/2 ), which are lower than conventional TiO 2 (459.4 and 464.7 eV) 23,24, indicating that there are low valance Ti 25.The deconvoluted Ti 2p XPS spectrum for both samples shows four different peaks.The peaks at binding energies of 458.9 and 464.6 eV, 459.1 and 464.8 eV belong to Ti 4 26, respectively, while the peaks at 458.5 and 464.2 eV, 458.7 and 464.4 eV belong to Ti 3 24.The O 1s XPS spectra (Fig. 5c) of both samples can be resolved into two peaks, and the peaks at 530 and 530.2 eV are related to lattice oxygen while the peaks at 531.6 and 531.8 eV are ascribed to oxygen vacancies 272829.It is found that the binding energies of Ti and O shift toward higher value after modifying Ag, indicating that there are electron transfer between Ag and TiO 2 .The existence of low valance Ti species and oxygen vacancy defects may originate from the local reduction environment created by the organic surfactant during the calcination process.Part of Ti 3 substituting Ti 4 will produce vacancies simultaneously as the following formula. Besides, part of Ti 4 could be reduced by photogenerated electrons, The pore structure parameters and Ag content of the synthesized samples commercial TiO 2 , TiO 2 and Ag/TiO 2 . V total cm leading to the generation of the Ti 3 species and oxygen vacancies.It is reported that the oxygen vacancies of the sample are not only helpful to light harvesting and the separation of photogenerated charges, but also act as active sites for the CO 2 adsorption 30.The high resolution XPS spectrum of the Ag 3d for the sample Ag/TiO 2 is shown in Fig. 5d, and two distinct peaks at 368.4 eV and 374.4 eV can be related to the characteristic orbital splitting of the Ag 3d 5/2 and Ag 3d 3/2 , respectively, which are features of metal Ag 15,31. We further analyzed the optical properties of the commercial TiO 2 and the prepared hierarchically porous TiO 2 and Ag/TiO 2 via UV-vis spectroscopy, as shown in Fig. 6a.It is found that the absorption band edge of the commercial TiO 2 is about 400 nm, and a weak tail extending to 460 nm is observed on the prepared hierarchically porous TiO 2 , suggestive of the existence of defects.More importantly, the sample Ag/ TiO 2 exhibits broad absorption in the visible region due to the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect of Ag quantum dot, further confirming the presence of Ag in the sample Ag/TiO 2 .repeatedly to further evaluate the separation efficiency of photogenerated charges, as shown in Fig. 6c.Commercial TiO 2 shows a weak photocurrent response while the prepared samples, especially Ag/TiO 2 , show significantly enhanced photocurrent density and photocurrent response, further suggesting that the effective separation rate of photogenerated charges on the sample Ag/TiO , which can lead to more available electrons generated from the sample Ag/TiO 2 . The adsorption of CO 2 on the catalysts is the first step in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction, thus the temperature programmed desorption of CO 2 (CO 2 -TPD) of the samples have been investigated, as shown in Fig. 7a.Compared with commercial TiO 2 , the prepared hierarchically porous TiO 2 and Ag/TiO 2 show super CO 2 adsorption capacity due to the construction of defects and typical hierarchically porous structure.Especially, the sample Ag/TiO 2 exhibits significantly improved CO 2 adsorption performance, which can be resulted from its high BET surface area, rich oxygen vacancies and the synergetic effect between Ag quantum dots and TiO 2 .We conducted FTIR measurement to further explore the CO 2 adsorption performance on the sample Ag/ TiO 2 , as shown in Fig. S3.When CO 2 and water vapor are introduced into the reactor for 30 min in the dark, there are two peaks at 1640 cm -1 and 1392 cm -1 can be detected, corresponding to the monodentate and bidentate bicarbonate species 3233.It hints that the CO 2 molecules can be adsorbed on the catalyst.Under the photoirradiation, the intensities of these peaks assigned to monodentate and bidentate bicarbonate species increase, which may be related to the large thermodynamic tendency for the conversion of CO 2 -CO 3 2- 32. The photocatalytic activities of CO 2 reduction over all samples under UV-vis light irradiation are shown in Fig. 7b-c.During the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 , only gas CO as reduction product can be detected on the samples, while H 2 as byproducts can be not observe.It may be because the catalyst provides a driving force that overcomes the energy barrier of CO 2 reduction to rather than the H 2 evolution, similar to previous report 34.Besides, no products have been detected before photocatalytic reaction, hinting that the product CO is derived from CO 2 photoreduction.To further illustrate the origin of CO, carbon isotope analysis ( 13 C) has been performed via mass spectra, and the result is shown in Fig. S4.There is 13 CO detected in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 , further implying that the product CO is from CO 2 .As displayed in Fig. 7b, the stable CO yield with the time can be achieved on the prepared hierarchically porous TiO 2 and Ag/TiO 2 , and the CO yield on the sample Ag/TiO 2 (2.3 mol g -1 ) is about 1.5 times higher than that on pure TiO 2 (1.5 mol g -1 ) after 4 h UV-vis light irradiation, which is also higher than the TiO 2 /AC-Ag ternary composite (1.5445 mol g -1 in 4 h) reported in the literature 35.However, the commercial TiO 2 with low BET surface area (8 m 2 g -1 ) has not almost photocatalytic activity toward CO 2 reduction.Besides, the reference P25 TiO 2 with higher BET surface area (58 m 2 g -1 ) also shows relative weak activity to CO 2 reduction, as shown in Figs.S5-S6.In order to prove the contribution of defects in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 , the defective P25 has been prepared and the catalytic activity has shown in the Fig. S6.It can been seen that the yield of CO on the defective P25 is up to 1.1 mol g -1 in 4 h, which is higher than that on the conventional P25.These results suggest that the intrinsic defects (i.e., low valance Ti species, oxygen vacancies) in TiO 2 can also act as active sites and accelerate the adsorption and activation of CO 2 , improving the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity.Especially, the sample Ag/TiO 2 exhibits better photocatalytic activity than TiO 2 , indicating that the synergetic effect between Ag and TiO 2 can further promote the reduction of CO 2 .Further, the long-term stability of the sample Ag/TiO 2 is also tested, and it is found that the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity nearly remains after five cycles under UV-vis light irradiation (Fig. 7c).Additionally, the Ag content in the used sample Ag/TiO 2 is about 0.81 wt, which is very close to the Ag content in the fresh sample.This result suggests that the Ag leaching from the catalyst in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction is almost negligible, which is also the reason for the excellent stability and activity of the catalyst.The excellent recyclability and stability will be of great interest for achieving high-efficiency CO 2 reduction. Based on the above results and discussions, we propose a possible mechanism of the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction on the sample Ag/TiO 2 .The photocatalytic mechanism and the charge transfer for the Ag/TiO 2 are schematically illustrated in Fig. 7d.Under light irradiation, the reduction of CO 2 on the sample Ag/TiO 2 can be implemented via three routes.Firstly, the electrons and holes are generated on the semiconductor TiO 2 .Then, the excited electrons can transfer to the defect sites (Ti 3 -Vo) and further reduce CO 2 to CO (route i), similar to previous report 36.Therefore, the pure hierarchically porous TiO 2 with rich defect sites shows good photocatalytic activity in the CO 2 reduction (Fig. 7b).Secondly, the modification of Ag quantum dots on the support TiO 2 also further improve the photocatalytic activity, as shown in Fig. 7b.It is because Ag as cocatalyst can rapidly capture photogenerated electrons from the TiO 2 and accelerate the separation efficiency of photogenerated charges.Finally, the captured electrons on the Ag quantum dots would react with the adsorbed CO 2 molecules to produce CO (route ii).In the photoreduction of CO 2 , the presence of Ag quantum dots not only improves the visible light absorption performance (Fig. 6a), but also promotes the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes (Fig. 6b).More importantly, more hot electrons are also generated on metal Ag due to SPR effect (route iii), the produced hot plasmonic electrons can further transfer to the TiO 2 nanoparticles or adjacent metal Ag and reduce CO 2 to CO.Therefore, the sample Ag/TiO 2 shows better performance in the CO 2 reduction compared with the sample TiO 2 , which can be ascribed to the synergetic effects between Ag and TiO 2 .Meanwhile, the photo-induced holes on the TiO 2 would oxidize H 2 O into OH."}, {"llm generation": "P25 TiO2", "source": "Besides, the reference P25 TiO 2 with higher BET surface area (58 m 2 g -1 ) also shows relative weak activity to CO 2 reduction, as shown in Figs.S5-S6.", "context": "The crystalline structure of the samples was characterized via powder XRD patterns, as shown in Fig. 1.It is found that either commercial TiO 2 or as-prepared TiO 2 and Ag/TiO 2 samples show typical diffraction peaks corresponding to anatase TiO 2 structure (PDF21-1272).Among them, three typical diffraction peaks at around 25.28 , 37.80 and 48.04 are assigned to (1 0 1), (0 0 4) and (2 0 0) planes of TiO 2 .Additionally, no diffraction peaks assigned to metal Ag or Ag ions is observed on the sample Ag/TiO 2 , which can be related to the highly dispersed, smaller and low content of Ag nanoparticles.

The photocatalytic activities of CO 2 reduction over all samples under UV-vis light irradiation are shown in Fig. 7b-c.During the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 , only gas CO as reduction product can be detected on the samples, while H 2 as byproducts can be not observe.It may be because the catalyst provides a driving force that overcomes the energy barrier of CO 2 reduction to rather than the H 2 evolution, similar to previous report 34.Besides, no products have been detected before photocatalytic reaction, hinting that the product CO is derived from CO 2 photoreduction.To further illustrate the origin of CO, carbon isotope analysis ( 13 C) has been performed via mass spectra, and the result is shown in Fig. S4.There is 13 CO detected in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 , further implying that the product CO is from CO 2 .As displayed in Fig. 7b, the stable CO yield with the time can be achieved on the prepared hierarchically porous TiO 2 and Ag/TiO 2 , and the CO yield on the sample Ag/TiO 2 (2.3 mol g -1 ) is about 1.5 times higher than that on pure TiO 2 (1.5 mol g -1 ) after 4 h UV-vis light irradiation, which is also higher than the TiO 2 /AC-Ag ternary composite (1.5445 mol g -1 in 4 h) reported in the literature 35.However, the commercial TiO 2 with low BET surface area (8 m 2 g -1 ) has not almost photocatalytic activity toward CO 2 reduction.Besides, the reference P25 TiO 2 with higher BET surface area (58 m 2 g -1 ) also shows relative weak activity to CO 2 reduction, as shown in Figs.S5-S6.In order to prove the contribution of defects in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 , the defective P25 has been prepared and the catalytic activity has shown in the Fig. S6.It can been seen that the yield of CO on the defective P25 is up to 1.1 mol g -1 in 4 h, which is higher than that on the conventional P25.These results suggest that the intrinsic defects (i.e., low valance Ti species, oxygen vacancies) in TiO 2 can also act as active sites and accelerate the adsorption and activation of CO 2 , improving the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity.Especially, the sample Ag/TiO 2 exhibits better photocatalytic activity than TiO 2 , indicating that the synergetic effect between Ag and TiO 2 can further promote the reduction of CO 2 .Further, the long-term stability of the sample Ag/TiO 2 is also tested, and it is found that the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity nearly remains after five cycles under UV-vis light irradiation (Fig. 7c).Additionally, the Ag content in the used sample Ag/TiO 2 is about 0.81 wt, which is very close to the Ag content in the fresh sample.This result suggests that the Ag leaching from the catalyst in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction is almost negligible, which is also the reason for the excellent stability and activity of the catalyst.The excellent recyclability and stability will be of great interest for achieving high-efficiency CO 2 reduction. Based on the above results and discussions, we propose a possible mechanism of the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction on the sample Ag/TiO 2 .The photocatalytic mechanism and the charge transfer for the Ag/TiO 2 are schematically illustrated in Fig. 7d.Under light irradiation, the reduction of CO 2 on the sample Ag/TiO 2 can be implemented via three routes.Firstly, the electrons and holes are generated on the semiconductor TiO 2 .Then, the excited electrons can transfer to the defect sites (Ti 3 -Vo) and further reduce CO 2 to CO (route i), similar to previous report 36.Therefore, the pure hierarchically porous TiO 2 with rich defect sites shows good photocatalytic activity in the CO 2 reduction (Fig. 7b).Secondly, the modification of Ag quantum dots on the support TiO 2 also further improve the photocatalytic activity, as shown in Fig. 7b.It is because Ag as cocatalyst can rapidly capture photogenerated electrons from the TiO 2 and accelerate the separation efficiency of photogenerated charges.Finally, the captured electrons on the Ag quantum dots would react with the adsorbed CO 2 molecules to produce CO (route ii).In the photoreduction of CO 2 , the presence of Ag quantum dots not only improves the visible light absorption performance (Fig. 6a), but also promotes the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes (Fig. 6b).More importantly, more hot electrons are also generated on metal Ag due to SPR effect (route iii), the produced hot plasmonic electrons can further transfer to the TiO 2 nanoparticles or adjacent metal Ag and reduce CO 2 to CO.Therefore, the sample Ag/TiO 2 shows better performance in the CO 2 reduction compared with the sample TiO 2 , which can be ascribed to the synergetic effects between Ag and TiO 2 .Meanwhile, the photo-induced holes on the TiO 2 would oxidize H 2 O into OH."}, {"llm generation": "TiO 2 and Ag/TiO 2", "source": "As anticipated, the obtained samples TiO 2 and Ag/TiO 2 exhibit excellent and stable photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance compared to commercial TiO 2 .", "context": "The defective TiO 2 nanoparticles with hierarchically porous structure have been successfully prepared by a hydrothermal process assisted with organic surfactant, and Ag quantum dot as a cocatalyst have been uniformly stabilized on the surface of TiO 2 nanoparticles via in-situ photodeposition methods.As anticipated, the obtained samples TiO 2 and Ag/TiO 2 exhibit excellent and stable photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance compared to commercial TiO 2 .The super photocatalytic activity can be attributed to the design of hierarchically porous structure, the creature of defects and the modification of Ag quantum dots, which can significantly improve the CO 2 adsorption capacity and visible light absorption performance, and greatly accelerate the separation of photogenerated charges.Additionally, the synergetic effect between Ag and TiO 2 can further promote CO 2 adsorption and the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs via the Schootty barrier, which makes it own enhanced photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity.

Fig. 2 shows the nitrogen sorption/desorption isotherms and pore size distribution curves for the commercial TiO 2 and the prepared hierarchically porous TiO 2 and Ag/TiO 2 , and the corresponding pore structure parameters are listed in Table 1.It is found that the commercial TiO 2 shows type I isotherm while the prepared hierarchically porous TiO 2 and Ag/TiO 2 exhibit type IV isotherm (Fig. 2a), indicating the presence of mesoporous structure of the prepared samples, which may be originated from the role of organic surfactant.Compared with commercial TiO 2 , the prepared sample TiO 2 shows a higher BET surface area (48 m 2 g -1 ) and a larger pore volume (0.43 cm 3 g -1 ) due to the presence of mesopore structure.After modified by Ag species, the obtained sample Ag/TiO 2 shows higher BET surface area (68 m 2 g -1 ) and relative lower pore volume (0.33 cm 3 g -1 ) than TiO 2 , which is attributed to the deposition of smaller Ag quantum dots.Fig. 2b shows the pore size distribution curves of the samples, it is observed that the prepared sample TiO 2 exhibits wide mesopore size of 20-200 nm, while the sample Ag/TiO 2 shows a relative narrow mesopore size of 15-50 nm, indicating that Ag quantum dots can enter into the mesopore channels.The larger BET surface area of the sample Ag/TiO 2 is beneficial for the dispersion of active species, thus more active sites can be exposed for the CO 2 adsorption and reduction.Besides, the typical hierarchically porous structure of the sample Ag/TiO 2 , especially larger mesopores, will greatly accelerate the diffusion and transport of reactants and products, which is conductive to photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 . The morphologies of the sample Ag/TiO 2 were investigated by SEM and TEM, as shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. S1.It can be seen that the size of TiO 2 is about 20-50 nm, and TEM, bright field (BF) and dark field (DF) images clearly indicate the presence of hierarchically porous structure.Besides, no larger Ag nanoclusters can be observed on the sample Ag/ TiO 2 , indicating that the Ag species can be highly dispersed on the TiO 2 crystal faces (yellow circles in Fig. 3d).Moreover, the Ag particle size is smaller than 3 nm, which is in the range of quantum dots level 13.Additionally, the BF image and the corresponding elemental signal (Fig. 4) of the sample Ag/TiO 2 as well as the energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) information (Fig. S2 from the selected area (yellow box in Fig. 3c)) also further confirm the presence of Ag elements.Fig. 3e-f show that the measured lattice space is about 0.354 nm, which is matched well with the (1 0 1) planes of anatase TiO 2 , indicating that the highly exposed face of anatase TiO 2 in this work is 1 0 1 crystal face.For the anatase TiO 2 , the theoretical calculations and experimental results have proved that the reduction sites are on the 1 0 1 planes 22.Therefore, the highly exposed 1 0 1 crystal face of TiO 2 is very beneficial to the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction. The surface composition and chemical states of the hierarchically porous TiO 2 and Ag/TiO 2 have been investigated, as shown in Fig. 5.The survey XPS spectrum shows the existence of Ti, O and Ag for the sample Ag/TiO 2 (Fig. 5a).The fine Ti 2p spectra (Fig. 5b) of the hierarchically porous TiO 2 and Ag/TiO 2 reveal two major peaks at the binding energy of 458.5-459.1 (2p 3/2 ) and 464.2-464.8eV (2p 1/2 ), which are lower than conventional TiO 2 (459.4 and 464.7 eV) 23,24, indicating that there are low valance Ti 25.The deconvoluted Ti 2p XPS spectrum for both samples shows four different peaks.The peaks at binding energies of 458.9 and 464.6 eV, 459.1 and 464.8 eV belong to Ti 4 26, respectively, while the peaks at 458.5 and 464.2 eV, 458.7 and 464.4 eV belong to Ti 3 24.The O 1s XPS spectra (Fig. 5c) of both samples can be resolved into two peaks, and the peaks at 530 and 530.2 eV are related to lattice oxygen while the peaks at 531.6 and 531.8 eV are ascribed to oxygen vacancies 272829.It is found that the binding energies of Ti and O shift toward higher value after modifying Ag, indicating that there are electron transfer between Ag and TiO 2 .The existence of low valance Ti species and oxygen vacancy defects may originate from the local reduction environment created by the organic surfactant during the calcination process.Part of Ti 3 substituting Ti 4 will produce vacancies simultaneously as the following formula. Besides, part of Ti 4 could be reduced by photogenerated electrons, The pore structure parameters and Ag content of the synthesized samples commercial TiO 2 , TiO 2 and Ag/TiO 2 . V total cm leading to the generation of the Ti 3 species and oxygen vacancies.It is reported that the oxygen vacancies of the sample are not only helpful to light harvesting and the separation of photogenerated charges, but also act as active sites for the CO 2 adsorption 30.The high resolution XPS spectrum of the Ag 3d for the sample Ag/TiO 2 is shown in Fig. 5d, and two distinct peaks at 368.4 eV and 374.4 eV can be related to the characteristic orbital splitting of the Ag 3d 5/2 and Ag 3d 3/2 , respectively, which are features of metal Ag 15,31. We further analyzed the optical properties of the commercial TiO 2 and the prepared hierarchically porous TiO 2 and Ag/TiO 2 via UV-vis spectroscopy, as shown in Fig. 6a.It is found that the absorption band edge of the commercial TiO 2 is about 400 nm, and a weak tail extending to 460 nm is observed on the prepared hierarchically porous TiO 2 , suggestive of the existence of defects.More importantly, the sample Ag/ TiO 2 exhibits broad absorption in the visible region due to the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect of Ag quantum dot, further confirming the presence of Ag in the sample Ag/TiO 2 .repeatedly to further evaluate the separation efficiency of photogenerated charges, as shown in Fig. 6c.Commercial TiO 2 shows a weak photocurrent response while the prepared samples, especially Ag/TiO 2 , show significantly enhanced photocurrent density and photocurrent response, further suggesting that the effective separation rate of photogenerated charges on the sample Ag/TiO , which can lead to more available electrons generated from the sample Ag/TiO 2 . The adsorption of CO 2 on the catalysts is the first step in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction, thus the temperature programmed desorption of CO 2 (CO 2 -TPD) of the samples have been investigated, as shown in Fig. 7a.Compared with commercial TiO 2 , the prepared hierarchically porous TiO 2 and Ag/TiO 2 show super CO 2 adsorption capacity due to the construction of defects and typical hierarchically porous structure.Especially, the sample Ag/TiO 2 exhibits significantly improved CO 2 adsorption performance, which can be resulted from its high BET surface area, rich oxygen vacancies and the synergetic effect between Ag quantum dots and TiO 2 .We conducted FTIR measurement to further explore the CO 2 adsorption performance on the sample Ag/ TiO 2 , as shown in Fig. S3.When CO 2 and water vapor are introduced into the reactor for 30 min in the dark, there are two peaks at 1640 cm -1 and 1392 cm -1 can be detected, corresponding to the monodentate and bidentate bicarbonate species 3233.It hints that the CO 2 molecules can be adsorbed on the catalyst.Under the photoirradiation, the intensities of these peaks assigned to monodentate and bidentate bicarbonate species increase, which may be related to the large thermodynamic tendency for the conversion of CO 2 -CO 3 2- 32. The photocatalytic activities of CO 2 reduction over all samples under UV-vis light irradiation are shown in Fig. 7b-c.During the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 , only gas CO as reduction product can be detected on the samples, while H 2 as byproducts can be not observe.It may be because the catalyst provides a driving force that overcomes the energy barrier of CO 2 reduction to rather than the H 2 evolution, similar to previous report 34.Besides, no products have been detected before photocatalytic reaction, hinting that the product CO is derived from CO 2 photoreduction.To further illustrate the origin of CO, carbon isotope analysis ( 13 C) has been performed via mass spectra, and the result is shown in Fig. S4.There is 13 CO detected in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 , further implying that the product CO is from CO 2 .As displayed in Fig. 7b, the stable CO yield with the time can be achieved on the prepared hierarchically porous TiO 2 and Ag/TiO 2 , and the CO yield on the sample Ag/TiO 2 (2.3 mol g -1 ) is about 1.5 times higher than that on pure TiO 2 (1.5 mol g -1 ) after 4 h UV-vis light irradiation, which is also higher than the TiO 2 /AC-Ag ternary composite (1.5445 mol g -1 in 4 h) reported in the literature 35.However, the commercial TiO 2 with low BET surface area (8 m 2 g -1 ) has not almost photocatalytic activity toward CO 2 reduction.Besides, the reference P25 TiO 2 with higher BET surface area (58 m 2 g -1 ) also shows relative weak activity to CO 2 reduction, as shown in Figs.S5-S6.In order to prove the contribution of defects in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 , the defective P25 has been prepared and the catalytic activity has shown in the Fig. S6.It can been seen that the yield of CO on the defective P25 is up to 1.1 mol g -1 in 4 h, which is higher than that on the conventional P25.These results suggest that the intrinsic defects (i.e., low valance Ti species, oxygen vacancies) in TiO 2 can also act as active sites and accelerate the adsorption and activation of CO 2 , improving the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity.Especially, the sample Ag/TiO 2 exhibits better photocatalytic activity than TiO 2 , indicating that the synergetic effect between Ag and TiO 2 can further promote the reduction of CO 2 .Further, the long-term stability of the sample Ag/TiO 2 is also tested, and it is found that the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity nearly remains after five cycles under UV-vis light irradiation (Fig. 7c).Additionally, the Ag content in the used sample Ag/TiO 2 is about 0.81 wt, which is very close to the Ag content in the fresh sample.This result suggests that the Ag leaching from the catalyst in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction is almost negligible, which is also the reason for the excellent stability and activity of the catalyst.The excellent recyclability and stability will be of great interest for achieving high-efficiency CO 2 reduction. Based on the above results and discussions, we propose a possible mechanism of the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction on the sample Ag/TiO 2 .The photocatalytic mechanism and the charge transfer for the Ag/TiO 2 are schematically illustrated in Fig. 7d.Under light irradiation, the reduction of CO 2 on the sample Ag/TiO 2 can be implemented via three routes.Firstly, the electrons and holes are generated on the semiconductor TiO 2 .Then, the excited electrons can transfer to the defect sites (Ti 3 -Vo) and further reduce CO 2 to CO (route i), similar to previous report 36.Therefore, the pure hierarchically porous TiO 2 with rich defect sites shows good photocatalytic activity in the CO 2 reduction (Fig. 7b).Secondly, the modification of Ag quantum dots on the support TiO 2 also further improve the photocatalytic activity, as shown in Fig. 7b.It is because Ag as cocatalyst can rapidly capture photogenerated electrons from the TiO 2 and accelerate the separation efficiency of photogenerated charges.Finally, the captured electrons on the Ag quantum dots would react with the adsorbed CO 2 molecules to produce CO (route ii).In the photoreduction of CO 2 , the presence of Ag quantum dots not only improves the visible light absorption performance (Fig. 6a), but also promotes the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes (Fig. 6b).More importantly, more hot electrons are also generated on metal Ag due to SPR effect (route iii), the produced hot plasmonic electrons can further transfer to the TiO 2 nanoparticles or adjacent metal Ag and reduce CO 2 to CO.Therefore, the sample Ag/TiO 2 shows better performance in the CO 2 reduction compared with the sample TiO 2 , which can be ascribed to the synergetic effects between Ag and TiO 2 .Meanwhile, the photo-induced holes on the TiO 2 would oxidize H 2 O into OH."}, {"llm generation": "UV-vis", "source": "The photocatalytic activities of CO 2 reduction over all samples under UV-vis light irradiation are shown in Fig. 7b-c.", "context": "The crystalline structure of the samples was characterized via powder XRD patterns, as shown in Fig. 1.It is found that either commercial TiO 2 or as-prepared TiO 2 and Ag/TiO 2 samples show typical diffraction peaks corresponding to anatase TiO 2 structure (PDF21-1272).Among them, three typical diffraction peaks at around 25.28 , 37.80 and 48.04 are assigned to (1 0 1), (0 0 4) and (2 0 0) planes of TiO 2 .Additionally, no diffraction peaks assigned to metal Ag or Ag ions is observed on the sample Ag/TiO 2 , which can be related to the highly dispersed, smaller and low content of Ag nanoparticles. Fig. 2 shows the nitrogen sorption/desorption isotherms and pore size distribution curves for the commercial TiO 2 and the prepared hierarchically porous TiO 2 and Ag/TiO 2 , and the corresponding pore structure parameters are listed in Table 1.It is found that the commercial TiO 2 shows type I isotherm while the prepared hierarchically porous TiO 2 and Ag/TiO 2 exhibit type IV isotherm (Fig. 2a), indicating the presence of mesoporous structure of the prepared samples, which may be originated from the role of organic surfactant.Compared with commercial TiO 2 , the prepared sample TiO 2 shows a higher BET surface area (48 m 2 g -1 ) and a larger pore volume (0.43 cm 3 g -1 ) due to the presence of mesopore structure.After modified by Ag species, the obtained sample Ag/TiO 2 shows higher BET surface area (68 m 2 g -1 ) and relative lower pore volume (0.33 cm 3 g -1 ) than TiO 2 , which is attributed to the deposition of smaller Ag quantum dots.Fig. 2b shows the pore size distribution curves of the samples, it is observed that the prepared sample TiO 2 exhibits wide mesopore size of 20-200 nm, while the sample Ag/TiO 2 shows a relative narrow mesopore size of 15-50 nm, indicating that Ag quantum dots can enter into the mesopore channels.The larger BET surface area of the sample Ag/TiO 2 is beneficial for the dispersion of active species, thus more active sites can be exposed for the CO 2 adsorption and reduction.Besides, the typical hierarchically porous structure of the sample Ag/TiO 2 , especially larger mesopores, will greatly accelerate the diffusion and transport of reactants and products, which is conductive to photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 . The morphologies of the sample Ag/TiO 2 were investigated by SEM and TEM, as shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. S1.It can be seen that the size of TiO 2 is about 20-50 nm, and TEM, bright field (BF) and dark field (DF) images clearly indicate the presence of hierarchically porous structure.Besides, no larger Ag nanoclusters can be observed on the sample Ag/ TiO 2 , indicating that the Ag species can be highly dispersed on the TiO 2 crystal faces (yellow circles in Fig. 3d).Moreover, the Ag particle size is smaller than 3 nm, which is in the range of quantum dots level 13.Additionally, the BF image and the corresponding elemental signal (Fig. 4) of the sample Ag/TiO 2 as well as the energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) information (Fig. S2 from the selected area (yellow box in Fig. 3c)) also further confirm the presence of Ag elements.Fig. 3e-f show that the measured lattice space is about 0.354 nm, which is matched well with the (1 0 1) planes of anatase TiO 2 , indicating that the highly exposed face of anatase TiO 2 in this work is 1 0 1 crystal face.For the anatase TiO 2 , the theoretical calculations and experimental results have proved that the reduction sites are on the 1 0 1 planes 22.Therefore, the highly exposed 1 0 1 crystal face of TiO 2 is very beneficial to the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction. The surface composition and chemical states of the hierarchically porous TiO 2 and Ag/TiO 2 have been investigated, as shown in Fig. 5.The survey XPS spectrum shows the existence of Ti, O and Ag for the sample Ag/TiO 2 (Fig. 5a).The fine Ti 2p spectra (Fig. 5b) of the hierarchically porous TiO 2 and Ag/TiO 2 reveal two major peaks at the binding energy of 458.5-459.1 (2p 3/2 ) and 464.2-464.8eV (2p 1/2 ), which are lower than conventional TiO 2 (459.4 and 464.7 eV) 23,24, indicating that there are low valance Ti 25.The deconvoluted Ti 2p XPS spectrum for both samples shows four different peaks.The peaks at binding energies of 458.9 and 464.6 eV, 459.1 and 464.8 eV belong to Ti 4 26, respectively, while the peaks at 458.5 and 464.2 eV, 458.7 and 464.4 eV belong to Ti 3 24.The O 1s XPS spectra (Fig. 5c) of both samples can be resolved into two peaks, and the peaks at 530 and 530.2 eV are related to lattice oxygen while the peaks at 531.6 and 531.8 eV are ascribed to oxygen vacancies 272829.It is found that the binding energies of Ti and O shift toward higher value after modifying Ag, indicating that there are electron transfer between Ag and TiO 2 .The existence of low valance Ti species and oxygen vacancy defects may originate from the local reduction environment created by the organic surfactant during the calcination process.Part of Ti 3 substituting Ti 4 will produce vacancies simultaneously as the following formula. Besides, part of Ti 4 could be reduced by photogenerated electrons, The pore structure parameters and Ag content of the synthesized samples commercial TiO 2 , TiO 2 and Ag/TiO 2 . V total cm leading to the generation of the Ti 3 species and oxygen vacancies.It is reported that the oxygen vacancies of the sample are not only helpful to light harvesting and the separation of photogenerated charges, but also act as active sites for the CO 2 adsorption 30.The high resolution XPS spectrum of the Ag 3d for the sample Ag/TiO 2 is shown in Fig. 5d, and two distinct peaks at 368.4 eV and 374.4 eV can be related to the characteristic orbital splitting of the Ag 3d 5/2 and Ag 3d 3/2 , respectively, which are features of metal Ag 15,31. We further analyzed the optical properties of the commercial TiO 2 and the prepared hierarchically porous TiO 2 and Ag/TiO 2 via UV-vis spectroscopy, as shown in Fig. 6a.It is found that the absorption band edge of the commercial TiO 2 is about 400 nm, and a weak tail extending to 460 nm is observed on the prepared hierarchically porous TiO 2 , suggestive of the existence of defects.More importantly, the sample Ag/ TiO 2 exhibits broad absorption in the visible region due to the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect of Ag quantum dot, further confirming the presence of Ag in the sample Ag/TiO 2 .repeatedly to further evaluate the separation efficiency of photogenerated charges, as shown in Fig. 6c.Commercial TiO 2 shows a weak photocurrent response while the prepared samples, especially Ag/TiO 2 , show significantly enhanced photocurrent density and photocurrent response, further suggesting that the effective separation rate of photogenerated charges on the sample Ag/TiO , which can lead to more available electrons generated from the sample Ag/TiO 2 . The adsorption of CO 2 on the catalysts is the first step in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction, thus the temperature programmed desorption of CO 2 (CO 2 -TPD) of the samples have been investigated, as shown in Fig. 7a.Compared with commercial TiO 2 , the prepared hierarchically porous TiO 2 and Ag/TiO 2 show super CO 2 adsorption capacity due to the construction of defects and typical hierarchically porous structure.Especially, the sample Ag/TiO 2 exhibits significantly improved CO 2 adsorption performance, which can be resulted from its high BET surface area, rich oxygen vacancies and the synergetic effect between Ag quantum dots and TiO 2 .We conducted FTIR measurement to further explore the CO 2 adsorption performance on the sample Ag/ TiO 2 , as shown in Fig. S3.When CO 2 and water vapor are introduced into the reactor for 30 min in the dark, there are two peaks at 1640 cm -1 and 1392 cm -1 can be detected, corresponding to the monodentate and bidentate bicarbonate species 3233.It hints that the CO 2 molecules can be adsorbed on the catalyst.Under the photoirradiation, the intensities of these peaks assigned to monodentate and bidentate bicarbonate species increase, which may be related to the large thermodynamic tendency for the conversion of CO 2 -CO 3 2- 32. The photocatalytic activities of CO 2 reduction over all samples under UV-vis light irradiation are shown in Fig. 7b-c.During the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 , only gas CO as reduction product can be detected on the samples, while H 2 as byproducts can be not observe.It may be because the catalyst provides a driving force that overcomes the energy barrier of CO 2 reduction to rather than the H 2 evolution, similar to previous report 34.Besides, no products have been detected before photocatalytic reaction, hinting that the product CO is derived from CO 2 photoreduction.To further illustrate the origin of CO, carbon isotope analysis ( 13 C) has been performed via mass spectra, and the result is shown in Fig. S4.There is 13 CO detected in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 , further implying that the product CO is from CO 2 .As displayed in Fig. 7b, the stable CO yield with the time can be achieved on the prepared hierarchically porous TiO 2 and Ag/TiO 2 , and the CO yield on the sample Ag/TiO 2 (2.3 mol g -1 ) is about 1.5 times higher than that on pure TiO 2 (1.5 mol g -1 ) after 4 h UV-vis light irradiation, which is also higher than the TiO 2 /AC-Ag ternary composite (1.5445 mol g -1 in 4 h) reported in the literature 35.However, the commercial TiO 2 with low BET surface area (8 m 2 g -1 ) has not almost photocatalytic activity toward CO 2 reduction.Besides, the reference P25 TiO 2 with higher BET surface area (58 m 2 g -1 ) also shows relative weak activity to CO 2 reduction, as shown in Figs.S5-S6.In order to prove the contribution of defects in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 , the defective P25 has been prepared and the catalytic activity has shown in the Fig. S6.It can been seen that the yield of CO on the defective P25 is up to 1.1 mol g -1 in 4 h, which is higher than that on the conventional P25.These results suggest that the intrinsic defects (i.e., low valance Ti species, oxygen vacancies) in TiO 2 can also act as active sites and accelerate the adsorption and activation of CO 2 , improving the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity.Especially, the sample Ag/TiO 2 exhibits better photocatalytic activity than TiO 2 , indicating that the synergetic effect between Ag and TiO 2 can further promote the reduction of CO 2 .Further, the long-term stability of the sample Ag/TiO 2 is also tested, and it is found that the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity nearly remains after five cycles under UV-vis light irradiation (Fig. 7c).Additionally, the Ag content in the used sample Ag/TiO 2 is about 0.81 wt, which is very close to the Ag content in the fresh sample.This result suggests that the Ag leaching from the catalyst in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction is almost negligible, which is also the reason for the excellent stability and activity of the catalyst.The excellent recyclability and stability will be of great interest for achieving high-efficiency CO 2 reduction. Based on the above results and discussions, we propose a possible mechanism of the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction on the sample Ag/TiO 2 .The photocatalytic mechanism and the charge transfer for the Ag/TiO 2 are schematically illustrated in Fig. 7d.Under light irradiation, the reduction of CO 2 on the sample Ag/TiO 2 can be implemented via three routes.Firstly, the electrons and holes are generated on the semiconductor TiO 2 .Then, the excited electrons can transfer to the defect sites (Ti 3 -Vo) and further reduce CO 2 to CO (route i), similar to previous report 36.Therefore, the pure hierarchically porous TiO 2 with rich defect sites shows good photocatalytic activity in the CO 2 reduction (Fig. 7b).Secondly, the modification of Ag quantum dots on the support TiO 2 also further improve the photocatalytic activity, as shown in Fig. 7b.It is because Ag as cocatalyst can rapidly capture photogenerated electrons from the TiO 2 and accelerate the separation efficiency of photogenerated charges.Finally, the captured electrons on the Ag quantum dots would react with the adsorbed CO 2 molecules to produce CO (route ii).In the photoreduction of CO 2 , the presence of Ag quantum dots not only improves the visible light absorption performance (Fig. 6a), but also promotes the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes (Fig. 6b).More importantly, more hot electrons are also generated on metal Ag due to SPR effect (route iii), the produced hot plasmonic electrons can further transfer to the TiO 2 nanoparticles or adjacent metal Ag and reduce CO 2 to CO.Therefore, the sample Ag/TiO 2 shows better performance in the CO 2 reduction compared with the sample TiO 2 , which can be ascribed to the synergetic effects between Ag and TiO 2 .Meanwhile, the photo-induced holes on the TiO 2 would oxidize H 2 O into OH."}, {"llm generation": "UV-vis", "source": "As displayed in Fig. 7b, the stable CO yield with the time can be achieved on the prepared hierarchically porous TiO 2 and Ag/TiO 2 , and the CO yield on the sample Ag/TiO 2 (2.3 mol g -1 ) is about 1.5 times higher than that on pure TiO 2 (1.5 mol g -1 ) after 4 h UV-vis light irradiation, which is also higher than the TiO 2 /AC-Ag ternary composite (1.5445 mol g -1 in 4 h) reported in the literature 35.", "context": "The crystalline structure of the samples was characterized via powder XRD patterns, as shown in Fig. 1.It is found that either commercial TiO 2 or as-prepared TiO 2 and Ag/TiO 2 samples show typical diffraction peaks corresponding to anatase TiO 2 structure (PDF21-1272).Among them, three typical diffraction peaks at around 25.28 , 37.80 and 48.04 are assigned to (1 0 1), (0 0 4) and (2 0 0) planes of TiO 2 .Additionally, no diffraction peaks assigned to metal Ag or Ag ions is observed on the sample Ag/TiO 2 , which can be related to the highly dispersed, smaller and low content of Ag nanoparticles. Fig. 2 shows the nitrogen sorption/desorption isotherms and pore size distribution curves for the commercial TiO 2 and the prepared hierarchically porous TiO 2 and Ag/TiO 2 , and the corresponding pore structure parameters are listed in Table 1.It is found that the commercial TiO 2 shows type I isotherm while the prepared hierarchically porous TiO 2 and Ag/TiO 2 exhibit type IV isotherm (Fig. 2a), indicating the presence of mesoporous structure of the prepared samples, which may be originated from the role of organic surfactant.Compared with commercial TiO 2 , the prepared sample TiO 2 shows a higher BET surface area (48 m 2 g -1 ) and a larger pore volume (0.43 cm 3 g -1 ) due to the presence of mesopore structure.After modified by Ag species, the obtained sample Ag/TiO 2 shows higher BET surface area (68 m 2 g -1 ) and relative lower pore volume (0.33 cm 3 g -1 ) than TiO 2 , which is attributed to the deposition of smaller Ag quantum dots.Fig. 2b shows the pore size distribution curves of the samples, it is observed that the prepared sample TiO 2 exhibits wide mesopore size of 20-200 nm, while the sample Ag/TiO 2 shows a relative narrow mesopore size of 15-50 nm, indicating that Ag quantum dots can enter into the mesopore channels.The larger BET surface area of the sample Ag/TiO 2 is beneficial for the dispersion of active species, thus more active sites can be exposed for the CO 2 adsorption and reduction.Besides, the typical hierarchically porous structure of the sample Ag/TiO 2 , especially larger mesopores, will greatly accelerate the diffusion and transport of reactants and products, which is conductive to photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 . The morphologies of the sample Ag/TiO 2 were investigated by SEM and TEM, as shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. S1.It can be seen that the size of TiO 2 is about 20-50 nm, and TEM, bright field (BF) and dark field (DF) images clearly indicate the presence of hierarchically porous structure.Besides, no larger Ag nanoclusters can be observed on the sample Ag/ TiO 2 , indicating that the Ag species can be highly dispersed on the TiO 2 crystal faces (yellow circles in Fig. 3d).Moreover, the Ag particle size is smaller than 3 nm, which is in the range of quantum dots level 13.Additionally, the BF image and the corresponding elemental signal (Fig. 4) of the sample Ag/TiO 2 as well as the energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) information (Fig. S2 from the selected area (yellow box in Fig. 3c)) also further confirm the presence of Ag elements.Fig. 3e-f show that the measured lattice space is about 0.354 nm, which is matched well with the (1 0 1) planes of anatase TiO 2 , indicating that the highly exposed face of anatase TiO 2 in this work is 1 0 1 crystal face.For the anatase TiO 2 , the theoretical calculations and experimental results have proved that the reduction sites are on the 1 0 1 planes 22.Therefore, the highly exposed 1 0 1 crystal face of TiO 2 is very beneficial to the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction. The surface composition and chemical states of the hierarchically porous TiO 2 and Ag/TiO 2 have been investigated, as shown in Fig. 5.The survey XPS spectrum shows the existence of Ti, O and Ag for the sample Ag/TiO 2 (Fig. 5a).The fine Ti 2p spectra (Fig. 5b) of the hierarchically porous TiO 2 and Ag/TiO 2 reveal two major peaks at the binding energy of 458.5-459.1 (2p 3/2 ) and 464.2-464.8eV (2p 1/2 ), which are lower than conventional TiO 2 (459.4 and 464.7 eV) 23,24, indicating that there are low valance Ti 25.The deconvoluted Ti 2p XPS spectrum for both samples shows four different peaks.The peaks at binding energies of 458.9 and 464.6 eV, 459.1 and 464.8 eV belong to Ti 4 26, respectively, while the peaks at 458.5 and 464.2 eV, 458.7 and 464.4 eV belong to Ti 3 24.The O 1s XPS spectra (Fig. 5c) of both samples can be resolved into two peaks, and the peaks at 530 and 530.2 eV are related to lattice oxygen while the peaks at 531.6 and 531.8 eV are ascribed to oxygen vacancies 272829.It is found that the binding energies of Ti and O shift toward higher value after modifying Ag, indicating that there are electron transfer between Ag and TiO 2 .The existence of low valance Ti species and oxygen vacancy defects may originate from the local reduction environment created by the organic surfactant during the calcination process.Part of Ti 3 substituting Ti 4 will produce vacancies simultaneously as the following formula. Besides, part of Ti 4 could be reduced by photogenerated electrons, The pore structure parameters and Ag content of the synthesized samples commercial TiO 2 , TiO 2 and Ag/TiO 2 . V total cm leading to the generation of the Ti 3 species and oxygen vacancies.It is reported that the oxygen vacancies of the sample are not only helpful to light harvesting and the separation of photogenerated charges, but also act as active sites for the CO 2 adsorption 30.The high resolution XPS spectrum of the Ag 3d for the sample Ag/TiO 2 is shown in Fig. 5d, and two distinct peaks at 368.4 eV and 374.4 eV can be related to the characteristic orbital splitting of the Ag 3d 5/2 and Ag 3d 3/2 , respectively, which are features of metal Ag 15,31. We further analyzed the optical properties of the commercial TiO 2 and the prepared hierarchically porous TiO 2 and Ag/TiO 2 via UV-vis spectroscopy, as shown in Fig. 6a.It is found that the absorption band edge of the commercial TiO 2 is about 400 nm, and a weak tail extending to 460 nm is observed on the prepared hierarchically porous TiO 2 , suggestive of the existence of defects.More importantly, the sample Ag/ TiO 2 exhibits broad absorption in the visible region due to the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect of Ag quantum dot, further confirming the presence of Ag in the sample Ag/TiO 2 .repeatedly to further evaluate the separation efficiency of photogenerated charges, as shown in Fig. 6c.Commercial TiO 2 shows a weak photocurrent response while the prepared samples, especially Ag/TiO 2 , show significantly enhanced photocurrent density and photocurrent response, further suggesting that the effective separation rate of photogenerated charges on the sample Ag/TiO , which can lead to more available electrons generated from the sample Ag/TiO 2 . The adsorption of CO 2 on the catalysts is the first step in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction, thus the temperature programmed desorption of CO 2 (CO 2 -TPD) of the samples have been investigated, as shown in Fig. 7a.Compared with commercial TiO 2 , the prepared hierarchically porous TiO 2 and Ag/TiO 2 show super CO 2 adsorption capacity due to the construction of defects and typical hierarchically porous structure.Especially, the sample Ag/TiO 2 exhibits significantly improved CO 2 adsorption performance, which can be resulted from its high BET surface area, rich oxygen vacancies and the synergetic effect between Ag quantum dots and TiO 2 .We conducted FTIR measurement to further explore the CO 2 adsorption performance on the sample Ag/ TiO 2 , as shown in Fig. S3.When CO 2 and water vapor are introduced into the reactor for 30 min in the dark, there are two peaks at 1640 cm -1 and 1392 cm -1 can be detected, corresponding to the monodentate and bidentate bicarbonate species 3233.It hints that the CO 2 molecules can be adsorbed on the catalyst.Under the photoirradiation, the intensities of these peaks assigned to monodentate and bidentate bicarbonate species increase, which may be related to the large thermodynamic tendency for the conversion of CO 2 -CO 3 2- 32. The photocatalytic activities of CO 2 reduction over all samples under UV-vis light irradiation are shown in Fig. 7b-c.During the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 , only gas CO as reduction product can be detected on the samples, while H 2 as byproducts can be not observe.It may be because the catalyst provides a driving force that overcomes the energy barrier of CO 2 reduction to rather than the H 2 evolution, similar to previous report 34.Besides, no products have been detected before photocatalytic reaction, hinting that the product CO is derived from CO 2 photoreduction.To further illustrate the origin of CO, carbon isotope analysis ( 13 C) has been performed via mass spectra, and the result is shown in Fig. S4.There is 13 CO detected in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 , further implying that the product CO is from CO 2 .As displayed in Fig. 7b, the stable CO yield with the time can be achieved on the prepared hierarchically porous TiO 2 and Ag/TiO 2 , and the CO yield on the sample Ag/TiO 2 (2.3 mol g -1 ) is about 1.5 times higher than that on pure TiO 2 (1.5 mol g -1 ) after 4 h UV-vis light irradiation, which is also higher than the TiO 2 /AC-Ag ternary composite (1.5445 mol g -1 in 4 h) reported in the literature 35.However, the commercial TiO 2 with low BET surface area (8 m 2 g -1 ) has not almost photocatalytic activity toward CO 2 reduction.Besides, the reference P25 TiO 2 with higher BET surface area (58 m 2 g -1 ) also shows relative weak activity to CO 2 reduction, as shown in Figs.S5-S6.In order to prove the contribution of defects in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 , the defective P25 has been prepared and the catalytic activity has shown in the Fig. S6.It can been seen that the yield of CO on the defective P25 is up to 1.1 mol g -1 in 4 h, which is higher than that on the conventional P25.These results suggest that the intrinsic defects (i.e., low valance Ti species, oxygen vacancies) in TiO 2 can also act as active sites and accelerate the adsorption and activation of CO 2 , improving the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity.Especially, the sample Ag/TiO 2 exhibits better photocatalytic activity than TiO 2 , indicating that the synergetic effect between Ag and TiO 2 can further promote the reduction of CO 2 .Further, the long-term stability of the sample Ag/TiO 2 is also tested, and it is found that the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity nearly remains after five cycles under UV-vis light irradiation (Fig. 7c).Additionally, the Ag content in the used sample Ag/TiO 2 is about 0.81 wt, which is very close to the Ag content in the fresh sample.This result suggests that the Ag leaching from the catalyst in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction is almost negligible, which is also the reason for the excellent stability and activity of the catalyst.The excellent recyclability and stability will be of great interest for achieving high-efficiency CO 2 reduction. Based on the above results and discussions, we propose a possible mechanism of the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction on the sample Ag/TiO 2 .The photocatalytic mechanism and the charge transfer for the Ag/TiO 2 are schematically illustrated in Fig. 7d.Under light irradiation, the reduction of CO 2 on the sample Ag/TiO 2 can be implemented via three routes.Firstly, the electrons and holes are generated on the semiconductor TiO 2 .Then, the excited electrons can transfer to the defect sites (Ti 3 -Vo) and further reduce CO 2 to CO (route i), similar to previous report 36.Therefore, the pure hierarchically porous TiO 2 with rich defect sites shows good photocatalytic activity in the CO 2 reduction (Fig. 7b).Secondly, the modification of Ag quantum dots on the support TiO 2 also further improve the photocatalytic activity, as shown in Fig. 7b.It is because Ag as cocatalyst can rapidly capture photogenerated electrons from the TiO 2 and accelerate the separation efficiency of photogenerated charges.Finally, the captured electrons on the Ag quantum dots would react with the adsorbed CO 2 molecules to produce CO (route ii).In the photoreduction of CO 2 , the presence of Ag quantum dots not only improves the visible light absorption performance (Fig. 6a), but also promotes the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes (Fig. 6b).More importantly, more hot electrons are also generated on metal Ag due to SPR effect (route iii), the produced hot plasmonic electrons can further transfer to the TiO 2 nanoparticles or adjacent metal Ag and reduce CO 2 to CO.Therefore, the sample Ag/TiO 2 shows better performance in the CO 2 reduction compared with the sample TiO 2 , which can be ascribed to the synergetic effects between Ag and TiO 2 .Meanwhile, the photo-induced holes on the TiO 2 would oxidize H 2 O into OH."}, {"llm generation": "UV-vis", "source": "Further, the long-term stability of the sample Ag/TiO 2 is also tested, and it is found that the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity nearly remains after five cycles under UV-vis light irradiation (Fig. 7c).", "context": "The crystalline structure of the samples was characterized via powder XRD patterns, as shown in Fig. 1.It is found that either commercial TiO 2 or as-prepared TiO 2 and Ag/TiO 2 samples show typical diffraction peaks corresponding to anatase TiO 2 structure (PDF21-1272).Among them, three typical diffraction peaks at around 25.28 , 37.80 and 48.04 are assigned to (1 0 1), (0 0 4) and (2 0 0) planes of TiO 2 .Additionally, no diffraction peaks assigned to metal Ag or Ag ions is observed on the sample Ag/TiO 2 , which can be related to the highly dispersed, smaller and low content of Ag nanoparticles. Fig. 2 shows the nitrogen sorption/desorption isotherms and pore size distribution curves for the commercial TiO 2 and the prepared hierarchically porous TiO 2 and Ag/TiO 2 , and the corresponding pore structure parameters are listed in Table 1.It is found that the commercial TiO 2 shows type I isotherm while the prepared hierarchically porous TiO 2 and Ag/TiO 2 exhibit type IV isotherm (Fig. 2a), indicating the presence of mesoporous structure of the prepared samples, which may be originated from the role of organic surfactant.Compared with commercial TiO 2 , the prepared sample TiO 2 shows a higher BET surface area (48 m 2 g -1 ) and a larger pore volume (0.43 cm 3 g -1 ) due to the presence of mesopore structure.After modified by Ag species, the obtained sample Ag/TiO 2 shows higher BET surface area (68 m 2 g -1 ) and relative lower pore volume (0.33 cm 3 g -1 ) than TiO 2 , which is attributed to the deposition of smaller Ag quantum dots.Fig. 2b shows the pore size distribution curves of the samples, it is observed that the prepared sample TiO 2 exhibits wide mesopore size of 20-200 nm, while the sample Ag/TiO 2 shows a relative narrow mesopore size of 15-50 nm, indicating that Ag quantum dots can enter into the mesopore channels.The larger BET surface area of the sample Ag/TiO 2 is beneficial for the dispersion of active species, thus more active sites can be exposed for the CO 2 adsorption and reduction.Besides, the typical hierarchically porous structure of the sample Ag/TiO 2 , especially larger mesopores, will greatly accelerate the diffusion and transport of reactants and products, which is conductive to photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .

The surface composition and chemical states of the hierarchically porous TiO 2 and Ag/TiO 2 have been investigated, as shown in Fig. 5.The survey XPS spectrum shows the existence of Ti, O and Ag for the sample Ag/TiO 2 (Fig. 5a).The fine Ti 2p spectra (Fig. 5b) of the hierarchically porous TiO 2 and Ag/TiO 2 reveal two major peaks at the binding energy of 458.5-459.1 (2p 3/2 ) and 464.2-464.8eV (2p 1/2 ), which are lower than conventional TiO 2 (459.4 and 464.7 eV) 23,24, indicating that there are low valance Ti 25.The deconvoluted Ti 2p XPS spectrum for both samples shows four different peaks.The peaks at binding energies of 458.9 and 464.6 eV, 459.1 and 464.8 eV belong to Ti 4 26, respectively, while the peaks at 458.5 and 464.2 eV, 458.7 and 464.4 eV belong to Ti 3 24.The O 1s XPS spectra (Fig. 5c) of both samples can be resolved into two peaks, and the peaks at 530 and 530.2 eV are related to lattice oxygen while the peaks at 531.6 and 531.8 eV are ascribed to oxygen vacancies 272829.It is found that the binding energies of Ti and O shift toward higher value after modifying Ag, indicating that there are electron transfer between Ag and TiO 2 .The existence of low valance Ti species and oxygen vacancy defects may originate from the local reduction environment created by the organic surfactant during the calcination process.Part of Ti 3 substituting Ti 4 will produce vacancies simultaneously as the following formula. Besides, part of Ti 4 could be reduced by photogenerated electrons, The pore structure parameters and Ag content of the synthesized samples commercial TiO 2 , TiO 2 and Ag/TiO 2 . V total cm leading to the generation of the Ti 3 species and oxygen vacancies.It is reported that the oxygen vacancies of the sample are not only helpful to light harvesting and the separation of photogenerated charges, but also act as active sites for the CO 2 adsorption 30.The high resolution XPS spectrum of the Ag 3d for the sample Ag/TiO 2 is shown in Fig. 5d, and two distinct peaks at 368.4 eV and 374.4 eV can be related to the characteristic orbital splitting of the Ag 3d 5/2 and Ag 3d 3/2 , respectively, which are features of metal Ag 15,31. We further analyzed the optical properties of the commercial TiO 2 and the prepared hierarchically porous TiO 2 and Ag/TiO 2 via UV-vis spectroscopy, as shown in Fig. 6a.It is found that the absorption band edge of the commercial TiO 2 is about 400 nm, and a weak tail extending to 460 nm is observed on the prepared hierarchically porous TiO 2 , suggestive of the existence of defects.More importantly, the sample Ag/ TiO 2 exhibits broad absorption in the visible region due to the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect of Ag quantum dot, further confirming the presence of Ag in the sample Ag/TiO 2 .repeatedly to further evaluate the separation efficiency of photogenerated charges, as shown in Fig. 6c.Commercial TiO 2 shows a weak photocurrent response while the prepared samples, especially Ag/TiO 2 , show significantly enhanced photocurrent density and photocurrent response, further suggesting that the effective separation rate of photogenerated charges on the sample Ag/TiO , which can lead to more available electrons generated from the sample Ag/TiO 2 . The adsorption of CO 2 on the catalysts is the first step in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction, thus the temperature programmed desorption of CO 2 (CO 2 -TPD) of the samples have been investigated, as shown in Fig. 7a.Compared with commercial TiO 2 , the prepared hierarchically porous TiO 2 and Ag/TiO 2 show super CO 2 adsorption capacity due to the construction of defects and typical hierarchically porous structure.Especially, the sample Ag/TiO 2 exhibits significantly improved CO 2 adsorption performance, which can be resulted from its high BET surface area, rich oxygen vacancies and the synergetic effect between Ag quantum dots and TiO 2 .We conducted FTIR measurement to further explore the CO 2 adsorption performance on the sample Ag/ TiO 2 , as shown in Fig. S3.When CO 2 and water vapor are introduced into the reactor for 30 min in the dark, there are two peaks at 1640 cm -1 and 1392 cm -1 can be detected, corresponding to the monodentate and bidentate bicarbonate species 3233.It hints that the CO 2 molecules can be adsorbed on the catalyst.Under the photoirradiation, the intensities of these peaks assigned to monodentate and bidentate bicarbonate species increase, which may be related to the large thermodynamic tendency for the conversion of CO 2 -CO 3 2- 32. The photocatalytic activities of CO 2 reduction over all samples under UV-vis light irradiation are shown in Fig. 7b-c.During the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 , only gas CO as reduction product can be detected on the samples, while H 2 as byproducts can be not observe.It may be because the catalyst provides a driving force that overcomes the energy barrier of CO 2 reduction to rather than the H 2 evolution, similar to previous report 34.Besides, no products have been detected before photocatalytic reaction, hinting that the product CO is derived from CO 2 photoreduction.To further illustrate the origin of CO, carbon isotope analysis ( 13 C) has been performed via mass spectra, and the result is shown in Fig. S4.There is 13 CO detected in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 , further implying that the product CO is from CO 2 .As displayed in Fig. 7b, the stable CO yield with the time can be achieved on the prepared hierarchically porous TiO 2 and Ag/TiO 2 , and the CO yield on the sample Ag/TiO 2 (2.3 mol g -1 ) is about 1.5 times higher than that on pure TiO 2 (1.5 mol g -1 ) after 4 h UV-vis light irradiation, which is also higher than the TiO 2 /AC-Ag ternary composite (1.5445 mol g -1 in 4 h) reported in the literature 35.However, the commercial TiO 2 with low BET surface area (8 m 2 g -1 ) has not almost photocatalytic activity toward CO 2 reduction.Besides, the reference P25 TiO 2 with higher BET surface area (58 m 2 g -1 ) also shows relative weak activity to CO 2 reduction, as shown in Figs.S5-S6.In order to prove the contribution of defects in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 , the defective P25 has been prepared and the catalytic activity has shown in the Fig. S6.It can been seen that the yield of CO on the defective P25 is up to 1.1 mol g -1 in 4 h, which is higher than that on the conventional P25.These results suggest that the intrinsic defects (i.e., low valance Ti species, oxygen vacancies) in TiO 2 can also act as active sites and accelerate the adsorption and activation of CO 2 , improving the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity.Especially, the sample Ag/TiO 2 exhibits better photocatalytic activity than TiO 2 , indicating that the synergetic effect between Ag and TiO 2 can further promote the reduction of CO 2 .Further, the long-term stability of the sample Ag/TiO 2 is also tested, and it is found that the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity nearly remains after five cycles under UV-vis light irradiation (Fig. 7c).Additionally, the Ag content in the used sample Ag/TiO 2 is about 0.81 wt, which is very close to the Ag content in the fresh sample.This result suggests that the Ag leaching from the catalyst in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction is almost negligible, which is also the reason for the excellent stability and activity of the catalyst.The excellent recyclability and stability will be of great interest for achieving high-efficiency CO 2 reduction. Based on the above results and discussions, we propose a possible mechanism of the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction on the sample Ag/TiO 2 .The photocatalytic mechanism and the charge transfer for the Ag/TiO 2 are schematically illustrated in Fig. 7d.Under light irradiation, the reduction of CO 2 on the sample Ag/TiO 2 can be implemented via three routes.Firstly, the electrons and holes are generated on the semiconductor TiO 2 .Then, the excited electrons can transfer to the defect sites (Ti 3 -Vo) and further reduce CO 2 to CO (route i), similar to previous report 36.Therefore, the pure hierarchically porous TiO 2 with rich defect sites shows good photocatalytic activity in the CO 2 reduction (Fig. 7b).Secondly, the modification of Ag quantum dots on the support TiO 2 also further improve the photocatalytic activity, as shown in Fig. 7b.It is because Ag as cocatalyst can rapidly capture photogenerated electrons from the TiO 2 and accelerate the separation efficiency of photogenerated charges.Finally, the captured electrons on the Ag quantum dots would react with the adsorbed CO 2 molecules to produce CO (route ii).In the photoreduction of CO 2 , the presence of Ag quantum dots not only improves the visible light absorption performance (Fig. 6a), but also promotes the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes (Fig. 6b).More importantly, more hot electrons are also generated on metal Ag due to SPR effect (route iii), the produced hot plasmonic electrons can further transfer to the TiO 2 nanoparticles or adjacent metal Ag and reduce CO 2 to CO.Therefore, the sample Ag/TiO 2 shows better performance in the CO 2 reduction compared with the sample TiO 2 , which can be ascribed to the synergetic effects between Ag and TiO 2 .Meanwhile, the photo-induced holes on the TiO 2 would oxidize H 2 O into OH."}], "lamp": [{"llm generation": "Xenon", "source": "A 300 W Xe lamp was employed as light source.", "context": "Tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH, AR, 25 wt) was purchased from Aladdin, China.Titanium sulfate (Ti(SO 4 ) 2 , CR), commercial TiO 2 (CR), reference P25 (CR) and silver nitrate (AgNO 3 , CR) were provided from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd without further purification in this work.
