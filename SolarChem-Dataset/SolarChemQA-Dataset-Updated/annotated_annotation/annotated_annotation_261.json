Fig. 1.XRD patterns of g-C3N4, In2O3, and 10 wt In2O3-g-C3N4. . The XRD pattern of In 2 O 3 gives rise to six distinct diffraction peaks at 21.5 , 30.6 , 35.6 , 45.4 , 50.9 , and 60.8 , which can be attributed to the (2 1 1), (2 2 2), (4 0 0), (4 3 1), (4 4 0), and (6 2 2) crystal planes of cubic In 2 O 3 (JCPDS No. 71-2194), respectively.The In 2 O 3 -g-C 3 N 4 hybrids exhibit characteristic XRD peaks of both In 2 O 3 and g-C 3 N 4 .

Fig. 5a shows the H 2 evolution plots by g-C 3 N 4 , In 2 O 3 , and In 2 O 3 -g-C 3 N 4 hybrids (10 wt In 2 O 3 ) as a function of irradiation time.The pure In 2 O 3 sample did not show noticeable H 2 evolution, and the pure g-C 3 N 4 showed a H 2 generation rate of 0.19 mol/h.Remarkably, when 10 wt In 2 O 3 nanocrystals are decorated on g-C 3 N 4 surfaces, the hybrid structure exhibited five times higher H 2 generation rate (0.99 mol/h) than the pure g-C 3 N 4 . Fig. 4. XPS spectra of 10 wt In2O3-g-C3N4: (a) C 1s; (b) N 1s; (c) In 3d; (d) O 1s.However, the decoration content of In 2 O 3 showed considerable influence on the photocatalytic activity of the In 2 O 3 -g-C 3 N 4 hybrids.Even with small amount of In 2 O 3 (2.5 wt) nanocrystals on g--C 3 N 4 surfaces, the H 2 evolution amount can be 2.4 times higher than that of pure g-C 3 N 4 .As shown in Fig. 5b, the photocatalytic activity of the In 2 O 3 -g-C 3 N 4 hybrids increases with more H 2 generation as the In 2 O 3 content rise to 10 wt.However, excessive In 2 O 3 nanocrystals (10 wt) grown on g-C 3 N 4 surfaces led to decreased photocatalytic activity in H 2 generation, which might be due to the aggregation of In 2 O 3 nanocrystals.As shown in Fig. 6a, in the hybrid sample with 20 wt In 2 O 3 , excess In 2 O 3 nanocrystals are aggregating on the g-C 3 N 4 surface, which reduces the interface area between In 2 O 3 and g-C 3 N 4 and thereby lower the charge separation efficiency relying on interfacial electron transfer.In addition, over-coverage of In 2 O 3 may reduce reactive sites on g-C 3 N 4 surfaces that are needed to quench the holes.This would also cause decreased photocatalytic activity.In short, our observation indicates that the optimal decoration amount of In 2 O 3 nanocrystals is 10 wt to obtain the highest photocatalytic activity for H 2 generation.We further explore the stability of the optimal In 2 O 3 -g-C 3 N 4 hybrids (10 wt In 2 O 3 ) by a four-run cycling test of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.Fig. 6b reveals that no obvious decrease of H 2 evolution was observed after the four cycles under 16-h visible light irradiation, suggesting the excellent stability of the In 2 O 3 -g-C 3 N 4 hybrids in the reactions.In order to further demonstrate the improved photocatalytic activity by the in-situ grown In 2 O 3 nanocrystals on g-C 3 N 4 , the prepared samples were evaluated by using reaction of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction into hydrocarbon fuels that is known as a challenging but promising application for sustainable energy resources454647.As shown in Fig.7a, after 4-h irradiation, the optimal In 2 O 3 -g-C 3 N 4 hybrids with 10 wt In 2 O 3 exhibited a CH 4 production yield of 76.7 ppm (over 20 mg samples) without any cocatalyst, which is more than three times higher than that of pure g-C 3 N 4 and more than four times higher than that of pure In 2 O 3 .The influence of In 2 O 3 loading content on the CH 4 production yield showed a Fig. 5.
