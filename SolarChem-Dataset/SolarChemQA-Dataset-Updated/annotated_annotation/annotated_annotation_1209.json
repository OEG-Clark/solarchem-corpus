CO 2 reduction was conducted on a Labsolar-6A system (Beijing Perfectlight Technology Co., Ltd.).A mixed solution of MeCN and TEOA (4:1, 100 mL) containing ImI-CMPCo (10 mg) and Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 (30 mg) was put in the container.After the gas in the container was removed via vacuum, CO 2 was injected to 80 kPa.Then, the mixture was irradiated by a 300 W Xe lamp ( 420 nm) and stirred during photocatalytic reaction.An Agilent 8890 gas chromatograph was used to quantify the amount of CO.For the recirculation test, we used 50 mg catalyst and everything else remained the same.In the recovery experiment, the catalyst was separated and washed with MeCN and then redispersed into a new mixture, and then a photocatalytic test was carried out under the same conditions as before.The TOF was calculated based on the ratio of CO production to metal content and time, i.e., TOF n CO (mol)/n Co (mol)/t (h).

To verify this design concept, the corresponding experiments are carried out based on the simulated results above.This ImI-CMP is first synthesized through the combination of ionic linkers and neutral knots via Sonogashira-Hagihara cross-coupling reaction (Fig. 2a).TEPM is used as a neutral knot and BPIB as cationic linker for the construction of the ImI-CMP in which the cationic sites are exposed to the wall surface.This polymer network is designed to have a three-dimensional net structure arising from the four-pronged arylene-ethynylene linkages.The structure of the ImI-CMP is characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), solid-state cross polarization magic-angle spinning (CP-MAS) 13 C NMR, N 2 adsorption/desorption isotherms, powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and elemental analysis.The chemical structures of the obtained ImI-CMP are confirmed by FT-IR (Fig. S2).The peak at 2209 cm -1 of the ImI-CMP indicates the formation of -C ---Cbonds 31.The peak at 3284 cm -1 assigned to -C ---C-H in the TEPM disappears after the cross-coupling reaction, proving the total conversion of the precursor.ImI-CMP is extensively characterized using 13 C solid-state NMR (Fig. 2b).The peak located at 63.0 ppm is attributed to the quaternary carbon core of tetraphenyl methane.The peaks at 128.5 ppm and 143.2 ppm correspond to aromatic C-C and C-H sites, while the peaks at 75.4 ppm and 88.5 ppm belong to C(sp)-C(sp) and C (sp)-C(sp 2 ) sites 32.These also verify the successful synthesis of the ImI-CMP 15. The ImI-CMP exhibits a reversible type I isotherm in combination with type IV characteristics in N 2 adsorption-desorption analysis (Fig. 2c).The rapid increase at a relatively low-pressure range (below P/ P 0 0.01) indicates the permanent microporous nature of the ImI-CMP.The hysteresis loop in a higher relative pressure range could be attributed to the presence of mesopores.The pore-size distribution curve is shown in Fig. S3.Micropores and mesopores centered at 0.57 nm, 1.42 nm and 3.39 nm give a total pore volume of 0.583 cm 3 g -1 , in which the micropore volume is 0.078 cm 3 g -1 .It is calculated that the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of the ImI-CMP is 529 m 2 g -1 , in which the micropore surface area is 166 m 2 g -1 .The PXRD pattern shows that the obtained ImI-CMP is amorphous, without any crystalline phase or catalyst residues (Fig. S4).As cationic polymers face problems with chemical stability, we also investigate the thermal stability of the ImI-CMP by thermogravimetric testing (TG) 15.The ImI-CMP exhibits exceptional thermal stability and remains stable up to 320 C under an Ar atmosphere presumably due to the well-spaced charged groups within the three-dimensional network (Fig. S5).The slight weight loss below 200 C mostly results from the trapped solvent molecules in the pores.High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses are used to investigate the bulk-scale morphology of ImI-CMP (Fig. S6).As we can see from the HRTEM images, the ImI-CMP is highly microporous.SEM images indicate that the ImI-CMP forms 3D mesoporous networks composed of spherical particles with a size distribution centered at 20 nm.The distribution of the C/N/Br in the ImI-CMP are verified by elemental mapping under SEM mode (Fig. S7).Element analytical tests suggest that the contents of C, N, H and Br are 63.5, 6.0, 4.5 and 8.0, respectively.In addition, the nonionic CMP is also synthesized as comparison (Figs.S8 andS9). It was reported that the introduction of ionic surfaces in COFs can enhance the CO 2 affinity through dipole-quadruple interactions and the CO 2 adsorption isotherms of the ImI-CMP are measured up to 1 bar at 273 K and 298 K 22.The CO 2 adsorption isotherms display reversible adsorption capacity (Fig. 2d).When the actual pressure P of CO 2 approaches 760 mm Hg (P/P 0 1), the CO 2 uptake reach 82 mg g -1 and 41 mg g -1 at 273 K and 298 K, respectively 33,34.All of the trapped CO 2 can be totally released at P/P 0 0.The adsorption isosteric heat Q st calculated from the temperature-dependent CO 2 adsorption isotherms (273 K and 298 K) is in a narrow range (31-37 kJ mol -1 ) and decrease initially from 37 kJ mol -1 to 32 kJ mol -1 for CO 2 uptakes of 0.3-6 mg g -1 .It then remains steady for CO 2 uptakes up to 34 mg g -1 (Fig. 2e) 34.The Q st is much higher than most of the reported COFs, CMPs and MOFs, e.g., 22 kJ mol -1 for TpBpy-COF, 22 kJ mol -1 for Por-sp 2 c-COF, 25 kJ mol -1 for PCP-Cl and 27 kJ mol -1 for MFM-300 (In)-t.15,353637.The high Q st can be evidence of the strong electrostatic interactions between CO 2 molecules and the charged skeletons along with the ionic surface within the pores 15. To evaluate CO 2 chemisorption on the ImI-CMP, CO 2 -temperature programmed desorption (CO 2 -TPD) experiment is performed (Fig. 2f).The TPD curve shows two CO 2 desorption peaks at 50-130 C and 160-280 C. Apart from the weakly adsorbed CO 2 below 100 C, desorption around 160-280 C can be associated with CO 2 molecules that are strongly adsorbed on the ImI-CMP 38.In contrast, the TPD curve of the nonionic CMP shows no CO 2 desorption at temperatures up to 320 C (Fig. S10).These results indicate that the chemisorption of CO 2 in the ImI-CMPs mainly occurs on the imidazolium motifs.The simulation in MAPS was used to further study the CO 2 adsorption behavior visually in the ImI-CMP.The porous structure leaves enough space between cationic sites which enables the accessibility of the cationic sites by CO 2 molecules 22.The microporosity of this ImI-CMP stems from the rigid but contorted backbone 39.The distribution of CO 2 adsorbed on ImI-CMP obtained from the Monte Carlo simulation at 273 K and 1 bar is shown in Fig. 2g.The density field for CO 2 in the ImI-CMP shows that the CO 2 molecules occupied the pores in the ImI-CMP.The porous structure of the ImI-CMP can enrich the adsorption of CO 2 40. Due to the high affinity of ImI-CMP to CO 2 and its excellent chemical stability, the photoreduction of CO 2 is conducted with ImI-CMPCo as the catalyst in 0.8 bar of CO 2 under visible light ( 420 nm).Co (II) has been recognized as one of the most active centers for adsorbing and activating CO 2 molecules and even for achieving photocatalytic CO 2 reduction 28,41,42.Here we synthesize the ImI-CMPCo from the ImI-CMP and cobalt acetate.The XPS spectrum shows the presence of C, N, O, and Co in ImI-CMPCo (Fig. S11a).The observed Co 2p 3/2 binding energy of 781.5 eV with a shakeup satellite at 786.5 eV in ImI-CMPCo is consistent with Co (II) indicating the successful loading of Co ions into ImI-CMP (Fig. S11b) 42.The N 1s signal of ImI-CMP and ImI-CMPCo can be deconvoluted into 3 peaks at 398.5, 399.6 and 401.2 eV, respectively (Fig. S11c andd).Particularly, the peak at 398.5 eV can relative to pyridinic-N in ImI-CMP and pyridinic-N/Co-N in ImI-CMPCo.The binding energy of 398.5 eV in ImI-CMPCo is much stronger than that in ImI-CMP, signifying the existence of Co -N bonds to anchor the metallic Co 2 43,44. For the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 (bpy 2,2 bipyridine) was used as a visible-light photosensitizer, and triethanolamine (TEOA) was adopted as an electron donor.CO and H 2 are detected as the main products (Figs.3a andb andS12).ImI-CMPCo exhibits excellent activity with a CO production rate of 2953 mol g -1 h -1 and a turnover frequency (TOF) of 30.8 h -1 in 35 min 11,42.The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) at 420 nm is calculated to be 0.52 (Xe lamp current 15 A, light intensity 34.6 mW cm -2 , 10 mg ImI-CMPCo catalyst).The CO production rate and TOF for CO evolution in 3.5 h remain high at 1884 mol g -1 h -1 and 19.5 h -1 , which far outstrip the ImI-CMP (Fig. 3a).The TOF and CO production rate are competitive to the state-of-art porous photocatalysts (Table S2).Other examples include a CO production rate of 1020 mol g -1 h -1 (TOF 0.55 h -1 in 4 h) for DQTP COF-Co 42, 1213.33 mol g -1 h -1 in 1 h for CMP-BT 45, 2274 mol g -1 h -1 (TOF 3.71 h -1 in 5 h) for N-CP-D 28, 469 mol g -1 h -1 in 4 h for CNU-BA 46.To identify the function of the imidazolium motifs in the ImI-CMP in improving the photoreduction of CO 2 to CO, the CMP without imidazolium motifs (Fig. 3a) is also employed in the catalytic reaction.Under identical reaction conditions, the CO production rate was much lower with nonionic CMPCo as the catalyst, indicating the key role of imidazolium motifs in the photocatalytic reaction 3,4,20,23. The simultaneous production of CO and H 2 (syngas) with fixed CO/ H 2 ratios has been considered very useful, which can be subsequently utilized in achieving value-added feedstocks through following thermochemical processes, e.g., Fisher-Tropsch process and methanol synthesis reactions 47,48.The conventional approaches to syngas are based on reforming non-renewable fossil fuels (e.g., coal, petroleum coke and natural gas) operating at high temperatures of 800-1000 C and pressures of 5-40 bar 484950.While the CO/H 2 ratio is very important for controlling the different downstream products selectivity, producing the desired CO/H 2 ratio with CO 2 as a feedstock is still challenging 47.Interestingly, the n(H 2 )/n(CO) in this photocatalytic CO 2 reduction process by the ImI-CMPCo keeps 2 (Figs.3b andS12), which is a proper proportion exclusively for methanol production 495051. A series of control experiments are performed to identify the key factors for CO 2 -to-CO conversion (Fig. 3b).When photocatalytic experiments are performed with N 2 instead of CO 2 under the same reaction conditions, CO was not detected (Fig. 3b), which preliminarily proves that CO originates from CO 2 .No CO is detected under the conditions without light irradiation or in the absence of photosensitizer and triethanolamine.These indicate the necessity for light, photosensitizer and triethanolamine in the CO 2 reduction process.To further confirm the origin of the CO, isotope-labeled carbon dioxide ( 13 CO 2 ) is employed as a substitute source gas on a GC-MS system 28. 13CO is observed in the gas chromatogram and mass spectrum (a peak at m/z 29) (Fig. 3c).These results demonstrate that the carbon source of the formed CO was CO 2 .In addition, the amount of photosensitizer, solvent proportion and the sacrificial agent type also affect the rate of CO 2 reduction to some extent (Figs.S13 and14).The stability of ImI-CMPCo is examined by running the experiments over 140 min for five cycles (Fig. S15).We also tested CO production over a longer period of time of 385 min, which shows constant photocatalytic activity (Fig. S16).The test demonstrates that the catalyst has good stability during the photocatalytic reactions.In addition, there is no obvious change in catalyst structures and morphology as observed in the SEM images of the ImI-CMPCo before and after reaction (Fig. S17).In addition to SEM, we used FT-IR test before and after the catalytic reaction to characterize its chemical stability (Fig. S18).The FT-IR spectrum of the catalyst after reaction shows the additional peak of the photosensitizer Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 at 3166 cm -1 , indicating the adsorption of Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 in the pores of the ImI-CMP-Co, which may result in poor CO 2 adsorption and slight decline of cyclic stability 52. To study the photoelectric properties of ImI-CMPs, photocurrent test is conducted (Fig. 3d).The ImI-CMPs photocathodes show high photocurrent (67 A cm -1 for ImI-CMPCo and 43 A cm -1 for ImI-CMP photoanode).The extremely high photocurrent shows a greatly 3d).These results show that ImI-CMPCo acts as a better photoelectrocatalyst with faster charge separation and transfer.Moreover, the photocurrents of the nonionic CMPCo are two orders of magnitude lower than ImI-CMP and ImI-CMPCo, indicating that the presence of imidazolium motifs is crucial for fast charge separation and transfer. To gain more mechanistic insights into the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 by ImI-CMPCo, we conduct spectroscopic characterization of the CMPs.The UV-vis absorption spectra of ImI-CMP and ImI-CMPCo show good UV and visible light ( 420 nm) absorption performance (Fig. 4a) 42.The intramolecular charge transfer behavior of ImI-CMP is investigated by solid-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved fluorescence decay techniques.The PL of ImI-CMPCo shows much weaker intensity than the ImI-CMP (Fig. 4b), illustrating that the existence of Co 2 can effectively prevent electron-hole recombination and quench the PL intensity.Thus the Co incorporation on ImI-CMP could enhance the electron transfer for the following photoreduction of CO 2 .The average fluorescence life expectancies of the ImI-CMP and ImI-CMPCo are 0.86 and 0.63 ns (Fig. 4c andd).The shorter life expectancies of the ImI-CMPCo can be attributed to the fast delivery of photogenerated electrons from the ImI-CMP to cobalt ions 11.Moreover, the PL decay spectra of the nonionic CMPs show much stronger PL intensity (Figs.S19 andS20), which suggests a weak ability of the nonionic CMP to suppress the recombination of excited state 42.Nanosecond transient absorption (TA) spectroscopic studies are also carried out on the CMPs to further explore the photophysics of the system.The TA spectroscopy of the ImI-CMP and ImI-CMPCo are conducted at 355 nm to reflect the degradation on the exciton and charge carrier dynamics in real time 53.The spectrum of ImI-CMP is fitted with 1 75 ns (52) and 2 348 ns (48).ImI-CMPCo is fitted with 1 188 ns (41) and 2 1480 ns (59), indicating the generation of a much longer lifetime of photogenerated carriers on the surface of ImI-CMPCo (Fig. 4e).The significantly prolonged lifetime and the larger proportion of 2 demonstrate that the separation of electron-hole pairs is greatly promoted after the incorporation of Co 10,52.The efficient electron transfer is important for the photoreduction reactions 11,54.All the above results reveal that ImI-CMPCo is favorable for promoting photogenerated electron transfer during the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction process.This in turn endows ImI-CMPCo with high photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity 11. The Mott-Schottky plots are measured at three frequencies (Figs.4f andS21).The positive slopes of the curves indicate that the ImI-CMP is a typical n-type semiconductor 55.The flat band potentials of ImI-CMPCo is approximately -1.48 V vs Ag/AgCl (ImI-CMPCo) at pH 7.The following equation is used to convert the obtained potential (vs.Ag/AgCl) to NHE at pH 7 56. Hence ImI-CMPCo have enough negative potential to enable the reduction of CO 2 to CO (-0.53 V vs NHE at pH 7) 27.By contrast, the flat band potentials of nonionic CMP and nonionic CMPCo are -0.22V and -0.36 V (Figs.S22 andS23), which are too low to reduce CO 2 .These results are well consistent with the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction results. Together, these spectroscopic and DFT results above point to a possible mechanistic pathway for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 over ImI-CMPCo (Fig. 5).CO 2 is first concentrated around the imidazolium motif inside the pores.Upon light irradiation, Ru (bpy) 3 2 is converted to the excited state Ru(bpy) 3 2 .Then the photogenerated electrons are transferred to the ImI-CMP and the TEOA consumes the produced holes 35,42.Meanwhile, intramolecular charge transfer occurs inside the ImI-CMP with the effect of built-in electric field.The electron-rich TEPM segment acts as an electron donor.The positively BPIB segment with imidazolium cations is electron-deficient and acts as an electron acceptor 23.The photoexcited electrons on the TEPM segment then transfer to the BPIB segment in the built-in electric field with alkynyl as a bridge 28 between the imidazolium cation and CO 2 - changes the active intermediate from the high-energy CO 2 - ion radical to an imidazolium CO 2 - complex 3,4,20,23.The linear C--O--C bond angle is bent when ion pairing occurs at the interface of the ImI-CMP 4.This complex intermediate then undergo reduction to form CO, which is then released from the ImI-CMP surface, regenerating the uncomplexed imidazolium cation in the catalytic cycle.This cascaded electron pathway enables oriented electron delivery from the ImI-CMPs to metal sites and achieves an efficient system for CO 2 photoreduction 28."}, {"llm generation": "nonionic CMPCo", "source": "Fig. 3.

CO 2 reduction was conducted on a Labsolar-6A system (Beijing Perfectlight Technology Co., Ltd.).A mixed solution of MeCN and TEOA (4:1, 100 mL) containing ImI-CMPCo (10 mg) and Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 (30 mg) was put in the container.After the gas in the container was removed via vacuum, CO 2 was injected to 80 kPa.Then, the mixture was irradiated by a 300 W Xe lamp ( 420 nm) and stirred during photocatalytic reaction.An Agilent 8890 gas chromatograph was used to quantify the amount of CO.For the recirculation test, we used 50 mg catalyst and everything else remained the same.In the recovery experiment, the catalyst was separated and washed with MeCN and then redispersed into a new mixture, and then a photocatalytic test was carried out under the same conditions as before.The TOF was calculated based on the ratio of CO production to metal content and time, i.e., TOF n CO (mol)/n Co (mol)/t (h).

To verify this design concept, the corresponding experiments are carried out based on the simulated results above.This ImI-CMP is first synthesized through the combination of ionic linkers and neutral knots via Sonogashira-Hagihara cross-coupling reaction (Fig. 2a).TEPM is used as a neutral knot and BPIB as cationic linker for the construction of the ImI-CMP in which the cationic sites are exposed to the wall surface.This polymer network is designed to have a three-dimensional net structure arising from the four-pronged arylene-ethynylene linkages.The structure of the ImI-CMP is characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), solid-state cross polarization magic-angle spinning (CP-MAS) 13 C NMR, N 2 adsorption/desorption isotherms, powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and elemental analysis.The chemical structures of the obtained ImI-CMP are confirmed by FT-IR (Fig. S2).The peak at 2209 cm -1 of the ImI-CMP indicates the formation of -C ---Cbonds 31.The peak at 3284 cm -1 assigned to -C ---C-H in the TEPM disappears after the cross-coupling reaction, proving the total conversion of the precursor.ImI-CMP is extensively characterized using 13 C solid-state NMR (Fig. 2b).The peak located at 63.0 ppm is attributed to the quaternary carbon core of tetraphenyl methane.The peaks at 128.5 ppm and 143.2 ppm correspond to aromatic C-C and C-H sites, while the peaks at 75.4 ppm and 88.5 ppm belong to C(sp)-C(sp) and C (sp)-C(sp 2 ) sites 32.These also verify the successful synthesis of the ImI-CMP 15. The ImI-CMP exhibits a reversible type I isotherm in combination with type IV characteristics in N 2 adsorption-desorption analysis (Fig. 2c).The rapid increase at a relatively low-pressure range (below P/ P 0 0.01) indicates the permanent microporous nature of the ImI-CMP.The hysteresis loop in a higher relative pressure range could be attributed to the presence of mesopores.The pore-size distribution curve is shown in Fig. S3.Micropores and mesopores centered at 0.57 nm, 1.42 nm and 3.39 nm give a total pore volume of 0.583 cm 3 g -1 , in which the micropore volume is 0.078 cm 3 g -1 .It is calculated that the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of the ImI-CMP is 529 m 2 g -1 , in which the micropore surface area is 166 m 2 g -1 .The PXRD pattern shows that the obtained ImI-CMP is amorphous, without any crystalline phase or catalyst residues (Fig. S4).As cationic polymers face problems with chemical stability, we also investigate the thermal stability of the ImI-CMP by thermogravimetric testing (TG) 15.The ImI-CMP exhibits exceptional thermal stability and remains stable up to 320 C under an Ar atmosphere presumably due to the well-spaced charged groups within the three-dimensional network (Fig. S5).The slight weight loss below 200 C mostly results from the trapped solvent molecules in the pores.High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses are used to investigate the bulk-scale morphology of ImI-CMP (Fig. S6).As we can see from the HRTEM images, the ImI-CMP is highly microporous.SEM images indicate that the ImI-CMP forms 3D mesoporous networks composed of spherical particles with a size distribution centered at 20 nm.The distribution of the C/N/Br in the ImI-CMP are verified by elemental mapping under SEM mode (Fig. S7).Element analytical tests suggest that the contents of C, N, H and Br are 63.5, 6.0, 4.5 and 8.0, respectively.In addition, the nonionic CMP is also synthesized as comparison (Figs.S8 andS9). It was reported that the introduction of ionic surfaces in COFs can enhance the CO 2 affinity through dipole-quadruple interactions and the CO 2 adsorption isotherms of the ImI-CMP are measured up to 1 bar at 273 K and 298 K 22.The CO 2 adsorption isotherms display reversible adsorption capacity (Fig. 2d).When the actual pressure P of CO 2 approaches 760 mm Hg (P/P 0 1), the CO 2 uptake reach 82 mg g -1 and 41 mg g -1 at 273 K and 298 K, respectively 33,34.All of the trapped CO 2 can be totally released at P/P 0 0.The adsorption isosteric heat Q st calculated from the temperature-dependent CO 2 adsorption isotherms (273 K and 298 K) is in a narrow range (31-37 kJ mol -1 ) and decrease initially from 37 kJ mol -1 to 32 kJ mol -1 for CO 2 uptakes of 0.3-6 mg g -1 .It then remains steady for CO 2 uptakes up to 34 mg g -1 (Fig. 2e) 34.The Q st is much higher than most of the reported COFs, CMPs and MOFs, e.g., 22 kJ mol -1 for TpBpy-COF, 22 kJ mol -1 for Por-sp 2 c-COF, 25 kJ mol -1 for PCP-Cl and 27 kJ mol -1 for MFM-300 (In)-t.15,353637.The high Q st can be evidence of the strong electrostatic interactions between CO 2 molecules and the charged skeletons along with the ionic surface within the pores 15. To evaluate CO 2 chemisorption on the ImI-CMP, CO 2 -temperature programmed desorption (CO 2 -TPD) experiment is performed (Fig. 2f).The TPD curve shows two CO 2 desorption peaks at 50-130 C and 160-280 C. Apart from the weakly adsorbed CO 2 below 100 C, desorption around 160-280 C can be associated with CO 2 molecules that are strongly adsorbed on the ImI-CMP 38.In contrast, the TPD curve of the nonionic CMP shows no CO 2 desorption at temperatures up to 320 C (Fig. S10).These results indicate that the chemisorption of CO 2 in the ImI-CMPs mainly occurs on the imidazolium motifs.The simulation in MAPS was used to further study the CO 2 adsorption behavior visually in the ImI-CMP.The porous structure leaves enough space between cationic sites which enables the accessibility of the cationic sites by CO 2 molecules 22.The microporosity of this ImI-CMP stems from the rigid but contorted backbone 39.The distribution of CO 2 adsorbed on ImI-CMP obtained from the Monte Carlo simulation at 273 K and 1 bar is shown in Fig. 2g.The density field for CO 2 in the ImI-CMP shows that the CO 2 molecules occupied the pores in the ImI-CMP.The porous structure of the ImI-CMP can enrich the adsorption of CO 2 40. Due to the high affinity of ImI-CMP to CO 2 and its excellent chemical stability, the photoreduction of CO 2 is conducted with ImI-CMPCo as the catalyst in 0.8 bar of CO 2 under visible light ( 420 nm).Co (II) has been recognized as one of the most active centers for adsorbing and activating CO 2 molecules and even for achieving photocatalytic CO 2 reduction 28,41,42.Here we synthesize the ImI-CMPCo from the ImI-CMP and cobalt acetate.The XPS spectrum shows the presence of C, N, O, and Co in ImI-CMPCo (Fig. S11a).The observed Co 2p 3/2 binding energy of 781.5 eV with a shakeup satellite at 786.5 eV in ImI-CMPCo is consistent with Co (II) indicating the successful loading of Co ions into ImI-CMP (Fig. S11b) 42.The N 1s signal of ImI-CMP and ImI-CMPCo can be deconvoluted into 3 peaks at 398.5, 399.6 and 401.2 eV, respectively (Fig. S11c andd).Particularly, the peak at 398.5 eV can relative to pyridinic-N in ImI-CMP and pyridinic-N/Co-N in ImI-CMPCo.The binding energy of 398.5 eV in ImI-CMPCo is much stronger than that in ImI-CMP, signifying the existence of Co -N bonds to anchor the metallic Co 2 43,44. For the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 (bpy 2,2 bipyridine) was used as a visible-light photosensitizer, and triethanolamine (TEOA) was adopted as an electron donor.CO and H 2 are detected as the main products (Figs.3a andb andS12).ImI-CMPCo exhibits excellent activity with a CO production rate of 2953 mol g -1 h -1 and a turnover frequency (TOF) of 30.8 h -1 in 35 min 11,42.The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) at 420 nm is calculated to be 0.52 (Xe lamp current 15 A, light intensity 34.6 mW cm -2 , 10 mg ImI-CMPCo catalyst).The CO production rate and TOF for CO evolution in 3.5 h remain high at 1884 mol g -1 h -1 and 19.5 h -1 , which far outstrip the ImI-CMP (Fig. 3a).The TOF and CO production rate are competitive to the state-of-art porous photocatalysts (Table S2).Other examples include a CO production rate of 1020 mol g -1 h -1 (TOF 0.55 h -1 in 4 h) for DQTP COF-Co 42, 1213.33 mol g -1 h -1 in 1 h for CMP-BT 45, 2274 mol g -1 h -1 (TOF 3.71 h -1 in 5 h) for N-CP-D 28, 469 mol g -1 h -1 in 4 h for CNU-BA 46.To identify the function of the imidazolium motifs in the ImI-CMP in improving the photoreduction of CO 2 to CO, the CMP without imidazolium motifs (Fig. 3a) is also employed in the catalytic reaction.Under identical reaction conditions, the CO production rate was much lower with nonionic CMPCo as the catalyst, indicating the key role of imidazolium motifs in the photocatalytic reaction 3,4,20,23. The simultaneous production of CO and H 2 (syngas) with fixed CO/ H 2 ratios has been considered very useful, which can be subsequently utilized in achieving value-added feedstocks through following thermochemical processes, e.g., Fisher-Tropsch process and methanol synthesis reactions 47,48.The conventional approaches to syngas are based on reforming non-renewable fossil fuels (e.g., coal, petroleum coke and natural gas) operating at high temperatures of 800-1000 C and pressures of 5-40 bar 484950.While the CO/H 2 ratio is very important for controlling the different downstream products selectivity, producing the desired CO/H 2 ratio with CO 2 as a feedstock is still challenging 47.Interestingly, the n(H 2 )/n(CO) in this photocatalytic CO 2 reduction process by the ImI-CMPCo keeps 2 (Figs.3b andS12), which is a proper proportion exclusively for methanol production 495051. A series of control experiments are performed to identify the key factors for CO 2 -to-CO conversion (Fig. 3b).When photocatalytic experiments are performed with N 2 instead of CO 2 under the same reaction conditions, CO was not detected (Fig. 3b), which preliminarily proves that CO originates from CO 2 .No CO is detected under the conditions without light irradiation or in the absence of photosensitizer and triethanolamine.These indicate the necessity for light, photosensitizer and triethanolamine in the CO 2 reduction process.To further confirm the origin of the CO, isotope-labeled carbon dioxide ( 13 CO 2 ) is employed as a substitute source gas on a GC-MS system 28. 13CO is observed in the gas chromatogram and mass spectrum (a peak at m/z 29) (Fig. 3c).These results demonstrate that the carbon source of the formed CO was CO 2 .In addition, the amount of photosensitizer, solvent proportion and the sacrificial agent type also affect the rate of CO 2 reduction to some extent (Figs.S13 and14).The stability of ImI-CMPCo is examined by running the experiments over 140 min for five cycles (Fig. S15).We also tested CO production over a longer period of time of 385 min, which shows constant photocatalytic activity (Fig. S16).The test demonstrates that the catalyst has good stability during the photocatalytic reactions.In addition, there is no obvious change in catalyst structures and morphology as observed in the SEM images of the ImI-CMPCo before and after reaction (Fig. S17).In addition to SEM, we used FT-IR test before and after the catalytic reaction to characterize its chemical stability (Fig. S18).The FT-IR spectrum of the catalyst after reaction shows the additional peak of the photosensitizer Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 at 3166 cm -1 , indicating the adsorption of Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 in the pores of the ImI-CMP-Co, which may result in poor CO 2 adsorption and slight decline of cyclic stability 52. To study the photoelectric properties of ImI-CMPs, photocurrent test is conducted (Fig. 3d).The ImI-CMPs photocathodes show high photocurrent (67 A cm -1 for ImI-CMPCo and 43 A cm -1 for ImI-CMP photoanode).The extremely high photocurrent shows a greatly 3d).These results show that ImI-CMPCo acts as a better photoelectrocatalyst with faster charge separation and transfer.Moreover, the photocurrents of the nonionic CMPCo are two orders of magnitude lower than ImI-CMP and ImI-CMPCo, indicating that the presence of imidazolium motifs is crucial for fast charge separation and transfer. To gain more mechanistic insights into the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 by ImI-CMPCo, we conduct spectroscopic characterization of the CMPs.The UV-vis absorption spectra of ImI-CMP and ImI-CMPCo show good UV and visible light ( 420 nm) absorption performance (Fig. 4a) 42.The intramolecular charge transfer behavior of ImI-CMP is investigated by solid-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved fluorescence decay techniques.The PL of ImI-CMPCo shows much weaker intensity than the ImI-CMP (Fig. 4b), illustrating that the existence of Co 2 can effectively prevent electron-hole recombination and quench the PL intensity.Thus the Co incorporation on ImI-CMP could enhance the electron transfer for the following photoreduction of CO 2 .The average fluorescence life expectancies of the ImI-CMP and ImI-CMPCo are 0.86 and 0.63 ns (Fig. 4c andd).The shorter life expectancies of the ImI-CMPCo can be attributed to the fast delivery of photogenerated electrons from the ImI-CMP to cobalt ions 11.Moreover, the PL decay spectra of the nonionic CMPs show much stronger PL intensity (Figs.S19 andS20), which suggests a weak ability of the nonionic CMP to suppress the recombination of excited state 42.Nanosecond transient absorption (TA) spectroscopic studies are also carried out on the CMPs to further explore the photophysics of the system.The TA spectroscopy of the ImI-CMP and ImI-CMPCo are conducted at 355 nm to reflect the degradation on the exciton and charge carrier dynamics in real time 53.The spectrum of ImI-CMP is fitted with 1 75 ns (52) and 2 348 ns (48).ImI-CMPCo is fitted with 1 188 ns (41) and 2 1480 ns (59), indicating the generation of a much longer lifetime of photogenerated carriers on the surface of ImI-CMPCo (Fig. 4e).The significantly prolonged lifetime and the larger proportion of 2 demonstrate that the separation of electron-hole pairs is greatly promoted after the incorporation of Co 10,52.The efficient electron transfer is important for the photoreduction reactions 11,54.All the above results reveal that ImI-CMPCo is favorable for promoting photogenerated electron transfer during the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction process.This in turn endows ImI-CMPCo with high photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity 11. The Mott-Schottky plots are measured at three frequencies (Figs.4f andS21).The positive slopes of the curves indicate that the ImI-CMP is a typical n-type semiconductor 55.The flat band potentials of ImI-CMPCo is approximately -1.48 V vs Ag/AgCl (ImI-CMPCo) at pH 7.The following equation is used to convert the obtained potential (vs.Ag/AgCl) to NHE at pH 7 56. Hence ImI-CMPCo have enough negative potential to enable the reduction of CO 2 to CO (-0.53 V vs NHE at pH 7) 27.By contrast, the flat band potentials of nonionic CMP and nonionic CMPCo are -0.22V and -0.36 V (Figs.S22 andS23), which are too low to reduce CO 2 .These results are well consistent with the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction results. Together, these spectroscopic and DFT results above point to a possible mechanistic pathway for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 over ImI-CMPCo (Fig. 5).CO 2 is first concentrated around the imidazolium motif inside the pores.Upon light irradiation, Ru (bpy) 3 2 is converted to the excited state Ru(bpy) 3 2 .Then the photogenerated electrons are transferred to the ImI-CMP and the TEOA consumes the produced holes 35,42.Meanwhile, intramolecular charge transfer occurs inside the ImI-CMP with the effect of built-in electric field.The electron-rich TEPM segment acts as an electron donor.The positively BPIB segment with imidazolium cations is electron-deficient and acts as an electron acceptor 23.The photoexcited electrons on the TEPM segment then transfer to the BPIB segment in the built-in electric field with alkynyl as a bridge 28 between the imidazolium cation and CO 2 - changes the active intermediate from the high-energy CO 2 - ion radical to an imidazolium CO 2 - complex 3,4,20,23.The linear C--O--C bond angle is bent when ion pairing occurs at the interface of the ImI-CMP 4.This complex intermediate then undergo reduction to form CO, which is then released from the ImI-CMP surface, regenerating the uncomplexed imidazolium cation in the catalytic cycle.This cascaded electron pathway enables oriented electron delivery from the ImI-CMPs to metal sites and achieves an efficient system for CO 2 photoreduction 28."}], "lamp": [{"llm generation": "Xenon", "source": "Then, the mixture was irradiated by a 300 W Xe lamp ( 420 nm) and stirred during photocatalytic reaction.", "context": "All reagents were supplied by commercial company.Tetrakis-(triphenylphosphine) palladium(0), CuI were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.1,3-bis(4-bromophenyl)-1H-imidazol-3-ium bromide was purchased from Jilin Chinese Academy of Sciences -Yanshen Technology Co., Ltd.Nafion solution (5 wt), tris(2,2 -bipyridine)ruthenium dichloride were purchased from Macklin Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.Tetrakis(4-ethynylphenyl) methane was purchased from Shanghai Kylpharm Co., Ltd.Cobalt acetate tetrahydrate (Co(OAc) 2 4H 2 O), triethanolamine (TEOA), acetonitrile (CH 3 CN), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), acetone, tetrahydrofuran, sodium bromide were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.All above reagents were used without further purification.

To verify this design concept, the corresponding experiments are carried out based on the simulated results above.This ImI-CMP is first synthesized through the combination of ionic linkers and neutral knots via Sonogashira-Hagihara cross-coupling reaction (Fig. 2a).TEPM is used as a neutral knot and BPIB as cationic linker for the construction of the ImI-CMP in which the cationic sites are exposed to the wall surface.This polymer network is designed to have a three-dimensional net structure arising from the four-pronged arylene-ethynylene linkages.The structure of the ImI-CMP is characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), solid-state cross polarization magic-angle spinning (CP-MAS) 13 C NMR, N 2 adsorption/desorption isotherms, powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and elemental analysis.The chemical structures of the obtained ImI-CMP are confirmed by FT-IR (Fig. S2).The peak at 2209 cm -1 of the ImI-CMP indicates the formation of -C ---Cbonds 31.The peak at 3284 cm -1 assigned to -C ---C-H in the TEPM disappears after the cross-coupling reaction, proving the total conversion of the precursor.ImI-CMP is extensively characterized using 13 C solid-state NMR (Fig. 2b).The peak located at 63.0 ppm is attributed to the quaternary carbon core of tetraphenyl methane.The peaks at 128.5 ppm and 143.2 ppm correspond to aromatic C-C and C-H sites, while the peaks at 75.4 ppm and 88.5 ppm belong to C(sp)-C(sp) and C (sp)-C(sp 2 ) sites 32.These also verify the successful synthesis of the ImI-CMP 15. The ImI-CMP exhibits a reversible type I isotherm in combination with type IV characteristics in N 2 adsorption-desorption analysis (Fig. 2c).The rapid increase at a relatively low-pressure range (below P/ P 0 0.01) indicates the permanent microporous nature of the ImI-CMP.The hysteresis loop in a higher relative pressure range could be attributed to the presence of mesopores.The pore-size distribution curve is shown in Fig. S3.Micropores and mesopores centered at 0.57 nm, 1.42 nm and 3.39 nm give a total pore volume of 0.583 cm 3 g -1 , in which the micropore volume is 0.078 cm 3 g -1 .It is calculated that the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of the ImI-CMP is 529 m 2 g -1 , in which the micropore surface area is 166 m 2 g -1 .The PXRD pattern shows that the obtained ImI-CMP is amorphous, without any crystalline phase or catalyst residues (Fig. S4).As cationic polymers face problems with chemical stability, we also investigate the thermal stability of the ImI-CMP by thermogravimetric testing (TG) 15.The ImI-CMP exhibits exceptional thermal stability and remains stable up to 320 C under an Ar atmosphere presumably due to the well-spaced charged groups within the three-dimensional network (Fig. S5).The slight weight loss below 200 C mostly results from the trapped solvent molecules in the pores.High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses are used to investigate the bulk-scale morphology of ImI-CMP (Fig. S6).As we can see from the HRTEM images, the ImI-CMP is highly microporous.SEM images indicate that the ImI-CMP forms 3D mesoporous networks composed of spherical particles with a size distribution centered at 20 nm.The distribution of the C/N/Br in the ImI-CMP are verified by elemental mapping under SEM mode (Fig. S7).Element analytical tests suggest that the contents of C, N, H and Br are 63.5, 6.0, 4.5 and 8.0, respectively.In addition, the nonionic CMP is also synthesized as comparison (Figs.S8 andS9). It was reported that the introduction of ionic surfaces in COFs can enhance the CO 2 affinity through dipole-quadruple interactions and the CO 2 adsorption isotherms of the ImI-CMP are measured up to 1 bar at 273 K and 298 K 22.The CO 2 adsorption isotherms display reversible adsorption capacity (Fig. 2d).When the actual pressure P of CO 2 approaches 760 mm Hg (P/P 0 1), the CO 2 uptake reach 82 mg g -1 and 41 mg g -1 at 273 K and 298 K, respectively 33,34.All of the trapped CO 2 can be totally released at P/P 0 0.The adsorption isosteric heat Q st calculated from the temperature-dependent CO 2 adsorption isotherms (273 K and 298 K) is in a narrow range (31-37 kJ mol -1 ) and decrease initially from 37 kJ mol -1 to 32 kJ mol -1 for CO 2 uptakes of 0.3-6 mg g -1 .It then remains steady for CO 2 uptakes up to 34 mg g -1 (Fig. 2e) 34.The Q st is much higher than most of the reported COFs, CMPs and MOFs, e.g., 22 kJ mol -1 for TpBpy-COF, 22 kJ mol -1 for Por-sp 2 c-COF, 25 kJ mol -1 for PCP-Cl and 27 kJ mol -1 for MFM-300 (In)-t.15,353637.The high Q st can be evidence of the strong electrostatic interactions between CO 2 molecules and the charged skeletons along with the ionic surface within the pores 15. To evaluate CO 2 chemisorption on the ImI-CMP, CO 2 -temperature programmed desorption (CO 2 -TPD) experiment is performed (Fig. 2f).The TPD curve shows two CO 2 desorption peaks at 50-130 C and 160-280 C. Apart from the weakly adsorbed CO 2 below 100 C, desorption around 160-280 C can be associated with CO 2 molecules that are strongly adsorbed on the ImI-CMP 38.In contrast, the TPD curve of the nonionic CMP shows no CO 2 desorption at temperatures up to 320 C (Fig. S10).These results indicate that the chemisorption of CO 2 in the ImI-CMPs mainly occurs on the imidazolium motifs.The simulation in MAPS was used to further study the CO 2 adsorption behavior visually in the ImI-CMP.The porous structure leaves enough space between cationic sites which enables the accessibility of the cationic sites by CO 2 molecules 22.The microporosity of this ImI-CMP stems from the rigid but contorted backbone 39.The distribution of CO 2 adsorbed on ImI-CMP obtained from the Monte Carlo simulation at 273 K and 1 bar is shown in Fig. 2g.The density field for CO 2 in the ImI-CMP shows that the CO 2 molecules occupied the pores in the ImI-CMP.The porous structure of the ImI-CMP can enrich the adsorption of CO 2 40. Due to the high affinity of ImI-CMP to CO 2 and its excellent chemical stability, the photoreduction of CO 2 is conducted with ImI-CMPCo as the catalyst in 0.8 bar of CO 2 under visible light ( 420 nm).Co (II) has been recognized as one of the most active centers for adsorbing and activating CO 2 molecules and even for achieving photocatalytic CO 2 reduction 28,41,42.Here we synthesize the ImI-CMPCo from the ImI-CMP and cobalt acetate.The XPS spectrum shows the presence of C, N, O, and Co in ImI-CMPCo (Fig. S11a).The observed Co 2p 3/2 binding energy of 781.5 eV with a shakeup satellite at 786.5 eV in ImI-CMPCo is consistent with Co (II) indicating the successful loading of Co ions into ImI-CMP (Fig. S11b) 42.The N 1s signal of ImI-CMP and ImI-CMPCo can be deconvoluted into 3 peaks at 398.5, 399.6 and 401.2 eV, respectively (Fig. S11c andd).Particularly, the peak at 398.5 eV can relative to pyridinic-N in ImI-CMP and pyridinic-N/Co-N in ImI-CMPCo.The binding energy of 398.5 eV in ImI-CMPCo is much stronger than that in ImI-CMP, signifying the existence of Co -N bonds to anchor the metallic Co 2 43,44. For the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 (bpy 2,2 bipyridine) was used as a visible-light photosensitizer, and triethanolamine (TEOA) was adopted as an electron donor.CO and H 2 are detected as the main products (Figs.3a andb andS12).ImI-CMPCo exhibits excellent activity with a CO production rate of 2953 mol g -1 h -1 and a turnover frequency (TOF) of 30.8 h -1 in 35 min 11,42.The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) at 420 nm is calculated to be 0.52 (Xe lamp current 15 A, light intensity 34.6 mW cm -2 , 10 mg ImI-CMPCo catalyst).The CO production rate and TOF for CO evolution in 3.5 h remain high at 1884 mol g -1 h -1 and 19.5 h -1 , which far outstrip the ImI-CMP (Fig. 3a).The TOF and CO production rate are competitive to the state-of-art porous photocatalysts (Table S2).Other examples include a CO production rate of 1020 mol g -1 h -1 (TOF 0.55 h -1 in 4 h) for DQTP COF-Co 42, 1213.33 mol g -1 h -1 in 1 h for CMP-BT 45, 2274 mol g -1 h -1 (TOF 3.71 h -1 in 5 h) for N-CP-D 28, 469 mol g -1 h -1 in 4 h for CNU-BA 46.To identify the function of the imidazolium motifs in the ImI-CMP in improving the photoreduction of CO 2 to CO, the CMP without imidazolium motifs (Fig. 3a) is also employed in the catalytic reaction.Under identical reaction conditions, the CO production rate was much lower with nonionic CMPCo as the catalyst, indicating the key role of imidazolium motifs in the photocatalytic reaction 3,4,20,23. The simultaneous production of CO and H 2 (syngas) with fixed CO/ H 2 ratios has been considered very useful, which can be subsequently utilized in achieving value-added feedstocks through following thermochemical processes, e.g., Fisher-Tropsch process and methanol synthesis reactions 47,48.The conventional approaches to syngas are based on reforming non-renewable fossil fuels (e.g., coal, petroleum coke and natural gas) operating at high temperatures of 800-1000 C and pressures of 5-40 bar 484950.While the CO/H 2 ratio is very important for controlling the different downstream products selectivity, producing the desired CO/H 2 ratio with CO 2 as a feedstock is still challenging 47.Interestingly, the n(H 2 )/n(CO) in this photocatalytic CO 2 reduction process by the ImI-CMPCo keeps 2 (Figs.3b andS12), which is a proper proportion exclusively for methanol production 495051. A series of control experiments are performed to identify the key factors for CO 2 -to-CO conversion (Fig. 3b).When photocatalytic experiments are performed with N 2 instead of CO 2 under the same reaction conditions, CO was not detected (Fig. 3b), which preliminarily proves that CO originates from CO 2 .No CO is detected under the conditions without light irradiation or in the absence of photosensitizer and triethanolamine.These indicate the necessity for light, photosensitizer and triethanolamine in the CO 2 reduction process.To further confirm the origin of the CO, isotope-labeled carbon dioxide ( 13 CO 2 ) is employed as a substitute source gas on a GC-MS system 28. 13CO is observed in the gas chromatogram and mass spectrum (a peak at m/z 29) (Fig. 3c).These results demonstrate that the carbon source of the formed CO was CO 2 .In addition, the amount of photosensitizer, solvent proportion and the sacrificial agent type also affect the rate of CO 2 reduction to some extent (Figs.S13 and14).The stability of ImI-CMPCo is examined by running the experiments over 140 min for five cycles (Fig. S15).We also tested CO production over a longer period of time of 385 min, which shows constant photocatalytic activity (Fig. S16).The test demonstrates that the catalyst has good stability during the photocatalytic reactions.In addition, there is no obvious change in catalyst structures and morphology as observed in the SEM images of the ImI-CMPCo before and after reaction (Fig. S17).In addition to SEM, we used FT-IR test before and after the catalytic reaction to characterize its chemical stability (Fig. S18).The FT-IR spectrum of the catalyst after reaction shows the additional peak of the photosensitizer Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 at 3166 cm -1 , indicating the adsorption of Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 in the pores of the ImI-CMP-Co, which may result in poor CO 2 adsorption and slight decline of cyclic stability 52. To study the photoelectric properties of ImI-CMPs, photocurrent test is conducted (Fig. 3d).The ImI-CMPs photocathodes show high photocurrent (67 A cm -1 for ImI-CMPCo and 43 A cm -1 for ImI-CMP photoanode).The extremely high photocurrent shows a greatly 3d).These results show that ImI-CMPCo acts as a better photoelectrocatalyst with faster charge separation and transfer.Moreover, the photocurrents of the nonionic CMPCo are two orders of magnitude lower than ImI-CMP and ImI-CMPCo, indicating that the presence of imidazolium motifs is crucial for fast charge separation and transfer. To gain more mechanistic insights into the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 by ImI-CMPCo, we conduct spectroscopic characterization of the CMPs.The UV-vis absorption spectra of ImI-CMP and ImI-CMPCo show good UV and visible light ( 420 nm) absorption performance (Fig. 4a) 42.The intramolecular charge transfer behavior of ImI-CMP is investigated by solid-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved fluorescence decay techniques.The PL of ImI-CMPCo shows much weaker intensity than the ImI-CMP (Fig. 4b), illustrating that the existence of Co 2 can effectively prevent electron-hole recombination and quench the PL intensity.Thus the Co incorporation on ImI-CMP could enhance the electron transfer for the following photoreduction of CO 2 .The average fluorescence life expectancies of the ImI-CMP and ImI-CMPCo are 0.86 and 0.63 ns (Fig. 4c andd).The shorter life expectancies of the ImI-CMPCo can be attributed to the fast delivery of photogenerated electrons from the ImI-CMP to cobalt ions 11.Moreover, the PL decay spectra of the nonionic CMPs show much stronger PL intensity (Figs.S19 andS20), which suggests a weak ability of the nonionic CMP to suppress the recombination of excited state 42.Nanosecond transient absorption (TA) spectroscopic studies are also carried out on the CMPs to further explore the photophysics of the system.The TA spectroscopy of the ImI-CMP and ImI-CMPCo are conducted at 355 nm to reflect the degradation on the exciton and charge carrier dynamics in real time 53.The spectrum of ImI-CMP is fitted with 1 75 ns (52) and 2 348 ns (48).ImI-CMPCo is fitted with 1 188 ns (41) and 2 1480 ns (59), indicating the generation of a much longer lifetime of photogenerated carriers on the surface of ImI-CMPCo (Fig. 4e).The significantly prolonged lifetime and the larger proportion of 2 demonstrate that the separation of electron-hole pairs is greatly promoted after the incorporation of Co 10,52.The efficient electron transfer is important for the photoreduction reactions 11,54.All the above results reveal that ImI-CMPCo is favorable for promoting photogenerated electron transfer during the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction process.This in turn endows ImI-CMPCo with high photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity 11. The Mott-Schottky plots are measured at three frequencies (Figs.4f andS21).The positive slopes of the curves indicate that the ImI-CMP is a typical n-type semiconductor 55.The flat band potentials of ImI-CMPCo is approximately -1.48 V vs Ag/AgCl (ImI-CMPCo) at pH 7.The following equation is used to convert the obtained potential (vs.Ag/AgCl) to NHE at pH 7 56. Hence ImI-CMPCo have enough negative potential to enable the reduction of CO 2 to CO (-0.53 V vs NHE at pH 7) 27.By contrast, the flat band potentials of nonionic CMP and nonionic CMPCo are -0.22V and -0.36 V (Figs.S22 andS23), which are too low to reduce CO 2 .These results are well consistent with the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction results. Together, these spectroscopic and DFT results above point to a possible mechanistic pathway for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 over ImI-CMPCo (Fig. 5).CO 2 is first concentrated around the imidazolium motif inside the pores.Upon light irradiation, Ru (bpy) 3 2 is converted to the excited state Ru(bpy) 3 2 .Then the photogenerated electrons are transferred to the ImI-CMP and the TEOA consumes the produced holes 35,42.Meanwhile, intramolecular charge transfer occurs inside the ImI-CMP with the effect of built-in electric field.The electron-rich TEPM segment acts as an electron donor.The positively BPIB segment with imidazolium cations is electron-deficient and acts as an electron acceptor 23.The photoexcited electrons on the TEPM segment then transfer to the BPIB segment in the built-in electric field with alkynyl as a bridge 28 between the imidazolium cation and CO 2 - changes the active intermediate from the high-energy CO 2 - ion radical to an imidazolium CO 2 - complex 3,4,20,23.The linear C--O--C bond angle is bent when ion pairing occurs at the interface of the ImI-CMP 4.This complex intermediate then undergo reduction to form CO, which is then released from the ImI-CMP surface, regenerating the uncomplexed imidazolium cation in the catalytic cycle.This cascaded electron pathway enables oriented electron delivery from the ImI-CMPs to metal sites and achieves an efficient system for CO 2 photoreduction 28."}], "reaction medium": [{"llm generation": "Liquid", "source": "A mixed solution of MeCN and TEOA (4:1, 100 mL) containing ImI-CMPCo (10 mg) and Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 (30 mg) was put in the container.", "context": "All reagents were supplied by commercial company.Tetrakis-(triphenylphosphine) palladium(0), CuI were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.1,3-bis(4-bromophenyl)-1H-imidazol-3-ium bromide was purchased from Jilin Chinese Academy of Sciences -Yanshen Technology Co., Ltd.Nafion solution (5 wt), tris(2,2 -bipyridine)ruthenium dichloride were purchased from Macklin Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.Tetrakis(4-ethynylphenyl) methane was purchased from Shanghai Kylpharm Co., Ltd.Cobalt acetate tetrahydrate (Co(OAc) 2 4H 2 O), triethanolamine (TEOA), acetonitrile (CH 3 CN), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), acetone, tetrahydrofuran, sodium bromide were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.All above reagents were used without further purification.
