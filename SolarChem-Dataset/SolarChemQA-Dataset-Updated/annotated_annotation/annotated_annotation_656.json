Synthesis of MoP/CN: The solution contained 50 mL deionized water, 0.5 g CN and a quantity of MoP were sonicated for 2 h and stirred vigorously overnight.Then the solution was dried at 80 C and the resulting products were calcined in Ar atmosphere at 350 C for 2 h.Finally, the MoP/CN composites were obtained and denoted as MoP/CN-x, where x (x 5, 10, 15, 20) represented the mass percentage of MoP. Photoelectrochemical measurements were proceeded on a standard three-electrode (CHI 660E, Chenhua, China).The working electrode was the FTO glass deposited catalysts while the counter electrode and reference electrode were Pt and Ag/AgCl, respectively.The electrolyte solution was 0.5 M Na 2 SO 4 solution.The working electrode was prepared as follows: CN and MoP/CN-15 were dispersed in 1 mL ethanol contained 20 lL nafion aqueous solution (5 wt), respectively, with ultrasonically treatment for 2 h.In succession, the resulting suspension was added dropwise on the FTO glass (1 cm 2 ) and evaporated to dry.The cyclic voltammetry (CV) was measured in 1.0 M KOH solution without illumination.

DFT calculations were carried out by exploiting the DMol3 codes that are included into Materials Studio 7.0 software.The (0 0 1) surface of CN and MoP that widely studied before was chosen for the theoretical computation in this paper 19,20,282930.For the geometry optimization and total energy calculation, conventional generalized gradient approximation (GGA) method with the Perdew-Burke-Eznerhof (PBE) exchange-correlation functional was applied.The k-points were adopted in 2 A 2 A 1 Monkhorst-Pack grid, and the DFT-D2 was chosen for the dispersion correction.DFT Semi-core Pseudopots (DSPP) pseudopotential was employed to treat the core electrons and the real space cutoff radius was maintained as 4.4 A.The vacuum space perpendicular was around 30 A, which was large enough to avoid the interaction between periodic images.The convergence criteria for energy was 1 A 10 A5 Ha while it for displacement of geometry optimization was 5 A 10 A3 A. The photocatalytic performance for CO 2 reduction and H 2 production were performed at Labsolar-6A system (Perfect Light Co., China) using a 300 W Xenon-arc lamp with a 3 AM 1.5 G filter to simulate sunlight irradiation.The 0.5 wt Pt /CN was synthesized by the in situ photodeposition method using H 2 PtCl 6 as the starting material.For a typical test in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, 50 mg photocatalyst was suspended in 100 mL deionized water.The obtained solution was vacuum-treated for 30 min under continuously stirring.Then the suspension was filled with CO 2 (99.999) at 100 kPa for 30 min to reach the equilibrium of adsorptiondesorption.After that the experiments began as the light was on.The photocatalytic H 2 production was conducted with a similar procedure except that the solution that contained 80 mL deionized water and 20 mL triethanolamine (TEOA) replacing the 100 mL deionized water and without CO 2 passed.The gas chromatograph (GC-2010 Plus, SHIMADZU, Japan) was used to test the products in our test.The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) at 420 nm (AE10 nm) wavelength was estimated via the following equation: 3. Results and discussion The XRD pattern of MoP is depicted in Fig. 1a.The main characteristic peaks can be assigned to the typical crystal facets of MoP (JCPDS PDF24-0771), which are in accordance with the previous reports 24.No impurity peaks are detected in the MoP, suggesting that a pure crystalline compound existed.For the MoP/CN composites in Fig. 1b, the peaks at 27.5and 13.1that belong to the (0 0 2) and (1 0 0) reflections of CN can be found in all the samples, indicating the interlayer-stacking of conjugated aromatic systems and in-plane tri-s-triazine units packing motif, respectively 31.With the increasing MoP content in the composites, the diffraction peaks of CN become broader and its intensity decreases gradually, whereas the diffraction peaks of MoP become stronger. The surface chemical compositions of the catalysts were further elucidated by XPS experiments.The survey scan XPS spectrum (Fig. S2y) reveals the co-existence of C, N, Mo and P elements in MoP/CN-15, which is also confirmed by the following EDX elemental mapping analysis.Furthermore, the spectra of O 1s also emerges due to the MoO x and absorbed gaseous oxygen molecules on the surface.What's more, the corresponding high-resolution XPS spectra were also investigated.As shown in Fig. 2a andb, the peaks of C 1s at 284.8 eV and 288.3 eV and the peaks of N 1s at 398.8 eV/400.6 eV/404.4eV confirm the presence of CN 32.The Mo 3d spectrum in Fig. 2c could be resolved into four peaks.The former peaks located at 228.2 eV and 231.6 eV are corresponding to the positively charged Mo in MoP (227.6 eV for Mo 0 ), while the rest of the Mo 3d peaks located at 232.2 eV and 235.4 eV are assigned to MoO x that formed by the passivation during the synthesis process 19,33,34.In Fig. 2d, the dominated peaks at 129.4 eV and 130.1 eV reveal the negatively charged P character in MoP (130.2 eV for P 0 ) 25.The peak at 133.9 eV represents the characteristic oxidation peak of phosphorous 353637. SEM and TEM images reveal the surface morphology and size of the catalysts.As depicted in Fig. S3y, the bulk g-C 3 N 4 without thermal exfoliation presents a typical lamellar structure with smooth surface and irregular curly edge.When the bulk g-C 3 N 4 was thermally treated, the hydrogen-bonds connecting the polymeric melon units in the layers are not stable enough against thermal oxidation process in air and the Van der Waals force between the layers will be broken 38.It is obvious that the CN exhibits a thin and porous flaky structure (Fig. S3y).As for the pure MoP in Fig. S3y, it is interesting to find there are two kinds of morphologies, fragmentized flake and agglomerated nanoparticles with some holes.The morphological characteristics was further verified by TEM observations.It can be seen that the sheet like MoP owns a great deal of pores with the diameter ranging in 50-80 nm (Fig. 3a), while the MoP nanoparticles even with some agglomerated clusters, possess the particle sizes ranging from 30 to 50 nm (Fig. 3b).For the hybrid MoP/CN-15 composite in Fig. S3y, a uniform flaky structure, inheriting the morphology of CN is observed, revealing that the MoP nanoparticles are intimately anchored onto the CN surface by the physical interaction and further calcination.The same conclusion can also be available for the TEM image in the inset image of Fig. 3c.Moreover, a HR-TEM image of local MoP/CN-15 in Fig. 3c shows a 0.280 nm interplanar spacing, corresponding to the (1 0 0) crystal plane of MoP 39,40.Furthermore, the EDX elemental mapping analysis was also conducted to verify the above conclusion.As shown in Fig. 3d ande, the C, N, P and Mo elements coexist in the hybrid catalyst, which further supports the uniform distribution of MoP.In addition, the surface morphology of MoP/ CN-20 composite was also investigated and the aggregated MoP particles on CN surface were detected (Fig. S4y). The specific surface areas and pore sizes of all samples were measured by N 2 adsorption-desorption to investigate the textural properties (Table S1.).As shown in Fig. 4a, all the samples display the type IV isotherms with H3 type hysteresis loops, indicating the existence of mesopore.Furthermore, the MoP/CN composites represent a visibly enhanced specific surface area of 88.5, 90.3, 95.1 and 93.6 m 2 /g with increasing MoP content while that for CN is only 69.4 m 2 /g.The increased specific surface area could provide more active sites for reaction.For proving this assumption, the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) of MoP/CN-15 was measured (Fig. S5y).Obviously, the capacitance of MoP/CN-15 with the value 59.44 mF/cm 2 is 1.57 times as high as that of CN (37.87 mF/cm 2 ) (Fig. 4b), which indicates a large surface area with more active sites emerges after the uniform doping of MoP on CN surface. CO 2 adsorption isotherms were also measured to analyze CO 2 adsorption capability quantificationally.As shown in Fig. 4c, all samples exhibit an increased uptake along with the elevated CO 2 pressure.Notably, the MoP/CN-15 composite displays a much higher CO 2 adsorption capacity than that of the pure CN and pure MoP.What's more, the optical absorption properties of the catalysts were also analyzed by UV-vis DRS.In Fig. 4d, the absorption edge of the pure CN is at 480 nm while the bare MoP shows a high absorption intensity throughout the UV and visible-light regions.For the MoP/CN composites, it can be seen that there is no obvious shift of the edge absorption, suggesting the coupling with MoP nanoparticles makes no effect on the structure of the CN.Moreover, the significantly enhanced visible-light absorption in MoP/ CN composites was observed due to the good optical absorption of MoP, which may be helpful for the photocatalytic reaction. To explore the influence of MoP in the hybrid MoP/CN composites, photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction and H 2 evolution under simulated light irradiation were conducted.Meanwhile, control experiments were conducted to distinguish whether the products containing C come from the C based photocatalyst or impurities.No hydrocarbon products are detected with N 2 flow instead of high-purity CO 2 , without illumination or photocatalyst, suggesting that CO 2 , light and photocatalysts are essential for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.As shown in Fig. 5a, CO is detected as the main product in photoreduction and only a trace amount of CH 4 produces.Moreover, O 2 as the oxidation product is also detected (Table S2y).It can be seen that all the MoP/CN composites exhibit significantly enhanced production while the pristine CN exhibits a low CO yield as a function of irradiation time.The CO yields of MoP/CN-15 increase to 5.51 lmol after 6 h illumination (Fig. 5b), which is almost 4.5 times higher than pure CN.The photocatalytic activities of H 2 production were also evaluated to confirm the role of MoP.It can be seen from Fig. 5c, a dramatically improved H 2 production is obtained as expected.Surprisingly, a maximum H 2 yields of 40.38 lmol h A1 is obtained on MoP/CN-15 catalyst, which is almost 75.5 times as high as pure CN.The AQE values of MoP/CN-15 catalyst for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction and H 2 evolution are 3.5 and 18.3 at 420 nm, respectively.What's more, the activity of the optimized photocatalyst is also compared with that of 0.5 wt Pt/CN, which is about 70 of the hydrogen production rate over 0.5 wt Pt loaded CN (57.66 lmol/h).However, the activity would decrease when further increase of MoP content.It may be ascribed to the decreased specific area and the blocked visible-light absorption on account of excessive MoP particles on CN surface.Besides that, the photocatalytic activity at per m 2 was also measured (Fig. S5y), which further confirms the realistic photocatalytic activity of MoP/CN detected above.Moreover, the H 2 evolution rate is much larger than that of CO 2 reduction because the initial activation of CO 2 and the intimate contact between photocatalyst and reactant in water splitting. The stability of the photocatalyts was evaluated through the cyclic test of photocatalytic H 2 evaluation on MoP/CN-15 catalyst.As shown in Fig. 5d, no observable activity decrease is observed through three recycling experiment over 15 h, implying the highstable photocatalytic characteristic of MoP/CN composites.Moreover, the SEM, TEM images and XRD patterns of the MoP/CN-15 photocatalyst before and after the photocatalytic CO 2 reaction and H 2 evolution were also measured to test its stability.The results show that no apparent structural changes appeared (Figs.S4y andS7y). It is generally accepted that the rapid separation and transfer of electron-hole pairs within a photocatalyst play a vital role in photocatalytic activity.Therefore, PL analysis was conducted to investigate the separation efficiency of photogenerated electron-hole pairs.As shown in Fig. 6a, CN has an intensive and broad emission peak centered at 440 nm, which is the typical band-band PL excitation that resulted from the n-p electronic transitions involving nitrogen atoms with lone pairs in CN 41.The PL emission of MoP/g-C 3 N 4 catalysts around at 440-450 nm is much weaker than that of CN, implying the efficient separation of electrons and holes.Obviously, MoP/CN-15 owns the lowest PL emission intensity, which is consistent with the excellent photocatalytic performance. Meanwhile, photocurrent and EIS experiment were also performed to illustrate the enhanced transfer of charges in the MoP/ CN catalysts.As illustrated in Fig. 6b, the uniform and fast photocurrent response appears in six light on-off cycles, indicating the stable charge transfer characteristic of the catalysts.It is easy to notice that MoP/CN-15 catalyst behaves the same characteristic of the carriers transfer with pure CN.The photocurrent exhibits a rapid increase when the light is on and a delayed decrease as the light is off, which may be ascribed to the gradual release of electrons from the doping channels 42.As expected, MoP/CN-15 composite exhibits a higher photocurrent intensity than pure CN, indicating the rapid charge transfer.Moreover, EIS experiment was also carried out to further verify the above conclusion.In Fig. 6c, MoP/CN-15 exhibits a smaller semicircle radius diameter than CN.It is generally accepted that a smaller semicircle radius means a lower resistance in charge transfer, as well as a faster electrons transfer in the hybrid composites 43.Thus the photocurrent response and EIS test show strong evidence of the accelerated electron transfer in MoP/CN-15 catalyst. Furthermore, the time-resolved PL decay spectra were studied to analyze the decay kinetics and the lifetime of photogenerated charge carriers quantitatively.As shown in Fig. 6d, the decay profiles of pure CN and MoP/CN-15 are fitted by a biexponential decay function with the fitting data in the inset.Obviously, the MoP/CN-15 sample exhibits the decreased short (s 1 ), long (s 2 ) and average lifetime (s), indicating that an additional electron decay pathway opens as MoP traps the electrons 44.This phenomenon suggests that more photogenerated carriers may aggregate on MoP/CN-15 and effortlessly captured by the reactants.The results provide a direct and quantified evidence for the PL and photoelectrochemical results discussed above. To further verify the above experimental results, the DFT calculation model for the MoP (0 0 1)/CN (0 0 1) heterojunction was established.The charge density difference was calculated with an isosurface of 0.02 e A A3 for better understanding the charge transfer process between CN and MoP.As shown in Fig. 7a andb, the difference charge density of the heterostructures is defined as follows: Dq 14 q hetero A q CN A q MoP 3 where q hetero , q CN and q MoP are the charge densities of the heterostructures and the isolated components.A general scheme of electron accumulation and depletion could provide insightful information about the charge migration.From the calculated results illustrated in Fig. 7a andb, a strong charge distribution occurs in the interface region of the MoP (0 0 1)/CN (0 0 1) due to the interaction of heterojunction, revealing a significant amount of charge transfer appears.Nonetheless, it is hardly to recognize where the charges deplete and accumulate within the established heterojunction interface.Thereby, the work function (W F ) of this concerned system was analyzed to help us to understand the origin of the charge transfer at the interface.In our calculations, W F for CN (0 0 1) in MoP (0 0 1)/CN (0 0 1) composite, calculated by aligning the Fermi level relative to the vacuum energy level, is found to be 4.73 eV, and for MoP (0 0 1) surface is 6.04 eV (vs.AVS) as shown in Fig. 7c.The results are close to the previous theoretical calculation 20,28293045.Therefore, the electrons will flow from CN to MoP due to the higher W F for MoP, indicating that MoP could act as an ideal electron-acceptor candidate in the composites for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction and water splitting, as depicted in Scheme 1. Combined with the experimental analysis and DFT calculations, the promotion mechanism of MoP co-catalyst on the photocatlytic activity of CN is evident. In succession, the FTIR study was carried out to monitor the CO 2 adsorption and conversion over the photocatalysts.As shown in Fig. 8a, monodentate carbonate (m-CO A2 3 , 1468 and 1539 cm A1 ), bidentate carbonate (b-CO A2 3 , 1329, 1362 and 1574 cm A1 ), carboxylate (CO A 2 , 1267, 1278 and 1678 cm A1 ) and bicarbonate (HCO A 3 , 1234, 1390 and 1424 cm A1 ) are found after the exposure to CO 2 and H 2 O without illumination.The peak at 1642 cm A1 assigned to H 2 O molecular is also emerged 46474849.After the illumination for 60 min, most peaks show minor enhancement with no obvious position changed.Moreover, a new peak at 1510 cm A1 assigned to COO A stretching appears and the peaks ascribing to dCH 2 (1488, 1495 and 1503 cm A1 ) also emerge.The phenomenon indicates a fact that the CO 2 conversion undergoes a multi-step process during the photocatalytic reduction.The intermediate products, such as HCOOH and HCHO, may convert into CO or CH 4 44,50,51.Moreover, the peaks for HCO A 3 and CO A 2 formed from CO 2 interaction with OH groups may be also the possible intermediates for CO 2 photoreduction, and it would decrease or even disappear while the peaks of surface H 2 O and CO A2 3 increase upon irradiation in the previous literatures 46,47,52.However, this phenomenon does not happen in our tests, and the peaks of HCO A 3 and CO A 2 species increase instead of decrease, revealing that HCO A 3 and CO A 2 species are continuously produced during the illumination, which makes for the formation of reduction products. Moreover, Mott-Schottky method was also applied to estimate the band energy levels and carrier densities.As shown in Fig. 8b, the negative slop in both pure CN and MoP/CN-15 indicates the n-type semiconductor characteristics.The flat potentials of CN and MoP/CN-15 are A1.07 and A1.05 V (vs. the Ag/AgCl), namely A0.87 and A0.85 V (vs.NHE) according to the Nernst equation 53.It is generally accepted that the value of the flat potentials of a ntype semiconductor is very close to (0-0.2 V more negative) that of the Fermi level 54,55.Therefore, the CB potentials for CN and MoP/CN-15 are about A1.07 eV and A1.05 eV, respectively.The VB potentials of that are calculated to be 1.58 and 1.45 eV on the basis of its band gaps, respectively.It is easily concluded that the band alignments of the MoP modified CN catalysts meet the requirement for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 and H 2 production.Moreover, it is noteworthy that the slope of MoP/CN-15 is smaller than CN, revealing the increased carrier densities according to the Mott-Schottky equation given as follows 56: where e 0; e; e 0 and N d are the electron charge, the dielectric constant of CN, the permittivity of vacuum and the electron donor density, respectively.With an e value of 3.2 for CN 57, the electrons donor densities of CN and MoP/CN-15 are calculated to be 4:87 A 10 19 cm A3 and 1:32 A 10 20 cm A3 , respectively. In summary, MoP nanoparticles were used as a novel cocatalyst to establish MoP/CN composites for photoreduction CO 2 and photosplitting water.The obtained MoP/CN-15 composite had the highest activity in both CO 2 photoreduction and H 2 production.A maximum CO and H 2 yields of 0.92 lmol h A1 and 40.38 lmol h A1 had been obtained on it, which were 5.5 and 75.5 times as high as pure CN.The corresponding AQE values for CO 2 reduction and H 2 production were 3.5 and 18.3 at 420 nm, respectively, considerably 70 of the hydrogen production rate over 0.5 wt Pt/CN (57.66 lmol h A1 ) under the same experimental conditions.The significant improvement of photocatalytic activity may be explained as follows: (i) the introduction of MoP could effectively separate the photoexcited charges from CN and facilitate the transfer of photogenerated electrons, which is also proven by the DFT calculation results; (ii) the doped MoP could enhance the visible-light absorption capacity; (iii) the introduction MoP nanoparticles increases the activated specific surface area.This study paves a new way to design cost-effective CN based photocatalysts.

The photocatalytic performance for CO 2 reduction and H 2 production were performed at Labsolar-6A system (Perfect Light Co., China) using a 300 W Xenon-arc lamp with a 3 AM 1.5 G filter to simulate sunlight irradiation.The 0.5 wt Pt /CN was synthesized by the in situ photodeposition method using H 2 PtCl 6 as the starting material.For a typical test in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, 50 mg photocatalyst was suspended in 100 mL deionized water.The obtained solution was vacuum-treated for 30 min under continuously stirring.Then the suspension was filled with CO 2 (99.999) at 100 kPa for 30 min to reach the equilibrium of adsorptiondesorption.After that the experiments began as the light was on.The photocatalytic H 2 production was conducted with a similar procedure except that the solution that contained 80 mL deionized water and 20 mL triethanolamine (TEOA) replacing the 100 mL deionized water and without CO 2 passed.The gas chromatograph (GC-2010 Plus, SHIMADZU, Japan) was used to test the products in our test.The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) at 420 nm (AE10 nm) wavelength was estimated via the following equation: 3. Results and discussion The XRD pattern of MoP is depicted in Fig. 1a.The main characteristic peaks can be assigned to the typical crystal facets of MoP (JCPDS PDF24-0771), which are in accordance with the previous reports 24.No impurity peaks are detected in the MoP, suggesting that a pure crystalline compound existed.For the MoP/CN composites in Fig. 1b, the peaks at 27.5and 13.1that belong to the (0 0 2) and (1 0 0) reflections of CN can be found in all the samples, indicating the interlayer-stacking of conjugated aromatic systems and in-plane tri-s-triazine units packing motif, respectively 31.With the increasing MoP content in the composites, the diffraction peaks of CN become broader and its intensity decreases gradually, whereas the diffraction peaks of MoP become stronger. The surface chemical compositions of the catalysts were further elucidated by XPS experiments.The survey scan XPS spectrum (Fig. S2y) reveals the co-existence of C, N, Mo and P elements in MoP/CN-15, which is also confirmed by the following EDX elemental mapping analysis.Furthermore, the spectra of O 1s also emerges due to the MoO x and absorbed gaseous oxygen molecules on the surface.What's more, the corresponding high-resolution XPS spectra were also investigated.As shown in Fig. 2a andb, the peaks of C 1s at 284.8 eV and 288.3 eV and the peaks of N 1s at 398.8 eV/400.6 eV/404.4eV confirm the presence of CN 32.The Mo 3d spectrum in Fig. 2c could be resolved into four peaks.The former peaks located at 228.2 eV and 231.6 eV are corresponding to the positively charged Mo in MoP (227.6 eV for Mo 0 ), while the rest of the Mo 3d peaks located at 232.2 eV and 235.4 eV are assigned to MoO x that formed by the passivation during the synthesis process 19,33,34.In Fig. 2d, the dominated peaks at 129.4 eV and 130.1 eV reveal the negatively charged P character in MoP (130.2 eV for P 0 ) 25.The peak at 133.9 eV represents the characteristic oxidation peak of phosphorous 353637. SEM and TEM images reveal the surface morphology and size of the catalysts.As depicted in Fig. S3y, the bulk g-C 3 N 4 without thermal exfoliation presents a typical lamellar structure with smooth surface and irregular curly edge.When the bulk g-C 3 N 4 was thermally treated, the hydrogen-bonds connecting the polymeric melon units in the layers are not stable enough against thermal oxidation process in air and the Van der Waals force between the layers will be broken 38.It is obvious that the CN exhibits a thin and porous flaky structure (Fig. S3y).As for the pure MoP in Fig. S3y, it is interesting to find there are two kinds of morphologies, fragmentized flake and agglomerated nanoparticles with some holes.The morphological characteristics was further verified by TEM observations.It can be seen that the sheet like MoP owns a great deal of pores with the diameter ranging in 50-80 nm (Fig. 3a), while the MoP nanoparticles even with some agglomerated clusters, possess the particle sizes ranging from 30 to 50 nm (Fig. 3b).For the hybrid MoP/CN-15 composite in Fig. S3y, a uniform flaky structure, inheriting the morphology of CN is observed, revealing that the MoP nanoparticles are intimately anchored onto the CN surface by the physical interaction and further calcination.The same conclusion can also be available for the TEM image in the inset image of Fig. 3c.Moreover, a HR-TEM image of local MoP/CN-15 in Fig. 3c shows a 0.280 nm interplanar spacing, corresponding to the (1 0 0) crystal plane of MoP 39,40.Furthermore, the EDX elemental mapping analysis was also conducted to verify the above conclusion.As shown in Fig. 3d ande, the C, N, P and Mo elements coexist in the hybrid catalyst, which further supports the uniform distribution of MoP.In addition, the surface morphology of MoP/ CN-20 composite was also investigated and the aggregated MoP particles on CN surface were detected (Fig. S4y). The specific surface areas and pore sizes of all samples were measured by N 2 adsorption-desorption to investigate the textural properties (Table S1.).As shown in Fig. 4a, all the samples display the type IV isotherms with H3 type hysteresis loops, indicating the existence of mesopore.Furthermore, the MoP/CN composites represent a visibly enhanced specific surface area of 88.5, 90.3, 95.1 and 93.6 m 2 /g with increasing MoP content while that for CN is only 69.4 m 2 /g.The increased specific surface area could provide more active sites for reaction.For proving this assumption, the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) of MoP/CN-15 was measured (Fig. S5y).Obviously, the capacitance of MoP/CN-15 with the value 59.44 mF/cm 2 is 1.57 times as high as that of CN (37.87 mF/cm 2 ) (Fig. 4b), which indicates a large surface area with more active sites emerges after the uniform doping of MoP on CN surface. CO 2 adsorption isotherms were also measured to analyze CO 2 adsorption capability quantificationally.As shown in Fig. 4c, all samples exhibit an increased uptake along with the elevated CO 2 pressure.Notably, the MoP/CN-15 composite displays a much higher CO 2 adsorption capacity than that of the pure CN and pure MoP.What's more, the optical absorption properties of the catalysts were also analyzed by UV-vis DRS.In Fig. 4d, the absorption edge of the pure CN is at 480 nm while the bare MoP shows a high absorption intensity throughout the UV and visible-light regions.For the MoP/CN composites, it can be seen that there is no obvious shift of the edge absorption, suggesting the coupling with MoP nanoparticles makes no effect on the structure of the CN.Moreover, the significantly enhanced visible-light absorption in MoP/ CN composites was observed due to the good optical absorption of MoP, which may be helpful for the photocatalytic reaction. To explore the influence of MoP in the hybrid MoP/CN composites, photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction and H 2 evolution under simulated light irradiation were conducted.Meanwhile, control experiments were conducted to distinguish whether the products containing C come from the C based photocatalyst or impurities.No hydrocarbon products are detected with N 2 flow instead of high-purity CO 2 , without illumination or photocatalyst, suggesting that CO 2 , light and photocatalysts are essential for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.As shown in Fig. 5a, CO is detected as the main product in photoreduction and only a trace amount of CH 4 produces.Moreover, O 2 as the oxidation product is also detected (Table S2y).It can be seen that all the MoP/CN composites exhibit significantly enhanced production while the pristine CN exhibits a low CO yield as a function of irradiation time.The CO yields of MoP/CN-15 increase to 5.51 lmol after 6 h illumination (Fig. 5b), which is almost 4.5 times higher than pure CN.The photocatalytic activities of H 2 production were also evaluated to confirm the role of MoP.It can be seen from Fig. 5c, a dramatically improved H 2 production is obtained as expected.Surprisingly, a maximum H 2 yields of 40.38 lmol h A1 is obtained on MoP/CN-15 catalyst, which is almost 75.5 times as high as pure CN.The AQE values of MoP/CN-15 catalyst for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction and H 2 evolution are 3.5 and 18.3 at 420 nm, respectively.What's more, the activity of the optimized photocatalyst is also compared with that of 0.5 wt Pt/CN, which is about 70 of the hydrogen production rate over 0.5 wt Pt loaded CN (57.66 lmol/h).However, the activity would decrease when further increase of MoP content.It may be ascribed to the decreased specific area and the blocked visible-light absorption on account of excessive MoP particles on CN surface.Besides that, the photocatalytic activity at per m 2 was also measured (Fig. S5y), which further confirms the realistic photocatalytic activity of MoP/CN detected above.Moreover, the H 2 evolution rate is much larger than that of CO 2 reduction because the initial activation of CO 2 and the intimate contact between photocatalyst and reactant in water splitting. The stability of the photocatalyts was evaluated through the cyclic test of photocatalytic H 2 evaluation on MoP/CN-15 catalyst.As shown in Fig. 5d, no observable activity decrease is observed through three recycling experiment over 15 h, implying the highstable photocatalytic characteristic of MoP/CN composites.Moreover, the SEM, TEM images and XRD patterns of the MoP/CN-15 photocatalyst before and after the photocatalytic CO 2 reaction and H 2 evolution were also measured to test its stability.The results show that no apparent structural changes appeared (Figs.S4y andS7y). It is generally accepted that the rapid separation and transfer of electron-hole pairs within a photocatalyst play a vital role in photocatalytic activity.Therefore, PL analysis was conducted to investigate the separation efficiency of photogenerated electron-hole pairs.As shown in Fig. 6a, CN has an intensive and broad emission peak centered at 440 nm, which is the typical band-band PL excitation that resulted from the n-p electronic transitions involving nitrogen atoms with lone pairs in CN 41.The PL emission of MoP/g-C 3 N 4 catalysts around at 440-450 nm is much weaker than that of CN, implying the efficient separation of electrons and holes.Obviously, MoP/CN-15 owns the lowest PL emission intensity, which is consistent with the excellent photocatalytic performance. Meanwhile, photocurrent and EIS experiment were also performed to illustrate the enhanced transfer of charges in the MoP/ CN catalysts.As illustrated in Fig. 6b, the uniform and fast photocurrent response appears in six light on-off cycles, indicating the stable charge transfer characteristic of the catalysts.It is easy to notice that MoP/CN-15 catalyst behaves the same characteristic of the carriers transfer with pure CN.The photocurrent exhibits a rapid increase when the light is on and a delayed decrease as the light is off, which may be ascribed to the gradual release of electrons from the doping channels 42.As expected, MoP/CN-15 composite exhibits a higher photocurrent intensity than pure CN, indicating the rapid charge transfer.Moreover, EIS experiment was also carried out to further verify the above conclusion.In Fig. 6c, MoP/CN-15 exhibits a smaller semicircle radius diameter than CN.It is generally accepted that a smaller semicircle radius means a lower resistance in charge transfer, as well as a faster electrons transfer in the hybrid composites 43.Thus the photocurrent response and EIS test show strong evidence of the accelerated electron transfer in MoP/CN-15 catalyst. Furthermore, the time-resolved PL decay spectra were studied to analyze the decay kinetics and the lifetime of photogenerated charge carriers quantitatively.As shown in Fig. 6d, the decay profiles of pure CN and MoP/CN-15 are fitted by a biexponential decay function with the fitting data in the inset.Obviously, the MoP/CN-15 sample exhibits the decreased short (s 1 ), long (s 2 ) and average lifetime (s), indicating that an additional electron decay pathway opens as MoP traps the electrons 44.This phenomenon suggests that more photogenerated carriers may aggregate on MoP/CN-15 and effortlessly captured by the reactants.The results provide a direct and quantified evidence for the PL and photoelectrochemical results discussed above. To further verify the above experimental results, the DFT calculation model for the MoP (0 0 1)/CN (0 0 1) heterojunction was established.The charge density difference was calculated with an isosurface of 0.02 e A A3 for better understanding the charge transfer process between CN and MoP.As shown in Fig. 7a andb, the difference charge density of the heterostructures is defined as follows: Dq 14 q hetero A q CN A q MoP 3 where q hetero , q CN and q MoP are the charge densities of the heterostructures and the isolated components.A general scheme of electron accumulation and depletion could provide insightful information about the charge migration.From the calculated results illustrated in Fig. 7a andb, a strong charge distribution occurs in the interface region of the MoP (0 0 1)/CN (0 0 1) due to the interaction of heterojunction, revealing a significant amount of charge transfer appears.Nonetheless, it is hardly to recognize where the charges deplete and accumulate within the established heterojunction interface.Thereby, the work function (W F ) of this concerned system was analyzed to help us to understand the origin of the charge transfer at the interface.In our calculations, W F for CN (0 0 1) in MoP (0 0 1)/CN (0 0 1) composite, calculated by aligning the Fermi level relative to the vacuum energy level, is found to be 4.73 eV, and for MoP (0 0 1) surface is 6.04 eV (vs.AVS) as shown in Fig. 7c.The results are close to the previous theoretical calculation 20,28293045.Therefore, the electrons will flow from CN to MoP due to the higher W F for MoP, indicating that MoP could act as an ideal electron-acceptor candidate in the composites for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction and water splitting, as depicted in Scheme 1. Combined with the experimental analysis and DFT calculations, the promotion mechanism of MoP co-catalyst on the photocatlytic activity of CN is evident. In succession, the FTIR study was carried out to monitor the CO 2 adsorption and conversion over the photocatalysts.As shown in Fig. 8a, monodentate carbonate (m-CO A2 3 , 1468 and 1539 cm A1 ), bidentate carbonate (b-CO A2 3 , 1329, 1362 and 1574 cm A1 ), carboxylate (CO A 2 , 1267, 1278 and 1678 cm A1 ) and bicarbonate (HCO A 3 , 1234, 1390 and 1424 cm A1 ) are found after the exposure to CO 2 and H 2 O without illumination.The peak at 1642 cm A1 assigned to H 2 O molecular is also emerged 46474849.After the illumination for 60 min, most peaks show minor enhancement with no obvious position changed.Moreover, a new peak at 1510 cm A1 assigned to COO A stretching appears and the peaks ascribing to dCH 2 (1488, 1495 and 1503 cm A1 ) also emerge.The phenomenon indicates a fact that the CO 2 conversion undergoes a multi-step process during the photocatalytic reduction.The intermediate products, such as HCOOH and HCHO, may convert into CO or CH 4 44,50,51.Moreover, the peaks for HCO A 3 and CO A 2 formed from CO 2 interaction with OH groups may be also the possible intermediates for CO 2 photoreduction, and it would decrease or even disappear while the peaks of surface H 2 O and CO A2 3 increase upon irradiation in the previous literatures 46,47,52.However, this phenomenon does not happen in our tests, and the peaks of HCO A 3 and CO A 2 species increase instead of decrease, revealing that HCO A 3 and CO A 2 species are continuously produced during the illumination, which makes for the formation of reduction products. Moreover, Mott-Schottky method was also applied to estimate the band energy levels and carrier densities.As shown in Fig. 8b, the negative slop in both pure CN and MoP/CN-15 indicates the n-type semiconductor characteristics.The flat potentials of CN and MoP/CN-15 are A1.07 and A1.05 V (vs. the Ag/AgCl), namely A0.87 and A0.85 V (vs.NHE) according to the Nernst equation 53.It is generally accepted that the value of the flat potentials of a ntype semiconductor is very close to (0-0.2 V more negative) that of the Fermi level 54,55.Therefore, the CB potentials for CN and MoP/CN-15 are about A1.07 eV and A1.05 eV, respectively.The VB potentials of that are calculated to be 1.58 and 1.45 eV on the basis of its band gaps, respectively.It is easily concluded that the band alignments of the MoP modified CN catalysts meet the requirement for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 and H 2 production.Moreover, it is noteworthy that the slope of MoP/CN-15 is smaller than CN, revealing the increased carrier densities according to the Mott-Schottky equation given as follows 56: where e 0; e; e 0 and N d are the electron charge, the dielectric constant of CN, the permittivity of vacuum and the electron donor density, respectively.With an e value of 3.2 for CN 57, the electrons donor densities of CN and MoP/CN-15 are calculated to be 4:87 A 10 19 cm A3 and 1:32 A 10 20 cm A3 , respectively. In summary, MoP nanoparticles were used as a novel cocatalyst to establish MoP/CN composites for photoreduction CO 2 and photosplitting water.The obtained MoP/CN-15 composite had the highest activity in both CO 2 photoreduction and H 2 production.A maximum CO and H 2 yields of 0.92 lmol h A1 and 40.38 lmol h A1 had been obtained on it, which were 5.5 and 75.5 times as high as pure CN.The corresponding AQE values for CO 2 reduction and H 2 production were 3.5 and 18.3 at 420 nm, respectively, considerably 70 of the hydrogen production rate over 0.5 wt Pt/CN (57.66 lmol h A1 ) under the same experimental conditions.The significant improvement of photocatalytic activity may be explained as follows: (i) the introduction of MoP could effectively separate the photoexcited charges from CN and facilitate the transfer of photogenerated electrons, which is also proven by the DFT calculation results; (ii) the doped MoP could enhance the visible-light absorption capacity; (iii) the introduction MoP nanoparticles increases the activated specific surface area.This study paves a new way to design cost-effective CN based photocatalysts.

Synthesis of g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets (CN) and MoP: CN was synthesized by thermal exfoliated bulk g-C 3 N 4 that obtained by the pyrolysis of urea as reported in our previous work 26.MoP was synthesized by typical temperature programmed reduction (TPR) method under H 2 atmosphere reported in a previous study 27. Synthesis of MoP/CN: The solution contained 50 mL deionized water, 0.5 g CN and a quantity of MoP were sonicated for 2 h and stirred vigorously overnight.Then the solution was dried at 80 C and the resulting products were calcined in Ar atmosphere at 350 C for 2 h.Finally, the MoP/CN composites were obtained and denoted as MoP/CN-x, where x (x 5, 10, 15, 20) represented the mass percentage of MoP. Photoelectrochemical measurements were proceeded on a standard three-electrode (CHI 660E, Chenhua, China).The working electrode was the FTO glass deposited catalysts while the counter electrode and reference electrode were Pt and Ag/AgCl, respectively.The electrolyte solution was 0.5 M Na 2 SO 4 solution.The working electrode was prepared as follows: CN and MoP/CN-15 were dispersed in 1 mL ethanol contained 20 lL nafion aqueous solution (5 wt), respectively, with ultrasonically treatment for 2 h.In succession, the resulting suspension was added dropwise on the FTO glass (1 cm 2 ) and evaporated to dry.The cyclic voltammetry (CV) was measured in 1.0 M KOH solution without illumination. In-situ Fourier transform Infrared spectroscopy(FTIR) was conducted to gain insights into the interaction of CO 2 and H 2 O vapor with the photocatalyst during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, as well as the conversion process of adsorption species and reaction intermediates during the reaction.The FTIR setup was descripted in Fig. S1y and the experiment was conducted as follows.Firstly, the catalyst was purged with Ar atmosphere at 200 C for 120 min to remove the residual water and other impurities on its surface.Secondly, the background spectrum was acquired when the temperature drops to 30 C and the first peak was acquired after that.Thirdly, the second peak was acquired after absorption of the CO 2 and H 2 O mixture vapor for 60 min.Finally, the light was on and the third peak was collected after illumination for 60 min. DFT calculations were carried out by exploiting the DMol3 codes that are included into Materials Studio 7.0 software.The (0 0 1) surface of CN and MoP that widely studied before was chosen for the theoretical computation in this paper 19,20,282930.For the geometry optimization and total energy calculation, conventional generalized gradient approximation (GGA) method with the Perdew-Burke-Eznerhof (PBE) exchange-correlation functional was applied.The k-points were adopted in 2 A 2 A 1 Monkhorst-Pack grid, and the DFT-D2 was chosen for the dispersion correction.DFT Semi-core Pseudopots (DSPP) pseudopotential was employed to treat the core electrons and the real space cutoff radius was maintained as 4.4 A.The vacuum space perpendicular was around 30 A, which was large enough to avoid the interaction between periodic images.The convergence criteria for energy was 1 A 10 A5 Ha while it for displacement of geometry optimization was 5 A 10 A3 A. The photocatalytic performance for CO 2 reduction and H 2 production were performed at Labsolar-6A system (Perfect Light Co., China) using a 300 W Xenon-arc lamp with a 3 AM 1.5 G filter to simulate sunlight irradiation.The 0.5 wt Pt /CN was synthesized by the in situ photodeposition method using H 2 PtCl 6 as the starting material.For a typical test in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, 50 mg photocatalyst was suspended in 100 mL deionized water.The obtained solution was vacuum-treated for 30 min under continuously stirring.Then the suspension was filled with CO 2 (99.999) at 100 kPa for 30 min to reach the equilibrium of adsorptiondesorption.After that the experiments began as the light was on.The photocatalytic H 2 production was conducted with a similar procedure except that the solution that contained 80 mL deionized water and 20 mL triethanolamine (TEOA) replacing the 100 mL deionized water and without CO 2 passed.The gas chromatograph (GC-2010 Plus, SHIMADZU, Japan) was used to test the products in our test.The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) at 420 nm (AE10 nm) wavelength was estimated via the following equation: 3. Results and discussion The XRD pattern of MoP is depicted in Fig. 1a.The main characteristic peaks can be assigned to the typical crystal facets of MoP (JCPDS PDF24-0771), which are in accordance with the previous reports 24.No impurity peaks are detected in the MoP, suggesting that a pure crystalline compound existed.For the MoP/CN composites in Fig. 1b, the peaks at 27.5and 13.1that belong to the (0 0 2) and (1 0 0) reflections of CN can be found in all the samples, indicating the interlayer-stacking of conjugated aromatic systems and in-plane tri-s-triazine units packing motif, respectively 31.With the increasing MoP content in the composites, the diffraction peaks of CN become broader and its intensity decreases gradually, whereas the diffraction peaks of MoP become stronger. The surface chemical compositions of the catalysts were further elucidated by XPS experiments.The survey scan XPS spectrum (Fig. S2y) reveals the co-existence of C, N, Mo and P elements in MoP/CN-15, which is also confirmed by the following EDX elemental mapping analysis.Furthermore, the spectra of O 1s also emerges due to the MoO x and absorbed gaseous oxygen molecules on the surface.What's more, the corresponding high-resolution XPS spectra were also investigated.As shown in Fig. 2a andb, the peaks of C 1s at 284.8 eV and 288.3 eV and the peaks of N 1s at 398.8 eV/400.6 eV/404.4eV confirm the presence of CN 32.The Mo 3d spectrum in Fig. 2c could be resolved into four peaks.The former peaks located at 228.2 eV and 231.6 eV are corresponding to the positively charged Mo in MoP (227.6 eV for Mo 0 ), while the rest of the Mo 3d peaks located at 232.2 eV and 235.4 eV are assigned to MoO x that formed by the passivation during the synthesis process 19,33,34.In Fig. 2d, the dominated peaks at 129.4 eV and 130.1 eV reveal the negatively charged P character in MoP (130.2 eV for P 0 ) 25.The peak at 133.9 eV represents the characteristic oxidation peak of phosphorous 353637. SEM and TEM images reveal the surface morphology and size of the catalysts.As depicted in Fig. S3y, the bulk g-C 3 N 4 without thermal exfoliation presents a typical lamellar structure with smooth surface and irregular curly edge.When the bulk g-C 3 N 4 was thermally treated, the hydrogen-bonds connecting the polymeric melon units in the layers are not stable enough against thermal oxidation process in air and the Van der Waals force between the layers will be broken 38.It is obvious that the CN exhibits a thin and porous flaky structure (Fig. S3y).As for the pure MoP in Fig. S3y, it is interesting to find there are two kinds of morphologies, fragmentized flake and agglomerated nanoparticles with some holes.The morphological characteristics was further verified by TEM observations.It can be seen that the sheet like MoP owns a great deal of pores with the diameter ranging in 50-80 nm (Fig. 3a), while the MoP nanoparticles even with some agglomerated clusters, possess the particle sizes ranging from 30 to 50 nm (Fig. 3b).For the hybrid MoP/CN-15 composite in Fig. S3y, a uniform flaky structure, inheriting the morphology of CN is observed, revealing that the MoP nanoparticles are intimately anchored onto the CN surface by the physical interaction and further calcination.The same conclusion can also be available for the TEM image in the inset image of Fig. 3c.Moreover, a HR-TEM image of local MoP/CN-15 in Fig. 3c shows a 0.280 nm interplanar spacing, corresponding to the (1 0 0) crystal plane of MoP 39,40.Furthermore, the EDX elemental mapping analysis was also conducted to verify the above conclusion.As shown in Fig. 3d ande, the C, N, P and Mo elements coexist in the hybrid catalyst, which further supports the uniform distribution of MoP.In addition, the surface morphology of MoP/ CN-20 composite was also investigated and the aggregated MoP particles on CN surface were detected (Fig. S4y). The specific surface areas and pore sizes of all samples were measured by N 2 adsorption-desorption to investigate the textural properties (Table S1.).As shown in Fig. 4a, all the samples display the type IV isotherms with H3 type hysteresis loops, indicating the existence of mesopore.Furthermore, the MoP/CN composites represent a visibly enhanced specific surface area of 88.5, 90.3, 95.1 and 93.6 m 2 /g with increasing MoP content while that for CN is only 69.4 m 2 /g.The increased specific surface area could provide more active sites for reaction.For proving this assumption, the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) of MoP/CN-15 was measured (Fig. S5y).Obviously, the capacitance of MoP/CN-15 with the value 59.44 mF/cm 2 is 1.57 times as high as that of CN (37.87 mF/cm 2 ) (Fig. 4b), which indicates a large surface area with more active sites emerges after the uniform doping of MoP on CN surface. CO 2 adsorption isotherms were also measured to analyze CO 2 adsorption capability quantificationally.As shown in Fig. 4c, all samples exhibit an increased uptake along with the elevated CO 2 pressure.Notably, the MoP/CN-15 composite displays a much higher CO 2 adsorption capacity than that of the pure CN and pure MoP.What's more, the optical absorption properties of the catalysts were also analyzed by UV-vis DRS.In Fig. 4d, the absorption edge of the pure CN is at 480 nm while the bare MoP shows a high absorption intensity throughout the UV and visible-light regions.For the MoP/CN composites, it can be seen that there is no obvious shift of the edge absorption, suggesting the coupling with MoP nanoparticles makes no effect on the structure of the CN.Moreover, the significantly enhanced visible-light absorption in MoP/ CN composites was observed due to the good optical absorption of MoP, which may be helpful for the photocatalytic reaction. To explore the influence of MoP in the hybrid MoP/CN composites, photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction and H 2 evolution under simulated light irradiation were conducted.Meanwhile, control experiments were conducted to distinguish whether the products containing C come from the C based photocatalyst or impurities.No hydrocarbon products are detected with N 2 flow instead of high-purity CO 2 , without illumination or photocatalyst, suggesting that CO 2 , light and photocatalysts are essential for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.As shown in Fig. 5a, CO is detected as the main product in photoreduction and only a trace amount of CH 4 produces.Moreover, O 2 as the oxidation product is also detected (Table S2y).It can be seen that all the MoP/CN composites exhibit significantly enhanced production while the pristine CN exhibits a low CO yield as a function of irradiation time.The CO yields of MoP/CN-15 increase to 5.51 lmol after 6 h illumination (Fig. 5b), which is almost 4.5 times higher than pure CN.The photocatalytic activities of H 2 production were also evaluated to confirm the role of MoP.It can be seen from Fig. 5c, a dramatically improved H 2 production is obtained as expected.Surprisingly, a maximum H 2 yields of 40.38 lmol h A1 is obtained on MoP/CN-15 catalyst, which is almost 75.5 times as high as pure CN.The AQE values of MoP/CN-15 catalyst for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction and H 2 evolution are 3.5 and 18.3 at 420 nm, respectively.What's more, the activity of the optimized photocatalyst is also compared with that of 0.5 wt Pt/CN, which is about 70 of the hydrogen production rate over 0.5 wt Pt loaded CN (57.66 lmol/h).However, the activity would decrease when further increase of MoP content.It may be ascribed to the decreased specific area and the blocked visible-light absorption on account of excessive MoP particles on CN surface.Besides that, the photocatalytic activity at per m 2 was also measured (Fig. S5y), which further confirms the realistic photocatalytic activity of MoP/CN detected above.Moreover, the H 2 evolution rate is much larger than that of CO 2 reduction because the initial activation of CO 2 and the intimate contact between photocatalyst and reactant in water splitting. The stability of the photocatalyts was evaluated through the cyclic test of photocatalytic H 2 evaluation on MoP/CN-15 catalyst.As shown in Fig. 5d, no observable activity decrease is observed through three recycling experiment over 15 h, implying the highstable photocatalytic characteristic of MoP/CN composites.Moreover, the SEM, TEM images and XRD patterns of the MoP/CN-15 photocatalyst before and after the photocatalytic CO 2 reaction and H 2 evolution were also measured to test its stability.The results show that no apparent structural changes appeared (Figs.S4y andS7y). It is generally accepted that the rapid separation and transfer of electron-hole pairs within a photocatalyst play a vital role in photocatalytic activity.Therefore, PL analysis was conducted to investigate the separation efficiency of photogenerated electron-hole pairs.As shown in Fig. 6a, CN has an intensive and broad emission peak centered at 440 nm, which is the typical band-band PL excitation that resulted from the n-p electronic transitions involving nitrogen atoms with lone pairs in CN 41.The PL emission of MoP/g-C 3 N 4 catalysts around at 440-450 nm is much weaker than that of CN, implying the efficient separation of electrons and holes.Obviously, MoP/CN-15 owns the lowest PL emission intensity, which is consistent with the excellent photocatalytic performance. Meanwhile, photocurrent and EIS experiment were also performed to illustrate the enhanced transfer of charges in the MoP/ CN catalysts.As illustrated in Fig. 6b, the uniform and fast photocurrent response appears in six light on-off cycles, indicating the stable charge transfer characteristic of the catalysts.It is easy to notice that MoP/CN-15 catalyst behaves the same characteristic of the carriers transfer with pure CN.The photocurrent exhibits a rapid increase when the light is on and a delayed decrease as the light is off, which may be ascribed to the gradual release of electrons from the doping channels 42.As expected, MoP/CN-15 composite exhibits a higher photocurrent intensity than pure CN, indicating the rapid charge transfer.Moreover, EIS experiment was also carried out to further verify the above conclusion.In Fig. 6c, MoP/CN-15 exhibits a smaller semicircle radius diameter than CN.It is generally accepted that a smaller semicircle radius means a lower resistance in charge transfer, as well as a faster electrons transfer in the hybrid composites 43.Thus the photocurrent response and EIS test show strong evidence of the accelerated electron transfer in MoP/CN-15 catalyst. Furthermore, the time-resolved PL decay spectra were studied to analyze the decay kinetics and the lifetime of photogenerated charge carriers quantitatively.As shown in Fig. 6d, the decay profiles of pure CN and MoP/CN-15 are fitted by a biexponential decay function with the fitting data in the inset.Obviously, the MoP/CN-15 sample exhibits the decreased short (s 1 ), long (s 2 ) and average lifetime (s), indicating that an additional electron decay pathway opens as MoP traps the electrons 44.This phenomenon suggests that more photogenerated carriers may aggregate on MoP/CN-15 and effortlessly captured by the reactants.The results provide a direct and quantified evidence for the PL and photoelectrochemical results discussed above. To further verify the above experimental results, the DFT calculation model for the MoP (0 0 1)/CN (0 0 1) heterojunction was established.The charge density difference was calculated with an isosurface of 0.02 e A A3 for better understanding the charge transfer process between CN and MoP.As shown in Fig. 7a andb, the difference charge density of the heterostructures is defined as follows: Dq 14 q hetero A q CN A q MoP 3 where q hetero , q CN and q MoP are the charge densities of the heterostructures and the isolated components.A general scheme of electron accumulation and depletion could provide insightful information about the charge migration.From the calculated results illustrated in Fig. 7a andb, a strong charge distribution occurs in the interface region of the MoP (0 0 1)/CN (0 0 1) due to the interaction of heterojunction, revealing a significant amount of charge transfer appears.Nonetheless, it is hardly to recognize where the charges deplete and accumulate within the established heterojunction interface.Thereby, the work function (W F ) of this concerned system was analyzed to help us to understand the origin of the charge transfer at the interface.In our calculations, W F for CN (0 0 1) in MoP (0 0 1)/CN (0 0 1) composite, calculated by aligning the Fermi level relative to the vacuum energy level, is found to be 4.73 eV, and for MoP (0 0 1) surface is 6.04 eV (vs.AVS) as shown in Fig. 7c.The results are close to the previous theoretical calculation 20,28293045.Therefore, the electrons will flow from CN to MoP due to the higher W F for MoP, indicating that MoP could act as an ideal electron-acceptor candidate in the composites for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction and water splitting, as depicted in Scheme 1. Combined with the experimental analysis and DFT calculations, the promotion mechanism of MoP co-catalyst on the photocatlytic activity of CN is evident. In succession, the FTIR study was carried out to monitor the CO 2 adsorption and conversion over the photocatalysts.As shown in Fig. 8a, monodentate carbonate (m-CO A2 3 , 1468 and 1539 cm A1 ), bidentate carbonate (b-CO A2 3 , 1329, 1362 and 1574 cm A1 ), carboxylate (CO A 2 , 1267, 1278 and 1678 cm A1 ) and bicarbonate (HCO A 3 , 1234, 1390 and 1424 cm A1 ) are found after the exposure to CO 2 and H 2 O without illumination.The peak at 1642 cm A1 assigned to H 2 O molecular is also emerged 46474849.After the illumination for 60 min, most peaks show minor enhancement with no obvious position changed.Moreover, a new peak at 1510 cm A1 assigned to COO A stretching appears and the peaks ascribing to dCH 2 (1488, 1495 and 1503 cm A1 ) also emerge.The phenomenon indicates a fact that the CO 2 conversion undergoes a multi-step process during the photocatalytic reduction.The intermediate products, such as HCOOH and HCHO, may convert into CO or CH 4 44,50,51.Moreover, the peaks for HCO A 3 and CO A 2 formed from CO 2 interaction with OH groups may be also the possible intermediates for CO 2 photoreduction, and it would decrease or even disappear while the peaks of surface H 2 O and CO A2 3 increase upon irradiation in the previous literatures 46,47,52.However, this phenomenon does not happen in our tests, and the peaks of HCO A 3 and CO A 2 species increase instead of decrease, revealing that HCO A 3 and CO A 2 species are continuously produced during the illumination, which makes for the formation of reduction products. Moreover, Mott-Schottky method was also applied to estimate the band energy levels and carrier densities.As shown in Fig. 8b, the negative slop in both pure CN and MoP/CN-15 indicates the n-type semiconductor characteristics.The flat potentials of CN and MoP/CN-15 are A1.07 and A1.05 V (vs. the Ag/AgCl), namely A0.87 and A0.85 V (vs.NHE) according to the Nernst equation 53.It is generally accepted that the value of the flat potentials of a ntype semiconductor is very close to (0-0.2 V more negative) that of the Fermi level 54,55.Therefore, the CB potentials for CN and MoP/CN-15 are about A1.07 eV and A1.05 eV, respectively.The VB potentials of that are calculated to be 1.58 and 1.45 eV on the basis of its band gaps, respectively.It is easily concluded that the band alignments of the MoP modified CN catalysts meet the requirement for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 and H 2 production.Moreover, it is noteworthy that the slope of MoP/CN-15 is smaller than CN, revealing the increased carrier densities according to the Mott-Schottky equation given as follows 56: where e 0; e; e 0 and N d are the electron charge, the dielectric constant of CN, the permittivity of vacuum and the electron donor density, respectively.With an e value of 3.2 for CN 57, the electrons donor densities of CN and MoP/CN-15 are calculated to be 4:87 A 10 19 cm A3 and 1:32 A 10 20 cm A3 , respectively. In summary, MoP nanoparticles were used as a novel cocatalyst to establish MoP/CN composites for photoreduction CO 2 and photosplitting water.The obtained MoP/CN-15 composite had the highest activity in both CO 2 photoreduction and H 2 production.A maximum CO and H 2 yields of 0.92 lmol h A1 and 40.38 lmol h A1 had been obtained on it, which were 5.5 and 75.5 times as high as pure CN.The corresponding AQE values for CO 2 reduction and H 2 production were 3.5 and 18.3 at 420 nm, respectively, considerably 70 of the hydrogen production rate over 0.5 wt Pt/CN (57.66 lmol h A1 ) under the same experimental conditions.The significant improvement of photocatalytic activity may be explained as follows: (i) the introduction of MoP could effectively separate the photoexcited charges from CN and facilitate the transfer of photogenerated electrons, which is also proven by the DFT calculation results; (ii) the doped MoP could enhance the visible-light absorption capacity; (iii) the introduction MoP nanoparticles increases the activated specific surface area.This study paves a new way to design cost-effective CN based photocatalysts.

Synthesis of g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets (CN) and MoP: CN was synthesized by thermal exfoliated bulk g-C 3 N 4 that obtained by the pyrolysis of urea as reported in our previous work 26.MoP was synthesized by typical temperature programmed reduction (TPR) method under H 2 atmosphere reported in a previous study 27. Synthesis of MoP/CN: The solution contained 50 mL deionized water, 0.5 g CN and a quantity of MoP were sonicated for 2 h and stirred vigorously overnight.Then the solution was dried at 80 C and the resulting products were calcined in Ar atmosphere at 350 C for 2 h.Finally, the MoP/CN composites were obtained and denoted as MoP/CN-x, where x (x 5, 10, 15, 20) represented the mass percentage of MoP. Photoelectrochemical measurements were proceeded on a standard three-electrode (CHI 660E, Chenhua, China).The working electrode was the FTO glass deposited catalysts while the counter electrode and reference electrode were Pt and Ag/AgCl, respectively.The electrolyte solution was 0.5 M Na 2 SO 4 solution.The working electrode was prepared as follows: CN and MoP/CN-15 were dispersed in 1 mL ethanol contained 20 lL nafion aqueous solution (5 wt), respectively, with ultrasonically treatment for 2 h.In succession, the resulting suspension was added dropwise on the FTO glass (1 cm 2 ) and evaporated to dry.The cyclic voltammetry (CV) was measured in 1.0 M KOH solution without illumination. In-situ Fourier transform Infrared spectroscopy(FTIR) was conducted to gain insights into the interaction of CO 2 and H 2 O vapor with the photocatalyst during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, as well as the conversion process of adsorption species and reaction intermediates during the reaction.The FTIR setup was descripted in Fig. S1y and the experiment was conducted as follows.Firstly, the catalyst was purged with Ar atmosphere at 200 C for 120 min to remove the residual water and other impurities on its surface.Secondly, the background spectrum was acquired when the temperature drops to 30 C and the first peak was acquired after that.Thirdly, the second peak was acquired after absorption of the CO 2 and H 2 O mixture vapor for 60 min.Finally, the light was on and the third peak was collected after illumination for 60 min. DFT calculations were carried out by exploiting the DMol3 codes that are included into Materials Studio 7.0 software.The (0 0 1) surface of CN and MoP that widely studied before was chosen for the theoretical computation in this paper 19,20,282930.For the geometry optimization and total energy calculation, conventional generalized gradient approximation (GGA) method with the Perdew-Burke-Eznerhof (PBE) exchange-correlation functional was applied.The k-points were adopted in 2 A 2 A 1 Monkhorst-Pack grid, and the DFT-D2 was chosen for the dispersion correction.DFT Semi-core Pseudopots (DSPP) pseudopotential was employed to treat the core electrons and the real space cutoff radius was maintained as 4.4 A.The vacuum space perpendicular was around 30 A, which was large enough to avoid the interaction between periodic images.The convergence criteria for energy was 1 A 10 A5 Ha while it for displacement of geometry optimization was 5 A 10 A3 A. The photocatalytic performance for CO 2 reduction and H 2 production were performed at Labsolar-6A system (Perfect Light Co., China) using a 300 W Xenon-arc lamp with a 3 AM 1.5 G filter to simulate sunlight irradiation.The 0.5 wt Pt /CN was synthesized by the in situ photodeposition method using H 2 PtCl 6 as the starting material.For a typical test in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, 50 mg photocatalyst was suspended in 100 mL deionized water.The obtained solution was vacuum-treated for 30 min under continuously stirring.Then the suspension was filled with CO 2 (99.999) at 100 kPa for 30 min to reach the equilibrium of adsorptiondesorption.After that the experiments began as the light was on.The photocatalytic H 2 production was conducted with a similar procedure except that the solution that contained 80 mL deionized water and 20 mL triethanolamine (TEOA) replacing the 100 mL deionized water and without CO 2 passed.The gas chromatograph (GC-2010 Plus, SHIMADZU, Japan) was used to test the products in our test.The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) at 420 nm (AE10 nm) wavelength was estimated via the following equation: 3. Results and discussion The XRD pattern of MoP is depicted in Fig. 1a.The main characteristic peaks can be assigned to the typical crystal facets of MoP (JCPDS PDF24-0771), which are in accordance with the previous reports 24.No impurity peaks are detected in the MoP, suggesting that a pure crystalline compound existed.For the MoP/CN composites in Fig. 1b, the peaks at 27.5and 13.1that belong to the (0 0 2) and (1 0 0) reflections of CN can be found in all the samples, indicating the interlayer-stacking of conjugated aromatic systems and in-plane tri-s-triazine units packing motif, respectively 31.With the increasing MoP content in the composites, the diffraction peaks of CN become broader and its intensity decreases gradually, whereas the diffraction peaks of MoP become stronger. The surface chemical compositions of the catalysts were further elucidated by XPS experiments.The survey scan XPS spectrum (Fig. S2y) reveals the co-existence of C, N, Mo and P elements in MoP/CN-15, which is also confirmed by the following EDX elemental mapping analysis.Furthermore, the spectra of O 1s also emerges due to the MoO x and absorbed gaseous oxygen molecules on the surface.What's more, the corresponding high-resolution XPS spectra were also investigated.As shown in Fig. 2a andb, the peaks of C 1s at 284.8 eV and 288.3 eV and the peaks of N 1s at 398.8 eV/400.6 eV/404.4eV confirm the presence of CN 32.The Mo 3d spectrum in Fig. 2c could be resolved into four peaks.The former peaks located at 228.2 eV and 231.6 eV are corresponding to the positively charged Mo in MoP (227.6 eV for Mo 0 ), while the rest of the Mo 3d peaks located at 232.2 eV and 235.4 eV are assigned to MoO x that formed by the passivation during the synthesis process 19,33,34.In Fig. 2d, the dominated peaks at 129.4 eV and 130.1 eV reveal the negatively charged P character in MoP (130.2 eV for P 0 ) 25.The peak at 133.9 eV represents the characteristic oxidation peak of phosphorous 353637. SEM and TEM images reveal the surface morphology and size of the catalysts.As depicted in Fig. S3y, the bulk g-C 3 N 4 without thermal exfoliation presents a typical lamellar structure with smooth surface and irregular curly edge.When the bulk g-C 3 N 4 was thermally treated, the hydrogen-bonds connecting the polymeric melon units in the layers are not stable enough against thermal oxidation process in air and the Van der Waals force between the layers will be broken 38.It is obvious that the CN exhibits a thin and porous flaky structure (Fig. S3y).As for the pure MoP in Fig. S3y, it is interesting to find there are two kinds of morphologies, fragmentized flake and agglomerated nanoparticles with some holes.The morphological characteristics was further verified by TEM observations.It can be seen that the sheet like MoP owns a great deal of pores with the diameter ranging in 50-80 nm (Fig. 3a), while the MoP nanoparticles even with some agglomerated clusters, possess the particle sizes ranging from 30 to 50 nm (Fig. 3b).For the hybrid MoP/CN-15 composite in Fig. S3y, a uniform flaky structure, inheriting the morphology of CN is observed, revealing that the MoP nanoparticles are intimately anchored onto the CN surface by the physical interaction and further calcination.The same conclusion can also be available for the TEM image in the inset image of Fig. 3c.Moreover, a HR-TEM image of local MoP/CN-15 in Fig. 3c shows a 0.280 nm interplanar spacing, corresponding to the (1 0 0) crystal plane of MoP 39,40.Furthermore, the EDX elemental mapping analysis was also conducted to verify the above conclusion.As shown in Fig. 3d ande, the C, N, P and Mo elements coexist in the hybrid catalyst, which further supports the uniform distribution of MoP.In addition, the surface morphology of MoP/ CN-20 composite was also investigated and the aggregated MoP particles on CN surface were detected (Fig. S4y). The specific surface areas and pore sizes of all samples were measured by N 2 adsorption-desorption to investigate the textural properties (Table S1.).As shown in Fig. 4a, all the samples display the type IV isotherms with H3 type hysteresis loops, indicating the existence of mesopore.Furthermore, the MoP/CN composites represent a visibly enhanced specific surface area of 88.5, 90.3, 95.1 and 93.6 m 2 /g with increasing MoP content while that for CN is only 69.4 m 2 /g.The increased specific surface area could provide more active sites for reaction.For proving this assumption, the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) of MoP/CN-15 was measured (Fig. S5y).Obviously, the capacitance of MoP/CN-15 with the value 59.44 mF/cm 2 is 1.57 times as high as that of CN (37.87 mF/cm 2 ) (Fig. 4b), which indicates a large surface area with more active sites emerges after the uniform doping of MoP on CN surface. CO 2 adsorption isotherms were also measured to analyze CO 2 adsorption capability quantificationally.As shown in Fig. 4c, all samples exhibit an increased uptake along with the elevated CO 2 pressure.Notably, the MoP/CN-15 composite displays a much higher CO 2 adsorption capacity than that of the pure CN and pure MoP.What's more, the optical absorption properties of the catalysts were also analyzed by UV-vis DRS.In Fig. 4d, the absorption edge of the pure CN is at 480 nm while the bare MoP shows a high absorption intensity throughout the UV and visible-light regions.For the MoP/CN composites, it can be seen that there is no obvious shift of the edge absorption, suggesting the coupling with MoP nanoparticles makes no effect on the structure of the CN.Moreover, the significantly enhanced visible-light absorption in MoP/ CN composites was observed due to the good optical absorption of MoP, which may be helpful for the photocatalytic reaction. To explore the influence of MoP in the hybrid MoP/CN composites, photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction and H 2 evolution under simulated light irradiation were conducted.Meanwhile, control experiments were conducted to distinguish whether the products containing C come from the C based photocatalyst or impurities.No hydrocarbon products are detected with N 2 flow instead of high-purity CO 2 , without illumination or photocatalyst, suggesting that CO 2 , light and photocatalysts are essential for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.As shown in Fig. 5a, CO is detected as the main product in photoreduction and only a trace amount of CH 4 produces.Moreover, O 2 as the oxidation product is also detected (Table S2y).It can be seen that all the MoP/CN composites exhibit significantly enhanced production while the pristine CN exhibits a low CO yield as a function of irradiation time.The CO yields of MoP/CN-15 increase to 5.51 lmol after 6 h illumination (Fig. 5b), which is almost 4.5 times higher than pure CN.The photocatalytic activities of H 2 production were also evaluated to confirm the role of MoP.It can be seen from Fig. 5c, a dramatically improved H 2 production is obtained as expected.Surprisingly, a maximum H 2 yields of 40.38 lmol h A1 is obtained on MoP/CN-15 catalyst, which is almost 75.5 times as high as pure CN.The AQE values of MoP/CN-15 catalyst for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction and H 2 evolution are 3.5 and 18.3 at 420 nm, respectively.What's more, the activity of the optimized photocatalyst is also compared with that of 0.5 wt Pt/CN, which is about 70 of the hydrogen production rate over 0.5 wt Pt loaded CN (57.66 lmol/h).However, the activity would decrease when further increase of MoP content.It may be ascribed to the decreased specific area and the blocked visible-light absorption on account of excessive MoP particles on CN surface.Besides that, the photocatalytic activity at per m 2 was also measured (Fig. S5y), which further confirms the realistic photocatalytic activity of MoP/CN detected above.Moreover, the H 2 evolution rate is much larger than that of CO 2 reduction because the initial activation of CO 2 and the intimate contact between photocatalyst and reactant in water splitting. The stability of the photocatalyts was evaluated through the cyclic test of photocatalytic H 2 evaluation on MoP/CN-15 catalyst.As shown in Fig. 5d, no observable activity decrease is observed through three recycling experiment over 15 h, implying the highstable photocatalytic characteristic of MoP/CN composites.Moreover, the SEM, TEM images and XRD patterns of the MoP/CN-15 photocatalyst before and after the photocatalytic CO 2 reaction and H 2 evolution were also measured to test its stability.The results show that no apparent structural changes appeared (Figs.S4y andS7y). It is generally accepted that the rapid separation and transfer of electron-hole pairs within a photocatalyst play a vital role in photocatalytic activity.Therefore, PL analysis was conducted to investigate the separation efficiency of photogenerated electron-hole pairs.As shown in Fig. 6a, CN has an intensive and broad emission peak centered at 440 nm, which is the typical band-band PL excitation that resulted from the n-p electronic transitions involving nitrogen atoms with lone pairs in CN 41.The PL emission of MoP/g-C 3 N 4 catalysts around at 440-450 nm is much weaker than that of CN, implying the efficient separation of electrons and holes.Obviously, MoP/CN-15 owns the lowest PL emission intensity, which is consistent with the excellent photocatalytic performance. Meanwhile, photocurrent and EIS experiment were also performed to illustrate the enhanced transfer of charges in the MoP/ CN catalysts.As illustrated in Fig. 6b, the uniform and fast photocurrent response appears in six light on-off cycles, indicating the stable charge transfer characteristic of the catalysts.It is easy to notice that MoP/CN-15 catalyst behaves the same characteristic of the carriers transfer with pure CN.The photocurrent exhibits a rapid increase when the light is on and a delayed decrease as the light is off, which may be ascribed to the gradual release of electrons from the doping channels 42.As expected, MoP/CN-15 composite exhibits a higher photocurrent intensity than pure CN, indicating the rapid charge transfer.Moreover, EIS experiment was also carried out to further verify the above conclusion.In Fig. 6c, MoP/CN-15 exhibits a smaller semicircle radius diameter than CN.It is generally accepted that a smaller semicircle radius means a lower resistance in charge transfer, as well as a faster electrons transfer in the hybrid composites 43.Thus the photocurrent response and EIS test show strong evidence of the accelerated electron transfer in MoP/CN-15 catalyst. Furthermore, the time-resolved PL decay spectra were studied to analyze the decay kinetics and the lifetime of photogenerated charge carriers quantitatively.As shown in Fig. 6d, the decay profiles of pure CN and MoP/CN-15 are fitted by a biexponential decay function with the fitting data in the inset.Obviously, the MoP/CN-15 sample exhibits the decreased short (s 1 ), long (s 2 ) and average lifetime (s), indicating that an additional electron decay pathway opens as MoP traps the electrons 44.This phenomenon suggests that more photogenerated carriers may aggregate on MoP/CN-15 and effortlessly captured by the reactants.The results provide a direct and quantified evidence for the PL and photoelectrochemical results discussed above. To further verify the above experimental results, the DFT calculation model for the MoP (0 0 1)/CN (0 0 1) heterojunction was established.The charge density difference was calculated with an isosurface of 0.02 e A A3 for better understanding the charge transfer process between CN and MoP.As shown in Fig. 7a andb, the difference charge density of the heterostructures is defined as follows: Dq 14 q hetero A q CN A q MoP 3 where q hetero , q CN and q MoP are the charge densities of the heterostructures and the isolated components.A general scheme of electron accumulation and depletion could provide insightful information about the charge migration.From the calculated results illustrated in Fig. 7a andb, a strong charge distribution occurs in the interface region of the MoP (0 0 1)/CN (0 0 1) due to the interaction of heterojunction, revealing a significant amount of charge transfer appears.Nonetheless, it is hardly to recognize where the charges deplete and accumulate within the established heterojunction interface.Thereby, the work function (W F ) of this concerned system was analyzed to help us to understand the origin of the charge transfer at the interface.In our calculations, W F for CN (0 0 1) in MoP (0 0 1)/CN (0 0 1) composite, calculated by aligning the Fermi level relative to the vacuum energy level, is found to be 4.73 eV, and for MoP (0 0 1) surface is 6.04 eV (vs.AVS) as shown in Fig. 7c.The results are close to the previous theoretical calculation 20,28293045.Therefore, the electrons will flow from CN to MoP due to the higher W F for MoP, indicating that MoP could act as an ideal electron-acceptor candidate in the composites for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction and water splitting, as depicted in Scheme 1. Combined with the experimental analysis and DFT calculations, the promotion mechanism of MoP co-catalyst on the photocatlytic activity of CN is evident. In succession, the FTIR study was carried out to monitor the CO 2 adsorption and conversion over the photocatalysts.As shown in Fig. 8a, monodentate carbonate (m-CO A2 3 , 1468 and 1539 cm A1 ), bidentate carbonate (b-CO A2 3 , 1329, 1362 and 1574 cm A1 ), carboxylate (CO A 2 , 1267, 1278 and 1678 cm A1 ) and bicarbonate (HCO A 3 , 1234, 1390 and 1424 cm A1 ) are found after the exposure to CO 2 and H 2 O without illumination.The peak at 1642 cm A1 assigned to H 2 O molecular is also emerged 46474849.After the illumination for 60 min, most peaks show minor enhancement with no obvious position changed.Moreover, a new peak at 1510 cm A1 assigned to COO A stretching appears and the peaks ascribing to dCH 2 (1488, 1495 and 1503 cm A1 ) also emerge.The phenomenon indicates a fact that the CO 2 conversion undergoes a multi-step process during the photocatalytic reduction.The intermediate products, such as HCOOH and HCHO, may convert into CO or CH 4 44,50,51.Moreover, the peaks for HCO A 3 and CO A 2 formed from CO 2 interaction with OH groups may be also the possible intermediates for CO 2 photoreduction, and it would decrease or even disappear while the peaks of surface H 2 O and CO A2 3 increase upon irradiation in the previous literatures 46,47,52.However, this phenomenon does not happen in our tests, and the peaks of HCO A 3 and CO A 2 species increase instead of decrease, revealing that HCO A 3 and CO A 2 species are continuously produced during the illumination, which makes for the formation of reduction products. Moreover, Mott-Schottky method was also applied to estimate the band energy levels and carrier densities.As shown in Fig. 8b, the negative slop in both pure CN and MoP/CN-15 indicates the n-type semiconductor characteristics.The flat potentials of CN and MoP/CN-15 are A1.07 and A1.05 V (vs. the Ag/AgCl), namely A0.87 and A0.85 V (vs.NHE) according to the Nernst equation 53.It is generally accepted that the value of the flat potentials of a ntype semiconductor is very close to (0-0.2 V more negative) that of the Fermi level 54,55.Therefore, the CB potentials for CN and MoP/CN-15 are about A1.07 eV and A1.05 eV, respectively.The VB potentials of that are calculated to be 1.58 and 1.45 eV on the basis of its band gaps, respectively.It is easily concluded that the band alignments of the MoP modified CN catalysts meet the requirement for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 and H 2 production.Moreover, it is noteworthy that the slope of MoP/CN-15 is smaller than CN, revealing the increased carrier densities according to the Mott-Schottky equation given as follows 56: where e 0; e; e 0 and N d are the electron charge, the dielectric constant of CN, the permittivity of vacuum and the electron donor density, respectively.With an e value of 3.2 for CN 57, the electrons donor densities of CN and MoP/CN-15 are calculated to be 4:87 A 10 19 cm A3 and 1:32 A 10 20 cm A3 , respectively. In summary, MoP nanoparticles were used as a novel cocatalyst to establish MoP/CN composites for photoreduction CO 2 and photosplitting water.The obtained MoP/CN-15 composite had the highest activity in both CO 2 photoreduction and H 2 production.A maximum CO and H 2 yields of 0.92 lmol h A1 and 40.38 lmol h A1 had been obtained on it, which were 5.5 and 75.5 times as high as pure CN.The corresponding AQE values for CO 2 reduction and H 2 production were 3.5 and 18.3 at 420 nm, respectively, considerably 70 of the hydrogen production rate over 0.5 wt Pt/CN (57.66 lmol h A1 ) under the same experimental conditions.The significant improvement of photocatalytic activity may be explained as follows: (i) the introduction of MoP could effectively separate the photoexcited charges from CN and facilitate the transfer of photogenerated electrons, which is also proven by the DFT calculation results; (ii) the doped MoP could enhance the visible-light absorption capacity; (iii) the introduction MoP nanoparticles increases the activated specific surface area.This study paves a new way to design cost-effective CN based photocatalysts.

The surface chemical compositions of the catalysts were further elucidated by XPS experiments.The survey scan XPS spectrum (Fig. S2y) reveals the co-existence of C, N, Mo and P elements in MoP/CN-15, which is also confirmed by the following EDX elemental mapping analysis.Furthermore, the spectra of O 1s also emerges due to the MoO x and absorbed gaseous oxygen molecules on the surface.What's more, the corresponding high-resolution XPS spectra were also investigated.As shown in Fig. 2a andb, the peaks of C 1s at 284.8 eV and 288.3 eV and the peaks of N 1s at 398.8 eV/400.6 eV/404.4eV confirm the presence of CN 32.The Mo 3d spectrum in Fig. 2c could be resolved into four peaks.The former peaks located at 228.2 eV and 231.6 eV are corresponding to the positively charged Mo in MoP (227.6 eV for Mo 0 ), while the rest of the Mo 3d peaks located at 232.2 eV and 235.4 eV are assigned to MoO x that formed by the passivation during the synthesis process 19,33,34.In Fig. 2d, the dominated peaks at 129.4 eV and 130.1 eV reveal the negatively charged P character in MoP (130.2 eV for P 0 ) 25.The peak at 133.9 eV represents the characteristic oxidation peak of phosphorous 353637. SEM and TEM images reveal the surface morphology and size of the catalysts.As depicted in Fig. S3y, the bulk g-C 3 N 4 without thermal exfoliation presents a typical lamellar structure with smooth surface and irregular curly edge.When the bulk g-C 3 N 4 was thermally treated, the hydrogen-bonds connecting the polymeric melon units in the layers are not stable enough against thermal oxidation process in air and the Van der Waals force between the layers will be broken 38.It is obvious that the CN exhibits a thin and porous flaky structure (Fig. S3y).As for the pure MoP in Fig. S3y, it is interesting to find there are two kinds of morphologies, fragmentized flake and agglomerated nanoparticles with some holes.The morphological characteristics was further verified by TEM observations.It can be seen that the sheet like MoP owns a great deal of pores with the diameter ranging in 50-80 nm (Fig. 3a), while the MoP nanoparticles even with some agglomerated clusters, possess the particle sizes ranging from 30 to 50 nm (Fig. 3b).For the hybrid MoP/CN-15 composite in Fig. S3y, a uniform flaky structure, inheriting the morphology of CN is observed, revealing that the MoP nanoparticles are intimately anchored onto the CN surface by the physical interaction and further calcination.The same conclusion can also be available for the TEM image in the inset image of Fig. 3c.Moreover, a HR-TEM image of local MoP/CN-15 in Fig. 3c shows a 0.280 nm interplanar spacing, corresponding to the (1 0 0) crystal plane of MoP 39,40.Furthermore, the EDX elemental mapping analysis was also conducted to verify the above conclusion.As shown in Fig. 3d ande, the C, N, P and Mo elements coexist in the hybrid catalyst, which further supports the uniform distribution of MoP.In addition, the surface morphology of MoP/ CN-20 composite was also investigated and the aggregated MoP particles on CN surface were detected (Fig. S4y). The specific surface areas and pore sizes of all samples were measured by N 2 adsorption-desorption to investigate the textural properties (Table S1.).As shown in Fig. 4a, all the samples display the type IV isotherms with H3 type hysteresis loops, indicating the existence of mesopore.Furthermore, the MoP/CN composites represent a visibly enhanced specific surface area of 88.5, 90.3, 95.1 and 93.6 m 2 /g with increasing MoP content while that for CN is only 69.4 m 2 /g.The increased specific surface area could provide more active sites for reaction.For proving this assumption, the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) of MoP/CN-15 was measured (Fig. S5y).Obviously, the capacitance of MoP/CN-15 with the value 59.44 mF/cm 2 is 1.57 times as high as that of CN (37.87 mF/cm 2 ) (Fig. 4b), which indicates a large surface area with more active sites emerges after the uniform doping of MoP on CN surface. CO 2 adsorption isotherms were also measured to analyze CO 2 adsorption capability quantificationally.As shown in Fig. 4c, all samples exhibit an increased uptake along with the elevated CO 2 pressure.Notably, the MoP/CN-15 composite displays a much higher CO 2 adsorption capacity than that of the pure CN and pure MoP.What's more, the optical absorption properties of the catalysts were also analyzed by UV-vis DRS.In Fig. 4d, the absorption edge of the pure CN is at 480 nm while the bare MoP shows a high absorption intensity throughout the UV and visible-light regions.For the MoP/CN composites, it can be seen that there is no obvious shift of the edge absorption, suggesting the coupling with MoP nanoparticles makes no effect on the structure of the CN.Moreover, the significantly enhanced visible-light absorption in MoP/ CN composites was observed due to the good optical absorption of MoP, which may be helpful for the photocatalytic reaction. To explore the influence of MoP in the hybrid MoP/CN composites, photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction and H 2 evolution under simulated light irradiation were conducted.Meanwhile, control experiments were conducted to distinguish whether the products containing C come from the C based photocatalyst or impurities.No hydrocarbon products are detected with N 2 flow instead of high-purity CO 2 , without illumination or photocatalyst, suggesting that CO 2 , light and photocatalysts are essential for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.As shown in Fig. 5a, CO is detected as the main product in photoreduction and only a trace amount of CH 4 produces.Moreover, O 2 as the oxidation product is also detected (Table S2y).It can be seen that all the MoP/CN composites exhibit significantly enhanced production while the pristine CN exhibits a low CO yield as a function of irradiation time.The CO yields of MoP/CN-15 increase to 5.51 lmol after 6 h illumination (Fig. 5b), which is almost 4.5 times higher than pure CN.The photocatalytic activities of H 2 production were also evaluated to confirm the role of MoP.It can be seen from Fig. 5c, a dramatically improved H 2 production is obtained as expected.Surprisingly, a maximum H 2 yields of 40.38 lmol h A1 is obtained on MoP/CN-15 catalyst, which is almost 75.5 times as high as pure CN.The AQE values of MoP/CN-15 catalyst for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction and H 2 evolution are 3.5 and 18.3 at 420 nm, respectively.What's more, the activity of the optimized photocatalyst is also compared with that of 0.5 wt Pt/CN, which is about 70 of the hydrogen production rate over 0.5 wt Pt loaded CN (57.66 lmol/h).However, the activity would decrease when further increase of MoP content.It may be ascribed to the decreased specific area and the blocked visible-light absorption on account of excessive MoP particles on CN surface.Besides that, the photocatalytic activity at per m 2 was also measured (Fig. S5y), which further confirms the realistic photocatalytic activity of MoP/CN detected above.Moreover, the H 2 evolution rate is much larger than that of CO 2 reduction because the initial activation of CO 2 and the intimate contact between photocatalyst and reactant in water splitting. The stability of the photocatalyts was evaluated through the cyclic test of photocatalytic H 2 evaluation on MoP/CN-15 catalyst.As shown in Fig. 5d, no observable activity decrease is observed through three recycling experiment over 15 h, implying the highstable photocatalytic characteristic of MoP/CN composites.Moreover, the SEM, TEM images and XRD patterns of the MoP/CN-15 photocatalyst before and after the photocatalytic CO 2 reaction and H 2 evolution were also measured to test its stability.The results show that no apparent structural changes appeared (Figs.S4y andS7y). It is generally accepted that the rapid separation and transfer of electron-hole pairs within a photocatalyst play a vital role in photocatalytic activity.Therefore, PL analysis was conducted to investigate the separation efficiency of photogenerated electron-hole pairs.As shown in Fig. 6a, CN has an intensive and broad emission peak centered at 440 nm, which is the typical band-band PL excitation that resulted from the n-p electronic transitions involving nitrogen atoms with lone pairs in CN 41.The PL emission of MoP/g-C 3 N 4 catalysts around at 440-450 nm is much weaker than that of CN, implying the efficient separation of electrons and holes.Obviously, MoP/CN-15 owns the lowest PL emission intensity, which is consistent with the excellent photocatalytic performance. Meanwhile, photocurrent and EIS experiment were also performed to illustrate the enhanced transfer of charges in the MoP/ CN catalysts.As illustrated in Fig. 6b, the uniform and fast photocurrent response appears in six light on-off cycles, indicating the stable charge transfer characteristic of the catalysts.It is easy to notice that MoP/CN-15 catalyst behaves the same characteristic of the carriers transfer with pure CN.The photocurrent exhibits a rapid increase when the light is on and a delayed decrease as the light is off, which may be ascribed to the gradual release of electrons from the doping channels 42.As expected, MoP/CN-15 composite exhibits a higher photocurrent intensity than pure CN, indicating the rapid charge transfer.Moreover, EIS experiment was also carried out to further verify the above conclusion.In Fig. 6c, MoP/CN-15 exhibits a smaller semicircle radius diameter than CN.It is generally accepted that a smaller semicircle radius means a lower resistance in charge transfer, as well as a faster electrons transfer in the hybrid composites 43.Thus the photocurrent response and EIS test show strong evidence of the accelerated electron transfer in MoP/CN-15 catalyst. Furthermore, the time-resolved PL decay spectra were studied to analyze the decay kinetics and the lifetime of photogenerated charge carriers quantitatively.As shown in Fig. 6d, the decay profiles of pure CN and MoP/CN-15 are fitted by a biexponential decay function with the fitting data in the inset.Obviously, the MoP/CN-15 sample exhibits the decreased short (s 1 ), long (s 2 ) and average lifetime (s), indicating that an additional electron decay pathway opens as MoP traps the electrons 44.This phenomenon suggests that more photogenerated carriers may aggregate on MoP/CN-15 and effortlessly captured by the reactants.The results provide a direct and quantified evidence for the PL and photoelectrochemical results discussed above. To further verify the above experimental results, the DFT calculation model for the MoP (0 0 1)/CN (0 0 1) heterojunction was established.The charge density difference was calculated with an isosurface of 0.02 e A A3 for better understanding the charge transfer process between CN and MoP.As shown in Fig. 7a andb, the difference charge density of the heterostructures is defined as follows: Dq 14 q hetero A q CN A q MoP 3 where q hetero , q CN and q MoP are the charge densities of the heterostructures and the isolated components.A general scheme of electron accumulation and depletion could provide insightful information about the charge migration.From the calculated results illustrated in Fig. 7a andb, a strong charge distribution occurs in the interface region of the MoP (0 0 1)/CN (0 0 1) due to the interaction of heterojunction, revealing a significant amount of charge transfer appears.Nonetheless, it is hardly to recognize where the charges deplete and accumulate within the established heterojunction interface.Thereby, the work function (W F ) of this concerned system was analyzed to help us to understand the origin of the charge transfer at the interface.In our calculations, W F for CN (0 0 1) in MoP (0 0 1)/CN (0 0 1) composite, calculated by aligning the Fermi level relative to the vacuum energy level, is found to be 4.73 eV, and for MoP (0 0 1) surface is 6.04 eV (vs.AVS) as shown in Fig. 7c.The results are close to the previous theoretical calculation 20,28293045.Therefore, the electrons will flow from CN to MoP due to the higher W F for MoP, indicating that MoP could act as an ideal electron-acceptor candidate in the composites for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction and water splitting, as depicted in Scheme 1. Combined with the experimental analysis and DFT calculations, the promotion mechanism of MoP co-catalyst on the photocatlytic activity of CN is evident. In succession, the FTIR study was carried out to monitor the CO 2 adsorption and conversion over the photocatalysts.As shown in Fig. 8a, monodentate carbonate (m-CO A2 3 , 1468 and 1539 cm A1 ), bidentate carbonate (b-CO A2 3 , 1329, 1362 and 1574 cm A1 ), carboxylate (CO A 2 , 1267, 1278 and 1678 cm A1 ) and bicarbonate (HCO A 3 , 1234, 1390 and 1424 cm A1 ) are found after the exposure to CO 2 and H 2 O without illumination.The peak at 1642 cm A1 assigned to H 2 O molecular is also emerged 46474849.After the illumination for 60 min, most peaks show minor enhancement with no obvious position changed.Moreover, a new peak at 1510 cm A1 assigned to COO A stretching appears and the peaks ascribing to dCH 2 (1488, 1495 and 1503 cm A1 ) also emerge.The phenomenon indicates a fact that the CO 2 conversion undergoes a multi-step process during the photocatalytic reduction.The intermediate products, such as HCOOH and HCHO, may convert into CO or CH 4 44,50,51.Moreover, the peaks for HCO A 3 and CO A 2 formed from CO 2 interaction with OH groups may be also the possible intermediates for CO 2 photoreduction, and it would decrease or even disappear while the peaks of surface H 2 O and CO A2 3 increase upon irradiation in the previous literatures 46,47,52.However, this phenomenon does not happen in our tests, and the peaks of HCO A 3 and CO A 2 species increase instead of decrease, revealing that HCO A 3 and CO A 2 species are continuously produced during the illumination, which makes for the formation of reduction products. Moreover, Mott-Schottky method was also applied to estimate the band energy levels and carrier densities.As shown in Fig. 8b, the negative slop in both pure CN and MoP/CN-15 indicates the n-type semiconductor characteristics.The flat potentials of CN and MoP/CN-15 are A1.07 and A1.05 V (vs. the Ag/AgCl), namely A0.87 and A0.85 V (vs.NHE) according to the Nernst equation 53.It is generally accepted that the value of the flat potentials of a ntype semiconductor is very close to (0-0.2 V more negative) that of the Fermi level 54,55.Therefore, the CB potentials for CN and MoP/CN-15 are about A1.07 eV and A1.05 eV, respectively.The VB potentials of that are calculated to be 1.58 and 1.45 eV on the basis of its band gaps, respectively.It is easily concluded that the band alignments of the MoP modified CN catalysts meet the requirement for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 and H 2 production.Moreover, it is noteworthy that the slope of MoP/CN-15 is smaller than CN, revealing the increased carrier densities according to the Mott-Schottky equation given as follows 56: where e 0; e; e 0 and N d are the electron charge, the dielectric constant of CN, the permittivity of vacuum and the electron donor density, respectively.With an e value of 3.2 for CN 57, the electrons donor densities of CN and MoP/CN-15 are calculated to be 4:87 A 10 19 cm A3 and 1:32 A 10 20 cm A3 , respectively."}, {"llm generation": "MoP/CN-15 catalyst", "source": "Surprisingly, a maximum H 2 yields of 40.38 lmol h A1 is obtained on MoP/CN-15 catalyst, which is almost 75.5 times as high as pure CN.", "context": "The XRD pattern of MoP is depicted in Fig. 1a.The main characteristic peaks can be assigned to the typical crystal facets of MoP (JCPDS PDF24-0771), which are in accordance with the previous reports 24.No impurity peaks are detected in the MoP, suggesting that a pure crystalline compound existed.For the MoP/CN composites in Fig. 1b, the peaks at 27.5and 13.1that belong to the (0 0 2) and (1 0 0) reflections of CN can be found in all the samples, indicating the interlayer-stacking of conjugated aromatic systems and in-plane tri-s-triazine units packing motif, respectively 31.With the increasing MoP content in the composites, the diffraction peaks of CN become broader and its intensity decreases gradually, whereas the diffraction peaks of MoP become stronger. The surface chemical compositions of the catalysts were further elucidated by XPS experiments.The survey scan XPS spectrum (Fig. S2y) reveals the co-existence of C, N, Mo and P elements in MoP/CN-15, which is also confirmed by the following EDX elemental mapping analysis.Furthermore, the spectra of O 1s also emerges due to the MoO x and absorbed gaseous oxygen molecules on the surface.What's more, the corresponding high-resolution XPS spectra were also investigated.As shown in Fig. 2a andb, the peaks of C 1s at 284.8 eV and 288.3 eV and the peaks of N 1s at 398.8 eV/400.6 eV/404.4eV confirm the presence of CN 32.The Mo 3d spectrum in Fig. 2c could be resolved into four peaks.The former peaks located at 228.2 eV and 231.6 eV are corresponding to the positively charged Mo in MoP (227.6 eV for Mo 0 ), while the rest of the Mo 3d peaks located at 232.2 eV and 235.4 eV are assigned to MoO x that formed by the passivation during the synthesis process 19,33,34.In Fig. 2d, the dominated peaks at 129.4 eV and 130.1 eV reveal the negatively charged P character in MoP (130.2 eV for P 0 ) 25.The peak at 133.9 eV represents the characteristic oxidation peak of phosphorous 353637. SEM and TEM images reveal the surface morphology and size of the catalysts.As depicted in Fig. S3y, the bulk g-C 3 N 4 without thermal exfoliation presents a typical lamellar structure with smooth surface and irregular curly edge.When the bulk g-C 3 N 4 was thermally treated, the hydrogen-bonds connecting the polymeric melon units in the layers are not stable enough against thermal oxidation process in air and the Van der Waals force between the layers will be broken 38.It is obvious that the CN exhibits a thin and porous flaky structure (Fig. S3y).As for the pure MoP in Fig. S3y, it is interesting to find there are two kinds of morphologies, fragmentized flake and agglomerated nanoparticles with some holes.The morphological characteristics was further verified by TEM observations.It can be seen that the sheet like MoP owns a great deal of pores with the diameter ranging in 50-80 nm (Fig. 3a), while the MoP nanoparticles even with some agglomerated clusters, possess the particle sizes ranging from 30 to 50 nm (Fig. 3b).For the hybrid MoP/CN-15 composite in Fig. S3y, a uniform flaky structure, inheriting the morphology of CN is observed, revealing that the MoP nanoparticles are intimately anchored onto the CN surface by the physical interaction and further calcination.The same conclusion can also be available for the TEM image in the inset image of Fig. 3c.Moreover, a HR-TEM image of local MoP/CN-15 in Fig. 3c shows a 0.280 nm interplanar spacing, corresponding to the (1 0 0) crystal plane of MoP 39,40.Furthermore, the EDX elemental mapping analysis was also conducted to verify the above conclusion.As shown in Fig. 3d ande, the C, N, P and Mo elements coexist in the hybrid catalyst, which further supports the uniform distribution of MoP.In addition, the surface morphology of MoP/ CN-20 composite was also investigated and the aggregated MoP particles on CN surface were detected (Fig. S4y). The specific surface areas and pore sizes of all samples were measured by N 2 adsorption-desorption to investigate the textural properties (Table S1.).As shown in Fig. 4a, all the samples display the type IV isotherms with H3 type hysteresis loops, indicating the existence of mesopore.Furthermore, the MoP/CN composites represent a visibly enhanced specific surface area of 88.5, 90.3, 95.1 and 93.6 m 2 /g with increasing MoP content while that for CN is only 69.4 m 2 /g.The increased specific surface area could provide more active sites for reaction.For proving this assumption, the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) of MoP/CN-15 was measured (Fig. S5y).Obviously, the capacitance of MoP/CN-15 with the value 59.44 mF/cm 2 is 1.57 times as high as that of CN (37.87 mF/cm 2 ) (Fig. 4b), which indicates a large surface area with more active sites emerges after the uniform doping of MoP on CN surface. CO 2 adsorption isotherms were also measured to analyze CO 2 adsorption capability quantificationally.As shown in Fig. 4c, all samples exhibit an increased uptake along with the elevated CO 2 pressure.Notably, the MoP/CN-15 composite displays a much higher CO 2 adsorption capacity than that of the pure CN and pure MoP.What's more, the optical absorption properties of the catalysts were also analyzed by UV-vis DRS.In Fig. 4d, the absorption edge of the pure CN is at 480 nm while the bare MoP shows a high absorption intensity throughout the UV and visible-light regions.For the MoP/CN composites, it can be seen that there is no obvious shift of the edge absorption, suggesting the coupling with MoP nanoparticles makes no effect on the structure of the CN.Moreover, the significantly enhanced visible-light absorption in MoP/ CN composites was observed due to the good optical absorption of MoP, which may be helpful for the photocatalytic reaction. To explore the influence of MoP in the hybrid MoP/CN composites, photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction and H 2 evolution under simulated light irradiation were conducted.Meanwhile, control experiments were conducted to distinguish whether the products containing C come from the C based photocatalyst or impurities.No hydrocarbon products are detected with N 2 flow instead of high-purity CO 2 , without illumination or photocatalyst, suggesting that CO 2 , light and photocatalysts are essential for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.As shown in Fig. 5a, CO is detected as the main product in photoreduction and only a trace amount of CH 4 produces.Moreover, O 2 as the oxidation product is also detected (Table S2y).It can be seen that all the MoP/CN composites exhibit significantly enhanced production while the pristine CN exhibits a low CO yield as a function of irradiation time.The CO yields of MoP/CN-15 increase to 5.51 lmol after 6 h illumination (Fig. 5b), which is almost 4.5 times higher than pure CN.The photocatalytic activities of H 2 production were also evaluated to confirm the role of MoP.It can be seen from Fig. 5c, a dramatically improved H 2 production is obtained as expected.Surprisingly, a maximum H 2 yields of 40.38 lmol h A1 is obtained on MoP/CN-15 catalyst, which is almost 75.5 times as high as pure CN.The AQE values of MoP/CN-15 catalyst for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction and H 2 evolution are 3.5 and 18.3 at 420 nm, respectively.What's more, the activity of the optimized photocatalyst is also compared with that of 0.5 wt Pt/CN, which is about 70 of the hydrogen production rate over 0.5 wt Pt loaded CN (57.66 lmol/h).However, the activity would decrease when further increase of MoP content.It may be ascribed to the decreased specific area and the blocked visible-light absorption on account of excessive MoP particles on CN surface.Besides that, the photocatalytic activity at per m 2 was also measured (Fig. S5y), which further confirms the realistic photocatalytic activity of MoP/CN detected above.Moreover, the H 2 evolution rate is much larger than that of CO 2 reduction because the initial activation of CO 2 and the intimate contact between photocatalyst and reactant in water splitting. The stability of the photocatalyts was evaluated through the cyclic test of photocatalytic H 2 evaluation on MoP/CN-15 catalyst.As shown in Fig. 5d, no observable activity decrease is observed through three recycling experiment over 15 h, implying the highstable photocatalytic characteristic of MoP/CN composites.Moreover, the SEM, TEM images and XRD patterns of the MoP/CN-15 photocatalyst before and after the photocatalytic CO 2 reaction and H 2 evolution were also measured to test its stability.The results show that no apparent structural changes appeared (Figs.S4y andS7y). It is generally accepted that the rapid separation and transfer of electron-hole pairs within a photocatalyst play a vital role in photocatalytic activity.Therefore, PL analysis was conducted to investigate the separation efficiency of photogenerated electron-hole pairs.As shown in Fig. 6a, CN has an intensive and broad emission peak centered at 440 nm, which is the typical band-band PL excitation that resulted from the n-p electronic transitions involving nitrogen atoms with lone pairs in CN 41.The PL emission of MoP/g-C 3 N 4 catalysts around at 440-450 nm is much weaker than that of CN, implying the efficient separation of electrons and holes.Obviously, MoP/CN-15 owns the lowest PL emission intensity, which is consistent with the excellent photocatalytic performance. Meanwhile, photocurrent and EIS experiment were also performed to illustrate the enhanced transfer of charges in the MoP/ CN catalysts.As illustrated in Fig. 6b, the uniform and fast photocurrent response appears in six light on-off cycles, indicating the stable charge transfer characteristic of the catalysts.It is easy to notice that MoP/CN-15 catalyst behaves the same characteristic of the carriers transfer with pure CN.The photocurrent exhibits a rapid increase when the light is on and a delayed decrease as the light is off, which may be ascribed to the gradual release of electrons from the doping channels 42.As expected, MoP/CN-15 composite exhibits a higher photocurrent intensity than pure CN, indicating the rapid charge transfer.Moreover, EIS experiment was also carried out to further verify the above conclusion.In Fig. 6c, MoP/CN-15 exhibits a smaller semicircle radius diameter than CN.It is generally accepted that a smaller semicircle radius means a lower resistance in charge transfer, as well as a faster electrons transfer in the hybrid composites 43.Thus the photocurrent response and EIS test show strong evidence of the accelerated electron transfer in MoP/CN-15 catalyst. Furthermore, the time-resolved PL decay spectra were studied to analyze the decay kinetics and the lifetime of photogenerated charge carriers quantitatively.As shown in Fig. 6d, the decay profiles of pure CN and MoP/CN-15 are fitted by a biexponential decay function with the fitting data in the inset.Obviously, the MoP/CN-15 sample exhibits the decreased short (s 1 ), long (s 2 ) and average lifetime (s), indicating that an additional electron decay pathway opens as MoP traps the electrons 44.This phenomenon suggests that more photogenerated carriers may aggregate on MoP/CN-15 and effortlessly captured by the reactants.The results provide a direct and quantified evidence for the PL and photoelectrochemical results discussed above. To further verify the above experimental results, the DFT calculation model for the MoP (0 0 1)/CN (0 0 1) heterojunction was established.The charge density difference was calculated with an isosurface of 0.02 e A A3 for better understanding the charge transfer process between CN and MoP.As shown in Fig. 7a andb, the difference charge density of the heterostructures is defined as follows: Dq 14 q hetero A q CN A q MoP 3 where q hetero , q CN and q MoP are the charge densities of the heterostructures and the isolated components.A general scheme of electron accumulation and depletion could provide insightful information about the charge migration.From the calculated results illustrated in Fig. 7a andb, a strong charge distribution occurs in the interface region of the MoP (0 0 1)/CN (0 0 1) due to the interaction of heterojunction, revealing a significant amount of charge transfer appears.Nonetheless, it is hardly to recognize where the charges deplete and accumulate within the established heterojunction interface.Thereby, the work function (W F ) of this concerned system was analyzed to help us to understand the origin of the charge transfer at the interface.In our calculations, W F for CN (0 0 1) in MoP (0 0 1)/CN (0 0 1) composite, calculated by aligning the Fermi level relative to the vacuum energy level, is found to be 4.73 eV, and for MoP (0 0 1) surface is 6.04 eV (vs.AVS) as shown in Fig. 7c.The results are close to the previous theoretical calculation 20,28293045.Therefore, the electrons will flow from CN to MoP due to the higher W F for MoP, indicating that MoP could act as an ideal electron-acceptor candidate in the composites for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction and water splitting, as depicted in Scheme 1. Combined with the experimental analysis and DFT calculations, the promotion mechanism of MoP co-catalyst on the photocatlytic activity of CN is evident. In succession, the FTIR study was carried out to monitor the CO 2 adsorption and conversion over the photocatalysts.As shown in Fig. 8a, monodentate carbonate (m-CO A2 3 , 1468 and 1539 cm A1 ), bidentate carbonate (b-CO A2 3 , 1329, 1362 and 1574 cm A1 ), carboxylate (CO A 2 , 1267, 1278 and 1678 cm A1 ) and bicarbonate (HCO A 3 , 1234, 1390 and 1424 cm A1 ) are found after the exposure to CO 2 and H 2 O without illumination.The peak at 1642 cm A1 assigned to H 2 O molecular is also emerged 46474849.After the illumination for 60 min, most peaks show minor enhancement with no obvious position changed.Moreover, a new peak at 1510 cm A1 assigned to COO A stretching appears and the peaks ascribing to dCH 2 (1488, 1495 and 1503 cm A1 ) also emerge.The phenomenon indicates a fact that the CO 2 conversion undergoes a multi-step process during the photocatalytic reduction.The intermediate products, such as HCOOH and HCHO, may convert into CO or CH 4 44,50,51.Moreover, the peaks for HCO A 3 and CO A 2 formed from CO 2 interaction with OH groups may be also the possible intermediates for CO 2 photoreduction, and it would decrease or even disappear while the peaks of surface H 2 O and CO A2 3 increase upon irradiation in the previous literatures 46,47,52.However, this phenomenon does not happen in our tests, and the peaks of HCO A 3 and CO A 2 species increase instead of decrease, revealing that HCO A 3 and CO A 2 species are continuously produced during the illumination, which makes for the formation of reduction products. Moreover, Mott-Schottky method was also applied to estimate the band energy levels and carrier densities.As shown in Fig. 8b, the negative slop in both pure CN and MoP/CN-15 indicates the n-type semiconductor characteristics.The flat potentials of CN and MoP/CN-15 are A1.07 and A1.05 V (vs. the Ag/AgCl), namely A0.87 and A0.85 V (vs.NHE) according to the Nernst equation 53.It is generally accepted that the value of the flat potentials of a ntype semiconductor is very close to (0-0.2 V more negative) that of the Fermi level 54,55.Therefore, the CB potentials for CN and MoP/CN-15 are about A1.07 eV and A1.05 eV, respectively.The VB potentials of that are calculated to be 1.58 and 1.45 eV on the basis of its band gaps, respectively.It is easily concluded that the band alignments of the MoP modified CN catalysts meet the requirement for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 and H 2 production.Moreover, it is noteworthy that the slope of MoP/CN-15 is smaller than CN, revealing the increased carrier densities according to the Mott-Schottky equation given as follows 56: where e 0; e; e 0 and N d are the electron charge, the dielectric constant of CN, the permittivity of vacuum and the electron donor density, respectively.With an e value of 3.2 for CN 57, the electrons donor densities of CN and MoP/CN-15 are calculated to be 4:87 A 10 19 cm A3 and 1:32 A 10 20 cm A3 , respectively."}, {"llm generation": "0.5 wt Pt/CN", "source": "What's more, the activity of the optimized photocatalyst is also compared with that of 0.5 wt Pt/CN, which is about 70 of the hydrogen production rate over 0.5 wt Pt loaded CN (57.66 lmol/h).", "context": "The XRD pattern of MoP is depicted in Fig. 1a.The main characteristic peaks can be assigned to the typical crystal facets of MoP (JCPDS PDF24-0771), which are in accordance with the previous reports 24.No impurity peaks are detected in the MoP, suggesting that a pure crystalline compound existed.For the MoP/CN composites in Fig. 1b, the peaks at 27.5and 13.1that belong to the (0 0 2) and (1 0 0) reflections of CN can be found in all the samples, indicating the interlayer-stacking of conjugated aromatic systems and in-plane tri-s-triazine units packing motif, respectively 31.With the increasing MoP content in the composites, the diffraction peaks of CN become broader and its intensity decreases gradually, whereas the diffraction peaks of MoP become stronger. The surface chemical compositions of the catalysts were further elucidated by XPS experiments.The survey scan XPS spectrum (Fig. S2y) reveals the co-existence of C, N, Mo and P elements in MoP/CN-15, which is also confirmed by the following EDX elemental mapping analysis.Furthermore, the spectra of O 1s also emerges due to the MoO x and absorbed gaseous oxygen molecules on the surface.What's more, the corresponding high-resolution XPS spectra were also investigated.As shown in Fig. 2a andb, the peaks of C 1s at 284.8 eV and 288.3 eV and the peaks of N 1s at 398.8 eV/400.6 eV/404.4eV confirm the presence of CN 32.The Mo 3d spectrum in Fig. 2c could be resolved into four peaks.The former peaks located at 228.2 eV and 231.6 eV are corresponding to the positively charged Mo in MoP (227.6 eV for Mo 0 ), while the rest of the Mo 3d peaks located at 232.2 eV and 235.4 eV are assigned to MoO x that formed by the passivation during the synthesis process 19,33,34.In Fig. 2d, the dominated peaks at 129.4 eV and 130.1 eV reveal the negatively charged P character in MoP (130.2 eV for P 0 ) 25.The peak at 133.9 eV represents the characteristic oxidation peak of phosphorous 353637. SEM and TEM images reveal the surface morphology and size of the catalysts.As depicted in Fig. S3y, the bulk g-C 3 N 4 without thermal exfoliation presents a typical lamellar structure with smooth surface and irregular curly edge.When the bulk g-C 3 N 4 was thermally treated, the hydrogen-bonds connecting the polymeric melon units in the layers are not stable enough against thermal oxidation process in air and the Van der Waals force between the layers will be broken 38.It is obvious that the CN exhibits a thin and porous flaky structure (Fig. S3y).As for the pure MoP in Fig. S3y, it is interesting to find there are two kinds of morphologies, fragmentized flake and agglomerated nanoparticles with some holes.The morphological characteristics was further verified by TEM observations.It can be seen that the sheet like MoP owns a great deal of pores with the diameter ranging in 50-80 nm (Fig. 3a), while the MoP nanoparticles even with some agglomerated clusters, possess the particle sizes ranging from 30 to 50 nm (Fig. 3b).For the hybrid MoP/CN-15 composite in Fig. S3y, a uniform flaky structure, inheriting the morphology of CN is observed, revealing that the MoP nanoparticles are intimately anchored onto the CN surface by the physical interaction and further calcination.The same conclusion can also be available for the TEM image in the inset image of Fig. 3c.Moreover, a HR-TEM image of local MoP/CN-15 in Fig. 3c shows a 0.280 nm interplanar spacing, corresponding to the (1 0 0) crystal plane of MoP 39,40.Furthermore, the EDX elemental mapping analysis was also conducted to verify the above conclusion.As shown in Fig. 3d ande, the C, N, P and Mo elements coexist in the hybrid catalyst, which further supports the uniform distribution of MoP.In addition, the surface morphology of MoP/ CN-20 composite was also investigated and the aggregated MoP particles on CN surface were detected (Fig. S4y). The specific surface areas and pore sizes of all samples were measured by N 2 adsorption-desorption to investigate the textural properties (Table S1.).As shown in Fig. 4a, all the samples display the type IV isotherms with H3 type hysteresis loops, indicating the existence of mesopore.Furthermore, the MoP/CN composites represent a visibly enhanced specific surface area of 88.5, 90.3, 95.1 and 93.6 m 2 /g with increasing MoP content while that for CN is only 69.4 m 2 /g.The increased specific surface area could provide more active sites for reaction.For proving this assumption, the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) of MoP/CN-15 was measured (Fig. S5y).Obviously, the capacitance of MoP/CN-15 with the value 59.44 mF/cm 2 is 1.57 times as high as that of CN (37.87 mF/cm 2 ) (Fig. 4b), which indicates a large surface area with more active sites emerges after the uniform doping of MoP on CN surface. CO 2 adsorption isotherms were also measured to analyze CO 2 adsorption capability quantificationally.As shown in Fig. 4c, all samples exhibit an increased uptake along with the elevated CO 2 pressure.Notably, the MoP/CN-15 composite displays a much higher CO 2 adsorption capacity than that of the pure CN and pure MoP.What's more, the optical absorption properties of the catalysts were also analyzed by UV-vis DRS.In Fig. 4d, the absorption edge of the pure CN is at 480 nm while the bare MoP shows a high absorption intensity throughout the UV and visible-light regions.For the MoP/CN composites, it can be seen that there is no obvious shift of the edge absorption, suggesting the coupling with MoP nanoparticles makes no effect on the structure of the CN.Moreover, the significantly enhanced visible-light absorption in MoP/ CN composites was observed due to the good optical absorption of MoP, which may be helpful for the photocatalytic reaction.

It is generally accepted that the rapid separation and transfer of electron-hole pairs within a photocatalyst play a vital role in photocatalytic activity.Therefore, PL analysis was conducted to investigate the separation efficiency of photogenerated electron-hole pairs.As shown in Fig. 6a, CN has an intensive and broad emission peak centered at 440 nm, which is the typical band-band PL excitation that resulted from the n-p electronic transitions involving nitrogen atoms with lone pairs in CN 41.The PL emission of MoP/g-C 3 N 4 catalysts around at 440-450 nm is much weaker than that of CN, implying the efficient separation of electrons and holes.Obviously, MoP/CN-15 owns the lowest PL emission intensity, which is consistent with the excellent photocatalytic performance. Meanwhile, photocurrent and EIS experiment were also performed to illustrate the enhanced transfer of charges in the MoP/ CN catalysts.As illustrated in Fig. 6b, the uniform and fast photocurrent response appears in six light on-off cycles, indicating the stable charge transfer characteristic of the catalysts.It is easy to notice that MoP/CN-15 catalyst behaves the same characteristic of the carriers transfer with pure CN.The photocurrent exhibits a rapid increase when the light is on and a delayed decrease as the light is off, which may be ascribed to the gradual release of electrons from the doping channels 42.As expected, MoP/CN-15 composite exhibits a higher photocurrent intensity than pure CN, indicating the rapid charge transfer.Moreover, EIS experiment was also carried out to further verify the above conclusion.In Fig. 6c, MoP/CN-15 exhibits a smaller semicircle radius diameter than CN.It is generally accepted that a smaller semicircle radius means a lower resistance in charge transfer, as well as a faster electrons transfer in the hybrid composites 43.Thus the photocurrent response and EIS test show strong evidence of the accelerated electron transfer in MoP/CN-15 catalyst.

To further verify the above experimental results, the DFT calculation model for the MoP (0 0 1)/CN (0 0 1) heterojunction was established.The charge density difference was calculated with an isosurface of 0.02 e A A3 for better understanding the charge transfer process between CN and MoP.As shown in Fig. 7a andb, the difference charge density of the heterostructures is defined as follows: Dq 14 q hetero A q CN A q MoP 3 where q hetero , q CN and q MoP are the charge densities of the heterostructures and the isolated components.A general scheme of electron accumulation and depletion could provide insightful information about the charge migration.From the calculated results illustrated in Fig. 7a andb, a strong charge distribution occurs in the interface region of the MoP (0 0 1)/CN (0 0 1) due to the interaction of heterojunction, revealing a significant amount of charge transfer appears.Nonetheless, it is hardly to recognize where the charges deplete and accumulate within the established heterojunction interface.Thereby, the work function (W F ) of this concerned system was analyzed to help us to understand the origin of the charge transfer at the interface.In our calculations, W F for CN (0 0 1) in MoP (0 0 1)/CN (0 0 1) composite, calculated by aligning the Fermi level relative to the vacuum energy level, is found to be 4.73 eV, and for MoP (0 0 1) surface is 6.04 eV (vs.AVS) as shown in Fig. 7c.The results are close to the previous theoretical calculation 20,28293045.Therefore, the electrons will flow from CN to MoP due to the higher W F for MoP, indicating that MoP could act as an ideal electron-acceptor candidate in the composites for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction and water splitting, as depicted in Scheme 1. Combined with the experimental analysis and DFT calculations, the promotion mechanism of MoP co-catalyst on the photocatlytic activity of CN is evident. In succession, the FTIR study was carried out to monitor the CO 2 adsorption and conversion over the photocatalysts.As shown in Fig. 8a, monodentate carbonate (m-CO A2 3 , 1468 and 1539 cm A1 ), bidentate carbonate (b-CO A2 3 , 1329, 1362 and 1574 cm A1 ), carboxylate (CO A 2 , 1267, 1278 and 1678 cm A1 ) and bicarbonate (HCO A 3 , 1234, 1390 and 1424 cm A1 ) are found after the exposure to CO 2 and H 2 O without illumination.The peak at 1642 cm A1 assigned to H 2 O molecular is also emerged 46474849.After the illumination for 60 min, most peaks show minor enhancement with no obvious position changed.Moreover, a new peak at 1510 cm A1 assigned to COO A stretching appears and the peaks ascribing to dCH 2 (1488, 1495 and 1503 cm A1 ) also emerge.The phenomenon indicates a fact that the CO 2 conversion undergoes a multi-step process during the photocatalytic reduction.The intermediate products, such as HCOOH and HCHO, may convert into CO or CH 4 44,50,51.Moreover, the peaks for HCO A 3 and CO A 2 formed from CO 2 interaction with OH groups may be also the possible intermediates for CO 2 photoreduction, and it would decrease or even disappear while the peaks of surface H 2 O and CO A2 3 increase upon irradiation in the previous literatures 46,47,52.However, this phenomenon does not happen in our tests, and the peaks of HCO A 3 and CO A 2 species increase instead of decrease, revealing that HCO A 3 and CO A 2 species are continuously produced during the illumination, which makes for the formation of reduction products. Moreover, Mott-Schottky method was also applied to estimate the band energy levels and carrier densities.As shown in Fig. 8b, the negative slop in both pure CN and MoP/CN-15 indicates the n-type semiconductor characteristics.The flat potentials of CN and MoP/CN-15 are A1.07 and A1.05 V (vs. the Ag/AgCl), namely A0.87 and A0.85 V (vs.NHE) according to the Nernst equation 53.It is generally accepted that the value of the flat potentials of a ntype semiconductor is very close to (0-0.2 V more negative) that of the Fermi level 54,55.Therefore, the CB potentials for CN and MoP/CN-15 are about A1.07 eV and A1.05 eV, respectively.The VB potentials of that are calculated to be 1.58 and 1.45 eV on the basis of its band gaps, respectively.It is easily concluded that the band alignments of the MoP modified CN catalysts meet the requirement for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 and H 2 production.Moreover, it is noteworthy that the slope of MoP/CN-15 is smaller than CN, revealing the increased carrier densities according to the Mott-Schottky equation given as follows 56: where e 0; e; e 0 and N d are the electron charge, the dielectric constant of CN, the permittivity of vacuum and the electron donor density, respectively.With an e value of 3.2 for CN 57, the electrons donor densities of CN and MoP/CN-15 are calculated to be 4:87 A 10 19 cm A3 and 1:32 A 10 20 cm A3 , respectively."}, {"llm generation": "MoP/CN composites", "source": "In summary, MoP nanoparticles were used as a novel cocatalyst to establish MoP/CN composites for photoreduction CO 2 and photosplitting water.", "context": "In summary, MoP nanoparticles were used as a novel cocatalyst to establish MoP/CN composites for photoreduction CO 2 and photosplitting water.The obtained MoP/CN-15 composite had the highest activity in both CO 2 photoreduction and H 2 production.A maximum CO and H 2 yields of 0.92 lmol h A1 and 40.38 lmol h A1 had been obtained on it, which were 5.5 and 75.5 times as high as pure CN.The corresponding AQE values for CO 2 reduction and H 2 production were 3.5 and 18.3 at 420 nm, respectively, considerably 70 of the hydrogen production rate over 0.5 wt Pt/CN (57.66 lmol h A1 ) under the same experimental conditions.The significant improvement of photocatalytic activity may be explained as follows: (i) the introduction of MoP could effectively separate the photoexcited charges from CN and facilitate the transfer of photogenerated electrons, which is also proven by the DFT calculation results; (ii) the doped MoP could enhance the visible-light absorption capacity; (iii) the introduction MoP nanoparticles increases the activated specific surface area.This study paves a new way to design cost-effective CN based photocatalysts.

Synthesis of g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets (CN) and MoP: CN was synthesized by thermal exfoliated bulk g-C 3 N 4 that obtained by the pyrolysis of urea as reported in our previous work 26.MoP was synthesized by typical temperature programmed reduction (TPR) method under H 2 atmosphere reported in a previous study 27. Synthesis of MoP/CN: The solution contained 50 mL deionized water, 0.5 g CN and a quantity of MoP were sonicated for 2 h and stirred vigorously overnight.Then the solution was dried at 80 C and the resulting products were calcined in Ar atmosphere at 350 C for 2 h.Finally, the MoP/CN composites were obtained and denoted as MoP/CN-x, where x (x 5, 10, 15, 20) represented the mass percentage of MoP. Photoelectrochemical measurements were proceeded on a standard three-electrode (CHI 660E, Chenhua, China).The working electrode was the FTO glass deposited catalysts while the counter electrode and reference electrode were Pt and Ag/AgCl, respectively.The electrolyte solution was 0.5 M Na 2 SO 4 solution.The working electrode was prepared as follows: CN and MoP/CN-15 were dispersed in 1 mL ethanol contained 20 lL nafion aqueous solution (5 wt), respectively, with ultrasonically treatment for 2 h.In succession, the resulting suspension was added dropwise on the FTO glass (1 cm 2 ) and evaporated to dry.The cyclic voltammetry (CV) was measured in 1.0 M KOH solution without illumination. In-situ Fourier transform Infrared spectroscopy(FTIR) was conducted to gain insights into the interaction of CO 2 and H 2 O vapor with the photocatalyst during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, as well as the conversion process of adsorption species and reaction intermediates during the reaction.The FTIR setup was descripted in Fig. S1y and the experiment was conducted as follows.Firstly, the catalyst was purged with Ar atmosphere at 200 C for 120 min to remove the residual water and other impurities on its surface.Secondly, the background spectrum was acquired when the temperature drops to 30 C and the first peak was acquired after that.Thirdly, the second peak was acquired after absorption of the CO 2 and H 2 O mixture vapor for 60 min.Finally, the light was on and the third peak was collected after illumination for 60 min. DFT calculations were carried out by exploiting the DMol3 codes that are included into Materials Studio 7.0 software.The (0 0 1) surface of CN and MoP that widely studied before was chosen for the theoretical computation in this paper 19,20,282930.For the geometry optimization and total energy calculation, conventional generalized gradient approximation (GGA) method with the Perdew-Burke-Eznerhof (PBE) exchange-correlation functional was applied.The k-points were adopted in 2 A 2 A 1 Monkhorst-Pack grid, and the DFT-D2 was chosen for the dispersion correction.DFT Semi-core Pseudopots (DSPP) pseudopotential was employed to treat the core electrons and the real space cutoff radius was maintained as 4.4 A.The vacuum space perpendicular was around 30 A, which was large enough to avoid the interaction between periodic images.The convergence criteria for energy was 1 A 10 A5 Ha while it for displacement of geometry optimization was 5 A 10 A3 A. The photocatalytic performance for CO 2 reduction and H 2 production were performed at Labsolar-6A system (Perfect Light Co., China) using a 300 W Xenon-arc lamp with a 3 AM 1.5 G filter to simulate sunlight irradiation.The 0.5 wt Pt /CN was synthesized by the in situ photodeposition method using H 2 PtCl 6 as the starting material.For a typical test in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, 50 mg photocatalyst was suspended in 100 mL deionized water.The obtained solution was vacuum-treated for 30 min under continuously stirring.Then the suspension was filled with CO 2 (99.999) at 100 kPa for 30 min to reach the equilibrium of adsorptiondesorption.After that the experiments began as the light was on.The photocatalytic H 2 production was conducted with a similar procedure except that the solution that contained 80 mL deionized water and 20 mL triethanolamine (TEOA) replacing the 100 mL deionized water and without CO 2 passed.The gas chromatograph (GC-2010 Plus, SHIMADZU, Japan) was used to test the products in our test.The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) at 420 nm (AE10 nm) wavelength was estimated via the following equation: 3. Results and discussion The XRD pattern of MoP is depicted in Fig. 1a.The main characteristic peaks can be assigned to the typical crystal facets of MoP (JCPDS PDF24-0771), which are in accordance with the previous reports 24.No impurity peaks are detected in the MoP, suggesting that a pure crystalline compound existed.For the MoP/CN composites in Fig. 1b, the peaks at 27.5and 13.1that belong to the (0 0 2) and (1 0 0) reflections of CN can be found in all the samples, indicating the interlayer-stacking of conjugated aromatic systems and in-plane tri-s-triazine units packing motif, respectively 31.With the increasing MoP content in the composites, the diffraction peaks of CN become broader and its intensity decreases gradually, whereas the diffraction peaks of MoP become stronger. The surface chemical compositions of the catalysts were further elucidated by XPS experiments.The survey scan XPS spectrum (Fig. S2y) reveals the co-existence of C, N, Mo and P elements in MoP/CN-15, which is also confirmed by the following EDX elemental mapping analysis.Furthermore, the spectra of O 1s also emerges due to the MoO x and absorbed gaseous oxygen molecules on the surface.What's more, the corresponding high-resolution XPS spectra were also investigated.As shown in Fig. 2a andb, the peaks of C 1s at 284.8 eV and 288.3 eV and the peaks of N 1s at 398.8 eV/400.6 eV/404.4eV confirm the presence of CN 32.The Mo 3d spectrum in Fig. 2c could be resolved into four peaks.The former peaks located at 228.2 eV and 231.6 eV are corresponding to the positively charged Mo in MoP (227.6 eV for Mo 0 ), while the rest of the Mo 3d peaks located at 232.2 eV and 235.4 eV are assigned to MoO x that formed by the passivation during the synthesis process 19,33,34.In Fig. 2d, the dominated peaks at 129.4 eV and 130.1 eV reveal the negatively charged P character in MoP (130.2 eV for P 0 ) 25.The peak at 133.9 eV represents the characteristic oxidation peak of phosphorous 353637. SEM and TEM images reveal the surface morphology and size of the catalysts.As depicted in Fig. S3y, the bulk g-C 3 N 4 without thermal exfoliation presents a typical lamellar structure with smooth surface and irregular curly edge.When the bulk g-C 3 N 4 was thermally treated, the hydrogen-bonds connecting the polymeric melon units in the layers are not stable enough against thermal oxidation process in air and the Van der Waals force between the layers will be broken 38.It is obvious that the CN exhibits a thin and porous flaky structure (Fig. S3y).As for the pure MoP in Fig. S3y, it is interesting to find there are two kinds of morphologies, fragmentized flake and agglomerated nanoparticles with some holes.The morphological characteristics was further verified by TEM observations.It can be seen that the sheet like MoP owns a great deal of pores with the diameter ranging in 50-80 nm (Fig. 3a), while the MoP nanoparticles even with some agglomerated clusters, possess the particle sizes ranging from 30 to 50 nm (Fig. 3b).For the hybrid MoP/CN-15 composite in Fig. S3y, a uniform flaky structure, inheriting the morphology of CN is observed, revealing that the MoP nanoparticles are intimately anchored onto the CN surface by the physical interaction and further calcination.The same conclusion can also be available for the TEM image in the inset image of Fig. 3c.Moreover, a HR-TEM image of local MoP/CN-15 in Fig. 3c shows a 0.280 nm interplanar spacing, corresponding to the (1 0 0) crystal plane of MoP 39,40.Furthermore, the EDX elemental mapping analysis was also conducted to verify the above conclusion.As shown in Fig. 3d ande, the C, N, P and Mo elements coexist in the hybrid catalyst, which further supports the uniform distribution of MoP.In addition, the surface morphology of MoP/ CN-20 composite was also investigated and the aggregated MoP particles on CN surface were detected (Fig. S4y). The specific surface areas and pore sizes of all samples were measured by N 2 adsorption-desorption to investigate the textural properties (Table S1.).As shown in Fig. 4a, all the samples display the type IV isotherms with H3 type hysteresis loops, indicating the existence of mesopore.Furthermore, the MoP/CN composites represent a visibly enhanced specific surface area of 88.5, 90.3, 95.1 and 93.6 m 2 /g with increasing MoP content while that for CN is only 69.4 m 2 /g.The increased specific surface area could provide more active sites for reaction.For proving this assumption, the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) of MoP/CN-15 was measured (Fig. S5y).Obviously, the capacitance of MoP/CN-15 with the value 59.44 mF/cm 2 is 1.57 times as high as that of CN (37.87 mF/cm 2 ) (Fig. 4b), which indicates a large surface area with more active sites emerges after the uniform doping of MoP on CN surface. CO 2 adsorption isotherms were also measured to analyze CO 2 adsorption capability quantificationally.As shown in Fig. 4c, all samples exhibit an increased uptake along with the elevated CO 2 pressure.Notably, the MoP/CN-15 composite displays a much higher CO 2 adsorption capacity than that of the pure CN and pure MoP.What's more, the optical absorption properties of the catalysts were also analyzed by UV-vis DRS.In Fig. 4d, the absorption edge of the pure CN is at 480 nm while the bare MoP shows a high absorption intensity throughout the UV and visible-light regions.For the MoP/CN composites, it can be seen that there is no obvious shift of the edge absorption, suggesting the coupling with MoP nanoparticles makes no effect on the structure of the CN.Moreover, the significantly enhanced visible-light absorption in MoP/ CN composites was observed due to the good optical absorption of MoP, which may be helpful for the photocatalytic reaction. To explore the influence of MoP in the hybrid MoP/CN composites, photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction and H 2 evolution under simulated light irradiation were conducted.Meanwhile, control experiments were conducted to distinguish whether the products containing C come from the C based photocatalyst or impurities.No hydrocarbon products are detected with N 2 flow instead of high-purity CO 2 , without illumination or photocatalyst, suggesting that CO 2 , light and photocatalysts are essential for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.As shown in Fig. 5a, CO is detected as the main product in photoreduction and only a trace amount of CH 4 produces.Moreover, O 2 as the oxidation product is also detected (Table S2y).It can be seen that all the MoP/CN composites exhibit significantly enhanced production while the pristine CN exhibits a low CO yield as a function of irradiation time.The CO yields of MoP/CN-15 increase to 5.51 lmol after 6 h illumination (Fig. 5b), which is almost 4.5 times higher than pure CN.The photocatalytic activities of H 2 production were also evaluated to confirm the role of MoP.It can be seen from Fig. 5c, a dramatically improved H 2 production is obtained as expected.Surprisingly, a maximum H 2 yields of 40.38 lmol h A1 is obtained on MoP/CN-15 catalyst, which is almost 75.5 times as high as pure CN.The AQE values of MoP/CN-15 catalyst for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction and H 2 evolution are 3.5 and 18.3 at 420 nm, respectively.What's more, the activity of the optimized photocatalyst is also compared with that of 0.5 wt Pt/CN, which is about 70 of the hydrogen production rate over 0.5 wt Pt loaded CN (57.66 lmol/h).However, the activity would decrease when further increase of MoP content.It may be ascribed to the decreased specific area and the blocked visible-light absorption on account of excessive MoP particles on CN surface.Besides that, the photocatalytic activity at per m 2 was also measured (Fig. S5y), which further confirms the realistic photocatalytic activity of MoP/CN detected above.Moreover, the H 2 evolution rate is much larger than that of CO 2 reduction because the initial activation of CO 2 and the intimate contact between photocatalyst and reactant in water splitting. The stability of the photocatalyts was evaluated through the cyclic test of photocatalytic H 2 evaluation on MoP/CN-15 catalyst.As shown in Fig. 5d, no observable activity decrease is observed through three recycling experiment over 15 h, implying the highstable photocatalytic characteristic of MoP/CN composites.Moreover, the SEM, TEM images and XRD patterns of the MoP/CN-15 photocatalyst before and after the photocatalytic CO 2 reaction and H 2 evolution were also measured to test its stability.The results show that no apparent structural changes appeared (Figs.S4y andS7y). It is generally accepted that the rapid separation and transfer of electron-hole pairs within a photocatalyst play a vital role in photocatalytic activity.Therefore, PL analysis was conducted to investigate the separation efficiency of photogenerated electron-hole pairs.As shown in Fig. 6a, CN has an intensive and broad emission peak centered at 440 nm, which is the typical band-band PL excitation that resulted from the n-p electronic transitions involving nitrogen atoms with lone pairs in CN 41.The PL emission of MoP/g-C 3 N 4 catalysts around at 440-450 nm is much weaker than that of CN, implying the efficient separation of electrons and holes.Obviously, MoP/CN-15 owns the lowest PL emission intensity, which is consistent with the excellent photocatalytic performance. Meanwhile, photocurrent and EIS experiment were also performed to illustrate the enhanced transfer of charges in the MoP/ CN catalysts.As illustrated in Fig. 6b, the uniform and fast photocurrent response appears in six light on-off cycles, indicating the stable charge transfer characteristic of the catalysts.It is easy to notice that MoP/CN-15 catalyst behaves the same characteristic of the carriers transfer with pure CN.The photocurrent exhibits a rapid increase when the light is on and a delayed decrease as the light is off, which may be ascribed to the gradual release of electrons from the doping channels 42.As expected, MoP/CN-15 composite exhibits a higher photocurrent intensity than pure CN, indicating the rapid charge transfer.Moreover, EIS experiment was also carried out to further verify the above conclusion.In Fig. 6c, MoP/CN-15 exhibits a smaller semicircle radius diameter than CN.It is generally accepted that a smaller semicircle radius means a lower resistance in charge transfer, as well as a faster electrons transfer in the hybrid composites 43.Thus the photocurrent response and EIS test show strong evidence of the accelerated electron transfer in MoP/CN-15 catalyst. Furthermore, the time-resolved PL decay spectra were studied to analyze the decay kinetics and the lifetime of photogenerated charge carriers quantitatively.As shown in Fig. 6d, the decay profiles of pure CN and MoP/CN-15 are fitted by a biexponential decay function with the fitting data in the inset.Obviously, the MoP/CN-15 sample exhibits the decreased short (s 1 ), long (s 2 ) and average lifetime (s), indicating that an additional electron decay pathway opens as MoP traps the electrons 44.This phenomenon suggests that more photogenerated carriers may aggregate on MoP/CN-15 and effortlessly captured by the reactants.The results provide a direct and quantified evidence for the PL and photoelectrochemical results discussed above. To further verify the above experimental results, the DFT calculation model for the MoP (0 0 1)/CN (0 0 1) heterojunction was established.The charge density difference was calculated with an isosurface of 0.02 e A A3 for better understanding the charge transfer process between CN and MoP.As shown in Fig. 7a andb, the difference charge density of the heterostructures is defined as follows: Dq 14 q hetero A q CN A q MoP 3 where q hetero , q CN and q MoP are the charge densities of the heterostructures and the isolated components.A general scheme of electron accumulation and depletion could provide insightful information about the charge migration.From the calculated results illustrated in Fig. 7a andb, a strong charge distribution occurs in the interface region of the MoP (0 0 1)/CN (0 0 1) due to the interaction of heterojunction, revealing a significant amount of charge transfer appears.Nonetheless, it is hardly to recognize where the charges deplete and accumulate within the established heterojunction interface.Thereby, the work function (W F ) of this concerned system was analyzed to help us to understand the origin of the charge transfer at the interface.In our calculations, W F for CN (0 0 1) in MoP (0 0 1)/CN (0 0 1) composite, calculated by aligning the Fermi level relative to the vacuum energy level, is found to be 4.73 eV, and for MoP (0 0 1) surface is 6.04 eV (vs.AVS) as shown in Fig. 7c.The results are close to the previous theoretical calculation 20,28293045.Therefore, the electrons will flow from CN to MoP due to the higher W F for MoP, indicating that MoP could act as an ideal electron-acceptor candidate in the composites for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction and water splitting, as depicted in Scheme 1. Combined with the experimental analysis and DFT calculations, the promotion mechanism of MoP co-catalyst on the photocatlytic activity of CN is evident. In succession, the FTIR study was carried out to monitor the CO 2 adsorption and conversion over the photocatalysts.As shown in Fig. 8a, monodentate carbonate (m-CO A2 3 , 1468 and 1539 cm A1 ), bidentate carbonate (b-CO A2 3 , 1329, 1362 and 1574 cm A1 ), carboxylate (CO A 2 , 1267, 1278 and 1678 cm A1 ) and bicarbonate (HCO A 3 , 1234, 1390 and 1424 cm A1 ) are found after the exposure to CO 2 and H 2 O without illumination.The peak at 1642 cm A1 assigned to H 2 O molecular is also emerged 46474849.After the illumination for 60 min, most peaks show minor enhancement with no obvious position changed.Moreover, a new peak at 1510 cm A1 assigned to COO A stretching appears and the peaks ascribing to dCH 2 (1488, 1495 and 1503 cm A1 ) also emerge.The phenomenon indicates a fact that the CO 2 conversion undergoes a multi-step process during the photocatalytic reduction.The intermediate products, such as HCOOH and HCHO, may convert into CO or CH 4 44,50,51.Moreover, the peaks for HCO A 3 and CO A 2 formed from CO 2 interaction with OH groups may be also the possible intermediates for CO 2 photoreduction, and it would decrease or even disappear while the peaks of surface H 2 O and CO A2 3 increase upon irradiation in the previous literatures 46,47,52.However, this phenomenon does not happen in our tests, and the peaks of HCO A 3 and CO A 2 species increase instead of decrease, revealing that HCO A 3 and CO A 2 species are continuously produced during the illumination, which makes for the formation of reduction products. Moreover, Mott-Schottky method was also applied to estimate the band energy levels and carrier densities.As shown in Fig. 8b, the negative slop in both pure CN and MoP/CN-15 indicates the n-type semiconductor characteristics.The flat potentials of CN and MoP/CN-15 are A1.07 and A1.05 V (vs. the Ag/AgCl), namely A0.87 and A0.85 V (vs.NHE) according to the Nernst equation 53.It is generally accepted that the value of the flat potentials of a ntype semiconductor is very close to (0-0.2 V more negative) that of the Fermi level 54,55.Therefore, the CB potentials for CN and MoP/CN-15 are about A1.07 eV and A1.05 eV, respectively.The VB potentials of that are calculated to be 1.58 and 1.45 eV on the basis of its band gaps, respectively.It is easily concluded that the band alignments of the MoP modified CN catalysts meet the requirement for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 and H 2 production.Moreover, it is noteworthy that the slope of MoP/CN-15 is smaller than CN, revealing the increased carrier densities according to the Mott-Schottky equation given as follows 56: where e 0; e; e 0 and N d are the electron charge, the dielectric constant of CN, the permittivity of vacuum and the electron donor density, respectively.With an e value of 3.2 for CN 57, the electrons donor densities of CN and MoP/CN-15 are calculated to be 4:87 A 10 19 cm A3 and 1:32 A 10 20 cm A3 , respectively. In summary, MoP nanoparticles were used as a novel cocatalyst to establish MoP/CN composites for photoreduction CO 2 and photosplitting water.The obtained MoP/CN-15 composite had the highest activity in both CO 2 photoreduction and H 2 production.A maximum CO and H 2 yields of 0.92 lmol h A1 and 40.38 lmol h A1 had been obtained on it, which were 5.5 and 75.5 times as high as pure CN.The corresponding AQE values for CO 2 reduction and H 2 production were 3.5 and 18.3 at 420 nm, respectively, considerably 70 of the hydrogen production rate over 0.5 wt Pt/CN (57.66 lmol h A1 ) under the same experimental conditions.The significant improvement of photocatalytic activity may be explained as follows: (i) the introduction of MoP could effectively separate the photoexcited charges from CN and facilitate the transfer of photogenerated electrons, which is also proven by the DFT calculation results; (ii) the doped MoP could enhance the visible-light absorption capacity; (iii) the introduction MoP nanoparticles increases the activated specific surface area.This study paves a new way to design cost-effective CN based photocatalysts.

The surface chemical compositions of the catalysts were further elucidated by XPS experiments.The survey scan XPS spectrum (Fig. S2y) reveals the co-existence of C, N, Mo and P elements in MoP/CN-15, which is also confirmed by the following EDX elemental mapping analysis.Furthermore, the spectra of O 1s also emerges due to the MoO x and absorbed gaseous oxygen molecules on the surface.What's more, the corresponding high-resolution XPS spectra were also investigated.As shown in Fig. 2a andb, the peaks of C 1s at 284.8 eV and 288.3 eV and the peaks of N 1s at 398.8 eV/400.6 eV/404.4eV confirm the presence of CN 32.The Mo 3d spectrum in Fig. 2c could be resolved into four peaks.The former peaks located at 228.2 eV and 231.6 eV are corresponding to the positively charged Mo in MoP (227.6 eV for Mo 0 ), while the rest of the Mo 3d peaks located at 232.2 eV and 235.4 eV are assigned to MoO x that formed by the passivation during the synthesis process 19,33,34.In Fig. 2d, the dominated peaks at 129.4 eV and 130.1 eV reveal the negatively charged P character in MoP (130.2 eV for P 0 ) 25.The peak at 133.9 eV represents the characteristic oxidation peak of phosphorous 353637. SEM and TEM images reveal the surface morphology and size of the catalysts.As depicted in Fig. S3y, the bulk g-C 3 N 4 without thermal exfoliation presents a typical lamellar structure with smooth surface and irregular curly edge.When the bulk g-C 3 N 4 was thermally treated, the hydrogen-bonds connecting the polymeric melon units in the layers are not stable enough against thermal oxidation process in air and the Van der Waals force between the layers will be broken 38.It is obvious that the CN exhibits a thin and porous flaky structure (Fig. S3y).As for the pure MoP in Fig. S3y, it is interesting to find there are two kinds of morphologies, fragmentized flake and agglomerated nanoparticles with some holes.The morphological characteristics was further verified by TEM observations.It can be seen that the sheet like MoP owns a great deal of pores with the diameter ranging in 50-80 nm (Fig. 3a), while the MoP nanoparticles even with some agglomerated clusters, possess the particle sizes ranging from 30 to 50 nm (Fig. 3b).For the hybrid MoP/CN-15 composite in Fig. S3y, a uniform flaky structure, inheriting the morphology of CN is observed, revealing that the MoP nanoparticles are intimately anchored onto the CN surface by the physical interaction and further calcination.The same conclusion can also be available for the TEM image in the inset image of Fig. 3c.Moreover, a HR-TEM image of local MoP/CN-15 in Fig. 3c shows a 0.280 nm interplanar spacing, corresponding to the (1 0 0) crystal plane of MoP 39,40.Furthermore, the EDX elemental mapping analysis was also conducted to verify the above conclusion.As shown in Fig. 3d ande, the C, N, P and Mo elements coexist in the hybrid catalyst, which further supports the uniform distribution of MoP.In addition, the surface morphology of MoP/ CN-20 composite was also investigated and the aggregated MoP particles on CN surface were detected (Fig. S4y). The specific surface areas and pore sizes of all samples were measured by N 2 adsorption-desorption to investigate the textural properties (Table S1.).As shown in Fig. 4a, all the samples display the type IV isotherms with H3 type hysteresis loops, indicating the existence of mesopore.Furthermore, the MoP/CN composites represent a visibly enhanced specific surface area of 88.5, 90.3, 95.1 and 93.6 m 2 /g with increasing MoP content while that for CN is only 69.4 m 2 /g.The increased specific surface area could provide more active sites for reaction.For proving this assumption, the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) of MoP/CN-15 was measured (Fig. S5y).Obviously, the capacitance of MoP/CN-15 with the value 59.44 mF/cm 2 is 1.57 times as high as that of CN (37.87 mF/cm 2 ) (Fig. 4b), which indicates a large surface area with more active sites emerges after the uniform doping of MoP on CN surface. CO 2 adsorption isotherms were also measured to analyze CO 2 adsorption capability quantificationally.As shown in Fig. 4c, all samples exhibit an increased uptake along with the elevated CO 2 pressure.Notably, the MoP/CN-15 composite displays a much higher CO 2 adsorption capacity than that of the pure CN and pure MoP.What's more, the optical absorption properties of the catalysts were also analyzed by UV-vis DRS.In Fig. 4d, the absorption edge of the pure CN is at 480 nm while the bare MoP shows a high absorption intensity throughout the UV and visible-light regions.For the MoP/CN composites, it can be seen that there is no obvious shift of the edge absorption, suggesting the coupling with MoP nanoparticles makes no effect on the structure of the CN.Moreover, the significantly enhanced visible-light absorption in MoP/ CN composites was observed due to the good optical absorption of MoP, which may be helpful for the photocatalytic reaction. To explore the influence of MoP in the hybrid MoP/CN composites, photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction and H 2 evolution under simulated light irradiation were conducted.Meanwhile, control experiments were conducted to distinguish whether the products containing C come from the C based photocatalyst or impurities.No hydrocarbon products are detected with N 2 flow instead of high-purity CO 2 , without illumination or photocatalyst, suggesting that CO 2 , light and photocatalysts are essential for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.As shown in Fig. 5a, CO is detected as the main product in photoreduction and only a trace amount of CH 4 produces.Moreover, O 2 as the oxidation product is also detected (Table S2y).It can be seen that all the MoP/CN composites exhibit significantly enhanced production while the pristine CN exhibits a low CO yield as a function of irradiation time.The CO yields of MoP/CN-15 increase to 5.51 lmol after 6 h illumination (Fig. 5b), which is almost 4.5 times higher than pure CN.The photocatalytic activities of H 2 production were also evaluated to confirm the role of MoP.It can be seen from Fig. 5c, a dramatically improved H 2 production is obtained as expected.Surprisingly, a maximum H 2 yields of 40.38 lmol h A1 is obtained on MoP/CN-15 catalyst, which is almost 75.5 times as high as pure CN.The AQE values of MoP/CN-15 catalyst for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction and H 2 evolution are 3.5 and 18.3 at 420 nm, respectively.What's more, the activity of the optimized photocatalyst is also compared with that of 0.5 wt Pt/CN, which is about 70 of the hydrogen production rate over 0.5 wt Pt loaded CN (57.66 lmol/h).However, the activity would decrease when further increase of MoP content.It may be ascribed to the decreased specific area and the blocked visible-light absorption on account of excessive MoP particles on CN surface.Besides that, the photocatalytic activity at per m 2 was also measured (Fig. S5y), which further confirms the realistic photocatalytic activity of MoP/CN detected above.Moreover, the H 2 evolution rate is much larger than that of CO 2 reduction because the initial activation of CO 2 and the intimate contact between photocatalyst and reactant in water splitting. The stability of the photocatalyts was evaluated through the cyclic test of photocatalytic H 2 evaluation on MoP/CN-15 catalyst.As shown in Fig. 5d, no observable activity decrease is observed through three recycling experiment over 15 h, implying the highstable photocatalytic characteristic of MoP/CN composites.Moreover, the SEM, TEM images and XRD patterns of the MoP/CN-15 photocatalyst before and after the photocatalytic CO 2 reaction and H 2 evolution were also measured to test its stability.The results show that no apparent structural changes appeared (Figs.S4y andS7y). It is generally accepted that the rapid separation and transfer of electron-hole pairs within a photocatalyst play a vital role in photocatalytic activity.Therefore, PL analysis was conducted to investigate the separation efficiency of photogenerated electron-hole pairs.As shown in Fig. 6a, CN has an intensive and broad emission peak centered at 440 nm, which is the typical band-band PL excitation that resulted from the n-p electronic transitions involving nitrogen atoms with lone pairs in CN 41.The PL emission of MoP/g-C 3 N 4 catalysts around at 440-450 nm is much weaker than that of CN, implying the efficient separation of electrons and holes.Obviously, MoP/CN-15 owns the lowest PL emission intensity, which is consistent with the excellent photocatalytic performance. Meanwhile, photocurrent and EIS experiment were also performed to illustrate the enhanced transfer of charges in the MoP/ CN catalysts.As illustrated in Fig. 6b, the uniform and fast photocurrent response appears in six light on-off cycles, indicating the stable charge transfer characteristic of the catalysts.It is easy to notice that MoP/CN-15 catalyst behaves the same characteristic of the carriers transfer with pure CN.The photocurrent exhibits a rapid increase when the light is on and a delayed decrease as the light is off, which may be ascribed to the gradual release of electrons from the doping channels 42.As expected, MoP/CN-15 composite exhibits a higher photocurrent intensity than pure CN, indicating the rapid charge transfer.Moreover, EIS experiment was also carried out to further verify the above conclusion.In Fig. 6c, MoP/CN-15 exhibits a smaller semicircle radius diameter than CN.It is generally accepted that a smaller semicircle radius means a lower resistance in charge transfer, as well as a faster electrons transfer in the hybrid composites 43.Thus the photocurrent response and EIS test show strong evidence of the accelerated electron transfer in MoP/CN-15 catalyst. Furthermore, the time-resolved PL decay spectra were studied to analyze the decay kinetics and the lifetime of photogenerated charge carriers quantitatively.As shown in Fig. 6d, the decay profiles of pure CN and MoP/CN-15 are fitted by a biexponential decay function with the fitting data in the inset.Obviously, the MoP/CN-15 sample exhibits the decreased short (s 1 ), long (s 2 ) and average lifetime (s), indicating that an additional electron decay pathway opens as MoP traps the electrons 44.This phenomenon suggests that more photogenerated carriers may aggregate on MoP/CN-15 and effortlessly captured by the reactants.The results provide a direct and quantified evidence for the PL and photoelectrochemical results discussed above. To further verify the above experimental results, the DFT calculation model for the MoP (0 0 1)/CN (0 0 1) heterojunction was established.The charge density difference was calculated with an isosurface of 0.02 e A A3 for better understanding the charge transfer process between CN and MoP.As shown in Fig. 7a andb, the difference charge density of the heterostructures is defined as follows: Dq 14 q hetero A q CN A q MoP 3 where q hetero , q CN and q MoP are the charge densities of the heterostructures and the isolated components.A general scheme of electron accumulation and depletion could provide insightful information about the charge migration.From the calculated results illustrated in Fig. 7a andb, a strong charge distribution occurs in the interface region of the MoP (0 0 1)/CN (0 0 1) due to the interaction of heterojunction, revealing a significant amount of charge transfer appears.Nonetheless, it is hardly to recognize where the charges deplete and accumulate within the established heterojunction interface.Thereby, the work function (W F ) of this concerned system was analyzed to help us to understand the origin of the charge transfer at the interface.In our calculations, W F for CN (0 0 1) in MoP (0 0 1)/CN (0 0 1) composite, calculated by aligning the Fermi level relative to the vacuum energy level, is found to be 4.73 eV, and for MoP (0 0 1) surface is 6.04 eV (vs.AVS) as shown in Fig. 7c.The results are close to the previous theoretical calculation 20,28293045.Therefore, the electrons will flow from CN to MoP due to the higher W F for MoP, indicating that MoP could act as an ideal electron-acceptor candidate in the composites for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction and water splitting, as depicted in Scheme 1. Combined with the experimental analysis and DFT calculations, the promotion mechanism of MoP co-catalyst on the photocatlytic activity of CN is evident. In succession, the FTIR study was carried out to monitor the CO 2 adsorption and conversion over the photocatalysts.As shown in Fig. 8a, monodentate carbonate (m-CO A2 3 , 1468 and 1539 cm A1 ), bidentate carbonate (b-CO A2 3 , 1329, 1362 and 1574 cm A1 ), carboxylate (CO A 2 , 1267, 1278 and 1678 cm A1 ) and bicarbonate (HCO A 3 , 1234, 1390 and 1424 cm A1 ) are found after the exposure to CO 2 and H 2 O without illumination.The peak at 1642 cm A1 assigned to H 2 O molecular is also emerged 46474849.After the illumination for 60 min, most peaks show minor enhancement with no obvious position changed.Moreover, a new peak at 1510 cm A1 assigned to COO A stretching appears and the peaks ascribing to dCH 2 (1488, 1495 and 1503 cm A1 ) also emerge.The phenomenon indicates a fact that the CO 2 conversion undergoes a multi-step process during the photocatalytic reduction.The intermediate products, such as HCOOH and HCHO, may convert into CO or CH 4 44,50,51.Moreover, the peaks for HCO A 3 and CO A 2 formed from CO 2 interaction with OH groups may be also the possible intermediates for CO 2 photoreduction, and it would decrease or even disappear while the peaks of surface H 2 O and CO A2 3 increase upon irradiation in the previous literatures 46,47,52.However, this phenomenon does not happen in our tests, and the peaks of HCO A 3 and CO A 2 species increase instead of decrease, revealing that HCO A 3 and CO A 2 species are continuously produced during the illumination, which makes for the formation of reduction products. Moreover, Mott-Schottky method was also applied to estimate the band energy levels and carrier densities.As shown in Fig. 8b, the negative slop in both pure CN and MoP/CN-15 indicates the n-type semiconductor characteristics.The flat potentials of CN and MoP/CN-15 are A1.07 and A1.05 V (vs. the Ag/AgCl), namely A0.87 and A0.85 V (vs.NHE) according to the Nernst equation 53.It is generally accepted that the value of the flat potentials of a ntype semiconductor is very close to (0-0.2 V more negative) that of the Fermi level 54,55.Therefore, the CB potentials for CN and MoP/CN-15 are about A1.07 eV and A1.05 eV, respectively.The VB potentials of that are calculated to be 1.58 and 1.45 eV on the basis of its band gaps, respectively.It is easily concluded that the band alignments of the MoP modified CN catalysts meet the requirement for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 and H 2 production.Moreover, it is noteworthy that the slope of MoP/CN-15 is smaller than CN, revealing the increased carrier densities according to the Mott-Schottky equation given as follows 56: where e 0; e; e 0 and N d are the electron charge, the dielectric constant of CN, the permittivity of vacuum and the electron donor density, respectively.With an e value of 3.2 for CN 57, the electrons donor densities of CN and MoP/CN-15 are calculated to be 4:87 A 10 19 cm A3 and 1:32 A 10 20 cm A3 , respectively."}], "lamp": [{"llm generation": "Xenon (300 W Xenon-arc lamp)", "source": "The photocatalytic performance for CO 2 reduction and H 2 production were performed at Labsolar-6A system (Perfect Light Co., China) using a 300 W Xenon-arc lamp with a 3 AM 1.5 G filter to simulate sunlight irradiation.", "context": "The information on detailed description of the catalysts synthesis and characterization techniques used in this study is in Sections S1 and S2 (Electronic Supplementary Information, ESI). Synthesis of g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets (CN) and MoP: CN was synthesized by thermal exfoliated bulk g-C 3 N 4 that obtained by the pyrolysis of urea as reported in our previous work 26.MoP was synthesized by typical temperature programmed reduction (TPR) method under H 2 atmosphere reported in a previous study 27. Synthesis of MoP/CN: The solution contained 50 mL deionized water, 0.5 g CN and a quantity of MoP were sonicated for 2 h and stirred vigorously overnight.Then the solution was dried at 80 C and the resulting products were calcined in Ar atmosphere at 350 C for 2 h.Finally, the MoP/CN composites were obtained and denoted as MoP/CN-x, where x (x 5, 10, 15, 20) represented the mass percentage of MoP. Photoelectrochemical measurements were proceeded on a standard three-electrode (CHI 660E, Chenhua, China).The working electrode was the FTO glass deposited catalysts while the counter electrode and reference electrode were Pt and Ag/AgCl, respectively.The electrolyte solution was 0.5 M Na 2 SO 4 solution.The working electrode was prepared as follows: CN and MoP/CN-15 were dispersed in 1 mL ethanol contained 20 lL nafion aqueous solution (5 wt), respectively, with ultrasonically treatment for 2 h.In succession, the resulting suspension was added dropwise on the FTO glass (1 cm 2 ) and evaporated to dry.The cyclic voltammetry (CV) was measured in 1.0 M KOH solution without illumination. In-situ Fourier transform Infrared spectroscopy(FTIR) was conducted to gain insights into the interaction of CO 2 and H 2 O vapor with the photocatalyst during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, as well as the conversion process of adsorption species and reaction intermediates during the reaction.The FTIR setup was descripted in Fig. S1y and the experiment was conducted as follows.Firstly, the catalyst was purged with Ar atmosphere at 200 C for 120 min to remove the residual water and other impurities on its surface.Secondly, the background spectrum was acquired when the temperature drops to 30 C and the first peak was acquired after that.Thirdly, the second peak was acquired after absorption of the CO 2 and H 2 O mixture vapor for 60 min.Finally, the light was on and the third peak was collected after illumination for 60 min. DFT calculations were carried out by exploiting the DMol3 codes that are included into Materials Studio 7.0 software.The (0 0 1) surface of CN and MoP that widely studied before was chosen for the theoretical computation in this paper 19,20,282930.For the geometry optimization and total energy calculation, conventional generalized gradient approximation (GGA) method with the Perdew-Burke-Eznerhof (PBE) exchange-correlation functional was applied.The k-points were adopted in 2 A 2 A 1 Monkhorst-Pack grid, and the DFT-D2 was chosen for the dispersion correction.DFT Semi-core Pseudopots (DSPP) pseudopotential was employed to treat the core electrons and the real space cutoff radius was maintained as 4.4 A.The vacuum space perpendicular was around 30 A, which was large enough to avoid the interaction between periodic images.The convergence criteria for energy was 1 A 10 A5 Ha while it for displacement of geometry optimization was 5 A 10 A3 A. The photocatalytic performance for CO 2 reduction and H 2 production were performed at Labsolar-6A system (Perfect Light Co., China) using a 300 W Xenon-arc lamp with a 3 AM 1.5 G filter to simulate sunlight irradiation.The 0.5 wt Pt /CN was synthesized by the in situ photodeposition method using H 2 PtCl 6 as the starting material.For a typical test in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, 50 mg photocatalyst was suspended in 100 mL deionized water.The obtained solution was vacuum-treated for 30 min under continuously stirring.Then the suspension was filled with CO 2 (99.999) at 100 kPa for 30 min to reach the equilibrium of adsorptiondesorption.After that the experiments began as the light was on.The photocatalytic H 2 production was conducted with a similar procedure except that the solution that contained 80 mL deionized water and 20 mL triethanolamine (TEOA) replacing the 100 mL deionized water and without CO 2 passed.The gas chromatograph (GC-2010 Plus, SHIMADZU, Japan) was used to test the products in our test.The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) at 420 nm (AE10 nm) wavelength was estimated via the following equation: 3. Results and discussion The XRD pattern of MoP is depicted in Fig. 1a.The main characteristic peaks can be assigned to the typical crystal facets of MoP (JCPDS PDF24-0771), which are in accordance with the previous reports 24.No impurity peaks are detected in the MoP, suggesting that a pure crystalline compound existed.For the MoP/CN composites in Fig. 1b, the peaks at 27.5and 13.1that belong to the (0 0 2) and (1 0 0) reflections of CN can be found in all the samples, indicating the interlayer-stacking of conjugated aromatic systems and in-plane tri-s-triazine units packing motif, respectively 31.With the increasing MoP content in the composites, the diffraction peaks of CN become broader and its intensity decreases gradually, whereas the diffraction peaks of MoP become stronger. The surface chemical compositions of the catalysts were further elucidated by XPS experiments.The survey scan XPS spectrum (Fig. S2y) reveals the co-existence of C, N, Mo and P elements in MoP/CN-15, which is also confirmed by the following EDX elemental mapping analysis.Furthermore, the spectra of O 1s also emerges due to the MoO x and absorbed gaseous oxygen molecules on the surface.What's more, the corresponding high-resolution XPS spectra were also investigated.As shown in Fig. 2a andb, the peaks of C 1s at 284.8 eV and 288.3 eV and the peaks of N 1s at 398.8 eV/400.6 eV/404.4eV confirm the presence of CN 32.The Mo 3d spectrum in Fig. 2c could be resolved into four peaks.The former peaks located at 228.2 eV and 231.6 eV are corresponding to the positively charged Mo in MoP (227.6 eV for Mo 0 ), while the rest of the Mo 3d peaks located at 232.2 eV and 235.4 eV are assigned to MoO x that formed by the passivation during the synthesis process 19,33,34.In Fig. 2d, the dominated peaks at 129.4 eV and 130.1 eV reveal the negatively charged P character in MoP (130.2 eV for P 0 ) 25.The peak at 133.9 eV represents the characteristic oxidation peak of phosphorous 353637. SEM and TEM images reveal the surface morphology and size of the catalysts.As depicted in Fig. S3y, the bulk g-C 3 N 4 without thermal exfoliation presents a typical lamellar structure with smooth surface and irregular curly edge.When the bulk g-C 3 N 4 was thermally treated, the hydrogen-bonds connecting the polymeric melon units in the layers are not stable enough against thermal oxidation process in air and the Van der Waals force between the layers will be broken 38.It is obvious that the CN exhibits a thin and porous flaky structure (Fig. S3y).As for the pure MoP in Fig. S3y, it is interesting to find there are two kinds of morphologies, fragmentized flake and agglomerated nanoparticles with some holes.The morphological characteristics was further verified by TEM observations.It can be seen that the sheet like MoP owns a great deal of pores with the diameter ranging in 50-80 nm (Fig. 3a), while the MoP nanoparticles even with some agglomerated clusters, possess the particle sizes ranging from 30 to 50 nm (Fig. 3b).For the hybrid MoP/CN-15 composite in Fig. S3y, a uniform flaky structure, inheriting the morphology of CN is observed, revealing that the MoP nanoparticles are intimately anchored onto the CN surface by the physical interaction and further calcination.The same conclusion can also be available for the TEM image in the inset image of Fig. 3c.Moreover, a HR-TEM image of local MoP/CN-15 in Fig. 3c shows a 0.280 nm interplanar spacing, corresponding to the (1 0 0) crystal plane of MoP 39,40.Furthermore, the EDX elemental mapping analysis was also conducted to verify the above conclusion.As shown in Fig. 3d ande, the C, N, P and Mo elements coexist in the hybrid catalyst, which further supports the uniform distribution of MoP.In addition, the surface morphology of MoP/ CN-20 composite was also investigated and the aggregated MoP particles on CN surface were detected (Fig. S4y). The specific surface areas and pore sizes of all samples were measured by N 2 adsorption-desorption to investigate the textural properties (Table S1.).As shown in Fig. 4a, all the samples display the type IV isotherms with H3 type hysteresis loops, indicating the existence of mesopore.Furthermore, the MoP/CN composites represent a visibly enhanced specific surface area of 88.5, 90.3, 95.1 and 93.6 m 2 /g with increasing MoP content while that for CN is only 69.4 m 2 /g.The increased specific surface area could provide more active sites for reaction.For proving this assumption, the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) of MoP/CN-15 was measured (Fig. S5y).Obviously, the capacitance of MoP/CN-15 with the value 59.44 mF/cm 2 is 1.57 times as high as that of CN (37.87 mF/cm 2 ) (Fig. 4b), which indicates a large surface area with more active sites emerges after the uniform doping of MoP on CN surface. CO 2 adsorption isotherms were also measured to analyze CO 2 adsorption capability quantificationally.As shown in Fig. 4c, all samples exhibit an increased uptake along with the elevated CO 2 pressure.Notably, the MoP/CN-15 composite displays a much higher CO 2 adsorption capacity than that of the pure CN and pure MoP.What's more, the optical absorption properties of the catalysts were also analyzed by UV-vis DRS.In Fig. 4d, the absorption edge of the pure CN is at 480 nm while the bare MoP shows a high absorption intensity throughout the UV and visible-light regions.For the MoP/CN composites, it can be seen that there is no obvious shift of the edge absorption, suggesting the coupling with MoP nanoparticles makes no effect on the structure of the CN.Moreover, the significantly enhanced visible-light absorption in MoP/ CN composites was observed due to the good optical absorption of MoP, which may be helpful for the photocatalytic reaction. To explore the influence of MoP in the hybrid MoP/CN composites, photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction and H 2 evolution under simulated light irradiation were conducted.Meanwhile, control experiments were conducted to distinguish whether the products containing C come from the C based photocatalyst or impurities.No hydrocarbon products are detected with N 2 flow instead of high-purity CO 2 , without illumination or photocatalyst, suggesting that CO 2 , light and photocatalysts are essential for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.As shown in Fig. 5a, CO is detected as the main product in photoreduction and only a trace amount of CH 4 produces.Moreover, O 2 as the oxidation product is also detected (Table S2y).It can be seen that all the MoP/CN composites exhibit significantly enhanced production while the pristine CN exhibits a low CO yield as a function of irradiation time.The CO yields of MoP/CN-15 increase to 5.51 lmol after 6 h illumination (Fig. 5b), which is almost 4.5 times higher than pure CN.The photocatalytic activities of H 2 production were also evaluated to confirm the role of MoP.It can be seen from Fig. 5c, a dramatically improved H 2 production is obtained as expected.Surprisingly, a maximum H 2 yields of 40.38 lmol h A1 is obtained on MoP/CN-15 catalyst, which is almost 75.5 times as high as pure CN.The AQE values of MoP/CN-15 catalyst for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction and H 2 evolution are 3.5 and 18.3 at 420 nm, respectively.What's more, the activity of the optimized photocatalyst is also compared with that of 0.5 wt Pt/CN, which is about 70 of the hydrogen production rate over 0.5 wt Pt loaded CN (57.66 lmol/h).However, the activity would decrease when further increase of MoP content.It may be ascribed to the decreased specific area and the blocked visible-light absorption on account of excessive MoP particles on CN surface.Besides that, the photocatalytic activity at per m 2 was also measured (Fig. S5y), which further confirms the realistic photocatalytic activity of MoP/CN detected above.Moreover, the H 2 evolution rate is much larger than that of CO 2 reduction because the initial activation of CO 2 and the intimate contact between photocatalyst and reactant in water splitting. The stability of the photocatalyts was evaluated through the cyclic test of photocatalytic H 2 evaluation on MoP/CN-15 catalyst.As shown in Fig. 5d, no observable activity decrease is observed through three recycling experiment over 15 h, implying the highstable photocatalytic characteristic of MoP/CN composites.Moreover, the SEM, TEM images and XRD patterns of the MoP/CN-15 photocatalyst before and after the photocatalytic CO 2 reaction and H 2 evolution were also measured to test its stability.The results show that no apparent structural changes appeared (Figs.S4y andS7y). It is generally accepted that the rapid separation and transfer of electron-hole pairs within a photocatalyst play a vital role in photocatalytic activity.Therefore, PL analysis was conducted to investigate the separation efficiency of photogenerated electron-hole pairs.As shown in Fig. 6a, CN has an intensive and broad emission peak centered at 440 nm, which is the typical band-band PL excitation that resulted from the n-p electronic transitions involving nitrogen atoms with lone pairs in CN 41.The PL emission of MoP/g-C 3 N 4 catalysts around at 440-450 nm is much weaker than that of CN, implying the efficient separation of electrons and holes.Obviously, MoP/CN-15 owns the lowest PL emission intensity, which is consistent with the excellent photocatalytic performance. Meanwhile, photocurrent and EIS experiment were also performed to illustrate the enhanced transfer of charges in the MoP/ CN catalysts.As illustrated in Fig. 6b, the uniform and fast photocurrent response appears in six light on-off cycles, indicating the stable charge transfer characteristic of the catalysts.It is easy to notice that MoP/CN-15 catalyst behaves the same characteristic of the carriers transfer with pure CN.The photocurrent exhibits a rapid increase when the light is on and a delayed decrease as the light is off, which may be ascribed to the gradual release of electrons from the doping channels 42.As expected, MoP/CN-15 composite exhibits a higher photocurrent intensity than pure CN, indicating the rapid charge transfer.Moreover, EIS experiment was also carried out to further verify the above conclusion.In Fig. 6c, MoP/CN-15 exhibits a smaller semicircle radius diameter than CN.It is generally accepted that a smaller semicircle radius means a lower resistance in charge transfer, as well as a faster electrons transfer in the hybrid composites 43.Thus the photocurrent response and EIS test show strong evidence of the accelerated electron transfer in MoP/CN-15 catalyst. Furthermore, the time-resolved PL decay spectra were studied to analyze the decay kinetics and the lifetime of photogenerated charge carriers quantitatively.As shown in Fig. 6d, the decay profiles of pure CN and MoP/CN-15 are fitted by a biexponential decay function with the fitting data in the inset.Obviously, the MoP/CN-15 sample exhibits the decreased short (s 1 ), long (s 2 ) and average lifetime (s), indicating that an additional electron decay pathway opens as MoP traps the electrons 44.This phenomenon suggests that more photogenerated carriers may aggregate on MoP/CN-15 and effortlessly captured by the reactants.The results provide a direct and quantified evidence for the PL and photoelectrochemical results discussed above. To further verify the above experimental results, the DFT calculation model for the MoP (0 0 1)/CN (0 0 1) heterojunction was established.The charge density difference was calculated with an isosurface of 0.02 e A A3 for better understanding the charge transfer process between CN and MoP.As shown in Fig. 7a andb, the difference charge density of the heterostructures is defined as follows: Dq 14 q hetero A q CN A q MoP 3 where q hetero , q CN and q MoP are the charge densities of the heterostructures and the isolated components.A general scheme of electron accumulation and depletion could provide insightful information about the charge migration.From the calculated results illustrated in Fig. 7a andb, a strong charge distribution occurs in the interface region of the MoP (0 0 1)/CN (0 0 1) due to the interaction of heterojunction, revealing a significant amount of charge transfer appears.Nonetheless, it is hardly to recognize where the charges deplete and accumulate within the established heterojunction interface.Thereby, the work function (W F ) of this concerned system was analyzed to help us to understand the origin of the charge transfer at the interface.In our calculations, W F for CN (0 0 1) in MoP (0 0 1)/CN (0 0 1) composite, calculated by aligning the Fermi level relative to the vacuum energy level, is found to be 4.73 eV, and for MoP (0 0 1) surface is 6.04 eV (vs.AVS) as shown in Fig. 7c.The results are close to the previous theoretical calculation 20,28293045.Therefore, the electrons will flow from CN to MoP due to the higher W F for MoP, indicating that MoP could act as an ideal electron-acceptor candidate in the composites for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction and water splitting, as depicted in Scheme 1. Combined with the experimental analysis and DFT calculations, the promotion mechanism of MoP co-catalyst on the photocatlytic activity of CN is evident. In succession, the FTIR study was carried out to monitor the CO 2 adsorption and conversion over the photocatalysts.As shown in Fig. 8a, monodentate carbonate (m-CO A2 3 , 1468 and 1539 cm A1 ), bidentate carbonate (b-CO A2 3 , 1329, 1362 and 1574 cm A1 ), carboxylate (CO A 2 , 1267, 1278 and 1678 cm A1 ) and bicarbonate (HCO A 3 , 1234, 1390 and 1424 cm A1 ) are found after the exposure to CO 2 and H 2 O without illumination.The peak at 1642 cm A1 assigned to H 2 O molecular is also emerged 46474849.After the illumination for 60 min, most peaks show minor enhancement with no obvious position changed.Moreover, a new peak at 1510 cm A1 assigned to COO A stretching appears and the peaks ascribing to dCH 2 (1488, 1495 and 1503 cm A1 ) also emerge.The phenomenon indicates a fact that the CO 2 conversion undergoes a multi-step process during the photocatalytic reduction.The intermediate products, such as HCOOH and HCHO, may convert into CO or CH 4 44,50,51.Moreover, the peaks for HCO A 3 and CO A 2 formed from CO 2 interaction with OH groups may be also the possible intermediates for CO 2 photoreduction, and it would decrease or even disappear while the peaks of surface H 2 O and CO A2 3 increase upon irradiation in the previous literatures 46,47,52.However, this phenomenon does not happen in our tests, and the peaks of HCO A 3 and CO A 2 species increase instead of decrease, revealing that HCO A 3 and CO A 2 species are continuously produced during the illumination, which makes for the formation of reduction products. Moreover, Mott-Schottky method was also applied to estimate the band energy levels and carrier densities.As shown in Fig. 8b, the negative slop in both pure CN and MoP/CN-15 indicates the n-type semiconductor characteristics.The flat potentials of CN and MoP/CN-15 are A1.07 and A1.05 V (vs. the Ag/AgCl), namely A0.87 and A0.85 V (vs.NHE) according to the Nernst equation 53.It is generally accepted that the value of the flat potentials of a ntype semiconductor is very close to (0-0.2 V more negative) that of the Fermi level 54,55.Therefore, the CB potentials for CN and MoP/CN-15 are about A1.07 eV and A1.05 eV, respectively.The VB potentials of that are calculated to be 1.58 and 1.45 eV on the basis of its band gaps, respectively.It is easily concluded that the band alignments of the MoP modified CN catalysts meet the requirement for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 and H 2 production.Moreover, it is noteworthy that the slope of MoP/CN-15 is smaller than CN, revealing the increased carrier densities according to the Mott-Schottky equation given as follows 56: where e 0; e; e 0 and N d are the electron charge, the dielectric constant of CN, the permittivity of vacuum and the electron donor density, respectively.With an e value of 3.2 for CN 57, the electrons donor densities of CN and MoP/CN-15 are calculated to be 4:87 A 10 19 cm A3 and 1:32 A 10 20 cm A3 , respectively. In summary, MoP nanoparticles were used as a novel cocatalyst to establish MoP/CN composites for photoreduction CO 2 and photosplitting water.The obtained MoP/CN-15 composite had the highest activity in both CO 2 photoreduction and H 2 production.A maximum CO and H 2 yields of 0.92 lmol h A1 and 40.38 lmol h A1 had been obtained on it, which were 5.5 and 75.5 times as high as pure CN.The corresponding AQE values for CO 2 reduction and H 2 production were 3.5 and 18.3 at 420 nm, respectively, considerably 70 of the hydrogen production rate over 0.5 wt Pt/CN (57.66 lmol h A1 ) under the same experimental conditions.The significant improvement of photocatalytic activity may be explained as follows: (i) the introduction of MoP could effectively separate the photoexcited charges from CN and facilitate the transfer of photogenerated electrons, which is also proven by the DFT calculation results; (ii) the doped MoP could enhance the visible-light absorption capacity; (iii) the introduction MoP nanoparticles increases the activated specific surface area.This study paves a new way to design cost-effective CN based photocatalysts.

Synthesis of g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets (CN) and MoP: CN was synthesized by thermal exfoliated bulk g-C 3 N 4 that obtained by the pyrolysis of urea as reported in our previous work 26.MoP was synthesized by typical temperature programmed reduction (TPR) method under H 2 atmosphere reported in a previous study 27. Synthesis of MoP/CN: The solution contained 50 mL deionized water, 0.5 g CN and a quantity of MoP were sonicated for 2 h and stirred vigorously overnight.Then the solution was dried at 80 C and the resulting products were calcined in Ar atmosphere at 350 C for 2 h.Finally, the MoP/CN composites were obtained and denoted as MoP/CN-x, where x (x 5, 10, 15, 20) represented the mass percentage of MoP. Photoelectrochemical measurements were proceeded on a standard three-electrode (CHI 660E, Chenhua, China).The working electrode was the FTO glass deposited catalysts while the counter electrode and reference electrode were Pt and Ag/AgCl, respectively.The electrolyte solution was 0.5 M Na 2 SO 4 solution.The working electrode was prepared as follows: CN and MoP/CN-15 were dispersed in 1 mL ethanol contained 20 lL nafion aqueous solution (5 wt), respectively, with ultrasonically treatment for 2 h.In succession, the resulting suspension was added dropwise on the FTO glass (1 cm 2 ) and evaporated to dry.The cyclic voltammetry (CV) was measured in 1.0 M KOH solution without illumination. In-situ Fourier transform Infrared spectroscopy(FTIR) was conducted to gain insights into the interaction of CO 2 and H 2 O vapor with the photocatalyst during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, as well as the conversion process of adsorption species and reaction intermediates during the reaction.The FTIR setup was descripted in Fig. S1y and the experiment was conducted as follows.Firstly, the catalyst was purged with Ar atmosphere at 200 C for 120 min to remove the residual water and other impurities on its surface.Secondly, the background spectrum was acquired when the temperature drops to 30 C and the first peak was acquired after that.Thirdly, the second peak was acquired after absorption of the CO 2 and H 2 O mixture vapor for 60 min.Finally, the light was on and the third peak was collected after illumination for 60 min. DFT calculations were carried out by exploiting the DMol3 codes that are included into Materials Studio 7.0 software.The (0 0 1) surface of CN and MoP that widely studied before was chosen for the theoretical computation in this paper 19,20,282930.For the geometry optimization and total energy calculation, conventional generalized gradient approximation (GGA) method with the Perdew-Burke-Eznerhof (PBE) exchange-correlation functional was applied.The k-points were adopted in 2 A 2 A 1 Monkhorst-Pack grid, and the DFT-D2 was chosen for the dispersion correction.DFT Semi-core Pseudopots (DSPP) pseudopotential was employed to treat the core electrons and the real space cutoff radius was maintained as 4.4 A.The vacuum space perpendicular was around 30 A, which was large enough to avoid the interaction between periodic images.The convergence criteria for energy was 1 A 10 A5 Ha while it for displacement of geometry optimization was 5 A 10 A3 A. The photocatalytic performance for CO 2 reduction and H 2 production were performed at Labsolar-6A system (Perfect Light Co., China) using a 300 W Xenon-arc lamp with a 3 AM 1.5 G filter to simulate sunlight irradiation.The 0.5 wt Pt /CN was synthesized by the in situ photodeposition method using H 2 PtCl 6 as the starting material.For a typical test in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, 50 mg photocatalyst was suspended in 100 mL deionized water.The obtained solution was vacuum-treated for 30 min under continuously stirring.Then the suspension was filled with CO 2 (99.999) at 100 kPa for 30 min to reach the equilibrium of adsorptiondesorption.After that the experiments began as the light was on.The photocatalytic H 2 production was conducted with a similar procedure except that the solution that contained 80 mL deionized water and 20 mL triethanolamine (TEOA) replacing the 100 mL deionized water and without CO 2 passed.The gas chromatograph (GC-2010 Plus, SHIMADZU, Japan) was used to test the products in our test.The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) at 420 nm (AE10 nm) wavelength was estimated via the following equation: 3. Results and discussion The XRD pattern of MoP is depicted in Fig. 1a.The main characteristic peaks can be assigned to the typical crystal facets of MoP (JCPDS PDF24-0771), which are in accordance with the previous reports 24.No impurity peaks are detected in the MoP, suggesting that a pure crystalline compound existed.For the MoP/CN composites in Fig. 1b, the peaks at 27.5and 13.1that belong to the (0 0 2) and (1 0 0) reflections of CN can be found in all the samples, indicating the interlayer-stacking of conjugated aromatic systems and in-plane tri-s-triazine units packing motif, respectively 31.With the increasing MoP content in the composites, the diffraction peaks of CN become broader and its intensity decreases gradually, whereas the diffraction peaks of MoP become stronger. The surface chemical compositions of the catalysts were further elucidated by XPS experiments.The survey scan XPS spectrum (Fig. S2y) reveals the co-existence of C, N, Mo and P elements in MoP/CN-15, which is also confirmed by the following EDX elemental mapping analysis.Furthermore, the spectra of O 1s also emerges due to the MoO x and absorbed gaseous oxygen molecules on the surface.What's more, the corresponding high-resolution XPS spectra were also investigated.As shown in Fig. 2a andb, the peaks of C 1s at 284.8 eV and 288.3 eV and the peaks of N 1s at 398.8 eV/400.6 eV/404.4eV confirm the presence of CN 32.The Mo 3d spectrum in Fig. 2c could be resolved into four peaks.The former peaks located at 228.2 eV and 231.6 eV are corresponding to the positively charged Mo in MoP (227.6 eV for Mo 0 ), while the rest of the Mo 3d peaks located at 232.2 eV and 235.4 eV are assigned to MoO x that formed by the passivation during the synthesis process 19,33,34.In Fig. 2d, the dominated peaks at 129.4 eV and 130.1 eV reveal the negatively charged P character in MoP (130.2 eV for P 0 ) 25.The peak at 133.9 eV represents the characteristic oxidation peak of phosphorous 353637. SEM and TEM images reveal the surface morphology and size of the catalysts.As depicted in Fig. S3y, the bulk g-C 3 N 4 without thermal exfoliation presents a typical lamellar structure with smooth surface and irregular curly edge.When the bulk g-C 3 N 4 was thermally treated, the hydrogen-bonds connecting the polymeric melon units in the layers are not stable enough against thermal oxidation process in air and the Van der Waals force between the layers will be broken 38.It is obvious that the CN exhibits a thin and porous flaky structure (Fig. S3y).As for the pure MoP in Fig. S3y, it is interesting to find there are two kinds of morphologies, fragmentized flake and agglomerated nanoparticles with some holes.The morphological characteristics was further verified by TEM observations.It can be seen that the sheet like MoP owns a great deal of pores with the diameter ranging in 50-80 nm (Fig. 3a), while the MoP nanoparticles even with some agglomerated clusters, possess the particle sizes ranging from 30 to 50 nm (Fig. 3b).For the hybrid MoP/CN-15 composite in Fig. S3y, a uniform flaky structure, inheriting the morphology of CN is observed, revealing that the MoP nanoparticles are intimately anchored onto the CN surface by the physical interaction and further calcination.The same conclusion can also be available for the TEM image in the inset image of Fig. 3c.Moreover, a HR-TEM image of local MoP/CN-15 in Fig. 3c shows a 0.280 nm interplanar spacing, corresponding to the (1 0 0) crystal plane of MoP 39,40.Furthermore, the EDX elemental mapping analysis was also conducted to verify the above conclusion.As shown in Fig. 3d ande, the C, N, P and Mo elements coexist in the hybrid catalyst, which further supports the uniform distribution of MoP.In addition, the surface morphology of MoP/ CN-20 composite was also investigated and the aggregated MoP particles on CN surface were detected (Fig. S4y). The specific surface areas and pore sizes of all samples were measured by N 2 adsorption-desorption to investigate the textural properties (Table S1.).As shown in Fig. 4a, all the samples display the type IV isotherms with H3 type hysteresis loops, indicating the existence of mesopore.Furthermore, the MoP/CN composites represent a visibly enhanced specific surface area of 88.5, 90.3, 95.1 and 93.6 m 2 /g with increasing MoP content while that for CN is only 69.4 m 2 /g.The increased specific surface area could provide more active sites for reaction.For proving this assumption, the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) of MoP/CN-15 was measured (Fig. S5y).Obviously, the capacitance of MoP/CN-15 with the value 59.44 mF/cm 2 is 1.57 times as high as that of CN (37.87 mF/cm 2 ) (Fig. 4b), which indicates a large surface area with more active sites emerges after the uniform doping of MoP on CN surface. CO 2 adsorption isotherms were also measured to analyze CO 2 adsorption capability quantificationally.As shown in Fig. 4c, all samples exhibit an increased uptake along with the elevated CO 2 pressure.Notably, the MoP/CN-15 composite displays a much higher CO 2 adsorption capacity than that of the pure CN and pure MoP.What's more, the optical absorption properties of the catalysts were also analyzed by UV-vis DRS.In Fig. 4d, the absorption edge of the pure CN is at 480 nm while the bare MoP shows a high absorption intensity throughout the UV and visible-light regions.For the MoP/CN composites, it can be seen that there is no obvious shift of the edge absorption, suggesting the coupling with MoP nanoparticles makes no effect on the structure of the CN.Moreover, the significantly enhanced visible-light absorption in MoP/ CN composites was observed due to the good optical absorption of MoP, which may be helpful for the photocatalytic reaction. To explore the influence of MoP in the hybrid MoP/CN composites, photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction and H 2 evolution under simulated light irradiation were conducted.Meanwhile, control experiments were conducted to distinguish whether the products containing C come from the C based photocatalyst or impurities.No hydrocarbon products are detected with N 2 flow instead of high-purity CO 2 , without illumination or photocatalyst, suggesting that CO 2 , light and photocatalysts are essential for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.As shown in Fig. 5a, CO is detected as the main product in photoreduction and only a trace amount of CH 4 produces.Moreover, O 2 as the oxidation product is also detected (Table S2y).It can be seen that all the MoP/CN composites exhibit significantly enhanced production while the pristine CN exhibits a low CO yield as a function of irradiation time.The CO yields of MoP/CN-15 increase to 5.51 lmol after 6 h illumination (Fig. 5b), which is almost 4.5 times higher than pure CN.The photocatalytic activities of H 2 production were also evaluated to confirm the role of MoP.It can be seen from Fig. 5c, a dramatically improved H 2 production is obtained as expected.Surprisingly, a maximum H 2 yields of 40.38 lmol h A1 is obtained on MoP/CN-15 catalyst, which is almost 75.5 times as high as pure CN.The AQE values of MoP/CN-15 catalyst for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction and H 2 evolution are 3.5 and 18.3 at 420 nm, respectively.What's more, the activity of the optimized photocatalyst is also compared with that of 0.5 wt Pt/CN, which is about 70 of the hydrogen production rate over 0.5 wt Pt loaded CN (57.66 lmol/h).However, the activity would decrease when further increase of MoP content.It may be ascribed to the decreased specific area and the blocked visible-light absorption on account of excessive MoP particles on CN surface.Besides that, the photocatalytic activity at per m 2 was also measured (Fig. S5y), which further confirms the realistic photocatalytic activity of MoP/CN detected above.Moreover, the H 2 evolution rate is much larger than that of CO 2 reduction because the initial activation of CO 2 and the intimate contact between photocatalyst and reactant in water splitting. The stability of the photocatalyts was evaluated through the cyclic test of photocatalytic H 2 evaluation on MoP/CN-15 catalyst.As shown in Fig. 5d, no observable activity decrease is observed through three recycling experiment over 15 h, implying the highstable photocatalytic characteristic of MoP/CN composites.Moreover, the SEM, TEM images and XRD patterns of the MoP/CN-15 photocatalyst before and after the photocatalytic CO 2 reaction and H 2 evolution were also measured to test its stability.The results show that no apparent structural changes appeared (Figs.S4y andS7y). It is generally accepted that the rapid separation and transfer of electron-hole pairs within a photocatalyst play a vital role in photocatalytic activity.Therefore, PL analysis was conducted to investigate the separation efficiency of photogenerated electron-hole pairs.As shown in Fig. 6a, CN has an intensive and broad emission peak centered at 440 nm, which is the typical band-band PL excitation that resulted from the n-p electronic transitions involving nitrogen atoms with lone pairs in CN 41.The PL emission of MoP/g-C 3 N 4 catalysts around at 440-450 nm is much weaker than that of CN, implying the efficient separation of electrons and holes.Obviously, MoP/CN-15 owns the lowest PL emission intensity, which is consistent with the excellent photocatalytic performance. Meanwhile, photocurrent and EIS experiment were also performed to illustrate the enhanced transfer of charges in the MoP/ CN catalysts.As illustrated in Fig. 6b, the uniform and fast photocurrent response appears in six light on-off cycles, indicating the stable charge transfer characteristic of the catalysts.It is easy to notice that MoP/CN-15 catalyst behaves the same characteristic of the carriers transfer with pure CN.The photocurrent exhibits a rapid increase when the light is on and a delayed decrease as the light is off, which may be ascribed to the gradual release of electrons from the doping channels 42.As expected, MoP/CN-15 composite exhibits a higher photocurrent intensity than pure CN, indicating the rapid charge transfer.Moreover, EIS experiment was also carried out to further verify the above conclusion.In Fig. 6c, MoP/CN-15 exhibits a smaller semicircle radius diameter than CN.It is generally accepted that a smaller semicircle radius means a lower resistance in charge transfer, as well as a faster electrons transfer in the hybrid composites 43.Thus the photocurrent response and EIS test show strong evidence of the accelerated electron transfer in MoP/CN-15 catalyst. Furthermore, the time-resolved PL decay spectra were studied to analyze the decay kinetics and the lifetime of photogenerated charge carriers quantitatively.As shown in Fig. 6d, the decay profiles of pure CN and MoP/CN-15 are fitted by a biexponential decay function with the fitting data in the inset.Obviously, the MoP/CN-15 sample exhibits the decreased short (s 1 ), long (s 2 ) and average lifetime (s), indicating that an additional electron decay pathway opens as MoP traps the electrons 44.This phenomenon suggests that more photogenerated carriers may aggregate on MoP/CN-15 and effortlessly captured by the reactants.The results provide a direct and quantified evidence for the PL and photoelectrochemical results discussed above. To further verify the above experimental results, the DFT calculation model for the MoP (0 0 1)/CN (0 0 1) heterojunction was established.The charge density difference was calculated with an isosurface of 0.02 e A A3 for better understanding the charge transfer process between CN and MoP.As shown in Fig. 7a andb, the difference charge density of the heterostructures is defined as follows: Dq 14 q hetero A q CN A q MoP 3 where q hetero , q CN and q MoP are the charge densities of the heterostructures and the isolated components.A general scheme of electron accumulation and depletion could provide insightful information about the charge migration.From the calculated results illustrated in Fig. 7a andb, a strong charge distribution occurs in the interface region of the MoP (0 0 1)/CN (0 0 1) due to the interaction of heterojunction, revealing a significant amount of charge transfer appears.Nonetheless, it is hardly to recognize where the charges deplete and accumulate within the established heterojunction interface.Thereby, the work function (W F ) of this concerned system was analyzed to help us to understand the origin of the charge transfer at the interface.In our calculations, W F for CN (0 0 1) in MoP (0 0 1)/CN (0 0 1) composite, calculated by aligning the Fermi level relative to the vacuum energy level, is found to be 4.73 eV, and for MoP (0 0 1) surface is 6.04 eV (vs.AVS) as shown in Fig. 7c.The results are close to the previous theoretical calculation 20,28293045.Therefore, the electrons will flow from CN to MoP due to the higher W F for MoP, indicating that MoP could act as an ideal electron-acceptor candidate in the composites for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction and water splitting, as depicted in Scheme 1. Combined with the experimental analysis and DFT calculations, the promotion mechanism of MoP co-catalyst on the photocatlytic activity of CN is evident. In succession, the FTIR study was carried out to monitor the CO 2 adsorption and conversion over the photocatalysts.As shown in Fig. 8a, monodentate carbonate (m-CO A2 3 , 1468 and 1539 cm A1 ), bidentate carbonate (b-CO A2 3 , 1329, 1362 and 1574 cm A1 ), carboxylate (CO A 2 , 1267, 1278 and 1678 cm A1 ) and bicarbonate (HCO A 3 , 1234, 1390 and 1424 cm A1 ) are found after the exposure to CO 2 and H 2 O without illumination.The peak at 1642 cm A1 assigned to H 2 O molecular is also emerged 46474849.After the illumination for 60 min, most peaks show minor enhancement with no obvious position changed.Moreover, a new peak at 1510 cm A1 assigned to COO A stretching appears and the peaks ascribing to dCH 2 (1488, 1495 and 1503 cm A1 ) also emerge.The phenomenon indicates a fact that the CO 2 conversion undergoes a multi-step process during the photocatalytic reduction.The intermediate products, such as HCOOH and HCHO, may convert into CO or CH 4 44,50,51.Moreover, the peaks for HCO A 3 and CO A 2 formed from CO 2 interaction with OH groups may be also the possible intermediates for CO 2 photoreduction, and it would decrease or even disappear while the peaks of surface H 2 O and CO A2 3 increase upon irradiation in the previous literatures 46,47,52.However, this phenomenon does not happen in our tests, and the peaks of HCO A 3 and CO A 2 species increase instead of decrease, revealing that HCO A 3 and CO A 2 species are continuously produced during the illumination, which makes for the formation of reduction products. Moreover, Mott-Schottky method was also applied to estimate the band energy levels and carrier densities.As shown in Fig. 8b, the negative slop in both pure CN and MoP/CN-15 indicates the n-type semiconductor characteristics.The flat potentials of CN and MoP/CN-15 are A1.07 and A1.05 V (vs. the Ag/AgCl), namely A0.87 and A0.85 V (vs.NHE) according to the Nernst equation 53.It is generally accepted that the value of the flat potentials of a ntype semiconductor is very close to (0-0.2 V more negative) that of the Fermi level 54,55.Therefore, the CB potentials for CN and MoP/CN-15 are about A1.07 eV and A1.05 eV, respectively.The VB potentials of that are calculated to be 1.58 and 1.45 eV on the basis of its band gaps, respectively.It is easily concluded that the band alignments of the MoP modified CN catalysts meet the requirement for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 and H 2 production.Moreover, it is noteworthy that the slope of MoP/CN-15 is smaller than CN, revealing the increased carrier densities according to the Mott-Schottky equation given as follows 56: where e 0; e; e 0 and N d are the electron charge, the dielectric constant of CN, the permittivity of vacuum and the electron donor density, respectively.With an e value of 3.2 for CN 57, the electrons donor densities of CN and MoP/CN-15 are calculated to be 4:87 A 10 19 cm A3 and 1:32 A 10 20 cm A3 , respectively. In summary, MoP nanoparticles were used as a novel cocatalyst to establish MoP/CN composites for photoreduction CO 2 and photosplitting water.The obtained MoP/CN-15 composite had the highest activity in both CO 2 photoreduction and H 2 production.A maximum CO and H 2 yields of 0.92 lmol h A1 and 40.38 lmol h A1 had been obtained on it, which were 5.5 and 75.5 times as high as pure CN.The corresponding AQE values for CO 2 reduction and H 2 production were 3.5 and 18.3 at 420 nm, respectively, considerably 70 of the hydrogen production rate over 0.5 wt Pt/CN (57.66 lmol h A1 ) under the same experimental conditions.The significant improvement of photocatalytic activity may be explained as follows: (i) the introduction of MoP could effectively separate the photoexcited charges from CN and facilitate the transfer of photogenerated electrons, which is also proven by the DFT calculation results; (ii) the doped MoP could enhance the visible-light absorption capacity; (iii) the introduction MoP nanoparticles increases the activated specific surface area.This study paves a new way to design cost-effective CN based photocatalysts.

Synthesis of g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets (CN) and MoP: CN was synthesized by thermal exfoliated bulk g-C 3 N 4 that obtained by the pyrolysis of urea as reported in our previous work 26.MoP was synthesized by typical temperature programmed reduction (TPR) method under H 2 atmosphere reported in a previous study 27. Synthesis of MoP/CN: The solution contained 50 mL deionized water, 0.5 g CN and a quantity of MoP were sonicated for 2 h and stirred vigorously overnight.Then the solution was dried at 80 C and the resulting products were calcined in Ar atmosphere at 350 C for 2 h.Finally, the MoP/CN composites were obtained and denoted as MoP/CN-x, where x (x 5, 10, 15, 20) represented the mass percentage of MoP. Photoelectrochemical measurements were proceeded on a standard three-electrode (CHI 660E, Chenhua, China).The working electrode was the FTO glass deposited catalysts while the counter electrode and reference electrode were Pt and Ag/AgCl, respectively.The electrolyte solution was 0.5 M Na 2 SO 4 solution.The working electrode was prepared as follows: CN and MoP/CN-15 were dispersed in 1 mL ethanol contained 20 lL nafion aqueous solution (5 wt), respectively, with ultrasonically treatment for 2 h.In succession, the resulting suspension was added dropwise on the FTO glass (1 cm 2 ) and evaporated to dry.The cyclic voltammetry (CV) was measured in 1.0 M KOH solution without illumination. In-situ Fourier transform Infrared spectroscopy(FTIR) was conducted to gain insights into the interaction of CO 2 and H 2 O vapor with the photocatalyst during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, as well as the conversion process of adsorption species and reaction intermediates during the reaction.The FTIR setup was descripted in Fig. S1y and the experiment was conducted as follows.Firstly, the catalyst was purged with Ar atmosphere at 200 C for 120 min to remove the residual water and other impurities on its surface.Secondly, the background spectrum was acquired when the temperature drops to 30 C and the first peak was acquired after that.Thirdly, the second peak was acquired after absorption of the CO 2 and H 2 O mixture vapor for 60 min.Finally, the light was on and the third peak was collected after illumination for 60 min. DFT calculations were carried out by exploiting the DMol3 codes that are included into Materials Studio 7.0 software.The (0 0 1) surface of CN and MoP that widely studied before was chosen for the theoretical computation in this paper 19,20,282930.For the geometry optimization and total energy calculation, conventional generalized gradient approximation (GGA) method with the Perdew-Burke-Eznerhof (PBE) exchange-correlation functional was applied.The k-points were adopted in 2 A 2 A 1 Monkhorst-Pack grid, and the DFT-D2 was chosen for the dispersion correction.DFT Semi-core Pseudopots (DSPP) pseudopotential was employed to treat the core electrons and the real space cutoff radius was maintained as 4.4 A.The vacuum space perpendicular was around 30 A, which was large enough to avoid the interaction between periodic images.The convergence criteria for energy was 1 A 10 A5 Ha while it for displacement of geometry optimization was 5 A 10 A3 A. The photocatalytic performance for CO 2 reduction and H 2 production were performed at Labsolar-6A system (Perfect Light Co., China) using a 300 W Xenon-arc lamp with a 3 AM 1.5 G filter to simulate sunlight irradiation.The 0.5 wt Pt /CN was synthesized by the in situ photodeposition method using H 2 PtCl 6 as the starting material.For a typical test in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, 50 mg photocatalyst was suspended in 100 mL deionized water.The obtained solution was vacuum-treated for 30 min under continuously stirring.Then the suspension was filled with CO 2 (99.999) at 100 kPa for 30 min to reach the equilibrium of adsorptiondesorption.After that the experiments began as the light was on.The photocatalytic H 2 production was conducted with a similar procedure except that the solution that contained 80 mL deionized water and 20 mL triethanolamine (TEOA) replacing the 100 mL deionized water and without CO 2 passed.The gas chromatograph (GC-2010 Plus, SHIMADZU, Japan) was used to test the products in our test.The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) at 420 nm (AE10 nm) wavelength was estimated via the following equation: 3. Results and discussion The XRD pattern of MoP is depicted in Fig. 1a.The main characteristic peaks can be assigned to the typical crystal facets of MoP (JCPDS PDF24-0771), which are in accordance with the previous reports 24.No impurity peaks are detected in the MoP, suggesting that a pure crystalline compound existed.For the MoP/CN composites in Fig. 1b, the peaks at 27.5and 13.1that belong to the (0 0 2) and (1 0 0) reflections of CN can be found in all the samples, indicating the interlayer-stacking of conjugated aromatic systems and in-plane tri-s-triazine units packing motif, respectively 31.With the increasing MoP content in the composites, the diffraction peaks of CN become broader and its intensity decreases gradually, whereas the diffraction peaks of MoP become stronger. The surface chemical compositions of the catalysts were further elucidated by XPS experiments.The survey scan XPS spectrum (Fig. S2y) reveals the co-existence of C, N, Mo and P elements in MoP/CN-15, which is also confirmed by the following EDX elemental mapping analysis.Furthermore, the spectra of O 1s also emerges due to the MoO x and absorbed gaseous oxygen molecules on the surface.What's more, the corresponding high-resolution XPS spectra were also investigated.As shown in Fig. 2a andb, the peaks of C 1s at 284.8 eV and 288.3 eV and the peaks of N 1s at 398.8 eV/400.6 eV/404.4eV confirm the presence of CN 32.The Mo 3d spectrum in Fig. 2c could be resolved into four peaks.The former peaks located at 228.2 eV and 231.6 eV are corresponding to the positively charged Mo in MoP (227.6 eV for Mo 0 ), while the rest of the Mo 3d peaks located at 232.2 eV and 235.4 eV are assigned to MoO x that formed by the passivation during the synthesis process 19,33,34.In Fig. 2d, the dominated peaks at 129.4 eV and 130.1 eV reveal the negatively charged P character in MoP (130.2 eV for P 0 ) 25.The peak at 133.9 eV represents the characteristic oxidation peak of phosphorous 353637. SEM and TEM images reveal the surface morphology and size of the catalysts.As depicted in Fig. S3y, the bulk g-C 3 N 4 without thermal exfoliation presents a typical lamellar structure with smooth surface and irregular curly edge.When the bulk g-C 3 N 4 was thermally treated, the hydrogen-bonds connecting the polymeric melon units in the layers are not stable enough against thermal oxidation process in air and the Van der Waals force between the layers will be broken 38.It is obvious that the CN exhibits a thin and porous flaky structure (Fig. S3y).As for the pure MoP in Fig. S3y, it is interesting to find there are two kinds of morphologies, fragmentized flake and agglomerated nanoparticles with some holes.The morphological characteristics was further verified by TEM observations.It can be seen that the sheet like MoP owns a great deal of pores with the diameter ranging in 50-80 nm (Fig. 3a), while the MoP nanoparticles even with some agglomerated clusters, possess the particle sizes ranging from 30 to 50 nm (Fig. 3b).For the hybrid MoP/CN-15 composite in Fig. S3y, a uniform flaky structure, inheriting the morphology of CN is observed, revealing that the MoP nanoparticles are intimately anchored onto the CN surface by the physical interaction and further calcination.The same conclusion can also be available for the TEM image in the inset image of Fig. 3c.Moreover, a HR-TEM image of local MoP/CN-15 in Fig. 3c shows a 0.280 nm interplanar spacing, corresponding to the (1 0 0) crystal plane of MoP 39,40.Furthermore, the EDX elemental mapping analysis was also conducted to verify the above conclusion.As shown in Fig. 3d ande, the C, N, P and Mo elements coexist in the hybrid catalyst, which further supports the uniform distribution of MoP.In addition, the surface morphology of MoP/ CN-20 composite was also investigated and the aggregated MoP particles on CN surface were detected (Fig. S4y). The specific surface areas and pore sizes of all samples were measured by N 2 adsorption-desorption to investigate the textural properties (Table S1.).As shown in Fig. 4a, all the samples display the type IV isotherms with H3 type hysteresis loops, indicating the existence of mesopore.Furthermore, the MoP/CN composites represent a visibly enhanced specific surface area of 88.5, 90.3, 95.1 and 93.6 m 2 /g with increasing MoP content while that for CN is only 69.4 m 2 /g.The increased specific surface area could provide more active sites for reaction.For proving this assumption, the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) of MoP/CN-15 was measured (Fig. S5y).Obviously, the capacitance of MoP/CN-15 with the value 59.44 mF/cm 2 is 1.57 times as high as that of CN (37.87 mF/cm 2 ) (Fig. 4b), which indicates a large surface area with more active sites emerges after the uniform doping of MoP on CN surface. CO 2 adsorption isotherms were also measured to analyze CO 2 adsorption capability quantificationally.As shown in Fig. 4c, all samples exhibit an increased uptake along with the elevated CO 2 pressure.Notably, the MoP/CN-15 composite displays a much higher CO 2 adsorption capacity than that of the pure CN and pure MoP.What's more, the optical absorption properties of the catalysts were also analyzed by UV-vis DRS.In Fig. 4d, the absorption edge of the pure CN is at 480 nm while the bare MoP shows a high absorption intensity throughout the UV and visible-light regions.For the MoP/CN composites, it can be seen that there is no obvious shift of the edge absorption, suggesting the coupling with MoP nanoparticles makes no effect on the structure of the CN.Moreover, the significantly enhanced visible-light absorption in MoP/ CN composites was observed due to the good optical absorption of MoP, which may be helpful for the photocatalytic reaction. To explore the influence of MoP in the hybrid MoP/CN composites, photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction and H 2 evolution under simulated light irradiation were conducted.Meanwhile, control experiments were conducted to distinguish whether the products containing C come from the C based photocatalyst or impurities.No hydrocarbon products are detected with N 2 flow instead of high-purity CO 2 , without illumination or photocatalyst, suggesting that CO 2 , light and photocatalysts are essential for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.As shown in Fig. 5a, CO is detected as the main product in photoreduction and only a trace amount of CH 4 produces.Moreover, O 2 as the oxidation product is also detected (Table S2y).It can be seen that all the MoP/CN composites exhibit significantly enhanced production while the pristine CN exhibits a low CO yield as a function of irradiation time.The CO yields of MoP/CN-15 increase to 5.51 lmol after 6 h illumination (Fig. 5b), which is almost 4.5 times higher than pure CN.The photocatalytic activities of H 2 production were also evaluated to confirm the role of MoP.It can be seen from Fig. 5c, a dramatically improved H 2 production is obtained as expected.Surprisingly, a maximum H 2 yields of 40.38 lmol h A1 is obtained on MoP/CN-15 catalyst, which is almost 75.5 times as high as pure CN.The AQE values of MoP/CN-15 catalyst for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction and H 2 evolution are 3.5 and 18.3 at 420 nm, respectively.What's more, the activity of the optimized photocatalyst is also compared with that of 0.5 wt Pt/CN, which is about 70 of the hydrogen production rate over 0.5 wt Pt loaded CN (57.66 lmol/h).However, the activity would decrease when further increase of MoP content.It may be ascribed to the decreased specific area and the blocked visible-light absorption on account of excessive MoP particles on CN surface.Besides that, the photocatalytic activity at per m 2 was also measured (Fig. S5y), which further confirms the realistic photocatalytic activity of MoP/CN detected above.Moreover, the H 2 evolution rate is much larger than that of CO 2 reduction because the initial activation of CO 2 and the intimate contact between photocatalyst and reactant in water splitting. The stability of the photocatalyts was evaluated through the cyclic test of photocatalytic H 2 evaluation on MoP/CN-15 catalyst.As shown in Fig. 5d, no observable activity decrease is observed through three recycling experiment over 15 h, implying the highstable photocatalytic characteristic of MoP/CN composites.Moreover, the SEM, TEM images and XRD patterns of the MoP/CN-15 photocatalyst before and after the photocatalytic CO 2 reaction and H 2 evolution were also measured to test its stability.The results show that no apparent structural changes appeared (Figs.S4y andS7y). It is generally accepted that the rapid separation and transfer of electron-hole pairs within a photocatalyst play a vital role in photocatalytic activity.Therefore, PL analysis was conducted to investigate the separation efficiency of photogenerated electron-hole pairs.As shown in Fig. 6a, CN has an intensive and broad emission peak centered at 440 nm, which is the typical band-band PL excitation that resulted from the n-p electronic transitions involving nitrogen atoms with lone pairs in CN 41.The PL emission of MoP/g-C 3 N 4 catalysts around at 440-450 nm is much weaker than that of CN, implying the efficient separation of electrons and holes.Obviously, MoP/CN-15 owns the lowest PL emission intensity, which is consistent with the excellent photocatalytic performance. Meanwhile, photocurrent and EIS experiment were also performed to illustrate the enhanced transfer of charges in the MoP/ CN catalysts.As illustrated in Fig. 6b, the uniform and fast photocurrent response appears in six light on-off cycles, indicating the stable charge transfer characteristic of the catalysts.It is easy to notice that MoP/CN-15 catalyst behaves the same characteristic of the carriers transfer with pure CN.The photocurrent exhibits a rapid increase when the light is on and a delayed decrease as the light is off, which may be ascribed to the gradual release of electrons from the doping channels 42.As expected, MoP/CN-15 composite exhibits a higher photocurrent intensity than pure CN, indicating the rapid charge transfer.Moreover, EIS experiment was also carried out to further verify the above conclusion.In Fig. 6c, MoP/CN-15 exhibits a smaller semicircle radius diameter than CN.It is generally accepted that a smaller semicircle radius means a lower resistance in charge transfer, as well as a faster electrons transfer in the hybrid composites 43.Thus the photocurrent response and EIS test show strong evidence of the accelerated electron transfer in MoP/CN-15 catalyst. Furthermore, the time-resolved PL decay spectra were studied to analyze the decay kinetics and the lifetime of photogenerated charge carriers quantitatively.As shown in Fig. 6d, the decay profiles of pure CN and MoP/CN-15 are fitted by a biexponential decay function with the fitting data in the inset.Obviously, the MoP/CN-15 sample exhibits the decreased short (s 1 ), long (s 2 ) and average lifetime (s), indicating that an additional electron decay pathway opens as MoP traps the electrons 44.This phenomenon suggests that more photogenerated carriers may aggregate on MoP/CN-15 and effortlessly captured by the reactants.The results provide a direct and quantified evidence for the PL and photoelectrochemical results discussed above. To further verify the above experimental results, the DFT calculation model for the MoP (0 0 1)/CN (0 0 1) heterojunction was established.The charge density difference was calculated with an isosurface of 0.02 e A A3 for better understanding the charge transfer process between CN and MoP.As shown in Fig. 7a andb, the difference charge density of the heterostructures is defined as follows: Dq 14 q hetero A q CN A q MoP 3 where q hetero , q CN and q MoP are the charge densities of the heterostructures and the isolated components.A general scheme of electron accumulation and depletion could provide insightful information about the charge migration.From the calculated results illustrated in Fig. 7a andb, a strong charge distribution occurs in the interface region of the MoP (0 0 1)/CN (0 0 1) due to the interaction of heterojunction, revealing a significant amount of charge transfer appears.Nonetheless, it is hardly to recognize where the charges deplete and accumulate within the established heterojunction interface.Thereby, the work function (W F ) of this concerned system was analyzed to help us to understand the origin of the charge transfer at the interface.In our calculations, W F for CN (0 0 1) in MoP (0 0 1)/CN (0 0 1) composite, calculated by aligning the Fermi level relative to the vacuum energy level, is found to be 4.73 eV, and for MoP (0 0 1) surface is 6.04 eV (vs.AVS) as shown in Fig. 7c.The results are close to the previous theoretical calculation 20,28293045.Therefore, the electrons will flow from CN to MoP due to the higher W F for MoP, indicating that MoP could act as an ideal electron-acceptor candidate in the composites for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction and water splitting, as depicted in Scheme 1. Combined with the experimental analysis and DFT calculations, the promotion mechanism of MoP co-catalyst on the photocatlytic activity of CN is evident. In succession, the FTIR study was carried out to monitor the CO 2 adsorption and conversion over the photocatalysts.As shown in Fig. 8a, monodentate carbonate (m-CO A2 3 , 1468 and 1539 cm A1 ), bidentate carbonate (b-CO A2 3 , 1329, 1362 and 1574 cm A1 ), carboxylate (CO A 2 , 1267, 1278 and 1678 cm A1 ) and bicarbonate (HCO A 3 , 1234, 1390 and 1424 cm A1 ) are found after the exposure to CO 2 and H 2 O without illumination.The peak at 1642 cm A1 assigned to H 2 O molecular is also emerged 46474849.After the illumination for 60 min, most peaks show minor enhancement with no obvious position changed.Moreover, a new peak at 1510 cm A1 assigned to COO A stretching appears and the peaks ascribing to dCH 2 (1488, 1495 and 1503 cm A1 ) also emerge.The phenomenon indicates a fact that the CO 2 conversion undergoes a multi-step process during the photocatalytic reduction.The intermediate products, such as HCOOH and HCHO, may convert into CO or CH 4 44,50,51.Moreover, the peaks for HCO A 3 and CO A 2 formed from CO 2 interaction with OH groups may be also the possible intermediates for CO 2 photoreduction, and it would decrease or even disappear while the peaks of surface H 2 O and CO A2 3 increase upon irradiation in the previous literatures 46,47,52.However, this phenomenon does not happen in our tests, and the peaks of HCO A 3 and CO A 2 species increase instead of decrease, revealing that HCO A 3 and CO A 2 species are continuously produced during the illumination, which makes for the formation of reduction products. Moreover, Mott-Schottky method was also applied to estimate the band energy levels and carrier densities.As shown in Fig. 8b, the negative slop in both pure CN and MoP/CN-15 indicates the n-type semiconductor characteristics.The flat potentials of CN and MoP/CN-15 are A1.07 and A1.05 V (vs. the Ag/AgCl), namely A0.87 and A0.85 V (vs.NHE) according to the Nernst equation 53.It is generally accepted that the value of the flat potentials of a ntype semiconductor is very close to (0-0.2 V more negative) that of the Fermi level 54,55.Therefore, the CB potentials for CN and MoP/CN-15 are about A1.07 eV and A1.05 eV, respectively.The VB potentials of that are calculated to be 1.58 and 1.45 eV on the basis of its band gaps, respectively.It is easily concluded that the band alignments of the MoP modified CN catalysts meet the requirement for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 and H 2 production.Moreover, it is noteworthy that the slope of MoP/CN-15 is smaller than CN, revealing the increased carrier densities according to the Mott-Schottky equation given as follows 56: where e 0; e; e 0 and N d are the electron charge, the dielectric constant of CN, the permittivity of vacuum and the electron donor density, respectively.With an e value of 3.2 for CN 57, the electrons donor densities of CN and MoP/CN-15 are calculated to be 4:87 A 10 19 cm A3 and 1:32 A 10 20 cm A3 , respectively. In summary, MoP nanoparticles were used as a novel cocatalyst to establish MoP/CN composites for photoreduction CO 2 and photosplitting water.The obtained MoP/CN-15 composite had the highest activity in both CO 2 photoreduction and H 2 production.A maximum CO and H 2 yields of 0.92 lmol h A1 and 40.38 lmol h A1 had been obtained on it, which were 5.5 and 75.5 times as high as pure CN.The corresponding AQE values for CO 2 reduction and H 2 production were 3.5 and 18.3 at 420 nm, respectively, considerably 70 of the hydrogen production rate over 0.5 wt Pt/CN (57.66 lmol h A1 ) under the same experimental conditions.The significant improvement of photocatalytic activity may be explained as follows: (i) the introduction of MoP could effectively separate the photoexcited charges from CN and facilitate the transfer of photogenerated electrons, which is also proven by the DFT calculation results; (ii) the doped MoP could enhance the visible-light absorption capacity; (iii) the introduction MoP nanoparticles increases the activated specific surface area.This study paves a new way to design cost-effective CN based photocatalysts.
