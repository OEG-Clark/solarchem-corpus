To inspect the surface morphology and texture of Co 0.85 Se sample, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were conducted.The typical low-magnification FESEM image of the sample (Fig. 2a) clearly shows the 2D graphene-like morphology of the Co 0.85 Se nanosheets.TEM image (Fig. 2b) shows its near-transparency feature, indicating its ultrathin thickness.High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (Fig. 2c) reveals that the lattice fringes with d-spacing of 2.69 A are assigned to (101) plane of the hexagonal Co 0.85 Se.Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Fig. 2d) shows the polycrystalline nature of Co 0.85 Se nanosheets.Atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig. 3) clearly shows a smooth sheet with an average thickness of 0.72 nm, suggesting the ultrathin structure of Co 0.85 Se nanosheets. The activity is expected to be sensitive to the valence state and coordination environment of the metal center.The detailed information of the oxidation state of Co ions was investigated by XPS characterization.The high-resolution XPS of Co 2p (Fig. 4) reveals the electronbinding energies of Co 2p3/2 at 780.4 eV and Co 2p1/2 at 796.3 eV, indicating the main oxidation state of Co(II) in Co 0.85 Se sample 30,31.Meanwhile, an obvious satellite at the higher energy side of the Co 2p signal indicates the antibonding orbital between the Co atom and Se atom 32.The 3d bands arising from the metal atoms further split into , which makes Co 0.85 Se a metal-like conductor 25.The metal-like property of Co 0.85 Se permits efficient transport of charge from the photosensitizer to the reactants, which is desired for high performance of photocatalytic reactions. N 2 adsorption-desorption measurements were carried out to study the BET surface area and pore structure of the Co 0.85 Se sample.As shown in Fig. 5a, the N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms can be categorized as type IV with a type H3 hysteresis loop, reflecting its mesoporous characteristics, which could be attributed to the aggregation of Co 0.85 Se nanosheets.The BET surface area is measured to be ca.16.4 m 2 g -1 .To further demonstrate the opportunity of Co 0.85 Se nanosheets sample for CO 2 photoreduction, CO 2 adsorption measurement was conducted.As shown in Fig. 5b, the ultrathin Co 0.85 Se nanosheets samples show a maximum CO 2 uptake of 31.3 mg g -1 , which endows a priority for heterogeneous CO 2 reduction reactions. The cocatalytic property of the prepared Co 0.85 Se sample was evaluated in the CO 2 -saturated solution using Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 6H 2 O (abbreviated as Rub) as photosensitizer under visible-light irradiation.CO and H 2 were the two main reduction products.No detectable formic acid, methanol or CeC coupling products were formed in the liquid phase.As shown in Fig. 6a, Rub alone without any cocatalyst in the reaction shows poor generation rate of CO and H 2 .With 0.1 mg Co 0.85 Se added, the produced CO and H 2 are significantly enhanced to 24.6 and 6.6 mol in 1 h reaction, respectively, indicating that Co 0.85 Se remarkably promoted the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, as a heterogeneous cocatalyst.The cocatalytic effect of Co 0.85 Se could be attributed to the activation of CO 2 molecules and the fast transfer of photoelectrons on the surface of Co 0.85 Se nanosheets.This was further confirmed by in-situ photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy (Fig. S1) that the PL intensity obtained from Rub is diminished obviously after introducing Co 0.85 Se samples in the system, demonstrating the more efficient inhibition of charge carriers recombination. Fig. 6b shows the evolution of the produced CO and H 2 with irradiation time.In the initial 1 h, the amount of CO increased dramatically with the prolonging of the irradiation time with a high CO generation rate of 24.6 mol/h.After running the reaction up to 2 h, the generation rate of the product diminished gradually.It may be attributed to the exhaustion of the dye after long time operations under the reaction conditions 33,34.In order to confirm this hypothesis, fresh dye was further added into the reaction system after 2 h irradiation, and the reaction proceeded again as expected (Fig. S2).To test the stability of Co 0.85 Se cocatalyst, the consecutive photocatalytic reactions were performed.As shown in Fig. 6c, the CO evolution rate shows no obvious deactivation after six cycles runs of the activity experiments, revealing the good stability of Co 0.85 Se in such a mild system.In order to investigate its structural stability, the structure of the used cocatalysts was analyzed by XRD.The results (Fig. S3) show that the characteristic diffraction peaks of the used Co 0.85 Se sample has negligible changes compared with the fresh one, indicating its good structural stability. The effect of the introduced Co 0.85 Se amount in the reaction system was also investigated.As shown in Fig. S4, even adding trace amount (0.05 mg) of Co 0.85 Se, CO and H 2 production were achieved up to 23.3 and 4.9 mol, respectively, for 1 h reaction.When 0.1 mg Co 0.85 Se was added, the yield of CO reached a maximum value of 26.7 mol accompany with H 2 evolution of 14.6 mol, giving a high catalytic turnover number (TON, based on Co 0.85 Se) of 58.Further increasing the amount of Co 0.85 Se, H 2 production continued to increase, but the CO generation rate reduced obviously, which thus disclosed the different formation pathways for CO and H 2 .Based on the above results, it could be concluded that the rate determining step of the reaction was the mass transfer (the adsorption and diffusion) of the reactants to the catalytic centers when the cocatalyst was less than 0.1 mg, while it turned into the electron-transfer kinetics once the co-catalyst was more than 0.1 mg 33,35.Note that the total generation of CO and H 2 stays nearly unaltered when an excessive amount of Co 0.85 Se added, further confirming electron transfer from the sensitizer as the rate determining step.All these results highlight the dual functions of Co 0.85 Se in promoting CO 2 reduction acting as a CO 2 absorber and a redox promoter. The photocatalytic performance of such a hybrid system was evaluated under irradiation with different incident wavelength.As presented in Fig. 6d, the activity change trend is nearly in line with the light-absorbed spectrum of Rub photosensitizer, rather than that of Co 0.85 Se samples.This result suggests that CO 2 photoreduction reaction is indeed motivated by the photoexcitation of photosensitizer, generating excited electrons to implement the redox reactions, wherein Co 0.85 Se cocatalyst effectively mediates the electron transport to reduce the absorbed CO 2 molecules to CO. To highlight the superior function of the ultrathin Co 0.85 Se nanosheets in promoting CO 2 conversion catalysis, we further synthesized the bulk Co 0.85 Se samples (SEM see Fig. S5), and the catalytic performance for CO 2 photoreduction reaction was evaluated.As shown in Fig. 6a, the CO 2 reduction efficiency of ultrathin Co 0.85 Se nanosheets is almost 2.5 times higher than that of bulk Co 0.85 Se samples, indicating the superiority of ultrathin 2D structure in the CO 2 photoreduction. A series of control experiments were performed to demonstrate the essential of all components for CO 2 photoreduction reaction.As shown in Fig. 6a, neither CO nor H 2 was produced when the electron donor TEOA, photosensitizeror Rub or visible light irradiation was absent in the reaction system.The results indicate that the CO 2 reduction reaction is initiated by visible light excitation of the photosensitizer and the excited Rub is quenched by electron donor TEOA, and the lifetime of the excited electrons is thus prolonged.When the catalytic system was evaluated in N 2 atmosphere under otherwise identical conditions, no any CO was detected.The result indicates that the formed CO is originated from CO 2 rather than the carbon-containing organics in the reaction system.This conclusion was also supported by the 13 C-labelled isotropic experiment.As shown in Fig. 7, the peak at 3.5 min with the m/z value of 29 in GC-MS results was assigned to 13 CO, indicating that the generated CO was derived from the reactant CO 2 .In short, Co 0.85 Se indeed promote the reduction of CO 2 into CO."}, {"llm generation": "Visible light", "source": "For the first time, the as-prepared Co 0.85 Se was applied to be an efficient heterogeneous cocatalyst for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction under visible light irradiation.", "context": "Ultrathin 2D Co 0.85 Se nanosheets have been successfully designed and synthesized via a simple solvothermal method.For the first time, the as-prepared Co 0.85 Se was applied to be an efficient heterogeneous cocatalyst for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction under visible light irradiation.Under the optimal reaction conditions, the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction system achieved a superior catalytic performance with a CO generation rate of 24.6 mol/h.Compared with the bulk Co 0.85 Se sample, the ultrathin 2D structure show much better activity towards CO 2 photoreduction by promoting the separation and transfer of photogenerated charge carriers, delivering large surface area for CO 2 adsorption, and exposing rich active sites for surface catalysis.The current work may inspire the development of transition metal compounds with ultrathin 2D nanosheet structure for artificial photosynthesis.

To inspect the surface morphology and texture of Co 0.85 Se sample, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were conducted.The typical low-magnification FESEM image of the sample (Fig. 2a) clearly shows the 2D graphene-like morphology of the Co 0.85 Se nanosheets.TEM image (Fig. 2b) shows its near-transparency feature, indicating its ultrathin thickness.High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (Fig. 2c) reveals that the lattice fringes with d-spacing of 2.69 A are assigned to (101) plane of the hexagonal Co 0.85 Se.Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Fig. 2d) shows the polycrystalline nature of Co 0.85 Se nanosheets.Atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig. 3) clearly shows a smooth sheet with an average thickness of 0.72 nm, suggesting the ultrathin structure of Co 0.85 Se nanosheets. The activity is expected to be sensitive to the valence state and coordination environment of the metal center.The detailed information of the oxidation state of Co ions was investigated by XPS characterization.The high-resolution XPS of Co 2p (Fig. 4) reveals the electronbinding energies of Co 2p3/2 at 780.4 eV and Co 2p1/2 at 796.3 eV, indicating the main oxidation state of Co(II) in Co 0.85 Se sample 30,31.Meanwhile, an obvious satellite at the higher energy side of the Co 2p signal indicates the antibonding orbital between the Co atom and Se atom 32.The 3d bands arising from the metal atoms further split into , which makes Co 0.85 Se a metal-like conductor 25.The metal-like property of Co 0.85 Se permits efficient transport of charge from the photosensitizer to the reactants, which is desired for high performance of photocatalytic reactions. N 2 adsorption-desorption measurements were carried out to study the BET surface area and pore structure of the Co 0.85 Se sample.As shown in Fig. 5a, the N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms can be categorized as type IV with a type H3 hysteresis loop, reflecting its mesoporous characteristics, which could be attributed to the aggregation of Co 0.85 Se nanosheets.The BET surface area is measured to be ca.16.4 m 2 g -1 .To further demonstrate the opportunity of Co 0.85 Se nanosheets sample for CO 2 photoreduction, CO 2 adsorption measurement was conducted.As shown in Fig. 5b, the ultrathin Co 0.85 Se nanosheets samples show a maximum CO 2 uptake of 31.3 mg g -1 , which endows a priority for heterogeneous CO 2 reduction reactions. The cocatalytic property of the prepared Co 0.85 Se sample was evaluated in the CO 2 -saturated solution using Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 6H 2 O (abbreviated as Rub) as photosensitizer under visible-light irradiation.CO and H 2 were the two main reduction products.No detectable formic acid, methanol or CeC coupling products were formed in the liquid phase.As shown in Fig. 6a, Rub alone without any cocatalyst in the reaction shows poor generation rate of CO and H 2 .With 0.1 mg Co 0.85 Se added, the produced CO and H 2 are significantly enhanced to 24.6 and 6.6 mol in 1 h reaction, respectively, indicating that Co 0.85 Se remarkably promoted the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, as a heterogeneous cocatalyst.The cocatalytic effect of Co 0.85 Se could be attributed to the activation of CO 2 molecules and the fast transfer of photoelectrons on the surface of Co 0.85 Se nanosheets.This was further confirmed by in-situ photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy (Fig. S1) that the PL intensity obtained from Rub is diminished obviously after introducing Co 0.85 Se samples in the system, demonstrating the more efficient inhibition of charge carriers recombination. Fig. 6b shows the evolution of the produced CO and H 2 with irradiation time.In the initial 1 h, the amount of CO increased dramatically with the prolonging of the irradiation time with a high CO generation rate of 24.6 mol/h.After running the reaction up to 2 h, the generation rate of the product diminished gradually.It may be attributed to the exhaustion of the dye after long time operations under the reaction conditions 33,34.In order to confirm this hypothesis, fresh dye was further added into the reaction system after 2 h irradiation, and the reaction proceeded again as expected (Fig. S2).To test the stability of Co 0.85 Se cocatalyst, the consecutive photocatalytic reactions were performed.As shown in Fig. 6c, the CO evolution rate shows no obvious deactivation after six cycles runs of the activity experiments, revealing the good stability of Co 0.85 Se in such a mild system.In order to investigate its structural stability, the structure of the used cocatalysts was analyzed by XRD.The results (Fig. S3) show that the characteristic diffraction peaks of the used Co 0.85 Se sample has negligible changes compared with the fresh one, indicating its good structural stability. The effect of the introduced Co 0.85 Se amount in the reaction system was also investigated.As shown in Fig. S4, even adding trace amount (0.05 mg) of Co 0.85 Se, CO and H 2 production were achieved up to 23.3 and 4.9 mol, respectively, for 1 h reaction.When 0.1 mg Co 0.85 Se was added, the yield of CO reached a maximum value of 26.7 mol accompany with H 2 evolution of 14.6 mol, giving a high catalytic turnover number (TON, based on Co 0.85 Se) of 58.Further increasing the amount of Co 0.85 Se, H 2 production continued to increase, but the CO generation rate reduced obviously, which thus disclosed the different formation pathways for CO and H 2 .Based on the above results, it could be concluded that the rate determining step of the reaction was the mass transfer (the adsorption and diffusion) of the reactants to the catalytic centers when the cocatalyst was less than 0.1 mg, while it turned into the electron-transfer kinetics once the co-catalyst was more than 0.1 mg 33,35.Note that the total generation of CO and H 2 stays nearly unaltered when an excessive amount of Co 0.85 Se added, further confirming electron transfer from the sensitizer as the rate determining step.All these results highlight the dual functions of Co 0.85 Se in promoting CO 2 reduction acting as a CO 2 absorber and a redox promoter. The photocatalytic performance of such a hybrid system was evaluated under irradiation with different incident wavelength.As presented in Fig. 6d, the activity change trend is nearly in line with the light-absorbed spectrum of Rub photosensitizer, rather than that of Co 0.85 Se samples.This result suggests that CO 2 photoreduction reaction is indeed motivated by the photoexcitation of photosensitizer, generating excited electrons to implement the redox reactions, wherein Co 0.85 Se cocatalyst effectively mediates the electron transport to reduce the absorbed CO 2 molecules to CO. To highlight the superior function of the ultrathin Co 0.85 Se nanosheets in promoting CO 2 conversion catalysis, we further synthesized the bulk Co 0.85 Se samples (SEM see Fig. S5), and the catalytic performance for CO 2 photoreduction reaction was evaluated.As shown in Fig. 6a, the CO 2 reduction efficiency of ultrathin Co 0.85 Se nanosheets is almost 2.5 times higher than that of bulk Co 0.85 Se samples, indicating the superiority of ultrathin 2D structure in the CO 2 photoreduction. A series of control experiments were performed to demonstrate the essential of all components for CO 2 photoreduction reaction.As shown in Fig. 6a, neither CO nor H 2 was produced when the electron donor TEOA, photosensitizeror Rub or visible light irradiation was absent in the reaction system.The results indicate that the CO 2 reduction reaction is initiated by visible light excitation of the photosensitizer and the excited Rub is quenched by electron donor TEOA, and the lifetime of the excited electrons is thus prolonged.When the catalytic system was evaluated in N 2 atmosphere under otherwise identical conditions, no any CO was detected.The result indicates that the formed CO is originated from CO 2 rather than the carbon-containing organics in the reaction system.This conclusion was also supported by the 13 C-labelled isotropic experiment.As shown in Fig. 7, the peak at 3.5 min with the m/z value of 29 in GC-MS results was assigned to 13 CO, indicating that the generated CO was derived from the reactant CO 2 .In short, Co 0.85 Se indeed promote the reduction of CO 2 into CO."}], "reactor type": [{"llm generation": "Slurry", "source": "8 mg Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 6H 2 O and a certain amount of Co 0.85 Se were added to a solution of triethanolamine (TEOA)/water/acetonitrile (1 mL/2 mL/3 mL) in the 100 mL Schlenk flask reactor.", "context": "Co 0.85 Se ultrathin nanosheets were fabricated by a simple solvothermal method.In a typical procedure, 1 mmol of Co(AC) 2 and 1 mmol of Na 2 SeO 3 were added into a solvent composed of 40 mL of DETA (diethylenetriamine) and 20 mL of deionized water with stirring, respectively.After further stirring for 30 min. in a beaker to dissolve completely, the homogeneous solution was transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave, which was sealed and maintained at 180 C for 12 h and then cooled to room temperature naturally.The resulting solid product was collected and washed with deionized water and absolute ethanol repeatedly.Then, the black product was obtained after freezedrying for further characterizations.The bulk Co 0.85 Se sample was synthesized by the same method without DETA.
