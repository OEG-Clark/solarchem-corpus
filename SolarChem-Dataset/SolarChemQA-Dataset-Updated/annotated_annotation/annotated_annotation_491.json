To further study the hierarchical structure of NS-CN, its N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms were obtained and are shown in Fig. 3.Both bulk-CN and NS-CN possess type IV nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms according to the BDDT (Brunauer-Deming-Demin-Teller) classication, indicating that the multilayer adsorption and capillary condensation/ evaporation take place during nitrogen adsorption-desorption processes. 26,27Besides, the shape of both hysteresis loops is H3 type according to the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) classication, revealing that these layered materials have slit-shaped pores due to aggregation of ake-like particles. 2627728 Importantly, NS-CN shows much higher N 2 adsorption capacity than the bulk-CN in the full range of relative pressures (P/P 0 ).This is because of the existence of larger amount of mesopores in the NS-CN sample.The pore size distribution (PSD) curves (inset in Fig. 3) show that despite the presence of macropores in both samples, a much more intense peak appeared in the PSD curve at the pore sizes of about 3 nm for NS-CN as compared to that for the bulk-CN.The specic surface area, total pore volume and average pore size of NS-CN are 116 m 2 g A1 , 0.35 cm 3 g A1 , and 14.5 nm, respectively, which all are greatly improved as compared to those of bulk-CN (15 m 2 g A1 , 0.11 cm 3 g A1 , and 23.6 nm, respectively).These results conrm the formation of hierarchical structures during the assembly of ultrathin nanosheets, which consequently increases the specic surface area and facilitates mass diffusion and transfer due to the presence of interconnected porous networks, as well as improves light harvesting through lightscattering effects. 9,29T-IR spectra (Fig. 4) were measured to investigate the surface properties of the bulk-CN and NS-CN samples.Both spectra display a sharp peak at 810 cm A1 that corresponds to the characteristic breathing mode of tri-s-triazine heterocycles, revealing that the tri-s-triazine-based structure was not broken during the NH 3 -mediated thermal exfoliation process. 30The peaks in the region of 1200-1700 cm A1 originate from different vibration modes of the C-N bond within the tri-s-triazine rings. 11,31Moreover, the broad absorption band from 3000 to 3400 cm A1 can be ascribed to various vibration modes of the N-H bond, 31,32 implying the existence of amino groups on the surface of both g-C 3 N 4 samples.Note that the transmissivity of this N-H related band in the IR spectrum (inset) of bulk-CN and NS-CN is 55 and 43, respectively, indicating that more amino groups are introduced onto the surface of g-C 3 N 4 during the NH 3 -mediated thermal treatment.The amino groups are expected to enhance the CO 2 adsorption ability through base-acid interactions. 13,14,33he chemical states of surface elements were analyzed by XPS.The full survey spectra in Fig. 5a indicate the existence of C, N and O elements in both bulk-CN and NS-CN samples.The high-resolution spectra of C 1s shown in Fig. 5b can be tted into two peaks at 284.8 and 287.8 eV.The former corresponds to sp 2 C-C bonding from surface adventitious carbon 34,35 and the latter is attributed to the characteristic NC-N 2 bonding in the molecular structure of g-C 3 N 4 . 36Fig. 5c shows the high-resolution N 1s spectra.The peaks at binding energies of 398.2 and 399.7 eV are assigned to sp 2 -hybridized nitrogen atoms (CN-C) and bridging nitrogen atoms ((C) 3 -N), respectively. 37The peak centered at 401.2 eV is indicative of N-H bonding, and the weak peak at 404.1 eV is due to the charging effects caused by p excitations. 38Additionally, a single peak is also observed at 532.3 eV (Fig. 5d), which is ascribed to adsorbed H 2 O or CO 2 on the surface. 39It is noteworthy that all the peaks in the highresolution spectra of C and N elements show no shi, suggesting that the main molecular structure of g-C 3 N 4 on the basis of tri-s-triazine was not affected during the NH 3 -mediated thermal exfoliation process.However, the estimated molar ratios of C/N in the bulk-CN and NS-CN according to the XPS analysis are 0.73 and 0.65, respectively.The signal intensity of the tted peaks (inset, Fig. 5c) of amino nitrogen atoms in the NS-CN sample is higher than that of bulk-CN, implying that the NS-CN sample possesses more marginal amino groups than bulk-CN.Furthermore, the elemental analysis conrms that the content of the hydrogen element on the surface of NS-CN and bulk-CN is 1.177 and 0.861, respectively.Besides, the content of nitrogen in NS-CN and bulk-CN is 63.74 and 63.51, respectively, based on the elemental analysis.An increase in the H and N contents in NS-CN can be attributed to the introduction of amino groups as discussed above. Zeta potentials measured for the bulk-CN and NS-CN samples in aqueous solution at different pH values reveal the variation of surface charges, as shown in Fig. 6.Normally, there are primary (CNH 2 ), secondary (C 2 NH) and tertiary (C 3 N) amino groups in the structure of g-C 3 N 4 .The CNH 2 and C 2 NH amino groups exist in the marginal part of the g-C 3 N 4 framework due to an incomplete condensation of melem, while the C 3 N amino groups exist in the conjugated plane composed of tri-s-triazine heterocyclic rings.Particularly, the CNH 2 and C 2 NH groups can accept either hydroxyl ions or protons in the aqueous solution at different pH values.However, the C 3 N groups are regarded as only proton acceptors because of the existence of lone pair electrons in sp 2 hybridised N atoms. 34,35The isoelectric points (IEPs) of the bulk-CN and NS-CN samples were measured to be 4.82 and 5.76, respectively.Since the number of the exposed internal C 3 N groups aer exfoliation of the bulk-CN into ultrathin nanosheets is higher, the proton adsorption capacity of NS-CN is higher as evidenced by its larger IEP value.These more exposed C 3 N groups with lone pair electrons of N are actually Lewis base sites and can serve as adsorption sites for CO 2 molecules. 40 higher affinity of a photocatalyst toward CO 2 is benecial for surface catalytic reactions. 19,41Once CO 2 molecules are trapped by active sites on the surface of a photocatalyst, they can be reduced by photoelectrons and converted into fuels such as CH 4 , CH 3 OH and so on. 17,42As such, CO 2 adsorption curves were measured and are shown in Fig. 7.As can be seen from this gure the NS-CN sample shows a remarkably enlarged CO 2 adsorption, which is more than 4 times higher than that measured for the bulk-CN.The much higher CO 2 adsorption capacity of NS-CN in the pressure range studied can be mainly attributed to the improved physical adsorption that originates from the high specic area and well developed porosity as well as chemical adsorption of CO 2 molecules on amine groups.In addition, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were employed to evaluate the adsorption energy (E a ) of CO 2 molecules on the photocatalysts studied.As dened here, a more negative E a value suggests stronger adsorption of CO 2 on the surface of a photocatalyst. 43The optimized congurations of CO 2 adsorbed on the surface of the bulk-CN and NS-CN are shown in Fig. 8. Particularly, the calculated adsorption energy (E a ) of the bulk-CN and NS-CN is A0.99 and A1.37 eV, respectively.The results indicate that the NS-CN sample shows a higher adsorption affinity toward CO 2 under identical conditions, which is benecial for photocatalytic CO 2 conversion. Fig. 9a shows the UV-Vis absorption spectra of the bulk-CN and NS-CN.The absorption edge of the bulk-CN is 455 nm, which corresponds to the band gap of 2.72 eV according to the Kubelka-Munk function (inset of Fig. 9a).However, an obvious blue shi of the absorption edge visible in the spectrum of NS-CN gives rise to an enlarged band gap of 2.98 eV.This is due to the quantum size effect of the ultrathin structure of NS-CN. 44An enhanced light absorption in the wide range of 450-800 nm is also observed for NS-CN, caused by the light-scattering effects of the hierarchical structures, which can promote surface photocatalytic reactions.The Mott-Schottky plots (Fig. 9b andc) and XPS valence band (VB) spectra (Fig. 9d) are further measured to elucidate the CB and VB positions of the bulk-CN and NS-CN.Both samples are n-type semiconductors based on the Mott-Schottky plots.The at-band potentials are A1.16 and A1.25 V (vs.NHE, pH 14 7) for the bulk-CN and NS-CN, respectively, while their VB values from XPS are determined to be 1.58 and 1.76 V, respectively.Therefore the band structures can be well resolved as illustrated in Fig. 9e.It is noteworthy that NS-CN possesses a more negative CB and more positive VB as compared to those of bulk-CN, indicating a stronger reduction and oxidation ability for photogenerated charge carriers. 9,45he electronic structures of the bulk-CN and NS-CN were also investigated by DFT calculations.The density of states (DOS) (Fig. 10) shows that their CBs are comprised of N 2p and C 2p orbitals, while their VBs mainly consist of N 2s and N 2p orbitals.The calculated band gap values of the bulk-CN and NS-CN are 1.07 and 1.18 eV, respectively, which are smaller than the above-discussed experimental values due to the limitation of DFT calculations. 16,46However, this result is still indicative and reveals that NS-CN has a relatively wide band gap as compared to that of the bulk-CN material, which is consistent with the experimental results. Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction experiments were carried out to evaluate the photocatalytic properties of the as-prepared samples.As shown in Fig. 11a, successful CO 2 conversion into CH 4 and CH 3 OH occurred in the presence of g-C 3 N 4 photocatalysts.Obviously, the generation rates of both CH 4 and CH 3 OH for NS-CN are greatly enhanced, which are 10 and 5 times higher than the corresponding values obtained for the bulk-CN, respectively. The in situ FTIR spectra of NS-CN were analyzed to understand the conversion process of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.As shown in Fig. 11b andc, the peaks at 1512, 1438, 1631, 1265 and 1048 cm A1 belong to the carbonate species. 47,48The peaks at 1286, 1326, 1386, 1532, 1558, 1641 and 1695 cm A1 are ascribed to formate. 4950051 The peaks at 1419, 1458, 1607 and 1657 cm A1 refer to formaldehyde. 48Besides, the peaks at 1732 and 1103 cm A1 are attributed to the vibration of methoxyl groups, which originate from methanol. 47The remaining peaks at 1716 and 1756 cm A1 are assigned to the carboxylate and carbonyl groups, respectively. 48,50CH 4 was not detected due to its nonpolar nature and low affinity toward the g-C 3 N 4 surface.It is clear that prior to irradiation, primary carbonate species were rst detected on the surface of the photocatalyst in the presence of CO 2 and water vapor in the reaction system.Aer the irradiation of monochromatic light (365 nm), formate, formaldehyde and methanol appeared and their amount gradually increased accompanied by a simultaneous decrease of carbonate species, although CH 4 molecules could not be detected due to their nonpolar nature and low affinity toward the g-C 3 N 4 surface.The results indicate that the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 into hydrocarbon fuels on the g-C 3 N 4 surface undergoes a multi-step process involving intermediate products such as formic acid and formaldehyde, and nally they are converted into CH 4 and CH 3 OH. According to the above-discussed results, a possible mechanism of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was proposed as illustrated in Fig. 12.Under the irradiation of UV-visible light, the g-C 3 N 4 sample is excited and generates holes and electrons. Those holes can be utilized to produce plenty of H with water.Meanwhile, the photo-generated electrons are involved in a series of photocatalytic reactions with a multi-electron process. 4,17,5253354 Briey, the adsorbed CO 2 on the surface is rstly reduced into HCOOH species with 2e A and 2H .Then these intermediate products are subsequently reduced into HCHO, CH 3 OH and CH 4 species step by step. 5556657 Besides, the 2e A from g-C 3 N 4 and 2H from the surrounding environment are required for each step of the reaction.Finally, the CO 2 molecules can be converted into CH 4 and CH 3 OH chemical fuels under the irradiation of light. The charge transfer dynamics taking place on the bulk-CN and NS-CN were analysed by transient photocurrent responses, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and timeresolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectroscopy.As shown in Fig. 13a, the photocurrent intensity of NS-CN is notably higher than that of the bulk-CN with several on-off cycles of light irradiation, indicating more efficient electron-hole pair transfer and separation on the NS-CN photocatalyst.Note that the current intensity of NS-CN shows a gradual increase as the light is turned on, and gradual decrease as the light is turned off.Such a phenomenon is caused by the relaxation effect during excitation and de-excitation processes. 39,58For NS-CN, the number of surface delocalized p bonds is higher than that for the bulk-CN due to the larger number of exposed aromatic heterocycles aer exfoliation.A large portion of photogenerated electrons in the conduction band of NS-CN can be gradually accumulated because of these delocalized p bonds.Therefore, the photocurrent gradually increased due to the photogenerated electrons stored in these delocalized p bonds.On the other hand, when the light is turned off, the stored electrons are gradually released from the surface delocalized p bonds and then transferred to the working electrode, leading to a gradual decrease of the photocurrent to zero.Hence, the enrichment of photogenerated electrons in the delocalized p bonds can reduce the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes, and consequently facilitate the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 molecules and formation of CH 4 and CH 3 OH, which are eightelectron and six-electron processes of CO 2 photoreduction, respectively. EIS Nyquist plots obtained for the bulk-CN and NS-CN are shown in Fig. 13b.In the analog equivalent circuit (inset of Fig. 13b), R ctr represents the charge-transfer resistance of the working electrode, R sr represents the solution resistance (Na 2 SO 4 ), and CPE represents the constant phase element between the electrolyte solution and electrode.The size of the semicircular arc in the Nyquist plots here reects R ctr , 59 which is estimated as 2.2 and 6.4 kU for NS-CN and bulk-CN, respectively.Namely, a smaller semicircle radius implies lower charge-transfer resistance and thus a faster charge-transfer rate in NS-CN due to its ultrathin structure. The TRPL spectra were further recorded to investigate the lifetime of photogenerated charge carriers as shown in Fig. 13c.The curves of both bulk-CN and NS-CN can be well tted through a bi-exponential function. 6061162 The short lifetime, long lifetime, and average lifetime are 2.8, 9.5, and 6.7 ns for NS-CN, and 1.5, 6.3, and 3.4 ns for the bulk-CN, respectively.The results indicate that the lifetimes of photogenerated charge carriers in NS-CN have been remarkably prolonged as compared to those obtained for the bulk-CN, which is due to the strong electron capture ability of the surface states in NS-CN.This result combined with the transient photocurrent response and EIS analysis indicates that a signicantly enhanced transfer and separation efficiency can be achieved over the NS-CN photocatalyst, which is one of the crucial factors to facilitate the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction."}, {"llm generation": "bulk-CN and NS-CN", "source": "The charge transfer dynamics taking place on the bulk-CN and NS-CN were analysed by transient photocurrent responses, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and timeresolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectroscopy.", "context": "The XRD patterns of dicyandiamide-derived g-C 3 N 4 (bulk-CN) and g-C 3 N 4 ultra-thin nanosheets (NS-CN) are shown in Fig. 1.The XRD pattern of the bulk-CN exhibits the typical (100) and (002) diffraction peaks at 13.2 and 27.3 , respectively.The former corresponds to the repeated structural packing of tri-striazine heterocycles in the conjugated planes, and the latter can be ascribed to the regular graphite-like interlayer stacking. 20,21Consistently, the pattern of NS-CN shows the (100) and (002) peaks at the same positions, indicating the preservation of the molecular structure of graphitic carbon nitride.However, its peak intensities are much weaker than those of the bulk-CN and moreover, a broad peak in the range of 20-30 corresponding to the amorphous phase appears.These results reveal a decrease in the crystallinity of graphitic carbon nitride aer NH 3 -mediated thermal exfoliation, which leads to the formation of longrange ordered ultra-thin nanosheets and short-range ordered graphitic molecular fragments (related to the amorphous peak). 22,23he morphology of NS-CN was investigated by FESEM imaging.Interestingly, hierarchical structures assembled by ultra-thin nanosheets are visible in the FESEM images (Fig. 2a andb), while the bulk-CN is composed of aggregated particles (Fig. 2c).A nanosheet-type structure of NS-CN was further probed by TEM and AFM analysis.As shown in Fig. 2d, the nanosheet domains are thin and nearly transparent, indicating their ultra-thin thickness.The AFM image in Fig. 2e conrms that the thickness of these nanosheets is 3 nm, corresponding to 9-10 layers of conjugated planes of graphitic carbon nitride.The results demonstrate that the NH 3 -mediated thermal treatment of the bulk g-C 3 N 4 led to its efficient exfoliation into ultrathin nanosheets.The formation of ultrathin nanosheets is illustrated in Fig. 2f.As a small and polar molecule, NH 3 can intercalate into the interplanar space of the bulk g-C 3 N 4 during the heating process, and consequently break the weak van der Waals bonds between the graphitic layers of carbon nitride.Then efficient exfoliation of the bulk g-C 3 N 4 into ultrathin nanosheets could be achieved by the thermal shock of NH 3 gas.Such an ultrathin structure can not only increase the specic surface area and the amount of surface active sites, but also shorten the diffusion distance of charge carriers from the interior to the surface of g-C 3 N 4 , resulting in higher charge separation efficiency and smaller recombination of photogenerated charge carriers.Moreover, ultrathin g-C 3 N 4 has a larger band gap, which implies the formation of photogenerated charge carriers with stronger redox ability. 24,25All these features of ultrathin g-C 3 N 4 will enhance its photocatalytic activity toward CO 2 reduction. To further study the hierarchical structure of NS-CN, its N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms were obtained and are shown in Fig. 3.Both bulk-CN and NS-CN possess type IV nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms according to the BDDT (Brunauer-Deming-Demin-Teller) classication, indicating that the multilayer adsorption and capillary condensation/ evaporation take place during nitrogen adsorption-desorption processes. 26,27Besides, the shape of both hysteresis loops is H3 type according to the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) classication, revealing that these layered materials have slit-shaped pores due to aggregation of ake-like particles. 2627728 Importantly, NS-CN shows much higher N 2 adsorption capacity than the bulk-CN in the full range of relative pressures (P/P 0 ).This is because of the existence of larger amount of mesopores in the NS-CN sample.The pore size distribution (PSD) curves (inset in Fig. 3) show that despite the presence of macropores in both samples, a much more intense peak appeared in the PSD curve at the pore sizes of about 3 nm for NS-CN as compared to that for the bulk-CN.The specic surface area, total pore volume and average pore size of NS-CN are 116 m 2 g A1 , 0.35 cm 3 g A1 , and 14.5 nm, respectively, which all are greatly improved as compared to those of bulk-CN (15 m 2 g A1 , 0.11 cm 3 g A1 , and 23.6 nm, respectively).These results conrm the formation of hierarchical structures during the assembly of ultrathin nanosheets, which consequently increases the specic surface area and facilitates mass diffusion and transfer due to the presence of interconnected porous networks, as well as improves light harvesting through lightscattering effects. 9,29T-IR spectra (Fig. 4) were measured to investigate the surface properties of the bulk-CN and NS-CN samples.Both spectra display a sharp peak at 810 cm A1 that corresponds to the characteristic breathing mode of tri-s-triazine heterocycles, revealing that the tri-s-triazine-based structure was not broken during the NH 3 -mediated thermal exfoliation process. 30The peaks in the region of 1200-1700 cm A1 originate from different vibration modes of the C-N bond within the tri-s-triazine rings. 11,31Moreover, the broad absorption band from 3000 to 3400 cm A1 can be ascribed to various vibration modes of the N-H bond, 31,32 implying the existence of amino groups on the surface of both g-C 3 N 4 samples.Note that the transmissivity of this N-H related band in the IR spectrum (inset) of bulk-CN and NS-CN is 55 and 43, respectively, indicating that more amino groups are introduced onto the surface of g-C 3 N 4 during the NH 3 -mediated thermal treatment.The amino groups are expected to enhance the CO 2 adsorption ability through base-acid interactions. 13,14,33he chemical states of surface elements were analyzed by XPS.The full survey spectra in Fig. 5a indicate the existence of C, N and O elements in both bulk-CN and NS-CN samples.The high-resolution spectra of C 1s shown in Fig. 5b can be tted into two peaks at 284.8 and 287.8 eV.The former corresponds to sp 2 C-C bonding from surface adventitious carbon 34,35 and the latter is attributed to the characteristic NC-N 2 bonding in the molecular structure of g-C 3 N 4 . 36Fig. 5c shows the high-resolution N 1s spectra.The peaks at binding energies of 398.2 and 399.7 eV are assigned to sp 2 -hybridized nitrogen atoms (CN-C) and bridging nitrogen atoms ((C) 3 -N), respectively. 37The peak centered at 401.2 eV is indicative of N-H bonding, and the weak peak at 404.1 eV is due to the charging effects caused by p excitations. 38Additionally, a single peak is also observed at 532.3 eV (Fig. 5d), which is ascribed to adsorbed H 2 O or CO 2 on the surface. 39It is noteworthy that all the peaks in the highresolution spectra of C and N elements show no shi, suggesting that the main molecular structure of g-C 3 N 4 on the basis of tri-s-triazine was not affected during the NH 3 -mediated thermal exfoliation process.However, the estimated molar ratios of C/N in the bulk-CN and NS-CN according to the XPS analysis are 0.73 and 0.65, respectively.The signal intensity of the tted peaks (inset, Fig. 5c) of amino nitrogen atoms in the NS-CN sample is higher than that of bulk-CN, implying that the NS-CN sample possesses more marginal amino groups than bulk-CN.Furthermore, the elemental analysis conrms that the content of the hydrogen element on the surface of NS-CN and bulk-CN is 1.177 and 0.861, respectively.Besides, the content of nitrogen in NS-CN and bulk-CN is 63.74 and 63.51, respectively, based on the elemental analysis.An increase in the H and N contents in NS-CN can be attributed to the introduction of amino groups as discussed above. Zeta potentials measured for the bulk-CN and NS-CN samples in aqueous solution at different pH values reveal the variation of surface charges, as shown in Fig. 6.Normally, there are primary (CNH 2 ), secondary (C 2 NH) and tertiary (C 3 N) amino groups in the structure of g-C 3 N 4 .The CNH 2 and C 2 NH amino groups exist in the marginal part of the g-C 3 N 4 framework due to an incomplete condensation of melem, while the C 3 N amino groups exist in the conjugated plane composed of tri-s-triazine heterocyclic rings.Particularly, the CNH 2 and C 2 NH groups can accept either hydroxyl ions or protons in the aqueous solution at different pH values.However, the C 3 N groups are regarded as only proton acceptors because of the existence of lone pair electrons in sp 2 hybridised N atoms. 34,35The isoelectric points (IEPs) of the bulk-CN and NS-CN samples were measured to be 4.82 and 5.76, respectively.Since the number of the exposed internal C 3 N groups aer exfoliation of the bulk-CN into ultrathin nanosheets is higher, the proton adsorption capacity of NS-CN is higher as evidenced by its larger IEP value.These more exposed C 3 N groups with lone pair electrons of N are actually Lewis base sites and can serve as adsorption sites for CO 2 molecules. 40 higher affinity of a photocatalyst toward CO 2 is benecial for surface catalytic reactions. 19,41Once CO 2 molecules are trapped by active sites on the surface of a photocatalyst, they can be reduced by photoelectrons and converted into fuels such as CH 4 , CH 3 OH and so on. 17,42As such, CO 2 adsorption curves were measured and are shown in Fig. 7.As can be seen from this gure the NS-CN sample shows a remarkably enlarged CO 2 adsorption, which is more than 4 times higher than that measured for the bulk-CN.The much higher CO 2 adsorption capacity of NS-CN in the pressure range studied can be mainly attributed to the improved physical adsorption that originates from the high specic area and well developed porosity as well as chemical adsorption of CO 2 molecules on amine groups.In addition, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were employed to evaluate the adsorption energy (E a ) of CO 2 molecules on the photocatalysts studied.As dened here, a more negative E a value suggests stronger adsorption of CO 2 on the surface of a photocatalyst. 43The optimized congurations of CO 2 adsorbed on the surface of the bulk-CN and NS-CN are shown in Fig. 8. Particularly, the calculated adsorption energy (E a ) of the bulk-CN and NS-CN is A0.99 and A1.37 eV, respectively.The results indicate that the NS-CN sample shows a higher adsorption affinity toward CO 2 under identical conditions, which is benecial for photocatalytic CO 2 conversion. Fig. 9a shows the UV-Vis absorption spectra of the bulk-CN and NS-CN.The absorption edge of the bulk-CN is 455 nm, which corresponds to the band gap of 2.72 eV according to the Kubelka-Munk function (inset of Fig. 9a).However, an obvious blue shi of the absorption edge visible in the spectrum of NS-CN gives rise to an enlarged band gap of 2.98 eV.This is due to the quantum size effect of the ultrathin structure of NS-CN. 44An enhanced light absorption in the wide range of 450-800 nm is also observed for NS-CN, caused by the light-scattering effects of the hierarchical structures, which can promote surface photocatalytic reactions.The Mott-Schottky plots (Fig. 9b andc) and XPS valence band (VB) spectra (Fig. 9d) are further measured to elucidate the CB and VB positions of the bulk-CN and NS-CN.Both samples are n-type semiconductors based on the Mott-Schottky plots.The at-band potentials are A1.16 and A1.25 V (vs.NHE, pH 14 7) for the bulk-CN and NS-CN, respectively, while their VB values from XPS are determined to be 1.58 and 1.76 V, respectively.Therefore the band structures can be well resolved as illustrated in Fig. 9e.It is noteworthy that NS-CN possesses a more negative CB and more positive VB as compared to those of bulk-CN, indicating a stronger reduction and oxidation ability for photogenerated charge carriers. 9,45he electronic structures of the bulk-CN and NS-CN were also investigated by DFT calculations.The density of states (DOS) (Fig. 10) shows that their CBs are comprised of N 2p and C 2p orbitals, while their VBs mainly consist of N 2s and N 2p orbitals.The calculated band gap values of the bulk-CN and NS-CN are 1.07 and 1.18 eV, respectively, which are smaller than the above-discussed experimental values due to the limitation of DFT calculations. 16,46However, this result is still indicative and reveals that NS-CN has a relatively wide band gap as compared to that of the bulk-CN material, which is consistent with the experimental results. Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction experiments were carried out to evaluate the photocatalytic properties of the as-prepared samples.As shown in Fig. 11a, successful CO 2 conversion into CH 4 and CH 3 OH occurred in the presence of g-C 3 N 4 photocatalysts.Obviously, the generation rates of both CH 4 and CH 3 OH for NS-CN are greatly enhanced, which are 10 and 5 times higher than the corresponding values obtained for the bulk-CN, respectively. The in situ FTIR spectra of NS-CN were analyzed to understand the conversion process of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.As shown in Fig. 11b andc, the peaks at 1512, 1438, 1631, 1265 and 1048 cm A1 belong to the carbonate species. 47,48The peaks at 1286, 1326, 1386, 1532, 1558, 1641 and 1695 cm A1 are ascribed to formate. 4950051 The peaks at 1419, 1458, 1607 and 1657 cm A1 refer to formaldehyde. 48Besides, the peaks at 1732 and 1103 cm A1 are attributed to the vibration of methoxyl groups, which originate from methanol. 47The remaining peaks at 1716 and 1756 cm A1 are assigned to the carboxylate and carbonyl groups, respectively. 48,50CH 4 was not detected due to its nonpolar nature and low affinity toward the g-C 3 N 4 surface.It is clear that prior to irradiation, primary carbonate species were rst detected on the surface of the photocatalyst in the presence of CO 2 and water vapor in the reaction system.Aer the irradiation of monochromatic light (365 nm), formate, formaldehyde and methanol appeared and their amount gradually increased accompanied by a simultaneous decrease of carbonate species, although CH 4 molecules could not be detected due to their nonpolar nature and low affinity toward the g-C 3 N 4 surface.The results indicate that the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 into hydrocarbon fuels on the g-C 3 N 4 surface undergoes a multi-step process involving intermediate products such as formic acid and formaldehyde, and nally they are converted into CH 4 and CH 3 OH. According to the above-discussed results, a possible mechanism of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was proposed as illustrated in Fig. 12.Under the irradiation of UV-visible light, the g-C 3 N 4 sample is excited and generates holes and electrons. Those holes can be utilized to produce plenty of H with water.Meanwhile, the photo-generated electrons are involved in a series of photocatalytic reactions with a multi-electron process. 4,17,5253354 Briey, the adsorbed CO 2 on the surface is rstly reduced into HCOOH species with 2e A and 2H .Then these intermediate products are subsequently reduced into HCHO, CH 3 OH and CH 4 species step by step. 5556657 Besides, the 2e A from g-C 3 N 4 and 2H from the surrounding environment are required for each step of the reaction.Finally, the CO 2 molecules can be converted into CH 4 and CH 3 OH chemical fuels under the irradiation of light. The charge transfer dynamics taking place on the bulk-CN and NS-CN were analysed by transient photocurrent responses, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and timeresolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectroscopy.As shown in Fig. 13a, the photocurrent intensity of NS-CN is notably higher than that of the bulk-CN with several on-off cycles of light irradiation, indicating more efficient electron-hole pair transfer and separation on the NS-CN photocatalyst.Note that the current intensity of NS-CN shows a gradual increase as the light is turned on, and gradual decrease as the light is turned off.Such a phenomenon is caused by the relaxation effect during excitation and de-excitation processes. 39,58For NS-CN, the number of surface delocalized p bonds is higher than that for the bulk-CN due to the larger number of exposed aromatic heterocycles aer exfoliation.A large portion of photogenerated electrons in the conduction band of NS-CN can be gradually accumulated because of these delocalized p bonds.Therefore, the photocurrent gradually increased due to the photogenerated electrons stored in these delocalized p bonds.On the other hand, when the light is turned off, the stored electrons are gradually released from the surface delocalized p bonds and then transferred to the working electrode, leading to a gradual decrease of the photocurrent to zero.Hence, the enrichment of photogenerated electrons in the delocalized p bonds can reduce the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes, and consequently facilitate the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 molecules and formation of CH 4 and CH 3 OH, which are eightelectron and six-electron processes of CO 2 photoreduction, respectively. EIS Nyquist plots obtained for the bulk-CN and NS-CN are shown in Fig. 13b.In the analog equivalent circuit (inset of Fig. 13b), R ctr represents the charge-transfer resistance of the working electrode, R sr represents the solution resistance (Na 2 SO 4 ), and CPE represents the constant phase element between the electrolyte solution and electrode.The size of the semicircular arc in the Nyquist plots here reects R ctr , 59 which is estimated as 2.2 and 6.4 kU for NS-CN and bulk-CN, respectively.Namely, a smaller semicircle radius implies lower charge-transfer resistance and thus a faster charge-transfer rate in NS-CN due to its ultrathin structure. The TRPL spectra were further recorded to investigate the lifetime of photogenerated charge carriers as shown in Fig. 13c.The curves of both bulk-CN and NS-CN can be well tted through a bi-exponential function. 6061162 The short lifetime, long lifetime, and average lifetime are 2.8, 9.5, and 6.7 ns for NS-CN, and 1.5, 6.3, and 3.4 ns for the bulk-CN, respectively.The results indicate that the lifetimes of photogenerated charge carriers in NS-CN have been remarkably prolonged as compared to those obtained for the bulk-CN, which is due to the strong electron capture ability of the surface states in NS-CN.This result combined with the transient photocurrent response and EIS analysis indicates that a signicantly enhanced transfer and separation efficiency can be achieved over the NS-CN photocatalyst, which is one of the crucial factors to facilitate the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction."}, {"llm generation": "g-C 3 N 4", "source": "In summary, the essence of the enhancement of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity over hierarchical g-C 3 N 4 assembled by amine-functionalized ultra-thin nanosheets can be ascribed to several aspects.", "context": "In summary, the essence of the enhancement of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity over hierarchical g-C 3 N 4 assembled by amine-functionalized ultra-thin nanosheets can be ascribed to several aspects.Firstly, the formation of ultrathin nanosheets (3 nm) endows g-C 3 N 4 with (1) a much higher specic surface area (116 m 2 g A1 ) and abundant surface active sites, (2) a more negative CB and more positive VB for a stronger redox ability of photogenerated charge carriers, and (3) a shorter diffusion distance of charge carriers to the surface of g-C 3 N 4 for efficient charge transfer and separation.Secondly, the formation of hierarchical structures further enlarges the specic surface area and mesoporosity, which subsequently facilitates the diffusion and adsorption of molecules and charge transfer, as well as strengthens light harvesting.Finally, amine-functionalization of g-C 3 N 4 can remarkably promote CO 2 adsorption through base-acid interactions.As a result, the photocatalytic generation rates of CH 4 and CH 3 OH increased by 10 times and 5 times, respectively, as compared to those of the bulk-g-C 3 N 4 .Hence this work provides a promising strategy to improve the photocatalytic activity of g-C 3 N 4 by simultaneous texture modication and surface functionalization.

To further study the hierarchical structure of NS-CN, its N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms were obtained and are shown in Fig. 3.Both bulk-CN and NS-CN possess type IV nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms according to the BDDT (Brunauer-Deming-Demin-Teller) classication, indicating that the multilayer adsorption and capillary condensation/ evaporation take place during nitrogen adsorption-desorption processes. 26,27Besides, the shape of both hysteresis loops is H3 type according to the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) classication, revealing that these layered materials have slit-shaped pores due to aggregation of ake-like particles. 2627728 Importantly, NS-CN shows much higher N 2 adsorption capacity than the bulk-CN in the full range of relative pressures (P/P 0 ).This is because of the existence of larger amount of mesopores in the NS-CN sample.The pore size distribution (PSD) curves (inset in Fig. 3) show that despite the presence of macropores in both samples, a much more intense peak appeared in the PSD curve at the pore sizes of about 3 nm for NS-CN as compared to that for the bulk-CN.The specic surface area, total pore volume and average pore size of NS-CN are 116 m 2 g A1 , 0.35 cm 3 g A1 , and 14.5 nm, respectively, which all are greatly improved as compared to those of bulk-CN (15 m 2 g A1 , 0.11 cm 3 g A1 , and 23.6 nm, respectively).These results conrm the formation of hierarchical structures during the assembly of ultrathin nanosheets, which consequently increases the specic surface area and facilitates mass diffusion and transfer due to the presence of interconnected porous networks, as well as improves light harvesting through lightscattering effects. 9,29T-IR spectra (Fig. 4) were measured to investigate the surface properties of the bulk-CN and NS-CN samples.Both spectra display a sharp peak at 810 cm A1 that corresponds to the characteristic breathing mode of tri-s-triazine heterocycles, revealing that the tri-s-triazine-based structure was not broken during the NH 3 -mediated thermal exfoliation process. 30The peaks in the region of 1200-1700 cm A1 originate from different vibration modes of the C-N bond within the tri-s-triazine rings. 11,31Moreover, the broad absorption band from 3000 to 3400 cm A1 can be ascribed to various vibration modes of the N-H bond, 31,32 implying the existence of amino groups on the surface of both g-C 3 N 4 samples.Note that the transmissivity of this N-H related band in the IR spectrum (inset) of bulk-CN and NS-CN is 55 and 43, respectively, indicating that more amino groups are introduced onto the surface of g-C 3 N 4 during the NH 3 -mediated thermal treatment.The amino groups are expected to enhance the CO 2 adsorption ability through base-acid interactions. 13,14,33he chemical states of surface elements were analyzed by XPS.The full survey spectra in Fig. 5a indicate the existence of C, N and O elements in both bulk-CN and NS-CN samples.The high-resolution spectra of C 1s shown in Fig. 5b can be tted into two peaks at 284.8 and 287.8 eV.The former corresponds to sp 2 C-C bonding from surface adventitious carbon 34,35 and the latter is attributed to the characteristic NC-N 2 bonding in the molecular structure of g-C 3 N 4 . 36Fig. 5c shows the high-resolution N 1s spectra.The peaks at binding energies of 398.2 and 399.7 eV are assigned to sp 2 -hybridized nitrogen atoms (CN-C) and bridging nitrogen atoms ((C) 3 -N), respectively. 37The peak centered at 401.2 eV is indicative of N-H bonding, and the weak peak at 404.1 eV is due to the charging effects caused by p excitations. 38Additionally, a single peak is also observed at 532.3 eV (Fig. 5d), which is ascribed to adsorbed H 2 O or CO 2 on the surface. 39It is noteworthy that all the peaks in the highresolution spectra of C and N elements show no shi, suggesting that the main molecular structure of g-C 3 N 4 on the basis of tri-s-triazine was not affected during the NH 3 -mediated thermal exfoliation process.However, the estimated molar ratios of C/N in the bulk-CN and NS-CN according to the XPS analysis are 0.73 and 0.65, respectively.The signal intensity of the tted peaks (inset, Fig. 5c) of amino nitrogen atoms in the NS-CN sample is higher than that of bulk-CN, implying that the NS-CN sample possesses more marginal amino groups than bulk-CN.Furthermore, the elemental analysis conrms that the content of the hydrogen element on the surface of NS-CN and bulk-CN is 1.177 and 0.861, respectively.Besides, the content of nitrogen in NS-CN and bulk-CN is 63.74 and 63.51, respectively, based on the elemental analysis.An increase in the H and N contents in NS-CN can be attributed to the introduction of amino groups as discussed above. Zeta potentials measured for the bulk-CN and NS-CN samples in aqueous solution at different pH values reveal the variation of surface charges, as shown in Fig. 6.Normally, there are primary (CNH 2 ), secondary (C 2 NH) and tertiary (C 3 N) amino groups in the structure of g-C 3 N 4 .The CNH 2 and C 2 NH amino groups exist in the marginal part of the g-C 3 N 4 framework due to an incomplete condensation of melem, while the C 3 N amino groups exist in the conjugated plane composed of tri-s-triazine heterocyclic rings.Particularly, the CNH 2 and C 2 NH groups can accept either hydroxyl ions or protons in the aqueous solution at different pH values.However, the C 3 N groups are regarded as only proton acceptors because of the existence of lone pair electrons in sp 2 hybridised N atoms. 34,35The isoelectric points (IEPs) of the bulk-CN and NS-CN samples were measured to be 4.82 and 5.76, respectively.Since the number of the exposed internal C 3 N groups aer exfoliation of the bulk-CN into ultrathin nanosheets is higher, the proton adsorption capacity of NS-CN is higher as evidenced by its larger IEP value.These more exposed C 3 N groups with lone pair electrons of N are actually Lewis base sites and can serve as adsorption sites for CO 2 molecules. 40 higher affinity of a photocatalyst toward CO 2 is benecial for surface catalytic reactions. 19,41Once CO 2 molecules are trapped by active sites on the surface of a photocatalyst, they can be reduced by photoelectrons and converted into fuels such as CH 4 , CH 3 OH and so on. 17,42As such, CO 2 adsorption curves were measured and are shown in Fig. 7.As can be seen from this gure the NS-CN sample shows a remarkably enlarged CO 2 adsorption, which is more than 4 times higher than that measured for the bulk-CN.The much higher CO 2 adsorption capacity of NS-CN in the pressure range studied can be mainly attributed to the improved physical adsorption that originates from the high specic area and well developed porosity as well as chemical adsorption of CO 2 molecules on amine groups.In addition, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were employed to evaluate the adsorption energy (E a ) of CO 2 molecules on the photocatalysts studied.As dened here, a more negative E a value suggests stronger adsorption of CO 2 on the surface of a photocatalyst. 43The optimized congurations of CO 2 adsorbed on the surface of the bulk-CN and NS-CN are shown in Fig. 8. Particularly, the calculated adsorption energy (E a ) of the bulk-CN and NS-CN is A0.99 and A1.37 eV, respectively.The results indicate that the NS-CN sample shows a higher adsorption affinity toward CO 2 under identical conditions, which is benecial for photocatalytic CO 2 conversion. Fig. 9a shows the UV-Vis absorption spectra of the bulk-CN and NS-CN.The absorption edge of the bulk-CN is 455 nm, which corresponds to the band gap of 2.72 eV according to the Kubelka-Munk function (inset of Fig. 9a).However, an obvious blue shi of the absorption edge visible in the spectrum of NS-CN gives rise to an enlarged band gap of 2.98 eV.This is due to the quantum size effect of the ultrathin structure of NS-CN. 44An enhanced light absorption in the wide range of 450-800 nm is also observed for NS-CN, caused by the light-scattering effects of the hierarchical structures, which can promote surface photocatalytic reactions.The Mott-Schottky plots (Fig. 9b andc) and XPS valence band (VB) spectra (Fig. 9d) are further measured to elucidate the CB and VB positions of the bulk-CN and NS-CN.Both samples are n-type semiconductors based on the Mott-Schottky plots.The at-band potentials are A1.16 and A1.25 V (vs.NHE, pH 14 7) for the bulk-CN and NS-CN, respectively, while their VB values from XPS are determined to be 1.58 and 1.76 V, respectively.Therefore the band structures can be well resolved as illustrated in Fig. 9e.It is noteworthy that NS-CN possesses a more negative CB and more positive VB as compared to those of bulk-CN, indicating a stronger reduction and oxidation ability for photogenerated charge carriers. 9,45he electronic structures of the bulk-CN and NS-CN were also investigated by DFT calculations.The density of states (DOS) (Fig. 10) shows that their CBs are comprised of N 2p and C 2p orbitals, while their VBs mainly consist of N 2s and N 2p orbitals.The calculated band gap values of the bulk-CN and NS-CN are 1.07 and 1.18 eV, respectively, which are smaller than the above-discussed experimental values due to the limitation of DFT calculations. 16,46However, this result is still indicative and reveals that NS-CN has a relatively wide band gap as compared to that of the bulk-CN material, which is consistent with the experimental results. Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction experiments were carried out to evaluate the photocatalytic properties of the as-prepared samples.As shown in Fig. 11a, successful CO 2 conversion into CH 4 and CH 3 OH occurred in the presence of g-C 3 N 4 photocatalysts.Obviously, the generation rates of both CH 4 and CH 3 OH for NS-CN are greatly enhanced, which are 10 and 5 times higher than the corresponding values obtained for the bulk-CN, respectively. The in situ FTIR spectra of NS-CN were analyzed to understand the conversion process of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.As shown in Fig. 11b andc, the peaks at 1512, 1438, 1631, 1265 and 1048 cm A1 belong to the carbonate species. 47,48The peaks at 1286, 1326, 1386, 1532, 1558, 1641 and 1695 cm A1 are ascribed to formate. 4950051 The peaks at 1419, 1458, 1607 and 1657 cm A1 refer to formaldehyde. 48Besides, the peaks at 1732 and 1103 cm A1 are attributed to the vibration of methoxyl groups, which originate from methanol. 47The remaining peaks at 1716 and 1756 cm A1 are assigned to the carboxylate and carbonyl groups, respectively. 48,50CH 4 was not detected due to its nonpolar nature and low affinity toward the g-C 3 N 4 surface.It is clear that prior to irradiation, primary carbonate species were rst detected on the surface of the photocatalyst in the presence of CO 2 and water vapor in the reaction system.Aer the irradiation of monochromatic light (365 nm), formate, formaldehyde and methanol appeared and their amount gradually increased accompanied by a simultaneous decrease of carbonate species, although CH 4 molecules could not be detected due to their nonpolar nature and low affinity toward the g-C 3 N 4 surface.The results indicate that the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 into hydrocarbon fuels on the g-C 3 N 4 surface undergoes a multi-step process involving intermediate products such as formic acid and formaldehyde, and nally they are converted into CH 4 and CH 3 OH. According to the above-discussed results, a possible mechanism of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was proposed as illustrated in Fig. 12.Under the irradiation of UV-visible light, the g-C 3 N 4 sample is excited and generates holes and electrons. Those holes can be utilized to produce plenty of H with water.Meanwhile, the photo-generated electrons are involved in a series of photocatalytic reactions with a multi-electron process. 4,17,5253354 Briey, the adsorbed CO 2 on the surface is rstly reduced into HCOOH species with 2e A and 2H .Then these intermediate products are subsequently reduced into HCHO, CH 3 OH and CH 4 species step by step. 5556657 Besides, the 2e A from g-C 3 N 4 and 2H from the surrounding environment are required for each step of the reaction.Finally, the CO 2 molecules can be converted into CH 4 and CH 3 OH chemical fuels under the irradiation of light. The charge transfer dynamics taking place on the bulk-CN and NS-CN were analysed by transient photocurrent responses, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and timeresolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectroscopy.As shown in Fig. 13a, the photocurrent intensity of NS-CN is notably higher than that of the bulk-CN with several on-off cycles of light irradiation, indicating more efficient electron-hole pair transfer and separation on the NS-CN photocatalyst.Note that the current intensity of NS-CN shows a gradual increase as the light is turned on, and gradual decrease as the light is turned off.Such a phenomenon is caused by the relaxation effect during excitation and de-excitation processes. 39,58For NS-CN, the number of surface delocalized p bonds is higher than that for the bulk-CN due to the larger number of exposed aromatic heterocycles aer exfoliation.A large portion of photogenerated electrons in the conduction band of NS-CN can be gradually accumulated because of these delocalized p bonds.Therefore, the photocurrent gradually increased due to the photogenerated electrons stored in these delocalized p bonds.On the other hand, when the light is turned off, the stored electrons are gradually released from the surface delocalized p bonds and then transferred to the working electrode, leading to a gradual decrease of the photocurrent to zero.Hence, the enrichment of photogenerated electrons in the delocalized p bonds can reduce the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes, and consequently facilitate the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 molecules and formation of CH 4 and CH 3 OH, which are eightelectron and six-electron processes of CO 2 photoreduction, respectively. EIS Nyquist plots obtained for the bulk-CN and NS-CN are shown in Fig. 13b.In the analog equivalent circuit (inset of Fig. 13b), R ctr represents the charge-transfer resistance of the working electrode, R sr represents the solution resistance (Na 2 SO 4 ), and CPE represents the constant phase element between the electrolyte solution and electrode.The size of the semicircular arc in the Nyquist plots here reects R ctr , 59 which is estimated as 2.2 and 6.4 kU for NS-CN and bulk-CN, respectively.Namely, a smaller semicircle radius implies lower charge-transfer resistance and thus a faster charge-transfer rate in NS-CN due to its ultrathin structure. The TRPL spectra were further recorded to investigate the lifetime of photogenerated charge carriers as shown in Fig. 13c.The curves of both bulk-CN and NS-CN can be well tted through a bi-exponential function. 6061162 The short lifetime, long lifetime, and average lifetime are 2.8, 9.5, and 6.7 ns for NS-CN, and 1.5, 6.3, and 3.4 ns for the bulk-CN, respectively.The results indicate that the lifetimes of photogenerated charge carriers in NS-CN have been remarkably prolonged as compared to those obtained for the bulk-CN, which is due to the strong electron capture ability of the surface states in NS-CN.This result combined with the transient photocurrent response and EIS analysis indicates that a signicantly enhanced transfer and separation efficiency can be achieved over the NS-CN photocatalyst, which is one of the crucial factors to facilitate the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction."}, {"llm generation": "UV-Vis", "source": "Fig. 9 (a) UV-Vis absorption spectra.", "context": "In summary, the essence of the enhancement of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity over hierarchical g-C 3 N 4 assembled by amine-functionalized ultra-thin nanosheets can be ascribed to several aspects.Firstly, the formation of ultrathin nanosheets (3 nm) endows g-C 3 N 4 with (1) a much higher specic surface area (116 m 2 g A1 ) and abundant surface active sites, (2) a more negative CB and more positive VB for a stronger redox ability of photogenerated charge carriers, and (3) a shorter diffusion distance of charge carriers to the surface of g-C 3 N 4 for efficient charge transfer and separation.Secondly, the formation of hierarchical structures further enlarges the specic surface area and mesoporosity, which subsequently facilitates the diffusion and adsorption of molecules and charge transfer, as well as strengthens light harvesting.Finally, amine-functionalization of g-C 3 N 4 can remarkably promote CO 2 adsorption through base-acid interactions.As a result, the photocatalytic generation rates of CH 4 and CH 3 OH increased by 10 times and 5 times, respectively, as compared to those of the bulk-g-C 3 N 4 .Hence this work provides a promising strategy to improve the photocatalytic activity of g-C 3 N 4 by simultaneous texture modication and surface functionalization.
