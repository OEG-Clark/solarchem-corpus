64,65 while g-C 3 N 4 /KNbO 3 displayed a slightly lower binding energy of C 1s (287.9 eV) than that of pure g-C 3 N 4 .The inner shi of the C 1s peak possibly originated from the hybridization effect between g-C 3 N 4 and KNbO 3 .As displayed in Fig. 3b, N 1s peak located at 398.9 eV (g-C 3 N 4 ) and 398.8 eV (g-C 3 N 4 /KNbO 3 ) originated from CN-C coordination. 66,67The binding energies of K 2p 3/2 (290.7 eV) and K 2p 1/2 (293.4eV) for KNbO 3 were much lower than those of K 2p 3/2 (292.5 eV) and K 2p 1/2 (295.2eV) in g-C 3 N 4 /KNbO 3 (see in Fig. 3c).In addition, the binding energies of Nb 3d 3/2 (208.7 eV), Nb 3d 5/2 (206.0 eV) and O 1s (528.9 eV) of pure KNbO 3 were slightly lower than those of Nb 3d 3/2 (209.3 eV), Nb 3d 5/2 (206.6 eV) and O 1s (529.6 eV) of g-C 3 N 4 /KNbO 3 (see in Fig. 3d ande).This implied that chemical interaction was possibly exited between KNbO 3 and g-C 3 N 4 . 63In addition, the content was estimated by XPS measurement.The molar ratio of C 3 N 4 and KNbO 3 is 5.4 : 1, corresponding to the mass ratio of g-C 3 N 4 and KNbO 3 (2.8 : 1). The morphologies and microstructures of g-C 3 N 4 , KNbO 3 , and g-C 3 N 4 /KNbO 3 samples were checked by FE-SEM.Fig. 4 displays the FE-SEM images of g-C 3 N 4 , KNbO 3 , and g-C 3 N 4 / KNbO 3 composite.It was revealed that g-C 3 N 4 showed the aggregated layered structure with several stacking layers (Fig. 4a).As shown in Fig. 4b, the KNbO 3 sample displayed as the stacked structures, which consisted of cube-shaped particles with several hundred nanometers in size.As displayed in Fig. 4c, amounts of KNbO 3 were found to randomly deposit and distribute on the surface of g-C 3 N 4 , resulting in forming a heterostructured g-C 3 N 4 /KNbO 3 material.Further EDX results (Fig. S1 ) indicated that the composite sample was composed of C, N, K, Nb, and O elements.Additionally, the EDS element maps of the composite displayed the element distribution of g-C 3 N 4 /KNbO 3 , which was consistent with that in the SEM images.Aiming at getting the further information about the microstructures of the g-C 3 N 4 /KNbO 3 , HRTEM analysis was performed.Fig. 5 shows the low-and high-magnication TEM images of the as-prepared g-C 3 N 4 /KNbO 3 .Based on the observed morphologies of KNbO 3 and g-C 3 N 4 in SEM images (Fig. 4), the dark parts in the TEM image (Fig. 5a) should correspond to KNbO 3 while the light parts were ascribed to C 3 N 4 , which further implies that KNbO 3 are located on the surface of g-C 3 N 4 .It was note that the ultrasonication in TEM measurement do not peel off the composite due to the strong interaction between g-C 3 N 4 and KNbO 3 .Additionally, smooth and clear interfaces were observed between the g-C 3 N 4 and KNbO 3 , which implied the formation of g-C 3 N 4 /KNbO 3 composites.As shown in Fig. 5b, the clear lattice fringe in HRTEM should be ascribed to KNbO 3 , and the d spacing value was 0.286 nm, corresponding to the (110) plane of orthorhombic-structured KNbO 3 ; while the low crystallinity with blurry lattices corresponded to g-C 3 N 4 . 40The observed intimate interface was generally expected to be helpful for promote the separation of photogenerated carriers between C 3 N 4 and KNbO 3 and thus improved the photocatalytic activity. Fig. 6 displays the CH 4 evolution amounts over Pt loaded KNbO 3 , g-C 3 N 4 , and g-C 3 N 4 /KNbO 3 composite photocatalysts.It was observed that the CH 4 was generated and increased with the prolongation of irradiation time over Pt loaded g-C 3 N 4 / KNbO 3 and g-C 3 N 4 samples; while KNbO 3 showed hardly CH 4 generation under the same reaction conditions since KNbO 3 could be scarcely responsive to visible light.As shown in Fig. 6, the CH 4 generation amount over Pt-g-C 3 N 4 /KNbO 3 was higher than that of Pt-g-C 3 N 4 .Namely, during the rst 8 h irradiation, the rate of CH 4 generation over Pt-g-C 3 N 4 /KNbO 3 was as high as 0.25 mmol h A1 in contrast to that of Pt-g-C 3 N 4 (0.06 mmol h A1 ), indicating that composite photocatalyst notably enhanced the photocatalytic performance compared with the naked photocatalyst.In order to check the repeatability of photocatalytic performance, the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction over used Pt-g-C 3 N 4 /KNbO 3 sample was performed again.It was worthwhile to note that the photocatalytic activity of used sample was similar to that of the fresh sample (see in Fig. S2 ).In order to investigate the structural stability, we checked XRD patterns of Pt-g-C 3 N 4 /KNbO 3 sample before and aer the photocatalytic reaction.As shown in Fig. 7, there was no obvious peak variation was observed in the XRD patterns of Pt-g-C 3 N 4 /KNbO 3 aer the photocatalytic reaction, indicating that the phase of g-C 3 N 4 / KNbO 3 catalyst was relative stable without structural variation occurrence during the present photocatalytic reaction process. One can see that, although g-C 3 N 4 /KNbO 3 and g-C 3 N 4 have similar optical absorption, their photocatalytic activities in the photoreduction of CO 2 are apparently different.This implies that there should be another crucial factor that affects the photocatalytic activities notably.Actually, in addition to the optical absorption, the efficient charge separation of a semiconductor usually plays a crucial role in governing its photocatalytic performance.Herein, band potentials of g-C 3 N 4 and KNbO 3 were investigated in order to clarify the charge separation in the g-C 3 N 4 /KNbO 3 interfaces.The band edge positions of photocatalysts were calculated using the following equation: E VB 14 X A E e 0.5E g , 68697071 where E VB is the top of valance band (VB) relative to the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE); E g means the band gap energy of the photocatalyst, E e is the energy of free electrons (4.5 eV), X X 14 ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi ffi geometric mean of the Mulliken electronegativity of the constituent atoms in the semiconductor.The Mulliken electronegativity of an atom is the arithmetic mean of the atomic electron affinity and the rst ionization energy.Subsequently, VB edge potential of KNbO 3 was determined to be 2.39 eV relative to the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE), and E CB of KNbO 3 was calculated to be A0.81 eV from the band gap in the view of the method inherent error (0.2 eV).While the CB and VB edge potentials of g-C 3 N 4 were obtained to be A1.13 and 1.57 eV, respectively, which was similar to the previous report. 62It was noted that the VB top of KNbO 3 was lower than that of g-C 3 N 4 , while the CB bottom of C 3 N 4 was higher than that of KNbO 3 .In view of the above results and previous reports, 727374757677 such a possible mechanism for the photocatalytic activity over the present g-C 3 N 4 /KNbO 3 is proposed and schematically illustrated in Fig. 8.The electron and hole pairs are excited upon light irradiation in g-C 3 N 4 , which serves as a sensitiser to absorb photons in the heterostructured photocatalysts.Subsequently, the photoexcited electrons on g-C 3 N 4 could transfer to the CB of KNbO 3 since the CB edge potential of g-C 3 N 4 (A1.13 eV) is more negative than that of KNbO 3 (A0.81eV).It is generally acknowledged that noble metal Pt can act as a superior acceptor and trapping site for photo-excited electrons due to the different work function.Hence the photoinduced electrons would quickly transfer to the loaded Pt metal and then reduce CO 2 into CH 4 .By such a vectorial electron transport manner, the photoexcited electron-holes in the heterostructured composite were spatially separated efficiently, resulting in an enhanced photocatalytic activity of g-C 3 N 4 / KNbO 3 .In addition, the composition amount in the composite usually plays an important role in determining the photocatalytic activity.As shown in Fig. S3, all the g-C 3 N 4 /KNbO 3 composite samples exhibited higher CH 4 evolution amounts than pure g-C 3 N 4 .It was noted that the KNbO 3 content inuenced the photocatalytic activities of the composites asprepared materials notably.With an increase of KNbO 3 concentration from 15 to 25, the photocatalytic activity increased and exhibited a CH 4 production yield of 1.94 mmol, which was more than four times higher than that of pure g-C 3 N 4 .However, excessive deposition of KNbO 3 possibly led to shielding the g-C 3 N 4 surfaces, and subsequently decreased the photocatalytic activity. 51,55n order to verify the above-proposed mechanism, photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy measurements were performed to analysis the process of charge carrier trapping and transfer.It is widely recognized that the lower uorescence intensity means less recombination of photoinduced electron-hole pairs, leading to a higher photocatalytic activity. 78As a reference, g-C 3 N 4 and KNbO 3 with the same weight ratio as g-C 3 N 4 /KNbO 3 were also physically mixed.It was seen from Fig. S4 that pure g-C 3 N 4 excited at 350 nm displayed a main emission peak at 460 nm, which originated from the band-band PL process of self-trapped excitations. 79The emission intensity of physically mixed g-C 3 N 4 -KNbO 3 was lower than that of pure g-C 3 N 4 at a similar emission position, which could be primarily attributed to the decrease of g-C 3 N 4 concentration. 51As for g-C 3 N 4 /KNbO 3 composite, the emission intensity displayed an obvious decrease, suggesting that the recombination rate of carriers in the composite decreased due to photogenerated carrier transfer between g-C 3 N 4 and KNbO 3 , which was similar to the previous reports. 51,80All these suggest some meaningful information to design an effective photocatalysts for CO 2 reduction."}, {"llm generation": "Pt", "source": "Fig. 6 displays the CH 4

398.9 eV (g-C 3 N 4 ) and 398.8 eV (g-C 3 N 4 /KNbO 3 ) originated from CN-C coordination. 66,67The binding energies of K 2p 3/2 (290.7 eV) and K 2p 1/2 (293.4eV) for KNbO 3 were much lower than those of K 2p 3/2 (292.5 eV) and K 2p 1/2 (295.2eV) in g-C 3 N 4 /KNbO 3 (see in Fig. 3c).In addition, the binding energies of Nb 3d 3/2 (208.7 eV), Nb 3d 5/2 (206.0 eV) and O 1s (528.9 eV) of pure KNbO 3 were slightly lower than those of Nb 3d 3/2 (209.3 eV), Nb 3d 5/2 (206.6 eV) and O 1s (529.6 eV) of g-C 3 N 4 /KNbO 3 (see in Fig. 3d ande).This implied that chemical interaction was possibly exited

Fig. 6 displays the CH 4 evolution amounts over Pt loaded KNbO 3 , g-C 3 N 4 , and g-C 3 N 4 /KNbO 3 composite photocatalysts.It was observed that the CH 4 was generated and increased with the prolongation of irradiation time over Pt loaded g-C 3 N 4 / KNbO 3 and g-C 3 N 4 samples; while KNbO 3 showed hardly CH 4 generation under the same reaction conditions since KNbO 3 could be scarcely responsive to visible light.As shown in Fig. 6, the CH 4 generation amount over Pt-g-C 3 N 4 /KNbO 3 was higher than that of Pt-g-C 3 N 4 .Namely, during the rst 8 h irradiation, the rate of CH 4 generation over Pt-g-C 3 N 4 /KNbO 3 was as high as 0.25 mmol h A1 in contrast to that of Pt-g-C 3 N 4 (0.06 mmol h A1 ), indicating that composite photocatalyst notably enhanced the photocatalytic performance compared with the naked photocatalyst.In order to check the repeatability of photocatalytic performance, the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction over used Pt-g-C 3 N 4 /KNbO 3 sample was performed again.It was worthwhile to note that the photocatalytic activity of used sample was similar to that of the fresh sample (see in Fig. S2 ).In order to investigate the structural stability, we checked XRD patterns of Pt-g-C 3 N 4 /KNbO 3 sample before and aer the photocatalytic reaction.As shown in Fig. 7, there was no obvious peak variation was observed in the XRD patterns of Pt-g-C 3 N 4 /KNbO 3 aer the photocatalytic reaction, indicating that the phase of g-C 3 N 4 / KNbO 3 catalyst was relative stable without structural variation occurrence during the present photocatalytic reaction process. One can see that, although g-C 3 N 4 /KNbO 3 and g-C 3 N 4 have similar optical absorption, their photocatalytic activities in the photoreduction of CO 2 are apparently different.This implies that there should be another crucial factor that affects the photocatalytic activities notably.Actually, in addition to the optical absorption, the efficient charge separation of a semiconductor usually plays a crucial role in governing its photocatalytic performance.Herein, band potentials of g-C 3 N 4 and KNbO 3 were investigated in order to clarify the charge separation in the g-C 3 N 4 /KNbO 3 interfaces.The band edge positions of photocatalysts were calculated using the following equation: E VB 14 X A E e 0.5E g , 68697071 where E VB is the top of valance band (VB) relative to the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE); E g means the band gap energy of the photocatalyst, E e is the energy of free electrons (4.5 eV), X X 14 ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi ffi geometric mean of the Mulliken electronegativity of the constituent atoms in the semiconductor.The Mulliken electronegativity of an atom is the arithmetic mean of the atomic electron affinity and the rst ionization energy.Subsequently, VB edge potential of KNbO 3 was determined to be 2.39 eV relative to the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE), and E CB of KNbO 3 was calculated to be A0.81 eV from the band gap in the view of the method inherent error (0.2 eV).While the CB and VB edge potentials of g-C 3 N 4 were obtained to be A1.13 and 1.57 eV, respectively, which was similar to the previous report. 62It was noted that the VB top of KNbO 3 was lower than that of g-C 3 N 4 , while the CB bottom of C 3 N 4 was higher than that of KNbO 3 .In view of the above results and previous reports, 727374757677 such a possible mechanism for the photocatalytic activity over the present g-C 3 N 4 /KNbO 3 is proposed and schematically illustrated in Fig. 8.The electron and hole pairs are excited upon light irradiation in g-C 3 N 4 , which serves as a sensitiser to absorb photons in the heterostructured photocatalysts.Subsequently, the photoexcited electrons on g-C 3 N 4 could transfer to the CB of KNbO 3 since the CB edge potential of g-C 3 N 4 (A1.13 eV) is more negative than that of KNbO 3 (A0.81eV).It is generally acknowledged that noble metal Pt can act as a superior acceptor and trapping site for photo-excited electrons due to the different work function.Hence the photoinduced electrons would quickly transfer to the loaded Pt metal and then reduce CO 2 into CH 4 .By such a vectorial electron transport manner, the photoexcited electron-holes in the heterostructured composite were spatially separated efficiently, resulting in an enhanced photocatalytic activity of g-C 3 N 4 / KNbO 3 .In addition, the composition amount in the composite usually plays an important role in determining the photocatalytic activity.As shown in Fig. S3, all the g-C 3 N 4 /KNbO 3 composite samples exhibited higher CH 4 evolution amounts than pure g-C 3 N 4 .It was noted that the KNbO 3 content inuenced the photocatalytic activities of the composites asprepared materials notably.With an increase of KNbO 3 concentration from 15 to 25, the photocatalytic activity increased and exhibited a CH 4 production yield of 1.94 mmol, which was more than four times higher than that of pure g-C 3 N 4 .However, excessive deposition of KNbO 3 possibly led to shielding the g-C 3 N 4 surfaces, and subsequently decreased the photocatalytic activity. 51,55n order to verify the above-proposed mechanism, photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy measurements were performed to analysis the process of charge carrier trapping and transfer.It is widely recognized that the lower uorescence intensity means less recombination of photoinduced electron-hole pairs, leading to a higher photocatalytic activity. 78As a reference, g-C 3 N 4 and KNbO 3 with the same weight ratio as g-C 3 N 4 /KNbO 3 were also physically mixed.It was seen from Fig. S4 that pure g-C 3 N 4 excited at 350 nm displayed a main emission peak at 460 nm, which originated from the band-band PL process of self-trapped excitations. 79The emission intensity of physically mixed g-C 3 N 4 -KNbO 3 was lower than that of pure g-C 3 N 4 at a similar emission position, which could be primarily attributed to the decrease of g-C 3 N 4 concentration. 51As for g-C 3 N 4 /KNbO 3 composite, the emission intensity displayed an obvious decrease, suggesting that the recombination rate of carriers in the composite decreased due to photogenerated carrier transfer between g-C 3 N 4 and KNbO 3 , which was similar to the previous reports. 51,80All these suggest some meaningful information to design an effective photocatalysts for CO 2 reduction."}, {"llm generation": "g-C 3 N 4 /KNbO 3 composite photocatalyst",

Subsequently, the mixture was constantly stirred for 4 h and then poured into a Teon-lined autoclave with a heat treatment at 150 C for 3 days.Aer cooling to room temperature, the obtained precipitate was washed thoroughly with distilled water several times and dried in an oven at 80 C for 12 h.The metalfree g-C 3 N 4 powders were synthesized by heating melamine in air at 520 C for 4 h in a muffle furnace.The resulting yellow products were naturally cooled to room temperature and ground into powders.The g-C 3 N 4 /KNbO 3 composites were prepared as follows: rstly, the methanol solution containing g-C 3 N 4 and KNbO 3 (25 wt KNbO 3 ) was ultrasonicated for 60 min and then constantly stirred for 6 h.Aer that, the product was washed with distilled water and dried in an oven at 90 C for 24 h.Finally, the obtained samples were heated to 500 C for 2 h.For comparison, the g-C 3 N 4 powder was also treated with the same treatment process of composite.The Pt loaded photocatalysts were synthesized by an in situ photodeposition method.Typically, 0.1 g photocatalyst, 40 mL distilled water, 25 mL CH 3 OH and a given amount of H 2 PtCl 6 6H 2 O (0.5 wt) were placed in a glass vessel.The reactant solution was irradiated by a 300 W Xe arc lamp for 8 h with constantly stirring.Then the Pt-loaded photocatalysts were ltered and washed thoroughly with deionized water, subsequently dried at 80 C for 24 h. The compositions and crystal structures of samples were iden-tied by a powder X-ray diffractometer (DX2700, Dandong, China) employing Cu Ka radiation in the 2q range of 10-90 .The diffuse reectance spectra of the samples were measured using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (UV-2600; Shimadzu, Japan) equipped with an integrating sphere attachment.Morphologies of samples were characterized by a eld-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM; FEI Tecnai G2 F30, USA) equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and a high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM; FEI Tecnai G20, USA).X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was carried on a multifunctional imaging electron spectrometer (Thermo ESCALAB 250XI, USA) using an Al Ka monochromatic X-ray radiation.The surface areas were determined by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method with a surface area and porosimetry analyzer (Quadrasorb evo, USA).The XPS spectra were calibrated by the C-C bonds at 284.6 eV.Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were characterized at room temperature using a uorescence spectrophotometer (FLS 920P, Edinburgh, England) with an excitation wavelength in 350 nm. In the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 , the photocatalyst (100 mg) was uniformly and evenly spread on the bottom of a small glass cell that was placed in the bottom of a Pyrex glass cell, which was attached with a gaseous closed system.A 300 W xenon arc lamp was employed as the light source for the photocatalytic reaction.Aer the reaction apparatus was vacuumtreated several times, the high purity of CO 2 gas and 2 mL of H 2 O were injected into the reaction apparatus to realize ambient pressure.In order to obtain an adsorption-desorption equilibrium, the reactor was stored in the dark condition for 2 h with a gas pump to accelerate gas diffusion.Subsequently, the reactor was irradiated from a 300 W Xe lamp quipped with a UV cutoff lter (l 420 nm).During the irradiation, a given gaseous sample was continually taken from the reaction cell at a given interval to examine the concentration of CH 4 using a gas chromatograph (GC-9790A, Fuli, China)."}, {"llm generation": "Gas", "source": "Hence the photoinduced electrons would quickly transfer to the loaded Pt metal and then reduce CO 2 into CH 4 .", "context": "The powder XRD patterns of g-C 3 N 4 /KNbO 3 composite, as well as those of g-C 3 N 4 and KNbO 3 are presented in Fig. 1.No impurity phase was observed in KNbO 3 , which was in good agreement with the XRD patterns of orthorhombic structured KNbO 3 in the JCPDS card (no.32-0822).The two distinct peaks recorded in g-C 3 N 4 XRD patterns were founded at 27.4 and 13.1 , which could be indexed as the (002) and (100) diffraction planes (JCPDS card: no.87-1526), corresponding to the characteristic interplanar staking peaks of aromatic systems and the inter-layer structural packing, 62 respectively.The XRD patterns of g-C 3 N 4 /KNbO 3 revealed the coexistence peaks of both KNbO 3 and g-C 3 N 4 , indicating the presence of two phases in the composite.Furthermore, the BET surface area of g-C 3 N 4 , g-C 3 N 4 /KNbO 3 , and KNbO 3 were measured to be 10.1, 9.4, and 12.0 m 2 g A1 , respectively.Fig. 2 displays the UV-vis absorption spectra of KNbO 3 , g-C 3 N 4 , and g-C 3 N 4 /KNbO 3 , which are transformed from the diffuse reection spectra according to the Kubelka-Munk relation.The absorbance edge of white colored KNbO 3 was located at approximately 365 nm, whereas the yellow colored g-C 3 N 4 sample could absorb visible light up to 460 nm.The g-C 3 N 4 / KNbO 3 composite exhibited a similar adsorption shoulder and a slight red shi tail on the adsorption edge that reached further out in the visible region, which was similar to the previous report. 63This clearly demonstrated that g-C 3 N 4 /KNbO 3 had potential applications in the visible-light region.The optical band gap E g of a semiconductor could be deduced according to the following equation: (ahn) n 14 A(hn A E g ), where a, hn, A, E g , n mean the absorption coefficient, the incident photo energy, a proportionality constant related to the material, the band gap energy of the semiconductor, and n direct 14 2 (or n indirect 14 1/2), respectively.As shown in the inset of Fig. 2b, the band gap energies were obtained from the intercept of the tangent line in the plot of (ahn) 1/2 vs. energy, and the values of g-C 3 N 4 and KNbO 3 were determined to be 2.7 eV and 3.2 eV, respectively, which were in consistent with the values in the previous reports. 29,63he surface chemical compositions and states of the g-C 3 N 4 , KNbO 3 , and g-C 3 N 4 /KNbO 3 were further investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy in order to investigate the interaction between KNbO 3 and g-C 3 N 4 .Fig. 3 shows C 1s and N 1s peaks of g-C 3 N 4 and g-C 3 N 4 /KNbO 3 , as well as K 2p, Nb 3d, and O 1s peaks for KNbO 3 and g-C 3 N 4 /KNbO 3 , which are undoubtedly in agreement with the chemical composition in the photocatalysts.All the binding energies were referenced to the C 1s peak at 284.6 eV of the surface adventitious carbon.As displayed in the XPS spectra of C 1s (Fig. 3a), the strong peak (288.1 eV) in g-C 3 N 4 could be assigned to sp 2 -bonded carbon in Ncontaining aromatic rings (N-CN); 64,65 while g-C 3 N 4 /KNbO 3 displayed a slightly lower binding energy of C 1s (287.9 eV) than that of pure g-C 3 N 4 .The inner shi of the C 1s peak possibly originated from the hybridization effect between g-C 3 N 4 and KNbO 3 .As displayed in Fig. 3b, N 1s peak located at 398.9 eV (g-C 3 N 4 ) and 398.8 eV (g-C 3 N 4 /KNbO 3 ) originated from CN-C coordination. 66,67The binding energies of K 2p 3/2 (290.7 eV) and K 2p 1/2 (293.4eV) for KNbO 3 were much lower than those of K 2p 3/2 (292.5 eV) and K 2p 1/2 (295.2eV) in g-C 3 N 4 /KNbO 3 (see in Fig. 3c).In addition, the binding energies of Nb 3d 3/2 (208.7 eV), Nb 3d 5/2 (206.0 eV) and O 1s (528.9 eV) of pure KNbO 3 were slightly lower than those of Nb 3d 3/2 (209.3 eV), Nb 3d 5/2 (206.6 eV) and O 1s (529.6 eV) of g-C 3 N 4 /KNbO 3 (see in Fig. 3d ande).This implied that chemical interaction was possibly exited between KNbO 3 and g-C 3 N 4 . 63In addition, the content was estimated by XPS measurement.The molar ratio of C 3 N 4 and KNbO 3 is 5.4 : 1, corresponding to the mass ratio of g-C 3 N 4 and KNbO 3 (2.8 : 1).

Fig. 6 displays the CH 4 evolution amounts over Pt loaded KNbO 3 , g-C 3 N 4 , and g-C 3 N 4 /KNbO 3 composite photocatalysts.It was observed that the CH 4 was generated and increased with the prolongation of irradiation time over Pt loaded g-C 3 N 4 / KNbO 3 and g-C 3 N 4 samples; while KNbO 3 showed hardly CH 4 generation under the same reaction conditions since KNbO 3 could be scarcely responsive to visible light.As shown in Fig. 6, the CH 4 generation amount over Pt-g-C 3 N 4 /KNbO 3 was higher than that of Pt-g-C 3 N 4 .Namely, during the rst 8 h irradiation, the rate of CH 4 generation over Pt-g-C 3 N 4 /KNbO 3 was as high as 0.25 mmol h A1 in contrast to that of Pt-g-C 3 N 4 (0.06 mmol h A1 ), indicating that composite photocatalyst notably enhanced the photocatalytic performance compared with the naked photocatalyst.In order to check the repeatability of photocatalytic performance, the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction over used Pt-g-C 3 N 4 /KNbO 3 sample was performed again.It was worthwhile to note that the photocatalytic activity of used sample was similar to that of the fresh sample (see in Fig. S2 ).In order to investigate the structural stability, we checked XRD patterns of Pt-g-C 3 N 4 /KNbO 3 sample before and aer the photocatalytic reaction.As shown in Fig. 7, there was no obvious peak variation was observed in the XRD patterns of Pt-g-C 3 N 4 /KNbO 3 aer the photocatalytic reaction, indicating that the phase of g-C 3 N 4 / KNbO 3 catalyst was relative stable without structural variation occurrence during the present photocatalytic reaction process. One can see that, although g-C 3 N 4 /KNbO 3 and g-C 3 N 4 have similar optical absorption, their photocatalytic activities in the photoreduction of CO 2 are apparently different.This implies that there should be another crucial factor that affects the photocatalytic activities notably.Actually, in addition to the optical absorption, the efficient charge separation of a semiconductor usually plays a crucial role in governing its photocatalytic performance.Herein, band potentials of g-C 3 N 4 and KNbO 3 were investigated in order to clarify the charge separation in the g-C 3 N 4 /KNbO 3 interfaces.The band edge positions of photocatalysts were calculated using the following equation: E VB 14 X A E e 0.5E g , 68697071 where E VB is the top of valance band (VB) relative to the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE); E g means the band gap energy of the photocatalyst, E e is the energy of free electrons (4.5 eV), X X 14 ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi ffi geometric mean of the Mulliken electronegativity of the constituent atoms in the semiconductor.The Mulliken electronegativity of an atom is the arithmetic mean of the atomic electron affinity and the rst ionization energy.Subsequently, VB edge potential of KNbO 3 was determined to be 2.39 eV relative to the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE), and E CB of KNbO 3 was calculated to be A0.81 eV from the band gap in the view of the method inherent error (0.2 eV).While the CB and VB edge potentials of g-C 3 N 4 were obtained to be A1.13 and 1.57 eV, respectively, which was similar to the previous report. 62It was noted that the VB top of KNbO 3 was lower than that of g-C 3 N 4 , while the CB bottom of C 3 N 4 was higher than that of KNbO 3 .In view of the above results and previous reports, 727374757677 such a possible mechanism for the photocatalytic activity over the present g-C 3 N 4 /KNbO 3 is proposed and schematically illustrated in Fig. 8.The electron and hole pairs are excited upon light irradiation in g-C 3 N 4 , which serves as a sensitiser to absorb photons in the heterostructured photocatalysts.Subsequently, the photoexcited electrons on g-C 3 N 4 could transfer to the CB of KNbO 3 since the CB edge potential of g-C 3 N 4 (A1.13 eV) is more negative than that of KNbO 3 (A0.81eV).It is generally acknowledged that noble metal Pt can act as a superior acceptor and trapping site for photo-excited electrons due to the different work function.Hence the photoinduced electrons would quickly transfer to the loaded Pt metal and then reduce CO 2 into CH 4 .By such a vectorial electron transport manner, the photoexcited electron-holes in the heterostructured composite were spatially separated efficiently, resulting in an enhanced photocatalytic activity of g-C 3 N 4 / KNbO 3 .In addition, the composition amount in the composite usually plays an important role in determining the photocatalytic activity.As shown in Fig. S3, all the g-C 3 N 4 /KNbO 3 composite samples exhibited higher CH 4 evolution amounts than pure g-C 3 N 4 .It was noted that the KNbO 3 content inuenced the photocatalytic activities of the composites asprepared materials notably.With an increase of KNbO 3 concentration from 15 to 25, the photocatalytic activity increased and exhibited a CH 4 production yield of 1.94 mmol, which was more than four times higher than that of pure g-C 3 N 4 .However, excessive deposition of KNbO 3 possibly led to shielding the g-C 3 N 4 surfaces, and subsequently decreased the photocatalytic activity. 51,55n order to verify the above-proposed mechanism, photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy measurements were performed to analysis the process of charge carrier trapping and transfer.It is widely recognized that the lower uorescence intensity means less recombination of photoinduced electron-hole pairs, leading to a higher photocatalytic activity. 78As a reference, g-C 3 N 4 and KNbO 3 with the same weight ratio as g-C 3 N 4 /KNbO 3 were also physically mixed.It was seen from Fig. S4 that pure g-C 3 N 4 excited at 350 nm displayed a main emission peak at 460 nm, which originated from the band-band PL process of self-trapped excitations. 79The emission intensity of physically mixed g-C 3 N 4 -KNbO 3 was lower than that of pure g-C 3 N 4 at a similar emission position, which could be primarily attributed to the decrease of g-C 3 N 4 concentration. 51As for g-C 3 N 4 /KNbO 3 composite, the emission intensity displayed an obvious decrease, suggesting that the recombination rate of carriers in the composite decreased due to photogenerated carrier transfer between g-C 3 N 4 and KNbO 3 , which was similar to the previous reports. 51,80All these suggest some meaningful information to design an effective photocatalysts for CO 2 reduction."}], "reactor type": [{"llm generation": "Fixed-bed", "source": "In the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 , the photocatalyst (100 mg) was uniformly and evenly spread on the bottom of a small glass cell that was placed in the bottom of a Pyrex glass cell, which was attached with a gaseous closed system.", "context": "All chemical reagents were analytical pure and used as received without further purication.KNbO 3 were synthesized through a hydrothermal treatment method.In a typical case, 0.3 g Nb 2 O 5 and 14 g KOH were dissolved in 25 mL deionized H 2 O.
