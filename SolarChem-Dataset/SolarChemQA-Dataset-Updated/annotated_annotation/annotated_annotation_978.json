Firstly, the bulk phase material g-C 3 N 4 was cut into CN small pieces by hydrothermal reaction.57 Secondly, after the freeze-drying process, the obtained powder of CN small pieces was re-dispersed in toluene or CH 2 Cl 2 solvent.Finally, CABB nanoparticles were added into the above solution and then the CABBC 3 N 4 composites were re-assembled in a tube furnace at 200 C under N 2 protection.Briefly, the two types of samples were denoted as CABBC 3 N 4 -10 and CABBC 3 N 4 -82 according to the surface coverage of g-C 3 N 4 on CABB (Fig. S6). The scanning elctronic microscopy (SEM) image of the as-prepared CABB, CABBC 3 N 4 -10 and CABBC 3 N 4 -82 particles are shown in Fig. 1a and Fig. S3.It can be seen that the surface of the samples becomes rough, implying the successful loading of g-C 3 N 4 .Fig. S4 shows the representative energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) elemental mapping results of CABBC 3 N 4 -10 , CABBC 3 N 4 -82 and CABB, further conforming the successful loading of g-C 3 N 4 .The transmission electron microscope (TEM) characterization as shown in Fig. 1b reveals that the g-C 3 N 4 loaded particles possesses a thin shell with a thickness of about 2-3 nm.The HRTEM image in Fig. S2 exhibited that the CABBC 3 N 4 sample has clear lattice spacing fringes of 5.609 nm, 3.244 nm and 2.296 nm, corresponding to (002), ( 222) and (224) planes of cubic CABB, respectively, indicating the highly crystalline double perovskite structure nature of the CABB.The amorphous layer is g-C 3 N 4 with a thickness of about 2.5 nm.From the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns in Fig. 1c, we found that all of identical peaks of the CABBC 3 N 4 -10 and CABBC 3 N 4 -82 samples can be well matched with a cubic double perovskite structure.The existence of g-C 3 N 4 in the composites is further confirmed by subsequent FT-IR, Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterization.As shown in Fig. 1d, the peaks in the spectrum of CABB are assigned to the surface adsorbed ligands during the anti-solvent synthetic process, supported by the literature.48 Notably, the multiple peaks in the range of 1200 to1700 cm -1 and the peaks at the 810 cm -1 can be assigned to the typical stretching vibration and the bending vibration of CN heterocycles respectively, which are well consistent with the characteristic peaks of the bulk g-C 3 N 4 .Typical characteristic peaks of CABB at 176 cm -1 and 351 cm -1 indicate that a higher energy phonon mode is involved in the absorption, in agreement with the previous literature(Fig.S7).58 Meanwhile, the obviously shifts of two peaks at 176 cm -1 and 351 cm -1 in the CABBC 3 N 4 -10 and CABBC 3 N 4 -82 samples might be attributed to the interaction at the interface between CABB and g-C 3 N 4 (Fig. S7).In the XPS data (Fig. 1e andf), the g-C 3 N 4 loaded samples show the apparent C and N species on the surface of the CABB nanoparticles.Accordingly, the peaks of C species at 284.8 eV and 288.3 eV in the C 1s spectrum can be attributed to adventitious hydrocarbon and C species of NCNe coordination in triazine rings, respectively.The N 1s spectrum also demonstrates the existence of CN-Scheme 1. Schematic pathway for the fabrication of both lead-free perovskite CABBC 3 N 4 -82 Z-scheme system and CABBg-C 3 N 4 -10 type-II heterojunction.S8, all of the Cs 3d, Ag 3d, Bi 4f and Br 3d XPS spectra display shifts toward lower binding energies after the CABB surface was decorated with g-C 3 N 4 , the trends of which are similar to the case in the reports.596061 In addition, the large shifts of the above peaks imply the modification of the electric properties on the surface of both the g-C 3 N 4 and the CABB. The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activities of the photocatalysts have been evaluated in an ethyl acetate solvent system coupled with methanol as sacrificial agent under AM 1.5 G simulate solar irradiation.Fig. 2 displays the photocatalytic CO 2 conversion performance of four kinds of the photocatalysts.Similar to the previous literatures 39, two electron CO reduction processes are more likely to occur on CABB owing to their insufficient reduction potential, in contrast to eightelectron CH 4 production pathway for pure g-C 3 N 4 .After loading of g-C 3 N 4 on CABB, the composited photocatalysts exhibit superior CO 2 reduction activity, giving the production rate of above 2.0 mol g -1 h -1 , which is 16-fold and 10-fold higher than that of pure CABB and pure g-C 3 N 4 , respectively.In this process, large quantities of CH 4 are produced as we expected.Specially, the CH 4 selectivity of CO 2 conversion is over 70 for the CABBC 3 N 4 -82 sample.Besides, no detectable high chain hydrocarbons product or hydrogen is generated in the reaction system as determined by GC.Furthermore, control experiments indicate that no CO or CH 4 was detected under the condition of either Ar atmosphere or in the absence of catalysts and methanol.In addition, the 13C labeled isotope detecting tests reveal that the obtained carbon products originate from CO 2 rather than the decomposition of g-C 3 N 4 or any other impurities during the synthetic process (Fig. S10). To investigate the photocatalytic mechanism, we studied the optical absorption, CO 2 photoreduction by monochromatic beams, surface photovoltage, photoluminescence, the in-situ irradiated XPS analysis and transient photocurrent properties of the photocatalysts.As shown in Fig. 3a, the absorption edge of the CABBC 3 N 4 -82 photocatalyst gives an apparent redshift compared with pure CABB and g-C 3 N 4 .Furthermore, we found that the evolved rates of CH 4 products of the CABBC 3 N 4 -82 photocatalyst, measured at 435, 475 and 550 nm monochromatic beam, are well-match with the light absorption curve of pure g-C 3 N 4 .The CH 4 products generated only when the g-C 3 N 4 was excited, which suggested the Z-scheme pathway.Meanwhile, for the CABBC 3 N 4 -10 sample, the evolved rates of CO products at monochromatic beam are in accord with the absorption curve of pure CABB (Fig. S11).It is clear that the CO production process occurs on the surface of the CABB and the sharp increase of the evolved rate with a decrease of the wavelength may be related to the heterojunction interface between the g-C 3 N 4 and the CABB.This threshold wavelength is closely related to electronic transition in semiconductor with wellmatched band structure.626364 The surface coverage of g-C 3 N 4 on CABB is an important factor for the surface properties of the composited photocatalysts.As we mentioned above, the adsorption experiments of RhB have been revealed the difference of the surface coverage of g-C 3 N 4 between two types of the composites (Fig. S6).Fig. 3b displays the surface photovoltage (SPV) spectra of g-C 3 N 4 , CABB, CABBC 3 N 4 -10 and CABBC 3 N 4 -82 .Pure CABB and g-C 3 N 4 exhibits a large negative signal and a weak positive signal of SPV, respectively.In the case of CABBC 3 N 4 -10 , the photogenerated electron transfers from g-C 3 N 4 to CABB due to the formation of a type II heterojunction; thus, the SPS signal is negative, which is similar to the signal of CABB.A weak light adsorption from g-C 3 N 4 (positive signal) and strong light absorption from CABB (negative signal) lead to the decreased signal of CABB.In the case of CABBC 3 N 4 -82 , the formation of Z-scheme species results in more electrons being kept at the g-C 3 N 4 ; thus, the SPS signal turns positive compared with type II heterojunction, which is similar to the case for pure g-C 3 N 4 .The trends of two type heterojunctions are well consistent with previous literature.65 Additionally, for the CABBC 3 N 4 -10 and CABBC 3 N 4 -82 samples, the intensity of the SPV signal decreases with the increase of the surface coverage of g-C 3 N 4 (Fig. 3b), which means that it is possible to modify the surface photoelectric properties of the composited photocatalysts by the surface coverage of the g-C 3 N 4 .The in-situ irradiated XPS analysis (Fig. S12) was used to further verify the Z-scheme mechanism.In the case of CABBC 3 N 4 -82 , there were slight positive shifts (by 0.1 eV) of the Cs3d and Ag3d bingding energy, suggesting decreases in their electron density under light irradiation.Meanwhile, the peak attributed to N1 s had a negative shift (by -0.7 eV), suggesting an increase in the electron density on the g-C 3 N 4 .The binding energy shifts suggested the electrons on the conduction band of CABB transfered to the valence band of g-C 3 N 4 , which provided direct evidence of the Z-scheme mechanism, agreed with previous literature.66 The opposite trend of the binding energy shifts provide direct evidence of the type-II mechanism for CABBC 3 N 4 -10 .Moreover, photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy was used to explore the separation and the recombination properties of the photogenerated charges, as shown in Fig. 3c.It can be seen that pure g-C 3 N 4 and CABB presents a broad PL emission at a peak of 515 nm and 640 nm, respectively, and the PL emission of intrinsic g-C 3 N 4 is disappeared in the CABBC 3 N 4 -10 and CABBC 3 N 4 -82 samples, which may be attributed to the large suppression of the recombination of the photogenerated carriers on g-C 3 N 4 by a highly efficient charge separation of the heterojunction interface.Similarly, a large decrease of the PL intensity at a peak of 645 nm in the CABBC 3 N 4 -10 sample further demonstrates the formation of the heterojunction between CABB and g-C 3 N 4 .However, it is unclear that no obvious decrease of the PL intensity was observed on the CABBC 3 N 4 -82 sample.Finally, transient photocurrent tests show that the CABBC 3 N 4 -10 and CABBC 3 N 4 -82 photocatalysts give a significant enhancement of photocurrent density compared to the pure CABB and the pure g-C 3 N 4 (Fig. 3d), also confirming the higher charge separation efficiency.Interestingly, the intensity of photocurrent in CABBC 3 N 4 -10 is about 2 times higher compared with that in CABBC 3 N 4 -82 . Based on the above discussions, the mechanism of charge carrier migration in the CABBC 3 N 4 -10 type-II system and the CABBC 3 N 4 -82 Z-scheme system are proposed in Fig. 3e.In the CABBC 3 N 4 -10 type-II system, the free electrons in conduction band of g-C 3 N 4 transfer to the conduction band of CABB, leading to high selective conversion CO 2 into CO, and meanwhile, g-C 3 N 4 is used as a hole collector to oxidative methanol to formaldehyde.67 The heterojunction between CABB and g-C 3 N 4 inhibits the recombination of the photogenerated charge, which significant enhance the activity of photocatalytical CO 2 reduction reaction.In the CABBC 3 N 4 -82 Zscheme system, electrons from CABB will recombine with holes from g-C 3 N 4 , remaining the electrons on the conduction band of g-C 3 N 4 and the holes on the valence band of CABB, respectively.This typical Zscheme system heterojunction enhances both the oxidative and the reductive ability.Hence, photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction occurred in the conduction band of g-C 3 N 4 resulting high selective conversion CO 2 into CH 4 .Indeed, as shown in Fig. 3d, the recombination of the electrons from CABB with the holes from g-C 3 N 4 would result in the large decrease of the photogenerated carriers compared with the type-II heterojunction system. Cycling experiments of the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction using the CABBC 3 N 4 -10 with lower the surface coverage of g-C 3 N 4 were carried out to test the stability of photocatalysts (shown in Fig. 4a).No obvious decline of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance is observed after 12 h recycle of reaction.In addition, the XRD pattern of CABBC 3 N 4 -10 has not changed after 12 h recycle photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction, demonstrating the stability of photocatalysts.It can be seen from Fig. S13, the CABBC 3 N 4 -10 nanocomposite starts losing weight when the heating temperature is higher than 450C and the annealing of the CABBC 3 N 4 -10 at 300 C for 4 h does not deteriorate the performance of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, which clearly indicates the robustness of the CABBC 3 N 4 -10 photocatalysts.In our previous work, 46 the CABB started to dissolve in ethanol solvent system when the photocatalysts underwent five cycles of photocatalysis for RhB degradation.Here, the g-C 3 N 4 was insitu re-assembled on the surface of CABB nanoparticles to construct uniformly CABBC 3 N 4 core-shell photocatalysts.The above results demonstrate that the fabrication of core-shell structure is an extremely promising approach for improving stability of photocatalysts."}], "lamp": [{"llm generation": "Xenon", "source": "The irradiation was conducted with a xenon lamp equipped to simulate the solar light illumination and the light intensity was adjusted to 150 mW cm -2 and the single-wavelength activity experiments were performed with a xenon lamp (light intensity of 80 mW cm -2 ) under monochromatic beams (435475 and 550 nm).", "context": "Dicyandiamide was purchased from Beijing Chemical Reagent Corp., PR China.CsBr was obtained from Shanghai Aladdin Biochem technology Co., Ltd.BiBr 3 was obtained from Strem Chemicals Inc.

Firstly, the bulk phase material g-C 3 N 4 was cut into CN small pieces by hydrothermal reaction.57 Secondly, after the freeze-drying process, the obtained powder of CN small pieces was re-dispersed in toluene or CH 2 Cl 2 solvent.Finally, CABB nanoparticles were added into the above solution and then the CABBC 3 N 4 composites were re-assembled in a tube furnace at 200 C under N 2 protection.Briefly, the two types of samples were denoted as CABBC 3 N 4 -10 and CABBC 3 N 4 -82 according to the surface coverage of g-C 3 N 4 on CABB (Fig. S6). The scanning elctronic microscopy (SEM) image of the as-prepared CABB, CABBC 3 N 4 -10 and CABBC 3 N 4 -82 particles are shown in Fig. 1a and Fig. S3.It can be seen that the surface of the samples becomes rough, implying the successful loading of g-C 3 N 4 .Fig. S4 shows the representative energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) elemental mapping results of CABBC 3 N 4 -10 , CABBC 3 N 4 -82 and CABB, further conforming the successful loading of g-C 3 N 4 .The transmission electron microscope (TEM) characterization as shown in Fig. 1b reveals that the g-C 3 N 4 loaded particles possesses a thin shell with a thickness of about 2-3 nm.The HRTEM image in Fig. S2 exhibited that the CABBC 3 N 4 sample has clear lattice spacing fringes of 5.609 nm, 3.244 nm and 2.296 nm, corresponding to (002), ( 222) and (224) planes of cubic CABB, respectively, indicating the highly crystalline double perovskite structure nature of the CABB.The amorphous layer is g-C 3 N 4 with a thickness of about 2.5 nm.From the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns in Fig. 1c, we found that all of identical peaks of the CABBC 3 N 4 -10 and CABBC 3 N 4 -82 samples can be well matched with a cubic double perovskite structure.The existence of g-C 3 N 4 in the composites is further confirmed by subsequent FT-IR, Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterization.As shown in Fig. 1d, the peaks in the spectrum of CABB are assigned to the surface adsorbed ligands during the anti-solvent synthetic process, supported by the literature.48 Notably, the multiple peaks in the range of 1200 to1700 cm -1 and the peaks at the 810 cm -1 can be assigned to the typical stretching vibration and the bending vibration of CN heterocycles respectively, which are well consistent with the characteristic peaks of the bulk g-C 3 N 4 .Typical characteristic peaks of CABB at 176 cm -1 and 351 cm -1 indicate that a higher energy phonon mode is involved in the absorption, in agreement with the previous literature(Fig.S7).58 Meanwhile, the obviously shifts of two peaks at 176 cm -1 and 351 cm -1 in the CABBC 3 N 4 -10 and CABBC 3 N 4 -82 samples might be attributed to the interaction at the interface between CABB and g-C 3 N 4 (Fig. S7).In the XPS data (Fig. 1e andf), the g-C 3 N 4 loaded samples show the apparent C and N species on the surface of the CABB nanoparticles.Accordingly, the peaks of C species at 284.8 eV and 288.3 eV in the C 1s spectrum can be attributed to adventitious hydrocarbon and C species of NCNe coordination in triazine rings, respectively.The N 1s spectrum also demonstrates the existence of CN-Scheme 1. Schematic pathway for the fabrication of both lead-free perovskite CABBC 3 N 4 -82 Z-scheme system and CABBg-C 3 N 4 -10 type-II heterojunction.S8, all of the Cs 3d, Ag 3d, Bi 4f and Br 3d XPS spectra display shifts toward lower binding energies after the CABB surface was decorated with g-C 3 N 4 , the trends of which are similar to the case in the reports.596061 In addition, the large shifts of the above peaks imply the modification of the electric properties on the surface of both the g-C 3 N 4 and the CABB. The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activities of the photocatalysts have been evaluated in an ethyl acetate solvent system coupled with methanol as sacrificial agent under AM 1.5 G simulate solar irradiation.Fig. 2 displays the photocatalytic CO 2 conversion performance of four kinds of the photocatalysts.Similar to the previous literatures 39, two electron CO reduction processes are more likely to occur on CABB owing to their insufficient reduction potential, in contrast to eightelectron CH 4 production pathway for pure g-C 3 N 4 .After loading of g-C 3 N 4 on CABB, the composited photocatalysts exhibit superior CO 2 reduction activity, giving the production rate of above 2.0 mol g -1 h -1 , which is 16-fold and 10-fold higher than that of pure CABB and pure g-C 3 N 4 , respectively.In this process, large quantities of CH 4 are produced as we expected.Specially, the CH 4 selectivity of CO 2 conversion is over 70 for the CABBC 3 N 4 -82 sample.Besides, no detectable high chain hydrocarbons product or hydrogen is generated in the reaction system as determined by GC.Furthermore, control experiments indicate that no CO or CH 4 was detected under the condition of either Ar atmosphere or in the absence of catalysts and methanol.In addition, the 13C labeled isotope detecting tests reveal that the obtained carbon products originate from CO 2 rather than the decomposition of g-C 3 N 4 or any other impurities during the synthetic process (Fig. S10). To investigate the photocatalytic mechanism, we studied the optical absorption, CO 2 photoreduction by monochromatic beams, surface photovoltage, photoluminescence, the in-situ irradiated XPS analysis and transient photocurrent properties of the photocatalysts.As shown in Fig. 3a, the absorption edge of the CABBC 3 N 4 -82 photocatalyst gives an apparent redshift compared with pure CABB and g-C 3 N 4 .Furthermore, we found that the evolved rates of CH 4 products of the CABBC 3 N 4 -82 photocatalyst, measured at 435, 475 and 550 nm monochromatic beam, are well-match with the light absorption curve of pure g-C 3 N 4 .The CH 4 products generated only when the g-C 3 N 4 was excited, which suggested the Z-scheme pathway.Meanwhile, for the CABBC 3 N 4 -10 sample, the evolved rates of CO products at monochromatic beam are in accord with the absorption curve of pure CABB (Fig. S11).It is clear that the CO production process occurs on the surface of the CABB and the sharp increase of the evolved rate with a decrease of the wavelength may be related to the heterojunction interface between the g-C 3 N 4 and the CABB.This threshold wavelength is closely related to electronic transition in semiconductor with wellmatched band structure.626364 The surface coverage of g-C 3 N 4 on CABB is an important factor for the surface properties of the composited photocatalysts.As we mentioned above, the adsorption experiments of RhB have been revealed the difference of the surface coverage of g-C 3 N 4 between two types of the composites (Fig. S6).Fig. 3b displays the surface photovoltage (SPV) spectra of g-C 3 N 4 , CABB, CABBC 3 N 4 -10 and CABBC 3 N 4 -82 .Pure CABB and g-C 3 N 4 exhibits a large negative signal and a weak positive signal of SPV, respectively.In the case of CABBC 3 N 4 -10 , the photogenerated electron transfers from g-C 3 N 4 to CABB due to the formation of a type II heterojunction; thus, the SPS signal is negative, which is similar to the signal of CABB.A weak light adsorption from g-C 3 N 4 (positive signal) and strong light absorption from CABB (negative signal) lead to the decreased signal of CABB.In the case of CABBC 3 N 4 -82 , the formation of Z-scheme species results in more electrons being kept at the g-C 3 N 4 ; thus, the SPS signal turns positive compared with type II heterojunction, which is similar to the case for pure g-C 3 N 4 .The trends of two type heterojunctions are well consistent with previous literature.65 Additionally, for the CABBC 3 N 4 -10 and CABBC 3 N 4 -82 samples, the intensity of the SPV signal decreases with the increase of the surface coverage of g-C 3 N 4 (Fig. 3b), which means that it is possible to modify the surface photoelectric properties of the composited photocatalysts by the surface coverage of the g-C 3 N 4 .The in-situ irradiated XPS analysis (Fig. S12) was used to further verify the Z-scheme mechanism.In the case of CABBC 3 N 4 -82 , there were slight positive shifts (by 0.1 eV) of the Cs3d and Ag3d bingding energy, suggesting decreases in their electron density under light irradiation.Meanwhile, the peak attributed to N1 s had a negative shift (by -0.7 eV), suggesting an increase in the electron density on the g-C 3 N 4 .The binding energy shifts suggested the electrons on the conduction band of CABB transfered to the valence band of g-C 3 N 4 , which provided direct evidence of the Z-scheme mechanism, agreed with previous literature.66 The opposite trend of the binding energy shifts provide direct evidence of the type-II mechanism for CABBC 3 N 4 -10 .Moreover, photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy was used to explore the separation and the recombination properties of the photogenerated charges, as shown in Fig. 3c.It can be seen that pure g-C 3 N 4 and CABB presents a broad PL emission at a peak of 515 nm and 640 nm, respectively, and the PL emission of intrinsic g-C 3 N 4 is disappeared in the CABBC 3 N 4 -10 and CABBC 3 N 4 -82 samples, which may be attributed to the large suppression of the recombination of the photogenerated carriers on g-C 3 N 4 by a highly efficient charge separation of the heterojunction interface.Similarly, a large decrease of the PL intensity at a peak of 645 nm in the CABBC 3 N 4 -10 sample further demonstrates the formation of the heterojunction between CABB and g-C 3 N 4 .However, it is unclear that no obvious decrease of the PL intensity was observed on the CABBC 3 N 4 -82 sample.Finally, transient photocurrent tests show that the CABBC 3 N 4 -10 and CABBC 3 N 4 -82 photocatalysts give a significant enhancement of photocurrent density compared to the pure CABB and the pure g-C 3 N 4 (Fig. 3d), also confirming the higher charge separation efficiency.Interestingly, the intensity of photocurrent in CABBC 3 N 4 -10 is about 2 times higher compared with that in CABBC 3 N 4 -82 . Based on the above discussions, the mechanism of charge carrier migration in the CABBC 3 N 4 -10 type-II system and the CABBC 3 N 4 -82 Z-scheme system are proposed in Fig. 3e.In the CABBC 3 N 4 -10 type-II system, the free electrons in conduction band of g-C 3 N 4 transfer to the conduction band of CABB, leading to high selective conversion CO 2 into CO, and meanwhile, g-C 3 N 4 is used as a hole collector to oxidative methanol to formaldehyde.67 The heterojunction between CABB and g-C 3 N 4 inhibits the recombination of the photogenerated charge, which significant enhance the activity of photocatalytical CO 2 reduction reaction.In the CABBC 3 N 4 -82 Zscheme system, electrons from CABB will recombine with holes from g-C 3 N 4 , remaining the electrons on the conduction band of g-C 3 N 4 and the holes on the valence band of CABB, respectively.This typical Zscheme system heterojunction enhances both the oxidative and the reductive ability.Hence, photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction occurred in the conduction band of g-C 3 N 4 resulting high selective conversion CO 2 into CH 4 .Indeed, as shown in Fig. 3d, the recombination of the electrons from CABB with the holes from g-C 3 N 4 would result in the large decrease of the photogenerated carriers compared with the type-II heterojunction system. Cycling experiments of the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction using the CABBC 3 N 4 -10 with lower the surface coverage of g-C 3 N 4 were carried out to test the stability of photocatalysts (shown in Fig. 4a).No obvious decline of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance is observed after 12 h recycle of reaction.In addition, the XRD pattern of CABBC 3 N 4 -10 has not changed after 12 h recycle photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction, demonstrating the stability of photocatalysts.It can be seen from Fig. S13, the CABBC 3 N 4 -10 nanocomposite starts losing weight when the heating temperature is higher than 450C and the annealing of the CABBC 3 N 4 -10 at 300 C for 4 h does not deteriorate the performance of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, which clearly indicates the robustness of the CABBC 3 N 4 -10 photocatalysts.In our previous work, 46 the CABB started to dissolve in ethanol solvent system when the photocatalysts underwent five cycles of photocatalysis for RhB degradation.Here, the g-C 3 N 4 was insitu re-assembled on the surface of CABB nanoparticles to construct uniformly CABBC 3 N 4 core-shell photocatalysts.The above results demonstrate that the fabrication of core-shell structure is an extremely promising approach for improving stability of photocatalysts."}, {"llm generation": "Liquid", "source": "The CABBC 3 N 4 core-shell system using polar Fig. 3.
