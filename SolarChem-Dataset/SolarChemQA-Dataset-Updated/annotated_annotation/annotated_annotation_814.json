The duplication of leaf surface on CS films was conducted by previously reported technique (Tseng, Kang et al., 2019).Adequate amounts of the two components of PDMS solution were well-mixed and cast on the glass substrate attached with fresh leaves of Xanthosoma sagittifolium.After degassing and curing at 70 C for 1.5 h, the detached PDMS negative template was ready for the fabrication of biomimetic CS films.On the other hand, a solution of CS was prepared by dissolving 1 g of CS powders in the mixture of deionized water (49 mL) and acetic acid (1 mL).For designated samples, the crosslinking agent GA, 0.1 g, was then mixed with the above clear CS solution for 3 h at room temperature.The de-bubbled CS or CS-GA solution was cast on glass substrate or PDMS negative template, followed by drying at room temperature for 3 days.The obtained films were ready for the grafting of TiO 2 . Equimolar (0.01 mol) TBOT and HAc were gradually introduced to a flask containing 50 mL of BuOH under stirring for 1 h.TBOT was then hydrolyzed by stoichiometric amounts of slowly released water from esterification of HAc and BuOH (Tseng, Kang et al., 2019).The obtained CS films with fixed area (4 cm x 2 cm) were immersed into the precursor solution, where the hydroxyl groups could react with the amine groups on CS, to anchor titania nanoparticles (Hamden et al., 2016).The immersion time was tuned and followed by thermal treating at 150 C for 1 h.The sample code was denoted CS-G-L-Ti-x, where G indicates the addition of crosslinking reagent GA, L represents the presence of leaf structure, Ti means the grafting with TiO 2 nanoparticles and x represents the immersion time in TiO 2 precursor solution, ranging from 5 to 60 min..For comparison, the reference sample, CS-G-L-P25, was prepared by immersion CSeGeL film in P25/BuOH suspension (concentration: 1 g/L) for 5 min and followed by the same thermal treating procedure. The functional groups of films were determined from their infrared spectra recorded by a Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer (Jasco FT/IR-4600) equipped with an attenuated total reflection (ATR, Jasco Pro One) accessory.The interested film surface was in contact with the ZnSe crystal under the pressure of 400 kg/cm 2 .The crystallinity of samples was identified by an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Bruker D8 SSS) using Cu K radiation ( 0.154178 nm) at 40 kV and 35 mA.The UV-vis spectra of samples were acquired on a spectrophotometer (Jasco V-650) to reveal the optical absorption of films and confirm the presence of TiO 2 .The morphology of films was observed via a scanning electron microscope (SEM, JEOL JSM-7401 F) integrated with an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS, OXFORD X-MAX).The chemical composition of each film was investigated by an X-ray photoelectron spectroscope (XPS, ULVAC-PHI PHI5000 VersaProbe) using Al K radiation.The depth-profiling was performed using Ar ions with an average etching rate of 14 nm/min.The contact angle of each film presented in this work was an average of the contact angles from five droplets at different locations on each film.The contact angle of water droplets on films was measured using a goniometer (DSA10-MK2) equipped with a camera to capture images of water droplets on the films at room temperature.Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out with a TGA-Q500 from TA Instrument at a heating rate of 20 C/min under air to evaluate the thermal stability of films and estimate the loadings of TiO 2 within films.Thermal programmed desorption (TPD) measurements were achieved using ultrapure CO 2 and helium (He).A dry film sample with a fixed weight of 0.05 g was introduced into a U-shaped quartz reactor and purged with He (30 mL/ min) at room temperature for 10 min, then switched to CO 2 for another 10 min until a stable baseline reached.The CO 2 desorption signal was recorded from 25 C to 300 C at a heating rate of 5 C/min by using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD, YL Instrument). The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 was conducted in a batch reactor at ambient temperature.The film sample with a fixed dimension of 2 cm x 4 cm was placed on the bottom of the stainless-steel cylindrical reactor with the volume of 100 cm 3 .A quartz window (3 cm in diameter) on the top of the reactor was designed for the illumination via a UV light bulb (main wavelength: 365 nm, 8 W).A UVX radiometer (ANALYTIKJENA) were connected to a UVA (365 nm) or UVC (254 nm) probe respectively to estimate UV intensity reaching the surface of sample in the reactor.The measured intensity from the UV light bulb was 2.25 mW/cm 2 of UVA combined with trace amount of UVC (193.5 W/cm 2 ).That is, the photons reached to the surface (8 cm 2 ) of a catalytic film were approximately at a rate of 5.825 10 -8 mol/s.The value was applied later to evaluate the quantum efficiency (QE).Before illumination, the reactor was carefully cleaned and placed in a vacuum oven at 40 C for 1 h to remove gaseous impurity from the reactor.High purity CO 2 (99.999 ) was then purged through a water bubbler at room temperature into the reactor at a flowrate of 70 mL/min for 30 min.The outlet and inlet of the reactor were then closed and ready for the photoreaction.A gas chromatography (YL Instrument, YL6500) equipped with a highly sensitive pulsed-discharge helium ionization detector (PDHID) was employed to analyze the products of photoreduction.Therefore, the carrier gas was He (purity: 99.999 ) Two separation columns from Ohio Valley Specialty, including Porapack N for the detection of H 2 , O 2 , CO and CH 4 , and Molecular Sieve 5A for CO 2 , H 2 O and other C1-C2 hydrocarbons, were connected in series to simultaneously analyze all possible products from one injection.The volume of each injection was 1 mL withdrawn from the photoreactor by a gas-tight syringe."}, {"llm generation": "UV", "source": "Fig. 10(a) and Fig. S5(a-c) depicted the times course of CO yield from each film under UV irradiation.", "context": "The SEM images of the top surface of a series of CS-L, CS-G-L, and CS-G-L-Ti-x films with different magnifications were displayed in Fig. 1.As shown in Fig. 1(a,b), most of the micro-scale papillae (height: 8-10 m) of Xanthosoma sagittifolium and cuticular foldings were successfully duplicated on CS-L or CS-G-L films via the in-house nanocasting process (Barthlott, Mail, Bhushan, Koch, 2017;Ensikat, Ditsche-Kuru, Neinhuis, Barthlott, 2011).However, comparing with previous replication on polyimide, some of the node-like micro-structures were not completely replicated on plain CS films without the addition of GA (Tseng, Kang et al., 2019).The relatively dense matrix of CS-G-L film (Fig. 1(c)) was revealed in comparing to CS-L (Fig. 1(b)).Same phenomenon was revealed from samples grafting with TiO 2 .As shown in supplemental image (Fig. S1), the CS-G-L series possessed denser CS matrix than CS-L series. The addition of GA also resulted in sharper cuticular foldings on CS-G-L films.The nanometer-scale sheet-like foldings inserted on the papillae of CS-G-L could be observed from the top surface or cross-sectional images (Fig. 1c, c, g).The surface morphologies of the CS-L-Ti-x or CS-G-L-Ti-x films were illustrated in Fig. 1(d,d,e,f).The corresponding EDS elemental mapping results from Fig. 1(f) were shown in Fig. 1(f, f).For 5-minute immersion in TiO 2 precursor solution, the Ti atoms were homogeneously dispersed on CS-L (not shown) or CS-G-L (Fig. 1f).The evidence of the formation of photoactive TiO 2 nanoparticles will discussed in the later section. As shown in Fig. 1(d), the mushroom-shape papillae were revealed after the immersion of CSeGeL films in TBOT for 60 min.However, a larger thickness of grafted TiO 2 film may lead to cracking or detaching from the CS films upon fracturing the film for SEM analysis.As shown in Fig. S1, some cracking of TiO 2 films occurred from those films with longer immersion time.That is, the stability or the durability of those composites films after bending was reduced.As shown in Fig. 1(g), the sharp folding on papillae remained on CS-G-L-P25-5 and the P25 clusters were favorably dispersed on the folding of biomimetic film after drying at room temperature.Notably, the arrows shown in Fig. 1 highlighted the presence of TiO 2 particles on films.As the amine and hydroxyl functional groups on CS would promote the chelating of TiO 2 precursors (TBOT), the growth of TiO 2 nanoparticles on CS occurred via the following hydrolysis and condensation reactions (Hamden et al., 2016).Therefore, the coverage of TiO 2 nanoparticles on CS were achieved in this work. The hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity of catalysts affects the amounts of adsorbed water and consequently influenced the following pathway of CO 2 reduction.By maintaining the same material composition (CSor CS-G-based films), the hydrophobicity of films was tuned by simply creating different patterns on the surface to study its effect on photoactivity.The hydrophobicity was evaluated by comparing the contact angles of water droplets on films.As shown in Fig. 2(a), the contact angle of water droplets on intrinsic CS film was around 95and then significantly increased upon the creation of hierarchical structure on CS as well as the addition of GA within CS.The value of contact angle on CS-L was 134, which is 1.41 times of the value of CS.The addition of crosslinker GA within CS or CS-L also slightly enhanced the hydrophobicity.The contact angles of water droplets on CS-G-L films were as high as 138.On the contrary, the surface hydrophobicity declined after grafting of TiO 2 particles. As shown in Fig. 2(b), considerable decrease in contact angle occurred upon grafting TiO 2 on CS-G-L or CS-L films by immersing in TiO 2 precursor solution for 5 min.A similar contact angle, around 102, was revealed from both CS-G-L-Ti-5 and CS-L-Ti-5 and then gradually dropped to 83for films after 60-min immersion.For flat CS or CS-G films, the decrease in contact angle was not as rapid biomimetic ones and the level-off in contact angle was observed.The saturated coverage of TiO 2 on flat CS films achieved after 15-min immersion.SEM images and the following TGA results also confirmed that prolonged immersion did not lead to more deposition of TiO 2 on films.The surface wettability of resultant films was not only controlled by the amounts of TiO 2 but, most importantly, the surface roughness.Under the same immersion time, the patterned CS films exhibited higher hydrophobicity than flat CS films.Notably, the reference film CS-G-L-P25 (contact angle 89.32.4) was more hydrophilic than CS-G-L-Ti-5, which has the same precursor immersion time of 5 min.After photocatalytic reaction (12 -h UVA irradiation), the contact angle of CS-G-L-P25 slightly decreased to 81.9 3.1, however, no significant change in contact angle of CS-G-L-Ti-x was observed. Fig. 3 plots the changes in mass of films as a function of temperature in the atmosphere of air.The flat biomimetic films, both CS-L and CS-G-L, exhibited nearly identical TGA curves except the slight difference at the final weight-loss stage.Three weight-loss stages were appeared from all CS-based films and the results are consistent to literature reports (Wang et al., 2005).The water contents in each sample was estimated from the weight loss at the first stage, where the temperature increased up to 130 C (Hassan, Omer, Abbas, Baset, Tamer, 2018).For CS-L and CS-G-L films, the estimated water contents were 18.3 wt and 17.3 wt, respectively, as listed in Table 1.The addition of crosslinker slightly reduced the water contents of CS film.After grafting TiO 2 , the weight loss at the first stage reduced to 11.1 wt for CS-G-L-Ti-5 and 12.6 for CS-L-Ti-5.It has been noticed that BuOH can serve as a stabilizer to reduce the swelling of CS-based microcapsules in aqueous solution (Chatterjee, Salaun, Campagne, 2014).Therefore, the reduce in water contents of those TiO 2 -grafted CS films may result from more compact CS matrix after the immersion in BuOH-based precursor solution. As shown in Fig. 3 more weight loss than other biomimetic composite films or parent CS-G-L film at the first stage.The second stage of thermal degradation beginning from 200 C to 400 C was due to the degradation of pyranose rings on polymeric chains (Afzal et al., 2017;Zhu et al., 2012).The temperature at 50 wt weight loss was 300 C for bare CS-L or CS-G-L and increased to 358 C for CS-G-L-Ti-5 or 332 C for CS-G-L-Ti-60.TGA curves of amounts of grafted TiO 2 on films were estimated by comparing their residue mass from TGA curves.The residue mass of 5.3 wt from CS-G-L-Ti-5 was the highest among all films obtained in this work.Surprisingly to know that only 1.2 wt of TiO 2 in CS-G-L-Ti-15 film, which experienced longer immersion in precursor solution.Under the same precursor-immersion time of 15 min, less TiO 2 particles (1.2 wt) were grafted in CS-G-L-Ti-15 than in CS-L-Ti-15 (4.8 wt) due to the denser matrix of crosslinked CS matrix.Similar results were observed from the reference CS-L-P25 and CS-G-L-P25 films, where P25 contents were 0.4 wt and 0.1 wt, respectively.With the leaf-pattern on the surface, the amounts of grafted TiO 2 was significantly improved. Notably, the immersion time in TiO 2 precursor solution was irrelevant to the amount of TiO 2 on films as the compactness of CS matrix was also varied after immersion. Because samples produce very strong absorption by transmission mode, the ATR-FTIR technique was applied to collect FTIR spectra of films.As shown in Fig. 4, the absorption bands located from 3270 to 3450 cm -1 were attributed to hydroxyl and amino groups (Mucha, Ksiazek, Kaczmarek, 2015;Wang et al., 2015).The following peaks located at 1410-1370 cm -1 (C-H stretching), 1550 cm -1 (NeH stretching in amino groups), 1070 and 1024 cm -1 (C-O stretching in OH groups), 1150 cm -1 (C-O-C stretching in glycosidic linkage) and 895 cm - 1 (pyranose ring vibration) were the characteristic CS functionalities (Guerrero, Muxika, Zarandona, de la Caba, 2019;Lai, Li, Wang, 2010;Mucha et al., 2015;Schiffman Schauer, 2007).Notably, the presence of very weak CO absorption band at 1645 cm -1 from bare CS film suggested the high degree of deacetylation (Kianfar, Vitale, Dalle Vacche, Bongiovanni, 2019;Kumirska et al., 2010;Mucha et al., 2015;Sionkowska, 2006).With the addition of crosslinker GA, especially being accompanied with TiO 2 -grafting, the intensity of CO band increased and slightly shifted to 1641 cm -1 suggesting the formation of Michael-type adducts in crosslinked CS matrix (Schiffman Schauer, 2007).In addition, new peaks appeared at 1652 cm -1 and 1729 cm -1 , which are respectively attributed to CN and CO groups in crosslinked matrix between GA and CS (Hassan et al., 2018;Lai et al., 2010;Schiffman Schauer, 2007).The presence of GA in films also led to more significant methyl groups, 2861 to 2925 cm -1 .Notably, the peak intensity from biomimetic samples was significantly smaller than flat ones.ATR-FTIR is a surface-sensitive technique because the evanescent waves could be attenuated by the air layer in between the surface structures before reaching the detector (Vrancken et al., 2018).For some films grafted with TiO 2 , the absorption bands ranging from 700 to 500 cm -1 were attributed to Ti-OeTi stretching vibration modes from crystalline TiO 2 (Jiang et al., 2011;Zhang, Lv, Li, Wang, Li, 2010).However, the absorption peaks at 799 cm -1 from TieOeC vibrations were barely visible from a series of films, including CS-G-L-Ti-5, which has the highest char yield from TGA. Remarkably, the characteristic diffraction peaks of anatase or rutile crystallinity could not be observed from XRD patterns of a series of films (CS, CS-G, CS-G-L-Ti-5, and CS-G-L-P25) as shown in Fig. S2.As the lack of TiO 2 peaks could attribute to small quantity, amorphous or nanosized particles, the following XPS and UV-VIS analysis were utilized to further identify the status of TiO 2 on CS films as well as the interaction between TiO 2 and CS. The XPS spectra of films were exploded to elucidate the depth distribution of components within top layers of samples.XPS depth profiles of C, O, N, and Ti elements in CS-G-L-Ti-15 and CS-L-Ti-15 films, which have the same TBOT immersion time (15 min), were compared in Fig. 5.The atomic concentration of Ti in CS-L-Ti-15 was around 12 on top surface and gradually increased to 26 at the depth of 80 nm and levelled off.On the other hand, the concentration of Ti of CS-G-L-Ti-15 was barely 1.4 at the top-most surface and slightly increased to as much as 6 at deeper layers.The XPS result was consistent to TGA's, that is, the estimated TiO 2 content from CS-L-Ti-15 is higher than that from CS-G-L-Ti-15.The addition of crosslinking agent GA decreased the amounts of amine functional groups in CS films and consequently restricted the grafting of TiO 2 (Hamden et al., 2016).The significant difference in the grafted TiO 2 species simultaneously affected the depth profile of carbon and oxygen elements.For CS-G-L-Ti-15, the carbon concentration was more than 80 on the top surface and levelled off at 65 as the depth reached 80 nm.The oxygen concentration increased from 20 to 27 within 40 nm-depth and remained constant at inner layers.In contrast to CS-G-L-Ti-15 film, the oxygen concentration within CS-L-Ti-15 was 3 to 4-fold higher than carbon.Without the crosslinking CS matrix, the grafting of TiO 2 in CS-L-Ti-15 was more favorable that may lead to higher oxygen concentration throughout the film. It has been noticed that the top-most surface of both two films exhibited slightly different shapes of Ti2p spectra from inner layers (Fig. 6(a,b)).The deconvoluted XPS spectra of CS-G-L-Ti-15 and CS-L-Ti-15 in Ti2p regions at specific layers, 15 nm-depth and top-most surface, were plotted in Fig. 6(c,d) and (e, f), respectively.Both films revealed the characteristic TiO 2 doublets of Ti2p core electrons at the binding energy of 459.2 eV and 464.9 eV (Bharti, Kumar, Lee, Kumar, 2016;Hamden et al., 2016).Another weaker doublet at the lower binding energy of 457.4 eV and 463.2 eV was attributed to Ti 3 -O species (Alqarni et al., 2018;Bharti et al., 2016;Shoueir, Kandil, Elhosainy, El-Kemary, 2019).As shown in Fig. 6(c,d), both films at the depth deeper than 15 nm showed another Ti2p peak centered at 455.6 eV, which is corresponding to Ti-N species, as the result of the interaction between amine groups and TiO 2 (Djellabi et al., 2019;Mucha et al., 2015;Zhang, Yan, Mao, 2014).The presence of GA in CS-G-L-Ti-15 restricted the grafting of TiO 2 and consequently the amounts of TieN bonds in this film were less than in CS-L-Ti-15.Notably, as shown in Fig. 6 (e,f), the TieN bonds were not observed but primarily characteristic Ti-O signals of TiO 2 and minor Ti 3 species on the top-most surface of both CS-G-L-Ti-15 and CS-L-Ti-15 films. The depth profiles of XPS C1s spectra of both CS-G-L-Ti-15 and CS-L-Ti-15 films were plotted in Fig. 7 (a,b).The peak maximum of both films slightly shifted to higher binding energy, from 284.5 eV to 284.8 eV, with the increasing depth as more aliphatic carbon contamination remained on both films (Hamden et al., 2016).Therefore, the deconvoluted XPS spectra of two films in C1s regions at two specific layers, 15 nm-depth and top-most surface, were plotted in Fig. 7(c,d) and (e, f), respectively.Those peaks at 284.2 eV, 284.9 eV, and 286.1 eV were attributed to the CS functional groups CeC/C-H, C-O/C-N, and C-O-C, respectively (Borgohain, Prasad, Mandal, 2019;Hamden et al., 2016;Song et al., 2018).Figure S3 also displayed the deconvoluted C1s XPS spectra of two reference films, CSeGeL and CS, for comparison.The C1s core electrons with the binding energy of 282.5 eV from CS-L-Ti-15 were ascribed to the C-Ti bonds (Zhang et al., 2014).The higher contents of TiO 2 in CSeL matrix also conduced to more C-OeTi components featuring at a binding energy similar to C-OeC (286.1 eV) (Gebauer et al., 2014).Therefore, more intense peak at the binding energy of 286.1 eV appeared from the sample of CS-L-Ti-15.The presence of the peak located at 288.3 eV was correlated to the CN groups indicating the crosslinking matrix in CS-G-L-Ti-15 (Hamden et al., 2016;Song et al., 2018).Without the addition of GA, the CN groups were absent in CS-L-Ti-15.On the other hand, other two peaks located at 287.2 eV and 289.1 eV (or 288.4 eV) were deconvoluted from CS-L-Ti-15 suggesting the presence of CO and NeCO groups, respectively (Hamden et al., 2016;Zhang et al., 2014).Those carboxylate groups in CS matrix were originated from remained acetyl groups as evidenced in FTIR spectra.(c,d) CS-Ti-x, and (e, f) CS-G-L films ranging from (a, c, e) 4000 cm -1 to 2100 cm -1 and (b, d, f) 2100 cm -1 to 500 cm -1 .Ti-15.The fitted curves at the depth of 15 nm from both films were compared in Fig. 8(c) and (d).The characteristic Ti-O, CO and C-O species on this film were ascribed to the peaks with a binding energy of 529.0, 530.3 and 531.5 eV, respectively (Borgohain et al., 2019;Hamden et al., 2016;Liu Wang, 2014).The difference in the ratio of Ti 3 /Ti 4 and C-O/CO components between CS-G-L-Ti-15 and CS-L-Ti-15 attributed to slightly shift in those oxygen functionalities. UV-VIS spectra of flat and patterned CS films were plotted in Fig. 9(a) and (b), respectively.For bare CS films, the characteristic absorption band at 230 nm was attributed to the n- transition of amine free electrons (Hassan et al., 2018).With the addition of crosslinker, CSeG samples exhibited more intense absorption bands in the range of 265-300 nm, which is due to the new n- transition of CN groups (Hassan et al., 2018;Hu, Xin, Hu, Chan, He, 2013).It is also reported that the formation of carbonyl groups leads to the presence of absorption peak at 291 nm (Czechowska-Biskup, Rokita, Lotfy, Ulanski, Rosiak, 2005).As the samples may scatter visible lights due to the presence of surface texture, the UV-VIS spectra of films were collected in two ways, structure-side or flat-side facing incident lights.The spectra were compared in Fig. S4.In our case, the difference in UV-VIS spectra between two measurements of a film was negligible that the scattering of incident lights by the surface texture was ignored.Therefore, the non-zero baselines in visible light region from biomimetic CS films could be considered as more absorption of visible lights by surface hierarchical structures.On the other hand, the appearance of characteristic absorption band edge of TiO 2 confirmed the formation of TiO 2 particles.The red shift of the absorption edge from samples containing biomimetic patterns or crosslinking agent GA suggested enhanced absorption of visible lights.As anatase TiO 2 has favorable indirect transition (Ramos, Boratto, Li, Scalvi, 2017;Reyes-Coronado et al., 2008), the indirect bandgap of each film was estimated by Tauc plot and compared in Fig. 9(c).The estimated bandgap values of films were in the range of 2.5-3.0 eV, which are consistent to reported ones (Bharti et al., 2016;Lee, You, Park, 2012).The effect of TBOT immersion time on the bandgap of TiO 2 in CS-Ti-x films was negligible.However, the bandgap of TiO 2 changed with x value from other film series.Under 60-min immersion in precursor solution, three films showed the same bandgap, except CS-Ti-60.The films with leaf patterns, CS-L-Ti-x and CS-G-L-Ti-x, displayed similar trend in bandgap changes, which is increasing first and then slightly decreasing with the prolonged immersion in precursor solution.As the x value was irrelevant to TiO 2 contents estimated by TGA,Fig. 9(d) also presented the relationship between bandgap and TGA-estimated TiO 2 content.The trend of decrease in bandgap revealed from samples containing more TiO 2 .The amounts of TiO 2 in CS matrix may affect the size of TiO 2 particles and their interaction with CS, consequently influenced the bandgap values.In this work, we observed that the bandgap value of each film was not the major factor controlling its photoactivity. The PL spectra of a series of films recorded at room temperature were plotted in Fig. 9(e,f).Strong and broad PL with a maximum at 452 nm was emitted from pure CS films under the excitation wavelength of 350 nm.With the presence of crosslinking agent GA, the maximum of PL shifted to 503 nm.The new emitted PL bands peaking at 469 nm (2.64 eV), 403 nm (3.08 eV), and 548 nm (2.26 eV) were attributed to the electronic transitions from the crosslinked CS matrix containing CN groups (Hu et al., 2013;Song et al., 2018).Notably, the presence of surface pattern or TiO 2 decreased the PL strength, but broadened PL peaks were revealed from films containing crosslinker GA.As the increase in isolation extent of fluorophores promotes strong emission of PL (Hu et al., 2013), the quench in PL intensity suggested the improved interaction between CS matrix and TiO 2 .Those interactions were also proved from the formation of Ti-O-C or Ti-N bonds shown XPS results, and consequently restricted the agglomeration of TiO 2 particles.CS-G-L-Ti-15 emitted the lowest PL indicating superior capability to restrict charge-recombination. The conversion of gaseous CO 2 by each film was conducted in a batch reactor with the presence of water vapor.According to GC chromatogram, the reduction product was primarily CO and trace amount of methanol.Fig. 10(a) and Fig. S5(a-c) depicted the times course of CO yield from each film under UV irradiation.Basically, the CO yield increased with UV irradiation time.Accordingly, without the presence of films (Legend: No catalyst, Fig. S5a), the CO signal was not detectable confirming the purity of CO 2 feed.The enhance in the CO production was observed from samples grafting with TiO 2 .However, the grafted TiO 2 amounts, according to TGA results, were not linearly correlated to CO yield.Notably, the two films, CS-L-Ti-60 and CS-G-L-Ti-15, had almost identical TiO 2 content of 1.2 wt and exhibited the highest photoactivity among other films.These two films were selected to purge with inert gas (He), instead of CO 2 feed, to test the degree of self-degradation or solvent evolution under UV irradiation.Although Fig. 10(a) and S5(c) showed detectable CO signal from the illuminated CS-G-L-Ti-15 and CS-L-Ti-60 under He atmosphere, the production of CO from CS-G-L-Ti-15 was slower than that from CS-L-Ti-60.The results implied higher photoactivity and less impurity from CS-G-L-Ti-15 film.The 12 -h methanol yield from each film was shown in Fig. S6.The ranking of methanol yield was different from that of CO.The relatively hydrophilic CS-G-Ti-15 film exhibited the highest methanol yield of 0.368 nmol/g and followed by CS-G-L-Ti-15. In order to more objectively evaluate photoactivity of each film, the quantum efficiency (QE) of each sample was estimated.QE is defined as the total numbers of electrons required to convert reactants into products divided by the incident photons at designated illumination period.In this work, the required electrons to convert the reactant CO 2 into CO (2 electrons) and MeOH (6 electrons) were summarized and divided to the photons reached the surface of each film.Based on the readings from the radiometer, the rate of photons reached the surface (8 cm 2 ) of each catalytic film was 5.825 10 -8 mol/s.Therefore, after 12 -h illumination, the amount of incident photons was 2.516 10 -3 mol.Simultaneously, the utilized electrons to produce 0.845 mol of CO and 0.326 nmol of methanol per sheet of CS-G-L-Ti-15 film were 1.692 mol.Accordingly, the QE for CS-G-L-Ti-15 is 0.067 , which is the highest value in this work.As compared in Fig. 10(b), the QE value from films with biomimetic structures showed higher QE values than flat CS films.Those QE values were almost 100 times higher than our previous work (Tseng, Sung et al., 2019), where polyimide supported Cu 2 O films were prepared for the same reaction.From the previously mentioned works in literature (Perez-Obando et al., 2019;Zhu et al., 2012Zhu et al., , 2013)), CS-related photocatalysts were applied for decoloration that the utilized electron/photon numbers were lack for the calculation of QE.It is worthy to note that the QE values from those supported TiO 2 on CS-based films were also higher than TiO 2 -graphitic carbon nitride nanoparticles (0.01 ) (Tseng, Sung et al., 2019).Notably, the QE of CS-G-L-P25 was as high as 0.053 , which is similar to that of CS-G-L-Ti-60.However, the stability of CS-G-L-P25 was worse than the CS-G-L-Ti-15 as the bonding of P25 with CSeGeL matrix was weaken than in-situ grafted TiO 2 .We also noticed that, after photoreaction, the surface of CS-G-L-P25 become more hydrophilic than fresh film as previously mentioned in contact angle results.In contrast, the illuminated CS-G-L-Ti-15 film remained similar surface energy.The cycle test results of CS-G-L-Ti-15 were presented in Fig. 10(c).The film could continuously produce CO but slightly decay in CO yield after each run.At the third run, the 12 -h CO yield was around 85 of the yield at the first run.It has been observed that the surface erosion of TiO 2 -deposited CS films during UV irradiation (Perez-Obando et al., 2019), and the increase in water content in the chitosan structure also enhanced the damage of CS (Czechowska-Biskup et al., 2005;Szymanska Winnicka, 2015).Therefore, the slight damage of CS matrix may lead the chalking of TiO 2 particles and consequently the CO yield was restricted. In addition, the amounts of -OH and -NH 2 functional groups in CSbased catalysts have been noticed to influence the capacity of CO 2 adsorption (Afzal et al., 2017;Tamboli et al., 2016).The CO 2 desorption profiles were utilized to estimate the capability of CO Klepel Hunger, 2005;Mikhaylov, Nikitin, Glazkova, Kuznetsov, 2018).Comparing with the signal intensity from the desorption profiles, the crosslinked CSeG matrix restricted the adsorption of CO 2 that the released CO 2 amounts was less than CS film.On the other hand, the presence of leaf-patterns boosted CO 2 capture that more intense desorption signals were obtained from CSeGeL than from CSeG.As the presence of H 2 O may contribute to more CO 2 capture (Beltrao-Nunes et al., 2019), the most hydrophilic CS film showed most prominent desorption signals among other films.The weak desorption signal occurred at the temperature range of 150 C-200 C suggested the presence of medium basicity on CSeGeL (Beltrao-Nunes et al., 2019).Both CS and CSeG films exhibited a desorption peak at 281 C, which is higher than that from CSeGeL films (268 C).The desorption profiles at the temperature higher than 200 C were not only intrinsic to chemisorption of CO 2 but the contribution of thermal degradation of CS matrix.Those TPD results still implied the improved affinity to CO 2 by CS matrix."}, {"llm generation": "UV", "source": "The tunable hydrophobicity on photocatalysts balanced the surface basicity for CO 2 capture and selectively produced CO and MeOH under low-power UVA irradiation.", "context": "In this work, novel biomimetic CS-based films grafted with photoactive TiO 2 were successfully synthesized via energy-saving procedures.The tunable hydrophobicity on photocatalysts balanced the surface basicity for CO 2 capture and selectively produced CO and MeOH under low-power UVA irradiation.The distribution and amount of TiO 2 in CS films were significantly affected by the presence of crosslinking agent rather than by the precursor immersion period.An optimum TiO 2 content in CS films was essential for effective CO 2 conversion.According to TGA results, the TiO 2 content was 1.2 wt of CS-G-L-Ti-15, which exhibited the weakest PL and highest QE among other films.The bio-friendly and biomimetic photocatalytic film also demonstrated good stability for consecutive CO 2 photoreduction.

The duplication of leaf surface on CS films was conducted by previously reported technique (Tseng, Kang et al., 2019).Adequate amounts of the two components of PDMS solution were well-mixed and cast on the glass substrate attached with fresh leaves of Xanthosoma sagittifolium.After degassing and curing at 70 C for 1.5 h, the detached PDMS negative template was ready for the fabrication of biomimetic CS films.On the other hand, a solution of CS was prepared by dissolving 1 g of CS powders in the mixture of deionized water (49 mL) and acetic acid (1 mL).For designated samples, the crosslinking agent GA, 0.1 g, was then mixed with the above clear CS solution for 3 h at room temperature.The de-bubbled CS or CS-GA solution was cast on glass substrate or PDMS negative template, followed by drying at room temperature for 3 days.The obtained films were ready for the grafting of TiO 2 . Equimolar (0.01 mol) TBOT and HAc were gradually introduced to a flask containing 50 mL of BuOH under stirring for 1 h.TBOT was then hydrolyzed by stoichiometric amounts of slowly released water from esterification of HAc and BuOH (Tseng, Kang et al., 2019).The obtained CS films with fixed area (4 cm x 2 cm) were immersed into the precursor solution, where the hydroxyl groups could react with the amine groups on CS, to anchor titania nanoparticles (Hamden et al., 2016).The immersion time was tuned and followed by thermal treating at 150 C for 1 h.The sample code was denoted CS-G-L-Ti-x, where G indicates the addition of crosslinking reagent GA, L represents the presence of leaf structure, Ti means the grafting with TiO 2 nanoparticles and x represents the immersion time in TiO 2 precursor solution, ranging from 5 to 60 min..For comparison, the reference sample, CS-G-L-P25, was prepared by immersion CSeGeL film in P25/BuOH suspension (concentration: 1 g/L) for 5 min and followed by the same thermal treating procedure. The functional groups of films were determined from their infrared spectra recorded by a Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer (Jasco FT/IR-4600) equipped with an attenuated total reflection (ATR, Jasco Pro One) accessory.The interested film surface was in contact with the ZnSe crystal under the pressure of 400 kg/cm 2 .The crystallinity of samples was identified by an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Bruker D8 SSS) using Cu K radiation ( 0.154178 nm) at 40 kV and 35 mA.The UV-vis spectra of samples were acquired on a spectrophotometer (Jasco V-650) to reveal the optical absorption of films and confirm the presence of TiO 2 .The morphology of films was observed via a scanning electron microscope (SEM, JEOL JSM-7401 F) integrated with an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS, OXFORD X-MAX).The chemical composition of each film was investigated by an X-ray photoelectron spectroscope (XPS, ULVAC-PHI PHI5000 VersaProbe) using Al K radiation.The depth-profiling was performed using Ar ions with an average etching rate of 14 nm/min.The contact angle of each film presented in this work was an average of the contact angles from five droplets at different locations on each film.The contact angle of water droplets on films was measured using a goniometer (DSA10-MK2) equipped with a camera to capture images of water droplets on the films at room temperature.Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out with a TGA-Q500 from TA Instrument at a heating rate of 20 C/min under air to evaluate the thermal stability of films and estimate the loadings of TiO 2 within films.Thermal programmed desorption (TPD) measurements were achieved using ultrapure CO 2 and helium (He).A dry film sample with a fixed weight of 0.05 g was introduced into a U-shaped quartz reactor and purged with He (30 mL/ min) at room temperature for 10 min, then switched to CO 2 for another 10 min until a stable baseline reached.The CO 2 desorption signal was recorded from 25 C to 300 C at a heating rate of 5 C/min by using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD, YL Instrument). The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 was conducted in a batch reactor at ambient temperature.The film sample with a fixed dimension of 2 cm x 4 cm was placed on the bottom of the stainless-steel cylindrical reactor with the volume of 100 cm 3 .A quartz window (3 cm in diameter) on the top of the reactor was designed for the illumination via a UV light bulb (main wavelength: 365 nm, 8 W).A UVX radiometer (ANALYTIKJENA) were connected to a UVA (365 nm) or UVC (254 nm) probe respectively to estimate UV intensity reaching the surface of sample in the reactor.The measured intensity from the UV light bulb was 2.25 mW/cm 2 of UVA combined with trace amount of UVC (193.5 W/cm 2 ).That is, the photons reached to the surface (8 cm 2 ) of a catalytic film were approximately at a rate of 5.825 10 -8 mol/s.The value was applied later to evaluate the quantum efficiency (QE).Before illumination, the reactor was carefully cleaned and placed in a vacuum oven at 40 C for 1 h to remove gaseous impurity from the reactor.High purity CO 2 (99.999 ) was then purged through a water bubbler at room temperature into the reactor at a flowrate of 70 mL/min for 30 min.The outlet and inlet of the reactor were then closed and ready for the photoreaction.A gas chromatography (YL Instrument, YL6500) equipped with a highly sensitive pulsed-discharge helium ionization detector (PDHID) was employed to analyze the products of photoreduction.Therefore, the carrier gas was He (purity: 99.999 ) Two separation columns from Ohio Valley Specialty, including Porapack N for the detection of H 2 , O 2 , CO and CH 4 , and Molecular Sieve 5A for CO 2 , H 2 O and other C1-C2 hydrocarbons, were connected in series to simultaneously analyze all possible products from one injection.The volume of each injection was 1 mL withdrawn from the photoreactor by a gas-tight syringe."}], "reactor type": [], "operation mode": []}}
