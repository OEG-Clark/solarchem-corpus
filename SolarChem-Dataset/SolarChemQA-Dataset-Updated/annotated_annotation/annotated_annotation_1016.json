To further analyze the composition of the as-prepared sample, XRD and XPS analyses were used to make a qualitative analysis.XRD pattern of the CuO QDs/WO 3 NSs (the composites are denoted as CW) show the additional diffraction peaks at 39.3 , 53.1 and 72.3 compared to the single WO 3 (JCPDS no.41e0905) in Fig. 2a, which corresponds to the (200), (020) and (311) facets of CuO (JCPDS no.44e0706) respectively, indicating the CuO was loaded on the WO 3 successfully.Moreover, XRD patterns of the different CuO loading amounts all show weak CuO characteristic peaks, which indicates the small size and the high dispersity of CuO.XPS analyses were performed to further investigate elemental compositions and the interaction between WO 3 NSs and CuO QDs.As shown in the XPS spectra, the W 4f binding energies of pure WO 3 NSs are 35.9eV and 37.9 eV (Fig. 2b), while the W 4f binding energies of the CuO/WO 3 negative shift to 35.7 eV and 37.7 eV, respectively (No special specification all of the CuO/WO 3 in the following content point to 6CuO/WO 3 , and the named QDs and NSs are omitted).Based on the Cu 2 attraction to the W 4f surrounding electrons, CuO/WO 3 shows the smaller W 4f binding energies compared to the pure WO 3 , indicates the intimate built-in electric field interaction is formed at the compact interface of CuO/ WO 3 .In Fig. 2c, the O 1s peaks of CuO/WO 3 locate at 530.3 eV and 532.1 eV, and have a slight negatively shift compared to the pure WO 3 , which could be attributed to the strongly coupled heterointerfaces between CuO QDs and WO 3 NSs 28.Moreover, compared to the O1s of pure WO 3 , no signal of new oxygen species arisen in CuO/WO 3 , which indicates that no residual PVP surfactant 29.The XPS survey spectrum of Cu 2p (Fig. 2d) displays the dominant band energies at 932.5 eV and 952.5 eV, respectively, which are the typical Cu 2 characteristic of CuO 30.The presence of weak peaks located at 931.1 eV and 950.8 eV confirm the infinitesimal presence of Cu 31,32.The weak satellite peaks at 942.8 eV, and 945.9 eV correspond to Cu 2 , and attributed to the open 3 d 9 shell of Cu (II) 30,33.Meanwhile, the full scan survey XPS spectrum of the CuO/WO 3 heterostructure clearly shown the presence of Cu, O, and W elements (Figure S1).Owing to the different detection sensitivity and detection depth between XRD and XPS, the CuO QDs characteristic planes were successfully detected by XRD, and the Cu 2 was also clearly detected by the XPS, which implied that the small size and high dispersity CuO QDs were loaded on the WO 3 surface and the intimate heterojunctions formed between CuO QDs and WO 3 NSs. To evaluate the optical properties of as-prepared samples, UVevis DRS was carried out.As vividly shown in the UVevis DRS (Fig. 3a), pure WO 3 displays a visible-light absorption edge at approximate 525 nm, after combining with the narrow-bandgap semiconductors CuO, a slight red-shift is observed at the 550 nm absorption edge of CuO/WO 3 compared to the pure WO 3 , which indicates an enhanced visible-light harvesting ability of the composites and reveals a strong interaction from the CuO QDs/WO 3 NSs heterostructure.Based on the data of UVevis DRS, the Plot of (ahn) 1/2 vs. hn was also fitted to further evaluate the bandgap energies of the as-prepared samples, and the bandgap energies of WO 3 , CuO, and CuO/WO 3 are 2.34 eV, 1.31 eV, and 2.28 eV respectively, which also proves the coupling between WO 3 NSs and CuO QDs can enhance the visible-light absorption of WO 3 NSs and benefit to the photocatalytic process.To study the separation properties of photogenerated electrons and holes, the PL spectra of the WO 3 and CuO/WO 3 were examined.As shown in Fig. 3b, CuO/ WO 3 shows weaker steady-state PL emission peaks at 469 nm, indicating the lower photogenerated carrier recombination, which could be ascribed to the conjecture that the Z-scheme photocarriers transfer could promote the photogenerated carrier separation between WO 3 and CuO.To further verify the function of CuO/WO 3 heterojunction in the photogenerated carriers transfer process, the time-resolved fluorescence study was carried.As shown in Fig. 3c and Table S1, the fluorescent lifetime t of CuO/WO 3 is 18.7533 ns, which is much longer than WO 3 , further suggesting that the recombination of charge carriers over CuO/WO 3 have been restrained effectively 34e36.Furthermore, the detailed fluorescent lifetime t 2 of CuO/WO 3 is much longer than WO 3 , indicating a much lower direct recombination rate of photogenerated charge carriers in the composite, which further prove that the compact interface between CuO QDs and WO 3 NSs can benefit the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes. Meanwhile, the charge transfer properties are further revealed by a series of electrochemical measurements.The transient photocurrent response was applied to give the evidence about charge separation under visible-light irradiation, an enhanced photocurrent intensity of CuO/WO 3 could be recognized distinct from the pure WO 3 (Fig. 3d), which corresponds to a higher separation efficiency of photogenerated electron-hole pairs and could be ascribed to the intimate interface between CuO QDs and WO 3 NSs 37.From the EIS, the migration state of carriers in the electrode-electrolyte interface can be more deeply clarified 38,34.In Fig. 3e, CuO/WO 3 equip with a smaller radius in contrast with WO 3 , which suggests that the composites have a lower charge transfer resistance, faster separation, and migration of carriers 35.Interestingly, the photoelectrochemical results are consistent with the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction test, which indicates a low photogenerated carrier recombination rate could benefit to the CO 2 photoreduction.However, the Nitrogen absorption-desorption isotherms show a slightly decreased BET of CuO QDs/WO 3 NSs compared to the pure WO 3 NSs (Fig. 3f), which is contrary to the above-mentioned photoelectrochemical results (Fig. 3aee), indicating that the smaller specific surface area of CuO QDs/WO 3 NSs have no direct effects in CO 2 photoreduction in this work.To figure out the connection between the above characteristics (special microstructure and photoelectrochemical property) and photocatalytic activity, the CO 2 photoreduction measurements were carried out under 4 h continuous visible-light irradiation (l 400 nm) in the CO 2 and H 2 O (vapor) atmosphere.As shown in Fig. 4a, no products were detected over the single WO 3 and CuO, which could be ascribed to the faintish redox ability and fast photogenerated carrier recombination.However, CO is the main products over all composites, and a little O 2 is also generated during the CO 2 photoreduction process.It is worth noting that no H 2 is detected during the CO 2 photoreduction, which suggests that the loaded CuO QDs tent to product CO through a dual electron reduction and cannot function as the active sites for the reduction of H 2 O to H 2 .Moreover, the photoelectrochemical measurement results all point that CuO QDs/WO 3 NSs perform an enhanced visible light absorption, a lowest photoinduced carrier recombination rate, a longest carrier lifetime, and a fastest charge transfer rate, which can reasonably explain the superior activity of the composites compared to pure CuO and WO 3 .To further screen out the highest efficiency photocatalyst for CO 2 photocatalytic reduction, the photocatalytic tests of the different CuO loading amounts of WO 3 were carried out.The 6CuO/WO 3 shows a highest CO generation rate about 1.58 mmol g A1 h A1 under visible-light irradiation (Fig. 4a andb), which indicates that the separation of photogenerated carriers have a strong correlation with the CuO loading amounts and the 6CuO loading amounts could equip a most excellent separation efficiency 37. To explain the origin of the carbon source and the catalytic mechanism of the generated CO, different CO 2 photoreduction experiments of CuO/WO 3 were investigated under different reaction conditions.In Fig. 3d, column 1, no products are detected under dark conditions, indicating the photocatalytic nature of the CO 2 reduction reaction 35.Without the addition of H 2 O (vapor), the CO generation decreased sharply (Fig. 3d, column 2), indicating that the high CO generation rate of the composites must simultaneously realize the oxidation of H 2 O and the reduction of CO 2 , which is consistent with the results of CO and O 2 products 36.In the lack of photocatalysts (Fig. 3d, column 3), no CO is generated.Moreover (Fig. 3d, column 4), when the reactor was filled by N 2 and H 2 O (vapor) rather than CO 2 , no CO is detected and just a little H 2 arises, which confirm that the raw CO 2 is the key to the generation of CO.Based on these details of CO 2 photoreduction, the function of the CuO QDs during the whole catalytic system was further investigated.The highest activity of 6CuO/WO 3 was further calcined under 400 C in air for 1 h, and then it showed a slightly larger size and an uneven distribution than the not calcined sample (Figure S2a), which could be attributed to the agglomeration under the high temperature 39.In Fig. 3d, column 5, the larger size of CuO exhibits a decreased CO 2 photoreduction activity compared to the CuO quantum dots, which indicates that the uniform distribution CuO QDs could provide a quite short photogenerated carriers transport distance and exposed more active sites.Consequently, the light, H 2 O, catalysts, and CO 2 are necessary conditions for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, and the size and the CuO distributed state also have an influence in the CO 2 photoreduction (Fig. 3d, column 6). To investigate the stability of the most optimal activity catalyst, recycling tests of 6CuO/WO 3 were adopted, and the yields of CO decreased slightly after five cycles (Fig. 4d).Accurately, the yield of CO decreased to 1.35 mmol g A1 h A1 after the fifth cycle, about 85.4 of the first run.Meanwhile, the XRD and TEM show the same special lattice plane and morphology compared to the initial sample after the fifth cycle (Figure S2b,c), which indicates that the CuO/ WO 3 heterostructure possess a superior photostability.Compared to the none activity of pure CuO and WO 3 , the CuO/WO 3 heterostructure is superior in the CO 2 photoreduction, and the arisen activity of CuO/WO 3 can be speculated to the formation of 0D/2D heterojunction at the contiguous interface of CuO QDs and WO 3 NSs, which suggests that the heterojunction could enhance the redox ability and accelerate the photogenerated carrier transfer compare to the pure catalysts. To validate the reason for the arisen activity of CuO QDs/WO 3 NSs in CO 2 photoreduction, the CB and VB edge positions of WO 3 and CuO require to be investigated.To pinpoint the band position of WO 3 , the Mott-Schottky (MS) measurement was carried out under different frequencies.The flat band potentials (E f ) of WO 3 was estimated to be 0.03 V vs. Ag/AgCl from the MS plot (Fig. 5a), which was equal to 0.64 V vs. NHE.The slope of the WO 3 MS plot is positive, indicating it's an n-type semiconductor 14,40.The valence band spectrum X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (VB-XPS) was adopted to analyze that the energy gap E vf of WO 3 between Fermi level (E f ) and valence band position (E VB ), and the value of E vf was 2.06 eV (Fig. 5b) 40,41.Based on the n-type semiconductor, the value of flat-band potential is equal to the Fermi level, and the WO 3 VB position is calculated to be 2.70 V 41,42.Considering the WO 3 bandgap (E g ) is 2.34 eV (Fig. 3a), the WO 3 conduction band position (E CB ) is calculated to be 0.36 V, which is close to the reported data 11.The CB position can be calculated from the equations as follow: As we know, the CB position (0.36 V vs. NHE) of single WO 3 is more positive than the position (A0.11V vs. NHE) of CO 2 /CO photoreduction.Therefore, the single WO 3 cannot favor the CO 2 photoreduction to CO 43, while the CuO QDs/WO 3 NSs composites have been verified to reduce the CO 2 under visible-light successfully.Considering the composites succeed in CO 2 photoreduction, the redox potential of composites should satisfy the fundamental requirement for CO 2 photoreduction to CO, which indicates that the CuO CB potential ought to reach to the potential of CO 2 /CO reduction and is more negative than single WO 3 .Furthermore, the UVevis DRS (Fig. 3a) shows the much smaller bandgap of CuO compared to single WO 3 , the possible migration process of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs at the interfacial phases were schematically proposed (Fig. 6a andb).In Fig. 6a, the photogenerated electrons of the CuO CB position will transfer to the WO 3 CB position, and the photogenerated holes of the WO 3 VB will transfer to the CuO VB position 44.However, the accumulated electrons in WO 3 CB position cannot reduce CO 2 to CO under this charge transfer mechanism, due to the potential of WO 3 CB is more positive than the standard redox potential of CO 2 /CO (A0.11V vs. NHE).Thus, if the transfer method of photogenerated charge carriers adopts the traditional charge band-band transfer mode (Fig. 6a) 44, the accumulated electrons in WO 3 CB haven't the access to realize the CO 2 photoreduction.Notably, the photocatalytic activity test clearly shows that the CuO/WO 3 heterojunction is favorable for CO and O 2 generation in CO 2 photoreduction.Therefore, the charge transfer method for the CuO QDs/WO 3 NSs heterojunction should not adopt a band-band mechanism, but a Z-scheme mechanism.Combining the CO 2 photoreduction results with the proposed Z-scheme mechanism, the VB position 2.70 V of WO 3 is more positive than the position of H 2 O/O 2 (1.24 V vs. NHE), which indicates that the photogenerated holes of WO 3 can promote the H 2 O oxidation effectively.Meanwhile, the special 0D/2D Z-scheme interface would make the photogenerated electrons of WO 3 transfer rapidly and recombine restrictedly, which makes the large amounts of photogenerated electrons quickly accumulate in the CuO CB.Considering the small size effect of CuO quantum dots, the accumulated photogenerated electrons could migrate to the surface promptly and conduct the CO 2 reduction.Therefore, the superior photocatalytic activity of composites can be ascribed to the enhanced redox ability and highly efficient carrier separation, which strongly proves the significance of special photogenerated electron-hole migration directions about Z-scheme heterointerface."}, {"llm generation": "UV-Vis", "source": "With the assistance of the

Synthesis CuO QDs/WO 3 NSs: 100 mg of WO 3 nanosheets were dissolved in 8 mL of deionized water and sonicated for 10 min in a 50 mL round-bottom flask.Then 100 mg of polyvinylpyrrolidone, 120 mg of L-ascorbic acid, and 300 mg of KBr were dissolved in the round-bottom flask.Then the solution was still sonicated for 10 min and put in an oil bath preset at 80 C under continuous stirring.After 10 min, different amounts (2.7 mg, 10.8 mg, 16.2 mg, 21.6 mg, and 27 mg) of CuCl 2 2H 2 O and 1 mL of deionized water were added into the solution under stirring, which denoted as 1CW, 4CW, 6 CW, 8CW, and 10CW.Finally, the yellow solution was kept 80 C in air for 4 h under stirring.The sample was washed with deionized water three times and absolute ethanol three times to remove impurity. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (FEI Tecnai G2 F20) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) (JEOL-JEM-2010) were applied to confirm the morphologies of materials.Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) was performed on a scanning electron microscope (Hitachi S-4800 II, Japan) to analyze the compositions of the prepared samples and qualitative and quantitative analysis of constant elements.The purity and crystallinity of the as-prepared CuO QDs/WO 3 NSs powders were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) using Cu Ka radiation (l 14 0.15406 nm) on a Bruker D8 Advance Xray diffractometer in the 2q range of 10e80 at a scanning rate of 10 min A1 .The surface composition was analyzed by an X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCA PHI500).UVevis diffuse reflection spectroscopy (DRS) was performed on a Shimadzu UV-2450 spectrophotometer equipped with a spherical diffuse reflectance accessory equipped with a diffuse reflectance accessory in the region of 200e1000 nm.The photoluminescence (PL) spectra for powder samples were employed on a Varian Cary Eclipse spectrometer under the excitation of 325 nm.Time-resolved fluorescence decay spectra were obtained on a QuantaMaster TimeMaster Spectrofluorometer (QuantaMaster 40, Photon Technology International, Inc.) with an excitation wavelength of 337 nm and detection wavelength of 469 nm.The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface areas were investigated by the TriStar II 3020 surface area analyzer (Micromeritics Instrument Corporation). Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction tests: 50 mg of sample was added in 3 mL of DI water to ultrasound and disperse uniformly, and dried at 60 C in a 280 mL home-made Pyrex glass reactor.After drying completely, 0.084 g of NaHCO 3 was added to the groove in the glass reactor.The nitrogen (5 mL/min) was passed through the liquid water to ensure the presence of saturated water vapor under atmospheric pressure.After nitrogen purifying for 20 min, 0.6 mL of H 2 SO 4 (2 mol L A1 ) aqueous solution was injected slowly to react with NaHCO 3 to product CO 2 and H 2 O vapor.Then the reactor was irradiated by a 300 W Xe lamp that equipped with a 400 nm cutoff filter.The gas products were detected by a gas chromatograph (CEAULIGHT GC-7920) and N 2 as a carrier gas.All the gas products were detected by the retention time and calibrated with a standard gas mixture, and the yield of gas products was calculated by the external standard method of peak areas. The photocurrent measurement and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were investigated by a CHI660B electrochemical analyzer in a standard three-electrode system, where Ag/ AgCl and Pt wire were used as reference and counter electrodes, respectively, and the samples were used as working electrodes.The detail of working electrodes is that the samples were spin-coated onto fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glasses.The electrolytes of photocurrent measurement and EIS analysis were carried out in 0.2 mol L A1 Na 2 SO 4 solution and 0.1 mol L A1 KCl solution containing 5 mmol L A1 K 4 Fe(CN) 6 /K 3 Fe(CN) 6 , respectively.Finally, the Mott-Schottky test was carried out in 0.5 mol L A1 Na 2 SO 4 solution with three different frequencies.In this study, the photoelectrochemical tests of pure CuO was not carried out, because the synthesized pure CuO was granular aggregate, which could make the electrochemical properties differ from the CuO QDs severely."}, {"llm generation": "Gas", "source": "To figure out the connection between the above characteristics (special microstructure and photoelectrochemical property) and photocatalytic activity, the CO 2 photoreduction measurements were carried out under 4 h continuous visible-light irradiation (l 400 nm) in the CO 2 and H 2 O (vapor) atmosphere.", "context": "To confirm the formation and 0D/2D heterostructure and to figure out the size and the composition of the synthesized CuO QDs/WO 3 NSs, TEM and HRTEM were carried out.Fig. 1a shows the process of hydrothermal and self-assembly synthesis about CuO QDs/WO 3 NSs heterostructure.The TEM image displays welldefined and smooth-faced nanosheets of pure WO 3 NSs (Fig. 1b).In Fig. 1c, a large number of additional black points can be observed compared to the smooth-faced WO 3 NSs (Fig. 1b), which confirms that CuO QDs are loaded on the WO 3 NSs successfully, and the average diameter of the uniform distribution 6CuO QDs is determined to be 1.6 nm (Fig. 1e).Moreover, compared to 6 Cu loading amounts, the 10 Cu loading amounts of the catalysts show larger black dots, which indicates that the particle size of CuO quantum dots could enlarge with the increasing of Cu loading amounts.The detailed microstructure was further investigated by the HRTEM image.As vividly shown in Fig. 1f, the 0.171 nm lattice spacings can be well indexed to the (020) planes of CuO, and 0.379 nm indexed to the (100) planes of WO 3 , suggesting that the 0D/2D heterointerface between CuO QDs and WO 3 NSs is formed, which could provide a rapid route for the carrier transfer.Furthermore, the composition and microstructure of 6CuO QDs/WO 3 NSs were further investigated by high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) and EDS elemental scanning (Fig. 1g), and the images show the uniform yellow color distribution of Cu element on the surface of WO 3 NSs, which further suggests the uniform distribution of CuO quantum dots.Consequently, the superior photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity can be preliminarily ascribed to the compact connected interface between uniform distribution CuO QDs and WO 3 NSs. To further analyze the composition of the as-prepared sample, XRD and XPS analyses were used to make a qualitative analysis.XRD pattern of the CuO QDs/WO 3 NSs (the composites are denoted as CW) show the additional diffraction peaks at 39.3 , 53.1 and 72.3 compared to the single WO 3 (JCPDS no.41e0905) in Fig. 2a, which corresponds to the (200), (020) and (311) facets of CuO (JCPDS no.44e0706) respectively, indicating the CuO was loaded on the WO 3 successfully.Moreover, XRD patterns of the different CuO loading amounts all show weak CuO characteristic peaks, which indicates the small size and the high dispersity of CuO.XPS analyses were performed to further investigate elemental compositions and the interaction between WO 3 NSs and CuO QDs.As shown in the XPS spectra, the W 4f binding energies of pure WO 3 NSs are 35.9eV and 37.9 eV (Fig. 2b), while the W 4f binding energies of the CuO/WO 3 negative shift to 35.7 eV and 37.7 eV, respectively (No special specification all of the CuO/WO 3 in the following content point to 6CuO/WO 3 , and the named QDs and NSs are omitted).Based on the Cu 2 attraction to the W 4f surrounding electrons, CuO/WO 3 shows the smaller W 4f binding energies compared to the pure WO 3 , indicates the intimate built-in electric field interaction is formed at the compact interface of CuO/ WO 3 .In Fig. 2c, the O 1s peaks of CuO/WO 3 locate at 530.3 eV and 532.1 eV, and have a slight negatively shift compared to the pure WO 3 , which could be attributed to the strongly coupled heterointerfaces between CuO QDs and WO 3 NSs 28.Moreover, compared to the O1s of pure WO 3 , no signal of new oxygen species arisen in CuO/WO 3 , which indicates that no residual PVP surfactant 29.The XPS survey spectrum of Cu 2p (Fig. 2d) displays the dominant band energies at 932.5 eV and 952.5 eV, respectively, which are the typical Cu 2 characteristic of CuO 30.The presence of weak peaks located at 931.1 eV and 950.8 eV confirm the infinitesimal presence of Cu 31,32.The weak satellite peaks at 942.8 eV, and 945.9 eV correspond to Cu 2 , and attributed to the open 3 d 9 shell of Cu (II) 30,33.Meanwhile, the full scan survey XPS spectrum of the CuO/WO 3 heterostructure clearly shown the presence of Cu, O, and W elements (Figure S1).Owing to the different detection sensitivity and detection depth between XRD and XPS, the CuO QDs characteristic planes were successfully detected by XRD, and the Cu 2 was also clearly detected by the XPS, which implied that the small size and high dispersity CuO QDs were loaded on the WO 3 surface and the intimate heterojunctions formed between CuO QDs and WO 3 NSs. To evaluate the optical properties of as-prepared samples, UVevis DRS was carried out.As vividly shown in the UVevis DRS (Fig. 3a), pure WO 3 displays a visible-light absorption edge at approximate 525 nm, after combining with the narrow-bandgap semiconductors CuO, a slight red-shift is observed at the 550 nm absorption edge of CuO/WO 3 compared to the pure WO 3 , which indicates an enhanced visible-light harvesting ability of the composites and reveals a strong interaction from the CuO QDs/WO 3 NSs heterostructure.Based on the data of UVevis DRS, the Plot of (ahn) 1/2 vs. hn was also fitted to further evaluate the bandgap energies of the as-prepared samples, and the bandgap energies of WO 3 , CuO, and CuO/WO 3 are 2.34 eV, 1.31 eV, and 2.28 eV respectively, which also proves the coupling between WO 3 NSs and CuO QDs can enhance the visible-light absorption of WO 3 NSs and benefit to the photocatalytic process.To study the separation properties of photogenerated electrons and holes, the PL spectra of the WO 3 and CuO/WO 3 were examined.As shown in Fig. 3b, CuO/ WO 3 shows weaker steady-state PL emission peaks at 469 nm, indicating the lower photogenerated carrier recombination, which could be ascribed to the conjecture that the Z-scheme photocarriers transfer could promote the photogenerated carrier separation between WO 3 and CuO.To further verify the function of CuO/WO 3 heterojunction in the photogenerated carriers transfer process, the time-resolved fluorescence study was carried.As shown in Fig. 3c and Table S1, the fluorescent lifetime t of CuO/WO 3 is 18.7533 ns, which is much longer than WO 3 , further suggesting that the recombination of charge carriers over CuO/WO 3 have been restrained effectively 34e36.Furthermore, the detailed fluorescent lifetime t 2 of CuO/WO 3 is much longer than WO 3 , indicating a much lower direct recombination rate of photogenerated charge carriers in the composite, which further prove that the compact interface between CuO QDs and WO 3 NSs can benefit the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes. Meanwhile, the charge transfer properties are further revealed by a series of electrochemical measurements.The transient photocurrent response was applied to give the evidence about charge separation under visible-light irradiation, an enhanced photocurrent intensity of CuO/WO 3 could be recognized distinct from the pure WO 3 (Fig. 3d), which corresponds to a higher separation efficiency of photogenerated electron-hole pairs and could be ascribed to the intimate interface between CuO QDs and WO 3 NSs 37.From the EIS, the migration state of carriers in the electrode-electrolyte interface can be more deeply clarified 38,34.In Fig. 3e, CuO/WO 3 equip with a smaller radius in contrast with WO 3 , which suggests that the composites have a lower charge transfer resistance, faster separation, and migration of carriers 35.Interestingly, the photoelectrochemical results are consistent with the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction test, which indicates a low photogenerated carrier recombination rate could benefit to the CO 2 photoreduction.However, the Nitrogen absorption-desorption isotherms show a slightly decreased BET of CuO QDs/WO 3 NSs compared to the pure WO 3 NSs (Fig. 3f), which is contrary to the above-mentioned photoelectrochemical results (Fig. 3aee), indicating that the smaller specific surface area of CuO QDs/WO 3 NSs have no direct effects in CO 2 photoreduction in this work.To figure out the connection between the above characteristics (special microstructure and photoelectrochemical property) and photocatalytic activity, the CO 2 photoreduction measurements were carried out under 4 h continuous visible-light irradiation (l 400 nm) in the CO 2 and H 2 O (vapor) atmosphere.As shown in Fig. 4a, no products were detected over the single WO 3 and CuO, which could be ascribed to the faintish redox ability and fast photogenerated carrier recombination.However, CO is the main products over all composites, and a little O 2 is also generated during the CO 2 photoreduction process.It is worth noting that no H 2 is detected during the CO 2 photoreduction, which suggests that the loaded CuO QDs tent to product CO through a dual electron reduction and cannot function as the active sites for the reduction of H 2 O to H 2 .Moreover, the photoelectrochemical measurement results all point that CuO QDs/WO 3 NSs perform an enhanced visible light absorption, a lowest photoinduced carrier recombination rate, a longest carrier lifetime, and a fastest charge transfer rate, which can reasonably explain the superior activity of the composites compared to pure CuO and WO 3 .To further screen out the highest efficiency photocatalyst for CO 2 photocatalytic reduction, the photocatalytic tests of the different CuO loading amounts of WO 3 were carried out.The 6CuO/WO 3 shows a highest CO generation rate about 1.58 mmol g A1 h A1 under visible-light irradiation (Fig. 4a andb), which indicates that the separation of photogenerated carriers have a strong correlation with the CuO loading amounts and the 6CuO loading amounts could equip a most excellent separation efficiency 37. To explain the origin of the carbon source and the catalytic mechanism of the generated CO, different CO 2 photoreduction experiments of CuO/WO 3 were investigated under different reaction conditions.In Fig. 3d, column 1, no products are detected under dark conditions, indicating the photocatalytic nature of the CO 2 reduction reaction 35.Without the addition of H 2 O (vapor), the CO generation decreased sharply (Fig. 3d, column 2), indicating that the high CO generation rate of the composites must simultaneously realize the oxidation of H 2 O and the reduction of CO 2 , which is consistent with the results of CO and O 2 products 36.In the lack of photocatalysts (Fig. 3d, column 3), no CO is generated.Moreover (Fig. 3d, column 4), when the reactor was filled by N 2 and H 2 O (vapor) rather than CO 2 , no CO is detected and just a little H 2 arises, which confirm that the raw CO 2 is the key to the generation of CO.Based on these details of CO 2 photoreduction, the function of the CuO QDs during the whole catalytic system was further investigated.The highest activity of 6CuO/WO 3 was further calcined under 400 C in air for 1 h, and then it showed a slightly larger size and an uneven distribution than the not calcined sample (Figure S2a), which could be attributed to the agglomeration under the high temperature 39.In Fig. 3d, column 5, the larger size of CuO exhibits a decreased CO 2 photoreduction activity compared to the CuO quantum dots, which indicates that the uniform distribution CuO QDs could provide a quite short photogenerated carriers transport distance and exposed more active sites.Consequently, the light, H 2 O, catalysts, and CO 2 are necessary conditions for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, and the size and the CuO distributed state also have an influence in the CO 2 photoreduction (Fig. 3d, column 6). To investigate the stability of the most optimal activity catalyst, recycling tests of 6CuO/WO 3 were adopted, and the yields of CO decreased slightly after five cycles (Fig. 4d).Accurately, the yield of CO decreased to 1.35 mmol g A1 h A1 after the fifth cycle, about 85.4 of the first run.Meanwhile, the XRD and TEM show the same special lattice plane and morphology compared to the initial sample after the fifth cycle (Figure S2b,c), which indicates that the CuO/ WO 3 heterostructure possess a superior photostability.Compared to the none activity of pure CuO and WO 3 , the CuO/WO 3 heterostructure is superior in the CO 2 photoreduction, and the arisen activity of CuO/WO 3 can be speculated to the formation of 0D/2D heterojunction at the contiguous interface of CuO QDs and WO 3 NSs, which suggests that the heterojunction could enhance the redox ability and accelerate the photogenerated carrier transfer compare to the pure catalysts. To validate the reason for the arisen activity of CuO QDs/WO 3 NSs in CO 2 photoreduction, the CB and VB edge positions of WO 3 and CuO require to be investigated.To pinpoint the band position of WO 3 , the Mott-Schottky (MS) measurement was carried out under different frequencies.The flat band potentials (E f ) of WO 3 was estimated to be 0.03 V vs. Ag/AgCl from the MS plot (Fig. 5a), which was equal to 0.64 V vs. NHE.The slope of the WO 3 MS plot is positive, indicating it's an n-type semiconductor 14,40.The valence band spectrum X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (VB-XPS) was adopted to analyze that the energy gap E vf of WO 3 between Fermi level (E f ) and valence band position (E VB ), and the value of E vf was 2.06 eV (Fig. 5b) 40,41.Based on the n-type semiconductor, the value of flat-band potential is equal to the Fermi level, and the WO 3 VB position is calculated to be 2.70 V 41,42.Considering the WO 3 bandgap (E g ) is 2.34 eV (Fig. 3a), the WO 3 conduction band position (E CB ) is calculated to be 0.36 V, which is close to the reported data 11.The CB position can be calculated from the equations as follow: As we know, the CB position (0.36 V vs. NHE) of single WO 3 is more positive than the position (A0.11V vs. NHE) of CO 2 /CO photoreduction.Therefore, the single WO 3 cannot favor the CO 2 photoreduction to CO 43, while the CuO QDs/WO 3 NSs composites have been verified to reduce the CO 2 under visible-light successfully.Considering the composites succeed in CO 2 photoreduction, the redox potential of composites should satisfy the fundamental requirement for CO 2 photoreduction to CO, which indicates that the CuO CB potential ought to reach to the potential of CO 2 /CO reduction and is more negative than single WO 3 .Furthermore, the UVevis DRS (Fig. 3a) shows the much smaller bandgap of CuO compared to single WO 3 , the possible migration process of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs at the interfacial phases were schematically proposed (Fig. 6a andb).In Fig. 6a, the photogenerated electrons of the CuO CB position will transfer to the WO 3 CB position, and the photogenerated holes of the WO 3 VB will transfer to the CuO VB position 44.However, the accumulated electrons in WO 3 CB position cannot reduce CO 2 to CO under this charge transfer mechanism, due to the potential of WO 3 CB is more positive than the standard redox potential of CO 2 /CO (A0.11V vs. NHE).Thus, if the transfer method of photogenerated charge carriers adopts the traditional charge band-band transfer mode (Fig. 6a) 44, the accumulated electrons in WO 3 CB haven't the access to realize the CO 2 photoreduction.Notably, the photocatalytic activity test clearly shows that the CuO/WO 3 heterojunction is favorable for CO and O 2 generation in CO 2 photoreduction.Therefore, the charge transfer method for the CuO QDs/WO 3 NSs heterojunction should not adopt a band-band mechanism, but a Z-scheme mechanism.Combining the CO 2 photoreduction results with the proposed Z-scheme mechanism, the VB position 2.70 V of WO 3 is more positive than the position of H 2 O/O 2 (1.24 V vs. NHE), which indicates that the photogenerated holes of WO 3 can promote the H 2 O oxidation effectively.Meanwhile, the special 0D/2D Z-scheme interface would make the photogenerated electrons of WO 3 transfer rapidly and recombine restrictedly, which makes the large amounts of photogenerated electrons quickly accumulate in the CuO CB.Considering the small size effect of CuO quantum dots, the accumulated photogenerated electrons could migrate to the surface promptly and conduct the CO 2 reduction.Therefore, the superior photocatalytic activity of composites can be ascribed to the enhanced redox ability and highly efficient carrier separation, which strongly proves the significance of special photogenerated electron-hole migration directions about Z-scheme heterointerface."}], "reactor type": [], "operation mode": []}}
