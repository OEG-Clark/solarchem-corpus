As shown in Fig. 5, to further verify the combination of Cd x Cu 1-x S and CuO in the composites and the formation of heterojunctions, the energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) elemental mapping measurements were performed.The EDS spectrum of CCS-3/CuO/CM on a microscale confirmed the presence of Cd, Cu, O and S elements in the composite and showed that Cd x Cu 1-x S could uniformly grew on the surface of CuO nanowires.Element distribution density showed the catalyst morphology which was consistent with the SEM and TEM results.Furthermore, the weight percentages of different elements in the CCS-3/ CuO/CM composite were calculated and shown in Table S1 and the EDS spectrum diagram was show in Support Information.According to atomic fraction of metal cations and anions and their mass fraction ratio, we speculated that in the process of growth of nanosheets the changes in nonmetallic elements coordinated with cations were taken place leading the cationic vacancy formation.The specific details still need to be further explored.All these findings show that the heterojunctions with excellent interface interaction in CCS-3/CuO/CM were successfully constructed. As shown in Fig. 6, we further measured the composite catalyst with high resolution transmission electron microscope and found that the catalyst presented regular wire/sheet structure.We selected areas at the junction for discussing and confirmed the existence of CdS, CuS and CuO and the formation of heterojunctions through the discrimination of lattice fringe and lattice spacing.The results were consistent with SEM above. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was done for the catalysts to show the diffraction crystallography properties in Fig. 7.There were two diffraction peaks at 2 43.110).The XRD pattern indicated the purity of the synthesized samples.After Cd x Cu 1-x S nanosheets growth on the CuO/CM surface, the XRD pattern retained all the peaks of CuO, indicating that the crystal structure of CuO remained intact after the formation of heterojunctions. As shown in Fig. 8, XPS analysis was used to further characterize the as-prepared catalysts.All the main peaks could be indexed into Cd, Cu, S and O in well agreement with the synthesis conditions.There was one peak of C in the spectrum and that was a legitimate phenomenon caused by machines.The two stronger peaks at around 932.0 eV and 951.9 eV from Cu 2p region were in accordance with the binding energy peaks for Cu 2p 3/2 and Cu 2p 1/2 .The Cd 3d region could be fitted into two main peaks locating at 405 eV and 412 eV which were assigned to the binding energies of Cd 3d 5/2 and Cd 3d 3/2 , suggesting the existence of Cd 2 in CdS.The two main peaks located at 162.3 eV (S 2p 3/2 ) and 163.5 eV (S 2p 1/2 ) were observed which were assigned to S 2-, indicating the presence of metal sulfides.Another peak at around 161.5 eV appeared for the XPS spectra of S 2p region, confirming the formation of metal sulfides including Cu 2 S 48. Fig. 9 shows the fluorescence photoluminescence spectra of CuO/ CM, CCS-1/CuO/CM, CCS-3/CuO/CM and CCS-5/CuO/CM.When the excitation wavelength was 254 nm, all curves showed similar trends and two emission peaks could be observed at 350 nm and 470 nm.The intensity of the PL emission peak first decreased and then increased with the increase of the amount of CdxCu 1-x S introduced.Excessive loading might cause the nanosheets to agglomerate on the periphery of the nanowires, which would extend the path of photogenerated carriers to the heterojunction interface, thereby increasing the probability of mutual recombination.Compared with CuO/CM, the photoluminescence emission peak intensity of the composite catalyst was greatly reduced.The introduction of Cd x Cu 1-x S could form multiple heterojunctions, and the vacancy defects formed during the preparation of the catalyst could be used to capture photogenerated carriers, which greatly improved the separation of electrons and holes. Fig. 10 showed the UV-visible absorption spectra of the single and composite catalysts.It could be seen that CuO/CM and Cd x Cu 1-x S/CuO/ CM both had excellent light absorption capacity in ultraviolet and visible region.After introduced Cd x Cu 1-x S nanosheets on the surface of the CuO nanowires, the overall light absorption capacity of the catalyst increased.In particular, the absorption in visible light region was obviously enhanced which indicated that the Cd x Cu 1-x S/CuO coaxial heterostructures increased the coefficient of light utilization 49.In addition, the LMCT-type transition, the existence of vacancy defects, and the 2 Eg-2Tg transition from O atom to Cu atom all contributed to the enhancement of the light absorption performance of the catalyst 50.These characteristics were advantageous to the utilization of solar energy and will be helpful to the promotion and use of catalysts.When the immersion time is 3 min, the optimal light absorbing catalyst was obtained, which was greatly related to its regular morphology and moderate loading amount. The electrochemical properties of the catalyst were determined.The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) as shown in Fig. 11, the intrinsic resistance of CM was lower than CCS-3/CuO/CM, while the After the photocatalytic reaction, the liquid phase products were detected by gas chromatograph which showed that methanol peak appeared.The yields of different catalysts were measured after 4 h of irradiation.The methanol yield was higher than that of the pure CuO/ CM after Cd x Cu 1-x S loading.With the amount of Cd x Cu 1-x S loading increased, the methanol yield first increased and then decreased.The yield reached the highest when the immersion time was 3 min in the preparation of Cd x Cu 1-x S on the CuO/CM.The maximum yield of the composite catalyst reached 3.60 mol g -1 after 4 h of light, which was 2.81 times as the efficiency of CuO/CM (see Fig. 12).The efficiency of the reactions using CM, CuO/CM and CCS-3/CuO/CM as photocatalysts was measured at different reaction times (see Fig. 13).The results showed that the total methanol yield was on the rise with the increase of time within 4 h.This was consistent with many literature reports.It was speculated that 4h might be just the front end of the whole catalytic reaction, and the yield would tend to be stable over time.We compared the performance of this catalyst with other catalysts reported in Table 1. Fig. 14 illustrates that the CCS-3/CuO/CM was used for the photocatalytic cycle experiment.After the same catalyst was used for four times, the efficiency of photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 to produce methanol could still reach more than 60.9 of the initial efficiency, which proved that the catalyst had good stability.The degradation of catalyst performance may be caused by the irreversible photocorrosion of Cd x Cu 1-x S nanosheets and the partial detachment of selected catalyst during the cycling process. When CuO/CM was not coated with Cd x Cu 1-x S, CuO/CM could reduce CO 2 and generate a small amount of methanol under the action of optical drive.There were two possible reasons for this.First of all, under the action of light, CuO semiconductor could generate the mutual transformation between Cu 2 and Cu on the micro level.When Cu needed to be oxidized to form a more expensive state, it just formed a complete reaction with the half reaction of CO 2 reduction.Moreover, it was found by research that Cu 2 O had a wonderful efficiency and selectivity for CO 2 reduction and methanol production.Secondly, when CuO was formed by thermal oxidation on the surface of a Cu mesh, a thin layer of Cu 2 O would be formed between the Cu mesh and the CuO layer, which is closely bound together.The recombination of electron holes was reduced to a certain extent when carriers generated by the light excitation of the outer surface of the catalyst were transported to the interior.This was also advantageous for photocatalytic reactions.According to the band structure of CuO and Cd x Cu 1-x S, it could be judged that they could form heterojunctions.In other words, when the composite Cd x Cu 1-x S/CuO/CM was irradiated by light, the photogenerated electrons transfered from the conduction band of CuO to the conduction band of CuS and CdS which were together with the photogenerated electrons of CdS itself reduced the CO 2 .However the photogenerated holes transfered in the opposite direction and eventually arrived the conduction band of CuS and CuO.At this point, electron hole transfer between the external heterojunctions dominates, and the existence of trace Cu 2 O inside can be ignored.There was another point that could not be ignored, when CuO nanowires came into contact with Cd 2 and S 2-, CdS/CuS heterostructure was formed which was the result of continuous migration of copper ions.In this process, vacancy defects were bound to Fig. 1.Photocatalyst preparation process.

We hypothesized the mechanism of the reaction.First, the CO 2 activation was harder and single electron reduction potential was -1.9 ev, so from the CO 2 generated CO 2 - is the control step of the photocatalytic reaction.The CO 2 - could receive H and generated -COOH, then received the H and e -get CO and H 2 O.This intermediate continued to be reduced and would get CHOH, after six electronic reduction the target product CH 3 OH was obtained finally.The apparent total reaction equation was as follows (1) to (5) and the specific reaction was shown in Fig. 16."}, {"llm generation": "Cd x Cu 1-x S/CuO/CM", "source": "In summary, the columnar cactus-like hierarchical nanomaterial Cd x Cu 1-x S/CuO/CM was prepared by a facile multi-step synthetic route for photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .", "context": "In summary, the columnar cactus-like hierarchical nanomaterial Cd x Cu 1-x S/CuO/CM was prepared by a facile multi-step synthetic route for photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .The prepared catalysts possess some significant advantages involving unique and stable structure, increased specific surface area, broad and obvious visible light absorban, effective electron hole transfer and separation and abundant active sites.Compared with the pure CuO/CM, the efficiency of the composite catalyst was increased by 2.81 times and reached 3.60 mol g -1 cat.The catalysts solve environmental and energy problems by converting cheap, readily available light energy into chemical energy.This can play a certain guiding role in the utilization and development of new energy in the future.

The catalyst was then placed on a horizontal gas-liquid interface.Next, the reactor was purified with CO 2 for 30 min so that both the gas and liquid phases in the reactor were saturated with CO 2 , and the pressure inside the reactor was atmospheric.Then the inlet and outlet of the tubular reactor were closed.The entire quartz tube was illuminated by a 350W xenon lamp (full spectrum) with a cold trap.The temperature of the quartz tube was kept at room temperature during the entire reaction.The lamp source was 10 cm above the tubular reactor.The liquid products were analyzed by gas chromatograph (GC-2014) equipped with FID detector and HP-Plot Q capillary column.The product injection volume is 1 l.N 2 was the carrier gas and its flow rate was 30 ml/min. The column temperature was initially 110 C and held for 15min, then raised to 180 C and held for 5min.Controlled experiments were carried out under dark conditions."}, {"llm generation": "Liquid, Gas", "source": "Fig. 2. Gas-liquid-solid three-phase reactor for photocatalytic reaction.", "context": "The CuO nanowires prepared by thermal oxidation provided pretty templates for the growth of Cd x Cu 1-x S nanosheets.The SILAR technology enabled the staggered 2D Cd x Cu 1-x S nanosheets to grow in suit on CuO nanowires, and the morphology showed relatively regular arrangement.The modified CuO nanowires still maintain the rod-like morphology (see Fig. 4).When the immersion time was 1 min, the grown Cd x Cu 1-x S nanosheets were small and uneven, showing a disorderly arrangement.When the immersion time was 3 min, the Cd x Cu 1-x S nanosheets grown showed a relatively orderly arrangement and uniform size.However, when the immersion time was extended to 5 min, the grown Cd x Cu 1-x S nanosheets were agglomerated with each other, and the nanosheets became thicker and their morphology was not neat enough.The SEM images of the catalysts showed that as the immersion time namely reaction time increased of CuO/CM in the anion solution and cation solution, the 2D Cd x Cu 1-x S nanosheets on CuO surface would always grow.The smaller nanosheets from the beginning would grow into more uniform nanosheets, and finally would agglomerate into blocks.Overall, the SILAR method enabled Cd x Cu 1-x to grow in situ on the CuO nanowires without any binder.The CuO nanowires coated with Cd x Cu 1-x S nanosheets appeared like columnar cactus. As shown in Fig. 5, to further verify the combination of Cd x Cu 1-x S and CuO in the composites and the formation of heterojunctions, the energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) elemental mapping measurements were performed.The EDS spectrum of CCS-3/CuO/CM on a microscale confirmed the presence of Cd, Cu, O and S elements in the composite and showed that Cd x Cu 1-x S could uniformly grew on the surface of CuO nanowires.Element distribution density showed the catalyst morphology which was consistent with the SEM and TEM results.Furthermore, the weight percentages of different elements in the CCS-3/ CuO/CM composite were calculated and shown in Table S1 and the EDS spectrum diagram was show in Support Information.According to atomic fraction of metal cations and anions and their mass fraction ratio, we speculated that in the process of growth of nanosheets the changes in nonmetallic elements coordinated with cations were taken place leading the cationic vacancy formation.The specific details still need to be further explored.All these findings show that the heterojunctions with excellent interface interaction in CCS-3/CuO/CM were successfully constructed. As shown in Fig. 6, we further measured the composite catalyst with high resolution transmission electron microscope and found that the catalyst presented regular wire/sheet structure.We selected areas at the junction for discussing and confirmed the existence of CdS, CuS and CuO and the formation of heterojunctions through the discrimination of lattice fringe and lattice spacing.The results were consistent with SEM above. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was done for the catalysts to show the diffraction crystallography properties in Fig. 7.There were two diffraction peaks at 2 43.110).The XRD pattern indicated the purity of the synthesized samples.After Cd x Cu 1-x S nanosheets growth on the CuO/CM surface, the XRD pattern retained all the peaks of CuO, indicating that the crystal structure of CuO remained intact after the formation of heterojunctions. As shown in Fig. 8, XPS analysis was used to further characterize the as-prepared catalysts.All the main peaks could be indexed into Cd, Cu, S and O in well agreement with the synthesis conditions.There was one peak of C in the spectrum and that was a legitimate phenomenon caused by machines.The two stronger peaks at around 932.0 eV and 951.9 eV from Cu 2p region were in accordance with the binding energy peaks for Cu 2p 3/2 and Cu 2p 1/2 .The Cd 3d region could be fitted into two main peaks locating at 405 eV and 412 eV which were assigned to the binding energies of Cd 3d 5/2 and Cd 3d 3/2 , suggesting the existence of Cd 2 in CdS.The two main peaks located at 162.3 eV (S 2p 3/2 ) and 163.5 eV (S 2p 1/2 ) were observed which were assigned to S 2-, indicating the presence of metal sulfides.Another peak at around 161.5 eV appeared for the XPS spectra of S 2p region, confirming the formation of metal sulfides including Cu 2 S 48. Fig. 9 shows the fluorescence photoluminescence spectra of CuO/ CM, CCS-1/CuO/CM, CCS-3/CuO/CM and CCS-5/CuO/CM.When the excitation wavelength was 254 nm, all curves showed similar trends and two emission peaks could be observed at 350 nm and 470 nm.The intensity of the PL emission peak first decreased and then increased with the increase of the amount of CdxCu 1-x S introduced.Excessive loading might cause the nanosheets to agglomerate on the periphery of the nanowires, which would extend the path of photogenerated carriers to the heterojunction interface, thereby increasing the probability of mutual recombination.Compared with CuO/CM, the photoluminescence emission peak intensity of the composite catalyst was greatly reduced.The introduction of Cd x Cu 1-x S could form multiple heterojunctions, and the vacancy defects formed during the preparation of the catalyst could be used to capture photogenerated carriers, which greatly improved the separation of electrons and holes. Fig. 10 showed the UV-visible absorption spectra of the single and composite catalysts.It could be seen that CuO/CM and Cd x Cu 1-x S/CuO/ CM both had excellent light absorption capacity in ultraviolet and visible region.After introduced Cd x Cu 1-x S nanosheets on the surface of the CuO nanowires, the overall light absorption capacity of the catalyst increased.In particular, the absorption in visible light region was obviously enhanced which indicated that the Cd x Cu 1-x S/CuO coaxial heterostructures increased the coefficient of light utilization 49.In addition, the LMCT-type transition, the existence of vacancy defects, and the 2 Eg-2Tg transition from O atom to Cu atom all contributed to the enhancement of the light absorption performance of the catalyst 50.These characteristics were advantageous to the utilization of solar energy and will be helpful to the promotion and use of catalysts.When the immersion time is 3 min, the optimal light absorbing catalyst was obtained, which was greatly related to its regular morphology and moderate loading amount. The electrochemical properties of the catalyst were determined.The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) as shown in Fig. 11, the intrinsic resistance of CM was lower than CCS-3/CuO/CM, while the After the photocatalytic reaction, the liquid phase products were detected by gas chromatograph which showed that methanol peak appeared.The yields of different catalysts were measured after 4 h of irradiation.The methanol yield was higher than that of the pure CuO/ CM after Cd x Cu 1-x S loading.With the amount of Cd x Cu 1-x S loading increased, the methanol yield first increased and then decreased.The yield reached the highest when the immersion time was 3 min in the preparation of Cd x Cu 1-x S on the CuO/CM.The maximum yield of the composite catalyst reached 3.60 mol g -1 after 4 h of light, which was 2.81 times as the efficiency of CuO/CM (see Fig. 12).The efficiency of the reactions using CM, CuO/CM and CCS-3/CuO/CM as photocatalysts was measured at different reaction times (see Fig. 13).The results showed that the total methanol yield was on the rise with the increase of time within 4 h.This was consistent with many literature reports.It was speculated that 4h might be just the front end of the whole catalytic reaction, and the yield would tend to be stable over time.We compared the performance of this catalyst with other catalysts reported in Table 1. Fig. 14 illustrates that the CCS-3/CuO/CM was used for the photocatalytic cycle experiment.After the same catalyst was used for four times, the efficiency of photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 to produce methanol could still reach more than 60.9 of the initial efficiency, which proved that the catalyst had good stability.The degradation of catalyst performance may be caused by the irreversible photocorrosion of Cd x Cu 1-x S nanosheets and the partial detachment of selected catalyst during the cycling process. When CuO/CM was not coated with Cd x Cu 1-x S, CuO/CM could reduce CO 2 and generate a small amount of methanol under the action of optical drive.There were two possible reasons for this.First of all, under the action of light, CuO semiconductor could generate the mutual transformation between Cu 2 and Cu on the micro level.When Cu needed to be oxidized to form a more expensive state, it just formed a complete reaction with the half reaction of CO 2 reduction.Moreover, it was found by research that Cu 2 O had a wonderful efficiency and selectivity for CO 2 reduction and methanol production.Secondly, when CuO was formed by thermal oxidation on the surface of a Cu mesh, a thin layer of Cu 2 O would be formed between the Cu mesh and the CuO layer, which is closely bound together.The recombination of electron holes was reduced to a certain extent when carriers generated by the light excitation of the outer surface of the catalyst were transported to the interior.This was also advantageous for photocatalytic reactions.According to the band structure of CuO and Cd x Cu 1-x S, it could be judged that they could form heterojunctions.In other words, when the composite Cd x Cu 1-x S/CuO/CM was irradiated by light, the photogenerated electrons transfered from the conduction band of CuO to the conduction band of CuS and CdS which were together with the photogenerated electrons of CdS itself reduced the CO 2 .However the photogenerated holes transfered in the opposite direction and eventually arrived the conduction band of CuS and CuO.At this point, electron hole transfer between the external heterojunctions dominates, and the existence of trace Cu 2 O inside can be ignored.There was another point that could not be ignored, when CuO nanowires came into contact with Cd 2 and S 2-, CdS/CuS heterostructure was formed which was the result of continuous migration of copper ions.In this process, vacancy defects were bound to Fig. 1.Photocatalyst preparation process.

Fig.3shows the scanning electron microscope images of Cu mesh and CuO/CM.It clearly shows that the Cu mesh changes from its own color to black and gray from a macro perspective, and the relatively compact 1D CuO nanowires were formed on the surface from a micro perspective after high-temperature oxidation.The surface of the nanowires is smooth and their average length is about 10 m.The length and Fig. 5.

We hypothesized the mechanism of the reaction.First, the CO 2 activation was harder and single electron reduction potential was -1.9 ev, so from the CO 2 generated CO 2 - is the control step of the photocatalytic reaction.The CO 2 - could receive H and generated -COOH, then received the H and e -get CO and H 2 O.This intermediate continued to be reduced and would get CHOH, after six electronic reduction the target product CH 3 OH was obtained finally.The apparent total reaction equation was as follows (1) to (5) and the specific reaction was shown in Fig. 16."}], "reactor type": [], "operation mode": []}}
