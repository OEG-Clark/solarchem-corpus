A silkworm excrement (500 g) was soaked in ethanol with ultrasonic treatment to extract the chlorophyll (Chl-a) into ethanol.Then, the mixture was filtered and concentrated to get the chlorophyll paste.In order to substitute the Mg 2 by Cu 2 , the chlorophyll paste was dissolved in an acetone solution of copper acetate (1 mol L -1 ) and stirred for 12 hours.After adding water and allowing to stand for 15 minutes, the organic phase was collected, and this procedure was repeated 3 times to remove the excess copper acetate.Through further purification by column chromatography, a deep green Chl-Cu was obtained. The graphene sheet (GS) was prepared using the method in our previous work with the details described in the ESI. 34 Herein, a convenient film preparation method involving mist spray was applied.Typically, Chl-Cu (60 mg) was dissolved in a 100 mL solution (0.2 mg mL -1 ) of GS suspended in 1, 2 dichloroethane (DCE).Through a spray lance, the dispersion was ejected onto a 10 cm 20 cm substrate (quartz or polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film) held at 100 C and driven by N 2 at a certain pressure (0.4 MPa).Finally, in order to dispel the adsorbed solvent molecules, the prepared g-Chl-Cu films were dried in a 100 C vacuum oven for 2 h. The 1, 2 dichloroethane solution of the photocatalysts was dropped on a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) for modification and naturally dried at room temperature.A 0.5 M Na 2 SO 4 solution (20 mL) was filled in a Pyrex electrolytic cell and purged with Ar.A AgAgCl electrode and Pt wire were used as the reference and counter electrodes, respectively.Impedance measurements were recorded with frequencies of 500 Hz, 1000 Hz, and 2000 Hz using a CHI660 electrochemical workstation to investigate the approximative conduction band of the Chl-Cu by a Mott-Schottky plot. A double-faced photocatalytic film on 200 cm 2 PET was placed in a one liter quartz chamber, which had valves on the gas circuit for gas feeding and evacuation as shown in Fig. S1. This chamber was fixed on an on-line vacuum system, which possessed a vacuometer.This on-line vacuum system was connected to a gas chromatography (GC) system by a sample line.The total volume of the chamber and vacuum system was 1455 cm 3 .The photographs of this reaction system are shown in Fig. S1a b. The film with catalyst was loaded into the chamber, and then the chamber was sealed and evacuated before the injection of the reactant gas.An airflow of 99.99 pure CO 2 passed through a de-ionized water container and entered the reaction chamber finally.In order to clear away the air as thoroughly as possible, these procedures for CO 2 pumping and evacuation were repeated several times.The relative humidity of the CO 2 and H 2 O gas mixture was controlled at 85, while the pressure in this vacuum system was controlled at 98 kPa, less than atmospheric pressure.All photocatalytic CO 2 RR experiments were carried out under the irradiation of a solar simulator with a filter to cut off the ultraviolet light below 400 nm.The power density of light was 100 mW cm -2 as tested by an optical power meter (FZ-A, Perfectlight, Beijing China).The equilibrium temperature of the samples was about 45 C (5 C) under the cooling of circulating water.Therefore, the product formation rates were not obviously influenced by temperature.The chamber was wrapped with aluminum foil to use the light more effectively.After a period of irridiation, 5 mL of the gaseous sample was transferred into the GC system through a negative pressure sampling system.Then, the sample passed through a valve block in the GC system and was injected into three kinds of GC columns with a flame ionization detector (FID) and thermal conductivity detector (TCD) in parallel."}, {"llm generation": "Visible", "source": "In this work, the product of C 2 H 6 showed a considerable amount by visible light irradiation.", "context": "In summary, converting CO 2 to chemicals via a photocatalytic method can effectively reserve the solar energy in chemicals.
