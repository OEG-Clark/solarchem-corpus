Figure S1 shows the energy dispersive Xray spectroscopy (EDX) of the as-prepared Ni 3 B, and the atomic ratio of Ni: B is measured to be 4.52: 1, revealing that Ni is the exposed site in as-prepared Ni 3 B. The morphology of metal borides is investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images.Figure 1d, e, f show that the as-prepared Ni 3 B, Co 3 B and Fe 2 B samples present as aggregated particles, with the size in the range of tens of nanometers to hundreds nanometers.The transition electron microscopy (TEM) image in Figure S2 shows the typical aggregated nanoparticle shape of Ni 3 B, Co 3 B and Fe 2 B, consistent with the SEM observation.In the high-resolution transition electron microscopy (HRTEM) images, well-resolved lattice fringe spaces of 0.235 nm, 0.205 nm and 0.201 nm are observed for Ni 3 B, Co 3 B and Fe 2 B, corresponding to the (121), (220) and (121) crystallographic planes of of Ni 3 B, Co 3 B and Fe 2 B phase, respectively. Figure 2a summarizes the photocatalytic performances of metal borides cocatalysts in the initial one hour.Ni 3 B/Ru (Ni 3 B as cocatalyst and Ru as light absorber) exhibits a considerable CO evolution rate of 157.7 mol h -1 with a H 2 production rate of 11.8 mol h -1 during the 1 h reaction period, obtaining a high CO selectivity of 93.0.The apparent quantum yield (AQY) of CO evolution along with the wavelength of the incident light was investigated.As shown in Figure 2b, the variation tendency of AQY matches well with the light absorption spectrum of the Ru, indicating the CO 2 reduction reaction occurs photocatalytically by the Ru light absorber.Notably, the AQY at the monochromatic light of 420 nm was measured as high as 4.5.The achieved photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance outperforms the state-of-the-art cocatalysts under comparable conditions in the literature, as shown in Table photoreduction of CO 2 .It is very interesting to investigate the cocatalytic effect of other metal The (010) surface is chosen for simulation, as Ni 3 B (010) surface has the least barrier of 0.49 eV.The corresponding surface energy and structure of intermediate along the reaction path are shown in Figure S9 and Figure S10, respectively.The reaction free energy diagrams of the CO 2 reduction over Ni 3 B, Co 3 B and Fe 2 B are plotted in Figure 3b.As for Ni 3 B, Co 3 B and Fe 2 B, their rate-determining steps of the reaction are the dissociation of CO adduct, which are 0.49 eV, 0.81 eV and 1.33 eV, respectively.The free energy barrier of CO 2 reduction shows the expected trend of Ni 3 B Co 3 B Fe 2 B, consistent with the experimental results that Ni 3 B shows higher CO 2 reduction activity than Co 3 B and Fe 2 B. The above results have revealed the highly active Ni 3 B for promoting photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction, and now we are in a position to disclose the advantages of this structure. shows the normalized XANES spectra collected at Ni K-edge for Ni metal, NiO and Ni 3 B. The pre-edge region of Ni 3 B consists of a small peak at 8334 eV whose shape and position are similar to Ni metal, indicating predominance of the Ni 0 state in the sample.Figure 4c shows Fourier transformed EXAFS spectra of Ni metal, NiO and Ni 3 B.For the Ni metal, the peak at 2.20 A corresponds to the Ni-Ni bond.Ni 3 B exhibits a much weaker peak centered at 2.16 A, which is attributed to the Ni-Ni scattering pair in Ni 3 B. 34, 35 This peak position is smaller than that of Ni-Ni (2.20 A) in the Ni foil standard sample, which results from the chemical interaction involved hybridization and electron transfer between B 2p states with the Ni metal d orbitals. 34, 35The Ni-O bond at 1.65 A and Ni-O-Ni bond at 2.58 A are absent in Ni 3 B, indicating the portion of surface Ni 2 oxidation species in Ni 3 B is very low.Ni 3 B displays metallic feature, which can be confirmed by DFT calculations.As shown in Figure 4d, the total density of states (DOS) of Ni 3 B are mainly ascribed to the contribution from the d orbitals of Ni atom, and the values of DOS of Ni 3 B around the Fermi level (E f ) are all continuous without obvious bandgap, demonstrating the metallic feature of Ni 3 B.In addition, the p orbitals of B also displays the continuous nature, indicating the covalent interaction between B and Ni in the metallic state. Figure 5c shows the decay curves of Ru with and without Ni 3 B. The fitted average lifetimes are shown in Table S3, which indicates that the PL average lifetime increases in the following order: pure Ru Ni 3 B/Ru.The lengthened lifetime of Ru in the presence of Ni 3 B is ascribed to the electron transfer from Ru to Ni 3 B, and the electrons are accumulated on Ni 3 B. The mechanism for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction is displayed in Figure 5d and Figure S13 based on above results and the previous reports in Ru photosensitized systems. 22Under visible light irradiation, the electrons generated from photosensitizer Ru can be transferred to the metal borides cocatalysts.Then, the CO 2 moleculars absorbed on the surface of the metal borides is reduced to CO.The H 2 evolution is regarded as a competing reaction to the CO evolution, and Ni boride is demonstrated as the most effective cocatalyst to suppress the H 2 evolution and simultaneously maintain a record high CO evolution rate.To demonstrate the dominant role of Ni-B bond in Ni 3 B for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, the cocatalytic performances of Ni 3 B, air treated Ni 3 B, Ni nanoparticles and NiO were Page 12 of 23 Journal of Materials Chemistry A Journal of Materials Chemistry A Accepted Manuscript Published on 01 October 2020.Downloaded by UNSW Library on 10/1/2020 8:54:41 AM.View Article Online DOI: 10.1039/D0TA07072F evaluated and compared.Air treated Ni 3 B was prepared by thermal treatment of Ni 3 B in air at 300 0 C for 2 hours and Ni nanoparticles were prepared by thermal treatment of Ni 3 B in H 2 at 300 0 C for 2 hours.XRD pattern indicates that the air treated Ni 3 B also displays crystalline Ni 3 B phase structure (Figure S14), and H 2 treated Ni 3 B displays crystalline Ni phase structure (Figure S15).The SEM images show that air treated Ni 3 B and H 2 treated Ni 3 B exhibit aggregated particles, which have the similar morphology compared with Ni 3 B (Figure S16).However, the content of Ni-B bond on the surface of air treated Ni 3 B is significantly decreased, as revealed by XPS spectra (Figure S17).The decreased content of Ni-B bond is caused by the thermal oxidation of Ni 0 to Ni 2 in air.The photocatalytic performances of Ni 3 B, air treated Ni 3 B, Ni nanoparticles and NiO in the presence of Ru are shown in Figure S18.It is obvious that Ni 3 B exhibits much higher activity and selectivity than air treated Ni 3 B, Ni nanoparticles and NiO, demonstrating the dominant role of the Ni-B bond for promoting the photocatalytic CO 2 activation and reduction.The lower photocatalytic performance of NiO is due to its semiconducting features, whose conductivity and electron transfer efficiency is much lower than that of Ni 3 B (Figure S19).The existence of Ni-B bond in Ni 3 B is beneficial for the desorption of CO molecular, which can be revealed by the DFT calculations.The calculated CO adsorption energy was -0.27 eV over Ni 3 B(010) surface, which is much weaker than that over Ni(111) (-0.41 eV and -0.72 eV on top site and hollow site, respectively) (see computational details).The charge density analysis in Figure S20 further verifies the lower adsorption energy of CO over Ni 3 B(010) surface than that over Ni(111) surface, indicating COproduct is much easier to be released from Ni 3 B surface, which is one of the reasons why Ni 3 B exhibits much higher activity than Ni nanoparticles for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction (FigureS18). photocatalytic reactions.This work may provide fundamental guidance for the design of Published on 01 October 2020.Downloaded by UNSW Library on 10/1/2020 8:54:41 AM.View Article Online DOI: 10.1039/D0TA07072F This work received financial support from the World Premier International Research Center Initiative (WPI Initiative) on Materials Nanoarchitectonics (MANA), MEXT (Japan), JSPS KAKENHI (JP18H02065), the Photo-excitonix Project at Hokkaido University, National Natural Science Foundation of China (21633004), Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. NE2019103).
