X-ray diffraction patterns of the obtained materials (Fig. 1) show their characteristic crystalline structure. 17Thus, the NaNbO 3 sample is composed of a single phase with an orthorhombically distorted perovskite structure (NaNbO 3 , ICDD PDF 01-073-0803).This orthorhombic structure (ICDD PDF 01-073-0878) is also mainly present in NaTaO 3 together with a monoclinically distorted perovskite structure (NaTaO 3 , ICDD PDF 01-074-2478), with a minor contribution of an additional hexagonal phase (natrotantite Na 2 Ta 4 O 11 , ICDD PDF 01-084-0810).The results of Rietveld refinement of the powder diffractograms of the above mentioned structures are included in Table 1.The natrotantite phase is present in a ca.2.5 amount in the NaTaO 3 sample, which contains a ca.4.5 : 1 orthorhombic/monoclinic NaTaO 3 proportion.Only slight deviations (maximum 0.15) exist in cell parameters with respect to the reference structures.Large crystal sizes are found in both metallates, as could be expected considering that they were obtained by solid-state synthesis at high temperature.These large sizes are confirmed by TEM images, an example of which is shown in Fig. 2. In agreement with this, both catalysts present low surface areas, with values around In accordance with the synthesis temperature, the nitrogen adsorption isotherms (not shown) are of type-II in both cases, indicating that the solids are not porous and that the specific surface area is due to the external surface of the particles. The structural characterisation was complemented by Raman spectroscopy (Fig. 3).The bands in the Raman spectra are well matched with those described in the literature for NaNbO 3 18,19 and NaTaO 3 . 20Typical spectral profiles of perovskite structures, with intense bands in the 100-300 and 400-700 cm -1 regions, are observed.Thus, the NaNbO 3 spectrum shows bands at 125, 144 and 155 cm -1 corresponding to the librational modes of the NbO 6 octahedra.The rest of the observed bands are generated by the internal vibrations of the NbO 6 octahedra, with the triply degenerate F 2u and F 2g modes giving rise to the profile observed in the 170-300 cm -1 region, and the intense shouldered band centered at 605 cm -1 , which is assignable to symmetric stretching modes.The low intensity bands observed at ca. 380 and 435 cm -1 are indicative of a tilting angle between adjacent octahedra that deviates the NaNbO 3 crystalline phase from the ideal perovskite structure, as observed in the X-ray diffractograms discussed above. 21Also in line with the XRD data for NaNbO 3 , the weak band at 870 cm -1 corresponds to a combination mode in centrosymmetric space goups. 22Similar assignments can be made for NaTaO 3 .The spectrum presents bands at 140, 160, 204, and 222 cm -1 that are characteristic of Na translational vibration modes, which in the case of NaNbO 3 appear at Raman shifts below 100 cm -1 and are not observed due to the used Rayleigh filter. 18The bands at 263, 318 and 345 cm -1 can be assigned to the bending modes of TaO 6 octahedra, and those at 453, 499, and 626 cm -1 correspond to Ta-O stretching modes, with possible combination bands appearing at 693 and above 750 cm -1 .This band distribution is in good agreement with the main presence of an orthorhombic NaTaO 3 phase in this catalyst. 23ig. 4 shows the diffuse reflectance UV-vis spectra of NaNbO 3 and NaTaO 3 .As expected, the sharp absorption edge for NaTaO 3 appears at a higher energy than in the case of NaNbO 3 . 5,7,12133141516 Their corresponding band gap (E g ) values, included in Table 1, were calculated from Tauc plots considering a direct transition in NaTaO 3 , in accordance with the main contribution of the orthorhombic phase, 24 and an indirect transition in the case of NaNbO 3 . 25The obtained values are in good accordance with those described in the literature for these phases. 121314151624,25 The valence band potentials of NaTaO 3 and NaNbO 3 are similar because both consist of O 2p orbitals and the oxygen anions coordinate to Ta 5 or Nb 5 ions, which have the same ionic radius. 8Hence the difference in the band gaps arises from the higher energy (more negative reduction Vertical lines show the Bragg reflections corresponding to the refined phases (see text and Table 1).In agreement with the absorption spectra, photoluminescence (PL) measurements (Fig. 6) show a slight displacement of the band-to-band recombination emission (only the tail of which is observed due to the used cut-off filter) to lower wavelength when moving from NaNbO 3 to NaTaO 3 .The low-energy part of the spectra is composed of a broad emission band in the 400-600 cm -1 region, as is generally observed in ABO 3 perovskites, 27,28 and is formed by several contributions related to excitons and oxygen vacancies.In this region, it is observed that the PL intensity is lower in NaNbO 3 , which in general terms can be related to slower electron-hole recombination. 29otocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction Fig. 7 shows the accumulated amounts of the main reaction products over 15 h of irradiation, compared to those obtained with TiO 2 PC500 (S BET 165.8m 2 g -1 ).In all cases, the main CO 2 reduction products are CO, CH 4 and CH 3 OH, together with H 2 coming from the concomitant reduction of water competing with that of CO 2 .Trace amounts of other products like C 2 hydrocarbons and ethanol are obtained, with similar amounts for different catalysts.Reactions carried out in an argon atmosphere under irradiation gave rise to product evolution of less than 2 with respect to the tests performed feeding CO 2 H 2 O, indicating that the evolved gases in the presence of CO 2 and H 2 O do not arise from adventitious carbon contamination on the surface of the photocatalysts. Photochemical Photobiological Sciences In spite of their low surface areas (see Table 1), both NaNbO 3 and NaTaO 3 give rise to product amounts comparable to those with titania, although the production attained with the latter is considerably larger in all cases except for CH 4 .However, if the results are referred to the surface area unit, which would reflect the intrinsic photoactivity of the materials, the production with the synthesised metallates reveals considerable interest.In line with this, the measured PL spectrum of TiO 2 (Fig. 6), with slightly higher intensity than those of both perovskite materials, reveals that the larger net production with titania cannot be explained only in terms of photogenerated charge carrier utilisation. The comparison of NaNbO 3 and NaTaO 3 shows very similar production of CO and CH 3 OH, with the latter giving rise to a larger amount of CH 4 and a lower amount of H 2 .Overall, the total amount of carbon products is slightly larger (ca.2) for sodium tantalate.In comparative terms, the production results reported here for NaNbO 3 and NaTaO 3 are competitive with those previously reported for this kind of structure, especially if production normalised to a specific surface area is considered. 1213141516 Fig. 8 depicts the selectivities towards the main reaction products obtained with the different catalysts, calculated on the basis of these products only.The high selectivity to CO rather than to highly reduced carbon products (e.g.CH 4 ) is a common characteristic of oxide photocatalysts without the presence of a metal co-catalyst. 30In the case of TiO 2 this CO selectivity comes together with a considerable production of H 2 due to a hardly avoidable competition for conduction band electrons by CO 2 and H 2 O molecules. 31,32In the case of the metallates reported here, the selectivity towards carbon monoxide is even increased with respect to titania, and this comes mainly at the expense of hydrogen production as observed in Fig. 8. Therefore, the mentioned electron competition is interestingly shifted towards the reduction of CO 2 with the present catalysts, and is especially remarkable in the case of NaTaO 3 .A similar observation can be made regarding the selectivity of this catalyst towards methane, which is twice that obtained with both NaNbO 3 and TiO 2 . Therefore, it is demonstrated here that, in spite of the low surface area obtained by means of the solid-state synthetic method, both NaNbO 3 and NaTaO 3 perovskites exhibit interesting intrinsic activities for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 under UV irradiation.The comparison of the photoactivity of these metallates and their opto-electronic properties reveals the effect of opposed factors: on the one hand, NaNbO 3 presents a lower electron-hole recombination as revealed by its PL spectrum (Fig. 5); on the other hand, as explained in the discussion of UV-vis spectra and displayed in Fig. 5, the electrons in the conduction band of NaTaO 3 have a higher energy (more negative reduction potential) than those in NaNbO 3 , which implies a larger driving force for reduction reactions. 33imilar observations in this last respect have been made in photocatalytic hydrogen production reactions. 8,9,11As a result of these two factors, both perovskites give rise to similar conversions in the CO 2 reduction reaction, with slightly higher carbon product evolution over NaTaO 3 . Regarding structural aspects, the presence of a monoclinic phase in the NaTaO 3 sample may also play a role in its photocatalytic performance.According to the literature, 34 the monoclinic phase of NaTaO 3 leads to a Ta-O-Ta angle closer to 180, more favourable for charge delocalisation.In addition, some authors have proposed a positive effect of multi-phase NaTaO 3 samples for CH 4 evolution in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 . 15n additional interesting feature of these photocatalysts is their lower selectivity towards hydrogen with respect to TiO 2 , which suggests that these structures drive the competition between CO 2 and H 2 O for conduction band electrons towards the reduction of carbon dioxide.This result is especially remarkable in the case of NaTaO 3 , which also shows higher methane selectivity."}, {"llm generation": "NaNbO 3, NaTaO 3", "source": "NaNbO 3 and NaTaO 3 perovskite photocatalysts have been prepared by solid-state reactions, extensively characterised and tested for the reduction of CO 2 .", "context": "NaNbO 3 and NaTaO 3 perovskite photocatalysts have been prepared by solid-state reactions, extensively characterised and tested for the reduction of CO 2 .X-ray diffraction studies reveal the niobate material to be composed of an orthorhombically distorted perovskite structure, while the tantalate is mainly formed by a ca.4.5 : 1 combination of the orthorhombic and monoclinic modifications.In spite of their low surface area, both catalysts exhibit interesting intrinsic activities for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 under UV irradiation, with the tantalate material giving rise to a slightly higher performance attributed to a compromise situation between photogenerated electron-hole utilisation and the reducing potential of conduction band electrons.Interestingly, both NaNbO 3 and NaTaO 3 seem to drive the competition between CO 2 and H 2 O for conduction band electrons towards the reduction of carbon dioxide, as reflected by a lower selectivity to H 2 in the photocatalytic process.This result is especially remarkable in the case of sodium tantalate. a 5.504 a 5.480 a 3.889 a b 6.208 b 5.568 b 7.791 b 3.895 c 15.51 c 5.522 c 3.891 c 36.609 90.398Crystal size (nm) 178 160 165 200 Paper Photochemical Photobiological Sciences 1 m 2 g -1 .
