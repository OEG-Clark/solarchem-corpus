In a typical synthetic experiment.Firstly, 0.222 g of polyethylene oxidepolypropylene oxide-polyethylen (P123) (Pluronic, M 5800) was dissolved in 14.444 g of ethanol absolute, and this mixture was stirred continuously for 1 h.Secondly, deionized water was added to the mixture and stirred for another 1 h.Thirdly, 1.5 ml of ethylene glycol was added to the above mixture and stirred for another 2 h to form a clear solution.Finally, the solution was sealed and kept in a brown reagent bottle at least 48 h before using.The solution was named solution P. 0.444 g of WCl6 was added to 16.833 g solution P, and stirred for 20 min to obtain a yellow solution.The solution was then transferred to a 50 ml of Teflon-lined stainless autoclave to be kept under 110 o C for 3 h, and naturally cooled to room temperature.After the solvothermal treatment, the blue precipitate was washed with absolute ethanol, then dried in a vacuum oven at 80 C for 12 h.After that, the precipitate was ground to obtain powder.The powder was placed in a muffle furnace and calcined at 400 o C for 1 h to obtain a yellow sample, which was denoted as P-WO3.For comparison, we prepared H-WO3 by using the previously reported two-phase method 46. A series of FePc/P-WO3 samples were synthesized using a simple impregnation J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f method.Typically, 0.400 g P-WO3 was added to 10 ml absolute ethanol and stirred for 15 min, then the mixture was dispersed in ultrasound for 30 min.Certain amount of 0.040 g/L FePc solution was added to the above mixture in sequence, stirred for 15 min and ultrasonically dispersed for 30 min, respectively.After continuously stirring until dry at 80 o C, the catalysts were dried in a vacuum oven at 80 o C for 12 h.The catalysts were signed as XFePc/WO3 (X 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0), where X denoted as the mass fraction of FePc (FePc/(FePc P-WO3)).In addition, the samples named 0.8MPc/WO3 (M Co, Cu, Zn) were also synthesized followed the above method. The X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples were characterized with a Bruker D8 advance diffractometer, using Cu K radiation.The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of the samples was characterized with a Model Shimadzu UV2700 spectrophotometer, using BaSO4 as a reference.The Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of the samples were characterized with a Bruker Equinox 55 spectrometer, using KBr as diluents.Raman spectra were characterized with a Renishaw invia Confocal Raman spectrometer, a 785 nm laser as excitation source.The specific surface areas were obtained by N2 physisorption at -196 o C on a Micrometrics Tristar II 3020 analyzer using the Brunauer-Emment-Teller (BET) method.The samples were degassed under vacuum at 150 o C for 6 h and cooled in vacuum to room temperature before each analysis.The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was recorded on a Kratos-AXIS ULTRA DLD system, using a monochromatic Al K X-rays, the binding energy (BE) was calibrated internally by the adventitious C 1s peak at 284.4 eV.Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the samples were taken by a JEOLJEM-2010 electron microscope with an acceleration voltage of 200 kV.The steady-state surface photovoltage spectroscopy (SS-SPS) measurement of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f the samples was used with a home-built apparatus, the signals were collected with a lock-in amplier (SR830) synchronized with a light chopper (SR540), the monochromatic light was obtained with passing light from a 500W xenon lamp (CHF XQ500W) across a double prism monochromator (SBP300). Hydroxyl radicals (OH) are known to be important active species in photocatalytic reaction.In order to improve the sensitivity, coumarin as a labeled molecule was used to detect the content of hydroxyl radicals, the method is very effective.The hydroxyl radical test was as follows: 0.020 g of the catalyst was placed in 20 mL of coumarin solution at a concentration of 110 -3 M. The mixture was stirred for 10 min in the dark before the testing, to ensure that it reached the adsorptiondesorption equilibrium.After irradiation for 30 min, appropriate amount of the suspension was centrifuged in a 10 mL centrifuge tube and the supernatant was transferred into a Pyrex glass cell for the fluorescence measurement of 7hydroxycoumarin at 332 nm excitation wavelength with an emission wavelength at 460 nm through a spectrofluorometer (Perkin-Elmer LS55) 47 . A typical three-electrode system was used to measure photoelectrochemical (PEC) behavior.The prepared catalyst was used as working electrode, a platinum plate (99.9) was served as the counter electrode, a saturated KCl Ag/AgCl electrode was selected to use as the reference electrode, and 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution as the electrolyte.High purity nitrogen gas (99.999) was bubbled through the electrolyte before and during the experiment.The test was taken in a quartz cell using a 500 W xenon lamp with a cut-off filter ( 420 nm) as the illumination source.The samples were tested the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f photoelectrochemical performance by an IVIUM V13806 electrochemical workstation. The temperature of each experiment was kept at room temperature (about 25 C). Electrochemical (EC) measurements were carried out in the N2-bubbled and CO2 systems on the same conditions stated above. The CO2-temperature programmed desorption (CO2-TPD) measurements were carried out with 50 mg samples of the catalysts.Before the CO2-TPD measurement, the catalysts were purged at 300 C for 30 min under He (30 mLmin -1 ) flow and cooled to 30 C.The samples were then treated with pure CO2 (50 mLmin -1 ) for 30 min at 30 C. The physical adsorbed CO2 was purged with He (30 mLmin -1 ) for 1 h before running the TPD experiments.The sample was heated from 30 C to 550 C at a rate of 10 o C/min in a high purity He (30 mLmin -1 ).During the TPD experiments, the signal of m/e 28 was continuously monitored using quadrupole mass spectra (QIC-20, HIDEN). In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectra (In-situ DRIFTS) were collected from 650 cm -1 to 4000 cm -1 at a spectral resolution of 4 cm -1 with 16 scans on a FTIR spectrometer (Nicolet is50) equipped with a high-sensitive MCT detector cooled by liquid N2 and DRIFT cell (Harrick).Each sample was first put in a drying oven at 110 o C for 2 h, and then was purged with high purified N2 (30 mLmin - 1 ) at room temperature for 1 h in the in-situ tank, in order to eliminate the physical adsorbed water and other impurities, then the background spectra was recorded.The experiment of in-situ DRIFTS of CO2 H2O included the following steps.First step, 30 ml/min pure CO2 was introduced into H2O (L), then the mixture was through the sample surface for 30 min, the spectra of different time were recorded with subtracting from the background spectrum in dark conditions.The second step, the CO2 and H2O J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f (L) were turned off, then 30 ml/min pure N2 was introduced, the spectra of different time were recorded with subtracting from the background spectrum in simulated sunlight. In the photocatalytic reduction of CO2, 0.100 g of catalyst was scattered in 5 ml water contained in a cylindrical steel reactor with 100 mL volume and 3.5 cm 2 area. High purity CO2 gas was passed through water and then entered into the reaction device with stirred for 20 min.After that, the gas was turned off and continually stirred for another 10 min.The photocatalyst was allowed to equilibrate in the CO2/H2O system. A 300 W Xenon arc lamp was used as the light source followed by irradiation for 4 hours.Finish irradiation, extract 0.25 ml from the reaction cell at given time interval for CO and CH4 concentration analysis by a gas chromatograph (GC-7920, Beijing), and the O2 concentration was detected with a gas chromatograph (GC-7900, Beijing)."}, {"llm generation": "P-WO3", "source": "The P-WO3 exhibits about 3.3-fold high photocatalytic activity for reducing CO2 to CO and CH4 compared with the reported WO3.", "context": "In this work, P123 was used as a template to optimize the synthesis conditions for preparing P-WO3 with large specific surface area and high activity for CO2 reduction. The XRD patterns of P-WO3 prepared at different hydrothermal temperatures are illustrated in Fig. S1A.The typical peaks assigned to monoclinic phase of WO3 (JCPDS 32-1395) are observed over all samples 48 .With rising the hydrothermal temperature, the crystallinity of the sample prepared at 110 o C is better than that of at 90 o C, and there is no apparent difference between the sample prepared at As summarized in Table S1, it is found that the BET surface area of the sample prepared at 110 o C (112.8 m 2 .g - ) is higher than that of the sample prepared at 90 o C (82.9 m 2 .g - ) and 130 o C (105.3 m 2 .g - ).The results also indicate that 110 o C hydrothermal temperature is beneficial for increasing the BET surface area of the samples.Fig. S1B shows the adsorption of RhB over different P-WO3 prepared at different hydrothermal temperature, which reflects the surface area as shown in Table S1.S1, it is found that the BET surface area of the sample prepared by hydrothermal for 2 h (119.2 m 2 .g - ) is higher than that of the sample prepared by hydrothermal for 3 h (112.8 m 2 .g - ) and 4 h (89.2 m 2 .g - ).The results indicate that the BET surface area of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f the samples is decreased with increasing the hydrothermal time.The regular pattern of the BET surface area is agreement with the sequence of the adsorption of RhB over different P-WO3 prepared by different hydrothermal time (Fig. S2B).The BET surface area is larger, the adsorption capacity of RhB is stronger over WO3 prepared by different hydrothermal time. Fig. S2C shows that the amount of OH produced by the sample prepared by hydrothermal for 2 h is much lower than that of the sample prepared by hydrothermal for 3 h and 4 h.Especially for the sample prepared by hydrothermal for 3 h, which displays the strongest FS intensity.Simultaneously, the photocatalytic activity of the sample prepared by hydrothermal for 3 h is higher than that of other samples (Fig. S2D), which are well consistent with the results of hydroxyl radical test.Combined with the above results, the sample prepared by hydrothermal for 3 h exhibits the best charge separation, and the highest the photocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction.S1 that the BET surface area of the sample prepared by calcination at 350 o C is 115.8 m 2 .g - , which is similar with that of sample prepared by calcination at 400 o C (112.8 m 2 .g - ).However, when the calcination temperature reaches 450 o C, the BET surface area rapidly drops to 81.7 m 2 .g - .The results indicate that the BET surface area of the samples is decreased with increasing the calcination temperature.The regular pattern of the BET surface area is agreement with the sequence of the adsorption of RhB over different P-WO3 prepared by different calcination temperature (Fig. S3B).The BET surface area is larger, the adsorption capacity of RhB is stronger over P-WO3 prepared by different calcination temperature. In addition, the properties of charge separation and photocatalytic reduction of CO2 are researched, as shown in Fig. S3C and Fig. S3D.The regular pattern for the properties of charge separation is agreement with the sequence of the properties for photocatalytic reduction of CO2 over different P-WO3 prepared by different calcination temperature. The sample prepared by calcination at 400 o C shows the best properties of charge separation, which also displays the best activity for photocatalytic reduction of CO2. Considering the above results, it is confirmed that the optimized calcination temperature is 400 o C. Based on the preliminary results (Fig. S1-S3), it can be determined that the optimal reaction conditions for preparing P-WO3 are a reaction temperature of 110 o C, a reaction time of 3 h, and a calcination temperature of 400 o C. Compared with WO3 nanoplate prepared by the two-phase method 46 , the XRD patterns (Fig. S4) confirm that P-WO3 and WO3 both show monoclinic phase structures.Meanwhile, the N2 physisorption was tested and the results are shown in (Fig. 1A,B).It can be clearly seen that the N2 adsorption-desorption curve of P-WO3 shows a typical IV type isotherm, and the adsorption branch and desorption branch form a similar H3 type hysteresis loop, which may be caused by uneven slit holes in P-WO3 as shown in Fig. 1A.The corresponding pore size distribution is shown in Fig. 1B, the pore size of the P-WO3 sample is mainly distributed between 1.5-2.7 nm, which indicates that the P-WO3 sample has the mesoporous structure.Fig. 1(C-D) shows that the amount of produced OH and the photocatalytic activity of the P-WO3 and WO3.The signals of P-WO3 are stronger than that of WO3, which indicates that more OH is produced over P-WO3 than WO3.The P-WO3 exhibits about 3.3-fold high photocatalytic activity for reducing CO2 to CO and CH4 compared with the reported WO3.This is attributed to the increased surface area by creating pores in WO3. The XRD patterns of the P-WO3 and XFePc/P-WO3 are shown in Fig. S5A.After P-WO3 is modified with different content of FePc, no noticeable characteristic peaks of FePc are observed, and only monoclinic phase of WO3 (JCPDS 32-1395) are detected for all samples, which indicates that FePc with certain small amount is uniformly dispersed on the surfaces of P-WO3.The DRS of the samples are shown in Fig. S5B, the results show that the introduction of FePc does not change the absorption band edge of P-WO3, while there are strong absorption peaks in the region of 500-800 nm.As expected, the light absorption intensity is increased with increasing the amount of FePc. The results indicate that the introduction of FePc could expand the visible light absorption of P-WO3.The TEM image (Fig. 2A) reveals that P-WO3 is of irregular flaky structure.However, there is no obvious hole shape structure, indicating that there is a slit hole between sheets, which is consistent with the result of N2 adsorptiondesorption.The HRTEM image of P-WO3 is shown in Fig. 2B.The spacing of lattice fringes is about 0.379 nm and 0.397 nm, corresponding to the (020) and (002) plane of WO3 (monoclinic phase), respectively.The TEM image of 0.8FePc/P-WO3 nanocomposite confirms that the P-WO3 closely contacts with FePc (Fig. 2C,D), and the energy-dispersive Xray (EDX) elemental mapping images unambiguously demonstrate the uniform distribution of W, O, Fe and N elements (Fig. S6), indicating that FePc and P-WO3 are uniformly connected. To confirm the interfacial bonding mode of FePc and P-WO3, the traditional FT-IR spectra of FePc, P-WO3 and XFePc/P-WO3 samples were measured (Fig. 3A).A peak at 742 cm -1 is attributed to the asymmetric vibration of the W-O-W bonds 49 . Meanwhile, the peaks are observed at 1627 cm -1 and 3412 cm -1 , attributed to the O-H stretching vibration of the surface hydroxyl peak of P-WO3 50 .Noteworthy, the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f characteristic peaks (1085, 1122, 1174, 1289 and 1334 cm -1 ) of FePc are detected over XFePc/P-WO3 samples, which indicates that FePc and P-WO3 have been successfully combined.Interestingly, as the content of FePc increases, the surface hydroxyl peak intensity at 1627 cm -1 of XFePc/P-WO3 becomes weak, indicating that FePc might connect with P-WO3 by the surface hydroxyl group.As shown in Fig. 3B, the Raman peak at 273 cm -1 belongs to the bending vibration mode of O-W-O 51 , and the Raman peaks at 718 cm -1 and 814 cm -1 are ascribed to the stretching vibration mode of W-O 52,53 .It is noticed that there is a slight Raman shift along with a gradually strengthened intensities for O-W-O and W-O bonds with increasing the amount of FePc. Remarkably, it is found that the peak at 324 cm -1 of FePc is red-shifted, which could be caused by the connection between the nitrogen and hydrogen by forming W-O-H-N structure.In order to demonstrate that FePc connects with P-WO3 by the W-O-H-N structure, the XPS data were recorded.The XPS data indicates that the W4f binding energy of 0.8FePc/P-WO3 has a positive shift compared to that of P-WO3 (Fig. 3C and Fig. S7A).One can see that, the binding energy of Fe has no significant changes compared to that of pure FePc (Fig. S7B), while the binding energy of N1s has an obvious negative shift (Fig. 3D).Combined with the results of FT-IR spectra and Raman, it is deduced that FePc is connected with P-WO3 by linking to the N atoms in the ligand of FePc via H-bond interaction (W-O-H-N).Fig. 4A shows the SS-SPS responses of P-WO3 and XFePc/P-WO3 samples under air conditions.P-WO3 shows a low SPS signal, and with increasing the quantity of used FePc, the SPS signal gradually becomes strong.As for the 0.8FePc/P-WO3 sample, it displays the strongest SPS signal.However, the SPS signal begins to decrease if the amount of FePc continues to increase, indicating that it is much beneficial for the charge separation of P-WO3 to modify an appropriate amount of FePc.In order to verify the The effects of FePc modification on the photocatalytic activities of CO2 reduction of P-WO3 are explored under solar-simulated light (Fig. 4C).The main products of photocatalytic reduction of CO2 by P-WO3 and XFePc/P-WO3 can be seen from Fig. 4C, containing the reduced products (CH4, CO) and a certain amount of O2 as the oxidation product.As for 0.8FePc/P-WO3 sample, it shows the highest photocatalytic activities for CO2 reduction, which is about 2.5 times than that of P-WO3, and the activity of the 0.8FePc/P-WO3 is about 8-time higher than that of the reported WO3 nanoplate 46 .However, the photocatalytic activities for CO2 reduction decreases if the amount of FePc is too much, indicating that it is much beneficial for photocatalytic activities of CO2 reduction over P-WO3 to modify an appropriate amount of FePc. Combined with the SS-SPS responses and OH tests, it is concluded that the photocatalytic activities for CO2 reduction over P-WO3 and XFePc/P-WO3 mainly depend on the photogenerated charge transfer and separation.In addition, the optimized sample (0.8FePc/P-WO3) also displays good stability for 5 cycles during CO2 conversion, as shown in Fig. 4D.This also indicates that the observed reduction productions like CO and CH4 do not result from the fabricated photocatalysts.Moreover, all the designed experiments, mainly involved with the reactions in the presence of photocatalyst, CO2 and H2O in dark, with photocatalyst and H2O but without CO2 under J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f irradiation, and with CO2 and H2O but without photocatalyst under irradiation, show No CH4 and CO as the reduction production are detected.Hence, it is deduced that CO2 is really reduced with H2O to mainly produce CO and CH4. According to the energy band alignment of FePc and WO3, an effective Z-scheme photocatalytic system tends to be more reasonable.In order to confirm this, the following experiments are designed.The SPS responses of P-WO3 and 0.8FePc/P-WO3 are recorded in N2 atmosphere (Fig. 5A,B).There are no detectable SPS responses for both P-WO3 and 0.8FePc/P-WO3, indicating the weak charge transfer and separation under the monochromatic beam excitation.With an additional 660 nm monochromatic excitation beam, 0.8FePc/P-WO3 exhibits a detectable SPS response in the range of 300-400 nm.As shown in the DRS (Fig. S5B), the coated FePc responses to the light adsorption between 500-800 nm, and P-WO3 absorb light at wavelength smaller than 450 nm.As expected, with the auxiliary excitation of 405 monochromatic excitation beam, an obvious SPS response is detected in the range of 630-780nm.Thus, it is clear that the SPS signals could be detected only if FePc and P-WO3 are excited simultaneously, naturally obeying a Z-scheme charge transfer mechanism.In other words, the photogenerated electrons in the CB of WO3 could recombine with the holes in the HOMO of FePc so as to enhance the charge separation on the fabricated 0.8FePc/P-WO3 nanocomposite. The monochromatic photocurrent tests are used to further verify the proposed Zscheme transfer mechanism over three samples of FePc, P-WO3 and 0.8FePc/P-WO3 (Fig. 5C).The photocurrent density of FePc and 0.8FePc/P-WO3 gradually increases as the excitation wavelength decreases from 750 to 600 nm, and no photocurrent density of P-WO3 is detected.This illustrates that FePc is excited in the range of 600-700 nm, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f consistent with its specific absorption.As the excitation wavelength decreases from 450 to 400 nm, the photocurrent density of P-WO3 and 0.8FePc/P-WO3 gradually increases, and no photocurrent density of FePc is detected.This illustrates that P-WO3 is excited in the range of 400-450 nm, consistent with its specific absorption.Noticeably, the photocurrent density of 0.8FePc/P-WO3 obeys the similar law with pure P-WO3 and FePc on the corresponding excitation wavelengths.In this case, there is weak or no charge transfer and separation due to the single excitation of P-WO3 or FePc.However, when 0.8FePc/P-WO3 is excited by 660 nm monochromatic light at the same time, the photocurrent density of the 0.8FePc/P-WO3 is increased rapidly from 450 nm to 400 nm.It is worthy of noting that the photocurrent density is much higher than that of the sum of individual excitation of FePc and P-WO3.The rapid increase in photocurrent density is ascribed to the Z-scheme mechanism on the photoinduced charge transfer and separation. To further verify the Z-scheme photogenerated charge transfer mechanism, a single-wavelength hydroxyl radical tests were also performed on the optimal sample 0.8FePc/P-WO3.The normalized fluorescence spectra related to the formed hydroxyl radicals under 660 nm, 405 nm and double excitation (660 nm 405 nm) are shown in Fig. 5D.When 0.8FePc/P-WO3 is excited at the excitation wavelength of 405 nm and 660 nm respectively, a weak signal will be generated in the corresponding fluorescence spectrum.Considering that FePc and P-WO3 in 0.8FePc/P-WO3 composite are excited separately, so that the resulting signal is weak.Interestingly, when the excitation wavelengths of 660 nm and 405 nm are used simultaneously, a special higher signal is detected.And the intensity of the signal based on 0.8FePc/P-WO3 is much higher than the sum of the signals based on FePc and P-WO3, respectively.This further indicates that the charge transfer and separation in 0.8FePc/P-WO3 depends on the Z-scheme J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f mechanism. In addition, the photocatalytic activities for CO2 conversion over 0.8FePc/P-WO3 are carried out under 660 nm and 405 nm monochromatic light irradiation (Fig. S8). The photocatalytic activities of 660 nm and 405 nm monochromatic light respective irradiation is lower than that of 660 nm and 405 nm simultaneous one.The results are consistent with those of the single-wavelength hydroxyl radical tests.In order to verify the catalytic function of the coordination metal in FePc, the electrochemical reduction tests are carried over P-WO3, 0.8H2Pc/P-WO3 and 0.8FePc/P-WO3 samples under the N2-and CO2-bubbling systems, as shown in Fig. 6A and6B.The results show that P-WO3 and 0.8H2Pc/P-WO3 have similar onset potentials in the N2-and CO2-bubbling systems, while 0.8FePc/P-WO3 has the low reduction potential, especially in the presence of CO2, indicating that the central metal in FePc has a marked catalytic effect on the CO2 reduction reaction.In other words, CO2 is more easily reduced over 0.8FePc/P-WO3.Moreover, a series of controllable experiments are designed to further confirm whether the central metal of FePc could play an important role in catalyzing the reduction of CO2, as shown in Fig. S9.The SS-SPS responses and FS spectra are carried on P-WO3, 0.8H2Pc/P-WO3 and 0.8FePc/P-WO3.The SS-SPS responses and FS spectra both follow the orders: P-WO3 0.8H2Pc/P-WO3 0.8FePc/P-WO3 (Fig. S9A,B), which is in agreement with the photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity (Fig. S9C). This indicates that the central metal of FePc could catalyze the reduction reactions of CO2.In addition, the CO2-TPD curves are measured as presented in Fig. S10.One can see only one desorption peak appears in the temperature range from 180 C to 330 C for P-WO3 and 0.8FePc/P-WO3, corresponding to the CO2 desorption.There is noticeable difference in the temperature of peak between the samples, which indicates that the adsorption of CO2 on P-WO3 (230.7 o C) is influenced greatly by FePc (247.9 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f o C for 0.8FePc/P-WO3).It is noticed that the corresponding area of the desorption peak of CO2 over 0.8FePc/P-WO3 is larger than that of P-WO3.The results suggest that the modified FePc is beneficial for promoting the adsorption of CO2.Generally, a high adsorption capacity for CO2 leads to a high reactivity.The yield of CO and CH4 on P-WO3 and 0.8FePc/P-WO3 (Fig. 4C) is closely related to the CO2 adsorption capacity. The CO2 H2O adsorptions of the P-WO3 and 0.8FePc/P-WO3 samples were investigated by in-situ DRIFTS at room temperature, as showed in Fig. 6C.For this, the sample was purged firstly with CO2 gas in advance of passing through H2O for 30 min, and then with high purified N2 for 1 h.The experimental data of each stage were recorded, and the DRIFTS spectra were obtained by subtracting the background spectrum.Several vibration bands can be observed in the range of 3550-3750 cm -1 (3727, 3706, 3627 and 3599 cm -1 ), ascribed to the surface O-H stretching of H2O 50 . The peak strength of O-H stretching is similar over P-WO3 and 0.8FePc/P-WO3, which indicates that the introduction of FePc has no effect on the adsorption of H2O.The bands in the range of 2280-2390 cm -1 assigned to the asymmetric stretching vibration of CO2.Interestingly, When the samples adsorbed CO2 and H2O for 30 minutes, the characteristic peaks of CO2 over 0.8FePc/P-WO3 is higher than that of over P-WO3, which indicates that the introduction of FePc is favorable for CO2 adsorption, which is consistent with the results of CO2-TPD.To further study the reactivity of adsorbed CO2 and H2O, in-situ DRIFTS were also recorded as a function of time over WO3 and 0.8FePc/P-WO3 after irradiation for 15 min.One can see the strength of O-H stretching over 0.8FePc/P-WO3 is smaller than that of P-WO3, accompanying the lower adsorption signal for CO2.0.8FePc/P-WO3 displays excellent performance for CO2 reduction, which is not only due to FePc's good CO2 adsorption performance, but also due to the novel Z-scheme transfer process proved by the above results."}, {"llm generation": "0.8FePc/P-WO3 nanocomposites", "source": "In summary, the well-designed 0.8FePc/P-WO3 nanocomposites exhibit excellent photocatalytic activities for CO2 conversion under solar-simulated light, thanks to a novel Z-scheme charge-transfer mechanism.", "context": "In summary, the well-designed 0.8FePc/P-WO3 nanocomposites exhibit excellent photocatalytic activities for CO2 conversion under solar-simulated light, thanks to a novel Z-scheme charge-transfer mechanism.The excellent activities are attributed to the high specific surface area, enhanced charge separation and extended visible light absorption.At the same time, the transferred electrons from ligand to central metal cation can empower the catalytic function of Fe 2 for CO2 reduction.Similarly, the photocatalytic activities of P-WO3 could be also improved after coupling with other J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f MPc.Among the designed MPc/P-WO3 nanocomposites, the 0.8FePc/P-WO3 exhibits the optimal activity for CO2 reduction, with about 8-fold high photocatalytic activity for reducing CO2 to CO and CH4 compared with the reported WO3 nanoplate with high photoactivity, which is attributed to the synergistic effects of high specific surface area, the better charge separation and preferable catalytic role of central metal cation. Accordingly, this work develops not only a skillful strategy for WO3-based photocatalytic nanomaterials with wide-visible-light response, but also a new route for a cascade Z-scheme photocatalytic system to produce efficiently solar fuels. 110 o C and the sample prepared at 130 o C. The characteristic diffraction peaks of the sample prepared at 110 o C is well consistent with monoclinic phase of WO3 (JCPDS 32-1395).The result J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f shows that the monoclinic phase of WO3 is prepared in the condition of 110 o C hydrothermal temperature.

In a typical synthetic experiment.Firstly, 0.222 g of polyethylene oxidepolypropylene oxide-polyethylen (P123) (Pluronic, M 5800) was dissolved in 14.444 g of ethanol absolute, and this mixture was stirred continuously for 1 h.Secondly, deionized water was added to the mixture and stirred for another 1 h.Thirdly, 1.5 ml of ethylene glycol was added to the above mixture and stirred for another 2 h to form a clear solution.Finally, the solution was sealed and kept in a brown reagent bottle at least 48 h before using.The solution was named solution P. 0.444 g of WCl6 was added to 16.833 g solution P, and stirred for 20 min to obtain a yellow solution.The solution was then transferred to a 50 ml of Teflon-lined stainless autoclave to be kept under 110 o C for 3 h, and naturally cooled to room temperature.After the solvothermal treatment, the blue precipitate was washed with absolute ethanol, then dried in a vacuum oven at 80 C for 12 h.After that, the precipitate was ground to obtain powder.The powder was placed in a muffle furnace and calcined at 400 o C for 1 h to obtain a yellow sample, which was denoted as P-WO3.For comparison, we prepared H-WO3 by using the previously reported two-phase method 46. A series of FePc/P-WO3 samples were synthesized using a simple impregnation J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f method.Typically, 0.400 g P-WO3 was added to 10 ml absolute ethanol and stirred for 15 min, then the mixture was dispersed in ultrasound for 30 min.Certain amount of 0.040 g/L FePc solution was added to the above mixture in sequence, stirred for 15 min and ultrasonically dispersed for 30 min, respectively.After continuously stirring until dry at 80 o C, the catalysts were dried in a vacuum oven at 80 o C for 12 h.The catalysts were signed as XFePc/WO3 (X 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0), where X denoted as the mass fraction of FePc (FePc/(FePc P-WO3)).In addition, the samples named 0.8MPc/WO3 (M Co, Cu, Zn) were also synthesized followed the above method. The X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples were characterized with a Bruker D8 advance diffractometer, using Cu K radiation.The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of the samples was characterized with a Model Shimadzu UV2700 spectrophotometer, using BaSO4 as a reference.The Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of the samples were characterized with a Bruker Equinox 55 spectrometer, using KBr as diluents.Raman spectra were characterized with a Renishaw invia Confocal Raman spectrometer, a 785 nm laser as excitation source.The specific surface areas were obtained by N2 physisorption at -196 o C on a Micrometrics Tristar II 3020 analyzer using the Brunauer-Emment-Teller (BET) method.The samples were degassed under vacuum at 150 o C for 6 h and cooled in vacuum to room temperature before each analysis.The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was recorded on a Kratos-AXIS ULTRA DLD system, using a monochromatic Al K X-rays, the binding energy (BE) was calibrated internally by the adventitious C 1s peak at 284.4 eV.Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the samples were taken by a JEOLJEM-2010 electron microscope with an acceleration voltage of 200 kV.The steady-state surface photovoltage spectroscopy (SS-SPS) measurement of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f the samples was used with a home-built apparatus, the signals were collected with a lock-in amplier (SR830) synchronized with a light chopper (SR540), the monochromatic light was obtained with passing light from a 500W xenon lamp (CHF XQ500W) across a double prism monochromator (SBP300). Hydroxyl radicals (OH) are known to be important active species in photocatalytic reaction.In order to improve the sensitivity, coumarin as a labeled molecule was used to detect the content of hydroxyl radicals, the method is very effective.The hydroxyl radical test was as follows: 0.020 g of the catalyst was placed in 20 mL of coumarin solution at a concentration of 110 -3 M. The mixture was stirred for 10 min in the dark before the testing, to ensure that it reached the adsorptiondesorption equilibrium.After irradiation for 30 min, appropriate amount of the suspension was centrifuged in a 10 mL centrifuge tube and the supernatant was transferred into a Pyrex glass cell for the fluorescence measurement of 7hydroxycoumarin at 332 nm excitation wavelength with an emission wavelength at 460 nm through a spectrofluorometer (Perkin-Elmer LS55) 47 . A typical three-electrode system was used to measure photoelectrochemical (PEC) behavior.The prepared catalyst was used as working electrode, a platinum plate (99.9) was served as the counter electrode, a saturated KCl Ag/AgCl electrode was selected to use as the reference electrode, and 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution as the electrolyte.High purity nitrogen gas (99.999) was bubbled through the electrolyte before and during the experiment.The test was taken in a quartz cell using a 500 W xenon lamp with a cut-off filter ( 420 nm) as the illumination source.The samples were tested the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f photoelectrochemical performance by an IVIUM V13806 electrochemical workstation. The temperature of each experiment was kept at room temperature (about 25 C). Electrochemical (EC) measurements were carried out in the N2-bubbled and CO2 systems on the same conditions stated above. The CO2-temperature programmed desorption (CO2-TPD) measurements were carried out with 50 mg samples of the catalysts.Before the CO2-TPD measurement, the catalysts were purged at 300 C for 30 min under He (30 mLmin -1 ) flow and cooled to 30 C.The samples were then treated with pure CO2 (50 mLmin -1 ) for 30 min at 30 C. The physical adsorbed CO2 was purged with He (30 mLmin -1 ) for 1 h before running the TPD experiments.The sample was heated from 30 C to 550 C at a rate of 10 o C/min in a high purity He (30 mLmin -1 ).During the TPD experiments, the signal of m/e 28 was continuously monitored using quadrupole mass spectra (QIC-20, HIDEN). In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectra (In-situ DRIFTS) were collected from 650 cm -1 to 4000 cm -1 at a spectral resolution of 4 cm -1 with 16 scans on a FTIR spectrometer (Nicolet is50) equipped with a high-sensitive MCT detector cooled by liquid N2 and DRIFT cell (Harrick).Each sample was first put in a drying oven at 110 o C for 2 h, and then was purged with high purified N2 (30 mLmin - 1 ) at room temperature for 1 h in the in-situ tank, in order to eliminate the physical adsorbed water and other impurities, then the background spectra was recorded.The experiment of in-situ DRIFTS of CO2 H2O included the following steps.First step, 30 ml/min pure CO2 was introduced into H2O (L), then the mixture was through the sample surface for 30 min, the spectra of different time were recorded with subtracting from the background spectrum in dark conditions.The second step, the CO2 and H2O J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f (L) were turned off, then 30 ml/min pure N2 was introduced, the spectra of different time were recorded with subtracting from the background spectrum in simulated sunlight. In the photocatalytic reduction of CO2, 0.100 g of catalyst was scattered in 5 ml water contained in a cylindrical steel reactor with 100 mL volume and 3.5 cm 2 area. High purity CO2 gas was passed through water and then entered into the reaction device with stirred for 20 min.After that, the gas was turned off and continually stirred for another 10 min.The photocatalyst was allowed to equilibrate in the CO2/H2O system. A 300 W Xenon arc lamp was used as the light source followed by irradiation for 4 hours.Finish irradiation, extract 0.25 ml from the reaction cell at given time interval for CO and CH4 concentration analysis by a gas chromatograph (GC-7920, Beijing), and the O2 concentration was detected with a gas chromatograph (GC-7900, Beijing)."}, {"llm generation": "Solar Simulator", "source": "The effects of FePc modification on the photocatalytic activities of CO2 reduction of P-WO3 are explored under solar-simulated light (Fig. 4C).", "context": "In this work, P123 was used as a template to optimize the synthesis conditions for preparing P-WO3 with large specific surface area and high activity for CO2 reduction. The XRD patterns of P-WO3 prepared at different hydrothermal temperatures are illustrated in Fig. S1A.The typical peaks assigned to monoclinic phase of WO3 (JCPDS 32-1395) are observed over all samples 48 .With rising the hydrothermal temperature, the crystallinity of the sample prepared at 110 o C is better than that of at 90 o C, and there is no apparent difference between the sample prepared at As summarized in Table S1, it is found that the BET surface area of the sample prepared at 110 o C (112.8 m 2 .g - ) is higher than that of the sample prepared at 90 o C (82.9 m 2 .g - ) and 130 o C (105.3 m 2 .g - ).The results also indicate that 110 o C hydrothermal temperature is beneficial for increasing the BET surface area of the samples.Fig. S1B shows the adsorption of RhB over different P-WO3 prepared at different hydrothermal temperature, which reflects the surface area as shown in Table S1.S1, it is found that the BET surface area of the sample prepared by hydrothermal for 2 h (119.2 m 2 .g - ) is higher than that of the sample prepared by hydrothermal for 3 h (112.8 m 2 .g - ) and 4 h (89.2 m 2 .g - ).The results indicate that the BET surface area of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f the samples is decreased with increasing the hydrothermal time.The regular pattern of the BET surface area is agreement with the sequence of the adsorption of RhB over different P-WO3 prepared by different hydrothermal time (Fig. S2B).The BET surface area is larger, the adsorption capacity of RhB is stronger over WO3 prepared by different hydrothermal time. Fig. S2C shows that the amount of OH produced by the sample prepared by hydrothermal for 2 h is much lower than that of the sample prepared by hydrothermal for 3 h and 4 h.Especially for the sample prepared by hydrothermal for 3 h, which displays the strongest FS intensity.Simultaneously, the photocatalytic activity of the sample prepared by hydrothermal for 3 h is higher than that of other samples (Fig. S2D), which are well consistent with the results of hydroxyl radical test.Combined with the above results, the sample prepared by hydrothermal for 3 h exhibits the best charge separation, and the highest the photocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction.S1 that the BET surface area of the sample prepared by calcination at 350 o C is 115.8 m 2 .g - , which is similar with that of sample prepared by calcination at 400 o C (112.8 m 2 .g - ).However, when the calcination temperature reaches 450 o C, the BET surface area rapidly drops to 81.7 m 2 .g - .The results indicate that the BET surface area of the samples is decreased with increasing the calcination temperature.The regular pattern of the BET surface area is agreement with the sequence of the adsorption of RhB over different P-WO3 prepared by different calcination temperature (Fig. S3B).The BET surface area is larger, the adsorption capacity of RhB is stronger over P-WO3 prepared by different calcination temperature. In addition, the properties of charge separation and photocatalytic reduction of CO2 are researched, as shown in Fig. S3C and Fig. S3D.The regular pattern for the properties of charge separation is agreement with the sequence of the properties for photocatalytic reduction of CO2 over different P-WO3 prepared by different calcination temperature. The sample prepared by calcination at 400 o C shows the best properties of charge separation, which also displays the best activity for photocatalytic reduction of CO2. Considering the above results, it is confirmed that the optimized calcination temperature is 400 o C. Based on the preliminary results (Fig. S1-S3), it can be determined that the optimal reaction conditions for preparing P-WO3 are a reaction temperature of 110 o C, a reaction time of 3 h, and a calcination temperature of 400 o C. Compared with WO3 nanoplate prepared by the two-phase method 46 , the XRD patterns (Fig. S4) confirm that P-WO3 and WO3 both show monoclinic phase structures.Meanwhile, the N2 physisorption was tested and the results are shown in (Fig. 1A,B).It can be clearly seen that the N2 adsorption-desorption curve of P-WO3 shows a typical IV type isotherm, and the adsorption branch and desorption branch form a similar H3 type hysteresis loop, which may be caused by uneven slit holes in P-WO3 as shown in Fig. 1A.The corresponding pore size distribution is shown in Fig. 1B, the pore size of the P-WO3 sample is mainly distributed between 1.5-2.7 nm, which indicates that the P-WO3 sample has the mesoporous structure.Fig. 1(C-D) shows that the amount of produced OH and the photocatalytic activity of the P-WO3 and WO3.The signals of P-WO3 are stronger than that of WO3, which indicates that more OH is produced over P-WO3 than WO3.The P-WO3 exhibits about 3.3-fold high photocatalytic activity for reducing CO2 to CO and CH4 compared with the reported WO3.This is attributed to the increased surface area by creating pores in WO3. The XRD patterns of the P-WO3 and XFePc/P-WO3 are shown in Fig. S5A.After P-WO3 is modified with different content of FePc, no noticeable characteristic peaks of FePc are observed, and only monoclinic phase of WO3 (JCPDS 32-1395) are detected for all samples, which indicates that FePc with certain small amount is uniformly dispersed on the surfaces of P-WO3.The DRS of the samples are shown in Fig. S5B, the results show that the introduction of FePc does not change the absorption band edge of P-WO3, while there are strong absorption peaks in the region of 500-800 nm.As expected, the light absorption intensity is increased with increasing the amount of FePc. The results indicate that the introduction of FePc could expand the visible light absorption of P-WO3.The TEM image (Fig. 2A) reveals that P-WO3 is of irregular flaky structure.However, there is no obvious hole shape structure, indicating that there is a slit hole between sheets, which is consistent with the result of N2 adsorptiondesorption.The HRTEM image of P-WO3 is shown in Fig. 2B.The spacing of lattice fringes is about 0.379 nm and 0.397 nm, corresponding to the (020) and (002) plane of WO3 (monoclinic phase), respectively.The TEM image of 0.8FePc/P-WO3 nanocomposite confirms that the P-WO3 closely contacts with FePc (Fig. 2C,D), and the energy-dispersive Xray (EDX) elemental mapping images unambiguously demonstrate the uniform distribution of W, O, Fe and N elements (Fig. S6), indicating that FePc and P-WO3 are uniformly connected. To confirm the interfacial bonding mode of FePc and P-WO3, the traditional FT-IR spectra of FePc, P-WO3 and XFePc/P-WO3 samples were measured (Fig. 3A).A peak at 742 cm -1 is attributed to the asymmetric vibration of the W-O-W bonds 49 . Meanwhile, the peaks are observed at 1627 cm -1 and 3412 cm -1 , attributed to the O-H stretching vibration of the surface hydroxyl peak of P-WO3 50 .Noteworthy, the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f characteristic peaks (1085, 1122, 1174, 1289 and 1334 cm -1 ) of FePc are detected over XFePc/P-WO3 samples, which indicates that FePc and P-WO3 have been successfully combined.Interestingly, as the content of FePc increases, the surface hydroxyl peak intensity at 1627 cm -1 of XFePc/P-WO3 becomes weak, indicating that FePc might connect with P-WO3 by the surface hydroxyl group.As shown in Fig. 3B, the Raman peak at 273 cm -1 belongs to the bending vibration mode of O-W-O 51 , and the Raman peaks at 718 cm -1 and 814 cm -1 are ascribed to the stretching vibration mode of W-O 52,53 .It is noticed that there is a slight Raman shift along with a gradually strengthened intensities for O-W-O and W-O bonds with increasing the amount of FePc. Remarkably, it is found that the peak at 324 cm -1 of FePc is red-shifted, which could be caused by the connection between the nitrogen and hydrogen by forming W-O-H-N structure.In order to demonstrate that FePc connects with P-WO3 by the W-O-H-N structure, the XPS data were recorded.The XPS data indicates that the W4f binding energy of 0.8FePc/P-WO3 has a positive shift compared to that of P-WO3 (Fig. 3C and Fig. S7A).One can see that, the binding energy of Fe has no significant changes compared to that of pure FePc (Fig. S7B), while the binding energy of N1s has an obvious negative shift (Fig. 3D).Combined with the results of FT-IR spectra and Raman, it is deduced that FePc is connected with P-WO3 by linking to the N atoms in the ligand of FePc via H-bond interaction (W-O-H-N).Fig. 4A shows the SS-SPS responses of P-WO3 and XFePc/P-WO3 samples under air conditions.P-WO3 shows a low SPS signal, and with increasing the quantity of used FePc, the SPS signal gradually becomes strong.As for the 0.8FePc/P-WO3 sample, it displays the strongest SPS signal.However, the SPS signal begins to decrease if the amount of FePc continues to increase, indicating that it is much beneficial for the charge separation of P-WO3 to modify an appropriate amount of FePc.In order to verify the The effects of FePc modification on the photocatalytic activities of CO2 reduction of P-WO3 are explored under solar-simulated light (Fig. 4C).The main products of photocatalytic reduction of CO2 by P-WO3 and XFePc/P-WO3 can be seen from Fig. 4C, containing the reduced products (CH4, CO) and a certain amount of O2 as the oxidation product.As for 0.8FePc/P-WO3 sample, it shows the highest photocatalytic activities for CO2 reduction, which is about 2.5 times than that of P-WO3, and the activity of the 0.8FePc/P-WO3 is about 8-time higher than that of the reported WO3 nanoplate 46 .However, the photocatalytic activities for CO2 reduction decreases if the amount of FePc is too much, indicating that it is much beneficial for photocatalytic activities of CO2 reduction over P-WO3 to modify an appropriate amount of FePc. Combined with the SS-SPS responses and OH tests, it is concluded that the photocatalytic activities for CO2 reduction over P-WO3 and XFePc/P-WO3 mainly depend on the photogenerated charge transfer and separation.In addition, the optimized sample (0.8FePc/P-WO3) also displays good stability for 5 cycles during CO2 conversion, as shown in Fig. 4D.This also indicates that the observed reduction productions like CO and CH4 do not result from the fabricated photocatalysts.Moreover, all the designed experiments, mainly involved with the reactions in the presence of photocatalyst, CO2 and H2O in dark, with photocatalyst and H2O but without CO2 under J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f irradiation, and with CO2 and H2O but without photocatalyst under irradiation, show No CH4 and CO as the reduction production are detected.Hence, it is deduced that CO2 is really reduced with H2O to mainly produce CO and CH4. According to the energy band alignment of FePc and WO3, an effective Z-scheme photocatalytic system tends to be more reasonable.In order to confirm this, the following experiments are designed.The SPS responses of P-WO3 and 0.8FePc/P-WO3 are recorded in N2 atmosphere (Fig. 5A,B).There are no detectable SPS responses for both P-WO3 and 0.8FePc/P-WO3, indicating the weak charge transfer and separation under the monochromatic beam excitation.With an additional 660 nm monochromatic excitation beam, 0.8FePc/P-WO3 exhibits a detectable SPS response in the range of 300-400 nm.As shown in the DRS (Fig. S5B), the coated FePc responses to the light adsorption between 500-800 nm, and P-WO3 absorb light at wavelength smaller than 450 nm.As expected, with the auxiliary excitation of 405 monochromatic excitation beam, an obvious SPS response is detected in the range of 630-780nm.Thus, it is clear that the SPS signals could be detected only if FePc and P-WO3 are excited simultaneously, naturally obeying a Z-scheme charge transfer mechanism.In other words, the photogenerated electrons in the CB of WO3 could recombine with the holes in the HOMO of FePc so as to enhance the charge separation on the fabricated 0.8FePc/P-WO3 nanocomposite. The monochromatic photocurrent tests are used to further verify the proposed Zscheme transfer mechanism over three samples of FePc, P-WO3 and 0.8FePc/P-WO3 (Fig. 5C).The photocurrent density of FePc and 0.8FePc/P-WO3 gradually increases as the excitation wavelength decreases from 750 to 600 nm, and no photocurrent density of P-WO3 is detected.This illustrates that FePc is excited in the range of 600-700 nm, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f consistent with its specific absorption.As the excitation wavelength decreases from 450 to 400 nm, the photocurrent density of P-WO3 and 0.8FePc/P-WO3 gradually increases, and no photocurrent density of FePc is detected.This illustrates that P-WO3 is excited in the range of 400-450 nm, consistent with its specific absorption.Noticeably, the photocurrent density of 0.8FePc/P-WO3 obeys the similar law with pure P-WO3 and FePc on the corresponding excitation wavelengths.In this case, there is weak or no charge transfer and separation due to the single excitation of P-WO3 or FePc.However, when 0.8FePc/P-WO3 is excited by 660 nm monochromatic light at the same time, the photocurrent density of the 0.8FePc/P-WO3 is increased rapidly from 450 nm to 400 nm.It is worthy of noting that the photocurrent density is much higher than that of the sum of individual excitation of FePc and P-WO3.The rapid increase in photocurrent density is ascribed to the Z-scheme mechanism on the photoinduced charge transfer and separation. To further verify the Z-scheme photogenerated charge transfer mechanism, a single-wavelength hydroxyl radical tests were also performed on the optimal sample 0.8FePc/P-WO3.The normalized fluorescence spectra related to the formed hydroxyl radicals under 660 nm, 405 nm and double excitation (660 nm 405 nm) are shown in Fig. 5D.When 0.8FePc/P-WO3 is excited at the excitation wavelength of 405 nm and 660 nm respectively, a weak signal will be generated in the corresponding fluorescence spectrum.Considering that FePc and P-WO3 in 0.8FePc/P-WO3 composite are excited separately, so that the resulting signal is weak.Interestingly, when the excitation wavelengths of 660 nm and 405 nm are used simultaneously, a special higher signal is detected.And the intensity of the signal based on 0.8FePc/P-WO3 is much higher than the sum of the signals based on FePc and P-WO3, respectively.This further indicates that the charge transfer and separation in 0.8FePc/P-WO3 depends on the Z-scheme J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f mechanism. In addition, the photocatalytic activities for CO2 conversion over 0.8FePc/P-WO3 are carried out under 660 nm and 405 nm monochromatic light irradiation (Fig. S8). The photocatalytic activities of 660 nm and 405 nm monochromatic light respective irradiation is lower than that of 660 nm and 405 nm simultaneous one.The results are consistent with those of the single-wavelength hydroxyl radical tests.In order to verify the catalytic function of the coordination metal in FePc, the electrochemical reduction tests are carried over P-WO3, 0.8H2Pc/P-WO3 and 0.8FePc/P-WO3 samples under the N2-and CO2-bubbling systems, as shown in Fig. 6A and6B.The results show that P-WO3 and 0.8H2Pc/P-WO3 have similar onset potentials in the N2-and CO2-bubbling systems, while 0.8FePc/P-WO3 has the low reduction potential, especially in the presence of CO2, indicating that the central metal in FePc has a marked catalytic effect on the CO2 reduction reaction.In other words, CO2 is more easily reduced over 0.8FePc/P-WO3.Moreover, a series of controllable experiments are designed to further confirm whether the central metal of FePc could play an important role in catalyzing the reduction of CO2, as shown in Fig. S9.The SS-SPS responses and FS spectra are carried on P-WO3, 0.8H2Pc/P-WO3 and 0.8FePc/P-WO3.The SS-SPS responses and FS spectra both follow the orders: P-WO3 0.8H2Pc/P-WO3 0.8FePc/P-WO3 (Fig. S9A,B), which is in agreement with the photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity (Fig. S9C). This indicates that the central metal of FePc could catalyze the reduction reactions of CO2.In addition, the CO2-TPD curves are measured as presented in Fig. S10.One can see only one desorption peak appears in the temperature range from 180 C to 330 C for P-WO3 and 0.8FePc/P-WO3, corresponding to the CO2 desorption.There is noticeable difference in the temperature of peak between the samples, which indicates that the adsorption of CO2 on P-WO3 (230.7 o C) is influenced greatly by FePc (247.9 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f o C for 0.8FePc/P-WO3).It is noticed that the corresponding area of the desorption peak of CO2 over 0.8FePc/P-WO3 is larger than that of P-WO3.The results suggest that the modified FePc is beneficial for promoting the adsorption of CO2.Generally, a high adsorption capacity for CO2 leads to a high reactivity.The yield of CO and CH4 on P-WO3 and 0.8FePc/P-WO3 (Fig. 4C) is closely related to the CO2 adsorption capacity. The CO2 H2O adsorptions of the P-WO3 and 0.8FePc/P-WO3 samples were investigated by in-situ DRIFTS at room temperature, as showed in Fig. 6C.For this, the sample was purged firstly with CO2 gas in advance of passing through H2O for 30 min, and then with high purified N2 for 1 h.The experimental data of each stage were recorded, and the DRIFTS spectra were obtained by subtracting the background spectrum.Several vibration bands can be observed in the range of 3550-3750 cm -1 (3727, 3706, 3627 and 3599 cm -1 ), ascribed to the surface O-H stretching of H2O 50 . The peak strength of O-H stretching is similar over P-WO3 and 0.8FePc/P-WO3, which indicates that the introduction of FePc has no effect on the adsorption of H2O.The bands in the range of 2280-2390 cm -1 assigned to the asymmetric stretching vibration of CO2.Interestingly, When the samples adsorbed CO2 and H2O for 30 minutes, the characteristic peaks of CO2 over 0.8FePc/P-WO3 is higher than that of over P-WO3, which indicates that the introduction of FePc is favorable for CO2 adsorption, which is consistent with the results of CO2-TPD.To further study the reactivity of adsorbed CO2 and H2O, in-situ DRIFTS were also recorded as a function of time over WO3 and 0.8FePc/P-WO3 after irradiation for 15 min.One can see the strength of O-H stretching over 0.8FePc/P-WO3 is smaller than that of P-WO3, accompanying the lower adsorption signal for CO2.0.8FePc/P-WO3 displays excellent performance for CO2 reduction, which is not only due to FePc's good CO2 adsorption performance, but also due to the novel Z-scheme transfer process proved by the above results."}, {"llm generation": "Solar Simulator", "source": "In summary, the well-designed 0.8FePc/P-WO3 nanocomposites exhibit excellent photocatalytic activities for CO2 conversion under solar-simulated light, thanks to a novel Z-scheme charge-transfer mechanism.", "context": "In summary, the well-designed 0.8FePc/P-WO3 nanocomposites exhibit excellent photocatalytic activities for CO2 conversion under solar-simulated light, thanks to a novel Z-scheme charge-transfer mechanism.The excellent activities are attributed to the high specific surface area, enhanced charge separation and extended visible light absorption.At the same time, the transferred electrons from ligand to central metal cation can empower the catalytic function of Fe 2 for CO2 reduction.Similarly, the photocatalytic activities of P-WO3 could be also improved after coupling with other J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f MPc.Among the designed MPc/P-WO3 nanocomposites, the 0.8FePc/P-WO3 exhibits the optimal activity for CO2 reduction, with about 8-fold high photocatalytic activity for reducing CO2 to CO and CH4 compared with the reported WO3 nanoplate with high photoactivity, which is attributed to the synergistic effects of high specific surface area, the better charge separation and preferable catalytic role of central metal cation. Accordingly, this work develops not only a skillful strategy for WO3-based photocatalytic nanomaterials with wide-visible-light response, but also a new route for a cascade Z-scheme photocatalytic system to produce efficiently solar fuels. 110 o C and the sample prepared at 130 o C. The characteristic diffraction peaks of the sample prepared at 110 o C is well consistent with monoclinic phase of WO3 (JCPDS 32-1395).The result J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f shows that the monoclinic phase of WO3 is prepared in the condition of 110 o C hydrothermal temperature. Fig. S1C shows that the amount of OH produced by the sample prepared at 110 o C is much higher than that of the sample prepared at 90 o C and 130 o C. Especially for the sample prepared at 90 o C, which displays the strongest FS intensity, which corresponds to the highest charge separation.As shown in Fig. S1D, the photocatalytic activity of the 110 o C sample is higher than that of the sample prepared at 90 o C and 130 o C, respectively.The results are consistent with the results of BET surface area and the hydroxyl radical amount.As expected, the larger BET surface area and more hydroxyl radicals are beneficial for the improved photocatalytic activities of CO2 reduction.In general, the hydrothermal time has some effect on the structure and performance of the sample.Therefore, the effect of hydrothermal time on P-WO3 is considered in this paper, and the results are shown in Fig. S2.The XRD patterns of samples prepared at different hydrothermal time are illustrated in Fig. S2A.All the samples have the typical peaks assigned to monoclinic phase of WO3 (JCPDS 32-1395), and the crystallinity of samples becomes high with rising the hydrothermal time.According to Table Fig. S3A shows the XRD patterns of samples prepared at different calcination n a l P r e -p r o o f results of SS-SPS responses, the hydroxyl radical (OH) test is carried and the results are shown in Fig. 4B.P-WO3 shows the lowest signal for OH, and with increasing the quantity of used FePc, the signal for OH gradually becomes strong.As for the 0.8FePc/P-WO3 sample, it displays the strongest signal for OH.However, the signal for OH begins to decrease if the amount of FePc continues to increase, indicating that it is much beneficial for producing OH over P-WO3 to modify an appropriate amount of FePc.The result of OH test is consistent with that of SS-SPS. photogenerated electrons in the CB of P-WO3 would quickly combine with the Fig. 1.Nitrogen sorption isotherms (A), the corresponding pore size distribution curves (B), FS spectra related to the amount of produced OH (C) and photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance (D) of WO3 and P-WO3.J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Fig. 2.

Herein, novel Z-scheme iron phthalocyanine (FePc)/porous WO3 nanocomposites as efficient photocatalysts for CO2 reduction have been controllably synthesized by assembling FePc uniformly onto porous WO3 through hydroxyl induction via H-bonding connections.The optimized FePc/WO3 nanocomposite exhibits exceptional photocatalytic activities for reducing CO2 to CO and CH4, attributed to the increased specific surface, enhanced charge separation and extended visible-light utilization.Interestingly, it is confirmed that the enhanced charge separation mainly depends on the novel Z-scheme transfer process with the un-overlapped optical absorption, along with the provided catalytic function of central Fe 2 in FePc for CO2 reduction.Moreover, it is also feasible to replace FePc with other MPcs, and the well-developed strategy with MPc is superior to that with traditional g-C3N4.This work provides a feasible route for the development of efficient WO3-based photocatalysts for CO2 reduction.

In a typical synthetic experiment.Firstly, 0.222 g of polyethylene oxidepolypropylene oxide-polyethylen (P123) (Pluronic, M 5800) was dissolved in 14.444 g of ethanol absolute, and this mixture was stirred continuously for 1 h.Secondly, deionized water was added to the mixture and stirred for another 1 h.Thirdly, 1.5 ml of ethylene glycol was added to the above mixture and stirred for another 2 h to form a clear solution.Finally, the solution was sealed and kept in a brown reagent bottle at least 48 h before using.The solution was named solution P. 0.444 g of WCl6 was added to 16.833 g solution P, and stirred for 20 min to obtain a yellow solution.The solution was then transferred to a 50 ml of Teflon-lined stainless autoclave to be kept under 110 o C for 3 h, and naturally cooled to room temperature.After the solvothermal treatment, the blue precipitate was washed with absolute ethanol, then dried in a vacuum oven at 80 C for 12 h.After that, the precipitate was ground to obtain powder.The powder was placed in a muffle furnace and calcined at 400 o C for 1 h to obtain a yellow sample, which was denoted as P-WO3.For comparison, we prepared H-WO3 by using the previously reported two-phase method 46. A series of FePc/P-WO3 samples were synthesized using a simple impregnation J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f method.Typically, 0.400 g P-WO3 was added to 10 ml absolute ethanol and stirred for 15 min, then the mixture was dispersed in ultrasound for 30 min.Certain amount of 0.040 g/L FePc solution was added to the above mixture in sequence, stirred for 15 min and ultrasonically dispersed for 30 min, respectively.After continuously stirring until dry at 80 o C, the catalysts were dried in a vacuum oven at 80 o C for 12 h.The catalysts were signed as XFePc/WO3 (X 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0), where X denoted as the mass fraction of FePc (FePc/(FePc P-WO3)).In addition, the samples named 0.8MPc/WO3 (M Co, Cu, Zn) were also synthesized followed the above method. The X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples were characterized with a Bruker D8 advance diffractometer, using Cu K radiation.The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of the samples was characterized with a Model Shimadzu UV2700 spectrophotometer, using BaSO4 as a reference.The Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of the samples were characterized with a Bruker Equinox 55 spectrometer, using KBr as diluents.Raman spectra were characterized with a Renishaw invia Confocal Raman spectrometer, a 785 nm laser as excitation source.The specific surface areas were obtained by N2 physisorption at -196 o C on a Micrometrics Tristar II 3020 analyzer using the Brunauer-Emment-Teller (BET) method.The samples were degassed under vacuum at 150 o C for 6 h and cooled in vacuum to room temperature before each analysis.The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was recorded on a Kratos-AXIS ULTRA DLD system, using a monochromatic Al K X-rays, the binding energy (BE) was calibrated internally by the adventitious C 1s peak at 284.4 eV.Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the samples were taken by a JEOLJEM-2010 electron microscope with an acceleration voltage of 200 kV.The steady-state surface photovoltage spectroscopy (SS-SPS) measurement of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f the samples was used with a home-built apparatus, the signals were collected with a lock-in amplier (SR830) synchronized with a light chopper (SR540), the monochromatic light was obtained with passing light from a 500W xenon lamp (CHF XQ500W) across a double prism monochromator (SBP300). Hydroxyl radicals (OH) are known to be important active species in photocatalytic reaction.In order to improve the sensitivity, coumarin as a labeled molecule was used to detect the content of hydroxyl radicals, the method is very effective.The hydroxyl radical test was as follows: 0.020 g of the catalyst was placed in 20 mL of coumarin solution at a concentration of 110 -3 M. The mixture was stirred for 10 min in the dark before the testing, to ensure that it reached the adsorptiondesorption equilibrium.After irradiation for 30 min, appropriate amount of the suspension was centrifuged in a 10 mL centrifuge tube and the supernatant was transferred into a Pyrex glass cell for the fluorescence measurement of 7hydroxycoumarin at 332 nm excitation wavelength with an emission wavelength at 460 nm through a spectrofluorometer (Perkin-Elmer LS55) 47 . A typical three-electrode system was used to measure photoelectrochemical (PEC) behavior.The prepared catalyst was used as working electrode, a platinum plate (99.9) was served as the counter electrode, a saturated KCl Ag/AgCl electrode was selected to use as the reference electrode, and 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution as the electrolyte.High purity nitrogen gas (99.999) was bubbled through the electrolyte before and during the experiment.The test was taken in a quartz cell using a 500 W xenon lamp with a cut-off filter ( 420 nm) as the illumination source.The samples were tested the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f photoelectrochemical performance by an IVIUM V13806 electrochemical workstation. The temperature of each experiment was kept at room temperature (about 25 C). Electrochemical (EC) measurements were carried out in the N2-bubbled and CO2 systems on the same conditions stated above. The CO2-temperature programmed desorption (CO2-TPD) measurements were carried out with 50 mg samples of the catalysts.Before the CO2-TPD measurement, the catalysts were purged at 300 C for 30 min under He (30 mLmin -1 ) flow and cooled to 30 C.The samples were then treated with pure CO2 (50 mLmin -1 ) for 30 min at 30 C. The physical adsorbed CO2 was purged with He (30 mLmin -1 ) for 1 h before running the TPD experiments.The sample was heated from 30 C to 550 C at a rate of 10 o C/min in a high purity He (30 mLmin -1 ).During the TPD experiments, the signal of m/e 28 was continuously monitored using quadrupole mass spectra (QIC-20, HIDEN). In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectra (In-situ DRIFTS) were collected from 650 cm -1 to 4000 cm -1 at a spectral resolution of 4 cm -1 with 16 scans on a FTIR spectrometer (Nicolet is50) equipped with a high-sensitive MCT detector cooled by liquid N2 and DRIFT cell (Harrick).Each sample was first put in a drying oven at 110 o C for 2 h, and then was purged with high purified N2 (30 mLmin - 1 ) at room temperature for 1 h in the in-situ tank, in order to eliminate the physical adsorbed water and other impurities, then the background spectra was recorded.The experiment of in-situ DRIFTS of CO2 H2O included the following steps.First step, 30 ml/min pure CO2 was introduced into H2O (L), then the mixture was through the sample surface for 30 min, the spectra of different time were recorded with subtracting from the background spectrum in dark conditions.The second step, the CO2 and H2O J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f (L) were turned off, then 30 ml/min pure N2 was introduced, the spectra of different time were recorded with subtracting from the background spectrum in simulated sunlight. In the photocatalytic reduction of CO2, 0.100 g of catalyst was scattered in 5 ml water contained in a cylindrical steel reactor with 100 mL volume and 3.5 cm 2 area. High purity CO2 gas was passed through water and then entered into the reaction device with stirred for 20 min.After that, the gas was turned off and continually stirred for another 10 min.The photocatalyst was allowed to equilibrate in the CO2/H2O system. A 300 W Xenon arc lamp was used as the light source followed by irradiation for 4 hours.Finish irradiation, extract 0.25 ml from the reaction cell at given time interval for CO and CH4 concentration analysis by a gas chromatograph (GC-7920, Beijing), and the O2 concentration was detected with a gas chromatograph (GC-7900, Beijing)."}], "operation mode": []}}
