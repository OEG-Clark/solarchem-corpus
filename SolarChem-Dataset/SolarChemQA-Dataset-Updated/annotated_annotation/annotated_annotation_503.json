Different types of ZnS and CuS photocatalysts (samples 1-4) were prepared via solution method that is described in (Ebrahimi et al., 2016).Sample numbers 5, 6, and 7 were synthesized by co-precipitation of 5, 10, and 15, respectively, of copper acetate with zinc acetate in the precipitation step to investigate its effects on catalytic reduction of CO 2 .According to the optimum properties found in (Ebrahimi et al., 2016), the proportion of CTAB stabilizer to CEC of clay was chosen to be 2.5 (shown in Table 1) to expand the basal spacing of MMT.This will result in higher specific surface area and better adsorption of CO 2 in the bilayer area. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs were obtained by a FEI ESEM Quanta 650 instrument operated at 20 kV, and the elemental analysis was also completed by EDAX detector.Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations were made to observe the size distribution of catalyst nanoparticles on the surface of MMT using a PHILIPS CM 30 operated at 300 kV.Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra were obtained by a KBr tablet method using a Bruker Tensor 27 routine Fourier transform spectrometer to examine whether CTAB reacted with MMT or not.The X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) patterns were taken by a D8 Advance machine made by Bruker to calculate the d-spacing and to identify the accompanying crystals.Diffractions were taken at 40 kV and 40 mA (CuK radiation, wavelength 1.54 A) one degree per minute advancement in 2 scale.Thermogravimetric (TG) was carried out to measure the weight percent of CTAB intercalated in the bilayer area of MMT by a STA 409 NETZSCH machine.The sample was heated at a rate of 10C per minute in a platinum crucible and neutral environment.The nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms were examined at 77 K by a Belsorp mini II, and the specific surface area was determined employing the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method.The pore size distribution was also obtained from the adsorption branch of the isotherm by means of Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method.The degassing was done for 15 h at 120C. Photocatalytic test for CO 2 reduction was performed in a glass vessel connected to a stainless steel case that contains the 8W Hg UV lamp (at 254 nm).A pump circulates the mixture of catalyst, water, and dissolved carbon dioxide from glass vessel to lamp case.More detailed condition of the reactor could be found in author's earlier research (Ebrahimi et al., 2016). Elemental analysis and other chemical information of catalysts are shown in Table 1.As evident, acid activation increases the surface area and absorption capacity of MMT for CTAB, zinc, and copper.This fact results in higher active surface area available for catalytic reduction of CO 2 and for adsorption of catalyst nanoparticles in the synthesis step of catalyst preparation in both samples.Basal spacing of all samples seems to be uniform, which reveals that the bilayer space depends only on the ratio of CTAB to CEC of clay.Surface area, pore diameter, and pore volume results show that these properties only depend on CTAB to CEC ratio and acid activation; therefore, it could be accordingly deduced that the ZnS or CuS deposition does not affect it.FTIR spectra of sample numbers 2 and 4 are shown in Figure 1.The stretching vibrations of C-H bonds at 2924 and 2851 cm -1 were observed in both samples that confirm the presence of CTA.Substitution of Mg 2 for Al 3 is seen in the peak at 792 cm -1 .The 1035 and 3618 cm -1 peaks are due to Si-O and Al-O bonds of MMT, respectively. The TEM micrograph of sample numbers 3 and 4 is shown in Figure 2. The CuS-CTA agglomerates composed of small CuS nanoparticles of diameter 3-10 nanometers on external surface of MMT are visible in both samples.As a result of higher available surface area and smaller particle size in sample number 4, the agglomerate size and distribution are much more uniform than sample number 3.This fact will result in higher catalyst activity and more yield in reaction chamber. SEM micrograph of sample number 4 is shown in Figure 3, which indicates the mesoporous morphology and fine particle size of MMT from 2 to 8 m particles in this acid activated sample.The EDAX analysis revealed that ZnS nanoparticles distributed all over the AAMMT correspondingly.This matter will lead to a better charge separation and finally higher yield of products. The photocatalytic test results of all samples are shown in Table 1.H 2 , CH 4 , and CO were recognized in the GC diagrams.A small amount of other light hydrocarbons was also produced.The proposed reduction reactions of carbon dioxide to CH 4 and CO 2 are as follows.First of all, electrons are transferred from conduction band of ZnS or CuS to valence band, to reduce carbon dioxide.Meanwhile, the holes are reacted with water to produce oxygen and hydrogen: It is worth noting that hydrogen atoms liberated from water decomposition reaction (Eq.( 2)) react with each other to produce hydrogen molecules (Eq.( 4)).The next suggested step is the reduction of carbon dioxide by hydrogen on the catalyst surface to produce radicals, which leads to methane formation: Although carbon monoxide needs only two electrons in comparison with methane that needs eight electrons to be produced, obviously the carbon monoxide could be more reduced to methane by hydrogen; accordingly, methane production would be regarded as a more favorable product in reaction vessel, as confirmed by other researchers and experiments (Koci et al., 2014).Gas sampling rate of all samples was one per 6 hours, but since the evolution of products were linear during the whole test, the final and most distinguishable results were reported after 24 hours.It is clear that sample numbers 3 and 4 have lower catalytic activity than the other samples.This shows that CuS has a lower catalytic activity because of its lower band gap energy in comparison with ZnS (Kozak et al., 2010;Sreelekha et al., 2016).It is shown when ZnS nanoparticles are doped with 10 of CuS particles in sample 6, the best results are obtained.This could be interpreted as a result of better interfacial charge transfer in this sample (Wang et al., 2016).No deactivation of the catalyst was observed after five repeated tests. Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction over ZnS, CuS, and CuS doped ZnS-MMT and AAMMT-CTAB nanocomposites were investigated in this paper.Effects of different synthesis procedures on the nanocatalyst structure were investigated.Main gaseous products were detected by GC to be H 2 , CH 4 , and CO, respectively, as confirmed by proposed reaction sets.Highest yields of CH 4 and H 2 were 136 and 1083 mole gcatal -1 , which were obtained from sample number 6.This was due to better dispersion of nanocatalyst on MMT surface, small particle size of nanocatalyst, optimum ratio of CTAB/CEC, optimum percentage of CuS in doped samples, better charge transfer, and prevention of electron-hole recombination.

The CuS-CTA agglomerates composed of small CuS nanoparticles of diameter 3-10 nanometers on external surface of MMT are visible in both samples.As a result of higher available surface area and smaller particle size in sample number 4, the agglomerate size and distribution are much more uniform than sample number 3.This fact will result in higher catalyst activity and more yield in reaction chamber. SEM micrograph of sample number 4 is shown in Figure 3, which indicates the mesoporous morphology and fine particle size of MMT from 2 to 8 m particles in this acid activated sample.The EDAX analysis revealed that ZnS nanoparticles distributed all over the AAMMT correspondingly.This matter will lead to a better charge separation and finally higher yield of products. The photocatalytic test results of all samples are shown in Table 1.H 2 , CH 4 , and CO were recognized in the GC diagrams.A small amount of other light hydrocarbons was also produced.The proposed reduction reactions of carbon dioxide to CH 4 and CO 2 are as follows.First of all, electrons are transferred from conduction band of ZnS or CuS to valence band, to reduce carbon dioxide.Meanwhile, the holes are reacted with water to produce oxygen and hydrogen: It is worth noting that hydrogen atoms liberated from water decomposition reaction (Eq.( 2)) react with each other to produce hydrogen molecules (Eq.( 4)).The next suggested step is the reduction of carbon dioxide by hydrogen on the catalyst surface to produce radicals, which leads to methane formation: Although carbon monoxide needs only two electrons in comparison with methane that needs eight electrons to be produced, obviously the carbon monoxide could be more reduced to methane by hydrogen; accordingly, methane production would be regarded as a more favorable product in reaction vessel, as confirmed by other researchers and experiments (Koci et al., 2014).Gas sampling rate of all samples was one per 6 hours, but since the evolution of products were linear during the whole test, the final and most distinguishable results were reported after 24 hours.It is clear that sample numbers 3 and 4 have lower catalytic activity than the other samples.This shows that CuS has a lower catalytic activity because of its lower band gap energy in comparison with ZnS (Kozak et al., 2010;Sreelekha et al., 2016).It is shown when ZnS nanoparticles are doped with 10 of CuS particles in sample 6, the best results are obtained.This could be interpreted as a result of better interfacial charge transfer in this sample (Wang et al., 2016).No deactivation of the catalyst was observed after five repeated tests. Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction over ZnS, CuS, and CuS doped ZnS-MMT and AAMMT-CTAB nanocomposites were investigated in this paper.Effects of different synthesis procedures on the nanocatalyst structure were investigated.Main gaseous products were detected by GC to be H 2 , CH 4 , and CO, respectively, as confirmed by proposed reaction sets.Highest yields of CH 4 and H 2 were 136 and 1083 mole gcatal -1 , which were obtained from sample number 6.This was due to better dispersion of nanocatalyst on MMT surface, small particle size of nanocatalyst, optimum ratio of CTAB/CEC, optimum percentage of CuS in doped samples, better charge transfer, and prevention of electron-hole recombination.
