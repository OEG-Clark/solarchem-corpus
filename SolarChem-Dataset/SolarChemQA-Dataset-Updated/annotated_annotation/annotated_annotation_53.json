Ltd.) to NH 4 OH solution.The precipitated gel was filtered under vacuum and washed with distilled water.The gel was then dried at 353 K for 24 h, followed by calcination at 1073 K for 6 h.The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern indicated that the prepared Ga 2 O 3 was phase and that the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface area was 17 m 2 g -1 . Reactions.Reactants were purified prior to use in the following manner.H 2 was purified by passing it through a liquid N 2 and molecular sieve trap.CO 2 was purified by vacuum distillation at the temperature of liquid N 2 .The photoreaction was carried out in a closed circulating system connected to a vacuum line.A portion of 1.0 g of Ga 2 O 3 was spread on the flat bottom (50 ) of a quartz reactor (dead space: 150 mL).Prior to photoreaction, the sample was evacuated at 673 K and pretreated with 8 kPa O 2 for 60 min at 673 K, followed by evacuation for 15 min at the same temperature.CO 2 (150 mol) and H 2 (150 mol) were admitted to the reactor after the pretreatment.The Ga 2 O 3 sample was illuminated from the bottom of the reactor with a 200 W Hg-Xe lamp (San-Ei Electric Co., Ltd., UVF-204S type B).Analysis of the products was performed by thermal conductivity detector gas chromatography (TCD-GC), using a gas chromatograph (Shimadzu Corporation, Shimadzu GC-8A) equipped with a column packed with active carbon, with He as the carrier gas. Adsorption Isotherms.Ga 2 O 3 was evacuated at 673 K and pretreated with 8 kPa O 2 for 60 min at 673 K, followed by evacuation for 15 min at the same temperature.After the pretreatment, a typical adsorption isotherm of CO 2 was measured at room temperature (chemisorption physisorption).CO 2 was evacuated for 30 min at room temperature to remove CO 2 in the gas phase, leaving CO 2 physisorbed on Ga 2 O 3 .The CO 2 adsorption isotherm was then measured again (physisorption).A chemisorption isotherm was obtained by the subtraction of the second adsorption isotherm from the first adsorption isotherm. FT-IR Spectroscopy.FT-IR spectra of a sample and adsorbed species were recorded with a Perkin-Elmer Spectrum One FT-IR spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer) in a transmission mode at room temperature.A Ga 2 O 3 sample (ca.80 mg) was pressed into a wafer (diameter ) 13 mm) at a pressure of 9.8 MPa and placed in a conventional in situ IR cell equipped with CaF 2 windows.The cell allowed us to perform heating, O 2 treatment, introduction of substrates, photoirradiation, and measurement of spectra in situ.Before measurement, the sample was evacuated at 673 K, followed by treatment with 8 kPa of O 2 for 60 min and evacuation for 15 min at 673 K.For each spectrum, the data from 16 scans were accumulated at a resolution of 4 cm -1 ."}, {"llm generation": "MgO, CaO", "source": "Photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 to CO in the presence of H 2 took place over solid bases such as MgO and CaO.", "context": "Table 1 shows the amounts of CO gas evolved over various metal oxides after photoirradiation for 5 h.Photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 to CO in the presence of H 2 took place over solid bases such as MgO and CaO.Furthermore, Al 2 O 3 , ZrO 2 , and Ga 2 O 3 , which have a basic site, also showed photocatalytic activity.However, solid acidic and inert materials did not activate CO 2 because it was not absorbed on the surface.Among the solid bases, the highest amount of CO was produced with Ga 2 O 3 and with MgO. Figure 1 shows the time dependence of the amount of CO gas evolved over Ga 2 O 3 under photoirradiation.The rate of CO evolution gradually decreased with increasing photoirradiation time.After photoirradiation for 48 h, 10.96 mol of CO gas evolved over Ga 2 O 3 , and 7.3 of CO 2 was converted.Figure 2 illustrates the time dependence of the amount of CO gas evolved over Ga 2 O 3 after a series of reactions.The second and third reactions were carried out after evacuation at room temperature and 673 K, respectively.The initial rates of CO gas evolution in the second and third reactions were almost restored to that of the first reaction.The fourth reaction was carried out after evacuation and O 2 treatment at 673 K.The initial rate of CO gas evolution was completely restored to that of the first run.These results indicate that the decrease in the rate of CO evolution resulted from the generation of H 2 O and inactive carbon species, which blocks the adsorption sites of H 2 and CO 2 . In previous studies using ZrO 2 and MgO, we concluded that the basic sites, which chemically adsorb CO 2 , contribute to the development of photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 . 7891012 Ga 2 O 3 can chemisorb CO 2 on its surface.Figure 3 shows the chemisorption isotherm of CO 2 on Ga 2 O 3 and the relationship between the initial pressure of introduced CO 2 gas and the amount of .The amount of chemisorbed CO 2 was smaller than that of MgO and ZrO 2 .Further, the amount of CO gas evolved under photoirradiation increased with increasing initial pressure of introduced CO 2 gas and depended on the amount of chemisorbed CO 2 .This indicates that the chemisorbed CO 2 was reduced to CO under photoirradiation.It has been reported that H 2 and CO 2 are both chemisorbed on the Ga 2 O 3 surface, although H 2 is not adsorbed on MgO and ZrO 2 .The adsorption isotherm of H 2 on Ga 2 O 3 after pretreatment is shown in Figure 4.It was possible to fit the isotherm to a Langmuir isotherm with dissociation. 22herefore, H 2 undergoes dissociation on the surface.The saturation amount of adsorbed H 2 was calculated to be 7.1 mol per grams of Ga 2 O 3 -1 .H 2 and CO 2 can both be adsorbed on Ga 2 O 3 ; however, it is not apparent whether or not the adsorption site for H 2 is same as that for CO 2 .Figure 5 ).This implies that Ga 2 O 3 possesses not only adsorption sites for CO 2 or H 2 but also sites where both CO 2 and H 2 can be adsorbed.Furthermore, the amount of CO gas evolved increased with increasing initial pressure of introduced H 2 , as shown in Figure 5.The amount of CO gas evolved depended on the amount of H 2 adsorbed on Ga 2 O 3 after CO 2 chemisorption, although the amount of H 2 gas introduced did not affect the photocatalytic activity in the case of ZrO 2 and MgO.Therefore, CO 2 is reduced to CO by dissociatively adsorbed H 2 on the Ga 2 O 3 surface.This implies that the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 proceeds on the basis of a typical Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism.Therefore, we concluded that the reaction mechanism over Ga 2 O 3 is different from that over MgO and ZrO 2 and that dissociatively adsorbed H 2 on Ga 2 O 3 plays an important role in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 . A peak assigned to an OH stretching band (OH) of an isolated surface hydroxyl group was observed at 3748 cm -1 in the IR spectrum of Ga 2 O 3 after pretreatment, as shown in Figure 6.As mentioned above, CO 2 can be adsorbed on the Ga 2 O 3 surface.Figure 7 kPa of CO 2 .The IR spectrum of pretreated Ga 2 O 3 (Figure 6) was used as the background for all of the difference IR spectra.When CO 2 was introduced on Ga 2 O 3 , four bands appeared at 1634, 1463, 1431, and 1228 cm -1 .We identified these bands as being derived from bicarbonate species on Ga 2 O 3 , as shown in Chart 1. 21,23 The bands at 1634 and 1228 cm -1 are assigned to an asymmetric CO 3 stretching vibration band as (CO 3 ) and an OH deformation vibration band (OH), respectively.The bands at 1463 and 1431 cm -1 are assigned to symmetric CO 3 stretching vibration bands s (CO 3 ) of bidentate bicarbonate species (species A in Chart 1a) and monodentate bicarbonate species (species B in Chart 1b), respectively.The absorbance of the band at 1431 cm -1 increased with the amount of CO 2 introduced and became saturated after the introduction of CO 2 exceeded 2.5 kPa.In contrast, the absorbance of the band at 1463 cm -1 , which was derived from bidentate bicarbonate species, decreased with the amount of CO 2 introduced and vanished after the introduction of CO 2 exceeded 2.5 kPa.The amount of chemisorbed CO 2 gas was consistent with that of evolved CO gas, and these reached saturation at a CO 2 equilibrium pressure of around 2.5 kPa, as shown in Figure 3.This indicates that the amount of CO gas evolved over Ga 2 O 3 depends on the amount of monodentate bicarbonate species on Ga 2 O 3 and that the bidentate bicarbonate species is converted to the monodentate bicarbonate species when the amount of CO 2 introduced is increased.Therefore, the chemisorbed CO 2 species involved in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 over Ga 2 O 3 is the monodentate bicarbonate species, not the bidentate bicarbonate species. Figure 8 represents the difference IR spectrum of the adsorbed species on Ga 2 O 3 after the introduction of 10.0 kPa of H 2 .After the introduction of H 2 , the (OH) band at 3686 cm -1 increased in intensity, and new bands appeared at 1973 and 1949 cm -1 .We identified the bands at 1973 and 1949 cm -1 as arising from Ga-H species. 20,242552627 Collins et al. 20 reported that two bands resulting from the Ga-H species are observed at 2003 and 1980 cm -1 after the adsorption of H 2 on Ga 2 O 3 at 723 K and that the bands at 2003 and 1980 cm -1 can be assigned to the stretching frequencies of H bonded to coordinatively unsaturated Ga cations in tetrahedral and octahedral positions, respectively. 20he inset picture in Figure 8 shows the difference IR spectrum of the adsorbed species on Ga 2 O 3 after the introduction of 10.0 kPa of D 2 .The band assigned to (OD) of the isolated Ga-OD group was observed at 2723 cm -1 .The experimental ratio of the (OH)/(OD) frequencies is 1.35.This ratio agrees with the theoretical ratio of 1.37 expected for H-D isotopic exchange in Ga-OH species (OH)/(OD) ) ( OD / OH ) 1/2 , where OD and OH are the reduced masses of OD and OH, respectively.The bands assigned to Ga-D stretching vibrations (Ga-D) were observed at 1429 and 1404 cm -1 .The experimental ratios of (Ga-H)/(Ga-D) are 1.38 and 1.39, respectively, in good agreement with the theoretical ratio of 1.40.Therefore, it was concluded that Ga-OH species and Ga-H species are formed on the surface of Ga 2 O 3 via heterolytic adsorption of molecular H 2 . Figure 9 shows the difference IR spectra of the adsorbed species on Ga 2 O 3 (a) after the introduction of 6.0 kPa of CO 2 , (b) after the introduction of 5.8 kPa of H 2 , and (c) under photoirradiation for 12 h.As mentioned above, the bands assigned to monodentate bicarbonate species appeared at 1634, 1432, and 1229 cm -1 .The bands remained unchanged, and new bands were not observed after the introduction of H 2 .On the other hand, after photoirradiation in the presence of CO 2 and H 2 , the monodentate bicarbonate species bands disappeared, and six new bands appeared at 2962, 2927, 2857, 1578, 1389, and 1359 cm -1 .The broad band at 3800-3300 cm -1 derived from an OH stretching vibration also increased after photoirradiation.This indicated the generation of H 2 O by the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 by H 2 (CO 2 H 2 f CO H 2 O). Figure 10 shows the difference IR spectra of the adsorbed species on Ga 2 O 3 (a) after the introduction of 10.0 kPa of H 2 , (b) after the introduction of 6.0 kPa of CO 2 , (c) under photoirradiation for 1 h, and (d) under photoirradiation for 12 h.When CO 2 was introduced, the bands at 1973 and 1949 cm -1 derived from Ga-H species were shifted to higher wavenumbers, and the peak of the band appeared at 1988 cm -1 .Under photoirradiation, the band at 1988 cm -1 decreased gradually and disappeared after photoirradiation for 12 h.No band was observed in the 1800-1150 cm -1 region when H 2 was introduced.When CO 2 was introduced, the bands at 1630, 1433, and 1230 cm -1 derived from the monodentate bicarbonate species and the band at 1459 cm -1 derived from the bidentate bicarbonates species were observed.Moreover, another band appeared at 1580 cm -1 .Under photoirradiation, the band at 1580 cm -1 increased in intensity, and new bands appeared at 1389 and 1361 cm -1 .In contrast, the bands derived from the monodentate and bidentate bicarbonate species decreased in intensity under photoirradiation.As the bands at 1580, 1389, and 1361 cm -1 are similar to the bands which appeared under photoirradiation shown in Figure 9, the surface intermediate may be generated from the monodentate bicarbonate species under photoirradiation.The change in the spectra in the region of 2150-1800 cm -1 indicates that the H atom of the Ga-H species reduces the monodentate bicarbonate to the surface intermediate under photoirradiation.Figure 11 illustrates the difference IR spectra of the adsorbed species on Ga 2 O 3 (a) after photoirradiation for 12 h in the presence of CO 2 and H 2 and (b) after the introduction of formaldehyde at 1.0 kPa.Bands appeared at 2982, 2922, 2792, 1575, 1384, and 1356 cm -1 after both the introduction of formaldehyde and photoirradiation.It is known that formate species are formed on a metal oxide by the adsorption of formaldehyde. 2829930313233 The bands at 2922, 1575, 1384, and 1356 cm -1 are assigned to (CH), as (CO 2 ), (CH), and s (CO 2 ) of bidentate formate species (species C in Chart 1c) on Ga 2 O 3 , respectively. 21,23usca et al. 30 confirmed that the bands of formate species on various metal oxide surfaces were complex in the 3000-2700 cm -1 region because of the fundamental (CH) band and the combinations or overtones of as (CO 2 ) and (CH).It is thought that the band at 2982 cm -1 is generated from the combination of as (CO 2 ) and (CH) and the band at 2792 cm -1 is generated from the combination of s (CO 2 ) and (CH).We concluded that the surface species for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 in the presence of H 2 is a bidentate formate species.This species decomposes into CO gas. The series of FT-IR spectra showed that the bidentate formate intermediate was decomposed to CO. Figure 12 shows the time dependence of the amount of CO gas evolved from the bidentate formate species on Ga 2 O 3 in dark or under photoirradiation.The bidentate formate species was formed by the adsorption of formaldehyde on pretreated Ga 2 O 3 at an equilibrium pressure of 1.0 kPa, followed by evacuation to remove formaldehyde in the gas phase and physisorbed on Ga 2 O 3 , as mentioned above.A negligible amount of CO gas was evolved from the surface bidentate formate on Ga 2 O 3 at 303 and 323 K in the dark; however, the amount of CO gas evolved increased dramatically on photoirradiation.It was clear that the decomposition of the bidentate formate to CO gas resulted from photoirradiation rather than from heat treatment. We propose a Langmuir-Hinshelwood-type mechanism for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 over Ga 2 O 3 in the presence of H 2 , as shown in Scheme 1.The FT-IR spectrum showed that the surface hydroxyl group remains on Ga 2 O 3 after pretreatment.A monodentate bicarbonate species is formed in the presence of CO 2 on Ga 2 O 3 .H 2 is dissociatively adsorbed on Ga 2 O 3 , and Ga-H and Ga-OH species are formed via heterolytic adsorption.Under photoirradiation, the monodentate bicarbonate species is reduced by the dissociatively adsorbed hydrogen to a bidentate formate species.The bidentate formate species on Ga 2 O 3 decomposes into CO under photoirradiation.We found that the mechanism over Ga 2 O 3 is different from the mechanisms over ZrO 2 or MgO."}, {"llm generation": "Ga 2 O 3", "source": "Ga 2 O 3 showed higher activity for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 than other solid bases such as MgO in spite of the small amount of CO 2 adsorbed on the surface (conversion: 7.3 for 48 h of photoirradiation).", "context": "Ga 2 O 3 showed higher activity for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 than other solid bases such as MgO in spite of the small amount of CO 2 adsorbed on the surface (conversion: 7.3 for 48 h of photoirradiation).We clarified a Langmuir-Hinshelwood type mechanism for the photocatalytic reaction of CO 2 wherein the monodentate bicarbonate species was reduced by the dissociatively adsorbed H 2 and then the generated bidentate formate on Ga 2 O 3 decom-posed into CO under photoirradiation.The dissociatively adsorbed H 2 on Ga 2 O 3 improved the photocatalytic activity for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .

Reactions.Reactants were purified prior to use in the following manner.H 2 was purified by passing it through a liquid N 2 and molecular sieve trap.CO 2 was purified by vacuum distillation at the temperature of liquid N 2 .The photoreaction was carried out in a closed circulating system connected to a vacuum line.A portion of 1.0 g of Ga 2 O 3 was spread on the flat bottom (50 ) of a quartz reactor (dead space: 150 mL).Prior to photoreaction, the sample was evacuated at 673 K and pretreated with 8 kPa O 2 for 60 min at 673 K, followed by evacuation for 15 min at the same temperature.CO 2 (150 mol) and H 2 (150 mol) were admitted to the reactor after the pretreatment.The Ga 2 O 3 sample was illuminated from the bottom of the reactor with a 200 W Hg-Xe lamp (San-Ei Electric Co., Ltd., UVF-204S type B).Analysis of the products was performed by thermal conductivity detector gas chromatography (TCD-GC), using a gas chromatograph (Shimadzu Corporation, Shimadzu GC-8A) equipped with a column packed with active carbon, with He as the carrier gas. Adsorption Isotherms.Ga 2 O 3 was evacuated at 673 K and pretreated with 8 kPa O 2 for 60 min at 673 K, followed by evacuation for 15 min at the same temperature.After the pretreatment, a typical adsorption isotherm of CO 2 was measured at room temperature (chemisorption physisorption).CO 2 was evacuated for 30 min at room temperature to remove CO 2 in the gas phase, leaving CO 2 physisorbed on Ga 2 O 3 .The CO 2 adsorption isotherm was then measured again (physisorption).A chemisorption isotherm was obtained by the subtraction of the second adsorption isotherm from the first adsorption isotherm.

Figure 1 shows the time dependence of the amount of CO gas evolved over Ga 2 O 3 under photoirradiation.The rate of CO evolution gradually decreased with increasing photoirradiation time.After photoirradiation for 48 h, 10.96 mol of CO gas evolved over Ga 2 O 3 , and 7.3 of CO 2 was converted.Figure 2 illustrates the time dependence of the amount of CO gas evolved over Ga 2 O 3 after a series of reactions.The second and third reactions were carried out after evacuation at room temperature and 673 K, respectively.The initial rates of CO gas evolution in the second and third reactions were almost restored to that of the first reaction.The fourth reaction was carried out after evacuation and O 2 treatment at 673 K.The initial rate of CO gas evolution was completely restored to that of the first run.These results indicate that the decrease in the rate of CO evolution resulted from the generation of H 2 O and inactive carbon species, which blocks the adsorption sites of H 2 and CO 2 . In previous studies using ZrO 2 and MgO, we concluded that the basic sites, which chemically adsorb CO 2 , contribute to the development of photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 . 7891012 Ga 2 O 3 can chemisorb CO 2 on its surface.Figure 3 shows the chemisorption isotherm of CO 2 on Ga 2 O 3 and the relationship between the initial pressure of introduced CO 2 gas and the amount of .The amount of chemisorbed CO 2 was smaller than that of MgO and ZrO 2 .Further, the amount of CO gas evolved under photoirradiation increased with increasing initial pressure of introduced CO 2 gas and depended on the amount of chemisorbed CO 2 .This indicates that the chemisorbed CO 2 was reduced to CO under photoirradiation.It has been reported that H 2 and CO 2 are both chemisorbed on the Ga 2 O 3 surface, although H 2 is not adsorbed on MgO and ZrO 2 .The adsorption isotherm of H 2 on Ga 2 O 3 after pretreatment is shown in Figure 4.It was possible to fit the isotherm to a Langmuir isotherm with dissociation. 22herefore, H 2 undergoes dissociation on the surface.The saturation amount of adsorbed H 2 was calculated to be 7.1 mol per grams of Ga 2 O 3 -1 .H 2 and CO 2 can both be adsorbed on Ga 2 O 3 ; however, it is not apparent whether or not the adsorption site for H 2 is same as that for CO 2 .Figure 5 ).This implies that Ga 2 O 3 possesses not only adsorption sites for CO 2 or H 2 but also sites where both CO 2 and H 2 can be adsorbed.Furthermore, the amount of CO gas evolved increased with increasing initial pressure of introduced H 2 , as shown in Figure 5.The amount of CO gas evolved depended on the amount of H 2 adsorbed on Ga 2 O 3 after CO 2 chemisorption, although the amount of H 2 gas introduced did not affect the photocatalytic activity in the case of ZrO 2 and MgO.Therefore, CO 2 is reduced to CO by dissociatively adsorbed H 2 on the Ga 2 O 3 surface.This implies that the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 proceeds on the basis of a typical Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism.Therefore, we concluded that the reaction mechanism over Ga 2 O 3 is different from that over MgO and ZrO 2 and that dissociatively adsorbed H 2 on Ga 2 O 3 plays an important role in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 . A peak assigned to an OH stretching band (OH) of an isolated surface hydroxyl group was observed at 3748 cm -1 in the IR spectrum of Ga 2 O 3 after pretreatment, as shown in Figure 6.As mentioned above, CO 2 can be adsorbed on the Ga 2 O 3 surface.Figure 7 kPa of CO 2 .The IR spectrum of pretreated Ga 2 O 3 (Figure 6) was used as the background for all of the difference IR spectra.When CO 2 was introduced on Ga 2 O 3 , four bands appeared at 1634, 1463, 1431, and 1228 cm -1 .We identified these bands as being derived from bicarbonate species on Ga 2 O 3 , as shown in Chart 1. 21,23 The bands at 1634 and 1228 cm -1 are assigned to an asymmetric CO 3 stretching vibration band as (CO 3 ) and an OH deformation vibration band (OH), respectively.The bands at 1463 and 1431 cm -1 are assigned to symmetric CO 3 stretching vibration bands s (CO 3 ) of bidentate bicarbonate species (species A in Chart 1a) and monodentate bicarbonate species (species B in Chart 1b), respectively.The absorbance of the band at 1431 cm -1 increased with the amount of CO 2 introduced and became saturated after the introduction of CO 2 exceeded 2.5 kPa.In contrast, the absorbance of the band at 1463 cm -1 , which was derived from bidentate bicarbonate species, decreased with the amount of CO 2 introduced and vanished after the introduction of CO 2 exceeded 2.5 kPa.The amount of chemisorbed CO 2 gas was consistent with that of evolved CO gas, and these reached saturation at a CO 2 equilibrium pressure of around 2.5 kPa, as shown in Figure 3.This indicates that the amount of CO gas evolved over Ga 2 O 3 depends on the amount of monodentate bicarbonate species on Ga 2 O 3 and that the bidentate bicarbonate species is converted to the monodentate bicarbonate species when the amount of CO 2 introduced is increased.Therefore, the chemisorbed CO 2 species involved in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 over Ga 2 O 3 is the monodentate bicarbonate species, not the bidentate bicarbonate species. Figure 8 represents the difference IR spectrum of the adsorbed species on Ga 2 O 3 after the introduction of 10.0 kPa of H 2 .After the introduction of H 2 , the (OH) band at 3686 cm -1 increased in intensity, and new bands appeared at 1973 and 1949 cm -1 .We identified the bands at 1973 and 1949 cm -1 as arising from Ga-H species. 20,242552627 Collins et al. 20 reported that two bands resulting from the Ga-H species are observed at 2003 and 1980 cm -1 after the adsorption of H 2 on Ga 2 O 3 at 723 K and that the bands at 2003 and 1980 cm -1 can be assigned to the stretching frequencies of H bonded to coordinatively unsaturated Ga cations in tetrahedral and octahedral positions, respectively. 20he inset picture in Figure 8 shows the difference IR spectrum of the adsorbed species on Ga 2 O 3 after the introduction of 10.0 kPa of D 2 .The band assigned to (OD) of the isolated Ga-OD group was observed at 2723 cm -1 .The experimental ratio of the (OH)/(OD) frequencies is 1.35.This ratio agrees with the theoretical ratio of 1.37 expected for H-D isotopic exchange in Ga-OH species (OH)/(OD) ) ( OD / OH ) 1/2 , where OD and OH are the reduced masses of OD and OH, respectively.The bands assigned to Ga-D stretching vibrations (Ga-D) were observed at 1429 and 1404 cm -1 .The experimental ratios of (Ga-H)/(Ga-D) are 1.38 and 1.39, respectively, in good agreement with the theoretical ratio of 1.40.Therefore, it was concluded that Ga-OH species and Ga-H species are formed on the surface of Ga 2 O 3 via heterolytic adsorption of molecular H 2 . Figure 9 shows the difference IR spectra of the adsorbed species on Ga 2 O 3 (a) after the introduction of 6.0 kPa of CO 2 , (b) after the introduction of 5.8 kPa of H 2 , and (c) under photoirradiation for 12 h.As mentioned above, the bands assigned to monodentate bicarbonate species appeared at 1634, 1432, and 1229 cm -1 .The bands remained unchanged, and new bands were not observed after the introduction of H 2 .On the other hand, after photoirradiation in the presence of CO 2 and H 2 , the monodentate bicarbonate species bands disappeared, and six new bands appeared at 2962, 2927, 2857, 1578, 1389, and 1359 cm -1 .The broad band at 3800-3300 cm -1 derived from an OH stretching vibration also increased after photoirradiation.This indicated the generation of H 2 O by the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 by H 2 (CO 2 H 2 f CO H 2 O). Figure 10 shows the difference IR spectra of the adsorbed species on Ga 2 O 3 (a) after the introduction of 10.0 kPa of H 2 , (b) after the introduction of 6.0 kPa of CO 2 , (c) under photoirradiation for 1 h, and (d) under photoirradiation for 12 h.When CO 2 was introduced, the bands at 1973 and 1949 cm -1 derived from Ga-H species were shifted to higher wavenumbers, and the peak of the band appeared at 1988 cm -1 .Under photoirradiation, the band at 1988 cm -1 decreased gradually and disappeared after photoirradiation for 12 h.No band was observed in the 1800-1150 cm -1 region when H 2 was introduced.When CO 2 was introduced, the bands at 1630, 1433, and 1230 cm -1 derived from the monodentate bicarbonate species and the band at 1459 cm -1 derived from the bidentate bicarbonates species were observed.Moreover, another band appeared at 1580 cm -1 .Under photoirradiation, the band at 1580 cm -1 increased in intensity, and new bands appeared at 1389 and 1361 cm -1 .In contrast, the bands derived from the monodentate and bidentate bicarbonate species decreased in intensity under photoirradiation.As the bands at 1580, 1389, and 1361 cm -1 are similar to the bands which appeared under photoirradiation shown in Figure 9, the surface intermediate may be generated from the monodentate bicarbonate species under photoirradiation.The change in the spectra in the region of 2150-1800 cm -1 indicates that the H atom of the Ga-H species reduces the monodentate bicarbonate to the surface intermediate under photoirradiation.Figure 11 illustrates the difference IR spectra of the adsorbed species on Ga 2 O 3 (a) after photoirradiation for 12 h in the presence of CO 2 and H 2 and (b) after the introduction of formaldehyde at 1.0 kPa.Bands appeared at 2982, 2922, 2792, 1575, 1384, and 1356 cm -1 after both the introduction of formaldehyde and photoirradiation.It is known that formate species are formed on a metal oxide by the adsorption of formaldehyde. 2829930313233 The bands at 2922, 1575, 1384, and 1356 cm -1 are assigned to (CH), as (CO 2 ), (CH), and s (CO 2 ) of bidentate formate species (species C in Chart 1c) on Ga 2 O 3 , respectively. 21,23usca et al. 30 confirmed that the bands of formate species on various metal oxide surfaces were complex in the 3000-2700 cm -1 region because of the fundamental (CH) band and the combinations or overtones of as (CO 2 ) and (CH).It is thought that the band at 2982 cm -1 is generated from the combination of as (CO 2 ) and (CH) and the band at 2792 cm -1 is generated from the combination of s (CO 2 ) and (CH).We concluded that the surface species for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 in the presence of H 2 is a bidentate formate species.This species decomposes into CO gas. The series of FT-IR spectra showed that the bidentate formate intermediate was decomposed to CO. Figure 12 shows the time dependence of the amount of CO gas evolved from the bidentate formate species on Ga 2 O 3 in dark or under photoirradiation.The bidentate formate species was formed by the adsorption of formaldehyde on pretreated Ga 2 O 3 at an equilibrium pressure of 1.0 kPa, followed by evacuation to remove formaldehyde in the gas phase and physisorbed on Ga 2 O 3 , as mentioned above.A negligible amount of CO gas was evolved from the surface bidentate formate on Ga 2 O 3 at 303 and 323 K in the dark; however, the amount of CO gas evolved increased dramatically on photoirradiation.It was clear that the decomposition of the bidentate formate to CO gas resulted from photoirradiation rather than from heat treatment. We propose a Langmuir-Hinshelwood-type mechanism for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 over Ga 2 O 3 in the presence of H 2 , as shown in Scheme 1.The FT-IR spectrum showed that the surface hydroxyl group remains on Ga 2 O 3 after pretreatment.A monodentate bicarbonate species is formed in the presence of CO 2 on Ga 2 O 3 .H 2 is dissociatively adsorbed on Ga 2 O 3 , and Ga-H and Ga-OH species are formed via heterolytic adsorption.Under photoirradiation, the monodentate bicarbonate species is reduced by the dissociatively adsorbed hydrogen to a bidentate formate species.The bidentate formate species on Ga 2 O 3 decomposes into CO under photoirradiation.We found that the mechanism over Ga 2 O 3 is different from the mechanisms over ZrO 2 or MgO."}], "reactor type": [], "operation mode": []}}
