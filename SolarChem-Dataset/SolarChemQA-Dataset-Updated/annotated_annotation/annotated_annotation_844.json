Further structural information about the ZnM-LDHs was obtained by TEM.All the ZnM-LDHs were in the form of crystalline nanosheets (Fig. 1c and S5 (online)), in good accord with the XRD results.The nanosheet morphology was either irregular platelets or belts, with individual sheets composed of nanocrystallites (Fig. 1d).High resolution TEM (HRTEM) images of the nanocrystallites revealed that they possessed a single-crystal nature.The sets lattice fringes were observed (spacings all 0.26 nm), and were oriented at an angle of 120with respect to each other.This indicated that (0 0 1) facets were the dominant exposed plane, which guided the development of models of the surface structure of the ZnM-LDHs (Figs.S6, S7 online) 22,23.The preferential exposure of (0 0 1) facets meant that tri/tetravalent metal cations in LDH brucite layers were available for surface reactions, making the ZnM-LDH nanosheets an ideal model system to examine the effect of various trivalent and tetravalent cations on photocatalytic CO 2 reduction. As shown in Fig. 2a andb, the products of the reactions of CO 2 and H 2 O over the different ZnM-LDHs under full spectrum irradiation varied greatly.ZnTi-LDH had a high selectivity to CH 4 (68, 1.2 lmol g A1 h A1 ) and a moderate selectivity to H 2 (31, 0.7 lmol g A1 h A1 ), with only a trace amount of CO formed.Conversely for ZnAl-LDH and ZnGa-LDH, CO was the dominant product (selectivities of 90 and 78, rates of 1.3 and 1.6 lmol g A1 h A1 , respectively) with no CH 4 forming.ZnFe-LDH and ZnCo-LDH were inactive for CO 2 photoreduction, with only H 2 from water splitting being detected (rates of 1.8 and 1.1 lmol g A1 h A1 , respectively). Under pure UV irradiation (200-400 nm), similar product selectivities were realized (Fig. S8 online).This indicated that the intrinsic composition and electronic structure of ZnM-LDHs dominated product formation, rather than any wavelength-dependent properties of the LDH photocatalysts. To pinpoint the origins of the differing photocatalytic selectivities of the ZnM-LDHs, various control experiments were performed.Owing to the ''dynamic breathing\" properties LDH-based materials, interlayer CO 3 2-anions and interlayer H 2 O can be converted to CO or H 2 , respectively, under light irradiation with E E g (Fig. 2d) 24.This phenomenon can lead to false reports of the activity and selectivity of LDH photocatalyst for CO 2 reduction.We found that all the ZnM-LDH photocatalysts produced small amounts of CO and H 2 under light irradiation in an Ar atmosphere, with the ZnTi-LDH photocatalyst also producing some CH 4 (Fig. S9a online).Isotopic labelling experiments using 13 CO 2 H 2 O confirmed this result, since both 13 CH 4 and 12 CH 4 were detected as products (Fig. 2c), implying that interlayer carbonate ions were indeed a carbon source.However, the amount of interlayer CO 3 2A / H 2 O reduced over the 5 h photocatalytic testing period was negligible relative to CO 2 and H 2 O converted from the gas phase, making data correction routines to account for interlayer CO 3 2A /H 2 O conversion straightforward (Fig. S9b andc online).Subsequently, the effect of the Zn 2 /M ratio in the LDHs was investigated (from the standard ratio of 2:1 to 3:1), resulting in minimal change in the product selectivity (Fig. S10 online).Similarly, other photoreaction parameters such as the H 2 O vapor pressure, reaction temperature and reaction time had little influence on the final selectivity of each ZnM-LDH photocatalyst (Figs.S11 and S12 online).These observation suggested that the basic metal cations (M 3 or M 4 ) in the brucite layers controlled the selective conversion of CO 2 , motivating deeper mechanistic investigations below.The ZnM-LDHs maintained stable activity and product selectivities over 15 h of testing (Fig. S13 online), confirming their durability for practical applications. Generally, photocatalytic CO 2 reduction proceeds through three stages: (i) light absorption, (ii) electron-hole separation and iii) surface reactions 25.The first two stages are largely influenced by the band structure of the semiconductor, with the band alignments (especially the conduction band potential) impacting photocatalyst selectivity.Gong and co-workers reported that by modulating the conduction band (CB) potential of different photocatalysts, the CO 2 could be reduced to a number of different products 26,27.Inspired by this, we studied the band structure of the ZnM-LDHs, using Mott-Schottky plot and XPS to probe the CB and valence band (VB), respectively (Figs.S14-S16 online).As shown in Fig. 3a (online) and Table S1 (online), the absolute CB levels of all the ZnM-LDHs were all located above the redox-potentials of the CO 2 /CO, H /H 2 and CO 2 /CH 4 couples (at pH 7), indicating that the product selectivity for CO 2 reduction over the ZnM-LDHs were not simply under thermodynamic control.DFT calculations verified this result, in which little difference was found between the CB minimums (CBM) (Fig. 3b and S17 (online)).The effect of electron transfer was subsequently explored by femtosecond-resolved TA spectroscopy.As shown in Fig. 3c, positive probe peaks were observed in the range 450-700 nm for all the ZnM-LDHs (pump wavelength k 380 nm).These signals suggest electron migration from O2p (VB) to M3d/4s (CB) orbitals in the ZnM-LDHs 28,29, with mean lifetimes of the photoexcited electron ranging from 10 to 200 ps (Fig. 3d).No relationship was found between the lifetime of the charges and the products, indicating the CO 2 reduction products were not kinetically limited 30.If such a relationship did exist, the formation of CH 4 via 4 electron/4 proton transfer to CO 2 would have been enhanced at longer charge carrier lifetimes relative to the formation of CO and H 2 (both 2 electron/2 proton reduction processes).Therefore, based on the above mentioned results, the initial two processes (i and ii) appear to have little impact on the selectivity of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.This prompted us to explore possible surface factors, which might influence CO 2 adsorption and conversion pathway. The CO 2 adsorption behavior of the different ZnM-LDH surfaces was examined.Following specific surface normalization, the CO 2 uptake followed the order ZnTi-LDH ZnAl-LDH ZnGa-LDH Zn Co-LDH ZnFe-LDH, indicating that the M 3 and M 4 cations introduced diverse CO 2 adsorption affinities (Fig. S18 and Table S2 (online)).This was evident qualitatively in the CO 2 and H 2 O adsorption energies calculated for each ZnM-LDH photocatalyst, based on the assumption that the M-OH unit was the CO 2 or H 2 O binding site (Fig. S19 online).The DFT calculations revealed that the relative adsorption energies of CO 2 and H 2 O on each ZnM-LDH closely paralleled each other, with the adsorption energies decreasing in the order ZnTi-LDH ZnGa-LDH ZnAl-LDH ) ZnFe-LDH and ZnCo-LDH (Fig. S20 online).Strong CO 2 adsorption is the prerequisite for its conversion, thus the ZnTi-LDH, ZnGa-LDH and ZnAl-LDH photocatalysts were predicted to be suitable for CO 2 reduction, in agreement with the findings of the photocatalytic tests.To further explore the adsorption and activation of CO 2 on the ZnTi-LDH, ZnFe-LDH and ZnAl-LDH, in-situ DRIFTS studies were performed.CO 2 and H 2 O were pre-adsorbed on the different LDHs, followed by UV-vis irradiation for 30 min.As depicted in Fig. 4a-c 313233.Formate species (HCOO A , 1600 cm A1 ) were also identified, with HCOO A being a likely reaction intermediate in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to CH 4 and CO, respectively 34.For ZnFe-LDH, no DRIFTS peaks associated with CO 2 or its reduced intermediates were detected, confirming that it was inert for CO 2 adsorption and reduction (Fig. 4d).These observations motivated a detailed DFT studies of CO 2 reduction and H 2 evolution over the various ZnM-LDHs.As shown in Fig. 4e-g, ZnTi-LDH possessed proper formation capacities for CO, H, and methyl (CH 3 ) was preferred to be produced thus CH 4 generated.ZnAl-LDH exhibited the lowest CO formation barrier (DG 1.55 eV) and the highest H 2 formation barrier (DG 0. 79 eV), thus resulting in highly selective CO 2 reduction to CO and inhibition of H 2 evolution.For ZnFe-LDH, the barrier for CO 2 conversion was very high (DG 2.83 eV), thus H 2 (from water splitting) was the only reaction product.The experimental and computational data presented here conclusively demonstrate that M 3 or M 4 cations in ZnM-LDHs control the adsorption strengths of CO 2 and H 2 O binding, as well as those of the intermediates formed via the photoreduction of these molecules, thus dictating the selectivity of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction. In order to understand how the individual M 3 and M 4 cations exerted such strong control over CO 2 and H 2 O adsorption and their photocatalytic conversion, we applied d-band center theory.The theory has previously been successfully used to rationalize catalyst performance in a number of electrochemical reactions, including the oxygen reduction reaction and the carbon dioxide reduction reaction 35,36.To our knowledge, d-band center theory has not been widely applied to photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, making its application here relatively novel.As shown in Fig. S21 (online) and Table S3 (online), ZnTi-LDH had the closest e d to the Fermi level.The nearer the e d to the Fermi level, the stronger the influence of the surface on the adsorbate, due to easier electron injection from the surface to the adsorbed molecules 37.Accordingly, CH 4 was the main product formed during CO 2 photoreduction.ZnGa-LDH and ZnAl-LDH had e d values further from the Fermi level, indicating a diminished electron-donating capacity relative to ZnTi-LDH.For ZnFe-LDH and ZnCo-LDH, their e d were far from the Fermi level, making these photocatalysts incapable of CO 2 adsorption and activation.Thus, the d-band center position of the M 3 and M 4 cations in the ZnM-LDHs serves as an excellent descriptor of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction selectivity."}, {"llm generation": "zinc-based LDH photocatalysts", "source": "In summary, a series of zinc-based LDH photocatalysts were successfully synthesized, then applied in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction in the presence of water vapor.", "context": "In summary, a series of zinc-based LDH photocatalysts were successfully synthesized, then applied in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction in the presence of water vapor.By simply incorporating different metal cations (such as Ti 4 , Fe 3 , Co 3 , Ga 3 , or Al 3 ) in the brucite layer of ZnM-LDHs, photocatalysts with different activities and selectivities for CO 2 conversion could be obtained: ZnTi-LDH afforded a 68 selectivity to CH 4 ; ZnFe-LDH and ZnCo-LDH nearly 100 selectivity to H 2 ; ZnGa-LDH and ZnAl-LDH 78 and 90 selectivity to CO, respectively.In-situ DRIFTS measurements and DFT calculations established that d-band center positions of the M 3 and M 4 cations controlled the CO 2 adsorption strength and ultimately product selectivity.Ti 4 , Ga 3 , Al 3 with e d positions near the Fermi level promoted CO 2 absorption/activation, resulting in CO 2 photoreduction to carbon-containing products.Conversely, Fe 3 and Co 3 with d-band centers far from the Fermi level showed negligible CO 2 adsorption, exclusively evolving H 2 as a result water splitting (CO 2 reduction on these photocatalysts was negligible).Our findings clarify the role of trivalent and tetravalent metal cations in CO 2 reduction over LDH-based photocatalysts.Further, thus study lays a firm foundation for the development of novel photocatalyst systems with even higher product selectivities during CO 2 reduction (e.g., by tuning and optimizing the d-band center position to favor CH 4 , CO or other desired reduction products).

Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected on a Bruker D8 Focus X-ray diffractometer equipped with a Cu Ka radiation source (k 1.5405A) operated at 40 kV.Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images were collected on a JEOL-2100F microscope operating at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV.Samples were dispersed on hydrophilic carbon films for the TEM and HRTEM analyses.The instrument was also equipped for high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping.Quantitative EDS analyses were performed on a Hitachi S-4800 scanning electron microscope.UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra were collected on a Cary 5000 (U.S Varian) spectrometer equipped with an integrating sphere.The spectra were recorded over the wavelength range 200-800 nm.Femtosecond transient absorption (TA) spectra were collected using a timecorrelated single-photon counting technique (TCSPC 150).The excitation pulses (wavelength 300 nm) were doubled frequencies of a Mira 900 source (120 fs, 800 nm, 76 MHz).All the measurements were performed at room temperature and atmospheric pressure with solid samples.Nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms were collected at 77 K using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 gas adsorption apparatus (USA).Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface areas were calculated from the adsorption isotherm in the p/p 0 range 0.05-0.2.CO 2 adsorption isotherms were collected at 293.15 K on the same instrument. Electrochemical measurements were performed on a CHI 660B electrochemical workstation equipped with a standard threeelectrode cell.For electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements, the working electrode was a glassy carbon electrode coated with a catalyst-ink, the counter electrode was a platinum foil, and the reference electrode was a saturated Ag/AgCl electrode.KOH (1 mol L A1 , 50 mL) served as the electrolyte.The catalyst inks were prepared by dispersing a catalyst (1 mg) in a solution containing ethanol (330 lL), isopropanol (330 lL), H 2 O (320 lL) and a 5 wt Nafion solution (20 lL).Following ultrasonication for 2 h to form a uniform dispersion, 40 lL of the ink was pipetted onto the GCE and dried under an infrared lamp (the catalyst loading was 28.26 mg cm A2 , the area of the glassy carbon electrode was 0.07 cm 2 ).EIS data were collected over the frequency range 0.01-105 Hz.Mott-Schottky measurements were performed under similar conditions instead Na 2 SO 4 (0.5 mol L A1 , 100 mL) served as the electrolyte to evaluate the band positions of the catalysts. CO 2 reduction tests were performed in a custom-built Teflonlined stainless reactor with a quartz window at the top for light irradiation.The volume of the reactor chamber was 50 cm 3 .Catalyst (100 mg) and H 2 O (0.1 mL) was spread uniformly on the base of the reaction chamber.Prior to the photoreaction, the chamber was evacuated using a mechanical pump.Then, CO 2 was introduced into the chamber to achieve a pressure of 0.08 MPa.The products formed under UV-visible/UV irradiation (300 W Xe lamp, Beijing Perfectlight Co. Ltd, PLS-SXE-300UV, 200-800 nm, light intensity 5.0 W cm A2 ) were quantified at regular intervals using a Shimadzu GC-2014 (Shimadzu Co., Japan) equipped with an active-carbon-packed column (carrier gas: Ar) and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD).CO 2 and the products were analyzed by the internal standard method using Ar.Isotope tracing experiments were performed using 13 CO 2 (99.0;Sigma Aldrich) as the carbon source or D 2 O as the hydrogen source.For the isotope tracking experiments, the reactor was evacuated prior and then injected with 13 CO 2 and H 2 O or CO 2 and D 2 O (saturated to 0.18 MPa).Isotopically labeled compounds were separated and analyzed using an Agilent 7890A gas chromatograph mass spectrometer (GC-MS). A 3 A 3 A 1 supercell was adopted for all the ZnM-LDHs (M Ti, Fe, Co, Ga, Al), based on an initial structure with lattice parameters a b 90, c 120.The initial lattice parameters a, b, and c were obtained from experimental data, and verified by the DFT calculations in this work. All the DFT calculations used spin-polarized DFT within periodic boundary conditions, as implemented in the VASP package.The generalized gradient approximation in the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerh (PBE) functional was employed for the exchange-correlation energy.The energy cutoff for the plane wave was set as 400 eV, which yielded total energies converged to at least 0.001 eV per atom.The convergence criteria for the force and electronic self-consistent iteration were set to 0.02 eV A A1 and 10 A4 eV, respectively.To account for the weak interaction between CO 2 and surface, the vdW contribution to the interaction was considered with the Grimme's empirical vdW functional (DFT-D3).The strength of the interaction between the adsorbed molecule and the substrate was described by the adsorption energy, which is defined as: where E x/slab is the total energy of the slab with adsorbents in their equilibrium geometry, E slab is the total energy of the bare slab with vacuum widths of 10 A, and E x is the total energy of the free adsorbents in the vacuum condition.Therefore, the more negative the value of E ads , the stronger the adsorption.DG values of the elementary steps of CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) and the H 2 evolution reaction (HER) were calculated using the equation: where DE is the change of reaction energy directly obtained from DFT total energies, DE ZPE is the change of zero-point energy, T is the temperature (298.15K), and DS is the change in entropy.DG U AneU, where n is the number of transferred electrons and U is the electrode potential.DG pH is the correlation of the H free energy to the concentration, given by where k B is the Boltzmann constant, with the pH set to be zero corresponding to acidic conditions.Zero-point energies and the entropy of the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction intermediates were calculated from vibrational frequencies.The entropies and vibrational frequencies of molecules in the gas phase were taken from the NIST database, while the vibrational frequencies of the adsorbed intermediates were computed to obtain the ZPE contribution in the free energy expression.The vibration models of the adsorbates were computed explicitly, while the catalyst sheet was fixed (i.e., vibrations of the substrate were assumed to be negligible). The d band centers of the ZnM-LDHs were calculated from the followed equation: where E f is the Fermi energy, E is the energy with respect to the Fermi level (E f ), and qd(E) is the density of states of surface atoms at energy E."}, {"llm generation": "UV", "source": "Under pure UV irradiation (200-400 nm), similar product selectivities were realized (Fig. S8 online).", "context": "The structures of the different ZnM-LDHs (M Ti 4 , Fe 3 , Co 3 , Ga 3 and Al 3 ) were firstly explored by powder XRD.As shown in Fig. S1 (online), all the ZnM-LDHs showed the typical (0 0 3), (0 0 6), (0 0 9) and (1 1 0) reflections of a rhombohedral layered LDH structure 20.The unit cell parameters for each ZnM-LDH photocatalysts were calculated from the XRD data, using a b 2d(1 1 0) and c 3d(0 0 3).All ZnM-LDHs had a and b parameters of 0.30 nm.The c parameter was 2.16 nm for ZnTi-LDH and 2.28 nm for all the other LDHs 21.Next, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was applied to probe the valence state of the metal cations in the different ZnM-LDHs.All samples contained Zn 2 as the dominant zinc species, with ZnTi-LDH containing Ti 4 and the other ZnM-LDH photocatalysts Fe 3 , Co 3 , Al 3 or Ga 3 (Fig. S2 online).The atom ratios Zn 2 /Ti 4 or Zn 2 /M 3 in the different ZnM-LDH photocatalysts were all close to 2 (the nominal Zn/M ratio), with all elements uniformly dispersed over the LDH nanosheets (Fig. 1a, b, S3 and S4 (online)).

To pinpoint the origins of the differing photocatalytic selectivities of the ZnM-LDHs, various control experiments were performed.Owing to the ''dynamic breathing\" properties LDH-based materials, interlayer CO 3 2-anions and interlayer H 2 O can be converted to CO or H 2 , respectively, under light irradiation with E E g (Fig. 2d) 24.This phenomenon can lead to false reports of the activity and selectivity of LDH photocatalyst for CO 2 reduction.We found that all the ZnM-LDH photocatalysts produced small amounts of CO and H 2 under light irradiation in an Ar atmosphere, with the ZnTi-LDH photocatalyst also producing some CH 4 (Fig. S9a online).Isotopic labelling experiments using 13 CO 2 H 2 O confirmed this result, since both 13 CH 4 and 12 CH 4 were detected as products (Fig. 2c), implying that interlayer carbonate ions were indeed a carbon source.However, the amount of interlayer CO 3 2A / H 2 O reduced over the 5 h photocatalytic testing period was negligible relative to CO 2 and H 2 O converted from the gas phase, making data correction routines to account for interlayer CO 3 2A /H 2 O conversion straightforward (Fig. S9b andc online).Subsequently, the effect of the Zn 2 /M ratio in the LDHs was investigated (from the standard ratio of 2:1 to 3:1), resulting in minimal change in the product selectivity (Fig. S10 online).Similarly, other photoreaction parameters such as the H 2 O vapor pressure, reaction temperature and reaction time had little influence on the final selectivity of each ZnM-LDH photocatalyst (Figs.S11 and S12 online).These observation suggested that the basic metal cations (M 3 or M 4 ) in the brucite layers controlled the selective conversion of CO 2 , motivating deeper mechanistic investigations below.The ZnM-LDHs maintained stable activity and product selectivities over 15 h of testing (Fig. S13 online), confirming their durability for practical applications. Generally, photocatalytic CO 2 reduction proceeds through three stages: (i) light absorption, (ii) electron-hole separation and iii) surface reactions 25.The first two stages are largely influenced by the band structure of the semiconductor, with the band alignments (especially the conduction band potential) impacting photocatalyst selectivity.Gong and co-workers reported that by modulating the conduction band (CB) potential of different photocatalysts, the CO 2 could be reduced to a number of different products 26,27.Inspired by this, we studied the band structure of the ZnM-LDHs, using Mott-Schottky plot and XPS to probe the CB and valence band (VB), respectively (Figs.S14-S16 online).As shown in Fig. 3a (online) and Table S1 (online), the absolute CB levels of all the ZnM-LDHs were all located above the redox-potentials of the CO 2 /CO, H /H 2 and CO 2 /CH 4 couples (at pH 7), indicating that the product selectivity for CO 2 reduction over the ZnM-LDHs were not simply under thermodynamic control.DFT calculations verified this result, in which little difference was found between the CB minimums (CBM) (Fig. 3b and S17 (online)).The effect of electron transfer was subsequently explored by femtosecond-resolved TA spectroscopy.As shown in Fig. 3c, positive probe peaks were observed in the range 450-700 nm for all the ZnM-LDHs (pump wavelength k 380 nm).These signals suggest electron migration from O2p (VB) to M3d/4s (CB) orbitals in the ZnM-LDHs 28,29, with mean lifetimes of the photoexcited electron ranging from 10 to 200 ps (Fig. 3d).No relationship was found between the lifetime of the charges and the products, indicating the CO 2 reduction products were not kinetically limited 30.If such a relationship did exist, the formation of CH 4 via 4 electron/4 proton transfer to CO 2 would have been enhanced at longer charge carrier lifetimes relative to the formation of CO and H 2 (both 2 electron/2 proton reduction processes).Therefore, based on the above mentioned results, the initial two processes (i and ii) appear to have little impact on the selectivity of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.This prompted us to explore possible surface factors, which might influence CO 2 adsorption and conversion pathway. The CO 2 adsorption behavior of the different ZnM-LDH surfaces was examined.Following specific surface normalization, the CO 2 uptake followed the order ZnTi-LDH ZnAl-LDH ZnGa-LDH Zn Co-LDH ZnFe-LDH, indicating that the M 3 and M 4 cations introduced diverse CO 2 adsorption affinities (Fig. S18 and Table S2 (online)).This was evident qualitatively in the CO 2 and H 2 O adsorption energies calculated for each ZnM-LDH photocatalyst, based on the assumption that the M-OH unit was the CO 2 or H 2 O binding site (Fig. S19 online).The DFT calculations revealed that the relative adsorption energies of CO 2 and H 2 O on each ZnM-LDH closely paralleled each other, with the adsorption energies decreasing in the order ZnTi-LDH ZnGa-LDH ZnAl-LDH ) ZnFe-LDH and ZnCo-LDH (Fig. S20 online).Strong CO 2 adsorption is the prerequisite for its conversion, thus the ZnTi-LDH, ZnGa-LDH and ZnAl-LDH photocatalysts were predicted to be suitable for CO 2 reduction, in agreement with the findings of the photocatalytic tests.To further explore the adsorption and activation of CO 2 on the ZnTi-LDH, ZnFe-LDH and ZnAl-LDH, in-situ DRIFTS studies were performed.CO 2 and H 2 O were pre-adsorbed on the different LDHs, followed by UV-vis irradiation for 30 min.As depicted in Fig. 4a-c 313233.Formate species (HCOO A , 1600 cm A1 ) were also identified, with HCOO A being a likely reaction intermediate in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to CH 4 and CO, respectively 34.For ZnFe-LDH, no DRIFTS peaks associated with CO 2 or its reduced intermediates were detected, confirming that it was inert for CO 2 adsorption and reduction (Fig. 4d).These observations motivated a detailed DFT studies of CO 2 reduction and H 2 evolution over the various ZnM-LDHs.As shown in Fig. 4e-g, ZnTi-LDH possessed proper formation capacities for CO, H, and methyl (CH 3 ) was preferred to be produced thus CH 4 generated.ZnAl-LDH exhibited the lowest CO formation barrier (DG 1.55 eV) and the highest H 2 formation barrier (DG 0. 79 eV), thus resulting in highly selective CO 2 reduction to CO and inhibition of H 2 evolution.For ZnFe-LDH, the barrier for CO 2 conversion was very high (DG 2.83 eV), thus H 2 (from water splitting) was the only reaction product.The experimental and computational data presented here conclusively demonstrate that M 3 or M 4 cations in ZnM-LDHs control the adsorption strengths of CO 2 and H 2 O binding, as well as those of the intermediates formed via the photoreduction of these molecules, thus dictating the selectivity of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction. In order to understand how the individual M 3 and M 4 cations exerted such strong control over CO 2 and H 2 O adsorption and their photocatalytic conversion, we applied d-band center theory.The theory has previously been successfully used to rationalize catalyst performance in a number of electrochemical reactions, including the oxygen reduction reaction and the carbon dioxide reduction reaction 35,36.To our knowledge, d-band center theory has not been widely applied to photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, making its application here relatively novel.As shown in Fig. S21 (online) and Table S3 (online), ZnTi-LDH had the closest e d to the Fermi level.The nearer the e d to the Fermi level, the stronger the influence of the surface on the adsorbate, due to easier electron injection from the surface to the adsorbed molecules 37.Accordingly, CH 4 was the main product formed during CO 2 photoreduction.ZnGa-LDH and ZnAl-LDH had e d values further from the Fermi level, indicating a diminished electron-donating capacity relative to ZnTi-LDH.For ZnFe-LDH and ZnCo-LDH, their e d were far from the Fermi level, making these photocatalysts incapable of CO 2 adsorption and activation.Thus, the d-band center position of the M 3 and M 4 cations in the ZnM-LDHs serves as an excellent descriptor of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction selectivity."}, {"llm generation": "UV-vis", "source": "CO 2 and H 2 O were pre-adsorbed on the different LDHs, followed by UV-vis irradiation for 30 min.", "context": "The structures of the different ZnM-LDHs (M Ti 4 , Fe 3 , Co 3 , Ga 3 and Al 3 ) were firstly explored by powder XRD.As shown in Fig. S1 (online), all the ZnM-LDHs showed the typical (0 0 3), (0 0 6), (0 0 9) and (1 1 0) reflections of a rhombohedral layered LDH structure 20.The unit cell parameters for each ZnM-LDH photocatalysts were calculated from the XRD data, using a b 2d(1 1 0) and c 3d(0 0 3).All ZnM-LDHs had a and b parameters of 0.30 nm.The c parameter was 2.16 nm for ZnTi-LDH and 2.28 nm for all the other LDHs 21.Next, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was applied to probe the valence state of the metal cations in the different ZnM-LDHs.All samples contained Zn 2 as the dominant zinc species, with ZnTi-LDH containing Ti 4 and the other ZnM-LDH photocatalysts Fe 3 , Co 3 , Al 3 or Ga 3 (Fig. S2 online).The atom ratios Zn 2 /Ti 4 or Zn 2 /M 3 in the different ZnM-LDH photocatalysts were all close to 2 (the nominal Zn/M ratio), with all elements uniformly dispersed over the LDH nanosheets (Fig. 1a, b, S3 and S4 (online)). Further structural information about the ZnM-LDHs was obtained by TEM.All the ZnM-LDHs were in the form of crystalline nanosheets (Fig. 1c and S5 (online)), in good accord with the XRD results.The nanosheet morphology was either irregular platelets or belts, with individual sheets composed of nanocrystallites (Fig. 1d).High resolution TEM (HRTEM) images of the nanocrystallites revealed that they possessed a single-crystal nature.The sets lattice fringes were observed (spacings all 0.26 nm), and were oriented at an angle of 120with respect to each other.This indicated that (0 0 1) facets were the dominant exposed plane, which guided the development of models of the surface structure of the ZnM-LDHs (Figs.S6, S7 online) 22,23.The preferential exposure of (0 0 1) facets meant that tri/tetravalent metal cations in LDH brucite layers were available for surface reactions, making the ZnM-LDH nanosheets an ideal model system to examine the effect of various trivalent and tetravalent cations on photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.

Further structural information about the ZnM-LDHs was obtained by TEM.All the ZnM-LDHs were in the form of crystalline nanosheets (Fig. 1c and S5 (online)), in good accord with the XRD results.The nanosheet morphology was either irregular platelets or belts, with individual sheets composed of nanocrystallites (Fig. 1d).High resolution TEM (HRTEM) images of the nanocrystallites revealed that they possessed a single-crystal nature.The sets lattice fringes were observed (spacings all 0.26 nm), and were oriented at an angle of 120with respect to each other.This indicated that (0 0 1) facets were the dominant exposed plane, which guided the development of models of the surface structure of the ZnM-LDHs (Figs.S6, S7 online) 22,23.The preferential exposure of (0 0 1) facets meant that tri/tetravalent metal cations in LDH brucite layers were available for surface reactions, making the ZnM-LDH nanosheets an ideal model system to examine the effect of various trivalent and tetravalent cations on photocatalytic CO 2 reduction. As shown in Fig. 2a andb, the products of the reactions of CO 2 and H 2 O over the different ZnM-LDHs under full spectrum irradiation varied greatly.ZnTi-LDH had a high selectivity to CH 4 (68, 1.2 lmol g A1 h A1 ) and a moderate selectivity to H 2 (31, 0.7 lmol g A1 h A1 ), with only a trace amount of CO formed.Conversely for ZnAl-LDH and ZnGa-LDH, CO was the dominant product (selectivities of 90 and 78, rates of 1.3 and 1.6 lmol g A1 h A1 , respectively) with no CH 4 forming.ZnFe-LDH and ZnCo-LDH were inactive for CO 2 photoreduction, with only H 2 from water splitting being detected (rates of 1.8 and 1.1 lmol g A1 h A1 , respectively). Under pure UV irradiation (200-400 nm), similar product selectivities were realized (Fig. S8 online).This indicated that the intrinsic composition and electronic structure of ZnM-LDHs dominated product formation, rather than any wavelength-dependent properties of the LDH photocatalysts. To pinpoint the origins of the differing photocatalytic selectivities of the ZnM-LDHs, various control experiments were performed.Owing to the ''dynamic breathing\" properties LDH-based materials, interlayer CO 3 2-anions and interlayer H 2 O can be converted to CO or H 2 , respectively, under light irradiation with E E g (Fig. 2d) 24.This phenomenon can lead to false reports of the activity and selectivity of LDH photocatalyst for CO 2 reduction.We found that all the ZnM-LDH photocatalysts produced small amounts of CO and H 2 under light irradiation in an Ar atmosphere, with the ZnTi-LDH photocatalyst also producing some CH 4 (Fig. S9a online).Isotopic labelling experiments using 13 CO 2 H 2 O confirmed this result, since both 13 CH 4 and 12 CH 4 were detected as products (Fig. 2c), implying that interlayer carbonate ions were indeed a carbon source.However, the amount of interlayer CO 3 2A / H 2 O reduced over the 5 h photocatalytic testing period was negligible relative to CO 2 and H 2 O converted from the gas phase, making data correction routines to account for interlayer CO 3 2A /H 2 O conversion straightforward (Fig. S9b andc online).Subsequently, the effect of the Zn 2 /M ratio in the LDHs was investigated (from the standard ratio of 2:1 to 3:1), resulting in minimal change in the product selectivity (Fig. S10 online).Similarly, other photoreaction parameters such as the H 2 O vapor pressure, reaction temperature and reaction time had little influence on the final selectivity of each ZnM-LDH photocatalyst (Figs.S11 and S12 online).These observation suggested that the basic metal cations (M 3 or M 4 ) in the brucite layers controlled the selective conversion of CO 2 , motivating deeper mechanistic investigations below.The ZnM-LDHs maintained stable activity and product selectivities over 15 h of testing (Fig. S13 online), confirming their durability for practical applications. Generally, photocatalytic CO 2 reduction proceeds through three stages: (i) light absorption, (ii) electron-hole separation and iii) surface reactions 25.The first two stages are largely influenced by the band structure of the semiconductor, with the band alignments (especially the conduction band potential) impacting photocatalyst selectivity.Gong and co-workers reported that by modulating the conduction band (CB) potential of different photocatalysts, the CO 2 could be reduced to a number of different products 26,27.Inspired by this, we studied the band structure of the ZnM-LDHs, using Mott-Schottky plot and XPS to probe the CB and valence band (VB), respectively (Figs.S14-S16 online).As shown in Fig. 3a (online) and Table S1 (online), the absolute CB levels of all the ZnM-LDHs were all located above the redox-potentials of the CO 2 /CO, H /H 2 and CO 2 /CH 4 couples (at pH 7), indicating that the product selectivity for CO 2 reduction over the ZnM-LDHs were not simply under thermodynamic control.DFT calculations verified this result, in which little difference was found between the CB minimums (CBM) (Fig. 3b and S17 (online)).The effect of electron transfer was subsequently explored by femtosecond-resolved TA spectroscopy.As shown in Fig. 3c, positive probe peaks were observed in the range 450-700 nm for all the ZnM-LDHs (pump wavelength k 380 nm).These signals suggest electron migration from O2p (VB) to M3d/4s (CB) orbitals in the ZnM-LDHs 28,29, with mean lifetimes of the photoexcited electron ranging from 10 to 200 ps (Fig. 3d).No relationship was found between the lifetime of the charges and the products, indicating the CO 2 reduction products were not kinetically limited 30.If such a relationship did exist, the formation of CH 4 via 4 electron/4 proton transfer to CO 2 would have been enhanced at longer charge carrier lifetimes relative to the formation of CO and H 2 (both 2 electron/2 proton reduction processes).Therefore, based on the above mentioned results, the initial two processes (i and ii) appear to have little impact on the selectivity of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.This prompted us to explore possible surface factors, which might influence CO 2 adsorption and conversion pathway. The CO 2 adsorption behavior of the different ZnM-LDH surfaces was examined.Following specific surface normalization, the CO 2 uptake followed the order ZnTi-LDH ZnAl-LDH ZnGa-LDH Zn Co-LDH ZnFe-LDH, indicating that the M 3 and M 4 cations introduced diverse CO 2 adsorption affinities (Fig. S18 and Table S2 (online)).This was evident qualitatively in the CO 2 and H 2 O adsorption energies calculated for each ZnM-LDH photocatalyst, based on the assumption that the M-OH unit was the CO 2 or H 2 O binding site (Fig. S19 online).The DFT calculations revealed that the relative adsorption energies of CO 2 and H 2 O on each ZnM-LDH closely paralleled each other, with the adsorption energies decreasing in the order ZnTi-LDH ZnGa-LDH ZnAl-LDH ) ZnFe-LDH and ZnCo-LDH (Fig. S20 online).Strong CO 2 adsorption is the prerequisite for its conversion, thus the ZnTi-LDH, ZnGa-LDH and ZnAl-LDH photocatalysts were predicted to be suitable for CO 2 reduction, in agreement with the findings of the photocatalytic tests.To further explore the adsorption and activation of CO 2 on the ZnTi-LDH, ZnFe-LDH and ZnAl-LDH, in-situ DRIFTS studies were performed.CO 2 and H 2 O were pre-adsorbed on the different LDHs, followed by UV-vis irradiation for 30 min.As depicted in Fig. 4a-c 313233.Formate species (HCOO A , 1600 cm A1 ) were also identified, with HCOO A being a likely reaction intermediate in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to CH 4 and CO, respectively 34.For ZnFe-LDH, no DRIFTS peaks associated with CO 2 or its reduced intermediates were detected, confirming that it was inert for CO 2 adsorption and reduction (Fig. 4d).These observations motivated a detailed DFT studies of CO 2 reduction and H 2 evolution over the various ZnM-LDHs.As shown in Fig. 4e-g, ZnTi-LDH possessed proper formation capacities for CO, H, and methyl (CH 3 ) was preferred to be produced thus CH 4 generated.ZnAl-LDH exhibited the lowest CO formation barrier (DG 1.55 eV) and the highest H 2 formation barrier (DG 0. 79 eV), thus resulting in highly selective CO 2 reduction to CO and inhibition of H 2 evolution.For ZnFe-LDH, the barrier for CO 2 conversion was very high (DG 2.83 eV), thus H 2 (from water splitting) was the only reaction product.The experimental and computational data presented here conclusively demonstrate that M 3 or M 4 cations in ZnM-LDHs control the adsorption strengths of CO 2 and H 2 O binding, as well as those of the intermediates formed via the photoreduction of these molecules, thus dictating the selectivity of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction. In order to understand how the individual M 3 and M 4 cations exerted such strong control over CO 2 and H 2 O adsorption and their photocatalytic conversion, we applied d-band center theory.The theory has previously been successfully used to rationalize catalyst performance in a number of electrochemical reactions, including the oxygen reduction reaction and the carbon dioxide reduction reaction 35,36.To our knowledge, d-band center theory has not been widely applied to photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, making its application here relatively novel.As shown in Fig. S21 (online) and Table S3 (online), ZnTi-LDH had the closest e d to the Fermi level.The nearer the e d to the Fermi level, the stronger the influence of the surface on the adsorbate, due to easier electron injection from the surface to the adsorbed molecules 37.Accordingly, CH 4 was the main product formed during CO 2 photoreduction.ZnGa-LDH and ZnAl-LDH had e d values further from the Fermi level, indicating a diminished electron-donating capacity relative to ZnTi-LDH.For ZnFe-LDH and ZnCo-LDH, their e d were far from the Fermi level, making these photocatalysts incapable of CO 2 adsorption and activation.Thus, the d-band center position of the M 3 and M 4 cations in the ZnM-LDHs serves as an excellent descriptor of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction selectivity."}, {"llm generation": "Gas", "source": "In summary, a series of zinc-based LDH photocatalysts were successfully synthesized, then applied in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction in the presence of water vapor.", "context": "In summary, a series of zinc-based LDH photocatalysts were successfully synthesized, then applied in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction in the presence of water vapor.By simply incorporating different metal cations (such as Ti 4 , Fe 3 , Co 3 , Ga 3 , or Al 3 ) in the brucite layer of ZnM-LDHs, photocatalysts with different activities and selectivities for CO 2 conversion could be obtained: ZnTi-LDH afforded a 68 selectivity to CH 4 ; ZnFe-LDH and ZnCo-LDH nearly 100 selectivity to H 2 ; ZnGa-LDH and ZnAl-LDH 78 and 90 selectivity to CO, respectively.In-situ DRIFTS measurements and DFT calculations established that d-band center positions of the M 3 and M 4 cations controlled the CO 2 adsorption strength and ultimately product selectivity.Ti 4 , Ga 3 , Al 3 with e d positions near the Fermi level promoted CO 2 absorption/activation, resulting in CO 2 photoreduction to carbon-containing products.Conversely, Fe 3 and Co 3 with d-band centers far from the Fermi level showed negligible CO 2 adsorption, exclusively evolving H 2 as a result water splitting (CO 2 reduction on these photocatalysts was negligible).Our findings clarify the role of trivalent and tetravalent metal cations in CO 2 reduction over LDH-based photocatalysts.Further, thus study lays a firm foundation for the development of novel photocatalyst systems with even higher product selectivities during CO 2 reduction (e.g., by tuning and optimizing the d-band center position to favor CH 4 , CO or other desired reduction products).
