Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded using Bruker D8-Advance X-ray diffractometer with Cu-K ( 1.54178A ) radiation.The surface area, pore volume, and pore size distribution of the catalysts were determined from N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms at 77 K using Micrometrics ASAP 2020 adsorption instrument.Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy was measured by an Avantes model Avaspec-2048-TEC equipped with AvaLamp DH-S Setup.Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy was recorded on a Thermo Nicolet Avatar 360 (U S A) at room temperature using compacted KBr pellets.By using the TESCAN electron microscope (Mira III, Czech Republic) FESEM images were taken, and then surface topography and roughness of catalysts were performed using ICON atomic force microscope (BRUKER, USA).Also, a 125 W mercury vapor lamp (OSRAM, Germany) was used as the excitation source for the study of photocatalysts wavelength in the range between 300 and 700 nm. The evaluation of the photocatalytic activity of each catalyst was conducted in a batch reactor under UV-vis irradiation in the presence of water.At first, to saturate the solution, high purity CO 2 was bubbled in a three-neck flask glass vessel containing 50 mL water at a constant flow rate for 30 min (Fig. S1).Afterward, 0.05 g of each sample of ZIF-8 photocatalyst were added to the saturated water, and the emulsion was stirred for 1 h under lamp irradiation. The final liquid product was first centrifuged to eliminate the catalysts from reaction media and then analyzed by a GC-FID Agilent JW DB-ALC column instrument (Santa Clara, CA, USA).No product formation was observed neither without photocatalyst nor light, and conversely, CH 3 OH was found and measured when there was the presence of light, photocatalyst and CO 2 ."}]}}
