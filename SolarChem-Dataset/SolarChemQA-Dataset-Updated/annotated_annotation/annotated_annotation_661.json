Moreover, a distinct absorption band around 210 nm was observed which is consistent with the previously reported CQDs 51, 52.This behavior was due to the transition of the aromatic structure C-C bonds for carbon core 53.Furthermore, the CQDs demonstrated an excitation-dependent PL emission, similar to the previously reported CQDs 54, 55.The PL peaks red-shifted from 420 nm to 540 nm with the increase of the excitation wavelengths and the maximum emission intensity occurs under excitation wavelength of 325 nm.This excitation dependent PL behaviour is most likely due to the quantum confinement effect from the various size distribution of the CQDs 56.Therefore, the concentration of O 2 evolved using CQDs/Cu 2 O photocatalyst for CO 2 photoreduction was monitored.Since the background levels of N 2 and O 2 , which were present at few hundred ppm in the reactor could not be excluded, a better indicator for O 2 production from CO 2 photoreduction would be recording the volumetric ratio of O 2 /N 2 in the effluent gas as suggested in previous works 59, 60.As shown in Figure 7 2 3 h 3 2 (4) Based on the proposed mechanism, CQDs deposited on the surface of Cu 2 O play two important roles during the photocatalytic process.Firstly, they act as an electrons collector and transporter, to thoroughly extract the photogenerated electrons from the Cu 2 O, thus reducing the probability of electron-hole recombination process.In this way, the charge carriers will have more time to Similar observations were reported in previously published works 71, 72.

Figure 3 (e) presents the HRTEM image of CQDs/Cu 2 O nanocomposite where CQDs can be seen to be successfully decorated on the surface of Cu 2 O.A higher magnification of this image represented by Figure 3 (f) provides a clear picture on the distribution of the quasispherical particles representing CQDs on Cu 2 O.The SAED pattern of the composites, displayed in the inset of Figure 3 (e) shows discontinuous diffraction rings, primarily due to the presence of CQDs in the composite.The size and lattice fringes of the particles that was obtained from the HRTEM images agrees well with that of CQDs.Meanwhile, the crystals surrounded by the CQDs particles have lattice fringes of 0.25 nm, matching the lattice plane of Cu 2 O from Figure 3 (d). Figure 5 (a) presents the XPS full survey spectrum of the CQDs, where it shows the existence of C and O elements.Figure 5 (b) shows the deconvoluted peaks of C1s suggesting the existence of carbon elements in four diverse states in CQDs; C-C at 284.6 eV and attachment with oxygen functionalities such as C-O at 285.3 eV, CO at 286.1 eV, and COOH at 287.8 eV 47, 48.The O1s deconvolution spectra of CQDs shown in Figure 5 (c) is fitted with C-O, CO and COOH peaks.The presence of oxygen-functionalised groups describes the hydrophilic property of CQDs.Figure 5 (d) shows the full survey spectrum of the CQDs/Cu 2 O nanocomposite, whereby the presence of Cu2p, O1s and C1s peaks supported the presence of both Cu 2 O and CQDs in the nanocomposite.The high resolution of Cu2p spectrum of the nanocomposite (inset of Figure 5 (d)) presents two dominant peaks of Cu2p 3/2 and Cu2p 1/2 for Cu from Cu 2 O and a weak peak at 942.1 eV assigned to Cu 2 species that originates from the surface oxidation of Cu 2 O at ambient conditions 49.On analyzing the Cu2p spectrum of both Cu 2 O and Figure 5 XPS spectra of CQDs (a) Full survey, (b) C1s spectra (c) O1s spectra and XPS spectra of CQDs/Cu 2 O nanocomposite (d) Full survey (inset: Cu2p spectrum of Cu 2 O and CQDs/Cu 2 O) (e) C1s spectra, (f) O1s spectra Figure 6 (c).The narrow bandgap of the nanocomposite compared to that of pristine Cu 2 O is in accordance to the red shift in the absorption edge to higher wavelength.The PL spectra of the pure Cu 2 O and CQDs/Cu 2 O nanocomposite under the excitation wavelength of 400 nm are shown in Figure 6 (d).With the incorporation of CQDs, the emission of bare Cu 2 O has been quenched remarkably as the composite exhibited lower PL emission than that of Cu 2 O.This phenomenon suggests that the CQDs provide a secondary pathway for the transfer of photogenerated electrons at the CQDs-Cu 2 O interphase.This decreases the probability of the photoexcited electrons from recombining with the holes, hence more electrons can be consumed for the photoreduction of surface-adsorbed CO 2 species. photocatalyst showed enhanced photocatalytic performance towards CO 2 photoreduction than that of pure Cu 2 O and CQDs.In addition to that, both Cu 2 O and CQDs/Cu 2 O photocatalysts showed a similar trend in photoreduction activity whereby the maximum yield of C 2 H 6 was achieved after 3 hours of continuous light exposure and the formation started to cease gradually after that.This might be due to the utilization of catalyst active sites for the molecular adsorption-desorption process.For the accumulated C 2 H 6 generation, the CQDs/Cu 2 O nanocomposite photocatalyst attained 54 of improvement in the photoactivity with the total amount of C 2 H 6 generated of about 101.83 mol/g catalyst for 6 hours of continuous light illumination, comparing to the pure Cu 2 O photocatalyst with total amount of C 2 H 6 produced about 66.73 mol/g catalyst for the same reaction time.The improved photocatalytic performance of CQDs/Cu 2 O photocatalyst describes the role played by CQDs to facilitate the charge separation at the CQDs-Cu 2 O interphase, thereby inhibiting the recombination of electron-hole pairs, which was supported by PL results.This electron transfer mediating property of CQDs was observed in previously reported CQDs/ZnO and CQDs/SiO 2 photocatalyst systems27,58. S C R I P Tserve as reaction centers for the chemical processes69.Secondly, CQDs have large electron capacity where the redundant electrons from the Cu 2 O can be shuttled freely along their conducting network22.This reduces the possibility of self-reduction of Cu 2 O to the enhancement in the photostability of the composite70.Besides, there was no trace of molecular H 2 detected by the GC throughout the reaction time.This suggests that both H radicals and H 2 were rapidly utilized by CO 2 molecules during the photocatalytic reaction. Figure 8 Mechanism of photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 over CQDs/Cu 2 O photocatalyst photocatalyst of up to 54 compared to that of pristine Cu 2 O demonstrated that incorporation of CQDs with Cu 2 O was able to retard the recombination of the photogenerated charge carriers where CQDs serve as an electron acceptor to extract electrons from Cu 2 O.This behaviour is supported by the decrease in charge recombination rate of the CQDs/Cu 2 O nanocomposite though PL analysis.The CQDs/Cu 2 O nanocomposite also exhibited an excellent photostability under repeated cycles of photoreaction.The considerable enhancement in the photoactivity of the photoreduction by incorporating CQDs and Cu 2 O, forming CQDs/Cu 2 O nanocomposite.To date, few trials have been conducted in designing Cu 2 O-carbonaceous materials integrated photocatalyst systems for this reaction which is summarized in Table1.Cu 2 O-carbonaceuos materials integrated photocatalysts used for CO 2 photoreduction however this study will be of particular interest for the production of ethane (C 2 H 6 ) from the CO 2 conversion which has not been reported in any Cu 2 O-based photocatalyst studies before.C 2 H 6 is of great importance for various industries such as a petrochemical feedstock for ethylene production and for its tendency to accelerate fruit ripening.It is worth to note that C 2 H 6 consumes higher electrons compared to other hydrocarbon products which can be represented by equations ( As displayed in Table1, various hydrocarbon fuels have been evolved using the Cu 2 Ocarboneceus materials integrated photocatalysts depending on their experimental conditions,A C C E P T E D MA N U S C R I P T 2 O and CQDs/Cu 2 O nanocomposite, (c) Tauc's plot of CQDs (inset), Cu 2 O and CQDs/Cu 2 O nanocomposite and (d) PL spectra of Cu 2 O and CQDs/Cu 2 O nanocomposite under excitation wavelength of 400 nm 68 the trend of volumetric ratio of O 2 /N 2 as a function of time using both Cu 2 O and CQDs/Cu 2 O photocatalysts is almost similar as that of their respective C 2 H 6 formation from CO 2 photoreduction under visible light irradiation.This implies that O 2 is being generated from the oxidation of H 2 O during CO 2 photoreduction reaction.In addition, the C 2 H 6 : O 2 product stoichiometry was in the range of 1: 2.96 to 1: 3.42 (24.68 to 31.88 mol/g catalyst ) for pure Cu 2 O and 1: 3.11 to 1: 3.40 (45.94 to 52.19 mol/g catalyst ) for CQDs/Cu 2 O nanocomposite which is very close to the 1: 3.5 stoichiometry considering CO 2 photoreduction was the only catalytic process operating; CO 2 photoreduction to C 2 H 6 is a 14 e -process (2CO 2 14H 14e - C 2 H 6 4H 2 O), in contrast to the 4 e -process of water splitting (2H 2 O O 2 4H 4e -) where for each C 2 H 6 molecule formation, 3.5 molecules of O 2 are being released from water splitting process.From this, one can conclude that both Cu 2 O and CQDs/Cu 2 O may act as an efficient photocatalyst for CO 2 photoreduction.However, considering the ratio of O 2 /N 2 by CQDs/Cu 2 O always larger than by Cu 2 O suggests that CQDs/Cu 2 O was more active than Cu 2 O for O 2 production, probably due to the decoration of CQDs on Cu 2 O which enhance the adsorption of H 2 O on the catalyst surface61.In contrast, since CQDs showed very poor photoactivity to reduce CO 2 , the O 2 released was very minimal.In general, there are two possible ways of CO 2 reduction to C 2 H 6 , which is from hydrogenation of ethylene intermediate or dimerization of two CH 3 adsorbates62.However, there was no trace of methane or ethylene detected using both bare Cu 2 O and the nanocomposite throughout the reaction period.It was postulated that the formation of ethylene is more favorable on the single crystal Cu surfaces rather than polycrystalline surfaces63.Based on the SAED pattern of the pure Cu 2 O in Figure3(c) which reveals its polycrystalline nature, it is very likely that the formation of C 2 H 6 is not favorable through the hydrogenation of ethylene intermediate, therefore the other possible pathway which is through the dimerization of -CH 3 adsorbates was proposed for this study.The possible reason of methane (CH 4 ) not being detected by the GC throughout the reaction is probably due to the rapid transformation of the intermediates (CH 3 ) to C 2 H 6 .Formation of C 2 H 6 for 6 hours of reaction time over pure CQDs, Cu 2 O and CQDs/Cu 2 O nanocomposite photocatalyst, (b) Time dependence volumetric ratio of O 2 /N 2 using CQDs/Cu 2 O photocatalyst radicals react continuously in a series of reactions to form CH 3 on the catalyst surface, and finally the dimerization of two CH 3 species forms C 2 H 6 .These reactions are represented by equations (6) to(8).However, due to high recombination rate of charge carriers of Cu 2 O, most of the photogenerated electrons tend to recombine with holes in the VB of Cu 2 O and only a portion of charges would participate in the photocatalytic reaction68.When CQDs are deposited on the surface of Cu 2 O, these photogenerated charge carriers are extracted by CQDs to drive the photoreduction reaction.Therefore, in the case of CQDs/Cu 2 O it is proposed that all the reactions represented by equations (1) to (8) occur on the surface of Cu 2 O except for the photoreduction reaction shown in equation (2) which occurs on the surface of CQDs rather than on Cu 2 O.This electron mediating property of CQDs reduces the probability of electron-hole recombination process along the Cu 2 O network which is supported by the high PL quenching of the nanocomposites compared to the pure Cu 2 O.

CO 2 photoreduction to C 2 H 6 is a 14 e -process (2CO 2 14H 14e - C 2 H 6 4H 2 O), in contrast to the 4 e -process of water splitting (2H 2 O O 2 4H 4e -) where for each C 2 H 6 molecule formation, 3.5 molecules of O 2 are being released from water splitting process.From this, one can conclude that both Cu 2 O and CQDs/Cu 2 O may act as an efficient photocatalyst for CO 2 photoreduction.However, considering the ratio of O 2 /N 2 by CQDs/Cu 2 O always larger than by Cu 2 O suggests that CQDs/Cu 2 O was more active than Cu 2 O for O 2 production, probably due to the decoration of CQDs on Cu 2 O which enhance the adsorption of H 2 O on the catalyst surface61.In contrast, since CQDs showed very poor photoactivity to reduce CO 2 , the O 2 released was very minimal.In general, there are two possible ways of CO 2 reduction to C 2 H 6 , which is from hydrogenation of ethylene intermediate or dimerization of two CH 3 adsorbates62.However, there was no trace of methane or ethylene detected using both bare Cu 2 O and the nanocomposite throughout the reaction period.It was postulated that the formation of ethylene is more favorable on the single crystal Cu surfaces rather than polycrystalline surfaces63.Based on the SAED pattern of the pure Cu 2 O in Figure3(c) which reveals its polycrystalline nature, it is very likely that the formation of C 2 H 6 is not favorable through the hydrogenation of ethylene intermediate, therefore the other possible pathway which is through the dimerization of -CH 3 adsorbates was proposed for this study.The possible reason of methane (CH 4 ) not being detected by the GC throughout the reaction is probably due to the rapid transformation of the intermediates (CH 3 ) to C 2 H 6 .Formation of C 2 H 6 for 6 hours of reaction time over pure CQDs, Cu 2 O and CQDs/Cu 2 O nanocomposite photocatalyst, (b) Time dependence volumetric ratio of O 2 /N 2 using CQDs/Cu 2 O photocatalyst radicals react continuously in a series of reactions to form CH 3 on the catalyst surface, and finally the dimerization of two CH 3 species forms C 2 H 6 .These reactions are represented by equations (6) to(8).However, due to high recombination rate of charge carriers of Cu 2 O, most of the photogenerated electrons tend to recombine with holes in the VB of Cu 2 O and only a portion of charges would participate in the photocatalytic reaction68.When CQDs are deposited on the surface of Cu 2 O, these photogenerated charge carriers are extracted by CQDs to drive the photoreduction reaction.Therefore, in the case of CQDs/Cu 2 O it is proposed that all the reactions represented by equations (1) to (8) occur on the surface of Cu 2 O except for the photoreduction reaction shown in equation (2) which occurs on the surface of CQDs rather than on Cu 2 O.This electron mediating property of CQDs reduces the probability of electron-hole recombination process along the Cu 2 O network which is supported by the high PL quenching of the nanocomposites compared to the pure Cu 2 O.

Figure 8 Mechanism of photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 over CQDs/Cu 2 O photocatalyst photocatalyst of up to 54 compared to that of pristine Cu 2 O demonstrated that incorporation of CQDs with Cu 2 O was able to retard the recombination of the photogenerated charge carriers where CQDs serve as an electron acceptor to extract electrons from Cu 2 O.This behaviour is supported by the decrease in charge recombination rate of the CQDs/Cu 2 O nanocomposite though PL analysis.The CQDs/Cu 2 O nanocomposite also exhibited an excellent photostability under repeated cycles of photoreaction.The considerable enhancement in the photoactivity of the photoreduction by incorporating CQDs and Cu 2 O, forming CQDs/Cu 2 O nanocomposite.To date, few trials have been conducted in designing Cu 2 O-carbonaceous materials integrated photocatalyst systems for this reaction which is summarized in Table1.Cu 2 O-carbonaceuos materials integrated photocatalysts used for CO 2 photoreduction however this study will be of particular interest for the production of ethane (C 2 H 6 ) from the CO 2 conversion which has not been reported in any Cu 2 O-based photocatalyst studies before.C 2 H 6 is of great importance for various industries such as a petrochemical feedstock for ethylene production and for its tendency to accelerate fruit ripening.It is worth to note that C 2 H 6 consumes higher electrons compared to other hydrocarbon products which can be represented by equations ( As displayed in Table1, various hydrocarbon fuels have been evolved using the Cu 2 Ocarboneceus materials integrated photocatalysts depending on their experimental conditions,A C C E P T E D MA N U S C R I P T 2 O and CQDs/Cu 2 O nanocomposite, (c) Tauc's plot of CQDs (inset), Cu 2 O and CQDs/Cu 2 O nanocomposite and (d) PL spectra of Cu 2 O and CQDs/Cu 2 O nanocomposite under excitation wavelength of 400 nm 68 the trend of volumetric ratio of O 2 /N 2 as a function of time using both Cu 2 O and CQDs/Cu 2 O photocatalysts is almost similar as that of their respective C 2 H 6 formation from CO 2 photoreduction under visible light irradiation.This implies that O 2 is being generated from the oxidation of H 2 O during CO 2 photoreduction reaction.In addition, the C 2 H 6 : O 2 product stoichiometry was in the range of 1: 2.96 to 1: 3.42 (24.68 to 31.88 mol/g catalyst ) for pure Cu 2 O and 1: 3.11 to 1: 3.40 (45.94 to 52.19 mol/g catalyst ) for CQDs/Cu 2 O nanocomposite which is very close to the 1: 3.5 stoichiometry considering CO 2 photoreduction was the only catalytic process operating; CO 2 photoreduction to C 2 H 6 is a 14 e -process (2CO 2 14H 14e - C 2 H 6 4H 2 O), in contrast to the 4 e -process of water splitting (2H 2 O O 2 4H 4e -) where for each C 2 H 6 molecule formation, 3.5 molecules of O 2 are being released from water splitting process.From this, one can conclude that both Cu 2 O and CQDs/Cu 2 O may act as an efficient photocatalyst for CO 2 photoreduction.However, considering the ratio of O 2 /N 2 by CQDs/Cu 2 O always larger than by Cu 2 O suggests that CQDs/Cu 2 O was more active than Cu 2 O for O 2 production, probably due to the decoration of CQDs on Cu 2 O which enhance the adsorption of H 2 O on the catalyst surface61.In contrast, since CQDs showed very poor photoactivity to reduce CO 2 , the O 2 released was very minimal.In general, there are two possible ways of CO 2 reduction to C 2 H 6 , which is from hydrogenation of ethylene intermediate or dimerization of two CH 3 adsorbates62.However, there was no trace of methane or ethylene detected using both bare Cu 2 O and the nanocomposite throughout the reaction period.It was postulated that the formation of ethylene is more favorable on the single crystal Cu surfaces rather than polycrystalline surfaces63.Based on the SAED pattern of the pure Cu 2 O in Figure3(c) which reveals its polycrystalline nature, it is very likely that the formation of C 2 H 6 is not favorable through the hydrogenation of ethylene intermediate, therefore the other possible pathway which is through the dimerization of -CH 3 adsorbates was proposed for this study.The possible reason of methane (CH 4 ) not being detected by the GC throughout the reaction is probably due to the rapid transformation of the intermediates (CH 3 ) to C 2 H 6 .Formation of C 2 H 6 for 6 hours of reaction time over pure CQDs, Cu 2 O and CQDs/Cu 2 O nanocomposite photocatalyst, (b) Time dependence volumetric ratio of O 2 /N 2 using CQDs/Cu 2 O photocatalyst radicals react continuously in a series of reactions to form CH 3 on the catalyst surface, and finally the dimerization of two CH 3 species forms C 2 H 6 .These reactions are represented by equations (6) to(8).However, due to high recombination rate of charge carriers of Cu 2 O, most of the photogenerated electrons tend to recombine with holes in the VB of Cu 2 O and only a portion of charges would participate in the photocatalytic reaction68.When CQDs are deposited on the surface of Cu 2 O, these photogenerated charge carriers are extracted by CQDs to drive the photoreduction reaction.Therefore, in the case of CQDs/Cu 2 O it is proposed that all the reactions represented by equations (1) to (8) occur on the surface of Cu 2 O except for the photoreduction reaction shown in equation (2) which occurs on the surface of CQDs rather than on Cu 2 O.This electron mediating property of CQDs reduces the probability of electron-hole recombination process along the Cu 2 O network which is supported by the high PL quenching of the nanocomposites compared to the pure Cu 2 O.

Figure 8 Mechanism of photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 over CQDs/Cu 2 O photocatalyst photocatalyst of up to 54 compared to that of pristine Cu 2 O demonstrated that incorporation of CQDs with Cu 2 O was able to retard the recombination of the photogenerated charge carriers where CQDs serve as an electron acceptor to extract electrons from Cu 2 O.This behaviour is supported by the decrease in charge recombination rate of the CQDs/Cu 2 O nanocomposite though PL analysis.The CQDs/Cu 2 O nanocomposite also exhibited an excellent photostability under repeated cycles of photoreaction.The considerable enhancement in the photoactivity of the photoreduction by incorporating CQDs and Cu 2 O, forming CQDs/Cu 2 O nanocomposite.To date, few trials have been conducted in designing Cu 2 O-carbonaceous materials integrated photocatalyst systems for this reaction which is summarized in Table1.Cu 2 O-carbonaceuos materials integrated photocatalysts used for CO 2 photoreduction however this study will be of particular interest for the production of ethane (C 2 H 6 ) from the CO 2 conversion which has not been reported in any Cu 2 O-based photocatalyst studies before.C 2 H 6 is of great importance for various industries such as a petrochemical feedstock for ethylene production and for its tendency to accelerate fruit ripening.It is worth to note that C 2 H 6 consumes higher electrons compared to other hydrocarbon products which can be represented by equations ( As displayed in Table1, various hydrocarbon fuels have been evolved using the Cu 2 Ocarboneceus materials integrated photocatalysts depending on their experimental conditions,A C C E P T E D MA N U S C R I P T 2 O and CQDs/Cu 2 O nanocomposite, (c) Tauc's plot of CQDs (inset), Cu 2 O and CQDs/Cu 2 O nanocomposite and (d) PL spectra of Cu 2 O and CQDs/Cu 2 O nanocomposite under excitation wavelength of 400 nm 68 the trend of volumetric ratio of O 2 /N 2 as a function of time using both Cu 2 O and CQDs/Cu 2 O photocatalysts is almost similar as that of their respective C 2 H 6 formation from CO 2 photoreduction under visible light irradiation.This implies that O 2 is being generated from the oxidation of H 2 O during CO 2 photoreduction reaction.In addition, the C 2 H 6 : O 2 product stoichiometry was in the range of 1: 2.96 to 1: 3.42 (24.68 to 31.88 mol/g catalyst ) for pure Cu 2 O and 1: 3.11 to 1: 3.40 (45.94 to 52.19 mol/g catalyst ) for CQDs/Cu 2 O nanocomposite which is very close to the 1: 3.5 stoichiometry considering CO 2 photoreduction was the only catalytic process operating; CO 2 photoreduction to C 2 H 6 is a 14 e -process (2CO 2 14H 14e - C 2 H 6 4H 2 O), in contrast to the 4 e -process of water splitting (2H 2 O O 2 4H 4e -) where for each C 2 H 6 molecule formation, 3.5 molecules of O 2 are being released from water splitting process.From this, one can conclude that both Cu 2 O and CQDs/Cu 2 O may act as an efficient photocatalyst for CO 2 photoreduction.However, considering the ratio of O 2 /N 2 by CQDs/Cu 2 O always larger than by Cu 2 O suggests that CQDs/Cu 2 O was more active than Cu 2 O for O 2 production, probably due to the decoration of CQDs on Cu 2 O which enhance the adsorption of H 2 O on the catalyst surface61.In contrast, since CQDs showed very poor photoactivity to reduce CO 2 , the O 2 released was very minimal.In general, there are two possible ways of CO 2 reduction to C 2 H 6 , which is from hydrogenation of ethylene intermediate or dimerization of two CH 3 adsorbates62.However, there was no trace of methane or ethylene detected using both bare Cu 2 O and the nanocomposite throughout the reaction period.It was postulated that the formation of ethylene is more favorable on the single crystal Cu surfaces rather than polycrystalline surfaces63.Based on the SAED pattern of the pure Cu 2 O in Figure3(c) which reveals its polycrystalline nature, it is very likely that the formation of C 2 H 6 is not favorable through the hydrogenation of ethylene intermediate, therefore the other possible pathway which is through the dimerization of -CH 3 adsorbates was proposed for this study.The possible reason of methane (CH 4 ) not being detected by the GC throughout the reaction is probably due to the rapid transformation of the intermediates (CH 3 ) to C 2 H 6 .Formation of C 2 H 6 for 6 hours of reaction time over pure CQDs, Cu 2 O and CQDs/Cu 2 O nanocomposite photocatalyst, (b) Time dependence volumetric ratio of O 2 /N 2 using CQDs/Cu 2 O photocatalyst radicals react continuously in a series of reactions to form CH 3 on the catalyst surface, and finally the dimerization of two CH 3 species forms C 2 H 6 .These reactions are represented by equations (6) to(8).However, due to high recombination rate of charge carriers of Cu 2 O, most of the photogenerated electrons tend to recombine with holes in the VB of Cu 2 O and only a portion of charges would participate in the photocatalytic reaction68.When CQDs are deposited on the surface of Cu 2 O, these photogenerated charge carriers are extracted by CQDs to drive the photoreduction reaction.Therefore, in the case of CQDs/Cu 2 O it is proposed that all the reactions represented by equations (1) to (8) occur on the surface of Cu 2 O except for the photoreduction reaction shown in equation (2) which occurs on the surface of CQDs rather than on Cu 2 O.This electron mediating property of CQDs reduces the probability of electron-hole recombination process along the Cu 2 O network which is supported by the high PL quenching of the nanocomposites compared to the pure Cu 2 O.
