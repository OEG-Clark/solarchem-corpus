X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected on a Rigaku D/ MAX 2550 diffract meter with Cu K a radiation (k 1.5406A).UVAVis diffuse reflectance spectra were obtained on a Shimadzu UV-2450 spectrophotometer in the diffuse reflectance mode equipped with an integrating sphere with BaSO 4 as the standard for solid samples.Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were conducted on a Shimadzu RF-5301PC fluorescence spectrometer under a laser excitation of 350 nm.X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) of the samples were recorded using a Kratos AXIS Supra with Al Ka Xray radiations as the X-ray source.The binding energies were calibrated on the basis of C 1s (284.8 eV) peak.Electron spinresonance (ESR) spectra were measured on a Bruker A300 EPR Spectrometer with a digital temperature control system (Bruker ER 4131 VT).Frequency: 9.426 GHz, attenuation: 10 dB, modula-tion amplitude: 2.00 G, time constant: 81.92 ms for all spectra.For all samples, no saturation was observed within the range of the microwave power.The ESR spectra of the samples were measured at 120 K.The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) measurements of different single wavelength were performed by a CEL-NP2000 light power meter.CO 2 and CO temperature programmed desorption (TPD) tests were performed on a Finesorb-3010.Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were performed on a Hitachi SU-8010 electron microscopy.Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-angle annular dark-field STEM images were obtained on a JEM-2100F microscope with an acceleration voltage of 200 kV and a JOEL JEM-ARM 200F microscope equipped an aberration corrector.The Fourier-transform IR (FT-IR) spectra were recorded on a Bruker Vector 22 in the range of 4000-400 cm A1 . 1 H NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker AVANCE III HD-600 spectrometer at resonance frequency of 600 MHz.Mass spectra (MS) were recorded on a GCMS-QP2010 mass spectrometry.Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on an SDT Q600 Simultaneous DSC-TGA in flowing air with heating rate of 10 C/min.

DRIFT spectra were recorded using a Thermo Fisher Nicolet iS50 FT-IR spectrometer equipped with an MCT/A detector and ZnSe window, and a reaction chamber.As a typical run, 50 mg of solid sample was localized in the chamber and pretreated at 100 C for 30 min in flowing Ar (20 mL/min).Then, wet CO 2 (10 CO 2 in Ar, passing through water at room temperature) was continuously introduced to the sample under visible light irradiation, the DRIFT spectra of CO 2 adsorption and activation were recorded (Fig. 5c andS20). Raman spectra were recorded using a HR800 Raman spectrometer equipped with an Ar excitation source (k 514.532nm).For investigating the CO 2 adsorption, CO 2 was continuously introduced into the chamber, then the spectra were collected.Then, Ar was flowed to the sample to collect the signal during CO 2 desorption (Fig. 5b andS19). The CO 2 photoreduction was carried out in a Teflon-lined stainless reaction chamber (100 cm 3 ) with a quartz window at the top for light irradiation.As a typical run, 20 mg of catalyst and 5 mL of H 2 O were mixed into the reactor.The reactor was sealed and flushed five times with 1 MPa of CO 2 to remove the air, then the CO 2 gas was charged to the desired pressure of 0.18 MPa.A 300 W Xe lamp (Beijing China Education Au-light Co., Ltd, CEL-HXF300) was employed as light source, with an output light density to the catalyst location in the reactor at 0.112 W cm A2 measured by a spectroradiometer, and the wavelengths were controlled by different filters.After reaction, the composition of gas in the autoclave was analyzed with a Fu Li-9790 gas phase chromatograph (GC) equipped with thermal conductivity detector (TCD).The liquor was separated from the solid catalyst by centrifugation and analyzed by a Fu Li-9790 GC equipped with flame ionization detector (FID).To evaluate the wavelength-dependent CO 2 photoreduction performance of Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst, the wavelengths of irradiation light were controlled by long-pass cutoff filters.In the recycle tests, the solid catalyst was separated by centrifugation, washed with deionized water, dried at 80 C for 2 h, and then used in the next run."}, {"llm generation": "Cu2S/CuSx", "source": "The solvothermal treatment at moderate temperature delayed the nucleation (100 C for 12 h), forming an amorphous CuS x matrix containing partially crystallized Cu 2 S nanoparticles, denoted as Cu 2 S/CuS x .", "context": "The catalysts were synthesized by a facile and scalable method, that is the solvothermal treatment of copper acetylacetonate with CS(NH 2 ) 2 , hexamethylenetetramine (HMT), and NH 4 F in ethylene glycol, as shown in Fig. 1.The solvothermal treatment at moderate temperature delayed the nucleation (100 C for 12 h), forming an amorphous CuS x matrix containing partially crystallized Cu 2 S nanoparticles, denoted as Cu 2 S/CuS x .For comparison, the general Cu 2 S crystals (denoted as bulky Cu 2 S) were obtained by similar procedures at 200 C for 24 h for adequate crystallization. The obtained samples were characterized by a set of physical techniques.Fig. 2(a) gives XRD patterns of Cu 2 S/CuS x and bulky Cu 2 S samples, showing peaks assigned to the typical Cu 2 S structure.The Cu 2 S/CuS x exhibits much weaker intensity and larger full width at half maxima (FWHM) because of the low crystallinity that might mean the formation of abundant defects.Ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) diffuse reflectance spectra (Fig. 2b) were conducted to study the electronic band structure, and both samples have intense absorption ranging from ultraviolet to visible region with energy band gaps at 2.07 eV for Cu 2 S/CuS x and 2.18 eV for bulky Cu 2 S. Fig. 2(c) shows low-temperature (120 K) solid electron spinresonance (ESR) spectra with the signals at g 2.075, attributed to electrons trapped on the surface defects 31.Notably, the ESR signal of Cu 2 S/CuS x is much stronger than that of bulky Cu 2 S, demonstrating the abundant defects on the former catalyst.Additionally, a pretreatment with CO 2 reduced the ESR signal on Cu 2 S/ CuS x sample, exhibiting a strong CO 2 adsorption that eliminates surface defects by interacting with CO 2 , which should benefit the CO 2 reduction in the photocatalysis.Photoluminescence (PL) spectra (Fig. 2d) were used to characterize the electron-hole separation on the samples, which show obvious PL emissions at 465 nm ascribed to the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs.The PL emission intensity of Cu 2 S/CuS x is much lower than that of bulky Cu 2 S, indicating that the Cu 2 S/CuS x could more effectively hinder the electron-hole recombination than bulky Cu 2 S. Fig. 2(e) shows transient photocurrent curve of the Cu 2 S/CuS x exhibiting much higher photocurrent than bulky Cu 2 S, which reveals the fast generation and transfer of abundant electron-hole pairs on the Cu 2 S/CuS x sample under irradiation, a feature that is favorable for photocatalysis 32.X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) indicate the presence of copper and sulfur on the two samples, where the Cu LMM AES signal at 916.8 eV and S2p signals at 162.5/163.3eV are assigned to the Cu and S 2A /S 2 2A , respectively (Figs.S1-S3) 33,34.These data are the typical characteristics of Cu 2 S materials.The relative positions of valence band maximum (VBM) of Cu 2 S/CuS x determined by valence-band X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (VB XPS) is 1.33 eV (Fig. 2f).Because of the band gap of Cu 2 S/CuS x is 2.07 eV, the conduction band minimum is inferred to be A0.74 eV, which meets the thermodynamic demands for CO 2 reduction to CO (A0.53 eV) 19. Fig. 3 shows electronic microscopy images that provide direct observation of the catalyst structures.The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images (Fig. 3a, b andS4) of the Cu 2 S/CuS x show irregular morphology.Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Fig. 3c andS5) show amorphous matrix of Cu 2 S/CuS x .EDS maps (Fig. 3d-g) display that Cu and S elements are uniformly distributed on the sample.Notably, the high-resolution TEM image (Fig. 3h) gives the Cu 2 S nanoparticles with typical lattice feature of Cu 2 S(110) distributing on the amorphous matrix.By counting more than 100 nanoparticles, the diameter distribution is localized in 1.2-4.0nm with an average size at 2.4 nm.The refined geometry of Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst was further characterized by the highresolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images (Fig. 3i, j and S6), where the Cu 2 S nanoparticles could be easily distinguished from each other by the different brightness contrast.The Cu 2 S nanoparticles show the crystallized lattice as confirmed by a fast Fourier transform (FFT) analysis and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns (Figs.S5h andS7).Notably, these nanoparticles have irregular border, which might be due to the strong interaction between Cu 2 S nanoparticles and the amorphous matrix.This feature should be reasonably attributed to the synthesis procedures, where the Cu 2 S nanoparticles were crystallized from the CuS x matrix.High-resolution STEM images of the amorphous region show atomic observation of isolated Cu sites, which randomly distribute on the CuS x matrix, in good agreement with the amorphous feature.These results confirm the proposed structure of the Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst with nanosized Cu 2 S particles on the amorphous CuS x matrix.Such structure should efficiently form Cu 2 S-CuS x heterojunctions and abundant defects.In contrast, the bulky Cu 2 S sample has highly crystallized nanoparticles with diameter at 30-100 nm (Figs.S8 and S9). The catalysis of various catalysts was evaluated in the CO 2 reduction under visible light irradiation (400-780 nm) at room temperature.The CO and H 2 generation rates of the Cu-based catalysts are shown in Fig. 4(a).The blank run without irradiation failed to convert CO 2 (Fig. S10).The referenced catalysts such as Cu, Cu 2 O, and CuO are poorly active, giving extremely low CO production in a reaction for 12 h (Figs.S11 andS12) 35,36.Interestingly, the Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst efficiently catalyzed the CO 2 reduction, giving average CO productivity at 4.0 mmol h A1 with undetectable other carbon-containing products.In this process, the hydrogen generation rate was 0.47 mmol h A1 , which is much lower than that of CO, suggesting most of the hydrogen species have been utilized for the CO 2 reduction rather than HER.In addition, gaseous oxygen with yield of 2.1 mmol h A1 was detected in the emission gas, showing the average generation rate ratio of O 2 / (CO H 2 ) close to 1:2, in good agreement with the photoreaction processes involving CO 2 reduction and water oxidation reactions 11,12,15,16,18,19.To further identify the origin of the CO product, we employed the isotopically labeled 13 CO 2 as feed, giving 13 CO as the product with undetectable unlabeled CO, confirming the CO is from the reduction of 13 CO 2 feedstock (Fig. 4b).In addi-tion, the generation of O 2 and H 2 is further confirmed by the MS signals.In contrast, the bulky Cu 2 S exhibited the average CO productivity at 0.35 mmol h A1 under equivalent reaction conditions, which is much lower than that of Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst.These data mean the high activity of Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst that even outperforms catalysts containing noble metals 22,23 and Bi-based catalysts at comparable reaction conditions 15,16,37, which have been reported to be highly efficient for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction (Table S1). Fig. 4(c) shows dependences of CO and hydrogen yields on time over different catalysts.The Cu 2 S/CuS x continuously produced CO with the irradiation time, giving average CO yield of 50.5 mmol in 12 h.The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) (Fig. S13) of Cu 2 S/ CuS x appeared at 0.11 in the CO 2 reduction with photoirradiation at 420 nm, while the bulky Cu 2 S exhibited much lower AQE at 0.01.The performance of Cu 2 S/CuS x was further evaluated in the CO 2 reduction under photoirradiation with varied wavelengths (Fig. 4d).The Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst gave average CO productivity at 4.7 mmol h A1 under the photoirradiation of k 380 nm.Under visible light irradiation (k 420 nm), the average CO productivity still appeared at 4.1 mmol h A1 .The Cu 2 S/CuS x was still active even under the photoirradiation at k 550 nm, showing the CO productivity at 1.3 mmol h A1 .These data indicate that the high activity of Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst in a wide range of irradiation wavelengths.Very importantly, the Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst is stable under the reaction conditions and easily reused, exhibiting almost unchanged performances in the recycle tests (Fig. 4e).For example, the CO productivity at 4.0 mmol h A1 was still obtained in the 6th run, which is similar to that of the as-synthesized catalyst.Further characterizations using XRD, XPS, UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectrum and TEM (Figs.S14-S17) indicate the almost unchanged structure of the fresh and used Cu 2 S/CuS x catalysts, demonstrating the catalyst stability. Considering that the Cu 2 S/CuS x and bulky Cu 2 S catalysts have similar compositions of Cu and S, the remarkably distinguishable catalytic performances should be reasonably assigned to the different structures.In addition to the charge separation, the interaction between catalyst surface and CO 2 is crucial for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction 4,8,15,16.Therefore, we performed the FT-IR spectra to probe the interaction between CO 2 and catalyst surface under dark conditions.As shown in Fig. 5(a), the Cu 2 S/CuS x gave a band at 618 cm A1 assigned to the Cu-S bond 38.When CO 2 was introduced to the catalyst, an additional signal appeared at 637 cm A1 assigning to the weak Cu-O bond 39, suggesting the bonding interaction between CO 2 and the Cu species.After sweeping the catalyst with flowing Ar, the adsorbed CO 2 could be removed as confirmed by the disappearance of Cu-O signal.Under the equivalent test, the Cu-O interaction was undetectable on the bulky Cu 2 S catalyst, suggesting the negligible interaction with CO 2 .The strong interaction of CO 2 on Cu 2 S/CuS x is also confirmed by the temperature-programmed CO 2 desorption measurements (Fig. S18), which should be reasonably attributed to the abundant defects on amorphous CuS x matrix that has been identified as sites for adsorbing CO 2 . Fig. 5(b) shows in-situ Raman spectra for studying the CO 2 adsorption on the catalyst surface.The as-synthesized Cu 2 S/CuS x shows the modes at 270 and 471 cm A1 assigned to Cu-S bond 40,41.These modes were blue shifted after CO 2 adsorption, which might be due to the formation of CuA A AOCO interaction.When the feed gas was switched to Ar to remove the CO 2 on the surface, the Raman modes were shifted back to the original wavenumbers, indicating the reversibility of Cu 2 S/CuS x surface.For the bulky Cu 2 S sample, the Raman modes were unchanged during the CO 2 treat-ments (Fig. S19), due to the lack of interaction between CO 2 and the catalyst surface, which is in good agreement with the results of FT-IR study.In-situ DRIFTS under photoirradiation was performed to gain more insight into the reaction process (room temperature, visible light).When a wet CO 2 feed gas was introduced into the Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst (Fig. 5c), new bands appeared at 1392, 1531 and 1688 cm A1 and then strengthened with the irradiation time.The peak at 1392 cm A1 indicates the formation of HCOO species, which is stable on the catalyst surface and difficult to be transformed 42.The peak at 1531 cm A1 was assigned to the COOH species, an important intermediate for the CO 2 -to-CO transformation 19,43.The peak at 1688 cm A1 was attributed to the asymmetric stretching of HCO 3 44.Further reaction with irradiation led to the generation of gaseous CO with bands at 2065 and 2077 cm A1 .Because of the instability of COOH and easy decomposition to form CO. Under the equivalent in-situ DRIFTS study, the bulky Cu 2 S sample (Fig. S20) exhibits the signals of COOH (1531 cm A1 ) and HCO 3 (1692 cm A1 ), confirming the similar reaction channels with that over Cu 2 S/CuS x .However, the concentration of these intermediates on bulky Cu 2 S are much lower than those on the Cu 2 S/CuS x sample, and the band of gaseous CO was almost undetectable even in a long reaction period, which might explain the different activities on the catalysts. Based on these data, it is clearly demonstrated that the CO 2 photoreduction proceeds the chemical adsorption of CO 2 , and the proton-electron pair transfer to give COOH intermediate.Further proton-coupled electron addition leads to the decomposition of COOH to form CO and water.The CO species easily desorb from the catalyst surface to gaseous CO (Fig. S21).Such reaction pathway is very similar to those previously identified in the photocatalytic systems using Cu-based catalysts 19,45, where the hydrogen intermediate stabilization and interaction with CO 2 are regarded crucial.Following these knowledges, we investigated the hydrogen species on the catalysts by 1 H MAS NMR (Fig. 5d, S22 and S23).The blank run with Cu 2 S/CuS x in H 2 O without photoirradiation has no signal, because light is necessary for water splitting (Fig. S22).When light irradiation was induced, resonance at 1.23 ppm assigned to SH species appeared to suggest the generation of abundant protons on the catalyst under photoirradiation, which is well known as a light reaction.Introducing CO 2 to the catalyst leads to reduction of the SH signal without photoirradiation, forming new resonances at 7.98 and 9.92 ppm assigning to the HCOO and COOH species, which suggests that the protons participate in the CO 2 reduction, which is well known as a dark reaction (Fig. 5d).These results might explain the high activity for CO 2 reduction and efficient hindrance of HER on the Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst.The H species should be stabilized on the amorphous CuS x matrix, because the crystallized Cu 2 S is active for the HER 46,47, exhibiting extremely weak SH signal in the NMR test (Fig. S23).The reaction with H 2 O and CO 2 under light irradiation also gives signals of HCOO and SH species, where the signal of HCOO is stronger than that of SH, and the COOH species is almost undetectable.These phenomena are due to the transformation of COOH to gaseous CO, and the formed HCOO still exists in the reaction system because of its stability and difficulty in further transformation 48.In the dark reaction with feeding H 2 O/CO 2 , the HCOO and COOH species are almost undetectable on the bulky Cu 2 S (Fig. S23), which might be due to the weak ability to adsorb and reduce CO 2 . Further insight into the crucial role of hydrogen species in CO 2 reduction was performed by kinetic isotopic effects (KIE) study using D-labelled water (D 2 O).On the Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst, the CO production rate was decreased with D 2 O compared with that using H 2 O, giving the KIE at 1.33 (Fig. S24).This phenomenon suggests that the hydrogen intermediates control the reaction rate on the Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst, because the larger D diffuses more slowly and is less active than H.In contrast, the CO formation rate was very similar using H 2 O and D 2 O over bulky Cu 2 S catalyst, giving the KIE at 1.06, which might be explained by the weak CO 2 adsorption/activation, making it as the rate-control step that is different from that on the Cu 2 S/CuS x . Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to study the CO 2 reduction with active hydrogen species on the Cu 2 S (110) surface, S vacancies were artificially controlled to simulate the surface of highly crystallized Cu 2 S (intact Cu 2 S) and amorphous CuS x matrix with abundant defects (defect-rich Cu 2 S) (Fig. 5e, f andS25).The defect-rich surface gives the adsorption energy (E ads ) to split H species at 0.30 eV on the S site (Fig. S26), such appropriate adsorption strength should benefit the H migration on the surface of amorphous CuS x (Fig. S27).In addition, the electrons are favorably trapped at the defect sites located slightly below the conduction band edge 49.These features benefit the efficient hydrogen transfer to adsorbed CO 2 species at the defect-rich matrix.In contrast, the intact Cu 2 S surface shows much higher E ads at 1.75 eV for H adsorption on the S site (Fig. S28), such strong adsorption is unfavorable for the subsequent reaction with CO 2 species.The different H diffusion ability on the highly crystallized and defect-rich Cu 2 S surface was also confirmed experimentally by the hydrogen spillover test, which is known as proton-electron pair transfer on the reducible surface 49.By loading Pt on the Cu-based catalysts and using WO 3 to detect the spilled H species, and gaseous hydrogen was introduced to the sample, the WO 3 -mixed Pt/Cu 2 S/CuS x sample turned to dark color more rapidly than that on Pt/bulky Cu 2 S (Fig. S29).This phenomenon indicates the facile proton-electron transfer on the Cu 2 S/CuS x . The Gibbs free energy (G) profiles of the CO 2 to CO with H atom on the catalysts are provided in Fig. 5(g).The reaction starts from CO 2 adsorption, giving Gibbs free energy at A0.02 eV and 0.05 eV for the defect-rich Cu 2 S and intact Cu 2 S surface, respectively.Notably, the co-adsorption of CO 2 and H is much more feasible on the defect-rich Cu 2 S (G A1.81eV), which is well consistent with the experimental results.The diffusion of H atoms to CO 2 , leading to the consequent generation of COOH (0.20 eV) and CO (A1.25 eV) intermediates.Such feature leads to efficient CO formation on the defect-rich surface (Figs.S30-S32, Table S2).In contrast, the transformation of CO 2 to CO on the bulky Cu 2 S catalyst, need to overcome higher energy barriers for the coadsorption of CO 2 and H (G 1.43 eV), resulting into poor CO yield in the experimental tests."}, {"llm generation": "bulky Cu2S", "source": "For comparison, the general Cu 2 S crystals (denoted as bulky Cu 2 S) were obtained by similar procedures at 200 C for 24 h for adequate crystallization.", "context": "The catalysts were synthesized by a facile and scalable method, that is the solvothermal treatment of copper acetylacetonate with CS(NH 2 ) 2 , hexamethylenetetramine (HMT), and NH 4 F in ethylene glycol, as shown in Fig. 1.The solvothermal treatment at moderate temperature delayed the nucleation (100 C for 12 h), forming an amorphous CuS x matrix containing partially crystallized Cu 2 S nanoparticles, denoted as Cu 2 S/CuS x .For comparison, the general Cu 2 S crystals (denoted as bulky Cu 2 S) were obtained by similar procedures at 200 C for 24 h for adequate crystallization.

Fig. 2(e) shows transient photocurrent curve of the Cu 2 S/CuS x exhibiting much higher photocurrent than bulky Cu 2 S, which reveals the fast generation and transfer of abundant electron-hole pairs on the Cu 2 S/CuS x sample under irradiation, a feature that is favorable for photocatalysis 32.X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) indicate the presence of copper and sulfur on the two samples, where the Cu LMM AES signal at 916.8 eV and S2p signals at 162.5/163.3eV are assigned to the Cu and S 2A /S 2 2A , respectively (Figs.S1-S3) 33,34.These data are the typical characteristics of Cu 2 S materials.The relative positions of valence band maximum (VBM) of Cu 2 S/CuS x determined by valence-band X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (VB XPS) is 1.33 eV (Fig. 2f).Because of the band gap of Cu 2 S/CuS x is 2.07 eV, the conduction band minimum is inferred to be A0.74 eV, which meets the thermodynamic demands for CO 2 reduction to CO (A0.53 eV) 19. Fig. 3 shows electronic microscopy images that provide direct observation of the catalyst structures.The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images (Fig. 3a, b andS4) of the Cu 2 S/CuS x show irregular morphology.Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Fig. 3c andS5) show amorphous matrix of Cu 2 S/CuS x .EDS maps (Fig. 3d-g) display that Cu and S elements are uniformly distributed on the sample.Notably, the high-resolution TEM image (Fig. 3h) gives the Cu 2 S nanoparticles with typical lattice feature of Cu 2 S(110) distributing on the amorphous matrix.By counting more than 100 nanoparticles, the diameter distribution is localized in 1.2-4.0nm with an average size at 2.4 nm.The refined geometry of Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst was further characterized by the highresolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images (Fig. 3i, j and S6), where the Cu 2 S nanoparticles could be easily distinguished from each other by the different brightness contrast.The Cu 2 S nanoparticles show the crystallized lattice as confirmed by a fast Fourier transform (FFT) analysis and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns (Figs.S5h andS7).Notably, these nanoparticles have irregular border, which might be due to the strong interaction between Cu 2 S nanoparticles and the amorphous matrix.This feature should be reasonably attributed to the synthesis procedures, where the Cu 2 S nanoparticles were crystallized from the CuS x matrix.High-resolution STEM images of the amorphous region show atomic observation of isolated Cu sites, which randomly distribute on the CuS x matrix, in good agreement with the amorphous feature.These results confirm the proposed structure of the Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst with nanosized Cu 2 S particles on the amorphous CuS x matrix.Such structure should efficiently form Cu 2 S-CuS x heterojunctions and abundant defects.In contrast, the bulky Cu 2 S sample has highly crystallized nanoparticles with diameter at 30-100 nm (Figs.S8 and S9). The catalysis of various catalysts was evaluated in the CO 2 reduction under visible light irradiation (400-780 nm) at room temperature.The CO and H 2 generation rates of the Cu-based catalysts are shown in Fig. 4(a).The blank run without irradiation failed to convert CO 2 (Fig. S10).The referenced catalysts such as Cu, Cu 2 O, and CuO are poorly active, giving extremely low CO production in a reaction for 12 h (Figs.S11 andS12) 35,36.Interestingly, the Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst efficiently catalyzed the CO 2 reduction, giving average CO productivity at 4.0 mmol h A1 with undetectable other carbon-containing products.In this process, the hydrogen generation rate was 0.47 mmol h A1 , which is much lower than that of CO, suggesting most of the hydrogen species have been utilized for the CO 2 reduction rather than HER.In addition, gaseous oxygen with yield of 2.1 mmol h A1 was detected in the emission gas, showing the average generation rate ratio of O 2 / (CO H 2 ) close to 1:2, in good agreement with the photoreaction processes involving CO 2 reduction and water oxidation reactions 11,12,15,16,18,19.To further identify the origin of the CO product, we employed the isotopically labeled 13 CO 2 as feed, giving 13 CO as the product with undetectable unlabeled CO, confirming the CO is from the reduction of 13 CO 2 feedstock (Fig. 4b).In addi-tion, the generation of O 2 and H 2 is further confirmed by the MS signals.In contrast, the bulky Cu 2 S exhibited the average CO productivity at 0.35 mmol h A1 under equivalent reaction conditions, which is much lower than that of Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst.These data mean the high activity of Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst that even outperforms catalysts containing noble metals 22,23 and Bi-based catalysts at comparable reaction conditions 15,16,37, which have been reported to be highly efficient for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction (Table S1). Fig. 4(c) shows dependences of CO and hydrogen yields on time over different catalysts.The Cu 2 S/CuS x continuously produced CO with the irradiation time, giving average CO yield of 50.5 mmol in 12 h.The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) (Fig. S13) of Cu 2 S/ CuS x appeared at 0.11 in the CO 2 reduction with photoirradiation at 420 nm, while the bulky Cu 2 S exhibited much lower AQE at 0.01.The performance of Cu 2 S/CuS x was further evaluated in the CO 2 reduction under photoirradiation with varied wavelengths (Fig. 4d).The Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst gave average CO productivity at 4.7 mmol h A1 under the photoirradiation of k 380 nm.Under visible light irradiation (k 420 nm), the average CO productivity still appeared at 4.1 mmol h A1 .The Cu 2 S/CuS x was still active even under the photoirradiation at k 550 nm, showing the CO productivity at 1.3 mmol h A1 .These data indicate that the high activity of Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst in a wide range of irradiation wavelengths.Very importantly, the Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst is stable under the reaction conditions and easily reused, exhibiting almost unchanged performances in the recycle tests (Fig. 4e).For example, the CO productivity at 4.0 mmol h A1 was still obtained in the 6th run, which is similar to that of the as-synthesized catalyst.Further characterizations using XRD, XPS, UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectrum and TEM (Figs.S14-S17) indicate the almost unchanged structure of the fresh and used Cu 2 S/CuS x catalysts, demonstrating the catalyst stability. Considering that the Cu 2 S/CuS x and bulky Cu 2 S catalysts have similar compositions of Cu and S, the remarkably distinguishable catalytic performances should be reasonably assigned to the different structures.In addition to the charge separation, the interaction between catalyst surface and CO 2 is crucial for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction 4,8,15,16.Therefore, we performed the FT-IR spectra to probe the interaction between CO 2 and catalyst surface under dark conditions.As shown in Fig. 5(a), the Cu 2 S/CuS x gave a band at 618 cm A1 assigned to the Cu-S bond 38.When CO 2 was introduced to the catalyst, an additional signal appeared at 637 cm A1 assigning to the weak Cu-O bond 39, suggesting the bonding interaction between CO 2 and the Cu species.After sweeping the catalyst with flowing Ar, the adsorbed CO 2 could be removed as confirmed by the disappearance of Cu-O signal.Under the equivalent test, the Cu-O interaction was undetectable on the bulky Cu 2 S catalyst, suggesting the negligible interaction with CO 2 .The strong interaction of CO 2 on Cu 2 S/CuS x is also confirmed by the temperature-programmed CO 2 desorption measurements (Fig. S18), which should be reasonably attributed to the abundant defects on amorphous CuS x matrix that has been identified as sites for adsorbing CO 2 . Fig. 5(b) shows in-situ Raman spectra for studying the CO 2 adsorption on the catalyst surface.The as-synthesized Cu 2 S/CuS x shows the modes at 270 and 471 cm A1 assigned to Cu-S bond 40,41.These modes were blue shifted after CO 2 adsorption, which might be due to the formation of CuA A AOCO interaction.When the feed gas was switched to Ar to remove the CO 2 on the surface, the Raman modes were shifted back to the original wavenumbers, indicating the reversibility of Cu 2 S/CuS x surface.For the bulky Cu 2 S sample, the Raman modes were unchanged during the CO 2 treat-ments (Fig. S19), due to the lack of interaction between CO 2 and the catalyst surface, which is in good agreement with the results of FT-IR study.In-situ DRIFTS under photoirradiation was performed to gain more insight into the reaction process (room temperature, visible light).When a wet CO 2 feed gas was introduced into the Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst (Fig. 5c), new bands appeared at 1392, 1531 and 1688 cm A1 and then strengthened with the irradiation time.The peak at 1392 cm A1 indicates the formation of HCOO species, which is stable on the catalyst surface and difficult to be transformed 42.The peak at 1531 cm A1 was assigned to the COOH species, an important intermediate for the CO 2 -to-CO transformation 19,43.The peak at 1688 cm A1 was attributed to the asymmetric stretching of HCO 3 44.Further reaction with irradiation led to the generation of gaseous CO with bands at 2065 and 2077 cm A1 .Because of the instability of COOH and easy decomposition to form CO. Under the equivalent in-situ DRIFTS study, the bulky Cu 2 S sample (Fig. S20) exhibits the signals of COOH (1531 cm A1 ) and HCO 3 (1692 cm A1 ), confirming the similar reaction channels with that over Cu 2 S/CuS x .However, the concentration of these intermediates on bulky Cu 2 S are much lower than those on the Cu 2 S/CuS x sample, and the band of gaseous CO was almost undetectable even in a long reaction period, which might explain the different activities on the catalysts. Based on these data, it is clearly demonstrated that the CO 2 photoreduction proceeds the chemical adsorption of CO 2 , and the proton-electron pair transfer to give COOH intermediate.Further proton-coupled electron addition leads to the decomposition of COOH to form CO and water.The CO species easily desorb from the catalyst surface to gaseous CO (Fig. S21).Such reaction pathway is very similar to those previously identified in the photocatalytic systems using Cu-based catalysts 19,45, where the hydrogen intermediate stabilization and interaction with CO 2 are regarded crucial.Following these knowledges, we investigated the hydrogen species on the catalysts by 1 H MAS NMR (Fig. 5d, S22 and S23).The blank run with Cu 2 S/CuS x in H 2 O without photoirradiation has no signal, because light is necessary for water splitting (Fig. S22).When light irradiation was induced, resonance at 1.23 ppm assigned to SH species appeared to suggest the generation of abundant protons on the catalyst under photoirradiation, which is well known as a light reaction.Introducing CO 2 to the catalyst leads to reduction of the SH signal without photoirradiation, forming new resonances at 7.98 and 9.92 ppm assigning to the HCOO and COOH species, which suggests that the protons participate in the CO 2 reduction, which is well known as a dark reaction (Fig. 5d).These results might explain the high activity for CO 2 reduction and efficient hindrance of HER on the Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst.The H species should be stabilized on the amorphous CuS x matrix, because the crystallized Cu 2 S is active for the HER 46,47, exhibiting extremely weak SH signal in the NMR test (Fig. S23).The reaction with H 2 O and CO 2 under light irradiation also gives signals of HCOO and SH species, where the signal of HCOO is stronger than that of SH, and the COOH species is almost undetectable.These phenomena are due to the transformation of COOH to gaseous CO, and the formed HCOO still exists in the reaction system because of its stability and difficulty in further transformation 48.In the dark reaction with feeding H 2 O/CO 2 , the HCOO and COOH species are almost undetectable on the bulky Cu 2 S (Fig. S23), which might be due to the weak ability to adsorb and reduce CO 2 . Further insight into the crucial role of hydrogen species in CO 2 reduction was performed by kinetic isotopic effects (KIE) study using D-labelled water (D 2 O).On the Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst, the CO production rate was decreased with D 2 O compared with that using H 2 O, giving the KIE at 1.33 (Fig. S24).This phenomenon suggests that the hydrogen intermediates control the reaction rate on the Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst, because the larger D diffuses more slowly and is less active than H.In contrast, the CO formation rate was very similar using H 2 O and D 2 O over bulky Cu 2 S catalyst, giving the KIE at 1.06, which might be explained by the weak CO 2 adsorption/activation, making it as the rate-control step that is different from that on the Cu 2 S/CuS x . Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to study the CO 2 reduction with active hydrogen species on the Cu 2 S (110) surface, S vacancies were artificially controlled to simulate the surface of highly crystallized Cu 2 S (intact Cu 2 S) and amorphous CuS x matrix with abundant defects (defect-rich Cu 2 S) (Fig. 5e, f andS25).The defect-rich surface gives the adsorption energy (E ads ) to split H species at 0.30 eV on the S site (Fig. S26), such appropriate adsorption strength should benefit the H migration on the surface of amorphous CuS x (Fig. S27).In addition, the electrons are favorably trapped at the defect sites located slightly below the conduction band edge 49.These features benefit the efficient hydrogen transfer to adsorbed CO 2 species at the defect-rich matrix.In contrast, the intact Cu 2 S surface shows much higher E ads at 1.75 eV for H adsorption on the S site (Fig. S28), such strong adsorption is unfavorable for the subsequent reaction with CO 2 species.The different H diffusion ability on the highly crystallized and defect-rich Cu 2 S surface was also confirmed experimentally by the hydrogen spillover test, which is known as proton-electron pair transfer on the reducible surface 49.By loading Pt on the Cu-based catalysts and using WO 3 to detect the spilled H species, and gaseous hydrogen was introduced to the sample, the WO 3 -mixed Pt/Cu 2 S/CuS x sample turned to dark color more rapidly than that on Pt/bulky Cu 2 S (Fig. S29).This phenomenon indicates the facile proton-electron transfer on the Cu 2 S/CuS x . The Gibbs free energy (G) profiles of the CO 2 to CO with H atom on the catalysts are provided in Fig. 5(g).The reaction starts from CO 2 adsorption, giving Gibbs free energy at A0.02 eV and 0.05 eV for the defect-rich Cu 2 S and intact Cu 2 S surface, respectively.Notably, the co-adsorption of CO 2 and H is much more feasible on the defect-rich Cu 2 S (G A1.81eV), which is well consistent with the experimental results.The diffusion of H atoms to CO 2 , leading to the consequent generation of COOH (0.20 eV) and CO (A1.25 eV) intermediates.Such feature leads to efficient CO formation on the defect-rich surface (Figs.S30-S32, Table S2).In contrast, the transformation of CO 2 to CO on the bulky Cu 2 S catalyst, need to overcome higher energy barriers for the coadsorption of CO 2 and H (G 1.43 eV), resulting into poor CO yield in the experimental tests."}, {"llm generation": "noble metals", "source": "These data mean the high activity of Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst that even outperforms catalysts containing noble metals 22,23 and Bi-based catalysts at comparable reaction conditions 15,16,37, which have been reported to be highly efficient for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction (Table S1).", "context": "The catalysts were synthesized by a facile and scalable method, that is the solvothermal treatment of copper acetylacetonate with CS(NH 2 ) 2 , hexamethylenetetramine (HMT), and NH 4 F in ethylene glycol, as shown in Fig. 1.The solvothermal treatment at moderate temperature delayed the nucleation (100 C for 12 h), forming an amorphous CuS x matrix containing partially crystallized Cu 2 S nanoparticles, denoted as Cu 2 S/CuS x .For comparison, the general Cu 2 S crystals (denoted as bulky Cu 2 S) were obtained by similar procedures at 200 C for 24 h for adequate crystallization. The obtained samples were characterized by a set of physical techniques.Fig. 2(a) gives XRD patterns of Cu 2 S/CuS x and bulky Cu 2 S samples, showing peaks assigned to the typical Cu 2 S structure.The Cu 2 S/CuS x exhibits much weaker intensity and larger full width at half maxima (FWHM) because of the low crystallinity that might mean the formation of abundant defects.Ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) diffuse reflectance spectra (Fig. 2b) were conducted to study the electronic band structure, and both samples have intense absorption ranging from ultraviolet to visible region with energy band gaps at 2.07 eV for Cu 2 S/CuS x and 2.18 eV for bulky Cu 2 S. Fig. 2(c) shows low-temperature (120 K) solid electron spinresonance (ESR) spectra with the signals at g 2.075, attributed to electrons trapped on the surface defects 31.Notably, the ESR signal of Cu 2 S/CuS x is much stronger than that of bulky Cu 2 S, demonstrating the abundant defects on the former catalyst.Additionally, a pretreatment with CO 2 reduced the ESR signal on Cu 2 S/ CuS x sample, exhibiting a strong CO 2 adsorption that eliminates surface defects by interacting with CO 2 , which should benefit the CO 2 reduction in the photocatalysis.Photoluminescence (PL) spectra (Fig. 2d) were used to characterize the electron-hole separation on the samples, which show obvious PL emissions at 465 nm ascribed to the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs.The PL emission intensity of Cu 2 S/CuS x is much lower than that of bulky Cu 2 S, indicating that the Cu 2 S/CuS x could more effectively hinder the electron-hole recombination than bulky Cu 2 S. Fig. 2(e) shows transient photocurrent curve of the Cu 2 S/CuS x exhibiting much higher photocurrent than bulky Cu 2 S, which reveals the fast generation and transfer of abundant electron-hole pairs on the Cu 2 S/CuS x sample under irradiation, a feature that is favorable for photocatalysis 32.X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) indicate the presence of copper and sulfur on the two samples, where the Cu LMM AES signal at 916.8 eV and S2p signals at 162.5/163.3eV are assigned to the Cu and S 2A /S 2 2A , respectively (Figs.S1-S3) 33,34.These data are the typical characteristics of Cu 2 S materials.The relative positions of valence band maximum (VBM) of Cu 2 S/CuS x determined by valence-band X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (VB XPS) is 1.33 eV (Fig. 2f).Because of the band gap of Cu 2 S/CuS x is 2.07 eV, the conduction band minimum is inferred to be A0.74 eV, which meets the thermodynamic demands for CO 2 reduction to CO (A0.53 eV) 19. Fig. 3 shows electronic microscopy images that provide direct observation of the catalyst structures.The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images (Fig. 3a, b andS4) of the Cu 2 S/CuS x show irregular morphology.Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Fig. 3c andS5) show amorphous matrix of Cu 2 S/CuS x .EDS maps (Fig. 3d-g) display that Cu and S elements are uniformly distributed on the sample.Notably, the high-resolution TEM image (Fig. 3h) gives the Cu 2 S nanoparticles with typical lattice feature of Cu 2 S(110) distributing on the amorphous matrix.By counting more than 100 nanoparticles, the diameter distribution is localized in 1.2-4.0nm with an average size at 2.4 nm.The refined geometry of Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst was further characterized by the highresolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images (Fig. 3i, j and S6), where the Cu 2 S nanoparticles could be easily distinguished from each other by the different brightness contrast.The Cu 2 S nanoparticles show the crystallized lattice as confirmed by a fast Fourier transform (FFT) analysis and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns (Figs.S5h andS7).Notably, these nanoparticles have irregular border, which might be due to the strong interaction between Cu 2 S nanoparticles and the amorphous matrix.This feature should be reasonably attributed to the synthesis procedures, where the Cu 2 S nanoparticles were crystallized from the CuS x matrix.High-resolution STEM images of the amorphous region show atomic observation of isolated Cu sites, which randomly distribute on the CuS x matrix, in good agreement with the amorphous feature.These results confirm the proposed structure of the Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst with nanosized Cu 2 S particles on the amorphous CuS x matrix.Such structure should efficiently form Cu 2 S-CuS x heterojunctions and abundant defects.In contrast, the bulky Cu 2 S sample has highly crystallized nanoparticles with diameter at 30-100 nm (Figs.S8 and S9). The catalysis of various catalysts was evaluated in the CO 2 reduction under visible light irradiation (400-780 nm) at room temperature.The CO and H 2 generation rates of the Cu-based catalysts are shown in Fig. 4(a).The blank run without irradiation failed to convert CO 2 (Fig. S10).The referenced catalysts such as Cu, Cu 2 O, and CuO are poorly active, giving extremely low CO production in a reaction for 12 h (Figs.S11 andS12) 35,36.Interestingly, the Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst efficiently catalyzed the CO 2 reduction, giving average CO productivity at 4.0 mmol h A1 with undetectable other carbon-containing products.In this process, the hydrogen generation rate was 0.47 mmol h A1 , which is much lower than that of CO, suggesting most of the hydrogen species have been utilized for the CO 2 reduction rather than HER.In addition, gaseous oxygen with yield of 2.1 mmol h A1 was detected in the emission gas, showing the average generation rate ratio of O 2 / (CO H 2 ) close to 1:2, in good agreement with the photoreaction processes involving CO 2 reduction and water oxidation reactions 11,12,15,16,18,19.To further identify the origin of the CO product, we employed the isotopically labeled 13 CO 2 as feed, giving 13 CO as the product with undetectable unlabeled CO, confirming the CO is from the reduction of 13 CO 2 feedstock (Fig. 4b).In addi-tion, the generation of O 2 and H 2 is further confirmed by the MS signals.In contrast, the bulky Cu 2 S exhibited the average CO productivity at 0.35 mmol h A1 under equivalent reaction conditions, which is much lower than that of Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst.These data mean the high activity of Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst that even outperforms catalysts containing noble metals 22,23 and Bi-based catalysts at comparable reaction conditions 15,16,37, which have been reported to be highly efficient for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction (Table S1). Fig. 4(c) shows dependences of CO and hydrogen yields on time over different catalysts.The Cu 2 S/CuS x continuously produced CO with the irradiation time, giving average CO yield of 50.5 mmol in 12 h.The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) (Fig. S13) of Cu 2 S/ CuS x appeared at 0.11 in the CO 2 reduction with photoirradiation at 420 nm, while the bulky Cu 2 S exhibited much lower AQE at 0.01.The performance of Cu 2 S/CuS x was further evaluated in the CO 2 reduction under photoirradiation with varied wavelengths (Fig. 4d).The Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst gave average CO productivity at 4.7 mmol h A1 under the photoirradiation of k 380 nm.Under visible light irradiation (k 420 nm), the average CO productivity still appeared at 4.1 mmol h A1 .The Cu 2 S/CuS x was still active even under the photoirradiation at k 550 nm, showing the CO productivity at 1.3 mmol h A1 .These data indicate that the high activity of Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst in a wide range of irradiation wavelengths.Very importantly, the Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst is stable under the reaction conditions and easily reused, exhibiting almost unchanged performances in the recycle tests (Fig. 4e).For example, the CO productivity at 4.0 mmol h A1 was still obtained in the 6th run, which is similar to that of the as-synthesized catalyst.Further characterizations using XRD, XPS, UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectrum and TEM (Figs.S14-S17) indicate the almost unchanged structure of the fresh and used Cu 2 S/CuS x catalysts, demonstrating the catalyst stability. Considering that the Cu 2 S/CuS x and bulky Cu 2 S catalysts have similar compositions of Cu and S, the remarkably distinguishable catalytic performances should be reasonably assigned to the different structures.In addition to the charge separation, the interaction between catalyst surface and CO 2 is crucial for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction 4,8,15,16.Therefore, we performed the FT-IR spectra to probe the interaction between CO 2 and catalyst surface under dark conditions.As shown in Fig. 5(a), the Cu 2 S/CuS x gave a band at 618 cm A1 assigned to the Cu-S bond 38.When CO 2 was introduced to the catalyst, an additional signal appeared at 637 cm A1 assigning to the weak Cu-O bond 39, suggesting the bonding interaction between CO 2 and the Cu species.After sweeping the catalyst with flowing Ar, the adsorbed CO 2 could be removed as confirmed by the disappearance of Cu-O signal.Under the equivalent test, the Cu-O interaction was undetectable on the bulky Cu 2 S catalyst, suggesting the negligible interaction with CO 2 .The strong interaction of CO 2 on Cu 2 S/CuS x is also confirmed by the temperature-programmed CO 2 desorption measurements (Fig. S18), which should be reasonably attributed to the abundant defects on amorphous CuS x matrix that has been identified as sites for adsorbing CO 2 . Fig. 5(b) shows in-situ Raman spectra for studying the CO 2 adsorption on the catalyst surface.The as-synthesized Cu 2 S/CuS x shows the modes at 270 and 471 cm A1 assigned to Cu-S bond 40,41.These modes were blue shifted after CO 2 adsorption, which might be due to the formation of CuA A AOCO interaction.When the feed gas was switched to Ar to remove the CO 2 on the surface, the Raman modes were shifted back to the original wavenumbers, indicating the reversibility of Cu 2 S/CuS x surface.For the bulky Cu 2 S sample, the Raman modes were unchanged during the CO 2 treat-ments (Fig. S19), due to the lack of interaction between CO 2 and the catalyst surface, which is in good agreement with the results of FT-IR study.In-situ DRIFTS under photoirradiation was performed to gain more insight into the reaction process (room temperature, visible light).When a wet CO 2 feed gas was introduced into the Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst (Fig. 5c), new bands appeared at 1392, 1531 and 1688 cm A1 and then strengthened with the irradiation time.The peak at 1392 cm A1 indicates the formation of HCOO species, which is stable on the catalyst surface and difficult to be transformed 42.The peak at 1531 cm A1 was assigned to the COOH species, an important intermediate for the CO 2 -to-CO transformation 19,43.The peak at 1688 cm A1 was attributed to the asymmetric stretching of HCO 3 44.Further reaction with irradiation led to the generation of gaseous CO with bands at 2065 and 2077 cm A1 .Because of the instability of COOH and easy decomposition to form CO. Under the equivalent in-situ DRIFTS study, the bulky Cu 2 S sample (Fig. S20) exhibits the signals of COOH (1531 cm A1 ) and HCO 3 (1692 cm A1 ), confirming the similar reaction channels with that over Cu 2 S/CuS x .However, the concentration of these intermediates on bulky Cu 2 S are much lower than those on the Cu 2 S/CuS x sample, and the band of gaseous CO was almost undetectable even in a long reaction period, which might explain the different activities on the catalysts. Based on these data, it is clearly demonstrated that the CO 2 photoreduction proceeds the chemical adsorption of CO 2 , and the proton-electron pair transfer to give COOH intermediate.Further proton-coupled electron addition leads to the decomposition of COOH to form CO and water.The CO species easily desorb from the catalyst surface to gaseous CO (Fig. S21).Such reaction pathway is very similar to those previously identified in the photocatalytic systems using Cu-based catalysts 19,45, where the hydrogen intermediate stabilization and interaction with CO 2 are regarded crucial.Following these knowledges, we investigated the hydrogen species on the catalysts by 1 H MAS NMR (Fig. 5d, S22 and S23).The blank run with Cu 2 S/CuS x in H 2 O without photoirradiation has no signal, because light is necessary for water splitting (Fig. S22).When light irradiation was induced, resonance at 1.23 ppm assigned to SH species appeared to suggest the generation of abundant protons on the catalyst under photoirradiation, which is well known as a light reaction.Introducing CO 2 to the catalyst leads to reduction of the SH signal without photoirradiation, forming new resonances at 7.98 and 9.92 ppm assigning to the HCOO and COOH species, which suggests that the protons participate in the CO 2 reduction, which is well known as a dark reaction (Fig. 5d).These results might explain the high activity for CO 2 reduction and efficient hindrance of HER on the Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst.The H species should be stabilized on the amorphous CuS x matrix, because the crystallized Cu 2 S is active for the HER 46,47, exhibiting extremely weak SH signal in the NMR test (Fig. S23).The reaction with H 2 O and CO 2 under light irradiation also gives signals of HCOO and SH species, where the signal of HCOO is stronger than that of SH, and the COOH species is almost undetectable.These phenomena are due to the transformation of COOH to gaseous CO, and the formed HCOO still exists in the reaction system because of its stability and difficulty in further transformation 48.In the dark reaction with feeding H 2 O/CO 2 , the HCOO and COOH species are almost undetectable on the bulky Cu 2 S (Fig. S23), which might be due to the weak ability to adsorb and reduce CO 2 . Further insight into the crucial role of hydrogen species in CO 2 reduction was performed by kinetic isotopic effects (KIE) study using D-labelled water (D 2 O).On the Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst, the CO production rate was decreased with D 2 O compared with that using H 2 O, giving the KIE at 1.33 (Fig. S24).This phenomenon suggests that the hydrogen intermediates control the reaction rate on the Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst, because the larger D diffuses more slowly and is less active than H.In contrast, the CO formation rate was very similar using H 2 O and D 2 O over bulky Cu 2 S catalyst, giving the KIE at 1.06, which might be explained by the weak CO 2 adsorption/activation, making it as the rate-control step that is different from that on the Cu 2 S/CuS x . Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to study the CO 2 reduction with active hydrogen species on the Cu 2 S (110) surface, S vacancies were artificially controlled to simulate the surface of highly crystallized Cu 2 S (intact Cu 2 S) and amorphous CuS x matrix with abundant defects (defect-rich Cu 2 S) (Fig. 5e, f andS25).The defect-rich surface gives the adsorption energy (E ads ) to split H species at 0.30 eV on the S site (Fig. S26), such appropriate adsorption strength should benefit the H migration on the surface of amorphous CuS x (Fig. S27).In addition, the electrons are favorably trapped at the defect sites located slightly below the conduction band edge 49.These features benefit the efficient hydrogen transfer to adsorbed CO 2 species at the defect-rich matrix.In contrast, the intact Cu 2 S surface shows much higher E ads at 1.75 eV for H adsorption on the S site (Fig. S28), such strong adsorption is unfavorable for the subsequent reaction with CO 2 species.The different H diffusion ability on the highly crystallized and defect-rich Cu 2 S surface was also confirmed experimentally by the hydrogen spillover test, which is known as proton-electron pair transfer on the reducible surface 49.By loading Pt on the Cu-based catalysts and using WO 3 to detect the spilled H species, and gaseous hydrogen was introduced to the sample, the WO 3 -mixed Pt/Cu 2 S/CuS x sample turned to dark color more rapidly than that on Pt/bulky Cu 2 S (Fig. S29).This phenomenon indicates the facile proton-electron transfer on the Cu 2 S/CuS x . The Gibbs free energy (G) profiles of the CO 2 to CO with H atom on the catalysts are provided in Fig. 5(g).The reaction starts from CO 2 adsorption, giving Gibbs free energy at A0.02 eV and 0.05 eV for the defect-rich Cu 2 S and intact Cu 2 S surface, respectively.Notably, the co-adsorption of CO 2 and H is much more feasible on the defect-rich Cu 2 S (G A1.81eV), which is well consistent with the experimental results.The diffusion of H atoms to CO 2 , leading to the consequent generation of COOH (0.20 eV) and CO (A1.25 eV) intermediates.Such feature leads to efficient CO formation on the defect-rich surface (Figs.S30-S32, Table S2).In contrast, the transformation of CO 2 to CO on the bulky Cu 2 S catalyst, need to overcome higher energy barriers for the coadsorption of CO 2 and H (G 1.43 eV), resulting into poor CO yield in the experimental tests."}, {"llm generation": "Bi-based catalysts", "source": "These data mean the high activity of Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst that even outperforms catalysts containing noble metals 22,23 and Bi-based catalysts at comparable reaction conditions 15,16,37, which have been reported to be highly efficient for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction (Table S1).", "context": "The catalysts were synthesized by a facile and scalable method, that is the solvothermal treatment of copper acetylacetonate with CS(NH 2 ) 2 , hexamethylenetetramine (HMT), and NH 4 F in ethylene glycol, as shown in Fig. 1.The solvothermal treatment at moderate temperature delayed the nucleation (100 C for 12 h), forming an amorphous CuS x matrix containing partially crystallized Cu 2 S nanoparticles, denoted as Cu 2 S/CuS x .For comparison, the general Cu 2 S crystals (denoted as bulky Cu 2 S) were obtained by similar procedures at 200 C for 24 h for adequate crystallization. The obtained samples were characterized by a set of physical techniques.Fig. 2(a) gives XRD patterns of Cu 2 S/CuS x and bulky Cu 2 S samples, showing peaks assigned to the typical Cu 2 S structure.The Cu 2 S/CuS x exhibits much weaker intensity and larger full width at half maxima (FWHM) because of the low crystallinity that might mean the formation of abundant defects.Ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) diffuse reflectance spectra (Fig. 2b) were conducted to study the electronic band structure, and both samples have intense absorption ranging from ultraviolet to visible region with energy band gaps at 2.07 eV for Cu 2 S/CuS x and 2.18 eV for bulky Cu 2 S. Fig. 2(c) shows low-temperature (120 K) solid electron spinresonance (ESR) spectra with the signals at g 2.075, attributed to electrons trapped on the surface defects 31.Notably, the ESR signal of Cu 2 S/CuS x is much stronger than that of bulky Cu 2 S, demonstrating the abundant defects on the former catalyst.Additionally, a pretreatment with CO 2 reduced the ESR signal on Cu 2 S/ CuS x sample, exhibiting a strong CO 2 adsorption that eliminates surface defects by interacting with CO 2 , which should benefit the CO 2 reduction in the photocatalysis.Photoluminescence (PL) spectra (Fig. 2d) were used to characterize the electron-hole separation on the samples, which show obvious PL emissions at 465 nm ascribed to the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs.The PL emission intensity of Cu 2 S/CuS x is much lower than that of bulky Cu 2 S, indicating that the Cu 2 S/CuS x could more effectively hinder the electron-hole recombination than bulky Cu 2 S. Fig. 2(e) shows transient photocurrent curve of the Cu 2 S/CuS x exhibiting much higher photocurrent than bulky Cu 2 S, which reveals the fast generation and transfer of abundant electron-hole pairs on the Cu 2 S/CuS x sample under irradiation, a feature that is favorable for photocatalysis 32.X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) indicate the presence of copper and sulfur on the two samples, where the Cu LMM AES signal at 916.8 eV and S2p signals at 162.5/163.3eV are assigned to the Cu and S 2A /S 2 2A , respectively (Figs.S1-S3) 33,34.These data are the typical characteristics of Cu 2 S materials.The relative positions of valence band maximum (VBM) of Cu 2 S/CuS x determined by valence-band X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (VB XPS) is 1.33 eV (Fig. 2f).Because of the band gap of Cu 2 S/CuS x is 2.07 eV, the conduction band minimum is inferred to be A0.74 eV, which meets the thermodynamic demands for CO 2 reduction to CO (A0.53 eV) 19. Fig. 3 shows electronic microscopy images that provide direct observation of the catalyst structures.The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images (Fig. 3a, b andS4) of the Cu 2 S/CuS x show irregular morphology.Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Fig. 3c andS5) show amorphous matrix of Cu 2 S/CuS x .EDS maps (Fig. 3d-g) display that Cu and S elements are uniformly distributed on the sample.Notably, the high-resolution TEM image (Fig. 3h) gives the Cu 2 S nanoparticles with typical lattice feature of Cu 2 S(110) distributing on the amorphous matrix.By counting more than 100 nanoparticles, the diameter distribution is localized in 1.2-4.0nm with an average size at 2.4 nm.The refined geometry of Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst was further characterized by the highresolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images (Fig. 3i, j and S6), where the Cu 2 S nanoparticles could be easily distinguished from each other by the different brightness contrast.The Cu 2 S nanoparticles show the crystallized lattice as confirmed by a fast Fourier transform (FFT) analysis and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns (Figs.S5h andS7).Notably, these nanoparticles have irregular border, which might be due to the strong interaction between Cu 2 S nanoparticles and the amorphous matrix.This feature should be reasonably attributed to the synthesis procedures, where the Cu 2 S nanoparticles were crystallized from the CuS x matrix.High-resolution STEM images of the amorphous region show atomic observation of isolated Cu sites, which randomly distribute on the CuS x matrix, in good agreement with the amorphous feature.These results confirm the proposed structure of the Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst with nanosized Cu 2 S particles on the amorphous CuS x matrix.Such structure should efficiently form Cu 2 S-CuS x heterojunctions and abundant defects.In contrast, the bulky Cu 2 S sample has highly crystallized nanoparticles with diameter at 30-100 nm (Figs.S8 and S9). The catalysis of various catalysts was evaluated in the CO 2 reduction under visible light irradiation (400-780 nm) at room temperature.The CO and H 2 generation rates of the Cu-based catalysts are shown in Fig. 4(a).The blank run without irradiation failed to convert CO 2 (Fig. S10).The referenced catalysts such as Cu, Cu 2 O, and CuO are poorly active, giving extremely low CO production in a reaction for 12 h (Figs.S11 andS12) 35,36.Interestingly, the Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst efficiently catalyzed the CO 2 reduction, giving average CO productivity at 4.0 mmol h A1 with undetectable other carbon-containing products.In this process, the hydrogen generation rate was 0.47 mmol h A1 , which is much lower than that of CO, suggesting most of the hydrogen species have been utilized for the CO 2 reduction rather than HER.In addition, gaseous oxygen with yield of 2.1 mmol h A1 was detected in the emission gas, showing the average generation rate ratio of O 2 / (CO H 2 ) close to 1:2, in good agreement with the photoreaction processes involving CO 2 reduction and water oxidation reactions 11,12,15,16,18,19.To further identify the origin of the CO product, we employed the isotopically labeled 13 CO 2 as feed, giving 13 CO as the product with undetectable unlabeled CO, confirming the CO is from the reduction of 13 CO 2 feedstock (Fig. 4b).In addi-tion, the generation of O 2 and H 2 is further confirmed by the MS signals.In contrast, the bulky Cu 2 S exhibited the average CO productivity at 0.35 mmol h A1 under equivalent reaction conditions, which is much lower than that of Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst.These data mean the high activity of Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst that even outperforms catalysts containing noble metals 22,23 and Bi-based catalysts at comparable reaction conditions 15,16,37, which have been reported to be highly efficient for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction (Table S1). Fig. 4(c) shows dependences of CO and hydrogen yields on time over different catalysts.The Cu 2 S/CuS x continuously produced CO with the irradiation time, giving average CO yield of 50.5 mmol in 12 h.The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) (Fig. S13) of Cu 2 S/ CuS x appeared at 0.11 in the CO 2 reduction with photoirradiation at 420 nm, while the bulky Cu 2 S exhibited much lower AQE at 0.01.The performance of Cu 2 S/CuS x was further evaluated in the CO 2 reduction under photoirradiation with varied wavelengths (Fig. 4d).The Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst gave average CO productivity at 4.7 mmol h A1 under the photoirradiation of k 380 nm.Under visible light irradiation (k 420 nm), the average CO productivity still appeared at 4.1 mmol h A1 .The Cu 2 S/CuS x was still active even under the photoirradiation at k 550 nm, showing the CO productivity at 1.3 mmol h A1 .These data indicate that the high activity of Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst in a wide range of irradiation wavelengths.Very importantly, the Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst is stable under the reaction conditions and easily reused, exhibiting almost unchanged performances in the recycle tests (Fig. 4e).For example, the CO productivity at 4.0 mmol h A1 was still obtained in the 6th run, which is similar to that of the as-synthesized catalyst.Further characterizations using XRD, XPS, UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectrum and TEM (Figs.S14-S17) indicate the almost unchanged structure of the fresh and used Cu 2 S/CuS x catalysts, demonstrating the catalyst stability. Considering that the Cu 2 S/CuS x and bulky Cu 2 S catalysts have similar compositions of Cu and S, the remarkably distinguishable catalytic performances should be reasonably assigned to the different structures.In addition to the charge separation, the interaction between catalyst surface and CO 2 is crucial for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction 4,8,15,16.Therefore, we performed the FT-IR spectra to probe the interaction between CO 2 and catalyst surface under dark conditions.As shown in Fig. 5(a), the Cu 2 S/CuS x gave a band at 618 cm A1 assigned to the Cu-S bond 38.When CO 2 was introduced to the catalyst, an additional signal appeared at 637 cm A1 assigning to the weak Cu-O bond 39, suggesting the bonding interaction between CO 2 and the Cu species.After sweeping the catalyst with flowing Ar, the adsorbed CO 2 could be removed as confirmed by the disappearance of Cu-O signal.Under the equivalent test, the Cu-O interaction was undetectable on the bulky Cu 2 S catalyst, suggesting the negligible interaction with CO 2 .The strong interaction of CO 2 on Cu 2 S/CuS x is also confirmed by the temperature-programmed CO 2 desorption measurements (Fig. S18), which should be reasonably attributed to the abundant defects on amorphous CuS x matrix that has been identified as sites for adsorbing CO 2 . Fig. 5(b) shows in-situ Raman spectra for studying the CO 2 adsorption on the catalyst surface.The as-synthesized Cu 2 S/CuS x shows the modes at 270 and 471 cm A1 assigned to Cu-S bond 40,41.These modes were blue shifted after CO 2 adsorption, which might be due to the formation of CuA A AOCO interaction.When the feed gas was switched to Ar to remove the CO 2 on the surface, the Raman modes were shifted back to the original wavenumbers, indicating the reversibility of Cu 2 S/CuS x surface.For the bulky Cu 2 S sample, the Raman modes were unchanged during the CO 2 treat-ments (Fig. S19), due to the lack of interaction between CO 2 and the catalyst surface, which is in good agreement with the results of FT-IR study.In-situ DRIFTS under photoirradiation was performed to gain more insight into the reaction process (room temperature, visible light).When a wet CO 2 feed gas was introduced into the Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst (Fig. 5c), new bands appeared at 1392, 1531 and 1688 cm A1 and then strengthened with the irradiation time.The peak at 1392 cm A1 indicates the formation of HCOO species, which is stable on the catalyst surface and difficult to be transformed 42.The peak at 1531 cm A1 was assigned to the COOH species, an important intermediate for the CO 2 -to-CO transformation 19,43.The peak at 1688 cm A1 was attributed to the asymmetric stretching of HCO 3 44.Further reaction with irradiation led to the generation of gaseous CO with bands at 2065 and 2077 cm A1 .Because of the instability of COOH and easy decomposition to form CO. Under the equivalent in-situ DRIFTS study, the bulky Cu 2 S sample (Fig. S20) exhibits the signals of COOH (1531 cm A1 ) and HCO 3 (1692 cm A1 ), confirming the similar reaction channels with that over Cu 2 S/CuS x .However, the concentration of these intermediates on bulky Cu 2 S are much lower than those on the Cu 2 S/CuS x sample, and the band of gaseous CO was almost undetectable even in a long reaction period, which might explain the different activities on the catalysts. Based on these data, it is clearly demonstrated that the CO 2 photoreduction proceeds the chemical adsorption of CO 2 , and the proton-electron pair transfer to give COOH intermediate.Further proton-coupled electron addition leads to the decomposition of COOH to form CO and water.The CO species easily desorb from the catalyst surface to gaseous CO (Fig. S21).Such reaction pathway is very similar to those previously identified in the photocatalytic systems using Cu-based catalysts 19,45, where the hydrogen intermediate stabilization and interaction with CO 2 are regarded crucial.Following these knowledges, we investigated the hydrogen species on the catalysts by 1 H MAS NMR (Fig. 5d, S22 and S23).The blank run with Cu 2 S/CuS x in H 2 O without photoirradiation has no signal, because light is necessary for water splitting (Fig. S22).When light irradiation was induced, resonance at 1.23 ppm assigned to SH species appeared to suggest the generation of abundant protons on the catalyst under photoirradiation, which is well known as a light reaction.Introducing CO 2 to the catalyst leads to reduction of the SH signal without photoirradiation, forming new resonances at 7.98 and 9.92 ppm assigning to the HCOO and COOH species, which suggests that the protons participate in the CO 2 reduction, which is well known as a dark reaction (Fig. 5d).These results might explain the high activity for CO 2 reduction and efficient hindrance of HER on the Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst.The H species should be stabilized on the amorphous CuS x matrix, because the crystallized Cu 2 S is active for the HER 46,47, exhibiting extremely weak SH signal in the NMR test (Fig. S23).The reaction with H 2 O and CO 2 under light irradiation also gives signals of HCOO and SH species, where the signal of HCOO is stronger than that of SH, and the COOH species is almost undetectable.These phenomena are due to the transformation of COOH to gaseous CO, and the formed HCOO still exists in the reaction system because of its stability and difficulty in further transformation 48.In the dark reaction with feeding H 2 O/CO 2 , the HCOO and COOH species are almost undetectable on the bulky Cu 2 S (Fig. S23), which might be due to the weak ability to adsorb and reduce CO 2 . Further insight into the crucial role of hydrogen species in CO 2 reduction was performed by kinetic isotopic effects (KIE) study using D-labelled water (D 2 O).On the Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst, the CO production rate was decreased with D 2 O compared with that using H 2 O, giving the KIE at 1.33 (Fig. S24).This phenomenon suggests that the hydrogen intermediates control the reaction rate on the Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst, because the larger D diffuses more slowly and is less active than H.In contrast, the CO formation rate was very similar using H 2 O and D 2 O over bulky Cu 2 S catalyst, giving the KIE at 1.06, which might be explained by the weak CO 2 adsorption/activation, making it as the rate-control step that is different from that on the Cu 2 S/CuS x . Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to study the CO 2 reduction with active hydrogen species on the Cu 2 S (110) surface, S vacancies were artificially controlled to simulate the surface of highly crystallized Cu 2 S (intact Cu 2 S) and amorphous CuS x matrix with abundant defects (defect-rich Cu 2 S) (Fig. 5e, f andS25).The defect-rich surface gives the adsorption energy (E ads ) to split H species at 0.30 eV on the S site (Fig. S26), such appropriate adsorption strength should benefit the H migration on the surface of amorphous CuS x (Fig. S27).In addition, the electrons are favorably trapped at the defect sites located slightly below the conduction band edge 49.These features benefit the efficient hydrogen transfer to adsorbed CO 2 species at the defect-rich matrix.In contrast, the intact Cu 2 S surface shows much higher E ads at 1.75 eV for H adsorption on the S site (Fig. S28), such strong adsorption is unfavorable for the subsequent reaction with CO 2 species.The different H diffusion ability on the highly crystallized and defect-rich Cu 2 S surface was also confirmed experimentally by the hydrogen spillover test, which is known as proton-electron pair transfer on the reducible surface 49.By loading Pt on the Cu-based catalysts and using WO 3 to detect the spilled H species, and gaseous hydrogen was introduced to the sample, the WO 3 -mixed Pt/Cu 2 S/CuS x sample turned to dark color more rapidly than that on Pt/bulky Cu 2 S (Fig. S29).This phenomenon indicates the facile proton-electron transfer on the Cu 2 S/CuS x . The Gibbs free energy (G) profiles of the CO 2 to CO with H atom on the catalysts are provided in Fig. 5(g).The reaction starts from CO 2 adsorption, giving Gibbs free energy at A0.02 eV and 0.05 eV for the defect-rich Cu 2 S and intact Cu 2 S surface, respectively.Notably, the co-adsorption of CO 2 and H is much more feasible on the defect-rich Cu 2 S (G A1.81eV), which is well consistent with the experimental results.The diffusion of H atoms to CO 2 , leading to the consequent generation of COOH (0.20 eV) and CO (A1.25 eV) intermediates.Such feature leads to efficient CO formation on the defect-rich surface (Figs.S30-S32, Table S2).In contrast, the transformation of CO 2 to CO on the bulky Cu 2 S catalyst, need to overcome higher energy barriers for the coadsorption of CO 2 and H (G 1.43 eV), resulting into poor CO yield in the experimental tests."}, {"llm generation": "Cu 2 S/CuS x", "source": "In summary, we designed a Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst consisting of Cu 2 S nanoparticles on amorphous CuS x matrix.", "context": "In summary, we designed a Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst consisting of Cu 2 S nanoparticles on amorphous CuS x matrix.The heterojunctions on Cu 2 S nanoparticle and CuS x matrix benefit the light harvesting and water splitting, and the amorphous CuS x surface efficiently adsorbs and activates CO 2 molecules.The stabilization and diffusion of hydrogen intermediates on the catalyst surface benefit the proton-electron transfer to CO 2 , realizing a biomimetic reaction process with high CO productivity even under visible light irradiation.This work should be helpful for the development of efficient catalysts for the CO 2 -elimination-purpose techniques.

Fig. 2(c) shows low-temperature (120 K) solid electron spinresonance (ESR) spectra with the signals at g 2.075, attributed to electrons trapped on the surface defects 31.Notably, the ESR signal of Cu 2 S/CuS x is much stronger than that of bulky Cu 2 S, demonstrating the abundant defects on the former catalyst.Additionally, a pretreatment with CO 2 reduced the ESR signal on Cu 2 S/ CuS x sample, exhibiting a strong CO 2 adsorption that eliminates surface defects by interacting with CO 2 , which should benefit the CO 2 reduction in the photocatalysis.Photoluminescence (PL) spectra (Fig. 2d) were used to characterize the electron-hole separation on the samples, which show obvious PL emissions at 465 nm ascribed to the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs.The PL emission intensity of Cu 2 S/CuS x is much lower than that of bulky Cu 2 S, indicating that the Cu 2 S/CuS x could more effectively hinder the electron-hole recombination than bulky Cu 2 S. Fig. 2(e) shows transient photocurrent curve of the Cu 2 S/CuS x exhibiting much higher photocurrent than bulky Cu 2 S, which reveals the fast generation and transfer of abundant electron-hole pairs on the Cu 2 S/CuS x sample under irradiation, a feature that is favorable for photocatalysis 32.X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) indicate the presence of copper and sulfur on the two samples, where the Cu LMM AES signal at 916.8 eV and S2p signals at 162.5/163.3eV are assigned to the Cu and S 2A /S 2 2A , respectively (Figs.S1-S3) 33,34.These data are the typical characteristics of Cu 2 S materials.The relative positions of valence band maximum (VBM) of Cu 2 S/CuS x determined by valence-band X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (VB XPS) is 1.33 eV (Fig. 2f).Because of the band gap of Cu 2 S/CuS x is 2.07 eV, the conduction band minimum is inferred to be A0.74 eV, which meets the thermodynamic demands for CO 2 reduction to CO (A0.53 eV) 19. Fig. 3 shows electronic microscopy images that provide direct observation of the catalyst structures.The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images (Fig. 3a, b andS4) of the Cu 2 S/CuS x show irregular morphology.Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Fig. 3c andS5) show amorphous matrix of Cu 2 S/CuS x .EDS maps (Fig. 3d-g) display that Cu and S elements are uniformly distributed on the sample.Notably, the high-resolution TEM image (Fig. 3h) gives the Cu 2 S nanoparticles with typical lattice feature of Cu 2 S(110) distributing on the amorphous matrix.By counting more than 100 nanoparticles, the diameter distribution is localized in 1.2-4.0nm with an average size at 2.4 nm.The refined geometry of Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst was further characterized by the highresolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images (Fig. 3i, j and S6), where the Cu 2 S nanoparticles could be easily distinguished from each other by the different brightness contrast.The Cu 2 S nanoparticles show the crystallized lattice as confirmed by a fast Fourier transform (FFT) analysis and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns (Figs.S5h andS7).Notably, these nanoparticles have irregular border, which might be due to the strong interaction between Cu 2 S nanoparticles and the amorphous matrix.This feature should be reasonably attributed to the synthesis procedures, where the Cu 2 S nanoparticles were crystallized from the CuS x matrix.High-resolution STEM images of the amorphous region show atomic observation of isolated Cu sites, which randomly distribute on the CuS x matrix, in good agreement with the amorphous feature.These results confirm the proposed structure of the Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst with nanosized Cu 2 S particles on the amorphous CuS x matrix.Such structure should efficiently form Cu 2 S-CuS x heterojunctions and abundant defects.In contrast, the bulky Cu 2 S sample has highly crystallized nanoparticles with diameter at 30-100 nm (Figs.S8 and S9). The catalysis of various catalysts was evaluated in the CO 2 reduction under visible light irradiation (400-780 nm) at room temperature.The CO and H 2 generation rates of the Cu-based catalysts are shown in Fig. 4(a).The blank run without irradiation failed to convert CO 2 (Fig. S10).The referenced catalysts such as Cu, Cu 2 O, and CuO are poorly active, giving extremely low CO production in a reaction for 12 h (Figs.S11 andS12) 35,36.Interestingly, the Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst efficiently catalyzed the CO 2 reduction, giving average CO productivity at 4.0 mmol h A1 with undetectable other carbon-containing products.In this process, the hydrogen generation rate was 0.47 mmol h A1 , which is much lower than that of CO, suggesting most of the hydrogen species have been utilized for the CO 2 reduction rather than HER.In addition, gaseous oxygen with yield of 2.1 mmol h A1 was detected in the emission gas, showing the average generation rate ratio of O 2 / (CO H 2 ) close to 1:2, in good agreement with the photoreaction processes involving CO 2 reduction and water oxidation reactions 11,12,15,16,18,19.To further identify the origin of the CO product, we employed the isotopically labeled 13 CO 2 as feed, giving 13 CO as the product with undetectable unlabeled CO, confirming the CO is from the reduction of 13 CO 2 feedstock (Fig. 4b).In addi-tion, the generation of O 2 and H 2 is further confirmed by the MS signals.In contrast, the bulky Cu 2 S exhibited the average CO productivity at 0.35 mmol h A1 under equivalent reaction conditions, which is much lower than that of Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst.These data mean the high activity of Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst that even outperforms catalysts containing noble metals 22,23 and Bi-based catalysts at comparable reaction conditions 15,16,37, which have been reported to be highly efficient for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction (Table S1). Fig. 4(c) shows dependences of CO and hydrogen yields on time over different catalysts.The Cu 2 S/CuS x continuously produced CO with the irradiation time, giving average CO yield of 50.5 mmol in 12 h.The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) (Fig. S13) of Cu 2 S/ CuS x appeared at 0.11 in the CO 2 reduction with photoirradiation at 420 nm, while the bulky Cu 2 S exhibited much lower AQE at 0.01.The performance of Cu 2 S/CuS x was further evaluated in the CO 2 reduction under photoirradiation with varied wavelengths (Fig. 4d).The Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst gave average CO productivity at 4.7 mmol h A1 under the photoirradiation of k 380 nm.Under visible light irradiation (k 420 nm), the average CO productivity still appeared at 4.1 mmol h A1 .The Cu 2 S/CuS x was still active even under the photoirradiation at k 550 nm, showing the CO productivity at 1.3 mmol h A1 .These data indicate that the high activity of Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst in a wide range of irradiation wavelengths.Very importantly, the Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst is stable under the reaction conditions and easily reused, exhibiting almost unchanged performances in the recycle tests (Fig. 4e).For example, the CO productivity at 4.0 mmol h A1 was still obtained in the 6th run, which is similar to that of the as-synthesized catalyst.Further characterizations using XRD, XPS, UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectrum and TEM (Figs.S14-S17) indicate the almost unchanged structure of the fresh and used Cu 2 S/CuS x catalysts, demonstrating the catalyst stability. Considering that the Cu 2 S/CuS x and bulky Cu 2 S catalysts have similar compositions of Cu and S, the remarkably distinguishable catalytic performances should be reasonably assigned to the different structures.In addition to the charge separation, the interaction between catalyst surface and CO 2 is crucial for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction 4,8,15,16.Therefore, we performed the FT-IR spectra to probe the interaction between CO 2 and catalyst surface under dark conditions.As shown in Fig. 5(a), the Cu 2 S/CuS x gave a band at 618 cm A1 assigned to the Cu-S bond 38.When CO 2 was introduced to the catalyst, an additional signal appeared at 637 cm A1 assigning to the weak Cu-O bond 39, suggesting the bonding interaction between CO 2 and the Cu species.After sweeping the catalyst with flowing Ar, the adsorbed CO 2 could be removed as confirmed by the disappearance of Cu-O signal.Under the equivalent test, the Cu-O interaction was undetectable on the bulky Cu 2 S catalyst, suggesting the negligible interaction with CO 2 .The strong interaction of CO 2 on Cu 2 S/CuS x is also confirmed by the temperature-programmed CO 2 desorption measurements (Fig. S18), which should be reasonably attributed to the abundant defects on amorphous CuS x matrix that has been identified as sites for adsorbing CO 2 . Fig. 5(b) shows in-situ Raman spectra for studying the CO 2 adsorption on the catalyst surface.The as-synthesized Cu 2 S/CuS x shows the modes at 270 and 471 cm A1 assigned to Cu-S bond 40,41.These modes were blue shifted after CO 2 adsorption, which might be due to the formation of CuA A AOCO interaction.When the feed gas was switched to Ar to remove the CO 2 on the surface, the Raman modes were shifted back to the original wavenumbers, indicating the reversibility of Cu 2 S/CuS x surface.For the bulky Cu 2 S sample, the Raman modes were unchanged during the CO 2 treat-ments (Fig. S19), due to the lack of interaction between CO 2 and the catalyst surface, which is in good agreement with the results of FT-IR study.In-situ DRIFTS under photoirradiation was performed to gain more insight into the reaction process (room temperature, visible light).When a wet CO 2 feed gas was introduced into the Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst (Fig. 5c), new bands appeared at 1392, 1531 and 1688 cm A1 and then strengthened with the irradiation time.The peak at 1392 cm A1 indicates the formation of HCOO species, which is stable on the catalyst surface and difficult to be transformed 42.The peak at 1531 cm A1 was assigned to the COOH species, an important intermediate for the CO 2 -to-CO transformation 19,43.The peak at 1688 cm A1 was attributed to the asymmetric stretching of HCO 3 44.Further reaction with irradiation led to the generation of gaseous CO with bands at 2065 and 2077 cm A1 .Because of the instability of COOH and easy decomposition to form CO. Under the equivalent in-situ DRIFTS study, the bulky Cu 2 S sample (Fig. S20) exhibits the signals of COOH (1531 cm A1 ) and HCO 3 (1692 cm A1 ), confirming the similar reaction channels with that over Cu 2 S/CuS x .However, the concentration of these intermediates on bulky Cu 2 S are much lower than those on the Cu 2 S/CuS x sample, and the band of gaseous CO was almost undetectable even in a long reaction period, which might explain the different activities on the catalysts. Based on these data, it is clearly demonstrated that the CO 2 photoreduction proceeds the chemical adsorption of CO 2 , and the proton-electron pair transfer to give COOH intermediate.Further proton-coupled electron addition leads to the decomposition of COOH to form CO and water.The CO species easily desorb from the catalyst surface to gaseous CO (Fig. S21).Such reaction pathway is very similar to those previously identified in the photocatalytic systems using Cu-based catalysts 19,45, where the hydrogen intermediate stabilization and interaction with CO 2 are regarded crucial.Following these knowledges, we investigated the hydrogen species on the catalysts by 1 H MAS NMR (Fig. 5d, S22 and S23).The blank run with Cu 2 S/CuS x in H 2 O without photoirradiation has no signal, because light is necessary for water splitting (Fig. S22).When light irradiation was induced, resonance at 1.23 ppm assigned to SH species appeared to suggest the generation of abundant protons on the catalyst under photoirradiation, which is well known as a light reaction.Introducing CO 2 to the catalyst leads to reduction of the SH signal without photoirradiation, forming new resonances at 7.98 and 9.92 ppm assigning to the HCOO and COOH species, which suggests that the protons participate in the CO 2 reduction, which is well known as a dark reaction (Fig. 5d).These results might explain the high activity for CO 2 reduction and efficient hindrance of HER on the Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst.The H species should be stabilized on the amorphous CuS x matrix, because the crystallized Cu 2 S is active for the HER 46,47, exhibiting extremely weak SH signal in the NMR test (Fig. S23).The reaction with H 2 O and CO 2 under light irradiation also gives signals of HCOO and SH species, where the signal of HCOO is stronger than that of SH, and the COOH species is almost undetectable.These phenomena are due to the transformation of COOH to gaseous CO, and the formed HCOO still exists in the reaction system because of its stability and difficulty in further transformation 48.In the dark reaction with feeding H 2 O/CO 2 , the HCOO and COOH species are almost undetectable on the bulky Cu 2 S (Fig. S23), which might be due to the weak ability to adsorb and reduce CO 2 . Further insight into the crucial role of hydrogen species in CO 2 reduction was performed by kinetic isotopic effects (KIE) study using D-labelled water (D 2 O).On the Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst, the CO production rate was decreased with D 2 O compared with that using H 2 O, giving the KIE at 1.33 (Fig. S24).This phenomenon suggests that the hydrogen intermediates control the reaction rate on the Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst, because the larger D diffuses more slowly and is less active than H.In contrast, the CO formation rate was very similar using H 2 O and D 2 O over bulky Cu 2 S catalyst, giving the KIE at 1.06, which might be explained by the weak CO 2 adsorption/activation, making it as the rate-control step that is different from that on the Cu 2 S/CuS x . Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to study the CO 2 reduction with active hydrogen species on the Cu 2 S (110) surface, S vacancies were artificially controlled to simulate the surface of highly crystallized Cu 2 S (intact Cu 2 S) and amorphous CuS x matrix with abundant defects (defect-rich Cu 2 S) (Fig. 5e, f andS25).The defect-rich surface gives the adsorption energy (E ads ) to split H species at 0.30 eV on the S site (Fig. S26), such appropriate adsorption strength should benefit the H migration on the surface of amorphous CuS x (Fig. S27).In addition, the electrons are favorably trapped at the defect sites located slightly below the conduction band edge 49.These features benefit the efficient hydrogen transfer to adsorbed CO 2 species at the defect-rich matrix.In contrast, the intact Cu 2 S surface shows much higher E ads at 1.75 eV for H adsorption on the S site (Fig. S28), such strong adsorption is unfavorable for the subsequent reaction with CO 2 species.The different H diffusion ability on the highly crystallized and defect-rich Cu 2 S surface was also confirmed experimentally by the hydrogen spillover test, which is known as proton-electron pair transfer on the reducible surface 49.By loading Pt on the Cu-based catalysts and using WO 3 to detect the spilled H species, and gaseous hydrogen was introduced to the sample, the WO 3 -mixed Pt/Cu 2 S/CuS x sample turned to dark color more rapidly than that on Pt/bulky Cu 2 S (Fig. S29).This phenomenon indicates the facile proton-electron transfer on the Cu 2 S/CuS x . The Gibbs free energy (G) profiles of the CO 2 to CO with H atom on the catalysts are provided in Fig. 5(g).The reaction starts from CO 2 adsorption, giving Gibbs free energy at A0.02 eV and 0.05 eV for the defect-rich Cu 2 S and intact Cu 2 S surface, respectively.Notably, the co-adsorption of CO 2 and H is much more feasible on the defect-rich Cu 2 S (G A1.81eV), which is well consistent with the experimental results.The diffusion of H atoms to CO 2 , leading to the consequent generation of COOH (0.20 eV) and CO (A1.25 eV) intermediates.Such feature leads to efficient CO formation on the defect-rich surface (Figs.S30-S32, Table S2).In contrast, the transformation of CO 2 to CO on the bulky Cu 2 S catalyst, need to overcome higher energy barriers for the coadsorption of CO 2 and H (G 1.43 eV), resulting into poor CO yield in the experimental tests."}], "light source": [{"llm generation": "visible light", "source": "CuS -mediated two reaction systems enable biomimetic photocatalysis in CO2 reduction with visible light", "context": "CuS -mediated two reaction systems enable biomimetic photocatalysis in CO2 reduction with visible light"}, {"llm generation": "visible light", "source": "In the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction under visible light irradiation, the Cu 2 S/CuS x exhibited a CO production rate at 4.0 mmol h A1 that is 12-fold higher than that of the general Cu 2 S catalyst.", "context": "The performances of heterogeneous catalysts can be effectively improved by optimizing the catalysts via appropriate structure design.Herein, we show that the catalysis of cuprous sulfide can be boosted by constructing the hybrid structure with Cu 2 S nanoparticles on amorphous CuS x matrix (Cu 2 S/CuS x ).In the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction under visible light irradiation, the Cu 2 S/CuS x exhibited a CO production rate at 4.0 mmol h A1 that is 12-fold higher than that of the general Cu 2 S catalyst.Further characterizations reveal that the Cu 2 S/CuS x has two reaction systems that realize the biomimetic catalysis, involving in the light reaction on the Cu 2 S nanoparticle-CuS x matrix heterojunctions for proton/electron production, and the dark reaction on the defect-rich CuS x for CO 2 reduction.The CuS x matrix could efficiently activate CO 2 and stabilize the split hydrogen species to hinder undesired hydrogen evolution reaction, which benefits the proton-electron transfer to reduce CO 2 , a key step for bridging the two reaction systems."}, {"llm generation": "UV-Vis", "source": "A 300 W Xe lamp (Beijing China Education Au-light Co., Ltd, CEL-HXF300) was employed as light source, with an output light density to the catalyst location in the reactor at 0.112 W cm A2 measured by a spectroradiometer, and the wavelengths were controlled by different filters.", "context": "Copper acetylacetonate (0.3 mmol), CS(NH 2 ) 2 (0.6 mmol), HMT (1.5 mmol) and NH 4 F (1.5 mmol) were dissolved in 15 mL ethylene glycol at room temperature.Then the mixture was transferred to a 20-mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and heated at 100 C for 12 h.The solid product was collected by centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 2 min, followed by washing with ethanol and cyclohexane for five times for completely moving the organic residuals.After drying at 80 C for 4 h, the Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst was finally obtained.

The catalysis of various catalysts was evaluated in the CO 2 reduction under visible light irradiation (400-780 nm) at room temperature.The CO and H 2 generation rates of the Cu-based catalysts are shown in Fig. 4(a).The blank run without irradiation failed to convert CO 2 (Fig. S10).The referenced catalysts such as Cu, Cu 2 O, and CuO are poorly active, giving extremely low CO production in a reaction for 12 h (Figs.S11 andS12) 35,36.Interestingly, the Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst efficiently catalyzed the CO 2 reduction, giving average CO productivity at 4.0 mmol h A1 with undetectable other carbon-containing products.In this process, the hydrogen generation rate was 0.47 mmol h A1 , which is much lower than that of CO, suggesting most of the hydrogen species have been utilized for the CO 2 reduction rather than HER.In addition, gaseous oxygen with yield of 2.1 mmol h A1 was detected in the emission gas, showing the average generation rate ratio of O 2 / (CO H 2 ) close to 1:2, in good agreement with the photoreaction processes involving CO 2 reduction and water oxidation reactions 11,12,15,16,18,19.To further identify the origin of the CO product, we employed the isotopically labeled 13 CO 2 as feed, giving 13 CO as the product with undetectable unlabeled CO, confirming the CO is from the reduction of 13 CO 2 feedstock (Fig. 4b).In addi-tion, the generation of O 2 and H 2 is further confirmed by the MS signals.In contrast, the bulky Cu 2 S exhibited the average CO productivity at 0.35 mmol h A1 under equivalent reaction conditions, which is much lower than that of Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst.These data mean the high activity of Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst that even outperforms catalysts containing noble metals 22,23 and Bi-based catalysts at comparable reaction conditions 15,16,37, which have been reported to be highly efficient for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction (Table S1). Fig. 4(c) shows dependences of CO and hydrogen yields on time over different catalysts.The Cu 2 S/CuS x continuously produced CO with the irradiation time, giving average CO yield of 50.5 mmol in 12 h.The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) (Fig. S13) of Cu 2 S/ CuS x appeared at 0.11 in the CO 2 reduction with photoirradiation at 420 nm, while the bulky Cu 2 S exhibited much lower AQE at 0.01.The performance of Cu 2 S/CuS x was further evaluated in the CO 2 reduction under photoirradiation with varied wavelengths (Fig. 4d).The Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst gave average CO productivity at 4.7 mmol h A1 under the photoirradiation of k 380 nm.Under visible light irradiation (k 420 nm), the average CO productivity still appeared at 4.1 mmol h A1 .The Cu 2 S/CuS x was still active even under the photoirradiation at k 550 nm, showing the CO productivity at 1.3 mmol h A1 .These data indicate that the high activity of Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst in a wide range of irradiation wavelengths.Very importantly, the Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst is stable under the reaction conditions and easily reused, exhibiting almost unchanged performances in the recycle tests (Fig. 4e).For example, the CO productivity at 4.0 mmol h A1 was still obtained in the 6th run, which is similar to that of the as-synthesized catalyst.Further characterizations using XRD, XPS, UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectrum and TEM (Figs.S14-S17) indicate the almost unchanged structure of the fresh and used Cu 2 S/CuS x catalysts, demonstrating the catalyst stability. Considering that the Cu 2 S/CuS x and bulky Cu 2 S catalysts have similar compositions of Cu and S, the remarkably distinguishable catalytic performances should be reasonably assigned to the different structures.In addition to the charge separation, the interaction between catalyst surface and CO 2 is crucial for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction 4,8,15,16.Therefore, we performed the FT-IR spectra to probe the interaction between CO 2 and catalyst surface under dark conditions.As shown in Fig. 5(a), the Cu 2 S/CuS x gave a band at 618 cm A1 assigned to the Cu-S bond 38.When CO 2 was introduced to the catalyst, an additional signal appeared at 637 cm A1 assigning to the weak Cu-O bond 39, suggesting the bonding interaction between CO 2 and the Cu species.After sweeping the catalyst with flowing Ar, the adsorbed CO 2 could be removed as confirmed by the disappearance of Cu-O signal.Under the equivalent test, the Cu-O interaction was undetectable on the bulky Cu 2 S catalyst, suggesting the negligible interaction with CO 2 .The strong interaction of CO 2 on Cu 2 S/CuS x is also confirmed by the temperature-programmed CO 2 desorption measurements (Fig. S18), which should be reasonably attributed to the abundant defects on amorphous CuS x matrix that has been identified as sites for adsorbing CO 2 . Fig. 5(b) shows in-situ Raman spectra for studying the CO 2 adsorption on the catalyst surface.The as-synthesized Cu 2 S/CuS x shows the modes at 270 and 471 cm A1 assigned to Cu-S bond 40,41.These modes were blue shifted after CO 2 adsorption, which might be due to the formation of CuA A AOCO interaction.When the feed gas was switched to Ar to remove the CO 2 on the surface, the Raman modes were shifted back to the original wavenumbers, indicating the reversibility of Cu 2 S/CuS x surface.For the bulky Cu 2 S sample, the Raman modes were unchanged during the CO 2 treat-ments (Fig. S19), due to the lack of interaction between CO 2 and the catalyst surface, which is in good agreement with the results of FT-IR study.In-situ DRIFTS under photoirradiation was performed to gain more insight into the reaction process (room temperature, visible light).When a wet CO 2 feed gas was introduced into the Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst (Fig. 5c), new bands appeared at 1392, 1531 and 1688 cm A1 and then strengthened with the irradiation time.The peak at 1392 cm A1 indicates the formation of HCOO species, which is stable on the catalyst surface and difficult to be transformed 42.The peak at 1531 cm A1 was assigned to the COOH species, an important intermediate for the CO 2 -to-CO transformation 19,43.The peak at 1688 cm A1 was attributed to the asymmetric stretching of HCO 3 44.Further reaction with irradiation led to the generation of gaseous CO with bands at 2065 and 2077 cm A1 .Because of the instability of COOH and easy decomposition to form CO. Under the equivalent in-situ DRIFTS study, the bulky Cu 2 S sample (Fig. S20) exhibits the signals of COOH (1531 cm A1 ) and HCO 3 (1692 cm A1 ), confirming the similar reaction channels with that over Cu 2 S/CuS x .However, the concentration of these intermediates on bulky Cu 2 S are much lower than those on the Cu 2 S/CuS x sample, and the band of gaseous CO was almost undetectable even in a long reaction period, which might explain the different activities on the catalysts. Based on these data, it is clearly demonstrated that the CO 2 photoreduction proceeds the chemical adsorption of CO 2 , and the proton-electron pair transfer to give COOH intermediate.Further proton-coupled electron addition leads to the decomposition of COOH to form CO and water.The CO species easily desorb from the catalyst surface to gaseous CO (Fig. S21).Such reaction pathway is very similar to those previously identified in the photocatalytic systems using Cu-based catalysts 19,45, where the hydrogen intermediate stabilization and interaction with CO 2 are regarded crucial.Following these knowledges, we investigated the hydrogen species on the catalysts by 1 H MAS NMR (Fig. 5d, S22 and S23).The blank run with Cu 2 S/CuS x in H 2 O without photoirradiation has no signal, because light is necessary for water splitting (Fig. S22).When light irradiation was induced, resonance at 1.23 ppm assigned to SH species appeared to suggest the generation of abundant protons on the catalyst under photoirradiation, which is well known as a light reaction.Introducing CO 2 to the catalyst leads to reduction of the SH signal without photoirradiation, forming new resonances at 7.98 and 9.92 ppm assigning to the HCOO and COOH species, which suggests that the protons participate in the CO 2 reduction, which is well known as a dark reaction (Fig. 5d).These results might explain the high activity for CO 2 reduction and efficient hindrance of HER on the Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst.The H species should be stabilized on the amorphous CuS x matrix, because the crystallized Cu 2 S is active for the HER 46,47, exhibiting extremely weak SH signal in the NMR test (Fig. S23).The reaction with H 2 O and CO 2 under light irradiation also gives signals of HCOO and SH species, where the signal of HCOO is stronger than that of SH, and the COOH species is almost undetectable.These phenomena are due to the transformation of COOH to gaseous CO, and the formed HCOO still exists in the reaction system because of its stability and difficulty in further transformation 48.In the dark reaction with feeding H 2 O/CO 2 , the HCOO and COOH species are almost undetectable on the bulky Cu 2 S (Fig. S23), which might be due to the weak ability to adsorb and reduce CO 2 . Further insight into the crucial role of hydrogen species in CO 2 reduction was performed by kinetic isotopic effects (KIE) study using D-labelled water (D 2 O).On the Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst, the CO production rate was decreased with D 2 O compared with that using H 2 O, giving the KIE at 1.33 (Fig. S24).This phenomenon suggests that the hydrogen intermediates control the reaction rate on the Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst, because the larger D diffuses more slowly and is less active than H.In contrast, the CO formation rate was very similar using H 2 O and D 2 O over bulky Cu 2 S catalyst, giving the KIE at 1.06, which might be explained by the weak CO 2 adsorption/activation, making it as the rate-control step that is different from that on the Cu 2 S/CuS x . Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to study the CO 2 reduction with active hydrogen species on the Cu 2 S (110) surface, S vacancies were artificially controlled to simulate the surface of highly crystallized Cu 2 S (intact Cu 2 S) and amorphous CuS x matrix with abundant defects (defect-rich Cu 2 S) (Fig. 5e, f andS25).The defect-rich surface gives the adsorption energy (E ads ) to split H species at 0.30 eV on the S site (Fig. S26), such appropriate adsorption strength should benefit the H migration on the surface of amorphous CuS x (Fig. S27).In addition, the electrons are favorably trapped at the defect sites located slightly below the conduction band edge 49.These features benefit the efficient hydrogen transfer to adsorbed CO 2 species at the defect-rich matrix.In contrast, the intact Cu 2 S surface shows much higher E ads at 1.75 eV for H adsorption on the S site (Fig. S28), such strong adsorption is unfavorable for the subsequent reaction with CO 2 species.The different H diffusion ability on the highly crystallized and defect-rich Cu 2 S surface was also confirmed experimentally by the hydrogen spillover test, which is known as proton-electron pair transfer on the reducible surface 49.By loading Pt on the Cu-based catalysts and using WO 3 to detect the spilled H species, and gaseous hydrogen was introduced to the sample, the WO 3 -mixed Pt/Cu 2 S/CuS x sample turned to dark color more rapidly than that on Pt/bulky Cu 2 S (Fig. S29).This phenomenon indicates the facile proton-electron transfer on the Cu 2 S/CuS x . The Gibbs free energy (G) profiles of the CO 2 to CO with H atom on the catalysts are provided in Fig. 5(g).The reaction starts from CO 2 adsorption, giving Gibbs free energy at A0.02 eV and 0.05 eV for the defect-rich Cu 2 S and intact Cu 2 S surface, respectively.Notably, the co-adsorption of CO 2 and H is much more feasible on the defect-rich Cu 2 S (G A1.81eV), which is well consistent with the experimental results.The diffusion of H atoms to CO 2 , leading to the consequent generation of COOH (0.20 eV) and CO (A1.25 eV) intermediates.Such feature leads to efficient CO formation on the defect-rich surface (Figs.S30-S32, Table S2).In contrast, the transformation of CO 2 to CO on the bulky Cu 2 S catalyst, need to overcome higher energy barriers for the coadsorption of CO 2 and H (G 1.43 eV), resulting into poor CO yield in the experimental tests."}, {"llm generation": "Monochromatic", "source": "The Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst gave average CO productivity at 4.7 mmol h A1 under the photoirradiation of k 380 nm.", "context": "The catalysts were synthesized by a facile and scalable method, that is the solvothermal treatment of copper acetylacetonate with CS(NH 2 ) 2 , hexamethylenetetramine (HMT), and NH 4 F in ethylene glycol, as shown in Fig. 1.The solvothermal treatment at moderate temperature delayed the nucleation (100 C for 12 h), forming an amorphous CuS x matrix containing partially crystallized Cu 2 S nanoparticles, denoted as Cu 2 S/CuS x .For comparison, the general Cu 2 S crystals (denoted as bulky Cu 2 S) were obtained by similar procedures at 200 C for 24 h for adequate crystallization. The obtained samples were characterized by a set of physical techniques.Fig. 2(a) gives XRD patterns of Cu 2 S/CuS x and bulky Cu 2 S samples, showing peaks assigned to the typical Cu 2 S structure.The Cu 2 S/CuS x exhibits much weaker intensity and larger full width at half maxima (FWHM) because of the low crystallinity that might mean the formation of abundant defects.Ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) diffuse reflectance spectra (Fig. 2b) were conducted to study the electronic band structure, and both samples have intense absorption ranging from ultraviolet to visible region with energy band gaps at 2.07 eV for Cu 2 S/CuS x and 2.18 eV for bulky Cu 2 S. Fig. 2(c) shows low-temperature (120 K) solid electron spinresonance (ESR) spectra with the signals at g 2.075, attributed to electrons trapped on the surface defects 31.Notably, the ESR signal of Cu 2 S/CuS x is much stronger than that of bulky Cu 2 S, demonstrating the abundant defects on the former catalyst.Additionally, a pretreatment with CO 2 reduced the ESR signal on Cu 2 S/ CuS x sample, exhibiting a strong CO 2 adsorption that eliminates surface defects by interacting with CO 2 , which should benefit the CO 2 reduction in the photocatalysis.Photoluminescence (PL) spectra (Fig. 2d) were used to characterize the electron-hole separation on the samples, which show obvious PL emissions at 465 nm ascribed to the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs.The PL emission intensity of Cu 2 S/CuS x is much lower than that of bulky Cu 2 S, indicating that the Cu 2 S/CuS x could more effectively hinder the electron-hole recombination than bulky Cu 2 S. Fig. 2(e) shows transient photocurrent curve of the Cu 2 S/CuS x exhibiting much higher photocurrent than bulky Cu 2 S, which reveals the fast generation and transfer of abundant electron-hole pairs on the Cu 2 S/CuS x sample under irradiation, a feature that is favorable for photocatalysis 32.X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) indicate the presence of copper and sulfur on the two samples, where the Cu LMM AES signal at 916.8 eV and S2p signals at 162.5/163.3eV are assigned to the Cu and S 2A /S 2 2A , respectively (Figs.S1-S3) 33,34.These data are the typical characteristics of Cu 2 S materials.The relative positions of valence band maximum (VBM) of Cu 2 S/CuS x determined by valence-band X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (VB XPS) is 1.33 eV (Fig. 2f).Because of the band gap of Cu 2 S/CuS x is 2.07 eV, the conduction band minimum is inferred to be A0.74 eV, which meets the thermodynamic demands for CO 2 reduction to CO (A0.53 eV) 19. Fig. 3 shows electronic microscopy images that provide direct observation of the catalyst structures.The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images (Fig. 3a, b andS4) of the Cu 2 S/CuS x show irregular morphology.Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Fig. 3c andS5) show amorphous matrix of Cu 2 S/CuS x .EDS maps (Fig. 3d-g) display that Cu and S elements are uniformly distributed on the sample.Notably, the high-resolution TEM image (Fig. 3h) gives the Cu 2 S nanoparticles with typical lattice feature of Cu 2 S(110) distributing on the amorphous matrix.By counting more than 100 nanoparticles, the diameter distribution is localized in 1.2-4.0nm with an average size at 2.4 nm.The refined geometry of Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst was further characterized by the highresolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images (Fig. 3i, j and S6), where the Cu 2 S nanoparticles could be easily distinguished from each other by the different brightness contrast.The Cu 2 S nanoparticles show the crystallized lattice as confirmed by a fast Fourier transform (FFT) analysis and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns (Figs.S5h andS7).Notably, these nanoparticles have irregular border, which might be due to the strong interaction between Cu 2 S nanoparticles and the amorphous matrix.This feature should be reasonably attributed to the synthesis procedures, where the Cu 2 S nanoparticles were crystallized from the CuS x matrix.High-resolution STEM images of the amorphous region show atomic observation of isolated Cu sites, which randomly distribute on the CuS x matrix, in good agreement with the amorphous feature.These results confirm the proposed structure of the Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst with nanosized Cu 2 S particles on the amorphous CuS x matrix.Such structure should efficiently form Cu 2 S-CuS x heterojunctions and abundant defects.In contrast, the bulky Cu 2 S sample has highly crystallized nanoparticles with diameter at 30-100 nm (Figs.S8 and S9). The catalysis of various catalysts was evaluated in the CO 2 reduction under visible light irradiation (400-780 nm) at room temperature.The CO and H 2 generation rates of the Cu-based catalysts are shown in Fig. 4(a).The blank run without irradiation failed to convert CO 2 (Fig. S10).The referenced catalysts such as Cu, Cu 2 O, and CuO are poorly active, giving extremely low CO production in a reaction for 12 h (Figs.S11 andS12) 35,36.Interestingly, the Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst efficiently catalyzed the CO 2 reduction, giving average CO productivity at 4.0 mmol h A1 with undetectable other carbon-containing products.In this process, the hydrogen generation rate was 0.47 mmol h A1 , which is much lower than that of CO, suggesting most of the hydrogen species have been utilized for the CO 2 reduction rather than HER.In addition, gaseous oxygen with yield of 2.1 mmol h A1 was detected in the emission gas, showing the average generation rate ratio of O 2 / (CO H 2 ) close to 1:2, in good agreement with the photoreaction processes involving CO 2 reduction and water oxidation reactions 11,12,15,16,18,19.To further identify the origin of the CO product, we employed the isotopically labeled 13 CO 2 as feed, giving 13 CO as the product with undetectable unlabeled CO, confirming the CO is from the reduction of 13 CO 2 feedstock (Fig. 4b).In addi-tion, the generation of O 2 and H 2 is further confirmed by the MS signals.In contrast, the bulky Cu 2 S exhibited the average CO productivity at 0.35 mmol h A1 under equivalent reaction conditions, which is much lower than that of Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst.These data mean the high activity of Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst that even outperforms catalysts containing noble metals 22,23 and Bi-based catalysts at comparable reaction conditions 15,16,37, which have been reported to be highly efficient for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction (Table S1). Fig. 4(c) shows dependences of CO and hydrogen yields on time over different catalysts.The Cu 2 S/CuS x continuously produced CO with the irradiation time, giving average CO yield of 50.5 mmol in 12 h.The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) (Fig. S13) of Cu 2 S/ CuS x appeared at 0.11 in the CO 2 reduction with photoirradiation at 420 nm, while the bulky Cu 2 S exhibited much lower AQE at 0.01.The performance of Cu 2 S/CuS x was further evaluated in the CO 2 reduction under photoirradiation with varied wavelengths (Fig. 4d).The Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst gave average CO productivity at 4.7 mmol h A1 under the photoirradiation of k 380 nm.Under visible light irradiation (k 420 nm), the average CO productivity still appeared at 4.1 mmol h A1 .The Cu 2 S/CuS x was still active even under the photoirradiation at k 550 nm, showing the CO productivity at 1.3 mmol h A1 .These data indicate that the high activity of Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst in a wide range of irradiation wavelengths.Very importantly, the Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst is stable under the reaction conditions and easily reused, exhibiting almost unchanged performances in the recycle tests (Fig. 4e).For example, the CO productivity at 4.0 mmol h A1 was still obtained in the 6th run, which is similar to that of the as-synthesized catalyst.Further characterizations using XRD, XPS, UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectrum and TEM (Figs.S14-S17) indicate the almost unchanged structure of the fresh and used Cu 2 S/CuS x catalysts, demonstrating the catalyst stability. Considering that the Cu 2 S/CuS x and bulky Cu 2 S catalysts have similar compositions of Cu and S, the remarkably distinguishable catalytic performances should be reasonably assigned to the different structures.In addition to the charge separation, the interaction between catalyst surface and CO 2 is crucial for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction 4,8,15,16.Therefore, we performed the FT-IR spectra to probe the interaction between CO 2 and catalyst surface under dark conditions.As shown in Fig. 5(a), the Cu 2 S/CuS x gave a band at 618 cm A1 assigned to the Cu-S bond 38.When CO 2 was introduced to the catalyst, an additional signal appeared at 637 cm A1 assigning to the weak Cu-O bond 39, suggesting the bonding interaction between CO 2 and the Cu species.After sweeping the catalyst with flowing Ar, the adsorbed CO 2 could be removed as confirmed by the disappearance of Cu-O signal.Under the equivalent test, the Cu-O interaction was undetectable on the bulky Cu 2 S catalyst, suggesting the negligible interaction with CO 2 .The strong interaction of CO 2 on Cu 2 S/CuS x is also confirmed by the temperature-programmed CO 2 desorption measurements (Fig. S18), which should be reasonably attributed to the abundant defects on amorphous CuS x matrix that has been identified as sites for adsorbing CO 2 . Fig. 5(b) shows in-situ Raman spectra for studying the CO 2 adsorption on the catalyst surface.The as-synthesized Cu 2 S/CuS x shows the modes at 270 and 471 cm A1 assigned to Cu-S bond 40,41.These modes were blue shifted after CO 2 adsorption, which might be due to the formation of CuA A AOCO interaction.When the feed gas was switched to Ar to remove the CO 2 on the surface, the Raman modes were shifted back to the original wavenumbers, indicating the reversibility of Cu 2 S/CuS x surface.For the bulky Cu 2 S sample, the Raman modes were unchanged during the CO 2 treat-ments (Fig. S19), due to the lack of interaction between CO 2 and the catalyst surface, which is in good agreement with the results of FT-IR study.In-situ DRIFTS under photoirradiation was performed to gain more insight into the reaction process (room temperature, visible light).When a wet CO 2 feed gas was introduced into the Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst (Fig. 5c), new bands appeared at 1392, 1531 and 1688 cm A1 and then strengthened with the irradiation time.The peak at 1392 cm A1 indicates the formation of HCOO species, which is stable on the catalyst surface and difficult to be transformed 42.The peak at 1531 cm A1 was assigned to the COOH species, an important intermediate for the CO 2 -to-CO transformation 19,43.The peak at 1688 cm A1 was attributed to the asymmetric stretching of HCO 3 44.Further reaction with irradiation led to the generation of gaseous CO with bands at 2065 and 2077 cm A1 .Because of the instability of COOH and easy decomposition to form CO. Under the equivalent in-situ DRIFTS study, the bulky Cu 2 S sample (Fig. S20) exhibits the signals of COOH (1531 cm A1 ) and HCO 3 (1692 cm A1 ), confirming the similar reaction channels with that over Cu 2 S/CuS x .However, the concentration of these intermediates on bulky Cu 2 S are much lower than those on the Cu 2 S/CuS x sample, and the band of gaseous CO was almost undetectable even in a long reaction period, which might explain the different activities on the catalysts. Based on these data, it is clearly demonstrated that the CO 2 photoreduction proceeds the chemical adsorption of CO 2 , and the proton-electron pair transfer to give COOH intermediate.Further proton-coupled electron addition leads to the decomposition of COOH to form CO and water.The CO species easily desorb from the catalyst surface to gaseous CO (Fig. S21).Such reaction pathway is very similar to those previously identified in the photocatalytic systems using Cu-based catalysts 19,45, where the hydrogen intermediate stabilization and interaction with CO 2 are regarded crucial.Following these knowledges, we investigated the hydrogen species on the catalysts by 1 H MAS NMR (Fig. 5d, S22 and S23).The blank run with Cu 2 S/CuS x in H 2 O without photoirradiation has no signal, because light is necessary for water splitting (Fig. S22).When light irradiation was induced, resonance at 1.23 ppm assigned to SH species appeared to suggest the generation of abundant protons on the catalyst under photoirradiation, which is well known as a light reaction.Introducing CO 2 to the catalyst leads to reduction of the SH signal without photoirradiation, forming new resonances at 7.98 and 9.92 ppm assigning to the HCOO and COOH species, which suggests that the protons participate in the CO 2 reduction, which is well known as a dark reaction (Fig. 5d).These results might explain the high activity for CO 2 reduction and efficient hindrance of HER on the Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst.The H species should be stabilized on the amorphous CuS x matrix, because the crystallized Cu 2 S is active for the HER 46,47, exhibiting extremely weak SH signal in the NMR test (Fig. S23).The reaction with H 2 O and CO 2 under light irradiation also gives signals of HCOO and SH species, where the signal of HCOO is stronger than that of SH, and the COOH species is almost undetectable.These phenomena are due to the transformation of COOH to gaseous CO, and the formed HCOO still exists in the reaction system because of its stability and difficulty in further transformation 48.In the dark reaction with feeding H 2 O/CO 2 , the HCOO and COOH species are almost undetectable on the bulky Cu 2 S (Fig. S23), which might be due to the weak ability to adsorb and reduce CO 2 . Further insight into the crucial role of hydrogen species in CO 2 reduction was performed by kinetic isotopic effects (KIE) study using D-labelled water (D 2 O).On the Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst, the CO production rate was decreased with D 2 O compared with that using H 2 O, giving the KIE at 1.33 (Fig. S24).This phenomenon suggests that the hydrogen intermediates control the reaction rate on the Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst, because the larger D diffuses more slowly and is less active than H.In contrast, the CO formation rate was very similar using H 2 O and D 2 O over bulky Cu 2 S catalyst, giving the KIE at 1.06, which might be explained by the weak CO 2 adsorption/activation, making it as the rate-control step that is different from that on the Cu 2 S/CuS x . Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to study the CO 2 reduction with active hydrogen species on the Cu 2 S (110) surface, S vacancies were artificially controlled to simulate the surface of highly crystallized Cu 2 S (intact Cu 2 S) and amorphous CuS x matrix with abundant defects (defect-rich Cu 2 S) (Fig. 5e, f andS25).The defect-rich surface gives the adsorption energy (E ads ) to split H species at 0.30 eV on the S site (Fig. S26), such appropriate adsorption strength should benefit the H migration on the surface of amorphous CuS x (Fig. S27).In addition, the electrons are favorably trapped at the defect sites located slightly below the conduction band edge 49.These features benefit the efficient hydrogen transfer to adsorbed CO 2 species at the defect-rich matrix.In contrast, the intact Cu 2 S surface shows much higher E ads at 1.75 eV for H adsorption on the S site (Fig. S28), such strong adsorption is unfavorable for the subsequent reaction with CO 2 species.The different H diffusion ability on the highly crystallized and defect-rich Cu 2 S surface was also confirmed experimentally by the hydrogen spillover test, which is known as proton-electron pair transfer on the reducible surface 49.By loading Pt on the Cu-based catalysts and using WO 3 to detect the spilled H species, and gaseous hydrogen was introduced to the sample, the WO 3 -mixed Pt/Cu 2 S/CuS x sample turned to dark color more rapidly than that on Pt/bulky Cu 2 S (Fig. S29).This phenomenon indicates the facile proton-electron transfer on the Cu 2 S/CuS x . The Gibbs free energy (G) profiles of the CO 2 to CO with H atom on the catalysts are provided in Fig. 5(g).The reaction starts from CO 2 adsorption, giving Gibbs free energy at A0.02 eV and 0.05 eV for the defect-rich Cu 2 S and intact Cu 2 S surface, respectively.Notably, the co-adsorption of CO 2 and H is much more feasible on the defect-rich Cu 2 S (G A1.81eV), which is well consistent with the experimental results.The diffusion of H atoms to CO 2 , leading to the consequent generation of COOH (0.20 eV) and CO (A1.25 eV) intermediates.Such feature leads to efficient CO formation on the defect-rich surface (Figs.S30-S32, Table S2).In contrast, the transformation of CO 2 to CO on the bulky Cu 2 S catalyst, need to overcome higher energy barriers for the coadsorption of CO 2 and H (G 1.43 eV), resulting into poor CO yield in the experimental tests."}, {"llm generation": "Monochromatic", "source": "Under visible light irradiation (k 420 nm), the average CO productivity still appeared at 4.1 mmol h A1 .", "context": "The catalysts were synthesized by a facile and scalable method, that is the solvothermal treatment of copper acetylacetonate with CS(NH 2 ) 2 , hexamethylenetetramine (HMT), and NH 4 F in ethylene glycol, as shown in Fig. 1.The solvothermal treatment at moderate temperature delayed the nucleation (100 C for 12 h), forming an amorphous CuS x matrix containing partially crystallized Cu 2 S nanoparticles, denoted as Cu 2 S/CuS x .For comparison, the general Cu 2 S crystals (denoted as bulky Cu 2 S) were obtained by similar procedures at 200 C for 24 h for adequate crystallization. The obtained samples were characterized by a set of physical techniques.Fig. 2(a) gives XRD patterns of Cu 2 S/CuS x and bulky Cu 2 S samples, showing peaks assigned to the typical Cu 2 S structure.The Cu 2 S/CuS x exhibits much weaker intensity and larger full width at half maxima (FWHM) because of the low crystallinity that might mean the formation of abundant defects.Ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) diffuse reflectance spectra (Fig. 2b) were conducted to study the electronic band structure, and both samples have intense absorption ranging from ultraviolet to visible region with energy band gaps at 2.07 eV for Cu 2 S/CuS x and 2.18 eV for bulky Cu 2 S. Fig. 2(c) shows low-temperature (120 K) solid electron spinresonance (ESR) spectra with the signals at g 2.075, attributed to electrons trapped on the surface defects 31.Notably, the ESR signal of Cu 2 S/CuS x is much stronger than that of bulky Cu 2 S, demonstrating the abundant defects on the former catalyst.Additionally, a pretreatment with CO 2 reduced the ESR signal on Cu 2 S/ CuS x sample, exhibiting a strong CO 2 adsorption that eliminates surface defects by interacting with CO 2 , which should benefit the CO 2 reduction in the photocatalysis.Photoluminescence (PL) spectra (Fig. 2d) were used to characterize the electron-hole separation on the samples, which show obvious PL emissions at 465 nm ascribed to the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs.The PL emission intensity of Cu 2 S/CuS x is much lower than that of bulky Cu 2 S, indicating that the Cu 2 S/CuS x could more effectively hinder the electron-hole recombination than bulky Cu 2 S. Fig. 2(e) shows transient photocurrent curve of the Cu 2 S/CuS x exhibiting much higher photocurrent than bulky Cu 2 S, which reveals the fast generation and transfer of abundant electron-hole pairs on the Cu 2 S/CuS x sample under irradiation, a feature that is favorable for photocatalysis 32.X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) indicate the presence of copper and sulfur on the two samples, where the Cu LMM AES signal at 916.8 eV and S2p signals at 162.5/163.3eV are assigned to the Cu and S 2A /S 2 2A , respectively (Figs.S1-S3) 33,34.These data are the typical characteristics of Cu 2 S materials.The relative positions of valence band maximum (VBM) of Cu 2 S/CuS x determined by valence-band X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (VB XPS) is 1.33 eV (Fig. 2f).Because of the band gap of Cu 2 S/CuS x is 2.07 eV, the conduction band minimum is inferred to be A0.74 eV, which meets the thermodynamic demands for CO 2 reduction to CO (A0.53 eV) 19. Fig. 3 shows electronic microscopy images that provide direct observation of the catalyst structures.The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images (Fig. 3a, b andS4) of the Cu 2 S/CuS x show irregular morphology.Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Fig. 3c andS5) show amorphous matrix of Cu 2 S/CuS x .EDS maps (Fig. 3d-g) display that Cu and S elements are uniformly distributed on the sample.Notably, the high-resolution TEM image (Fig. 3h) gives the Cu 2 S nanoparticles with typical lattice feature of Cu 2 S(110) distributing on the amorphous matrix.By counting more than 100 nanoparticles, the diameter distribution is localized in 1.2-4.0nm with an average size at 2.4 nm.The refined geometry of Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst was further characterized by the highresolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images (Fig. 3i, j and S6), where the Cu 2 S nanoparticles could be easily distinguished from each other by the different brightness contrast.The Cu 2 S nanoparticles show the crystallized lattice as confirmed by a fast Fourier transform (FFT) analysis and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns (Figs.S5h andS7).Notably, these nanoparticles have irregular border, which might be due to the strong interaction between Cu 2 S nanoparticles and the amorphous matrix.This feature should be reasonably attributed to the synthesis procedures, where the Cu 2 S nanoparticles were crystallized from the CuS x matrix.High-resolution STEM images of the amorphous region show atomic observation of isolated Cu sites, which randomly distribute on the CuS x matrix, in good agreement with the amorphous feature.These results confirm the proposed structure of the Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst with nanosized Cu 2 S particles on the amorphous CuS x matrix.Such structure should efficiently form Cu 2 S-CuS x heterojunctions and abundant defects.In contrast, the bulky Cu 2 S sample has highly crystallized nanoparticles with diameter at 30-100 nm (Figs.S8 and S9). The catalysis of various catalysts was evaluated in the CO 2 reduction under visible light irradiation (400-780 nm) at room temperature.The CO and H 2 generation rates of the Cu-based catalysts are shown in Fig. 4(a).The blank run without irradiation failed to convert CO 2 (Fig. S10).The referenced catalysts such as Cu, Cu 2 O, and CuO are poorly active, giving extremely low CO production in a reaction for 12 h (Figs.S11 andS12) 35,36.Interestingly, the Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst efficiently catalyzed the CO 2 reduction, giving average CO productivity at 4.0 mmol h A1 with undetectable other carbon-containing products.In this process, the hydrogen generation rate was 0.47 mmol h A1 , which is much lower than that of CO, suggesting most of the hydrogen species have been utilized for the CO 2 reduction rather than HER.In addition, gaseous oxygen with yield of 2.1 mmol h A1 was detected in the emission gas, showing the average generation rate ratio of O 2 / (CO H 2 ) close to 1:2, in good agreement with the photoreaction processes involving CO 2 reduction and water oxidation reactions 11,12,15,16,18,19.To further identify the origin of the CO product, we employed the isotopically labeled 13 CO 2 as feed, giving 13 CO as the product with undetectable unlabeled CO, confirming the CO is from the reduction of 13 CO 2 feedstock (Fig. 4b).In addi-tion, the generation of O 2 and H 2 is further confirmed by the MS signals.In contrast, the bulky Cu 2 S exhibited the average CO productivity at 0.35 mmol h A1 under equivalent reaction conditions, which is much lower than that of Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst.These data mean the high activity of Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst that even outperforms catalysts containing noble metals 22,23 and Bi-based catalysts at comparable reaction conditions 15,16,37, which have been reported to be highly efficient for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction (Table S1). Fig. 4(c) shows dependences of CO and hydrogen yields on time over different catalysts.The Cu 2 S/CuS x continuously produced CO with the irradiation time, giving average CO yield of 50.5 mmol in 12 h.The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) (Fig. S13) of Cu 2 S/ CuS x appeared at 0.11 in the CO 2 reduction with photoirradiation at 420 nm, while the bulky Cu 2 S exhibited much lower AQE at 0.01.The performance of Cu 2 S/CuS x was further evaluated in the CO 2 reduction under photoirradiation with varied wavelengths (Fig. 4d).The Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst gave average CO productivity at 4.7 mmol h A1 under the photoirradiation of k 380 nm.Under visible light irradiation (k 420 nm), the average CO productivity still appeared at 4.1 mmol h A1 .The Cu 2 S/CuS x was still active even under the photoirradiation at k 550 nm, showing the CO productivity at 1.3 mmol h A1 .These data indicate that the high activity of Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst in a wide range of irradiation wavelengths.Very importantly, the Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst is stable under the reaction conditions and easily reused, exhibiting almost unchanged performances in the recycle tests (Fig. 4e).For example, the CO productivity at 4.0 mmol h A1 was still obtained in the 6th run, which is similar to that of the as-synthesized catalyst.Further characterizations using XRD, XPS, UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectrum and TEM (Figs.S14-S17) indicate the almost unchanged structure of the fresh and used Cu 2 S/CuS x catalysts, demonstrating the catalyst stability. Considering that the Cu 2 S/CuS x and bulky Cu 2 S catalysts have similar compositions of Cu and S, the remarkably distinguishable catalytic performances should be reasonably assigned to the different structures.In addition to the charge separation, the interaction between catalyst surface and CO 2 is crucial for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction 4,8,15,16.Therefore, we performed the FT-IR spectra to probe the interaction between CO 2 and catalyst surface under dark conditions.As shown in Fig. 5(a), the Cu 2 S/CuS x gave a band at 618 cm A1 assigned to the Cu-S bond 38.When CO 2 was introduced to the catalyst, an additional signal appeared at 637 cm A1 assigning to the weak Cu-O bond 39, suggesting the bonding interaction between CO 2 and the Cu species.After sweeping the catalyst with flowing Ar, the adsorbed CO 2 could be removed as confirmed by the disappearance of Cu-O signal.Under the equivalent test, the Cu-O interaction was undetectable on the bulky Cu 2 S catalyst, suggesting the negligible interaction with CO 2 .The strong interaction of CO 2 on Cu 2 S/CuS x is also confirmed by the temperature-programmed CO 2 desorption measurements (Fig. S18), which should be reasonably attributed to the abundant defects on amorphous CuS x matrix that has been identified as sites for adsorbing CO 2 . Fig. 5(b) shows in-situ Raman spectra for studying the CO 2 adsorption on the catalyst surface.The as-synthesized Cu 2 S/CuS x shows the modes at 270 and 471 cm A1 assigned to Cu-S bond 40,41.These modes were blue shifted after CO 2 adsorption, which might be due to the formation of CuA A AOCO interaction.When the feed gas was switched to Ar to remove the CO 2 on the surface, the Raman modes were shifted back to the original wavenumbers, indicating the reversibility of Cu 2 S/CuS x surface.For the bulky Cu 2 S sample, the Raman modes were unchanged during the CO 2 treat-ments (Fig. S19), due to the lack of interaction between CO 2 and the catalyst surface, which is in good agreement with the results of FT-IR study.In-situ DRIFTS under photoirradiation was performed to gain more insight into the reaction process (room temperature, visible light).When a wet CO 2 feed gas was introduced into the Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst (Fig. 5c), new bands appeared at 1392, 1531 and 1688 cm A1 and then strengthened with the irradiation time.The peak at 1392 cm A1 indicates the formation of HCOO species, which is stable on the catalyst surface and difficult to be transformed 42.The peak at 1531 cm A1 was assigned to the COOH species, an important intermediate for the CO 2 -to-CO transformation 19,43.The peak at 1688 cm A1 was attributed to the asymmetric stretching of HCO 3 44.Further reaction with irradiation led to the generation of gaseous CO with bands at 2065 and 2077 cm A1 .Because of the instability of COOH and easy decomposition to form CO. Under the equivalent in-situ DRIFTS study, the bulky Cu 2 S sample (Fig. S20) exhibits the signals of COOH (1531 cm A1 ) and HCO 3 (1692 cm A1 ), confirming the similar reaction channels with that over Cu 2 S/CuS x .However, the concentration of these intermediates on bulky Cu 2 S are much lower than those on the Cu 2 S/CuS x sample, and the band of gaseous CO was almost undetectable even in a long reaction period, which might explain the different activities on the catalysts. Based on these data, it is clearly demonstrated that the CO 2 photoreduction proceeds the chemical adsorption of CO 2 , and the proton-electron pair transfer to give COOH intermediate.Further proton-coupled electron addition leads to the decomposition of COOH to form CO and water.The CO species easily desorb from the catalyst surface to gaseous CO (Fig. S21).Such reaction pathway is very similar to those previously identified in the photocatalytic systems using Cu-based catalysts 19,45, where the hydrogen intermediate stabilization and interaction with CO 2 are regarded crucial.Following these knowledges, we investigated the hydrogen species on the catalysts by 1 H MAS NMR (Fig. 5d, S22 and S23).The blank run with Cu 2 S/CuS x in H 2 O without photoirradiation has no signal, because light is necessary for water splitting (Fig. S22).When light irradiation was induced, resonance at 1.23 ppm assigned to SH species appeared to suggest the generation of abundant protons on the catalyst under photoirradiation, which is well known as a light reaction.Introducing CO 2 to the catalyst leads to reduction of the SH signal without photoirradiation, forming new resonances at 7.98 and 9.92 ppm assigning to the HCOO and COOH species, which suggests that the protons participate in the CO 2 reduction, which is well known as a dark reaction (Fig. 5d).These results might explain the high activity for CO 2 reduction and efficient hindrance of HER on the Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst.The H species should be stabilized on the amorphous CuS x matrix, because the crystallized Cu 2 S is active for the HER 46,47, exhibiting extremely weak SH signal in the NMR test (Fig. S23).The reaction with H 2 O and CO 2 under light irradiation also gives signals of HCOO and SH species, where the signal of HCOO is stronger than that of SH, and the COOH species is almost undetectable.These phenomena are due to the transformation of COOH to gaseous CO, and the formed HCOO still exists in the reaction system because of its stability and difficulty in further transformation 48.In the dark reaction with feeding H 2 O/CO 2 , the HCOO and COOH species are almost undetectable on the bulky Cu 2 S (Fig. S23), which might be due to the weak ability to adsorb and reduce CO 2 . Further insight into the crucial role of hydrogen species in CO 2 reduction was performed by kinetic isotopic effects (KIE) study using D-labelled water (D 2 O).On the Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst, the CO production rate was decreased with D 2 O compared with that using H 2 O, giving the KIE at 1.33 (Fig. S24).This phenomenon suggests that the hydrogen intermediates control the reaction rate on the Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst, because the larger D diffuses more slowly and is less active than H.In contrast, the CO formation rate was very similar using H 2 O and D 2 O over bulky Cu 2 S catalyst, giving the KIE at 1.06, which might be explained by the weak CO 2 adsorption/activation, making it as the rate-control step that is different from that on the Cu 2 S/CuS x . Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to study the CO 2 reduction with active hydrogen species on the Cu 2 S (110) surface, S vacancies were artificially controlled to simulate the surface of highly crystallized Cu 2 S (intact Cu 2 S) and amorphous CuS x matrix with abundant defects (defect-rich Cu 2 S) (Fig. 5e, f andS25).The defect-rich surface gives the adsorption energy (E ads ) to split H species at 0.30 eV on the S site (Fig. S26), such appropriate adsorption strength should benefit the H migration on the surface of amorphous CuS x (Fig. S27).In addition, the electrons are favorably trapped at the defect sites located slightly below the conduction band edge 49.These features benefit the efficient hydrogen transfer to adsorbed CO 2 species at the defect-rich matrix.In contrast, the intact Cu 2 S surface shows much higher E ads at 1.75 eV for H adsorption on the S site (Fig. S28), such strong adsorption is unfavorable for the subsequent reaction with CO 2 species.The different H diffusion ability on the highly crystallized and defect-rich Cu 2 S surface was also confirmed experimentally by the hydrogen spillover test, which is known as proton-electron pair transfer on the reducible surface 49.By loading Pt on the Cu-based catalysts and using WO 3 to detect the spilled H species, and gaseous hydrogen was introduced to the sample, the WO 3 -mixed Pt/Cu 2 S/CuS x sample turned to dark color more rapidly than that on Pt/bulky Cu 2 S (Fig. S29).This phenomenon indicates the facile proton-electron transfer on the Cu 2 S/CuS x . The Gibbs free energy (G) profiles of the CO 2 to CO with H atom on the catalysts are provided in Fig. 5(g).The reaction starts from CO 2 adsorption, giving Gibbs free energy at A0.02 eV and 0.05 eV for the defect-rich Cu 2 S and intact Cu 2 S surface, respectively.Notably, the co-adsorption of CO 2 and H is much more feasible on the defect-rich Cu 2 S (G A1.81eV), which is well consistent with the experimental results.The diffusion of H atoms to CO 2 , leading to the consequent generation of COOH (0.20 eV) and CO (A1.25 eV) intermediates.Such feature leads to efficient CO formation on the defect-rich surface (Figs.S30-S32, Table S2).In contrast, the transformation of CO 2 to CO on the bulky Cu 2 S catalyst, need to overcome higher energy barriers for the coadsorption of CO 2 and H (G 1.43 eV), resulting into poor CO yield in the experimental tests."}, {"llm generation": "Monochromatic", "source": "The Cu 2 S/CuS x was still active even under the photoirradiation at k 550 nm, showing the CO productivity at 1.3 mmol h A1 .", "context": "The catalysts were synthesized by a facile and scalable method, that is the solvothermal treatment of copper acetylacetonate with CS(NH 2 ) 2 , hexamethylenetetramine (HMT), and NH 4 F in ethylene glycol, as shown in Fig. 1.The solvothermal treatment at moderate temperature delayed the nucleation (100 C for 12 h), forming an amorphous CuS x matrix containing partially crystallized Cu 2 S nanoparticles, denoted as Cu 2 S/CuS x .For comparison, the general Cu 2 S crystals (denoted as bulky Cu 2 S) were obtained by similar procedures at 200 C for 24 h for adequate crystallization. The obtained samples were characterized by a set of physical techniques.Fig. 2(a) gives XRD patterns of Cu 2 S/CuS x and bulky Cu 2 S samples, showing peaks assigned to the typical Cu 2 S structure.The Cu 2 S/CuS x exhibits much weaker intensity and larger full width at half maxima (FWHM) because of the low crystallinity that might mean the formation of abundant defects.Ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) diffuse reflectance spectra (Fig. 2b) were conducted to study the electronic band structure, and both samples have intense absorption ranging from ultraviolet to visible region with energy band gaps at 2.07 eV for Cu 2 S/CuS x and 2.18 eV for bulky Cu 2 S. Fig. 2(c) shows low-temperature (120 K) solid electron spinresonance (ESR) spectra with the signals at g 2.075, attributed to electrons trapped on the surface defects 31.Notably, the ESR signal of Cu 2 S/CuS x is much stronger than that of bulky Cu 2 S, demonstrating the abundant defects on the former catalyst.Additionally, a pretreatment with CO 2 reduced the ESR signal on Cu 2 S/ CuS x sample, exhibiting a strong CO 2 adsorption that eliminates surface defects by interacting with CO 2 , which should benefit the CO 2 reduction in the photocatalysis.Photoluminescence (PL) spectra (Fig. 2d) were used to characterize the electron-hole separation on the samples, which show obvious PL emissions at 465 nm ascribed to the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs.The PL emission intensity of Cu 2 S/CuS x is much lower than that of bulky Cu 2 S, indicating that the Cu 2 S/CuS x could more effectively hinder the electron-hole recombination than bulky Cu 2 S. Fig. 2(e) shows transient photocurrent curve of the Cu 2 S/CuS x exhibiting much higher photocurrent than bulky Cu 2 S, which reveals the fast generation and transfer of abundant electron-hole pairs on the Cu 2 S/CuS x sample under irradiation, a feature that is favorable for photocatalysis 32.X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) indicate the presence of copper and sulfur on the two samples, where the Cu LMM AES signal at 916.8 eV and S2p signals at 162.5/163.3eV are assigned to the Cu and S 2A /S 2 2A , respectively (Figs.S1-S3) 33,34.These data are the typical characteristics of Cu 2 S materials.The relative positions of valence band maximum (VBM) of Cu 2 S/CuS x determined by valence-band X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (VB XPS) is 1.33 eV (Fig. 2f).Because of the band gap of Cu 2 S/CuS x is 2.07 eV, the conduction band minimum is inferred to be A0.74 eV, which meets the thermodynamic demands for CO 2 reduction to CO (A0.53 eV) 19. Fig. 3 shows electronic microscopy images that provide direct observation of the catalyst structures.The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images (Fig. 3a, b andS4) of the Cu 2 S/CuS x show irregular morphology.Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Fig. 3c andS5) show amorphous matrix of Cu 2 S/CuS x .EDS maps (Fig. 3d-g) display that Cu and S elements are uniformly distributed on the sample.Notably, the high-resolution TEM image (Fig. 3h) gives the Cu 2 S nanoparticles with typical lattice feature of Cu 2 S(110) distributing on the amorphous matrix.By counting more than 100 nanoparticles, the diameter distribution is localized in 1.2-4.0nm with an average size at 2.4 nm.The refined geometry of Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst was further characterized by the highresolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images (Fig. 3i, j and S6), where the Cu 2 S nanoparticles could be easily distinguished from each other by the different brightness contrast.The Cu 2 S nanoparticles show the crystallized lattice as confirmed by a fast Fourier transform (FFT) analysis and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns (Figs.S5h andS7).Notably, these nanoparticles have irregular border, which might be due to the strong interaction between Cu 2 S nanoparticles and the amorphous matrix.This feature should be reasonably attributed to the synthesis procedures, where the Cu 2 S nanoparticles were crystallized from the CuS x matrix.High-resolution STEM images of the amorphous region show atomic observation of isolated Cu sites, which randomly distribute on the CuS x matrix, in good agreement with the amorphous feature.These results confirm the proposed structure of the Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst with nanosized Cu 2 S particles on the amorphous CuS x matrix.Such structure should efficiently form Cu 2 S-CuS x heterojunctions and abundant defects.In contrast, the bulky Cu 2 S sample has highly crystallized nanoparticles with diameter at 30-100 nm (Figs.S8 and S9). The catalysis of various catalysts was evaluated in the CO 2 reduction under visible light irradiation (400-780 nm) at room temperature.The CO and H 2 generation rates of the Cu-based catalysts are shown in Fig. 4(a).The blank run without irradiation failed to convert CO 2 (Fig. S10).The referenced catalysts such as Cu, Cu 2 O, and CuO are poorly active, giving extremely low CO production in a reaction for 12 h (Figs.S11 andS12) 35,36.Interestingly, the Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst efficiently catalyzed the CO 2 reduction, giving average CO productivity at 4.0 mmol h A1 with undetectable other carbon-containing products.In this process, the hydrogen generation rate was 0.47 mmol h A1 , which is much lower than that of CO, suggesting most of the hydrogen species have been utilized for the CO 2 reduction rather than HER.In addition, gaseous oxygen with yield of 2.1 mmol h A1 was detected in the emission gas, showing the average generation rate ratio of O 2 / (CO H 2 ) close to 1:2, in good agreement with the photoreaction processes involving CO 2 reduction and water oxidation reactions 11,12,15,16,18,19.To further identify the origin of the CO product, we employed the isotopically labeled 13 CO 2 as feed, giving 13 CO as the product with undetectable unlabeled CO, confirming the CO is from the reduction of 13 CO 2 feedstock (Fig. 4b).In addi-tion, the generation of O 2 and H 2 is further confirmed by the MS signals.In contrast, the bulky Cu 2 S exhibited the average CO productivity at 0.35 mmol h A1 under equivalent reaction conditions, which is much lower than that of Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst.These data mean the high activity of Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst that even outperforms catalysts containing noble metals 22,23 and Bi-based catalysts at comparable reaction conditions 15,16,37, which have been reported to be highly efficient for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction (Table S1). Fig. 4(c) shows dependences of CO and hydrogen yields on time over different catalysts.The Cu 2 S/CuS x continuously produced CO with the irradiation time, giving average CO yield of 50.5 mmol in 12 h.The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) (Fig. S13) of Cu 2 S/ CuS x appeared at 0.11 in the CO 2 reduction with photoirradiation at 420 nm, while the bulky Cu 2 S exhibited much lower AQE at 0.01.The performance of Cu 2 S/CuS x was further evaluated in the CO 2 reduction under photoirradiation with varied wavelengths (Fig. 4d).The Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst gave average CO productivity at 4.7 mmol h A1 under the photoirradiation of k 380 nm.Under visible light irradiation (k 420 nm), the average CO productivity still appeared at 4.1 mmol h A1 .The Cu 2 S/CuS x was still active even under the photoirradiation at k 550 nm, showing the CO productivity at 1.3 mmol h A1 .These data indicate that the high activity of Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst in a wide range of irradiation wavelengths.Very importantly, the Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst is stable under the reaction conditions and easily reused, exhibiting almost unchanged performances in the recycle tests (Fig. 4e).For example, the CO productivity at 4.0 mmol h A1 was still obtained in the 6th run, which is similar to that of the as-synthesized catalyst.Further characterizations using XRD, XPS, UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectrum and TEM (Figs.S14-S17) indicate the almost unchanged structure of the fresh and used Cu 2 S/CuS x catalysts, demonstrating the catalyst stability. Considering that the Cu 2 S/CuS x and bulky Cu 2 S catalysts have similar compositions of Cu and S, the remarkably distinguishable catalytic performances should be reasonably assigned to the different structures.In addition to the charge separation, the interaction between catalyst surface and CO 2 is crucial for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction 4,8,15,16.Therefore, we performed the FT-IR spectra to probe the interaction between CO 2 and catalyst surface under dark conditions.As shown in Fig. 5(a), the Cu 2 S/CuS x gave a band at 618 cm A1 assigned to the Cu-S bond 38.When CO 2 was introduced to the catalyst, an additional signal appeared at 637 cm A1 assigning to the weak Cu-O bond 39, suggesting the bonding interaction between CO 2 and the Cu species.After sweeping the catalyst with flowing Ar, the adsorbed CO 2 could be removed as confirmed by the disappearance of Cu-O signal.Under the equivalent test, the Cu-O interaction was undetectable on the bulky Cu 2 S catalyst, suggesting the negligible interaction with CO 2 .The strong interaction of CO 2 on Cu 2 S/CuS x is also confirmed by the temperature-programmed CO 2 desorption measurements (Fig. S18), which should be reasonably attributed to the abundant defects on amorphous CuS x matrix that has been identified as sites for adsorbing CO 2 . Fig. 5(b) shows in-situ Raman spectra for studying the CO 2 adsorption on the catalyst surface.The as-synthesized Cu 2 S/CuS x shows the modes at 270 and 471 cm A1 assigned to Cu-S bond 40,41.These modes were blue shifted after CO 2 adsorption, which might be due to the formation of CuA A AOCO interaction.When the feed gas was switched to Ar to remove the CO 2 on the surface, the Raman modes were shifted back to the original wavenumbers, indicating the reversibility of Cu 2 S/CuS x surface.For the bulky Cu 2 S sample, the Raman modes were unchanged during the CO 2 treat-ments (Fig. S19), due to the lack of interaction between CO 2 and the catalyst surface, which is in good agreement with the results of FT-IR study.In-situ DRIFTS under photoirradiation was performed to gain more insight into the reaction process (room temperature, visible light).When a wet CO 2 feed gas was introduced into the Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst (Fig. 5c), new bands appeared at 1392, 1531 and 1688 cm A1 and then strengthened with the irradiation time.The peak at 1392 cm A1 indicates the formation of HCOO species, which is stable on the catalyst surface and difficult to be transformed 42.The peak at 1531 cm A1 was assigned to the COOH species, an important intermediate for the CO 2 -to-CO transformation 19,43.The peak at 1688 cm A1 was attributed to the asymmetric stretching of HCO 3 44.Further reaction with irradiation led to the generation of gaseous CO with bands at 2065 and 2077 cm A1 .Because of the instability of COOH and easy decomposition to form CO. Under the equivalent in-situ DRIFTS study, the bulky Cu 2 S sample (Fig. S20) exhibits the signals of COOH (1531 cm A1 ) and HCO 3 (1692 cm A1 ), confirming the similar reaction channels with that over Cu 2 S/CuS x .However, the concentration of these intermediates on bulky Cu 2 S are much lower than those on the Cu 2 S/CuS x sample, and the band of gaseous CO was almost undetectable even in a long reaction period, which might explain the different activities on the catalysts. Based on these data, it is clearly demonstrated that the CO 2 photoreduction proceeds the chemical adsorption of CO 2 , and the proton-electron pair transfer to give COOH intermediate.Further proton-coupled electron addition leads to the decomposition of COOH to form CO and water.The CO species easily desorb from the catalyst surface to gaseous CO (Fig. S21).Such reaction pathway is very similar to those previously identified in the photocatalytic systems using Cu-based catalysts 19,45, where the hydrogen intermediate stabilization and interaction with CO 2 are regarded crucial.Following these knowledges, we investigated the hydrogen species on the catalysts by 1 H MAS NMR (Fig. 5d, S22 and S23).The blank run with Cu 2 S/CuS x in H 2 O without photoirradiation has no signal, because light is necessary for water splitting (Fig. S22).When light irradiation was induced, resonance at 1.23 ppm assigned to SH species appeared to suggest the generation of abundant protons on the catalyst under photoirradiation, which is well known as a light reaction.Introducing CO 2 to the catalyst leads to reduction of the SH signal without photoirradiation, forming new resonances at 7.98 and 9.92 ppm assigning to the HCOO and COOH species, which suggests that the protons participate in the CO 2 reduction, which is well known as a dark reaction (Fig. 5d).These results might explain the high activity for CO 2 reduction and efficient hindrance of HER on the Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst.The H species should be stabilized on the amorphous CuS x matrix, because the crystallized Cu 2 S is active for the HER 46,47, exhibiting extremely weak SH signal in the NMR test (Fig. S23).The reaction with H 2 O and CO 2 under light irradiation also gives signals of HCOO and SH species, where the signal of HCOO is stronger than that of SH, and the COOH species is almost undetectable.These phenomena are due to the transformation of COOH to gaseous CO, and the formed HCOO still exists in the reaction system because of its stability and difficulty in further transformation 48.In the dark reaction with feeding H 2 O/CO 2 , the HCOO and COOH species are almost undetectable on the bulky Cu 2 S (Fig. S23), which might be due to the weak ability to adsorb and reduce CO 2 . Further insight into the crucial role of hydrogen species in CO 2 reduction was performed by kinetic isotopic effects (KIE) study using D-labelled water (D 2 O).On the Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst, the CO production rate was decreased with D 2 O compared with that using H 2 O, giving the KIE at 1.33 (Fig. S24).This phenomenon suggests that the hydrogen intermediates control the reaction rate on the Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst, because the larger D diffuses more slowly and is less active than H.In contrast, the CO formation rate was very similar using H 2 O and D 2 O over bulky Cu 2 S catalyst, giving the KIE at 1.06, which might be explained by the weak CO 2 adsorption/activation, making it as the rate-control step that is different from that on the Cu 2 S/CuS x . Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to study the CO 2 reduction with active hydrogen species on the Cu 2 S (110) surface, S vacancies were artificially controlled to simulate the surface of highly crystallized Cu 2 S (intact Cu 2 S) and amorphous CuS x matrix with abundant defects (defect-rich Cu 2 S) (Fig. 5e, f andS25).The defect-rich surface gives the adsorption energy (E ads ) to split H species at 0.30 eV on the S site (Fig. S26), such appropriate adsorption strength should benefit the H migration on the surface of amorphous CuS x (Fig. S27).In addition, the electrons are favorably trapped at the defect sites located slightly below the conduction band edge 49.These features benefit the efficient hydrogen transfer to adsorbed CO 2 species at the defect-rich matrix.In contrast, the intact Cu 2 S surface shows much higher E ads at 1.75 eV for H adsorption on the S site (Fig. S28), such strong adsorption is unfavorable for the subsequent reaction with CO 2 species.The different H diffusion ability on the highly crystallized and defect-rich Cu 2 S surface was also confirmed experimentally by the hydrogen spillover test, which is known as proton-electron pair transfer on the reducible surface 49.By loading Pt on the Cu-based catalysts and using WO 3 to detect the spilled H species, and gaseous hydrogen was introduced to the sample, the WO 3 -mixed Pt/Cu 2 S/CuS x sample turned to dark color more rapidly than that on Pt/bulky Cu 2 S (Fig. S29).This phenomenon indicates the facile proton-electron transfer on the Cu 2 S/CuS x . The Gibbs free energy (G) profiles of the CO 2 to CO with H atom on the catalysts are provided in Fig. 5(g).The reaction starts from CO 2 adsorption, giving Gibbs free energy at A0.02 eV and 0.05 eV for the defect-rich Cu 2 S and intact Cu 2 S surface, respectively.Notably, the co-adsorption of CO 2 and H is much more feasible on the defect-rich Cu 2 S (G A1.81eV), which is well consistent with the experimental results.The diffusion of H atoms to CO 2 , leading to the consequent generation of COOH (0.20 eV) and CO (A1.25 eV) intermediates.Such feature leads to efficient CO formation on the defect-rich surface (Figs.S30-S32, Table S2).In contrast, the transformation of CO 2 to CO on the bulky Cu 2 S catalyst, need to overcome higher energy barriers for the coadsorption of CO 2 and H (G 1.43 eV), resulting into poor CO yield in the experimental tests."}, {"llm generation": "UV-Vis", "source": "In-situ DRIFTS under photoirradiation was performed to gain more insight into the reaction process (room temperature, visible light).", "context": "The catalysts were synthesized by a facile and scalable method, that is the solvothermal treatment of copper acetylacetonate with CS(NH 2 ) 2 , hexamethylenetetramine (HMT), and NH 4 F in ethylene glycol, as shown in Fig. 1.The solvothermal treatment at moderate temperature delayed the nucleation (100 C for 12 h), forming an amorphous CuS x matrix containing partially crystallized Cu 2 S nanoparticles, denoted as Cu 2 S/CuS x .For comparison, the general Cu 2 S crystals (denoted as bulky Cu 2 S) were obtained by similar procedures at 200 C for 24 h for adequate crystallization. The obtained samples were characterized by a set of physical techniques.Fig. 2(a) gives XRD patterns of Cu 2 S/CuS x and bulky Cu 2 S samples, showing peaks assigned to the typical Cu 2 S structure.The Cu 2 S/CuS x exhibits much weaker intensity and larger full width at half maxima (FWHM) because of the low crystallinity that might mean the formation of abundant defects.Ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) diffuse reflectance spectra (Fig. 2b) were conducted to study the electronic band structure, and both samples have intense absorption ranging from ultraviolet to visible region with energy band gaps at 2.07 eV for Cu 2 S/CuS x and 2.18 eV for bulky Cu 2 S. Fig. 2(c) shows low-temperature (120 K) solid electron spinresonance (ESR) spectra with the signals at g 2.075, attributed to electrons trapped on the surface defects 31.Notably, the ESR signal of Cu 2 S/CuS x is much stronger than that of bulky Cu 2 S, demonstrating the abundant defects on the former catalyst.Additionally, a pretreatment with CO 2 reduced the ESR signal on Cu 2 S/ CuS x sample, exhibiting a strong CO 2 adsorption that eliminates surface defects by interacting with CO 2 , which should benefit the CO 2 reduction in the photocatalysis.Photoluminescence (PL) spectra (Fig. 2d) were used to characterize the electron-hole separation on the samples, which show obvious PL emissions at 465 nm ascribed to the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs.The PL emission intensity of Cu 2 S/CuS x is much lower than that of bulky Cu 2 S, indicating that the Cu 2 S/CuS x could more effectively hinder the electron-hole recombination than bulky Cu 2 S. Fig. 2(e) shows transient photocurrent curve of the Cu 2 S/CuS x exhibiting much higher photocurrent than bulky Cu 2 S, which reveals the fast generation and transfer of abundant electron-hole pairs on the Cu 2 S/CuS x sample under irradiation, a feature that is favorable for photocatalysis 32.X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) indicate the presence of copper and sulfur on the two samples, where the Cu LMM AES signal at 916.8 eV and S2p signals at 162.5/163.3eV are assigned to the Cu and S 2A /S 2 2A , respectively (Figs.S1-S3) 33,34.These data are the typical characteristics of Cu 2 S materials.The relative positions of valence band maximum (VBM) of Cu 2 S/CuS x determined by valence-band X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (VB XPS) is 1.33 eV (Fig. 2f).Because of the band gap of Cu 2 S/CuS x is 2.07 eV, the conduction band minimum is inferred to be A0.74 eV, which meets the thermodynamic demands for CO 2 reduction to CO (A0.53 eV) 19. Fig. 3 shows electronic microscopy images that provide direct observation of the catalyst structures.The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images (Fig. 3a, b andS4) of the Cu 2 S/CuS x show irregular morphology.Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Fig. 3c andS5) show amorphous matrix of Cu 2 S/CuS x .EDS maps (Fig. 3d-g) display that Cu and S elements are uniformly distributed on the sample.Notably, the high-resolution TEM image (Fig. 3h) gives the Cu 2 S nanoparticles with typical lattice feature of Cu 2 S(110) distributing on the amorphous matrix.By counting more than 100 nanoparticles, the diameter distribution is localized in 1.2-4.0nm with an average size at 2.4 nm.The refined geometry of Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst was further characterized by the highresolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images (Fig. 3i, j and S6), where the Cu 2 S nanoparticles could be easily distinguished from each other by the different brightness contrast.The Cu 2 S nanoparticles show the crystallized lattice as confirmed by a fast Fourier transform (FFT) analysis and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns (Figs.S5h andS7).Notably, these nanoparticles have irregular border, which might be due to the strong interaction between Cu 2 S nanoparticles and the amorphous matrix.This feature should be reasonably attributed to the synthesis procedures, where the Cu 2 S nanoparticles were crystallized from the CuS x matrix.High-resolution STEM images of the amorphous region show atomic observation of isolated Cu sites, which randomly distribute on the CuS x matrix, in good agreement with the amorphous feature.These results confirm the proposed structure of the Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst with nanosized Cu 2 S particles on the amorphous CuS x matrix.Such structure should efficiently form Cu 2 S-CuS x heterojunctions and abundant defects.In contrast, the bulky Cu 2 S sample has highly crystallized nanoparticles with diameter at 30-100 nm (Figs.S8 and S9). The catalysis of various catalysts was evaluated in the CO 2 reduction under visible light irradiation (400-780 nm) at room temperature.The CO and H 2 generation rates of the Cu-based catalysts are shown in Fig. 4(a).The blank run without irradiation failed to convert CO 2 (Fig. S10).The referenced catalysts such as Cu, Cu 2 O, and CuO are poorly active, giving extremely low CO production in a reaction for 12 h (Figs.S11 andS12) 35,36.Interestingly, the Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst efficiently catalyzed the CO 2 reduction, giving average CO productivity at 4.0 mmol h A1 with undetectable other carbon-containing products.In this process, the hydrogen generation rate was 0.47 mmol h A1 , which is much lower than that of CO, suggesting most of the hydrogen species have been utilized for the CO 2 reduction rather than HER.In addition, gaseous oxygen with yield of 2.1 mmol h A1 was detected in the emission gas, showing the average generation rate ratio of O 2 / (CO H 2 ) close to 1:2, in good agreement with the photoreaction processes involving CO 2 reduction and water oxidation reactions 11,12,15,16,18,19.To further identify the origin of the CO product, we employed the isotopically labeled 13 CO 2 as feed, giving 13 CO as the product with undetectable unlabeled CO, confirming the CO is from the reduction of 13 CO 2 feedstock (Fig. 4b).In addi-tion, the generation of O 2 and H 2 is further confirmed by the MS signals.In contrast, the bulky Cu 2 S exhibited the average CO productivity at 0.35 mmol h A1 under equivalent reaction conditions, which is much lower than that of Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst.These data mean the high activity of Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst that even outperforms catalysts containing noble metals 22,23 and Bi-based catalysts at comparable reaction conditions 15,16,37, which have been reported to be highly efficient for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction (Table S1). Fig. 4(c) shows dependences of CO and hydrogen yields on time over different catalysts.The Cu 2 S/CuS x continuously produced CO with the irradiation time, giving average CO yield of 50.5 mmol in 12 h.The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) (Fig. S13) of Cu 2 S/ CuS x appeared at 0.11 in the CO 2 reduction with photoirradiation at 420 nm, while the bulky Cu 2 S exhibited much lower AQE at 0.01.The performance of Cu 2 S/CuS x was further evaluated in the CO 2 reduction under photoirradiation with varied wavelengths (Fig. 4d).The Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst gave average CO productivity at 4.7 mmol h A1 under the photoirradiation of k 380 nm.Under visible light irradiation (k 420 nm), the average CO productivity still appeared at 4.1 mmol h A1 .The Cu 2 S/CuS x was still active even under the photoirradiation at k 550 nm, showing the CO productivity at 1.3 mmol h A1 .These data indicate that the high activity of Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst in a wide range of irradiation wavelengths.Very importantly, the Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst is stable under the reaction conditions and easily reused, exhibiting almost unchanged performances in the recycle tests (Fig. 4e).For example, the CO productivity at 4.0 mmol h A1 was still obtained in the 6th run, which is similar to that of the as-synthesized catalyst.Further characterizations using XRD, XPS, UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectrum and TEM (Figs.S14-S17) indicate the almost unchanged structure of the fresh and used Cu 2 S/CuS x catalysts, demonstrating the catalyst stability. Considering that the Cu 2 S/CuS x and bulky Cu 2 S catalysts have similar compositions of Cu and S, the remarkably distinguishable catalytic performances should be reasonably assigned to the different structures.In addition to the charge separation, the interaction between catalyst surface and CO 2 is crucial for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction 4,8,15,16.Therefore, we performed the FT-IR spectra to probe the interaction between CO 2 and catalyst surface under dark conditions.As shown in Fig. 5(a), the Cu 2 S/CuS x gave a band at 618 cm A1 assigned to the Cu-S bond 38.When CO 2 was introduced to the catalyst, an additional signal appeared at 637 cm A1 assigning to the weak Cu-O bond 39, suggesting the bonding interaction between CO 2 and the Cu species.After sweeping the catalyst with flowing Ar, the adsorbed CO 2 could be removed as confirmed by the disappearance of Cu-O signal.Under the equivalent test, the Cu-O interaction was undetectable on the bulky Cu 2 S catalyst, suggesting the negligible interaction with CO 2 .The strong interaction of CO 2 on Cu 2 S/CuS x is also confirmed by the temperature-programmed CO 2 desorption measurements (Fig. S18), which should be reasonably attributed to the abundant defects on amorphous CuS x matrix that has been identified as sites for adsorbing CO 2 . Fig. 5(b) shows in-situ Raman spectra for studying the CO 2 adsorption on the catalyst surface.The as-synthesized Cu 2 S/CuS x shows the modes at 270 and 471 cm A1 assigned to Cu-S bond 40,41.These modes were blue shifted after CO 2 adsorption, which might be due to the formation of CuA A AOCO interaction.When the feed gas was switched to Ar to remove the CO 2 on the surface, the Raman modes were shifted back to the original wavenumbers, indicating the reversibility of Cu 2 S/CuS x surface.For the bulky Cu 2 S sample, the Raman modes were unchanged during the CO 2 treat-ments (Fig. S19), due to the lack of interaction between CO 2 and the catalyst surface, which is in good agreement with the results of FT-IR study.In-situ DRIFTS under photoirradiation was performed to gain more insight into the reaction process (room temperature, visible light).When a wet CO 2 feed gas was introduced into the Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst (Fig. 5c), new bands appeared at 1392, 1531 and 1688 cm A1 and then strengthened with the irradiation time.The peak at 1392 cm A1 indicates the formation of HCOO species, which is stable on the catalyst surface and difficult to be transformed 42.The peak at 1531 cm A1 was assigned to the COOH species, an important intermediate for the CO 2 -to-CO transformation 19,43.The peak at 1688 cm A1 was attributed to the asymmetric stretching of HCO 3 44.Further reaction with irradiation led to the generation of gaseous CO with bands at 2065 and 2077 cm A1 .Because of the instability of COOH and easy decomposition to form CO. Under the equivalent in-situ DRIFTS study, the bulky Cu 2 S sample (Fig. S20) exhibits the signals of COOH (1531 cm A1 ) and HCO 3 (1692 cm A1 ), confirming the similar reaction channels with that over Cu 2 S/CuS x .However, the concentration of these intermediates on bulky Cu 2 S are much lower than those on the Cu 2 S/CuS x sample, and the band of gaseous CO was almost undetectable even in a long reaction period, which might explain the different activities on the catalysts. Based on these data, it is clearly demonstrated that the CO 2 photoreduction proceeds the chemical adsorption of CO 2 , and the proton-electron pair transfer to give COOH intermediate.Further proton-coupled electron addition leads to the decomposition of COOH to form CO and water.The CO species easily desorb from the catalyst surface to gaseous CO (Fig. S21).Such reaction pathway is very similar to those previously identified in the photocatalytic systems using Cu-based catalysts 19,45, where the hydrogen intermediate stabilization and interaction with CO 2 are regarded crucial.Following these knowledges, we investigated the hydrogen species on the catalysts by 1 H MAS NMR (Fig. 5d, S22 and S23).The blank run with Cu 2 S/CuS x in H 2 O without photoirradiation has no signal, because light is necessary for water splitting (Fig. S22).When light irradiation was induced, resonance at 1.23 ppm assigned to SH species appeared to suggest the generation of abundant protons on the catalyst under photoirradiation, which is well known as a light reaction.Introducing CO 2 to the catalyst leads to reduction of the SH signal without photoirradiation, forming new resonances at 7.98 and 9.92 ppm assigning to the HCOO and COOH species, which suggests that the protons participate in the CO 2 reduction, which is well known as a dark reaction (Fig. 5d).These results might explain the high activity for CO 2 reduction and efficient hindrance of HER on the Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst.The H species should be stabilized on the amorphous CuS x matrix, because the crystallized Cu 2 S is active for the HER 46,47, exhibiting extremely weak SH signal in the NMR test (Fig. S23).The reaction with H 2 O and CO 2 under light irradiation also gives signals of HCOO and SH species, where the signal of HCOO is stronger than that of SH, and the COOH species is almost undetectable.These phenomena are due to the transformation of COOH to gaseous CO, and the formed HCOO still exists in the reaction system because of its stability and difficulty in further transformation 48.In the dark reaction with feeding H 2 O/CO 2 , the HCOO and COOH species are almost undetectable on the bulky Cu 2 S (Fig. S23), which might be due to the weak ability to adsorb and reduce CO 2 . Further insight into the crucial role of hydrogen species in CO 2 reduction was performed by kinetic isotopic effects (KIE) study using D-labelled water (D 2 O).On the Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst, the CO production rate was decreased with D 2 O compared with that using H 2 O, giving the KIE at 1.33 (Fig. S24).This phenomenon suggests that the hydrogen intermediates control the reaction rate on the Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst, because the larger D diffuses more slowly and is less active than H.In contrast, the CO formation rate was very similar using H 2 O and D 2 O over bulky Cu 2 S catalyst, giving the KIE at 1.06, which might be explained by the weak CO 2 adsorption/activation, making it as the rate-control step that is different from that on the Cu 2 S/CuS x . Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to study the CO 2 reduction with active hydrogen species on the Cu 2 S (110) surface, S vacancies were artificially controlled to simulate the surface of highly crystallized Cu 2 S (intact Cu 2 S) and amorphous CuS x matrix with abundant defects (defect-rich Cu 2 S) (Fig. 5e, f andS25).The defect-rich surface gives the adsorption energy (E ads ) to split H species at 0.30 eV on the S site (Fig. S26), such appropriate adsorption strength should benefit the H migration on the surface of amorphous CuS x (Fig. S27).In addition, the electrons are favorably trapped at the defect sites located slightly below the conduction band edge 49.These features benefit the efficient hydrogen transfer to adsorbed CO 2 species at the defect-rich matrix.In contrast, the intact Cu 2 S surface shows much higher E ads at 1.75 eV for H adsorption on the S site (Fig. S28), such strong adsorption is unfavorable for the subsequent reaction with CO 2 species.The different H diffusion ability on the highly crystallized and defect-rich Cu 2 S surface was also confirmed experimentally by the hydrogen spillover test, which is known as proton-electron pair transfer on the reducible surface 49.By loading Pt on the Cu-based catalysts and using WO 3 to detect the spilled H species, and gaseous hydrogen was introduced to the sample, the WO 3 -mixed Pt/Cu 2 S/CuS x sample turned to dark color more rapidly than that on Pt/bulky Cu 2 S (Fig. S29).This phenomenon indicates the facile proton-electron transfer on the Cu 2 S/CuS x . The Gibbs free energy (G) profiles of the CO 2 to CO with H atom on the catalysts are provided in Fig. 5(g).The reaction starts from CO 2 adsorption, giving Gibbs free energy at A0.02 eV and 0.05 eV for the defect-rich Cu 2 S and intact Cu 2 S surface, respectively.Notably, the co-adsorption of CO 2 and H is much more feasible on the defect-rich Cu 2 S (G A1.81eV), which is well consistent with the experimental results.The diffusion of H atoms to CO 2 , leading to the consequent generation of COOH (0.20 eV) and CO (A1.25 eV) intermediates.Such feature leads to efficient CO formation on the defect-rich surface (Figs.S30-S32, Table S2).In contrast, the transformation of CO 2 to CO on the bulky Cu 2 S catalyst, need to overcome higher energy barriers for the coadsorption of CO 2 and H (G 1.43 eV), resulting into poor CO yield in the experimental tests."}, {"llm generation": "visible light", "source": "The stabilization and diffusion of hydrogen intermediates on the catalyst surface benefit the proton-electron transfer to CO 2 , realizing a biomimetic reaction process with high CO productivity even under visible light irradiation.", "context": "In summary, we designed a Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst consisting of Cu 2 S nanoparticles on amorphous CuS x matrix.The heterojunctions on Cu 2 S nanoparticle and CuS x matrix benefit the light harvesting and water splitting, and the amorphous CuS x surface efficiently adsorbs and activates CO 2 molecules.The stabilization and diffusion of hydrogen intermediates on the catalyst surface benefit the proton-electron transfer to CO 2 , realizing a biomimetic reaction process with high CO productivity even under visible light irradiation.This work should be helpful for the development of efficient catalysts for the CO 2 -elimination-purpose techniques.

Raman spectra were recorded using a HR800 Raman spectrometer equipped with an Ar excitation source (k 514.532nm).For investigating the CO 2 adsorption, CO 2 was continuously introduced into the chamber, then the spectra were collected.Then, Ar was flowed to the sample to collect the signal during CO 2 desorption (Fig. 5b andS19). The CO 2 photoreduction was carried out in a Teflon-lined stainless reaction chamber (100 cm 3 ) with a quartz window at the top for light irradiation.As a typical run, 20 mg of catalyst and 5 mL of H 2 O were mixed into the reactor.The reactor was sealed and flushed five times with 1 MPa of CO 2 to remove the air, then the CO 2 gas was charged to the desired pressure of 0.18 MPa.A 300 W Xe lamp (Beijing China Education Au-light Co., Ltd, CEL-HXF300) was employed as light source, with an output light density to the catalyst location in the reactor at 0.112 W cm A2 measured by a spectroradiometer, and the wavelengths were controlled by different filters.After reaction, the composition of gas in the autoclave was analyzed with a Fu Li-9790 gas phase chromatograph (GC) equipped with thermal conductivity detector (TCD).The liquor was separated from the solid catalyst by centrifugation and analyzed by a Fu Li-9790 GC equipped with flame ionization detector (FID).To evaluate the wavelength-dependent CO 2 photoreduction performance of Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst, the wavelengths of irradiation light were controlled by long-pass cutoff filters.In the recycle tests, the solid catalyst was separated by centrifugation, washed with deionized water, dried at 80 C for 2 h, and then used in the next run."}, {"llm generation": "Continuous", "source": "The Cu 2 S/CuS x continuously produced CO with the irradiation time, giving average CO yield of 50.5 mmol in 12 h.", "context": "The catalysts were synthesized by a facile and scalable method, that is the solvothermal treatment of copper acetylacetonate with CS(NH 2 ) 2 , hexamethylenetetramine (HMT), and NH 4 F in ethylene glycol, as shown in Fig. 1.The solvothermal treatment at moderate temperature delayed the nucleation (100 C for 12 h), forming an amorphous CuS x matrix containing partially crystallized Cu 2 S nanoparticles, denoted as Cu 2 S/CuS x .For comparison, the general Cu 2 S crystals (denoted as bulky Cu 2 S) were obtained by similar procedures at 200 C for 24 h for adequate crystallization. The obtained samples were characterized by a set of physical techniques.Fig. 2(a) gives XRD patterns of Cu 2 S/CuS x and bulky Cu 2 S samples, showing peaks assigned to the typical Cu 2 S structure.The Cu 2 S/CuS x exhibits much weaker intensity and larger full width at half maxima (FWHM) because of the low crystallinity that might mean the formation of abundant defects.Ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) diffuse reflectance spectra (Fig. 2b) were conducted to study the electronic band structure, and both samples have intense absorption ranging from ultraviolet to visible region with energy band gaps at 2.07 eV for Cu 2 S/CuS x and 2.18 eV for bulky Cu 2 S. Fig. 2(c) shows low-temperature (120 K) solid electron spinresonance (ESR) spectra with the signals at g 2.075, attributed to electrons trapped on the surface defects 31.Notably, the ESR signal of Cu 2 S/CuS x is much stronger than that of bulky Cu 2 S, demonstrating the abundant defects on the former catalyst.Additionally, a pretreatment with CO 2 reduced the ESR signal on Cu 2 S/ CuS x sample, exhibiting a strong CO 2 adsorption that eliminates surface defects by interacting with CO 2 , which should benefit the CO 2 reduction in the photocatalysis.Photoluminescence (PL) spectra (Fig. 2d) were used to characterize the electron-hole separation on the samples, which show obvious PL emissions at 465 nm ascribed to the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs.The PL emission intensity of Cu 2 S/CuS x is much lower than that of bulky Cu 2 S, indicating that the Cu 2 S/CuS x could more effectively hinder the electron-hole recombination than bulky Cu 2 S. Fig. 2(e) shows transient photocurrent curve of the Cu 2 S/CuS x exhibiting much higher photocurrent than bulky Cu 2 S, which reveals the fast generation and transfer of abundant electron-hole pairs on the Cu 2 S/CuS x sample under irradiation, a feature that is favorable for photocatalysis 32.X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) indicate the presence of copper and sulfur on the two samples, where the Cu LMM AES signal at 916.8 eV and S2p signals at 162.5/163.3eV are assigned to the Cu and S 2A /S 2 2A , respectively (Figs.S1-S3) 33,34.These data are the typical characteristics of Cu 2 S materials.The relative positions of valence band maximum (VBM) of Cu 2 S/CuS x determined by valence-band X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (VB XPS) is 1.33 eV (Fig. 2f).Because of the band gap of Cu 2 S/CuS x is 2.07 eV, the conduction band minimum is inferred to be A0.74 eV, which meets the thermodynamic demands for CO 2 reduction to CO (A0.53 eV) 19. Fig. 3 shows electronic microscopy images that provide direct observation of the catalyst structures.The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images (Fig. 3a, b andS4) of the Cu 2 S/CuS x show irregular morphology.Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Fig. 3c andS5) show amorphous matrix of Cu 2 S/CuS x .EDS maps (Fig. 3d-g) display that Cu and S elements are uniformly distributed on the sample.Notably, the high-resolution TEM image (Fig. 3h) gives the Cu 2 S nanoparticles with typical lattice feature of Cu 2 S(110) distributing on the amorphous matrix.By counting more than 100 nanoparticles, the diameter distribution is localized in 1.2-4.0nm with an average size at 2.4 nm.The refined geometry of Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst was further characterized by the highresolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images (Fig. 3i, j and S6), where the Cu 2 S nanoparticles could be easily distinguished from each other by the different brightness contrast.The Cu 2 S nanoparticles show the crystallized lattice as confirmed by a fast Fourier transform (FFT) analysis and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns (Figs.S5h andS7).Notably, these nanoparticles have irregular border, which might be due to the strong interaction between Cu 2 S nanoparticles and the amorphous matrix.This feature should be reasonably attributed to the synthesis procedures, where the Cu 2 S nanoparticles were crystallized from the CuS x matrix.High-resolution STEM images of the amorphous region show atomic observation of isolated Cu sites, which randomly distribute on the CuS x matrix, in good agreement with the amorphous feature.These results confirm the proposed structure of the Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst with nanosized Cu 2 S particles on the amorphous CuS x matrix.Such structure should efficiently form Cu 2 S-CuS x heterojunctions and abundant defects.In contrast, the bulky Cu 2 S sample has highly crystallized nanoparticles with diameter at 30-100 nm (Figs.S8 and S9). The catalysis of various catalysts was evaluated in the CO 2 reduction under visible light irradiation (400-780 nm) at room temperature.The CO and H 2 generation rates of the Cu-based catalysts are shown in Fig. 4(a).The blank run without irradiation failed to convert CO 2 (Fig. S10).The referenced catalysts such as Cu, Cu 2 O, and CuO are poorly active, giving extremely low CO production in a reaction for 12 h (Figs.S11 andS12) 35,36.Interestingly, the Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst efficiently catalyzed the CO 2 reduction, giving average CO productivity at 4.0 mmol h A1 with undetectable other carbon-containing products.In this process, the hydrogen generation rate was 0.47 mmol h A1 , which is much lower than that of CO, suggesting most of the hydrogen species have been utilized for the CO 2 reduction rather than HER.In addition, gaseous oxygen with yield of 2.1 mmol h A1 was detected in the emission gas, showing the average generation rate ratio of O 2 / (CO H 2 ) close to 1:2, in good agreement with the photoreaction processes involving CO 2 reduction and water oxidation reactions 11,12,15,16,18,19.To further identify the origin of the CO product, we employed the isotopically labeled 13 CO 2 as feed, giving 13 CO as the product with undetectable unlabeled CO, confirming the CO is from the reduction of 13 CO 2 feedstock (Fig. 4b).In addi-tion, the generation of O 2 and H 2 is further confirmed by the MS signals.In contrast, the bulky Cu 2 S exhibited the average CO productivity at 0.35 mmol h A1 under equivalent reaction conditions, which is much lower than that of Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst.These data mean the high activity of Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst that even outperforms catalysts containing noble metals 22,23 and Bi-based catalysts at comparable reaction conditions 15,16,37, which have been reported to be highly efficient for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction (Table S1). Fig. 4(c) shows dependences of CO and hydrogen yields on time over different catalysts.The Cu 2 S/CuS x continuously produced CO with the irradiation time, giving average CO yield of 50.5 mmol in 12 h.The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) (Fig. S13) of Cu 2 S/ CuS x appeared at 0.11 in the CO 2 reduction with photoirradiation at 420 nm, while the bulky Cu 2 S exhibited much lower AQE at 0.01.The performance of Cu 2 S/CuS x was further evaluated in the CO 2 reduction under photoirradiation with varied wavelengths (Fig. 4d).The Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst gave average CO productivity at 4.7 mmol h A1 under the photoirradiation of k 380 nm.Under visible light irradiation (k 420 nm), the average CO productivity still appeared at 4.1 mmol h A1 .The Cu 2 S/CuS x was still active even under the photoirradiation at k 550 nm, showing the CO productivity at 1.3 mmol h A1 .These data indicate that the high activity of Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst in a wide range of irradiation wavelengths.Very importantly, the Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst is stable under the reaction conditions and easily reused, exhibiting almost unchanged performances in the recycle tests (Fig. 4e).For example, the CO productivity at 4.0 mmol h A1 was still obtained in the 6th run, which is similar to that of the as-synthesized catalyst.Further characterizations using XRD, XPS, UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectrum and TEM (Figs.S14-S17) indicate the almost unchanged structure of the fresh and used Cu 2 S/CuS x catalysts, demonstrating the catalyst stability. Considering that the Cu 2 S/CuS x and bulky Cu 2 S catalysts have similar compositions of Cu and S, the remarkably distinguishable catalytic performances should be reasonably assigned to the different structures.In addition to the charge separation, the interaction between catalyst surface and CO 2 is crucial for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction 4,8,15,16.Therefore, we performed the FT-IR spectra to probe the interaction between CO 2 and catalyst surface under dark conditions.As shown in Fig. 5(a), the Cu 2 S/CuS x gave a band at 618 cm A1 assigned to the Cu-S bond 38.When CO 2 was introduced to the catalyst, an additional signal appeared at 637 cm A1 assigning to the weak Cu-O bond 39, suggesting the bonding interaction between CO 2 and the Cu species.After sweeping the catalyst with flowing Ar, the adsorbed CO 2 could be removed as confirmed by the disappearance of Cu-O signal.Under the equivalent test, the Cu-O interaction was undetectable on the bulky Cu 2 S catalyst, suggesting the negligible interaction with CO 2 .The strong interaction of CO 2 on Cu 2 S/CuS x is also confirmed by the temperature-programmed CO 2 desorption measurements (Fig. S18), which should be reasonably attributed to the abundant defects on amorphous CuS x matrix that has been identified as sites for adsorbing CO 2 . Fig. 5(b) shows in-situ Raman spectra for studying the CO 2 adsorption on the catalyst surface.The as-synthesized Cu 2 S/CuS x shows the modes at 270 and 471 cm A1 assigned to Cu-S bond 40,41.These modes were blue shifted after CO 2 adsorption, which might be due to the formation of CuA A AOCO interaction.When the feed gas was switched to Ar to remove the CO 2 on the surface, the Raman modes were shifted back to the original wavenumbers, indicating the reversibility of Cu 2 S/CuS x surface.For the bulky Cu 2 S sample, the Raman modes were unchanged during the CO 2 treat-ments (Fig. S19), due to the lack of interaction between CO 2 and the catalyst surface, which is in good agreement with the results of FT-IR study.In-situ DRIFTS under photoirradiation was performed to gain more insight into the reaction process (room temperature, visible light).When a wet CO 2 feed gas was introduced into the Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst (Fig. 5c), new bands appeared at 1392, 1531 and 1688 cm A1 and then strengthened with the irradiation time.The peak at 1392 cm A1 indicates the formation of HCOO species, which is stable on the catalyst surface and difficult to be transformed 42.The peak at 1531 cm A1 was assigned to the COOH species, an important intermediate for the CO 2 -to-CO transformation 19,43.The peak at 1688 cm A1 was attributed to the asymmetric stretching of HCO 3 44.Further reaction with irradiation led to the generation of gaseous CO with bands at 2065 and 2077 cm A1 .Because of the instability of COOH and easy decomposition to form CO. Under the equivalent in-situ DRIFTS study, the bulky Cu 2 S sample (Fig. S20) exhibits the signals of COOH (1531 cm A1 ) and HCO 3 (1692 cm A1 ), confirming the similar reaction channels with that over Cu 2 S/CuS x .However, the concentration of these intermediates on bulky Cu 2 S are much lower than those on the Cu 2 S/CuS x sample, and the band of gaseous CO was almost undetectable even in a long reaction period, which might explain the different activities on the catalysts. Based on these data, it is clearly demonstrated that the CO 2 photoreduction proceeds the chemical adsorption of CO 2 , and the proton-electron pair transfer to give COOH intermediate.Further proton-coupled electron addition leads to the decomposition of COOH to form CO and water.The CO species easily desorb from the catalyst surface to gaseous CO (Fig. S21).Such reaction pathway is very similar to those previously identified in the photocatalytic systems using Cu-based catalysts 19,45, where the hydrogen intermediate stabilization and interaction with CO 2 are regarded crucial.Following these knowledges, we investigated the hydrogen species on the catalysts by 1 H MAS NMR (Fig. 5d, S22 and S23).The blank run with Cu 2 S/CuS x in H 2 O without photoirradiation has no signal, because light is necessary for water splitting (Fig. S22).When light irradiation was induced, resonance at 1.23 ppm assigned to SH species appeared to suggest the generation of abundant protons on the catalyst under photoirradiation, which is well known as a light reaction.Introducing CO 2 to the catalyst leads to reduction of the SH signal without photoirradiation, forming new resonances at 7.98 and 9.92 ppm assigning to the HCOO and COOH species, which suggests that the protons participate in the CO 2 reduction, which is well known as a dark reaction (Fig. 5d).These results might explain the high activity for CO 2 reduction and efficient hindrance of HER on the Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst.The H species should be stabilized on the amorphous CuS x matrix, because the crystallized Cu 2 S is active for the HER 46,47, exhibiting extremely weak SH signal in the NMR test (Fig. S23).The reaction with H 2 O and CO 2 under light irradiation also gives signals of HCOO and SH species, where the signal of HCOO is stronger than that of SH, and the COOH species is almost undetectable.These phenomena are due to the transformation of COOH to gaseous CO, and the formed HCOO still exists in the reaction system because of its stability and difficulty in further transformation 48.In the dark reaction with feeding H 2 O/CO 2 , the HCOO and COOH species are almost undetectable on the bulky Cu 2 S (Fig. S23), which might be due to the weak ability to adsorb and reduce CO 2 . Further insight into the crucial role of hydrogen species in CO 2 reduction was performed by kinetic isotopic effects (KIE) study using D-labelled water (D 2 O).On the Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst, the CO production rate was decreased with D 2 O compared with that using H 2 O, giving the KIE at 1.33 (Fig. S24).This phenomenon suggests that the hydrogen intermediates control the reaction rate on the Cu 2 S/CuS x catalyst, because the larger D diffuses more slowly and is less active than H.In contrast, the CO formation rate was very similar using H 2 O and D 2 O over bulky Cu 2 S catalyst, giving the KIE at 1.06, which might be explained by the weak CO 2 adsorption/activation, making it as the rate-control step that is different from that on the Cu 2 S/CuS x . Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to study the CO 2 reduction with active hydrogen species on the Cu 2 S (110) surface, S vacancies were artificially controlled to simulate the surface of highly crystallized Cu 2 S (intact Cu 2 S) and amorphous CuS x matrix with abundant defects (defect-rich Cu 2 S) (Fig. 5e, f andS25).The defect-rich surface gives the adsorption energy (E ads ) to split H species at 0.30 eV on the S site (Fig. S26), such appropriate adsorption strength should benefit the H migration on the surface of amorphous CuS x (Fig. S27).In addition, the electrons are favorably trapped at the defect sites located slightly below the conduction band edge 49.These features benefit the efficient hydrogen transfer to adsorbed CO 2 species at the defect-rich matrix.In contrast, the intact Cu 2 S surface shows much higher E ads at 1.75 eV for H adsorption on the S site (Fig. S28), such strong adsorption is unfavorable for the subsequent reaction with CO 2 species.The different H diffusion ability on the highly crystallized and defect-rich Cu 2 S surface was also confirmed experimentally by the hydrogen spillover test, which is known as proton-electron pair transfer on the reducible surface 49.By loading Pt on the Cu-based catalysts and using WO 3 to detect the spilled H species, and gaseous hydrogen was introduced to the sample, the WO 3 -mixed Pt/Cu 2 S/CuS x sample turned to dark color more rapidly than that on Pt/bulky Cu 2 S (Fig. S29).This phenomenon indicates the facile proton-electron transfer on the Cu 2 S/CuS x . The Gibbs free energy (G) profiles of the CO 2 to CO with H atom on the catalysts are provided in Fig. 5(g).The reaction starts from CO 2 adsorption, giving Gibbs free energy at A0.02 eV and 0.05 eV for the defect-rich Cu 2 S and intact Cu 2 S surface, respectively.Notably, the co-adsorption of CO 2 and H is much more feasible on the defect-rich Cu 2 S (G A1.81eV), which is well consistent with the experimental results.The diffusion of H atoms to CO 2 , leading to the consequent generation of COOH (0.20 eV) and CO (A1.25 eV) intermediates.Such feature leads to efficient CO formation on the defect-rich surface (Figs.S30-S32, Table S2).In contrast, the transformation of CO 2 to CO on the bulky Cu 2 S catalyst, need to overcome higher energy barriers for the coadsorption of CO 2 and H (G 1.43 eV), resulting into poor CO yield in the experimental tests."}]}}
