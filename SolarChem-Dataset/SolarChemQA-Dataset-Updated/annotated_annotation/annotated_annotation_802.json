Kelvin probe technology with single-point measurements over 600 points was applied to determine work functions of the two semiconductor materials, as shown in Fig. 6.Since CPD for Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 is higher than that for BiVO 4 , therefore the work function (WF) of Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 (5.78eV) is higher than that of BiVO 4 (5.5 eV).Further combined with electron affinity data (EA) of Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 (5.868The charge transfer direction in the BiVO 4 /Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 sample was confirmed by a photoinduced redox probe reactions, Pt 4 e - Pt, and Mn 2 h OH - MnO x 7.shows some weak IR bands in the range of 1000 -1600 cm -1 on the BiVO 4 /10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 , which belongs to different adsorption states of CO 2 32,46.However, after light irradiation, besides the surface adsorption species CO 2 observed before illumination, other some bicarbonate species were found, such as the formate (HCOO -) species at 1340 cm -1 , monodentate carbonate at 1539 cm -1 , bidentate carbonate at 1238 cm -1 and 1160 cm -1 , and methoxy at 1029 and 1078 cm -1 47,48.This suggests that CO 2 undergoes these complex intermediate states and is finally reduced to CH 3 OH and CO on the photocatalyst. The possible reduction mechanism of CO 2 over the BiVO 4 /Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 heterojunction composites is proposed in Fig. 11, based on the above results and the previous reports 49,50.Products CO and CH 3 OH may be produced from two parallel photocatalytic routes.First, CO 2 molecule is adsorbed on the surface of BiVO H into one carboxyl radical and then further reduced by another photogenerated electron and H to CO and H 2 O.The whole process can be expressed as CO 2 H 2 O CO 1/2O 2 H 2 O (where H 2 O takes part in the reaction, but it was eventually released).This mechanism is similar to that on BiOBr we suggested previously 2.(ii) It is reduced by the two photogenerated electron and 2H into -CH 2 O 2 species, and then undergoes the subsequent series processes, including the hole-oxidizing lattice oxygen, the oxygen vacancy despoiling O 2-in H 2 O, the reaction with photogenerated electrons and H ions, etc., finally to CH 3 OH step by step.The whole process can be expressed with chemical equation CO 2 2H 2 O CH 3 OH 3/2O 2 .Because the two routes involve similar intermediate species, in theory there should be near product selectivity.But in fact, selectivity of CH 3 OH is slightly higher than that of CO, which can be related with the dosage of reactant H 2 O (this result will be published in separated paper)."}], "lamp": [{"llm generation": "Xenon", "source": "The UV-vis irradiation source was a 300 W Xe lamp.", "context": "All the chemical reagents were of analytical grade and purchased from Aladdin Industrial Corporation and used without further purification.Deionized water was used throughout the work.

The possible reduction mechanism of CO 2 over the BiVO 4 /Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 heterojunction composites is proposed in Fig. 11, based on the above results and the previous reports 49,50.Products CO and CH 3 OH may be produced from two parallel photocatalytic routes.First, CO 2 molecule is adsorbed on the surface of BiVO H into one carboxyl radical and then further reduced by another photogenerated electron and H to CO and H 2 O.The whole process can be expressed as CO 2 H 2 O CO 1/2O 2 H 2 O (where H 2 O takes part in the reaction, but it was eventually released).This mechanism is similar to that on BiOBr we suggested previously 2.(ii) It is reduced by the two photogenerated electron and 2H into -CH 2 O 2 species, and then undergoes the subsequent series processes, including the hole-oxidizing lattice oxygen, the oxygen vacancy despoiling O 2-in H 2 O, the reaction with photogenerated electrons and H ions, etc., finally to CH 3 OH step by step.The whole process can be expressed with chemical equation CO 2 2H 2 O CH 3 OH 3/2O 2 .Because the two routes involve similar intermediate species, in theory there should be near product selectivity.But in fact, selectivity of CH 3 OH is slightly higher than that of CO, which can be related with the dosage of reactant H 2 O (this result will be published in separated paper)."}], "reaction medium": [{"llm generation": "Liquid", "source": "BiVO4 /Bi4Ti3O12 heterojunction enabling efficient photocatalytic reduction of CO2 with H2O to CH3OH and CO", "context": "BiVO4 /Bi4Ti3O12 heterojunction enabling efficient photocatalytic reduction of CO2 with H2O to CH3OH and CO"}, {"llm generation": "Liquid", "source": "The novel composite photocatalyst has excellent photocatalytic ability to reduce CO 2 with H 2 O into CH 3 OH and CO.", "context": "Construction of composite semiconductors is an effective solution to elevate the efficiency of photocatalysis by prolonging lifetime of photogenerated hole and electrons.Herein, a heterojunction structure composite BiVO 4 / Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 was synthesized via a facile in situ hydrothermal condition.The novel composite photocatalyst has excellent photocatalytic ability to reduce CO 2 with H 2 O into CH 3 OH and CO.The BiVO 4 /10 Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 sample shows the highest yields of CH 3 OH and CO up to 16.6 and 13.29 mol g -1 h -1 , which was 12.39 and 5.68 times higher than that of pure BiVO 4 , and 9.88 and 2.80 times higher than that of pure Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 , respectively.Such a high activity is attributed to the type II heterojunction structure which significantly enhances separation of photogenerated carriers and promotes collaboration between the water oxidation on the Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 and the CO 2 reduction on BiVO 4 .The photocatalytic reaction mechanism of CO 2 on the composite was proposed according to experiment results."}, {"llm generation": "Gas", "source": "The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O vapor was carried out in a 270 mL Schlenk flask reactor under atmospheric pressure at ambient temperature (298 K).", "context": "All the chemical reagents were of analytical grade and purchased from Aladdin Industrial Corporation and used without further purification.Deionized water was used throughout the work. The molten salt synthesis method was used to prepare Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 , where Bi 2 O 3 and TiO 2 (anatase) were used as raw materials.Since mole ratio of Bi 2 O 3 to TiO 2 is 2:3 in Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 , Bi 2 O 3 and TiO 2 were mixed by the stoichiometric amounts.Then, NaCl, KCl and Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 were mixed at a mole ratio of 60:60:1 and continuously grinded for over 30 min with an agate mortar and pestle.The resulting mixture was then calcined at 800 C for 2 h in Muffle furnace.The mixed NaCl and KCl can be totally melted at 800 C according to the eutectic point, which is the vital steps for the generation of Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 .The resulting white product was washed with deionized water until the ion concentration gets close to zero, followed by overnight drying in an electric oven at 333 K.

A clear orange solution was formed after vigorous stirring, and then to which different molar ratios of Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 was added.In order to adjust the acid concentration to 1 M, the prepared solution was diluted by a certain amount of de-ionized water.The final resulting 35 mL solution was transferred into a 50 ml Teflon-lined autoclave and maintained at 423 K for 12 h, followed by naturally cooling to room temperature.The final product was gathered by centrifugation, rinsed thoroughly with deionized water, followed by desiccation at 60 C in air overnight for further characterization.By the in situ hydrothermal method, BiVO 4 / Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 samples with different mole ratios (20 mol, 10 mol, and 5 mol ) of Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 were prepared for comparison.In addition, the nude BiVO 4 as a reference sample was prepared also by the hydrothermal method similar to the above procedure but no adding Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 .For simplicity, Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 will be abbreviated as BTO and BiVO 4 done as BVO hereinafter.
