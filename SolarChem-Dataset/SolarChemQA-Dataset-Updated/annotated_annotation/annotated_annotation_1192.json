Photocatalytic Activity Test.The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction was performed in a quartz reactor.Ten milligrams of the prepared catalyst and 2 mg of Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 were added into a solution containing 450 L of acetonitrile (MeCN), 300 L of H 2 O, and 150 L of triethanolamine (TEOA).The reactor was first vacuumed by a pump and then filled with high-purity CO 2 .After repeating the process three times, the reactor was irradiated with a 300 W Xe lamp equipped with a 400 nm cutoff filter under mild stirring.The gas products were quantitatively analyzed using an Agilent 7890B gas chromatograph.Meanwhile, the liquid products were detected by liquid chromatography (Agilent 1290 Infinity II).directly prove the decoration of Co(OH) 2 on the surface of H 2 Ti 6 O 13 ."}, {"llm generation": "Visible light", "source": "Subsequently, the photocatalytic performance of the samples has been evaluated for CO 2 reduction in a classic tandem dyesensitization system using the H 2 O/MeCN/TEOA mixture as the reaction medium under visible light illumination ( 400 nm).", "context": "Moreover, Figure 2e-f and Figure S5 show the AFM measurement of the samples, which is carried out to quantitatively analyze the thickness of the materials.The bare H 2 Ti 6 O 13 shows a typical thickness of 1.6-2.0nm.Interestingly, after the modification of Co(OH) 2 , the thickness of the composite nanosheets decreases to ca. 0.8 nm, which is only half of that of the bare H 2 Ti 6 O 13 .The decrease in thickness can be ascribed to the secondary peeling of the H 2 Ti 6 O 13 nanosheets promoted by the addition of N 2 H 4 H 2 O in the hydrothermal process.Moreover, alkaline N 2 H 4 H 2 O is also favorable to facilitate the desorption of intercalators adsorbed on the nanosheet surface.Consequently, Co(OH) 2 / H 2 Ti 6 O 13 displays a cleaner surface and thinner thickness (monolayer).This could expose more surface sites, which have high potential in the field of CO 2 photoreduction. To further identify the composition and valence states of elements in Co(OH) 2 /H 2 Ti 6 O 13 , XPS characterization is conducted.As presented in Figure 3a, the spin-orbit split doublet peaks of Ti 2p located at around 458.3 (2p 3/2 ) and 464.0 eV (2p 1/2 ) can be ascribed to Ti 4 species, 37 while the peaks of O 1s at 529.9 and 531.7 eV are assigned to the lattice oxygen of the catalyst and surface hydroxyl groups from the absorbed water molecules, respectively. 38,39The Ti 2p and O 1s spectra are analogous to those of bare H 2 Ti 6 O 13 , further validating the maintainence of the chemical structure of nanosheets.Additionally, compared to bare H 2 Ti 6 O 13 , two additional peaks located at 781.0 (2p 3/2 ) and 796.2 (2p 1/2 ) eV are observed for Co(OH) 2 /H 2 Ti 6 O 13 , which belong to the Co 2 of Co(OH) 2 . 40The result consolidates the presence of Co(OH) 2 in the Co(OH) 2 /H 2 Ti 6 O 13 composite.Moreover, Figure 3b shows the photoabsorption properties of the prepared samples characterized by a UV-vis DRS spectrometer, which also clarifies the formation of Co(OH) 2 /H 2 Ti 6 O 13 .H 2 Ti 6 O 13 displays obvious UV light capture with a band edge at about 360 nm.With the introduction of Co(OH) 2 , the light absorption of Co(OH) 2 /H 2 Ti 6 O 13 gradually shifts to a high wavelength.Meanwhile, a slight absorption peak appears and enhances with the increase of Co(OH) 2 in the range from 500 to 700 nm, 41,42 which originates from the Co(II) d-d transition.Thus, based on the above collective analyses, it can be concluded that the Co(OH) 2 nanoparticles are successfully assembled onto the ultrathin monolayer H 2 Ti 6 O 13 nanosheets, forming the hybrid Co(OH) 2 / H 2 Ti 6 O 13 composite. Subsequently, the photocatalytic performance of the samples has been evaluated for CO 2 reduction in a classic tandem dyesensitization system using the H 2 O/MeCN/TEOA mixture as the reaction medium under visible light illumination ( 400 nm).A Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 photosensitizer is employed as a photosensitizer due to its high absorption coefficient for visible light. 43As shown in Figure 4a while it shows an H 2 evolution rate of about 59.3 mol h -1 .Meanwhile, no liquid products such as CH 3 OH and HCOOH are detected through analyzing the reaction solution by liquid chromatography after photocatalytic reactions.A further increase in Co(OH) 2 results in gradually reduced CO production.The CO yield rate decreases from 34.9 mol h -1 for the 1.0 wt Co(OH) 2 content to 23.9 mol h -1 for 1.8 wt Co(OH) 2 /H 2 Ti 6 O 13 .The inhibited CO evolution could be due to the blocking of active sites and increment of recombination centers caused by the agglomeration of excessive amount of Co(OH) 2 . 9,44,45Notably, the produced CO/H 2 ratio can be tuned from 1:1 to 1:2.4 by changing the weight content of Co(OH) 2 .The tailored H 2 /CO ratio in the syngas is critical for the production of chemicals.For example, the 2:1 ratio of H 2 /CO is beneficial for the F-T synthesis to produce hydrocarbon and methanol, while the 1:1 ratio of H 2 / CO is desirable for the hydroformylation of alkenes to produce aldehydes. 46The present Co(OH) 2 /H 2 Ti 6 O 13 composites provide a feasible approach to facilely adjust the H 2 /CO ratio for target applications. To validate the light-induced photocatalytic CO 2 reduction and study the catalytic role of Co(OH) 2 /H 2 Ti 6 O 13 , a series of controlled experiments have been performed.As displayed in Table 1, the photoreduction of CO 2 cannot proceed without Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 .In addition, no product is generated in a dark reaction or a healing reaction without light.These findings prove that the CO 2 reduction over the Co(OH) 2 /H 2 Ti 6 O 13 -Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 system is light-driven.When MeCN or TEOA is removed from the system, the reaction activity decreased sharply.This can be ascribed to the fact that the presence of TEOA can trap photoinduced holes to prohibit the electronhole recombination, while MeCN used as a solvent is beneficial for enhancing the CO 2 solubility in the system. 47When CO 2 is replaced with N 2 , negligible CO product is detected, indicating that CO 2 is the essential resource of the CO product.Moreover, without Co(OH) 2 /H 2 Ti 6 O 13 , the reaction system only produces a very small amount of CO.This is mainly due to the fact that in the bare dye sensitization system, the lifetime of excited dye molecules is usually too short, which suffers from the severe recombination drawback of photoelectrons, thus leading to an inferior activity. 48In addition, it is notable that the CO yield of Co(OH) 2 /H 2 Ti 6 O 13 nanosheets is significantly higher than that of Co(OH) 2 /layered H 2 Ti 6 O 13 (Figure S6).In addition, the photoactivity of Co(OH) 2 / H 2 Ti 6 O 13 is much higher than that of the Co(OH) 2 /TiO 2 composite (14.7 mol h -1 for CO and 11.1 mol h -1 for H 2 ), denoting a superiority of ultrathin Co(OH) 2 /H 2 Ti 6 O 13 .This can be ascribed to the fact that the thin nanosheet effectively reduces the charge diffusion length and acts as a more efficient electron relay to promote the electron migration from the Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 sensitizer to the Co(OH) 2 active sites.This finding emphasizes the critical effect of the ultrathin structure in improving the catalytic performance of the Co(OH) 2 / H 2 Ti 6 O 13 composite.Furthermore, Figure 4b shows the photocatalytic stability of the Co(OH) 2 /H 2 Ti 6 O 13 catalyst.After four repeated experiments, the CO yield rate maintains a stable value, revealing the durability of the Co(OH) 2decorated H 2 Ti 6 O 13 nanosheets.These phenomena validate that Co(OH) 2 /H 2 Ti 6 O 13 is efficient and stable for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to produce tunable syngas. To better understand the photocatalytic mechanism for the enhanced CO 2 reduction over the catalysts, photoelectrochemical measurements of the bare H 2 Ti 6 O 13 and hybrid Co(OH) 2 / H 2 Ti 6 O 13 composites have been carried out.To simulate the reaction system, the test is performed in the solution containing Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 , TEOA, H 2 O, and MeCN.As presented in Figure 5a, compared with the bare H 2 Ti 6 O 13 , the Co(OH) 2 -modified H 2 Ti 6 O 13 nanosheets display a significantly depressed PL spectrum intensity, indicating an inhibited recombination of photoinduced electron-hole pairs.Meanwhile, the photocurrent responses show that after the Co(OH) 2 modification, Co(OH) 2 /H 2 Ti 6 O 13 reveals a remarkably higher photocurrent response than the bare H 2 Ti 6 O 13 , as shown in Figure 5b, demonstrating the great promotion effect of Co(OH) 2 in facilitating the separation of photoinduced charge carriers.Moreover, Figures 5c andS7 display the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) characterization, which is employed to explore the interfacial charge transfer of the samples.According to the fitted equivalent circuit diagram (Figure S8 and Table S1), the presence of Co(OH) 2 leads to a significantly declined arc radius at the lowfrequency region, suggesting a decreased surface resistance for charge transfer within the interface between the Co(OH) 2 / H 2 Ti 6 O 13 sample and electrolyte. 49,50Collectively, the above analyses demonstrate that the load of Co(OH) 2 on H 2 Ti 6 O 13 could significantly lower the resistance of electron transfer and promote the separation of photogenerated carriers, thereby increasing the utilization efficiency of the electron-hole pairs to prevent recombination.Furthermore, to examine the effect of Co(OH) 2 decoration on the CO 2 capture of the catalysts, CO 2 adsorption on bare H 2 Ti 6 O 13 and hybrid Co(OH) 2 /H 2 Ti 6 O 13 has been carried out.As displayed in Figure 5d, the CO 2 adsorption isotherms of the bare H 2 Ti 6 O 13 and Co(OH) 2 /H 2 Ti 6 O 13 reveal that the hybrid Co(OH) 2 /H 2 Ti 6 O 13 exhibits a much higher CO 2 adsorption ability, indicating a stronger interaction with CO 2 of the as-prepared composite.This is mainly because alkaline Co(OH) 2 is in favor of the adsorption of the acidic CO 2 molecule. 51 than bare Co(OH) 2 (17.5 m 2 g -1 ) (Figure S9).This might be caused by the secondary peeling of the nanosheets (Figure 2ef and Figure S5) induced in the hydrothermal treatment.Nevertheless, the enhancement is slight.In particular, the surface area values for different Co(OH) 2 /H 2 Ti 6 O 13 samples are close, which are not consistent with the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance (Figure 4a).Thus, the specific surface area is not a crucial factor affecting the performance of Co(OH) ).In addition, an obvious peak ascribed to H 2 O is observed at 1636 cm -1 .The detection of carbon and water species indicates a chemical interaction of the CO 2 and H 2 O molecules on the catalyst surface, which is a significant initial step for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.Notably, the detected CO 2 -vibration peak implies a spontaneous electron migration from the catalyst to the absorbed CO 2 . 52The phenomenon illustrates that Co(OH) 2 / H 2 Ti 6 O 13 contributes to the chemical adsorption and activation of CO 2 . Moreover, it is notable that the characteristic peaks of Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 shift positively for Co(OH) 2 /H 2 Ti 6 O 13 -Ru-(bpy) 3 Cl 2 , as exemplified in the enlarged inset of Figure 5e (from 1268 to 1270 cm -1 ), which suggests a strong interaction between the adsorbed photosensitizer and Co(OH) 2 / H 2 Ti 6 O 13 .This has also been confirmed by the light absorption extending from H 2 Ti 6 O 13 after the adsorption of Ru(bpy) 3 -Cl 2 (Figure S10).Given that the sensitization first requires the adsorption of the sensitizer on the catalyst surface, the strong interaction would greatly promote the photoinduced charge transfer from Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 to Co(OH) 2 /H 2 Ti 6 O 13 .Consequently, in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction process, the electron-enriched Co(OH) 2 /H 2 Ti 6 O 13 sample could activate and reduce the inert CO 2 molecule readily. With prolonging irradiation time under visible light from 1 to 2 h, the peak intensity of m-CO 3 2-does not change significantly, while a notable increase is observed for the peaks of CO 2 -and H 2 O.The result indicates that m-CO 3 2-is not the active species within the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.On the contrary, the CO 2 -species is suggested to be the main intermediate for the CO 2 reduction reaction, and the surfaceabsorbed H 2 O is the donor of protons. 52Therefore, in combination with the results in photoelectrochemical analyses, it can be concluded that the introduction of Co(OH) 2 not only accelerates the photoinduced charge carrier separation and migration but also promotes the adsorption-activation of the CO 2 molecules.This greatly directs the flow of photoinduced charge carriers from the light absorber to the CO 2 molecule, thus benefitting the CO generation. Ultimately, according to the above experimental results and analyses, a possible CO 2 photocatalytic reduction mechanism over the Co(OH) 2 /H 2 Ti 6 O 13 -Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 system is proposed.As schematically illustrated in Figure 6, owing to the visible-light-induced electron transition from the highest occupied molecular orbital to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital, 48 Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 under irradiation is first excited to generate photoelectrons.Then, based on the strong interaction of the Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 sensitizer with the H 2 Ti 6 O 13 nanosheets, the photoelectrons are rapidly injected into H 2 Ti 6 O 13 , 48 which acts as an electron relay and a reaction matrix to prohibit the recombination of the photoelectrons with the excited sensitizer.With the modification of Co(OH) 2 , the photoelectrons further migrate to Co(OH) 2 due to its cocatalytic function, which is verified to be efficient for trapping photoelectrons. 40,53Concurrently, since the CO 2 molecules are absorbed and activated at the Co(OH) 2 sites, as demonstrated by the CO 2 adsorption experiment and in situ FTIR analysis, in such a case, the photogenerated electrons can efficiently migrate to and reduce the activated CO 2 molecules, thus generating CO at the Co(OH) 2 sites.In addition, the photoelectrons transferred to H 2 Ti 6 O 13 could also take part in photocatalytic water splitting due to the competing reduction potential of H /H 2 , thereby producing H 2 .Moreover, owing to the addition of TEOA, the sensitized Ru(bpy) 3 3 can be reduced to Ru(bpy) 3 2 to ensure the cycle of the reaction."}], "lamp": [{"llm generation": "Xenon (Xe lamp)", "source": "A 300 W Xe lamp equipped with a 400 nm cutoff filter is selected as the light source.", "context": "Preparation of H 2 Ti 6 O 13 Nanosheets.Layered H 2 Ti 6 O 13 was first synthesized via a calcination method. 34,35Then, 4 mL of tetrabutylammonium hydroxide was introduced into 1 L aqueous solution of the as-prepared layered H 2 Ti 6 O 13 (2 g) and stirred for a week.The dispersion was centrifuged to remove the precipitate.After that, 50 mL of HCl solution with a concentration of 1 mol/L was dropped into the obtained 50 mL colloid to obtain the precipitate.After washing with deionized (DI) water, the obtained H 2 Ti 6 O 13 nanosheets were vacuum-freeze-dried.

To further identify the composition and valence states of elements in Co(OH) 2 /H 2 Ti 6 O 13 , XPS characterization is conducted.As presented in Figure 3a, the spin-orbit split doublet peaks of Ti 2p located at around 458.3 (2p 3/2 ) and 464.0 eV (2p 1/2 ) can be ascribed to Ti 4 species, 37 while the peaks of O 1s at 529.9 and 531.7 eV are assigned to the lattice oxygen of the catalyst and surface hydroxyl groups from the absorbed water molecules, respectively. 38,39The Ti 2p and O 1s spectra are analogous to those of bare H 2 Ti 6 O 13 , further validating the maintainence of the chemical structure of nanosheets.Additionally, compared to bare H 2 Ti 6 O 13 , two additional peaks located at 781.0 (2p 3/2 ) and 796.2 (2p 1/2 ) eV are observed for Co(OH) 2 /H 2 Ti 6 O 13 , which belong to the Co 2 of Co(OH) 2 . 40The result consolidates the presence of Co(OH) 2 in the Co(OH) 2 /H 2 Ti 6 O 13 composite.Moreover, Figure 3b shows the photoabsorption properties of the prepared samples characterized by a UV-vis DRS spectrometer, which also clarifies the formation of Co(OH) 2 /H 2 Ti 6 O 13 .H 2 Ti 6 O 13 displays obvious UV light capture with a band edge at about 360 nm.With the introduction of Co(OH) 2 , the light absorption of Co(OH) 2 /H 2 Ti 6 O 13 gradually shifts to a high wavelength.Meanwhile, a slight absorption peak appears and enhances with the increase of Co(OH) 2 in the range from 500 to 700 nm, 41,42 which originates from the Co(II) d-d transition.Thus, based on the above collective analyses, it can be concluded that the Co(OH) 2 nanoparticles are successfully assembled onto the ultrathin monolayer H 2 Ti 6 O 13 nanosheets, forming the hybrid Co(OH) 2 / H 2 Ti 6 O 13 composite. Subsequently, the photocatalytic performance of the samples has been evaluated for CO 2 reduction in a classic tandem dyesensitization system using the H 2 O/MeCN/TEOA mixture as the reaction medium under visible light illumination ( 400 nm).A Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 photosensitizer is employed as a photosensitizer due to its high absorption coefficient for visible light. 43As shown in Figure 4a while it shows an H 2 evolution rate of about 59.3 mol h -1 .Meanwhile, no liquid products such as CH 3 OH and HCOOH are detected through analyzing the reaction solution by liquid chromatography after photocatalytic reactions.A further increase in Co(OH) 2 results in gradually reduced CO production.The CO yield rate decreases from 34.9 mol h -1 for the 1.0 wt Co(OH) 2 content to 23.9 mol h -1 for 1.8 wt Co(OH) 2 /H 2 Ti 6 O 13 .The inhibited CO evolution could be due to the blocking of active sites and increment of recombination centers caused by the agglomeration of excessive amount of Co(OH) 2 . 9,44,45Notably, the produced CO/H 2 ratio can be tuned from 1:1 to 1:2.4 by changing the weight content of Co(OH) 2 .The tailored H 2 /CO ratio in the syngas is critical for the production of chemicals.For example, the 2:1 ratio of H 2 /CO is beneficial for the F-T synthesis to produce hydrocarbon and methanol, while the 1:1 ratio of H 2 / CO is desirable for the hydroformylation of alkenes to produce aldehydes. 46The present Co(OH) 2 /H 2 Ti 6 O 13 composites provide a feasible approach to facilely adjust the H 2 /CO ratio for target applications. To validate the light-induced photocatalytic CO 2 reduction and study the catalytic role of Co(OH) 2 /H 2 Ti 6 O 13 , a series of controlled experiments have been performed.As displayed in Table 1, the photoreduction of CO 2 cannot proceed without Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 .In addition, no product is generated in a dark reaction or a healing reaction without light.These findings prove that the CO 2 reduction over the Co(OH) 2 /H 2 Ti 6 O 13 -Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 system is light-driven.When MeCN or TEOA is removed from the system, the reaction activity decreased sharply.This can be ascribed to the fact that the presence of TEOA can trap photoinduced holes to prohibit the electronhole recombination, while MeCN used as a solvent is beneficial for enhancing the CO 2 solubility in the system. 47When CO 2 is replaced with N 2 , negligible CO product is detected, indicating that CO 2 is the essential resource of the CO product.Moreover, without Co(OH) 2 /H 2 Ti 6 O 13 , the reaction system only produces a very small amount of CO.This is mainly due to the fact that in the bare dye sensitization system, the lifetime of excited dye molecules is usually too short, which suffers from the severe recombination drawback of photoelectrons, thus leading to an inferior activity. 48In addition, it is notable that the CO yield of Co(OH) 2 /H 2 Ti 6 O 13 nanosheets is significantly higher than that of Co(OH) 2 /layered H 2 Ti 6 O 13 (Figure S6).In addition, the photoactivity of Co(OH) 2 / H 2 Ti 6 O 13 is much higher than that of the Co(OH) 2 /TiO 2 composite (14.7 mol h -1 for CO and 11.1 mol h -1 for H 2 ), denoting a superiority of ultrathin Co(OH) 2 /H 2 Ti 6 O 13 .This can be ascribed to the fact that the thin nanosheet effectively reduces the charge diffusion length and acts as a more efficient electron relay to promote the electron migration from the Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 sensitizer to the Co(OH) 2 active sites.This finding emphasizes the critical effect of the ultrathin structure in improving the catalytic performance of the Co(OH) 2 / H 2 Ti 6 O 13 composite.Furthermore, Figure 4b shows the photocatalytic stability of the Co(OH) 2 /H 2 Ti 6 O 13 catalyst.After four repeated experiments, the CO yield rate maintains a stable value, revealing the durability of the Co(OH) 2decorated H 2 Ti 6 O 13 nanosheets.These phenomena validate that Co(OH) 2 /H 2 Ti 6 O 13 is efficient and stable for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to produce tunable syngas. To better understand the photocatalytic mechanism for the enhanced CO 2 reduction over the catalysts, photoelectrochemical measurements of the bare H 2 Ti 6 O 13 and hybrid Co(OH) 2 / H 2 Ti 6 O 13 composites have been carried out.To simulate the reaction system, the test is performed in the solution containing Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 , TEOA, H 2 O, and MeCN.As presented in Figure 5a, compared with the bare H 2 Ti 6 O 13 , the Co(OH) 2 -modified H 2 Ti 6 O 13 nanosheets display a significantly depressed PL spectrum intensity, indicating an inhibited recombination of photoinduced electron-hole pairs.Meanwhile, the photocurrent responses show that after the Co(OH) 2 modification, Co(OH) 2 /H 2 Ti 6 O 13 reveals a remarkably higher photocurrent response than the bare H 2 Ti 6 O 13 , as shown in Figure 5b, demonstrating the great promotion effect of Co(OH) 2 in facilitating the separation of photoinduced charge carriers.Moreover, Figures 5c andS7 display the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) characterization, which is employed to explore the interfacial charge transfer of the samples.According to the fitted equivalent circuit diagram (Figure S8 and Table S1), the presence of Co(OH) 2 leads to a significantly declined arc radius at the lowfrequency region, suggesting a decreased surface resistance for charge transfer within the interface between the Co(OH) 2 / H 2 Ti 6 O 13 sample and electrolyte. 49,50Collectively, the above analyses demonstrate that the load of Co(OH) 2 on H 2 Ti 6 O 13 could significantly lower the resistance of electron transfer and promote the separation of photogenerated carriers, thereby increasing the utilization efficiency of the electron-hole pairs to prevent recombination.Furthermore, to examine the effect of Co(OH) 2 decoration on the CO 2 capture of the catalysts, CO 2 adsorption on bare H 2 Ti 6 O 13 and hybrid Co(OH) 2 /H 2 Ti 6 O 13 has been carried out.As displayed in Figure 5d, the CO 2 adsorption isotherms of the bare H 2 Ti 6 O 13 and Co(OH) 2 /H 2 Ti 6 O 13 reveal that the hybrid Co(OH) 2 /H 2 Ti 6 O 13 exhibits a much higher CO 2 adsorption ability, indicating a stronger interaction with CO 2 of the as-prepared composite.This is mainly because alkaline Co(OH) 2 is in favor of the adsorption of the acidic CO 2 molecule. 51 than bare Co(OH) 2 (17.5 m 2 g -1 ) (Figure S9).This might be caused by the secondary peeling of the nanosheets (Figure 2ef and Figure S5) induced in the hydrothermal treatment.Nevertheless, the enhancement is slight.In particular, the surface area values for different Co(OH) 2 /H 2 Ti 6 O 13 samples are close, which are not consistent with the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance (Figure 4a).Thus, the specific surface area is not a crucial factor affecting the performance of Co(OH) ).In addition, an obvious peak ascribed to H 2 O is observed at 1636 cm -1 .The detection of carbon and water species indicates a chemical interaction of the CO 2 and H 2 O molecules on the catalyst surface, which is a significant initial step for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.Notably, the detected CO 2 -vibration peak implies a spontaneous electron migration from the catalyst to the absorbed CO 2 . 52The phenomenon illustrates that Co(OH) 2 / H 2 Ti 6 O 13 contributes to the chemical adsorption and activation of CO 2 . Moreover, it is notable that the characteristic peaks of Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 shift positively for Co(OH) 2 /H 2 Ti 6 O 13 -Ru-(bpy) 3 Cl 2 , as exemplified in the enlarged inset of Figure 5e (from 1268 to 1270 cm -1 ), which suggests a strong interaction between the adsorbed photosensitizer and Co(OH) 2 / H 2 Ti 6 O 13 .This has also been confirmed by the light absorption extending from H 2 Ti 6 O 13 after the adsorption of Ru(bpy) 3 -Cl 2 (Figure S10).Given that the sensitization first requires the adsorption of the sensitizer on the catalyst surface, the strong interaction would greatly promote the photoinduced charge transfer from Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 to Co(OH) 2 /H 2 Ti 6 O 13 .Consequently, in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction process, the electron-enriched Co(OH) 2 /H 2 Ti 6 O 13 sample could activate and reduce the inert CO 2 molecule readily. With prolonging irradiation time under visible light from 1 to 2 h, the peak intensity of m-CO 3 2-does not change significantly, while a notable increase is observed for the peaks of CO 2 -and H 2 O.The result indicates that m-CO 3 2-is not the active species within the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.On the contrary, the CO 2 -species is suggested to be the main intermediate for the CO 2 reduction reaction, and the surfaceabsorbed H 2 O is the donor of protons. 52Therefore, in combination with the results in photoelectrochemical analyses, it can be concluded that the introduction of Co(OH) 2 not only accelerates the photoinduced charge carrier separation and migration but also promotes the adsorption-activation of the CO 2 molecules.This greatly directs the flow of photoinduced charge carriers from the light absorber to the CO 2 molecule, thus benefitting the CO generation. Ultimately, according to the above experimental results and analyses, a possible CO 2 photocatalytic reduction mechanism over the Co(OH) 2 /H 2 Ti 6 O 13 -Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 system is proposed.As schematically illustrated in Figure 6, owing to the visible-light-induced electron transition from the highest occupied molecular orbital to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital, 48 Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 under irradiation is first excited to generate photoelectrons.Then, based on the strong interaction of the Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 sensitizer with the H 2 Ti 6 O 13 nanosheets, the photoelectrons are rapidly injected into H 2 Ti 6 O 13 , 48 which acts as an electron relay and a reaction matrix to prohibit the recombination of the photoelectrons with the excited sensitizer.With the modification of Co(OH) 2 , the photoelectrons further migrate to Co(OH) 2 due to its cocatalytic function, which is verified to be efficient for trapping photoelectrons. 40,53Concurrently, since the CO 2 molecules are absorbed and activated at the Co(OH) 2 sites, as demonstrated by the CO 2 adsorption experiment and in situ FTIR analysis, in such a case, the photogenerated electrons can efficiently migrate to and reduce the activated CO 2 molecules, thus generating CO at the Co(OH) 2 sites.In addition, the photoelectrons transferred to H 2 Ti 6 O 13 could also take part in photocatalytic water splitting due to the competing reduction potential of H /H 2 , thereby producing H 2 .Moreover, owing to the addition of TEOA, the sensitized Ru(bpy) 3 3 can be reduced to Ru(bpy) 3 2 to ensure the cycle of the reaction."}, {"llm generation": "Liquid (TEOA/H2O/MeCN solvent)", "source": "Photocatalytic CO 2 Reduction Performance under Different Reaction Conditions Ti 6 O 13 under different reaction conditions: a Ru-(bpy) 3 Cl 2 , 0.6 wt Co(OH) 2 /H 2 Ti 6 O 13 , TEOA/H 2 O/MeCN solvent (volume ratio of 1:2:3), CO 2 atmosphere, and 400 nm.", "context": "In summary, a series of alkaline Co(OH) 2 -decorated ultrathin titanic acid nanosheet catalysts have been fabricated by a soft chemical process and subsequently utilized for the syngas production from dye-sensitized CO 2 photoreduction.In the design, the H 2 Ti 6 O 13 nanosheets not only are a supporter of catalytically active Co(OH) 2 but also strongly bind the Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 photosensitizer to perform as an electron relay.The obtained Co(OH) 2 /H 2 Ti 6 O 13 composite effectively promotes CO 2 adsorption-activation and facilitates photoinduced charge carrier separation and transfer.By regulating the modification amount of Co(OH) 2 , the composition of the produced syngas can be tuned flexibly in the photocatalytic process.As a result, the 0.6 wt Co(OH) 2 /H 2 Ti 6 O 13 exhibits an optimal CO/H 2 yield rate of 56.5/59.3mol h -1 (ca.1:1) with good recyclability.The as-designed Co(OH) 2 /H 2 Ti 6 O 13 composite could be recognized as a promising candidate for the future green photoconversion of CO 2 to solve environmental and energy problems.Moreover, this work proposes an enforceable approach to controllably synthesize different H 2 / CO mixtures for industrial applications. s Supporting Information The Supporting Information is available free of charge at https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsami.1c08251.

Figure 1a schematically illustrates the preparation of a Co(OH) 2 /H 2 Ti 6 O 13 hybrid composite, which is realized by assembling Co(OH) 2 nanoparticles onto exfoliated H 2 Ti 6 O 13 nanosheets through a facile hydrothermal treatment.The ultrathin H 2 Ti 6 O 13 used in the synthesis is prepared by liquid exfoliation, as shown in Figures S1-S4.After decoration of Co(OH) 2 , XRD analysis is first performed to analyze the phase components of the Co(OH) 2 /H 2 Ti 6 O 13 composites with different weight contents of Co(OH) 2 .As presented in Figure 1b, all of the Co(OH) 2 /H 2 Ti 6 O 13 composites display similar XRD patterns to those of bare H 2 Ti 6 O 13 , indicating the retention of the crystal structure of H 2 Ti 6 O 13 by the hydrothermal treatment.No characteristic peak of Co(OH) 2 is observed.This can be ascribed to the following factors: (i) the weight content of Co(OH) 2 is low and (ii) the loaded Co(OH) 2 is highly dispersed on the H 2 Ti 6 O 13 nanosheets. Figure 1c,d displays the SEM images of the bare H 2 Ti 6 O 13 and the hybrid Co(OH) 2 /H 2 Ti 6 O 13 , which reveal the microstructure information of the samples.It can be seen that the prepared Co(OH) 2 /H 2 Ti 6 O 13 presents a nanosheet morphology as that of bare H 2 Ti 6 O 13 without obvious aggregation, indicating the preservation of the H 2 Ti 6 O 13 morphological characteristics after the hydrothermal process.The well-maintained ultrathin nanosheet is favorable to fulfill the catalytic function of the material.Figure 2a-c presents the TEM images of the bare H 2 Ti 6 O 13 and the hybrid Co(OH) 2 / H 2 Ti 6 O 13 , which provide further microstructure and morphology information of the catalysts.Both of the samples display 2D structures with nearly transparent features, denoting the ultrathin nature (Figure 2a,b) of the nanosheets.Notably, in comparison with the smooth surface of the bare H 2 Ti 6 O 13 , some particles are observed on the nanosheet surface of Co(OH) 2 /H 2 Ti 6 O 13 .High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) analysis of the nanoparticles reveals lattice fringes of 0.23 nm (Figure 2c), which are well consistent with the (001) facets of Co(OH) 2 . 36Concurrently, clear lattice fringes of 0.32 nm are observed for the nanosheet substrate, which matches with the interplane spacing of the (130) plane of H 2 Ti 6 O 13 .Besides, the energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) elemental mapping of Co-(OH) 2 /H 2 Ti 6 O 13 (Figure 2d) discloses notable cobalt species distributed on the H 2 Ti 6 O 13 nanosheets.These findings Figure 2.
