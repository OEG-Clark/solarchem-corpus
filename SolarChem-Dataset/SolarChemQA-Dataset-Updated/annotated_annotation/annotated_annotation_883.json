as-prepared BiOF appear at 14.2, 27.8, 28.7, 33.8, 37.5, respectively, which is consistent with the tetragonal phase BiOF (JCPDS No. 73-1595) 21.The characteristic diffraction peaks of as-formed BiOCl appear at 12.0, 25.9, 32.5, 33.4, 40.9, corresponding to (001), ( 101), ( 110), ( 102), (112) lattice plane, respectively, which is coincide with the tetragonal phase BiOCl (JCPDS No. 06-0249) 22.The XRD peaks of as-prepared BiOBr are located at 10.9, 25.2, 31.7,32.2, and 57.1, corresponding to (001), ( 101), ( 102), ( 110) and (212) crystal faces of BiOBr (JCPDS No. 09-0393) 23, respectively.The diffraction peaks of as-synthesized BiOI at 9.7, 29.6, 31.7,45.4, 55.2correspond to the (001), ( 102), ( 110), ( 200), (212) crystal planes of tetragonal phase BiOI (JCPDS No. 10-0445) 24.In addition, no impurity peak is observed, demonstrating that the obtained sample is pure BiOX.Scheme 1 shows the schematic diagram of the crystal structure of BiOX 25. The SEM image of BiOF in Fig. 2a demonstrates that BiOF is nanosheet structure, which is further illustrated by the TEM image in Fig. 2b.The (002) plane of BiOF corresponds to the crystal diameter of 0.30 nm presented in Fig. 2c.As shown in Fig. 2d ande, the as-prepared BiOCl exhibits flower-like microsphere structure comprising of nanosheets with thickness of 15-40 nm, and the lattice stripe of 0.26 nm belongs to the (102) plane of BiOCl (Fig. 2f).It can be observed from Fig. 2g and h that the morphology of BiOBr is similar to that of BiOCl.The lattice spacing of 0.34 nm in Fig. 2i can be indexed as the (101) plane of BiOBr.From Fig. 2j andk, it is clear that the as-synthesized BiOI is made up of nanosheets, which is similar to that of BiOF.HRTEM image (Fig. 2I) gives a lattice stripe of 0.30 nm, corresponding to the (102) crystal plane of BiOI.In addition, the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of BiOI (Fig. 2l inset) is presented in the form of diffraction spots, indicating that it is single crystal structure 23.It is worth noting that the as-prepared BiOX except BiOI is polycrystalline structure due to the diffraction ring of SAED pattern, which are displayed in Fig. 2c, f and i respectively.EDX element mapping of Bi, O, and X for BiOX is manifested in Fig. S1, indicating that the elements of Bi, O, and X uniformly distribute in BiOX.The Bi/X atomic percentage obtained by the EDX (Fig. S2) approximates to 1, demonstrating the synthesized BiOX with stoichiometric ratio. High resolution XPS spectra of Bi, O and corresponding X for BiOX are exhibited in Fig. 3.The characteristic peak of F 1s in Fig. 3a1 is located at 683.9 eV, which corresponds to the F -ions in BiOF 21.In Fig. 3a2, the peaks at 197.9 eV and 199.5 eV are related to Cl 2p 3/2 and Cl 2p 1/2 22, respectively.As can be seen from Fig. 3a3, the peak of Br 3d is deconvolved into two peaks at 68.3 eV and 69.4 eV, which can be classified as Br - 26.The two peaks at 619.3 eV and 630.7 eV in Fig. 3a4 are assigned to I 3d 5/2 and I 3d 3/2 27, respectively.The Bi 4f spectrum of BiOF in Fig. 3b1 displays a pair of peaks at 159.4 eV and 164.8 eV, corresponding to Bi 4f 7/2 and Bi 4f 5/ are associated with Bi 3 -O, oxygen vacancies (OVs) and adsorbed oxygen in Fig. 3 c1 2, respectively.This phenomenon is also confirmed by BiOCl, BiOBr and BiOI, as illustrated in Fig. 3c2, c3 and c4, respectively, indicating that there are some OVs in the as-prepared BiOX. Fig. 4 shows the Raman spectra of BiOX.The vibration band of 170 cm -1 in BiOF is related to the stretching mode of A1g internal Bi-F 28.As the X atom number increases, the Bi-X active vibration band in BiOX gradually moves toward the low wavenumber direction.The vibration band of 200 cm -1 in BiOCl is classified into the E g internal Bi-Cl stretching mode 29.The vibration band at 69 cm -1 in BiOX is characteristic vibration band of OVs, which is consistent with the XPS results 23. The photocatalytic activity of sample was evaluated by the reaction of CO 2 with H 2 O under a simulated solar light source.Fig. 5a shows the photocatalytic product distribution on BiOX under illumination.Except CO and CH 4 , none of other products were detected, and the yield of CO is significantly higher than that of CH 4 , indicating that CO is the major product.When the reaction was conducted in (Ar H 2 O) rather than (CO 2 H 2 O) atmosphere, almost no any reduction product is detected (Fig. S3), demonstrating that the filled CO 2 is indeed the source of CO 30.The ability of BiOX to convert CO 2 to CO increases first and then decreases as the number of X atoms increases.No CO was detected when the CO 2 catalytic reduction system is in the dark state, suggesting that light is a necessary condition for the reduction of CO 2 30,31.The BiOBr catalyst showed CO evolution as high as 21.6 mol g -1 h -1 during 3 h, and the reaction activity keeps stable during 12 h (Fig. S4).It can be seen that with increasing light intensity, the product CO evolution is linearly increased, while the product CH 4 evolution in linearly increased and then decreased rapidly.This shows that the reduction to CO is an apparent first-order reaction versus light intensity, which implies there is a rate-determining step with one electron in the overall reduction half reaction needing 2 electrons and 2 protons (CO 2 2e- 2H CO H 2 O) 31,32.As for the reduction to minor product CH 4 , it is also first-order reaction versus light intensity under low intensity illumination.Therefore it has also a rate-determining step with one electron.This suggests that the reduction to CO and the reduction to CH 4 may be a pair of parallel reactions and their rate-determining step occurs on the same sites of BiOX photocatalyst and competes for photogenerated electrons.However, the latter, which involves 8 electrons and 8 protons (CO 2 8e- 8H CH 4 2H 2 O), undergoes more reaction steps than the former only involving 2 electrons and 2 protons, and the product CO shows higher selectivity than the product CH 4 .In low light intensity, two reduction processes take place by their respective selectivity.The decrease in the CH 4 yield in high light intensity could be related with the increase in the reaction temperature induced by the strong illumination, which leads to the decrease of water adsorption and therefore inhibition for the subsequent reduction of the Intermediate species to CH 4 , which was supported by effect of water dosage on the reaction products (Fig. S6).The photocatalytic reduction yield of CO 2 to CO is almost unaffected by H 2 O (Fig. S6), while the reduction yield to CH 4 shows the maximum value in the dosage of 10 L water, in which both low and high water dosage are unfavorable for the reduction to CH 4 .The average apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) and solar conversion efficiency (SCE) were estimated by the results in Fig. 5b.The AQE is ca.1.26,and the SCE is ca.1.86 for the reaction 33.According to the yields of CO and CH 4 , it could be obtained that the yield of O 2 is ca.10.8 mol g -1 h -1 and 2.4 mol g -1 h -1 , respectively, which is close to the measured O 2 evolution amount (11.8 mol g -1 h -1 ), indicating that the reduction of CO 2 to CO and CH 4 occurs along with the oxidation of H 2 O to O 2 .The results of the isotope experiments performed in CO 2 and H 2 18 O is manifested in Fig. 5c.There are 16 O 2 (m/z 32), 16 O 18 O (m/z 34) and 18 O 2 (m/z 36) peaks in Fig. 5c and the relative abundance of 16 O 18 O is much higher than that of 16 O 2 and 18 O 2 .Since the photogenerated hole could oxidize H 2 18 O to form 18 O 2 and hydrogen protons.Then, CO 2 combines with a hydrogen proton and an electron to produce H 2 16 O 34, which could be further oxidized by hole to release 16 O 2 .Therefore, rapid oxygen isotope exchange equilibrium between 16 O 2 and 18 O 2 will result in a higher relative abundance of 16 O 18 O 35,36. Fig. 6a depicts the N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherm of BiOX with a type IV hysteresis loop, indicating the presence of mesoporous structures 27.The specific surface areas of BiOF, BiOCl, BiOBr, BiOI are 8.8, 30.1, 9.1 and 3.4 m 2 g -1 , respectively.The maximum CO 2 adsorption capacities of BiOF, BiOCl, BiOBr and BiOI at room temperature are 0.4, 0.3, 0.1 and 0.05 m 2 g -1 , respectively, as shown in Fig. 6b.No obvious correlation between the specific surface area and CO 2 adsorption capacity of BiOX is observed 37. It can be seen from Fig. 7a that BiOF and BiOCl can only harvest ultraviolet light, but BiOBr and BiOI can respond to visible light.Then, the band gaps of BiOX in Fig. 7b are estimated by the formula of ahv A(hv -E g ) n/2 .Among them, a, h, v, A and E g separately represent the photo-absorption coefficient, Planck constant, light frequency, a constant and the band gap 38.The value of n is 4 owing to the indirect transition of BiOX 20.The band position of BiOX are exhibited in Fig. 7d as the conduction band (CB) potential of n-type semiconductor with positive Mott-Scotty slope is approximate the flat band potential (Fig. 7c) 39.The valence band (VB) potential of BiOX can be estimated by E vb E cb E g .The Nyquist plots of BiOX in Fig. 7e reveal that photogenerated carrier separation of BiOBr has less electric resistance because of its small impedance radius 26.The PL spectra, in Fig. 7f, show the lower intensity of BiOBr and BiOI respectively, demonstrating that strong light absorption cannot be directly involved in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.However, strong light absorption can produce a strong photothermal effect to promote the generation and transfer of photogenerated carriers 30,40,41.Consequently, BiOBr and BiOI with strong photothermal effect owing to their efficient visible light absorption, which can speed up the separation of photogenerated carriers 22.The characteristic vibration band of 2336 cm -1 is related to the asymmetric stretching of CO 2 v as (CO 2 ), and the peak intensity is gradually weakened with the extension of illumination time 42.The characteristic vibration band of 1480 cm -1 is the characteristic vibration band of monodentate adsorption of CO 2 (m-CO 2 ).The vibration band at 1280 cm -1 , 1363 cm -1 , 1549 cm -1 and 1706 cm -1 belonging to the bidentate adsorption of CO 2 (b-CO 2 ) 43,44.The vibration bands of 1312 cm -1 , 1597 cm -1 , 2862 cm -1 and 2941 cm -1 belong to carboxyl species (COOH).The bands intensity at 1312 cm -1 , 1597 cm -1 are gradually increase and the band intensity at 2862 cm -1 , 2941 cm -1 are gradually decreases, indicating that COOH group is the crucial intermediate product during CO 2 reduction to CO and CH 4 434445. Fig. 9a shows the variation in ESR spectra of BiOF in air/CO 2 with or without simulated sunlight illumination.The characteristic ESR signal of OVs is observed in the air, which is enhanced under the illumination conditions 46.However, the characteristic ESR signal of OVs disappeared or weakened in CO 2 atmosphere, which suggests that the adsorption of CO 2 is in the position of oxygen vacancies of BiOF 47.The OVs signal in CO 2 atmosphere is enhanced in the lighting environment, inferring that the concentration of OVs increases after the light irradiation 47,48.The ESR spectra of BiOCl, BiOBr, and BiOI showed similar trends, as shown in Fig. 9b, c andd respectively. The PAL spectra and PAL parameters of BiOX is shown in Fig. 10 and Table1, respectively.The 1 component of 173.5 ps with 46.40 strength can be classified as OVs of BiOF 21, which is consistent with the XPS and ESR results 49.The intensity of OVs is 53.06, 54.10, 50.70 for BiOCl, BiOBr and BiOI, respectively. 2 component is caused by large defect clusters capturing positrons 50.The average electron density of large defect clusters is lower than that of small defect clusters, thus CO 2 is preferentially adsorbed at the OVs 51.The concentration of OVs of BiOBr is the highest among BiOX (X F, Cl, Br, I) according the PAL results, which exhibits the best CO 2 photoreduction activity among the BiOX family. Fig. 11 presents the electronic band structure of pure BiOX and BiOX-OVs.The maximum value of VB is set at a position where the energy is zero.It can be seen from the electronic band structure of BiOX that the conduction band minimum (CBM) is at the Z point and the valence band maximum (VBM) is at the ZeR connection, validating that BiOX is indirect semiconductor 19,20.The band gaps of BiOX decrease in turn with the increase of X atom number.A new impurity band appears in BiOX-OVs compared with pure BiOX, which is close to CBM for pure BiOX (XF, Cl, Br) and for BiOI is close to VBM.In addition, the VBM of BiOX-OVs performed more gradual than pure BiOX, verifying that the photogenerated carriers on BiOX-OVs have better separation efficiency due to the holes on VBM with a greater effective mass in the presence of OVs 50.Additionally, the presence of OVs increases the hybridization degree between the individual atomic orbitals in BiOX, resulting in the electronic band structure more intensive 52.Both VBM and CBM of BiOX-OVs are located at different high symmetry points in K space, indicating that the presence of OVs does not change the type of band gap transition.Correspondingly, the band gap of BiOX has a slight change in the condition of OVs, which is consistent with the report by Di, Fu et al. 41,53,54. The density of state (DOS) distributions of BiOX and BiOX-OVs are displayed in Fig. 12.The DOS peak of F-2s in BiOF is located at -21.0 to -19.6 eV, and the energy of X-ns band in BiOX gradually increases as the X atomic number increases.The band of O-2s centered at -18.0 to -14.0 eV and the band of Bi-6s is located at -11.0 to -7.0 eV in BiOX.It is worth noting that the band of X-ns is over the band of O-2s in BiOX (X Cl, Br, I) and the F-2s band is below the O-2s band in BiOF.Additionally, the I-5s band overlaps with the Bi-6s band in BiOI.Therefore, the distance between X-ns band and Bi-6s band is shortening as the X atomic number increases.The bands of O-2p and X-np mainly contribute to the VB, and the band of Bi-6p mainly contributes to the CB 19.Not only the new DOS band but also the increased DOS is observed in BiOX-OVs compared with BiOX, which proves that the introduction of OVs can generate more photogenerated carriers 39,46,55. Fig. 13 shows the electron density distribution of BiOX and BiOX-OVs.The electron density around the O in BiOX (X Cl, Br, I) is greater than that around Bi and X, but the electron density around F atom in BiOF is greater than that around Bi and O.The presence of OVs in BiOX might cause lattice distortion, which may redistribute the charge 56.In BiOX-OVs (X Cl, Br, I), the atom of O can capture electrons from Bi or X due to its strong electronegativity, which results in the electron density of O atoms increasing.While, it is worth noting that F can capture electrons on Bi or O due to the strong electronegativity of F in BiOF 57.Electron transfer energy can be reduced due to the reduced electronegativity with increasing atomic number of X.However, electron transfer energy could be increased with the ion radius raising 58.Therefore, the electron density of O for BiOBr is the highest among BiOX (X F, Cl, Br, I), which exhibits the best CO 2 photoreduction activity among the BiOX family. Combined the above experimental results with DFT calculation, the possible OVs mediated mechanism of BiOX for CO 2 photoreduction is proposed in Scheme2, taking bromine as an example.Formula 1 shows the surface structure with OVs for BiOBr catalyst.Firstly, oxygen atom in CO 2 molecule is adsorbed on the OVs and turn into lattice oxygen in the process of CO 2 photoreduction (2) 59.Formula 2 and 2' show the two equilibrium states of monodentate and bidentate adsorption of CO 2 respectively 60.The oxygen inserted into the lattice with strong electronegativity induces the charge shift of Bi-O bond 23.Therefore, the adjacent lattice oxygen with lower charge density is apt to be oxidized to OVs by two photogenerated holes (2h ) 61.That is to say, another OVs with two positive charges could be generated under the light illumination (3).The formula 3 with the structure of monodentate adsorption of CO 2 is the equilibrium state of formula 3' with the structure of bidentate adsorption of CO 2 .Oxygen atom in H 2 O molecule fills the OVs and produces two hydrogen protons (4) 61.The formula 4 or 4' gets an electron and a hydrogen proton to produce 5 or 5', in which 4 and 4', 5 and 5' are also two equilibrium states respectively.At last, the formula 5 also obtains one electron and one hydrogen proton to produce H 2 O and CO molecules and back to the initial state of the catalyst of 1 (blue flow line) 61.After that, the formula 5' gets one electron and one hydrogen proton to produce 6' with the hemiacetal adsorption states 62.Correspondingly, another OVs in formula 7' is formed under the irradiation of simulated sunlight due to the charge shift of Bi-O bond.Similarly, oxygen atom in H 2 O molecule fills the OVs and produces two hydrogen protons (8').Then, the formula 8' gets one electron and one hydrogen proton to produce 9' with the hemiacetal adsorption states 62.Finally, the formula 9' releases CH 4 and O 2 molecules and back to the initial state of the catalyst of 1 (green flow line). Recently, it is reported that the formation of COOH group is the rate limiting step for CO 2 reduction to CO or CH 4 because the formation energy of COOH is very high 60.Therefore, the higher light intensity is beneficial to the formation of COOH intermediate, further proving the forming of 5 is the rate limiting step for CO 2 reduction.According to the DFT calculation, OVs on defective surface could serve as active sites and enormously lower the barrier of the formation of COOH 63.The intensity of ESR peak in the irradiation of simulated sunlight is much higher than that under the irradiation of visible light ( 420 nm), indicating that the simulated sunlight irradiation could induce more photogenerated hole to oxidize lattice oxygen to generate OVs (Fig. S7a,b) 64, which play key roles of CO 2 photoreduction (step 3 and 7') 31,47,61.Furthermore, BiOBr exhibited much higher CO 2 photoreduction activity under the irradiation of simulated sunlight than that of visible light, further proving the UV light could induce more OVs and facilitate the generation of CO and H 2 O for BiOBr (Fig. S7c).Simultaneously, BiOBr with the irradiation of higher light intensity exhibits the almost 100 selectivity of the CO product, illustrating that the CO 2 photoreduction mechanism under the irradiation of higher light intensity is shown as the blue flow line.It was found that the key intermediate of 5' on the surface of BiOBr further combines with electrons and hydrogen protons to further produce CH 4 (green flow line).It is favorable to forming formula 5 instead of 5' under the irradiation of the high light intensity.Therefore, the products of CO 2 reduction are only CO and H 2 O without CH 4 at high light intensity.The reaction equations under the irradiation of simulated sunlight with high light intensity and low light intensity were shown in Fig. S8, respectively. In addition, according to the above results of DFT calculation, it could be speculated that the photogenerated carriers on BiOX with OVs have better separation efficiency owing to the more gradual band structure.The increased density of states induced by OVs for BiOX indicated the OVs could generate more photogenerated carriers.Furthermore, the presence of OVs could result in lattice distortion and redistribute charge.BiOBr exhibited the most excellent photocatalytic activity for CO 2 photoreduction among BiOX (X F, Cl, Br, I), which could be attributed to the appropriate atomic number, ion radius, electron density for Br and modest band gap, which could exhibit strong photocatalytic and thermal catalytic effects 40."}, {"llm generation": "BiOX", "source": "This suggests that the reduction to CO and the reduction to CH 4 may be a pair of parallel reactions and their rate-determining step occurs on the same sites of BiOX photocatalyst and competes for photogenerated electrons.", "context": "Fig. 1 displays the XRD patterns of the as-synthesized BiOX samples.The (001), (101), (002), (110), (102) crystal planes of as-prepared BiOF appear at 14.2, 27.8, 28.7, 33.8, 37.5, respectively, which is consistent with the tetragonal phase BiOF (JCPDS No. 73-1595) 21.The characteristic diffraction peaks of as-formed BiOCl appear at 12.0, 25.9, 32.5, 33.4, 40.9, corresponding to (001), ( 101), ( 110), ( 102), (112) lattice plane, respectively, which is coincide with the tetragonal phase BiOCl (JCPDS No. 06-0249) 22.The XRD peaks of as-prepared BiOBr are located at 10.9, 25.2, 31.7,32.2, and 57.1, corresponding to (001), ( 101), ( 102), ( 110) and (212) crystal faces of BiOBr (JCPDS No. 09-0393) 23, respectively.The diffraction peaks of as-synthesized BiOI at 9.7, 29.6, 31.7,45.4, 55.2correspond to the (001), ( 102), ( 110), ( 200), (212) crystal planes of tetragonal phase BiOI (JCPDS No. 10-0445) 24.In addition, no impurity peak is observed, demonstrating that the obtained sample is pure BiOX.Scheme 1 shows the schematic diagram of the crystal structure of BiOX 25.

The photocatalytic activity of sample was evaluated by the reaction of CO 2 with H 2 O under a simulated solar light source.Fig. 5a shows the photocatalytic product distribution on BiOX under illumination.Except CO and CH 4 , none of other products were detected, and the yield of CO is significantly higher than that of CH 4 , indicating that CO is the major product.When the reaction was conducted in (Ar H 2 O) rather than (CO 2 H 2 O) atmosphere, almost no any reduction product is detected (Fig. S3), demonstrating that the filled CO 2 is indeed the source of CO 30.The ability of BiOX to convert CO 2 to CO increases first and then decreases as the number of X atoms increases.No CO was detected when the CO 2 catalytic reduction system is in the dark state, suggesting that light is a necessary condition for the reduction of CO 2 30,31.The BiOBr catalyst showed CO evolution as high as 21.6 mol g -1 h -1 during 3 h, and the reaction activity keeps stable during 12 h (Fig. S4).It can be seen that with increasing light intensity, the product CO evolution is linearly increased, while the product CH 4 evolution in linearly increased and then decreased rapidly.This shows that the reduction to CO is an apparent first-order reaction versus light intensity, which implies there is a rate-determining step with one electron in the overall reduction half reaction needing 2 electrons and 2 protons (CO 2 2e- 2H CO H 2 O) 31,32.As for the reduction to minor product CH 4 , it is also first-order reaction versus light intensity under low intensity illumination.Therefore it has also a rate-determining step with one electron.This suggests that the reduction to CO and the reduction to CH 4 may be a pair of parallel reactions and their rate-determining step occurs on the same sites of BiOX photocatalyst and competes for photogenerated electrons.However, the latter, which involves 8 electrons and 8 protons (CO 2 8e- 8H CH 4 2H 2 O), undergoes more reaction steps than the former only involving 2 electrons and 2 protons, and the product CO shows higher selectivity than the product CH 4 .In low light intensity, two reduction processes take place by their respective selectivity.The decrease in the CH 4 yield in high light intensity could be related with the increase in the reaction temperature induced by the strong illumination, which leads to the decrease of water adsorption and therefore inhibition for the subsequent reduction of the Intermediate species to CH 4 , which was supported by effect of water dosage on the reaction products (Fig. S6).The photocatalytic reduction yield of CO 2 to CO is almost unaffected by H 2 O (Fig. S6), while the reduction yield to CH 4 shows the maximum value in the dosage of 10 L water, in which both low and high water dosage are unfavorable for the reduction to CH 4 .The average apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) and solar conversion efficiency (SCE) were estimated by the results in Fig. 5b.The AQE is ca.1.26,and the SCE is ca.1.86 for the reaction 33.According to the yields of CO and CH 4 , it could be obtained that the yield of O 2 is ca.10.8 mol g -1 h -1 and 2.4 mol g -1 h -1 , respectively, which is close to the measured O 2 evolution amount (11.8 mol g -1 h -1 ), indicating that the reduction of CO 2 to CO and CH 4 occurs along with the oxidation of H 2 O to O 2 .The results of the isotope experiments performed in CO 2 and H 2 18 O is manifested in Fig. 5c.There are 16 O 2 (m/z 32), 16 O 18 O (m/z 34) and 18 O 2 (m/z 36) peaks in Fig. 5c and the relative abundance of 16 O 18 O is much higher than that of 16 O 2 and 18 O 2 .Since the photogenerated hole could oxidize H 2 18 O to form 18 O 2 and hydrogen protons.Then, CO 2 combines with a hydrogen proton and an electron to produce H 2 16 O 34, which could be further oxidized by hole to release 16 O 2 .Therefore, rapid oxygen isotope exchange equilibrium between 16 O 2 and 18 O 2 will result in a higher relative abundance of 16 O 18 O 35,36. Fig. 6a depicts the N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherm of BiOX with a type IV hysteresis loop, indicating the presence of mesoporous structures 27.The specific surface areas of BiOF, BiOCl, BiOBr, BiOI are 8.8, 30.1, 9.1 and 3.4 m 2 g -1 , respectively.The maximum CO 2 adsorption capacities of BiOF, BiOCl, BiOBr and BiOI at room temperature are 0.4, 0.3, 0.1 and 0.05 m 2 g -1 , respectively, as shown in Fig. 6b.No obvious correlation between the specific surface area and CO 2 adsorption capacity of BiOX is observed 37. It can be seen from Fig. 7a that BiOF and BiOCl can only harvest ultraviolet light, but BiOBr and BiOI can respond to visible light.Then, the band gaps of BiOX in Fig. 7b are estimated by the formula of ahv A(hv -E g ) n/2 .Among them, a, h, v, A and E g separately represent the photo-absorption coefficient, Planck constant, light frequency, a constant and the band gap 38.The value of n is 4 owing to the indirect transition of BiOX 20.The band position of BiOX are exhibited in Fig. 7d as the conduction band (CB) potential of n-type semiconductor with positive Mott-Scotty slope is approximate the flat band potential (Fig. 7c) 39.The valence band (VB) potential of BiOX can be estimated by E vb E cb E g .The Nyquist plots of BiOX in Fig. 7e reveal that photogenerated carrier separation of BiOBr has less electric resistance because of its small impedance radius 26.The PL spectra, in Fig. 7f, show the lower intensity of BiOBr and BiOI respectively, demonstrating that strong light absorption cannot be directly involved in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.However, strong light absorption can produce a strong photothermal effect to promote the generation and transfer of photogenerated carriers 30,40,41.Consequently, BiOBr and BiOI with strong photothermal effect owing to their efficient visible light absorption, which can speed up the separation of photogenerated carriers 22.The characteristic vibration band of 2336 cm -1 is related to the asymmetric stretching of CO 2 v as (CO 2 ), and the peak intensity is gradually weakened with the extension of illumination time 42.The characteristic vibration band of 1480 cm -1 is the characteristic vibration band of monodentate adsorption of CO 2 (m-CO 2 ).The vibration band at 1280 cm -1 , 1363 cm -1 , 1549 cm -1 and 1706 cm -1 belonging to the bidentate adsorption of CO 2 (b-CO 2 ) 43,44.The vibration bands of 1312 cm -1 , 1597 cm -1 , 2862 cm -1 and 2941 cm -1 belong to carboxyl species (COOH).The bands intensity at 1312 cm -1 , 1597 cm -1 are gradually increase and the band intensity at 2862 cm -1 , 2941 cm -1 are gradually decreases, indicating that COOH group is the crucial intermediate product during CO 2 reduction to CO and CH 4 434445. Fig. 9a shows the variation in ESR spectra of BiOF in air/CO 2 with or without simulated sunlight illumination.The characteristic ESR signal of OVs is observed in the air, which is enhanced under the illumination conditions 46.However, the characteristic ESR signal of OVs disappeared or weakened in CO 2 atmosphere, which suggests that the adsorption of CO 2 is in the position of oxygen vacancies of BiOF 47.The OVs signal in CO 2 atmosphere is enhanced in the lighting environment, inferring that the concentration of OVs increases after the light irradiation 47,48.The ESR spectra of BiOCl, BiOBr, and BiOI showed similar trends, as shown in Fig. 9b, c andd respectively. The PAL spectra and PAL parameters of BiOX is shown in Fig. 10 and Table1, respectively.The 1 component of 173.5 ps with 46.40 strength can be classified as OVs of BiOF 21, which is consistent with the XPS and ESR results 49.The intensity of OVs is 53.06, 54.10, 50.70 for BiOCl, BiOBr and BiOI, respectively. 2 component is caused by large defect clusters capturing positrons 50.The average electron density of large defect clusters is lower than that of small defect clusters, thus CO 2 is preferentially adsorbed at the OVs 51.The concentration of OVs of BiOBr is the highest among BiOX (X F, Cl, Br, I) according the PAL results, which exhibits the best CO 2 photoreduction activity among the BiOX family. Fig. 11 presents the electronic band structure of pure BiOX and BiOX-OVs.The maximum value of VB is set at a position where the energy is zero.It can be seen from the electronic band structure of BiOX that the conduction band minimum (CBM) is at the Z point and the valence band maximum (VBM) is at the ZeR connection, validating that BiOX is indirect semiconductor 19,20.The band gaps of BiOX decrease in turn with the increase of X atom number.A new impurity band appears in BiOX-OVs compared with pure BiOX, which is close to CBM for pure BiOX (XF, Cl, Br) and for BiOI is close to VBM.In addition, the VBM of BiOX-OVs performed more gradual than pure BiOX, verifying that the photogenerated carriers on BiOX-OVs have better separation efficiency due to the holes on VBM with a greater effective mass in the presence of OVs 50.Additionally, the presence of OVs increases the hybridization degree between the individual atomic orbitals in BiOX, resulting in the electronic band structure more intensive 52.Both VBM and CBM of BiOX-OVs are located at different high symmetry points in K space, indicating that the presence of OVs does not change the type of band gap transition.Correspondingly, the band gap of BiOX has a slight change in the condition of OVs, which is consistent with the report by Di, Fu et al. 41,53,54. The density of state (DOS) distributions of BiOX and BiOX-OVs are displayed in Fig. 12.The DOS peak of F-2s in BiOF is located at -21.0 to -19.6 eV, and the energy of X-ns band in BiOX gradually increases as the X atomic number increases.The band of O-2s centered at -18.0 to -14.0 eV and the band of Bi-6s is located at -11.0 to -7.0 eV in BiOX.It is worth noting that the band of X-ns is over the band of O-2s in BiOX (X Cl, Br, I) and the F-2s band is below the O-2s band in BiOF.Additionally, the I-5s band overlaps with the Bi-6s band in BiOI.Therefore, the distance between X-ns band and Bi-6s band is shortening as the X atomic number increases.The bands of O-2p and X-np mainly contribute to the VB, and the band of Bi-6p mainly contributes to the CB 19.Not only the new DOS band but also the increased DOS is observed in BiOX-OVs compared with BiOX, which proves that the introduction of OVs can generate more photogenerated carriers 39,46,55. Fig. 13 shows the electron density distribution of BiOX and BiOX-OVs.The electron density around the O in BiOX (X Cl, Br, I) is greater than that around Bi and X, but the electron density around F atom in BiOF is greater than that around Bi and O.The presence of OVs in BiOX might cause lattice distortion, which may redistribute the charge 56.In BiOX-OVs (X Cl, Br, I), the atom of O can capture electrons from Bi or X due to its strong electronegativity, which results in the electron density of O atoms increasing.While, it is worth noting that F can capture electrons on Bi or O due to the strong electronegativity of F in BiOF 57.Electron transfer energy can be reduced due to the reduced electronegativity with increasing atomic number of X.However, electron transfer energy could be increased with the ion radius raising 58.Therefore, the electron density of O for BiOBr is the highest among BiOX (X F, Cl, Br, I), which exhibits the best CO 2 photoreduction activity among the BiOX family. Combined the above experimental results with DFT calculation, the possible OVs mediated mechanism of BiOX for CO 2 photoreduction is proposed in Scheme2, taking bromine as an example.Formula 1 shows the surface structure with OVs for BiOBr catalyst.Firstly, oxygen atom in CO 2 molecule is adsorbed on the OVs and turn into lattice oxygen in the process of CO 2 photoreduction (2) 59.Formula 2 and 2' show the two equilibrium states of monodentate and bidentate adsorption of CO 2 respectively 60.The oxygen inserted into the lattice with strong electronegativity induces the charge shift of Bi-O bond 23.Therefore, the adjacent lattice oxygen with lower charge density is apt to be oxidized to OVs by two photogenerated holes (2h ) 61.That is to say, another OVs with two positive charges could be generated under the light illumination (3).The formula 3 with the structure of monodentate adsorption of CO 2 is the equilibrium state of formula 3' with the structure of bidentate adsorption of CO 2 .Oxygen atom in H 2 O molecule fills the OVs and produces two hydrogen protons (4) 61.The formula 4 or 4' gets an electron and a hydrogen proton to produce 5 or 5', in which 4 and 4', 5 and 5' are also two equilibrium states respectively.At last, the formula 5 also obtains one electron and one hydrogen proton to produce H 2 O and CO molecules and back to the initial state of the catalyst of 1 (blue flow line) 61.After that, the formula 5' gets one electron and one hydrogen proton to produce 6' with the hemiacetal adsorption states 62.Correspondingly, another OVs in formula 7' is formed under the irradiation of simulated sunlight due to the charge shift of Bi-O bond.Similarly, oxygen atom in H 2 O molecule fills the OVs and produces two hydrogen protons (8').Then, the formula 8' gets one electron and one hydrogen proton to produce 9' with the hemiacetal adsorption states 62.Finally, the formula 9' releases CH 4 and O 2 molecules and back to the initial state of the catalyst of 1 (green flow line). Recently, it is reported that the formation of COOH group is the rate limiting step for CO 2 reduction to CO or CH 4 because the formation energy of COOH is very high 60.Therefore, the higher light intensity is beneficial to the formation of COOH intermediate, further proving the forming of 5 is the rate limiting step for CO 2 reduction.According to the DFT calculation, OVs on defective surface could serve as active sites and enormously lower the barrier of the formation of COOH 63.The intensity of ESR peak in the irradiation of simulated sunlight is much higher than that under the irradiation of visible light ( 420 nm), indicating that the simulated sunlight irradiation could induce more photogenerated hole to oxidize lattice oxygen to generate OVs (Fig. S7a,b) 64, which play key roles of CO 2 photoreduction (step 3 and 7') 31,47,61.Furthermore, BiOBr exhibited much higher CO 2 photoreduction activity under the irradiation of simulated sunlight than that of visible light, further proving the UV light could induce more OVs and facilitate the generation of CO and H 2 O for BiOBr (Fig. S7c).Simultaneously, BiOBr with the irradiation of higher light intensity exhibits the almost 100 selectivity of the CO product, illustrating that the CO 2 photoreduction mechanism under the irradiation of higher light intensity is shown as the blue flow line.It was found that the key intermediate of 5' on the surface of BiOBr further combines with electrons and hydrogen protons to further produce CH 4 (green flow line).It is favorable to forming formula 5 instead of 5' under the irradiation of the high light intensity.Therefore, the products of CO 2 reduction are only CO and H 2 O without CH 4 at high light intensity.The reaction equations under the irradiation of simulated sunlight with high light intensity and low light intensity were shown in Fig. S8, respectively. In addition, according to the above results of DFT calculation, it could be speculated that the photogenerated carriers on BiOX with OVs have better separation efficiency owing to the more gradual band structure.The increased density of states induced by OVs for BiOX indicated the OVs could generate more photogenerated carriers.Furthermore, the presence of OVs could result in lattice distortion and redistribute charge.BiOBr exhibited the most excellent photocatalytic activity for CO 2 photoreduction among BiOX (X F, Cl, Br, I), which could be attributed to the appropriate atomic number, ion radius, electron density for Br and modest band gap, which could exhibit strong photocatalytic and thermal catalytic effects 40."}, {"llm generation": "BiOX", "source": "BiOBr exhibited the most excellent photocatalytic activity for CO 2 photoreduction among BiOX (X F, Cl, Br, I), which could be attributed to the appropriate atomic number, ion radius, electron density for Br and modest band gap, which could exhibit strong photocatalytic and thermal catalytic effects 40.", "context": "Fig. 1 displays the XRD patterns of the as-synthesized BiOX samples.The (001), (101), (002), (110), (102) crystal planes of as-prepared BiOF appear at 14.2, 27.8, 28.7, 33.8, 37.5, respectively, which is consistent with the tetragonal phase BiOF (JCPDS No. 73-1595) 21.The characteristic diffraction peaks of as-formed BiOCl appear at 12.0, 25.9, 32.5, 33.4, 40.9, corresponding to (001), ( 101), ( 110), ( 102), (112) lattice plane, respectively, which is coincide with the tetragonal phase BiOCl (JCPDS No. 06-0249) 22.The XRD peaks of as-prepared BiOBr are located at 10.9, 25.2, 31.7,32.2, and 57.1, corresponding to (001), ( 101), ( 102), ( 110) and (212) crystal faces of BiOBr (JCPDS No. 09-0393) 23, respectively.The diffraction peaks of as-synthesized BiOI at 9.7, 29.6, 31.7,45.4, 55.2correspond to the (001), ( 102), ( 110), ( 200), (212) crystal planes of tetragonal phase BiOI (JCPDS No. 10-0445) 24.In addition, no impurity peak is observed, demonstrating that the obtained sample is pure BiOX.Scheme 1 shows the schematic diagram of the crystal structure of BiOX 25. The SEM image of BiOF in Fig. 2a demonstrates that BiOF is nanosheet structure, which is further illustrated by the TEM image in Fig. 2b.The (002) plane of BiOF corresponds to the crystal diameter of 0.30 nm presented in Fig. 2c.As shown in Fig. 2d ande, the as-prepared BiOCl exhibits flower-like microsphere structure comprising of nanosheets with thickness of 15-40 nm, and the lattice stripe of 0.26 nm belongs to the (102) plane of BiOCl (Fig. 2f).It can be observed from Fig. 2g and h that the morphology of BiOBr is similar to that of BiOCl.The lattice spacing of 0.34 nm in Fig. 2i can be indexed as the (101) plane of BiOBr.From Fig. 2j andk, it is clear that the as-synthesized BiOI is made up of nanosheets, which is similar to that of BiOF.HRTEM image (Fig. 2I) gives a lattice stripe of 0.30 nm, corresponding to the (102) crystal plane of BiOI.In addition, the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of BiOI (Fig. 2l inset) is presented in the form of diffraction spots, indicating that it is single crystal structure 23.It is worth noting that the as-prepared BiOX except BiOI is polycrystalline structure due to the diffraction ring of SAED pattern, which are displayed in Fig. 2c, f and i respectively.EDX element mapping of Bi, O, and X for BiOX is manifested in Fig. S1, indicating that the elements of Bi, O, and X uniformly distribute in BiOX.The Bi/X atomic percentage obtained by the EDX (Fig. S2) approximates to 1, demonstrating the synthesized BiOX with stoichiometric ratio. High resolution XPS spectra of Bi, O and corresponding X for BiOX are exhibited in Fig. 3.The characteristic peak of F 1s in Fig. 3a1 is located at 683.9 eV, which corresponds to the F -ions in BiOF 21.In Fig. 3a2, the peaks at 197.9 eV and 199.5 eV are related to Cl 2p 3/2 and Cl 2p 1/2 22, respectively.As can be seen from Fig. 3a3, the peak of Br 3d is deconvolved into two peaks at 68.3 eV and 69.4 eV, which can be classified as Br - 26.The two peaks at 619.3 eV and 630.7 eV in Fig. 3a4 are assigned to I 3d 5/2 and I 3d 3/2 27, respectively.The Bi 4f spectrum of BiOF in Fig. 3b1 displays a pair of peaks at 159.4 eV and 164.8 eV, corresponding to Bi 4f 7/2 and Bi 4f 5/ are associated with Bi 3 -O, oxygen vacancies (OVs) and adsorbed oxygen in Fig. 3 c1 2, respectively.This phenomenon is also confirmed by BiOCl, BiOBr and BiOI, as illustrated in Fig. 3c2, c3 and c4, respectively, indicating that there are some OVs in the as-prepared BiOX. Fig. 4 shows the Raman spectra of BiOX.The vibration band of 170 cm -1 in BiOF is related to the stretching mode of A1g internal Bi-F 28.As the X atom number increases, the Bi-X active vibration band in BiOX gradually moves toward the low wavenumber direction.The vibration band of 200 cm -1 in BiOCl is classified into the E g internal Bi-Cl stretching mode 29.The vibration band at 69 cm -1 in BiOX is characteristic vibration band of OVs, which is consistent with the XPS results 23. The photocatalytic activity of sample was evaluated by the reaction of CO 2 with H 2 O under a simulated solar light source.Fig. 5a shows the photocatalytic product distribution on BiOX under illumination.Except CO and CH 4 , none of other products were detected, and the yield of CO is significantly higher than that of CH 4 , indicating that CO is the major product.When the reaction was conducted in (Ar H 2 O) rather than (CO 2 H 2 O) atmosphere, almost no any reduction product is detected (Fig. S3), demonstrating that the filled CO 2 is indeed the source of CO 30.The ability of BiOX to convert CO 2 to CO increases first and then decreases as the number of X atoms increases.No CO was detected when the CO 2 catalytic reduction system is in the dark state, suggesting that light is a necessary condition for the reduction of CO 2 30,31.The BiOBr catalyst showed CO evolution as high as 21.6 mol g -1 h -1 during 3 h, and the reaction activity keeps stable during 12 h (Fig. S4).It can be seen that with increasing light intensity, the product CO evolution is linearly increased, while the product CH 4 evolution in linearly increased and then decreased rapidly.This shows that the reduction to CO is an apparent first-order reaction versus light intensity, which implies there is a rate-determining step with one electron in the overall reduction half reaction needing 2 electrons and 2 protons (CO 2 2e- 2H CO H 2 O) 31,32.As for the reduction to minor product CH 4 , it is also first-order reaction versus light intensity under low intensity illumination.Therefore it has also a rate-determining step with one electron.This suggests that the reduction to CO and the reduction to CH 4 may be a pair of parallel reactions and their rate-determining step occurs on the same sites of BiOX photocatalyst and competes for photogenerated electrons.However, the latter, which involves 8 electrons and 8 protons (CO 2 8e- 8H CH 4 2H 2 O), undergoes more reaction steps than the former only involving 2 electrons and 2 protons, and the product CO shows higher selectivity than the product CH 4 .In low light intensity, two reduction processes take place by their respective selectivity.The decrease in the CH 4 yield in high light intensity could be related with the increase in the reaction temperature induced by the strong illumination, which leads to the decrease of water adsorption and therefore inhibition for the subsequent reduction of the Intermediate species to CH 4 , which was supported by effect of water dosage on the reaction products (Fig. S6).The photocatalytic reduction yield of CO 2 to CO is almost unaffected by H 2 O (Fig. S6), while the reduction yield to CH 4 shows the maximum value in the dosage of 10 L water, in which both low and high water dosage are unfavorable for the reduction to CH 4 .The average apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) and solar conversion efficiency (SCE) were estimated by the results in Fig. 5b.The AQE is ca.1.26,and the SCE is ca.1.86 for the reaction 33.According to the yields of CO and CH 4 , it could be obtained that the yield of O 2 is ca.10.8 mol g -1 h -1 and 2.4 mol g -1 h -1 , respectively, which is close to the measured O 2 evolution amount (11.8 mol g -1 h -1 ), indicating that the reduction of CO 2 to CO and CH 4 occurs along with the oxidation of H 2 O to O 2 .The results of the isotope experiments performed in CO 2 and H 2 18 O is manifested in Fig. 5c.There are 16 O 2 (m/z 32), 16 O 18 O (m/z 34) and 18 O 2 (m/z 36) peaks in Fig. 5c and the relative abundance of 16 O 18 O is much higher than that of 16 O 2 and 18 O 2 .Since the photogenerated hole could oxidize H 2 18 O to form 18 O 2 and hydrogen protons.Then, CO 2 combines with a hydrogen proton and an electron to produce H 2 16 O 34, which could be further oxidized by hole to release 16 O 2 .Therefore, rapid oxygen isotope exchange equilibrium between 16 O 2 and 18 O 2 will result in a higher relative abundance of 16 O 18 O 35,36. Fig. 6a depicts the N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherm of BiOX with a type IV hysteresis loop, indicating the presence of mesoporous structures 27.The specific surface areas of BiOF, BiOCl, BiOBr, BiOI are 8.8, 30.1, 9.1 and 3.4 m 2 g -1 , respectively.The maximum CO 2 adsorption capacities of BiOF, BiOCl, BiOBr and BiOI at room temperature are 0.4, 0.3, 0.1 and 0.05 m 2 g -1 , respectively, as shown in Fig. 6b.No obvious correlation between the specific surface area and CO 2 adsorption capacity of BiOX is observed 37. It can be seen from Fig. 7a that BiOF and BiOCl can only harvest ultraviolet light, but BiOBr and BiOI can respond to visible light.Then, the band gaps of BiOX in Fig. 7b are estimated by the formula of ahv A(hv -E g ) n/2 .Among them, a, h, v, A and E g separately represent the photo-absorption coefficient, Planck constant, light frequency, a constant and the band gap 38.The value of n is 4 owing to the indirect transition of BiOX 20.The band position of BiOX are exhibited in Fig. 7d as the conduction band (CB) potential of n-type semiconductor with positive Mott-Scotty slope is approximate the flat band potential (Fig. 7c) 39.The valence band (VB) potential of BiOX can be estimated by E vb E cb E g .The Nyquist plots of BiOX in Fig. 7e reveal that photogenerated carrier separation of BiOBr has less electric resistance because of its small impedance radius 26.The PL spectra, in Fig. 7f, show the lower intensity of BiOBr and BiOI respectively, demonstrating that strong light absorption cannot be directly involved in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.However, strong light absorption can produce a strong photothermal effect to promote the generation and transfer of photogenerated carriers 30,40,41.Consequently, BiOBr and BiOI with strong photothermal effect owing to their efficient visible light absorption, which can speed up the separation of photogenerated carriers 22.The characteristic vibration band of 2336 cm -1 is related to the asymmetric stretching of CO 2 v as (CO 2 ), and the peak intensity is gradually weakened with the extension of illumination time 42.The characteristic vibration band of 1480 cm -1 is the characteristic vibration band of monodentate adsorption of CO 2 (m-CO 2 ).The vibration band at 1280 cm -1 , 1363 cm -1 , 1549 cm -1 and 1706 cm -1 belonging to the bidentate adsorption of CO 2 (b-CO 2 ) 43,44.The vibration bands of 1312 cm -1 , 1597 cm -1 , 2862 cm -1 and 2941 cm -1 belong to carboxyl species (COOH).The bands intensity at 1312 cm -1 , 1597 cm -1 are gradually increase and the band intensity at 2862 cm -1 , 2941 cm -1 are gradually decreases, indicating that COOH group is the crucial intermediate product during CO 2 reduction to CO and CH 4 434445. Fig. 9a shows the variation in ESR spectra of BiOF in air/CO 2 with or without simulated sunlight illumination.The characteristic ESR signal of OVs is observed in the air, which is enhanced under the illumination conditions 46.However, the characteristic ESR signal of OVs disappeared or weakened in CO 2 atmosphere, which suggests that the adsorption of CO 2 is in the position of oxygen vacancies of BiOF 47.The OVs signal in CO 2 atmosphere is enhanced in the lighting environment, inferring that the concentration of OVs increases after the light irradiation 47,48.The ESR spectra of BiOCl, BiOBr, and BiOI showed similar trends, as shown in Fig. 9b, c andd respectively. The PAL spectra and PAL parameters of BiOX is shown in Fig. 10 and Table1, respectively.The 1 component of 173.5 ps with 46.40 strength can be classified as OVs of BiOF 21, which is consistent with the XPS and ESR results 49.The intensity of OVs is 53.06, 54.10, 50.70 for BiOCl, BiOBr and BiOI, respectively. 2 component is caused by large defect clusters capturing positrons 50.The average electron density of large defect clusters is lower than that of small defect clusters, thus CO 2 is preferentially adsorbed at the OVs 51.The concentration of OVs of BiOBr is the highest among BiOX (X F, Cl, Br, I) according the PAL results, which exhibits the best CO 2 photoreduction activity among the BiOX family. Fig. 11 presents the electronic band structure of pure BiOX and BiOX-OVs.The maximum value of VB is set at a position where the energy is zero.It can be seen from the electronic band structure of BiOX that the conduction band minimum (CBM) is at the Z point and the valence band maximum (VBM) is at the ZeR connection, validating that BiOX is indirect semiconductor 19,20.The band gaps of BiOX decrease in turn with the increase of X atom number.A new impurity band appears in BiOX-OVs compared with pure BiOX, which is close to CBM for pure BiOX (XF, Cl, Br) and for BiOI is close to VBM.In addition, the VBM of BiOX-OVs performed more gradual than pure BiOX, verifying that the photogenerated carriers on BiOX-OVs have better separation efficiency due to the holes on VBM with a greater effective mass in the presence of OVs 50.Additionally, the presence of OVs increases the hybridization degree between the individual atomic orbitals in BiOX, resulting in the electronic band structure more intensive 52.Both VBM and CBM of BiOX-OVs are located at different high symmetry points in K space, indicating that the presence of OVs does not change the type of band gap transition.Correspondingly, the band gap of BiOX has a slight change in the condition of OVs, which is consistent with the report by Di, Fu et al. 41,53,54. The density of state (DOS) distributions of BiOX and BiOX-OVs are displayed in Fig. 12.The DOS peak of F-2s in BiOF is located at -21.0 to -19.6 eV, and the energy of X-ns band in BiOX gradually increases as the X atomic number increases.The band of O-2s centered at -18.0 to -14.0 eV and the band of Bi-6s is located at -11.0 to -7.0 eV in BiOX.It is worth noting that the band of X-ns is over the band of O-2s in BiOX (X Cl, Br, I) and the F-2s band is below the O-2s band in BiOF.Additionally, the I-5s band overlaps with the Bi-6s band in BiOI.Therefore, the distance between X-ns band and Bi-6s band is shortening as the X atomic number increases.The bands of O-2p and X-np mainly contribute to the VB, and the band of Bi-6p mainly contributes to the CB 19.Not only the new DOS band but also the increased DOS is observed in BiOX-OVs compared with BiOX, which proves that the introduction of OVs can generate more photogenerated carriers 39,46,55. Fig. 13 shows the electron density distribution of BiOX and BiOX-OVs.The electron density around the O in BiOX (X Cl, Br, I) is greater than that around Bi and X, but the electron density around F atom in BiOF is greater than that around Bi and O.The presence of OVs in BiOX might cause lattice distortion, which may redistribute the charge 56.In BiOX-OVs (X Cl, Br, I), the atom of O can capture electrons from Bi or X due to its strong electronegativity, which results in the electron density of O atoms increasing.While, it is worth noting that F can capture electrons on Bi or O due to the strong electronegativity of F in BiOF 57.Electron transfer energy can be reduced due to the reduced electronegativity with increasing atomic number of X.However, electron transfer energy could be increased with the ion radius raising 58.Therefore, the electron density of O for BiOBr is the highest among BiOX (X F, Cl, Br, I), which exhibits the best CO 2 photoreduction activity among the BiOX family. Combined the above experimental results with DFT calculation, the possible OVs mediated mechanism of BiOX for CO 2 photoreduction is proposed in Scheme2, taking bromine as an example.Formula 1 shows the surface structure with OVs for BiOBr catalyst.Firstly, oxygen atom in CO 2 molecule is adsorbed on the OVs and turn into lattice oxygen in the process of CO 2 photoreduction (2) 59.Formula 2 and 2' show the two equilibrium states of monodentate and bidentate adsorption of CO 2 respectively 60.The oxygen inserted into the lattice with strong electronegativity induces the charge shift of Bi-O bond 23.Therefore, the adjacent lattice oxygen with lower charge density is apt to be oxidized to OVs by two photogenerated holes (2h ) 61.That is to say, another OVs with two positive charges could be generated under the light illumination (3).The formula 3 with the structure of monodentate adsorption of CO 2 is the equilibrium state of formula 3' with the structure of bidentate adsorption of CO 2 .Oxygen atom in H 2 O molecule fills the OVs and produces two hydrogen protons (4) 61.The formula 4 or 4' gets an electron and a hydrogen proton to produce 5 or 5', in which 4 and 4', 5 and 5' are also two equilibrium states respectively.At last, the formula 5 also obtains one electron and one hydrogen proton to produce H 2 O and CO molecules and back to the initial state of the catalyst of 1 (blue flow line) 61.After that, the formula 5' gets one electron and one hydrogen proton to produce 6' with the hemiacetal adsorption states 62.Correspondingly, another OVs in formula 7' is formed under the irradiation of simulated sunlight due to the charge shift of Bi-O bond.Similarly, oxygen atom in H 2 O molecule fills the OVs and produces two hydrogen protons (8').Then, the formula 8' gets one electron and one hydrogen proton to produce 9' with the hemiacetal adsorption states 62.Finally, the formula 9' releases CH 4 and O 2 molecules and back to the initial state of the catalyst of 1 (green flow line). Recently, it is reported that the formation of COOH group is the rate limiting step for CO 2 reduction to CO or CH 4 because the formation energy of COOH is very high 60.Therefore, the higher light intensity is beneficial to the formation of COOH intermediate, further proving the forming of 5 is the rate limiting step for CO 2 reduction.According to the DFT calculation, OVs on defective surface could serve as active sites and enormously lower the barrier of the formation of COOH 63.The intensity of ESR peak in the irradiation of simulated sunlight is much higher than that under the irradiation of visible light ( 420 nm), indicating that the simulated sunlight irradiation could induce more photogenerated hole to oxidize lattice oxygen to generate OVs (Fig. S7a,b) 64, which play key roles of CO 2 photoreduction (step 3 and 7') 31,47,61.Furthermore, BiOBr exhibited much higher CO 2 photoreduction activity under the irradiation of simulated sunlight than that of visible light, further proving the UV light could induce more OVs and facilitate the generation of CO and H 2 O for BiOBr (Fig. S7c).Simultaneously, BiOBr with the irradiation of higher light intensity exhibits the almost 100 selectivity of the CO product, illustrating that the CO 2 photoreduction mechanism under the irradiation of higher light intensity is shown as the blue flow line.It was found that the key intermediate of 5' on the surface of BiOBr further combines with electrons and hydrogen protons to further produce CH 4 (green flow line).It is favorable to forming formula 5 instead of 5' under the irradiation of the high light intensity.Therefore, the products of CO 2 reduction are only CO and H 2 O without CH 4 at high light intensity.The reaction equations under the irradiation of simulated sunlight with high light intensity and low light intensity were shown in Fig. S8, respectively. In addition, according to the above results of DFT calculation, it could be speculated that the photogenerated carriers on BiOX with OVs have better separation efficiency owing to the more gradual band structure.The increased density of states induced by OVs for BiOX indicated the OVs could generate more photogenerated carriers.Furthermore, the presence of OVs could result in lattice distortion and redistribute charge.BiOBr exhibited the most excellent photocatalytic activity for CO 2 photoreduction among BiOX (X F, Cl, Br, I), which could be attributed to the appropriate atomic number, ion radius, electron density for Br and modest band gap, which could exhibit strong photocatalytic and thermal catalytic effects 40."}, {"llm generation": "BiOX family, BiOBr", "source": "In summary, BiOX family was prepared by both hydrothermal method and chemical precipitation method.Among them, BiOBr exhibited the best CO 2 photoreduction activity under the irradiation of simulated sunlight, which is 21.6 umol g -1 h -1 and 1.2 umol g -1 h -1 for the CO and CH 4 evolution respectively.", "context": "In summary, BiOX family was prepared by both hydrothermal method and chemical precipitation method.Among them, BiOBr exhibited the best CO 2 photoreduction activity under the irradiation of simulated sunlight, which is 21.6 umol g -1 h -1 and 1.2 umol g -1 h -1 for the CO and CH 4 evolution respectively.The higher light intensity is favorable to the selectivity of photocatalyst to generate CO product for CO 2 photoreduction.It is revealed that BiOX exhibited oxygen vacancy defects, which is benefit to the CO 2 adsorption and activation process.It is assumed that BiOBr showed the best CO 2 photoreduction activity due to the OVs, ionic radius, atomic number, electron density for Br and modest band structure.This work would provide some new insights for the deep understanding of the mechanism for CO 2 photoreduction of defect semiconductor.

Fig.5bdisplays functions of the CO and CH 4 yields over BiOBr as light intensity.It can be seen that with increasing light intensity, the product CO evolution is linearly increased, while the product CH 4 evolution in linearly increased and then decreased rapidly.This shows that the reduction to CO is an apparent first-order reaction versus light intensity, which implies there is a rate-determining step with one electron in the overall reduction half reaction needing 2 electrons and 2 protons (CO 2 2e- 2H CO H 2 O)31,32.As for the reduction to minor product CH 4 , it is also first-order reaction versus light intensity under low intensity illumination.Therefore it has also a rate-determining step with one electron.This suggests that the reduction to CO and the reduction to CH 4 may be a pair of parallel reactions and their rate-determining step occurs on the same sites of BiOX photocatalyst and competes for photogenerated electrons.However, the latter, which Fig. 8.

The photocatalytic activity of sample was evaluated by the reaction of CO 2 with H 2 O under a simulated solar light source.Fig. 5a shows the photocatalytic product distribution on BiOX under illumination.Except CO and CH 4 , none of other products were detected, and the yield of CO is significantly higher than that of CH 4 , indicating that CO is the major product.When the reaction was conducted in (Ar H 2 O) rather than (CO 2 H 2 O) atmosphere, almost no any reduction product is detected (Fig. S3), demonstrating that the filled CO 2 is indeed the source of CO 30.The ability of BiOX to convert CO 2 to CO increases first and then decreases as the number of X atoms increases.No CO was detected when the CO 2 catalytic reduction system is in the dark state, suggesting that light is a necessary condition for the reduction of CO 2 30,31.The BiOBr catalyst showed CO evolution as high as 21.6 mol g -1 h -1 during 3 h, and the reaction activity keeps stable during 12 h (Fig. S4).It can be seen that with increasing light intensity, the product CO evolution is linearly increased, while the product CH 4 evolution in linearly increased and then decreased rapidly.This shows that the reduction to CO is an apparent first-order reaction versus light intensity, which implies there is a rate-determining step with one electron in the overall reduction half reaction needing 2 electrons and 2 protons (CO 2 2e- 2H CO H 2 O) 31,32.As for the reduction to minor product CH 4 , it is also first-order reaction versus light intensity under low intensity illumination.Therefore it has also a rate-determining step with one electron.This suggests that the reduction to CO and the reduction to CH 4 may be a pair of parallel reactions and their rate-determining step occurs on the same sites of BiOX photocatalyst and competes for photogenerated electrons.However, the latter, which involves 8 electrons and 8 protons (CO 2 8e- 8H CH 4 2H 2 O), undergoes more reaction steps than the former only involving 2 electrons and 2 protons, and the product CO shows higher selectivity than the product CH 4 .In low light intensity, two reduction processes take place by their respective selectivity.The decrease in the CH 4 yield in high light intensity could be related with the increase in the reaction temperature induced by the strong illumination, which leads to the decrease of water adsorption and therefore inhibition for the subsequent reduction of the Intermediate species to CH 4 , which was supported by effect of water dosage on the reaction products (Fig. S6).The photocatalytic reduction yield of CO 2 to CO is almost unaffected by H 2 O (Fig. S6), while the reduction yield to CH 4 shows the maximum value in the dosage of 10 L water, in which both low and high water dosage are unfavorable for the reduction to CH 4 .The average apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) and solar conversion efficiency (SCE) were estimated by the results in Fig. 5b.The AQE is ca.1.26,and the SCE is ca.1.86 for the reaction 33.According to the yields of CO and CH 4 , it could be obtained that the yield of O 2 is ca.10.8 mol g -1 h -1 and 2.4 mol g -1 h -1 , respectively, which is close to the measured O 2 evolution amount (11.8 mol g -1 h -1 ), indicating that the reduction of CO 2 to CO and CH 4 occurs along with the oxidation of H 2 O to O 2 .The results of the isotope experiments performed in CO 2 and H 2 18 O is manifested in Fig. 5c.There are 16 O 2 (m/z 32), 16 O 18 O (m/z 34) and 18 O 2 (m/z 36) peaks in Fig. 5c and the relative abundance of 16 O 18 O is much higher than that of 16 O 2 and 18 O 2 .Since the photogenerated hole could oxidize H 2 18 O to form 18 O 2 and hydrogen protons.Then, CO 2 combines with a hydrogen proton and an electron to produce H 2 16 O 34, which could be further oxidized by hole to release 16 O 2 .Therefore, rapid oxygen isotope exchange equilibrium between 16 O 2 and 18 O 2 will result in a higher relative abundance of 16 O 18 O 35,36. Fig. 6a depicts the N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherm of BiOX with a type IV hysteresis loop, indicating the presence of mesoporous structures 27.The specific surface areas of BiOF, BiOCl, BiOBr, BiOI are 8.8, 30.1, 9.1 and 3.4 m 2 g -1 , respectively.The maximum CO 2 adsorption capacities of BiOF, BiOCl, BiOBr and BiOI at room temperature are 0.4, 0.3, 0.1 and 0.05 m 2 g -1 , respectively, as shown in Fig. 6b.No obvious correlation between the specific surface area and CO 2 adsorption capacity of BiOX is observed 37. It can be seen from Fig. 7a that BiOF and BiOCl can only harvest ultraviolet light, but BiOBr and BiOI can respond to visible light.Then, the band gaps of BiOX in Fig. 7b are estimated by the formula of ahv A(hv -E g ) n/2 .Among them, a, h, v, A and E g separately represent the photo-absorption coefficient, Planck constant, light frequency, a constant and the band gap 38.The value of n is 4 owing to the indirect transition of BiOX 20.The band position of BiOX are exhibited in Fig. 7d as the conduction band (CB) potential of n-type semiconductor with positive Mott-Scotty slope is approximate the flat band potential (Fig. 7c) 39.The valence band (VB) potential of BiOX can be estimated by E vb E cb E g .The Nyquist plots of BiOX in Fig. 7e reveal that photogenerated carrier separation of BiOBr has less electric resistance because of its small impedance radius 26.The PL spectra, in Fig. 7f, show the lower intensity of BiOBr and BiOI respectively, demonstrating that strong light absorption cannot be directly involved in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.However, strong light absorption can produce a strong photothermal effect to promote the generation and transfer of photogenerated carriers 30,40,41.Consequently, BiOBr and BiOI with strong photothermal effect owing to their efficient visible light absorption, which can speed up the separation of photogenerated carriers 22.The characteristic vibration band of 2336 cm -1 is related to the asymmetric stretching of CO 2 v as (CO 2 ), and the peak intensity is gradually weakened with the extension of illumination time 42.The characteristic vibration band of 1480 cm -1 is the characteristic vibration band of monodentate adsorption of CO 2 (m-CO 2 ).The vibration band at 1280 cm -1 , 1363 cm -1 , 1549 cm -1 and 1706 cm -1 belonging to the bidentate adsorption of CO 2 (b-CO 2 ) 43,44.The vibration bands of 1312 cm -1 , 1597 cm -1 , 2862 cm -1 and 2941 cm -1 belong to carboxyl species (COOH).The bands intensity at 1312 cm -1 , 1597 cm -1 are gradually increase and the band intensity at 2862 cm -1 , 2941 cm -1 are gradually decreases, indicating that COOH group is the crucial intermediate product during CO 2 reduction to CO and CH 4 434445. Fig. 9a shows the variation in ESR spectra of BiOF in air/CO 2 with or without simulated sunlight illumination.The characteristic ESR signal of OVs is observed in the air, which is enhanced under the illumination conditions 46.However, the characteristic ESR signal of OVs disappeared or weakened in CO 2 atmosphere, which suggests that the adsorption of CO 2 is in the position of oxygen vacancies of BiOF 47.The OVs signal in CO 2 atmosphere is enhanced in the lighting environment, inferring that the concentration of OVs increases after the light irradiation 47,48.The ESR spectra of BiOCl, BiOBr, and BiOI showed similar trends, as shown in Fig. 9b, c andd respectively. The PAL spectra and PAL parameters of BiOX is shown in Fig. 10 and Table1, respectively.The 1 component of 173.5 ps with 46.40 strength can be classified as OVs of BiOF 21, which is consistent with the XPS and ESR results 49.The intensity of OVs is 53.06, 54.10, 50.70 for BiOCl, BiOBr and BiOI, respectively. 2 component is caused by large defect clusters capturing positrons 50.The average electron density of large defect clusters is lower than that of small defect clusters, thus CO 2 is preferentially adsorbed at the OVs 51.The concentration of OVs of BiOBr is the highest among BiOX (X F, Cl, Br, I) according the PAL results, which exhibits the best CO 2 photoreduction activity among the BiOX family. Fig. 11 presents the electronic band structure of pure BiOX and BiOX-OVs.The maximum value of VB is set at a position where the energy is zero.It can be seen from the electronic band structure of BiOX that the conduction band minimum (CBM) is at the Z point and the valence band maximum (VBM) is at the ZeR connection, validating that BiOX is indirect semiconductor 19,20.The band gaps of BiOX decrease in turn with the increase of X atom number.A new impurity band appears in BiOX-OVs compared with pure BiOX, which is close to CBM for pure BiOX (XF, Cl, Br) and for BiOI is close to VBM.In addition, the VBM of BiOX-OVs performed more gradual than pure BiOX, verifying that the photogenerated carriers on BiOX-OVs have better separation efficiency due to the holes on VBM with a greater effective mass in the presence of OVs 50.Additionally, the presence of OVs increases the hybridization degree between the individual atomic orbitals in BiOX, resulting in the electronic band structure more intensive 52.Both VBM and CBM of BiOX-OVs are located at different high symmetry points in K space, indicating that the presence of OVs does not change the type of band gap transition.Correspondingly, the band gap of BiOX has a slight change in the condition of OVs, which is consistent with the report by Di, Fu et al. 41,53,54. The density of state (DOS) distributions of BiOX and BiOX-OVs are displayed in Fig. 12.The DOS peak of F-2s in BiOF is located at -21.0 to -19.6 eV, and the energy of X-ns band in BiOX gradually increases as the X atomic number increases.The band of O-2s centered at -18.0 to -14.0 eV and the band of Bi-6s is located at -11.0 to -7.0 eV in BiOX.It is worth noting that the band of X-ns is over the band of O-2s in BiOX (X Cl, Br, I) and the F-2s band is below the O-2s band in BiOF.Additionally, the I-5s band overlaps with the Bi-6s band in BiOI.Therefore, the distance between X-ns band and Bi-6s band is shortening as the X atomic number increases.The bands of O-2p and X-np mainly contribute to the VB, and the band of Bi-6p mainly contributes to the CB 19.Not only the new DOS band but also the increased DOS is observed in BiOX-OVs compared with BiOX, which proves that the introduction of OVs can generate more photogenerated carriers 39,46,55. Fig. 13 shows the electron density distribution of BiOX and BiOX-OVs.The electron density around the O in BiOX (X Cl, Br, I) is greater than that around Bi and X, but the electron density around F atom in BiOF is greater than that around Bi and O.The presence of OVs in BiOX might cause lattice distortion, which may redistribute the charge 56.In BiOX-OVs (X Cl, Br, I), the atom of O can capture electrons from Bi or X due to its strong electronegativity, which results in the electron density of O atoms increasing.While, it is worth noting that F can capture electrons on Bi or O due to the strong electronegativity of F in BiOF 57.Electron transfer energy can be reduced due to the reduced electronegativity with increasing atomic number of X.However, electron transfer energy could be increased with the ion radius raising 58.Therefore, the electron density of O for BiOBr is the highest among BiOX (X F, Cl, Br, I), which exhibits the best CO 2 photoreduction activity among the BiOX family. Combined the above experimental results with DFT calculation, the possible OVs mediated mechanism of BiOX for CO 2 photoreduction is proposed in Scheme2, taking bromine as an example.Formula 1 shows the surface structure with OVs for BiOBr catalyst.Firstly, oxygen atom in CO 2 molecule is adsorbed on the OVs and turn into lattice oxygen in the process of CO 2 photoreduction (2) 59.Formula 2 and 2' show the two equilibrium states of monodentate and bidentate adsorption of CO 2 respectively 60.The oxygen inserted into the lattice with strong electronegativity induces the charge shift of Bi-O bond 23.Therefore, the adjacent lattice oxygen with lower charge density is apt to be oxidized to OVs by two photogenerated holes (2h ) 61.That is to say, another OVs with two positive charges could be generated under the light illumination (3).The formula 3 with the structure of monodentate adsorption of CO 2 is the equilibrium state of formula 3' with the structure of bidentate adsorption of CO 2 .Oxygen atom in H 2 O molecule fills the OVs and produces two hydrogen protons (4) 61.The formula 4 or 4' gets an electron and a hydrogen proton to produce 5 or 5', in which 4 and 4', 5 and 5' are also two equilibrium states respectively.At last, the formula 5 also obtains one electron and one hydrogen proton to produce H 2 O and CO molecules and back to the initial state of the catalyst of 1 (blue flow line) 61.After that, the formula 5' gets one electron and one hydrogen proton to produce 6' with the hemiacetal adsorption states 62.Correspondingly, another OVs in formula 7' is formed under the irradiation of simulated sunlight due to the charge shift of Bi-O bond.Similarly, oxygen atom in H 2 O molecule fills the OVs and produces two hydrogen protons (8').Then, the formula 8' gets one electron and one hydrogen proton to produce 9' with the hemiacetal adsorption states 62.Finally, the formula 9' releases CH 4 and O 2 molecules and back to the initial state of the catalyst of 1 (green flow line). Recently, it is reported that the formation of COOH group is the rate limiting step for CO 2 reduction to CO or CH 4 because the formation energy of COOH is very high 60.Therefore, the higher light intensity is beneficial to the formation of COOH intermediate, further proving the forming of 5 is the rate limiting step for CO 2 reduction.According to the DFT calculation, OVs on defective surface could serve as active sites and enormously lower the barrier of the formation of COOH 63.The intensity of ESR peak in the irradiation of simulated sunlight is much higher than that under the irradiation of visible light ( 420 nm), indicating that the simulated sunlight irradiation could induce more photogenerated hole to oxidize lattice oxygen to generate OVs (Fig. S7a,b) 64, which play key roles of CO 2 photoreduction (step 3 and 7') 31,47,61.Furthermore, BiOBr exhibited much higher CO 2 photoreduction activity under the irradiation of simulated sunlight than that of visible light, further proving the UV light could induce more OVs and facilitate the generation of CO and H 2 O for BiOBr (Fig. S7c).Simultaneously, BiOBr with the irradiation of higher light intensity exhibits the almost 100 selectivity of the CO product, illustrating that the CO 2 photoreduction mechanism under the irradiation of higher light intensity is shown as the blue flow line.It was found that the key intermediate of 5' on the surface of BiOBr further combines with electrons and hydrogen protons to further produce CH 4 (green flow line).It is favorable to forming formula 5 instead of 5' under the irradiation of the high light intensity.Therefore, the products of CO 2 reduction are only CO and H 2 O without CH 4 at high light intensity.The reaction equations under the irradiation of simulated sunlight with high light intensity and low light intensity were shown in Fig. S8, respectively. In addition, according to the above results of DFT calculation, it could be speculated that the photogenerated carriers on BiOX with OVs have better separation efficiency owing to the more gradual band structure.The increased density of states induced by OVs for BiOX indicated the OVs could generate more photogenerated carriers.Furthermore, the presence of OVs could result in lattice distortion and redistribute charge.BiOBr exhibited the most excellent photocatalytic activity for CO 2 photoreduction among BiOX (X F, Cl, Br, I), which could be attributed to the appropriate atomic number, ion radius, electron density for Br and modest band gap, which could exhibit strong photocatalytic and thermal catalytic effects 40."}, {"llm generation": "UV", "source": "Furthermore, BiOBr exhibited much higher CO 2 photoreduction activity under the irradiation of simulated sunlight than that of visible light, further proving the UV light could induce more OVs and facilitate the generation of CO and H 2 O for BiOBr (Fig. S7c).", "context": "Fig. 1 displays the XRD patterns of the as-synthesized BiOX samples.The (001), (101), (002), (110), (102) crystal planes of as-prepared BiOF appear at 14.2, 27.8, 28.7, 33.8, 37.5, respectively, which is consistent with the tetragonal phase BiOF (JCPDS No. 73-1595) 21.The characteristic diffraction peaks of as-formed BiOCl appear at 12.0, 25.9, 32.5, 33.4, 40.9, corresponding to (001), ( 101), ( 110), ( 102), (112) lattice plane, respectively, which is coincide with the tetragonal phase BiOCl (JCPDS No. 06-0249) 22.The XRD peaks of as-prepared BiOBr are located at 10.9, 25.2, 31.7,32.2, and 57.1, corresponding to (001), ( 101), ( 102), ( 110) and (212) crystal faces of BiOBr (JCPDS No. 09-0393) 23, respectively.The diffraction peaks of as-synthesized BiOI at 9.7, 29.6, 31.7,45.4, 55.2correspond to the (001), ( 102), ( 110), ( 200), (212) crystal planes of tetragonal phase BiOI (JCPDS No. 10-0445) 24.In addition, no impurity peak is observed, demonstrating that the obtained sample is pure BiOX.Scheme 1 shows the schematic diagram of the crystal structure of BiOX 25. The SEM image of BiOF in Fig. 2a demonstrates that BiOF is nanosheet structure, which is further illustrated by the TEM image in Fig. 2b.The (002) plane of BiOF corresponds to the crystal diameter of 0.30 nm presented in Fig. 2c.As shown in Fig. 2d ande, the as-prepared BiOCl exhibits flower-like microsphere structure comprising of nanosheets with thickness of 15-40 nm, and the lattice stripe of 0.26 nm belongs to the (102) plane of BiOCl (Fig. 2f).It can be observed from Fig. 2g and h that the morphology of BiOBr is similar to that of BiOCl.The lattice spacing of 0.34 nm in Fig. 2i can be indexed as the (101) plane of BiOBr.From Fig. 2j andk, it is clear that the as-synthesized BiOI is made up of nanosheets, which is similar to that of BiOF.HRTEM image (Fig. 2I) gives a lattice stripe of 0.30 nm, corresponding to the (102) crystal plane of BiOI.In addition, the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of BiOI (Fig. 2l inset) is presented in the form of diffraction spots, indicating that it is single crystal structure 23.It is worth noting that the as-prepared BiOX except BiOI is polycrystalline structure due to the diffraction ring of SAED pattern, which are displayed in Fig. 2c, f and i respectively.EDX element mapping of Bi, O, and X for BiOX is manifested in Fig. S1, indicating that the elements of Bi, O, and X uniformly distribute in BiOX.The Bi/X atomic percentage obtained by the EDX (Fig. S2) approximates to 1, demonstrating the synthesized BiOX with stoichiometric ratio. High resolution XPS spectra of Bi, O and corresponding X for BiOX are exhibited in Fig. 3.The characteristic peak of F 1s in Fig. 3a1 is located at 683.9 eV, which corresponds to the F -ions in BiOF 21.In Fig. 3a2, the peaks at 197.9 eV and 199.5 eV are related to Cl 2p 3/2 and Cl 2p 1/2 22, respectively.As can be seen from Fig. 3a3, the peak of Br 3d is deconvolved into two peaks at 68.3 eV and 69.4 eV, which can be classified as Br - 26.The two peaks at 619.3 eV and 630.7 eV in Fig. 3a4 are assigned to I 3d 5/2 and I 3d 3/2 27, respectively.The Bi 4f spectrum of BiOF in Fig. 3b1 displays a pair of peaks at 159.4 eV and 164.8 eV, corresponding to Bi 4f 7/2 and Bi 4f 5/ are associated with Bi 3 -O, oxygen vacancies (OVs) and adsorbed oxygen in Fig. 3 c1 2, respectively.This phenomenon is also confirmed by BiOCl, BiOBr and BiOI, as illustrated in Fig. 3c2, c3 and c4, respectively, indicating that there are some OVs in the as-prepared BiOX. Fig. 4 shows the Raman spectra of BiOX.The vibration band of 170 cm -1 in BiOF is related to the stretching mode of A1g internal Bi-F 28.As the X atom number increases, the Bi-X active vibration band in BiOX gradually moves toward the low wavenumber direction.The vibration band of 200 cm -1 in BiOCl is classified into the E g internal Bi-Cl stretching mode 29.The vibration band at 69 cm -1 in BiOX is characteristic vibration band of OVs, which is consistent with the XPS results 23. The photocatalytic activity of sample was evaluated by the reaction of CO 2 with H 2 O under a simulated solar light source.Fig. 5a shows the photocatalytic product distribution on BiOX under illumination.Except CO and CH 4 , none of other products were detected, and the yield of CO is significantly higher than that of CH 4 , indicating that CO is the major product.When the reaction was conducted in (Ar H 2 O) rather than (CO 2 H 2 O) atmosphere, almost no any reduction product is detected (Fig. S3), demonstrating that the filled CO 2 is indeed the source of CO 30.The ability of BiOX to convert CO 2 to CO increases first and then decreases as the number of X atoms increases.No CO was detected when the CO 2 catalytic reduction system is in the dark state, suggesting that light is a necessary condition for the reduction of CO 2 30,31.The BiOBr catalyst showed CO evolution as high as 21.6 mol g -1 h -1 during 3 h, and the reaction activity keeps stable during 12 h (Fig. S4).It can be seen that with increasing light intensity, the product CO evolution is linearly increased, while the product CH 4 evolution in linearly increased and then decreased rapidly.This shows that the reduction to CO is an apparent first-order reaction versus light intensity, which implies there is a rate-determining step with one electron in the overall reduction half reaction needing 2 electrons and 2 protons (CO 2 2e- 2H CO H 2 O) 31,32.As for the reduction to minor product CH 4 , it is also first-order reaction versus light intensity under low intensity illumination.Therefore it has also a rate-determining step with one electron.This suggests that the reduction to CO and the reduction to CH 4 may be a pair of parallel reactions and their rate-determining step occurs on the same sites of BiOX photocatalyst and competes for photogenerated electrons.However, the latter, which involves 8 electrons and 8 protons (CO 2 8e- 8H CH 4 2H 2 O), undergoes more reaction steps than the former only involving 2 electrons and 2 protons, and the product CO shows higher selectivity than the product CH 4 .In low light intensity, two reduction processes take place by their respective selectivity.The decrease in the CH 4 yield in high light intensity could be related with the increase in the reaction temperature induced by the strong illumination, which leads to the decrease of water adsorption and therefore inhibition for the subsequent reduction of the Intermediate species to CH 4 , which was supported by effect of water dosage on the reaction products (Fig. S6).The photocatalytic reduction yield of CO 2 to CO is almost unaffected by H 2 O (Fig. S6), while the reduction yield to CH 4 shows the maximum value in the dosage of 10 L water, in which both low and high water dosage are unfavorable for the reduction to CH 4 .The average apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) and solar conversion efficiency (SCE) were estimated by the results in Fig. 5b.The AQE is ca.1.26,and the SCE is ca.1.86 for the reaction 33.According to the yields of CO and CH 4 , it could be obtained that the yield of O 2 is ca.10.8 mol g -1 h -1 and 2.4 mol g -1 h -1 , respectively, which is close to the measured O 2 evolution amount (11.8 mol g -1 h -1 ), indicating that the reduction of CO 2 to CO and CH 4 occurs along with the oxidation of H 2 O to O 2 .The results of the isotope experiments performed in CO 2 and H 2 18 O is manifested in Fig. 5c.There are 16 O 2 (m/z 32), 16 O 18 O (m/z 34) and 18 O 2 (m/z 36) peaks in Fig. 5c and the relative abundance of 16 O 18 O is much higher than that of 16 O 2 and 18 O 2 .Since the photogenerated hole could oxidize H 2 18 O to form 18 O 2 and hydrogen protons.Then, CO 2 combines with a hydrogen proton and an electron to produce H 2 16 O 34, which could be further oxidized by hole to release 16 O 2 .Therefore, rapid oxygen isotope exchange equilibrium between 16 O 2 and 18 O 2 will result in a higher relative abundance of 16 O 18 O 35,36. Fig. 6a depicts the N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherm of BiOX with a type IV hysteresis loop, indicating the presence of mesoporous structures 27.The specific surface areas of BiOF, BiOCl, BiOBr, BiOI are 8.8, 30.1, 9.1 and 3.4 m 2 g -1 , respectively.The maximum CO 2 adsorption capacities of BiOF, BiOCl, BiOBr and BiOI at room temperature are 0.4, 0.3, 0.1 and 0.05 m 2 g -1 , respectively, as shown in Fig. 6b.No obvious correlation between the specific surface area and CO 2 adsorption capacity of BiOX is observed 37. It can be seen from Fig. 7a that BiOF and BiOCl can only harvest ultraviolet light, but BiOBr and BiOI can respond to visible light.Then, the band gaps of BiOX in Fig. 7b are estimated by the formula of ahv A(hv -E g ) n/2 .Among them, a, h, v, A and E g separately represent the photo-absorption coefficient, Planck constant, light frequency, a constant and the band gap 38.The value of n is 4 owing to the indirect transition of BiOX 20.The band position of BiOX are exhibited in Fig. 7d as the conduction band (CB) potential of n-type semiconductor with positive Mott-Scotty slope is approximate the flat band potential (Fig. 7c) 39.The valence band (VB) potential of BiOX can be estimated by E vb E cb E g .The Nyquist plots of BiOX in Fig. 7e reveal that photogenerated carrier separation of BiOBr has less electric resistance because of its small impedance radius 26.The PL spectra, in Fig. 7f, show the lower intensity of BiOBr and BiOI respectively, demonstrating that strong light absorption cannot be directly involved in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.However, strong light absorption can produce a strong photothermal effect to promote the generation and transfer of photogenerated carriers 30,40,41.Consequently, BiOBr and BiOI with strong photothermal effect owing to their efficient visible light absorption, which can speed up the separation of photogenerated carriers 22.The characteristic vibration band of 2336 cm -1 is related to the asymmetric stretching of CO 2 v as (CO 2 ), and the peak intensity is gradually weakened with the extension of illumination time 42.The characteristic vibration band of 1480 cm -1 is the characteristic vibration band of monodentate adsorption of CO 2 (m-CO 2 ).The vibration band at 1280 cm -1 , 1363 cm -1 , 1549 cm -1 and 1706 cm -1 belonging to the bidentate adsorption of CO 2 (b-CO 2 ) 43,44.The vibration bands of 1312 cm -1 , 1597 cm -1 , 2862 cm -1 and 2941 cm -1 belong to carboxyl species (COOH).The bands intensity at 1312 cm -1 , 1597 cm -1 are gradually increase and the band intensity at 2862 cm -1 , 2941 cm -1 are gradually decreases, indicating that COOH group is the crucial intermediate product during CO 2 reduction to CO and CH 4 434445. Fig. 9a shows the variation in ESR spectra of BiOF in air/CO 2 with or without simulated sunlight illumination.The characteristic ESR signal of OVs is observed in the air, which is enhanced under the illumination conditions 46.However, the characteristic ESR signal of OVs disappeared or weakened in CO 2 atmosphere, which suggests that the adsorption of CO 2 is in the position of oxygen vacancies of BiOF 47.The OVs signal in CO 2 atmosphere is enhanced in the lighting environment, inferring that the concentration of OVs increases after the light irradiation 47,48.The ESR spectra of BiOCl, BiOBr, and BiOI showed similar trends, as shown in Fig. 9b, c andd respectively. The PAL spectra and PAL parameters of BiOX is shown in Fig. 10 and Table1, respectively.The 1 component of 173.5 ps with 46.40 strength can be classified as OVs of BiOF 21, which is consistent with the XPS and ESR results 49.The intensity of OVs is 53.06, 54.10, 50.70 for BiOCl, BiOBr and BiOI, respectively. 2 component is caused by large defect clusters capturing positrons 50.The average electron density of large defect clusters is lower than that of small defect clusters, thus CO 2 is preferentially adsorbed at the OVs 51.The concentration of OVs of BiOBr is the highest among BiOX (X F, Cl, Br, I) according the PAL results, which exhibits the best CO 2 photoreduction activity among the BiOX family. Fig. 11 presents the electronic band structure of pure BiOX and BiOX-OVs.The maximum value of VB is set at a position where the energy is zero.It can be seen from the electronic band structure of BiOX that the conduction band minimum (CBM) is at the Z point and the valence band maximum (VBM) is at the ZeR connection, validating that BiOX is indirect semiconductor 19,20.The band gaps of BiOX decrease in turn with the increase of X atom number.A new impurity band appears in BiOX-OVs compared with pure BiOX, which is close to CBM for pure BiOX (XF, Cl, Br) and for BiOI is close to VBM.In addition, the VBM of BiOX-OVs performed more gradual than pure BiOX, verifying that the photogenerated carriers on BiOX-OVs have better separation efficiency due to the holes on VBM with a greater effective mass in the presence of OVs 50.Additionally, the presence of OVs increases the hybridization degree between the individual atomic orbitals in BiOX, resulting in the electronic band structure more intensive 52.Both VBM and CBM of BiOX-OVs are located at different high symmetry points in K space, indicating that the presence of OVs does not change the type of band gap transition.Correspondingly, the band gap of BiOX has a slight change in the condition of OVs, which is consistent with the report by Di, Fu et al. 41,53,54. The density of state (DOS) distributions of BiOX and BiOX-OVs are displayed in Fig. 12.The DOS peak of F-2s in BiOF is located at -21.0 to -19.6 eV, and the energy of X-ns band in BiOX gradually increases as the X atomic number increases.The band of O-2s centered at -18.0 to -14.0 eV and the band of Bi-6s is located at -11.0 to -7.0 eV in BiOX.It is worth noting that the band of X-ns is over the band of O-2s in BiOX (X Cl, Br, I) and the F-2s band is below the O-2s band in BiOF.Additionally, the I-5s band overlaps with the Bi-6s band in BiOI.Therefore, the distance between X-ns band and Bi-6s band is shortening as the X atomic number increases.The bands of O-2p and X-np mainly contribute to the VB, and the band of Bi-6p mainly contributes to the CB 19.Not only the new DOS band but also the increased DOS is observed in BiOX-OVs compared with BiOX, which proves that the introduction of OVs can generate more photogenerated carriers 39,46,55. Fig. 13 shows the electron density distribution of BiOX and BiOX-OVs.The electron density around the O in BiOX (X Cl, Br, I) is greater than that around Bi and X, but the electron density around F atom in BiOF is greater than that around Bi and O.The presence of OVs in BiOX might cause lattice distortion, which may redistribute the charge 56.In BiOX-OVs (X Cl, Br, I), the atom of O can capture electrons from Bi or X due to its strong electronegativity, which results in the electron density of O atoms increasing.While, it is worth noting that F can capture electrons on Bi or O due to the strong electronegativity of F in BiOF 57.Electron transfer energy can be reduced due to the reduced electronegativity with increasing atomic number of X.However, electron transfer energy could be increased with the ion radius raising 58.Therefore, the electron density of O for BiOBr is the highest among BiOX (X F, Cl, Br, I), which exhibits the best CO 2 photoreduction activity among the BiOX family. Combined the above experimental results with DFT calculation, the possible OVs mediated mechanism of BiOX for CO 2 photoreduction is proposed in Scheme2, taking bromine as an example.Formula 1 shows the surface structure with OVs for BiOBr catalyst.Firstly, oxygen atom in CO 2 molecule is adsorbed on the OVs and turn into lattice oxygen in the process of CO 2 photoreduction (2) 59.Formula 2 and 2' show the two equilibrium states of monodentate and bidentate adsorption of CO 2 respectively 60.The oxygen inserted into the lattice with strong electronegativity induces the charge shift of Bi-O bond 23.Therefore, the adjacent lattice oxygen with lower charge density is apt to be oxidized to OVs by two photogenerated holes (2h ) 61.That is to say, another OVs with two positive charges could be generated under the light illumination (3).The formula 3 with the structure of monodentate adsorption of CO 2 is the equilibrium state of formula 3' with the structure of bidentate adsorption of CO 2 .Oxygen atom in H 2 O molecule fills the OVs and produces two hydrogen protons (4) 61.The formula 4 or 4' gets an electron and a hydrogen proton to produce 5 or 5', in which 4 and 4', 5 and 5' are also two equilibrium states respectively.At last, the formula 5 also obtains one electron and one hydrogen proton to produce H 2 O and CO molecules and back to the initial state of the catalyst of 1 (blue flow line) 61.After that, the formula 5' gets one electron and one hydrogen proton to produce 6' with the hemiacetal adsorption states 62.Correspondingly, another OVs in formula 7' is formed under the irradiation of simulated sunlight due to the charge shift of Bi-O bond.Similarly, oxygen atom in H 2 O molecule fills the OVs and produces two hydrogen protons (8').Then, the formula 8' gets one electron and one hydrogen proton to produce 9' with the hemiacetal adsorption states 62.Finally, the formula 9' releases CH 4 and O 2 molecules and back to the initial state of the catalyst of 1 (green flow line). Recently, it is reported that the formation of COOH group is the rate limiting step for CO 2 reduction to CO or CH 4 because the formation energy of COOH is very high 60.Therefore, the higher light intensity is beneficial to the formation of COOH intermediate, further proving the forming of 5 is the rate limiting step for CO 2 reduction.According to the DFT calculation, OVs on defective surface could serve as active sites and enormously lower the barrier of the formation of COOH 63.The intensity of ESR peak in the irradiation of simulated sunlight is much higher than that under the irradiation of visible light ( 420 nm), indicating that the simulated sunlight irradiation could induce more photogenerated hole to oxidize lattice oxygen to generate OVs (Fig. S7a,b) 64, which play key roles of CO 2 photoreduction (step 3 and 7') 31,47,61.Furthermore, BiOBr exhibited much higher CO 2 photoreduction activity under the irradiation of simulated sunlight than that of visible light, further proving the UV light could induce more OVs and facilitate the generation of CO and H 2 O for BiOBr (Fig. S7c).Simultaneously, BiOBr with the irradiation of higher light intensity exhibits the almost 100 selectivity of the CO product, illustrating that the CO 2 photoreduction mechanism under the irradiation of higher light intensity is shown as the blue flow line.It was found that the key intermediate of 5' on the surface of BiOBr further combines with electrons and hydrogen protons to further produce CH 4 (green flow line).It is favorable to forming formula 5 instead of 5' under the irradiation of the high light intensity.Therefore, the products of CO 2 reduction are only CO and H 2 O without CH 4 at high light intensity.The reaction equations under the irradiation of simulated sunlight with high light intensity and low light intensity were shown in Fig. S8, respectively. In addition, according to the above results of DFT calculation, it could be speculated that the photogenerated carriers on BiOX with OVs have better separation efficiency owing to the more gradual band structure.The increased density of states induced by OVs for BiOX indicated the OVs could generate more photogenerated carriers.Furthermore, the presence of OVs could result in lattice distortion and redistribute charge.BiOBr exhibited the most excellent photocatalytic activity for CO 2 photoreduction among BiOX (X F, Cl, Br, I), which could be attributed to the appropriate atomic number, ion radius, electron density for Br and modest band gap, which could exhibit strong photocatalytic and thermal catalytic effects 40."}, {"llm generation": "simulated sunlight", "source": "Among them, BiOBr exhibited the best CO 2 photoreduction activity under the irradiation of simulated sunlight, which is 21.6 umol g -1 h -1 and 1.2 umol g -1 h -1 for the CO and CH 4 evolution respectively.", "context": "In summary, BiOX family was prepared by both hydrothermal method and chemical precipitation method.Among them, BiOBr exhibited the best CO 2 photoreduction activity under the irradiation of simulated sunlight, which is 21.6 umol g -1 h -1 and 1.2 umol g -1 h -1 for the CO and CH 4 evolution respectively.The higher light intensity is favorable to the selectivity of photocatalyst to generate CO product for CO 2 photoreduction.It is revealed that BiOX exhibited oxygen vacancy defects, which is benefit to the CO 2 adsorption and activation process.It is assumed that BiOBr showed the best CO 2 photoreduction activity due to the OVs, ionic radius, atomic number, electron density for Br and modest band structure.This work would provide some new insights for the deep understanding of the mechanism for CO 2 photoreduction of defect semiconductor.

Fig.5bdisplays functions of the CO and CH 4 yields over BiOBr as light intensity.It can be seen that with increasing light intensity, the product CO evolution is linearly increased, while the product CH 4 evolution in linearly increased and then decreased rapidly.This shows that the reduction to CO is an apparent first-order reaction versus light intensity, which implies there is a rate-determining step with one electron in the overall reduction half reaction needing 2 electrons and 2 protons (CO 2 2e- 2H CO H 2 O)31,32.As for the reduction to minor product CH 4 , it is also first-order reaction versus light intensity under low intensity illumination.Therefore it has also a rate-determining step with one electron.This suggests that the reduction to CO and the reduction to CH 4 may be a pair of parallel reactions and their rate-determining step occurs on the same sites of BiOX photocatalyst and competes for photogenerated electrons.However, the latter, which Fig. 8.
