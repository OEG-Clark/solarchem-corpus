The cobalt complex was synthesized with the same procedure in the literature with a slight modification 25.Typically, 150 lmol of NH 2 -bpy (28.0 mg) was dissolved in 10.0 ml of methanol in a three-neck rounded bottom flask fitted with a reflux condenser and heated to 70-75 C under continuous stirring.After that, 50 lmol of CoCl 2 A6H 2 O (11.9 mg) dissolved in 5.0 ml of methanol was added drop by drop to this solution.The mixed solution was refluxed at 75 C for 24 h. In a typical synthesis, 10 g of urea was dissolved in 100 ml of anhydrous ethanol with continuous stirring at 70 C.Then, 5 ml of methanol contained several lmol of cobalt complex (1-20 lmol) was added drop by drop to this solution, followed by drying at 70-75 C.The obtained solid was subjected to calcination in a semiclose crucible with the temperature profiles as follow: holding the temperature at 135 C (at the melting point temperature of urea) for 2 h (ramping rate 5 C/min), then at 500 C for 2 h with a ramping rate 5 C/min.This material was denoted as C 3 N 4 -mCoO x with 'm' is the weight percent of cobalt in the material.The calculated concentrations of cobalt in the synthesized materials are 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0 wt when using 1, 5, 10, 20 lmol of cobalt complex, respectively.The bulk g-C 3 N 4 was synthesized under the same condition without the addition of cobalt complex. For comparison, several control samples were also prepared in the same manner as the following: C 3 N 4 -mCoB was synthesized using cobalt complex without -NH 2 group in the ligands, C 3 N 4 -0CoO x was prepared by adding just NH 2 -bpy ligand (without cobalt) with the same amount as in C 3 N 4 -0.5CoOx .Both C 3 N 4 -mCoO x -D and C 3 N 4 -mCoO x -M were also synthesized in the same manner as that of C 3 N 4 -mCoO x using dicyandiamide and melamine as precursor instead of urea, respectively. N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms were obtained at A196 C using a Quantachrome Autosorb-1 MP analyzer, and the samples were outgassed under vacuum for 4 h at 120 C before the measurements.X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Bruker SMART APEX II X-ray diffractometer equipped with a Cu Ka radiation source with k 1.5418A. UV-vis spectra were recorded on a Cary 300 Bio UV-vis spectrophotometer.Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images and elemental mapping were obtained using a JEOL 6360 instrument at 155 kV.X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed in the ion-pumped chamber (9-10 Torr) of a photoelectron spectrometer (Kratos Axis Ultra), the light source was X-ray (Al Ka; hm 1486.6eV), and the adventitious C peak located at 284.5 eV was used for the internal calibration.Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) absorption spectra were measured with an FTS 45 IR spectrophotometer with KBr as a reference. The spray-coating technique was used for the preparation of a working electrode.Typically, 5 mg of the photocatalyst was dispersed in 5 ml of ethanol and sonicated to obtain a homogeneous dispersion of slurry materials.This slurry was then spray-coated onto an area of 2 cm 2 of hot F-doped SnO 2 (FTO) glass, followed by drying overnight at 80 C.The transient photocurrent response was recorded on a three-electrode system using an electrochemical workstation.The as-prepared electrode, a Pt wire electrode, and a saturated calomel electrode were utilized as working, counter, and reference electrode, respectively.The photocurrent as a function of time was recorded as the light was switched on and off every 10 s.The electrochemical impedance was also recorded on the same system with a frequency range from 0.1 MHz to 0.1 Hz.All photoelectrochemical measurements were carried out in a threeelectrode system (Autolab PGSTAT204) with 0.5 M Na 2 SO 4 as the electrolyte and irradiated with simulated solar light (150 W Xe lamp).The photocurrent was measured at a bias voltage of 0.0 V under solar light irradiation (150 W Xe lamp) with 10 s light onoff cycle.The electrolyte was purged with Argon for 20 min before any photoelectrochemical measurements. In a typical photocatalytic reaction, a specific amount of photocatalyst was dispersed in a mixture of 9 ml acetonitrile, and 1 ml triethanolamine (TEOA) in a 40 ml quartz test tube.Before photocatalytic testing, the reaction solution was bubbled with CO 2 (99.9,Praxair) in the dark for 20 min and then sealed with a rubber septum.The reaction was then irradiated with solar light irradiation (ABET SN103 Model 11,002 SunLite TM Solar Simulators, 150 W Xe lamp, AM 1.5G, 100mW.cmA2 ).For visible-light irradiation, a long-pass filter was used (Thorlabs, FGL420 -25 mm).For Apparent Quantum Yield calculation, bandpass filters were used (Thorlabs, FB420-10, or FL460-10) to transmit wavelength band of light at 420 nm and 460 nm.The headspace above the reaction solution was sampled with a gas-tight syringe at different time intervals for product analysis using GC equipped with a TCD detector and a Carboxen TM 1010 PLOT column.CO is detected as the major reduction component with a minor amount of H 2 . The Apparent quantum yield (AQY) is defined by the following equation: Since two electrons are involved in the conversion of CO 2 to CO, AQE for CO can be calculated as the following equation: The number of evolved CO molecules The number of incident photons A 100 The photon flux was measured with Newport's power meter (1918-C Optical Power Meter) equipped with a thermopile optical detector.The AQY at 420 nm was calculated from the experimental data as follows.The photon flux at 420 nm is 2.12 A 10 14 photon.s A1 .cmA2 .A 7 cm 2 area of the sample was irradiated for 7.5 h.Therefore, the number of incident photons was calculated as follows: N incident photons 14 2:12 A 10 14 photon:s For CO 2 reduction, one photon generates one electron, so two photons are required to produce one CO molecule.The molar of generated CO under 420 nm for 7.5 h was determined to be 1.1 lmol.Therefore, the AQY was calculated as follows: 4:0 A 10 19 A 100 14 3:2 The similar calculation was applied for AQY at 460 nm, with the photon flux of 3.57 A 10 14 photon.sA1 .cmA2 , a 7 cm 2 area of the sample was irradiated for 8.5 h, the molar of generated CO under 460 nm for h was 0.65 lmol.Thus, the AQY at 460 nm was calculated to be 1.0."}], "reaction medium": [], "reactor type": [], "operation mode": []}}
