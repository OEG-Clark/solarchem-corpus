X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained on a D/Max-RB X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku, Japan), under Cu Ka radiation at a scan rate (2y) of 0.051 s A1 .The accelerating voltage and applied current were 40 kV and 80 mA, respectively.Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution TEM (HRTEM) analysis were conducted on a Tecnai G 2 F20 S-TWIN microscope at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV.X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were done by using an ultra-high-vacuum VG ESCALAB 210 electron spectrometer equipped with a multichannel detector.The spectrum was excited by Mg Ka radiation of two anodes in the constant analyzer energy mode and operating at 200 W.All the binding energies were referenced to the C 1s peak at 285.0 eV of the surface adventitious carbon.UV-visible absorbance spectra were obtained by using the die-pressed disk sample and a UV-visible spectrophotometer (UV-2550, SHIMADZU, Japan), in which BaSO 4 was used as the reflectance standard.Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR) of the samples were evaluated using an IR Affiinity-1 FTIR spectrometer which used conventional KBr pellets in the range of 4000-500 cm A1 at room temperature.The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface area (S BET ) of powder was recorded by using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 nitrogen adsorption apparatus (USA).All of the samples were degassed at 180 1C before measurement.The pore size distributions were determined using desorption data by the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method.The BET surface area was determined by a multipoint BET method using the adsorption data in the relative pressure (P/P 0 ) range of 0.05-0.25.Photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra were used to investigate the fate of photogenerated electrons and holes in the samples, and were measured at room temperature on an F-7000 Fluorescence Spectrophotometer (Hitachi, Japan).The excitation wavelength is 380 nm, the scanning speed is 1200 nm min A1 , and the photomultiplier tube (PMT) voltage is 700 V.The width of both the excitation slit and the emission slit was 1.0 nm. The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 was carried out in a 200 mL home-made Pyrex reactor at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure.The reactor has two openings which were sealed using a silicone rubber septum.A 300 W simulated solar Xe arc lamp was used as the light source and positioned 10 cm above the photocatalytic reactor.In a typical photocatalytic experiment, 100 mg of the sample was put into the glass reactor and 10 mL of deionized water was added.The catalyst was dispersed by ultrasonication for about 30 min to form suspension.After evaporation of water at 80 1C for 2 h, the sample was deposited on the bottom of the reactor in the form of thin films.Before irradiation, the reactor was blown with nitrogen for 30 min to remove air and ensure that the reaction system was under anaerobic conditions.CO 2 and H 2 O vapor were in situ generated by the reaction of NaHCO 3 (0.12 g, introduced into the reactor before seal) and HCl aqueous solution (0.25 mL, 4 M) which was introduced into the reactor using a syringe. 1 mL of mixed gas was taken from the reactor at given intervals (1 h) during the irradiation and used for gas component analysis by a gas chromatograph (GC-2014C, Shimadzu, Japan) equipped with a flame ionized detector (FID) and a methanizer.Products were calibrated with a standard gas and determined by the retention time.The carrier gas used in the GC-2014C was high purity nitrogen.The product of the experiment was also analyzed by another gas chromatograph (GC-14C, Shimadzu, Japan, TCD, 5 A molecular sieve column) which also used nitrogen as carrier gas.Blank experiments were carried out in the absence of CO 2 or light irradiation to confirm that CO 2 and light were two key influencing elements for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.Control experiments were also used to verify whether the carbon resource was derived from CO 2 or the catalyst itself. Photocurrent measurements were conducted on a CHI 660D electrochemical workstation (Chenhua Instrument, Shanghai, China) in a conventional three-electrode configuration using a working electrode, a counter electrode and a reference electrode. The working electrodes have an active area of ca.0.5 cm 2 , and a Pt wire and Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) were used as the counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively.A low power LED (3 W, 420 nm) (Shenzhen LAMPLIC Science Co. Ltd.China) was used as the light source and the focused intensity was ca.80.0 mW cm A2 .The electrolyte utilized in the photocurrent measurement is 1 M Na 2 SO 4 aqueous solution.The working electrodes were prepared as follows: 0.2 g of the as-prepared sample was mixed with 0.08 g of polyethylene glycol (PEG, molecular weight: 20 000) and 2 mL of water, then the mixture was ground to form a slurry.Next, the slurry was coated onto a pre-cleaned 2 cm A 1.2 cm F-doped SnO 2 -coated glass (FTO glass) electrode by the doctor blade technique.The prepared electrodes were dried and then calcined at 450 1C for 30 min in an oven with a heating rate of 5 1C min A1 ."}, {"llm generation": "g-C 3 N 4 -Pt nanocomposites", "source": "Graphitic carbon nitride g-C 3 N 4 was synthesized by directly heating thiourea at 550 1C and a certain amount of Pt was deposited on g-C 3 N 4 to form g-C 3 N 4 -Pt nanocomposites, which were used as catalysts for photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 under simulated solar irradiation.", "context": "Graphitic carbon nitride g-C 3 N 4 was synthesized by directly heating thiourea at 550 1C and a certain amount of Pt was deposited on g-C 3 N 4 to form g-C 3 N 4 -Pt nanocomposites, which were used as catalysts for photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 under simulated solar irradiation.The content of Pt displayed a significant influence on the activity and selectivity of g-C 3 N 4 for photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 into CH 4 , CH 3 OH and HCHO.The Pt NPs were shown to be an effective cocatalyst, which not only influenced the selectivity of the product generation, but also affected the photoactivity of the g-C 3 N 4 .The yields of CH 4 and CH 3 OH increased upon increasing the content of Pt deposited on the g-C 3 N 4 from 0 to 1 wt, and the yield of HCHO increased as the Pt content increased from 0 to 0.75 wt but decreased when more Pt is deposited.What's more, CH 4 and HCHO can be generated more quickly upon increasing the Pt loading from 0 to 1 wt.The Pt acted as a cocatalyst which could facilitate electron transfer and enrich more photogenerated electrons on its surface for photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .At the same time, Pt also acts as a catalyst to promote the oxidation of the HCHO product.The transient photocurrent responses further confirm the proposed mechanism of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.This work not only indicates that the photoactivity and selectivity of g-C 3 N 4 for CO 2 reduction can be mediated by a small amount of deposited Pt NPs, but also shows that CO 2 can be easily converted into valuable hydrocarbon solar fuels at ambient temperature and pressure.

was used to reveal phase structures of g-C 3 N 4 -Pt nanocomposite photocatalysts.Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of the Pt0, Pt0.25, Pt0.5, Pt0.75, Pt1.0 and Pt2.0 samples.Two distinct diffraction peaks can be found in the XRD patterns of all samples.The strong peak at around 27.41 is ascribed to interplanar stacking of aromatic systems, which is indexed to the (002) peak and corresponded to an interlayer distance of d 0.326 nm. 27The smaller peak (100) at around 13.11 corresponding to a distance of d 0.675 nm can be attributed to an in-planar structural packing motif. 28The two characteristic diffraction peaks show that the samples are graphitic carbon nitride, which is consistent with the previous reports. 21,22,29he XRD patterns of all samples show no characteristic diffraction peaks attributed to the phase structure of Pt because of its low loading content.Further observation of the XRD patterns shows that diffraction peak positions of all the samples remain unchanged upon Pt incorporation, suggesting that the Pt is deposited on the surface of g-C 3 N 4 instead of being incorporated into the lattice of g-C 3 N 4 .TEM was further used to investigate the

a binding energy of 71.5 eV, and the peaks at the binding energies of 979.1 and 999.1 eV are assigned to O KLL and the photoelectron peaks at 497.3 and 1072 eV correspond to Na KLL and Na 1s for the Pt1.0 sample. 31The sodium species results from the residual Na , which is introduced by the process of Pt deposition. Fig. 3b-d display the high-resolution XPS spectra of the elements C 1s, N 1s and Pt 4f, respectively.As observed from Fig. 3b, the C 1s peak can be fitted into three peaks at binding energies of 284.8, 286.9 and 288.6 eV for both Pt0 and Pt1.0 samples, which can be ascribed to C-C, (C) 3 -N and C-NQC coordination, respectively. 14, 23 The C-C coordination was attributed to surface adventitious carbon, which comes from the sample and the XPS instrument itself.The high-resolution XPS spectrum of N 1s (Fig. 3c) can be deconvoluted into four peaks appearing at binding energies of 398.4,399.4,400.5, and 403.9 eV.The main peaks at around 398.4 and 399.4 eV are ascribed to sp 2 hybridized aromatic N bonded to carbon atoms in the form of CQN-C and the tertiary N bonded to carbon atoms (N-(C) 3 ).The peak at 400.5 eV can be assigned to N-H, and the weakest peak at 403.9 eV is attributed to p-excitations. 25 In Fig. 3d, four characteristic peaks are presented at binding energies of 70.9, 72.7, 74.4 and 75.8 eV for Pt1.0.The two peaks emerging at binding energies of 70.9 and 74.4 eV correspond to Pt 4f 7/2 and Pt 4f 5/2 , respectively, which indicate that the partial Pt deposited on the g-C 3 N 4 is metallic. 32,33The peaks appearing at 72.7 and 75.8 eV correspond to Pt 4f 7/2 and Pt 4f 5/2 of Pt 2 , respectively, implying that partial Pt was not completely reduced into metallic Pt in the reduction reaction. 34 The specific surface areas and porous structures of Pt0 and Pt1.0 were investigated by nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms.Fig. 4 presents the nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms and the corresponding pore-size distribution curves (inset) of the Pt0 and Pt1.0 samples.According to Brunauer-Deming-Deming-Teller (BDDT) classification, 35,36 the isotherms of all the samples are of type IV, indicating the presence of mesopores (2-50 nm). 37,38urther observation indicates that the isotherms of Pt0 shift up in contrast to Pt1.0 in all relative pressure ranges, suggesting Pt0 with higher surface areas and larger pore volume.The hysteresis loops of the Pt0 and Pt1.0 samples are of type H3, reflecting the existence of slit-like mesopores due to the aggregation of plate-like particles.This also agrees well with the observed morphology in the TEM images (Fig. 2). 39The pore size distribution curves (inset) calculated from nitrogen desorption isotherms by the BJH method show that the range of pore diameter is 2-120 nm.Fig. 4 (inset) shows that the Pt1.0 sample has less mesopores and smaller pore volume, because some mesopores were sealed with Pt or other chemical reactants in the process of Pt deposition and NaBH 4 -reduction. 40Table 1 lists the BET surface areas, pore volumes and the average pore diameter of all samples, indicating that the BET surface areas, pore volumes and the average pore diameter of the Pt0, Pt0.25, Pt0.5, Pt0.75, Pt1.0 and Pt2.0 samples almost remain unchanged due to the low Pt loading amount. The electronic structure of the as-prepared g-C 3 N 4 -Pt nanocomposites (Pt0, Pt0.25, Pt0.5, Pt0.75, Pt1.0 and Pt2.0) was measured by UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy.For the pure g-C 3 N 4 (Fig. 5), the absorbance abruptly increases at a wavelength shorter than ca.455 nm, which can be ascribed to the intrinsic bandgap of g-C 3 N 4 .The corresponding bandgap is about 2.7 eV, which is in line with the reported value of g-C 3 N 4 in the literature. 41,42The absorption edge of the composites does not change with the Pt introduction.This also indicates that the Pt is only supported on the surface of g-C 3 N 4 and not incorporated into the lattice of g-C 3 N 4 , which is consistent with the above XRD results.Further observation indicates that the background absorption in the visible-light region increases with increasing Pt content, which is in agreement with the color of the sample changing from yellow to gray (see insets in Fig. 5).This is due to the absorbance of black Pt NPs. 33e color change of the samples from Pt0 to Pt1.0 and Pt2.0 also further confirms the presence of metallic Pt NPs in the composite sample. Fig. 6 reveals the comparison of FT-IR spectra of pure g-C 3 N 4 (Pt0) and the g-C 3 N 4 -Pt composite (Pt1.0).No great difference can be found in the spectra of two samples.All absorption bands are similar to the IR features of the pure g-C 3 N 4 found in the previous reports. 43,44The strong absorption peaks at 1635, 1570, 1404, 1325 and 1243 cm A1 are attributed to the characteristic stretching modes of C-N heterocycles.The typical breathing mode of the tri-s-triazine units at 806 cm A1 can also be found in the spectra. 45The absorption band at 883 cm A1 can be assigned to the deformation mode of N-H. 46The broad bands at around the 3200 cm A1 region can be attributed to the adsorbed H 2 O molecules and N-H vibration of the uncondensed amine groups. 47he peak at 2380 cm A1 observed in two samples is due to the adsorbed CO 2 from the atmosphere. 41No other peaks can be found in the spectrum of Pt1.0 assigned to the Pt bonded to other elements.This appears to coincide with the previous XRD results. Control experiments indicated that no hydrocarbon compounds including CH 4 , CH 3 OH and HCHO were detected in the absence of either a photocatalyst or irradiation, suggesting that catalysts and light irradiation were two indispensable factors for photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 , and production of hydrocarbon compounds.To further understand the photocatalytic reduction mechanism of CO 2 to hydrocarbon compounds and to exclude possibilities of contamination from pure g-C 3 N 4 and the g-C 3 N 4 -Pt composite, further control experiment was performed.The Pt1.0 composite sample or Pt0 itself was illuminated without introducing CO 2 as the carbon source, where N 2 was used as the carrier gas.If there was any reactive residual carbon in the prepared catalysts, it would react with protons (H ) or H 2 generated from competitive water splitting to form hydrocarbon fuels.However, no hydrocarbon compounds were found, indicating that hydrocarbon compounds were not obtained from component carbon or other carbon contamination in our samples.This is also in good agreement with our recently reported results.2b In this study, CO 2 was in situ produced by the reaction of NaHCO 3 and HCl as the carbon source, and the hydrogen source was provided by H 2 O in the HCl aqueous solution.The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 was performed at atmospheric pressure and under simulated solar irradiation for 4 h.It is shown in Fig. 7 that the main products of the photocatalytic reaction of CO 2 are CH 4 , CH 3 OH and HCHO.And other products such as oxygen and carbon monoxide can also be detected using the gas chromatograph equipped with a TCD.No hydrogen is detected.Since the main products (CH 4 , CH 3 OH and HCHO) are important industrial resources and fuels, this work mainly focuses on the yield and the generated sequence of the above main products and the effect of Pt content on photocatalytic activity and selectivity of g-C 3 N 4 . For the pure g-C 3 N 4 (Fig. 7a), CH 3 OH is the main product under the UV-visible light irradiation, CH 4 and HCHO can only be detected by the GC-2014 after 3 h.It is then concluded that CH 3 OH is firstly produced in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.Fig. 7b (Pt0.25)shows that the CH 3 OH is firstly generated, with the appearance of CH 4 and HCHO after 2 h and 3 h.The yield of CH 3 OH decreased after 2 h when CH 4 and HCHO can be detected.It is shown in Fig. 7c (Pt0.5) that CH 4 and HCHO can be found after 2 h and the yield of CH 3 OH increases continuously in 4 h.Upon increasing the Pt amount in the composite to 0.75 wt (Fig. 7d), CH 4 and CH 3 OH can be detected after 1 h irradiation and HCHO appears after 2 h.And the yield of CH 4 becomes comparable with that of CH 3 OH after 4 h, indicating that the generation rate of CH 4 increases faster in comparison with CH 3 OH.For the Pt1.0 sample (Fig. 7e), CH 4 , CH 3 OH and HCHO were detected after 1 h irradiation, suggesting that the three products were generated at the same time.Surprisingly, the yield of CH 4 is larger than that of CH 3 OH after 3 h.However, upon further increasing the Pt amount in the composite to 2.0 wt (Pt2.0),HCHO can only be detected after 3 h of irradiation and the yields of CH 4 and CH 3 OH are lower than Pt1.0 (Fig. 7f), which illustrates that the activity of Pt2.0 is inferior to Pt1.0. It is clearly seen from Fig. 8 that the yield of CH 4 increases along with the content of Pt deposited on the g-C 3 N 4 increasing from 0 to 1.0 wt.And the yields of CH 3 OH and HCHO increase upon increasing Pt content from 0 to 0.75 wt on the g-C 3 N 4 .Therefore, the content of Pt is a key influencing factor for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction on the g-C 3 N 4 -Pt catalyst.Fig. 7 also shows that the generated rates of all products become decreased or leveled off after 4 h of continuous irradiation under UV-visible light. Photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 is a multiple-electron step, which involves photoexcited electron and hole generation as well as transfer, C-O bond breaking, C-H and O-H bond formation.Thermodynamically, one CO 2 molecule needs 8, 6 and 4 e A to be converted into CH 4 , CH 3 OH and HCHO, respectively (as shown in eqn (1-4)). 11,13,48While the photoexcited holes react with adsorbed water to produce oxygen (eqn ( 5)). 49,50The generated oxygen tends to react with the products to generate CO 2 and H 2 O, resulting in the observed decrease in the generation rate of products.At the same time, CH 3 OH might be oxidized to HCHO by generating oxygen in the closed system, contributing to a decreased generation rate of CH 3 OH. CO 2 4H 4e A -HCHO H 2 O (4) The deposition of Pt on the g-C 3 N 4 is a key factor for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 , which influences the yield and the generation rate of products.The metal Pt is a good catalyst for many oxidation and reduction reactions. 51In this work, the Pt is a cocatalyst which facilitates the interfacial electron transfer from g-C 3 N 4 to Pt NPs and prevents the recombination of photoexcited electron-hole pairs.So upon increasing the content of Pt from 0 to 1 wt, the contact area of g-C 3 N 4 and Pt NPs increased.Thus, more electrons transferred and gathered on the surface of the Pt NPs to react with CO 2 and H 2 O to convert them into hydrocarbon fuels. 52As can be seen from Fig. 8, the evolution of CH 3 OH and HCHO increases as the Pt deposited on the g-C 3 N 4 increases from 0 to 0.75 wt, but the yield decreases upon introduction of more Pt (above 1.0 wt).Such a tendency is ascribed to the simultaneous evolution and oxidation decomposition of HCHO under light irradiation. 26The Pt NPs deposited on the surface of g-C 3 N 4 can also lower the overpotential, as well as promote the electron transfer for the CO 2 reduction. 53,54o further confirm the above suggested photocatalytic mechanism, the transient photocurrent responses of the Pt0, Pt1.0 and Pt2.0 electrodes were monitored by using typical switch on-off cycles of irradiation.Fig. 9 shows a comparison of photocurrent-time (I-t) curves of the Pt0, Pt1.0 and Pt2.0 samples with typical switch on-off cycles of intermittent visible light irradiation at a bias potential of 0.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl.The photocurrent responded quickly in three electrodes when the samples were exposed to the visible light irradiation, and the photocurrent value gradually decreased to zero as soon as the irradiation of light was switched off, which displayed good reproducibility of the samples.The completely reversible phenomenon of photoresponsivity indicated that most of the photogenerated electrons were transported to the back contact across the sample to produce photocurrent under visible light irradiation. 23,55or the Pt0 sample, the photocurrent response rapidly boosts and slowly decreases to reach a constant value as the irradiation of light is switched on.While the photocurrent curve of Pt1.0 has an obvious photocurrent spike at the initial time of irradiation.After the spike current is obtained, the photocurrent value continuously decreases to a constant current with time.The photocurrent value decay indicates that the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs occurs in the process of irradiation.The holes accumulating on the surface of the samples (Pt0, Pt1.0 and Pt2.0) competitively recombine with electrons from the conduction band rather than being trapped or captured by reduced species in the electrolyte, which leads to the photocurrent decay. 56When the irradiation is switched off, the photocurrent values of the Pt0 and Pt1.0 samples decrease gradually to zero due to the charge carriers released from the traps.This indicates that many traps existing in the g-C 3 N 4 and the Pt NPs could separate and store the photogenerated electrons, reducing the recombination rate of the photogenerated electrons and holes and enhancing the value of photocurrent. 56erefore, the photocurrent value of Pt1.0 is higher than that of Pt0 because the recombination rate of electron-hole pairs of the former is lower than that of the latter, thus causing the enhancement of the photocatalytic reduction rate.In contrast, for the Pt2.0 sample, its photocurrent value is smaller than that of the Pt1.0 sample.This is because Pt overload possibly shields the light absorption of the Pt2.0 sample and becomes the recombination center of photogenerated electrons and holes.Further observation indicates that when light is switched off, the photocurrent of the Pt2.0 sample decreases more rapidly than other two samples, implying that overloaded Pt NPs possibly become the conductor of photogenerated electrons. To verify the above explanation, the PL analysis of the Pt0, Pt1.0 and Pt2.0 samples was performed.Generally, PL emission is from the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes, so PL intensity is used to compare the fate of photogenerated charge carriers.The stronger the PL peak intensity, the higher the recombination efficiency is. 57Fig. 10 presents the PL spectra of the Pt0, Pt1.0 and Pt2.0 samples.As can be seen, the shape of PL spectra of Pt1.0 and Pt2.0 is similar to that of Pt0.The PL emission peak at around 460 nm, which is very close to the absorption of g-C 3 N 4 , is ascribed to the band-band PL phenomenon. 14However, the peak intensity of Pt1.0 and Pt2.0 is obviously lower than that of Pt0, indicating that the loading of Pt greatly reduces the recombination of photogenerated charge carriers.This is because the photogenerated electrons can transfer to Pt NPs, thus reducing the recombination of photogenerated charge carriers.Particularly, the PL peak intensity of Pt1.0 is the lowest among three samples, also implying Pt1.0 with the highest photocatalytic activity. 58"}, {"llm generation": "simulated solar irradiation", "source": "Graphitic carbon nitride g-C 3 N 4 was synthesized by directly heating thiourea at 550 1C and a certain amount of Pt was deposited on g-C 3 N 4 to form g-C 3 N 4 -Pt nanocomposites, which were used as catalysts for photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 under simulated solar irradiation.", "context": "Graphitic carbon nitride g-C 3 N 4 was synthesized by directly heating thiourea at 550 1C and a certain amount of Pt was deposited on g-C 3 N 4 to form g-C 3 N 4 -Pt nanocomposites, which were used as catalysts for photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 under simulated solar irradiation.The content of Pt displayed a significant influence on the activity and selectivity of g-C 3 N 4 for photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 into CH 4 , CH 3 OH and HCHO.The Pt NPs were shown to be an effective cocatalyst, which not only influenced the selectivity of the product generation, but also affected the photoactivity of the g-C 3 N 4 .The yields of CH 4 and CH 3 OH increased upon increasing the content of Pt deposited on the g-C 3 N 4 from 0 to 1 wt, and the yield of HCHO increased as the Pt content increased from 0 to 0.75 wt but decreased when more Pt is deposited.What's more, CH 4 and HCHO can be generated more quickly upon increasing the Pt loading from 0 to 1 wt.The Pt acted as a cocatalyst which could facilitate electron transfer and enrich more photogenerated electrons on its surface for photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .At the same time, Pt also acts as a catalyst to promote the oxidation of the HCHO product.The transient photocurrent responses further confirm the proposed mechanism of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.This work not only indicates that the photoactivity and selectivity of g-C 3 N 4 for CO 2 reduction can be mediated by a small amount of deposited Pt NPs, but also shows that CO 2 can be easily converted into valuable hydrocarbon solar fuels at ambient temperature and pressure.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained on a D/Max-RB X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku, Japan), under Cu Ka radiation at a scan rate (2y) of 0.051 s A1 .The accelerating voltage and applied current were 40 kV and 80 mA, respectively.Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution TEM (HRTEM) analysis were conducted on a Tecnai G 2 F20 S-TWIN microscope at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV.X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were done by using an ultra-high-vacuum VG ESCALAB 210 electron spectrometer equipped with a multichannel detector.The spectrum was excited by Mg Ka radiation of two anodes in the constant analyzer energy mode and operating at 200 W.All the binding energies were referenced to the C 1s peak at 285.0 eV of the surface adventitious carbon.UV-visible absorbance spectra were obtained by using the die-pressed disk sample and a UV-visible spectrophotometer (UV-2550, SHIMADZU, Japan), in which BaSO 4 was used as the reflectance standard.Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR) of the samples were evaluated using an IR Affiinity-1 FTIR spectrometer which used conventional KBr pellets in the range of 4000-500 cm A1 at room temperature.The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface area (S BET ) of powder was recorded by using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 nitrogen adsorption apparatus (USA).All of the samples were degassed at 180 1C before measurement.The pore size distributions were determined using desorption data by the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method.The BET surface area was determined by a multipoint BET method using the adsorption data in the relative pressure (P/P 0 ) range of 0.05-0.25.Photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra were used to investigate the fate of photogenerated electrons and holes in the samples, and were measured at room temperature on an F-7000 Fluorescence Spectrophotometer (Hitachi, Japan).The excitation wavelength is 380 nm, the scanning speed is 1200 nm min A1 , and the photomultiplier tube (PMT) voltage is 700 V.The width of both the excitation slit and the emission slit was 1.0 nm.
