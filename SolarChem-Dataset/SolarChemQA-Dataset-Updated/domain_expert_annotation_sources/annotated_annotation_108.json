Preparation of PbS QD sensitized Cu/TiO 2 photocatalysts Cupric nitrate trihydrate (0.152 g) was dissolved in 5 ml deionized water, and then added in drop wise fashion to 2.0 g TiO 2 to form a wet paste.This paste was evaporated to dryness on a hotplate at 120 C, calcined in air for 3 h at 400 C, and then reduced using 1 H 2 in Ar for 8 h at 250 C. The final product is a gray powder which is 2 Cu by weight. To minimize air exposure of PbS QDs, the experimental procedure was carried out in a N 2 glove box as much as possible.PbS QDs in toluene were cleaned by precipitation using methanol and redissolved in toluene.This cleaning process was repeated one more time to further remove free capping molecules in the solution.The cleaned PbS QDs were dried under vacuum and then redispersed in toluene inside a glove box.30 mg of Cu/TiO 2 was dispersed in 10 ml 0.14 M 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) in N 2 -purged acetonitrile and stirred gently for 24 h.The powder was then rinsed with excess amounts of acetonitrile and dried under vacuum for 30 min.10 ml of PbS QD in toluene was then mixed with the dried, MPA treated Cu/TiO 2 and kept in the dark inside the glove box for 24 h.The solution was centrifuged and the powder was rinsed with toluene to remove any PbS QDs that were not attached to the surface of Cu/TiO 2 .By controlling the PbS QD concentration, the ratio between PbS QDs and Cu/TiO 2 can be adjusted.In the photocatalysis experiments reported here, a molar ratio of 1 : 1 PbS/TiO 2 was used (the average diameter of the TiO 2 is 20 nm).Finally, to remove excess organics and improve electronic coupling between the sensitizer and TiO 2 , the dried PbS/Cu/TiO 2 powder was first treated with 1 M hydrazine in ethanol in the glove box for 45 min, then rinsed with large amounts of ethanol and subsequently heated gently to 70 C under vacuum for 30 min. A gas-tight photocatalysis cell was constructed using a stainless steel spacer (MDC Vacuum Products) with conflat flange components and fitted with two inlet/outlet valves, one gas chromatography (GC) sampling port (HP 5890) connected via Swagelok fittings, and one UV quartz viewport; the opposite side was sealed with a blank conflat cover.A watch glass was placed at the bottom of the photocatalysis cell, on which catalyst samples were loaded for photocatalysis reaction.After a new septum was placed in the sampling port and a catalyst sample was loaded, the photocatalysis cell was purged with CO 2 bubbled through deionized water for 15 min.The photocatalysis cell was subsequently irradiated through the quartz viewport using light from a 300 W Xe arc lamp (Newport), fitted with a manual shutter and an optical filter holder.Various longpass filters were used to select wavelengths of illumination (Edmund Optics UV-vis filter kits 47-398, 47-399 and vis-NIR filter kit 47-400). GC analysis of photoreduction products was performed on a Perkin Elmer Clarus 600 Gas Chromatograph using a heated sample inlet.Sample detection was achieved using both a thermal conductivity detector and a flame ionization detector with methanizer, joined in sequence.Samples were injected manually using a 5 ml gas-tight syringe.The photocatalysis experiments with the active catalysts were repeated three times under the same reaction conditions and the variation of the CO 2 conversion rate was found to be 20. XPS was used to determine the surface composition of the PbS/ Cu/TiO 2 powders as well as the oxidation state of PbS.The powders were analyzed using a PHI 5600ci instrument, by placing them in a small well machined into the surface of the sample holder.Monochromatic Al Ka X-rays (1486.6 eV) were used and the pass energy of the analyzer was set at 58.7 eV.The insulating powders required charge neutralization with a lowenergy electron gun.Binding energies were referenced to adventitious carbon at 284.6 eV.The Pb 4f spectrum was curve fitted using XPSPEAK software after subtracting a Shirley background.The peak parameters used for the curve-fitting analysis were a combination of average values for peak positions taken from the literature and lineshapes resulting from optimizing the curve-fitting results."}, {"llm generation": "PbS/Cu/TiO2 photocatalysts", "source": "Characterization of PbS/Cu/TiO 2 photocatalysts Three different sizes of PbS QDs (diameters 3, 4, and 5 nm) were used to sensitize TiO 2 decorated with Cu co-catalysts.", "context": "Characterization of PbS/Cu/TiO 2 photocatalysts Three different sizes of PbS QDs (diameters 3, 4, and 5 nm) were used to sensitize TiO 2 decorated with Cu co-catalysts.High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images of the catalysts indicate that the PbS QDs are attached to the surface of Cu/TiO 2 particles (Fig. 1b).In many cases, an orientation relationship between PbS QDs and TiO 2 anatase have been observed of the type 111 PbS FCC k101 TiO 2 anatase which is presumably due to the similar d-spacings of these two sets of planes.It is unclear if the crystallographic relationship between the sensitizer QDs and the TiO 2 is important for electron transfer and overall catalyst performance.The Cu co-catalysts are more difficult to identify in TEM and HRTEM images, but regions that can be indexed to Cu in contact with TiO 2 anatase have been observed with HRTEM.Elemental analysis using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) also confirms the existence of Cu metal in addition to the presence of Pb, S, Ti, and O (data not shown).The diffuse reflectance spectra (Fig. 1c) of the heterostructured photocatalysts further demonstrate that the optical properties of PbS QDs are preserved in the heterostructured catalysts.The first exciton peak of 3 nm PbS QDs at 735 nm is obscured by the Cu/ TiO 2 absorption and therefore not as distinguishable as for the other two sizes of PbS QDs. With the structural and optical properties of the PbS QD sensitized TiO 2 catalysts characterized, we examined their activity for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 in the presence of H 2 O. GC analysis indicates that the main products of all the reactions reported include CO, CH 4 , C 2 H 6 and H 2 .Control experiments on PbS QDs or Cu/TiO 2 alone find no photocatalytic activity under visible light illumination, illustrating that the formation of a heterostructure between the QD and the Cu-loaded TiO 2 is required for activity.The highest temperature measured in the catalyst bed was 38 C under the white light illumination of a Xe arc lamp suggesting that thermal contributions to the catalytic activity are absent.To further test for thermal effects, control experiments were run by loading a cell with PbS QD sensitized Cu/TiO 2 , CO 2 , and H 2 O and placing it in a dark oven at 50 C yielding only trace amounts of CH 4 and CO, demonstrating that the activity seen in our reactions definitely results from the photoexcitation of the heterostructure. Fig. 2 shows the normalized CO 2 conversion rate as a function of illumination wavelengths for three different sized PbS QDs sensitized Cu/TiO 2 photocatalysts.The optical filters used are a longpass type which allow longer wavelengths of light to transmit, but block higher energy photons.As expected, the threshold for photocatalytic activity shifts to longer wavelength for larger PbS QDs, verifying the central role played by PbS QDs.For 5 nm PbS QD sensitized Cu/TiO 2 , significant photocatalytic activity is seen at wavelengths as low in energy as 610 nm.Reports clearly demonstrating the visible light photoreduction of CO 2 are exceptionally rare and this activity appears to be unique for the low energy orange-red edge of the spectrum illustrating the utility of our approach for harnessing larger portions of the solar spectrum for CO 2 management applications. 2For all three sizes of QDs, the threshold energy for activity is larger than the bandgap of the PbS QD sensitizers (Fig. 2 inset). 17For the largest PbS QD used in our experiment, the bottom of the conduction band of PbS QD is below that of TiO 2 (Fig. 1a), and therefore band-edge excitation is not expected to directly lead to charge injection from the 5 nm QDs into TiO 2 . 13,14Photoexcitation to higher energy states in the conduction band is therefore necessary for charge separation to occur between the 5 nm PbS QDs and TiO 2 .The threshold is 2 eV for this sample and about 2.2 times higher than the bandgap of the 5 nm PbS QD (0.91 eV).A similar observation has been reported for 10 nm PbS QDs (E g 14 0.85 eV) which need an excitation of 700 nm photons or 1.77 eV (2.1 times E g ) to initiate electron injection into TiO 2 . 16Our results further demonstrate the strong electronic interaction between PbS QD excited states and the TiO 2 conduction band 16 such that charge separation is enabled by above bandgap excitation for large PbS QDs where the band alignment with TiO 2 is not favorable for charge injection under band-edge excitation.For the two smaller sized PbS QD sensitized Cu/TiO 2 photocatalytsts, relatively low light absorption at the first exciton peak combined with the overall low CO 2 conversion yield of the TiO 2 catalysts may account for the lack of discernable photocatalytic activity under direct band-edge excitation.At higher excitation energies, this issue is overcome as light absorption significantly increases and photoexcited electrons cool to the bottom of the conduction band and subsequently inject into TiO 2 because of the favorable band alignment for these two sizes of PbS QDs. 13,14n addition, electrons in higher excited states in PbS QDs can also directly inject into the TiO 2 conduction band to initiate the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 . 16o evaluate the effectiveness of PbS QD sensitization, we compare the total CO 2 conversion yield under white light irradiation.Fig. 3 demonstrates that all of the PbS QD sensitized TiO 2 catalysts are at least 3 times as active as the Cu co-catalysts loaded commercial Evonik AeroxideO TiO 2 P25 under the same reaction conditions.In particular, the 4 nm PbS QD sensitized Cu/TiO 2 catalyst shows the highest CO 2 conversion yield of 1.71 mmol g A1 h A1 (0.82 mmol g A1 h A1 CO, 0.58 mmol g A1 h A1 CH 4 , and 0.31 mmol g A1 h A1 C 2 H 6 ), 18 which is 5 times the CO 2 reduction products generation rate of Cu/TiO 2 without the use of the sensitizers.Additionally, the CO 2 conversion rates for the 3, 4 and 5 nm PbS QD sensitized Cu/TiO 2 catalysts under visible light irradiation (l 400 nm for 3 nm PbS QD sensitized catalyst, and l 420 nm for 4 and 5 nm PbS QD sensitized catalyst) are 0.45, 1.12, and 0.60 mmol g A1 h A1 , respectively.All of these yields are higher than that of the Cu/TiO 2 without sensitizers under white light irradiation (0.32 mmol g A1 h A1 ).These results illustrate the general utility of the QDs for sensitization across UV and visible spectral ranges.Furthermore, we expect that the CO 2 conversion efficiency of the PbS QD sensitized Cu/ TiO 2 heterostructured photocatalyst can be substantially improved by, for example, incorporating highly active enzymemodified TiO 2 nanoparticles. 8t is interesting to note that the 4 nm PbS QD sensitized TiO 2 shows the highest CO 2 conversion rate among the 3 sizes of PbS QDs investigated.This can be understood by considering that the overall efficiency should result from a combination of photon absorption and the charge separation yield.The smallest PbS QDs are expected to exhibit the fastest electron injection rates. 13,19However, the 3 nm PbS QD sensitized Cu/TiO 2 sample only utilizes photons with wavelengths shorter than 515 nm (Fig. 2).In contrast, the 5 nm PbS QDs can enable the TiO 2 catalyst to become active at up to 610 nm despite having the lowest charge separation yield among the 3 sizes of PbS QDs. 13,19b19b The balance of these two competing factors results in the observation that 4 nm PbS QD sensitized Cu/TiO 2 catalysts show the highest CO 2 conversion yield under white light illumination.It would be important to more quantitatively determine the efficiency differences of utilizing photons by different sized PbS QDs.However, this would require the accurate measurement of the number of photons absorbed by PbS QDs in the heterostructured catalysts that are directly involved in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 , which is beyond the scope of the present work. The effect of the sizes of PbS QDs on the photocatalytic activity can be further complicated by the fact that smaller QDs with faster electron injection times also have faster charge recombination dynamics between the injected electrons and the oxidized PbS QDs, presumably due to the reduced distance between the electrons and holes for smaller QDs. 13 Fully exploring the various effects of the PbS QD sizes on the overall photocatalytic activity can therefore present additional opportunities to optimize the CO 2 photoreduction performance. The photocatalysts become inactive after 8 h of continuous visible light irradiation, similar to what was reported previously for CdSe 11 and PbSe 17 sensitized TiO 2 catalysts.The deactivation is presumably due to the photo-oxidation of the small bandgap semiconductor sensitizers, a well-known phenomenon especially in the presence of H 2 O. 20 Specifically, the photo-oxidation of CdSe QDs on TiO 2 surfaces has been reported. 21To further verify this assumption and better understand the fate of the QD sensitizers, XPS was used to probe the oxidation state change in PbS QDs.As shown in Fig. 4, the Pb 4f core-level spectra reveal the contribution from unoxidized PbS and its oxidation products. 22,23Each peak is also a superposition of two components attributed to the contribution from the Pb in the volume of the QD and Pb atoms on the QD surface. 24As reported previously, the higher-energy features in the XPS spectra are assigned to Pb-O adducts in the form of PbO or Pb(OH) 2 . 22,23Approximately 18 of the Pb in the PbS QDs is partially oxidized before exposure to light (Fig. 4a).The sensitivity of PbS QDs to air has been reported 23 and it is therefore not surprising that the PbS QDs are more prone to oxidation after removing the capping molecules in our heterostructured photocatalysts.After 8 h of phototcatalytic reaction under l 420 nm illumination, the amount of Pb-O adducts significantly increases and up to 80 of the Pb in the QDs is oxidized (Fig. 4b).The observed photooxidation of PbS QDs is consistent with previous studies of CdSe photodegradation on TiO 2 surface 21 and agrees with our proposed deactivation mechanism resulting from the accumulation of photo-generated holes in the QDs valence band in a system which (currently) lacks hole scavengers to regenerate the oxidized QDs. It is worth emphasizing that the operation principle of semiconductor QD sensitized TiO 2 is thermodynamically sound.In our system, photoexcitation of the PbS QDs generates charge carriers which are separated at the PbS/TiO 2 interface when electrons are injected into the conduction band of TiO 2 .This electron injection subsequently leads to the reduction of CO 2 on the TiO 2 surface.The photogenerated holes, however, are left in the valence band of PbS QDs because they lack the correct energetics to oxidize water, a fact which has never been disputed by our group.The accumulated holes eventually result in the oxidation of PbS to form PbSO 3 , PbO, Pb(OH) 2 , etc., as shown by our XPS measurements and similar to the photo-oxidation processes reported for other small bandgap QDs. 20,21,23The transition-metal complexes currently under investigation as CO 2 photo-reduction catalysts face similar issues with their inability to oxidize water directly, requiring the use of tertiary amines as sacrificial hole scavengers.2b The use of suitable hole scavengers is currently being investigated in our group to help eliminate the deactivation of these QD sensitizers by the positively charged hole. To further comment on the operation principle of these catalysts, we point out that we are able to achieve the photoreduction of CO 2 using either H 2 O vapor or H 2 gas as the H-atom source.The main product is CO when H 2 is used, which is similar to a previous observation in the literature. 25The precise reaction mechanism for this system is still under investigation, but current and past data on the photophysics of these heterostructures clearly indicate that the mechanisms involving H 2 O oxidation by photogenerated holes do not apply.As the valence bands of the QDs are known to be too negative to initiate H 2 O oxidation, this mechanism has never been a viable physical process for explaining the reactivity of this system."}, {"llm generation": "Cu/TiO2", "source": "We extend the photocatalytic activity of Cu/TiO 2 for the reduction of CO 2 to orange part of the visible spectrum (610 nm) using PbS QD sensitizers.", "context": "We extend the photocatalytic activity of Cu/TiO 2 for the reduction of CO 2 to orange part of the visible spectrum (610 nm) using PbS QD sensitizers.The observed CO 2 conversion rates are significantly higher than the non-sensitized Cu/TiO 2 .The photocatalytic activity threshold exhibits a clear dependence on the size of the PbS QD sensitizers.For the 3 sizes of the PbS QDs studied here, the threshold energy is 2E g , indicating strong electronic coupling between the QDs and TiO 2 .The middle sized 4 nm PbS QD sensitized Cu/TiO 2 shows the highest CO 2 conversion rate, due to the combination of light absorption and charge separation properties.XPS investigation reveals that the deactivation of the heterostructured catalyst after prolonged light excitation results from the photo-oxidation of PbS QDs.

With the structural and optical properties of the PbS QD sensitized TiO 2 catalysts characterized, we examined their activity for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 in the presence of H 2 O. GC analysis indicates that the main products of all the reactions reported include CO, CH 4 , C 2 H 6 and H 2 .Control experiments on PbS QDs or Cu/TiO 2 alone find no photocatalytic activity under visible light illumination, illustrating that the formation of a heterostructure between the QD and the Cu-loaded TiO 2 is required for activity.The highest temperature measured in the catalyst bed was 38 C under the white light illumination of a Xe arc lamp suggesting that thermal contributions to the catalytic activity are absent.To further test for thermal effects, control experiments were run by loading a cell with PbS QD sensitized Cu/TiO 2 , CO 2 , and H 2 O and placing it in a dark oven at 50 C yielding only trace amounts of CH 4 and CO, demonstrating that the activity seen in our reactions definitely results from the photoexcitation of the heterostructure. Fig. 2 shows the normalized CO 2 conversion rate as a function of illumination wavelengths for three different sized PbS QDs sensitized Cu/TiO 2 photocatalysts.The optical filters used are a longpass type which allow longer wavelengths of light to transmit, but block higher energy photons.As expected, the threshold for photocatalytic activity shifts to longer wavelength for larger PbS QDs, verifying the central role played by PbS QDs.For 5 nm PbS QD sensitized Cu/TiO 2 , significant photocatalytic activity is seen at wavelengths as low in energy as 610 nm.Reports clearly demonstrating the visible light photoreduction of CO 2 are exceptionally rare and this activity appears to be unique for the low energy orange-red edge of the spectrum illustrating the utility of our approach for harnessing larger portions of the solar spectrum for CO 2 management applications. 2For all three sizes of QDs, the threshold energy for activity is larger than the bandgap of the PbS QD sensitizers (Fig. 2 inset). 17For the largest PbS QD used in our experiment, the bottom of the conduction band of PbS QD is below that of TiO 2 (Fig. 1a), and therefore band-edge excitation is not expected to directly lead to charge injection from the 5 nm QDs into TiO 2 . 13,14Photoexcitation to higher energy states in the conduction band is therefore necessary for charge separation to occur between the 5 nm PbS QDs and TiO 2 .The threshold is 2 eV for this sample and about 2.2 times higher than the bandgap of the 5 nm PbS QD (0.91 eV).A similar observation has been reported for 10 nm PbS QDs (E g 14 0.85 eV) which need an excitation of 700 nm photons or 1.77 eV (2.1 times E g ) to initiate electron injection into TiO 2 . 16Our results further demonstrate the strong electronic interaction between PbS QD excited states and the TiO 2 conduction band 16 such that charge separation is enabled by above bandgap excitation for large PbS QDs where the band alignment with TiO 2 is not favorable for charge injection under band-edge excitation.For the two smaller sized PbS QD sensitized Cu/TiO 2 photocatalytsts, relatively low light absorption at the first exciton peak combined with the overall low CO 2 conversion yield of the TiO 2 catalysts may account for the lack of discernable photocatalytic activity under direct band-edge excitation.At higher excitation energies, this issue is overcome as light absorption significantly increases and photoexcited electrons cool to the bottom of the conduction band and subsequently inject into TiO 2 because of the favorable band alignment for these two sizes of PbS QDs. 13,14n addition, electrons in higher excited states in PbS QDs can also directly inject into the TiO 2 conduction band to initiate the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 . 16o evaluate the effectiveness of PbS QD sensitization, we compare the total CO 2 conversion yield under white light irradiation.Fig. 3 demonstrates that all of the PbS QD sensitized TiO 2 catalysts are at least 3 times as active as the Cu co-catalysts loaded commercial Evonik AeroxideO TiO 2 P25 under the same reaction conditions.In particular, the 4 nm PbS QD sensitized Cu/TiO 2 catalyst shows the highest CO 2 conversion yield of 1.71 mmol g A1 h A1 (0.82 mmol g A1 h A1 CO, 0.58 mmol g A1 h A1 CH 4 , and 0.31 mmol g A1 h A1 C 2 H 6 ), 18 which is 5 times the CO 2 reduction products generation rate of Cu/TiO 2 without the use of the sensitizers.Additionally, the CO 2 conversion rates for the 3, 4 and 5 nm PbS QD sensitized Cu/TiO 2 catalysts under visible light irradiation (l 400 nm for 3 nm PbS QD sensitized catalyst, and l 420 nm for 4 and 5 nm PbS QD sensitized catalyst) are 0.45, 1.12, and 0.60 mmol g A1 h A1 , respectively.All of these yields are higher than that of the Cu/TiO 2 without sensitizers under white light irradiation (0.32 mmol g A1 h A1 ).These results illustrate the general utility of the QDs for sensitization across UV and visible spectral ranges.Furthermore, we expect that the CO 2 conversion efficiency of the PbS QD sensitized Cu/ TiO 2 heterostructured photocatalyst can be substantially improved by, for example, incorporating highly active enzymemodified TiO 2 nanoparticles. 8t is interesting to note that the 4 nm PbS QD sensitized TiO 2 shows the highest CO 2 conversion rate among the 3 sizes of PbS QDs investigated.This can be understood by considering that the overall efficiency should result from a combination of photon absorption and the charge separation yield.The smallest PbS QDs are expected to exhibit the fastest electron injection rates. 13,19However, the 3 nm PbS QD sensitized Cu/TiO 2 sample only utilizes photons with wavelengths shorter than 515 nm (Fig. 2).In contrast, the 5 nm PbS QDs can enable the TiO 2 catalyst to become active at up to 610 nm despite having the lowest charge separation yield among the 3 sizes of PbS QDs. 13,19b19b The balance of these two competing factors results in the observation that 4 nm PbS QD sensitized Cu/TiO 2 catalysts show the highest CO 2 conversion yield under white light illumination.It would be important to more quantitatively determine the efficiency differences of utilizing photons by different sized PbS QDs.However, this would require the accurate measurement of the number of photons absorbed by PbS QDs in the heterostructured catalysts that are directly involved in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 , which is beyond the scope of the present work. The effect of the sizes of PbS QDs on the photocatalytic activity can be further complicated by the fact that smaller QDs with faster electron injection times also have faster charge recombination dynamics between the injected electrons and the oxidized PbS QDs, presumably due to the reduced distance between the electrons and holes for smaller QDs. 13 Fully exploring the various effects of the PbS QD sizes on the overall photocatalytic activity can therefore present additional opportunities to optimize the CO 2 photoreduction performance. The photocatalysts become inactive after 8 h of continuous visible light irradiation, similar to what was reported previously for CdSe 11 and PbSe 17 sensitized TiO 2 catalysts.The deactivation is presumably due to the photo-oxidation of the small bandgap semiconductor sensitizers, a well-known phenomenon especially in the presence of H 2 O. 20 Specifically, the photo-oxidation of CdSe QDs on TiO 2 surfaces has been reported. 21To further verify this assumption and better understand the fate of the QD sensitizers, XPS was used to probe the oxidation state change in PbS QDs.As shown in Fig. 4, the Pb 4f core-level spectra reveal the contribution from unoxidized PbS and its oxidation products. 22,23Each peak is also a superposition of two components attributed to the contribution from the Pb in the volume of the QD and Pb atoms on the QD surface. 24As reported previously, the higher-energy features in the XPS spectra are assigned to Pb-O adducts in the form of PbO or Pb(OH) 2 . 22,23Approximately 18 of the Pb in the PbS QDs is partially oxidized before exposure to light (Fig. 4a).The sensitivity of PbS QDs to air has been reported 23 and it is therefore not surprising that the PbS QDs are more prone to oxidation after removing the capping molecules in our heterostructured photocatalysts.After 8 h of phototcatalytic reaction under l 420 nm illumination, the amount of Pb-O adducts significantly increases and up to 80 of the Pb in the QDs is oxidized (Fig. 4b).The observed photooxidation of PbS QDs is consistent with previous studies of CdSe photodegradation on TiO 2 surface 21 and agrees with our proposed deactivation mechanism resulting from the accumulation of photo-generated holes in the QDs valence band in a system which (currently) lacks hole scavengers to regenerate the oxidized QDs. It is worth emphasizing that the operation principle of semiconductor QD sensitized TiO 2 is thermodynamically sound.In our system, photoexcitation of the PbS QDs generates charge carriers which are separated at the PbS/TiO 2 interface when electrons are injected into the conduction band of TiO 2 .This electron injection subsequently leads to the reduction of CO 2 on the TiO 2 surface.The photogenerated holes, however, are left in the valence band of PbS QDs because they lack the correct energetics to oxidize water, a fact which has never been disputed by our group.The accumulated holes eventually result in the oxidation of PbS to form PbSO 3 , PbO, Pb(OH) 2 , etc., as shown by our XPS measurements and similar to the photo-oxidation processes reported for other small bandgap QDs. 20,21,23The transition-metal complexes currently under investigation as CO 2 photo-reduction catalysts face similar issues with their inability to oxidize water directly, requiring the use of tertiary amines as sacrificial hole scavengers.2b The use of suitable hole scavengers is currently being investigated in our group to help eliminate the deactivation of these QD sensitizers by the positively charged hole. To further comment on the operation principle of these catalysts, we point out that we are able to achieve the photoreduction of CO 2 using either H 2 O vapor or H 2 gas as the H-atom source.The main product is CO when H 2 is used, which is similar to a previous observation in the literature. 25The precise reaction mechanism for this system is still under investigation, but current and past data on the photophysics of these heterostructures clearly indicate that the mechanisms involving H 2 O oxidation by photogenerated holes do not apply.As the valence bands of the QDs are known to be too negative to initiate H 2 O oxidation, this mechanism has never been a viable physical process for explaining the reactivity of this system."}], "light source": [{"llm generation": "UV-Vis", "source": "Under broad band illumination (UV-NIR), the PbS QDs enhance CO 2 photoreduction rates with TiO 2 by a factor of 5 in comparison to unsensitized photocatalysts.", "context": "The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 to value-added chemicals, such as CH 4 , is a promising carbon management approach which can generate revenue from chemical sales to offset the cost of implementing CO 2 capture technologies.To make photocatalytic conversion approaches efficient, economically practical, and industrially scalable, catalysts capable of utilizing visible and near infrared (IR) photons need to be developed.Here we investigate the sensitization of TiO 2 catalysts using PbS quantum dots (QDs) which lead to the size dependent photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 at frequencies ranging from the violet to the orange-red edge of the electromagnetic spectrum (l 420 to 610 nm).Under broad band illumination (UV-NIR), the PbS QDs enhance CO 2 photoreduction rates with TiO 2 by a factor of 5 in comparison to unsensitized photocatalysts.X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is used to investigate the deactivation mechanism of the QD sensitizers after prolonged photoexcitation.The synthesis, characterization, and catalytic testing of these PbS sensitized TiO 2 heterostructures will aid the development of more robust, visible light active photocatalysts for carbon management applications."}, {"llm generation": "UV-Vis", "source": "The photocatalysis cell was subsequently irradiated through the quartz viewport using light from a 300 W Xe arc lamp (Newport), fitted with a manual shutter and an optical filter holder.

Preparation of PbS QD sensitized Cu/TiO 2 photocatalysts Cupric nitrate trihydrate (0.152 g) was dissolved in 5 ml deionized water, and then added in drop wise fashion to 2.0 g TiO 2 to form a wet paste.This paste was evaporated to dryness on a hotplate at 120 C, calcined in air for 3 h at 400 C, and then reduced using 1 H 2 in Ar for 8 h at 250 C. The final product is a gray powder which is 2 Cu by weight. To minimize air exposure of PbS QDs, the experimental procedure was carried out in a N 2 glove box as much as possible.PbS QDs in toluene were cleaned by precipitation using methanol and redissolved in toluene.This cleaning process was repeated one more time to further remove free capping molecules in the solution.The cleaned PbS QDs were dried under vacuum and then redispersed in toluene inside a glove box.30 mg of Cu/TiO 2 was dispersed in 10 ml 0.14 M 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) in N 2 -purged acetonitrile and stirred gently for 24 h.The powder was then rinsed with excess amounts of acetonitrile and dried under vacuum for 30 min.10 ml of PbS QD in toluene was then mixed with the dried, MPA treated Cu/TiO 2 and kept in the dark inside the glove box for 24 h.The solution was centrifuged and the powder was rinsed with toluene to remove any PbS QDs that were not attached to the surface of Cu/TiO 2 .By controlling the PbS QD concentration, the ratio between PbS QDs and Cu/TiO 2 can be adjusted.In the photocatalysis experiments reported here, a molar ratio of 1 : 1 PbS/TiO 2 was used (the average diameter of the TiO 2 is 20 nm).Finally, to remove excess organics and improve electronic coupling between the sensitizer and TiO 2 , the dried PbS/Cu/TiO 2 powder was first treated with 1 M hydrazine in ethanol in the glove box for 45 min, then rinsed with large amounts of ethanol and subsequently heated gently to 70 C under vacuum for 30 min.

To further comment on the operation principle of these catalysts, we point out that we are able to achieve the photoreduction of CO 2 using either H 2 O vapor or H 2 gas as the H-atom source.The main product is CO when H 2 is used, which is similar to a previous observation in the literature. 25The precise reaction mechanism for this system is still under investigation, but current and past data on the photophysics of these heterostructures clearly indicate that the mechanisms involving H 2 O oxidation by photogenerated holes do not apply.As the valence bands of the QDs are known to be too negative to initiate H 2 O oxidation, this mechanism has never been a viable physical process for explaining the reactivity of this system."}, {"llm generation": "white light", "source": "The highest temperature measured in the catalyst bed was 38 C under the white light illumination of a Xe arc lamp suggesting that thermal contributions to the catalytic activity are absent.", "context": "Characterization of PbS/Cu/TiO 2 photocatalysts Three different sizes of PbS QDs (diameters 3, 4, and 5 nm) were used to sensitize TiO 2 decorated with Cu co-catalysts.High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images of the catalysts indicate that the PbS QDs are attached to the surface of Cu/TiO 2 particles (Fig. 1b).In many cases, an orientation relationship between PbS QDs and TiO 2 anatase have been observed of the type 111 PbS FCC k101 TiO 2 anatase which is presumably due to the similar d-spacings of these two sets of planes.It is unclear if the crystallographic relationship between the sensitizer QDs and the TiO 2 is important for electron transfer and overall catalyst performance.The Cu co-catalysts are more difficult to identify in TEM and HRTEM images, but regions that can be indexed to Cu in contact with TiO 2 anatase have been observed with HRTEM.Elemental analysis using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) also confirms the existence of Cu metal in addition to the presence of Pb, S, Ti, and O (data not shown).The diffuse reflectance spectra (Fig. 1c) of the heterostructured photocatalysts further demonstrate that the optical properties of PbS QDs are preserved in the heterostructured catalysts.The first exciton peak of 3 nm PbS QDs at 735 nm is obscured by the Cu/ TiO 2 absorption and therefore not as distinguishable as for the other two sizes of PbS QDs. With the structural and optical properties of the PbS QD sensitized TiO 2 catalysts characterized, we examined their activity for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 in the presence of H 2 O. GC analysis indicates that the main products of all the reactions reported include CO, CH 4 , C 2 H 6 and H 2 .Control experiments on PbS QDs or Cu/TiO 2 alone find no photocatalytic activity under visible light illumination, illustrating that the formation of a heterostructure between the QD and the Cu-loaded TiO 2 is required for activity.The highest temperature measured in the catalyst bed was 38 C under the white light illumination of a Xe arc lamp suggesting that thermal contributions to the catalytic activity are absent.To further test for thermal effects, control experiments were run by loading a cell with PbS QD sensitized Cu/TiO 2 , CO 2 , and H 2 O and placing it in a dark oven at 50 C yielding only trace amounts of CH 4 and CO, demonstrating that the activity seen in our reactions definitely results from the photoexcitation of the heterostructure. Fig. 2 shows the normalized CO 2 conversion rate as a function of illumination wavelengths for three different sized PbS QDs sensitized Cu/TiO 2 photocatalysts.The optical filters used are a longpass type which allow longer wavelengths of light to transmit, but block higher energy photons.As expected, the threshold for photocatalytic activity shifts to longer wavelength for larger PbS QDs, verifying the central role played by PbS QDs.For 5 nm PbS QD sensitized Cu/TiO 2 , significant photocatalytic activity is seen at wavelengths as low in energy as 610 nm.Reports clearly demonstrating the visible light photoreduction of CO 2 are exceptionally rare and this activity appears to be unique for the low energy orange-red edge of the spectrum illustrating the utility of our approach for harnessing larger portions of the solar spectrum for CO 2 management applications. 2For all three sizes of QDs, the threshold energy for activity is larger than the bandgap of the PbS QD sensitizers (Fig. 2 inset). 17For the largest PbS QD used in our experiment, the bottom of the conduction band of PbS QD is below that of TiO 2 (Fig. 1a), and therefore band-edge excitation is not expected to directly lead to charge injection from the 5 nm QDs into TiO 2 . 13,14Photoexcitation to higher energy states in the conduction band is therefore necessary for charge separation to occur between the 5 nm PbS QDs and TiO 2 .The threshold is 2 eV for this sample and about 2.2 times higher than the bandgap of the 5 nm PbS QD (0.91 eV).A similar observation has been reported for 10 nm PbS QDs (E g 14 0.85 eV) which need an excitation of 700 nm photons or 1.77 eV (2.1 times E g ) to initiate electron injection into TiO 2 . 16Our results further demonstrate the strong electronic interaction between PbS QD excited states and the TiO 2 conduction band 16 such that charge separation is enabled by above bandgap excitation for large PbS QDs where the band alignment with TiO 2 is not favorable for charge injection under band-edge excitation.For the two smaller sized PbS QD sensitized Cu/TiO 2 photocatalytsts, relatively low light absorption at the first exciton peak combined with the overall low CO 2 conversion yield of the TiO 2 catalysts may account for the lack of discernable photocatalytic activity under direct band-edge excitation.At higher excitation energies, this issue is overcome as light absorption significantly increases and photoexcited electrons cool to the bottom of the conduction band and subsequently inject into TiO 2 because of the favorable band alignment for these two sizes of PbS QDs. 13,14n addition, electrons in higher excited states in PbS QDs can also directly inject into the TiO 2 conduction band to initiate the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 . 16o evaluate the effectiveness of PbS QD sensitization, we compare the total CO 2 conversion yield under white light irradiation.Fig. 3 demonstrates that all of the PbS QD sensitized TiO 2 catalysts are at least 3 times as active as the Cu co-catalysts loaded commercial Evonik AeroxideO TiO 2 P25 under the same reaction conditions.In particular, the 4 nm PbS QD sensitized Cu/TiO 2 catalyst shows the highest CO 2 conversion yield of 1.71 mmol g A1 h A1 (0.82 mmol g A1 h A1 CO, 0.58 mmol g A1 h A1 CH 4 , and 0.31 mmol g A1 h A1 C 2 H 6 ), 18 which is 5 times the CO 2 reduction products generation rate of Cu/TiO 2 without the use of the sensitizers.Additionally, the CO 2 conversion rates for the 3, 4 and 5 nm PbS QD sensitized Cu/TiO 2 catalysts under visible light irradiation (l 400 nm for 3 nm PbS QD sensitized catalyst, and l 420 nm for 4 and 5 nm PbS QD sensitized catalyst) are 0.45, 1.12, and 0.60 mmol g A1 h A1 , respectively.All of these yields are higher than that of the Cu/TiO 2 without sensitizers under white light irradiation (0.32 mmol g A1 h A1 ).These results illustrate the general utility of the QDs for sensitization across UV and visible spectral ranges.Furthermore, we expect that the CO 2 conversion efficiency of the PbS QD sensitized Cu/ TiO 2 heterostructured photocatalyst can be substantially improved by, for example, incorporating highly active enzymemodified TiO 2 nanoparticles. 8t is interesting to note that the 4 nm PbS QD sensitized TiO 2 shows the highest CO 2 conversion rate among the 3 sizes of PbS QDs investigated.This can be understood by considering that the overall efficiency should result from a combination of photon absorption and the charge separation yield.The smallest PbS QDs are expected to exhibit the fastest electron injection rates. 13,19However, the 3 nm PbS QD sensitized Cu/TiO 2 sample only utilizes photons with wavelengths shorter than 515 nm (Fig. 2).In contrast, the 5 nm PbS QDs can enable the TiO 2 catalyst to become active at up to 610 nm despite having the lowest charge separation yield among the 3 sizes of PbS QDs. 13,19b19b The balance of these two competing factors results in the observation that 4 nm PbS QD sensitized Cu/TiO 2 catalysts show the highest CO 2 conversion yield under white light illumination.It would be important to more quantitatively determine the efficiency differences of utilizing photons by different sized PbS QDs.However, this would require the accurate measurement of the number of photons absorbed by PbS QDs in the heterostructured catalysts that are directly involved in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 , which is beyond the scope of the present work. The effect of the sizes of PbS QDs on the photocatalytic activity can be further complicated by the fact that smaller QDs with faster electron injection times also have faster charge recombination dynamics between the injected electrons and the oxidized PbS QDs, presumably due to the reduced distance between the electrons and holes for smaller QDs. 13 Fully exploring the various effects of the PbS QD sizes on the overall photocatalytic activity can therefore present additional opportunities to optimize the CO 2 photoreduction performance.

Preparation of PbS QD sensitized Cu/TiO 2 photocatalysts Cupric nitrate trihydrate (0.152 g) was dissolved in 5 ml deionized water, and then added in drop wise fashion to 2.0 g TiO 2 to form a wet paste.This paste was evaporated to dryness on a hotplate at 120 C, calcined in air for 3 h at 400 C, and then reduced using 1 H 2 in Ar for 8 h at 250 C. The final product is a gray powder which is 2 Cu by weight. To minimize air exposure of PbS QDs, the experimental procedure was carried out in a N 2 glove box as much as possible.PbS QDs in toluene were cleaned by precipitation using methanol and redissolved in toluene.This cleaning process was repeated one more time to further remove free capping molecules in the solution.The cleaned PbS QDs were dried under vacuum and then redispersed in toluene inside a glove box.30 mg of Cu/TiO 2 was dispersed in 10 ml 0.14 M 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) in N 2 -purged acetonitrile and stirred gently for 24 h.The powder was then rinsed with excess amounts of acetonitrile and dried under vacuum for 30 min.10 ml of PbS QD in toluene was then mixed with the dried, MPA treated Cu/TiO 2 and kept in the dark inside the glove box for 24 h.The solution was centrifuged and the powder was rinsed with toluene to remove any PbS QDs that were not attached to the surface of Cu/TiO 2 .By controlling the PbS QD concentration, the ratio between PbS QDs and Cu/TiO 2 can be adjusted.In the photocatalysis experiments reported here, a molar ratio of 1 : 1 PbS/TiO 2 was used (the average diameter of the TiO 2 is 20 nm).Finally, to remove excess organics and improve electronic coupling between the sensitizer and TiO 2 , the dried PbS/Cu/TiO 2 powder was first treated with 1 M hydrazine in ethanol in the glove box for 45 min, then rinsed with large amounts of ethanol and subsequently heated gently to 70 C under vacuum for 30 min. A gas-tight photocatalysis cell was constructed using a stainless steel spacer (MDC Vacuum Products) with conflat flange components and fitted with two inlet/outlet valves, one gas chromatography (GC) sampling port (HP 5890) connected via Swagelok fittings, and one UV quartz viewport; the opposite side was sealed with a blank conflat cover.A watch glass was placed at the bottom of the photocatalysis cell, on which catalyst samples were loaded for photocatalysis reaction.After a new septum was placed in the sampling port and a catalyst sample was loaded, the photocatalysis cell was purged with CO 2 bubbled through deionized water for 15 min.The photocatalysis cell was subsequently irradiated through the quartz viewport using light from a 300 W Xe arc lamp (Newport), fitted with a manual shutter and an optical filter holder.Various longpass filters were used to select wavelengths of illumination (Edmund Optics UV-vis filter kits 47-398, 47-399 and vis-NIR filter kit 47-400). GC analysis of photoreduction products was performed on a Perkin Elmer Clarus 600 Gas Chromatograph using a heated sample inlet.Sample detection was achieved using both a thermal conductivity detector and a flame ionization detector with methanizer, joined in sequence.Samples were injected manually using a 5 ml gas-tight syringe.The photocatalysis experiments with the active catalysts were repeated three times under the same reaction conditions and the variation of the CO 2 conversion rate was found to be 20. XPS was used to determine the surface composition of the PbS/ Cu/TiO 2 powders as well as the oxidation state of PbS.The powders were analyzed using a PHI 5600ci instrument, by placing them in a small well machined into the surface of the sample holder.Monochromatic Al Ka X-rays (1486.6 eV) were used and the pass energy of the analyzer was set at 58.7 eV.The insulating powders required charge neutralization with a lowenergy electron gun.Binding energies were referenced to adventitious carbon at 284.6 eV.The Pb 4f spectrum was curve fitted using XPSPEAK software after subtracting a Shirley background.The peak parameters used for the curve-fitting analysis were a combination of average values for peak positions taken from the literature and lineshapes resulting from optimizing the curve-fitting results."}, {"llm generation": "Xenon", "source": "The highest temperature measured in the catalyst bed was 38 C under the white light illumination of a Xe arc lamp suggesting that thermal contributions to the catalytic activity are absent.", "context": "Characterization of PbS/Cu/TiO 2 photocatalysts Three different sizes of PbS QDs (diameters 3, 4, and 5 nm) were used to sensitize TiO 2 decorated with Cu co-catalysts.High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images of the catalysts indicate that the PbS QDs are attached to the surface of Cu/TiO 2 particles (Fig. 1b).In many cases, an orientation relationship between PbS QDs and TiO 2 anatase have been observed of the type 111 PbS FCC k101 TiO 2 anatase which is presumably due to the similar d-spacings of these two sets of planes.It is unclear if the crystallographic relationship between the sensitizer QDs and the TiO 2 is important for electron transfer and overall catalyst performance.The Cu co-catalysts are more difficult to identify in TEM and HRTEM images, but regions that can be indexed to Cu in contact with TiO 2 anatase have been observed with HRTEM.Elemental analysis using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) also confirms the existence of Cu metal in addition to the presence of Pb, S, Ti, and O (data not shown).The diffuse reflectance spectra (Fig. 1c) of the heterostructured photocatalysts further demonstrate that the optical properties of PbS QDs are preserved in the heterostructured catalysts.The first exciton peak of 3 nm PbS QDs at 735 nm is obscured by the Cu/ TiO 2 absorption and therefore not as distinguishable as for the other two sizes of PbS QDs. With the structural and optical properties of the PbS QD sensitized TiO 2 catalysts characterized, we examined their activity for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 in the presence of H 2 O. GC analysis indicates that the main products of all the reactions reported include CO, CH 4 , C 2 H 6 and H 2 .Control experiments on PbS QDs or Cu/TiO 2 alone find no photocatalytic activity under visible light illumination, illustrating that the formation of a heterostructure between the QD and the Cu-loaded TiO 2 is required for activity.The highest temperature measured in the catalyst bed was 38 C under the white light illumination of a Xe arc lamp suggesting that thermal contributions to the catalytic activity are absent.To further test for thermal effects, control experiments were run by loading a cell with PbS QD sensitized Cu/TiO 2 , CO 2 , and H 2 O and placing it in a dark oven at 50 C yielding only trace amounts of CH 4 and CO, demonstrating that the activity seen in our reactions definitely results from the photoexcitation of the heterostructure. Fig. 2 shows the normalized CO 2 conversion rate as a function of illumination wavelengths for three different sized PbS QDs sensitized Cu/TiO 2 photocatalysts.The optical filters used are a longpass type which allow longer wavelengths of light to transmit, but block higher energy photons.As expected, the threshold for photocatalytic activity shifts to longer wavelength for larger PbS QDs, verifying the central role played by PbS QDs.For 5 nm PbS QD sensitized Cu/TiO 2 , significant photocatalytic activity is seen at wavelengths as low in energy as 610 nm.Reports clearly demonstrating the visible light photoreduction of CO 2 are exceptionally rare and this activity appears to be unique for the low energy orange-red edge of the spectrum illustrating the utility of our approach for harnessing larger portions of the solar spectrum for CO 2 management applications. 2For all three sizes of QDs, the threshold energy for activity is larger than the bandgap of the PbS QD sensitizers (Fig. 2 inset). 17For the largest PbS QD used in our experiment, the bottom of the conduction band of PbS QD is below that of TiO 2 (Fig. 1a), and therefore band-edge excitation is not expected to directly lead to charge injection from the 5 nm QDs into TiO 2 . 13,14Photoexcitation to higher energy states in the conduction band is therefore necessary for charge separation to occur between the 5 nm PbS QDs and TiO 2 .The threshold is 2 eV for this sample and about 2.2 times higher than the bandgap of the 5 nm PbS QD (0.91 eV).A similar observation has been reported for 10 nm PbS QDs (E g 14 0.85 eV) which need an excitation of 700 nm photons or 1.77 eV (2.1 times E g ) to initiate electron injection into TiO 2 . 16Our results further demonstrate the strong electronic interaction between PbS QD excited states and the TiO 2 conduction band 16 such that charge separation is enabled by above bandgap excitation for large PbS QDs where the band alignment with TiO 2 is not favorable for charge injection under band-edge excitation.For the two smaller sized PbS QD sensitized Cu/TiO 2 photocatalytsts, relatively low light absorption at the first exciton peak combined with the overall low CO 2 conversion yield of the TiO 2 catalysts may account for the lack of discernable photocatalytic activity under direct band-edge excitation.At higher excitation energies, this issue is overcome as light absorption significantly increases and photoexcited electrons cool to the bottom of the conduction band and subsequently inject into TiO 2 because of the favorable band alignment for these two sizes of PbS QDs. 13,14n addition, electrons in higher excited states in PbS QDs can also directly inject into the TiO 2 conduction band to initiate the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 . 16o evaluate the effectiveness of PbS QD sensitization, we compare the total CO 2 conversion yield under white light irradiation.Fig. 3 demonstrates that all of the PbS QD sensitized TiO 2 catalysts are at least 3 times as active as the Cu co-catalysts loaded commercial Evonik AeroxideO TiO 2 P25 under the same reaction conditions.In particular, the 4 nm PbS QD sensitized Cu/TiO 2 catalyst shows the highest CO 2 conversion yield of 1.71 mmol g A1 h A1 (0.82 mmol g A1 h A1 CO, 0.58 mmol g A1 h A1 CH 4 , and 0.31 mmol g A1 h A1 C 2 H 6 ), 18 which is 5 times the CO 2 reduction products generation rate of Cu/TiO 2 without the use of the sensitizers.Additionally, the CO 2 conversion rates for the 3, 4 and 5 nm PbS QD sensitized Cu/TiO 2 catalysts under visible light irradiation (l 400 nm for 3 nm PbS QD sensitized catalyst, and l 420 nm for 4 and 5 nm PbS QD sensitized catalyst) are 0.45, 1.12, and 0.60 mmol g A1 h A1 , respectively.All of these yields are higher than that of the Cu/TiO 2 without sensitizers under white light irradiation (0.32 mmol g A1 h A1 ).These results illustrate the general utility of the QDs for sensitization across UV and visible spectral ranges.Furthermore, we expect that the CO 2 conversion efficiency of the PbS QD sensitized Cu/ TiO 2 heterostructured photocatalyst can be substantially improved by, for example, incorporating highly active enzymemodified TiO 2 nanoparticles. 8t is interesting to note that the 4 nm PbS QD sensitized TiO 2 shows the highest CO 2 conversion rate among the 3 sizes of PbS QDs investigated.This can be understood by considering that the overall efficiency should result from a combination of photon absorption and the charge separation yield.The smallest PbS QDs are expected to exhibit the fastest electron injection rates. 13,19However, the 3 nm PbS QD sensitized Cu/TiO 2 sample only utilizes photons with wavelengths shorter than 515 nm (Fig. 2).In contrast, the 5 nm PbS QDs can enable the TiO 2 catalyst to become active at up to 610 nm despite having the lowest charge separation yield among the 3 sizes of PbS QDs. 13,19b19b The balance of these two competing factors results in the observation that 4 nm PbS QD sensitized Cu/TiO 2 catalysts show the highest CO 2 conversion yield under white light illumination.It would be important to more quantitatively determine the efficiency differences of utilizing photons by different sized PbS QDs.However, this would require the accurate measurement of the number of photons absorbed by PbS QDs in the heterostructured catalysts that are directly involved in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 , which is beyond the scope of the present work. The effect of the sizes of PbS QDs on the photocatalytic activity can be further complicated by the fact that smaller QDs with faster electron injection times also have faster charge recombination dynamics between the injected electrons and the oxidized PbS QDs, presumably due to the reduced distance between the electrons and holes for smaller QDs. 13 Fully exploring the various effects of the PbS QD sizes on the overall photocatalytic activity can therefore present additional opportunities to optimize the CO 2 photoreduction performance. The photocatalysts become inactive after 8 h of continuous visible light irradiation, similar to what was reported previously for CdSe 11 and PbSe 17 sensitized TiO 2 catalysts.The deactivation is presumably due to the photo-oxidation of the small bandgap semiconductor sensitizers, a well-known phenomenon especially in the presence of H 2 O. 20 Specifically, the photo-oxidation of CdSe QDs on TiO 2 surfaces has been reported. 21To further verify this assumption and better understand the fate of the QD sensitizers, XPS was used to probe the oxidation state change in PbS QDs.As shown in Fig. 4, the Pb 4f core-level spectra reveal the contribution from unoxidized PbS and its oxidation products. 22,23Each peak is also a superposition of two components attributed to the contribution from the Pb in the volume of the QD and Pb atoms on the QD surface. 24As reported previously, the higher-energy features in the XPS spectra are assigned to Pb-O adducts in the form of PbO or Pb(OH) 2 . 22,23Approximately 18 of the Pb in the PbS QDs is partially oxidized before exposure to light (Fig. 4a).The sensitivity of PbS QDs to air has been reported 23 and it is therefore not surprising that the PbS QDs are more prone to oxidation after removing the capping molecules in our heterostructured photocatalysts.After 8 h of phototcatalytic reaction under l 420 nm illumination, the amount of Pb-O adducts significantly increases and up to 80 of the Pb in the QDs is oxidized (Fig. 4b).The observed photooxidation of PbS QDs is consistent with previous studies of CdSe photodegradation on TiO 2 surface 21 and agrees with our proposed deactivation mechanism resulting from the accumulation of photo-generated holes in the QDs valence band in a system which (currently) lacks hole scavengers to regenerate the oxidized QDs. It is worth emphasizing that the operation principle of semiconductor QD sensitized TiO 2 is thermodynamically sound.In our system, photoexcitation of the PbS QDs generates charge carriers which are separated at the PbS/TiO 2 interface when electrons are injected into the conduction band of TiO 2 .This electron injection subsequently leads to the reduction of CO 2 on the TiO 2 surface.The photogenerated holes, however, are left in the valence band of PbS QDs because they lack the correct energetics to oxidize water, a fact which has never been disputed by our group.The accumulated holes eventually result in the oxidation of PbS to form PbSO 3 , PbO, Pb(OH) 2 , etc., as shown by our XPS measurements and similar to the photo-oxidation processes reported for other small bandgap QDs. 20,21,23The transition-metal complexes currently under investigation as CO 2 photo-reduction catalysts face similar issues with their inability to oxidize water directly, requiring the use of tertiary amines as sacrificial hole scavengers.2b The use of suitable hole scavengers is currently being investigated in our group to help eliminate the deactivation of these QD sensitizers by the positively charged hole. To further comment on the operation principle of these catalysts, we point out that we are able to achieve the photoreduction of CO 2 using either H 2 O vapor or H 2 gas as the H-atom source.The main product is CO when H 2 is used, which is similar to a previous observation in the literature. 25The precise reaction mechanism for this system is still under investigation, but current and past data on the photophysics of these heterostructures clearly indicate that the mechanisms involving H 2 O oxidation by photogenerated holes do not apply.As the valence bands of the QDs are known to be too negative to initiate H 2 O oxidation, this mechanism has never been a viable physical process for explaining the reactivity of this system."}], "reaction medium": [{"llm generation": "Liquid", "source": "With the structural and optical properties of the PbS QD sensitized TiO 2 catalysts characterized, we examined their activity for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 in the presence of H 2 O.", "context": "Characterization of PbS/Cu/TiO 2 photocatalysts Three different sizes of PbS QDs (diameters 3, 4, and 5 nm) were used to sensitize TiO 2 decorated with Cu co-catalysts.High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images of the catalysts indicate that the PbS QDs are attached to the surface of Cu/TiO 2 particles (Fig. 1b).In many cases, an orientation relationship between PbS QDs and TiO 2 anatase have been observed of the type 111 PbS FCC k101 TiO 2 anatase which is presumably due to the similar d-spacings of these two sets of planes.It is unclear if the crystallographic relationship between the sensitizer QDs and the TiO 2 is important for electron transfer and overall catalyst performance.The Cu co-catalysts are more difficult to identify in TEM and HRTEM images, but regions that can be indexed to Cu in contact with TiO 2 anatase have been observed with HRTEM.Elemental analysis using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) also confirms the existence of Cu metal in addition to the presence of Pb, S, Ti, and O (data not shown).The diffuse reflectance spectra (Fig. 1c) of the heterostructured photocatalysts further demonstrate that the optical properties of PbS QDs are preserved in the heterostructured catalysts.The first exciton peak of 3 nm PbS QDs at 735 nm is obscured by the Cu/ TiO 2 absorption and therefore not as distinguishable as for the other two sizes of PbS QDs.

To further comment on the operation principle of these catalysts, we point out that we are able to achieve the photoreduction of CO 2 using either H 2 O vapor or H 2 gas as the H-atom source.The main product is CO when H 2 is used, which is similar to a previous observation in the literature. 25The precise reaction mechanism for this system is still under investigation, but current and past data on the photophysics of these heterostructures clearly indicate that the mechanisms involving H 2 O oxidation by photogenerated holes do not apply.As the valence bands of the QDs are known to be too negative to initiate H 2 O oxidation, this mechanism has never been a viable physical process for explaining the reactivity of this system."}, {"llm generation": "Gas", "source": "With the structural and optical properties of the PbS QD sensitized TiO 2 catalysts characterized, we examined their activity for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 in the presence of H 2 O.", "context": "Characterization of PbS/Cu/TiO 2 photocatalysts Three different sizes of PbS QDs (diameters 3, 4, and 5 nm) were used to sensitize TiO 2 decorated with Cu co-catalysts.High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images of the catalysts indicate that the PbS QDs are attached to the surface of Cu/TiO 2 particles (Fig. 1b).In many cases, an orientation relationship between PbS QDs and TiO 2 anatase have been observed of the type 111 PbS FCC k101 TiO 2 anatase which is presumably due to the similar d-spacings of these two sets of planes.It is unclear if the crystallographic relationship between the sensitizer QDs and the TiO 2 is important for electron transfer and overall catalyst performance.The Cu co-catalysts are more difficult to identify in TEM and HRTEM images, but regions that can be indexed to Cu in contact with TiO 2 anatase have been observed with HRTEM.Elemental analysis using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) also confirms the existence of Cu metal in addition to the presence of Pb, S, Ti, and O (data not shown).The diffuse reflectance spectra (Fig. 1c) of the heterostructured photocatalysts further demonstrate that the optical properties of PbS QDs are preserved in the heterostructured catalysts.The first exciton peak of 3 nm PbS QDs at 735 nm is obscured by the Cu/ TiO 2 absorption and therefore not as distinguishable as for the other two sizes of PbS QDs. With the structural and optical properties of the PbS QD sensitized TiO 2 catalysts characterized, we examined their activity for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 in the presence of H 2 O. GC analysis indicates that the main products of all the reactions reported include CO, CH 4 , C 2 H 6 and H 2 .Control experiments on PbS QDs or Cu/TiO 2 alone find no photocatalytic activity under visible light illumination, illustrating that the formation of a heterostructure between the QD and the Cu-loaded TiO 2 is required for activity.The highest temperature measured in the catalyst bed was 38 C under the white light illumination of a Xe arc lamp suggesting that thermal contributions to the catalytic activity are absent.To further test for thermal effects, control experiments were run by loading a cell with PbS QD sensitized Cu/TiO 2 , CO 2 , and H 2 O and placing it in a dark oven at 50 C yielding only trace amounts of CH 4 and CO, demonstrating that the activity seen in our reactions definitely results from the photoexcitation of the heterostructure. Fig. 2 shows the normalized CO 2 conversion rate as a function of illumination wavelengths for three different sized PbS QDs sensitized Cu/TiO 2 photocatalysts.The optical filters used are a longpass type which allow longer wavelengths of light to transmit, but block higher energy photons.As expected, the threshold for photocatalytic activity shifts to longer wavelength for larger PbS QDs, verifying the central role played by PbS QDs.For 5 nm PbS QD sensitized Cu/TiO 2 , significant photocatalytic activity is seen at wavelengths as low in energy as 610 nm.Reports clearly demonstrating the visible light photoreduction of CO 2 are exceptionally rare and this activity appears to be unique for the low energy orange-red edge of the spectrum illustrating the utility of our approach for harnessing larger portions of the solar spectrum for CO 2 management applications. 2For all three sizes of QDs, the threshold energy for activity is larger than the bandgap of the PbS QD sensitizers (Fig. 2 inset). 17For the largest PbS QD used in our experiment, the bottom of the conduction band of PbS QD is below that of TiO 2 (Fig. 1a), and therefore band-edge excitation is not expected to directly lead to charge injection from the 5 nm QDs into TiO 2 . 13,14Photoexcitation to higher energy states in the conduction band is therefore necessary for charge separation to occur between the 5 nm PbS QDs and TiO 2 .The threshold is 2 eV for this sample and about 2.2 times higher than the bandgap of the 5 nm PbS QD (0.91 eV).A similar observation has been reported for 10 nm PbS QDs (E g 14 0.85 eV) which need an excitation of 700 nm photons or 1.77 eV (2.1 times E g ) to initiate electron injection into TiO 2 . 16Our results further demonstrate the strong electronic interaction between PbS QD excited states and the TiO 2 conduction band 16 such that charge separation is enabled by above bandgap excitation for large PbS QDs where the band alignment with TiO 2 is not favorable for charge injection under band-edge excitation.For the two smaller sized PbS QD sensitized Cu/TiO 2 photocatalytsts, relatively low light absorption at the first exciton peak combined with the overall low CO 2 conversion yield of the TiO 2 catalysts may account for the lack of discernable photocatalytic activity under direct band-edge excitation.At higher excitation energies, this issue is overcome as light absorption significantly increases and photoexcited electrons cool to the bottom of the conduction band and subsequently inject into TiO 2 because of the favorable band alignment for these two sizes of PbS QDs. 13,14n addition, electrons in higher excited states in PbS QDs can also directly inject into the TiO 2 conduction band to initiate the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 . 16o evaluate the effectiveness of PbS QD sensitization, we compare the total CO 2 conversion yield under white light irradiation.Fig. 3 demonstrates that all of the PbS QD sensitized TiO 2 catalysts are at least 3 times as active as the Cu co-catalysts loaded commercial Evonik AeroxideO TiO 2 P25 under the same reaction conditions.In particular, the 4 nm PbS QD sensitized Cu/TiO 2 catalyst shows the highest CO 2 conversion yield of 1.71 mmol g A1 h A1 (0.82 mmol g A1 h A1 CO, 0.58 mmol g A1 h A1 CH 4 , and 0.31 mmol g A1 h A1 C 2 H 6 ), 18 which is 5 times the CO 2 reduction products generation rate of Cu/TiO 2 without the use of the sensitizers.Additionally, the CO 2 conversion rates for the 3, 4 and 5 nm PbS QD sensitized Cu/TiO 2 catalysts under visible light irradiation (l 400 nm for 3 nm PbS QD sensitized catalyst, and l 420 nm for 4 and 5 nm PbS QD sensitized catalyst) are 0.45, 1.12, and 0.60 mmol g A1 h A1 , respectively.All of these yields are higher than that of the Cu/TiO 2 without sensitizers under white light irradiation (0.32 mmol g A1 h A1 ).These results illustrate the general utility of the QDs for sensitization across UV and visible spectral ranges.Furthermore, we expect that the CO 2 conversion efficiency of the PbS QD sensitized Cu/ TiO 2 heterostructured photocatalyst can be substantially improved by, for example, incorporating highly active enzymemodified TiO 2 nanoparticles. 8t is interesting to note that the 4 nm PbS QD sensitized TiO 2 shows the highest CO 2 conversion rate among the 3 sizes of PbS QDs investigated.This can be understood by considering that the overall efficiency should result from a combination of photon absorption and the charge separation yield.The smallest PbS QDs are expected to exhibit the fastest electron injection rates. 13,19However, the 3 nm PbS QD sensitized Cu/TiO 2 sample only utilizes photons with wavelengths shorter than 515 nm (Fig. 2).In contrast, the 5 nm PbS QDs can enable the TiO 2 catalyst to become active at up to 610 nm despite having the lowest charge separation yield among the 3 sizes of PbS QDs. 13,19b19b The balance of these two competing factors results in the observation that 4 nm PbS QD sensitized Cu/TiO 2 catalysts show the highest CO 2 conversion yield under white light illumination.It would be important to more quantitatively determine the efficiency differences of utilizing photons by different sized PbS QDs.However, this would require the accurate measurement of the number of photons absorbed by PbS QDs in the heterostructured catalysts that are directly involved in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 , which is beyond the scope of the present work. The effect of the sizes of PbS QDs on the photocatalytic activity can be further complicated by the fact that smaller QDs with faster electron injection times also have faster charge recombination dynamics between the injected electrons and the oxidized PbS QDs, presumably due to the reduced distance between the electrons and holes for smaller QDs. 13 Fully exploring the various effects of the PbS QD sizes on the overall photocatalytic activity can therefore present additional opportunities to optimize the CO 2 photoreduction performance.
