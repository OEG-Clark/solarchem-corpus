Spherical and square nanocrystals are observed with a particle size of around 10 nm (Fig. 2A).EDS mapping analysis shows that element Mo was uniformly dispersed on the surface of TiO 2 .(Fig. 2 B-D) Fig. 1C shows the characteristic powder-XRD patterns of the samples.The diffraction peaks around 2 of 25.3, 38.0, 47.9, 53.9, 55.1, 62.8, 68.7, 70.4and 75.2correspond to the crystal planes (101), (004), ( 200), ( 105), ( 211), ( 204), ( 116), (215) of anatase TiO 2 (JCPDS Card No. 21-1272), respectively.14,36 No other phases were detected for all the samples.Based on the Scherrer equation and the broadening of the (101) peak, the average crystallite sizes of anatase TiO 2 were calculated to be 13.8, 12.8, 12.7 and 12.8 nm for TiO 2 , 0.1 Mo/TiO 2 , 0.3 Mo/TiO 2 and 0.5 Mo/TiO 2 , respectively (shown in Table 1).Clearly, the addition of element Mo slightly decreases the crystallite sizes, in accord with the specific surface area measurements, which can be explained by the reason that the external Mo ions retard the growth of TiO 2 crystallites during the preparation.30 The lattice parameters, an important indicator of the structural response to the dopant dissolution, are derived from XRD patterns and listed in Table 1.The a and c axial lengths of the TiO 2 sample are 3.7864 and 9.5047 A, respectively.The a-axial lengths of TiO 2 in the Mo/TiO 2 samples are comparable to that of the TiO 2 sample, while the c-axial lengths and c/a ratios have been reduced, reflecting the lattice contraction of TiO 2 . According to Hume-Rothery's rules for metallic substitutional doping, substitutional doping is favored when the dopant radius varies by 15 of that of the matrix cation.37 Mo 3d core level XPS spectrum of 0.3 Mo/TiO 2 shows that there are Mo 6 and Mo 5 near the surface (Fig. 1D).38 Mo 6 radius (0.073 nm) is slightly smaller while Mo 5 (0.075 nm) is slightly larger than that of Ti 4 (0.0745 nm).37 This suggests that Mo substitutional doping is highly likely in the Mo/TiO 2 samples.From size considerations alone, Mo 5 substitution for Ti 4 would be expected to cause lattice expansion of TiO 2 .Mo 6 substitution would give rise to lattice construction.From valence considerations alone, Mo 6 and Mo 5 with a relatively higher electronegativity would be expected to reduce both the ab plane and c-axis.Because the ab plane is tightly packed, the a-axial is hardly effected.31,37,39 Whereas the c-axis is shortened by the valence effect. The Raman data is shown in Fig. 3. Five typical vibrational modes at around 144 cm -1 (E g (1)), 197 cm -1 (E g (2)), 399 cm -1 (B 1g ), 516 cm -1 (A 1g B 1g (2)) and 639 cm -1 (E g (3)) assigned to anatase TiO 2 are observed for all the photocatalysts.40 Among them, the E g (1) peak is the most intense and the most investigated in the literature, 41 which corresponds to the O-Ti-O bending type vibration 42.The E g (1) peak appears to be increasingly shifted toward higher wavenumbers with increasing the Mo concentrations, accompanied by the broadening of full width at the half-maximum (HWHM).Several effects could cause the variation of position and width of this peak, such as defects in the stoichiometry, 43 phonon confinement in nanoparticles, extrinsic doping 44, pressure and temperature effects.A research reported by Li Bassi and co-worker suggested that the stoichiometry defects in anatase TiO 2 contributed to the peak blue-shift, while the peak width seems to be less affected by the oxygen concentration, 43 which is inconsistent in the case of the present work.Based on the fact that the crystallite sizes of the three Mo-doped samples are almost equal, it can be speculated that the incessant blue-shift and broadening of the E g (1) peak with the Mo concentrations increasing should not be assigned to phonon confinement.Additionally, the pressure and temperature effects can also be ruled out due to the same conditions for Raman analysis.Thus, Mo doping is most likely responsible for the blue-shift and broadening of the E g (1) peak.Mo doping causes the lattice construction, evidenced by XRD analysis, thereby reinforcing the O-Ti-O bending vibration.Based on the results above, it can be concluded that Mo-doped TiO 2 photocatalysts were successfully fabricated by a one-pot hydrothermal method. The UV-vis absorption spectra of the TiO 2 and Mo-doped TiO 2 photocatalysts are shown in Fig. 4A.The TiO 2 photocatalyst only absorbs the light with wavelength lower than 400 nm, in agreement with previous reports.45 After Mo doping, the photocatalysts appear to absorb visible light and the visible-light absorption slightly increases with the Mo concentrations increasing, which can be attributed to the transition from O 2p to Mo 4d and the intra-band transition of between Mo 4d and Ti 3d states 30.The transient photocurrent measurements and fluorescence emission spectroscopy were used to probe the efficiency of photoinduced charge-carrier separation of the photocatalysts.As shown in Fig. 4B.Each electrode exhibits a current response to light, 4C.The weaker fluorescence emission peaks, the higher photoinduced charge-carrier separation efficiency.The peak centered at around 396 cm -1 is assigned to the electron transfer between the conduction band and the valence band.46 The peak height first decreases and then increases with the Mo concentrations increasing.It is the lowest for 0.1 Mo/TiO 2 , further confirming the highest efficiency of the photoinduced charge-carrier separation.Theoretical calculation indicates that Mo doping induces some splits in VB and CB because of the breaking of symmetry of TiO 2 lattice, thereby facilitating the separation of electrons and holes, 30 whereas the excessive Mo 6 ions would be served as a carrier recombination center, 29,47 which explain the observation that the efficiency of the electron-hole separation is the highest at the Mo doping concentration of about 0.1 wt but begins to decrease with further increasing the Mo concentrations.The improved charge transport of the Mo-doped TiO 2 photocatalysts can be very classically confirmed by the decreased hemicycle radius measured by using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), due to the presence of electron donor Mo 5 (Fig. 4D). Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was carried out in a reactor equipped with an online gas chromatograph to monitor products.In addition to oxygen, CO and CH 4 were found to be the main products for CO 2 reduction, no other carbon-containing products were detected by GC, in agreement with previous reports.35 The averaged activities for three independent measurements of the samples are provided in Fig. 5. CO and CH 4 yields increase with irradiation time.At the first hour, CO yield is the lowest for TiO 2 , but it is dramatically increasing.At the fourth and fifth hours CO yield for TiO 2 is already greater than for 0.1 Mo/ TiO 2 and 0.5 Mo/TiO 2 photocatalysts.CH 4 yield for TiO 2 is always lower than for Mo-doped photocatalysts in the whole tests.It is known that the reduction of CO 2 to CO requires two photoinduced electrons and two protons and that CH 4 production needs eight photoinduced electrons and eight protons, involving multiple reaction steps.Because the photoinduced electrons of TiO 2 mainly serve for CO production, the CO yield growth is relatively faster with irradiation time.At the fifth hours, the mean CO yields were detected to be 29, 26, 41 and 23 mol/ g and the mean CH 4 yields were 4, 18, 49 and 11 mol/g for TiO 2 , 0.1 Mo/TiO 2 , 0.3 Mo/TiO 2 and 0.5 Mo/TiO 2 , respectively.Based on carbon conservation, the conversion of CO 2 is calculated to be about 33, 44, 90 and 34 mol after 5 h of irradiation.Fig. 5C shows the CH 4 selectivity over the photocatalysts after 5 h of light irradiation.it is found that the CH 4 selectivity is increased with the Mo concentrations increasing and reaches 54.1 at a Mo concentration of about 0.3 wt.With further increasing the Mo concentrations, the CH 4 selectivity begins to decrease.It is better to compare a product selectivity at the same level of the transformation of reactants.Therefore, the CH 4 selectivity at the CO 2 conversion of 33 mol over the photocatalysts is supplied in Fig. 5D.Here, 33 mol of CO 2 transformation is derived from CO and CH 4 yields according to carbon conservation.The CH 4 selectivity was calculated to be 12.8 , 40.6 , 46.2 and 30.3 for TiO 2 , 0.1 Mo/ TiO 2 , 0.3 Mo/TiO 2 and 0.5 Mo/TiO 2 , respectively.Wang and coworkers reported that the CH 4 selectivity can exceed 95 over ultrafine Pt Nanoparticles on TiO 2 single crystals.23 Therefore, there is room for CH 4 selectivity improvement over Mo-doped TiO 2 by material structure and surface regulation. It is well known that the photoinduced electron-hole separation is a prerequisite for photocatalysis.The 0.1 Mo/TiO 2 photocatalyst exhibits the highest efficiency of photoinduced charge carrier separation, but the activity and selectivity to CH 4 are not the highest, indicating that there should be other factors controlling photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to CH 4 over Mo-doped TiO 2 . In order to explore other possible reasons for the enhanced CH 4 selectivity over Mo-doped TiO 2 , EPR measurements of TiO 2 and 0.3 Mo/TiO 2 before and after the adsorption of CO 2 and H 2 O were carried out at 300 K.As shown in Fig. 6, a relatively stronger signal at g 1.964 is observed for TiO 2 before the adsorption of reactants, which can be assigned to the Ti 3 ions.48,49 A weak signal at g 2.001 corresponds to oxygen vacancies in the lattice of TiO 2 .49,50 After the adsorption of reactants, the Ti 3 signal almost disappears, indicating that Ti 3 spin centers locate at the surface.Whereas a new signal at g 2.08 appear, corresponding to oxygen vacancies at the surface of TiO 2 51.These results suggest that Ti 3 spin centers transform to oxygen vacancy spin centers after the adsorption of reactants.Note that the reactant adsorption has no influence on oxygen vacancies in the lattice.As for 0.3 Mo/TiO 2 before the adsorption of reactants, two differentiable signals can be assigned to Mo 5 with the set of g values g 1.899 and g 1.928, 52,53 which are observably weakened after the adsorption of reactants.At the same time, a new signal at g 1.941 is observed, probably due to the formation of Ti 3 spin centers near Mo ions.It should be note that there is no Ti 3 at the native surface of 0.3 Mo/TiO 2 , implying that the presence of Mo suppresses the Ti 3 generation during the preparation.This can be attributed to the higher electronegativity of Mo (VI) than Ti (III), leading to the transform of Ti 3 to Ti 4 according to the Eq. 2. In sum, Mo doping overtly changes the surface structure of TiO 2 and adjusts the adsorption of reactants on the surface. To identify whether Mo doping adjusts the interaction of CO 2 with catalyst surfaces leading to the higher selectivity to CH 4 over Mo-doped TiO 2 , Photocatalytic CO, formaldehyde, and methanol reductions with H 2 O vapor were carried out over TiO 2 and 0.3 Mo/TiO 2 under the same conditions with CO 2 photoreduction.These reactions were chosen because it was considered by many theoretical calculations that these C1 molecules were intermediates for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.54 As shown in Fig. 7, CH 4 yields over 0.3 Mo/TiO 2 are higher than that over TiO 2 regardless of which C1 molecule is served as the reactant, implying that the enhanced CH 4 selectivity over Mo-doped TiO 2 might not relate with the surface-CO 2 interaction.So far, two pathways for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction were proposed according to whether the hydrogenation or the deoxygenation process is faster.545556 In the fast-hydrogenation pathway, CO 2 is reduced along the path CO 2 HCOOHCH 2 OCH 3 OHCH 4 ; and in the fast-deoxygenation pathway, it follows the path CO 2 COCCH 2 CH 3 CH 4 .Very little CH 4 was produced when CH 3 OH and CH 2 O were served as reactants, whereas CH 4 yields derived from CO reductions are observably higher than those from CO 2 reductions.The results show that photocatalytic CO 2 reduction appears to follow the fast-deoxygenation pathway over TiO 2 and Mo-doped TiO 2 , which will be further evidenced by EPR spin trapping of CH 3 in a NaCO 3 aqueous solution. In the liquid-solid photocatalytic CO 2 reduction system, where CO 2 was dissolved in photocatalyst-dispersed aqueous solutions, carbonates/bicarbonates are the actual reactants in the overall reaction mechanism.57 Thus, sodium carbonate solution was used to simulate the liquid-solid CO 2 reduction system in the work, and the spin-trapping technique was applied to monitor possible radicals.Fig. 8 presents EPR spectra recorded after 1 min of illumination of the photocatalyst dispersions containing DMPO as a spin trap.The signals for DMPO-CH 3 adducts were observed in the presence of sodium carbonate, 57 proving that CH 3 is crucial intermediate for CH 4 generation.Note that the signals for DMPO-OH adducts were also detected, suggesting that H 2 O competes with carbonate for photogenerated holes.According to signal intensity for DMPO-CH 3 adducts, the amount of CH 3 generated first increases and then decreases with the Mo doping concentrations increasing, in the same order as CH 4 yield and selectivity.The result further implied that the enhanced CH 4 did not depend on the interaction between CO 2 molecules and catalyst surfaces.0.5 Mo/TiO 2 exhibits the lower CH 3 production than 0.3 Mo/TiO 2 , due to the decreased electron-hole separation. To examine the interaction of H 2 O molecules with catalyst surfaces, the Fourier infrared spectra of absorbed D 2 O on the surface of the photocatalysts were conducted, where D 2 O was selected to eliminate interference from H 2 O vapor in air and OH groups at the catalyst surface.The self-supporting wafers (15 mg) were first annealed in an IR cell at 473 K under vacuum for 2 h to remove the adsorbed impurities.After the IR cell was cooled naturally, D 2 O vapor were introduced into the cell.Prior to the measurements, the IR cell was evacuated for 15 min to remove gaseous-and physically adsorbed-D 2 O molecules.Fig. 9 shows IR spectra for D 2 O adsorbed on the photocatalysts; the band of the photocatalysts were used as the background.A peak observed at 2720 cm -1 can be assigned to DO groups derived from the dissociative adsorption of D 2 O. 58596061 The peak of DO group was not observed for bare TiO 2 , and the peak height increases with increasing the Mo concentrations.The results show a weak ability to dissociate H 2 O molecules over bare TiO 2 , in agreements with previous reports.62 In contrast, Mo doping promotes the H 2 O dissociation and strengthens the interaction of H 2 O with catalyst surfaces.The peak height of DO group for 0.5 Mo/TiO 2 is higher than that for 0.3 Mo/ TiO 2 , suggesting the more amount of D 2 O dissociated.Note that the peak of DO group was not observed for 0.1 Mo/TiO 2 (not shown in Fig. 9).This is because the amount of DO group generated on 0.1 Mo/ TiO 2 goes beyond the detection limit of the infrared spectrometer.Theoretical calculation shows that the adsorption free energy of H 2 O over MoO x clusters exceed -2.0 eV, implying the high ability to activate H 2 O molecules, 26 which supports the results of this work. In the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O, H 2 O supply protons for CH 4 generation, accompanying water oxidation to produce hydroxyl radicals or O 2 (equ.3-4).As such, the efficiency of proton generation depends on the water oxidation step.Thus, the amount of OH can be also used to assess the proton supply for CO 2 reduction.Herein, DMPO was used as the trapping agent for the detection of OH in water and the results are displayed in Fig. 10.The ESR signals-a 1:2:2:1 quartet pattern, with a splitting of about 1.5 m T characteristic of a DMPO-OH adduct-are clearly observed.52 According to the signal intensity, it can be inferred that the production of OH were promoted by Mo doping, and 0.3 Mo/TiO 2 , whose efficiency of photoinduced charge-carrier separation is not the highest, exhibits the largest OH production, being consistent with the case of CH 4 production from CO 2 reduction.This result also indicates that H 2 O activation by Mo doping plays the key role of H 2 O oxidation that is the semireaction for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O. On the other hand, 0.5 Mo/TiO 2 has a higher ability to H 2 O activation, but OH production is lower than 0.3 Mo/TiO 2 .This is attributed to the decreased photoinduced electron-hole separation. In the CH 4 formation, CO 2 molecules are first adsorbed on the surface of catalysts and react with photoinduced electrons, forming activated adducts.The adducts deoxygenate and were bonded with protons to generate CH 3 and then CH 4 , illustrated in Scheme 1.The adduct generation depends on the photoinduced electron-hole separation.The higher electron-hole separation efficiency, the more adducts generated.On the other hand, if the adducts cannot be bound to protons in time, they will deactivate via vibration relaxation or heat inactivation.In other words, the CH 4 selectivity and yield are at least dominated by the two factors of the proton supply and the electron-hole separation.The ability of Mo-doped TiO 2 to H 2 O activation and dissociation increases with increasing the Mo doping concentrations, whereas the electron-hole separation efficiency first increases and then decreases with the Mo doping concentrations increasing.As such, there is an optimal Mo doping concentration for CH 4 generation.In the work, 0.3 wt of the Mo doping concertation is the best for CH 4 generation.Although 0.1 Mo/TiO 2 has the highest electron-hole separation efficiency, the ability to H 2 O activation and dissociation is relatively weaker, leading to a relatively lower CH 4 selectivity.Whereas the lower electron-hole separation efficiency of 0.5 Mo/TiO 2 results in a decrease in CH 4 selectivity."}, {"llm generation": "0.1 Mo/TiO 2", "source": "N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms and pore size distribution curves of the TiO 2 , 0.1 Mo/TiO 2 , 0.3 Mo/TiO 2 and 0.5 Mo/TiO 2 samples are shown in Fig. 1 A andB.", "context": "N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms and pore size distribution curves of the TiO 2 , 0.1 Mo/TiO 2 , 0.3 Mo/TiO 2 and 0.5 Mo/TiO 2 samples are shown in Fig. 1 A andB.All the isotherms are of the type-IV adsorption with a loop ring of type-H3 and there are no obvious saturation adsorption platforms, indicating the presence of irregular mesopores in the samples.35 The pore size distributions of the photocatalysts are relatively concentrated with the most probable pore sizes at around 10 nm (Fig. 1B).The BET surface area and pore volume of TiO 2 were measured to be 119 m 2 /g and 0.32 cm 3 /g.The addition of Mo increases the surface area and pore volume but has no influence on the average pore size of the samples (Table 1).TEM and EDS mapping images of a representative photocatalyst 0.3 Mo/TiO 2 are shown in Fig. 2. Spherical and square nanocrystals are observed with a particle size of around 10 nm (Fig. 2A).EDS mapping analysis shows that element Mo was uniformly dispersed on the surface of TiO 2 .(Fig. 2 B-D) Fig. 1C shows the characteristic powder-XRD patterns of the samples.The diffraction peaks around 2 of 25.3, 38.0, 47.9, 53.9, 55.1, 62.8, 68.7, 70.4and 75.2correspond to the crystal planes (101), (004), ( 200), ( 105), ( 211), ( 204), ( 116), (215) of anatase TiO 2 (JCPDS Card No. 21-1272), respectively.14,36 No other phases were detected for all the samples.Based on the Scherrer equation and the broadening of the (101) peak, the average crystallite sizes of anatase TiO 2 were calculated to be 13.8, 12.8, 12.7 and 12.8 nm for TiO 2 , 0.1 Mo/TiO 2 , 0.3 Mo/TiO 2 and 0.5 Mo/TiO 2 , respectively (shown in Table 1).Clearly, the addition of element Mo slightly decreases the crystallite sizes, in accord with the specific surface area measurements, which can be explained by the reason that the external Mo ions retard the growth of TiO 2 crystallites during the preparation.30 The lattice parameters, an important indicator of the structural response to the dopant dissolution, are derived from XRD patterns and listed in Table 1.The a and c axial lengths of the TiO 2 sample are 3.7864 and 9.5047 A, respectively.The a-axial lengths of TiO 2 in the Mo/TiO 2 samples are comparable to that of the TiO 2 sample, while the c-axial lengths and c/a ratios have been reduced, reflecting the lattice contraction of TiO 2 . According to Hume-Rothery's rules for metallic substitutional doping, substitutional doping is favored when the dopant radius varies by 15 of that of the matrix cation.37 Mo 3d core level XPS spectrum of 0.3 Mo/TiO 2 shows that there are Mo 6 and Mo 5 near the surface (Fig. 1D).38 Mo 6 radius (0.073 nm) is slightly smaller while Mo 5 (0.075 nm) is slightly larger than that of Ti 4 (0.0745 nm).37 This suggests that Mo substitutional doping is highly likely in the Mo/TiO 2 samples.From size considerations alone, Mo 5 substitution for Ti 4 would be expected to cause lattice expansion of TiO 2 .Mo 6 substitution would give rise to lattice construction.From valence considerations alone, Mo 6 and Mo 5 with a relatively higher electronegativity would be expected to reduce both the ab plane and c-axis.Because the ab plane is tightly packed, the a-axial is hardly effected.31,37,39 Whereas the c-axis is shortened by the valence effect. The Raman data is shown in Fig. 3. Five typical vibrational modes at around 144 cm -1 (E g (1)), 197 cm -1 (E g (2)), 399 cm -1 (B 1g ), 516 cm -1 (A 1g B 1g (2)) and 639 cm -1 (E g (3)) assigned to anatase TiO 2 are observed for all the photocatalysts.40 Among them, the E g (1) peak is the most intense and the most investigated in the literature, 41 which corresponds to the O-Ti-O bending type vibration 42.The E g (1) peak appears to be increasingly shifted toward higher wavenumbers with increasing the Mo concentrations, accompanied by the broadening of full width at the half-maximum (HWHM).Several effects could cause the variation of position and width of this peak, such as defects in the stoichiometry, 43 phonon confinement in nanoparticles, extrinsic doping 44, pressure and temperature effects.A research reported by Li Bassi and co-worker suggested that the stoichiometry defects in anatase TiO 2 contributed to the peak blue-shift, while the peak width seems to be less affected by the oxygen concentration, 43 which is inconsistent in the case of the present work.Based on the fact that the crystallite sizes of the three Mo-doped samples are almost equal, it can be speculated that the incessant blue-shift and broadening of the E g (1) peak with the Mo concentrations increasing should not be assigned to phonon confinement.Additionally, the pressure and temperature effects can also be ruled out due to the same conditions for Raman analysis.Thus, Mo doping is most likely responsible for the blue-shift and broadening of the E g (1) peak.Mo doping causes the lattice construction, evidenced by XRD analysis, thereby reinforcing the O-Ti-O bending vibration.Based on the results above, it can be concluded that Mo-doped TiO 2 photocatalysts were successfully fabricated by a one-pot hydrothermal method. The UV-vis absorption spectra of the TiO 2 and Mo-doped TiO 2 photocatalysts are shown in Fig. 4A.The TiO 2 photocatalyst only absorbs the light with wavelength lower than 400 nm, in agreement with previous reports.45 After Mo doping, the photocatalysts appear to absorb visible light and the visible-light absorption slightly increases with the Mo concentrations increasing, which can be attributed to the transition from O 2p to Mo 4d and the intra-band transition of between Mo 4d and Ti 3d states 30.The transient photocurrent measurements and fluorescence emission spectroscopy were used to probe the efficiency of photoinduced charge-carrier separation of the photocatalysts.As shown in Fig. 4B.Each electrode exhibits a current response to light, 4C.The weaker fluorescence emission peaks, the higher photoinduced charge-carrier separation efficiency.The peak centered at around 396 cm -1 is assigned to the electron transfer between the conduction band and the valence band.46 The peak height first decreases and then increases with the Mo concentrations increasing.It is the lowest for 0.1 Mo/TiO 2 , further confirming the highest efficiency of the photoinduced charge-carrier separation.Theoretical calculation indicates that Mo doping induces some splits in VB and CB because of the breaking of symmetry of TiO 2 lattice, thereby facilitating the separation of electrons and holes, 30 whereas the excessive Mo 6 ions would be served as a carrier recombination center, 29,47 which explain the observation that the efficiency of the electron-hole separation is the highest at the Mo doping concentration of about 0.1 wt but begins to decrease with further increasing the Mo concentrations.The improved charge transport of the Mo-doped TiO 2 photocatalysts can be very classically confirmed by the decreased hemicycle radius measured by using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), due to the presence of electron donor Mo 5 (Fig. 4D). Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was carried out in a reactor equipped with an online gas chromatograph to monitor products.In addition to oxygen, CO and CH 4 were found to be the main products for CO 2 reduction, no other carbon-containing products were detected by GC, in agreement with previous reports.35 The averaged activities for three independent measurements of the samples are provided in Fig. 5. CO and CH 4 yields increase with irradiation time.At the first hour, CO yield is the lowest for TiO 2 , but it is dramatically increasing.At the fourth and fifth hours CO yield for TiO 2 is already greater than for 0.1 Mo/ TiO 2 and 0.5 Mo/TiO 2 photocatalysts.CH 4 yield for TiO 2 is always lower than for Mo-doped photocatalysts in the whole tests.It is known that the reduction of CO 2 to CO requires two photoinduced electrons and two protons and that CH 4 production needs eight photoinduced electrons and eight protons, involving multiple reaction steps.Because the photoinduced electrons of TiO 2 mainly serve for CO production, the CO yield growth is relatively faster with irradiation time.At the fifth hours, the mean CO yields were detected to be 29, 26, 41 and 23 mol/ g and the mean CH 4 yields were 4, 18, 49 and 11 mol/g for TiO 2 , 0.1 Mo/TiO 2 , 0.3 Mo/TiO 2 and 0.5 Mo/TiO 2 , respectively.Based on carbon conservation, the conversion of CO 2 is calculated to be about 33, 44, 90 and 34 mol after 5 h of irradiation.Fig. 5C shows the CH 4 selectivity over the photocatalysts after 5 h of light irradiation.it is found that the CH 4 selectivity is increased with the Mo concentrations increasing and reaches 54.1 at a Mo concentration of about 0.3 wt.With further increasing the Mo concentrations, the CH 4 selectivity begins to decrease.It is better to compare a product selectivity at the same level of the transformation of reactants.Therefore, the CH 4 selectivity at the CO 2 conversion of 33 mol over the photocatalysts is supplied in Fig. 5D.Here, 33 mol of CO 2 transformation is derived from CO and CH 4 yields according to carbon conservation.The CH 4 selectivity was calculated to be 12.8 , 40.6 , 46.2 and 30.3 for TiO 2 , 0.1 Mo/ TiO 2 , 0.3 Mo/TiO 2 and 0.5 Mo/TiO 2 , respectively.Wang and coworkers reported that the CH 4 selectivity can exceed 95 over ultrafine Pt Nanoparticles on TiO 2 single crystals.23 Therefore, there is room for CH 4 selectivity improvement over Mo-doped TiO 2 by material structure and surface regulation. It is well known that the photoinduced electron-hole separation is a prerequisite for photocatalysis.The 0.1 Mo/TiO 2 photocatalyst exhibits the highest efficiency of photoinduced charge carrier separation, but the activity and selectivity to CH 4 are not the highest, indicating that there should be other factors controlling photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to CH 4 over Mo-doped TiO 2 . In order to explore other possible reasons for the enhanced CH 4 selectivity over Mo-doped TiO 2 , EPR measurements of TiO 2 and 0.3 Mo/TiO 2 before and after the adsorption of CO 2 and H 2 O were carried out at 300 K.As shown in Fig. 6, a relatively stronger signal at g 1.964 is observed for TiO 2 before the adsorption of reactants, which can be assigned to the Ti 3 ions.48,49 A weak signal at g 2.001 corresponds to oxygen vacancies in the lattice of TiO 2 .49,50 After the adsorption of reactants, the Ti 3 signal almost disappears, indicating that Ti 3 spin centers locate at the surface.Whereas a new signal at g 2.08 appear, corresponding to oxygen vacancies at the surface of TiO 2 51.These results suggest that Ti 3 spin centers transform to oxygen vacancy spin centers after the adsorption of reactants.Note that the reactant adsorption has no influence on oxygen vacancies in the lattice.As for 0.3 Mo/TiO 2 before the adsorption of reactants, two differentiable signals can be assigned to Mo 5 with the set of g values g 1.899 and g 1.928, 52,53 which are observably weakened after the adsorption of reactants.At the same time, a new signal at g 1.941 is observed, probably due to the formation of Ti 3 spin centers near Mo ions.It should be note that there is no Ti 3 at the native surface of 0.3 Mo/TiO 2 , implying that the presence of Mo suppresses the Ti 3 generation during the preparation.This can be attributed to the higher electronegativity of Mo (VI) than Ti (III), leading to the transform of Ti 3 to Ti 4 according to the Eq. 2. In sum, Mo doping overtly changes the surface structure of TiO 2 and adjusts the adsorption of reactants on the surface. To identify whether Mo doping adjusts the interaction of CO 2 with catalyst surfaces leading to the higher selectivity to CH 4 over Mo-doped TiO 2 , Photocatalytic CO, formaldehyde, and methanol reductions with H 2 O vapor were carried out over TiO 2 and 0.3 Mo/TiO 2 under the same conditions with CO 2 photoreduction.These reactions were chosen because it was considered by many theoretical calculations that these C1 molecules were intermediates for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.54 As shown in Fig. 7, CH 4 yields over 0.3 Mo/TiO 2 are higher than that over TiO 2 regardless of which C1 molecule is served as the reactant, implying that the enhanced CH 4 selectivity over Mo-doped TiO 2 might not relate with the surface-CO 2 interaction.So far, two pathways for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction were proposed according to whether the hydrogenation or the deoxygenation process is faster.545556 In the fast-hydrogenation pathway, CO 2 is reduced along the path CO 2 HCOOHCH 2 OCH 3 OHCH 4 ; and in the fast-deoxygenation pathway, it follows the path CO 2 COCCH 2 CH 3 CH 4 .Very little CH 4 was produced when CH 3 OH and CH 2 O were served as reactants, whereas CH 4 yields derived from CO reductions are observably higher than those from CO 2 reductions.The results show that photocatalytic CO 2 reduction appears to follow the fast-deoxygenation pathway over TiO 2 and Mo-doped TiO 2 , which will be further evidenced by EPR spin trapping of CH 3 in a NaCO 3 aqueous solution. In the liquid-solid photocatalytic CO 2 reduction system, where CO 2 was dissolved in photocatalyst-dispersed aqueous solutions, carbonates/bicarbonates are the actual reactants in the overall reaction mechanism.57 Thus, sodium carbonate solution was used to simulate the liquid-solid CO 2 reduction system in the work, and the spin-trapping technique was applied to monitor possible radicals.Fig. 8 presents EPR spectra recorded after 1 min of illumination of the photocatalyst dispersions containing DMPO as a spin trap.The signals for DMPO-CH 3 adducts were observed in the presence of sodium carbonate, 57 proving that CH 3 is crucial intermediate for CH 4 generation.Note that the signals for DMPO-OH adducts were also detected, suggesting that H 2 O competes with carbonate for photogenerated holes.According to signal intensity for DMPO-CH 3 adducts, the amount of CH 3 generated first increases and then decreases with the Mo doping concentrations increasing, in the same order as CH 4 yield and selectivity.The result further implied that the enhanced CH 4 did not depend on the interaction between CO 2 molecules and catalyst surfaces.0.5 Mo/TiO 2 exhibits the lower CH 3 production than 0.3 Mo/TiO 2 , due to the decreased electron-hole separation. To examine the interaction of H 2 O molecules with catalyst surfaces, the Fourier infrared spectra of absorbed D 2 O on the surface of the photocatalysts were conducted, where D 2 O was selected to eliminate interference from H 2 O vapor in air and OH groups at the catalyst surface.The self-supporting wafers (15 mg) were first annealed in an IR cell at 473 K under vacuum for 2 h to remove the adsorbed impurities.After the IR cell was cooled naturally, D 2 O vapor were introduced into the cell.Prior to the measurements, the IR cell was evacuated for 15 min to remove gaseous-and physically adsorbed-D 2 O molecules.Fig. 9 shows IR spectra for D 2 O adsorbed on the photocatalysts; the band of the photocatalysts were used as the background.A peak observed at 2720 cm -1 can be assigned to DO groups derived from the dissociative adsorption of D 2 O. 58596061 The peak of DO group was not observed for bare TiO 2 , and the peak height increases with increasing the Mo concentrations.The results show a weak ability to dissociate H 2 O molecules over bare TiO 2 , in agreements with previous reports.62 In contrast, Mo doping promotes the H 2 O dissociation and strengthens the interaction of H 2 O with catalyst surfaces.The peak height of DO group for 0.5 Mo/TiO 2 is higher than that for 0.3 Mo/ TiO 2 , suggesting the more amount of D 2 O dissociated.Note that the peak of DO group was not observed for 0.1 Mo/TiO 2 (not shown in Fig. 9).This is because the amount of DO group generated on 0.1 Mo/ TiO 2 goes beyond the detection limit of the infrared spectrometer.Theoretical calculation shows that the adsorption free energy of H 2 O over MoO x clusters exceed -2.0 eV, implying the high ability to activate H 2 O molecules, 26 which supports the results of this work. In the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O, H 2 O supply protons for CH 4 generation, accompanying water oxidation to produce hydroxyl radicals or O 2 (equ.3-4).As such, the efficiency of proton generation depends on the water oxidation step.Thus, the amount of OH can be also used to assess the proton supply for CO 2 reduction.Herein, DMPO was used as the trapping agent for the detection of OH in water and the results are displayed in Fig. 10.The ESR signals-a 1:2:2:1 quartet pattern, with a splitting of about 1.5 m T characteristic of a DMPO-OH adduct-are clearly observed.52 According to the signal intensity, it can be inferred that the production of OH were promoted by Mo doping, and 0.3 Mo/TiO 2 , whose efficiency of photoinduced charge-carrier separation is not the highest, exhibits the largest OH production, being consistent with the case of CH 4 production from CO 2 reduction.This result also indicates that H 2 O activation by Mo doping plays the key role of H 2 O oxidation that is the semireaction for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O. On the other hand, 0.5 Mo/TiO 2 has a higher ability to H 2 O activation, but OH production is lower than 0.3 Mo/TiO 2 .This is attributed to the decreased photoinduced electron-hole separation. In the CH 4 formation, CO 2 molecules are first adsorbed on the surface of catalysts and react with photoinduced electrons, forming activated adducts.The adducts deoxygenate and were bonded with protons to generate CH 3 and then CH 4 , illustrated in Scheme 1.The adduct generation depends on the photoinduced electron-hole separation.The higher electron-hole separation efficiency, the more adducts generated.On the other hand, if the adducts cannot be bound to protons in time, they will deactivate via vibration relaxation or heat inactivation.In other words, the CH 4 selectivity and yield are at least dominated by the two factors of the proton supply and the electron-hole separation.The ability of Mo-doped TiO 2 to H 2 O activation and dissociation increases with increasing the Mo doping concentrations, whereas the electron-hole separation efficiency first increases and then decreases with the Mo doping concentrations increasing.As such, there is an optimal Mo doping concentration for CH 4 generation.In the work, 0.3 wt of the Mo doping concertation is the best for CH 4 generation.Although 0.1 Mo/TiO 2 has the highest electron-hole separation efficiency, the ability to H 2 O activation and dissociation is relatively weaker, leading to a relatively lower CH 4 selectivity.Whereas the lower electron-hole separation efficiency of 0.5 Mo/TiO 2 results in a decrease in CH 4 selectivity."}, {"llm generation": "0.3 Mo/TiO 2", "source": "N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms and pore size distribution curves of the TiO 2 , 0.1 Mo/TiO 2 , 0.3 Mo/TiO 2 and 0.5 Mo/TiO 2 samples are shown in Fig. 1 A andB.", "context": "N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms and pore size distribution curves of the TiO 2 , 0.1 Mo/TiO 2 , 0.3 Mo/TiO 2 and 0.5 Mo/TiO 2 samples are shown in Fig. 1 A andB.All the isotherms are of the type-IV adsorption with a loop ring of type-H3 and there are no obvious saturation adsorption platforms, indicating the presence of irregular mesopores in the samples.35 The pore size distributions of the photocatalysts are relatively concentrated with the most probable pore sizes at around 10 nm (Fig. 1B).The BET surface area and pore volume of TiO 2 were measured to be 119 m 2 /g and 0.32 cm 3 /g.The addition of Mo increases the surface area and pore volume but has no influence on the average pore size of the samples (Table 1).TEM and EDS mapping images of a representative photocatalyst 0.3 Mo/TiO 2 are shown in Fig. 2. Spherical and square nanocrystals are observed with a particle size of around 10 nm (Fig. 2A).EDS mapping analysis shows that element Mo was uniformly dispersed on the surface of TiO 2 .(Fig. 2 B-D) Fig. 1C shows the characteristic powder-XRD patterns of the samples.The diffraction peaks around 2 of 25.3, 38.0, 47.9, 53.9, 55.1, 62.8, 68.7, 70.4and 75.2correspond to the crystal planes (101), (004), ( 200), ( 105), ( 211), ( 204), ( 116), (215) of anatase TiO 2 (JCPDS Card No. 21-1272), respectively.14,36 No other phases were detected for all the samples.Based on the Scherrer equation and the broadening of the (101) peak, the average crystallite sizes of anatase TiO 2 were calculated to be 13.8, 12.8, 12.7 and 12.8 nm for TiO 2 , 0.1 Mo/TiO 2 , 0.3 Mo/TiO 2 and 0.5 Mo/TiO 2 , respectively (shown in Table 1).Clearly, the addition of element Mo slightly decreases the crystallite sizes, in accord with the specific surface area measurements, which can be explained by the reason that the external Mo ions retard the growth of TiO 2 crystallites during the preparation.30 The lattice parameters, an important indicator of the structural response to the dopant dissolution, are derived from XRD patterns and listed in Table 1.The a and c axial lengths of the TiO 2 sample are 3.7864 and 9.5047 A, respectively.The a-axial lengths of TiO 2 in the Mo/TiO 2 samples are comparable to that of the TiO 2 sample, while the c-axial lengths and c/a ratios have been reduced, reflecting the lattice contraction of TiO 2 . According to Hume-Rothery's rules for metallic substitutional doping, substitutional doping is favored when the dopant radius varies by 15 of that of the matrix cation.37 Mo 3d core level XPS spectrum of 0.3 Mo/TiO 2 shows that there are Mo 6 and Mo 5 near the surface (Fig. 1D).38 Mo 6 radius (0.073 nm) is slightly smaller while Mo 5 (0.075 nm) is slightly larger than that of Ti 4 (0.0745 nm).37 This suggests that Mo substitutional doping is highly likely in the Mo/TiO 2 samples.From size considerations alone, Mo 5 substitution for Ti 4 would be expected to cause lattice expansion of TiO 2 .Mo 6 substitution would give rise to lattice construction.From valence considerations alone, Mo 6 and Mo 5 with a relatively higher electronegativity would be expected to reduce both the ab plane and c-axis.Because the ab plane is tightly packed, the a-axial is hardly effected.31,37,39 Whereas the c-axis is shortened by the valence effect. The Raman data is shown in Fig. 3. Five typical vibrational modes at around 144 cm -1 (E g (1)), 197 cm -1 (E g (2)), 399 cm -1 (B 1g ), 516 cm -1 (A 1g B 1g (2)) and 639 cm -1 (E g (3)) assigned to anatase TiO 2 are observed for all the photocatalysts.40 Among them, the E g (1) peak is the most intense and the most investigated in the literature, 41 which corresponds to the O-Ti-O bending type vibration 42.The E g (1) peak appears to be increasingly shifted toward higher wavenumbers with increasing the Mo concentrations, accompanied by the broadening of full width at the half-maximum (HWHM).Several effects could cause the variation of position and width of this peak, such as defects in the stoichiometry, 43 phonon confinement in nanoparticles, extrinsic doping 44, pressure and temperature effects.A research reported by Li Bassi and co-worker suggested that the stoichiometry defects in anatase TiO 2 contributed to the peak blue-shift, while the peak width seems to be less affected by the oxygen concentration, 43 which is inconsistent in the case of the present work.Based on the fact that the crystallite sizes of the three Mo-doped samples are almost equal, it can be speculated that the incessant blue-shift and broadening of the E g (1) peak with the Mo concentrations increasing should not be assigned to phonon confinement.Additionally, the pressure and temperature effects can also be ruled out due to the same conditions for Raman analysis.Thus, Mo doping is most likely responsible for the blue-shift and broadening of the E g (1) peak.Mo doping causes the lattice construction, evidenced by XRD analysis, thereby reinforcing the O-Ti-O bending vibration.Based on the results above, it can be concluded that Mo-doped TiO 2 photocatalysts were successfully fabricated by a one-pot hydrothermal method. The UV-vis absorption spectra of the TiO 2 and Mo-doped TiO 2 photocatalysts are shown in Fig. 4A.The TiO 2 photocatalyst only absorbs the light with wavelength lower than 400 nm, in agreement with previous reports.45 After Mo doping, the photocatalysts appear to absorb visible light and the visible-light absorption slightly increases with the Mo concentrations increasing, which can be attributed to the transition from O 2p to Mo 4d and the intra-band transition of between Mo 4d and Ti 3d states 30.The transient photocurrent measurements and fluorescence emission spectroscopy were used to probe the efficiency of photoinduced charge-carrier separation of the photocatalysts.As shown in Fig. 4B.Each electrode exhibits a current response to light, 4C.The weaker fluorescence emission peaks, the higher photoinduced charge-carrier separation efficiency.The peak centered at around 396 cm -1 is assigned to the electron transfer between the conduction band and the valence band.46 The peak height first decreases and then increases with the Mo concentrations increasing.It is the lowest for 0.1 Mo/TiO 2 , further confirming the highest efficiency of the photoinduced charge-carrier separation.Theoretical calculation indicates that Mo doping induces some splits in VB and CB because of the breaking of symmetry of TiO 2 lattice, thereby facilitating the separation of electrons and holes, 30 whereas the excessive Mo 6 ions would be served as a carrier recombination center, 29,47 which explain the observation that the efficiency of the electron-hole separation is the highest at the Mo doping concentration of about 0.1 wt but begins to decrease with further increasing the Mo concentrations.The improved charge transport of the Mo-doped TiO 2 photocatalysts can be very classically confirmed by the decreased hemicycle radius measured by using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), due to the presence of electron donor Mo 5 (Fig. 4D). Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was carried out in a reactor equipped with an online gas chromatograph to monitor products.In addition to oxygen, CO and CH 4 were found to be the main products for CO 2 reduction, no other carbon-containing products were detected by GC, in agreement with previous reports.35 The averaged activities for three independent measurements of the samples are provided in Fig. 5. CO and CH 4 yields increase with irradiation time.At the first hour, CO yield is the lowest for TiO 2 , but it is dramatically increasing.At the fourth and fifth hours CO yield for TiO 2 is already greater than for 0.1 Mo/ TiO 2 and 0.5 Mo/TiO 2 photocatalysts.CH 4 yield for TiO 2 is always lower than for Mo-doped photocatalysts in the whole tests.It is known that the reduction of CO 2 to CO requires two photoinduced electrons and two protons and that CH 4 production needs eight photoinduced electrons and eight protons, involving multiple reaction steps.Because the photoinduced electrons of TiO 2 mainly serve for CO production, the CO yield growth is relatively faster with irradiation time.At the fifth hours, the mean CO yields were detected to be 29, 26, 41 and 23 mol/ g and the mean CH 4 yields were 4, 18, 49 and 11 mol/g for TiO 2 , 0.1 Mo/TiO 2 , 0.3 Mo/TiO 2 and 0.5 Mo/TiO 2 , respectively.Based on carbon conservation, the conversion of CO 2 is calculated to be about 33, 44, 90 and 34 mol after 5 h of irradiation.Fig. 5C shows the CH 4 selectivity over the photocatalysts after 5 h of light irradiation.it is found that the CH 4 selectivity is increased with the Mo concentrations increasing and reaches 54.1 at a Mo concentration of about 0.3 wt.With further increasing the Mo concentrations, the CH 4 selectivity begins to decrease.It is better to compare a product selectivity at the same level of the transformation of reactants.Therefore, the CH 4 selectivity at the CO 2 conversion of 33 mol over the photocatalysts is supplied in Fig. 5D.Here, 33 mol of CO 2 transformation is derived from CO and CH 4 yields according to carbon conservation.The CH 4 selectivity was calculated to be 12.8 , 40.6 , 46.2 and 30.3 for TiO 2 , 0.1 Mo/ TiO 2 , 0.3 Mo/TiO 2 and 0.5 Mo/TiO 2 , respectively.Wang and coworkers reported that the CH 4 selectivity can exceed 95 over ultrafine Pt Nanoparticles on TiO 2 single crystals.23 Therefore, there is room for CH 4 selectivity improvement over Mo-doped TiO 2 by material structure and surface regulation. It is well known that the photoinduced electron-hole separation is a prerequisite for photocatalysis.The 0.1 Mo/TiO 2 photocatalyst exhibits the highest efficiency of photoinduced charge carrier separation, but the activity and selectivity to CH 4 are not the highest, indicating that there should be other factors controlling photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to CH 4 over Mo-doped TiO 2 . In order to explore other possible reasons for the enhanced CH 4 selectivity over Mo-doped TiO 2 , EPR measurements of TiO 2 and 0.3 Mo/TiO 2 before and after the adsorption of CO 2 and H 2 O were carried out at 300 K.As shown in Fig. 6, a relatively stronger signal at g 1.964 is observed for TiO 2 before the adsorption of reactants, which can be assigned to the Ti 3 ions.48,49 A weak signal at g 2.001 corresponds to oxygen vacancies in the lattice of TiO 2 .49,50 After the adsorption of reactants, the Ti 3 signal almost disappears, indicating that Ti 3 spin centers locate at the surface.Whereas a new signal at g 2.08 appear, corresponding to oxygen vacancies at the surface of TiO 2 51.These results suggest that Ti 3 spin centers transform to oxygen vacancy spin centers after the adsorption of reactants.Note that the reactant adsorption has no influence on oxygen vacancies in the lattice.As for 0.3 Mo/TiO 2 before the adsorption of reactants, two differentiable signals can be assigned to Mo 5 with the set of g values g 1.899 and g 1.928, 52,53 which are observably weakened after the adsorption of reactants.At the same time, a new signal at g 1.941 is observed, probably due to the formation of Ti 3 spin centers near Mo ions.It should be note that there is no Ti 3 at the native surface of 0.3 Mo/TiO 2 , implying that the presence of Mo suppresses the Ti 3 generation during the preparation.This can be attributed to the higher electronegativity of Mo (VI) than Ti (III), leading to the transform of Ti 3 to Ti 4 according to the Eq. 2. In sum, Mo doping overtly changes the surface structure of TiO 2 and adjusts the adsorption of reactants on the surface. To identify whether Mo doping adjusts the interaction of CO 2 with catalyst surfaces leading to the higher selectivity to CH 4 over Mo-doped TiO 2 , Photocatalytic CO, formaldehyde, and methanol reductions with H 2 O vapor were carried out over TiO 2 and 0.3 Mo/TiO 2 under the same conditions with CO 2 photoreduction.These reactions were chosen because it was considered by many theoretical calculations that these C1 molecules were intermediates for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.54 As shown in Fig. 7, CH 4 yields over 0.3 Mo/TiO 2 are higher than that over TiO 2 regardless of which C1 molecule is served as the reactant, implying that the enhanced CH 4 selectivity over Mo-doped TiO 2 might not relate with the surface-CO 2 interaction.So far, two pathways for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction were proposed according to whether the hydrogenation or the deoxygenation process is faster.545556 In the fast-hydrogenation pathway, CO 2 is reduced along the path CO 2 HCOOHCH 2 OCH 3 OHCH 4 ; and in the fast-deoxygenation pathway, it follows the path CO 2 COCCH 2 CH 3 CH 4 .Very little CH 4 was produced when CH 3 OH and CH 2 O were served as reactants, whereas CH 4 yields derived from CO reductions are observably higher than those from CO 2 reductions.The results show that photocatalytic CO 2 reduction appears to follow the fast-deoxygenation pathway over TiO 2 and Mo-doped TiO 2 , which will be further evidenced by EPR spin trapping of CH 3 in a NaCO 3 aqueous solution. In the liquid-solid photocatalytic CO 2 reduction system, where CO 2 was dissolved in photocatalyst-dispersed aqueous solutions, carbonates/bicarbonates are the actual reactants in the overall reaction mechanism.57 Thus, sodium carbonate solution was used to simulate the liquid-solid CO 2 reduction system in the work, and the spin-trapping technique was applied to monitor possible radicals.Fig. 8 presents EPR spectra recorded after 1 min of illumination of the photocatalyst dispersions containing DMPO as a spin trap.The signals for DMPO-CH 3 adducts were observed in the presence of sodium carbonate, 57 proving that CH 3 is crucial intermediate for CH 4 generation.Note that the signals for DMPO-OH adducts were also detected, suggesting that H 2 O competes with carbonate for photogenerated holes.According to signal intensity for DMPO-CH 3 adducts, the amount of CH 3 generated first increases and then decreases with the Mo doping concentrations increasing, in the same order as CH 4 yield and selectivity.The result further implied that the enhanced CH 4 did not depend on the interaction between CO 2 molecules and catalyst surfaces.0.5 Mo/TiO 2 exhibits the lower CH 3 production than 0.3 Mo/TiO 2 , due to the decreased electron-hole separation. To examine the interaction of H 2 O molecules with catalyst surfaces, the Fourier infrared spectra of absorbed D 2 O on the surface of the photocatalysts were conducted, where D 2 O was selected to eliminate interference from H 2 O vapor in air and OH groups at the catalyst surface.The self-supporting wafers (15 mg) were first annealed in an IR cell at 473 K under vacuum for 2 h to remove the adsorbed impurities.After the IR cell was cooled naturally, D 2 O vapor were introduced into the cell.Prior to the measurements, the IR cell was evacuated for 15 min to remove gaseous-and physically adsorbed-D 2 O molecules.Fig. 9 shows IR spectra for D 2 O adsorbed on the photocatalysts; the band of the photocatalysts were used as the background.A peak observed at 2720 cm -1 can be assigned to DO groups derived from the dissociative adsorption of D 2 O. 58596061 The peak of DO group was not observed for bare TiO 2 , and the peak height increases with increasing the Mo concentrations.The results show a weak ability to dissociate H 2 O molecules over bare TiO 2 , in agreements with previous reports.62 In contrast, Mo doping promotes the H 2 O dissociation and strengthens the interaction of H 2 O with catalyst surfaces.The peak height of DO group for 0.5 Mo/TiO 2 is higher than that for 0.3 Mo/ TiO 2 , suggesting the more amount of D 2 O dissociated.Note that the peak of DO group was not observed for 0.1 Mo/TiO 2 (not shown in Fig. 9).This is because the amount of DO group generated on 0.1 Mo/ TiO 2 goes beyond the detection limit of the infrared spectrometer.Theoretical calculation shows that the adsorption free energy of H 2 O over MoO x clusters exceed -2.0 eV, implying the high ability to activate H 2 O molecules, 26 which supports the results of this work. In the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O, H 2 O supply protons for CH 4 generation, accompanying water oxidation to produce hydroxyl radicals or O 2 (equ.3-4).As such, the efficiency of proton generation depends on the water oxidation step.Thus, the amount of OH can be also used to assess the proton supply for CO 2 reduction.Herein, DMPO was used as the trapping agent for the detection of OH in water and the results are displayed in Fig. 10.The ESR signals-a 1:2:2:1 quartet pattern, with a splitting of about 1.5 m T characteristic of a DMPO-OH adduct-are clearly observed.52 According to the signal intensity, it can be inferred that the production of OH were promoted by Mo doping, and 0.3 Mo/TiO 2 , whose efficiency of photoinduced charge-carrier separation is not the highest, exhibits the largest OH production, being consistent with the case of CH 4 production from CO 2 reduction.This result also indicates that H 2 O activation by Mo doping plays the key role of H 2 O oxidation that is the semireaction for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O. On the other hand, 0.5 Mo/TiO 2 has a higher ability to H 2 O activation, but OH production is lower than 0.3 Mo/TiO 2 .This is attributed to the decreased photoinduced electron-hole separation. In the CH 4 formation, CO 2 molecules are first adsorbed on the surface of catalysts and react with photoinduced electrons, forming activated adducts.The adducts deoxygenate and were bonded with protons to generate CH 3 and then CH 4 , illustrated in Scheme 1.The adduct generation depends on the photoinduced electron-hole separation.The higher electron-hole separation efficiency, the more adducts generated.On the other hand, if the adducts cannot be bound to protons in time, they will deactivate via vibration relaxation or heat inactivation.In other words, the CH 4 selectivity and yield are at least dominated by the two factors of the proton supply and the electron-hole separation.The ability of Mo-doped TiO 2 to H 2 O activation and dissociation increases with increasing the Mo doping concentrations, whereas the electron-hole separation efficiency first increases and then decreases with the Mo doping concentrations increasing.As such, there is an optimal Mo doping concentration for CH 4 generation.In the work, 0.3 wt of the Mo doping concertation is the best for CH 4 generation.Although 0.1 Mo/TiO 2 has the highest electron-hole separation efficiency, the ability to H 2 O activation and dissociation is relatively weaker, leading to a relatively lower CH 4 selectivity.Whereas the lower electron-hole separation efficiency of 0.5 Mo/TiO 2 results in a decrease in CH 4 selectivity."}, {"llm generation": "0.5 Mo/TiO 2", "source": "N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms and pore size distribution curves of the TiO 2 , 0.1 Mo/TiO 2 , 0.3 Mo/TiO 2 and 0.5 Mo/TiO 2 samples are shown in Fig. 1 A andB.", "context": "N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms and pore size distribution curves of the TiO 2 , 0.1 Mo/TiO 2 , 0.3 Mo/TiO 2 and 0.5 Mo/TiO 2 samples are shown in Fig. 1 A andB.All the isotherms are of the type-IV adsorption with a loop ring of type-H3 and there are no obvious saturation adsorption platforms, indicating the presence of irregular mesopores in the samples.35 The pore size distributions of the photocatalysts are relatively concentrated with the most probable pore sizes at around 10 nm (Fig. 1B).The BET surface area and pore volume of TiO 2 were measured to be 119 m 2 /g and 0.32 cm 3 /g.The addition of Mo increases the surface area and pore volume but has no influence on the average pore size of the samples (Table 1).TEM and EDS mapping images of a representative photocatalyst 0.3 Mo/TiO 2 are shown in Fig. 2. Spherical and square nanocrystals are observed with a particle size of around 10 nm (Fig. 2A).EDS mapping analysis shows that element Mo was uniformly dispersed on the surface of TiO 2 .(Fig. 2 B-D) Fig. 1C shows the characteristic powder-XRD patterns of the samples.The diffraction peaks around 2 of 25.3, 38.0, 47.9, 53.9, 55.1, 62.8, 68.7, 70.4and 75.2correspond to the crystal planes (101), (004), ( 200), ( 105), ( 211), ( 204), ( 116), (215) of anatase TiO 2 (JCPDS Card No. 21-1272), respectively.14,36 No other phases were detected for all the samples.Based on the Scherrer equation and the broadening of the (101) peak, the average crystallite sizes of anatase TiO 2 were calculated to be 13.8, 12.8, 12.7 and 12.8 nm for TiO 2 , 0.1 Mo/TiO 2 , 0.3 Mo/TiO 2 and 0.5 Mo/TiO 2 , respectively (shown in Table 1).Clearly, the addition of element Mo slightly decreases the crystallite sizes, in accord with the specific surface area measurements, which can be explained by the reason that the external Mo ions retard the growth of TiO 2 crystallites during the preparation.30 The lattice parameters, an important indicator of the structural response to the dopant dissolution, are derived from XRD patterns and listed in Table 1.The a and c axial lengths of the TiO 2 sample are 3.7864 and 9.5047 A, respectively.The a-axial lengths of TiO 2 in the Mo/TiO 2 samples are comparable to that of the TiO 2 sample, while the c-axial lengths and c/a ratios have been reduced, reflecting the lattice contraction of TiO 2 . According to Hume-Rothery's rules for metallic substitutional doping, substitutional doping is favored when the dopant radius varies by 15 of that of the matrix cation.37 Mo 3d core level XPS spectrum of 0.3 Mo/TiO 2 shows that there are Mo 6 and Mo 5 near the surface (Fig. 1D).38 Mo 6 radius (0.073 nm) is slightly smaller while Mo 5 (0.075 nm) is slightly larger than that of Ti 4 (0.0745 nm).37 This suggests that Mo substitutional doping is highly likely in the Mo/TiO 2 samples.From size considerations alone, Mo 5 substitution for Ti 4 would be expected to cause lattice expansion of TiO 2 .Mo 6 substitution would give rise to lattice construction.From valence considerations alone, Mo 6 and Mo 5 with a relatively higher electronegativity would be expected to reduce both the ab plane and c-axis.Because the ab plane is tightly packed, the a-axial is hardly effected.31,37,39 Whereas the c-axis is shortened by the valence effect. The Raman data is shown in Fig. 3. Five typical vibrational modes at around 144 cm -1 (E g (1)), 197 cm -1 (E g (2)), 399 cm -1 (B 1g ), 516 cm -1 (A 1g B 1g (2)) and 639 cm -1 (E g (3)) assigned to anatase TiO 2 are observed for all the photocatalysts.40 Among them, the E g (1) peak is the most intense and the most investigated in the literature, 41 which corresponds to the O-Ti-O bending type vibration 42.The E g (1) peak appears to be increasingly shifted toward higher wavenumbers with increasing the Mo concentrations, accompanied by the broadening of full width at the half-maximum (HWHM).Several effects could cause the variation of position and width of this peak, such as defects in the stoichiometry, 43 phonon confinement in nanoparticles, extrinsic doping 44, pressure and temperature effects.A research reported by Li Bassi and co-worker suggested that the stoichiometry defects in anatase TiO 2 contributed to the peak blue-shift, while the peak width seems to be less affected by the oxygen concentration, 43 which is inconsistent in the case of the present work.Based on the fact that the crystallite sizes of the three Mo-doped samples are almost equal, it can be speculated that the incessant blue-shift and broadening of the E g (1) peak with the Mo concentrations increasing should not be assigned to phonon confinement.Additionally, the pressure and temperature effects can also be ruled out due to the same conditions for Raman analysis.Thus, Mo doping is most likely responsible for the blue-shift and broadening of the E g (1) peak.Mo doping causes the lattice construction, evidenced by XRD analysis, thereby reinforcing the O-Ti-O bending vibration.Based on the results above, it can be concluded that Mo-doped TiO 2 photocatalysts were successfully fabricated by a one-pot hydrothermal method. The UV-vis absorption spectra of the TiO 2 and Mo-doped TiO 2 photocatalysts are shown in Fig. 4A.The TiO 2 photocatalyst only absorbs the light with wavelength lower than 400 nm, in agreement with previous reports.45 After Mo doping, the photocatalysts appear to absorb visible light and the visible-light absorption slightly increases with the Mo concentrations increasing, which can be attributed to the transition from O 2p to Mo 4d and the intra-band transition of between Mo 4d and Ti 3d states 30.The transient photocurrent measurements and fluorescence emission spectroscopy were used to probe the efficiency of photoinduced charge-carrier separation of the photocatalysts.As shown in Fig. 4B.Each electrode exhibits a current response to light, 4C.The weaker fluorescence emission peaks, the higher photoinduced charge-carrier separation efficiency.The peak centered at around 396 cm -1 is assigned to the electron transfer between the conduction band and the valence band.46 The peak height first decreases and then increases with the Mo concentrations increasing.It is the lowest for 0.1 Mo/TiO 2 , further confirming the highest efficiency of the photoinduced charge-carrier separation.Theoretical calculation indicates that Mo doping induces some splits in VB and CB because of the breaking of symmetry of TiO 2 lattice, thereby facilitating the separation of electrons and holes, 30 whereas the excessive Mo 6 ions would be served as a carrier recombination center, 29,47 which explain the observation that the efficiency of the electron-hole separation is the highest at the Mo doping concentration of about 0.1 wt but begins to decrease with further increasing the Mo concentrations.The improved charge transport of the Mo-doped TiO 2 photocatalysts can be very classically confirmed by the decreased hemicycle radius measured by using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), due to the presence of electron donor Mo 5 (Fig. 4D). Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was carried out in a reactor equipped with an online gas chromatograph to monitor products.In addition to oxygen, CO and CH 4 were found to be the main products for CO 2 reduction, no other carbon-containing products were detected by GC, in agreement with previous reports.35 The averaged activities for three independent measurements of the samples are provided in Fig. 5. CO and CH 4 yields increase with irradiation time.At the first hour, CO yield is the lowest for TiO 2 , but it is dramatically increasing.At the fourth and fifth hours CO yield for TiO 2 is already greater than for 0.1 Mo/ TiO 2 and 0.5 Mo/TiO 2 photocatalysts.CH 4 yield for TiO 2 is always lower than for Mo-doped photocatalysts in the whole tests.It is known that the reduction of CO 2 to CO requires two photoinduced electrons and two protons and that CH 4 production needs eight photoinduced electrons and eight protons, involving multiple reaction steps.Because the photoinduced electrons of TiO 2 mainly serve for CO production, the CO yield growth is relatively faster with irradiation time.At the fifth hours, the mean CO yields were detected to be 29, 26, 41 and 23 mol/ g and the mean CH 4 yields were 4, 18, 49 and 11 mol/g for TiO 2 , 0.1 Mo/TiO 2 , 0.3 Mo/TiO 2 and 0.5 Mo/TiO 2 , respectively.Based on carbon conservation, the conversion of CO 2 is calculated to be about 33, 44, 90 and 34 mol after 5 h of irradiation.Fig. 5C shows the CH 4 selectivity over the photocatalysts after 5 h of light irradiation.it is found that the CH 4 selectivity is increased with the Mo concentrations increasing and reaches 54.1 at a Mo concentration of about 0.3 wt.With further increasing the Mo concentrations, the CH 4 selectivity begins to decrease.It is better to compare a product selectivity at the same level of the transformation of reactants.Therefore, the CH 4 selectivity at the CO 2 conversion of 33 mol over the photocatalysts is supplied in Fig. 5D.Here, 33 mol of CO 2 transformation is derived from CO and CH 4 yields according to carbon conservation.The CH 4 selectivity was calculated to be 12.8 , 40.6 , 46.2 and 30.3 for TiO 2 , 0.1 Mo/ TiO 2 , 0.3 Mo/TiO 2 and 0.5 Mo/TiO 2 , respectively.Wang and coworkers reported that the CH 4 selectivity can exceed 95 over ultrafine Pt Nanoparticles on TiO 2 single crystals.23 Therefore, there is room for CH 4 selectivity improvement over Mo-doped TiO 2 by material structure and surface regulation. It is well known that the photoinduced electron-hole separation is a prerequisite for photocatalysis.The 0.1 Mo/TiO 2 photocatalyst exhibits the highest efficiency of photoinduced charge carrier separation, but the activity and selectivity to CH 4 are not the highest, indicating that there should be other factors controlling photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to CH 4 over Mo-doped TiO 2 . In order to explore other possible reasons for the enhanced CH 4 selectivity over Mo-doped TiO 2 , EPR measurements of TiO 2 and 0.3 Mo/TiO 2 before and after the adsorption of CO 2 and H 2 O were carried out at 300 K.As shown in Fig. 6, a relatively stronger signal at g 1.964 is observed for TiO 2 before the adsorption of reactants, which can be assigned to the Ti 3 ions.48,49 A weak signal at g 2.001 corresponds to oxygen vacancies in the lattice of TiO 2 .49,50 After the adsorption of reactants, the Ti 3 signal almost disappears, indicating that Ti 3 spin centers locate at the surface.Whereas a new signal at g 2.08 appear, corresponding to oxygen vacancies at the surface of TiO 2 51.These results suggest that Ti 3 spin centers transform to oxygen vacancy spin centers after the adsorption of reactants.Note that the reactant adsorption has no influence on oxygen vacancies in the lattice.As for 0.3 Mo/TiO 2 before the adsorption of reactants, two differentiable signals can be assigned to Mo 5 with the set of g values g 1.899 and g 1.928, 52,53 which are observably weakened after the adsorption of reactants.At the same time, a new signal at g 1.941 is observed, probably due to the formation of Ti 3 spin centers near Mo ions.It should be note that there is no Ti 3 at the native surface of 0.3 Mo/TiO 2 , implying that the presence of Mo suppresses the Ti 3 generation during the preparation.This can be attributed to the higher electronegativity of Mo (VI) than Ti (III), leading to the transform of Ti 3 to Ti 4 according to the Eq. 2. In sum, Mo doping overtly changes the surface structure of TiO 2 and adjusts the adsorption of reactants on the surface. To identify whether Mo doping adjusts the interaction of CO 2 with catalyst surfaces leading to the higher selectivity to CH 4 over Mo-doped TiO 2 , Photocatalytic CO, formaldehyde, and methanol reductions with H 2 O vapor were carried out over TiO 2 and 0.3 Mo/TiO 2 under the same conditions with CO 2 photoreduction.These reactions were chosen because it was considered by many theoretical calculations that these C1 molecules were intermediates for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.54 As shown in Fig. 7, CH 4 yields over 0.3 Mo/TiO 2 are higher than that over TiO 2 regardless of which C1 molecule is served as the reactant, implying that the enhanced CH 4 selectivity over Mo-doped TiO 2 might not relate with the surface-CO 2 interaction.So far, two pathways for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction were proposed according to whether the hydrogenation or the deoxygenation process is faster.545556 In the fast-hydrogenation pathway, CO 2 is reduced along the path CO 2 HCOOHCH 2 OCH 3 OHCH 4 ; and in the fast-deoxygenation pathway, it follows the path CO 2 COCCH 2 CH 3 CH 4 .Very little CH 4 was produced when CH 3 OH and CH 2 O were served as reactants, whereas CH 4 yields derived from CO reductions are observably higher than those from CO 2 reductions.The results show that photocatalytic CO 2 reduction appears to follow the fast-deoxygenation pathway over TiO 2 and Mo-doped TiO 2 , which will be further evidenced by EPR spin trapping of CH 3 in a NaCO 3 aqueous solution. In the liquid-solid photocatalytic CO 2 reduction system, where CO 2 was dissolved in photocatalyst-dispersed aqueous solutions, carbonates/bicarbonates are the actual reactants in the overall reaction mechanism.57 Thus, sodium carbonate solution was used to simulate the liquid-solid CO 2 reduction system in the work, and the spin-trapping technique was applied to monitor possible radicals.Fig. 8 presents EPR spectra recorded after 1 min of illumination of the photocatalyst dispersions containing DMPO as a spin trap.The signals for DMPO-CH 3 adducts were observed in the presence of sodium carbonate, 57 proving that CH 3 is crucial intermediate for CH 4 generation.Note that the signals for DMPO-OH adducts were also detected, suggesting that H 2 O competes with carbonate for photogenerated holes.According to signal intensity for DMPO-CH 3 adducts, the amount of CH 3 generated first increases and then decreases with the Mo doping concentrations increasing, in the same order as CH 4 yield and selectivity.The result further implied that the enhanced CH 4 did not depend on the interaction between CO 2 molecules and catalyst surfaces.0.5 Mo/TiO 2 exhibits the lower CH 3 production than 0.3 Mo/TiO 2 , due to the decreased electron-hole separation. To examine the interaction of H 2 O molecules with catalyst surfaces, the Fourier infrared spectra of absorbed D 2 O on the surface of the photocatalysts were conducted, where D 2 O was selected to eliminate interference from H 2 O vapor in air and OH groups at the catalyst surface.The self-supporting wafers (15 mg) were first annealed in an IR cell at 473 K under vacuum for 2 h to remove the adsorbed impurities.After the IR cell was cooled naturally, D 2 O vapor were introduced into the cell.Prior to the measurements, the IR cell was evacuated for 15 min to remove gaseous-and physically adsorbed-D 2 O molecules.Fig. 9 shows IR spectra for D 2 O adsorbed on the photocatalysts; the band of the photocatalysts were used as the background.A peak observed at 2720 cm -1 can be assigned to DO groups derived from the dissociative adsorption of D 2 O. 58596061 The peak of DO group was not observed for bare TiO 2 , and the peak height increases with increasing the Mo concentrations.The results show a weak ability to dissociate H 2 O molecules over bare TiO 2 , in agreements with previous reports.62 In contrast, Mo doping promotes the H 2 O dissociation and strengthens the interaction of H 2 O with catalyst surfaces.The peak height of DO group for 0.5 Mo/TiO 2 is higher than that for 0.3 Mo/ TiO 2 , suggesting the more amount of D 2 O dissociated.Note that the peak of DO group was not observed for 0.1 Mo/TiO 2 (not shown in Fig. 9).This is because the amount of DO group generated on 0.1 Mo/ TiO 2 goes beyond the detection limit of the infrared spectrometer.Theoretical calculation shows that the adsorption free energy of H 2 O over MoO x clusters exceed -2.0 eV, implying the high ability to activate H 2 O molecules, 26 which supports the results of this work. In the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O, H 2 O supply protons for CH 4 generation, accompanying water oxidation to produce hydroxyl radicals or O 2 (equ.3-4).As such, the efficiency of proton generation depends on the water oxidation step.Thus, the amount of OH can be also used to assess the proton supply for CO 2 reduction.Herein, DMPO was used as the trapping agent for the detection of OH in water and the results are displayed in Fig. 10.The ESR signals-a 1:2:2:1 quartet pattern, with a splitting of about 1.5 m T characteristic of a DMPO-OH adduct-are clearly observed.52 According to the signal intensity, it can be inferred that the production of OH were promoted by Mo doping, and 0.3 Mo/TiO 2 , whose efficiency of photoinduced charge-carrier separation is not the highest, exhibits the largest OH production, being consistent with the case of CH 4 production from CO 2 reduction.This result also indicates that H 2 O activation by Mo doping plays the key role of H 2 O oxidation that is the semireaction for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O. On the other hand, 0.5 Mo/TiO 2 has a higher ability to H 2 O activation, but OH production is lower than 0.3 Mo/TiO 2 .This is attributed to the decreased photoinduced electron-hole separation. In the CH 4 formation, CO 2 molecules are first adsorbed on the surface of catalysts and react with photoinduced electrons, forming activated adducts.The adducts deoxygenate and were bonded with protons to generate CH 3 and then CH 4 , illustrated in Scheme 1.The adduct generation depends on the photoinduced electron-hole separation.The higher electron-hole separation efficiency, the more adducts generated.On the other hand, if the adducts cannot be bound to protons in time, they will deactivate via vibration relaxation or heat inactivation.In other words, the CH 4 selectivity and yield are at least dominated by the two factors of the proton supply and the electron-hole separation.The ability of Mo-doped TiO 2 to H 2 O activation and dissociation increases with increasing the Mo doping concentrations, whereas the electron-hole separation efficiency first increases and then decreases with the Mo doping concentrations increasing.As such, there is an optimal Mo doping concentration for CH 4 generation.In the work, 0.3 wt of the Mo doping concertation is the best for CH 4 generation.Although 0.1 Mo/TiO 2 has the highest electron-hole separation efficiency, the ability to H 2 O activation and dissociation is relatively weaker, leading to a relatively lower CH 4 selectivity.Whereas the lower electron-hole separation efficiency of 0.5 Mo/TiO 2 results in a decrease in CH 4 selectivity."}, {"llm generation": "Pt Nanoparticles", "source": "Wang and coworkers reported that the CH 4 selectivity can exceed 95 over ultrafine Pt Nanoparticles on TiO 2 single crystals.", "context": "N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms and pore size distribution curves of the TiO 2 , 0.1 Mo/TiO 2 , 0.3 Mo/TiO 2 and 0.5 Mo/TiO 2 samples are shown in Fig. 1 A andB.All the isotherms are of the type-IV adsorption with a loop ring of type-H3 and there are no obvious saturation adsorption platforms, indicating the presence of irregular mesopores in the samples.35 The pore size distributions of the photocatalysts are relatively concentrated with the most probable pore sizes at around 10 nm (Fig. 1B).The BET surface area and pore volume of TiO 2 were measured to be 119 m 2 /g and 0.32 cm 3 /g.The addition of Mo increases the surface area and pore volume but has no influence on the average pore size of the samples (Table 1).TEM and EDS mapping images of a representative photocatalyst 0.3 Mo/TiO 2 are shown in Fig. 2. Spherical and square nanocrystals are observed with a particle size of around 10 nm (Fig. 2A).EDS mapping analysis shows that element Mo was uniformly dispersed on the surface of TiO 2 .(Fig. 2 B-D) Fig. 1C shows the characteristic powder-XRD patterns of the samples.The diffraction peaks around 2 of 25.3, 38.0, 47.9, 53.9, 55.1, 62.8, 68.7, 70.4and 75.2correspond to the crystal planes (101), (004), ( 200), ( 105), ( 211), ( 204), ( 116), (215) of anatase TiO 2 (JCPDS Card No. 21-1272), respectively.14,36 No other phases were detected for all the samples.Based on the Scherrer equation and the broadening of the (101) peak, the average crystallite sizes of anatase TiO 2 were calculated to be 13.8, 12.8, 12.7 and 12.8 nm for TiO 2 , 0.1 Mo/TiO 2 , 0.3 Mo/TiO 2 and 0.5 Mo/TiO 2 , respectively (shown in Table 1).Clearly, the addition of element Mo slightly decreases the crystallite sizes, in accord with the specific surface area measurements, which can be explained by the reason that the external Mo ions retard the growth of TiO 2 crystallites during the preparation.30 The lattice parameters, an important indicator of the structural response to the dopant dissolution, are derived from XRD patterns and listed in Table 1.The a and c axial lengths of the TiO 2 sample are 3.7864 and 9.5047 A, respectively.The a-axial lengths of TiO 2 in the Mo/TiO 2 samples are comparable to that of the TiO 2 sample, while the c-axial lengths and c/a ratios have been reduced, reflecting the lattice contraction of TiO 2 . According to Hume-Rothery's rules for metallic substitutional doping, substitutional doping is favored when the dopant radius varies by 15 of that of the matrix cation.37 Mo 3d core level XPS spectrum of 0.3 Mo/TiO 2 shows that there are Mo 6 and Mo 5 near the surface (Fig. 1D).38 Mo 6 radius (0.073 nm) is slightly smaller while Mo 5 (0.075 nm) is slightly larger than that of Ti 4 (0.0745 nm).37 This suggests that Mo substitutional doping is highly likely in the Mo/TiO 2 samples.From size considerations alone, Mo 5 substitution for Ti 4 would be expected to cause lattice expansion of TiO 2 .Mo 6 substitution would give rise to lattice construction.From valence considerations alone, Mo 6 and Mo 5 with a relatively higher electronegativity would be expected to reduce both the ab plane and c-axis.Because the ab plane is tightly packed, the a-axial is hardly effected.31,37,39 Whereas the c-axis is shortened by the valence effect. The Raman data is shown in Fig. 3. Five typical vibrational modes at around 144 cm -1 (E g (1)), 197 cm -1 (E g (2)), 399 cm -1 (B 1g ), 516 cm -1 (A 1g B 1g (2)) and 639 cm -1 (E g (3)) assigned to anatase TiO 2 are observed for all the photocatalysts.40 Among them, the E g (1) peak is the most intense and the most investigated in the literature, 41 which corresponds to the O-Ti-O bending type vibration 42.The E g (1) peak appears to be increasingly shifted toward higher wavenumbers with increasing the Mo concentrations, accompanied by the broadening of full width at the half-maximum (HWHM).Several effects could cause the variation of position and width of this peak, such as defects in the stoichiometry, 43 phonon confinement in nanoparticles, extrinsic doping 44, pressure and temperature effects.A research reported by Li Bassi and co-worker suggested that the stoichiometry defects in anatase TiO 2 contributed to the peak blue-shift, while the peak width seems to be less affected by the oxygen concentration, 43 which is inconsistent in the case of the present work.Based on the fact that the crystallite sizes of the three Mo-doped samples are almost equal, it can be speculated that the incessant blue-shift and broadening of the E g (1) peak with the Mo concentrations increasing should not be assigned to phonon confinement.Additionally, the pressure and temperature effects can also be ruled out due to the same conditions for Raman analysis.Thus, Mo doping is most likely responsible for the blue-shift and broadening of the E g (1) peak.Mo doping causes the lattice construction, evidenced by XRD analysis, thereby reinforcing the O-Ti-O bending vibration.Based on the results above, it can be concluded that Mo-doped TiO 2 photocatalysts were successfully fabricated by a one-pot hydrothermal method. The UV-vis absorption spectra of the TiO 2 and Mo-doped TiO 2 photocatalysts are shown in Fig. 4A.The TiO 2 photocatalyst only absorbs the light with wavelength lower than 400 nm, in agreement with previous reports.45 After Mo doping, the photocatalysts appear to absorb visible light and the visible-light absorption slightly increases with the Mo concentrations increasing, which can be attributed to the transition from O 2p to Mo 4d and the intra-band transition of between Mo 4d and Ti 3d states 30.The transient photocurrent measurements and fluorescence emission spectroscopy were used to probe the efficiency of photoinduced charge-carrier separation of the photocatalysts.As shown in Fig. 4B.Each electrode exhibits a current response to light, 4C.The weaker fluorescence emission peaks, the higher photoinduced charge-carrier separation efficiency.The peak centered at around 396 cm -1 is assigned to the electron transfer between the conduction band and the valence band.46 The peak height first decreases and then increases with the Mo concentrations increasing.It is the lowest for 0.1 Mo/TiO 2 , further confirming the highest efficiency of the photoinduced charge-carrier separation.Theoretical calculation indicates that Mo doping induces some splits in VB and CB because of the breaking of symmetry of TiO 2 lattice, thereby facilitating the separation of electrons and holes, 30 whereas the excessive Mo 6 ions would be served as a carrier recombination center, 29,47 which explain the observation that the efficiency of the electron-hole separation is the highest at the Mo doping concentration of about 0.1 wt but begins to decrease with further increasing the Mo concentrations.The improved charge transport of the Mo-doped TiO 2 photocatalysts can be very classically confirmed by the decreased hemicycle radius measured by using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), due to the presence of electron donor Mo 5 (Fig. 4D). Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was carried out in a reactor equipped with an online gas chromatograph to monitor products.In addition to oxygen, CO and CH 4 were found to be the main products for CO 2 reduction, no other carbon-containing products were detected by GC, in agreement with previous reports.35 The averaged activities for three independent measurements of the samples are provided in Fig. 5. CO and CH 4 yields increase with irradiation time.At the first hour, CO yield is the lowest for TiO 2 , but it is dramatically increasing.At the fourth and fifth hours CO yield for TiO 2 is already greater than for 0.1 Mo/ TiO 2 and 0.5 Mo/TiO 2 photocatalysts.CH 4 yield for TiO 2 is always lower than for Mo-doped photocatalysts in the whole tests.It is known that the reduction of CO 2 to CO requires two photoinduced electrons and two protons and that CH 4 production needs eight photoinduced electrons and eight protons, involving multiple reaction steps.Because the photoinduced electrons of TiO 2 mainly serve for CO production, the CO yield growth is relatively faster with irradiation time.At the fifth hours, the mean CO yields were detected to be 29, 26, 41 and 23 mol/ g and the mean CH 4 yields were 4, 18, 49 and 11 mol/g for TiO 2 , 0.1 Mo/TiO 2 , 0.3 Mo/TiO 2 and 0.5 Mo/TiO 2 , respectively.Based on carbon conservation, the conversion of CO 2 is calculated to be about 33, 44, 90 and 34 mol after 5 h of irradiation.Fig. 5C shows the CH 4 selectivity over the photocatalysts after 5 h of light irradiation.it is found that the CH 4 selectivity is increased with the Mo concentrations increasing and reaches 54.1 at a Mo concentration of about 0.3 wt.With further increasing the Mo concentrations, the CH 4 selectivity begins to decrease.It is better to compare a product selectivity at the same level of the transformation of reactants.Therefore, the CH 4 selectivity at the CO 2 conversion of 33 mol over the photocatalysts is supplied in Fig. 5D.Here, 33 mol of CO 2 transformation is derived from CO and CH 4 yields according to carbon conservation.The CH 4 selectivity was calculated to be 12.8 , 40.6 , 46.2 and 30.3 for TiO 2 , 0.1 Mo/ TiO 2 , 0.3 Mo/TiO 2 and 0.5 Mo/TiO 2 , respectively.Wang and coworkers reported that the CH 4 selectivity can exceed 95 over ultrafine Pt Nanoparticles on TiO 2 single crystals.23 Therefore, there is room for CH 4 selectivity improvement over Mo-doped TiO 2 by material structure and surface regulation. It is well known that the photoinduced electron-hole separation is a prerequisite for photocatalysis.The 0.1 Mo/TiO 2 photocatalyst exhibits the highest efficiency of photoinduced charge carrier separation, but the activity and selectivity to CH 4 are not the highest, indicating that there should be other factors controlling photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to CH 4 over Mo-doped TiO 2 . In order to explore other possible reasons for the enhanced CH 4 selectivity over Mo-doped TiO 2 , EPR measurements of TiO 2 and 0.3 Mo/TiO 2 before and after the adsorption of CO 2 and H 2 O were carried out at 300 K.As shown in Fig. 6, a relatively stronger signal at g 1.964 is observed for TiO 2 before the adsorption of reactants, which can be assigned to the Ti 3 ions.48,49 A weak signal at g 2.001 corresponds to oxygen vacancies in the lattice of TiO 2 .49,50 After the adsorption of reactants, the Ti 3 signal almost disappears, indicating that Ti 3 spin centers locate at the surface.Whereas a new signal at g 2.08 appear, corresponding to oxygen vacancies at the surface of TiO 2 51.These results suggest that Ti 3 spin centers transform to oxygen vacancy spin centers after the adsorption of reactants.Note that the reactant adsorption has no influence on oxygen vacancies in the lattice.As for 0.3 Mo/TiO 2 before the adsorption of reactants, two differentiable signals can be assigned to Mo 5 with the set of g values g 1.899 and g 1.928, 52,53 which are observably weakened after the adsorption of reactants.At the same time, a new signal at g 1.941 is observed, probably due to the formation of Ti 3 spin centers near Mo ions.It should be note that there is no Ti 3 at the native surface of 0.3 Mo/TiO 2 , implying that the presence of Mo suppresses the Ti 3 generation during the preparation.This can be attributed to the higher electronegativity of Mo (VI) than Ti (III), leading to the transform of Ti 3 to Ti 4 according to the Eq. 2. In sum, Mo doping overtly changes the surface structure of TiO 2 and adjusts the adsorption of reactants on the surface. To identify whether Mo doping adjusts the interaction of CO 2 with catalyst surfaces leading to the higher selectivity to CH 4 over Mo-doped TiO 2 , Photocatalytic CO, formaldehyde, and methanol reductions with H 2 O vapor were carried out over TiO 2 and 0.3 Mo/TiO 2 under the same conditions with CO 2 photoreduction.These reactions were chosen because it was considered by many theoretical calculations that these C1 molecules were intermediates for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.54 As shown in Fig. 7, CH 4 yields over 0.3 Mo/TiO 2 are higher than that over TiO 2 regardless of which C1 molecule is served as the reactant, implying that the enhanced CH 4 selectivity over Mo-doped TiO 2 might not relate with the surface-CO 2 interaction.So far, two pathways for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction were proposed according to whether the hydrogenation or the deoxygenation process is faster.545556 In the fast-hydrogenation pathway, CO 2 is reduced along the path CO 2 HCOOHCH 2 OCH 3 OHCH 4 ; and in the fast-deoxygenation pathway, it follows the path CO 2 COCCH 2 CH 3 CH 4 .Very little CH 4 was produced when CH 3 OH and CH 2 O were served as reactants, whereas CH 4 yields derived from CO reductions are observably higher than those from CO 2 reductions.The results show that photocatalytic CO 2 reduction appears to follow the fast-deoxygenation pathway over TiO 2 and Mo-doped TiO 2 , which will be further evidenced by EPR spin trapping of CH 3 in a NaCO 3 aqueous solution. In the liquid-solid photocatalytic CO 2 reduction system, where CO 2 was dissolved in photocatalyst-dispersed aqueous solutions, carbonates/bicarbonates are the actual reactants in the overall reaction mechanism.57 Thus, sodium carbonate solution was used to simulate the liquid-solid CO 2 reduction system in the work, and the spin-trapping technique was applied to monitor possible radicals.Fig. 8 presents EPR spectra recorded after 1 min of illumination of the photocatalyst dispersions containing DMPO as a spin trap.The signals for DMPO-CH 3 adducts were observed in the presence of sodium carbonate, 57 proving that CH 3 is crucial intermediate for CH 4 generation.Note that the signals for DMPO-OH adducts were also detected, suggesting that H 2 O competes with carbonate for photogenerated holes.According to signal intensity for DMPO-CH 3 adducts, the amount of CH 3 generated first increases and then decreases with the Mo doping concentrations increasing, in the same order as CH 4 yield and selectivity.The result further implied that the enhanced CH 4 did not depend on the interaction between CO 2 molecules and catalyst surfaces.0.5 Mo/TiO 2 exhibits the lower CH 3 production than 0.3 Mo/TiO 2 , due to the decreased electron-hole separation. To examine the interaction of H 2 O molecules with catalyst surfaces, the Fourier infrared spectra of absorbed D 2 O on the surface of the photocatalysts were conducted, where D 2 O was selected to eliminate interference from H 2 O vapor in air and OH groups at the catalyst surface.The self-supporting wafers (15 mg) were first annealed in an IR cell at 473 K under vacuum for 2 h to remove the adsorbed impurities.After the IR cell was cooled naturally, D 2 O vapor were introduced into the cell.Prior to the measurements, the IR cell was evacuated for 15 min to remove gaseous-and physically adsorbed-D 2 O molecules.Fig. 9 shows IR spectra for D 2 O adsorbed on the photocatalysts; the band of the photocatalysts were used as the background.A peak observed at 2720 cm -1 can be assigned to DO groups derived from the dissociative adsorption of D 2 O. 58596061 The peak of DO group was not observed for bare TiO 2 , and the peak height increases with increasing the Mo concentrations.The results show a weak ability to dissociate H 2 O molecules over bare TiO 2 , in agreements with previous reports.62 In contrast, Mo doping promotes the H 2 O dissociation and strengthens the interaction of H 2 O with catalyst surfaces.The peak height of DO group for 0.5 Mo/TiO 2 is higher than that for 0.3 Mo/ TiO 2 , suggesting the more amount of D 2 O dissociated.Note that the peak of DO group was not observed for 0.1 Mo/TiO 2 (not shown in Fig. 9).This is because the amount of DO group generated on 0.1 Mo/ TiO 2 goes beyond the detection limit of the infrared spectrometer.Theoretical calculation shows that the adsorption free energy of H 2 O over MoO x clusters exceed -2.0 eV, implying the high ability to activate H 2 O molecules, 26 which supports the results of this work. In the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O, H 2 O supply protons for CH 4 generation, accompanying water oxidation to produce hydroxyl radicals or O 2 (equ.3-4).As such, the efficiency of proton generation depends on the water oxidation step.Thus, the amount of OH can be also used to assess the proton supply for CO 2 reduction.Herein, DMPO was used as the trapping agent for the detection of OH in water and the results are displayed in Fig. 10.The ESR signals-a 1:2:2:1 quartet pattern, with a splitting of about 1.5 m T characteristic of a DMPO-OH adduct-are clearly observed.52 According to the signal intensity, it can be inferred that the production of OH were promoted by Mo doping, and 0.3 Mo/TiO 2 , whose efficiency of photoinduced charge-carrier separation is not the highest, exhibits the largest OH production, being consistent with the case of CH 4 production from CO 2 reduction.This result also indicates that H 2 O activation by Mo doping plays the key role of H 2 O oxidation that is the semireaction for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O. On the other hand, 0.5 Mo/TiO 2 has a higher ability to H 2 O activation, but OH production is lower than 0.3 Mo/TiO 2 .This is attributed to the decreased photoinduced electron-hole separation. In the CH 4 formation, CO 2 molecules are first adsorbed on the surface of catalysts and react with photoinduced electrons, forming activated adducts.The adducts deoxygenate and were bonded with protons to generate CH 3 and then CH 4 , illustrated in Scheme 1.The adduct generation depends on the photoinduced electron-hole separation.The higher electron-hole separation efficiency, the more adducts generated.On the other hand, if the adducts cannot be bound to protons in time, they will deactivate via vibration relaxation or heat inactivation.In other words, the CH 4 selectivity and yield are at least dominated by the two factors of the proton supply and the electron-hole separation.The ability of Mo-doped TiO 2 to H 2 O activation and dissociation increases with increasing the Mo doping concentrations, whereas the electron-hole separation efficiency first increases and then decreases with the Mo doping concentrations increasing.As such, there is an optimal Mo doping concentration for CH 4 generation.In the work, 0.3 wt of the Mo doping concertation is the best for CH 4 generation.Although 0.1 Mo/TiO 2 has the highest electron-hole separation efficiency, the ability to H 2 O activation and dissociation is relatively weaker, leading to a relatively lower CH 4 selectivity.Whereas the lower electron-hole separation efficiency of 0.5 Mo/TiO 2 results in a decrease in CH 4 selectivity."}, {"llm generation": "Mo-doped TiO 2 photocatalysts", "source": "In summary, Mo-doped TiO 2 photocatalysts were successfully prepared via a one-pot hydrothermal method at 473 K, characterized by XRD and Raman spectroscopy techniques revealing the lattice contraction of anatase TiO 2 .", "context": "In summary, Mo-doped TiO 2 photocatalysts were successfully prepared via a one-pot hydrothermal method at 473 K, characterized by XRD and Raman spectroscopy techniques revealing the lattice contraction of anatase TiO 2 .Element Mo exists in the form of Mo (VI) and Mo (V), which suppresses the formation of Ti 3 at the surface of Modoped TiO 2 .The CH 4 selectivity is increased with the Mo concentrations increasing and reaches 54.1 at a Mo concentration of about 0.3 wt, which can be attributed to the promoted electron-hole separation and proton supply.With further increasing the Mo concentrations, the CH 4 selectivity begins to decrease due to a decrease in the electron-hole separation efficiency.Photocatalytic CO, formaldehyde, and methanol reductions with H 2 O and CH 3 trapping indicate that the enhanced CH 4 selectivity over Mo-doped TiO 2 is not directly related with the interaction of CO 2 with catalyst surfaces.These reaction results also imply that photocatalytic CO 2 reduction over TiO 2based catalysts might follow the fast-deoxygenation pathway (eg.CO 2 COCCH 2 CH 3 CH 4 ).The present work supplies a guide to explore cheap modifiers for selective photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to CH 4 .
