Ag/TiO 2 nanoparticles were produced by a photodeposition method.By using the above synthetic TiO 2 nanoparticles as the catalyst support, 1 g of TiO 2 was dispersed in an oxalic acid aqueous solution and sonicated for 15 min, then a predetermined amount of AgNO 3 was added to the solution and stirred for 2 hours to form a homogeneous solution.Then this solution was irradiated on an ultraviolet lamp (PHILIPS TUV 25 W G2578 bactericidal lamp) for 4 hours under stirring at 500 rpm at room temperature.When its colour changed from white to reddish brown, the suspension was centrifuged at 10 000 rpm and washed several times with deionized water.The xerogel was transferred to an electronic vacuum oven and dried overnight at 60 C. XRD measurements were performed on a D8 diffractometer from Bruker instruments (Cu K radiation, 0.15406 nm) operated at 40 kV and 25 mA.The diffractograms were collected in the 2 range from 20 to 80in steps of 0.02per min with a count time of 20 s at each point.The crystalline phase can be determined from the integration intensities of the anatase and rutile phases corresponding to (101), ( 110) and (120), respectively.The average crystalline sizes were determined according to the Debye-Scherrer equation using the full width half maximum data of each phase.The nanoparticle average crystalline size of TiO 2 was determined according to the 2 25.3(101)face.The SEM morphological analysis of the samples was carried out using a scanning electron microscope (Quanta 200 F FEI). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed using a JEM 2100 F transmission electron microscope equipped with EDX at an operating voltage of 200 kV.The TEM samples were prepared by sonication of the powders in absolute alcohol for 15 minutes and subsequently dispersed on carbon coated copper grids dried at room temperature.UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-vis DSR) were recorded using a SHIMADU UV-2550 UV-vis spectrophotometer with an integrating sphere attachment for the diffuse reflectance in the range of 300-800 nm and using BaSO 4 powder as the reference.The photoluminescence (PL) spectrum was recorded using a Perkin-Elmer LS55 fluorescence spectrometer at room temperature.The nanocomposites were dispersed in carbon tetrachloride and excited using D light at a wavelength of 265 nm. The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction coupled with aromatic alcohol oxidation reactions were carried out in a 70 ml homemade double-jacket quartz glass reactor.0.5 g of catalyst was added to the photo-reactor, and 30 ml of anhydrous acetonitrile (purified by calcium hydroxide and distilled before using) and 1 mmol of aromatic alcohol (purified by distillation before using) was subsequently put into the reactor.After that, the reaction cell was evacuated to a base pressure of 10 kPa for 15 minutes to remove residual oxygen, and afterwards high-purity CO 2 was filled into the reactor for 30 minutes at a flow rate of 15 ml per minute.To ensure the full removal of trace amounts of oxygen, this operation was repeated three times.In order to remove trace amounts of H 2 O and oxygen in the gas, the CO 2 gas was purified through allochroic silica gel, asbestos and activated carbon before importing into the reactor.Then, a balloon was connected to the reactor keeping the reaction under 0.1 MPa pressure.Before irradiation the suspension was kept stirring at 500 rpm for 60 minutes to ensure a CO 2 adsorption and desorption equilibrium.The ultraviolet (UV) light (high pressure mercury lamp main wavelength is 365 nm) was irradiated from the box wall 10 cm in front of the reactor.The liquid products were analyzed using gas chromatography (GC) with a flame ionization detector (FID).In order to analyse the gas products qualitatively, the gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC-MS) (7890A-5975C Agilent Corporation equipped with a HP-5 capillary column (Hewllett-Packard, USA, 30 m 0.25 mm 0.25 mm)) was also used to identify the components of the product.The liquid products were also characterized using a Bruker Avance 400 MHz spectrometer (NMR)."}, {"llm generation": "Ag/TiO 2 nanocomposites", "source": "The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 coupled with selective alcohol oxidation was catalyzed by Ag/TiO 2 nanocomposites under UV light irradiation at room temperature and ambient pressure.", "context": "The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 coupled with selective alcohol oxidation was catalyzed by Ag/TiO 2 nanocomposites under UV light irradiation at room temperature and ambient pressure.CO 2 as the oxidant was reduced to methanol by photo-induced electrons.Aromatic alcohols were used as the reductant to react with photo-generated holes, and converted to aromatic aldehydes with high selectivity.The optimal catalyst was ca. 3 wt Ag/TiO 2 nanoparticles.The maximum conversion of aromatic alcohol to aldehyde was 91.7 with a selectivity of 98, and the highest yield of methanol was 358.7 mol g -1 after irradiation for 48 hours.Our findings may help to design more active photocatalytic systems for the reduction of carbon dioxide and to introduce an environmentally friendly strategy for selective alcohol oxidation based on photocatalysis.

Fig. 1 and S1 present the microscopy images of the TiO 2 and Ag/TiO 2 nanocomposites.From these representative morphologies, it can be clearly seen that the TiO 2 crystallite is well formed and its surface is smooth.Moreover, the SEM and TEM images in Fig. 1 show silver nanoparticles anchored on the surface of the TiO 2 nanoparticles.The silver nanoparticles are homogeneously dispersed on the surface of TiO 2 , forming a series of Ag/TiO 2 nanocomposites. To obtain more information on the catalysts, HR-TEM was used to observe these nanoparticles.Typical TEM micrographs of the TiO 2 and Ag/TiO 2 nanoparticle catalysts are shown in Fig. 1.From Fig. 1b, the relatively dark points are ascribed to Ag nanoparticles.The silver nanoparticle morphology is irregular spherical particles that have a narrow size distribution, while the transparent regions are assigned to TiO 2 in Fig. 1b.Meanwhile, it was evident that the average particle size of the nanoparticles was 40-50 nm, which was in good agreement with the XRD results calculated from the Debye-Scherrer equation (Fig. S2 ).HR-TEM was used to investigate the interfacial structures between Ag and TiO 2 (Fig. 1c andd).In Fig. 1c andd, the lattice fringes of Ag and TiO 2 showed a surface-junction.The (111) lattice fringe of the Ag nanoparticles was 0.236 nm, and the (101) lattice fringe of anatase was 0.356 nm.These results are in agreement with the previous reports. 202122 The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 coupled with selective benzyl alcohol oxidation was carried out under ultraviolet light irradiation at 0.1 MPa CO 2 pressure.The main liquid products were determined using GC (FID detector) (Fig. S3 ).This result was also proved by 1 H NMR spectroscopy (Fig. 2).When the reaction was carried out in CO 2 , the CO 2 was reduced to methanol, and benzaldehyde was the main product of the photocatalytic selective benzyl alcohol oxidation, along with traces of benzoic acid and benzyl ether (Table 1).The highest conversion of benzyl alcohol is 10.3 and 10.7, and the maximum yield of methanol is 21.8 and 20.5 mol g -1 catalyzed by TiO 2 and ca. 1 wt Ag/TiO 2 after reacting for 18 hours, respectively.However, when reacting in an Ar gas atmosphere, the highest conversion of benzyl alcohol is only 1.7 and 1.9, and there is no methanol or other products to be observed when catalyzed by TiO 2 and ca. 3 wt Ag/TiO 2 catalysts, respectively.The blind test without catalyst (please see Table 1, entry 19) shows that the conversion of benzyl alcohol is very low (0.75) and that there is no methanol to be observed.These results verified that CO 2 is able to be reduced to methanol coupled with the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde, and that methanol is only produced from CO 2 , catalyzed by both TiO 2 and Ag/TiO 2 . The effects of the silver loading content on TiO 2 on the catalytic activity were evaluated as well.Compared to pure TiO 2 , the photocatalytic activity of the ca.2-6 wt Ag/TiO 2 nanocomposites exhibited a significant increase (Table 1).Meanwhile, the conversion of benzyl alcohol and the yield of the methanol are both drastically increased when catalyzed by ca.2-6 wt Ag/TiO 2 .It was found that ca. 3 wt Ag/TiO 2 was optimum to achieve the highest conversion of benzyl alcohol (24.6) and the maximum yield of methanol (40.9 mol g -1 ) after reacting for 18 hours.When the silver loading content is less than 3 wt, the photocatalytic efficiency of the catalyst is increased with silver loading content.This could be because the Ag nanoparticles deposited on the surface of TiO 2 can act as photo-induced carrier separation centers. 23Moreover, a Schottky barrier was formed between the silver and TiO 2 contact region, which improved the charge separation and enhanced the photocatalytic activity of TiO 2 (ref.24). However, when the silver loading exceeds 3 wt, the photocatalytic activity rapidly decreases.The conversion of benzyl alcohol and the yield of methanol are decreased from 24.6 to 14.9 and from 40.9 to 14.9 mol g -1 with the increasing of silver loading content from 3 to 9, respectively.This is may be because excess silver nanoparticles cover the surface of the TiO 2 activity sites that can absorb UV photons.Therefore, the absorption photon capacity of the catalyst is reduced.The excess silver nanoparticles can also act as recombination centers of electrons and holes, which also results in a decrease of the photocatalytic activity of the Ag/TiO 2 nanocomposites.In fact, it has been reported that the probability for hole capture increases with the large number of negatively charged silver particles on the surface of TiO 2 at high silver loading, which also increases the photo-induced electron and hole recombinations. 25hese results are in good agreement with the photoluminescence (PL) spectra intensity of the photocatalysts shown in Fig. S4. From Fig. S4, the PL intensities are decreased with an increase of the Ag loading content when the Ag loading content is less than 3 wt.When the PL signal intensity is weaker, the photocatalytic efficiency is higher.However, when the Ag loading content exceeds ca. 4 wt, the PL intensities increase.It is indicated that excess silver deposited on the surface of TiO 2 can act as electron sinks to capture the photo-induced electron and hole pairs.Furthermore, the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 to methanol coupled with the selective oxidation of various alcohols has been performed over 3 wt Ag/TiO 2 under the same reaction conditions.The results are shown in Table 2.It is indicated that all of the catalyzing systems investigated were capable of converting CO 2 to methanol and converting the aromatic alcohols to corresponding aldehydes with different yield.The groups on the aromatic ring have an effect on the reaction performance.The electron donating groups on the aromatic ring favor methanol production and alcohol oxidation.For example, methoxybenzyl alcohol can convert to p-anisaldehyde with conversions of 50.3 and 91.7, and the yield of CH 3 OH is 40.9 and 309.6 mol g -1 after reacting for 18 and 48 hours, respectively.However, the electron withdrawing groups on the aromatic ring result in a low conversion.The conversion of p-nitrobenzaldehyde to nitrobenzyl alcohol is only 8.4 and 19.8 after reacting for 18 and 48 hours, respectively.The yield of CH 3 OH is low as well (13.6 and 79.5 mol g -1 ) under the same reaction conditions. In order to know the stoichiometry of this reaction, the ratio of the formation of methanol and aldehyde has been calculated (the last column in Table 2).The result shows that the ratio will be increased with prolongation of the reaction time.This can be explained by some intermediates that are formed (such as HCOOH, HCHO) in the initial phase.At 48 hours, the highest ratio is 1 : 4 which is still smaller than the reaction stoichiometry (1 : 3).The first reason is that sideproducts are formed, such as H 2 , CH 4 , HCOOH, HCHO etc.The second reason is that with the progression of the reaction, the methanol also reacts with photo-generated holes to produce H 2 and CO 2 .With the increasing concentration of methanol, this reaction becomes faster and faster.When the formation rate of methanol is close to its decomposition rate, the production of methanol levels off. The effect of irradiation time on the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 and benzyl alcohol conversion was investigated over a period of 1-48 hours for the ca. 3 wt Ag/TiO 2 nanocomposite catalyst (Fig. 3).With the increase of irradiation time, the conversion is clearly increased.However, the selectivity is slightly decreased due to by-products emerging in the reaction system.The methanol yield is increased with the extension of irradiation time (Fig. 3b).When the photoirradiation time is less than 18 hours, the increase in yield is low.But when the photoirradiation time is longer than 18 hours, the yield is obviously improving.After the photoirradiation time reaches 45 hours, the yield of methanol is 344.6 mol g -1 (Fig. 3b), and the conversion of benzyl alcohol is 70.6 with a 98 selectivity for benzaldehyde. In order to test the stability of the Ag/TiO 2 nanoparticle catalyst, the used catalysts were recovered by centrifugation and thoroughly washed with anhydrous acetonitrile.The photocatalyst was recycled up to three times.As shown in Fig. 4, its photocatalytic activity was only slightly deteriorated after three consecutive photocatalytic experiments.This can be ascribed to only a few silver nanoparticles leaching and aggregating after the test, leading to the photocatalytic efficiency only weakly decreasing after three run times.These results showed that the photocatalyst was stable after repeated application with a constant conversion of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde.
