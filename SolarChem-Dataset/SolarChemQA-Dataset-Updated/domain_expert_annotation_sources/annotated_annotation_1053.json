FESEM images of Cd 0 . 2 Z 0 .8 S, Ti 3 C 2 and CZSTC, are shown in Fig. 2 (a-d).Fig. 2(a) illustrates that SEM image of Cd 0 . 2 Zn 0 .8 S indicates a large number of nanoparticles with the size of approximately 10-20 nm.Fig. 2(b) shows the layered structure of Ti 3 C 2 , and it can be observed that the loosely stacked nanosheets are prepared by HF etching of Ti 3 AlC 2 , confirming the successful removal of the aluminum in Ti 3 AlC 2 .However, the surface of CZSTC5 (Fig. 2(c) becomes rough and agglomerated.Moreover, some Ti 3 C 2 nanosheets can be observed, which indicates the formation of heterojunction between Cd 0 . 2 Zn 0 .8 S and Ti 3 C 2 .EDX pattern shown in Fig. 2(d) shows the presence of Zn, Cd, S, Ti and C elements in CZSTC5, which further verifies the formation of CZSTC. The microstructures of the as-prepared Cd 0 . 2 Zn 0 .8 S, Ti 3 C 2 and CZSTC5 samples are analyzed by TEM observation.As shown in Fig. 3 results in Fig. 1.The lattice spacing value of Cd 0 . 2 Zn 0 .8 S is measured to be 0.313 nm, as shown in Fig. 3(b), corresponding to the (111) crystal plane of Cd 0 . 2 Zn 0 .8 S 32.TEM image of CZSTC5 in Fig. 3(c) proves the presence of Ti 3 C 2 nanosheets on Cd 0.2 Zn 0.8 S nanospheres, which further confirms the well-combined interface of Cd 0 . 2 Zn 0 .8 S nanospheres and Ti 3 C 2 nanosheets.Furthermore, the HRTEM result of CZSTC5 shown in Fig. 3(d) verifies the formation of CZSTC, as the observed lattice spacing values are 0.313 nm and 0.214 nm, which are corresponding to the Cd 0 . 2 Zn 0 .8 S (111) and Ti 3 C 2 (005) crystal planes, respectively. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is conducted to investigate the chemical states and composition of the Ti 3 C 2 , Cd 0 . 2 Zn 0 .8 S, and CZSTC5.Fig. 4(a) shows the XPS survey spectrum of CZSTC5, which confirm the presence of Cd, Zn, S, Ti and C elements.Fig. 4(b) presents the peaks corresponding to their binding energies at 403.9 eV and 410.7 eV, which correspond to Cd 3d 5/2 and Cd 3d 3/2 , respectively 33.Fig. 4(c) shows two peaks in the Zn 2p domain at binding energies of 1020.7 and 1043.7 eV, which attributed to Zn 2 in ZnS 34,35.Similarly, Fig. 4(d) depicts two peaks at the binding energy 161.1 and 162.2 eV, which are ascribed to the S 2p state 29,36.Also, Fig. 4(e) presents Ti 2p binding energies, which indicates four peaks related to Ti-C (2p 3/2 ), Ti-O (2p 3/2 ), Ti-C (2p 1/2 ), and Ti-O (2p 1/2 ) at the binding energies of 454.3, 457.4,460.2 and 462.9 eV, respectively 37.The high-resolution XPS peaks for C1 s at 280.2, 283.6, 285.2, and 287.8 eV in Fig. 4(f) attributed to characteristics binding energies of C-Ti, C-C, C-O, and C-F, respectively 38,39. The photocatalytic efficiency of the semiconductor strongly depends on its ability to initiate the generation of the efficient electron-hole pair under visible light irradiation.The absorption spectrum in Fig. 5(a) shows the extension in the absorption range of the pure Cd 0 . 2 Zn 0 .8 S and various CZSTC.The absorption band edge of the pure Cd 0 . 2 Zn 0 .8 S is around 500 nm, while the absorption range of CZSTC shifts to the visible light region, which induces the bandgap variation.Fig. 5(a) further indicates that Ti 3 C 2 shows no apparent absorption in the UV region and maximum light-harvesting capability in the visible and infrared area due to its dark nature character 40.With the increasing of Ti 3 C 2 concentration, the absorption band edge shifts to the visible and infrared region, whereas the maximum absorption is obtained from CZSTC with 7 wt Ti 3 C 2 .Moreover, the absorption intensity of the CZSTC decreases with the increasing of the Ti 3 C 2 concentration over 7 wt, which may be explained by the fact that Cd 0.2 Zn 0.8 S scatters away from the light in CZSTC and reduces the light-capturing effect.Therefore, the high amount of Ti 3 C 2 in CZSTC implies the high light-harvesting efficiency 41.The bandgaps of the bare Cd 0 . 2 Zn 0 .8 S, Ti 3 C 2, and various CZSTC, are calculated by Tauc plot as shown in Fig. 5(b); downshift of the bandgap is observed with the smallest bandgap of 2.49 eV for CZS/TC7.Therefore, the low percentage of Ti 3 C 2 in CZSTC is much favorable for their photocatalytic performances. The photocatalytic reduction activities for CZSTC are evaluated for the reduction of CO 2 .Control experiments demonstrate that no considerable decreasing in products is noticed in the absence of either light irradiation or photocatalyst.Fig. 6(a) shows that the bare Cd 0 . 2 Zn 0 .8 S possesses the lowest efficiency for CO 2 reduction, and the observed CO production rate is 0.8 mol h -1 g -1 .However, all CZSTC show the enhanced CO 2 decrease as compared to pristine Cd 0 . 2 Zn 0 .8 S and Ti 3 C 2 , improving that the composite of Ti 3 C 2 with Cd 0 . 2 Zn 0 .8 S successfully increases the photocatalytic efficiency.Among all CZSTC, CZSTC5 shows superior photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity (3.31 mol h -1 g -1 ). Similarly, the production of CH 4 (3.51 mol h -1 g -1 ) resulting from CO 2 reduction by CZSTC is also higher compared to pristine Cd 0 . 2 Zn 0 .8 S, as in Fig. 6(b).The improved photocatalytic efficiency is attributed to the reducing of the bandgap and the effective separation of the photogenerated electron-holes for CZSTC.Photoluminescence (PL) analysis is carried out to investigate the separation efficiency of the photogenerated electron-hole and the interfacial charge transfer for CZSTC.Fig. 7(a) shows the PL spectra of pristine Cd 0.2 Zn 0.8 S, CZSTC, and it can be found that the pristine Cd 0 . 2 Zn 0 .8 S displays the strong emission peak at around 523 nm.However, the PL emission intensity decreases remarkably with the addition of Ti 3 C 2 , which suggests that the photoinduced electron-hole could be efficiently separated when the heterojunction is setup between Cd 0 . 2 Zn 0 .8 S and Ti 3 C 2 .The order of PL emission intensities are listed as: Cd 0.2 Zn 0.8 S CZSTC1CZSTC9CZSTC7 CZSTC3CZSTC5, which is the same as their photocatalytic performance mentioned above. The separation and recombination of charge carriers are closely related to the interfacial charge transfer, which generally affects the photocatalyst's photocatalytic properties.Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is conducted under light irradiation to investigate the resistance behavior of the charge transfer for the various samples, as shown in Fig. 7(b).Naturally, the radius of the semicircular is related to the charge transfer resistance behavior 42,43.It is evident that CZSTC5 displays the smallest semicircular part than those of Cd 0 . 2 Zn 0 .8 S and all other CZSTC due to the excellent conductivity of Ti 3 C 2 , which plays a crucial role in the decreasing of the charge transfer resistance.The current result implies the intense interfacial contact between Cd 0 . 2 Zn 0 .8 S and Ti 3 C 2 in CZSTC, which may benefit from the high charge transfer efficiency. Furthermore, the electrochemical Mott-Schottky (M-S) plots of the as-prepared samples are measured to address further the bandgap structure and energy level of the conduction band (CB).As shown in Fig. 8(a), all the samples display the positive slopes, exhibiting that the as-prepared samples possess typical n-type semiconductor behaviors.The observed flat-band potentials of CZS, CZSTC1, CZSTC3, CZSTC5, CZSTC7 and CZSTC9 are -0.51,-0.55, -0.60, -0.78, -0.68, -0.65 eV versus NHE, respectively.A remarkable negative shift of the flat-band potential is noted for CZSTC5 compared to the other samples, which suggests an efficient separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs and increased reducibility 44,45.As a result, CZSTC5 has the highest CO 2 reduction ability to CO and CH 4 , as proven by Fig. 6. For the ideal photocatalyst, recyclability is one of the vital factors for practical applications.CZSTC5 is chosen to test the long-term stability of the CZSTC nanocomposites for photocatalytic reduction CO 2 under visible light irradiation for four cycles.From Fig. 9(a) and 9(b), it can be observed that no obvious decrease occurs for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to CO and CH 4 .Furthermore, after four cycles, XRD pattern of CZSTC5 is shown in Fig. S1, suggesting that the crystalline structure is almost the same before and after the photocatalytic reaction.Furthermore, EDS mapping of CZS/TC5 after four cycles in Fig. S2 also shows the co-existence of Zn, Cd, S, Ti, and C elements, proving the chemical stability of CZS/TC5 after photocatalytic cycles.From the above results, it is obvious that CZSTC retains high stability during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction. Even though the bare Cd 0 . 2 Zn 0 .8 S is a photocatalytic active material, its photocatalytic efficiency is greatly influenced by the high recombination possibility of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs.The formation of CZSTC is used to solve the above question, and the possible mechanism of the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction is illustrated in Fig. 8(b).When Cd 0.2 Zn 0.8 S and Ti 3 C 2 are photoexcited to generate electron-hole pairs under visible light irradiation, the photogenerated electrons on the LUMO of Cd 0.2 Zn 0.8 S can be directly transferred to the E F of Ti 3 C 2 , as the lower unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) potential of Cd 0.2 Zn 0.8 S (-0.51 eV vs. NHE) is more negative than the Fermi level (E F ) of Ti 3 C 2 (-0.05 eV).Therefore, Ti 3 C 2 works as the electron reservoir, preventing the recombination of photoinduced electron-hole pairs and enlarging the lifetime of photoinduced charge carriers.Moreover, CZSTC possesses many exposed active sites, as shown in Fig. S3 and Table S1, which might favor for the photocatalytic activity of CO 2 reduction.The photocatalytic activity of CO 2 reduction in this work is compared with those in the reported literatures, as shown in Table S2, which shows the potential of the as-prepared Cd 0 . 2 Zn 0 .8 STi 3 C 2 nanocomposites as the effective catalyst in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction."}, {"llm generation": "Cd 0.2 Zn 0.8 STi 3 C 2 nanocomposites", "source": "In brief, with an easy three-stage solvothermal method, we have synthesized highly active Cd 0.2 Zn 0.8 STi 3 C 2 nanocomposites successfully, which show significantly increased performance of the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction under visible light irradiation.", "context": "In brief, with an easy three-stage solvothermal method, we have synthesized highly active Cd 0.2 Zn 0.8 STi 3 C 2 nanocomposites successfully, which show significantly increased performance of the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction under visible light irradiation.The optimal loading of Ti 3 C 2 contents is 5 wt, and the corresponding photocatalytic reduction values of CO 2 to CH 4 and CO are 3.51 mol h -1 g -1 and 3.31 mol h -1 g -1 , respectively.The notable photocatalytic improvement can be attributed to the efficient electron-hole separation and charge transfer on the interface between Cd 0 . 2 Zn 0 .8 S and Ti 3 C 2 .The LUMO potential of Cd 0 . 2 Zn 0 .8 S (-0.51 eV vs. NHE) is more negative than the Fermi level (E f ) of Ti 3 C 2 (-0.05 eV), this large difference induces Ti 3 C 2 to act as the electron reservoir, which further prevents electronhole recombination.Furthermore, CZSTC exhibits excellent recyclability under visible-light irradiation.

Cd 0 . 2 Zn 0 .8 STi 3 C 2 nanocomposites with the various contents of Ti 3 C 2 (1 wt, 3 wt, 5 wt, 7 wt and 9 wt ) were labeled as CZSTC1, CZSTC3, CZSTC5, CZSTC7 and CZSTC9, respectively.Same procedure of the first step was adopted to synthesize pure Cd 0 . 2 Zn 0 .8 S in the absence of Ti 3 C 2 . X-rays diffraction of the samples was analyzed by Rigaku Powder Xray diffractometer with Cu-K radiation ( 1.5418A).Morphology and microstructure of the samples were analyzed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, JEOL, JSM-7800 F, Japan) and transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEOL, JEM-2100, Japan), respectively.UV-vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, UV-2550, Japan) was applied to get diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of the samples.Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) (ASAP2460, Micromeritics, USA) test was used to find out the surface area of the samples.Composition and Chemical states of the samples were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Quantum 2000, PHI, Eden Prairie, MN, USA).The photo-generated charge carrier separation analysis was measured by photoluminescence (PL, Hitachi F-4600, Japan) spectra, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS, PGSTAT100, Netherlands) and Electrochemical Mott-Schottky (M-S) plots. The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction analysis was conducted in a gaseous state for photocatalytic efficiency of Cd 0 . 2 Zn 0 .8 STi 3 C 2 nanocomposites.In a standard experimental procedure, 30 mg of the asprepared photocatalyst was dispersed in 50 mL of deionized water.Before light irradiation, the distributed catalyst solution was exposed to vacuum treatment.To remove the air contamination, N 2 was passed through suspension.Then highly pure CO 2 (99.999) was subjected into the vessel for 30 min to achieve the adsorption-desorption balance.A 300 W xenon light source (PLS-SXE300C, Beijing Perfect light Co. Ltd., China) was kept 5 cm above the reactor with a UV cut-off filter ( 320 nm).A gas chromatograph (EWAI-GC-4000A) with TCD and FID detectors connected to the quartz reactor was used to analyze CO and CH 4 .After light irradiation, 100 L of the resultant gas was taken out and detected by a TCD reactor."}], "reactor type": [], "operation mode": []}}
