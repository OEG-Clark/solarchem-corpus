Field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) were used to observe the morphologies (Fig. 2).Pristine ZnO nanofibers are very smooth and uniform in size (Fig. 2a).Comparatively, after loading ZnMn 2 O 4 , numerous nanothorns protruded (Fig. 2b).After magnification, Fig. 2c clearly revealed the existence of ZnMn 2 O 4 nanothorns and confirmed that ZnMn 2 O 4 was grown out of the surface of ZnO.The tight contact between them is beneficial for charge transfer and the corresponding construction of internal electric field.The measured lattice spacing d of 0.264 and 0.251 nm in high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images was attributed to (0 0 2) and (1 0 1) facets of ZnO, respectively.Besides, the rest two (0.285 and 0.255 nm) could be classified as (2 0 0) and (2 1 1) facets of ZnMn 2 O 4 , respectively (Fig. 2d).A typical energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy mapping (EDX-mapping) image of the composite (Fig. 2e) agreed well with the XRD results. The optical absorption properties were measured by UV-visible diffuse reflection absorption spectra (UV-vis DRS) (Fig. 3).ZnO nanofibers mainly absorbed UV light below 400 nm; while ZnMn 2 O 4 had strong absorption toward visible light.This is explained by their distinctive E g .On one hand, the light absorption of the composite was better than their unitary counterpart alone.On the other hand, overloading ZnMn 2 O 4 would densify nanothorns and reduced the multiple reflections of light 56.Worth still, excessive ZnMn 2 O 4 would cover the available surface of ZnO.It is similar to the reasonable dense planting.Besides, the excitation light source of ZnMn 2 O 4 /ZnO nanofibers was UVlight 57.It can be concluded that a proper loading of ZnMn 2 O 4 can greatly improve the light utilization rate of composite nanofibers. N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms were investigated according to BJH method (Fig. 4a).The isotherms of Z, ZZM5, ZZM30 and ZZM50 could be classified as type IV isotherm with H3 type hysteresis.The relative pore size distribution (PSD) curves (the inset of Fig. 4a) confirmed that small pores around 3.5 nm existed in ZnO nanofibers, which were formed by piling up of ZnO nanoparticles.Instead of nanopores, ZnMn 2 O 4 /ZnO nanofibers possessed more mesopores around 30 nm.This could be ascribed to the tiny slits accumulated by ZnMn 2 O 4 nanothorns.Table 1 compared surface area (S BET ), pore volume (V p ) and average pore size (d p ) of these samples.The greater the loading of ZnMn 2 O 4 , the greater the S BET was.For average pore size, ZZM30 possessed the biggest d p .This could be accredited to the fact that the number of mesopores between ZnO nanoparticles would decrease as the increase of the tiny slits between ZnMn 2 O 4 nanothorns.A proper density of nanothorns was beneficial to achieve the largest d p , which was consistent with the discussion of UV-vis DRS. CO 2 adsorption isotherms (Fig. 4b) were recorded to distinguish the CO 2 adsorption capacity because it could affect the pathway and kinetics of reactions.The CO 2 adsorption capacity gradually reached the maximum as the pressure approached atmospheric pressure.The CO 2 adsorption performance of ZZM30 exceeded that of Z under the same XPS was performed to obtain the surface chemical states of samples.The survey spectra of ZM and ZZM30 (Fig. 5a) affirmed the existence of Zn, Mn and O elements; while that of Z verified that it contained Zn and O elements.The signal of Mn 2p was stronger than that of Zn 2p in sample ZM; while the signal of Zn 2p was more obvious than that of Mn 2p in sample ZZM30.It is consistent with the ratio of Zn and Mn in them.Besides, Na 1 s peaks came from the residual Na in the sample ZM.The absence of Na 1 s in the survey spectra of ZZM30 and Z also proved that this peak belonged to the residual Na during the synthesis of ZnMn 2 O 4 . Two distinct peaks appeared at 1023 (Zn 2p 3/2 ) and 1046 (Zn 2p 1/2 ) eV in the Zn 2p XPS spectra (Fig. 5b), demonstrating that the valence state of Zn was 2 in Z, ZM and ZZM30.The binding energy of Zn 2p in ZZM30 shifted slightly and became lower than that in Z, which proved that the ZnMn 2 O 4 would lose electrons and the ZnO would get electrons after close contact.In Fig. 5c, only one chemical states of Mn (Mn 3 ) could be observed, and it indicated the generation of ZnMn 2 O 4 .In addition, two peaks at 643.4 and 655.4 eV could be differentiated into Mn 3 2p 3/2 and Mn 3 2p 1/2 , respectively 58,59.For O 1 s XPS spectra (Fig. 5d), two peaks at 530 and 532 eV matched with the crystal lattice (O L ) and the surface chemisorbed oxygen (O C ) in Z, ZM and ZZM30, respectively 60,61.O C and OH are vital active species for ZnO-based photocatalysts 62.The more O C means that more attracted oxygen species or OH.The percentages of the O C in Z, ZZM30 and ZM (in the Supporting Information Table S2) were 51, 53 and 54, respectively.ZM possessed more O C than Z or ZZM30, which coincided with its best CO 2 adsorption performance.The ratios of different elements in ZZM30 were listed in Table S2, deriving from the XPS study.between ZnO and ZnMn 2 O 4 was obviously enhanced.Besides, linear sweep voltammetry curves (LSV) were also performed to evaluate the reduction capability of Z and ZZM30 (Fig. 6b).The over potential required by ZZM30 (385 mA) was much smaller than that of Z (578 mA) to achieve the same current density of 1 mA cm -2 , indicating that charge transport was easier in composite samples.In a word, the enhancement of the charge transport at the two-phase interface could greatly improve the migration rate of photogenerated e CB -and h VB . Fluorescence spectra (Fig. 7a) were collected to reveal the separation efficiency of photogenerated e CB and h VB in the composite.The PL spectra of all samples were basically similar and there were five characteristic peaks residing at 385, 449, 468, 485 and 550 nm.The characteristic peak at 385 nm was caused by the band edge absorption of ZnO.The recombination of electrons and oxygen vacancies easily generated excitons, thus exciton energy levels near the bottom of the conduction band would form.Peaks at 449 and 468 nm might spring from this.Due to the zinc/oxygen vacancies in the material, the characteristic absorption would occur at the wavelength of 485 and 550 nm, respectively.ZnMn 2 O 4 /ZnO had lower fluorescence intensity than ZnO nanofibers, corroborating that the deposition of ZnMn 2 O 4 greatly suppressed the recombination of photogenerated e CB -and h VB .ZZM30 had the lowest fluorescence intensity, corresponding to the best photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance.These results proved that ZnMn 2 O 4 could improve the separation efficiency of charge carriers.Time-resolved PL was also conducted to explore the decay kinetics and lifetime of carriers.Fig. 7b shows the PL decay curves of Z and ZZM30.We fitted the curves with double exponential and calculated the average fluorescence lifetime ( Average ) 63.The results are shown in Table 2.The process of fluorescence attenuation mainly took place in Based on the formula proposed by Tauc et al. 64, the UV-vis DRS spectra of ZnO and ZnMn 2 O 4 were fitted according to the Kubelka-Munk function.The results are shown in Fig. 8a.We have calculated the E g of ZnO and ZnMn 2 O 4 based on the formula listed in SI.The results were 3.15 and 1.98 eV, respectively.The valence/conduction band (VB/CB) positions were investigated by the Mott-Schottky curve (Fig. 8b).The plot slope of ZnMn 2 O 4 was negative, indicating that it was a typical ptype photocatalyst.In view of the flat-band potential (E fb ) of the p-type semiconductor was approximately equal to its VB, we could estimate the VB position of ZnMn 2 O 4 was 0.51 V versus NHE 65,66.Considering that the E g of ZnMn 2 O 4 was 1.98 eV, we could calculate the position of the CB was -1.47 eV.Similarly, we could conclude that ZnO showed ntype characteristics with a CB of -0.57eV.In summary, we could conclude that the composite was successfully constructed after the introduction of ZnMn 2 O 4 .XPS valence band spectra (Fig. 8c) were further measured to estimate the CB and VB positions of ZnO and ZnMn 2 O 4 .We could conclude that the VB positions of ZnO and ZnMn 2 O 4 were 0.51 and 2.58 eV, respectively.It was consistent with the Tauc plot method and Mott-Schottky measurement.In summary, we can obtain the band structure diagrams of ZnO and ZnMn 2 O 4 , as illustrated in Fig. 8d. of a semiconductor is the electrostatic potential between Vacuum level (E Vac ) and the Fermi level (E F ).As shown in Fig. 9, we calculated the of ZnO and ZnMn 2 O 4 by means of DFT calculation method 67. of ZnO (0 0 1) plane was 4.63 eV, which was larger than that of ZnMn 2 O 4 (0 0 1) plane (4.55 eV).In contrast, the Fermi level of ZnMn 2 O 4 was greater than that of ZnO.When they came into contact, e CB -will spontaneously transfer from photocatalyst with higher E F (ZnMn 2 O 4 ) to photocatalyst with lower E F (ZnO) until their Fermi levels were equal. Theoretically, this inferred that e CB -would migrate from p-type photocatalyst to n-type photocatalyst in ZnMn 2 O 4 /ZnO, which had never been reported before.In the previous XPS analysis (Fig. 5b), the binding energy reduction of Zn 2p for the composite compared with ZnO also confirmed the abnormal electron transfer.The transfer of photogenerated e CB -would cause the band of ZnO or ZnMn 2 O 4 to bend down or up, respectively.At last, an internal electric field directing from ZnMn 2 O 4 to ZnO is formed. To begin with, we can acknowledge that the VB of ZnMn 2 O was close to the CB of ZnO but far away from the VB of ZnO from the band structure of Z and ZM (Fig. 8d).In other words, the recombination of h VB Photocatalytic performance under 300 W Xe arc lamp (UV-visible light) were investigated (Fig. 10a).Z and ZM exhibited very poor activity due to the rapid recombination of photogenerated e CB -and h VB .CO was the main reduction product and O 2 was the oxidation product.The trace amount of CH 4 could be ascribed to more electrons and complex decarboxylation/hydrogenation processes were required.In addition, production rates of CO and CH 4 were greatly improved in the composite compared to those in pristine ZnO nanofibers and ZnMn 2 O 4 .There are four reasons: (i) the hierarchical structure can realize multiple reflections of light, (ii) the good conductivity of ZnMn 2 O 4 can reduce the electron transfer resistance at the two-phase interface and enhance the electron transfer between ZnO and ZnMn 2 O 4 , (iii) the nanothorn structure can provide abundant active edges and serve as the adsorption, activation and reaction sites for CO 2 molecules, (iv) the S-scheme charge transfer can effectively suppress carrier recombination as well as preserve strong redox abilities of photogenerated e CB -and h VB . Fig. 10b illustrates the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction cycle curves of sample ZZM30.The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction cycle performance was tested every 1 h with a cycle of 3 h.The output of CO and CH 4 could still maintain 89 and 90 after a 24 h cycle, respectively, indicating the stability of the composite. The photocatalytic mechanism of ZnMn 2 O 4 /ZnO is presented in Fig. 11.Before contact, the smaller of ZnMn 2 O 4 (4.55 eV) than that of ZnO (4.63 eV) is witnessed (Fig. 11a).When they came into close contact, the e CB -in ZnMn 2 O 4 would flow to ZnO until their Fermi levels were the same (Fig. 11b).68.Therefore, ZnMn 2 O 4 lost electrons and was positively charged; while ZnO acquired electrons and formed an electron-rich layer 69.An internal electric field pointing from ZnMn 2 O 4 to ZnO would naturally form at the interface due to the enrichment and depletion of charges on the two photocatalysts, preventing the further transfer of electrons from ZnMn 2 O 4 to ZnO 70.At As a result, S-scheme heterojunction mechanism optimized the transfer path of electrons and holes, endowing ZnMn 2 O 4 /ZnO composite nanofibers with higher oxidation and reduction capabilities."}], "co-catalyst": [], "light source": [], "lamp": [], "reaction medium": [], "reactor type": [], "operation mode": []}}
