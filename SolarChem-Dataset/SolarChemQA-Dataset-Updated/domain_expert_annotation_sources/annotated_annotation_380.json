The copper-impregnated sample ( IM 3.0Cu/TiO 2 ) was prepared by an incipient wetness method.A solution of CuNO 3 2 21/2H 2 O (57.0 mg) in water (1.1 mL) was slowly added to ground Aeroxide P25 TiO 2 (519 mg) to obtain a homogeneous slurry, which was dried in a dessicator (ca. 10 mbar) at room temperature for 1 h.The resulting pale blue powder was calcined at increasing temperatures (up to 150 C at 3 C min -1 , then maintained for 2 h, and finally up to 500 C at 5 C min -1 and held at that temperature for 0.5 h).After cooling down to room temperature and grinding on a mortar, IM 3.0Cu/TiO 2 was obtained as a green-grey solid. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed by means of a PANalytical Cubix'Pro diffractometer equipped with an X'Celerator detector and automatic divergence and reception slits using Cu-K radiation (0.154056 nm).The mean size of the ordered (crystalline) domains (d) was estimated using the Scherrer equation.The equation can be written as d 0.9 cos A , where is the X-ray wavelength, is the line broadening at half the maximum intensity (FWHM), after subtracting the instrumental line broadening, in radians, and A is the Bragg angle.Raman spectra were recorded with a spectral window of 1000-100 cm -1 on a Jasco NRS-3100 laser Raman spectrophotometer ( exc 785 nm).Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms were collected on a Micromeritics Gemini V gas adsorption analyzer at 77 K, after degassing the samples at 423 K overnight in a Micromeritics Flow prep 060 system with nitrogen flux gas.The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas were calculated from the adsorption branch of the isotherm according to the BJH method.Diffuse reflectance UV-vis (DRUV-vis) absorption spectra were carried out on a CARY 500 SCAN VARIAN spectrophotometer in the 300-800 nm range.Scanning electron micrographs of the samples were taken with a field emission gun scanning electron microscope (FEG-SEM) model JEOL 7001F, equipped with a spectrometer of energy dispersion of X-ray (EDX) from Oxford instruments by using the following operational parameters: acceleration voltage 20 kV, measuring time 100 s, working distance 25 mm, counting rate 1.2 kcps.Characterisation by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) was carried out in a Jem-2100 LaB 6 (Jeol) microscope, at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV, coupled with an Inca Energy TEM 200 (Oxford) energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy and a highangle annular dark field (HAADF) detector.Samples were deposited on carbon-coated nickel grids, in order to avoid interference effects associated with copper analogues.Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed using a Mettler Toledo TGA/SDATA851e thermo-balance under air from room temperature to 800 C. Xray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data were collected on a SPECS spectrometer equipped with a 150-MCD-9 detector and using a non-monochromatic Al K (1486.6 eV) X-ray source.Spectra were recorded at 175 C, using an analyzer pass energy of 30 eV, an X-ray power of 50 W and under an operating pressure of 10 -9 mbar.During data processing of the XPS spectra, binding energy (BE) values were referenced to the C1s signal (284.6 eV).Spectra treatment has been performed using the CASA software. In a typical experiment, the photocatalyst powder (25 mg) was suspended in water (25 mL) by sonication for 15 min.For some experiments, a certain amount (generally, 13 mM) of a sacrificial electron donor (e.g.Na 2 S) was dissolved in the aqueous liquid.The resulting suspension was then transferred to a cylindrical quartz reactor (diameter 44 mm, volume 50 mL, equipped with a gas inlet valve, a gas outlet valve and a pressure gauge) and purged with the desired gas (generally CO 2 , 5 mL min -1 for 15 min, and then pressurised-depressurised to 1.4 bar for five cycles); the reactor was finally loaded with the desired gas (1.4 bar) and tightly closed.The suspension was stirred (500 min -1 ) and irradiated with a medium pressure Hg lamp (125 W, irradiance 1.5 kW m -2 ) for 15 h; the reactor vessel was kept in a water bath at ca. 25 C throughout the experiment.After the light had been switched off, the reaction mixtures were stirred until the pressure reading had stabilised.Two different gaseous samples were taken: (g1) a 2.5 cm 3 sample which was injected on a two-channel chromatograph (Agilent 490 Micro GC, carrier gas: Ar) equipped with thermal conductivity detectors (TCD), and a MolSieve 5 A column (first channel) for the quantification of H 2 and CO, and a PoraPLOT Q column (second channel) for the quantification of CO 2 and CH 4 ; and (g2) a 50 cm 3 sample, which was then taken by collecting the entire amount of headspace gas in the reactor and further flushing with more CO 2 and injected on a three-channel chromatographic system (Varian 450-GC Rapid Refinery Gas Analyser) equipped with one TCD for the quantification of H 2 (first channel), one TCD for the quantification of CO 2 and CO (second channel), and one flame ionisation detector (FID) for the quantification of CH 4 (third channel), using Ar (first channel) and He (second and third channels) as the carrier gases.The amounts of H 2 , CH 4 and CO were averaged over the figures obtained by analyses of both gaseous samples (g1 and g2), which agreed within a standard deviation of ca.4.Moreover, two different liquid samples, obtained from centrifuged and decanted aliquots of the final suspension, were analysed as follows: (l1) a ca.0.5 g sample was diluted with ultrapure water (ca.4.5 g), acidified by addition of a 1.4 M aqueous H 2 SO 4 solution (ca.0.015 g), and analysed by liquid chromatography on a Coregel 87H column (Waters 1525 Binary HPLC Pump, injection volume 10 L, column temperature 70 C, eluent: 4 mM aqueous H 2 SO 4 , flow rate 0.7 mL min -1 ) and a refractive index detector (Waters 2410) for the quantification of formic acid; and (l2) a liquid sample was injected without any further treatment (actual injection volume 1 L) on a gas chromatograph (Agilent Technologies 7890A GC System) equipped with a DB-wax column (carrier gas: He, flow rate 1 mL min -1 ) and a FID, aiming at the detection of methanol.In some cases, the liquid phases of the final reaction mixtures (after separation of the catalyst) were analysed by 13 C NMR spectroscopy (75.48 MHz, 25 C, 2056 scans) on a Bruker Avance-300 spectrometer, using dimethyl sulfoxide-d 6 (dmso-d 6 ) inside a co-axial capillary tube as the reference solvent. At the end of the photocatalytic reactions performed in the presence of Na 2 S, an off-white solid floating on the liquid was observed.After allowing the suspensions to settle, the solid remained on top and could be separated by skimming.For a quantitative analysis of such solid, an extraction was performed.In a typical separation, the final suspension from the reaction catalysed by 2.0Cu-TiO 2 was mixed with tetrachloroethylene (10 mL) and the resulting colourless bottom phase further washed using the same solvent (3 2 mL).The combined organic extracts were dried by mixing with anhydrous magnesium sulfate and subsequent separation by filtration.The solvent was removed under reduced pressure on a rotary evaporator, yielding a pale yellow solid (4.0 mg; corresponding mainly to elemental sulfur according to elemental analysis; 0.12 mmol)."}, {"llm generation": "Mercury", "source": "Reaction conditions: Stirred suspensions of the photocatalyst (25 mg) in water (25 mL) in the presence of the specified amounts of sacrificial electron donor (solute) were irradiated with a Hg lamp (125 W) under a CO2 atmosphere (1.4 bar) at 25 C for 15 h; hyphens denote figures lower than the corresponding detection limits.", "context": "The synthesis of nanoparticulate copper-doped titania photocatalysts can be achieved by a solvo-thermal method using ethanol as the solvent.The addition of small amounts of water induced the controlled hydrolysis-condensation of titanium isopropoxide in the presence of Cu 2 , thus, giving rise to Cu-TiO 2 solids composed of small anatase crystallites (12-15 nm in diameter).Copper is incorporated the bulk of the crystalline titania matrix, thus, resulting in the substitution of Ti(IV) atoms with Cu(II), with certain expansion of the anatase lattice, as evidenced by a shift in the X-ray diffraction angles of its (1 0 1) planes.The band gaps of the materials experience a slight but steady decrease with increasing Cu content, a phenomenon which confirms its homogeneous distribution throughout the structure.The effect of copper doping on the photocatalytic activity of these Cu-TiO 2 materials in the UV-induced reduction of CO 2 has been studied.Based on thorough analyses of reaction products and their yields, we have shown that copperdoped titania has the potential to enhance the formation of formic acid and CO, in the presence of sulfide as an electron donor.In addition, concomitant and significant production of H 2 (in excess of 300 mol g cat -1 h -1 ) could be achieved.Short reaction times favour the reduction of CO 2 , whereas increasing irradiation times leads to preferential H 2 formation.Given the simultaneous reduction of H 2 O and CO 2 and the consumption of sulfide, a highly undesirable and toxic pollutant, this finding is promising for combining fuel generation and environmental remediation in a clean and efficient light-activated process.

At the end of the photocatalytic reactions performed in the presence of Na 2 S, an off-white solid floating on the liquid was observed.After allowing the suspensions to settle, the solid remained on top and could be separated by skimming.For a quantitative analysis of such solid, an extraction was performed.In a typical separation, the final suspension from the reaction catalysed by 2.0Cu-TiO 2 was mixed with tetrachloroethylene (10 mL) and the resulting colourless bottom phase further washed using the same solvent (3 2 mL).The combined organic extracts were dried by mixing with anhydrous magnesium sulfate and subsequent separation by filtration.The solvent was removed under reduced pressure on a rotary evaporator, yielding a pale yellow solid (4.0 mg; corresponding mainly to elemental sulfur according to elemental analysis; 0.12 mmol)."}, {"llm generation": "Liquid", "source": "Reaction conditions: Stirred suspensions of the photocatalyst (25 mg) in water (25 mL) in the presence of the specified amounts of sacrificial electron donor (solute) were irradiated with a Hg lamp (125 W) under a CO2 atmosphere (1.4 bar) at 25 C for 15 h; hyphens denote figures lower than the corresponding detection limits.", "context": "The synthesis of nanoparticulate copper-doped titania photocatalysts can be achieved by a solvo-thermal method using ethanol as the solvent.The addition of small amounts of water induced the controlled hydrolysis-condensation of titanium isopropoxide in the presence of Cu 2 , thus, giving rise to Cu-TiO 2 solids composed of small anatase crystallites (12-15 nm in diameter).Copper is incorporated the bulk of the crystalline titania matrix, thus, resulting in the substitution of Ti(IV) atoms with Cu(II), with certain expansion of the anatase lattice, as evidenced by a shift in the X-ray diffraction angles of its (1 0 1) planes.The band gaps of the materials experience a slight but steady decrease with increasing Cu content, a phenomenon which confirms its homogeneous distribution throughout the structure.The effect of copper doping on the photocatalytic activity of these Cu-TiO 2 materials in the UV-induced reduction of CO 2 has been studied.Based on thorough analyses of reaction products and their yields, we have shown that copperdoped titania has the potential to enhance the formation of formic acid and CO, in the presence of sulfide as an electron donor.In addition, concomitant and significant production of H 2 (in excess of 300 mol g cat -1 h -1 ) could be achieved.Short reaction times favour the reduction of CO 2 , whereas increasing irradiation times leads to preferential H 2 formation.Given the simultaneous reduction of H 2 O and CO 2 and the consumption of sulfide, a highly undesirable and toxic pollutant, this finding is promising for combining fuel generation and environmental remediation in a clean and efficient light-activated process.
