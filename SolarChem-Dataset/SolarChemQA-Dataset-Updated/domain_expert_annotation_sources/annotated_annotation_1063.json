Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) spectra were recorded with a Thermo Nicolet 5700 using KBr pellets for the sample.X-ray powder diffraction patterns of the samples were recorded on a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer with Cu Ka (l 14 1.5418 A) radiation in the range of 5-70 .The morphology analysis of the synthesized samples was collected on a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Sirion 200) at an acceleration voltage of 10 kV.X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out on a scanning X-ray microprobe (K-Alpha, Thermo Scientic) with Al a radiation and the C 1s peak at 284.8 eV as the internal standard.The UV-Vis absorption spectrum was obtained on a UV-2550 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan).The CO 2 adsorption/desorption measurements were conducted under the ambient condition of 298 K (ASAP 2020).Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms were measured at 298 K on an ASAP 2460 instrument.Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) on a JEM-200CX apparatus was performed at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. 2.2.1 Synthesis of TiO 2 .Titanium tetraisopropanolate (400 mL) was added to the mortar, and grinded for 30 min.Then, the obtained powder was transferred to a 25 mL Teon-sealed autoclave and heated at 120 C for 12 hours. 2.2.2 Synthesis of ZIF-8.2-Methyl imidazole (0.071 g) and zinc acetate dehydrate (0.071 g) were added to the mortar, and evenly mixed.Then, the mixture was grinded for 30 min, and transferred to a 25 mL Teon-sealed autoclave and heated at 120 C for 12 hours. 2.2.3 Synthesis of TiO 2 /ZIF-8-GX.2-Methyl imidazole (0.071 g) and zinc acetate dehydrate (0.071 g) were added to the mortar, and evenly mixed.Then, ethanol (200 mL) and a certain amount of titanium tetraisopropanolate (200, 300, 400 mL) were put into this mortar, and grinded for 30 min.Finally, the obtained mixture was transferred to a 25 mL Teon-sealed autoclave and heated at 120 C for 12 hours.The resulting samples were dened as TiO 2 /ZIF-8-GX (X 14 1, 2, and 3, respectively, corresponding to 200, 300 and 400 mL titanium tetraisopropanolate). 2.2.4 Synthesis of TiO 2 /ZIF-8-SX.The synthetic process was modied according to the reported literature. 502-Methyl imidazole (0.71 g) and zinc acetate dehydrate (0.71 g) were added to a 25 mL Teon-sealed autoclave, and evenly mixed.Then, titanium tetraisopropanolate (2, 3, 4 mL) was added, and the obtained mixture was transferred to a 25 mL Teon-sealed autoclave and heated at 180 C for 24 hours.Finally, the resulting powders were hydrolysed in the presence of water with pH 14 11.The obtained samples were dened as TiO 2 /ZIF-8-SX (X 14 1, 2, and 3 respectively, corresponding to 2, 3, and 4 mL titanium tetraisopropanolate). 2.3.1 Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.The photocatalyst (1 mg) was dispersed in 1 mL ethanol, and then coated on 1 cm A 3 cm ITO glass.The cover range is 1 cm A 3 cm.The prepared samples were placed in a self-made photocatalytic reactor, and 150 mL distilled water was added at the bottom as the reducing agent.CO 2 was introduced into the reactor to replace the air and ensured that the reactor was full of CO 2 .A LED lamp was used as the light source.Aer irradiation for 2 hours, 0.5 mL and 1.0 mL gas were taken and placed in a gas chromatography (GC 1120) instrument to determine the content of CO and H 2 . 2.3.2CO 2 photoreduction analysis.The electrochemical analyzer (CHI 760E) was used for the photoelectrochemical test and Mott-Schottky test with the standard three-electrode system.A sodium sulfate solution (0.2 mol L A1 ) served as the electrolyte.The sample (1 mg) and 5 Naon solution were added to 2 mL ethanol and mixed for 1 h, and then evenly dropped on a 1 cm A 2 cm ITO conductive glass as the working electrode.The reference electrode was the Ag/AgCl electrode, and the counter electrode was the platinum electrode. The experimental condition is similar to that of the CO 2 photoreduction.The difference exists in that TiO 2 /ZIF-8-G2 is uniformly mixed with terephthalic acid (TA) (mass ratio 14 5 : 1).The photogenerated OHc would react with TA to generate 2-hydroxyterephthalic acid (TAOH), which could be used to detect the generated OHc.Aer irradiation, the obtained sample is used for uorescence measurements."}, {"llm generation": "TiO2/ZIF-8 composite photocatalysts", "source": "One family of TiO 2 /ZIF-8 composite photocatalysts has been prepared by the grinding method using an in situ synthetic process (experiment details in Experimental section), and is dened as TiO 2 /ZIF-8-GX (X 14 1, 2 and 3, corresponding to the different volumes of used Ti(OiPr) 4 ).", "context": "One family of TiO 2 /ZIF-8 composite photocatalysts has been prepared by the grinding method using an in situ synthetic process (experiment details in Experimental section), and is dened as TiO 2 /ZIF-8-GX (X 14 1, 2 and 3, corresponding to the different volumes of used Ti(OiPr) 4 ).For comparison, another family of TiO 2 /ZIF-8 composite photocatalysts was also prepared using the same reaction substrates with the help of the solid-synthesis method, namely ZIF-8/TiO 2 -SX (X 14 1, 2 and 3, corresponding to the different volumes of used Ti(OiPr) 4 ).In order to conrm the successful formation of ZIF-8 and TiO 2 , all as-synthesized powders have been identied via the powder Xray diffraction (PXRD) patterns.The crystallinities of TiO 2 /ZIF-8-GX are not well-dened.Only several weak peaks (around 10.4 , 12.5 and 18.5 ) are observed, which are consistent with the simulated PXRD pattern of ZIF-8 (Fig. 1a and S3 ).In addition, there is a broad peak between 20 and 40 relative to TiO 2 , which can be attributed to the anatase TiO 2 (JCPDS no.21-1272). 51Additionally, the PXRD patterns of TiO 2 /ZIF-8-SX were performed.Their patterns exhibit good diffraction peaks, and match well with that of ZIF-8, implying that the good crystallinity of ZIF-8 is well maintained (Fig. S2 ).It should be mentioned that a weak diffraction peak at 25.7 is responsible for the (101) plane of TiO 2 . In addition, the Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were used to analyze the surface chemistry of the prepared TiO 2 / ZIF-8 composite photocatalysts.As shown in Fig. 1b .Besides, the peak at 420 cm A1 in the spectra belongs to the stretching vibrations of the Zn-N bonds. 52,53Additionally, the broad peaks from 500 to 800 cm A1 are ascribed to the stretching vibrations of the Ti-O bonds. 54,55As shown in Fig. S1 2a).The XPS spectrum of Ti exhibits two peaks at 458.6 eV and 464.3 eV, which are relative to the binding energies of Ti 2p 3/2 and Ti 2p 1/2 , respectively (Fig. 2b).This implies the existence of the oxidation state Ti 4 in TiO 2 /ZIF-8-G2.As seen in Fig. 2c, the binding energies at 1022.1 eV and 1045.1 eV belong to the Zn 2p 3/2 and Zn 2p 1/2 , respectively.Fig. 2d shows that two peaks at around 284.7 eV and 288.5 eV are assigned to the C-C and C-N bonds from the imidazole groups in the C 1s spectrum, respectively.Additionally, in the spectrum of N, two peaks (399.3 and 400.9 eV) can be attributed to -NHand C-N, respectively (Fig. 2e).In the O 1s spectrum, one main peak at 530.3 eV belongs to the Ti-O bonds, and the other peak with weak intensity at 531.6 eV is attributed to the lattice oxygen atoms in TiO 2 (Fig. 2f). 56,57In summary, all characterization results indicate that the successful combination of TiO 2 and ZIF-8 has been realized. The obtained photocatalysts have been used to evaluate their surface morphology with the help of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images.The morphologies of ZIF-8, TiO 2 and TiO 2 /ZIF-8-GX are found to be different by SEM images.The SEM images show that the particles of ZIF-8 possess the smooth surface and exhibit angular shapes (Fig. 3a andb).Fig. 3b shows that the as-synthesized TiO 2 particles are spherical with rough surfaces.In addition, the pure TiO 2 spheres can agglomerate together.As shown in Fig. 3c-e, most of the particles also maintain the sphere shape, but possess rougher surfaces, compared with that of the pure TiO 2 spheres, indicating that the ZIF-8 particles have successfully coated the surfaces of the TiO 2 spheres.The coating of ZIF-8 make TiO 2 /ZIF-8-GX greatly avoid the agglomeration of TiO 2 , which may enhance their catalytic activity.The elemental distribution of TiO 2 /ZIF-8-GX has been carried out with the help of element mapping.Fig. 3f clearly displays the element distribution of TiO 2 /ZIF-8-G2, where the cyan, red, grey, green and yellow colours represent the distributions of each element C, N, O, Ti and Zn, respectively.With the help of the element mapping, we can conrm that ZIF-8 was successfully located on the surface of the TiO 2 spheres.Summarily, in TiO 2 /ZIF-8-GX, ZIF-8 is located at the surface of the TiO 2 spheres.In order to justify our hypothesis, taking TiO 2 / ZIF-8-G2 as an example, transmission electron microscope (TEM) images have been used to prove this result.As shown in Fig. 4a andb, the generated TiO 2 nanoparticles are surrounded by ZIF-8, and the peripheral surface is terminated by ZIF-8.The generated TiO 2 presents a plane spacing with the value of approximately 0.343 nm (Fig. 4b), which is relative to the (101) lattice plane of the generated TiO 2 .Meanwhile, the SEM images (Fig. S4 ) show that the particles of TiO 2 /ZIF-8-SX are held together and TiO 2 /ZIF-8-SX exhibits similar morphology, compared to that of ZIF-8.Moreover, the TEM images (Fig. 4c andd) of TiO 2 /ZIF-8-S2 are provided, demonstrating the existence of TiO 2 , and indicate that TiO 2 may be embedded into the framework of ZIF-8 together with its SEM image. 48The photocatalysts prepared by different methods possess different structures.The above results show that the synthetic method employed for preparing the composite photocatalyst has an important inuence on the structure and morphology of the samples. The photoreduction of CO 2 has been carried out through a solid-gas reaction mode by placing TiO 2 , ZIF-8 and TiO 2 /ZIF-8 photocatalysts in a homemade reactor full of CO 2 and several drops of water.This reaction mode is chosen due to its relative high product selectivity, and inhibited comparative H 2 generation reaction.The detailed experimental results of various photocatalysts on the CO 2 photoreduction are present and given in Fig. 6.It is obvious that CO and trace H 2 have been observed for all samples.It should be mentioned that TiO 2 /ZIF-8-GX creates a high selectivity for CO 2 photoreduction.The formation rate of CO increases from 14.63 to 21.74 mmol g A1 h A1 , and then decreases to 15.9 mmol g A1 h A1 aer irradiation for 2 h.Conversely, the as-synthesized TiO 2 and ZIF-8 exhibited CO formation rates of 7.53 and 1.87 mmol g A1 h A1 , respectively, under the same experimental conditions, revealing their much lower CO 2 photoreduction efficiencies. In order to investigate the inuence of the synthetic method on the photocatalytic performances, the solid synthesis method was used to prepare this type of photocatalyst.Then, the composite photocatalysts prepared via the solid synthesis method were employed to evaluate their ability for reducing CO 2 .These photocatalysts possess similar photocatalytic behaviours.Three samples have similar formation rates of CO aer irradiation for 2 h (9.82, 10.67 and 9.80 mmol g A1 h A1 for TiO 2 /ZIF-8-S1, TiO 2 /ZIF-8-S2 and TiO 2 /ZIF-8-S3, respectively).Naturally, TiO 2 /ZIF-8-S2 exhibits the best performance.Obviously, the CO formation rates of TiO 2 /ZIF-8-SX are lower than those of TiO 2 /ZIF-8-GX.Summarily, TiO 2 /ZIF-8-SX exhibited inferior activities compared to the performances of TiO 2 /ZIF-8-GX.The different photocatalytic performances of two kinds of photocatalysts may probably result from their different structures.In order to excavate the inuence of the structure on the photocatalytic performance, TiO 2 from the etching of TiO 2 /ZIF-8-G2 and TiO 2 /ZIF-8-S2 was collected and employed to evaluate their photocatalytic performances.It should be mentioned that the crystallinity of TiO 2 resulting from TiO 2 /ZIF-8-G2 is lower than that of TiO 2 obtained from TiO 2 /ZIF-8-S2, conrmed by their PXRD patterns (Fig. S5 ).The formation rates of CO are 7.50 and 5.88 mmol g A1 h A1 , respectively (Fig. S6 ), and TiO 2 derived from TiO 2 /ZIF-8-G2 exhibited better photocatalytic performances than that of TiO 2 from TiO 2 /ZIF-8-S2.The experimental results reveal that TiO 2 with low crystallinity is benecial for CO 2 reduction. 58Exposed defects induced by the low crystallinity of TiO 2 in TiO 2 /ZIF-8-GX can facilitate the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes, which favours the improvement of photocatalytic activities.ICP measurements have also been performed.The calculated results display that two types of photocatalysts possess different molar ratios of Ti to Zn, and the molar ratios of Ti to Zn in TiO 2 /ZIF-8-GX are higher (Tables S1 andS2 ), indicating that TiO 2 /ZIF-8-GX could provide more reaction actives.Besides, the distribution of ZIF-8 at the surface of TiO 2 in TiO 2 /ZIF-8-GX not only enriches CO 2 , but also prevents the aggregation of TiO 2 .In a word, the structural features of TiO 2 /ZIF-8-GX prefer to reduce CO 2 under the irradiation of light.Conversely, the structures of TiO 2 /ZIF-8-SX are unfavourable to reduce CO 2 because TiO 2 with good crystallinity cannot suppress the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes effectively, and the photocatalytic active sites of TiO 2 are difficult to form contacts with CO 2 because they are trapped in the skeleton of ZIF-8. The experimental phenomena show that the introduction of ZIF-8 indeed improves the CO 2 photoreduction performances of the composite photocatalysts.The optimized performance comes from TiO 2 /ZIF-8-G2, and its photocatalytic production yields at the given times are 5.04, 13.38, 31.85 and 43.49mmol g A1 (Fig. 6c).Compared to the original TiO 2 and ZIF-8, as well as TiO 2 derived from TiO 2 /ZIF-8-G2 and TiO 2 /ZIF-8-S2, the photocatalytic efficiency of TiO 2 /ZIF-8-G2 increases by two, eleven and two times, respectively.For composite photocatalysts with varied amounts of TiO 2 , the experimental results reveal that the photocatalytic performances improve rst, and then decrease along with the increased amount of TiO 2 .We speculate that the increased mass ratio of TiO 2 could provide more reactive sites.However, too much TiO 2 hinders the CO 2 absorption ability of the composite photocatalysts, suppressing the benets of the increased active sites.The enhanced photocatalytic performance of TiO 2 /ZIF-8-GX is mainly due to the well-integrated structure, and could result from the following issues: (i) ZIF-8 in the composites owns a large surface area, and is favourable for capturing CO 2 ; (ii) the distribution of ZIF-8 in the TiO 2 matrix can effectively avoid the aggregation of TiO 2 and make TiO 2 expose more reaction active sites; (iii) the low crystallinity of TiO 2 /ZIF-8-GX can create more defects at the surface, which can accelerate the separation of the photogenerated electrons and holes.Naturally, the above factors make TiO 2 /ZIF-8-GX possess high photocatalytic activity.Previous achievements have demonstrated that the great CO 2 adsorption capability can benet from enhancing the photocatalytic performance. 596006162 Naturally, the CO 2 absorption capacities of all samples have been evaluated at room temperature.The experimental ndings exhibit TiO 2 /ZIF-8-GX with CO 2 uptakes of 9.9, 12.1 and 12.6 cm 3 g A1 (Fig. 5) at 298 K, respectively.TiO 2 /ZIF-8-SX exhibited CO 2 uptakes of 9.84, 9.87 and 11.59 cm 3 g A1 (Fig. S7 ) at 298 K, which are lower than those of the corresponding TiO 2 /ZIF-8-GX.ZIF-8 shows a CO 2 uptake of 17.0 cm 3 g A1 , 63 while TiO 2 exhibits nearly no adsorption of CO 2 . To demonstrate that the product actually comes from the photoreduction of CO 2 , the control experiments were performed.First, the homemade reactor in the absence of photocatalysts does not respond to light irradiation.Second, TiO 2 / ZIF-8-G2 shows no photocatalytic responses in N 2 and H 2 O vapours.When CO 2 is used to replace N 2 , a remarkable photocatalytic response is observed.Similar experimental ndings can also be achieved for TiO 2 and TiO 2 /ZIF-8-S2.In addition, the control experiment employing a physical mixture of TiO 2 and ZIF-8 as photocatalysts exhibits lower activity than those of TiO 2 /ZIF-8-GX, and its formation rate of CO is 8.21 mmol g A1 h A1 . In order to highlight the excellence of our work, the previous covered photocatalysts based on MOF and semiconductors are summarized and listed in Table 1.Naturally, the reported experimental ndings are used for comparison with precious experimental results. 646556667686970 As shown in Table 1, most of the photocatalysts can only convert CO 2 into CO, and the photocatalytic performance of TiO 2 /ZIF-8-G2 is located at a high level compared to other similar photocatalysts.This comparison implies that the structure of TiO 2 /ZIF-8-GX is favourable for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 . The UV-Vis diffuse reectance spectra of ZIF-8, TiO 2 and TiO 2 / ZIF-8-GX, as well as TiO 2 /ZIF-8-SX have been measured to evaluate their light absorption ability (Fig. 7a calculated to be 3.26 eV, 5.05 eV, 3.23 eV, 3.13 eV, 3.24 eV by the Kubelka-Munk (KM) method, respectively (Fig. 7b).With the help of the same calculation method, the band gaps of TiO 2 /ZIF-8-S1/2/3 are obtained to be 3.26 eV, 3.25 eV and 3.27 eV, respectively.To reveal their band structures, the Mott-Schottky (MS) measurements of TiO 2 , ZIF-8 and TiO 2 /ZIF-8-G1/2/3, as well as TiO 2 /ZIF-8-S1/2/3, were also carried out (Fig. 7c, S10 and S11 ).With the help of the Mott-Schottky equations, the electronic band positions of TiO 2 /ZIF-8-GX and TiO 2 /ZIF-8-SX could be found.The conduction band (CB) positions of TiO 2 /ZIF-8-G1/ 2/3 and TiO 2 /ZIF-8-S1/2/3 were determined to be A1.08,A1.14, A1.10, A1.02, A1.07 and A1.06 eV (vs.Ag/AgCl), respectively.Their valence band (VB) positions were calculated to be 2.13, 1.97, 2.12, 2.24, 2.23 and 2.21 eV, respectively, according to the band gaps coming from the UV-Vis absorption data (Fig. 7b). Naturally, the energy band structures of TiO 2 and ZIF-8 can be established based on this calculation, and is shown in Fig. S10. Among all photocatalysts, it is clearly shown that the CB position of TiO 2 /ZIF-8-G2 is more negative than the reduction potential of CO 2 converting into CO, which makes it easier to photoreduce CO 2 . The photocurrent density spectra are able to reect the separation ability of the photo-induced charges.These data of all composite photocatalysts clearly reveal that the photocurrent density increases in the order of TiO 2 /ZIF-8-S3 TiO 2 /ZIF-8-S1 TiO 2 /ZIF-8-S2 TiO 2 /ZIF-8-G3 TiO 2 /ZIF-8-G1 TiO 2 /ZIF-8-G2 (Fig. 7d and S9c ).Obviously, the photocurrent responses of TiO 2 /ZIF-8-GX are stronger than those of TiO 2 /ZIF-8-SX, which are consistent with their photocatalytic results.Among them, TiO 2 /ZIF-8-G2 possesses the maximum photocurrent density under the irradiation of light, and its high photocurrent response can be ascribed to the lower recombination rate of photogenerated electrons and holes pairs.Besides, the electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS) is demonstrated to be a promising method for investigating the interfacial charge transfer.As shown in Fig. 7e andS9d, the EIS plots of TiO 2 /ZIF-8-G2 show the smallest radius among all TiO 2 /ZIF-8-GX photocatalysts.Smaller resistances result in better conductivity and prefer to transfer the photogenerated electrons.It should be mentioned that the smallest radius of TiO 2 /ZIF-8-G2 corresponds to the result of the photocurrent measurements and CO 2 photoreduction performance. In addition, the photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra of TiO 2 /ZIF-8-GX, ZIF-8 and TiO 2 were performed to study the ability of the photogenerated charge carrier transfer.As shown in Fig. 7f, the PL emissions of TiO 2 /ZIF-8-GX were quenched signicantly compared to those of ZIF-8 and TiO 2 , revealing the inhibited photoinduced charge recombination existing in TiO 2 / ZIF-8-GX.This is because the defects induced by the low crystallinity of TiO 2 /ZIF-8-GX offer many charge transfer pathways for photogenerated electrons.Additionally, the ZIF-8 shell makes an important contribution to the transfer of photogenerated electrons due to its more positive conduction band.Both of them hinder the recombination of photoelectrons and holes, resulting in enhanced photocatalytic performances. The possible CO 2 photoreduction reaction pathways of TiO 2 / ZIF-8-GX and the corresponding possible mechanism are proposed to explain the synergistic effects between TiO 2 and ZIF-8 on the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 (Fig. 8).This is because ZIF-8 possesses a large surface area, and is mainly responsible for CO 2 and H 2 O uptake.CO 2 and water molecules rst enter the pores of ZIF-8, and can subsequently migrate to the surface of TiO 2 through interconnected channels in the framework.Under the irradiation of light, several common intermediates (e.g., CO 3 ) 49 are generated with the help of the chemisorption between CO 2 and the surface of TiO 2 .TiO 2 serves as the photocatalyst, and produces electrons and holes.Naturally, the photogenerated electrons gather together at the interfaces between TiO 2 and ZIF-8, and then take part in the photoreduction of abundant CO 2 and H 2 O inside ZIF-8, promoting the progress of the photocatalytic reaction (Fig. 8).Meanwhile, the adsorbed water forms contacts with the holes in TiO 2 , and then produces protons and OHc. 71The appearance of this process is demonstrated by the successful detection of OHc (Fig. S12 ).Finally, the intermediates produce the nal product of CO with the help of the generated electrons and protons."}, {"llm generation": "TiO2", "source": "It should be mentioned that a weak diffraction peak at 25.7 is responsible for the (101) plane of TiO 2 .", "context": "One family of TiO 2 /ZIF-8 composite photocatalysts has been prepared by the grinding method using an in situ synthetic process (experiment details in Experimental section), and is dened as TiO 2 /ZIF-8-GX (X 14 1, 2 and 3, corresponding to the different volumes of used Ti(OiPr) 4 ).For comparison, another family of TiO 2 /ZIF-8 composite photocatalysts was also prepared using the same reaction substrates with the help of the solid-synthesis method, namely ZIF-8/TiO 2 -SX (X 14 1, 2 and 3, corresponding to the different volumes of used Ti(OiPr) 4 ).In order to conrm the successful formation of ZIF-8 and TiO 2 , all as-synthesized powders have been identied via the powder Xray diffraction (PXRD) patterns.The crystallinities of TiO 2 /ZIF-8-GX are not well-dened.Only several weak peaks (around 10.4 , 12.5 and 18.5 ) are observed, which are consistent with the simulated PXRD pattern of ZIF-8 (Fig. 1a and S3 ).In addition, there is a broad peak between 20 and 40 relative to TiO 2 , which can be attributed to the anatase TiO 2 (JCPDS no.21-1272). 51Additionally, the PXRD patterns of TiO 2 /ZIF-8-SX were performed.Their patterns exhibit good diffraction peaks, and match well with that of ZIF-8, implying that the good crystallinity of ZIF-8 is well maintained (Fig. S2 ).It should be mentioned that a weak diffraction peak at 25.7 is responsible for the (101) plane of TiO 2 . In addition, the Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were used to analyze the surface chemistry of the prepared TiO 2 / ZIF-8 composite photocatalysts.As shown in Fig. 1b .Besides, the peak at 420 cm A1 in the spectra belongs to the stretching vibrations of the Zn-N bonds. 52,53Additionally, the broad peaks from 500 to 800 cm A1 are ascribed to the stretching vibrations of the Ti-O bonds. 54,55As shown in Fig. S1 2a).The XPS spectrum of Ti exhibits two peaks at 458.6 eV and 464.3 eV, which are relative to the binding energies of Ti 2p 3/2 and Ti 2p 1/2 , respectively (Fig. 2b).This implies the existence of the oxidation state Ti 4 in TiO 2 /ZIF-8-G2.As seen in Fig. 2c, the binding energies at 1022.1 eV and 1045.1 eV belong to the Zn 2p 3/2 and Zn 2p 1/2 , respectively.Fig. 2d shows that two peaks at around 284.7 eV and 288.5 eV are assigned to the C-C and C-N bonds from the imidazole groups in the C 1s spectrum, respectively.Additionally, in the spectrum of N, two peaks (399.3 and 400.9 eV) can be attributed to -NHand C-N, respectively (Fig. 2e).In the O 1s spectrum, one main peak at 530.3 eV belongs to the Ti-O bonds, and the other peak with weak intensity at 531.6 eV is attributed to the lattice oxygen atoms in TiO 2 (Fig. 2f). 56,57In summary, all characterization results indicate that the successful combination of TiO 2 and ZIF-8 has been realized. The obtained photocatalysts have been used to evaluate their surface morphology with the help of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images.The morphologies of ZIF-8, TiO 2 and TiO 2 /ZIF-8-GX are found to be different by SEM images.The SEM images show that the particles of ZIF-8 possess the smooth surface and exhibit angular shapes (Fig. 3a andb).Fig. 3b shows that the as-synthesized TiO 2 particles are spherical with rough surfaces.In addition, the pure TiO 2 spheres can agglomerate together.As shown in Fig. 3c-e, most of the particles also maintain the sphere shape, but possess rougher surfaces, compared with that of the pure TiO 2 spheres, indicating that the ZIF-8 particles have successfully coated the surfaces of the TiO 2 spheres.The coating of ZIF-8 make TiO 2 /ZIF-8-GX greatly avoid the agglomeration of TiO 2 , which may enhance their catalytic activity.The elemental distribution of TiO 2 /ZIF-8-GX has been carried out with the help of element mapping.Fig. 3f clearly displays the element distribution of TiO 2 /ZIF-8-G2, where the cyan, red, grey, green and yellow colours represent the distributions of each element C, N, O, Ti and Zn, respectively.With the help of the element mapping, we can conrm that ZIF-8 was successfully located on the surface of the TiO 2 spheres.Summarily, in TiO 2 /ZIF-8-GX, ZIF-8 is located at the surface of the TiO 2 spheres.In order to justify our hypothesis, taking TiO 2 / ZIF-8-G2 as an example, transmission electron microscope (TEM) images have been used to prove this result.As shown in Fig. 4a andb, the generated TiO 2 nanoparticles are surrounded by ZIF-8, and the peripheral surface is terminated by ZIF-8.The generated TiO 2 presents a plane spacing with the value of approximately 0.343 nm (Fig. 4b), which is relative to the (101) lattice plane of the generated TiO 2 .Meanwhile, the SEM images (Fig. S4 ) show that the particles of TiO 2 /ZIF-8-SX are held together and TiO 2 /ZIF-8-SX exhibits similar morphology, compared to that of ZIF-8.Moreover, the TEM images (Fig. 4c andd) of TiO 2 /ZIF-8-S2 are provided, demonstrating the existence of TiO 2 , and indicate that TiO 2 may be embedded into the framework of ZIF-8 together with its SEM image. 48The photocatalysts prepared by different methods possess different structures.The above results show that the synthetic method employed for preparing the composite photocatalyst has an important inuence on the structure and morphology of the samples. The photoreduction of CO 2 has been carried out through a solid-gas reaction mode by placing TiO 2 , ZIF-8 and TiO 2 /ZIF-8 photocatalysts in a homemade reactor full of CO 2 and several drops of water.This reaction mode is chosen due to its relative high product selectivity, and inhibited comparative H 2 generation reaction.The detailed experimental results of various photocatalysts on the CO 2 photoreduction are present and given in Fig. 6.It is obvious that CO and trace H 2 have been observed for all samples.It should be mentioned that TiO 2 /ZIF-8-GX creates a high selectivity for CO 2 photoreduction.The formation rate of CO increases from 14.63 to 21.74 mmol g A1 h A1 , and then decreases to 15.9 mmol g A1 h A1 aer irradiation for 2 h.Conversely, the as-synthesized TiO 2 and ZIF-8 exhibited CO formation rates of 7.53 and 1.87 mmol g A1 h A1 , respectively, under the same experimental conditions, revealing their much lower CO 2 photoreduction efficiencies. In order to investigate the inuence of the synthetic method on the photocatalytic performances, the solid synthesis method was used to prepare this type of photocatalyst.Then, the composite photocatalysts prepared via the solid synthesis method were employed to evaluate their ability for reducing CO 2 .These photocatalysts possess similar photocatalytic behaviours.Three samples have similar formation rates of CO aer irradiation for 2 h (9.82, 10.67 and 9.80 mmol g A1 h A1 for TiO 2 /ZIF-8-S1, TiO 2 /ZIF-8-S2 and TiO 2 /ZIF-8-S3, respectively).Naturally, TiO 2 /ZIF-8-S2 exhibits the best performance.Obviously, the CO formation rates of TiO 2 /ZIF-8-SX are lower than those of TiO 2 /ZIF-8-GX.Summarily, TiO 2 /ZIF-8-SX exhibited inferior activities compared to the performances of TiO 2 /ZIF-8-GX.The different photocatalytic performances of two kinds of photocatalysts may probably result from their different structures.In order to excavate the inuence of the structure on the photocatalytic performance, TiO 2 from the etching of TiO 2 /ZIF-8-G2 and TiO 2 /ZIF-8-S2 was collected and employed to evaluate their photocatalytic performances.It should be mentioned that the crystallinity of TiO 2 resulting from TiO 2 /ZIF-8-G2 is lower than that of TiO 2 obtained from TiO 2 /ZIF-8-S2, conrmed by their PXRD patterns (Fig. S5 ).The formation rates of CO are 7.50 and 5.88 mmol g A1 h A1 , respectively (Fig. S6 ), and TiO 2 derived from TiO 2 /ZIF-8-G2 exhibited better photocatalytic performances than that of TiO 2 from TiO 2 /ZIF-8-S2.The experimental results reveal that TiO 2 with low crystallinity is benecial for CO 2 reduction. 58Exposed defects induced by the low crystallinity of TiO 2 in TiO 2 /ZIF-8-GX can facilitate the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes, which favours the improvement of photocatalytic activities.ICP measurements have also been performed.The calculated results display that two types of photocatalysts possess different molar ratios of Ti to Zn, and the molar ratios of Ti to Zn in TiO 2 /ZIF-8-GX are higher (Tables S1 andS2 ), indicating that TiO 2 /ZIF-8-GX could provide more reaction actives.Besides, the distribution of ZIF-8 at the surface of TiO 2 in TiO 2 /ZIF-8-GX not only enriches CO 2 , but also prevents the aggregation of TiO 2 .In a word, the structural features of TiO 2 /ZIF-8-GX prefer to reduce CO 2 under the irradiation of light.Conversely, the structures of TiO 2 /ZIF-8-SX are unfavourable to reduce CO 2 because TiO 2 with good crystallinity cannot suppress the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes effectively, and the photocatalytic active sites of TiO 2 are difficult to form contacts with CO 2 because they are trapped in the skeleton of ZIF-8. The experimental phenomena show that the introduction of ZIF-8 indeed improves the CO 2 photoreduction performances of the composite photocatalysts.The optimized performance comes from TiO 2 /ZIF-8-G2, and its photocatalytic production yields at the given times are 5.04, 13.38, 31.85 and 43.49mmol g A1 (Fig. 6c).Compared to the original TiO 2 and ZIF-8, as well as TiO 2 derived from TiO 2 /ZIF-8-G2 and TiO 2 /ZIF-8-S2, the photocatalytic efficiency of TiO 2 /ZIF-8-G2 increases by two, eleven and two times, respectively.For composite photocatalysts with varied amounts of TiO 2 , the experimental results reveal that the photocatalytic performances improve rst, and then decrease along with the increased amount of TiO 2 .We speculate that the increased mass ratio of TiO 2 could provide more reactive sites.However, too much TiO 2 hinders the CO 2 absorption ability of the composite photocatalysts, suppressing the benets of the increased active sites.The enhanced photocatalytic performance of TiO 2 /ZIF-8-GX is mainly due to the well-integrated structure, and could result from the following issues: (i) ZIF-8 in the composites owns a large surface area, and is favourable for capturing CO 2 ; (ii) the distribution of ZIF-8 in the TiO 2 matrix can effectively avoid the aggregation of TiO 2 and make TiO 2 expose more reaction active sites; (iii) the low crystallinity of TiO 2 /ZIF-8-GX can create more defects at the surface, which can accelerate the separation of the photogenerated electrons and holes.Naturally, the above factors make TiO 2 /ZIF-8-GX possess high photocatalytic activity.Previous achievements have demonstrated that the great CO 2 adsorption capability can benet from enhancing the photocatalytic performance. 596006162 Naturally, the CO 2 absorption capacities of all samples have been evaluated at room temperature.The experimental ndings exhibit TiO 2 /ZIF-8-GX with CO 2 uptakes of 9.9, 12.1 and 12.6 cm 3 g A1 (Fig. 5) at 298 K, respectively.TiO 2 /ZIF-8-SX exhibited CO 2 uptakes of 9.84, 9.87 and 11.59 cm 3 g A1 (Fig. S7 ) at 298 K, which are lower than those of the corresponding TiO 2 /ZIF-8-GX.ZIF-8 shows a CO 2 uptake of 17.0 cm 3 g A1 , 63 while TiO 2 exhibits nearly no adsorption of CO 2 . To demonstrate that the product actually comes from the photoreduction of CO 2 , the control experiments were performed.First, the homemade reactor in the absence of photocatalysts does not respond to light irradiation.Second, TiO 2 / ZIF-8-G2 shows no photocatalytic responses in N 2 and H 2 O vapours.When CO 2 is used to replace N 2 , a remarkable photocatalytic response is observed.Similar experimental ndings can also be achieved for TiO 2 and TiO 2 /ZIF-8-S2.In addition, the control experiment employing a physical mixture of TiO 2 and ZIF-8 as photocatalysts exhibits lower activity than those of TiO 2 /ZIF-8-GX, and its formation rate of CO is 8.21 mmol g A1 h A1 . In order to highlight the excellence of our work, the previous covered photocatalysts based on MOF and semiconductors are summarized and listed in Table 1.Naturally, the reported experimental ndings are used for comparison with precious experimental results. 646556667686970 As shown in Table 1, most of the photocatalysts can only convert CO 2 into CO, and the photocatalytic performance of TiO 2 /ZIF-8-G2 is located at a high level compared to other similar photocatalysts.This comparison implies that the structure of TiO 2 /ZIF-8-GX is favourable for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 . The UV-Vis diffuse reectance spectra of ZIF-8, TiO 2 and TiO 2 / ZIF-8-GX, as well as TiO 2 /ZIF-8-SX have been measured to evaluate their light absorption ability (Fig. 7a calculated to be 3.26 eV, 5.05 eV, 3.23 eV, 3.13 eV, 3.24 eV by the Kubelka-Munk (KM) method, respectively (Fig. 7b).With the help of the same calculation method, the band gaps of TiO 2 /ZIF-8-S1/2/3 are obtained to be 3.26 eV, 3.25 eV and 3.27 eV, respectively.To reveal their band structures, the Mott-Schottky (MS) measurements of TiO 2 , ZIF-8 and TiO 2 /ZIF-8-G1/2/3, as well as TiO 2 /ZIF-8-S1/2/3, were also carried out (Fig. 7c, S10 and S11 ).With the help of the Mott-Schottky equations, the electronic band positions of TiO 2 /ZIF-8-GX and TiO 2 /ZIF-8-SX could be found.The conduction band (CB) positions of TiO 2 /ZIF-8-G1/ 2/3 and TiO 2 /ZIF-8-S1/2/3 were determined to be A1.08,A1.14, A1.10, A1.02, A1.07 and A1.06 eV (vs.Ag/AgCl), respectively.Their valence band (VB) positions were calculated to be 2.13, 1.97, 2.12, 2.24, 2.23 and 2.21 eV, respectively, according to the band gaps coming from the UV-Vis absorption data (Fig. 7b). Naturally, the energy band structures of TiO 2 and ZIF-8 can be established based on this calculation, and is shown in Fig. S10. Among all photocatalysts, it is clearly shown that the CB position of TiO 2 /ZIF-8-G2 is more negative than the reduction potential of CO 2 converting into CO, which makes it easier to photoreduce CO 2 . The photocurrent density spectra are able to reect the separation ability of the photo-induced charges.These data of all composite photocatalysts clearly reveal that the photocurrent density increases in the order of TiO 2 /ZIF-8-S3 TiO 2 /ZIF-8-S1 TiO 2 /ZIF-8-S2 TiO 2 /ZIF-8-G3 TiO 2 /ZIF-8-G1 TiO 2 /ZIF-8-G2 (Fig. 7d and S9c ).Obviously, the photocurrent responses of TiO 2 /ZIF-8-GX are stronger than those of TiO 2 /ZIF-8-SX, which are consistent with their photocatalytic results.Among them, TiO 2 /ZIF-8-G2 possesses the maximum photocurrent density under the irradiation of light, and its high photocurrent response can be ascribed to the lower recombination rate of photogenerated electrons and holes pairs.Besides, the electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS) is demonstrated to be a promising method for investigating the interfacial charge transfer.As shown in Fig. 7e andS9d, the EIS plots of TiO 2 /ZIF-8-G2 show the smallest radius among all TiO 2 /ZIF-8-GX photocatalysts.Smaller resistances result in better conductivity and prefer to transfer the photogenerated electrons.It should be mentioned that the smallest radius of TiO 2 /ZIF-8-G2 corresponds to the result of the photocurrent measurements and CO 2 photoreduction performance. In addition, the photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra of TiO 2 /ZIF-8-GX, ZIF-8 and TiO 2 were performed to study the ability of the photogenerated charge carrier transfer.As shown in Fig. 7f, the PL emissions of TiO 2 /ZIF-8-GX were quenched signicantly compared to those of ZIF-8 and TiO 2 , revealing the inhibited photoinduced charge recombination existing in TiO 2 / ZIF-8-GX.This is because the defects induced by the low crystallinity of TiO 2 /ZIF-8-GX offer many charge transfer pathways for photogenerated electrons.Additionally, the ZIF-8 shell makes an important contribution to the transfer of photogenerated electrons due to its more positive conduction band.Both of them hinder the recombination of photoelectrons and holes, resulting in enhanced photocatalytic performances. The possible CO 2 photoreduction reaction pathways of TiO 2 / ZIF-8-GX and the corresponding possible mechanism are proposed to explain the synergistic effects between TiO 2 and ZIF-8 on the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 (Fig. 8).This is because ZIF-8 possesses a large surface area, and is mainly responsible for CO 2 and H 2 O uptake.CO 2 and water molecules rst enter the pores of ZIF-8, and can subsequently migrate to the surface of TiO 2 through interconnected channels in the framework.Under the irradiation of light, several common intermediates (e.g., CO 3 ) 49 are generated with the help of the chemisorption between CO 2 and the surface of TiO 2 .TiO 2 serves as the photocatalyst, and produces electrons and holes.Naturally, the photogenerated electrons gather together at the interfaces between TiO 2 and ZIF-8, and then take part in the photoreduction of abundant CO 2 and H 2 O inside ZIF-8, promoting the progress of the photocatalytic reaction (Fig. 8).Meanwhile, the adsorbed water forms contacts with the holes in TiO 2 , and then produces protons and OHc. 71The appearance of this process is demonstrated by the successful detection of OHc (Fig. S12 ).Finally, the intermediates produce the nal product of CO with the help of the generated electrons and protons."}, {"llm generation": "binary semiconductor/ZIF photocatalysts (TiO 2 /ZIF-8)", "source": "In summary, various binary semiconductor/ZIF photocatalysts (TiO 2 /ZIF-8) have been fabricated with the help of the grinding method and the solid synthesis method.", "context": "In summary, various binary semiconductor/ZIF photocatalysts (TiO 2 /ZIF-8) have been fabricated with the help of the grinding method and the solid synthesis method.The photocatalysts prepared by the grinding method exhibit better photocatalytic performances than those of the photocatalysts fabricated by the solid synthesis method.The experimental nding demonstrates that different synthetic methods result in varied photocatalytic performances, caused by their different structural features.The resulting TiO 2 /ZIF-8-GX exhibits enhanced photocatalytic reduction efficiencies toward CO 2 compared to pure TiO 2 and ZIF-8, as well as TiO 2 /ZIF-8-SX, and TiO 2 /ZIF-8-G2 exhibits the highest CO formation rate of 21.74 mmol g A1 h A1 .The good performance could be attributed to the enhanced CO 2 Nanoscale Advances absorption ability and the well-integrated structure, which can expose more active sites and absorb more CO 2 .This work may offer some guidance for designing composited photocatalysts with high efficiency.
