Details on the characterization are shown in Note 2 in the supporting information. A catalytic oxidation test of NO at atmospheric pressure was carried out in a fixed bed reactor.Its key part is a quartz tube with an inner diameter of 6.8 mm.Before each test, 300 mg catalyst (40e60 mesh) was loaded in it with quartz wool blocking both ends.A gas mixture of 400 ppm NO, 8 vol O 2 and N 2 as the balance gas was passed through the catalyst bed at a gas hour space velocity (GHSV) of 35,400 h A1 .A 90-min reaction was isothermally tested every 50 C from 150 C to 400 C. The gas products were analyzed by a flue gas analyzer (Ecom-JZKN, Germany) and NO conversion was determined according to the following equation: NO conversion to NO 2 14 (NO in e NO out ) / NO in 100 Using the software package DMol3 30,31, the exchange and correlation energies were investigated based on spin-polarized DFT calculations treated within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) using the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional 32.The Brillouin zone was sampled by the Monkhorst-Pack 4 A 4 A 1 grid.A Fermi smearing of 0.1 eV was utilized.The convergence criteria used for the geometry optimizations were 10 A5 eV and 0.002 eV A A1 for the total energy and forces acting on the ions, respectively. CO 2 photocatalytic reduction was conducted in a gas-closed circulation system by applying a 200 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel reactor (Anhui Kemi Machinery Technology Co., Ltd., China).First, 50 mg photocatalyst was uniformly dispersed into the black Teflon container with 15 mL deionized water, and the suspension was stirred during the reaction.The reactor was purified with highpurity CO 2 (99.99) gas to the pressure of 0.6 MPa for the CO 2 photoreduction.Then, a 300 W Xe lamp (CEL-HXF300, Beijing CEAulight Co., Ltd., China) with a UV-light cut-off filter (l 420 nm) as the light source irradiated the sapphire at the top of the reactor.The temperature of the reactor was controlled at 60 C via the circulating cooling water.After photoreaction for 6 h, the product in the reactor was injected into a gas chromatograph (GC-9860, Nanjing Hope Corp., China) slowly.The CH 4 , CH 3 OH, and other carbonbased gases were analyzed via a flame ionization detector (FID) equipped with a 5A molecular column and a TDX-01 packed column."}, {"llm generation": "UV-Vis", "source": "The surface electronic states and the band gap were obtained via UVevis DRS measurements, as shown in Fig. 7A.", "context": "Compared with the conventional syntheses of hollow-type CeO 2 structures, which require complicated, time-consuming, expensive templates 17, a one-pot technique for synthesizing CeO 2 hollow microspheres (adopting urea as a cheap template) is much more convenient.The synthesis process of CreCe mixed oxides with a double-shelled hollow morphology is illustrated in Fig. 1A.The addition of urea has a surprising influence on the hollow structure 28.The synthesized 10CCE-U31 hollow microspheres display a double-shelled structure in which four cores are located within the second shell.The effects of urea on the physical structure of the sample are shown in Fig. 1B, andC.Both 10CCE-U31 and 10CCE exhibit four main peaks corresponding to the CeO 2 cubic structure (JCPDS No. 34e0394) 33.Two catalysts display similar patterns, indicating that the addition of urea did not influence the formation of crystal structures.Additionally, compared with pure CeO 2 , the XRD peaks of both catalysts shift to higher angles.Because the radius of Cr 3 (r Cr 3 14 0.0615 nm) is smaller than that of Ce 4 (r Ce 4 14 0.097 nm), we conclude that the Cr was doped into the CeO 2 lattice.As listed in Table 1, 10CCE-U31 exhibits a higher BET surface area than 10CCE.In addition, the N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of both catalysts are different; 10CCE displays a type III isotherm with a type H3 hysteresis loop, whereas 10CCE-U31 displays a type IV isotherm with a type H4 hysteresis loop 34,35, as shown in Fig. S1.The SEM images reveal the differences in the BET surface areas of the two catalysts; the BET surface area of 10CCE is mainly generated by the aggregates of small nanospheres, whereas the BET surface area of 10CCE-U31 results from its hollow structure, thus the average pore size of 10CCE is higher than that of 10CCE-U31, as shown in Table 1.The above results indicate that the addition of urea mainly influenced the morphologies of CreCe mixed oxides rather than the crystal structure. The varying Cr content in CeO 2 was investigated to study its impacts on the structure of the mixed metal oxides.As shown in Fig. 2, with an increasing content of the Cr-containing precursor, obvious angle shifts appear for the 5CCE-U31, 7CCE-U31 and 10CCE-U31 samples in their XRD patterns.Moreover, there is no CrO x peak among the catalyst peaks, which indicates that all Cr atoms were doped into the CeO 2 lattice.The N 2 adsorptiondesorption isotherms of the catalysts with different Cr doping amounts are shown in Fig. S2A.The catalysts all exhibit type IV isotherms with type H4 hysteresis loops, indicating the existence of a narrow stenopaic pore structure 35.The BET results are illustrated in Table 1, displaying that the surface area, pore volume and pore size increased as the Cr doping increased.These findings indicate that the addition of Cr atoms in conjunction with Ce atoms was beneficial for the generation of pores during the hydrothermal process, confirming the results of a previous study 36.Additionally, the increase in Cr doping could enlarge the pore size.SEM images of the xCCE-U31 series catalysts are shown in Fig. 3A.The varying Cr doping did not obviously influence the morphologies of the catalysts.However, all catalysts display the obvious doubleshelled shape in the TEM images (Fig. 3B).The number of particles attached to the outmost shell increased as the Cr doping increased, which is attributed to the expansile pore structure caused by Cr doping.Combined with the BET results, the generated pores on the shell could facilitate the transport of reactants and increase the number of the exposed active sites, thereby promoting the catalytic performance. The surface element valence state over the catalysts with varying Cr doping was analyzed by XPS characterization, as shown in Fig. 4. The survey spectra confirm the survival of Ce, Cr, and O in the catalysts.In the 2p3/2 region of the Cr 2p spectra, all catalysts are fitted into Cr 3 and Cr 6 states, which are assigned to the Cr 2 O 3 species and CrO 3 species, respectively.The peak with the highest binding energy is attributed to the Cr 6 species and the other peaks correspond to the Cr 3 species 37.The 3d spectrum of Ce is fitted into eight peaks in several different regions (3d5/2: v series, 3d3/2: u series) via Gaussian fitting, in which the peaks labeled v, v'', v''' and u, u'', u''' are assigned to the Ce 4 state and the v' and u' peaks are attributed to the Ce 3 state 38.Two main peaks can be separated after fitting for the O 1s spectra: one peak is denoted O a , corresponding to the lattice oxygen (O 2A ) at a lower binding energy, and the other is denoted O b , corresponding to the chemisorbed oxygen, such as O 2 A or O A at a higher binding energy 39.From the Cr 2p spectrum, the peak intensities and ratios of Cr 6 to Cr 3 increase with an increase in the Cr doping.The influence of different urea dosages on the physicochemical structure of the catalysts was also investigated, as shown in Fig. S2B and Fig. S4.The catalysts with different urea dosages display similar XRD patterns; they all shift to higher angles than that of pure CeO 2 .Additionally, an obvious impurity phase appears over the catalysts with a greater addition of urea.These series catalysts also exhibit a similar N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherm type, and 10CCE-U31 possesses the highest surface area and pore volume.The SEM images confirm the XRD results, displaying a similar morphology with a double-shelled hollow structure under different urea dosages.The surface element valence states over three typical catalysts 10CCE-Uy1 (y 14 1, 3, 5) were characterized via XPS, as shown in Fig. S5.The peak fitting processes of Cr 2p, Ce 3d and O 1s over the catalysts with different urea dosages are the same as those in the above XPS analysis.However, the fitting results, such as the Cr The particle sizes are concentrated over 1.5 mm, and the average particle size is 2.25 mm. A typical TEM image of 10CCE-U31 is displayed in Fig. 5A, which clearly confirms its double-shelled hollow structure.As exhibited in the HRTEM image (Fig. 5B), 10CCE-U31 nanocrystal subunits in the shell with an interplanar spacing of 0.321 nm matches the (1 1 1) crystallographic plane of cubic CeO 2 .The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) image (Fig. 5C) of 10CCE-U31 displays four main continuous rings corresponding to the (1 1 1), (2 0 0), (2 2 0) and (3 1 1) planes of CeO 2 in accordance with the XRD analysis.The uniform distribution of each element in every shell and the cores of the CreCe mixed oxide hollow microspheres investigated by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) element mapping is shown in Fig. 5D. The formation mechanism of the double-shelled hollow structure was discussed and confirmed by characterizations.SEM and TEM images of the uncalcinated 10CCE-U31 sample are shown in Fig. S7, and the results show that, before calcination, a singleshelled hollow sample was formed during the hydrothermal process.The XRD pattern and EDX element mapping of the uncalcinated sample were determined, as shown in Fig. S8.The XRD results show that the uncalcinated sample is similar to the calcined catalyst, and the EDX mapping results show that the Cr, Ce and O The BET surface area and pore structure of the xCCE-Uy1 series catalysts. BET surface area (m 2 /g) Pore volume (mm elements are well dispersed in the hollow microsphere.These results indicate that the structure of CeO 2 was formed during the hydrothermal process, and Cr was doped into CeO 2 lattice uniformly.Combined with the TEM images of the calcined sample, it could be concluded that a primary core-shell structure was generated after hydrothermal treatment, and the calcination process was the key step in forming the double-shelled hollow structure. As shown in Fig. 6A, H 2 -TPR was used to characterize the active sites on the surfaces of the catalysts.Several reduction peaks are found over all catalysts at the range of 100e600 C. The reduction of surface ceria oxide appears in the low-temperature region (I, 260e400 C) and the reduction of Cr 6 (Cr 6 to Cr 3 ) appears in the high-temperature region (II, 410e570 C) 40,41.The catalysts with high Cr doping display high reduction peaks in areas I and II, and 10CCE-U31 exhibits the highest reduction.The results indicate that an increase in the Cr doping could benefit the interactions between Cr and Ce species, thereby generating additional active sites.The appropriate addition of urea could further enhance these interactions.The TPR results are consistent with the XPS analysis.For the gas-phase reaction, the reactant adsorption capacity of the catalysts plays an important role.The NO and O 2 adsorption properties of all catalysts were tested by TPD experiments, as shown in Fig. 6B andC.From the NO-TPD profiles, two desorption peak regions are derived: the peak in the low-temperature area (a peak) is attributed to the monodentate nitrate and bridged nitrate, and others at high temperature (b peak) can be assigned to the bridged nitrate and bidentate nitrate 42.The catalysts with higher Cr doping display low a peak temperatures, indicating that these catalysts possess high NO adsorption capacities at low temperatures.Among the catalysts, 10CCE-U31 exhibits the highest a peak area, which might be due to its high Cr 6 content.In the O 2 -TPD results, three oxygen species are obtained in three separate temperature regions.The peak lower than 400 C (d peak) is caused by a kind of physically and weakly chemically adsorbed oxygen, and the peak higher than 550 C (g peak) is attributed to the oxygen in the lattice.The peak between the d peak and peak is derived from the oxygen defects ( peak), generally existing in the form of chemisorbed oxygen such as O A and O 2 A 43.The results show that 10CCE-U31 possesses the highest d peak and peak areas, indicating the abundance of chemisorbed oxygen on the surface in accordance with the XPS results.NO oxidation was carried out over all catalysts in the temperature range of 150e400 C to test the oxidizability, as shown in Fig. 6D.The catalytic activity over all catalysts first increases and then decreases with increasing temperature.The decrease in the oxidation activity at higher temperature is attributed to the limitation of thermodynamic equilibrium 44.Moreover, the oxidation efficiency increases with increased Cr doping, especially in the low-temperature region (150e200 C). Based on the oxidation performance, there is an optimum addition of urea that is three times the total metallic element content in the mole ratio.The NO oxidation results match the abovementioned XPS, TPR and TPD results.Among the catalysts, 10CCE-U31 exhibits the highest NO oxidation performance in the tested temperature region, and its highest oxidation activity is 83.3 at 300 C. Notably, 10CCE-U31 also displays excellent low-temperature activity.The efficiency reaches 42.8 at 150 C and 59.9 at 200 C, and the temperature point for an NO oxidation efficiency of 50 is 170 C; thus, 10CCE-U31 can satisfy the changes in the oxidation process after the desulfurization system to a certain degree.Moreover, the oxidation activities over most samples are in accordance with the thermodynamic equilibrium, excluding 10CCE-U21, 10CCE-U31, 10CCE-U41 and 10CCE-U51 at high temperature over 300 C, which all have 10 Cr doping.This phenomenon is attributed to the high oxidation efficiency caused by Cr active species, which was confirmed in our previous work 45.In addition, the stability of the optimized catalyst 10CCE-U31 was tested.As shown in Fig. S9, 10CCE-U31 displays stable NO oxidation efficiency under 300 C.Moreover, three \"cooling and heating\" cycling tests also confirmed the excellent stability of 10CCE-U31. To investigate the NO oxidation at lower temperatures, 10CCE-U31 was exposed to a gas mixture of 1000 ppm NO and 8 vol O 2 , and the temperature was increased to 250 C at an interval of 50 C in the in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) technique system.The spectrum was collected at 5 min and 30 min for each temperature, as shown in Fig. S10.Four typical bands were detected.First, the band at 1258 cm A1 can be attributed as bridged nitrate 46, and the band at 1043 cm A1 is assigned to monodentate nitrate 47.The band at 1353 cm A1 is attributed to the adsorbed NO 3 A , which can be formed by the interaction between chemisorbed NO and O 2 A 48.The band at 1400 cm A1 is assigned to the intermediate NO 49.The intensity of the bridged nitrate decreases with increasing temperature, and the intensities of the other three bands begin to increase at the same time.Among these bands, an intensity increase of the monodentate nitrate and adsorbed NO 3 A appears when the temperature increases to 200 C, and an intensity increase of intermediate NO appears at 250 C.These results confirm that the 10CCE-U31 catalyst possesses catalytic oxidation ability at low temperatures.We propose a NO oxidation mechanism over 10CCE-U31 based on the above analysis, as shown in Scheme 1.The adsorbed NO 3 A can react with the intermediate NO to generate two NO 2 molecules.The surface electronic states and the band gap were obtained via UVevis DRS measurements, as shown in Fig. 7A.Two typical absorption bands centered at 270 nm and 360 nm can be found in all the catalysts.These two bands are caused by Ce 4 ) O 2A charge transfer (270 nm) and interband (360 nm) transitions 50,51.No clear absorption band corresponding to the Ce 3 ) O 2A charge transfer transition is observed, which generally appeared at 255 nm 52.In addition, the bands attributed to Cr 3 and Cr 2 O 3 are usually centered at 460 nm and 590 nm, respectively 53, but they were not found over all catalysts.These results confirm that there are few CrO x species on the surface and that Cr is doped into the CeO 2 lattice.Based on the adsorption band edge, the band gap (Eg) of each catalyst was calculated, as shown in the inset in Fig. 7A.The band gap decreases with increasing Cr doping and the 10CCE-Uy1 series catalysts display similar Eg values, indicating that the different quantities of added urea exhibit little influence on the band gaps.The band gaps of the catalysts are listed in Table S1.As shown in Fig. 7B, we used Mott-Schottky measurements to clarify the band structures of the catalysts.For n-type semiconductors, reversed sigmoidal plots are realized with an overall shape consistent with that type.The flat band potentials (V fb ) can be determined from the x intercept of the linear region, where the units are V vs. Ag/AgCl.Based on equation E (RHE, reversible hydrogen electrode) 14 E(Ag/AgCl) 0.059 A pH 0.195 V 54, V fb was converted into the RHE potential.The pH of the electrolyte was measured as 6.8 at room temperature.In general, V fb is close to the bottom of the conduction band (E CB ) of n-type semiconductors, which is just 0e0.2 V vs. RHE more negative than V fb 54.The band structures of the catalysts are summarized in Table S1.The E CB values decrease with increasing Cr doping; furthermore, among the 10CCE-Uy1 series catalysts, 10CCE-U31 exhibits the lowest E CB value.Commonly, a negative E CB value is attributed to a stronger reducing capacity for the catalysis.Moreover, the catalysts possess the reduction potential to convert CO 2 into CH 4 or CH 3 OH, according to Eqns. ( 1) and (2). An increased photocurrent density under visible light and a smaller diameter semicircular Nyquist curve observed in the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements can be associated with the separation of holes and photoinduced electrons 55, e.g., a low charge transfer resistance, and high separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs 56.As shown in Fig. 7C, the trend in the decrease in the radius is not linearly related to an increase in the Cr doping amount.This indicates the separation of photoinduced electrons and holes is also affected by the amount of urea added.A similar phenomenon was obtained in the photocurrent test in Fig. 7D; 10CCE-U31 shows the largest stable photocurrent density during on-off cycles of intermittent visible light irradiation compared with other catalysts.The photocatalytic performance of 10CCE-U31 was first investigated by the photodegradation of RhB, as shown in Fig. 8A.The fresh RhB solution without catalysts displays a main absorption peak at 554 nm, and the degradation efficiency over 10CCE-U31 increases as time progresses.A photo of the degradation results is shown in the inset in Fig. 8A.The photodegradation performance as a function of time over the catalysts is shown in Fig. 8B.The sequence of the degradation efficiency is in accordance with the EIS and photocurrent test results, and it is similar to the sequence of the BET surface area.This indicates that the separation efficiency of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs plays a key role in the photodegradation of RhB, although the BET surface area also plays an important role.The photocatalytic performance over the catalysts was also tested by the photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O, as shown in Fig. 8C.CH 4 was generated over all catalysts, but CH 3 OH formed only over the 10CCE-Uy1 series catalysts.Combined with the results of Eqns.( 1) and (2), whether CH 4 or CH 3 OH could be generated over the catalysts was theoretically confirmed.Because the kinetic diameter of CH 3 OH is greater than that of CH 4 , the interaction between CO 2 and H 2 O occurred inside the microsphere with a hollow structure and the generated CH 3 OH was blocked by the shell.Doping with Cr could expand the CeO 2 lattice parameter; however, the catalysts with low Cr doping could not sufficiently expand the lattice to allow for CH 3 OH to pass through.Hence, high Cr doping was necessary for the generation of CH 3 OH.The trend of the generated CH 4 over the 10CCE-Uy1 series catalysts was in accordance with that of the generated CH 3 OH, confirming the above deduction.A graphic illustration is shown in Scheme 2. In addition, the sequence of the photoreduction activity is also in accordance with the EIS and photocurrent test results, confirming the key role of the separation efficiency of photogenerated electron-hole pairs during the photocatalytic test.The CH 4 and CH 3 OH photocatalytic selectivity over the 10CCE-Uy1 series catalysts is shown in Fig. 8D.10CCE-U31 and 10CCE-U41 both exhibit a relatively high CH 3 OH selectivity, indicating that the appropriate amount of added urea benefits the formation of CH 3 OH.In addition, the undiscovered generation of CO occurred because the E CB of most samples was more positive than the reduction potential of CO 2 to CO, based on Eqn.(3).Table S1 shows that 10CCE-U31 and 10CCE-U21 possessed the potential to reduce CO 2 to CO, but their conduction bands were both very close to the reduction potential; thus, they could not reduce CO 2 to CO, which may be caused by overpotential.The possible product of H 2 could not be detected because H 2 was applied as the carrier gas for FID detection. Samples without the addition of urea were also prepared and evaluated with CO 2 RR for comparison and are displayed in Fig. S11.Three samples were named 3CCE, 5CCE and 10CCE, corresponding to the 3, 5 and 10 Cr in mass ratio to CeO 2 , respectively.The results showed that the CH 4 and CH 3 OH yield amounts gradually increased with increasing Cr doping, exhibiting the same tendency as the urea-containing samples.This phenomenon confirmed that Cr doping could promote the generation of CH 4 and CH 3 OH.However, compared with the urea-containing samples, CH 3 OH was formed over the 5CCE sample, whereas no CH 3 OH was found over 5CCE-U31.This occurred because the hollow structure was not formed in 5CCE and the generated CH 3 OH could not be blocked as in the hollow-structured 5CCE-U31 sample; thus, CH 3 OH could be still generated on the surface.Moreover, the appropriate addition of urea enhanced the generation of CH 4 and CH 3 OH, attributed to the formation of a hollow structure with high Cr doping."}, {"llm generation": "Visible", "source": "An increased photocurrent density under visible light and a smaller diameter semicircular Nyquist curve observed in the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements can be associated with the separation of holes and photoinduced electrons 55, e.g., a low charge transfer resistance, and high separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs 56.", "context": "Compared with the conventional syntheses of hollow-type CeO 2 structures, which require complicated, time-consuming, expensive templates 17, a one-pot technique for synthesizing CeO 2 hollow microspheres (adopting urea as a cheap template) is much more convenient.The synthesis process of CreCe mixed oxides with a double-shelled hollow morphology is illustrated in Fig. 1A.The addition of urea has a surprising influence on the hollow structure 28.The synthesized 10CCE-U31 hollow microspheres display a double-shelled structure in which four cores are located within the second shell.The effects of urea on the physical structure of the sample are shown in Fig. 1B, andC.Both 10CCE-U31 and 10CCE exhibit four main peaks corresponding to the CeO 2 cubic structure (JCPDS No. 34e0394) 33.Two catalysts display similar patterns, indicating that the addition of urea did not influence the formation of crystal structures.Additionally, compared with pure CeO 2 , the XRD peaks of both catalysts shift to higher angles.Because the radius of Cr 3 (r Cr 3 14 0.0615 nm) is smaller than that of Ce 4 (r Ce 4 14 0.097 nm), we conclude that the Cr was doped into the CeO 2 lattice.As listed in Table 1, 10CCE-U31 exhibits a higher BET surface area than 10CCE.In addition, the N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of both catalysts are different; 10CCE displays a type III isotherm with a type H3 hysteresis loop, whereas 10CCE-U31 displays a type IV isotherm with a type H4 hysteresis loop 34,35, as shown in Fig. S1.The SEM images reveal the differences in the BET surface areas of the two catalysts; the BET surface area of 10CCE is mainly generated by the aggregates of small nanospheres, whereas the BET surface area of 10CCE-U31 results from its hollow structure, thus the average pore size of 10CCE is higher than that of 10CCE-U31, as shown in Table 1.The above results indicate that the addition of urea mainly influenced the morphologies of CreCe mixed oxides rather than the crystal structure. The varying Cr content in CeO 2 was investigated to study its impacts on the structure of the mixed metal oxides.As shown in Fig. 2, with an increasing content of the Cr-containing precursor, obvious angle shifts appear for the 5CCE-U31, 7CCE-U31 and 10CCE-U31 samples in their XRD patterns.Moreover, there is no CrO x peak among the catalyst peaks, which indicates that all Cr atoms were doped into the CeO 2 lattice.The N 2 adsorptiondesorption isotherms of the catalysts with different Cr doping amounts are shown in Fig. S2A.The catalysts all exhibit type IV isotherms with type H4 hysteresis loops, indicating the existence of a narrow stenopaic pore structure 35.The BET results are illustrated in Table 1, displaying that the surface area, pore volume and pore size increased as the Cr doping increased.These findings indicate that the addition of Cr atoms in conjunction with Ce atoms was beneficial for the generation of pores during the hydrothermal process, confirming the results of a previous study 36.Additionally, the increase in Cr doping could enlarge the pore size.SEM images of the xCCE-U31 series catalysts are shown in Fig. 3A.The varying Cr doping did not obviously influence the morphologies of the catalysts.However, all catalysts display the obvious doubleshelled shape in the TEM images (Fig. 3B).The number of particles attached to the outmost shell increased as the Cr doping increased, which is attributed to the expansile pore structure caused by Cr doping.Combined with the BET results, the generated pores on the shell could facilitate the transport of reactants and increase the number of the exposed active sites, thereby promoting the catalytic performance. The surface element valence state over the catalysts with varying Cr doping was analyzed by XPS characterization, as shown in Fig. 4. The survey spectra confirm the survival of Ce, Cr, and O in the catalysts.In the 2p3/2 region of the Cr 2p spectra, all catalysts are fitted into Cr 3 and Cr 6 states, which are assigned to the Cr 2 O 3 species and CrO 3 species, respectively.The peak with the highest binding energy is attributed to the Cr 6 species and the other peaks correspond to the Cr 3 species 37.The 3d spectrum of Ce is fitted into eight peaks in several different regions (3d5/2: v series, 3d3/2: u series) via Gaussian fitting, in which the peaks labeled v, v'', v''' and u, u'', u''' are assigned to the Ce 4 state and the v' and u' peaks are attributed to the Ce 3 state 38.Two main peaks can be separated after fitting for the O 1s spectra: one peak is denoted O a , corresponding to the lattice oxygen (O 2A ) at a lower binding energy, and the other is denoted O b , corresponding to the chemisorbed oxygen, such as O 2 A or O A at a higher binding energy 39.From the Cr 2p spectrum, the peak intensities and ratios of Cr 6 to Cr 3 increase with an increase in the Cr doping.The influence of different urea dosages on the physicochemical structure of the catalysts was also investigated, as shown in Fig. S2B and Fig. S4.The catalysts with different urea dosages display similar XRD patterns; they all shift to higher angles than that of pure CeO 2 .Additionally, an obvious impurity phase appears over the catalysts with a greater addition of urea.These series catalysts also exhibit a similar N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherm type, and 10CCE-U31 possesses the highest surface area and pore volume.The SEM images confirm the XRD results, displaying a similar morphology with a double-shelled hollow structure under different urea dosages.The surface element valence states over three typical catalysts 10CCE-Uy1 (y 14 1, 3, 5) were characterized via XPS, as shown in Fig. S5.The peak fitting processes of Cr 2p, Ce 3d and O 1s over the catalysts with different urea dosages are the same as those in the above XPS analysis.However, the fitting results, such as the Cr The particle sizes are concentrated over 1.5 mm, and the average particle size is 2.25 mm. A typical TEM image of 10CCE-U31 is displayed in Fig. 5A, which clearly confirms its double-shelled hollow structure.As exhibited in the HRTEM image (Fig. 5B), 10CCE-U31 nanocrystal subunits in the shell with an interplanar spacing of 0.321 nm matches the (1 1 1) crystallographic plane of cubic CeO 2 .The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) image (Fig. 5C) of 10CCE-U31 displays four main continuous rings corresponding to the (1 1 1), (2 0 0), (2 2 0) and (3 1 1) planes of CeO 2 in accordance with the XRD analysis.The uniform distribution of each element in every shell and the cores of the CreCe mixed oxide hollow microspheres investigated by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) element mapping is shown in Fig. 5D. The formation mechanism of the double-shelled hollow structure was discussed and confirmed by characterizations.SEM and TEM images of the uncalcinated 10CCE-U31 sample are shown in Fig. S7, and the results show that, before calcination, a singleshelled hollow sample was formed during the hydrothermal process.The XRD pattern and EDX element mapping of the uncalcinated sample were determined, as shown in Fig. S8.The XRD results show that the uncalcinated sample is similar to the calcined catalyst, and the EDX mapping results show that the Cr, Ce and O The BET surface area and pore structure of the xCCE-Uy1 series catalysts. BET surface area (m 2 /g) Pore volume (mm elements are well dispersed in the hollow microsphere.These results indicate that the structure of CeO 2 was formed during the hydrothermal process, and Cr was doped into CeO 2 lattice uniformly.Combined with the TEM images of the calcined sample, it could be concluded that a primary core-shell structure was generated after hydrothermal treatment, and the calcination process was the key step in forming the double-shelled hollow structure. As shown in Fig. 6A, H 2 -TPR was used to characterize the active sites on the surfaces of the catalysts.Several reduction peaks are found over all catalysts at the range of 100e600 C. The reduction of surface ceria oxide appears in the low-temperature region (I, 260e400 C) and the reduction of Cr 6 (Cr 6 to Cr 3 ) appears in the high-temperature region (II, 410e570 C) 40,41.The catalysts with high Cr doping display high reduction peaks in areas I and II, and 10CCE-U31 exhibits the highest reduction.The results indicate that an increase in the Cr doping could benefit the interactions between Cr and Ce species, thereby generating additional active sites.The appropriate addition of urea could further enhance these interactions.The TPR results are consistent with the XPS analysis.For the gas-phase reaction, the reactant adsorption capacity of the catalysts plays an important role.The NO and O 2 adsorption properties of all catalysts were tested by TPD experiments, as shown in Fig. 6B andC.From the NO-TPD profiles, two desorption peak regions are derived: the peak in the low-temperature area (a peak) is attributed to the monodentate nitrate and bridged nitrate, and others at high temperature (b peak) can be assigned to the bridged nitrate and bidentate nitrate 42.The catalysts with higher Cr doping display low a peak temperatures, indicating that these catalysts possess high NO adsorption capacities at low temperatures.Among the catalysts, 10CCE-U31 exhibits the highest a peak area, which might be due to its high Cr 6 content.In the O 2 -TPD results, three oxygen species are obtained in three separate temperature regions.The peak lower than 400 C (d peak) is caused by a kind of physically and weakly chemically adsorbed oxygen, and the peak higher than 550 C (g peak) is attributed to the oxygen in the lattice.The peak between the d peak and peak is derived from the oxygen defects ( peak), generally existing in the form of chemisorbed oxygen such as O A and O 2 A 43.The results show that 10CCE-U31 possesses the highest d peak and peak areas, indicating the abundance of chemisorbed oxygen on the surface in accordance with the XPS results.NO oxidation was carried out over all catalysts in the temperature range of 150e400 C to test the oxidizability, as shown in Fig. 6D.The catalytic activity over all catalysts first increases and then decreases with increasing temperature.The decrease in the oxidation activity at higher temperature is attributed to the limitation of thermodynamic equilibrium 44.Moreover, the oxidation efficiency increases with increased Cr doping, especially in the low-temperature region (150e200 C). Based on the oxidation performance, there is an optimum addition of urea that is three times the total metallic element content in the mole ratio.The NO oxidation results match the abovementioned XPS, TPR and TPD results.Among the catalysts, 10CCE-U31 exhibits the highest NO oxidation performance in the tested temperature region, and its highest oxidation activity is 83.3 at 300 C. Notably, 10CCE-U31 also displays excellent low-temperature activity.The efficiency reaches 42.8 at 150 C and 59.9 at 200 C, and the temperature point for an NO oxidation efficiency of 50 is 170 C; thus, 10CCE-U31 can satisfy the changes in the oxidation process after the desulfurization system to a certain degree.Moreover, the oxidation activities over most samples are in accordance with the thermodynamic equilibrium, excluding 10CCE-U21, 10CCE-U31, 10CCE-U41 and 10CCE-U51 at high temperature over 300 C, which all have 10 Cr doping.This phenomenon is attributed to the high oxidation efficiency caused by Cr active species, which was confirmed in our previous work 45.In addition, the stability of the optimized catalyst 10CCE-U31 was tested.As shown in Fig. S9, 10CCE-U31 displays stable NO oxidation efficiency under 300 C.Moreover, three \"cooling and heating\" cycling tests also confirmed the excellent stability of 10CCE-U31. To investigate the NO oxidation at lower temperatures, 10CCE-U31 was exposed to a gas mixture of 1000 ppm NO and 8 vol O 2 , and the temperature was increased to 250 C at an interval of 50 C in the in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) technique system.The spectrum was collected at 5 min and 30 min for each temperature, as shown in Fig. S10.Four typical bands were detected.First, the band at 1258 cm A1 can be attributed as bridged nitrate 46, and the band at 1043 cm A1 is assigned to monodentate nitrate 47.The band at 1353 cm A1 is attributed to the adsorbed NO 3 A , which can be formed by the interaction between chemisorbed NO and O 2 A 48.The band at 1400 cm A1 is assigned to the intermediate NO 49.The intensity of the bridged nitrate decreases with increasing temperature, and the intensities of the other three bands begin to increase at the same time.Among these bands, an intensity increase of the monodentate nitrate and adsorbed NO 3 A appears when the temperature increases to 200 C, and an intensity increase of intermediate NO appears at 250 C.These results confirm that the 10CCE-U31 catalyst possesses catalytic oxidation ability at low temperatures.We propose a NO oxidation mechanism over 10CCE-U31 based on the above analysis, as shown in Scheme 1.The adsorbed NO 3 A can react with the intermediate NO to generate two NO 2 molecules.The surface electronic states and the band gap were obtained via UVevis DRS measurements, as shown in Fig. 7A.Two typical absorption bands centered at 270 nm and 360 nm can be found in all the catalysts.These two bands are caused by Ce 4 ) O 2A charge transfer (270 nm) and interband (360 nm) transitions 50,51.No clear absorption band corresponding to the Ce 3 ) O 2A charge transfer transition is observed, which generally appeared at 255 nm 52.In addition, the bands attributed to Cr 3 and Cr 2 O 3 are usually centered at 460 nm and 590 nm, respectively 53, but they were not found over all catalysts.These results confirm that there are few CrO x species on the surface and that Cr is doped into the CeO 2 lattice.Based on the adsorption band edge, the band gap (Eg) of each catalyst was calculated, as shown in the inset in Fig. 7A.The band gap decreases with increasing Cr doping and the 10CCE-Uy1 series catalysts display similar Eg values, indicating that the different quantities of added urea exhibit little influence on the band gaps.The band gaps of the catalysts are listed in Table S1.As shown in Fig. 7B, we used Mott-Schottky measurements to clarify the band structures of the catalysts.For n-type semiconductors, reversed sigmoidal plots are realized with an overall shape consistent with that type.The flat band potentials (V fb ) can be determined from the x intercept of the linear region, where the units are V vs. Ag/AgCl.Based on equation E (RHE, reversible hydrogen electrode) 14 E(Ag/AgCl) 0.059 A pH 0.195 V 54, V fb was converted into the RHE potential.The pH of the electrolyte was measured as 6.8 at room temperature.In general, V fb is close to the bottom of the conduction band (E CB ) of n-type semiconductors, which is just 0e0.2 V vs. RHE more negative than V fb 54.The band structures of the catalysts are summarized in Table S1.The E CB values decrease with increasing Cr doping; furthermore, among the 10CCE-Uy1 series catalysts, 10CCE-U31 exhibits the lowest E CB value.Commonly, a negative E CB value is attributed to a stronger reducing capacity for the catalysis.Moreover, the catalysts possess the reduction potential to convert CO 2 into CH 4 or CH 3 OH, according to Eqns. ( 1) and (2). An increased photocurrent density under visible light and a smaller diameter semicircular Nyquist curve observed in the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements can be associated with the separation of holes and photoinduced electrons 55, e.g., a low charge transfer resistance, and high separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs 56.As shown in Fig. 7C, the trend in the decrease in the radius is not linearly related to an increase in the Cr doping amount.This indicates the separation of photoinduced electrons and holes is also affected by the amount of urea added.A similar phenomenon was obtained in the photocurrent test in Fig. 7D; 10CCE-U31 shows the largest stable photocurrent density during on-off cycles of intermittent visible light irradiation compared with other catalysts.The photocatalytic performance of 10CCE-U31 was first investigated by the photodegradation of RhB, as shown in Fig. 8A.The fresh RhB solution without catalysts displays a main absorption peak at 554 nm, and the degradation efficiency over 10CCE-U31 increases as time progresses.A photo of the degradation results is shown in the inset in Fig. 8A.The photodegradation performance as a function of time over the catalysts is shown in Fig. 8B.The sequence of the degradation efficiency is in accordance with the EIS and photocurrent test results, and it is similar to the sequence of the BET surface area.This indicates that the separation efficiency of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs plays a key role in the photodegradation of RhB, although the BET surface area also plays an important role.The photocatalytic performance over the catalysts was also tested by the photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O, as shown in Fig. 8C.CH 4 was generated over all catalysts, but CH 3 OH formed only over the 10CCE-Uy1 series catalysts.Combined with the results of Eqns.( 1) and (2), whether CH 4 or CH 3 OH could be generated over the catalysts was theoretically confirmed.Because the kinetic diameter of CH 3 OH is greater than that of CH 4 , the interaction between CO 2 and H 2 O occurred inside the microsphere with a hollow structure and the generated CH 3 OH was blocked by the shell.Doping with Cr could expand the CeO 2 lattice parameter; however, the catalysts with low Cr doping could not sufficiently expand the lattice to allow for CH 3 OH to pass through.Hence, high Cr doping was necessary for the generation of CH 3 OH.The trend of the generated CH 4 over the 10CCE-Uy1 series catalysts was in accordance with that of the generated CH 3 OH, confirming the above deduction.A graphic illustration is shown in Scheme 2. In addition, the sequence of the photoreduction activity is also in accordance with the EIS and photocurrent test results, confirming the key role of the separation efficiency of photogenerated electron-hole pairs during the photocatalytic test.The CH 4 and CH 3 OH photocatalytic selectivity over the 10CCE-Uy1 series catalysts is shown in Fig. 8D.10CCE-U31 and 10CCE-U41 both exhibit a relatively high CH 3 OH selectivity, indicating that the appropriate amount of added urea benefits the formation of CH 3 OH.In addition, the undiscovered generation of CO occurred because the E CB of most samples was more positive than the reduction potential of CO 2 to CO, based on Eqn.(3).Table S1 shows that 10CCE-U31 and 10CCE-U21 possessed the potential to reduce CO 2 to CO, but their conduction bands were both very close to the reduction potential; thus, they could not reduce CO 2 to CO, which may be caused by overpotential.The possible product of H 2 could not be detected because H 2 was applied as the carrier gas for FID detection. Samples without the addition of urea were also prepared and evaluated with CO 2 RR for comparison and are displayed in Fig. S11.Three samples were named 3CCE, 5CCE and 10CCE, corresponding to the 3, 5 and 10 Cr in mass ratio to CeO 2 , respectively.The results showed that the CH 4 and CH 3 OH yield amounts gradually increased with increasing Cr doping, exhibiting the same tendency as the urea-containing samples.This phenomenon confirmed that Cr doping could promote the generation of CH 4 and CH 3 OH.However, compared with the urea-containing samples, CH 3 OH was formed over the 5CCE sample, whereas no CH 3 OH was found over 5CCE-U31.This occurred because the hollow structure was not formed in 5CCE and the generated CH 3 OH could not be blocked as in the hollow-structured 5CCE-U31 sample; thus, CH 3 OH could be still generated on the surface.Moreover, the appropriate addition of urea enhanced the generation of CH 4 and CH 3 OH, attributed to the formation of a hollow structure with high Cr doping."}], "lamp": [{"llm generation": "Xenon", "source": "Then, a 300 W Xe lamp (CEL-HXF300, Beijing CEAulight Co., Ltd., China) with a UV-light cut-off filter (l 420 nm) as the light source irradiated the sapphire at the top of the reactor.", "context": "Details on the preparation are presented in Note 1 in the supporting information.The synthesized samples were denoted as xCCE-Uy1, where x and y represent the Cr doping amount and the mole ratio of urea, respectively.Catalysts without Cr doping or urea were also prepared for comparison and were labeled CE-U31 or 10CCE, respectively.
