The porous C 3 N 4 structure with a hollow interior replicates the precise nature of the SiO 2 templates after etching out as shown in Fig. 2a-d.The diameter of the interior hollows ranges ca.50-80 nm with irregular intervals in the C 3 N 4 framework on the surface of the sample.The porosity of the HC-C 3 N 4 texture framework is further supported by the TEM analysis Fig. 2e-f.The TEM characterization further shows the existence of interior hollow or pores introduced alongside with the considerable number of surface defects. The EDX elemental mapping images (Fig. 3) show a uniform allocation of both carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) as the only components within the HC-C 3 N 4 sample, without any other elements such as silica or oxygen.The elemental study shows that the HC-C 3 N 4 has a C/N molar ratio of 0.72, while the bulk C 3 N 4 shows 0.70.The respective stoichiometric C: N ratio is C 3.2 :N 4.4 and C 2.9 :N 4.1 for HC-C 3 N 4 and bulk C 3 N 4 , respectively.These results are nearby to the hypothetical value of 0.75 for ideal g-C 3 N 4 , suggesting some incomplete condensation which is normally examined in the preparation of g-C 3 N 4 (Kailasam et al. 2011;Li et al. 2012). The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the HC-C 3 N 4 sample was conducted to determine the thermal stability, decomposition behavior, and final carbon nitride content (i.e., purity).The HC-C 3 N 4 and bulk C 3 N 4 samples were warmed from ambient temperature to 900 C at a heating rate of 10 C min -1 under air, and the subsequent outcome is shown in Fig. 4. A complete weight loss takes place in both samples beyond 700 C after experiencing two stages of significant weight.The first stage occurred at 400 C with 6.7 and 5.5 wt losses for HC-C 3 N 4 and bulk C 3 N 4 , respectively, was caused by thermal removal of hydroxyl groups or bound water particles and other absorbed unstable contaminations on the facade of the samples.The second stage witnessed rapid and significant weight loss from 450 to 620 C corresponding to 91.7 wt loss for the HC-C 3 N 4 .The bulk-C 3 N 4 completely decomposes at 670 C, which corresponds to 94.1 wt.This reaction is generated from the decomposition of C-N bondrelated frameworks in the carbon nitride polymer and their sublimation into g-C 3 N 4 gaseous products.It can be observed from the TG curves that the decomposition behavior of the HC-C 3 N 4 occurred at a lower temperature relative to the bulk C 3 N 4 .This is due to the formation of hollows or pores within the C 3 N 4 matrix, which increases the mesoporosity and surface area of the HC-C 3 N 4 sample.These results make the HC-C 3 N 4 sample less heavy and lead to easily decomposed at lower temperatures. The Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) test was further conducted to disclose the microstructure of the HC-C 3 N 4 asprepared sample.There are similarities in the spectra characteristics of both HC-C 3 N 4 and bulk C 3 N 4 as-prepared samples as shown in Fig. 5.This signifies the excellent maintenance of both the heptazine (or s-triazine) band and trigonal C-N(-C)-C/bridging C-NH-C components in the samples.The sharp peak at around 811 cm -1 fits into the breathing mode of the heptazine or s-triazine band.The firm peaks at 1215-1640 cm -1 are ascribed to the elongation or bending vibration of the aromatic carbon and nitrogen heterocycles (i.e., C-N and/or CN bonds).Besides, the extensive characteristic band in a range of 3105-3700 cm -1 is attributed to the stretching vibrations of residual N-H bonds in the primary and secondary amines (NH or -NH 2 ) groups and adsorbed water molecules (Zheng et al. 2014;Kang et al. 2015).All these observations suggest that the HC-C 3 N 4 prepared is similar to the reference bulk C 3 N 4 with some NH or -NH 2 groups in the samples, an indication of incomplete condensation.It further shows that all the SiO 2 templates were etched out and the strong etching reagent (NH 4 HF 2 ) does not have any effect on the robust structure of the HC-C 3 N 4 synthesized. Figure 6 shows the N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms and the corresponding pore size allocation curves of the asprepared samples.The entire samples exhibited type IV isotherms, suggesting the existence of mesopores inside the samples (Sing 1985).The profile of the hysteresis loops is of type H3, signifying the presence of slit-like mesopores owing to the accumulation of plate-like grains.Furthermore, it can be seen that the isotherms exhibited a high relative pressure range (approaching 1.0), signifying the arrangement of large mesopores and macropores.The pore size allocation curves ranged from 2 to 120 nm (inset in Fig. 6) further confirmed the mesoporosity of the samples.The HC-C 3 N 4 sample exhibited only the existence of large mesopores at a peak pore size of 42 nm and macropores at 75 nm.This was due to the successful creation of large interior hollows or cylindrical channels within the C 3 N 4 matrix of HC-C 3 N 4 samples, after the exclusion of the silica templates which is evidenced by the FESEM and TEM images.However, small mesopores (3.5-4.5 nm), huge mesopores, and macropores (42-75 nm) can be examined in the bulk sample.The BET values for the as-prepared samples are shown in Table 1.It can be seen that the HC-C 3 N 4 sample has a significantly higher surface area and pore volume (2.5 times higher) than the bulk C 3 N 4 .This can be ascribed to the creation of a huge amount of macropores within the C 3 N 4 matrix.This results would lead to effective surface absorption of reactants and faster photogenerated carrier separation and thus enhancement in photocatalytic activity.The reduction in the BET values in the HC-C 3 N 4 /Ni(OH) 2 sample can be attributed to the evidence of the Ni(OH) 2 cocatalyst which may be ingrained in the C 3 N 4 pores and thus decreasing the BET surface area and pore volume. The chemical distribution and elemental status of HC-C 3 N 4 and bulk C 3 N 4 were distinguished by XPS analysis, and the outcome is illustrated in Fig. 7a.The survey spectra of both samples show only C, N, and O elements.There was no signal detection of silicon species which confirms the successful removal of the SiO 2 templates used in the preparation of the HC-C 3 N 4 .However, the presence of the O1s peak could be attributed to exterior preoccupied water molecules as definite by the FT-IR results (Fig. 5). Figure 7b shows that C1s peak deconvoluted into three peaks.The peak at 286.4 and 288.0 eV binding energies are attributed to sp 2 C-C bonds and sp 2 -hybridized carbon in nitrogen-incorporated aromatic ring (N-CN), respectively.However, the peak at binding energy (284.exterior extrinsic carbon, derived from the sample and the XPS instrument itself (Yang et al. 2015;Zheng et al. 2014).The high-resolution XPS spectra of N 1s were indexed into four peaks at binding energies 398.4,399.0, 400.3, and 404.2 eV, respectively, as shown in Fig. 7c.The highest peak at 398.4 eV binding energies is ascribed to sp 2 -hybridized aromatic nitrogen bonding in the triazine rings with two carbon atoms (C-NC).The peak at 400.3 eV correlates to the tertiary nitrogen N-(C)3 groups.Both peaks jointly with sp 2hybridized carbon (N-CN, at 288.0 eV) conform to heptazine heterocyclic ring units which are the essential building substructure for g-C 3 N 4 .The weak peak at 400.3 eV can be allocated to N-H bonds which indicate the presence of amino functional groups due to the deficient concentration of poly (tri-s-triazine) structures (Gu et al. 2015;Qin et al. 2015).The weakest peak at binding energy (404.2eV) can be credited to -excitations or positive charge localization in the heterocycles (Li et al. 2015a, b, c, d;Yu et al. 2014a, b). Figure 8a shows the optical properties of HC-C 3 N 4 and bulk C 3 N 4 samples which exhibited similarities in their absorption spectra.From the spectra, it could be observed that all the samples show light absorption from the UV region to the visible range up to 700 nm.However, the HC-C 3 N 4 samples show slight changes in the absorption and bandgap energy owing to the introduction of pores in the structure.This porous structure has enhanced the light-harvesting ability of the HC-C 3 N 4 samples in the whole optical spectrum showing a slight improvement in absorption especially from a wavelength of 425 nm owing to the numerous reflections of incident light within the hollows or pores in the C 3 N 4 structure (Kailasam et al. 2011;Zheng et al. 2014).Furthermore, a minor blue shift in the absorption edge at ca. 465 nm in the bulk C 3 N 4 is shifted to 450 nm for the HC-C 3 N 4 , implies that the bandgap energy is improved from 2.66 to 2.75 eV (Fig. 8b).This result suggests the existence of a quantum confinement effect in the HC-C 3 N 4 due to incomplete condensation (Kang et al. 2015).Besides, the as-prepared HC-C 3 N 4 samples also exhibited deeper brownish yellow color than the bulk C 3 N 4 which is shown as an inset in Fig. 8a.This color variation could also be attributed to the incomplete condensation process with excess carbon in the sample as estimated in the C:N molar ratio in the EDX elemental analysis.Another important parameter used in estimating the efficiency of photocatalytic activity is photoluminescence (PL) spectra.The PL emission spectra resulted from the resequencing rate of photogenerated electrons and hole pairs (Yu et al. 2014a, b).So, the PL method is used to measure the charge carrier's dissolution or recombination rates of the photocatalysts.Generally, the stronger the PL peak intensity, the superior the re-sequencing ability of the photoexcited electron-hole pairs and thus the lower the photocatalytic activity of the photocatalyst (Yu et al. 2003).Figure 9 shows one broad PL peak around ca. 451 and 463 nm for HC-C 3 N 4 and bulk C 3 N 4 samples, respectively.This is due to the band-band PL occurrence and very close to their respective bandgap energies (Zheng et al. 2014).It can be noticed that the HC-C 3 N 4 samples have decreased PL intensities and stronger PL quenching relative to the bulk C 3 N 4 samples.This suggests effective suppression in the re-sequencing rate of photoexcited charge transfer and hence efficient charge separation in the HC-C 3 N 4 samples which would favor higher photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity. Besides, to probe the charge transfer process in the asprepared samples, a time-resolved PL fluorescence decay study was carried out.According to the fluorescence lifetime decay curves and fitted parameters (Fig. 10 a andb), the short lifetime or fast component that is owing to the decomposition from free exciton states decreased from 2.6940 for the bulk C 3 N 4 down to 2.4488 ns for the HC-C 3 N 4 .Also, the long lifetime or marginal sluggish component which emerged from the bound exciton states decreases from 12.5566 for the bulk C 3 N 4 to 12.2361 ns for the HC-C 3 N 4 .The above result shows that fluorescence lifetimes are much reduced after the addition of hollows or pores in the C 3 N 4 matrix.The reduce of the emission strength and its lifetime signify to the reduction of a fraction of HC-C 3 N 4 excitons (or excited states) arise through a non-radiative pathway, probably by charge relocation of electron and hole pairs with high mobility to fresh restricted/surface states which were created in the honeycomb structure of the C 3 N 4 (Gao et al. 2013;Shalom et al. 2014;Jiang et al. 2016). To further have an in-depth understanding and more information about the charge carriers and photoelectrochemical properties of the as-prepared samples, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) examination was carried out.Figure 11 shows the Nyquist plots which indicated that the as-prepared HC-C 3 N 4 samples exhibited significantly lower semicircle arc compared with other samples.This suggests inhibition in the rearrangement of photogenerated electrons and holes and hence higher migration of charge carriers.However, the large semicircle arc observed in the bulk C 3 N 4 can be ascribed to faster rearrangement of photogenerated electrons and holes pairs. Consecutively, to ensure that the as-prepared HC-C 3 N 4 is suitable for photoreduction of CO 2 reduction under visible Fig. 9 PL spectra of as-prepared samples light, the band energy level structure was examined by the Mott-Schottky analysis.The flat band potential (E FB ) measurements were performed using the electrochemical technique to approximately estimate the conduction band edge potentials (E CB ). Figure 12a shows the Mott-Schottky plots of the HC-C 3 N 4 and bulk C 3 N 4 samples, which exhibited ntype characteristic semiconductor features with positive slopes.This suggests that electrons serve as majority charge carriers (Zhan et al. 2015).Depending on the Mott-Schottky plots, the conduction band potentials (E CB ) of HC-C 3 N 4 and bulk C 3 N 4 were derived to be -1.51V and -1.20 V, respectively.The bandgap energies (E g ) were obtained using the Tauc plots of the Kubelka-Munk function (Fig. 8b), and the valence band potentials (E VB ) were calculated from the formula E CB E VB -E g to be 1.24 and 1.46 V for HC-C 3 N 4 and bulk C 3 N 4 , respectively.Figure 12b proves the schematic design of the alignment of band energy levels which indicated that both HC-C 3 N 4 and bulk C 3 N 4 samples thermodynamically satisfy the condition for CO 2 photocatalytic reduction.Further from Fig. 12b, it could be observed that CB of the HC-C 3 N 4 changes to the more negative potential location, while the VB edge shifts to less positive value relative to the bulk C 3 N 4 sample.Generally, it has been established that the more negative CB value, the more decreases photoexcited electrons are produced and transferred to reactants, alongside lesser recombination rate due to rapid charge carrier transportability (Liu et al. 2010).Based on this, under visible light irradiation, the HC-C 3 N 4 sample has a more excellent electronic band structure and the photocatalytic reductive ability for reactants than the bulk C 3 N 4 .Upon loading Ni(OH) 2 cocatalyst through the intimate contact between HC-C 3 N 4 and Ni(OH) 2 , achieve improved visible light CO 2 reduction, the photoexcited electrons would effectively migrate from the HC-C 3 N 4 to the Ni(OH) 2 , to produce CH 4 and CH 3 OH via photocatalytic reaction, where Ni(OH) 2 acts as an electron receiver which significantly enhanced CO 2 reduction activity over the composited HC-C 3 N 4 /Ni(OH) 2 photocatalyst. The complete photocatalytic CO 2 reduction movement over the catalyst can be compiled as follows: The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity of the HC-C 3 N 4 and bulk C 3 N 4 samples was calculated under simulated visible light irradiation ( 400 nm), and the representative authentic chromatogram is shown in Fig. 13a.The products detected under photoactivity are shown in Fig. 13b.The tests were carried out fewer than two distinct controlled conditions.In the first, experiments were conducted without visible light irradiation, and in the second, experiments were conducted in the absence of a photocatalyst, which showed no detection of hydrocarbon products.This proposes that a photocatalyst and light irradiation are two important aspects for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 into hydrocarbon products.This further proves that the hydrocarbon products were generated via photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with water vapor over the photocatalyst under visible light irradiation.CH 4 and CH 3 OH continue to be the major hydrocarbon products, and additional noticeable hydrocarbon compounds like HCOOH, C 2 H 5 OH, HCHO, and CO were detected at ambient temperature and pressure condition.As compared with Fig. 13b, the HC-C 3 N 4 sample exhibited high photocatalytic formation of hydrocarbon products (i.e., CH 4 and CH 3 OH) than the bulk C 3 N 4 .Since the chemical content of the HC-C 3 N 4 and bulk C 3 N 4 are the same, the improved photoactivity of the HC-C 3 N 4 may be ascribed to the following factors observed in the structural properties.Firstly, the unique hollow or macropores introduced into the C 3 N 4 matrix result in a large surface area that offers the introduction of additional vigorous catalytic sites and channels for photocatalytic reactions.The hollows in the HC-C 3 N 4 are in addition advantageous for rapid mass diffusion of photogenerated carriers leading to their higher probability of participation in surface redox reactions without recombination.Secondly, the increase mesoporosity in the HC-C 3 N 4 sample has decreased the wall thickness of the C 3 N 4 matrix and increased its visible light absorption ability more.This has lowered its flat potential and higher beneficiary electron density which thermodynamically promotes photocatalytic reaction.Furthermore, the higher degree of electron delocalization in the HC-C 3 N 4 is due to its poor crystallization nature which has contributed to the improvement in charge dissolution efficiency of the generated transporters.To improve the charge separation capability of the HC-C 3 N 4 samples, Ni(OH) 2 was used as a lowcost cocatalyst.It was observed that the HC-C 3 N 4 /Ni(OH) 2 sample has the highest hydrocarbon product formation rate (1.48 molh -1 g -1 of CH 4 generation and 0.73 molh -1 g -1 of CH 3 OH generation).This can be ascribed to efficient interfacial electron mobility starting HC-C 3 N 4 to Ni(OH) 2 nanoparticles and thus prevents rearrangement of photoexcited electron-hole pairs.This led to effective charge dissolution and as a result improved the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity.Further, Table 2 shows the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity of various C 3 N 4 -based photocatalysts.It was found that the HC-C 3 N 4 cocatalyst with Ni(OH) 2 exhibits enhanced or comparable photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activities compared with most of the previously reported C 3 N 4based photocatalysts.Therefore, it could be concluded that doping earth-abundant cocatalyst could substantially enhance CO 2 reduction activity and could be replaced by an expensive noble metal or toxic metal sulfides. Stability is of great importance for determining the practical application performance of a given photocatalyst.The stability of HC-C 3 N 4 /Ni(OH) 2 , the five repetitive runs with each run of 3 h for visible light CO 2 reduction were measured, and the results are shown in Fig. 14a.After each run, the light irradiation was stopped, the reactor was evacuated and then refilled with 0.12 g NaHCO 3 (introduced into the reactor before sealing), and 0.25 mL 4 M HCl solution (introduced into the reactor by a syringe) apart from this no catalyst washing or fresh introduction was performed.Clearly from our results, the methanol and methane production activity remains unchanged for the first and the second runs, and it slightly decreased in the successive run.The above result indicates that the as-prepared HC-C 3 N 4 /Ni(OH) 2 , sample exhibits admirable stability during the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity.Besides, the comparison of the PXRD pattern of HC-C 3 N 4 / Ni(OH) 2 samples before and after the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction is also examined (Fig. 14b).The intensity of diffraction peaks did not showed any significant difference in the PXRD patterns, conforming that the as-prepared HC-C 3 N 4 / Ni(OH) 2 photocatalyst are essentially stable and suitable for CO 2 reduction. Consecutively, to further support the improved photocatalytic performance observed in the HC-C 3 N 4 samples, a photoelectrochemical (PEC) analysis was performed.This was done to explore the photoinduced electron or charge mobility processes in the as-prepared samples cast on FTO glass.Figure 15 illustrates the correlation of I-t curves of fast photocurrent feedback in the electrodes of prepared samples.It can be realized that the photocurrent quickly reduces to the initial state as the light was turned off and proceeds reverse to a stable charge when the light is turned on.This is an indication of the transportation of most photoproduced electrons back to the unity across the sample to generate photocurrent under visible light irradiation.A significantly higher photocurrent was observed in HC-C 3 N 4 as-prepared electrodes especially HC-C 3 N 4 /Ni(OH) 2 compared with the other electrodes.The result suggests that the rearrangement rate of electrons and holes pairs is significantly inhibited, and thus, charge dissolution and transfer efficiency have improved"}, {"llm generation": "Ni(OH)2 nanoparticles", "source": "Further, to confirm the enhanced photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity, Ni(OH) 2 nanoparticles were grown over the honeycomb g-C 3 N 4 structure to provide electron sink and to encourage charge dissolution efficiency.", "context": "Honeycomb-like graphitic carbon nitride (HC-C 3 N 4 ) was fabricated through thermal compression of an as-prepared SiO 2 template and dicyandiamide.The NH 4 HF 2 etching out of the SiO 2 template results in the creation of hollows or macropores in the C 3 N 4 matrix leading to the superior specific surface area.The HC-C 3 N 4 shows only structural changes but not in chemical composition correlated to the bulk C 3 N 4 .Compared with the bulk C 3 N 4 , the HC-C 3 N 4 nanostructure demonstrated a higher photocatalytic CO 2 reduction rate of hydrocarbon formation.The higher photocatalytic activity showed by HC-C 3 N 4 could be credited to the void nature of the structure, higher surface area, excellent visible light absorption ability, higher electron donor density, mass diffusion of materials for surface redox reaction, and effective segregation of photogenerated charge carriers due to the decrease in its wall thickness.Further, to confirm the enhanced photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity, Ni(OH) 2 nanoparticles were grown over the honeycomb g-C 3 N 4 structure to provide electron sink and to encourage charge dissolution efficiency.The asprepared Ni(OH) 2 decorated honeycomb g-C 3 N 4 hybrids displayed an excellent visible light photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to solar fuels with 1.48 molh -1 g -1 of CH 4 and 0.73 molh -1 g -1 of CH 3 OH generation, respectively.This study showed that the morphology tuning of C 3 N 4 can be an excellent strategy of producing low-cost and sustainable photocatalyst for mitigating increase CO 2 levels in the environment into clean solar fuels.

The porous C 3 N 4 structure with a hollow interior replicates the precise nature of the SiO 2 templates after etching out as shown in Fig. 2a-d.The diameter of the interior hollows ranges ca.50-80 nm with irregular intervals in the C 3 N 4 framework on the surface of the sample.The porosity of the HC-C 3 N 4 texture framework is further supported by the TEM analysis Fig. 2e-f.The TEM characterization further shows the existence of interior hollow or pores introduced alongside with the considerable number of surface defects. The EDX elemental mapping images (Fig. 3) show a uniform allocation of both carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) as the only components within the HC-C 3 N 4 sample, without any other elements such as silica or oxygen.The elemental study shows that the HC-C 3 N 4 has a C/N molar ratio of 0.72, while the bulk C 3 N 4 shows 0.70.The respective stoichiometric C: N ratio is C 3.2 :N 4.4 and C 2.9 :N 4.1 for HC-C 3 N 4 and bulk C 3 N 4 , respectively.These results are nearby to the hypothetical value of 0.75 for ideal g-C 3 N 4 , suggesting some incomplete condensation which is normally examined in the preparation of g-C 3 N 4 (Kailasam et al. 2011;Li et al. 2012). The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the HC-C 3 N 4 sample was conducted to determine the thermal stability, decomposition behavior, and final carbon nitride content (i.e., purity).The HC-C 3 N 4 and bulk C 3 N 4 samples were warmed from ambient temperature to 900 C at a heating rate of 10 C min -1 under air, and the subsequent outcome is shown in Fig. 4. A complete weight loss takes place in both samples beyond 700 C after experiencing two stages of significant weight.The first stage occurred at 400 C with 6.7 and 5.5 wt losses for HC-C 3 N 4 and bulk C 3 N 4 , respectively, was caused by thermal removal of hydroxyl groups or bound water particles and other absorbed unstable contaminations on the facade of the samples.The second stage witnessed rapid and significant weight loss from 450 to 620 C corresponding to 91.7 wt loss for the HC-C 3 N 4 .The bulk-C 3 N 4 completely decomposes at 670 C, which corresponds to 94.1 wt.This reaction is generated from the decomposition of C-N bondrelated frameworks in the carbon nitride polymer and their sublimation into g-C 3 N 4 gaseous products.It can be observed from the TG curves that the decomposition behavior of the HC-C 3 N 4 occurred at a lower temperature relative to the bulk C 3 N 4 .This is due to the formation of hollows or pores within the C 3 N 4 matrix, which increases the mesoporosity and surface area of the HC-C 3 N 4 sample.These results make the HC-C 3 N 4 sample less heavy and lead to easily decomposed at lower temperatures. The Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) test was further conducted to disclose the microstructure of the HC-C 3 N 4 asprepared sample.There are similarities in the spectra characteristics of both HC-C 3 N 4 and bulk C 3 N 4 as-prepared samples as shown in Fig. 5.This signifies the excellent maintenance of both the heptazine (or s-triazine) band and trigonal C-N(-C)-C/bridging C-NH-C components in the samples.The sharp peak at around 811 cm -1 fits into the breathing mode of the heptazine or s-triazine band.The firm peaks at 1215-1640 cm -1 are ascribed to the elongation or bending vibration of the aromatic carbon and nitrogen heterocycles (i.e., C-N and/or CN bonds).Besides, the extensive characteristic band in a range of 3105-3700 cm -1 is attributed to the stretching vibrations of residual N-H bonds in the primary and secondary amines (NH or -NH 2 ) groups and adsorbed water molecules (Zheng et al. 2014;Kang et al. 2015).All these observations suggest that the HC-C 3 N 4 prepared is similar to the reference bulk C 3 N 4 with some NH or -NH 2 groups in the samples, an indication of incomplete condensation.It further shows that all the SiO 2 templates were etched out and the strong etching reagent (NH 4 HF 2 ) does not have any effect on the robust structure of the HC-C 3 N 4 synthesized. Figure 6 shows the N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms and the corresponding pore size allocation curves of the asprepared samples.The entire samples exhibited type IV isotherms, suggesting the existence of mesopores inside the samples (Sing 1985).The profile of the hysteresis loops is of type H3, signifying the presence of slit-like mesopores owing to the accumulation of plate-like grains.Furthermore, it can be seen that the isotherms exhibited a high relative pressure range (approaching 1.0), signifying the arrangement of large mesopores and macropores.The pore size allocation curves ranged from 2 to 120 nm (inset in Fig. 6) further confirmed the mesoporosity of the samples.The HC-C 3 N 4 sample exhibited only the existence of large mesopores at a peak pore size of 42 nm and macropores at 75 nm.This was due to the successful creation of large interior hollows or cylindrical channels within the C 3 N 4 matrix of HC-C 3 N 4 samples, after the exclusion of the silica templates which is evidenced by the FESEM and TEM images.However, small mesopores (3.5-4.5 nm), huge mesopores, and macropores (42-75 nm) can be examined in the bulk sample.The BET values for the as-prepared samples are shown in Table 1.It can be seen that the HC-C 3 N 4 sample has a significantly higher surface area and pore volume (2.5 times higher) than the bulk C 3 N 4 .This can be ascribed to the creation of a huge amount of macropores within the C 3 N 4 matrix.This results would lead to effective surface absorption of reactants and faster photogenerated carrier separation and thus enhancement in photocatalytic activity.The reduction in the BET values in the HC-C 3 N 4 /Ni(OH) 2 sample can be attributed to the evidence of the Ni(OH) 2 cocatalyst which may be ingrained in the C 3 N 4 pores and thus decreasing the BET surface area and pore volume. The chemical distribution and elemental status of HC-C 3 N 4 and bulk C 3 N 4 were distinguished by XPS analysis, and the outcome is illustrated in Fig. 7a.The survey spectra of both samples show only C, N, and O elements.There was no signal detection of silicon species which confirms the successful removal of the SiO 2 templates used in the preparation of the HC-C 3 N 4 .However, the presence of the O1s peak could be attributed to exterior preoccupied water molecules as definite by the FT-IR results (Fig. 5). Figure 7b shows that C1s peak deconvoluted into three peaks.The peak at 286.4 and 288.0 eV binding energies are attributed to sp 2 C-C bonds and sp 2 -hybridized carbon in nitrogen-incorporated aromatic ring (N-CN), respectively.However, the peak at binding energy (284.exterior extrinsic carbon, derived from the sample and the XPS instrument itself (Yang et al. 2015;Zheng et al. 2014).The high-resolution XPS spectra of N 1s were indexed into four peaks at binding energies 398.4,399.0, 400.3, and 404.2 eV, respectively, as shown in Fig. 7c.The highest peak at 398.4 eV binding energies is ascribed to sp 2 -hybridized aromatic nitrogen bonding in the triazine rings with two carbon atoms (C-NC).The peak at 400.3 eV correlates to the tertiary nitrogen N-(C)3 groups.Both peaks jointly with sp 2hybridized carbon (N-CN, at 288.0 eV) conform to heptazine heterocyclic ring units which are the essential building substructure for g-C 3 N 4 .The weak peak at 400.3 eV can be allocated to N-H bonds which indicate the presence of amino functional groups due to the deficient concentration of poly (tri-s-triazine) structures (Gu et al. 2015;Qin et al. 2015).The weakest peak at binding energy (404.2eV) can be credited to -excitations or positive charge localization in the heterocycles (Li et al. 2015a, b, c, d;Yu et al. 2014a, b). Figure 8a shows the optical properties of HC-C 3 N 4 and bulk C 3 N 4 samples which exhibited similarities in their absorption spectra.From the spectra, it could be observed that all the samples show light absorption from the UV region to the visible range up to 700 nm.However, the HC-C 3 N 4 samples show slight changes in the absorption and bandgap energy owing to the introduction of pores in the structure.This porous structure has enhanced the light-harvesting ability of the HC-C 3 N 4 samples in the whole optical spectrum showing a slight improvement in absorption especially from a wavelength of 425 nm owing to the numerous reflections of incident light within the hollows or pores in the C 3 N 4 structure (Kailasam et al. 2011;Zheng et al. 2014).Furthermore, a minor blue shift in the absorption edge at ca. 465 nm in the bulk C 3 N 4 is shifted to 450 nm for the HC-C 3 N 4 , implies that the bandgap energy is improved from 2.66 to 2.75 eV (Fig. 8b).This result suggests the existence of a quantum confinement effect in the HC-C 3 N 4 due to incomplete condensation (Kang et al. 2015).Besides, the as-prepared HC-C 3 N 4 samples also exhibited deeper brownish yellow color than the bulk C 3 N 4 which is shown as an inset in Fig. 8a.This color variation could also be attributed to the incomplete condensation process with excess carbon in the sample as estimated in the C:N molar ratio in the EDX elemental analysis.Another important parameter used in estimating the efficiency of photocatalytic activity is photoluminescence (PL) spectra.The PL emission spectra resulted from the resequencing rate of photogenerated electrons and hole pairs (Yu et al. 2014a, b).So, the PL method is used to measure the charge carrier's dissolution or recombination rates of the photocatalysts.Generally, the stronger the PL peak intensity, the superior the re-sequencing ability of the photoexcited electron-hole pairs and thus the lower the photocatalytic activity of the photocatalyst (Yu et al. 2003).Figure 9 shows one broad PL peak around ca. 451 and 463 nm for HC-C 3 N 4 and bulk C 3 N 4 samples, respectively.This is due to the band-band PL occurrence and very close to their respective bandgap energies (Zheng et al. 2014).It can be noticed that the HC-C 3 N 4 samples have decreased PL intensities and stronger PL quenching relative to the bulk C 3 N 4 samples.This suggests effective suppression in the re-sequencing rate of photoexcited charge transfer and hence efficient charge separation in the HC-C 3 N 4 samples which would favor higher photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity. Besides, to probe the charge transfer process in the asprepared samples, a time-resolved PL fluorescence decay study was carried out.According to the fluorescence lifetime decay curves and fitted parameters (Fig. 10 a andb), the short lifetime or fast component that is owing to the decomposition from free exciton states decreased from 2.6940 for the bulk C 3 N 4 down to 2.4488 ns for the HC-C 3 N 4 .Also, the long lifetime or marginal sluggish component which emerged from the bound exciton states decreases from 12.5566 for the bulk C 3 N 4 to 12.2361 ns for the HC-C 3 N 4 .The above result shows that fluorescence lifetimes are much reduced after the addition of hollows or pores in the C 3 N 4 matrix.The reduce of the emission strength and its lifetime signify to the reduction of a fraction of HC-C 3 N 4 excitons (or excited states) arise through a non-radiative pathway, probably by charge relocation of electron and hole pairs with high mobility to fresh restricted/surface states which were created in the honeycomb structure of the C 3 N 4 (Gao et al. 2013;Shalom et al. 2014;Jiang et al. 2016). To further have an in-depth understanding and more information about the charge carriers and photoelectrochemical properties of the as-prepared samples, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) examination was carried out.Figure 11 shows the Nyquist plots which indicated that the as-prepared HC-C 3 N 4 samples exhibited significantly lower semicircle arc compared with other samples.This suggests inhibition in the rearrangement of photogenerated electrons and holes and hence higher migration of charge carriers.However, the large semicircle arc observed in the bulk C 3 N 4 can be ascribed to faster rearrangement of photogenerated electrons and holes pairs. Consecutively, to ensure that the as-prepared HC-C 3 N 4 is suitable for photoreduction of CO 2 reduction under visible Fig. 9 PL spectra of as-prepared samples light, the band energy level structure was examined by the Mott-Schottky analysis.The flat band potential (E FB ) measurements were performed using the electrochemical technique to approximately estimate the conduction band edge potentials (E CB ). Figure 12a shows the Mott-Schottky plots of the HC-C 3 N 4 and bulk C 3 N 4 samples, which exhibited ntype characteristic semiconductor features with positive slopes.This suggests that electrons serve as majority charge carriers (Zhan et al. 2015).Depending on the Mott-Schottky plots, the conduction band potentials (E CB ) of HC-C 3 N 4 and bulk C 3 N 4 were derived to be -1.51V and -1.20 V, respectively.The bandgap energies (E g ) were obtained using the Tauc plots of the Kubelka-Munk function (Fig. 8b), and the valence band potentials (E VB ) were calculated from the formula E CB E VB -E g to be 1.24 and 1.46 V for HC-C 3 N 4 and bulk C 3 N 4 , respectively.Figure 12b proves the schematic design of the alignment of band energy levels which indicated that both HC-C 3 N 4 and bulk C 3 N 4 samples thermodynamically satisfy the condition for CO 2 photocatalytic reduction.Further from Fig. 12b, it could be observed that CB of the HC-C 3 N 4 changes to the more negative potential location, while the VB edge shifts to less positive value relative to the bulk C 3 N 4 sample.Generally, it has been established that the more negative CB value, the more decreases photoexcited electrons are produced and transferred to reactants, alongside lesser recombination rate due to rapid charge carrier transportability (Liu et al. 2010).Based on this, under visible light irradiation, the HC-C 3 N 4 sample has a more excellent electronic band structure and the photocatalytic reductive ability for reactants than the bulk C 3 N 4 .Upon loading Ni(OH) 2 cocatalyst through the intimate contact between HC-C 3 N 4 and Ni(OH) 2 , achieve improved visible light CO 2 reduction, the photoexcited electrons would effectively migrate from the HC-C 3 N 4 to the Ni(OH) 2 , to produce CH 4 and CH 3 OH via photocatalytic reaction, where Ni(OH) 2 acts as an electron receiver which significantly enhanced CO 2 reduction activity over the composited HC-C 3 N 4 /Ni(OH) 2 photocatalyst. The complete photocatalytic CO 2 reduction movement over the catalyst can be compiled as follows: The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity of the HC-C 3 N 4 and bulk C 3 N 4 samples was calculated under simulated visible light irradiation ( 400 nm), and the representative authentic chromatogram is shown in Fig. 13a.The products detected under photoactivity are shown in Fig. 13b.The tests were carried out fewer than two distinct controlled conditions.In the first, experiments were conducted without visible light irradiation, and in the second, experiments were conducted in the absence of a photocatalyst, which showed no detection of hydrocarbon products.This proposes that a photocatalyst and light irradiation are two important aspects for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 into hydrocarbon products.This further proves that the hydrocarbon products were generated via photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with water vapor over the photocatalyst under visible light irradiation.CH 4 and CH 3 OH continue to be the major hydrocarbon products, and additional noticeable hydrocarbon compounds like HCOOH, C 2 H 5 OH, HCHO, and CO were detected at ambient temperature and pressure condition.As compared with Fig. 13b, the HC-C 3 N 4 sample exhibited high photocatalytic formation of hydrocarbon products (i.e., CH 4 and CH 3 OH) than the bulk C 3 N 4 .Since the chemical content of the HC-C 3 N 4 and bulk C 3 N 4 are the same, the improved photoactivity of the HC-C 3 N 4 may be ascribed to the following factors observed in the structural properties.Firstly, the unique hollow or macropores introduced into the C 3 N 4 matrix result in a large surface area that offers the introduction of additional vigorous catalytic sites and channels for photocatalytic reactions.The hollows in the HC-C 3 N 4 are in addition advantageous for rapid mass diffusion of photogenerated carriers leading to their higher probability of participation in surface redox reactions without recombination.Secondly, the increase mesoporosity in the HC-C 3 N 4 sample has decreased the wall thickness of the C 3 N 4 matrix and increased its visible light absorption ability more.This has lowered its flat potential and higher beneficiary electron density which thermodynamically promotes photocatalytic reaction.Furthermore, the higher degree of electron delocalization in the HC-C 3 N 4 is due to its poor crystallization nature which has contributed to the improvement in charge dissolution efficiency of the generated transporters.To improve the charge separation capability of the HC-C 3 N 4 samples, Ni(OH) 2 was used as a lowcost cocatalyst.It was observed that the HC-C 3 N 4 /Ni(OH) 2 sample has the highest hydrocarbon product formation rate (1.48 molh -1 g -1 of CH 4 generation and 0.73 molh -1 g -1 of CH 3 OH generation).This can be ascribed to efficient interfacial electron mobility starting HC-C 3 N 4 to Ni(OH) 2 nanoparticles and thus prevents rearrangement of photoexcited electron-hole pairs.This led to effective charge dissolution and as a result improved the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity.Further, Table 2 shows the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity of various C 3 N 4 -based photocatalysts.It was found that the HC-C 3 N 4 cocatalyst with Ni(OH) 2 exhibits enhanced or comparable photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activities compared with most of the previously reported C 3 N 4based photocatalysts.Therefore, it could be concluded that doping earth-abundant cocatalyst could substantially enhance CO 2 reduction activity and could be replaced by an expensive noble metal or toxic metal sulfides. Stability is of great importance for determining the practical application performance of a given photocatalyst.The stability of HC-C 3 N 4 /Ni(OH) 2 , the five repetitive runs with each run of 3 h for visible light CO 2 reduction were measured, and the results are shown in Fig. 14a.After each run, the light irradiation was stopped, the reactor was evacuated and then refilled with 0.12 g NaHCO 3 (introduced into the reactor before sealing), and 0.25 mL 4 M HCl solution (introduced into the reactor by a syringe) apart from this no catalyst washing or fresh introduction was performed.Clearly from our results, the methanol and methane production activity remains unchanged for the first and the second runs, and it slightly decreased in the successive run.The above result indicates that the as-prepared HC-C 3 N 4 /Ni(OH) 2 , sample exhibits admirable stability during the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity.Besides, the comparison of the PXRD pattern of HC-C 3 N 4 / Ni(OH) 2 samples before and after the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction is also examined (Fig. 14b).The intensity of diffraction peaks did not showed any significant difference in the PXRD patterns, conforming that the as-prepared HC-C 3 N 4 / Ni(OH) 2 photocatalyst are essentially stable and suitable for CO 2 reduction. Consecutively, to further support the improved photocatalytic performance observed in the HC-C 3 N 4 samples, a photoelectrochemical (PEC) analysis was performed.This was done to explore the photoinduced electron or charge mobility processes in the as-prepared samples cast on FTO glass.Figure 15 illustrates the correlation of I-t curves of fast photocurrent feedback in the electrodes of prepared samples.It can be realized that the photocurrent quickly reduces to the initial state as the light was turned off and proceeds reverse to a stable charge when the light is turned on.This is an indication of the transportation of most photoproduced electrons back to the unity across the sample to generate photocurrent under visible light irradiation.A significantly higher photocurrent was observed in HC-C 3 N 4 as-prepared electrodes especially HC-C 3 N 4 /Ni(OH) 2 compared with the other electrodes.The result suggests that the rearrangement rate of electrons and holes pairs is significantly inhibited, and thus, charge dissolution and transfer efficiency have improved"}]}}
