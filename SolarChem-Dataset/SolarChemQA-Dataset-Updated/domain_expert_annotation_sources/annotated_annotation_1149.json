Synthesis of Pt/TiO 2 .Pt/TiO 2 was also prepared by photodeposition.To minimize the irrelevant variables in the comparison experiment and keep the loading concentration as consistent as possible, 1 g of the PtO/TiO 2 sample obtained above was used as a raw material, dispersed into a 200 mL deionized water solution, and stirred for 30 min.The suspension was then irradiated by a Xe lamp under continuous stirring with N 2 as a protective gas.After irradiation for 1 h, the solid samples were centrifuged, washed three times with deionized water, and dried at 60 1C for 12 h to obtain Pt/TiO 2 . X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of all powder samples were recorded on an Empyrean diffractometer using CuKa radiation (l 0.1542 nm) in the range of 201-801.The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas were obtained from the N 2 adsorptiondesorption isotherms measured at 77 K using a Micrometrics model ASAP 2000 instrument; all samples were degassed at 150 1C and 10 A6 Torr for 3 h prior to the measurement.The concentration of Pt in the catalysts was measured by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) using a SPECTRO ARCOS instrument.The surface atomic composition of the catalysts and the chemical states of Pt were determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) using Shimadzu/KRATOS AXIS-ULTRA DLD-600W equipment with Al/MgKa radiation.Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were recorded using a FEI Tecnai G 2 F30 instrument.Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy was performed using a confocal laser LabRAM HR800 instrument with a 325 nm excitation light source.The UV-vis spectra of the samples were recorded over the wavelength range of 200-800 nm using a Lambda 35 spectrophotometer.Temperature-programmed H 2 reduction (H 2 -TPR) measurements were conducted using an Autochem II 2920 instrument.Temperature-programmed CO desorption (CO-TPD) measurements were conducted using a ChemiSorb 2720 instrument. In situ Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) spectra were collected using a Nicolet iS50 spectrometer (Thermo Fisher) with a Praying Mantis DRIFTS accessory.The IR reaction cell (Harrick Scientific, HVC-DRP) was equipped with two ZnSe windows and a quartz window for IR-and UV-light transmission.A 300 W Xe lamp was used as the UV-light source.First, the baseline was collected after continuous introduction of ultrapure N 2 gas into the reactor cell filled with sample for at least 30 min. In a typical humidified CO 2 photoreduction IR experiment, humidified CO 2 vapor was introduced to the IR reaction cell for 60 min, and the signal was collected.Then, the light source was switched on and the signal was recorded after irradiation for 60 min. In a typical CO adsorption IR experiment, the sample was exposed to 1 CO/N 2 flow for 30 min, and purged again with N 2 for another 30 min until the gas phase CO signal was completely reduced and the catalyst surface adsorption spectra showed no obvious differences between the IR scans.Afterwards, CO adsorption spectra were collected. All photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurements were performed using a standard three-electrode electrochemical workstation (CHI770E) consisting of platinum foil as the counter electrode, ITO coated with a catalyst as the working electrode, and Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode.A 300 W Xe lamp equipped with an AM1.5 filter was used as the irradiation source and 0.5 M aqueous Na 2 SO 4 solution was used as the electrode.The function of photocurrent density changing with time (J-t) was measured under a fixed bias of 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl.Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed at an amplitude of 5 mV and a frequency range of 0.01-100 kHz. CO 2 photocatalytic reduction CO 2 photocatalytic reduction experiments were conducted at 15 1C under UV-light irradiation in an internal circulated reaction system, as reported in our previous work. 33A 300 W Xe lamp was employed to supply the UV light irradiation (300 nm o l o 400 nm, 20 mW cm A2 ).Typically, 20 mg of catalyst in a Petri dish (diameter, 40 mm) and 5 mL of deionized water were added to the bottom of the reactor.After the system was placed under vacuum, ultrapure CO 2 (99.999) was injected to pressurize the reaction system to 71 kPa. A GC equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID), a thermal conductivity detector (TCD), and a methanizer was employed to analyze the concentrations of H 2 , CO, CH 4 , and hydrocarbons every hour.Blank experiments with CO 2 , catalyst, and illumination as control variables were performed before the reaction to ensure that the gas components detected by GC all resulted from the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction. CO adsorption on Pt 8 O 8 /TiO 2 (101) and Pt 12 /TiO 2 (101) surfaces in different positions was studied by using periodic density functional theory (DFT). 34,35Generalized gradient approximation (GGA), based on the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional 36 was used for the exchange-correlation energy.The Kohn-Sham one-electron valence states were expanded from a basis of plane waves with an energy cutoff of 450 eV.All calculations were performed by the CASTEP software package.The anatase TiO 2 (101) surface was modeled as a three-layer p(1 A 3) slab, corresponding to 36 TiO 2 unit cells (108 atoms), to which a vacuum layer of 15 A was applied and the top layer of TiO 2 was allowed to relax.Because of the large size of the supercell, Monkhorst Pack mesh with G point k-point sampling in the surface Brillouin zone was used. 37The force convergence criterion in the structural was set to 0.05 eV A A1 .The adsorption energies were calculated using the equation E ads E sys A E iso , where E ads is the adsorption energy, E sys is the calculated total energy of the system, and E iso is the summed energy of the isolated molecule and bare surface. The cumulative production of CH 4 , CO, and H 2 after UV irradiation for 8 h with PtO/TiO 2 , Pt/TiO 2 , and TiO 2 as catalysts, is presented in Fig. 1 and Table 1.Production over PtO/TiO 2 and Pt/TiO 2 was increased compared over TiO 2 , but an even more noticeable difference was the different product selectivity of the catalysts.The selectivity of both TiO 2 and PtO/TiO 2 for CH 4 was very poor.When PtO was loaded onto TiO 2 , the yield of CO and H 2 increased significantly, by 43 and 47, respectively, indicating that PtO loading could facilitate the generation of CO and H 2 .However, for Pt/TiO 2 , CH 4 was produced and the yield reached 3.99 mmol g A1 , while the production of CO was suppressed, indicating good selectivity for CH 4 .The cycling performance was analyzed to investigate the stability of PtO/TiO 2 and Pt/TiO 2 .As shown in Fig. S1 (ESI ), after 3 cycles over a total of 24 h, the total production has decreased by approximately 11 and 16, respectively, demonstrating a good stability and sustainability.The reduction of CO 2 to CH 4 requires more electrons and protons than the production of CO.Therefore, to explore the reasons for the reversed selectivity -that is, after the reduction of PtO to Pt, the dominant product of photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 over the catalyst changes from CO to CH 4 -the physicochemical properties of the catalysts were analyzed. The XRD patterns (Fig. 2) showed that Pt and PtO loading did not change the crystal structure of TiO 2 .The peaks marked A are the characteristic peaks of anatase, and the peaks marked R are the characteristic peaks of rutile, indicating that the TiO 2 in the three samples existed in a mixed phase of anatase and rutile; these findings were in good agreement with the literature. 38he ICP-OES results, listed in Table 2, confirmed that the Pt concentration of the prepared samples was consistent.The chemical states of the Pt species on the surface of catalysts were analyzed by XPS (Fig. 3a).A pair of peaks corresponding to Pt 2 were clearly observed in the spectra of PtO/TiO 2 at to the binding energies of 72.7 eV and 75.8 eV. 21,22No obvious signal attributable to Pt 0 was observed, indicating that Pt 2 was the dominant Pt species in PtO/TiO 2 .The Pt 4f XPS spectra of Pt/TiO 2 indicated binding energies of 71.0 eV and 74.7 eV corresponding to Pt 0 , accompanied by two weak peaks of Pt 2 , which may have been caused by the oxidation of Pt 0 nanoparticles. 23It is generally believed that the binding energy of Pt 0 as Pt 4f 7/2 is 71.2 eV. 39,40n contrast, the peak in Fig. 3a had a slightly negative deviation, corresponding to the configurations of 2p for Ti (Fig. 3b) and 1s for O (Fig. 3c), which indicated the formation of a heterojunction between TiO 2 and Pt and, consequently, the transfer of electrons from TiO 2 to Pt.The HR-TEM images of PtO/TiO 2 and Pt/TiO 2 are shown in Fig. 4a andf, and the size of the loaded particles is listed in Table 2.For PtO/TiO 2 , ultrafine PtO nanoparticles (average size 0.9 nm) were highly dispersed on the surface of TiO 2 ; in contrast, for Pt/TiO 2 , the Pt nanoparticles obtained by PtO reduction were clearly larger (average size 1.9 nm) and there were fewer particles.In addition, the size distribution of PtO particles was much narrower than that of Pt particles.These findings indicated that Pt nanoparticles migrated and grew up during the photoreduction process of PtO.As shown in the HADDF-STEM images (Fig. 4b andg), the PtO and Pt nanoparticles were distributed evenly on the TiO 2 surface.To further verify the components of PtO/TiO 2 and Pt/TiO 2 , EDX elemental mappings of Ti, O and Pt were investigated by STEM (Fig. 4c-e andh-j).The red and green areas are consistent with TiO 2 in HAADF-STEM images, whereas the yellow areas are consistent with the particles supported on TiO 2 surface.In addition, the XPS spectrum showed that the Pt element exists mainly in the form of Pt 2 in PtO/TiO 2 and Pt 0 in Pt/TiO 2 .Given this information, we can conclude that the particles on the surface of the two catalysts comprised mainly PtO and Pt. The UV-vis absorption spectra of samples are presented in Fig. 5a.The bandgap energy (E g ) was calculated from the formulas, E g 1240/l and (Ahn) n k(hn A E g ), where A is the absorption coefficient, k is a constant, n is 0.5 for semiconductors with an indirect band gap, hn is the energy of absorbed photon, and E g is the band gap energy. 41As shown in Fig. 5b, the bandgap energies of TiO 2 , PtO/TiO 2 , and Pt/TiO 2 were calculated as 3.41 eV, 3.25 eV, and 3.16 eV, respectively.The results showed that Pt and PtO both reduced the band gap of TiO 2 and enhanced the movement of photogenerated carriers; however, Pt resulted in a greater reduction.The reduced bandgap of PtO/TiO 2 and Pt/TiO 2 may be cause by the formation of Pt-O-Pt bonds between PtO and TiO 2 as well as Pt and TiO 2 .Additionally, Pt particles are more active and interact more strongly with TiO 2 , leading to a greater reduction in the TiO 2 bandgap. 42he PL emission spectra of PtO/TiO 2 , Pt/TiO 2 , and TiO 2 were recorded to investigate the efficiency of carrier transfer and separation (Fig. 6).For all samples, the emission peaks were present at approximately 550 nm, and were attributable to the band gap transition. 43The luminescence intensity of the three catalysts was different, from strong to weak, respectively: TiO 2 4 PtO/TiO 2 4 Pt/TiO 2 .This indicated that the loading of either Pt or PtO was beneficial to the separation of photoelectron-hole pairs.In addition, the loading of Pt nanoparticles had a greater ability to inhibit the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs than compared with loading of PtO, thus increasing the concentration of free electrons and providing more electrons for CO 2 reduction, which can be helpful for the production of CH 4 . The photocurrent response is reflection of the separation property of photogenerated electron and photogenerated hole.The higher the photocurrent, the higher the separation efficiency of photoelectron-hole pairs.As shown in Fig. 7, the photocurrent response exhibited the same trends as the PL emission spectra: the loading of Pt helped to enhance the photocurrent intensity, but the loading of PtO resulted in a weaker enhancement compared to Pt.These results indicated that the loading of Pt increased the concentration of free electrons and accelerated charge separation.Further, EIS Nyquist plots were generated to characterize charge transfer resistance (Fig. 8).The relative size of the radius of the arc on the Nyquist diagram corresponds to the size of the charge transfer resistance and the separation efficiency of the photogenerated electron hole pairs.The smaller the arc radius of the impedance spectrum, the better the separation effect of photogenerated electron-hole pairs.Compared with TiO 2 , Pt/TiO 2 , with the smallest radius, showed the lowest resistance; hence, PtO/TiO 2 , with the largest radius, showed the highest resistance, meaning that Pt loading assisted electron transfer but PtO loading suppressed electron transfer.Therefore, we concluded that Pt/TiO 2 could not only inhibit the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs but also facilitate charge transfer. The first step in CO 2 reduction is the adsorption of CO 2 on the catalyst surface.Therefore, the in-situ FT-IR spectra of CO 2 -carrying water vapor adsorbed on Pt/TiO 2 and PtO/TiO 2 surfaces in the dark for 60 min and under illumination for 60 min were collected (Fig. 10).The peak at 1662 cm A1 was assigned to H 2 O. 44 The peaks at 1595 cm A1 and 1392 cm A1 were attributed to HCO 3 A , which was formed by CO 2 and OH groups on the surface, and the peak at 1489 cm A1 was attributed to CO 3 2A , which was formed by the CO 2 and O groups. 45,46For Pt/ TiO 2 , after irradiation with UV light for 1 h, the IR peak for the CO 2 A species, an important intermediate in CO 2 reduction, was observed at 1714 cm A1 , 44,47 suggesting that CO 2 was successfully adsorbed and activated on the Pt/TiO 2 surface.Meanwhile, HCO 3 A and CO 3 2A clearly increased, indicating that Pt/TiO 2 could further activate and transform CO 2 .However, no obvious peaks at 1489 cm A1 and 1392 cm A1 were observed in the spectrum of PtO/TiO 2 , and the peak of CO 2 A was hard to observe, suggesting that the activation and conversion of CO 2 over PtO/ TiO 2 did not occur as easily as over Pt/TiO 2 . It is known that the selectivity of CO 2 reduction is greatly affected by the chemical state of the metal cocatalysts.The Pt 4f XPS spectra of Pt/TiO 2 (Fig. 9a) and PtO/TiO 2 (Fig. 9b) before and after CO 2 photoreduction experiments were recorded and compared.The results showed that the chemical state of the Pt species did not change after the reaction, which eliminated the possibility that the reversed product selectivity was caused by a change in the chemical state of Pt during the photoreduction of CO 2 . To further study the effect of platinum valence states on the hydrogenation of CO 2 to methane, H 2 -TPR experiments were conducted (Fig. 11).A strong peak appeared at 332 1C in the profile of the Pt/TiO 2 catalyst; this peak was attributable to the reduction of TiO 2 near Pt particles by H 2 , assisted by Pt, 48 indicating that Pt could effectively activate the catalyst surface, allowing the easy adsorption and dissociation of H 2 on the surface of Pt/TiO 2 .In comparison, there was a weak peak in the TPR profile of the PtO/TiO 2 catalyst at 314 1C, indicating that it was hard for H 2 to adsorb and dissociate on PtO/TiO 2 .Therefore, in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 , as H will readily form H 2 and then desorb from the PtO/TiO 2 surface when reduced, 49 the H 2 back-reaction is suppressed on PtO/TiO 2 , thereby not only promoting H 2 production but also inhibiting hydrogenation of CO 2 .In contrast, on the Pt/TiO 2 surface, the presence of Pt keeps Fig. 9 The IR spectra of CO 2 and water co-adsorbed on PtO/TiO 2 and Pt/TiO 2 . reduced H atoms on the Pt surface, which favors the participation of hydrogen in the hydrogenation of CO 2 to methane. For the solid-gas reaction, the main product of CO 2 reduction is CO, rather than CH 4 , owing to the high energy barrier and the increased number of carriers and protons needed during CH 4 formation.As the key intermediate during the process, the further reduction of CO is crucial to the product selectivity change of Pt and PtO as co-catalysts in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 . 50,51To further explore the mechanism, TPD and in situ DRIFTS were used to analyze CO. CO-TPD was performed to study the adsorption of CO on Pt/TiO 2 and PtO/TiO 2 .The results in Fig. 12 show that Pt/TiO 2 had significantly larger CO chemisorption capacity than PtO/ TiO 2 as determined from the area of CO desorption peaks.Notably, the CO desorption on Pt/TiO 2 peaked at approximately 152 1C, but that on PtO/TiO 2 began to flatten out at approximately 110 1C, demonstrating that CO adsorption on Pt/TiO 2 was stronger than that on PtO/TiO 2 .This suggested that Pt/TiO 2 favored the further reduction of CO to CH 4 .This may be because the highly dispersed PtO particles, which were smaller, occupied more adsorption sites on the TiO 2 surface, whereas Pt particles migrated and aggregated during the photochemical reduction of PtO into Pt, re-exposing the adsorption sites on the catalyst surface. 52O-FTIR analysis was also performed to provide further understanding of the adsorption sites of CO on Pt/TiO 2 and PtO/TiO 2 .The IR spectra of CO adsorbed on the surface of PtO/ TiO 2 and Pt/TiO 2 are shown in Fig. 13.The bands for linearly adsorbed CO were observed at 2091 cm A1 and 2070 cm A1 , corresponding to Pt terrace sites and low-coordination sites, respectively, and the band for bridge-type adsorbed CO was observed at 1853 cm A1 .53,54 The intensity ratio of IR peaks for linear-type to bridge-type was 1.7 : 1 for Pt/TiO 2 and 1.2 : 1 for PtO/TiO 2 , indicating that linearly coordinated CO could form more easily on the surface of Pt than PtO co-catalysts.In addition, it is well known that the low-coordination sites can more easily activate the reactants, acting as a trap for electrons and facilitating the photocatalytic reduction of CO. 20 Compared with Pt/TiO 2 , no significant enhancement was observed for the IR peak of CO adsorbed on the Pt terrace sites of PtO/TiO 2 despite the larger quantity and smaller size of PtO particles compared with Pt particles; this may have been due to the overstabilization of the Pt atoms by coordination with the oxygen in PtO/TiO 2 , 52 resulting in the deactivation of this site and the inhibition of further CO reduction. To explore how the relative activity of metallic Pt and oxidized Pt species affects CO reduction, the CO adsorption energies on the surface platinum atom of Pt 8 O 8 /TiO 2 (101) and Pt 12 /TiO 2 (101) were calculated.The Pt 12 cluster and Pt 8 O 8 cluster supported by the TiO 2 (101) surface were selected to simulate these two co-catalysts (Fig. S2,ESI ).The number of Pt atoms in the cluster was determined from the distribution and particle size obtained by TEM (Fig. 4), and the adsorption sites were determined by CO-FTIR (Fig. 13).All the successful adsorption structures of CO on Pt 8 O 8 /TiO 2 (101) and Pt 12 / TiO 2 (101) are shown in Fig. S3 and S4 (ESI ); the adsorption energy and Mulliken charges are listed in order in Table S1 (ESI ).The most stable sites are listed separately (Fig. 14 and Table 1), and further partial density of states (PDOS) analysis of CO adsorption was conducted for these sites.As shown in Table 1, the CO adsorption energy on Pt/TiO 2 was higher than that on PtO/TiO 2 at the top site and bridge site, respectively, suggesting that the adsorption of CO on metallic Pt was stronger than that of oxidized Pt species. The enhancement of CO adsorption ability by Pt and PtO was further examined by analysis of the PDOS of CO adsorbed on the Pt 8 O 8 /TiO 2 (101) and Pt 12 /TiO 2 (101) surfaces, as shown in Fig. 15, as well as the Mulliken charges listed in Table 3.As shown in Fig. 15, compared with free CO, in the PDOS of CO adsorption on these two models, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals of CO shifted down toward the Fermi energy level, demonstrating electron transfer from PtO and Pt clusters to CO.Even more remarkable was the more intense hybridization near the Fermi energy level in the PDOS of CO on Pt/TiO 2 , suggesting that the Pt cluster had a greater ability to transfer electrons to CO, corresponding to the more negative Mulliken charges of adsorbed CO, which were A0.19e A and A0.34e A at the top site and bridge site, respectively, whereas those of CO adsorbed on the PtO cluster were A0.08e A and A0.21e A , respectively (Table 3).The results provide a good explanation for the 1.36 eV and 1.38 eV higher CO adsorption energy on the Pt/TiO 2 surface at the top and bridge sites, respectively, than on the PtO/TiO 2 surface.Furthermore, from the PDOS (Fig. 15b) and Mulliken charges (Table 3), more electrons on the Pt/TiO 2 surface at the top site are donated to CO as compared with the bridge site, indicating that there were stronger electronic interactions between CO and the Pt/TiO 2 surface at the top site, providing good support of the results of CO-FTIR.hydrogenation of CO 2 .In contrast, for Pt/TiO 2 , it is difficult to desorb CO from Pt owing to the strong adsorption ability and electronic interactions, and H can remain adsorbed on the Pt surface after being reduced, further hydrogenating CO to CH 4 (Fig. 16)."}, {"llm generation": "TiO2 (P25)", "source": "First, 1 g of TiO 2 (P25) was dispersed into 200 mL H 2 PtCl 6 solution (the mass ratio of Pt to TiO 2 was 1), and stirred for 30 min to fully mix the components.", "context": "Synthesis of PtO/TiO 2 .PtO/TiO 2 was prepared by photodeposition.First, 1 g of TiO 2 (P25) was dispersed into 200 mL H 2 PtCl 6 solution (the mass ratio of Pt to TiO 2 was 1), and stirred for 30 min to fully mix the components.The suspension was then irradiated by a Xe lamp under continuously stirring in air.After irradiation for 1 h, the solid samples were centrifuged, washed three times with deionized water, and dried at 60 1C for 12 h to obtain PtO/TiO 2 .

CO adsorption on Pt 8 O 8 /TiO 2 (101) and Pt 12 /TiO 2 (101) surfaces in different positions was studied by using periodic density functional theory (DFT). 34,35Generalized gradient approximation (GGA), based on the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional 36 was used for the exchange-correlation energy.The Kohn-Sham one-electron valence states were expanded from a basis of plane waves with an energy cutoff of 450 eV.All calculations were performed by the CASTEP software package.The anatase TiO 2 (101) surface was modeled as a three-layer p(1 A 3) slab, corresponding to 36 TiO 2 unit cells (108 atoms), to which a vacuum layer of 15 A was applied and the top layer of TiO 2 was allowed to relax.Because of the large size of the supercell, Monkhorst Pack mesh with G point k-point sampling in the surface Brillouin zone was used. 37The force convergence criterion in the structural was set to 0.05 eV A A1 .The adsorption energies were calculated using the equation E ads E sys A E iso , where E ads is the adsorption energy, E sys is the calculated total energy of the system, and E iso is the summed energy of the isolated molecule and bare surface. The cumulative production of CH 4 , CO, and H 2 after UV irradiation for 8 h with PtO/TiO 2 , Pt/TiO 2 , and TiO 2 as catalysts, is presented in Fig. 1 and Table 1.Production over PtO/TiO 2 and Pt/TiO 2 was increased compared over TiO 2 , but an even more noticeable difference was the different product selectivity of the catalysts.The selectivity of both TiO 2 and PtO/TiO 2 for CH 4 was very poor.When PtO was loaded onto TiO 2 , the yield of CO and H 2 increased significantly, by 43 and 47, respectively, indicating that PtO loading could facilitate the generation of CO and H 2 .However, for Pt/TiO 2 , CH 4 was produced and the yield reached 3.99 mmol g A1 , while the production of CO was suppressed, indicating good selectivity for CH 4 .The cycling performance was analyzed to investigate the stability of PtO/TiO 2 and Pt/TiO 2 .As shown in Fig. S1 (ESI ), after 3 cycles over a total of 24 h, the total production has decreased by approximately 11 and 16, respectively, demonstrating a good stability and sustainability.The reduction of CO 2 to CH 4 requires more electrons and protons than the production of CO.Therefore, to explore the reasons for the reversed selectivity -that is, after the reduction of PtO to Pt, the dominant product of photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 over the catalyst changes from CO to CH 4 -the physicochemical properties of the catalysts were analyzed. The XRD patterns (Fig. 2) showed that Pt and PtO loading did not change the crystal structure of TiO 2 .The peaks marked A are the characteristic peaks of anatase, and the peaks marked R are the characteristic peaks of rutile, indicating that the TiO 2 in the three samples existed in a mixed phase of anatase and rutile; these findings were in good agreement with the literature. 38he ICP-OES results, listed in Table 2, confirmed that the Pt concentration of the prepared samples was consistent.The chemical states of the Pt species on the surface of catalysts were analyzed by XPS (Fig. 3a).A pair of peaks corresponding to Pt 2 were clearly observed in the spectra of PtO/TiO 2 at to the binding energies of 72.7 eV and 75.8 eV. 21,22No obvious signal attributable to Pt 0 was observed, indicating that Pt 2 was the dominant Pt species in PtO/TiO 2 .The Pt 4f XPS spectra of Pt/TiO 2 indicated binding energies of 71.0 eV and 74.7 eV corresponding to Pt 0 , accompanied by two weak peaks of Pt 2 , which may have been caused by the oxidation of Pt 0 nanoparticles. 23It is generally believed that the binding energy of Pt 0 as Pt 4f 7/2 is 71.2 eV. 39,40n contrast, the peak in Fig. 3a had a slightly negative deviation, corresponding to the configurations of 2p for Ti (Fig. 3b) and 1s for O (Fig. 3c), which indicated the formation of a heterojunction between TiO 2 and Pt and, consequently, the transfer of electrons from TiO 2 to Pt.The HR-TEM images of PtO/TiO 2 and Pt/TiO 2 are shown in Fig. 4a andf, and the size of the loaded particles is listed in Table 2.For PtO/TiO 2 , ultrafine PtO nanoparticles (average size 0.9 nm) were highly dispersed on the surface of TiO 2 ; in contrast, for Pt/TiO 2 , the Pt nanoparticles obtained by PtO reduction were clearly larger (average size 1.9 nm) and there were fewer particles.In addition, the size distribution of PtO particles was much narrower than that of Pt particles.These findings indicated that Pt nanoparticles migrated and grew up during the photoreduction process of PtO.As shown in the HADDF-STEM images (Fig. 4b andg), the PtO and Pt nanoparticles were distributed evenly on the TiO 2 surface.To further verify the components of PtO/TiO 2 and Pt/TiO 2 , EDX elemental mappings of Ti, O and Pt were investigated by STEM (Fig. 4c-e andh-j).The red and green areas are consistent with TiO 2 in HAADF-STEM images, whereas the yellow areas are consistent with the particles supported on TiO 2 surface.In addition, the XPS spectrum showed that the Pt element exists mainly in the form of Pt 2 in PtO/TiO 2 and Pt 0 in Pt/TiO 2 .Given this information, we can conclude that the particles on the surface of the two catalysts comprised mainly PtO and Pt. The UV-vis absorption spectra of samples are presented in Fig. 5a.The bandgap energy (E g ) was calculated from the formulas, E g 1240/l and (Ahn) n k(hn A E g ), where A is the absorption coefficient, k is a constant, n is 0.5 for semiconductors with an indirect band gap, hn is the energy of absorbed photon, and E g is the band gap energy. 41As shown in Fig. 5b, the bandgap energies of TiO 2 , PtO/TiO 2 , and Pt/TiO 2 were calculated as 3.41 eV, 3.25 eV, and 3.16 eV, respectively.The results showed that Pt and PtO both reduced the band gap of TiO 2 and enhanced the movement of photogenerated carriers; however, Pt resulted in a greater reduction.The reduced bandgap of PtO/TiO 2 and Pt/TiO 2 may be cause by the formation of Pt-O-Pt bonds between PtO and TiO 2 as well as Pt and TiO 2 .Additionally, Pt particles are more active and interact more strongly with TiO 2 , leading to a greater reduction in the TiO 2 bandgap. 42he PL emission spectra of PtO/TiO 2 , Pt/TiO 2 , and TiO 2 were recorded to investigate the efficiency of carrier transfer and separation (Fig. 6).For all samples, the emission peaks were present at approximately 550 nm, and were attributable to the band gap transition. 43The luminescence intensity of the three catalysts was different, from strong to weak, respectively: TiO 2 4 PtO/TiO 2 4 Pt/TiO 2 .This indicated that the loading of either Pt or PtO was beneficial to the separation of photoelectron-hole pairs.In addition, the loading of Pt nanoparticles had a greater ability to inhibit the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs than compared with loading of PtO, thus increasing the concentration of free electrons and providing more electrons for CO 2 reduction, which can be helpful for the production of CH 4 . The photocurrent response is reflection of the separation property of photogenerated electron and photogenerated hole.The higher the photocurrent, the higher the separation efficiency of photoelectron-hole pairs.As shown in Fig. 7, the photocurrent response exhibited the same trends as the PL emission spectra: the loading of Pt helped to enhance the photocurrent intensity, but the loading of PtO resulted in a weaker enhancement compared to Pt.These results indicated that the loading of Pt increased the concentration of free electrons and accelerated charge separation.Further, EIS Nyquist plots were generated to characterize charge transfer resistance (Fig. 8).The relative size of the radius of the arc on the Nyquist diagram corresponds to the size of the charge transfer resistance and the separation efficiency of the photogenerated electron hole pairs.The smaller the arc radius of the impedance spectrum, the better the separation effect of photogenerated electron-hole pairs.Compared with TiO 2 , Pt/TiO 2 , with the smallest radius, showed the lowest resistance; hence, PtO/TiO 2 , with the largest radius, showed the highest resistance, meaning that Pt loading assisted electron transfer but PtO loading suppressed electron transfer.Therefore, we concluded that Pt/TiO 2 could not only inhibit the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs but also facilitate charge transfer. The first step in CO 2 reduction is the adsorption of CO 2 on the catalyst surface.Therefore, the in-situ FT-IR spectra of CO 2 -carrying water vapor adsorbed on Pt/TiO 2 and PtO/TiO 2 surfaces in the dark for 60 min and under illumination for 60 min were collected (Fig. 10).The peak at 1662 cm A1 was assigned to H 2 O. 44 The peaks at 1595 cm A1 and 1392 cm A1 were attributed to HCO 3 A , which was formed by CO 2 and OH groups on the surface, and the peak at 1489 cm A1 was attributed to CO 3 2A , which was formed by the CO 2 and O groups. 45,46For Pt/ TiO 2 , after irradiation with UV light for 1 h, the IR peak for the CO 2 A species, an important intermediate in CO 2 reduction, was observed at 1714 cm A1 , 44,47 suggesting that CO 2 was successfully adsorbed and activated on the Pt/TiO 2 surface.Meanwhile, HCO 3 A and CO 3 2A clearly increased, indicating that Pt/TiO 2 could further activate and transform CO 2 .However, no obvious peaks at 1489 cm A1 and 1392 cm A1 were observed in the spectrum of PtO/TiO 2 , and the peak of CO 2 A was hard to observe, suggesting that the activation and conversion of CO 2 over PtO/ TiO 2 did not occur as easily as over Pt/TiO 2 . It is known that the selectivity of CO 2 reduction is greatly affected by the chemical state of the metal cocatalysts.The Pt 4f XPS spectra of Pt/TiO 2 (Fig. 9a) and PtO/TiO 2 (Fig. 9b) before and after CO 2 photoreduction experiments were recorded and compared.The results showed that the chemical state of the Pt species did not change after the reaction, which eliminated the possibility that the reversed product selectivity was caused by a change in the chemical state of Pt during the photoreduction of CO 2 . To further study the effect of platinum valence states on the hydrogenation of CO 2 to methane, H 2 -TPR experiments were conducted (Fig. 11).A strong peak appeared at 332 1C in the profile of the Pt/TiO 2 catalyst; this peak was attributable to the reduction of TiO 2 near Pt particles by H 2 , assisted by Pt, 48 indicating that Pt could effectively activate the catalyst surface, allowing the easy adsorption and dissociation of H 2 on the surface of Pt/TiO 2 .In comparison, there was a weak peak in the TPR profile of the PtO/TiO 2 catalyst at 314 1C, indicating that it was hard for H 2 to adsorb and dissociate on PtO/TiO 2 .Therefore, in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 , as H will readily form H 2 and then desorb from the PtO/TiO 2 surface when reduced, 49 the H 2 back-reaction is suppressed on PtO/TiO 2 , thereby not only promoting H 2 production but also inhibiting hydrogenation of CO 2 .In contrast, on the Pt/TiO 2 surface, the presence of Pt keeps Fig. 9 The IR spectra of CO 2 and water co-adsorbed on PtO/TiO 2 and Pt/TiO 2 . reduced H atoms on the Pt surface, which favors the participation of hydrogen in the hydrogenation of CO 2 to methane. For the solid-gas reaction, the main product of CO 2 reduction is CO, rather than CH 4 , owing to the high energy barrier and the increased number of carriers and protons needed during CH 4 formation.As the key intermediate during the process, the further reduction of CO is crucial to the product selectivity change of Pt and PtO as co-catalysts in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 . 50,51To further explore the mechanism, TPD and in situ DRIFTS were used to analyze CO. CO-TPD was performed to study the adsorption of CO on Pt/TiO 2 and PtO/TiO 2 .The results in Fig. 12 show that Pt/TiO 2 had significantly larger CO chemisorption capacity than PtO/ TiO 2 as determined from the area of CO desorption peaks.Notably, the CO desorption on Pt/TiO 2 peaked at approximately 152 1C, but that on PtO/TiO 2 began to flatten out at approximately 110 1C, demonstrating that CO adsorption on Pt/TiO 2 was stronger than that on PtO/TiO 2 .This suggested that Pt/TiO 2 favored the further reduction of CO to CH 4 .This may be because the highly dispersed PtO particles, which were smaller, occupied more adsorption sites on the TiO 2 surface, whereas Pt particles migrated and aggregated during the photochemical reduction of PtO into Pt, re-exposing the adsorption sites on the catalyst surface. 52O-FTIR analysis was also performed to provide further understanding of the adsorption sites of CO on Pt/TiO 2 and PtO/TiO 2 .The IR spectra of CO adsorbed on the surface of PtO/ TiO 2 and Pt/TiO 2 are shown in Fig. 13.The bands for linearly adsorbed CO were observed at 2091 cm A1 and 2070 cm A1 , corresponding to Pt terrace sites and low-coordination sites, respectively, and the band for bridge-type adsorbed CO was observed at 1853 cm A1 .53,54 The intensity ratio of IR peaks for linear-type to bridge-type was 1.7 : 1 for Pt/TiO 2 and 1.2 : 1 for PtO/TiO 2 , indicating that linearly coordinated CO could form more easily on the surface of Pt than PtO co-catalysts.In addition, it is well known that the low-coordination sites can more easily activate the reactants, acting as a trap for electrons and facilitating the photocatalytic reduction of CO. 20 Compared with Pt/TiO 2 , no significant enhancement was observed for the IR peak of CO adsorbed on the Pt terrace sites of PtO/TiO 2 despite the larger quantity and smaller size of PtO particles compared with Pt particles; this may have been due to the overstabilization of the Pt atoms by coordination with the oxygen in PtO/TiO 2 , 52 resulting in the deactivation of this site and the inhibition of further CO reduction. To explore how the relative activity of metallic Pt and oxidized Pt species affects CO reduction, the CO adsorption energies on the surface platinum atom of Pt 8 O 8 /TiO 2 (101) and Pt 12 /TiO 2 (101) were calculated.The Pt 12 cluster and Pt 8 O 8 cluster supported by the TiO 2 (101) surface were selected to simulate these two co-catalysts (Fig. S2,ESI ).The number of Pt atoms in the cluster was determined from the distribution and particle size obtained by TEM (Fig. 4), and the adsorption sites were determined by CO-FTIR (Fig. 13).All the successful adsorption structures of CO on Pt 8 O 8 /TiO 2 (101) and Pt 12 / TiO 2 (101) are shown in Fig. S3 and S4 (ESI ); the adsorption energy and Mulliken charges are listed in order in Table S1 (ESI ).The most stable sites are listed separately (Fig. 14 and Table 1), and further partial density of states (PDOS) analysis of CO adsorption was conducted for these sites.As shown in Table 1, the CO adsorption energy on Pt/TiO 2 was higher than that on PtO/TiO 2 at the top site and bridge site, respectively, suggesting that the adsorption of CO on metallic Pt was stronger than that of oxidized Pt species. The enhancement of CO adsorption ability by Pt and PtO was further examined by analysis of the PDOS of CO adsorbed on the Pt 8 O 8 /TiO 2 (101) and Pt 12 /TiO 2 (101) surfaces, as shown in Fig. 15, as well as the Mulliken charges listed in Table 3.As shown in Fig. 15, compared with free CO, in the PDOS of CO adsorption on these two models, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals of CO shifted down toward the Fermi energy level, demonstrating electron transfer from PtO and Pt clusters to CO.Even more remarkable was the more intense hybridization near the Fermi energy level in the PDOS of CO on Pt/TiO 2 , suggesting that the Pt cluster had a greater ability to transfer electrons to CO, corresponding to the more negative Mulliken charges of adsorbed CO, which were A0.19e A and A0.34e A at the top site and bridge site, respectively, whereas those of CO adsorbed on the PtO cluster were A0.08e A and A0.21e A , respectively (Table 3).The results provide a good explanation for the 1.36 eV and 1.38 eV higher CO adsorption energy on the Pt/TiO 2 surface at the top and bridge sites, respectively, than on the PtO/TiO 2 surface.Furthermore, from the PDOS (Fig. 15b) and Mulliken charges (Table 3), more electrons on the Pt/TiO 2 surface at the top site are donated to CO as compared with the bridge site, indicating that there were stronger electronic interactions between CO and the Pt/TiO 2 surface at the top site, providing good support of the results of CO-FTIR.hydrogenation of CO 2 .In contrast, for Pt/TiO 2 , it is difficult to desorb CO from Pt owing to the strong adsorption ability and electronic interactions, and H can remain adsorbed on the Pt surface after being reduced, further hydrogenating CO to CH 4 (Fig. 16)."}, {"llm generation": "PtO/TiO 2 and Pt/TiO 2", "source": "PtO/TiO 2 and Pt/TiO 2 catalysts were prepared to investigate the effect of chemical states of Pt on the product selectivity of CO 2 photoreduction.", "context": "PtO/TiO 2 and Pt/TiO 2 catalysts were prepared to investigate the effect of chemical states of Pt on the product selectivity of CO 2 photoreduction.Compared with PtO, the Pt nanoparticles were larger, and there were fewer particles.PtO/TiO 2 showed good selectivity for CO (100) whereas Pt/TiO 2 favored the production of CH 4 (66.6).This reversed product selectivity was found to result from charge separation and the adsorption/ desorption of CO and H on the catalysts, which were mainly dependent on the oxidation state of the Pt nanoparticles on TiO 2 .Electrochemical and PL analysis showed that Pt loading was conducive to an improvement in the efficiency of photogenerated carrier separation and the concentration of free electrons, which helps the processing of multi-electron reduction reactions, such as CH 4 formation.CO-TPD analysis indicated that metallic Pt had more CO adsorption sites and stronger adsorption capacity, and these findings were verified by comparing the CO adsorption energies using DFT calculations.More specifically, in situ CO 2 /CO-FTIR experiments showed that metallic Pt could promote the conversion of CO 2 to CO 2 A efficiently in the first step of CO 2 reduction and helped the formation of a linear CO adsorption structure at the top sites.As a result, the intensity ratio of IR peaks between the linear type to the bridge type was 1.7 : 1 on Pt/TiO 2 , but 1.2 : 1 for PtO/TiO 2 .Furthermore, Mulliken charges and PDOS analysis indicated intense hybridization of CO electron orbitals on the Pt/TiO 2 surface, especially at the top sites rather than the bridge sites, which indicated that the top site was more favorable for the subsequent CO reduction reactions.In addition, H 2 -TPR experiments proved that the hydrogen atoms were easily adsorbed on the surface of Pt/TiO 2 , which also favors the reduction of CO to CH 4 .Consequently, CH 4 production was favored with Pt/TiO 2 catalysts, whereas CO production was favored with PtO/TiO 2 catalysts.

In the photoreduction of CO 2 , CO 2 with H 2 O was first adsorbed on the active sites on the PtO/TiO 2 and Pt/TiO 2 surfaces to reach an equilibrium state, with the concurrent gradual formation of CO was more easily desorbed from the surface owing to its weak adsorption on PtO/TiO 2 , resulting in a decrease in the number of CO molecules involved in the subsequent reductions.Further, as H formed by H 2 O on the surface of the catalyst could easily form H 2 when it gained electrons and then desorbed from the surface, the H 2 back-reaction on PtO/TiO 2 was suppressed, which not only promoted the formation of H 2 but inhibited the adsorption energies and Mulliken charge of CO on Pt 8 O 8 / TiO 2 (101) and Pt 12 /TiO 2 (101) surfaces Fig. 16 Schematic diagram of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction process with Pt/TiO 2 and PtO/TiO 2 .Red, orange and blue balls represent O, C, and H atoms, respectively.

In situ Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) spectra were collected using a Nicolet iS50 spectrometer (Thermo Fisher) with a Praying Mantis DRIFTS accessory.The IR reaction cell (Harrick Scientific, HVC-DRP) was equipped with two ZnSe windows and a quartz window for IR-and UV-light transmission.A 300 W Xe lamp was used as the UV-light source.First, the baseline was collected after continuous introduction of ultrapure N 2 gas into the reactor cell filled with sample for at least 30 min. In a typical humidified CO 2 photoreduction IR experiment, humidified CO 2 vapor was introduced to the IR reaction cell for 60 min, and the signal was collected.Then, the light source was switched on and the signal was recorded after irradiation for 60 min. In a typical CO adsorption IR experiment, the sample was exposed to 1 CO/N 2 flow for 30 min, and purged again with N 2 for another 30 min until the gas phase CO signal was completely reduced and the catalyst surface adsorption spectra showed no obvious differences between the IR scans.Afterwards, CO adsorption spectra were collected. All photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurements were performed using a standard three-electrode electrochemical workstation (CHI770E) consisting of platinum foil as the counter electrode, ITO coated with a catalyst as the working electrode, and Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode.A 300 W Xe lamp equipped with an AM1.5 filter was used as the irradiation source and 0.5 M aqueous Na 2 SO 4 solution was used as the electrode.The function of photocurrent density changing with time (J-t) was measured under a fixed bias of 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl.Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed at an amplitude of 5 mV and a frequency range of 0.01-100 kHz. CO 2 photocatalytic reduction CO 2 photocatalytic reduction experiments were conducted at 15 1C under UV-light irradiation in an internal circulated reaction system, as reported in our previous work. 33A 300 W Xe lamp was employed to supply the UV light irradiation (300 nm o l o 400 nm, 20 mW cm A2 ).Typically, 20 mg of catalyst in a Petri dish (diameter, 40 mm) and 5 mL of deionized water were added to the bottom of the reactor.After the system was placed under vacuum, ultrapure CO 2 (99.999) was injected to pressurize the reaction system to 71 kPa. A GC equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID), a thermal conductivity detector (TCD), and a methanizer was employed to analyze the concentrations of H 2 , CO, CH 4 , and hydrocarbons every hour.Blank experiments with CO 2 , catalyst, and illumination as control variables were performed before the reaction to ensure that the gas components detected by GC all resulted from the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction. CO adsorption on Pt 8 O 8 /TiO 2 (101) and Pt 12 /TiO 2 (101) surfaces in different positions was studied by using periodic density functional theory (DFT). 34,35Generalized gradient approximation (GGA), based on the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional 36 was used for the exchange-correlation energy.The Kohn-Sham one-electron valence states were expanded from a basis of plane waves with an energy cutoff of 450 eV.All calculations were performed by the CASTEP software package.The anatase TiO 2 (101) surface was modeled as a three-layer p(1 A 3) slab, corresponding to 36 TiO 2 unit cells (108 atoms), to which a vacuum layer of 15 A was applied and the top layer of TiO 2 was allowed to relax.Because of the large size of the supercell, Monkhorst Pack mesh with G point k-point sampling in the surface Brillouin zone was used. 37The force convergence criterion in the structural was set to 0.05 eV A A1 .The adsorption energies were calculated using the equation E ads E sys A E iso , where E ads is the adsorption energy, E sys is the calculated total energy of the system, and E iso is the summed energy of the isolated molecule and bare surface."}, {"llm generation": "Solar Simulator", "source": "A 300 W Xe lamp equipped with an AM1.5 filter was used as the irradiation source and 0.5 M aqueous Na 2 SO 4 solution was used as the electrode.", "context": "Synthesis of PtO/TiO 2 .PtO/TiO 2 was prepared by photodeposition.First, 1 g of TiO 2 (P25) was dispersed into 200 mL H 2 PtCl 6 solution (the mass ratio of Pt to TiO 2 was 1), and stirred for 30 min to fully mix the components.The suspension was then irradiated by a Xe lamp under continuously stirring in air.After irradiation for 1 h, the solid samples were centrifuged, washed three times with deionized water, and dried at 60 1C for 12 h to obtain PtO/TiO 2 .

X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of all powder samples were recorded on an Empyrean diffractometer using CuKa radiation (l 0.1542 nm) in the range of 201-801.The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas were obtained from the N 2 adsorptiondesorption isotherms measured at 77 K using a Micrometrics model ASAP 2000 instrument; all samples were degassed at 150 1C and 10 A6 Torr for 3 h prior to the measurement.The concentration of Pt in the catalysts was measured by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) using a SPECTRO ARCOS instrument.The surface atomic composition of the catalysts and the chemical states of Pt were determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) using Shimadzu/KRATOS AXIS-ULTRA DLD-600W equipment with Al/MgKa radiation.Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were recorded using a FEI Tecnai G 2 F30 instrument.Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy was performed using a confocal laser LabRAM HR800 instrument with a 325 nm excitation light source.The UV-vis spectra of the samples were recorded over the wavelength range of 200-800 nm using a Lambda 35 spectrophotometer.Temperature-programmed H 2 reduction (H 2 -TPR) measurements were conducted using an Autochem II 2920 instrument.Temperature-programmed CO desorption (CO-TPD) measurements were conducted using a ChemiSorb 2720 instrument. In situ Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) spectra were collected using a Nicolet iS50 spectrometer (Thermo Fisher) with a Praying Mantis DRIFTS accessory.The IR reaction cell (Harrick Scientific, HVC-DRP) was equipped with two ZnSe windows and a quartz window for IR-and UV-light transmission.A 300 W Xe lamp was used as the UV-light source.First, the baseline was collected after continuous introduction of ultrapure N 2 gas into the reactor cell filled with sample for at least 30 min. In a typical humidified CO 2 photoreduction IR experiment, humidified CO 2 vapor was introduced to the IR reaction cell for 60 min, and the signal was collected.Then, the light source was switched on and the signal was recorded after irradiation for 60 min. In a typical CO adsorption IR experiment, the sample was exposed to 1 CO/N 2 flow for 30 min, and purged again with N 2 for another 30 min until the gas phase CO signal was completely reduced and the catalyst surface adsorption spectra showed no obvious differences between the IR scans.Afterwards, CO adsorption spectra were collected. All photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurements were performed using a standard three-electrode electrochemical workstation (CHI770E) consisting of platinum foil as the counter electrode, ITO coated with a catalyst as the working electrode, and Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode.A 300 W Xe lamp equipped with an AM1.5 filter was used as the irradiation source and 0.5 M aqueous Na 2 SO 4 solution was used as the electrode.The function of photocurrent density changing with time (J-t) was measured under a fixed bias of 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl.Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed at an amplitude of 5 mV and a frequency range of 0.01-100 kHz. CO 2 photocatalytic reduction CO 2 photocatalytic reduction experiments were conducted at 15 1C under UV-light irradiation in an internal circulated reaction system, as reported in our previous work. 33A 300 W Xe lamp was employed to supply the UV light irradiation (300 nm o l o 400 nm, 20 mW cm A2 ).Typically, 20 mg of catalyst in a Petri dish (diameter, 40 mm) and 5 mL of deionized water were added to the bottom of the reactor.After the system was placed under vacuum, ultrapure CO 2 (99.999) was injected to pressurize the reaction system to 71 kPa. A GC equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID), a thermal conductivity detector (TCD), and a methanizer was employed to analyze the concentrations of H 2 , CO, CH 4 , and hydrocarbons every hour.Blank experiments with CO 2 , catalyst, and illumination as control variables were performed before the reaction to ensure that the gas components detected by GC all resulted from the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction. CO adsorption on Pt 8 O 8 /TiO 2 (101) and Pt 12 /TiO 2 (101) surfaces in different positions was studied by using periodic density functional theory (DFT). 34,35Generalized gradient approximation (GGA), based on the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional 36 was used for the exchange-correlation energy.The Kohn-Sham one-electron valence states were expanded from a basis of plane waves with an energy cutoff of 450 eV.All calculations were performed by the CASTEP software package.The anatase TiO 2 (101) surface was modeled as a three-layer p(1 A 3) slab, corresponding to 36 TiO 2 unit cells (108 atoms), to which a vacuum layer of 15 A was applied and the top layer of TiO 2 was allowed to relax.Because of the large size of the supercell, Monkhorst Pack mesh with G point k-point sampling in the surface Brillouin zone was used. 37The force convergence criterion in the structural was set to 0.05 eV A A1 .The adsorption energies were calculated using the equation E ads E sys A E iso , where E ads is the adsorption energy, E sys is the calculated total energy of the system, and E iso is the summed energy of the isolated molecule and bare surface. The cumulative production of CH 4 , CO, and H 2 after UV irradiation for 8 h with PtO/TiO 2 , Pt/TiO 2 , and TiO 2 as catalysts, is presented in Fig. 1 and Table 1.Production over PtO/TiO 2 and Pt/TiO 2 was increased compared over TiO 2 , but an even more noticeable difference was the different product selectivity of the catalysts.The selectivity of both TiO 2 and PtO/TiO 2 for CH 4 was very poor.When PtO was loaded onto TiO 2 , the yield of CO and H 2 increased significantly, by 43 and 47, respectively, indicating that PtO loading could facilitate the generation of CO and H 2 .However, for Pt/TiO 2 , CH 4 was produced and the yield reached 3.99 mmol g A1 , while the production of CO was suppressed, indicating good selectivity for CH 4 .The cycling performance was analyzed to investigate the stability of PtO/TiO 2 and Pt/TiO 2 .As shown in Fig. S1 (ESI ), after 3 cycles over a total of 24 h, the total production has decreased by approximately 11 and 16, respectively, demonstrating a good stability and sustainability.The reduction of CO 2 to CH 4 requires more electrons and protons than the production of CO.Therefore, to explore the reasons for the reversed selectivity -that is, after the reduction of PtO to Pt, the dominant product of photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 over the catalyst changes from CO to CH 4 -the physicochemical properties of the catalysts were analyzed. The XRD patterns (Fig. 2) showed that Pt and PtO loading did not change the crystal structure of TiO 2 .The peaks marked A are the characteristic peaks of anatase, and the peaks marked R are the characteristic peaks of rutile, indicating that the TiO 2 in the three samples existed in a mixed phase of anatase and rutile; these findings were in good agreement with the literature. 38he ICP-OES results, listed in Table 2, confirmed that the Pt concentration of the prepared samples was consistent.The chemical states of the Pt species on the surface of catalysts were analyzed by XPS (Fig. 3a).A pair of peaks corresponding to Pt 2 were clearly observed in the spectra of PtO/TiO 2 at to the binding energies of 72.7 eV and 75.8 eV. 21,22No obvious signal attributable to Pt 0 was observed, indicating that Pt 2 was the dominant Pt species in PtO/TiO 2 .The Pt 4f XPS spectra of Pt/TiO 2 indicated binding energies of 71.0 eV and 74.7 eV corresponding to Pt 0 , accompanied by two weak peaks of Pt 2 , which may have been caused by the oxidation of Pt 0 nanoparticles. 23It is generally believed that the binding energy of Pt 0 as Pt 4f 7/2 is 71.2 eV. 39,40n contrast, the peak in Fig. 3a had a slightly negative deviation, corresponding to the configurations of 2p for Ti (Fig. 3b) and 1s for O (Fig. 3c), which indicated the formation of a heterojunction between TiO 2 and Pt and, consequently, the transfer of electrons from TiO 2 to Pt.The HR-TEM images of PtO/TiO 2 and Pt/TiO 2 are shown in Fig. 4a andf, and the size of the loaded particles is listed in Table 2.For PtO/TiO 2 , ultrafine PtO nanoparticles (average size 0.9 nm) were highly dispersed on the surface of TiO 2 ; in contrast, for Pt/TiO 2 , the Pt nanoparticles obtained by PtO reduction were clearly larger (average size 1.9 nm) and there were fewer particles.In addition, the size distribution of PtO particles was much narrower than that of Pt particles.These findings indicated that Pt nanoparticles migrated and grew up during the photoreduction process of PtO.As shown in the HADDF-STEM images (Fig. 4b andg), the PtO and Pt nanoparticles were distributed evenly on the TiO 2 surface.To further verify the components of PtO/TiO 2 and Pt/TiO 2 , EDX elemental mappings of Ti, O and Pt were investigated by STEM (Fig. 4c-e andh-j).The red and green areas are consistent with TiO 2 in HAADF-STEM images, whereas the yellow areas are consistent with the particles supported on TiO 2 surface.In addition, the XPS spectrum showed that the Pt element exists mainly in the form of Pt 2 in PtO/TiO 2 and Pt 0 in Pt/TiO 2 .Given this information, we can conclude that the particles on the surface of the two catalysts comprised mainly PtO and Pt. The UV-vis absorption spectra of samples are presented in Fig. 5a.The bandgap energy (E g ) was calculated from the formulas, E g 1240/l and (Ahn) n k(hn A E g ), where A is the absorption coefficient, k is a constant, n is 0.5 for semiconductors with an indirect band gap, hn is the energy of absorbed photon, and E g is the band gap energy. 41As shown in Fig. 5b, the bandgap energies of TiO 2 , PtO/TiO 2 , and Pt/TiO 2 were calculated as 3.41 eV, 3.25 eV, and 3.16 eV, respectively.The results showed that Pt and PtO both reduced the band gap of TiO 2 and enhanced the movement of photogenerated carriers; however, Pt resulted in a greater reduction.The reduced bandgap of PtO/TiO 2 and Pt/TiO 2 may be cause by the formation of Pt-O-Pt bonds between PtO and TiO 2 as well as Pt and TiO 2 .Additionally, Pt particles are more active and interact more strongly with TiO 2 , leading to a greater reduction in the TiO 2 bandgap. 42he PL emission spectra of PtO/TiO 2 , Pt/TiO 2 , and TiO 2 were recorded to investigate the efficiency of carrier transfer and separation (Fig. 6).For all samples, the emission peaks were present at approximately 550 nm, and were attributable to the band gap transition. 43The luminescence intensity of the three catalysts was different, from strong to weak, respectively: TiO 2 4 PtO/TiO 2 4 Pt/TiO 2 .This indicated that the loading of either Pt or PtO was beneficial to the separation of photoelectron-hole pairs.In addition, the loading of Pt nanoparticles had a greater ability to inhibit the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs than compared with loading of PtO, thus increasing the concentration of free electrons and providing more electrons for CO 2 reduction, which can be helpful for the production of CH 4 . The photocurrent response is reflection of the separation property of photogenerated electron and photogenerated hole.The higher the photocurrent, the higher the separation efficiency of photoelectron-hole pairs.As shown in Fig. 7, the photocurrent response exhibited the same trends as the PL emission spectra: the loading of Pt helped to enhance the photocurrent intensity, but the loading of PtO resulted in a weaker enhancement compared to Pt.These results indicated that the loading of Pt increased the concentration of free electrons and accelerated charge separation.Further, EIS Nyquist plots were generated to characterize charge transfer resistance (Fig. 8).The relative size of the radius of the arc on the Nyquist diagram corresponds to the size of the charge transfer resistance and the separation efficiency of the photogenerated electron hole pairs.The smaller the arc radius of the impedance spectrum, the better the separation effect of photogenerated electron-hole pairs.Compared with TiO 2 , Pt/TiO 2 , with the smallest radius, showed the lowest resistance; hence, PtO/TiO 2 , with the largest radius, showed the highest resistance, meaning that Pt loading assisted electron transfer but PtO loading suppressed electron transfer.Therefore, we concluded that Pt/TiO 2 could not only inhibit the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs but also facilitate charge transfer. The first step in CO 2 reduction is the adsorption of CO 2 on the catalyst surface.Therefore, the in-situ FT-IR spectra of CO 2 -carrying water vapor adsorbed on Pt/TiO 2 and PtO/TiO 2 surfaces in the dark for 60 min and under illumination for 60 min were collected (Fig. 10).The peak at 1662 cm A1 was assigned to H 2 O. 44 The peaks at 1595 cm A1 and 1392 cm A1 were attributed to HCO 3 A , which was formed by CO 2 and OH groups on the surface, and the peak at 1489 cm A1 was attributed to CO 3 2A , which was formed by the CO 2 and O groups. 45,46For Pt/ TiO 2 , after irradiation with UV light for 1 h, the IR peak for the CO 2 A species, an important intermediate in CO 2 reduction, was observed at 1714 cm A1 , 44,47 suggesting that CO 2 was successfully adsorbed and activated on the Pt/TiO 2 surface.Meanwhile, HCO 3 A and CO 3 2A clearly increased, indicating that Pt/TiO 2 could further activate and transform CO 2 .However, no obvious peaks at 1489 cm A1 and 1392 cm A1 were observed in the spectrum of PtO/TiO 2 , and the peak of CO 2 A was hard to observe, suggesting that the activation and conversion of CO 2 over PtO/ TiO 2 did not occur as easily as over Pt/TiO 2 . It is known that the selectivity of CO 2 reduction is greatly affected by the chemical state of the metal cocatalysts.The Pt 4f XPS spectra of Pt/TiO 2 (Fig. 9a) and PtO/TiO 2 (Fig. 9b) before and after CO 2 photoreduction experiments were recorded and compared.The results showed that the chemical state of the Pt species did not change after the reaction, which eliminated the possibility that the reversed product selectivity was caused by a change in the chemical state of Pt during the photoreduction of CO 2 . To further study the effect of platinum valence states on the hydrogenation of CO 2 to methane, H 2 -TPR experiments were conducted (Fig. 11).A strong peak appeared at 332 1C in the profile of the Pt/TiO 2 catalyst; this peak was attributable to the reduction of TiO 2 near Pt particles by H 2 , assisted by Pt, 48 indicating that Pt could effectively activate the catalyst surface, allowing the easy adsorption and dissociation of H 2 on the surface of Pt/TiO 2 .In comparison, there was a weak peak in the TPR profile of the PtO/TiO 2 catalyst at 314 1C, indicating that it was hard for H 2 to adsorb and dissociate on PtO/TiO 2 .Therefore, in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 , as H will readily form H 2 and then desorb from the PtO/TiO 2 surface when reduced, 49 the H 2 back-reaction is suppressed on PtO/TiO 2 , thereby not only promoting H 2 production but also inhibiting hydrogenation of CO 2 .In contrast, on the Pt/TiO 2 surface, the presence of Pt keeps Fig. 9 The IR spectra of CO 2 and water co-adsorbed on PtO/TiO 2 and Pt/TiO 2 . reduced H atoms on the Pt surface, which favors the participation of hydrogen in the hydrogenation of CO 2 to methane. For the solid-gas reaction, the main product of CO 2 reduction is CO, rather than CH 4 , owing to the high energy barrier and the increased number of carriers and protons needed during CH 4 formation.As the key intermediate during the process, the further reduction of CO is crucial to the product selectivity change of Pt and PtO as co-catalysts in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 . 50,51To further explore the mechanism, TPD and in situ DRIFTS were used to analyze CO. CO-TPD was performed to study the adsorption of CO on Pt/TiO 2 and PtO/TiO 2 .The results in Fig. 12 show that Pt/TiO 2 had significantly larger CO chemisorption capacity than PtO/ TiO 2 as determined from the area of CO desorption peaks.Notably, the CO desorption on Pt/TiO 2 peaked at approximately 152 1C, but that on PtO/TiO 2 began to flatten out at approximately 110 1C, demonstrating that CO adsorption on Pt/TiO 2 was stronger than that on PtO/TiO 2 .This suggested that Pt/TiO 2 favored the further reduction of CO to CH 4 .This may be because the highly dispersed PtO particles, which were smaller, occupied more adsorption sites on the TiO 2 surface, whereas Pt particles migrated and aggregated during the photochemical reduction of PtO into Pt, re-exposing the adsorption sites on the catalyst surface. 52O-FTIR analysis was also performed to provide further understanding of the adsorption sites of CO on Pt/TiO 2 and PtO/TiO 2 .The IR spectra of CO adsorbed on the surface of PtO/ TiO 2 and Pt/TiO 2 are shown in Fig. 13.The bands for linearly adsorbed CO were observed at 2091 cm A1 and 2070 cm A1 , corresponding to Pt terrace sites and low-coordination sites, respectively, and the band for bridge-type adsorbed CO was observed at 1853 cm A1 .53,54 The intensity ratio of IR peaks for linear-type to bridge-type was 1.7 : 1 for Pt/TiO 2 and 1.2 : 1 for PtO/TiO 2 , indicating that linearly coordinated CO could form more easily on the surface of Pt than PtO co-catalysts.In addition, it is well known that the low-coordination sites can more easily activate the reactants, acting as a trap for electrons and facilitating the photocatalytic reduction of CO. 20 Compared with Pt/TiO 2 , no significant enhancement was observed for the IR peak of CO adsorbed on the Pt terrace sites of PtO/TiO 2 despite the larger quantity and smaller size of PtO particles compared with Pt particles; this may have been due to the overstabilization of the Pt atoms by coordination with the oxygen in PtO/TiO 2 , 52 resulting in the deactivation of this site and the inhibition of further CO reduction. To explore how the relative activity of metallic Pt and oxidized Pt species affects CO reduction, the CO adsorption energies on the surface platinum atom of Pt 8 O 8 /TiO 2 (101) and Pt 12 /TiO 2 (101) were calculated.The Pt 12 cluster and Pt 8 O 8 cluster supported by the TiO 2 (101) surface were selected to simulate these two co-catalysts (Fig. S2,ESI ).The number of Pt atoms in the cluster was determined from the distribution and particle size obtained by TEM (Fig. 4), and the adsorption sites were determined by CO-FTIR (Fig. 13).All the successful adsorption structures of CO on Pt 8 O 8 /TiO 2 (101) and Pt 12 / TiO 2 (101) are shown in Fig. S3 and S4 (ESI ); the adsorption energy and Mulliken charges are listed in order in Table S1 (ESI ).The most stable sites are listed separately (Fig. 14 and Table 1), and further partial density of states (PDOS) analysis of CO adsorption was conducted for these sites.As shown in Table 1, the CO adsorption energy on Pt/TiO 2 was higher than that on PtO/TiO 2 at the top site and bridge site, respectively, suggesting that the adsorption of CO on metallic Pt was stronger than that of oxidized Pt species. The enhancement of CO adsorption ability by Pt and PtO was further examined by analysis of the PDOS of CO adsorbed on the Pt 8 O 8 /TiO 2 (101) and Pt 12 /TiO 2 (101) surfaces, as shown in Fig. 15, as well as the Mulliken charges listed in Table 3.As shown in Fig. 15, compared with free CO, in the PDOS of CO adsorption on these two models, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals of CO shifted down toward the Fermi energy level, demonstrating electron transfer from PtO and Pt clusters to CO.Even more remarkable was the more intense hybridization near the Fermi energy level in the PDOS of CO on Pt/TiO 2 , suggesting that the Pt cluster had a greater ability to transfer electrons to CO, corresponding to the more negative Mulliken charges of adsorbed CO, which were A0.19e A and A0.34e A at the top site and bridge site, respectively, whereas those of CO adsorbed on the PtO cluster were A0.08e A and A0.21e A , respectively (Table 3).The results provide a good explanation for the 1.36 eV and 1.38 eV higher CO adsorption energy on the Pt/TiO 2 surface at the top and bridge sites, respectively, than on the PtO/TiO 2 surface.Furthermore, from the PDOS (Fig. 15b) and Mulliken charges (Table 3), more electrons on the Pt/TiO 2 surface at the top site are donated to CO as compared with the bridge site, indicating that there were stronger electronic interactions between CO and the Pt/TiO 2 surface at the top site, providing good support of the results of CO-FTIR.hydrogenation of CO 2 .In contrast, for Pt/TiO 2 , it is difficult to desorb CO from Pt owing to the strong adsorption ability and electronic interactions, and H can remain adsorbed on the Pt surface after being reduced, further hydrogenating CO to CH 4 (Fig. 16)."}, {"llm generation": "UV-Vis", "source": "Fig. 5 (a) UV-vis spectra and (b) band gap of TiO 2 , Pt/TiO 2 and PtO/TiO 2 .", "context": "PtO/TiO 2 and Pt/TiO 2 catalysts were prepared to investigate the effect of chemical states of Pt on the product selectivity of CO 2 photoreduction.Compared with PtO, the Pt nanoparticles were larger, and there were fewer particles.PtO/TiO 2 showed good selectivity for CO (100) whereas Pt/TiO 2 favored the production of CH 4 (66.6).This reversed product selectivity was found to result from charge separation and the adsorption/ desorption of CO and H on the catalysts, which were mainly dependent on the oxidation state of the Pt nanoparticles on TiO 2 .Electrochemical and PL analysis showed that Pt loading was conducive to an improvement in the efficiency of photogenerated carrier separation and the concentration of free electrons, which helps the processing of multi-electron reduction reactions, such as CH 4 formation.CO-TPD analysis indicated that metallic Pt had more CO adsorption sites and stronger adsorption capacity, and these findings were verified by comparing the CO adsorption energies using DFT calculations.More specifically, in situ CO 2 /CO-FTIR experiments showed that metallic Pt could promote the conversion of CO 2 to CO 2 A efficiently in the first step of CO 2 reduction and helped the formation of a linear CO adsorption structure at the top sites.As a result, the intensity ratio of IR peaks between the linear type to the bridge type was 1.7 : 1 on Pt/TiO 2 , but 1.2 : 1 for PtO/TiO 2 .Furthermore, Mulliken charges and PDOS analysis indicated intense hybridization of CO electron orbitals on the Pt/TiO 2 surface, especially at the top sites rather than the bridge sites, which indicated that the top site was more favorable for the subsequent CO reduction reactions.In addition, H 2 -TPR experiments proved that the hydrogen atoms were easily adsorbed on the surface of Pt/TiO 2 , which also favors the reduction of CO to CH 4 .Consequently, CH 4 production was favored with Pt/TiO 2 catalysts, whereas CO production was favored with PtO/TiO 2 catalysts.

In the photoreduction of CO 2 , CO 2 with H 2 O was first adsorbed on the active sites on the PtO/TiO 2 and Pt/TiO 2 surfaces to reach an equilibrium state, with the concurrent gradual formation of CO was more easily desorbed from the surface owing to its weak adsorption on PtO/TiO 2 , resulting in a decrease in the number of CO molecules involved in the subsequent reductions.Further, as H formed by H 2 O on the surface of the catalyst could easily form H 2 when it gained electrons and then desorbed from the surface, the H 2 back-reaction on PtO/TiO 2 was suppressed, which not only promoted the formation of H 2 but inhibited the adsorption energies and Mulliken charge of CO on Pt 8 O 8 / TiO 2 (101) and Pt 12 /TiO 2 (101) surfaces Fig. 16 Schematic diagram of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction process with Pt/TiO 2 and PtO/TiO 2 .Red, orange and blue balls represent O, C, and H atoms, respectively.

The cumulative production of CH 4 , CO, and H 2 after UV irradiation for 8 h with PtO/TiO 2 , Pt/TiO 2 , and TiO 2 as catalysts, is presented in Fig. 1 and Table 1.Production over PtO/TiO 2 and Pt/TiO 2 was increased compared over TiO 2 , but an even more noticeable difference was the different product selectivity of the catalysts.The selectivity of both TiO 2 and PtO/TiO 2 for CH 4 was very poor.When PtO was loaded onto TiO 2 , the yield of CO and H 2 increased significantly, by 43 and 47, respectively, indicating that PtO loading could facilitate the generation of CO and H 2 .However, for Pt/TiO 2 , CH 4 was produced and the yield reached 3.99 mmol g A1 , while the production of CO was suppressed, indicating good selectivity for CH 4 .The cycling performance was analyzed to investigate the stability of PtO/TiO 2 and Pt/TiO 2 .As shown in Fig. S1 (ESI ), after 3 cycles over a total of 24 h, the total production has decreased by approximately 11 and 16, respectively, demonstrating a good stability and sustainability.The reduction of CO 2 to CH 4 requires more electrons and protons than the production of CO.Therefore, to explore the reasons for the reversed selectivity -that is, after the reduction of PtO to Pt, the dominant product of photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 over the catalyst changes from CO to CH 4 -the physicochemical properties of the catalysts were analyzed. The XRD patterns (Fig. 2) showed that Pt and PtO loading did not change the crystal structure of TiO 2 .The peaks marked A are the characteristic peaks of anatase, and the peaks marked R are the characteristic peaks of rutile, indicating that the TiO 2 in the three samples existed in a mixed phase of anatase and rutile; these findings were in good agreement with the literature. 38he ICP-OES results, listed in Table 2, confirmed that the Pt concentration of the prepared samples was consistent.The chemical states of the Pt species on the surface of catalysts were analyzed by XPS (Fig. 3a).A pair of peaks corresponding to Pt 2 were clearly observed in the spectra of PtO/TiO 2 at to the binding energies of 72.7 eV and 75.8 eV. 21,22No obvious signal attributable to Pt 0 was observed, indicating that Pt 2 was the dominant Pt species in PtO/TiO 2 .The Pt 4f XPS spectra of Pt/TiO 2 indicated binding energies of 71.0 eV and 74.7 eV corresponding to Pt 0 , accompanied by two weak peaks of Pt 2 , which may have been caused by the oxidation of Pt 0 nanoparticles. 23It is generally believed that the binding energy of Pt 0 as Pt 4f 7/2 is 71.2 eV. 39,40n contrast, the peak in Fig. 3a had a slightly negative deviation, corresponding to the configurations of 2p for Ti (Fig. 3b) and 1s for O (Fig. 3c), which indicated the formation of a heterojunction between TiO 2 and Pt and, consequently, the transfer of electrons from TiO 2 to Pt.The HR-TEM images of PtO/TiO 2 and Pt/TiO 2 are shown in Fig. 4a andf, and the size of the loaded particles is listed in Table 2.For PtO/TiO 2 , ultrafine PtO nanoparticles (average size 0.9 nm) were highly dispersed on the surface of TiO 2 ; in contrast, for Pt/TiO 2 , the Pt nanoparticles obtained by PtO reduction were clearly larger (average size 1.9 nm) and there were fewer particles.In addition, the size distribution of PtO particles was much narrower than that of Pt particles.These findings indicated that Pt nanoparticles migrated and grew up during the photoreduction process of PtO.As shown in the HADDF-STEM images (Fig. 4b andg), the PtO and Pt nanoparticles were distributed evenly on the TiO 2 surface.To further verify the components of PtO/TiO 2 and Pt/TiO 2 , EDX elemental mappings of Ti, O and Pt were investigated by STEM (Fig. 4c-e andh-j).The red and green areas are consistent with TiO 2 in HAADF-STEM images, whereas the yellow areas are consistent with the particles supported on TiO 2 surface.In addition, the XPS spectrum showed that the Pt element exists mainly in the form of Pt 2 in PtO/TiO 2 and Pt 0 in Pt/TiO 2 .Given this information, we can conclude that the particles on the surface of the two catalysts comprised mainly PtO and Pt. The UV-vis absorption spectra of samples are presented in Fig. 5a.The bandgap energy (E g ) was calculated from the formulas, E g 1240/l and (Ahn) n k(hn A E g ), where A is the absorption coefficient, k is a constant, n is 0.5 for semiconductors with an indirect band gap, hn is the energy of absorbed photon, and E g is the band gap energy. 41As shown in Fig. 5b, the bandgap energies of TiO 2 , PtO/TiO 2 , and Pt/TiO 2 were calculated as 3.41 eV, 3.25 eV, and 3.16 eV, respectively.The results showed that Pt and PtO both reduced the band gap of TiO 2 and enhanced the movement of photogenerated carriers; however, Pt resulted in a greater reduction.The reduced bandgap of PtO/TiO 2 and Pt/TiO 2 may be cause by the formation of Pt-O-Pt bonds between PtO and TiO 2 as well as Pt and TiO 2 .Additionally, Pt particles are more active and interact more strongly with TiO 2 , leading to a greater reduction in the TiO 2 bandgap. 42he PL emission spectra of PtO/TiO 2 , Pt/TiO 2 , and TiO 2 were recorded to investigate the efficiency of carrier transfer and separation (Fig. 6).For all samples, the emission peaks were present at approximately 550 nm, and were attributable to the band gap transition. 43The luminescence intensity of the three catalysts was different, from strong to weak, respectively: TiO 2 4 PtO/TiO 2 4 Pt/TiO 2 .This indicated that the loading of either Pt or PtO was beneficial to the separation of photoelectron-hole pairs.In addition, the loading of Pt nanoparticles had a greater ability to inhibit the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs than compared with loading of PtO, thus increasing the concentration of free electrons and providing more electrons for CO 2 reduction, which can be helpful for the production of CH 4 . The photocurrent response is reflection of the separation property of photogenerated electron and photogenerated hole.The higher the photocurrent, the higher the separation efficiency of photoelectron-hole pairs.As shown in Fig. 7, the photocurrent response exhibited the same trends as the PL emission spectra: the loading of Pt helped to enhance the photocurrent intensity, but the loading of PtO resulted in a weaker enhancement compared to Pt.These results indicated that the loading of Pt increased the concentration of free electrons and accelerated charge separation.Further, EIS Nyquist plots were generated to characterize charge transfer resistance (Fig. 8).The relative size of the radius of the arc on the Nyquist diagram corresponds to the size of the charge transfer resistance and the separation efficiency of the photogenerated electron hole pairs.The smaller the arc radius of the impedance spectrum, the better the separation effect of photogenerated electron-hole pairs.Compared with TiO 2 , Pt/TiO 2 , with the smallest radius, showed the lowest resistance; hence, PtO/TiO 2 , with the largest radius, showed the highest resistance, meaning that Pt loading assisted electron transfer but PtO loading suppressed electron transfer.Therefore, we concluded that Pt/TiO 2 could not only inhibit the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs but also facilitate charge transfer. The first step in CO 2 reduction is the adsorption of CO 2 on the catalyst surface.Therefore, the in-situ FT-IR spectra of CO 2 -carrying water vapor adsorbed on Pt/TiO 2 and PtO/TiO 2 surfaces in the dark for 60 min and under illumination for 60 min were collected (Fig. 10).The peak at 1662 cm A1 was assigned to H 2 O. 44 The peaks at 1595 cm A1 and 1392 cm A1 were attributed to HCO 3 A , which was formed by CO 2 and OH groups on the surface, and the peak at 1489 cm A1 was attributed to CO 3 2A , which was formed by the CO 2 and O groups. 45,46For Pt/ TiO 2 , after irradiation with UV light for 1 h, the IR peak for the CO 2 A species, an important intermediate in CO 2 reduction, was observed at 1714 cm A1 , 44,47 suggesting that CO 2 was successfully adsorbed and activated on the Pt/TiO 2 surface.Meanwhile, HCO 3 A and CO 3 2A clearly increased, indicating that Pt/TiO 2 could further activate and transform CO 2 .However, no obvious peaks at 1489 cm A1 and 1392 cm A1 were observed in the spectrum of PtO/TiO 2 , and the peak of CO 2 A was hard to observe, suggesting that the activation and conversion of CO 2 over PtO/ TiO 2 did not occur as easily as over Pt/TiO 2 . It is known that the selectivity of CO 2 reduction is greatly affected by the chemical state of the metal cocatalysts.The Pt 4f XPS spectra of Pt/TiO 2 (Fig. 9a) and PtO/TiO 2 (Fig. 9b) before and after CO 2 photoreduction experiments were recorded and compared.The results showed that the chemical state of the Pt species did not change after the reaction, which eliminated the possibility that the reversed product selectivity was caused by a change in the chemical state of Pt during the photoreduction of CO 2 . To further study the effect of platinum valence states on the hydrogenation of CO 2 to methane, H 2 -TPR experiments were conducted (Fig. 11).A strong peak appeared at 332 1C in the profile of the Pt/TiO 2 catalyst; this peak was attributable to the reduction of TiO 2 near Pt particles by H 2 , assisted by Pt, 48 indicating that Pt could effectively activate the catalyst surface, allowing the easy adsorption and dissociation of H 2 on the surface of Pt/TiO 2 .In comparison, there was a weak peak in the TPR profile of the PtO/TiO 2 catalyst at 314 1C, indicating that it was hard for H 2 to adsorb and dissociate on PtO/TiO 2 .Therefore, in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 , as H will readily form H 2 and then desorb from the PtO/TiO 2 surface when reduced, 49 the H 2 back-reaction is suppressed on PtO/TiO 2 , thereby not only promoting H 2 production but also inhibiting hydrogenation of CO 2 .In contrast, on the Pt/TiO 2 surface, the presence of Pt keeps Fig. 9 The IR spectra of CO 2 and water co-adsorbed on PtO/TiO 2 and Pt/TiO 2 . reduced H atoms on the Pt surface, which favors the participation of hydrogen in the hydrogenation of CO 2 to methane. For the solid-gas reaction, the main product of CO 2 reduction is CO, rather than CH 4 , owing to the high energy barrier and the increased number of carriers and protons needed during CH 4 formation.As the key intermediate during the process, the further reduction of CO is crucial to the product selectivity change of Pt and PtO as co-catalysts in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 . 50,51To further explore the mechanism, TPD and in situ DRIFTS were used to analyze CO. CO-TPD was performed to study the adsorption of CO on Pt/TiO 2 and PtO/TiO 2 .The results in Fig. 12 show that Pt/TiO 2 had significantly larger CO chemisorption capacity than PtO/ TiO 2 as determined from the area of CO desorption peaks.Notably, the CO desorption on Pt/TiO 2 peaked at approximately 152 1C, but that on PtO/TiO 2 began to flatten out at approximately 110 1C, demonstrating that CO adsorption on Pt/TiO 2 was stronger than that on PtO/TiO 2 .This suggested that Pt/TiO 2 favored the further reduction of CO to CH 4 .This may be because the highly dispersed PtO particles, which were smaller, occupied more adsorption sites on the TiO 2 surface, whereas Pt particles migrated and aggregated during the photochemical reduction of PtO into Pt, re-exposing the adsorption sites on the catalyst surface. 52O-FTIR analysis was also performed to provide further understanding of the adsorption sites of CO on Pt/TiO 2 and PtO/TiO 2 .The IR spectra of CO adsorbed on the surface of PtO/ TiO 2 and Pt/TiO 2 are shown in Fig. 13.The bands for linearly adsorbed CO were observed at 2091 cm A1 and 2070 cm A1 , corresponding to Pt terrace sites and low-coordination sites, respectively, and the band for bridge-type adsorbed CO was observed at 1853 cm A1 .53,54 The intensity ratio of IR peaks for linear-type to bridge-type was 1.7 : 1 for Pt/TiO 2 and 1.2 : 1 for PtO/TiO 2 , indicating that linearly coordinated CO could form more easily on the surface of Pt than PtO co-catalysts.In addition, it is well known that the low-coordination sites can more easily activate the reactants, acting as a trap for electrons and facilitating the photocatalytic reduction of CO. 20 Compared with Pt/TiO 2 , no significant enhancement was observed for the IR peak of CO adsorbed on the Pt terrace sites of PtO/TiO 2 despite the larger quantity and smaller size of PtO particles compared with Pt particles; this may have been due to the overstabilization of the Pt atoms by coordination with the oxygen in PtO/TiO 2 , 52 resulting in the deactivation of this site and the inhibition of further CO reduction. To explore how the relative activity of metallic Pt and oxidized Pt species affects CO reduction, the CO adsorption energies on the surface platinum atom of Pt 8 O 8 /TiO 2 (101) and Pt 12 /TiO 2 (101) were calculated.The Pt 12 cluster and Pt 8 O 8 cluster supported by the TiO 2 (101) surface were selected to simulate these two co-catalysts (Fig. S2,ESI ).The number of Pt atoms in the cluster was determined from the distribution and particle size obtained by TEM (Fig. 4), and the adsorption sites were determined by CO-FTIR (Fig. 13).All the successful adsorption structures of CO on Pt 8 O 8 /TiO 2 (101) and Pt 12 / TiO 2 (101) are shown in Fig. S3 and S4 (ESI ); the adsorption energy and Mulliken charges are listed in order in Table S1 (ESI ).The most stable sites are listed separately (Fig. 14 and Table 1), and further partial density of states (PDOS) analysis of CO adsorption was conducted for these sites.As shown in Table 1, the CO adsorption energy on Pt/TiO 2 was higher than that on PtO/TiO 2 at the top site and bridge site, respectively, suggesting that the adsorption of CO on metallic Pt was stronger than that of oxidized Pt species. The enhancement of CO adsorption ability by Pt and PtO was further examined by analysis of the PDOS of CO adsorbed on the Pt 8 O 8 /TiO 2 (101) and Pt 12 /TiO 2 (101) surfaces, as shown in Fig. 15, as well as the Mulliken charges listed in Table 3.As shown in Fig. 15, compared with free CO, in the PDOS of CO adsorption on these two models, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals of CO shifted down toward the Fermi energy level, demonstrating electron transfer from PtO and Pt clusters to CO.Even more remarkable was the more intense hybridization near the Fermi energy level in the PDOS of CO on Pt/TiO 2 , suggesting that the Pt cluster had a greater ability to transfer electrons to CO, corresponding to the more negative Mulliken charges of adsorbed CO, which were A0.19e A and A0.34e A at the top site and bridge site, respectively, whereas those of CO adsorbed on the PtO cluster were A0.08e A and A0.21e A , respectively (Table 3).The results provide a good explanation for the 1.36 eV and 1.38 eV higher CO adsorption energy on the Pt/TiO 2 surface at the top and bridge sites, respectively, than on the PtO/TiO 2 surface.Furthermore, from the PDOS (Fig. 15b) and Mulliken charges (Table 3), more electrons on the Pt/TiO 2 surface at the top site are donated to CO as compared with the bridge site, indicating that there were stronger electronic interactions between CO and the Pt/TiO 2 surface at the top site, providing good support of the results of CO-FTIR.hydrogenation of CO 2 .In contrast, for Pt/TiO 2 , it is difficult to desorb CO from Pt owing to the strong adsorption ability and electronic interactions, and H can remain adsorbed on the Pt surface after being reduced, further hydrogenating CO to CH 4 (Fig. 16)."}], "reaction medium": [{"llm generation": "Liquid", "source": "First, 1 g of TiO 2 (P25) was dispersed into 200 mL H 2 PtCl 6 solution (the mass ratio of Pt to TiO 2 was 1), and stirred for 30 min to fully mix the components.", "context": "Synthesis of PtO/TiO 2 .PtO/TiO 2 was prepared by photodeposition.First, 1 g of TiO 2 (P25) was dispersed into 200 mL H 2 PtCl 6 solution (the mass ratio of Pt to TiO 2 was 1), and stirred for 30 min to fully mix the components.The suspension was then irradiated by a Xe lamp under continuously stirring in air.After irradiation for 1 h, the solid samples were centrifuged, washed three times with deionized water, and dried at 60 1C for 12 h to obtain PtO/TiO 2 .

CO adsorption on Pt 8 O 8 /TiO 2 (101) and Pt 12 /TiO 2 (101) surfaces in different positions was studied by using periodic density functional theory (DFT). 34,35Generalized gradient approximation (GGA), based on the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional 36 was used for the exchange-correlation energy.The Kohn-Sham one-electron valence states were expanded from a basis of plane waves with an energy cutoff of 450 eV.All calculations were performed by the CASTEP software package.The anatase TiO 2 (101) surface was modeled as a three-layer p(1 A 3) slab, corresponding to 36 TiO 2 unit cells (108 atoms), to which a vacuum layer of 15 A was applied and the top layer of TiO 2 was allowed to relax.Because of the large size of the supercell, Monkhorst Pack mesh with G point k-point sampling in the surface Brillouin zone was used. 37The force convergence criterion in the structural was set to 0.05 eV A A1 .The adsorption energies were calculated using the equation E ads E sys A E iso , where E ads is the adsorption energy, E sys is the calculated total energy of the system, and E iso is the summed energy of the isolated molecule and bare surface. The cumulative production of CH 4 , CO, and H 2 after UV irradiation for 8 h with PtO/TiO 2 , Pt/TiO 2 , and TiO 2 as catalysts, is presented in Fig. 1 and Table 1.Production over PtO/TiO 2 and Pt/TiO 2 was increased compared over TiO 2 , but an even more noticeable difference was the different product selectivity of the catalysts.The selectivity of both TiO 2 and PtO/TiO 2 for CH 4 was very poor.When PtO was loaded onto TiO 2 , the yield of CO and H 2 increased significantly, by 43 and 47, respectively, indicating that PtO loading could facilitate the generation of CO and H 2 .However, for Pt/TiO 2 , CH 4 was produced and the yield reached 3.99 mmol g A1 , while the production of CO was suppressed, indicating good selectivity for CH 4 .The cycling performance was analyzed to investigate the stability of PtO/TiO 2 and Pt/TiO 2 .As shown in Fig. S1 (ESI ), after 3 cycles over a total of 24 h, the total production has decreased by approximately 11 and 16, respectively, demonstrating a good stability and sustainability.The reduction of CO 2 to CH 4 requires more electrons and protons than the production of CO.Therefore, to explore the reasons for the reversed selectivity -that is, after the reduction of PtO to Pt, the dominant product of photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 over the catalyst changes from CO to CH 4 -the physicochemical properties of the catalysts were analyzed. The XRD patterns (Fig. 2) showed that Pt and PtO loading did not change the crystal structure of TiO 2 .The peaks marked A are the characteristic peaks of anatase, and the peaks marked R are the characteristic peaks of rutile, indicating that the TiO 2 in the three samples existed in a mixed phase of anatase and rutile; these findings were in good agreement with the literature. 38he ICP-OES results, listed in Table 2, confirmed that the Pt concentration of the prepared samples was consistent.The chemical states of the Pt species on the surface of catalysts were analyzed by XPS (Fig. 3a).A pair of peaks corresponding to Pt 2 were clearly observed in the spectra of PtO/TiO 2 at to the binding energies of 72.7 eV and 75.8 eV. 21,22No obvious signal attributable to Pt 0 was observed, indicating that Pt 2 was the dominant Pt species in PtO/TiO 2 .The Pt 4f XPS spectra of Pt/TiO 2 indicated binding energies of 71.0 eV and 74.7 eV corresponding to Pt 0 , accompanied by two weak peaks of Pt 2 , which may have been caused by the oxidation of Pt 0 nanoparticles. 23It is generally believed that the binding energy of Pt 0 as Pt 4f 7/2 is 71.2 eV. 39,40n contrast, the peak in Fig. 3a had a slightly negative deviation, corresponding to the configurations of 2p for Ti (Fig. 3b) and 1s for O (Fig. 3c), which indicated the formation of a heterojunction between TiO 2 and Pt and, consequently, the transfer of electrons from TiO 2 to Pt.The HR-TEM images of PtO/TiO 2 and Pt/TiO 2 are shown in Fig. 4a andf, and the size of the loaded particles is listed in Table 2.For PtO/TiO 2 , ultrafine PtO nanoparticles (average size 0.9 nm) were highly dispersed on the surface of TiO 2 ; in contrast, for Pt/TiO 2 , the Pt nanoparticles obtained by PtO reduction were clearly larger (average size 1.9 nm) and there were fewer particles.In addition, the size distribution of PtO particles was much narrower than that of Pt particles.These findings indicated that Pt nanoparticles migrated and grew up during the photoreduction process of PtO.As shown in the HADDF-STEM images (Fig. 4b andg), the PtO and Pt nanoparticles were distributed evenly on the TiO 2 surface.To further verify the components of PtO/TiO 2 and Pt/TiO 2 , EDX elemental mappings of Ti, O and Pt were investigated by STEM (Fig. 4c-e andh-j).The red and green areas are consistent with TiO 2 in HAADF-STEM images, whereas the yellow areas are consistent with the particles supported on TiO 2 surface.In addition, the XPS spectrum showed that the Pt element exists mainly in the form of Pt 2 in PtO/TiO 2 and Pt 0 in Pt/TiO 2 .Given this information, we can conclude that the particles on the surface of the two catalysts comprised mainly PtO and Pt. The UV-vis absorption spectra of samples are presented in Fig. 5a.The bandgap energy (E g ) was calculated from the formulas, E g 1240/l and (Ahn) n k(hn A E g ), where A is the absorption coefficient, k is a constant, n is 0.5 for semiconductors with an indirect band gap, hn is the energy of absorbed photon, and E g is the band gap energy. 41As shown in Fig. 5b, the bandgap energies of TiO 2 , PtO/TiO 2 , and Pt/TiO 2 were calculated as 3.41 eV, 3.25 eV, and 3.16 eV, respectively.The results showed that Pt and PtO both reduced the band gap of TiO 2 and enhanced the movement of photogenerated carriers; however, Pt resulted in a greater reduction.The reduced bandgap of PtO/TiO 2 and Pt/TiO 2 may be cause by the formation of Pt-O-Pt bonds between PtO and TiO 2 as well as Pt and TiO 2 .Additionally, Pt particles are more active and interact more strongly with TiO 2 , leading to a greater reduction in the TiO 2 bandgap. 42he PL emission spectra of PtO/TiO 2 , Pt/TiO 2 , and TiO 2 were recorded to investigate the efficiency of carrier transfer and separation (Fig. 6).For all samples, the emission peaks were present at approximately 550 nm, and were attributable to the band gap transition. 43The luminescence intensity of the three catalysts was different, from strong to weak, respectively: TiO 2 4 PtO/TiO 2 4 Pt/TiO 2 .This indicated that the loading of either Pt or PtO was beneficial to the separation of photoelectron-hole pairs.In addition, the loading of Pt nanoparticles had a greater ability to inhibit the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs than compared with loading of PtO, thus increasing the concentration of free electrons and providing more electrons for CO 2 reduction, which can be helpful for the production of CH 4 . The photocurrent response is reflection of the separation property of photogenerated electron and photogenerated hole.The higher the photocurrent, the higher the separation efficiency of photoelectron-hole pairs.As shown in Fig. 7, the photocurrent response exhibited the same trends as the PL emission spectra: the loading of Pt helped to enhance the photocurrent intensity, but the loading of PtO resulted in a weaker enhancement compared to Pt.These results indicated that the loading of Pt increased the concentration of free electrons and accelerated charge separation.Further, EIS Nyquist plots were generated to characterize charge transfer resistance (Fig. 8).The relative size of the radius of the arc on the Nyquist diagram corresponds to the size of the charge transfer resistance and the separation efficiency of the photogenerated electron hole pairs.The smaller the arc radius of the impedance spectrum, the better the separation effect of photogenerated electron-hole pairs.Compared with TiO 2 , Pt/TiO 2 , with the smallest radius, showed the lowest resistance; hence, PtO/TiO 2 , with the largest radius, showed the highest resistance, meaning that Pt loading assisted electron transfer but PtO loading suppressed electron transfer.Therefore, we concluded that Pt/TiO 2 could not only inhibit the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs but also facilitate charge transfer. The first step in CO 2 reduction is the adsorption of CO 2 on the catalyst surface.Therefore, the in-situ FT-IR spectra of CO 2 -carrying water vapor adsorbed on Pt/TiO 2 and PtO/TiO 2 surfaces in the dark for 60 min and under illumination for 60 min were collected (Fig. 10).The peak at 1662 cm A1 was assigned to H 2 O. 44 The peaks at 1595 cm A1 and 1392 cm A1 were attributed to HCO 3 A , which was formed by CO 2 and OH groups on the surface, and the peak at 1489 cm A1 was attributed to CO 3 2A , which was formed by the CO 2 and O groups. 45,46For Pt/ TiO 2 , after irradiation with UV light for 1 h, the IR peak for the CO 2 A species, an important intermediate in CO 2 reduction, was observed at 1714 cm A1 , 44,47 suggesting that CO 2 was successfully adsorbed and activated on the Pt/TiO 2 surface.Meanwhile, HCO 3 A and CO 3 2A clearly increased, indicating that Pt/TiO 2 could further activate and transform CO 2 .However, no obvious peaks at 1489 cm A1 and 1392 cm A1 were observed in the spectrum of PtO/TiO 2 , and the peak of CO 2 A was hard to observe, suggesting that the activation and conversion of CO 2 over PtO/ TiO 2 did not occur as easily as over Pt/TiO 2 . It is known that the selectivity of CO 2 reduction is greatly affected by the chemical state of the metal cocatalysts.The Pt 4f XPS spectra of Pt/TiO 2 (Fig. 9a) and PtO/TiO 2 (Fig. 9b) before and after CO 2 photoreduction experiments were recorded and compared.The results showed that the chemical state of the Pt species did not change after the reaction, which eliminated the possibility that the reversed product selectivity was caused by a change in the chemical state of Pt during the photoreduction of CO 2 . To further study the effect of platinum valence states on the hydrogenation of CO 2 to methane, H 2 -TPR experiments were conducted (Fig. 11).A strong peak appeared at 332 1C in the profile of the Pt/TiO 2 catalyst; this peak was attributable to the reduction of TiO 2 near Pt particles by H 2 , assisted by Pt, 48 indicating that Pt could effectively activate the catalyst surface, allowing the easy adsorption and dissociation of H 2 on the surface of Pt/TiO 2 .In comparison, there was a weak peak in the TPR profile of the PtO/TiO 2 catalyst at 314 1C, indicating that it was hard for H 2 to adsorb and dissociate on PtO/TiO 2 .Therefore, in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 , as H will readily form H 2 and then desorb from the PtO/TiO 2 surface when reduced, 49 the H 2 back-reaction is suppressed on PtO/TiO 2 , thereby not only promoting H 2 production but also inhibiting hydrogenation of CO 2 .In contrast, on the Pt/TiO 2 surface, the presence of Pt keeps Fig. 9 The IR spectra of CO 2 and water co-adsorbed on PtO/TiO 2 and Pt/TiO 2 . reduced H atoms on the Pt surface, which favors the participation of hydrogen in the hydrogenation of CO 2 to methane. For the solid-gas reaction, the main product of CO 2 reduction is CO, rather than CH 4 , owing to the high energy barrier and the increased number of carriers and protons needed during CH 4 formation.As the key intermediate during the process, the further reduction of CO is crucial to the product selectivity change of Pt and PtO as co-catalysts in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 . 50,51To further explore the mechanism, TPD and in situ DRIFTS were used to analyze CO. CO-TPD was performed to study the adsorption of CO on Pt/TiO 2 and PtO/TiO 2 .The results in Fig. 12 show that Pt/TiO 2 had significantly larger CO chemisorption capacity than PtO/ TiO 2 as determined from the area of CO desorption peaks.Notably, the CO desorption on Pt/TiO 2 peaked at approximately 152 1C, but that on PtO/TiO 2 began to flatten out at approximately 110 1C, demonstrating that CO adsorption on Pt/TiO 2 was stronger than that on PtO/TiO 2 .This suggested that Pt/TiO 2 favored the further reduction of CO to CH 4 .This may be because the highly dispersed PtO particles, which were smaller, occupied more adsorption sites on the TiO 2 surface, whereas Pt particles migrated and aggregated during the photochemical reduction of PtO into Pt, re-exposing the adsorption sites on the catalyst surface. 52O-FTIR analysis was also performed to provide further understanding of the adsorption sites of CO on Pt/TiO 2 and PtO/TiO 2 .The IR spectra of CO adsorbed on the surface of PtO/ TiO 2 and Pt/TiO 2 are shown in Fig. 13.The bands for linearly adsorbed CO were observed at 2091 cm A1 and 2070 cm A1 , corresponding to Pt terrace sites and low-coordination sites, respectively, and the band for bridge-type adsorbed CO was observed at 1853 cm A1 .53,54 The intensity ratio of IR peaks for linear-type to bridge-type was 1.7 : 1 for Pt/TiO 2 and 1.2 : 1 for PtO/TiO 2 , indicating that linearly coordinated CO could form more easily on the surface of Pt than PtO co-catalysts.In addition, it is well known that the low-coordination sites can more easily activate the reactants, acting as a trap for electrons and facilitating the photocatalytic reduction of CO. 20 Compared with Pt/TiO 2 , no significant enhancement was observed for the IR peak of CO adsorbed on the Pt terrace sites of PtO/TiO 2 despite the larger quantity and smaller size of PtO particles compared with Pt particles; this may have been due to the overstabilization of the Pt atoms by coordination with the oxygen in PtO/TiO 2 , 52 resulting in the deactivation of this site and the inhibition of further CO reduction. To explore how the relative activity of metallic Pt and oxidized Pt species affects CO reduction, the CO adsorption energies on the surface platinum atom of Pt 8 O 8 /TiO 2 (101) and Pt 12 /TiO 2 (101) were calculated.The Pt 12 cluster and Pt 8 O 8 cluster supported by the TiO 2 (101) surface were selected to simulate these two co-catalysts (Fig. S2,ESI ).The number of Pt atoms in the cluster was determined from the distribution and particle size obtained by TEM (Fig. 4), and the adsorption sites were determined by CO-FTIR (Fig. 13).All the successful adsorption structures of CO on Pt 8 O 8 /TiO 2 (101) and Pt 12 / TiO 2 (101) are shown in Fig. S3 and S4 (ESI ); the adsorption energy and Mulliken charges are listed in order in Table S1 (ESI ).The most stable sites are listed separately (Fig. 14 and Table 1), and further partial density of states (PDOS) analysis of CO adsorption was conducted for these sites.As shown in Table 1, the CO adsorption energy on Pt/TiO 2 was higher than that on PtO/TiO 2 at the top site and bridge site, respectively, suggesting that the adsorption of CO on metallic Pt was stronger than that of oxidized Pt species. The enhancement of CO adsorption ability by Pt and PtO was further examined by analysis of the PDOS of CO adsorbed on the Pt 8 O 8 /TiO 2 (101) and Pt 12 /TiO 2 (101) surfaces, as shown in Fig. 15, as well as the Mulliken charges listed in Table 3.As shown in Fig. 15, compared with free CO, in the PDOS of CO adsorption on these two models, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals of CO shifted down toward the Fermi energy level, demonstrating electron transfer from PtO and Pt clusters to CO.Even more remarkable was the more intense hybridization near the Fermi energy level in the PDOS of CO on Pt/TiO 2 , suggesting that the Pt cluster had a greater ability to transfer electrons to CO, corresponding to the more negative Mulliken charges of adsorbed CO, which were A0.19e A and A0.34e A at the top site and bridge site, respectively, whereas those of CO adsorbed on the PtO cluster were A0.08e A and A0.21e A , respectively (Table 3).The results provide a good explanation for the 1.36 eV and 1.38 eV higher CO adsorption energy on the Pt/TiO 2 surface at the top and bridge sites, respectively, than on the PtO/TiO 2 surface.Furthermore, from the PDOS (Fig. 15b) and Mulliken charges (Table 3), more electrons on the Pt/TiO 2 surface at the top site are donated to CO as compared with the bridge site, indicating that there were stronger electronic interactions between CO and the Pt/TiO 2 surface at the top site, providing good support of the results of CO-FTIR.hydrogenation of CO 2 .In contrast, for Pt/TiO 2 , it is difficult to desorb CO from Pt owing to the strong adsorption ability and electronic interactions, and H can remain adsorbed on the Pt surface after being reduced, further hydrogenating CO to CH 4 (Fig. 16)."}], "reactor type": [], "operation mode": []}}
