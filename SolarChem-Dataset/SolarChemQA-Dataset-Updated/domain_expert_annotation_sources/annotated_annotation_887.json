The precursor solution was then transferred to a glass plate and heated at 100C for 2 hrs to induce hydrolysis with water vapor and condensation during solvent evaporation.To crystallize the powders, the as-prepared white powders were calcined at 150, 300, or 500C for 3 hrs with a ramping rate of 5C/min, and the corresponding samples were denoted as T-150, T-300, and T-500. Crystalline structures were examined by using an X-ray Power diffractometer (XRD, Bruker D2 Phaser) with Cu K radiation (0.15418nm) as the X-ray source.The diffractograms were recorded in the 2 range from 10 to 90 at a sample width of 0.02 and a scanning speed of 4/min.BET surface areas were derived from N 2 -adsorption-desorption isotherms measured by TriStar 3000 gas adsorption analyzer at 77K.Band gaps of the photocatalysts were measured by using an UV-vis spectrometer (U-3010 Hitachi) equipped with an integrated sphere.Diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded from 900 to 200 nm at a scanning rate of 300 nm/min and the reflection of an aluminum-oxide plate was taken as a reference. Hydroxyl groups of the compounds were quantified by using a thermogravimetric analyzer (NETZSCH TG 209 F1 instrument).The weight loss of the samples was recorded from 35 to 900C at a rate of 10C/min under a N 2 flow.CO 2 adsorption capacities of the photocatalysts were determined by means of CO 2 temperature programed desorption (CO 2 -TPD) operated on a chemisorption analyzer (Micromeritics Autochem II 2920) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD).The powders (0.2 g) were placed in a U-shaped quartz tube and degassed under a He flow (50 mL/min) at 150C for 1 hr.After removal of physisorbed water, the powders underwent CO 2 adsorption at the room temperature for 1 hr followed by He purging to remove physisorbed CO 2 molecules.The chemisorbed CO 2 species was desorbed from the samples at elevated temperatures to 500C at a ramp of 10C/min and quantified by the TCD detector.Species that involved in the charge trapping and transfer of the photocatalysts were identified by using an electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometer (EPR, Bruker EMX-10/12) working at X-band frequency.The analysis was carried out under vacuum, CO 2 , and humidified CO 2 atmospheres and the spectra before and after irradiation were recorded.To prevent interference from the surface contaminants, all the samples were degassed at 120C under vacuum for 6 hrs before exposing to different atmospheres.A 400 W Hg lamp having a major output wavelength at 365 nm was used to excite the photocatalysts at a fixed distance from a sample cavity.The measurements were set at a center field of 3400 G and a sweep width of 2000 G.The microwave frequency was 9.64 GHz and the power was 2.0 mW.The surface species produced during the photocatalysis was examined by in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFT) recorded on a Nicolet iS10 FT-IR Spectrometer (Thermo scientific) equipped with a liquid nitrogen cooled HgCdTe (MCT) detector and a reaction chamber (Praying Mantis TM, Harrick).Prior to illumination, the samples in the reactor were purged with N 2 gas for 30 min to remove physisorbed water on the sample surface.Afterward, a CO 2 gas flow passing through a humidifier at 50 mL/min was conducted into the reactor for 30 min for CO 2 adsorption, and the remaining CO 2 /water vapor in the headspace of the reactor was then replaced by N 2 gas by purging the reactor with the inert gas for 5 min to reduce the spectral background.Photocatalysis was carried out in the sealed reactor by conducting 365 nm UV light from a light source (SP-9 spot cure, USHIO) to the The Journal of Physical Chemistry reactor through a quartz fiber.The absorption spectra were recorded for 32 scans at a resolution of 4 cm - 1 . Photocatalytic reduction was carried out in a tubular quartz reactor (80 mL) surrounded with 8 numbers of 8 W UV lamps radially.TiO 2 suspension was firstly prepared in the reactor by introducing 50 mg of powder into 20 mL distilled water with vigorous stirring.The suspension was then purged with N 2 gas for 30 min to remove dissolved O 2 molecules followed by CO 2 gas for another 30 min to dissolve CO 2 molecules into the water.Photocatalysis was triggered by illumination of the reactor with 305 nm UV light at a light intensity of 70.66 W/cm 2 .Products sampled from the headspace and from the suspensions and were analyzed by using a gas chromatography (GC, Thermo Trace GC Ultra) equipped with a Supel-Q plot fused silica capillary column (30 m0.53 mm id) at 50C with a He (99.99) flow at a rate of 3 mL/min.Separation of CO and O 2 species was achieved by using a RT-Msieve 5A (15 m0.25 mm id) column at 35C under a He (99.99) flow at 1 mL/min.Analysis of H 2 gas was completed with a molecular sieve 5A (60/80 mesh) at 30C under an Ar flow at 10 mL/min.The compounds were quantified by a flame ionization detector (FID), a thermal conductivity detector (TCD), or a mass detector."}, {"llm generation": "TiO2", "source": "Figure 1 shows microstructural and surface properties of the sol-gel-derived TiO 2 powders calcined at different temperatures.", "context": "Figure 1 shows microstructural and surface properties of the sol-gel-derived TiO 2 powders calcined at different temperatures.XRD patterns (Figure 1a) indicated that the TiO 2 powder was nearly amorphous at 150C and started to crystallize into an anatase phase with a crystallite size of 8.8 nm at 300C.The crystals kept growing with the increasing temperature and reached a larger size of 14.4 nm at 500C.Correspondingly, the band gaps, derived from the UV-vis absorption spectra (Figure 1b), slightly declined from 3.12 eV at 150C to 2.99 eV at 500C.TEM images not only show the increased crystallinity but also show the formation of meso-pores as the result of the elemental rearrangement.(see the Supplementary Material, Figure S1) The mesoporous feature was also reflected in the N 2 -adsorptiondesorption isotherms (Figure 1c), which appeared a hysteresis loop when the temperature was above 300C.Accordingly, the pore-size distribution shifted to a larger value and centered at 3.5 nm at 500C (Figure 1d).The BET surface area decreased dramatically from 274 to 23 m 2 /g when the temperature increased from 150 to 500C due to coalescence between particles.The calcination also drove dehydroxylation from the surface.Figure 2 shows O 1s XPS spectra, TGA curves and CO 2 -TPD profiles of the powders calcined at the three temperatures.The fraction of OH groups in the O 1s XPS spectra decreased with the increasing temperatures.The OH/Ti-O and OH/Ti elemental ratios, derived from the peak areas and the corresponding atomic sensitivity factors, respectively decreased from 0.37 to 0.13 and from 0.65 to 0.22 when the temperature increased from 150 to 500C.Larger amounts of OH groups and physisorbed water molecules resulted in significant weight loss in the TGA curve of the T-150 sample. Because the dehydroxylation mainly occurred at 120-500C by cross condensation between OH groups and every two OH groups resulted in one water molecule, the weight losses in the corresponding temperature range were used to calculate the density (D, numbers/nm 2 ) of OH groups by using the following equation. 1819 (1) where W is the weight loss per mg of sample, SSA is the specific surface area (m 2 /g), MW is the molecular weight of water (18.01 g/mol), is Avogadro's constant (6.023 10 23 mol -1 ), and is the calibration N coefficient (0.625). 20Amorphous T-150 powders contained the highest OH density of 12.45 /nm 2 , and the OH density decreased to 8.74 and 4.00 /nm 2 when the samples were calcined at 300 and 500C, respectively.To measure the capability of the photocatalysts for CO 2 chemisorption, CO 2 -TPD analysis was carried out for the three types of TiO 2 photocatalysts.Surface OH groups were able to interact with CO 2 molecules by attacking their acid center at C element with the basic O element and converted the CO 2 molecules into carbonate and bicarbonate species. 21The amorphous T-150 powder showed an intense peak centered at 228 o C and asymmetrically extended to 400 o C, which was the feature of decomposition of chelating and bridged carbonate species. 21222 The steep drop of the curve at 400 o C was attributed to crystallization which dramatically forced the adsorbed species to leave by elemental rearrangement.The similar carbonate feature was also found on the T-300 and T-500 powders but with lower intensities.In addition, deficiency of OH groups led the T-500 compound to show a peak of bicarbonate species at 110 o C. Compared to blank curves of the three samples, distinct peaks after CO 2 purging confirmed that these signals were from the CO 2 desorption.According to the peak intensities, the chemisorbed CO 2 amounts and density on the T-150, T-300, T-500 powders were 2.94, 1.18, 0.11 mmol/g and 6.47, 4.01, 2.88 /nm 2 , respectively.All the physicochemical data was summarized in Table 1. The Journal of Physical Chemistry were identified as the major and the second major products, respectively.In addition, few amounts of C 2 H 6 and C 2 H 4 were also measured.To ensure whether surface carbonaceous contaminates led to these products, blank tests without CO 2 purging were taken for the three-types of photocatalysts.None of the C-related species was found in all the control sets.Isotope experiments by using 13 CO 2 as a tracer were also conducted to ascertain carbon source of the CH 4 and CO products.Appearance of the CH 4 and CO with the m/z values at 17 and 29, respectively, confirmed that these products derived from CO 2 species. (see the Supporting Information, Figure S2) Figure 3 shows the product yields in the presence of the three types of TiO amounts were able to balance the reduced species in the systems. 23244 Long-term catalytic stability of the amorphous TiO 2 photocatalyst was examined by extending the reaction time to 24 hr (Figure 3e). Moreover, the recovery of the activity was examined by repeating the 10-hr-photocatalysis in the same system for three cycles (Figure 3f).While the CH 4 and CO product yields constantly increased, the production rate decreased with the time.The deactivation was attributed to the block of the active sites by hardly reduced intermediates and/or hindered CO 2 chemisorption caused by fast photo-induced atomic rearrangement. 2526627 In the cyclic test, although the activity declined from cycle to cycle, 75-90 of the activity in the previous cycle was able to be recovered in the next cycle.(see the Supporting Information, Table S1) This finding indicates that hindered CO 2 chemisorption was the main reason for the decreased activity during the photocatalysis and this temporary effect can be recovered when photocatalysis was suspended.To ascertain whether irradiation caused a permanent detrimental effect to the activity, the OH/Ti and OH/Ti-OH ratios of the amorphous TiO 2 particles sampled after each run of the cyclic photocatalysis were measured by using XPS.(see the Supporting Information, Figure S5 and Table S2) The OH/Ti and the OH/Ti-O ratio declined from 0.65 to 0.44 and from 0.37 to 0.23, respectively, after three photocatalytic cycles.This result indicates that photo-induced surface reconstruction indeed eliminated some OH groups to cause a certain extent of permanent reduction in the activity.In order to insightfully explore the reaction mechanisms, in-situ EPR and DRIFT analysis of the photoreduction on the three types of TiO 2 photocatalysts were further carried out.During the intermission, the system was purged with N 2 gas for 30 min followed by CO 2 gas for another 30 min.Ti 4 species, after irradiation. 28299 These species resulted from hole trapping by O O - -Ti 4 -OH - elements and the former peroxyl species produced when holes were trapped by two adjacent OH groups. Electron trapping by the Ti 3 ions at the interior lattice and at the surface sites, at the same time, appeared a sharp signal at g1.995 and a broad peak at g1.932, respectively. 28,3031 In the presence of water vapor, adsorbed H 2 O molecules scavenged the trapped holes, thus reducing the corresponding peaks in the EPR spectrum and greatly increasing the intensity of the trapped electrons due to charge separation.In the CO 2 atmosphere, both the trapped electrons and holes reduced.This result supports consumption of OH groups for CO 2 -to-carbonate conversion.Also, it reveals successful electron transfer from the TiO 2 surface to the chemisorbed carbonate species.When H 2 O vapor co-existed with CO 2 gas, all the features were similar to those in the CO 2 atmosphere except for slight decrease in the signals of the trapped holes.This finding indicates that the adsorbed carbonaceous species hindered water molecules to interact with surface trapped holes.Accordingly, the surface OH groups could be the main proton source for the reductions on the amorphous surface. After partial dehydroxylation at 300C, the semi-crystalline T-300 powder, during irradiation in the vacuum, showed and species at g 1 2.024, .015, g 3 2.004and at g 1 2.015, g 2 2.012, g 3 2.002,respectively. 32Due to loss of surface OH groups, the peroxyl species (Ti-O-O-Ti) became insignificant on the calcined sample.In the presence of H 2 O vapor, the intensities of both the surface and sub-surface trapped holes deceased.In addition, attack of the surface oxo bond with the H 2 O molecules formed species which appeared at g 1 2.032, g 2 Ti 4 -O 2 H 2.008, and g 3 2.002.In contrast to the amorphous system, hole scavenging by the adsorbed H 2 O molecules did not increase the intensity of trapped electrons in the semi-crystalline matrix.This finding indicates that the hole transfer through the surface O elements to the H 2 O scavenger was less efficient than through the peroxyl species.In the CO 2 atmosphere, electron transfer from the TiO 2 surface to the adsorbed CO 2 molecules increased the intensities of the trapped holes. 33At the same time, accumulated holes induced O 2 elimination, thus resulting in Ti 3 signals at g1.995 and g1.990 and the Ti 4 - 3 signals at g 3 2.014, g 2 2.009, and g 1 2.003. 30,34 ecause the Ti 3 signals increased slightly when H 2 O molecules were co-present with the CO 2 molecules, the H 2 O molecules on the semi-crystalline surface tended to assist CO 2 chemisorption, which drove more O 2 ejections and Ti 3 formation by electron scavenging.On the other hand, the crowded carbon species also interfered interaction of H 2 O molecules with the surface trapped holes, which was similar to the situation on the amorphous surface. The crystalline T-500 powder showed a distinct signal of single-electron-trapped oxygen vacancies at g 2.002 in the spectrum in the darkness. 35Since the oxygen vacancies remained similar intensities under different atmospheres in the darkness, most of them located inside the lattice.(see Supporting Information, Figure S3) Under illumination, the species appeared in the vacuum and Ti 4 -O 2 --Ti 4 - .- diminished in the presence of water vapor.In contrast to the trapped holes, the intensity of the oxygen vacancies just decreased under the CO 2 atmosphere.When CO 2 and H 2 O co-existed, both the oxygen vacancies and trapped holes were reduced.These results reveal that the CO 2 and H 2 O adsorptions took place separately on the hydroxyl-deficient surface and were less interfered with each other.The trapped electrons at the lattice oxygen vacancies can diffuse to the surface through the conduction band and participate in the surface reaction after photon excitation. Figure 5 shows DRIFT spectra of adsorbed and transformed species on the T-150 and T-500 powders. In the darkness, the T-150 powder exhibited weak and broad bidentate carbonate (b-CO 3 2-) feature at 1480-1580 cm -1 and hydrated carbon dioxide radical anions (CO 2 -(H 2 O) n ) in the range of 1630-1750 cm - 1 . 36377 When light was on, photo-induced Ti-O bond breaking and water dissociation immediately produced Ti 4 -OH species at 3765 cm -1 (Supporting Information, Figure S4).At the same time, interaction with the OH groups and acceptance of electrons from the surface turned physisorbed CO 2 molecules into bidentate carbonate (b-CO 3 2-, 1545 and 1355 cm -1 ), bicarbonate (HCO 3 -, 1436 and 1241 cm -1 ), and CO 2 - species (1687 cm -1 ). 3637738 The formation of the carbonate and bicarbonate species proceeded rapidly in the first 20 min and just became slow when a large fraction of the OH groups had been consumed.To focus on the changes in the surface features due to reduction, absorbance difference spectra were derived by subtracting all the spectra at different times with that at 20 min.In the difference spectra, a b-CO 3 2-species at 1570 cm -1 increased until 240 min and then decreased after that time.The blue shift of the b-CO 3 2- species from 1545 to 1570 cm -1 reflected electron transfer from the surface to the chemisorbed species during the irradiation.Unlike the bidentate species, such electron transfer to the bicarbonate (1434 cm -1 ) and monodentate-carbonate (m-CO 3 2-, 1454 cm -1 ) species were not obvious. 39It is noted that their intensity increased slowly with time and decreased slightly after 300 min, at which the bidentate carbonate species (1545 cm -1 ) increased correspondingly.These phenomena indicate that these monodentate intermediates tended to convert into the bidentate species and then underwent reduction.The H 2 COO-Ti (1647 and 1340 cm -1 ) and the CH 3 -O-Ti (1053 cm -1 ) were two intermediates growing with time after 20 min. 40411 According to their chemical structures and formation time, they likely derived from the bidentate carbonate species following the CO 3 2- H 2 COO-Ti CH 3 -O-Ti sequence.Electron transfer from the surface to the CO 2 -species also quickly increased the peak at 1697 cm -1 and decreased the peak at 1687 cm -1 .Meanwhile, the C-O-Ti bonding at 1127 and 1230 cm -1 decreased and increased, respectively.These correlations suggest that the CO 2 -species was bonded to a Ti 4 ion with the O element and then complexed to another adjacent Ti 4 ion with the C element after receiving another electron to form bidentate carbonite (CO 2 2-). 42After 120 min, the peak continuously shifted from 1697 to 1716 cm -1 , indicating the Ti-OC bond breaking and formation of Ti-COOH species. 43In contrast to the hydroxylabundant surface, irradiation produced HCO 3 -(1432 cm -1 ), m-CO 3 2-(1455 cm -1 ), CO 2 -(1683 cm -1 ), and monodentate formate (m-HCOO -, 1396 and 1730 cm -1 ) species as the major intermediates on the hydroxyl-deficient anatase surface. 38,43 hese features suggest oxygen vacancies and lattice O ions as the alternative sites for the photo-induced CO 2 chemisorption.With irradiation time, the HCO 3 -and m-CO 3 2- gradually transformed into b-CO 3 2-species.At the same time, the m-HCOO -species and CO 2 -turned into bidentate HCOO -(b-HCOO -, 1661 cm -1 ) and Ti-CHO (1763 cm -1 ) species, respectively. 4344 Amorphous photocatalysts generally perform lower photocatalytic activity than their crystalline structures due to severe defect-mediated charge recombination. 45In this study, the sol-gel-derived amorphous TiO 2 particles showed 5-times lower activity than the anatase T-500 particles for degradation of a model compound, bisphenol A. (see Supporting Information, Figure S6) However, the amorphous TiO 2 powder unexpectedly exhibited 14-times higher activity than the anatase TiO 2 crystals for CO 2 reduction.This new finding clearly reveals that surface properties determine the CO 2 reduction efficiency. In fact, many studies have demonstrated that surface decoration of photocatalysts with few amounts of noble metals improved the activity for artificial synthesis much greater than microstructural adjustment did.Such improvement is not only associated with the charge separation but also with the decreased overpotentials. 46In this study, high density of surface OH groups was the key to show the extraordinarily high activity on the amorphous TiO 2 particles.According to the TPD, EPR, and FTIR results, the contributions of OH groups to the CO 2 reduction included 1. improving CO 2 chemisorption; 2. trapping holes to suppress surface charge recombination; 3. forming the Ti-O-O-Ti species to facilitate hole transfer to water molecules; 4. on-site providing protons for CO 2 reduction.Positive effect of OH groups on CO 2 adsorption has been reported in other studies. 13,15 n this study, the abundant OH groups not only improved CO 2 adsorption but also converted CO 2 molecules into bonded carbonate as the major chemisorbed species.Compared to monodentate bicarbonate species which mainly produced at low OH densities, the bidentate carbonate species received electrons from the TiO 2 surface more effectively because it contained one more covalent bond to the surface Ti 4 ion.Crowded OH groups also triggered the Ti-O-O-Ti species to form via hole trapping at two adjacent OH sites when the OH density was higher than 8.74 /nm 2 .This peroxyl species was active to promote water oxidation. 26,47 ith effective consumption of the trapped holes by the promoted water oxidation, more electrons were able to escape from recombination, thus boosting electron transfer to the adsorbed carbon species.The protons dissociated from the OH groups can also participate in the hydrocarbon conversion processes.The on-site proton supply reduced concentration polarization, thus further facilitating the surface reaction to proceed.These interactions synergistically improved charge utilization at the interface, thus leading the amorphous TiO 2 particles to exhibit high activity for CO 2 reduction despite severe charge recombination taking place within their bulk lattice.In contrast to the reduction system, the influence of OH groups on photocatalytic oxidation was not crucial. 18The difference was associated with their different mechanisms.In oxidation systems, organic substances can be oxidized either directly by the surface trapped holes or by OH/OOH/H 2 O 2 oxidative species which produced by interaction of surface adsorbed H 2 O/O 2 species with trapped holes.These downhill reactions can proceed with low energy barriers.In contrast, CO 2 reduction is an uphill reaction.Chemisorption is the essential step for CO 2 molecules to reduce their reduction energy barriers.Therefore, surface OH groups, that assist CO 2 chemisorption, play an important role in determining the activity.Table 3 summarizes photocatalytic activity of TiO 2 particles prepared by different approaches for CO 2 reduction.Compared to the TiO 2 nanocrystals with sophisticated morphology or facet control (product yield: 0.8-26.5 mol/g; AQE: 0.13-0.73), the amorphous TiO 2 powder prepared by the simple sol-gel method exhibited competitive product yields (CH 4 : 11.23 mol/g, CO: 6.49 mol/g, AQE2.21) and outstanding apparent quantum efficiency. The Journal of Physical Chemistry The OH groups and the high specific surface area, however, diminished at elevated temperatures. Consequently, the photocatalysts reduced their adsorption ability for both CO 2 and H 2 O species and exhibited low photocatalytic activity.Regardless of the surface areas, the specific activity decreased to the lowest value at 300C and then recovered at 500C while crystallinity and quantity of oxygen vacancies increased.Oxygen vacancies within the bulk lattice can retard charge recombination by trapping charge carriers at the energy levels at 0.75-1.18eV below the conduction band. 9The defects locating at the surface have strong adsorption ability for CO 2 molecules (-24.66-26.19kcal/mol), which lower the activation energies for the CO 2 -to-CO conversion and the following hydrogenation or deoxygenation. 48499 In this study, the oxygen vacancies were the most active site on the anatase T-500 powder for CO 2 reduction.They not only quickly transformed the adsorbed CO 2 molecules into formate species when light was on, healing of the oxygen vacancies with the O elements from the CO 2 species but also weakened the C-O bonding to promote the following protonation.Hydrogen evolution was competing with the CO 2 reduction in the artificial synthesis.Due to lower energy barrier and simple reduction process, H 2 evolution is more kinetically favorable than the CO 2 reduction in some cases. 5051 In this study, both the amorphous T-150 and crystalline T-500 powders exhibited higher selectivity for CO 2 reduction except for the T-300-based system.These findings revealed that numerous or strong active sites for CO 2 chemisorption determined the selectivity toward CO 2 reduction.CH 4 and CO were the most and the second most produced products in this study.Although various hydrocarbon products have been identified in different CO 2 reduction systems, the key factor that determines the product selectivity is still uncertain so far. 52533 In this study, the mechanisms of CH 4 formation were proposed based on the in-situ DRIFT analysis and the details were illustrated in Scheme 1.On the hydroxylated surface, b-CO 3 2-, HCO 3 -, and CO 2 -were the three major photo-induced chemisorbed species, in which the b-CO 3 2-and CO 2 -species were the active ones to undergo the further reduction.The b-CO 3 2-species sequentially received 2 electrons and 2 protons to transform into CH 4 through the Ti-OOCH 2 Ti-O-CH 3 CH 4 sequence.Electron transfer from a surface Ti 4 ion to an approaching CO 2 molecule via its O element resulted in the CO 2 -species.Further receiving electrons turned the CO 2 -species into a bidentate CO 2 2-species which complexed to two adjacent Ti 4 ions with their O and C elements. 42,54 rotonation on the Ti-bonded O element weaken the Ti-O bonding of the CO 2 2-species and then produced Ti-COOH species.The carboxylic species could either undergo the Ti-COOH Ti-CHO Ti-CH 2 OH Ti-CH 3 CH 4 to produce CH 4 or decompose into CO by hydrogenation and dehydration. 54Compared to the former pathway, decomposition of the Ti-COOH into CO would be favorable because it took one less pronation step than the Ti-COOH Ti-CHO conversion. On the hydroxyl-deficient anatase surface, oxygen vacancies drove formation of formate species (HCOO -) as the active intermediate for CH 4 production.This species underwent three 2-electron and 1-proton additions to produce CH 4 though the m-HCOO - b-HCOO - Ti-OOCH 2 Ti-O-CH 3 CH 4 transformations.The oxygen vacancies also directly turned the CO 2 2-species into the Ti-CHO species without formation of the Ti-COOH intermediate.Also, it would drove decomposition of the CO 2 2-species into CO via the healing of the oxygen vacancy. 48e higher CH 4 selectivity in our case was presumably due to the abundant OH groups and oxygen vacancies on the TiO 2 surface.The CO 2 -species was the precursor of the CO product. 54On the hydroxylabundant surface, the OH groups converted CO 2 molecules into carbonate or bicarbonate species.On the anatase surface, strong Ti-O bonding at the oxygen vacancies inhibited the Ti-COOH formation from the CO 2 -species, thus suppressing CO formation.The CH 4 /CO molar ratios in the three TiO"}, {"llm generation": "TiO2", "source": "Figure 3. (a) Production yields and (b) specific production yields of reduced species in the photocatalytic systems with the three types of TiO 2 photocatalysts.", "context": "Sol-gel-derived amorphous TiO 2 particles have been demonstrated to exhibit 8-14 times higher activity than their thermally derived anatase crystals for CO 2 reduction because of their abundant OH groups and high surface area.The OH groups not only improved CO 2 chemisorption but also trapped holes to promote interfacial charge transfer synergistically.When the OH density was over 8.74 /nm 2 and as high as 12.45 /nm 2 , the interfacial charge transfer was able to compete with crystallinity to dominate the CO 2 reduction reactivity.CH 4 , CO, and H 2 were three major reduced products in the TiO 2 -based systems.Their selectivity varied with the different surface properties resulting from the elevated calcination temperatures. Presence of numerous OH groups or oxygen vacancies was essential to select CO 2 reduction rather than H 2 evolution and result in higher CH 4 /CO molar ratios.While bidentate carbonate was the major precursor to derive CH 4 on the hydroxylated surface, formate was the active species for the CH 4 production on the anatase crystals with oxygen vacancies.The CO 2 -species was responsible for the CO generation.
