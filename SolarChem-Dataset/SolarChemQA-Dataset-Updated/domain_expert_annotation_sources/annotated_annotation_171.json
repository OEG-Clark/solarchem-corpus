Fig. 1B shows the SEM image of the as-prepared TiO 2 nanorods after deposition with Ag nanoparticles.The top view showed that the nanorods were tetragonal and the lengths being approximately 2 m.The cross-sectional views (b-e) exhibited a uniform distribution of the metal on the surface of the nanorods and the size and diameter of nanoparticles diminishing with increasingly negative nucleation potential.The number of nanoparticles increased as more positions were invoked by increasing the nucleation potential.When the nucleation potential reached -0.8 V, agglomeration (van der Waals interactions) or aggregation (chemical bands) of Ag nanoparticles at the top part of the nanorods was observed as shown in Fig. 2b.In addition, the high nucleation potential had also destroyed the morphology of TiO 2 nanorods in Fig. 2b. High-resolution XPS spectra of Ag (3d) were displayed in Fig. 1C.The peaks observed at 363.3 and 369.4 eV referred to Ag 3d 3/2 and 3d 5/2 electronic states of metallic silver respectively.The 6.0 eV difference between the binding energy of the peaks was also the characteristic of metallic Ag 3d states 6,31.There was no peak for oxidized silver corresponding to Ag 2 O or AgO observed in the full XPS spectra of all the samples.Thus, XPS data together with SEM images, suggested that Ag nanoparticles were deposited on the nanorods.When the nucleation potential increased from -1.2 V to -0.8 V, XPS intensity was also increasing, indicating that different content of Ag nanoparticles were formed on the surfaces.There was no XPS spectra of the Ag component deposited under nucleation potential of -1.4 V, which was because that Ag nanoparticles were too small to be observed by XPS.In Fig. 2A XRD patterns showed TiO 2 nanorods were rutiles with growth axis in the (1 0 1) and (0 0 2) directions.The nanorods before and after electrodeposition showed the similar XRD curves.The absence of Ag component on TiO 2 nanorods showed that Ag did not enter the TiO 2 lattice 32.Ag-deposited TiO 2 nanorods at nucleation potential of -1.0 V were further investigated by TEM as shown in Fig. 2B andC.It clearly displayed that Ag nanoparticles amorphously covered TiO 2 nanorods with a diameter of 200 nm in Fig. 2B.Fig. 2C shows the high resolution TEM image of the Ag-TiO 2 nanocomposites.The spacing between two adjacent lattice fringes were 0.35 nm and 0.24 nm, corresponding to the (1 0 1) plane of TiO 2 and the (1 1 1) plane of Ag, respectively.The distinguished interface further confirmed the XRD results.The formation of chemical bond between TiO 2 and Ag nanoparticles was verified by the continuity of lattice fringes between them. Fig. 3A shows the UV-vis spectroscopy of the Ag-deposited TiO 2 nanorods at the different nucleation potentials.All the samples had higher absorbance intensities than the unmodified TiO 2 nanorod films in the range from 300 to 400 nm.It was observed a red shift and a broadening peak width with increase of nucleation potential between -1.4 V and -1.0 V.According to the SEM images, the nanorods-deposited Ag nanoparticles at the nucleation potential of -1.0 V exhibited a shorter distance between particles and a larger coverage area of particles without agglomeration, suggesting a better-proportioned metal dispersion than other samples.With the condition of unaggregation, the increase of the deposition amount of Ag on TiO 2 nanorods with the increasing nucleation potentials had increased the localized surface Plasmon resonance intensity of Ag nanoparticles 6,33,34,16.Thus, the increase of nucleation potentials leaded to the slight red-shift of absorption edge, which contributed to enhancing photoactivity under visible light 35.Fig. 3B shows the photoluminescence spectra of pure and Agdeposited TiO 2 nanorods.The fluorescence peaks of Ag-TiO 2 were the same as pure TiO 2 nanorods in the region of 400-450 nm.But the sample after Ag electrodeposition at the nucleation potential of -0.8 V had another peak in the region of 350-400 nm.This was because that aggregating Ag nanoparticles improved the recombination of excited electron-hole pairs 36.The lower intensity of Ag-TiO 2 nanorods revealed the decrease in recombining electron-hole pairs on metal-loaded TiO 2 nanorod surfaces.The positively charged plasmas of Ag nanoparticles attracted electrons in the conduction band of TiO 2 and then increased the capability of electron-hole separation 37.However, if the Ag nanoparticles were adjacent to each other, the separation pairs would have been recombining together very soon even under lower energy 38,39.As the nucleation potential of Ag deposition decreased, the corresponding intensity of the fluorescence decreased.This suggested that the size and the directional distribution of Ag nanoparticles significantly influenced the rate of e -/h separation in semiconductor, as well as re-dox reactions. The photocatalytic activity of Ag-TiO 2 with the deposited nucleation potentials of -1.2 V and -1.0 V was compared to that of pure TiO 2 nannorods.Fig. 4A exhibited the photocatalytic results in terms of the methane yield versus reaction time.Both Ag-deposited nanorods exhibited much higher methane total outputs (1.5-2.64 mol (g catal h) -1 ) than the pure TiO 2 (0.5 mol (g catal h) -1 ), suggesting the metal-decorated TiO 2 nanorods could highly enhance photocatalytic activity.The uniform distribution of Ag nanoparticles on the nanorods improved the separation of photogenerated electrons, as well as providing more electron traps than pure TiO 2 nanorods.In addition, the Ag nanoparticles as intermediates were more convenient to carry out photocatalytic reductions at superior rates.Both of them were responsible for the excellent photocatalytic performance of Ag-TiO 2 nanorods. The photocatalytic process of Ag-TiO 2 nanocomposites, as shown in Fig. 4B, was put forward to discuss the above phenomena in detail.In Fig. 4B (a) the electron transferred from the excited TiO 2 nanorods to Ag nanoparticles under UV light, due to the lower Fermi level of Ag (E f 0.4 V) than that of TiO 2 .Thus, more electrons assembled in the Fermi level of the metal and the whole Fermi level of Ag-TiO 2 was nearer to the conduction band of the TiO 2 , which brought better reductive power of nanocomposites 40.The improved electron-hole separation and the enhanced reductive power contributed to the photocatalytic activity of Ag-TiO 2 nanocomposites under UV irradiation.In addition, due to the localized surface plasma resonance of Ag nanoparticles, incident light induced an electric field in metal nanoparticles, and those negative charge plasmas and positive charge plasmas were separated, as shown in Fig. 4B (b).Then the negative charge plasmas near the valence band reacted with holes and positive charge plasmas near the conduction band reacted with electrons 27.The electrons transferring through the Ag nanoparticles reacted with absorbed oxidants to produce oxygen radicals (O 2 -), which reduced recombination probability in TiO 2 37.Together, Ag-deposited TiO 2 nanorods exhibit much better photocatalytic performance than the pure TiO 2 nanorods in our report.However, as the nucleation potential increased from -1.0 V to -0.8 V, the Ag nanopartilces aggregated together, which infringed the photocatalytic process.The possible explanation was that the aggregation improved the probability of holes captured by Ag nanoparticles and recombination of electron-hole pairs, thus the poorer photoreduction activity 40."}, {"llm generation": "Ag-TiO 2 nanocomposites", "source": "The results showed that Ag-TiO 2 nanocomposites exhibited higher photocatalytic activity of conversion CO 2 to CH 4 with rates up to 2.64 mol (g catal h) -1 than that of pure TiO 2 , possibly due to their specific structures and morphology assisting in the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes.", "context": "This work demonstrated Ag nanoparticles successfully deposited on TiO 2 nanorods by electrochemical method, could highly improve the photocatalytic activity.Under the different nucleation potentials the different size and distribution of Ag nanoparticles grew up on TiO 2 nanorods.Photoreduction activity measurements were evaluated by photoreduction of CO 2 under UV irradiation.The results showed that Ag-TiO 2 nanocomposites exhibited higher photocatalytic activity of conversion CO 2 to CH 4 with rates up to 2.64 mol (g catal h) -1 than that of pure TiO 2 , possibly due to their specific structures and morphology assisting in the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes.This report might provide new insights into the design and fabrication of advanced photocatalytic materials with complex hierarchical architectures and enhanced photocatalytic activity.

Fig. 1B shows the SEM image of the as-prepared TiO 2 nanorods after deposition with Ag nanoparticles.The top view showed that the nanorods were tetragonal and the lengths being approximately 2 m.The cross-sectional views (b-e) exhibited a uniform distribution of the metal on the surface of the nanorods and the size and diameter of nanoparticles diminishing with increasingly negative nucleation potential.The number of nanoparticles increased as more positions were invoked by increasing the nucleation potential.When the nucleation potential reached -0.8 V, agglomeration (van der Waals interactions) or aggregation (chemical bands) of Ag nanoparticles at the top part of the nanorods was observed as shown in Fig. 2b.In addition, the high nucleation potential had also destroyed the morphology of TiO 2 nanorods in Fig. 2b. High-resolution XPS spectra of Ag (3d) were displayed in Fig. 1C.The peaks observed at 363.3 and 369.4 eV referred to Ag 3d 3/2 and 3d 5/2 electronic states of metallic silver respectively.The 6.0 eV difference between the binding energy of the peaks was also the characteristic of metallic Ag 3d states 6,31.There was no peak for oxidized silver corresponding to Ag 2 O or AgO observed in the full XPS spectra of all the samples.Thus, XPS data together with SEM images, suggested that Ag nanoparticles were deposited on the nanorods.When the nucleation potential increased from -1.2 V to -0.8 V, XPS intensity was also increasing, indicating that different content of Ag nanoparticles were formed on the surfaces.There was no XPS spectra of the Ag component deposited under nucleation potential of -1.4 V, which was because that Ag nanoparticles were too small to be observed by XPS.In Fig. 2A XRD patterns showed TiO 2 nanorods were rutiles with growth axis in the (1 0 1) and (0 0 2) directions.The nanorods before and after electrodeposition showed the similar XRD curves.The absence of Ag component on TiO 2 nanorods showed that Ag did not enter the TiO 2 lattice 32.Ag-deposited TiO 2 nanorods at nucleation potential of -1.0 V were further investigated by TEM as shown in Fig. 2B andC.It clearly displayed that Ag nanoparticles amorphously covered TiO 2 nanorods with a diameter of 200 nm in Fig. 2B.Fig. 2C shows the high resolution TEM image of the Ag-TiO 2 nanocomposites.The spacing between two adjacent lattice fringes were 0.35 nm and 0.24 nm, corresponding to the (1 0 1) plane of TiO 2 and the (1 1 1) plane of Ag, respectively.The distinguished interface further confirmed the XRD results.The formation of chemical bond between TiO 2 and Ag nanoparticles was verified by the continuity of lattice fringes between them. Fig. 3A shows the UV-vis spectroscopy of the Ag-deposited TiO 2 nanorods at the different nucleation potentials.All the samples had higher absorbance intensities than the unmodified TiO 2 nanorod films in the range from 300 to 400 nm.It was observed a red shift and a broadening peak width with increase of nucleation potential between -1.4 V and -1.0 V.According to the SEM images, the nanorods-deposited Ag nanoparticles at the nucleation potential of -1.0 V exhibited a shorter distance between particles and a larger coverage area of particles without agglomeration, suggesting a better-proportioned metal dispersion than other samples.With the condition of unaggregation, the increase of the deposition amount of Ag on TiO 2 nanorods with the increasing nucleation potentials had increased the localized surface Plasmon resonance intensity of Ag nanoparticles 6,33,34,16.Thus, the increase of nucleation potentials leaded to the slight red-shift of absorption edge, which contributed to enhancing photoactivity under visible light 35.Fig. 3B shows the photoluminescence spectra of pure and Agdeposited TiO 2 nanorods.The fluorescence peaks of Ag-TiO 2 were the same as pure TiO 2 nanorods in the region of 400-450 nm.But the sample after Ag electrodeposition at the nucleation potential of -0.8 V had another peak in the region of 350-400 nm.This was because that aggregating Ag nanoparticles improved the recombination of excited electron-hole pairs 36.The lower intensity of Ag-TiO 2 nanorods revealed the decrease in recombining electron-hole pairs on metal-loaded TiO 2 nanorod surfaces.The positively charged plasmas of Ag nanoparticles attracted electrons in the conduction band of TiO 2 and then increased the capability of electron-hole separation 37.However, if the Ag nanoparticles were adjacent to each other, the separation pairs would have been recombining together very soon even under lower energy 38,39.As the nucleation potential of Ag deposition decreased, the corresponding intensity of the fluorescence decreased.This suggested that the size and the directional distribution of Ag nanoparticles significantly influenced the rate of e -/h separation in semiconductor, as well as re-dox reactions. The photocatalytic activity of Ag-TiO 2 with the deposited nucleation potentials of -1.2 V and -1.0 V was compared to that of pure TiO 2 nannorods.Fig. 4A exhibited the photocatalytic results in terms of the methane yield versus reaction time.Both Ag-deposited nanorods exhibited much higher methane total outputs (1.5-2.64 mol (g catal h) -1 ) than the pure TiO 2 (0.5 mol (g catal h) -1 ), suggesting the metal-decorated TiO 2 nanorods could highly enhance photocatalytic activity.The uniform distribution of Ag nanoparticles on the nanorods improved the separation of photogenerated electrons, as well as providing more electron traps than pure TiO 2 nanorods.In addition, the Ag nanoparticles as intermediates were more convenient to carry out photocatalytic reductions at superior rates.Both of them were responsible for the excellent photocatalytic performance of Ag-TiO 2 nanorods. The photocatalytic process of Ag-TiO 2 nanocomposites, as shown in Fig. 4B, was put forward to discuss the above phenomena in detail.In Fig. 4B (a) the electron transferred from the excited TiO 2 nanorods to Ag nanoparticles under UV light, due to the lower Fermi level of Ag (E f 0.4 V) than that of TiO 2 .Thus, more electrons assembled in the Fermi level of the metal and the whole Fermi level of Ag-TiO 2 was nearer to the conduction band of the TiO 2 , which brought better reductive power of nanocomposites 40.The improved electron-hole separation and the enhanced reductive power contributed to the photocatalytic activity of Ag-TiO 2 nanocomposites under UV irradiation.In addition, due to the localized surface plasma resonance of Ag nanoparticles, incident light induced an electric field in metal nanoparticles, and those negative charge plasmas and positive charge plasmas were separated, as shown in Fig. 4B (b).Then the negative charge plasmas near the valence band reacted with holes and positive charge plasmas near the conduction band reacted with electrons 27.The electrons transferring through the Ag nanoparticles reacted with absorbed oxidants to produce oxygen radicals (O 2 -), which reduced recombination probability in TiO 2 37.Together, Ag-deposited TiO 2 nanorods exhibit much better photocatalytic performance than the pure TiO 2 nanorods in our report.However, as the nucleation potential increased from -1.0 V to -0.8 V, the Ag nanopartilces aggregated together, which infringed the photocatalytic process.The possible explanation was that the aggregation improved the probability of holes captured by Ag nanoparticles and recombination of electron-hole pairs, thus the poorer photoreduction activity 40."}], "reactor type": [{"llm generation": "Fixed-bed", "source": "Photoreduction of CO 2 was conducted in a quartz reactor with the as-prepared TiO 2 film placed at the center of the container bottom.", "context": "TiO 2 nanorods were prepared by the hydrothermal method on FTO substrates following the report 26.In the beginning, FTO substrates (F: SnO 2 , Tec 15, 10 m, Hartford Glass Company) were ultrasonically cleaned for 60 min in a mixture of deionized water, acetone and 2-propanol with volume ratios of 1:1:1.Tecdeionized water and concentrated hydrochloric acid (36.5-38 by weight) were mixed (ratio 1:1) to reach a total volume of 480 mL, stirred at ambient conditions for 15 min, and then stirred for 15 min after the addition of 8 mL of titanium butoxide (97 Aldrich).The precursor solution immersed FTO substrates, placed at angle against the wall of the Teflon-liner with the conduction side facing down.TiO 2 nanorods were growing on FTO at 150 C for 20 h in an electric oven.After that, the FTO substrates were removed, rinsed completely with deionized water overnight and dried in ambient conditions.0.1 M KNO 3 , 0.2 mM sodium citrate (C 6 H 5 Na 3 O 7 ) and 0.05 mM AgNO 3 made up of aqueous electrolyte.The doublepotentiostatic method was used on an electrochemical workstation (ES550, Gaoss Union Technology Co., Ltd., Wuhan, China).Based on linear sweep voltammogram of TiO 2 nanorods film from 0.2 V to -1.5 V at -0.05 V/s, the nucleation potential was chosen to deposit Ag atoms ranging from -1.4 V to -0.8 V for 100 s and the growth potential was -0.2 V for 2400 s at room temperature (28 1 C) in a standard three-electrode system.FTO coated with TiO 2 nanorods was used as working electrode, Pt plate as counter electrode and saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as reference electrode.

The photocatalytic process of Ag-TiO 2 nanocomposites, as shown in Fig. 4B, was put forward to discuss the above phenomena in detail.In Fig. 4B (a) the electron transferred from the excited TiO 2 nanorods to Ag nanoparticles under UV light, due to the lower Fermi level of Ag (E f 0.4 V) than that of TiO 2 .Thus, more electrons assembled in the Fermi level of the metal and the whole Fermi level of Ag-TiO 2 was nearer to the conduction band of the TiO 2 , which brought better reductive power of nanocomposites 40.The improved electron-hole separation and the enhanced reductive power contributed to the photocatalytic activity of Ag-TiO 2 nanocomposites under UV irradiation.In addition, due to the localized surface plasma resonance of Ag nanoparticles, incident light induced an electric field in metal nanoparticles, and those negative charge plasmas and positive charge plasmas were separated, as shown in Fig. 4B (b).Then the negative charge plasmas near the valence band reacted with holes and positive charge plasmas near the conduction band reacted with electrons 27.The electrons transferring through the Ag nanoparticles reacted with absorbed oxidants to produce oxygen radicals (O 2 -), which reduced recombination probability in TiO 2 37.Together, Ag-deposited TiO 2 nanorods exhibit much better photocatalytic performance than the pure TiO 2 nanorods in our report.However, as the nucleation potential increased from -1.0 V to -0.8 V, the Ag nanopartilces aggregated together, which infringed the photocatalytic process.The possible explanation was that the aggregation improved the probability of holes captured by Ag nanoparticles and recombination of electron-hole pairs, thus the poorer photoreduction activity 40."}]}}
