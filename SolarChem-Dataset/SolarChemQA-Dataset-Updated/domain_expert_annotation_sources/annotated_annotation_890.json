Finally, the mixture was transferred to a 50 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and heated for 24 h at 200 C.Then the products were washed and dried in an oven at 80 C for 12 h before further characterization. 1 mmol Bi2O3 and 2 mmol SnO2 were dispersed in 20 mL ethanol by vigorous stirring to get a homogenous solution.After drying at 80 C, the mixture was calcined at 750 C for 10 h in muffle with a heating rate of 5 C/min.The as-synthesized product was denoted as bulk Bi2Sn2O7. The morphological, elemental compositional and atomic structural information was characterized by FE-SEM, EDX, AFM, TEM, HRTEM (JEOL-2100F) and aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy equipped with high-angular annular dark-field operated at 80 keV (STEM-HAADF, JEM-ARM200F).X-ray diffraction patterns were collected on an XRD Panalytical XPert Pro by monochromatic Cu K irradiation.The existence of oxygen defects was confirmed by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (JEOL JES-FA200 EPR) at 77 K.The chemical states and energy band structures of obtained samples were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (Kratos AXIS Supra XPS with a monochromatic Al-K source) and ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS).Bi L1-edge (eV) XAFS spectra were recorded at the beamline 14W1 of the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility, China.UV/vis spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer Lambda950 spectrophotometer.In-situ Fourier transfer infrared spectra (FTIR) were obtained via a Bruker vertex 70.The surface area and porosity of bulk Bi2Sn2O7 and Bi2Sn2O7 nanoparticles were measured by nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms at 77 K via an ASAP Tristar II 3020.CO2 adsorption measurements were perfromed on TriStar II 3flex with extra-high purity gasses.Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) measurements were performed through a quantachrome autosorb-iQ-C chemisorption analyser to test the CO desorption performance of obtained catalysts.In a typical CHI 660E electrochemical system, electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) was collected in a three-electrode cell with Pt and Ag/AgCl as the counter electrode and the reference electrode, respectively. The photocatalytic CO2 performance of bulk Bi2Sn2O7 and Bi2Sn2O7 NPs were examined by a 500 mL Labsolar-6A closed gas system (Perfectlight, China).Specifically, 20 mg samples were well dispersed into 50 mL water.Before the measurement, the system was degassed and repumped into high purity CO2 with a pressure of 0.08 MPa.A 300 W Xe lamp (Microsolar300, Perfectlight) was amounted as light source simulating solar light irradiation.The test was carried out at about 5 o C and products were detected by gas chromatograph (Cotrun GC2002, FID).The apparent quantum efficiency of CO is calculated via the following equation: apparent quantum efficiency (amount of generated CO 2)/amount of incident photons 100.The carbon source of CO was identified by 13 C isotopic labeling experiment using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (7890A and 5975C, Agilent). The simulation of this work related to density functional theory (DFT) mentioned in the manuscript was conducted using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) 212223 .Projector augmented wave (PAW) potentials were used to treat ion-electron interactions, and the exchangecorrelation contributions were treated by generalized gradient approximation (GGA), specifically, the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional 24 . In the process of optimizing the lattice structure of Bi2Sn2O7 crystal, conjugate gradient algorithm with a force tolerance of 0.01 eV/A and a kinetic energy cutoff 500 eV was used to control the optimization convergence.The Gamma k-point sampling was set to be 5 5 5. To further simulate adsorption of CO2 molecule and other molecular/racial intermediate products onto Bi2Sn2O7, a 22 supercell was built by cutting the original cell along (001) facet, with a 25 A additional vacuum layer added along the z-direction.A seven-layer slab was used to mimic Bi2Sn2O7 (001) surface, with the top three layers free to move, and the bottom four layer fixed.For these surface/radical interactions simulated in supercells, the plane wave cutoff energy set as 500 eV and the k-point mesh set as 331. The DFT-D3 method with Becke-Jonson damping was adopted to include van der Waals interactions for surface/radical interactions. The free energy of all the species in this work was calculated by the formula: where E is the total energy, ZPE is the zero-point energy, S is the entropy and T is the room temperature (298K). For vibrational frequencies calculations, atoms belonging to molecules/free radicals (CO2, CO2, COOH...) were set free to move, while atoms of base materials (Bi2Sn2O7) were fixed.After frequencies obtained, the ZPE and entropy can be derived by the flowing two equations: where h is the Planck constant, k is the Boltzmann constant, R is gas constant, and T is 298K."}, {"llm generation": "Bi2Sn2O7 NPs", "source": "17Guided by the above theoretical design, the as-prepared VO-rich ultra-small Bi2Sn2O7 NPs may be a desirable structure to boost the CO2 photoreduction performance.", "context": "Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to insight the possibility of CO2 activation on oxygen defects of Bi2Sn2O7 (Figure S1).On the perfect Bi2Sn2O7 surface, CO2 was mainly absorbed in a parallel manner with a length of 1.18 A (Figure S1a).While, after the introduction of oxygen vacancies, CO2 could be adsorbed on the defect site via O1 atom coordinating with surrounding metal atoms with an upright geometry (Figure S1b).The representative CO length of adsorbed CO2 molecule apparently changes to 1.29 A (bottom) with a bending angle of 129. Charge density difference was further carried out to trace the origin of the adsorption behavior of CO2.The electrons neighboring oxygen vacancies could be localized, supplying a high-density electronic state for molecular activation (Figure 1a,S2).After engineering CO2 molecular, oxygen vacancies can serve as the major exchange and transfer centers of electrons, in which the yellow and blue isosurfaces means charge accumulation and depletion in the space (Figure 1b).The back donation of electrons from oxygen vacancies into the C-O antibonding states to activate the adsorbed CO2, leading to the elongation and bending effect of CO bond.As a result, CO2 can powerfully interact with the surface of Bi2Sn2O7 at oxygen defects due to localized charge carriers, facilitating the transfer of photoexcited electrons to absorbed molecules. 17Guided by the above theoretical design, the as-prepared VO-rich ultra-small Bi2Sn2O7 NPs may be a desirable structure to boost the CO2 photoreduction performance. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns reveal the crystallographic structure of Bi2Sn2O7 NPs (Figure S3), which could be readily indexed to JCPDS No. 17 NPs exhibit a nanoparticle-like morphology with the average lateral diameter around 4 nm (Figure 1c,d).The interplanar spacing of 0.349 nm can be attributed to d spacing of (019) planes of Bi2Sn2O7, as observed in high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (Figure 2d).The Bi2Sn2O7 NPs with average thickness of 4 nm have been well characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Figure S4), which further proves the ultra-small feature of as-prepared Bi2Sn2O7 NPs.Aberration-corrected highangle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) was further performed to study the crystal structure information.Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were employed to directly characterize oxygen vacancies on the surface.Both Bi2Sn2O7 NPs and bulk counterparts (Figure S5-S7) exhibit a symmetrical EPR signal at g 2.001, which provides convictive evidence of the electron trapping on oxygen vacancies 25 (Figure 2a).It is noteworthy that the signal of the former shows a significantly enhanced intensity compared with that of the latter, manifesting that Bi2Sn2O7 NPs possess a much higher concentration of oxygen vacancies.Figure 2b displays the XPS spectra of O 1s core levels for as-prepared NPs and bulk Bi2Sn2O7.Both spectra can be deconvoluted into 2 peaks, respectively.The banding energy at 530.4 eV can be ascribed to metal-oxygen bond, while the peak located at 532.4 eV corresponds to O-atoms in the vicinity of an O defect.Notably, the higher oxygen vacancy concentration can be observed in Bi2Sn2O7 NPs relative to bulk counterpart, further certified by the more positive zeta potentials of VO-rich Bi2Sn2O7 than bulk Bi2Sn2O7 26 (Figure S8).X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and extend-X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) were carried out to explore the detailed coordinative environment of Bi.As shown in Figure 2c, the maximum Bi L1-edge spectral peak of Bi2Sn2O7 NPs is similar to bulk counterpart, indicating that the Bi species in Bi2Sn2O7 NPs and bulk counterpart possess similar local atomic structure and oxidation states 27 .Furthermore, R-space spectra from EXAFS provide evidence of refined local atomic arrangement of Bi atoms (Figure 2d).The notable peak located 1.6 A could be well attributed to the Bi-O contribution 10 .This Bi2Sn2O7 NPs shows obvious lower peak intensity relative to bulk Bi2Sn2O7, suggesting the decrease in the Bi-O coordination number.Based on the above result, it safely arrives that ultra-small Bi2Sn2O7 NPs with abundant oxygen vacancies have been successfully fabricated.The number of oxygen vacancies was considerably increased accompanying by the emerging of coordinatively unsaturated metal ions adjacent to O vacancies, which can efficiently trap photoinduced electrons and reduce the electron-hole recombination rate.relative perfect Bi2Sn2O7.Due to the easier electron transition and higher carrier concentration, the increased charge separation efficiency and enhanced electronic conductivity can be achieved in Bi2Sn2O7 NPs.The bandgaps for two samples were determined by the Tauc plot (Figure S9), to be 2.92 eV for Bi2Sn2O7 NPs and 2.88 eV for the bulk counterpart.Furthermore, the detailed energy band structures were examined by ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS) measurements (Figure 2f).The valence band (VB) of Bi2Sn2O7 NPs and the bulk Bi2Sn2O7 can be determined to be 2.45 (21.22-18.163.83-4.44 2.45) and 2.69 eV, respectively, versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE).Therefore, the corresponding conduction band (CB) positions are estimated to be -0.47 and -0.19 eV, respectively.Thermodynamically, the electrons in a semiconductor with more negative value possess enhanced reduction ability.Therefore, CO2 can be better reduced to generate carbonbased fuels over Bi2Sn2O7 NPs (Figure 2i). 28 disclose the effect of the defective ultra-small structure in photocatalysis, the solar CO2 reduction experiments were carried out in the absence of cocatalyst and sacrifice reagent irradiated by 300 W Xe lamp.Both two samples exhibited high selectivity (over 99) with CO as the dominant product, accompanied by a negligible amount of methane.As shown in Figure 3a, greatly improved CO formation rate can be observed over Bi2Sn2O7 NPs with an average rate of 14.88 mol g -1 h -1 , roughly 8.1 times the amount of that of the bulk counterpart (1.83 mol g -1 h -1 ).This value is comparable to or superior to state-of-the-art reported results (Table S1).The apparent quantum efficiency of Bi2Sn2O7 NPs at 380 and 400 nm are calculated to be 0.21 and 0.055 within 6 h, respectively (Figure S11).No CO was detected during control experiments, which were conducted under the condition of darkness, in the absence of catalysts, or in Ar, suggesting CO originated from photocatalytic CO2 reduction over Bi2Sn2O7 NPs under Xe lamp irradiation.To further firmly identify the carbon source of CO, 13 C isotopic labeling experiment was performed using 13 CO2 as the reactant. The signal of 13 CO can be obviously identified, which is corresponded to the peak at m/z29 in To reveal the mechanism and reaction intermediates in CO2 conversion process, in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was performed (Figure 3d).Due to the coadsorption of CO2 and H2O, the signals of monodentate carbonate groups (m-CO3 2-) can be well identified at 1526 cm -1 , while the peak at 1327 cm -1 can be assigned to symmetric O-C-O stretches of bidentate carbonate (b-CO3 2-). 28,29 he signature peak of carbonxylate (CO2 -) can be observed at 1249 cm -1 . 7tably, the peaks at 1570 cm The specific intermediate converts to CO by a further protonation process.5) Finally, CO will be desorbed from the surface of Bi2Sn2O7 NPs.DFT calculation was carried out to reveal the photocatalytic nature of CO2-to-CO conversion (Figure 4).Both activation of adsorbed CO2 and formation of COOH required external energy for perfect Bi2Sn2O7.After the introduction of oxygen vacancies, both the aforementioned 2 steps turn to a highly exergonic process, suggesting the introduction of oxygen vacancy can significantly promote the activation of CO2 and stabilize COOH intermediates.The desorption of CO is the potential limiting step for both the photoreduction process over perfect Bi2Sn2O7 and oxygen vacancy mediated Bi2Sn2O7.However, the engineered oxygen vacancy can effectively lower the desorption energy CO, from 3.22 to 2.39 eV, beneficial to the CO desorption."}, {"llm generation": "Bi2Sn2O7 NPs", "source": "These two factors together contributed to the 8.1 times boosted photocatalytic performance of Bi2Sn2O7 NPs towards CO2-to-CO conversion, in which the CO formation rate can arrive 14.88 mol g -1 h -1 .", "context": "In summary, Bi2Sn2O7 NPs with enriched oxygen vacancies have been successfully prepared via a surfactant polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) assisted hydrothermal method.Oxygen vacancies significantly promote the activation of CO2 and stabilization of COOH intermediates, meanwhile, lower the energy barrier of potential determining step, the desorption of CO.Besides, the ultra-small structure significantly accelerated the speed of bulk charge diffusion.These two factors together contributed to the 8.1 times boosted photocatalytic performance of Bi2Sn2O7 NPs towards CO2-to-CO conversion, in which the CO formation rate can arrive 14.88 mol g -1 h -1 .This study holds significant promise for the design and synthesis of ultra-small semiconductor catalysts with -0457.The broad diffraction peaks of NPs indicate the nanosized features of NPs.Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of Bi2Sn2O7 Figure1e, f, g reveal continuous and ordered lattice fringes with d spacing of 0.257 nm and 0.338 nm, which are consistent with the (029) and(1 1 5) plane of Bi2Sn2O7, respectively.The intact ordered Bi and Sn atoms suggest no metal vacancies formed on the surface.Oxygen vacancies are hardly be directly observed from HAADF-STEM due to Z contrast difference between fairly light O and heavier Bi and Sn atoms.Elemental mapping analysis of the STEM results demonstrate the homogeneous dispersion of Sn, O and Bi elements (Figure1h).Conclusively, XRD, TEM, AFM, coupled with HAADF-STEM together provide solid evidence of the ultra-small nanoparticle morphology of Bi2Sn2O7.

The signal of 13 CO can be obviously identified, which is corresponded to the peak at m/z29 in To reveal the mechanism and reaction intermediates in CO2 conversion process, in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was performed (Figure 3d).Due to the coadsorption of CO2 and H2O, the signals of monodentate carbonate groups (m-CO3 2-) can be well identified at 1526 cm -1 , while the peak at 1327 cm -1 can be assigned to symmetric O-C-O stretches of bidentate carbonate (b-CO3 2-). 28,29 he signature peak of carbonxylate (CO2 -) can be observed at 1249 cm -1 . 7tably, the peaks at 1570 cm The specific intermediate converts to CO by a further protonation process.5) Finally, CO will be desorbed from the surface of Bi2Sn2O7 NPs.DFT calculation was carried out to reveal the photocatalytic nature of CO2-to-CO conversion (Figure 4).Both activation of adsorbed CO2 and formation of COOH required external energy for perfect Bi2Sn2O7.After the introduction of oxygen vacancies, both the aforementioned 2 steps turn to a highly exergonic process, suggesting the introduction of oxygen vacancy can significantly promote the activation of CO2 and stabilize COOH intermediates.The desorption of CO is the potential limiting step for both the photoreduction process over perfect Bi2Sn2O7 and oxygen vacancy mediated Bi2Sn2O7.However, the engineered oxygen vacancy can effectively lower the desorption energy CO, from 3.22 to 2.39 eV, beneficial to the CO desorption."}], "lamp": [{"llm generation": "Xenon", "source": "A 300 W Xe lamp (Microsolar300, Perfectlight) was amounted as light source simulating solar light irradiation.", "context": "0.5 mmol Bi(NO3)35H2O and 0.2 g PVP were mixed together to dissolve into 15 mL mannitol solution (0.1 M) under stirring for 10 minutes.Meanwhile, Na2SnO3 solution was prepared by dissolving 0.5 mmol Na2SnO33H2O into 3 mL H2O.Subsequently, mix the above as-prepared solution by injecting Na2SnO3 solution into PVP contained one under vigorous stirring.After further stirring for 10 minutes, 2 M NaOH solution adjust the pH value of the solution to 10. Finally, the mixture was transferred to a 50 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and heated for 24 h at 200 C.Then the products were washed and dried in an oven at 80 C for 12 h before further characterization. 1 mmol Bi2O3 and 2 mmol SnO2 were dispersed in 20 mL ethanol by vigorous stirring to get a homogenous solution.After drying at 80 C, the mixture was calcined at 750 C for 10 h in muffle with a heating rate of 5 C/min.The as-synthesized product was denoted as bulk Bi2Sn2O7. The morphological, elemental compositional and atomic structural information was characterized by FE-SEM, EDX, AFM, TEM, HRTEM (JEOL-2100F) and aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy equipped with high-angular annular dark-field operated at 80 keV (STEM-HAADF, JEM-ARM200F).X-ray diffraction patterns were collected on an XRD Panalytical XPert Pro by monochromatic Cu K irradiation.The existence of oxygen defects was confirmed by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (JEOL JES-FA200 EPR) at 77 K.The chemical states and energy band structures of obtained samples were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (Kratos AXIS Supra XPS with a monochromatic Al-K source) and ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS).Bi L1-edge (eV) XAFS spectra were recorded at the beamline 14W1 of the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility, China.UV/vis spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer Lambda950 spectrophotometer.In-situ Fourier transfer infrared spectra (FTIR) were obtained via a Bruker vertex 70.The surface area and porosity of bulk Bi2Sn2O7 and Bi2Sn2O7 nanoparticles were measured by nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms at 77 K via an ASAP Tristar II 3020.CO2 adsorption measurements were perfromed on TriStar II 3flex with extra-high purity gasses.Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) measurements were performed through a quantachrome autosorb-iQ-C chemisorption analyser to test the CO desorption performance of obtained catalysts.In a typical CHI 660E electrochemical system, electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) was collected in a three-electrode cell with Pt and Ag/AgCl as the counter electrode and the reference electrode, respectively. The photocatalytic CO2 performance of bulk Bi2Sn2O7 and Bi2Sn2O7 NPs were examined by a 500 mL Labsolar-6A closed gas system (Perfectlight, China).Specifically, 20 mg samples were well dispersed into 50 mL water.Before the measurement, the system was degassed and repumped into high purity CO2 with a pressure of 0.08 MPa.A 300 W Xe lamp (Microsolar300, Perfectlight) was amounted as light source simulating solar light irradiation.The test was carried out at about 5 o C and products were detected by gas chromatograph (Cotrun GC2002, FID).The apparent quantum efficiency of CO is calculated via the following equation: apparent quantum efficiency (amount of generated CO 2)/amount of incident photons 100.The carbon source of CO was identified by 13 C isotopic labeling experiment using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (7890A and 5975C, Agilent). The simulation of this work related to density functional theory (DFT) mentioned in the manuscript was conducted using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) 212223 .Projector augmented wave (PAW) potentials were used to treat ion-electron interactions, and the exchangecorrelation contributions were treated by generalized gradient approximation (GGA), specifically, the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional 24 . In the process of optimizing the lattice structure of Bi2Sn2O7 crystal, conjugate gradient algorithm with a force tolerance of 0.01 eV/A and a kinetic energy cutoff 500 eV was used to control the optimization convergence.The Gamma k-point sampling was set to be 5 5 5. To further simulate adsorption of CO2 molecule and other molecular/racial intermediate products onto Bi2Sn2O7, a 22 supercell was built by cutting the original cell along (001) facet, with a 25 A additional vacuum layer added along the z-direction.A seven-layer slab was used to mimic Bi2Sn2O7 (001) surface, with the top three layers free to move, and the bottom four layer fixed.For these surface/radical interactions simulated in supercells, the plane wave cutoff energy set as 500 eV and the k-point mesh set as 331. The DFT-D3 method with Becke-Jonson damping was adopted to include van der Waals interactions for surface/radical interactions. The free energy of all the species in this work was calculated by the formula: where E is the total energy, ZPE is the zero-point energy, S is the entropy and T is the room temperature (298K). For vibrational frequencies calculations, atoms belonging to molecules/free radicals (CO2, CO2, COOH...) were set free to move, while atoms of base materials (Bi2Sn2O7) were fixed.After frequencies obtained, the ZPE and entropy can be derived by the flowing two equations: where h is the Planck constant, k is the Boltzmann constant, R is gas constant, and T is 298K."}, {"llm generation": "Xenon", "source": "28 disclose the effect of the defective ultra-small structure in photocatalysis, the solar CO2 reduction experiments were carried out in the absence of cocatalyst and sacrifice reagent irradiated by 300 W Xe lamp.", "context": "Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to insight the possibility of CO2 activation on oxygen defects of Bi2Sn2O7 (Figure S1).On the perfect Bi2Sn2O7 surface, CO2 was mainly absorbed in a parallel manner with a length of 1.18 A (Figure S1a).While, after the introduction of oxygen vacancies, CO2 could be adsorbed on the defect site via O1 atom coordinating with surrounding metal atoms with an upright geometry (Figure S1b).The representative CO length of adsorbed CO2 molecule apparently changes to 1.29 A (bottom) with a bending angle of 129. Charge density difference was further carried out to trace the origin of the adsorption behavior of CO2.The electrons neighboring oxygen vacancies could be localized, supplying a high-density electronic state for molecular activation (Figure 1a,S2).After engineering CO2 molecular, oxygen vacancies can serve as the major exchange and transfer centers of electrons, in which the yellow and blue isosurfaces means charge accumulation and depletion in the space (Figure 1b).The back donation of electrons from oxygen vacancies into the C-O antibonding states to activate the adsorbed CO2, leading to the elongation and bending effect of CO bond.As a result, CO2 can powerfully interact with the surface of Bi2Sn2O7 at oxygen defects due to localized charge carriers, facilitating the transfer of photoexcited electrons to absorbed molecules. 17Guided by the above theoretical design, the as-prepared VO-rich ultra-small Bi2Sn2O7 NPs may be a desirable structure to boost the CO2 photoreduction performance. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns reveal the crystallographic structure of Bi2Sn2O7 NPs (Figure S3), which could be readily indexed to JCPDS No. 17 NPs exhibit a nanoparticle-like morphology with the average lateral diameter around 4 nm (Figure 1c,d).The interplanar spacing of 0.349 nm can be attributed to d spacing of (019) planes of Bi2Sn2O7, as observed in high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (Figure 2d).The Bi2Sn2O7 NPs with average thickness of 4 nm have been well characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Figure S4), which further proves the ultra-small feature of as-prepared Bi2Sn2O7 NPs.Aberration-corrected highangle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) was further performed to study the crystal structure information.Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were employed to directly characterize oxygen vacancies on the surface.Both Bi2Sn2O7 NPs and bulk counterparts (Figure S5-S7) exhibit a symmetrical EPR signal at g 2.001, which provides convictive evidence of the electron trapping on oxygen vacancies 25 (Figure 2a).It is noteworthy that the signal of the former shows a significantly enhanced intensity compared with that of the latter, manifesting that Bi2Sn2O7 NPs possess a much higher concentration of oxygen vacancies.Figure 2b displays the XPS spectra of O 1s core levels for as-prepared NPs and bulk Bi2Sn2O7.Both spectra can be deconvoluted into 2 peaks, respectively.The banding energy at 530.4 eV can be ascribed to metal-oxygen bond, while the peak located at 532.4 eV corresponds to O-atoms in the vicinity of an O defect.Notably, the higher oxygen vacancy concentration can be observed in Bi2Sn2O7 NPs relative to bulk counterpart, further certified by the more positive zeta potentials of VO-rich Bi2Sn2O7 than bulk Bi2Sn2O7 26 (Figure S8).X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and extend-X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) were carried out to explore the detailed coordinative environment of Bi.As shown in Figure 2c, the maximum Bi L1-edge spectral peak of Bi2Sn2O7 NPs is similar to bulk counterpart, indicating that the Bi species in Bi2Sn2O7 NPs and bulk counterpart possess similar local atomic structure and oxidation states 27 .Furthermore, R-space spectra from EXAFS provide evidence of refined local atomic arrangement of Bi atoms (Figure 2d).The notable peak located 1.6 A could be well attributed to the Bi-O contribution 10 .This Bi2Sn2O7 NPs shows obvious lower peak intensity relative to bulk Bi2Sn2O7, suggesting the decrease in the Bi-O coordination number.Based on the above result, it safely arrives that ultra-small Bi2Sn2O7 NPs with abundant oxygen vacancies have been successfully fabricated.The number of oxygen vacancies was considerably increased accompanying by the emerging of coordinatively unsaturated metal ions adjacent to O vacancies, which can efficiently trap photoinduced electrons and reduce the electron-hole recombination rate.relative perfect Bi2Sn2O7.Due to the easier electron transition and higher carrier concentration, the increased charge separation efficiency and enhanced electronic conductivity can be achieved in Bi2Sn2O7 NPs.The bandgaps for two samples were determined by the Tauc plot (Figure S9), to be 2.92 eV for Bi2Sn2O7 NPs and 2.88 eV for the bulk counterpart.Furthermore, the detailed energy band structures were examined by ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS) measurements (Figure 2f).The valence band (VB) of Bi2Sn2O7 NPs and the bulk Bi2Sn2O7 can be determined to be 2.45 (21.22-18.163.83-4.44 2.45) and 2.69 eV, respectively, versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE).Therefore, the corresponding conduction band (CB) positions are estimated to be -0.47 and -0.19 eV, respectively.Thermodynamically, the electrons in a semiconductor with more negative value possess enhanced reduction ability.Therefore, CO2 can be better reduced to generate carbonbased fuels over Bi2Sn2O7 NPs (Figure 2i). 28 disclose the effect of the defective ultra-small structure in photocatalysis, the solar CO2 reduction experiments were carried out in the absence of cocatalyst and sacrifice reagent irradiated by 300 W Xe lamp.Both two samples exhibited high selectivity (over 99) with CO as the dominant product, accompanied by a negligible amount of methane.As shown in Figure 3a, greatly improved CO formation rate can be observed over Bi2Sn2O7 NPs with an average rate of 14.88 mol g -1 h -1 , roughly 8.1 times the amount of that of the bulk counterpart (1.83 mol g -1 h -1 ).This value is comparable to or superior to state-of-the-art reported results (Table S1).The apparent quantum efficiency of Bi2Sn2O7 NPs at 380 and 400 nm are calculated to be 0.21 and 0.055 within 6 h, respectively (Figure S11).No CO was detected during control experiments, which were conducted under the condition of darkness, in the absence of catalysts, or in Ar, suggesting CO originated from photocatalytic CO2 reduction over Bi2Sn2O7 NPs under Xe lamp irradiation.To further firmly identify the carbon source of CO, 13 C isotopic labeling experiment was performed using 13 CO2 as the reactant. The signal of 13 CO can be obviously identified, which is corresponded to the peak at m/z29 in To reveal the mechanism and reaction intermediates in CO2 conversion process, in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was performed (Figure 3d).Due to the coadsorption of CO2 and H2O, the signals of monodentate carbonate groups (m-CO3 2-) can be well identified at 1526 cm -1 , while the peak at 1327 cm -1 can be assigned to symmetric O-C-O stretches of bidentate carbonate (b-CO3 2-). 28,29 he signature peak of carbonxylate (CO2 -) can be observed at 1249 cm -1 . 7tably, the peaks at 1570 cm The specific intermediate converts to CO by a further protonation process.5) Finally, CO will be desorbed from the surface of Bi2Sn2O7 NPs.DFT calculation was carried out to reveal the photocatalytic nature of CO2-to-CO conversion (Figure 4).Both activation of adsorbed CO2 and formation of COOH required external energy for perfect Bi2Sn2O7.After the introduction of oxygen vacancies, both the aforementioned 2 steps turn to a highly exergonic process, suggesting the introduction of oxygen vacancy can significantly promote the activation of CO2 and stabilize COOH intermediates.The desorption of CO is the potential limiting step for both the photoreduction process over perfect Bi2Sn2O7 and oxygen vacancy mediated Bi2Sn2O7.However, the engineered oxygen vacancy can effectively lower the desorption energy CO, from 3.22 to 2.39 eV, beneficial to the CO desorption."}], "reaction medium": [{"llm generation": "Gas", "source": "These two factors together contributed to the 8.1 times boosted photocatalytic performance of Bi2Sn2O7 NPs towards CO2-to-CO conversion, in which the CO formation rate can arrive 14.88 mol g -1 h -1 .", "context": "In summary, Bi2Sn2O7 NPs with enriched oxygen vacancies have been successfully prepared via a surfactant polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) assisted hydrothermal method.Oxygen vacancies significantly promote the activation of CO2 and stabilization of COOH intermediates, meanwhile, lower the energy barrier of potential determining step, the desorption of CO.Besides, the ultra-small structure significantly accelerated the speed of bulk charge diffusion.These two factors together contributed to the 8.1 times boosted photocatalytic performance of Bi2Sn2O7 NPs towards CO2-to-CO conversion, in which the CO formation rate can arrive 14.88 mol g -1 h -1 .This study holds significant promise for the design and synthesis of ultra-small semiconductor catalysts with -0457.The broad diffraction peaks of NPs indicate the nanosized features of NPs.Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of Bi2Sn2O7 Figure1e, f, g reveal continuous and ordered lattice fringes with d spacing of 0.257 nm and 0.338 nm, which are consistent with the (029) and(1 1 5) plane of Bi2Sn2O7, respectively.The intact ordered Bi and Sn atoms suggest no metal vacancies formed on the surface.Oxygen vacancies are hardly be directly observed from HAADF-STEM due to Z contrast difference between fairly light O and heavier Bi and Sn atoms.Elemental mapping analysis of the STEM results demonstrate the homogeneous dispersion of Sn, O and Bi elements (Figure1h).Conclusively, XRD, TEM, AFM, coupled with HAADF-STEM together provide solid evidence of the ultra-small nanoparticle morphology of Bi2Sn2O7.
