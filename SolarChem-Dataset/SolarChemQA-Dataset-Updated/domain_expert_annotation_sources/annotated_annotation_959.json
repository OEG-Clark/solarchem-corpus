To further determine the presence of g-C 3 N 4 , SnS 2 and Au, the bonding state and surface electronic state of the synthetic materials are characterized by XPS.The full spectrum of Fig. 2a confirmed the existence of Sn, S, C, N and Au elements, and the peak positions of Sn 3d, S 2p, C 1s, N 1s and Au 4f coincide with the standard peaks.In Fig. 2b, the Sn 3d spectra of pure SnS 2 has two diverse peaks, with the central peaks at 486.67 eV and 495.10 eV due to Sn 3d 3/2 and Sn 3d 5/2 , proving that Sn element exists in the chemical form of Sn 4 43.It is worth noting that after combining with g-C 3 N 4 , the Sn 3d 3/2 and Sn 3d 5/2 slightly downshift to 486.12 eV and 494.55 eV thank to the increase in the electronic density of Sn 4 44.At the same time, the introduction of Au nanoparticles in SnS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 caused a slight downward shift in the bond energy position, leading to an increase in the electron density of the material 45.In Fig. 2c, the central binding energies at 161.72 eV and 162.90 eV are attributed to S 2p 3/2 and S 2p 1/2 , respectively 46.With the introduction of g-C 3 N 4 and Au nanoparticles, a slight change in the bond energy position corresponds to a change in electron density.Meanwhile, the small peak at the position of 164.21 eV indicates the existence of S-N bonds, which further confirms the formation of SnS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 embedded heterojunction 32.The C 1s electron energy spectra was indicated in Fig. 2d, the g-C 3 N 4 , SnS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 and SnS 2 /Au/g-C 3 N 4 are fitted to two peaks at approximately 284.40-284.57and 287.87-288.27eV, which may originate from CeC and NeCN, respectively 47.The N 1s of the core level spectra in Fig. 2e, the four peaks of pure g-C 3 N 4 fitted by N 1s spectra are at 398.32, 399.77, 400.78 and 404.15 eV, which are attributed to NeH, Ne(C) 3 , CeNC and -excitations, respectively 37.The triazine ring' the sp 2 -hybrid nitrogen exists in the form of C-NC, the tertiary nitrogen is coupled to three carbon in the form of Ne(C) 3 , insufficient thermal polycondensation and CN conjugated structures' excitation lead to the formation of amino CeNeH bonds 48.Fig. 2f displays the XPS spectra of Au 4f, the energy spectra at 83.35 eV and 87.02 eV correspond to Au 4f 5/2 and Au 4f 7/2 , respectively; indicating the existence of Au 0 in the sample 49.The above analysis further suggests that the embedded heterojunction has been triumphantly synthesized, and Au may serve as carrier transmission bridge between two semiconductors, thereby improving the efficiency of carrier separation.The embedded heterojunction proved by XPS corresponds to the result of XRD analysis. Raman spectroscopy is commonly used to study the vibration characteristics and phase composition of materials.According to the Raman spectra of pure g-C 3 N 4 (Fig. 3), the obvious peaks are situated in 475 cm -1 , 705 cm -1 , 975 cm -1 and 1234 cm -1 , corresponding to the vibration mode of the CN heterocyclic ring in g-C 3 N 4 39.In addition, in the SnS 2 and SnS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 composites, the apparent peak at 314 cm -1 coincides with the out-of-plane tensile A 1g vibration mode of SnS 2 , which means that SnS 2 successfully grows on the surface of g-C 3 N 4 50.Interestingly, the peak of the Sn-S bond in the Raman spectra of SnS 2 /Au/g-C 3 N 4 is significantly reduced, which further indicates that the Au species may embed in the middle of two types of semiconductors and acts as a bridge for carrier transfer 51. To ascertain the surface composition and functional groups of the sample, FT-IR used to explore and analyze the samples.The wide absorption band at 3100-3400 cm -1 is attributed to the N-H and O-H vibration modes (Fig. 4a), which come from uncondensed amine groups on the surface and adsorbed water molecules 44.The spike at 811 cm -1 is the triazine ring's characteristic vibration bending out of the plane.The absorption bands at 1635 cm -1 and 1572 cm -1 can be assigned to the CN stretching.In Fig. 4b, the absorption bands at 1463, 1411, 1326, and 1254 cm -1 may be ascribed to C-N.Interestingly, the typical graphitized structure of carbon nitride is well preserved after g-C 3 N 4 is introduced homogeneously.However, the peak at about 3100-3400 cm -1 is wider and stronger than g-C 3 N 4 .In addition, the absorption band at 811 cm -1 became sharper, indicating that more uncondensed amino and hydroxyl groups are fell off or replaced 52.The position of SnS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 material is slightly red-shifted relative to g-C 3 N 4 .The g-C 3 N 4 conjugate structure is stretched to form a highly conjugated system, the reason may be that the introduced g-C 3 N 4 establishes a surface chemical bond through the formation of S-N, which causes the significant charge transmission between SnS 2 and g-C 3 N 4 53.Moreover, the addition of g-C 3 N 4 did not alter the chemical structure of SnS 2 , further explaining the formation of embedded structure. The morphology and crystal structure of the prepared materials are confirmed by drawing photograph with SEM, TEM, AFM, HRTEM and EDX.Fig. 5a and5b show the obtained TEM images of g-C 3 N 4 and SnS 2 , respectively.The results show that g-C 3 N 4 and SnS 2 self-assemble to form 2D sheet structure.Meanwhile, the average thickness of g-C 3 N 4 is about 9 nm, and the average thickness of SnS 2 is about 10 nm, which provides a good platform for the successful loading of nanoparticles (Fig. S1).As shown in Fig. 5c, SnS 2 forms a face-to-face embedded structure under the control of different molar ratios of g-C 3 N 4 and finds the optimal molar ratio for maximum activity.Fig. 5d displays the TEM of the prepared SnS 2 /Au/g-C 3 N 4 .The Au nanoparticles in the composite material have good dispersibility, which it retains a good surfacesurface embedded structure after modification with Au nanoparticles 54.The SEM image shown in Fig. S2 clearly shows regular g-C 3 N 4 and SnS 2 nanoflakes.SEM image and Mapping analysis of SnS 2 /Au/g-C 3 N 4 are shown in Fig. 5e-j.Mapping images show the uniform distribution of Sn, S, C, N and Au elements (Fig. 5 f,g,h,i,j), confirming the successful preparation of nanocomposites, and most of the introduced Au nanoparticles exist between two nanoscale semiconductors.In the EDS image (Fig. 51), the Sn, S, C, N and Au elements are further confirmed in the prepared hybrid material.The HRTEM is displayed in Fig. 5k, the heterojunction and crystal form of the synthesized SnS 2 / Au/g-C 3 N 4 can be obviously observed, and it matches commendably with SnS 2 and Au nanoparticles; The lattice spacing is 0.31 nm and 0.24 nm correspond to the typical SnS 2 crystal plane (1 0 0) and the classical Au nanoparticles crystal plane (1 1 1) 34.In addition, the SAED characterization of the SnS 2 /Au/g-C 3 N 4 (Fig. 5m), the polycrystalline structure of the material is characterized by concentric rings and scattering diffraction patterns, which corresponds to the XRD results 43, further confirming the successful preparation of embedded structure. To ascertain the position of the semiconductor band edge relative to the redox potential of the reaction, one further studied its optical absorption characteristics by UV-visible diffuse reflection method.Fig. 6a shows the UV-vis DRS of g-C 3 N 4 , SnS 2 , SnS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 and SnS 2 /Au/g-C 3 N 4 samples and the Kubelka-Munk equation based on direct band gap material of F(R )h 1/2 -h conversion to calculate forbidden band width (E g ) of semiconductors 55.Pure g-C 3 N 4 and pure SnS 2 samples show strong light absorption at about 450 nm and 530 nm, which correspond to the band gaps of approximately 2.71 eV and 2.12 eV, respectively (in the inset of Fig. 6a), corresponding to the previous reports 56.Different from the absorption state of sole g-C 3 N 4 and pure SnS 2 , the obtained SnS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 composite shows an extensive scope of light absorption and a powerful absorption peak, which is resulted by the hybridization of g-C 3 N 4 and SnS 2 .Obviously, after the introduction of Au nanoparticles, SnS 2 /Au/g-C 3 N 4 composites displayed wider absorption of light than SnS 2 and SnS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 , which makes clear that Au nanoparticles can significantly broaden range of light absorption and may further enhance the separation of carriers.The effective masses of the conduction band's bottom and the valence band's top are derived from the band structure.Especially, the opposing energy levels of the CBM (conduction band minimum) and VBM (valence band maximum) have an important effect on the redox ability of light-induced carriers in photo-reduction systems 57.To further make sure the position of the band edge of the reaction redox potential, one measured its VB position using valence band spectra (VBs).The VB maximum of g-C 3 N 4 and SnS 2 are 1.48 eV and 1.52 eV, respectively (Fig. 6b).According to the band gap in the inset of Fig. 6a and the position of the XPS VB measured in Fig. 6b, the near band edge locations of g-C 3 N 4 and SnS 2 are plotted relative to normal hydrogen electrode.As can be seen from Fig. S3, both samples have the ability to simultaneously reduce CO 2 and release O 2 .Besides, the location of CB of g-C 3 N 4 and SnS 2 is further characterized by Mote Nitro curves.As shown in Fig. S4 (a,b), the positions of conduction bands of pure g-C 3 N 4 and pure SnS 2 are -0.15eV and -0.55 eV, which are fundamentally the same as empirical formula 58.Besides, the total DOS and energy band structure of SnS 2 /Au/g-C 3 N 4 embedded heterostructure are calculated (Fig. 6c).The interaction between SnS 2 and g-C 3 N 4 results in the energy band levels being interlaced, which is the experimental test result of the energy band structure is consistent.The interlaced energy level of SnS 2 /Au/g-C 3 N 4 embedded heterostructure can promote the separation of photogenerated carriers, thus effectively improving the photocatalytic activity.In the light of the IUPAC classification, the relative pressure (p/p 0 ) is in the range of 0.2-0.859, the sample appeared a typical H3 hysteresis loop and a typical type IV isotherm, indicating the presence of mesopores 60.Table S1 shows the relationship between specific surface area (SSA) and morphology.For pure g-C 3 N 4 , the SSA and total pore volume are 60.865 m 2 g -1 and 0.232 cm 3 g -1 ; for pure SnS 2 , it is 69.941 m 2 g -1 and 0.382 cm 3 g -1 ; for SnS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 , it is 73.276 m 2 g -1 and 0.391 cm 3 g -1 ; for SnS 2 /Au/g-C 3 N 4 , it is 109.061m 2 g -1 and 0.663 cm 3 g -1 .It can be distinctly shown that the ultra-thin two-dimensional structure of g-C 3 N 4 and the size of Au nanoparticles improve the dispersion of SnS 2 materials, resulting in most of SnS 2 being effectively activated and utilized, which is beneficial for CO 2 adsorption 32.All the results show that g-C 3 N 4 and Au nanoparticles combine well with SnS 2 to form embedded structure, and the increased SSA is conducive to generating more active sites and adsorbing more saturated gas on its surface, enhancing photocatalytic activity. To research the effect of the introduced g-C 3 N 4 and Au nanoparticles on the carrier separation and recombination behavior, the photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy study is conducted.Fig. 7a displays the PL spectrum of g-C 3 N 4 , SnS 2 , SnS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 and SnS 2 /Au/g-C 3 N 4 samples.Pure SnS 2 material shows weak blue emission at 463 nm under 375 nm excitation, and pure g-C 3 N 4 material shows strong purple emission at 433 nm under 375 nm excitation, which is chiefly due to the tall free recombination rate of g-C 3 N 4 52,61.Moreover, the signal peak of pure g-C 3 N 4 is higher than that of SnS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 composite materials, showing that the recombination of SnS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 is lower than that of pure g-C 3 N 4 .After the addition of Au nanoparticles, the luminous intensity of SnS 2 /Au/g-C 3 N 4 is obviously smaller than that of SnS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 , because it extends the life of carrier and reduces the recombination of carrier, implying that SnS 2/ Au/g-C 3 N 4 composites have high activity, which is ascribed to the electron transmission achieved by the spatial expansion of Au nanoparticles and the embedded conjugate system 62.As shown in Fig. 7b, the fluorescence lifetimes of g-C 3 N 4 , SnS 2 , SnS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 , and SnS 2 /Au/g-C 3 N 4 are tested by transient fluorescence spectrum.Compared with the other two photocatalysts, SnS 2 / Au/g-C 3 N 4 has a faster decay kinetics.The radiative lifetime has been counted by fitting the double exponential equation (Fig. 7b) 63.It serves to show that the lifetimes of the specimens are 2.80 ns, 3.30 ns, and 4.58 ns, respectively, of which the lifetime of emission (2.80 ns) of SnS 2 /Au/g-C 3 N 4 is shorter than that of g-C 3 N 4 (3.30ns) and SnS 2 /g- C 3 N 4 (4.58 ns), it shows that the number of electrons generated by excitation increases sharply and the migration is obviously accelerated.Synchronously, the obvious PL quenching and lifetime reduction indicate the transfer path of electrons formed by SnS 2 CB and holes formed by g-C 3 N 4 VB to Au nanoparticles 34.The relatively high decay life of the introduced g-C 3 N 4 indicates that the interface charge transfer is faster in photocatalytic systems.Meanwhile, for the introduction of Au nanoparticles, the effective interfacial electron transfer of the hybrid material was significantly accelerated thanks to the ultrafast electron transmission process and reduced recombination of carrier in SnS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 interface layer, this may be due to the construction of the embedded structure to shorten the diffusion time and reduce the average lifetime of carrier, so that they reach the site of the reaction prior to losing energy 15.In conclusion, the SnS 2 /Au/g-C 3 N 4 composite photocatalyst has the best photocatalytic activity under light irradiation. To better research the electron transport mechanism of the obtained materials, the photoelectrochemical performance of the photocatalyst is analyzed on the electrochemical workstation of the solar simulator (xenon lamp, 300 W).The response of photoelectric and LSV curve are shown in Fig. 8, the transient photocurrent responses of pure g-C 3 N 4 , pure SnS 2 , SnS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 and SnS 2 /Au/g-C 3 N 4 are measured in 1 M Na 2 SO 4 solution under simulated sunlight.SnS 2 /3ml-Au/g-C 3 N 4 show a stronger photocurrent response of transient, which is about twice that of SnS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 (Fig. 8a).This result suggests that Au nanoparticles play a vital role in efficient charge transfer, and ultimately photoexcitation electrons of Au nanoparticles also serve as one of the causes for enhancing the photoelectric response 64.Noticeably, the photocurrent loss (DI) is very small during light irradiation, which may be reasonably ascribed to electron consumption, including the recombination of carrier and electron capture by O 2 65.In addition, the electrochemical characteristics of pure g-C 3 N 4 , pure SnS 2 , SnS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 and SnS 2 /Au/g-C 3 N 4 electrodes are studied by measuring current and voltage (J-V, Fig. 8b).Generally speaking, high photocurrent signal means more effective transfer and separation of carriers, because photocurrent is mainly triggered by the diffusion of light-induced electrons.For the original g-C 3 N 4 and SnS 2 , the photocurrent signal increases slower than SnS 2 /Au/g-C 3 N 4 , and as the applied voltage increases, the difference becomes larger.Compared with the Ag/AgCl reference electrode, the photocurrent intensity increased and reached 0.80 mA cm -2 at 1.0 V, which was 4.3 times and 4.0 times higher than g-C 3 N 4 and SnS 2 , respectively, indicating that more electrons participated in the reduction of adsorbed CO 2 molecules 66.At the same time, the EIS test is analyzed (Fig. S6), the arc radius of the SnS 2 /3ml-Au/g-C 3 N 4 is smaller than the original g-C 3 N 4 , SnS 2 and SnS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 electrode arc radius, indicating that SnS 2 /3ml-Au/g-C 3 N 4 has a rapid response on the working electrode surface.Therefore, the above results further indicate that the introduction of g-C 3 N 4 and Au nanoparticles in the process of photoreduction of CO 2 can well promote photogenerated charge transfer, thereby enhancing the activity of photocatalyst. The photoreduction activity of the material is tested using gas chromatography under simulated sunlight using CO 2 as a model reactant.Before the test, the adsorption and desorption equilibrium of all materials was finished by magnetic stirring under closed dark conditions and without air for 20 min.The catalytic activity of the synthesized embedded SnS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 is not optimal (Fig. 9).By introducing different amounts of Au nanoparticles as a carrier for electron transport, the photocatalytic activity is significantly improved.Under simulated sunlight, the successfully synthesized SnS 2 /3ml-Au/g-C 3 N 4 material shows the best activity, and the yields of CO and CH 4 reached 469.07 mol/g and 374.89 mol/g at 5 h, respectively.When the excess dose of Au is about 5 ml and 7 ml, the photocatalytic performance is reduced, which may be due to the excessive Au nanoparticles glued to the surface of SnS 2 and g-C 3 N 4 limiting the light absorption of the catalyst and reducing the contact area under simulated CO 2 photoreduction process 67.Meanwhile, the contact angle of these photocatalysts was tested.As shown in Fig. S7, the hydrophilicity is in the sequence of g-C 3 N 4 SnS 2 SnS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 SnS 2 /Au/g-C 3 N 4 , the results show that the successfully synthesized ternary material is very soluble in water, it provided a good basis for photoreduction of CO 2 in water solvent 68; the CO 2 adsorption behavior is in the sequence of g-C 3 N 4 SnS 2 SnS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 SnS 2 /Au/g-C 3 N 4 (Fig. S8), the results show that the ternary composite material is favorable for CO 2 adsorption and exhibits better photocatalytic activity.In addition, the internal electric field formed in the SnS 2 /Au/g-C 3 N 4 embedded structure provides a fast transmission channel for Au nanoparticles, and the synergistic effect of the interface improves the photoelectric performance, and the same conclusion can be obtained from high resolution (Fig. 5k).The zeta potential (Table S2) characterization determines the polarity of the semiconductor surface charge and the increase in the absolute value of the potential indicates that the system tends to be more stable.As such, the enhancement of SnS 2 /Au/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalytic activity is thanks to the existence and uniform distribution of Au nanoparticles, and with the emergence of more carriers and excited electrons, SnS 2 /3ml-Au/g-C 3 N 4 showed the best activity for CO 2 photoreduction under the sunlight irradiation 69.Meanwhile, it is found that there is a trace of hydrogen in the reaction process through the TCD detection, but it may be directly burned in the FID detection, resulting in the absence of hydrogen peaks in the gas chromatography (Fig. S9).Analysis of liquid-phase products by LC-MS revealed that no carbon-containing products are detected in the reaction products except for the sacrificial agent TEOA.This may be because there were no other carbon-containing products or the content was too low to detect. As we all know, reusability and stability are significant criteria for judging the photocatalysts' quality and further energy application.The composite material also has good cycle performance, which has been proved to perform six consecutive photocatalytic reduction CO 2 cycle experiments on SnS 2 /Au/g-C 3 N 4 samples.The experimental results (Fig. S10), we can expressly see that the photocatalytic efficiency of SnS 2 /Au/g-C 3 N 4 decreased slightly during the six photoactivity tests for CO 2 reduction under the UV-vis irradiation, and almost no deactivation 70.To further research the photocatalyst stability, Fig. S10 shows the XRD of SnS 2 /3ml-Au/g-C 3 N 4 before and after six consecutive CO 2 solution reduction experiments.The main characteristic diffraction peak of SnS 2 /3ml-Au/g-C 3 N 4 is almost in the same position as the standard diffraction peak pattern, indicating that the structure composition has not altered after the cycle test.Furthermore, the intensity of the photocatalyst is slightly reduced compared to the sample before repeated photoreduction.Therefore, the prepared SnS 2 /Au/g-C 3 N 4 can be identified as a stable photocatalyst, and Au nanoparticles play a vital role in exciting electrons and enhancing photo-generated carrier for effective separation 71. In order to further determine the active substance of the photocatalytic process, electron spin resonance (ESR) was used to verify the existence of hydroxyl radicals (OH) and superoxide radicals (O 2 -) in the photocatalyst under UV-vis light illumination 35.Fig. 10 shows that before and during simulation sunlight exposure, the ESR spectrum contains various capture agents from g-C 3 N 4 , SnS 2 , SnS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 and SnS 2 /Au/g-C 3 N 4 hybrid materials.As a comparison, different materials were subjected to the same ESR test.Obviously, before the lamp is lit, there is no diffraction peak in Fig. 10 (a,b).However, when the lamp is on, the characteristic peaks of g-C 3 N 4 , SnS 2 , SnS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 and SnS 2 /Au/ g-C 3 N 4 spectra in Fig. 10 with electrons and H to obtain OH radicals, where H originated from the water's ionization 73.The introduction of g-C 3 N 4 and Au nanoparticles respectively significantly enhanced the peak intensity of these two free radicals, which indirectly proves that the catalyst activity of SnS 2 /Au/g-C 3 N 4 is better than g-C 3 N 4 , SnS 2 and SnS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 . According to the above results, compared with the photoactivity of g-C 3 N 4 , SnS 2 , SnS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 , SnS 2 /3ml-Au/g-C 3 N 4 hybrid nanomaterials show the best photocatalytic activity and have obvious enhancement signals in the generation of superoxides, hydroxyl groups, and lightinduced cavities, which are related to the face-to-face embedded heterojunction formed by g-C 3 N 4 and the uniformly distributed Au nanoparticles.Noteworthily, the face-to-face 2D embedded structure formed by SnS 2 and g-C 3 N 4 not only forms an internal electric field at the interface, but also provides a good channel for the rapid transmission of electrons 74.In addition, Au nanoparticles act as a bridge for electron transmission and generate more excited electrons, thereby speeding up electron transport and increasing the catalytic activity of the composite 75.According to the energy band engineering, the band positions of g-C 3 N 4 and SnS 2 are computed by empirical formulas (E CB E VB -E g and E VB X -E e 0.5E g ) 76.The CB and VB of pure SnS 2 with forbidden band width (E g 2.12 eV) are computed to be -0.52 and 1.60 eV (relative to NHE, Fig. 11a), respectively.The conduction and valence band edges of pure g-C 3 N 4 with a wide band gap width (E g 2.71 eV) are calculated to be -1.50 and 1.21 eV (relative to NHE), respectively.It is crisply seen through DRS that the band gap of SnS 2 becomes markedly narrowed behind the introduction of g-C 3 N 4 (Fig. 6a).Therefore, the absorption range of the wavelength is extended, enhancing the visible light's absorption.Noticeably, after the formation of SnS 2 /Au/g-C 3 N 4 embedded heterojunction, the CB location of the hybrid SnS 2 is lower, which the VB location is smaller than the positive value of original SnS 2 .An analogous trend can be saw in the catalytic activity in Fig. 9.Moreover, the CB and VB values of semiconductors decide the intensity and type of ROS produced by light excitation 77.Besides, in terms of thermodynamic viewpoint, both semiconductors have the ability to be photoexcited and then reduce CO 2 to CO and CH 4 .However, as shown in Fig. S11, SnS 2 was incapable of generating CH 4 even after long irradiation (400), suggesting that effective accumulation and extraction of photoinduced electrons in SnS 2 are not allowed, most likely due to fast charge recombination.For the SnS 2 /Au/g-C 3 N 4 hybrid, if electrons transferred through the conventional heterojunction route, the photoinduced electrons of g-C 3 N 4 would transfer to the CB of SnS 2 .Consequently, CH 4 will not be produced.Meanwhile, when irradiated by the visible light, e --h pairs are photogenerated in SnS 2 and g-C 3 N 4 .The photoexcited h probably remain in SnS 2 VB, whereas the e -in SnS 2 CB transfers to VB of g-C 3 N 4 due to ohmic contact.The e -in g-C 3 N 4 VB is further stimulated to its CB, which is beneficial to improve the efficiency towards the separation of e --h pairs.The h stored in SnS 2 VB is trapped in H 2 O molecule to produce H and O 2 .Simultaneously, the e -in g-C 3 N 4 CB is transmitted to its surface, which can increase the e -density of g-C 3 N 4 .The Z-type heterojunction constructed by SnS 2 /Au/g-C 3 N 4 provides more photogenerated carriers and active substances, which has a similar trend to the signal in the ESR spectrum in Fig. 10 78,79.Notably, as revealed by the Zeta potential diagram (Table S2), the electric field inside the interface formed by the electrostatic interaction of the two semiconductors inevitably affects the electron transport, thereby changing the photocatalytic activity of the material 38.In addition, We further studied the difference in charge density of SnS 2 /Au/g-C 3 N 4 embedded heterostructure.The calculated charge density difference is shown in Fig. 11b.At the interface of SnS 2 /Au/g-C 3 N 4 embedded heterostructure, the surface of g-C 3 N 4 is mainly dominated by green areas, slightly covered by purple areas, and the surface of SnS 2 is mainly filled by purple areas, partly occupied by the green area. On the basic of the above consequence, the reasonable mechanism of the system to tremendously heighten the catalyst performance of visible light driving can be ascribed to the following sides: (1) The use of a specific energy band structure coupled with g-C 3 N 4 expands the light absorption range and utilization.In addition, the Z-type mechanism constructed to provide more photogenerated electrons and holes pairs to participate in the process of photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 ; (2) Here, Au nanoparticles enter the SnS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 embedded structure, which utilizes the good conductivity of Au nanoparticles to provide a channel for carrier transport.When excited by light, Au nanoparticles produce more excited electrons, and photogenerated electrons are more easily transferred in CB of SnS 2 due to sufficient energy to cause electron transitions in the HOMO level.The internal electric field of the interface formed by the SnS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 embedded lay structure plays an important role in it."}, {"llm generation": "Solar Simulator", "source": "Reduction of CO 2 by g-C 3 N 4 , SnS 2 , SnS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 and SnS 2 /Au/g-C 3 N 4 under simulated sunlight.", "context": "In summary, the SnS 2 doped with carbon and nitrogen hybridization during the experimental synthesis proved the successful coupling of g- Scheme 1.(a) Schematic diagram of the formation of SnS 2 /Au/g-C 3 N 4 synthesis process; (b) DOS of SnS 2 /Au/g-C 3 N 4 ; (c) Top view and side view of SnS 2 /Au/g-C 3 N 4 embedded heterostructure after geometry optimization.

Observed obvious face-to-face SnS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 embedded layer morphology, and the uniformly distributed Au nanoparticles improved the conductivity of hybrid photocatalysts.The representative detection of SnS 2 /Au/g-C 3 N 4 during light excitation has been studied by PL spectroscopy.The energy band structure based on g-C 3 N 4 material though efficient modulation, the synthesized SnS 2 /Au/g-C 3 N 4 exhibited significant photoexcitation in photo-living oxygen; OH and O 2 -are the main active substances and the formation Z-type mechanism generates more electrons when excited by light, thereby improving the reaction efficiency.The FE-TEM clearly shows the SnS 2 /Au/g-C 3 N 4 embedded structure.This work delivers a novel tactics for the construction of the internal electric field thanks to electrostatic interaction of the interface of 2D semiconductors.Meanwhile, photocurrent, impedance, LSV curve, steady-state fluorescence and transient fluorescence results show that Au nanoparticles not only act as a bridge for electron transport in 2D semiconductor materials to accelerate electron transport, but generate more excited electrons by themselves, which effectively boosts the separation of carriers and enhances the catalyst activity.In addition, DFT calculations show that the Z-type mechanism and the intercalated energy level of the SnS 2 /Au/g-C 3 N 4 embedded structure expand the light absorption and improve the carrier separation efficiency.

To further determine the presence of g-C 3 N 4 , SnS 2 and Au, the bonding state and surface electronic state of the synthetic materials are characterized by XPS.The full spectrum of Fig. 2a confirmed the existence of Sn, S, C, N and Au elements, and the peak positions of Sn 3d, S 2p, C 1s, N 1s and Au 4f coincide with the standard peaks.In Fig. 2b, the Sn 3d spectra of pure SnS 2 has two diverse peaks, with the central peaks at 486.67 eV and 495.10 eV due to Sn 3d 3/2 and Sn 3d 5/2 , proving that Sn element exists in the chemical form of Sn 4 43.It is worth noting that after combining with g-C 3 N 4 , the Sn 3d 3/2 and Sn 3d 5/2 slightly downshift to 486.12 eV and 494.55 eV thank to the increase in the electronic density of Sn 4 44.At the same time, the introduction of Au nanoparticles in SnS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 caused a slight downward shift in the bond energy position, leading to an increase in the electron density of the material 45.In Fig. 2c, the central binding energies at 161.72 eV and 162.90 eV are attributed to S 2p 3/2 and S 2p 1/2 , respectively 46.With the introduction of g-C 3 N 4 and Au nanoparticles, a slight change in the bond energy position corresponds to a change in electron density.Meanwhile, the small peak at the position of 164.21 eV indicates the existence of S-N bonds, which further confirms the formation of SnS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 embedded heterojunction 32.The C 1s electron energy spectra was indicated in Fig. 2d, the g-C 3 N 4 , SnS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 and SnS 2 /Au/g-C 3 N 4 are fitted to two peaks at approximately 284.40-284.57and 287.87-288.27eV, which may originate from CeC and NeCN, respectively 47.The N 1s of the core level spectra in Fig. 2e, the four peaks of pure g-C 3 N 4 fitted by N 1s spectra are at 398.32, 399.77, 400.78 and 404.15 eV, which are attributed to NeH, Ne(C) 3 , CeNC and -excitations, respectively 37.The triazine ring' the sp 2 -hybrid nitrogen exists in the form of C-NC, the tertiary nitrogen is coupled to three carbon in the form of Ne(C) 3 , insufficient thermal polycondensation and CN conjugated structures' excitation lead to the formation of amino CeNeH bonds 48.Fig. 2f displays the XPS spectra of Au 4f, the energy spectra at 83.35 eV and 87.02 eV correspond to Au 4f 5/2 and Au 4f 7/2 , respectively; indicating the existence of Au 0 in the sample 49.The above analysis further suggests that the embedded heterojunction has been triumphantly synthesized, and Au may serve as carrier transmission bridge between two semiconductors, thereby improving the efficiency of carrier separation.The embedded heterojunction proved by XPS corresponds to the result of XRD analysis. Raman spectroscopy is commonly used to study the vibration characteristics and phase composition of materials.According to the Raman spectra of pure g-C 3 N 4 (Fig. 3), the obvious peaks are situated in 475 cm -1 , 705 cm -1 , 975 cm -1 and 1234 cm -1 , corresponding to the vibration mode of the CN heterocyclic ring in g-C 3 N 4 39.In addition, in the SnS 2 and SnS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 composites, the apparent peak at 314 cm -1 coincides with the out-of-plane tensile A 1g vibration mode of SnS 2 , which means that SnS 2 successfully grows on the surface of g-C 3 N 4 50.Interestingly, the peak of the Sn-S bond in the Raman spectra of SnS 2 /Au/g-C 3 N 4 is significantly reduced, which further indicates that the Au species may embed in the middle of two types of semiconductors and acts as a bridge for carrier transfer 51. To ascertain the surface composition and functional groups of the sample, FT-IR used to explore and analyze the samples.The wide absorption band at 3100-3400 cm -1 is attributed to the N-H and O-H vibration modes (Fig. 4a), which come from uncondensed amine groups on the surface and adsorbed water molecules 44.The spike at 811 cm -1 is the triazine ring's characteristic vibration bending out of the plane.The absorption bands at 1635 cm -1 and 1572 cm -1 can be assigned to the CN stretching.In Fig. 4b, the absorption bands at 1463, 1411, 1326, and 1254 cm -1 may be ascribed to C-N.Interestingly, the typical graphitized structure of carbon nitride is well preserved after g-C 3 N 4 is introduced homogeneously.However, the peak at about 3100-3400 cm -1 is wider and stronger than g-C 3 N 4 .In addition, the absorption band at 811 cm -1 became sharper, indicating that more uncondensed amino and hydroxyl groups are fell off or replaced 52.The position of SnS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 material is slightly red-shifted relative to g-C 3 N 4 .The g-C 3 N 4 conjugate structure is stretched to form a highly conjugated system, the reason may be that the introduced g-C 3 N 4 establishes a surface chemical bond through the formation of S-N, which causes the significant charge transmission between SnS 2 and g-C 3 N 4 53.Moreover, the addition of g-C 3 N 4 did not alter the chemical structure of SnS 2 , further explaining the formation of embedded structure. The morphology and crystal structure of the prepared materials are confirmed by drawing photograph with SEM, TEM, AFM, HRTEM and EDX.Fig. 5a and5b show the obtained TEM images of g-C 3 N 4 and SnS 2 , respectively.The results show that g-C 3 N 4 and SnS 2 self-assemble to form 2D sheet structure.Meanwhile, the average thickness of g-C 3 N 4 is about 9 nm, and the average thickness of SnS 2 is about 10 nm, which provides a good platform for the successful loading of nanoparticles (Fig. S1).As shown in Fig. 5c, SnS 2 forms a face-to-face embedded structure under the control of different molar ratios of g-C 3 N 4 and finds the optimal molar ratio for maximum activity.Fig. 5d displays the TEM of the prepared SnS 2 /Au/g-C 3 N 4 .The Au nanoparticles in the composite material have good dispersibility, which it retains a good surfacesurface embedded structure after modification with Au nanoparticles 54.The SEM image shown in Fig. S2 clearly shows regular g-C 3 N 4 and SnS 2 nanoflakes.SEM image and Mapping analysis of SnS 2 /Au/g-C 3 N 4 are shown in Fig. 5e-j.Mapping images show the uniform distribution of Sn, S, C, N and Au elements (Fig. 5 f,g,h,i,j), confirming the successful preparation of nanocomposites, and most of the introduced Au nanoparticles exist between two nanoscale semiconductors.In the EDS image (Fig. 51), the Sn, S, C, N and Au elements are further confirmed in the prepared hybrid material.The HRTEM is displayed in Fig. 5k, the heterojunction and crystal form of the synthesized SnS 2 / Au/g-C 3 N 4 can be obviously observed, and it matches commendably with SnS 2 and Au nanoparticles; The lattice spacing is 0.31 nm and 0.24 nm correspond to the typical SnS 2 crystal plane (1 0 0) and the classical Au nanoparticles crystal plane (1 1 1) 34.In addition, the SAED characterization of the SnS 2 /Au/g-C 3 N 4 (Fig. 5m), the polycrystalline structure of the material is characterized by concentric rings and scattering diffraction patterns, which corresponds to the XRD results 43, further confirming the successful preparation of embedded structure. To ascertain the position of the semiconductor band edge relative to the redox potential of the reaction, one further studied its optical absorption characteristics by UV-visible diffuse reflection method.Fig. 6a shows the UV-vis DRS of g-C 3 N 4 , SnS 2 , SnS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 and SnS 2 /Au/g-C 3 N 4 samples and the Kubelka-Munk equation based on direct band gap material of F(R )h 1/2 -h conversion to calculate forbidden band width (E g ) of semiconductors 55.Pure g-C 3 N 4 and pure SnS 2 samples show strong light absorption at about 450 nm and 530 nm, which correspond to the band gaps of approximately 2.71 eV and 2.12 eV, respectively (in the inset of Fig. 6a), corresponding to the previous reports 56.Different from the absorption state of sole g-C 3 N 4 and pure SnS 2 , the obtained SnS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 composite shows an extensive scope of light absorption and a powerful absorption peak, which is resulted by the hybridization of g-C 3 N 4 and SnS 2 .Obviously, after the introduction of Au nanoparticles, SnS 2 /Au/g-C 3 N 4 composites displayed wider absorption of light than SnS 2 and SnS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 , which makes clear that Au nanoparticles can significantly broaden range of light absorption and may further enhance the separation of carriers.The effective masses of the conduction band's bottom and the valence band's top are derived from the band structure.Especially, the opposing energy levels of the CBM (conduction band minimum) and VBM (valence band maximum) have an important effect on the redox ability of light-induced carriers in photo-reduction systems 57.To further make sure the position of the band edge of the reaction redox potential, one measured its VB position using valence band spectra (VBs).The VB maximum of g-C 3 N 4 and SnS 2 are 1.48 eV and 1.52 eV, respectively (Fig. 6b).According to the band gap in the inset of Fig. 6a and the position of the XPS VB measured in Fig. 6b, the near band edge locations of g-C 3 N 4 and SnS 2 are plotted relative to normal hydrogen electrode.As can be seen from Fig. S3, both samples have the ability to simultaneously reduce CO 2 and release O 2 .Besides, the location of CB of g-C 3 N 4 and SnS 2 is further characterized by Mote Nitro curves.As shown in Fig. S4 (a,b), the positions of conduction bands of pure g-C 3 N 4 and pure SnS 2 are -0.15eV and -0.55 eV, which are fundamentally the same as empirical formula 58.Besides, the total DOS and energy band structure of SnS 2 /Au/g-C 3 N 4 embedded heterostructure are calculated (Fig. 6c).The interaction between SnS 2 and g-C 3 N 4 results in the energy band levels being interlaced, which is the experimental test result of the energy band structure is consistent.The interlaced energy level of SnS 2 /Au/g-C 3 N 4 embedded heterostructure can promote the separation of photogenerated carriers, thus effectively improving the photocatalytic activity.In the light of the IUPAC classification, the relative pressure (p/p 0 ) is in the range of 0.2-0.859, the sample appeared a typical H3 hysteresis loop and a typical type IV isotherm, indicating the presence of mesopores 60.Table S1 shows the relationship between specific surface area (SSA) and morphology.For pure g-C 3 N 4 , the SSA and total pore volume are 60.865 m 2 g -1 and 0.232 cm 3 g -1 ; for pure SnS 2 , it is 69.941 m 2 g -1 and 0.382 cm 3 g -1 ; for SnS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 , it is 73.276 m 2 g -1 and 0.391 cm 3 g -1 ; for SnS 2 /Au/g-C 3 N 4 , it is 109.061m 2 g -1 and 0.663 cm 3 g -1 .It can be distinctly shown that the ultra-thin two-dimensional structure of g-C 3 N 4 and the size of Au nanoparticles improve the dispersion of SnS 2 materials, resulting in most of SnS 2 being effectively activated and utilized, which is beneficial for CO 2 adsorption 32.All the results show that g-C 3 N 4 and Au nanoparticles combine well with SnS 2 to form embedded structure, and the increased SSA is conducive to generating more active sites and adsorbing more saturated gas on its surface, enhancing photocatalytic activity. To research the effect of the introduced g-C 3 N 4 and Au nanoparticles on the carrier separation and recombination behavior, the photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy study is conducted.Fig. 7a displays the PL spectrum of g-C 3 N 4 , SnS 2 , SnS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 and SnS 2 /Au/g-C 3 N 4 samples.Pure SnS 2 material shows weak blue emission at 463 nm under 375 nm excitation, and pure g-C 3 N 4 material shows strong purple emission at 433 nm under 375 nm excitation, which is chiefly due to the tall free recombination rate of g-C 3 N 4 52,61.Moreover, the signal peak of pure g-C 3 N 4 is higher than that of SnS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 composite materials, showing that the recombination of SnS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 is lower than that of pure g-C 3 N 4 .After the addition of Au nanoparticles, the luminous intensity of SnS 2 /Au/g-C 3 N 4 is obviously smaller than that of SnS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 , because it extends the life of carrier and reduces the recombination of carrier, implying that SnS 2/ Au/g-C 3 N 4 composites have high activity, which is ascribed to the electron transmission achieved by the spatial expansion of Au nanoparticles and the embedded conjugate system 62.As shown in Fig. 7b, the fluorescence lifetimes of g-C 3 N 4 , SnS 2 , SnS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 , and SnS 2 /Au/g-C 3 N 4 are tested by transient fluorescence spectrum.Compared with the other two photocatalysts, SnS 2 / Au/g-C 3 N 4 has a faster decay kinetics.The radiative lifetime has been counted by fitting the double exponential equation (Fig. 7b) 63.It serves to show that the lifetimes of the specimens are 2.80 ns, 3.30 ns, and 4.58 ns, respectively, of which the lifetime of emission (2.80 ns) of SnS 2 /Au/g-C 3 N 4 is shorter than that of g-C 3 N 4 (3.30ns) and SnS 2 /g- C 3 N 4 (4.58 ns), it shows that the number of electrons generated by excitation increases sharply and the migration is obviously accelerated.Synchronously, the obvious PL quenching and lifetime reduction indicate the transfer path of electrons formed by SnS 2 CB and holes formed by g-C 3 N 4 VB to Au nanoparticles 34.The relatively high decay life of the introduced g-C 3 N 4 indicates that the interface charge transfer is faster in photocatalytic systems.Meanwhile, for the introduction of Au nanoparticles, the effective interfacial electron transfer of the hybrid material was significantly accelerated thanks to the ultrafast electron transmission process and reduced recombination of carrier in SnS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 interface layer, this may be due to the construction of the embedded structure to shorten the diffusion time and reduce the average lifetime of carrier, so that they reach the site of the reaction prior to losing energy 15.In conclusion, the SnS 2 /Au/g-C 3 N 4 composite photocatalyst has the best photocatalytic activity under light irradiation. To better research the electron transport mechanism of the obtained materials, the photoelectrochemical performance of the photocatalyst is analyzed on the electrochemical workstation of the solar simulator (xenon lamp, 300 W).The response of photoelectric and LSV curve are shown in Fig. 8, the transient photocurrent responses of pure g-C 3 N 4 , pure SnS 2 , SnS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 and SnS 2 /Au/g-C 3 N 4 are measured in 1 M Na 2 SO 4 solution under simulated sunlight.SnS 2 /3ml-Au/g-C 3 N 4 show a stronger photocurrent response of transient, which is about twice that of SnS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 (Fig. 8a).This result suggests that Au nanoparticles play a vital role in efficient charge transfer, and ultimately photoexcitation electrons of Au nanoparticles also serve as one of the causes for enhancing the photoelectric response 64.Noticeably, the photocurrent loss (DI) is very small during light irradiation, which may be reasonably ascribed to electron consumption, including the recombination of carrier and electron capture by O 2 65.In addition, the electrochemical characteristics of pure g-C 3 N 4 , pure SnS 2 , SnS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 and SnS 2 /Au/g-C 3 N 4 electrodes are studied by measuring current and voltage (J-V, Fig. 8b).Generally speaking, high photocurrent signal means more effective transfer and separation of carriers, because photocurrent is mainly triggered by the diffusion of light-induced electrons.For the original g-C 3 N 4 and SnS 2 , the photocurrent signal increases slower than SnS 2 /Au/g-C 3 N 4 , and as the applied voltage increases, the difference becomes larger.Compared with the Ag/AgCl reference electrode, the photocurrent intensity increased and reached 0.80 mA cm -2 at 1.0 V, which was 4.3 times and 4.0 times higher than g-C 3 N 4 and SnS 2 , respectively, indicating that more electrons participated in the reduction of adsorbed CO 2 molecules 66.At the same time, the EIS test is analyzed (Fig. S6), the arc radius of the SnS 2 /3ml-Au/g-C 3 N 4 is smaller than the original g-C 3 N 4 , SnS 2 and SnS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 electrode arc radius, indicating that SnS 2 /3ml-Au/g-C 3 N 4 has a rapid response on the working electrode surface.Therefore, the above results further indicate that the introduction of g-C 3 N 4 and Au nanoparticles in the process of photoreduction of CO 2 can well promote photogenerated charge transfer, thereby enhancing the activity of photocatalyst. The photoreduction activity of the material is tested using gas chromatography under simulated sunlight using CO 2 as a model reactant.Before the test, the adsorption and desorption equilibrium of all materials was finished by magnetic stirring under closed dark conditions and without air for 20 min.The catalytic activity of the synthesized embedded SnS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 is not optimal (Fig. 9).By introducing different amounts of Au nanoparticles as a carrier for electron transport, the photocatalytic activity is significantly improved.Under simulated sunlight, the successfully synthesized SnS 2 /3ml-Au/g-C 3 N 4 material shows the best activity, and the yields of CO and CH 4 reached 469.07 mol/g and 374.89 mol/g at 5 h, respectively.When the excess dose of Au is about 5 ml and 7 ml, the photocatalytic performance is reduced, which may be due to the excessive Au nanoparticles glued to the surface of SnS 2 and g-C 3 N 4 limiting the light absorption of the catalyst and reducing the contact area under simulated CO 2 photoreduction process 67.Meanwhile, the contact angle of these photocatalysts was tested.As shown in Fig. S7, the hydrophilicity is in the sequence of g-C 3 N 4 SnS 2 SnS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 SnS 2 /Au/g-C 3 N 4 , the results show that the successfully synthesized ternary material is very soluble in water, it provided a good basis for photoreduction of CO 2 in water solvent 68; the CO 2 adsorption behavior is in the sequence of g-C 3 N 4 SnS 2 SnS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 SnS 2 /Au/g-C 3 N 4 (Fig. S8), the results show that the ternary composite material is favorable for CO 2 adsorption and exhibits better photocatalytic activity.In addition, the internal electric field formed in the SnS 2 /Au/g-C 3 N 4 embedded structure provides a fast transmission channel for Au nanoparticles, and the synergistic effect of the interface improves the photoelectric performance, and the same conclusion can be obtained from high resolution (Fig. 5k).The zeta potential (Table S2) characterization determines the polarity of the semiconductor surface charge and the increase in the absolute value of the potential indicates that the system tends to be more stable.As such, the enhancement of SnS 2 /Au/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalytic activity is thanks to the existence and uniform distribution of Au nanoparticles, and with the emergence of more carriers and excited electrons, SnS 2 /3ml-Au/g-C 3 N 4 showed the best activity for CO 2 photoreduction under the sunlight irradiation 69.Meanwhile, it is found that there is a trace of hydrogen in the reaction process through the TCD detection, but it may be directly burned in the FID detection, resulting in the absence of hydrogen peaks in the gas chromatography (Fig. S9).Analysis of liquid-phase products by LC-MS revealed that no carbon-containing products are detected in the reaction products except for the sacrificial agent TEOA.This may be because there were no other carbon-containing products or the content was too low to detect. As we all know, reusability and stability are significant criteria for judging the photocatalysts' quality and further energy application.The composite material also has good cycle performance, which has been proved to perform six consecutive photocatalytic reduction CO 2 cycle experiments on SnS 2 /Au/g-C 3 N 4 samples.The experimental results (Fig. S10), we can expressly see that the photocatalytic efficiency of SnS 2 /Au/g-C 3 N 4 decreased slightly during the six photoactivity tests for CO 2 reduction under the UV-vis irradiation, and almost no deactivation 70.To further research the photocatalyst stability, Fig. S10 shows the XRD of SnS 2 /3ml-Au/g-C 3 N 4 before and after six consecutive CO 2 solution reduction experiments.The main characteristic diffraction peak of SnS 2 /3ml-Au/g-C 3 N 4 is almost in the same position as the standard diffraction peak pattern, indicating that the structure composition has not altered after the cycle test.Furthermore, the intensity of the photocatalyst is slightly reduced compared to the sample before repeated photoreduction.Therefore, the prepared SnS 2 /Au/g-C 3 N 4 can be identified as a stable photocatalyst, and Au nanoparticles play a vital role in exciting electrons and enhancing photo-generated carrier for effective separation 71. In order to further determine the active substance of the photocatalytic process, electron spin resonance (ESR) was used to verify the existence of hydroxyl radicals (OH) and superoxide radicals (O 2 -) in the photocatalyst under UV-vis light illumination 35.Fig. 10 shows that before and during simulation sunlight exposure, the ESR spectrum contains various capture agents from g-C 3 N 4 , SnS 2 , SnS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 and SnS 2 /Au/g-C 3 N 4 hybrid materials.As a comparison, different materials were subjected to the same ESR test.Obviously, before the lamp is lit, there is no diffraction peak in Fig. 10 (a,b).However, when the lamp is on, the characteristic peaks of g-C 3 N 4 , SnS 2 , SnS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 and SnS 2 /Au/ g-C 3 N 4 spectra in Fig. 10 with electrons and H to obtain OH radicals, where H originated from the water's ionization 73.The introduction of g-C 3 N 4 and Au nanoparticles respectively significantly enhanced the peak intensity of these two free radicals, which indirectly proves that the catalyst activity of SnS 2 /Au/g-C 3 N 4 is better than g-C 3 N 4 , SnS 2 and SnS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 . According to the above results, compared with the photoactivity of g-C 3 N 4 , SnS 2 , SnS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 , SnS 2 /3ml-Au/g-C 3 N 4 hybrid nanomaterials show the best photocatalytic activity and have obvious enhancement signals in the generation of superoxides, hydroxyl groups, and lightinduced cavities, which are related to the face-to-face embedded heterojunction formed by g-C 3 N 4 and the uniformly distributed Au nanoparticles.Noteworthily, the face-to-face 2D embedded structure formed by SnS 2 and g-C 3 N 4 not only forms an internal electric field at the interface, but also provides a good channel for the rapid transmission of electrons 74.In addition, Au nanoparticles act as a bridge for electron transmission and generate more excited electrons, thereby speeding up electron transport and increasing the catalytic activity of the composite 75.According to the energy band engineering, the band positions of g-C 3 N 4 and SnS 2 are computed by empirical formulas (E CB E VB -E g and E VB X -E e 0.5E g ) 76.The CB and VB of pure SnS 2 with forbidden band width (E g 2.12 eV) are computed to be -0.52 and 1.60 eV (relative to NHE, Fig. 11a), respectively.The conduction and valence band edges of pure g-C 3 N 4 with a wide band gap width (E g 2.71 eV) are calculated to be -1.50 and 1.21 eV (relative to NHE), respectively.It is crisply seen through DRS that the band gap of SnS 2 becomes markedly narrowed behind the introduction of g-C 3 N 4 (Fig. 6a).Therefore, the absorption range of the wavelength is extended, enhancing the visible light's absorption.Noticeably, after the formation of SnS 2 /Au/g-C 3 N 4 embedded heterojunction, the CB location of the hybrid SnS 2 is lower, which the VB location is smaller than the positive value of original SnS 2 .An analogous trend can be saw in the catalytic activity in Fig. 9.Moreover, the CB and VB values of semiconductors decide the intensity and type of ROS produced by light excitation 77.Besides, in terms of thermodynamic viewpoint, both semiconductors have the ability to be photoexcited and then reduce CO 2 to CO and CH 4 .However, as shown in Fig. S11, SnS 2 was incapable of generating CH 4 even after long irradiation (400), suggesting that effective accumulation and extraction of photoinduced electrons in SnS 2 are not allowed, most likely due to fast charge recombination.For the SnS 2 /Au/g-C 3 N 4 hybrid, if electrons transferred through the conventional heterojunction route, the photoinduced electrons of g-C 3 N 4 would transfer to the CB of SnS 2 .Consequently, CH 4 will not be produced.Meanwhile, when irradiated by the visible light, e --h pairs are photogenerated in SnS 2 and g-C 3 N 4 .The photoexcited h probably remain in SnS 2 VB, whereas the e -in SnS 2 CB transfers to VB of g-C 3 N 4 due to ohmic contact.The e -in g-C 3 N 4 VB is further stimulated to its CB, which is beneficial to improve the efficiency towards the separation of e --h pairs.The h stored in SnS 2 VB is trapped in H 2 O molecule to produce H and O 2 .Simultaneously, the e -in g-C 3 N 4 CB is transmitted to its surface, which can increase the e -density of g-C 3 N 4 .The Z-type heterojunction constructed by SnS 2 /Au/g-C 3 N 4 provides more photogenerated carriers and active substances, which has a similar trend to the signal in the ESR spectrum in Fig. 10 78,79.Notably, as revealed by the Zeta potential diagram (Table S2), the electric field inside the interface formed by the electrostatic interaction of the two semiconductors inevitably affects the electron transport, thereby changing the photocatalytic activity of the material 38.In addition, We further studied the difference in charge density of SnS 2 /Au/g-C 3 N 4 embedded heterostructure.The calculated charge density difference is shown in Fig. 11b.At the interface of SnS 2 /Au/g-C 3 N 4 embedded heterostructure, the surface of g-C 3 N 4 is mainly dominated by green areas, slightly covered by purple areas, and the surface of SnS 2 is mainly filled by purple areas, partly occupied by the green area. On the basic of the above consequence, the reasonable mechanism of the system to tremendously heighten the catalyst performance of visible light driving can be ascribed to the following sides: (1) The use of a specific energy band structure coupled with g-C 3 N 4 expands the light absorption range and utilization.In addition, the Z-type mechanism constructed to provide more photogenerated electrons and holes pairs to participate in the process of photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 ; (2) Here, Au nanoparticles enter the SnS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 embedded structure, which utilizes the good conductivity of Au nanoparticles to provide a channel for carrier transport.When excited by light, Au nanoparticles produce more excited electrons, and photogenerated electrons are more easily transferred in CB of SnS 2 due to sufficient energy to cause electron transitions in the HOMO level.The internal electric field of the interface formed by the SnS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 embedded lay structure plays an important role in it."}], "reaction medium": [{"llm generation": "Liquid", "source": "Then, as-prepared sample was magnetic stirring in the HNO 3 aqueous solution (pH 1) at 80 C for 8 h.", "context": "Tin chloride pentahydrate (SnCl 4 5H 2 O), sodium dodecyl benzenesulfonate (SDBS), L-cysteine (C 3 H 7 NO 2 ), urea, ethylene glycol (C 2 H 6 O 2 ), ethanol(C 2 H 5 OH), sulfuric acid (H 2 SO 4 ), chloroauric acid (HAuCl 4 ), nitric acid (HNO 3 ) and 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) were all purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.(Shanghai, China).Anhydrous sodium molybdate was purchased from Aladdin Reagent (Shanghai) Co., Ltd.All reagents used for preparation and direct use were of analytical grade and were not further purified.Deionized water was used in the whole experiments from local sources.

Observed obvious face-to-face SnS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 embedded layer morphology, and the uniformly distributed Au nanoparticles improved the conductivity of hybrid photocatalysts.The representative detection of SnS 2 /Au/g-C 3 N 4 during light excitation has been studied by PL spectroscopy.The energy band structure based on g-C 3 N 4 material though efficient modulation, the synthesized SnS 2 /Au/g-C 3 N 4 exhibited significant photoexcitation in photo-living oxygen; OH and O 2 -are the main active substances and the formation Z-type mechanism generates more electrons when excited by light, thereby improving the reaction efficiency.The FE-TEM clearly shows the SnS 2 /Au/g-C 3 N 4 embedded structure.This work delivers a novel tactics for the construction of the internal electric field thanks to electrostatic interaction of the interface of 2D semiconductors.Meanwhile, photocurrent, impedance, LSV curve, steady-state fluorescence and transient fluorescence results show that Au nanoparticles not only act as a bridge for electron transport in 2D semiconductor materials to accelerate electron transport, but generate more excited electrons by themselves, which effectively boosts the separation of carriers and enhances the catalyst activity.In addition, DFT calculations show that the Z-type mechanism and the intercalated energy level of the SnS 2 /Au/g-C 3 N 4 embedded structure expand the light absorption and improve the carrier separation efficiency.
