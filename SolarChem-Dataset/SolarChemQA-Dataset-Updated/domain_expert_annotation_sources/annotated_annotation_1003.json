The chemical composition of TPP/P25 was investigated by the FT-IR spectra and the results are shown in Fig. 2c-d, in which infrared spectra of pristine TPP, pristine P25 and TPP/P25 composite were compared respectively.Compared to the basic peaks of the pristine P25, the absorption peaks of TPP/P25 composite were changed obviously: the emerging peaks at 3054 cm -1 , 3024 cm -1 are corresponding to C-H stretching vibration peaks of pyrrole ring and benzene ring and peaks at 1596 cm -1 , 1473 cm -1 , 1441 cm -1 are corresponding to skeleton vibration absorption peaks of pyrrole ring and benzene ring, proving the successful attachment of TPP on the P25 21,34 .Compared to the peaks of pristine TPP, there was almost no shift of the peaks of TPP/P25, indicating the TPP was physisorped on the surface of P25 via van der Waals interactions.The actual loading amount of TPP on TPP/P25 hybrid was tested by thermogravimetric (TG) experiments.(Fig. S2).According to the TG curve, the weight loss of P25 is only 2.08 from room temperature to 1000 o C. While all the TPP/P25 hybrid products prepared with different addition of TPP show obvious weight change.The decomposition of the TPP contributes to the main weight losses as the increasing temperature.The actual the loading amount of TPP in the products of 5 TPP/P25, 10 TPP/P25, 20 TPP/P25, and 30 TPP/P25 were calculated to be 1.29, 1.82, 7.71, and 13.32, respectively.The nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms and CO 2 adsorption isotherms of the catalyst were also characterized.Fig. S3 shows the nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms of the P25 and TPP/P25.It can be seen that both the P25 and TPP/P25 show a type H3 hysteresis.After introduction of TPP, the BET surface area of TPP/P25 reached a high value of 100.7 m 2 /g, which is little higher than that of the P25 (87.2 m 2 /g).According to the CO 2 adsorption isotherms shown in Fig. S4, the TPP/P25 exhibit higher adsorption capacity than that of the P25.This higher CO 2 adsorption capacity of TPP/P25 is attributed to the basic pyrrole in the TPP, which facilitates the strong interaction with CO 2 (Lewis acid) 35 . The chemical state of P25, TPP/P25 composite and TPP were investigated by XPS spectra.The survey spectra of P25, TPP/P25 composite and TPP were shown in Fig. S5.The TPP/P25 composite is composed of Ti, O. C, and N elements, agreeing well with the STEM-EDX elemental results.Fig. 3 a-c shows the XPS spectra of Ti, O, and C elements of TPP/P25 composite.The binding energies of Ti (2p3/2) and Ti (2p3/2) peaks of the TPP/P25 composite are at 458.8 eV and464.45eV, and its binding energies of O 1s peak and C 1s peak are at 529.95 eV and 284.66 eV, respectively.Compared to the pristine P25 (Fig. 3 d-f), the binding energies of Ti 2p peaks and O 1s peak of TPP/P25 composite show slight red shift by 0.10 eV and 0.05 eV.The binding energy of C 1s peak is also increased by 0.11 eV compared with that of pristine TPP.The slight shift indicated the electronic interaction of the TPP and P25, which was helpful for electron transfer at the interface of the hybirds 212223 .The separation-recombination rate of the light-generated electron-hole pairs of TPP, TPP/P25 and P25 was investigated by PL and time-resolved PL spectroscopy (Fig. 4a).Compared to the relatively strong band peaks of P25, the fluorescence intensity of the TPP/P25 decreased obviously.The results of PL spectra suggested that the quenching by photoinduced electron transfer is effectively restrained, indicating the introduction of TPP can effectively suppress the photoinduced electron-hole recombination 36 .The timeresolved PL spectra were also characterized to evaluate the separation efficiency of photo-generated carriers.PL lifetimes analysis (Fig. 4b) shows that the average lifetime of P25 and TPP are 3.09 ns and 5.32 ns, while the lifetime of TPP/P25 composites is 6.73 ns.The longer average emission lifetime indicated that the introduction of TPP can offer more free charges to catalyze surface redox reactions.The PL quenching and lifetime increase of the TPP/P25 indicated that an electrontransfer pathway from TPP to P25 is formed 21 .The transient photocurrent spectra and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of TPP/P25, TPP and P25 were also measured to investigate the effect of the attachment of TPP, as shown in Fig. 4c-d.The transient photocurrent spectra showed that the TPP/P25 exhibited a much higher photocurrent over pristine P25 and TPP, which was caused by the good visible-light response ability and fast transfer of photogenerated carrier of TPP/P25.Furthermore, EIS test showed that TPP/P25 composite had a smaller semicircle in Nyquist plots than pristine P25 and TPP.The significantly reduced impedance of TPP/P25 contributed to the electron migration and charge separation in the photoreduction system.The above results confirmed that the introduction of TPP is highly desirable for photocatalytic CO 2 transformation to valuable products.The performance of different TPP/P25 products prepared with different addition amounts of TPP was evaluated for conversion of CO 2 in MeCN solvent under visible-light using TEOA as sacrificial electron donor.The photocatalytic experiments were conducted in a gaseous photocatalytic system.The photocatalytic reduction of the CO 2 performance of pristine P25 and TPP was first evaluated under visible light irradiation for comparison.Both the pristine P25 and TPP exhibited poor activity on the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with CO formation rate of 3.9 mol g -1 h -1 and 2.0 mol g -1 h -1 , and no CH 4 production was detected (Table 1, entry 1-2).Delightfully, all the TPP/P25 products exhibited significantly enhanced photocatalytic performance for CO 2 reduction compared with pure P25 and TPP samples,.Both the CO and CH 4 reduction products were detected from the photoreduction system after 12 h irradiation under visible light.The data presented in fig.5a reveals that the addition amount of TPP had significant impacts on the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance, following the order of 10TPP/P25 (171.9 mol g -1 h -1 of CO) 5TPP/P25 (130.4 mol g -1 h -1 of CO) 20TPP/P25 (124.1 mol g -1 h -1 of CO) 30TPP/P25 (38.7 mol g -1 h -1 of CO).The production rate of CO was much higher than CH 4 , indicating the twoelectron reduction product was easier to obtain than the eightelectron reduction product.The initial increase of the TPP leaded to the increase of the production of CO.The optimized sample is 10TPP/P25, showed the maximum production rate of CO of 171.9 mol g -1 h -1 , which is about 44 times higher than that of the pristine P25.The enhanced performance indicated the superiority of this novel composite for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.However, as the further increase of the addition amounts of the TPP, the yield of CO was gradually decreased (Fig. 5c).Excessive TPP may aggregate on the surface of the P25 and cover the active site on the surface of TiO 2 , which is not conducive to the separation and conduction of To investigate the role of the TPP/P25 sample in the photocatalytic system, some contrast experiments were conducted keeping other experimental conditions constant (Table 1, entry 8-9).When contrast tests were conducted in the absence of a catalyst or without light irradiation, no reduction products of CO 2 were detected from the reaction system.The results demonstrated that the significance of the TPP/P25 and the reaction is driven by photocatalysis.The attachment of TPP is essential for adsorbing visible light to start the reaction.When the reaction is conducted in Ar atmosphere, there were also no reaction products of CO 2 .The carbon atom origin of the products of CO and CH 4 from the photocatalytic system is confirmed by a 13 C-labled isotopic experiment.As shown in fig.5b, the peaks with m/z 17 and m/z 29 are attributed to the 13 CH 4 and 13 CO, respectively.The results proved that the carbon source of 13 CH 4 and 13 CO are generated from 13 CO 2 .When a simple mixture of TPP and P25 was used to catalyze the CO 2 reduction reaction, the production rate of CO was only 6.20 mol g -1 h -1 and no evolution of CH 4 was detected (Table 1, entry 10).The performance of the mixture is much poor than that of TPP/P25, indicating the attachment of TPP to P25 is important for obtaining enhanced photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance.The concept of total consumed electron number (TCEN) was introduced in order to conveniently compare the performance of different samples due to the existence of two kinds of products (CO and CH 4 ) of the CO 2 .TCEN(2C CO 8C CH4 )V reactor /m cat t irr , C CO and C CH4 represent the concentration of CO and CH 4 , V rea represents the volume of the reactor, m cat represents the mass of the catalyst, and t irr represents the reaction time.The results were shown in fig.5d, the 10TPP/P25 product exhibited much enhanced performance than other products with a maximum TCEN value of 394.5 mol g -1 h -1 .The 10TPP/P25 showed higher or comparable performance compared with most of the recently reported TiO 2 based photocatalysts under UV-light and visible-light irradiation, such as Pt-Cu 2 O/TiO 2 , PtRu/TiO 2 and g-C 3 N 4 /TiO 2 21, 23, 37-43 (Fig. S6).The optimized sample 10TPP/P25 was selected to verify the stability and cycling performance.No noticeable change was observed after three cycling tests, the TCEN value still maintained at more than 70 of the first cycle.The XRD or XPS characterization of the catalyst after reaction were also conducted.The XRD peaks of the TPP/P25 is almost unchanged before and after the photocatalytic

Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins Based on the above results and discussions, we proposed a possible mechanism for CO 2 photoreduction over TPP/P25 hybird (Fig. 6).First the TPP was excited under light irradiation, electrons were promoted from the ground state (HOMO orbital) to the excited state (LUMO orbital) to produce photogenerated electrons and holes.Then the light-induced electrons of the TPP transfered from the LUMO orbital of TPP to the conduction band of P25 due to the more negative LUMO of TPP.Then the photo-induced electrons from P25 reacted with the CO 2 molecules, with the CO 2 reduced to CO and CH 4 product.The conduction band of P25 (-0.55VNHE ) was higher than the reduction potential of CO 2 /CO (-0.53VNHE ) and CO 2 /CH 4 (-0.24VNHE ), which ensured the conversion of CO 2 into CO and CH 4 44 .The photoinduced holes were quenched by the sacrificial electron donor TEOA back to the fundamental state.The results were also confirmed by the Density functional theory (DFT).After the TPP inserts the occupied orbitals within the HOMO-LUMO gap of the P25, the computed HOMO-LUMO gap was decreased by 0.55 eV.The TPP/P25 hybrid has new optical excited states which are lower in energy than pristine P25 (Fig. S9).Combined with the PL and EIS results, the combination of TPP and P25 played important role for promoting the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance.The TPP serves as the light-harvesting unit to produce photogenerated electrons and holes, and the attachment of the TPP on P25 promoted the electron injection from the LUMO orbital of TPP to the CB of P25 and inhibited the recombination of light-induced electron-hole pairs, which enhanced the generation of CO and CH 4 product 45 ."}], "reactor type": [{"llm generation": "Fixed-bed", "source": "In a typical photocatalytic process, 20 mg catalyst was evenly dispersed in the solution of DMF and then uniformly dispersed on the glass fiber with a aperture of 2.7 m and a diameter of 47 mm, and the glass fiber was activated in the drying oven of 80oC for 12h.
