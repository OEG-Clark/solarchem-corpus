The morphologies of as-synthesized Bi 2 S 3 products were investigated by SEM as shown in Fig. 2.During the solvothermal synthesis of Bi 2 S 3 nanostructures, sulfur source played a crucial role in determining the morphology of the product.When S 2-was provided by TAA, Bi 2 S 3 was consisted of aggregated particles of nanometer as shown in Fig. 2a.Further observation of Fig. 2b clearly showed that these nanoparticles were a mixture of various shapes with sizes in the range of 20-100 nm.By replacing TAA with TU, a great quantity of urchin-like spherical structures of Bi 2 S 3 were observed (see Fig. 2c) and their sizes were in the range of 4-6 m.The highmagnification SEM image (Fig. 2d) clearly revealed that each the urchin-like Bi 2 S 3 microstructure was built of many Bi 2 S 3 nanorods radiating from the center with diameters of about Fig. 1 XRD patterns of the Bi 2 S 3 products: (a) nanoparticles, (b) urchin-like spheres and (c) microspheres prepared in a EG solvent system using TAA, TU and 100 nm.By using L-cysteine as sulfur source, the morphology of Bi 2 S 3 was greatly different from that of using the abovementioned organic sulfur sources.As seen in Fig. 2e, a large number of the as-prepared Bi 2 S 3 microspheres with diameters of 1-2 m bonded together.In a magnified view of Fig. 2f, one could see that all the microspheres were composed of numerous nanoplates with a thickness of about 25 nm, these nanoplates aggregated compactly together to form a hierarchical microsphere structure.The results indicated that the sulfur source was essential for the shape-controlled synthesis of Bi 2 S 3 .TAA and TU had the identical functional group of -CSNH 2 , while L-cysteine consisted of -SH, -NH 2 and -COOH functional groups, which had a strong tendency to coordinate with inorganic cations and metals.Therefore, cysteine did not only function as the sulfur source, but also as the size-and shape-controlling agent in the synthesis of the Bi 2 S 3 nanostructures.In addition, the sulfur sources influenced the S 2- concentration in the aqueous solution because of their different reactivity.The lower reactivity of TU and cysteine engendered the slower growth rate of Bi 2 S 3 , resulting in the increase of their dimensions, thereby leading to the hierarchical structure of Bi 2 S 3 . It was found that the solvent used in the synthetic system had also an important influence on the morphology of Bi 2 S 3 .As shown in Fig. 2g andh, when the same dosage of solvents including deionized water and EG were used instead of 50 ml EG and sulfur source was TU, the obtained products still appeared in urchin-like morphology composed of numerous nanorods but these nanorods became thinner and more uniform.Besides, in previous reports, rod like Bi 2 S 3 was obtained by an hydrothermal method in the case of using TAA as sulfur source. 21This was ascribed to that Bi 2 S 3 was a lamellar structure with a strong chemical bonding along the c axis direction and weak van der Waals bonding among the layered structure, which resulted in a strong tendency toward 1D growth along the 001 direction. 14Accordingly, it was indicated that the use of EG as solvent was essential for the synthesis of Bi 2 S 3 nanoparticles due to its unique physical and chemical properties.In the meantime, the 3D space structures of EG made it also function as complexion agents to form a polymer network, which might to some extent direct the assembly and formation of the Bi 2 S 3 hierarchical microsphere structure.In the present experiment, therefore, both solvent and sulfur source had crucial influence on the synthesis of Bi 2 S 3 with varied morphology. Thermal catalytic reaction is generally related to the specific surface area and the pore size distribution of the catalyst.But for the photocatalytic reaction the external area exposing to the light was an additional effect beside the conventional thermal catalytic reaction.Fig. 3 presented the nitrogen sorption isotherms and BJH pore size distribution curves (inset) of the as-prepared samples with different morphology.All the present samples displayed typical type IV isotherms with a distinct hysteresis loop observed in the range of 0.2-1.0P/P 0 , which are the characteristic feature of mesopores.The hysteresis loop in the lower-pressure range (0.4 P/P 0 0.8) was related to the intra-aggregated pores of the Bi 2 S 3 crystals, and that in the higher relative pressure range (0.8 P/P 0 1) was associated with larger inter-aggregated pores formed between secondary particles.This bimodal mesopore size distribution was further confirmed by the corresponding pore size distributions shown in the inset of Fig. 3. Bi 2 S 3 nanoparticles contained small mesopores less than 10 nm, and the other three Bi 2 S 3 hierarchical structures had a similar pore size distribution ranging from 2 to 6 nm.The above hierarchically organized porous structures might be extremely useful in photocatalysis as they would provide efficient transport pathways to the interior void space.The BET specific surface areas of Bi 2 S 3 were calculated to be 21.62 m 2 g -1 for nanoparticles, larger than that of urchin-like Bi 2 S 3 (11.88m 2 g -1 ), Bi 2 S 3 microspheres (13.20 m 2 g -1 ) and thin urchin-like Bi 2 S 3 (6.48m 2 g -1 ) due to the small particle size. The optical properties of Bi 2 S 3 samples were measured using UV-vis spectroscopy.Fig. 4 displayed the comparison of UV-visible absorption spectra of four different types of Bi 2 S 3 nanostructures.All of the nanoparticles, urchin-like spheres, microspheres and thin urchin-like spheres clearly showed strong adsorption in the UV-visible region and had a broad peak between 650 and 800 nm.The optical bandgap (E g ) of the semiconductor material could be calculated from the equation of (h) n A(h -E g ), where a, , E g , and A were the absorption coefficient, light frequency, band gap energy, and a constant, respectively.Among them, n depended on the characteristics of the transition in a semiconductor (i.e., n 2 for direct transition or n 1 for indirect transition).Here n was equal to 2 as the material is a direct-gap semiconductor. 15From the plot of (ahv) 2 vs. (hv) in inset, the E g of Bi 2 S 3 microspheres was calculated to be 1.89 eV.In addition, the estimated band gap energies of the other samples were about 1.95, 1.76 and 1.82 eV for Bi 2 S 3 nanoparticles, urchin-like and thin urchin-like Bi 2 S 3 , respectively.All the absorption for the four Bi 2 S 3 samples showed a blue shift compared with the typical direct band gap of 1.3 eV of the bulk Bi 2 S 3 crystals, which could be associated with the morphology, size and structure. The photocatalytic activity of the as-prepared Bi 2 S 3 samples was tested by reduction of CO 2 with methanol under irradiation.Fig. 5 demonstrated the MF generation results on Bi 2 S 3 samples.After reacting for 4 h, the yield of MF on Bi 2 S 3 nanoparticles was 300.94 mol g -1 , lower than that on the other three Bi 2 S 3 hierarchical structures.Although the enlargement of BET surface areas benefited the enhancement of the photocatalytic activity of catalysts, 11 a large proportion of surface areas of the Bi 2 S 3 nanoparticles might be inactive due to its unwanted agglomeration, which rendered some of the catalytic surface less accessible to light, resulting in the lowest photocatalytic activity.It was believed that a suitable conformation of pores of hierarchical structure allowed light waves to penetrate deep inside the photocatalyst and leaded to high mobility of charge. 26,27Thus, the hierarchical architectures endowed the other three samples with more surface active sites and better permeability, which was favorable for the spatial charge transfer and resulted in their superior photocatalytic performance.And Bi 2 S 3 microspheres exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity, which might be due to the multiple-reflection in the gaps of packing nanoplates and more surface active sites.In addition, the reaction of MF formation over Bi 2 S 3 microspheres was repeated for three times, as shown in Fig. 6.The results indicated that Bi 2 S 3 microspheres photocatalysts were stable under the present experimental conditions. For comparison, experiments under illumination without catalysts and in the dark with catalysts were carried out, and no MF could be detected, demonstrating that MF was produced via photocatalysis.Furthermore, the photocatalytic formation of MF under nitrogen atmospheres was also shown in Fig. 5. Methanol was dehydrogenated to CH 2 OH and HCHO in the VB and the produced H was reduced to H 2 in the CB in the absence of CO 2 .Furthermore methyl formate was formed Dalton Transactions through dimerization of formaldehyde.Although MF formed even without CO 2 , the amount of MF produced for 4 h irradiation was less than one third of that under a CO 2 atmosphere, which indicated that the formation of MF was mainly the result of the photoreduction of CO 2 .To confirm this, online ATR-FTIR spectroscopy was applied to monitor the CO 2 content of the reaction solution.A CO 2 peak at 2343 cm -1 was observed apparently when methanol was saturated with CO 2 .A plot of peak height at 2343 cm -1 versus reaction time was shown in Fig. 7.Under illumination, the peak height decreased obviously, but it remained almost stable when in the dark, indicating that CO 2 was consumed in the photoreaction.It is, therefore, noteworthy that CO 2 was indeed reduced in the reaction.Since the experimental conditions and specific products vary dramatically, it is difficult to compare the photocatalytic activity of Bi 2 S 3 with the activities reported for other oxides.Nonetheless, the photocatalytic activity of Bi 2 S 3 may be higher than that of TiO 2 -RMA (CH 4 , 18.9 mol g -1 ) after 8 h of continuous irradiation, 28 Zn 2 GeO 4 -Cl (CH 4 : 2.8 mol h -1 g -1 ) 29 and rectangular sheet-like WO 3 (CH 4 : 0.34 mol h -1 g -1 ). 5 Normally, the photoreduction of CO 2 is greatly influenced by the reaction parameters, catalyst preparation and solvent used.In this work, CH 3 OH was used as a solvent and reductant because of its strong reducibility and the high solubility of CO 2 .A recent study has demonstrated that CO 2 was almost the entire carbon source for the photocatalytically produced formic acid, and formaldehyde was produced from methanol acting as a reducing agent during the photocatalytic reaction. 30ccording to additional isotopic labeling studies reported in the previous work, the bulk of MF was produced via CO 2 reduction rather than methanol oxidation. 31That work showed that the formyl group of methyl formate was produced via reduction of CO 2 to formic acid, which then reacted with methanol to produce the ester.In the present work, the position of the conduction and valence bands in as-prepared Bi 2 S 3 microspheres was determined by the following equation: E VB X -E c -0.5E g , where E c is the energy of the free electrons on the hydrogen scale (4.5 eV), X is the electronegativity of the semiconductor, and E g is the band-gap energy of the semiconductor.The edge of the valence band E VB of the Bi 2 S 3 microspheres was determined to be 1.72 V versus NHE, which was more positive than E o (CH 3 OH/ CH 2 OH) (0.927 V). 32,33 And the conduction band E CB was estimated to be -0.17V versus NHE.Bi 2 S 3 microspheres with narrow band gap energy (1.89 eV) could be easily excited by UV light (365 nm, 3.4 eV) and induced the generation of photoelectrons and holes.Meanwhile, electrons in the VB of Bi 2 S 3 could also be excited up to a higher potential edge (-1.68 V) due to the higher photon energy, 34 which was more negative than E o (CO 2 /HCOOH) (-0.61 V). 35 This indicated that the photogenerated electrons and holes on the irradiated Bi 2 S 3 could react with CO 2 and methanol to produce formic acid and formaldehyde, as shown in Fig. 8. Methyl formate could be produced through the esterification of formic acid and methanol and dimerization of formaldehyde via Tishchenko reaction. 36g. 6 Time course of MF formation over Bi 2 S 3 microspheres, the photocatalyst was recovered every four hours."}], "lamp": [{"llm generation": "Mercury", "source": "The reactor was illuminated by a 250 W high-pressure mercury lamp with the radiation peak at about 365 nm.", "context": "All of the chemicals such as ethylene glycol (EG), bismuth nitrate (Bi(NO 3 ) 3 5H 2 O), thioacetamide (TAA), thiourea (TU), and L-cysteine were of analytical grade and used without further purification.
