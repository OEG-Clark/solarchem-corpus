Then reactive species further react with catalysts and product fuels are finally formed.The stronger CO 2 chemisorption on catalyst is, more reactive species are generated on the surface of catalysts, which usually means better photocatalytic activity of reduction CO 2 .The chemisorption ability of CO 2 on Ni doped In 2 O 3 was evaluated by programmed temperature desorption of CO 2 .As shown in Fig.9, all samples showed a significant desorption peak at 95 C, while Ni doped samples showed much broader desorption peak and higher desorption temperature.All CO 2 adsorbed on the surface of bare In 2 O 3 desorbed at the temperature of below 120 C due to the weak interaction between CO 2 and In 2 O 3 .Those adsorbed on Ni doped samples still attached on the surface at higher than 200 C.Moreover, the desorption peak area was also increased gradually with the increase of doping amount, suggesting the incorporation of Ni has a strong promotion effect on the amount of chemisorbed CO 2 .In 2 O 3 is an amphoteric metal oxide while only weak basic sites exist on the surface.After the doping of Ni, the chemisorption amount and strength of CO 2 increased gradually.It may be attributed to two possible reasons: the increase of the weak basicity due to Ni doping, and especially the new active sites generated from the lattice defects by the replacement of In 3 with Ni 2 .

SEM and TEM/HRTEM were employed to investigate the morphologies and crystal structures of Ni doped In 2 O 3 samples, which were shown in Fig. 2. According to the SEM images in Fig. 2 (Fig. 2a,d,g), the undoped In 2 O 3 , 1Ni-In 2 O 3 and 2Ni-In 2 O 3 all presented the morphologies of cube like with different size.The TEM images in Fig. 2(b,e,h) confirmed that these cubes were formed by the stack of porous nanosheets.It can be seen clearly from both SEM images and TEM images in Fig. 2 that nanosheet size decreased gradually with the increase of Ni doping amount.HRTEM images (Fig. 2c,f,i) showed that all samples displayed the lattice fringes with interplanar spacings of 0.292 nm, which is corresponding to (222) crystal plane of cubic In 2 O 3 .These results were consistent with the result of XRD.No Lattice stripe of any Ni compounds were found, indicating that Ni mainly existed in the lattice of In 2 O 3 by replacing In 3 .To further investigate the element distribution, EDX elemental mapping technique was applied on 1Ni-In 2 O 3 as seen in Fig. 3. It's obvious that Ni, In and O elements are evenly distributed in the whole test sample area and the content of the elements are basically consistent with the feed ratio in the composite. To further study the pore structures and size distribution of Niloading samples, N 2 adsorption-desorption experiments were carried out.The N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherm and BJH pore size distribution are shown in Fig. 4, all samples displayed type IV adsorption curves with hysteresis loops, the area of the hysteresis loop increased gradually with the increae of Ni doping amount, indicating the increase of mesopore number and surface area.As can be seen in Fig. 4B, all samples show a peak in the mesopore distribution range, the peak area also increased with the increase of Ni doping amount, indicating the increase of mesopore number.The specific datum for BET specifc surface areas, average diameters, and pore volumes of Ni doped In 2 O 3 samples are listed in Table The results of N 2 adsorption and desorption experiment. The optical and electronic properties of catalysts significantly influence photocatalytic activity of sample, which were studied by photoluminescence emission spectra, UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectrum and electrochemical analysis, respectively, in this work.The recombination rate of photoexcited electron-hole pairs can be analyzed by photoluminescence emission spectra as shown in Fig. 5.All samples established a broad and strong peak at the range of 500-750 nm, which means that the introduction of transition metal ions did not induce rise to a new luminescence phenomenon.However, the intensity of doped In 2 O 3 samples decreased gradually with the increase of doping amount while all doped samples showed much lower intensity compared to undoped In 2 O 3 .Doping of transition metal ions could efficiently suppress the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs.Compared to the results of XRD and SEMTEM, the lower recombination rate of photogenerated electron-hole pairs might be attributed to the doping of divalent transition metal ions by replacing trivalent In 3 in In 2 O 3 lattice. To further study the influence of transition metal doping on the optical and electronic properties, UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra was performed as shown in Fig. 6.As can be seen in Fig. 6A, the light absorbances of all doped samples are greatly enhanced in the visible light region compared with undoped In 2 O 3 .1Ni-In 2 O 3 sample exhibited the strongest visible light response among all samples.The changes of visible light absorbance may attribute to many reasons such as crystal size, band structure and defects in structure.To determine the influence of band gap structure on light absorbance, the band gap value of transition metal doped In 2 O 3 was calculated by transformed Kubelka-Munk function as follows 41. Where is the absorption coefficient of material, h is the energy of light, E g is the band gap energy of semiconductor, the value of the exponent n denotes the nature of the transition (n 1/2 for direct allowed transitions and n 2 for indirect allowed transitions).The calculation results in Fig. 6B showed that the band gaps for In 2 O 3 , 0.5 Ni-In 2 O 3 , 1Ni -In 2 O 3 , 2Ni-In 2 O 3 and 3Ni-In 2 O 3 were estimated to be 2.90, 2.88, 2.83, 2.81 and 2.80 eV, respectively.It is apparent that the band gap value decreased gradually with the increase of doping amount, which means the doped transition metal ions entered the lattice of In 2 O 3 , leading to the decrease of band gap value. Mott-Schottky plots (M-S) were employed to evaluate the flat-band potential (E FB ), carrier concentration and the type of semiconductors by measuring 1/C 2 vs. potential at a fixed frequency of 1 kHz.The flat-band potential(E FB ) at electrode-electrolyte interface was estimated by following equation 42. where C is the specific capacity, r is the dielectric constant of the samples, 0 is the electric permittivity of vacuum (8.85 10 -12 N -1 C 2 m -2 ), e is the electronic charge, N d is the carrier density of the samples, A is the efficient area of the electrode, E is the applied potential, Normally, the conductive band (CB) edge positions are about 0.1 0.2 eV more negative than corresponding flat band voltages 44, and the valence band (VB) positions can be calculated by the theoretical equation: E VB E CB E g .Therefore, the band gaps, the conductive band and the valence band edge positions of all samples can be calculated and listed in Table 2. To further verify the optical responding properties and study the photoelectric properties, a series of photoelectrochemical tests were carried out by an electrochemical workstation.The transient photocurrent responses under Xe lamp irradiation were recorded and the light on-off cycle was 30 s.The init electromotive force is 0.5 V.As can be seen in Fig. 8A, all doped samples showed higher photocurrent than undoped In 2 O 3 , and photocurrent firstly increased gradually, then decreased with the increase of Ni doping amount, and 1Ni-In 2 O 3 displayed the highest photocurrent.The decline of photocurrent with further increase of Ni doping amount might be due to the decrease of photoabsorption capability to visible light.The above results are consistent with the result of UV-vis spectrum. CV curves were measured to study the ability of charge transmission.The electromotive force interval is between -0.561.22V with scan rate of 0.1 V/s.The numerical values of CV curves are determined by the number of electrons entering or leaving the electrode, which means the curve integral area is positively correlated with electronic transmission capacity.According to Fig. 8B, 1Ni-In 2 O 3 showed the highest CV curve area, which is consistent to results of transient photocurrent responses. Since the chemisorption performance of CO 2 on the catalyst is directly related to the reactivity.During CO 2 reduction process, CO 2 molecules and photocatalysts are interacted to create reactive species such as m-CO 3 The photocatalytic activities of Ni modified In 2 O 3 were evaluated by The band gap, the position of conduction band and valence band.10B, the production rates of CO and CH 4 are almost unchanged and stay over 95 , but production rate of H 2 dropped rapidly in the second cycle and stayed steady in the third cycle.This may be attributed to the presence of some unstable oxygen defect sites on the surface of the fresh samples, which played the role of the sacrificial agent in producing hydrogen.After one cycle of reaction, these unstable defect sites were lost and the activity remained stable.A long-time reaction was carried out to further study the stability as can be seen in Fig. 10C, the production rate for CO and CH 4 kept steady within 10 h, and the production rate H 2 decreased slightly with time.The promoted activity of Ni doped In 2 O 3 for photoreduction of CO 2 into fuels could be attributed to several factors.Firstly, the replacement of partial In 3 in In 2 O 3 lattice by Ni 2 led to the decrease of lattice constant due to the smaller radius of Ni 2 than In 3 , which may result into higher specific surface area and stronger adsorption ability.Secondly, the lower oxidation state of doped Ni 2 compared to In 3 would induce the generation of oxygen vacancies and the formation of defects.Such defects would act as electron trap, enhancing the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs.Thirdly, increased basicity due to Ni doping and formation of additional active species over defects promoted CO 2 chemisorption on both strength and amount.Finally, band structure was adjusted with Ni doping, which enhanced the absorption of visible light and the generation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs.However, doping amount of Ni played important role in optimizing and regulating energy band structure, while excessive doping may lead to improper band structure which restrained the activity for CO 2 reduction.Furthermore, Excessive doping of Ni 2 will not enter into lattice but form nickel oxide, leading to the decrease of defect number, thus reducing light absorbance ability. To clarify the process of photocatalytic reduction CO 2 into fuels, a possible mechanism was proposed taking 1Ni-In 2 O 3 as example, which is shown in scheme 2 .Band gap of In 2 O 3 is adjusted to 2.83 eV due to Ni doping, which is able to absorb visible light irradiation in a broader range.The valance band is more positive than oxidation potential of H 2 O while the conduction band locates more negatively than all reduction potential of CO 2 , which facilitates the catalytic reaction.Electrons in valance band are excited to the conduction band and react with surface adsorbed CO 2 into active species and finally into renewable fuels such as CH 4 , CO and H 2 .Meanwhile holes at valance band oxidized water vapor as sacrificial agent to form oxygen and hydrogen radical."}], "lamp": [{"llm generation": "Xenon", "source": "PL spectra were measured on a Fluorolog 3 photoluminescence spectrometer (HORIBA Jobin Yvon, USA) using a Xe lamp with an excitation wavelength of 325 nm at room temperature.", "context": "Ni doped In 2 O 3 was synthesized by a simple ammonia precipitation method.All chemical reagents were of analysis grade and used without further purification.InCl 3 and Ni(NO 3 ) 2 were used as indium source and nickel source, respectively.Deionized water was used throughout the experiment.In a typical synthesis process, 0.3 g polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) was added into 30 mL deionized water and stirred for 15 min, then 3 mmol InCl 3 and a certain amount of Ni(NO 3 ) 2 were added into the solution and stirred for another 30 min to form a transparent and homogeneous solution.Ammonia solution was slowly added into the solution by drop until the pH reached 9, and then the mixed solution was transferred to a water bath with stirring at 60 C for 4 h.The obtained precipitate was washed with deionized water for three times and dried at 50 C overnight, then calcined at 500 C for 4 h in a muffle furnace.The obtained product was ground into powder.By changing the adding amount of Ni(NO 3 ) 2 , four samples with Ni mass ratios of 0.5, 1, 2 and 3, respectively were prepared, which was denoted as xNi-In 2 O 3 (x represents the mass ratio of Ni element in the sample throughout the paper).Bare In 2 O 3 was also synthesized by the same method without the addition of Ni(NO 3 ) 2 .

In this work, Ni doped In 2 O 3 was synthesized by a facile precipitation method.A series of characterizations were conducted to study the influence of Ni doping amount on morphology, optical and electronic properties of porous In 2 O 3 nanosheets.Ni doping obviously decreases the particle sizes, narrows the band gap of In 2 O 3 , and improves the light absorption in visible region.Moreover, incorporation of Ni in In 2 O 3 strengthens the chemical interaction between CO 2 and semiconductors as well as significantly increases the adsorption amount of CO 2 species.Consequently, Ni doped In 2 O 3 samples exhibit much higher production rate of H 2 , CO, and CH 4 comparing to bare one, while 1Ni-In 2 O 3 shows the highest photocatalytic activity among all samples, with H 2 , CO, and CH 4 formation rates of 27.8, 20.8, and 66.2 molg -1 cat h -1 , about 4.9, 2.7, and 3.1 times higher than undoped In 2 O 3 , respectively.

Mott-Schottky plots of Ni doped In 2 O 3 at frequency 1.0 kHz. . Then reactive species further react with catalysts and product fuels are finally formed.The stronger CO 2 chemisorption on catalyst is, more reactive species are generated on the surface of catalysts, which usually means better photocatalytic activity of reduction CO 2 .The chemisorption ability of CO 2 on Ni doped In 2 O 3 was evaluated by programmed temperature desorption of CO 2 .As shown in Fig.9, all samples showed a significant desorption peak at 95 C, while Ni doped samples showed much broader desorption peak and higher desorption temperature.All CO 2 adsorbed on the surface of bare In 2 O 3 desorbed at the temperature of below 120 C due to the weak interaction between CO 2 and In 2 O 3 .Those adsorbed on Ni doped samples still attached on the surface at higher than 200 C.Moreover, the desorption peak area was also increased gradually with the increase of doping amount, suggesting the incorporation of Ni has a strong promotion effect on the amount of chemisorbed CO 2 .In 2 O 3 is an amphoteric metal oxide while only weak basic sites exist on the surface.After the doping of Ni, the chemisorption amount and strength of CO 2 increased gradually.It may be attributed to two possible reasons: the increase of the weak basicity due to Ni doping, and especially the new active sites generated from the lattice defects by the replacement of In 3 with Ni 2 .

SEM and TEM/HRTEM were employed to investigate the morphologies and crystal structures of Ni doped In 2 O 3 samples, which were shown in Fig. 2. According to the SEM images in Fig. 2 (Fig. 2a,d,g), the undoped In 2 O 3 , 1Ni-In 2 O 3 and 2Ni-In 2 O 3 all presented the morphologies of cube like with different size.The TEM images in Fig. 2(b,e,h) confirmed that these cubes were formed by the stack of porous nanosheets.It can be seen clearly from both SEM images and TEM images in Fig. 2 that nanosheet size decreased gradually with the increase of Ni doping amount.HRTEM images (Fig. 2c,f,i) showed that all samples displayed the lattice fringes with interplanar spacings of 0.292 nm, which is corresponding to (222) crystal plane of cubic In 2 O 3 .These results were consistent with the result of XRD.No Lattice stripe of any Ni compounds were found, indicating that Ni mainly existed in the lattice of In 2 O 3 by replacing In 3 .To further investigate the element distribution, EDX elemental mapping technique was applied on 1Ni-In 2 O 3 as seen in Fig. 3. It's obvious that Ni, In and O elements are evenly distributed in the whole test sample area and the content of the elements are basically consistent with the feed ratio in the composite. To further study the pore structures and size distribution of Niloading samples, N 2 adsorption-desorption experiments were carried out.The N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherm and BJH pore size distribution are shown in Fig. 4, all samples displayed type IV adsorption curves with hysteresis loops, the area of the hysteresis loop increased gradually with the increae of Ni doping amount, indicating the increase of mesopore number and surface area.As can be seen in Fig. 4B, all samples show a peak in the mesopore distribution range, the peak area also increased with the increase of Ni doping amount, indicating the increase of mesopore number.The specific datum for BET specifc surface areas, average diameters, and pore volumes of Ni doped In 2 O 3 samples are listed in Table The results of N 2 adsorption and desorption experiment. The optical and electronic properties of catalysts significantly influence photocatalytic activity of sample, which were studied by photoluminescence emission spectra, UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectrum and electrochemical analysis, respectively, in this work.The recombination rate of photoexcited electron-hole pairs can be analyzed by photoluminescence emission spectra as shown in Fig. 5.All samples established a broad and strong peak at the range of 500-750 nm, which means that the introduction of transition metal ions did not induce rise to a new luminescence phenomenon.However, the intensity of doped In 2 O 3 samples decreased gradually with the increase of doping amount while all doped samples showed much lower intensity compared to undoped In 2 O 3 .Doping of transition metal ions could efficiently suppress the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs.Compared to the results of XRD and SEMTEM, the lower recombination rate of photogenerated electron-hole pairs might be attributed to the doping of divalent transition metal ions by replacing trivalent In 3 in In 2 O 3 lattice. To further study the influence of transition metal doping on the optical and electronic properties, UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra was performed as shown in Fig. 6.As can be seen in Fig. 6A, the light absorbances of all doped samples are greatly enhanced in the visible light region compared with undoped In 2 O 3 .1Ni-In 2 O 3 sample exhibited the strongest visible light response among all samples.The changes of visible light absorbance may attribute to many reasons such as crystal size, band structure and defects in structure.To determine the influence of band gap structure on light absorbance, the band gap value of transition metal doped In 2 O 3 was calculated by transformed Kubelka-Munk function as follows 41. Where is the absorption coefficient of material, h is the energy of light, E g is the band gap energy of semiconductor, the value of the exponent n denotes the nature of the transition (n 1/2 for direct allowed transitions and n 2 for indirect allowed transitions).The calculation results in Fig. 6B showed that the band gaps for In 2 O 3 , 0.5 Ni-In 2 O 3 , 1Ni -In 2 O 3 , 2Ni-In 2 O 3 and 3Ni-In 2 O 3 were estimated to be 2.90, 2.88, 2.83, 2.81 and 2.80 eV, respectively.It is apparent that the band gap value decreased gradually with the increase of doping amount, which means the doped transition metal ions entered the lattice of In 2 O 3 , leading to the decrease of band gap value. Mott-Schottky plots (M-S) were employed to evaluate the flat-band potential (E FB ), carrier concentration and the type of semiconductors by measuring 1/C 2 vs. potential at a fixed frequency of 1 kHz.The flat-band potential(E FB ) at electrode-electrolyte interface was estimated by following equation 42. where C is the specific capacity, r is the dielectric constant of the samples, 0 is the electric permittivity of vacuum (8.85 10 -12 N -1 C 2 m -2 ), e is the electronic charge, N d is the carrier density of the samples, A is the efficient area of the electrode, E is the applied potential, Normally, the conductive band (CB) edge positions are about 0.1 0.2 eV more negative than corresponding flat band voltages 44, and the valence band (VB) positions can be calculated by the theoretical equation: E VB E CB E g .Therefore, the band gaps, the conductive band and the valence band edge positions of all samples can be calculated and listed in Table 2. To further verify the optical responding properties and study the photoelectric properties, a series of photoelectrochemical tests were carried out by an electrochemical workstation.The transient photocurrent responses under Xe lamp irradiation were recorded and the light on-off cycle was 30 s.The init electromotive force is 0.5 V.As can be seen in Fig. 8A, all doped samples showed higher photocurrent than undoped In 2 O 3 , and photocurrent firstly increased gradually, then decreased with the increase of Ni doping amount, and 1Ni-In 2 O 3 displayed the highest photocurrent.The decline of photocurrent with further increase of Ni doping amount might be due to the decrease of photoabsorption capability to visible light.The above results are consistent with the result of UV-vis spectrum. CV curves were measured to study the ability of charge transmission.The electromotive force interval is between -0.561.22V with scan rate of 0.1 V/s.The numerical values of CV curves are determined by the number of electrons entering or leaving the electrode, which means the curve integral area is positively correlated with electronic transmission capacity.According to Fig. 8B, 1Ni-In 2 O 3 showed the highest CV curve area, which is consistent to results of transient photocurrent responses. Since the chemisorption performance of CO 2 on the catalyst is directly related to the reactivity.During CO 2 reduction process, CO 2 molecules and photocatalysts are interacted to create reactive species such as m-CO 3 The photocatalytic activities of Ni modified In 2 O 3 were evaluated by The band gap, the position of conduction band and valence band.10B, the production rates of CO and CH 4 are almost unchanged and stay over 95 , but production rate of H 2 dropped rapidly in the second cycle and stayed steady in the third cycle.This may be attributed to the presence of some unstable oxygen defect sites on the surface of the fresh samples, which played the role of the sacrificial agent in producing hydrogen.After one cycle of reaction, these unstable defect sites were lost and the activity remained stable.A long-time reaction was carried out to further study the stability as can be seen in Fig. 10C, the production rate for CO and CH 4 kept steady within 10 h, and the production rate H 2 decreased slightly with time.The promoted activity of Ni doped In 2 O 3 for photoreduction of CO 2 into fuels could be attributed to several factors.Firstly, the replacement of partial In 3 in In 2 O 3 lattice by Ni 2 led to the decrease of lattice constant due to the smaller radius of Ni 2 than In 3 , which may result into higher specific surface area and stronger adsorption ability.Secondly, the lower oxidation state of doped Ni 2 compared to In 3 would induce the generation of oxygen vacancies and the formation of defects.Such defects would act as electron trap, enhancing the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs.Thirdly, increased basicity due to Ni doping and formation of additional active species over defects promoted CO 2 chemisorption on both strength and amount.Finally, band structure was adjusted with Ni doping, which enhanced the absorption of visible light and the generation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs.However, doping amount of Ni played important role in optimizing and regulating energy band structure, while excessive doping may lead to improper band structure which restrained the activity for CO 2 reduction.Furthermore, Excessive doping of Ni 2 will not enter into lattice but form nickel oxide, leading to the decrease of defect number, thus reducing light absorbance ability.
