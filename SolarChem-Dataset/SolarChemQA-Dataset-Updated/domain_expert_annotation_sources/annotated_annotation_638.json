Top: MoS 2 nanoflower illustration depicting the flake edges that are comprised of stacked sheets that contain rich edge sites on both the flake edges and flake surfaces.Middle: SEM micrographs showing the MoS 2 particle morphology at 2,500X and 10,000X for SZF and TZF nanoflowers.Also displayed is the SZF substrate growth and the TZF average cell volume and lattice parameter calculations. The EDS mapping confirmed an even distribution of S and Mo in the bulk powder (Fig. 4 A-C), while elemental analysis confirmed the average Mo:S atomic ratio reduction as ramp rate increased (Fig. S5).Trace Cl was identified with EDS at inconsistent locations throughout the bulk powders of the TZF and high ramp rates of SZF synthesized powders, but was not a significant presence classified in the underdeveloped nanosheets.Higher ramp rates enabled rapid layer formation and precursor material (MoCl 5 ) to linger, reducing the overall MoS 2 nanosheet density, and had an increased presence of underdeveloped amorphous MoS 2 clusters that developed on and around the nanosheets.Thicker flakes at high ramp rates were in the diffusion controlled region, which facilitated homogeneous nucleation, causing crystal structure deformations.Slower ramp rates (5 C/min) encouraged heterogeneous nucleation and thinner sheet stack formations via controlled epitaxy from the thermal stability 45 .A thermodynamic evaluation of Mo-S-Cl-H-Ar system revealed that a high Ar dilution supports a nearly complete reduction of MoCl x in the presence of S. Literature also supports 700 C as a good CVD processing temperature for pure production of MoS 2 46 .The downstream carrier gas aided in a high yield deposit of stacked MoS 2 flakes on Si substrates (Fig. 3).Consistent flake thicknesses of 100 nm were achieved for MoS 2 growth on the substrates, but were not further investigated in this paper.TEM images (Fig. 4 D-F), displayed the morphology of a single sheet layer confirming the hexagonal MoS 2 structure with lattice parameters a 3.2 A and c 12.3 A for SZF-5 material.The HRTEM showed atoms clearly resolved in (110), (010), and (100) planes, and the d-spacing of 0.27 nm.The H 2 treatment did not change the overall diameter or nature of the nanoflower shape, but rather the intrinsic structural defects and sheet thickness.Additional SZF TEM images are found in Fig. S8.Atomic point vacancies of the TZF-5 powders that were post-treated in 1 H 2 /Ar at 480 C were are displayed in Fig. S9, and TEM images indicating some of the atomic vacancies of the TZF-5 powder is displayed in Fig. S10.The basal plane of 2D MoS 2 is classified as chemically inert because the O atom is not available to obtain more e-to dissociate reactants (i.e.H 2 O) for further catalysis, however a basal plane with defects can provide some additional catalytic activity 47 . TEM was in agreement with XRD results (Fig. 5).The 2H-MoS 2 phase was dominant in the CVD nanoflowers and Sigma-Aldrich MoS 2 powder.The 2H phase is the most stable with two layers per unit cell stack repeat, and has the strongest mechanical and semiconducting properties 48 .The diffraction lines positioned at 14.3 , 32.7, 33.6, 58.4, and 60.5 were assigned to planes (002), (100), (101), (110), and (112) respectively of the 2H-MoS 2 phase.Sharp peaks at slower ramp rates (5 C/min) verified more repeating TMD unit-cells, enhancing the finely stacked MoS 2 layers.The strong (002) peak correlated to the stacked structures oriented along the c-axis.As ramp rates increased, impurities were introduced and disrupted the crystal formation with amorphous introductions, confirmed by the broader peak formation.The asymmetry along the (100) peak was due to disordered laminar structures which was more prevalent in higher ramp rates and observed in the TEM data.Peaks positioned at 14.5(003) and 38.3 and 41 (104) were assigned to the unstable 3R-MoS 2 phase, which has 3 layers per unit stack repeat, in the rhombohedral symmetry with trigonal prismatic coordination 11 .The 3R phase was not present in the Sigma-Aldrich powder, but present in all CVD powders.In the 1H 2 /Ar samples, 2H was dominant with a 3R presence, and the line positioned at 26.3 was believed to either be associated with a Mo-oxide state, which was also in agreement with the follow on XPS analysis.3) unveiled smaller lattice parameters than the reference 2H values.Smaller unit cell was due to the thermodynamic control in the tube furnace during the slower ramp rate of 2 C/min (TZF-2), with stability and finer nucleation during vapor deposition.The increased ramp rates of 5 and 10 C/min had larger lattice parameter and cell volumes, aiding in structural strain as it stretches towards the unstable 3R phase.The H 2 treated samples had fluctuations in a and c as stress and strain was introduced during treatment, but maintained stable cell volume.These stress and strain observations in the crystal structure are important to note for the observed catalytic results discussed later in this paper. The XPS measurements (Fig. 6) confirmed the MoS 2 purity by the Mo 3d3/2, Mo 3d5/2, and overlap of S 2S peak regions at 232.5, 229.5, and 226.5 eV, respectively.The Mo 3d5/2 peak position at 229.6 eV is the ideal MoS 2 location, and a shift to higher binding energy indicated the presence of MoCl x , which are not very strong on the surface here, while lower binding energy shifts indicated the presence of impurities towards lower Mo-oxide states towards elemental Mo, accounting for the reduced powders treated in H 2 .Clear splitting of the spin orbit doublet in the S 2p region was present at slower ramp rates and became an overlapping spin-orbit doublet at higher ramp rates and 1 H 2 /Ar samples.This S shift at lower binding energy attributed to impurities effecting the S loss at the 10 and 20 C/min ramp rates and the longer H 2 treatments.The XPS depth profiling (Fig. S6) performed on the Si substrate of MoS 2 SZF-5 verified underlayer purity of the MoS 2 formation, showing promise for pure product formation on substrates.The calculated Eg values are shown in Fig. 7 and ranged from 1.38 to 1.82 eV (/-0.04eV).The Eg was independently controllable as a function of ramp rate and of post-treatment in 1 H 2 /Ar.Since the cb position of bulk MoS 2 is slightly more positive than that for HER, a negative bias or quantum confinement effect, such as those found through impurities or increased edge site exposure, can help overcome the negative bias and confinement effects 49 .Higher ramp rate increased the nanosheet thickness and nanoflower diameter, and decreased the Eg, which may seem counterintuitive to the quantum confinement effects for nanoparticles, but the contamination or impurities from unresolved nanosheet formation or precursor material may have contributed to this Eg shift, which resulted with absorption to longer wavelengths.In this case, instead of decreasing the number of layers to transform the MoS 2 from an indirect to direct-band-gap semiconductors, we are increasing the amount of active edge sites with disruption of the sulfurization process to interfere with stacking geometry and create more multifunctional edge-site through impurities of MoCl x and H 2 (to draw out Sulfur) in the structure to contribute to the lower Eg values.Lattice structure can also influence light absorption 4 , without changing the optical Eg, not actually aiding in the parent photocatalytic Eg reduction, but only surface effects, which we see in the 3R and lattice parameter defects. The CO evolutions from photoreactor experiments are displayed in Fig. 8 A andB.A volcano-type plot was generated in Fig. 8A for samples reacted at 100 C, demonstrating that the SZF and TZF flake thickness is important for improved catalytic activity.The slowest ramp rate, 2 C/min (TZF-2), had one of the lowest CO productions rates.TZF-2 was tuned as a stable composition with the thinnest edge-site stacks (smallest flake thickness) and higher Eg than TZF-5 and TZF-10 samples.The TZF-2 stack also had the purest nanoflower, which a large area of basal plane purity.As described earlier, the basal plane surface is catalytically inert, and with smooth flake surfaces, less edge sites are available for reactions, so this result was not surprising for TZF-2.Increasing the ramp rate for increased distortions on the crystal planes also facilitated increased catalytic activity.The opposite scenario of too much surface contamination and lower nanoflower abundance (less edge sites), at the highest ramp rate (SZF-20, 20 C/min), also increased Eg, along with increasing the crystal structure deformity.This scenario hindered light adsorption, encouraging recombination and lowering photocatalytic activity.The 'sweet spot' of higher catalytic activity was found in those with plentiful thick edge-site abundance and defect laden crystal structures at 5 and 10 C/min (SZF-5, TZF-5, SZF-10, TZF-10).The ample edge-sites with dangling bonds both at the flake edges and on the surface of the MoS 2 flake, along with the slight crystal impurities, worked in combination to lower the Eg and achieve materials that reduced recombination and enabled faster charge transport for photocatalytic reactions.This demonstration has been observed on vertically grown MoS 2 flakes to also maximize active edge sites and increase HER performance 50 .In summary of this initial photoreaction observation, the declined activity at the highest and lowest ramp rates was ascribed to the interlayer interactions.If nanoflowers were not abundant for gas phase reactions at the edge sites, the Eg widened.Slowing the ramp rate provided thinner layers and less impurity but also having a large Eg with band misalignment and not enough charge transport support from thicker edge sites and impurities to increase the catalytic activity.Thicker and abundant edge sites and strain defects with minimal impurities (non 2D formations) are imperative for increased photocatalytic activity, but a balance of these surface chemistries and defects need to be maintained, as displayed through controlled flake thickness.SZF-5 had smaller nanoflower diameters, which also enabled higher surface area and edge site exposure than the larger TZF-5, SZF-10 and TZF-10 samples.MoS 2 CVD synthesis with MoCl 5 precursor are ideal to use with S as it is possible to have a one-step reaction to form a uniform MoS 2 monolayer when the S is provided in excess.In our case, we have found increasing the ramp rate decreased the nanoflower monolayer abundance (as observed by decrease in nanoflowers and increase in amorphous bulk with trace Cl findings).So not only did the S vacancy formation and residual halide add to the decreased band gap, is also removed active edge sites through abundant sheet formations, therefore lowering the overall catalytic activity in the bulk photoreactor experiments.Negligible CO production (0.01 mol-g cat -1 hr -1 ) was observed in most samples at 25 C, and was not plotted in Fig. 8 A. Some of the mechanistic pathways required for CO 2 reduction are displayed in Fig. 9.The HER and CO 2 reduction reactions are dependent on many activities synchronizing correctly, including the formation of the OH radical, crystal phase of the catalyst, and delay of the recombination of the photogenerated e -/h pair 51 .It is generally known that CO 2 photocatalytic conversion to CH 4 at high selectivity requires 8 e -/h whereas CO is achievable in the presence of H 2 O at a 2 e -/h process.In this reaction, H 2 O was the limiting reagent and so higher hydrocarbon formation was challenging.The light energy enabled creation of free e -/h photo-generated states on the MoS 2 , which enabled H 2 adsorption to assist in reduction of CO 2 .The charge separation is one of the most important factors that determine how efficiently a photocatalytic system will operate.The sooner e -and h arrive at their \"destination\" after being generated by photons, the less likely they will recombine.From DFT theory and prior literature, high H 2 binding energy is most actively located on the Mo-edges (where S is lacking). 36The edge sites primarily with defects, allow metallic edge states that support shifts in valence band and oxidation potentials, having increased activity when compared to the bulk structure.It is also recalled from DFT calculations that only 1 in 4 edge atoms will evolve molecular H 2 at a given time on the active MoS 2 edge site 48 .Attempts to stimulate activity from the MoS 2 material have gained so much attention for the isolated molecule because it is often compared to Pt, a high performing photocatalyst.Efforts continue in tuning the electronic edge structure and adding defects to activate the basal plane to stimulate activity of the MoS 2 material.In our work, the MoS 2 treated with H 2 yielded the highest CO production.This correlated with XPS results.The reduction in the oxidation state for the Mo d band electronic structure was observed in the 30 min.H 2 post treatment sample (TZF-5-30H 2 ), and therefore influencing the absorbate.Slower ramp rates without H 2 treatment also have some of the highest d band filling, while increasing the ramp rate reduces its nominal oxidation state.H 2 was likely favored on these sites, promoting the higher photocatalytic activity 52 .The low production rate, or limit of CO or CH 4 product is still a challenge in photocatalysis, which is why MoS 2 is often used as a co-catalyst or composite to assist in efficient charge transfer as discussed in the introduction.MoS 2 can suppress charge transfer, but appears to still need promoting support from other elements.The charges may have relaxed or possibly concentrated in charge density, stifling movement after reaction time, preventing further reaction activity.The H 2 and CH 4 production rates were negligible (0.01 mol-g cat -1 hr -1 ) and not reported for any cases.Low concentration H 2 was difficult to quantify in this study with the low sensitivity of the TCD detector using a He carrier gas.Since CO is an important building block for the production of hydrocarbon fuels, and serves as an important intermediate step for industry, this product was still desirable.It is important to note that these catalysts have not been optimized for activity or selectivity at this stage. The next discussion is focused on the increased activity at elevated temperatures.Literature has not drawn a major conclusion on thermal effects for photocatalytic performance, as most research focuses on low temperature operation to inhibit the photoreaction only (i.e. e -/h -are activated by photons).This low temperature operation has made photocatalysis an appealing sustainable alternative than traditional thermochemical techniques like the reversewater gas shift and Sabatier reactions for CO 2 reduction.If conversion efficiency can be improved and sustained at low temperatures with light activation, the possibilities of applications would be noble for our planet and the energy crisis we face.Different materials have different surface chemistry for adsorption and dissociation properties, so not every photocatalyst at elevated temperature will be beneficial or useful.The positive spike in activity observed at 100 C in this work was a favorable notion that other works should consider running at slightly elevated temperatures if the adsorption and dissociation properties seem favorable.Of course, it would also require material stability at elevated temperatures.According to DFT studies for 2D MoS 2 , water dissociation should occur spontaneously on a 100 Morich edge plane in room temperature and continue to be achievable at elevated temperatures 47 .Mo-rich edge sites have the highest adsorption of H, followed by OH, and finally H 2 O 47 .In this work, we observe through EDS that the increased ramp rate has a decline in S, so can assume we do not have a 100 S-edge, but are unable to determine the exact extent of the edge S concentrations.DFT experiments report that for a 50-100 Mo-rich site, the adsorption of H 2 O, H, and OH are exothermic, with the 100 Mo-edge having the lowest activation energy barrier. 47In our experiments, when the ambient temperature liquid water was present near a basal plane, it may have actually provided repulsion, since the S atoms can shield the surface layer and push away O from the H 2 O molecule.This accounts for the decreased CO evolution at room temperature, at higher ramp rates where \"contamination\" (or less 2D edge sites) was present, as well as in the pristine edges with higher basal planes at the slowest ramp rates (TZF-2).In our experimental work, these upper and lower thresholds of edge exposure and basal plane exposure can be overcome by quantum confinement effects, reducing the activity.It is also important to consider atomic radii and geometry limitations.An S atom can block an Mo atom at the under coordinated edge sites, and so the adsorption energy must overcome the covalent bonds of the reactants during dissociation steps.Here, the increased temperature enabled mobility of the H 2 O vapor in the gas phase, along with a higher rate of adsorption and desorption on the surface sites to dramatically improve activity of CO production.The amplified frequency of collision increased the reaction productivity, enabling higher product evolution than those at room temperature and overcome the ambient energies required for further adsorption and dissociation. The samples treated in H 2 (Fig. 8 B) had increased photoactivity with increased H 2 exposure.30 min of treatment nearly doubled the production rate when compared to that without post treatment.The samples with 30 min of H 2 post treatment (TZF-5-30H 2 ) boosted the overall CO production, but did not increase any consistent H 2 and CH 4 production.The post treatment approach clearly prompted recrystallization of the surfaces as observed in our XRD results with an increased sharpness of the (002) diffraction peak for stacked c-axis orientation, while still maintaining the 3R phase presence.10 and 20 min of treatment was not enough to break the threshold of reaction benefits, and as we observe from XRD, 30 mins allows enough time for further recrystallization which may in fact be required to achieve benefits for higher CO 2 reduction.This would require a more detailed study in its entirety, but an early observation in this preliminary work, shows it is worth pursuing further. The experimental results from this work were compared to control tests with TiO 2 P25 reactions performed in identical reaction conditions at 25 and 100 C, with observed CO evolutions at 0.82 and 0.42 mol/g cat -hr, respectively.The H 2 and CH 4 production rates were negligible (0.01 mol/g cat -hr), which aligns with other literature, where CO 2 photoreduction products are primarily reported as CO, followed by CH 4 or CH 3 OH, and generally when doped with a co-catalyst, such as Cu, Pt, or other precious metal, and not H 2 .TiO 2 supported on glass wool, as in this work, only reported CO and CH 4 production in a H 2 O/CO 2 photoreaction 32 .It is a well-known fact that H 2 O/CO 2 feed molar ratio has a great effect on production rates 53 .Here, we see the decline in production at 100 C.This decline in TiO 2 aligns with literature that reports the optimum range of photocatalysis activity to be between 293 to 353 K due to the rate limiting step of exothermic adsorption of reactants as the boiling temperature of water is approached 54 .In general, it is seen that a temperature threshold of catalysts can be met, and the desorption of products plays an important role in the reaction rate at higher temperatures, while hybrid catalysts have demonstrated higher photocatalytic activity at higher temperature 55 . One option for improved understanding is to enable more e -/h formations through improved reactant availability and how reactants are distributed in the gas phase.Such modifications in future work can shift the selectively for formation of higher hydrocarbons.It is apparent that many vectors contribute to production rates and catalytic activity.Not only does surface chemistry, morphology, intrinsic structural defects and band gap energy require strategy for controllable photocatalytic behavior, but we add the additional notion of thermal effects and using the adsorption/dissociation properties of water advance the photoactivity.Tuning behaviors for MoS 2 without aide of a co-catalyst or dopant are clearly photocatalytic and thermodynamically influential on production rates.Other successes have included layered TMD heterostructures to improve catalytic performance 14,56 .In this work, the introduction of imperfections or atomic vacancies has revealed the modification of flake edge morphology enables increased activity and Eg control for better catalytic performance on high edge site nanoflowers.The synthesis parameters are achievable, controllable, and will be a beneficial focus for future photocatalyst design.One additional improvement in this work that can be made, is providing the S in excess as a precursor at increased ramp rate syntheses, so that excess S may enable a higher quantity of nanoflower abundance in the final product.This may seem counter intuitive to the desire of adding S vacancies, but may reduce the amorphous bulk formation, while still influencing the nanoflower nucleation and thickness, observed in the higher ramp rates in this work."}, {"llm generation": "MoS2 nanoflower powders", "source": "The CVD synthesis of freestanding, durable MoS 2 nanoflower powders were demonstrated to have abundant edge sites that were applied to gas phase photocatalytic reactions.", "context": "The CVD synthesis of freestanding, durable MoS 2 nanoflower powders were demonstrated to have abundant edge sites that were applied to gas phase photocatalytic reactions.Photocatalytic production increased with nanoflower edge-plane density, correlating to DFT literature supporting the rich edge-site exposure enabled more photocatalytic activity due to superior moieties containing unsaturated and dangling bonds than to planar sheet surfaces.The loss of elemental S and increased surface impurities reached a production threshold that is tantamount with declined photocatalytic activity.The Eg was independently tuned during CVD parameters and a post-treatment reduction treatment, with values ranging from 1.38 to 1.83 eV.The facile synthesis with controllable nanoflower formations demonstrated repeatability and a gateway strategy to aid in enhanced understanding of synthetic parameters for the control of defect-laden, well-defined edge-site rich and elegant 2D TMD nanoflower structures.During photoreduction of CO 2 in the presence of H 2 O, CO evolution was the most prominent product, and the effect of surface chemistry and defect states has explained the trends in photoactivity.When treated in a reduction step for 30 min, the production of CO nearly doubled, than those not treated at all or for less time.The introduced edge planes on flake edges and surfaces allowed for under coordinated atoms.This, along with crystal instability and flake thickness demonstrated both beneficial and detrimental effects for the catalytic activity and are an important step towards optimizing photocatalysts.These preliminary developments support controllable gas phase photocatalytic applications, optoelectronics, field emitters, and so on.We also note from this work that the field of photocatalysis must not only consider Earth based applications, but also extra-terrestrial applications, as humans are driving forward Fig. 1 Schematic of the CVD synthesis concept for the single zone furnace (top) and a three zone furnace (bottom).The precursor materials (MoCl 5 and S powder) are carried by Ar, the inert gas, through the quartz tube during heating.Vapor deposition occurred at varying temperature ramp rates and the residual gas departs the quartz tube through a NaOH scrubber before it is vented to the laboratory fume hood.
