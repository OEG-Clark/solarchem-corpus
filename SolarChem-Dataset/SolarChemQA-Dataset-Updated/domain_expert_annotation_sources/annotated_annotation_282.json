Ltd., PLS-SXE-300UV).", "context": "Bi(NO 3 ) 3 A5H 2 O, KI and polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) were analytically pure and from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.Nano-TiO 2 (Degussa P25, 70 in anatase phase and 30 in rutile, particle diameters: 30-50 nm) was from Degussa Corp. In a typical experiment, 0.0028 mol solid Bi(NO 3 ) 3 A5H 2 O was added into 20 mL (0.140 mol/L) KI and (40 g/L) PVP solution with magnetic stirring.After sonicating for 2 min and further magnetic stirring for 5 h at room temperature, the BiOI precipitate was centrifuged, washed with distilled water and dried at 60 C for 8 h.Bulk BiOI was prepared without PVP adding. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was carried out on a multi-purpose high performance X-ray diffractometer (PANalytical, CuKa radiation, l 1.54 A) at a scanning rate of 0.03 s A1 in the 2u range from 15 to 70 , and the current and the voltage used for the powder XRD are 40 kV and 30 mA, respectively).The morphologies were examined by a scanning electron microscope (FEI Sirion200).The TEMimages and SAED-patterns were recorded on a JEOL 2010 electron microscopy, using an accelerating voltage of 200 kV.X-rays photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed by using an AXIS-NOVA (CJ109, Kratos Inc.) in the range of 0-1000 eV for surface composition and surface interaction of nanomaterials.The peaks were calibrated using the C1s level at 284.6 eV as an internal standard.UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) was recorded on a UV-2550 (Shimadzu) UV-vis spectrophotometer and converted from reflection to absorbance by the Kubelka-Munk method.BaSO4 was used as a reference in a UV-vis diffuse reflectance experiment. In the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 , 0.1 g of the catalyst was uniformly dispersed into the glass reactor with an area of 5.4 cm 2 .The light source for the above photoreactivity experiments was a 300 W xenon lamp (Beijing Trusttech Co. Ltd., PLS-SXE-300UV).The volume of the reaction system was about 270 mL.The reaction setup was vacuum-treated several times, and then the high purity CO 2 gas was flowed into the reaction setup to reach ambient pressure.A total of 1 mL of deionized water was injected into the reaction system as the reducer.Photocatalysts were allowed to equilibrate in the CO 2 /H 2 O atmosphere for several hours to ensure that the adsorption of gas molecules was complete.During irradiation at room temperature, about 0.5 mL of gas was continuously taken from the reaction cell at given time intervals for subsequent CH 4 concentration analysis by using a gas chromatography (GC-14B and GC8A; Shimadzu Corp., Japan).Control experiments showed that no appreciable reduced C1 or C2 products were detected in the absence of H 2 O, CO 2 , photocatalyst or light irradiation, illustrating that H 2 O, CO 2 , photocatalyst and light irradiation were necessary for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction."}, {"llm generation": "Xenon lamp", "source": "As shown in Fig. 6, under xenon lamp irradiation, the low-energy part (irradiation energy is lower than 2.64 eV) cannot induce the CH 4 generation because the reformed CBM potential is lower than the CBM potential rather than E 0 (CO 2 /CH 4 ) (A0.24 eV).", "context": "The XRD patterns in Fig. 1 show that all of the diffraction peaks were in good agreement with the tetragonal phase of BiOI (JCPDS no.10-0445); meanwhile no other impurity peaks were observed.It can be found that there are three peaks (0 0 2), (1 0 2) and (11 0) at 2u of 19.36 , 29.57 and 31.71, respectively.Moreover, the sharp diffraction peaks indicated that the as-prepared samples were well-crystallized.All the diffraction peaks can be indexed to the tetragonal structure of BiOI with space group of P4/nmm (JCPDS, 85-0863).The XPS measurements provided further information for the evaluation of the purity and surface composition of the BiOI flowerlike hierarchical structure.The XPS survey spectrum in Fig. 2a demonstrates, no peaks of other elements other than C, O, Bi and I in the sample, a proof of the purity of BiOI flowerlike hierarchical structure.Fig. 2b shows the high-resolution XPS spectra of Bi 4f.The two strong peaks at the Bi region of 159.1 eV and 164.4 eV are assigned to Bi 4f7/2 and Bi 4f5/2 of BiOI, respectively. In order to investigate the detailed crystal structure of BiOI hierarchical structure, FESEM, TEM and HRTEM were carried out, and the results are shown in Fig. 3.The typical overall SEM and TEM image (Fig. 3a andc) shows that the obtained products are uniform flowerlike spheres.These spheres have an average size of 600 nm in diameter.Fig. 3b reveals that the flower is composed of several dozen nanosheets.The nanosheets are ca.400 nm in plane size and 30 nm in thickness.The HRTEM image of a single nanosheet (viewed from the 0 0 1 axis) in Fig. 3d shows clearly the lattice fringes with a lattice spacing of 0.28 nm, corresponding to that of the 11 0 facets.From the above structural analysis it can be concluded that the nanosheets are single crystals and grow along the orientations, which are perpendicular to the c axis of the tetragonal structure 16. Fig. 4 shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of BiOI flowerlike hierarchical structure.It can be seen that the absorption band ranges from 300 nm to 600 nm, with high absorption.The obvious absorption edge is located at about 677 nm in the visible light region.The band gap energy of BiOI flowerlike hierarchical structure and irregular BiOI are estimated to be 1.83 eV.This observed bandgap agrees well with the previous reports 17181920.Red BiOI flowerlike hierarchical structure can absorb most of the visible light and can be excited under sunlight irradiation. We performed CO 2 and gaseous H 2 O photocatalysis in a gassolid system over BiOI 3D structure, bulk BiOI and TiO 2 under sunlight irradiation in the absence of any cocatalysts.Gas chromatographic analysis shows that CH 4 was exclusively obtained as the reduction product without detectable CH 3 OH, H 2 , and CO as secondary products.A control experiment showed that no appreciable reduced C1 or C2 products were detected in the absence BiOI and TiO 2 under sunlight irradiation (Fig. 5a).On the other hand, Fig. 5b showed the O 2 generation over BiOI and TiO 2 under sunlight irradiation.It indicated that water was a reductant for CO 2 reduction.The gross yield in CH 4 increased with the photolysis time (Fig. 5a), and the total yield of CH 4 of BiOI 3D structure obtained in the experiment after 8 h of continuous irradiation, was 1.58 mmol.In comparison, the total yield of CH 4 of BiOI and TiO 2 only were 0.68 mmol and 0.12 mmol, respectively. The band edge positions of BiOI were estimated using the equation related to Mulliken electronegativity.Herein, the electronegativity of an atom is the arithmetic mean of the atomic electron affinity and the first ionization energy.The conduction band minimum (CBM) and valence band maximum (VBM) potentials can be calculated according to empirical equations 21222324: where ECB is the CBM edge potential, x is the absolute electronegativity of the semiconductor which is the geometric mean of the electronegativity of the constituent atoms, E e is the energy of free electrons on hydrogen scale (about 4.5 eV), E g is the As shown in Fig. 6, under xenon lamp irradiation, the lowenergy part (irradiation energy is lower than 2.64 eV) cannot induce the CH 4 generation because the reformed CBM potential is lower than the CBM potential rather than E 0 (CO 2 /CH 4 ) (A0.24 eV).But the high-energy part (irradiation energy is higher than 2.64 eV (l 470 nm)) can result in the photogenerated electrons exciting up to a reformed higher CBM potential than E 0 (CO 2 /CH 4 ) (A0.24 eV).Therefore, the electrons on the CBM of BiOI can react with CO 2 to produce CH 4 .And the photoinduced holes can be consumed by H 2 O to from O 2 .At the end, it should be pointed out that this photocatalytic mechanism has been proved, and it can be used to explain the photocatalytic mechanism about photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 ."}, {"llm generation": "xenon lamp", "source": "Fig. 5.
