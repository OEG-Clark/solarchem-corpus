The morphologies of Bi 2 WO 6 samples were observed by SEM and are shown in Fig. 2. The different treatments clearly changed catalyst morphology, producing samples of different sizes and shapes.Samples synthesized using lower surfactant concentration and shorter synthesis times (W-8h-10) had a spherical morphology with an average diameter of 4 m.The presence of microspheres with flower-like morphology was also evident (Fig. 2a1).Sample W-8h-50 (Fig. 2b) had no specific morphology, where excess PVP in synthesis caused cluster formation, producing a catalyst consisting of a mix of many blocks with a rough surface. Samples W-16-30 and W-24h-10 exhibited a spherical shape with average diameters of 3 and 5 m, respectively.The high-magnification SEM images depicted in Fig. 2c andd reveal that spherical microstructures were made up of thin plates 12-to 15-nm thick (Fig. 2c1 andd1).In the W-24h-10 sample (Fig. 2d1), however, some of these nanoplates agglomerated around the spheres, precluding a smooth surface structure like that of the W-16h-30 sample. Greater time periods and PVP concentration (W-24h-50) promoted the formation of dense spherical particles with an average diameter of 3 m (Fig. 2e).The presence of clusters with different sizes and no specific morphology was also observed in this catalyst. In a previous study (Ribeiro et al. 2019), the authors showed that synthesis time alone was not sufficient to modify sample morphology.Therefore, it can be concluded that the change in PVP concentration along with synthesis time were responsible for modifying the morphology of the Bi 2 WO 6 catalysts. According to Zhang et al. (2016), as synthesis begins, orthorhombic Bi 2 WO 6 nuclei consisting of Bi 2 O 2 2 layers interspersed between WO 6 octahedral layers are formed.This process gives rise to the primary 2D nanosheets of Bi 2 WO 6 due to the initial high concentration of the precursor Bi 3 and WO 4 .In the presence of PVP, these nanosheets can be stabilized by surface adsorption of PVP molecular chains.When a high molecular weight PVP, such as PVP K30, is used, the longer molecular chains induce the formation of more and more nanoplates on the surface, leading to the formation of well-structured spheres.At higher PVP concentrations, however, the large amount of nanoplates present in the medium can lead to the generation of denser particles and clumps. In almost all samples, the time variation and surfactant addition increased surface area when compared with samples without surfactant (Table 2), which is in agreement with the ANOVA table for specific surface area (Table S1) that showed that both time and PVP concentration are significant variables.That is, within the studied range, catalysts synthesized using shorter time periods and lower PVP concentrations (W-8h-10, W-16h-30, and W-24h-10) had higher Fig. 1 XRD patterns of Bi 2 WO 6 catalyst prepared using different hydrothermal times and amounts of PVP specific surface areas.These samples presented wellstructured sphere morphology that usually has large number of interspaces due to the self-assembly of nanoplates, which can promote a pore volume increase, increasing the specific surface area of the catalyst.Moreover, the sample with higher area is W-8h-10, possibly due to the presence of the open flower-like structure.The formation of denser particles and agglomerates at higher PVP concentrations led to a decrease in surface area. The UV-vis diffuse absorption spectra of Bi 2 WO 6 catalysts are presented in Fig. 3.The steepness of the spectra indicates that the energy absorption was due to band gap transition rather than impurity level transition.Also, all samples showed intense absorption in UV and visible-light regions, suggesting that they can be photoexcited under visible-light radiation. Changes in time and PVP concentration had no significant influence on Bi 2 WO 6 band gap (Table S2).On the other hand, compared with samples without PVP addition, the band gap was gradually shortened and a slight red shift of the absorption band edge occurred with increasing PVP concentration.This PVP influence on band gap has been previously reported in the studies of Zhong et al. (2016) and Zhang et al. (2016) and is a strong indicator that the use of PVP in Bi 2 WO 6 synthesis could regulate band gap and improve catalyst visible-light absorption.The band gap values were determined by using the classical Tauc approach and are given in Table 2. The zeta potential measurement, which provides information about the electric charges on the catalyst surface, revealed that all samples are negative on the surface in a deionized water medium (Table 2).The zeta potential values are all of the same order of magnitude with only a slight difference among them.This is in agreement with the ANOVA table (Table S3), as it shows that none of the variable was significant for zeta potential. The main product of the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was ethanol, and ethanol production rate was therefore chosen as the experimental design response.It is worth noting that, due to the potential of conduction band of Bi 2 WO 6 , it is impossible for electrons to be formed to reduce CO 2 molecule into ethanol (Eq.1).Therefore, the most feasible mechanism is that ethanol is not being generated directly from CO 2 molecule physically absorbed on the catalyst, but through the intermediates, like H 2 CO 3 , HCO 3 -, and CO 3 2-, coupled with the catalyst surface.These species have more reactive bent C-O bonds compared with the linear CO 2 molecule, hence, it presented lower reduction potentials, which facilitate the formation of the CO 2 -radical anions.In addition, the high formation of ethanol indicates a C-C coupling of these anion intermediates with another intermediates nearby, leading to a dimerization, via a radicalsubstrate reaction mechanism that gives rise to C 2 H 5 OH as the major product (Dai et al. 2017;Liu et al. 2009;Silva Ribeiro and Azario Lansarin 2019;Vu et al. 2017).Fig. 3 UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra for Bi 2 WO 6 catalysts.Insets are the corresponding plots of (Abs.) 2 (h) 2 /eV 2 against photon energy Ethanol yield (mol g -1 h -1 ) 1 W-8h-10 68.9 2 W-8h-50 24.9 3 W-24h-10 34.6 4 W-24h-50 13.1 5 W-16h-30 27.9 6 3 1 .3 7 3 3 .8 Table 3 shows the C 2 H 5 OH yield at each point of the experimental design.The experimental error, calculated from the center point triplicate, was 7, and the predicted results fit approximately 97 of the experimental data. The Pareto chart, which shows the effects of the factors on the response, can be seen in Fig. 4a.Both time and PVP concentration were statistically significant and had a negative effect.In other words, a shorter time period and lower surfactant concentration promoted greater Bi 2 WO 6 photocatalytic activity, within the range studied.This same behavior can also be seen in Fig. 4b.Moreover, samples with the spherical morphology and largest specific surface area presented higher ethanol yield, implying that the morphology and specific surface area are the key factors affecting the photocatalytic performance. The best result was obtained for sample W-8h-10, which had a flower-like morphology.As shown in earlier studies, hierarchical and porous structures have more efficient surface adsorption of reactants and faster photogenerated carrier separation, leading to an enhance photocatalytic activity of bismuth catalysts.Compared with other morphologies, the flower-like structure is more open, providing more exposure sites for CO 2 adsorption, as well as favoring electron capture for the reduction reaction due to the multiple reflections of incident light (Dai et al. 2016;Yang et al. 2016;Ye et al. 2019).The combination between flower-like morphology and large surface area could explain the excellent performance of this sample. The surfactant addition clearly improved, in most cases, the photocatalytic performance of the bismuth tungstate catalyst.The ethanol yield of the sample without PVP, for the same synthesis time, was 1.6 times lower than that obtained with sample W-16h-30, which evidences that the photocatalytic activity of Bi 2 WO 6 depends on crystallinity, morphology, and mostly, surface area. In order to gain a better understanding of the effects of the PVP on Bi 2 WO 6 synthesis, catalysts with lower PVP concentrations were prepared and evaluated for CO 2 photoreduction.As revealed in Table 4, catalysts synthesized with small amounts of surfactant (5 and 7) had lower photocatalytic activity than the W-8h-10 sample. Low concentrations of PVP proved insufficient to induce the formation of flower-like morphology or a large increase in catalyst surface area.Figure 5 summarizes all the results for ethanol yield achieved in this work.The sample W-8h-10 was the catalyst with the best photocatalytic activity in this study.With this sample, it was possible to achieve a 68.9 mol g -1 h -1 yield of ethanol, which represents a higher ethanol production under visible-light irradiation with bismuth catalysts, when compared with previous reports (Dai Dai et al. 2017;Dai et al. 2016).Therefore, it is a promising material for use in CO 2 photoreduction."}, {"llm generation": "Bi 2 WO6 catalyst", "source": "These results demonstrate that PVP can selectively absorb on some specific planes, conferring an anisotropic structure and morphology to the Bi 2 WO6 catalyst (Dai et al. 2016;Zhong et al. 2016).", "context": "The XRD results for as-prepared Bi 2 WO 6 catalysts with and without PVP addition are shown in Fig. 1.The surfactant concentration and synthesis time, however, strongly influenced the sample's crystallinity.Catalysts synthesized with lower PVP concentration and longer synthesis time exhibited higher crystallinity, i.e., better-defined peaks with higher intensity.Moreover, for samples with and without the surfactant addition synthesized for 16 h, PVP improved Bi 2 WO 6 crystallinity.Lastly, the average ratio of intensity of the (131)/(200) peaks was 1.60, lower than ratios for the product synthesized without PVP (2.30) and for the standard data (4.70).These results demonstrate that PVP can selectively absorb on some specific planes, conferring an anisotropic structure and morphology to the Bi 2 WO6 catalyst (Dai et al. 2016;Zhong et al. 2016).

Samples W-16-30 and W-24h-10 exhibited a spherical shape with average diameters of 3 and 5 m, respectively.The high-magnification SEM images depicted in Fig. 2c andd reveal that spherical microstructures were made up of thin plates 12-to 15-nm thick (Fig. 2c1 andd1).In the W-24h-10 sample (Fig. 2d1), however, some of these nanoplates agglomerated around the spheres, precluding a smooth surface structure like that of the W-16h-30 sample. Greater time periods and PVP concentration (W-24h-50) promoted the formation of dense spherical particles with an average diameter of 3 m (Fig. 2e).The presence of clusters with different sizes and no specific morphology was also observed in this catalyst. In a previous study (Ribeiro et al. 2019), the authors showed that synthesis time alone was not sufficient to modify sample morphology.Therefore, it can be concluded that the change in PVP concentration along with synthesis time were responsible for modifying the morphology of the Bi 2 WO 6 catalysts. According to Zhang et al. (2016), as synthesis begins, orthorhombic Bi 2 WO 6 nuclei consisting of Bi 2 O 2 2 layers interspersed between WO 6 octahedral layers are formed.This process gives rise to the primary 2D nanosheets of Bi 2 WO 6 due to the initial high concentration of the precursor Bi 3 and WO 4 .In the presence of PVP, these nanosheets can be stabilized by surface adsorption of PVP molecular chains.When a high molecular weight PVP, such as PVP K30, is used, the longer molecular chains induce the formation of more and more nanoplates on the surface, leading to the formation of well-structured spheres.At higher PVP concentrations, however, the large amount of nanoplates present in the medium can lead to the generation of denser particles and clumps. In almost all samples, the time variation and surfactant addition increased surface area when compared with samples without surfactant (Table 2), which is in agreement with the ANOVA table for specific surface area (Table S1) that showed that both time and PVP concentration are significant variables.That is, within the studied range, catalysts synthesized using shorter time periods and lower PVP concentrations (W-8h-10, W-16h-30, and W-24h-10) had higher Fig. 1 XRD patterns of Bi 2 WO 6 catalyst prepared using different hydrothermal times and amounts of PVP specific surface areas.These samples presented wellstructured sphere morphology that usually has large number of interspaces due to the self-assembly of nanoplates, which can promote a pore volume increase, increasing the specific surface area of the catalyst.Moreover, the sample with higher area is W-8h-10, possibly due to the presence of the open flower-like structure.The formation of denser particles and agglomerates at higher PVP concentrations led to a decrease in surface area. The UV-vis diffuse absorption spectra of Bi 2 WO 6 catalysts are presented in Fig. 3.The steepness of the spectra indicates that the energy absorption was due to band gap transition rather than impurity level transition.Also, all samples showed intense absorption in UV and visible-light regions, suggesting that they can be photoexcited under visible-light radiation. Changes in time and PVP concentration had no significant influence on Bi 2 WO 6 band gap (Table S2).On the other hand, compared with samples without PVP addition, the band gap was gradually shortened and a slight red shift of the absorption band edge occurred with increasing PVP concentration.This PVP influence on band gap has been previously reported in the studies of Zhong et al. (2016) and Zhang et al. (2016) and is a strong indicator that the use of PVP in Bi 2 WO 6 synthesis could regulate band gap and improve catalyst visible-light absorption.The band gap values were determined by using the classical Tauc approach and are given in Table 2. The zeta potential measurement, which provides information about the electric charges on the catalyst surface, revealed that all samples are negative on the surface in a deionized water medium (Table 2).The zeta potential values are all of the same order of magnitude with only a slight difference among them.This is in agreement with the ANOVA table (Table S3), as it shows that none of the variable was significant for zeta potential. The main product of the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was ethanol, and ethanol production rate was therefore chosen as the experimental design response.It is worth noting that, due to the potential of conduction band of Bi 2 WO 6 , it is impossible for electrons to be formed to reduce CO 2 molecule into ethanol (Eq.1).Therefore, the most feasible mechanism is that ethanol is not being generated directly from CO 2 molecule physically absorbed on the catalyst, but through the intermediates, like H 2 CO 3 , HCO 3 -, and CO 3 2-, coupled with the catalyst surface.These species have more reactive bent C-O bonds compared with the linear CO 2 molecule, hence, it presented lower reduction potentials, which facilitate the formation of the CO 2 -radical anions.In addition, the high formation of ethanol indicates a C-C coupling of these anion intermediates with another intermediates nearby, leading to a dimerization, via a radicalsubstrate reaction mechanism that gives rise to C 2 H 5 OH as the major product (Dai et al. 2017;Liu et al. 2009;Silva Ribeiro and Azario Lansarin 2019;Vu et al. 2017).Fig. 3 UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra for Bi 2 WO 6 catalysts.Insets are the corresponding plots of (Abs.) 2 (h) 2 /eV 2 against photon energy Ethanol yield (mol g -1 h -1 ) 1 W-8h-10 68.9 2 W-8h-50 24.9 3 W-24h-10 34.6 4 W-24h-50 13.1 5 W-16h-30 27.9 6 3 1 .3 7 3 3 .8 Table 3 shows the C 2 H 5 OH yield at each point of the experimental design.The experimental error, calculated from the center point triplicate, was 7, and the predicted results fit approximately 97 of the experimental data. The Pareto chart, which shows the effects of the factors on the response, can be seen in Fig. 4a.Both time and PVP concentration were statistically significant and had a negative effect.In other words, a shorter time period and lower surfactant concentration promoted greater Bi 2 WO 6 photocatalytic activity, within the range studied.This same behavior can also be seen in Fig. 4b.Moreover, samples with the spherical morphology and largest specific surface area presented higher ethanol yield, implying that the morphology and specific surface area are the key factors affecting the photocatalytic performance. The best result was obtained for sample W-8h-10, which had a flower-like morphology.As shown in earlier studies, hierarchical and porous structures have more efficient surface adsorption of reactants and faster photogenerated carrier separation, leading to an enhance photocatalytic activity of bismuth catalysts.Compared with other morphologies, the flower-like structure is more open, providing more exposure sites for CO 2 adsorption, as well as favoring electron capture for the reduction reaction due to the multiple reflections of incident light (Dai et al. 2016;Yang et al. 2016;Ye et al. 2019).The combination between flower-like morphology and large surface area could explain the excellent performance of this sample. The surfactant addition clearly improved, in most cases, the photocatalytic performance of the bismuth tungstate catalyst.The ethanol yield of the sample without PVP, for the same synthesis time, was 1.6 times lower than that obtained with sample W-16h-30, which evidences that the photocatalytic activity of Bi 2 WO 6 depends on crystallinity, morphology, and mostly, surface area. In order to gain a better understanding of the effects of the PVP on Bi 2 WO 6 synthesis, catalysts with lower PVP concentrations were prepared and evaluated for CO 2 photoreduction.As revealed in Table 4, catalysts synthesized with small amounts of surfactant (5 and 7) had lower photocatalytic activity than the W-8h-10 sample. Low concentrations of PVP proved insufficient to induce the formation of flower-like morphology or a large increase in catalyst surface area.Figure 5 summarizes all the results for ethanol yield achieved in this work.The sample W-8h-10 was the catalyst with the best photocatalytic activity in this study.With this sample, it was possible to achieve a 68.9 mol g -1 h -1 yield of ethanol, which represents a higher ethanol production under visible-light irradiation with bismuth catalysts, when compared with previous reports (Dai Dai et al. 2017;Dai et al. 2016).Therefore, it is a promising material for use in CO 2 photoreduction."}, {"llm generation": "Bi 2 WO 6", "source": "This PVP influence on band gap has been previously reported in the studies of Zhong et al.

The morphologies of Bi 2 WO 6 samples were observed by SEM and are shown in Fig. 2. The different treatments clearly changed catalyst morphology, producing samples of different sizes and shapes.Samples synthesized using lower surfactant concentration and shorter synthesis times (W-8h-10) had a spherical morphology with an average diameter of 4 m.The presence of microspheres with flower-like morphology was also evident (Fig. 2a1).Sample W-8h-50 (Fig. 2b) had no specific morphology, where excess PVP in synthesis caused cluster formation, producing a catalyst consisting of a mix of many blocks with a rough surface. Samples W-16-30 and W-24h-10 exhibited a spherical shape with average diameters of 3 and 5 m, respectively.The high-magnification SEM images depicted in Fig. 2c andd reveal that spherical microstructures were made up of thin plates 12-to 15-nm thick (Fig. 2c1 andd1).In the W-24h-10 sample (Fig. 2d1), however, some of these nanoplates agglomerated around the spheres, precluding a smooth surface structure like that of the W-16h-30 sample. Greater time periods and PVP concentration (W-24h-50) promoted the formation of dense spherical particles with an average diameter of 3 m (Fig. 2e).The presence of clusters with different sizes and no specific morphology was also observed in this catalyst. In a previous study (Ribeiro et al. 2019), the authors showed that synthesis time alone was not sufficient to modify sample morphology.Therefore, it can be concluded that the change in PVP concentration along with synthesis time were responsible for modifying the morphology of the Bi 2 WO 6 catalysts. According to Zhang et al. (2016), as synthesis begins, orthorhombic Bi 2 WO 6 nuclei consisting of Bi 2 O 2 2 layers interspersed between WO 6 octahedral layers are formed.This process gives rise to the primary 2D nanosheets of Bi 2 WO 6 due to the initial high concentration of the precursor Bi 3 and WO 4 .In the presence of PVP, these nanosheets can be stabilized by surface adsorption of PVP molecular chains.When a high molecular weight PVP, such as PVP K30, is used, the longer molecular chains induce the formation of more and more nanoplates on the surface, leading to the formation of well-structured spheres.At higher PVP concentrations, however, the large amount of nanoplates present in the medium can lead to the generation of denser particles and clumps. In almost all samples, the time variation and surfactant addition increased surface area when compared with samples without surfactant (Table 2), which is in agreement with the ANOVA table for specific surface area (Table S1) that showed that both time and PVP concentration are significant variables.That is, within the studied range, catalysts synthesized using shorter time periods and lower PVP concentrations (W-8h-10, W-16h-30, and W-24h-10) had higher Fig. 1 XRD patterns of Bi 2 WO 6 catalyst prepared using different hydrothermal times and amounts of PVP specific surface areas.These samples presented wellstructured sphere morphology that usually has large number of interspaces due to the self-assembly of nanoplates, which can promote a pore volume increase, increasing the specific surface area of the catalyst.Moreover, the sample with higher area is W-8h-10, possibly due to the presence of the open flower-like structure.The formation of denser particles and agglomerates at higher PVP concentrations led to a decrease in surface area. The UV-vis diffuse absorption spectra of Bi 2 WO 6 catalysts are presented in Fig. 3.The steepness of the spectra indicates that the energy absorption was due to band gap transition rather than impurity level transition.Also, all samples showed intense absorption in UV and visible-light regions, suggesting that they can be photoexcited under visible-light radiation. Changes in time and PVP concentration had no significant influence on Bi 2 WO 6 band gap (Table S2).On the other hand, compared with samples without PVP addition, the band gap was gradually shortened and a slight red shift of the absorption band edge occurred with increasing PVP concentration.This PVP influence on band gap has been previously reported in the studies of Zhong et al. (2016) and Zhang et al. (2016) and is a strong indicator that the use of PVP in Bi 2 WO 6 synthesis could regulate band gap and improve catalyst visible-light absorption.The band gap values were determined by using the classical Tauc approach and are given in Table 2. The zeta potential measurement, which provides information about the electric charges on the catalyst surface, revealed that all samples are negative on the surface in a deionized water medium (Table 2).The zeta potential values are all of the same order of magnitude with only a slight difference among them.This is in agreement with the ANOVA table (Table S3), as it shows that none of the variable was significant for zeta potential. The main product of the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was ethanol, and ethanol production rate was therefore chosen as the experimental design response.It is worth noting that, due to the potential of conduction band of Bi 2 WO 6 , it is impossible for electrons to be formed to reduce CO 2 molecule into ethanol (Eq.1).Therefore, the most feasible mechanism is that ethanol is not being generated directly from CO 2 molecule physically absorbed on the catalyst, but through the intermediates, like H 2 CO 3 , HCO 3 -, and CO 3 2-, coupled with the catalyst surface.These species have more reactive bent C-O bonds compared with the linear CO 2 molecule, hence, it presented lower reduction potentials, which facilitate the formation of the CO 2 -radical anions.In addition, the high formation of ethanol indicates a C-C coupling of these anion intermediates with another intermediates nearby, leading to a dimerization, via a radicalsubstrate reaction mechanism that gives rise to C 2 H 5 OH as the major product (Dai et al. 2017;Liu et al. 2009;Silva Ribeiro and Azario Lansarin 2019;Vu et al. 2017).Fig. 3 UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra for Bi 2 WO 6 catalysts.Insets are the corresponding plots of (Abs.) 2 (h) 2 /eV 2 against photon energy Ethanol yield (mol g -1 h -1 ) 1 W-8h-10 68.9 2 W-8h-50 24.9 3 W-24h-10 34.6 4 W-24h-50 13.1 5 W-16h-30 27.9 6 3 1 .3 7 3 3 .8 Table 3 shows the C 2 H 5 OH yield at each point of the experimental design.The experimental error, calculated from the center point triplicate, was 7, and the predicted results fit approximately 97 of the experimental data. The Pareto chart, which shows the effects of the factors on the response, can be seen in Fig. 4a.Both time and PVP concentration were statistically significant and had a negative effect.In other words, a shorter time period and lower surfactant concentration promoted greater Bi 2 WO 6 photocatalytic activity, within the range studied.This same behavior can also be seen in Fig. 4b.Moreover, samples with the spherical morphology and largest specific surface area presented higher ethanol yield, implying that the morphology and specific surface area are the key factors affecting the photocatalytic performance. The best result was obtained for sample W-8h-10, which had a flower-like morphology.As shown in earlier studies, hierarchical and porous structures have more efficient surface adsorption of reactants and faster photogenerated carrier separation, leading to an enhance photocatalytic activity of bismuth catalysts.Compared with other morphologies, the flower-like structure is more open, providing more exposure sites for CO 2 adsorption, as well as favoring electron capture for the reduction reaction due to the multiple reflections of incident light (Dai et al. 2016;Yang et al. 2016;Ye et al. 2019).The combination between flower-like morphology and large surface area could explain the excellent performance of this sample. The surfactant addition clearly improved, in most cases, the photocatalytic performance of the bismuth tungstate catalyst.The ethanol yield of the sample without PVP, for the same synthesis time, was 1.6 times lower than that obtained with sample W-16h-30, which evidences that the photocatalytic activity of Bi 2 WO 6 depends on crystallinity, morphology, and mostly, surface area. In order to gain a better understanding of the effects of the PVP on Bi 2 WO 6 synthesis, catalysts with lower PVP concentrations were prepared and evaluated for CO 2 photoreduction.As revealed in Table 4, catalysts synthesized with small amounts of surfactant (5 and 7) had lower photocatalytic activity than the W-8h-10 sample. Low concentrations of PVP proved insufficient to induce the formation of flower-like morphology or a large increase in catalyst surface area.Figure 5 summarizes all the results for ethanol yield achieved in this work.The sample W-8h-10 was the catalyst with the best photocatalytic activity in this study.With this sample, it was possible to achieve a 68.9 mol g -1 h -1 yield of ethanol, which represents a higher ethanol production under visible-light irradiation with bismuth catalysts, when compared with previous reports (Dai Dai et al. 2017;Dai et al. 2016).Therefore, it is a promising material for use in CO 2 photoreduction."}, {"llm generation": "UV-Vis", "source": "This PVP influence on band gap has been previously reported in the studies of Zhong et al.

Samples W-16-30 and W-24h-10 exhibited a spherical shape with average diameters of 3 and 5 m, respectively.The high-magnification SEM images depicted in Fig. 2c andd reveal that spherical microstructures were made up of thin plates 12-to 15-nm thick (Fig. 2c1 andd1).In the W-24h-10 sample (Fig. 2d1), however, some of these nanoplates agglomerated around the spheres, precluding a smooth surface structure like that of the W-16h-30 sample. Greater time periods and PVP concentration (W-24h-50) promoted the formation of dense spherical particles with an average diameter of 3 m (Fig. 2e).The presence of clusters with different sizes and no specific morphology was also observed in this catalyst. In a previous study (Ribeiro et al. 2019), the authors showed that synthesis time alone was not sufficient to modify sample morphology.Therefore, it can be concluded that the change in PVP concentration along with synthesis time were responsible for modifying the morphology of the Bi 2 WO 6 catalysts. According to Zhang et al. (2016), as synthesis begins, orthorhombic Bi 2 WO 6 nuclei consisting of Bi 2 O 2 2 layers interspersed between WO 6 octahedral layers are formed.This process gives rise to the primary 2D nanosheets of Bi 2 WO 6 due to the initial high concentration of the precursor Bi 3 and WO 4 .In the presence of PVP, these nanosheets can be stabilized by surface adsorption of PVP molecular chains.When a high molecular weight PVP, such as PVP K30, is used, the longer molecular chains induce the formation of more and more nanoplates on the surface, leading to the formation of well-structured spheres.At higher PVP concentrations, however, the large amount of nanoplates present in the medium can lead to the generation of denser particles and clumps. In almost all samples, the time variation and surfactant addition increased surface area when compared with samples without surfactant (Table 2), which is in agreement with the ANOVA table for specific surface area (Table S1) that showed that both time and PVP concentration are significant variables.That is, within the studied range, catalysts synthesized using shorter time periods and lower PVP concentrations (W-8h-10, W-16h-30, and W-24h-10) had higher Fig. 1 XRD patterns of Bi 2 WO 6 catalyst prepared using different hydrothermal times and amounts of PVP specific surface areas.These samples presented wellstructured sphere morphology that usually has large number of interspaces due to the self-assembly of nanoplates, which can promote a pore volume increase, increasing the specific surface area of the catalyst.Moreover, the sample with higher area is W-8h-10, possibly due to the presence of the open flower-like structure.The formation of denser particles and agglomerates at higher PVP concentrations led to a decrease in surface area. The UV-vis diffuse absorption spectra of Bi 2 WO 6 catalysts are presented in Fig. 3.The steepness of the spectra indicates that the energy absorption was due to band gap transition rather than impurity level transition.Also, all samples showed intense absorption in UV and visible-light regions, suggesting that they can be photoexcited under visible-light radiation. Changes in time and PVP concentration had no significant influence on Bi 2 WO 6 band gap (Table S2).On the other hand, compared with samples without PVP addition, the band gap was gradually shortened and a slight red shift of the absorption band edge occurred with increasing PVP concentration.This PVP influence on band gap has been previously reported in the studies of Zhong et al. (2016) and Zhang et al. (2016) and is a strong indicator that the use of PVP in Bi 2 WO 6 synthesis could regulate band gap and improve catalyst visible-light absorption.The band gap values were determined by using the classical Tauc approach and are given in Table 2. The zeta potential measurement, which provides information about the electric charges on the catalyst surface, revealed that all samples are negative on the surface in a deionized water medium (Table 2).The zeta potential values are all of the same order of magnitude with only a slight difference among them.This is in agreement with the ANOVA table (Table S3), as it shows that none of the variable was significant for zeta potential. The main product of the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was ethanol, and ethanol production rate was therefore chosen as the experimental design response.It is worth noting that, due to the potential of conduction band of Bi 2 WO 6 , it is impossible for electrons to be formed to reduce CO 2 molecule into ethanol (Eq.1).Therefore, the most feasible mechanism is that ethanol is not being generated directly from CO 2 molecule physically absorbed on the catalyst, but through the intermediates, like H 2 CO 3 , HCO 3 -, and CO 3 2-, coupled with the catalyst surface.These species have more reactive bent C-O bonds compared with the linear CO 2 molecule, hence, it presented lower reduction potentials, which facilitate the formation of the CO 2 -radical anions.In addition, the high formation of ethanol indicates a C-C coupling of these anion intermediates with another intermediates nearby, leading to a dimerization, via a radicalsubstrate reaction mechanism that gives rise to C 2 H 5 OH as the major product (Dai et al. 2017;Liu et al. 2009;Silva Ribeiro and Azario Lansarin 2019;Vu et al. 2017).Fig. 3 UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra for Bi 2 WO 6 catalysts.Insets are the corresponding plots of (Abs.) 2 (h) 2 /eV 2 against photon energy Ethanol yield (mol g -1 h -1 ) 1 W-8h-10 68.9 2 W-8h-50 24.9 3 W-24h-10 34.6 4 W-24h-50 13.1 5 W-16h-30 27.9 6 3 1 .3 7 3 3 .8 Table 3 shows the C 2 H 5 OH yield at each point of the experimental design.The experimental error, calculated from the center point triplicate, was 7, and the predicted results fit approximately 97 of the experimental data. The Pareto chart, which shows the effects of the factors on the response, can be seen in Fig. 4a.Both time and PVP concentration were statistically significant and had a negative effect.In other words, a shorter time period and lower surfactant concentration promoted greater Bi 2 WO 6 photocatalytic activity, within the range studied.This same behavior can also be seen in Fig. 4b.Moreover, samples with the spherical morphology and largest specific surface area presented higher ethanol yield, implying that the morphology and specific surface area are the key factors affecting the photocatalytic performance. The best result was obtained for sample W-8h-10, which had a flower-like morphology.As shown in earlier studies, hierarchical and porous structures have more efficient surface adsorption of reactants and faster photogenerated carrier separation, leading to an enhance photocatalytic activity of bismuth catalysts.Compared with other morphologies, the flower-like structure is more open, providing more exposure sites for CO 2 adsorption, as well as favoring electron capture for the reduction reaction due to the multiple reflections of incident light (Dai et al. 2016;Yang et al. 2016;Ye et al. 2019).The combination between flower-like morphology and large surface area could explain the excellent performance of this sample. The surfactant addition clearly improved, in most cases, the photocatalytic performance of the bismuth tungstate catalyst.The ethanol yield of the sample without PVP, for the same synthesis time, was 1.6 times lower than that obtained with sample W-16h-30, which evidences that the photocatalytic activity of Bi 2 WO 6 depends on crystallinity, morphology, and mostly, surface area. In order to gain a better understanding of the effects of the PVP on Bi 2 WO 6 synthesis, catalysts with lower PVP concentrations were prepared and evaluated for CO 2 photoreduction.As revealed in Table 4, catalysts synthesized with small amounts of surfactant (5 and 7) had lower photocatalytic activity than the W-8h-10 sample. Low concentrations of PVP proved insufficient to induce the formation of flower-like morphology or a large increase in catalyst surface area.Figure 5 summarizes all the results for ethanol yield achieved in this work.The sample W-8h-10 was the catalyst with the best photocatalytic activity in this study.With this sample, it was possible to achieve a 68.9 mol g -1 h -1 yield of ethanol, which represents a higher ethanol production under visible-light irradiation with bismuth catalysts, when compared with previous reports (Dai Dai et al. 2017;Dai et al. 2016).Therefore, it is a promising material for use in CO 2 photoreduction."}, {"llm generation": "visible light", "source": "The effect of time and the addition of different concentrations of PVP in Bi 2 WO 6 synthesis was evaluated for CO 2 photocatalytic reduction under visible light using an experimental design.", "context": "The effect of time and the addition of different concentrations of PVP in Bi 2 WO 6 synthesis was evaluated for CO 2 photocatalytic reduction under visible light using an experimental design.Both variables (synthesis time and PVP) influenced ethanol production, and the results revealed that PVP concentration was the most important statistically significant variable, with the best results obtained at the lower level (-1) of this factor.The highest yield of ethanol, 68.9 mol g -1 h -1 , was obtained by the sample synthesized using the lowest surfactant concentration and shortest synthesis time, representing a 258 improvement in photocatalytic efficiency.Overall, the addition of PVP enhanced the photocatalytic performance of the samples, largely due to changes in morphology and surface area.These results indicate that producing Bi 2 WO 6 catalysts with added PVP can enhance their photoactivity for CO 2 photoreduction.
