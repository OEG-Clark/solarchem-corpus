NH2-UiO-66 was synthesized by a previously reported procedure with slight modifications. 48ZrCl4 (1.029 mmol) and 2aminoterephthalic acid (H2ATA) (1.029 mmol) were dissolved in anhydrous DMF (60 mL), then deionized water (0.15 mL) was added to the solution.The mixture was transferred to a 100 ml Teflonlined stainless-steel autoclave and heated in an oven at 393 K for 24 h under autogenous pressure.After the reaction, the prepared products were washed with DMF and methanol, then dried at 343 K for 24 h. The CdS/NH2-UiO-66 hybrid membrane were prepared by using the casting and solvent evaporation technique.2 wt solution of chitosan (5 mL) was prepared by using 0.2 M aqueous acetic acid.And a certain amount of NH2-UiO-66 and CdS powder was dissolving a 3 mL of deionized water solution (theoretical mass ratio from 0.625:1 to 2.4:1 of CdS to NH2-UiO-66), respectively, and stirring thoroughly.And the mixture of NH2-UiO-66 and CdS powder was added into the 2 wt solution of chitosan under magnetic stirring and stirring for another 5 h.Then the dispersion was cast onto the plastic Petri dish and evaporated for 48 h at 323 K in a ventilated oven, and the obtained membranes were slowly cooled down to ambient temperature in the oven.Finally, CdS/NH2-UiO-66 hybrid membrane was removed from the dish and stored in desiccators before characterization.Moreover, the NH2-UiO-66 membrane and CdS membrane were obtained by similar methods. PXRD measurements of the as-prepared samples were conducted using a Miniflex 600 under CuK radiation ( 1.5406).The asprepared samples were characterized by a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-2600), and BaSO4 was used as the background.The morphology of the CdS/NH2-UiO-66 membranes were characterized using field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JSM6700).The metal contents of the sample were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS, ULTIMA 2).The photocurrent and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of samples were performed on an IM6ex (Zahner, Germany).The photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded on a FLS920 instrument.The metal contents of the sample were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS, ULTIMA 2). Photocatalytic experiments were carried out in a custom-made glass (200 mL), fitted with a quartz window.Before the photocatalytic reduction of CO2, 16.5 mg of CdS/NH2-UiO-66 membranes were treated under vacuum at 383 K to remove any solvent.Then, a hybrid membranewas then placed in the photocatalytic reactor with a mixture of acetonitrile (9 mL), H2O (6 mL) and TEOA (3 mL) that was exchanged with high purity CO2 (1 atm).The reaction system also contained 10 mg of bipyridine.A 300 W xenon arc lamp, with a cut off filter of wavelength between 400-760 nm, was used as the light source of the photocatalytic reaction.After irradiating for 6 h, the gases produced were detected and quantified by an Agilent 7820A gas chromatography (GC).The amount of HCOOH was detected by an ion chromatograph (Metrohm 883) and compact autosampler (Metrohm 863)."}, {"llm generation": "Visible light", "source": "Under visible light irradiation, 521.9 mol/g of CO was detected after 6 h irradiation, and trace HCOOH and H2 also appeared in the system (Fig. 8).", "context": "The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the CdS/NH2-UiO-66 membranes are shown in Fig. 1.CdS powder (Fig. 1a) and NH2-UiO-66 powder (Fig. 1b) exhibit the patterns similar to that of the published pattern. 47,48The diffraction peaks of the CdS/NH2-UiO-66 membrane (Fig. 1c) shows characteristic peaks of pure CdS powder and NH2-UiO-66 powder.In addition, the peak at 22.5 also appeared in the hybrid membrane, which match well with the chitosan membrane (Fig. 1d).No other peaks appears in the patterns, which indicates that the membrane material only contains CdS and NH2-UiO-66. The SEM images show that the as-prepared CdS sample was composed of nanorods.The length of the individual nanorod was 100-150 nm with uniform diameters of 20-40 nm (Fig. 2a).The Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins morphology of NH2-UiO-66 crystals were octahedral with the size of 100-150 nm (Fig. 2b).The morphology of the CdS/NH2-UiO-66 membrane is shown in Fig. 2c-2f.These CdS and NH2-UiO-66 particles were all well-distributed in membrane without large aggregates, which is also attested by the elemental mapping images of CdS/NH2-UiO-66 membrane (Fig. 2g and2h), suggesting that the presence and uniform distribution of the elements Cd and Zr.Therefore, they can provide larger interfacial areas at the fillerspolymer boundary and allow closer integration. The UV-vis absorption spectra of the catalysts are shown in Fig. S1, and the reflectance data were converted into absorbance using the Kubelk-Munk function (K-M). 49Fig.S1 shows that CdS membrane and NH2-UiO-66 membrane had good adsorption under visible light.Compared to CdS powder, there was no obvious shift for the absorption spectra of CdS membrane.Additionally, it can be seen that CdS/NH2-UiO-66 hybrid membrane can well respond to visible light of wavelength over than 400 nm, which suggests that the hybrid membrane will display excellent photocatalytic performance in the visible range and photo-excited electrons can efficiently transfer to the active sites. The adsorption capacity for CO2 plays important roles in the photocatalytic reduction of CO2.The as-prepared samples were analyzed via CO2 adsorption isotherm techniques.Compared to pure CdS powder, a significant improvement in the CO2 adsorption for CdS/NH2-UiO-66 mixed powder was observed at a very low pressure (Fig. S2 ) due to the adsorption ability of NH2-UiO-66 powder.What's more, the CdS/NH2-UiO-66/chitosan mixed powder had a higher CO2 adsorption (37.7 m 3 g -1 ) than that of CdS/NH2-UiO-66 powder (28.1 m 3 g -1 ), suggesting the chitosan plays the vital role on the enhanced the CO2 adsorption. In order to study the photo-reduction behavior of catalysts in the visible range, the photocatalytic activity was explored under mild environmental conditions.As shown in Fig. 3, the main product detected from the CdS/NH2-UiO-66 membrane system was CO (521.9 mol/g) after 6 h irradiation.However, only 188.29 and 127.52 mol/g CO was produced by the CdS membrane (Fig. 3a) and NH2-UiO-66 membrane (Fig. 3b), respectively.As expected, the photocatalytic conversion of CO2 was enhanced because ofthe combination of CdS and NH2-UiO-66 in membrane, suggesting that the formation of CdS/NH2-UiO-66 membrane can increase the adsorption of CO2.Besides, trace HCOOH and H2 also appeared in the system, and the selectivity of CO obtained in the CdS/NH2-UiO-66 membrane (99) was higher than the CdS membrane (97), which illustrates that CdS/NH2-UiO-66 membranes may suppress undesired reactions and increase product selectivity. For comparison, the photocatalytic activity of a mechanical mixture of CdS, NH2-UiO-66 and chitosan powders (with the same mass of CdS/NH2-UiO-66 membrane) under the same conditions was investigated.Fig. 3c shows that the photocatalysic activity of CdS/NH2-UiO-66/chitosan (313.2 mol/g) mixed powder was obviously lower than hybrid membrane, and the selectivity of CO conversion is only 95.1.This further illustrates that the formation of membrane is beneficial to the improvement of activity.Therefore, compared to CdS membrane, NH2-UiO-66 membrane and CdS/NH2-UiO-66/chitosan mixed powder, the CdS/NH2-UiO-66 membrane showed a excellent photocatalysic activity not only in the product yield of CO, but also in the selectivity of CO.As expected, the photocatalytic conversion of CO2 was enhanced due This journal is The Royal Society of Chemistry 20xx Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins to the formation of CdS/NH2-UiO-66 membrane.The photocatalytic activity of the hybrid membrane is listed with those of other photocatalysts reported in the literature (Table S1).Compared to the literature reports, 48,50515253545556575859606162 CdS/NH2-UiO-66 membrane has a higher photocatalytic activity, which is ascribed to the improvement of CO2 adsorption, the inhibition of electron-hole recombination and the optimization of CdS photocorrosion.However, it is worth pointing out that the selectivity of CO conversion in the CdS/NH2-UiO-66 membrane (99) was higher than those reported catalysts in the literature.In our work, the photocatalytic performance can be further demonstrated by the following transient photocurrent responses, the fluorescence spectroscopy (PL) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy was measured in order to analyse the electron-hole pairs recombination for CdS/NH2-UiO-66 membrane (Fig. 4a).It is generally believed that a higher fluorescence intensity illustrates more recombination of electronhole pairs and lower photocatalytic activities. 63As shown in Fig. 4a, the PL spectral intensity of hybrid membrane under photoexcitation at 318 nm was lower than that of pure CdSmembrane and NH2-UiO-66 membrane at the similar emission position, suggesting that the hybrid membrane had a much lower recombination rate of photo-generated charge carriers and a higher separation efficiency.In general, the reaction rate on theelectrode surface is related to the arc radiusof the Nyquist plots. 64,65The arc radius, the faster the interface charge transfer.As shown in Fig. 4b, the arc radius of the EIS Nyquist plot of CdS/NH2-UiO-66 membrane is smaller than that of pure CdS membrane and NH2-UiO-66 membrane, suggesting that a faster interfacial charge transfer occurred on the membrane, which results in a more effective separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs.Thereby the better activity of the photocatalytic reaction was finally obtained in the CdS/NH2-UiO-66 membrane.Moreover, the acceleration of electron transfer in the CdS/NH2-UiO-66 membrane can also be reflected in the photocurrent measurement.A photocurrent was eventually obtained when the photogenerated electron-hole pairs are effectively separated.The electrons diffuse to the back contact, and the photoinduced holes are effectively to the back contact, and the photoinduced holes are effectively to the back contact, and the photoinduced holes are effectively taken up by the hole acceptor in the electrolyte. 29Therefore, the faster the electron transfers, the greater the photocurrent.Fig. 4c illustrates that Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins CdS/NH2-UiO-66 membrane coated on the FTO glass has higher photocurrent response than single CdS membrane or NH2-UiO-66 membrane under light irradiation, indicating that more electronhole pairs were excited and photoexcited electrons can efficiently transfer to the active sites.Thus, the photocatalytic reduction activity of CO2 in the system is substantially improved. Upon light irradiation, electron-hole pairs were excited and generated on the CdS and NH2-UiO-66.Photoinduced electrons were separated and migrated to the active sites of CdS and NH2-UiO-66, respectively, which explains that CdS and NH2-UiO-66 were conductive in the system.Therefore, compared to single CdS membrane and NH2-UiO-66 membrane, the hybrid membrane has a higher photocurrent, smaller electrical resistance and lower fluorescence intensity due to the excellent superposition activity of CdS or NH2-UiO-66 in the hybrid membrane.Finally, the photocatalytic activity of the hybrid membrane is higher than pure CdS and NH2-UiO-66 membrane.The SEM images of CdS/NH2-UiO-66 mixed powder were also shown in Fig. S3.A low magnification SEM image shows that the CdS and NH2-UiO-66 particles were not well distributed in the CdS/NH2-UiO-66 mixed powder (Fig. S3a).And a high magnification SEM image (Fig. S3b) reveals that CdS and NH2-UiO-66 has a strong tendency to agglomerate, which will decrease the photocatalytic activity.Therefore, the formation of the hybrid membrane is beneficial for the improvement of photocatalytic activity. In order to further prove the enhanced activity in the CdS/NH2-UiO-66 membrane, the EIS and photocurrents of a mechanical mix-Fig.6.The effect of the quality of CdS and NH2-UiO-66 on the evolution of CO from the chemical system.Reaction conditions: solvent -18 mL, MeCN : H2O: TEOA 3:2:1; bpy: 10mg; CO2-1 atm; 760 nm 400 nm; room temperature; 6 h.ture of CdS and NH2-UiO-66 powders were also investigated.As shown in Fig. 5a, compared with CdS/NH2-UiO-66 physical mixed powders, the arc radius of the EIS Nyquist plot of the CdS/NH2-UiO-66 membrane is smaller, suggesting that the internal structure of the hybrid membrane be more favorable to the interfacial charge transfer.Thus, the recombination of electron-hole in hybrid membrane was inhibited and the separation efficiency of the excited electron-hole pairs increased.In order to further prove the improvement in separation efficiency, the transient photocurrent responses of the photocatalysts are performed in Fig. 5b.The photocurrent response intensity of the CdS/NH2-UiO-66 composite membrane was higher than physical mixed powders, suggesting that the photoexcited electrons can efficiently transfer to the active sites.Therefore, the CdS/NH2-UiO-66 membrane had a higher photocatalytic activity for the CO2 reduction reaction than their mixed powder.In addition, the intensity of photocurrent response in the CdS/NH2-UiO-66 membrane is more stable than physical powder.However, as time increased, the photocurrent intensity of CdS and NH2-UiO-66 physical mixed powder decreased, which This journal is The Royal Society of Chemistry 20xx Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins indicated that the electron transfer rate becomes slower because of CdS photocorrosion.Fig. 5b also shows The intensity of photocurrent response in the CdS/NH2-UiO-66 membrane is more stable than physical powders.Therefore, the hybrid membrane is conducive to the stability of the photocatalytic reaction. The participation of CO2 in the reaction was investigated by replacing CO2 with N2.Fig. S4 showed no CO2 was reduced under identical conditions after 6 h, suggesting the photocatalytic reduction production of CO was from pure CO2 and not from NH2-UiO-66 or other organic compounds. For the CO2 photocatalytsis reduction reaction, the reaction parameters such as the added amount of catalyst, the type of solvent in the reaction system are crucial to the improvement of the reaction activity. 8Fig. 6 showed the effect of the adding amount of CdS and NH2-UiO-66 on the catalytic activity of CdS/NH2-UiO-66 membrane.As can be seen, the yield value of CO continued to improve with the increase of CdS amount, and the maximum value of 50.4 mol/g was obtained when 4 mg CdS was included in the system.However, when the amount of CdS was further increased, a lower photocatalytic activity was finally received.Because the CdS nanorods will agglomerate together with the increase in the number of CdS.In addition, the high cocatalytic efficiency of NH2-UiO-66 was also reflected in Fig. 6b.The highest yields were obtained with the 2.5 mg of the NH2-UiO-66 loading, and these excellent performances are attributed to the synergistic effect between the CdS particles and NH2-UiO-66.When a further raise appeared in the amount of NH2-UiO-66, the photocatalytic activity decreased, which might result from the agglomeration of particles occurring on CdS/NH2-UiO-66 membrane with the further addition of NH2-UiO-66 particles. Water plays an important role in the CO2 photocatalysis reduction reaction. 66Fig. 7ashows that a lower activity was finally obtained when no water presented in the reaction system, however, once 6mL of water was added to the system, more than 15 times enhancement in the production of CO was achieved as compared with the water-free system.Meanwhile, a selectivity of CO formation with a maximum value of 99 was acquired.If the volume of water was further increased, the evolution of CO was gradually reduced because of the competitive relationship between hydrogen and carbon monoxide production.What's more, TEOA is known as a \"magic\" sacrificial electron donor, which can enhance the turnover number and the selectivity of CO formation.Fig. 7b indicates that the gas evolution increased as the amount of TEOA increased, and 3 mL of TEOA was the most appropriated for the system.When the volume of TEOA was further increased, the amount of CO generated was markedly decreased, because the migration of electrons was restricted in high viscosity TEOA solution.During this process, the amount of HCOOH continued to enhance,which indicated that TEOA might also play a role as a proton source in the present photo-catalytic reaction of CdS/NH2-UiO-66 membrane.Apparently, TEOA can facilitate the photocatalytic CO2 reduction because of its more basic nature. Besides, the effect of bipyridine (bpy) was investigated in the photocatalytic reduction system (Fig. 7c).When 10 mg of bpy was added to the system, the production of CO increased significantly, which is approximately 2.3 times more than that produced in bpyfree system.Therefore, the photocatalytic conversion of CO2 was enhanced due to the introduction of bpy.EIS and transient photocurrent responses of samples were also tested to further illuminate of the performance of bpy (Fig. S5) When bpy was added to the reaction solution, the arc radius of the EIS Nyquist plot was smaller (Fig S5a ), indicating that the electron-hole recombination of Fig. 7.The production of CO, H2, HCOOH as a function of solvent added to the reaction system.The solvents are H2O, TEOA and bpy, respectively.Reaction conditions: 760 nm 400 nm; room temperature; 6 h. Please do not adjust margins the composites was inhibited and the separation efficiency of the excited electron-hole pairs increased.Fig. S5b shows that the intensity of the photocurrent response was enhanced obviously due to the introduction of bpy, which suggested that the photoexcited electrons can efficiently transfer to the active sites. The catalytic performance of the CdS/NH2-UiO-66 membrane photocatalyzed CO2 reduction system was evaluated in an optimiz-Fig.8. Time-production plot of CO over irradiated CdS/NH2-UiO-66 membrane.Reaction conditions: solvent -18 mL, MeCN : H2O: TEOA 3:2:1; bpy: 10mg; CO2-1 atm; 760 nm 400 nm; room temperature; 6 h.ed reaction condition.Fig. 8 shows that the accumulation of CO in the system was gradually increasing with time.The reaction rate may be related to the concentration of CO2 in the system.It takes time for the CdS/NH2-UiO-66 hybrid membrane to absorb CO2 to the active sites.Therefore, when the amount of CO2 in the CdS/NH2-UiO-66 hybrid membrane accumulate for a period of time, the production rate of CO increases obviously.Under visible light irradiation, 521.9 mol/g of CO was detected after 6 h irradiation, and trace HCOOH and H2 also appeared in the system (Fig. 8).Therefore, a excellent activity of photocatalytic reduction CO2 was obtained in CdS/NH2-UiO-66 hybrid membrane reactors. The CdS/NH2-UiO-66 membrane was stable in the photocatalytic reduction reaction.The cycling results showed that there was no obvious loss of the photocatalytic activity over the membrane catalyst after three runs reaction (Fig. 9).Fig. S6 also showed that CdS/NH2-UiO-66 membrane was stable during the photocatalytic reaction as confirmed from the similar XRD patterns between the fresh and used photocatalysts.In order to further prove the stability of the hybrid membrane, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was used to confirm the loss of CdS and NH2-UiO-66 after the photocatalytic reduction reaction.After 6 h irradiation under visible light, the CdS/NH2-UiO-66 membrane was removed from the reactor and the rest of the reaction solution was transferred to the beaker for testing on the ICP-MS instrument.The result shows that the percentage of Cd and Zr in the reaction solution was 0.2 and 1.8, respectively.The trace loss of CdS or NH2-UiO-66 is negligible compared to the hybrid membrane. Therefore, the CdS/NH2-UiO-66 membrane is stable, which is advantageous for the improvement of photocatalytic activity. Based on the above test results and analysis, a possible reaction mechanism for the CO2 photocatalytic reduction system was proposed.Under visible light irradiation, electron-hole pairs were excited and generated on both CdS and NH2-UiO-66.Then photoinduced electrons readily transferred to the surface of CdS and NH2-UiO-66 and subsequently interacted with the CO2 molecule, which effectively enhance the separation of photo-generated electron-hole pairs.The CdS/NH2-UiO-66 hybrid membrane exhibits superior photocatalytic performance than CdS/NH2-UiO-66 mixed powder catalysts.The reasons are as follows: (a) The chitosan of the hybrid membrane has abundant amino and hydroxyl groups, which can improve the adsorption of CO2 molecules.(b) According to the above data analysis of EIS and photocurrent measurements, the hybrid membrane has smaller impedance and greater photocurrent.This suggests that the hybrid membrane reactor can accelerate electron transfer and better inhibit recombination of electron-hole pairs.(c) The photocurrent measurements demonstrated that the CdS photocorrosion of hybrid membranes is inhibited, which results in the improved activity.As expected, the activity of photocatalytic reduction CO2 in the membrane system was substantiallyenhanced."}], "lamp": [{"llm generation": "Xenon", "source": "A 300 W xenon arc lamp, with a cut off filter of wavelength between 400-760 nm, was used as the light source of the photocatalytic reaction.", "context": "All reagents were analytical grade and used without further purification.CdS nanorods were obtained according to a previously reported method. 47In this typical method, 2 mmol cadmium acetate Cd(Ac)22H2O and 4 mmol L-cysteine (C3H7NO2S) were added into a 100 mL Teflonlined autoclave which was filled with 50 mL tetraethylenepentamine (TEPA) as solvent.Then the autoclave was sealed and heated in an oven at 453 K for 24 h under autogenous pressure.After the autoclave cooled to room temperature naturally, the acquired precipitates were washed with deionized water and alcohol several times.

The SEM images show that the as-prepared CdS sample was composed of nanorods.The length of the individual nanorod was 100-150 nm with uniform diameters of 20-40 nm (Fig. 2a).The Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins morphology of NH2-UiO-66 crystals were octahedral with the size of 100-150 nm (Fig. 2b).The morphology of the CdS/NH2-UiO-66 membrane is shown in Fig. 2c-2f.These CdS and NH2-UiO-66 particles were all well-distributed in membrane without large aggregates, which is also attested by the elemental mapping images of CdS/NH2-UiO-66 membrane (Fig. 2g and2h), suggesting that the presence and uniform distribution of the elements Cd and Zr.Therefore, they can provide larger interfacial areas at the fillerspolymer boundary and allow closer integration. The UV-vis absorption spectra of the catalysts are shown in Fig. S1, and the reflectance data were converted into absorbance using the Kubelk-Munk function (K-M). 49Fig.S1 shows that CdS membrane and NH2-UiO-66 membrane had good adsorption under visible light.Compared to CdS powder, there was no obvious shift for the absorption spectra of CdS membrane.Additionally, it can be seen that CdS/NH2-UiO-66 hybrid membrane can well respond to visible light of wavelength over than 400 nm, which suggests that the hybrid membrane will display excellent photocatalytic performance in the visible range and photo-excited electrons can efficiently transfer to the active sites. The adsorption capacity for CO2 plays important roles in the photocatalytic reduction of CO2.The as-prepared samples were analyzed via CO2 adsorption isotherm techniques.Compared to pure CdS powder, a significant improvement in the CO2 adsorption for CdS/NH2-UiO-66 mixed powder was observed at a very low pressure (Fig. S2 ) due to the adsorption ability of NH2-UiO-66 powder.What's more, the CdS/NH2-UiO-66/chitosan mixed powder had a higher CO2 adsorption (37.7 m 3 g -1 ) than that of CdS/NH2-UiO-66 powder (28.1 m 3 g -1 ), suggesting the chitosan plays the vital role on the enhanced the CO2 adsorption. In order to study the photo-reduction behavior of catalysts in the visible range, the photocatalytic activity was explored under mild environmental conditions.As shown in Fig. 3, the main product detected from the CdS/NH2-UiO-66 membrane system was CO (521.9 mol/g) after 6 h irradiation.However, only 188.29 and 127.52 mol/g CO was produced by the CdS membrane (Fig. 3a) and NH2-UiO-66 membrane (Fig. 3b), respectively.As expected, the photocatalytic conversion of CO2 was enhanced because ofthe combination of CdS and NH2-UiO-66 in membrane, suggesting that the formation of CdS/NH2-UiO-66 membrane can increase the adsorption of CO2.Besides, trace HCOOH and H2 also appeared in the system, and the selectivity of CO obtained in the CdS/NH2-UiO-66 membrane (99) was higher than the CdS membrane (97), which illustrates that CdS/NH2-UiO-66 membranes may suppress undesired reactions and increase product selectivity. For comparison, the photocatalytic activity of a mechanical mixture of CdS, NH2-UiO-66 and chitosan powders (with the same mass of CdS/NH2-UiO-66 membrane) under the same conditions was investigated.Fig. 3c shows that the photocatalysic activity of CdS/NH2-UiO-66/chitosan (313.2 mol/g) mixed powder was obviously lower than hybrid membrane, and the selectivity of CO conversion is only 95.1.This further illustrates that the formation of membrane is beneficial to the improvement of activity.Therefore, compared to CdS membrane, NH2-UiO-66 membrane and CdS/NH2-UiO-66/chitosan mixed powder, the CdS/NH2-UiO-66 membrane showed a excellent photocatalysic activity not only in the product yield of CO, but also in the selectivity of CO.As expected, the photocatalytic conversion of CO2 was enhanced due This journal is The Royal Society of Chemistry 20xx Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins to the formation of CdS/NH2-UiO-66 membrane.The photocatalytic activity of the hybrid membrane is listed with those of other photocatalysts reported in the literature (Table S1).Compared to the literature reports, 48,50515253545556575859606162 CdS/NH2-UiO-66 membrane has a higher photocatalytic activity, which is ascribed to the improvement of CO2 adsorption, the inhibition of electron-hole recombination and the optimization of CdS photocorrosion.However, it is worth pointing out that the selectivity of CO conversion in the CdS/NH2-UiO-66 membrane (99) was higher than those reported catalysts in the literature.In our work, the photocatalytic performance can be further demonstrated by the following transient photocurrent responses, the fluorescence spectroscopy (PL) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy was measured in order to analyse the electron-hole pairs recombination for CdS/NH2-UiO-66 membrane (Fig. 4a).It is generally believed that a higher fluorescence intensity illustrates more recombination of electronhole pairs and lower photocatalytic activities. 63As shown in Fig. 4a, the PL spectral intensity of hybrid membrane under photoexcitation at 318 nm was lower than that of pure CdSmembrane and NH2-UiO-66 membrane at the similar emission position, suggesting that the hybrid membrane had a much lower recombination rate of photo-generated charge carriers and a higher separation efficiency.In general, the reaction rate on theelectrode surface is related to the arc radiusof the Nyquist plots. 64,65The arc radius, the faster the interface charge transfer.As shown in Fig. 4b, the arc radius of the EIS Nyquist plot of CdS/NH2-UiO-66 membrane is smaller than that of pure CdS membrane and NH2-UiO-66 membrane, suggesting that a faster interfacial charge transfer occurred on the membrane, which results in a more effective separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs.Thereby the better activity of the photocatalytic reaction was finally obtained in the CdS/NH2-UiO-66 membrane.Moreover, the acceleration of electron transfer in the CdS/NH2-UiO-66 membrane can also be reflected in the photocurrent measurement.A photocurrent was eventually obtained when the photogenerated electron-hole pairs are effectively separated.The electrons diffuse to the back contact, and the photoinduced holes are effectively to the back contact, and the photoinduced holes are effectively to the back contact, and the photoinduced holes are effectively taken up by the hole acceptor in the electrolyte. 29Therefore, the faster the electron transfers, the greater the photocurrent.Fig. 4c illustrates that Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins CdS/NH2-UiO-66 membrane coated on the FTO glass has higher photocurrent response than single CdS membrane or NH2-UiO-66 membrane under light irradiation, indicating that more electronhole pairs were excited and photoexcited electrons can efficiently transfer to the active sites.Thus, the photocatalytic reduction activity of CO2 in the system is substantially improved. Upon light irradiation, electron-hole pairs were excited and generated on the CdS and NH2-UiO-66.Photoinduced electrons were separated and migrated to the active sites of CdS and NH2-UiO-66, respectively, which explains that CdS and NH2-UiO-66 were conductive in the system.Therefore, compared to single CdS membrane and NH2-UiO-66 membrane, the hybrid membrane has a higher photocurrent, smaller electrical resistance and lower fluorescence intensity due to the excellent superposition activity of CdS or NH2-UiO-66 in the hybrid membrane.Finally, the photocatalytic activity of the hybrid membrane is higher than pure CdS and NH2-UiO-66 membrane.The SEM images of CdS/NH2-UiO-66 mixed powder were also shown in Fig. S3.A low magnification SEM image shows that the CdS and NH2-UiO-66 particles were not well distributed in the CdS/NH2-UiO-66 mixed powder (Fig. S3a).And a high magnification SEM image (Fig. S3b) reveals that CdS and NH2-UiO-66 has a strong tendency to agglomerate, which will decrease the photocatalytic activity.Therefore, the formation of the hybrid membrane is beneficial for the improvement of photocatalytic activity. In order to further prove the enhanced activity in the CdS/NH2-UiO-66 membrane, the EIS and photocurrents of a mechanical mix-Fig.6.The effect of the quality of CdS and NH2-UiO-66 on the evolution of CO from the chemical system.Reaction conditions: solvent -18 mL, MeCN : H2O: TEOA 3:2:1; bpy: 10mg; CO2-1 atm; 760 nm 400 nm; room temperature; 6 h.ture of CdS and NH2-UiO-66 powders were also investigated.As shown in Fig. 5a, compared with CdS/NH2-UiO-66 physical mixed powders, the arc radius of the EIS Nyquist plot of the CdS/NH2-UiO-66 membrane is smaller, suggesting that the internal structure of the hybrid membrane be more favorable to the interfacial charge transfer.Thus, the recombination of electron-hole in hybrid membrane was inhibited and the separation efficiency of the excited electron-hole pairs increased.In order to further prove the improvement in separation efficiency, the transient photocurrent responses of the photocatalysts are performed in Fig. 5b.The photocurrent response intensity of the CdS/NH2-UiO-66 composite membrane was higher than physical mixed powders, suggesting that the photoexcited electrons can efficiently transfer to the active sites.Therefore, the CdS/NH2-UiO-66 membrane had a higher photocatalytic activity for the CO2 reduction reaction than their mixed powder.In addition, the intensity of photocurrent response in the CdS/NH2-UiO-66 membrane is more stable than physical powder.However, as time increased, the photocurrent intensity of CdS and NH2-UiO-66 physical mixed powder decreased, which This journal is The Royal Society of Chemistry 20xx Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins indicated that the electron transfer rate becomes slower because of CdS photocorrosion.Fig. 5b also shows The intensity of photocurrent response in the CdS/NH2-UiO-66 membrane is more stable than physical powders.Therefore, the hybrid membrane is conducive to the stability of the photocatalytic reaction. The participation of CO2 in the reaction was investigated by replacing CO2 with N2.Fig. S4 showed no CO2 was reduced under identical conditions after 6 h, suggesting the photocatalytic reduction production of CO was from pure CO2 and not from NH2-UiO-66 or other organic compounds. For the CO2 photocatalytsis reduction reaction, the reaction parameters such as the added amount of catalyst, the type of solvent in the reaction system are crucial to the improvement of the reaction activity. 8Fig. 6 showed the effect of the adding amount of CdS and NH2-UiO-66 on the catalytic activity of CdS/NH2-UiO-66 membrane.As can be seen, the yield value of CO continued to improve with the increase of CdS amount, and the maximum value of 50.4 mol/g was obtained when 4 mg CdS was included in the system.However, when the amount of CdS was further increased, a lower photocatalytic activity was finally received.Because the CdS nanorods will agglomerate together with the increase in the number of CdS.In addition, the high cocatalytic efficiency of NH2-UiO-66 was also reflected in Fig. 6b.The highest yields were obtained with the 2.5 mg of the NH2-UiO-66 loading, and these excellent performances are attributed to the synergistic effect between the CdS particles and NH2-UiO-66.When a further raise appeared in the amount of NH2-UiO-66, the photocatalytic activity decreased, which might result from the agglomeration of particles occurring on CdS/NH2-UiO-66 membrane with the further addition of NH2-UiO-66 particles. Water plays an important role in the CO2 photocatalysis reduction reaction. 66Fig. 7ashows that a lower activity was finally obtained when no water presented in the reaction system, however, once 6mL of water was added to the system, more than 15 times enhancement in the production of CO was achieved as compared with the water-free system.Meanwhile, a selectivity of CO formation with a maximum value of 99 was acquired.If the volume of water was further increased, the evolution of CO was gradually reduced because of the competitive relationship between hydrogen and carbon monoxide production.What's more, TEOA is known as a \"magic\" sacrificial electron donor, which can enhance the turnover number and the selectivity of CO formation.Fig. 7b indicates that the gas evolution increased as the amount of TEOA increased, and 3 mL of TEOA was the most appropriated for the system.When the volume of TEOA was further increased, the amount of CO generated was markedly decreased, because the migration of electrons was restricted in high viscosity TEOA solution.During this process, the amount of HCOOH continued to enhance,which indicated that TEOA might also play a role as a proton source in the present photo-catalytic reaction of CdS/NH2-UiO-66 membrane.Apparently, TEOA can facilitate the photocatalytic CO2 reduction because of its more basic nature. Besides, the effect of bipyridine (bpy) was investigated in the photocatalytic reduction system (Fig. 7c).When 10 mg of bpy was added to the system, the production of CO increased significantly, which is approximately 2.3 times more than that produced in bpyfree system.Therefore, the photocatalytic conversion of CO2 was enhanced due to the introduction of bpy.EIS and transient photocurrent responses of samples were also tested to further illuminate of the performance of bpy (Fig. S5) When bpy was added to the reaction solution, the arc radius of the EIS Nyquist plot was smaller (Fig S5a ), indicating that the electron-hole recombination of Fig. 7.The production of CO, H2, HCOOH as a function of solvent added to the reaction system.The solvents are H2O, TEOA and bpy, respectively.Reaction conditions: 760 nm 400 nm; room temperature; 6 h. Please do not adjust margins the composites was inhibited and the separation efficiency of the excited electron-hole pairs increased.Fig. S5b shows that the intensity of the photocurrent response was enhanced obviously due to the introduction of bpy, which suggested that the photoexcited electrons can efficiently transfer to the active sites. The catalytic performance of the CdS/NH2-UiO-66 membrane photocatalyzed CO2 reduction system was evaluated in an optimiz-Fig.8. Time-production plot of CO over irradiated CdS/NH2-UiO-66 membrane.Reaction conditions: solvent -18 mL, MeCN : H2O: TEOA 3:2:1; bpy: 10mg; CO2-1 atm; 760 nm 400 nm; room temperature; 6 h.ed reaction condition.Fig. 8 shows that the accumulation of CO in the system was gradually increasing with time.The reaction rate may be related to the concentration of CO2 in the system.It takes time for the CdS/NH2-UiO-66 hybrid membrane to absorb CO2 to the active sites.Therefore, when the amount of CO2 in the CdS/NH2-UiO-66 hybrid membrane accumulate for a period of time, the production rate of CO increases obviously.Under visible light irradiation, 521.9 mol/g of CO was detected after 6 h irradiation, and trace HCOOH and H2 also appeared in the system (Fig. 8).Therefore, a excellent activity of photocatalytic reduction CO2 was obtained in CdS/NH2-UiO-66 hybrid membrane reactors. The CdS/NH2-UiO-66 membrane was stable in the photocatalytic reduction reaction.The cycling results showed that there was no obvious loss of the photocatalytic activity over the membrane catalyst after three runs reaction (Fig. 9).Fig. S6 also showed that CdS/NH2-UiO-66 membrane was stable during the photocatalytic reaction as confirmed from the similar XRD patterns between the fresh and used photocatalysts.In order to further prove the stability of the hybrid membrane, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was used to confirm the loss of CdS and NH2-UiO-66 after the photocatalytic reduction reaction.After 6 h irradiation under visible light, the CdS/NH2-UiO-66 membrane was removed from the reactor and the rest of the reaction solution was transferred to the beaker for testing on the ICP-MS instrument.The result shows that the percentage of Cd and Zr in the reaction solution was 0.2 and 1.8, respectively.The trace loss of CdS or NH2-UiO-66 is negligible compared to the hybrid membrane. Therefore, the CdS/NH2-UiO-66 membrane is stable, which is advantageous for the improvement of photocatalytic activity. Based on the above test results and analysis, a possible reaction mechanism for the CO2 photocatalytic reduction system was proposed.Under visible light irradiation, electron-hole pairs were excited and generated on both CdS and NH2-UiO-66.Then photoinduced electrons readily transferred to the surface of CdS and NH2-UiO-66 and subsequently interacted with the CO2 molecule, which effectively enhance the separation of photo-generated electron-hole pairs.The CdS/NH2-UiO-66 hybrid membrane exhibits superior photocatalytic performance than CdS/NH2-UiO-66 mixed powder catalysts.The reasons are as follows: (a) The chitosan of the hybrid membrane has abundant amino and hydroxyl groups, which can improve the adsorption of CO2 molecules.(b) According to the above data analysis of EIS and photocurrent measurements, the hybrid membrane has smaller impedance and greater photocurrent.This suggests that the hybrid membrane reactor can accelerate electron transfer and better inhibit recombination of electron-hole pairs.(c) The photocurrent measurements demonstrated that the CdS photocorrosion of hybrid membranes is inhibited, which results in the improved activity.As expected, the activity of photocatalytic reduction CO2 in the membrane system was substantiallyenhanced."}, {"llm generation": "Liquid", "source": "Reaction conditions: solvent -18 mL, MeCN : H2O: TEOA 3:2:1; bpy: 10mg; CO2-1 atm; 760 nm 400 nm; room temperature; 6 h.", "context": "Detailed studies were performed on photocatalytic reduction CO2 evolution on CdS/NH2-UiO-66 membrane.In this work, CdS/NH2-UiO-66 hybrid membrane were prepared with chitosan as a carrier by using the casting and solvent evaporation technique.The semiconductor/MOFs hybrid membrane shows a excellent photocatalytic activity than CdS membrane, NH2-UiO-66 membrane, and CdS/NH2-UiO-66/chitosan mixed powder, which is attributed to the higher absorption of CO2.What's more, incorporating MOFs and semiconductor into membranes has exhibited an enhancement Fig.1.PXRD patterns, (a) CdS powder, (b) pure NH2-UiO-66 powder,(c) CdS/NH2-UiO-66 membrane and (d) chitosan membrane.
