Switch light at least 10 recycles."}, {"llm generation": "Liquid", "source": "The solution color change upon the light irradiation is attributed to the transformation between Ti IV and Ti III , electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra were employed to confirm the existence of Ti III under light irradiation (Fig. S12) 37.", "context": "NH 2 -MIL-125(Ti) samples with different morphologies and facets were achieved by regulating the volume ratio of solvent, the amount of modulator and reaction time (Fig. 1a).The recognition and definition of the facets are exhibited in Fig. S1, in contrast to the low-index facets, the high-index facets are generally represented by hkl Miller indices with a minimum requirement of at least one index greater than one.As shown in Fig. 1b, a well-defined truncated octahedron of NH 2 -MIL-125(Ti) was obtained, set as T000.With the addition of acetic acid (AA) as modulator, four new square facets 0 1 0 are formed at the corners of the truncated octahedron, which is named T010 (Fig. 1c).Additionally, with the reaction times increased to 72 h, eight small triangles of high-index 1 1 2 facets emerged at the corners of the truncated octahedron as illustrated in Fig. 1d, which is donated as T112.Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy mapping images of T000, T010 and T112 are shown in Fig. S2.Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns, high-resolution Xray photoelectron spectroscopy (HR-XPS) and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were employed to estimate the crystal phases, chemical state of surface atoms and functional groups for the assynthesized NH 2 -MIL-125(Ti).All PXRD diffraction patterns of these three samples show the same crystal structure with the calculated NH 2 -MIL-125(Ti) (Fig. 1e) 32, which is also supported by the FT-IR spectral data (Fig. S3).XPS survey spectra are provided in Fig. S4 to characterize the chemical composition and elemental chemical states of these three samples.Ti, O, N and C were detected, and the HR-XPS spectra of Ti 2p exhibit two peaks around 464.7 and 458.9 eV, which represent Ti 2p 1/2 and Ti 2p 3/2 of Ti IV for the Ti-oxo cluster (Ti-O x ) on the surface of NH 2 -MIL-125(Ti), respectively (Fig. 1f) 33.The above results indicate that the adjustment of facets in this synthetic system just changes the surface atomic exposure without altering the framework structure of NH 2 -MIL-125(Ti).Furthermore, it is noteworthy that more Ti-O x clusters are not only exposed on the 1 1 2 facets surface but also located in the inside channels compared with the 0 1 0 facets (Fig. S5).Therefore, T112 has the highest Ti atomic concentration as well as the stoichiometric ratio of Ti to ligand among these three samples (Table S1), suggesting that more active sites are exposed and more efficient photocatalytic activity can be expected for the sample T112. Considering the effect of electronic band structure on photocatalytic efficiency, UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) and Mott-Schottky plots were examined.As shown in Fig. 2a and Fig. S6, the NH 2 -MIL-125(Ti) exhibits a broad absorption region, and the wavelength of light absorption has an obvious red shift with high-index 1 1 2 exposed.T112 shows an enhanced optical absorption ability compared with the T000 and T010 as well as the bulky NH 2 -MIL-125(Ti) without facet tuning, demonstrating an increase of light absorption ability with exposing high-index 1 1 2 facets.The corresponding HOMO-LUMO gap is estimated based on the Tauc plots derived from the DRS and the gaps of as-synthesized NH 2 -MIL-125(Ti) are calculated to be 2.73, 2.63, 2.54 and 2.45 eV for bulky sample, T000, T010 and T112, respectively (Fig. S6 and Fig. 2b).T112 possesses the smallest HOMO-LUMO gap, which means the lowest energy barrier to overcome for electron excitation from HOMO to LUMO level.It was reported that the LUMO level is contributed by the Ti 3p orbitals and O 2p orbitals while the HOMO level is composed of the O 2p orbitals 34.Therefore, the regulation of facet could realize the modification and promotion of the NH 2 -MIL-125(Ti)'s electronic band structure.The Mott-Schottky plots were employed to get the edges of the HOMO-LUMO gap of T000, T010 and T112 since the NH 2 -MIL-125(Ti) is a typical n-type semiconductor (Fig. S7) 35.And the flat potentials were determined to be -0.71,-0.65 and -0.74 V vs NHE for T000, T010 and T112 (Fig. 2c), respectively.The LUMO level potentials of these three samples are all above the potentials of CO 2 -to-CO and CO 2 -to-CH 4 conversions, which imply that the electronic band structures of these samples satisfy the thermodynamic requirement for CO 2 -to-CO and CO 2 -to-CH 4 reduction.T112 with exposing high-index 1 1 2 facets possesses the highest energy level of LUMO minimum, which could generate more reduction electrons to participate in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction. After determining the facets and electronic band structures of three samples, photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activities were explored in the absence of additional photosensitizers.As shown in Fig. 3a, T112 exhibits superior photocatalytic activities with CO 2 -to-CO and CO 2 -to-CH 4 conversions, which are about 33 and 31 times higher than the yield of T000 with 0 0 1/1 1 1 facets, respectively (Table S2).The total apparent quantum yield (AQY) of T112 is 0.097 for the products of CO and CH 4 , while the corresponding value of T000 is far below the T112, only 0.003 (Table S3).And the effectiveness of photo-electrons is remarkably enhanced with exposing 1 1 2 facets on the surface of NH 2 -MIL-125(Ti).The effectiveness of photo-electrons of T112 is 100.46 mol g -1 h -1 , about 32 times higher than the one of T000 (3.13 mol g - 1 h -1 ) (Fig. 3c).While the CH 4 selectivity is comparable with value of 52.96, 53.47 and 51.24 for T000, T010 and T112, respectively.The products of CO and CH 4 were quantified by gas chromatography with a FID detector (Fig. S8).No liquid product was detected by 1 H NMR spectrum (Fig. S9).In addition, the control experiments with different reaction conditions were also carried out (Fig. 3b).No CO and/or CH 4 were detected under different conditions, like without TEOA, without photocatalyst, using N 2 to replace CO 2 and without light.The isotopic 13 CO 2 tracking experiment certificates that the carbon source of CO and CH 4 originated from the CO 2 gas (Fig. S10), confirming that the high photocatalytic activity is not derived from the decomposition of frameworks.In this photocatalytic system, TEOA was oxidized during the catalytic process (Fig. S11) 36.The solution color change upon the light irradiation is attributed to the transformation between Ti IV and Ti III , electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra were employed to confirm the existence of Ti III under light irradiation (Fig. S12) 37. T112 exhibits enhanced EPR signals compared with T000 and T010, indicating the enhanced charge transfer due to the high-index facets exposed.Moreover, the photocatalytic stability of T112 is confirmed after five recycles (Fig. 3d) of the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction experiments.The PXRD pattern (Fig. S13) and SEM images (Fig. S14) of the T112 sample after photocatalytic reactions have no obvious change compared with the fresh catalyst, indicating that the T112 possesses superior structure stability in the photocatalytic reaction. In general, photocatalytic activity could be affected by various factors such as CO 2 uptake capacity, electronic band structure and charge carriers transfer efficiency 38.Accordingly, N 2 and CO 2 adsorption isotherms of these three samples were studied (Figs.S15-S17).T112 possesses the largest Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface area of 1232.65 m 2 g -1 and the highest CO 2 uptakes of 131.66 and 66.83 cm 3 g -1 at 273 and 298 K, respectively.1 1 2 facets occupy only a small part of the surface area of the NH 2 -MIL-125 (Ti), but have major contribution to the CO 2 uptake since the sample with 1 1 2 facets has different surface chemistry of the internal structure as illustrated in Fig. S5.The adsorption enthalpy (Qst) was calculated by dual-site Langmuir modal according to the CO 2 uptake data of these samples (Figs.S18-S20) 39.T112 shows the largest adsorption enthalpy (35.69 kJ mol -1 ), confirming that the strongest affinity between CO 2 and catalyst 40.The specific surface area, CO 2 uptake and adsorption enthalpy of these samples are listed in Table S4.The larger specific surface can provide more adsorption and activation sites for CO 2 molecules.The higher CO 2 uptake and larger adsorption enthalpy demonstrate stronger affinity between CO 2 substrate and T112 with exposing high-index 1 1 2 facets.CO 2 adsorption is the first step to determine the activity in the CO 2 photocatalytic reaction. In addition, the separation and transfer of charge carriers is another key factor for CO 2 photoreduction.The steady-state photoluminescent (PL) and the time-resolved fluorescence decay experiments were measured to characterize photoelectronic properties.As shown in Fig. 4a, T000 shows a high PL intensity, indicating that the recombination of electron-hole pair.T112 exhibits a fast electron migration and separation efficiency with a low PL intensity.The obvious PL quenching reveals that the most rapid and efficient electron transfer occurs in T112 among these three NH 2 -MIL-125(Ti) samples.The photogeneration carrier dynamics of the samples were explored by the time-resolved fluorescence decay experiments (Fig. 4b), and the fitting spectra were given in Fig. S21.The average carrier lifetime increases in the order of T000 (4.175 0.085 ns) T010 (4.474 0.045 ns) T112 (5.931 0.085 ns).And the prolonged photoelectron lifetime of T112 is due to a lower recombination process, which allows more efficient photoelectron migration and separation, in well agreement with the steady-state PL results 41.To elucidate the charge separation and migration efficiency of samples, the photoelectrochemical properties of the photocurrent transient response experiments were performed in five on-off cycles.The photocurrent intensity of T112 shows a significant enhancement compared with those of T000 and T010, manifesting the more effective charge migration occurred on the surface of T112 (Fig. 4c).The Nyquist plots from the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements further supported this judgment, where T112 exhibits the smallest radius, confirming the lowest charge transfer resistance (Rct) and the fastest interfacial charge transfer process (Fig. 4d).The electrochemical experiments of linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves were performed with a CO 2 -and N 2 -saturated atmosphere, respectively, to in-depth understand the catalytic activities among these samples (Fig. 4e) 42.The results revealed that the current density under a CO 2 atmosphere is higher than those under N 2 atmosphere at the same potential.The onset potentials of T112 electrodes shift to a lower value compared with others in the CO 2 atmosphere.The onset potentials of these samples are in the order of T112 T010 T000.And the corresponding Tafel plots were calculated based on LSV curves of CO 2 reduction (Fig. 4f), T112 shows a minimum Tafel slope with a lower reduced kinetic barrier for CO 2 reduction 43.The results indicate that the NH 2 -MIL-125(Ti) with different facets exposed have different CO 2 photocatalytic reduction abilities, particularly the high-index 1 1 2 facets exposed in T112 have superior photocatalytic activity (Table S5). Based on the above discussion, a possible mechanism concerning the superior photocatalytic CO 2 conversion performance of NH 2 -MIL-125 (Ti) with exposing high-index facets was proposed (Fig. 5).The HOMO- LUMO gap can be adjusted by exposing the different facets, high-index facets exposed to show a narrow HOMO-LUMO gap in favor of the electrons photoexcited.While the low photoreduction activity of T000 with 0 0 1/1 1 1 facets exposed results from the electronic band structure, which is hard to generate electron by photoexcitation.Under simulated light irradiation, the electrons in the HOMO level were excited and the photoinduced electrons can be transferred to the LUMO level positions, which trigger the reduction reaction due to the appropriate value being higher than the value of CO 2 -to-CO (-0.52 eV) and CO 2 -to-CH 4 (-0.24eV) conversion.Combined with the efficient active sites provided by high specific surface area and CO 2 adsorption, the CO 2 molecules are adsorbed on the surface and activated by the photoexcited electrons.Meanwhile, Ti IV on the exposed facets of NH 2 -MIL-125(Ti) was converted to Ti III by capturing the electrons during the photocatalytic reaction process.And Ti III sites have strong reducibility to realize the CO 2 -to-CO and CO 2 -to-CH 4 conversion.Hence, T112 with exposing the high-index facets acts as a more effective photocatalyst for CO 2 reduction by a synergy of more active sites and effectively charge separation and migration."}], "reactor type": [{"llm generation": "Slurry", "source": "Each sample (5 mg) was dispersed in MeCN (15 mL) and water (1.0 mL) with triethanolamine (TEOA) (3 mL) as a sacrificial agent, ultrasonicated to produce a suspension, and transferred into the reaction cell with 4 cm in diameter.", "context": "0 0 1/1 1 1 facets (T000): 2-Aminoterephthalic acid (NH 2 -BDC) (0.28 g, 1.55 mmol) was added into a mixed solvent of N,Ndimethylformamide (DMF) (7.5 mL) and methanol (MeOH) (2.5 mL) with ultrasonication, and then titanium tetraisopropanolate (TPOT) (0.3 mL) was added under ultrasonication for another 5 min.The mixture was transferred into a 30 mL Teflon-line steel autoclave and kept at 150 C for 8 h.The yellow products were collected, washed with DMF and MeOH several times, and dried for 5 h at 80 C under reduced pressure. 0 0 1/1 1 1/0 1 0 facets (T010): DMF (9.0 mL) and MeOH (1.0 mL) form the mixed solvent.NH 2 -BDC (0.37 g, 2.04 mmol) was added into the mixed solvent with sonication.Then, titanium butoxide (TBOT) (0.45 mL) and acetic acid (AA) (0.25 mL) were added with ultrasonication for another 5 min.The mixture was transferred into a 18 mL Teflon-line steel autoclave, and heated at 150 C for 24 h.After that the procedure is the same as that for preparation of T000.0 0 1/1 1 1/1 1 2 facets (T112): NH 2 -BDC (0.54 g, 2.48 mmol) was dispersed into a mixed solvent of DMF (9.0 mL) and MeOH (1.0 mL) with ultrasonication.Then, TBOT (0.25 mL) was added and ultrasonication for another 5 min.The mixture was transferred into a 18 mL Teflon-line steel autoclave, and heated at 150 C for 72 h, followed by the same procedure as mentioned above.
