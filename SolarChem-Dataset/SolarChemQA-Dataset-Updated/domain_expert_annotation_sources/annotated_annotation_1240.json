The fabrication of the TNTA via the anodization technique consists of three main steps: preparing the metallic substrate, the anodizing, and the heat treatment.For most applications, anodizing and heat treatment require longer times.The anodizing time can vary from 20 min to 24 h (Santos et al., 2021).The production of nanotubes with a large length and high-aspect ratio requires long anodizing times.Besides, to obtain a high-ordered array, two anodization steps might be necessary.The heat treatment is usually performed at 450-600 C for 1-3 h, disregarding the warm-up and cooling steps, which require additional hours. In the Ti anodization, the TNTA films are grown on the surface of Ti substrates by the anodic oxidation of Ti metallic to TiO 2 , usually in organic media containing fluoride ions.The morphology of the nanostructured film is controlled by the anodizing conditions, i. e. the applied voltage, temperature, electrolyte composition, and anodizing time (Trivinho-Strixino et al., 2017).Applied voltage, for instance, tends to influence the nanotube inner diameter, whereas the temperature, water, and fluoride content can affect the dimensions and shape of the nanotube walls.Anodizing time usually influences the nanotube length (Vargas et al., 2019).In this study, considering that only the outermost surface layer of the amorphous catalyst is active for CO 2 photoreduction, the samples were anodizing for 30 min to produce a thinner film.This approach avoids that the light penetrating too deep inside into the am-TNTA film since traps in the bulk of the material can compromise the reduction and oxidation potential of the electrons and holes, inhibiting transport and charge transfer (Baccaro and Gutz, 2018). Therefore, TNTA films were grown over Ti substrate via potentiostatic anodization at 50 V for 30 min in Ethylene glycol media containing 0.75 wt.NH 4 F and 10 vol.Water.The same anodizing conditions (except the anodized area) were used for all the samples used in this study.The current transients were monitored to assure the experiments repeatability and, consequently, the homogeneity of the material properties in the samples with different anodized areas (see SI file for details). Fig. 1A depicts the current density vs. time curve, divided into three typical regions (Ferreira et al., 2019).Region I is characterized by the abrupt drop of the current density in the early stages of the anodization (0-15 s) until reaching a minimum value denoted by point a in the inset of Fig. 1A.This current reduction is promoted by the formation of the compact oxide film, namely barrier oxide, which increases the resistance of the system (Trivinho-Strixino et al., 2017).In region II, nucleation of the nanotubes takes place.Since the formation of open channels in the oxide offers less resistive pathways, the current density rises with the increase of the surface area of the oxide until achieving point b, where the pores achieve their maximum diameter.After this point, the oxide grows in the bottom of the nanotube, that is, into the metal/oxide interface, resulting in the enlargement of the oxide layer and the nanotube length.Simultaneously to the oxide growth reaction, fluoride ions in the electrolytic medium are promoting the dissolution of the oxide via TiF 6 -2 complex formation (Ghicov and Schmuki, 2009).In region III, the oxide formation reaction and dissolution process reach a steady-state resulting in the vertical growth of the nanotubular structure of TiO 2 .The stages of the oxide layer formation over the titanium substrate monitored by the anodization curve (Fig. 1A) are illustrated in Fig. 1B.This schematic illustration shows the steps of titanium anodic oxidation, including the barrier oxide film formation, pores nucleation, and nanotubes growth into the substrate. Fig. 1C shows the nanotubular structure of the am-TNTA surface obtained by SEM.The nanotubes inner diameter presented values in the 80-120 nm range, with an average value of 100 10 nm, wall NT thickness of 26 5 nm, and a void distance between the nanotubes of 12 9 nm.The nanotube length values ranging from 3.4 to 3.9 m were determined from the SEM side view of the sample (Fig. 1D) obtained in different positions.The average thickness of 3.7 0.3 m found is similar to other TNTA films synthesized under similar conditions reported in the literature (Atyaoui et al., 2013;Hao et al., 2019).Table 1 depicts the compositional analysis of the oxide layer obtained by EDX (see the full table in Supporting Information for more details).The semi-quantitative analysis shows Ti and O elements as majority composition, as expected for the TiO 2 layers, with 33.30 At. and 45.25 At., respectively.N, F and C species from the electrolyte composed of NH 4 F and Ethylene glycol were incorporated into the film in minor quantities.The homogenous distribution of the elements along the am-TNTA surface is shown in Fig. S3. The TNTA films produced by the anodization technique under low voltages (10-60 V) are typically amorphous (Simon et al., 2019(Simon et al., , 2021)), although some authors reported traces of the anatase phase in the film synthetized at 40 V in a glycerol-based electrolyte (Macak et al., 2008).Therefore, for a full oxide crystallization, heat treatment in temperatures above 400 C is necessary (Ghicov and Schmuki, 2009;Indira et al., 2015;Santos et al., 2021).In this study, the focus is on evaluating the photocatalytic activity and stability of the amorphous material; then, the TNTA samples were used as anodized.Fig. 2 depicts the diffractograms of the metallic titanium substrate, the am-TNTA sample, and an anodized TNTA sample produced under the exact anodizing conditions, which was annealed at 450 C under air for 2 h at a 7 C min -1 heating rate.After being maintained at 450 C for 2 h in the tube furnace, the sample was cooling down to room temperature naturally. The diffractogram of the metallic Ti exhibits the Bragg peaks of the hexagonal phase according to PDF 00-044-1294 (Sailer and McCarthy, 1993), where the main peak ( 101) is observed at 40.2 .Other characteristic peaks of this metallic phase are (100) at 35.1 , (002) at 38.4 , (102) at 53 , (103) at 70.7 .These peaks are also observed in the pattern of the annealed TNTA, which reveals a mixture of hexagonal Ti and anatase TiO 2 phase, indicating that the X-ray beam reached the substrate during the scan.The main peaks of the anatase phase are indicated in the second diffractogram according to PDF 01-086-1157 (Sanchez et al., 1996), where the most intensity peak ( 101) is observed at 25.3 .Other characteristic peaks of the anatase phase are (004) at 37.9 , (200) at 48 , (105) at 54.0 , and (211) at 55.1 .The diffractogram of the am-TNTA sample was performed using a small scattering angle to minimize the effect of the metallic substrate.Its pattern is characterized by broader low-intensity peaks and a deviation from the baseline at 2 range from 10 to 35 ; a larger deviation at low 2 when compared with the other two diffractograms.The baseline deviation, broader peaks, or absence of peaks are typical for amorphous material since the crystalline materials present a regular and straight baseline, and well-defined and sharp Bragg peaks (Cullity and Stock, 2001).The broader peak around 25 (101), 37 (004), and 48 (200) in the am-TNTA diffractogram may indicate the presence of the anatase phase in a small extension.Different from powders, the crystallographic orientation of the substrate can influence the nucleation of small crystals in films during the oxide growth.However, the quantity is too small to attribute some crystalline character to the material, as reported by other authors (Macak et al., 2008).Therefore, XRD results demonstrate that TNTA without annealing is predominantly amorphous. Fig. 3 depicts the absorption spectrum of the TNTA film, where it can be seen that the semiconductor majority absorbs in the UV spectra range (390 nm).However, a small but significant absorption is also observed in the visible range (400-700 nm).Table 1 showed that am-TNTA film has 9.92 at. of N in its composition incorporated from NH 4 F content in the electrolyte during the anodization.This N content can exert some contribution to the visible light absorption observed for the am-TNTA catalyst.The incorporated nitrogen into am-TNTA, could alter the semiconductor electronic state, creating sub-energetic states (Li et al., 2010) and enhancing its photocatalytic activity under visible light irradiation. The bandgap of 3.10 eV was determined from Tauc plot (Fig. 3 inset), which was calculated using Tauc's equation (h where is the absorption coefficient, h is Planck's constant, is the radiation frequency and is equal to the speed of light in a vacuum (c) divided by the wavelength (), A is the optical constant, E g is the optical band gap, and n was assumed as 0.5 for direct transitions (Nunez et al., 2021).This bandgap value is slightly larger than the 2.84 eV observed for the am-TNTA produced under similar anodizing conditions (Hao et al., 2019), but it is typical for TiO 2 materials (Ge et al., 2016). The XPS technique was employed to analyze the surface chemical state of the synthesized catalyst.Fig. 4A depicts the XPS wide spectrum which shows the presence of Ti, O, C and a small amount of F and N, which are originated from the NH 4 F salt employed in the synthesis of the am-TNTA film.The Ti 2p spectrum (Fig. 4B) shows two peaks positioned at 459.08 eV and 464.82 eV corresponding to Ti 2p 3/2 and Ti 2p 1/2 , respectively, attributed to the chemical state Ti 4 (Mu et al., 2012;Umer et al., 2019).The XPS spectrum of O 1s (Fig. 4C) was deconvoluted into three peaks positioned at 530.30 eV, 531.51 eV, and 533.06 eV.The peak at 530.30 eV corresponds to lattice oxygen (Ti-O bond), while the peaks at 531.51 eV and 533.06 eV correspond to hydroxyl groups or water (Hao et al., 2019).The C 1s high-resolution XPS (Fig. 4D) indicates three peaks related to C-C, C-O, and COOH (Zaleska et al., 2008), originating from the Ethylene glycol used in the preparation of the am-TNTA film. For nanostructure semiconductor electrodes, information about electronic structure can be extracted from the intrinsic semiconductor properties and the transient states of the semiconductor when it interacts with the electrolyte at a given electrode potential (Berger et al., 2012).Therefore, the electrochemical characterization of the am-TNTA was performed in phosphate buffer media by CV and EIS techniques. This approach was used to investigate the electronic properties of the film and the main processes occurring in the oxide surface. Fig. 5 depicts the cyclic voltammograms of the am-TNTA in the -0.9 V to 0.9 V (vs.NHE) potential window obtained at different scan rates in phosphate buffer solution (pH 7) saturated with N 2 and CO 2 from the starting potential of -0.1 V (vs.NHE).Under these conditions, no cathodic peaks were observed during the cathodic scan toward negative potentials.In the reverse scan, an anodic peak was observed around -0.6 V vs. NHE (at 5 mV s -1 ) in the direction of the positive potentials (Fig. 5A).This anodic peak can be attributed to the oxidation of the hydrogen previously adsorbed during water discharge in the cathodic scan or to the detrapping of the electrons that will be discussed in the sequence.This peak shifted to more positive values as the scan rates increased.The current density increased linearly with the scan rate, indicating no diffusional limitations under this condition, which implies that the system is explained by electron transfer kinetics (Bertoluzzi et al., 2013).The voltammograms in Fig. 5B follow the same tendency observed in Fig. 5A, and no significant features were observed in those profiles, except for the increase of the current density at high scan rates for the electrolyte saturated with CO 2 , which may indicate that the CO 2 affect the capacitance of the system. Therefore, for better visualization of these results, the current values were divided by the corresponded scan rate and plotted as a ratio between charge and potential, as shown in Fig. 5C-D.This shape can be interpreted as a relation between the trapping/detrapping process and the electron transfers between the trap and solution (Bertoluzzi et al., 2013).At a first view, when compared these charge/potential profiles (Fig. 5C-D) with CV profiles (Fig. 5A-B), it can be noted that the processes occurring at low scan rate (5 mV s -1 , black line) exhibited the larger variation in the charge/potential ratio, indicating that slow kinetic processes are favored. The plots from Fig. 5C-D depict four regions designated by i, ii, iii, and iv, in which processes can be described as follows: in region i, the traps are being filled as the system advances toward more negative potentials.In region ii, the main process is the electron transfer in the conduction band (CB), as shown by the Mott-Schottky plot in Fig. 6, where the band edge for the electron transfer from/to CB is identified as -0.4 V vs. NHE.From Fig. 5C-D, the fast increase of the charge/potential rate is observed just after this point (-0.4V vs. NHE).In region iii of the anodic scan, the charge transfer processes occurring are originated at the CB.Region iv is characterized by the electron transfer from the trap to the solution as the potential advances toward more positive values. In region iv (Fig. 5C-D), it notes that the electron transfer from the traps is becoming slower due to the adsorption of CO 2 ; in other words, the CO 2 adsorbed becomes a trap, which can stabilize the electron for a longer time in the electrode before it can be transferred.According to Kharade and Chang (2020), this stabilization can occur via hydroxyl groups on the surface of the amorphous TiO 2 that can act as a trap for CO 2 forming carbonate species, increasing CO 2 chemisorption.Therefore, herein the scan rate becomes an important parameter.If the process is slow, more electrons are transferred at lower scan rates.On the other hand, if the process is fast enough, no difference is observed.This factor also may explain why there is no variation of charge in the region i in CO 2 saturated electrolyte (Fig. 5D).Since the CO 2 is adsorbed, the carbonated species formed by chemisorption on the surface act as a trap for electrons, resulting in no variation of the charge in the region i (Fig. 5D). Besides the flat band potential (E fb ), identified as -0.4 V vs. NHE by extrapolation of the linear part of the Mott-Schottky plots (Fig. 6), the charge carriers density (N D ) for the am-TNTA electrode was determined from the Mott-Schottky equation (Hanzu et al., 2011), where the values of 1.2 10 -19 cm -3 and 9.3 10 -19 cm -3 were found for the measurements performed in phosphate buffer solution saturated with N 2 and CO 2 , respectively, assuming a relative permittivity of 55 for TNTA (Raza et al., 2021).These results show that the flat band potential did not change with the CO 2 purge in the electrolyte, but the charge carrier density increased.One hypothesis for the high charge carrier density is the presence of carbonate groups formed on the electrode surface by chemisorption acting like donor group and making the electrons move more freely. The Nyquist plot shows the imaginary part of the complex impedance (-Z ) as a function of the real part (Z ) of the am-TNTA electrode for different frequency values.Fig. S7 (SI file) depicts the impedance spectra for the photocatalyst at -0.2 V, -0.4 V, and -0.6 V vs. NHE.These curves represent the system under three different conditions, i.e., when the applied potential is less negative than the flat band potential (E fb ), equal to E fb , and more negative than E fb .The insets exhibit the highfrequency region, where a semicircle arc is observed in the measurement carried out in electrolyte purge with N 2 at -0.2 V vs. NHE, and its shape is related to the electrolyte resistance (Mei et al., 2018;Freitas et al., 2014).Fig. 7 shows that this semicircle was not observed clearly at more negative potentials or when CO 2 was introduced into the solution. A slight deviation at the low-frequency values was observed with the increase of the solution's resistance in the CO 2 saturated electrolyte.Regarding the different behavior as a function of the applied bias in each case, the change in the semicircle format shows the reduction of the internal resistance (electrode and electrolyte) of the system at more negative potentials. Regarding the N 2 saturation, note in Fig. 7 that the values that close the pseudo-semicircle for each applied potential has the same frequency (398 Hz).This means there is an electron transfer process taking place with that time constant, which charge transfer resistance decreases when the applied potential increase.This happens until it reaches the value of the conduction band, and the transfer from the band takes place.Besides, the frequency of the process (398 Hz 3.98 10 2 s -1 ) is similar to the one reported by Bertoluzzi et al. (5 10 2 s -1 ) (Bertoluzzi and Bisquert, 2012).For the CO 2 saturated electrolyte, the pseudo-semicircle closes at a higher frequency (1000 Hz), which means that it is a faster process overlapping the traps filling, and the electron transfer has a higher resistance. Table 2 shows the capacitance and resistance values obtained fitting the data with a simulated equivalent circuit illustrated in Fig. S7.This circuit was composed of a, b, c circuit parts with resistance and capacitance elements, where R t/d is the trapping/detrapping resistance, C dl is the double-layer capacitance, R t is the resistance of the charge transfer from the trap, C t is the capacitance of the trap, C ct is the capacitance of the charge transfer process from the band, and R ct is the charge transfer resistance from the band. The results from Table 2 showed that the resistance of the trapping/ detrapping (R t/d ) and the capacitance of the double-layer (C dl ) are approximately constant in N 2 saturated electrolyte and presented no significant variation in the CO 2 case, indicating significant changes in the trapping/detrapping mechanism with the applied potential.However, compared with N 2 saturated electrolyte, the resistance (R t/d ) values are higher in CO 2 while C dl values are small.The charge transfer resistance from the traps (R t ) decreases toward more negative potentials as the traps are being filled from the solution with N 2 , but it remained constant in CO 2 solution.The capacitance of the traps (C t ) exhibits a maximum value is at -0.2 V (vs.NHE) in both cases.These values are related to the semicircles from the Nyquist plots.As the overpotential increases (potential become more negative), the resistance of the charge transfer from the traps (R ct ) reduces while the corresponding capacitance (C ct ) increases.This indicates that the accumulation of charge is diminishing toward more negative potentials. These results show that the major effect is the CO 2 on the trap filling resistance.The traps are easily or faster filled when the CO 2 is adsorbed, Fig. 7. Detail of the high-frequency regions of the Nyquist diagrams for am-TNTA film obtained in phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.0) saturated with N 2 (right) and CO 2 (left) at -0.2 V, -0.4 V, and -0.6 V vs. NHE. Capacitance and resistance elements obtained from the simulated equivalent circuit illustrated in Fig. S7 according to the applied bias.which supports the hypothesis that the CO 2 interacts directly with the traps, promoting the charge transfer from these intermediate energy levels. It is important to stress that the electrochemical impedance behavior of TNTA films described in the literature diverges one from another according to the film properties and the experimental conditions used during the measurements.So, there is no expected standardized profile for TNTA in general.Also, it is not usual to perform the analysis in CO 2 saturated electrolyte.This implies that a further systematic study should be performed to a better comprehension of these findings by changing the type of gas purged into the electrolyte, testing other pH solutions, and performing under UV-light light irradiation.Regarding this preliminary set of experiments, these EIS results can be summarized as follows: the processes at the electrode surface are affected by (i) the applied potential (more or less negative than the flat band potential of the material), and by (ii) the type of the adsorbent species since the presence and absence of CO 2 molecules were analyzed.This latter factor is the first evidence about the interaction of CO 2 species with the am-TNTA film. Upon studying the characteristics of the synthesized am-TNTA photocatalyst film, the CO 2 photoreduction experiment in the water vapor at 39 C was conducted under UV light irradiation while the CH 4 production was monitored by GC each 30 min for 4 h.Fig. 8A shows the CO 2 photocatalytic reduction activity of the fresh catalyst.The CH 4 production increased with time at a constant rate of 14.0 0.7 mol g cat -1 h -1 .This is a remarkable result for an amorphous nanostructured thinfilm catalyst produced in a fast one-step synthesis without modification.This enhanced photocatalytic activity can be attributed to the surface defects of the amorphous structure, mainly OH groups acting as electron traps and increasing the electron lifetime, as will be discussed in the sequence. After the first batch of the experiment, the am-TNTA film was removed from the reactor, dried at room temperature, and labeled as 'used-catalyst'.The CO 2 reduction experiment was repeated five times over the used catalyst.The results are depicted in Fig. 8B, which shows the CH 4 production rate in the six consequently runs using the same catalyst.The rate of CH 4 production varied in the range 13.7-14.01mol g cat -1 h -1 .The small and approximately constant error bars demonstrated the high stability of catalyst for CO 2 reduction into methane during six reaction cycles.This stability is similar to those reported for the crystalline TNTA films (Kar et al., 2019) and other TiO 2 -based catalysts like the amorphous TiO 2 NH 2 -MIL-125(Ti) film (Hu et al., 2020) and black titania powders (Yin et al., 2017), which exhibited good reproducibility in consecutive experiments of the CO conversion to CH 4 without no significant reduction of photocatalytic activity during 4-6 reaction cycles. The CH 4 production rate in CO 2 photoreduction reaction with water using different TiO 2 catalysts is shown in Table 3.It is important to stress that a direct comparison is not recommended due to the differences in the light irradiation, photocatalytic experimental conditions, and catalyst form (film and powder); however, these values work as a reference for the CH 4 yield.The average CH 4 production rate of 14.0 mol g cat h -1 obtained in this study for the am-TNTA film can be considered an impressive CH 4 production rate for a pure TiO 2 with no modification, no doping, no other materials added, and no heat treatment.As a reference, it can be seen that the pure anatase TiO 2 powder (commercial Degussa P25) as photocatalyst for CO 2 conversion to methane under UV irradiation exhibited a CH 4 production rate of 4.11 mol g cat -1 h -1 (Lo et al., 2007).Regarding TNTA films, Kar et al. (2019) tunned the type of heat treatment and electrolyte composition to teste anatase, rutile, and anatase/rutile mixtures for CO 2 reduction under solar simulated irradiation obtaining different methane yields.Using their values as a reference, the CH 4 production rate for the am-TNTA under UV irradiation (this work) is more similar to those observed for anatase TNTA under the solar simulated light (Kar et al., 2019).However, the photocatalytic activity of the crystalline TNTA was attributed to the presence of Ti 3 states and oxygen vacancies produced by the annealing treatment used to sensitize the material to visible light.Herein, the photocatalytic activity of the amorphous semiconductor is attributed to the surface defects (OH groups) acting as electron traps for reducing charge recombination.The UV-vis absorption spectrum (Fig. 3) showed that the am-TNTA can absorb partially under visible light irradiation, demonstrating that the material prepared in a one-step synthetic route also has the potential to convert CO 2 to CH 4 under solar simulated light. A possible reaction pathway for CO 2 conversion to CH 4 occurring at the am-TNTA film surface is illustrated in Fig. 9.The position of the conduction band (-0.4 V vs. NHE) was determined by Mott-Schottky analysis, and the position of the valence band (2.7 V vs. NHE) was calculated from the bandgap (3.10 eV) obtained by the Tauc plot (Fig. 3).This indicates that the counter-reaction taking place to compensate the photogenerated holes is most likely the oxidation of water to produce O 2 (Bolts and Wrighton, 1976;Al Jitan et al., 2020).spectra exhibit a similar profile, with slight changes.It is important to stress the Ti substrate naturally oxide in the air forming a thin TiO 2 layer in the nanometer range.Due to this thin TiO 2 layer covering the bare Ti, a similar profile between Ti substrate and am-TNTA was expected, except for the bonds involving N, C, and F adsorbed from the electrolyte during the synthesis.Notably, the three spectra exhibit a wide broadband from 2700 to 3700 cm -1 indicating the presence of hydroxyl groups (Erdem et al., 2001).Amino groups are generally detected in this interval; however, the hydroxyl broadband could hide them.Therefore, the identification of the N-H bond in this region is inconclusive.Nonetheless, the low-intensity bands in 1070 and 1442 cm -1 in the am-TNTA fresh are attributed to N-Ti-O stretching vibration and N-H stretching vibration, respectively (Li et al., 2014), indicating some N atoms incorporated into the TiO 2 structure.These bands are not observed in am-TNTA used, suggesting an N leaching from the film.The bending vibration of the O-H bond is observed in 1654, 1632, and cm -1 for Ti substrate, am-TNTA fresh, and am-TNTA used. The low-intensity bands observed in 2114-2200 cm -1 interval in the am-TNTA used might be associated with carbonate/carboxylate species generated by interaction with the catalyst, as proposed by Neat u et al., 2014).However, these bands are also observed with lower intensity in Ti substrate, which might indicate carbonyl groups absorbed from the air over the metallic substrate.Bands at 873 and 888 cm -1 observed in Ti substrate and am-TNTA used are assigned to Ti-O stretching bands.In the FTIR spectra of the am-TNTA fresh, this band is overlapped by another broadband in 700-900 cm -1 interval with a maximum at cm -1 that can be attributed to carbon skeleton vibrations of the ethylene glycol (Leon et al., 2017) incorporated from the electrolyte into TNTA surface that could leach the film after use. The am-TNTA stability before and after recycling was evaluated by FTIR, XPS, and PL techniques.The spectra for the fresh and used catalyst are shown in Fig. S8.As discussed in Section 3.1, the Ti 2p spectrum of the fresh catalyst corresponds to the chemical state Ti 4 .The relative intensity and position of the peaks remained unchanged in the used catalyst XPS spectrum (Fig. S8-B).The XPS spectrum of O 1s (Fig. S8 C-D) revealed the presence of hydroxyl groups or water (Hao et al., 2019).The relative intensity of these peaks is almost constant in the used catalyst.The C 1s spectra (Fig. S8 E-F) indicates peaks related to C-C, C-O, and COOH (Zaleska et al., 2008), originating from the Ethylene glycol used in the preparation of the am-TNTA film.Notably, no heat treatment was done on the synthesized catalyst.However, the relative intensity of the C 1s spectrum remains almost constant in the used catalyst compared to the fresh catalyst, which is in agreement with the photocatalytic reduction results confirming that the produced methane is not originated from this carbon source but CO 2 .The XPS wide spectrum (Fig. S8 G-H) also shows the presence of a small amount of F and N, which are originated from the NH 4 F salt employed in the synthesis of the am-TNTA film. The PL spectra of fresh and used catalysts until the fourth cycle are illustrated in Fig. 11.The emission spectra were collected with excitation at 325 nm wavelength and revealed that the am-TNTA does not present a broadband emission, but several peaks in the whole range of wavelength, indicating multiphononic processes.This behavior, observed for the fresh and used catalyst, was reported in other studies from the literature (Bavykin et al., 2005;Vijayan et al., 2012).In the PL properties of colloidal TiO 2 nanotubes produced by the alkali hydrothermal method (Bavykin et al., 2005), many sharp peaks were observed in the 300-700 nm range.The authors attributed the sharp bands to the low energy states as residual cations incorporated in the material during the synthesis.A similar feature was reported for TiO 2 nanotubes and carbon nanotubes composites (Vijayan et al., 2012).Usually, these sharp bands in PL spectra of semiconductors are attributed to transitions involving impurities states, doping, and the existence of trap states in bandgap promoted by defects.In other PL spectra of TNTA films, broadbands emission was observed and deconvoluted into many emission peaks in the whole range of emission wavelength (Siuzdak et al. 2015a(Siuzdak et al. , 2015b)).The authors suggested that the presence of several peaks in the PL spectrum of TiO 2 nanotubes could have resulted from the existence of sub-bandgap states in the complex structure of nanotubes (Siuzdak et al., 2015b). This behavior implies that several paths for the emission due to the high density of electronic states caused by defects (Mendez-Galvan et al., 2021).These peaks confirm the presence of many deep and shallow surface states, which could enhance the separation of electron/hole pairs and decrease the recombination rate of photoexcited charge carriers (Wang et al., 2018).These defects can be promoted by different oxygen defects like mono-ionized oxygen vacancies (shallow defects) and double-ionized oxygen vacancies (deep defects) formed as a consequence of doping/modification or heat treatment, or they can be caused by hydroxyl/water groups which can trap the electrons and act as shallow acceptor levels (Kharade and Chang, 2020;Mendez-Galvan et al., 2021).For the am-TNTA film, FTIR, XPS, and EIS results evidence that these defects are probably caused by the hydroxyl groups acting as a trap for the CO 2 via formation of carbonate species.On the other hand, the results showed a small absorption of the am-TNTA in the visible light region (Fig. 3) that can be attributed to N incorporated into the film during the synthesis, as suggested by other authors (Li et al., 2010), which can act as impurities in the synthesized material, creating sub-bandgap states. Regarding the intensity of the emission peak, some factors might be contributed to a low emission peak of the am-TNTA film.Since the film was grown on a titanium conductive substrate, the separation of charge carriers due to the transfer of electrons to the conductive substrate could suppress the intensity of PL emission.Another factor is the amorphous character of the am-TNTA.Crystalline semiconductors are expected to exhibit high intensity PL due to their low recombination radioactive when compared with the amorphous. Furthermore, the PL spectra of the used catalyst slightly declined when compared to the fresh catalyst.This minor decrease could result from the adsorption of either reactants or products on the catalyst.Stevanovic et al. (2012) studied the effect of several adsorbed molecules on the PL spectrum of TiO 2 .They found that adsorption of either electron donor or electron acceptor species decreases the PL intensity of the TiO 2 catalyst.The reduction in the PL intensity was related to the band bending and formation of the depletion layer.However, the reduction in the PL intensity in Fig. 11 is insignificant, which agrees with the catalyst stability for methane formation in the repeated experiments. In correspondence to the PL analysis, the C 1s spectrum of XPS (Fig. S8 E-F) does not indicate any noticeable change in the amount of carbon on the catalyst surface.Also, the presence of the irreversible adsorbed oxygenated intermediates or products on the surface of the film should change the O 1s XPS high-resolution spectrum, which has remained almost unchanged in the used catalyst compared to the fresh catalyst.Therefore, the prepared am-TNTA film is highly stable for CO 2 photocatalytic reduction. It is important to discuss some aspects about the findings correlating all data.The results show that photocatalytic activity of the am-TNTA film in the CO 2 reduction to CH 4 can be explained in terms of defects caused by the surface hydroxyl species.Traps are electronic energy levels located in the bandgap of a semiconductor and are involved in the charge-transfer process (Wang et al., 2001).It includes surface states, oxygen vacancies, adsorbed species.Shallow defects are energetically closed to CB or VB, whereas deep defects are energetically closed to the Fermi level (Mendez-Galvan et al., 2021).A nanostructured morphology like the TNTA presents a large number of electron traps at the surface and the grain boundaries, influencing the interfacial kinetics of the transfer processes.The detrapping is possible for these shallow traps, but the deep (bulk) traps can immobilize carriers irreversibly (Wehrenfennig et al., 2015), compromising the charge transfer processes.This is the main reason for the short anodizing time chosen in the synthesis in this study.A longer anodizing time would produce a longer nanotube length, where the light could penetrate deeply, reaching the bulk traps and, consequently, reducing the efficiency of the photocatalytic process. Among these defects, Ti 3 surface states, mono-ionized oxygen vacancies (shallow traps), and doubled-ionized oxygen vacancies (deep traps) were not evidenced in this study.On the other hand, the presence of surface hydroxyl groups was evidenced by FTIR and XPS analysis of am-TNTA film.Hydroxyl groups are considered dominant sites for trapping electrons acting as shallow acceptor levels (Mendez-Galvan et al., 2021).PL spectra (Fig. 11) showed many states attributed to shallow defects that can be promoted by these hydroxyl/water groups.In the case of CO 2 photoreduction, the hydroxyl groups act like traps via formation of the carbonate species (Kharade and Chang, 2020), as suggested by the analysis of the electrochemical data.Therefore, since CO 2 interacts directly with the traps, forming carbonate species, we can assume that, in the am-TNTA film, the charge is transferred directly from these shallow levels.To evaluate the effect of the deep defects of am-TNTA film on the photocatalytic activity in CO 2 reduction, further studies are necessary by fabricating the am-TNTA with different thicknesses, nanotube diameter, and nanotube walls.This study will also be important to verify if the charge carriers from different trap states are homogeneously distributed along the nanotube length and diameter.The effect of these defects on the selectivity towards specific products also should be addressed. The main consequence of these traps is the increase of the electron lifetime, favoring the photocatalytic activity of the am-TNTA and preventing them from charge recombination.The recombination of charge carriers (electron/hole pairs) is a major challenge in developing an efficient photocatalyst.The lifetime of photoexcited electrons and holes is estimated to be in the order of 10 -9 s, while the CO 2 reduction reaction requires a longer time (Fan et al., 2013).Therefore, any change which could decrease the recombination rate of electrons and holes will significantly improve the photocatalytic reduction efficiency.Moreover, metals generally have lower Fermi energies than semiconductors which implies that electrons transfer from the semiconductor to the metal.This flow of electrons will lead to the formation of the Schottky barrier at the interface of the conductor/semiconductor that functions as an effective electron trap.Consequently, the formation of the Schottky barrier will increase the lifetime of the excited electrons, which is essential for developing an efficient photocatalyst (Khan et al., 2015).However, it is important to stress that the charge transfer processes in the amorphous material are not faster as the crystalline TiO 2 .Therefore, this is a factor that also should be addressed in the development of the catalyst."}, {"llm generation": "pure anatase TiO 2 powder (commercial Degussa P25) as photocatalyst", "source": "As a reference, it can be seen that the pure anatase TiO 2 powder (commercial Degussa P25) as photocatalyst for CO 2 conversion to methane under UV irradiation exhibited a CH 4 production rate of 4.11 mol g cat -1 h -1 (Lo et al., 2007).", "context": "The anodization of Titanium and other valve metals is a well-known technique used to produce nanostructured oxide films (Lee et al., 2014;Indira et al., 2015;Trivinho-Strixino et al., 2017).These nanomaterials are extensively explored in numerous applications in energy, biological and environmental fields due to their facile synthesis with environmental-friendly experimental conditions (mild temperature and low-toxicity reagents) and control of morphology, composition, and structure by the synthetic parameters (Santos et al., 2021).Additionally, the resulting oxides coatings exhibit high surface area per volume, chemical stability, and rigid adhesion between metal and oxide layer, avoiding the use of binder agents. The fabrication of the TNTA via the anodization technique consists of three main steps: preparing the metallic substrate, the anodizing, and the heat treatment.For most applications, anodizing and heat treatment require longer times.The anodizing time can vary from 20 min to 24 h (Santos et al., 2021).The production of nanotubes with a large length and high-aspect ratio requires long anodizing times.Besides, to obtain a high-ordered array, two anodization steps might be necessary.The heat treatment is usually performed at 450-600 C for 1-3 h, disregarding the warm-up and cooling steps, which require additional hours. In the Ti anodization, the TNTA films are grown on the surface of Ti substrates by the anodic oxidation of Ti metallic to TiO 2 , usually in organic media containing fluoride ions.The morphology of the nanostructured film is controlled by the anodizing conditions, i. e. the applied voltage, temperature, electrolyte composition, and anodizing time (Trivinho-Strixino et al., 2017).Applied voltage, for instance, tends to influence the nanotube inner diameter, whereas the temperature, water, and fluoride content can affect the dimensions and shape of the nanotube walls.Anodizing time usually influences the nanotube length (Vargas et al., 2019).In this study, considering that only the outermost surface layer of the amorphous catalyst is active for CO 2 photoreduction, the samples were anodizing for 30 min to produce a thinner film.This approach avoids that the light penetrating too deep inside into the am-TNTA film since traps in the bulk of the material can compromise the reduction and oxidation potential of the electrons and holes, inhibiting transport and charge transfer (Baccaro and Gutz, 2018). Therefore, TNTA films were grown over Ti substrate via potentiostatic anodization at 50 V for 30 min in Ethylene glycol media containing 0.75 wt.NH 4 F and 10 vol.Water.The same anodizing conditions (except the anodized area) were used for all the samples used in this study.The current transients were monitored to assure the experiments repeatability and, consequently, the homogeneity of the material properties in the samples with different anodized areas (see SI file for details). Fig. 1A depicts the current density vs. time curve, divided into three typical regions (Ferreira et al., 2019).Region I is characterized by the abrupt drop of the current density in the early stages of the anodization (0-15 s) until reaching a minimum value denoted by point a in the inset of Fig. 1A.This current reduction is promoted by the formation of the compact oxide film, namely barrier oxide, which increases the resistance of the system (Trivinho-Strixino et al., 2017).In region II, nucleation of the nanotubes takes place.Since the formation of open channels in the oxide offers less resistive pathways, the current density rises with the increase of the surface area of the oxide until achieving point b, where the pores achieve their maximum diameter.After this point, the oxide grows in the bottom of the nanotube, that is, into the metal/oxide interface, resulting in the enlargement of the oxide layer and the nanotube length.Simultaneously to the oxide growth reaction, fluoride ions in the electrolytic medium are promoting the dissolution of the oxide via TiF 6 -2 complex formation (Ghicov and Schmuki, 2009).In region III, the oxide formation reaction and dissolution process reach a steady-state resulting in the vertical growth of the nanotubular structure of TiO 2 .The stages of the oxide layer formation over the titanium substrate monitored by the anodization curve (Fig. 1A) are illustrated in Fig. 1B.This schematic illustration shows the steps of titanium anodic oxidation, including the barrier oxide film formation, pores nucleation, and nanotubes growth into the substrate. Fig. 1C shows the nanotubular structure of the am-TNTA surface obtained by SEM.The nanotubes inner diameter presented values in the 80-120 nm range, with an average value of 100 10 nm, wall NT thickness of 26 5 nm, and a void distance between the nanotubes of 12 9 nm.The nanotube length values ranging from 3.4 to 3.9 m were determined from the SEM side view of the sample (Fig. 1D) obtained in different positions.The average thickness of 3.7 0.3 m found is similar to other TNTA films synthesized under similar conditions reported in the literature (Atyaoui et al., 2013;Hao et al., 2019).Table 1 depicts the compositional analysis of the oxide layer obtained by EDX (see the full table in Supporting Information for more details).The semi-quantitative analysis shows Ti and O elements as majority composition, as expected for the TiO 2 layers, with 33.30 At. and 45.25 At., respectively.N, F and C species from the electrolyte composed of NH 4 F and Ethylene glycol were incorporated into the film in minor quantities.The homogenous distribution of the elements along the am-TNTA surface is shown in Fig. S3. The TNTA films produced by the anodization technique under low voltages (10-60 V) are typically amorphous (Simon et al., 2019(Simon et al., , 2021)), although some authors reported traces of the anatase phase in the film synthetized at 40 V in a glycerol-based electrolyte (Macak et al., 2008).Therefore, for a full oxide crystallization, heat treatment in temperatures above 400 C is necessary (Ghicov and Schmuki, 2009;Indira et al., 2015;Santos et al., 2021).In this study, the focus is on evaluating the photocatalytic activity and stability of the amorphous material; then, the TNTA samples were used as anodized.Fig. 2 depicts the diffractograms of the metallic titanium substrate, the am-TNTA sample, and an anodized TNTA sample produced under the exact anodizing conditions, which was annealed at 450 C under air for 2 h at a 7 C min -1 heating rate.After being maintained at 450 C for 2 h in the tube furnace, the sample was cooling down to room temperature naturally. The diffractogram of the metallic Ti exhibits the Bragg peaks of the hexagonal phase according to PDF 00-044-1294 (Sailer and McCarthy, 1993), where the main peak ( 101) is observed at 40.2 .Other characteristic peaks of this metallic phase are (100) at 35.1 , (002) at 38.4 , (102) at 53 , (103) at 70.7 .These peaks are also observed in the pattern of the annealed TNTA, which reveals a mixture of hexagonal Ti and anatase TiO 2 phase, indicating that the X-ray beam reached the substrate during the scan.The main peaks of the anatase phase are indicated in the second diffractogram according to PDF 01-086-1157 (Sanchez et al., 1996), where the most intensity peak ( 101) is observed at 25.3 .Other characteristic peaks of the anatase phase are (004) at 37.9 , (200) at 48 , (105) at 54.0 , and (211) at 55.1 .The diffractogram of the am-TNTA sample was performed using a small scattering angle to minimize the effect of the metallic substrate.Its pattern is characterized by broader low-intensity peaks and a deviation from the baseline at 2 range from 10 to 35 ; a larger deviation at low 2 when compared with the other two diffractograms.The baseline deviation, broader peaks, or absence of peaks are typical for amorphous material since the crystalline materials present a regular and straight baseline, and well-defined and sharp Bragg peaks (Cullity and Stock, 2001).The broader peak around 25 (101), 37 (004), and 48 (200) in the am-TNTA diffractogram may indicate the presence of the anatase phase in a small extension.Different from powders, the crystallographic orientation of the substrate can influence the nucleation of small crystals in films during the oxide growth.However, the quantity is too small to attribute some crystalline character to the material, as reported by other authors (Macak et al., 2008).Therefore, XRD results demonstrate that TNTA without annealing is predominantly amorphous. Fig. 3 depicts the absorption spectrum of the TNTA film, where it can be seen that the semiconductor majority absorbs in the UV spectra range (390 nm).However, a small but significant absorption is also observed in the visible range (400-700 nm).Table 1 showed that am-TNTA film has 9.92 at. of N in its composition incorporated from NH 4 F content in the electrolyte during the anodization.This N content can exert some contribution to the visible light absorption observed for the am-TNTA catalyst.The incorporated nitrogen into am-TNTA, could alter the semiconductor electronic state, creating sub-energetic states (Li et al., 2010) and enhancing its photocatalytic activity under visible light irradiation. The bandgap of 3.10 eV was determined from Tauc plot (Fig. 3 inset), which was calculated using Tauc's equation (h where is the absorption coefficient, h is Planck's constant, is the radiation frequency and is equal to the speed of light in a vacuum (c) divided by the wavelength (), A is the optical constant, E g is the optical band gap, and n was assumed as 0.5 for direct transitions (Nunez et al., 2021).This bandgap value is slightly larger than the 2.84 eV observed for the am-TNTA produced under similar anodizing conditions (Hao et al., 2019), but it is typical for TiO 2 materials (Ge et al., 2016). The XPS technique was employed to analyze the surface chemical state of the synthesized catalyst.Fig. 4A depicts the XPS wide spectrum which shows the presence of Ti, O, C and a small amount of F and N, which are originated from the NH 4 F salt employed in the synthesis of the am-TNTA film.The Ti 2p spectrum (Fig. 4B) shows two peaks positioned at 459.08 eV and 464.82 eV corresponding to Ti 2p 3/2 and Ti 2p 1/2 , respectively, attributed to the chemical state Ti 4 (Mu et al., 2012;Umer et al., 2019).The XPS spectrum of O 1s (Fig. 4C) was deconvoluted into three peaks positioned at 530.30 eV, 531.51 eV, and 533.06 eV.The peak at 530.30 eV corresponds to lattice oxygen (Ti-O bond), while the peaks at 531.51 eV and 533.06 eV correspond to hydroxyl groups or water (Hao et al., 2019).The C 1s high-resolution XPS (Fig. 4D) indicates three peaks related to C-C, C-O, and COOH (Zaleska et al., 2008), originating from the Ethylene glycol used in the preparation of the am-TNTA film. For nanostructure semiconductor electrodes, information about electronic structure can be extracted from the intrinsic semiconductor properties and the transient states of the semiconductor when it interacts with the electrolyte at a given electrode potential (Berger et al., 2012).Therefore, the electrochemical characterization of the am-TNTA was performed in phosphate buffer media by CV and EIS techniques. This approach was used to investigate the electronic properties of the film and the main processes occurring in the oxide surface. Fig. 5 depicts the cyclic voltammograms of the am-TNTA in the -0.9 V to 0.9 V (vs.NHE) potential window obtained at different scan rates in phosphate buffer solution (pH 7) saturated with N 2 and CO 2 from the starting potential of -0.1 V (vs.NHE).Under these conditions, no cathodic peaks were observed during the cathodic scan toward negative potentials.In the reverse scan, an anodic peak was observed around -0.6 V vs. NHE (at 5 mV s -1 ) in the direction of the positive potentials (Fig. 5A).This anodic peak can be attributed to the oxidation of the hydrogen previously adsorbed during water discharge in the cathodic scan or to the detrapping of the electrons that will be discussed in the sequence.This peak shifted to more positive values as the scan rates increased.The current density increased linearly with the scan rate, indicating no diffusional limitations under this condition, which implies that the system is explained by electron transfer kinetics (Bertoluzzi et al., 2013).The voltammograms in Fig. 5B follow the same tendency observed in Fig. 5A, and no significant features were observed in those profiles, except for the increase of the current density at high scan rates for the electrolyte saturated with CO 2 , which may indicate that the CO 2 affect the capacitance of the system. Therefore, for better visualization of these results, the current values were divided by the corresponded scan rate and plotted as a ratio between charge and potential, as shown in Fig. 5C-D.This shape can be interpreted as a relation between the trapping/detrapping process and the electron transfers between the trap and solution (Bertoluzzi et al., 2013).At a first view, when compared these charge/potential profiles (Fig. 5C-D) with CV profiles (Fig. 5A-B), it can be noted that the processes occurring at low scan rate (5 mV s -1 , black line) exhibited the larger variation in the charge/potential ratio, indicating that slow kinetic processes are favored. The plots from Fig. 5C-D depict four regions designated by i, ii, iii, and iv, in which processes can be described as follows: in region i, the traps are being filled as the system advances toward more negative potentials.In region ii, the main process is the electron transfer in the conduction band (CB), as shown by the Mott-Schottky plot in Fig. 6, where the band edge for the electron transfer from/to CB is identified as -0.4 V vs. NHE.From Fig. 5C-D, the fast increase of the charge/potential rate is observed just after this point (-0.4V vs. NHE).In region iii of the anodic scan, the charge transfer processes occurring are originated at the CB.Region iv is characterized by the electron transfer from the trap to the solution as the potential advances toward more positive values. In region iv (Fig. 5C-D), it notes that the electron transfer from the traps is becoming slower due to the adsorption of CO 2 ; in other words, the CO 2 adsorbed becomes a trap, which can stabilize the electron for a longer time in the electrode before it can be transferred.According to Kharade and Chang (2020), this stabilization can occur via hydroxyl groups on the surface of the amorphous TiO 2 that can act as a trap for CO 2 forming carbonate species, increasing CO 2 chemisorption.Therefore, herein the scan rate becomes an important parameter.If the process is slow, more electrons are transferred at lower scan rates.On the other hand, if the process is fast enough, no difference is observed.This factor also may explain why there is no variation of charge in the region i in CO 2 saturated electrolyte (Fig. 5D).Since the CO 2 is adsorbed, the carbonated species formed by chemisorption on the surface act as a trap for electrons, resulting in no variation of the charge in the region i (Fig. 5D). Besides the flat band potential (E fb ), identified as -0.4 V vs. NHE by extrapolation of the linear part of the Mott-Schottky plots (Fig. 6), the charge carriers density (N D ) for the am-TNTA electrode was determined from the Mott-Schottky equation (Hanzu et al., 2011), where the values of 1.2 10 -19 cm -3 and 9.3 10 -19 cm -3 were found for the measurements performed in phosphate buffer solution saturated with N 2 and CO 2 , respectively, assuming a relative permittivity of 55 for TNTA (Raza et al., 2021).These results show that the flat band potential did not change with the CO 2 purge in the electrolyte, but the charge carrier density increased.One hypothesis for the high charge carrier density is the presence of carbonate groups formed on the electrode surface by chemisorption acting like donor group and making the electrons move more freely. The Nyquist plot shows the imaginary part of the complex impedance (-Z ) as a function of the real part (Z ) of the am-TNTA electrode for different frequency values.Fig. S7 (SI file) depicts the impedance spectra for the photocatalyst at -0.2 V, -0.4 V, and -0.6 V vs. NHE.These curves represent the system under three different conditions, i.e., when the applied potential is less negative than the flat band potential (E fb ), equal to E fb , and more negative than E fb .The insets exhibit the highfrequency region, where a semicircle arc is observed in the measurement carried out in electrolyte purge with N 2 at -0.2 V vs. NHE, and its shape is related to the electrolyte resistance (Mei et al., 2018;Freitas et al., 2014).Fig. 7 shows that this semicircle was not observed clearly at more negative potentials or when CO 2 was introduced into the solution. A slight deviation at the low-frequency values was observed with the increase of the solution's resistance in the CO 2 saturated electrolyte.Regarding the different behavior as a function of the applied bias in each case, the change in the semicircle format shows the reduction of the internal resistance (electrode and electrolyte) of the system at more negative potentials. Regarding the N 2 saturation, note in Fig. 7 that the values that close the pseudo-semicircle for each applied potential has the same frequency (398 Hz).This means there is an electron transfer process taking place with that time constant, which charge transfer resistance decreases when the applied potential increase.This happens until it reaches the value of the conduction band, and the transfer from the band takes place.Besides, the frequency of the process (398 Hz 3.98 10 2 s -1 ) is similar to the one reported by Bertoluzzi et al. (5 10 2 s -1 ) (Bertoluzzi and Bisquert, 2012).For the CO 2 saturated electrolyte, the pseudo-semicircle closes at a higher frequency (1000 Hz), which means that it is a faster process overlapping the traps filling, and the electron transfer has a higher resistance. Table 2 shows the capacitance and resistance values obtained fitting the data with a simulated equivalent circuit illustrated in Fig. S7.This circuit was composed of a, b, c circuit parts with resistance and capacitance elements, where R t/d is the trapping/detrapping resistance, C dl is the double-layer capacitance, R t is the resistance of the charge transfer from the trap, C t is the capacitance of the trap, C ct is the capacitance of the charge transfer process from the band, and R ct is the charge transfer resistance from the band. The results from Table 2 showed that the resistance of the trapping/ detrapping (R t/d ) and the capacitance of the double-layer (C dl ) are approximately constant in N 2 saturated electrolyte and presented no significant variation in the CO 2 case, indicating significant changes in the trapping/detrapping mechanism with the applied potential.However, compared with N 2 saturated electrolyte, the resistance (R t/d ) values are higher in CO 2 while C dl values are small.The charge transfer resistance from the traps (R t ) decreases toward more negative potentials as the traps are being filled from the solution with N 2 , but it remained constant in CO 2 solution.The capacitance of the traps (C t ) exhibits a maximum value is at -0.2 V (vs.NHE) in both cases.These values are related to the semicircles from the Nyquist plots.As the overpotential increases (potential become more negative), the resistance of the charge transfer from the traps (R ct ) reduces while the corresponding capacitance (C ct ) increases.This indicates that the accumulation of charge is diminishing toward more negative potentials. These results show that the major effect is the CO 2 on the trap filling resistance.The traps are easily or faster filled when the CO 2 is adsorbed, Fig. 7. Detail of the high-frequency regions of the Nyquist diagrams for am-TNTA film obtained in phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.0) saturated with N 2 (right) and CO 2 (left) at -0.2 V, -0.4 V, and -0.6 V vs. NHE. Capacitance and resistance elements obtained from the simulated equivalent circuit illustrated in Fig. S7 according to the applied bias.which supports the hypothesis that the CO 2 interacts directly with the traps, promoting the charge transfer from these intermediate energy levels. It is important to stress that the electrochemical impedance behavior of TNTA films described in the literature diverges one from another according to the film properties and the experimental conditions used during the measurements.So, there is no expected standardized profile for TNTA in general.Also, it is not usual to perform the analysis in CO 2 saturated electrolyte.This implies that a further systematic study should be performed to a better comprehension of these findings by changing the type of gas purged into the electrolyte, testing other pH solutions, and performing under UV-light light irradiation.Regarding this preliminary set of experiments, these EIS results can be summarized as follows: the processes at the electrode surface are affected by (i) the applied potential (more or less negative than the flat band potential of the material), and by (ii) the type of the adsorbent species since the presence and absence of CO 2 molecules were analyzed.This latter factor is the first evidence about the interaction of CO 2 species with the am-TNTA film. Upon studying the characteristics of the synthesized am-TNTA photocatalyst film, the CO 2 photoreduction experiment in the water vapor at 39 C was conducted under UV light irradiation while the CH 4 production was monitored by GC each 30 min for 4 h.Fig. 8A shows the CO 2 photocatalytic reduction activity of the fresh catalyst.The CH 4 production increased with time at a constant rate of 14.0 0.7 mol g cat -1 h -1 .This is a remarkable result for an amorphous nanostructured thinfilm catalyst produced in a fast one-step synthesis without modification.This enhanced photocatalytic activity can be attributed to the surface defects of the amorphous structure, mainly OH groups acting as electron traps and increasing the electron lifetime, as will be discussed in the sequence. After the first batch of the experiment, the am-TNTA film was removed from the reactor, dried at room temperature, and labeled as 'used-catalyst'.The CO 2 reduction experiment was repeated five times over the used catalyst.The results are depicted in Fig. 8B, which shows the CH 4 production rate in the six consequently runs using the same catalyst.The rate of CH 4 production varied in the range 13.7-14.01mol g cat -1 h -1 .The small and approximately constant error bars demonstrated the high stability of catalyst for CO 2 reduction into methane during six reaction cycles.This stability is similar to those reported for the crystalline TNTA films (Kar et al., 2019) and other TiO 2 -based catalysts like the amorphous TiO 2 NH 2 -MIL-125(Ti) film (Hu et al., 2020) and black titania powders (Yin et al., 2017), which exhibited good reproducibility in consecutive experiments of the CO conversion to CH 4 without no significant reduction of photocatalytic activity during 4-6 reaction cycles. The CH 4 production rate in CO 2 photoreduction reaction with water using different TiO 2 catalysts is shown in Table 3.It is important to stress that a direct comparison is not recommended due to the differences in the light irradiation, photocatalytic experimental conditions, and catalyst form (film and powder); however, these values work as a reference for the CH 4 yield.The average CH 4 production rate of 14.0 mol g cat h -1 obtained in this study for the am-TNTA film can be considered an impressive CH 4 production rate for a pure TiO 2 with no modification, no doping, no other materials added, and no heat treatment.As a reference, it can be seen that the pure anatase TiO 2 powder (commercial Degussa P25) as photocatalyst for CO 2 conversion to methane under UV irradiation exhibited a CH 4 production rate of 4.11 mol g cat -1 h -1 (Lo et al., 2007).Regarding TNTA films, Kar et al. (2019) tunned the type of heat treatment and electrolyte composition to teste anatase, rutile, and anatase/rutile mixtures for CO 2 reduction under solar simulated irradiation obtaining different methane yields.Using their values as a reference, the CH 4 production rate for the am-TNTA under UV irradiation (this work) is more similar to those observed for anatase TNTA under the solar simulated light (Kar et al., 2019).However, the photocatalytic activity of the crystalline TNTA was attributed to the presence of Ti 3 states and oxygen vacancies produced by the annealing treatment used to sensitize the material to visible light.Herein, the photocatalytic activity of the amorphous semiconductor is attributed to the surface defects (OH groups) acting as electron traps for reducing charge recombination.The UV-vis absorption spectrum (Fig. 3) showed that the am-TNTA can absorb partially under visible light irradiation, demonstrating that the material prepared in a one-step synthetic route also has the potential to convert CO 2 to CH 4 under solar simulated light. A possible reaction pathway for CO 2 conversion to CH 4 occurring at the am-TNTA film surface is illustrated in Fig. 9.The position of the conduction band (-0.4 V vs. NHE) was determined by Mott-Schottky analysis, and the position of the valence band (2.7 V vs. NHE) was calculated from the bandgap (3.10 eV) obtained by the Tauc plot (Fig. 3).This indicates that the counter-reaction taking place to compensate the photogenerated holes is most likely the oxidation of water to produce O 2 (Bolts and Wrighton, 1976;Al Jitan et al., 2020).spectra exhibit a similar profile, with slight changes.It is important to stress the Ti substrate naturally oxide in the air forming a thin TiO 2 layer in the nanometer range.Due to this thin TiO 2 layer covering the bare Ti, a similar profile between Ti substrate and am-TNTA was expected, except for the bonds involving N, C, and F adsorbed from the electrolyte during the synthesis.Notably, the three spectra exhibit a wide broadband from 2700 to 3700 cm -1 indicating the presence of hydroxyl groups (Erdem et al., 2001).Amino groups are generally detected in this interval; however, the hydroxyl broadband could hide them.Therefore, the identification of the N-H bond in this region is inconclusive.Nonetheless, the low-intensity bands in 1070 and 1442 cm -1 in the am-TNTA fresh are attributed to N-Ti-O stretching vibration and N-H stretching vibration, respectively (Li et al., 2014), indicating some N atoms incorporated into the TiO 2 structure.These bands are not observed in am-TNTA used, suggesting an N leaching from the film.The bending vibration of the O-H bond is observed in 1654, 1632, and cm -1 for Ti substrate, am-TNTA fresh, and am-TNTA used. The low-intensity bands observed in 2114-2200 cm -1 interval in the am-TNTA used might be associated with carbonate/carboxylate species generated by interaction with the catalyst, as proposed by Neat u et al., 2014).However, these bands are also observed with lower intensity in Ti substrate, which might indicate carbonyl groups absorbed from the air over the metallic substrate.Bands at 873 and 888 cm -1 observed in Ti substrate and am-TNTA used are assigned to Ti-O stretching bands.In the FTIR spectra of the am-TNTA fresh, this band is overlapped by another broadband in 700-900 cm -1 interval with a maximum at cm -1 that can be attributed to carbon skeleton vibrations of the ethylene glycol (Leon et al., 2017) incorporated from the electrolyte into TNTA surface that could leach the film after use. The am-TNTA stability before and after recycling was evaluated by FTIR, XPS, and PL techniques.The spectra for the fresh and used catalyst are shown in Fig. S8.As discussed in Section 3.1, the Ti 2p spectrum of the fresh catalyst corresponds to the chemical state Ti 4 .The relative intensity and position of the peaks remained unchanged in the used catalyst XPS spectrum (Fig. S8-B).The XPS spectrum of O 1s (Fig. S8 C-D) revealed the presence of hydroxyl groups or water (Hao et al., 2019).The relative intensity of these peaks is almost constant in the used catalyst.The C 1s spectra (Fig. S8 E-F) indicates peaks related to C-C, C-O, and COOH (Zaleska et al., 2008), originating from the Ethylene glycol used in the preparation of the am-TNTA film.Notably, no heat treatment was done on the synthesized catalyst.However, the relative intensity of the C 1s spectrum remains almost constant in the used catalyst compared to the fresh catalyst, which is in agreement with the photocatalytic reduction results confirming that the produced methane is not originated from this carbon source but CO 2 .The XPS wide spectrum (Fig. S8 G-H) also shows the presence of a small amount of F and N, which are originated from the NH 4 F salt employed in the synthesis of the am-TNTA film. The PL spectra of fresh and used catalysts until the fourth cycle are illustrated in Fig. 11.The emission spectra were collected with excitation at 325 nm wavelength and revealed that the am-TNTA does not present a broadband emission, but several peaks in the whole range of wavelength, indicating multiphononic processes.This behavior, observed for the fresh and used catalyst, was reported in other studies from the literature (Bavykin et al., 2005;Vijayan et al., 2012).In the PL properties of colloidal TiO 2 nanotubes produced by the alkali hydrothermal method (Bavykin et al., 2005), many sharp peaks were observed in the 300-700 nm range.The authors attributed the sharp bands to the low energy states as residual cations incorporated in the material during the synthesis.A similar feature was reported for TiO 2 nanotubes and carbon nanotubes composites (Vijayan et al., 2012).Usually, these sharp bands in PL spectra of semiconductors are attributed to transitions involving impurities states, doping, and the existence of trap states in bandgap promoted by defects.In other PL spectra of TNTA films, broadbands emission was observed and deconvoluted into many emission peaks in the whole range of emission wavelength (Siuzdak et al. 2015a(Siuzdak et al. , 2015b)).The authors suggested that the presence of several peaks in the PL spectrum of TiO 2 nanotubes could have resulted from the existence of sub-bandgap states in the complex structure of nanotubes (Siuzdak et al., 2015b). This behavior implies that several paths for the emission due to the high density of electronic states caused by defects (Mendez-Galvan et al., 2021).These peaks confirm the presence of many deep and shallow surface states, which could enhance the separation of electron/hole pairs and decrease the recombination rate of photoexcited charge carriers (Wang et al., 2018).These defects can be promoted by different oxygen defects like mono-ionized oxygen vacancies (shallow defects) and double-ionized oxygen vacancies (deep defects) formed as a consequence of doping/modification or heat treatment, or they can be caused by hydroxyl/water groups which can trap the electrons and act as shallow acceptor levels (Kharade and Chang, 2020;Mendez-Galvan et al., 2021).For the am-TNTA film, FTIR, XPS, and EIS results evidence that these defects are probably caused by the hydroxyl groups acting as a trap for the CO 2 via formation of carbonate species.On the other hand, the results showed a small absorption of the am-TNTA in the visible light region (Fig. 3) that can be attributed to N incorporated into the film during the synthesis, as suggested by other authors (Li et al., 2010), which can act as impurities in the synthesized material, creating sub-bandgap states. Regarding the intensity of the emission peak, some factors might be contributed to a low emission peak of the am-TNTA film.Since the film was grown on a titanium conductive substrate, the separation of charge carriers due to the transfer of electrons to the conductive substrate could suppress the intensity of PL emission.Another factor is the amorphous character of the am-TNTA.Crystalline semiconductors are expected to exhibit high intensity PL due to their low recombination radioactive when compared with the amorphous. Furthermore, the PL spectra of the used catalyst slightly declined when compared to the fresh catalyst.This minor decrease could result from the adsorption of either reactants or products on the catalyst.Stevanovic et al. (2012) studied the effect of several adsorbed molecules on the PL spectrum of TiO 2 .They found that adsorption of either electron donor or electron acceptor species decreases the PL intensity of the TiO 2 catalyst.The reduction in the PL intensity was related to the band bending and formation of the depletion layer.However, the reduction in the PL intensity in Fig. 11 is insignificant, which agrees with the catalyst stability for methane formation in the repeated experiments. In correspondence to the PL analysis, the C 1s spectrum of XPS (Fig. S8 E-F) does not indicate any noticeable change in the amount of carbon on the catalyst surface.Also, the presence of the irreversible adsorbed oxygenated intermediates or products on the surface of the film should change the O 1s XPS high-resolution spectrum, which has remained almost unchanged in the used catalyst compared to the fresh catalyst.Therefore, the prepared am-TNTA film is highly stable for CO 2 photocatalytic reduction. It is important to discuss some aspects about the findings correlating all data.The results show that photocatalytic activity of the am-TNTA film in the CO 2 reduction to CH 4 can be explained in terms of defects caused by the surface hydroxyl species.Traps are electronic energy levels located in the bandgap of a semiconductor and are involved in the charge-transfer process (Wang et al., 2001).It includes surface states, oxygen vacancies, adsorbed species.Shallow defects are energetically closed to CB or VB, whereas deep defects are energetically closed to the Fermi level (Mendez-Galvan et al., 2021).A nanostructured morphology like the TNTA presents a large number of electron traps at the surface and the grain boundaries, influencing the interfacial kinetics of the transfer processes.The detrapping is possible for these shallow traps, but the deep (bulk) traps can immobilize carriers irreversibly (Wehrenfennig et al., 2015), compromising the charge transfer processes.This is the main reason for the short anodizing time chosen in the synthesis in this study.A longer anodizing time would produce a longer nanotube length, where the light could penetrate deeply, reaching the bulk traps and, consequently, reducing the efficiency of the photocatalytic process. Among these defects, Ti 3 surface states, mono-ionized oxygen vacancies (shallow traps), and doubled-ionized oxygen vacancies (deep traps) were not evidenced in this study.On the other hand, the presence of surface hydroxyl groups was evidenced by FTIR and XPS analysis of am-TNTA film.Hydroxyl groups are considered dominant sites for trapping electrons acting as shallow acceptor levels (Mendez-Galvan et al., 2021).PL spectra (Fig. 11) showed many states attributed to shallow defects that can be promoted by these hydroxyl/water groups.In the case of CO 2 photoreduction, the hydroxyl groups act like traps via formation of the carbonate species (Kharade and Chang, 2020), as suggested by the analysis of the electrochemical data.Therefore, since CO 2 interacts directly with the traps, forming carbonate species, we can assume that, in the am-TNTA film, the charge is transferred directly from these shallow levels.To evaluate the effect of the deep defects of am-TNTA film on the photocatalytic activity in CO 2 reduction, further studies are necessary by fabricating the am-TNTA with different thicknesses, nanotube diameter, and nanotube walls.This study will also be important to verify if the charge carriers from different trap states are homogeneously distributed along the nanotube length and diameter.The effect of these defects on the selectivity towards specific products also should be addressed. The main consequence of these traps is the increase of the electron lifetime, favoring the photocatalytic activity of the am-TNTA and preventing them from charge recombination.The recombination of charge carriers (electron/hole pairs) is a major challenge in developing an efficient photocatalyst.The lifetime of photoexcited electrons and holes is estimated to be in the order of 10 -9 s, while the CO 2 reduction reaction requires a longer time (Fan et al., 2013).Therefore, any change which could decrease the recombination rate of electrons and holes will significantly improve the photocatalytic reduction efficiency.Moreover, metals generally have lower Fermi energies than semiconductors which implies that electrons transfer from the semiconductor to the metal.This flow of electrons will lead to the formation of the Schottky barrier at the interface of the conductor/semiconductor that functions as an effective electron trap.Consequently, the formation of the Schottky barrier will increase the lifetime of the excited electrons, which is essential for developing an efficient photocatalyst (Khan et al., 2015).However, it is important to stress that the charge transfer processes in the amorphous material are not faster as the crystalline TiO 2 .Therefore, this is a factor that also should be addressed in the development of the catalyst."}, {"llm generation": "catalyst", "source": "The low-intensity bands observed in 2114-2200 cm -1 interval in the am-TNTA used might be associated with carbonate/carboxylate species generated by interaction with the catalyst, as proposed by Neat u et al., 2014).", "context": "The anodization of Titanium and other valve metals is a well-known technique used to produce nanostructured oxide films (Lee et al., 2014;Indira et al., 2015;Trivinho-Strixino et al., 2017).These nanomaterials are extensively explored in numerous applications in energy, biological and environmental fields due to their facile synthesis with environmental-friendly experimental conditions (mild temperature and low-toxicity reagents) and control of morphology, composition, and structure by the synthetic parameters (Santos et al., 2021).Additionally, the resulting oxides coatings exhibit high surface area per volume, chemical stability, and rigid adhesion between metal and oxide layer, avoiding the use of binder agents. The fabrication of the TNTA via the anodization technique consists of three main steps: preparing the metallic substrate, the anodizing, and the heat treatment.For most applications, anodizing and heat treatment require longer times.The anodizing time can vary from 20 min to 24 h (Santos et al., 2021).The production of nanotubes with a large length and high-aspect ratio requires long anodizing times.Besides, to obtain a high-ordered array, two anodization steps might be necessary.The heat treatment is usually performed at 450-600 C for 1-3 h, disregarding the warm-up and cooling steps, which require additional hours. In the Ti anodization, the TNTA films are grown on the surface of Ti substrates by the anodic oxidation of Ti metallic to TiO 2 , usually in organic media containing fluoride ions.The morphology of the nanostructured film is controlled by the anodizing conditions, i. e. the applied voltage, temperature, electrolyte composition, and anodizing time (Trivinho-Strixino et al., 2017).Applied voltage, for instance, tends to influence the nanotube inner diameter, whereas the temperature, water, and fluoride content can affect the dimensions and shape of the nanotube walls.Anodizing time usually influences the nanotube length (Vargas et al., 2019).In this study, considering that only the outermost surface layer of the amorphous catalyst is active for CO 2 photoreduction, the samples were anodizing for 30 min to produce a thinner film.This approach avoids that the light penetrating too deep inside into the am-TNTA film since traps in the bulk of the material can compromise the reduction and oxidation potential of the electrons and holes, inhibiting transport and charge transfer (Baccaro and Gutz, 2018). Therefore, TNTA films were grown over Ti substrate via potentiostatic anodization at 50 V for 30 min in Ethylene glycol media containing 0.75 wt.NH 4 F and 10 vol.Water.The same anodizing conditions (except the anodized area) were used for all the samples used in this study.The current transients were monitored to assure the experiments repeatability and, consequently, the homogeneity of the material properties in the samples with different anodized areas (see SI file for details). Fig. 1A depicts the current density vs. time curve, divided into three typical regions (Ferreira et al., 2019).Region I is characterized by the abrupt drop of the current density in the early stages of the anodization (0-15 s) until reaching a minimum value denoted by point a in the inset of Fig. 1A.This current reduction is promoted by the formation of the compact oxide film, namely barrier oxide, which increases the resistance of the system (Trivinho-Strixino et al., 2017).In region II, nucleation of the nanotubes takes place.Since the formation of open channels in the oxide offers less resistive pathways, the current density rises with the increase of the surface area of the oxide until achieving point b, where the pores achieve their maximum diameter.After this point, the oxide grows in the bottom of the nanotube, that is, into the metal/oxide interface, resulting in the enlargement of the oxide layer and the nanotube length.Simultaneously to the oxide growth reaction, fluoride ions in the electrolytic medium are promoting the dissolution of the oxide via TiF 6 -2 complex formation (Ghicov and Schmuki, 2009).In region III, the oxide formation reaction and dissolution process reach a steady-state resulting in the vertical growth of the nanotubular structure of TiO 2 .The stages of the oxide layer formation over the titanium substrate monitored by the anodization curve (Fig. 1A) are illustrated in Fig. 1B.This schematic illustration shows the steps of titanium anodic oxidation, including the barrier oxide film formation, pores nucleation, and nanotubes growth into the substrate. Fig. 1C shows the nanotubular structure of the am-TNTA surface obtained by SEM.The nanotubes inner diameter presented values in the 80-120 nm range, with an average value of 100 10 nm, wall NT thickness of 26 5 nm, and a void distance between the nanotubes of 12 9 nm.The nanotube length values ranging from 3.4 to 3.9 m were determined from the SEM side view of the sample (Fig. 1D) obtained in different positions.The average thickness of 3.7 0.3 m found is similar to other TNTA films synthesized under similar conditions reported in the literature (Atyaoui et al., 2013;Hao et al., 2019).Table 1 depicts the compositional analysis of the oxide layer obtained by EDX (see the full table in Supporting Information for more details).The semi-quantitative analysis shows Ti and O elements as majority composition, as expected for the TiO 2 layers, with 33.30 At. and 45.25 At., respectively.N, F and C species from the electrolyte composed of NH 4 F and Ethylene glycol were incorporated into the film in minor quantities.The homogenous distribution of the elements along the am-TNTA surface is shown in Fig. S3. The TNTA films produced by the anodization technique under low voltages (10-60 V) are typically amorphous (Simon et al., 2019(Simon et al., , 2021)), although some authors reported traces of the anatase phase in the film synthetized at 40 V in a glycerol-based electrolyte (Macak et al., 2008).Therefore, for a full oxide crystallization, heat treatment in temperatures above 400 C is necessary (Ghicov and Schmuki, 2009;Indira et al., 2015;Santos et al., 2021).In this study, the focus is on evaluating the photocatalytic activity and stability of the amorphous material; then, the TNTA samples were used as anodized.Fig. 2 depicts the diffractograms of the metallic titanium substrate, the am-TNTA sample, and an anodized TNTA sample produced under the exact anodizing conditions, which was annealed at 450 C under air for 2 h at a 7 C min -1 heating rate.After being maintained at 450 C for 2 h in the tube furnace, the sample was cooling down to room temperature naturally. The diffractogram of the metallic Ti exhibits the Bragg peaks of the hexagonal phase according to PDF 00-044-1294 (Sailer and McCarthy, 1993), where the main peak ( 101) is observed at 40.2 .Other characteristic peaks of this metallic phase are (100) at 35.1 , (002) at 38.4 , (102) at 53 , (103) at 70.7 .These peaks are also observed in the pattern of the annealed TNTA, which reveals a mixture of hexagonal Ti and anatase TiO 2 phase, indicating that the X-ray beam reached the substrate during the scan.The main peaks of the anatase phase are indicated in the second diffractogram according to PDF 01-086-1157 (Sanchez et al., 1996), where the most intensity peak ( 101) is observed at 25.3 .Other characteristic peaks of the anatase phase are (004) at 37.9 , (200) at 48 , (105) at 54.0 , and (211) at 55.1 .The diffractogram of the am-TNTA sample was performed using a small scattering angle to minimize the effect of the metallic substrate.Its pattern is characterized by broader low-intensity peaks and a deviation from the baseline at 2 range from 10 to 35 ; a larger deviation at low 2 when compared with the other two diffractograms.The baseline deviation, broader peaks, or absence of peaks are typical for amorphous material since the crystalline materials present a regular and straight baseline, and well-defined and sharp Bragg peaks (Cullity and Stock, 2001).The broader peak around 25 (101), 37 (004), and 48 (200) in the am-TNTA diffractogram may indicate the presence of the anatase phase in a small extension.Different from powders, the crystallographic orientation of the substrate can influence the nucleation of small crystals in films during the oxide growth.However, the quantity is too small to attribute some crystalline character to the material, as reported by other authors (Macak et al., 2008).Therefore, XRD results demonstrate that TNTA without annealing is predominantly amorphous. Fig. 3 depicts the absorption spectrum of the TNTA film, where it can be seen that the semiconductor majority absorbs in the UV spectra range (390 nm).However, a small but significant absorption is also observed in the visible range (400-700 nm).Table 1 showed that am-TNTA film has 9.92 at. of N in its composition incorporated from NH 4 F content in the electrolyte during the anodization.This N content can exert some contribution to the visible light absorption observed for the am-TNTA catalyst.The incorporated nitrogen into am-TNTA, could alter the semiconductor electronic state, creating sub-energetic states (Li et al., 2010) and enhancing its photocatalytic activity under visible light irradiation. The bandgap of 3.10 eV was determined from Tauc plot (Fig. 3 inset), which was calculated using Tauc's equation (h where is the absorption coefficient, h is Planck's constant, is the radiation frequency and is equal to the speed of light in a vacuum (c) divided by the wavelength (), A is the optical constant, E g is the optical band gap, and n was assumed as 0.5 for direct transitions (Nunez et al., 2021).This bandgap value is slightly larger than the 2.84 eV observed for the am-TNTA produced under similar anodizing conditions (Hao et al., 2019), but it is typical for TiO 2 materials (Ge et al., 2016). The XPS technique was employed to analyze the surface chemical state of the synthesized catalyst.Fig. 4A depicts the XPS wide spectrum which shows the presence of Ti, O, C and a small amount of F and N, which are originated from the NH 4 F salt employed in the synthesis of the am-TNTA film.The Ti 2p spectrum (Fig. 4B) shows two peaks positioned at 459.08 eV and 464.82 eV corresponding to Ti 2p 3/2 and Ti 2p 1/2 , respectively, attributed to the chemical state Ti 4 (Mu et al., 2012;Umer et al., 2019).The XPS spectrum of O 1s (Fig. 4C) was deconvoluted into three peaks positioned at 530.30 eV, 531.51 eV, and 533.06 eV.The peak at 530.30 eV corresponds to lattice oxygen (Ti-O bond), while the peaks at 531.51 eV and 533.06 eV correspond to hydroxyl groups or water (Hao et al., 2019).The C 1s high-resolution XPS (Fig. 4D) indicates three peaks related to C-C, C-O, and COOH (Zaleska et al., 2008), originating from the Ethylene glycol used in the preparation of the am-TNTA film. For nanostructure semiconductor electrodes, information about electronic structure can be extracted from the intrinsic semiconductor properties and the transient states of the semiconductor when it interacts with the electrolyte at a given electrode potential (Berger et al., 2012).Therefore, the electrochemical characterization of the am-TNTA was performed in phosphate buffer media by CV and EIS techniques. This approach was used to investigate the electronic properties of the film and the main processes occurring in the oxide surface. Fig. 5 depicts the cyclic voltammograms of the am-TNTA in the -0.9 V to 0.9 V (vs.NHE) potential window obtained at different scan rates in phosphate buffer solution (pH 7) saturated with N 2 and CO 2 from the starting potential of -0.1 V (vs.NHE).Under these conditions, no cathodic peaks were observed during the cathodic scan toward negative potentials.In the reverse scan, an anodic peak was observed around -0.6 V vs. NHE (at 5 mV s -1 ) in the direction of the positive potentials (Fig. 5A).This anodic peak can be attributed to the oxidation of the hydrogen previously adsorbed during water discharge in the cathodic scan or to the detrapping of the electrons that will be discussed in the sequence.This peak shifted to more positive values as the scan rates increased.The current density increased linearly with the scan rate, indicating no diffusional limitations under this condition, which implies that the system is explained by electron transfer kinetics (Bertoluzzi et al., 2013).The voltammograms in Fig. 5B follow the same tendency observed in Fig. 5A, and no significant features were observed in those profiles, except for the increase of the current density at high scan rates for the electrolyte saturated with CO 2 , which may indicate that the CO 2 affect the capacitance of the system. Therefore, for better visualization of these results, the current values were divided by the corresponded scan rate and plotted as a ratio between charge and potential, as shown in Fig. 5C-D.This shape can be interpreted as a relation between the trapping/detrapping process and the electron transfers between the trap and solution (Bertoluzzi et al., 2013).At a first view, when compared these charge/potential profiles (Fig. 5C-D) with CV profiles (Fig. 5A-B), it can be noted that the processes occurring at low scan rate (5 mV s -1 , black line) exhibited the larger variation in the charge/potential ratio, indicating that slow kinetic processes are favored. The plots from Fig. 5C-D depict four regions designated by i, ii, iii, and iv, in which processes can be described as follows: in region i, the traps are being filled as the system advances toward more negative potentials.In region ii, the main process is the electron transfer in the conduction band (CB), as shown by the Mott-Schottky plot in Fig. 6, where the band edge for the electron transfer from/to CB is identified as -0.4 V vs. NHE.From Fig. 5C-D, the fast increase of the charge/potential rate is observed just after this point (-0.4V vs. NHE).In region iii of the anodic scan, the charge transfer processes occurring are originated at the CB.Region iv is characterized by the electron transfer from the trap to the solution as the potential advances toward more positive values. In region iv (Fig. 5C-D), it notes that the electron transfer from the traps is becoming slower due to the adsorption of CO 2 ; in other words, the CO 2 adsorbed becomes a trap, which can stabilize the electron for a longer time in the electrode before it can be transferred.According to Kharade and Chang (2020), this stabilization can occur via hydroxyl groups on the surface of the amorphous TiO 2 that can act as a trap for CO 2 forming carbonate species, increasing CO 2 chemisorption.Therefore, herein the scan rate becomes an important parameter.If the process is slow, more electrons are transferred at lower scan rates.On the other hand, if the process is fast enough, no difference is observed.This factor also may explain why there is no variation of charge in the region i in CO 2 saturated electrolyte (Fig. 5D).Since the CO 2 is adsorbed, the carbonated species formed by chemisorption on the surface act as a trap for electrons, resulting in no variation of the charge in the region i (Fig. 5D). Besides the flat band potential (E fb ), identified as -0.4 V vs. NHE by extrapolation of the linear part of the Mott-Schottky plots (Fig. 6), the charge carriers density (N D ) for the am-TNTA electrode was determined from the Mott-Schottky equation (Hanzu et al., 2011), where the values of 1.2 10 -19 cm -3 and 9.3 10 -19 cm -3 were found for the measurements performed in phosphate buffer solution saturated with N 2 and CO 2 , respectively, assuming a relative permittivity of 55 for TNTA (Raza et al., 2021).These results show that the flat band potential did not change with the CO 2 purge in the electrolyte, but the charge carrier density increased.One hypothesis for the high charge carrier density is the presence of carbonate groups formed on the electrode surface by chemisorption acting like donor group and making the electrons move more freely. The Nyquist plot shows the imaginary part of the complex impedance (-Z ) as a function of the real part (Z ) of the am-TNTA electrode for different frequency values.Fig. S7 (SI file) depicts the impedance spectra for the photocatalyst at -0.2 V, -0.4 V, and -0.6 V vs. NHE.These curves represent the system under three different conditions, i.e., when the applied potential is less negative than the flat band potential (E fb ), equal to E fb , and more negative than E fb .The insets exhibit the highfrequency region, where a semicircle arc is observed in the measurement carried out in electrolyte purge with N 2 at -0.2 V vs. NHE, and its shape is related to the electrolyte resistance (Mei et al., 2018;Freitas et al., 2014).Fig. 7 shows that this semicircle was not observed clearly at more negative potentials or when CO 2 was introduced into the solution. A slight deviation at the low-frequency values was observed with the increase of the solution's resistance in the CO 2 saturated electrolyte.Regarding the different behavior as a function of the applied bias in each case, the change in the semicircle format shows the reduction of the internal resistance (electrode and electrolyte) of the system at more negative potentials. Regarding the N 2 saturation, note in Fig. 7 that the values that close the pseudo-semicircle for each applied potential has the same frequency (398 Hz).This means there is an electron transfer process taking place with that time constant, which charge transfer resistance decreases when the applied potential increase.This happens until it reaches the value of the conduction band, and the transfer from the band takes place.Besides, the frequency of the process (398 Hz 3.98 10 2 s -1 ) is similar to the one reported by Bertoluzzi et al. (5 10 2 s -1 ) (Bertoluzzi and Bisquert, 2012).For the CO 2 saturated electrolyte, the pseudo-semicircle closes at a higher frequency (1000 Hz), which means that it is a faster process overlapping the traps filling, and the electron transfer has a higher resistance. Table 2 shows the capacitance and resistance values obtained fitting the data with a simulated equivalent circuit illustrated in Fig. S7.This circuit was composed of a, b, c circuit parts with resistance and capacitance elements, where R t/d is the trapping/detrapping resistance, C dl is the double-layer capacitance, R t is the resistance of the charge transfer from the trap, C t is the capacitance of the trap, C ct is the capacitance of the charge transfer process from the band, and R ct is the charge transfer resistance from the band. The results from Table 2 showed that the resistance of the trapping/ detrapping (R t/d ) and the capacitance of the double-layer (C dl ) are approximately constant in N 2 saturated electrolyte and presented no significant variation in the CO 2 case, indicating significant changes in the trapping/detrapping mechanism with the applied potential.However, compared with N 2 saturated electrolyte, the resistance (R t/d ) values are higher in CO 2 while C dl values are small.The charge transfer resistance from the traps (R t ) decreases toward more negative potentials as the traps are being filled from the solution with N 2 , but it remained constant in CO 2 solution.The capacitance of the traps (C t ) exhibits a maximum value is at -0.2 V (vs.NHE) in both cases.These values are related to the semicircles from the Nyquist plots.As the overpotential increases (potential become more negative), the resistance of the charge transfer from the traps (R ct ) reduces while the corresponding capacitance (C ct ) increases.This indicates that the accumulation of charge is diminishing toward more negative potentials. These results show that the major effect is the CO 2 on the trap filling resistance.The traps are easily or faster filled when the CO 2 is adsorbed, Fig. 7. Detail of the high-frequency regions of the Nyquist diagrams for am-TNTA film obtained in phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.0) saturated with N 2 (right) and CO 2 (left) at -0.2 V, -0.4 V, and -0.6 V vs. NHE. Capacitance and resistance elements obtained from the simulated equivalent circuit illustrated in Fig. S7 according to the applied bias.which supports the hypothesis that the CO 2 interacts directly with the traps, promoting the charge transfer from these intermediate energy levels. It is important to stress that the electrochemical impedance behavior of TNTA films described in the literature diverges one from another according to the film properties and the experimental conditions used during the measurements.So, there is no expected standardized profile for TNTA in general.Also, it is not usual to perform the analysis in CO 2 saturated electrolyte.This implies that a further systematic study should be performed to a better comprehension of these findings by changing the type of gas purged into the electrolyte, testing other pH solutions, and performing under UV-light light irradiation.Regarding this preliminary set of experiments, these EIS results can be summarized as follows: the processes at the electrode surface are affected by (i) the applied potential (more or less negative than the flat band potential of the material), and by (ii) the type of the adsorbent species since the presence and absence of CO 2 molecules were analyzed.This latter factor is the first evidence about the interaction of CO 2 species with the am-TNTA film. Upon studying the characteristics of the synthesized am-TNTA photocatalyst film, the CO 2 photoreduction experiment in the water vapor at 39 C was conducted under UV light irradiation while the CH 4 production was monitored by GC each 30 min for 4 h.Fig. 8A shows the CO 2 photocatalytic reduction activity of the fresh catalyst.The CH 4 production increased with time at a constant rate of 14.0 0.7 mol g cat -1 h -1 .This is a remarkable result for an amorphous nanostructured thinfilm catalyst produced in a fast one-step synthesis without modification.This enhanced photocatalytic activity can be attributed to the surface defects of the amorphous structure, mainly OH groups acting as electron traps and increasing the electron lifetime, as will be discussed in the sequence. After the first batch of the experiment, the am-TNTA film was removed from the reactor, dried at room temperature, and labeled as 'used-catalyst'.The CO 2 reduction experiment was repeated five times over the used catalyst.The results are depicted in Fig. 8B, which shows the CH 4 production rate in the six consequently runs using the same catalyst.The rate of CH 4 production varied in the range 13.7-14.01mol g cat -1 h -1 .The small and approximately constant error bars demonstrated the high stability of catalyst for CO 2 reduction into methane during six reaction cycles.This stability is similar to those reported for the crystalline TNTA films (Kar et al., 2019) and other TiO 2 -based catalysts like the amorphous TiO 2 NH 2 -MIL-125(Ti) film (Hu et al., 2020) and black titania powders (Yin et al., 2017), which exhibited good reproducibility in consecutive experiments of the CO conversion to CH 4 without no significant reduction of photocatalytic activity during 4-6 reaction cycles. The CH 4 production rate in CO 2 photoreduction reaction with water using different TiO 2 catalysts is shown in Table 3.It is important to stress that a direct comparison is not recommended due to the differences in the light irradiation, photocatalytic experimental conditions, and catalyst form (film and powder); however, these values work as a reference for the CH 4 yield.The average CH 4 production rate of 14.0 mol g cat h -1 obtained in this study for the am-TNTA film can be considered an impressive CH 4 production rate for a pure TiO 2 with no modification, no doping, no other materials added, and no heat treatment.As a reference, it can be seen that the pure anatase TiO 2 powder (commercial Degussa P25) as photocatalyst for CO 2 conversion to methane under UV irradiation exhibited a CH 4 production rate of 4.11 mol g cat -1 h -1 (Lo et al., 2007).Regarding TNTA films, Kar et al. (2019) tunned the type of heat treatment and electrolyte composition to teste anatase, rutile, and anatase/rutile mixtures for CO 2 reduction under solar simulated irradiation obtaining different methane yields.Using their values as a reference, the CH 4 production rate for the am-TNTA under UV irradiation (this work) is more similar to those observed for anatase TNTA under the solar simulated light (Kar et al., 2019).However, the photocatalytic activity of the crystalline TNTA was attributed to the presence of Ti 3 states and oxygen vacancies produced by the annealing treatment used to sensitize the material to visible light.Herein, the photocatalytic activity of the amorphous semiconductor is attributed to the surface defects (OH groups) acting as electron traps for reducing charge recombination.The UV-vis absorption spectrum (Fig. 3) showed that the am-TNTA can absorb partially under visible light irradiation, demonstrating that the material prepared in a one-step synthetic route also has the potential to convert CO 2 to CH 4 under solar simulated light. A possible reaction pathway for CO 2 conversion to CH 4 occurring at the am-TNTA film surface is illustrated in Fig. 9.The position of the conduction band (-0.4 V vs. NHE) was determined by Mott-Schottky analysis, and the position of the valence band (2.7 V vs. NHE) was calculated from the bandgap (3.10 eV) obtained by the Tauc plot (Fig. 3).This indicates that the counter-reaction taking place to compensate the photogenerated holes is most likely the oxidation of water to produce O 2 (Bolts and Wrighton, 1976;Al Jitan et al., 2020).spectra exhibit a similar profile, with slight changes.It is important to stress the Ti substrate naturally oxide in the air forming a thin TiO 2 layer in the nanometer range.Due to this thin TiO 2 layer covering the bare Ti, a similar profile between Ti substrate and am-TNTA was expected, except for the bonds involving N, C, and F adsorbed from the electrolyte during the synthesis.Notably, the three spectra exhibit a wide broadband from 2700 to 3700 cm -1 indicating the presence of hydroxyl groups (Erdem et al., 2001).Amino groups are generally detected in this interval; however, the hydroxyl broadband could hide them.Therefore, the identification of the N-H bond in this region is inconclusive.Nonetheless, the low-intensity bands in 1070 and 1442 cm -1 in the am-TNTA fresh are attributed to N-Ti-O stretching vibration and N-H stretching vibration, respectively (Li et al., 2014), indicating some N atoms incorporated into the TiO 2 structure.These bands are not observed in am-TNTA used, suggesting an N leaching from the film.The bending vibration of the O-H bond is observed in 1654, 1632, and cm -1 for Ti substrate, am-TNTA fresh, and am-TNTA used. The low-intensity bands observed in 2114-2200 cm -1 interval in the am-TNTA used might be associated with carbonate/carboxylate species generated by interaction with the catalyst, as proposed by Neat u et al., 2014).However, these bands are also observed with lower intensity in Ti substrate, which might indicate carbonyl groups absorbed from the air over the metallic substrate.Bands at 873 and 888 cm -1 observed in Ti substrate and am-TNTA used are assigned to Ti-O stretching bands.In the FTIR spectra of the am-TNTA fresh, this band is overlapped by another broadband in 700-900 cm -1 interval with a maximum at cm -1 that can be attributed to carbon skeleton vibrations of the ethylene glycol (Leon et al., 2017) incorporated from the electrolyte into TNTA surface that could leach the film after use. The am-TNTA stability before and after recycling was evaluated by FTIR, XPS, and PL techniques.The spectra for the fresh and used catalyst are shown in Fig. S8.As discussed in Section 3.1, the Ti 2p spectrum of the fresh catalyst corresponds to the chemical state Ti 4 .The relative intensity and position of the peaks remained unchanged in the used catalyst XPS spectrum (Fig. S8-B).The XPS spectrum of O 1s (Fig. S8 C-D) revealed the presence of hydroxyl groups or water (Hao et al., 2019).The relative intensity of these peaks is almost constant in the used catalyst.The C 1s spectra (Fig. S8 E-F) indicates peaks related to C-C, C-O, and COOH (Zaleska et al., 2008), originating from the Ethylene glycol used in the preparation of the am-TNTA film.Notably, no heat treatment was done on the synthesized catalyst.However, the relative intensity of the C 1s spectrum remains almost constant in the used catalyst compared to the fresh catalyst, which is in agreement with the photocatalytic reduction results confirming that the produced methane is not originated from this carbon source but CO 2 .The XPS wide spectrum (Fig. S8 G-H) also shows the presence of a small amount of F and N, which are originated from the NH 4 F salt employed in the synthesis of the am-TNTA film. The PL spectra of fresh and used catalysts until the fourth cycle are illustrated in Fig. 11.The emission spectra were collected with excitation at 325 nm wavelength and revealed that the am-TNTA does not present a broadband emission, but several peaks in the whole range of wavelength, indicating multiphononic processes.This behavior, observed for the fresh and used catalyst, was reported in other studies from the literature (Bavykin et al., 2005;Vijayan et al., 2012).In the PL properties of colloidal TiO 2 nanotubes produced by the alkali hydrothermal method (Bavykin et al., 2005), many sharp peaks were observed in the 300-700 nm range.The authors attributed the sharp bands to the low energy states as residual cations incorporated in the material during the synthesis.A similar feature was reported for TiO 2 nanotubes and carbon nanotubes composites (Vijayan et al., 2012).Usually, these sharp bands in PL spectra of semiconductors are attributed to transitions involving impurities states, doping, and the existence of trap states in bandgap promoted by defects.In other PL spectra of TNTA films, broadbands emission was observed and deconvoluted into many emission peaks in the whole range of emission wavelength (Siuzdak et al. 2015a(Siuzdak et al. , 2015b)).The authors suggested that the presence of several peaks in the PL spectrum of TiO 2 nanotubes could have resulted from the existence of sub-bandgap states in the complex structure of nanotubes (Siuzdak et al., 2015b). This behavior implies that several paths for the emission due to the high density of electronic states caused by defects (Mendez-Galvan et al., 2021).These peaks confirm the presence of many deep and shallow surface states, which could enhance the separation of electron/hole pairs and decrease the recombination rate of photoexcited charge carriers (Wang et al., 2018).These defects can be promoted by different oxygen defects like mono-ionized oxygen vacancies (shallow defects) and double-ionized oxygen vacancies (deep defects) formed as a consequence of doping/modification or heat treatment, or they can be caused by hydroxyl/water groups which can trap the electrons and act as shallow acceptor levels (Kharade and Chang, 2020;Mendez-Galvan et al., 2021).For the am-TNTA film, FTIR, XPS, and EIS results evidence that these defects are probably caused by the hydroxyl groups acting as a trap for the CO 2 via formation of carbonate species.On the other hand, the results showed a small absorption of the am-TNTA in the visible light region (Fig. 3) that can be attributed to N incorporated into the film during the synthesis, as suggested by other authors (Li et al., 2010), which can act as impurities in the synthesized material, creating sub-bandgap states. Regarding the intensity of the emission peak, some factors might be contributed to a low emission peak of the am-TNTA film.Since the film was grown on a titanium conductive substrate, the separation of charge carriers due to the transfer of electrons to the conductive substrate could suppress the intensity of PL emission.Another factor is the amorphous character of the am-TNTA.Crystalline semiconductors are expected to exhibit high intensity PL due to their low recombination radioactive when compared with the amorphous. Furthermore, the PL spectra of the used catalyst slightly declined when compared to the fresh catalyst.This minor decrease could result from the adsorption of either reactants or products on the catalyst.Stevanovic et al. (2012) studied the effect of several adsorbed molecules on the PL spectrum of TiO 2 .They found that adsorption of either electron donor or electron acceptor species decreases the PL intensity of the TiO 2 catalyst.The reduction in the PL intensity was related to the band bending and formation of the depletion layer.However, the reduction in the PL intensity in Fig. 11 is insignificant, which agrees with the catalyst stability for methane formation in the repeated experiments. In correspondence to the PL analysis, the C 1s spectrum of XPS (Fig. S8 E-F) does not indicate any noticeable change in the amount of carbon on the catalyst surface.Also, the presence of the irreversible adsorbed oxygenated intermediates or products on the surface of the film should change the O 1s XPS high-resolution spectrum, which has remained almost unchanged in the used catalyst compared to the fresh catalyst.Therefore, the prepared am-TNTA film is highly stable for CO 2 photocatalytic reduction. It is important to discuss some aspects about the findings correlating all data.The results show that photocatalytic activity of the am-TNTA film in the CO 2 reduction to CH 4 can be explained in terms of defects caused by the surface hydroxyl species.Traps are electronic energy levels located in the bandgap of a semiconductor and are involved in the charge-transfer process (Wang et al., 2001).It includes surface states, oxygen vacancies, adsorbed species.Shallow defects are energetically closed to CB or VB, whereas deep defects are energetically closed to the Fermi level (Mendez-Galvan et al., 2021).A nanostructured morphology like the TNTA presents a large number of electron traps at the surface and the grain boundaries, influencing the interfacial kinetics of the transfer processes.The detrapping is possible for these shallow traps, but the deep (bulk) traps can immobilize carriers irreversibly (Wehrenfennig et al., 2015), compromising the charge transfer processes.This is the main reason for the short anodizing time chosen in the synthesis in this study.A longer anodizing time would produce a longer nanotube length, where the light could penetrate deeply, reaching the bulk traps and, consequently, reducing the efficiency of the photocatalytic process. Among these defects, Ti 3 surface states, mono-ionized oxygen vacancies (shallow traps), and doubled-ionized oxygen vacancies (deep traps) were not evidenced in this study.On the other hand, the presence of surface hydroxyl groups was evidenced by FTIR and XPS analysis of am-TNTA film.Hydroxyl groups are considered dominant sites for trapping electrons acting as shallow acceptor levels (Mendez-Galvan et al., 2021).PL spectra (Fig. 11) showed many states attributed to shallow defects that can be promoted by these hydroxyl/water groups.In the case of CO 2 photoreduction, the hydroxyl groups act like traps via formation of the carbonate species (Kharade and Chang, 2020), as suggested by the analysis of the electrochemical data.Therefore, since CO 2 interacts directly with the traps, forming carbonate species, we can assume that, in the am-TNTA film, the charge is transferred directly from these shallow levels.To evaluate the effect of the deep defects of am-TNTA film on the photocatalytic activity in CO 2 reduction, further studies are necessary by fabricating the am-TNTA with different thicknesses, nanotube diameter, and nanotube walls.This study will also be important to verify if the charge carriers from different trap states are homogeneously distributed along the nanotube length and diameter.The effect of these defects on the selectivity towards specific products also should be addressed. The main consequence of these traps is the increase of the electron lifetime, favoring the photocatalytic activity of the am-TNTA and preventing them from charge recombination.The recombination of charge carriers (electron/hole pairs) is a major challenge in developing an efficient photocatalyst.The lifetime of photoexcited electrons and holes is estimated to be in the order of 10 -9 s, while the CO 2 reduction reaction requires a longer time (Fan et al., 2013).Therefore, any change which could decrease the recombination rate of electrons and holes will significantly improve the photocatalytic reduction efficiency.Moreover, metals generally have lower Fermi energies than semiconductors which implies that electrons transfer from the semiconductor to the metal.This flow of electrons will lead to the formation of the Schottky barrier at the interface of the conductor/semiconductor that functions as an effective electron trap.Consequently, the formation of the Schottky barrier will increase the lifetime of the excited electrons, which is essential for developing an efficient photocatalyst (Khan et al., 2015).However, it is important to stress that the charge transfer processes in the amorphous material are not faster as the crystalline TiO 2 .Therefore, this is a factor that also should be addressed in the development of the catalyst."}, {"llm generation": "am-TNTA catalyst", "source": "Fig. 10 depicts the FTIR spectra of the Ti substrate and the am-TNTA catalyst performed before and after the first reaction cycle.", "context": "This study evaluated the efficiency and stability of am-TNTA film in CO 2 photoreduction reaction with water to produce methane.The catalyst was fabricated in a one-step procedure without annealing, and it was used as anodized.A shorter anodizing time was chosen to produce a thinner and defective nanotubular titania film (3.7 m thick).Under these conditions, the time of preparation was reduced drastically.The CO 2 reduction reaction with water to methane was carried out under UV light irradiation and presented a CH 4 production rate of 14.0 0.7 mol g cat -1 h -1 , a remarkable photocatalytic activity for an amorphous titania-based material without any modification procedure.After the reaction, the catalyst was dried and reused to evaluate the stability of the nanostructure material.The XPS and PL spectra of the anodized material obtained before and after the experiments demonstrated high stability. The notable result can be explained by the nature of its nanostructure morphology combined with a large number of traps on its surface.The results indicate that those traps are caused by surface hydroxyl groups forming carbonate species which could increase the electron lifetime favoring the CO 2 reduction reaction.This first set of experiments shows that this anodized material is a potential candidate for a sustainable CO 2 reduction process.However, additional studies are required to comprehend the mechanism of the CO 2 conversion to methane under this support and the relation among its morphology, surface defects, and efficiency.Modifications in the material that does not involve annealing step should also be addressed.

A Ti plate, grade 1, 99.6, 1 mm thick (Goodfellow Cambridge Ltd.) was used as substrate and cut in pieces with 3 1 cm or 3 0.7 cm dimensions.Prior to the anodization, the specimens were mechanically polished on each face and washed with deionized water.A cleaning procedure was performed by immersion in a 10 wt.HCl solution under sonication for 10 min, followed by immersion in deionized (DI) water under sonication for 5 min and by immersion in ethanol 96 under sonification for 5 min.The samples were dried in the air. The film was grown on Ti substrate at 50 V for 30 min in ethylene glycol solution containing 10 vol.DI water and 0.75 wt.NH 4 F at room temperature.The short anodizing time was chosen to produce a thinner film since only the outermost surface layer of the catalyst was considered active for the CO 2 reduction.The Ti electrode was immersed into the electrolyte in the center of a 100 mL beaker and connected to a DC Power supply (Nice-power R-SPS3010).Fig. S1 in the Supporting Information depicts a schematic illustration of the anodization system.A stainless-steel foil wrapped into the inner part of the beaker wall was used as a counter-electrode.40 mL of electrolyte was used in the experiments.After the anodization, the sample, labeled as am-TNTA, was washed with DI water and dried in the air.Since different anodized areas were requested for the material characterization, the experiment was repeated under the exact same conditions, except for the Ti area exposed to the electrolyte, resulting in samples with a total anodized area of 0.9, 2.3, and 5.4 cm 2 approximately (Fig. S2).To ensure that the properties of each sample were reproducible, the current-time profile registered during the anodization was monitored and compared.The current density vs. time plots showed the samples were equivalents (Fig. S3).The samples were utilized as anodized without further treatment, with the am-TNTA thin film supported over the Ti substrate.Under the anodizing conditions applied, the oxide is considered amorphous (Indira et al., 2015;Santos et al., 2021).Therefore, no heat treatment was carried out since crystallization was not necessary. The morphology and composition of the am-TNTA films were obtained by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Energy Dispersive Xray Spectroscopy (EDX) using an AMICUS photoelectron spectrometer with an Mg K X-ray source controlled by KRATOS VISION2 software at 20 mA and 10 keV.The binding energy value was calibrated by the C 1s peak at 284.6 eV, Ti 2p and O 1s peaks were observed at 455-470 eV and 525-540 eV, respectively.The analysis of the morphological parameters was carried out by ImageJ software (Rasband, 1997(Rasband, -2018)).The microstructures of the am-TNTA film, titanium substrate, and an annealed TNTA sample used as reference are determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD).The analysis of the amorphous film was performed in Rigaku TTRAX III diffractometer with a Cu K 1 (1.544 A) irradiation.The analysis of the titanium substrate and the annealed film was performed using a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer with a Cu K 1 (1.544 A) irradiation.The chemical bond properties of the Ti substrate and the am-TNTA before and after use were accomplished by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR; Thermo Nicolet 6700). The optical properties of am-TNTA film were analyzed by UV-Vis spectrophotometer using a Agilent Cary 5000 spectrophotometer with wavelengths varying between 200 and 1000 nm range.The bandgap was calculated from UV-Vis data using Tauc's equation (Bharti et al., 2016).Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy technique was applied to investigate electronic properties of the films using a Horiba 4P-Fluoromax spectrofluorometer with a Xenon lamp as the excitation source and an excitation wavelength of 325 nm at room temperature.X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement was carried out by using Axis Supra spectrometer (Kratos) using Mg K X-ray radiation (1253.6 eV) and Al K X-ray radiation (1486.6 eV) at a voltage of 15 kV and current of 12 mA. Electrochemical experiments were performed in a 3-electrode configuration cell.Ti plates with an anodized area of 2.3 cm 2 forming the am-TNTA coating (1.0 1.0 0.1 cm dimensions) were used as working electrodes.A Platinized Ti mesh was used as counter-electrode, and an electrode of Ag/AgCl in 3.0 M KCl was used as reference electrode (Metrohm).The measurements were carried out in a 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.0) saturated with N 2 or CO 2 at room temperature.Before each set of experiments, the solution was purged with N 2 or CO 2 for 30 min and sealed.Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed at different potentials using a Multi Autolab/M204 potentiostat (Metrohm).For EIS measurements, a sinusoidal AC perturbation of 10 mV was applied to the electrodes in the frequency range from 1 10 -2 to 1 10 4 Hz.The Mott-Schottky plots were obtained by measuring the impedance at a constant frequency of 1 kHz at different potentials. The CO 2 photocatalytic reduction experiments were conducted in a three-way quartz reactor (250 mL) placed inside a box containing six UV lamps.The inner walls of the box were covered with aluminum foils.Initially, the reactor was charged with 100 mL deionized water, as illustrated in Fig. S6.The am-TNTA film was held in the headspace of the reactor, which was leak-proof using a rubber septum, at a distance of cm between the bottom of the catalyst sample and the water surface.Then, CO 2 was injected in the DI water in the reactor for 30 min followed by keeping the reactor in the darkness for another 30 min.In every batch, the composition of the gas in the headspace just before light irradiation was measured by a gas chromatograph, and no methane was detected, confirming that the catalyst is inactive in the absence of irradiation.To assure that all the methane was derived only from the CO reduction, multiple tests either without CO 2 injection or placing the catalyst in the reactor were conducted, and no CH 4 was detected.For the light source, 6 UV-light bulbs (Philips Germicidal Ozone UV Quartz Glass UVC Bulb 16 W) were used.The lamps were installed at a distance of 1 cm around the reactor.The duration of each experiment was 4 h, and aliquots were taken each 30 min interval. The concentration of CH 4 was measured in the experiments using a GC-FID (Shimadzu, GC-14A) with the following conditions: packed column: Shincarbon ST, Carrier gas: He (HP grade, 99.99 vol., Makeup gas: air (UHP grade, 100 vol.), column temperature: 70 C, injector temperature: 150 C, detector temperature: 150 C, analysis time: min.After the first run, the am-TNTA film was removed from the reactor, dried at room temperature, and labeled as 'used-catalyst'.The CO 2 reduction experiment was repeated five times over the used catalyst for evaluation of the catalyst stability.The GC-FID reports of controlled experiments made for verify the source of C as unique from CO 2 were exhibited in Fig. S8."}, {"llm generation": "UV", "source": "This implies that a further systematic study should be performed to a better comprehension of these findings by changing the type of gas purged into the electrolyte, testing other pH solutions, and performing under UV-light light irradiation.", "context": "The anodization of Titanium and other valve metals is a well-known technique used to produce nanostructured oxide films (Lee et al., 2014;Indira et al., 2015;Trivinho-Strixino et al., 2017).These nanomaterials are extensively explored in numerous applications in energy, biological and environmental fields due to their facile synthesis with environmental-friendly experimental conditions (mild temperature and low-toxicity reagents) and control of morphology, composition, and structure by the synthetic parameters (Santos et al., 2021).Additionally, the resulting oxides coatings exhibit high surface area per volume, chemical stability, and rigid adhesion between metal and oxide layer, avoiding the use of binder agents. The fabrication of the TNTA via the anodization technique consists of three main steps: preparing the metallic substrate, the anodizing, and the heat treatment.For most applications, anodizing and heat treatment require longer times.The anodizing time can vary from 20 min to 24 h (Santos et al., 2021).The production of nanotubes with a large length and high-aspect ratio requires long anodizing times.Besides, to obtain a high-ordered array, two anodization steps might be necessary.The heat treatment is usually performed at 450-600 C for 1-3 h, disregarding the warm-up and cooling steps, which require additional hours. In the Ti anodization, the TNTA films are grown on the surface of Ti substrates by the anodic oxidation of Ti metallic to TiO 2 , usually in organic media containing fluoride ions.The morphology of the nanostructured film is controlled by the anodizing conditions, i. e. the applied voltage, temperature, electrolyte composition, and anodizing time (Trivinho-Strixino et al., 2017).Applied voltage, for instance, tends to influence the nanotube inner diameter, whereas the temperature, water, and fluoride content can affect the dimensions and shape of the nanotube walls.Anodizing time usually influences the nanotube length (Vargas et al., 2019).In this study, considering that only the outermost surface layer of the amorphous catalyst is active for CO 2 photoreduction, the samples were anodizing for 30 min to produce a thinner film.This approach avoids that the light penetrating too deep inside into the am-TNTA film since traps in the bulk of the material can compromise the reduction and oxidation potential of the electrons and holes, inhibiting transport and charge transfer (Baccaro and Gutz, 2018). Therefore, TNTA films were grown over Ti substrate via potentiostatic anodization at 50 V for 30 min in Ethylene glycol media containing 0.75 wt.NH 4 F and 10 vol.Water.The same anodizing conditions (except the anodized area) were used for all the samples used in this study.The current transients were monitored to assure the experiments repeatability and, consequently, the homogeneity of the material properties in the samples with different anodized areas (see SI file for details). Fig. 1A depicts the current density vs. time curve, divided into three typical regions (Ferreira et al., 2019).Region I is characterized by the abrupt drop of the current density in the early stages of the anodization (0-15 s) until reaching a minimum value denoted by point a in the inset of Fig. 1A.This current reduction is promoted by the formation of the compact oxide film, namely barrier oxide, which increases the resistance of the system (Trivinho-Strixino et al., 2017).In region II, nucleation of the nanotubes takes place.Since the formation of open channels in the oxide offers less resistive pathways, the current density rises with the increase of the surface area of the oxide until achieving point b, where the pores achieve their maximum diameter.After this point, the oxide grows in the bottom of the nanotube, that is, into the metal/oxide interface, resulting in the enlargement of the oxide layer and the nanotube length.Simultaneously to the oxide growth reaction, fluoride ions in the electrolytic medium are promoting the dissolution of the oxide via TiF 6 -2 complex formation (Ghicov and Schmuki, 2009).In region III, the oxide formation reaction and dissolution process reach a steady-state resulting in the vertical growth of the nanotubular structure of TiO 2 .The stages of the oxide layer formation over the titanium substrate monitored by the anodization curve (Fig. 1A) are illustrated in Fig. 1B.This schematic illustration shows the steps of titanium anodic oxidation, including the barrier oxide film formation, pores nucleation, and nanotubes growth into the substrate. Fig. 1C shows the nanotubular structure of the am-TNTA surface obtained by SEM.The nanotubes inner diameter presented values in the 80-120 nm range, with an average value of 100 10 nm, wall NT thickness of 26 5 nm, and a void distance between the nanotubes of 12 9 nm.The nanotube length values ranging from 3.4 to 3.9 m were determined from the SEM side view of the sample (Fig. 1D) obtained in different positions.The average thickness of 3.7 0.3 m found is similar to other TNTA films synthesized under similar conditions reported in the literature (Atyaoui et al., 2013;Hao et al., 2019).Table 1 depicts the compositional analysis of the oxide layer obtained by EDX (see the full table in Supporting Information for more details).The semi-quantitative analysis shows Ti and O elements as majority composition, as expected for the TiO 2 layers, with 33.30 At. and 45.25 At., respectively.N, F and C species from the electrolyte composed of NH 4 F and Ethylene glycol were incorporated into the film in minor quantities.The homogenous distribution of the elements along the am-TNTA surface is shown in Fig. S3. The TNTA films produced by the anodization technique under low voltages (10-60 V) are typically amorphous (Simon et al., 2019(Simon et al., , 2021)), although some authors reported traces of the anatase phase in the film synthetized at 40 V in a glycerol-based electrolyte (Macak et al., 2008).Therefore, for a full oxide crystallization, heat treatment in temperatures above 400 C is necessary (Ghicov and Schmuki, 2009;Indira et al., 2015;Santos et al., 2021).In this study, the focus is on evaluating the photocatalytic activity and stability of the amorphous material; then, the TNTA samples were used as anodized.Fig. 2 depicts the diffractograms of the metallic titanium substrate, the am-TNTA sample, and an anodized TNTA sample produced under the exact anodizing conditions, which was annealed at 450 C under air for 2 h at a 7 C min -1 heating rate.After being maintained at 450 C for 2 h in the tube furnace, the sample was cooling down to room temperature naturally. The diffractogram of the metallic Ti exhibits the Bragg peaks of the hexagonal phase according to PDF 00-044-1294 (Sailer and McCarthy, 1993), where the main peak ( 101) is observed at 40.2 .Other characteristic peaks of this metallic phase are (100) at 35.1 , (002) at 38.4 , (102) at 53 , (103) at 70.7 .These peaks are also observed in the pattern of the annealed TNTA, which reveals a mixture of hexagonal Ti and anatase TiO 2 phase, indicating that the X-ray beam reached the substrate during the scan.The main peaks of the anatase phase are indicated in the second diffractogram according to PDF 01-086-1157 (Sanchez et al., 1996), where the most intensity peak ( 101) is observed at 25.3 .Other characteristic peaks of the anatase phase are (004) at 37.9 , (200) at 48 , (105) at 54.0 , and (211) at 55.1 .The diffractogram of the am-TNTA sample was performed using a small scattering angle to minimize the effect of the metallic substrate.Its pattern is characterized by broader low-intensity peaks and a deviation from the baseline at 2 range from 10 to 35 ; a larger deviation at low 2 when compared with the other two diffractograms.The baseline deviation, broader peaks, or absence of peaks are typical for amorphous material since the crystalline materials present a regular and straight baseline, and well-defined and sharp Bragg peaks (Cullity and Stock, 2001).The broader peak around 25 (101), 37 (004), and 48 (200) in the am-TNTA diffractogram may indicate the presence of the anatase phase in a small extension.Different from powders, the crystallographic orientation of the substrate can influence the nucleation of small crystals in films during the oxide growth.However, the quantity is too small to attribute some crystalline character to the material, as reported by other authors (Macak et al., 2008).Therefore, XRD results demonstrate that TNTA without annealing is predominantly amorphous. Fig. 3 depicts the absorption spectrum of the TNTA film, where it can be seen that the semiconductor majority absorbs in the UV spectra range (390 nm).However, a small but significant absorption is also observed in the visible range (400-700 nm).Table 1 showed that am-TNTA film has 9.92 at. of N in its composition incorporated from NH 4 F content in the electrolyte during the anodization.This N content can exert some contribution to the visible light absorption observed for the am-TNTA catalyst.The incorporated nitrogen into am-TNTA, could alter the semiconductor electronic state, creating sub-energetic states (Li et al., 2010) and enhancing its photocatalytic activity under visible light irradiation. The bandgap of 3.10 eV was determined from Tauc plot (Fig. 3 inset), which was calculated using Tauc's equation (h where is the absorption coefficient, h is Planck's constant, is the radiation frequency and is equal to the speed of light in a vacuum (c) divided by the wavelength (), A is the optical constant, E g is the optical band gap, and n was assumed as 0.5 for direct transitions (Nunez et al., 2021).This bandgap value is slightly larger than the 2.84 eV observed for the am-TNTA produced under similar anodizing conditions (Hao et al., 2019), but it is typical for TiO 2 materials (Ge et al., 2016). The XPS technique was employed to analyze the surface chemical state of the synthesized catalyst.Fig. 4A depicts the XPS wide spectrum which shows the presence of Ti, O, C and a small amount of F and N, which are originated from the NH 4 F salt employed in the synthesis of the am-TNTA film.The Ti 2p spectrum (Fig. 4B) shows two peaks positioned at 459.08 eV and 464.82 eV corresponding to Ti 2p 3/2 and Ti 2p 1/2 , respectively, attributed to the chemical state Ti 4 (Mu et al., 2012;Umer et al., 2019).The XPS spectrum of O 1s (Fig. 4C) was deconvoluted into three peaks positioned at 530.30 eV, 531.51 eV, and 533.06 eV.The peak at 530.30 eV corresponds to lattice oxygen (Ti-O bond), while the peaks at 531.51 eV and 533.06 eV correspond to hydroxyl groups or water (Hao et al., 2019).The C 1s high-resolution XPS (Fig. 4D) indicates three peaks related to C-C, C-O, and COOH (Zaleska et al., 2008), originating from the Ethylene glycol used in the preparation of the am-TNTA film. For nanostructure semiconductor electrodes, information about electronic structure can be extracted from the intrinsic semiconductor properties and the transient states of the semiconductor when it interacts with the electrolyte at a given electrode potential (Berger et al., 2012).Therefore, the electrochemical characterization of the am-TNTA was performed in phosphate buffer media by CV and EIS techniques. This approach was used to investigate the electronic properties of the film and the main processes occurring in the oxide surface. Fig. 5 depicts the cyclic voltammograms of the am-TNTA in the -0.9 V to 0.9 V (vs.NHE) potential window obtained at different scan rates in phosphate buffer solution (pH 7) saturated with N 2 and CO 2 from the starting potential of -0.1 V (vs.NHE).Under these conditions, no cathodic peaks were observed during the cathodic scan toward negative potentials.In the reverse scan, an anodic peak was observed around -0.6 V vs. NHE (at 5 mV s -1 ) in the direction of the positive potentials (Fig. 5A).This anodic peak can be attributed to the oxidation of the hydrogen previously adsorbed during water discharge in the cathodic scan or to the detrapping of the electrons that will be discussed in the sequence.This peak shifted to more positive values as the scan rates increased.The current density increased linearly with the scan rate, indicating no diffusional limitations under this condition, which implies that the system is explained by electron transfer kinetics (Bertoluzzi et al., 2013).The voltammograms in Fig. 5B follow the same tendency observed in Fig. 5A, and no significant features were observed in those profiles, except for the increase of the current density at high scan rates for the electrolyte saturated with CO 2 , which may indicate that the CO 2 affect the capacitance of the system. Therefore, for better visualization of these results, the current values were divided by the corresponded scan rate and plotted as a ratio between charge and potential, as shown in Fig. 5C-D.This shape can be interpreted as a relation between the trapping/detrapping process and the electron transfers between the trap and solution (Bertoluzzi et al., 2013).At a first view, when compared these charge/potential profiles (Fig. 5C-D) with CV profiles (Fig. 5A-B), it can be noted that the processes occurring at low scan rate (5 mV s -1 , black line) exhibited the larger variation in the charge/potential ratio, indicating that slow kinetic processes are favored. The plots from Fig. 5C-D depict four regions designated by i, ii, iii, and iv, in which processes can be described as follows: in region i, the traps are being filled as the system advances toward more negative potentials.In region ii, the main process is the electron transfer in the conduction band (CB), as shown by the Mott-Schottky plot in Fig. 6, where the band edge for the electron transfer from/to CB is identified as -0.4 V vs. NHE.From Fig. 5C-D, the fast increase of the charge/potential rate is observed just after this point (-0.4V vs. NHE).In region iii of the anodic scan, the charge transfer processes occurring are originated at the CB.Region iv is characterized by the electron transfer from the trap to the solution as the potential advances toward more positive values. In region iv (Fig. 5C-D), it notes that the electron transfer from the traps is becoming slower due to the adsorption of CO 2 ; in other words, the CO 2 adsorbed becomes a trap, which can stabilize the electron for a longer time in the electrode before it can be transferred.According to Kharade and Chang (2020), this stabilization can occur via hydroxyl groups on the surface of the amorphous TiO 2 that can act as a trap for CO 2 forming carbonate species, increasing CO 2 chemisorption.Therefore, herein the scan rate becomes an important parameter.If the process is slow, more electrons are transferred at lower scan rates.On the other hand, if the process is fast enough, no difference is observed.This factor also may explain why there is no variation of charge in the region i in CO 2 saturated electrolyte (Fig. 5D).Since the CO 2 is adsorbed, the carbonated species formed by chemisorption on the surface act as a trap for electrons, resulting in no variation of the charge in the region i (Fig. 5D). Besides the flat band potential (E fb ), identified as -0.4 V vs. NHE by extrapolation of the linear part of the Mott-Schottky plots (Fig. 6), the charge carriers density (N D ) for the am-TNTA electrode was determined from the Mott-Schottky equation (Hanzu et al., 2011), where the values of 1.2 10 -19 cm -3 and 9.3 10 -19 cm -3 were found for the measurements performed in phosphate buffer solution saturated with N 2 and CO 2 , respectively, assuming a relative permittivity of 55 for TNTA (Raza et al., 2021).These results show that the flat band potential did not change with the CO 2 purge in the electrolyte, but the charge carrier density increased.One hypothesis for the high charge carrier density is the presence of carbonate groups formed on the electrode surface by chemisorption acting like donor group and making the electrons move more freely. The Nyquist plot shows the imaginary part of the complex impedance (-Z ) as a function of the real part (Z ) of the am-TNTA electrode for different frequency values.Fig. S7 (SI file) depicts the impedance spectra for the photocatalyst at -0.2 V, -0.4 V, and -0.6 V vs. NHE.These curves represent the system under three different conditions, i.e., when the applied potential is less negative than the flat band potential (E fb ), equal to E fb , and more negative than E fb .The insets exhibit the highfrequency region, where a semicircle arc is observed in the measurement carried out in electrolyte purge with N 2 at -0.2 V vs. NHE, and its shape is related to the electrolyte resistance (Mei et al., 2018;Freitas et al., 2014).Fig. 7 shows that this semicircle was not observed clearly at more negative potentials or when CO 2 was introduced into the solution. A slight deviation at the low-frequency values was observed with the increase of the solution's resistance in the CO 2 saturated electrolyte.Regarding the different behavior as a function of the applied bias in each case, the change in the semicircle format shows the reduction of the internal resistance (electrode and electrolyte) of the system at more negative potentials. Regarding the N 2 saturation, note in Fig. 7 that the values that close the pseudo-semicircle for each applied potential has the same frequency (398 Hz).This means there is an electron transfer process taking place with that time constant, which charge transfer resistance decreases when the applied potential increase.This happens until it reaches the value of the conduction band, and the transfer from the band takes place.Besides, the frequency of the process (398 Hz 3.98 10 2 s -1 ) is similar to the one reported by Bertoluzzi et al. (5 10 2 s -1 ) (Bertoluzzi and Bisquert, 2012).For the CO 2 saturated electrolyte, the pseudo-semicircle closes at a higher frequency (1000 Hz), which means that it is a faster process overlapping the traps filling, and the electron transfer has a higher resistance. Table 2 shows the capacitance and resistance values obtained fitting the data with a simulated equivalent circuit illustrated in Fig. S7.This circuit was composed of a, b, c circuit parts with resistance and capacitance elements, where R t/d is the trapping/detrapping resistance, C dl is the double-layer capacitance, R t is the resistance of the charge transfer from the trap, C t is the capacitance of the trap, C ct is the capacitance of the charge transfer process from the band, and R ct is the charge transfer resistance from the band. The results from Table 2 showed that the resistance of the trapping/ detrapping (R t/d ) and the capacitance of the double-layer (C dl ) are approximately constant in N 2 saturated electrolyte and presented no significant variation in the CO 2 case, indicating significant changes in the trapping/detrapping mechanism with the applied potential.However, compared with N 2 saturated electrolyte, the resistance (R t/d ) values are higher in CO 2 while C dl values are small.The charge transfer resistance from the traps (R t ) decreases toward more negative potentials as the traps are being filled from the solution with N 2 , but it remained constant in CO 2 solution.The capacitance of the traps (C t ) exhibits a maximum value is at -0.2 V (vs.NHE) in both cases.These values are related to the semicircles from the Nyquist plots.As the overpotential increases (potential become more negative), the resistance of the charge transfer from the traps (R ct ) reduces while the corresponding capacitance (C ct ) increases.This indicates that the accumulation of charge is diminishing toward more negative potentials. These results show that the major effect is the CO 2 on the trap filling resistance.The traps are easily or faster filled when the CO 2 is adsorbed, Fig. 7. Detail of the high-frequency regions of the Nyquist diagrams for am-TNTA film obtained in phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.0) saturated with N 2 (right) and CO 2 (left) at -0.2 V, -0.4 V, and -0.6 V vs. NHE. Capacitance and resistance elements obtained from the simulated equivalent circuit illustrated in Fig. S7 according to the applied bias.which supports the hypothesis that the CO 2 interacts directly with the traps, promoting the charge transfer from these intermediate energy levels. It is important to stress that the electrochemical impedance behavior of TNTA films described in the literature diverges one from another according to the film properties and the experimental conditions used during the measurements.So, there is no expected standardized profile for TNTA in general.Also, it is not usual to perform the analysis in CO 2 saturated electrolyte.This implies that a further systematic study should be performed to a better comprehension of these findings by changing the type of gas purged into the electrolyte, testing other pH solutions, and performing under UV-light light irradiation.Regarding this preliminary set of experiments, these EIS results can be summarized as follows: the processes at the electrode surface are affected by (i) the applied potential (more or less negative than the flat band potential of the material), and by (ii) the type of the adsorbent species since the presence and absence of CO 2 molecules were analyzed.This latter factor is the first evidence about the interaction of CO 2 species with the am-TNTA film. Upon studying the characteristics of the synthesized am-TNTA photocatalyst film, the CO 2 photoreduction experiment in the water vapor at 39 C was conducted under UV light irradiation while the CH 4 production was monitored by GC each 30 min for 4 h.Fig. 8A shows the CO 2 photocatalytic reduction activity of the fresh catalyst.The CH 4 production increased with time at a constant rate of 14.0 0.7 mol g cat -1 h -1 .This is a remarkable result for an amorphous nanostructured thinfilm catalyst produced in a fast one-step synthesis without modification.This enhanced photocatalytic activity can be attributed to the surface defects of the amorphous structure, mainly OH groups acting as electron traps and increasing the electron lifetime, as will be discussed in the sequence. After the first batch of the experiment, the am-TNTA film was removed from the reactor, dried at room temperature, and labeled as 'used-catalyst'.The CO 2 reduction experiment was repeated five times over the used catalyst.The results are depicted in Fig. 8B, which shows the CH 4 production rate in the six consequently runs using the same catalyst.The rate of CH 4 production varied in the range 13.7-14.01mol g cat -1 h -1 .The small and approximately constant error bars demonstrated the high stability of catalyst for CO 2 reduction into methane during six reaction cycles.This stability is similar to those reported for the crystalline TNTA films (Kar et al., 2019) and other TiO 2 -based catalysts like the amorphous TiO 2 NH 2 -MIL-125(Ti) film (Hu et al., 2020) and black titania powders (Yin et al., 2017), which exhibited good reproducibility in consecutive experiments of the CO conversion to CH 4 without no significant reduction of photocatalytic activity during 4-6 reaction cycles. The CH 4 production rate in CO 2 photoreduction reaction with water using different TiO 2 catalysts is shown in Table 3.It is important to stress that a direct comparison is not recommended due to the differences in the light irradiation, photocatalytic experimental conditions, and catalyst form (film and powder); however, these values work as a reference for the CH 4 yield.The average CH 4 production rate of 14.0 mol g cat h -1 obtained in this study for the am-TNTA film can be considered an impressive CH 4 production rate for a pure TiO 2 with no modification, no doping, no other materials added, and no heat treatment.As a reference, it can be seen that the pure anatase TiO 2 powder (commercial Degussa P25) as photocatalyst for CO 2 conversion to methane under UV irradiation exhibited a CH 4 production rate of 4.11 mol g cat -1 h -1 (Lo et al., 2007).Regarding TNTA films, Kar et al. (2019) tunned the type of heat treatment and electrolyte composition to teste anatase, rutile, and anatase/rutile mixtures for CO 2 reduction under solar simulated irradiation obtaining different methane yields.Using their values as a reference, the CH 4 production rate for the am-TNTA under UV irradiation (this work) is more similar to those observed for anatase TNTA under the solar simulated light (Kar et al., 2019).However, the photocatalytic activity of the crystalline TNTA was attributed to the presence of Ti 3 states and oxygen vacancies produced by the annealing treatment used to sensitize the material to visible light.Herein, the photocatalytic activity of the amorphous semiconductor is attributed to the surface defects (OH groups) acting as electron traps for reducing charge recombination.The UV-vis absorption spectrum (Fig. 3) showed that the am-TNTA can absorb partially under visible light irradiation, demonstrating that the material prepared in a one-step synthetic route also has the potential to convert CO 2 to CH 4 under solar simulated light. A possible reaction pathway for CO 2 conversion to CH 4 occurring at the am-TNTA film surface is illustrated in Fig. 9.The position of the conduction band (-0.4 V vs. NHE) was determined by Mott-Schottky analysis, and the position of the valence band (2.7 V vs. NHE) was calculated from the bandgap (3.10 eV) obtained by the Tauc plot (Fig. 3).This indicates that the counter-reaction taking place to compensate the photogenerated holes is most likely the oxidation of water to produce O 2 (Bolts and Wrighton, 1976;Al Jitan et al., 2020).spectra exhibit a similar profile, with slight changes.It is important to stress the Ti substrate naturally oxide in the air forming a thin TiO 2 layer in the nanometer range.Due to this thin TiO 2 layer covering the bare Ti, a similar profile between Ti substrate and am-TNTA was expected, except for the bonds involving N, C, and F adsorbed from the electrolyte during the synthesis.Notably, the three spectra exhibit a wide broadband from 2700 to 3700 cm -1 indicating the presence of hydroxyl groups (Erdem et al., 2001).Amino groups are generally detected in this interval; however, the hydroxyl broadband could hide them.Therefore, the identification of the N-H bond in this region is inconclusive.Nonetheless, the low-intensity bands in 1070 and 1442 cm -1 in the am-TNTA fresh are attributed to N-Ti-O stretching vibration and N-H stretching vibration, respectively (Li et al., 2014), indicating some N atoms incorporated into the TiO 2 structure.These bands are not observed in am-TNTA used, suggesting an N leaching from the film.The bending vibration of the O-H bond is observed in 1654, 1632, and cm -1 for Ti substrate, am-TNTA fresh, and am-TNTA used. The low-intensity bands observed in 2114-2200 cm -1 interval in the am-TNTA used might be associated with carbonate/carboxylate species generated by interaction with the catalyst, as proposed by Neat u et al., 2014).However, these bands are also observed with lower intensity in Ti substrate, which might indicate carbonyl groups absorbed from the air over the metallic substrate.Bands at 873 and 888 cm -1 observed in Ti substrate and am-TNTA used are assigned to Ti-O stretching bands.In the FTIR spectra of the am-TNTA fresh, this band is overlapped by another broadband in 700-900 cm -1 interval with a maximum at cm -1 that can be attributed to carbon skeleton vibrations of the ethylene glycol (Leon et al., 2017) incorporated from the electrolyte into TNTA surface that could leach the film after use. The am-TNTA stability before and after recycling was evaluated by FTIR, XPS, and PL techniques.The spectra for the fresh and used catalyst are shown in Fig. S8.As discussed in Section 3.1, the Ti 2p spectrum of the fresh catalyst corresponds to the chemical state Ti 4 .The relative intensity and position of the peaks remained unchanged in the used catalyst XPS spectrum (Fig. S8-B).The XPS spectrum of O 1s (Fig. S8 C-D) revealed the presence of hydroxyl groups or water (Hao et al., 2019).The relative intensity of these peaks is almost constant in the used catalyst.The C 1s spectra (Fig. S8 E-F) indicates peaks related to C-C, C-O, and COOH (Zaleska et al., 2008), originating from the Ethylene glycol used in the preparation of the am-TNTA film.Notably, no heat treatment was done on the synthesized catalyst.However, the relative intensity of the C 1s spectrum remains almost constant in the used catalyst compared to the fresh catalyst, which is in agreement with the photocatalytic reduction results confirming that the produced methane is not originated from this carbon source but CO 2 .The XPS wide spectrum (Fig. S8 G-H) also shows the presence of a small amount of F and N, which are originated from the NH 4 F salt employed in the synthesis of the am-TNTA film. The PL spectra of fresh and used catalysts until the fourth cycle are illustrated in Fig. 11.The emission spectra were collected with excitation at 325 nm wavelength and revealed that the am-TNTA does not present a broadband emission, but several peaks in the whole range of wavelength, indicating multiphononic processes.This behavior, observed for the fresh and used catalyst, was reported in other studies from the literature (Bavykin et al., 2005;Vijayan et al., 2012).In the PL properties of colloidal TiO 2 nanotubes produced by the alkali hydrothermal method (Bavykin et al., 2005), many sharp peaks were observed in the 300-700 nm range.The authors attributed the sharp bands to the low energy states as residual cations incorporated in the material during the synthesis.A similar feature was reported for TiO 2 nanotubes and carbon nanotubes composites (Vijayan et al., 2012).Usually, these sharp bands in PL spectra of semiconductors are attributed to transitions involving impurities states, doping, and the existence of trap states in bandgap promoted by defects.In other PL spectra of TNTA films, broadbands emission was observed and deconvoluted into many emission peaks in the whole range of emission wavelength (Siuzdak et al. 2015a(Siuzdak et al. , 2015b)).The authors suggested that the presence of several peaks in the PL spectrum of TiO 2 nanotubes could have resulted from the existence of sub-bandgap states in the complex structure of nanotubes (Siuzdak et al., 2015b). This behavior implies that several paths for the emission due to the high density of electronic states caused by defects (Mendez-Galvan et al., 2021).These peaks confirm the presence of many deep and shallow surface states, which could enhance the separation of electron/hole pairs and decrease the recombination rate of photoexcited charge carriers (Wang et al., 2018).These defects can be promoted by different oxygen defects like mono-ionized oxygen vacancies (shallow defects) and double-ionized oxygen vacancies (deep defects) formed as a consequence of doping/modification or heat treatment, or they can be caused by hydroxyl/water groups which can trap the electrons and act as shallow acceptor levels (Kharade and Chang, 2020;Mendez-Galvan et al., 2021).For the am-TNTA film, FTIR, XPS, and EIS results evidence that these defects are probably caused by the hydroxyl groups acting as a trap for the CO 2 via formation of carbonate species.On the other hand, the results showed a small absorption of the am-TNTA in the visible light region (Fig. 3) that can be attributed to N incorporated into the film during the synthesis, as suggested by other authors (Li et al., 2010), which can act as impurities in the synthesized material, creating sub-bandgap states. Regarding the intensity of the emission peak, some factors might be contributed to a low emission peak of the am-TNTA film.Since the film was grown on a titanium conductive substrate, the separation of charge carriers due to the transfer of electrons to the conductive substrate could suppress the intensity of PL emission.Another factor is the amorphous character of the am-TNTA.Crystalline semiconductors are expected to exhibit high intensity PL due to their low recombination radioactive when compared with the amorphous. Furthermore, the PL spectra of the used catalyst slightly declined when compared to the fresh catalyst.This minor decrease could result from the adsorption of either reactants or products on the catalyst.Stevanovic et al. (2012) studied the effect of several adsorbed molecules on the PL spectrum of TiO 2 .They found that adsorption of either electron donor or electron acceptor species decreases the PL intensity of the TiO 2 catalyst.The reduction in the PL intensity was related to the band bending and formation of the depletion layer.However, the reduction in the PL intensity in Fig. 11 is insignificant, which agrees with the catalyst stability for methane formation in the repeated experiments. In correspondence to the PL analysis, the C 1s spectrum of XPS (Fig. S8 E-F) does not indicate any noticeable change in the amount of carbon on the catalyst surface.Also, the presence of the irreversible adsorbed oxygenated intermediates or products on the surface of the film should change the O 1s XPS high-resolution spectrum, which has remained almost unchanged in the used catalyst compared to the fresh catalyst.Therefore, the prepared am-TNTA film is highly stable for CO 2 photocatalytic reduction. It is important to discuss some aspects about the findings correlating all data.The results show that photocatalytic activity of the am-TNTA film in the CO 2 reduction to CH 4 can be explained in terms of defects caused by the surface hydroxyl species.Traps are electronic energy levels located in the bandgap of a semiconductor and are involved in the charge-transfer process (Wang et al., 2001).It includes surface states, oxygen vacancies, adsorbed species.Shallow defects are energetically closed to CB or VB, whereas deep defects are energetically closed to the Fermi level (Mendez-Galvan et al., 2021).A nanostructured morphology like the TNTA presents a large number of electron traps at the surface and the grain boundaries, influencing the interfacial kinetics of the transfer processes.The detrapping is possible for these shallow traps, but the deep (bulk) traps can immobilize carriers irreversibly (Wehrenfennig et al., 2015), compromising the charge transfer processes.This is the main reason for the short anodizing time chosen in the synthesis in this study.A longer anodizing time would produce a longer nanotube length, where the light could penetrate deeply, reaching the bulk traps and, consequently, reducing the efficiency of the photocatalytic process. Among these defects, Ti 3 surface states, mono-ionized oxygen vacancies (shallow traps), and doubled-ionized oxygen vacancies (deep traps) were not evidenced in this study.On the other hand, the presence of surface hydroxyl groups was evidenced by FTIR and XPS analysis of am-TNTA film.Hydroxyl groups are considered dominant sites for trapping electrons acting as shallow acceptor levels (Mendez-Galvan et al., 2021).PL spectra (Fig. 11) showed many states attributed to shallow defects that can be promoted by these hydroxyl/water groups.In the case of CO 2 photoreduction, the hydroxyl groups act like traps via formation of the carbonate species (Kharade and Chang, 2020), as suggested by the analysis of the electrochemical data.Therefore, since CO 2 interacts directly with the traps, forming carbonate species, we can assume that, in the am-TNTA film, the charge is transferred directly from these shallow levels.To evaluate the effect of the deep defects of am-TNTA film on the photocatalytic activity in CO 2 reduction, further studies are necessary by fabricating the am-TNTA with different thicknesses, nanotube diameter, and nanotube walls.This study will also be important to verify if the charge carriers from different trap states are homogeneously distributed along the nanotube length and diameter.The effect of these defects on the selectivity towards specific products also should be addressed. The main consequence of these traps is the increase of the electron lifetime, favoring the photocatalytic activity of the am-TNTA and preventing them from charge recombination.The recombination of charge carriers (electron/hole pairs) is a major challenge in developing an efficient photocatalyst.The lifetime of photoexcited electrons and holes is estimated to be in the order of 10 -9 s, while the CO 2 reduction reaction requires a longer time (Fan et al., 2013).Therefore, any change which could decrease the recombination rate of electrons and holes will significantly improve the photocatalytic reduction efficiency.Moreover, metals generally have lower Fermi energies than semiconductors which implies that electrons transfer from the semiconductor to the metal.This flow of electrons will lead to the formation of the Schottky barrier at the interface of the conductor/semiconductor that functions as an effective electron trap.Consequently, the formation of the Schottky barrier will increase the lifetime of the excited electrons, which is essential for developing an efficient photocatalyst (Khan et al., 2015).However, it is important to stress that the charge transfer processes in the amorphous material are not faster as the crystalline TiO 2 .Therefore, this is a factor that also should be addressed in the development of the catalyst."}, {"llm generation": "UV", "source": "Upon studying the characteristics of the synthesized am-TNTA photocatalyst film, the CO 2 photoreduction experiment in the water vapor at 39 C was conducted under UV light irradiation while the CH 4 production was monitored by GC each 30 min for 4 h.", "context": "The anodization of Titanium and other valve metals is a well-known technique used to produce nanostructured oxide films (Lee et al., 2014;Indira et al., 2015;Trivinho-Strixino et al., 2017).These nanomaterials are extensively explored in numerous applications in energy, biological and environmental fields due to their facile synthesis with environmental-friendly experimental conditions (mild temperature and low-toxicity reagents) and control of morphology, composition, and structure by the synthetic parameters (Santos et al., 2021).Additionally, the resulting oxides coatings exhibit high surface area per volume, chemical stability, and rigid adhesion between metal and oxide layer, avoiding the use of binder agents. The fabrication of the TNTA via the anodization technique consists of three main steps: preparing the metallic substrate, the anodizing, and the heat treatment.For most applications, anodizing and heat treatment require longer times.The anodizing time can vary from 20 min to 24 h (Santos et al., 2021).The production of nanotubes with a large length and high-aspect ratio requires long anodizing times.Besides, to obtain a high-ordered array, two anodization steps might be necessary.The heat treatment is usually performed at 450-600 C for 1-3 h, disregarding the warm-up and cooling steps, which require additional hours. In the Ti anodization, the TNTA films are grown on the surface of Ti substrates by the anodic oxidation of Ti metallic to TiO 2 , usually in organic media containing fluoride ions.The morphology of the nanostructured film is controlled by the anodizing conditions, i. e. the applied voltage, temperature, electrolyte composition, and anodizing time (Trivinho-Strixino et al., 2017).Applied voltage, for instance, tends to influence the nanotube inner diameter, whereas the temperature, water, and fluoride content can affect the dimensions and shape of the nanotube walls.Anodizing time usually influences the nanotube length (Vargas et al., 2019).In this study, considering that only the outermost surface layer of the amorphous catalyst is active for CO 2 photoreduction, the samples were anodizing for 30 min to produce a thinner film.This approach avoids that the light penetrating too deep inside into the am-TNTA film since traps in the bulk of the material can compromise the reduction and oxidation potential of the electrons and holes, inhibiting transport and charge transfer (Baccaro and Gutz, 2018). Therefore, TNTA films were grown over Ti substrate via potentiostatic anodization at 50 V for 30 min in Ethylene glycol media containing 0.75 wt.NH 4 F and 10 vol.Water.The same anodizing conditions (except the anodized area) were used for all the samples used in this study.The current transients were monitored to assure the experiments repeatability and, consequently, the homogeneity of the material properties in the samples with different anodized areas (see SI file for details). Fig. 1A depicts the current density vs. time curve, divided into three typical regions (Ferreira et al., 2019).Region I is characterized by the abrupt drop of the current density in the early stages of the anodization (0-15 s) until reaching a minimum value denoted by point a in the inset of Fig. 1A.This current reduction is promoted by the formation of the compact oxide film, namely barrier oxide, which increases the resistance of the system (Trivinho-Strixino et al., 2017).In region II, nucleation of the nanotubes takes place.Since the formation of open channels in the oxide offers less resistive pathways, the current density rises with the increase of the surface area of the oxide until achieving point b, where the pores achieve their maximum diameter.After this point, the oxide grows in the bottom of the nanotube, that is, into the metal/oxide interface, resulting in the enlargement of the oxide layer and the nanotube length.Simultaneously to the oxide growth reaction, fluoride ions in the electrolytic medium are promoting the dissolution of the oxide via TiF 6 -2 complex formation (Ghicov and Schmuki, 2009).In region III, the oxide formation reaction and dissolution process reach a steady-state resulting in the vertical growth of the nanotubular structure of TiO 2 .The stages of the oxide layer formation over the titanium substrate monitored by the anodization curve (Fig. 1A) are illustrated in Fig. 1B.This schematic illustration shows the steps of titanium anodic oxidation, including the barrier oxide film formation, pores nucleation, and nanotubes growth into the substrate. Fig. 1C shows the nanotubular structure of the am-TNTA surface obtained by SEM.The nanotubes inner diameter presented values in the 80-120 nm range, with an average value of 100 10 nm, wall NT thickness of 26 5 nm, and a void distance between the nanotubes of 12 9 nm.The nanotube length values ranging from 3.4 to 3.9 m were determined from the SEM side view of the sample (Fig. 1D) obtained in different positions.The average thickness of 3.7 0.3 m found is similar to other TNTA films synthesized under similar conditions reported in the literature (Atyaoui et al., 2013;Hao et al., 2019).Table 1 depicts the compositional analysis of the oxide layer obtained by EDX (see the full table in Supporting Information for more details).The semi-quantitative analysis shows Ti and O elements as majority composition, as expected for the TiO 2 layers, with 33.30 At. and 45.25 At., respectively.N, F and C species from the electrolyte composed of NH 4 F and Ethylene glycol were incorporated into the film in minor quantities.The homogenous distribution of the elements along the am-TNTA surface is shown in Fig. S3. The TNTA films produced by the anodization technique under low voltages (10-60 V) are typically amorphous (Simon et al., 2019(Simon et al., , 2021)), although some authors reported traces of the anatase phase in the film synthetized at 40 V in a glycerol-based electrolyte (Macak et al., 2008).Therefore, for a full oxide crystallization, heat treatment in temperatures above 400 C is necessary (Ghicov and Schmuki, 2009;Indira et al., 2015;Santos et al., 2021).In this study, the focus is on evaluating the photocatalytic activity and stability of the amorphous material; then, the TNTA samples were used as anodized.Fig. 2 depicts the diffractograms of the metallic titanium substrate, the am-TNTA sample, and an anodized TNTA sample produced under the exact anodizing conditions, which was annealed at 450 C under air for 2 h at a 7 C min -1 heating rate.After being maintained at 450 C for 2 h in the tube furnace, the sample was cooling down to room temperature naturally. The diffractogram of the metallic Ti exhibits the Bragg peaks of the hexagonal phase according to PDF 00-044-1294 (Sailer and McCarthy, 1993), where the main peak ( 101) is observed at 40.2 .Other characteristic peaks of this metallic phase are (100) at 35.1 , (002) at 38.4 , (102) at 53 , (103) at 70.7 .These peaks are also observed in the pattern of the annealed TNTA, which reveals a mixture of hexagonal Ti and anatase TiO 2 phase, indicating that the X-ray beam reached the substrate during the scan.The main peaks of the anatase phase are indicated in the second diffractogram according to PDF 01-086-1157 (Sanchez et al., 1996), where the most intensity peak ( 101) is observed at 25.3 .Other characteristic peaks of the anatase phase are (004) at 37.9 , (200) at 48 , (105) at 54.0 , and (211) at 55.1 .The diffractogram of the am-TNTA sample was performed using a small scattering angle to minimize the effect of the metallic substrate.Its pattern is characterized by broader low-intensity peaks and a deviation from the baseline at 2 range from 10 to 35 ; a larger deviation at low 2 when compared with the other two diffractograms.The baseline deviation, broader peaks, or absence of peaks are typical for amorphous material since the crystalline materials present a regular and straight baseline, and well-defined and sharp Bragg peaks (Cullity and Stock, 2001).The broader peak around 25 (101), 37 (004), and 48 (200) in the am-TNTA diffractogram may indicate the presence of the anatase phase in a small extension.Different from powders, the crystallographic orientation of the substrate can influence the nucleation of small crystals in films during the oxide growth.However, the quantity is too small to attribute some crystalline character to the material, as reported by other authors (Macak et al., 2008).Therefore, XRD results demonstrate that TNTA without annealing is predominantly amorphous. Fig. 3 depicts the absorption spectrum of the TNTA film, where it can be seen that the semiconductor majority absorbs in the UV spectra range (390 nm).However, a small but significant absorption is also observed in the visible range (400-700 nm).Table 1 showed that am-TNTA film has 9.92 at. of N in its composition incorporated from NH 4 F content in the electrolyte during the anodization.This N content can exert some contribution to the visible light absorption observed for the am-TNTA catalyst.The incorporated nitrogen into am-TNTA, could alter the semiconductor electronic state, creating sub-energetic states (Li et al., 2010) and enhancing its photocatalytic activity under visible light irradiation. The bandgap of 3.10 eV was determined from Tauc plot (Fig. 3 inset), which was calculated using Tauc's equation (h where is the absorption coefficient, h is Planck's constant, is the radiation frequency and is equal to the speed of light in a vacuum (c) divided by the wavelength (), A is the optical constant, E g is the optical band gap, and n was assumed as 0.5 for direct transitions (Nunez et al., 2021).This bandgap value is slightly larger than the 2.84 eV observed for the am-TNTA produced under similar anodizing conditions (Hao et al., 2019), but it is typical for TiO 2 materials (Ge et al., 2016). The XPS technique was employed to analyze the surface chemical state of the synthesized catalyst.Fig. 4A depicts the XPS wide spectrum which shows the presence of Ti, O, C and a small amount of F and N, which are originated from the NH 4 F salt employed in the synthesis of the am-TNTA film.The Ti 2p spectrum (Fig. 4B) shows two peaks positioned at 459.08 eV and 464.82 eV corresponding to Ti 2p 3/2 and Ti 2p 1/2 , respectively, attributed to the chemical state Ti 4 (Mu et al., 2012;Umer et al., 2019).The XPS spectrum of O 1s (Fig. 4C) was deconvoluted into three peaks positioned at 530.30 eV, 531.51 eV, and 533.06 eV.The peak at 530.30 eV corresponds to lattice oxygen (Ti-O bond), while the peaks at 531.51 eV and 533.06 eV correspond to hydroxyl groups or water (Hao et al., 2019).The C 1s high-resolution XPS (Fig. 4D) indicates three peaks related to C-C, C-O, and COOH (Zaleska et al., 2008), originating from the Ethylene glycol used in the preparation of the am-TNTA film. For nanostructure semiconductor electrodes, information about electronic structure can be extracted from the intrinsic semiconductor properties and the transient states of the semiconductor when it interacts with the electrolyte at a given electrode potential (Berger et al., 2012).Therefore, the electrochemical characterization of the am-TNTA was performed in phosphate buffer media by CV and EIS techniques. This approach was used to investigate the electronic properties of the film and the main processes occurring in the oxide surface. Fig. 5 depicts the cyclic voltammograms of the am-TNTA in the -0.9 V to 0.9 V (vs.NHE) potential window obtained at different scan rates in phosphate buffer solution (pH 7) saturated with N 2 and CO 2 from the starting potential of -0.1 V (vs.NHE).Under these conditions, no cathodic peaks were observed during the cathodic scan toward negative potentials.In the reverse scan, an anodic peak was observed around -0.6 V vs. NHE (at 5 mV s -1 ) in the direction of the positive potentials (Fig. 5A).This anodic peak can be attributed to the oxidation of the hydrogen previously adsorbed during water discharge in the cathodic scan or to the detrapping of the electrons that will be discussed in the sequence.This peak shifted to more positive values as the scan rates increased.The current density increased linearly with the scan rate, indicating no diffusional limitations under this condition, which implies that the system is explained by electron transfer kinetics (Bertoluzzi et al., 2013).The voltammograms in Fig. 5B follow the same tendency observed in Fig. 5A, and no significant features were observed in those profiles, except for the increase of the current density at high scan rates for the electrolyte saturated with CO 2 , which may indicate that the CO 2 affect the capacitance of the system. Therefore, for better visualization of these results, the current values were divided by the corresponded scan rate and plotted as a ratio between charge and potential, as shown in Fig. 5C-D.This shape can be interpreted as a relation between the trapping/detrapping process and the electron transfers between the trap and solution (Bertoluzzi et al., 2013).At a first view, when compared these charge/potential profiles (Fig. 5C-D) with CV profiles (Fig. 5A-B), it can be noted that the processes occurring at low scan rate (5 mV s -1 , black line) exhibited the larger variation in the charge/potential ratio, indicating that slow kinetic processes are favored. The plots from Fig. 5C-D depict four regions designated by i, ii, iii, and iv, in which processes can be described as follows: in region i, the traps are being filled as the system advances toward more negative potentials.In region ii, the main process is the electron transfer in the conduction band (CB), as shown by the Mott-Schottky plot in Fig. 6, where the band edge for the electron transfer from/to CB is identified as -0.4 V vs. NHE.From Fig. 5C-D, the fast increase of the charge/potential rate is observed just after this point (-0.4V vs. NHE).In region iii of the anodic scan, the charge transfer processes occurring are originated at the CB.Region iv is characterized by the electron transfer from the trap to the solution as the potential advances toward more positive values. In region iv (Fig. 5C-D), it notes that the electron transfer from the traps is becoming slower due to the adsorption of CO 2 ; in other words, the CO 2 adsorbed becomes a trap, which can stabilize the electron for a longer time in the electrode before it can be transferred.According to Kharade and Chang (2020), this stabilization can occur via hydroxyl groups on the surface of the amorphous TiO 2 that can act as a trap for CO 2 forming carbonate species, increasing CO 2 chemisorption.Therefore, herein the scan rate becomes an important parameter.If the process is slow, more electrons are transferred at lower scan rates.On the other hand, if the process is fast enough, no difference is observed.This factor also may explain why there is no variation of charge in the region i in CO 2 saturated electrolyte (Fig. 5D).Since the CO 2 is adsorbed, the carbonated species formed by chemisorption on the surface act as a trap for electrons, resulting in no variation of the charge in the region i (Fig. 5D). Besides the flat band potential (E fb ), identified as -0.4 V vs. NHE by extrapolation of the linear part of the Mott-Schottky plots (Fig. 6), the charge carriers density (N D ) for the am-TNTA electrode was determined from the Mott-Schottky equation (Hanzu et al., 2011), where the values of 1.2 10 -19 cm -3 and 9.3 10 -19 cm -3 were found for the measurements performed in phosphate buffer solution saturated with N 2 and CO 2 , respectively, assuming a relative permittivity of 55 for TNTA (Raza et al., 2021).These results show that the flat band potential did not change with the CO 2 purge in the electrolyte, but the charge carrier density increased.One hypothesis for the high charge carrier density is the presence of carbonate groups formed on the electrode surface by chemisorption acting like donor group and making the electrons move more freely. The Nyquist plot shows the imaginary part of the complex impedance (-Z ) as a function of the real part (Z ) of the am-TNTA electrode for different frequency values.Fig. S7 (SI file) depicts the impedance spectra for the photocatalyst at -0.2 V, -0.4 V, and -0.6 V vs. NHE.These curves represent the system under three different conditions, i.e., when the applied potential is less negative than the flat band potential (E fb ), equal to E fb , and more negative than E fb .The insets exhibit the highfrequency region, where a semicircle arc is observed in the measurement carried out in electrolyte purge with N 2 at -0.2 V vs. NHE, and its shape is related to the electrolyte resistance (Mei et al., 2018;Freitas et al., 2014).Fig. 7 shows that this semicircle was not observed clearly at more negative potentials or when CO 2 was introduced into the solution. A slight deviation at the low-frequency values was observed with the increase of the solution's resistance in the CO 2 saturated electrolyte.Regarding the different behavior as a function of the applied bias in each case, the change in the semicircle format shows the reduction of the internal resistance (electrode and electrolyte) of the system at more negative potentials. Regarding the N 2 saturation, note in Fig. 7 that the values that close the pseudo-semicircle for each applied potential has the same frequency (398 Hz).This means there is an electron transfer process taking place with that time constant, which charge transfer resistance decreases when the applied potential increase.This happens until it reaches the value of the conduction band, and the transfer from the band takes place.Besides, the frequency of the process (398 Hz 3.98 10 2 s -1 ) is similar to the one reported by Bertoluzzi et al. (5 10 2 s -1 ) (Bertoluzzi and Bisquert, 2012).For the CO 2 saturated electrolyte, the pseudo-semicircle closes at a higher frequency (1000 Hz), which means that it is a faster process overlapping the traps filling, and the electron transfer has a higher resistance. Table 2 shows the capacitance and resistance values obtained fitting the data with a simulated equivalent circuit illustrated in Fig. S7.This circuit was composed of a, b, c circuit parts with resistance and capacitance elements, where R t/d is the trapping/detrapping resistance, C dl is the double-layer capacitance, R t is the resistance of the charge transfer from the trap, C t is the capacitance of the trap, C ct is the capacitance of the charge transfer process from the band, and R ct is the charge transfer resistance from the band. The results from Table 2 showed that the resistance of the trapping/ detrapping (R t/d ) and the capacitance of the double-layer (C dl ) are approximately constant in N 2 saturated electrolyte and presented no significant variation in the CO 2 case, indicating significant changes in the trapping/detrapping mechanism with the applied potential.However, compared with N 2 saturated electrolyte, the resistance (R t/d ) values are higher in CO 2 while C dl values are small.The charge transfer resistance from the traps (R t ) decreases toward more negative potentials as the traps are being filled from the solution with N 2 , but it remained constant in CO 2 solution.The capacitance of the traps (C t ) exhibits a maximum value is at -0.2 V (vs.NHE) in both cases.These values are related to the semicircles from the Nyquist plots.As the overpotential increases (potential become more negative), the resistance of the charge transfer from the traps (R ct ) reduces while the corresponding capacitance (C ct ) increases.This indicates that the accumulation of charge is diminishing toward more negative potentials. These results show that the major effect is the CO 2 on the trap filling resistance.The traps are easily or faster filled when the CO 2 is adsorbed, Fig. 7. Detail of the high-frequency regions of the Nyquist diagrams for am-TNTA film obtained in phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.0) saturated with N 2 (right) and CO 2 (left) at -0.2 V, -0.4 V, and -0.6 V vs. NHE. Capacitance and resistance elements obtained from the simulated equivalent circuit illustrated in Fig. S7 according to the applied bias.which supports the hypothesis that the CO 2 interacts directly with the traps, promoting the charge transfer from these intermediate energy levels. It is important to stress that the electrochemical impedance behavior of TNTA films described in the literature diverges one from another according to the film properties and the experimental conditions used during the measurements.So, there is no expected standardized profile for TNTA in general.Also, it is not usual to perform the analysis in CO 2 saturated electrolyte.This implies that a further systematic study should be performed to a better comprehension of these findings by changing the type of gas purged into the electrolyte, testing other pH solutions, and performing under UV-light light irradiation.Regarding this preliminary set of experiments, these EIS results can be summarized as follows: the processes at the electrode surface are affected by (i) the applied potential (more or less negative than the flat band potential of the material), and by (ii) the type of the adsorbent species since the presence and absence of CO 2 molecules were analyzed.This latter factor is the first evidence about the interaction of CO 2 species with the am-TNTA film. Upon studying the characteristics of the synthesized am-TNTA photocatalyst film, the CO 2 photoreduction experiment in the water vapor at 39 C was conducted under UV light irradiation while the CH 4 production was monitored by GC each 30 min for 4 h.Fig. 8A shows the CO 2 photocatalytic reduction activity of the fresh catalyst.The CH 4 production increased with time at a constant rate of 14.0 0.7 mol g cat -1 h -1 .This is a remarkable result for an amorphous nanostructured thinfilm catalyst produced in a fast one-step synthesis without modification.This enhanced photocatalytic activity can be attributed to the surface defects of the amorphous structure, mainly OH groups acting as electron traps and increasing the electron lifetime, as will be discussed in the sequence. After the first batch of the experiment, the am-TNTA film was removed from the reactor, dried at room temperature, and labeled as 'used-catalyst'.The CO 2 reduction experiment was repeated five times over the used catalyst.The results are depicted in Fig. 8B, which shows the CH 4 production rate in the six consequently runs using the same catalyst.The rate of CH 4 production varied in the range 13.7-14.01mol g cat -1 h -1 .The small and approximately constant error bars demonstrated the high stability of catalyst for CO 2 reduction into methane during six reaction cycles.This stability is similar to those reported for the crystalline TNTA films (Kar et al., 2019) and other TiO 2 -based catalysts like the amorphous TiO 2 NH 2 -MIL-125(Ti) film (Hu et al., 2020) and black titania powders (Yin et al., 2017), which exhibited good reproducibility in consecutive experiments of the CO conversion to CH 4 without no significant reduction of photocatalytic activity during 4-6 reaction cycles. The CH 4 production rate in CO 2 photoreduction reaction with water using different TiO 2 catalysts is shown in Table 3.It is important to stress that a direct comparison is not recommended due to the differences in the light irradiation, photocatalytic experimental conditions, and catalyst form (film and powder); however, these values work as a reference for the CH 4 yield.The average CH 4 production rate of 14.0 mol g cat h -1 obtained in this study for the am-TNTA film can be considered an impressive CH 4 production rate for a pure TiO 2 with no modification, no doping, no other materials added, and no heat treatment.As a reference, it can be seen that the pure anatase TiO 2 powder (commercial Degussa P25) as photocatalyst for CO 2 conversion to methane under UV irradiation exhibited a CH 4 production rate of 4.11 mol g cat -1 h -1 (Lo et al., 2007).Regarding TNTA films, Kar et al. (2019) tunned the type of heat treatment and electrolyte composition to teste anatase, rutile, and anatase/rutile mixtures for CO 2 reduction under solar simulated irradiation obtaining different methane yields.Using their values as a reference, the CH 4 production rate for the am-TNTA under UV irradiation (this work) is more similar to those observed for anatase TNTA under the solar simulated light (Kar et al., 2019).However, the photocatalytic activity of the crystalline TNTA was attributed to the presence of Ti 3 states and oxygen vacancies produced by the annealing treatment used to sensitize the material to visible light.Herein, the photocatalytic activity of the amorphous semiconductor is attributed to the surface defects (OH groups) acting as electron traps for reducing charge recombination.The UV-vis absorption spectrum (Fig. 3) showed that the am-TNTA can absorb partially under visible light irradiation, demonstrating that the material prepared in a one-step synthetic route also has the potential to convert CO 2 to CH 4 under solar simulated light. A possible reaction pathway for CO 2 conversion to CH 4 occurring at the am-TNTA film surface is illustrated in Fig. 9.The position of the conduction band (-0.4 V vs. NHE) was determined by Mott-Schottky analysis, and the position of the valence band (2.7 V vs. NHE) was calculated from the bandgap (3.10 eV) obtained by the Tauc plot (Fig. 3).This indicates that the counter-reaction taking place to compensate the photogenerated holes is most likely the oxidation of water to produce O 2 (Bolts and Wrighton, 1976;Al Jitan et al., 2020).spectra exhibit a similar profile, with slight changes.It is important to stress the Ti substrate naturally oxide in the air forming a thin TiO 2 layer in the nanometer range.Due to this thin TiO 2 layer covering the bare Ti, a similar profile between Ti substrate and am-TNTA was expected, except for the bonds involving N, C, and F adsorbed from the electrolyte during the synthesis.Notably, the three spectra exhibit a wide broadband from 2700 to 3700 cm -1 indicating the presence of hydroxyl groups (Erdem et al., 2001).Amino groups are generally detected in this interval; however, the hydroxyl broadband could hide them.Therefore, the identification of the N-H bond in this region is inconclusive.Nonetheless, the low-intensity bands in 1070 and 1442 cm -1 in the am-TNTA fresh are attributed to N-Ti-O stretching vibration and N-H stretching vibration, respectively (Li et al., 2014), indicating some N atoms incorporated into the TiO 2 structure.These bands are not observed in am-TNTA used, suggesting an N leaching from the film.The bending vibration of the O-H bond is observed in 1654, 1632, and cm -1 for Ti substrate, am-TNTA fresh, and am-TNTA used. The low-intensity bands observed in 2114-2200 cm -1 interval in the am-TNTA used might be associated with carbonate/carboxylate species generated by interaction with the catalyst, as proposed by Neat u et al., 2014).However, these bands are also observed with lower intensity in Ti substrate, which might indicate carbonyl groups absorbed from the air over the metallic substrate.Bands at 873 and 888 cm -1 observed in Ti substrate and am-TNTA used are assigned to Ti-O stretching bands.In the FTIR spectra of the am-TNTA fresh, this band is overlapped by another broadband in 700-900 cm -1 interval with a maximum at cm -1 that can be attributed to carbon skeleton vibrations of the ethylene glycol (Leon et al., 2017) incorporated from the electrolyte into TNTA surface that could leach the film after use. The am-TNTA stability before and after recycling was evaluated by FTIR, XPS, and PL techniques.The spectra for the fresh and used catalyst are shown in Fig. S8.As discussed in Section 3.1, the Ti 2p spectrum of the fresh catalyst corresponds to the chemical state Ti 4 .The relative intensity and position of the peaks remained unchanged in the used catalyst XPS spectrum (Fig. S8-B).The XPS spectrum of O 1s (Fig. S8 C-D) revealed the presence of hydroxyl groups or water (Hao et al., 2019).The relative intensity of these peaks is almost constant in the used catalyst.The C 1s spectra (Fig. S8 E-F) indicates peaks related to C-C, C-O, and COOH (Zaleska et al., 2008), originating from the Ethylene glycol used in the preparation of the am-TNTA film.Notably, no heat treatment was done on the synthesized catalyst.However, the relative intensity of the C 1s spectrum remains almost constant in the used catalyst compared to the fresh catalyst, which is in agreement with the photocatalytic reduction results confirming that the produced methane is not originated from this carbon source but CO 2 .The XPS wide spectrum (Fig. S8 G-H) also shows the presence of a small amount of F and N, which are originated from the NH 4 F salt employed in the synthesis of the am-TNTA film. The PL spectra of fresh and used catalysts until the fourth cycle are illustrated in Fig. 11.The emission spectra were collected with excitation at 325 nm wavelength and revealed that the am-TNTA does not present a broadband emission, but several peaks in the whole range of wavelength, indicating multiphononic processes.This behavior, observed for the fresh and used catalyst, was reported in other studies from the literature (Bavykin et al., 2005;Vijayan et al., 2012).In the PL properties of colloidal TiO 2 nanotubes produced by the alkali hydrothermal method (Bavykin et al., 2005), many sharp peaks were observed in the 300-700 nm range.The authors attributed the sharp bands to the low energy states as residual cations incorporated in the material during the synthesis.A similar feature was reported for TiO 2 nanotubes and carbon nanotubes composites (Vijayan et al., 2012).Usually, these sharp bands in PL spectra of semiconductors are attributed to transitions involving impurities states, doping, and the existence of trap states in bandgap promoted by defects.In other PL spectra of TNTA films, broadbands emission was observed and deconvoluted into many emission peaks in the whole range of emission wavelength (Siuzdak et al. 2015a(Siuzdak et al. , 2015b)).The authors suggested that the presence of several peaks in the PL spectrum of TiO 2 nanotubes could have resulted from the existence of sub-bandgap states in the complex structure of nanotubes (Siuzdak et al., 2015b). This behavior implies that several paths for the emission due to the high density of electronic states caused by defects (Mendez-Galvan et al., 2021).These peaks confirm the presence of many deep and shallow surface states, which could enhance the separation of electron/hole pairs and decrease the recombination rate of photoexcited charge carriers (Wang et al., 2018).These defects can be promoted by different oxygen defects like mono-ionized oxygen vacancies (shallow defects) and double-ionized oxygen vacancies (deep defects) formed as a consequence of doping/modification or heat treatment, or they can be caused by hydroxyl/water groups which can trap the electrons and act as shallow acceptor levels (Kharade and Chang, 2020;Mendez-Galvan et al., 2021).For the am-TNTA film, FTIR, XPS, and EIS results evidence that these defects are probably caused by the hydroxyl groups acting as a trap for the CO 2 via formation of carbonate species.On the other hand, the results showed a small absorption of the am-TNTA in the visible light region (Fig. 3) that can be attributed to N incorporated into the film during the synthesis, as suggested by other authors (Li et al., 2010), which can act as impurities in the synthesized material, creating sub-bandgap states. Regarding the intensity of the emission peak, some factors might be contributed to a low emission peak of the am-TNTA film.Since the film was grown on a titanium conductive substrate, the separation of charge carriers due to the transfer of electrons to the conductive substrate could suppress the intensity of PL emission.Another factor is the amorphous character of the am-TNTA.Crystalline semiconductors are expected to exhibit high intensity PL due to their low recombination radioactive when compared with the amorphous. Furthermore, the PL spectra of the used catalyst slightly declined when compared to the fresh catalyst.This minor decrease could result from the adsorption of either reactants or products on the catalyst.Stevanovic et al. (2012) studied the effect of several adsorbed molecules on the PL spectrum of TiO 2 .They found that adsorption of either electron donor or electron acceptor species decreases the PL intensity of the TiO 2 catalyst.The reduction in the PL intensity was related to the band bending and formation of the depletion layer.However, the reduction in the PL intensity in Fig. 11 is insignificant, which agrees with the catalyst stability for methane formation in the repeated experiments. In correspondence to the PL analysis, the C 1s spectrum of XPS (Fig. S8 E-F) does not indicate any noticeable change in the amount of carbon on the catalyst surface.Also, the presence of the irreversible adsorbed oxygenated intermediates or products on the surface of the film should change the O 1s XPS high-resolution spectrum, which has remained almost unchanged in the used catalyst compared to the fresh catalyst.Therefore, the prepared am-TNTA film is highly stable for CO 2 photocatalytic reduction. It is important to discuss some aspects about the findings correlating all data.The results show that photocatalytic activity of the am-TNTA film in the CO 2 reduction to CH 4 can be explained in terms of defects caused by the surface hydroxyl species.Traps are electronic energy levels located in the bandgap of a semiconductor and are involved in the charge-transfer process (Wang et al., 2001).It includes surface states, oxygen vacancies, adsorbed species.Shallow defects are energetically closed to CB or VB, whereas deep defects are energetically closed to the Fermi level (Mendez-Galvan et al., 2021).A nanostructured morphology like the TNTA presents a large number of electron traps at the surface and the grain boundaries, influencing the interfacial kinetics of the transfer processes.The detrapping is possible for these shallow traps, but the deep (bulk) traps can immobilize carriers irreversibly (Wehrenfennig et al., 2015), compromising the charge transfer processes.This is the main reason for the short anodizing time chosen in the synthesis in this study.A longer anodizing time would produce a longer nanotube length, where the light could penetrate deeply, reaching the bulk traps and, consequently, reducing the efficiency of the photocatalytic process. Among these defects, Ti 3 surface states, mono-ionized oxygen vacancies (shallow traps), and doubled-ionized oxygen vacancies (deep traps) were not evidenced in this study.On the other hand, the presence of surface hydroxyl groups was evidenced by FTIR and XPS analysis of am-TNTA film.Hydroxyl groups are considered dominant sites for trapping electrons acting as shallow acceptor levels (Mendez-Galvan et al., 2021).PL spectra (Fig. 11) showed many states attributed to shallow defects that can be promoted by these hydroxyl/water groups.In the case of CO 2 photoreduction, the hydroxyl groups act like traps via formation of the carbonate species (Kharade and Chang, 2020), as suggested by the analysis of the electrochemical data.Therefore, since CO 2 interacts directly with the traps, forming carbonate species, we can assume that, in the am-TNTA film, the charge is transferred directly from these shallow levels.To evaluate the effect of the deep defects of am-TNTA film on the photocatalytic activity in CO 2 reduction, further studies are necessary by fabricating the am-TNTA with different thicknesses, nanotube diameter, and nanotube walls.This study will also be important to verify if the charge carriers from different trap states are homogeneously distributed along the nanotube length and diameter.The effect of these defects on the selectivity towards specific products also should be addressed. The main consequence of these traps is the increase of the electron lifetime, favoring the photocatalytic activity of the am-TNTA and preventing them from charge recombination.The recombination of charge carriers (electron/hole pairs) is a major challenge in developing an efficient photocatalyst.The lifetime of photoexcited electrons and holes is estimated to be in the order of 10 -9 s, while the CO 2 reduction reaction requires a longer time (Fan et al., 2013).Therefore, any change which could decrease the recombination rate of electrons and holes will significantly improve the photocatalytic reduction efficiency.Moreover, metals generally have lower Fermi energies than semiconductors which implies that electrons transfer from the semiconductor to the metal.This flow of electrons will lead to the formation of the Schottky barrier at the interface of the conductor/semiconductor that functions as an effective electron trap.Consequently, the formation of the Schottky barrier will increase the lifetime of the excited electrons, which is essential for developing an efficient photocatalyst (Khan et al., 2015).However, it is important to stress that the charge transfer processes in the amorphous material are not faster as the crystalline TiO 2 .Therefore, this is a factor that also should be addressed in the development of the catalyst."}, {"llm generation": "UV", "source": "As a reference, it can be seen that the pure anatase TiO 2 powder (commercial Degussa P25) as photocatalyst for CO 2 conversion to methane under UV irradiation exhibited a CH 4 production rate of 4.11 mol g cat -1 h -1 (Lo et al., 2007).", "context": "The anodization of Titanium and other valve metals is a well-known technique used to produce nanostructured oxide films (Lee et al., 2014;Indira et al., 2015;Trivinho-Strixino et al., 2017).These nanomaterials are extensively explored in numerous applications in energy, biological and environmental fields due to their facile synthesis with environmental-friendly experimental conditions (mild temperature and low-toxicity reagents) and control of morphology, composition, and structure by the synthetic parameters (Santos et al., 2021).Additionally, the resulting oxides coatings exhibit high surface area per volume, chemical stability, and rigid adhesion between metal and oxide layer, avoiding the use of binder agents. The fabrication of the TNTA via the anodization technique consists of three main steps: preparing the metallic substrate, the anodizing, and the heat treatment.For most applications, anodizing and heat treatment require longer times.The anodizing time can vary from 20 min to 24 h (Santos et al., 2021).The production of nanotubes with a large length and high-aspect ratio requires long anodizing times.Besides, to obtain a high-ordered array, two anodization steps might be necessary.The heat treatment is usually performed at 450-600 C for 1-3 h, disregarding the warm-up and cooling steps, which require additional hours. In the Ti anodization, the TNTA films are grown on the surface of Ti substrates by the anodic oxidation of Ti metallic to TiO 2 , usually in organic media containing fluoride ions.The morphology of the nanostructured film is controlled by the anodizing conditions, i. e. the applied voltage, temperature, electrolyte composition, and anodizing time (Trivinho-Strixino et al., 2017).Applied voltage, for instance, tends to influence the nanotube inner diameter, whereas the temperature, water, and fluoride content can affect the dimensions and shape of the nanotube walls.Anodizing time usually influences the nanotube length (Vargas et al., 2019).In this study, considering that only the outermost surface layer of the amorphous catalyst is active for CO 2 photoreduction, the samples were anodizing for 30 min to produce a thinner film.This approach avoids that the light penetrating too deep inside into the am-TNTA film since traps in the bulk of the material can compromise the reduction and oxidation potential of the electrons and holes, inhibiting transport and charge transfer (Baccaro and Gutz, 2018). Therefore, TNTA films were grown over Ti substrate via potentiostatic anodization at 50 V for 30 min in Ethylene glycol media containing 0.75 wt.NH 4 F and 10 vol.Water.The same anodizing conditions (except the anodized area) were used for all the samples used in this study.The current transients were monitored to assure the experiments repeatability and, consequently, the homogeneity of the material properties in the samples with different anodized areas (see SI file for details). Fig. 1A depicts the current density vs. time curve, divided into three typical regions (Ferreira et al., 2019).Region I is characterized by the abrupt drop of the current density in the early stages of the anodization (0-15 s) until reaching a minimum value denoted by point a in the inset of Fig. 1A.This current reduction is promoted by the formation of the compact oxide film, namely barrier oxide, which increases the resistance of the system (Trivinho-Strixino et al., 2017).In region II, nucleation of the nanotubes takes place.Since the formation of open channels in the oxide offers less resistive pathways, the current density rises with the increase of the surface area of the oxide until achieving point b, where the pores achieve their maximum diameter.After this point, the oxide grows in the bottom of the nanotube, that is, into the metal/oxide interface, resulting in the enlargement of the oxide layer and the nanotube length.Simultaneously to the oxide growth reaction, fluoride ions in the electrolytic medium are promoting the dissolution of the oxide via TiF 6 -2 complex formation (Ghicov and Schmuki, 2009).In region III, the oxide formation reaction and dissolution process reach a steady-state resulting in the vertical growth of the nanotubular structure of TiO 2 .The stages of the oxide layer formation over the titanium substrate monitored by the anodization curve (Fig. 1A) are illustrated in Fig. 1B.This schematic illustration shows the steps of titanium anodic oxidation, including the barrier oxide film formation, pores nucleation, and nanotubes growth into the substrate. Fig. 1C shows the nanotubular structure of the am-TNTA surface obtained by SEM.The nanotubes inner diameter presented values in the 80-120 nm range, with an average value of 100 10 nm, wall NT thickness of 26 5 nm, and a void distance between the nanotubes of 12 9 nm.The nanotube length values ranging from 3.4 to 3.9 m were determined from the SEM side view of the sample (Fig. 1D) obtained in different positions.The average thickness of 3.7 0.3 m found is similar to other TNTA films synthesized under similar conditions reported in the literature (Atyaoui et al., 2013;Hao et al., 2019).Table 1 depicts the compositional analysis of the oxide layer obtained by EDX (see the full table in Supporting Information for more details).The semi-quantitative analysis shows Ti and O elements as majority composition, as expected for the TiO 2 layers, with 33.30 At. and 45.25 At., respectively.N, F and C species from the electrolyte composed of NH 4 F and Ethylene glycol were incorporated into the film in minor quantities.The homogenous distribution of the elements along the am-TNTA surface is shown in Fig. S3. The TNTA films produced by the anodization technique under low voltages (10-60 V) are typically amorphous (Simon et al., 2019(Simon et al., , 2021)), although some authors reported traces of the anatase phase in the film synthetized at 40 V in a glycerol-based electrolyte (Macak et al., 2008).Therefore, for a full oxide crystallization, heat treatment in temperatures above 400 C is necessary (Ghicov and Schmuki, 2009;Indira et al., 2015;Santos et al., 2021).In this study, the focus is on evaluating the photocatalytic activity and stability of the amorphous material; then, the TNTA samples were used as anodized.Fig. 2 depicts the diffractograms of the metallic titanium substrate, the am-TNTA sample, and an anodized TNTA sample produced under the exact anodizing conditions, which was annealed at 450 C under air for 2 h at a 7 C min -1 heating rate.After being maintained at 450 C for 2 h in the tube furnace, the sample was cooling down to room temperature naturally. The diffractogram of the metallic Ti exhibits the Bragg peaks of the hexagonal phase according to PDF 00-044-1294 (Sailer and McCarthy, 1993), where the main peak ( 101) is observed at 40.2 .Other characteristic peaks of this metallic phase are (100) at 35.1 , (002) at 38.4 , (102) at 53 , (103) at 70.7 .These peaks are also observed in the pattern of the annealed TNTA, which reveals a mixture of hexagonal Ti and anatase TiO 2 phase, indicating that the X-ray beam reached the substrate during the scan.The main peaks of the anatase phase are indicated in the second diffractogram according to PDF 01-086-1157 (Sanchez et al., 1996), where the most intensity peak ( 101) is observed at 25.3 .Other characteristic peaks of the anatase phase are (004) at 37.9 , (200) at 48 , (105) at 54.0 , and (211) at 55.1 .The diffractogram of the am-TNTA sample was performed using a small scattering angle to minimize the effect of the metallic substrate.Its pattern is characterized by broader low-intensity peaks and a deviation from the baseline at 2 range from 10 to 35 ; a larger deviation at low 2 when compared with the other two diffractograms.The baseline deviation, broader peaks, or absence of peaks are typical for amorphous material since the crystalline materials present a regular and straight baseline, and well-defined and sharp Bragg peaks (Cullity and Stock, 2001).The broader peak around 25 (101), 37 (004), and 48 (200) in the am-TNTA diffractogram may indicate the presence of the anatase phase in a small extension.Different from powders, the crystallographic orientation of the substrate can influence the nucleation of small crystals in films during the oxide growth.However, the quantity is too small to attribute some crystalline character to the material, as reported by other authors (Macak et al., 2008).Therefore, XRD results demonstrate that TNTA without annealing is predominantly amorphous. Fig. 3 depicts the absorption spectrum of the TNTA film, where it can be seen that the semiconductor majority absorbs in the UV spectra range (390 nm).However, a small but significant absorption is also observed in the visible range (400-700 nm).Table 1 showed that am-TNTA film has 9.92 at. of N in its composition incorporated from NH 4 F content in the electrolyte during the anodization.This N content can exert some contribution to the visible light absorption observed for the am-TNTA catalyst.The incorporated nitrogen into am-TNTA, could alter the semiconductor electronic state, creating sub-energetic states (Li et al., 2010) and enhancing its photocatalytic activity under visible light irradiation. The bandgap of 3.10 eV was determined from Tauc plot (Fig. 3 inset), which was calculated using Tauc's equation (h where is the absorption coefficient, h is Planck's constant, is the radiation frequency and is equal to the speed of light in a vacuum (c) divided by the wavelength (), A is the optical constant, E g is the optical band gap, and n was assumed as 0.5 for direct transitions (Nunez et al., 2021).This bandgap value is slightly larger than the 2.84 eV observed for the am-TNTA produced under similar anodizing conditions (Hao et al., 2019), but it is typical for TiO 2 materials (Ge et al., 2016). The XPS technique was employed to analyze the surface chemical state of the synthesized catalyst.Fig. 4A depicts the XPS wide spectrum which shows the presence of Ti, O, C and a small amount of F and N, which are originated from the NH 4 F salt employed in the synthesis of the am-TNTA film.The Ti 2p spectrum (Fig. 4B) shows two peaks positioned at 459.08 eV and 464.82 eV corresponding to Ti 2p 3/2 and Ti 2p 1/2 , respectively, attributed to the chemical state Ti 4 (Mu et al., 2012;Umer et al., 2019).The XPS spectrum of O 1s (Fig. 4C) was deconvoluted into three peaks positioned at 530.30 eV, 531.51 eV, and 533.06 eV.The peak at 530.30 eV corresponds to lattice oxygen (Ti-O bond), while the peaks at 531.51 eV and 533.06 eV correspond to hydroxyl groups or water (Hao et al., 2019).The C 1s high-resolution XPS (Fig. 4D) indicates three peaks related to C-C, C-O, and COOH (Zaleska et al., 2008), originating from the Ethylene glycol used in the preparation of the am-TNTA film. For nanostructure semiconductor electrodes, information about electronic structure can be extracted from the intrinsic semiconductor properties and the transient states of the semiconductor when it interacts with the electrolyte at a given electrode potential (Berger et al., 2012).Therefore, the electrochemical characterization of the am-TNTA was performed in phosphate buffer media by CV and EIS techniques. This approach was used to investigate the electronic properties of the film and the main processes occurring in the oxide surface. Fig. 5 depicts the cyclic voltammograms of the am-TNTA in the -0.9 V to 0.9 V (vs.NHE) potential window obtained at different scan rates in phosphate buffer solution (pH 7) saturated with N 2 and CO 2 from the starting potential of -0.1 V (vs.NHE).Under these conditions, no cathodic peaks were observed during the cathodic scan toward negative potentials.In the reverse scan, an anodic peak was observed around -0.6 V vs. NHE (at 5 mV s -1 ) in the direction of the positive potentials (Fig. 5A).This anodic peak can be attributed to the oxidation of the hydrogen previously adsorbed during water discharge in the cathodic scan or to the detrapping of the electrons that will be discussed in the sequence.This peak shifted to more positive values as the scan rates increased.The current density increased linearly with the scan rate, indicating no diffusional limitations under this condition, which implies that the system is explained by electron transfer kinetics (Bertoluzzi et al., 2013).The voltammograms in Fig. 5B follow the same tendency observed in Fig. 5A, and no significant features were observed in those profiles, except for the increase of the current density at high scan rates for the electrolyte saturated with CO 2 , which may indicate that the CO 2 affect the capacitance of the system. Therefore, for better visualization of these results, the current values were divided by the corresponded scan rate and plotted as a ratio between charge and potential, as shown in Fig. 5C-D.This shape can be interpreted as a relation between the trapping/detrapping process and the electron transfers between the trap and solution (Bertoluzzi et al., 2013).At a first view, when compared these charge/potential profiles (Fig. 5C-D) with CV profiles (Fig. 5A-B), it can be noted that the processes occurring at low scan rate (5 mV s -1 , black line) exhibited the larger variation in the charge/potential ratio, indicating that slow kinetic processes are favored. The plots from Fig. 5C-D depict four regions designated by i, ii, iii, and iv, in which processes can be described as follows: in region i, the traps are being filled as the system advances toward more negative potentials.In region ii, the main process is the electron transfer in the conduction band (CB), as shown by the Mott-Schottky plot in Fig. 6, where the band edge for the electron transfer from/to CB is identified as -0.4 V vs. NHE.From Fig. 5C-D, the fast increase of the charge/potential rate is observed just after this point (-0.4V vs. NHE).In region iii of the anodic scan, the charge transfer processes occurring are originated at the CB.Region iv is characterized by the electron transfer from the trap to the solution as the potential advances toward more positive values. In region iv (Fig. 5C-D), it notes that the electron transfer from the traps is becoming slower due to the adsorption of CO 2 ; in other words, the CO 2 adsorbed becomes a trap, which can stabilize the electron for a longer time in the electrode before it can be transferred.According to Kharade and Chang (2020), this stabilization can occur via hydroxyl groups on the surface of the amorphous TiO 2 that can act as a trap for CO 2 forming carbonate species, increasing CO 2 chemisorption.Therefore, herein the scan rate becomes an important parameter.If the process is slow, more electrons are transferred at lower scan rates.On the other hand, if the process is fast enough, no difference is observed.This factor also may explain why there is no variation of charge in the region i in CO 2 saturated electrolyte (Fig. 5D).Since the CO 2 is adsorbed, the carbonated species formed by chemisorption on the surface act as a trap for electrons, resulting in no variation of the charge in the region i (Fig. 5D). Besides the flat band potential (E fb ), identified as -0.4 V vs. NHE by extrapolation of the linear part of the Mott-Schottky plots (Fig. 6), the charge carriers density (N D ) for the am-TNTA electrode was determined from the Mott-Schottky equation (Hanzu et al., 2011), where the values of 1.2 10 -19 cm -3 and 9.3 10 -19 cm -3 were found for the measurements performed in phosphate buffer solution saturated with N 2 and CO 2 , respectively, assuming a relative permittivity of 55 for TNTA (Raza et al., 2021).These results show that the flat band potential did not change with the CO 2 purge in the electrolyte, but the charge carrier density increased.One hypothesis for the high charge carrier density is the presence of carbonate groups formed on the electrode surface by chemisorption acting like donor group and making the electrons move more freely. The Nyquist plot shows the imaginary part of the complex impedance (-Z ) as a function of the real part (Z ) of the am-TNTA electrode for different frequency values.Fig. S7 (SI file) depicts the impedance spectra for the photocatalyst at -0.2 V, -0.4 V, and -0.6 V vs. NHE.These curves represent the system under three different conditions, i.e., when the applied potential is less negative than the flat band potential (E fb ), equal to E fb , and more negative than E fb .The insets exhibit the highfrequency region, where a semicircle arc is observed in the measurement carried out in electrolyte purge with N 2 at -0.2 V vs. NHE, and its shape is related to the electrolyte resistance (Mei et al., 2018;Freitas et al., 2014).Fig. 7 shows that this semicircle was not observed clearly at more negative potentials or when CO 2 was introduced into the solution. A slight deviation at the low-frequency values was observed with the increase of the solution's resistance in the CO 2 saturated electrolyte.Regarding the different behavior as a function of the applied bias in each case, the change in the semicircle format shows the reduction of the internal resistance (electrode and electrolyte) of the system at more negative potentials. Regarding the N 2 saturation, note in Fig. 7 that the values that close the pseudo-semicircle for each applied potential has the same frequency (398 Hz).This means there is an electron transfer process taking place with that time constant, which charge transfer resistance decreases when the applied potential increase.This happens until it reaches the value of the conduction band, and the transfer from the band takes place.Besides, the frequency of the process (398 Hz 3.98 10 2 s -1 ) is similar to the one reported by Bertoluzzi et al. (5 10 2 s -1 ) (Bertoluzzi and Bisquert, 2012).For the CO 2 saturated electrolyte, the pseudo-semicircle closes at a higher frequency (1000 Hz), which means that it is a faster process overlapping the traps filling, and the electron transfer has a higher resistance. Table 2 shows the capacitance and resistance values obtained fitting the data with a simulated equivalent circuit illustrated in Fig. S7.This circuit was composed of a, b, c circuit parts with resistance and capacitance elements, where R t/d is the trapping/detrapping resistance, C dl is the double-layer capacitance, R t is the resistance of the charge transfer from the trap, C t is the capacitance of the trap, C ct is the capacitance of the charge transfer process from the band, and R ct is the charge transfer resistance from the band. The results from Table 2 showed that the resistance of the trapping/ detrapping (R t/d ) and the capacitance of the double-layer (C dl ) are approximately constant in N 2 saturated electrolyte and presented no significant variation in the CO 2 case, indicating significant changes in the trapping/detrapping mechanism with the applied potential.However, compared with N 2 saturated electrolyte, the resistance (R t/d ) values are higher in CO 2 while C dl values are small.The charge transfer resistance from the traps (R t ) decreases toward more negative potentials as the traps are being filled from the solution with N 2 , but it remained constant in CO 2 solution.The capacitance of the traps (C t ) exhibits a maximum value is at -0.2 V (vs.NHE) in both cases.These values are related to the semicircles from the Nyquist plots.As the overpotential increases (potential become more negative), the resistance of the charge transfer from the traps (R ct ) reduces while the corresponding capacitance (C ct ) increases.This indicates that the accumulation of charge is diminishing toward more negative potentials. These results show that the major effect is the CO 2 on the trap filling resistance.The traps are easily or faster filled when the CO 2 is adsorbed, Fig. 7. Detail of the high-frequency regions of the Nyquist diagrams for am-TNTA film obtained in phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.0) saturated with N 2 (right) and CO 2 (left) at -0.2 V, -0.4 V, and -0.6 V vs. NHE. Capacitance and resistance elements obtained from the simulated equivalent circuit illustrated in Fig. S7 according to the applied bias.which supports the hypothesis that the CO 2 interacts directly with the traps, promoting the charge transfer from these intermediate energy levels. It is important to stress that the electrochemical impedance behavior of TNTA films described in the literature diverges one from another according to the film properties and the experimental conditions used during the measurements.So, there is no expected standardized profile for TNTA in general.Also, it is not usual to perform the analysis in CO 2 saturated electrolyte.This implies that a further systematic study should be performed to a better comprehension of these findings by changing the type of gas purged into the electrolyte, testing other pH solutions, and performing under UV-light light irradiation.Regarding this preliminary set of experiments, these EIS results can be summarized as follows: the processes at the electrode surface are affected by (i) the applied potential (more or less negative than the flat band potential of the material), and by (ii) the type of the adsorbent species since the presence and absence of CO 2 molecules were analyzed.This latter factor is the first evidence about the interaction of CO 2 species with the am-TNTA film. Upon studying the characteristics of the synthesized am-TNTA photocatalyst film, the CO 2 photoreduction experiment in the water vapor at 39 C was conducted under UV light irradiation while the CH 4 production was monitored by GC each 30 min for 4 h.Fig. 8A shows the CO 2 photocatalytic reduction activity of the fresh catalyst.The CH 4 production increased with time at a constant rate of 14.0 0.7 mol g cat -1 h -1 .This is a remarkable result for an amorphous nanostructured thinfilm catalyst produced in a fast one-step synthesis without modification.This enhanced photocatalytic activity can be attributed to the surface defects of the amorphous structure, mainly OH groups acting as electron traps and increasing the electron lifetime, as will be discussed in the sequence. After the first batch of the experiment, the am-TNTA film was removed from the reactor, dried at room temperature, and labeled as 'used-catalyst'.The CO 2 reduction experiment was repeated five times over the used catalyst.The results are depicted in Fig. 8B, which shows the CH 4 production rate in the six consequently runs using the same catalyst.The rate of CH 4 production varied in the range 13.7-14.01mol g cat -1 h -1 .The small and approximately constant error bars demonstrated the high stability of catalyst for CO 2 reduction into methane during six reaction cycles.This stability is similar to those reported for the crystalline TNTA films (Kar et al., 2019) and other TiO 2 -based catalysts like the amorphous TiO 2 NH 2 -MIL-125(Ti) film (Hu et al., 2020) and black titania powders (Yin et al., 2017), which exhibited good reproducibility in consecutive experiments of the CO conversion to CH 4 without no significant reduction of photocatalytic activity during 4-6 reaction cycles. The CH 4 production rate in CO 2 photoreduction reaction with water using different TiO 2 catalysts is shown in Table 3.It is important to stress that a direct comparison is not recommended due to the differences in the light irradiation, photocatalytic experimental conditions, and catalyst form (film and powder); however, these values work as a reference for the CH 4 yield.The average CH 4 production rate of 14.0 mol g cat h -1 obtained in this study for the am-TNTA film can be considered an impressive CH 4 production rate for a pure TiO 2 with no modification, no doping, no other materials added, and no heat treatment.As a reference, it can be seen that the pure anatase TiO 2 powder (commercial Degussa P25) as photocatalyst for CO 2 conversion to methane under UV irradiation exhibited a CH 4 production rate of 4.11 mol g cat -1 h -1 (Lo et al., 2007).Regarding TNTA films, Kar et al. (2019) tunned the type of heat treatment and electrolyte composition to teste anatase, rutile, and anatase/rutile mixtures for CO 2 reduction under solar simulated irradiation obtaining different methane yields.Using their values as a reference, the CH 4 production rate for the am-TNTA under UV irradiation (this work) is more similar to those observed for anatase TNTA under the solar simulated light (Kar et al., 2019).However, the photocatalytic activity of the crystalline TNTA was attributed to the presence of Ti 3 states and oxygen vacancies produced by the annealing treatment used to sensitize the material to visible light.Herein, the photocatalytic activity of the amorphous semiconductor is attributed to the surface defects (OH groups) acting as electron traps for reducing charge recombination.The UV-vis absorption spectrum (Fig. 3) showed that the am-TNTA can absorb partially under visible light irradiation, demonstrating that the material prepared in a one-step synthetic route also has the potential to convert CO 2 to CH 4 under solar simulated light. A possible reaction pathway for CO 2 conversion to CH 4 occurring at the am-TNTA film surface is illustrated in Fig. 9.The position of the conduction band (-0.4 V vs. NHE) was determined by Mott-Schottky analysis, and the position of the valence band (2.7 V vs. NHE) was calculated from the bandgap (3.10 eV) obtained by the Tauc plot (Fig. 3).This indicates that the counter-reaction taking place to compensate the photogenerated holes is most likely the oxidation of water to produce O 2 (Bolts and Wrighton, 1976;Al Jitan et al., 2020).spectra exhibit a similar profile, with slight changes.It is important to stress the Ti substrate naturally oxide in the air forming a thin TiO 2 layer in the nanometer range.Due to this thin TiO 2 layer covering the bare Ti, a similar profile between Ti substrate and am-TNTA was expected, except for the bonds involving N, C, and F adsorbed from the electrolyte during the synthesis.Notably, the three spectra exhibit a wide broadband from 2700 to 3700 cm -1 indicating the presence of hydroxyl groups (Erdem et al., 2001).Amino groups are generally detected in this interval; however, the hydroxyl broadband could hide them.Therefore, the identification of the N-H bond in this region is inconclusive.Nonetheless, the low-intensity bands in 1070 and 1442 cm -1 in the am-TNTA fresh are attributed to N-Ti-O stretching vibration and N-H stretching vibration, respectively (Li et al., 2014), indicating some N atoms incorporated into the TiO 2 structure.These bands are not observed in am-TNTA used, suggesting an N leaching from the film.The bending vibration of the O-H bond is observed in 1654, 1632, and cm -1 for Ti substrate, am-TNTA fresh, and am-TNTA used. The low-intensity bands observed in 2114-2200 cm -1 interval in the am-TNTA used might be associated with carbonate/carboxylate species generated by interaction with the catalyst, as proposed by Neat u et al., 2014).However, these bands are also observed with lower intensity in Ti substrate, which might indicate carbonyl groups absorbed from the air over the metallic substrate.Bands at 873 and 888 cm -1 observed in Ti substrate and am-TNTA used are assigned to Ti-O stretching bands.In the FTIR spectra of the am-TNTA fresh, this band is overlapped by another broadband in 700-900 cm -1 interval with a maximum at cm -1 that can be attributed to carbon skeleton vibrations of the ethylene glycol (Leon et al., 2017) incorporated from the electrolyte into TNTA surface that could leach the film after use. The am-TNTA stability before and after recycling was evaluated by FTIR, XPS, and PL techniques.The spectra for the fresh and used catalyst are shown in Fig. S8.As discussed in Section 3.1, the Ti 2p spectrum of the fresh catalyst corresponds to the chemical state Ti 4 .The relative intensity and position of the peaks remained unchanged in the used catalyst XPS spectrum (Fig. S8-B).The XPS spectrum of O 1s (Fig. S8 C-D) revealed the presence of hydroxyl groups or water (Hao et al., 2019).The relative intensity of these peaks is almost constant in the used catalyst.The C 1s spectra (Fig. S8 E-F) indicates peaks related to C-C, C-O, and COOH (Zaleska et al., 2008), originating from the Ethylene glycol used in the preparation of the am-TNTA film.Notably, no heat treatment was done on the synthesized catalyst.However, the relative intensity of the C 1s spectrum remains almost constant in the used catalyst compared to the fresh catalyst, which is in agreement with the photocatalytic reduction results confirming that the produced methane is not originated from this carbon source but CO 2 .The XPS wide spectrum (Fig. S8 G-H) also shows the presence of a small amount of F and N, which are originated from the NH 4 F salt employed in the synthesis of the am-TNTA film. The PL spectra of fresh and used catalysts until the fourth cycle are illustrated in Fig. 11.The emission spectra were collected with excitation at 325 nm wavelength and revealed that the am-TNTA does not present a broadband emission, but several peaks in the whole range of wavelength, indicating multiphononic processes.This behavior, observed for the fresh and used catalyst, was reported in other studies from the literature (Bavykin et al., 2005;Vijayan et al., 2012).In the PL properties of colloidal TiO 2 nanotubes produced by the alkali hydrothermal method (Bavykin et al., 2005), many sharp peaks were observed in the 300-700 nm range.The authors attributed the sharp bands to the low energy states as residual cations incorporated in the material during the synthesis.A similar feature was reported for TiO 2 nanotubes and carbon nanotubes composites (Vijayan et al., 2012).Usually, these sharp bands in PL spectra of semiconductors are attributed to transitions involving impurities states, doping, and the existence of trap states in bandgap promoted by defects.In other PL spectra of TNTA films, broadbands emission was observed and deconvoluted into many emission peaks in the whole range of emission wavelength (Siuzdak et al. 2015a(Siuzdak et al. , 2015b)).The authors suggested that the presence of several peaks in the PL spectrum of TiO 2 nanotubes could have resulted from the existence of sub-bandgap states in the complex structure of nanotubes (Siuzdak et al., 2015b). This behavior implies that several paths for the emission due to the high density of electronic states caused by defects (Mendez-Galvan et al., 2021).These peaks confirm the presence of many deep and shallow surface states, which could enhance the separation of electron/hole pairs and decrease the recombination rate of photoexcited charge carriers (Wang et al., 2018).These defects can be promoted by different oxygen defects like mono-ionized oxygen vacancies (shallow defects) and double-ionized oxygen vacancies (deep defects) formed as a consequence of doping/modification or heat treatment, or they can be caused by hydroxyl/water groups which can trap the electrons and act as shallow acceptor levels (Kharade and Chang, 2020;Mendez-Galvan et al., 2021).For the am-TNTA film, FTIR, XPS, and EIS results evidence that these defects are probably caused by the hydroxyl groups acting as a trap for the CO 2 via formation of carbonate species.On the other hand, the results showed a small absorption of the am-TNTA in the visible light region (Fig. 3) that can be attributed to N incorporated into the film during the synthesis, as suggested by other authors (Li et al., 2010), which can act as impurities in the synthesized material, creating sub-bandgap states. Regarding the intensity of the emission peak, some factors might be contributed to a low emission peak of the am-TNTA film.Since the film was grown on a titanium conductive substrate, the separation of charge carriers due to the transfer of electrons to the conductive substrate could suppress the intensity of PL emission.Another factor is the amorphous character of the am-TNTA.Crystalline semiconductors are expected to exhibit high intensity PL due to their low recombination radioactive when compared with the amorphous. Furthermore, the PL spectra of the used catalyst slightly declined when compared to the fresh catalyst.This minor decrease could result from the adsorption of either reactants or products on the catalyst.Stevanovic et al. (2012) studied the effect of several adsorbed molecules on the PL spectrum of TiO 2 .They found that adsorption of either electron donor or electron acceptor species decreases the PL intensity of the TiO 2 catalyst.The reduction in the PL intensity was related to the band bending and formation of the depletion layer.However, the reduction in the PL intensity in Fig. 11 is insignificant, which agrees with the catalyst stability for methane formation in the repeated experiments. In correspondence to the PL analysis, the C 1s spectrum of XPS (Fig. S8 E-F) does not indicate any noticeable change in the amount of carbon on the catalyst surface.Also, the presence of the irreversible adsorbed oxygenated intermediates or products on the surface of the film should change the O 1s XPS high-resolution spectrum, which has remained almost unchanged in the used catalyst compared to the fresh catalyst.Therefore, the prepared am-TNTA film is highly stable for CO 2 photocatalytic reduction. It is important to discuss some aspects about the findings correlating all data.The results show that photocatalytic activity of the am-TNTA film in the CO 2 reduction to CH 4 can be explained in terms of defects caused by the surface hydroxyl species.Traps are electronic energy levels located in the bandgap of a semiconductor and are involved in the charge-transfer process (Wang et al., 2001).It includes surface states, oxygen vacancies, adsorbed species.Shallow defects are energetically closed to CB or VB, whereas deep defects are energetically closed to the Fermi level (Mendez-Galvan et al., 2021).A nanostructured morphology like the TNTA presents a large number of electron traps at the surface and the grain boundaries, influencing the interfacial kinetics of the transfer processes.The detrapping is possible for these shallow traps, but the deep (bulk) traps can immobilize carriers irreversibly (Wehrenfennig et al., 2015), compromising the charge transfer processes.This is the main reason for the short anodizing time chosen in the synthesis in this study.A longer anodizing time would produce a longer nanotube length, where the light could penetrate deeply, reaching the bulk traps and, consequently, reducing the efficiency of the photocatalytic process. Among these defects, Ti 3 surface states, mono-ionized oxygen vacancies (shallow traps), and doubled-ionized oxygen vacancies (deep traps) were not evidenced in this study.On the other hand, the presence of surface hydroxyl groups was evidenced by FTIR and XPS analysis of am-TNTA film.Hydroxyl groups are considered dominant sites for trapping electrons acting as shallow acceptor levels (Mendez-Galvan et al., 2021).PL spectra (Fig. 11) showed many states attributed to shallow defects that can be promoted by these hydroxyl/water groups.In the case of CO 2 photoreduction, the hydroxyl groups act like traps via formation of the carbonate species (Kharade and Chang, 2020), as suggested by the analysis of the electrochemical data.Therefore, since CO 2 interacts directly with the traps, forming carbonate species, we can assume that, in the am-TNTA film, the charge is transferred directly from these shallow levels.To evaluate the effect of the deep defects of am-TNTA film on the photocatalytic activity in CO 2 reduction, further studies are necessary by fabricating the am-TNTA with different thicknesses, nanotube diameter, and nanotube walls.This study will also be important to verify if the charge carriers from different trap states are homogeneously distributed along the nanotube length and diameter.The effect of these defects on the selectivity towards specific products also should be addressed. The main consequence of these traps is the increase of the electron lifetime, favoring the photocatalytic activity of the am-TNTA and preventing them from charge recombination.The recombination of charge carriers (electron/hole pairs) is a major challenge in developing an efficient photocatalyst.The lifetime of photoexcited electrons and holes is estimated to be in the order of 10 -9 s, while the CO 2 reduction reaction requires a longer time (Fan et al., 2013).Therefore, any change which could decrease the recombination rate of electrons and holes will significantly improve the photocatalytic reduction efficiency.Moreover, metals generally have lower Fermi energies than semiconductors which implies that electrons transfer from the semiconductor to the metal.This flow of electrons will lead to the formation of the Schottky barrier at the interface of the conductor/semiconductor that functions as an effective electron trap.Consequently, the formation of the Schottky barrier will increase the lifetime of the excited electrons, which is essential for developing an efficient photocatalyst (Khan et al., 2015).However, it is important to stress that the charge transfer processes in the amorphous material are not faster as the crystalline TiO 2 .Therefore, this is a factor that also should be addressed in the development of the catalyst."}, {"llm generation": "UV light", "source": "The CO 2 reduction reaction with water to methane was carried out under UV light irradiation and presented a CH 4 production rate of 14.0 0.7 mol g cat -1 h -1 , a remarkable photocatalytic activity for an amorphous titania-based material without any modification procedure.", "context": "This study evaluated the efficiency and stability of am-TNTA film in CO 2 photoreduction reaction with water to produce methane.The catalyst was fabricated in a one-step procedure without annealing, and it was used as anodized.A shorter anodizing time was chosen to produce a thinner and defective nanotubular titania film (3.7 m thick).Under these conditions, the time of preparation was reduced drastically.The CO 2 reduction reaction with water to methane was carried out under UV light irradiation and presented a CH 4 production rate of 14.0 0.7 mol g cat -1 h -1 , a remarkable photocatalytic activity for an amorphous titania-based material without any modification procedure.After the reaction, the catalyst was dried and reused to evaluate the stability of the nanostructure material.The XPS and PL spectra of the anodized material obtained before and after the experiments demonstrated high stability. The notable result can be explained by the nature of its nanostructure morphology combined with a large number of traps on its surface.The results indicate that those traps are caused by surface hydroxyl groups forming carbonate species which could increase the electron lifetime favoring the CO 2 reduction reaction.This first set of experiments shows that this anodized material is a potential candidate for a sustainable CO 2 reduction process.However, additional studies are required to comprehend the mechanism of the CO 2 conversion to methane under this support and the relation among its morphology, surface defects, and efficiency.Modifications in the material that does not involve annealing step should also be addressed.

The fabrication of the TNTA via the anodization technique consists of three main steps: preparing the metallic substrate, the anodizing, and the heat treatment.For most applications, anodizing and heat treatment require longer times.The anodizing time can vary from 20 min to 24 h (Santos et al., 2021).The production of nanotubes with a large length and high-aspect ratio requires long anodizing times.Besides, to obtain a high-ordered array, two anodization steps might be necessary.The heat treatment is usually performed at 450-600 C for 1-3 h, disregarding the warm-up and cooling steps, which require additional hours. In the Ti anodization, the TNTA films are grown on the surface of Ti substrates by the anodic oxidation of Ti metallic to TiO 2 , usually in organic media containing fluoride ions.The morphology of the nanostructured film is controlled by the anodizing conditions, i. e. the applied voltage, temperature, electrolyte composition, and anodizing time (Trivinho-Strixino et al., 2017).Applied voltage, for instance, tends to influence the nanotube inner diameter, whereas the temperature, water, and fluoride content can affect the dimensions and shape of the nanotube walls.Anodizing time usually influences the nanotube length (Vargas et al., 2019).In this study, considering that only the outermost surface layer of the amorphous catalyst is active for CO 2 photoreduction, the samples were anodizing for 30 min to produce a thinner film.This approach avoids that the light penetrating too deep inside into the am-TNTA film since traps in the bulk of the material can compromise the reduction and oxidation potential of the electrons and holes, inhibiting transport and charge transfer (Baccaro and Gutz, 2018). Therefore, TNTA films were grown over Ti substrate via potentiostatic anodization at 50 V for 30 min in Ethylene glycol media containing 0.75 wt.NH 4 F and 10 vol.Water.The same anodizing conditions (except the anodized area) were used for all the samples used in this study.The current transients were monitored to assure the experiments repeatability and, consequently, the homogeneity of the material properties in the samples with different anodized areas (see SI file for details). Fig. 1A depicts the current density vs. time curve, divided into three typical regions (Ferreira et al., 2019).Region I is characterized by the abrupt drop of the current density in the early stages of the anodization (0-15 s) until reaching a minimum value denoted by point a in the inset of Fig. 1A.This current reduction is promoted by the formation of the compact oxide film, namely barrier oxide, which increases the resistance of the system (Trivinho-Strixino et al., 2017).In region II, nucleation of the nanotubes takes place.Since the formation of open channels in the oxide offers less resistive pathways, the current density rises with the increase of the surface area of the oxide until achieving point b, where the pores achieve their maximum diameter.After this point, the oxide grows in the bottom of the nanotube, that is, into the metal/oxide interface, resulting in the enlargement of the oxide layer and the nanotube length.Simultaneously to the oxide growth reaction, fluoride ions in the electrolytic medium are promoting the dissolution of the oxide via TiF 6 -2 complex formation (Ghicov and Schmuki, 2009).In region III, the oxide formation reaction and dissolution process reach a steady-state resulting in the vertical growth of the nanotubular structure of TiO 2 .The stages of the oxide layer formation over the titanium substrate monitored by the anodization curve (Fig. 1A) are illustrated in Fig. 1B.This schematic illustration shows the steps of titanium anodic oxidation, including the barrier oxide film formation, pores nucleation, and nanotubes growth into the substrate. Fig. 1C shows the nanotubular structure of the am-TNTA surface obtained by SEM.The nanotubes inner diameter presented values in the 80-120 nm range, with an average value of 100 10 nm, wall NT thickness of 26 5 nm, and a void distance between the nanotubes of 12 9 nm.The nanotube length values ranging from 3.4 to 3.9 m were determined from the SEM side view of the sample (Fig. 1D) obtained in different positions.The average thickness of 3.7 0.3 m found is similar to other TNTA films synthesized under similar conditions reported in the literature (Atyaoui et al., 2013;Hao et al., 2019).Table 1 depicts the compositional analysis of the oxide layer obtained by EDX (see the full table in Supporting Information for more details).The semi-quantitative analysis shows Ti and O elements as majority composition, as expected for the TiO 2 layers, with 33.30 At. and 45.25 At., respectively.N, F and C species from the electrolyte composed of NH 4 F and Ethylene glycol were incorporated into the film in minor quantities.The homogenous distribution of the elements along the am-TNTA surface is shown in Fig. S3. The TNTA films produced by the anodization technique under low voltages (10-60 V) are typically amorphous (Simon et al., 2019(Simon et al., , 2021)), although some authors reported traces of the anatase phase in the film synthetized at 40 V in a glycerol-based electrolyte (Macak et al., 2008).Therefore, for a full oxide crystallization, heat treatment in temperatures above 400 C is necessary (Ghicov and Schmuki, 2009;Indira et al., 2015;Santos et al., 2021).In this study, the focus is on evaluating the photocatalytic activity and stability of the amorphous material; then, the TNTA samples were used as anodized.Fig. 2 depicts the diffractograms of the metallic titanium substrate, the am-TNTA sample, and an anodized TNTA sample produced under the exact anodizing conditions, which was annealed at 450 C under air for 2 h at a 7 C min -1 heating rate.After being maintained at 450 C for 2 h in the tube furnace, the sample was cooling down to room temperature naturally. The diffractogram of the metallic Ti exhibits the Bragg peaks of the hexagonal phase according to PDF 00-044-1294 (Sailer and McCarthy, 1993), where the main peak ( 101) is observed at 40.2 .Other characteristic peaks of this metallic phase are (100) at 35.1 , (002) at 38.4 , (102) at 53 , (103) at 70.7 .These peaks are also observed in the pattern of the annealed TNTA, which reveals a mixture of hexagonal Ti and anatase TiO 2 phase, indicating that the X-ray beam reached the substrate during the scan.The main peaks of the anatase phase are indicated in the second diffractogram according to PDF 01-086-1157 (Sanchez et al., 1996), where the most intensity peak ( 101) is observed at 25.3 .Other characteristic peaks of the anatase phase are (004) at 37.9 , (200) at 48 , (105) at 54.0 , and (211) at 55.1 .The diffractogram of the am-TNTA sample was performed using a small scattering angle to minimize the effect of the metallic substrate.Its pattern is characterized by broader low-intensity peaks and a deviation from the baseline at 2 range from 10 to 35 ; a larger deviation at low 2 when compared with the other two diffractograms.The baseline deviation, broader peaks, or absence of peaks are typical for amorphous material since the crystalline materials present a regular and straight baseline, and well-defined and sharp Bragg peaks (Cullity and Stock, 2001).The broader peak around 25 (101), 37 (004), and 48 (200) in the am-TNTA diffractogram may indicate the presence of the anatase phase in a small extension.Different from powders, the crystallographic orientation of the substrate can influence the nucleation of small crystals in films during the oxide growth.However, the quantity is too small to attribute some crystalline character to the material, as reported by other authors (Macak et al., 2008).Therefore, XRD results demonstrate that TNTA without annealing is predominantly amorphous. Fig. 3 depicts the absorption spectrum of the TNTA film, where it can be seen that the semiconductor majority absorbs in the UV spectra range (390 nm).However, a small but significant absorption is also observed in the visible range (400-700 nm).Table 1 showed that am-TNTA film has 9.92 at. of N in its composition incorporated from NH 4 F content in the electrolyte during the anodization.This N content can exert some contribution to the visible light absorption observed for the am-TNTA catalyst.The incorporated nitrogen into am-TNTA, could alter the semiconductor electronic state, creating sub-energetic states (Li et al., 2010) and enhancing its photocatalytic activity under visible light irradiation. The bandgap of 3.10 eV was determined from Tauc plot (Fig. 3 inset), which was calculated using Tauc's equation (h where is the absorption coefficient, h is Planck's constant, is the radiation frequency and is equal to the speed of light in a vacuum (c) divided by the wavelength (), A is the optical constant, E g is the optical band gap, and n was assumed as 0.5 for direct transitions (Nunez et al., 2021).This bandgap value is slightly larger than the 2.84 eV observed for the am-TNTA produced under similar anodizing conditions (Hao et al., 2019), but it is typical for TiO 2 materials (Ge et al., 2016). The XPS technique was employed to analyze the surface chemical state of the synthesized catalyst.Fig. 4A depicts the XPS wide spectrum which shows the presence of Ti, O, C and a small amount of F and N, which are originated from the NH 4 F salt employed in the synthesis of the am-TNTA film.The Ti 2p spectrum (Fig. 4B) shows two peaks positioned at 459.08 eV and 464.82 eV corresponding to Ti 2p 3/2 and Ti 2p 1/2 , respectively, attributed to the chemical state Ti 4 (Mu et al., 2012;Umer et al., 2019).The XPS spectrum of O 1s (Fig. 4C) was deconvoluted into three peaks positioned at 530.30 eV, 531.51 eV, and 533.06 eV.The peak at 530.30 eV corresponds to lattice oxygen (Ti-O bond), while the peaks at 531.51 eV and 533.06 eV correspond to hydroxyl groups or water (Hao et al., 2019).The C 1s high-resolution XPS (Fig. 4D) indicates three peaks related to C-C, C-O, and COOH (Zaleska et al., 2008), originating from the Ethylene glycol used in the preparation of the am-TNTA film. For nanostructure semiconductor electrodes, information about electronic structure can be extracted from the intrinsic semiconductor properties and the transient states of the semiconductor when it interacts with the electrolyte at a given electrode potential (Berger et al., 2012).Therefore, the electrochemical characterization of the am-TNTA was performed in phosphate buffer media by CV and EIS techniques. This approach was used to investigate the electronic properties of the film and the main processes occurring in the oxide surface. Fig. 5 depicts the cyclic voltammograms of the am-TNTA in the -0.9 V to 0.9 V (vs.NHE) potential window obtained at different scan rates in phosphate buffer solution (pH 7) saturated with N 2 and CO 2 from the starting potential of -0.1 V (vs.NHE).Under these conditions, no cathodic peaks were observed during the cathodic scan toward negative potentials.In the reverse scan, an anodic peak was observed around -0.6 V vs. NHE (at 5 mV s -1 ) in the direction of the positive potentials (Fig. 5A).This anodic peak can be attributed to the oxidation of the hydrogen previously adsorbed during water discharge in the cathodic scan or to the detrapping of the electrons that will be discussed in the sequence.This peak shifted to more positive values as the scan rates increased.The current density increased linearly with the scan rate, indicating no diffusional limitations under this condition, which implies that the system is explained by electron transfer kinetics (Bertoluzzi et al., 2013).The voltammograms in Fig. 5B follow the same tendency observed in Fig. 5A, and no significant features were observed in those profiles, except for the increase of the current density at high scan rates for the electrolyte saturated with CO 2 , which may indicate that the CO 2 affect the capacitance of the system. Therefore, for better visualization of these results, the current values were divided by the corresponded scan rate and plotted as a ratio between charge and potential, as shown in Fig. 5C-D.This shape can be interpreted as a relation between the trapping/detrapping process and the electron transfers between the trap and solution (Bertoluzzi et al., 2013).At a first view, when compared these charge/potential profiles (Fig. 5C-D) with CV profiles (Fig. 5A-B), it can be noted that the processes occurring at low scan rate (5 mV s -1 , black line) exhibited the larger variation in the charge/potential ratio, indicating that slow kinetic processes are favored. The plots from Fig. 5C-D depict four regions designated by i, ii, iii, and iv, in which processes can be described as follows: in region i, the traps are being filled as the system advances toward more negative potentials.In region ii, the main process is the electron transfer in the conduction band (CB), as shown by the Mott-Schottky plot in Fig. 6, where the band edge for the electron transfer from/to CB is identified as -0.4 V vs. NHE.From Fig. 5C-D, the fast increase of the charge/potential rate is observed just after this point (-0.4V vs. NHE).In region iii of the anodic scan, the charge transfer processes occurring are originated at the CB.Region iv is characterized by the electron transfer from the trap to the solution as the potential advances toward more positive values. In region iv (Fig. 5C-D), it notes that the electron transfer from the traps is becoming slower due to the adsorption of CO 2 ; in other words, the CO 2 adsorbed becomes a trap, which can stabilize the electron for a longer time in the electrode before it can be transferred.According to Kharade and Chang (2020), this stabilization can occur via hydroxyl groups on the surface of the amorphous TiO 2 that can act as a trap for CO 2 forming carbonate species, increasing CO 2 chemisorption.Therefore, herein the scan rate becomes an important parameter.If the process is slow, more electrons are transferred at lower scan rates.On the other hand, if the process is fast enough, no difference is observed.This factor also may explain why there is no variation of charge in the region i in CO 2 saturated electrolyte (Fig. 5D).Since the CO 2 is adsorbed, the carbonated species formed by chemisorption on the surface act as a trap for electrons, resulting in no variation of the charge in the region i (Fig. 5D). Besides the flat band potential (E fb ), identified as -0.4 V vs. NHE by extrapolation of the linear part of the Mott-Schottky plots (Fig. 6), the charge carriers density (N D ) for the am-TNTA electrode was determined from the Mott-Schottky equation (Hanzu et al., 2011), where the values of 1.2 10 -19 cm -3 and 9.3 10 -19 cm -3 were found for the measurements performed in phosphate buffer solution saturated with N 2 and CO 2 , respectively, assuming a relative permittivity of 55 for TNTA (Raza et al., 2021).These results show that the flat band potential did not change with the CO 2 purge in the electrolyte, but the charge carrier density increased.One hypothesis for the high charge carrier density is the presence of carbonate groups formed on the electrode surface by chemisorption acting like donor group and making the electrons move more freely. The Nyquist plot shows the imaginary part of the complex impedance (-Z ) as a function of the real part (Z ) of the am-TNTA electrode for different frequency values.Fig. S7 (SI file) depicts the impedance spectra for the photocatalyst at -0.2 V, -0.4 V, and -0.6 V vs. NHE.These curves represent the system under three different conditions, i.e., when the applied potential is less negative than the flat band potential (E fb ), equal to E fb , and more negative than E fb .The insets exhibit the highfrequency region, where a semicircle arc is observed in the measurement carried out in electrolyte purge with N 2 at -0.2 V vs. NHE, and its shape is related to the electrolyte resistance (Mei et al., 2018;Freitas et al., 2014).Fig. 7 shows that this semicircle was not observed clearly at more negative potentials or when CO 2 was introduced into the solution. A slight deviation at the low-frequency values was observed with the increase of the solution's resistance in the CO 2 saturated electrolyte.Regarding the different behavior as a function of the applied bias in each case, the change in the semicircle format shows the reduction of the internal resistance (electrode and electrolyte) of the system at more negative potentials. Regarding the N 2 saturation, note in Fig. 7 that the values that close the pseudo-semicircle for each applied potential has the same frequency (398 Hz).This means there is an electron transfer process taking place with that time constant, which charge transfer resistance decreases when the applied potential increase.This happens until it reaches the value of the conduction band, and the transfer from the band takes place.Besides, the frequency of the process (398 Hz 3.98 10 2 s -1 ) is similar to the one reported by Bertoluzzi et al. (5 10 2 s -1 ) (Bertoluzzi and Bisquert, 2012).For the CO 2 saturated electrolyte, the pseudo-semicircle closes at a higher frequency (1000 Hz), which means that it is a faster process overlapping the traps filling, and the electron transfer has a higher resistance. Table 2 shows the capacitance and resistance values obtained fitting the data with a simulated equivalent circuit illustrated in Fig. S7.This circuit was composed of a, b, c circuit parts with resistance and capacitance elements, where R t/d is the trapping/detrapping resistance, C dl is the double-layer capacitance, R t is the resistance of the charge transfer from the trap, C t is the capacitance of the trap, C ct is the capacitance of the charge transfer process from the band, and R ct is the charge transfer resistance from the band. The results from Table 2 showed that the resistance of the trapping/ detrapping (R t/d ) and the capacitance of the double-layer (C dl ) are approximately constant in N 2 saturated electrolyte and presented no significant variation in the CO 2 case, indicating significant changes in the trapping/detrapping mechanism with the applied potential.However, compared with N 2 saturated electrolyte, the resistance (R t/d ) values are higher in CO 2 while C dl values are small.The charge transfer resistance from the traps (R t ) decreases toward more negative potentials as the traps are being filled from the solution with N 2 , but it remained constant in CO 2 solution.The capacitance of the traps (C t ) exhibits a maximum value is at -0.2 V (vs.NHE) in both cases.These values are related to the semicircles from the Nyquist plots.As the overpotential increases (potential become more negative), the resistance of the charge transfer from the traps (R ct ) reduces while the corresponding capacitance (C ct ) increases.This indicates that the accumulation of charge is diminishing toward more negative potentials. These results show that the major effect is the CO 2 on the trap filling resistance.The traps are easily or faster filled when the CO 2 is adsorbed, Fig. 7. Detail of the high-frequency regions of the Nyquist diagrams for am-TNTA film obtained in phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.0) saturated with N 2 (right) and CO 2 (left) at -0.2 V, -0.4 V, and -0.6 V vs. NHE. Capacitance and resistance elements obtained from the simulated equivalent circuit illustrated in Fig. S7 according to the applied bias.which supports the hypothesis that the CO 2 interacts directly with the traps, promoting the charge transfer from these intermediate energy levels. It is important to stress that the electrochemical impedance behavior of TNTA films described in the literature diverges one from another according to the film properties and the experimental conditions used during the measurements.So, there is no expected standardized profile for TNTA in general.Also, it is not usual to perform the analysis in CO 2 saturated electrolyte.This implies that a further systematic study should be performed to a better comprehension of these findings by changing the type of gas purged into the electrolyte, testing other pH solutions, and performing under UV-light light irradiation.Regarding this preliminary set of experiments, these EIS results can be summarized as follows: the processes at the electrode surface are affected by (i) the applied potential (more or less negative than the flat band potential of the material), and by (ii) the type of the adsorbent species since the presence and absence of CO 2 molecules were analyzed.This latter factor is the first evidence about the interaction of CO 2 species with the am-TNTA film. Upon studying the characteristics of the synthesized am-TNTA photocatalyst film, the CO 2 photoreduction experiment in the water vapor at 39 C was conducted under UV light irradiation while the CH 4 production was monitored by GC each 30 min for 4 h.Fig. 8A shows the CO 2 photocatalytic reduction activity of the fresh catalyst.The CH 4 production increased with time at a constant rate of 14.0 0.7 mol g cat -1 h -1 .This is a remarkable result for an amorphous nanostructured thinfilm catalyst produced in a fast one-step synthesis without modification.This enhanced photocatalytic activity can be attributed to the surface defects of the amorphous structure, mainly OH groups acting as electron traps and increasing the electron lifetime, as will be discussed in the sequence. After the first batch of the experiment, the am-TNTA film was removed from the reactor, dried at room temperature, and labeled as 'used-catalyst'.The CO 2 reduction experiment was repeated five times over the used catalyst.The results are depicted in Fig. 8B, which shows the CH 4 production rate in the six consequently runs using the same catalyst.The rate of CH 4 production varied in the range 13.7-14.01mol g cat -1 h -1 .The small and approximately constant error bars demonstrated the high stability of catalyst for CO 2 reduction into methane during six reaction cycles.This stability is similar to those reported for the crystalline TNTA films (Kar et al., 2019) and other TiO 2 -based catalysts like the amorphous TiO 2 NH 2 -MIL-125(Ti) film (Hu et al., 2020) and black titania powders (Yin et al., 2017), which exhibited good reproducibility in consecutive experiments of the CO conversion to CH 4 without no significant reduction of photocatalytic activity during 4-6 reaction cycles. The CH 4 production rate in CO 2 photoreduction reaction with water using different TiO 2 catalysts is shown in Table 3.It is important to stress that a direct comparison is not recommended due to the differences in the light irradiation, photocatalytic experimental conditions, and catalyst form (film and powder); however, these values work as a reference for the CH 4 yield.The average CH 4 production rate of 14.0 mol g cat h -1 obtained in this study for the am-TNTA film can be considered an impressive CH 4 production rate for a pure TiO 2 with no modification, no doping, no other materials added, and no heat treatment.As a reference, it can be seen that the pure anatase TiO 2 powder (commercial Degussa P25) as photocatalyst for CO 2 conversion to methane under UV irradiation exhibited a CH 4 production rate of 4.11 mol g cat -1 h -1 (Lo et al., 2007).Regarding TNTA films, Kar et al. (2019) tunned the type of heat treatment and electrolyte composition to teste anatase, rutile, and anatase/rutile mixtures for CO 2 reduction under solar simulated irradiation obtaining different methane yields.Using their values as a reference, the CH 4 production rate for the am-TNTA under UV irradiation (this work) is more similar to those observed for anatase TNTA under the solar simulated light (Kar et al., 2019).However, the photocatalytic activity of the crystalline TNTA was attributed to the presence of Ti 3 states and oxygen vacancies produced by the annealing treatment used to sensitize the material to visible light.Herein, the photocatalytic activity of the amorphous semiconductor is attributed to the surface defects (OH groups) acting as electron traps for reducing charge recombination.The UV-vis absorption spectrum (Fig. 3) showed that the am-TNTA can absorb partially under visible light irradiation, demonstrating that the material prepared in a one-step synthetic route also has the potential to convert CO 2 to CH 4 under solar simulated light. A possible reaction pathway for CO 2 conversion to CH 4 occurring at the am-TNTA film surface is illustrated in Fig. 9.The position of the conduction band (-0.4 V vs. NHE) was determined by Mott-Schottky analysis, and the position of the valence band (2.7 V vs. NHE) was calculated from the bandgap (3.10 eV) obtained by the Tauc plot (Fig. 3).This indicates that the counter-reaction taking place to compensate the photogenerated holes is most likely the oxidation of water to produce O 2 (Bolts and Wrighton, 1976;Al Jitan et al., 2020).spectra exhibit a similar profile, with slight changes.It is important to stress the Ti substrate naturally oxide in the air forming a thin TiO 2 layer in the nanometer range.Due to this thin TiO 2 layer covering the bare Ti, a similar profile between Ti substrate and am-TNTA was expected, except for the bonds involving N, C, and F adsorbed from the electrolyte during the synthesis.Notably, the three spectra exhibit a wide broadband from 2700 to 3700 cm -1 indicating the presence of hydroxyl groups (Erdem et al., 2001).Amino groups are generally detected in this interval; however, the hydroxyl broadband could hide them.Therefore, the identification of the N-H bond in this region is inconclusive.Nonetheless, the low-intensity bands in 1070 and 1442 cm -1 in the am-TNTA fresh are attributed to N-Ti-O stretching vibration and N-H stretching vibration, respectively (Li et al., 2014), indicating some N atoms incorporated into the TiO 2 structure.These bands are not observed in am-TNTA used, suggesting an N leaching from the film.The bending vibration of the O-H bond is observed in 1654, 1632, and cm -1 for Ti substrate, am-TNTA fresh, and am-TNTA used. The low-intensity bands observed in 2114-2200 cm -1 interval in the am-TNTA used might be associated with carbonate/carboxylate species generated by interaction with the catalyst, as proposed by Neat u et al., 2014).However, these bands are also observed with lower intensity in Ti substrate, which might indicate carbonyl groups absorbed from the air over the metallic substrate.Bands at 873 and 888 cm -1 observed in Ti substrate and am-TNTA used are assigned to Ti-O stretching bands.In the FTIR spectra of the am-TNTA fresh, this band is overlapped by another broadband in 700-900 cm -1 interval with a maximum at cm -1 that can be attributed to carbon skeleton vibrations of the ethylene glycol (Leon et al., 2017) incorporated from the electrolyte into TNTA surface that could leach the film after use. The am-TNTA stability before and after recycling was evaluated by FTIR, XPS, and PL techniques.The spectra for the fresh and used catalyst are shown in Fig. S8.As discussed in Section 3.1, the Ti 2p spectrum of the fresh catalyst corresponds to the chemical state Ti 4 .The relative intensity and position of the peaks remained unchanged in the used catalyst XPS spectrum (Fig. S8-B).The XPS spectrum of O 1s (Fig. S8 C-D) revealed the presence of hydroxyl groups or water (Hao et al., 2019).The relative intensity of these peaks is almost constant in the used catalyst.The C 1s spectra (Fig. S8 E-F) indicates peaks related to C-C, C-O, and COOH (Zaleska et al., 2008), originating from the Ethylene glycol used in the preparation of the am-TNTA film.Notably, no heat treatment was done on the synthesized catalyst.However, the relative intensity of the C 1s spectrum remains almost constant in the used catalyst compared to the fresh catalyst, which is in agreement with the photocatalytic reduction results confirming that the produced methane is not originated from this carbon source but CO 2 .The XPS wide spectrum (Fig. S8 G-H) also shows the presence of a small amount of F and N, which are originated from the NH 4 F salt employed in the synthesis of the am-TNTA film. The PL spectra of fresh and used catalysts until the fourth cycle are illustrated in Fig. 11.The emission spectra were collected with excitation at 325 nm wavelength and revealed that the am-TNTA does not present a broadband emission, but several peaks in the whole range of wavelength, indicating multiphononic processes.This behavior, observed for the fresh and used catalyst, was reported in other studies from the literature (Bavykin et al., 2005;Vijayan et al., 2012).In the PL properties of colloidal TiO 2 nanotubes produced by the alkali hydrothermal method (Bavykin et al., 2005), many sharp peaks were observed in the 300-700 nm range.The authors attributed the sharp bands to the low energy states as residual cations incorporated in the material during the synthesis.A similar feature was reported for TiO 2 nanotubes and carbon nanotubes composites (Vijayan et al., 2012).Usually, these sharp bands in PL spectra of semiconductors are attributed to transitions involving impurities states, doping, and the existence of trap states in bandgap promoted by defects.In other PL spectra of TNTA films, broadbands emission was observed and deconvoluted into many emission peaks in the whole range of emission wavelength (Siuzdak et al. 2015a(Siuzdak et al. , 2015b)).The authors suggested that the presence of several peaks in the PL spectrum of TiO 2 nanotubes could have resulted from the existence of sub-bandgap states in the complex structure of nanotubes (Siuzdak et al., 2015b). This behavior implies that several paths for the emission due to the high density of electronic states caused by defects (Mendez-Galvan et al., 2021).These peaks confirm the presence of many deep and shallow surface states, which could enhance the separation of electron/hole pairs and decrease the recombination rate of photoexcited charge carriers (Wang et al., 2018).These defects can be promoted by different oxygen defects like mono-ionized oxygen vacancies (shallow defects) and double-ionized oxygen vacancies (deep defects) formed as a consequence of doping/modification or heat treatment, or they can be caused by hydroxyl/water groups which can trap the electrons and act as shallow acceptor levels (Kharade and Chang, 2020;Mendez-Galvan et al., 2021).For the am-TNTA film, FTIR, XPS, and EIS results evidence that these defects are probably caused by the hydroxyl groups acting as a trap for the CO 2 via formation of carbonate species.On the other hand, the results showed a small absorption of the am-TNTA in the visible light region (Fig. 3) that can be attributed to N incorporated into the film during the synthesis, as suggested by other authors (Li et al., 2010), which can act as impurities in the synthesized material, creating sub-bandgap states. Regarding the intensity of the emission peak, some factors might be contributed to a low emission peak of the am-TNTA film.Since the film was grown on a titanium conductive substrate, the separation of charge carriers due to the transfer of electrons to the conductive substrate could suppress the intensity of PL emission.Another factor is the amorphous character of the am-TNTA.Crystalline semiconductors are expected to exhibit high intensity PL due to their low recombination radioactive when compared with the amorphous. Furthermore, the PL spectra of the used catalyst slightly declined when compared to the fresh catalyst.This minor decrease could result from the adsorption of either reactants or products on the catalyst.Stevanovic et al. (2012) studied the effect of several adsorbed molecules on the PL spectrum of TiO 2 .They found that adsorption of either electron donor or electron acceptor species decreases the PL intensity of the TiO 2 catalyst.The reduction in the PL intensity was related to the band bending and formation of the depletion layer.However, the reduction in the PL intensity in Fig. 11 is insignificant, which agrees with the catalyst stability for methane formation in the repeated experiments. In correspondence to the PL analysis, the C 1s spectrum of XPS (Fig. S8 E-F) does not indicate any noticeable change in the amount of carbon on the catalyst surface.Also, the presence of the irreversible adsorbed oxygenated intermediates or products on the surface of the film should change the O 1s XPS high-resolution spectrum, which has remained almost unchanged in the used catalyst compared to the fresh catalyst.Therefore, the prepared am-TNTA film is highly stable for CO 2 photocatalytic reduction. It is important to discuss some aspects about the findings correlating all data.The results show that photocatalytic activity of the am-TNTA film in the CO 2 reduction to CH 4 can be explained in terms of defects caused by the surface hydroxyl species.Traps are electronic energy levels located in the bandgap of a semiconductor and are involved in the charge-transfer process (Wang et al., 2001).It includes surface states, oxygen vacancies, adsorbed species.Shallow defects are energetically closed to CB or VB, whereas deep defects are energetically closed to the Fermi level (Mendez-Galvan et al., 2021).A nanostructured morphology like the TNTA presents a large number of electron traps at the surface and the grain boundaries, influencing the interfacial kinetics of the transfer processes.The detrapping is possible for these shallow traps, but the deep (bulk) traps can immobilize carriers irreversibly (Wehrenfennig et al., 2015), compromising the charge transfer processes.This is the main reason for the short anodizing time chosen in the synthesis in this study.A longer anodizing time would produce a longer nanotube length, where the light could penetrate deeply, reaching the bulk traps and, consequently, reducing the efficiency of the photocatalytic process. Among these defects, Ti 3 surface states, mono-ionized oxygen vacancies (shallow traps), and doubled-ionized oxygen vacancies (deep traps) were not evidenced in this study.On the other hand, the presence of surface hydroxyl groups was evidenced by FTIR and XPS analysis of am-TNTA film.Hydroxyl groups are considered dominant sites for trapping electrons acting as shallow acceptor levels (Mendez-Galvan et al., 2021).PL spectra (Fig. 11) showed many states attributed to shallow defects that can be promoted by these hydroxyl/water groups.In the case of CO 2 photoreduction, the hydroxyl groups act like traps via formation of the carbonate species (Kharade and Chang, 2020), as suggested by the analysis of the electrochemical data.Therefore, since CO 2 interacts directly with the traps, forming carbonate species, we can assume that, in the am-TNTA film, the charge is transferred directly from these shallow levels.To evaluate the effect of the deep defects of am-TNTA film on the photocatalytic activity in CO 2 reduction, further studies are necessary by fabricating the am-TNTA with different thicknesses, nanotube diameter, and nanotube walls.This study will also be important to verify if the charge carriers from different trap states are homogeneously distributed along the nanotube length and diameter.The effect of these defects on the selectivity towards specific products also should be addressed. The main consequence of these traps is the increase of the electron lifetime, favoring the photocatalytic activity of the am-TNTA and preventing them from charge recombination.The recombination of charge carriers (electron/hole pairs) is a major challenge in developing an efficient photocatalyst.The lifetime of photoexcited electrons and holes is estimated to be in the order of 10 -9 s, while the CO 2 reduction reaction requires a longer time (Fan et al., 2013).Therefore, any change which could decrease the recombination rate of electrons and holes will significantly improve the photocatalytic reduction efficiency.Moreover, metals generally have lower Fermi energies than semiconductors which implies that electrons transfer from the semiconductor to the metal.This flow of electrons will lead to the formation of the Schottky barrier at the interface of the conductor/semiconductor that functions as an effective electron trap.Consequently, the formation of the Schottky barrier will increase the lifetime of the excited electrons, which is essential for developing an efficient photocatalyst (Khan et al., 2015).However, it is important to stress that the charge transfer processes in the amorphous material are not faster as the crystalline TiO 2 .Therefore, this is a factor that also should be addressed in the development of the catalyst."}, {"llm generation": "Liquid (phosphate buffer media)", "source": "Therefore, the electrochemical characterization of the am-TNTA was performed in phosphate buffer media by CV and EIS techniques.", "context": "The anodization of Titanium and other valve metals is a well-known technique used to produce nanostructured oxide films (Lee et al., 2014;Indira et al., 2015;Trivinho-Strixino et al., 2017).These nanomaterials are extensively explored in numerous applications in energy, biological and environmental fields due to their facile synthesis with environmental-friendly experimental conditions (mild temperature and low-toxicity reagents) and control of morphology, composition, and structure by the synthetic parameters (Santos et al., 2021).Additionally, the resulting oxides coatings exhibit high surface area per volume, chemical stability, and rigid adhesion between metal and oxide layer, avoiding the use of binder agents. The fabrication of the TNTA via the anodization technique consists of three main steps: preparing the metallic substrate, the anodizing, and the heat treatment.For most applications, anodizing and heat treatment require longer times.The anodizing time can vary from 20 min to 24 h (Santos et al., 2021).The production of nanotubes with a large length and high-aspect ratio requires long anodizing times.Besides, to obtain a high-ordered array, two anodization steps might be necessary.The heat treatment is usually performed at 450-600 C for 1-3 h, disregarding the warm-up and cooling steps, which require additional hours. In the Ti anodization, the TNTA films are grown on the surface of Ti substrates by the anodic oxidation of Ti metallic to TiO 2 , usually in organic media containing fluoride ions.The morphology of the nanostructured film is controlled by the anodizing conditions, i. e. the applied voltage, temperature, electrolyte composition, and anodizing time (Trivinho-Strixino et al., 2017).Applied voltage, for instance, tends to influence the nanotube inner diameter, whereas the temperature, water, and fluoride content can affect the dimensions and shape of the nanotube walls.Anodizing time usually influences the nanotube length (Vargas et al., 2019).In this study, considering that only the outermost surface layer of the amorphous catalyst is active for CO 2 photoreduction, the samples were anodizing for 30 min to produce a thinner film.This approach avoids that the light penetrating too deep inside into the am-TNTA film since traps in the bulk of the material can compromise the reduction and oxidation potential of the electrons and holes, inhibiting transport and charge transfer (Baccaro and Gutz, 2018). Therefore, TNTA films were grown over Ti substrate via potentiostatic anodization at 50 V for 30 min in Ethylene glycol media containing 0.75 wt.NH 4 F and 10 vol.Water.The same anodizing conditions (except the anodized area) were used for all the samples used in this study.The current transients were monitored to assure the experiments repeatability and, consequently, the homogeneity of the material properties in the samples with different anodized areas (see SI file for details). Fig. 1A depicts the current density vs. time curve, divided into three typical regions (Ferreira et al., 2019).Region I is characterized by the abrupt drop of the current density in the early stages of the anodization (0-15 s) until reaching a minimum value denoted by point a in the inset of Fig. 1A.This current reduction is promoted by the formation of the compact oxide film, namely barrier oxide, which increases the resistance of the system (Trivinho-Strixino et al., 2017).In region II, nucleation of the nanotubes takes place.Since the formation of open channels in the oxide offers less resistive pathways, the current density rises with the increase of the surface area of the oxide until achieving point b, where the pores achieve their maximum diameter.After this point, the oxide grows in the bottom of the nanotube, that is, into the metal/oxide interface, resulting in the enlargement of the oxide layer and the nanotube length.Simultaneously to the oxide growth reaction, fluoride ions in the electrolytic medium are promoting the dissolution of the oxide via TiF 6 -2 complex formation (Ghicov and Schmuki, 2009).In region III, the oxide formation reaction and dissolution process reach a steady-state resulting in the vertical growth of the nanotubular structure of TiO 2 .The stages of the oxide layer formation over the titanium substrate monitored by the anodization curve (Fig. 1A) are illustrated in Fig. 1B.This schematic illustration shows the steps of titanium anodic oxidation, including the barrier oxide film formation, pores nucleation, and nanotubes growth into the substrate. Fig. 1C shows the nanotubular structure of the am-TNTA surface obtained by SEM.The nanotubes inner diameter presented values in the 80-120 nm range, with an average value of 100 10 nm, wall NT thickness of 26 5 nm, and a void distance between the nanotubes of 12 9 nm.The nanotube length values ranging from 3.4 to 3.9 m were determined from the SEM side view of the sample (Fig. 1D) obtained in different positions.The average thickness of 3.7 0.3 m found is similar to other TNTA films synthesized under similar conditions reported in the literature (Atyaoui et al., 2013;Hao et al., 2019).Table 1 depicts the compositional analysis of the oxide layer obtained by EDX (see the full table in Supporting Information for more details).The semi-quantitative analysis shows Ti and O elements as majority composition, as expected for the TiO 2 layers, with 33.30 At. and 45.25 At., respectively.N, F and C species from the electrolyte composed of NH 4 F and Ethylene glycol were incorporated into the film in minor quantities.The homogenous distribution of the elements along the am-TNTA surface is shown in Fig. S3. The TNTA films produced by the anodization technique under low voltages (10-60 V) are typically amorphous (Simon et al., 2019(Simon et al., , 2021)), although some authors reported traces of the anatase phase in the film synthetized at 40 V in a glycerol-based electrolyte (Macak et al., 2008).Therefore, for a full oxide crystallization, heat treatment in temperatures above 400 C is necessary (Ghicov and Schmuki, 2009;Indira et al., 2015;Santos et al., 2021).In this study, the focus is on evaluating the photocatalytic activity and stability of the amorphous material; then, the TNTA samples were used as anodized.Fig. 2 depicts the diffractograms of the metallic titanium substrate, the am-TNTA sample, and an anodized TNTA sample produced under the exact anodizing conditions, which was annealed at 450 C under air for 2 h at a 7 C min -1 heating rate.After being maintained at 450 C for 2 h in the tube furnace, the sample was cooling down to room temperature naturally. The diffractogram of the metallic Ti exhibits the Bragg peaks of the hexagonal phase according to PDF 00-044-1294 (Sailer and McCarthy, 1993), where the main peak ( 101) is observed at 40.2 .Other characteristic peaks of this metallic phase are (100) at 35.1 , (002) at 38.4 , (102) at 53 , (103) at 70.7 .These peaks are also observed in the pattern of the annealed TNTA, which reveals a mixture of hexagonal Ti and anatase TiO 2 phase, indicating that the X-ray beam reached the substrate during the scan.The main peaks of the anatase phase are indicated in the second diffractogram according to PDF 01-086-1157 (Sanchez et al., 1996), where the most intensity peak ( 101) is observed at 25.3 .Other characteristic peaks of the anatase phase are (004) at 37.9 , (200) at 48 , (105) at 54.0 , and (211) at 55.1 .The diffractogram of the am-TNTA sample was performed using a small scattering angle to minimize the effect of the metallic substrate.Its pattern is characterized by broader low-intensity peaks and a deviation from the baseline at 2 range from 10 to 35 ; a larger deviation at low 2 when compared with the other two diffractograms.The baseline deviation, broader peaks, or absence of peaks are typical for amorphous material since the crystalline materials present a regular and straight baseline, and well-defined and sharp Bragg peaks (Cullity and Stock, 2001).The broader peak around 25 (101), 37 (004), and 48 (200) in the am-TNTA diffractogram may indicate the presence of the anatase phase in a small extension.Different from powders, the crystallographic orientation of the substrate can influence the nucleation of small crystals in films during the oxide growth.However, the quantity is too small to attribute some crystalline character to the material, as reported by other authors (Macak et al., 2008).Therefore, XRD results demonstrate that TNTA without annealing is predominantly amorphous. Fig. 3 depicts the absorption spectrum of the TNTA film, where it can be seen that the semiconductor majority absorbs in the UV spectra range (390 nm).However, a small but significant absorption is also observed in the visible range (400-700 nm).Table 1 showed that am-TNTA film has 9.92 at. of N in its composition incorporated from NH 4 F content in the electrolyte during the anodization.This N content can exert some contribution to the visible light absorption observed for the am-TNTA catalyst.The incorporated nitrogen into am-TNTA, could alter the semiconductor electronic state, creating sub-energetic states (Li et al., 2010) and enhancing its photocatalytic activity under visible light irradiation. The bandgap of 3.10 eV was determined from Tauc plot (Fig. 3 inset), which was calculated using Tauc's equation (h where is the absorption coefficient, h is Planck's constant, is the radiation frequency and is equal to the speed of light in a vacuum (c) divided by the wavelength (), A is the optical constant, E g is the optical band gap, and n was assumed as 0.5 for direct transitions (Nunez et al., 2021).This bandgap value is slightly larger than the 2.84 eV observed for the am-TNTA produced under similar anodizing conditions (Hao et al., 2019), but it is typical for TiO 2 materials (Ge et al., 2016). The XPS technique was employed to analyze the surface chemical state of the synthesized catalyst.Fig. 4A depicts the XPS wide spectrum which shows the presence of Ti, O, C and a small amount of F and N, which are originated from the NH 4 F salt employed in the synthesis of the am-TNTA film.The Ti 2p spectrum (Fig. 4B) shows two peaks positioned at 459.08 eV and 464.82 eV corresponding to Ti 2p 3/2 and Ti 2p 1/2 , respectively, attributed to the chemical state Ti 4 (Mu et al., 2012;Umer et al., 2019).The XPS spectrum of O 1s (Fig. 4C) was deconvoluted into three peaks positioned at 530.30 eV, 531.51 eV, and 533.06 eV.The peak at 530.30 eV corresponds to lattice oxygen (Ti-O bond), while the peaks at 531.51 eV and 533.06 eV correspond to hydroxyl groups or water (Hao et al., 2019).The C 1s high-resolution XPS (Fig. 4D) indicates three peaks related to C-C, C-O, and COOH (Zaleska et al., 2008), originating from the Ethylene glycol used in the preparation of the am-TNTA film. For nanostructure semiconductor electrodes, information about electronic structure can be extracted from the intrinsic semiconductor properties and the transient states of the semiconductor when it interacts with the electrolyte at a given electrode potential (Berger et al., 2012).Therefore, the electrochemical characterization of the am-TNTA was performed in phosphate buffer media by CV and EIS techniques. This approach was used to investigate the electronic properties of the film and the main processes occurring in the oxide surface. Fig. 5 depicts the cyclic voltammograms of the am-TNTA in the -0.9 V to 0.9 V (vs.NHE) potential window obtained at different scan rates in phosphate buffer solution (pH 7) saturated with N 2 and CO 2 from the starting potential of -0.1 V (vs.NHE).Under these conditions, no cathodic peaks were observed during the cathodic scan toward negative potentials.In the reverse scan, an anodic peak was observed around -0.6 V vs. NHE (at 5 mV s -1 ) in the direction of the positive potentials (Fig. 5A).This anodic peak can be attributed to the oxidation of the hydrogen previously adsorbed during water discharge in the cathodic scan or to the detrapping of the electrons that will be discussed in the sequence.This peak shifted to more positive values as the scan rates increased.The current density increased linearly with the scan rate, indicating no diffusional limitations under this condition, which implies that the system is explained by electron transfer kinetics (Bertoluzzi et al., 2013).The voltammograms in Fig. 5B follow the same tendency observed in Fig. 5A, and no significant features were observed in those profiles, except for the increase of the current density at high scan rates for the electrolyte saturated with CO 2 , which may indicate that the CO 2 affect the capacitance of the system. Therefore, for better visualization of these results, the current values were divided by the corresponded scan rate and plotted as a ratio between charge and potential, as shown in Fig. 5C-D.This shape can be interpreted as a relation between the trapping/detrapping process and the electron transfers between the trap and solution (Bertoluzzi et al., 2013).At a first view, when compared these charge/potential profiles (Fig. 5C-D) with CV profiles (Fig. 5A-B), it can be noted that the processes occurring at low scan rate (5 mV s -1 , black line) exhibited the larger variation in the charge/potential ratio, indicating that slow kinetic processes are favored. The plots from Fig. 5C-D depict four regions designated by i, ii, iii, and iv, in which processes can be described as follows: in region i, the traps are being filled as the system advances toward more negative potentials.In region ii, the main process is the electron transfer in the conduction band (CB), as shown by the Mott-Schottky plot in Fig. 6, where the band edge for the electron transfer from/to CB is identified as -0.4 V vs. NHE.From Fig. 5C-D, the fast increase of the charge/potential rate is observed just after this point (-0.4V vs. NHE).In region iii of the anodic scan, the charge transfer processes occurring are originated at the CB.Region iv is characterized by the electron transfer from the trap to the solution as the potential advances toward more positive values. In region iv (Fig. 5C-D), it notes that the electron transfer from the traps is becoming slower due to the adsorption of CO 2 ; in other words, the CO 2 adsorbed becomes a trap, which can stabilize the electron for a longer time in the electrode before it can be transferred.According to Kharade and Chang (2020), this stabilization can occur via hydroxyl groups on the surface of the amorphous TiO 2 that can act as a trap for CO 2 forming carbonate species, increasing CO 2 chemisorption.Therefore, herein the scan rate becomes an important parameter.If the process is slow, more electrons are transferred at lower scan rates.On the other hand, if the process is fast enough, no difference is observed.This factor also may explain why there is no variation of charge in the region i in CO 2 saturated electrolyte (Fig. 5D).Since the CO 2 is adsorbed, the carbonated species formed by chemisorption on the surface act as a trap for electrons, resulting in no variation of the charge in the region i (Fig. 5D). Besides the flat band potential (E fb ), identified as -0.4 V vs. NHE by extrapolation of the linear part of the Mott-Schottky plots (Fig. 6), the charge carriers density (N D ) for the am-TNTA electrode was determined from the Mott-Schottky equation (Hanzu et al., 2011), where the values of 1.2 10 -19 cm -3 and 9.3 10 -19 cm -3 were found for the measurements performed in phosphate buffer solution saturated with N 2 and CO 2 , respectively, assuming a relative permittivity of 55 for TNTA (Raza et al., 2021).These results show that the flat band potential did not change with the CO 2 purge in the electrolyte, but the charge carrier density increased.One hypothesis for the high charge carrier density is the presence of carbonate groups formed on the electrode surface by chemisorption acting like donor group and making the electrons move more freely. The Nyquist plot shows the imaginary part of the complex impedance (-Z ) as a function of the real part (Z ) of the am-TNTA electrode for different frequency values.Fig. S7 (SI file) depicts the impedance spectra for the photocatalyst at -0.2 V, -0.4 V, and -0.6 V vs. NHE.These curves represent the system under three different conditions, i.e., when the applied potential is less negative than the flat band potential (E fb ), equal to E fb , and more negative than E fb .The insets exhibit the highfrequency region, where a semicircle arc is observed in the measurement carried out in electrolyte purge with N 2 at -0.2 V vs. NHE, and its shape is related to the electrolyte resistance (Mei et al., 2018;Freitas et al., 2014).Fig. 7 shows that this semicircle was not observed clearly at more negative potentials or when CO 2 was introduced into the solution. A slight deviation at the low-frequency values was observed with the increase of the solution's resistance in the CO 2 saturated electrolyte.Regarding the different behavior as a function of the applied bias in each case, the change in the semicircle format shows the reduction of the internal resistance (electrode and electrolyte) of the system at more negative potentials. Regarding the N 2 saturation, note in Fig. 7 that the values that close the pseudo-semicircle for each applied potential has the same frequency (398 Hz).This means there is an electron transfer process taking place with that time constant, which charge transfer resistance decreases when the applied potential increase.This happens until it reaches the value of the conduction band, and the transfer from the band takes place.Besides, the frequency of the process (398 Hz 3.98 10 2 s -1 ) is similar to the one reported by Bertoluzzi et al. (5 10 2 s -1 ) (Bertoluzzi and Bisquert, 2012).For the CO 2 saturated electrolyte, the pseudo-semicircle closes at a higher frequency (1000 Hz), which means that it is a faster process overlapping the traps filling, and the electron transfer has a higher resistance. Table 2 shows the capacitance and resistance values obtained fitting the data with a simulated equivalent circuit illustrated in Fig. S7.This circuit was composed of a, b, c circuit parts with resistance and capacitance elements, where R t/d is the trapping/detrapping resistance, C dl is the double-layer capacitance, R t is the resistance of the charge transfer from the trap, C t is the capacitance of the trap, C ct is the capacitance of the charge transfer process from the band, and R ct is the charge transfer resistance from the band. The results from Table 2 showed that the resistance of the trapping/ detrapping (R t/d ) and the capacitance of the double-layer (C dl ) are approximately constant in N 2 saturated electrolyte and presented no significant variation in the CO 2 case, indicating significant changes in the trapping/detrapping mechanism with the applied potential.However, compared with N 2 saturated electrolyte, the resistance (R t/d ) values are higher in CO 2 while C dl values are small.The charge transfer resistance from the traps (R t ) decreases toward more negative potentials as the traps are being filled from the solution with N 2 , but it remained constant in CO 2 solution.The capacitance of the traps (C t ) exhibits a maximum value is at -0.2 V (vs.NHE) in both cases.These values are related to the semicircles from the Nyquist plots.As the overpotential increases (potential become more negative), the resistance of the charge transfer from the traps (R ct ) reduces while the corresponding capacitance (C ct ) increases.This indicates that the accumulation of charge is diminishing toward more negative potentials. These results show that the major effect is the CO 2 on the trap filling resistance.The traps are easily or faster filled when the CO 2 is adsorbed, Fig. 7. Detail of the high-frequency regions of the Nyquist diagrams for am-TNTA film obtained in phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.0) saturated with N 2 (right) and CO 2 (left) at -0.2 V, -0.4 V, and -0.6 V vs. NHE. Capacitance and resistance elements obtained from the simulated equivalent circuit illustrated in Fig. S7 according to the applied bias.which supports the hypothesis that the CO 2 interacts directly with the traps, promoting the charge transfer from these intermediate energy levels. It is important to stress that the electrochemical impedance behavior of TNTA films described in the literature diverges one from another according to the film properties and the experimental conditions used during the measurements.So, there is no expected standardized profile for TNTA in general.Also, it is not usual to perform the analysis in CO 2 saturated electrolyte.This implies that a further systematic study should be performed to a better comprehension of these findings by changing the type of gas purged into the electrolyte, testing other pH solutions, and performing under UV-light light irradiation.Regarding this preliminary set of experiments, these EIS results can be summarized as follows: the processes at the electrode surface are affected by (i) the applied potential (more or less negative than the flat band potential of the material), and by (ii) the type of the adsorbent species since the presence and absence of CO 2 molecules were analyzed.This latter factor is the first evidence about the interaction of CO 2 species with the am-TNTA film. Upon studying the characteristics of the synthesized am-TNTA photocatalyst film, the CO 2 photoreduction experiment in the water vapor at 39 C was conducted under UV light irradiation while the CH 4 production was monitored by GC each 30 min for 4 h.Fig. 8A shows the CO 2 photocatalytic reduction activity of the fresh catalyst.The CH 4 production increased with time at a constant rate of 14.0 0.7 mol g cat -1 h -1 .This is a remarkable result for an amorphous nanostructured thinfilm catalyst produced in a fast one-step synthesis without modification.This enhanced photocatalytic activity can be attributed to the surface defects of the amorphous structure, mainly OH groups acting as electron traps and increasing the electron lifetime, as will be discussed in the sequence. After the first batch of the experiment, the am-TNTA film was removed from the reactor, dried at room temperature, and labeled as 'used-catalyst'.The CO 2 reduction experiment was repeated five times over the used catalyst.The results are depicted in Fig. 8B, which shows the CH 4 production rate in the six consequently runs using the same catalyst.The rate of CH 4 production varied in the range 13.7-14.01mol g cat -1 h -1 .The small and approximately constant error bars demonstrated the high stability of catalyst for CO 2 reduction into methane during six reaction cycles.This stability is similar to those reported for the crystalline TNTA films (Kar et al., 2019) and other TiO 2 -based catalysts like the amorphous TiO 2 NH 2 -MIL-125(Ti) film (Hu et al., 2020) and black titania powders (Yin et al., 2017), which exhibited good reproducibility in consecutive experiments of the CO conversion to CH 4 without no significant reduction of photocatalytic activity during 4-6 reaction cycles. The CH 4 production rate in CO 2 photoreduction reaction with water using different TiO 2 catalysts is shown in Table 3.It is important to stress that a direct comparison is not recommended due to the differences in the light irradiation, photocatalytic experimental conditions, and catalyst form (film and powder); however, these values work as a reference for the CH 4 yield.The average CH 4 production rate of 14.0 mol g cat h -1 obtained in this study for the am-TNTA film can be considered an impressive CH 4 production rate for a pure TiO 2 with no modification, no doping, no other materials added, and no heat treatment.As a reference, it can be seen that the pure anatase TiO 2 powder (commercial Degussa P25) as photocatalyst for CO 2 conversion to methane under UV irradiation exhibited a CH 4 production rate of 4.11 mol g cat -1 h -1 (Lo et al., 2007).Regarding TNTA films, Kar et al. (2019) tunned the type of heat treatment and electrolyte composition to teste anatase, rutile, and anatase/rutile mixtures for CO 2 reduction under solar simulated irradiation obtaining different methane yields.Using their values as a reference, the CH 4 production rate for the am-TNTA under UV irradiation (this work) is more similar to those observed for anatase TNTA under the solar simulated light (Kar et al., 2019).However, the photocatalytic activity of the crystalline TNTA was attributed to the presence of Ti 3 states and oxygen vacancies produced by the annealing treatment used to sensitize the material to visible light.Herein, the photocatalytic activity of the amorphous semiconductor is attributed to the surface defects (OH groups) acting as electron traps for reducing charge recombination.The UV-vis absorption spectrum (Fig. 3) showed that the am-TNTA can absorb partially under visible light irradiation, demonstrating that the material prepared in a one-step synthetic route also has the potential to convert CO 2 to CH 4 under solar simulated light. A possible reaction pathway for CO 2 conversion to CH 4 occurring at the am-TNTA film surface is illustrated in Fig. 9.The position of the conduction band (-0.4 V vs. NHE) was determined by Mott-Schottky analysis, and the position of the valence band (2.7 V vs. NHE) was calculated from the bandgap (3.10 eV) obtained by the Tauc plot (Fig. 3).This indicates that the counter-reaction taking place to compensate the photogenerated holes is most likely the oxidation of water to produce O 2 (Bolts and Wrighton, 1976;Al Jitan et al., 2020).spectra exhibit a similar profile, with slight changes.It is important to stress the Ti substrate naturally oxide in the air forming a thin TiO 2 layer in the nanometer range.Due to this thin TiO 2 layer covering the bare Ti, a similar profile between Ti substrate and am-TNTA was expected, except for the bonds involving N, C, and F adsorbed from the electrolyte during the synthesis.Notably, the three spectra exhibit a wide broadband from 2700 to 3700 cm -1 indicating the presence of hydroxyl groups (Erdem et al., 2001).Amino groups are generally detected in this interval; however, the hydroxyl broadband could hide them.Therefore, the identification of the N-H bond in this region is inconclusive.Nonetheless, the low-intensity bands in 1070 and 1442 cm -1 in the am-TNTA fresh are attributed to N-Ti-O stretching vibration and N-H stretching vibration, respectively (Li et al., 2014), indicating some N atoms incorporated into the TiO 2 structure.These bands are not observed in am-TNTA used, suggesting an N leaching from the film.The bending vibration of the O-H bond is observed in 1654, 1632, and cm -1 for Ti substrate, am-TNTA fresh, and am-TNTA used. The low-intensity bands observed in 2114-2200 cm -1 interval in the am-TNTA used might be associated with carbonate/carboxylate species generated by interaction with the catalyst, as proposed by Neat u et al., 2014).However, these bands are also observed with lower intensity in Ti substrate, which might indicate carbonyl groups absorbed from the air over the metallic substrate.Bands at 873 and 888 cm -1 observed in Ti substrate and am-TNTA used are assigned to Ti-O stretching bands.In the FTIR spectra of the am-TNTA fresh, this band is overlapped by another broadband in 700-900 cm -1 interval with a maximum at cm -1 that can be attributed to carbon skeleton vibrations of the ethylene glycol (Leon et al., 2017) incorporated from the electrolyte into TNTA surface that could leach the film after use. The am-TNTA stability before and after recycling was evaluated by FTIR, XPS, and PL techniques.The spectra for the fresh and used catalyst are shown in Fig. S8.As discussed in Section 3.1, the Ti 2p spectrum of the fresh catalyst corresponds to the chemical state Ti 4 .The relative intensity and position of the peaks remained unchanged in the used catalyst XPS spectrum (Fig. S8-B).The XPS spectrum of O 1s (Fig. S8 C-D) revealed the presence of hydroxyl groups or water (Hao et al., 2019).The relative intensity of these peaks is almost constant in the used catalyst.The C 1s spectra (Fig. S8 E-F) indicates peaks related to C-C, C-O, and COOH (Zaleska et al., 2008), originating from the Ethylene glycol used in the preparation of the am-TNTA film.Notably, no heat treatment was done on the synthesized catalyst.However, the relative intensity of the C 1s spectrum remains almost constant in the used catalyst compared to the fresh catalyst, which is in agreement with the photocatalytic reduction results confirming that the produced methane is not originated from this carbon source but CO 2 .The XPS wide spectrum (Fig. S8 G-H) also shows the presence of a small amount of F and N, which are originated from the NH 4 F salt employed in the synthesis of the am-TNTA film. The PL spectra of fresh and used catalysts until the fourth cycle are illustrated in Fig. 11.The emission spectra were collected with excitation at 325 nm wavelength and revealed that the am-TNTA does not present a broadband emission, but several peaks in the whole range of wavelength, indicating multiphononic processes.This behavior, observed for the fresh and used catalyst, was reported in other studies from the literature (Bavykin et al., 2005;Vijayan et al., 2012).In the PL properties of colloidal TiO 2 nanotubes produced by the alkali hydrothermal method (Bavykin et al., 2005), many sharp peaks were observed in the 300-700 nm range.The authors attributed the sharp bands to the low energy states as residual cations incorporated in the material during the synthesis.A similar feature was reported for TiO 2 nanotubes and carbon nanotubes composites (Vijayan et al., 2012).Usually, these sharp bands in PL spectra of semiconductors are attributed to transitions involving impurities states, doping, and the existence of trap states in bandgap promoted by defects.In other PL spectra of TNTA films, broadbands emission was observed and deconvoluted into many emission peaks in the whole range of emission wavelength (Siuzdak et al. 2015a(Siuzdak et al. , 2015b)).The authors suggested that the presence of several peaks in the PL spectrum of TiO 2 nanotubes could have resulted from the existence of sub-bandgap states in the complex structure of nanotubes (Siuzdak et al., 2015b). This behavior implies that several paths for the emission due to the high density of electronic states caused by defects (Mendez-Galvan et al., 2021).These peaks confirm the presence of many deep and shallow surface states, which could enhance the separation of electron/hole pairs and decrease the recombination rate of photoexcited charge carriers (Wang et al., 2018).These defects can be promoted by different oxygen defects like mono-ionized oxygen vacancies (shallow defects) and double-ionized oxygen vacancies (deep defects) formed as a consequence of doping/modification or heat treatment, or they can be caused by hydroxyl/water groups which can trap the electrons and act as shallow acceptor levels (Kharade and Chang, 2020;Mendez-Galvan et al., 2021).For the am-TNTA film, FTIR, XPS, and EIS results evidence that these defects are probably caused by the hydroxyl groups acting as a trap for the CO 2 via formation of carbonate species.On the other hand, the results showed a small absorption of the am-TNTA in the visible light region (Fig. 3) that can be attributed to N incorporated into the film during the synthesis, as suggested by other authors (Li et al., 2010), which can act as impurities in the synthesized material, creating sub-bandgap states. Regarding the intensity of the emission peak, some factors might be contributed to a low emission peak of the am-TNTA film.Since the film was grown on a titanium conductive substrate, the separation of charge carriers due to the transfer of electrons to the conductive substrate could suppress the intensity of PL emission.Another factor is the amorphous character of the am-TNTA.Crystalline semiconductors are expected to exhibit high intensity PL due to their low recombination radioactive when compared with the amorphous. Furthermore, the PL spectra of the used catalyst slightly declined when compared to the fresh catalyst.This minor decrease could result from the adsorption of either reactants or products on the catalyst.Stevanovic et al. (2012) studied the effect of several adsorbed molecules on the PL spectrum of TiO 2 .They found that adsorption of either electron donor or electron acceptor species decreases the PL intensity of the TiO 2 catalyst.The reduction in the PL intensity was related to the band bending and formation of the depletion layer.However, the reduction in the PL intensity in Fig. 11 is insignificant, which agrees with the catalyst stability for methane formation in the repeated experiments. In correspondence to the PL analysis, the C 1s spectrum of XPS (Fig. S8 E-F) does not indicate any noticeable change in the amount of carbon on the catalyst surface.Also, the presence of the irreversible adsorbed oxygenated intermediates or products on the surface of the film should change the O 1s XPS high-resolution spectrum, which has remained almost unchanged in the used catalyst compared to the fresh catalyst.Therefore, the prepared am-TNTA film is highly stable for CO 2 photocatalytic reduction. It is important to discuss some aspects about the findings correlating all data.The results show that photocatalytic activity of the am-TNTA film in the CO 2 reduction to CH 4 can be explained in terms of defects caused by the surface hydroxyl species.Traps are electronic energy levels located in the bandgap of a semiconductor and are involved in the charge-transfer process (Wang et al., 2001).It includes surface states, oxygen vacancies, adsorbed species.Shallow defects are energetically closed to CB or VB, whereas deep defects are energetically closed to the Fermi level (Mendez-Galvan et al., 2021).A nanostructured morphology like the TNTA presents a large number of electron traps at the surface and the grain boundaries, influencing the interfacial kinetics of the transfer processes.The detrapping is possible for these shallow traps, but the deep (bulk) traps can immobilize carriers irreversibly (Wehrenfennig et al., 2015), compromising the charge transfer processes.This is the main reason for the short anodizing time chosen in the synthesis in this study.A longer anodizing time would produce a longer nanotube length, where the light could penetrate deeply, reaching the bulk traps and, consequently, reducing the efficiency of the photocatalytic process. Among these defects, Ti 3 surface states, mono-ionized oxygen vacancies (shallow traps), and doubled-ionized oxygen vacancies (deep traps) were not evidenced in this study.On the other hand, the presence of surface hydroxyl groups was evidenced by FTIR and XPS analysis of am-TNTA film.Hydroxyl groups are considered dominant sites for trapping electrons acting as shallow acceptor levels (Mendez-Galvan et al., 2021).PL spectra (Fig. 11) showed many states attributed to shallow defects that can be promoted by these hydroxyl/water groups.In the case of CO 2 photoreduction, the hydroxyl groups act like traps via formation of the carbonate species (Kharade and Chang, 2020), as suggested by the analysis of the electrochemical data.Therefore, since CO 2 interacts directly with the traps, forming carbonate species, we can assume that, in the am-TNTA film, the charge is transferred directly from these shallow levels.To evaluate the effect of the deep defects of am-TNTA film on the photocatalytic activity in CO 2 reduction, further studies are necessary by fabricating the am-TNTA with different thicknesses, nanotube diameter, and nanotube walls.This study will also be important to verify if the charge carriers from different trap states are homogeneously distributed along the nanotube length and diameter.The effect of these defects on the selectivity towards specific products also should be addressed. The main consequence of these traps is the increase of the electron lifetime, favoring the photocatalytic activity of the am-TNTA and preventing them from charge recombination.The recombination of charge carriers (electron/hole pairs) is a major challenge in developing an efficient photocatalyst.The lifetime of photoexcited electrons and holes is estimated to be in the order of 10 -9 s, while the CO 2 reduction reaction requires a longer time (Fan et al., 2013).Therefore, any change which could decrease the recombination rate of electrons and holes will significantly improve the photocatalytic reduction efficiency.Moreover, metals generally have lower Fermi energies than semiconductors which implies that electrons transfer from the semiconductor to the metal.This flow of electrons will lead to the formation of the Schottky barrier at the interface of the conductor/semiconductor that functions as an effective electron trap.Consequently, the formation of the Schottky barrier will increase the lifetime of the excited electrons, which is essential for developing an efficient photocatalyst (Khan et al., 2015).However, it is important to stress that the charge transfer processes in the amorphous material are not faster as the crystalline TiO 2 .Therefore, this is a factor that also should be addressed in the development of the catalyst."}, {"llm generation": "Liquid (phosphate buffer solution (pH 7) saturated with N 2 and CO 2)", "source": "Fig. 5 depicts the cyclic voltammograms of the am-TNTA in the -0.9 V to 0.9 V (vs.NHE) potential window obtained at different scan rates in phosphate buffer solution (pH 7) saturated with N 2 and CO 2 from the starting potential of -0.1 V (vs.NHE).", "context": "The anodization of Titanium and other valve metals is a well-known technique used to produce nanostructured oxide films (Lee et al., 2014;Indira et al., 2015;Trivinho-Strixino et al., 2017).These nanomaterials are extensively explored in numerous applications in energy, biological and environmental fields due to their facile synthesis with environmental-friendly experimental conditions (mild temperature and low-toxicity reagents) and control of morphology, composition, and structure by the synthetic parameters (Santos et al., 2021).Additionally, the resulting oxides coatings exhibit high surface area per volume, chemical stability, and rigid adhesion between metal and oxide layer, avoiding the use of binder agents. The fabrication of the TNTA via the anodization technique consists of three main steps: preparing the metallic substrate, the anodizing, and the heat treatment.For most applications, anodizing and heat treatment require longer times.The anodizing time can vary from 20 min to 24 h (Santos et al., 2021).The production of nanotubes with a large length and high-aspect ratio requires long anodizing times.Besides, to obtain a high-ordered array, two anodization steps might be necessary.The heat treatment is usually performed at 450-600 C for 1-3 h, disregarding the warm-up and cooling steps, which require additional hours. In the Ti anodization, the TNTA films are grown on the surface of Ti substrates by the anodic oxidation of Ti metallic to TiO 2 , usually in organic media containing fluoride ions.The morphology of the nanostructured film is controlled by the anodizing conditions, i. e. the applied voltage, temperature, electrolyte composition, and anodizing time (Trivinho-Strixino et al., 2017).Applied voltage, for instance, tends to influence the nanotube inner diameter, whereas the temperature, water, and fluoride content can affect the dimensions and shape of the nanotube walls.Anodizing time usually influences the nanotube length (Vargas et al., 2019).In this study, considering that only the outermost surface layer of the amorphous catalyst is active for CO 2 photoreduction, the samples were anodizing for 30 min to produce a thinner film.This approach avoids that the light penetrating too deep inside into the am-TNTA film since traps in the bulk of the material can compromise the reduction and oxidation potential of the electrons and holes, inhibiting transport and charge transfer (Baccaro and Gutz, 2018). Therefore, TNTA films were grown over Ti substrate via potentiostatic anodization at 50 V for 30 min in Ethylene glycol media containing 0.75 wt.NH 4 F and 10 vol.Water.The same anodizing conditions (except the anodized area) were used for all the samples used in this study.The current transients were monitored to assure the experiments repeatability and, consequently, the homogeneity of the material properties in the samples with different anodized areas (see SI file for details). Fig. 1A depicts the current density vs. time curve, divided into three typical regions (Ferreira et al., 2019).Region I is characterized by the abrupt drop of the current density in the early stages of the anodization (0-15 s) until reaching a minimum value denoted by point a in the inset of Fig. 1A.This current reduction is promoted by the formation of the compact oxide film, namely barrier oxide, which increases the resistance of the system (Trivinho-Strixino et al., 2017).In region II, nucleation of the nanotubes takes place.Since the formation of open channels in the oxide offers less resistive pathways, the current density rises with the increase of the surface area of the oxide until achieving point b, where the pores achieve their maximum diameter.After this point, the oxide grows in the bottom of the nanotube, that is, into the metal/oxide interface, resulting in the enlargement of the oxide layer and the nanotube length.Simultaneously to the oxide growth reaction, fluoride ions in the electrolytic medium are promoting the dissolution of the oxide via TiF 6 -2 complex formation (Ghicov and Schmuki, 2009).In region III, the oxide formation reaction and dissolution process reach a steady-state resulting in the vertical growth of the nanotubular structure of TiO 2 .The stages of the oxide layer formation over the titanium substrate monitored by the anodization curve (Fig. 1A) are illustrated in Fig. 1B.This schematic illustration shows the steps of titanium anodic oxidation, including the barrier oxide film formation, pores nucleation, and nanotubes growth into the substrate. Fig. 1C shows the nanotubular structure of the am-TNTA surface obtained by SEM.The nanotubes inner diameter presented values in the 80-120 nm range, with an average value of 100 10 nm, wall NT thickness of 26 5 nm, and a void distance between the nanotubes of 12 9 nm.The nanotube length values ranging from 3.4 to 3.9 m were determined from the SEM side view of the sample (Fig. 1D) obtained in different positions.The average thickness of 3.7 0.3 m found is similar to other TNTA films synthesized under similar conditions reported in the literature (Atyaoui et al., 2013;Hao et al., 2019).Table 1 depicts the compositional analysis of the oxide layer obtained by EDX (see the full table in Supporting Information for more details).The semi-quantitative analysis shows Ti and O elements as majority composition, as expected for the TiO 2 layers, with 33.30 At. and 45.25 At., respectively.N, F and C species from the electrolyte composed of NH 4 F and Ethylene glycol were incorporated into the film in minor quantities.The homogenous distribution of the elements along the am-TNTA surface is shown in Fig. S3. The TNTA films produced by the anodization technique under low voltages (10-60 V) are typically amorphous (Simon et al., 2019(Simon et al., , 2021)), although some authors reported traces of the anatase phase in the film synthetized at 40 V in a glycerol-based electrolyte (Macak et al., 2008).Therefore, for a full oxide crystallization, heat treatment in temperatures above 400 C is necessary (Ghicov and Schmuki, 2009;Indira et al., 2015;Santos et al., 2021).In this study, the focus is on evaluating the photocatalytic activity and stability of the amorphous material; then, the TNTA samples were used as anodized.Fig. 2 depicts the diffractograms of the metallic titanium substrate, the am-TNTA sample, and an anodized TNTA sample produced under the exact anodizing conditions, which was annealed at 450 C under air for 2 h at a 7 C min -1 heating rate.After being maintained at 450 C for 2 h in the tube furnace, the sample was cooling down to room temperature naturally. The diffractogram of the metallic Ti exhibits the Bragg peaks of the hexagonal phase according to PDF 00-044-1294 (Sailer and McCarthy, 1993), where the main peak ( 101) is observed at 40.2 .Other characteristic peaks of this metallic phase are (100) at 35.1 , (002) at 38.4 , (102) at 53 , (103) at 70.7 .These peaks are also observed in the pattern of the annealed TNTA, which reveals a mixture of hexagonal Ti and anatase TiO 2 phase, indicating that the X-ray beam reached the substrate during the scan.The main peaks of the anatase phase are indicated in the second diffractogram according to PDF 01-086-1157 (Sanchez et al., 1996), where the most intensity peak ( 101) is observed at 25.3 .Other characteristic peaks of the anatase phase are (004) at 37.9 , (200) at 48 , (105) at 54.0 , and (211) at 55.1 .The diffractogram of the am-TNTA sample was performed using a small scattering angle to minimize the effect of the metallic substrate.Its pattern is characterized by broader low-intensity peaks and a deviation from the baseline at 2 range from 10 to 35 ; a larger deviation at low 2 when compared with the other two diffractograms.The baseline deviation, broader peaks, or absence of peaks are typical for amorphous material since the crystalline materials present a regular and straight baseline, and well-defined and sharp Bragg peaks (Cullity and Stock, 2001).The broader peak around 25 (101), 37 (004), and 48 (200) in the am-TNTA diffractogram may indicate the presence of the anatase phase in a small extension.Different from powders, the crystallographic orientation of the substrate can influence the nucleation of small crystals in films during the oxide growth.However, the quantity is too small to attribute some crystalline character to the material, as reported by other authors (Macak et al., 2008).Therefore, XRD results demonstrate that TNTA without annealing is predominantly amorphous. Fig. 3 depicts the absorption spectrum of the TNTA film, where it can be seen that the semiconductor majority absorbs in the UV spectra range (390 nm).However, a small but significant absorption is also observed in the visible range (400-700 nm).Table 1 showed that am-TNTA film has 9.92 at. of N in its composition incorporated from NH 4 F content in the electrolyte during the anodization.This N content can exert some contribution to the visible light absorption observed for the am-TNTA catalyst.The incorporated nitrogen into am-TNTA, could alter the semiconductor electronic state, creating sub-energetic states (Li et al., 2010) and enhancing its photocatalytic activity under visible light irradiation. The bandgap of 3.10 eV was determined from Tauc plot (Fig. 3 inset), which was calculated using Tauc's equation (h where is the absorption coefficient, h is Planck's constant, is the radiation frequency and is equal to the speed of light in a vacuum (c) divided by the wavelength (), A is the optical constant, E g is the optical band gap, and n was assumed as 0.5 for direct transitions (Nunez et al., 2021).This bandgap value is slightly larger than the 2.84 eV observed for the am-TNTA produced under similar anodizing conditions (Hao et al., 2019), but it is typical for TiO 2 materials (Ge et al., 2016). The XPS technique was employed to analyze the surface chemical state of the synthesized catalyst.Fig. 4A depicts the XPS wide spectrum which shows the presence of Ti, O, C and a small amount of F and N, which are originated from the NH 4 F salt employed in the synthesis of the am-TNTA film.The Ti 2p spectrum (Fig. 4B) shows two peaks positioned at 459.08 eV and 464.82 eV corresponding to Ti 2p 3/2 and Ti 2p 1/2 , respectively, attributed to the chemical state Ti 4 (Mu et al., 2012;Umer et al., 2019).The XPS spectrum of O 1s (Fig. 4C) was deconvoluted into three peaks positioned at 530.30 eV, 531.51 eV, and 533.06 eV.The peak at 530.30 eV corresponds to lattice oxygen (Ti-O bond), while the peaks at 531.51 eV and 533.06 eV correspond to hydroxyl groups or water (Hao et al., 2019).The C 1s high-resolution XPS (Fig. 4D) indicates three peaks related to C-C, C-O, and COOH (Zaleska et al., 2008), originating from the Ethylene glycol used in the preparation of the am-TNTA film. For nanostructure semiconductor electrodes, information about electronic structure can be extracted from the intrinsic semiconductor properties and the transient states of the semiconductor when it interacts with the electrolyte at a given electrode potential (Berger et al., 2012).Therefore, the electrochemical characterization of the am-TNTA was performed in phosphate buffer media by CV and EIS techniques. This approach was used to investigate the electronic properties of the film and the main processes occurring in the oxide surface. Fig. 5 depicts the cyclic voltammograms of the am-TNTA in the -0.9 V to 0.9 V (vs.NHE) potential window obtained at different scan rates in phosphate buffer solution (pH 7) saturated with N 2 and CO 2 from the starting potential of -0.1 V (vs.NHE).Under these conditions, no cathodic peaks were observed during the cathodic scan toward negative potentials.In the reverse scan, an anodic peak was observed around -0.6 V vs. NHE (at 5 mV s -1 ) in the direction of the positive potentials (Fig. 5A).This anodic peak can be attributed to the oxidation of the hydrogen previously adsorbed during water discharge in the cathodic scan or to the detrapping of the electrons that will be discussed in the sequence.This peak shifted to more positive values as the scan rates increased.The current density increased linearly with the scan rate, indicating no diffusional limitations under this condition, which implies that the system is explained by electron transfer kinetics (Bertoluzzi et al., 2013).The voltammograms in Fig. 5B follow the same tendency observed in Fig. 5A, and no significant features were observed in those profiles, except for the increase of the current density at high scan rates for the electrolyte saturated with CO 2 , which may indicate that the CO 2 affect the capacitance of the system. Therefore, for better visualization of these results, the current values were divided by the corresponded scan rate and plotted as a ratio between charge and potential, as shown in Fig. 5C-D.This shape can be interpreted as a relation between the trapping/detrapping process and the electron transfers between the trap and solution (Bertoluzzi et al., 2013).At a first view, when compared these charge/potential profiles (Fig. 5C-D) with CV profiles (Fig. 5A-B), it can be noted that the processes occurring at low scan rate (5 mV s -1 , black line) exhibited the larger variation in the charge/potential ratio, indicating that slow kinetic processes are favored. The plots from Fig. 5C-D depict four regions designated by i, ii, iii, and iv, in which processes can be described as follows: in region i, the traps are being filled as the system advances toward more negative potentials.In region ii, the main process is the electron transfer in the conduction band (CB), as shown by the Mott-Schottky plot in Fig. 6, where the band edge for the electron transfer from/to CB is identified as -0.4 V vs. NHE.From Fig. 5C-D, the fast increase of the charge/potential rate is observed just after this point (-0.4V vs. NHE).In region iii of the anodic scan, the charge transfer processes occurring are originated at the CB.Region iv is characterized by the electron transfer from the trap to the solution as the potential advances toward more positive values. In region iv (Fig. 5C-D), it notes that the electron transfer from the traps is becoming slower due to the adsorption of CO 2 ; in other words, the CO 2 adsorbed becomes a trap, which can stabilize the electron for a longer time in the electrode before it can be transferred.According to Kharade and Chang (2020), this stabilization can occur via hydroxyl groups on the surface of the amorphous TiO 2 that can act as a trap for CO 2 forming carbonate species, increasing CO 2 chemisorption.Therefore, herein the scan rate becomes an important parameter.If the process is slow, more electrons are transferred at lower scan rates.On the other hand, if the process is fast enough, no difference is observed.This factor also may explain why there is no variation of charge in the region i in CO 2 saturated electrolyte (Fig. 5D).Since the CO 2 is adsorbed, the carbonated species formed by chemisorption on the surface act as a trap for electrons, resulting in no variation of the charge in the region i (Fig. 5D). Besides the flat band potential (E fb ), identified as -0.4 V vs. NHE by extrapolation of the linear part of the Mott-Schottky plots (Fig. 6), the charge carriers density (N D ) for the am-TNTA electrode was determined from the Mott-Schottky equation (Hanzu et al., 2011), where the values of 1.2 10 -19 cm -3 and 9.3 10 -19 cm -3 were found for the measurements performed in phosphate buffer solution saturated with N 2 and CO 2 , respectively, assuming a relative permittivity of 55 for TNTA (Raza et al., 2021).These results show that the flat band potential did not change with the CO 2 purge in the electrolyte, but the charge carrier density increased.One hypothesis for the high charge carrier density is the presence of carbonate groups formed on the electrode surface by chemisorption acting like donor group and making the electrons move more freely. The Nyquist plot shows the imaginary part of the complex impedance (-Z ) as a function of the real part (Z ) of the am-TNTA electrode for different frequency values.Fig. S7 (SI file) depicts the impedance spectra for the photocatalyst at -0.2 V, -0.4 V, and -0.6 V vs. NHE.These curves represent the system under three different conditions, i.e., when the applied potential is less negative than the flat band potential (E fb ), equal to E fb , and more negative than E fb .The insets exhibit the highfrequency region, where a semicircle arc is observed in the measurement carried out in electrolyte purge with N 2 at -0.2 V vs. NHE, and its shape is related to the electrolyte resistance (Mei et al., 2018;Freitas et al., 2014).Fig. 7 shows that this semicircle was not observed clearly at more negative potentials or when CO 2 was introduced into the solution. A slight deviation at the low-frequency values was observed with the increase of the solution's resistance in the CO 2 saturated electrolyte.Regarding the different behavior as a function of the applied bias in each case, the change in the semicircle format shows the reduction of the internal resistance (electrode and electrolyte) of the system at more negative potentials. Regarding the N 2 saturation, note in Fig. 7 that the values that close the pseudo-semicircle for each applied potential has the same frequency (398 Hz).This means there is an electron transfer process taking place with that time constant, which charge transfer resistance decreases when the applied potential increase.This happens until it reaches the value of the conduction band, and the transfer from the band takes place.Besides, the frequency of the process (398 Hz 3.98 10 2 s -1 ) is similar to the one reported by Bertoluzzi et al. (5 10 2 s -1 ) (Bertoluzzi and Bisquert, 2012).For the CO 2 saturated electrolyte, the pseudo-semicircle closes at a higher frequency (1000 Hz), which means that it is a faster process overlapping the traps filling, and the electron transfer has a higher resistance. Table 2 shows the capacitance and resistance values obtained fitting the data with a simulated equivalent circuit illustrated in Fig. S7.This circuit was composed of a, b, c circuit parts with resistance and capacitance elements, where R t/d is the trapping/detrapping resistance, C dl is the double-layer capacitance, R t is the resistance of the charge transfer from the trap, C t is the capacitance of the trap, C ct is the capacitance of the charge transfer process from the band, and R ct is the charge transfer resistance from the band. The results from Table 2 showed that the resistance of the trapping/ detrapping (R t/d ) and the capacitance of the double-layer (C dl ) are approximately constant in N 2 saturated electrolyte and presented no significant variation in the CO 2 case, indicating significant changes in the trapping/detrapping mechanism with the applied potential.However, compared with N 2 saturated electrolyte, the resistance (R t/d ) values are higher in CO 2 while C dl values are small.The charge transfer resistance from the traps (R t ) decreases toward more negative potentials as the traps are being filled from the solution with N 2 , but it remained constant in CO 2 solution.The capacitance of the traps (C t ) exhibits a maximum value is at -0.2 V (vs.NHE) in both cases.These values are related to the semicircles from the Nyquist plots.As the overpotential increases (potential become more negative), the resistance of the charge transfer from the traps (R ct ) reduces while the corresponding capacitance (C ct ) increases.This indicates that the accumulation of charge is diminishing toward more negative potentials. These results show that the major effect is the CO 2 on the trap filling resistance.The traps are easily or faster filled when the CO 2 is adsorbed, Fig. 7. Detail of the high-frequency regions of the Nyquist diagrams for am-TNTA film obtained in phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.0) saturated with N 2 (right) and CO 2 (left) at -0.2 V, -0.4 V, and -0.6 V vs. NHE. Capacitance and resistance elements obtained from the simulated equivalent circuit illustrated in Fig. S7 according to the applied bias.which supports the hypothesis that the CO 2 interacts directly with the traps, promoting the charge transfer from these intermediate energy levels. It is important to stress that the electrochemical impedance behavior of TNTA films described in the literature diverges one from another according to the film properties and the experimental conditions used during the measurements.So, there is no expected standardized profile for TNTA in general.Also, it is not usual to perform the analysis in CO 2 saturated electrolyte.This implies that a further systematic study should be performed to a better comprehension of these findings by changing the type of gas purged into the electrolyte, testing other pH solutions, and performing under UV-light light irradiation.Regarding this preliminary set of experiments, these EIS results can be summarized as follows: the processes at the electrode surface are affected by (i) the applied potential (more or less negative than the flat band potential of the material), and by (ii) the type of the adsorbent species since the presence and absence of CO 2 molecules were analyzed.This latter factor is the first evidence about the interaction of CO 2 species with the am-TNTA film. Upon studying the characteristics of the synthesized am-TNTA photocatalyst film, the CO 2 photoreduction experiment in the water vapor at 39 C was conducted under UV light irradiation while the CH 4 production was monitored by GC each 30 min for 4 h.Fig. 8A shows the CO 2 photocatalytic reduction activity of the fresh catalyst.The CH 4 production increased with time at a constant rate of 14.0 0.7 mol g cat -1 h -1 .This is a remarkable result for an amorphous nanostructured thinfilm catalyst produced in a fast one-step synthesis without modification.This enhanced photocatalytic activity can be attributed to the surface defects of the amorphous structure, mainly OH groups acting as electron traps and increasing the electron lifetime, as will be discussed in the sequence. After the first batch of the experiment, the am-TNTA film was removed from the reactor, dried at room temperature, and labeled as 'used-catalyst'.The CO 2 reduction experiment was repeated five times over the used catalyst.The results are depicted in Fig. 8B, which shows the CH 4 production rate in the six consequently runs using the same catalyst.The rate of CH 4 production varied in the range 13.7-14.01mol g cat -1 h -1 .The small and approximately constant error bars demonstrated the high stability of catalyst for CO 2 reduction into methane during six reaction cycles.This stability is similar to those reported for the crystalline TNTA films (Kar et al., 2019) and other TiO 2 -based catalysts like the amorphous TiO 2 NH 2 -MIL-125(Ti) film (Hu et al., 2020) and black titania powders (Yin et al., 2017), which exhibited good reproducibility in consecutive experiments of the CO conversion to CH 4 without no significant reduction of photocatalytic activity during 4-6 reaction cycles. The CH 4 production rate in CO 2 photoreduction reaction with water using different TiO 2 catalysts is shown in Table 3.It is important to stress that a direct comparison is not recommended due to the differences in the light irradiation, photocatalytic experimental conditions, and catalyst form (film and powder); however, these values work as a reference for the CH 4 yield.The average CH 4 production rate of 14.0 mol g cat h -1 obtained in this study for the am-TNTA film can be considered an impressive CH 4 production rate for a pure TiO 2 with no modification, no doping, no other materials added, and no heat treatment.As a reference, it can be seen that the pure anatase TiO 2 powder (commercial Degussa P25) as photocatalyst for CO 2 conversion to methane under UV irradiation exhibited a CH 4 production rate of 4.11 mol g cat -1 h -1 (Lo et al., 2007).Regarding TNTA films, Kar et al. (2019) tunned the type of heat treatment and electrolyte composition to teste anatase, rutile, and anatase/rutile mixtures for CO 2 reduction under solar simulated irradiation obtaining different methane yields.Using their values as a reference, the CH 4 production rate for the am-TNTA under UV irradiation (this work) is more similar to those observed for anatase TNTA under the solar simulated light (Kar et al., 2019).However, the photocatalytic activity of the crystalline TNTA was attributed to the presence of Ti 3 states and oxygen vacancies produced by the annealing treatment used to sensitize the material to visible light.Herein, the photocatalytic activity of the amorphous semiconductor is attributed to the surface defects (OH groups) acting as electron traps for reducing charge recombination.The UV-vis absorption spectrum (Fig. 3) showed that the am-TNTA can absorb partially under visible light irradiation, demonstrating that the material prepared in a one-step synthetic route also has the potential to convert CO 2 to CH 4 under solar simulated light. A possible reaction pathway for CO 2 conversion to CH 4 occurring at the am-TNTA film surface is illustrated in Fig. 9.The position of the conduction band (-0.4 V vs. NHE) was determined by Mott-Schottky analysis, and the position of the valence band (2.7 V vs. NHE) was calculated from the bandgap (3.10 eV) obtained by the Tauc plot (Fig. 3).This indicates that the counter-reaction taking place to compensate the photogenerated holes is most likely the oxidation of water to produce O 2 (Bolts and Wrighton, 1976;Al Jitan et al., 2020).spectra exhibit a similar profile, with slight changes.It is important to stress the Ti substrate naturally oxide in the air forming a thin TiO 2 layer in the nanometer range.Due to this thin TiO 2 layer covering the bare Ti, a similar profile between Ti substrate and am-TNTA was expected, except for the bonds involving N, C, and F adsorbed from the electrolyte during the synthesis.Notably, the three spectra exhibit a wide broadband from 2700 to 3700 cm -1 indicating the presence of hydroxyl groups (Erdem et al., 2001).Amino groups are generally detected in this interval; however, the hydroxyl broadband could hide them.Therefore, the identification of the N-H bond in this region is inconclusive.Nonetheless, the low-intensity bands in 1070 and 1442 cm -1 in the am-TNTA fresh are attributed to N-Ti-O stretching vibration and N-H stretching vibration, respectively (Li et al., 2014), indicating some N atoms incorporated into the TiO 2 structure.These bands are not observed in am-TNTA used, suggesting an N leaching from the film.The bending vibration of the O-H bond is observed in 1654, 1632, and cm -1 for Ti substrate, am-TNTA fresh, and am-TNTA used. The low-intensity bands observed in 2114-2200 cm -1 interval in the am-TNTA used might be associated with carbonate/carboxylate species generated by interaction with the catalyst, as proposed by Neat u et al., 2014).However, these bands are also observed with lower intensity in Ti substrate, which might indicate carbonyl groups absorbed from the air over the metallic substrate.Bands at 873 and 888 cm -1 observed in Ti substrate and am-TNTA used are assigned to Ti-O stretching bands.In the FTIR spectra of the am-TNTA fresh, this band is overlapped by another broadband in 700-900 cm -1 interval with a maximum at cm -1 that can be attributed to carbon skeleton vibrations of the ethylene glycol (Leon et al., 2017) incorporated from the electrolyte into TNTA surface that could leach the film after use. The am-TNTA stability before and after recycling was evaluated by FTIR, XPS, and PL techniques.The spectra for the fresh and used catalyst are shown in Fig. S8.As discussed in Section 3.1, the Ti 2p spectrum of the fresh catalyst corresponds to the chemical state Ti 4 .The relative intensity and position of the peaks remained unchanged in the used catalyst XPS spectrum (Fig. S8-B).The XPS spectrum of O 1s (Fig. S8 C-D) revealed the presence of hydroxyl groups or water (Hao et al., 2019).The relative intensity of these peaks is almost constant in the used catalyst.The C 1s spectra (Fig. S8 E-F) indicates peaks related to C-C, C-O, and COOH (Zaleska et al., 2008), originating from the Ethylene glycol used in the preparation of the am-TNTA film.Notably, no heat treatment was done on the synthesized catalyst.However, the relative intensity of the C 1s spectrum remains almost constant in the used catalyst compared to the fresh catalyst, which is in agreement with the photocatalytic reduction results confirming that the produced methane is not originated from this carbon source but CO 2 .The XPS wide spectrum (Fig. S8 G-H) also shows the presence of a small amount of F and N, which are originated from the NH 4 F salt employed in the synthesis of the am-TNTA film. The PL spectra of fresh and used catalysts until the fourth cycle are illustrated in Fig. 11.The emission spectra were collected with excitation at 325 nm wavelength and revealed that the am-TNTA does not present a broadband emission, but several peaks in the whole range of wavelength, indicating multiphononic processes.This behavior, observed for the fresh and used catalyst, was reported in other studies from the literature (Bavykin et al., 2005;Vijayan et al., 2012).In the PL properties of colloidal TiO 2 nanotubes produced by the alkali hydrothermal method (Bavykin et al., 2005), many sharp peaks were observed in the 300-700 nm range.The authors attributed the sharp bands to the low energy states as residual cations incorporated in the material during the synthesis.A similar feature was reported for TiO 2 nanotubes and carbon nanotubes composites (Vijayan et al., 2012).Usually, these sharp bands in PL spectra of semiconductors are attributed to transitions involving impurities states, doping, and the existence of trap states in bandgap promoted by defects.In other PL spectra of TNTA films, broadbands emission was observed and deconvoluted into many emission peaks in the whole range of emission wavelength (Siuzdak et al. 2015a(Siuzdak et al. , 2015b)).The authors suggested that the presence of several peaks in the PL spectrum of TiO 2 nanotubes could have resulted from the existence of sub-bandgap states in the complex structure of nanotubes (Siuzdak et al., 2015b). This behavior implies that several paths for the emission due to the high density of electronic states caused by defects (Mendez-Galvan et al., 2021).These peaks confirm the presence of many deep and shallow surface states, which could enhance the separation of electron/hole pairs and decrease the recombination rate of photoexcited charge carriers (Wang et al., 2018).These defects can be promoted by different oxygen defects like mono-ionized oxygen vacancies (shallow defects) and double-ionized oxygen vacancies (deep defects) formed as a consequence of doping/modification or heat treatment, or they can be caused by hydroxyl/water groups which can trap the electrons and act as shallow acceptor levels (Kharade and Chang, 2020;Mendez-Galvan et al., 2021).For the am-TNTA film, FTIR, XPS, and EIS results evidence that these defects are probably caused by the hydroxyl groups acting as a trap for the CO 2 via formation of carbonate species.On the other hand, the results showed a small absorption of the am-TNTA in the visible light region (Fig. 3) that can be attributed to N incorporated into the film during the synthesis, as suggested by other authors (Li et al., 2010), which can act as impurities in the synthesized material, creating sub-bandgap states. Regarding the intensity of the emission peak, some factors might be contributed to a low emission peak of the am-TNTA film.Since the film was grown on a titanium conductive substrate, the separation of charge carriers due to the transfer of electrons to the conductive substrate could suppress the intensity of PL emission.Another factor is the amorphous character of the am-TNTA.Crystalline semiconductors are expected to exhibit high intensity PL due to their low recombination radioactive when compared with the amorphous. Furthermore, the PL spectra of the used catalyst slightly declined when compared to the fresh catalyst.This minor decrease could result from the adsorption of either reactants or products on the catalyst.Stevanovic et al. (2012) studied the effect of several adsorbed molecules on the PL spectrum of TiO 2 .They found that adsorption of either electron donor or electron acceptor species decreases the PL intensity of the TiO 2 catalyst.The reduction in the PL intensity was related to the band bending and formation of the depletion layer.However, the reduction in the PL intensity in Fig. 11 is insignificant, which agrees with the catalyst stability for methane formation in the repeated experiments. In correspondence to the PL analysis, the C 1s spectrum of XPS (Fig. S8 E-F) does not indicate any noticeable change in the amount of carbon on the catalyst surface.Also, the presence of the irreversible adsorbed oxygenated intermediates or products on the surface of the film should change the O 1s XPS high-resolution spectrum, which has remained almost unchanged in the used catalyst compared to the fresh catalyst.Therefore, the prepared am-TNTA film is highly stable for CO 2 photocatalytic reduction. It is important to discuss some aspects about the findings correlating all data.The results show that photocatalytic activity of the am-TNTA film in the CO 2 reduction to CH 4 can be explained in terms of defects caused by the surface hydroxyl species.Traps are electronic energy levels located in the bandgap of a semiconductor and are involved in the charge-transfer process (Wang et al., 2001).It includes surface states, oxygen vacancies, adsorbed species.Shallow defects are energetically closed to CB or VB, whereas deep defects are energetically closed to the Fermi level (Mendez-Galvan et al., 2021).A nanostructured morphology like the TNTA presents a large number of electron traps at the surface and the grain boundaries, influencing the interfacial kinetics of the transfer processes.The detrapping is possible for these shallow traps, but the deep (bulk) traps can immobilize carriers irreversibly (Wehrenfennig et al., 2015), compromising the charge transfer processes.This is the main reason for the short anodizing time chosen in the synthesis in this study.A longer anodizing time would produce a longer nanotube length, where the light could penetrate deeply, reaching the bulk traps and, consequently, reducing the efficiency of the photocatalytic process. Among these defects, Ti 3 surface states, mono-ionized oxygen vacancies (shallow traps), and doubled-ionized oxygen vacancies (deep traps) were not evidenced in this study.On the other hand, the presence of surface hydroxyl groups was evidenced by FTIR and XPS analysis of am-TNTA film.Hydroxyl groups are considered dominant sites for trapping electrons acting as shallow acceptor levels (Mendez-Galvan et al., 2021).PL spectra (Fig. 11) showed many states attributed to shallow defects that can be promoted by these hydroxyl/water groups.In the case of CO 2 photoreduction, the hydroxyl groups act like traps via formation of the carbonate species (Kharade and Chang, 2020), as suggested by the analysis of the electrochemical data.Therefore, since CO 2 interacts directly with the traps, forming carbonate species, we can assume that, in the am-TNTA film, the charge is transferred directly from these shallow levels.To evaluate the effect of the deep defects of am-TNTA film on the photocatalytic activity in CO 2 reduction, further studies are necessary by fabricating the am-TNTA with different thicknesses, nanotube diameter, and nanotube walls.This study will also be important to verify if the charge carriers from different trap states are homogeneously distributed along the nanotube length and diameter.The effect of these defects on the selectivity towards specific products also should be addressed. The main consequence of these traps is the increase of the electron lifetime, favoring the photocatalytic activity of the am-TNTA and preventing them from charge recombination.The recombination of charge carriers (electron/hole pairs) is a major challenge in developing an efficient photocatalyst.The lifetime of photoexcited electrons and holes is estimated to be in the order of 10 -9 s, while the CO 2 reduction reaction requires a longer time (Fan et al., 2013).Therefore, any change which could decrease the recombination rate of electrons and holes will significantly improve the photocatalytic reduction efficiency.Moreover, metals generally have lower Fermi energies than semiconductors which implies that electrons transfer from the semiconductor to the metal.This flow of electrons will lead to the formation of the Schottky barrier at the interface of the conductor/semiconductor that functions as an effective electron trap.Consequently, the formation of the Schottky barrier will increase the lifetime of the excited electrons, which is essential for developing an efficient photocatalyst (Khan et al., 2015).However, it is important to stress that the charge transfer processes in the amorphous material are not faster as the crystalline TiO 2 .Therefore, this is a factor that also should be addressed in the development of the catalyst."}], "reactor type": [], "operation mode": []}}
