The size and morphology of the TiO Figure 4(a) shows the nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms of the prepared TiO 2 and Cu 2 O/TiO 2 nanojunction.The adsorption isotherms of both TiO 2 and the Cu 2 O/TiO 2 nanojunction can be classified as type IV with a hysteresis loop of type H1, which is associated with porous materials 34.The Meanwhile, as shown in table 1, the total pore volumes and BET surface areas were recorded to be (0.21 cm 3 g -1 , 198.2 m 2 g -1 ) and (0.29 cm 3 g -1 , 206.3 m 2 g -1 ) for TiO 2 and the Cu 2 O/TiO 2 nanojunction, respectively.Both the large total pore volume and surface area strongly support the fact that our developed Cu 2 O/TiO 2 nanojunction has the porous structure, which is beneficial for the CO 2 adsorption in the photocatalytic reaction.In addition, to investigate the CO 2 adsorption ability on the porous TiO 2 and Cu 2 O/TiO 2 nanojunction, CO 2 pulse chemisorption tests were carried out.As shown in figure S1 and table S1 (available at stacks.iop.org/Nano/25/165402/mmedia), the amounts of adsorbed molecular CO 2 were calculated to be 0.12 and 0.27 ml g -1 for our developed porous TiO 2 and Cu 2 O/TiO 2 nanojunction, respectively.The better CO 2 adsorption ability of the Cu 2 O/TiO 2 nanojunction is attributed to its much sharper pore size distribution in the micropore region and its larger total pore volume (0.29 cm 3 g -1 ) than TiO 2 (0.21 cm 3 g -1 ).In comparison, the Pt-loaded porous TiO 2 and the commercial P25 TiO 2 powder were also tested.Pt-TiO 2 shows similar BET surface area and CO 2 adsorption ability to TiO 2 , while the P25 TiO 2 powder with a lower surface area (51.1 m 2 g -1 ) and smaller total pore volume (0.10 cm 3 g -1 ) exhibits a relatively limited CO 2 adsorption, about 0.05 ml g -1 .These results further experimentally confirm that the porous structure with a larger total pore volume is beneficial for the CO 2 adsorption, especially in the case of smaller pore size.In the CO 2 photoreduction test, the porous structure can entrap the CO 2 in the pores and enhance the CO 2 adsorption over the surface of nanoparticles, thus offering more opportunities for the electrons transferred from the surface to CO 2 to reduce it into CH 4 or other hydrocarbons, leading to a higher photocatalytic activity. The UV-visible absorption spectra of the prepared TiO 2 and Cu 2 O/TiO 2 heterojunction are shown in figure 5.It can be clearly seen that the absorption edge of TiO 2 is around 380 nm; as for the Cu 2 O/TiO 2 heterojunction, apart from the absorption edge (nearly 388 nm) of pure TiO 2 , another absorption band edge around 510 nm can also be detected, which results from the existence of Cu 2 O in the hybrid Cu 2 O/TiO 2 material. To experimentally investigate whether the band structures of Cu 2 O and TiO 2 match well with each other in the Cu 2 O/TiO 2 composite, valence-band XPS spectra in addition to the UV-visible absorption spectra were adopted to study the electronic band structures of Cu 2 O and TiO 2 (figure 6).The Cu 2 O was prepared via the same synthetic method as the Cu 2 O/TiO 2 nanojunction, and the detailed characterizations are shown in the supporting information (available at stacks.iop.org/Nano/25/165402/mmedia).As shown in the insets of figures 6(a) and (b), the UV-visible absorption spectra demonstrate that the absorption edges of TiO 2 and Cu 2 O are nearly 371 and 644 nm, respectively.TiO 2 is known as an indirect semiconductor, while Cu 2 O is a direct semiconductor.As a semiconductor, the band gaps can be calculated by the equation of h A(h -E g ) n/2 , in which is the absorption coefficient, h is the incident photon energy, A is the proportionality constant, E g is the band gap, and n is equal to 1 and 4 for direct and indirect semiconductors, respectively 12,35.According to this Butler equation, plotting (h) 1/2 or (h) 2 versus h from the absorption spectra, and extrapolating the linear part to zero on an abscissa axis, from the intersections of the straight lines obtained we can deduce the bandgaps of 3. The CO 2 photoreduction tests of the as-prepared TiO 2 and Cu 2 O/TiO 2 nanojunction material were evaluated under UVvisible light irradiation (figure 7(a)).For purposes of compari-son, the Pt-loaded porous TiO 2 (Pt-TiO 2 ) and commercial P25 were also tested under the same experimental conditions.As shown in figure 7(b), the CH 4 evolution rates were calculated to be 2.4, 28.4,3.2, and 3.7 ppm g -1 h -1 for the TiO 2 , Cu 2 O/TiO 2 nanojunction, Pt-TiO 2 , and P25, respectively.Among these samples, the Cu 2 O/TiO 2 nanojunction exhibits the highest photocatalytic activity, about 12, 9, and 7.5 times higher than The well designed porous structure combined with the closely contacted interface of the Cu 2 O/TiO 2 nanojunction plays important roles in enhancing the photocatalytic activity.First, in contrast to pure TiO 2 , the superior activity of the Cu 2 O/TiO 2 material can be attributed to its well designed nanojunction structure.As shown in scheme 3(a), once excited, the electrons will transfer from Cu 2 O to, and accumulate on, the TiO 2 , while the holes will move from TiO 2 to Cu 2 O, to realize the charge separation, while for pure TiO 2 (scheme 3(b)), the electrons and holes easily recombine on the surface, leading to a poor charge separation efficiency and lower photocatalytic activity. Then, after Pt loading, the photocatalytic activity of Pt-TiO 2 is slightly enhanced compared with pure TiO 2 , but still lower than that of the Cu 2 O/TiO 2 nanojunction.As shown in scheme 3(c), Pt has a lower Fermi energy than TiO 2 , so Pt-TiO 2 can enhance the charge separation efficiency by pushing the photogenerated electrons transfer from the conduction band of TiO 2 to the surface Pt sites; then, the accumulated electrons on the Pt sites reduce CO 2 to CH 4 .However, most of the molecular CO 2 is adsorbed on the porous TiO 2 , and to finish the whole CO 2 photoreduction process the molecular CO 2 on the TiO 2 surface needs to migrate dozens of nanometers to the Pt sites; during this migration, the charges (electrons and holes) are easily recombined.In the case of our developed Cu 2 O/TiO 2 nanojunction, as shown in scheme 3(a), the CO 2 adsorption and electron accumulation occur simultaneously on the TiO 2 surface, thus the distance for electron migration becomes shorter and the ratio for recombination on the surface becomes lower, leading to higher activity. Furthermore, compared with commercial P25 TiO 2 powder, which is composed of 80 anatase and 20 rutile (scheme 3(d)), our developed Cu 2 O/TiO 2 nanojunction exhibits 7.5 times higher activity in the CH 4 evolution (figure 7).The higher activity of the Cu 2 O/TiO 2 nanojunction in contrast to P25 might be ascribed to the porous structure and larger surface area, as shown in table 1, which facilitate the CO 2 adsorption (0.27 ml g -1 for Cu 2 O/TiO 2 nanojunction versus 0.05 ml g -1 for P25) and can offer more reaction active sites.On the other hand, our designed Cu 2 O/TiO 2 nanojunction has a smaller particle size (about 5-8 nanometer) than that of P25 TiO 2 (around 25 nm).With a smaller particle size, the migration distance for the electrons and holes from the bulk to surface can be greatly reduced, which can somewhat inhibit the charge recombination in the bulk.

The CO 2 photoreduction tests of the as-prepared TiO 2 and Cu 2 O/TiO 2 nanojunction material were evaluated under UVvisible light irradiation (figure 7(a)).For purposes of compari-son, the Pt-loaded porous TiO 2 (Pt-TiO 2 ) and commercial P25 were also tested under the same experimental conditions.As shown in figure 7(b), the CH 4 evolution rates were calculated to be 2.4, 28.4,3.2, and 3.7 ppm g -1 h -1 for the TiO 2 , Cu 2 O/TiO 2 nanojunction, Pt-TiO 2 , and P25, respectively.Among these samples, the Cu 2 O/TiO 2 nanojunction exhibits the highest photocatalytic activity, about 12, 9, and 7.5 times higher than The well designed porous structure combined with the closely contacted interface of the Cu 2 O/TiO 2 nanojunction plays important roles in enhancing the photocatalytic activity.First, in contrast to pure TiO 2 , the superior activity of the Cu 2 O/TiO 2 material can be attributed to its well designed nanojunction structure.As shown in scheme 3(a), once excited, the electrons will transfer from Cu 2 O to, and accumulate on, the TiO 2 , while the holes will move from TiO 2 to Cu 2 O, to realize the charge separation, while for pure TiO 2 (scheme 3(b)), the electrons and holes easily recombine on the surface, leading to a poor charge separation efficiency and lower photocatalytic activity. Then, after Pt loading, the photocatalytic activity of Pt-TiO 2 is slightly enhanced compared with pure TiO 2 , but still lower than that of the Cu 2 O/TiO 2 nanojunction.As shown in scheme 3(c), Pt has a lower Fermi energy than TiO 2 , so Pt-TiO 2 can enhance the charge separation efficiency by pushing the photogenerated electrons transfer from the conduction band of TiO 2 to the surface Pt sites; then, the accumulated electrons on the Pt sites reduce CO 2 to CH 4 .However, most of the molecular CO 2 is adsorbed on the porous TiO 2 , and to finish the whole CO 2 photoreduction process the molecular CO 2 on the TiO 2 surface needs to migrate dozens of nanometers to the Pt sites; during this migration, the charges (electrons and holes) are easily recombined.In the case of our developed Cu 2 O/TiO 2 nanojunction, as shown in scheme 3(a), the CO 2 adsorption and electron accumulation occur simultaneously on the TiO 2 surface, thus the distance for electron migration becomes shorter and the ratio for recombination on the surface becomes lower, leading to higher activity. Furthermore, compared with commercial P25 TiO 2 powder, which is composed of 80 anatase and 20 rutile (scheme 3(d)), our developed Cu 2 O/TiO 2 nanojunction exhibits 7.5 times higher activity in the CH 4 evolution (figure 7).The higher activity of the Cu 2 O/TiO 2 nanojunction in contrast to P25 might be ascribed to the porous structure and larger surface area, as shown in table 1, which facilitate the CO 2 adsorption (0.27 ml g -1 for Cu 2 O/TiO 2 nanojunction versus 0.05 ml g -1 for P25) and can offer more reaction active sites.On the other hand, our designed Cu 2 O/TiO 2 nanojunction has a smaller particle size (about 5-8 nanometer) than that of P25 TiO 2 (around 25 nm).With a smaller particle size, the migration distance for the electrons and holes from the bulk to surface can be greatly reduced, which can somewhat inhibit the charge recombination in the bulk.

The size and morphology of the TiO Figure 4(a) shows the nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms of the prepared TiO 2 and Cu 2 O/TiO 2 nanojunction.The adsorption isotherms of both TiO 2 and the Cu 2 O/TiO 2 nanojunction can be classified as type IV with a hysteresis loop of type H1, which is associated with porous materials 34.The Meanwhile, as shown in table 1, the total pore volumes and BET surface areas were recorded to be (0.21 cm 3 g -1 , 198.2 m 2 g -1 ) and (0.29 cm 3 g -1 , 206.3 m 2 g -1 ) for TiO 2 and the Cu 2 O/TiO 2 nanojunction, respectively.Both the large total pore volume and surface area strongly support the fact that our developed Cu 2 O/TiO 2 nanojunction has the porous structure, which is beneficial for the CO 2 adsorption in the photocatalytic reaction.In addition, to investigate the CO 2 adsorption ability on the porous TiO 2 and Cu 2 O/TiO 2 nanojunction, CO 2 pulse chemisorption tests were carried out.As shown in figure S1 and table S1 (available at stacks.iop.org/Nano/25/165402/mmedia), the amounts of adsorbed molecular CO 2 were calculated to be 0.12 and 0.27 ml g -1 for our developed porous TiO 2 and Cu 2 O/TiO 2 nanojunction, respectively.The better CO 2 adsorption ability of the Cu 2 O/TiO 2 nanojunction is attributed to its much sharper pore size distribution in the micropore region and its larger total pore volume (0.29 cm 3 g -1 ) than TiO 2 (0.21 cm 3 g -1 ).In comparison, the Pt-loaded porous TiO 2 and the commercial P25 TiO 2 powder were also tested.Pt-TiO 2 shows similar BET surface area and CO 2 adsorption ability to TiO 2 , while the P25 TiO 2 powder with a lower surface area (51.1 m 2 g -1 ) and smaller total pore volume (0.10 cm 3 g -1 ) exhibits a relatively limited CO 2 adsorption, about 0.05 ml g -1 .These results further experimentally confirm that the porous structure with a larger total pore volume is beneficial for the CO 2 adsorption, especially in the case of smaller pore size.In the CO 2 photoreduction test, the porous structure can entrap the CO 2 in the pores and enhance the CO 2 adsorption over the surface of nanoparticles, thus offering more opportunities for the electrons transferred from the surface to CO 2 to reduce it into CH 4 or other hydrocarbons, leading to a higher photocatalytic activity.

The size and morphology of the TiO Figure 4(a) shows the nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms of the prepared TiO 2 and Cu 2 O/TiO 2 nanojunction.The adsorption isotherms of both TiO 2 and the Cu 2 O/TiO 2 nanojunction can be classified as type IV with a hysteresis loop of type H1, which is associated with porous materials 34.The Meanwhile, as shown in table 1, the total pore volumes and BET surface areas were recorded to be (0.21 cm 3 g -1 , 198.2 m 2 g -1 ) and (0.29 cm 3 g -1 , 206.3 m 2 g -1 ) for TiO 2 and the Cu 2 O/TiO 2 nanojunction, respectively.Both the large total pore volume and surface area strongly support the fact that our developed Cu 2 O/TiO 2 nanojunction has the porous structure, which is beneficial for the CO 2 adsorption in the photocatalytic reaction.In addition, to investigate the CO 2 adsorption ability on the porous TiO 2 and Cu 2 O/TiO 2 nanojunction, CO 2 pulse chemisorption tests were carried out.As shown in figure S1 and table S1 (available at stacks.iop.org/Nano/25/165402/mmedia), the amounts of adsorbed molecular CO 2 were calculated to be 0.12 and 0.27 ml g -1 for our developed porous TiO 2 and Cu 2 O/TiO 2 nanojunction, respectively.The better CO 2 adsorption ability of the Cu 2 O/TiO 2 nanojunction is attributed to its much sharper pore size distribution in the micropore region and its larger total pore volume (0.29 cm 3 g -1 ) than TiO 2 (0.21 cm 3 g -1 ).In comparison, the Pt-loaded porous TiO 2 and the commercial P25 TiO 2 powder were also tested.Pt-TiO 2 shows similar BET surface area and CO 2 adsorption ability to TiO 2 , while the P25 TiO 2 powder with a lower surface area (51.1 m 2 g -1 ) and smaller total pore volume (0.10 cm 3 g -1 ) exhibits a relatively limited CO 2 adsorption, about 0.05 ml g -1 .These results further experimentally confirm that the porous structure with a larger total pore volume is beneficial for the CO 2 adsorption, especially in the case of smaller pore size.In the CO 2 photoreduction test, the porous structure can entrap the CO 2 in the pores and enhance the CO 2 adsorption over the surface of nanoparticles, thus offering more opportunities for the electrons transferred from the surface to CO 2 to reduce it into CH 4 or other hydrocarbons, leading to a higher photocatalytic activity. The UV-visible absorption spectra of the prepared TiO 2 and Cu 2 O/TiO 2 heterojunction are shown in figure 5.It can be clearly seen that the absorption edge of TiO 2 is around 380 nm; as for the Cu 2 O/TiO 2 heterojunction, apart from the absorption edge (nearly 388 nm) of pure TiO 2 , another absorption band edge around 510 nm can also be detected, which results from the existence of Cu 2 O in the hybrid Cu 2 O/TiO 2 material. To experimentally investigate whether the band structures of Cu 2 O and TiO 2 match well with each other in the Cu 2 O/TiO 2 composite, valence-band XPS spectra in addition to the UV-visible absorption spectra were adopted to study the electronic band structures of Cu 2 O and TiO 2 (figure 6).The Cu 2 O was prepared via the same synthetic method as the Cu 2 O/TiO 2 nanojunction, and the detailed characterizations are shown in the supporting information (available at stacks.iop.org/Nano/25/165402/mmedia).As shown in the insets of figures 6(a) and (b), the UV-visible absorption spectra demonstrate that the absorption edges of TiO 2 and Cu 2 O are nearly 371 and 644 nm, respectively.TiO 2 is known as an indirect semiconductor, while Cu 2 O is a direct semiconductor.As a semiconductor, the band gaps can be calculated by the equation of h A(h -E g ) n/2 , in which is the absorption coefficient, h is the incident photon energy, A is the proportionality constant, E g is the band gap, and n is equal to 1 and 4 for direct and indirect semiconductors, respectively 12,35.According to this Butler equation, plotting (h) 1/2 or (h) 2 versus h from the absorption spectra, and extrapolating the linear part to zero on an abscissa axis, from the intersections of the straight lines obtained we can deduce the bandgaps of 3. The CO 2 photoreduction tests of the as-prepared TiO 2 and Cu 2 O/TiO 2 nanojunction material were evaluated under UVvisible light irradiation (figure 7(a)).For purposes of compari-son, the Pt-loaded porous TiO 2 (Pt-TiO 2 ) and commercial P25 were also tested under the same experimental conditions.As shown in figure 7(b), the CH 4 evolution rates were calculated to be 2.4, 28.4,3.2, and 3.7 ppm g -1 h -1 for the TiO 2 , Cu 2 O/TiO 2 nanojunction, Pt-TiO 2 , and P25, respectively.Among these samples, the Cu 2 O/TiO 2 nanojunction exhibits the highest photocatalytic activity, about 12, 9, and 7.5 times higher than The well designed porous structure combined with the closely contacted interface of the Cu 2 O/TiO 2 nanojunction plays important roles in enhancing the photocatalytic activity.First, in contrast to pure TiO 2 , the superior activity of the Cu 2 O/TiO 2 material can be attributed to its well designed nanojunction structure.As shown in scheme 3(a), once excited, the electrons will transfer from Cu 2 O to, and accumulate on, the TiO 2 , while the holes will move from TiO 2 to Cu 2 O, to realize the charge separation, while for pure TiO 2 (scheme 3(b)), the electrons and holes easily recombine on the surface, leading to a poor charge separation efficiency and lower photocatalytic activity. Then, after Pt loading, the photocatalytic activity of Pt-TiO 2 is slightly enhanced compared with pure TiO 2 , but still lower than that of the Cu 2 O/TiO 2 nanojunction.As shown in scheme 3(c), Pt has a lower Fermi energy than TiO 2 , so Pt-TiO 2 can enhance the charge separation efficiency by pushing the photogenerated electrons transfer from the conduction band of TiO 2 to the surface Pt sites; then, the accumulated electrons on the Pt sites reduce CO 2 to CH 4 .However, most of the molecular CO 2 is adsorbed on the porous TiO 2 , and to finish the whole CO 2 photoreduction process the molecular CO 2 on the TiO 2 surface needs to migrate dozens of nanometers to the Pt sites; during this migration, the charges (electrons and holes) are easily recombined.In the case of our developed Cu 2 O/TiO 2 nanojunction, as shown in scheme 3(a), the CO 2 adsorption and electron accumulation occur simultaneously on the TiO 2 surface, thus the distance for electron migration becomes shorter and the ratio for recombination on the surface becomes lower, leading to higher activity. Furthermore, compared with commercial P25 TiO 2 powder, which is composed of 80 anatase and 20 rutile (scheme 3(d)), our developed Cu 2 O/TiO 2 nanojunction exhibits 7.5 times higher activity in the CH 4 evolution (figure 7).The higher activity of the Cu 2 O/TiO 2 nanojunction in contrast to P25 might be ascribed to the porous structure and larger surface area, as shown in table 1, which facilitate the CO 2 adsorption (0.27 ml g -1 for Cu 2 O/TiO 2 nanojunction versus 0.05 ml g -1 for P25) and can offer more reaction active sites.On the other hand, our designed Cu 2 O/TiO 2 nanojunction has a smaller particle size (about 5-8 nanometer) than that of P25 TiO 2 (around 25 nm).With a smaller particle size, the migration distance for the electrons and holes from the bulk to surface can be greatly reduced, which can somewhat inhibit the charge recombination in the bulk.

Cu 2 O/TiO 2 composite material, the content of Cu 2 O in the composites might affect their photocatalytic properties.Accordingly, Cu 2 O/TiO 2 composites in different mass ratios (such as 1:1, 1:3, and 1:7) were prepared to investigate their photocatalytic properties.As shown in figure S4(a) (available at stacks.iop.org/Nano/25/165402/mmedia), with more Cu 2 O contained in the composite material, the intensity of the relative peak around 36.22 (the diffraction of the (111) plane of Cu 2 O) increased; in parallel, the light absorption edge of the composites was also red-shifted to the longer wavelength region (figure S4(b) available at stacks.iop.org/Nano/25/165402/mmedia).When testing the photocatalytic activities in CO 2 photoreduction, the CH 4 evolution rates were calculated to be 2.4, 4.0, 28.4,9.4, 8.5, and 5.9 ppm g -1 h -1 for TiO 2 , CT 1:7 , CT 1:5 , CT 1:3 , CT 1:1 , and Cu 2 O, respectively (figures S4(c)-(d) available at stacks.iop.org/Nano/25/165402/mmedia).Obviously, all the Cu 2 O/TiO 2 composites exhibit better photocatalytic activity than TiO 2 , Pt-TiO 2 , or P25.With the optimized concentration, the Cu 2 O/TiO 2 nanojunction with the mass ratio of 1:5 exhibits the highest CH 4 evolution rates. , 37.83 , 47.90 , 53.91 , and 54.99 can be assigned to (101), (004), (200), (105), and (211) planes of anatase TiO 2 (JCPDS no 71-1167) (figure 1(a)), respectively.Thus, as shown in figure 1(b), our prepared TiO 2 is well indexed to the pure anatase TiO 2 .For the Cu 2 O/TiO 2 heterojunction (figure 1(c)), besides the peaks matching well with the anatase TiO 2 , the relative peak around at 36.22 is indexed to the diffraction of the (111) plane of the cubic Cu 2 O (JCPDS no 78-2076) (figure 1(d)), indicating that TiO 2 and Cu 2 O coexist in the Cu 2 O/TiO 2 heterojunction.Meanwhile, the Cu 2p XPS spectrum was also recorded to demonstrate the valence state of Cu in the Cu 2 O/TiO 2 composite.As shown in figure S1 (available at stacks.iop.org/Nano/25/165402/mmedia), the XPS spectrum revealed the Cu 2p 3/2 and Cu 2p 1/2 peaks located at 932.3 and 952.2 eV, respectively, Total pore volumes, BET surface areas, as well as the amounts of adsorbed CO 2 of the prepared TiO 2 , Cu 2 O/TiO 2 nanojunction, Pt-TiO 2 , and commercial P25 TiO 2 powder. 2, some of the pores in TiO 2 might be partially filled, leading to a smaller pore size.
