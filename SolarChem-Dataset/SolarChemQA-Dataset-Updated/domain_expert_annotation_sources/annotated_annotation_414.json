Figure 2 shows the TEM images of the as-formed TiO 2 -RGO nanocomposites.As seen from Figure 2, many nanoparticles adhered to the graphene sheets with little agglomeration, which confirms the successful immobilizing TiO 2 nanoparticles on the graphene sheet.The reason for the effective assembly is that TiO 2 nanoparticles can interact with functional groups such as epoxides, hydroxyl, and carboxylic acids on the GO sheets. XRD characterization was conducted to determine the crystal structural about GO and TiO 2 -RGO, and the results are shown in Figure 3.The pure GO showed a sharp peak at 2 11.68 , corresponding to the GO (001) plane with an interlayer spacing of 0.83 nm.It can be found that the interlayer spacing of GO is larger than that of the natural graphite powder because of the introduction of oxygen-containing functional groups onto the surface of carbon sheet.As for TiO 2 -RGO, the feature peak of the GO has disappeared and a very broad peak at 2 22.50 , corresponding to graphene (002) plane with an interlayer spacing of 0.40 nm, was observed, which confirms the reduction of GO to graphene in the hydrothermal environment.However, there was a small amount of residual oxygen-containing functional groups in the as-formed TiO 2 -RGO nanocomposites due to the incomplete reduction of GO sheet to graphene 18.The same phenomenon was observed in previous studies 19 Raman spectroscopy was utilized to examine the information about structural changes during the fabrication process.As shown in Figure 4(a), the Raman spectra of RGO exhibited a D-band peak at 1362.6 cm -1 and a G-band peak at 1574.7 cm -1 .In contrast, the G-band shifts by 6.2 cm -1 to a high frequency at 1580.9 cm -1 for TiO 2 -RGO nanocomposites (Figure 4(b)), which suggests the occurrence of charge transfer between the GO sheet and TiO 2 nanoparticles.It is well known that the intensity ratio of D-band to G-band ( D / G ) is characteristic of the extent of disorder present within the material 20.In our case, D / G was 0.96 for TiO 2 -RGO, and it increased compared to that of the RGO ( D / G 0.91), exhibiting a greater sp 2 character.Besides, the ratio of the intensities for TiO 2 -RGO is slight increased, which confirms the presence of donor molecules on graphene. To further investigate the specific surface area of TiO 2 -RGO, the N 2 adsorption-desorption measurements were carried out at 77 K. Figure 5 shows that the nitrogen adsorption isotherm is a typical IV type curve.Additionally, the loop observed is ascribed as type H3 loops confirming the presence of a mesoporous structure.The specific BET surface area of the as-prepared TiO 2 -RGO was measured to be 80.18 m 2 g -1 . Ultraviolet Light Irradiation.To evaluate the photocatalytic activity of TiO 2 -RGO samples, the photocatalytic CO 2 conversion in the presence of KOH solution was investigated.Figure 6 shows that CO 2 can be photoreduced to CH 3 OH by using pure TiO 2 sample (Cat-1).With the addition of graphene amount of photocatalysts, CO 2 can be photoreduced to CH 3 OH and CH 4 .It is obvious that Cat-3 (2.20 mol g -1 h -1 CH 3 OH and 2.10 mol g -1 h -1 CH 4 ) exhibits much higher activity than Cat-2 (2.0 mol g -1 h -1 CH 3 OH and 1.34 mol g -1 h -1 CH 4 ).The CH 3 OH yield with TiO 2 was 1.83 mol g -1 h -1 .The results demonstrated that the photocatalytic efficiency increased with the increases of graphene amount.With the graphene amount increased from 0 to 50, the yields of CH 4 and CH 3 OH increased simultaneously.It is attributed to the increasing separation efficiency of the photogenerated electrons, because the existence of graphene could offer more active adsorption sites and photocatalytic reaction centers 21.Furthermore, the yield efficiency increased with the increase of dispersion degree."}], "reactor type": [], "operation mode": [{"llm generation": "Continuous", "source": "The photocatalytic activity of the prepared TiO 2 -RGO nanocomposites was studied in a double-wall cylindrical quartz reactor at ambient condition with continuous gas flow.", "context": "2.1.Synthesis of TiO 2 -RGO Nanocomposites.GO was prepared according to the modification of Hummers methods as described previously 17.Typically, 0.05 g as-prepared GO dissolves in the 250 mL water in the 500 mL round-bottom flask, yielding an inhomogeneous yellow-brown dispersion.This dispersion was sonicated 20 min using an ultrasonic bath cleaner (Fisher Scientific KQ5200) until it became clear with no visible particulate matter.TiO 2 nanoparticles (0.10 g) were then added into the flask, and the mixture was stirred for 24 h at room temperature.Then hydrazine monohydrate (3.00 mL, 50) was then added to the above as-prepared product (TiO 2 -GO), and the suspension was heated in an oil bath at 100 C under a water-cooled condenser for 24 h, where the RGO sheets gradually precipitated out as a black solid and gradually form the TiO 2 -RGO.This product (Cat-2) was isolated by filtration over a medium fritted glass funnel, washed copiously with water and methanol, and dried under vacuum at 60 C.
