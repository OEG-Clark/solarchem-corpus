In addition, it exhibited 24.7 mol g -1 h -1 CH 4 evolutions with high 91.1 CH 4 selectivity.An effective S-scheme transfer mechanism is active in the heterojunction as confirmed by In-situ XPS, DFT calculations and band structure analysis.The high adsorption potential, high charge separation, high potential VB CB are responsible for high methane selectivity.Also, the selective coordination of CO 2 to form bridging intermediate TiCOO -Ti (via unpaired electron) leads to selective CH 4 formation.In addition, presence of two metal active sites (Fe and Ti) forms Fe-C-O-Ti intermediate which exclusively produces CH 4 by dissociation of C-H bonds via continuous protonation.The effect of CO 2 /H 2 O feed ratio, alkali activation, reducing agents and light source onto CO 2 photo-reduction was also investigated.A TC degradation route was also proposed according to LC-MS analysis and ESR probe (both O 2 -and OH radicals active).The designed FT30/BCN heterojunction exhibits superior structural stability and performance during cycling tests both for TC degradation and CO 2 photoreduction.This work elucidates a robust and well-designed heterojunction photocatalyst with strong redox capacity for meeting the dual demands of water detoxification and solar-to-fuel conversion.

The specific surface areas for FeTiO 2 and FT30/BCN were calculated as 32.1 m 2 /g and 74.4 m 2 /g, respectively.The adsorption isotherms (Figure S1) belong to typical type-IV isotherm with H3 type hysteresis loop.The mean pore volume and pore size for FeTiO 2 were 0.14 cm 3 /g, and 21.1 nm, respectively.The pore size and pore volume for FT30/BCN were 16.1 nm and 0.23 cm 3 /g, respectively.The surface area is increased on inclusion of BCN into FeTiO 2 which leads to increase in active sites, promoting the photocatalytic activity.The pore volume increased on inclusion of BCN because of improved dispersity of BCN and FeTiO 2 and the re-creation of pores.It is well known that a large surface area and porous structure favour the enhancement of the photocatalytic property via providing more active sites, accelerating the mass transfer or diffusion.The high surface area improves the photon utilization efficiency by providing more exposure and multiple reflections along the pores. The electronic environment, elemental composition and oxidation states of BCN and FT30/BCN were investigated by XPS analysis (Fig. 3).The survey scan (Figure S2) shows the presence of B, C, N in BCN and Fe, Ti, O, B, C, N in the FT30/BCN composite catalyst.In addition the XPS spectra were also obtained for FT30/BCN photocatalyst after visible light illumination to ascertain the binding energy shifts.Fig. 3(a) shows the B1s spectra for BCN and FT30/BCN.The spectra is deconvoluted into two peaks at 189.4 eV (B1) and 190.1 eV (B2) corresponding to B-C and B-N bonds respectively in BCN (Chang et al., 2013).For FT30/BCN heterojunction, in absence of light irradiation, slightly positive shift in B. E is exhibited compared to bare BCN.This signifies that electrons shift from BCN to FeTiO 2 .After light irradiation, a negative shift in B.E signifies, the electrons transfer from FeTiO 2 towards BCN (Kumar et al., 2020a).These findings are supported by C 1s, Ti 2p and O 1s spectra.(Zhou et al., 2018).The B.E exhibits positive shifts in FT30/BCN without light irradiation and negative shift upon illumination.This confirms the electrons shift from BCN towards FeTiO 2 towards on contact and FeTiO 2 to BCN upon illumination.These observations can be further verified from Ti 2p and O 1s spectra.Fig. 3(c) shows the deconvoluted Ti 2p spectra at 459.4 and 465.3 eV, assigned to Ti 2p 3/2 and Ti 2p 1/2 , respectively for Ti 4 oxidation state in TiO 2 (Li et al., 2020b).The peak at 459.9 eV corresponds to Ti 2p 1/2 for Ti 3 oxidation state.Thus both the oxidation states for Ti exist in the material.The Ti 2p spectra for the junction FT30/BCN shows negative shift in binding energies, confirming the electron shift from BCN to FeTiO 2 .Upon illumination B.E for Ti 2p shifts towards higher side, confirming the electron f low from FeTiO 2 towards BCN. The high-resolution O 1s XPS spectra for FT30/BCN (Fig. 3(d)) show three peaks at 528.5, 529.8 and 530.8 eV corresponding to lattice oxygen (metal-O bond), oxygen vacancies, loosely bound O/adsorbed OH groups respectively (Dhiman et al., 2017).The N 1s spectra (Fig. 3(e)) is deconvoluted into three peaks at 399.9, 401.2 and 402.8 eV which can be assigned to N-B, N-C and N-H bonds respectively (Zhou et al., 2020).The Fe 2p spectrum (Fig. 3(e)) shows two peaks at 715.6 and 729.4 eV corresponding 2p 3/2 and 2p 1/2 oxidation states for Fe 2 oxidation state.The peak positioned at 737.3 eV is assigned to 2p 1/2 for Fe 3 oxidation state.The satellite peak at 721.6 eV confirsm the presence of both Fe 2 and Fe 3 oxidation states.The Ti 3 oxidation state in the catalyst exists due to the generation of oxygen vacancies (OVs reduce the Ti 4 ) (Ye et al., 2021).Comparing the Ti 2p and O 1s spectra in FeTiO2 and FT30/BCN we can observe that there are changes in intensities of Ti as well as O 1s.There are changes in oxygen vacancies in the heterojunction as compared to FeTiO2 which will certainly change the intensity of Ti 3 . The B.E shifts confirm that after the contact between FeTiO 2 and BCN to form the FT/BCN heterojunction, there is electron transfer from BCN to FeTiO 2 .This migration is actually caused by difference in Fermi levels of two semiconductors.As BCN has a higher Fermi level than FeTiO 2 (see DFT calculations discussed later) the difference will drive the migration of electrons from BCN to FeTiO 2 until Fermi levels are aligned (Xia et al., 2020).Thus an internal electric field is created at the semiconductors interface.After illumination the band edge positioning and the internal electric field lead to migration of electrons from FeTiO 2 to BCN by an effective S-scheme transfer.The detailed analysis has been discussed in subsequent sections. The morphology and microstructure of BCN and FT30/BCN was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).Fig. 4(a) shows that exfoliated BCN exhibits lamellar sheets like morphology.The low resolution SEM image of FT30/BCN (Fig. 4 b) shows the spherical FeTiO 2 nanoparticles distributed uniformly over the irregular porous sheet of BCN.The high resolution image further shows that the spherical and uniform FeTiO 2 nanoparticles are in intimate contact with BCN sheets (Fig. 4(c)).Further microstructure was ascertained by TEM analysis.The lamellar nanosheets structure of exfoliated BCN can be observed in Fig. 4(d).The TEM image of FT30/BCN (Fig. 4(e)) confirms the uniform distribution of the spherical FeTiO 2 nanoparticles on to the BCN nanosheets.The high intimate contact between the two is surely beneficial for the electron flow and hence the photocatalytic activity.The HRTEM image (Fig. 4(f)) confirms the intimate contact and crystallinity.The lattice fringes of FeTiO 2 can be seen and the data matches with the XRD findings.However, due to poor crystallinity of BCN, it is difficult to observe the lattice fringes for the same.The presence of distributed Ti, O, Fe, B, C and N elements in FT30/BCN is shown in the SEM elemental mapping and corresponding elemental distribution (Fig. 4 g-m).This further demonstrates the close interfacial contact of two components and successful formation of the binary heterojunction. The light absorption properties of BCN, FeTiO 2 and FT30/BCN were characterized by the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-vis DRS) shown in Fig. 5(a).The BCN obviously absorbs in the visible range with absorption edge near 580 nm TiO 2 has a higher band gap with absorption in UV region.However, with 1.5 Fe doping, the absorption edge shows red shift with a better absorption in visible region.The heterojunction FT30/BCN shows a high absorption edge as compared to FeTiO 2 because oof inclusion of low band gap BCN.The increased optical harvesting improves quantum efficiency and photoredox catalysis.The band gap energy (E g ) was caluclated using Kubelka-Munk function (Kumar et al., 2020c).Therefore, the E g values for FeTiO 2 and BCN were estimated to be 2.70 and 2.45 eV, respectively (Fig. 5(b)). The band gap energy for FT30/BCN heterojunction (Figure S3) was found to be 2.57 eV.Further, Mott-Schottky function was utilized to estimate flat band potential (V FB ) as shown in Fig. 5(c-d).The V FB for BCN and FeTiO 2 are found to be 0.1 V and -1.0 V vs NHE respectively. The conduction band edge (E CB ) for an n-type semiconductor (as can be seen in M -S plots that both semiconductors are n-type) is generally 0.1-0.2eV (vs NHE) below the flat band energy (Kumar et al., 2020a). Considering the difference as 0.2 eV, the CB edges are calculated as -1.2 eV and -0.19 eV vs NHE for BCN and FeTiO 2 respectively.Finally, the VB edges (E VB ) were found to be 1.25 eV and 2.51 eV vs NHE for BCN and FeTiO 2 respectively.Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) derived Nyquist plots for BCN, FeTiO 2 and FT30/BCN are shown in Fig. 5(e).Evidently, FT30/BCN exhibits smallest arc radius as compared to bare semiconductors inferring that the heterojunction has lowest charge transfer resistance or highest transfer capacity.The photo-current density (Fig. 5 (f)) of FT30/BCN is significantly enhanced on the junction formation between FeTiO 2 and BCN which is consistent with EIS findings.The high photocurrent response (PCR) of the junction is attributed to higher visible absorption, high charge transfer capacity, reduced recombination and electron aggregation.This was further supported by photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy findings (Fig. 5(g)).The PL intensity falls dramatically in the heterojunction, suggesting that electron-hole recombination is highly diminished.Interestingly, the charge separation improves with increase in content of FeTiO 2 in BCN i. e from FT10/BCN to FT30/BCN.In addition, to elucidate the photo-induced electrons transfer direction and mechanism active at the FeTiO 2 and BCN interface, DFT calculations were employed.The DFT calculation was used to measure the electron density difference between the semiconductors.Fig. 5 (h) shows that FeTiO 2 is a typical oxidation photocatalyst (OP) with a large work function of 6.70 eV.On the other hand, BCN has a lower work function (3.51 eV) (Fig. 5(i)) and is a reduction photocatalyst (RP) quite similar to carbon nitride (Fu et al., 2019).Generally, the Fermi level position is inversely related to the work function.Fig. 9(a-c) shows the electron transfer mechanism in FT/BCN heterojunction.Thus, the Fermi level of BCN is higher than FeTiO 2 Before contact, the CB and VB positioning of FeTiO 2 and BCN shows that they form a staggered arrangement.After contact, the electrons spontaneously migrate from BCN towards FeTiO 2 across their interface until Fermi levels reach equilibrium.The electron output from BCN results in the bending of CB edge upwards.On the contrary, the band edge of FeTiO 2 gets bent downwards because of accumulation of electrons.Hence an internal electric field is set-up.The movement of electrons from BCN leads to formation of internal electric field which further prevents the further migration from BCN to FeTiO 2. On illumination, the electrons and holes get excited in both the semiconductors and the electrons from CB of FeTiO 2 gets migrated to VB of BCN and recombine with holes.This is facilitated by internal electric field and Coulomb interaction.These facts are supported by B.E shifts in XPS findings.The detailed mechanism is discussed in subsequent directions. Systematic tetracycline (TC) photocatalytic degradation experiments were conducted under visible light irradiation using 300 W Xe lamp (with visible light filter).Considering, the adsorption equilibrium, the stirring was performed under dark conditions for 30 min.Figure S4 shows that FT30/BCN shows 87.1 TC removal in 90 min with 31.2 adsorption in dark in 30 min.From 22.1 to 31.1 there is no substantial improvement in adsorption potential as we move from BCN to FT30/ BCN.However, FT30/BCN shows highest adsorption capacity because of high surface area and active sites as also supported by BET adsorption isotherms results.Secondly, under direct exposure, better performance was recorded as can be seen in Fig. 6(a).As shown, after 60 min visible light treatment, the TC removal rates of 45.1, 52.3, 70.1, 85.4, 93.1 and 96.2 were obtained in presence of BCN, FeTiO 2 , FT10/ BCN, FT20/BCN, FT40/BCN and FT30/BCN respectively.There is a substantial improvement in the TC removal rate for FT30/BCN as compared to bare BCN and FeTiO 2 which is due to higher visible capture capacity, reduced recombination and high charge transfer capacity on formation of heterojunction.With increase in content of FeTiO 2 in BCN, the TC degradation increases dramatically, but with very high content i. e 40FeTiO 2 the TC removal decreased.This is attributed to the fact that excess of FeTiO 2 not only hinders the interfacial contact, but also redundant material acts as recombination centres ().The high performance of FT30/BCN is supported by observations from UV-DRS, EIS, PCR and PL measurements.The pseudo-firstorder kinetic analysis for TC degradation is revealed in Fig. 6(b).The plots show that reaction rate for FT30/BCN (k app 0.7123 min -1 ) is nearly 7 times that of bare BCN (0.01246 min -1 ). During the photocatalytic process, pH, presence of electrolytes, water matrix and light source tend to affect the catalyst performance via controlling the surface charge distribution and production of active oxygen species.Fig. 6(c) shows that initial pH has a pronounced effect on the TC degradation by FT30/BCN under visible light.The highest TC removal was found to be 96.2 at pH 5.4 and this was chosen as optimized pH for all the experiments.TC possesses three different pKa values, i. e 3.30, 7.7 and 9.7 (Yi et al., 2020).The pH, pKa and pzc of the catalyst govern the interactions with the TC molecules and also control the strength of hydroxyl and superoxide radical anions in the system.The drug exists as (i) H 4 TC at pH 3.3, (ii) H 3 TC in the pH 3.3-7.7,(iii) H 2 TC -in the pH 7.7-9.7 and (iv) HTC 2-at pH 12.The higher degradation at pH 5.5 could be attributed to the attractive electrostatic force between H 3 TC and FT30/BCN (pzc 7.2).Highly acidic medium limits the adsorption due to repulsive forces and similar behaviour is expected at very high pH.Also, the alkaline medium leads to quenching of OH radicals (Kumar et al., 2020a). Further, effect of some common cations and anions onto TC removal with FT30/BCN catalyst was studied and results are shown in Fig. 6(d).Evidently it can be seen that Cl -and Na ions have no noticeable effect on the photocatalytic efficiency.It's worth mentioning that NO 3 -ions promote in the TC photodegradation (k app 0.07622 min -1 ).This is attributed to the fact that NO 3 -forms excited state on visible light irradiation to form NO 2 and OH which accelerates the TC degradation. On the other hand, HCO 3 -ions have an detrimental effect on TC removal (k app 0.06061 min -1 ) because they consume OH radicals to produce CO 3 -radicals.These radicals are less reactive than hydroxyl radicals and thus the degradation rate falls.The degree of inhibition is higher in case of SO 4 2-ions because they are effective radical scavengers (Tang et al., 2020b).However, Mg 2 showed little inhibitory effect, which may be attributed decrease of pH value and Ca 2 cause inhibition in TC removal because they tend to form co-ordination complexes with the drug molecule (Liu et al., 2020) and similar observations have been found in our previous works too (Kumar et al., 2020a).It is well known that Ca 2 ions form 1:2 ligand:metal complex with TC via chelation (Wessels et al., 1998).As it was observed that inorganic ions have a significant on the TC removal rate, we tested the degradation efficiency in real water system i. e river water, tap water and municipal water (Fig. 6(e)).The water quality parameters are listed in table S1.The TC removal efficiency of 96.2, 93.4, 92.3 and 94.1 in distilled water (DW), Municipal drinking water (MW), tap water (TW) and river water (RW) respectively.Definitely, presence of various ions, natural organic matter etc. leads to variation in the performance in various water matrices.However, it is clearly inferred that FT30/BCN heterojunction has a high potential in practical purification of waste water.Further, the TC degradation efficiency and total organic carbon (TOC) with FT30/BCN catalyst was tested under visible and solar light (Fig. 6(f)).Under natural solar light, 84.1 and 81.2 TC was removed in 60 min in DW and RW respectively.A high mineralization was also reported with 77.2 and 64.3 TOC removal in 2 h under visible and solar light in distilled water.A high TC degradation and TOC removal in river water both under visible light and solar light.This again establishes the findings that FT30/BCN heterojunction has a promising future in real waste water treatment. Radical scavenging experiments were performed to assess the role of reactive oxygen species involved in TC degradation under visible light.Fig. 6(g) shows the effect of 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1oxyl (TEMPOL), isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) as scavengers for et al., 2021).P7 with m/z 384 stemmed from the C-N bond cleavage from P6. P5 with m/z 396 was the by-product of TC methylation.P4 is decomposed into P6 (m/z 413) through the ring-opening process.P6 is continuously oxidized and decomposed to P8 (m/z 256) (ring break and removal of -COOH and -OH groups) and P9 (m/z 218).Further oxidations and decomposition via ring opening leads to formation of simpler moieties with m/Z 159 and 102 (Derikvandi et al., 2021).The intermediates are consistent with reported findings (Tang et al., 2020b).Further oxidation leads to formation of simpler aliphatic molecules and mineralized in longer run into inorganic compounds and gases as supported by high TOC removal findings. A suitable photocatalytic mechanism was predicted on basis of XPS, scavenging experiments, DFT calculations and ESR findings.The ESR DMPO- O 2 -spectrum (Fig. 6(h)) shows high intensity peaks (1:1:1:1) under visible light and no peaks in dark.This suggests that O 2 -radicals are major active species responsible for TC degradation and are present in higher concentration.Also, the DMPO- OH spectrum shows low intensity spectra (1:2:2:1) suggesting a little role of OH radicals in the degradation reaction.These results are supported by scavenging experiments.The thermodynamic feasibility of radical generation can be understood by analysing the band structure.As discussed earlier, from DFT calculations it was found that FeTiO 2 with a higher work function and low fermi level is a typical Oxidation type photocatalyst (OP).On the contrast, BCN has a lower work function with high Fermi level as for a typical reduction photocatalyst (RP).Thus, on contact (Fig. 7(b)) the electrons flow from BCN to FeTiO till Fermi levels align and the built-in electric field further restricts the movement of electrons.However, on exposure, as the electron-holes are produced in BCN and FeTiO 2 , the electrons move from CB of FeTiO towards VB of BCN benefitting from internal electric field, band bending (discussed earlier) and Coulomb interactions.The electrons from CB of FeTiO 2 (-0.19 eV) easily recombine with holes in VB of BCN (1.25 eV).However the recombination of electrons from BCN CB and holes from VB of FeTiO 2 is restrained by internal electric field.Thus a Step scheme (S-scheme) is operational here.The charge transfer in the Sscheme mechanism is shown in Fig. 7(c).Thus, the relatively useless photogenerated electrons in CB of FeTiO 2 (-0.19 eV) because they don't have enough energy for generation of The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O was tested under visible light without using any organic sacrificial reagent.Without use of Scheme 1. Possible degradation route of TC. any catalyst no gases were detected.The two major products detected were CH 4 and CO and traces of CH 3 OH.No or non-detectable hydrogen gas was evolved.Fig. 8 (a) and (b) shows the CO 2 conversion efficiency into CH 4 and CO with time respectively.The pristine BCN exhibits very low photocatalytic efficiency with 30.1 mol g -1 CH 4 evolution in 5 h of visible light irradiation.The sample FT30/BCN shows best photocatalytic performance with 123.2 mol g -1 and 10.3 mol g -1 CH 4 and CO evolution respectively.The cumulative CH 4 and CO evolution showing the selectivity of various samples is shown in Fig. 8(c).The CH 4 evolution follows the order: FT30/BCN (24.7 mol g -1 h -1 ) FT40/ BCN (20.4 mol g -1 h -1 ) FT20/BCN (18.4 mol g -1 h -1 ) FT10/BCN (14.2 mol g -1 h -1 ) FeTiO 2 (9.3 mol g -1 h -1 ) BCN (3.6 mol g -1 h -1 ).Comparing the gas evolution rates, it can be seen that FT30/BCN shows highest CH 4 evolution with 91.1 CH 4 selectivity (poor CO evolution 3.6 mol g -1 h -1 ).The average gas evolution, total electrons consumed in reduction and CH 4 selectivity of all samples is listed in Table 1.Comparing with the single catalyst BCN, it is observed that for BCN CO is evolved in higher amounts than CH 4 .However, CH 4 selectivity is higher in FeTiO 2 , though total efficiency is quite low.FT30/ BCN shows highest CH 4 selectivity.Owing to higher recombination rate and poor charge separation, the CO 2 conversion is poor in single semiconductors.However, on formation of heterojunction, dramatic conversion efficiency and CH 4 selectivity is observed.The performance is enhanced owing to following reasons: Firstly the improved quantum efficiency on junction formation, higher charge separation and effective S-scheme transfer mechanism as discussed in earlier sections.Secondly, the BCN nanosheets allow enough CO 2 adsorption and better binding of CO 2 molecules to the metal ions for higher reduction rate as more active sites ensure higher reduction (He et al., 2020).With the higher charge separation facilitated by built-in electric field in the heterojunction, more electrons are produced with time having high redox capability which brings about high CO 2 photoreduction.As seen in Scheme 2, the CH 4 evolution is an 8H /8e -reaction and CO formation is 2H /2e - reaction.Thus kinetically CO formation is favoured, however, CH 4 evolution is thermodynamically favourable.The thermodynamic and kinetic control thus plays important role in the selectivity (Li et al., 2020a). It has been well documented that hydrogen evolution (via water splitting) often competes with and CO 2 reduction (Li et al., 2012).However, non-detectable i. e extremely low yield, H 2 was evolved during the photocatalytic reaction. Firstly, the CO 2 photo-reduction performance was tested under alkali activation i. e using 0.2 M NaOH solution instead of distilled water.Fig. 8(d) shows the CH 4 evolution in 5 h time course under alkali activation.It can be observed that the CH 4 evolution increased to high extent for each catalyst i. e BCN, FeTiO 2 , FT10/BCN and FT30/BCN.For best performing FT30/BCN photocatalyst, under alkali activation, the CH 4 yield gets nearly doubled from 123.2 mol g -1 to 214.5 mol g -1 .The increase in CH 4 evolution is more prominent in heterojunction than in single semiconductors BCN and FeTiO 2 .The increase in the methane yield with alkali activation is attributed to following reasonsthe presence of alkalinity improves the CO 2 solubility and hydroxyl radical formation.The formation of hydroxyl radicals supports the electron-holes separation and favours CO 2 reduction. The photocatalytic performance of FT30/BCN heterojunction was further tested with variation of initial CO 2 /H 2 O feed ratio and keeping rest of parameters same.During the experiment, when CO 2 is passed through water saturator, the quantity of H 2 O vapors carried by CO 2 is dependent on the water vapour pressure.The high temperature favours more water vapors which makes CO 2 more saturated with H 2 O and thus the CO 2 /H 2 O feed ratio will be low.Conversely, low temperature leads to higher CO 2 /H 2 O feed ratio.The temperature of water saturator was maintained at 20, 30 and 40 C. Thus at 10 C, the feed contains highest CO 2 and at 40 C has lowest CO 2 content.Fig. 8(e) shows the effect of CO 2 /H 2 O feed ratio on photo-reduction of CO 2 under visible light with FT30/BCN.The performance order for CH 4 evolution in 5 h is as follows: 123.2 mol g -1 (30 C) 94.5 mol g -1 (40 C) and 70.2 mol g -1 (20 C).At 10 C (high CO 2 /H 2 O feed ratio) the CH 4 yield is lowest.The production rate increased at 30 C and then declined at 40 C further.At higher CO 2 /H 2 O feed ratio, more CO 2 gets attached to the photocatalyst surface and occupies to more active sites as compared to H 2 O molecules.The quantity of H 2 O molecules will thus not be enough to carry out the oxidation and produce lesser H and also lead to higher recombination.So when temperature is increased to higher temperature 40 C (lower CO 2 /H 2 O feed ratio), more of H 2 O molecules gets attached to catalytic sites and would lower the photocatalytic rate.The best performance is achieved at 30 C when appropriate number of H 2 O and CO 2 molecules gets attached to surface resulting in enough oxidation and reduction reactions with diminished recombination rate.In general higher H 2 O content would favour more CH 4 production, but very high content will hamper the photocatalytic reaction rate (Tahir and Tahir, 2020). Further, we investigated the performance of FT30/BCN composite photocatalyst using different reducing agents (H 2 O, methanol and H 2 ) Fig. 7.The S-scheme heterojunction of FeTiO 2 /BCN (a) before contact, (b) after contact, and (c) after contact upon irradiation and charge migration and separation.and light source (visible and solar light) (Fig. 8 f).Under all the experiments CH 4 and CO were the major products.With CO 2 water system, under visible light as discussed earlier higher CH 4 production (123 mol g -1 ) was obtained.With MeOH (methanol) as reducing agent, high yields of CH 4 (160.2mol g -1 ) and CO (18.6 mol g -1 ) were obtained.The CH 4 evolution under CO 2 MeOH was 1.3 times that of CO 2 H 2 O system.No hydrogen was detected.In CO 2 H 2 system also, appreciable quantity of CH 4 and CO were evolved.But the CO evolution was higher as compared to CH 4 with hydrogen as reducing agent which is consistent with earlier findings (Tahir et al., 2020).With methanol due to more protons (H ) production the CH 4 removal was significantly enhanced.Thus reducing agents have a pronounced effect on CO 2 conversion efficiency and CH 4 selectivity.Under solar light CO 2 H 2 O system a high CH 4 evolution 98.7 mol g -1 in 5 h is obtained with high selectivity.Thus, FT30/BCN photocatalyst is capable of efficient solar-to-fuel conversion with high selectivity and promising in real fuel production applications. As discussed earlier, the CH 4 evolution is an 8e -/8H reaction progressed by multiple steps and also via a multiple proton-coupled electron transfer route for high methane selectivity.With the progress of photocatalytic reaction, more photogenerated electrons are produced.Because of an effective S-scheme transfer between FeTiO 2 and BCN a high electron-holes separation is ensured.The FT30/BCN photocatalyst shows high charge transfer capacity, photocurrent response and highly diminished electron-hole recombination.Thus more electrons are available for high and selective CH 4 production.The pzc of the photocatalyst is 7.2 and thus slightly basic characteristics favour more CO 2 adsorption and hydrogenation too.Secondly it can be explained in The average gas evolution rates and CH 4 selectivity for various samples under visible light. Gas evolution (mol g another way that because of presence of RGO basic characteristics are induced on surface of ABR catalyst as pzc is 7.4, CO 2 adsorption and hydrogenation is favoured.The conversion of CO 2 into CO is a more favoured step involving 2H / 2e -mechanism.The S-scheme transfer mechanism which has already been discussed in previous sections saves the electrons and holes in high potential conduction band and valence band respectively.The redox potential for E o (CO/CO 2 ) -0.42eV and E o (CH 4 /CO 2 ) -0.24eV.The electrons accumulated in CB of BCN (-1.2 eV) are capable of for reducing CO 2 to CH 4 by route involving by single step multi electron transfer with proton coupling.The holes accumulated in VB of FeTiO 2 (2.51 eV) have high potential to produce protons from water.Thus the higher charge separation and availability of high potential electrons favour the high conversion efficiency and CH 4 selectivity.Also the short diffusion length of thin exfoliated BCN nanosheets generates more electrons on visible light exposure and favours CH 4 production.As seen in O 1s XPS spectrum in FT30/BCN, there are numerous O vacancies on the surface which trap electrons generated by BCN and FeTiO 2 and boost the photocatalytic activity.Furthermore, isotope experiment with 13 CO 2 and 12 CO 2 were performed for visible light CO 2 H 2 O FT30/BCN system (Figure S5).The existence of peaks at m/z 16 and m/z 17 for CH 4 shows that reduction products are reduced from the CO 2 and not by any other reaction or route. We have also predicted two more mechanisms for high CH 4 selectivity with FT30/BCN catalyst as shown in Fig. 9.It has been reported earlier also that selectivity can be increased via coordination activation.As seen in Ti 2p XPS spectrum, Ti 3 is present on TiO 2 surface and will act as an active site with presence of unpaired electrons.The CO 2 molecules get adsorbed onto photocatalyst via coordination to lewis base site i. e Ti 3 for instance (Sree et al., 2009).As seen in Fig. 9(a), The bridging TiCOO -Ti will be formed on TiO 2 sites located uniformly on thin BCN nanosheets.The adsorbed CO 2 molecules can interact with Ti 3 (as shown in Figure ) via an interfacial charge transfer mechanism thereby decreasing the required activation energy.On exposure to light, the 2 photo-generated electrons will transfer to the co-ordinated CO 2 molecules i. e TiC.Simultaneously, the H (protons) get connected into TiCOO -Ti via electrostatic forces of attraction to form TiHCOO -Ti intermediate as reported in a related previous work (Wang et al., 2021).This intermediate further gets converted into TiHCHO -Ti and TiCH 3 O -Ti which via further protonation and electron transfer (shown in Fig. 9(a)) leads to detachment of CH 4 molecule from catalyst surface.On the other hand, the holes (h ) would generate hydroxyl radicals.This explains the highly selective CH 4 formation.Fig. 9(b) shows the other way for CH 4 formation.The presence of FeTiO 2 facilitates two metal sites on to FT30/BCN heterojunction photcatalyst.Thus, Fe and Ti both can bond concurrently with C and O atoms (in CO 2 -as shown in figure)to form Fe-C-O-Ti i. e M 1 -C-O-M 2 reaction intermediate which favours only CH 4 formation.This is attributed to the fact that it is not easy to break both M 1 -C and M 2 -O bonds simultaneously.On the contrast, it's rather easy to dissociate C-H bonds via continuous protonation which weakens the M 1 -C and M 2 -O bonds simultaneously and produce CH 4 (Jiao et al., 2020). The in-situ XPS characterization, DFT analysis, scavenging experiments probe and band structure analysis predicts an exclusive S-scheme electron transfer mechanism for efficient electron separation and charge transfer capacity for efficient CO 2 reduction. The stability and reusability of the photocatalyst FT30/BCN was tested both for photocatalytic TC degradation and CO 2 reduction.Figure S6 shows that there is no abnormal loss in the activity of FT30/ BCN for TC degradation under visible light.A negligible fall in the TC removal rate was observed.The XRD pattern and SEM micrograph of FT30/BCN (Figure S7) obtained after reuse and recovery shows there is no change the structure and morphology.Thus catalyst is robust, highly stable and recyclable.Further, metal leaching tests were performed for Fe and Ti using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) (Agilent 8800 ICP-QQQ).Figure S8 shows that at pH 2 minor leaching rates were observed for Fe (0.03) and Ti (0.027).The leaching rates are negligible at pH 4.The ultra-low/negligible leaching shows the FT30/BCN photocatalyst is highly stable and does not promote secondary pollution.The catalytic stability of FT30/BCN was further investigated by carrying out the CO 2 reduction under visible light (Figure S9).It can be observed that the high rate of CH 4 evolution is maintained for three cycles i. e 15 h of experiment."}, {"llm generation": "visible light", "source": "The ESR DMPO- O 2 -spectrum (Fig. 6(h)) shows high intensity peaks (1:1:1:1) under visible light and no peaks in dark.", "context": "3.1.Characterization Fig. 2 (a) shows the XRD patterns of synthesized photocatalysts.The XRD pattern for BCN shows a peak at 26.7 corresponding to graphitic structure of pristine boron carbon nitride which is well matched with ICDD PDF 53-0447.The peak at 43.1 corresponds to the (111) diffraction planes of BCN in sync with ICDD PDF 51-0768) (Chen et al., 2018).For Fe doped TiO 2 , the diffraction peaks corresponding to (110), ( 101), ( 200), ( 111), ( 210), ( 211), ( 220), ( 002), (311), and ( 112) are observed corresponding to tetragonal rutile TiO 2 which is in good agreement with (JCPDS No. 21-1276) (Wang et al., 2015).A slight shift is observed in 2 values as compared to pure rutile TiO 2 from literature because of doping as there is a difference in ionic radii of Fe and Ti.Fe doped TiO 2 is present in single phase without any trace of clusters of Fe as doping of Fe has been done on Ti sites in TiO 2 matrix.As doping content is less than 5 atomic there is no formation of any secondary phase related to Fe.The XRD patterns of binary junction series as FT/BCN show characteristic peaks of both FeTiO 2 and BCN with no extra phases.The peak intensities for BCN are highly reduced in the heterojunction.Change in intensities is observed which is due to variable content of BCN and FeTiO 2 and also due to the crystallinity differences between the two. The specific surface areas for FeTiO 2 and FT30/BCN were calculated as 32.1 m 2 /g and 74.4 m 2 /g, respectively.The adsorption isotherms (Figure S1) belong to typical type-IV isotherm with H3 type hysteresis loop.The mean pore volume and pore size for FeTiO 2 were 0.14 cm 3 /g, and 21.1 nm, respectively.The pore size and pore volume for FT30/BCN were 16.1 nm and 0.23 cm 3 /g, respectively.The surface area is increased on inclusion of BCN into FeTiO 2 which leads to increase in active sites, promoting the photocatalytic activity.The pore volume increased on inclusion of BCN because of improved dispersity of BCN and FeTiO 2 and the re-creation of pores.It is well known that a large surface area and porous structure favour the enhancement of the photocatalytic property via providing more active sites, accelerating the mass transfer or diffusion.The high surface area improves the photon utilization efficiency by providing more exposure and multiple reflections along the pores. The electronic environment, elemental composition and oxidation states of BCN and FT30/BCN were investigated by XPS analysis (Fig. 3).The survey scan (Figure S2) shows the presence of B, C, N in BCN and Fe, Ti, O, B, C, N in the FT30/BCN composite catalyst.In addition the XPS spectra were also obtained for FT30/BCN photocatalyst after visible light illumination to ascertain the binding energy shifts.Fig. 3(a) shows the B1s spectra for BCN and FT30/BCN.The spectra is deconvoluted into two peaks at 189.4 eV (B1) and 190.1 eV (B2) corresponding to B-C and B-N bonds respectively in BCN (Chang et al., 2013).For FT30/BCN heterojunction, in absence of light irradiation, slightly positive shift in B. E is exhibited compared to bare BCN.This signifies that electrons shift from BCN to FeTiO 2 .After light irradiation, a negative shift in B.E signifies, the electrons transfer from FeTiO 2 towards BCN (Kumar et al., 2020a).These findings are supported by C 1s, Ti 2p and O 1s spectra.(Zhou et al., 2018).The B.E exhibits positive shifts in FT30/BCN without light irradiation and negative shift upon illumination.This confirms the electrons shift from BCN towards FeTiO 2 towards on contact and FeTiO 2 to BCN upon illumination.These observations can be further verified from Ti 2p and O 1s spectra.Fig. 3(c) shows the deconvoluted Ti 2p spectra at 459.4 and 465.3 eV, assigned to Ti 2p 3/2 and Ti 2p 1/2 , respectively for Ti 4 oxidation state in TiO 2 (Li et al., 2020b).The peak at 459.9 eV corresponds to Ti 2p 1/2 for Ti 3 oxidation state.Thus both the oxidation states for Ti exist in the material.The Ti 2p spectra for the junction FT30/BCN shows negative shift in binding energies, confirming the electron shift from BCN to FeTiO 2 .Upon illumination B.E for Ti 2p shifts towards higher side, confirming the electron f low from FeTiO 2 towards BCN. The high-resolution O 1s XPS spectra for FT30/BCN (Fig. 3(d)) show three peaks at 528.5, 529.8 and 530.8 eV corresponding to lattice oxygen (metal-O bond), oxygen vacancies, loosely bound O/adsorbed OH groups respectively (Dhiman et al., 2017).The N 1s spectra (Fig. 3(e)) is deconvoluted into three peaks at 399.9, 401.2 and 402.8 eV which can be assigned to N-B, N-C and N-H bonds respectively (Zhou et al., 2020).The Fe 2p spectrum (Fig. 3(e)) shows two peaks at 715.6 and 729.4 eV corresponding 2p 3/2 and 2p 1/2 oxidation states for Fe 2 oxidation state.The peak positioned at 737.3 eV is assigned to 2p 1/2 for Fe 3 oxidation state.The satellite peak at 721.6 eV confirsm the presence of both Fe 2 and Fe 3 oxidation states.The Ti 3 oxidation state in the catalyst exists due to the generation of oxygen vacancies (OVs reduce the Ti 4 ) (Ye et al., 2021).Comparing the Ti 2p and O 1s spectra in FeTiO2 and FT30/BCN we can observe that there are changes in intensities of Ti as well as O 1s.There are changes in oxygen vacancies in the heterojunction as compared to FeTiO2 which will certainly change the intensity of Ti 3 . The B.E shifts confirm that after the contact between FeTiO 2 and BCN to form the FT/BCN heterojunction, there is electron transfer from BCN to FeTiO 2 .This migration is actually caused by difference in Fermi levels of two semiconductors.As BCN has a higher Fermi level than FeTiO 2 (see DFT calculations discussed later) the difference will drive the migration of electrons from BCN to FeTiO 2 until Fermi levels are aligned (Xia et al., 2020).Thus an internal electric field is created at the semiconductors interface.After illumination the band edge positioning and the internal electric field lead to migration of electrons from FeTiO 2 to BCN by an effective S-scheme transfer.The detailed analysis has been discussed in subsequent sections. The morphology and microstructure of BCN and FT30/BCN was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).Fig. 4(a) shows that exfoliated BCN exhibits lamellar sheets like morphology.The low resolution SEM image of FT30/BCN (Fig. 4 b) shows the spherical FeTiO 2 nanoparticles distributed uniformly over the irregular porous sheet of BCN.The high resolution image further shows that the spherical and uniform FeTiO 2 nanoparticles are in intimate contact with BCN sheets (Fig. 4(c)).Further microstructure was ascertained by TEM analysis.The lamellar nanosheets structure of exfoliated BCN can be observed in Fig. 4(d).The TEM image of FT30/BCN (Fig. 4(e)) confirms the uniform distribution of the spherical FeTiO 2 nanoparticles on to the BCN nanosheets.The high intimate contact between the two is surely beneficial for the electron flow and hence the photocatalytic activity.The HRTEM image (Fig. 4(f)) confirms the intimate contact and crystallinity.The lattice fringes of FeTiO 2 can be seen and the data matches with the XRD findings.However, due to poor crystallinity of BCN, it is difficult to observe the lattice fringes for the same.The presence of distributed Ti, O, Fe, B, C and N elements in FT30/BCN is shown in the SEM elemental mapping and corresponding elemental distribution (Fig. 4 g-m).This further demonstrates the close interfacial contact of two components and successful formation of the binary heterojunction. The light absorption properties of BCN, FeTiO 2 and FT30/BCN were characterized by the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-vis DRS) shown in Fig. 5(a).The BCN obviously absorbs in the visible range with absorption edge near 580 nm TiO 2 has a higher band gap with absorption in UV region.However, with 1.5 Fe doping, the absorption edge shows red shift with a better absorption in visible region.The heterojunction FT30/BCN shows a high absorption edge as compared to FeTiO 2 because oof inclusion of low band gap BCN.The increased optical harvesting improves quantum efficiency and photoredox catalysis.The band gap energy (E g ) was caluclated using Kubelka-Munk function (Kumar et al., 2020c).Therefore, the E g values for FeTiO 2 and BCN were estimated to be 2.70 and 2.45 eV, respectively (Fig. 5(b)). The band gap energy for FT30/BCN heterojunction (Figure S3) was found to be 2.57 eV.Further, Mott-Schottky function was utilized to estimate flat band potential (V FB ) as shown in Fig. 5(c-d).The V FB for BCN and FeTiO 2 are found to be 0.1 V and -1.0 V vs NHE respectively. The conduction band edge (E CB ) for an n-type semiconductor (as can be seen in M -S plots that both semiconductors are n-type) is generally 0.1-0.2eV (vs NHE) below the flat band energy (Kumar et al., 2020a). Considering the difference as 0.2 eV, the CB edges are calculated as -1.2 eV and -0.19 eV vs NHE for BCN and FeTiO 2 respectively.Finally, the VB edges (E VB ) were found to be 1.25 eV and 2.51 eV vs NHE for BCN and FeTiO 2 respectively.Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) derived Nyquist plots for BCN, FeTiO 2 and FT30/BCN are shown in Fig. 5(e).Evidently, FT30/BCN exhibits smallest arc radius as compared to bare semiconductors inferring that the heterojunction has lowest charge transfer resistance or highest transfer capacity.The photo-current density (Fig. 5 (f)) of FT30/BCN is significantly enhanced on the junction formation between FeTiO 2 and BCN which is consistent with EIS findings.The high photocurrent response (PCR) of the junction is attributed to higher visible absorption, high charge transfer capacity, reduced recombination and electron aggregation.This was further supported by photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy findings (Fig. 5(g)).The PL intensity falls dramatically in the heterojunction, suggesting that electron-hole recombination is highly diminished.Interestingly, the charge separation improves with increase in content of FeTiO 2 in BCN i. e from FT10/BCN to FT30/BCN.In addition, to elucidate the photo-induced electrons transfer direction and mechanism active at the FeTiO 2 and BCN interface, DFT calculations were employed.The DFT calculation was used to measure the electron density difference between the semiconductors.Fig. 5 (h) shows that FeTiO 2 is a typical oxidation photocatalyst (OP) with a large work function of 6.70 eV.On the other hand, BCN has a lower work function (3.51 eV) (Fig. 5(i)) and is a reduction photocatalyst (RP) quite similar to carbon nitride (Fu et al., 2019).Generally, the Fermi level position is inversely related to the work function.Fig. 9(a-c) shows the electron transfer mechanism in FT/BCN heterojunction.Thus, the Fermi level of BCN is higher than FeTiO 2 Before contact, the CB and VB positioning of FeTiO 2 and BCN shows that they form a staggered arrangement.After contact, the electrons spontaneously migrate from BCN towards FeTiO 2 across their interface until Fermi levels reach equilibrium.The electron output from BCN results in the bending of CB edge upwards.On the contrary, the band edge of FeTiO 2 gets bent downwards because of accumulation of electrons.Hence an internal electric field is set-up.The movement of electrons from BCN leads to formation of internal electric field which further prevents the further migration from BCN to FeTiO 2. On illumination, the electrons and holes get excited in both the semiconductors and the electrons from CB of FeTiO 2 gets migrated to VB of BCN and recombine with holes.This is facilitated by internal electric field and Coulomb interaction.These facts are supported by B.E shifts in XPS findings.The detailed mechanism is discussed in subsequent directions. Systematic tetracycline (TC) photocatalytic degradation experiments were conducted under visible light irradiation using 300 W Xe lamp (with visible light filter).Considering, the adsorption equilibrium, the stirring was performed under dark conditions for 30 min.Figure S4 shows that FT30/BCN shows 87.1 TC removal in 90 min with 31.2 adsorption in dark in 30 min.From 22.1 to 31.1 there is no substantial improvement in adsorption potential as we move from BCN to FT30/ BCN.However, FT30/BCN shows highest adsorption capacity because of high surface area and active sites as also supported by BET adsorption isotherms results.Secondly, under direct exposure, better performance was recorded as can be seen in Fig. 6(a).As shown, after 60 min visible light treatment, the TC removal rates of 45.1, 52.3, 70.1, 85.4, 93.1 and 96.2 were obtained in presence of BCN, FeTiO 2 , FT10/ BCN, FT20/BCN, FT40/BCN and FT30/BCN respectively.There is a substantial improvement in the TC removal rate for FT30/BCN as compared to bare BCN and FeTiO 2 which is due to higher visible capture capacity, reduced recombination and high charge transfer capacity on formation of heterojunction.With increase in content of FeTiO 2 in BCN, the TC degradation increases dramatically, but with very high content i. e 40FeTiO 2 the TC removal decreased.This is attributed to the fact that excess of FeTiO 2 not only hinders the interfacial contact, but also redundant material acts as recombination centres ().The high performance of FT30/BCN is supported by observations from UV-DRS, EIS, PCR and PL measurements.The pseudo-firstorder kinetic analysis for TC degradation is revealed in Fig. 6(b).The plots show that reaction rate for FT30/BCN (k app 0.7123 min -1 ) is nearly 7 times that of bare BCN (0.01246 min -1 ). During the photocatalytic process, pH, presence of electrolytes, water matrix and light source tend to affect the catalyst performance via controlling the surface charge distribution and production of active oxygen species.Fig. 6(c) shows that initial pH has a pronounced effect on the TC degradation by FT30/BCN under visible light.The highest TC removal was found to be 96.2 at pH 5.4 and this was chosen as optimized pH for all the experiments.TC possesses three different pKa values, i. e 3.30, 7.7 and 9.7 (Yi et al., 2020).The pH, pKa and pzc of the catalyst govern the interactions with the TC molecules and also control the strength of hydroxyl and superoxide radical anions in the system.The drug exists as (i) H 4 TC at pH 3.3, (ii) H 3 TC in the pH 3.3-7.7,(iii) H 2 TC -in the pH 7.7-9.7 and (iv) HTC 2-at pH 12.The higher degradation at pH 5.5 could be attributed to the attractive electrostatic force between H 3 TC and FT30/BCN (pzc 7.2).Highly acidic medium limits the adsorption due to repulsive forces and similar behaviour is expected at very high pH.Also, the alkaline medium leads to quenching of OH radicals (Kumar et al., 2020a). Further, effect of some common cations and anions onto TC removal with FT30/BCN catalyst was studied and results are shown in Fig. 6(d).Evidently it can be seen that Cl -and Na ions have no noticeable effect on the photocatalytic efficiency.It's worth mentioning that NO 3 -ions promote in the TC photodegradation (k app 0.07622 min -1 ).This is attributed to the fact that NO 3 -forms excited state on visible light irradiation to form NO 2 and OH which accelerates the TC degradation. On the other hand, HCO 3 -ions have an detrimental effect on TC removal (k app 0.06061 min -1 ) because they consume OH radicals to produce CO 3 -radicals.These radicals are less reactive than hydroxyl radicals and thus the degradation rate falls.The degree of inhibition is higher in case of SO 4 2-ions because they are effective radical scavengers (Tang et al., 2020b).However, Mg 2 showed little inhibitory effect, which may be attributed decrease of pH value and Ca 2 cause inhibition in TC removal because they tend to form co-ordination complexes with the drug molecule (Liu et al., 2020) and similar observations have been found in our previous works too (Kumar et al., 2020a).It is well known that Ca 2 ions form 1:2 ligand:metal complex with TC via chelation (Wessels et al., 1998).As it was observed that inorganic ions have a significant on the TC removal rate, we tested the degradation efficiency in real water system i. e river water, tap water and municipal water (Fig. 6(e)).The water quality parameters are listed in table S1.The TC removal efficiency of 96.2, 93.4, 92.3 and 94.1 in distilled water (DW), Municipal drinking water (MW), tap water (TW) and river water (RW) respectively.Definitely, presence of various ions, natural organic matter etc. leads to variation in the performance in various water matrices.However, it is clearly inferred that FT30/BCN heterojunction has a high potential in practical purification of waste water.Further, the TC degradation efficiency and total organic carbon (TOC) with FT30/BCN catalyst was tested under visible and solar light (Fig. 6(f)).Under natural solar light, 84.1 and 81.2 TC was removed in 60 min in DW and RW respectively.A high mineralization was also reported with 77.2 and 64.3 TOC removal in 2 h under visible and solar light in distilled water.A high TC degradation and TOC removal in river water both under visible light and solar light.This again establishes the findings that FT30/BCN heterojunction has a promising future in real waste water treatment. Radical scavenging experiments were performed to assess the role of reactive oxygen species involved in TC degradation under visible light.Fig. 6(g) shows the effect of 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1oxyl (TEMPOL), isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) as scavengers for et al., 2021).P7 with m/z 384 stemmed from the C-N bond cleavage from P6. P5 with m/z 396 was the by-product of TC methylation.P4 is decomposed into P6 (m/z 413) through the ring-opening process.P6 is continuously oxidized and decomposed to P8 (m/z 256) (ring break and removal of -COOH and -OH groups) and P9 (m/z 218).Further oxidations and decomposition via ring opening leads to formation of simpler moieties with m/Z 159 and 102 (Derikvandi et al., 2021).The intermediates are consistent with reported findings (Tang et al., 2020b).Further oxidation leads to formation of simpler aliphatic molecules and mineralized in longer run into inorganic compounds and gases as supported by high TOC removal findings. A suitable photocatalytic mechanism was predicted on basis of XPS, scavenging experiments, DFT calculations and ESR findings.The ESR DMPO- O 2 -spectrum (Fig. 6(h)) shows high intensity peaks (1:1:1:1) under visible light and no peaks in dark.This suggests that O 2 -radicals are major active species responsible for TC degradation and are present in higher concentration.Also, the DMPO- OH spectrum shows low intensity spectra (1:2:2:1) suggesting a little role of OH radicals in the degradation reaction.These results are supported by scavenging experiments.The thermodynamic feasibility of radical generation can be understood by analysing the band structure.As discussed earlier, from DFT calculations it was found that FeTiO 2 with a higher work function and low fermi level is a typical Oxidation type photocatalyst (OP).On the contrast, BCN has a lower work function with high Fermi level as for a typical reduction photocatalyst (RP).Thus, on contact (Fig. 7(b)) the electrons flow from BCN to FeTiO till Fermi levels align and the built-in electric field further restricts the movement of electrons.However, on exposure, as the electron-holes are produced in BCN and FeTiO 2 , the electrons move from CB of FeTiO towards VB of BCN benefitting from internal electric field, band bending (discussed earlier) and Coulomb interactions.The electrons from CB of FeTiO 2 (-0.19 eV) easily recombine with holes in VB of BCN (1.25 eV).However the recombination of electrons from BCN CB and holes from VB of FeTiO 2 is restrained by internal electric field.Thus a Step scheme (S-scheme) is operational here.The charge transfer in the Sscheme mechanism is shown in Fig. 7(c).Thus, the relatively useless photogenerated electrons in CB of FeTiO 2 (-0.19 eV) because they don't have enough energy for generation of The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O was tested under visible light without using any organic sacrificial reagent.Without use of Scheme 1. Possible degradation route of TC. any catalyst no gases were detected.The two major products detected were CH 4 and CO and traces of CH 3 OH.No or non-detectable hydrogen gas was evolved.Fig. 8 (a) and (b) shows the CO 2 conversion efficiency into CH 4 and CO with time respectively.The pristine BCN exhibits very low photocatalytic efficiency with 30.1 mol g -1 CH 4 evolution in 5 h of visible light irradiation.The sample FT30/BCN shows best photocatalytic performance with 123.2 mol g -1 and 10.3 mol g -1 CH 4 and CO evolution respectively.The cumulative CH 4 and CO evolution showing the selectivity of various samples is shown in Fig. 8(c).The CH 4 evolution follows the order: FT30/BCN (24.7 mol g -1 h -1 ) FT40/ BCN (20.4 mol g -1 h -1 ) FT20/BCN (18.4 mol g -1 h -1 ) FT10/BCN (14.2 mol g -1 h -1 ) FeTiO 2 (9.3 mol g -1 h -1 ) BCN (3.6 mol g -1 h -1 ).Comparing the gas evolution rates, it can be seen that FT30/BCN shows highest CH 4 evolution with 91.1 CH 4 selectivity (poor CO evolution 3.6 mol g -1 h -1 ).The average gas evolution, total electrons consumed in reduction and CH 4 selectivity of all samples is listed in Table 1.Comparing with the single catalyst BCN, it is observed that for BCN CO is evolved in higher amounts than CH 4 .However, CH 4 selectivity is higher in FeTiO 2 , though total efficiency is quite low.FT30/ BCN shows highest CH 4 selectivity.Owing to higher recombination rate and poor charge separation, the CO 2 conversion is poor in single semiconductors.However, on formation of heterojunction, dramatic conversion efficiency and CH 4 selectivity is observed.The performance is enhanced owing to following reasons: Firstly the improved quantum efficiency on junction formation, higher charge separation and effective S-scheme transfer mechanism as discussed in earlier sections.Secondly, the BCN nanosheets allow enough CO 2 adsorption and better binding of CO 2 molecules to the metal ions for higher reduction rate as more active sites ensure higher reduction (He et al., 2020).With the higher charge separation facilitated by built-in electric field in the heterojunction, more electrons are produced with time having high redox capability which brings about high CO 2 photoreduction.As seen in Scheme 2, the CH 4 evolution is an 8H /8e -reaction and CO formation is 2H /2e - reaction.Thus kinetically CO formation is favoured, however, CH 4 evolution is thermodynamically favourable.The thermodynamic and kinetic control thus plays important role in the selectivity (Li et al., 2020a). It has been well documented that hydrogen evolution (via water splitting) often competes with and CO 2 reduction (Li et al., 2012).However, non-detectable i. e extremely low yield, H 2 was evolved during the photocatalytic reaction. Firstly, the CO 2 photo-reduction performance was tested under alkali activation i. e using 0.2 M NaOH solution instead of distilled water.Fig. 8(d) shows the CH 4 evolution in 5 h time course under alkali activation.It can be observed that the CH 4 evolution increased to high extent for each catalyst i. e BCN, FeTiO 2 , FT10/BCN and FT30/BCN.For best performing FT30/BCN photocatalyst, under alkali activation, the CH 4 yield gets nearly doubled from 123.2 mol g -1 to 214.5 mol g -1 .The increase in CH 4 evolution is more prominent in heterojunction than in single semiconductors BCN and FeTiO 2 .The increase in the methane yield with alkali activation is attributed to following reasonsthe presence of alkalinity improves the CO 2 solubility and hydroxyl radical formation.The formation of hydroxyl radicals supports the electron-holes separation and favours CO 2 reduction. The photocatalytic performance of FT30/BCN heterojunction was further tested with variation of initial CO 2 /H 2 O feed ratio and keeping rest of parameters same.During the experiment, when CO 2 is passed through water saturator, the quantity of H 2 O vapors carried by CO 2 is dependent on the water vapour pressure.The high temperature favours more water vapors which makes CO 2 more saturated with H 2 O and thus the CO 2 /H 2 O feed ratio will be low.Conversely, low temperature leads to higher CO 2 /H 2 O feed ratio.The temperature of water saturator was maintained at 20, 30 and 40 C. Thus at 10 C, the feed contains highest CO 2 and at 40 C has lowest CO 2 content.Fig. 8(e) shows the effect of CO 2 /H 2 O feed ratio on photo-reduction of CO 2 under visible light with FT30/BCN.The performance order for CH 4 evolution in 5 h is as follows: 123.2 mol g -1 (30 C) 94.5 mol g -1 (40 C) and 70.2 mol g -1 (20 C).At 10 C (high CO 2 /H 2 O feed ratio) the CH 4 yield is lowest.The production rate increased at 30 C and then declined at 40 C further.At higher CO 2 /H 2 O feed ratio, more CO 2 gets attached to the photocatalyst surface and occupies to more active sites as compared to H 2 O molecules.The quantity of H 2 O molecules will thus not be enough to carry out the oxidation and produce lesser H and also lead to higher recombination.So when temperature is increased to higher temperature 40 C (lower CO 2 /H 2 O feed ratio), more of H 2 O molecules gets attached to catalytic sites and would lower the photocatalytic rate.The best performance is achieved at 30 C when appropriate number of H 2 O and CO 2 molecules gets attached to surface resulting in enough oxidation and reduction reactions with diminished recombination rate.In general higher H 2 O content would favour more CH 4 production, but very high content will hamper the photocatalytic reaction rate (Tahir and Tahir, 2020). Further, we investigated the performance of FT30/BCN composite photocatalyst using different reducing agents (H 2 O, methanol and H 2 ) Fig. 7.The S-scheme heterojunction of FeTiO 2 /BCN (a) before contact, (b) after contact, and (c) after contact upon irradiation and charge migration and separation.and light source (visible and solar light) (Fig. 8 f).Under all the experiments CH 4 and CO were the major products.With CO 2 water system, under visible light as discussed earlier higher CH 4 production (123 mol g -1 ) was obtained.With MeOH (methanol) as reducing agent, high yields of CH 4 (160.2mol g -1 ) and CO (18.6 mol g -1 ) were obtained.The CH 4 evolution under CO 2 MeOH was 1.3 times that of CO 2 H 2 O system.No hydrogen was detected.In CO 2 H 2 system also, appreciable quantity of CH 4 and CO were evolved.But the CO evolution was higher as compared to CH 4 with hydrogen as reducing agent which is consistent with earlier findings (Tahir et al., 2020).With methanol due to more protons (H ) production the CH 4 removal was significantly enhanced.Thus reducing agents have a pronounced effect on CO 2 conversion efficiency and CH 4 selectivity.Under solar light CO 2 H 2 O system a high CH 4 evolution 98.7 mol g -1 in 5 h is obtained with high selectivity.Thus, FT30/BCN photocatalyst is capable of efficient solar-to-fuel conversion with high selectivity and promising in real fuel production applications. As discussed earlier, the CH 4 evolution is an 8e -/8H reaction progressed by multiple steps and also via a multiple proton-coupled electron transfer route for high methane selectivity.With the progress of photocatalytic reaction, more photogenerated electrons are produced.Because of an effective S-scheme transfer between FeTiO 2 and BCN a high electron-holes separation is ensured.The FT30/BCN photocatalyst shows high charge transfer capacity, photocurrent response and highly diminished electron-hole recombination.Thus more electrons are available for high and selective CH 4 production.The pzc of the photocatalyst is 7.2 and thus slightly basic characteristics favour more CO 2 adsorption and hydrogenation too.Secondly it can be explained in The average gas evolution rates and CH 4 selectivity for various samples under visible light. Gas evolution (mol g another way that because of presence of RGO basic characteristics are induced on surface of ABR catalyst as pzc is 7.4, CO 2 adsorption and hydrogenation is favoured.The conversion of CO 2 into CO is a more favoured step involving 2H / 2e -mechanism.The S-scheme transfer mechanism which has already been discussed in previous sections saves the electrons and holes in high potential conduction band and valence band respectively.The redox potential for E o (CO/CO 2 ) -0.42eV and E o (CH 4 /CO 2 ) -0.24eV.The electrons accumulated in CB of BCN (-1.2 eV) are capable of for reducing CO 2 to CH 4 by route involving by single step multi electron transfer with proton coupling.The holes accumulated in VB of FeTiO 2 (2.51 eV) have high potential to produce protons from water.Thus the higher charge separation and availability of high potential electrons favour the high conversion efficiency and CH 4 selectivity.Also the short diffusion length of thin exfoliated BCN nanosheets generates more electrons on visible light exposure and favours CH 4 production.As seen in O 1s XPS spectrum in FT30/BCN, there are numerous O vacancies on the surface which trap electrons generated by BCN and FeTiO 2 and boost the photocatalytic activity.Furthermore, isotope experiment with 13 CO 2 and 12 CO 2 were performed for visible light CO 2 H 2 O FT30/BCN system (Figure S5).The existence of peaks at m/z 16 and m/z 17 for CH 4 shows that reduction products are reduced from the CO 2 and not by any other reaction or route. We have also predicted two more mechanisms for high CH 4 selectivity with FT30/BCN catalyst as shown in Fig. 9.It has been reported earlier also that selectivity can be increased via coordination activation.As seen in Ti 2p XPS spectrum, Ti 3 is present on TiO 2 surface and will act as an active site with presence of unpaired electrons.The CO 2 molecules get adsorbed onto photocatalyst via coordination to lewis base site i. e Ti 3 for instance (Sree et al., 2009).As seen in Fig. 9(a), The bridging TiCOO -Ti will be formed on TiO 2 sites located uniformly on thin BCN nanosheets.The adsorbed CO 2 molecules can interact with Ti 3 (as shown in Figure ) via an interfacial charge transfer mechanism thereby decreasing the required activation energy.On exposure to light, the 2 photo-generated electrons will transfer to the co-ordinated CO 2 molecules i. e TiC.Simultaneously, the H (protons) get connected into TiCOO -Ti via electrostatic forces of attraction to form TiHCOO -Ti intermediate as reported in a related previous work (Wang et al., 2021).This intermediate further gets converted into TiHCHO -Ti and TiCH 3 O -Ti which via further protonation and electron transfer (shown in Fig. 9(a)) leads to detachment of CH 4 molecule from catalyst surface.On the other hand, the holes (h ) would generate hydroxyl radicals.This explains the highly selective CH 4 formation.Fig. 9(b) shows the other way for CH 4 formation.The presence of FeTiO 2 facilitates two metal sites on to FT30/BCN heterojunction photcatalyst.Thus, Fe and Ti both can bond concurrently with C and O atoms (in CO 2 -as shown in figure)to form Fe-C-O-Ti i. e M 1 -C-O-M 2 reaction intermediate which favours only CH 4 formation.This is attributed to the fact that it is not easy to break both M 1 -C and M 2 -O bonds simultaneously.On the contrast, it's rather easy to dissociate C-H bonds via continuous protonation which weakens the M 1 -C and M 2 -O bonds simultaneously and produce CH 4 (Jiao et al., 2020). The in-situ XPS characterization, DFT analysis, scavenging experiments probe and band structure analysis predicts an exclusive S-scheme electron transfer mechanism for efficient electron separation and charge transfer capacity for efficient CO 2 reduction. The stability and reusability of the photocatalyst FT30/BCN was tested both for photocatalytic TC degradation and CO 2 reduction.Figure S6 shows that there is no abnormal loss in the activity of FT30/ BCN for TC degradation under visible light.A negligible fall in the TC removal rate was observed.The XRD pattern and SEM micrograph of FT30/BCN (Figure S7) obtained after reuse and recovery shows there is no change the structure and morphology.Thus catalyst is robust, highly stable and recyclable.Further, metal leaching tests were performed for Fe and Ti using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) (Agilent 8800 ICP-QQQ).Figure S8 shows that at pH 2 minor leaching rates were observed for Fe (0.03) and Ti (0.027).The leaching rates are negligible at pH 4.The ultra-low/negligible leaching shows the FT30/BCN photocatalyst is highly stable and does not promote secondary pollution.The catalytic stability of FT30/BCN was further investigated by carrying out the CO 2 reduction under visible light (Figure S9).It can be observed that the high rate of CH 4 evolution is maintained for three cycles i. e 15 h of experiment."}, {"llm generation": "visible light", "source": "With CO 2 water system, under visible light as discussed earlier higher CH 4 production (123 mol g -1 ) was obtained.", "context": "3.1.Characterization Fig. 2 (a) shows the XRD patterns of synthesized photocatalysts.The XRD pattern for BCN shows a peak at 26.7 corresponding to graphitic structure of pristine boron carbon nitride which is well matched with ICDD PDF 53-0447.The peak at 43.1 corresponds to the (111) diffraction planes of BCN in sync with ICDD PDF 51-0768) (Chen et al., 2018).For Fe doped TiO 2 , the diffraction peaks corresponding to (110), ( 101), ( 200), ( 111), ( 210), ( 211), ( 220), ( 002), (311), and ( 112) are observed corresponding to tetragonal rutile TiO 2 which is in good agreement with (JCPDS No. 21-1276) (Wang et al., 2015).A slight shift is observed in 2 values as compared to pure rutile TiO 2 from literature because of doping as there is a difference in ionic radii of Fe and Ti.Fe doped TiO 2 is present in single phase without any trace of clusters of Fe as doping of Fe has been done on Ti sites in TiO 2 matrix.As doping content is less than 5 atomic there is no formation of any secondary phase related to Fe.The XRD patterns of binary junction series as FT/BCN show characteristic peaks of both FeTiO 2 and BCN with no extra phases.The peak intensities for BCN are highly reduced in the heterojunction.Change in intensities is observed which is due to variable content of BCN and FeTiO 2 and also due to the crystallinity differences between the two. The specific surface areas for FeTiO 2 and FT30/BCN were calculated as 32.1 m 2 /g and 74.4 m 2 /g, respectively.The adsorption isotherms (Figure S1) belong to typical type-IV isotherm with H3 type hysteresis loop.The mean pore volume and pore size for FeTiO 2 were 0.14 cm 3 /g, and 21.1 nm, respectively.The pore size and pore volume for FT30/BCN were 16.1 nm and 0.23 cm 3 /g, respectively.The surface area is increased on inclusion of BCN into FeTiO 2 which leads to increase in active sites, promoting the photocatalytic activity.The pore volume increased on inclusion of BCN because of improved dispersity of BCN and FeTiO 2 and the re-creation of pores.It is well known that a large surface area and porous structure favour the enhancement of the photocatalytic property via providing more active sites, accelerating the mass transfer or diffusion.The high surface area improves the photon utilization efficiency by providing more exposure and multiple reflections along the pores. The electronic environment, elemental composition and oxidation states of BCN and FT30/BCN were investigated by XPS analysis (Fig. 3).The survey scan (Figure S2) shows the presence of B, C, N in BCN and Fe, Ti, O, B, C, N in the FT30/BCN composite catalyst.In addition the XPS spectra were also obtained for FT30/BCN photocatalyst after visible light illumination to ascertain the binding energy shifts.Fig. 3(a) shows the B1s spectra for BCN and FT30/BCN.The spectra is deconvoluted into two peaks at 189.4 eV (B1) and 190.1 eV (B2) corresponding to B-C and B-N bonds respectively in BCN (Chang et al., 2013).For FT30/BCN heterojunction, in absence of light irradiation, slightly positive shift in B. E is exhibited compared to bare BCN.This signifies that electrons shift from BCN to FeTiO 2 .After light irradiation, a negative shift in B.E signifies, the electrons transfer from FeTiO 2 towards BCN (Kumar et al., 2020a).These findings are supported by C 1s, Ti 2p and O 1s spectra.(Zhou et al., 2018).The B.E exhibits positive shifts in FT30/BCN without light irradiation and negative shift upon illumination.This confirms the electrons shift from BCN towards FeTiO 2 towards on contact and FeTiO 2 to BCN upon illumination.These observations can be further verified from Ti 2p and O 1s spectra.Fig. 3(c) shows the deconvoluted Ti 2p spectra at 459.4 and 465.3 eV, assigned to Ti 2p 3/2 and Ti 2p 1/2 , respectively for Ti 4 oxidation state in TiO 2 (Li et al., 2020b).The peak at 459.9 eV corresponds to Ti 2p 1/2 for Ti 3 oxidation state.Thus both the oxidation states for Ti exist in the material.The Ti 2p spectra for the junction FT30/BCN shows negative shift in binding energies, confirming the electron shift from BCN to FeTiO 2 .Upon illumination B.E for Ti 2p shifts towards higher side, confirming the electron f low from FeTiO 2 towards BCN. The high-resolution O 1s XPS spectra for FT30/BCN (Fig. 3(d)) show three peaks at 528.5, 529.8 and 530.8 eV corresponding to lattice oxygen (metal-O bond), oxygen vacancies, loosely bound O/adsorbed OH groups respectively (Dhiman et al., 2017).The N 1s spectra (Fig. 3(e)) is deconvoluted into three peaks at 399.9, 401.2 and 402.8 eV which can be assigned to N-B, N-C and N-H bonds respectively (Zhou et al., 2020).The Fe 2p spectrum (Fig. 3(e)) shows two peaks at 715.6 and 729.4 eV corresponding 2p 3/2 and 2p 1/2 oxidation states for Fe 2 oxidation state.The peak positioned at 737.3 eV is assigned to 2p 1/2 for Fe 3 oxidation state.The satellite peak at 721.6 eV confirsm the presence of both Fe 2 and Fe 3 oxidation states.The Ti 3 oxidation state in the catalyst exists due to the generation of oxygen vacancies (OVs reduce the Ti 4 ) (Ye et al., 2021).Comparing the Ti 2p and O 1s spectra in FeTiO2 and FT30/BCN we can observe that there are changes in intensities of Ti as well as O 1s.There are changes in oxygen vacancies in the heterojunction as compared to FeTiO2 which will certainly change the intensity of Ti 3 . The B.E shifts confirm that after the contact between FeTiO 2 and BCN to form the FT/BCN heterojunction, there is electron transfer from BCN to FeTiO 2 .This migration is actually caused by difference in Fermi levels of two semiconductors.As BCN has a higher Fermi level than FeTiO 2 (see DFT calculations discussed later) the difference will drive the migration of electrons from BCN to FeTiO 2 until Fermi levels are aligned (Xia et al., 2020).Thus an internal electric field is created at the semiconductors interface.After illumination the band edge positioning and the internal electric field lead to migration of electrons from FeTiO 2 to BCN by an effective S-scheme transfer.The detailed analysis has been discussed in subsequent sections. The morphology and microstructure of BCN and FT30/BCN was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).Fig. 4(a) shows that exfoliated BCN exhibits lamellar sheets like morphology.The low resolution SEM image of FT30/BCN (Fig. 4 b) shows the spherical FeTiO 2 nanoparticles distributed uniformly over the irregular porous sheet of BCN.The high resolution image further shows that the spherical and uniform FeTiO 2 nanoparticles are in intimate contact with BCN sheets (Fig. 4(c)).Further microstructure was ascertained by TEM analysis.The lamellar nanosheets structure of exfoliated BCN can be observed in Fig. 4(d).The TEM image of FT30/BCN (Fig. 4(e)) confirms the uniform distribution of the spherical FeTiO 2 nanoparticles on to the BCN nanosheets.The high intimate contact between the two is surely beneficial for the electron flow and hence the photocatalytic activity.The HRTEM image (Fig. 4(f)) confirms the intimate contact and crystallinity.The lattice fringes of FeTiO 2 can be seen and the data matches with the XRD findings.However, due to poor crystallinity of BCN, it is difficult to observe the lattice fringes for the same.The presence of distributed Ti, O, Fe, B, C and N elements in FT30/BCN is shown in the SEM elemental mapping and corresponding elemental distribution (Fig. 4 g-m).This further demonstrates the close interfacial contact of two components and successful formation of the binary heterojunction. The light absorption properties of BCN, FeTiO 2 and FT30/BCN were characterized by the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-vis DRS) shown in Fig. 5(a).The BCN obviously absorbs in the visible range with absorption edge near 580 nm TiO 2 has a higher band gap with absorption in UV region.However, with 1.5 Fe doping, the absorption edge shows red shift with a better absorption in visible region.The heterojunction FT30/BCN shows a high absorption edge as compared to FeTiO 2 because oof inclusion of low band gap BCN.The increased optical harvesting improves quantum efficiency and photoredox catalysis.The band gap energy (E g ) was caluclated using Kubelka-Munk function (Kumar et al., 2020c).Therefore, the E g values for FeTiO 2 and BCN were estimated to be 2.70 and 2.45 eV, respectively (Fig. 5(b)). The band gap energy for FT30/BCN heterojunction (Figure S3) was found to be 2.57 eV.Further, Mott-Schottky function was utilized to estimate flat band potential (V FB ) as shown in Fig. 5(c-d).The V FB for BCN and FeTiO 2 are found to be 0.1 V and -1.0 V vs NHE respectively. The conduction band edge (E CB ) for an n-type semiconductor (as can be seen in M -S plots that both semiconductors are n-type) is generally 0.1-0.2eV (vs NHE) below the flat band energy (Kumar et al., 2020a). Considering the difference as 0.2 eV, the CB edges are calculated as -1.2 eV and -0.19 eV vs NHE for BCN and FeTiO 2 respectively.Finally, the VB edges (E VB ) were found to be 1.25 eV and 2.51 eV vs NHE for BCN and FeTiO 2 respectively.Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) derived Nyquist plots for BCN, FeTiO 2 and FT30/BCN are shown in Fig. 5(e).Evidently, FT30/BCN exhibits smallest arc radius as compared to bare semiconductors inferring that the heterojunction has lowest charge transfer resistance or highest transfer capacity.The photo-current density (Fig. 5 (f)) of FT30/BCN is significantly enhanced on the junction formation between FeTiO 2 and BCN which is consistent with EIS findings.The high photocurrent response (PCR) of the junction is attributed to higher visible absorption, high charge transfer capacity, reduced recombination and electron aggregation.This was further supported by photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy findings (Fig. 5(g)).The PL intensity falls dramatically in the heterojunction, suggesting that electron-hole recombination is highly diminished.Interestingly, the charge separation improves with increase in content of FeTiO 2 in BCN i. e from FT10/BCN to FT30/BCN.In addition, to elucidate the photo-induced electrons transfer direction and mechanism active at the FeTiO 2 and BCN interface, DFT calculations were employed.The DFT calculation was used to measure the electron density difference between the semiconductors.Fig. 5 (h) shows that FeTiO 2 is a typical oxidation photocatalyst (OP) with a large work function of 6.70 eV.On the other hand, BCN has a lower work function (3.51 eV) (Fig. 5(i)) and is a reduction photocatalyst (RP) quite similar to carbon nitride (Fu et al., 2019).Generally, the Fermi level position is inversely related to the work function.Fig. 9(a-c) shows the electron transfer mechanism in FT/BCN heterojunction.Thus, the Fermi level of BCN is higher than FeTiO 2 Before contact, the CB and VB positioning of FeTiO 2 and BCN shows that they form a staggered arrangement.After contact, the electrons spontaneously migrate from BCN towards FeTiO 2 across their interface until Fermi levels reach equilibrium.The electron output from BCN results in the bending of CB edge upwards.On the contrary, the band edge of FeTiO 2 gets bent downwards because of accumulation of electrons.Hence an internal electric field is set-up.The movement of electrons from BCN leads to formation of internal electric field which further prevents the further migration from BCN to FeTiO 2. On illumination, the electrons and holes get excited in both the semiconductors and the electrons from CB of FeTiO 2 gets migrated to VB of BCN and recombine with holes.This is facilitated by internal electric field and Coulomb interaction.These facts are supported by B.E shifts in XPS findings.The detailed mechanism is discussed in subsequent directions. Systematic tetracycline (TC) photocatalytic degradation experiments were conducted under visible light irradiation using 300 W Xe lamp (with visible light filter).Considering, the adsorption equilibrium, the stirring was performed under dark conditions for 30 min.Figure S4 shows that FT30/BCN shows 87.1 TC removal in 90 min with 31.2 adsorption in dark in 30 min.From 22.1 to 31.1 there is no substantial improvement in adsorption potential as we move from BCN to FT30/ BCN.However, FT30/BCN shows highest adsorption capacity because of high surface area and active sites as also supported by BET adsorption isotherms results.Secondly, under direct exposure, better performance was recorded as can be seen in Fig. 6(a).As shown, after 60 min visible light treatment, the TC removal rates of 45.1, 52.3, 70.1, 85.4, 93.1 and 96.2 were obtained in presence of BCN, FeTiO 2 , FT10/ BCN, FT20/BCN, FT40/BCN and FT30/BCN respectively.There is a substantial improvement in the TC removal rate for FT30/BCN as compared to bare BCN and FeTiO 2 which is due to higher visible capture capacity, reduced recombination and high charge transfer capacity on formation of heterojunction.With increase in content of FeTiO 2 in BCN, the TC degradation increases dramatically, but with very high content i. e 40FeTiO 2 the TC removal decreased.This is attributed to the fact that excess of FeTiO 2 not only hinders the interfacial contact, but also redundant material acts as recombination centres ().The high performance of FT30/BCN is supported by observations from UV-DRS, EIS, PCR and PL measurements.The pseudo-firstorder kinetic analysis for TC degradation is revealed in Fig. 6(b).The plots show that reaction rate for FT30/BCN (k app 0.7123 min -1 ) is nearly 7 times that of bare BCN (0.01246 min -1 ). During the photocatalytic process, pH, presence of electrolytes, water matrix and light source tend to affect the catalyst performance via controlling the surface charge distribution and production of active oxygen species.Fig. 6(c) shows that initial pH has a pronounced effect on the TC degradation by FT30/BCN under visible light.The highest TC removal was found to be 96.2 at pH 5.4 and this was chosen as optimized pH for all the experiments.TC possesses three different pKa values, i. e 3.30, 7.7 and 9.7 (Yi et al., 2020).The pH, pKa and pzc of the catalyst govern the interactions with the TC molecules and also control the strength of hydroxyl and superoxide radical anions in the system.The drug exists as (i) H 4 TC at pH 3.3, (ii) H 3 TC in the pH 3.3-7.7,(iii) H 2 TC -in the pH 7.7-9.7 and (iv) HTC 2-at pH 12.The higher degradation at pH 5.5 could be attributed to the attractive electrostatic force between H 3 TC and FT30/BCN (pzc 7.2).Highly acidic medium limits the adsorption due to repulsive forces and similar behaviour is expected at very high pH.Also, the alkaline medium leads to quenching of OH radicals (Kumar et al., 2020a). Further, effect of some common cations and anions onto TC removal with FT30/BCN catalyst was studied and results are shown in Fig. 6(d).Evidently it can be seen that Cl -and Na ions have no noticeable effect on the photocatalytic efficiency.It's worth mentioning that NO 3 -ions promote in the TC photodegradation (k app 0.07622 min -1 ).This is attributed to the fact that NO 3 -forms excited state on visible light irradiation to form NO 2 and OH which accelerates the TC degradation. On the other hand, HCO 3 -ions have an detrimental effect on TC removal (k app 0.06061 min -1 ) because they consume OH radicals to produce CO 3 -radicals.These radicals are less reactive than hydroxyl radicals and thus the degradation rate falls.The degree of inhibition is higher in case of SO 4 2-ions because they are effective radical scavengers (Tang et al., 2020b).However, Mg 2 showed little inhibitory effect, which may be attributed decrease of pH value and Ca 2 cause inhibition in TC removal because they tend to form co-ordination complexes with the drug molecule (Liu et al., 2020) and similar observations have been found in our previous works too (Kumar et al., 2020a).It is well known that Ca 2 ions form 1:2 ligand:metal complex with TC via chelation (Wessels et al., 1998).As it was observed that inorganic ions have a significant on the TC removal rate, we tested the degradation efficiency in real water system i. e river water, tap water and municipal water (Fig. 6(e)).The water quality parameters are listed in table S1.The TC removal efficiency of 96.2, 93.4, 92.3 and 94.1 in distilled water (DW), Municipal drinking water (MW), tap water (TW) and river water (RW) respectively.Definitely, presence of various ions, natural organic matter etc. leads to variation in the performance in various water matrices.However, it is clearly inferred that FT30/BCN heterojunction has a high potential in practical purification of waste water.Further, the TC degradation efficiency and total organic carbon (TOC) with FT30/BCN catalyst was tested under visible and solar light (Fig. 6(f)).Under natural solar light, 84.1 and 81.2 TC was removed in 60 min in DW and RW respectively.A high mineralization was also reported with 77.2 and 64.3 TOC removal in 2 h under visible and solar light in distilled water.A high TC degradation and TOC removal in river water both under visible light and solar light.This again establishes the findings that FT30/BCN heterojunction has a promising future in real waste water treatment. Radical scavenging experiments were performed to assess the role of reactive oxygen species involved in TC degradation under visible light.Fig. 6(g) shows the effect of 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1oxyl (TEMPOL), isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) as scavengers for et al., 2021).P7 with m/z 384 stemmed from the C-N bond cleavage from P6. P5 with m/z 396 was the by-product of TC methylation.P4 is decomposed into P6 (m/z 413) through the ring-opening process.P6 is continuously oxidized and decomposed to P8 (m/z 256) (ring break and removal of -COOH and -OH groups) and P9 (m/z 218).Further oxidations and decomposition via ring opening leads to formation of simpler moieties with m/Z 159 and 102 (Derikvandi et al., 2021).The intermediates are consistent with reported findings (Tang et al., 2020b).Further oxidation leads to formation of simpler aliphatic molecules and mineralized in longer run into inorganic compounds and gases as supported by high TOC removal findings. A suitable photocatalytic mechanism was predicted on basis of XPS, scavenging experiments, DFT calculations and ESR findings.The ESR DMPO- O 2 -spectrum (Fig. 6(h)) shows high intensity peaks (1:1:1:1) under visible light and no peaks in dark.This suggests that O 2 -radicals are major active species responsible for TC degradation and are present in higher concentration.Also, the DMPO- OH spectrum shows low intensity spectra (1:2:2:1) suggesting a little role of OH radicals in the degradation reaction.These results are supported by scavenging experiments.The thermodynamic feasibility of radical generation can be understood by analysing the band structure.As discussed earlier, from DFT calculations it was found that FeTiO 2 with a higher work function and low fermi level is a typical Oxidation type photocatalyst (OP).On the contrast, BCN has a lower work function with high Fermi level as for a typical reduction photocatalyst (RP).Thus, on contact (Fig. 7(b)) the electrons flow from BCN to FeTiO till Fermi levels align and the built-in electric field further restricts the movement of electrons.However, on exposure, as the electron-holes are produced in BCN and FeTiO 2 , the electrons move from CB of FeTiO towards VB of BCN benefitting from internal electric field, band bending (discussed earlier) and Coulomb interactions.The electrons from CB of FeTiO 2 (-0.19 eV) easily recombine with holes in VB of BCN (1.25 eV).However the recombination of electrons from BCN CB and holes from VB of FeTiO 2 is restrained by internal electric field.Thus a Step scheme (S-scheme) is operational here.The charge transfer in the Sscheme mechanism is shown in Fig. 7(c).Thus, the relatively useless photogenerated electrons in CB of FeTiO 2 (-0.19 eV) because they don't have enough energy for generation of The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O was tested under visible light without using any organic sacrificial reagent.Without use of Scheme 1. Possible degradation route of TC. any catalyst no gases were detected.The two major products detected were CH 4 and CO and traces of CH 3 OH.No or non-detectable hydrogen gas was evolved.Fig. 8 (a) and (b) shows the CO 2 conversion efficiency into CH 4 and CO with time respectively.The pristine BCN exhibits very low photocatalytic efficiency with 30.1 mol g -1 CH 4 evolution in 5 h of visible light irradiation.The sample FT30/BCN shows best photocatalytic performance with 123.2 mol g -1 and 10.3 mol g -1 CH 4 and CO evolution respectively.The cumulative CH 4 and CO evolution showing the selectivity of various samples is shown in Fig. 8(c).The CH 4 evolution follows the order: FT30/BCN (24.7 mol g -1 h -1 ) FT40/ BCN (20.4 mol g -1 h -1 ) FT20/BCN (18.4 mol g -1 h -1 ) FT10/BCN (14.2 mol g -1 h -1 ) FeTiO 2 (9.3 mol g -1 h -1 ) BCN (3.6 mol g -1 h -1 ).Comparing the gas evolution rates, it can be seen that FT30/BCN shows highest CH 4 evolution with 91.1 CH 4 selectivity (poor CO evolution 3.6 mol g -1 h -1 ).The average gas evolution, total electrons consumed in reduction and CH 4 selectivity of all samples is listed in Table 1.Comparing with the single catalyst BCN, it is observed that for BCN CO is evolved in higher amounts than CH 4 .However, CH 4 selectivity is higher in FeTiO 2 , though total efficiency is quite low.FT30/ BCN shows highest CH 4 selectivity.Owing to higher recombination rate and poor charge separation, the CO 2 conversion is poor in single semiconductors.However, on formation of heterojunction, dramatic conversion efficiency and CH 4 selectivity is observed.The performance is enhanced owing to following reasons: Firstly the improved quantum efficiency on junction formation, higher charge separation and effective S-scheme transfer mechanism as discussed in earlier sections.Secondly, the BCN nanosheets allow enough CO 2 adsorption and better binding of CO 2 molecules to the metal ions for higher reduction rate as more active sites ensure higher reduction (He et al., 2020).With the higher charge separation facilitated by built-in electric field in the heterojunction, more electrons are produced with time having high redox capability which brings about high CO 2 photoreduction.As seen in Scheme 2, the CH 4 evolution is an 8H /8e -reaction and CO formation is 2H /2e - reaction.Thus kinetically CO formation is favoured, however, CH 4 evolution is thermodynamically favourable.The thermodynamic and kinetic control thus plays important role in the selectivity (Li et al., 2020a). It has been well documented that hydrogen evolution (via water splitting) often competes with and CO 2 reduction (Li et al., 2012).However, non-detectable i. e extremely low yield, H 2 was evolved during the photocatalytic reaction. Firstly, the CO 2 photo-reduction performance was tested under alkali activation i. e using 0.2 M NaOH solution instead of distilled water.Fig. 8(d) shows the CH 4 evolution in 5 h time course under alkali activation.It can be observed that the CH 4 evolution increased to high extent for each catalyst i. e BCN, FeTiO 2 , FT10/BCN and FT30/BCN.For best performing FT30/BCN photocatalyst, under alkali activation, the CH 4 yield gets nearly doubled from 123.2 mol g -1 to 214.5 mol g -1 .The increase in CH 4 evolution is more prominent in heterojunction than in single semiconductors BCN and FeTiO 2 .The increase in the methane yield with alkali activation is attributed to following reasonsthe presence of alkalinity improves the CO 2 solubility and hydroxyl radical formation.The formation of hydroxyl radicals supports the electron-holes separation and favours CO 2 reduction. The photocatalytic performance of FT30/BCN heterojunction was further tested with variation of initial CO 2 /H 2 O feed ratio and keeping rest of parameters same.During the experiment, when CO 2 is passed through water saturator, the quantity of H 2 O vapors carried by CO 2 is dependent on the water vapour pressure.The high temperature favours more water vapors which makes CO 2 more saturated with H 2 O and thus the CO 2 /H 2 O feed ratio will be low.Conversely, low temperature leads to higher CO 2 /H 2 O feed ratio.The temperature of water saturator was maintained at 20, 30 and 40 C. Thus at 10 C, the feed contains highest CO 2 and at 40 C has lowest CO 2 content.Fig. 8(e) shows the effect of CO 2 /H 2 O feed ratio on photo-reduction of CO 2 under visible light with FT30/BCN.The performance order for CH 4 evolution in 5 h is as follows: 123.2 mol g -1 (30 C) 94.5 mol g -1 (40 C) and 70.2 mol g -1 (20 C).At 10 C (high CO 2 /H 2 O feed ratio) the CH 4 yield is lowest.The production rate increased at 30 C and then declined at 40 C further.At higher CO 2 /H 2 O feed ratio, more CO 2 gets attached to the photocatalyst surface and occupies to more active sites as compared to H 2 O molecules.The quantity of H 2 O molecules will thus not be enough to carry out the oxidation and produce lesser H and also lead to higher recombination.So when temperature is increased to higher temperature 40 C (lower CO 2 /H 2 O feed ratio), more of H 2 O molecules gets attached to catalytic sites and would lower the photocatalytic rate.The best performance is achieved at 30 C when appropriate number of H 2 O and CO 2 molecules gets attached to surface resulting in enough oxidation and reduction reactions with diminished recombination rate.In general higher H 2 O content would favour more CH 4 production, but very high content will hamper the photocatalytic reaction rate (Tahir and Tahir, 2020). Further, we investigated the performance of FT30/BCN composite photocatalyst using different reducing agents (H 2 O, methanol and H 2 ) Fig. 7.The S-scheme heterojunction of FeTiO 2 /BCN (a) before contact, (b) after contact, and (c) after contact upon irradiation and charge migration and separation.and light source (visible and solar light) (Fig. 8 f).Under all the experiments CH 4 and CO were the major products.With CO 2 water system, under visible light as discussed earlier higher CH 4 production (123 mol g -1 ) was obtained.With MeOH (methanol) as reducing agent, high yields of CH 4 (160.2mol g -1 ) and CO (18.6 mol g -1 ) were obtained.The CH 4 evolution under CO 2 MeOH was 1.3 times that of CO 2 H 2 O system.No hydrogen was detected.In CO 2 H 2 system also, appreciable quantity of CH 4 and CO were evolved.But the CO evolution was higher as compared to CH 4 with hydrogen as reducing agent which is consistent with earlier findings (Tahir et al., 2020).With methanol due to more protons (H ) production the CH 4 removal was significantly enhanced.Thus reducing agents have a pronounced effect on CO 2 conversion efficiency and CH 4 selectivity.Under solar light CO 2 H 2 O system a high CH 4 evolution 98.7 mol g -1 in 5 h is obtained with high selectivity.Thus, FT30/BCN photocatalyst is capable of efficient solar-to-fuel conversion with high selectivity and promising in real fuel production applications. As discussed earlier, the CH 4 evolution is an 8e -/8H reaction progressed by multiple steps and also via a multiple proton-coupled electron transfer route for high methane selectivity.With the progress of photocatalytic reaction, more photogenerated electrons are produced.Because of an effective S-scheme transfer between FeTiO 2 and BCN a high electron-holes separation is ensured.The FT30/BCN photocatalyst shows high charge transfer capacity, photocurrent response and highly diminished electron-hole recombination.Thus more electrons are available for high and selective CH 4 production.The pzc of the photocatalyst is 7.2 and thus slightly basic characteristics favour more CO 2 adsorption and hydrogenation too.Secondly it can be explained in The average gas evolution rates and CH 4 selectivity for various samples under visible light. Gas evolution (mol g another way that because of presence of RGO basic characteristics are induced on surface of ABR catalyst as pzc is 7.4, CO 2 adsorption and hydrogenation is favoured.The conversion of CO 2 into CO is a more favoured step involving 2H / 2e -mechanism.The S-scheme transfer mechanism which has already been discussed in previous sections saves the electrons and holes in high potential conduction band and valence band respectively.The redox potential for E o (CO/CO 2 ) -0.42eV and E o (CH 4 /CO 2 ) -0.24eV.The electrons accumulated in CB of BCN (-1.2 eV) are capable of for reducing CO 2 to CH 4 by route involving by single step multi electron transfer with proton coupling.The holes accumulated in VB of FeTiO 2 (2.51 eV) have high potential to produce protons from water.Thus the higher charge separation and availability of high potential electrons favour the high conversion efficiency and CH 4 selectivity.Also the short diffusion length of thin exfoliated BCN nanosheets generates more electrons on visible light exposure and favours CH 4 production.As seen in O 1s XPS spectrum in FT30/BCN, there are numerous O vacancies on the surface which trap electrons generated by BCN and FeTiO 2 and boost the photocatalytic activity.Furthermore, isotope experiment with 13 CO 2 and 12 CO 2 were performed for visible light CO 2 H 2 O FT30/BCN system (Figure S5).The existence of peaks at m/z 16 and m/z 17 for CH 4 shows that reduction products are reduced from the CO 2 and not by any other reaction or route. We have also predicted two more mechanisms for high CH 4 selectivity with FT30/BCN catalyst as shown in Fig. 9.It has been reported earlier also that selectivity can be increased via coordination activation.As seen in Ti 2p XPS spectrum, Ti 3 is present on TiO 2 surface and will act as an active site with presence of unpaired electrons.The CO 2 molecules get adsorbed onto photocatalyst via coordination to lewis base site i. e Ti 3 for instance (Sree et al., 2009).As seen in Fig. 9(a), The bridging TiCOO -Ti will be formed on TiO 2 sites located uniformly on thin BCN nanosheets.The adsorbed CO 2 molecules can interact with Ti 3 (as shown in Figure ) via an interfacial charge transfer mechanism thereby decreasing the required activation energy.On exposure to light, the 2 photo-generated electrons will transfer to the co-ordinated CO 2 molecules i. e TiC.Simultaneously, the H (protons) get connected into TiCOO -Ti via electrostatic forces of attraction to form TiHCOO -Ti intermediate as reported in a related previous work (Wang et al., 2021).This intermediate further gets converted into TiHCHO -Ti and TiCH 3 O -Ti which via further protonation and electron transfer (shown in Fig. 9(a)) leads to detachment of CH 4 molecule from catalyst surface.On the other hand, the holes (h ) would generate hydroxyl radicals.This explains the highly selective CH 4 formation.Fig. 9(b) shows the other way for CH 4 formation.The presence of FeTiO 2 facilitates two metal sites on to FT30/BCN heterojunction photcatalyst.Thus, Fe and Ti both can bond concurrently with C and O atoms (in CO 2 -as shown in figure)to form Fe-C-O-Ti i. e M 1 -C-O-M 2 reaction intermediate which favours only CH 4 formation.This is attributed to the fact that it is not easy to break both M 1 -C and M 2 -O bonds simultaneously.On the contrast, it's rather easy to dissociate C-H bonds via continuous protonation which weakens the M 1 -C and M 2 -O bonds simultaneously and produce CH 4 (Jiao et al., 2020). The in-situ XPS characterization, DFT analysis, scavenging experiments probe and band structure analysis predicts an exclusive S-scheme electron transfer mechanism for efficient electron separation and charge transfer capacity for efficient CO 2 reduction. The stability and reusability of the photocatalyst FT30/BCN was tested both for photocatalytic TC degradation and CO 2 reduction.Figure S6 shows that there is no abnormal loss in the activity of FT30/ BCN for TC degradation under visible light.A negligible fall in the TC removal rate was observed.The XRD pattern and SEM micrograph of FT30/BCN (Figure S7) obtained after reuse and recovery shows there is no change the structure and morphology.Thus catalyst is robust, highly stable and recyclable.Further, metal leaching tests were performed for Fe and Ti using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) (Agilent 8800 ICP-QQQ).Figure S8 shows that at pH 2 minor leaching rates were observed for Fe (0.03) and Ti (0.027).The leaching rates are negligible at pH 4.The ultra-low/negligible leaching shows the FT30/BCN photocatalyst is highly stable and does not promote secondary pollution.The catalytic stability of FT30/BCN was further investigated by carrying out the CO 2 reduction under visible light (Figure S9).It can be observed that the high rate of CH 4 evolution is maintained for three cycles i. e 15 h of experiment."}, {"llm generation": "visible light", "source": "The catalytic stability of FT30/BCN was further investigated by carrying out the CO 2 reduction under visible light (Figure S9).", "context": "3.1.Characterization Fig. 2 (a) shows the XRD patterns of synthesized photocatalysts.The XRD pattern for BCN shows a peak at 26.7 corresponding to graphitic structure of pristine boron carbon nitride which is well matched with ICDD PDF 53-0447.The peak at 43.1 corresponds to the (111) diffraction planes of BCN in sync with ICDD PDF 51-0768) (Chen et al., 2018).For Fe doped TiO 2 , the diffraction peaks corresponding to (110), ( 101), ( 200), ( 111), ( 210), ( 211), ( 220), ( 002), (311), and ( 112) are observed corresponding to tetragonal rutile TiO 2 which is in good agreement with (JCPDS No. 21-1276) (Wang et al., 2015).A slight shift is observed in 2 values as compared to pure rutile TiO 2 from literature because of doping as there is a difference in ionic radii of Fe and Ti.Fe doped TiO 2 is present in single phase without any trace of clusters of Fe as doping of Fe has been done on Ti sites in TiO 2 matrix.As doping content is less than 5 atomic there is no formation of any secondary phase related to Fe.The XRD patterns of binary junction series as FT/BCN show characteristic peaks of both FeTiO 2 and BCN with no extra phases.The peak intensities for BCN are highly reduced in the heterojunction.Change in intensities is observed which is due to variable content of BCN and FeTiO 2 and also due to the crystallinity differences between the two. The specific surface areas for FeTiO 2 and FT30/BCN were calculated as 32.1 m 2 /g and 74.4 m 2 /g, respectively.The adsorption isotherms (Figure S1) belong to typical type-IV isotherm with H3 type hysteresis loop.The mean pore volume and pore size for FeTiO 2 were 0.14 cm 3 /g, and 21.1 nm, respectively.The pore size and pore volume for FT30/BCN were 16.1 nm and 0.23 cm 3 /g, respectively.The surface area is increased on inclusion of BCN into FeTiO 2 which leads to increase in active sites, promoting the photocatalytic activity.The pore volume increased on inclusion of BCN because of improved dispersity of BCN and FeTiO 2 and the re-creation of pores.It is well known that a large surface area and porous structure favour the enhancement of the photocatalytic property via providing more active sites, accelerating the mass transfer or diffusion.The high surface area improves the photon utilization efficiency by providing more exposure and multiple reflections along the pores. The electronic environment, elemental composition and oxidation states of BCN and FT30/BCN were investigated by XPS analysis (Fig. 3).The survey scan (Figure S2) shows the presence of B, C, N in BCN and Fe, Ti, O, B, C, N in the FT30/BCN composite catalyst.In addition the XPS spectra were also obtained for FT30/BCN photocatalyst after visible light illumination to ascertain the binding energy shifts.Fig. 3(a) shows the B1s spectra for BCN and FT30/BCN.The spectra is deconvoluted into two peaks at 189.4 eV (B1) and 190.1 eV (B2) corresponding to B-C and B-N bonds respectively in BCN (Chang et al., 2013).For FT30/BCN heterojunction, in absence of light irradiation, slightly positive shift in B. E is exhibited compared to bare BCN.This signifies that electrons shift from BCN to FeTiO 2 .After light irradiation, a negative shift in B.E signifies, the electrons transfer from FeTiO 2 towards BCN (Kumar et al., 2020a).These findings are supported by C 1s, Ti 2p and O 1s spectra.(Zhou et al., 2018).The B.E exhibits positive shifts in FT30/BCN without light irradiation and negative shift upon illumination.This confirms the electrons shift from BCN towards FeTiO 2 towards on contact and FeTiO 2 to BCN upon illumination.These observations can be further verified from Ti 2p and O 1s spectra.Fig. 3(c) shows the deconvoluted Ti 2p spectra at 459.4 and 465.3 eV, assigned to Ti 2p 3/2 and Ti 2p 1/2 , respectively for Ti 4 oxidation state in TiO 2 (Li et al., 2020b).The peak at 459.9 eV corresponds to Ti 2p 1/2 for Ti 3 oxidation state.Thus both the oxidation states for Ti exist in the material.The Ti 2p spectra for the junction FT30/BCN shows negative shift in binding energies, confirming the electron shift from BCN to FeTiO 2 .Upon illumination B.E for Ti 2p shifts towards higher side, confirming the electron f low from FeTiO 2 towards BCN. The high-resolution O 1s XPS spectra for FT30/BCN (Fig. 3(d)) show three peaks at 528.5, 529.8 and 530.8 eV corresponding to lattice oxygen (metal-O bond), oxygen vacancies, loosely bound O/adsorbed OH groups respectively (Dhiman et al., 2017).The N 1s spectra (Fig. 3(e)) is deconvoluted into three peaks at 399.9, 401.2 and 402.8 eV which can be assigned to N-B, N-C and N-H bonds respectively (Zhou et al., 2020).The Fe 2p spectrum (Fig. 3(e)) shows two peaks at 715.6 and 729.4 eV corresponding 2p 3/2 and 2p 1/2 oxidation states for Fe 2 oxidation state.The peak positioned at 737.3 eV is assigned to 2p 1/2 for Fe 3 oxidation state.The satellite peak at 721.6 eV confirsm the presence of both Fe 2 and Fe 3 oxidation states.The Ti 3 oxidation state in the catalyst exists due to the generation of oxygen vacancies (OVs reduce the Ti 4 ) (Ye et al., 2021).Comparing the Ti 2p and O 1s spectra in FeTiO2 and FT30/BCN we can observe that there are changes in intensities of Ti as well as O 1s.There are changes in oxygen vacancies in the heterojunction as compared to FeTiO2 which will certainly change the intensity of Ti 3 . The B.E shifts confirm that after the contact between FeTiO 2 and BCN to form the FT/BCN heterojunction, there is electron transfer from BCN to FeTiO 2 .This migration is actually caused by difference in Fermi levels of two semiconductors.As BCN has a higher Fermi level than FeTiO 2 (see DFT calculations discussed later) the difference will drive the migration of electrons from BCN to FeTiO 2 until Fermi levels are aligned (Xia et al., 2020).Thus an internal electric field is created at the semiconductors interface.After illumination the band edge positioning and the internal electric field lead to migration of electrons from FeTiO 2 to BCN by an effective S-scheme transfer.The detailed analysis has been discussed in subsequent sections. The morphology and microstructure of BCN and FT30/BCN was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).Fig. 4(a) shows that exfoliated BCN exhibits lamellar sheets like morphology.The low resolution SEM image of FT30/BCN (Fig. 4 b) shows the spherical FeTiO 2 nanoparticles distributed uniformly over the irregular porous sheet of BCN.The high resolution image further shows that the spherical and uniform FeTiO 2 nanoparticles are in intimate contact with BCN sheets (Fig. 4(c)).Further microstructure was ascertained by TEM analysis.The lamellar nanosheets structure of exfoliated BCN can be observed in Fig. 4(d).The TEM image of FT30/BCN (Fig. 4(e)) confirms the uniform distribution of the spherical FeTiO 2 nanoparticles on to the BCN nanosheets.The high intimate contact between the two is surely beneficial for the electron flow and hence the photocatalytic activity.The HRTEM image (Fig. 4(f)) confirms the intimate contact and crystallinity.The lattice fringes of FeTiO 2 can be seen and the data matches with the XRD findings.However, due to poor crystallinity of BCN, it is difficult to observe the lattice fringes for the same.The presence of distributed Ti, O, Fe, B, C and N elements in FT30/BCN is shown in the SEM elemental mapping and corresponding elemental distribution (Fig. 4 g-m).This further demonstrates the close interfacial contact of two components and successful formation of the binary heterojunction. The light absorption properties of BCN, FeTiO 2 and FT30/BCN were characterized by the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-vis DRS) shown in Fig. 5(a).The BCN obviously absorbs in the visible range with absorption edge near 580 nm TiO 2 has a higher band gap with absorption in UV region.However, with 1.5 Fe doping, the absorption edge shows red shift with a better absorption in visible region.The heterojunction FT30/BCN shows a high absorption edge as compared to FeTiO 2 because oof inclusion of low band gap BCN.The increased optical harvesting improves quantum efficiency and photoredox catalysis.The band gap energy (E g ) was caluclated using Kubelka-Munk function (Kumar et al., 2020c).Therefore, the E g values for FeTiO 2 and BCN were estimated to be 2.70 and 2.45 eV, respectively (Fig. 5(b)). The band gap energy for FT30/BCN heterojunction (Figure S3) was found to be 2.57 eV.Further, Mott-Schottky function was utilized to estimate flat band potential (V FB ) as shown in Fig. 5(c-d).The V FB for BCN and FeTiO 2 are found to be 0.1 V and -1.0 V vs NHE respectively. The conduction band edge (E CB ) for an n-type semiconductor (as can be seen in M -S plots that both semiconductors are n-type) is generally 0.1-0.2eV (vs NHE) below the flat band energy (Kumar et al., 2020a). Considering the difference as 0.2 eV, the CB edges are calculated as -1.2 eV and -0.19 eV vs NHE for BCN and FeTiO 2 respectively.Finally, the VB edges (E VB ) were found to be 1.25 eV and 2.51 eV vs NHE for BCN and FeTiO 2 respectively.Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) derived Nyquist plots for BCN, FeTiO 2 and FT30/BCN are shown in Fig. 5(e).Evidently, FT30/BCN exhibits smallest arc radius as compared to bare semiconductors inferring that the heterojunction has lowest charge transfer resistance or highest transfer capacity.The photo-current density (Fig. 5 (f)) of FT30/BCN is significantly enhanced on the junction formation between FeTiO 2 and BCN which is consistent with EIS findings.The high photocurrent response (PCR) of the junction is attributed to higher visible absorption, high charge transfer capacity, reduced recombination and electron aggregation.This was further supported by photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy findings (Fig. 5(g)).The PL intensity falls dramatically in the heterojunction, suggesting that electron-hole recombination is highly diminished.Interestingly, the charge separation improves with increase in content of FeTiO 2 in BCN i. e from FT10/BCN to FT30/BCN.In addition, to elucidate the photo-induced electrons transfer direction and mechanism active at the FeTiO 2 and BCN interface, DFT calculations were employed.The DFT calculation was used to measure the electron density difference between the semiconductors.Fig. 5 (h) shows that FeTiO 2 is a typical oxidation photocatalyst (OP) with a large work function of 6.70 eV.On the other hand, BCN has a lower work function (3.51 eV) (Fig. 5(i)) and is a reduction photocatalyst (RP) quite similar to carbon nitride (Fu et al., 2019).Generally, the Fermi level position is inversely related to the work function.Fig. 9(a-c) shows the electron transfer mechanism in FT/BCN heterojunction.Thus, the Fermi level of BCN is higher than FeTiO 2 Before contact, the CB and VB positioning of FeTiO 2 and BCN shows that they form a staggered arrangement.After contact, the electrons spontaneously migrate from BCN towards FeTiO 2 across their interface until Fermi levels reach equilibrium.The electron output from BCN results in the bending of CB edge upwards.On the contrary, the band edge of FeTiO 2 gets bent downwards because of accumulation of electrons.Hence an internal electric field is set-up.The movement of electrons from BCN leads to formation of internal electric field which further prevents the further migration from BCN to FeTiO 2. On illumination, the electrons and holes get excited in both the semiconductors and the electrons from CB of FeTiO 2 gets migrated to VB of BCN and recombine with holes.This is facilitated by internal electric field and Coulomb interaction.These facts are supported by B.E shifts in XPS findings.The detailed mechanism is discussed in subsequent directions. Systematic tetracycline (TC) photocatalytic degradation experiments were conducted under visible light irradiation using 300 W Xe lamp (with visible light filter).Considering, the adsorption equilibrium, the stirring was performed under dark conditions for 30 min.Figure S4 shows that FT30/BCN shows 87.1 TC removal in 90 min with 31.2 adsorption in dark in 30 min.From 22.1 to 31.1 there is no substantial improvement in adsorption potential as we move from BCN to FT30/ BCN.However, FT30/BCN shows highest adsorption capacity because of high surface area and active sites as also supported by BET adsorption isotherms results.Secondly, under direct exposure, better performance was recorded as can be seen in Fig. 6(a).As shown, after 60 min visible light treatment, the TC removal rates of 45.1, 52.3, 70.1, 85.4, 93.1 and 96.2 were obtained in presence of BCN, FeTiO 2 , FT10/ BCN, FT20/BCN, FT40/BCN and FT30/BCN respectively.There is a substantial improvement in the TC removal rate for FT30/BCN as compared to bare BCN and FeTiO 2 which is due to higher visible capture capacity, reduced recombination and high charge transfer capacity on formation of heterojunction.With increase in content of FeTiO 2 in BCN, the TC degradation increases dramatically, but with very high content i. e 40FeTiO 2 the TC removal decreased.This is attributed to the fact that excess of FeTiO 2 not only hinders the interfacial contact, but also redundant material acts as recombination centres ().The high performance of FT30/BCN is supported by observations from UV-DRS, EIS, PCR and PL measurements.The pseudo-firstorder kinetic analysis for TC degradation is revealed in Fig. 6(b).The plots show that reaction rate for FT30/BCN (k app 0.7123 min -1 ) is nearly 7 times that of bare BCN (0.01246 min -1 ). During the photocatalytic process, pH, presence of electrolytes, water matrix and light source tend to affect the catalyst performance via controlling the surface charge distribution and production of active oxygen species.Fig. 6(c) shows that initial pH has a pronounced effect on the TC degradation by FT30/BCN under visible light.The highest TC removal was found to be 96.2 at pH 5.4 and this was chosen as optimized pH for all the experiments.TC possesses three different pKa values, i. e 3.30, 7.7 and 9.7 (Yi et al., 2020).The pH, pKa and pzc of the catalyst govern the interactions with the TC molecules and also control the strength of hydroxyl and superoxide radical anions in the system.The drug exists as (i) H 4 TC at pH 3.3, (ii) H 3 TC in the pH 3.3-7.7,(iii) H 2 TC -in the pH 7.7-9.7 and (iv) HTC 2-at pH 12.The higher degradation at pH 5.5 could be attributed to the attractive electrostatic force between H 3 TC and FT30/BCN (pzc 7.2).Highly acidic medium limits the adsorption due to repulsive forces and similar behaviour is expected at very high pH.Also, the alkaline medium leads to quenching of OH radicals (Kumar et al., 2020a). Further, effect of some common cations and anions onto TC removal with FT30/BCN catalyst was studied and results are shown in Fig. 6(d).Evidently it can be seen that Cl -and Na ions have no noticeable effect on the photocatalytic efficiency.It's worth mentioning that NO 3 -ions promote in the TC photodegradation (k app 0.07622 min -1 ).This is attributed to the fact that NO 3 -forms excited state on visible light irradiation to form NO 2 and OH which accelerates the TC degradation. On the other hand, HCO 3 -ions have an detrimental effect on TC removal (k app 0.06061 min -1 ) because they consume OH radicals to produce CO 3 -radicals.These radicals are less reactive than hydroxyl radicals and thus the degradation rate falls.The degree of inhibition is higher in case of SO 4 2-ions because they are effective radical scavengers (Tang et al., 2020b).However, Mg 2 showed little inhibitory effect, which may be attributed decrease of pH value and Ca 2 cause inhibition in TC removal because they tend to form co-ordination complexes with the drug molecule (Liu et al., 2020) and similar observations have been found in our previous works too (Kumar et al., 2020a).It is well known that Ca 2 ions form 1:2 ligand:metal complex with TC via chelation (Wessels et al., 1998).As it was observed that inorganic ions have a significant on the TC removal rate, we tested the degradation efficiency in real water system i. e river water, tap water and municipal water (Fig. 6(e)).The water quality parameters are listed in table S1.The TC removal efficiency of 96.2, 93.4, 92.3 and 94.1 in distilled water (DW), Municipal drinking water (MW), tap water (TW) and river water (RW) respectively.Definitely, presence of various ions, natural organic matter etc. leads to variation in the performance in various water matrices.However, it is clearly inferred that FT30/BCN heterojunction has a high potential in practical purification of waste water.Further, the TC degradation efficiency and total organic carbon (TOC) with FT30/BCN catalyst was tested under visible and solar light (Fig. 6(f)).Under natural solar light, 84.1 and 81.2 TC was removed in 60 min in DW and RW respectively.A high mineralization was also reported with 77.2 and 64.3 TOC removal in 2 h under visible and solar light in distilled water.A high TC degradation and TOC removal in river water both under visible light and solar light.This again establishes the findings that FT30/BCN heterojunction has a promising future in real waste water treatment. Radical scavenging experiments were performed to assess the role of reactive oxygen species involved in TC degradation under visible light.Fig. 6(g) shows the effect of 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1oxyl (TEMPOL), isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) as scavengers for et al., 2021).P7 with m/z 384 stemmed from the C-N bond cleavage from P6. P5 with m/z 396 was the by-product of TC methylation.P4 is decomposed into P6 (m/z 413) through the ring-opening process.P6 is continuously oxidized and decomposed to P8 (m/z 256) (ring break and removal of -COOH and -OH groups) and P9 (m/z 218).Further oxidations and decomposition via ring opening leads to formation of simpler moieties with m/Z 159 and 102 (Derikvandi et al., 2021).The intermediates are consistent with reported findings (Tang et al., 2020b).Further oxidation leads to formation of simpler aliphatic molecules and mineralized in longer run into inorganic compounds and gases as supported by high TOC removal findings. A suitable photocatalytic mechanism was predicted on basis of XPS, scavenging experiments, DFT calculations and ESR findings.The ESR DMPO- O 2 -spectrum (Fig. 6(h)) shows high intensity peaks (1:1:1:1) under visible light and no peaks in dark.This suggests that O 2 -radicals are major active species responsible for TC degradation and are present in higher concentration.Also, the DMPO- OH spectrum shows low intensity spectra (1:2:2:1) suggesting a little role of OH radicals in the degradation reaction.These results are supported by scavenging experiments.The thermodynamic feasibility of radical generation can be understood by analysing the band structure.As discussed earlier, from DFT calculations it was found that FeTiO 2 with a higher work function and low fermi level is a typical Oxidation type photocatalyst (OP).On the contrast, BCN has a lower work function with high Fermi level as for a typical reduction photocatalyst (RP).Thus, on contact (Fig. 7(b)) the electrons flow from BCN to FeTiO till Fermi levels align and the built-in electric field further restricts the movement of electrons.However, on exposure, as the electron-holes are produced in BCN and FeTiO 2 , the electrons move from CB of FeTiO towards VB of BCN benefitting from internal electric field, band bending (discussed earlier) and Coulomb interactions.The electrons from CB of FeTiO 2 (-0.19 eV) easily recombine with holes in VB of BCN (1.25 eV).However the recombination of electrons from BCN CB and holes from VB of FeTiO 2 is restrained by internal electric field.Thus a Step scheme (S-scheme) is operational here.The charge transfer in the Sscheme mechanism is shown in Fig. 7(c).Thus, the relatively useless photogenerated electrons in CB of FeTiO 2 (-0.19 eV) because they don't have enough energy for generation of The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O was tested under visible light without using any organic sacrificial reagent.Without use of Scheme 1. Possible degradation route of TC. any catalyst no gases were detected.The two major products detected were CH 4 and CO and traces of CH 3 OH.No or non-detectable hydrogen gas was evolved.Fig. 8 (a) and (b) shows the CO 2 conversion efficiency into CH 4 and CO with time respectively.The pristine BCN exhibits very low photocatalytic efficiency with 30.1 mol g -1 CH 4 evolution in 5 h of visible light irradiation.The sample FT30/BCN shows best photocatalytic performance with 123.2 mol g -1 and 10.3 mol g -1 CH 4 and CO evolution respectively.The cumulative CH 4 and CO evolution showing the selectivity of various samples is shown in Fig. 8(c).The CH 4 evolution follows the order: FT30/BCN (24.7 mol g -1 h -1 ) FT40/ BCN (20.4 mol g -1 h -1 ) FT20/BCN (18.4 mol g -1 h -1 ) FT10/BCN (14.2 mol g -1 h -1 ) FeTiO 2 (9.3 mol g -1 h -1 ) BCN (3.6 mol g -1 h -1 ).Comparing the gas evolution rates, it can be seen that FT30/BCN shows highest CH 4 evolution with 91.1 CH 4 selectivity (poor CO evolution 3.6 mol g -1 h -1 ).The average gas evolution, total electrons consumed in reduction and CH 4 selectivity of all samples is listed in Table 1.Comparing with the single catalyst BCN, it is observed that for BCN CO is evolved in higher amounts than CH 4 .However, CH 4 selectivity is higher in FeTiO 2 , though total efficiency is quite low.FT30/ BCN shows highest CH 4 selectivity.Owing to higher recombination rate and poor charge separation, the CO 2 conversion is poor in single semiconductors.However, on formation of heterojunction, dramatic conversion efficiency and CH 4 selectivity is observed.The performance is enhanced owing to following reasons: Firstly the improved quantum efficiency on junction formation, higher charge separation and effective S-scheme transfer mechanism as discussed in earlier sections.Secondly, the BCN nanosheets allow enough CO 2 adsorption and better binding of CO 2 molecules to the metal ions for higher reduction rate as more active sites ensure higher reduction (He et al., 2020).With the higher charge separation facilitated by built-in electric field in the heterojunction, more electrons are produced with time having high redox capability which brings about high CO 2 photoreduction.As seen in Scheme 2, the CH 4 evolution is an 8H /8e -reaction and CO formation is 2H /2e - reaction.Thus kinetically CO formation is favoured, however, CH 4 evolution is thermodynamically favourable.The thermodynamic and kinetic control thus plays important role in the selectivity (Li et al., 2020a). It has been well documented that hydrogen evolution (via water splitting) often competes with and CO 2 reduction (Li et al., 2012).However, non-detectable i. e extremely low yield, H 2 was evolved during the photocatalytic reaction. Firstly, the CO 2 photo-reduction performance was tested under alkali activation i. e using 0.2 M NaOH solution instead of distilled water.Fig. 8(d) shows the CH 4 evolution in 5 h time course under alkali activation.It can be observed that the CH 4 evolution increased to high extent for each catalyst i. e BCN, FeTiO 2 , FT10/BCN and FT30/BCN.For best performing FT30/BCN photocatalyst, under alkali activation, the CH 4 yield gets nearly doubled from 123.2 mol g -1 to 214.5 mol g -1 .The increase in CH 4 evolution is more prominent in heterojunction than in single semiconductors BCN and FeTiO 2 .The increase in the methane yield with alkali activation is attributed to following reasonsthe presence of alkalinity improves the CO 2 solubility and hydroxyl radical formation.The formation of hydroxyl radicals supports the electron-holes separation and favours CO 2 reduction. The photocatalytic performance of FT30/BCN heterojunction was further tested with variation of initial CO 2 /H 2 O feed ratio and keeping rest of parameters same.During the experiment, when CO 2 is passed through water saturator, the quantity of H 2 O vapors carried by CO 2 is dependent on the water vapour pressure.The high temperature favours more water vapors which makes CO 2 more saturated with H 2 O and thus the CO 2 /H 2 O feed ratio will be low.Conversely, low temperature leads to higher CO 2 /H 2 O feed ratio.The temperature of water saturator was maintained at 20, 30 and 40 C. Thus at 10 C, the feed contains highest CO 2 and at 40 C has lowest CO 2 content.Fig. 8(e) shows the effect of CO 2 /H 2 O feed ratio on photo-reduction of CO 2 under visible light with FT30/BCN.The performance order for CH 4 evolution in 5 h is as follows: 123.2 mol g -1 (30 C) 94.5 mol g -1 (40 C) and 70.2 mol g -1 (20 C).At 10 C (high CO 2 /H 2 O feed ratio) the CH 4 yield is lowest.The production rate increased at 30 C and then declined at 40 C further.At higher CO 2 /H 2 O feed ratio, more CO 2 gets attached to the photocatalyst surface and occupies to more active sites as compared to H 2 O molecules.The quantity of H 2 O molecules will thus not be enough to carry out the oxidation and produce lesser H and also lead to higher recombination.So when temperature is increased to higher temperature 40 C (lower CO 2 /H 2 O feed ratio), more of H 2 O molecules gets attached to catalytic sites and would lower the photocatalytic rate.The best performance is achieved at 30 C when appropriate number of H 2 O and CO 2 molecules gets attached to surface resulting in enough oxidation and reduction reactions with diminished recombination rate.In general higher H 2 O content would favour more CH 4 production, but very high content will hamper the photocatalytic reaction rate (Tahir and Tahir, 2020). Further, we investigated the performance of FT30/BCN composite photocatalyst using different reducing agents (H 2 O, methanol and H 2 ) Fig. 7.The S-scheme heterojunction of FeTiO 2 /BCN (a) before contact, (b) after contact, and (c) after contact upon irradiation and charge migration and separation.and light source (visible and solar light) (Fig. 8 f).Under all the experiments CH 4 and CO were the major products.With CO 2 water system, under visible light as discussed earlier higher CH 4 production (123 mol g -1 ) was obtained.With MeOH (methanol) as reducing agent, high yields of CH 4 (160.2mol g -1 ) and CO (18.6 mol g -1 ) were obtained.The CH 4 evolution under CO 2 MeOH was 1.3 times that of CO 2 H 2 O system.No hydrogen was detected.In CO 2 H 2 system also, appreciable quantity of CH 4 and CO were evolved.But the CO evolution was higher as compared to CH 4 with hydrogen as reducing agent which is consistent with earlier findings (Tahir et al., 2020).With methanol due to more protons (H ) production the CH 4 removal was significantly enhanced.Thus reducing agents have a pronounced effect on CO 2 conversion efficiency and CH 4 selectivity.Under solar light CO 2 H 2 O system a high CH 4 evolution 98.7 mol g -1 in 5 h is obtained with high selectivity.Thus, FT30/BCN photocatalyst is capable of efficient solar-to-fuel conversion with high selectivity and promising in real fuel production applications. As discussed earlier, the CH 4 evolution is an 8e -/8H reaction progressed by multiple steps and also via a multiple proton-coupled electron transfer route for high methane selectivity.With the progress of photocatalytic reaction, more photogenerated electrons are produced.Because of an effective S-scheme transfer between FeTiO 2 and BCN a high electron-holes separation is ensured.The FT30/BCN photocatalyst shows high charge transfer capacity, photocurrent response and highly diminished electron-hole recombination.Thus more electrons are available for high and selective CH 4 production.The pzc of the photocatalyst is 7.2 and thus slightly basic characteristics favour more CO 2 adsorption and hydrogenation too.Secondly it can be explained in The average gas evolution rates and CH 4 selectivity for various samples under visible light. Gas evolution (mol g another way that because of presence of RGO basic characteristics are induced on surface of ABR catalyst as pzc is 7.4, CO 2 adsorption and hydrogenation is favoured.The conversion of CO 2 into CO is a more favoured step involving 2H / 2e -mechanism.The S-scheme transfer mechanism which has already been discussed in previous sections saves the electrons and holes in high potential conduction band and valence band respectively.The redox potential for E o (CO/CO 2 ) -0.42eV and E o (CH 4 /CO 2 ) -0.24eV.The electrons accumulated in CB of BCN (-1.2 eV) are capable of for reducing CO 2 to CH 4 by route involving by single step multi electron transfer with proton coupling.The holes accumulated in VB of FeTiO 2 (2.51 eV) have high potential to produce protons from water.Thus the higher charge separation and availability of high potential electrons favour the high conversion efficiency and CH 4 selectivity.Also the short diffusion length of thin exfoliated BCN nanosheets generates more electrons on visible light exposure and favours CH 4 production.As seen in O 1s XPS spectrum in FT30/BCN, there are numerous O vacancies on the surface which trap electrons generated by BCN and FeTiO 2 and boost the photocatalytic activity.Furthermore, isotope experiment with 13 CO 2 and 12 CO 2 were performed for visible light CO 2 H 2 O FT30/BCN system (Figure S5).The existence of peaks at m/z 16 and m/z 17 for CH 4 shows that reduction products are reduced from the CO 2 and not by any other reaction or route. We have also predicted two more mechanisms for high CH 4 selectivity with FT30/BCN catalyst as shown in Fig. 9.It has been reported earlier also that selectivity can be increased via coordination activation.As seen in Ti 2p XPS spectrum, Ti 3 is present on TiO 2 surface and will act as an active site with presence of unpaired electrons.The CO 2 molecules get adsorbed onto photocatalyst via coordination to lewis base site i. e Ti 3 for instance (Sree et al., 2009).As seen in Fig. 9(a), The bridging TiCOO -Ti will be formed on TiO 2 sites located uniformly on thin BCN nanosheets.The adsorbed CO 2 molecules can interact with Ti 3 (as shown in Figure ) via an interfacial charge transfer mechanism thereby decreasing the required activation energy.On exposure to light, the 2 photo-generated electrons will transfer to the co-ordinated CO 2 molecules i. e TiC.Simultaneously, the H (protons) get connected into TiCOO -Ti via electrostatic forces of attraction to form TiHCOO -Ti intermediate as reported in a related previous work (Wang et al., 2021).This intermediate further gets converted into TiHCHO -Ti and TiCH 3 O -Ti which via further protonation and electron transfer (shown in Fig. 9(a)) leads to detachment of CH 4 molecule from catalyst surface.On the other hand, the holes (h ) would generate hydroxyl radicals.This explains the highly selective CH 4 formation.Fig. 9(b) shows the other way for CH 4 formation.The presence of FeTiO 2 facilitates two metal sites on to FT30/BCN heterojunction photcatalyst.Thus, Fe and Ti both can bond concurrently with C and O atoms (in CO 2 -as shown in figure)to form Fe-C-O-Ti i. e M 1 -C-O-M 2 reaction intermediate which favours only CH 4 formation.This is attributed to the fact that it is not easy to break both M 1 -C and M 2 -O bonds simultaneously.On the contrast, it's rather easy to dissociate C-H bonds via continuous protonation which weakens the M 1 -C and M 2 -O bonds simultaneously and produce CH 4 (Jiao et al., 2020). The in-situ XPS characterization, DFT analysis, scavenging experiments probe and band structure analysis predicts an exclusive S-scheme electron transfer mechanism for efficient electron separation and charge transfer capacity for efficient CO 2 reduction. The stability and reusability of the photocatalyst FT30/BCN was tested both for photocatalytic TC degradation and CO 2 reduction.Figure S6 shows that there is no abnormal loss in the activity of FT30/ BCN for TC degradation under visible light.A negligible fall in the TC removal rate was observed.The XRD pattern and SEM micrograph of FT30/BCN (Figure S7) obtained after reuse and recovery shows there is no change the structure and morphology.Thus catalyst is robust, highly stable and recyclable.Further, metal leaching tests were performed for Fe and Ti using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) (Agilent 8800 ICP-QQQ).Figure S8 shows that at pH 2 minor leaching rates were observed for Fe (0.03) and Ti (0.027).The leaching rates are negligible at pH 4.The ultra-low/negligible leaching shows the FT30/BCN photocatalyst is highly stable and does not promote secondary pollution.The catalytic stability of FT30/BCN was further investigated by carrying out the CO 2 reduction under visible light (Figure S9).It can be observed that the high rate of CH 4 evolution is maintained for three cycles i. e 15 h of experiment."}, {"llm generation": "visible light", "source": "Furthermore, isotope experiment with 13 CO 2 and 12 CO 2 were performed for visible light CO 2 H 2 O FT30/BCN system (Figure S5).", "context": "3.1.Characterization Fig. 2 (a) shows the XRD patterns of synthesized photocatalysts.The XRD pattern for BCN shows a peak at 26.7 corresponding to graphitic structure of pristine boron carbon nitride which is well matched with ICDD PDF 53-0447.The peak at 43.1 corresponds to the (111) diffraction planes of BCN in sync with ICDD PDF 51-0768) (Chen et al., 2018).For Fe doped TiO 2 , the diffraction peaks corresponding to (110), ( 101), ( 200), ( 111), ( 210), ( 211), ( 220), ( 002), (311), and ( 112) are observed corresponding to tetragonal rutile TiO 2 which is in good agreement with (JCPDS No. 21-1276) (Wang et al., 2015).A slight shift is observed in 2 values as compared to pure rutile TiO 2 from literature because of doping as there is a difference in ionic radii of Fe and Ti.Fe doped TiO 2 is present in single phase without any trace of clusters of Fe as doping of Fe has been done on Ti sites in TiO 2 matrix.As doping content is less than 5 atomic there is no formation of any secondary phase related to Fe.The XRD patterns of binary junction series as FT/BCN show characteristic peaks of both FeTiO 2 and BCN with no extra phases.The peak intensities for BCN are highly reduced in the heterojunction.Change in intensities is observed which is due to variable content of BCN and FeTiO 2 and also due to the crystallinity differences between the two. The specific surface areas for FeTiO 2 and FT30/BCN were calculated as 32.1 m 2 /g and 74.4 m 2 /g, respectively.The adsorption isotherms (Figure S1) belong to typical type-IV isotherm with H3 type hysteresis loop.The mean pore volume and pore size for FeTiO 2 were 0.14 cm 3 /g, and 21.1 nm, respectively.The pore size and pore volume for FT30/BCN were 16.1 nm and 0.23 cm 3 /g, respectively.The surface area is increased on inclusion of BCN into FeTiO 2 which leads to increase in active sites, promoting the photocatalytic activity.The pore volume increased on inclusion of BCN because of improved dispersity of BCN and FeTiO 2 and the re-creation of pores.It is well known that a large surface area and porous structure favour the enhancement of the photocatalytic property via providing more active sites, accelerating the mass transfer or diffusion.The high surface area improves the photon utilization efficiency by providing more exposure and multiple reflections along the pores. The electronic environment, elemental composition and oxidation states of BCN and FT30/BCN were investigated by XPS analysis (Fig. 3).The survey scan (Figure S2) shows the presence of B, C, N in BCN and Fe, Ti, O, B, C, N in the FT30/BCN composite catalyst.In addition the XPS spectra were also obtained for FT30/BCN photocatalyst after visible light illumination to ascertain the binding energy shifts.Fig. 3(a) shows the B1s spectra for BCN and FT30/BCN.The spectra is deconvoluted into two peaks at 189.4 eV (B1) and 190.1 eV (B2) corresponding to B-C and B-N bonds respectively in BCN (Chang et al., 2013).For FT30/BCN heterojunction, in absence of light irradiation, slightly positive shift in B. E is exhibited compared to bare BCN.This signifies that electrons shift from BCN to FeTiO 2 .After light irradiation, a negative shift in B.E signifies, the electrons transfer from FeTiO 2 towards BCN (Kumar et al., 2020a).These findings are supported by C 1s, Ti 2p and O 1s spectra.(Zhou et al., 2018).The B.E exhibits positive shifts in FT30/BCN without light irradiation and negative shift upon illumination.This confirms the electrons shift from BCN towards FeTiO 2 towards on contact and FeTiO 2 to BCN upon illumination.These observations can be further verified from Ti 2p and O 1s spectra.Fig. 3(c) shows the deconvoluted Ti 2p spectra at 459.4 and 465.3 eV, assigned to Ti 2p 3/2 and Ti 2p 1/2 , respectively for Ti 4 oxidation state in TiO 2 (Li et al., 2020b).The peak at 459.9 eV corresponds to Ti 2p 1/2 for Ti 3 oxidation state.Thus both the oxidation states for Ti exist in the material.The Ti 2p spectra for the junction FT30/BCN shows negative shift in binding energies, confirming the electron shift from BCN to FeTiO 2 .Upon illumination B.E for Ti 2p shifts towards higher side, confirming the electron f low from FeTiO 2 towards BCN. The high-resolution O 1s XPS spectra for FT30/BCN (Fig. 3(d)) show three peaks at 528.5, 529.8 and 530.8 eV corresponding to lattice oxygen (metal-O bond), oxygen vacancies, loosely bound O/adsorbed OH groups respectively (Dhiman et al., 2017).The N 1s spectra (Fig. 3(e)) is deconvoluted into three peaks at 399.9, 401.2 and 402.8 eV which can be assigned to N-B, N-C and N-H bonds respectively (Zhou et al., 2020).The Fe 2p spectrum (Fig. 3(e)) shows two peaks at 715.6 and 729.4 eV corresponding 2p 3/2 and 2p 1/2 oxidation states for Fe 2 oxidation state.The peak positioned at 737.3 eV is assigned to 2p 1/2 for Fe 3 oxidation state.The satellite peak at 721.6 eV confirsm the presence of both Fe 2 and Fe 3 oxidation states.The Ti 3 oxidation state in the catalyst exists due to the generation of oxygen vacancies (OVs reduce the Ti 4 ) (Ye et al., 2021).Comparing the Ti 2p and O 1s spectra in FeTiO2 and FT30/BCN we can observe that there are changes in intensities of Ti as well as O 1s.There are changes in oxygen vacancies in the heterojunction as compared to FeTiO2 which will certainly change the intensity of Ti 3 . The B.E shifts confirm that after the contact between FeTiO 2 and BCN to form the FT/BCN heterojunction, there is electron transfer from BCN to FeTiO 2 .This migration is actually caused by difference in Fermi levels of two semiconductors.As BCN has a higher Fermi level than FeTiO 2 (see DFT calculations discussed later) the difference will drive the migration of electrons from BCN to FeTiO 2 until Fermi levels are aligned (Xia et al., 2020).Thus an internal electric field is created at the semiconductors interface.After illumination the band edge positioning and the internal electric field lead to migration of electrons from FeTiO 2 to BCN by an effective S-scheme transfer.The detailed analysis has been discussed in subsequent sections. The morphology and microstructure of BCN and FT30/BCN was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).Fig. 4(a) shows that exfoliated BCN exhibits lamellar sheets like morphology.The low resolution SEM image of FT30/BCN (Fig. 4 b) shows the spherical FeTiO 2 nanoparticles distributed uniformly over the irregular porous sheet of BCN.The high resolution image further shows that the spherical and uniform FeTiO 2 nanoparticles are in intimate contact with BCN sheets (Fig. 4(c)).Further microstructure was ascertained by TEM analysis.The lamellar nanosheets structure of exfoliated BCN can be observed in Fig. 4(d).The TEM image of FT30/BCN (Fig. 4(e)) confirms the uniform distribution of the spherical FeTiO 2 nanoparticles on to the BCN nanosheets.The high intimate contact between the two is surely beneficial for the electron flow and hence the photocatalytic activity.The HRTEM image (Fig. 4(f)) confirms the intimate contact and crystallinity.The lattice fringes of FeTiO 2 can be seen and the data matches with the XRD findings.However, due to poor crystallinity of BCN, it is difficult to observe the lattice fringes for the same.The presence of distributed Ti, O, Fe, B, C and N elements in FT30/BCN is shown in the SEM elemental mapping and corresponding elemental distribution (Fig. 4 g-m).This further demonstrates the close interfacial contact of two components and successful formation of the binary heterojunction. The light absorption properties of BCN, FeTiO 2 and FT30/BCN were characterized by the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-vis DRS) shown in Fig. 5(a).The BCN obviously absorbs in the visible range with absorption edge near 580 nm TiO 2 has a higher band gap with absorption in UV region.However, with 1.5 Fe doping, the absorption edge shows red shift with a better absorption in visible region.The heterojunction FT30/BCN shows a high absorption edge as compared to FeTiO 2 because oof inclusion of low band gap BCN.The increased optical harvesting improves quantum efficiency and photoredox catalysis.The band gap energy (E g ) was caluclated using Kubelka-Munk function (Kumar et al., 2020c).Therefore, the E g values for FeTiO 2 and BCN were estimated to be 2.70 and 2.45 eV, respectively (Fig. 5(b)). The band gap energy for FT30/BCN heterojunction (Figure S3) was found to be 2.57 eV.Further, Mott-Schottky function was utilized to estimate flat band potential (V FB ) as shown in Fig. 5(c-d).The V FB for BCN and FeTiO 2 are found to be 0.1 V and -1.0 V vs NHE respectively. The conduction band edge (E CB ) for an n-type semiconductor (as can be seen in M -S plots that both semiconductors are n-type) is generally 0.1-0.2eV (vs NHE) below the flat band energy (Kumar et al., 2020a). Considering the difference as 0.2 eV, the CB edges are calculated as -1.2 eV and -0.19 eV vs NHE for BCN and FeTiO 2 respectively.Finally, the VB edges (E VB ) were found to be 1.25 eV and 2.51 eV vs NHE for BCN and FeTiO 2 respectively.Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) derived Nyquist plots for BCN, FeTiO 2 and FT30/BCN are shown in Fig. 5(e).Evidently, FT30/BCN exhibits smallest arc radius as compared to bare semiconductors inferring that the heterojunction has lowest charge transfer resistance or highest transfer capacity.The photo-current density (Fig. 5 (f)) of FT30/BCN is significantly enhanced on the junction formation between FeTiO 2 and BCN which is consistent with EIS findings.The high photocurrent response (PCR) of the junction is attributed to higher visible absorption, high charge transfer capacity, reduced recombination and electron aggregation.This was further supported by photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy findings (Fig. 5(g)).The PL intensity falls dramatically in the heterojunction, suggesting that electron-hole recombination is highly diminished.Interestingly, the charge separation improves with increase in content of FeTiO 2 in BCN i. e from FT10/BCN to FT30/BCN.In addition, to elucidate the photo-induced electrons transfer direction and mechanism active at the FeTiO 2 and BCN interface, DFT calculations were employed.The DFT calculation was used to measure the electron density difference between the semiconductors.Fig. 5 (h) shows that FeTiO 2 is a typical oxidation photocatalyst (OP) with a large work function of 6.70 eV.On the other hand, BCN has a lower work function (3.51 eV) (Fig. 5(i)) and is a reduction photocatalyst (RP) quite similar to carbon nitride (Fu et al., 2019).Generally, the Fermi level position is inversely related to the work function.Fig. 9(a-c) shows the electron transfer mechanism in FT/BCN heterojunction.Thus, the Fermi level of BCN is higher than FeTiO 2 Before contact, the CB and VB positioning of FeTiO 2 and BCN shows that they form a staggered arrangement.After contact, the electrons spontaneously migrate from BCN towards FeTiO 2 across their interface until Fermi levels reach equilibrium.The electron output from BCN results in the bending of CB edge upwards.On the contrary, the band edge of FeTiO 2 gets bent downwards because of accumulation of electrons.Hence an internal electric field is set-up.The movement of electrons from BCN leads to formation of internal electric field which further prevents the further migration from BCN to FeTiO 2. On illumination, the electrons and holes get excited in both the semiconductors and the electrons from CB of FeTiO 2 gets migrated to VB of BCN and recombine with holes.This is facilitated by internal electric field and Coulomb interaction.These facts are supported by B.E shifts in XPS findings.The detailed mechanism is discussed in subsequent directions. Systematic tetracycline (TC) photocatalytic degradation experiments were conducted under visible light irradiation using 300 W Xe lamp (with visible light filter).Considering, the adsorption equilibrium, the stirring was performed under dark conditions for 30 min.Figure S4 shows that FT30/BCN shows 87.1 TC removal in 90 min with 31.2 adsorption in dark in 30 min.From 22.1 to 31.1 there is no substantial improvement in adsorption potential as we move from BCN to FT30/ BCN.However, FT30/BCN shows highest adsorption capacity because of high surface area and active sites as also supported by BET adsorption isotherms results.Secondly, under direct exposure, better performance was recorded as can be seen in Fig. 6(a).As shown, after 60 min visible light treatment, the TC removal rates of 45.1, 52.3, 70.1, 85.4, 93.1 and 96.2 were obtained in presence of BCN, FeTiO 2 , FT10/ BCN, FT20/BCN, FT40/BCN and FT30/BCN respectively.There is a substantial improvement in the TC removal rate for FT30/BCN as compared to bare BCN and FeTiO 2 which is due to higher visible capture capacity, reduced recombination and high charge transfer capacity on formation of heterojunction.With increase in content of FeTiO 2 in BCN, the TC degradation increases dramatically, but with very high content i. e 40FeTiO 2 the TC removal decreased.This is attributed to the fact that excess of FeTiO 2 not only hinders the interfacial contact, but also redundant material acts as recombination centres ().The high performance of FT30/BCN is supported by observations from UV-DRS, EIS, PCR and PL measurements.The pseudo-firstorder kinetic analysis for TC degradation is revealed in Fig. 6(b).The plots show that reaction rate for FT30/BCN (k app 0.7123 min -1 ) is nearly 7 times that of bare BCN (0.01246 min -1 ). During the photocatalytic process, pH, presence of electrolytes, water matrix and light source tend to affect the catalyst performance via controlling the surface charge distribution and production of active oxygen species.Fig. 6(c) shows that initial pH has a pronounced effect on the TC degradation by FT30/BCN under visible light.The highest TC removal was found to be 96.2 at pH 5.4 and this was chosen as optimized pH for all the experiments.TC possesses three different pKa values, i. e 3.30, 7.7 and 9.7 (Yi et al., 2020).The pH, pKa and pzc of the catalyst govern the interactions with the TC molecules and also control the strength of hydroxyl and superoxide radical anions in the system.The drug exists as (i) H 4 TC at pH 3.3, (ii) H 3 TC in the pH 3.3-7.7,(iii) H 2 TC -in the pH 7.7-9.7 and (iv) HTC 2-at pH 12.The higher degradation at pH 5.5 could be attributed to the attractive electrostatic force between H 3 TC and FT30/BCN (pzc 7.2).Highly acidic medium limits the adsorption due to repulsive forces and similar behaviour is expected at very high pH.Also, the alkaline medium leads to quenching of OH radicals (Kumar et al., 2020a). Further, effect of some common cations and anions onto TC removal with FT30/BCN catalyst was studied and results are shown in Fig. 6(d).Evidently it can be seen that Cl -and Na ions have no noticeable effect on the photocatalytic efficiency.It's worth mentioning that NO 3 -ions promote in the TC photodegradation (k app 0.07622 min -1 ).This is attributed to the fact that NO 3 -forms excited state on visible light irradiation to form NO 2 and OH which accelerates the TC degradation. On the other hand, HCO 3 -ions have an detrimental effect on TC removal (k app 0.06061 min -1 ) because they consume OH radicals to produce CO 3 -radicals.These radicals are less reactive than hydroxyl radicals and thus the degradation rate falls.The degree of inhibition is higher in case of SO 4 2-ions because they are effective radical scavengers (Tang et al., 2020b).However, Mg 2 showed little inhibitory effect, which may be attributed decrease of pH value and Ca 2 cause inhibition in TC removal because they tend to form co-ordination complexes with the drug molecule (Liu et al., 2020) and similar observations have been found in our previous works too (Kumar et al., 2020a).It is well known that Ca 2 ions form 1:2 ligand:metal complex with TC via chelation (Wessels et al., 1998).As it was observed that inorganic ions have a significant on the TC removal rate, we tested the degradation efficiency in real water system i. e river water, tap water and municipal water (Fig. 6(e)).The water quality parameters are listed in table S1.The TC removal efficiency of 96.2, 93.4, 92.3 and 94.1 in distilled water (DW), Municipal drinking water (MW), tap water (TW) and river water (RW) respectively.Definitely, presence of various ions, natural organic matter etc. leads to variation in the performance in various water matrices.However, it is clearly inferred that FT30/BCN heterojunction has a high potential in practical purification of waste water.Further, the TC degradation efficiency and total organic carbon (TOC) with FT30/BCN catalyst was tested under visible and solar light (Fig. 6(f)).Under natural solar light, 84.1 and 81.2 TC was removed in 60 min in DW and RW respectively.A high mineralization was also reported with 77.2 and 64.3 TOC removal in 2 h under visible and solar light in distilled water.A high TC degradation and TOC removal in river water both under visible light and solar light.This again establishes the findings that FT30/BCN heterojunction has a promising future in real waste water treatment. Radical scavenging experiments were performed to assess the role of reactive oxygen species involved in TC degradation under visible light.Fig. 6(g) shows the effect of 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1oxyl (TEMPOL), isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) as scavengers for et al., 2021).P7 with m/z 384 stemmed from the C-N bond cleavage from P6. P5 with m/z 396 was the by-product of TC methylation.P4 is decomposed into P6 (m/z 413) through the ring-opening process.P6 is continuously oxidized and decomposed to P8 (m/z 256) (ring break and removal of -COOH and -OH groups) and P9 (m/z 218).Further oxidations and decomposition via ring opening leads to formation of simpler moieties with m/Z 159 and 102 (Derikvandi et al., 2021).The intermediates are consistent with reported findings (Tang et al., 2020b).Further oxidation leads to formation of simpler aliphatic molecules and mineralized in longer run into inorganic compounds and gases as supported by high TOC removal findings. A suitable photocatalytic mechanism was predicted on basis of XPS, scavenging experiments, DFT calculations and ESR findings.The ESR DMPO- O 2 -spectrum (Fig. 6(h)) shows high intensity peaks (1:1:1:1) under visible light and no peaks in dark.This suggests that O 2 -radicals are major active species responsible for TC degradation and are present in higher concentration.Also, the DMPO- OH spectrum shows low intensity spectra (1:2:2:1) suggesting a little role of OH radicals in the degradation reaction.These results are supported by scavenging experiments.The thermodynamic feasibility of radical generation can be understood by analysing the band structure.As discussed earlier, from DFT calculations it was found that FeTiO 2 with a higher work function and low fermi level is a typical Oxidation type photocatalyst (OP).On the contrast, BCN has a lower work function with high Fermi level as for a typical reduction photocatalyst (RP).Thus, on contact (Fig. 7(b)) the electrons flow from BCN to FeTiO till Fermi levels align and the built-in electric field further restricts the movement of electrons.However, on exposure, as the electron-holes are produced in BCN and FeTiO 2 , the electrons move from CB of FeTiO towards VB of BCN benefitting from internal electric field, band bending (discussed earlier) and Coulomb interactions.The electrons from CB of FeTiO 2 (-0.19 eV) easily recombine with holes in VB of BCN (1.25 eV).However the recombination of electrons from BCN CB and holes from VB of FeTiO 2 is restrained by internal electric field.Thus a Step scheme (S-scheme) is operational here.The charge transfer in the Sscheme mechanism is shown in Fig. 7(c).Thus, the relatively useless photogenerated electrons in CB of FeTiO 2 (-0.19 eV) because they don't have enough energy for generation of The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O was tested under visible light without using any organic sacrificial reagent.Without use of Scheme 1. Possible degradation route of TC. any catalyst no gases were detected.The two major products detected were CH 4 and CO and traces of CH 3 OH.No or non-detectable hydrogen gas was evolved.Fig. 8 (a) and (b) shows the CO 2 conversion efficiency into CH 4 and CO with time respectively.The pristine BCN exhibits very low photocatalytic efficiency with 30.1 mol g -1 CH 4 evolution in 5 h of visible light irradiation.The sample FT30/BCN shows best photocatalytic performance with 123.2 mol g -1 and 10.3 mol g -1 CH 4 and CO evolution respectively.The cumulative CH 4 and CO evolution showing the selectivity of various samples is shown in Fig. 8(c).The CH 4 evolution follows the order: FT30/BCN (24.7 mol g -1 h -1 ) FT40/ BCN (20.4 mol g -1 h -1 ) FT20/BCN (18.4 mol g -1 h -1 ) FT10/BCN (14.2 mol g -1 h -1 ) FeTiO 2 (9.3 mol g -1 h -1 ) BCN (3.6 mol g -1 h -1 ).Comparing the gas evolution rates, it can be seen that FT30/BCN shows highest CH 4 evolution with 91.1 CH 4 selectivity (poor CO evolution 3.6 mol g -1 h -1 ).The average gas evolution, total electrons consumed in reduction and CH 4 selectivity of all samples is listed in Table 1.Comparing with the single catalyst BCN, it is observed that for BCN CO is evolved in higher amounts than CH 4 .However, CH 4 selectivity is higher in FeTiO 2 , though total efficiency is quite low.FT30/ BCN shows highest CH 4 selectivity.Owing to higher recombination rate and poor charge separation, the CO 2 conversion is poor in single semiconductors.However, on formation of heterojunction, dramatic conversion efficiency and CH 4 selectivity is observed.The performance is enhanced owing to following reasons: Firstly the improved quantum efficiency on junction formation, higher charge separation and effective S-scheme transfer mechanism as discussed in earlier sections.Secondly, the BCN nanosheets allow enough CO 2 adsorption and better binding of CO 2 molecules to the metal ions for higher reduction rate as more active sites ensure higher reduction (He et al., 2020).With the higher charge separation facilitated by built-in electric field in the heterojunction, more electrons are produced with time having high redox capability which brings about high CO 2 photoreduction.As seen in Scheme 2, the CH 4 evolution is an 8H /8e -reaction and CO formation is 2H /2e - reaction.Thus kinetically CO formation is favoured, however, CH 4 evolution is thermodynamically favourable.The thermodynamic and kinetic control thus plays important role in the selectivity (Li et al., 2020a). It has been well documented that hydrogen evolution (via water splitting) often competes with and CO 2 reduction (Li et al., 2012).However, non-detectable i. e extremely low yield, H 2 was evolved during the photocatalytic reaction. Firstly, the CO 2 photo-reduction performance was tested under alkali activation i. e using 0.2 M NaOH solution instead of distilled water.Fig. 8(d) shows the CH 4 evolution in 5 h time course under alkali activation.It can be observed that the CH 4 evolution increased to high extent for each catalyst i. e BCN, FeTiO 2 , FT10/BCN and FT30/BCN.For best performing FT30/BCN photocatalyst, under alkali activation, the CH 4 yield gets nearly doubled from 123.2 mol g -1 to 214.5 mol g -1 .The increase in CH 4 evolution is more prominent in heterojunction than in single semiconductors BCN and FeTiO 2 .The increase in the methane yield with alkali activation is attributed to following reasonsthe presence of alkalinity improves the CO 2 solubility and hydroxyl radical formation.The formation of hydroxyl radicals supports the electron-holes separation and favours CO 2 reduction. The photocatalytic performance of FT30/BCN heterojunction was further tested with variation of initial CO 2 /H 2 O feed ratio and keeping rest of parameters same.During the experiment, when CO 2 is passed through water saturator, the quantity of H 2 O vapors carried by CO 2 is dependent on the water vapour pressure.The high temperature favours more water vapors which makes CO 2 more saturated with H 2 O and thus the CO 2 /H 2 O feed ratio will be low.Conversely, low temperature leads to higher CO 2 /H 2 O feed ratio.The temperature of water saturator was maintained at 20, 30 and 40 C. Thus at 10 C, the feed contains highest CO 2 and at 40 C has lowest CO 2 content.Fig. 8(e) shows the effect of CO 2 /H 2 O feed ratio on photo-reduction of CO 2 under visible light with FT30/BCN.The performance order for CH 4 evolution in 5 h is as follows: 123.2 mol g -1 (30 C) 94.5 mol g -1 (40 C) and 70.2 mol g -1 (20 C).At 10 C (high CO 2 /H 2 O feed ratio) the CH 4 yield is lowest.The production rate increased at 30 C and then declined at 40 C further.At higher CO 2 /H 2 O feed ratio, more CO 2 gets attached to the photocatalyst surface and occupies to more active sites as compared to H 2 O molecules.The quantity of H 2 O molecules will thus not be enough to carry out the oxidation and produce lesser H and also lead to higher recombination.So when temperature is increased to higher temperature 40 C (lower CO 2 /H 2 O feed ratio), more of H 2 O molecules gets attached to catalytic sites and would lower the photocatalytic rate.The best performance is achieved at 30 C when appropriate number of H 2 O and CO 2 molecules gets attached to surface resulting in enough oxidation and reduction reactions with diminished recombination rate.In general higher H 2 O content would favour more CH 4 production, but very high content will hamper the photocatalytic reaction rate (Tahir and Tahir, 2020). Further, we investigated the performance of FT30/BCN composite photocatalyst using different reducing agents (H 2 O, methanol and H 2 ) Fig. 7.The S-scheme heterojunction of FeTiO 2 /BCN (a) before contact, (b) after contact, and (c) after contact upon irradiation and charge migration and separation.and light source (visible and solar light) (Fig. 8 f).Under all the experiments CH 4 and CO were the major products.With CO 2 water system, under visible light as discussed earlier higher CH 4 production (123 mol g -1 ) was obtained.With MeOH (methanol) as reducing agent, high yields of CH 4 (160.2mol g -1 ) and CO (18.6 mol g -1 ) were obtained.The CH 4 evolution under CO 2 MeOH was 1.3 times that of CO 2 H 2 O system.No hydrogen was detected.In CO 2 H 2 system also, appreciable quantity of CH 4 and CO were evolved.But the CO evolution was higher as compared to CH 4 with hydrogen as reducing agent which is consistent with earlier findings (Tahir et al., 2020).With methanol due to more protons (H ) production the CH 4 removal was significantly enhanced.Thus reducing agents have a pronounced effect on CO 2 conversion efficiency and CH 4 selectivity.Under solar light CO 2 H 2 O system a high CH 4 evolution 98.7 mol g -1 in 5 h is obtained with high selectivity.Thus, FT30/BCN photocatalyst is capable of efficient solar-to-fuel conversion with high selectivity and promising in real fuel production applications. As discussed earlier, the CH 4 evolution is an 8e -/8H reaction progressed by multiple steps and also via a multiple proton-coupled electron transfer route for high methane selectivity.With the progress of photocatalytic reaction, more photogenerated electrons are produced.Because of an effective S-scheme transfer between FeTiO 2 and BCN a high electron-holes separation is ensured.The FT30/BCN photocatalyst shows high charge transfer capacity, photocurrent response and highly diminished electron-hole recombination.Thus more electrons are available for high and selective CH 4 production.The pzc of the photocatalyst is 7.2 and thus slightly basic characteristics favour more CO 2 adsorption and hydrogenation too.Secondly it can be explained in The average gas evolution rates and CH 4 selectivity for various samples under visible light. Gas evolution (mol g another way that because of presence of RGO basic characteristics are induced on surface of ABR catalyst as pzc is 7.4, CO 2 adsorption and hydrogenation is favoured.The conversion of CO 2 into CO is a more favoured step involving 2H / 2e -mechanism.The S-scheme transfer mechanism which has already been discussed in previous sections saves the electrons and holes in high potential conduction band and valence band respectively.The redox potential for E o (CO/CO 2 ) -0.42eV and E o (CH 4 /CO 2 ) -0.24eV.The electrons accumulated in CB of BCN (-1.2 eV) are capable of for reducing CO 2 to CH 4 by route involving by single step multi electron transfer with proton coupling.The holes accumulated in VB of FeTiO 2 (2.51 eV) have high potential to produce protons from water.Thus the higher charge separation and availability of high potential electrons favour the high conversion efficiency and CH 4 selectivity.Also the short diffusion length of thin exfoliated BCN nanosheets generates more electrons on visible light exposure and favours CH 4 production.As seen in O 1s XPS spectrum in FT30/BCN, there are numerous O vacancies on the surface which trap electrons generated by BCN and FeTiO 2 and boost the photocatalytic activity.Furthermore, isotope experiment with 13 CO 2 and 12 CO 2 were performed for visible light CO 2 H 2 O FT30/BCN system (Figure S5).The existence of peaks at m/z 16 and m/z 17 for CH 4 shows that reduction products are reduced from the CO 2 and not by any other reaction or route. We have also predicted two more mechanisms for high CH 4 selectivity with FT30/BCN catalyst as shown in Fig. 9.It has been reported earlier also that selectivity can be increased via coordination activation.As seen in Ti 2p XPS spectrum, Ti 3 is present on TiO 2 surface and will act as an active site with presence of unpaired electrons.The CO 2 molecules get adsorbed onto photocatalyst via coordination to lewis base site i. e Ti 3 for instance (Sree et al., 2009).As seen in Fig. 9(a), The bridging TiCOO -Ti will be formed on TiO 2 sites located uniformly on thin BCN nanosheets.The adsorbed CO 2 molecules can interact with Ti 3 (as shown in Figure ) via an interfacial charge transfer mechanism thereby decreasing the required activation energy.On exposure to light, the 2 photo-generated electrons will transfer to the co-ordinated CO 2 molecules i. e TiC.Simultaneously, the H (protons) get connected into TiCOO -Ti via electrostatic forces of attraction to form TiHCOO -Ti intermediate as reported in a related previous work (Wang et al., 2021).This intermediate further gets converted into TiHCHO -Ti and TiCH 3 O -Ti which via further protonation and electron transfer (shown in Fig. 9(a)) leads to detachment of CH 4 molecule from catalyst surface.On the other hand, the holes (h ) would generate hydroxyl radicals.This explains the highly selective CH 4 formation.Fig. 9(b) shows the other way for CH 4 formation.The presence of FeTiO 2 facilitates two metal sites on to FT30/BCN heterojunction photcatalyst.Thus, Fe and Ti both can bond concurrently with C and O atoms (in CO 2 -as shown in figure)to form Fe-C-O-Ti i. e M 1 -C-O-M 2 reaction intermediate which favours only CH 4 formation.This is attributed to the fact that it is not easy to break both M 1 -C and M 2 -O bonds simultaneously.On the contrast, it's rather easy to dissociate C-H bonds via continuous protonation which weakens the M 1 -C and M 2 -O bonds simultaneously and produce CH 4 (Jiao et al., 2020). The in-situ XPS characterization, DFT analysis, scavenging experiments probe and band structure analysis predicts an exclusive S-scheme electron transfer mechanism for efficient electron separation and charge transfer capacity for efficient CO 2 reduction. The stability and reusability of the photocatalyst FT30/BCN was tested both for photocatalytic TC degradation and CO 2 reduction.Figure S6 shows that there is no abnormal loss in the activity of FT30/ BCN for TC degradation under visible light.A negligible fall in the TC removal rate was observed.The XRD pattern and SEM micrograph of FT30/BCN (Figure S7) obtained after reuse and recovery shows there is no change the structure and morphology.Thus catalyst is robust, highly stable and recyclable.Further, metal leaching tests were performed for Fe and Ti using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) (Agilent 8800 ICP-QQQ).Figure S8 shows that at pH 2 minor leaching rates were observed for Fe (0.03) and Ti (0.027).The leaching rates are negligible at pH 4.The ultra-low/negligible leaching shows the FT30/BCN photocatalyst is highly stable and does not promote secondary pollution.The catalytic stability of FT30/BCN was further investigated by carrying out the CO 2 reduction under visible light (Figure S9).It can be observed that the high rate of CH 4 evolution is maintained for three cycles i. e 15 h of experiment."}, {"llm generation": "visible light", "source": "FT30/BCN shows 96.3 tetracycline removal (times BCN) in 60 min visible light exposure with high mineralization.", "context": "In summary, FeTiO 2 /BCN heterojunction was prepared by an insitu hydrothermal route by hybridizing FeTiO 2 nanoparticles with thin boron carbon nitride nanosheets.Interestingly, the best performing heterojunction FT30/BCN exhibits superior redox capabilities as inferred from EIS, PL, PCR and band structure analysis.The photocatalyst shows high charge separation, electron transfer capacity and superior photo-current response.FT30/BCN shows 96.3 tetracycline removal (times BCN) in 60 min visible light exposure with high mineralization. In addition, it exhibited 24.7 mol g -1 h -1 CH 4 evolutions with high 91.1 CH 4 selectivity.An effective S-scheme transfer mechanism is active in the heterojunction as confirmed by In-situ XPS, DFT calculations and band structure analysis.The high adsorption potential, high charge separation, high potential VB CB are responsible for high methane selectivity.Also, the selective coordination of CO 2 to form bridging intermediate TiCOO -Ti (via unpaired electron) leads to selective CH 4 formation.In addition, presence of two metal active sites (Fe and Ti) forms Fe-C-O-Ti intermediate which exclusively produces CH 4 by dissociation of C-H bonds via continuous protonation.The effect of CO 2 /H 2 O feed ratio, alkali activation, reducing agents and light source onto CO 2 photo-reduction was also investigated.A TC degradation route was also proposed according to LC-MS analysis and ESR probe (both O 2 -and OH radicals active).The designed FT30/BCN heterojunction exhibits superior structural stability and performance during cycling tests both for TC degradation and CO 2 photoreduction.This work elucidates a robust and well-designed heterojunction photocatalyst with strong redox capacity for meeting the dual demands of water detoxification and solar-to-fuel conversion.

The FeTiO 2 and FeTiO 2 /BCN were prepared by a hydrothermal route.In a typical experiment, an acidic precursor was first prepared by mixing certain amount of sulfuric acid in 100 mL distilled water.In a separate vessel, 10 mL tetrabutyl titanate (Ti(OC 4 H 9 ) 4 ) and a certain amount of Fe(NO 3 ) 3 9H 2 O, was dissolved.The acidic precursor was then slowly added to form a TiO 2 precursor transparent yellow solution.A fixed amount of BCN was then added and sonicated for 30 min.This was then transferred to Teflon lined autoclave and hydrothermally treated at 180 C for 12 h.The obtained powder was then washed several times with water and ethanol and vacuum dried.According to content of FeTiO 2 the samples were labelled as FT10/BCN (10FeTiO 2 /BCN), FT20/BCN, FT30/BCN and FT40/BCN.The dopant content was fixed at 1.5 in FeTiO 2. The whole synthetic route is schematically represented in Fig. 1.The FeTiO 2 was prepared by similar route without the addition of BCN. The phase and structure identification of samples was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) by a Bruker D8 X-ray Diffractometer instrument using Cu K radiation in the range of 20-80 2 variations with a step size of 0.01 s -1 .The surface morphology and shape of materials was examined by observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using Quanta 450FEG, FEI microscope.A Hitachi-600-2 transmission electron microscope (TEM) was used to observe the microstructure of phootocatalysts with electron acceleration energy of 200 kV.The BET surface area via N 2 adsorption isotherms was determined by Tristar 3000 (Micromeritics) analyser at 77 K.For surface area measurements the samples were degassed at 523 K for 4 h under vacuum using nitrogen flux.X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed using Thermo K-Alpha (Thermo Scientific, USA) instrument with monochromatic source (Al K h 1486.6eV) and base pressure of 10-9 torr.For calibration, C 1s peak placed at 284.8 eV binding energy (B.E) was used as reference.The light absorption properties were studied by recording ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflection spectroscopy (UV-vis DRS) with a Lambda 750 (PerkinElmer) instrument.The band gap energies were then calculated using Kubelka-Munk function.Photoluminescence (PL) measurements were done using Edinburgh FLS-1000 fluorescence spectrometer at 350 nm excitation wavelength.The electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra for 5,5-dimethyl-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) trapped OH and O 2 -radicals were recorded on a JEOL JES-FA200 instrument. Fig. 1.Synthesis scheme for FeTiO 2 /BCN heterojunction. The electrochemical and photo-electrochemical experiments were performed on a standard three-electrode electrochemical work station (CHI650E).The three electrodes used for measurements -Platinum electrode as counter, photocatalyst modified electrode as working and Ag/AgCl as reference electrode.For preparing working electrode 4 mg photocatalyst as FT30/BCN is dispered in 20 L Nafion and 2 mL ethanol and sonicated for 2 h.The suspension was then dip-coated on a fluorinedoped tin oxide (FTO) glass (1 cm 2 coated area).The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) experiments were performed in 0.1 M Na 2 SO 4 aqueous solution as electrolyte with frequency from 10 Hz to 100 kHz.The EIS, Nyquist plots were then obtained.The Mott-Schottky (M-S) analysis was further done from capacitance data to calculate the flat band potential (V FB ) (1000 Hz frequency).Further, transient photocurrent response was obtained in similar conditions under 300 W Xe lamp.The electrostatic potentials for (101) face of FeTiO 2 and BCN were calculated by density functional theory (DFT) analysis.DFT calculations to obtain the work functions were performed by Vienna Abinitio Simulation Package (VASP).A Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional is used which is based on the Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA).500 eV cut-off energy was set for structural optimization.3 3 1 K points (BCN) and 3 5 1K points (FeTiO 2 ) were used for Brillouin zone was sampling (Vacuum layer thickness-15 A for BCN and 25 A for FeTiO 2 ).The TiO 2 (1 0 1) model consisted of 24 Ti and 48 O atoms. The photocatalytic degradation of tetracycline was performed in a cylindrical pyrex vessel fixed in a TOPTION photochemical reactor.For visible light source, a 300 W Xe lamp with a filter (400 nm cut off) was used and placed 10 cm from the reaction vessel (Irradiation intensity-202.3 mW cm -2 ).The temperature reaction was controlled at 25 0.5 C via a water circulation arrangement.In a typical experiment, 30 mg of photocatalyst was dispersed in 100 mL of 10 mg L -1 TC solution with constant stirring.The suspension was then exposed to light and residual concentration of TC after regular time intervals was determined using High-performance liquid chromatography with a Agilent 1200 instrument equipped with a C-18 column (250 mm 4.5 mm, 5 m). The mobile phase was a mixture of 20 acetonitrile and 80 phosphate buffer (0.05 M) with 1 mL min -1 flow rate of 1 mL min -1 and 20 L injection volume. The TC degradation intermediates were detected by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry using AB Sciex Triple Quad 5500, LCQ, USI instrument in a positive ionization mode.The mobile phase was acetonitrile and 0.1 HCOOH solution (60:40).The flow rate was set at 0.60 mL min -1 Operation conditions-capillary voltage-4.0kV, N 2 flow rate-10 mL min -1 .The total organic carbon (TOC) was measured using a TOC analyser (TOC-LCPN, Shimadzu Co., Japan). The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O was tested under visible light irradiation (300 W Xe lamp with visible light filter) in a gas-closed circulation system.The photo-reactor was fixed with a 10 mm thick glass window with a lamp at centre and integrated with a concentrator.In a typical experiment, 0.1 g of photocatalyst was dispersed uniformly at the reactor bottom and N 2 gas was purged to remove air from the reaction system.The temperature was controlled at 30 0.5 C by a circulating chiller.Further, high pure CO 2 (99.9) was bubbled through water saturator to carry moisture and circulated into the reactor.The CO 2 flow was maintained at 10 mL min -1 in all the experiments.The CO 2 /H 2 O feed ratio was also by varying the water separator temperature i. e 20 C, 30 C and 40 C. The reducing agents were also varied i. e H 2 O, H 2 and CH 3 OH .For CO H 2 system, CO 2 /H 2 feed ratio was kept as 1.0 before circulating to the reactor.The CO and CH 4 evolution were studied using gas chromatography with a GC-9560 (HuaAiSePu Corp.) instrument equipped with flame ionization detector and thermal conductivity detector (TCD) to quantify.A Carboxen-1010 PLOT GC column was used (L I.D. 30 m 0.51 mm).The selectivity for CH 4 was determined by relation: where S(CH 4 ) is methane selectivity, r-Average gas evolution in 5 h photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.The total electrons consumed for reduction (R e ) are calculated as 3.1.Characterization Fig. 2 (a) shows the XRD patterns of synthesized photocatalysts.The XRD pattern for BCN shows a peak at 26.7 corresponding to graphitic structure of pristine boron carbon nitride which is well matched with ICDD PDF 53-0447.The peak at 43.1 corresponds to the (111) diffraction planes of BCN in sync with ICDD PDF 51-0768) (Chen et al., 2018).For Fe doped TiO 2 , the diffraction peaks corresponding to (110), ( 101), ( 200), ( 111), ( 210), ( 211), ( 220), ( 002), (311), and ( 112) are observed corresponding to tetragonal rutile TiO 2 which is in good agreement with (JCPDS No. 21-1276) (Wang et al., 2015).A slight shift is observed in 2 values as compared to pure rutile TiO 2 from literature because of doping as there is a difference in ionic radii of Fe and Ti.Fe doped TiO 2 is present in single phase without any trace of clusters of Fe as doping of Fe has been done on Ti sites in TiO 2 matrix.As doping content is less than 5 atomic there is no formation of any secondary phase related to Fe.The XRD patterns of binary junction series as FT/BCN show characteristic peaks of both FeTiO 2 and BCN with no extra phases.The peak intensities for BCN are highly reduced in the heterojunction.Change in intensities is observed which is due to variable content of BCN and FeTiO 2 and also due to the crystallinity differences between the two. The specific surface areas for FeTiO 2 and FT30/BCN were calculated as 32.1 m 2 /g and 74.4 m 2 /g, respectively.The adsorption isotherms (Figure S1) belong to typical type-IV isotherm with H3 type hysteresis loop.The mean pore volume and pore size for FeTiO 2 were 0.14 cm 3 /g, and 21.1 nm, respectively.The pore size and pore volume for FT30/BCN were 16.1 nm and 0.23 cm 3 /g, respectively.The surface area is increased on inclusion of BCN into FeTiO 2 which leads to increase in active sites, promoting the photocatalytic activity.The pore volume increased on inclusion of BCN because of improved dispersity of BCN and FeTiO 2 and the re-creation of pores.It is well known that a large surface area and porous structure favour the enhancement of the photocatalytic property via providing more active sites, accelerating the mass transfer or diffusion.The high surface area improves the photon utilization efficiency by providing more exposure and multiple reflections along the pores. The electronic environment, elemental composition and oxidation states of BCN and FT30/BCN were investigated by XPS analysis (Fig. 3).The survey scan (Figure S2) shows the presence of B, C, N in BCN and Fe, Ti, O, B, C, N in the FT30/BCN composite catalyst.In addition the XPS spectra were also obtained for FT30/BCN photocatalyst after visible light illumination to ascertain the binding energy shifts.Fig. 3(a) shows the B1s spectra for BCN and FT30/BCN.The spectra is deconvoluted into two peaks at 189.4 eV (B1) and 190.1 eV (B2) corresponding to B-C and B-N bonds respectively in BCN (Chang et al., 2013).For FT30/BCN heterojunction, in absence of light irradiation, slightly positive shift in B. E is exhibited compared to bare BCN.This signifies that electrons shift from BCN to FeTiO 2 .After light irradiation, a negative shift in B.E signifies, the electrons transfer from FeTiO 2 towards BCN (Kumar et al., 2020a).These findings are supported by C 1s, Ti 2p and O 1s spectra.(Zhou et al., 2018).The B.E exhibits positive shifts in FT30/BCN without light irradiation and negative shift upon illumination.This confirms the electrons shift from BCN towards FeTiO 2 towards on contact and FeTiO 2 to BCN upon illumination.These observations can be further verified from Ti 2p and O 1s spectra.Fig. 3(c) shows the deconvoluted Ti 2p spectra at 459.4 and 465.3 eV, assigned to Ti 2p 3/2 and Ti 2p 1/2 , respectively for Ti 4 oxidation state in TiO 2 (Li et al., 2020b).The peak at 459.9 eV corresponds to Ti 2p 1/2 for Ti 3 oxidation state.Thus both the oxidation states for Ti exist in the material.The Ti 2p spectra for the junction FT30/BCN shows negative shift in binding energies, confirming the electron shift from BCN to FeTiO 2 .Upon illumination B.E for Ti 2p shifts towards higher side, confirming the electron f low from FeTiO 2 towards BCN. The high-resolution O 1s XPS spectra for FT30/BCN (Fig. 3(d)) show three peaks at 528.5, 529.8 and 530.8 eV corresponding to lattice oxygen (metal-O bond), oxygen vacancies, loosely bound O/adsorbed OH groups respectively (Dhiman et al., 2017).The N 1s spectra (Fig. 3(e)) is deconvoluted into three peaks at 399.9, 401.2 and 402.8 eV which can be assigned to N-B, N-C and N-H bonds respectively (Zhou et al., 2020).The Fe 2p spectrum (Fig. 3(e)) shows two peaks at 715.6 and 729.4 eV corresponding 2p 3/2 and 2p 1/2 oxidation states for Fe 2 oxidation state.The peak positioned at 737.3 eV is assigned to 2p 1/2 for Fe 3 oxidation state.The satellite peak at 721.6 eV confirsm the presence of both Fe 2 and Fe 3 oxidation states.The Ti 3 oxidation state in the catalyst exists due to the generation of oxygen vacancies (OVs reduce the Ti 4 ) (Ye et al., 2021).Comparing the Ti 2p and O 1s spectra in FeTiO2 and FT30/BCN we can observe that there are changes in intensities of Ti as well as O 1s.There are changes in oxygen vacancies in the heterojunction as compared to FeTiO2 which will certainly change the intensity of Ti 3 . The B.E shifts confirm that after the contact between FeTiO 2 and BCN to form the FT/BCN heterojunction, there is electron transfer from BCN to FeTiO 2 .This migration is actually caused by difference in Fermi levels of two semiconductors.As BCN has a higher Fermi level than FeTiO 2 (see DFT calculations discussed later) the difference will drive the migration of electrons from BCN to FeTiO 2 until Fermi levels are aligned (Xia et al., 2020).Thus an internal electric field is created at the semiconductors interface.After illumination the band edge positioning and the internal electric field lead to migration of electrons from FeTiO 2 to BCN by an effective S-scheme transfer.The detailed analysis has been discussed in subsequent sections. The morphology and microstructure of BCN and FT30/BCN was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).Fig. 4(a) shows that exfoliated BCN exhibits lamellar sheets like morphology.The low resolution SEM image of FT30/BCN (Fig. 4 b) shows the spherical FeTiO 2 nanoparticles distributed uniformly over the irregular porous sheet of BCN.The high resolution image further shows that the spherical and uniform FeTiO 2 nanoparticles are in intimate contact with BCN sheets (Fig. 4(c)).Further microstructure was ascertained by TEM analysis.The lamellar nanosheets structure of exfoliated BCN can be observed in Fig. 4(d).The TEM image of FT30/BCN (Fig. 4(e)) confirms the uniform distribution of the spherical FeTiO 2 nanoparticles on to the BCN nanosheets.The high intimate contact between the two is surely beneficial for the electron flow and hence the photocatalytic activity.The HRTEM image (Fig. 4(f)) confirms the intimate contact and crystallinity.The lattice fringes of FeTiO 2 can be seen and the data matches with the XRD findings.However, due to poor crystallinity of BCN, it is difficult to observe the lattice fringes for the same.The presence of distributed Ti, O, Fe, B, C and N elements in FT30/BCN is shown in the SEM elemental mapping and corresponding elemental distribution (Fig. 4 g-m).This further demonstrates the close interfacial contact of two components and successful formation of the binary heterojunction. The light absorption properties of BCN, FeTiO 2 and FT30/BCN were characterized by the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-vis DRS) shown in Fig. 5(a).The BCN obviously absorbs in the visible range with absorption edge near 580 nm TiO 2 has a higher band gap with absorption in UV region.However, with 1.5 Fe doping, the absorption edge shows red shift with a better absorption in visible region.The heterojunction FT30/BCN shows a high absorption edge as compared to FeTiO 2 because oof inclusion of low band gap BCN.The increased optical harvesting improves quantum efficiency and photoredox catalysis.The band gap energy (E g ) was caluclated using Kubelka-Munk function (Kumar et al., 2020c).Therefore, the E g values for FeTiO 2 and BCN were estimated to be 2.70 and 2.45 eV, respectively (Fig. 5(b)). The band gap energy for FT30/BCN heterojunction (Figure S3) was found to be 2.57 eV.Further, Mott-Schottky function was utilized to estimate flat band potential (V FB ) as shown in Fig. 5(c-d).The V FB for BCN and FeTiO 2 are found to be 0.1 V and -1.0 V vs NHE respectively. The conduction band edge (E CB ) for an n-type semiconductor (as can be seen in M -S plots that both semiconductors are n-type) is generally 0.1-0.2eV (vs NHE) below the flat band energy (Kumar et al., 2020a). Considering the difference as 0.2 eV, the CB edges are calculated as -1.2 eV and -0.19 eV vs NHE for BCN and FeTiO 2 respectively.Finally, the VB edges (E VB ) were found to be 1.25 eV and 2.51 eV vs NHE for BCN and FeTiO 2 respectively.Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) derived Nyquist plots for BCN, FeTiO 2 and FT30/BCN are shown in Fig. 5(e).Evidently, FT30/BCN exhibits smallest arc radius as compared to bare semiconductors inferring that the heterojunction has lowest charge transfer resistance or highest transfer capacity.The photo-current density (Fig. 5 (f)) of FT30/BCN is significantly enhanced on the junction formation between FeTiO 2 and BCN which is consistent with EIS findings.The high photocurrent response (PCR) of the junction is attributed to higher visible absorption, high charge transfer capacity, reduced recombination and electron aggregation.This was further supported by photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy findings (Fig. 5(g)).The PL intensity falls dramatically in the heterojunction, suggesting that electron-hole recombination is highly diminished.Interestingly, the charge separation improves with increase in content of FeTiO 2 in BCN i. e from FT10/BCN to FT30/BCN.In addition, to elucidate the photo-induced electrons transfer direction and mechanism active at the FeTiO 2 and BCN interface, DFT calculations were employed.The DFT calculation was used to measure the electron density difference between the semiconductors.Fig. 5 (h) shows that FeTiO 2 is a typical oxidation photocatalyst (OP) with a large work function of 6.70 eV.On the other hand, BCN has a lower work function (3.51 eV) (Fig. 5(i)) and is a reduction photocatalyst (RP) quite similar to carbon nitride (Fu et al., 2019).Generally, the Fermi level position is inversely related to the work function.Fig. 9(a-c) shows the electron transfer mechanism in FT/BCN heterojunction.Thus, the Fermi level of BCN is higher than FeTiO 2 Before contact, the CB and VB positioning of FeTiO 2 and BCN shows that they form a staggered arrangement.After contact, the electrons spontaneously migrate from BCN towards FeTiO 2 across their interface until Fermi levels reach equilibrium.The electron output from BCN results in the bending of CB edge upwards.On the contrary, the band edge of FeTiO 2 gets bent downwards because of accumulation of electrons.Hence an internal electric field is set-up.The movement of electrons from BCN leads to formation of internal electric field which further prevents the further migration from BCN to FeTiO 2. On illumination, the electrons and holes get excited in both the semiconductors and the electrons from CB of FeTiO 2 gets migrated to VB of BCN and recombine with holes.This is facilitated by internal electric field and Coulomb interaction.These facts are supported by B.E shifts in XPS findings.The detailed mechanism is discussed in subsequent directions. Systematic tetracycline (TC) photocatalytic degradation experiments were conducted under visible light irradiation using 300 W Xe lamp (with visible light filter).Considering, the adsorption equilibrium, the stirring was performed under dark conditions for 30 min.Figure S4 shows that FT30/BCN shows 87.1 TC removal in 90 min with 31.2 adsorption in dark in 30 min.From 22.1 to 31.1 there is no substantial improvement in adsorption potential as we move from BCN to FT30/ BCN.However, FT30/BCN shows highest adsorption capacity because of high surface area and active sites as also supported by BET adsorption isotherms results.Secondly, under direct exposure, better performance was recorded as can be seen in Fig. 6(a).As shown, after 60 min visible light treatment, the TC removal rates of 45.1, 52.3, 70.1, 85.4, 93.1 and 96.2 were obtained in presence of BCN, FeTiO 2 , FT10/ BCN, FT20/BCN, FT40/BCN and FT30/BCN respectively.There is a substantial improvement in the TC removal rate for FT30/BCN as compared to bare BCN and FeTiO 2 which is due to higher visible capture capacity, reduced recombination and high charge transfer capacity on formation of heterojunction.With increase in content of FeTiO 2 in BCN, the TC degradation increases dramatically, but with very high content i. e 40FeTiO 2 the TC removal decreased.This is attributed to the fact that excess of FeTiO 2 not only hinders the interfacial contact, but also redundant material acts as recombination centres ().The high performance of FT30/BCN is supported by observations from UV-DRS, EIS, PCR and PL measurements.The pseudo-firstorder kinetic analysis for TC degradation is revealed in Fig. 6(b).The plots show that reaction rate for FT30/BCN (k app 0.7123 min -1 ) is nearly 7 times that of bare BCN (0.01246 min -1 ). During the photocatalytic process, pH, presence of electrolytes, water matrix and light source tend to affect the catalyst performance via controlling the surface charge distribution and production of active oxygen species.Fig. 6(c) shows that initial pH has a pronounced effect on the TC degradation by FT30/BCN under visible light.The highest TC removal was found to be 96.2 at pH 5.4 and this was chosen as optimized pH for all the experiments.TC possesses three different pKa values, i. e 3.30, 7.7 and 9.7 (Yi et al., 2020).The pH, pKa and pzc of the catalyst govern the interactions with the TC molecules and also control the strength of hydroxyl and superoxide radical anions in the system.The drug exists as (i) H 4 TC at pH 3.3, (ii) H 3 TC in the pH 3.3-7.7,(iii) H 2 TC -in the pH 7.7-9.7 and (iv) HTC 2-at pH 12.The higher degradation at pH 5.5 could be attributed to the attractive electrostatic force between H 3 TC and FT30/BCN (pzc 7.2).Highly acidic medium limits the adsorption due to repulsive forces and similar behaviour is expected at very high pH.Also, the alkaline medium leads to quenching of OH radicals (Kumar et al., 2020a). Further, effect of some common cations and anions onto TC removal with FT30/BCN catalyst was studied and results are shown in Fig. 6(d).Evidently it can be seen that Cl -and Na ions have no noticeable effect on the photocatalytic efficiency.It's worth mentioning that NO 3 -ions promote in the TC photodegradation (k app 0.07622 min -1 ).This is attributed to the fact that NO 3 -forms excited state on visible light irradiation to form NO 2 and OH which accelerates the TC degradation. On the other hand, HCO 3 -ions have an detrimental effect on TC removal (k app 0.06061 min -1 ) because they consume OH radicals to produce CO 3 -radicals.These radicals are less reactive than hydroxyl radicals and thus the degradation rate falls.The degree of inhibition is higher in case of SO 4 2-ions because they are effective radical scavengers (Tang et al., 2020b).However, Mg 2 showed little inhibitory effect, which may be attributed decrease of pH value and Ca 2 cause inhibition in TC removal because they tend to form co-ordination complexes with the drug molecule (Liu et al., 2020) and similar observations have been found in our previous works too (Kumar et al., 2020a).It is well known that Ca 2 ions form 1:2 ligand:metal complex with TC via chelation (Wessels et al., 1998).As it was observed that inorganic ions have a significant on the TC removal rate, we tested the degradation efficiency in real water system i. e river water, tap water and municipal water (Fig. 6(e)).The water quality parameters are listed in table S1.The TC removal efficiency of 96.2, 93.4, 92.3 and 94.1 in distilled water (DW), Municipal drinking water (MW), tap water (TW) and river water (RW) respectively.Definitely, presence of various ions, natural organic matter etc. leads to variation in the performance in various water matrices.However, it is clearly inferred that FT30/BCN heterojunction has a high potential in practical purification of waste water.Further, the TC degradation efficiency and total organic carbon (TOC) with FT30/BCN catalyst was tested under visible and solar light (Fig. 6(f)).Under natural solar light, 84.1 and 81.2 TC was removed in 60 min in DW and RW respectively.A high mineralization was also reported with 77.2 and 64.3 TOC removal in 2 h under visible and solar light in distilled water.A high TC degradation and TOC removal in river water both under visible light and solar light.This again establishes the findings that FT30/BCN heterojunction has a promising future in real waste water treatment. Radical scavenging experiments were performed to assess the role of reactive oxygen species involved in TC degradation under visible light.Fig. 6(g) shows the effect of 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1oxyl (TEMPOL), isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) as scavengers for et al., 2021).P7 with m/z 384 stemmed from the C-N bond cleavage from P6. P5 with m/z 396 was the by-product of TC methylation.P4 is decomposed into P6 (m/z 413) through the ring-opening process.P6 is continuously oxidized and decomposed to P8 (m/z 256) (ring break and removal of -COOH and -OH groups) and P9 (m/z 218).Further oxidations and decomposition via ring opening leads to formation of simpler moieties with m/Z 159 and 102 (Derikvandi et al., 2021).The intermediates are consistent with reported findings (Tang et al., 2020b).Further oxidation leads to formation of simpler aliphatic molecules and mineralized in longer run into inorganic compounds and gases as supported by high TOC removal findings. A suitable photocatalytic mechanism was predicted on basis of XPS, scavenging experiments, DFT calculations and ESR findings.The ESR DMPO- O 2 -spectrum (Fig. 6(h)) shows high intensity peaks (1:1:1:1) under visible light and no peaks in dark.This suggests that O 2 -radicals are major active species responsible for TC degradation and are present in higher concentration.Also, the DMPO- OH spectrum shows low intensity spectra (1:2:2:1) suggesting a little role of OH radicals in the degradation reaction.These results are supported by scavenging experiments.The thermodynamic feasibility of radical generation can be understood by analysing the band structure.As discussed earlier, from DFT calculations it was found that FeTiO 2 with a higher work function and low fermi level is a typical Oxidation type photocatalyst (OP).On the contrast, BCN has a lower work function with high Fermi level as for a typical reduction photocatalyst (RP).Thus, on contact (Fig. 7(b)) the electrons flow from BCN to FeTiO till Fermi levels align and the built-in electric field further restricts the movement of electrons.However, on exposure, as the electron-holes are produced in BCN and FeTiO 2 , the electrons move from CB of FeTiO towards VB of BCN benefitting from internal electric field, band bending (discussed earlier) and Coulomb interactions.The electrons from CB of FeTiO 2 (-0.19 eV) easily recombine with holes in VB of BCN (1.25 eV).However the recombination of electrons from BCN CB and holes from VB of FeTiO 2 is restrained by internal electric field.Thus a Step scheme (S-scheme) is operational here.The charge transfer in the Sscheme mechanism is shown in Fig. 7(c).Thus, the relatively useless photogenerated electrons in CB of FeTiO 2 (-0.19 eV) because they don't have enough energy for generation of The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O was tested under visible light without using any organic sacrificial reagent.Without use of Scheme 1. Possible degradation route of TC. any catalyst no gases were detected.The two major products detected were CH 4 and CO and traces of CH 3 OH.No or non-detectable hydrogen gas was evolved.Fig. 8 (a) and (b) shows the CO 2 conversion efficiency into CH 4 and CO with time respectively.The pristine BCN exhibits very low photocatalytic efficiency with 30.1 mol g -1 CH 4 evolution in 5 h of visible light irradiation.The sample FT30/BCN shows best photocatalytic performance with 123.2 mol g -1 and 10.3 mol g -1 CH 4 and CO evolution respectively.The cumulative CH 4 and CO evolution showing the selectivity of various samples is shown in Fig. 8(c).The CH 4 evolution follows the order: FT30/BCN (24.7 mol g -1 h -1 ) FT40/ BCN (20.4 mol g -1 h -1 ) FT20/BCN (18.4 mol g -1 h -1 ) FT10/BCN (14.2 mol g -1 h -1 ) FeTiO 2 (9.3 mol g -1 h -1 ) BCN (3.6 mol g -1 h -1 ).Comparing the gas evolution rates, it can be seen that FT30/BCN shows highest CH 4 evolution with 91.1 CH 4 selectivity (poor CO evolution 3.6 mol g -1 h -1 ).The average gas evolution, total electrons consumed in reduction and CH 4 selectivity of all samples is listed in Table 1.Comparing with the single catalyst BCN, it is observed that for BCN CO is evolved in higher amounts than CH 4 .However, CH 4 selectivity is higher in FeTiO 2 , though total efficiency is quite low.FT30/ BCN shows highest CH 4 selectivity.Owing to higher recombination rate and poor charge separation, the CO 2 conversion is poor in single semiconductors.However, on formation of heterojunction, dramatic conversion efficiency and CH 4 selectivity is observed.The performance is enhanced owing to following reasons: Firstly the improved quantum efficiency on junction formation, higher charge separation and effective S-scheme transfer mechanism as discussed in earlier sections.Secondly, the BCN nanosheets allow enough CO 2 adsorption and better binding of CO 2 molecules to the metal ions for higher reduction rate as more active sites ensure higher reduction (He et al., 2020).With the higher charge separation facilitated by built-in electric field in the heterojunction, more electrons are produced with time having high redox capability which brings about high CO 2 photoreduction.As seen in Scheme 2, the CH 4 evolution is an 8H /8e -reaction and CO formation is 2H /2e - reaction.Thus kinetically CO formation is favoured, however, CH 4 evolution is thermodynamically favourable.The thermodynamic and kinetic control thus plays important role in the selectivity (Li et al., 2020a). It has been well documented that hydrogen evolution (via water splitting) often competes with and CO 2 reduction (Li et al., 2012).However, non-detectable i. e extremely low yield, H 2 was evolved during the photocatalytic reaction. Firstly, the CO 2 photo-reduction performance was tested under alkali activation i. e using 0.2 M NaOH solution instead of distilled water.Fig. 8(d) shows the CH 4 evolution in 5 h time course under alkali activation.It can be observed that the CH 4 evolution increased to high extent for each catalyst i. e BCN, FeTiO 2 , FT10/BCN and FT30/BCN.For best performing FT30/BCN photocatalyst, under alkali activation, the CH 4 yield gets nearly doubled from 123.2 mol g -1 to 214.5 mol g -1 .The increase in CH 4 evolution is more prominent in heterojunction than in single semiconductors BCN and FeTiO 2 .The increase in the methane yield with alkali activation is attributed to following reasonsthe presence of alkalinity improves the CO 2 solubility and hydroxyl radical formation.The formation of hydroxyl radicals supports the electron-holes separation and favours CO 2 reduction. The photocatalytic performance of FT30/BCN heterojunction was further tested with variation of initial CO 2 /H 2 O feed ratio and keeping rest of parameters same.During the experiment, when CO 2 is passed through water saturator, the quantity of H 2 O vapors carried by CO 2 is dependent on the water vapour pressure.The high temperature favours more water vapors which makes CO 2 more saturated with H 2 O and thus the CO 2 /H 2 O feed ratio will be low.Conversely, low temperature leads to higher CO 2 /H 2 O feed ratio.The temperature of water saturator was maintained at 20, 30 and 40 C. Thus at 10 C, the feed contains highest CO 2 and at 40 C has lowest CO 2 content.Fig. 8(e) shows the effect of CO 2 /H 2 O feed ratio on photo-reduction of CO 2 under visible light with FT30/BCN.The performance order for CH 4 evolution in 5 h is as follows: 123.2 mol g -1 (30 C) 94.5 mol g -1 (40 C) and 70.2 mol g -1 (20 C).At 10 C (high CO 2 /H 2 O feed ratio) the CH 4 yield is lowest.The production rate increased at 30 C and then declined at 40 C further.At higher CO 2 /H 2 O feed ratio, more CO 2 gets attached to the photocatalyst surface and occupies to more active sites as compared to H 2 O molecules.The quantity of H 2 O molecules will thus not be enough to carry out the oxidation and produce lesser H and also lead to higher recombination.So when temperature is increased to higher temperature 40 C (lower CO 2 /H 2 O feed ratio), more of H 2 O molecules gets attached to catalytic sites and would lower the photocatalytic rate.The best performance is achieved at 30 C when appropriate number of H 2 O and CO 2 molecules gets attached to surface resulting in enough oxidation and reduction reactions with diminished recombination rate.In general higher H 2 O content would favour more CH 4 production, but very high content will hamper the photocatalytic reaction rate (Tahir and Tahir, 2020). Further, we investigated the performance of FT30/BCN composite photocatalyst using different reducing agents (H 2 O, methanol and H 2 ) Fig. 7.The S-scheme heterojunction of FeTiO 2 /BCN (a) before contact, (b) after contact, and (c) after contact upon irradiation and charge migration and separation.and light source (visible and solar light) (Fig. 8 f).Under all the experiments CH 4 and CO were the major products.With CO 2 water system, under visible light as discussed earlier higher CH 4 production (123 mol g -1 ) was obtained.With MeOH (methanol) as reducing agent, high yields of CH 4 (160.2mol g -1 ) and CO (18.6 mol g -1 ) were obtained.The CH 4 evolution under CO 2 MeOH was 1.3 times that of CO 2 H 2 O system.No hydrogen was detected.In CO 2 H 2 system also, appreciable quantity of CH 4 and CO were evolved.But the CO evolution was higher as compared to CH 4 with hydrogen as reducing agent which is consistent with earlier findings (Tahir et al., 2020).With methanol due to more protons (H ) production the CH 4 removal was significantly enhanced.Thus reducing agents have a pronounced effect on CO 2 conversion efficiency and CH 4 selectivity.Under solar light CO 2 H 2 O system a high CH 4 evolution 98.7 mol g -1 in 5 h is obtained with high selectivity.Thus, FT30/BCN photocatalyst is capable of efficient solar-to-fuel conversion with high selectivity and promising in real fuel production applications. As discussed earlier, the CH 4 evolution is an 8e -/8H reaction progressed by multiple steps and also via a multiple proton-coupled electron transfer route for high methane selectivity.With the progress of photocatalytic reaction, more photogenerated electrons are produced.Because of an effective S-scheme transfer between FeTiO 2 and BCN a high electron-holes separation is ensured.The FT30/BCN photocatalyst shows high charge transfer capacity, photocurrent response and highly diminished electron-hole recombination.Thus more electrons are available for high and selective CH 4 production.The pzc of the photocatalyst is 7.2 and thus slightly basic characteristics favour more CO 2 adsorption and hydrogenation too.Secondly it can be explained in The average gas evolution rates and CH 4 selectivity for various samples under visible light. Gas evolution (mol g another way that because of presence of RGO basic characteristics are induced on surface of ABR catalyst as pzc is 7.4, CO 2 adsorption and hydrogenation is favoured.The conversion of CO 2 into CO is a more favoured step involving 2H / 2e -mechanism.The S-scheme transfer mechanism which has already been discussed in previous sections saves the electrons and holes in high potential conduction band and valence band respectively.The redox potential for E o (CO/CO 2 ) -0.42eV and E o (CH 4 /CO 2 ) -0.24eV.The electrons accumulated in CB of BCN (-1.2 eV) are capable of for reducing CO 2 to CH 4 by route involving by single step multi electron transfer with proton coupling.The holes accumulated in VB of FeTiO 2 (2.51 eV) have high potential to produce protons from water.Thus the higher charge separation and availability of high potential electrons favour the high conversion efficiency and CH 4 selectivity.Also the short diffusion length of thin exfoliated BCN nanosheets generates more electrons on visible light exposure and favours CH 4 production.As seen in O 1s XPS spectrum in FT30/BCN, there are numerous O vacancies on the surface which trap electrons generated by BCN and FeTiO 2 and boost the photocatalytic activity.Furthermore, isotope experiment with 13 CO 2 and 12 CO 2 were performed for visible light CO 2 H 2 O FT30/BCN system (Figure S5).The existence of peaks at m/z 16 and m/z 17 for CH 4 shows that reduction products are reduced from the CO 2 and not by any other reaction or route. We have also predicted two more mechanisms for high CH 4 selectivity with FT30/BCN catalyst as shown in Fig. 9.It has been reported earlier also that selectivity can be increased via coordination activation.As seen in Ti 2p XPS spectrum, Ti 3 is present on TiO 2 surface and will act as an active site with presence of unpaired electrons.The CO 2 molecules get adsorbed onto photocatalyst via coordination to lewis base site i. e Ti 3 for instance (Sree et al., 2009).As seen in Fig. 9(a), The bridging TiCOO -Ti will be formed on TiO 2 sites located uniformly on thin BCN nanosheets.The adsorbed CO 2 molecules can interact with Ti 3 (as shown in Figure ) via an interfacial charge transfer mechanism thereby decreasing the required activation energy.On exposure to light, the 2 photo-generated electrons will transfer to the co-ordinated CO 2 molecules i. e TiC.Simultaneously, the H (protons) get connected into TiCOO -Ti via electrostatic forces of attraction to form TiHCOO -Ti intermediate as reported in a related previous work (Wang et al., 2021).This intermediate further gets converted into TiHCHO -Ti and TiCH 3 O -Ti which via further protonation and electron transfer (shown in Fig. 9(a)) leads to detachment of CH 4 molecule from catalyst surface.On the other hand, the holes (h ) would generate hydroxyl radicals.This explains the highly selective CH 4 formation.Fig. 9(b) shows the other way for CH 4 formation.The presence of FeTiO 2 facilitates two metal sites on to FT30/BCN heterojunction photcatalyst.Thus, Fe and Ti both can bond concurrently with C and O atoms (in CO 2 -as shown in figure)to form Fe-C-O-Ti i. e M 1 -C-O-M 2 reaction intermediate which favours only CH 4 formation.This is attributed to the fact that it is not easy to break both M 1 -C and M 2 -O bonds simultaneously.On the contrast, it's rather easy to dissociate C-H bonds via continuous protonation which weakens the M 1 -C and M 2 -O bonds simultaneously and produce CH 4 (Jiao et al., 2020). The in-situ XPS characterization, DFT analysis, scavenging experiments probe and band structure analysis predicts an exclusive S-scheme electron transfer mechanism for efficient electron separation and charge transfer capacity for efficient CO 2 reduction. The stability and reusability of the photocatalyst FT30/BCN was tested both for photocatalytic TC degradation and CO 2 reduction.Figure S6 shows that there is no abnormal loss in the activity of FT30/ BCN for TC degradation under visible light.A negligible fall in the TC removal rate was observed.The XRD pattern and SEM micrograph of FT30/BCN (Figure S7) obtained after reuse and recovery shows there is no change the structure and morphology.Thus catalyst is robust, highly stable and recyclable.Further, metal leaching tests were performed for Fe and Ti using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) (Agilent 8800 ICP-QQQ).Figure S8 shows that at pH 2 minor leaching rates were observed for Fe (0.03) and Ti (0.027).The leaching rates are negligible at pH 4.The ultra-low/negligible leaching shows the FT30/BCN photocatalyst is highly stable and does not promote secondary pollution.The catalytic stability of FT30/BCN was further investigated by carrying out the CO 2 reduction under visible light (Figure S9).It can be observed that the high rate of CH 4 evolution is maintained for three cycles i. e 15 h of experiment. In summary, FeTiO 2 /BCN heterojunction was prepared by an insitu hydrothermal route by hybridizing FeTiO 2 nanoparticles with thin boron carbon nitride nanosheets.Interestingly, the best performing heterojunction FT30/BCN exhibits superior redox capabilities as inferred from EIS, PL, PCR and band structure analysis.The photocatalyst shows high charge separation, electron transfer capacity and superior photo-current response.FT30/BCN shows 96.3 tetracycline removal (times BCN) in 60 min visible light exposure with high mineralization. In addition, it exhibited 24.7 mol g -1 h -1 CH 4 evolutions with high 91.1 CH 4 selectivity.An effective S-scheme transfer mechanism is active in the heterojunction as confirmed by In-situ XPS, DFT calculations and band structure analysis.The high adsorption potential, high charge separation, high potential VB CB are responsible for high methane selectivity.Also, the selective coordination of CO 2 to form bridging intermediate TiCOO -Ti (via unpaired electron) leads to selective CH 4 formation.In addition, presence of two metal active sites (Fe and Ti) forms Fe-C-O-Ti intermediate which exclusively produces CH 4 by dissociation of C-H bonds via continuous protonation.The effect of CO 2 /H 2 O feed ratio, alkali activation, reducing agents and light source onto CO 2 photo-reduction was also investigated.A TC degradation route was also proposed according to LC-MS analysis and ESR probe (both O 2 -and OH radicals active).The designed FT30/BCN heterojunction exhibits superior structural stability and performance during cycling tests both for TC degradation and CO 2 photoreduction.This work elucidates a robust and well-designed heterojunction photocatalyst with strong redox capacity for meeting the dual demands of water detoxification and solar-to-fuel conversion.

The specific surface areas for FeTiO 2 and FT30/BCN were calculated as 32.1 m 2 /g and 74.4 m 2 /g, respectively.The adsorption isotherms (Figure S1) belong to typical type-IV isotherm with H3 type hysteresis loop.The mean pore volume and pore size for FeTiO 2 were 0.14 cm 3 /g, and 21.1 nm, respectively.The pore size and pore volume for FT30/BCN were 16.1 nm and 0.23 cm 3 /g, respectively.The surface area is increased on inclusion of BCN into FeTiO 2 which leads to increase in active sites, promoting the photocatalytic activity.The pore volume increased on inclusion of BCN because of improved dispersity of BCN and FeTiO 2 and the re-creation of pores.It is well known that a large surface area and porous structure favour the enhancement of the photocatalytic property via providing more active sites, accelerating the mass transfer or diffusion.The high surface area improves the photon utilization efficiency by providing more exposure and multiple reflections along the pores. The electronic environment, elemental composition and oxidation states of BCN and FT30/BCN were investigated by XPS analysis (Fig. 3).The survey scan (Figure S2) shows the presence of B, C, N in BCN and Fe, Ti, O, B, C, N in the FT30/BCN composite catalyst.In addition the XPS spectra were also obtained for FT30/BCN photocatalyst after visible light illumination to ascertain the binding energy shifts.Fig. 3(a) shows the B1s spectra for BCN and FT30/BCN.The spectra is deconvoluted into two peaks at 189.4 eV (B1) and 190.1 eV (B2) corresponding to B-C and B-N bonds respectively in BCN (Chang et al., 2013).For FT30/BCN heterojunction, in absence of light irradiation, slightly positive shift in B. E is exhibited compared to bare BCN.This signifies that electrons shift from BCN to FeTiO 2 .After light irradiation, a negative shift in B.E signifies, the electrons transfer from FeTiO 2 towards BCN (Kumar et al., 2020a).These findings are supported by C 1s, Ti 2p and O 1s spectra.(Zhou et al., 2018).The B.E exhibits positive shifts in FT30/BCN without light irradiation and negative shift upon illumination.This confirms the electrons shift from BCN towards FeTiO 2 towards on contact and FeTiO 2 to BCN upon illumination.These observations can be further verified from Ti 2p and O 1s spectra.Fig. 3(c) shows the deconvoluted Ti 2p spectra at 459.4 and 465.3 eV, assigned to Ti 2p 3/2 and Ti 2p 1/2 , respectively for Ti 4 oxidation state in TiO 2 (Li et al., 2020b).The peak at 459.9 eV corresponds to Ti 2p 1/2 for Ti 3 oxidation state.Thus both the oxidation states for Ti exist in the material.The Ti 2p spectra for the junction FT30/BCN shows negative shift in binding energies, confirming the electron shift from BCN to FeTiO 2 .Upon illumination B.E for Ti 2p shifts towards higher side, confirming the electron f low from FeTiO 2 towards BCN. The high-resolution O 1s XPS spectra for FT30/BCN (Fig. 3(d)) show three peaks at 528.5, 529.8 and 530.8 eV corresponding to lattice oxygen (metal-O bond), oxygen vacancies, loosely bound O/adsorbed OH groups respectively (Dhiman et al., 2017).The N 1s spectra (Fig. 3(e)) is deconvoluted into three peaks at 399.9, 401.2 and 402.8 eV which can be assigned to N-B, N-C and N-H bonds respectively (Zhou et al., 2020).The Fe 2p spectrum (Fig. 3(e)) shows two peaks at 715.6 and 729.4 eV corresponding 2p 3/2 and 2p 1/2 oxidation states for Fe 2 oxidation state.The peak positioned at 737.3 eV is assigned to 2p 1/2 for Fe 3 oxidation state.The satellite peak at 721.6 eV confirsm the presence of both Fe 2 and Fe 3 oxidation states.The Ti 3 oxidation state in the catalyst exists due to the generation of oxygen vacancies (OVs reduce the Ti 4 ) (Ye et al., 2021).Comparing the Ti 2p and O 1s spectra in FeTiO2 and FT30/BCN we can observe that there are changes in intensities of Ti as well as O 1s.There are changes in oxygen vacancies in the heterojunction as compared to FeTiO2 which will certainly change the intensity of Ti 3 . The B.E shifts confirm that after the contact between FeTiO 2 and BCN to form the FT/BCN heterojunction, there is electron transfer from BCN to FeTiO 2 .This migration is actually caused by difference in Fermi levels of two semiconductors.As BCN has a higher Fermi level than FeTiO 2 (see DFT calculations discussed later) the difference will drive the migration of electrons from BCN to FeTiO 2 until Fermi levels are aligned (Xia et al., 2020).Thus an internal electric field is created at the semiconductors interface.After illumination the band edge positioning and the internal electric field lead to migration of electrons from FeTiO 2 to BCN by an effective S-scheme transfer.The detailed analysis has been discussed in subsequent sections. The morphology and microstructure of BCN and FT30/BCN was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).Fig. 4(a) shows that exfoliated BCN exhibits lamellar sheets like morphology.The low resolution SEM image of FT30/BCN (Fig. 4 b) shows the spherical FeTiO 2 nanoparticles distributed uniformly over the irregular porous sheet of BCN.The high resolution image further shows that the spherical and uniform FeTiO 2 nanoparticles are in intimate contact with BCN sheets (Fig. 4(c)).Further microstructure was ascertained by TEM analysis.The lamellar nanosheets structure of exfoliated BCN can be observed in Fig. 4(d).The TEM image of FT30/BCN (Fig. 4(e)) confirms the uniform distribution of the spherical FeTiO 2 nanoparticles on to the BCN nanosheets.The high intimate contact between the two is surely beneficial for the electron flow and hence the photocatalytic activity.The HRTEM image (Fig. 4(f)) confirms the intimate contact and crystallinity.The lattice fringes of FeTiO 2 can be seen and the data matches with the XRD findings.However, due to poor crystallinity of BCN, it is difficult to observe the lattice fringes for the same.The presence of distributed Ti, O, Fe, B, C and N elements in FT30/BCN is shown in the SEM elemental mapping and corresponding elemental distribution (Fig. 4 g-m).This further demonstrates the close interfacial contact of two components and successful formation of the binary heterojunction. The light absorption properties of BCN, FeTiO 2 and FT30/BCN were characterized by the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-vis DRS) shown in Fig. 5(a).The BCN obviously absorbs in the visible range with absorption edge near 580 nm TiO 2 has a higher band gap with absorption in UV region.However, with 1.5 Fe doping, the absorption edge shows red shift with a better absorption in visible region.The heterojunction FT30/BCN shows a high absorption edge as compared to FeTiO 2 because oof inclusion of low band gap BCN.The increased optical harvesting improves quantum efficiency and photoredox catalysis.The band gap energy (E g ) was caluclated using Kubelka-Munk function (Kumar et al., 2020c).Therefore, the E g values for FeTiO 2 and BCN were estimated to be 2.70 and 2.45 eV, respectively (Fig. 5(b)). The band gap energy for FT30/BCN heterojunction (Figure S3) was found to be 2.57 eV.Further, Mott-Schottky function was utilized to estimate flat band potential (V FB ) as shown in Fig. 5(c-d).The V FB for BCN and FeTiO 2 are found to be 0.1 V and -1.0 V vs NHE respectively. The conduction band edge (E CB ) for an n-type semiconductor (as can be seen in M -S plots that both semiconductors are n-type) is generally 0.1-0.2eV (vs NHE) below the flat band energy (Kumar et al., 2020a). Considering the difference as 0.2 eV, the CB edges are calculated as -1.2 eV and -0.19 eV vs NHE for BCN and FeTiO 2 respectively.Finally, the VB edges (E VB ) were found to be 1.25 eV and 2.51 eV vs NHE for BCN and FeTiO 2 respectively.Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) derived Nyquist plots for BCN, FeTiO 2 and FT30/BCN are shown in Fig. 5(e).Evidently, FT30/BCN exhibits smallest arc radius as compared to bare semiconductors inferring that the heterojunction has lowest charge transfer resistance or highest transfer capacity.The photo-current density (Fig. 5 (f)) of FT30/BCN is significantly enhanced on the junction formation between FeTiO 2 and BCN which is consistent with EIS findings.The high photocurrent response (PCR) of the junction is attributed to higher visible absorption, high charge transfer capacity, reduced recombination and electron aggregation.This was further supported by photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy findings (Fig. 5(g)).The PL intensity falls dramatically in the heterojunction, suggesting that electron-hole recombination is highly diminished.Interestingly, the charge separation improves with increase in content of FeTiO 2 in BCN i. e from FT10/BCN to FT30/BCN.In addition, to elucidate the photo-induced electrons transfer direction and mechanism active at the FeTiO 2 and BCN interface, DFT calculations were employed.The DFT calculation was used to measure the electron density difference between the semiconductors.Fig. 5 (h) shows that FeTiO 2 is a typical oxidation photocatalyst (OP) with a large work function of 6.70 eV.On the other hand, BCN has a lower work function (3.51 eV) (Fig. 5(i)) and is a reduction photocatalyst (RP) quite similar to carbon nitride (Fu et al., 2019).Generally, the Fermi level position is inversely related to the work function.Fig. 9(a-c) shows the electron transfer mechanism in FT/BCN heterojunction.Thus, the Fermi level of BCN is higher than FeTiO 2 Before contact, the CB and VB positioning of FeTiO 2 and BCN shows that they form a staggered arrangement.After contact, the electrons spontaneously migrate from BCN towards FeTiO 2 across their interface until Fermi levels reach equilibrium.The electron output from BCN results in the bending of CB edge upwards.On the contrary, the band edge of FeTiO 2 gets bent downwards because of accumulation of electrons.Hence an internal electric field is set-up.The movement of electrons from BCN leads to formation of internal electric field which further prevents the further migration from BCN to FeTiO 2. On illumination, the electrons and holes get excited in both the semiconductors and the electrons from CB of FeTiO 2 gets migrated to VB of BCN and recombine with holes.This is facilitated by internal electric field and Coulomb interaction.These facts are supported by B.E shifts in XPS findings.The detailed mechanism is discussed in subsequent directions. Systematic tetracycline (TC) photocatalytic degradation experiments were conducted under visible light irradiation using 300 W Xe lamp (with visible light filter).Considering, the adsorption equilibrium, the stirring was performed under dark conditions for 30 min.Figure S4 shows that FT30/BCN shows 87.1 TC removal in 90 min with 31.2 adsorption in dark in 30 min.From 22.1 to 31.1 there is no substantial improvement in adsorption potential as we move from BCN to FT30/ BCN.However, FT30/BCN shows highest adsorption capacity because of high surface area and active sites as also supported by BET adsorption isotherms results.Secondly, under direct exposure, better performance was recorded as can be seen in Fig. 6(a).As shown, after 60 min visible light treatment, the TC removal rates of 45.1, 52.3, 70.1, 85.4, 93.1 and 96.2 were obtained in presence of BCN, FeTiO 2 , FT10/ BCN, FT20/BCN, FT40/BCN and FT30/BCN respectively.There is a substantial improvement in the TC removal rate for FT30/BCN as compared to bare BCN and FeTiO 2 which is due to higher visible capture capacity, reduced recombination and high charge transfer capacity on formation of heterojunction.With increase in content of FeTiO 2 in BCN, the TC degradation increases dramatically, but with very high content i. e 40FeTiO 2 the TC removal decreased.This is attributed to the fact that excess of FeTiO 2 not only hinders the interfacial contact, but also redundant material acts as recombination centres ().The high performance of FT30/BCN is supported by observations from UV-DRS, EIS, PCR and PL measurements.The pseudo-firstorder kinetic analysis for TC degradation is revealed in Fig. 6(b).The plots show that reaction rate for FT30/BCN (k app 0.7123 min -1 ) is nearly 7 times that of bare BCN (0.01246 min -1 ). During the photocatalytic process, pH, presence of electrolytes, water matrix and light source tend to affect the catalyst performance via controlling the surface charge distribution and production of active oxygen species.Fig. 6(c) shows that initial pH has a pronounced effect on the TC degradation by FT30/BCN under visible light.The highest TC removal was found to be 96.2 at pH 5.4 and this was chosen as optimized pH for all the experiments.TC possesses three different pKa values, i. e 3.30, 7.7 and 9.7 (Yi et al., 2020).The pH, pKa and pzc of the catalyst govern the interactions with the TC molecules and also control the strength of hydroxyl and superoxide radical anions in the system.The drug exists as (i) H 4 TC at pH 3.3, (ii) H 3 TC in the pH 3.3-7.7,(iii) H 2 TC -in the pH 7.7-9.7 and (iv) HTC 2-at pH 12.The higher degradation at pH 5.5 could be attributed to the attractive electrostatic force between H 3 TC and FT30/BCN (pzc 7.2).Highly acidic medium limits the adsorption due to repulsive forces and similar behaviour is expected at very high pH.Also, the alkaline medium leads to quenching of OH radicals (Kumar et al., 2020a). Further, effect of some common cations and anions onto TC removal with FT30/BCN catalyst was studied and results are shown in Fig. 6(d).Evidently it can be seen that Cl -and Na ions have no noticeable effect on the photocatalytic efficiency.It's worth mentioning that NO 3 -ions promote in the TC photodegradation (k app 0.07622 min -1 ).This is attributed to the fact that NO 3 -forms excited state on visible light irradiation to form NO 2 and OH which accelerates the TC degradation. On the other hand, HCO 3 -ions have an detrimental effect on TC removal (k app 0.06061 min -1 ) because they consume OH radicals to produce CO 3 -radicals.These radicals are less reactive than hydroxyl radicals and thus the degradation rate falls.The degree of inhibition is higher in case of SO 4 2-ions because they are effective radical scavengers (Tang et al., 2020b).However, Mg 2 showed little inhibitory effect, which may be attributed decrease of pH value and Ca 2 cause inhibition in TC removal because they tend to form co-ordination complexes with the drug molecule (Liu et al., 2020) and similar observations have been found in our previous works too (Kumar et al., 2020a).It is well known that Ca 2 ions form 1:2 ligand:metal complex with TC via chelation (Wessels et al., 1998).As it was observed that inorganic ions have a significant on the TC removal rate, we tested the degradation efficiency in real water system i. e river water, tap water and municipal water (Fig. 6(e)).The water quality parameters are listed in table S1.The TC removal efficiency of 96.2, 93.4, 92.3 and 94.1 in distilled water (DW), Municipal drinking water (MW), tap water (TW) and river water (RW) respectively.Definitely, presence of various ions, natural organic matter etc. leads to variation in the performance in various water matrices.However, it is clearly inferred that FT30/BCN heterojunction has a high potential in practical purification of waste water.Further, the TC degradation efficiency and total organic carbon (TOC) with FT30/BCN catalyst was tested under visible and solar light (Fig. 6(f)).Under natural solar light, 84.1 and 81.2 TC was removed in 60 min in DW and RW respectively.A high mineralization was also reported with 77.2 and 64.3 TOC removal in 2 h under visible and solar light in distilled water.A high TC degradation and TOC removal in river water both under visible light and solar light.This again establishes the findings that FT30/BCN heterojunction has a promising future in real waste water treatment. Radical scavenging experiments were performed to assess the role of reactive oxygen species involved in TC degradation under visible light.Fig. 6(g) shows the effect of 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1oxyl (TEMPOL), isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) as scavengers for et al., 2021).P7 with m/z 384 stemmed from the C-N bond cleavage from P6. P5 with m/z 396 was the by-product of TC methylation.P4 is decomposed into P6 (m/z 413) through the ring-opening process.P6 is continuously oxidized and decomposed to P8 (m/z 256) (ring break and removal of -COOH and -OH groups) and P9 (m/z 218).Further oxidations and decomposition via ring opening leads to formation of simpler moieties with m/Z 159 and 102 (Derikvandi et al., 2021).The intermediates are consistent with reported findings (Tang et al., 2020b).Further oxidation leads to formation of simpler aliphatic molecules and mineralized in longer run into inorganic compounds and gases as supported by high TOC removal findings. A suitable photocatalytic mechanism was predicted on basis of XPS, scavenging experiments, DFT calculations and ESR findings.The ESR DMPO- O 2 -spectrum (Fig. 6(h)) shows high intensity peaks (1:1:1:1) under visible light and no peaks in dark.This suggests that O 2 -radicals are major active species responsible for TC degradation and are present in higher concentration.Also, the DMPO- OH spectrum shows low intensity spectra (1:2:2:1) suggesting a little role of OH radicals in the degradation reaction.These results are supported by scavenging experiments.The thermodynamic feasibility of radical generation can be understood by analysing the band structure.As discussed earlier, from DFT calculations it was found that FeTiO 2 with a higher work function and low fermi level is a typical Oxidation type photocatalyst (OP).On the contrast, BCN has a lower work function with high Fermi level as for a typical reduction photocatalyst (RP).Thus, on contact (Fig. 7(b)) the electrons flow from BCN to FeTiO till Fermi levels align and the built-in electric field further restricts the movement of electrons.However, on exposure, as the electron-holes are produced in BCN and FeTiO 2 , the electrons move from CB of FeTiO towards VB of BCN benefitting from internal electric field, band bending (discussed earlier) and Coulomb interactions.The electrons from CB of FeTiO 2 (-0.19 eV) easily recombine with holes in VB of BCN (1.25 eV).However the recombination of electrons from BCN CB and holes from VB of FeTiO 2 is restrained by internal electric field.Thus a Step scheme (S-scheme) is operational here.The charge transfer in the Sscheme mechanism is shown in Fig. 7(c).Thus, the relatively useless photogenerated electrons in CB of FeTiO 2 (-0.19 eV) because they don't have enough energy for generation of The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O was tested under visible light without using any organic sacrificial reagent.Without use of Scheme 1. Possible degradation route of TC. any catalyst no gases were detected.The two major products detected were CH 4 and CO and traces of CH 3 OH.No or non-detectable hydrogen gas was evolved.Fig. 8 (a) and (b) shows the CO 2 conversion efficiency into CH 4 and CO with time respectively.The pristine BCN exhibits very low photocatalytic efficiency with 30.1 mol g -1 CH 4 evolution in 5 h of visible light irradiation.The sample FT30/BCN shows best photocatalytic performance with 123.2 mol g -1 and 10.3 mol g -1 CH 4 and CO evolution respectively.The cumulative CH 4 and CO evolution showing the selectivity of various samples is shown in Fig. 8(c).The CH 4 evolution follows the order: FT30/BCN (24.7 mol g -1 h -1 ) FT40/ BCN (20.4 mol g -1 h -1 ) FT20/BCN (18.4 mol g -1 h -1 ) FT10/BCN (14.2 mol g -1 h -1 ) FeTiO 2 (9.3 mol g -1 h -1 ) BCN (3.6 mol g -1 h -1 ).Comparing the gas evolution rates, it can be seen that FT30/BCN shows highest CH 4 evolution with 91.1 CH 4 selectivity (poor CO evolution 3.6 mol g -1 h -1 ).The average gas evolution, total electrons consumed in reduction and CH 4 selectivity of all samples is listed in Table 1.Comparing with the single catalyst BCN, it is observed that for BCN CO is evolved in higher amounts than CH 4 .However, CH 4 selectivity is higher in FeTiO 2 , though total efficiency is quite low.FT30/ BCN shows highest CH 4 selectivity.Owing to higher recombination rate and poor charge separation, the CO 2 conversion is poor in single semiconductors.However, on formation of heterojunction, dramatic conversion efficiency and CH 4 selectivity is observed.The performance is enhanced owing to following reasons: Firstly the improved quantum efficiency on junction formation, higher charge separation and effective S-scheme transfer mechanism as discussed in earlier sections.Secondly, the BCN nanosheets allow enough CO 2 adsorption and better binding of CO 2 molecules to the metal ions for higher reduction rate as more active sites ensure higher reduction (He et al., 2020).With the higher charge separation facilitated by built-in electric field in the heterojunction, more electrons are produced with time having high redox capability which brings about high CO 2 photoreduction.As seen in Scheme 2, the CH 4 evolution is an 8H /8e -reaction and CO formation is 2H /2e - reaction.Thus kinetically CO formation is favoured, however, CH 4 evolution is thermodynamically favourable.The thermodynamic and kinetic control thus plays important role in the selectivity (Li et al., 2020a). It has been well documented that hydrogen evolution (via water splitting) often competes with and CO 2 reduction (Li et al., 2012).However, non-detectable i. e extremely low yield, H 2 was evolved during the photocatalytic reaction. Firstly, the CO 2 photo-reduction performance was tested under alkali activation i. e using 0.2 M NaOH solution instead of distilled water.Fig. 8(d) shows the CH 4 evolution in 5 h time course under alkali activation.It can be observed that the CH 4 evolution increased to high extent for each catalyst i. e BCN, FeTiO 2 , FT10/BCN and FT30/BCN.For best performing FT30/BCN photocatalyst, under alkali activation, the CH 4 yield gets nearly doubled from 123.2 mol g -1 to 214.5 mol g -1 .The increase in CH 4 evolution is more prominent in heterojunction than in single semiconductors BCN and FeTiO 2 .The increase in the methane yield with alkali activation is attributed to following reasonsthe presence of alkalinity improves the CO 2 solubility and hydroxyl radical formation.The formation of hydroxyl radicals supports the electron-holes separation and favours CO 2 reduction. The photocatalytic performance of FT30/BCN heterojunction was further tested with variation of initial CO 2 /H 2 O feed ratio and keeping rest of parameters same.During the experiment, when CO 2 is passed through water saturator, the quantity of H 2 O vapors carried by CO 2 is dependent on the water vapour pressure.The high temperature favours more water vapors which makes CO 2 more saturated with H 2 O and thus the CO 2 /H 2 O feed ratio will be low.Conversely, low temperature leads to higher CO 2 /H 2 O feed ratio.The temperature of water saturator was maintained at 20, 30 and 40 C. Thus at 10 C, the feed contains highest CO 2 and at 40 C has lowest CO 2 content.Fig. 8(e) shows the effect of CO 2 /H 2 O feed ratio on photo-reduction of CO 2 under visible light with FT30/BCN.The performance order for CH 4 evolution in 5 h is as follows: 123.2 mol g -1 (30 C) 94.5 mol g -1 (40 C) and 70.2 mol g -1 (20 C).At 10 C (high CO 2 /H 2 O feed ratio) the CH 4 yield is lowest.The production rate increased at 30 C and then declined at 40 C further.At higher CO 2 /H 2 O feed ratio, more CO 2 gets attached to the photocatalyst surface and occupies to more active sites as compared to H 2 O molecules.The quantity of H 2 O molecules will thus not be enough to carry out the oxidation and produce lesser H and also lead to higher recombination.So when temperature is increased to higher temperature 40 C (lower CO 2 /H 2 O feed ratio), more of H 2 O molecules gets attached to catalytic sites and would lower the photocatalytic rate.The best performance is achieved at 30 C when appropriate number of H 2 O and CO 2 molecules gets attached to surface resulting in enough oxidation and reduction reactions with diminished recombination rate.In general higher H 2 O content would favour more CH 4 production, but very high content will hamper the photocatalytic reaction rate (Tahir and Tahir, 2020). Further, we investigated the performance of FT30/BCN composite photocatalyst using different reducing agents (H 2 O, methanol and H 2 ) Fig. 7.The S-scheme heterojunction of FeTiO 2 /BCN (a) before contact, (b) after contact, and (c) after contact upon irradiation and charge migration and separation.and light source (visible and solar light) (Fig. 8 f).Under all the experiments CH 4 and CO were the major products.With CO 2 water system, under visible light as discussed earlier higher CH 4 production (123 mol g -1 ) was obtained.With MeOH (methanol) as reducing agent, high yields of CH 4 (160.2mol g -1 ) and CO (18.6 mol g -1 ) were obtained.The CH 4 evolution under CO 2 MeOH was 1.3 times that of CO 2 H 2 O system.No hydrogen was detected.In CO 2 H 2 system also, appreciable quantity of CH 4 and CO were evolved.But the CO evolution was higher as compared to CH 4 with hydrogen as reducing agent which is consistent with earlier findings (Tahir et al., 2020).With methanol due to more protons (H ) production the CH 4 removal was significantly enhanced.Thus reducing agents have a pronounced effect on CO 2 conversion efficiency and CH 4 selectivity.Under solar light CO 2 H 2 O system a high CH 4 evolution 98.7 mol g -1 in 5 h is obtained with high selectivity.Thus, FT30/BCN photocatalyst is capable of efficient solar-to-fuel conversion with high selectivity and promising in real fuel production applications. As discussed earlier, the CH 4 evolution is an 8e -/8H reaction progressed by multiple steps and also via a multiple proton-coupled electron transfer route for high methane selectivity.With the progress of photocatalytic reaction, more photogenerated electrons are produced.Because of an effective S-scheme transfer between FeTiO 2 and BCN a high electron-holes separation is ensured.The FT30/BCN photocatalyst shows high charge transfer capacity, photocurrent response and highly diminished electron-hole recombination.Thus more electrons are available for high and selective CH 4 production.The pzc of the photocatalyst is 7.2 and thus slightly basic characteristics favour more CO 2 adsorption and hydrogenation too.Secondly it can be explained in The average gas evolution rates and CH 4 selectivity for various samples under visible light. Gas evolution (mol g another way that because of presence of RGO basic characteristics are induced on surface of ABR catalyst as pzc is 7.4, CO 2 adsorption and hydrogenation is favoured.The conversion of CO 2 into CO is a more favoured step involving 2H / 2e -mechanism.The S-scheme transfer mechanism which has already been discussed in previous sections saves the electrons and holes in high potential conduction band and valence band respectively.The redox potential for E o (CO/CO 2 ) -0.42eV and E o (CH 4 /CO 2 ) -0.24eV.The electrons accumulated in CB of BCN (-1.2 eV) are capable of for reducing CO 2 to CH 4 by route involving by single step multi electron transfer with proton coupling.The holes accumulated in VB of FeTiO 2 (2.51 eV) have high potential to produce protons from water.Thus the higher charge separation and availability of high potential electrons favour the high conversion efficiency and CH 4 selectivity.Also the short diffusion length of thin exfoliated BCN nanosheets generates more electrons on visible light exposure and favours CH 4 production.As seen in O 1s XPS spectrum in FT30/BCN, there are numerous O vacancies on the surface which trap electrons generated by BCN and FeTiO 2 and boost the photocatalytic activity.Furthermore, isotope experiment with 13 CO 2 and 12 CO 2 were performed for visible light CO 2 H 2 O FT30/BCN system (Figure S5).The existence of peaks at m/z 16 and m/z 17 for CH 4 shows that reduction products are reduced from the CO 2 and not by any other reaction or route. We have also predicted two more mechanisms for high CH 4 selectivity with FT30/BCN catalyst as shown in Fig. 9.It has been reported earlier also that selectivity can be increased via coordination activation.As seen in Ti 2p XPS spectrum, Ti 3 is present on TiO 2 surface and will act as an active site with presence of unpaired electrons.The CO 2 molecules get adsorbed onto photocatalyst via coordination to lewis base site i. e Ti 3 for instance (Sree et al., 2009).As seen in Fig. 9(a), The bridging TiCOO -Ti will be formed on TiO 2 sites located uniformly on thin BCN nanosheets.The adsorbed CO 2 molecules can interact with Ti 3 (as shown in Figure ) via an interfacial charge transfer mechanism thereby decreasing the required activation energy.On exposure to light, the 2 photo-generated electrons will transfer to the co-ordinated CO 2 molecules i. e TiC.Simultaneously, the H (protons) get connected into TiCOO -Ti via electrostatic forces of attraction to form TiHCOO -Ti intermediate as reported in a related previous work (Wang et al., 2021).This intermediate further gets converted into TiHCHO -Ti and TiCH 3 O -Ti which via further protonation and electron transfer (shown in Fig. 9(a)) leads to detachment of CH 4 molecule from catalyst surface.On the other hand, the holes (h ) would generate hydroxyl radicals.This explains the highly selective CH 4 formation.Fig. 9(b) shows the other way for CH 4 formation.The presence of FeTiO 2 facilitates two metal sites on to FT30/BCN heterojunction photcatalyst.Thus, Fe and Ti both can bond concurrently with C and O atoms (in CO 2 -as shown in figure)to form Fe-C-O-Ti i. e M 1 -C-O-M 2 reaction intermediate which favours only CH 4 formation.This is attributed to the fact that it is not easy to break both M 1 -C and M 2 -O bonds simultaneously.On the contrast, it's rather easy to dissociate C-H bonds via continuous protonation which weakens the M 1 -C and M 2 -O bonds simultaneously and produce CH 4 (Jiao et al., 2020). The in-situ XPS characterization, DFT analysis, scavenging experiments probe and band structure analysis predicts an exclusive S-scheme electron transfer mechanism for efficient electron separation and charge transfer capacity for efficient CO 2 reduction. The stability and reusability of the photocatalyst FT30/BCN was tested both for photocatalytic TC degradation and CO 2 reduction.Figure S6 shows that there is no abnormal loss in the activity of FT30/ BCN for TC degradation under visible light.A negligible fall in the TC removal rate was observed.The XRD pattern and SEM micrograph of FT30/BCN (Figure S7) obtained after reuse and recovery shows there is no change the structure and morphology.Thus catalyst is robust, highly stable and recyclable.Further, metal leaching tests were performed for Fe and Ti using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) (Agilent 8800 ICP-QQQ).Figure S8 shows that at pH 2 minor leaching rates were observed for Fe (0.03) and Ti (0.027).The leaching rates are negligible at pH 4.The ultra-low/negligible leaching shows the FT30/BCN photocatalyst is highly stable and does not promote secondary pollution.The catalytic stability of FT30/BCN was further investigated by carrying out the CO 2 reduction under visible light (Figure S9).It can be observed that the high rate of CH 4 evolution is maintained for three cycles i. e 15 h of experiment."}], "reaction medium": [{"llm generation": "CO2 water system", "source": "With CO 2 water system, under visible light as discussed earlier higher CH 4 production (123 mol g -1 ) was obtained.", "context": "3.1.Characterization Fig. 2 (a) shows the XRD patterns of synthesized photocatalysts.The XRD pattern for BCN shows a peak at 26.7 corresponding to graphitic structure of pristine boron carbon nitride which is well matched with ICDD PDF 53-0447.The peak at 43.1 corresponds to the (111) diffraction planes of BCN in sync with ICDD PDF 51-0768) (Chen et al., 2018).For Fe doped TiO 2 , the diffraction peaks corresponding to (110), ( 101), ( 200), ( 111), ( 210), ( 211), ( 220), ( 002), (311), and ( 112) are observed corresponding to tetragonal rutile TiO 2 which is in good agreement with (JCPDS No. 21-1276) (Wang et al., 2015).A slight shift is observed in 2 values as compared to pure rutile TiO 2 from literature because of doping as there is a difference in ionic radii of Fe and Ti.Fe doped TiO 2 is present in single phase without any trace of clusters of Fe as doping of Fe has been done on Ti sites in TiO 2 matrix.As doping content is less than 5 atomic there is no formation of any secondary phase related to Fe.The XRD patterns of binary junction series as FT/BCN show characteristic peaks of both FeTiO 2 and BCN with no extra phases.The peak intensities for BCN are highly reduced in the heterojunction.Change in intensities is observed which is due to variable content of BCN and FeTiO 2 and also due to the crystallinity differences between the two. The specific surface areas for FeTiO 2 and FT30/BCN were calculated as 32.1 m 2 /g and 74.4 m 2 /g, respectively.The adsorption isotherms (Figure S1) belong to typical type-IV isotherm with H3 type hysteresis loop.The mean pore volume and pore size for FeTiO 2 were 0.14 cm 3 /g, and 21.1 nm, respectively.The pore size and pore volume for FT30/BCN were 16.1 nm and 0.23 cm 3 /g, respectively.The surface area is increased on inclusion of BCN into FeTiO 2 which leads to increase in active sites, promoting the photocatalytic activity.The pore volume increased on inclusion of BCN because of improved dispersity of BCN and FeTiO 2 and the re-creation of pores.It is well known that a large surface area and porous structure favour the enhancement of the photocatalytic property via providing more active sites, accelerating the mass transfer or diffusion.The high surface area improves the photon utilization efficiency by providing more exposure and multiple reflections along the pores. The electronic environment, elemental composition and oxidation states of BCN and FT30/BCN were investigated by XPS analysis (Fig. 3).The survey scan (Figure S2) shows the presence of B, C, N in BCN and Fe, Ti, O, B, C, N in the FT30/BCN composite catalyst.In addition the XPS spectra were also obtained for FT30/BCN photocatalyst after visible light illumination to ascertain the binding energy shifts.Fig. 3(a) shows the B1s spectra for BCN and FT30/BCN.The spectra is deconvoluted into two peaks at 189.4 eV (B1) and 190.1 eV (B2) corresponding to B-C and B-N bonds respectively in BCN (Chang et al., 2013).For FT30/BCN heterojunction, in absence of light irradiation, slightly positive shift in B. E is exhibited compared to bare BCN.This signifies that electrons shift from BCN to FeTiO 2 .After light irradiation, a negative shift in B.E signifies, the electrons transfer from FeTiO 2 towards BCN (Kumar et al., 2020a).These findings are supported by C 1s, Ti 2p and O 1s spectra.(Zhou et al., 2018).The B.E exhibits positive shifts in FT30/BCN without light irradiation and negative shift upon illumination.This confirms the electrons shift from BCN towards FeTiO 2 towards on contact and FeTiO 2 to BCN upon illumination.These observations can be further verified from Ti 2p and O 1s spectra.Fig. 3(c) shows the deconvoluted Ti 2p spectra at 459.4 and 465.3 eV, assigned to Ti 2p 3/2 and Ti 2p 1/2 , respectively for Ti 4 oxidation state in TiO 2 (Li et al., 2020b).The peak at 459.9 eV corresponds to Ti 2p 1/2 for Ti 3 oxidation state.Thus both the oxidation states for Ti exist in the material.The Ti 2p spectra for the junction FT30/BCN shows negative shift in binding energies, confirming the electron shift from BCN to FeTiO 2 .Upon illumination B.E for Ti 2p shifts towards higher side, confirming the electron f low from FeTiO 2 towards BCN. The high-resolution O 1s XPS spectra for FT30/BCN (Fig. 3(d)) show three peaks at 528.5, 529.8 and 530.8 eV corresponding to lattice oxygen (metal-O bond), oxygen vacancies, loosely bound O/adsorbed OH groups respectively (Dhiman et al., 2017).The N 1s spectra (Fig. 3(e)) is deconvoluted into three peaks at 399.9, 401.2 and 402.8 eV which can be assigned to N-B, N-C and N-H bonds respectively (Zhou et al., 2020).The Fe 2p spectrum (Fig. 3(e)) shows two peaks at 715.6 and 729.4 eV corresponding 2p 3/2 and 2p 1/2 oxidation states for Fe 2 oxidation state.The peak positioned at 737.3 eV is assigned to 2p 1/2 for Fe 3 oxidation state.The satellite peak at 721.6 eV confirsm the presence of both Fe 2 and Fe 3 oxidation states.The Ti 3 oxidation state in the catalyst exists due to the generation of oxygen vacancies (OVs reduce the Ti 4 ) (Ye et al., 2021).Comparing the Ti 2p and O 1s spectra in FeTiO2 and FT30/BCN we can observe that there are changes in intensities of Ti as well as O 1s.There are changes in oxygen vacancies in the heterojunction as compared to FeTiO2 which will certainly change the intensity of Ti 3 . The B.E shifts confirm that after the contact between FeTiO 2 and BCN to form the FT/BCN heterojunction, there is electron transfer from BCN to FeTiO 2 .This migration is actually caused by difference in Fermi levels of two semiconductors.As BCN has a higher Fermi level than FeTiO 2 (see DFT calculations discussed later) the difference will drive the migration of electrons from BCN to FeTiO 2 until Fermi levels are aligned (Xia et al., 2020).Thus an internal electric field is created at the semiconductors interface.After illumination the band edge positioning and the internal electric field lead to migration of electrons from FeTiO 2 to BCN by an effective S-scheme transfer.The detailed analysis has been discussed in subsequent sections. The morphology and microstructure of BCN and FT30/BCN was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).Fig. 4(a) shows that exfoliated BCN exhibits lamellar sheets like morphology.The low resolution SEM image of FT30/BCN (Fig. 4 b) shows the spherical FeTiO 2 nanoparticles distributed uniformly over the irregular porous sheet of BCN.The high resolution image further shows that the spherical and uniform FeTiO 2 nanoparticles are in intimate contact with BCN sheets (Fig. 4(c)).Further microstructure was ascertained by TEM analysis.The lamellar nanosheets structure of exfoliated BCN can be observed in Fig. 4(d).The TEM image of FT30/BCN (Fig. 4(e)) confirms the uniform distribution of the spherical FeTiO 2 nanoparticles on to the BCN nanosheets.The high intimate contact between the two is surely beneficial for the electron flow and hence the photocatalytic activity.The HRTEM image (Fig. 4(f)) confirms the intimate contact and crystallinity.The lattice fringes of FeTiO 2 can be seen and the data matches with the XRD findings.However, due to poor crystallinity of BCN, it is difficult to observe the lattice fringes for the same.The presence of distributed Ti, O, Fe, B, C and N elements in FT30/BCN is shown in the SEM elemental mapping and corresponding elemental distribution (Fig. 4 g-m).This further demonstrates the close interfacial contact of two components and successful formation of the binary heterojunction. The light absorption properties of BCN, FeTiO 2 and FT30/BCN were characterized by the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-vis DRS) shown in Fig. 5(a).The BCN obviously absorbs in the visible range with absorption edge near 580 nm TiO 2 has a higher band gap with absorption in UV region.However, with 1.5 Fe doping, the absorption edge shows red shift with a better absorption in visible region.The heterojunction FT30/BCN shows a high absorption edge as compared to FeTiO 2 because oof inclusion of low band gap BCN.The increased optical harvesting improves quantum efficiency and photoredox catalysis.The band gap energy (E g ) was caluclated using Kubelka-Munk function (Kumar et al., 2020c).Therefore, the E g values for FeTiO 2 and BCN were estimated to be 2.70 and 2.45 eV, respectively (Fig. 5(b)). The band gap energy for FT30/BCN heterojunction (Figure S3) was found to be 2.57 eV.Further, Mott-Schottky function was utilized to estimate flat band potential (V FB ) as shown in Fig. 5(c-d).The V FB for BCN and FeTiO 2 are found to be 0.1 V and -1.0 V vs NHE respectively. The conduction band edge (E CB ) for an n-type semiconductor (as can be seen in M -S plots that both semiconductors are n-type) is generally 0.1-0.2eV (vs NHE) below the flat band energy (Kumar et al., 2020a). Considering the difference as 0.2 eV, the CB edges are calculated as -1.2 eV and -0.19 eV vs NHE for BCN and FeTiO 2 respectively.Finally, the VB edges (E VB ) were found to be 1.25 eV and 2.51 eV vs NHE for BCN and FeTiO 2 respectively.Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) derived Nyquist plots for BCN, FeTiO 2 and FT30/BCN are shown in Fig. 5(e).Evidently, FT30/BCN exhibits smallest arc radius as compared to bare semiconductors inferring that the heterojunction has lowest charge transfer resistance or highest transfer capacity.The photo-current density (Fig. 5 (f)) of FT30/BCN is significantly enhanced on the junction formation between FeTiO 2 and BCN which is consistent with EIS findings.The high photocurrent response (PCR) of the junction is attributed to higher visible absorption, high charge transfer capacity, reduced recombination and electron aggregation.This was further supported by photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy findings (Fig. 5(g)).The PL intensity falls dramatically in the heterojunction, suggesting that electron-hole recombination is highly diminished.Interestingly, the charge separation improves with increase in content of FeTiO 2 in BCN i. e from FT10/BCN to FT30/BCN.In addition, to elucidate the photo-induced electrons transfer direction and mechanism active at the FeTiO 2 and BCN interface, DFT calculations were employed.The DFT calculation was used to measure the electron density difference between the semiconductors.Fig. 5 (h) shows that FeTiO 2 is a typical oxidation photocatalyst (OP) with a large work function of 6.70 eV.On the other hand, BCN has a lower work function (3.51 eV) (Fig. 5(i)) and is a reduction photocatalyst (RP) quite similar to carbon nitride (Fu et al., 2019).Generally, the Fermi level position is inversely related to the work function.Fig. 9(a-c) shows the electron transfer mechanism in FT/BCN heterojunction.Thus, the Fermi level of BCN is higher than FeTiO 2 Before contact, the CB and VB positioning of FeTiO 2 and BCN shows that they form a staggered arrangement.After contact, the electrons spontaneously migrate from BCN towards FeTiO 2 across their interface until Fermi levels reach equilibrium.The electron output from BCN results in the bending of CB edge upwards.On the contrary, the band edge of FeTiO 2 gets bent downwards because of accumulation of electrons.Hence an internal electric field is set-up.The movement of electrons from BCN leads to formation of internal electric field which further prevents the further migration from BCN to FeTiO 2. On illumination, the electrons and holes get excited in both the semiconductors and the electrons from CB of FeTiO 2 gets migrated to VB of BCN and recombine with holes.This is facilitated by internal electric field and Coulomb interaction.These facts are supported by B.E shifts in XPS findings.The detailed mechanism is discussed in subsequent directions. Systematic tetracycline (TC) photocatalytic degradation experiments were conducted under visible light irradiation using 300 W Xe lamp (with visible light filter).Considering, the adsorption equilibrium, the stirring was performed under dark conditions for 30 min.Figure S4 shows that FT30/BCN shows 87.1 TC removal in 90 min with 31.2 adsorption in dark in 30 min.From 22.1 to 31.1 there is no substantial improvement in adsorption potential as we move from BCN to FT30/ BCN.However, FT30/BCN shows highest adsorption capacity because of high surface area and active sites as also supported by BET adsorption isotherms results.Secondly, under direct exposure, better performance was recorded as can be seen in Fig. 6(a).As shown, after 60 min visible light treatment, the TC removal rates of 45.1, 52.3, 70.1, 85.4, 93.1 and 96.2 were obtained in presence of BCN, FeTiO 2 , FT10/ BCN, FT20/BCN, FT40/BCN and FT30/BCN respectively.There is a substantial improvement in the TC removal rate for FT30/BCN as compared to bare BCN and FeTiO 2 which is due to higher visible capture capacity, reduced recombination and high charge transfer capacity on formation of heterojunction.With increase in content of FeTiO 2 in BCN, the TC degradation increases dramatically, but with very high content i. e 40FeTiO 2 the TC removal decreased.This is attributed to the fact that excess of FeTiO 2 not only hinders the interfacial contact, but also redundant material acts as recombination centres ().The high performance of FT30/BCN is supported by observations from UV-DRS, EIS, PCR and PL measurements.The pseudo-firstorder kinetic analysis for TC degradation is revealed in Fig. 6(b).The plots show that reaction rate for FT30/BCN (k app 0.7123 min -1 ) is nearly 7 times that of bare BCN (0.01246 min -1 ). During the photocatalytic process, pH, presence of electrolytes, water matrix and light source tend to affect the catalyst performance via controlling the surface charge distribution and production of active oxygen species.Fig. 6(c) shows that initial pH has a pronounced effect on the TC degradation by FT30/BCN under visible light.The highest TC removal was found to be 96.2 at pH 5.4 and this was chosen as optimized pH for all the experiments.TC possesses three different pKa values, i. e 3.30, 7.7 and 9.7 (Yi et al., 2020).The pH, pKa and pzc of the catalyst govern the interactions with the TC molecules and also control the strength of hydroxyl and superoxide radical anions in the system.The drug exists as (i) H 4 TC at pH 3.3, (ii) H 3 TC in the pH 3.3-7.7,(iii) H 2 TC -in the pH 7.7-9.7 and (iv) HTC 2-at pH 12.The higher degradation at pH 5.5 could be attributed to the attractive electrostatic force between H 3 TC and FT30/BCN (pzc 7.2).Highly acidic medium limits the adsorption due to repulsive forces and similar behaviour is expected at very high pH.Also, the alkaline medium leads to quenching of OH radicals (Kumar et al., 2020a). Further, effect of some common cations and anions onto TC removal with FT30/BCN catalyst was studied and results are shown in Fig. 6(d).Evidently it can be seen that Cl -and Na ions have no noticeable effect on the photocatalytic efficiency.It's worth mentioning that NO 3 -ions promote in the TC photodegradation (k app 0.07622 min -1 ).This is attributed to the fact that NO 3 -forms excited state on visible light irradiation to form NO 2 and OH which accelerates the TC degradation. On the other hand, HCO 3 -ions have an detrimental effect on TC removal (k app 0.06061 min -1 ) because they consume OH radicals to produce CO 3 -radicals.These radicals are less reactive than hydroxyl radicals and thus the degradation rate falls.The degree of inhibition is higher in case of SO 4 2-ions because they are effective radical scavengers (Tang et al., 2020b).However, Mg 2 showed little inhibitory effect, which may be attributed decrease of pH value and Ca 2 cause inhibition in TC removal because they tend to form co-ordination complexes with the drug molecule (Liu et al., 2020) and similar observations have been found in our previous works too (Kumar et al., 2020a).It is well known that Ca 2 ions form 1:2 ligand:metal complex with TC via chelation (Wessels et al., 1998).As it was observed that inorganic ions have a significant on the TC removal rate, we tested the degradation efficiency in real water system i. e river water, tap water and municipal water (Fig. 6(e)).The water quality parameters are listed in table S1.The TC removal efficiency of 96.2, 93.4, 92.3 and 94.1 in distilled water (DW), Municipal drinking water (MW), tap water (TW) and river water (RW) respectively.Definitely, presence of various ions, natural organic matter etc. leads to variation in the performance in various water matrices.However, it is clearly inferred that FT30/BCN heterojunction has a high potential in practical purification of waste water.Further, the TC degradation efficiency and total organic carbon (TOC) with FT30/BCN catalyst was tested under visible and solar light (Fig. 6(f)).Under natural solar light, 84.1 and 81.2 TC was removed in 60 min in DW and RW respectively.A high mineralization was also reported with 77.2 and 64.3 TOC removal in 2 h under visible and solar light in distilled water.A high TC degradation and TOC removal in river water both under visible light and solar light.This again establishes the findings that FT30/BCN heterojunction has a promising future in real waste water treatment. Radical scavenging experiments were performed to assess the role of reactive oxygen species involved in TC degradation under visible light.Fig. 6(g) shows the effect of 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1oxyl (TEMPOL), isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) as scavengers for et al., 2021).P7 with m/z 384 stemmed from the C-N bond cleavage from P6. P5 with m/z 396 was the by-product of TC methylation.P4 is decomposed into P6 (m/z 413) through the ring-opening process.P6 is continuously oxidized and decomposed to P8 (m/z 256) (ring break and removal of -COOH and -OH groups) and P9 (m/z 218).Further oxidations and decomposition via ring opening leads to formation of simpler moieties with m/Z 159 and 102 (Derikvandi et al., 2021).The intermediates are consistent with reported findings (Tang et al., 2020b).Further oxidation leads to formation of simpler aliphatic molecules and mineralized in longer run into inorganic compounds and gases as supported by high TOC removal findings. A suitable photocatalytic mechanism was predicted on basis of XPS, scavenging experiments, DFT calculations and ESR findings.The ESR DMPO- O 2 -spectrum (Fig. 6(h)) shows high intensity peaks (1:1:1:1) under visible light and no peaks in dark.This suggests that O 2 -radicals are major active species responsible for TC degradation and are present in higher concentration.Also, the DMPO- OH spectrum shows low intensity spectra (1:2:2:1) suggesting a little role of OH radicals in the degradation reaction.These results are supported by scavenging experiments.The thermodynamic feasibility of radical generation can be understood by analysing the band structure.As discussed earlier, from DFT calculations it was found that FeTiO 2 with a higher work function and low fermi level is a typical Oxidation type photocatalyst (OP).On the contrast, BCN has a lower work function with high Fermi level as for a typical reduction photocatalyst (RP).Thus, on contact (Fig. 7(b)) the electrons flow from BCN to FeTiO till Fermi levels align and the built-in electric field further restricts the movement of electrons.However, on exposure, as the electron-holes are produced in BCN and FeTiO 2 , the electrons move from CB of FeTiO towards VB of BCN benefitting from internal electric field, band bending (discussed earlier) and Coulomb interactions.The electrons from CB of FeTiO 2 (-0.19 eV) easily recombine with holes in VB of BCN (1.25 eV).However the recombination of electrons from BCN CB and holes from VB of FeTiO 2 is restrained by internal electric field.Thus a Step scheme (S-scheme) is operational here.The charge transfer in the Sscheme mechanism is shown in Fig. 7(c).Thus, the relatively useless photogenerated electrons in CB of FeTiO 2 (-0.19 eV) because they don't have enough energy for generation of The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O was tested under visible light without using any organic sacrificial reagent.Without use of Scheme 1. Possible degradation route of TC. any catalyst no gases were detected.The two major products detected were CH 4 and CO and traces of CH 3 OH.No or non-detectable hydrogen gas was evolved.Fig. 8 (a) and (b) shows the CO 2 conversion efficiency into CH 4 and CO with time respectively.The pristine BCN exhibits very low photocatalytic efficiency with 30.1 mol g -1 CH 4 evolution in 5 h of visible light irradiation.The sample FT30/BCN shows best photocatalytic performance with 123.2 mol g -1 and 10.3 mol g -1 CH 4 and CO evolution respectively.The cumulative CH 4 and CO evolution showing the selectivity of various samples is shown in Fig. 8(c).The CH 4 evolution follows the order: FT30/BCN (24.7 mol g -1 h -1 ) FT40/ BCN (20.4 mol g -1 h -1 ) FT20/BCN (18.4 mol g -1 h -1 ) FT10/BCN (14.2 mol g -1 h -1 ) FeTiO 2 (9.3 mol g -1 h -1 ) BCN (3.6 mol g -1 h -1 ).Comparing the gas evolution rates, it can be seen that FT30/BCN shows highest CH 4 evolution with 91.1 CH 4 selectivity (poor CO evolution 3.6 mol g -1 h -1 ).The average gas evolution, total electrons consumed in reduction and CH 4 selectivity of all samples is listed in Table 1.Comparing with the single catalyst BCN, it is observed that for BCN CO is evolved in higher amounts than CH 4 .However, CH 4 selectivity is higher in FeTiO 2 , though total efficiency is quite low.FT30/ BCN shows highest CH 4 selectivity.Owing to higher recombination rate and poor charge separation, the CO 2 conversion is poor in single semiconductors.However, on formation of heterojunction, dramatic conversion efficiency and CH 4 selectivity is observed.The performance is enhanced owing to following reasons: Firstly the improved quantum efficiency on junction formation, higher charge separation and effective S-scheme transfer mechanism as discussed in earlier sections.Secondly, the BCN nanosheets allow enough CO 2 adsorption and better binding of CO 2 molecules to the metal ions for higher reduction rate as more active sites ensure higher reduction (He et al., 2020).With the higher charge separation facilitated by built-in electric field in the heterojunction, more electrons are produced with time having high redox capability which brings about high CO 2 photoreduction.As seen in Scheme 2, the CH 4 evolution is an 8H /8e -reaction and CO formation is 2H /2e - reaction.Thus kinetically CO formation is favoured, however, CH 4 evolution is thermodynamically favourable.The thermodynamic and kinetic control thus plays important role in the selectivity (Li et al., 2020a). It has been well documented that hydrogen evolution (via water splitting) often competes with and CO 2 reduction (Li et al., 2012).However, non-detectable i. e extremely low yield, H 2 was evolved during the photocatalytic reaction. Firstly, the CO 2 photo-reduction performance was tested under alkali activation i. e using 0.2 M NaOH solution instead of distilled water.Fig. 8(d) shows the CH 4 evolution in 5 h time course under alkali activation.It can be observed that the CH 4 evolution increased to high extent for each catalyst i. e BCN, FeTiO 2 , FT10/BCN and FT30/BCN.For best performing FT30/BCN photocatalyst, under alkali activation, the CH 4 yield gets nearly doubled from 123.2 mol g -1 to 214.5 mol g -1 .The increase in CH 4 evolution is more prominent in heterojunction than in single semiconductors BCN and FeTiO 2 .The increase in the methane yield with alkali activation is attributed to following reasonsthe presence of alkalinity improves the CO 2 solubility and hydroxyl radical formation.The formation of hydroxyl radicals supports the electron-holes separation and favours CO 2 reduction. The photocatalytic performance of FT30/BCN heterojunction was further tested with variation of initial CO 2 /H 2 O feed ratio and keeping rest of parameters same.During the experiment, when CO 2 is passed through water saturator, the quantity of H 2 O vapors carried by CO 2 is dependent on the water vapour pressure.The high temperature favours more water vapors which makes CO 2 more saturated with H 2 O and thus the CO 2 /H 2 O feed ratio will be low.Conversely, low temperature leads to higher CO 2 /H 2 O feed ratio.The temperature of water saturator was maintained at 20, 30 and 40 C. Thus at 10 C, the feed contains highest CO 2 and at 40 C has lowest CO 2 content.Fig. 8(e) shows the effect of CO 2 /H 2 O feed ratio on photo-reduction of CO 2 under visible light with FT30/BCN.The performance order for CH 4 evolution in 5 h is as follows: 123.2 mol g -1 (30 C) 94.5 mol g -1 (40 C) and 70.2 mol g -1 (20 C).At 10 C (high CO 2 /H 2 O feed ratio) the CH 4 yield is lowest.The production rate increased at 30 C and then declined at 40 C further.At higher CO 2 /H 2 O feed ratio, more CO 2 gets attached to the photocatalyst surface and occupies to more active sites as compared to H 2 O molecules.The quantity of H 2 O molecules will thus not be enough to carry out the oxidation and produce lesser H and also lead to higher recombination.So when temperature is increased to higher temperature 40 C (lower CO 2 /H 2 O feed ratio), more of H 2 O molecules gets attached to catalytic sites and would lower the photocatalytic rate.The best performance is achieved at 30 C when appropriate number of H 2 O and CO 2 molecules gets attached to surface resulting in enough oxidation and reduction reactions with diminished recombination rate.In general higher H 2 O content would favour more CH 4 production, but very high content will hamper the photocatalytic reaction rate (Tahir and Tahir, 2020). Further, we investigated the performance of FT30/BCN composite photocatalyst using different reducing agents (H 2 O, methanol and H 2 ) Fig. 7.The S-scheme heterojunction of FeTiO 2 /BCN (a) before contact, (b) after contact, and (c) after contact upon irradiation and charge migration and separation.and light source (visible and solar light) (Fig. 8 f).Under all the experiments CH 4 and CO were the major products.With CO 2 water system, under visible light as discussed earlier higher CH 4 production (123 mol g -1 ) was obtained.With MeOH (methanol) as reducing agent, high yields of CH 4 (160.2mol g -1 ) and CO (18.6 mol g -1 ) were obtained.The CH 4 evolution under CO 2 MeOH was 1.3 times that of CO 2 H 2 O system.No hydrogen was detected.In CO 2 H 2 system also, appreciable quantity of CH 4 and CO were evolved.But the CO evolution was higher as compared to CH 4 with hydrogen as reducing agent which is consistent with earlier findings (Tahir et al., 2020).With methanol due to more protons (H ) production the CH 4 removal was significantly enhanced.Thus reducing agents have a pronounced effect on CO 2 conversion efficiency and CH 4 selectivity.Under solar light CO 2 H 2 O system a high CH 4 evolution 98.7 mol g -1 in 5 h is obtained with high selectivity.Thus, FT30/BCN photocatalyst is capable of efficient solar-to-fuel conversion with high selectivity and promising in real fuel production applications. As discussed earlier, the CH 4 evolution is an 8e -/8H reaction progressed by multiple steps and also via a multiple proton-coupled electron transfer route for high methane selectivity.With the progress of photocatalytic reaction, more photogenerated electrons are produced.Because of an effective S-scheme transfer between FeTiO 2 and BCN a high electron-holes separation is ensured.The FT30/BCN photocatalyst shows high charge transfer capacity, photocurrent response and highly diminished electron-hole recombination.Thus more electrons are available for high and selective CH 4 production.The pzc of the photocatalyst is 7.2 and thus slightly basic characteristics favour more CO 2 adsorption and hydrogenation too.Secondly it can be explained in The average gas evolution rates and CH 4 selectivity for various samples under visible light. Gas evolution (mol g another way that because of presence of RGO basic characteristics are induced on surface of ABR catalyst as pzc is 7.4, CO 2 adsorption and hydrogenation is favoured.The conversion of CO 2 into CO is a more favoured step involving 2H / 2e -mechanism.The S-scheme transfer mechanism which has already been discussed in previous sections saves the electrons and holes in high potential conduction band and valence band respectively.The redox potential for E o (CO/CO 2 ) -0.42eV and E o (CH 4 /CO 2 ) -0.24eV.The electrons accumulated in CB of BCN (-1.2 eV) are capable of for reducing CO 2 to CH 4 by route involving by single step multi electron transfer with proton coupling.The holes accumulated in VB of FeTiO 2 (2.51 eV) have high potential to produce protons from water.Thus the higher charge separation and availability of high potential electrons favour the high conversion efficiency and CH 4 selectivity.Also the short diffusion length of thin exfoliated BCN nanosheets generates more electrons on visible light exposure and favours CH 4 production.As seen in O 1s XPS spectrum in FT30/BCN, there are numerous O vacancies on the surface which trap electrons generated by BCN and FeTiO 2 and boost the photocatalytic activity.Furthermore, isotope experiment with 13 CO 2 and 12 CO 2 were performed for visible light CO 2 H 2 O FT30/BCN system (Figure S5).The existence of peaks at m/z 16 and m/z 17 for CH 4 shows that reduction products are reduced from the CO 2 and not by any other reaction or route. We have also predicted two more mechanisms for high CH 4 selectivity with FT30/BCN catalyst as shown in Fig. 9.It has been reported earlier also that selectivity can be increased via coordination activation.As seen in Ti 2p XPS spectrum, Ti 3 is present on TiO 2 surface and will act as an active site with presence of unpaired electrons.The CO 2 molecules get adsorbed onto photocatalyst via coordination to lewis base site i. e Ti 3 for instance (Sree et al., 2009).As seen in Fig. 9(a), The bridging TiCOO -Ti will be formed on TiO 2 sites located uniformly on thin BCN nanosheets.The adsorbed CO 2 molecules can interact with Ti 3 (as shown in Figure ) via an interfacial charge transfer mechanism thereby decreasing the required activation energy.On exposure to light, the 2 photo-generated electrons will transfer to the co-ordinated CO 2 molecules i. e TiC.Simultaneously, the H (protons) get connected into TiCOO -Ti via electrostatic forces of attraction to form TiHCOO -Ti intermediate as reported in a related previous work (Wang et al., 2021).This intermediate further gets converted into TiHCHO -Ti and TiCH 3 O -Ti which via further protonation and electron transfer (shown in Fig. 9(a)) leads to detachment of CH 4 molecule from catalyst surface.On the other hand, the holes (h ) would generate hydroxyl radicals.This explains the highly selective CH 4 formation.Fig. 9(b) shows the other way for CH 4 formation.The presence of FeTiO 2 facilitates two metal sites on to FT30/BCN heterojunction photcatalyst.Thus, Fe and Ti both can bond concurrently with C and O atoms (in CO 2 -as shown in figure)to form Fe-C-O-Ti i. e M 1 -C-O-M 2 reaction intermediate which favours only CH 4 formation.This is attributed to the fact that it is not easy to break both M 1 -C and M 2 -O bonds simultaneously.On the contrast, it's rather easy to dissociate C-H bonds via continuous protonation which weakens the M 1 -C and M 2 -O bonds simultaneously and produce CH 4 (Jiao et al., 2020). The in-situ XPS characterization, DFT analysis, scavenging experiments probe and band structure analysis predicts an exclusive S-scheme electron transfer mechanism for efficient electron separation and charge transfer capacity for efficient CO 2 reduction. The stability and reusability of the photocatalyst FT30/BCN was tested both for photocatalytic TC degradation and CO 2 reduction.Figure S6 shows that there is no abnormal loss in the activity of FT30/ BCN for TC degradation under visible light.A negligible fall in the TC removal rate was observed.The XRD pattern and SEM micrograph of FT30/BCN (Figure S7) obtained after reuse and recovery shows there is no change the structure and morphology.Thus catalyst is robust, highly stable and recyclable.Further, metal leaching tests were performed for Fe and Ti using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) (Agilent 8800 ICP-QQQ).Figure S8 shows that at pH 2 minor leaching rates were observed for Fe (0.03) and Ti (0.027).The leaching rates are negligible at pH 4.The ultra-low/negligible leaching shows the FT30/BCN photocatalyst is highly stable and does not promote secondary pollution.The catalytic stability of FT30/BCN was further investigated by carrying out the CO 2 reduction under visible light (Figure S9).It can be observed that the high rate of CH 4 evolution is maintained for three cycles i. e 15 h of experiment."}, {"llm generation": "CO2 H2O system", "source": "Furthermore, isotope experiment with 13 CO 2 and 12 CO 2 were performed for visible light CO 2 H 2 O FT30/BCN system (Figure S5).", "context": "3.1.Characterization Fig. 2 (a) shows the XRD patterns of synthesized photocatalysts.The XRD pattern for BCN shows a peak at 26.7 corresponding to graphitic structure of pristine boron carbon nitride which is well matched with ICDD PDF 53-0447.The peak at 43.1 corresponds to the (111) diffraction planes of BCN in sync with ICDD PDF 51-0768) (Chen et al., 2018).For Fe doped TiO 2 , the diffraction peaks corresponding to (110), ( 101), ( 200), ( 111), ( 210), ( 211), ( 220), ( 002), (311), and ( 112) are observed corresponding to tetragonal rutile TiO 2 which is in good agreement with (JCPDS No. 21-1276) (Wang et al., 2015).A slight shift is observed in 2 values as compared to pure rutile TiO 2 from literature because of doping as there is a difference in ionic radii of Fe and Ti.Fe doped TiO 2 is present in single phase without any trace of clusters of Fe as doping of Fe has been done on Ti sites in TiO 2 matrix.As doping content is less than 5 atomic there is no formation of any secondary phase related to Fe.The XRD patterns of binary junction series as FT/BCN show characteristic peaks of both FeTiO 2 and BCN with no extra phases.The peak intensities for BCN are highly reduced in the heterojunction.Change in intensities is observed which is due to variable content of BCN and FeTiO 2 and also due to the crystallinity differences between the two. The specific surface areas for FeTiO 2 and FT30/BCN were calculated as 32.1 m 2 /g and 74.4 m 2 /g, respectively.The adsorption isotherms (Figure S1) belong to typical type-IV isotherm with H3 type hysteresis loop.The mean pore volume and pore size for FeTiO 2 were 0.14 cm 3 /g, and 21.1 nm, respectively.The pore size and pore volume for FT30/BCN were 16.1 nm and 0.23 cm 3 /g, respectively.The surface area is increased on inclusion of BCN into FeTiO 2 which leads to increase in active sites, promoting the photocatalytic activity.The pore volume increased on inclusion of BCN because of improved dispersity of BCN and FeTiO 2 and the re-creation of pores.It is well known that a large surface area and porous structure favour the enhancement of the photocatalytic property via providing more active sites, accelerating the mass transfer or diffusion.The high surface area improves the photon utilization efficiency by providing more exposure and multiple reflections along the pores. The electronic environment, elemental composition and oxidation states of BCN and FT30/BCN were investigated by XPS analysis (Fig. 3).The survey scan (Figure S2) shows the presence of B, C, N in BCN and Fe, Ti, O, B, C, N in the FT30/BCN composite catalyst.In addition the XPS spectra were also obtained for FT30/BCN photocatalyst after visible light illumination to ascertain the binding energy shifts.Fig. 3(a) shows the B1s spectra for BCN and FT30/BCN.The spectra is deconvoluted into two peaks at 189.4 eV (B1) and 190.1 eV (B2) corresponding to B-C and B-N bonds respectively in BCN (Chang et al., 2013).For FT30/BCN heterojunction, in absence of light irradiation, slightly positive shift in B. E is exhibited compared to bare BCN.This signifies that electrons shift from BCN to FeTiO 2 .After light irradiation, a negative shift in B.E signifies, the electrons transfer from FeTiO 2 towards BCN (Kumar et al., 2020a).These findings are supported by C 1s, Ti 2p and O 1s spectra.(Zhou et al., 2018).The B.E exhibits positive shifts in FT30/BCN without light irradiation and negative shift upon illumination.This confirms the electrons shift from BCN towards FeTiO 2 towards on contact and FeTiO 2 to BCN upon illumination.These observations can be further verified from Ti 2p and O 1s spectra.Fig. 3(c) shows the deconvoluted Ti 2p spectra at 459.4 and 465.3 eV, assigned to Ti 2p 3/2 and Ti 2p 1/2 , respectively for Ti 4 oxidation state in TiO 2 (Li et al., 2020b).The peak at 459.9 eV corresponds to Ti 2p 1/2 for Ti 3 oxidation state.Thus both the oxidation states for Ti exist in the material.The Ti 2p spectra for the junction FT30/BCN shows negative shift in binding energies, confirming the electron shift from BCN to FeTiO 2 .Upon illumination B.E for Ti 2p shifts towards higher side, confirming the electron f low from FeTiO 2 towards BCN. The high-resolution O 1s XPS spectra for FT30/BCN (Fig. 3(d)) show three peaks at 528.5, 529.8 and 530.8 eV corresponding to lattice oxygen (metal-O bond), oxygen vacancies, loosely bound O/adsorbed OH groups respectively (Dhiman et al., 2017).The N 1s spectra (Fig. 3(e)) is deconvoluted into three peaks at 399.9, 401.2 and 402.8 eV which can be assigned to N-B, N-C and N-H bonds respectively (Zhou et al., 2020).The Fe 2p spectrum (Fig. 3(e)) shows two peaks at 715.6 and 729.4 eV corresponding 2p 3/2 and 2p 1/2 oxidation states for Fe 2 oxidation state.The peak positioned at 737.3 eV is assigned to 2p 1/2 for Fe 3 oxidation state.The satellite peak at 721.6 eV confirsm the presence of both Fe 2 and Fe 3 oxidation states.The Ti 3 oxidation state in the catalyst exists due to the generation of oxygen vacancies (OVs reduce the Ti 4 ) (Ye et al., 2021).Comparing the Ti 2p and O 1s spectra in FeTiO2 and FT30/BCN we can observe that there are changes in intensities of Ti as well as O 1s.There are changes in oxygen vacancies in the heterojunction as compared to FeTiO2 which will certainly change the intensity of Ti 3 . The B.E shifts confirm that after the contact between FeTiO 2 and BCN to form the FT/BCN heterojunction, there is electron transfer from BCN to FeTiO 2 .This migration is actually caused by difference in Fermi levels of two semiconductors.As BCN has a higher Fermi level than FeTiO 2 (see DFT calculations discussed later) the difference will drive the migration of electrons from BCN to FeTiO 2 until Fermi levels are aligned (Xia et al., 2020).Thus an internal electric field is created at the semiconductors interface.After illumination the band edge positioning and the internal electric field lead to migration of electrons from FeTiO 2 to BCN by an effective S-scheme transfer.The detailed analysis has been discussed in subsequent sections. The morphology and microstructure of BCN and FT30/BCN was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).Fig. 4(a) shows that exfoliated BCN exhibits lamellar sheets like morphology.The low resolution SEM image of FT30/BCN (Fig. 4 b) shows the spherical FeTiO 2 nanoparticles distributed uniformly over the irregular porous sheet of BCN.The high resolution image further shows that the spherical and uniform FeTiO 2 nanoparticles are in intimate contact with BCN sheets (Fig. 4(c)).Further microstructure was ascertained by TEM analysis.The lamellar nanosheets structure of exfoliated BCN can be observed in Fig. 4(d).The TEM image of FT30/BCN (Fig. 4(e)) confirms the uniform distribution of the spherical FeTiO 2 nanoparticles on to the BCN nanosheets.The high intimate contact between the two is surely beneficial for the electron flow and hence the photocatalytic activity.The HRTEM image (Fig. 4(f)) confirms the intimate contact and crystallinity.The lattice fringes of FeTiO 2 can be seen and the data matches with the XRD findings.However, due to poor crystallinity of BCN, it is difficult to observe the lattice fringes for the same.The presence of distributed Ti, O, Fe, B, C and N elements in FT30/BCN is shown in the SEM elemental mapping and corresponding elemental distribution (Fig. 4 g-m).This further demonstrates the close interfacial contact of two components and successful formation of the binary heterojunction. The light absorption properties of BCN, FeTiO 2 and FT30/BCN were characterized by the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-vis DRS) shown in Fig. 5(a).The BCN obviously absorbs in the visible range with absorption edge near 580 nm TiO 2 has a higher band gap with absorption in UV region.However, with 1.5 Fe doping, the absorption edge shows red shift with a better absorption in visible region.The heterojunction FT30/BCN shows a high absorption edge as compared to FeTiO 2 because oof inclusion of low band gap BCN.The increased optical harvesting improves quantum efficiency and photoredox catalysis.The band gap energy (E g ) was caluclated using Kubelka-Munk function (Kumar et al., 2020c).Therefore, the E g values for FeTiO 2 and BCN were estimated to be 2.70 and 2.45 eV, respectively (Fig. 5(b)). The band gap energy for FT30/BCN heterojunction (Figure S3) was found to be 2.57 eV.Further, Mott-Schottky function was utilized to estimate flat band potential (V FB ) as shown in Fig. 5(c-d).The V FB for BCN and FeTiO 2 are found to be 0.1 V and -1.0 V vs NHE respectively. The conduction band edge (E CB ) for an n-type semiconductor (as can be seen in M -S plots that both semiconductors are n-type) is generally 0.1-0.2eV (vs NHE) below the flat band energy (Kumar et al., 2020a). Considering the difference as 0.2 eV, the CB edges are calculated as -1.2 eV and -0.19 eV vs NHE for BCN and FeTiO 2 respectively.Finally, the VB edges (E VB ) were found to be 1.25 eV and 2.51 eV vs NHE for BCN and FeTiO 2 respectively.Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) derived Nyquist plots for BCN, FeTiO 2 and FT30/BCN are shown in Fig. 5(e).Evidently, FT30/BCN exhibits smallest arc radius as compared to bare semiconductors inferring that the heterojunction has lowest charge transfer resistance or highest transfer capacity.The photo-current density (Fig. 5 (f)) of FT30/BCN is significantly enhanced on the junction formation between FeTiO 2 and BCN which is consistent with EIS findings.The high photocurrent response (PCR) of the junction is attributed to higher visible absorption, high charge transfer capacity, reduced recombination and electron aggregation.This was further supported by photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy findings (Fig. 5(g)).The PL intensity falls dramatically in the heterojunction, suggesting that electron-hole recombination is highly diminished.Interestingly, the charge separation improves with increase in content of FeTiO 2 in BCN i. e from FT10/BCN to FT30/BCN.In addition, to elucidate the photo-induced electrons transfer direction and mechanism active at the FeTiO 2 and BCN interface, DFT calculations were employed.The DFT calculation was used to measure the electron density difference between the semiconductors.Fig. 5 (h) shows that FeTiO 2 is a typical oxidation photocatalyst (OP) with a large work function of 6.70 eV.On the other hand, BCN has a lower work function (3.51 eV) (Fig. 5(i)) and is a reduction photocatalyst (RP) quite similar to carbon nitride (Fu et al., 2019).Generally, the Fermi level position is inversely related to the work function.Fig. 9(a-c) shows the electron transfer mechanism in FT/BCN heterojunction.Thus, the Fermi level of BCN is higher than FeTiO 2 Before contact, the CB and VB positioning of FeTiO 2 and BCN shows that they form a staggered arrangement.After contact, the electrons spontaneously migrate from BCN towards FeTiO 2 across their interface until Fermi levels reach equilibrium.The electron output from BCN results in the bending of CB edge upwards.On the contrary, the band edge of FeTiO 2 gets bent downwards because of accumulation of electrons.Hence an internal electric field is set-up.The movement of electrons from BCN leads to formation of internal electric field which further prevents the further migration from BCN to FeTiO 2. On illumination, the electrons and holes get excited in both the semiconductors and the electrons from CB of FeTiO 2 gets migrated to VB of BCN and recombine with holes.This is facilitated by internal electric field and Coulomb interaction.These facts are supported by B.E shifts in XPS findings.The detailed mechanism is discussed in subsequent directions. Systematic tetracycline (TC) photocatalytic degradation experiments were conducted under visible light irradiation using 300 W Xe lamp (with visible light filter).Considering, the adsorption equilibrium, the stirring was performed under dark conditions for 30 min.Figure S4 shows that FT30/BCN shows 87.1 TC removal in 90 min with 31.2 adsorption in dark in 30 min.From 22.1 to 31.1 there is no substantial improvement in adsorption potential as we move from BCN to FT30/ BCN.However, FT30/BCN shows highest adsorption capacity because of high surface area and active sites as also supported by BET adsorption isotherms results.Secondly, under direct exposure, better performance was recorded as can be seen in Fig. 6(a).As shown, after 60 min visible light treatment, the TC removal rates of 45.1, 52.3, 70.1, 85.4, 93.1 and 96.2 were obtained in presence of BCN, FeTiO 2 , FT10/ BCN, FT20/BCN, FT40/BCN and FT30/BCN respectively.There is a substantial improvement in the TC removal rate for FT30/BCN as compared to bare BCN and FeTiO 2 which is due to higher visible capture capacity, reduced recombination and high charge transfer capacity on formation of heterojunction.With increase in content of FeTiO 2 in BCN, the TC degradation increases dramatically, but with very high content i. e 40FeTiO 2 the TC removal decreased.This is attributed to the fact that excess of FeTiO 2 not only hinders the interfacial contact, but also redundant material acts as recombination centres ().The high performance of FT30/BCN is supported by observations from UV-DRS, EIS, PCR and PL measurements.The pseudo-firstorder kinetic analysis for TC degradation is revealed in Fig. 6(b).The plots show that reaction rate for FT30/BCN (k app 0.7123 min -1 ) is nearly 7 times that of bare BCN (0.01246 min -1 ). During the photocatalytic process, pH, presence of electrolytes, water matrix and light source tend to affect the catalyst performance via controlling the surface charge distribution and production of active oxygen species.Fig. 6(c) shows that initial pH has a pronounced effect on the TC degradation by FT30/BCN under visible light.The highest TC removal was found to be 96.2 at pH 5.4 and this was chosen as optimized pH for all the experiments.TC possesses three different pKa values, i. e 3.30, 7.7 and 9.7 (Yi et al., 2020).The pH, pKa and pzc of the catalyst govern the interactions with the TC molecules and also control the strength of hydroxyl and superoxide radical anions in the system.The drug exists as (i) H 4 TC at pH 3.3, (ii) H 3 TC in the pH 3.3-7.7,(iii) H 2 TC -in the pH 7.7-9.7 and (iv) HTC 2-at pH 12.The higher degradation at pH 5.5 could be attributed to the attractive electrostatic force between H 3 TC and FT30/BCN (pzc 7.2).Highly acidic medium limits the adsorption due to repulsive forces and similar behaviour is expected at very high pH.Also, the alkaline medium leads to quenching of OH radicals (Kumar et al., 2020a). Further, effect of some common cations and anions onto TC removal with FT30/BCN catalyst was studied and results are shown in Fig. 6(d).Evidently it can be seen that Cl -and Na ions have no noticeable effect on the photocatalytic efficiency.It's worth mentioning that NO 3 -ions promote in the TC photodegradation (k app 0.07622 min -1 ).This is attributed to the fact that NO 3 -forms excited state on visible light irradiation to form NO 2 and OH which accelerates the TC degradation. On the other hand, HCO 3 -ions have an detrimental effect on TC removal (k app 0.06061 min -1 ) because they consume OH radicals to produce CO 3 -radicals.These radicals are less reactive than hydroxyl radicals and thus the degradation rate falls.The degree of inhibition is higher in case of SO 4 2-ions because they are effective radical scavengers (Tang et al., 2020b).However, Mg 2 showed little inhibitory effect, which may be attributed decrease of pH value and Ca 2 cause inhibition in TC removal because they tend to form co-ordination complexes with the drug molecule (Liu et al., 2020) and similar observations have been found in our previous works too (Kumar et al., 2020a).It is well known that Ca 2 ions form 1:2 ligand:metal complex with TC via chelation (Wessels et al., 1998).As it was observed that inorganic ions have a significant on the TC removal rate, we tested the degradation efficiency in real water system i. e river water, tap water and municipal water (Fig. 6(e)).The water quality parameters are listed in table S1.The TC removal efficiency of 96.2, 93.4, 92.3 and 94.1 in distilled water (DW), Municipal drinking water (MW), tap water (TW) and river water (RW) respectively.Definitely, presence of various ions, natural organic matter etc. leads to variation in the performance in various water matrices.However, it is clearly inferred that FT30/BCN heterojunction has a high potential in practical purification of waste water.Further, the TC degradation efficiency and total organic carbon (TOC) with FT30/BCN catalyst was tested under visible and solar light (Fig. 6(f)).Under natural solar light, 84.1 and 81.2 TC was removed in 60 min in DW and RW respectively.A high mineralization was also reported with 77.2 and 64.3 TOC removal in 2 h under visible and solar light in distilled water.A high TC degradation and TOC removal in river water both under visible light and solar light.This again establishes the findings that FT30/BCN heterojunction has a promising future in real waste water treatment. Radical scavenging experiments were performed to assess the role of reactive oxygen species involved in TC degradation under visible light.Fig. 6(g) shows the effect of 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1oxyl (TEMPOL), isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) as scavengers for et al., 2021).P7 with m/z 384 stemmed from the C-N bond cleavage from P6. P5 with m/z 396 was the by-product of TC methylation.P4 is decomposed into P6 (m/z 413) through the ring-opening process.P6 is continuously oxidized and decomposed to P8 (m/z 256) (ring break and removal of -COOH and -OH groups) and P9 (m/z 218).Further oxidations and decomposition via ring opening leads to formation of simpler moieties with m/Z 159 and 102 (Derikvandi et al., 2021).The intermediates are consistent with reported findings (Tang et al., 2020b).Further oxidation leads to formation of simpler aliphatic molecules and mineralized in longer run into inorganic compounds and gases as supported by high TOC removal findings. A suitable photocatalytic mechanism was predicted on basis of XPS, scavenging experiments, DFT calculations and ESR findings.The ESR DMPO- O 2 -spectrum (Fig. 6(h)) shows high intensity peaks (1:1:1:1) under visible light and no peaks in dark.This suggests that O 2 -radicals are major active species responsible for TC degradation and are present in higher concentration.Also, the DMPO- OH spectrum shows low intensity spectra (1:2:2:1) suggesting a little role of OH radicals in the degradation reaction.These results are supported by scavenging experiments.The thermodynamic feasibility of radical generation can be understood by analysing the band structure.As discussed earlier, from DFT calculations it was found that FeTiO 2 with a higher work function and low fermi level is a typical Oxidation type photocatalyst (OP).On the contrast, BCN has a lower work function with high Fermi level as for a typical reduction photocatalyst (RP).Thus, on contact (Fig. 7(b)) the electrons flow from BCN to FeTiO till Fermi levels align and the built-in electric field further restricts the movement of electrons.However, on exposure, as the electron-holes are produced in BCN and FeTiO 2 , the electrons move from CB of FeTiO towards VB of BCN benefitting from internal electric field, band bending (discussed earlier) and Coulomb interactions.The electrons from CB of FeTiO 2 (-0.19 eV) easily recombine with holes in VB of BCN (1.25 eV).However the recombination of electrons from BCN CB and holes from VB of FeTiO 2 is restrained by internal electric field.Thus a Step scheme (S-scheme) is operational here.The charge transfer in the Sscheme mechanism is shown in Fig. 7(c).Thus, the relatively useless photogenerated electrons in CB of FeTiO 2 (-0.19 eV) because they don't have enough energy for generation of The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O was tested under visible light without using any organic sacrificial reagent.Without use of Scheme 1. Possible degradation route of TC. any catalyst no gases were detected.The two major products detected were CH 4 and CO and traces of CH 3 OH.No or non-detectable hydrogen gas was evolved.Fig. 8 (a) and (b) shows the CO 2 conversion efficiency into CH 4 and CO with time respectively.The pristine BCN exhibits very low photocatalytic efficiency with 30.1 mol g -1 CH 4 evolution in 5 h of visible light irradiation.The sample FT30/BCN shows best photocatalytic performance with 123.2 mol g -1 and 10.3 mol g -1 CH 4 and CO evolution respectively.The cumulative CH 4 and CO evolution showing the selectivity of various samples is shown in Fig. 8(c).The CH 4 evolution follows the order: FT30/BCN (24.7 mol g -1 h -1 ) FT40/ BCN (20.4 mol g -1 h -1 ) FT20/BCN (18.4 mol g -1 h -1 ) FT10/BCN (14.2 mol g -1 h -1 ) FeTiO 2 (9.3 mol g -1 h -1 ) BCN (3.6 mol g -1 h -1 ).Comparing the gas evolution rates, it can be seen that FT30/BCN shows highest CH 4 evolution with 91.1 CH 4 selectivity (poor CO evolution 3.6 mol g -1 h -1 ).The average gas evolution, total electrons consumed in reduction and CH 4 selectivity of all samples is listed in Table 1.Comparing with the single catalyst BCN, it is observed that for BCN CO is evolved in higher amounts than CH 4 .However, CH 4 selectivity is higher in FeTiO 2 , though total efficiency is quite low.FT30/ BCN shows highest CH 4 selectivity.Owing to higher recombination rate and poor charge separation, the CO 2 conversion is poor in single semiconductors.However, on formation of heterojunction, dramatic conversion efficiency and CH 4 selectivity is observed.The performance is enhanced owing to following reasons: Firstly the improved quantum efficiency on junction formation, higher charge separation and effective S-scheme transfer mechanism as discussed in earlier sections.Secondly, the BCN nanosheets allow enough CO 2 adsorption and better binding of CO 2 molecules to the metal ions for higher reduction rate as more active sites ensure higher reduction (He et al., 2020).With the higher charge separation facilitated by built-in electric field in the heterojunction, more electrons are produced with time having high redox capability which brings about high CO 2 photoreduction.As seen in Scheme 2, the CH 4 evolution is an 8H /8e -reaction and CO formation is 2H /2e - reaction.Thus kinetically CO formation is favoured, however, CH 4 evolution is thermodynamically favourable.The thermodynamic and kinetic control thus plays important role in the selectivity (Li et al., 2020a). It has been well documented that hydrogen evolution (via water splitting) often competes with and CO 2 reduction (Li et al., 2012).However, non-detectable i. e extremely low yield, H 2 was evolved during the photocatalytic reaction. Firstly, the CO 2 photo-reduction performance was tested under alkali activation i. e using 0.2 M NaOH solution instead of distilled water.Fig. 8(d) shows the CH 4 evolution in 5 h time course under alkali activation.It can be observed that the CH 4 evolution increased to high extent for each catalyst i. e BCN, FeTiO 2 , FT10/BCN and FT30/BCN.For best performing FT30/BCN photocatalyst, under alkali activation, the CH 4 yield gets nearly doubled from 123.2 mol g -1 to 214.5 mol g -1 .The increase in CH 4 evolution is more prominent in heterojunction than in single semiconductors BCN and FeTiO 2 .The increase in the methane yield with alkali activation is attributed to following reasonsthe presence of alkalinity improves the CO 2 solubility and hydroxyl radical formation.The formation of hydroxyl radicals supports the electron-holes separation and favours CO 2 reduction. The photocatalytic performance of FT30/BCN heterojunction was further tested with variation of initial CO 2 /H 2 O feed ratio and keeping rest of parameters same.During the experiment, when CO 2 is passed through water saturator, the quantity of H 2 O vapors carried by CO 2 is dependent on the water vapour pressure.The high temperature favours more water vapors which makes CO 2 more saturated with H 2 O and thus the CO 2 /H 2 O feed ratio will be low.Conversely, low temperature leads to higher CO 2 /H 2 O feed ratio.The temperature of water saturator was maintained at 20, 30 and 40 C. Thus at 10 C, the feed contains highest CO 2 and at 40 C has lowest CO 2 content.Fig. 8(e) shows the effect of CO 2 /H 2 O feed ratio on photo-reduction of CO 2 under visible light with FT30/BCN.The performance order for CH 4 evolution in 5 h is as follows: 123.2 mol g -1 (30 C) 94.5 mol g -1 (40 C) and 70.2 mol g -1 (20 C).At 10 C (high CO 2 /H 2 O feed ratio) the CH 4 yield is lowest.The production rate increased at 30 C and then declined at 40 C further.At higher CO 2 /H 2 O feed ratio, more CO 2 gets attached to the photocatalyst surface and occupies to more active sites as compared to H 2 O molecules.The quantity of H 2 O molecules will thus not be enough to carry out the oxidation and produce lesser H and also lead to higher recombination.So when temperature is increased to higher temperature 40 C (lower CO 2 /H 2 O feed ratio), more of H 2 O molecules gets attached to catalytic sites and would lower the photocatalytic rate.The best performance is achieved at 30 C when appropriate number of H 2 O and CO 2 molecules gets attached to surface resulting in enough oxidation and reduction reactions with diminished recombination rate.In general higher H 2 O content would favour more CH 4 production, but very high content will hamper the photocatalytic reaction rate (Tahir and Tahir, 2020). Further, we investigated the performance of FT30/BCN composite photocatalyst using different reducing agents (H 2 O, methanol and H 2 ) Fig. 7.The S-scheme heterojunction of FeTiO 2 /BCN (a) before contact, (b) after contact, and (c) after contact upon irradiation and charge migration and separation.and light source (visible and solar light) (Fig. 8 f).Under all the experiments CH 4 and CO were the major products.With CO 2 water system, under visible light as discussed earlier higher CH 4 production (123 mol g -1 ) was obtained.With MeOH (methanol) as reducing agent, high yields of CH 4 (160.2mol g -1 ) and CO (18.6 mol g -1 ) were obtained.The CH 4 evolution under CO 2 MeOH was 1.3 times that of CO 2 H 2 O system.No hydrogen was detected.In CO 2 H 2 system also, appreciable quantity of CH 4 and CO were evolved.But the CO evolution was higher as compared to CH 4 with hydrogen as reducing agent which is consistent with earlier findings (Tahir et al., 2020).With methanol due to more protons (H ) production the CH 4 removal was significantly enhanced.Thus reducing agents have a pronounced effect on CO 2 conversion efficiency and CH 4 selectivity.Under solar light CO 2 H 2 O system a high CH 4 evolution 98.7 mol g -1 in 5 h is obtained with high selectivity.Thus, FT30/BCN photocatalyst is capable of efficient solar-to-fuel conversion with high selectivity and promising in real fuel production applications. As discussed earlier, the CH 4 evolution is an 8e -/8H reaction progressed by multiple steps and also via a multiple proton-coupled electron transfer route for high methane selectivity.With the progress of photocatalytic reaction, more photogenerated electrons are produced.Because of an effective S-scheme transfer between FeTiO 2 and BCN a high electron-holes separation is ensured.The FT30/BCN photocatalyst shows high charge transfer capacity, photocurrent response and highly diminished electron-hole recombination.Thus more electrons are available for high and selective CH 4 production.The pzc of the photocatalyst is 7.2 and thus slightly basic characteristics favour more CO 2 adsorption and hydrogenation too.Secondly it can be explained in The average gas evolution rates and CH 4 selectivity for various samples under visible light. Gas evolution (mol g another way that because of presence of RGO basic characteristics are induced on surface of ABR catalyst as pzc is 7.4, CO 2 adsorption and hydrogenation is favoured.The conversion of CO 2 into CO is a more favoured step involving 2H / 2e -mechanism.The S-scheme transfer mechanism which has already been discussed in previous sections saves the electrons and holes in high potential conduction band and valence band respectively.The redox potential for E o (CO/CO 2 ) -0.42eV and E o (CH 4 /CO 2 ) -0.24eV.The electrons accumulated in CB of BCN (-1.2 eV) are capable of for reducing CO 2 to CH 4 by route involving by single step multi electron transfer with proton coupling.The holes accumulated in VB of FeTiO 2 (2.51 eV) have high potential to produce protons from water.Thus the higher charge separation and availability of high potential electrons favour the high conversion efficiency and CH 4 selectivity.Also the short diffusion length of thin exfoliated BCN nanosheets generates more electrons on visible light exposure and favours CH 4 production.As seen in O 1s XPS spectrum in FT30/BCN, there are numerous O vacancies on the surface which trap electrons generated by BCN and FeTiO 2 and boost the photocatalytic activity.Furthermore, isotope experiment with 13 CO 2 and 12 CO 2 were performed for visible light CO 2 H 2 O FT30/BCN system (Figure S5).The existence of peaks at m/z 16 and m/z 17 for CH 4 shows that reduction products are reduced from the CO 2 and not by any other reaction or route. We have also predicted two more mechanisms for high CH 4 selectivity with FT30/BCN catalyst as shown in Fig. 9.It has been reported earlier also that selectivity can be increased via coordination activation.As seen in Ti 2p XPS spectrum, Ti 3 is present on TiO 2 surface and will act as an active site with presence of unpaired electrons.The CO 2 molecules get adsorbed onto photocatalyst via coordination to lewis base site i. e Ti 3 for instance (Sree et al., 2009).As seen in Fig. 9(a), The bridging TiCOO -Ti will be formed on TiO 2 sites located uniformly on thin BCN nanosheets.The adsorbed CO 2 molecules can interact with Ti 3 (as shown in Figure ) via an interfacial charge transfer mechanism thereby decreasing the required activation energy.On exposure to light, the 2 photo-generated electrons will transfer to the co-ordinated CO 2 molecules i. e TiC.Simultaneously, the H (protons) get connected into TiCOO -Ti via electrostatic forces of attraction to form TiHCOO -Ti intermediate as reported in a related previous work (Wang et al., 2021).This intermediate further gets converted into TiHCHO -Ti and TiCH 3 O -Ti which via further protonation and electron transfer (shown in Fig. 9(a)) leads to detachment of CH 4 molecule from catalyst surface.On the other hand, the holes (h ) would generate hydroxyl radicals.This explains the highly selective CH 4 formation.Fig. 9(b) shows the other way for CH 4 formation.The presence of FeTiO 2 facilitates two metal sites on to FT30/BCN heterojunction photcatalyst.Thus, Fe and Ti both can bond concurrently with C and O atoms (in CO 2 -as shown in figure)to form Fe-C-O-Ti i. e M 1 -C-O-M 2 reaction intermediate which favours only CH 4 formation.This is attributed to the fact that it is not easy to break both M 1 -C and M 2 -O bonds simultaneously.On the contrast, it's rather easy to dissociate C-H bonds via continuous protonation which weakens the M 1 -C and M 2 -O bonds simultaneously and produce CH 4 (Jiao et al., 2020). The in-situ XPS characterization, DFT analysis, scavenging experiments probe and band structure analysis predicts an exclusive S-scheme electron transfer mechanism for efficient electron separation and charge transfer capacity for efficient CO 2 reduction. The stability and reusability of the photocatalyst FT30/BCN was tested both for photocatalytic TC degradation and CO 2 reduction.Figure S6 shows that there is no abnormal loss in the activity of FT30/ BCN for TC degradation under visible light.A negligible fall in the TC removal rate was observed.The XRD pattern and SEM micrograph of FT30/BCN (Figure S7) obtained after reuse and recovery shows there is no change the structure and morphology.Thus catalyst is robust, highly stable and recyclable.Further, metal leaching tests were performed for Fe and Ti using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) (Agilent 8800 ICP-QQQ).Figure S8 shows that at pH 2 minor leaching rates were observed for Fe (0.03) and Ti (0.027).The leaching rates are negligible at pH 4.The ultra-low/negligible leaching shows the FT30/BCN photocatalyst is highly stable and does not promote secondary pollution.The catalytic stability of FT30/BCN was further investigated by carrying out the CO 2 reduction under visible light (Figure S9).It can be observed that the high rate of CH 4 evolution is maintained for three cycles i. e 15 h of experiment."}], "reactor type": [], "operation mode": []}}
