In order to validate the involvement of CO 2 in the reaction, we carried out the controlled experiment in high purity N 2 atmosphere (entry 8, Table 1).After 1 h reaction under otherwise identical conditions, only 13.4 mol H 2 gas was generated, but without any CO production.Comparing with the fact that when the reaction was operated in CO 2 atmosphere (CO production, 50.4 mol; H 2 production, 11.1 mol), we can clearly conclude that the photoexcited electrons were favored for the reduction of CO 2 rather than proton in the hybrid reaction system, likely due to the preferable adsorption of CO 2 in the metal-organic framework.This result confirmed that the carbon atom of the produced CO was stemmed from CO 2 .To identify the origin of the generated CO, 13 CO 2 was used for the photocatalytic reaction under the same reaction conditions.The produced CO from the isotopic experiment was analyzed by GC-MS.As is shown Fig. 1, after reaction for 1 h, the peak at 3.64 min with the m/z value of 29 in the results of GC-MS analysis was assigned to 13 CO.This study provides a powerful proof that the produced CO was absolutely originated from the deoxygenative conversion of CO 2 , thus ruling out any doubt on the carbon source of the CO formation.After the reaction, to identify whether other potential products had been generated in liquid phase, the reaction solution was filtrated and the supernatant was analyzed by ion chromatograph, GC-MS and 13 C NMR spectroscopy.Results revealed that there was no detectable formic acid, methanol or C C coupling products formed in the reaction system.Fig. 2 depicted the evolution of the reaction products generated from the Co-ZIF-9 promoted CO 2 reduction system as a function of reaction time under visible light irradiation.As can be seen, in the initial 1 h reaction, the generation of CO (50.4 mol) and H 2 (8.5 mol) increased almost linearly with the reaction time.After running the reaction up to 3 h, the accumulated yield of CO and H 2 was increased to 85.6 mol and 38.8 mol, respectively, establishing a photocatalytic turnover number (TON, with respect to Co-ZIF-9) greater than 30 for the reaction system.It is evident that after the photocatalytic reaction for 1 h, the generation rate of the products diminished gradually.We attributed this to the intrinsic chemical instability of the CdS semiconductor 363738 and the depletion/degradation of CO 2 and bpy after long time operations under the reaction conditions, but the Co-ZIF-9 cocatalyst was still stable to preserve its intrinsic catalytic activity, which had been fully confirmed in our previous work 21.To this end, it is further pursued to develop robust, cost-affordable and environmental friendly candidate as the light sensitizer to cooperate with Co-ZIF-9 for creating a more stable catalytic system for CO 2 photofixation, and the work along this direction is under way in our lab.Fig. 3 showed the effect of the adding amount of Co-ZIF-9 on the catalytic activity of CdS for CO 2 reduction, which reflected the high cocatalytic efficiency of Co-ZIF-9 and provided us with some insights into the different reaction pathways for the formation of CO and H 2 .As shown in the figure, we can clearly find that, even with adding a tiny amount (0.2 mg) of Co-ZIF-9 to the CdS photocatalytic system, the catalytic performance for CO evolution was about 45 times enhanced as compared to the cocatalyst-free system (entry 6, Table 1).The finding thus supported the high promotional ability of the Co-ZIF-9 for CO 2 conversion by CdS photocatalysis, which is consistent with our previous paper 21.The yield of CO achieved a maximum value of 50.4 mol when 1 mg Co-ZIF-9 was included in the system.Continuing increase the adding amount of Co-ZIF-9, the production of H 2 increased gradually, but the evolution of CO reduced obviously, which thus disclosed the different reaction pathways for CO and H 2 formations.However, it can be concluded that the adsorption and diffusion of the reactants to the catalytic centers was the main factor that limited the reaction rate when the catalytic system contained the cocatalyst less than 1 mg.While the reaction system involved the cocatalyst more than 1 mg, it is the electron-transfer kinetics that largely determined the reaction rate 21,39.It was found that the total production of CO and H 2 reached a maximum value when 1 mg Co-ZIF-9 was involved in the catalytic system, and thereafter this value stayed almost unchanged even with additional large amount of Co-ZIF-9 added in the CdS reaction system.This result implied that the electron transfer derived from the photoexcitation of the light sensitizer CdS is identified as the rate-limiting step. To evaluate the effect of reaction temperature on the catalytic performance of the system, we operated the CO 2 photoreduction reaction at different reaction temperatures.The results revealed that the reaction temperature drastically influenced both the catalytic activity and the CO selectivity of the reaction system.As shown in Fig. 4 elevated; then, the CO formation was decreased when the temperature was further increased from 40 to 60 C, and thus achieving a maximum CO yield of 56 mol for an hour reaction in the system.The reason for the decrease in CO production at relatively high temperature can be ascribed to the liberation/desorption of the reactant CO 2 from the reaction mixture.However, the effect of reaction temperature on H 2 evolution was different from that of CO formation: the yield of H 2 enhanced exclusively along with the reaction temperature increased within the examined temperature region.Due to the different temperature response toward the evolution of CO and H 2 , the selectivity of CO formation obtained the highest value of 91.2 at 20 C. It was also observed that the total production of CO and H 2 increased substantially as the reaction temperature scaled up from 10 C to 40 C reaching a maximum value of 68.2 mol at 40 C (Fig. 4, Inset).But, the sum of the yields stayed almost unaltered when further increasing the reaction temperature up to 60 C, which may be regarded as another suggestion that the light-induced electron transfer from the CdS photocatalyst is the rate-determining step.Under the optimal reaction conditions, an apparent quantum yield of 1.93 by monochromatic irradiation at 420 nm was obtained for this CO 2 reduction system by CdS photocatalysis. The CO 2 reduction reactions were also performed using various solvents to search for a favorable reaction environment for effectively running CO 2 reduction reaction.Previous literatures 40,41 have documented that solvents containing hybrid atoms (N and/or O) can interact with CO 2 easily through Lewis acid-base interactions and thus will promote the solubilization of CO 2 in the solvents for subsequent reactions, which supports the results of our following experiments.As shown in Fig. 5, when the CO 2 reduction reaction was conducted in the aprotic hybrid-atom-containing solvents such as MeCN, DMF and THF, the reaction was favored to proceed.However, once the catalytic reactions were carried out in DCM and BTF that possess a weak chemical affinity toward CO 2 , the system produced only a small amount of CO, but preferred for H 2 production.With the solvents examined under the reaction conditions in our reaction system, the order of catalytic activity for reducing CO 2 into CO formation is DMF MeCN THF BTF DCM.All the findings demonstrated that selecting appropriate reaction medium is of significant importance for CO 2 conversion. We also performed the CO 2 photoreduction reactions in watercontaining systems and evaluated the effect of adding amount of water on the catalytic performance of the reaction system.Fig. 6 showed that the amount of water contained in the reaction system has a significant effect on both the activity and CO selectivity.It is obvious that when no water was contained in the reaction medium, the catalytic system can unambiguously catalyze CO 2 to CO with a generation rate of 4.2 mol/h, but the catalytic activity was severely slugged under the reaction conditions.Once 2 ml of water was added to the system, more than 10-fold enhancement in the production of CO was achieved as compared with the water-free system, together with obtaining a selectivity of CO formation with a maximum value of 82.If the water content was further enlarged, the evolution of CO was gradually reduced.When the reaction was performed using water as the pure reaction medium, the chemical system was almost inactive to operate the CO 2 -to-CO conversion, but only facilitating H 2 evolution, which can be attributed to the poor chemical affinity of water toward CO 2 molecules.The remarkable influence of water on the catalytic performance of the CO 2 reduction reaction was also observed when using other solvents (DMF, THF, DCM, BTF) as the reaction medium as shown in Fig. 7. To confirm that the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction was really induced by the light excitation of CdS, we conducted the reactions under light irradiation with various wavelengths under the same reaction conditions.Fig. 8 showed the evolution of CO and H 2 as a function of the wavelength of the incident light.We can found that the trend of the production of CO/H 2 matches well with the optical adsorption of the CdS semiconductor instead of Co-ZIF-9 cocatalyst.This observation indicated that the photoreduction of CO 2 is associated with charge generation, separation and subsequent tandem electron transfer catalysis by the photoexcitation of CdS rather than the Co-ZIF-9 cocatalyst that may exhibit the contribution of metal-to-ligand charge transfer for running the reaction. The uniqueness of the Co-ZIF-9 cocatalyst for supporting CO 2 conversion in the CdS system was demonstrated by comparing the cocatalytic activity with that of some other MOFs under the identical reaction conditions.First, to demonstrate the significance of imidazolate-based ligand confined in Co-ZIF-9 for CO 2 reduction in the CdS system, Co-MOF-74 that contains the same metal centers but different organic ligand (2,5-dihydroxyterephthalic acid) was applied as a cocatalyst.Results showed that using Co-MOF-74 as the cocatalyst, the evolution of CO together with H 2 was decreased obviously (Table 2).This observation thereby revealed the crucial role of the benzimidazolate ligand for the capture and activation of CO 2 , originating from the high chemical affinity of imidazolate entities to CO 2 and the stabilizing effect of imidazolate motifs on CO 2 -intermediates 424344.When employing Mn-MOF-74 as a cocatalyst, there was almost no promotional effect in the production of CO and H 2 as compared with the catalyst-free system (entry 6, Table 1), which however strongly reflected that cobalt species are essential for supporting CO 2 conversion reaction in our system, due mainly to its excellent mediating ability for redox catalysis 45,46.Predictably, no obvious CO 2 photoreduction catalysis was occurred, when either Zn-ZIF-8 (ligand: 2-methylimidazole) or Zr-UiO-66-NH 2 (ligand: NH 2 -1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid) was applied as cocatalysts.All these findings strongly underlined the synergetic effect of cobalt and benzimidazolate motifs combined in the harmonious chemical environment of Co-ZIF-9 for promoting CO 2 reduction reaction by CdS photoredox catalysis. In-situ PL measurement was recorded to demonstrate that the Co-ZIF-9 cocatalyst can effectively suppress the recombination of the photo-generated electron-hole pairs in the chemical system.Fig. 9 showed the emission spectra of the CO 2 reduction systems containing different components under excitation at 400 nm.Two broad-band peaks at ca. 530 and 640 nm were observed in the spectra of the reaction mixture.The former relatively strong emission peak is assigned to the direct recombination of photoinduced electron-hole pairs of CdS, while the emission peak at 640 nm is attributed to the radiative recombination at deep trap sites derived from lattice imperfection at the surface 474849.When bpy was added to the reaction solution, the intensities of the two emissions were diminished obviously, indicating that the quench of the excited electrons was effectively suppressed in the reaction system.Furthermore, once Co-ZIF-9 was added to the system, the intensities of the two emission peaks were further reduced significantly.These observations clearly demonstrated that the Co-ZIF-9 cocatalyst can effectively inhibit the recombination of the lightstimulated charge carries on CdS, leading to the high photocatalytic efficiency, and thus reflecting the superior electron transfer ability of Co-ZIF-9 in the hybrid system. To further illustrate the function of the Co-ZIF-9 cocatalyst for promoting electron transfer in CdS photocatalytic system, we investigated the photocurrent generation behavior of the system under visible light irradiation.The photocurrent action spectra were showed in Fig. 10.Comparing the experimental results of the systems including the Co-ZIF-9 cocatalyst or not, we can clearly find that when Co-ZIF-9 was added to the system, the photocurrent generation was enhanced remarkably.It is acknowledged that the diffusion of the photoinduced electrons to the back contact and the acceptance of the photogenerated holes by the hole acceptor were the main reasons for photocurrent generation 50.Therefore, the enhanced photocurrent generation of the system reflected effective transport of light-induced charge carriers, which is also consistent well with the results of the PL measurements.All the observations highlighted the outstanding performance of the Co-ZIF-9 cocatalyst for enhancing charge transfers in the photochemical CO 2 reduction system. A possible reaction mechanism for the CO 2 photocatalytic reduction system was proposed (Scheme 1).Upon visible light irradiation, the electron-hole pairs were generated on the CdS semiconductor.The visible light-induced electrons (e -) migrated to the conduction band of CdS and subsequently transferred to interact with CO 2 molecule that adsorbed by Co-ZIF-9 for the reduction of CO 2 to CO, during which the CO 2 -intermediates were formed and stabilized by the benzimidazole linkers defined in Co-ZIF-9 frameworks.At the same time, the protons existed in the reaction system could also be directly reduced by the excited electrons and thus H 2 formed.The holes (h ) were quenched by TEOA acting as the sacrificial electron donor.The processes can be described briefly as the following equations.Note that triethylamine and ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid can also act as electron donors in the CO 2 reduction system, but the system containing inorganic electron donors like S2-and SO 3 2-are virtually inactive for CO 2 photoreduction."}, {"llm generation": "Co-MOF-74", "source": "First, to demonstrate the significance of imidazolate-based ligand confined in Co-ZIF-9 for CO 2 reduction in the CdS system, Co-MOF-74 that contains the same metal centers but different organic ligand (2,5-dihydroxyterephthalic acid) was applied as a cocatalyst.", "context": "The catalytic performance of the CdS photocatalyzed CO 2 reduction system was investigated under various reaction conditions, and the results were listed in Table 1.As is shown, by visible light irradiation for 1 h reaction under the reaction conditions, the main products detected form the CdS photocatalytic CO 2 reduction system were CO (50.4 mol/h) and H 2 (11.1 mol/h), which is consistent with the observations in our previous work and the literature 8,21.On the contrary, no CO or H 2 was generated in the dark, saying that this reaction is truly photocatalytic (entry 2, Table 1).Meanwhile, if the CdS semiconductor was removed from the reaction system (entry 3, Table 1), the CO 2 reduction reaction a Reaction conditions: CdS (20 mg), bipyridine (10 mg), Co-ZIF-9 (4 mol), solvent (5 ml, MeCN:H2O 3:2), TEOA (1 ml), CO2 (1 atm), 420 nm, 30 was terminated.These results strongly revealed the necessity of CdS photocatalyst for harnessing visible light to drive the reaction.The crucial role of the Co-ZIF-9 cocatalyst on promoting the reduction of CO 2 was demonstrated by the observation that when the Co-ZIF-9 cocatalyst was eliminated from the reaction system, the activity of the catalytic system was dramatically dropped, generating only a few amount of CO and H 2 (entry 6, Table 1).Additionally, the physical mixture of Co-ZIF-9 precursors (Co(NO 3 ) 2 6H 2 O and H-PhIM) was also introduced as cocatalyst for the reaction system to examine their promotional effect for CO 2 photoreduction (entry 7, Table 1).The results showed that the physical mixture of the precursors can cocatalyze the reduction of CO 2 to CO, but with a much lower promotional effect than that of the heterogeneous Co-ZIF-9 cocatalyst.These findings point to the fact that the Co-ZIF-9 cocatalyst can remarkably accelerate the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 to CO by CdS by acting both as a heterogeneous CO 2 absorber/activator and a redox promoter 21. In order to validate the involvement of CO 2 in the reaction, we carried out the controlled experiment in high purity N 2 atmosphere (entry 8, Table 1).After 1 h reaction under otherwise identical conditions, only 13.4 mol H 2 gas was generated, but without any CO production.Comparing with the fact that when the reaction was operated in CO 2 atmosphere (CO production, 50.4 mol; H 2 production, 11.1 mol), we can clearly conclude that the photoexcited electrons were favored for the reduction of CO 2 rather than proton in the hybrid reaction system, likely due to the preferable adsorption of CO 2 in the metal-organic framework.This result confirmed that the carbon atom of the produced CO was stemmed from CO 2 .To identify the origin of the generated CO, 13 CO 2 was used for the photocatalytic reaction under the same reaction conditions.The produced CO from the isotopic experiment was analyzed by GC-MS.As is shown Fig. 1, after reaction for 1 h, the peak at 3.64 min with the m/z value of 29 in the results of GC-MS analysis was assigned to 13 CO.This study provides a powerful proof that the produced CO was absolutely originated from the deoxygenative conversion of CO 2 , thus ruling out any doubt on the carbon source of the CO formation.After the reaction, to identify whether other potential products had been generated in liquid phase, the reaction solution was filtrated and the supernatant was analyzed by ion chromatograph, GC-MS and 13 C NMR spectroscopy.Results revealed that there was no detectable formic acid, methanol or C C coupling products formed in the reaction system.Fig. 2 depicted the evolution of the reaction products generated from the Co-ZIF-9 promoted CO 2 reduction system as a function of reaction time under visible light irradiation.As can be seen, in the initial 1 h reaction, the generation of CO (50.4 mol) and H 2 (8.5 mol) increased almost linearly with the reaction time.After running the reaction up to 3 h, the accumulated yield of CO and H 2 was increased to 85.6 mol and 38.8 mol, respectively, establishing a photocatalytic turnover number (TON, with respect to Co-ZIF-9) greater than 30 for the reaction system.It is evident that after the photocatalytic reaction for 1 h, the generation rate of the products diminished gradually.We attributed this to the intrinsic chemical instability of the CdS semiconductor 363738 and the depletion/degradation of CO 2 and bpy after long time operations under the reaction conditions, but the Co-ZIF-9 cocatalyst was still stable to preserve its intrinsic catalytic activity, which had been fully confirmed in our previous work 21.To this end, it is further pursued to develop robust, cost-affordable and environmental friendly candidate as the light sensitizer to cooperate with Co-ZIF-9 for creating a more stable catalytic system for CO 2 photofixation, and the work along this direction is under way in our lab.Fig. 3 showed the effect of the adding amount of Co-ZIF-9 on the catalytic activity of CdS for CO 2 reduction, which reflected the high cocatalytic efficiency of Co-ZIF-9 and provided us with some insights into the different reaction pathways for the formation of CO and H 2 .As shown in the figure, we can clearly find that, even with adding a tiny amount (0.2 mg) of Co-ZIF-9 to the CdS photocatalytic system, the catalytic performance for CO evolution was about 45 times enhanced as compared to the cocatalyst-free system (entry 6, Table 1).The finding thus supported the high promotional ability of the Co-ZIF-9 for CO 2 conversion by CdS photocatalysis, which is consistent with our previous paper 21.The yield of CO achieved a maximum value of 50.4 mol when 1 mg Co-ZIF-9 was included in the system.Continuing increase the adding amount of Co-ZIF-9, the production of H 2 increased gradually, but the evolution of CO reduced obviously, which thus disclosed the different reaction pathways for CO and H 2 formations.However, it can be concluded that the adsorption and diffusion of the reactants to the catalytic centers was the main factor that limited the reaction rate when the catalytic system contained the cocatalyst less than 1 mg.While the reaction system involved the cocatalyst more than 1 mg, it is the electron-transfer kinetics that largely determined the reaction rate 21,39.It was found that the total production of CO and H 2 reached a maximum value when 1 mg Co-ZIF-9 was involved in the catalytic system, and thereafter this value stayed almost unchanged even with additional large amount of Co-ZIF-9 added in the CdS reaction system.This result implied that the electron transfer derived from the photoexcitation of the light sensitizer CdS is identified as the rate-limiting step. To evaluate the effect of reaction temperature on the catalytic performance of the system, we operated the CO 2 photoreduction reaction at different reaction temperatures.The results revealed that the reaction temperature drastically influenced both the catalytic activity and the CO selectivity of the reaction system.As shown in Fig. 4 elevated; then, the CO formation was decreased when the temperature was further increased from 40 to 60 C, and thus achieving a maximum CO yield of 56 mol for an hour reaction in the system.The reason for the decrease in CO production at relatively high temperature can be ascribed to the liberation/desorption of the reactant CO 2 from the reaction mixture.However, the effect of reaction temperature on H 2 evolution was different from that of CO formation: the yield of H 2 enhanced exclusively along with the reaction temperature increased within the examined temperature region.Due to the different temperature response toward the evolution of CO and H 2 , the selectivity of CO formation obtained the highest value of 91.2 at 20 C. It was also observed that the total production of CO and H 2 increased substantially as the reaction temperature scaled up from 10 C to 40 C reaching a maximum value of 68.2 mol at 40 C (Fig. 4, Inset).But, the sum of the yields stayed almost unaltered when further increasing the reaction temperature up to 60 C, which may be regarded as another suggestion that the light-induced electron transfer from the CdS photocatalyst is the rate-determining step.Under the optimal reaction conditions, an apparent quantum yield of 1.93 by monochromatic irradiation at 420 nm was obtained for this CO 2 reduction system by CdS photocatalysis. The CO 2 reduction reactions were also performed using various solvents to search for a favorable reaction environment for effectively running CO 2 reduction reaction.Previous literatures 40,41 have documented that solvents containing hybrid atoms (N and/or O) can interact with CO 2 easily through Lewis acid-base interactions and thus will promote the solubilization of CO 2 in the solvents for subsequent reactions, which supports the results of our following experiments.As shown in Fig. 5, when the CO 2 reduction reaction was conducted in the aprotic hybrid-atom-containing solvents such as MeCN, DMF and THF, the reaction was favored to proceed.However, once the catalytic reactions were carried out in DCM and BTF that possess a weak chemical affinity toward CO 2 , the system produced only a small amount of CO, but preferred for H 2 production.With the solvents examined under the reaction conditions in our reaction system, the order of catalytic activity for reducing CO 2 into CO formation is DMF MeCN THF BTF DCM.All the findings demonstrated that selecting appropriate reaction medium is of significant importance for CO 2 conversion. We also performed the CO 2 photoreduction reactions in watercontaining systems and evaluated the effect of adding amount of water on the catalytic performance of the reaction system.Fig. 6 showed that the amount of water contained in the reaction system has a significant effect on both the activity and CO selectivity.It is obvious that when no water was contained in the reaction medium, the catalytic system can unambiguously catalyze CO 2 to CO with a generation rate of 4.2 mol/h, but the catalytic activity was severely slugged under the reaction conditions.Once 2 ml of water was added to the system, more than 10-fold enhancement in the production of CO was achieved as compared with the water-free system, together with obtaining a selectivity of CO formation with a maximum value of 82.If the water content was further enlarged, the evolution of CO was gradually reduced.When the reaction was performed using water as the pure reaction medium, the chemical system was almost inactive to operate the CO 2 -to-CO conversion, but only facilitating H 2 evolution, which can be attributed to the poor chemical affinity of water toward CO 2 molecules.The remarkable influence of water on the catalytic performance of the CO 2 reduction reaction was also observed when using other solvents (DMF, THF, DCM, BTF) as the reaction medium as shown in Fig. 7. To confirm that the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction was really induced by the light excitation of CdS, we conducted the reactions under light irradiation with various wavelengths under the same reaction conditions.Fig. 8 showed the evolution of CO and H 2 as a function of the wavelength of the incident light.We can found that the trend of the production of CO/H 2 matches well with the optical adsorption of the CdS semiconductor instead of Co-ZIF-9 cocatalyst.This observation indicated that the photoreduction of CO 2 is associated with charge generation, separation and subsequent tandem electron transfer catalysis by the photoexcitation of CdS rather than the Co-ZIF-9 cocatalyst that may exhibit the contribution of metal-to-ligand charge transfer for running the reaction. The uniqueness of the Co-ZIF-9 cocatalyst for supporting CO 2 conversion in the CdS system was demonstrated by comparing the cocatalytic activity with that of some other MOFs under the identical reaction conditions.First, to demonstrate the significance of imidazolate-based ligand confined in Co-ZIF-9 for CO 2 reduction in the CdS system, Co-MOF-74 that contains the same metal centers but different organic ligand (2,5-dihydroxyterephthalic acid) was applied as a cocatalyst.Results showed that using Co-MOF-74 as the cocatalyst, the evolution of CO together with H 2 was decreased obviously (Table 2).This observation thereby revealed the crucial role of the benzimidazolate ligand for the capture and activation of CO 2 , originating from the high chemical affinity of imidazolate entities to CO 2 and the stabilizing effect of imidazolate motifs on CO 2 -intermediates 424344.When employing Mn-MOF-74 as a cocatalyst, there was almost no promotional effect in the production of CO and H 2 as compared with the catalyst-free system (entry 6, Table 1), which however strongly reflected that cobalt species are essential for supporting CO 2 conversion reaction in our system, due mainly to its excellent mediating ability for redox catalysis 45,46.Predictably, no obvious CO 2 photoreduction catalysis was occurred, when either Zn-ZIF-8 (ligand: 2-methylimidazole) or Zr-UiO-66-NH 2 (ligand: NH 2 -1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid) was applied as cocatalysts.All these findings strongly underlined the synergetic effect of cobalt and benzimidazolate motifs combined in the harmonious chemical environment of Co-ZIF-9 for promoting CO 2 reduction reaction by CdS photoredox catalysis. In-situ PL measurement was recorded to demonstrate that the Co-ZIF-9 cocatalyst can effectively suppress the recombination of the photo-generated electron-hole pairs in the chemical system.Fig. 9 showed the emission spectra of the CO 2 reduction systems containing different components under excitation at 400 nm.Two broad-band peaks at ca. 530 and 640 nm were observed in the spectra of the reaction mixture.The former relatively strong emission peak is assigned to the direct recombination of photoinduced electron-hole pairs of CdS, while the emission peak at 640 nm is attributed to the radiative recombination at deep trap sites derived from lattice imperfection at the surface 474849.When bpy was added to the reaction solution, the intensities of the two emissions were diminished obviously, indicating that the quench of the excited electrons was effectively suppressed in the reaction system.Furthermore, once Co-ZIF-9 was added to the system, the intensities of the two emission peaks were further reduced significantly.These observations clearly demonstrated that the Co-ZIF-9 cocatalyst can effectively inhibit the recombination of the lightstimulated charge carries on CdS, leading to the high photocatalytic efficiency, and thus reflecting the superior electron transfer ability of Co-ZIF-9 in the hybrid system. To further illustrate the function of the Co-ZIF-9 cocatalyst for promoting electron transfer in CdS photocatalytic system, we investigated the photocurrent generation behavior of the system under visible light irradiation.The photocurrent action spectra were showed in Fig. 10.Comparing the experimental results of the systems including the Co-ZIF-9 cocatalyst or not, we can clearly find that when Co-ZIF-9 was added to the system, the photocurrent generation was enhanced remarkably.It is acknowledged that the diffusion of the photoinduced electrons to the back contact and the acceptance of the photogenerated holes by the hole acceptor were the main reasons for photocurrent generation 50.Therefore, the enhanced photocurrent generation of the system reflected effective transport of light-induced charge carriers, which is also consistent well with the results of the PL measurements.All the observations highlighted the outstanding performance of the Co-ZIF-9 cocatalyst for enhancing charge transfers in the photochemical CO 2 reduction system.

A possible reaction mechanism for the CO 2 photocatalytic reduction system was proposed (Scheme 1).Upon visible light irradiation, the electron-hole pairs were generated on the CdS semiconductor.The visible light-induced electrons (e -) migrated to the conduction band of CdS and subsequently transferred to interact with CO 2 molecule that adsorbed by Co-ZIF-9 for the reduction of CO 2 to CO, during which the CO 2 -intermediates were formed and stabilized by the benzimidazole linkers defined in Co-ZIF-9 frameworks.At the same time, the protons existed in the reaction system could also be directly reduced by the excited electrons and thus H 2 formed.The holes (h ) were quenched by TEOA acting as the sacrificial electron donor.The processes can be described briefly as the following equations.Note that triethylamine and ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid can also act as electron donors in the CO 2 reduction system, but the system containing inorganic electron donors like S2-and SO 3 2-are virtually inactive for CO 2 photoreduction."}, {"llm generation": "Zn-ZIF-8", "source": "Predictably, no obvious CO 2 photoreduction catalysis was occurred, when either Zn-ZIF-8 (ligand: 2-methylimidazole) or Zr-UiO-66-NH 2 (ligand: NH 2 -1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid) was applied as cocatalysts.", "context": "The catalytic performance of the CdS photocatalyzed CO 2 reduction system was investigated under various reaction conditions, and the results were listed in Table 1.As is shown, by visible light irradiation for 1 h reaction under the reaction conditions, the main products detected form the CdS photocatalytic CO 2 reduction system were CO (50.4 mol/h) and H 2 (11.1 mol/h), which is consistent with the observations in our previous work and the literature 8,21.On the contrary, no CO or H 2 was generated in the dark, saying that this reaction is truly photocatalytic (entry 2, Table 1).Meanwhile, if the CdS semiconductor was removed from the reaction system (entry 3, Table 1), the CO 2 reduction reaction a Reaction conditions: CdS (20 mg), bipyridine (10 mg), Co-ZIF-9 (4 mol), solvent (5 ml, MeCN:H2O 3:2), TEOA (1 ml), CO2 (1 atm), 420 nm, 30 was terminated.These results strongly revealed the necessity of CdS photocatalyst for harnessing visible light to drive the reaction.The crucial role of the Co-ZIF-9 cocatalyst on promoting the reduction of CO 2 was demonstrated by the observation that when the Co-ZIF-9 cocatalyst was eliminated from the reaction system, the activity of the catalytic system was dramatically dropped, generating only a few amount of CO and H 2 (entry 6, Table 1).Additionally, the physical mixture of Co-ZIF-9 precursors (Co(NO 3 ) 2 6H 2 O and H-PhIM) was also introduced as cocatalyst for the reaction system to examine their promotional effect for CO 2 photoreduction (entry 7, Table 1).The results showed that the physical mixture of the precursors can cocatalyze the reduction of CO 2 to CO, but with a much lower promotional effect than that of the heterogeneous Co-ZIF-9 cocatalyst.These findings point to the fact that the Co-ZIF-9 cocatalyst can remarkably accelerate the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 to CO by CdS by acting both as a heterogeneous CO 2 absorber/activator and a redox promoter 21. In order to validate the involvement of CO 2 in the reaction, we carried out the controlled experiment in high purity N 2 atmosphere (entry 8, Table 1).After 1 h reaction under otherwise identical conditions, only 13.4 mol H 2 gas was generated, but without any CO production.Comparing with the fact that when the reaction was operated in CO 2 atmosphere (CO production, 50.4 mol; H 2 production, 11.1 mol), we can clearly conclude that the photoexcited electrons were favored for the reduction of CO 2 rather than proton in the hybrid reaction system, likely due to the preferable adsorption of CO 2 in the metal-organic framework.This result confirmed that the carbon atom of the produced CO was stemmed from CO 2 .To identify the origin of the generated CO, 13 CO 2 was used for the photocatalytic reaction under the same reaction conditions.The produced CO from the isotopic experiment was analyzed by GC-MS.As is shown Fig. 1, after reaction for 1 h, the peak at 3.64 min with the m/z value of 29 in the results of GC-MS analysis was assigned to 13 CO.This study provides a powerful proof that the produced CO was absolutely originated from the deoxygenative conversion of CO 2 , thus ruling out any doubt on the carbon source of the CO formation.After the reaction, to identify whether other potential products had been generated in liquid phase, the reaction solution was filtrated and the supernatant was analyzed by ion chromatograph, GC-MS and 13 C NMR spectroscopy.Results revealed that there was no detectable formic acid, methanol or C C coupling products formed in the reaction system.Fig. 2 depicted the evolution of the reaction products generated from the Co-ZIF-9 promoted CO 2 reduction system as a function of reaction time under visible light irradiation.As can be seen, in the initial 1 h reaction, the generation of CO (50.4 mol) and H 2 (8.5 mol) increased almost linearly with the reaction time.After running the reaction up to 3 h, the accumulated yield of CO and H 2 was increased to 85.6 mol and 38.8 mol, respectively, establishing a photocatalytic turnover number (TON, with respect to Co-ZIF-9) greater than 30 for the reaction system.It is evident that after the photocatalytic reaction for 1 h, the generation rate of the products diminished gradually.We attributed this to the intrinsic chemical instability of the CdS semiconductor 363738 and the depletion/degradation of CO 2 and bpy after long time operations under the reaction conditions, but the Co-ZIF-9 cocatalyst was still stable to preserve its intrinsic catalytic activity, which had been fully confirmed in our previous work 21.To this end, it is further pursued to develop robust, cost-affordable and environmental friendly candidate as the light sensitizer to cooperate with Co-ZIF-9 for creating a more stable catalytic system for CO 2 photofixation, and the work along this direction is under way in our lab.Fig. 3 showed the effect of the adding amount of Co-ZIF-9 on the catalytic activity of CdS for CO 2 reduction, which reflected the high cocatalytic efficiency of Co-ZIF-9 and provided us with some insights into the different reaction pathways for the formation of CO and H 2 .As shown in the figure, we can clearly find that, even with adding a tiny amount (0.2 mg) of Co-ZIF-9 to the CdS photocatalytic system, the catalytic performance for CO evolution was about 45 times enhanced as compared to the cocatalyst-free system (entry 6, Table 1).The finding thus supported the high promotional ability of the Co-ZIF-9 for CO 2 conversion by CdS photocatalysis, which is consistent with our previous paper 21.The yield of CO achieved a maximum value of 50.4 mol when 1 mg Co-ZIF-9 was included in the system.Continuing increase the adding amount of Co-ZIF-9, the production of H 2 increased gradually, but the evolution of CO reduced obviously, which thus disclosed the different reaction pathways for CO and H 2 formations.However, it can be concluded that the adsorption and diffusion of the reactants to the catalytic centers was the main factor that limited the reaction rate when the catalytic system contained the cocatalyst less than 1 mg.While the reaction system involved the cocatalyst more than 1 mg, it is the electron-transfer kinetics that largely determined the reaction rate 21,39.It was found that the total production of CO and H 2 reached a maximum value when 1 mg Co-ZIF-9 was involved in the catalytic system, and thereafter this value stayed almost unchanged even with additional large amount of Co-ZIF-9 added in the CdS reaction system.This result implied that the electron transfer derived from the photoexcitation of the light sensitizer CdS is identified as the rate-limiting step. To evaluate the effect of reaction temperature on the catalytic performance of the system, we operated the CO 2 photoreduction reaction at different reaction temperatures.The results revealed that the reaction temperature drastically influenced both the catalytic activity and the CO selectivity of the reaction system.As shown in Fig. 4 elevated; then, the CO formation was decreased when the temperature was further increased from 40 to 60 C, and thus achieving a maximum CO yield of 56 mol for an hour reaction in the system.The reason for the decrease in CO production at relatively high temperature can be ascribed to the liberation/desorption of the reactant CO 2 from the reaction mixture.However, the effect of reaction temperature on H 2 evolution was different from that of CO formation: the yield of H 2 enhanced exclusively along with the reaction temperature increased within the examined temperature region.Due to the different temperature response toward the evolution of CO and H 2 , the selectivity of CO formation obtained the highest value of 91.2 at 20 C. It was also observed that the total production of CO and H 2 increased substantially as the reaction temperature scaled up from 10 C to 40 C reaching a maximum value of 68.2 mol at 40 C (Fig. 4, Inset).But, the sum of the yields stayed almost unaltered when further increasing the reaction temperature up to 60 C, which may be regarded as another suggestion that the light-induced electron transfer from the CdS photocatalyst is the rate-determining step.Under the optimal reaction conditions, an apparent quantum yield of 1.93 by monochromatic irradiation at 420 nm was obtained for this CO 2 reduction system by CdS photocatalysis. The CO 2 reduction reactions were also performed using various solvents to search for a favorable reaction environment for effectively running CO 2 reduction reaction.Previous literatures 40,41 have documented that solvents containing hybrid atoms (N and/or O) can interact with CO 2 easily through Lewis acid-base interactions and thus will promote the solubilization of CO 2 in the solvents for subsequent reactions, which supports the results of our following experiments.As shown in Fig. 5, when the CO 2 reduction reaction was conducted in the aprotic hybrid-atom-containing solvents such as MeCN, DMF and THF, the reaction was favored to proceed.However, once the catalytic reactions were carried out in DCM and BTF that possess a weak chemical affinity toward CO 2 , the system produced only a small amount of CO, but preferred for H 2 production.With the solvents examined under the reaction conditions in our reaction system, the order of catalytic activity for reducing CO 2 into CO formation is DMF MeCN THF BTF DCM.All the findings demonstrated that selecting appropriate reaction medium is of significant importance for CO 2 conversion. We also performed the CO 2 photoreduction reactions in watercontaining systems and evaluated the effect of adding amount of water on the catalytic performance of the reaction system.Fig. 6 showed that the amount of water contained in the reaction system has a significant effect on both the activity and CO selectivity.It is obvious that when no water was contained in the reaction medium, the catalytic system can unambiguously catalyze CO 2 to CO with a generation rate of 4.2 mol/h, but the catalytic activity was severely slugged under the reaction conditions.Once 2 ml of water was added to the system, more than 10-fold enhancement in the production of CO was achieved as compared with the water-free system, together with obtaining a selectivity of CO formation with a maximum value of 82.If the water content was further enlarged, the evolution of CO was gradually reduced.When the reaction was performed using water as the pure reaction medium, the chemical system was almost inactive to operate the CO 2 -to-CO conversion, but only facilitating H 2 evolution, which can be attributed to the poor chemical affinity of water toward CO 2 molecules.The remarkable influence of water on the catalytic performance of the CO 2 reduction reaction was also observed when using other solvents (DMF, THF, DCM, BTF) as the reaction medium as shown in Fig. 7. To confirm that the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction was really induced by the light excitation of CdS, we conducted the reactions under light irradiation with various wavelengths under the same reaction conditions.Fig. 8 showed the evolution of CO and H 2 as a function of the wavelength of the incident light.We can found that the trend of the production of CO/H 2 matches well with the optical adsorption of the CdS semiconductor instead of Co-ZIF-9 cocatalyst.This observation indicated that the photoreduction of CO 2 is associated with charge generation, separation and subsequent tandem electron transfer catalysis by the photoexcitation of CdS rather than the Co-ZIF-9 cocatalyst that may exhibit the contribution of metal-to-ligand charge transfer for running the reaction. The uniqueness of the Co-ZIF-9 cocatalyst for supporting CO 2 conversion in the CdS system was demonstrated by comparing the cocatalytic activity with that of some other MOFs under the identical reaction conditions.First, to demonstrate the significance of imidazolate-based ligand confined in Co-ZIF-9 for CO 2 reduction in the CdS system, Co-MOF-74 that contains the same metal centers but different organic ligand (2,5-dihydroxyterephthalic acid) was applied as a cocatalyst.Results showed that using Co-MOF-74 as the cocatalyst, the evolution of CO together with H 2 was decreased obviously (Table 2).This observation thereby revealed the crucial role of the benzimidazolate ligand for the capture and activation of CO 2 , originating from the high chemical affinity of imidazolate entities to CO 2 and the stabilizing effect of imidazolate motifs on CO 2 -intermediates 424344.When employing Mn-MOF-74 as a cocatalyst, there was almost no promotional effect in the production of CO and H 2 as compared with the catalyst-free system (entry 6, Table 1), which however strongly reflected that cobalt species are essential for supporting CO 2 conversion reaction in our system, due mainly to its excellent mediating ability for redox catalysis 45,46.Predictably, no obvious CO 2 photoreduction catalysis was occurred, when either Zn-ZIF-8 (ligand: 2-methylimidazole) or Zr-UiO-66-NH 2 (ligand: NH 2 -1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid) was applied as cocatalysts.All these findings strongly underlined the synergetic effect of cobalt and benzimidazolate motifs combined in the harmonious chemical environment of Co-ZIF-9 for promoting CO 2 reduction reaction by CdS photoredox catalysis. In-situ PL measurement was recorded to demonstrate that the Co-ZIF-9 cocatalyst can effectively suppress the recombination of the photo-generated electron-hole pairs in the chemical system.Fig. 9 showed the emission spectra of the CO 2 reduction systems containing different components under excitation at 400 nm.Two broad-band peaks at ca. 530 and 640 nm were observed in the spectra of the reaction mixture.The former relatively strong emission peak is assigned to the direct recombination of photoinduced electron-hole pairs of CdS, while the emission peak at 640 nm is attributed to the radiative recombination at deep trap sites derived from lattice imperfection at the surface 474849.When bpy was added to the reaction solution, the intensities of the two emissions were diminished obviously, indicating that the quench of the excited electrons was effectively suppressed in the reaction system.Furthermore, once Co-ZIF-9 was added to the system, the intensities of the two emission peaks were further reduced significantly.These observations clearly demonstrated that the Co-ZIF-9 cocatalyst can effectively inhibit the recombination of the lightstimulated charge carries on CdS, leading to the high photocatalytic efficiency, and thus reflecting the superior electron transfer ability of Co-ZIF-9 in the hybrid system.

A possible reaction mechanism for the CO 2 photocatalytic reduction system was proposed (Scheme 1).Upon visible light irradiation, the electron-hole pairs were generated on the CdS semiconductor.The visible light-induced electrons (e -) migrated to the conduction band of CdS and subsequently transferred to interact with CO 2 molecule that adsorbed by Co-ZIF-9 for the reduction of CO 2 to CO, during which the CO 2 -intermediates were formed and stabilized by the benzimidazole linkers defined in Co-ZIF-9 frameworks.At the same time, the protons existed in the reaction system could also be directly reduced by the excited electrons and thus H 2 formed.The holes (h ) were quenched by TEOA acting as the sacrificial electron donor.The processes can be described briefly as the following equations.Note that triethylamine and ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid can also act as electron donors in the CO 2 reduction system, but the system containing inorganic electron donors like S2-and SO 3 2-are virtually inactive for CO 2 photoreduction."}, {"llm generation": "Co-ZIF-9", "source": "A noble-metal-free photocatalytic CO 2 reduction system was established by utilizing the cobalt-containing zeolitic imidazolate framework Co-ZIF-9 as a cocatalyst coupled with CdS semiconductor as the light harvester under benign reaction conditions.", "context": "A noble-metal-free photocatalytic CO 2 reduction system was established by utilizing the cobalt-containing zeolitic imidazolate framework Co-ZIF-9 as a cocatalyst coupled with CdS semiconductor as the light harvester under benign reaction conditions. 13CO 2 isotropic experiments identified that the carbon source of the produced CO was CO 2 .Various reaction conditions were investigated to operate effective CO 2 conversions, and under the optimal conditions, as apparent quantum yield of 1.93 was achieved for the photochemical system.In-situ PL measurements and the photocurrent generation revealed the function of Co-ZIF-9 for promoting electron transfers in the CdS photocatalytic system.We believed that the work presented here will bring new opportunities in CO 2 photoconversion by merging the merits of metal-organic cocatalysts and semiconductor light harvesters.
