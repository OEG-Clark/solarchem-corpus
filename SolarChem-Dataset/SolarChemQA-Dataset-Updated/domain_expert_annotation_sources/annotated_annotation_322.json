Fig. 4 shows HR-TEM images of TiO 2 and Ni-TiO 2 (0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 mol).It is seen that the prepared nanoparticles composed of rhombic shape with size ranging from 10 nm to 20 nm.TEM results do not illustrate any obvious difference in the morphological features between Ni-TiO 2 and pure TiO 2 .The nickel (Ni) content in TiO 2 was checked by EDS.It was not detected in Ni-TiO 2 (0.1 mol) and Ni-TiO 2 (0.5 mol), because of its very low concentration.The detection limit of EDS is also the main factor.However, the Ni content was successfully examined in (1.0 mol).Table 1 shows the atomic composition of elements in Ni-TiO 2 (1.0 mol). The distribution of elements in Ni-TiO 2 (1.0 mol) was confirmed using HR-TEM elemental mapping analysis and the results are shown in Fig. 5.It can be clearly seen that Ti, O, and Ni elements are truly existed in Ni-TiO 2 (1.0 mol). The N 2 adsorption and desorption isotherms and BET surface area of TiO 2 and Ni-TiO 2 are shown in Fig. 6 and Table 2 respectively.The isotherms of the catalysts are similar to type III curves, hence the prepared catalysts are non porous materials 30.The BET surface area of Ni-TiO 2 (0.1 mol) is higher than that of other catalysts. The BET surface area of TiO 2 is increased with increasing of Ni content.On the other hand, the BET surface area of TiO 2 is decreased at high Ni content.This is ascribed to the following reason: The size of Ni ions is smaller than that of Ti ions.However, when large amount of Ni component is added, the pores of TiO 2 are blocked 31.It is important to study the mobility of nanoparticles in water because the reaction was carried out in liquid phase.Fig. 6 shows the influence of pH on the positions of zeta potential distribution of catalysts.The zeta potentials of TiO 2 and Ni-TiO 2 suspensions decreased considerably when increasing pH.The surface charges of materials surface is changed from positive in acid solution to negative in base solution.The isoelectric point of Ni-TiO 2 and TiO 2 was respectively at pH 3.8 and 3.9 which aggregation was considerable.The zeta potential value of Ni-TiO 2 was about A30 mV at pH 7. It explains that the catalysts were stably dispersed in solution during reaction (see Fig. 7). Fig. 8 shows the UV-visible absorbance spectra and Tauc plots of TiO 2 and Ni-TiO 2 .The absorption of pure TiO 2 appears at about 360 nm.For Ni-TiO 2 , the absorption is red shifted with increasing nickel component from 0.1 to 1.0 mol.A hump in the range of 600-800 nm at high Ni content is resulted from the formation of NiO during synthesis of Ni-TiO 2 32.The band gap was calculated using Tauc equation shown in Eq. ( 1) 33. where a, m, A and E bg are the absorption coefficient, light frequency, a constant and band gap energy, respectively.The band gap was estimated from the point of contact of the tangents to the Tauc plots ((ahm) 1/2 versus hm).The band gap of TiO 2 , Ni-TiO 2 (0.1 mol), Ni-TiO 2 (0.5 mol) and Ni-TiO 2 (1.0 mol) were found to be 3.16 eV, 3.11 eV, 3.06 eV and 3.00 eV respectively (Table 2).Fig. 9 shows photoluminescence spectra of each catalyst to understand the recombination of electron and holes pairs.In general, the photocatalytic activity decreases when the PL intensity increases.The catalysts exhibit a strong PL signal about 440 nm with the exited wavelength of 325 nm.The visible spectral emission at 600-700 nm may be related to singly ionized oxygen vacancies.It results from the radiative recombination of photogenerated holes with electrons occupying the oxygen vacancy 34.The PL emission spectrum of Ni-TiO 2 is decreased when compared to that of TiO 2 .This is attributed to nickel atoms capture the excited electrons and reduce the electron-hole recombination process 35.The PL intensity of Ni-TiO 2 (0.1 mol) is the smallest when compared to other catalysts.However, the PL intensity is increased at higher nickel content.It indicates that high content of Ni do not act as a trapping site to capture the photogenerated electron from TiO 2 conduction band 36.Fig. 10 shows the CO 2 -TPD profile of TiO 2 and Ni-TiO 2 samples.In general, basicity of catalysts is confirmed from CO 2 -TPD.There is only one peak for pure TiO 2 at 573 K 37, but two peaks are observed at about 523 K (small) and 573 (highest) for Ni-TiO 2 .That peak intensity of Ni-TiO 2 is stronger and shifted to high temperature than that of TiO 2 .Therefore addition of nickel increases the interaction between catalysts surface and CO 2 . Methane yield was used to evaluate the performance of the catalysts.Fig. 11 summarizes the methane yield over TiO 2 and Ni-TiO 2 photocatalysts in circulated liquid photoreactor system.The methane was just produced when light on and the highest amount was produced at the first time.After 60 min irradiation, the observed methane yields of catalysts order was: Ni-TiO 2 (0.1 mol) Ni-TiO 2 (0.5 mol) TiO 2 Ni-TiO 2 (1.0 mol).The best catalyst was Ni-TiO 2 (0.1 mol) with a maximum methane yield about 14 lmol/g catal during 60 min.However, the yield of methane was gradually decreased in repeated reaction time.This decrease suggests the gradual deactivation of catalysts, and a phenomenon was reported in the literature 38.One of possible reasons is the saturation of the adsorption site which can be activated on the catalysts surface by the intermediate products 39."}, {"llm generation": "TiO 2 and Ni-TiO 2", "source": "TiO 2 and Ni-TiO 2 catalysts were composed of anatase structure with size in the range of 10-20 nm.", "context": "In this study, TiO 2 nanoparticles incorporated with nickel was synthesized by a solvothermal method.TiO 2 and Ni-TiO 2 catalysts were composed of anatase structure with size in the range of 10-20 nm.The nanoparticles have large surface area that can be adsorbed with reactant (CO 2 ).The band gap of TiO 2 was decreased when increasing the nickel concentration.The yield of methane on Ni-TiO 2 (0.1 mol) was about 14 lmol/g catal during 1 h.However, the yield of methane is low at high nickel content.It is caused by the decrease in surface area and increase of electron-hole recombination process.The photoreduction of CO 2 is one of the most a fair way to transform CO 2 into useful compounds.The efficiency is considerably low, and further research needs to improve methane yield.

Fig. 4 shows HR-TEM images of TiO 2 and Ni-TiO 2 (0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 mol).It is seen that the prepared nanoparticles composed of rhombic shape with size ranging from 10 nm to 20 nm.TEM results do not illustrate any obvious difference in the morphological features between Ni-TiO 2 and pure TiO 2 .The nickel (Ni) content in TiO 2 was checked by EDS.It was not detected in Ni-TiO 2 (0.1 mol) and Ni-TiO 2 (0.5 mol), because of its very low concentration.The detection limit of EDS is also the main factor.However, the Ni content was successfully examined in (1.0 mol).Table 1 shows the atomic composition of elements in Ni-TiO 2 (1.0 mol). The distribution of elements in Ni-TiO 2 (1.0 mol) was confirmed using HR-TEM elemental mapping analysis and the results are shown in Fig. 5.It can be clearly seen that Ti, O, and Ni elements are truly existed in Ni-TiO 2 (1.0 mol). The N 2 adsorption and desorption isotherms and BET surface area of TiO 2 and Ni-TiO 2 are shown in Fig. 6 and Table 2 respectively.The isotherms of the catalysts are similar to type III curves, hence the prepared catalysts are non porous materials 30.The BET surface area of Ni-TiO 2 (0.1 mol) is higher than that of other catalysts. The BET surface area of TiO 2 is increased with increasing of Ni content.On the other hand, the BET surface area of TiO 2 is decreased at high Ni content.This is ascribed to the following reason: The size of Ni ions is smaller than that of Ti ions.However, when large amount of Ni component is added, the pores of TiO 2 are blocked 31.It is important to study the mobility of nanoparticles in water because the reaction was carried out in liquid phase.Fig. 6 shows the influence of pH on the positions of zeta potential distribution of catalysts.The zeta potentials of TiO 2 and Ni-TiO 2 suspensions decreased considerably when increasing pH.The surface charges of materials surface is changed from positive in acid solution to negative in base solution.The isoelectric point of Ni-TiO 2 and TiO 2 was respectively at pH 3.8 and 3.9 which aggregation was considerable.The zeta potential value of Ni-TiO 2 was about A30 mV at pH 7. It explains that the catalysts were stably dispersed in solution during reaction (see Fig. 7). Fig. 8 shows the UV-visible absorbance spectra and Tauc plots of TiO 2 and Ni-TiO 2 .The absorption of pure TiO 2 appears at about 360 nm.For Ni-TiO 2 , the absorption is red shifted with increasing nickel component from 0.1 to 1.0 mol.A hump in the range of 600-800 nm at high Ni content is resulted from the formation of NiO during synthesis of Ni-TiO 2 32.The band gap was calculated using Tauc equation shown in Eq. ( 1) 33. where a, m, A and E bg are the absorption coefficient, light frequency, a constant and band gap energy, respectively.The band gap was estimated from the point of contact of the tangents to the Tauc plots ((ahm) 1/2 versus hm).The band gap of TiO 2 , Ni-TiO 2 (0.1 mol), Ni-TiO 2 (0.5 mol) and Ni-TiO 2 (1.0 mol) were found to be 3.16 eV, 3.11 eV, 3.06 eV and 3.00 eV respectively (Table 2).Fig. 9 shows photoluminescence spectra of each catalyst to understand the recombination of electron and holes pairs.In general, the photocatalytic activity decreases when the PL intensity increases.The catalysts exhibit a strong PL signal about 440 nm with the exited wavelength of 325 nm.The visible spectral emission at 600-700 nm may be related to singly ionized oxygen vacancies.It results from the radiative recombination of photogenerated holes with electrons occupying the oxygen vacancy 34.The PL emission spectrum of Ni-TiO 2 is decreased when compared to that of TiO 2 .This is attributed to nickel atoms capture the excited electrons and reduce the electron-hole recombination process 35.The PL intensity of Ni-TiO 2 (0.1 mol) is the smallest when compared to other catalysts.However, the PL intensity is increased at higher nickel content.It indicates that high content of Ni do not act as a trapping site to capture the photogenerated electron from TiO 2 conduction band 36.Fig. 10 shows the CO 2 -TPD profile of TiO 2 and Ni-TiO 2 samples.In general, basicity of catalysts is confirmed from CO 2 -TPD.There is only one peak for pure TiO 2 at 573 K 37, but two peaks are observed at about 523 K (small) and 573 (highest) for Ni-TiO 2 .That peak intensity of Ni-TiO 2 is stronger and shifted to high temperature than that of TiO 2 .Therefore addition of nickel increases the interaction between catalysts surface and CO 2 . Methane yield was used to evaluate the performance of the catalysts.Fig. 11 summarizes the methane yield over TiO 2 and Ni-TiO 2 photocatalysts in circulated liquid photoreactor system.The methane was just produced when light on and the highest amount was produced at the first time.After 60 min irradiation, the observed methane yields of catalysts order was: Ni-TiO 2 (0.1 mol) Ni-TiO 2 (0.5 mol) TiO 2 Ni-TiO 2 (1.0 mol).The best catalyst was Ni-TiO 2 (0.1 mol) with a maximum methane yield about 14 lmol/g catal during 60 min.However, the yield of methane was gradually decreased in repeated reaction time.This decrease suggests the gradual deactivation of catalysts, and a phenomenon was reported in the literature 38.One of possible reasons is the saturation of the adsorption site which can be activated on the catalysts surface by the intermediate products 39."}, {"llm generation": "UV-visible", "source": "Fig. 8.

( 1) 33. where a, m, A and E bg are the absorption coefficient, light frequency, a constant and band gap energy, respectively.The band gap was estimated from the point of contact of the tangents to the Tauc plots ((ahm) 1/2 versus hm).The band gap of TiO 2 , Ni-TiO 2 (0.1 mol), Ni-TiO 2 (0.5 mol) and Ni-TiO 2 (1.0 mol) were found to be 3.16 eV, 3.11 eV, 3.06 eV and 3.00 eV respectively (Table 2).Fig. 9 shows photoluminescence spectra of each catalyst to understand the recombination of electron and holes pairs.In general, the photocatalytic activity decreases when the PL intensity increases.The catalysts exhibit a strong PL signal about 440 nm with the exited wavelength of 325 nm.The visible spectral emission at 600-700 nm may be related to singly ionized oxygen vacancies.It results from the radiative recombination of photogenerated holes with electrons occupying the oxygen vacancy 34.The PL emission spectrum of Ni-TiO 2 is decreased when compared to that of TiO 2 .This is attributed to nickel atoms capture the excited electrons and reduce the electron-hole recombination process 35.The PL intensity of Ni-TiO 2 (0.1 mol) is the smallest when compared to other catalysts.However, the PL intensity is increased at higher nickel content.It indicates that high content of Ni do not act as a trapping site to capture the photogenerated electron from TiO 2 conduction band 36.Fig. 10 shows the CO 2 -TPD profile of TiO 2 and Ni-TiO 2 samples.In general, basicity of catalysts is confirmed from CO 2 -TPD.There is only one peak for pure TiO 2 at 573 K 37, but two peaks are observed at about 523 K (small) and 573 (highest) for Ni-TiO 2 .That peak intensity of Ni-TiO 2 is stronger and shifted to high temperature than that of TiO 2 .Therefore addition of nickel increases the interaction between catalysts surface and CO 2 . Methane yield was used to evaluate the performance of the catalysts.Fig. 11 summarizes the methane yield over TiO 2 and Ni-TiO 2 photocatalysts in circulated liquid photoreactor system.The methane was just produced when light on and the highest amount was produced at the first time.After 60 min irradiation, the observed methane yields of catalysts order was: Ni-TiO 2 (0.1 mol) Ni-TiO 2 (0.5 mol) TiO 2 Ni-TiO 2 (1.0 mol).The best catalyst was Ni-TiO 2 (0.1 mol) with a maximum methane yield about 14 lmol/g catal during 60 min.However, the yield of methane was gradually decreased in repeated reaction time.This decrease suggests the gradual deactivation of catalysts, and a phenomenon was reported in the literature 38.One of possible reasons is the saturation of the adsorption site which can be activated on the catalysts surface by the intermediate products 39."}, {"llm generation": "Liquid", "source": "Fig. 2.

Fig. 4 shows HR-TEM images of TiO 2 and Ni-TiO 2 (0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 mol).It is seen that the prepared nanoparticles composed of rhombic shape with size ranging from 10 nm to 20 nm.TEM results do not illustrate any obvious difference in the morphological features between Ni-TiO 2 and pure TiO 2 .The nickel (Ni) content in TiO 2 was checked by EDS.It was not detected in Ni-TiO 2 (0.1 mol) and Ni-TiO 2 (0.5 mol), because of its very low concentration.The detection limit of EDS is also the main factor.However, the Ni content was successfully examined in (1.0 mol).Table 1 shows the atomic composition of elements in Ni-TiO 2 (1.0 mol). The distribution of elements in Ni-TiO 2 (1.0 mol) was confirmed using HR-TEM elemental mapping analysis and the results are shown in Fig. 5.It can be clearly seen that Ti, O, and Ni elements are truly existed in Ni-TiO 2 (1.0 mol). The N 2 adsorption and desorption isotherms and BET surface area of TiO 2 and Ni-TiO 2 are shown in Fig. 6 and Table 2 respectively.The isotherms of the catalysts are similar to type III curves, hence the prepared catalysts are non porous materials 30.The BET surface area of Ni-TiO 2 (0.1 mol) is higher than that of other catalysts. The BET surface area of TiO 2 is increased with increasing of Ni content.On the other hand, the BET surface area of TiO 2 is decreased at high Ni content.This is ascribed to the following reason: The size of Ni ions is smaller than that of Ti ions.However, when large amount of Ni component is added, the pores of TiO 2 are blocked 31.It is important to study the mobility of nanoparticles in water because the reaction was carried out in liquid phase.Fig. 6 shows the influence of pH on the positions of zeta potential distribution of catalysts.The zeta potentials of TiO 2 and Ni-TiO 2 suspensions decreased considerably when increasing pH.The surface charges of materials surface is changed from positive in acid solution to negative in base solution.The isoelectric point of Ni-TiO 2 and TiO 2 was respectively at pH 3.8 and 3.9 which aggregation was considerable.The zeta potential value of Ni-TiO 2 was about A30 mV at pH 7.
