Low-angle X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected in -2 mode using a Rigaku D/MAX-2550VB/PC diffractometer (CuK 1 radiation, 1.5406A), operated at 40 kV and 200 mA (scanning step: 0.02per second).Wide-angle XRD patterns were collected in the same mode, but operated at 100 mA.The nitrogen sorption isotherms were measured at -196 C on a Micromeritics ASAP 2000 apparatus.Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images were taken using a JEOL JEM-2010 electron microscope with an acceleration voltage of 200 kV.Thermogravimetric (TG) analysis was carried out using a Mettler Toledo TGA-SDTA851 analyzer (Switzerland) from 25 to 800 C in an air flow of 80 mL min -1 at a heating rate of 5 C min -1 .X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out on a RBO upgraded PHI-5000C ESCA system (Perkin Elmer) using monochromated Al K X-rays (h 1486.6eV) as the radiation source at 250 W. All binding energies were calibrated using the contaminant carbon (C 1S 284.6 eV) as a reference. The photocatalytic reaction was carried out in a stainless steel reactor with a volume of 1500 mL (as shown in Fig. S2,ESI ).The catalyst powder (0.10 g) was dispersed on the stainless steel omentum, which was fixed in the center of the reactor.The bottom of the glass wool support was moisturized with 5.0 g of deionized water to maintain a saturated water vapor in the reactor.A Xe arc lamp (300 W) with a sun-like radiation spectrum was put at the top of the quartz window at a distance of 8 cm, which irradiated all of the catalyst powder.In order to control the reaction temperature, the Xe lamp was placed in a cold trap and the whole reactor system was surrounded by air circulation.Prior to illumination, the reactor was first purged with the CO 2 H 2 O mixture at 100 mL min -1 for 2 h and then reduced to 20 mL min -1 for another 1 h to establish an adsorption-desorption balance.After that, the reactor was tightly closed and the Xe lamp was then switched on to start the experiment.The reaction temperature and pressure were maintained at 30 C and 110 KPa, respectively.The gas phase products were taken at various times during the irradiation and analyzed by gas chromatography (GC)."}, {"llm generation": "TiO2 catalyst", "source": "Kim et al. reported that an increase in the Ti valence state usually induced a higher photocatalytic activity for the TiO 2 catalyst.", "context": "The low-angle XRD pattern of the synthesized TiO 2 /GC composite is shown in Fig. 1(a) and exhibits a broad diffraction peak in the range of 2 1.0-2.4,which is an indication of a disordered mesoporous structure.For the wide-angle XRD ), it can be seen that there are two weak peaks at around 23 and 44, which can be respectively indexed to the (002) and (101) reflections for a typical graphitic carbon. 25All other diffraction peaks can be indexed to anatase TiO 2 (JCPDS no.21-1272) and no evidence of rutile TiO 2 was detected, suggesting that the coexistence of silica and graphitic carbon in the synthesis stabilized the TiO 2 anatase phase even at elevated temperatures up to 900 C.The crystallite size, estimated from the line broadening of the anatase TiO 2 (101) reflection plane (2 25.3), is about 6 nm.Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis showed that the molar ratio of the residual Si in the TiO 2 /GC composite was very low (1.4), indicating that most of the silica matrix was removed by the alkali solution.The TG results (Fig. S3, ESI ) under an air atmosphere showed that the TiO 2 /GC composite had a chemical composition of about 71 wt anatase TiO 2 and 29 wt graphitic carbon.Fig. 2 shows the nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm and the corresponding pore size distribution curve for the TiO 2 /GC composite.The isotherm exhibits a strong uptake of N 2 as a result of capillary condensation over a wide relative pressure (P/P 0 ) range of 0.4-0.9, which indicates the existence of multiform pore distributions.The pore size distribution obtained from an analysis of the desorption branch of the isotherm is shown in the inset of Fig. 2. It can be seen that the TiO 2 /GC composite had a bimodal pore size distribution with the peaks centered at about 3.8 and 9.3 nm, which are respectively ascribed to the decomposition of the citric acid template and the dissolution of the silica matrix.Such a hierarchical mesostructure is especially valuable for heterogeneous catalytic systems since the reactive molecular diffusion/transfer becomes easy.Additionally, the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of the TiO 2 /GC composite was up to 263.1 m 2 g -1 .This high surface area typically results in a high adsorption capacity, which can provide a high concentration of reaction environments for heterogeneous catalytic reactions. The detailed structure of the TiO 2 /GC composite was provided by TEM images.The low-magnification TEM image given in Fig. 3(a) revealed that hierarchical worm-like mesoporous channels in large domains were present.However, no big particles related to metal oxides were detected from the low-magnification TEM images, indicating that ultrafine nanocrystals of anatase TiO 2 were homodispersed in the mesostructured graphitic carbon.Furthermore, the highmagnification TEM (HRTEM) image (Fig. 3(b)) confirmed that the TiO 2 nanocrystals were well embedded into the graphitic carbon with particle sizes of 5-7 nm, which is consistent with the above deduction.In addition, the HRTEM image shows that the carbon support had a relatively high graphitic degree, with a d spacing of 0.345 nm for the observed lattice planes.This is very close to the d( 002) value (0.34 nm) of typical graphite, and is in agreement with our previous study. 25Furthermore, the presence of the monocrystalline-like anatase phase was also confirmed by the electron diffraction pattern taken from the region with the lattice fringes (Fig. 3(b) inset). The surface chemical states of Ti and O in the TiO 2 /GC composite were investigated by XPS analysis (Fig. 4).For comparison, a mesostructured anatase TiO 2 (meso-TiO 2 ) sample, prepared by a surfactant assisted sol-gel method, 26 was also measured and is plotted in Fig. 4. From Fig. 4(a), it can be seen that the binding energies of Ti 2p 1/2 and Ti 2p 3/2 for the meso-TiO 2 are 464.2 and 458.3 eV, respectively, which are identical to the typical values for TiO 2 .However, for the TiO 2 /GC composite, the Ti 2p 3/2 peak shifts to a higher binding energy (459.2eV).This chemical shift reveals the partial varying of the titanium valence.In general, an increase in the binding energy corresponds to an increase in the oxidation state of the metal, 27 so it is reasonable to believe that the partial titanium oxidation state in the TiO 2 /GC composite (maybe Ti 5 ) was higher than the Ti 4 state in pure TiO 2 .Kim et al. reported that an increase in the Ti valence state usually induced a higher photocatalytic activity for the TiO 2 catalyst. 28The O 1s XPS spectra of the meso-TiO 2 and the TiO 2 /GC composite are displayed in Fig. 4(b).Both samples present two strong features at about 530 and 532 eV, indicating that at least two kinds of oxygen species are present at the surface, which could be recognized by resolving the XPS curves.The lower binding energy peak contributes to lattice oxygen in TiO 2 , while the signal at the higher binding energy can be associated with surface hydroxyl groups. 29,30Based on the area integrals of the two peaks corresponding to lattice oxygen (OL) and surface hydroxyl groups (OS) of the O 1s photoemissions, the ratio of OS to OT (OT OL OS) for both samples was estimated.It was noticed that the value of OS/OT for the TiO 2 /GC composite (74.9) was much higher than that for meso-TiO 2 (51.6).As proposed by Jeong et al., 31 a high surface concentration of hydroxyl groups indicates a high hydrophilicity and thus produces many OH radicals in the holes of the valence band.This suggests that the Ti-OH bonding strength was weaker in the TiO 2 /GC composite than in pure TiO 2 , according to the hard soft acid base (HSAB) rule, resulting in an easier electron flow on the external surface of TiO 2 . As suggested by Usubharatana et al., the enhancement of photocatalytic activity for the reduction of CO 2 is primarily based on a high efficiency of the semiconductor photocatalyst. 32Here the hierarchically mesostructured TiO 2 /GC composite was used as a photocatalyst to convert CO 2 and H 2 O into CH 4 and CO under simulated solar irradiation.The photocatalytic performances of the meso-TiO 2 , TiO 2 /SiO 2 composite and commercial Degussa P25 titania were also carried out under the same experimental conditions for comparison.Additionally, in order to investigate whether other possible carbon sources in the TiO 2 /GC composite produced CO or CH 4 during the photocatalytic process, a control experiment using Ar instead of CO 2 was carried out under the same experimental conditions.The results from the GC analysis show that no CO or CH 4 appear in the absence of CO 2 after an irradiation time of 320 min, suggesting that the origin of carbon in CO and CH 4 is ascribed to the photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O on the TiO 2 /GC composite.Fig. 5 shows the time profiles for the yields of products under irradiation with simulated solar.It can be observed that the yields of CH 4 and CO increased with the irradiation time for all samples.The meso-TiO 2 exhibited a higher photocatalytic activity compared to commercial P25, which may be ascribed to its high specific surface area and mesostructure.Meanwhile the activity of the TiO 2 /SiO 2 composite was very close to that of the meso-TiO 2 , but both were lower than that of the TiO 2 /GC composite.It can be seen that the CH 4 and CO yields for the TiO 2 /GC composite are up to 8.2 and 53.6 mol g -1 cat., respectively, after an irradiation time of 320 min.Such a pronounced photocatalytic performance can be ascribed to the unique structure of the TiO 2 /GC composite, which results in a variety of favorable properties.Firstly, the worm-like mesoporous architecture with a large surface area and a hierarchical pore system allows the reactants to easily diffuse into the bulk of the catalyst and hence provides a fast intraparticle molecular transfer.Meanwhile, the high surface area can enhance the light harvesting and the adsorption of the reactant molecules.Secondly, the photo-induced electrons in the TiO 2 can drift to the graphitic carbon under the inner electric field between TiO 2 and graphitic carbon due to the high electronic conductivity of graphitic carbon.This is helpful for the separation of the photogenerated electronhole pairs in TiO 2 , which results in an improved photocatalytic activity under solar irradiation (as shown in Fig. 6).Finally, XPS analysis confirmed that a high surface concentration of hydroxyl groups existed on the surface of the TiO 2 /GC composite, which led to an easier electron flow on the external surface of the TiO 2 /GC composite and thus suppressed the recombination rate of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs."}, {"llm generation": "hierarchically mesostructured TiO2/GC composite", "source": "Here the hierarchically mesostructured TiO 2 /GC composite was used as a photocatalyst to convert CO 2 and H 2 O into CH 4 and CO under simulated solar irradiation.", "context": "The low-angle XRD pattern of the synthesized TiO 2 /GC composite is shown in Fig. 1(a) and exhibits a broad diffraction peak in the range of 2 1.0-2.4,which is an indication of a disordered mesoporous structure.For the wide-angle XRD ), it can be seen that there are two weak peaks at around 23 and 44, which can be respectively indexed to the (002) and (101) reflections for a typical graphitic carbon. 25All other diffraction peaks can be indexed to anatase TiO 2 (JCPDS no.21-1272) and no evidence of rutile TiO 2 was detected, suggesting that the coexistence of silica and graphitic carbon in the synthesis stabilized the TiO 2 anatase phase even at elevated temperatures up to 900 C.The crystallite size, estimated from the line broadening of the anatase TiO 2 (101) reflection plane (2 25.3), is about 6 nm.Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis showed that the molar ratio of the residual Si in the TiO 2 /GC composite was very low (1.4), indicating that most of the silica matrix was removed by the alkali solution.The TG results (Fig. S3, ESI ) under an air atmosphere showed that the TiO 2 /GC composite had a chemical composition of about 71 wt anatase TiO 2 and 29 wt graphitic carbon.Fig. 2 shows the nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm and the corresponding pore size distribution curve for the TiO 2 /GC composite.The isotherm exhibits a strong uptake of N 2 as a result of capillary condensation over a wide relative pressure (P/P 0 ) range of 0.4-0.9, which indicates the existence of multiform pore distributions.The pore size distribution obtained from an analysis of the desorption branch of the isotherm is shown in the inset of Fig. 2.

As suggested by Usubharatana et al., the enhancement of photocatalytic activity for the reduction of CO 2 is primarily based on a high efficiency of the semiconductor photocatalyst. 32Here the hierarchically mesostructured TiO 2 /GC composite was used as a photocatalyst to convert CO 2 and H 2 O into CH 4 and CO under simulated solar irradiation.The photocatalytic performances of the meso-TiO 2 , TiO 2 /SiO 2 composite and commercial Degussa P25 titania were also carried out under the same experimental conditions for comparison.Additionally, in order to investigate whether other possible carbon sources in the TiO 2 /GC composite produced CO or CH 4 during the photocatalytic process, a control experiment using Ar instead of CO 2 was carried out under the same experimental conditions.The results from the GC analysis show that no CO or CH 4 appear in the absence of CO 2 after an irradiation time of 320 min, suggesting that the origin of carbon in CO and CH 4 is ascribed to the photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O on the TiO 2 /GC composite.Fig. 5 shows the time profiles for the yields of products under irradiation with simulated solar.It can be observed that the yields of CH 4 and CO increased with the irradiation time for all samples.The meso-TiO 2 exhibited a higher photocatalytic activity compared to commercial P25, which may be ascribed to its high specific surface area and mesostructure.Meanwhile the activity of the TiO 2 /SiO 2 composite was very close to that of the meso-TiO 2 , but both were lower than that of the TiO 2 /GC composite.It can be seen that the CH 4 and CO yields for the TiO 2 /GC composite are up to 8.2 and 53.6 mol g -1 cat., respectively, after an irradiation time of 320 min.Such a pronounced photocatalytic performance can be ascribed to the unique structure of the TiO 2 /GC composite, which results in a variety of favorable properties.Firstly, the worm-like mesoporous architecture with a large surface area and a hierarchical pore system allows the reactants to easily diffuse into the bulk of the catalyst and hence provides a fast intraparticle molecular transfer.Meanwhile, the high surface area can enhance the light harvesting and the adsorption of the reactant molecules.Secondly, the photo-induced electrons in the TiO 2 can drift to the graphitic carbon under the inner electric field between TiO 2 and graphitic carbon due to the high electronic conductivity of graphitic carbon.This is helpful for the separation of the photogenerated electronhole pairs in TiO 2 , which results in an improved photocatalytic activity under solar irradiation (as shown in Fig. 6).Finally, XPS analysis confirmed that a high surface concentration of hydroxyl groups existed on the surface of the TiO 2 /GC composite, which led to an easier electron flow on the external surface of the TiO 2 /GC composite and thus suppressed the recombination rate of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs."}, {"llm generation": "TiO2/SiO2 composite", "source": "The photocatalytic performances of the meso-TiO 2 , TiO 2 /SiO 2 composite and commercial Degussa P25 titania were also carried out under the same experimental conditions for comparison.", "context": "The low-angle XRD pattern of the synthesized TiO 2 /GC composite is shown in Fig. 1(a) and exhibits a broad diffraction peak in the range of 2 1.0-2.4,which is an indication of a disordered mesoporous structure.For the wide-angle XRD ), it can be seen that there are two weak peaks at around 23 and 44, which can be respectively indexed to the (002) and (101) reflections for a typical graphitic carbon. 25All other diffraction peaks can be indexed to anatase TiO 2 (JCPDS no.21-1272) and no evidence of rutile TiO 2 was detected, suggesting that the coexistence of silica and graphitic carbon in the synthesis stabilized the TiO 2 anatase phase even at elevated temperatures up to 900 C.The crystallite size, estimated from the line broadening of the anatase TiO 2 (101) reflection plane (2 25.3), is about 6 nm.Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis showed that the molar ratio of the residual Si in the TiO 2 /GC composite was very low (1.4), indicating that most of the silica matrix was removed by the alkali solution.The TG results (Fig. S3, ESI ) under an air atmosphere showed that the TiO 2 /GC composite had a chemical composition of about 71 wt anatase TiO 2 and 29 wt graphitic carbon.Fig. 2 shows the nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm and the corresponding pore size distribution curve for the TiO 2 /GC composite.The isotherm exhibits a strong uptake of N 2 as a result of capillary condensation over a wide relative pressure (P/P 0 ) range of 0.4-0.9, which indicates the existence of multiform pore distributions.The pore size distribution obtained from an analysis of the desorption branch of the isotherm is shown in the inset of Fig. 2. It can be seen that the TiO 2 /GC composite had a bimodal pore size distribution with the peaks centered at about 3.8 and 9.3 nm, which are respectively ascribed to the decomposition of the citric acid template and the dissolution of the silica matrix.Such a hierarchical mesostructure is especially valuable for heterogeneous catalytic systems since the reactive molecular diffusion/transfer becomes easy.Additionally, the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of the TiO 2 /GC composite was up to 263.1 m 2 g -1 .This high surface area typically results in a high adsorption capacity, which can provide a high concentration of reaction environments for heterogeneous catalytic reactions. The detailed structure of the TiO 2 /GC composite was provided by TEM images.The low-magnification TEM image given in Fig. 3(a) revealed that hierarchical worm-like mesoporous channels in large domains were present.However, no big particles related to metal oxides were detected from the low-magnification TEM images, indicating that ultrafine nanocrystals of anatase TiO 2 were homodispersed in the mesostructured graphitic carbon.Furthermore, the highmagnification TEM (HRTEM) image (Fig. 3(b)) confirmed that the TiO 2 nanocrystals were well embedded into the graphitic carbon with particle sizes of 5-7 nm, which is consistent with the above deduction.In addition, the HRTEM image shows that the carbon support had a relatively high graphitic degree, with a d spacing of 0.345 nm for the observed lattice planes.This is very close to the d( 002) value (0.34 nm) of typical graphite, and is in agreement with our previous study. 25Furthermore, the presence of the monocrystalline-like anatase phase was also confirmed by the electron diffraction pattern taken from the region with the lattice fringes (Fig. 3(b) inset).

Low-angle X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected in -2 mode using a Rigaku D/MAX-2550VB/PC diffractometer (CuK 1 radiation, 1.5406A), operated at 40 kV and 200 mA (scanning step: 0.02per second).Wide-angle XRD patterns were collected in the same mode, but operated at 100 mA.The nitrogen sorption isotherms were measured at -196 C on a Micromeritics ASAP 2000 apparatus.Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images were taken using a JEOL JEM-2010 electron microscope with an acceleration voltage of 200 kV.Thermogravimetric (TG) analysis was carried out using a Mettler Toledo TGA-SDTA851 analyzer (Switzerland) from 25 to 800 C in an air flow of 80 mL min -1 at a heating rate of 5 C min -1 .X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out on a RBO upgraded PHI-5000C ESCA system (Perkin Elmer) using monochromated Al K X-rays (h 1486.6eV) as the radiation source at 250 W. All binding energies were calibrated using the contaminant carbon (C 1S 284.6 eV) as a reference. The photocatalytic reaction was carried out in a stainless steel reactor with a volume of 1500 mL (as shown in Fig. S2,ESI ).The catalyst powder (0.10 g) was dispersed on the stainless steel omentum, which was fixed in the center of the reactor.The bottom of the glass wool support was moisturized with 5.0 g of deionized water to maintain a saturated water vapor in the reactor.A Xe arc lamp (300 W) with a sun-like radiation spectrum was put at the top of the quartz window at a distance of 8 cm, which irradiated all of the catalyst powder.In order to control the reaction temperature, the Xe lamp was placed in a cold trap and the whole reactor system was surrounded by air circulation.Prior to illumination, the reactor was first purged with the CO 2 H 2 O mixture at 100 mL min -1 for 2 h and then reduced to 20 mL min -1 for another 1 h to establish an adsorption-desorption balance.After that, the reactor was tightly closed and the Xe lamp was then switched on to start the experiment.The reaction temperature and pressure were maintained at 30 C and 110 KPa, respectively.The gas phase products were taken at various times during the irradiation and analyzed by gas chromatography (GC)."}, {"llm generation": "Solar Simulator", "source": "Here the hierarchically mesostructured TiO 2 /GC composite was used as a photocatalyst to convert CO 2 and H 2 O into CH 4 and CO under simulated solar irradiation.", "context": "The low-angle XRD pattern of the synthesized TiO 2 /GC composite is shown in Fig. 1(a) and exhibits a broad diffraction peak in the range of 2 1.0-2.4,which is an indication of a disordered mesoporous structure.For the wide-angle XRD ), it can be seen that there are two weak peaks at around 23 and 44, which can be respectively indexed to the (002) and (101) reflections for a typical graphitic carbon. 25All other diffraction peaks can be indexed to anatase TiO 2 (JCPDS no.21-1272) and no evidence of rutile TiO 2 was detected, suggesting that the coexistence of silica and graphitic carbon in the synthesis stabilized the TiO 2 anatase phase even at elevated temperatures up to 900 C.The crystallite size, estimated from the line broadening of the anatase TiO 2 (101) reflection plane (2 25.3), is about 6 nm.Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis showed that the molar ratio of the residual Si in the TiO 2 /GC composite was very low (1.4), indicating that most of the silica matrix was removed by the alkali solution.The TG results (Fig. S3, ESI ) under an air atmosphere showed that the TiO 2 /GC composite had a chemical composition of about 71 wt anatase TiO 2 and 29 wt graphitic carbon.Fig. 2 shows the nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm and the corresponding pore size distribution curve for the TiO 2 /GC composite.The isotherm exhibits a strong uptake of N 2 as a result of capillary condensation over a wide relative pressure (P/P 0 ) range of 0.4-0.9, which indicates the existence of multiform pore distributions.The pore size distribution obtained from an analysis of the desorption branch of the isotherm is shown in the inset of Fig. 2. It can be seen that the TiO 2 /GC composite had a bimodal pore size distribution with the peaks centered at about 3.8 and 9.3 nm, which are respectively ascribed to the decomposition of the citric acid template and the dissolution of the silica matrix.Such a hierarchical mesostructure is especially valuable for heterogeneous catalytic systems since the reactive molecular diffusion/transfer becomes easy.Additionally, the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of the TiO 2 /GC composite was up to 263.1 m 2 g -1 .This high surface area typically results in a high adsorption capacity, which can provide a high concentration of reaction environments for heterogeneous catalytic reactions. The detailed structure of the TiO 2 /GC composite was provided by TEM images.The low-magnification TEM image given in Fig. 3(a) revealed that hierarchical worm-like mesoporous channels in large domains were present.However, no big particles related to metal oxides were detected from the low-magnification TEM images, indicating that ultrafine nanocrystals of anatase TiO 2 were homodispersed in the mesostructured graphitic carbon.Furthermore, the highmagnification TEM (HRTEM) image (Fig. 3(b)) confirmed that the TiO 2 nanocrystals were well embedded into the graphitic carbon with particle sizes of 5-7 nm, which is consistent with the above deduction.In addition, the HRTEM image shows that the carbon support had a relatively high graphitic degree, with a d spacing of 0.345 nm for the observed lattice planes.This is very close to the d( 002) value (0.34 nm) of typical graphite, and is in agreement with our previous study. 25Furthermore, the presence of the monocrystalline-like anatase phase was also confirmed by the electron diffraction pattern taken from the region with the lattice fringes (Fig. 3(b) inset). The surface chemical states of Ti and O in the TiO 2 /GC composite were investigated by XPS analysis (Fig. 4).For comparison, a mesostructured anatase TiO 2 (meso-TiO 2 ) sample, prepared by a surfactant assisted sol-gel method, 26 was also measured and is plotted in Fig. 4. From Fig. 4(a), it can be seen that the binding energies of Ti 2p 1/2 and Ti 2p 3/2 for the meso-TiO 2 are 464.2 and 458.3 eV, respectively, which are identical to the typical values for TiO 2 .However, for the TiO 2 /GC composite, the Ti 2p 3/2 peak shifts to a higher binding energy (459.2eV).This chemical shift reveals the partial varying of the titanium valence.In general, an increase in the binding energy corresponds to an increase in the oxidation state of the metal, 27 so it is reasonable to believe that the partial titanium oxidation state in the TiO 2 /GC composite (maybe Ti 5 ) was higher than the Ti 4 state in pure TiO 2 .Kim et al. reported that an increase in the Ti valence state usually induced a higher photocatalytic activity for the TiO 2 catalyst. 28The O 1s XPS spectra of the meso-TiO 2 and the TiO 2 /GC composite are displayed in Fig. 4(b).Both samples present two strong features at about 530 and 532 eV, indicating that at least two kinds of oxygen species are present at the surface, which could be recognized by resolving the XPS curves.The lower binding energy peak contributes to lattice oxygen in TiO 2 , while the signal at the higher binding energy can be associated with surface hydroxyl groups. 29,30Based on the area integrals of the two peaks corresponding to lattice oxygen (OL) and surface hydroxyl groups (OS) of the O 1s photoemissions, the ratio of OS to OT (OT OL OS) for both samples was estimated.It was noticed that the value of OS/OT for the TiO 2 /GC composite (74.9) was much higher than that for meso-TiO 2 (51.6).As proposed by Jeong et al., 31 a high surface concentration of hydroxyl groups indicates a high hydrophilicity and thus produces many OH radicals in the holes of the valence band.This suggests that the Ti-OH bonding strength was weaker in the TiO 2 /GC composite than in pure TiO 2 , according to the hard soft acid base (HSAB) rule, resulting in an easier electron flow on the external surface of TiO 2 . As suggested by Usubharatana et al., the enhancement of photocatalytic activity for the reduction of CO 2 is primarily based on a high efficiency of the semiconductor photocatalyst. 32Here the hierarchically mesostructured TiO 2 /GC composite was used as a photocatalyst to convert CO 2 and H 2 O into CH 4 and CO under simulated solar irradiation.The photocatalytic performances of the meso-TiO 2 , TiO 2 /SiO 2 composite and commercial Degussa P25 titania were also carried out under the same experimental conditions for comparison.Additionally, in order to investigate whether other possible carbon sources in the TiO 2 /GC composite produced CO or CH 4 during the photocatalytic process, a control experiment using Ar instead of CO 2 was carried out under the same experimental conditions.The results from the GC analysis show that no CO or CH 4 appear in the absence of CO 2 after an irradiation time of 320 min, suggesting that the origin of carbon in CO and CH 4 is ascribed to the photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O on the TiO 2 /GC composite.Fig. 5 shows the time profiles for the yields of products under irradiation with simulated solar.It can be observed that the yields of CH 4 and CO increased with the irradiation time for all samples.The meso-TiO 2 exhibited a higher photocatalytic activity compared to commercial P25, which may be ascribed to its high specific surface area and mesostructure.Meanwhile the activity of the TiO 2 /SiO 2 composite was very close to that of the meso-TiO 2 , but both were lower than that of the TiO 2 /GC composite.It can be seen that the CH 4 and CO yields for the TiO 2 /GC composite are up to 8.2 and 53.6 mol g -1 cat., respectively, after an irradiation time of 320 min.Such a pronounced photocatalytic performance can be ascribed to the unique structure of the TiO 2 /GC composite, which results in a variety of favorable properties.Firstly, the worm-like mesoporous architecture with a large surface area and a hierarchical pore system allows the reactants to easily diffuse into the bulk of the catalyst and hence provides a fast intraparticle molecular transfer.Meanwhile, the high surface area can enhance the light harvesting and the adsorption of the reactant molecules.Secondly, the photo-induced electrons in the TiO 2 can drift to the graphitic carbon under the inner electric field between TiO 2 and graphitic carbon due to the high electronic conductivity of graphitic carbon.This is helpful for the separation of the photogenerated electronhole pairs in TiO 2 , which results in an improved photocatalytic activity under solar irradiation (as shown in Fig. 6).Finally, XPS analysis confirmed that a high surface concentration of hydroxyl groups existed on the surface of the TiO 2 /GC composite, which led to an easier electron flow on the external surface of the TiO 2 /GC composite and thus suppressed the recombination rate of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs."}, {"llm generation": "Solar Simulator", "source": "Due to its special composition and structure, the TiO 2 /GC composite exhibited an excellent photocatalytic activity in the photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O under simulated solar irradiation.", "context": "In conclusion, we have demonstrated that a hierarchically mesostructured TiO 2 /graphitic carbon composite photocatalyst with a high content of nanocrystalline TiO 2 was synthesized by a simple one-step nanocasting route.XRD, TG analysis, nitrogen sorption, TEM and XPS results all consistently revealed that anatase TiO 2 nanocrystals with diameters of 5-7 nm were highly dispersed in the graphitic carbon matrix, and the obtained TiO 2 /GC composite possessed a hierarchical mesostructure with a high specific surface area and a high surface concentration of hydroxyl groups.Due to its special composition and structure, the TiO 2 /GC composite exhibited an excellent photocatalytic activity in the photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O under simulated solar irradiation.
