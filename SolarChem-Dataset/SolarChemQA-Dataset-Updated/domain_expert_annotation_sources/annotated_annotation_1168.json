The chemical state and configuration of Pt-SA/CTF-1 were further probed by XPS measurement.As shown in Fig. 3a, the Pt 4f spectra of Pt-SA/CTF-1 could be resolved into two peaks, specifically, 4f 5/2 at 75.5 eV and 4f 7/2 at 72.2 eV, respectively.The two peaks located in the regions between Pt 0 and Pt 2 , indicating the partially positively charged ionic Pt (0 2) oxidation state of single-atom Pt in the Pt-SA/CTF-1 65.In the N 1 s spectra for CTF-EG and CTF-H 2 O, the peaks located at ca. 398.8 eV could be attributed to sp 2 -hybridized aromatic nitrogen (pyridinic N) in the triazine ring (Fig. 3b) 62.The existence of pyridinic N can be regarded as potential anchor sites for Pt atoms 66.After introducing Pt species, the N 1 s peaks of Pt-SA/CTF-1 and Pt-NP/CTF-1 upshifted compared with those of CTF-EG and CTF-H 2 O, indicating the atomic interaction between the pyridinic N and the Pt species and the Pt-N coordination bonds were formed 65,67.Meanwhile, it was found that Pt 4f spectra of Pt-NP/CTF-1 possessed higher binding energies (4f 7/ 2 at 72.5 eV and Pt 4f 5/2 at 76.1 eV) compared with Pt-SA/CTF-1.This observation could be ascribed to the presence of higher oxidation state of Pt 2 in PtO nanoparticles within the Pt-NP/CTF-1 catalysts 64,68,69.This phenomenon further confirmed the existence of PtO nanoparticles, which coincided well with the observed results of TEM and HRTEM, and presumably due to the fact that CTF-H 2 O is an instable support for Pt atoms.On above account, CTF-1 decorated with EG was beneficial to stabilize single Pt atoms. To explore the chemical state and local coordination structure of Pt species in Pt-SA/CTF-1 catalyst, X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra were conducted.As can be seen in the Pt L 3 -edge XANES spectra (Fig. 3c), the white line intensities of Pt foil (Pt 0 ), Pt-SA/ CTF-1(Pt ) and PtO 2 (Pt 4 ) were 1.22, 1.62 and 2.28, respectively.Thus, the electronic states of Pt species in Pt-SA/CTF-1 catalyst could be calculated as 1.51, based on the on the linear correlation between XANES peak intensities and electronic states of Pt species.The Fouriertransformed K 3 -weighted extended X-ray absorption fine structure (FT-EXAFS) reveled detailed structural information of Pt species (Fig. 3d).For Pt-SA/CTF-1 catalyst, the main peak at 1.94 A possessed a lower intensity, which demonstrated Pt-N(C) coordination environment.Additionally, no Pt-Pt characteristic peaks were detected, indicating the isolated Pt atoms were dispersed on CTF-1 support.Moreover, as depicted in Fig. 3e and3f, the EXAFS fitting curve in k space and R space for Pt-SA/CTF-1 sample suggested that the first shell coordination number of the central atom Pt is three.The local structural parameters were provided in Table S1.The EXAFS fitting analysis of Pt-SA/CTF-1 catalyst displayed in Fig. 3f indicated that the coordination environment of Pt single atoms anchored by N atom and two C atoms on CTF-1 supports with the Pt-C, Pt-N and Pt-N(C)-C bond length of 1.92, 2.00 and 3.28 A, respectively.As such, the isolated Pt-N-C2 coordination state could be depicted as illustrated as shown in the inset of Fig. 3f.The wavelet transform extended X-ray absorption fine structure (WTEXAFS) further manifested the local coordination environment of Pt-SA/CTF-1 catalyst, as shown in Fig. 3(g-i the CO 2 molecule and hence serves as the active site for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction. As displayed in Fig. S5, the deconvolution of the C 1 s spectrum for CTF-1 resolved two peaks located at 284.6 eV and 287.3 eV, which could be ascribed to sp 2 -hybridized carbon (C-C) and triazinyl carbon (C-N) in the s-triazine rings, respectively 70,71.In comparison with CTF-1, the CTF-EG, Pt-SA/CTF-1, and Pt-NP/CTF-1 exhibited different XPS patterns in terms of C 1 s, with two resolved peaks located at 286.7 eV and 288.1 eV, which could be assigned to the carbon in cyanogroup (CN) and sp 2hybridized carbon in N-containing aromatic ring (N-C N), respectively 71,72. The as-synthesize CTF-1 and CTF-EG displayed similar XRD patterns in the range from 15 to 30 (Fig. S6), illustrating that the crystal structures of CTF-1 maintained after the solvothermal process in ethylene glycol.After introducing Pt species, the intensities of these diffraction peaks were decreased compared to those of CTF-1 and CTF-EG, signifying that the layered structure of CTF-1 was subjected to considerable extent of exfoliation during the photoreduction process 73,74.As for FT-IR analysis, all the as-obtained samples exhibited typical stretching modes of the triazine ring with signals at 1508 cm -1 and 1357 cm -1 (Fig. 4a) 52.Notably, a carbonitrile band (CN) at 2228 cm -1 was observed for the samples except CTF-1.This phenomenon could be explained by the reversible trimerization of CTF-1 in the solvothermal process 75,76.As shown in Fig. 4b, the solid state 13 C NMR spectra of the samples verified the presence of sp 2 carbons originated from the benzene rings (138, 128 ppm) and triazine ring (170 ppm) in all the samples.Closer observation of the NMR spectra for CTF-EG and Pt-SA/CTF-1 could reveal a weak peak at 66 ppm assigned to carbon atoms in EG 77,78, suggesting the interaction of ethylene glycol with CTF-1. UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) showed that Pt-SA/CTF-1 has an apparent absorption in UV and visible light regions (Fig. 5a).Compared to CTF-1 and Pt-NP/CTF-1, Pt-SA/CTF-1 has a blue shift of the absorption edge to about 408 nm, which may be attributed to the quantum size effect of Pt single atoms in the composites 79,80; Furthermore, the optical bandgap energy (E g ) of Pt-SA/CTF-1, Pt-NP/ CTF-1 and CTF-1 were calculated as 3.03, 2.98 and 2.94 eV, respectively, indicating the band gaps of Pt-SA/CTF-1, Pt-NP/CTF-1 and CTF-1 were similar.Therefore, light absorption is unlikely a contributing factor to modify the photocatalytic performance of Pt-SA/CTF-1.The electrochemical Mott-Schottky Plots were conducted to determine the conduction band (CB) potential.The values for CTF-1, Pt-NP/CTF-1, and Pt-SA/CTF-1 were measured as -1.03, -1.15, and -1.24 V versus the normal hydrogen electrode (vs.NHE), respectively (Figs.S7 (a-c)), which are all more negative than the potential for thermodynamic reduction of CO 2 .Combined with the E g values results, the band structure alignments for as-prepared samples were determined and depicted in Fig. S7d.The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) shown in Fig. 5b illustrated that Pt modification significantly reduced the chargetransfer resistance of CTF-1 as implied by much smaller radii for both Pt-SA/CTF-1 and Pt-NP/CTF-1 samples.It was noteworthy that Pt-SA/CTF-1 exhibited a smaller radius compared with Pt-NP/CTF-1, which suggested that a lower resistance for interfacial charge transfer, highlighting the compelling advantages of using single Pt atoms over Pt nanoparticles anchored on CTF-1.The photocurrent of the as-prepared samples was also determined (Fig. 5c).In comparison with pure CTF-1 and Pt-NP/CTF-1, Pt-SA/CTF-1 possessed the most potent photocurrent responses, demonstrating the superior charge carrier separation/ transfer capacity of single Pt atoms implanted CTF-1.A higher photoinduced electron density was anticipated to enhance the performance of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.Besides, the outstanding charge transfer of Pt-SA/CTF-1 was further evaluated by the LSV analysis.As illustrated in Fig. 5d, the photocurrent densities under CO 2 atmosphere were more prominent than those under N 2 atmosphere for all the samples.As expected, the diffusion-limited current for CO 2 reduction on Pt-SA/CTF-1 was significantly larger than those for other control samples.This result indicated that the effective surface area is largest for the Pt-SA/CTF-1.The low interfacial charge transfer resistance (Fig. 5b) and larger photocurrent density (Fig. 5c) can be attributed to the largest effective surface area of the Pt-SA/CTF-1.These results collectively demonstrated that the Pt-SA/CTF-1 had high electron separation and transfer efficiency, which were favorable for boosting photocatalytic activity. The CO 2 adsorption results (Fig. 6) implied more CO 2 uptake by Pt-SA/CTF-1 than Pt-NP/CTF-1 and CTF-1, which played a contributive role in promoting the photocatalytic activity.The enhanced CO 2 uptake ability of Pt-SA/CTF-1 could be ascribed to a combined effect of the CTF-1 porous structure and a Lewis acid-base interaction between absorbed CO 2 molecules and Pt single atoms 81.Meanwhile, the photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction over Pt-SA/CTF-1 was evaluated in a CO 2saturated H 2 O/triethylamine (TEA) mixture solvent using visible light ( 420 nm) as the light source.CH 4 and CO were detected as main CO 2 reduction products by gas chromatography.As shown in Fig. 7a, Pt-SA/ CTF-1 exhibited a superior CH 4 evolution rate compared with other samples.The CH 4 evolution was about 26 and 4 times higher than those of CTF-1 and Pt-NP/CTF-1, respectively.The apparent quantum efficiency for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction of Pt-SA/CTF-1 was calculated as 0.82.Notably, the selectivity of CH 4 evolution from CO 2 reduction for Pt-SA/CTF-1 (76.6) was significantly higher than that for Pt-NP/ CTF-1 (44.0).This could be explained by the fact that the single atom Pt provided more active sites on the Pt-SA/CTF-1, which enables more CO 2 capture and promotes the charge transfer efficiency, thus reducing the reaction barrier to allow the formation of sufficient CH 4 .For comparison, Pt confined into graphitic carbon nitride (Pt/C 3 N 4 -EG) was also prepared and tested under identical reaction conditions.It was found that the photocatalytic activity and selectivity of CO 2 -to-CH 4 over Pt-SA/CTF-1 sample were much higher than that of Pt/C 3 N 4 -EG.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on covalent organic frameworks-based photocatalysts modified by Pt single atoms for photocatalytic CO 2 -CH 4 reduction.These results underlined the excellent CO 2 reduction activity of Pt-SA/CTF-1 photocatalyst for facilitating the CO 2 -to-CH 4 conversion in the developed single-atom photocatalytic system.It is also worth to mention that photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 by the Pt-NP/CTF-1 and Pt-SA/CTF-1 were in paralleled with H 2 production (Fig. S8), which competed with CO 2 reduction.Noted that the CO 2 reduction experiments of this study were conducted under liquid (water) phase condition and the redox potentials for H 2 O/H 2 is close to that of CO 2 reduction, it was not surprising to observe the H 2 evolution by Pt-SA/CTF-1. The control experiments (Fig. 7b) showed that no reduction products were detected when the reaction was carried out without Pt-SA/CTF-1 or light irradiation, demonstrating the photocatalytic nature of Pt-SA/ CTF-1 system.Only trace CH 4 and CO evolved in the reaction system without TEA or H 2 O, implying the TEA as the electron donor and H 2 O as proton source were crucial factors affecting the conversion of CO 2 to CH 4 and CO.It can also be observed that when H 2 O was removed, the photoactivity reaction was significantly suppressed, indicating that H 2 O was the primary proton source.When the reaction was conducted under a high purity N 2 atmosphere, no CH 4 /CO was detected.The 13 C-labelled isotropic experiments were carried out to identify the elemental origin of CH 4 and CO.In Fig. 7c, the 13 CH 4 (m/z 17) was observed as the dominated product when the reaction was performed under 13 CO 2 atmosphere, verifying that the atmospheric CO 2 provided the carbon source for CH 4 evolution.Besides, the D-labelled isotropic experiments results revealed that H 2 O was the primary hydrogen source of the evolved CH 4 .In order to test the stability of Pt-SA/CTF-1, photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction through consecutive five test cycles was carried out.No significant decrease in CH 4 /CO evolution was observed after five cycles under visible light illumination (Fig. 7d), demonstrating the excellent stability of Pt-SA/CTF-1 catalyst in the CO 2 photoreduction system.TEM images of the recovered Pt-SA/CTF-1 after photocatalytic CO 2 reduction showed no particles or clusters were observed, indicating that the Pt anchored in CTF-1 still maintained the status of single atoms without forming aggregation (Fig. S9). The in-situ FTIR spectrum of Pt-SA/CTF-1 was analyzed to understand the effect of CO 2 adsorption and mass transfer during the photoreduction of CO 2 .Before the test, the Pt-SA/CTF-1 catalyst was dried at 180 C under vacuum to eliminate any adsorbed contaminants (curve i).The in-situ FTIR analysis was measured in two steps, which included CO 2 adsorption with the presence of trace water and then subjected to irradiation ( 420 nm), corresponding to curves ii and iii, respectively.As shown in Fig. 8, after exposure to CO 2 and water vapor under dark (curve ii), the primary carbonate species were formed, including monodentate carbonate (m-CO 3 2-, 1300 cm -1 ), bidentate carbonate (b-CO 3 2-, 1337 cm -1 ), bicarbonate (HCO 3 -, 1420 cm -1 ), and the peak at 1620 cm , 1570 cm -1 ) appeared 878889.Based on the above analysis, it could be inferred that the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction over Pt-SA/CTF-1 underwent multi-step processes: (1) adsorption of CO 2 on the surface of the photocatalysts, (2) formation of intermediates products including HCOOH and HCHO, and (3) intermediates further converted into CH 4 and CO.It was also worth mentioning that the CH 4 molecule was not detected during the in-situ FTIR analysis.This could be reasoned by the nonpolar nature of the CH 4 molecule and its low affinity to attach on photocatalyst surface 79. Based on the above discussion, the possible mechanism for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction on Pt-SA/CTF-1 catalyst could be proposed.As displayed in Fig. 9, CO 2 molecules absorbed on Pt-SA/CTF-1.Upon ); then reduced to intermediates such as HCOOH and HCHO; and finally transformed into CH 4 and CO.Meanwhile, the holes were quenched by TEA.Besides, the high affinity of Pt-SA/CTF-1 for CO 2 adsorption also played a vital role in promoting the formation of Pt-CO 2 adduct and consequently boosting the performance of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction."}], "co-catalyst": [], "light source": [{"llm generation": "visible light", "source": "Herein, we report a well-defined positioned synthesis of Pt single atoms in ethylene glycol (EG)-modified covalent triazine framework (Pt-SA/CTF-1) via a photo-deposition method for efficient photoreduction CO 2 to CH 4 under visible light irradiation.", "context": "Achieving maximum atom-utilization efficiency is desirable to facilitate the charge separation and CO 2 activation for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.Herein, we report a well-defined positioned synthesis of Pt single atoms in ethylene glycol (EG)-modified covalent triazine framework (Pt-SA/CTF-1) via a photo-deposition method for efficient photoreduction CO 2 to CH 4 under visible light irradiation.The well-defined coordination structure of Pt-N(C) sites in the Pt-SA/CTF-1 catalyst has been probed by HAADF-STEM and EXAFS.Results show that Pt single atoms confined into CTF-1 not only improved CO 2 adsorption and activation but also accelerated the separation and transfer of photogenerated carriers in CTF-1.Consequently, Pt-SA/CTF-1 exhibited superior photoactivity and stability, which significantly surpass the Pt nanoparticles-based CTF-1, affording CH 4 as the main reduction product.This work showcases an operable avenue to develop single-metal-atom photocatalysts and a mechanistic insight into photoreduction of CO 2 by CTF-based composite."}, {"llm generation": "Monochromatic", "source": "Meanwhile, the photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction over Pt-SA/CTF-1 was evaluated in a CO 2-saturated H 2 O/triethylamine (TEA) mixture solvent using visible light ( 420 nm) as the light source.", "context": "CTF-1 was synthesized by 1,4-dicyanobenzene polymerization 58.The obtained CTF-1 was modified with EG to obtain CTF-EG, and then the single Pt atoms were anchored on CTF-EG to get Pt-SA/CTF-1 powders by a photo-deposition process (Fig. 1).The accurate Pt content of Pt-SA/CTF-1 catalyst was determined to be about 0.032 by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) analysis.The TEM and SEM images of the samples (Fig. 2a andS1) demonstrated that a graphene-like layered structure of CTF-1 was wellmaintained in Pt-SA/CTF-1, and no other impurities of Pt nanoparticles or agglomerates were observed on the surface of CTF-1 (Fig. 2a).HAADF-STEM was used to probe the distribution of Pt atoms on Pt-SA/ CTF-1.As illustrated in Fig. 2b, some bright spots, which were indicative of Pt elements and marked with red circles, were separately dispersed on CTF-1.The average size of these spots is 2 A, demonstrating that the spots were representative of atomic Pt, and the atomically isolated Pt sites were obtained.The corresponding energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping (Fig. 2c) and EDS spectrum (Fig. S2) further confirmed the presence of Pt and it can be observed that Pt atoms were highly dispersed throughout the framework of CTF-1.On the contrary, some nanoparticles (10 nm 50 nm) can be observed on the TEM image of Pt-NP/CTF-1 (Fig. S3a) and the HRTEM image of Pt-NP/CTF-1 shown in Fig. S3b exhibited a clear lattice fringe with d 0.27 nm, which was well-coincided with the (0 0 2) crystallographic plane of PtO 64.This finding illustrated that PtO might be the main platinum species in Pt-NP/CTF-1.TGA analysis revealed considerable thermal stability below 350 C (Fig. S4) for CTF-1 and Pt-SA/CTF-1, which could be attributed to the triazine moiety and high degree of polymerization in the conjugated network structures. The chemical state and configuration of Pt-SA/CTF-1 were further probed by XPS measurement.As shown in Fig. 3a, the Pt 4f spectra of Pt-SA/CTF-1 could be resolved into two peaks, specifically, 4f 5/2 at 75.5 eV and 4f 7/2 at 72.2 eV, respectively.The two peaks located in the regions between Pt 0 and Pt 2 , indicating the partially positively charged ionic Pt (0 2) oxidation state of single-atom Pt in the Pt-SA/CTF-1 65.In the N 1 s spectra for CTF-EG and CTF-H 2 O, the peaks located at ca. 398.8 eV could be attributed to sp 2 -hybridized aromatic nitrogen (pyridinic N) in the triazine ring (Fig. 3b) 62.The existence of pyridinic N can be regarded as potential anchor sites for Pt atoms 66.After introducing Pt species, the N 1 s peaks of Pt-SA/CTF-1 and Pt-NP/CTF-1 upshifted compared with those of CTF-EG and CTF-H 2 O, indicating the atomic interaction between the pyridinic N and the Pt species and the Pt-N coordination bonds were formed 65,67.Meanwhile, it was found that Pt 4f spectra of Pt-NP/CTF-1 possessed higher binding energies (4f 7/ 2 at 72.5 eV and Pt 4f 5/2 at 76.1 eV) compared with Pt-SA/CTF-1.This observation could be ascribed to the presence of higher oxidation state of Pt 2 in PtO nanoparticles within the Pt-NP/CTF-1 catalysts 64,68,69.This phenomenon further confirmed the existence of PtO nanoparticles, which coincided well with the observed results of TEM and HRTEM, and presumably due to the fact that CTF-H 2 O is an instable support for Pt atoms.On above account, CTF-1 decorated with EG was beneficial to stabilize single Pt atoms. To explore the chemical state and local coordination structure of Pt species in Pt-SA/CTF-1 catalyst, X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra were conducted.As can be seen in the Pt L 3 -edge XANES spectra (Fig. 3c), the white line intensities of Pt foil (Pt 0 ), Pt-SA/ CTF-1(Pt ) and PtO 2 (Pt 4 ) were 1.22, 1.62 and 2.28, respectively.Thus, the electronic states of Pt species in Pt-SA/CTF-1 catalyst could be calculated as 1.51, based on the on the linear correlation between XANES peak intensities and electronic states of Pt species.The Fouriertransformed K 3 -weighted extended X-ray absorption fine structure (FT-EXAFS) reveled detailed structural information of Pt species (Fig. 3d).For Pt-SA/CTF-1 catalyst, the main peak at 1.94 A possessed a lower intensity, which demonstrated Pt-N(C) coordination environment.Additionally, no Pt-Pt characteristic peaks were detected, indicating the isolated Pt atoms were dispersed on CTF-1 support.Moreover, as depicted in Fig. 3e and3f, the EXAFS fitting curve in k space and R space for Pt-SA/CTF-1 sample suggested that the first shell coordination number of the central atom Pt is three.The local structural parameters were provided in Table S1.The EXAFS fitting analysis of Pt-SA/CTF-1 catalyst displayed in Fig. 3f indicated that the coordination environment of Pt single atoms anchored by N atom and two C atoms on CTF-1 supports with the Pt-C, Pt-N and Pt-N(C)-C bond length of 1.92, 2.00 and 3.28 A, respectively.As such, the isolated Pt-N-C2 coordination state could be depicted as illustrated as shown in the inset of Fig. 3f.The wavelet transform extended X-ray absorption fine structure (WTEXAFS) further manifested the local coordination environment of Pt-SA/CTF-1 catalyst, as shown in Fig. 3(g-i the CO 2 molecule and hence serves as the active site for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction. As displayed in Fig. S5, the deconvolution of the C 1 s spectrum for CTF-1 resolved two peaks located at 284.6 eV and 287.3 eV, which could be ascribed to sp 2 -hybridized carbon (C-C) and triazinyl carbon (C-N) in the s-triazine rings, respectively 70,71.In comparison with CTF-1, the CTF-EG, Pt-SA/CTF-1, and Pt-NP/CTF-1 exhibited different XPS patterns in terms of C 1 s, with two resolved peaks located at 286.7 eV and 288.1 eV, which could be assigned to the carbon in cyanogroup (CN) and sp 2hybridized carbon in N-containing aromatic ring (N-C N), respectively 71,72. The as-synthesize CTF-1 and CTF-EG displayed similar XRD patterns in the range from 15 to 30 (Fig. S6), illustrating that the crystal structures of CTF-1 maintained after the solvothermal process in ethylene glycol.After introducing Pt species, the intensities of these diffraction peaks were decreased compared to those of CTF-1 and CTF-EG, signifying that the layered structure of CTF-1 was subjected to considerable extent of exfoliation during the photoreduction process 73,74.As for FT-IR analysis, all the as-obtained samples exhibited typical stretching modes of the triazine ring with signals at 1508 cm -1 and 1357 cm -1 (Fig. 4a) 52.Notably, a carbonitrile band (CN) at 2228 cm -1 was observed for the samples except CTF-1.This phenomenon could be explained by the reversible trimerization of CTF-1 in the solvothermal process 75,76.As shown in Fig. 4b, the solid state 13 C NMR spectra of the samples verified the presence of sp 2 carbons originated from the benzene rings (138, 128 ppm) and triazine ring (170 ppm) in all the samples.Closer observation of the NMR spectra for CTF-EG and Pt-SA/CTF-1 could reveal a weak peak at 66 ppm assigned to carbon atoms in EG 77,78, suggesting the interaction of ethylene glycol with CTF-1. UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) showed that Pt-SA/CTF-1 has an apparent absorption in UV and visible light regions (Fig. 5a).Compared to CTF-1 and Pt-NP/CTF-1, Pt-SA/CTF-1 has a blue shift of the absorption edge to about 408 nm, which may be attributed to the quantum size effect of Pt single atoms in the composites 79,80; Furthermore, the optical bandgap energy (E g ) of Pt-SA/CTF-1, Pt-NP/ CTF-1 and CTF-1 were calculated as 3.03, 2.98 and 2.94 eV, respectively, indicating the band gaps of Pt-SA/CTF-1, Pt-NP/CTF-1 and CTF-1 were similar.Therefore, light absorption is unlikely a contributing factor to modify the photocatalytic performance of Pt-SA/CTF-1.The electrochemical Mott-Schottky Plots were conducted to determine the conduction band (CB) potential.The values for CTF-1, Pt-NP/CTF-1, and Pt-SA/CTF-1 were measured as -1.03, -1.15, and -1.24 V versus the normal hydrogen electrode (vs.NHE), respectively (Figs.S7 (a-c)), which are all more negative than the potential for thermodynamic reduction of CO 2 .Combined with the E g values results, the band structure alignments for as-prepared samples were determined and depicted in Fig. S7d.The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) shown in Fig. 5b illustrated that Pt modification significantly reduced the chargetransfer resistance of CTF-1 as implied by much smaller radii for both Pt-SA/CTF-1 and Pt-NP/CTF-1 samples.It was noteworthy that Pt-SA/CTF-1 exhibited a smaller radius compared with Pt-NP/CTF-1, which suggested that a lower resistance for interfacial charge transfer, highlighting the compelling advantages of using single Pt atoms over Pt nanoparticles anchored on CTF-1.The photocurrent of the as-prepared samples was also determined (Fig. 5c).In comparison with pure CTF-1 and Pt-NP/CTF-1, Pt-SA/CTF-1 possessed the most potent photocurrent responses, demonstrating the superior charge carrier separation/ transfer capacity of single Pt atoms implanted CTF-1.A higher photoinduced electron density was anticipated to enhance the performance of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.Besides, the outstanding charge transfer of Pt-SA/CTF-1 was further evaluated by the LSV analysis.As illustrated in Fig. 5d, the photocurrent densities under CO 2 atmosphere were more prominent than those under N 2 atmosphere for all the samples.As expected, the diffusion-limited current for CO 2 reduction on Pt-SA/CTF-1 was significantly larger than those for other control samples.This result indicated that the effective surface area is largest for the Pt-SA/CTF-1.The low interfacial charge transfer resistance (Fig. 5b) and larger photocurrent density (Fig. 5c) can be attributed to the largest effective surface area of the Pt-SA/CTF-1.These results collectively demonstrated that the Pt-SA/CTF-1 had high electron separation and transfer efficiency, which were favorable for boosting photocatalytic activity. The CO 2 adsorption results (Fig. 6) implied more CO 2 uptake by Pt-SA/CTF-1 than Pt-NP/CTF-1 and CTF-1, which played a contributive role in promoting the photocatalytic activity.The enhanced CO 2 uptake ability of Pt-SA/CTF-1 could be ascribed to a combined effect of the CTF-1 porous structure and a Lewis acid-base interaction between absorbed CO 2 molecules and Pt single atoms 81.Meanwhile, the photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction over Pt-SA/CTF-1 was evaluated in a CO 2saturated H 2 O/triethylamine (TEA) mixture solvent using visible light ( 420 nm) as the light source.CH 4 and CO were detected as main CO 2 reduction products by gas chromatography.As shown in Fig. 7a, Pt-SA/ CTF-1 exhibited a superior CH 4 evolution rate compared with other samples.The CH 4 evolution was about 26 and 4 times higher than those of CTF-1 and Pt-NP/CTF-1, respectively.The apparent quantum efficiency for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction of Pt-SA/CTF-1 was calculated as 0.82.Notably, the selectivity of CH 4 evolution from CO 2 reduction for Pt-SA/CTF-1 (76.6) was significantly higher than that for Pt-NP/ CTF-1 (44.0).This could be explained by the fact that the single atom Pt provided more active sites on the Pt-SA/CTF-1, which enables more CO 2 capture and promotes the charge transfer efficiency, thus reducing the reaction barrier to allow the formation of sufficient CH 4 .For comparison, Pt confined into graphitic carbon nitride (Pt/C 3 N 4 -EG) was also prepared and tested under identical reaction conditions.It was found that the photocatalytic activity and selectivity of CO 2 -to-CH 4 over Pt-SA/CTF-1 sample were much higher than that of Pt/C 3 N 4 -EG.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on covalent organic frameworks-based photocatalysts modified by Pt single atoms for photocatalytic CO 2 -CH 4 reduction.These results underlined the excellent CO 2 reduction activity of Pt-SA/CTF-1 photocatalyst for facilitating the CO 2 -to-CH 4 conversion in the developed single-atom photocatalytic system.It is also worth to mention that photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 by the Pt-NP/CTF-1 and Pt-SA/CTF-1 were in paralleled with H 2 production (Fig. S8), which competed with CO 2 reduction.Noted that the CO 2 reduction experiments of this study were conducted under liquid (water) phase condition and the redox potentials for H 2 O/H 2 is close to that of CO 2 reduction, it was not surprising to observe the H 2 evolution by Pt-SA/CTF-1. The control experiments (Fig. 7b) showed that no reduction products were detected when the reaction was carried out without Pt-SA/CTF-1 or light irradiation, demonstrating the photocatalytic nature of Pt-SA/ CTF-1 system.Only trace CH 4 and CO evolved in the reaction system without TEA or H 2 O, implying the TEA as the electron donor and H 2 O as proton source were crucial factors affecting the conversion of CO 2 to CH 4 and CO.It can also be observed that when H 2 O was removed, the photoactivity reaction was significantly suppressed, indicating that H 2 O was the primary proton source.When the reaction was conducted under a high purity N 2 atmosphere, no CH 4 /CO was detected.The 13 C-labelled isotropic experiments were carried out to identify the elemental origin of CH 4 and CO.In Fig. 7c, the 13 CH 4 (m/z 17) was observed as the dominated product when the reaction was performed under 13 CO 2 atmosphere, verifying that the atmospheric CO 2 provided the carbon source for CH 4 evolution.Besides, the D-labelled isotropic experiments results revealed that H 2 O was the primary hydrogen source of the evolved CH 4 .In order to test the stability of Pt-SA/CTF-1, photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction through consecutive five test cycles was carried out.No significant decrease in CH 4 /CO evolution was observed after five cycles under visible light illumination (Fig. 7d), demonstrating the excellent stability of Pt-SA/CTF-1 catalyst in the CO 2 photoreduction system.TEM images of the recovered Pt-SA/CTF-1 after photocatalytic CO 2 reduction showed no particles or clusters were observed, indicating that the Pt anchored in CTF-1 still maintained the status of single atoms without forming aggregation (Fig. S9). The in-situ FTIR spectrum of Pt-SA/CTF-1 was analyzed to understand the effect of CO 2 adsorption and mass transfer during the photoreduction of CO 2 .Before the test, the Pt-SA/CTF-1 catalyst was dried at 180 C under vacuum to eliminate any adsorbed contaminants (curve i).The in-situ FTIR analysis was measured in two steps, which included CO 2 adsorption with the presence of trace water and then subjected to irradiation ( 420 nm), corresponding to curves ii and iii, respectively.As shown in Fig. 8, after exposure to CO 2 and water vapor under dark (curve ii), the primary carbonate species were formed, including monodentate carbonate (m-CO 3 2-, 1300 cm -1 ), bidentate carbonate (b-CO 3 2-, 1337 cm -1 ), bicarbonate (HCO 3 -, 1420 cm -1 ), and the peak at 1620 cm , 1570 cm -1 ) appeared 878889.Based on the above analysis, it could be inferred that the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction over Pt-SA/CTF-1 underwent multi-step processes: (1) adsorption of CO 2 on the surface of the photocatalysts, (2) formation of intermediates products including HCOOH and HCHO, and (3) intermediates further converted into CH 4 and CO.It was also worth mentioning that the CH 4 molecule was not detected during the in-situ FTIR analysis.This could be reasoned by the nonpolar nature of the CH 4 molecule and its low affinity to attach on photocatalyst surface 79. Based on the above discussion, the possible mechanism for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction on Pt-SA/CTF-1 catalyst could be proposed.As displayed in Fig. 9, CO 2 molecules absorbed on Pt-SA/CTF-1.Upon ); then reduced to intermediates such as HCOOH and HCHO; and finally transformed into CH 4 and CO.Meanwhile, the holes were quenched by TEA.Besides, the high affinity of Pt-SA/CTF-1 for CO 2 adsorption also played a vital role in promoting the formation of Pt-CO 2 adduct and consequently boosting the performance of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction."}], "lamp": [{"llm generation": "Xenon", "source": "Unless otherwise stated, a 300 W Xe lamp with a 420 nm cut-off filter was used as the light source.", "context": "Covalent triazine frameworks (CTF-1) were prepared as follows 58.40 mL Trifluoromethane acid was slowly injected into 5.12 g 1,4-dicyanobenzene contained in a flask at 0 C.

The chemical state and configuration of Pt-SA/CTF-1 were further probed by XPS measurement.As shown in Fig. 3a, the Pt 4f spectra of Pt-SA/CTF-1 could be resolved into two peaks, specifically, 4f 5/2 at 75.5 eV and 4f 7/2 at 72.2 eV, respectively.The two peaks located in the regions between Pt 0 and Pt 2 , indicating the partially positively charged ionic Pt (0 2) oxidation state of single-atom Pt in the Pt-SA/CTF-1 65.In the N 1 s spectra for CTF-EG and CTF-H 2 O, the peaks located at ca. 398.8 eV could be attributed to sp 2 -hybridized aromatic nitrogen (pyridinic N) in the triazine ring (Fig. 3b) 62.The existence of pyridinic N can be regarded as potential anchor sites for Pt atoms 66.After introducing Pt species, the N 1 s peaks of Pt-SA/CTF-1 and Pt-NP/CTF-1 upshifted compared with those of CTF-EG and CTF-H 2 O, indicating the atomic interaction between the pyridinic N and the Pt species and the Pt-N coordination bonds were formed 65,67.Meanwhile, it was found that Pt 4f spectra of Pt-NP/CTF-1 possessed higher binding energies (4f 7/ 2 at 72.5 eV and Pt 4f 5/2 at 76.1 eV) compared with Pt-SA/CTF-1.This observation could be ascribed to the presence of higher oxidation state of Pt 2 in PtO nanoparticles within the Pt-NP/CTF-1 catalysts 64,68,69.This phenomenon further confirmed the existence of PtO nanoparticles, which coincided well with the observed results of TEM and HRTEM, and presumably due to the fact that CTF-H 2 O is an instable support for Pt atoms.On above account, CTF-1 decorated with EG was beneficial to stabilize single Pt atoms. To explore the chemical state and local coordination structure of Pt species in Pt-SA/CTF-1 catalyst, X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra were conducted.As can be seen in the Pt L 3 -edge XANES spectra (Fig. 3c), the white line intensities of Pt foil (Pt 0 ), Pt-SA/ CTF-1(Pt ) and PtO 2 (Pt 4 ) were 1.22, 1.62 and 2.28, respectively.Thus, the electronic states of Pt species in Pt-SA/CTF-1 catalyst could be calculated as 1.51, based on the on the linear correlation between XANES peak intensities and electronic states of Pt species.The Fouriertransformed K 3 -weighted extended X-ray absorption fine structure (FT-EXAFS) reveled detailed structural information of Pt species (Fig. 3d).For Pt-SA/CTF-1 catalyst, the main peak at 1.94 A possessed a lower intensity, which demonstrated Pt-N(C) coordination environment.Additionally, no Pt-Pt characteristic peaks were detected, indicating the isolated Pt atoms were dispersed on CTF-1 support.Moreover, as depicted in Fig. 3e and3f, the EXAFS fitting curve in k space and R space for Pt-SA/CTF-1 sample suggested that the first shell coordination number of the central atom Pt is three.The local structural parameters were provided in Table S1.The EXAFS fitting analysis of Pt-SA/CTF-1 catalyst displayed in Fig. 3f indicated that the coordination environment of Pt single atoms anchored by N atom and two C atoms on CTF-1 supports with the Pt-C, Pt-N and Pt-N(C)-C bond length of 1.92, 2.00 and 3.28 A, respectively.As such, the isolated Pt-N-C2 coordination state could be depicted as illustrated as shown in the inset of Fig. 3f.The wavelet transform extended X-ray absorption fine structure (WTEXAFS) further manifested the local coordination environment of Pt-SA/CTF-1 catalyst, as shown in Fig. 3(g-i the CO 2 molecule and hence serves as the active site for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction. As displayed in Fig. S5, the deconvolution of the C 1 s spectrum for CTF-1 resolved two peaks located at 284.6 eV and 287.3 eV, which could be ascribed to sp 2 -hybridized carbon (C-C) and triazinyl carbon (C-N) in the s-triazine rings, respectively 70,71.In comparison with CTF-1, the CTF-EG, Pt-SA/CTF-1, and Pt-NP/CTF-1 exhibited different XPS patterns in terms of C 1 s, with two resolved peaks located at 286.7 eV and 288.1 eV, which could be assigned to the carbon in cyanogroup (CN) and sp 2hybridized carbon in N-containing aromatic ring (N-C N), respectively 71,72. The as-synthesize CTF-1 and CTF-EG displayed similar XRD patterns in the range from 15 to 30 (Fig. S6), illustrating that the crystal structures of CTF-1 maintained after the solvothermal process in ethylene glycol.After introducing Pt species, the intensities of these diffraction peaks were decreased compared to those of CTF-1 and CTF-EG, signifying that the layered structure of CTF-1 was subjected to considerable extent of exfoliation during the photoreduction process 73,74.As for FT-IR analysis, all the as-obtained samples exhibited typical stretching modes of the triazine ring with signals at 1508 cm -1 and 1357 cm -1 (Fig. 4a) 52.Notably, a carbonitrile band (CN) at 2228 cm -1 was observed for the samples except CTF-1.This phenomenon could be explained by the reversible trimerization of CTF-1 in the solvothermal process 75,76.As shown in Fig. 4b, the solid state 13 C NMR spectra of the samples verified the presence of sp 2 carbons originated from the benzene rings (138, 128 ppm) and triazine ring (170 ppm) in all the samples.Closer observation of the NMR spectra for CTF-EG and Pt-SA/CTF-1 could reveal a weak peak at 66 ppm assigned to carbon atoms in EG 77,78, suggesting the interaction of ethylene glycol with CTF-1. UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) showed that Pt-SA/CTF-1 has an apparent absorption in UV and visible light regions (Fig. 5a).Compared to CTF-1 and Pt-NP/CTF-1, Pt-SA/CTF-1 has a blue shift of the absorption edge to about 408 nm, which may be attributed to the quantum size effect of Pt single atoms in the composites 79,80; Furthermore, the optical bandgap energy (E g ) of Pt-SA/CTF-1, Pt-NP/ CTF-1 and CTF-1 were calculated as 3.03, 2.98 and 2.94 eV, respectively, indicating the band gaps of Pt-SA/CTF-1, Pt-NP/CTF-1 and CTF-1 were similar.Therefore, light absorption is unlikely a contributing factor to modify the photocatalytic performance of Pt-SA/CTF-1.The electrochemical Mott-Schottky Plots were conducted to determine the conduction band (CB) potential.The values for CTF-1, Pt-NP/CTF-1, and Pt-SA/CTF-1 were measured as -1.03, -1.15, and -1.24 V versus the normal hydrogen electrode (vs.NHE), respectively (Figs.S7 (a-c)), which are all more negative than the potential for thermodynamic reduction of CO 2 .Combined with the E g values results, the band structure alignments for as-prepared samples were determined and depicted in Fig. S7d.The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) shown in Fig. 5b illustrated that Pt modification significantly reduced the chargetransfer resistance of CTF-1 as implied by much smaller radii for both Pt-SA/CTF-1 and Pt-NP/CTF-1 samples.It was noteworthy that Pt-SA/CTF-1 exhibited a smaller radius compared with Pt-NP/CTF-1, which suggested that a lower resistance for interfacial charge transfer, highlighting the compelling advantages of using single Pt atoms over Pt nanoparticles anchored on CTF-1.The photocurrent of the as-prepared samples was also determined (Fig. 5c).In comparison with pure CTF-1 and Pt-NP/CTF-1, Pt-SA/CTF-1 possessed the most potent photocurrent responses, demonstrating the superior charge carrier separation/ transfer capacity of single Pt atoms implanted CTF-1.A higher photoinduced electron density was anticipated to enhance the performance of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.Besides, the outstanding charge transfer of Pt-SA/CTF-1 was further evaluated by the LSV analysis.As illustrated in Fig. 5d, the photocurrent densities under CO 2 atmosphere were more prominent than those under N 2 atmosphere for all the samples.As expected, the diffusion-limited current for CO 2 reduction on Pt-SA/CTF-1 was significantly larger than those for other control samples.This result indicated that the effective surface area is largest for the Pt-SA/CTF-1.The low interfacial charge transfer resistance (Fig. 5b) and larger photocurrent density (Fig. 5c) can be attributed to the largest effective surface area of the Pt-SA/CTF-1.These results collectively demonstrated that the Pt-SA/CTF-1 had high electron separation and transfer efficiency, which were favorable for boosting photocatalytic activity. The CO 2 adsorption results (Fig. 6) implied more CO 2 uptake by Pt-SA/CTF-1 than Pt-NP/CTF-1 and CTF-1, which played a contributive role in promoting the photocatalytic activity.The enhanced CO 2 uptake ability of Pt-SA/CTF-1 could be ascribed to a combined effect of the CTF-1 porous structure and a Lewis acid-base interaction between absorbed CO 2 molecules and Pt single atoms 81.Meanwhile, the photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction over Pt-SA/CTF-1 was evaluated in a CO 2saturated H 2 O/triethylamine (TEA) mixture solvent using visible light ( 420 nm) as the light source.CH 4 and CO were detected as main CO 2 reduction products by gas chromatography.As shown in Fig. 7a, Pt-SA/ CTF-1 exhibited a superior CH 4 evolution rate compared with other samples.The CH 4 evolution was about 26 and 4 times higher than those of CTF-1 and Pt-NP/CTF-1, respectively.The apparent quantum efficiency for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction of Pt-SA/CTF-1 was calculated as 0.82.Notably, the selectivity of CH 4 evolution from CO 2 reduction for Pt-SA/CTF-1 (76.6) was significantly higher than that for Pt-NP/ CTF-1 (44.0).This could be explained by the fact that the single atom Pt provided more active sites on the Pt-SA/CTF-1, which enables more CO 2 capture and promotes the charge transfer efficiency, thus reducing the reaction barrier to allow the formation of sufficient CH 4 .For comparison, Pt confined into graphitic carbon nitride (Pt/C 3 N 4 -EG) was also prepared and tested under identical reaction conditions.It was found that the photocatalytic activity and selectivity of CO 2 -to-CH 4 over Pt-SA/CTF-1 sample were much higher than that of Pt/C 3 N 4 -EG.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on covalent organic frameworks-based photocatalysts modified by Pt single atoms for photocatalytic CO 2 -CH 4 reduction.These results underlined the excellent CO 2 reduction activity of Pt-SA/CTF-1 photocatalyst for facilitating the CO 2 -to-CH 4 conversion in the developed single-atom photocatalytic system.It is also worth to mention that photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 by the Pt-NP/CTF-1 and Pt-SA/CTF-1 were in paralleled with H 2 production (Fig. S8), which competed with CO 2 reduction.Noted that the CO 2 reduction experiments of this study were conducted under liquid (water) phase condition and the redox potentials for H 2 O/H 2 is close to that of CO 2 reduction, it was not surprising to observe the H 2 evolution by Pt-SA/CTF-1. The control experiments (Fig. 7b) showed that no reduction products were detected when the reaction was carried out without Pt-SA/CTF-1 or light irradiation, demonstrating the photocatalytic nature of Pt-SA/ CTF-1 system.Only trace CH 4 and CO evolved in the reaction system without TEA or H 2 O, implying the TEA as the electron donor and H 2 O as proton source were crucial factors affecting the conversion of CO 2 to CH 4 and CO.It can also be observed that when H 2 O was removed, the photoactivity reaction was significantly suppressed, indicating that H 2 O was the primary proton source.When the reaction was conducted under a high purity N 2 atmosphere, no CH 4 /CO was detected.The 13 C-labelled isotropic experiments were carried out to identify the elemental origin of CH 4 and CO.In Fig. 7c, the 13 CH 4 (m/z 17) was observed as the dominated product when the reaction was performed under 13 CO 2 atmosphere, verifying that the atmospheric CO 2 provided the carbon source for CH 4 evolution.Besides, the D-labelled isotropic experiments results revealed that H 2 O was the primary hydrogen source of the evolved CH 4 .In order to test the stability of Pt-SA/CTF-1, photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction through consecutive five test cycles was carried out.No significant decrease in CH 4 /CO evolution was observed after five cycles under visible light illumination (Fig. 7d), demonstrating the excellent stability of Pt-SA/CTF-1 catalyst in the CO 2 photoreduction system.TEM images of the recovered Pt-SA/CTF-1 after photocatalytic CO 2 reduction showed no particles or clusters were observed, indicating that the Pt anchored in CTF-1 still maintained the status of single atoms without forming aggregation (Fig. S9). The in-situ FTIR spectrum of Pt-SA/CTF-1 was analyzed to understand the effect of CO 2 adsorption and mass transfer during the photoreduction of CO 2 .Before the test, the Pt-SA/CTF-1 catalyst was dried at 180 C under vacuum to eliminate any adsorbed contaminants (curve i).The in-situ FTIR analysis was measured in two steps, which included CO 2 adsorption with the presence of trace water and then subjected to irradiation ( 420 nm), corresponding to curves ii and iii, respectively.As shown in Fig. 8, after exposure to CO 2 and water vapor under dark (curve ii), the primary carbonate species were formed, including monodentate carbonate (m-CO 3 2-, 1300 cm -1 ), bidentate carbonate (b-CO 3 2-, 1337 cm -1 ), bicarbonate (HCO 3 -, 1420 cm -1 ), and the peak at 1620 cm , 1570 cm -1 ) appeared 878889.Based on the above analysis, it could be inferred that the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction over Pt-SA/CTF-1 underwent multi-step processes: (1) adsorption of CO 2 on the surface of the photocatalysts, (2) formation of intermediates products including HCOOH and HCHO, and (3) intermediates further converted into CH 4 and CO.It was also worth mentioning that the CH 4 molecule was not detected during the in-situ FTIR analysis.This could be reasoned by the nonpolar nature of the CH 4 molecule and its low affinity to attach on photocatalyst surface 79. Based on the above discussion, the possible mechanism for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction on Pt-SA/CTF-1 catalyst could be proposed.As displayed in Fig. 9, CO 2 molecules absorbed on Pt-SA/CTF-1.Upon ); then reduced to intermediates such as HCOOH and HCHO; and finally transformed into CH 4 and CO.Meanwhile, the holes were quenched by TEA.Besides, the high affinity of Pt-SA/CTF-1 for CO 2 adsorption also played a vital role in promoting the formation of Pt-CO 2 adduct and consequently boosting the performance of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction."}, {"llm generation": "Liquid", "source": "Fig. 5.

The viscous solution was mixed by stirring at 30 C until solidification and then kept in static condition for 3 days.The solid was washed with dichloromethane (2 80 mL) and NH 3 H 2 O (3 200 mL), and then re-dispersed in NH 3 H 2 O (200 mL).After centrifuging with ultrapure water and methanol, the obtained solid was Soxhlet extracted by methanol and dichloromethane, respectively.Finally, CTF-1 was obtained after vacuum drying for 12 h at 80 C and ground into powders. A homogeneous suspension of CTF-1 (500 mg) in EG (30 mL) was transferred into a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and then heated at 150 C for 4 h, After natural cooling, the solid was separated and washed with copious amount of ultrapure water and ethanol, and vacuum-dried at 60 C overnight to afford CTF-EG as gray solid, The as-prepared CTF-EG (50 mg) was then dispersed in ultrapure water (30 mL) under stirring.25 L H 2 PtCl 6 solution (1 mg/mL) was dropped into the obtained suspended solution.After bubbling of nitrogen gas for 30 min, the obtained suspension was subjected to irradiation by ultraviolet lamps for 30 min, where the EG was consumed as a sacrificial agent to facilitate the removal of Cl -ligands on Pt, thus enabling the stabilization of Pt single atoms by forming Pt-N bonds and anchoring on CTF-1 61.The obtained solid then underwent washing with ultrapure water and ethanol, and thereafter naturally dried. Finally, the single Pt atoms anchored on CTF-1 were obtained and denoted as Pt-SA/CTF-1. The Pt nanoparticles in CTF-1 (Pt-NP/CTF-1) were prepared through a similar synthesis process to that of single Pt atoms in CTF-1, except the ethylene glycol was replaced by distilled water in this process. g-C 3 N 4 was prepared according to previous literature 62.In brief, melamine was calcined at 550 C for 4 h.After natural cooling, the asobtained agglomerates were ground into powders, and the g-C 3 N powders were obtained.The Pt confined into g-C 3 N 4 (Pt/C 3 N 4 -EG) was prepared through the similar protocol for Pt-SA/CTF-1, in which the CTF-1 was replaced by g-C 3 N 4 .

UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-vis DRS) were measured with a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Varian Cary 500) by using the powder samples with BaSO 4 as the reflectance standard.The CO and CH 4 gas produced from 13 CO 2 and Dlabelled isotope experiments were examined by a gas chromatographmass spectrometer (GC-MS, Agilent 7890B-5977B).The equipped column in GC-MS analysis was CP-Molsieve 5A (Agilent Technologies, 25.0 m 0.32 mm 30 m). The photoelectrochemical experiment was conducted by a conventional three-electrodes system, in which a platinum plate electrode was used as the counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode.The working electrode was fabricated as the following process.The well-mixed colloid (10 L) containing sample (10 mg) and N, N-dimethylformamide (1 mL) was dipped onto a fluoride-tin oxide (FTO) glass with a cover area of 0.25 cm 2 .The working electrode was dried at room temperature.The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves were performed with 0.2 M Na 2 SO 4 aqueous solution as the electrolyte in an electrochemical workstation (ZAHNER IM6).The CO 2 or N 2 was bubbled into the electrolyte to keep the CO 2 or N 2 -saturated environment.The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) experiment was tested by ZAHNER IM6 with a 5 mM K 3 Fe (CN) 6 /5 mM K 4 Fe (CN) 6 /0.1 M KCl mixed solution as electrolytes.The photocurrent data was recorded with a CHI650E electrochemical workstation with 0.2 M Na 2 SO 4 solution as electrolyte.
