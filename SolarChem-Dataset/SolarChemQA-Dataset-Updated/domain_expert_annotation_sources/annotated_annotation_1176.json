The valence state and content of Cu, Sn and S exposed on CTS surface intrinsically influenced the photoreduction process from CO 2 to CH 4 , because of sulfur-deficient in Cu 3 SnS 4 induced the imbalance of electron around Cu, Sn and S atoms.Two peaks positioned at 2p 3/2 (932 eV) and 2p 1/2 (954.6 eV) in Cu 2p spectrum (Fig. 2a) revealed the presence of Cu(I) and Cu(II) ions on CTS surface 37,38.Binding energy (BE) of Cu (I) shift from 932.4 eV to 931.9 eV was accompanied with BE of Cu (II) shift from 934.6 eV to 934.1 eV confirmed the decrease of copper atoms valence state 39.S vacancy increased the electron density of Cu(I) 2p orbital, which led to the decrease of their binding energies.The content percentage of Cu(I) ions in prepared CTS was gradually increased (79 , 86 , 90 for CTS-0.5, CTS-1 and CTS-2, respectively).Sn 3d spectrum was observed with two peaks of Sn 3d 5/2 (495.2 eV) and Sn 3d 3/2 (487.3 eV), indicating Sn in both Sn(II) and Sn(IV) oxidation states 29.Peaks of Sn(II) 3d 5/2 (486.5 eV, 486.2 eV and 486.3 eV for CTS-0.5, CTS-1 and CTS-2, respectively), shift to lower binding energy, and then to higher binding energy, which indicated that the valence state of Sn atoms decreased 39.S vacancy increased the electron density of Sn (II) 3d orbital, which led to the decrease of their binding energies.The proportion of Sn(II) ions in prepared CTS was changed from 30 to for CTS-0.5 (30 ), CTS-1 (51 ) and CTS-2 (42 ), respectively.The spin-orbit doublet of S 2p 3/2 (161.7 eV) and S 2p 1/2 (164.6 eV), almost remained at the same position over the three samples (Fig. 2c).This revealed the presence of Cu(I)-S, Cu(II)-S, Sn(II)-S and Sn(IV)-S on the CTS surface. To further clarify the function of introduced S vacancy in the reaction of photoreduction CO 2 to CH 4 , it is crucial to reveal the characteristic of unpaired electrons with low spin level in S 3p orbit which induced the enhancement of its photocatalytic activity.S defect at g 2.003 in room temperature ESR spectrum was determined here (Fig. 2d) act as electron trap center to aggregate photogenerated electrons 31,40, which was ascribed to unpaired electrons in S 3p orbit induced Cu(II) and Sn(IV) transform to Cu(I) and Sn(II), respectively. Photocatalytic reduction properties of CO 2 were carried out under visible light ( 420 nm) irradiation emitted from 300 W Xe lamp without cocatalysts or sacrificial agents added.Detailed descriptions of CO 2 photocatalytic reduction measurement were presented in the Methods.The summary of photocatalytic experiment results could be found in Text S3. Yield of CH 4 (5.64,22.65 and 5.83 mol/g/h) and CO (16.27, 18.42 and12.87mol/g/h) were obtained on the surface of CTS-0.5, CTS-1 and CTS-2, respectively (Fig. 3).It should be noted that the production amount of CO did not increase with the increasing irradiation time after the initial first reaction hour, while the yield of CH 4 increased linearly with the irradiation time increasing during the whole reaction process and finally achieved at 83.10 selectivity with 22.65 mol/g/h CH yield.The cycle experiments were given in Fig. S4.CO production did not increase with the increasing irradiation time proving that CO was an intermediate in the reduction path of CH 4 .No H 2 gas was monitored here due to H 2 O being oxidized on the Sn(IV) site to generated H , which was transferred from Sn(IV) site to Cu(I) site to take part in CO 2 photocatalytic reduction.In order to illustrate this process, O 2 evolution experiment of on the surface of CTS-1was carried out here (Fig. 3f).The production amount of O 2 did not increase quickly after the first reaction hour from 149.05 mol/g/h to 29.75 mol/g/h, due to the reduction of subsequent CO release, which also proved that CO was an intermediate in this CH 4 generation path.The control experiments (Fig. 3) demonstrated that no CO or CH 4 was detected in the absence of either the photocatalyst or light, suggesting that the obtained reduced products were the result of the photocatalytic reaction on the surface of the photocatalyst.The carbon source in CO 2 reduction reaction had always been controversial, so it was very necessary to eliminate the error carbon source.In this work, no product was detected without CO 2 gas injection, which proved that the carbon source involved in CO 2 photocatalytic reduction only came from the CO 2 gas injected by us.The source of hydrogen protons was quite crucial to drive CO 2 photoreduction reaction, in other words, if enough hydrogen protons were not provided, the reduction reaction cannot be carried out successfully.In our work, no product was detected without water injection, indicating that water was a reducing agent, which was also the reason why we can detect the production of oxygen (Fig. 3f).To determine the driving force in photocatalytic reaction process, wave-length-dependent CH 4 and CO evolution performance of CTS-1 was measured to evaluate the apparent quantum yield (AQY) in Fig. S11 and Text S4.The corresponding AQY of CTS-1 at 410, 420, 450, and 490 nm were 1.06 , 0.66 , 0.45 and 0.24 , respectively, which was consistent with the trend of light absorption, suggesting that the CO 2 reduction reaction on CTS-1 was a typical photocatalytic driven process. Fabricated S vacancy had a crucial influence on effective photoactivity sites and adsorption sites, such as the adsorption of CO 2 , the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs and the photoreduction ability of photogenerated electrons, resulting in the enhanced photoreduction of CO 2 to CH 4 (Fig. 3).With the increase of S vacancy concentration, the amount of existing Cu(I) and Sn(II) was also changed accordingly (Fig. 2) resulting in CO 2 being adsorbed smoothly on Cu(I) atom (-0.195 eV binding energy) than Cu(II) atom (-0.185 eV binding energy) (Fig. 6) and the photoreduction ability of photogenerated electrons was strengthened ascribing to the introduced Sn(II) 5p (Fig. 5).Fig. 5 showed the electronic density of states (DOS) of CTS.For pure CTS (Fig. 5a andb), the CBM (conduction band minimum) mainly consisted of Sn(II) 5p states.Fig. 5c showed that for sulfur-deficient CTS, Sn(II) was obviously higher than that of Sn(IV) for the contribution of conduction band, meaning that electrons were enriched around Sn(II) atoms, so the electron recombination rate was reduced.The fluorescence intensity can be used to analyze the electron hole recombination rate due to some electron and hole pairs which recombine and release energy in the form of fluorescence.With the increase of existence of Cu(I) ratio, a significant decrease in PL intensity under PL excitation at 310 nm was detected in CST-1 compared to the other samples (Fig. 4a), indicating the highest number of electrons with the highest separation efficiency to perform the photo reduction of CO 2 .Time-resolved transient PL measurements of the fluorescence lifetime, that is, the time required for the fluorescence intensity to decay to the initial 1/e.The average emission lifetime (Fig. 4b) of CTS-1 (0.53 ns) was longer than that of CTS-0.5 (0.38 ns) and CTS-2 (0.41 ns).Due to the hybrid composite, the separation efficiency of photogenerated charge carriers to perform the photoreduction of CO 2 had slower PL decay with longer average lifetime than CTS-0.5 and CTS-2.The effective charge transfer and separation was demonstrated by the smallest diameter/radius semicircle of Nyquist impedance arc of CST-1 (Fig. 4d).The photocurrent density of CTS-1 was slightly higher than that of CTS-0.5 and CTS-2, revealed the highest separation efficiency of photogenerated charge carriers (Fig. 4c). ESR (Fig. 2d) proved the existence of S vacancy in the material, and CTS-1 had the most S vacancies.The more S vacancies in ESR, the more Cu(I) and Sn(II) in the low state around it, so the more Sn(II) existence in CTS-1, which was consistent with XPS analysis.CB position of Cu 3 SnS 4 was dominated by Sn(II) 5p orbital from Fig. 5c andd, so it can be regulated by controlling the ratios of Sn(II).With the most Sn(II) content percentage, the most negative conduction band position was achieved at CTS-1, revealing the strongest electron reduction ability to drive CO 2 photoreduction reaction (Fig. S5).The estimation of the conduction band potential (CBP) and valence band potential (VBP) is dynamic to understand the potential mechanisms of photocatalytic complexes for photocatalytic reactions using photoinduced charge transfer and separation.The Tauc plot (Text S1) derived from DRS spectrum depicts the optical band gap of 1.67 eV (Fig. S5a).The position of the conduction band and valance band of the prepared catalysts here was determined by extrapolation to the X intercept in the Mott-Schottky plot (Fig. S5b) and VB XPS (Fig. S5c), respectively.The transformation of Sn(IV) to Sn(II) due to S vacancy formation obviously increased the CTS-1conduction band position which was ascribed to the contribution of Sn(II) 5p orbital (-1.05 eV) and S 3p orbital (0.62 eV), which resulted in the driving force of CO 2 to CH 4 strengthening.The increase of S vacancy led to the increase of Sn(II) content, which made the conduction band position more negative and the electron reduction ability stronger.Therefore, the electron reduction ability on Cu(I) was also enhanced, which was conducive to the carbon dioxide reduction reaction. Thermodynamically, the redox potential of CO 2 to CH 4 was -0.24 V vs NHE, less than the -0.53 V vs NHE needed to produce CO, making the reaction more likely to produce CH 4 .Dynamically, CH 4 production is an 8-electron reaction much higher than the 2-electron reaction needed to produce CO.Due to the above stated the S vacancies could result in charge transfer to the surrounding Cu(I) atoms (reactive active sites), the higher density of surface photo-generated electrons meant the higher probability of multiple electron reactions (from CO 2 to CH 4 ) 31,32.The details about the DFT calculation (Text S2) of binding energy of CO 2 , H 2 O, CO and CH 4 could be found in Figs.S6-S9 or Tables S2-S5.From the binding energy of carbon dioxide and water on Cu(I), Cu(II), Sn (II), Sn(IV) adsorption sites, it could be concluded that Cu(I) possessed a stronger adsorption capacity for CO 2 , and Sn(IV) had inherently a stronger adsorption capacity for water (Fig. 6a andb).The redox reaction was separated spatially, and the recombination rate of electron holes was reduced, making the 8-electron reaction more likely to occur.At the same time, H produced on Sn(IV) was transferred to Cu(I), which guaranteed the selectivity of as-prepared S vacancy Cu 3 SnS to methane. In the process of carbon dioxide reduction, the different Gibbs free energy of different intermediate products will affect the selectivity of final products 29,31.Gibbs free energy calculations were carried out on these possible reaction pathways (Fig. 6).According to the calculated results shown in Fig. 6c, it was suggested that the formation of CH 2 O intermediates had a lower CH 2 O formation energy (G:1.270eV) than that of C (G:2.189eV) and HCOH (G:1.891eV).The formation of CH 3 O intermediates (Fig. 6d) had a lower CH 3 O formation energy (G:0.562eV) than that of CH (G:2.209eV) and CH 2 OH (G:1.007eV).We also carried out the complete Gibbs free energy calculations for CH 4 generation.According to the calculated results shown in Fig. 7a, it was suggested that the formation of CHO intermediates was the rate-limiting step for CTS-1.The formation of the CHO radical was an endothermic process, thus part of CO was desorbed to produce CO, and part of CO was used to produce CHO.The Gibbs free energy of CO 2 , CO and COOH were 0.494 eV, 0.596 eV and 1.387 eV, respectively.In addition, as revealed in Fig. 7a Based on the DFT calculation (Text S2) results and in-situ FTIR spectroscopy data, the most likely reduction path of the catalytic system was speculated as follows: To expound the structural stability of prepared photocatalyst during the reduction process, Raman spectra of CTS-1 after reaction were detected, as shown in Fig. 8a, from which, it should be noted that the characteristic peak locations were unchanged after the photoreduction process, proved the good stability of CTS-1.The S vacancy in Cu 3 SnS plays an important role on the activity and selectivity of the CO photoreaction, especially Sn(II) is considered to be stabilized by vacancy defects.There is no obvious change of S vacancy before and after the reaction detected using ESR detection (Fig. 8b).Thus, the stability of S vacancy also indirectly proves the stability of Sn(II) generated by the S vacancy.The peak area of the C-O peak 42 at a position of 1118 cm - decreased after the reaction (Fig. 8c), indicating that the sample had lower adsorption performance for CO, which was the intermediate of the CH 4 production path.This might explain why the CO production increased slightly and the CH 4 production decreased slightly after 15 h of reaction.In the spectrum, the Sn-S bond appeared at 670 cm -1 .The peak area of the CO 2 -peak 41,43 and HCOO -peak 31 at positions of 1204 and 1619 cm -1 .The mode at around 1508 cm -1 is m-CO 3 2-peak. The bands at 1544 cm -1 correspond to bicarbonate species HCO 3 -which arose from absorbed CO 2 and surface hydroxyls from dissociative H 2 O molecules 41.The bands at 1648 and 1695 cm -1 corresponded to bicarbonate species b-CO 3 2-peak 41.The doublet bands centered at 2350 cm -1 indicated the asymmetric stretching of CO 2 molecules 44,45.The peaks did not exhibit significant change before and after the reaction, which proved the stability of CTS-1. The change of the active sites in the materials before and after the reaction can affect the stability of the reaction.Over the surface of the CTS (2 0 0), the interaction of CO 2 and H 2 O molecules (Fig. 6) was studied at the DFT D2 level, Cu(I) and Sn(IV) preferentially absorbed CO 2 and H 2 O, respectively.CO 2 reduction and H 2 O oxidation proceeded separately, inhibiting occurrence of side reactions.After the reaction, the proportion of Sn(IV) decreased (Fig. 8e), the oxidation site of water decreased, reducing the transmission of H , so the CH 4 production rate decreased.The ratio of Cu(I) and Cu(II) before and after photocatalytic reaction over CTS-1 determined by the Cu 2p XPS spectra (Fig. 8d) exhibited a change.Meanwhile, peaks of Cu(I) 2p 3/2 shift to higher BE (from 932 eV to 932.2 eV) as well as the Cu(II) 2p 1/2 peak did (from 934.6 eV to 935 eV), which indicated that the valence state of copper atoms increased 39.It also meant the Cu(I) content decreased (from 79.76-79.40)after 5 h reaction, which could also explain the reactivity dropping slightly after 15 h.The ratio of Sn(II) and Sn(IV) by the Sn 3d XPS spectra exhibited a change (Fig. 8e) which can prove that there was the conversion between Sn(II) and Sn(IV).Peaks of Sn(II) shift to lower BE (3d 5/2 :from 486.2 eV to 486 eV, and 3d 3/2 :from 494.6 eV to 494.3 eV) as well as the Sn(IV) peak did (3d 5/2 :from 487 eV to 486.9 eV, and 3d 3/2 :from 495.6 eV to 495.5 eV), which indicated that the valence state of Sn atoms decreased 39.It also meant the Sn(IV) content decreased (from 49 to 47 ) after 5 h reaction, which explained the reactivity dropping slightly after 15 h.From Fig. 8f, XPS of S 2p spectrum exhibited a change before and after the photocatalytic reaction on CTS-1, which was due to the transformation between Sn(II) and Sn(IV), and the decrease of Sn(IV)-S led to a change on the S peak area.The peak position of S did not exhibit a change significantly, but the proportion of Sn(IV)-S decreased from 41 to 36 , which led to a change of on the S peak area.However, S was not the active site of the reaction, so it had no obvious effect on the stability of the reaction."}, {"llm generation": "S defected Cu 3 SnS 4 nanoparticles", "source": "In summary, we fabricated S defected Cu 3 SnS 4 nanoparticles to realized precisely tailor the selectivity and reactivity of photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 to CH 4, which attributed to the enhancement of electron reduction ability via introduction of both Cu(I) site and Sn(II) site.", "context": "In summary, we fabricated S defected Cu 3 SnS 4 nanoparticles to realized precisely tailor the selectivity and reactivity of photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 to CH 4 , which attributed to the enhancement of electron reduction ability via introduction of both Cu(I) site and Sn(II) site.DFT calculations further proved the more negative CB position of Cu 3 SnS 4 was dominated by Sn(II) 5p orbital possessing the more stronger electron reduction ability.CTS possesses a Cu(I)-Sn(IV) (2 0 0) surface which promoted CO 2 /H 2 O adsorption and activation.Introducing S vacancies results in electron enriching around Sn(II) atoms, which made the conduction band position more negative, and the reduction ability of electrons on Cu(I) were enhanced accordingly, thus the reaction path was CO 2 COOHCOCHOCH 2 OCH 3 O CH 4 .CTS-1 exhibited 22.65 mol/g/h of CH 4 evolution and 83.10 selectivity.This work inspired a method to achieve the desirable CH 4 evolution from CO 2 photocatalytic reduction, meanwhile, more effort is needed in order to rationally design more efficient synergistic durable mental structures between adsorption site and photocatalytic activity site.

The crystal structure of CTS was confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Cu Ka radiation source, D8 Advanced, Bruker, Germany).The morphology of CTS was studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, S-4800, Japan).The high-resolution transmission electron (HRTEM) microscopy was performed with an FEI Tecnai G2 F20 and FEG system at 200 kV.Using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo SCIEN-TIFIC ESCALAB 250XI) to analyze surface electronic states.The diffuse reflectance spectra of the samples were recorded on a UV-vis spectrophotometer (UV-2700, Shimadzu, Japan).The Photoluminescence (PL) properties were investigated by a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Fluorolog-3, HORIBA Scientific, America).The functional groups of the samples were identified using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR, Nicolet 6700, USA).In situ FTIR spectra were acquired using a Thermo Scientific Nicolet 6700, USA.Raman study was performed using LABRAM HR 800 from Jobin Yvon Horiba.Electron spin-resonance resonance (ESR, JES-FA 200, JEOL, Japan, 100 kHz, 1.0 mW) was performed at room temperature. The photoelectrochemical properties were obtained in a threeelectrode system using CHI660E workstation (Chenghua, Shanghai).In the three-electrode system, the as-synthesized samples coated on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) were used as the working electrode, the Pt wire as the counter electrode, and the saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode.Na 2 SO 4 (0.1 M) aqueous solution was used as the electrolyte.To prepare the working electrode, 10 mg of samples were dispersed into 450 L ethanol and 50 L Nafion mixtures stirred by soft ultrasonic to obtain a uniform suspension.The obtained suspension (30 L) was dropped on the pretreated FTO (ca. 1 1 cm 2 ), and heated at 60 C for 5 h in an oven.A 300 W Xenon lamp equipped with a 420 nm cutoff filter was utilized as a light source.Mott-Schottky plots were recorded in the dark with a frequency of 1 kHz.The photocurrent with ON/OFF cycles was measured at an applied potential of 0.2 V versus SCE.And, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was taken in the frequency range of 0.01-200 Hz at the open circuit potential. Gas phase photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was carried out in a closed gas cycle glass reactor, which was strictly vacuumized before the reaction.During the experiment process, 20 mg sample was dispersed in quartz paper, and 3 ml distilled water was added into the glass reactor.The system was vacuumed and 70 kpa of CO 2 pumped in.A 300 W Xe lamp with a 420 nm cutoff filter was used as light source.Take 0.5 mL productions for testing once an hour.The produced CH 4 CO was analyzed by an online gas chromatograph (GC-2014C, Shimadzu).The produced H 2 was analyzed by an online gas chromatograph (GC-2014C, Shimadzu) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector.The selectivity of formed productions was deduced according to the following equation: in which N CH4 and N CO stand for the yield of reactively formed CH 4 and CO respectively."}, {"llm generation": "Visible light (420 nm)", "source": "Photocatalytic reduction properties of CO 2 were carried out under visible light ( 420 nm) irradiation emitted from 300 W Xe lamp without cocatalysts or sacrificial agents added.", "context": "The crystallinity exposed crystal face and the surface area are important for the selectivity and activity of CRR reaction.The XRD pattern were consistent with the indexed pattern of Cu 3 SnS 4 (PDF: 36-0217), confirming that the orthorhombic samples were successfully synthesized (Fig. 1a).The characteristic peak of orthorhombic CTS 333435 appears at 314 cm -1 from the vibration of SnS 4 34 shifts (Fig. 1b).The peak at 470 cm -1 is corresponding to Cu 2-x S 36.These seven peaks centered at 2 of 27.31 , 28.72 , 30.88 , 39.21 , 48.27 , 51.74 , and 56.33 were assigned to the (2 0 0), (0 0 12), (1 2 6), (2 0 12), (0 0 20), (2 0 18) and (2 0 20) planes, respectively (Fig. 1a).The crystallinity of the samples increased gradually.Spherical nanoparticles were successfully synthesized (Fig. S1).The lattice spacing of 0.32 nm (Fig. 1e) corresponding to (2 0 0) crystal plane of orthorhombic CTS-1 was observed from high resolution TEM (HRTEM) and the selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern showed diffraction rings, corresponding to the (2 0 0) and (2 0 20) planes of orthorhombic CTS.The average particle size of nano-sized CTS-1 was found to be 2.39 nm (Fig. 1d).EDX (Fig. S2) proved that the prepared sample contains only Cu (38.85 ), Sn (16.10 ), and S (45.05 ), and the elements were evenly distributed in photocatalyst from Mapping analysis (Fig. 1f).The element ratio proved that the existence of S vacancies in designed photocatalyst.To verify the strongest CO 2 adsorption ability of CTS-1, Fig. S10 showed the CO 2 adsorption isotherms of CTS-0.5, CTS-1 and CTS-2.Obviously, the CO 2 capture of CTS-1 was much higher than that of CTS-0.5 and CTS-2.The exact values of CTS-0.5, CTS-1 and CTS-2 were calculated to be 3.41, 6.45 and 2.39 cm 3 /g, respectively.The CO 2 adsorption ability of CTS-1 was three times that of CTS-2.The larger specific surface area of 63 m 2 g -1 was achieved at CTS-1 than the other two samples (46 m 2 g -1 for CTS-0.5 and 25 m 2 g -1 for CTS-2) from the calculated Brunner-Emmet-Teller (BET) specific surface areas (S BET ) and all samples showed a type IV isotherm with H 3 hysteresis loops, conformed mesoporous structure formation (Fig. 1c) and pore size distributions of the samples were shown in Fig. S3. The valence state and content of Cu, Sn and S exposed on CTS surface intrinsically influenced the photoreduction process from CO 2 to CH 4 , because of sulfur-deficient in Cu 3 SnS 4 induced the imbalance of electron around Cu, Sn and S atoms.Two peaks positioned at 2p 3/2 (932 eV) and 2p 1/2 (954.6 eV) in Cu 2p spectrum (Fig. 2a) revealed the presence of Cu(I) and Cu(II) ions on CTS surface 37,38.Binding energy (BE) of Cu (I) shift from 932.4 eV to 931.9 eV was accompanied with BE of Cu (II) shift from 934.6 eV to 934.1 eV confirmed the decrease of copper atoms valence state 39.S vacancy increased the electron density of Cu(I) 2p orbital, which led to the decrease of their binding energies.The content percentage of Cu(I) ions in prepared CTS was gradually increased (79 , 86 , 90 for CTS-0.5, CTS-1 and CTS-2, respectively).Sn 3d spectrum was observed with two peaks of Sn 3d 5/2 (495.2 eV) and Sn 3d 3/2 (487.3 eV), indicating Sn in both Sn(II) and Sn(IV) oxidation states 29.Peaks of Sn(II) 3d 5/2 (486.5 eV, 486.2 eV and 486.3 eV for CTS-0.5, CTS-1 and CTS-2, respectively), shift to lower binding energy, and then to higher binding energy, which indicated that the valence state of Sn atoms decreased 39.S vacancy increased the electron density of Sn (II) 3d orbital, which led to the decrease of their binding energies.The proportion of Sn(II) ions in prepared CTS was changed from 30 to for CTS-0.5 (30 ), CTS-1 (51 ) and CTS-2 (42 ), respectively.The spin-orbit doublet of S 2p 3/2 (161.7 eV) and S 2p 1/2 (164.6 eV), almost remained at the same position over the three samples (Fig. 2c).This revealed the presence of Cu(I)-S, Cu(II)-S, Sn(II)-S and Sn(IV)-S on the CTS surface. To further clarify the function of introduced S vacancy in the reaction of photoreduction CO 2 to CH 4 , it is crucial to reveal the characteristic of unpaired electrons with low spin level in S 3p orbit which induced the enhancement of its photocatalytic activity.S defect at g 2.003 in room temperature ESR spectrum was determined here (Fig. 2d) act as electron trap center to aggregate photogenerated electrons 31,40, which was ascribed to unpaired electrons in S 3p orbit induced Cu(II) and Sn(IV) transform to Cu(I) and Sn(II), respectively. Photocatalytic reduction properties of CO 2 were carried out under visible light ( 420 nm) irradiation emitted from 300 W Xe lamp without cocatalysts or sacrificial agents added.Detailed descriptions of CO 2 photocatalytic reduction measurement were presented in the Methods.The summary of photocatalytic experiment results could be found in Text S3. Yield of CH 4 (5.64,22.65 and 5.83 mol/g/h) and CO (16.27, 18.42 and12.87mol/g/h) were obtained on the surface of CTS-0.5, CTS-1 and CTS-2, respectively (Fig. 3).It should be noted that the production amount of CO did not increase with the increasing irradiation time after the initial first reaction hour, while the yield of CH 4 increased linearly with the irradiation time increasing during the whole reaction process and finally achieved at 83.10 selectivity with 22.65 mol/g/h CH yield.The cycle experiments were given in Fig. S4.CO production did not increase with the increasing irradiation time proving that CO was an intermediate in the reduction path of CH 4 .No H 2 gas was monitored here due to H 2 O being oxidized on the Sn(IV) site to generated H , which was transferred from Sn(IV) site to Cu(I) site to take part in CO 2 photocatalytic reduction.In order to illustrate this process, O 2 evolution experiment of on the surface of CTS-1was carried out here (Fig. 3f).The production amount of O 2 did not increase quickly after the first reaction hour from 149.05 mol/g/h to 29.75 mol/g/h, due to the reduction of subsequent CO release, which also proved that CO was an intermediate in this CH 4 generation path.The control experiments (Fig. 3) demonstrated that no CO or CH 4 was detected in the absence of either the photocatalyst or light, suggesting that the obtained reduced products were the result of the photocatalytic reaction on the surface of the photocatalyst.The carbon source in CO 2 reduction reaction had always been controversial, so it was very necessary to eliminate the error carbon source.In this work, no product was detected without CO 2 gas injection, which proved that the carbon source involved in CO 2 photocatalytic reduction only came from the CO 2 gas injected by us.The source of hydrogen protons was quite crucial to drive CO 2 photoreduction reaction, in other words, if enough hydrogen protons were not provided, the reduction reaction cannot be carried out successfully.In our work, no product was detected without water injection, indicating that water was a reducing agent, which was also the reason why we can detect the production of oxygen (Fig. 3f).To determine the driving force in photocatalytic reaction process, wave-length-dependent CH 4 and CO evolution performance of CTS-1 was measured to evaluate the apparent quantum yield (AQY) in Fig. S11 and Text S4.The corresponding AQY of CTS-1 at 410, 420, 450, and 490 nm were 1.06 , 0.66 , 0.45 and 0.24 , respectively, which was consistent with the trend of light absorption, suggesting that the CO 2 reduction reaction on CTS-1 was a typical photocatalytic driven process. Fabricated S vacancy had a crucial influence on effective photoactivity sites and adsorption sites, such as the adsorption of CO 2 , the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs and the photoreduction ability of photogenerated electrons, resulting in the enhanced photoreduction of CO 2 to CH 4 (Fig. 3).With the increase of S vacancy concentration, the amount of existing Cu(I) and Sn(II) was also changed accordingly (Fig. 2) resulting in CO 2 being adsorbed smoothly on Cu(I) atom (-0.195 eV binding energy) than Cu(II) atom (-0.185 eV binding energy) (Fig. 6) and the photoreduction ability of photogenerated electrons was strengthened ascribing to the introduced Sn(II) 5p (Fig. 5).Fig. 5 showed the electronic density of states (DOS) of CTS.For pure CTS (Fig. 5a andb), the CBM (conduction band minimum) mainly consisted of Sn(II) 5p states.Fig. 5c showed that for sulfur-deficient CTS, Sn(II) was obviously higher than that of Sn(IV) for the contribution of conduction band, meaning that electrons were enriched around Sn(II) atoms, so the electron recombination rate was reduced.The fluorescence intensity can be used to analyze the electron hole recombination rate due to some electron and hole pairs which recombine and release energy in the form of fluorescence.With the increase of existence of Cu(I) ratio, a significant decrease in PL intensity under PL excitation at 310 nm was detected in CST-1 compared to the other samples (Fig. 4a), indicating the highest number of electrons with the highest separation efficiency to perform the photo reduction of CO 2 .Time-resolved transient PL measurements of the fluorescence lifetime, that is, the time required for the fluorescence intensity to decay to the initial 1/e.The average emission lifetime (Fig. 4b) of CTS-1 (0.53 ns) was longer than that of CTS-0.5 (0.38 ns) and CTS-2 (0.41 ns).Due to the hybrid composite, the separation efficiency of photogenerated charge carriers to perform the photoreduction of CO 2 had slower PL decay with longer average lifetime than CTS-0.5 and CTS-2.The effective charge transfer and separation was demonstrated by the smallest diameter/radius semicircle of Nyquist impedance arc of CST-1 (Fig. 4d).The photocurrent density of CTS-1 was slightly higher than that of CTS-0.5 and CTS-2, revealed the highest separation efficiency of photogenerated charge carriers (Fig. 4c). ESR (Fig. 2d) proved the existence of S vacancy in the material, and CTS-1 had the most S vacancies.The more S vacancies in ESR, the more Cu(I) and Sn(II) in the low state around it, so the more Sn(II) existence in CTS-1, which was consistent with XPS analysis.CB position of Cu 3 SnS 4 was dominated by Sn(II) 5p orbital from Fig. 5c andd, so it can be regulated by controlling the ratios of Sn(II).With the most Sn(II) content percentage, the most negative conduction band position was achieved at CTS-1, revealing the strongest electron reduction ability to drive CO 2 photoreduction reaction (Fig. S5).The estimation of the conduction band potential (CBP) and valence band potential (VBP) is dynamic to understand the potential mechanisms of photocatalytic complexes for photocatalytic reactions using photoinduced charge transfer and separation.The Tauc plot (Text S1) derived from DRS spectrum depicts the optical band gap of 1.67 eV (Fig. S5a).The position of the conduction band and valance band of the prepared catalysts here was determined by extrapolation to the X intercept in the Mott-Schottky plot (Fig. S5b) and VB XPS (Fig. S5c), respectively.The transformation of Sn(IV) to Sn(II) due to S vacancy formation obviously increased the CTS-1conduction band position which was ascribed to the contribution of Sn(II) 5p orbital (-1.05 eV) and S 3p orbital (0.62 eV), which resulted in the driving force of CO 2 to CH 4 strengthening.The increase of S vacancy led to the increase of Sn(II) content, which made the conduction band position more negative and the electron reduction ability stronger.Therefore, the electron reduction ability on Cu(I) was also enhanced, which was conducive to the carbon dioxide reduction reaction. Thermodynamically, the redox potential of CO 2 to CH 4 was -0.24 V vs NHE, less than the -0.53 V vs NHE needed to produce CO, making the reaction more likely to produce CH 4 .Dynamically, CH 4 production is an 8-electron reaction much higher than the 2-electron reaction needed to produce CO.Due to the above stated the S vacancies could result in charge transfer to the surrounding Cu(I) atoms (reactive active sites), the higher density of surface photo-generated electrons meant the higher probability of multiple electron reactions (from CO 2 to CH 4 ) 31,32.The details about the DFT calculation (Text S2) of binding energy of CO 2 , H 2 O, CO and CH 4 could be found in Figs.S6-S9 or Tables S2-S5.From the binding energy of carbon dioxide and water on Cu(I), Cu(II), Sn (II), Sn(IV) adsorption sites, it could be concluded that Cu(I) possessed a stronger adsorption capacity for CO 2 , and Sn(IV) had inherently a stronger adsorption capacity for water (Fig. 6a andb).The redox reaction was separated spatially, and the recombination rate of electron holes was reduced, making the 8-electron reaction more likely to occur.At the same time, H produced on Sn(IV) was transferred to Cu(I), which guaranteed the selectivity of as-prepared S vacancy Cu 3 SnS to methane. In the process of carbon dioxide reduction, the different Gibbs free energy of different intermediate products will affect the selectivity of final products 29,31.Gibbs free energy calculations were carried out on these possible reaction pathways (Fig. 6).According to the calculated results shown in Fig. 6c, it was suggested that the formation of CH 2 O intermediates had a lower CH 2 O formation energy (G:1.270eV) than that of C (G:2.189eV) and HCOH (G:1.891eV).The formation of CH 3 O intermediates (Fig. 6d) had a lower CH 3 O formation energy (G:0.562eV) than that of CH (G:2.209eV) and CH 2 OH (G:1.007eV).We also carried out the complete Gibbs free energy calculations for CH 4 generation.According to the calculated results shown in Fig. 7a, it was suggested that the formation of CHO intermediates was the rate-limiting step for CTS-1.The formation of the CHO radical was an endothermic process, thus part of CO was desorbed to produce CO, and part of CO was used to produce CHO.The Gibbs free energy of CO 2 , CO and COOH were 0.494 eV, 0.596 eV and 1.387 eV, respectively.In addition, as revealed in Fig. 7a Based on the DFT calculation (Text S2) results and in-situ FTIR spectroscopy data, the most likely reduction path of the catalytic system was speculated as follows: To expound the structural stability of prepared photocatalyst during the reduction process, Raman spectra of CTS-1 after reaction were detected, as shown in Fig. 8a, from which, it should be noted that the characteristic peak locations were unchanged after the photoreduction process, proved the good stability of CTS-1.The S vacancy in Cu 3 SnS plays an important role on the activity and selectivity of the CO photoreaction, especially Sn(II) is considered to be stabilized by vacancy defects.There is no obvious change of S vacancy before and after the reaction detected using ESR detection (Fig. 8b).Thus, the stability of S vacancy also indirectly proves the stability of Sn(II) generated by the S vacancy.The peak area of the C-O peak 42 at a position of 1118 cm - decreased after the reaction (Fig. 8c), indicating that the sample had lower adsorption performance for CO, which was the intermediate of the CH 4 production path.This might explain why the CO production increased slightly and the CH 4 production decreased slightly after 15 h of reaction.In the spectrum, the Sn-S bond appeared at 670 cm -1 .The peak area of the CO 2 -peak 41,43 and HCOO -peak 31 at positions of 1204 and 1619 cm -1 .The mode at around 1508 cm -1 is m-CO 3 2-peak. The bands at 1544 cm -1 correspond to bicarbonate species HCO 3 -which arose from absorbed CO 2 and surface hydroxyls from dissociative H 2 O molecules 41.The bands at 1648 and 1695 cm -1 corresponded to bicarbonate species b-CO 3 2-peak 41.The doublet bands centered at 2350 cm -1 indicated the asymmetric stretching of CO 2 molecules 44,45.The peaks did not exhibit significant change before and after the reaction, which proved the stability of CTS-1. The change of the active sites in the materials before and after the reaction can affect the stability of the reaction.Over the surface of the CTS (2 0 0), the interaction of CO 2 and H 2 O molecules (Fig. 6) was studied at the DFT D2 level, Cu(I) and Sn(IV) preferentially absorbed CO 2 and H 2 O, respectively.CO 2 reduction and H 2 O oxidation proceeded separately, inhibiting occurrence of side reactions.After the reaction, the proportion of Sn(IV) decreased (Fig. 8e), the oxidation site of water decreased, reducing the transmission of H , so the CH 4 production rate decreased.The ratio of Cu(I) and Cu(II) before and after photocatalytic reaction over CTS-1 determined by the Cu 2p XPS spectra (Fig. 8d) exhibited a change.Meanwhile, peaks of Cu(I) 2p 3/2 shift to higher BE (from 932 eV to 932.2 eV) as well as the Cu(II) 2p 1/2 peak did (from 934.6 eV to 935 eV), which indicated that the valence state of copper atoms increased 39.It also meant the Cu(I) content decreased (from 79.76-79.40)after 5 h reaction, which could also explain the reactivity dropping slightly after 15 h.The ratio of Sn(II) and Sn(IV) by the Sn 3d XPS spectra exhibited a change (Fig. 8e) which can prove that there was the conversion between Sn(II) and Sn(IV).Peaks of Sn(II) shift to lower BE (3d 5/2 :from 486.2 eV to 486 eV, and 3d 3/2 :from 494.6 eV to 494.3 eV) as well as the Sn(IV) peak did (3d 5/2 :from 487 eV to 486.9 eV, and 3d 3/2 :from 495.6 eV to 495.5 eV), which indicated that the valence state of Sn atoms decreased 39.It also meant the Sn(IV) content decreased (from 49 to 47 ) after 5 h reaction, which explained the reactivity dropping slightly after 15 h.From Fig. 8f, XPS of S 2p spectrum exhibited a change before and after the photocatalytic reaction on CTS-1, which was due to the transformation between Sn(II) and Sn(IV), and the decrease of Sn(IV)-S led to a change on the S peak area.The peak position of S did not exhibit a change significantly, but the proportion of Sn(IV)-S decreased from 41 to 36 , which led to a change of on the S peak area.However, S was not the active site of the reaction, so it had no obvious effect on the stability of the reaction."}], "lamp": [{"llm generation": "Xenon", "source": "A 300 W Xenon lamp equipped with a 420 nm cutoff filter was utilized as a light source.", "context": "Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), Copper chloride (CuCl 2 2H 2 O), Sodium hydroxide (NaOH), Hydroxylammonium chloride (NH 2 OHHCl), Tin chloride pentahydrate (SnCl 4 5H 2 O), L-Cysteine were analytically graded.Distilled water was used throughout the experiment.

The valence state and content of Cu, Sn and S exposed on CTS surface intrinsically influenced the photoreduction process from CO 2 to CH 4 , because of sulfur-deficient in Cu 3 SnS 4 induced the imbalance of electron around Cu, Sn and S atoms.Two peaks positioned at 2p 3/2 (932 eV) and 2p 1/2 (954.6 eV) in Cu 2p spectrum (Fig. 2a) revealed the presence of Cu(I) and Cu(II) ions on CTS surface 37,38.Binding energy (BE) of Cu (I) shift from 932.4 eV to 931.9 eV was accompanied with BE of Cu (II) shift from 934.6 eV to 934.1 eV confirmed the decrease of copper atoms valence state 39.S vacancy increased the electron density of Cu(I) 2p orbital, which led to the decrease of their binding energies.The content percentage of Cu(I) ions in prepared CTS was gradually increased (79 , 86 , 90 for CTS-0.5, CTS-1 and CTS-2, respectively).Sn 3d spectrum was observed with two peaks of Sn 3d 5/2 (495.2 eV) and Sn 3d 3/2 (487.3 eV), indicating Sn in both Sn(II) and Sn(IV) oxidation states 29.Peaks of Sn(II) 3d 5/2 (486.5 eV, 486.2 eV and 486.3 eV for CTS-0.5, CTS-1 and CTS-2, respectively), shift to lower binding energy, and then to higher binding energy, which indicated that the valence state of Sn atoms decreased 39.S vacancy increased the electron density of Sn (II) 3d orbital, which led to the decrease of their binding energies.The proportion of Sn(II) ions in prepared CTS was changed from 30 to for CTS-0.5 (30 ), CTS-1 (51 ) and CTS-2 (42 ), respectively.The spin-orbit doublet of S 2p 3/2 (161.7 eV) and S 2p 1/2 (164.6 eV), almost remained at the same position over the three samples (Fig. 2c).This revealed the presence of Cu(I)-S, Cu(II)-S, Sn(II)-S and Sn(IV)-S on the CTS surface. To further clarify the function of introduced S vacancy in the reaction of photoreduction CO 2 to CH 4 , it is crucial to reveal the characteristic of unpaired electrons with low spin level in S 3p orbit which induced the enhancement of its photocatalytic activity.S defect at g 2.003 in room temperature ESR spectrum was determined here (Fig. 2d) act as electron trap center to aggregate photogenerated electrons 31,40, which was ascribed to unpaired electrons in S 3p orbit induced Cu(II) and Sn(IV) transform to Cu(I) and Sn(II), respectively. Photocatalytic reduction properties of CO 2 were carried out under visible light ( 420 nm) irradiation emitted from 300 W Xe lamp without cocatalysts or sacrificial agents added.Detailed descriptions of CO 2 photocatalytic reduction measurement were presented in the Methods.The summary of photocatalytic experiment results could be found in Text S3. Yield of CH 4 (5.64,22.65 and 5.83 mol/g/h) and CO (16.27, 18.42 and12.87mol/g/h) were obtained on the surface of CTS-0.5, CTS-1 and CTS-2, respectively (Fig. 3).It should be noted that the production amount of CO did not increase with the increasing irradiation time after the initial first reaction hour, while the yield of CH 4 increased linearly with the irradiation time increasing during the whole reaction process and finally achieved at 83.10 selectivity with 22.65 mol/g/h CH yield.The cycle experiments were given in Fig. S4.CO production did not increase with the increasing irradiation time proving that CO was an intermediate in the reduction path of CH 4 .No H 2 gas was monitored here due to H 2 O being oxidized on the Sn(IV) site to generated H , which was transferred from Sn(IV) site to Cu(I) site to take part in CO 2 photocatalytic reduction.In order to illustrate this process, O 2 evolution experiment of on the surface of CTS-1was carried out here (Fig. 3f).The production amount of O 2 did not increase quickly after the first reaction hour from 149.05 mol/g/h to 29.75 mol/g/h, due to the reduction of subsequent CO release, which also proved that CO was an intermediate in this CH 4 generation path.The control experiments (Fig. 3) demonstrated that no CO or CH 4 was detected in the absence of either the photocatalyst or light, suggesting that the obtained reduced products were the result of the photocatalytic reaction on the surface of the photocatalyst.The carbon source in CO 2 reduction reaction had always been controversial, so it was very necessary to eliminate the error carbon source.In this work, no product was detected without CO 2 gas injection, which proved that the carbon source involved in CO 2 photocatalytic reduction only came from the CO 2 gas injected by us.The source of hydrogen protons was quite crucial to drive CO 2 photoreduction reaction, in other words, if enough hydrogen protons were not provided, the reduction reaction cannot be carried out successfully.In our work, no product was detected without water injection, indicating that water was a reducing agent, which was also the reason why we can detect the production of oxygen (Fig. 3f).To determine the driving force in photocatalytic reaction process, wave-length-dependent CH 4 and CO evolution performance of CTS-1 was measured to evaluate the apparent quantum yield (AQY) in Fig. S11 and Text S4.The corresponding AQY of CTS-1 at 410, 420, 450, and 490 nm were 1.06 , 0.66 , 0.45 and 0.24 , respectively, which was consistent with the trend of light absorption, suggesting that the CO 2 reduction reaction on CTS-1 was a typical photocatalytic driven process. Fabricated S vacancy had a crucial influence on effective photoactivity sites and adsorption sites, such as the adsorption of CO 2 , the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs and the photoreduction ability of photogenerated electrons, resulting in the enhanced photoreduction of CO 2 to CH 4 (Fig. 3).With the increase of S vacancy concentration, the amount of existing Cu(I) and Sn(II) was also changed accordingly (Fig. 2) resulting in CO 2 being adsorbed smoothly on Cu(I) atom (-0.195 eV binding energy) than Cu(II) atom (-0.185 eV binding energy) (Fig. 6) and the photoreduction ability of photogenerated electrons was strengthened ascribing to the introduced Sn(II) 5p (Fig. 5).Fig. 5 showed the electronic density of states (DOS) of CTS.For pure CTS (Fig. 5a andb), the CBM (conduction band minimum) mainly consisted of Sn(II) 5p states.Fig. 5c showed that for sulfur-deficient CTS, Sn(II) was obviously higher than that of Sn(IV) for the contribution of conduction band, meaning that electrons were enriched around Sn(II) atoms, so the electron recombination rate was reduced.The fluorescence intensity can be used to analyze the electron hole recombination rate due to some electron and hole pairs which recombine and release energy in the form of fluorescence.With the increase of existence of Cu(I) ratio, a significant decrease in PL intensity under PL excitation at 310 nm was detected in CST-1 compared to the other samples (Fig. 4a), indicating the highest number of electrons with the highest separation efficiency to perform the photo reduction of CO 2 .Time-resolved transient PL measurements of the fluorescence lifetime, that is, the time required for the fluorescence intensity to decay to the initial 1/e.The average emission lifetime (Fig. 4b) of CTS-1 (0.53 ns) was longer than that of CTS-0.5 (0.38 ns) and CTS-2 (0.41 ns).Due to the hybrid composite, the separation efficiency of photogenerated charge carriers to perform the photoreduction of CO 2 had slower PL decay with longer average lifetime than CTS-0.5 and CTS-2.The effective charge transfer and separation was demonstrated by the smallest diameter/radius semicircle of Nyquist impedance arc of CST-1 (Fig. 4d).The photocurrent density of CTS-1 was slightly higher than that of CTS-0.5 and CTS-2, revealed the highest separation efficiency of photogenerated charge carriers (Fig. 4c). ESR (Fig. 2d) proved the existence of S vacancy in the material, and CTS-1 had the most S vacancies.The more S vacancies in ESR, the more Cu(I) and Sn(II) in the low state around it, so the more Sn(II) existence in CTS-1, which was consistent with XPS analysis.CB position of Cu 3 SnS 4 was dominated by Sn(II) 5p orbital from Fig. 5c andd, so it can be regulated by controlling the ratios of Sn(II).With the most Sn(II) content percentage, the most negative conduction band position was achieved at CTS-1, revealing the strongest electron reduction ability to drive CO 2 photoreduction reaction (Fig. S5).The estimation of the conduction band potential (CBP) and valence band potential (VBP) is dynamic to understand the potential mechanisms of photocatalytic complexes for photocatalytic reactions using photoinduced charge transfer and separation.The Tauc plot (Text S1) derived from DRS spectrum depicts the optical band gap of 1.67 eV (Fig. S5a).The position of the conduction band and valance band of the prepared catalysts here was determined by extrapolation to the X intercept in the Mott-Schottky plot (Fig. S5b) and VB XPS (Fig. S5c), respectively.The transformation of Sn(IV) to Sn(II) due to S vacancy formation obviously increased the CTS-1conduction band position which was ascribed to the contribution of Sn(II) 5p orbital (-1.05 eV) and S 3p orbital (0.62 eV), which resulted in the driving force of CO 2 to CH 4 strengthening.The increase of S vacancy led to the increase of Sn(II) content, which made the conduction band position more negative and the electron reduction ability stronger.Therefore, the electron reduction ability on Cu(I) was also enhanced, which was conducive to the carbon dioxide reduction reaction. Thermodynamically, the redox potential of CO 2 to CH 4 was -0.24 V vs NHE, less than the -0.53 V vs NHE needed to produce CO, making the reaction more likely to produce CH 4 .Dynamically, CH 4 production is an 8-electron reaction much higher than the 2-electron reaction needed to produce CO.Due to the above stated the S vacancies could result in charge transfer to the surrounding Cu(I) atoms (reactive active sites), the higher density of surface photo-generated electrons meant the higher probability of multiple electron reactions (from CO 2 to CH 4 ) 31,32.The details about the DFT calculation (Text S2) of binding energy of CO 2 , H 2 O, CO and CH 4 could be found in Figs.S6-S9 or Tables S2-S5.From the binding energy of carbon dioxide and water on Cu(I), Cu(II), Sn (II), Sn(IV) adsorption sites, it could be concluded that Cu(I) possessed a stronger adsorption capacity for CO 2 , and Sn(IV) had inherently a stronger adsorption capacity for water (Fig. 6a andb).The redox reaction was separated spatially, and the recombination rate of electron holes was reduced, making the 8-electron reaction more likely to occur.At the same time, H produced on Sn(IV) was transferred to Cu(I), which guaranteed the selectivity of as-prepared S vacancy Cu 3 SnS to methane. In the process of carbon dioxide reduction, the different Gibbs free energy of different intermediate products will affect the selectivity of final products 29,31.Gibbs free energy calculations were carried out on these possible reaction pathways (Fig. 6).According to the calculated results shown in Fig. 6c, it was suggested that the formation of CH 2 O intermediates had a lower CH 2 O formation energy (G:1.270eV) than that of C (G:2.189eV) and HCOH (G:1.891eV).The formation of CH 3 O intermediates (Fig. 6d) had a lower CH 3 O formation energy (G:0.562eV) than that of CH (G:2.209eV) and CH 2 OH (G:1.007eV).We also carried out the complete Gibbs free energy calculations for CH 4 generation.According to the calculated results shown in Fig. 7a, it was suggested that the formation of CHO intermediates was the rate-limiting step for CTS-1.The formation of the CHO radical was an endothermic process, thus part of CO was desorbed to produce CO, and part of CO was used to produce CHO.The Gibbs free energy of CO 2 , CO and COOH were 0.494 eV, 0.596 eV and 1.387 eV, respectively.In addition, as revealed in Fig. 7a Based on the DFT calculation (Text S2) results and in-situ FTIR spectroscopy data, the most likely reduction path of the catalytic system was speculated as follows: To expound the structural stability of prepared photocatalyst during the reduction process, Raman spectra of CTS-1 after reaction were detected, as shown in Fig. 8a, from which, it should be noted that the characteristic peak locations were unchanged after the photoreduction process, proved the good stability of CTS-1.The S vacancy in Cu 3 SnS plays an important role on the activity and selectivity of the CO photoreaction, especially Sn(II) is considered to be stabilized by vacancy defects.There is no obvious change of S vacancy before and after the reaction detected using ESR detection (Fig. 8b).Thus, the stability of S vacancy also indirectly proves the stability of Sn(II) generated by the S vacancy.The peak area of the C-O peak 42 at a position of 1118 cm - decreased after the reaction (Fig. 8c), indicating that the sample had lower adsorption performance for CO, which was the intermediate of the CH 4 production path.This might explain why the CO production increased slightly and the CH 4 production decreased slightly after 15 h of reaction.In the spectrum, the Sn-S bond appeared at 670 cm -1 .The peak area of the CO 2 -peak 41,43 and HCOO -peak 31 at positions of 1204 and 1619 cm -1 .The mode at around 1508 cm -1 is m-CO 3 2-peak. The bands at 1544 cm -1 correspond to bicarbonate species HCO 3 -which arose from absorbed CO 2 and surface hydroxyls from dissociative H 2 O molecules 41.The bands at 1648 and 1695 cm -1 corresponded to bicarbonate species b-CO 3 2-peak 41.The doublet bands centered at 2350 cm -1 indicated the asymmetric stretching of CO 2 molecules 44,45.The peaks did not exhibit significant change before and after the reaction, which proved the stability of CTS-1. The change of the active sites in the materials before and after the reaction can affect the stability of the reaction.Over the surface of the CTS (2 0 0), the interaction of CO 2 and H 2 O molecules (Fig. 6) was studied at the DFT D2 level, Cu(I) and Sn(IV) preferentially absorbed CO 2 and H 2 O, respectively.CO 2 reduction and H 2 O oxidation proceeded separately, inhibiting occurrence of side reactions.After the reaction, the proportion of Sn(IV) decreased (Fig. 8e), the oxidation site of water decreased, reducing the transmission of H , so the CH 4 production rate decreased.The ratio of Cu(I) and Cu(II) before and after photocatalytic reaction over CTS-1 determined by the Cu 2p XPS spectra (Fig. 8d) exhibited a change.Meanwhile, peaks of Cu(I) 2p 3/2 shift to higher BE (from 932 eV to 932.2 eV) as well as the Cu(II) 2p 1/2 peak did (from 934.6 eV to 935 eV), which indicated that the valence state of copper atoms increased 39.It also meant the Cu(I) content decreased (from 79.76-79.40)after 5 h reaction, which could also explain the reactivity dropping slightly after 15 h.The ratio of Sn(II) and Sn(IV) by the Sn 3d XPS spectra exhibited a change (Fig. 8e) which can prove that there was the conversion between Sn(II) and Sn(IV).Peaks of Sn(II) shift to lower BE (3d 5/2 :from 486.2 eV to 486 eV, and 3d 3/2 :from 494.6 eV to 494.3 eV) as well as the Sn(IV) peak did (3d 5/2 :from 487 eV to 486.9 eV, and 3d 3/2 :from 495.6 eV to 495.5 eV), which indicated that the valence state of Sn atoms decreased 39.It also meant the Sn(IV) content decreased (from 49 to 47 ) after 5 h reaction, which explained the reactivity dropping slightly after 15 h.From Fig. 8f, XPS of S 2p spectrum exhibited a change before and after the photocatalytic reaction on CTS-1, which was due to the transformation between Sn(II) and Sn(IV), and the decrease of Sn(IV)-S led to a change on the S peak area.The peak position of S did not exhibit a change significantly, but the proportion of Sn(IV)-S decreased from 41 to 36 , which led to a change of on the S peak area.However, S was not the active site of the reaction, so it had no obvious effect on the stability of the reaction."}], "reaction medium": [{"llm generation": "Gas", "source": "Gas phase photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was carried out in a closed gas cycle glass reactor, which was strictly vacuumized before the reaction.", "context": "Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), Copper chloride (CuCl 2 2H 2 O), Sodium hydroxide (NaOH), Hydroxylammonium chloride (NH 2 OHHCl), Tin chloride pentahydrate (SnCl 4 5H 2 O), L-Cysteine were analytically graded.Distilled water was used throughout the experiment.

To further clarify the function of introduced S vacancy in the reaction of photoreduction CO 2 to CH 4 , it is crucial to reveal the characteristic of unpaired electrons with low spin level in S 3p orbit which induced the enhancement of its photocatalytic activity.S defect at g 2.003 in room temperature ESR spectrum was determined here (Fig. 2d) act as electron trap center to aggregate photogenerated electrons 31,40, which was ascribed to unpaired electrons in S 3p orbit induced Cu(II) and Sn(IV) transform to Cu(I) and Sn(II), respectively. Photocatalytic reduction properties of CO 2 were carried out under visible light ( 420 nm) irradiation emitted from 300 W Xe lamp without cocatalysts or sacrificial agents added.Detailed descriptions of CO 2 photocatalytic reduction measurement were presented in the Methods.The summary of photocatalytic experiment results could be found in Text S3. Yield of CH 4 (5.64,22.65 and 5.83 mol/g/h) and CO (16.27, 18.42 and12.87mol/g/h) were obtained on the surface of CTS-0.5, CTS-1 and CTS-2, respectively (Fig. 3).It should be noted that the production amount of CO did not increase with the increasing irradiation time after the initial first reaction hour, while the yield of CH 4 increased linearly with the irradiation time increasing during the whole reaction process and finally achieved at 83.10 selectivity with 22.65 mol/g/h CH yield.The cycle experiments were given in Fig. S4.CO production did not increase with the increasing irradiation time proving that CO was an intermediate in the reduction path of CH 4 .No H 2 gas was monitored here due to H 2 O being oxidized on the Sn(IV) site to generated H , which was transferred from Sn(IV) site to Cu(I) site to take part in CO 2 photocatalytic reduction.In order to illustrate this process, O 2 evolution experiment of on the surface of CTS-1was carried out here (Fig. 3f).The production amount of O 2 did not increase quickly after the first reaction hour from 149.05 mol/g/h to 29.75 mol/g/h, due to the reduction of subsequent CO release, which also proved that CO was an intermediate in this CH 4 generation path.The control experiments (Fig. 3) demonstrated that no CO or CH 4 was detected in the absence of either the photocatalyst or light, suggesting that the obtained reduced products were the result of the photocatalytic reaction on the surface of the photocatalyst.The carbon source in CO 2 reduction reaction had always been controversial, so it was very necessary to eliminate the error carbon source.In this work, no product was detected without CO 2 gas injection, which proved that the carbon source involved in CO 2 photocatalytic reduction only came from the CO 2 gas injected by us.The source of hydrogen protons was quite crucial to drive CO 2 photoreduction reaction, in other words, if enough hydrogen protons were not provided, the reduction reaction cannot be carried out successfully.In our work, no product was detected without water injection, indicating that water was a reducing agent, which was also the reason why we can detect the production of oxygen (Fig. 3f).To determine the driving force in photocatalytic reaction process, wave-length-dependent CH 4 and CO evolution performance of CTS-1 was measured to evaluate the apparent quantum yield (AQY) in Fig. S11 and Text S4.The corresponding AQY of CTS-1 at 410, 420, 450, and 490 nm were 1.06 , 0.66 , 0.45 and 0.24 , respectively, which was consistent with the trend of light absorption, suggesting that the CO 2 reduction reaction on CTS-1 was a typical photocatalytic driven process. Fabricated S vacancy had a crucial influence on effective photoactivity sites and adsorption sites, such as the adsorption of CO 2 , the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs and the photoreduction ability of photogenerated electrons, resulting in the enhanced photoreduction of CO 2 to CH 4 (Fig. 3).With the increase of S vacancy concentration, the amount of existing Cu(I) and Sn(II) was also changed accordingly (Fig. 2) resulting in CO 2 being adsorbed smoothly on Cu(I) atom (-0.195 eV binding energy) than Cu(II) atom (-0.185 eV binding energy) (Fig. 6) and the photoreduction ability of photogenerated electrons was strengthened ascribing to the introduced Sn(II) 5p (Fig. 5).Fig. 5 showed the electronic density of states (DOS) of CTS.For pure CTS (Fig. 5a andb), the CBM (conduction band minimum) mainly consisted of Sn(II) 5p states.Fig. 5c showed that for sulfur-deficient CTS, Sn(II) was obviously higher than that of Sn(IV) for the contribution of conduction band, meaning that electrons were enriched around Sn(II) atoms, so the electron recombination rate was reduced.The fluorescence intensity can be used to analyze the electron hole recombination rate due to some electron and hole pairs which recombine and release energy in the form of fluorescence.With the increase of existence of Cu(I) ratio, a significant decrease in PL intensity under PL excitation at 310 nm was detected in CST-1 compared to the other samples (Fig. 4a), indicating the highest number of electrons with the highest separation efficiency to perform the photo reduction of CO 2 .Time-resolved transient PL measurements of the fluorescence lifetime, that is, the time required for the fluorescence intensity to decay to the initial 1/e.The average emission lifetime (Fig. 4b) of CTS-1 (0.53 ns) was longer than that of CTS-0.5 (0.38 ns) and CTS-2 (0.41 ns).Due to the hybrid composite, the separation efficiency of photogenerated charge carriers to perform the photoreduction of CO 2 had slower PL decay with longer average lifetime than CTS-0.5 and CTS-2.The effective charge transfer and separation was demonstrated by the smallest diameter/radius semicircle of Nyquist impedance arc of CST-1 (Fig. 4d).The photocurrent density of CTS-1 was slightly higher than that of CTS-0.5 and CTS-2, revealed the highest separation efficiency of photogenerated charge carriers (Fig. 4c). ESR (Fig. 2d) proved the existence of S vacancy in the material, and CTS-1 had the most S vacancies.The more S vacancies in ESR, the more Cu(I) and Sn(II) in the low state around it, so the more Sn(II) existence in CTS-1, which was consistent with XPS analysis.CB position of Cu 3 SnS 4 was dominated by Sn(II) 5p orbital from Fig. 5c andd, so it can be regulated by controlling the ratios of Sn(II).With the most Sn(II) content percentage, the most negative conduction band position was achieved at CTS-1, revealing the strongest electron reduction ability to drive CO 2 photoreduction reaction (Fig. S5).The estimation of the conduction band potential (CBP) and valence band potential (VBP) is dynamic to understand the potential mechanisms of photocatalytic complexes for photocatalytic reactions using photoinduced charge transfer and separation.The Tauc plot (Text S1) derived from DRS spectrum depicts the optical band gap of 1.67 eV (Fig. S5a).The position of the conduction band and valance band of the prepared catalysts here was determined by extrapolation to the X intercept in the Mott-Schottky plot (Fig. S5b) and VB XPS (Fig. S5c), respectively.The transformation of Sn(IV) to Sn(II) due to S vacancy formation obviously increased the CTS-1conduction band position which was ascribed to the contribution of Sn(II) 5p orbital (-1.05 eV) and S 3p orbital (0.62 eV), which resulted in the driving force of CO 2 to CH 4 strengthening.The increase of S vacancy led to the increase of Sn(II) content, which made the conduction band position more negative and the electron reduction ability stronger.Therefore, the electron reduction ability on Cu(I) was also enhanced, which was conducive to the carbon dioxide reduction reaction. Thermodynamically, the redox potential of CO 2 to CH 4 was -0.24 V vs NHE, less than the -0.53 V vs NHE needed to produce CO, making the reaction more likely to produce CH 4 .Dynamically, CH 4 production is an 8-electron reaction much higher than the 2-electron reaction needed to produce CO.Due to the above stated the S vacancies could result in charge transfer to the surrounding Cu(I) atoms (reactive active sites), the higher density of surface photo-generated electrons meant the higher probability of multiple electron reactions (from CO 2 to CH 4 ) 31,32.The details about the DFT calculation (Text S2) of binding energy of CO 2 , H 2 O, CO and CH 4 could be found in Figs.S6-S9 or Tables S2-S5.From the binding energy of carbon dioxide and water on Cu(I), Cu(II), Sn (II), Sn(IV) adsorption sites, it could be concluded that Cu(I) possessed a stronger adsorption capacity for CO 2 , and Sn(IV) had inherently a stronger adsorption capacity for water (Fig. 6a andb).The redox reaction was separated spatially, and the recombination rate of electron holes was reduced, making the 8-electron reaction more likely to occur.At the same time, H produced on Sn(IV) was transferred to Cu(I), which guaranteed the selectivity of as-prepared S vacancy Cu 3 SnS to methane. In the process of carbon dioxide reduction, the different Gibbs free energy of different intermediate products will affect the selectivity of final products 29,31.Gibbs free energy calculations were carried out on these possible reaction pathways (Fig. 6).According to the calculated results shown in Fig. 6c, it was suggested that the formation of CH 2 O intermediates had a lower CH 2 O formation energy (G:1.270eV) than that of C (G:2.189eV) and HCOH (G:1.891eV).The formation of CH 3 O intermediates (Fig. 6d) had a lower CH 3 O formation energy (G:0.562eV) than that of CH (G:2.209eV) and CH 2 OH (G:1.007eV).We also carried out the complete Gibbs free energy calculations for CH 4 generation.According to the calculated results shown in Fig. 7a, it was suggested that the formation of CHO intermediates was the rate-limiting step for CTS-1.The formation of the CHO radical was an endothermic process, thus part of CO was desorbed to produce CO, and part of CO was used to produce CHO.The Gibbs free energy of CO 2 , CO and COOH were 0.494 eV, 0.596 eV and 1.387 eV, respectively.In addition, as revealed in Fig. 7a Based on the DFT calculation (Text S2) results and in-situ FTIR spectroscopy data, the most likely reduction path of the catalytic system was speculated as follows: To expound the structural stability of prepared photocatalyst during the reduction process, Raman spectra of CTS-1 after reaction were detected, as shown in Fig. 8a, from which, it should be noted that the characteristic peak locations were unchanged after the photoreduction process, proved the good stability of CTS-1.The S vacancy in Cu 3 SnS plays an important role on the activity and selectivity of the CO photoreaction, especially Sn(II) is considered to be stabilized by vacancy defects.There is no obvious change of S vacancy before and after the reaction detected using ESR detection (Fig. 8b).Thus, the stability of S vacancy also indirectly proves the stability of Sn(II) generated by the S vacancy.The peak area of the C-O peak 42 at a position of 1118 cm - decreased after the reaction (Fig. 8c), indicating that the sample had lower adsorption performance for CO, which was the intermediate of the CH 4 production path.This might explain why the CO production increased slightly and the CH 4 production decreased slightly after 15 h of reaction.In the spectrum, the Sn-S bond appeared at 670 cm -1 .The peak area of the CO 2 -peak 41,43 and HCOO -peak 31 at positions of 1204 and 1619 cm -1 .The mode at around 1508 cm -1 is m-CO 3 2-peak. The bands at 1544 cm -1 correspond to bicarbonate species HCO 3 -which arose from absorbed CO 2 and surface hydroxyls from dissociative H 2 O molecules 41.The bands at 1648 and 1695 cm -1 corresponded to bicarbonate species b-CO 3 2-peak 41.The doublet bands centered at 2350 cm -1 indicated the asymmetric stretching of CO 2 molecules 44,45.The peaks did not exhibit significant change before and after the reaction, which proved the stability of CTS-1. The change of the active sites in the materials before and after the reaction can affect the stability of the reaction.Over the surface of the CTS (2 0 0), the interaction of CO 2 and H 2 O molecules (Fig. 6) was studied at the DFT D2 level, Cu(I) and Sn(IV) preferentially absorbed CO 2 and H 2 O, respectively.CO 2 reduction and H 2 O oxidation proceeded separately, inhibiting occurrence of side reactions.After the reaction, the proportion of Sn(IV) decreased (Fig. 8e), the oxidation site of water decreased, reducing the transmission of H , so the CH 4 production rate decreased.The ratio of Cu(I) and Cu(II) before and after photocatalytic reaction over CTS-1 determined by the Cu 2p XPS spectra (Fig. 8d) exhibited a change.Meanwhile, peaks of Cu(I) 2p 3/2 shift to higher BE (from 932 eV to 932.2 eV) as well as the Cu(II) 2p 1/2 peak did (from 934.6 eV to 935 eV), which indicated that the valence state of copper atoms increased 39.It also meant the Cu(I) content decreased (from 79.76-79.40)after 5 h reaction, which could also explain the reactivity dropping slightly after 15 h.The ratio of Sn(II) and Sn(IV) by the Sn 3d XPS spectra exhibited a change (Fig. 8e) which can prove that there was the conversion between Sn(II) and Sn(IV).Peaks of Sn(II) shift to lower BE (3d 5/2 :from 486.2 eV to 486 eV, and 3d 3/2 :from 494.6 eV to 494.3 eV) as well as the Sn(IV) peak did (3d 5/2 :from 487 eV to 486.9 eV, and 3d 3/2 :from 495.6 eV to 495.5 eV), which indicated that the valence state of Sn atoms decreased 39.It also meant the Sn(IV) content decreased (from 49 to 47 ) after 5 h reaction, which explained the reactivity dropping slightly after 15 h.From Fig. 8f, XPS of S 2p spectrum exhibited a change before and after the photocatalytic reaction on CTS-1, which was due to the transformation between Sn(II) and Sn(IV), and the decrease of Sn(IV)-S led to a change on the S peak area.The peak position of S did not exhibit a change significantly, but the proportion of Sn(IV)-S decreased from 41 to 36 , which led to a change of on the S peak area.However, S was not the active site of the reaction, so it had no obvious effect on the stability of the reaction."}, {"llm generation": "Gas", "source": "In-situ FTIR spectroscopy data of CTS-1 with CO 2 gas and H 2 O vapor were recorded in dark and under light illumination for 60 min to detect the intermediate products.", "context": "In summary, we fabricated S defected Cu 3 SnS 4 nanoparticles to realized precisely tailor the selectivity and reactivity of photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 to CH 4 , which attributed to the enhancement of electron reduction ability via introduction of both Cu(I) site and Sn(II) site.DFT calculations further proved the more negative CB position of Cu 3 SnS 4 was dominated by Sn(II) 5p orbital possessing the more stronger electron reduction ability.CTS possesses a Cu(I)-Sn(IV) (2 0 0) surface which promoted CO 2 /H 2 O adsorption and activation.Introducing S vacancies results in electron enriching around Sn(II) atoms, which made the conduction band position more negative, and the reduction ability of electrons on Cu(I) were enhanced accordingly, thus the reaction path was CO 2 COOHCOCHOCH 2 OCH 3 O CH 4 .CTS-1 exhibited 22.65 mol/g/h of CH 4 evolution and 83.10 selectivity.This work inspired a method to achieve the desirable CH 4 evolution from CO 2 photocatalytic reduction, meanwhile, more effort is needed in order to rationally design more efficient synergistic durable mental structures between adsorption site and photocatalytic activity site.
