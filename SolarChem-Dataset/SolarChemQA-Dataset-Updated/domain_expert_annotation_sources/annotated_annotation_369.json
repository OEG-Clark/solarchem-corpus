First, the carboxylate and hydroxyl groups in DOBDC can coordinate with Ti 4 in anatase TiO2 nanospheres.Then the nuclei of CPO-27-Mg can form on the surface of TiO2 through the coordination between Mg 2 and DOBDC under an appropriate solvothermal treatment.Due to the growth habit of CPO-27-Mg, these nanoparticles on TiO2 nanospheres can self-assembly to form spindle-shape CPO-27-Mg with TiO2 deposited on its surface.With prolonged reaction time, the size of the CPO-27-Mg on anatase TiO2 grow larger.Such an in-situ formation mechanism was previously observed in the formation of Zn-MOF-5/TiO234. In summary, CPO-27-Mg/TiO2 composite was successfully obtained via a hydrothermal in situ growth method.The CPO-27-Mg/TiO2 composite showed enhanced photocatalytic performance for CO2 reduction due to its high adsorption capacity toward CO2 and the existence of open alkaline metal sites in CPO-27-Mg.The in-situ hydrothermal method for the preparation of CPO-27-Mg/TiO2 composites ensures that there is strong interaction between CPO-27-Mg and TiO2, which makes CPO-27-Mg and TiO2 work synergistically.This work provides an effective method in direct constructing a MOF/semiconductor nanocomposite.It also highlights the promising prospect of incorporating MOFs with open alkaline metal sites into semiconductors for artificial CO2 photosynthesis.

Since the adsorption capacity toward CO2 plays an important role for photocatalytic CO2 reduction, the photocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction over ZIF-8/TiO2, a photocatalyst with comparable CO2 adsorption as that of CPO-27-Mg/TiO2, was also investigated under otherwise similar condition.It was found that 29.8 mol g -1 of CO and 14.7 mol g -1 of CH4 were produced over ZIF-8/TiO2 after 10 hour irradiations.Although these values are a little higher than those over pure TiO2 (22.5 mol g -1 of CO and 13.7 mol g -1 of CH4), they are much lower than those over CPO-27-Mg/TiO2 (40.9 mol g -1 of CO and 23.reduction 35,36. By incorporating CPO-27-Mg into TiO2, the reduction of H2O to H2 was completely inhibited in the process of photocatalytic CO2 reduction.The change of the product selectivity may be related to the alkaline environment caused by the incorporation of CPO-27-Mg.It is generally known that the photocatalytic CO2 reduction is a competing reaction of the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.The presence of the alkaline metal site in CPO-27-Mg is beneficial for the CO2 reduction owing to the lower reaction barrier for CO2 reduction in the alkaline environment.On the contrary, the release of H , which is an important step in the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, is suppressed in an alkaline environment 37,38."}, {"llm generation": "TiO2 spheres", "source": "Figure 3 (a) CO2 adsorption behaviors over CPO-27-Mg, TiO2 spheres, CPO-27-Mg/TiO2 and SBA-15/TiO2 nanocomposite.", "context": "-ray diffractometer (Cu K irradiations).The morphology of the product was characterized by a field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi-SU-8000).The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were measured by a JEOL model JEM 2010 EX instrument at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV.Thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) of the sample was performed on a Pyris Diamond TG/DTA thermo-gravimetric analyzer (PerkinElmer Thermal Analysis).Samples were heated under an air atmosphere from 30 to 800 C at 5 C/min.BET surface area and the CO2 adsorption were carried out on an ASAP2020M apparatus (Micromeritics Instrument Corp., USA).After the samples were degassed in vacuum at 200 C for 24h, the nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms were measured at -196 C, and CO2 adsorption isotherms were measured at 0 C.UV-visible absorption spectra (UV-DRS) of anatase TiO2 and the LMCT of O to Mg in an octahedral coordination environment, while the second absorption band in the range of 380-460 nm can be attributed to the absorption by the ligand DOBDC in CPO-27-Mg.The shoulder absorption extending to 600 nm, which is not observed in either the UV-vis spectra of pure TiO2 or CPO-27-Mg, should be attributed to the interaction between the O in DOBDC ligand and Ti in anatase TiO2, a confirmation that there exists intimate contact between CPO-27-Mg and TiO2 nanospheres.To investigate how the morphology of the CPO-27-Mg/TiO2 nanocomposite was formed, the time-dependent experiments were carried out and the SEM images of the products obtained in different reaction time were shown in Supporting FigureS5.The SEM image of the product obtained after 0.5h reaction shows that the surface of TiO2 nanospheres were covered with small particles.When the reaction time was prolonged to 10h, the SEM image of the product shows the deposition of TiO2 nanospheres on the spindle-like CPO-27-Mg with a length of 6m.With the reaction time prolonged to 72h, the length of the spindle was enlarged to 12m.We believed that the formation of the CPO-27-Mg/TiO2 nanocomposites with TiO2 nanospheres on the spindle-shaped CPO-27-Mg microcrystal is possibly due to the unique structure of CPO-27-Mg.CPO-27-Mg is a Mg 2 based metal-organic framework with unique 1D hexagonal channels and a special 1D threefold helical chains in its structure, which makes it prefer to growth longitudinally, as well evidenced in previous studies.Based on the time-dependent reactions, the formation of CPO-27-Mg/TiO2 composite between CPO-27-Mg and TiO2 was illustrated in Scheme 1.

Since the adsorption capacity toward CO2 plays an important role for photocatalytic CO2 reduction, the photocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction over ZIF-8/TiO2, a photocatalyst with comparable CO2 adsorption as that of CPO-27-Mg/TiO2, was also investigated under otherwise similar condition.It was found that 29.8 mol g -1 of CO and 14.7 mol g -1 of CH4 were produced over ZIF-8/TiO2 after 10 hour irradiations.Although these values are a little higher than those over pure TiO2 (22.5 mol g -1 of CO and 13.7 mol g -1 of CH4), they are much lower than those over CPO-27-Mg/TiO2 (40.9 mol g -1 of CO and 23.reduction 35,36. By incorporating CPO-27-Mg into TiO2, the reduction of H2O to H2 was completely inhibited in the process of photocatalytic CO2 reduction.The change of the product selectivity may be related to the alkaline environment caused by the incorporation of CPO-27-Mg.It is generally known that the photocatalytic CO2 reduction is a competing reaction of the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.The presence of the alkaline metal site in CPO-27-Mg is beneficial for the CO2 reduction owing to the lower reaction barrier for CO2 reduction in the alkaline environment.On the contrary, the release of H , which is an important step in the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, is suppressed in an alkaline environment 37,38."}, {"llm generation": "CPO-27-Mg/TiO2", "source": "Figure 3 (a) CO2 adsorption behaviors over CPO-27-Mg, TiO2 spheres, CPO-27-Mg/TiO2 and SBA-15/TiO2 nanocomposite.", "context": "-ray diffractometer (Cu K irradiations).The morphology of the product was characterized by a field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi-SU-8000).The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were measured by a JEOL model JEM 2010 EX instrument at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV.Thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) of the sample was performed on a Pyris Diamond TG/DTA thermo-gravimetric analyzer (PerkinElmer Thermal Analysis).Samples were heated under an air atmosphere from 30 to 800 C at 5 C/min.BET surface area and the CO2 adsorption were carried out on an ASAP2020M apparatus (Micromeritics Instrument Corp., USA).After the samples were degassed in vacuum at 200 C for 24h, the nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms were measured at -196 C, and CO2 adsorption isotherms were measured at 0 C.UV-visible absorption spectra (UV-DRS) of anatase TiO2 and the LMCT of O to Mg in an octahedral coordination environment, while the second absorption band in the range of 380-460 nm can be attributed to the absorption by the ligand DOBDC in CPO-27-Mg.The shoulder absorption extending to 600 nm, which is not observed in either the UV-vis spectra of pure TiO2 or CPO-27-Mg, should be attributed to the interaction between the O in DOBDC ligand and Ti in anatase TiO2, a confirmation that there exists intimate contact between CPO-27-Mg and TiO2 nanospheres.To investigate how the morphology of the CPO-27-Mg/TiO2 nanocomposite was formed, the time-dependent experiments were carried out and the SEM images of the products obtained in different reaction time were shown in Supporting FigureS5.The SEM image of the product obtained after 0.5h reaction shows that the surface of TiO2 nanospheres were covered with small particles.When the reaction time was prolonged to 10h, the SEM image of the product shows the deposition of TiO2 nanospheres on the spindle-like CPO-27-Mg with a length of 6m.With the reaction time prolonged to 72h, the length of the spindle was enlarged to 12m.We believed that the formation of the CPO-27-Mg/TiO2 nanocomposites with TiO2 nanospheres on the spindle-shaped CPO-27-Mg microcrystal is possibly due to the unique structure of CPO-27-Mg.CPO-27-Mg is a Mg 2 based metal-organic framework with unique 1D hexagonal channels and a special 1D threefold helical chains in its structure, which makes it prefer to growth longitudinally, as well evidenced in previous studies.Based on the time-dependent reactions, the formation of CPO-27-Mg/TiO2 composite between CPO-27-Mg and TiO2 was illustrated in Scheme 1. First, the carboxylate and hydroxyl groups in DOBDC can coordinate with Ti 4 in anatase TiO2 nanospheres.Then the nuclei of CPO-27-Mg can form on the surface of TiO2 through the coordination between Mg 2 and DOBDC under an appropriate solvothermal treatment.Due to the growth habit of CPO-27-Mg, these nanoparticles on TiO2 nanospheres can self-assembly to form spindle-shape CPO-27-Mg with TiO2 deposited on its surface.With prolonged reaction time, the size of the CPO-27-Mg on anatase TiO2 grow larger.Such an in-situ formation mechanism was previously observed in the formation of Zn-MOF-5/TiO234. In summary, CPO-27-Mg/TiO2 composite was successfully obtained via a hydrothermal in situ growth method.The CPO-27-Mg/TiO2 composite showed enhanced photocatalytic performance for CO2 reduction due to its high adsorption capacity toward CO2 and the existence of open alkaline metal sites in CPO-27-Mg.The in-situ hydrothermal method for the preparation of CPO-27-Mg/TiO2 composites ensures that there is strong interaction between CPO-27-Mg and TiO2, which makes CPO-27-Mg and TiO2 work synergistically.This work provides an effective method in direct constructing a MOF/semiconductor nanocomposite.It also highlights the promising prospect of incorporating MOFs with open alkaline metal sites into semiconductors for artificial CO2 photosynthesis.

By incorporating CPO-27-Mg into TiO2, the reduction of H2O to H2 was completely inhibited in the process of photocatalytic CO2 reduction.The change of the product selectivity may be related to the alkaline environment caused by the incorporation of CPO-27-Mg.It is generally known that the photocatalytic CO2 reduction is a competing reaction of the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.The presence of the alkaline metal site in CPO-27-Mg is beneficial for the CO2 reduction owing to the lower reaction barrier for CO2 reduction in the alkaline environment.On the contrary, the release of H , which is an important step in the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, is suppressed in an alkaline environment 37,38."}, {"llm generation": "CPO-27-Mg", "source": "Figure 5 (a) Yield of H2, CO, CH4 and O2 over irradiated CPO-27-Mg/TiO2 nanocomposite, TiO2 nanospheres, CPO-27-Mg for 10h.", "context": "-ray diffractometer (Cu K irradiations).The morphology of the product was characterized by a field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi-SU-8000).The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were measured by a JEOL model JEM 2010 EX instrument at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV.Thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) of the sample was performed on a Pyris Diamond TG/DTA thermo-gravimetric analyzer (PerkinElmer Thermal Analysis).Samples were heated under an air atmosphere from 30 to 800 C at 5 C/min.BET surface area and the CO2 adsorption were carried out on an ASAP2020M apparatus (Micromeritics Instrument Corp., USA).After the samples were degassed in vacuum at 200 C for 24h, the nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms were measured at -196 C, and CO2 adsorption isotherms were measured at 0 C.UV-visible absorption spectra (UV-DRS) of anatase TiO2 and the LMCT of O to Mg in an octahedral coordination environment, while the second absorption band in the range of 380-460 nm can be attributed to the absorption by the ligand DOBDC in CPO-27-Mg.The shoulder absorption extending to 600 nm, which is not observed in either the UV-vis spectra of pure TiO2 or CPO-27-Mg, should be attributed to the interaction between the O in DOBDC ligand and Ti in anatase TiO2, a confirmation that there exists intimate contact between CPO-27-Mg and TiO2 nanospheres.To investigate how the morphology of the CPO-27-Mg/TiO2 nanocomposite was formed, the time-dependent experiments were carried out and the SEM images of the products obtained in different reaction time were shown in Supporting FigureS5.The SEM image of the product obtained after 0.5h reaction shows that the surface of TiO2 nanospheres were covered with small particles.When the reaction time was prolonged to 10h, the SEM image of the product shows the deposition of TiO2 nanospheres on the spindle-like CPO-27-Mg with a length of 6m.With the reaction time prolonged to 72h, the length of the spindle was enlarged to 12m.We believed that the formation of the CPO-27-Mg/TiO2 nanocomposites with TiO2 nanospheres on the spindle-shaped CPO-27-Mg microcrystal is possibly due to the unique structure of CPO-27-Mg.CPO-27-Mg is a Mg 2 based metal-organic framework with unique 1D hexagonal channels and a special 1D threefold helical chains in its structure, which makes it prefer to growth longitudinally, as well evidenced in previous studies.Based on the time-dependent reactions, the formation of CPO-27-Mg/TiO2 composite between CPO-27-Mg and TiO2 was illustrated in Scheme 1. First, the carboxylate and hydroxyl groups in DOBDC can coordinate with Ti 4 in anatase TiO2 nanospheres.Then the nuclei of CPO-27-Mg can form on the surface of TiO2 through the coordination between Mg 2 and DOBDC under an appropriate solvothermal treatment.Due to the growth habit of CPO-27-Mg, these nanoparticles on TiO2 nanospheres can self-assembly to form spindle-shape CPO-27-Mg with TiO2 deposited on its surface.With prolonged reaction time, the size of the CPO-27-Mg on anatase TiO2 grow larger.Such an in-situ formation mechanism was previously observed in the formation of Zn-MOF-5/TiO234. In summary, CPO-27-Mg/TiO2 composite was successfully obtained via a hydrothermal in situ growth method.The CPO-27-Mg/TiO2 composite showed enhanced photocatalytic performance for CO2 reduction due to its high adsorption capacity toward CO2 and the existence of open alkaline metal sites in CPO-27-Mg.The in-situ hydrothermal method for the preparation of CPO-27-Mg/TiO2 composites ensures that there is strong interaction between CPO-27-Mg and TiO2, which makes CPO-27-Mg and TiO2 work synergistically.This work provides an effective method in direct constructing a MOF/semiconductor nanocomposite.It also highlights the promising prospect of incorporating MOFs with open alkaline metal sites into semiconductors for artificial CO2 photosynthesis.

CPO-27-Mg/TiO2 composite was synthesized via a mixed solvo-thermal method from H4DOBDC and Mg(NO3)26H2O in the presence of the as-prepared TiO2 nanospheres following the procedures previously reported 33.H4DOBDC (0.121 g, 0.61 mmol) was dissolved in THF (18 ml) in the 50ml Teflon inlet of autoclave and NaOH (2.5 ml, 1 mol L -1 ) was added to this solution under constant stirring.The as-prepared TiO2 nanospheres (0.16 g, 2 mmol) and Mg(NO3)26H2O (0.312g, 1.21 mmol) in 5ml de-ionized water was added to the above mentioned solution.After 30 min vigorous stirring, the autoclave was sealed and reacted at 110 C for 3days.The as-obtained product was collected by filtration, washed thoroughly with methanol and dried at 60 C in vacuum.For comparison, SBA-15/TiO2 was prepared from TiOSO4 and SBA-15 via a hydrothermal method.ZIF-8/TiO2 was prepared from 2-methylimidazole, Zn(NO3)26H2O and TiO2 nanosphere.

Before the photocatalytic CO2 reduction, the photocatalysts were treated under vacuum at 200 C to remove the solvent.The photocatalytic reactions were performed in a 10 ml quartz schlenk tube pre-saturated with CO2 atmosphere in the presence of saturated water vapor.10 mg of photocatalyst was evacuated and purged with CO2. Four 4W UV lamps with a wavelength centered at 365 nm were used as illuminating source.The amounts of CH4, H2 and O2 evolved after reaction were analyzed by using a GC-TCD-FID (Shimadzu GC-2014) with a TDX-01 packed column.CO was converted to CH4 by a methanation reactor and then analyzed by using the FID detector of GC."}, {"llm generation": "365 nm UV light", "source": "When CPO-27-Mg/TiO2 was irradiated with 365 nm UV light, 40.9 mol g -1 of CO and 23.5 mol g -1 of CH4 as well as 62.9 mol g -1 of O2 were detected after 10 hour irradiations (Figure 5a).", "context": "Anatase TiO2 nanospheres were prepared from TiOSO4 and was used for the in-situ construction of the CPO-27-Mg/TiO2 composite by reacting with Mg (NO3)2 and H4DOBDC hydrothermally.The XRD pattern of the as-prepared product show diffraction peaks attributable to CPO-27-Mg, in addition to those corresponding to anatase TiO2 (Figure 1).The SEM image shows that spindle-shaped microcrystals in a dimension of about 10m were densely cover with nanospheres in a size of 300500 nm (Figure 2a).By comparing with pure CPO-27-Mg and TiO2 nanospheres, it is obvious that the formation of the composite does not influence their original morphology (Supporting Figure S1,S2).The TEM image of the CPO-27-Mg/TiO2 composite exhibits the close adherence of the TiO2 nanospheres on the spindle-shaped CPO-27-Mg microcrystal.A clear lattice fringe of 0.352 nm observed in the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image can be assigned to the inter-planar distance between adjacent (101) crystallographic planes of anatase TiO2 (Figure 2b).TG analysis was carried out to quantify the weight ratio of CPO-27-Mg in the composite. The TG of the composite exhibits three weight losses, among which the third weight loss in the range of 420-510C can be assigned to the decomposition of the framework of CPO-27-Mg (Supporting Figure S3) 33.Based on the TG result, the amount of CPO-27-Mg in the composite was determined to be 39.3 wt.As expected, the BET specific surface area of the as-prepared CPO-27-Mg/TiO2 (416.81 m 2 g -1 ) is much higher than that of pure TiO2 nanospheres (92.35 m 2 g -1 ) (Supporting Figure . S4). Besides this, the incorporation of CPO-27-Mg also leads to a significant increase of the adsorption capability toward CO2 from the original 19.94 cm 3 g -1 for TiO2 to 106.59 cm 3 g -1 for the composite (Figure 3).It is believed that the enhancement of the adsorption capability toward CO2 may promote its photocatalytic performance for CO2 reduction. The UV/Vis DRS spectra of the as-obtained CPO-27-Mg/TiO2 composite shows two main absorption in the range of 200-380nm and 380-460 nm together with a shoulder peak extending to 600 nm, in accordance with its brown yellow color (Figure 4).By comparing it with that of pure CPO-27-Mg and TiO2 nanospheres, it is obvious that the first UV absorption can be ascribed to the overlap of the band gap absorption To study the influence of CPO-27-Mg on the photocatalytic performance of TiO2, the photocatalytic CO2 reduction were carried out over CPO-27-Mg/TiO2 in a CO2 atmosphere with water vapor.Although CPO-27-Mg/TiO2 composite shows absorption in the visible region, no reduction product was observed when it was irradiated with visible light.When CPO-27-Mg/TiO2 was irradiated with 365 nm UV light, 40.9 mol g -1 of CO and 23.5 mol g -1 of CH4 as well as 62.9 mol g -1 of O2 were detected after 10 hour irradiations (Figure 5a).On the contrary, only 22.5 mol g -1 of CO and 13.7 mol g -1 of CH4 were produced over irradiated TiO2 nanospheres. In addition to the products from CO2 reduction, 11.3 mol g -1 of H2 was also produced over pure TiO2.Both the amount of CO and CH4 produced over CPO-27-Mg/TiO2 is much higher than that over the pure TiO2.Moreover, the incorporation of CPO-27-Mg into TiO2 can totally inhibit the reduction of H2O to form H2, which is a competitive reaction of the CO2 reduction. For comparison, the photocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction over a physical mixture of TiO2 and CPO-27-Mg (with the ratio of TiO2 to CPO-27-Mg in 6: 4) was also studied and was compared with that of the CPO-27-Mg/TiO2 composite.It was found that 8.5 mol g -1 of H2, 18.9 mol g -1 of CO and 7.1 mol g -1 of CH4 were produced over a physical mixture of TiO2 and CPO-27-Mg under otherwise similar condition.Both the amount of CO and CH4 produced over the mixture is much lower than that over CPO-27-Mg/TiO2 nanocomposite (40.9 mol g -1 of CO and 23.5 mol g -1 of CH4), indicating the strong interaction between TiO2 and CPO-27-Mg formed via the in situ hydrothermal method is beneficial for the photocatalytic CO2 reduction. Usually the surface area of the photocatalyst plays an important role in the photocatalytic reaction.To differentiate the influence of the surface area on the photocatalytic CO2 reduction, the photocatalytic CO2 reduction over SBA-15/TiO2, a photocatalyst with comparable BET specific surface area as that of CPO-27-Mg/TiO2, was studied.It was found that 36.9 mol g -1 of CO was produced over SBA-15/TiO2 be 39.3, which exhibits the highest conversion of CO2 with 40.9 mol g -1 of CO and 23.5 mol g -1 of CH4 produced in 10 hours.A further increase in the CPO-27-Mg amount results in a decrease in the photocatalytic activity, which is likely due to a shading effect by the heavy loading of CPO-27-Mg. CPO-27-Mg/TiO2 is stable during the photocatalytic reaction as confirmed from the similar XRD patterns between the fresh and used CPO-27-Mg/TiO2 (Supporting Figure S6).The cycling results also showed that there was no obvious loss of the photocatalytic activity over CPO-27-Mg/TiO2 after three runs reaction (Figure 5c), another evidence for that the composition and structure of the photocatalyst was well preserved during the reaction."}, {"llm generation": "UV-Vis", "source": "UV-visible absorption spectra (UV-DRS) of anatase TiO2 and the LMCT of O to Mg in an octahedral coordination environment, while the second absorption band in the range of 380-460 nm can be attributed to the absorption by the ligand DOBDC in CPO-27-Mg.", "context": "-ray diffractometer (Cu K irradiations).The morphology of the product was characterized by a field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi-SU-8000).The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were measured by a JEOL model JEM 2010 EX instrument at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV.Thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) of the sample was performed on a Pyris Diamond TG/DTA thermo-gravimetric analyzer (PerkinElmer Thermal Analysis).Samples were heated under an air atmosphere from 30 to 800 C at 5 C/min.BET surface area and the CO2 adsorption were carried out on an ASAP2020M apparatus (Micromeritics Instrument Corp., USA).After the samples were degassed in vacuum at 200 C for 24h, the nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms were measured at -196 C, and CO2 adsorption isotherms were measured at 0 C.UV-visible absorption spectra (UV-DRS) of anatase TiO2 and the LMCT of O to Mg in an octahedral coordination environment, while the second absorption band in the range of 380-460 nm can be attributed to the absorption by the ligand DOBDC in CPO-27-Mg.The shoulder absorption extending to 600 nm, which is not observed in either the UV-vis spectra of pure TiO2 or CPO-27-Mg, should be attributed to the interaction between the O in DOBDC ligand and Ti in anatase TiO2, a confirmation that there exists intimate contact between CPO-27-Mg and TiO2 nanospheres.To investigate how the morphology of the CPO-27-Mg/TiO2 nanocomposite was formed, the time-dependent experiments were carried out and the SEM images of the products obtained in different reaction time were shown in Supporting FigureS5.The SEM image of the product obtained after 0.5h reaction shows that the surface of TiO2 nanospheres were covered with small particles.When the reaction time was prolonged to 10h, the SEM image of the product shows the deposition of TiO2 nanospheres on the spindle-like CPO-27-Mg with a length of 6m.With the reaction time prolonged to 72h, the length of the spindle was enlarged to 12m.We believed that the formation of the CPO-27-Mg/TiO2 nanocomposites with TiO2 nanospheres on the spindle-shaped CPO-27-Mg microcrystal is possibly due to the unique structure of CPO-27-Mg.CPO-27-Mg is a Mg 2 based metal-organic framework with unique 1D hexagonal channels and a special 1D threefold helical chains in its structure, which makes it prefer to growth longitudinally, as well evidenced in previous studies.Based on the time-dependent reactions, the formation of CPO-27-Mg/TiO2 composite between CPO-27-Mg and TiO2 was illustrated in Scheme 1. First, the carboxylate and hydroxyl groups in DOBDC can coordinate with Ti 4 in anatase TiO2 nanospheres.Then the nuclei of CPO-27-Mg can form on the surface of TiO2 through the coordination between Mg 2 and DOBDC under an appropriate solvothermal treatment.Due to the growth habit of CPO-27-Mg, these nanoparticles on TiO2 nanospheres can self-assembly to form spindle-shape CPO-27-Mg with TiO2 deposited on its surface.With prolonged reaction time, the size of the CPO-27-Mg on anatase TiO2 grow larger.Such an in-situ formation mechanism was previously observed in the formation of Zn-MOF-5/TiO234. In summary, CPO-27-Mg/TiO2 composite was successfully obtained via a hydrothermal in situ growth method.The CPO-27-Mg/TiO2 composite showed enhanced photocatalytic performance for CO2 reduction due to its high adsorption capacity toward CO2 and the existence of open alkaline metal sites in CPO-27-Mg.The in-situ hydrothermal method for the preparation of CPO-27-Mg/TiO2 composites ensures that there is strong interaction between CPO-27-Mg and TiO2, which makes CPO-27-Mg and TiO2 work synergistically.This work provides an effective method in direct constructing a MOF/semiconductor nanocomposite.It also highlights the promising prospect of incorporating MOFs with open alkaline metal sites into semiconductors for artificial CO2 photosynthesis.

Since the adsorption capacity toward CO2 plays an important role for photocatalytic CO2 reduction, the photocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction over ZIF-8/TiO2, a photocatalyst with comparable CO2 adsorption as that of CPO-27-Mg/TiO2, was also investigated under otherwise similar condition.It was found that 29.8 mol g -1 of CO and 14.7 mol g -1 of CH4 were produced over ZIF-8/TiO2 after 10 hour irradiations.Although these values are a little higher than those over pure TiO2 (22.5 mol g -1 of CO and 13.7 mol g -1 of CH4), they are much lower than those over CPO-27-Mg/TiO2 (40.9 mol g -1 of CO and 23.reduction 35,36. By incorporating CPO-27-Mg into TiO2, the reduction of H2O to H2 was completely inhibited in the process of photocatalytic CO2 reduction.The change of the product selectivity may be related to the alkaline environment caused by the incorporation of CPO-27-Mg.It is generally known that the photocatalytic CO2 reduction is a competing reaction of the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.The presence of the alkaline metal site in CPO-27-Mg is beneficial for the CO2 reduction owing to the lower reaction barrier for CO2 reduction in the alkaline environment.On the contrary, the release of H , which is an important step in the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, is suppressed in an alkaline environment 37,38."}], "lamp": [], "reaction medium": [{"llm generation": "Gas", "source": "The photocatalytic reactions were performed in a 10 ml quartz schlenk tube pre-saturated with CO2 atmosphere in the presence of saturated water vapor.", "context": "All the reagents are analytical grade and used without further purifications.TiO2 nanospheres were synthesized according to our previously reported method 32. CPO-27-Mg/TiO2 composite was synthesized via a mixed solvo-thermal method from H4DOBDC and Mg(NO3)26H2O in the presence of the as-prepared TiO2 nanospheres following the procedures previously reported 33.H4DOBDC (0.121 g, 0.61 mmol) was dissolved in THF (18 ml) in the 50ml Teflon inlet of autoclave and NaOH (2.5 ml, 1 mol L -1 ) was added to this solution under constant stirring.The as-prepared TiO2 nanospheres (0.16 g, 2 mmol) and Mg(NO3)26H2O (0.312g, 1.21 mmol) in 5ml de-ionized water was added to the above mentioned solution.After 30 min vigorous stirring, the autoclave was sealed and reacted at 110 C for 3days.The as-obtained product was collected by filtration, washed thoroughly with methanol and dried at 60 C in vacuum.For comparison, SBA-15/TiO2 was prepared from TiOSO4 and SBA-15 via a hydrothermal method.ZIF-8/TiO2 was prepared from 2-methylimidazole, Zn(NO3)26H2O and TiO2 nanosphere. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) data were collected using a Bruker D8 Advance of the powders were obtained for the dry-pressed disk samples using a Cary 500 Scan Spectrophotometer (Varian, USA).BaSO4 was used as a reflectance standard in the UV-visible diffuse reflectance experiment.

Four 4W UV lamps with a wavelength centered at 365 nm were used as illuminating source.The amounts of CH4, H2 and O2 evolved after reaction were analyzed by using a GC-TCD-FID (Shimadzu GC-2014) with a TDX-01 packed column.CO was converted to CH4 by a methanation reactor and then analyzed by using the FID detector of GC."}], "reactor type": [], "operation mode": [{"llm generation": "Batch", "source": "The cycling results also showed that there was no obvious loss of the photocatalytic activity over CPO-27-Mg/TiO2 after three runs reaction (Figure 5c), another evidence for that the composition and structure of the photocatalyst was well preserved during the reaction.", "context": "Anatase TiO2 nanospheres were prepared from TiOSO4 and was used for the in-situ construction of the CPO-27-Mg/TiO2 composite by reacting with Mg (NO3)2 and H4DOBDC hydrothermally.The XRD pattern of the as-prepared product show diffraction peaks attributable to CPO-27-Mg, in addition to those corresponding to anatase TiO2 (Figure 1).The SEM image shows that spindle-shaped microcrystals in a dimension of about 10m were densely cover with nanospheres in a size of 300500 nm (Figure 2a).By comparing with pure CPO-27-Mg and TiO2 nanospheres, it is obvious that the formation of the composite does not influence their original morphology (Supporting Figure S1,S2).The TEM image of the CPO-27-Mg/TiO2 composite exhibits the close adherence of the TiO2 nanospheres on the spindle-shaped CPO-27-Mg microcrystal.A clear lattice fringe of 0.352 nm observed in the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image can be assigned to the inter-planar distance between adjacent (101) crystallographic planes of anatase TiO2 (Figure 2b).TG analysis was carried out to quantify the weight ratio of CPO-27-Mg in the composite. The TG of the composite exhibits three weight losses, among which the third weight loss in the range of 420-510C can be assigned to the decomposition of the framework of CPO-27-Mg (Supporting Figure S3) 33.Based on the TG result, the amount of CPO-27-Mg in the composite was determined to be 39.3 wt.As expected, the BET specific surface area of the as-prepared CPO-27-Mg/TiO2 (416.81 m 2 g -1 ) is much higher than that of pure TiO2 nanospheres (92.35 m 2 g -1 ) (Supporting Figure . S4). Besides this, the incorporation of CPO-27-Mg also leads to a significant increase of the adsorption capability toward CO2 from the original 19.94 cm 3 g -1 for TiO2 to 106.59 cm 3 g -1 for the composite (Figure 3).It is believed that the enhancement of the adsorption capability toward CO2 may promote its photocatalytic performance for CO2 reduction. The UV/Vis DRS spectra of the as-obtained CPO-27-Mg/TiO2 composite shows two main absorption in the range of 200-380nm and 380-460 nm together with a shoulder peak extending to 600 nm, in accordance with its brown yellow color (Figure 4).By comparing it with that of pure CPO-27-Mg and TiO2 nanospheres, it is obvious that the first UV absorption can be ascribed to the overlap of the band gap absorption To study the influence of CPO-27-Mg on the photocatalytic performance of TiO2, the photocatalytic CO2 reduction were carried out over CPO-27-Mg/TiO2 in a CO2 atmosphere with water vapor.Although CPO-27-Mg/TiO2 composite shows absorption in the visible region, no reduction product was observed when it was irradiated with visible light.When CPO-27-Mg/TiO2 was irradiated with 365 nm UV light, 40.9 mol g -1 of CO and 23.5 mol g -1 of CH4 as well as 62.9 mol g -1 of O2 were detected after 10 hour irradiations (Figure 5a).On the contrary, only 22.5 mol g -1 of CO and 13.7 mol g -1 of CH4 were produced over irradiated TiO2 nanospheres. In addition to the products from CO2 reduction, 11.3 mol g -1 of H2 was also produced over pure TiO2.Both the amount of CO and CH4 produced over CPO-27-Mg/TiO2 is much higher than that over the pure TiO2.Moreover, the incorporation of CPO-27-Mg into TiO2 can totally inhibit the reduction of H2O to form H2, which is a competitive reaction of the CO2 reduction. For comparison, the photocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction over a physical mixture of TiO2 and CPO-27-Mg (with the ratio of TiO2 to CPO-27-Mg in 6: 4) was also studied and was compared with that of the CPO-27-Mg/TiO2 composite.It was found that 8.5 mol g -1 of H2, 18.9 mol g -1 of CO and 7.1 mol g -1 of CH4 were produced over a physical mixture of TiO2 and CPO-27-Mg under otherwise similar condition.Both the amount of CO and CH4 produced over the mixture is much lower than that over CPO-27-Mg/TiO2 nanocomposite (40.9 mol g -1 of CO and 23.5 mol g -1 of CH4), indicating the strong interaction between TiO2 and CPO-27-Mg formed via the in situ hydrothermal method is beneficial for the photocatalytic CO2 reduction.
