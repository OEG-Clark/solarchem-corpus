irradiation.Simultaneous production of hydrogen (H 2 ) and carbon-containing fuels (CO, CH 4 ) was observed.The CH 4 and H 2 production rates by Ag(0)/TiO 2 exhibited a two-fold enhancement compared with Ag(I)/TiO 2 .The Ag(0)/TiO 2 catalysts using TiO 2 (AB) as the support demonstrated 50 higher activity than using TiO 2 (A) as the support and more than three times higher activity than using TiO 2 (BA) and TiO 2 (P25) as the supports.In addition, the novel in situ photoreduction method of producing Ag(0) nanoparticles was superior to conventional ex situ photo-deposition and wet-impregnation methods, as evidenced by one order of magnitude higher activity of the catalysts prepared by the novel method.The superb activity of the Ag(0)/Ti(AB) catalysts was ascribed to their large surface area, small and well-dispersed Ag(0) nanoparticles, and an enhanced interfacial charge transfer between the anatase and brookite nanocrystals."}, {"llm generation": "TiO 2 samples", "source": "Independent batches of the TiO 2 samples were prepared and the results from the XRD and Rietveld refinement showed a less than 3 error in the brookite fraction for a certain sample, indicating good reproducibility of the catalyst preparation.", "context": "The crystal structure of the Ag(I)/TiO 2 and Ag(0)/TiO 2 composites was examined by XRD, as shown in Fig. 1.For Ag(I)/Ti(A), all the diffraction peaks were indexed to the pure anatase phase (JCPDS No. 21-1272).For Ag(I)/Ti(AB), the patterns indicated an anatase-rich mixture of TiO 2 anatase and brookite, the compositions of which were approximately 92 anatase and 8 brookite calculated by a Rietveld refinement method.The brookite phase (JCPDS No. 29-1360) was clearly discernible in the sample of Ag(I)/Ti(BA), from its unique (1 2 1), (2 2 1), and (0 3 2) diffraction peaks at 30.81, 42.34, 46.07 (2A).This brookite-rich Ag(I)/Ti(BA) had about 70 brookite and 30 anatase.Independent batches of the TiO 2 samples were prepared and the results from the XRD and Rietveld refinement showed a less than 3 error in the brookite fraction for a certain sample, indicating good reproducibility of the catalyst preparation.This result also agrees with the literature that bicrystalline TiO 2 anatase/brookite with controllable phases could be accurately fabricated by adjusting the hydrothermal environment 24,28.In agreement with the bulk phase analysis of XRD, the results from Raman spectroscopy (a very sensitive tool to approach the surface region of a solid sample) qualitatively indicated that the surface of Ag(I)/Ti(AB) was anatase-rich with a minor brookite, while the Ag(I)/Ti(BA) surface was rich in brookite phase (see Fig. S1 in Supporting Information).The crystal size of anatase and brookite phases for Ag(I)/TiO 2 was calculated and listed in Table 1.Ag(I)/Ti(A), Ag(I)/Ti(AB), and Ag(I)/Ti(BA) have a comparable crystal size of the anatase phase around 7 nm, smaller than that of Ag(I)/Ti(P25) (around 18 nm).The crystal size of the brookite phase in Ag(I)/Ti(BA) and Ag(I)/Ti(AB) is about 13 and 16 nm, respectively, and both are larger than the crystal size of anatase.It was noted that no diffraction lines of Ag species (metallic silver or silver oxides) were observed on the three untreated samples, suggesting that Ag species were well dispersed or the Ag particle size was very small 5,17.For Ag(0)/TiO 2 samples, the crystal structures and crystal sizes are same as Ag(I)/TiO 2 samples.Ag(0)/Ti(BA) remained in the original brookite-rich phase, and no metallic Ag(0) crystals were detected.The possible reason was that at a extremely low loading level (see the EDX results), Ag(0) was highly dispersed and this low concentration was likely below the detection limit of XRD. The morphology and textural properties of the Ag(I)/TiO 2 composites were analyzed by SEM and N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms.Fig. 2 shows the SEM images of Ag(I)/TiO 2 .The low magnification SEM images in Fig. 2a-c showed that the three samples were microspheres from submicrometer to micrometer size range.The high magnification SEM images in Fig. 2d-f showed a porous structure for all these microspheres, which were agglomerated ensembles of nanoparticles.The literature 24,29 and our previous studies 14,20 demonstrated that anatase TiO 2 had very fine particles in the size range of 8-10 nm.The anatase-rich TiO 2 aggregates of particles were in the size range of 50 nm, while the brookite-rich TiO 2 was made up of rod-like particles with diameters up to 50 nm and lengths up to 100 nm.The present SEM micrographs of Ag(I)/Ti(A), Ag(I)/Ti(AB) and Ag(I)/Ti(BA) in Fig. 2d-f well agree with the literature observations.For the in situ photoreduced Ag(0)/TiO 2 , their morphologies and particle sizes remained the same as the Ag(I)/TiO 2 . The distribution of Ag, Ti and O elements in the Ag(I)/TiO 2 and Ag(0)/TiO 2 was analyzed by X-ray elemental mapping, and the images are shown in Fig. 3.For all three samples, Ag(I)/Ti(AB), Ag(I)/Ti(BA), and Ag(0)/Ti(BA), the elemental mapping demonstrated that Ag species (green color) were highly dispersed on the The band gap, crystal size of anatase (A) and brookite (B) phase, BET surface area, BJH pore size, and BJH pore volume of these as-prepared (untreated) Ag/TiO2 catalysts.

The T-plots fitting results suggested that there were no micropores in the three porous microspheres of Ag(I)/TiO 2 (see Fig. S2 in Supporting Information).Table 1 compares the BET surface area, pore size and pore volume of the Ag(I)/TiO 2 composites.Ag(I)/Ti(A) had the largest BET surface area (188 m 2 g -1 ), nearly 3.5 times as high as Ag(I)/Ti(P25).Ag(I)/Ti(AB) has a slightly lower surface area than Ag(I)/Ti(A), but is higher than Ag(I)/Ti(BA).This difference in the surface area probably resulted from the increasing content of brookite.However, the pore sizes and volumes of the Ag(I)/Ti(A), Ag(I)/Ti(AB) and Ag(I)/Ti(BA) were comparable (around 5 nm and 0.2 cm 3 g -1 , respectively), much smaller than that of Ag(I)/Ti(P25).The higher surface area but smaller pore size of Ag(I)/Ti(A) compared with Ag(I)/Ti(P25) was probably due to the smaller size of anatase particles (8-10 nm) than P25 particles (20-25 nm) 11,28. Diffuse reflectance UV-vis spectra were recorded for the Ag/TiO 2 samples before and after the in situ photoreduction treatment, as shown in Fig. 5.For the untreated Ag(I)/TiO 2 (Fig. 5a), the absorption with an onset at around 380 nm was due to the band gap transition of TiO 2 .There was no surface plasma resonance (SPR) band around 400-500 nm for the Ag(0) particles.The absence of an SPR signal indirectly suggested the existence of Ag(I) on the as-prepared catalyst surface 17 For the treated Ag(0)/TiO 2 composites (Fig. 5b), the absorption edges of TiO 2 did not shift.Significantly different from the Ag(I)/TiO 2 , an obvious SPR band around 400-600 nm appeared on the Ag(0)/Ti(A), Ag(0)/Ti(AB), Ag(0)/Ti(BA) and Ag(0)/Ti(P25).This unique SPR peak reveals the reduction of Ag(I) into Ag(0) by photo-illumination in the presence of H 2 O/CH 3 OH vapor.Table 1 compares the band gaps of the as-prepared Ag(I)/TiO 2 composites derived from the UV-vis spectra in Fig. 5.With the increase of brookite content, the band gaps of Ag(I)/Ti(A), Ag(I)/Ti(AB) and Ag(I)/Ti(BA) slightly increased from 3.23 to 3.26 and 3.31 eV.It was noted that treatment did not narrow or enlarge the band gaps of the Ag(0)/TiO 2 , probably because Ag species were dispersed on the surface but not doped into the lattice of TiO 2 15.The reduction of Ag(I) to Ag(0) was also supported by the physical appearance of the catalysts.As shown in Fig. 6, the in situ photoreduction treatment induced the color change from initial dark gray to brownish or reddish gray.This color transformation was in agreement with the study by Kawahara et al. 30 that the reduction of Ag(I) to Ag(0) by UV light irradiation resulted in the appearance of a brownish gray color in the Ag-TiO 2 nanocomposite films.Krejcikova et al. 17 also found that Ag(0) was not present in the as-prepared Ag/TiO 2 at a low concentration (2 wt.), while the presence of metallic Ag(0) induced the color change from dark to yellow.The UV-vis spectra and the color change suggest that the untreated surfaces were dominated by Ag(I) and the treated surfaces were covered with the majority of Ag(0).The method of using CO as a smart IR probing molecule is often applied to identify the oxidation state of metals (e.g., Cu, Ag, Rh) 11,31323334.To confirm whether all the Ag(I) species are transformed into Ag(0) after photoinduced reduction of Ag(I)/TiO 2 , in situ DRIFTS of CO adsorption has been conducted on Ag/Ti(P25) before and after in situ photoreduction by introducing a certain amount of CO into the DRIFTS cell, because CO could be selectively coordinated with Ag(I) (2160-2170 cm -1 ) and Ag(0) (2020-2060 cm -1 ) at different positions 32,33.As shown in Fig. 7 and two weak peaks at 2069 and 2024 cm -1 for Ag(0)-CO 32,33.This observation indicated that the surface of Ag(I)/Ti(P25) was rich in Ag(I) species with minor Ag(0).For Ag(0)/Ti(P25) (after in situ photoreduction), the Ag(I)-CO peak at 2161 cm -1 significantly decreased.Meanwhile, a strong peak of Ag(0)-CO at 2024 cm -1 was observed, suggesting that Ag(0) dominated the photoreduced surface.The IR spectra changes after photoreduction indicate that the majority, but not all, of the Ag(I) was photoreduced to Ag(0).The transformation of Ag(I) to Ag(0) observed from the IR analysis agrees with the results from the analyses of UV-vis spectroscopy and the physical appearances of the samples. For the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with the water/methanol vapor mixture, CO and H 2 were found to be the major products with a minor CH 4 .Fig. 8 shows the production rates of CO, CH 4 and H 2 on the Ag(0)/Ti(A) as a function of time from one measurement.After 2 h, the production rates of CO, CH 4 and H 2 reached their maximum and steady state at 145, 5 and 1560 mol g -1 h -1 , respectively.Similar trends in production rates were also observed for Ag(0)/Ti(AB), Ag(0)/Ti(BA), and Ag(0)/Ti(P25) samples (data not shown here).Fig. 9 compares the steady-state H 2 , CO and CH 4 production rates on the various Ag(0)/Ti(M) (M A, AB, BA, P25) samples (three runs for each sample; error bars representing standard deviations).The experimental errors for the production rates of CO, CH 4 and H 2 are in the range of 5-15 (except for H 2 production over the Ag(0)/Ti(A) sample, which is 38), which are within reasonable experimental uncertainties and indicate good reproducibility of the activity measurements.The CO production rate was comparable for Ag(0)/Ti(A) and Ag(0)/Ti(AB), and it was nearly twice as high as that of Ag(0)/Ti(BA) or Ag(0)/Ti(P25).For the CH 4 and H 2 production rates, the activities of the four samples were in the order of Ag(0)/Ti(AB) Ag(0)/Ti(A) Ag(0)/Ti(BA) Ag(0)/Ti(P25).This finding demonstrates that the Ag(0)-coupled anatase-rich bicrystalline TiO 2 anatase/brookite is a promising catalyst toward the production of solar fuels from the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O.The finding that Ag(0)/Ti(AB) is more active than Ag(0)/Ti(A) is of great importance, since Ag(0)/Ti(AB) has a smaller surface area and a slightly larger band gap than Ag(0)/Ti(A) (see Table 1).The correlations of the TiO 2 crystal sizes (Table 1) with the photocatalytic activity data (Fig. 9) suggest the crystal size does not play a significant role in differentiating the activities of Ag(0)/Ti(A) and Ag(0)/Ti(AB).Even though the brookite crystal size is larger than that of anatase, the Ag(0)/Ti(AB) activity is still higher than that of Ag(0)/Ti(A).A most likely reason for this improved activity of Ag(0)/Ti(AB) is the enhanced interfacial electron transfer between anatase and brookite nanocrystals in Ag(0)/Ti(AB).The conduction band (CB) edge of brookite was about 0.14 eV more negative than that of anatase 24,25,35, which would induce transfer of the photoexcited electrons from brookite to anatase 28.In addition, Schottky barriers formed by the metal/semiconductor contact may exist at three interfaces of Ag(0)/Ti(AB), i.e., Ag(0)-anatase, Ag(0)-brookite, and Ag(0)-anatase/brookite heterojunctions.The Ag(0)-anatase/brookite interfaces may be more efficient in facilitating the electron migration from the TiO 2 to the Ag(0) sites.Hence, the combinational benefits from the electron transfer between the two phases and the Schottky barriers at the Ag(0)-anatase/brookite interfaces could have caused the higher activity of Ag(0)/Ti(AB) than Ag(0)/Ti(A).The higher activity of Ag(0)/Ti(AB) than Ag(0)/Ti(BA) was possibly because of the smaller surface area, the larger fraction of brookite that has a larger crystal size than anatase, and the larger band gap of Ag/Ti(BA) (see Table 1).There should be an optimum ratio of anatase/brookite, which depends on the photocatalytic activity of individual anatase and brookite phases, as well as the charge transfer between their interfaces.This study clearly indicates that anatase-rich A/B is more active than brookite-rich A/B; quantitative determination of this optimum ratio will be investigated in our future study.Another important finding is that Ag(0)/Ti(AB) is much more active than Ag(0)/Ti(P25).This finding indicates that the coupling of brookite to anatase is more effective than the coupling of rutile to anatase, likely because of a faster charge recombination rate within rutile crystals than within brookite 22,23 and less reduction ability of rutile due to the lower CB potential of rutile than brookite 27.The smallest surface area and the largest crystal size of Ag/Ti(P25) (see Table 1) may also contribute to its lowest photocatalytic activity. Besides the crystal phase effect of TiO 2 , the photocatalytic activities of Ag/TiO 2 were also affected by the Ag valence state.Fig. 10 compares the production rates of CO, CH 4 , and H 2 on the Ag(I)/Ti(AB)-SP and Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-SP.The production rates of CO were comparable on the Ag(I)/Ti(AB)-SP and Ag(I)/Ti(AB)-SP, but a fourfold and twofold enhancement was observed on Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-SP for the production rate of CH 4 and H 2 , respectively.This result demonstrated that Ag(0) obtained by the in situ photoreducion pretreatment played a more important role than Ag(I) for CO 2 reduction and H 2 O splitting.Ag(I) can act as an electron trapper to inhibit the charge recombination 16,18.However, the high reduction potential of Ag(I)/Ag(0) (0.8 eV) induces a strong interaction of Ag(I) with the trapped electrons.As indicated in the literature 18,36, this interaction could lead to a partial reduction of Ag(I) to Ag(0), consuming electrons rather than facilitating the trapped electrons to migrate to the surface-adsorbed CO 2 and H 2 O.This limitation hence lowers the photocatalytic performance of Ag(I)/Ti(AB)-SP.By contrast, Ag(0) serves as a sink to accumulate photogenerated electrons via the Schottky barrier at the Ag(0)-TiO 2 interface 5,9,10,17.As a result, more electrons are available on the Ag(0) sites, which promote the H 2 production from H 2 O splitting and the multi-electron process for CH 4 formation. To check the possibility of Ag(I)/TiO 2 transferring to Ag(0)/TiO 2 during the photocatalytic reaction and the repeated activity of Ag(I)/TiO 2 , the catalytic performance of Ag(I)/Ti(AB) for CO, CH 4 and H 2 production was conducted for three continuous UV on/off cycles.In each cycle, the UV light was turned on for 45 min and then turned off while the reactor was purged until no products were detected by the GC.The UV illumination time, 45 min, was consistent with the time spent during in situ photoreduction of catalysts with He H 2 O/CH 3 OH for preparing the Ag(0)/TiO 2 .Fig. S3 in Supporting Information shows the production rates of CO, CH 4 , and H 2 during the three-cycle process.The activity results demonstrated that the overall CO 2 photoreduction rate was increased over three cycles, most likely because of the transformation of Ag(I) to Ag(0).The three-cycle testing result again verifies our previous conclusion that Ag(0) species is more active than Ag(I) in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 by Ag/TiO 2 . To evaluate the significance of Ag(0) generated from the sequential spray pyrolysis and the in situ photoreduction treatment (SP method), two additional samples, prepared from PD and WI methods, were used as controls.Fig. 10 compares the activities of Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-SP, Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-PD and Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-WI.The maximum CO production rate of Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-SP was slightly higher than that of Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-PD, while its CH 4 and H 2 production rates were 9 and 3 times higher than that of Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-PD.The inferior activity of Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-PD likely resulted from its lower fraction of surface Ag(0).As supported by the UV-vis spectra of Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-PD (data not shown here), only a very weak SPR band for Ag(0) was observed, indicating a very small amount of Ag(0) on the catalyst surface.This result reasonably demonstrated that a high fraction of Ag(0) cannot be obtained by the ex situ photodeposition method in an air environment, while the in situ photoreduction treatment could avoid the partial oxidation of Ag(0) back to Ag(I).In addition, the CO, CH 4 and H 2 production rates of Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-SP were 7, 10 and 22 times higher than those of Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-WI.In agreement with our previous work 5, the result in this work again demonstrated the advantages of the spray pyrolysis process over the conventional wet-impregnation process by dispersing the Ag nanoparticles more uniformly on the TiO 2 surface. From all the photocatalytic activity results obtained (Figs. 9 and 10), one can see that the production rate of CH 4 was generally one order of magnitude lower than that of CO, while the production rate of H 2 was one order of magnitude higher than that of CO.The low CH 4 production from CO 2 photoreduction may be due to the following two reasons.First, an eight-electron transfer process to generate CH 4 is more difficult to proceed than a two-electron process to generate CO 5,10.Second, the CH 4 formation rate may be limited by that of CO, since CO may be the precursor for CH 4 generation 37.Possible reasons for the higher H 2 production from H 2 O splitting than CO and CH 4 from CO 2 photoreduction are: (1) the reduction potential of CO 2 /CO (-0.53 V at pH 7 vs.NHE) is more negative than that of H 2 O/H 2 (-0.41 V at pH 7 vs.NHE), making it easier to produce H 2 1,3,4; (2) the Ag(0) cocatalyst on TiO 2 facilitates H 2 production to a larger extent than it facilitates CO and CH 4 production. To evaluate the carbon source of CO and CH 4 , a control experiment was conducted on Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-SP with an introduction of helium (instead of CO 2 ) H 2 O/CH 3 OH vapor.In this control experiment, the production rates of CO and CH 4 were reduced by nearly 3 and 10 times compared with those using CO 2 as the feed gas.This result proved that CO and CH 4 were primarily derived from CO 2 and to a much less extent derived from CH 3 OH."}, {"llm generation": "Ag/TiO2 catalysts", "source": "For all three samples, Ag(I)/Ti(AB), Ag(I)/Ti(BA), and Ag(0)/Ti(BA), the elemental mapping demonstrated that Ag species (green color) were highly dispersed on the The band gap, crystal size of anatase (A) and brookite (B) phase, BET surface area, BJH pore size, and BJH pore volume of these as-prepared (untreated) Ag/TiO2 catalysts.", "context": "The crystal structure of the Ag(I)/TiO 2 and Ag(0)/TiO 2 composites was examined by XRD, as shown in Fig. 1.For Ag(I)/Ti(A), all the diffraction peaks were indexed to the pure anatase phase (JCPDS No. 21-1272).For Ag(I)/Ti(AB), the patterns indicated an anatase-rich mixture of TiO 2 anatase and brookite, the compositions of which were approximately 92 anatase and 8 brookite calculated by a Rietveld refinement method.The brookite phase (JCPDS No. 29-1360) was clearly discernible in the sample of Ag(I)/Ti(BA), from its unique (1 2 1), (2 2 1), and (0 3 2) diffraction peaks at 30.81, 42.34, 46.07 (2A).This brookite-rich Ag(I)/Ti(BA) had about 70 brookite and 30 anatase.Independent batches of the TiO 2 samples were prepared and the results from the XRD and Rietveld refinement showed a less than 3 error in the brookite fraction for a certain sample, indicating good reproducibility of the catalyst preparation.This result also agrees with the literature that bicrystalline TiO 2 anatase/brookite with controllable phases could be accurately fabricated by adjusting the hydrothermal environment 24,28.In agreement with the bulk phase analysis of XRD, the results from Raman spectroscopy (a very sensitive tool to approach the surface region of a solid sample) qualitatively indicated that the surface of Ag(I)/Ti(AB) was anatase-rich with a minor brookite, while the Ag(I)/Ti(BA) surface was rich in brookite phase (see Fig. S1 in Supporting Information).The crystal size of anatase and brookite phases for Ag(I)/TiO 2 was calculated and listed in Table 1.Ag(I)/Ti(A), Ag(I)/Ti(AB), and Ag(I)/Ti(BA) have a comparable crystal size of the anatase phase around 7 nm, smaller than that of Ag(I)/Ti(P25) (around 18 nm).The crystal size of the brookite phase in Ag(I)/Ti(BA) and Ag(I)/Ti(AB) is about 13 and 16 nm, respectively, and both are larger than the crystal size of anatase.It was noted that no diffraction lines of Ag species (metallic silver or silver oxides) were observed on the three untreated samples, suggesting that Ag species were well dispersed or the Ag particle size was very small 5,17.For Ag(0)/TiO 2 samples, the crystal structures and crystal sizes are same as Ag(I)/TiO 2 samples.Ag(0)/Ti(BA) remained in the original brookite-rich phase, and no metallic Ag(0) crystals were detected.The possible reason was that at a extremely low loading level (see the EDX results), Ag(0) was highly dispersed and this low concentration was likely below the detection limit of XRD.

Diffuse reflectance UV-vis spectra were recorded for the Ag/TiO 2 samples before and after the in situ photoreduction treatment, as shown in Fig. 5.For the untreated Ag(I)/TiO 2 (Fig. 5a), the absorption with an onset at around 380 nm was due to the band gap transition of TiO 2 .There was no surface plasma resonance (SPR) band around 400-500 nm for the Ag(0) particles.The absence of an SPR signal indirectly suggested the existence of Ag(I) on the as-prepared catalyst surface 17 For the treated Ag(0)/TiO 2 composites (Fig. 5b), the absorption edges of TiO 2 did not shift.Significantly different from the Ag(I)/TiO 2 , an obvious SPR band around 400-600 nm appeared on the Ag(0)/Ti(A), Ag(0)/Ti(AB), Ag(0)/Ti(BA) and Ag(0)/Ti(P25).This unique SPR peak reveals the reduction of Ag(I) into Ag(0) by photo-illumination in the presence of H 2 O/CH 3 OH vapor.Table 1 compares the band gaps of the as-prepared Ag(I)/TiO 2 composites derived from the UV-vis spectra in Fig. 5.With the increase of brookite content, the band gaps of Ag(I)/Ti(A), Ag(I)/Ti(AB) and Ag(I)/Ti(BA) slightly increased from 3.23 to 3.26 and 3.31 eV.It was noted that treatment did not narrow or enlarge the band gaps of the Ag(0)/TiO 2 , probably because Ag species were dispersed on the surface but not doped into the lattice of TiO 2 15.The reduction of Ag(I) to Ag(0) was also supported by the physical appearance of the catalysts.As shown in Fig. 6, the in situ photoreduction treatment induced the color change from initial dark gray to brownish or reddish gray.This color transformation was in agreement with the study by Kawahara et al. 30 that the reduction of Ag(I) to Ag(0) by UV light irradiation resulted in the appearance of a brownish gray color in the Ag-TiO 2 nanocomposite films.Krejcikova et al. 17 also found that Ag(0) was not present in the as-prepared Ag/TiO 2 at a low concentration (2 wt.), while the presence of metallic Ag(0) induced the color change from dark to yellow.The UV-vis spectra and the color change suggest that the untreated surfaces were dominated by Ag(I) and the treated surfaces were covered with the majority of Ag(0).The method of using CO as a smart IR probing molecule is often applied to identify the oxidation state of metals (e.g., Cu, Ag, Rh) 11,31323334.To confirm whether all the Ag(I) species are transformed into Ag(0) after photoinduced reduction of Ag(I)/TiO 2 , in situ DRIFTS of CO adsorption has been conducted on Ag/Ti(P25) before and after in situ photoreduction by introducing a certain amount of CO into the DRIFTS cell, because CO could be selectively coordinated with Ag(I) (2160-2170 cm -1 ) and Ag(0) (2020-2060 cm -1 ) at different positions 32,33.As shown in Fig. 7 and two weak peaks at 2069 and 2024 cm -1 for Ag(0)-CO 32,33.This observation indicated that the surface of Ag(I)/Ti(P25) was rich in Ag(I) species with minor Ag(0).For Ag(0)/Ti(P25) (after in situ photoreduction), the Ag(I)-CO peak at 2161 cm -1 significantly decreased.Meanwhile, a strong peak of Ag(0)-CO at 2024 cm -1 was observed, suggesting that Ag(0) dominated the photoreduced surface.The IR spectra changes after photoreduction indicate that the majority, but not all, of the Ag(I) was photoreduced to Ag(0).The transformation of Ag(I) to Ag(0) observed from the IR analysis agrees with the results from the analyses of UV-vis spectroscopy and the physical appearances of the samples. For the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with the water/methanol vapor mixture, CO and H 2 were found to be the major products with a minor CH 4 .Fig. 8 shows the production rates of CO, CH 4 and H 2 on the Ag(0)/Ti(A) as a function of time from one measurement.After 2 h, the production rates of CO, CH 4 and H 2 reached their maximum and steady state at 145, 5 and 1560 mol g -1 h -1 , respectively.Similar trends in production rates were also observed for Ag(0)/Ti(AB), Ag(0)/Ti(BA), and Ag(0)/Ti(P25) samples (data not shown here).Fig. 9 compares the steady-state H 2 , CO and CH 4 production rates on the various Ag(0)/Ti(M) (M A, AB, BA, P25) samples (three runs for each sample; error bars representing standard deviations).The experimental errors for the production rates of CO, CH 4 and H 2 are in the range of 5-15 (except for H 2 production over the Ag(0)/Ti(A) sample, which is 38), which are within reasonable experimental uncertainties and indicate good reproducibility of the activity measurements.The CO production rate was comparable for Ag(0)/Ti(A) and Ag(0)/Ti(AB), and it was nearly twice as high as that of Ag(0)/Ti(BA) or Ag(0)/Ti(P25).For the CH 4 and H 2 production rates, the activities of the four samples were in the order of Ag(0)/Ti(AB) Ag(0)/Ti(A) Ag(0)/Ti(BA) Ag(0)/Ti(P25).This finding demonstrates that the Ag(0)-coupled anatase-rich bicrystalline TiO 2 anatase/brookite is a promising catalyst toward the production of solar fuels from the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O.The finding that Ag(0)/Ti(AB) is more active than Ag(0)/Ti(A) is of great importance, since Ag(0)/Ti(AB) has a smaller surface area and a slightly larger band gap than Ag(0)/Ti(A) (see Table 1).The correlations of the TiO 2 crystal sizes (Table 1) with the photocatalytic activity data (Fig. 9) suggest the crystal size does not play a significant role in differentiating the activities of Ag(0)/Ti(A) and Ag(0)/Ti(AB).Even though the brookite crystal size is larger than that of anatase, the Ag(0)/Ti(AB) activity is still higher than that of Ag(0)/Ti(A).A most likely reason for this improved activity of Ag(0)/Ti(AB) is the enhanced interfacial electron transfer between anatase and brookite nanocrystals in Ag(0)/Ti(AB).The conduction band (CB) edge of brookite was about 0.14 eV more negative than that of anatase 24,25,35, which would induce transfer of the photoexcited electrons from brookite to anatase 28.In addition, Schottky barriers formed by the metal/semiconductor contact may exist at three interfaces of Ag(0)/Ti(AB), i.e., Ag(0)-anatase, Ag(0)-brookite, and Ag(0)-anatase/brookite heterojunctions.The Ag(0)-anatase/brookite interfaces may be more efficient in facilitating the electron migration from the TiO 2 to the Ag(0) sites.Hence, the combinational benefits from the electron transfer between the two phases and the Schottky barriers at the Ag(0)-anatase/brookite interfaces could have caused the higher activity of Ag(0)/Ti(AB) than Ag(0)/Ti(A).The higher activity of Ag(0)/Ti(AB) than Ag(0)/Ti(BA) was possibly because of the smaller surface area, the larger fraction of brookite that has a larger crystal size than anatase, and the larger band gap of Ag/Ti(BA) (see Table 1).There should be an optimum ratio of anatase/brookite, which depends on the photocatalytic activity of individual anatase and brookite phases, as well as the charge transfer between their interfaces.This study clearly indicates that anatase-rich A/B is more active than brookite-rich A/B; quantitative determination of this optimum ratio will be investigated in our future study.Another important finding is that Ag(0)/Ti(AB) is much more active than Ag(0)/Ti(P25).This finding indicates that the coupling of brookite to anatase is more effective than the coupling of rutile to anatase, likely because of a faster charge recombination rate within rutile crystals than within brookite 22,23 and less reduction ability of rutile due to the lower CB potential of rutile than brookite 27.The smallest surface area and the largest crystal size of Ag/Ti(P25) (see Table 1) may also contribute to its lowest photocatalytic activity. Besides the crystal phase effect of TiO 2 , the photocatalytic activities of Ag/TiO 2 were also affected by the Ag valence state.Fig. 10 compares the production rates of CO, CH 4 , and H 2 on the Ag(I)/Ti(AB)-SP and Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-SP.The production rates of CO were comparable on the Ag(I)/Ti(AB)-SP and Ag(I)/Ti(AB)-SP, but a fourfold and twofold enhancement was observed on Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-SP for the production rate of CH 4 and H 2 , respectively.This result demonstrated that Ag(0) obtained by the in situ photoreducion pretreatment played a more important role than Ag(I) for CO 2 reduction and H 2 O splitting.Ag(I) can act as an electron trapper to inhibit the charge recombination 16,18.However, the high reduction potential of Ag(I)/Ag(0) (0.8 eV) induces a strong interaction of Ag(I) with the trapped electrons.As indicated in the literature 18,36, this interaction could lead to a partial reduction of Ag(I) to Ag(0), consuming electrons rather than facilitating the trapped electrons to migrate to the surface-adsorbed CO 2 and H 2 O.This limitation hence lowers the photocatalytic performance of Ag(I)/Ti(AB)-SP.By contrast, Ag(0) serves as a sink to accumulate photogenerated electrons via the Schottky barrier at the Ag(0)-TiO 2 interface 5,9,10,17.As a result, more electrons are available on the Ag(0) sites, which promote the H 2 production from H 2 O splitting and the multi-electron process for CH 4 formation. To check the possibility of Ag(I)/TiO 2 transferring to Ag(0)/TiO 2 during the photocatalytic reaction and the repeated activity of Ag(I)/TiO 2 , the catalytic performance of Ag(I)/Ti(AB) for CO, CH 4 and H 2 production was conducted for three continuous UV on/off cycles.In each cycle, the UV light was turned on for 45 min and then turned off while the reactor was purged until no products were detected by the GC.The UV illumination time, 45 min, was consistent with the time spent during in situ photoreduction of catalysts with He H 2 O/CH 3 OH for preparing the Ag(0)/TiO 2 .Fig. S3 in Supporting Information shows the production rates of CO, CH 4 , and H 2 during the three-cycle process.The activity results demonstrated that the overall CO 2 photoreduction rate was increased over three cycles, most likely because of the transformation of Ag(I) to Ag(0).The three-cycle testing result again verifies our previous conclusion that Ag(0) species is more active than Ag(I) in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 by Ag/TiO 2 . To evaluate the significance of Ag(0) generated from the sequential spray pyrolysis and the in situ photoreduction treatment (SP method), two additional samples, prepared from PD and WI methods, were used as controls.Fig. 10 compares the activities of Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-SP, Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-PD and Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-WI.The maximum CO production rate of Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-SP was slightly higher than that of Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-PD, while its CH 4 and H 2 production rates were 9 and 3 times higher than that of Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-PD.The inferior activity of Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-PD likely resulted from its lower fraction of surface Ag(0).As supported by the UV-vis spectra of Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-PD (data not shown here), only a very weak SPR band for Ag(0) was observed, indicating a very small amount of Ag(0) on the catalyst surface.This result reasonably demonstrated that a high fraction of Ag(0) cannot be obtained by the ex situ photodeposition method in an air environment, while the in situ photoreduction treatment could avoid the partial oxidation of Ag(0) back to Ag(I).In addition, the CO, CH 4 and H 2 production rates of Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-SP were 7, 10 and 22 times higher than those of Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-WI.In agreement with our previous work 5, the result in this work again demonstrated the advantages of the spray pyrolysis process over the conventional wet-impregnation process by dispersing the Ag nanoparticles more uniformly on the TiO 2 surface. From all the photocatalytic activity results obtained (Figs. 9 and 10), one can see that the production rate of CH 4 was generally one order of magnitude lower than that of CO, while the production rate of H 2 was one order of magnitude higher than that of CO.The low CH 4 production from CO 2 photoreduction may be due to the following two reasons.First, an eight-electron transfer process to generate CH 4 is more difficult to proceed than a two-electron process to generate CO 5,10.Second, the CH 4 formation rate may be limited by that of CO, since CO may be the precursor for CH 4 generation 37.Possible reasons for the higher H 2 production from H 2 O splitting than CO and CH 4 from CO 2 photoreduction are: (1) the reduction potential of CO 2 /CO (-0.53 V at pH 7 vs.NHE) is more negative than that of H 2 O/H 2 (-0.41 V at pH 7 vs.NHE), making it easier to produce H 2 1,3,4; (2) the Ag(0) cocatalyst on TiO 2 facilitates H 2 production to a larger extent than it facilitates CO and CH 4 production. To evaluate the carbon source of CO and CH 4 , a control experiment was conducted on Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-SP with an introduction of helium (instead of CO 2 ) H 2 O/CH 3 OH vapor.In this control experiment, the production rates of CO and CH 4 were reduced by nearly 3 and 10 times compared with those using CO 2 as the feed gas.This result proved that CO and CH 4 were primarily derived from CO 2 and to a much less extent derived from CH 3 OH."}, {"llm generation": "Ag(0)-coupled anatase-rich bicrystalline TiO 2 anatase/brookite", "source": "This finding demonstrates that the Ag(0)-coupled anatase-rich bicrystalline TiO 2 anatase/brookite is a promising catalyst toward the production of solar fuels from the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O.", "context": "The crystal structure of the Ag(I)/TiO 2 and Ag(0)/TiO 2 composites was examined by XRD, as shown in Fig. 1.For Ag(I)/Ti(A), all the diffraction peaks were indexed to the pure anatase phase (JCPDS No. 21-1272).For Ag(I)/Ti(AB), the patterns indicated an anatase-rich mixture of TiO 2 anatase and brookite, the compositions of which were approximately 92 anatase and 8 brookite calculated by a Rietveld refinement method.The brookite phase (JCPDS No. 29-1360) was clearly discernible in the sample of Ag(I)/Ti(BA), from its unique (1 2 1), (2 2 1), and (0 3 2) diffraction peaks at 30.81, 42.34, 46.07 (2A).This brookite-rich Ag(I)/Ti(BA) had about 70 brookite and 30 anatase.Independent batches of the TiO 2 samples were prepared and the results from the XRD and Rietveld refinement showed a less than 3 error in the brookite fraction for a certain sample, indicating good reproducibility of the catalyst preparation.This result also agrees with the literature that bicrystalline TiO 2 anatase/brookite with controllable phases could be accurately fabricated by adjusting the hydrothermal environment 24,28.In agreement with the bulk phase analysis of XRD, the results from Raman spectroscopy (a very sensitive tool to approach the surface region of a solid sample) qualitatively indicated that the surface of Ag(I)/Ti(AB) was anatase-rich with a minor brookite, while the Ag(I)/Ti(BA) surface was rich in brookite phase (see Fig. S1 in Supporting Information).The crystal size of anatase and brookite phases for Ag(I)/TiO 2 was calculated and listed in Table 1.Ag(I)/Ti(A), Ag(I)/Ti(AB), and Ag(I)/Ti(BA) have a comparable crystal size of the anatase phase around 7 nm, smaller than that of Ag(I)/Ti(P25) (around 18 nm).The crystal size of the brookite phase in Ag(I)/Ti(BA) and Ag(I)/Ti(AB) is about 13 and 16 nm, respectively, and both are larger than the crystal size of anatase.It was noted that no diffraction lines of Ag species (metallic silver or silver oxides) were observed on the three untreated samples, suggesting that Ag species were well dispersed or the Ag particle size was very small 5,17.For Ag(0)/TiO 2 samples, the crystal structures and crystal sizes are same as Ag(I)/TiO 2 samples.Ag(0)/Ti(BA) remained in the original brookite-rich phase, and no metallic Ag(0) crystals were detected.The possible reason was that at a extremely low loading level (see the EDX results), Ag(0) was highly dispersed and this low concentration was likely below the detection limit of XRD. The morphology and textural properties of the Ag(I)/TiO 2 composites were analyzed by SEM and N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms.Fig. 2 shows the SEM images of Ag(I)/TiO 2 .The low magnification SEM images in Fig. 2a-c showed that the three samples were microspheres from submicrometer to micrometer size range.The high magnification SEM images in Fig. 2d-f showed a porous structure for all these microspheres, which were agglomerated ensembles of nanoparticles.The literature 24,29 and our previous studies 14,20 demonstrated that anatase TiO 2 had very fine particles in the size range of 8-10 nm.The anatase-rich TiO 2 aggregates of particles were in the size range of 50 nm, while the brookite-rich TiO 2 was made up of rod-like particles with diameters up to 50 nm and lengths up to 100 nm.The present SEM micrographs of Ag(I)/Ti(A), Ag(I)/Ti(AB) and Ag(I)/Ti(BA) in Fig. 2d-f well agree with the literature observations.For the in situ photoreduced Ag(0)/TiO 2 , their morphologies and particle sizes remained the same as the Ag(I)/TiO 2 . The distribution of Ag, Ti and O elements in the Ag(I)/TiO 2 and Ag(0)/TiO 2 was analyzed by X-ray elemental mapping, and the images are shown in Fig. 3.For all three samples, Ag(I)/Ti(AB), Ag(I)/Ti(BA), and Ag(0)/Ti(BA), the elemental mapping demonstrated that Ag species (green color) were highly dispersed on the The band gap, crystal size of anatase (A) and brookite (B) phase, BET surface area, BJH pore size, and BJH pore volume of these as-prepared (untreated) Ag/TiO2 catalysts.

The T-plots fitting results suggested that there were no micropores in the three porous microspheres of Ag(I)/TiO 2 (see Fig. S2 in Supporting Information).Table 1 compares the BET surface area, pore size and pore volume of the Ag(I)/TiO 2 composites.Ag(I)/Ti(A) had the largest BET surface area (188 m 2 g -1 ), nearly 3.5 times as high as Ag(I)/Ti(P25).Ag(I)/Ti(AB) has a slightly lower surface area than Ag(I)/Ti(A), but is higher than Ag(I)/Ti(BA).This difference in the surface area probably resulted from the increasing content of brookite.However, the pore sizes and volumes of the Ag(I)/Ti(A), Ag(I)/Ti(AB) and Ag(I)/Ti(BA) were comparable (around 5 nm and 0.2 cm 3 g -1 , respectively), much smaller than that of Ag(I)/Ti(P25).The higher surface area but smaller pore size of Ag(I)/Ti(A) compared with Ag(I)/Ti(P25) was probably due to the smaller size of anatase particles (8-10 nm) than P25 particles (20-25 nm) 11,28. Diffuse reflectance UV-vis spectra were recorded for the Ag/TiO 2 samples before and after the in situ photoreduction treatment, as shown in Fig. 5.For the untreated Ag(I)/TiO 2 (Fig. 5a), the absorption with an onset at around 380 nm was due to the band gap transition of TiO 2 .There was no surface plasma resonance (SPR) band around 400-500 nm for the Ag(0) particles.The absence of an SPR signal indirectly suggested the existence of Ag(I) on the as-prepared catalyst surface 17 For the treated Ag(0)/TiO 2 composites (Fig. 5b), the absorption edges of TiO 2 did not shift.Significantly different from the Ag(I)/TiO 2 , an obvious SPR band around 400-600 nm appeared on the Ag(0)/Ti(A), Ag(0)/Ti(AB), Ag(0)/Ti(BA) and Ag(0)/Ti(P25).This unique SPR peak reveals the reduction of Ag(I) into Ag(0) by photo-illumination in the presence of H 2 O/CH 3 OH vapor.Table 1 compares the band gaps of the as-prepared Ag(I)/TiO 2 composites derived from the UV-vis spectra in Fig. 5.With the increase of brookite content, the band gaps of Ag(I)/Ti(A), Ag(I)/Ti(AB) and Ag(I)/Ti(BA) slightly increased from 3.23 to 3.26 and 3.31 eV.It was noted that treatment did not narrow or enlarge the band gaps of the Ag(0)/TiO 2 , probably because Ag species were dispersed on the surface but not doped into the lattice of TiO 2 15.The reduction of Ag(I) to Ag(0) was also supported by the physical appearance of the catalysts.As shown in Fig. 6, the in situ photoreduction treatment induced the color change from initial dark gray to brownish or reddish gray.This color transformation was in agreement with the study by Kawahara et al. 30 that the reduction of Ag(I) to Ag(0) by UV light irradiation resulted in the appearance of a brownish gray color in the Ag-TiO 2 nanocomposite films.Krejcikova et al. 17 also found that Ag(0) was not present in the as-prepared Ag/TiO 2 at a low concentration (2 wt.), while the presence of metallic Ag(0) induced the color change from dark to yellow.The UV-vis spectra and the color change suggest that the untreated surfaces were dominated by Ag(I) and the treated surfaces were covered with the majority of Ag(0).The method of using CO as a smart IR probing molecule is often applied to identify the oxidation state of metals (e.g., Cu, Ag, Rh) 11,31323334.To confirm whether all the Ag(I) species are transformed into Ag(0) after photoinduced reduction of Ag(I)/TiO 2 , in situ DRIFTS of CO adsorption has been conducted on Ag/Ti(P25) before and after in situ photoreduction by introducing a certain amount of CO into the DRIFTS cell, because CO could be selectively coordinated with Ag(I) (2160-2170 cm -1 ) and Ag(0) (2020-2060 cm -1 ) at different positions 32,33.As shown in Fig. 7 and two weak peaks at 2069 and 2024 cm -1 for Ag(0)-CO 32,33.This observation indicated that the surface of Ag(I)/Ti(P25) was rich in Ag(I) species with minor Ag(0).For Ag(0)/Ti(P25) (after in situ photoreduction), the Ag(I)-CO peak at 2161 cm -1 significantly decreased.Meanwhile, a strong peak of Ag(0)-CO at 2024 cm -1 was observed, suggesting that Ag(0) dominated the photoreduced surface.The IR spectra changes after photoreduction indicate that the majority, but not all, of the Ag(I) was photoreduced to Ag(0).The transformation of Ag(I) to Ag(0) observed from the IR analysis agrees with the results from the analyses of UV-vis spectroscopy and the physical appearances of the samples. For the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with the water/methanol vapor mixture, CO and H 2 were found to be the major products with a minor CH 4 .Fig. 8 shows the production rates of CO, CH 4 and H 2 on the Ag(0)/Ti(A) as a function of time from one measurement.After 2 h, the production rates of CO, CH 4 and H 2 reached their maximum and steady state at 145, 5 and 1560 mol g -1 h -1 , respectively.Similar trends in production rates were also observed for Ag(0)/Ti(AB), Ag(0)/Ti(BA), and Ag(0)/Ti(P25) samples (data not shown here).Fig. 9 compares the steady-state H 2 , CO and CH 4 production rates on the various Ag(0)/Ti(M) (M A, AB, BA, P25) samples (three runs for each sample; error bars representing standard deviations).The experimental errors for the production rates of CO, CH 4 and H 2 are in the range of 5-15 (except for H 2 production over the Ag(0)/Ti(A) sample, which is 38), which are within reasonable experimental uncertainties and indicate good reproducibility of the activity measurements.The CO production rate was comparable for Ag(0)/Ti(A) and Ag(0)/Ti(AB), and it was nearly twice as high as that of Ag(0)/Ti(BA) or Ag(0)/Ti(P25).For the CH 4 and H 2 production rates, the activities of the four samples were in the order of Ag(0)/Ti(AB) Ag(0)/Ti(A) Ag(0)/Ti(BA) Ag(0)/Ti(P25).This finding demonstrates that the Ag(0)-coupled anatase-rich bicrystalline TiO 2 anatase/brookite is a promising catalyst toward the production of solar fuels from the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O.The finding that Ag(0)/Ti(AB) is more active than Ag(0)/Ti(A) is of great importance, since Ag(0)/Ti(AB) has a smaller surface area and a slightly larger band gap than Ag(0)/Ti(A) (see Table 1).The correlations of the TiO 2 crystal sizes (Table 1) with the photocatalytic activity data (Fig. 9) suggest the crystal size does not play a significant role in differentiating the activities of Ag(0)/Ti(A) and Ag(0)/Ti(AB).Even though the brookite crystal size is larger than that of anatase, the Ag(0)/Ti(AB) activity is still higher than that of Ag(0)/Ti(A).A most likely reason for this improved activity of Ag(0)/Ti(AB) is the enhanced interfacial electron transfer between anatase and brookite nanocrystals in Ag(0)/Ti(AB).The conduction band (CB) edge of brookite was about 0.14 eV more negative than that of anatase 24,25,35, which would induce transfer of the photoexcited electrons from brookite to anatase 28.In addition, Schottky barriers formed by the metal/semiconductor contact may exist at three interfaces of Ag(0)/Ti(AB), i.e., Ag(0)-anatase, Ag(0)-brookite, and Ag(0)-anatase/brookite heterojunctions.The Ag(0)-anatase/brookite interfaces may be more efficient in facilitating the electron migration from the TiO 2 to the Ag(0) sites.Hence, the combinational benefits from the electron transfer between the two phases and the Schottky barriers at the Ag(0)-anatase/brookite interfaces could have caused the higher activity of Ag(0)/Ti(AB) than Ag(0)/Ti(A).The higher activity of Ag(0)/Ti(AB) than Ag(0)/Ti(BA) was possibly because of the smaller surface area, the larger fraction of brookite that has a larger crystal size than anatase, and the larger band gap of Ag/Ti(BA) (see Table 1).There should be an optimum ratio of anatase/brookite, which depends on the photocatalytic activity of individual anatase and brookite phases, as well as the charge transfer between their interfaces.This study clearly indicates that anatase-rich A/B is more active than brookite-rich A/B; quantitative determination of this optimum ratio will be investigated in our future study.Another important finding is that Ag(0)/Ti(AB) is much more active than Ag(0)/Ti(P25).This finding indicates that the coupling of brookite to anatase is more effective than the coupling of rutile to anatase, likely because of a faster charge recombination rate within rutile crystals than within brookite 22,23 and less reduction ability of rutile due to the lower CB potential of rutile than brookite 27.The smallest surface area and the largest crystal size of Ag/Ti(P25) (see Table 1) may also contribute to its lowest photocatalytic activity. Besides the crystal phase effect of TiO 2 , the photocatalytic activities of Ag/TiO 2 were also affected by the Ag valence state.Fig. 10 compares the production rates of CO, CH 4 , and H 2 on the Ag(I)/Ti(AB)-SP and Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-SP.The production rates of CO were comparable on the Ag(I)/Ti(AB)-SP and Ag(I)/Ti(AB)-SP, but a fourfold and twofold enhancement was observed on Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-SP for the production rate of CH 4 and H 2 , respectively.This result demonstrated that Ag(0) obtained by the in situ photoreducion pretreatment played a more important role than Ag(I) for CO 2 reduction and H 2 O splitting.Ag(I) can act as an electron trapper to inhibit the charge recombination 16,18.However, the high reduction potential of Ag(I)/Ag(0) (0.8 eV) induces a strong interaction of Ag(I) with the trapped electrons.As indicated in the literature 18,36, this interaction could lead to a partial reduction of Ag(I) to Ag(0), consuming electrons rather than facilitating the trapped electrons to migrate to the surface-adsorbed CO 2 and H 2 O.This limitation hence lowers the photocatalytic performance of Ag(I)/Ti(AB)-SP.By contrast, Ag(0) serves as a sink to accumulate photogenerated electrons via the Schottky barrier at the Ag(0)-TiO 2 interface 5,9,10,17.As a result, more electrons are available on the Ag(0) sites, which promote the H 2 production from H 2 O splitting and the multi-electron process for CH 4 formation. To check the possibility of Ag(I)/TiO 2 transferring to Ag(0)/TiO 2 during the photocatalytic reaction and the repeated activity of Ag(I)/TiO 2 , the catalytic performance of Ag(I)/Ti(AB) for CO, CH 4 and H 2 production was conducted for three continuous UV on/off cycles.In each cycle, the UV light was turned on for 45 min and then turned off while the reactor was purged until no products were detected by the GC.The UV illumination time, 45 min, was consistent with the time spent during in situ photoreduction of catalysts with He H 2 O/CH 3 OH for preparing the Ag(0)/TiO 2 .Fig. S3 in Supporting Information shows the production rates of CO, CH 4 , and H 2 during the three-cycle process.The activity results demonstrated that the overall CO 2 photoreduction rate was increased over three cycles, most likely because of the transformation of Ag(I) to Ag(0).The three-cycle testing result again verifies our previous conclusion that Ag(0) species is more active than Ag(I) in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 by Ag/TiO 2 . To evaluate the significance of Ag(0) generated from the sequential spray pyrolysis and the in situ photoreduction treatment (SP method), two additional samples, prepared from PD and WI methods, were used as controls.Fig. 10 compares the activities of Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-SP, Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-PD and Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-WI.The maximum CO production rate of Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-SP was slightly higher than that of Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-PD, while its CH 4 and H 2 production rates were 9 and 3 times higher than that of Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-PD.The inferior activity of Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-PD likely resulted from its lower fraction of surface Ag(0).As supported by the UV-vis spectra of Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-PD (data not shown here), only a very weak SPR band for Ag(0) was observed, indicating a very small amount of Ag(0) on the catalyst surface.This result reasonably demonstrated that a high fraction of Ag(0) cannot be obtained by the ex situ photodeposition method in an air environment, while the in situ photoreduction treatment could avoid the partial oxidation of Ag(0) back to Ag(I).In addition, the CO, CH 4 and H 2 production rates of Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-SP were 7, 10 and 22 times higher than those of Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-WI.In agreement with our previous work 5, the result in this work again demonstrated the advantages of the spray pyrolysis process over the conventional wet-impregnation process by dispersing the Ag nanoparticles more uniformly on the TiO 2 surface. From all the photocatalytic activity results obtained (Figs. 9 and 10), one can see that the production rate of CH 4 was generally one order of magnitude lower than that of CO, while the production rate of H 2 was one order of magnitude higher than that of CO.The low CH 4 production from CO 2 photoreduction may be due to the following two reasons.First, an eight-electron transfer process to generate CH 4 is more difficult to proceed than a two-electron process to generate CO 5,10.Second, the CH 4 formation rate may be limited by that of CO, since CO may be the precursor for CH 4 generation 37.Possible reasons for the higher H 2 production from H 2 O splitting than CO and CH 4 from CO 2 photoreduction are: (1) the reduction potential of CO 2 /CO (-0.53 V at pH 7 vs.NHE) is more negative than that of H 2 O/H 2 (-0.41 V at pH 7 vs.NHE), making it easier to produce H 2 1,3,4; (2) the Ag(0) cocatalyst on TiO 2 facilitates H 2 production to a larger extent than it facilitates CO and CH 4 production. To evaluate the carbon source of CO and CH 4 , a control experiment was conducted on Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-SP with an introduction of helium (instead of CO 2 ) H 2 O/CH 3 OH vapor.In this control experiment, the production rates of CO and CH 4 were reduced by nearly 3 and 10 times compared with those using CO 2 as the feed gas.This result proved that CO and CH 4 were primarily derived from CO 2 and to a much less extent derived from CH 3 OH."}, {"llm generation": "catalyst surface", "source": "As supported by the UV-vis spectra of Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-PD (data not shown here), only a very weak SPR band for Ag(0) was observed, indicating a very small amount of Ag(0) on the catalyst surface.", "context": "The crystal structure of the Ag(I)/TiO 2 and Ag(0)/TiO 2 composites was examined by XRD, as shown in Fig. 1.For Ag(I)/Ti(A), all the diffraction peaks were indexed to the pure anatase phase (JCPDS No. 21-1272).For Ag(I)/Ti(AB), the patterns indicated an anatase-rich mixture of TiO 2 anatase and brookite, the compositions of which were approximately 92 anatase and 8 brookite calculated by a Rietveld refinement method.The brookite phase (JCPDS No. 29-1360) was clearly discernible in the sample of Ag(I)/Ti(BA), from its unique (1 2 1), (2 2 1), and (0 3 2) diffraction peaks at 30.81, 42.34, 46.07 (2A).This brookite-rich Ag(I)/Ti(BA) had about 70 brookite and 30 anatase.Independent batches of the TiO 2 samples were prepared and the results from the XRD and Rietveld refinement showed a less than 3 error in the brookite fraction for a certain sample, indicating good reproducibility of the catalyst preparation.This result also agrees with the literature that bicrystalline TiO 2 anatase/brookite with controllable phases could be accurately fabricated by adjusting the hydrothermal environment 24,28.In agreement with the bulk phase analysis of XRD, the results from Raman spectroscopy (a very sensitive tool to approach the surface region of a solid sample) qualitatively indicated that the surface of Ag(I)/Ti(AB) was anatase-rich with a minor brookite, while the Ag(I)/Ti(BA) surface was rich in brookite phase (see Fig. S1 in Supporting Information).The crystal size of anatase and brookite phases for Ag(I)/TiO 2 was calculated and listed in Table 1.Ag(I)/Ti(A), Ag(I)/Ti(AB), and Ag(I)/Ti(BA) have a comparable crystal size of the anatase phase around 7 nm, smaller than that of Ag(I)/Ti(P25) (around 18 nm).The crystal size of the brookite phase in Ag(I)/Ti(BA) and Ag(I)/Ti(AB) is about 13 and 16 nm, respectively, and both are larger than the crystal size of anatase.It was noted that no diffraction lines of Ag species (metallic silver or silver oxides) were observed on the three untreated samples, suggesting that Ag species were well dispersed or the Ag particle size was very small 5,17.For Ag(0)/TiO 2 samples, the crystal structures and crystal sizes are same as Ag(I)/TiO 2 samples.Ag(0)/Ti(BA) remained in the original brookite-rich phase, and no metallic Ag(0) crystals were detected.The possible reason was that at a extremely low loading level (see the EDX results), Ag(0) was highly dispersed and this low concentration was likely below the detection limit of XRD. The morphology and textural properties of the Ag(I)/TiO 2 composites were analyzed by SEM and N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms.Fig. 2 shows the SEM images of Ag(I)/TiO 2 .The low magnification SEM images in Fig. 2a-c showed that the three samples were microspheres from submicrometer to micrometer size range.The high magnification SEM images in Fig. 2d-f showed a porous structure for all these microspheres, which were agglomerated ensembles of nanoparticles.The literature 24,29 and our previous studies 14,20 demonstrated that anatase TiO 2 had very fine particles in the size range of 8-10 nm.The anatase-rich TiO 2 aggregates of particles were in the size range of 50 nm, while the brookite-rich TiO 2 was made up of rod-like particles with diameters up to 50 nm and lengths up to 100 nm.The present SEM micrographs of Ag(I)/Ti(A), Ag(I)/Ti(AB) and Ag(I)/Ti(BA) in Fig. 2d-f well agree with the literature observations.For the in situ photoreduced Ag(0)/TiO 2 , their morphologies and particle sizes remained the same as the Ag(I)/TiO 2 . The distribution of Ag, Ti and O elements in the Ag(I)/TiO 2 and Ag(0)/TiO 2 was analyzed by X-ray elemental mapping, and the images are shown in Fig. 3.For all three samples, Ag(I)/Ti(AB), Ag(I)/Ti(BA), and Ag(0)/Ti(BA), the elemental mapping demonstrated that Ag species (green color) were highly dispersed on the The band gap, crystal size of anatase (A) and brookite (B) phase, BET surface area, BJH pore size, and BJH pore volume of these as-prepared (untreated) Ag/TiO2 catalysts. Band gap (eV) Crystal size of A (nm) Crystal size of B (nm) BET surface area (m 2 g -1 ) BJH pore size (nm) BJH pore volume (cm 3 g -1 ) Ag(I)/Ti(A) 3.23 three samples displayed a type IV isotherm with H 2 type hysteresis, which were the characteristics of mesoporous solids 17.This result again confirmed the mesoporous structure of Ag/TiO 2 as indicated by the SEM images in Fig. 2. The T-plots fitting results suggested that there were no micropores in the three porous microspheres of Ag(I)/TiO 2 (see Fig. S2 in Supporting Information).Table 1 compares the BET surface area, pore size and pore volume of the Ag(I)/TiO 2 composites.Ag(I)/Ti(A) had the largest BET surface area (188 m 2 g -1 ), nearly 3.5 times as high as Ag(I)/Ti(P25).Ag(I)/Ti(AB) has a slightly lower surface area than Ag(I)/Ti(A), but is higher than Ag(I)/Ti(BA).This difference in the surface area probably resulted from the increasing content of brookite.However, the pore sizes and volumes of the Ag(I)/Ti(A), Ag(I)/Ti(AB) and Ag(I)/Ti(BA) were comparable (around 5 nm and 0.2 cm 3 g -1 , respectively), much smaller than that of Ag(I)/Ti(P25).The higher surface area but smaller pore size of Ag(I)/Ti(A) compared with Ag(I)/Ti(P25) was probably due to the smaller size of anatase particles (8-10 nm) than P25 particles (20-25 nm) 11,28. Diffuse reflectance UV-vis spectra were recorded for the Ag/TiO 2 samples before and after the in situ photoreduction treatment, as shown in Fig. 5.For the untreated Ag(I)/TiO 2 (Fig. 5a), the absorption with an onset at around 380 nm was due to the band gap transition of TiO 2 .There was no surface plasma resonance (SPR) band around 400-500 nm for the Ag(0) particles.The absence of an SPR signal indirectly suggested the existence of Ag(I) on the as-prepared catalyst surface 17 For the treated Ag(0)/TiO 2 composites (Fig. 5b), the absorption edges of TiO 2 did not shift.Significantly different from the Ag(I)/TiO 2 , an obvious SPR band around 400-600 nm appeared on the Ag(0)/Ti(A), Ag(0)/Ti(AB), Ag(0)/Ti(BA) and Ag(0)/Ti(P25).This unique SPR peak reveals the reduction of Ag(I) into Ag(0) by photo-illumination in the presence of H 2 O/CH 3 OH vapor.Table 1 compares the band gaps of the as-prepared Ag(I)/TiO 2 composites derived from the UV-vis spectra in Fig. 5.With the increase of brookite content, the band gaps of Ag(I)/Ti(A), Ag(I)/Ti(AB) and Ag(I)/Ti(BA) slightly increased from 3.23 to 3.26 and 3.31 eV.It was noted that treatment did not narrow or enlarge the band gaps of the Ag(0)/TiO 2 , probably because Ag species were dispersed on the surface but not doped into the lattice of TiO 2 15.The reduction of Ag(I) to Ag(0) was also supported by the physical appearance of the catalysts.As shown in Fig. 6, the in situ photoreduction treatment induced the color change from initial dark gray to brownish or reddish gray.This color transformation was in agreement with the study by Kawahara et al. 30 that the reduction of Ag(I) to Ag(0) by UV light irradiation resulted in the appearance of a brownish gray color in the Ag-TiO 2 nanocomposite films.Krejcikova et al. 17 also found that Ag(0) was not present in the as-prepared Ag/TiO 2 at a low concentration (2 wt.), while the presence of metallic Ag(0) induced the color change from dark to yellow.The UV-vis spectra and the color change suggest that the untreated surfaces were dominated by Ag(I) and the treated surfaces were covered with the majority of Ag(0).The method of using CO as a smart IR probing molecule is often applied to identify the oxidation state of metals (e.g., Cu, Ag, Rh) 11,31323334.To confirm whether all the Ag(I) species are transformed into Ag(0) after photoinduced reduction of Ag(I)/TiO 2 , in situ DRIFTS of CO adsorption has been conducted on Ag/Ti(P25) before and after in situ photoreduction by introducing a certain amount of CO into the DRIFTS cell, because CO could be selectively coordinated with Ag(I) (2160-2170 cm -1 ) and Ag(0) (2020-2060 cm -1 ) at different positions 32,33.As shown in Fig. 7 and two weak peaks at 2069 and 2024 cm -1 for Ag(0)-CO 32,33.This observation indicated that the surface of Ag(I)/Ti(P25) was rich in Ag(I) species with minor Ag(0).For Ag(0)/Ti(P25) (after in situ photoreduction), the Ag(I)-CO peak at 2161 cm -1 significantly decreased.Meanwhile, a strong peak of Ag(0)-CO at 2024 cm -1 was observed, suggesting that Ag(0) dominated the photoreduced surface.The IR spectra changes after photoreduction indicate that the majority, but not all, of the Ag(I) was photoreduced to Ag(0).The transformation of Ag(I) to Ag(0) observed from the IR analysis agrees with the results from the analyses of UV-vis spectroscopy and the physical appearances of the samples. For the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with the water/methanol vapor mixture, CO and H 2 were found to be the major products with a minor CH 4 .Fig. 8 shows the production rates of CO, CH 4 and H 2 on the Ag(0)/Ti(A) as a function of time from one measurement.After 2 h, the production rates of CO, CH 4 and H 2 reached their maximum and steady state at 145, 5 and 1560 mol g -1 h -1 , respectively.Similar trends in production rates were also observed for Ag(0)/Ti(AB), Ag(0)/Ti(BA), and Ag(0)/Ti(P25) samples (data not shown here).Fig. 9 compares the steady-state H 2 , CO and CH 4 production rates on the various Ag(0)/Ti(M) (M A, AB, BA, P25) samples (three runs for each sample; error bars representing standard deviations).The experimental errors for the production rates of CO, CH 4 and H 2 are in the range of 5-15 (except for H 2 production over the Ag(0)/Ti(A) sample, which is 38), which are within reasonable experimental uncertainties and indicate good reproducibility of the activity measurements.The CO production rate was comparable for Ag(0)/Ti(A) and Ag(0)/Ti(AB), and it was nearly twice as high as that of Ag(0)/Ti(BA) or Ag(0)/Ti(P25).For the CH 4 and H 2 production rates, the activities of the four samples were in the order of Ag(0)/Ti(AB) Ag(0)/Ti(A) Ag(0)/Ti(BA) Ag(0)/Ti(P25).This finding demonstrates that the Ag(0)-coupled anatase-rich bicrystalline TiO 2 anatase/brookite is a promising catalyst toward the production of solar fuels from the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O.The finding that Ag(0)/Ti(AB) is more active than Ag(0)/Ti(A) is of great importance, since Ag(0)/Ti(AB) has a smaller surface area and a slightly larger band gap than Ag(0)/Ti(A) (see Table 1).The correlations of the TiO 2 crystal sizes (Table 1) with the photocatalytic activity data (Fig. 9) suggest the crystal size does not play a significant role in differentiating the activities of Ag(0)/Ti(A) and Ag(0)/Ti(AB).Even though the brookite crystal size is larger than that of anatase, the Ag(0)/Ti(AB) activity is still higher than that of Ag(0)/Ti(A).A most likely reason for this improved activity of Ag(0)/Ti(AB) is the enhanced interfacial electron transfer between anatase and brookite nanocrystals in Ag(0)/Ti(AB).The conduction band (CB) edge of brookite was about 0.14 eV more negative than that of anatase 24,25,35, which would induce transfer of the photoexcited electrons from brookite to anatase 28.In addition, Schottky barriers formed by the metal/semiconductor contact may exist at three interfaces of Ag(0)/Ti(AB), i.e., Ag(0)-anatase, Ag(0)-brookite, and Ag(0)-anatase/brookite heterojunctions.The Ag(0)-anatase/brookite interfaces may be more efficient in facilitating the electron migration from the TiO 2 to the Ag(0) sites.Hence, the combinational benefits from the electron transfer between the two phases and the Schottky barriers at the Ag(0)-anatase/brookite interfaces could have caused the higher activity of Ag(0)/Ti(AB) than Ag(0)/Ti(A).The higher activity of Ag(0)/Ti(AB) than Ag(0)/Ti(BA) was possibly because of the smaller surface area, the larger fraction of brookite that has a larger crystal size than anatase, and the larger band gap of Ag/Ti(BA) (see Table 1).There should be an optimum ratio of anatase/brookite, which depends on the photocatalytic activity of individual anatase and brookite phases, as well as the charge transfer between their interfaces.This study clearly indicates that anatase-rich A/B is more active than brookite-rich A/B; quantitative determination of this optimum ratio will be investigated in our future study.Another important finding is that Ag(0)/Ti(AB) is much more active than Ag(0)/Ti(P25).This finding indicates that the coupling of brookite to anatase is more effective than the coupling of rutile to anatase, likely because of a faster charge recombination rate within rutile crystals than within brookite 22,23 and less reduction ability of rutile due to the lower CB potential of rutile than brookite 27.The smallest surface area and the largest crystal size of Ag/Ti(P25) (see Table 1) may also contribute to its lowest photocatalytic activity. Besides the crystal phase effect of TiO 2 , the photocatalytic activities of Ag/TiO 2 were also affected by the Ag valence state.Fig. 10 compares the production rates of CO, CH 4 , and H 2 on the Ag(I)/Ti(AB)-SP and Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-SP.The production rates of CO were comparable on the Ag(I)/Ti(AB)-SP and Ag(I)/Ti(AB)-SP, but a fourfold and twofold enhancement was observed on Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-SP for the production rate of CH 4 and H 2 , respectively.This result demonstrated that Ag(0) obtained by the in situ photoreducion pretreatment played a more important role than Ag(I) for CO 2 reduction and H 2 O splitting.Ag(I) can act as an electron trapper to inhibit the charge recombination 16,18.However, the high reduction potential of Ag(I)/Ag(0) (0.8 eV) induces a strong interaction of Ag(I) with the trapped electrons.As indicated in the literature 18,36, this interaction could lead to a partial reduction of Ag(I) to Ag(0), consuming electrons rather than facilitating the trapped electrons to migrate to the surface-adsorbed CO 2 and H 2 O.This limitation hence lowers the photocatalytic performance of Ag(I)/Ti(AB)-SP.By contrast, Ag(0) serves as a sink to accumulate photogenerated electrons via the Schottky barrier at the Ag(0)-TiO 2 interface 5,9,10,17.As a result, more electrons are available on the Ag(0) sites, which promote the H 2 production from H 2 O splitting and the multi-electron process for CH 4 formation. To check the possibility of Ag(I)/TiO 2 transferring to Ag(0)/TiO 2 during the photocatalytic reaction and the repeated activity of Ag(I)/TiO 2 , the catalytic performance of Ag(I)/Ti(AB) for CO, CH 4 and H 2 production was conducted for three continuous UV on/off cycles.In each cycle, the UV light was turned on for 45 min and then turned off while the reactor was purged until no products were detected by the GC.The UV illumination time, 45 min, was consistent with the time spent during in situ photoreduction of catalysts with He H 2 O/CH 3 OH for preparing the Ag(0)/TiO 2 .Fig. S3 in Supporting Information shows the production rates of CO, CH 4 , and H 2 during the three-cycle process.The activity results demonstrated that the overall CO 2 photoreduction rate was increased over three cycles, most likely because of the transformation of Ag(I) to Ag(0).The three-cycle testing result again verifies our previous conclusion that Ag(0) species is more active than Ag(I) in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 by Ag/TiO 2 . To evaluate the significance of Ag(0) generated from the sequential spray pyrolysis and the in situ photoreduction treatment (SP method), two additional samples, prepared from PD and WI methods, were used as controls.Fig. 10 compares the activities of Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-SP, Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-PD and Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-WI.The maximum CO production rate of Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-SP was slightly higher than that of Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-PD, while its CH 4 and H 2 production rates were 9 and 3 times higher than that of Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-PD.The inferior activity of Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-PD likely resulted from its lower fraction of surface Ag(0).As supported by the UV-vis spectra of Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-PD (data not shown here), only a very weak SPR band for Ag(0) was observed, indicating a very small amount of Ag(0) on the catalyst surface.This result reasonably demonstrated that a high fraction of Ag(0) cannot be obtained by the ex situ photodeposition method in an air environment, while the in situ photoreduction treatment could avoid the partial oxidation of Ag(0) back to Ag(I).In addition, the CO, CH 4 and H 2 production rates of Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-SP were 7, 10 and 22 times higher than those of Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-WI.In agreement with our previous work 5, the result in this work again demonstrated the advantages of the spray pyrolysis process over the conventional wet-impregnation process by dispersing the Ag nanoparticles more uniformly on the TiO 2 surface. From all the photocatalytic activity results obtained (Figs. 9 and 10), one can see that the production rate of CH 4 was generally one order of magnitude lower than that of CO, while the production rate of H 2 was one order of magnitude higher than that of CO.The low CH 4 production from CO 2 photoreduction may be due to the following two reasons.First, an eight-electron transfer process to generate CH 4 is more difficult to proceed than a two-electron process to generate CO 5,10.Second, the CH 4 formation rate may be limited by that of CO, since CO may be the precursor for CH 4 generation 37.Possible reasons for the higher H 2 production from H 2 O splitting than CO and CH 4 from CO 2 photoreduction are: (1) the reduction potential of CO 2 /CO (-0.53 V at pH 7 vs.NHE) is more negative than that of H 2 O/H 2 (-0.41 V at pH 7 vs.NHE), making it easier to produce H 2 1,3,4; (2) the Ag(0) cocatalyst on TiO 2 facilitates H 2 production to a larger extent than it facilitates CO and CH 4 production. To evaluate the carbon source of CO and CH 4 , a control experiment was conducted on Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-SP with an introduction of helium (instead of CO 2 ) H 2 O/CH 3 OH vapor.In this control experiment, the production rates of CO and CH 4 were reduced by nearly 3 and 10 times compared with those using CO 2 as the feed gas.This result proved that CO and CH 4 were primarily derived from CO 2 and to a much less extent derived from CH 3 OH."}, {"llm generation": "Ag/TiO 2 composites", "source": "This work has investigated the effects of a TiO 2 crystal phase, an Ag valence, and a preparation method on the photocatalytic performance of Ag/TiO 2 composites for CO 2 photoreduction with water in the presence of methanol.", "context": "This work has investigated the effects of a TiO 2 crystal phase, an Ag valence, and a preparation method on the photocatalytic performance of Ag/TiO 2 composites for CO 2 photoreduction with water in the presence of methanol.The material property analysis and photocatalytic activity results demonstrated that anatase-rich anatase/brookite (AB) mixed-phase TiO 2 is an excellent photocatalyst that exhibited higher activity than pure anatase, a brookite-rich anatase/brookite mixture, and anatase/rutile (P25).The interfacial charge transfer between anatase and brookite is believed to play an important role to enhance the catalytic activity.Ag(0)-incorporated TiO 2 (AB) was more active than Ag(I)-incorporated TiO 2 (AB), indicating the importance of ensuring the right Ag valence on the catalyst surface.This study also presented a novel and effective method to disperse Ag(0) uniformly on the TiO 2 surface, i.e., the sequential spray pyrolysis and the in situ photoreduction process (SP method).This SP method is much superior to the conventional ex situ photodeposition (PD) and wet-impregnation (WI) process, as evidenced by one order of magnitude higher production of H 2 and CH 4 .Although this work has suggested that the interfaces between TiO 2 anatase and brookite as well as those between Ag(0) and TiO 2 are critical for enhanced CO 2 photoreduction, the exact charge transfer mechanism is not well understood.Future work is necessary to explore the mechanism in a systematic manner by applying spectroscopic analysis (such as FTIR and EPR) and correlating with material properties and photocatalytic activities.

(2) the Ag(0) cocatalyst on TiO 2 facilitates H 2 production to a larger extent than it facilitates CO and CH 4 production.", "context": "The crystal structure of the Ag(I)/TiO 2 and Ag(0)/TiO 2 composites was examined by XRD, as shown in Fig. 1.For Ag(I)/Ti(A), all the diffraction peaks were indexed to the pure anatase phase (JCPDS No. 21-1272).For Ag(I)/Ti(AB), the patterns indicated an anatase-rich mixture of TiO 2 anatase and brookite, the compositions of which were approximately 92 anatase and 8 brookite calculated by a Rietveld refinement method.The brookite phase (JCPDS No. 29-1360) was clearly discernible in the sample of Ag(I)/Ti(BA), from its unique (1 2 1), (2 2 1), and (0 3 2) diffraction peaks at 30.81, 42.34, 46.07 (2A).This brookite-rich Ag(I)/Ti(BA) had about 70 brookite and 30 anatase.Independent batches of the TiO 2 samples were prepared and the results from the XRD and Rietveld refinement showed a less than 3 error in the brookite fraction for a certain sample, indicating good reproducibility of the catalyst preparation.This result also agrees with the literature that bicrystalline TiO 2 anatase/brookite with controllable phases could be accurately fabricated by adjusting the hydrothermal environment 24,28.In agreement with the bulk phase analysis of XRD, the results from Raman spectroscopy (a very sensitive tool to approach the surface region of a solid sample) qualitatively indicated that the surface of Ag(I)/Ti(AB) was anatase-rich with a minor brookite, while the Ag(I)/Ti(BA) surface was rich in brookite phase (see Fig. S1 in Supporting Information).The crystal size of anatase and brookite phases for Ag(I)/TiO 2 was calculated and listed in Table 1.Ag(I)/Ti(A), Ag(I)/Ti(AB), and Ag(I)/Ti(BA) have a comparable crystal size of the anatase phase around 7 nm, smaller than that of Ag(I)/Ti(P25) (around 18 nm).The crystal size of the brookite phase in Ag(I)/Ti(BA) and Ag(I)/Ti(AB) is about 13 and 16 nm, respectively, and both are larger than the crystal size of anatase.It was noted that no diffraction lines of Ag species (metallic silver or silver oxides) were observed on the three untreated samples, suggesting that Ag species were well dispersed or the Ag particle size was very small 5,17.For Ag(0)/TiO 2 samples, the crystal structures and crystal sizes are same as Ag(I)/TiO 2 samples.Ag(0)/Ti(BA) remained in the original brookite-rich phase, and no metallic Ag(0) crystals were detected.The possible reason was that at a extremely low loading level (see the EDX results), Ag(0) was highly dispersed and this low concentration was likely below the detection limit of XRD. The morphology and textural properties of the Ag(I)/TiO 2 composites were analyzed by SEM and N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms.Fig. 2 shows the SEM images of Ag(I)/TiO 2 .The low magnification SEM images in Fig. 2a-c showed that the three samples were microspheres from submicrometer to micrometer size range.The high magnification SEM images in Fig. 2d-f showed a porous structure for all these microspheres, which were agglomerated ensembles of nanoparticles.The literature 24,29 and our previous studies 14,20 demonstrated that anatase TiO 2 had very fine particles in the size range of 8-10 nm.The anatase-rich TiO 2 aggregates of particles were in the size range of 50 nm, while the brookite-rich TiO 2 was made up of rod-like particles with diameters up to 50 nm and lengths up to 100 nm.The present SEM micrographs of Ag(I)/Ti(A), Ag(I)/Ti(AB) and Ag(I)/Ti(BA) in Fig. 2d-f well agree with the literature observations.For the in situ photoreduced Ag(0)/TiO 2 , their morphologies and particle sizes remained the same as the Ag(I)/TiO 2 . The distribution of Ag, Ti and O elements in the Ag(I)/TiO 2 and Ag(0)/TiO 2 was analyzed by X-ray elemental mapping, and the images are shown in Fig. 3.For all three samples, Ag(I)/Ti(AB), Ag(I)/Ti(BA), and Ag(0)/Ti(BA), the elemental mapping demonstrated that Ag species (green color) were highly dispersed on the The band gap, crystal size of anatase (A) and brookite (B) phase, BET surface area, BJH pore size, and BJH pore volume of these as-prepared (untreated) Ag/TiO2 catalysts.

The T-plots fitting results suggested that there were no micropores in the three porous microspheres of Ag(I)/TiO 2 (see Fig. S2 in Supporting Information).Table 1 compares the BET surface area, pore size and pore volume of the Ag(I)/TiO 2 composites.Ag(I)/Ti(A) had the largest BET surface area (188 m 2 g -1 ), nearly 3.5 times as high as Ag(I)/Ti(P25).Ag(I)/Ti(AB) has a slightly lower surface area than Ag(I)/Ti(A), but is higher than Ag(I)/Ti(BA).This difference in the surface area probably resulted from the increasing content of brookite.However, the pore sizes and volumes of the Ag(I)/Ti(A), Ag(I)/Ti(AB) and Ag(I)/Ti(BA) were comparable (around 5 nm and 0.2 cm 3 g -1 , respectively), much smaller than that of Ag(I)/Ti(P25).The higher surface area but smaller pore size of Ag(I)/Ti(A) compared with Ag(I)/Ti(P25) was probably due to the smaller size of anatase particles (8-10 nm) than P25 particles (20-25 nm) 11,28. Diffuse reflectance UV-vis spectra were recorded for the Ag/TiO 2 samples before and after the in situ photoreduction treatment, as shown in Fig. 5.For the untreated Ag(I)/TiO 2 (Fig. 5a), the absorption with an onset at around 380 nm was due to the band gap transition of TiO 2 .There was no surface plasma resonance (SPR) band around 400-500 nm for the Ag(0) particles.The absence of an SPR signal indirectly suggested the existence of Ag(I) on the as-prepared catalyst surface 17 For the treated Ag(0)/TiO 2 composites (Fig. 5b), the absorption edges of TiO 2 did not shift.Significantly different from the Ag(I)/TiO 2 , an obvious SPR band around 400-600 nm appeared on the Ag(0)/Ti(A), Ag(0)/Ti(AB), Ag(0)/Ti(BA) and Ag(0)/Ti(P25).This unique SPR peak reveals the reduction of Ag(I) into Ag(0) by photo-illumination in the presence of H 2 O/CH 3 OH vapor.Table 1 compares the band gaps of the as-prepared Ag(I)/TiO 2 composites derived from the UV-vis spectra in Fig. 5.With the increase of brookite content, the band gaps of Ag(I)/Ti(A), Ag(I)/Ti(AB) and Ag(I)/Ti(BA) slightly increased from 3.23 to 3.26 and 3.31 eV.It was noted that treatment did not narrow or enlarge the band gaps of the Ag(0)/TiO 2 , probably because Ag species were dispersed on the surface but not doped into the lattice of TiO 2 15.The reduction of Ag(I) to Ag(0) was also supported by the physical appearance of the catalysts.As shown in Fig. 6, the in situ photoreduction treatment induced the color change from initial dark gray to brownish or reddish gray.This color transformation was in agreement with the study by Kawahara et al. 30 that the reduction of Ag(I) to Ag(0) by UV light irradiation resulted in the appearance of a brownish gray color in the Ag-TiO 2 nanocomposite films.Krejcikova et al. 17 also found that Ag(0) was not present in the as-prepared Ag/TiO 2 at a low concentration (2 wt.), while the presence of metallic Ag(0) induced the color change from dark to yellow.The UV-vis spectra and the color change suggest that the untreated surfaces were dominated by Ag(I) and the treated surfaces were covered with the majority of Ag(0).The method of using CO as a smart IR probing molecule is often applied to identify the oxidation state of metals (e.g., Cu, Ag, Rh) 11,31323334.To confirm whether all the Ag(I) species are transformed into Ag(0) after photoinduced reduction of Ag(I)/TiO 2 , in situ DRIFTS of CO adsorption has been conducted on Ag/Ti(P25) before and after in situ photoreduction by introducing a certain amount of CO into the DRIFTS cell, because CO could be selectively coordinated with Ag(I) (2160-2170 cm -1 ) and Ag(0) (2020-2060 cm -1 ) at different positions 32,33.As shown in Fig. 7 and two weak peaks at 2069 and 2024 cm -1 for Ag(0)-CO 32,33.This observation indicated that the surface of Ag(I)/Ti(P25) was rich in Ag(I) species with minor Ag(0).For Ag(0)/Ti(P25) (after in situ photoreduction), the Ag(I)-CO peak at 2161 cm -1 significantly decreased.Meanwhile, a strong peak of Ag(0)-CO at 2024 cm -1 was observed, suggesting that Ag(0) dominated the photoreduced surface.The IR spectra changes after photoreduction indicate that the majority, but not all, of the Ag(I) was photoreduced to Ag(0).The transformation of Ag(I) to Ag(0) observed from the IR analysis agrees with the results from the analyses of UV-vis spectroscopy and the physical appearances of the samples. For the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with the water/methanol vapor mixture, CO and H 2 were found to be the major products with a minor CH 4 .Fig. 8 shows the production rates of CO, CH 4 and H 2 on the Ag(0)/Ti(A) as a function of time from one measurement.After 2 h, the production rates of CO, CH 4 and H 2 reached their maximum and steady state at 145, 5 and 1560 mol g -1 h -1 , respectively.Similar trends in production rates were also observed for Ag(0)/Ti(AB), Ag(0)/Ti(BA), and Ag(0)/Ti(P25) samples (data not shown here).Fig. 9 compares the steady-state H 2 , CO and CH 4 production rates on the various Ag(0)/Ti(M) (M A, AB, BA, P25) samples (three runs for each sample; error bars representing standard deviations).The experimental errors for the production rates of CO, CH 4 and H 2 are in the range of 5-15 (except for H 2 production over the Ag(0)/Ti(A) sample, which is 38), which are within reasonable experimental uncertainties and indicate good reproducibility of the activity measurements.The CO production rate was comparable for Ag(0)/Ti(A) and Ag(0)/Ti(AB), and it was nearly twice as high as that of Ag(0)/Ti(BA) or Ag(0)/Ti(P25).For the CH 4 and H 2 production rates, the activities of the four samples were in the order of Ag(0)/Ti(AB) Ag(0)/Ti(A) Ag(0)/Ti(BA) Ag(0)/Ti(P25).This finding demonstrates that the Ag(0)-coupled anatase-rich bicrystalline TiO 2 anatase/brookite is a promising catalyst toward the production of solar fuels from the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O.The finding that Ag(0)/Ti(AB) is more active than Ag(0)/Ti(A) is of great importance, since Ag(0)/Ti(AB) has a smaller surface area and a slightly larger band gap than Ag(0)/Ti(A) (see Table 1).The correlations of the TiO 2 crystal sizes (Table 1) with the photocatalytic activity data (Fig. 9) suggest the crystal size does not play a significant role in differentiating the activities of Ag(0)/Ti(A) and Ag(0)/Ti(AB).Even though the brookite crystal size is larger than that of anatase, the Ag(0)/Ti(AB) activity is still higher than that of Ag(0)/Ti(A).A most likely reason for this improved activity of Ag(0)/Ti(AB) is the enhanced interfacial electron transfer between anatase and brookite nanocrystals in Ag(0)/Ti(AB).The conduction band (CB) edge of brookite was about 0.14 eV more negative than that of anatase 24,25,35, which would induce transfer of the photoexcited electrons from brookite to anatase 28.In addition, Schottky barriers formed by the metal/semiconductor contact may exist at three interfaces of Ag(0)/Ti(AB), i.e., Ag(0)-anatase, Ag(0)-brookite, and Ag(0)-anatase/brookite heterojunctions.The Ag(0)-anatase/brookite interfaces may be more efficient in facilitating the electron migration from the TiO 2 to the Ag(0) sites.Hence, the combinational benefits from the electron transfer between the two phases and the Schottky barriers at the Ag(0)-anatase/brookite interfaces could have caused the higher activity of Ag(0)/Ti(AB) than Ag(0)/Ti(A).The higher activity of Ag(0)/Ti(AB) than Ag(0)/Ti(BA) was possibly because of the smaller surface area, the larger fraction of brookite that has a larger crystal size than anatase, and the larger band gap of Ag/Ti(BA) (see Table 1).There should be an optimum ratio of anatase/brookite, which depends on the photocatalytic activity of individual anatase and brookite phases, as well as the charge transfer between their interfaces.This study clearly indicates that anatase-rich A/B is more active than brookite-rich A/B; quantitative determination of this optimum ratio will be investigated in our future study.Another important finding is that Ag(0)/Ti(AB) is much more active than Ag(0)/Ti(P25).This finding indicates that the coupling of brookite to anatase is more effective than the coupling of rutile to anatase, likely because of a faster charge recombination rate within rutile crystals than within brookite 22,23 and less reduction ability of rutile due to the lower CB potential of rutile than brookite 27.The smallest surface area and the largest crystal size of Ag/Ti(P25) (see Table 1) may also contribute to its lowest photocatalytic activity. Besides the crystal phase effect of TiO 2 , the photocatalytic activities of Ag/TiO 2 were also affected by the Ag valence state.Fig. 10 compares the production rates of CO, CH 4 , and H 2 on the Ag(I)/Ti(AB)-SP and Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-SP.The production rates of CO were comparable on the Ag(I)/Ti(AB)-SP and Ag(I)/Ti(AB)-SP, but a fourfold and twofold enhancement was observed on Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-SP for the production rate of CH 4 and H 2 , respectively.This result demonstrated that Ag(0) obtained by the in situ photoreducion pretreatment played a more important role than Ag(I) for CO 2 reduction and H 2 O splitting.Ag(I) can act as an electron trapper to inhibit the charge recombination 16,18.However, the high reduction potential of Ag(I)/Ag(0) (0.8 eV) induces a strong interaction of Ag(I) with the trapped electrons.As indicated in the literature 18,36, this interaction could lead to a partial reduction of Ag(I) to Ag(0), consuming electrons rather than facilitating the trapped electrons to migrate to the surface-adsorbed CO 2 and H 2 O.This limitation hence lowers the photocatalytic performance of Ag(I)/Ti(AB)-SP.By contrast, Ag(0) serves as a sink to accumulate photogenerated electrons via the Schottky barrier at the Ag(0)-TiO 2 interface 5,9,10,17.As a result, more electrons are available on the Ag(0) sites, which promote the H 2 production from H 2 O splitting and the multi-electron process for CH 4 formation. To check the possibility of Ag(I)/TiO 2 transferring to Ag(0)/TiO 2 during the photocatalytic reaction and the repeated activity of Ag(I)/TiO 2 , the catalytic performance of Ag(I)/Ti(AB) for CO, CH 4 and H 2 production was conducted for three continuous UV on/off cycles.In each cycle, the UV light was turned on for 45 min and then turned off while the reactor was purged until no products were detected by the GC.The UV illumination time, 45 min, was consistent with the time spent during in situ photoreduction of catalysts with He H 2 O/CH 3 OH for preparing the Ag(0)/TiO 2 .Fig. S3 in Supporting Information shows the production rates of CO, CH 4 , and H 2 during the three-cycle process.The activity results demonstrated that the overall CO 2 photoreduction rate was increased over three cycles, most likely because of the transformation of Ag(I) to Ag(0).The three-cycle testing result again verifies our previous conclusion that Ag(0) species is more active than Ag(I) in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 by Ag/TiO 2 . To evaluate the significance of Ag(0) generated from the sequential spray pyrolysis and the in situ photoreduction treatment (SP method), two additional samples, prepared from PD and WI methods, were used as controls.Fig. 10 compares the activities of Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-SP, Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-PD and Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-WI.The maximum CO production rate of Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-SP was slightly higher than that of Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-PD, while its CH 4 and H 2 production rates were 9 and 3 times higher than that of Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-PD.The inferior activity of Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-PD likely resulted from its lower fraction of surface Ag(0).As supported by the UV-vis spectra of Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-PD (data not shown here), only a very weak SPR band for Ag(0) was observed, indicating a very small amount of Ag(0) on the catalyst surface.This result reasonably demonstrated that a high fraction of Ag(0) cannot be obtained by the ex situ photodeposition method in an air environment, while the in situ photoreduction treatment could avoid the partial oxidation of Ag(0) back to Ag(I).In addition, the CO, CH 4 and H 2 production rates of Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-SP were 7, 10 and 22 times higher than those of Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-WI.In agreement with our previous work 5, the result in this work again demonstrated the advantages of the spray pyrolysis process over the conventional wet-impregnation process by dispersing the Ag nanoparticles more uniformly on the TiO 2 surface. From all the photocatalytic activity results obtained (Figs. 9 and 10), one can see that the production rate of CH 4 was generally one order of magnitude lower than that of CO, while the production rate of H 2 was one order of magnitude higher than that of CO.The low CH 4 production from CO 2 photoreduction may be due to the following two reasons.First, an eight-electron transfer process to generate CH 4 is more difficult to proceed than a two-electron process to generate CO 5,10.Second, the CH 4 formation rate may be limited by that of CO, since CO may be the precursor for CH 4 generation 37.Possible reasons for the higher H 2 production from H 2 O splitting than CO and CH 4 from CO 2 photoreduction are: (1) the reduction potential of CO 2 /CO (-0.53 V at pH 7 vs.NHE) is more negative than that of H 2 O/H 2 (-0.41 V at pH 7 vs.NHE), making it easier to produce H 2 1,3,4; (2) the Ag(0) cocatalyst on TiO 2 facilitates H 2 production to a larger extent than it facilitates CO and CH 4 production. To evaluate the carbon source of CO and CH 4 , a control experiment was conducted on Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-SP with an introduction of helium (instead of CO 2 ) H 2 O/CH 3 OH vapor.In this control experiment, the production rates of CO and CH 4 were reduced by nearly 3 and 10 times compared with those using CO 2 as the feed gas.This result proved that CO and CH 4 were primarily derived from CO 2 and to a much less extent derived from CH 3 OH."}], "light source": [{"llm generation": "UV-vis", "source": "The Ag/TiO 2 composites were applied as photocatalysts for CO 2 reduction with H 2 O, using methanol as a hole scavenger under UV-vis irradiation.", "context": "Ag nanoparticles deposited on porous TiO 2 microspheres with controllable Ag valence and TiO 2 crystal phase were prepared through a sequential hydrothermal, ultrasonic spray pyrolysis and in situ photoreduction process.The crystal phase of TiO 2 , i.e., pure anatase (A), an anatase-rich anatase/brookite mixture (AB), or a brookite-rich anatase/brookite mixture (BA), was controlled by varying the hydrothermal reaction environment.The as-prepared Ag/TiO 2 was dominated by the Ag(I) species, while Ag(0) was the major Ag species upon in situ photoreduction of the as-prepared Ag(I)/TiO 2 .The Ag/TiO 2 composites were applied as photocatalysts for CO 2 reduction with H 2 O, using methanol as a hole scavenger under UV-vis irradiation.Simultaneous production of hydrogen (H 2 ) and carbon-containing fuels (CO, CH 4 ) was observed.The CH 4 and H 2 production rates by Ag(0)/TiO 2 exhibited a two-fold enhancement compared with Ag(I)/TiO 2 .The Ag(0)/TiO 2 catalysts using TiO 2 (AB) as the support demonstrated 50 higher activity than using TiO 2 (A) as the support and more than three times higher activity than using TiO 2 (BA) and TiO 2 (P25) as the supports.In addition, the novel in situ photoreduction method of producing Ag(0) nanoparticles was superior to conventional ex situ photo-deposition and wet-impregnation methods, as evidenced by one order of magnitude higher activity of the catalysts prepared by the novel method.The superb activity of the Ag(0)/Ti(AB) catalysts was ascribed to their large surface area, small and well-dispersed Ag(0) nanoparticles, and an enhanced interfacial charge transfer between the anatase and brookite nanocrystals."}, {"llm generation": "Solar simulator", "source": "A 150 W solar simulator (Oriel) was used as the light source, with a light intensity of about 90 mW/cm 2 in the range of 200-900 nm.", "context": "Ag/TiO 2 composite microspheres were prepared by combining a hydrothermal and an ultrasonic spray pyrolysis (USP) method.In the first step, TiO 2 in pure anatase, anatase/brookite mixture, or pure brookite phase was prepared by a hydrothermal method.To prepare pure anatase TiO 2 , 10 ml of a titanium bis (ammonium lactate) dihydroxide (TALH) aqueous solution (50) and a 0.1 M urea solution were mixed, followed by the addition of distilled water to reach a final volume of 100 ml.The resulting solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave, which was sealed and placed in an electric oven held at 160 C for 24 h.Then, the autoclave was naturally cooled in air.The precipitates were separated by centrifugation and washed with distilled water until pH 7. The obtained TiO 2 nanoparticle suspension was the precursor for Ag/TiO 2 microspheres in the next step.To prepare mixed anatase/brookite and pure brookite TiO 2 , a similar procedure was performed but the concentration of urea in the precursor solution was changed to 0.5 and 7 M, respectively.Increasing the urea concentration favors the production of brookite content. In the second step, Ag/TiO 2 composite microspheres were prepared by an USP process, similar to that reported in our previous study 5.The spraying solution was prepared by mixing an aqueous AgNO 3 solution and TiO 2 nanoparticle suspensions and sonicating for 30 min.The mixture was fed to an ultrasonic nebulizer (Sonaer) that has a frequency of 2.4 MHz and produces droplets with a volumetric mean diameter of 1.8 m.The generated fine mists containing AgNO 3 /TiO 2 were carried out by nitrogen gas and passed through a diffusion dryer composed of silica gels to dry out the mists.The aerosols subsequently passed through a cylindrical quartz tube that was placed inside a tube furnace (Thermo Fisher) with a set temperature of 500 C. The spray-pyrolyzed particles were collected on a glass fiber filter placed inside a stainless-steel filter holder.The resulting powder was finally calcined at 400 C for 2 h in air to form the Ag/TiO 2 composites. The as-prepared Ag/TiO 2 surfaces were identified to be rich in Ag(I) species, as reported in a later section of the paper.To prepare Ag(0)/TiO 2 , the as-prepared Ag/TiO 2 was photoreduced in situ for 45 min under UV-vis light irradiation.Different from the conventional photo-deposition method (operated in an aqueous solution where Ag is reduced to Ag 0 ), the in situ photoreduction of Ag(I) in this work was conducted at a solid-gas interface just prior to the CO 2 photocatalytic reaction in the same reactor used for CO 2 photoreduction.A stream of helium (10 ml/min) as a carrier gas was bubbled through a water/methanol bath and passed through the Ag/TiO 2 surface, where Ag(I) could be reduced to Ag(0) under UV-vis irradiation with methanol vapor acting as the reducing agent.This novel in situ reduction method could avoid the re-oxidation of Ag(0) back to Ag(I) in an air environment when a conventional ex situ photo-deposition method was used.The untreated and treated (in situ photoreduced) Ag/TiO 2 catalysts were denoted as Ag(I)/Ti(M) and Ag(0)/Ti(M), respectively, where M A, AB, BA, or P25, representing the crystal phase of TiO 2 (A: anatase, AB: anatase-rich anatase/brookite mixture, BA: brookite-rich anatase/brookite mixture, P25: anatase/rutile with 75/25 phase ratio). In comparison with the above mentioned sequential spray pyrolysis and an in situ photoreduction method (abbreviated as SP method), two other methods, photo-deposition (PD) and wetimpregnation (WI) were used as controls.In the photo-deposition method, TiO 2 microspheres were first made by the USP process and then immersed in a Ag(NO 3 ) solution under UV irradiation where Ag(0) nanoparticles were expected to form and deposit on the TiO 2 surface.The in situ photoreduction process was not performed for the PD sample.In the wet-impregnation method, TiO 2 nanoparticles were mixed with a Ag(NO 3 ) solution and directly calcined at 400 C for 2 h in air without undergoing the USP process, and thus the WI sample did not have the porous spherical structure.The WI sample was subject to the in situ photoreduction process before CO 2 photocatalytic reaction was conducted.The three types of Ag(0)/Ti(AB) catalysts prepared by the SP, PD, and WI methods were denoted as Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-SP, Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-PD, and Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-WI, respectively. The crystal structures of the Ag/TiO 2 samples were identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Scintag XDS 2000) using Cu K irradiation at 45 kV, and a diffracted beam monochromator at 40 mA.Raman spectroscopy was carried out with a Renishaw 1000B system in the range of 100-700 cm -1 .The surface area, pore size and pore volume of Ag/TiO 2 were analyzed by nitrogen adsorption-desorption at 77 K using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method (Micromeritics, ASAP 2020).The optical properties were examined by UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy using a UV-vis spectrometer (Ocean Optics) with BaSO 4 as the background.Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Hitachi S4800) was used to investigate the catalyst morphology.The dispersion of elements (Ag, Ti, O) on Ag/TiO 2 was analyzed by X-ray elemental mapping.In addition, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) was conducted to measure the surface concentration of Ag. In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) of CO adsorption was conducted to probe the Ag valence on Ag/TiO 2 , using a Nicolet 6700 spectrometer (Thermo Electron) and a DRIFTS accessory (Praying Mantis).The dome of the DRIFTS cell has two KBr windows allowing IR transmission and a third (quartz) window allowing transmission of irradiation introduced through a liquid light guide (Newport) that connects to a 450 W Xe arc system (Oriel).Details of the DRIFTS setup can be found in our previous work 11.In situ DRIFTS spectra of the CO interaction with Ag/TiO 2 were recorded for both unpretreated and in situ photoreduced samples.For the unpretreated sample, Ag(I)/Ti(P25), the background spectrum in the presence of the sample was collected after purging with an ample amount of He. 5 CO balanced in He (99.999,Praxair) was then continuously introduced into the chamber at 4.0 mL/min for 20 min, and the IR spectra were recorded with time.For the photoreduced sample, Ag(0)/Ti(P25), the IR spectra were collected after Ag(I)/Ti(P25) was photoreduced in situ by bubbling a He H 2 O/CH 3 OH mixture to the DRIFTS cell under UV-vis irradiation for 45 min. The experiments of CO 2 photoreduction with H 2 O vapor in the presence of gas-phase CH 3 OH (a hole scavenger) were carried out in a setup similar to that reported in our previous study 5.For each test, 30 mg of catalysts were used and dispersed on a glass fiber inside the reactor.CO 2 continuously passed through a bubbler to bring a mixed gas of CO 2 /H 2 O/CH 3 OH (97.1/2.3/0.6 volume ratio) into the reactor at a flow rate of 4.0 ml/min.A 150 W solar simulator (Oriel) was used as the light source, with a light intensity of about 90 mW/cm 2 in the range of 200-900 nm.The gaseous products in the reactor effluent were continuously analyzed by a gas chromatograph (GC, Agilent 7890A) equipped with both a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a flame ionization detector (FID).The photocatalytic activity of each catalyst was measured three times using different batches of samples and the average values and standard deviations were reported."}, {"llm generation": "UV", "source": "To check the possibility of Ag(I)/TiO 2 transferring to Ag(0)/TiO 2 during the photocatalytic reaction and the repeated activity of Ag(I)/TiO 2 , the catalytic performance of Ag(I)/Ti(AB) for CO, CH 4 and H 2 production was conducted for three continuous UV on/off cycles.", "context": "The crystal structure of the Ag(I)/TiO 2 and Ag(0)/TiO 2 composites was examined by XRD, as shown in Fig. 1.For Ag(I)/Ti(A), all the diffraction peaks were indexed to the pure anatase phase (JCPDS No. 21-1272).For Ag(I)/Ti(AB), the patterns indicated an anatase-rich mixture of TiO 2 anatase and brookite, the compositions of which were approximately 92 anatase and 8 brookite calculated by a Rietveld refinement method.The brookite phase (JCPDS No. 29-1360) was clearly discernible in the sample of Ag(I)/Ti(BA), from its unique (1 2 1), (2 2 1), and (0 3 2) diffraction peaks at 30.81, 42.34, 46.07 (2A).This brookite-rich Ag(I)/Ti(BA) had about 70 brookite and 30 anatase.Independent batches of the TiO 2 samples were prepared and the results from the XRD and Rietveld refinement showed a less than 3 error in the brookite fraction for a certain sample, indicating good reproducibility of the catalyst preparation.This result also agrees with the literature that bicrystalline TiO 2 anatase/brookite with controllable phases could be accurately fabricated by adjusting the hydrothermal environment 24,28.In agreement with the bulk phase analysis of XRD, the results from Raman spectroscopy (a very sensitive tool to approach the surface region of a solid sample) qualitatively indicated that the surface of Ag(I)/Ti(AB) was anatase-rich with a minor brookite, while the Ag(I)/Ti(BA) surface was rich in brookite phase (see Fig. S1 in Supporting Information).The crystal size of anatase and brookite phases for Ag(I)/TiO 2 was calculated and listed in Table 1.Ag(I)/Ti(A), Ag(I)/Ti(AB), and Ag(I)/Ti(BA) have a comparable crystal size of the anatase phase around 7 nm, smaller than that of Ag(I)/Ti(P25) (around 18 nm).The crystal size of the brookite phase in Ag(I)/Ti(BA) and Ag(I)/Ti(AB) is about 13 and 16 nm, respectively, and both are larger than the crystal size of anatase.It was noted that no diffraction lines of Ag species (metallic silver or silver oxides) were observed on the three untreated samples, suggesting that Ag species were well dispersed or the Ag particle size was very small 5,17.For Ag(0)/TiO 2 samples, the crystal structures and crystal sizes are same as Ag(I)/TiO 2 samples.Ag(0)/Ti(BA) remained in the original brookite-rich phase, and no metallic Ag(0) crystals were detected.The possible reason was that at a extremely low loading level (see the EDX results), Ag(0) was highly dispersed and this low concentration was likely below the detection limit of XRD. The morphology and textural properties of the Ag(I)/TiO 2 composites were analyzed by SEM and N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms.Fig. 2 shows the SEM images of Ag(I)/TiO 2 .The low magnification SEM images in Fig. 2a-c showed that the three samples were microspheres from submicrometer to micrometer size range.The high magnification SEM images in Fig. 2d-f showed a porous structure for all these microspheres, which were agglomerated ensembles of nanoparticles.The literature 24,29 and our previous studies 14,20 demonstrated that anatase TiO 2 had very fine particles in the size range of 8-10 nm.The anatase-rich TiO 2 aggregates of particles were in the size range of 50 nm, while the brookite-rich TiO 2 was made up of rod-like particles with diameters up to 50 nm and lengths up to 100 nm.The present SEM micrographs of Ag(I)/Ti(A), Ag(I)/Ti(AB) and Ag(I)/Ti(BA) in Fig. 2d-f well agree with the literature observations.For the in situ photoreduced Ag(0)/TiO 2 , their morphologies and particle sizes remained the same as the Ag(I)/TiO 2 . The distribution of Ag, Ti and O elements in the Ag(I)/TiO 2 and Ag(0)/TiO 2 was analyzed by X-ray elemental mapping, and the images are shown in Fig. 3.For all three samples, Ag(I)/Ti(AB), Ag(I)/Ti(BA), and Ag(0)/Ti(BA), the elemental mapping demonstrated that Ag species (green color) were highly dispersed on the The band gap, crystal size of anatase (A) and brookite (B) phase, BET surface area, BJH pore size, and BJH pore volume of these as-prepared (untreated) Ag/TiO2 catalysts. Band gap (eV) Crystal size of A (nm) Crystal size of B (nm) BET surface area (m 2 g -1 ) BJH pore size (nm) BJH pore volume (cm 3 g -1 ) Ag(I)/Ti(A) 3.23 three samples displayed a type IV isotherm with H 2 type hysteresis, which were the characteristics of mesoporous solids 17.This result again confirmed the mesoporous structure of Ag/TiO 2 as indicated by the SEM images in Fig. 2. The T-plots fitting results suggested that there were no micropores in the three porous microspheres of Ag(I)/TiO 2 (see Fig. S2 in Supporting Information).Table 1 compares the BET surface area, pore size and pore volume of the Ag(I)/TiO 2 composites.Ag(I)/Ti(A) had the largest BET surface area (188 m 2 g -1 ), nearly 3.5 times as high as Ag(I)/Ti(P25).Ag(I)/Ti(AB) has a slightly lower surface area than Ag(I)/Ti(A), but is higher than Ag(I)/Ti(BA).This difference in the surface area probably resulted from the increasing content of brookite.However, the pore sizes and volumes of the Ag(I)/Ti(A), Ag(I)/Ti(AB) and Ag(I)/Ti(BA) were comparable (around 5 nm and 0.2 cm 3 g -1 , respectively), much smaller than that of Ag(I)/Ti(P25).The higher surface area but smaller pore size of Ag(I)/Ti(A) compared with Ag(I)/Ti(P25) was probably due to the smaller size of anatase particles (8-10 nm) than P25 particles (20-25 nm) 11,28. Diffuse reflectance UV-vis spectra were recorded for the Ag/TiO 2 samples before and after the in situ photoreduction treatment, as shown in Fig. 5.For the untreated Ag(I)/TiO 2 (Fig. 5a), the absorption with an onset at around 380 nm was due to the band gap transition of TiO 2 .There was no surface plasma resonance (SPR) band around 400-500 nm for the Ag(0) particles.The absence of an SPR signal indirectly suggested the existence of Ag(I) on the as-prepared catalyst surface 17 For the treated Ag(0)/TiO 2 composites (Fig. 5b), the absorption edges of TiO 2 did not shift.Significantly different from the Ag(I)/TiO 2 , an obvious SPR band around 400-600 nm appeared on the Ag(0)/Ti(A), Ag(0)/Ti(AB), Ag(0)/Ti(BA) and Ag(0)/Ti(P25).This unique SPR peak reveals the reduction of Ag(I) into Ag(0) by photo-illumination in the presence of H 2 O/CH 3 OH vapor.Table 1 compares the band gaps of the as-prepared Ag(I)/TiO 2 composites derived from the UV-vis spectra in Fig. 5.With the increase of brookite content, the band gaps of Ag(I)/Ti(A), Ag(I)/Ti(AB) and Ag(I)/Ti(BA) slightly increased from 3.23 to 3.26 and 3.31 eV.It was noted that treatment did not narrow or enlarge the band gaps of the Ag(0)/TiO 2 , probably because Ag species were dispersed on the surface but not doped into the lattice of TiO 2 15.The reduction of Ag(I) to Ag(0) was also supported by the physical appearance of the catalysts.As shown in Fig. 6, the in situ photoreduction treatment induced the color change from initial dark gray to brownish or reddish gray.This color transformation was in agreement with the study by Kawahara et al. 30 that the reduction of Ag(I) to Ag(0) by UV light irradiation resulted in the appearance of a brownish gray color in the Ag-TiO 2 nanocomposite films.Krejcikova et al. 17 also found that Ag(0) was not present in the as-prepared Ag/TiO 2 at a low concentration (2 wt.), while the presence of metallic Ag(0) induced the color change from dark to yellow.The UV-vis spectra and the color change suggest that the untreated surfaces were dominated by Ag(I) and the treated surfaces were covered with the majority of Ag(0).The method of using CO as a smart IR probing molecule is often applied to identify the oxidation state of metals (e.g., Cu, Ag, Rh) 11,31323334.To confirm whether all the Ag(I) species are transformed into Ag(0) after photoinduced reduction of Ag(I)/TiO 2 , in situ DRIFTS of CO adsorption has been conducted on Ag/Ti(P25) before and after in situ photoreduction by introducing a certain amount of CO into the DRIFTS cell, because CO could be selectively coordinated with Ag(I) (2160-2170 cm -1 ) and Ag(0) (2020-2060 cm -1 ) at different positions 32,33.As shown in Fig. 7 and two weak peaks at 2069 and 2024 cm -1 for Ag(0)-CO 32,33.This observation indicated that the surface of Ag(I)/Ti(P25) was rich in Ag(I) species with minor Ag(0).For Ag(0)/Ti(P25) (after in situ photoreduction), the Ag(I)-CO peak at 2161 cm -1 significantly decreased.Meanwhile, a strong peak of Ag(0)-CO at 2024 cm -1 was observed, suggesting that Ag(0) dominated the photoreduced surface.The IR spectra changes after photoreduction indicate that the majority, but not all, of the Ag(I) was photoreduced to Ag(0).The transformation of Ag(I) to Ag(0) observed from the IR analysis agrees with the results from the analyses of UV-vis spectroscopy and the physical appearances of the samples. For the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with the water/methanol vapor mixture, CO and H 2 were found to be the major products with a minor CH 4 .Fig. 8 shows the production rates of CO, CH 4 and H 2 on the Ag(0)/Ti(A) as a function of time from one measurement.After 2 h, the production rates of CO, CH 4 and H 2 reached their maximum and steady state at 145, 5 and 1560 mol g -1 h -1 , respectively.Similar trends in production rates were also observed for Ag(0)/Ti(AB), Ag(0)/Ti(BA), and Ag(0)/Ti(P25) samples (data not shown here).Fig. 9 compares the steady-state H 2 , CO and CH 4 production rates on the various Ag(0)/Ti(M) (M A, AB, BA, P25) samples (three runs for each sample; error bars representing standard deviations).The experimental errors for the production rates of CO, CH 4 and H 2 are in the range of 5-15 (except for H 2 production over the Ag(0)/Ti(A) sample, which is 38), which are within reasonable experimental uncertainties and indicate good reproducibility of the activity measurements.The CO production rate was comparable for Ag(0)/Ti(A) and Ag(0)/Ti(AB), and it was nearly twice as high as that of Ag(0)/Ti(BA) or Ag(0)/Ti(P25).For the CH 4 and H 2 production rates, the activities of the four samples were in the order of Ag(0)/Ti(AB) Ag(0)/Ti(A) Ag(0)/Ti(BA) Ag(0)/Ti(P25).This finding demonstrates that the Ag(0)-coupled anatase-rich bicrystalline TiO 2 anatase/brookite is a promising catalyst toward the production of solar fuels from the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O.The finding that Ag(0)/Ti(AB) is more active than Ag(0)/Ti(A) is of great importance, since Ag(0)/Ti(AB) has a smaller surface area and a slightly larger band gap than Ag(0)/Ti(A) (see Table 1).The correlations of the TiO 2 crystal sizes (Table 1) with the photocatalytic activity data (Fig. 9) suggest the crystal size does not play a significant role in differentiating the activities of Ag(0)/Ti(A) and Ag(0)/Ti(AB).Even though the brookite crystal size is larger than that of anatase, the Ag(0)/Ti(AB) activity is still higher than that of Ag(0)/Ti(A).A most likely reason for this improved activity of Ag(0)/Ti(AB) is the enhanced interfacial electron transfer between anatase and brookite nanocrystals in Ag(0)/Ti(AB).The conduction band (CB) edge of brookite was about 0.14 eV more negative than that of anatase 24,25,35, which would induce transfer of the photoexcited electrons from brookite to anatase 28.In addition, Schottky barriers formed by the metal/semiconductor contact may exist at three interfaces of Ag(0)/Ti(AB), i.e., Ag(0)-anatase, Ag(0)-brookite, and Ag(0)-anatase/brookite heterojunctions.The Ag(0)-anatase/brookite interfaces may be more efficient in facilitating the electron migration from the TiO 2 to the Ag(0) sites.Hence, the combinational benefits from the electron transfer between the two phases and the Schottky barriers at the Ag(0)-anatase/brookite interfaces could have caused the higher activity of Ag(0)/Ti(AB) than Ag(0)/Ti(A).The higher activity of Ag(0)/Ti(AB) than Ag(0)/Ti(BA) was possibly because of the smaller surface area, the larger fraction of brookite that has a larger crystal size than anatase, and the larger band gap of Ag/Ti(BA) (see Table 1).There should be an optimum ratio of anatase/brookite, which depends on the photocatalytic activity of individual anatase and brookite phases, as well as the charge transfer between their interfaces.This study clearly indicates that anatase-rich A/B is more active than brookite-rich A/B; quantitative determination of this optimum ratio will be investigated in our future study.Another important finding is that Ag(0)/Ti(AB) is much more active than Ag(0)/Ti(P25).This finding indicates that the coupling of brookite to anatase is more effective than the coupling of rutile to anatase, likely because of a faster charge recombination rate within rutile crystals than within brookite 22,23 and less reduction ability of rutile due to the lower CB potential of rutile than brookite 27.The smallest surface area and the largest crystal size of Ag/Ti(P25) (see Table 1) may also contribute to its lowest photocatalytic activity. Besides the crystal phase effect of TiO 2 , the photocatalytic activities of Ag/TiO 2 were also affected by the Ag valence state.Fig. 10 compares the production rates of CO, CH 4 , and H 2 on the Ag(I)/Ti(AB)-SP and Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-SP.The production rates of CO were comparable on the Ag(I)/Ti(AB)-SP and Ag(I)/Ti(AB)-SP, but a fourfold and twofold enhancement was observed on Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-SP for the production rate of CH 4 and H 2 , respectively.This result demonstrated that Ag(0) obtained by the in situ photoreducion pretreatment played a more important role than Ag(I) for CO 2 reduction and H 2 O splitting.Ag(I) can act as an electron trapper to inhibit the charge recombination 16,18.However, the high reduction potential of Ag(I)/Ag(0) (0.8 eV) induces a strong interaction of Ag(I) with the trapped electrons.As indicated in the literature 18,36, this interaction could lead to a partial reduction of Ag(I) to Ag(0), consuming electrons rather than facilitating the trapped electrons to migrate to the surface-adsorbed CO 2 and H 2 O.This limitation hence lowers the photocatalytic performance of Ag(I)/Ti(AB)-SP.By contrast, Ag(0) serves as a sink to accumulate photogenerated electrons via the Schottky barrier at the Ag(0)-TiO 2 interface 5,9,10,17.As a result, more electrons are available on the Ag(0) sites, which promote the H 2 production from H 2 O splitting and the multi-electron process for CH 4 formation. To check the possibility of Ag(I)/TiO 2 transferring to Ag(0)/TiO 2 during the photocatalytic reaction and the repeated activity of Ag(I)/TiO 2 , the catalytic performance of Ag(I)/Ti(AB) for CO, CH 4 and H 2 production was conducted for three continuous UV on/off cycles.In each cycle, the UV light was turned on for 45 min and then turned off while the reactor was purged until no products were detected by the GC.The UV illumination time, 45 min, was consistent with the time spent during in situ photoreduction of catalysts with He H 2 O/CH 3 OH for preparing the Ag(0)/TiO 2 .Fig. S3 in Supporting Information shows the production rates of CO, CH 4 , and H 2 during the three-cycle process.The activity results demonstrated that the overall CO 2 photoreduction rate was increased over three cycles, most likely because of the transformation of Ag(I) to Ag(0).The three-cycle testing result again verifies our previous conclusion that Ag(0) species is more active than Ag(I) in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 by Ag/TiO 2 . To evaluate the significance of Ag(0) generated from the sequential spray pyrolysis and the in situ photoreduction treatment (SP method), two additional samples, prepared from PD and WI methods, were used as controls.Fig. 10 compares the activities of Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-SP, Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-PD and Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-WI.The maximum CO production rate of Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-SP was slightly higher than that of Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-PD, while its CH 4 and H 2 production rates were 9 and 3 times higher than that of Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-PD.The inferior activity of Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-PD likely resulted from its lower fraction of surface Ag(0).As supported by the UV-vis spectra of Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-PD (data not shown here), only a very weak SPR band for Ag(0) was observed, indicating a very small amount of Ag(0) on the catalyst surface.This result reasonably demonstrated that a high fraction of Ag(0) cannot be obtained by the ex situ photodeposition method in an air environment, while the in situ photoreduction treatment could avoid the partial oxidation of Ag(0) back to Ag(I).In addition, the CO, CH 4 and H 2 production rates of Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-SP were 7, 10 and 22 times higher than those of Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-WI.In agreement with our previous work 5, the result in this work again demonstrated the advantages of the spray pyrolysis process over the conventional wet-impregnation process by dispersing the Ag nanoparticles more uniformly on the TiO 2 surface. From all the photocatalytic activity results obtained (Figs. 9 and 10), one can see that the production rate of CH 4 was generally one order of magnitude lower than that of CO, while the production rate of H 2 was one order of magnitude higher than that of CO.The low CH 4 production from CO 2 photoreduction may be due to the following two reasons.First, an eight-electron transfer process to generate CH 4 is more difficult to proceed than a two-electron process to generate CO 5,10.Second, the CH 4 formation rate may be limited by that of CO, since CO may be the precursor for CH 4 generation 37.Possible reasons for the higher H 2 production from H 2 O splitting than CO and CH 4 from CO 2 photoreduction are: (1) the reduction potential of CO 2 /CO (-0.53 V at pH 7 vs.NHE) is more negative than that of H 2 O/H 2 (-0.41 V at pH 7 vs.NHE), making it easier to produce H 2 1,3,4; (2) the Ag(0) cocatalyst on TiO 2 facilitates H 2 production to a larger extent than it facilitates CO and CH 4 production. To evaluate the carbon source of CO and CH 4 , a control experiment was conducted on Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-SP with an introduction of helium (instead of CO 2 ) H 2 O/CH 3 OH vapor.In this control experiment, the production rates of CO and CH 4 were reduced by nearly 3 and 10 times compared with those using CO 2 as the feed gas.This result proved that CO and CH 4 were primarily derived from CO 2 and to a much less extent derived from CH 3 OH."}], "lamp": [{"llm generation": "Xenon", "source": "The dome of the DRIFTS cell has two KBr windows allowing IR transmission and a third (quartz) window allowing transmission of irradiation introduced through a liquid light guide (Newport) that connects to a 450 W Xe arc system (Oriel).", "context": "Ag/TiO 2 composite microspheres were prepared by combining a hydrothermal and an ultrasonic spray pyrolysis (USP) method.In the first step, TiO 2 in pure anatase, anatase/brookite mixture, or pure brookite phase was prepared by a hydrothermal method.To prepare pure anatase TiO 2 , 10 ml of a titanium bis (ammonium lactate) dihydroxide (TALH) aqueous solution (50) and a 0.1 M urea solution were mixed, followed by the addition of distilled water to reach a final volume of 100 ml.The resulting solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave, which was sealed and placed in an electric oven held at 160 C for 24 h.Then, the autoclave was naturally cooled in air.The precipitates were separated by centrifugation and washed with distilled water until pH 7.

The morphology and textural properties of the Ag(I)/TiO 2 composites were analyzed by SEM and N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms.Fig. 2 shows the SEM images of Ag(I)/TiO 2 .The low magnification SEM images in Fig. 2a-c showed that the three samples were microspheres from submicrometer to micrometer size range.The high magnification SEM images in Fig. 2d-f showed a porous structure for all these microspheres, which were agglomerated ensembles of nanoparticles.The literature 24,29 and our previous studies 14,20 demonstrated that anatase TiO 2 had very fine particles in the size range of 8-10 nm.The anatase-rich TiO 2 aggregates of particles were in the size range of 50 nm, while the brookite-rich TiO 2 was made up of rod-like particles with diameters up to 50 nm and lengths up to 100 nm.The present SEM micrographs of Ag(I)/Ti(A), Ag(I)/Ti(AB) and Ag(I)/Ti(BA) in Fig. 2d-f well agree with the literature observations.For the in situ photoreduced Ag(0)/TiO 2 , their morphologies and particle sizes remained the same as the Ag(I)/TiO 2 . The distribution of Ag, Ti and O elements in the Ag(I)/TiO 2 and Ag(0)/TiO 2 was analyzed by X-ray elemental mapping, and the images are shown in Fig. 3.For all three samples, Ag(I)/Ti(AB), Ag(I)/Ti(BA), and Ag(0)/Ti(BA), the elemental mapping demonstrated that Ag species (green color) were highly dispersed on the The band gap, crystal size of anatase (A) and brookite (B) phase, BET surface area, BJH pore size, and BJH pore volume of these as-prepared (untreated) Ag/TiO2 catalysts. Band gap (eV) Crystal size of A (nm) Crystal size of B (nm) BET surface area (m 2 g -1 ) BJH pore size (nm) BJH pore volume (cm 3 g -1 ) Ag(I)/Ti(A) 3.23 three samples displayed a type IV isotherm with H 2 type hysteresis, which were the characteristics of mesoporous solids 17.This result again confirmed the mesoporous structure of Ag/TiO 2 as indicated by the SEM images in Fig. 2. The T-plots fitting results suggested that there were no micropores in the three porous microspheres of Ag(I)/TiO 2 (see Fig. S2 in Supporting Information).Table 1 compares the BET surface area, pore size and pore volume of the Ag(I)/TiO 2 composites.Ag(I)/Ti(A) had the largest BET surface area (188 m 2 g -1 ), nearly 3.5 times as high as Ag(I)/Ti(P25).Ag(I)/Ti(AB) has a slightly lower surface area than Ag(I)/Ti(A), but is higher than Ag(I)/Ti(BA).This difference in the surface area probably resulted from the increasing content of brookite.However, the pore sizes and volumes of the Ag(I)/Ti(A), Ag(I)/Ti(AB) and Ag(I)/Ti(BA) were comparable (around 5 nm and 0.2 cm 3 g -1 , respectively), much smaller than that of Ag(I)/Ti(P25).The higher surface area but smaller pore size of Ag(I)/Ti(A) compared with Ag(I)/Ti(P25) was probably due to the smaller size of anatase particles (8-10 nm) than P25 particles (20-25 nm) 11,28. Diffuse reflectance UV-vis spectra were recorded for the Ag/TiO 2 samples before and after the in situ photoreduction treatment, as shown in Fig. 5.For the untreated Ag(I)/TiO 2 (Fig. 5a), the absorption with an onset at around 380 nm was due to the band gap transition of TiO 2 .There was no surface plasma resonance (SPR) band around 400-500 nm for the Ag(0) particles.The absence of an SPR signal indirectly suggested the existence of Ag(I) on the as-prepared catalyst surface 17 For the treated Ag(0)/TiO 2 composites (Fig. 5b), the absorption edges of TiO 2 did not shift.Significantly different from the Ag(I)/TiO 2 , an obvious SPR band around 400-600 nm appeared on the Ag(0)/Ti(A), Ag(0)/Ti(AB), Ag(0)/Ti(BA) and Ag(0)/Ti(P25).This unique SPR peak reveals the reduction of Ag(I) into Ag(0) by photo-illumination in the presence of H 2 O/CH 3 OH vapor.Table 1 compares the band gaps of the as-prepared Ag(I)/TiO 2 composites derived from the UV-vis spectra in Fig. 5.With the increase of brookite content, the band gaps of Ag(I)/Ti(A), Ag(I)/Ti(AB) and Ag(I)/Ti(BA) slightly increased from 3.23 to 3.26 and 3.31 eV.It was noted that treatment did not narrow or enlarge the band gaps of the Ag(0)/TiO 2 , probably because Ag species were dispersed on the surface but not doped into the lattice of TiO 2 15.The reduction of Ag(I) to Ag(0) was also supported by the physical appearance of the catalysts.As shown in Fig. 6, the in situ photoreduction treatment induced the color change from initial dark gray to brownish or reddish gray.This color transformation was in agreement with the study by Kawahara et al. 30 that the reduction of Ag(I) to Ag(0) by UV light irradiation resulted in the appearance of a brownish gray color in the Ag-TiO 2 nanocomposite films.Krejcikova et al. 17 also found that Ag(0) was not present in the as-prepared Ag/TiO 2 at a low concentration (2 wt.), while the presence of metallic Ag(0) induced the color change from dark to yellow.The UV-vis spectra and the color change suggest that the untreated surfaces were dominated by Ag(I) and the treated surfaces were covered with the majority of Ag(0).The method of using CO as a smart IR probing molecule is often applied to identify the oxidation state of metals (e.g., Cu, Ag, Rh) 11,31323334.To confirm whether all the Ag(I) species are transformed into Ag(0) after photoinduced reduction of Ag(I)/TiO 2 , in situ DRIFTS of CO adsorption has been conducted on Ag/Ti(P25) before and after in situ photoreduction by introducing a certain amount of CO into the DRIFTS cell, because CO could be selectively coordinated with Ag(I) (2160-2170 cm -1 ) and Ag(0) (2020-2060 cm -1 ) at different positions 32,33.As shown in Fig. 7 and two weak peaks at 2069 and 2024 cm -1 for Ag(0)-CO 32,33.This observation indicated that the surface of Ag(I)/Ti(P25) was rich in Ag(I) species with minor Ag(0).For Ag(0)/Ti(P25) (after in situ photoreduction), the Ag(I)-CO peak at 2161 cm -1 significantly decreased.Meanwhile, a strong peak of Ag(0)-CO at 2024 cm -1 was observed, suggesting that Ag(0) dominated the photoreduced surface.The IR spectra changes after photoreduction indicate that the majority, but not all, of the Ag(I) was photoreduced to Ag(0).The transformation of Ag(I) to Ag(0) observed from the IR analysis agrees with the results from the analyses of UV-vis spectroscopy and the physical appearances of the samples. For the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with the water/methanol vapor mixture, CO and H 2 were found to be the major products with a minor CH 4 .Fig. 8 shows the production rates of CO, CH 4 and H 2 on the Ag(0)/Ti(A) as a function of time from one measurement.After 2 h, the production rates of CO, CH 4 and H 2 reached their maximum and steady state at 145, 5 and 1560 mol g -1 h -1 , respectively.Similar trends in production rates were also observed for Ag(0)/Ti(AB), Ag(0)/Ti(BA), and Ag(0)/Ti(P25) samples (data not shown here).Fig. 9 compares the steady-state H 2 , CO and CH 4 production rates on the various Ag(0)/Ti(M) (M A, AB, BA, P25) samples (three runs for each sample; error bars representing standard deviations).The experimental errors for the production rates of CO, CH 4 and H 2 are in the range of 5-15 (except for H 2 production over the Ag(0)/Ti(A) sample, which is 38), which are within reasonable experimental uncertainties and indicate good reproducibility of the activity measurements.The CO production rate was comparable for Ag(0)/Ti(A) and Ag(0)/Ti(AB), and it was nearly twice as high as that of Ag(0)/Ti(BA) or Ag(0)/Ti(P25).For the CH 4 and H 2 production rates, the activities of the four samples were in the order of Ag(0)/Ti(AB) Ag(0)/Ti(A) Ag(0)/Ti(BA) Ag(0)/Ti(P25).This finding demonstrates that the Ag(0)-coupled anatase-rich bicrystalline TiO 2 anatase/brookite is a promising catalyst toward the production of solar fuels from the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O.The finding that Ag(0)/Ti(AB) is more active than Ag(0)/Ti(A) is of great importance, since Ag(0)/Ti(AB) has a smaller surface area and a slightly larger band gap than Ag(0)/Ti(A) (see Table 1).The correlations of the TiO 2 crystal sizes (Table 1) with the photocatalytic activity data (Fig. 9) suggest the crystal size does not play a significant role in differentiating the activities of Ag(0)/Ti(A) and Ag(0)/Ti(AB).Even though the brookite crystal size is larger than that of anatase, the Ag(0)/Ti(AB) activity is still higher than that of Ag(0)/Ti(A).A most likely reason for this improved activity of Ag(0)/Ti(AB) is the enhanced interfacial electron transfer between anatase and brookite nanocrystals in Ag(0)/Ti(AB).The conduction band (CB) edge of brookite was about 0.14 eV more negative than that of anatase 24,25,35, which would induce transfer of the photoexcited electrons from brookite to anatase 28.In addition, Schottky barriers formed by the metal/semiconductor contact may exist at three interfaces of Ag(0)/Ti(AB), i.e., Ag(0)-anatase, Ag(0)-brookite, and Ag(0)-anatase/brookite heterojunctions.The Ag(0)-anatase/brookite interfaces may be more efficient in facilitating the electron migration from the TiO 2 to the Ag(0) sites.Hence, the combinational benefits from the electron transfer between the two phases and the Schottky barriers at the Ag(0)-anatase/brookite interfaces could have caused the higher activity of Ag(0)/Ti(AB) than Ag(0)/Ti(A).The higher activity of Ag(0)/Ti(AB) than Ag(0)/Ti(BA) was possibly because of the smaller surface area, the larger fraction of brookite that has a larger crystal size than anatase, and the larger band gap of Ag/Ti(BA) (see Table 1).There should be an optimum ratio of anatase/brookite, which depends on the photocatalytic activity of individual anatase and brookite phases, as well as the charge transfer between their interfaces.This study clearly indicates that anatase-rich A/B is more active than brookite-rich A/B; quantitative determination of this optimum ratio will be investigated in our future study.Another important finding is that Ag(0)/Ti(AB) is much more active than Ag(0)/Ti(P25).This finding indicates that the coupling of brookite to anatase is more effective than the coupling of rutile to anatase, likely because of a faster charge recombination rate within rutile crystals than within brookite 22,23 and less reduction ability of rutile due to the lower CB potential of rutile than brookite 27.The smallest surface area and the largest crystal size of Ag/Ti(P25) (see Table 1) may also contribute to its lowest photocatalytic activity. Besides the crystal phase effect of TiO 2 , the photocatalytic activities of Ag/TiO 2 were also affected by the Ag valence state.Fig. 10 compares the production rates of CO, CH 4 , and H 2 on the Ag(I)/Ti(AB)-SP and Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-SP.The production rates of CO were comparable on the Ag(I)/Ti(AB)-SP and Ag(I)/Ti(AB)-SP, but a fourfold and twofold enhancement was observed on Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-SP for the production rate of CH 4 and H 2 , respectively.This result demonstrated that Ag(0) obtained by the in situ photoreducion pretreatment played a more important role than Ag(I) for CO 2 reduction and H 2 O splitting.Ag(I) can act as an electron trapper to inhibit the charge recombination 16,18.However, the high reduction potential of Ag(I)/Ag(0) (0.8 eV) induces a strong interaction of Ag(I) with the trapped electrons.As indicated in the literature 18,36, this interaction could lead to a partial reduction of Ag(I) to Ag(0), consuming electrons rather than facilitating the trapped electrons to migrate to the surface-adsorbed CO 2 and H 2 O.This limitation hence lowers the photocatalytic performance of Ag(I)/Ti(AB)-SP.By contrast, Ag(0) serves as a sink to accumulate photogenerated electrons via the Schottky barrier at the Ag(0)-TiO 2 interface 5,9,10,17.As a result, more electrons are available on the Ag(0) sites, which promote the H 2 production from H 2 O splitting and the multi-electron process for CH 4 formation. To check the possibility of Ag(I)/TiO 2 transferring to Ag(0)/TiO 2 during the photocatalytic reaction and the repeated activity of Ag(I)/TiO 2 , the catalytic performance of Ag(I)/Ti(AB) for CO, CH 4 and H 2 production was conducted for three continuous UV on/off cycles.In each cycle, the UV light was turned on for 45 min and then turned off while the reactor was purged until no products were detected by the GC.The UV illumination time, 45 min, was consistent with the time spent during in situ photoreduction of catalysts with He H 2 O/CH 3 OH for preparing the Ag(0)/TiO 2 .Fig. S3 in Supporting Information shows the production rates of CO, CH 4 , and H 2 during the three-cycle process.The activity results demonstrated that the overall CO 2 photoreduction rate was increased over three cycles, most likely because of the transformation of Ag(I) to Ag(0).The three-cycle testing result again verifies our previous conclusion that Ag(0) species is more active than Ag(I) in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 by Ag/TiO 2 . To evaluate the significance of Ag(0) generated from the sequential spray pyrolysis and the in situ photoreduction treatment (SP method), two additional samples, prepared from PD and WI methods, were used as controls.Fig. 10 compares the activities of Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-SP, Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-PD and Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-WI.The maximum CO production rate of Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-SP was slightly higher than that of Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-PD, while its CH 4 and H 2 production rates were 9 and 3 times higher than that of Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-PD.The inferior activity of Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-PD likely resulted from its lower fraction of surface Ag(0).As supported by the UV-vis spectra of Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-PD (data not shown here), only a very weak SPR band for Ag(0) was observed, indicating a very small amount of Ag(0) on the catalyst surface.This result reasonably demonstrated that a high fraction of Ag(0) cannot be obtained by the ex situ photodeposition method in an air environment, while the in situ photoreduction treatment could avoid the partial oxidation of Ag(0) back to Ag(I).In addition, the CO, CH 4 and H 2 production rates of Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-SP were 7, 10 and 22 times higher than those of Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-WI.In agreement with our previous work 5, the result in this work again demonstrated the advantages of the spray pyrolysis process over the conventional wet-impregnation process by dispersing the Ag nanoparticles more uniformly on the TiO 2 surface. From all the photocatalytic activity results obtained (Figs. 9 and 10), one can see that the production rate of CH 4 was generally one order of magnitude lower than that of CO, while the production rate of H 2 was one order of magnitude higher than that of CO.The low CH 4 production from CO 2 photoreduction may be due to the following two reasons.First, an eight-electron transfer process to generate CH 4 is more difficult to proceed than a two-electron process to generate CO 5,10.Second, the CH 4 formation rate may be limited by that of CO, since CO may be the precursor for CH 4 generation 37.Possible reasons for the higher H 2 production from H 2 O splitting than CO and CH 4 from CO 2 photoreduction are: (1) the reduction potential of CO 2 /CO (-0.53 V at pH 7 vs.NHE) is more negative than that of H 2 O/H 2 (-0.41 V at pH 7 vs.NHE), making it easier to produce H 2 1,3,4; (2) the Ag(0) cocatalyst on TiO 2 facilitates H 2 production to a larger extent than it facilitates CO and CH 4 production. To evaluate the carbon source of CO and CH 4 , a control experiment was conducted on Ag(0)/Ti(AB)-SP with an introduction of helium (instead of CO 2 ) H 2 O/CH 3 OH vapor.In this control experiment, the production rates of CO and CH 4 were reduced by nearly 3 and 10 times compared with those using CO 2 as the feed gas.This result proved that CO and CH 4 were primarily derived from CO 2 and to a much less extent derived from CH 3 OH."}, {"llm generation": "Liquid", "source": "This work has investigated the effects of a TiO 2 crystal phase, an Ag valence, and a preparation method on the photocatalytic performance of Ag/TiO 2 composites for CO 2 photoreduction with water in the presence of methanol.", "context": "This work has investigated the effects of a TiO 2 crystal phase, an Ag valence, and a preparation method on the photocatalytic performance of Ag/TiO 2 composites for CO 2 photoreduction with water in the presence of methanol.The material property analysis and photocatalytic activity results demonstrated that anatase-rich anatase/brookite (AB) mixed-phase TiO 2 is an excellent photocatalyst that exhibited higher activity than pure anatase, a brookite-rich anatase/brookite mixture, and anatase/rutile (P25).The interfacial charge transfer between anatase and brookite is believed to play an important role to enhance the catalytic activity.Ag(0)-incorporated TiO 2 (AB) was more active than Ag(I)-incorporated TiO 2 (AB), indicating the importance of ensuring the right Ag valence on the catalyst surface.This study also presented a novel and effective method to disperse Ag(0) uniformly on the TiO 2 surface, i.e., the sequential spray pyrolysis and the in situ photoreduction process (SP method).This SP method is much superior to the conventional ex situ photodeposition (PD) and wet-impregnation (WI) process, as evidenced by one order of magnitude higher production of H 2 and CH 4 .Although this work has suggested that the interfaces between TiO 2 anatase and brookite as well as those between Ag(0) and TiO 2 are critical for enhanced CO 2 photoreduction, the exact charge transfer mechanism is not well understood.Future work is necessary to explore the mechanism in a systematic manner by applying spectroscopic analysis (such as FTIR and EPR) and correlating with material properties and photocatalytic activities.
