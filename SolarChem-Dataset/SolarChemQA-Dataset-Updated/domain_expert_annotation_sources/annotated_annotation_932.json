For the synthesis of CuO coatings, the cleaned substrates were inserted in a cylindrical microwave reactor with 0.38 M of Cu(CH 3 COO) 2 H 2 O (Fermont, 99).This concentration was chosen since it produced high surface area and 1D morphology of CuO, according to previous work 10.The solution obtained was maintained under vigorous stirring for 30 min.Then, NaOH (Fermont, 99) was stoichiometrically added in the first solution.The reactor was irradiated with microwaves in an equipment model Mars 6 at 80 C and 300 W for 1 h.The coatings were washed several times with deionized water to remove the by-products generated during the synthesis.The samples were dried at 80 C overnight and were identified as Cu/GFx, where x denotes the glass fiber used: GF1, GF2, and GF3. The glass fibers were characterized by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) using a Panalytical Epsilon X-ray fluorescence equipment.The crystal phase of the coatings was identified using a diffractometer X-ray Bruker D8 Advance.The crystallite size was estimated employing the Debye-Scherrer's equation 18.The morphology was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy using a microscope model JEOL 6490.For this purpose, the samples were covered with Au-Pd alloy.The surface of the coatings was investigated by Raman spectroscopy using a microscope model Renishaw inVia with 514 nm excitation laser in a range of 200-1000 cm -1 .The surface of the glass fibers and coatings was analyzed using an optical microscope model LUXO 273RB-RLI.The bandgap energy was determinate in a UV-Vis NIR spectrophotometer Cary 5000.This value was estimated by the Kubelka-Munk remission function.X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS) was measured in a Thermo Scientific K-alpha spectrometer with a monochromatic Al X-ray source (19.2 W).C 1s at 284.8 eV was used as a reference to calibrate the photoelectron energy shift.The relative concentrations of copper species (Cu 2 O, CuO and CuCO 3 ) on the coatings were calculated by Eq. 1, in which A X (x 1,2 and 3) is the area of the peaks for the species (A1, A2, A3), while S represents the area of the shake-up photoemission peaks (S1 and S2) 19. The shape and crystal structure of CuO were determined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) using a JEOL 2010 microscope.For TEM characterization, the CuO was suspended on isopropanol.The solution was dropped on 300 mesh Lacey carbon grids and dried under laboratory conditions.It is important to mention that it was not possible to analyze the coating on the glass fiber, since due to its nature, it could detach small microfibers that could damage the TEM filament, so powders of this sample were analyzed. Photocurrent measurements were performed in FTO glass.For this purpose, the working electrode was prepared with the CuO powders of each sample by the drop-casting method using 20 mg of the sample in 5 mL of ethanol and sonicated for 15 min.Then, the obtained homogeneous solution was coated drop by drop over a FTO glass with an active area of 1.0 1.0 cm 2 .The prepared film was then annealed at 200 C for 1 h.Chronoamperometry was conducted using Autolab in a 0.1 M NaOH.During the measure, the irradiation source (solar simulator) was turned on for 60 s, off for another 60 s, and repeated in an on-off cycle.The photocurrent produced was recorded for 6 min. CO 2 adsorption tests were performed in an experimental setup previously reported 10.These tests consisted of introducing N 2 through a stainless-steel column for 20 min.Then, a 50-50 mixture of N 2 -CO 2 at 0.4 bar was passed into the column for 30 min at 25 C.Gas chromatography was used to quantify the CO 2 concentration in a Trace 1310 Thermo Scientific equipped with a TCD detector using Helium as a carrier gas. (1) and3 The photocatalytic activity was evaluated in a batch reactor of 250 mL constructed of borosilicate glass at 0.1 bar of CO 2 and room temperature.Two visible-light LED lamps of 20 W were used as a light source.The liquid products (CH 3 OH and HCOH) were measured using the complexation of methanol with sodium nitroprusside and formaldehyde with chromotropic acid 20,21.These methods were validated by our research group by liquid and gas chromatography.The method for CH 3 OH was validated by gas chromatography (GC-FID), and the concentration of HCOH was validated by HPLC.Three consecutive experiments of each sample were performed to estimate the error bars by sample standard deviation. The glass fibers were analyzed by XRF, as is shown in Table 2. SiO 2 was detected as the majority component in GF1 (71) and GF3 (66) substrates.In the GF2 substrate, Cl and CaO were identified as the main components, and SiO 2 was detected in a minor proportion (12).Other compounds were identified in the GF1 (Na 2 O), GF2 (KCl), and GF3 (Al 2 O 3 ) samples.X-ray diffraction was used to identify the crystal phases in the coatings (Fig. 1).CuO monoclinic phase was obtained in all the coatings according to the JCPDS card number 45-0937.An analysis of the broadening of the main reflection at 2 38.68showed that all the samples exhibited small crystallite sizes, which were 5, 4, and 3 nm for CuO deposited on GF1, GF2, and GF3 samples, respectively. Raman analysis was performed to study the CuO coatings over the glass fiber, as shown in Fig. 2. The Raman analysis of Cu/GF1 and Cu/GF2 showed the bands of CuO corresponding to A g (280-290 cm -1 ) 22,23, B g(1) (330-346 cm -1 ) 24,25 and B g(2) (616-620 cm -1 ) modes 25,26.The signal at 516-517 cm -1 can be related to the presence of oxygen vacancies (VOs) on the surface 27.Additionally, in Raman spectra it was possible to identify other bands of compounds in the glass fibers such as: PO 4 3-(1) (960 cm -1 ) 28, Si-N-Si (870 cm -1 ) 29, vibration outside the plane C-H (760 cm -1 ) 29, deformation outside the ring C-H (690 cm -1 ) 29, P-O-P (620 cm -1 ) 28, and doublet K-Cl (390-384 cm -1 ) 30.The bands at 915, 840, and 700 cm -1 were related to the substrate 31.The analysis of Cu/GF3 by this technique was not possible due to its nature, since it was not mechanically stable. The morphology of the coatings was analyzed by scanning electronic microscopy before and after the application of the CuO coatings.The references show a smooth surface with different roughness (Fig. 3a-c), while CuO coatings exhibited different morphologies.In the Cu/GF1 sample (Fig. 3d,g) some bars (1D) were observed, which presented a length of 137 nm and width 440 nm, while in the Cu/GF2 (Fig. 3e,h) and Cu/GF3 samples irregular and agglomerated particles were observed (Fig. 3f,i). To determinate the elemental coating composition in the samples, EDS was analyzed, which results are shown in Table S1.EDS analysis of the CuO coatings indicated that the Cu/GF1 sample exhibited the highest percentage (74) of copper among the studied samples.This could be attributed to the presence of alkaline oxides such as Na 2 O, MgO, and CaO that could act as nucleation points for CuO formation. The morphology of CuO coating of Cu/GF1 was further characterized by TEM and HRTEM analyses.Figure 4a contains a low magnification TEM image of the CuO powder of the CuO coating Cu/GF1.This analysis confirmed the morphology of bars observed by SEM.Also, it was observed that semi-spherical particles formed the bars.Figure 4b shows the lattice resolved HRTEM images.CuO was identified as a single-crystalline phase in this analysis by means of the identification of CuO (200) crystal plane with a d-spacing of 0.22 nm.Other species were not detected through HRTEM analysis, possibly due to their low crystallinity and a low percentage of this phase. The optical diffuse reflectance spectra of CuO coatings were investigated by diffuse reflectance spectroscopy.The bandgap energy of Cu/GFx (x 1,2 and 3) coatings was estimated from the Kubelka-Munk function vs energy photon plot, as is shown in Fig. 5.All the CuO coatings exhibited similar bandgap energy (1.4-1.5 eV).The references showed higher bandgaps ( 3.5 eV) than the coatings, which was attributed to their chemical composition SiO 2 , CaO, MgO, and Al 2 O 3 . The chemical composition of the as-prepared CuO coatings was analyzed by X-ray photoelectron characterization.The Survey of the coatings showed the signals of Cu, O, C, Na, Ca, and the Auger peaks of Cu LMM, Na KLL, O KLL, and C KLL (Figure S1).The C 1s peak was deconvoluted in three peaks at 284.4, 285.5, and 288.4 eV (Fig. 6a,b).These peaks are associated to the C-C, C-O, and CO bonds 10,32,33, which can be attributed to the CO 2 adsorbed from the environment.The Cu 2p spectrum was deconvoluted in two peaks.These signals were attributed to Cu and Cu 2 at 933.1 and 952.2-952.4eV, respectively (Fig. 6c,d) 343536.The Cu 2 peaks and their respective satellites (Cu 2p 3/2 and Cu 2p 1/2 ) at 934.5, 953.8, 961.5, and 962.5 eV for Cu/GF1 and at 934.2, 953.8, 961.5 and 962.5 eV for Cu/GF2.The difference between the main and the satellite peaks was 20 eV, which confirmed the presence of CuO in the coatings 373839.The relative amount of Cu 1 and Cu 2 was quantified using Eq. 1, which results indicated a similar percentage of CuO (46-48) and Cu 2 O (52-54) in the samples.These values were similar because the samples were synthesized at the same conditions using different substrates.The presence of Cu 2 O phase could be attributed to the acetate residues that could reduce Cu 2 to Cu 1 40. On the other hand, the O 1s spectrum of the samples resulted in a broad asymmetric curve, which it was adjusted in four peaks with binding energies at 529.5, 531.1, 532.1, and 533.3 eV for Cu/GF1 and 529.5, 531.1, 531.8 and 533.36 eV for Cu/GF2 (Fig. 6e-f).These peaks are related In the Cu/GF1 sample was analyzed the Na 1s signal, which was deconvoluted in a single peak at 1071.0 eV, characteristic of the Na-O bond present in Na 2 O 50,51 (Fig. 6g). Figure 6h shows the Cl 2p signal in Cu/GF2 sample, which signal was deconvoluted in three bands at 198.4, 199.7, and 201.2 eV, corresponding to the inorganic chlorine bands of Cl 2p 3/2 , KCl, and Cl 2p 1/2 , respectively 52,53. All the CuO coatings exhibited excellent CO 2 capture efficiency, as it is shown in Fig. 7. Particularly the Cu/GF2 sample showed the highest CO 2 adsorption (13.9 mg CO2 cm -2 / 3080 mg CO2 g -1 ).This result can be attributed to the physical and chemical properties of Cu/GF2 sample, i.e., the contribution of the chemical components of the substrate (GF2) and the slit size of the fibers.GF2 substrate showed a high contribution of chloride in its surface, which can act as an electron acceptor of the carbon present in the CO 2 molecule favoring the formation of C-coordinate bonds 7,54,55.Another factor that could contribute to higher CO 2 adsorption in this sample could be its slit size; particularly, a small slit size could favor the contact area between CuO and CO 2 due to the contribution of more active sites, and an increase in the mass transfer inside the adsorption column between CO 2 and the CuO.Additionally, the presence of OVs can be beneficial for the process since they represent active sites for the CO 2 adsorption and its posterior activation and can act as trap charge carriers.Thus, the OVs can influence the activation of CO 2 to CO 2 , which has been identified as the ratelimiting step for photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 56. According to the results, a CO 2 adsorption mechanism in the Cu/GF1 sample was proposed and shown in Fig. 8.In this mechanism, the surface oxygen present on the CuO could act as a Lewis base site.In other words, this active site donates an electron to a carbon in the CO 2 , which promotes the formation of monodentate bonds (carbon coordination bonds) at the CuO surface.In turn, Fig. 8 shows the linear coordination of the oxygen present in CO 2 , which interacts with the Cu of copper oxide.According to the XPS data and Raman spectroscopy, in this sample, OVs were identified, which contributed to that the Cu close to OVs acts as a Lewis acid site by accepting electrons, interacting with oxygen from CO 2 producing CuO-CO species.On the other hand, in Fig. 8, the bidentate coordination bond happens in the interaction of , respectively 10,12. Once the CO 2 was captured on the CuO coatings, the CO 2 utilization was evaluated in the production of liquid solar fuels (CH 3 OH and HCOH) after 1 h of visible LED irradiation.The substrates did not have photocatalytic activity.CuO coatings exhibited photocatalytic activity for CH 3 OH and HCOH generation (Fig. 9).The Cu/GF1 sample exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity (37.6 nmol h -1 cm -2 ) for CH 3 OH production.Regarding to HCOH generation, the Cu/ GF2 sample resulted in the highest photocatalytic activity for HCOH generation of 4.66 nmol cm -2 h -1 followed by Cu/ GF1 (2.7 nmol cm -2 h -1 ) and Cu/GF3 (1.5 nmol cm -2 h -1 ).The product selectivity estimated for CH 3 OH production was higher for Cu/GF1 (93.7).From these data, it was identified some variables that could affect the photocatalytic performance of the CuO coatings: The presence of Na 2 O on the surface of GF1 favored the production of CH 3 OH since this oxide promotes the fixation of CO 2 on the surface of the coating.In addition, this oxide could act as a hole scavenger preventing the re-oxidation of CH 3 OH to HCOH 57. The presence of Cu 2 O in the coatings favored a more efficient transfer of electron-hole in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.This could be related to the position of the conduction band of Cu 2 O that is more negative than CuO 58,59.In this context, electrons (e -) in Cu 2 O are transferred to the conduction band of CuO to favor the conversion of the CO 2 adsorbed, whereas the holes migrate in the opposite direction to oxidize H 2 O to H and O 2 . The presence of VOs on the surface of CuO in the coating favors a higher CO 2 capture. The substrate GF2 that presented Cl on its surface could provide active sites, promoting higher CO 2 adsorption. The low photocatalytic activity obtained with the Cu/ GF3 sample could be attributed to its small slit size that has not favored the interaction with the light radiation. Better dispersion of the copper particles on the surface greatly favored the process of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction. Once the tests for the CCPC process were carried out, the coatings were characterized by XPS, as is shown in Fig. 10.The survey spectra of the Cu/GF2 sample showed the disappearance of chlorine on its surface, which could be attributed to the formation of high toxicity compounds such as chloromethane (CH 3 Cl) during the process.CH 3 Cl could be formed by the methyl radical (CH 3 ) with chlorine radicals (Cl) reaction 60.Therefore, the presence of chloride in the substrate should be avoided to choose an adequate substrate to support bifunctional materials for CCPC applications. Instead, Cu and Na were detected after the photocatalytic reaction by XPS analysis.This can be related to the stability of the Cu/GF1 coating during the CCPC process.An additional band related to C-H bond at 286.2 eV was identified in the XPS spectra of Cu/GF1 sample (Fig. 11a).This band can be attributed to the residual methoxide 61, adsorbed in the surface of copper, possible in the edge sites forming CH 3 O-Cu 2 62.Also, it was possible to detect the disappearance of the signal related to OVs at 531.1 eV (Fig. 11b); while another band at 532.5 eV grew related to the presence of hydroxides, carbonate, or oxygen-containing hydrocarbons 63,64.The band at 934.8 eV on the Cu 2p spectrum could be related to CuCO 3 (Fig. 11c) 65,66. In addition, the presence of the copper carbonate species was calculated with Eq. 1, which results are shown in Table S2.It was possible to observe a decrease of CuO and Cu 2 O species in the samples, which could be related to the carbonation of the copper coating.On the other hand, the stability of the NaO in the coatings was analyzed in the Na1s spectra.As it can be seen in Fig. 11d, a band related to Na-O bond was present in the coatings, which was related to the carbonation of this oxide until the formation of NaCO 3 67,68. To investigate the photoelectrochemical properties of the coatings with the best photocatalytic activity (Cu/GF1 and Cu/GF2), chronoamperometry tests were carried out.Figure 12 shows that all the samples showed a negative photocurrent response and a p-type behavior.The photocurrent density of the CuO photoelectrodes was stable throughout recombination was lower in Cu/GF1 sample (68) than in the Cu/GF2 (77) sample. The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 is a multi-step process. In the first step, the CO The proposed mechanism for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 on the surface of the Cu/GF1 coating is described in Fig. 13.Once the CO 2 is adsorbed on the surface of CuO, probably in the OVs, the photoreduction process begins when the e -produced by Cu 2 O transfer to CO 2 adsorbed on CuO (Fig. 13a).The electron and hole pair travels to the surface of the semiconductor resulting in a set of oxidation-reduction reactions.In this mechanism, the presence of Na 2 O can act as a hole scavenger preventing that the CuO coatings on flexible glass fibers were obtained by a rapid and low-cost microwave-hydrothermal method.The coatings obtained were assessed in the combined process of CO 2 adsorption and its photocatalytic reduction to liquid fuels (CH 3 OH and HCOH) at 25 C. Higher CuO concentration (74 wt), and the presence of Na 2 O in the glass fibers favored both high CO 2 adsorption and high formation of value-adding products.The presence of additional compounds in the substrates such as Na 2 O favored the conversion of the CO 2 -adsorbed on the CuO coatings since it could act as a hole scavenger, preventing the re-oxidation of the products obtained.Also, Na 2 O favored a more efficient charge transfer in the samples, as was evidenced by chronoamperometry tests.On the other hand, the presence of chloride in the fibers could promote the formation of by-products with high toxicity, i.e., CH 3 Cl. CuO coatings showed efficiencies up to 11 higher for the CO 2 capture in comparison with previous reports.This study focused on the importance of combined CO 2 adsorption and its photocatalytic reduction using a hybrid material activated with visible-light.This strategy is beneficial for the design of efficient and stable materials for combined CO 2 capture and photocatalytic reduction.

It should be emphasized that if the photocatalytic capture and reduction of CO 2 is normalized per unit of mass of the material (mg CO2 g -1 and mol g -1 ), the Cu/GF1 sample exhibited efficiencies 50 times higher than others reports summarized in Table 3 1, 4-7, 69, 74-77.Besides, the photocatalytic activity for solar fuel generation was up to 11 times higher CH 3 OH and HCOH more compared to other coatings 77."}, {"llm generation": "Na 2 O", "source": "Higher CuO concentration (74 wt), and the presence of Na 2 O in the glass fibers favored both high CO 2 adsorption and high formation of value-adding products.", "context": "The copper oxide was deposited on three different glass fiber substrates identified as GF1, GF2, and GF3.The glass fiber substrates were bought by local providers.The substrates were cleaned three times using 25 mL of each solvent: acetone, methanol, and deionized water in an ultrasonic bath for 20 min.The substrates used are shown in Table 1.

The morphology of CuO coating of Cu/GF1 was further characterized by TEM and HRTEM analyses.Figure 4a contains a low magnification TEM image of the CuO powder of the CuO coating Cu/GF1.This analysis confirmed the morphology of bars observed by SEM.Also, it was observed that semi-spherical particles formed the bars.Figure 4b shows the lattice resolved HRTEM images.CuO was identified as a single-crystalline phase in this analysis by means of the identification of CuO (200) crystal plane with a d-spacing of 0.22 nm.Other species were not detected through HRTEM analysis, possibly due to their low crystallinity and a low percentage of this phase. The optical diffuse reflectance spectra of CuO coatings were investigated by diffuse reflectance spectroscopy.The bandgap energy of Cu/GFx (x 1,2 and 3) coatings was estimated from the Kubelka-Munk function vs energy photon plot, as is shown in Fig. 5.All the CuO coatings exhibited similar bandgap energy (1.4-1.5 eV).The references showed higher bandgaps ( 3.5 eV) than the coatings, which was attributed to their chemical composition SiO 2 , CaO, MgO, and Al 2 O 3 . The chemical composition of the as-prepared CuO coatings was analyzed by X-ray photoelectron characterization.The Survey of the coatings showed the signals of Cu, O, C, Na, Ca, and the Auger peaks of Cu LMM, Na KLL, O KLL, and C KLL (Figure S1).The C 1s peak was deconvoluted in three peaks at 284.4, 285.5, and 288.4 eV (Fig. 6a,b).These peaks are associated to the C-C, C-O, and CO bonds 10,32,33, which can be attributed to the CO 2 adsorbed from the environment.The Cu 2p spectrum was deconvoluted in two peaks.These signals were attributed to Cu and Cu 2 at 933.1 and 952.2-952.4eV, respectively (Fig. 6c,d) 343536.The Cu 2 peaks and their respective satellites (Cu 2p 3/2 and Cu 2p 1/2 ) at 934.5, 953.8, 961.5, and 962.5 eV for Cu/GF1 and at 934.2, 953.8, 961.5 and 962.5 eV for Cu/GF2.The difference between the main and the satellite peaks was 20 eV, which confirmed the presence of CuO in the coatings 373839.The relative amount of Cu 1 and Cu 2 was quantified using Eq. 1, which results indicated a similar percentage of CuO (46-48) and Cu 2 O (52-54) in the samples.These values were similar because the samples were synthesized at the same conditions using different substrates.The presence of Cu 2 O phase could be attributed to the acetate residues that could reduce Cu 2 to Cu 1 40. On the other hand, the O 1s spectrum of the samples resulted in a broad asymmetric curve, which it was adjusted in four peaks with binding energies at 529.5, 531.1, 532.1, and 533.3 eV for Cu/GF1 and 529.5, 531.1, 531.8 and 533.36 eV for Cu/GF2 (Fig. 6e-f).These peaks are related In the Cu/GF1 sample was analyzed the Na 1s signal, which was deconvoluted in a single peak at 1071.0 eV, characteristic of the Na-O bond present in Na 2 O 50,51 (Fig. 6g). Figure 6h shows the Cl 2p signal in Cu/GF2 sample, which signal was deconvoluted in three bands at 198.4, 199.7, and 201.2 eV, corresponding to the inorganic chlorine bands of Cl 2p 3/2 , KCl, and Cl 2p 1/2 , respectively 52,53. All the CuO coatings exhibited excellent CO 2 capture efficiency, as it is shown in Fig. 7. Particularly the Cu/GF2 sample showed the highest CO 2 adsorption (13.9 mg CO2 cm -2 / 3080 mg CO2 g -1 ).This result can be attributed to the physical and chemical properties of Cu/GF2 sample, i.e., the contribution of the chemical components of the substrate (GF2) and the slit size of the fibers.GF2 substrate showed a high contribution of chloride in its surface, which can act as an electron acceptor of the carbon present in the CO 2 molecule favoring the formation of C-coordinate bonds 7,54,55.Another factor that could contribute to higher CO 2 adsorption in this sample could be its slit size; particularly, a small slit size could favor the contact area between CuO and CO 2 due to the contribution of more active sites, and an increase in the mass transfer inside the adsorption column between CO 2 and the CuO.Additionally, the presence of OVs can be beneficial for the process since they represent active sites for the CO 2 adsorption and its posterior activation and can act as trap charge carriers.Thus, the OVs can influence the activation of CO 2 to CO 2 , which has been identified as the ratelimiting step for photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 56. According to the results, a CO 2 adsorption mechanism in the Cu/GF1 sample was proposed and shown in Fig. 8.In this mechanism, the surface oxygen present on the CuO could act as a Lewis base site.In other words, this active site donates an electron to a carbon in the CO 2 , which promotes the formation of monodentate bonds (carbon coordination bonds) at the CuO surface.In turn, Fig. 8 shows the linear coordination of the oxygen present in CO 2 , which interacts with the Cu of copper oxide.According to the XPS data and Raman spectroscopy, in this sample, OVs were identified, which contributed to that the Cu close to OVs acts as a Lewis acid site by accepting electrons, interacting with oxygen from CO 2 producing CuO-CO species.On the other hand, in Fig. 8, the bidentate coordination bond happens in the interaction of , respectively 10,12. Once the CO 2 was captured on the CuO coatings, the CO 2 utilization was evaluated in the production of liquid solar fuels (CH 3 OH and HCOH) after 1 h of visible LED irradiation.The substrates did not have photocatalytic activity.CuO coatings exhibited photocatalytic activity for CH 3 OH and HCOH generation (Fig. 9).The Cu/GF1 sample exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity (37.6 nmol h -1 cm -2 ) for CH 3 OH production.Regarding to HCOH generation, the Cu/ GF2 sample resulted in the highest photocatalytic activity for HCOH generation of 4.66 nmol cm -2 h -1 followed by Cu/ GF1 (2.7 nmol cm -2 h -1 ) and Cu/GF3 (1.5 nmol cm -2 h -1 ).The product selectivity estimated for CH 3 OH production was higher for Cu/GF1 (93.7).From these data, it was identified some variables that could affect the photocatalytic performance of the CuO coatings: The presence of Na 2 O on the surface of GF1 favored the production of CH 3 OH since this oxide promotes the fixation of CO 2 on the surface of the coating.In addition, this oxide could act as a hole scavenger preventing the re-oxidation of CH 3 OH to HCOH 57. The presence of Cu 2 O in the coatings favored a more efficient transfer of electron-hole in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.This could be related to the position of the conduction band of Cu 2 O that is more negative than CuO 58,59.In this context, electrons (e -) in Cu 2 O are transferred to the conduction band of CuO to favor the conversion of the CO 2 adsorbed, whereas the holes migrate in the opposite direction to oxidize H 2 O to H and O 2 . The presence of VOs on the surface of CuO in the coating favors a higher CO 2 capture. The substrate GF2 that presented Cl on its surface could provide active sites, promoting higher CO 2 adsorption. The low photocatalytic activity obtained with the Cu/ GF3 sample could be attributed to its small slit size that has not favored the interaction with the light radiation. Better dispersion of the copper particles on the surface greatly favored the process of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction. Once the tests for the CCPC process were carried out, the coatings were characterized by XPS, as is shown in Fig. 10.The survey spectra of the Cu/GF2 sample showed the disappearance of chlorine on its surface, which could be attributed to the formation of high toxicity compounds such as chloromethane (CH 3 Cl) during the process.CH 3 Cl could be formed by the methyl radical (CH 3 ) with chlorine radicals (Cl) reaction 60.Therefore, the presence of chloride in the substrate should be avoided to choose an adequate substrate to support bifunctional materials for CCPC applications. Instead, Cu and Na were detected after the photocatalytic reaction by XPS analysis.This can be related to the stability of the Cu/GF1 coating during the CCPC process.An additional band related to C-H bond at 286.2 eV was identified in the XPS spectra of Cu/GF1 sample (Fig. 11a).This band can be attributed to the residual methoxide 61, adsorbed in the surface of copper, possible in the edge sites forming CH 3 O-Cu 2 62.Also, it was possible to detect the disappearance of the signal related to OVs at 531.1 eV (Fig. 11b); while another band at 532.5 eV grew related to the presence of hydroxides, carbonate, or oxygen-containing hydrocarbons 63,64.The band at 934.8 eV on the Cu 2p spectrum could be related to CuCO 3 (Fig. 11c) 65,66. In addition, the presence of the copper carbonate species was calculated with Eq. 1, which results are shown in Table S2.It was possible to observe a decrease of CuO and Cu 2 O species in the samples, which could be related to the carbonation of the copper coating.On the other hand, the stability of the NaO in the coatings was analyzed in the Na1s spectra.As it can be seen in Fig. 11d, a band related to Na-O bond was present in the coatings, which was related to the carbonation of this oxide until the formation of NaCO 3 67,68. To investigate the photoelectrochemical properties of the coatings with the best photocatalytic activity (Cu/GF1 and Cu/GF2), chronoamperometry tests were carried out.Figure 12 shows that all the samples showed a negative photocurrent response and a p-type behavior.The photocurrent density of the CuO photoelectrodes was stable throughout recombination was lower in Cu/GF1 sample (68) than in the Cu/GF2 (77) sample. The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 is a multi-step process. In the first step, the CO The proposed mechanism for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 on the surface of the Cu/GF1 coating is described in Fig. 13.Once the CO 2 is adsorbed on the surface of CuO, probably in the OVs, the photoreduction process begins when the e -produced by Cu 2 O transfer to CO 2 adsorbed on CuO (Fig. 13a).The electron and hole pair travels to the surface of the semiconductor resulting in a set of oxidation-reduction reactions.In this mechanism, the presence of Na 2 O can act as a hole scavenger preventing that the CuO coatings on flexible glass fibers were obtained by a rapid and low-cost microwave-hydrothermal method.The coatings obtained were assessed in the combined process of CO 2 adsorption and its photocatalytic reduction to liquid fuels (CH 3 OH and HCOH) at 25 C. Higher CuO concentration (74 wt), and the presence of Na 2 O in the glass fibers favored both high CO 2 adsorption and high formation of value-adding products.The presence of additional compounds in the substrates such as Na 2 O favored the conversion of the CO 2 -adsorbed on the CuO coatings since it could act as a hole scavenger, preventing the re-oxidation of the products obtained.Also, Na 2 O favored a more efficient charge transfer in the samples, as was evidenced by chronoamperometry tests.On the other hand, the presence of chloride in the fibers could promote the formation of by-products with high toxicity, i.e., CH 3 Cl. CuO coatings showed efficiencies up to 11 higher for the CO 2 capture in comparison with previous reports.This study focused on the importance of combined CO 2 adsorption and its photocatalytic reduction using a hybrid material activated with visible-light.This strategy is beneficial for the design of efficient and stable materials for combined CO 2 capture and photocatalytic reduction.

For the synthesis of CuO coatings, the cleaned substrates were inserted in a cylindrical microwave reactor with 0.38 M of Cu(CH 3 COO) 2 H 2 O (Fermont, 99).This concentration was chosen since it produced high surface area and 1D morphology of CuO, according to previous work 10.The solution obtained was maintained under vigorous stirring for 30 min.Then, NaOH (Fermont, 99) was stoichiometrically added in the first solution.The reactor was irradiated with microwaves in an equipment model Mars 6 at 80 C and 300 W for 1 h.The coatings were washed several times with deionized water to remove the by-products generated during the synthesis.The samples were dried at 80 C overnight and were identified as Cu/GFx, where x denotes the glass fiber used: GF1, GF2, and GF3. The glass fibers were characterized by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) using a Panalytical Epsilon X-ray fluorescence equipment.The crystal phase of the coatings was identified using a diffractometer X-ray Bruker D8 Advance.The crystallite size was estimated employing the Debye-Scherrer's equation 18.The morphology was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy using a microscope model JEOL 6490.For this purpose, the samples were covered with Au-Pd alloy.The surface of the coatings was investigated by Raman spectroscopy using a microscope model Renishaw inVia with 514 nm excitation laser in a range of 200-1000 cm -1 .The surface of the glass fibers and coatings was analyzed using an optical microscope model LUXO 273RB-RLI.The bandgap energy was determinate in a UV-Vis NIR spectrophotometer Cary 5000.This value was estimated by the Kubelka-Munk remission function.X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS) was measured in a Thermo Scientific K-alpha spectrometer with a monochromatic Al X-ray source (19.2 W).C 1s at 284.8 eV was used as a reference to calibrate the photoelectron energy shift.The relative concentrations of copper species (Cu 2 O, CuO and CuCO 3 ) on the coatings were calculated by Eq. 1, in which A X (x 1,2 and 3) is the area of the peaks for the species (A1, A2, A3), while S represents the area of the shake-up photoemission peaks (S1 and S2) 19. The shape and crystal structure of CuO were determined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) using a JEOL 2010 microscope.For TEM characterization, the CuO was suspended on isopropanol.The solution was dropped on 300 mesh Lacey carbon grids and dried under laboratory conditions.It is important to mention that it was not possible to analyze the coating on the glass fiber, since due to its nature, it could detach small microfibers that could damage the TEM filament, so powders of this sample were analyzed. Photocurrent measurements were performed in FTO glass.For this purpose, the working electrode was prepared with the CuO powders of each sample by the drop-casting method using 20 mg of the sample in 5 mL of ethanol and sonicated for 15 min.Then, the obtained homogeneous solution was coated drop by drop over a FTO glass with an active area of 1.0 1.0 cm 2 .The prepared film was then annealed at 200 C for 1 h.Chronoamperometry was conducted using Autolab in a 0.1 M NaOH.During the measure, the irradiation source (solar simulator) was turned on for 60 s, off for another 60 s, and repeated in an on-off cycle.The photocurrent produced was recorded for 6 min. CO 2 adsorption tests were performed in an experimental setup previously reported 10.These tests consisted of introducing N 2 through a stainless-steel column for 20 min.Then, a 50-50 mixture of N 2 -CO 2 at 0.4 bar was passed into the column for 30 min at 25 C.Gas chromatography was used to quantify the CO 2 concentration in a Trace 1310 Thermo Scientific equipped with a TCD detector using Helium as a carrier gas. (1) and3 The photocatalytic activity was evaluated in a batch reactor of 250 mL constructed of borosilicate glass at 0.1 bar of CO 2 and room temperature.Two visible-light LED lamps of 20 W were used as a light source.The liquid products (CH 3 OH and HCOH) were measured using the complexation of methanol with sodium nitroprusside and formaldehyde with chromotropic acid 20,21.These methods were validated by our research group by liquid and gas chromatography.The method for CH 3 OH was validated by gas chromatography (GC-FID), and the concentration of HCOH was validated by HPLC.Three consecutive experiments of each sample were performed to estimate the error bars by sample standard deviation. The glass fibers were analyzed by XRF, as is shown in Table 2. SiO 2 was detected as the majority component in GF1 (71) and GF3 (66) substrates.In the GF2 substrate, Cl and CaO were identified as the main components, and SiO 2 was detected in a minor proportion (12).Other compounds were identified in the GF1 (Na 2 O), GF2 (KCl), and GF3 (Al 2 O 3 ) samples.X-ray diffraction was used to identify the crystal phases in the coatings (Fig. 1).CuO monoclinic phase was obtained in all the coatings according to the JCPDS card number 45-0937.An analysis of the broadening of the main reflection at 2 38.68showed that all the samples exhibited small crystallite sizes, which were 5, 4, and 3 nm for CuO deposited on GF1, GF2, and GF3 samples, respectively. Raman analysis was performed to study the CuO coatings over the glass fiber, as shown in Fig. 2. The Raman analysis of Cu/GF1 and Cu/GF2 showed the bands of CuO corresponding to A g (280-290 cm -1 ) 22,23, B g(1) (330-346 cm -1 ) 24,25 and B g(2) (616-620 cm -1 ) modes 25,26.The signal at 516-517 cm -1 can be related to the presence of oxygen vacancies (VOs) on the surface 27.Additionally, in Raman spectra it was possible to identify other bands of compounds in the glass fibers such as: PO 4 3-(1) (960 cm -1 ) 28, Si-N-Si (870 cm -1 ) 29, vibration outside the plane C-H (760 cm -1 ) 29, deformation outside the ring C-H (690 cm -1 ) 29, P-O-P (620 cm -1 ) 28, and doublet K-Cl (390-384 cm -1 ) 30.The bands at 915, 840, and 700 cm -1 were related to the substrate 31.The analysis of Cu/GF3 by this technique was not possible due to its nature, since it was not mechanically stable. The morphology of the coatings was analyzed by scanning electronic microscopy before and after the application of the CuO coatings.The references show a smooth surface with different roughness (Fig. 3a-c), while CuO coatings exhibited different morphologies.In the Cu/GF1 sample (Fig. 3d,g) some bars (1D) were observed, which presented a length of 137 nm and width 440 nm, while in the Cu/GF2 (Fig. 3e,h) and Cu/GF3 samples irregular and agglomerated particles were observed (Fig. 3f,i). To determinate the elemental coating composition in the samples, EDS was analyzed, which results are shown in Table S1.EDS analysis of the CuO coatings indicated that the Cu/GF1 sample exhibited the highest percentage (74) of copper among the studied samples.This could be attributed to the presence of alkaline oxides such as Na 2 O, MgO, and CaO that could act as nucleation points for CuO formation. The morphology of CuO coating of Cu/GF1 was further characterized by TEM and HRTEM analyses.Figure 4a contains a low magnification TEM image of the CuO powder of the CuO coating Cu/GF1.This analysis confirmed the morphology of bars observed by SEM.Also, it was observed that semi-spherical particles formed the bars.Figure 4b shows the lattice resolved HRTEM images.CuO was identified as a single-crystalline phase in this analysis by means of the identification of CuO (200) crystal plane with a d-spacing of 0.22 nm.Other species were not detected through HRTEM analysis, possibly due to their low crystallinity and a low percentage of this phase. The optical diffuse reflectance spectra of CuO coatings were investigated by diffuse reflectance spectroscopy.The bandgap energy of Cu/GFx (x 1,2 and 3) coatings was estimated from the Kubelka-Munk function vs energy photon plot, as is shown in Fig. 5.All the CuO coatings exhibited similar bandgap energy (1.4-1.5 eV).The references showed higher bandgaps ( 3.5 eV) than the coatings, which was attributed to their chemical composition SiO 2 , CaO, MgO, and Al 2 O 3 . The chemical composition of the as-prepared CuO coatings was analyzed by X-ray photoelectron characterization.The Survey of the coatings showed the signals of Cu, O, C, Na, Ca, and the Auger peaks of Cu LMM, Na KLL, O KLL, and C KLL (Figure S1).The C 1s peak was deconvoluted in three peaks at 284.4, 285.5, and 288.4 eV (Fig. 6a,b).These peaks are associated to the C-C, C-O, and CO bonds 10,32,33, which can be attributed to the CO 2 adsorbed from the environment.The Cu 2p spectrum was deconvoluted in two peaks.These signals were attributed to Cu and Cu 2 at 933.1 and 952.2-952.4eV, respectively (Fig. 6c,d) 343536.The Cu 2 peaks and their respective satellites (Cu 2p 3/2 and Cu 2p 1/2 ) at 934.5, 953.8, 961.5, and 962.5 eV for Cu/GF1 and at 934.2, 953.8, 961.5 and 962.5 eV for Cu/GF2.The difference between the main and the satellite peaks was 20 eV, which confirmed the presence of CuO in the coatings 373839.The relative amount of Cu 1 and Cu 2 was quantified using Eq. 1, which results indicated a similar percentage of CuO (46-48) and Cu 2 O (52-54) in the samples.These values were similar because the samples were synthesized at the same conditions using different substrates.The presence of Cu 2 O phase could be attributed to the acetate residues that could reduce Cu 2 to Cu 1 40. On the other hand, the O 1s spectrum of the samples resulted in a broad asymmetric curve, which it was adjusted in four peaks with binding energies at 529.5, 531.1, 532.1, and 533.3 eV for Cu/GF1 and 529.5, 531.1, 531.8 and 533.36 eV for Cu/GF2 (Fig. 6e-f).These peaks are related In the Cu/GF1 sample was analyzed the Na 1s signal, which was deconvoluted in a single peak at 1071.0 eV, characteristic of the Na-O bond present in Na 2 O 50,51 (Fig. 6g). Figure 6h shows the Cl 2p signal in Cu/GF2 sample, which signal was deconvoluted in three bands at 198.4, 199.7, and 201.2 eV, corresponding to the inorganic chlorine bands of Cl 2p 3/2 , KCl, and Cl 2p 1/2 , respectively 52,53. All the CuO coatings exhibited excellent CO 2 capture efficiency, as it is shown in Fig. 7. Particularly the Cu/GF2 sample showed the highest CO 2 adsorption (13.9 mg CO2 cm -2 / 3080 mg CO2 g -1 ).This result can be attributed to the physical and chemical properties of Cu/GF2 sample, i.e., the contribution of the chemical components of the substrate (GF2) and the slit size of the fibers.GF2 substrate showed a high contribution of chloride in its surface, which can act as an electron acceptor of the carbon present in the CO 2 molecule favoring the formation of C-coordinate bonds 7,54,55.Another factor that could contribute to higher CO 2 adsorption in this sample could be its slit size; particularly, a small slit size could favor the contact area between CuO and CO 2 due to the contribution of more active sites, and an increase in the mass transfer inside the adsorption column between CO 2 and the CuO.Additionally, the presence of OVs can be beneficial for the process since they represent active sites for the CO 2 adsorption and its posterior activation and can act as trap charge carriers.Thus, the OVs can influence the activation of CO 2 to CO 2 , which has been identified as the ratelimiting step for photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 56. According to the results, a CO 2 adsorption mechanism in the Cu/GF1 sample was proposed and shown in Fig. 8.In this mechanism, the surface oxygen present on the CuO could act as a Lewis base site.In other words, this active site donates an electron to a carbon in the CO 2 , which promotes the formation of monodentate bonds (carbon coordination bonds) at the CuO surface.In turn, Fig. 8 shows the linear coordination of the oxygen present in CO 2 , which interacts with the Cu of copper oxide.According to the XPS data and Raman spectroscopy, in this sample, OVs were identified, which contributed to that the Cu close to OVs acts as a Lewis acid site by accepting electrons, interacting with oxygen from CO 2 producing CuO-CO species.On the other hand, in Fig. 8, the bidentate coordination bond happens in the interaction of , respectively 10,12. Once the CO 2 was captured on the CuO coatings, the CO 2 utilization was evaluated in the production of liquid solar fuels (CH 3 OH and HCOH) after 1 h of visible LED irradiation.The substrates did not have photocatalytic activity.CuO coatings exhibited photocatalytic activity for CH 3 OH and HCOH generation (Fig. 9).The Cu/GF1 sample exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity (37.6 nmol h -1 cm -2 ) for CH 3 OH production.Regarding to HCOH generation, the Cu/ GF2 sample resulted in the highest photocatalytic activity for HCOH generation of 4.66 nmol cm -2 h -1 followed by Cu/ GF1 (2.7 nmol cm -2 h -1 ) and Cu/GF3 (1.5 nmol cm -2 h -1 ).The product selectivity estimated for CH 3 OH production was higher for Cu/GF1 (93.7).From these data, it was identified some variables that could affect the photocatalytic performance of the CuO coatings: The presence of Na 2 O on the surface of GF1 favored the production of CH 3 OH since this oxide promotes the fixation of CO 2 on the surface of the coating.In addition, this oxide could act as a hole scavenger preventing the re-oxidation of CH 3 OH to HCOH 57. The presence of Cu 2 O in the coatings favored a more efficient transfer of electron-hole in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.This could be related to the position of the conduction band of Cu 2 O that is more negative than CuO 58,59.In this context, electrons (e -) in Cu 2 O are transferred to the conduction band of CuO to favor the conversion of the CO 2 adsorbed, whereas the holes migrate in the opposite direction to oxidize H 2 O to H and O 2 . The presence of VOs on the surface of CuO in the coating favors a higher CO 2 capture. The substrate GF2 that presented Cl on its surface could provide active sites, promoting higher CO 2 adsorption. The low photocatalytic activity obtained with the Cu/ GF3 sample could be attributed to its small slit size that has not favored the interaction with the light radiation. Better dispersion of the copper particles on the surface greatly favored the process of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction. Once the tests for the CCPC process were carried out, the coatings were characterized by XPS, as is shown in Fig. 10.The survey spectra of the Cu/GF2 sample showed the disappearance of chlorine on its surface, which could be attributed to the formation of high toxicity compounds such as chloromethane (CH 3 Cl) during the process.CH 3 Cl could be formed by the methyl radical (CH 3 ) with chlorine radicals (Cl) reaction 60.Therefore, the presence of chloride in the substrate should be avoided to choose an adequate substrate to support bifunctional materials for CCPC applications. Instead, Cu and Na were detected after the photocatalytic reaction by XPS analysis.This can be related to the stability of the Cu/GF1 coating during the CCPC process.An additional band related to C-H bond at 286.2 eV was identified in the XPS spectra of Cu/GF1 sample (Fig. 11a).This band can be attributed to the residual methoxide 61, adsorbed in the surface of copper, possible in the edge sites forming CH 3 O-Cu 2 62.Also, it was possible to detect the disappearance of the signal related to OVs at 531.1 eV (Fig. 11b); while another band at 532.5 eV grew related to the presence of hydroxides, carbonate, or oxygen-containing hydrocarbons 63,64.The band at 934.8 eV on the Cu 2p spectrum could be related to CuCO 3 (Fig. 11c) 65,66. In addition, the presence of the copper carbonate species was calculated with Eq. 1, which results are shown in Table S2.It was possible to observe a decrease of CuO and Cu 2 O species in the samples, which could be related to the carbonation of the copper coating.On the other hand, the stability of the NaO in the coatings was analyzed in the Na1s spectra.As it can be seen in Fig. 11d, a band related to Na-O bond was present in the coatings, which was related to the carbonation of this oxide until the formation of NaCO 3 67,68. To investigate the photoelectrochemical properties of the coatings with the best photocatalytic activity (Cu/GF1 and Cu/GF2), chronoamperometry tests were carried out.Figure 12 shows that all the samples showed a negative photocurrent response and a p-type behavior.The photocurrent density of the CuO photoelectrodes was stable throughout recombination was lower in Cu/GF1 sample (68) than in the Cu/GF2 (77) sample. The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 is a multi-step process. In the first step, the CO The proposed mechanism for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 on the surface of the Cu/GF1 coating is described in Fig. 13.Once the CO 2 is adsorbed on the surface of CuO, probably in the OVs, the photoreduction process begins when the e -produced by Cu 2 O transfer to CO 2 adsorbed on CuO (Fig. 13a).The electron and hole pair travels to the surface of the semiconductor resulting in a set of oxidation-reduction reactions.In this mechanism, the presence of Na 2 O can act as a hole scavenger preventing that the CuO coatings on flexible glass fibers were obtained by a rapid and low-cost microwave-hydrothermal method.The coatings obtained were assessed in the combined process of CO 2 adsorption and its photocatalytic reduction to liquid fuels (CH 3 OH and HCOH) at 25 C. Higher CuO concentration (74 wt), and the presence of Na 2 O in the glass fibers favored both high CO 2 adsorption and high formation of value-adding products.The presence of additional compounds in the substrates such as Na 2 O favored the conversion of the CO 2 -adsorbed on the CuO coatings since it could act as a hole scavenger, preventing the re-oxidation of the products obtained.Also, Na 2 O favored a more efficient charge transfer in the samples, as was evidenced by chronoamperometry tests.On the other hand, the presence of chloride in the fibers could promote the formation of by-products with high toxicity, i.e., CH 3 Cl. CuO coatings showed efficiencies up to 11 higher for the CO 2 capture in comparison with previous reports.This study focused on the importance of combined CO 2 adsorption and its photocatalytic reduction using a hybrid material activated with visible-light.This strategy is beneficial for the design of efficient and stable materials for combined CO 2 capture and photocatalytic reduction.

It should be emphasized that if the photocatalytic capture and reduction of CO 2 is normalized per unit of mass of the material (mg CO2 g -1 and mol g -1 ), the Cu/GF1 sample exhibited efficiencies 50 times higher than others reports summarized in Table 3 1, 4-7, 69, 74-77.Besides, the photocatalytic activity for solar fuel generation was up to 11 times higher CH 3 OH and HCOH more compared to other coatings 77."}, {"llm generation": "LED", "source": "Once the CO 2 was captured on the CuO coatings, the CO 2 utilization was evaluated in the production of liquid solar fuels (CH 3 OH and HCOH) after 1 h of visible LED irradiation.", "context": "The glass fibers were analyzed by XRF, as is shown in Table 2. SiO 2 was detected as the majority component in GF1 (71) and GF3 (66) substrates.In the GF2 substrate, Cl and CaO were identified as the main components, and SiO 2 was detected in a minor proportion (12).Other compounds were identified in the GF1 (Na 2 O), GF2 (KCl), and GF3 (Al 2 O 3 ) samples.X-ray diffraction was used to identify the crystal phases in the coatings (Fig. 1).CuO monoclinic phase was obtained in all the coatings according to the JCPDS card number 45-0937.An analysis of the broadening of the main reflection at 2 38.68showed that all the samples exhibited small crystallite sizes, which were 5, 4, and 3 nm for CuO deposited on GF1, GF2, and GF3 samples, respectively. Raman analysis was performed to study the CuO coatings over the glass fiber, as shown in Fig. 2. The Raman analysis of Cu/GF1 and Cu/GF2 showed the bands of CuO corresponding to A g (280-290 cm -1 ) 22,23, B g(1) (330-346 cm -1 ) 24,25 and B g(2) (616-620 cm -1 ) modes 25,26.The signal at 516-517 cm -1 can be related to the presence of oxygen vacancies (VOs) on the surface 27.Additionally, in Raman spectra it was possible to identify other bands of compounds in the glass fibers such as: PO 4 3-(1) (960 cm -1 ) 28, Si-N-Si (870 cm -1 ) 29, vibration outside the plane C-H (760 cm -1 ) 29, deformation outside the ring C-H (690 cm -1 ) 29, P-O-P (620 cm -1 ) 28, and doublet K-Cl (390-384 cm -1 ) 30.The bands at 915, 840, and 700 cm -1 were related to the substrate 31.The analysis of Cu/GF3 by this technique was not possible due to its nature, since it was not mechanically stable. The morphology of the coatings was analyzed by scanning electronic microscopy before and after the application of the CuO coatings.The references show a smooth surface with different roughness (Fig. 3a-c), while CuO coatings exhibited different morphologies.In the Cu/GF1 sample (Fig. 3d,g) some bars (1D) were observed, which presented a length of 137 nm and width 440 nm, while in the Cu/GF2 (Fig. 3e,h) and Cu/GF3 samples irregular and agglomerated particles were observed (Fig. 3f,i). To determinate the elemental coating composition in the samples, EDS was analyzed, which results are shown in Table S1.EDS analysis of the CuO coatings indicated that the Cu/GF1 sample exhibited the highest percentage (74) of copper among the studied samples.This could be attributed to the presence of alkaline oxides such as Na 2 O, MgO, and CaO that could act as nucleation points for CuO formation.

The optical diffuse reflectance spectra of CuO coatings were investigated by diffuse reflectance spectroscopy.The bandgap energy of Cu/GFx (x 1,2 and 3) coatings was estimated from the Kubelka-Munk function vs energy photon plot, as is shown in Fig. 5.All the CuO coatings exhibited similar bandgap energy (1.4-1.5 eV).The references showed higher bandgaps ( 3.5 eV) than the coatings, which was attributed to their chemical composition SiO 2 , CaO, MgO, and Al 2 O 3 .

On the other hand, the O 1s spectrum of the samples resulted in a broad asymmetric curve, which it was adjusted in four peaks with binding energies at 529.5, 531.1, 532.1, and 533.3 eV for Cu/GF1 and 529.5, 531.1, 531.8 and 533.36 eV for Cu/GF2 (Fig. 6e-f).These peaks are related In the Cu/GF1 sample was analyzed the Na 1s signal, which was deconvoluted in a single peak at 1071.0 eV, characteristic of the Na-O bond present in Na 2 O 50,51 (Fig. 6g). Figure 6h shows the Cl 2p signal in Cu/GF2 sample, which signal was deconvoluted in three bands at 198.4, 199.7, and 201.2 eV, corresponding to the inorganic chlorine bands of Cl 2p 3/2 , KCl, and Cl 2p 1/2 , respectively 52,53. All the CuO coatings exhibited excellent CO 2 capture efficiency, as it is shown in Fig. 7. Particularly the Cu/GF2 sample showed the highest CO 2 adsorption (13.9 mg CO2 cm -2 / 3080 mg CO2 g -1 ).This result can be attributed to the physical and chemical properties of Cu/GF2 sample, i.e., the contribution of the chemical components of the substrate (GF2) and the slit size of the fibers.GF2 substrate showed a high contribution of chloride in its surface, which can act as an electron acceptor of the carbon present in the CO 2 molecule favoring the formation of C-coordinate bonds 7,54,55.Another factor that could contribute to higher CO 2 adsorption in this sample could be its slit size; particularly, a small slit size could favor the contact area between CuO and CO 2 due to the contribution of more active sites, and an increase in the mass transfer inside the adsorption column between CO 2 and the CuO.Additionally, the presence of OVs can be beneficial for the process since they represent active sites for the CO 2 adsorption and its posterior activation and can act as trap charge carriers.Thus, the OVs can influence the activation of CO 2 to CO 2 , which has been identified as the ratelimiting step for photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 56.

In addition, the presence of the copper carbonate species was calculated with Eq. 1, which results are shown in Table S2.It was possible to observe a decrease of CuO and Cu 2 O species in the samples, which could be related to the carbonation of the copper coating.On the other hand, the stability of the NaO in the coatings was analyzed in the Na1s spectra.As it can be seen in Fig. 11d, a band related to Na-O bond was present in the coatings, which was related to the carbonation of this oxide until the formation of NaCO 3 67,68. To investigate the photoelectrochemical properties of the coatings with the best photocatalytic activity (Cu/GF1 and Cu/GF2), chronoamperometry tests were carried out.Figure 12 shows that all the samples showed a negative photocurrent response and a p-type behavior.The photocurrent density of the CuO photoelectrodes was stable throughout recombination was lower in Cu/GF1 sample (68) than in the Cu/GF2 (77) sample. The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 is a multi-step process. In the first step, the CO The proposed mechanism for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 on the surface of the Cu/GF1 coating is described in Fig. 13.Once the CO 2 is adsorbed on the surface of CuO, probably in the OVs, the photoreduction process begins when the e -produced by Cu 2 O transfer to CO 2 adsorbed on CuO (Fig. 13a).The electron and hole pair travels to the surface of the semiconductor resulting in a set of oxidation-reduction reactions.In this mechanism, the presence of Na 2 O can act as a hole scavenger preventing that the"}], "reaction medium": [{"llm generation": "Gas", "source": "Once the CO 2 was adsorbed, the coatings were exposed to visible LED light to carry out its conversion to solar fuels (CH 3 OH and HCOH).", "context": "The CO 2 capture and its photocatalytic conversion (CCPC) to solar fuels is one promising route to fighting global warming.The CCPC process implies the use of CO 2 , solar light, and materials to produce solar fuels of low carbon content.The materials must fulfill with the double function of capture and photocatalytic convert of the CO 2 into solar fuels.For this purpose, copper oxide (CuO) is an excellent candidate to act as both: adsorbent and photocatalyst.Scaling-up the CCPC process requires the immobilization of CuO on commercially available substrates such as glass fibers, which offers a homogeneous surface exposure, efficient absorption of solar energy, and an easy application in reactors.In this work, the fabrication of CuO coatings on glass fibers by a simple microwave-hydrothermal method to produce solar fuels (CH 3 OH and HCOH) in CCPC process is proposed.Three glass fibers with different chemical compositions and slit (open area) were selected as supports.The best efficiency for CO 2 capture (3080 mg CO2 g -1 ) was obtained with the CuO coating deposited in a substrate rich in Na 2 O and CaO.Once the CO 2 was adsorbed, the coatings were exposed to visible LED light to carry out its conversion to solar fuels (CH 3 OH and HCOH).According to the results, both high CuO content and high slits in the fibers promoted an increase in the CO 2 conversion to HCOH (2.7 nmol cm -2 h -1 ) and CH 3 OH (37.6 nmol h -1 cm -2 ).The presence of Na 2 O in the substrates played an essential role as a hole scavenger in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, preventing the re-oxidation of the products.The use of glass fibers as support of CuO promoted efficiencies up to 11 times higher than other materials used in CCPC process."}], "reactor type": [], "operation mode": [{"llm generation": "Batch", "source": "The photocatalytic activity was evaluated in a batch reactor of 250 mL constructed of borosilicate glass at 0.1 bar of CO 2 and room temperature.", "context": "The copper oxide was deposited on three different glass fiber substrates identified as GF1, GF2, and GF3.The glass fiber substrates were bought by local providers.The substrates were cleaned three times using 25 mL of each solvent: acetone, methanol, and deionized water in an ultrasonic bath for 20 min.The substrates used are shown in Table 1. For the synthesis of CuO coatings, the cleaned substrates were inserted in a cylindrical microwave reactor with 0.38 M of Cu(CH 3 COO) 2 H 2 O (Fermont, 99).This concentration was chosen since it produced high surface area and 1D morphology of CuO, according to previous work 10.The solution obtained was maintained under vigorous stirring for 30 min.Then, NaOH (Fermont, 99) was stoichiometrically added in the first solution.The reactor was irradiated with microwaves in an equipment model Mars 6 at 80 C and 300 W for 1 h.The coatings were washed several times with deionized water to remove the by-products generated during the synthesis.The samples were dried at 80 C overnight and were identified as Cu/GFx, where x denotes the glass fiber used: GF1, GF2, and GF3. The glass fibers were characterized by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) using a Panalytical Epsilon X-ray fluorescence equipment.The crystal phase of the coatings was identified using a diffractometer X-ray Bruker D8 Advance.The crystallite size was estimated employing the Debye-Scherrer's equation 18.The morphology was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy using a microscope model JEOL 6490.For this purpose, the samples were covered with Au-Pd alloy.The surface of the coatings was investigated by Raman spectroscopy using a microscope model Renishaw inVia with 514 nm excitation laser in a range of 200-1000 cm -1 .The surface of the glass fibers and coatings was analyzed using an optical microscope model LUXO 273RB-RLI.The bandgap energy was determinate in a UV-Vis NIR spectrophotometer Cary 5000.This value was estimated by the Kubelka-Munk remission function.X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS) was measured in a Thermo Scientific K-alpha spectrometer with a monochromatic Al X-ray source (19.2 W).C 1s at 284.8 eV was used as a reference to calibrate the photoelectron energy shift.The relative concentrations of copper species (Cu 2 O, CuO and CuCO 3 ) on the coatings were calculated by Eq. 1, in which A X (x 1,2 and 3) is the area of the peaks for the species (A1, A2, A3), while S represents the area of the shake-up photoemission peaks (S1 and S2) 19. The shape and crystal structure of CuO were determined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) using a JEOL 2010 microscope.For TEM characterization, the CuO was suspended on isopropanol.The solution was dropped on 300 mesh Lacey carbon grids and dried under laboratory conditions.It is important to mention that it was not possible to analyze the coating on the glass fiber, since due to its nature, it could detach small microfibers that could damage the TEM filament, so powders of this sample were analyzed. Photocurrent measurements were performed in FTO glass.For this purpose, the working electrode was prepared with the CuO powders of each sample by the drop-casting method using 20 mg of the sample in 5 mL of ethanol and sonicated for 15 min.Then, the obtained homogeneous solution was coated drop by drop over a FTO glass with an active area of 1.0 1.0 cm 2 .The prepared film was then annealed at 200 C for 1 h.Chronoamperometry was conducted using Autolab in a 0.1 M NaOH.During the measure, the irradiation source (solar simulator) was turned on for 60 s, off for another 60 s, and repeated in an on-off cycle.The photocurrent produced was recorded for 6 min. CO 2 adsorption tests were performed in an experimental setup previously reported 10.These tests consisted of introducing N 2 through a stainless-steel column for 20 min.Then, a 50-50 mixture of N 2 -CO 2 at 0.4 bar was passed into the column for 30 min at 25 C.Gas chromatography was used to quantify the CO 2 concentration in a Trace 1310 Thermo Scientific equipped with a TCD detector using Helium as a carrier gas. (1) and3 The photocatalytic activity was evaluated in a batch reactor of 250 mL constructed of borosilicate glass at 0.1 bar of CO 2 and room temperature.Two visible-light LED lamps of 20 W were used as a light source.The liquid products (CH 3 OH and HCOH) were measured using the complexation of methanol with sodium nitroprusside and formaldehyde with chromotropic acid 20,21.These methods were validated by our research group by liquid and gas chromatography.The method for CH 3 OH was validated by gas chromatography (GC-FID), and the concentration of HCOH was validated by HPLC.Three consecutive experiments of each sample were performed to estimate the error bars by sample standard deviation. The glass fibers were analyzed by XRF, as is shown in Table 2. SiO 2 was detected as the majority component in GF1 (71) and GF3 (66) substrates.In the GF2 substrate, Cl and CaO were identified as the main components, and SiO 2 was detected in a minor proportion (12).Other compounds were identified in the GF1 (Na 2 O), GF2 (KCl), and GF3 (Al 2 O 3 ) samples.X-ray diffraction was used to identify the crystal phases in the coatings (Fig. 1).CuO monoclinic phase was obtained in all the coatings according to the JCPDS card number 45-0937.An analysis of the broadening of the main reflection at 2 38.68showed that all the samples exhibited small crystallite sizes, which were 5, 4, and 3 nm for CuO deposited on GF1, GF2, and GF3 samples, respectively. Raman analysis was performed to study the CuO coatings over the glass fiber, as shown in Fig. 2. The Raman analysis of Cu/GF1 and Cu/GF2 showed the bands of CuO corresponding to A g (280-290 cm -1 ) 22,23, B g(1) (330-346 cm -1 ) 24,25 and B g(2) (616-620 cm -1 ) modes 25,26.The signal at 516-517 cm -1 can be related to the presence of oxygen vacancies (VOs) on the surface 27.Additionally, in Raman spectra it was possible to identify other bands of compounds in the glass fibers such as: PO 4 3-(1) (960 cm -1 ) 28, Si-N-Si (870 cm -1 ) 29, vibration outside the plane C-H (760 cm -1 ) 29, deformation outside the ring C-H (690 cm -1 ) 29, P-O-P (620 cm -1 ) 28, and doublet K-Cl (390-384 cm -1 ) 30.The bands at 915, 840, and 700 cm -1 were related to the substrate 31.The analysis of Cu/GF3 by this technique was not possible due to its nature, since it was not mechanically stable. The morphology of the coatings was analyzed by scanning electronic microscopy before and after the application of the CuO coatings.The references show a smooth surface with different roughness (Fig. 3a-c), while CuO coatings exhibited different morphologies.In the Cu/GF1 sample (Fig. 3d,g) some bars (1D) were observed, which presented a length of 137 nm and width 440 nm, while in the Cu/GF2 (Fig. 3e,h) and Cu/GF3 samples irregular and agglomerated particles were observed (Fig. 3f,i). To determinate the elemental coating composition in the samples, EDS was analyzed, which results are shown in Table S1.EDS analysis of the CuO coatings indicated that the Cu/GF1 sample exhibited the highest percentage (74) of copper among the studied samples.This could be attributed to the presence of alkaline oxides such as Na 2 O, MgO, and CaO that could act as nucleation points for CuO formation. The morphology of CuO coating of Cu/GF1 was further characterized by TEM and HRTEM analyses.Figure 4a contains a low magnification TEM image of the CuO powder of the CuO coating Cu/GF1.This analysis confirmed the morphology of bars observed by SEM.Also, it was observed that semi-spherical particles formed the bars.Figure 4b shows the lattice resolved HRTEM images.CuO was identified as a single-crystalline phase in this analysis by means of the identification of CuO (200) crystal plane with a d-spacing of 0.22 nm.Other species were not detected through HRTEM analysis, possibly due to their low crystallinity and a low percentage of this phase. The optical diffuse reflectance spectra of CuO coatings were investigated by diffuse reflectance spectroscopy.The bandgap energy of Cu/GFx (x 1,2 and 3) coatings was estimated from the Kubelka-Munk function vs energy photon plot, as is shown in Fig. 5.All the CuO coatings exhibited similar bandgap energy (1.4-1.5 eV).The references showed higher bandgaps ( 3.5 eV) than the coatings, which was attributed to their chemical composition SiO 2 , CaO, MgO, and Al 2 O 3 . The chemical composition of the as-prepared CuO coatings was analyzed by X-ray photoelectron characterization.The Survey of the coatings showed the signals of Cu, O, C, Na, Ca, and the Auger peaks of Cu LMM, Na KLL, O KLL, and C KLL (Figure S1).The C 1s peak was deconvoluted in three peaks at 284.4, 285.5, and 288.4 eV (Fig. 6a,b).These peaks are associated to the C-C, C-O, and CO bonds 10,32,33, which can be attributed to the CO 2 adsorbed from the environment.The Cu 2p spectrum was deconvoluted in two peaks.These signals were attributed to Cu and Cu 2 at 933.1 and 952.2-952.4eV, respectively (Fig. 6c,d) 343536.The Cu 2 peaks and their respective satellites (Cu 2p 3/2 and Cu 2p 1/2 ) at 934.5, 953.8, 961.5, and 962.5 eV for Cu/GF1 and at 934.2, 953.8, 961.5 and 962.5 eV for Cu/GF2.The difference between the main and the satellite peaks was 20 eV, which confirmed the presence of CuO in the coatings 373839.The relative amount of Cu 1 and Cu 2 was quantified using Eq. 1, which results indicated a similar percentage of CuO (46-48) and Cu 2 O (52-54) in the samples.These values were similar because the samples were synthesized at the same conditions using different substrates.The presence of Cu 2 O phase could be attributed to the acetate residues that could reduce Cu 2 to Cu 1 40. On the other hand, the O 1s spectrum of the samples resulted in a broad asymmetric curve, which it was adjusted in four peaks with binding energies at 529.5, 531.1, 532.1, and 533.3 eV for Cu/GF1 and 529.5, 531.1, 531.8 and 533.36 eV for Cu/GF2 (Fig. 6e-f).These peaks are related In the Cu/GF1 sample was analyzed the Na 1s signal, which was deconvoluted in a single peak at 1071.0 eV, characteristic of the Na-O bond present in Na 2 O 50,51 (Fig. 6g). Figure 6h shows the Cl 2p signal in Cu/GF2 sample, which signal was deconvoluted in three bands at 198.4, 199.7, and 201.2 eV, corresponding to the inorganic chlorine bands of Cl 2p 3/2 , KCl, and Cl 2p 1/2 , respectively 52,53. All the CuO coatings exhibited excellent CO 2 capture efficiency, as it is shown in Fig. 7. Particularly the Cu/GF2 sample showed the highest CO 2 adsorption (13.9 mg CO2 cm -2 / 3080 mg CO2 g -1 ).This result can be attributed to the physical and chemical properties of Cu/GF2 sample, i.e., the contribution of the chemical components of the substrate (GF2) and the slit size of the fibers.GF2 substrate showed a high contribution of chloride in its surface, which can act as an electron acceptor of the carbon present in the CO 2 molecule favoring the formation of C-coordinate bonds 7,54,55.Another factor that could contribute to higher CO 2 adsorption in this sample could be its slit size; particularly, a small slit size could favor the contact area between CuO and CO 2 due to the contribution of more active sites, and an increase in the mass transfer inside the adsorption column between CO 2 and the CuO.Additionally, the presence of OVs can be beneficial for the process since they represent active sites for the CO 2 adsorption and its posterior activation and can act as trap charge carriers.Thus, the OVs can influence the activation of CO 2 to CO 2 , which has been identified as the ratelimiting step for photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 56. According to the results, a CO 2 adsorption mechanism in the Cu/GF1 sample was proposed and shown in Fig. 8.In this mechanism, the surface oxygen present on the CuO could act as a Lewis base site.In other words, this active site donates an electron to a carbon in the CO 2 , which promotes the formation of monodentate bonds (carbon coordination bonds) at the CuO surface.In turn, Fig. 8 shows the linear coordination of the oxygen present in CO 2 , which interacts with the Cu of copper oxide.According to the XPS data and Raman spectroscopy, in this sample, OVs were identified, which contributed to that the Cu close to OVs acts as a Lewis acid site by accepting electrons, interacting with oxygen from CO 2 producing CuO-CO species.On the other hand, in Fig. 8, the bidentate coordination bond happens in the interaction of , respectively 10,12. Once the CO 2 was captured on the CuO coatings, the CO 2 utilization was evaluated in the production of liquid solar fuels (CH 3 OH and HCOH) after 1 h of visible LED irradiation.The substrates did not have photocatalytic activity.CuO coatings exhibited photocatalytic activity for CH 3 OH and HCOH generation (Fig. 9).The Cu/GF1 sample exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity (37.6 nmol h -1 cm -2 ) for CH 3 OH production.Regarding to HCOH generation, the Cu/ GF2 sample resulted in the highest photocatalytic activity for HCOH generation of 4.66 nmol cm -2 h -1 followed by Cu/ GF1 (2.7 nmol cm -2 h -1 ) and Cu/GF3 (1.5 nmol cm -2 h -1 ).The product selectivity estimated for CH 3 OH production was higher for Cu/GF1 (93.7).From these data, it was identified some variables that could affect the photocatalytic performance of the CuO coatings: The presence of Na 2 O on the surface of GF1 favored the production of CH 3 OH since this oxide promotes the fixation of CO 2 on the surface of the coating.In addition, this oxide could act as a hole scavenger preventing the re-oxidation of CH 3 OH to HCOH 57. The presence of Cu 2 O in the coatings favored a more efficient transfer of electron-hole in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.This could be related to the position of the conduction band of Cu 2 O that is more negative than CuO 58,59.In this context, electrons (e -) in Cu 2 O are transferred to the conduction band of CuO to favor the conversion of the CO 2 adsorbed, whereas the holes migrate in the opposite direction to oxidize H 2 O to H and O 2 . The presence of VOs on the surface of CuO in the coating favors a higher CO 2 capture. The substrate GF2 that presented Cl on its surface could provide active sites, promoting higher CO 2 adsorption. The low photocatalytic activity obtained with the Cu/ GF3 sample could be attributed to its small slit size that has not favored the interaction with the light radiation. Better dispersion of the copper particles on the surface greatly favored the process of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction. Once the tests for the CCPC process were carried out, the coatings were characterized by XPS, as is shown in Fig. 10.The survey spectra of the Cu/GF2 sample showed the disappearance of chlorine on its surface, which could be attributed to the formation of high toxicity compounds such as chloromethane (CH 3 Cl) during the process.CH 3 Cl could be formed by the methyl radical (CH 3 ) with chlorine radicals (Cl) reaction 60.Therefore, the presence of chloride in the substrate should be avoided to choose an adequate substrate to support bifunctional materials for CCPC applications. Instead, Cu and Na were detected after the photocatalytic reaction by XPS analysis.This can be related to the stability of the Cu/GF1 coating during the CCPC process.An additional band related to C-H bond at 286.2 eV was identified in the XPS spectra of Cu/GF1 sample (Fig. 11a).This band can be attributed to the residual methoxide 61, adsorbed in the surface of copper, possible in the edge sites forming CH 3 O-Cu 2 62.Also, it was possible to detect the disappearance of the signal related to OVs at 531.1 eV (Fig. 11b); while another band at 532.5 eV grew related to the presence of hydroxides, carbonate, or oxygen-containing hydrocarbons 63,64.The band at 934.8 eV on the Cu 2p spectrum could be related to CuCO 3 (Fig. 11c) 65,66. In addition, the presence of the copper carbonate species was calculated with Eq. 1, which results are shown in Table S2.It was possible to observe a decrease of CuO and Cu 2 O species in the samples, which could be related to the carbonation of the copper coating.On the other hand, the stability of the NaO in the coatings was analyzed in the Na1s spectra.As it can be seen in Fig. 11d, a band related to Na-O bond was present in the coatings, which was related to the carbonation of this oxide until the formation of NaCO 3 67,68. To investigate the photoelectrochemical properties of the coatings with the best photocatalytic activity (Cu/GF1 and Cu/GF2), chronoamperometry tests were carried out.Figure 12 shows that all the samples showed a negative photocurrent response and a p-type behavior.The photocurrent density of the CuO photoelectrodes was stable throughout recombination was lower in Cu/GF1 sample (68) than in the Cu/GF2 (77) sample. The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 is a multi-step process. In the first step, the CO The proposed mechanism for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 on the surface of the Cu/GF1 coating is described in Fig. 13.Once the CO 2 is adsorbed on the surface of CuO, probably in the OVs, the photoreduction process begins when the e -produced by Cu 2 O transfer to CO 2 adsorbed on CuO (Fig. 13a).The electron and hole pair travels to the surface of the semiconductor resulting in a set of oxidation-reduction reactions.In this mechanism, the presence of Na 2 O can act as a hole scavenger preventing that the CuO coatings on flexible glass fibers were obtained by a rapid and low-cost microwave-hydrothermal method.The coatings obtained were assessed in the combined process of CO 2 adsorption and its photocatalytic reduction to liquid fuels (CH 3 OH and HCOH) at 25 C. Higher CuO concentration (74 wt), and the presence of Na 2 O in the glass fibers favored both high CO 2 adsorption and high formation of value-adding products.The presence of additional compounds in the substrates such as Na 2 O favored the conversion of the CO 2 -adsorbed on the CuO coatings since it could act as a hole scavenger, preventing the re-oxidation of the products obtained.Also, Na 2 O favored a more efficient charge transfer in the samples, as was evidenced by chronoamperometry tests.On the other hand, the presence of chloride in the fibers could promote the formation of by-products with high toxicity, i.e., CH 3 Cl. CuO coatings showed efficiencies up to 11 higher for the CO 2 capture in comparison with previous reports.This study focused on the importance of combined CO 2 adsorption and its photocatalytic reduction using a hybrid material activated with visible-light.This strategy is beneficial for the design of efficient and stable materials for combined CO 2 capture and photocatalytic reduction.

It should be emphasized that if the photocatalytic capture and reduction of CO 2 is normalized per unit of mass of the material (mg CO2 g -1 and mol g -1 ), the Cu/GF1 sample exhibited efficiencies 50 times higher than others reports summarized in Table 3 1, 4-7, 69, 74-77.Besides, the photocatalytic activity for solar fuel generation was up to 11 times higher CH 3 OH and HCOH more compared to other coatings 77."}]}}
