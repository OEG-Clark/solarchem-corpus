Step one was the preparation of the TiO 2 /SBA-15 composite.In this process, 12 g commercial TiO 2 powders (Degussa P25) were slowly poured into 120 mL DI water with 0.4 mL acetylacetone (Sigma-Aldrich) under continuously magnetic stirring.0.2 mL Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to facilitate the spreading of the colloid.2.4 g polyethylene glycol 2000 (Chengdu Kelong, China) was then added and the colloid was magnetically stirred for 12 h.For the preparation of SBA-15, 1 g mesoporous silica SBA-15 (Zhejiang Nasenmei Nano material Co.) was dissolved in 10 mL ethanol under vigorous stirring for 12 h, and then the prepared TiO 2 colloid were added into the SBA-15 solution.The mixture was then continuously stirred over one night.By the impregnation, the TiO 2 nanoparticles can be deposited into and onto the mesoporous structure of SBA-15.The second step was the coating of TiO 2 / SBA-15 onto the carbon paper.Here, the as-received carbon paper (Shanghai Hesen, China) was firstly covered by a paper mask with a hole of 1 cm A 1 cm 1 cm 2 .The prepared TiO 2 /SBA-15 mixture was sprayed onto the carbon paper.After removing the paper mask, the TiO 2 /SBA-15 coated carbon paper was dried under room temperature and then calcined at 550 C for 2 h in the air environment.The third step was the hydrophobic treatment.In this step, the poly-tetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) solution was sprayed onto the other side of the carbon paper without the coated photocatalysts followed by the calcination at 360 C for 1 h in air.The PTFE dry weight was about 1 mg/cm 2 .By doing this, efficient separation of liquid phase from gas phase could be ensured.The last step was the quantum-dots sensitization.To do this, cadmium sulfide (CdS) was coated onto the TiO 2 /SBA-15 surface by the impregnation method 28.In brief, two aqueous solutions were used including Cd(NO 3 ) 2 A4H 2 O and Na 2 SA9H 2 O.The photocatalyst-coated side of the carbon paper was immersed into Cd(NO 3 ) 2 A4H 2 O solution for 10 min followed by washing with distilled water and then immersed into Na 2 SA9H 2 O solution for 10 min followed by washing with distilled water again, forming a cycle.After 5 cycles, the prepared composite membrane was swept with N 2 stream and baked at 100 C for 10 min.So far, the visible-light responsive CdS/TiO 2 / SBA-15carbon paper composite membrane was achieved.In this work, two CdS/TiO 2 /SBA-15carbon paper composite membranes were prepared by varying the weight ratio of TiO 2 in the TiO 2 / SBA-15.One was 20 of TiO 2 , termed as CdS/20 wt TiO 2 /SBA-15, the other was 40 of TiO 2 , termed as CdS/40 wt TiO 2 /SBA-15. Besides, the CdS/TiO 2 carbon paper composite membrane was also prepared for comparison.The total loadings of all samples were about 2 mg/cm 2 . As mentioned earlier, the reactor design is another important factor affecting the performance.In this study, based on the developed composite membranes, an optofluidic membrane microreactor was developed, which was similar to our previous work 26.As illustrated in Fig. 1a, the developed optofluidic membrane microreactor consisted of a liquid microchamber, a composite membrane and a gas microchamber.The assembled membrane microreactor is shown in Fig. 1b.The dimensions of the reaction microchamber were 1 cm A 1 cm A 80 lm, providing the merits of high surfacearea-to-volume ratio, uniform light distribution and enhanced mass transfer.Besides, the hydrophobic treatment of these composite membranes ensured the separation of the gas phase from the liquid phase, by which the reactants of gas CO 2 and liquid phase could be independently supplied into the microreactor, respectively.Such design can also efficiently eliminate the mass transfer resistance associated with the gas/liquid interface and liquid film encountered in conventional slurry reactors. The CO 2 photoreduction system mainly consisted of five components: a syringe pump, a CO 2 gas cylinder, an optofluidic membrane microreactor, a simulated sunlight source and a collection vessel.In this work, different NaOH aqueous solutions were pumped into the liquid microchamber by a syringe pump (Pump 33, Harvard).99.99 CO 2 gas was supplied into the gas microchamber through a gas volumetric flowmeter (Omega, FMA-2617A-1).The flow rate of CO 2 was maintained at 25 mL/min in all experiments.A xenon lamp (CEL-HXF300, CEAULIGHT, China) was employed to simulate the sunlight.The light intensity was controlled by adjusting the distance between the microreactor and xenon lamp, and measured by a FZ radiometer (FZ-A, Photoelectric Instrument Factory of Beijing Normal University, China).An electric fan was used to blow air to the microreactor for the cooling effect such that the temperature effect on the performance of the microreactor can be eliminated.In this work, we measured the methanol concentration to estimate the methanol yield so that the performance of the developed microreactor could be assessed.The products were analyzed by a GC (GC-2010 plus, Shimazu) equipped with an FID detector using a 30-m Wax capillary column.Blank tests were also conducted by feeding inert gas of N 2 and no methanol was detected.All experiments were repeated at least three times under room temperature of about 15 C."}, {"llm generation": "TiO2", "source": "As seen, for pure TiO 2 , the nanoparticles were easily agglomerated to form clusters.", "context": "The prepared composite photocatalysts were characterized by the field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, Hitachi S4800) and the results are presented in Fig. 2. As seen, for pure TiO 2 , the nanoparticles were easily agglomerated to form clusters.The pore size ranged from dozens of nanometers to one micrometer.However, when adding the mesoporous silica of SBA-15, the morphologies were significantly changed.For 20 wt TiO 2 /SBA-15, the morphology of SBA-15 was retained and TiO 2 nanoparticles were uniformly deposited into and onto the surface of SBA-15.Since the TiO 2 loading was low, the mesoporous structure of SBA-15 was remained with a significant amount of meso pores arising from the SBA-15 nature and macro pores between the SBA-15 particles.Such porous structure could enhance the mass transfer and adsorption, photon transfer and light scattering in this layer.As the TiO 2 loading increased to 40 wt, those meso and macro pores were occupied by TiO 2 nanoparticles, making it become rather dense.In this case, the mass and photon transfer might be resisted.Hence, from the point view of the microscopic morphology, the 20 wt TiO 2 /SBA-15 was expected to be favorable for the CO 2 photoreduction. In this work, diffuse reflectance UV-Visible absorption spectra (UV-Vis) was utilized to assess the visible-light response of the CdS/TiO 2 /SBA-15carbon paper composite membranes, and the results are shown in Fig. 3.It can be seen that either CdS/TiO 2 or CdS/TiO 2 /SBA-15 all demonstrated remarkable visible-light response.The main absorption regions of them were all below the wavelength of 540 nm.After adding the mesoporous silica of SBA-15, the absorption domain of CdS/TiO 2 /SBA-15 was clearly increased in the range of 400 540 nm.This may be due to the fact that the mesoporous SBA-15 allowed more CdS to be formed and enhanced the scattering of light.It is also observed that the absorption with the 20 wt TiO 2 was higher than that of the 40 wt TiO 2 .This may be because too high TiO 2 dosage blocked some meso and macro pores, which decreased the photon transfer. Table 1 lists the textural properties of TiO 2 , SBA-15 and TiO 2 / SBA-15 with various TiO 2 dosages determined by the nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms.The BET surface area, pore volume and pore diameter were all derived from the N 2 -adsorption data.Clearly, pure TiO 2 showed the smallest BET surface area, which was much lower than the SBA-15.For the TiO 2 /SBA-15, the addition of TiO 2 into SBA-15 decreased the BET surface area in comparison to SBA-15.This is because when adding the TiO 2 nanoparticles, some intrinsic pores of SBA-15 were blocked, leading to the lowered BET surface area.Although the BET surface areas of the TiO 2 /SBA-15 samples were lower than that of SBA-15, they were still much higher that of pure TiO 2 .In addition, it could also be found that the increase of the TiO 2 dosage resulted in the lowered BET surface area.It is understood that more addition of the Fig. 3.The UV-Vis spectra of the prepared composite membranes. TiO 2 nanoparticles might cause more intrinsic pores of SBA-15 to be blocked.Under such a circumstance, the BET surface area accordingly became lower with increasing the TiO 2 dosage. Because of the same reason, increasing the TiO 2 dosage in the composite membrane led to the decreased pore volume.On the contrary, it is interesting to find that the average pore diameter increased with the increase of the TiO 2 dosage.The average pore diameter increased from 8.045 nm of SBA-15 to 8.428 nm of 40 wt TiO 2 /SBA-15.This may be caused by the contribution of the naked titania character in the photocatalysts with the increase of the TiO 2 dosage 29.In a word, the mesoporous TiO 2 /SBA-15 photocatalyst showed better textural properties than did pure TiO 2 . In this study, the microreactor was operated in an alkaline environment, which had four advantages.First of all, CO 2 could dissolve more in the alkaline environment than pure water.Second, OH A ions could act as hole-scavengers in aqueous solution such that the recombination of hole-electron pairs can be restrained, which is extremely meaningful for the photocatalytic process 30.Third, because the photo-generated holes could be scavenged by the OH A ions, the photo-corrosion of CdS would be weakened, allowing CdS to be more stable 31.Fourth, high methanol selectivity could be obtained for the TiO 2 -containing mesoporous photocatalysts in alkaline environment 32.Because the liquid flow rate, light intensity and NaOH concentration play vital roles in the CO 2 photoreduction to methanol, the developed visible-light responsive CdS/ TiO 2 /SBA-15carbon paper composite membrane was assessed by measuring the methanol concentration at the outlet of the optofluidic membrane microreactor to estimate the methanol yield under different liquid flow rates, light intensities and NaOH concentrations.tion were maintained at 100 mW/cm 2 and 0.05 M, respectively.It can be seen that the optofluidic membrane microreactor with the incorporation of SBA-15 into the composite membrane was able to yield higher methanol concentration than did the CdS/TiO 2 .At the liquid flow rate of 25 lL/min, the methanol concentrations of the CdS/20 wt TiO 2 /SBA-15 and CdS/40 wt TiO 2 /SBA-15 were 0.46 mmol/L and 0.28 mmol/L, respectively, while it was 0.27 mmol/L for the CdS/TiO 2 .Although the methanol concentration for the CdS/40 wt TiO 2 /SBA-15 was just slightly higher than that of CdS/TiO 2 , the amount of TiO 2 in the CdS/40 wt TiO 2 /SBA-15 was much lower than that of CdS/TiO 2 .In this case, the methanol yield based on the amount of TiO 2 for the CdS/40 wt TiO 2 / SBA-15 could still be much higher than that of CdS/TiO 2 , as shown in Fig. 4b.These results can be explained by the above textural properties.The mesoporous SBA-15 with high specific surface area and pore volume can greatly promote the mass transport and reactants adsorption.In addition, the mesoporous structure caused by the added SBA-15 may also strengthen the photon transfer in this layer, which is very propitious to the photocatalytic reaction.As a consequence, the addition of the mesoporous SBA-15 can greatly enhance the CO 2 photoreduction reaction.On the other hand, it can be seen that although the TiO 2 dosage increased from 20 wt to 40 wt, the methanol yield of the latter was lower than the former.The performances of the developed microreactors with these composite membranes followed the sequence of CdS/TiO 2 CdS/40 wt TiO 2 /SBA-15 CdS/20 wt TiO 2 /SBA-15.The explanation of this phenomenon can refer to the BET results.In case that the TiO 2 dosage was too high, more intrinsic pores of SBA-15 were blocked by the TiO 2 nanoparticles, leading to the lowered BET surface area.Correspondingly, the pore volume was also decreased.As a result, the mass transport and reactants adsorption were hindered, while the photon transport was also resisted, both of which decreased the photocatalytic reaction rate.Therefore, the performance of the CdS/40 wt TiO 2 /SBA-15 was lower than that of the CdS/20 wt TiO 2 /SBA-15.This fact indicates that proper design of the ratio of the TiO 2 to SBA-15 is critically important to improve the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 to solar fuels.Besides, it can also be seen from Fig. 4a that the methanol concentration increased firstly and then decreased with increasing the liquid flow rate.The reasons leading to these phenomena can be presented as follows.Low liquid flow rate i.e., large residence time, allowed the reactants to take part in the photocatalytic reaction more efficiently.Hence more methanol could be produced.However, because of oxygen generated in the CO 2 photoreduction process, the generated methanol could be re-oxidized 30.Meanwhile, the desorption of the products became slow at low flow rate and the transfer rate of the OH A ion was small, which also promoted the methanol reoxidation.As a result, the methanol concentration became small at low liquid flow rate.With the increase of the liquid flow rate, although the residence time became shorter, the mass transport of the OH A ion could be enhanced, which facilitated the CO 2 photoreduction reaction.On the other hand, the generated methanol could be efficiently washed away, which avoided the re-oxidation of methanol.Therefore, the methanol concentration was improved as the liquid flow rate was increased from 12.5 lL/min to 25 lL/min.However, as the liquid flow rate was further increased, the methanol concentration started to decline.Three reasons contributed to the declined methanol concentration at high liquid flow rate.First, although the mass transport could be enhanced, the increased liquid flow rate indicated small residence time, which was not beneficial for the CO 2 photoreduction to methanol.Second, an increase in the liquid flow rate means the increased liquid pressure so that more liquid phase was able to penetrate into the carbon paper.More pore space in the carbon paper might be occupied by the liquid phase, hindering the transfer of gas CO 2 from the gas microchamber to the photocatalytic film and thereby decreasing the CO 2 photoreduction rate.Third, the generated methanol could be diluted when the liquid flow rate was increased.As a consequence, the methanol concentration was decreased as the liquid flow rate was increased from 25 lL/min to 75 lL/min.The maximum methanol concentration was achieved at the liquid flow rate of 25 lL/min. With the measured methanol concentration, the methanol yield M (lmole/g-catAh) was calculated according to the following equation, where c (mmol/L) is the methanol concentration, f (lL/min) is the liquid flow rate and m (mg) is the sole TiO 2 loading.As seen in Fig. 4b, the methanol yield in all cases increased firstly and then decreased with the increase of the liquid flow rate.A maximum methanol yield was achieved at a liquid flow rate of 50 lL/min. Clearly, although high liquid flow rate benefitted for the improvement in the methanol yield indicated by Eq. ( 1), low methanol concentrations at both too low and too high liquid flow rates resulted in the decrease of the methanol yield.Therefore, there existed a liquid flow rate leading to the maximum methanol yield.Interestingly, the maximum methanol concentration was achieved at a liquid flow rate of 25 lL/min, while the maximum methanol yield was achieved at a liquid flow rate of 50 lL/min.This might be because the positive contribution of the increased liquid flow rate to the methanol yield was more significant than that of the decreased methanol concentration when the liquid flow rate was increased from 25 lL/min to 50 lL/min.Hence, although the methanol concentration decreased, the methanol yield still continued to increase.Because of this reason, the liquid flow rate leading to the maximum methanol yield was shifted to 50 lL/min.More importantly, it can be found that the addition of SBA-15 could greatly improve the methanol yield.The maximal methanol yield for the CdS/20 wt TiO 2 /SBA-15 and CdS/40 wt TiO 2 /SBA-15 could reach about 800 lmole/g-catAh and 393 lmole/g-catAh, respectively, which was almost four times and one time higher than that of the CdS/TiO 2 , respectively.This fact further indicates that the incorporation of the mesoporous SBA-15 into the composite membrane is a promising way to improve the performance of the CO 2 photoreduction. Because the CO 2 photoreduction is initiated by the photogenerated electron-hole pairs, the light intensity plays an important role in the methanol generation.Hence, it is necessary to investigate the effect of the light intensity on the performance of the optofluidic membrane microreactor with the developed composite membrane.In this study, the light intensity varied from 20 mW/cm 2 to 140 mW/cm 2 , the liquid flow rate was maintained at 25 lL/min, and NaOH concentration was kept at 0.05 M. Because the xenon lamp can generate the heat to change the temperature, the change of the light intensity can affect the operating temperature of the microreactor.To remove the temperature effect, an electric fan was used to cool down the microreactor all the time to keep the microreactor temperature at room temperature.Since the CdS/20 wt TiO 2 /SBA-15 has been proved to be able to yield the best performance, we only compared the CdS/20 wt TiO 2 / SBA-15 with conventional CdS/TiO 2 .The results are presented in Fig. 5, which shows that with increasing the light intensity, both the methanol concentration and yield of the CdS/TiO 2 and CdS/20 wt TiO 2 /SBA-15 increased.More importantly, the CdS/20 wt TiO 2 /SBA-15 always yielded higher performance than did the CdS/TiO 2 .It is easy to understand that high light intensity can generate more electron-hole pairs for the photocatalytic reaction.Consequently, more methanol could be generated, leading to the increase of the methanol concentration and yield.The increased methanol concentration and yield by the CdS/20 wt TiO 2 /SBA-15 can be attributed to the mesoporous structure of SBA-15, which promoted the mass transfer and adsorption and enhanced the scattering of light.Therefore, the CdS/20 wt TiO 2 / SBA-15 yielded better performance than did the CdS/TiO 2 . Although increasing the light intensity can improve the methanol yield, the input solar energy also increases.Hence, it is essential to evaluate the solar energy utilization efficiency.Generally, the reaction for the CO 2 photoreduction to methanol requires six moles of electrons to convert one mole CO 2 to one mole methanol 30.In order to evaluate the solar energy utilization efficiency, the quantum efficiency (QE) was employed and given by the Eqs.( 2) and (3) 33. where I int is the incident light intensity, A is the area of light irradiation, h is the Plank constant, c is the speed of light and k is the wavelength of incident light.In this estimation, it is assumed that one pair of photo-generated electron-hole is generated by one photon.Table 2 lists the quantum efficiencies of the CdS/TiO 2 and CdS/20 wt TiO 2 /SBA-15 under different light intensities.Clearly, the increase of the light intensity decreased the quantum efficiencies of them.As known, although more electron-hole pairs could be generated at high light intensity, more electron-hole pairs might be re-combined, leading to the lowered quantum efficiency.On the other hand, the light intensity may have been beyond the saturation limit 34, so that the increase of the light intensity was unable to improve the quantum efficiency.However, despite the quantum efficiency decreased with increasing the light intensity, the CdS/20 wt TiO 2 /SBA-15 always exhibited higher quantum efficiency than did the CdS/TiO 2 .This can be contributed to the addition of SBA-15, which strengthened the photon transport and absorption as a result of enhanced the scattering of light.Therefore, the addition of SBA-15 can improve not only the methanol yield but also the quantum efficiency. As presented before, the addition of NaOH was because it could increase the CO 2 solubility and CdS stability and prevent the recombination of the electron-hole pairs.Therefore, the performance of the optofluidic membrane microreactor with the developed composite membrane can be greatly affected by the NaOH concentration, whose effect was then investigated in this study. To do this, the liquid flow rate was kept at 25 lL/min, and the light intensity was maintained at 100 mW/cm 2 , while the NaOH concentration ranged from 0.05 M to 0.4 M. As shown in Fig. 6, an increase in the NaOH concentration led to the increase of the methanol concentration and yield for both the CdS/TiO 2 and CdS/20 wt TiO 2 / SBA-15.It is clear that the increased NaOH concentration not only improved the CO 2 solubility, which was helpful for the methanol generation, but also resisted the recombination of the electronhole pairs, which definitely enhanced the CO 2 photoreduction.More importantly, it can be seen that the CdS/20 wt TiO 2 /SBA-15 always yielded better performance than did the CdS/TiO 2 .Increasing the NaOH concentration from 0.05 M to 0.4 M resulted in an increase in the methanol concentration and yield for both CdS/TiO 2 and CdS/20 wt TiO 2 /SBA-15.The improvement in the performance with increasing the NaOH concentration can be explained by the enhanced CO 2 solubility into the solution and the decreased recombination of photo-generated electron-hole pairs.It is also clear that a much higher methanol yield of CdS/20 wt TiO 2 /SBA-15 was obtained than pure CdS/TiO 2 , which thanks to the OH A ions served as holes scavengers.With the mesoporous SBA-15, the transport of the OH A ion can be greatly enhanced so that much more hydroxyl radicals can be formed on the photocatalysts.As a result, the methanol generation by the CO 2 photoreduction can be improved.On the other hand, it has been revealed that a higher selectivity for the methanol formation with TiO 2 based mesoporous photocatalysts was achieved 16, which was also favorable for the improvement in the methanol generation.Because of these reasons, the CdS/20 wt TiO 2 /SBA-15 exhibited better methanol yield.A maximum methanol yield of about 1022 lmole/g-catAh was obtained at 0.4 M NaOH concentration, which was nearly 4 times higher than CdS/TiO 2 In summary, higher NaOH concentration is beneficial for the CO 2 photoreduction and the incorporation of SBA-15 shows the advantageous performance than conventional CdS/TiO 2 ."}, {"llm generation": "CdS/TiO2/SBA-15", "source": "In this work, diffuse reflectance UV-Visible absorption spectra (UV-Vis) was utilized to assess the visible-light response of the CdS/TiO 2 /SBA-15carbon paper composite membranes, and the results are shown in Fig. 3.", "context": "The prepared composite photocatalysts were characterized by the field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, Hitachi S4800) and the results are presented in Fig. 2.

which facilitated the CO 2 photoreduction reaction.On the other hand, the generated methanol could be efficiently washed away, which avoided the re-oxidation of methanol.Therefore, the methanol concentration was improved as the liquid flow rate was increased from 12.5 lL/min to 25 lL/min.However, as the liquid flow rate was further increased, the methanol concentration started to decline.Three reasons contributed to the declined methanol concentration at high liquid flow rate.First, although the mass transport could be enhanced, the increased liquid flow rate indicated small residence time, which was not beneficial for the CO 2 photoreduction to methanol.Second, an increase in the liquid flow rate means the increased liquid pressure so that more liquid phase was able to penetrate into the carbon paper.More pore space in the carbon paper might be occupied by the liquid phase, hindering the transfer of gas CO 2 from the gas microchamber to the photocatalytic film and thereby decreasing the CO 2 photoreduction rate.Third, the generated methanol could be diluted when the liquid flow rate was increased.As a consequence, the methanol concentration was decreased as the liquid flow rate was increased from 25 lL/min to 75 lL/min.The maximum methanol concentration was achieved at the liquid flow rate of 25 lL/min. With the measured methanol concentration, the methanol yield M (lmole/g-catAh) was calculated according to the following equation, where c (mmol/L) is the methanol concentration, f (lL/min) is the liquid flow rate and m (mg) is the sole TiO 2 loading.As seen in Fig. 4b, the methanol yield in all cases increased firstly and then decreased with the increase of the liquid flow rate.A maximum methanol yield was achieved at a liquid flow rate of 50 lL/min. Clearly, although high liquid flow rate benefitted for the improvement in the methanol yield indicated by Eq. ( 1), low methanol concentrations at both too low and too high liquid flow rates resulted in the decrease of the methanol yield.Therefore, there existed a liquid flow rate leading to the maximum methanol yield.Interestingly, the maximum methanol concentration was achieved at a liquid flow rate of 25 lL/min, while the maximum methanol yield was achieved at a liquid flow rate of 50 lL/min.This might be because the positive contribution of the increased liquid flow rate to the methanol yield was more significant than that of the decreased methanol concentration when the liquid flow rate was increased from 25 lL/min to 50 lL/min.Hence, although the methanol concentration decreased, the methanol yield still continued to increase.Because of this reason, the liquid flow rate leading to the maximum methanol yield was shifted to 50 lL/min.More importantly, it can be found that the addition of SBA-15 could greatly improve the methanol yield.The maximal methanol yield for the CdS/20 wt TiO 2 /SBA-15 and CdS/40 wt TiO 2 /SBA-15 could reach about 800 lmole/g-catAh and 393 lmole/g-catAh, respectively, which was almost four times and one time higher than that of the CdS/TiO 2 , respectively.This fact further indicates that the incorporation of the mesoporous SBA-15 into the composite membrane is a promising way to improve the performance of the CO 2 photoreduction. Because the CO 2 photoreduction is initiated by the photogenerated electron-hole pairs, the light intensity plays an important role in the methanol generation.Hence, it is necessary to investigate the effect of the light intensity on the performance of the optofluidic membrane microreactor with the developed composite membrane.In this study, the light intensity varied from 20 mW/cm 2 to 140 mW/cm 2 , the liquid flow rate was maintained at 25 lL/min, and NaOH concentration was kept at 0.05 M. Because the xenon lamp can generate the heat to change the temperature, the change of the light intensity can affect the operating temperature of the microreactor.To remove the temperature effect, an electric fan was used to cool down the microreactor all the time to keep the microreactor temperature at room temperature.Since the CdS/20 wt TiO 2 /SBA-15 has been proved to be able to yield the best performance, we only compared the CdS/20 wt TiO 2 / SBA-15 with conventional CdS/TiO 2 .The results are presented in Fig. 5, which shows that with increasing the light intensity, both the methanol concentration and yield of the CdS/TiO 2 and CdS/20 wt TiO 2 /SBA-15 increased.More importantly, the CdS/20 wt TiO 2 /SBA-15 always yielded higher performance than did the CdS/TiO 2 .It is easy to understand that high light intensity can generate more electron-hole pairs for the photocatalytic reaction.Consequently, more methanol could be generated, leading to the increase of the methanol concentration and yield.The increased methanol concentration and yield by the CdS/20 wt TiO 2 /SBA-15 can be attributed to the mesoporous structure of SBA-15, which promoted the mass transfer and adsorption and enhanced the scattering of light.Therefore, the CdS/20 wt TiO 2 / SBA-15 yielded better performance than did the CdS/TiO 2 . Although increasing the light intensity can improve the methanol yield, the input solar energy also increases.Hence, it is essential to evaluate the solar energy utilization efficiency.Generally, the reaction for the CO 2 photoreduction to methanol requires six moles of electrons to convert one mole CO 2 to one mole methanol 30.In order to evaluate the solar energy utilization efficiency, the quantum efficiency (QE) was employed and given by the Eqs.( 2) and (3) 33. where I int is the incident light intensity, A is the area of light irradiation, h is the Plank constant, c is the speed of light and k is the wavelength of incident light.In this estimation, it is assumed that one pair of photo-generated electron-hole is generated by one photon.Table 2 lists the quantum efficiencies of the CdS/TiO 2 and CdS/20 wt TiO 2 /SBA-15 under different light intensities.Clearly, the increase of the light intensity decreased the quantum efficiencies of them.As known, although more electron-hole pairs could be generated at high light intensity, more electron-hole pairs might be re-combined, leading to the lowered quantum efficiency.On the other hand, the light intensity may have been beyond the saturation limit 34, so that the increase of the light intensity was unable to improve the quantum efficiency.However, despite the quantum efficiency decreased with increasing the light intensity, the CdS/20 wt TiO 2 /SBA-15 always exhibited higher quantum efficiency than did the CdS/TiO 2 .This can be contributed to the addition of SBA-15, which strengthened the photon transport and absorption as a result of enhanced the scattering of light.Therefore, the addition of SBA-15 can improve not only the methanol yield but also the quantum efficiency. As presented before, the addition of NaOH was because it could increase the CO 2 solubility and CdS stability and prevent the recombination of the electron-hole pairs.Therefore, the performance of the optofluidic membrane microreactor with the developed composite membrane can be greatly affected by the NaOH concentration, whose effect was then investigated in this study. To do this, the liquid flow rate was kept at 25 lL/min, and the light intensity was maintained at 100 mW/cm 2 , while the NaOH concentration ranged from 0.05 M to 0.4 M. As shown in Fig. 6, an increase in the NaOH concentration led to the increase of the methanol concentration and yield for both the CdS/TiO 2 and CdS/20 wt TiO 2 / SBA-15.It is clear that the increased NaOH concentration not only improved the CO 2 solubility, which was helpful for the methanol generation, but also resisted the recombination of the electronhole pairs, which definitely enhanced the CO 2 photoreduction.More importantly, it can be seen that the CdS/20 wt TiO 2 /SBA-15 always yielded better performance than did the CdS/TiO 2 .Increasing the NaOH concentration from 0.05 M to 0.4 M resulted in an increase in the methanol concentration and yield for both CdS/TiO 2 and CdS/20 wt TiO 2 /SBA-15.The improvement in the performance with increasing the NaOH concentration can be explained by the enhanced CO 2 solubility into the solution and the decreased recombination of photo-generated electron-hole pairs.It is also clear that a much higher methanol yield of CdS/20 wt TiO 2 /SBA-15 was obtained than pure CdS/TiO 2 , which thanks to the OH A ions served as holes scavengers.With the mesoporous SBA-15, the transport of the OH A ion can be greatly enhanced so that much more hydroxyl radicals can be formed on the photocatalysts.As a result, the methanol generation by the CO 2 photoreduction can be improved.On the other hand, it has been revealed that a higher selectivity for the methanol formation with TiO 2 based mesoporous photocatalysts was achieved 16, which was also favorable for the improvement in the methanol generation.Because of these reasons, the CdS/20 wt TiO 2 /SBA-15 exhibited better methanol yield.A maximum methanol yield of about 1022 lmole/g-catAh was obtained at 0.4 M NaOH concentration, which was nearly 4 times higher than CdS/TiO 2 In summary, higher NaOH concentration is beneficial for the CO 2 photoreduction and the incorporation of SBA-15 shows the advantageous performance than conventional CdS/TiO 2 ."}, {"llm generation": "CdS/TiO 2 /SBA-15carbon paper composite membrane", "source": "In this work, a CdS/TiO 2 /SBA-15carbon paper composite membrane was developed for the optofluidic membrane microreactor toward the CO 2 photoreduction with the visible-light response.", "context": "In this work, a CdS/TiO 2 /SBA-15carbon paper composite membrane was developed for the optofluidic membrane microreactor toward the CO 2 photoreduction with the visible-light response.In addition to the merits provided by the optofluidic platform, the incorporation of mesoporous SBA-15 into the composite membrane could provide large specific surface area and pore volume, enhance light scattering and facilitate the mass and photon transport inside the catalytic layer.Because of these advantages, the optofluidic membrane microreactor with the CdS/TiO 2 /SBA-15carbon paper composite membrane yielded better performance than did the conventional composite membrane.It was also found that too high TiO 2 dosage in the composite membrane could result in the lowered performance because a significant amount of mesopores and macropores might be blocked by the TiO 2 nanoparticles.In addition, the effects of the operating conditions, including the liquid flow rate, light intensity and NaOH concentration were also studied.It was shown that both the methanol concentration and yield firstly increased and then decreased with increasing the liquid flow rate.Meanwhile, increasing the light intensity and NaOH concentration could result in the improvement in the methanol concentration and yield because of more photogenerated electron-hole pairs and OH A ions served as hole scavenges.The obtained results have fully demonstrated that the incorporation of mesoporous materials into the optofluidic membrane microreactor shows promising perspective for the CO 2 photoreduction to solar fuels.Such design can also be applied to other photochemical systems such as wastewater treatment, water-splitting and so on.

Step one was the preparation of the TiO 2 /SBA-15 composite.In this process, 12 g commercial TiO 2 powders (Degussa P25) were slowly poured into 120 mL DI water with 0.4 mL acetylacetone (Sigma-Aldrich) under continuously magnetic stirring.0.2 mL Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to facilitate the spreading of the colloid.2.4 g polyethylene glycol 2000 (Chengdu Kelong, China) was then added and the colloid was magnetically stirred for 12 h.For the preparation of SBA-15, 1 g mesoporous silica SBA-15 (Zhejiang Nasenmei Nano material Co.) was dissolved in 10 mL ethanol under vigorous stirring for 12 h, and then the prepared TiO 2 colloid were added into the SBA-15 solution.The mixture was then continuously stirred over one night.By the impregnation, the TiO 2 nanoparticles can be deposited into and onto the mesoporous structure of SBA-15.The second step was the coating of TiO 2 / SBA-15 onto the carbon paper.Here, the as-received carbon paper (Shanghai Hesen, China) was firstly covered by a paper mask with a hole of 1 cm A 1 cm 1 cm 2 .The prepared TiO 2 /SBA-15 mixture was sprayed onto the carbon paper.After removing the paper mask, the TiO 2 /SBA-15 coated carbon paper was dried under room temperature and then calcined at 550 C for 2 h in the air environment.The third step was the hydrophobic treatment.In this step, the poly-tetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) solution was sprayed onto the other side of the carbon paper without the coated photocatalysts followed by the calcination at 360 C for 1 h in air.The PTFE dry weight was about 1 mg/cm 2 .By doing this, efficient separation of liquid phase from gas phase could be ensured.The last step was the quantum-dots sensitization.To do this, cadmium sulfide (CdS) was coated onto the TiO 2 /SBA-15 surface by the impregnation method 28.In brief, two aqueous solutions were used including Cd(NO 3 ) 2 A4H 2 O and Na 2 SA9H 2 O.The photocatalyst-coated side of the carbon paper was immersed into Cd(NO 3 ) 2 A4H 2 O solution for 10 min followed by washing with distilled water and then immersed into Na 2 SA9H 2 O solution for 10 min followed by washing with distilled water again, forming a cycle.After 5 cycles, the prepared composite membrane was swept with N 2 stream and baked at 100 C for 10 min.So far, the visible-light responsive CdS/TiO 2 / SBA-15carbon paper composite membrane was achieved.In this work, two CdS/TiO 2 /SBA-15carbon paper composite membranes were prepared by varying the weight ratio of TiO 2 in the TiO 2 / SBA-15.One was 20 of TiO 2 , termed as CdS/20 wt TiO 2 /SBA-15, the other was 40 of TiO 2 , termed as CdS/40 wt TiO 2 /SBA-15. Besides, the CdS/TiO 2 carbon paper composite membrane was also prepared for comparison.The total loadings of all samples were about 2 mg/cm 2 . As mentioned earlier, the reactor design is another important factor affecting the performance.In this study, based on the developed composite membranes, an optofluidic membrane microreactor was developed, which was similar to our previous work 26.As illustrated in Fig. 1a, the developed optofluidic membrane microreactor consisted of a liquid microchamber, a composite membrane and a gas microchamber.The assembled membrane microreactor is shown in Fig. 1b.The dimensions of the reaction microchamber were 1 cm A 1 cm A 80 lm, providing the merits of high surfacearea-to-volume ratio, uniform light distribution and enhanced mass transfer.Besides, the hydrophobic treatment of these composite membranes ensured the separation of the gas phase from the liquid phase, by which the reactants of gas CO 2 and liquid phase could be independently supplied into the microreactor, respectively.Such design can also efficiently eliminate the mass transfer resistance associated with the gas/liquid interface and liquid film encountered in conventional slurry reactors.

As seen, for pure TiO 2 , the nanoparticles were easily agglomerated to form clusters.The pore size ranged from dozens of nanometers to one micrometer.However, when adding the mesoporous silica of SBA-15, the morphologies were significantly changed.For 20 wt TiO 2 /SBA-15, the morphology of SBA-15 was retained and TiO 2 nanoparticles were uniformly deposited into and onto the surface of SBA-15.Since the TiO 2 loading was low, the mesoporous structure of SBA-15 was remained with a significant amount of meso pores arising from the SBA-15 nature and macro pores between the SBA-15 particles.Such porous structure could enhance the mass transfer and adsorption, photon transfer and light scattering in this layer.As the TiO 2 loading increased to 40 wt, those meso and macro pores were occupied by TiO 2 nanoparticles, making it become rather dense.In this case, the mass and photon transfer might be resisted.Hence, from the point view of the microscopic morphology, the 20 wt TiO 2 /SBA-15 was expected to be favorable for the CO 2 photoreduction. In this work, diffuse reflectance UV-Visible absorption spectra (UV-Vis) was utilized to assess the visible-light response of the CdS/TiO 2 /SBA-15carbon paper composite membranes, and the results are shown in Fig. 3.It can be seen that either CdS/TiO 2 or CdS/TiO 2 /SBA-15 all demonstrated remarkable visible-light response.The main absorption regions of them were all below the wavelength of 540 nm.After adding the mesoporous silica of SBA-15, the absorption domain of CdS/TiO 2 /SBA-15 was clearly increased in the range of 400 540 nm.This may be due to the fact that the mesoporous SBA-15 allowed more CdS to be formed and enhanced the scattering of light.It is also observed that the absorption with the 20 wt TiO 2 was higher than that of the 40 wt TiO 2 .This may be because too high TiO 2 dosage blocked some meso and macro pores, which decreased the photon transfer. Table 1 lists the textural properties of TiO 2 , SBA-15 and TiO 2 / SBA-15 with various TiO 2 dosages determined by the nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms.The BET surface area, pore volume and pore diameter were all derived from the N 2 -adsorption data.Clearly, pure TiO 2 showed the smallest BET surface area, which was much lower than the SBA-15.For the TiO 2 /SBA-15, the addition of TiO 2 into SBA-15 decreased the BET surface area in comparison to SBA-15.This is because when adding the TiO 2 nanoparticles, some intrinsic pores of SBA-15 were blocked, leading to the lowered BET surface area.Although the BET surface areas of the TiO 2 /SBA-15 samples were lower than that of SBA-15, they were still much higher that of pure TiO 2 .In addition, it could also be found that the increase of the TiO 2 dosage resulted in the lowered BET surface area.It is understood that more addition of the Fig. 3.The UV-Vis spectra of the prepared composite membranes. TiO 2 nanoparticles might cause more intrinsic pores of SBA-15 to be blocked.Under such a circumstance, the BET surface area accordingly became lower with increasing the TiO 2 dosage. Because of the same reason, increasing the TiO 2 dosage in the composite membrane led to the decreased pore volume.On the contrary, it is interesting to find that the average pore diameter increased with the increase of the TiO 2 dosage.The average pore diameter increased from 8.045 nm of SBA-15 to 8.428 nm of 40 wt TiO 2 /SBA-15.This may be caused by the contribution of the naked titania character in the photocatalysts with the increase of the TiO 2 dosage 29.In a word, the mesoporous TiO 2 /SBA-15 photocatalyst showed better textural properties than did pure TiO 2 . In this study, the microreactor was operated in an alkaline environment, which had four advantages.First of all, CO 2 could dissolve more in the alkaline environment than pure water.Second, OH A ions could act as hole-scavengers in aqueous solution such that the recombination of hole-electron pairs can be restrained, which is extremely meaningful for the photocatalytic process 30.Third, because the photo-generated holes could be scavenged by the OH A ions, the photo-corrosion of CdS would be weakened, allowing CdS to be more stable 31.Fourth, high methanol selectivity could be obtained for the TiO 2 -containing mesoporous photocatalysts in alkaline environment 32.Because the liquid flow rate, light intensity and NaOH concentration play vital roles in the CO 2 photoreduction to methanol, the developed visible-light responsive CdS/ TiO 2 /SBA-15carbon paper composite membrane was assessed by measuring the methanol concentration at the outlet of the optofluidic membrane microreactor to estimate the methanol yield under different liquid flow rates, light intensities and NaOH concentrations.tion were maintained at 100 mW/cm 2 and 0.05 M, respectively.It can be seen that the optofluidic membrane microreactor with the incorporation of SBA-15 into the composite membrane was able to yield higher methanol concentration than did the CdS/TiO 2 .At the liquid flow rate of 25 lL/min, the methanol concentrations of the CdS/20 wt TiO 2 /SBA-15 and CdS/40 wt TiO 2 /SBA-15 were 0.46 mmol/L and 0.28 mmol/L, respectively, while it was 0.27 mmol/L for the CdS/TiO 2 .Although the methanol concentration for the CdS/40 wt TiO 2 /SBA-15 was just slightly higher than that of CdS/TiO 2 , the amount of TiO 2 in the CdS/40 wt TiO 2 /SBA-15 was much lower than that of CdS/TiO 2 .In this case, the methanol yield based on the amount of TiO 2 for the CdS/40 wt TiO 2 / SBA-15 could still be much higher than that of CdS/TiO 2 , as shown in Fig. 4b.These results can be explained by the above textural properties.The mesoporous SBA-15 with high specific surface area and pore volume can greatly promote the mass transport and reactants adsorption.In addition, the mesoporous structure caused by the added SBA-15 may also strengthen the photon transfer in this layer, which is very propitious to the photocatalytic reaction.As a consequence, the addition of the mesoporous SBA-15 can greatly enhance the CO 2 photoreduction reaction.On the other hand, it can be seen that although the TiO 2 dosage increased from 20 wt to 40 wt, the methanol yield of the latter was lower than the former.The performances of the developed microreactors with these composite membranes followed the sequence of CdS/TiO 2 CdS/40 wt TiO 2 /SBA-15 CdS/20 wt TiO 2 /SBA-15.The explanation of this phenomenon can refer to the BET results.In case that the TiO 2 dosage was too high, more intrinsic pores of SBA-15 were blocked by the TiO 2 nanoparticles, leading to the lowered BET surface area.Correspondingly, the pore volume was also decreased.As a result, the mass transport and reactants adsorption were hindered, while the photon transport was also resisted, both of which decreased the photocatalytic reaction rate.Therefore, the performance of the CdS/40 wt TiO 2 /SBA-15 was lower than that of the CdS/20 wt TiO 2 /SBA-15.This fact indicates that proper design of the ratio of the TiO 2 to SBA-15 is critically important to improve the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 to solar fuels.Besides, it can also be seen from Fig. 4a that the methanol concentration increased firstly and then decreased with increasing the liquid flow rate.The reasons leading to these phenomena can be presented as follows.Low liquid flow rate i.e., large residence time, allowed the reactants to take part in the photocatalytic reaction more efficiently.Hence more methanol could be produced.However, because of oxygen generated in the CO 2 photoreduction process, the generated methanol could be re-oxidized 30.Meanwhile, the desorption of the products became slow at low flow rate and the transfer rate of the OH A ion was small, which also promoted the methanol reoxidation.As a result, the methanol concentration became small at low liquid flow rate.With the increase of the liquid flow rate, although the residence time became shorter, the mass transport of the OH A ion could be enhanced, which facilitated the CO 2 photoreduction reaction.On the other hand, the generated methanol could be efficiently washed away, which avoided the re-oxidation of methanol.Therefore, the methanol concentration was improved as the liquid flow rate was increased from 12.5 lL/min to 25 lL/min.However, as the liquid flow rate was further increased, the methanol concentration started to decline.Three reasons contributed to the declined methanol concentration at high liquid flow rate.First, although the mass transport could be enhanced, the increased liquid flow rate indicated small residence time, which was not beneficial for the CO 2 photoreduction to methanol.Second, an increase in the liquid flow rate means the increased liquid pressure so that more liquid phase was able to penetrate into the carbon paper.More pore space in the carbon paper might be occupied by the liquid phase, hindering the transfer of gas CO 2 from the gas microchamber to the photocatalytic film and thereby decreasing the CO 2 photoreduction rate.Third, the generated methanol could be diluted when the liquid flow rate was increased.As a consequence, the methanol concentration was decreased as the liquid flow rate was increased from 25 lL/min to 75 lL/min.The maximum methanol concentration was achieved at the liquid flow rate of 25 lL/min. With the measured methanol concentration, the methanol yield M (lmole/g-catAh) was calculated according to the following equation, where c (mmol/L) is the methanol concentration, f (lL/min) is the liquid flow rate and m (mg) is the sole TiO 2 loading.As seen in Fig. 4b, the methanol yield in all cases increased firstly and then decreased with the increase of the liquid flow rate.A maximum methanol yield was achieved at a liquid flow rate of 50 lL/min. Clearly, although high liquid flow rate benefitted for the improvement in the methanol yield indicated by Eq. ( 1), low methanol concentrations at both too low and too high liquid flow rates resulted in the decrease of the methanol yield.Therefore, there existed a liquid flow rate leading to the maximum methanol yield.Interestingly, the maximum methanol concentration was achieved at a liquid flow rate of 25 lL/min, while the maximum methanol yield was achieved at a liquid flow rate of 50 lL/min.This might be because the positive contribution of the increased liquid flow rate to the methanol yield was more significant than that of the decreased methanol concentration when the liquid flow rate was increased from 25 lL/min to 50 lL/min.Hence, although the methanol concentration decreased, the methanol yield still continued to increase.Because of this reason, the liquid flow rate leading to the maximum methanol yield was shifted to 50 lL/min.More importantly, it can be found that the addition of SBA-15 could greatly improve the methanol yield.The maximal methanol yield for the CdS/20 wt TiO 2 /SBA-15 and CdS/40 wt TiO 2 /SBA-15 could reach about 800 lmole/g-catAh and 393 lmole/g-catAh, respectively, which was almost four times and one time higher than that of the CdS/TiO 2 , respectively.This fact further indicates that the incorporation of the mesoporous SBA-15 into the composite membrane is a promising way to improve the performance of the CO 2 photoreduction. Because the CO 2 photoreduction is initiated by the photogenerated electron-hole pairs, the light intensity plays an important role in the methanol generation.Hence, it is necessary to investigate the effect of the light intensity on the performance of the optofluidic membrane microreactor with the developed composite membrane.In this study, the light intensity varied from 20 mW/cm 2 to 140 mW/cm 2 , the liquid flow rate was maintained at 25 lL/min, and NaOH concentration was kept at 0.05 M. Because the xenon lamp can generate the heat to change the temperature, the change of the light intensity can affect the operating temperature of the microreactor.To remove the temperature effect, an electric fan was used to cool down the microreactor all the time to keep the microreactor temperature at room temperature.Since the CdS/20 wt TiO 2 /SBA-15 has been proved to be able to yield the best performance, we only compared the CdS/20 wt TiO 2 / SBA-15 with conventional CdS/TiO 2 .The results are presented in Fig. 5, which shows that with increasing the light intensity, both the methanol concentration and yield of the CdS/TiO 2 and CdS/20 wt TiO 2 /SBA-15 increased.More importantly, the CdS/20 wt TiO 2 /SBA-15 always yielded higher performance than did the CdS/TiO 2 .It is easy to understand that high light intensity can generate more electron-hole pairs for the photocatalytic reaction.Consequently, more methanol could be generated, leading to the increase of the methanol concentration and yield.The increased methanol concentration and yield by the CdS/20 wt TiO 2 /SBA-15 can be attributed to the mesoporous structure of SBA-15, which promoted the mass transfer and adsorption and enhanced the scattering of light.Therefore, the CdS/20 wt TiO 2 / SBA-15 yielded better performance than did the CdS/TiO 2 . Although increasing the light intensity can improve the methanol yield, the input solar energy also increases.Hence, it is essential to evaluate the solar energy utilization efficiency.Generally, the reaction for the CO 2 photoreduction to methanol requires six moles of electrons to convert one mole CO 2 to one mole methanol 30.In order to evaluate the solar energy utilization efficiency, the quantum efficiency (QE) was employed and given by the Eqs.( 2) and (3) 33. where I int is the incident light intensity, A is the area of light irradiation, h is the Plank constant, c is the speed of light and k is the wavelength of incident light.In this estimation, it is assumed that one pair of photo-generated electron-hole is generated by one photon.Table 2 lists the quantum efficiencies of the CdS/TiO 2 and CdS/20 wt TiO 2 /SBA-15 under different light intensities.Clearly, the increase of the light intensity decreased the quantum efficiencies of them.As known, although more electron-hole pairs could be generated at high light intensity, more electron-hole pairs might be re-combined, leading to the lowered quantum efficiency.On the other hand, the light intensity may have been beyond the saturation limit 34, so that the increase of the light intensity was unable to improve the quantum efficiency.However, despite the quantum efficiency decreased with increasing the light intensity, the CdS/20 wt TiO 2 /SBA-15 always exhibited higher quantum efficiency than did the CdS/TiO 2 .This can be contributed to the addition of SBA-15, which strengthened the photon transport and absorption as a result of enhanced the scattering of light.Therefore, the addition of SBA-15 can improve not only the methanol yield but also the quantum efficiency. As presented before, the addition of NaOH was because it could increase the CO 2 solubility and CdS stability and prevent the recombination of the electron-hole pairs.Therefore, the performance of the optofluidic membrane microreactor with the developed composite membrane can be greatly affected by the NaOH concentration, whose effect was then investigated in this study. To do this, the liquid flow rate was kept at 25 lL/min, and the light intensity was maintained at 100 mW/cm 2 , while the NaOH concentration ranged from 0.05 M to 0.4 M. As shown in Fig. 6, an increase in the NaOH concentration led to the increase of the methanol concentration and yield for both the CdS/TiO 2 and CdS/20 wt TiO 2 / SBA-15.It is clear that the increased NaOH concentration not only improved the CO 2 solubility, which was helpful for the methanol generation, but also resisted the recombination of the electronhole pairs, which definitely enhanced the CO 2 photoreduction.More importantly, it can be seen that the CdS/20 wt TiO 2 /SBA-15 always yielded better performance than did the CdS/TiO 2 .Increasing the NaOH concentration from 0.05 M to 0.4 M resulted in an increase in the methanol concentration and yield for both CdS/TiO 2 and CdS/20 wt TiO 2 /SBA-15.The improvement in the performance with increasing the NaOH concentration can be explained by the enhanced CO 2 solubility into the solution and the decreased recombination of photo-generated electron-hole pairs.It is also clear that a much higher methanol yield of CdS/20 wt TiO 2 /SBA-15 was obtained than pure CdS/TiO 2 , which thanks to the OH A ions served as holes scavengers.With the mesoporous SBA-15, the transport of the OH A ion can be greatly enhanced so that much more hydroxyl radicals can be formed on the photocatalysts.As a result, the methanol generation by the CO 2 photoreduction can be improved.On the other hand, it has been revealed that a higher selectivity for the methanol formation with TiO 2 based mesoporous photocatalysts was achieved 16, which was also favorable for the improvement in the methanol generation.Because of these reasons, the CdS/20 wt TiO 2 /SBA-15 exhibited better methanol yield.A maximum methanol yield of about 1022 lmole/g-catAh was obtained at 0.4 M NaOH concentration, which was nearly 4 times higher than CdS/TiO 2 In summary, higher NaOH concentration is beneficial for the CO 2 photoreduction and the incorporation of SBA-15 shows the advantageous performance than conventional CdS/TiO 2 ."}, {"llm generation": "Liquid", "source": "In addition, the effects of the operating conditions, including the liquid flow rate, light intensity and NaOH concentration were also studied.", "context": "In this work, a CdS/TiO 2 /SBA-15carbon paper composite membrane was developed for the optofluidic membrane microreactor toward the CO 2 photoreduction with the visible-light response.In addition to the merits provided by the optofluidic platform, the incorporation of mesoporous SBA-15 into the composite membrane could provide large specific surface area and pore volume, enhance light scattering and facilitate the mass and photon transport inside the catalytic layer.Because of these advantages, the optofluidic membrane microreactor with the CdS/TiO 2 /SBA-15carbon paper composite membrane yielded better performance than did the conventional composite membrane.It was also found that too high TiO 2 dosage in the composite membrane could result in the lowered performance because a significant amount of mesopores and macropores might be blocked by the TiO 2 nanoparticles.In addition, the effects of the operating conditions, including the liquid flow rate, light intensity and NaOH concentration were also studied.It was shown that both the methanol concentration and yield firstly increased and then decreased with increasing the liquid flow rate.Meanwhile, increasing the light intensity and NaOH concentration could result in the improvement in the methanol concentration and yield because of more photogenerated electron-hole pairs and OH A ions served as hole scavenges.The obtained results have fully demonstrated that the incorporation of mesoporous materials into the optofluidic membrane microreactor shows promising perspective for the CO 2 photoreduction to solar fuels.Such design can also be applied to other photochemical systems such as wastewater treatment, water-splitting and so on.
