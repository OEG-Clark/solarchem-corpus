As can be seen from Fig. 2 (a and b), MoS 2 exist as two distinctive phases; a microsphere structures of about 1.2 m in diameter that related to the 2H-MoS 2 sheets 18 and a very thickened staked layers (0.8 m thick) that belongs to the 3R-MoS 2 phase, which is well consistence with XRD analysis.The HR-TEM image of MoS 2 showed the formation of 2D folded sheets structure of MoS 2 as illustrated in Fig. 2c.The lattice fringe is shown in Fig. 2d, which revealed spacing of (d0.72 nm) that was related to (003) or (002) crystal planes of 3R-MoS 2 or 2H-MoS 2 , respectively.Moreover, the SAED pattern showed bright rings which indicated the polycrystalline nature of MoS 2 (Inset Fig. 2d), which are in good agreement with XRD data. MoS 2 shows a broad absorption band that starts from the mid-IR portion to the UV-vis region as depicted in Fig. 3a.The continuous absorption band of MoS 2 \"tail\" 22 is assigned to the indirect electron transition, which proving a formation of a thickened multilayered structure of MoS 2 .The bandgap of MoS 2 was estimated from the Tauc plot and was equal to 1 eV as seen in Fig. 3b.Moreover, two featured peaks of MoS 2 luminescence were detected as illustrated in Fig. 3c.The sharp peak appeared at 610 nm was a characteristic of few-multilayered MoS 2 23.While the peak shown up at 680-700 nm is a monolayerrelated photoluminescence peak 232425.These results confirm the presence of a highly stacked layers of MoS 2 .In addition, the low intensity of MoS 2 luminescence peaks, which is observed by the low PL counts, indicates a very high-speed transition of electrons along the sheets that reflected a low recombination rate of charge carriers, which represented the high expectation of higher photoreduction performance. Raman spectra of MoS 2 revealed the emergence of two active vibrations at 402.97 cm -1 and 374.27 cm -1 that were attributed to E 1 2g and A 1g , respectively as shown in Fig. 4a.The frequency displacement between these two signals is a thickness-dependence value that indicates the number of layers 26,27.Herein, the measured frequency gap was 28.7 cm -1 , which confirmed the presence of more than ten stacked layers of MoS 2 sheets ( 10 L) 26.The elemental compositions and oxidation states were investigated by XPS as elucidated in Fig. 4 (b,c).Mo 3d declared the presence of two different oxidation states.The signals at 232.02 and 228.66 eV were ascribed to 3d 3/2 and 3d 5/2 of Mo 4 , respectively, as observed in Fig. 4b 28.In addition, the characteristic splitting of 3.36 eV confirmed the existence of Mo 4 state 29.The observed peaks at 235.47 and 225.93 were ascribed to Mo 6 3d 3/2 and S 2s, respectively 28.The presence of Mo 6 species in the sample indicated the presence of minor traces of MoO 3 .The corelevel XPS scan of S 2p revealed two well-resolved signals at 162.69 and 161.44 eV that could be assigned to 2p 1/2 and 2p 3/2 , respectively as seen in Fig. 4c 30. CO 2 photoreduction experiments were carried out under UV light to investigate the catalytic performance of MoS 2 .The anion effect was studied using different aqueous solutions.CO 2 photoreduction over MoS 2 sheets showed high catalytic activity towards methanol and acetaldehyde production.In 0.5 M NaHCO 3 , as seen in Fig. 5a, methanol was observed to be the main product with high selectivity along with a considerable amount of acetaldehyde.The maximum production yield of CH 3 OH and CH 3 CHO were 109.6 and 8.9 mol/g with a production rate of 27.4 and 2.2 mol g -1 h -1 , respectively.However, the CO 2 RR in 0.5 M NaOH showed production of lesser amounts of methanol where, conversely, the quantity of acetaldehyde formation was increased as depicted in Fig. 5b.The maximum production yield of CH 3 OH and CH 3 CHO were 44.7 and 9.9 mol/g with production rate of 11.2 and 2.5 mol g -1 h -1 , respectively.In contrast, CO 2 RR over MoS 2 in CO 2 -saturated 0.5 M NaCl revealed a diminishing of methanol formation and a further increasing in the production rate of acetaldehyde as shown in Fig. 5c.The maximum formation yields of CH 3 OH and CH 3 CHO were 31.1 and 19.2 mol/g with formation rate of 7.8 and 4.8 mol g -1 h -1 respectively. The CO 2 RR over MoS 2 shows a variation in the hydrocarbons produced, implying for the effect of solvent (anion) used.However, the CO 2 reduction mechanisms are still unclear, therefore we suggested mechanistic pathways for the CO 2 RR to CH 3 OH and CH 3 CHO by studying anion effect.CO 2 photoreduction in 0.5 M NaHCO 3 solution showed a good selectivity towards CH 3 OH production, which requires a total of 6 electrons to be generated 31.This selectivity could be related to the contribution of HCO 3 -ions to suppress charge carriers recombination and hence initiate multiple reactions pathway that started by the formation of formate anions followed by formyl anion and finally generate methanol 32.Moreover, the formation of CH 3 CHO could be explained by the possible dimerization of intermediates 32,33 that requires a total of 10 electrons to be formed 34. In contrast, we observed a decreasing in methanol production that followed by increasing the generation of acetaldehyde via CO 2 RR in 0.5 M of NaOH or NaCl solutions.This results could be accounted for the presence of OH -or Cl -ions, which both act as hole scavengers that capture photogenerated holes and resulting in an improved separation between photogenerated electron-hole pairs 35,36.In that case, the accumulation of a large extent of electrons would occur at the surface of MoS 2 , which favors the reaction towards the generation of CH 3 CHO through dimerization of two carbon species.The lower quantity of CH 3 OH production would be attributed to interruption of water molecules oxidation by hole scavenger, in addition to a lower content of dissolved HCO 3 -ions in the solution.These results revealed the remarkable effect of OH -and Cl -anions as hole scavengers which accordingly enhanced the electron-hole separation and provided large numbers of electrons that required for CH 3 CHO generation. The Band edge values were calculated empirically by using Mulliken electronegativity 37 by using the following equations, Eq. ( 1) and ( 2): E VB and E CB are the reduction potential values of the VB maximum and CB minimum, respectively. is the Mulliken electronegativity, E e re- presents the free electron energy on the hydrogen scale (4.5 eV), and E g is the bandgap value.The Mulliken electronegativity value was equal to 5.28 eV.Hence, E VB and E CB values were 1.28 and 0.28 eV respectively.The estimated conduction band edge position (0.28 eV) by Mulliken electronegativity is below the required potential to reduce CO 2 to CH 3 OH and CH 3 CHO 38394041.Therefore, the utilization of UVlight irradiation is to provide sufficient energy to excite electrons into the maximum potential edge of the conduction band.Hence, when MoS 2 sheets is irradiated by UV light energy, electrons transfer from the VB to the CB of MoS 2 .Consequently, photogenerated electrons gain fast transitions along MoS 2 sheets which in turn decrease charge carriers recombination, which led to a significant photocatalytic performance as illustrated in Fig. 6.A comparison between the current work and other MoS 2 -based photocatalyst is mentioned in Table 1."}, {"llm generation": "2D-MoS 2 sheets", "source": "Herein, we report for the first time a high photocatalytic performance of CO 2 conversion into CH 3 OH and CH 3 CHO over undecorated 2D-MoS 2 sheets.", "context": "Herein, we report for the first time a high photocatalytic performance of CO 2 conversion into CH 3 OH and CH 3 CHO over undecorated 2D-MoS 2 sheets.The 2D structure morphology of MoS 2 was a great asset for enhancing the mobility of the photogenerated electrons along the sheets, and permitted for higher reduction probabilities of adsorbed CO 2 molecules.However, the photoreduction experiment in different aqueous solutions has greatly affected the hydrocarbons selectivity.It was revealed that the photoreduction of CO 2 in NaHCO 3 aqueous solution has superb selectivity towards CH 3 OH production than in NaOH and NaCl.However, the CO 2 RR in NaOH and NaCl performed high production rate of CH 3 CHO than that in NaHCO 3 , which could be attributed to the hole scavenging effect of OH -and Cl -ions.Hence, the current results are promising and provide new insights into 2D MoS 2 for CO 2 photoreduction to liquid fuel and valuable chemicals.
