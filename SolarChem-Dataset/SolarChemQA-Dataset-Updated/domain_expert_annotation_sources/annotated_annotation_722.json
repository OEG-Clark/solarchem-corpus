temperature, atmo-spheric pressure, and feed flow rate 20 ml/min.", "context": "Fig. 2(a) shows XRD patterns of the bare and calcined ZnV 2 O 6 nanosheets samples.Clearly, the XRD pattern of the bare ZnV 2 O 6 shows one pronounced diffraction peak located at around 2 10.0 .Such a diffraction pattern can be attributed to the ZnV 2 O 6 phase, which is a characteristic of metal alkoxides 38,39.As expected, the bare ZnV 2 O 6 can be converted into highly crystalline ZnV 2 O 6 nanosheets after calcining at 550 C for 3 h in air atmosphere.All the identified diffraction peaks can be assigned to ZnV 2 O 6 with an orthorhombic structure (JCPDS Card No. 01-074-1262).In addition, weak diffraction peaks of V 2 O 5 appeared, indicating the presence of small amounts of V 2 O 5 (JCPDS Card No. 01-072-0433) and the resulting sample was a mixture of ZnV 2 O 6 and V 2 O 5 .Fig. 2(b) shows the interesting crystal geometry of spinel oxide ZnV 2 O 6 , which is formed by ZnO 4 tetrahedra and VO 6 octahedra.It belongs to the FCC type crystal structure with Fd3m symmetry group.According to crystallographic studies, zinc atoms reside in the tetrahedral 8a position whereas the vanadium atoms are on 16d position, which forms a network of corner sharing tetrahedral structure.The oxygen ions are located at the 48e position 31.The surface area (S BET ), pore volume and pore size of ZnV 2 O 6 sample is reported in Table 1.The BET surface area of ZnV 2 O 6 was 11.57m 2 /g and the BJH surface area of 3.8 m 2 /g.Previously, BET surface of ZnV 2 O 4 of 6.1 m 2 /g has been reported 40.This revealed a higher BET surface area of ZnV 2 O 6 compared to ZnV 2 O 4 sample due to their different hierarchical structures.Similarly, the pore volume and pore diameter of 0.0045 cm 3 /g and 17.3 nm for ZnV 2 O 6 sample were obtained, respectively.The reduced pore diameter was possibly due to the controlled crystal growth in the ZnV 2 O 6 sample via one-step solvothermal method.Therefore, well-developed ZnV 2 O 6 structure with larger BET surface area and smaller pore diameter could minimize mass transfer limitations to increase catalyst activity. The morphology and microstructural features of the ZnV 2 O 6 nanosheets were investigated by field emission scanning electron micrographs (FESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).Fig. 3 shows the FESEM and TEM images of the samples obtained at different reaction stages.It can be seen in Fig. 3(a) that the ZnV 2 O 6 sample prepared at 12 h reaction time composed of intermediate products which consists of many compact sheets.However, when the reaction time was increased to 24 h, large amounts of sheets were formed as shown in Fig. 3(b).Evidently, pure ZnV 2 O 6 has hierarchical microstructure consisting of uniform size nanosheets.Moreover, when the ZnV 2 O 6 nanosheets prepared after 24 h reaction time were calcined at 550 C for 3 h, they were partially disordered with improved surface roughness and reduced in size as shown in Fig. 3(c).This revealed that calcination temperature has an impact on the structure and morphology of ZnV 2 O 6 nanosheets.The TEM images of bare ZnV 2 O 6 sample prepared after 24 h reaction time is presented in Fig. 3(d-f).Fig. 3(d) shows ZnV 2 O 6 hierarchical microstructure composed of many compact smaller nanosheets.The interplaner distance was found to be 0.48 nm and 0.42 nm, which corresponds to (111) and (101) planes of ZnV 2 O 6 and V 2 O 5 , respectively as shown in Fig. 3(e) 31,41.The SAED pattern of ZnV 2 O 6 in Fig. 3(f) shows an obvious polycrystalline ring due to the good crystallization of ZnV 2 O 6 .Raman spectra of the pure ZnV 2 O 6 and ZnO/V 2 O 5 samples are depicted in Fig. 6(a).The peaks in the range of 100-1100 cm -1 are observed in the pure ZnV 2 O 6 and ZnO/V 2 O 5 samples.The characteristic peaks of ZnV 2 O 6 at 81, 276, 502, 698 and 900 cm -1 and the peaks of ZnO/V 2 O 5 at 208, 311, 423 and 742 cm -1 are observed in the Raman spectrum.However, the changes are obvious in the position and width of the ZnV 2 O 6 sample peaks.With using one-step solvothermal method, the width of the Raman bands, in particular the peaks increased and the position is slightly shifted toward higher wavenumber, attributed to the reduction of particle size of the ZnV 2 O 6 samples with higher mobility of charges. Fig. 6(b) shows PL emission spectra of the pure ZnV 2 O 6 , ZnV 2 O 6 calcined and ZnO/V 2 O 5 samples excited at a wavelength of 325 nm.ZnO/V 2 O 5 sample displays a broad PL emission peak at 380 and 510 nm that are composed of emissions due to band gap excitations, the interstitial Zn atoms and the excitations between Zn and singly charges surface oxygen, respectively 42.These bands, in the order of their appearance are marked as \"a\" and \"b\" in Fig. 6(b).The ZnV 2 O 6 nanosheets show lower PL emission intensity compared with the ZnV 2 O 6 calcined and ZnO/V 2 O 5 .The weaker intensity of the peak represents the lower recombination probability of free charges, which indicates that coupling of vanadium with ZnO to ternary ZnV 2 O 6 structure using one-step solvothermal method can effectively mitigate the recombination of photo-generated electron hole pairs.The ZnV 2 O 6 calcined displays higher PL emission intensity compared with the ZnV 2 O 6 nanosheets due to different phase structure and morphology as evidenced by XRD and FESEM analysis. The control experiments were conducted for CO 2 reduction with H 2 O under visible light irradiation at room temperature, atmo-spheric pressure, and feed flow rate 20 ml/min.In all cases, carbon containing products were not detected, thus, any carbon based products would be produced during CO 2 reduction process. In order to study the effect of reaction medium, the performance of ternary ZnV 2 O 6 nanosheets for CO 2 reduction was investigated using pure water and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution and the results are shown in Fig. 7(a).It is obvious that CO 2 reduction in the presence of 0.1 M NaOH registered high yield of CH 3 OH which is 2250.5 mol g-cat -1 for ternary ZnV 2 O 6 nanosheets, 1.6 fold higher than using pure H 2 O.This happens mainly because NaOH increases the dissolved CO 2 concentration in the medium and prevents recombination rate of the hole and electron pairs.In addition, highly concentrated OH -ions in the aqueous solution act as strong holes scavengers and forms OH radicals.This consequently leads to more utilization of surface electrons that stimulates CO 2 reduction to CH 3 OH.Fig. 7(b) displays the effect of different ZnO, V 2 O 5 , ZnO/V 2 O 5 , ZnV 2 O 6 and ZnV 2 O 6 calcined catalysts samples photoactivity for dynamic CO 2 conversion with 0.1 M NaOH solution under visible light irradiation.The effectiveness of the catalyst samples were analysed based on the yield of CH 3 OH, HCOOH and CH 3 COOH which were the three products from the process.Pure ZnO, V 2 O 5 and ZnO/V 2 O 5 nanocatalyst synthesized by the sol-gel method scarcely reduced CO 2 and showed very poor activity for CH 3 OH formation.However, the production of CH 3 OH was significantly enhanced using novel ZnV 2 O 6 nanosheets due to hierarchical structure, efficient visible light absorption, efficient charge transfer property and higher electron mobility by coupling of vanadium with ZnO using one-step solvothermal method.In addition, the enhanced photocatalytic activity of ZnV 2 O 6 nanosheets was attributed to electron trapping and hindered recombination rate by V 2 O 5 presented in the sample as evidenced by XRD analysis 43. More importantly, ZnV 2 O 6 calcined at 550 C for 3 h shows very poor activity under the same operating conditions.According to PL emission spectra, the calcined ZnV 2 O 6 sample displays higher PL emission intensity compared with the bare ZnV 2 O 6 nanosheets.Lately, Zhang et al. 39 reported similar observations while investigating hydrogen evolution from water using BiFeO 3 , Bi 2 Fe 4 O 9 and BiFeO 3 /Bi 2 Fe 4 O 9 heterojunction nanofibers under visible light irradiation.Therefore, lower photo-activity of calcined ZnV 2 O 6 sample was probably due to reduction of ZnV 2 O 6 at elevated temperature with different phase structure and much lower band gap energy (E bg 1.81 eV).Additionally, calcined samples would be favourable for CO 2 reduction to hydrogen and other chemicals that were not detected in the product mixture.This is because production of CH 3 OH was not much altered in calcined sample but the HCOOH and CH 3 COOH production were significantly reduced.However, further investigations would be required to find out possible reasons in reduced ZnV 2 O 6 catalyst activity after calcination.Fig. 7(c) shows the effect of different catalyst preparation times of 12 h, 24 h, 48 h and 72 h at one fixed temperature (200 C) for the prepared ZnV 2 O 6 catalysts for CO 2 photo-reduction with H 2 O under visible light irradiation.The effectiveness of the different heating times of samples were analysed based on the yield of CH 3 OH, HCOOH and CH 3 COOH which were the three products from the process.The result shows that the effect of exposure time of heating for 24 h for the prepared ZnV 2 O 6 sample exhibits much higher photoactivity for CH 3 OH, HCOOH and CH 3 COOH evolution than the exposure time of heating for 12 h.However, catalyst preparation time of 48 h and 72 h have no significant effect on production rate and selectivity.Therefore, ZnV 2 O 6 samples prepared at exposure time of 24 h were further used to investigate the effect of irradiation time and stability analysis. Further investigations were carried out to study the effect of irradiation time on dynamic photocatalytic CO 2 reduction in a continuous photoreactor operation.The production of CH 3 OH and CH 3 COOH gradually increased with increasing the time up to an optimum, whereas the HCOOH was decreased and then remained constant as showed in Fig. 8. Fig. 8(a) shows the yield of CH 3 OH on ZnO/V 2 O 5 and ZnV 2 O 6 catalysts under visible light irradiation.It can be seen that ZnO/V 2 O 5 has a lower photoactivity towards CH 3 OH generation in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 com-pare with ZnV 2 O 6 .After irradiation time of 10 h, the CH 3 OH yield of 3253.84 mol g-cat -1 over ZnV 2 O 6 was obtained, 3.4 times higher than that of ZnO/V 2 O 5 (945.28mol g-cat -1 ).This revealed that solvothermal method has a positive impact on the photocatalytic performance of ternary ZnV 2 O 6 nanosheets comparing to the ZnO/V 2 O 5 composite prepared by sol-gel method.Therefore, enhanced photoactivity and selectivity of ZnV 2 O 6 nanosheets can be attributed to more production of electrons-hole pairs under visible light irradiations and their improved charges separation in the presence of V 2 O 5 . Fig. 8(b) presents a dynamic HCOOH production over ZnO/V 2 O 5 and ZnV 2 O 6 catalysts at different irradiation time.HCOOH formation over ZnO/V 2 O 5 and ZnV 2 O 6 presents different behaviour, initially reaching maximum concentration, and then gradually decreased till reached to steady sate.The decreased in HCOOH production over the irradiation time was probably, initially, some amount of CH 3 OH was converted to HCOOH, when there was more production of electrons at the start of the reaction 44.In general, significantly enhanced photoactivity of ZnV 2 O 6 nanosheets toward CO 2 reduction was evidently due to uniform growth of ZnV 2 O 6 nanosheets using solvothermal method and the exceptional morphological structure associated with ZnV 2 O 6 .On the other hand, initially the yield of CH 3 COOH production is increased and then remained constant after 6 h of irradiation time as depicted in Fig. 8(c).However, the amount of CH 3 COOH over ZnO/V 2 O 5 catalyst was significantly higher than ZnV 2 O 6 samples.This confirms that ZnV 2 O 6 nanosheets are less favourable for CH 3 COOH production but has potential for selective CO 2 reduction with H 2 O to CH 3 OH. The yield and selectivity of all the products is summarized in Table 2.The operating parameters employed during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O in solar photoreactor are is 2886.9mol g-cat -1 , 3.8 times higher than HCOOH yield rate over ZnO/V 2 O 5 .On the other hand, the amount of CH 3 COOH produced over ZnV 2 O 6 was much lower than its yield over ZnO/V 2 O 5 catalysts.Therefore, ZnV 2 O 6 catalyst is efficient for the production of CH 3 OH and HCOOH.The observed selectivity was 49 and 43, for CH 3 OH and HCOOH, respectively.In addition, a small amount of CH 3 COOH is produced over ZnV 2 O 6 .Significantly higher and selective CH 3 OH production over ZnV 2 O 6 reveals efficient production of electrons and their utilizations during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction process over 2D ZnV 2 O 6 nanosheets.The performance of ZnV 2 O 6 nanosheets was further compared with the results reported by previous researchers as depicted in Table 4. CO 2 was converted to CH 3 OH using zinc oxide modified reduced graphene oxide nanocomposites (ZnO-rGO) and a yield of 263.1 mol/g was obtained after 3 h reaction time 45.Hexamolybdenum cluster compounds (GO-(TBA) 2 Mo 6 Br i 8 Br a x and GO-Cs 2 Mo 6 Br i 8 Br a x) were used for CO 2 photo reduction with maximum CH 3 OH yield of 1294 and 1644 mol/g after 24 h, respectively 46.Lamellar BiVO 4 were used for CO 2 photo reduction, a maximum CH 3 OH yield of 35 mol/g was recorded after 6 h reaction 47.ZnS was used to convert CO 2 to CH 3 OH and Chang et al. 48 reported optimum yield of 850 mol/g after 1 h.The superior yield of CH 3 OH obtained in the present study using ZnV 2 O 6 2D nanosheets can be attributed to the hierarchical structure with improved charges separation by V 2 O 5 and visible light absorption property of ZnV 2 O 6 as a result of its suitable band gap. In order to check the stability of the ZnV 2 O 6 nanosheets, a photo-stability test was performed with a cumulative 32 h irradiation time.The effects of different irradiation times on the activity of ZnV 2 O 6 for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to CH 3 OH, HCOOH and CH 3 COOH at room temperature, atmospheric pressure, and feed flow rate 20 ml/min are presented in Fig. 9. Evidently, CH 3 OH and CH 3 COOH concentrations gradually increased until reached to steady state in the entire irradiation period, while the yield of HCOOH was decreased significantly.At the start of the reaction, the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction into HCOOH was significantly higher in ZnV 2 O 6 catalyst, possibly due to initially some amount of CH 3 OH was converted to HCOOH, when there was more production of electrons.The maximum HCOOH production was observed initially and then gradually reduced over the irradiation time.Using ZnV 2 O 6 nanosheets, CH 3 OH was observed as the main product during CO 2 photo-reduction.More importantly, catalyst prevailed sustainability even after 32 h of irradiation for continuous production of CH 3 OH.Therefore, novel ZnV 2 O 6 nanosheets provides higher photoactivity and stability for enhanced CO 2 reduction to solar fuels. ZnV 2 O 6 nanosheets is used as photocatalysts to evaluate the photocatalytic activity by photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 into CH 3 OH, HCOOH and CH 3 COOH.During the reduction process, the major reaction steps were described briefly in Eq. ( 1) - (7). CO 2 e - CO The production of photo-excited electron-hole pairs is presented in Eq. 1.The presence of V 2 O 5 leads to an increase in lifetime of charges and fosters redox reaction at the surfaces (Eq.2).Reduction of CO 2 occurs at the CB by the electrons while H 2 O is oxidized by holes at the VB and this is explained in Eqs. ( 3) and (4).Production of HCOOH, CH 3 OH and CH 3 COOH through the reduction of CO 2 by 2, 6 and 8 electrons is discussed in Eqs. ( 4)- (6).Based on the photoactivity and reaction pathway, insights for the reaction mechanism were obtained. The schematic representation of the reaction mechanism is depicted in Fig. 10.Under visible light irradiation, the excited electrons moved from the valence band (VB) of ZnV 2 O 6 nanosheets to its conduction band (CB).Holes in the valence band of ZnV 2 O 6 react with water producing O 2 and H .Absorbed CO 2 molecules are reduced to CH 3 OH, HCOOH and CH 3 COOH by enriched electrons on the ZnV 2 O 6 surface.In the case of CO 2 reduction with H 2 O, CH 3 OH was detected as main product over ZnV 2 O 6 , probably due to appropriate reduction potential of CO 2 /CH 3 OH (-0.38 V), than CO 2 /CH 3 COOH (-0.24 V) and CO 2 /HCOOH (-0.61 V), when compared with CB of ZnV 2 O 6 .Since the reduction potential of CO 2 /CH 3 OH (-0.38 V) is less than the conduction band of ZnV 2 O 6 , the reaction was more favourable for its production.However, CH 3 COOH needed more electrons and its conduction band much lower than the methanol.On the other hand, formic acid reduction potential is much closer if compared with ZnV 2 O 6 .The appropriate band alignment of ZnV 2 O 6 could help for selective CH 3 OH production during CO 2 reduction under visible light irradiation.

The crystalline structure was determined using X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku Smart Lab) with Cu-K radiation ( 0.154178 nm) operated at 40 kV and 30 mA.The XRD patterns were obtained with a scanning rate of 0.02 min -1 and scanning range of 3-100 of 2. The morphology of the samples was examined by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, ZEISS Crossbean 340).The high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM) images of the modified nanoparticles were obtained in a transmission electron microscope (TEM, HITACHI HT7700).Nitrogen-adsorption-desorption isotherms were collected using Micromeritics ASAP 2020 at 77 K, after degassing the samples at 523 K for 4 h under vacuum and using the nitrogen flux.The BET surface area and pore diameter were calculated from the desorption branch of isotherms according to BJH method.Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) diffuse reflectance absorbance spectra were carried out on a Cary 100 Agilent UV-vis spectrophotometer (Model G9821A) equipped with an integrated sphere in the wavelength range of 200-800 nm.Raman and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of samples were recorded at room temperature using Raman Spectrometer (LabRAM HR Evolution, HORIBA), whereas PL was conducted using a laser of 325 nm and RAMAN with a laser of 532 nm as excitation source. The schematic presentation of the slurry type photoreactor for CO 2 reduction is illustrated in Fig. 1.The CO 2 reduction reaction was performed using a quartz glass with a volume of 150 m.A 35W HID Xe lamp was used as a visible light source with a light intensity of 20 MW cm -2 measured using a reference solar cell (91150 V, Newport) 37.First, 100 mg photo-catalyst was suspended in 100 ml distilled water containing 0.1 M NaOH solution under magnetic stirring.Then, compressed CO 2 gas regulated by mas flow controller was continuously bubbled through the solution for 30 min to remove the oxygen before starting experiment.The temperature of the reactor was controlled by circulating cooled water.The control experiments were conducted at 25 C, 1 atm and feed flow rate 20 ml/min.The lamp was turned on to start the photoreaction under continuous CO 2 flow rate.During the reaction process, the liquid products were taken out after 2 h intervals, then were centrifuged using Syringe Filter with Nylon Membrane, pore size 0.45 m and diameter 33 mm to remove catalysts.The concentration of methanol, formic acid and acetic acid were analyzed by a gas chromatograph (GC-7820A) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and HP-5 capillary column.Control experiments were carried out in the dark or without catalyst under the same experimental conditions.The calibration of the GC was conducted using standard solutions of methanol, formic acid and acetic acid.More importantly, methanol peaks areas obtained were consistent in multiple injections, yet peak areas obtained for formic acid and acetic acid were different in different injections and their average values have been used for calibration curve.This was perhaps due to FID detector was not well-suited for the analysis of formic acid and acetic acid."}, {"llm generation": "Xenon", "source": "Fig. 9.

The morphology and microstructural features of the ZnV 2 O 6 nanosheets were investigated by field emission scanning electron micrographs (FESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).Fig. 3 shows the FESEM and TEM images of the samples obtained at different reaction stages.It can be seen in Fig. 3(a) that the ZnV 2 O 6 sample prepared at 12 h reaction time composed of intermediate products which consists of many compact sheets.However, when the reaction time was increased to 24 h, large amounts of sheets were formed as shown in Fig. 3(b).Evidently, pure ZnV 2 O 6 has hierarchical microstructure consisting of uniform size nanosheets.Moreover, when the ZnV 2 O 6 nanosheets prepared after 24 h reaction time were calcined at 550 C for 3 h, they were partially disordered with improved surface roughness and reduced in size as shown in Fig. 3(c).This revealed that calcination temperature has an impact on the structure and morphology of ZnV 2 O 6 nanosheets.The TEM images of bare ZnV 2 O 6 sample prepared after 24 h reaction time is presented in Fig. 3(d-f).Fig. 3(d) shows ZnV 2 O 6 hierarchical microstructure composed of many compact smaller nanosheets.The interplaner distance was found to be 0.48 nm and 0.42 nm, which corresponds to (111) and (101) planes of ZnV 2 O 6 and V 2 O 5 , respectively as shown in Fig. 3(e) 31,41.The SAED pattern of ZnV 2 O 6 in Fig. 3(f) shows an obvious polycrystalline ring due to the good crystallization of ZnV 2 O 6 .Raman spectra of the pure ZnV 2 O 6 and ZnO/V 2 O 5 samples are depicted in Fig. 6(a).The peaks in the range of 100-1100 cm -1 are observed in the pure ZnV 2 O 6 and ZnO/V 2 O 5 samples.The characteristic peaks of ZnV 2 O 6 at 81, 276, 502, 698 and 900 cm -1 and the peaks of ZnO/V 2 O 5 at 208, 311, 423 and 742 cm -1 are observed in the Raman spectrum.However, the changes are obvious in the position and width of the ZnV 2 O 6 sample peaks.With using one-step solvothermal method, the width of the Raman bands, in particular the peaks increased and the position is slightly shifted toward higher wavenumber, attributed to the reduction of particle size of the ZnV 2 O 6 samples with higher mobility of charges. Fig. 6(b) shows PL emission spectra of the pure ZnV 2 O 6 , ZnV 2 O 6 calcined and ZnO/V 2 O 5 samples excited at a wavelength of 325 nm.ZnO/V 2 O 5 sample displays a broad PL emission peak at 380 and 510 nm that are composed of emissions due to band gap excitations, the interstitial Zn atoms and the excitations between Zn and singly charges surface oxygen, respectively 42.These bands, in the order of their appearance are marked as \"a\" and \"b\" in Fig. 6(b).The ZnV 2 O 6 nanosheets show lower PL emission intensity compared with the ZnV 2 O 6 calcined and ZnO/V 2 O 5 .The weaker intensity of the peak represents the lower recombination probability of free charges, which indicates that coupling of vanadium with ZnO to ternary ZnV 2 O 6 structure using one-step solvothermal method can effectively mitigate the recombination of photo-generated electron hole pairs.The ZnV 2 O 6 calcined displays higher PL emission intensity compared with the ZnV 2 O 6 nanosheets due to different phase structure and morphology as evidenced by XRD and FESEM analysis. The control experiments were conducted for CO 2 reduction with H 2 O under visible light irradiation at room temperature, atmo-spheric pressure, and feed flow rate 20 ml/min.In all cases, carbon containing products were not detected, thus, any carbon based products would be produced during CO 2 reduction process. In order to study the effect of reaction medium, the performance of ternary ZnV 2 O 6 nanosheets for CO 2 reduction was investigated using pure water and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution and the results are shown in Fig. 7(a).It is obvious that CO 2 reduction in the presence of 0.1 M NaOH registered high yield of CH 3 OH which is 2250.5 mol g-cat -1 for ternary ZnV 2 O 6 nanosheets, 1.6 fold higher than using pure H 2 O.This happens mainly because NaOH increases the dissolved CO 2 concentration in the medium and prevents recombination rate of the hole and electron pairs.In addition, highly concentrated OH -ions in the aqueous solution act as strong holes scavengers and forms OH radicals.This consequently leads to more utilization of surface electrons that stimulates CO 2 reduction to CH 3 OH.Fig. 7(b) displays the effect of different ZnO, V 2 O 5 , ZnO/V 2 O 5 , ZnV 2 O 6 and ZnV 2 O 6 calcined catalysts samples photoactivity for dynamic CO 2 conversion with 0.1 M NaOH solution under visible light irradiation.The effectiveness of the catalyst samples were analysed based on the yield of CH 3 OH, HCOOH and CH 3 COOH which were the three products from the process.Pure ZnO, V 2 O 5 and ZnO/V 2 O 5 nanocatalyst synthesized by the sol-gel method scarcely reduced CO 2 and showed very poor activity for CH 3 OH formation.However, the production of CH 3 OH was significantly enhanced using novel ZnV 2 O 6 nanosheets due to hierarchical structure, efficient visible light absorption, efficient charge transfer property and higher electron mobility by coupling of vanadium with ZnO using one-step solvothermal method.In addition, the enhanced photocatalytic activity of ZnV 2 O 6 nanosheets was attributed to electron trapping and hindered recombination rate by V 2 O 5 presented in the sample as evidenced by XRD analysis 43. More importantly, ZnV 2 O 6 calcined at 550 C for 3 h shows very poor activity under the same operating conditions.According to PL emission spectra, the calcined ZnV 2 O 6 sample displays higher PL emission intensity compared with the bare ZnV 2 O 6 nanosheets.Lately, Zhang et al. 39 reported similar observations while investigating hydrogen evolution from water using BiFeO 3 , Bi 2 Fe 4 O 9 and BiFeO 3 /Bi 2 Fe 4 O 9 heterojunction nanofibers under visible light irradiation.Therefore, lower photo-activity of calcined ZnV 2 O 6 sample was probably due to reduction of ZnV 2 O 6 at elevated temperature with different phase structure and much lower band gap energy (E bg 1.81 eV).Additionally, calcined samples would be favourable for CO 2 reduction to hydrogen and other chemicals that were not detected in the product mixture.This is because production of CH 3 OH was not much altered in calcined sample but the HCOOH and CH 3 COOH production were significantly reduced.However, further investigations would be required to find out possible reasons in reduced ZnV 2 O 6 catalyst activity after calcination.Fig. 7(c) shows the effect of different catalyst preparation times of 12 h, 24 h, 48 h and 72 h at one fixed temperature (200 C) for the prepared ZnV 2 O 6 catalysts for CO 2 photo-reduction with H 2 O under visible light irradiation.The effectiveness of the different heating times of samples were analysed based on the yield of CH 3 OH, HCOOH and CH 3 COOH which were the three products from the process.The result shows that the effect of exposure time of heating for 24 h for the prepared ZnV 2 O 6 sample exhibits much higher photoactivity for CH 3 OH, HCOOH and CH 3 COOH evolution than the exposure time of heating for 12 h.However, catalyst preparation time of 48 h and 72 h have no significant effect on production rate and selectivity.Therefore, ZnV 2 O 6 samples prepared at exposure time of 24 h were further used to investigate the effect of irradiation time and stability analysis. Further investigations were carried out to study the effect of irradiation time on dynamic photocatalytic CO 2 reduction in a continuous photoreactor operation.The production of CH 3 OH and CH 3 COOH gradually increased with increasing the time up to an optimum, whereas the HCOOH was decreased and then remained constant as showed in Fig. 8. Fig. 8(a) shows the yield of CH 3 OH on ZnO/V 2 O 5 and ZnV 2 O 6 catalysts under visible light irradiation.It can be seen that ZnO/V 2 O 5 has a lower photoactivity towards CH 3 OH generation in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 com-pare with ZnV 2 O 6 .After irradiation time of 10 h, the CH 3 OH yield of 3253.84 mol g-cat -1 over ZnV 2 O 6 was obtained, 3.4 times higher than that of ZnO/V 2 O 5 (945.28mol g-cat -1 ).This revealed that solvothermal method has a positive impact on the photocatalytic performance of ternary ZnV 2 O 6 nanosheets comparing to the ZnO/V 2 O 5 composite prepared by sol-gel method.Therefore, enhanced photoactivity and selectivity of ZnV 2 O 6 nanosheets can be attributed to more production of electrons-hole pairs under visible light irradiations and their improved charges separation in the presence of V 2 O 5 . Fig. 8(b) presents a dynamic HCOOH production over ZnO/V 2 O 5 and ZnV 2 O 6 catalysts at different irradiation time.HCOOH formation over ZnO/V 2 O 5 and ZnV 2 O 6 presents different behaviour, initially reaching maximum concentration, and then gradually decreased till reached to steady sate.The decreased in HCOOH production over the irradiation time was probably, initially, some amount of CH 3 OH was converted to HCOOH, when there was more production of electrons at the start of the reaction 44.In general, significantly enhanced photoactivity of ZnV 2 O 6 nanosheets toward CO 2 reduction was evidently due to uniform growth of ZnV 2 O 6 nanosheets using solvothermal method and the exceptional morphological structure associated with ZnV 2 O 6 .On the other hand, initially the yield of CH 3 COOH production is increased and then remained constant after 6 h of irradiation time as depicted in Fig. 8(c).However, the amount of CH 3 COOH over ZnO/V 2 O 5 catalyst was significantly higher than ZnV 2 O 6 samples.This confirms that ZnV 2 O 6 nanosheets are less favourable for CH 3 COOH production but has potential for selective CO 2 reduction with H 2 O to CH 3 OH. The yield and selectivity of all the products is summarized in Table 2.The operating parameters employed during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O in solar photoreactor are is 2886.9mol g-cat -1 , 3.8 times higher than HCOOH yield rate over ZnO/V 2 O 5 .On the other hand, the amount of CH 3 COOH produced over ZnV 2 O 6 was much lower than its yield over ZnO/V 2 O 5 catalysts.Therefore, ZnV 2 O 6 catalyst is efficient for the production of CH 3 OH and HCOOH.The observed selectivity was 49 and 43, for CH 3 OH and HCOOH, respectively.In addition, a small amount of CH 3 COOH is produced over ZnV 2 O 6 .Significantly higher and selective CH 3 OH production over ZnV 2 O 6 reveals efficient production of electrons and their utilizations during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction process over 2D ZnV 2 O 6 nanosheets.The performance of ZnV 2 O 6 nanosheets was further compared with the results reported by previous researchers as depicted in Table 4. CO 2 was converted to CH 3 OH using zinc oxide modified reduced graphene oxide nanocomposites (ZnO-rGO) and a yield of 263.1 mol/g was obtained after 3 h reaction time 45.Hexamolybdenum cluster compounds (GO-(TBA) 2 Mo 6 Br i 8 Br a x and GO-Cs 2 Mo 6 Br i 8 Br a x) were used for CO 2 photo reduction with maximum CH 3 OH yield of 1294 and 1644 mol/g after 24 h, respectively 46.Lamellar BiVO 4 were used for CO 2 photo reduction, a maximum CH 3 OH yield of 35 mol/g was recorded after 6 h reaction 47.ZnS was used to convert CO 2 to CH 3 OH and Chang et al. 48 reported optimum yield of 850 mol/g after 1 h.The superior yield of CH 3 OH obtained in the present study using ZnV 2 O 6 2D nanosheets can be attributed to the hierarchical structure with improved charges separation by V 2 O 5 and visible light absorption property of ZnV 2 O 6 as a result of its suitable band gap. In order to check the stability of the ZnV 2 O 6 nanosheets, a photo-stability test was performed with a cumulative 32 h irradiation time.The effects of different irradiation times on the activity of ZnV 2 O 6 for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to CH 3 OH, HCOOH and CH 3 COOH at room temperature, atmospheric pressure, and feed flow rate 20 ml/min are presented in Fig. 9. Evidently, CH 3 OH and CH 3 COOH concentrations gradually increased until reached to steady state in the entire irradiation period, while the yield of HCOOH was decreased significantly.At the start of the reaction, the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction into HCOOH was significantly higher in ZnV 2 O 6 catalyst, possibly due to initially some amount of CH 3 OH was converted to HCOOH, when there was more production of electrons.The maximum HCOOH production was observed initially and then gradually reduced over the irradiation time.Using ZnV 2 O 6 nanosheets, CH 3 OH was observed as the main product during CO 2 photo-reduction.More importantly, catalyst prevailed sustainability even after 32 h of irradiation for continuous production of CH 3 OH.Therefore, novel ZnV 2 O 6 nanosheets provides higher photoactivity and stability for enhanced CO 2 reduction to solar fuels. ZnV 2 O 6 nanosheets is used as photocatalysts to evaluate the photocatalytic activity by photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 into CH 3 OH, HCOOH and CH 3 COOH.During the reduction process, the major reaction steps were described briefly in Eq. ( 1) - (7). CO 2 e - CO The production of photo-excited electron-hole pairs is presented in Eq. 1.The presence of V 2 O 5 leads to an increase in lifetime of charges and fosters redox reaction at the surfaces (Eq.2).Reduction of CO 2 occurs at the CB by the electrons while H 2 O is oxidized by holes at the VB and this is explained in Eqs. ( 3) and (4).Production of HCOOH, CH 3 OH and CH 3 COOH through the reduction of CO 2 by 2, 6 and 8 electrons is discussed in Eqs. ( 4)- (6).Based on the photoactivity and reaction pathway, insights for the reaction mechanism were obtained. The schematic representation of the reaction mechanism is depicted in Fig. 10.Under visible light irradiation, the excited electrons moved from the valence band (VB) of ZnV 2 O 6 nanosheets to its conduction band (CB).Holes in the valence band of ZnV 2 O 6 react with water producing O 2 and H .Absorbed CO 2 molecules are reduced to CH 3 OH, HCOOH and CH 3 COOH by enriched electrons on the ZnV 2 O 6 surface.In the case of CO 2 reduction with H 2 O, CH 3 OH was detected as main product over ZnV 2 O 6 , probably due to appropriate reduction potential of CO 2 /CH 3 OH (-0.38 V), than CO 2 /CH 3 COOH (-0.24 V) and CO 2 /HCOOH (-0.61 V), when compared with CB of ZnV 2 O 6 .Since the reduction potential of CO 2 /CH 3 OH (-0.38 V) is less than the conduction band of ZnV 2 O 6 , the reaction was more favourable for its production.However, CH 3 COOH needed more electrons and its conduction band much lower than the methanol.On the other hand, formic acid reduction potential is much closer if compared with ZnV 2 O 6 .The appropriate band alignment of ZnV 2 O 6 could help for selective CH 3 OH production during CO 2 reduction under visible light irradiation.

The schematic presentation of the slurry type photoreactor for CO 2 reduction is illustrated in Fig. 1.The CO 2 reduction reaction was performed using a quartz glass with a volume of 150 m.A 35W HID Xe lamp was used as a visible light source with a light intensity of 20 MW cm -2 measured using a reference solar cell (91150 V, Newport) 37.First, 100 mg photo-catalyst was suspended in 100 ml distilled water containing 0.1 M NaOH solution under magnetic stirring.Then, compressed CO 2 gas regulated by mas flow controller was continuously bubbled through the solution for 30 min to remove the oxygen before starting experiment.The temperature of the reactor was controlled by circulating cooled water.The control experiments were conducted at 25 C, 1 atm and feed flow rate 20 ml/min.The lamp was turned on to start the photoreaction under continuous CO 2 flow rate.During the reaction process, the liquid products were taken out after 2 h intervals, then were centrifuged using Syringe Filter with Nylon Membrane, pore size 0.45 m and diameter 33 mm to remove catalysts.The concentration of methanol, formic acid and acetic acid were analyzed by a gas chromatograph (GC-7820A) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and HP-5 capillary column.Control experiments were carried out in the dark or without catalyst under the same experimental conditions.The calibration of the GC was conducted using standard solutions of methanol, formic acid and acetic acid.More importantly, methanol peaks areas obtained were consistent in multiple injections, yet peak areas obtained for formic acid and acetic acid were different in different injections and their average values have been used for calibration curve.This was perhaps due to FID detector was not well-suited for the analysis of formic acid and acetic acid."}, {"llm generation": "Liquid", "source": "In order to study the effect of reaction medium, the performance of ternary ZnV 2 O 6 nanosheets for CO 2 reduction was investigated using pure water and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution and the results are shown in Fig. 7(a).", "context": "Fig. 2(a) shows XRD patterns of the bare and calcined ZnV 2 O 6 nanosheets samples.Clearly, the XRD pattern of the bare ZnV 2 O 6 shows one pronounced diffraction peak located at around 2 10.0 .Such a diffraction pattern can be attributed to the ZnV 2 O 6 phase, which is a characteristic of metal alkoxides 38,39.As expected, the bare ZnV 2 O 6 can be converted into highly crystalline ZnV 2 O 6 nanosheets after calcining at 550 C for 3 h in air atmosphere.All the identified diffraction peaks can be assigned to ZnV 2 O 6 with an orthorhombic structure (JCPDS Card No. 01-074-1262).In addition, weak diffraction peaks of V 2 O 5 appeared, indicating the presence of small amounts of V 2 O 5 (JCPDS Card No. 01-072-0433) and the resulting sample was a mixture of ZnV 2 O 6 and V 2 O 5 .Fig. 2(b) shows the interesting crystal geometry of spinel oxide ZnV 2 O 6 , which is formed by ZnO 4 tetrahedra and VO 6 octahedra.It belongs to the FCC type crystal structure with Fd3m symmetry group.According to crystallographic studies, zinc atoms reside in the tetrahedral 8a position whereas the vanadium atoms are on 16d position, which forms a network of corner sharing tetrahedral structure.The oxygen ions are located at the 48e position 31.The surface area (S BET ), pore volume and pore size of ZnV 2 O 6 sample is reported in Table 1.The BET surface area of ZnV 2 O 6 was 11.57m 2 /g and the BJH surface area of 3.8 m 2 /g.Previously, BET surface of ZnV 2 O 4 of 6.1 m 2 /g has been reported 40.This revealed a higher BET surface area of ZnV 2 O 6 compared to ZnV 2 O 4 sample due to their different hierarchical structures.Similarly, the pore volume and pore diameter of 0.0045 cm 3 /g and 17.3 nm for ZnV 2 O 6 sample were obtained, respectively.The reduced pore diameter was possibly due to the controlled crystal growth in the ZnV 2 O 6 sample via one-step solvothermal method.Therefore, well-developed ZnV 2 O 6 structure with larger BET surface area and smaller pore diameter could minimize mass transfer limitations to increase catalyst activity. The morphology and microstructural features of the ZnV 2 O 6 nanosheets were investigated by field emission scanning electron micrographs (FESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).Fig. 3 shows the FESEM and TEM images of the samples obtained at different reaction stages.It can be seen in Fig. 3(a) that the ZnV 2 O 6 sample prepared at 12 h reaction time composed of intermediate products which consists of many compact sheets.However, when the reaction time was increased to 24 h, large amounts of sheets were formed as shown in Fig. 3(b).Evidently, pure ZnV 2 O 6 has hierarchical microstructure consisting of uniform size nanosheets.Moreover, when the ZnV 2 O 6 nanosheets prepared after 24 h reaction time were calcined at 550 C for 3 h, they were partially disordered with improved surface roughness and reduced in size as shown in Fig. 3(c).This revealed that calcination temperature has an impact on the structure and morphology of ZnV 2 O 6 nanosheets.The TEM images of bare ZnV 2 O 6 sample prepared after 24 h reaction time is presented in Fig. 3(d-f).Fig. 3(d) shows ZnV 2 O 6 hierarchical microstructure composed of many compact smaller nanosheets.The interplaner distance was found to be 0.48 nm and 0.42 nm, which corresponds to (111) and (101) planes of ZnV 2 O 6 and V 2 O 5 , respectively as shown in Fig. 3(e) 31,41.The SAED pattern of ZnV 2 O 6 in Fig. 3(f) shows an obvious polycrystalline ring due to the good crystallization of ZnV 2 O 6 .Raman spectra of the pure ZnV 2 O 6 and ZnO/V 2 O 5 samples are depicted in Fig. 6(a).The peaks in the range of 100-1100 cm -1 are observed in the pure ZnV 2 O 6 and ZnO/V 2 O 5 samples.The characteristic peaks of ZnV 2 O 6 at 81, 276, 502, 698 and 900 cm -1 and the peaks of ZnO/V 2 O 5 at 208, 311, 423 and 742 cm -1 are observed in the Raman spectrum.However, the changes are obvious in the position and width of the ZnV 2 O 6 sample peaks.With using one-step solvothermal method, the width of the Raman bands, in particular the peaks increased and the position is slightly shifted toward higher wavenumber, attributed to the reduction of particle size of the ZnV 2 O 6 samples with higher mobility of charges. Fig. 6(b) shows PL emission spectra of the pure ZnV 2 O 6 , ZnV 2 O 6 calcined and ZnO/V 2 O 5 samples excited at a wavelength of 325 nm.ZnO/V 2 O 5 sample displays a broad PL emission peak at 380 and 510 nm that are composed of emissions due to band gap excitations, the interstitial Zn atoms and the excitations between Zn and singly charges surface oxygen, respectively 42.These bands, in the order of their appearance are marked as \"a\" and \"b\" in Fig. 6(b).The ZnV 2 O 6 nanosheets show lower PL emission intensity compared with the ZnV 2 O 6 calcined and ZnO/V 2 O 5 .The weaker intensity of the peak represents the lower recombination probability of free charges, which indicates that coupling of vanadium with ZnO to ternary ZnV 2 O 6 structure using one-step solvothermal method can effectively mitigate the recombination of photo-generated electron hole pairs.The ZnV 2 O 6 calcined displays higher PL emission intensity compared with the ZnV 2 O 6 nanosheets due to different phase structure and morphology as evidenced by XRD and FESEM analysis. The control experiments were conducted for CO 2 reduction with H 2 O under visible light irradiation at room temperature, atmo-spheric pressure, and feed flow rate 20 ml/min.In all cases, carbon containing products were not detected, thus, any carbon based products would be produced during CO 2 reduction process. In order to study the effect of reaction medium, the performance of ternary ZnV 2 O 6 nanosheets for CO 2 reduction was investigated using pure water and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution and the results are shown in Fig. 7(a).It is obvious that CO 2 reduction in the presence of 0.1 M NaOH registered high yield of CH 3 OH which is 2250.5 mol g-cat -1 for ternary ZnV 2 O 6 nanosheets, 1.6 fold higher than using pure H 2 O.This happens mainly because NaOH increases the dissolved CO 2 concentration in the medium and prevents recombination rate of the hole and electron pairs.In addition, highly concentrated OH -ions in the aqueous solution act as strong holes scavengers and forms OH radicals.This consequently leads to more utilization of surface electrons that stimulates CO 2 reduction to CH 3 OH.Fig. 7(b) displays the effect of different ZnO, V 2 O 5 , ZnO/V 2 O 5 , ZnV 2 O 6 and ZnV 2 O 6 calcined catalysts samples photoactivity for dynamic CO 2 conversion with 0.1 M NaOH solution under visible light irradiation.The effectiveness of the catalyst samples were analysed based on the yield of CH 3 OH, HCOOH and CH 3 COOH which were the three products from the process.Pure ZnO, V 2 O 5 and ZnO/V 2 O 5 nanocatalyst synthesized by the sol-gel method scarcely reduced CO 2 and showed very poor activity for CH 3 OH formation.However, the production of CH 3 OH was significantly enhanced using novel ZnV 2 O 6 nanosheets due to hierarchical structure, efficient visible light absorption, efficient charge transfer property and higher electron mobility by coupling of vanadium with ZnO using one-step solvothermal method.In addition, the enhanced photocatalytic activity of ZnV 2 O 6 nanosheets was attributed to electron trapping and hindered recombination rate by V 2 O 5 presented in the sample as evidenced by XRD analysis 43. More importantly, ZnV 2 O 6 calcined at 550 C for 3 h shows very poor activity under the same operating conditions.According to PL emission spectra, the calcined ZnV 2 O 6 sample displays higher PL emission intensity compared with the bare ZnV 2 O 6 nanosheets.Lately, Zhang et al. 39 reported similar observations while investigating hydrogen evolution from water using BiFeO 3 , Bi 2 Fe 4 O 9 and BiFeO 3 /Bi 2 Fe 4 O 9 heterojunction nanofibers under visible light irradiation.Therefore, lower photo-activity of calcined ZnV 2 O 6 sample was probably due to reduction of ZnV 2 O 6 at elevated temperature with different phase structure and much lower band gap energy (E bg 1.81 eV).Additionally, calcined samples would be favourable for CO 2 reduction to hydrogen and other chemicals that were not detected in the product mixture.This is because production of CH 3 OH was not much altered in calcined sample but the HCOOH and CH 3 COOH production were significantly reduced.However, further investigations would be required to find out possible reasons in reduced ZnV 2 O 6 catalyst activity after calcination.Fig. 7(c) shows the effect of different catalyst preparation times of 12 h, 24 h, 48 h and 72 h at one fixed temperature (200 C) for the prepared ZnV 2 O 6 catalysts for CO 2 photo-reduction with H 2 O under visible light irradiation.The effectiveness of the different heating times of samples were analysed based on the yield of CH 3 OH, HCOOH and CH 3 COOH which were the three products from the process.The result shows that the effect of exposure time of heating for 24 h for the prepared ZnV 2 O 6 sample exhibits much higher photoactivity for CH 3 OH, HCOOH and CH 3 COOH evolution than the exposure time of heating for 12 h.However, catalyst preparation time of 48 h and 72 h have no significant effect on production rate and selectivity.Therefore, ZnV 2 O 6 samples prepared at exposure time of 24 h were further used to investigate the effect of irradiation time and stability analysis. Further investigations were carried out to study the effect of irradiation time on dynamic photocatalytic CO 2 reduction in a continuous photoreactor operation.The production of CH 3 OH and CH 3 COOH gradually increased with increasing the time up to an optimum, whereas the HCOOH was decreased and then remained constant as showed in Fig. 8. Fig. 8(a) shows the yield of CH 3 OH on ZnO/V 2 O 5 and ZnV 2 O 6 catalysts under visible light irradiation.It can be seen that ZnO/V 2 O 5 has a lower photoactivity towards CH 3 OH generation in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 com-pare with ZnV 2 O 6 .After irradiation time of 10 h, the CH 3 OH yield of 3253.84 mol g-cat -1 over ZnV 2 O 6 was obtained, 3.4 times higher than that of ZnO/V 2 O 5 (945.28mol g-cat -1 ).This revealed that solvothermal method has a positive impact on the photocatalytic performance of ternary ZnV 2 O 6 nanosheets comparing to the ZnO/V 2 O 5 composite prepared by sol-gel method.Therefore, enhanced photoactivity and selectivity of ZnV 2 O 6 nanosheets can be attributed to more production of electrons-hole pairs under visible light irradiations and their improved charges separation in the presence of V 2 O 5 . Fig. 8(b) presents a dynamic HCOOH production over ZnO/V 2 O 5 and ZnV 2 O 6 catalysts at different irradiation time.HCOOH formation over ZnO/V 2 O 5 and ZnV 2 O 6 presents different behaviour, initially reaching maximum concentration, and then gradually decreased till reached to steady sate.The decreased in HCOOH production over the irradiation time was probably, initially, some amount of CH 3 OH was converted to HCOOH, when there was more production of electrons at the start of the reaction 44.In general, significantly enhanced photoactivity of ZnV 2 O 6 nanosheets toward CO 2 reduction was evidently due to uniform growth of ZnV 2 O 6 nanosheets using solvothermal method and the exceptional morphological structure associated with ZnV 2 O 6 .On the other hand, initially the yield of CH 3 COOH production is increased and then remained constant after 6 h of irradiation time as depicted in Fig. 8(c).However, the amount of CH 3 COOH over ZnO/V 2 O 5 catalyst was significantly higher than ZnV 2 O 6 samples.This confirms that ZnV 2 O 6 nanosheets are less favourable for CH 3 COOH production but has potential for selective CO 2 reduction with H 2 O to CH 3 OH. The yield and selectivity of all the products is summarized in Table 2.The operating parameters employed during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O in solar photoreactor are is 2886.9mol g-cat -1 , 3.8 times higher than HCOOH yield rate over ZnO/V 2 O 5 .On the other hand, the amount of CH 3 COOH produced over ZnV 2 O 6 was much lower than its yield over ZnO/V 2 O 5 catalysts.Therefore, ZnV 2 O 6 catalyst is efficient for the production of CH 3 OH and HCOOH.The observed selectivity was 49 and 43, for CH 3 OH and HCOOH, respectively.In addition, a small amount of CH 3 COOH is produced over ZnV 2 O 6 .Significantly higher and selective CH 3 OH production over ZnV 2 O 6 reveals efficient production of electrons and their utilizations during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction process over 2D ZnV 2 O 6 nanosheets.The performance of ZnV 2 O 6 nanosheets was further compared with the results reported by previous researchers as depicted in Table 4. CO 2 was converted to CH 3 OH using zinc oxide modified reduced graphene oxide nanocomposites (ZnO-rGO) and a yield of 263.1 mol/g was obtained after 3 h reaction time 45.Hexamolybdenum cluster compounds (GO-(TBA) 2 Mo 6 Br i 8 Br a x and GO-Cs 2 Mo 6 Br i 8 Br a x) were used for CO 2 photo reduction with maximum CH 3 OH yield of 1294 and 1644 mol/g after 24 h, respectively 46.Lamellar BiVO 4 were used for CO 2 photo reduction, a maximum CH 3 OH yield of 35 mol/g was recorded after 6 h reaction 47.ZnS was used to convert CO 2 to CH 3 OH and Chang et al. 48 reported optimum yield of 850 mol/g after 1 h.The superior yield of CH 3 OH obtained in the present study using ZnV 2 O 6 2D nanosheets can be attributed to the hierarchical structure with improved charges separation by V 2 O 5 and visible light absorption property of ZnV 2 O 6 as a result of its suitable band gap. In order to check the stability of the ZnV 2 O 6 nanosheets, a photo-stability test was performed with a cumulative 32 h irradiation time.The effects of different irradiation times on the activity of ZnV 2 O 6 for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to CH 3 OH, HCOOH and CH 3 COOH at room temperature, atmospheric pressure, and feed flow rate 20 ml/min are presented in Fig. 9. Evidently, CH 3 OH and CH 3 COOH concentrations gradually increased until reached to steady state in the entire irradiation period, while the yield of HCOOH was decreased significantly.At the start of the reaction, the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction into HCOOH was significantly higher in ZnV 2 O 6 catalyst, possibly due to initially some amount of CH 3 OH was converted to HCOOH, when there was more production of electrons.The maximum HCOOH production was observed initially and then gradually reduced over the irradiation time.Using ZnV 2 O 6 nanosheets, CH 3 OH was observed as the main product during CO 2 photo-reduction.More importantly, catalyst prevailed sustainability even after 32 h of irradiation for continuous production of CH 3 OH.Therefore, novel ZnV 2 O 6 nanosheets provides higher photoactivity and stability for enhanced CO 2 reduction to solar fuels. ZnV 2 O 6 nanosheets is used as photocatalysts to evaluate the photocatalytic activity by photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 into CH 3 OH, HCOOH and CH 3 COOH.During the reduction process, the major reaction steps were described briefly in Eq. ( 1) - (7). CO 2 e - CO The production of photo-excited electron-hole pairs is presented in Eq. 1.The presence of V 2 O 5 leads to an increase in lifetime of charges and fosters redox reaction at the surfaces (Eq.2).Reduction of CO 2 occurs at the CB by the electrons while H 2 O is oxidized by holes at the VB and this is explained in Eqs. ( 3) and (4).Production of HCOOH, CH 3 OH and CH 3 COOH through the reduction of CO 2 by 2, 6 and 8 electrons is discussed in Eqs. ( 4)- (6).Based on the photoactivity and reaction pathway, insights for the reaction mechanism were obtained. The schematic representation of the reaction mechanism is depicted in Fig. 10.Under visible light irradiation, the excited electrons moved from the valence band (VB) of ZnV 2 O 6 nanosheets to its conduction band (CB).Holes in the valence band of ZnV 2 O 6 react with water producing O 2 and H .Absorbed CO 2 molecules are reduced to CH 3 OH, HCOOH and CH 3 COOH by enriched electrons on the ZnV 2 O 6 surface.In the case of CO 2 reduction with H 2 O, CH 3 OH was detected as main product over ZnV 2 O 6 , probably due to appropriate reduction potential of CO 2 /CH 3 OH (-0.38 V), than CO 2 /CH 3 COOH (-0.24 V) and CO 2 /HCOOH (-0.61 V), when compared with CB of ZnV 2 O 6 .Since the reduction potential of CO 2 /CH 3 OH (-0.38 V) is less than the conduction band of ZnV 2 O 6 , the reaction was more favourable for its production.However, CH 3 COOH needed more electrons and its conduction band much lower than the methanol.On the other hand, formic acid reduction potential is much closer if compared with ZnV 2 O 6 .The appropriate band alignment of ZnV 2 O 6 could help for selective CH 3 OH production during CO 2 reduction under visible light irradiation.

The schematic presentation of the slurry type photoreactor for CO 2 reduction is illustrated in Fig. 1.The CO 2 reduction reaction was performed using a quartz glass with a volume of 150 m.A 35W HID Xe lamp was used as a visible light source with a light intensity of 20 MW cm -2 measured using a reference solar cell (91150 V, Newport) 37.First, 100 mg photo-catalyst was suspended in 100 ml distilled water containing 0.1 M NaOH solution under magnetic stirring.Then, compressed CO 2 gas regulated by mas flow controller was continuously bubbled through the solution for 30 min to remove the oxygen before starting experiment.The temperature of the reactor was controlled by circulating cooled water.The control experiments were conducted at 25 C, 1 atm and feed flow rate 20 ml/min.The lamp was turned on to start the photoreaction under continuous CO 2 flow rate.During the reaction process, the liquid products were taken out after 2 h intervals, then were centrifuged using Syringe Filter with Nylon Membrane, pore size 0.45 m and diameter 33 mm to remove catalysts.The concentration of methanol, formic acid and acetic acid were analyzed by a gas chromatograph (GC-7820A) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and HP-5 capillary column.Control experiments were carried out in the dark or without catalyst under the same experimental conditions.The calibration of the GC was conducted using standard solutions of methanol, formic acid and acetic acid.More importantly, methanol peaks areas obtained were consistent in multiple injections, yet peak areas obtained for formic acid and acetic acid were different in different injections and their average values have been used for calibration curve.This was perhaps due to FID detector was not well-suited for the analysis of formic acid and acetic acid."}]}}
