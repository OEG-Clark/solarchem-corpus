ZnS(en)0.5 precursor was synthesized via a solvothermal route in the presence of ethylenediamine (en) as solvent and structure-directing agent according to the protocol reported previously 29.In a typical process, 1 mmol of Zn powder and 3 mmol of S powder were dissolved in 90 mL of ethylenediamine under constant stirring for half an hour.Subsequently, the mixture was transferred into an autoclave, which was then put into a furnace and maintained at 180 oC for 24 h.After the autoclave cooled naturally down to room temperature in air, the resultant white precipitate was separated by centrifugation, washed with ethanol and pure water for several times to remove the organic residual, and finally dried overnight in vacuum oven at 65 oC. The porous ZnO nanoplates were prepared based on the previous report with minor modification 30.Typically, the porous ZnO nanoplates with defects were achieved by annealing the as-synthesized ZnS(en)0.5 precursor at different temperature (600, 650 and 700 oC) for 2 h in air, which were denoted as ZnO-600, ZnO-650 and ZnO-700, respectively.

SEM images of the as-synthesized ZnO samples are shown in Fig. 2. Plate-like morphology with porous structures are clearly observed.Obviously, the porosity of the samples decreases with the increase of annealing temperature.TEM images also indicate the formation of porous nanoplate morphology (Fig. 3 and Fig. S3).Moreover, a clear inter-planar spacing of 0.28 and 0.26 nm is observed in all the obtained ZnO samples from the HRTEM images, which is well indexed respectively to the d-spacing of (002) and (100) lattice planes of the Wurtzite ZnO.The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern with a bright diffraction spots indicates good single crystalline characteristic of the obtained porous ZnO nanoplates.The corresponding elemental mapping images of Zn and O of the ZnO-600 sample are also shown in Fig. 3, and those of ZnO-650 and ZnO-700 are given in Fig. S4.Clearly, the Zn and O elements are homogeneously distributed in the whole nanoplates for all the obtained ZnO samples. Photocatalytic reduction of CO2 in water under white light irradiation is performed to evaluate the activity of the obtained porous ZnO nanoplates.The main photoreduction product over all the obtained ZnO samples is CO.Blank experiments are also conducted (i.e., without CO2, illumination or photocatalysts), no any photoreduction products like CH4 or CO can be observed, confirming that the observed CO is indeed from CO2 photoreduction.Fig. 4 shows the CO production as a function of illumination time.Obviously, the amount of CO increases as the illumination time prolongs for all the samples.The production yield of CO is 3.8, 3.1 and 2.5 mol/g for the catalyst of ZnO-600, ZnO-650 and ZnO-700, respectively.Thus, the ZnO-600 sample has the highest activity for CO2 photoreduction, followed by ZnO-650, and ZnO-700 shows the lowest activity.Transient photocurrent response results further confirm such a sequence in activity, i.e., the ZnO-600 sample has the largest photocurrent density under the same measurement conditions, followed by ZnO-650, and ZnO-700 is the lowest (Fig. 4b).Moreover, the photocurrent increases sharply once upon the samples are subject to the light illumination, while it decreases immediately when the light is switched off.This indicates the observed photocurrent response is indeed caused by the CO2 photoreduction. The first considered factors that may have an impact on the photoreduction activity are the light harvesting and conduction band (CB) potential, which are highly dependent on the alignment of energy levels of a photocatalyst.So UV-visible light absorption spectra of the obtained porous ZnO nanoplates are collected (Fig. 5) so as to determine the bandgap (Eg) based on the Kubelka-Munk method using Tauc plots derived from the corresponding absorption spectra (insets of Fig. 5).The obtained value of Eg for ZnO-600, ZnO-650 and ZnO-700 is 3.21, 3.24 and 3.25 eV, respectively.To determine the CB potential, the valence band maximum (VB) is first measured using XPS valence band spectra (Fig. 6a), which is about 2.87 eV for all the obtained ZnO samples.Given the work function of the XPS instrument used in this work is 4.62 eV and 0 V (vs SHE) corresponds to 4.60 eV (vs vacuum level), the CB potential for ZnO-600, ZnO-650 and ZnO-700 can thus be calculated to be 0.32,0.35 and 0.36 V (vs SHE), respectively.In addition, the flat band potential can be determined using the Mott-Schottky curves (Fig. 6b), which is 0.57, 0.54 and 0.55 V (vs SCE) for ZnO-600, ZnO-650 and ZnO-700, respectively.Therefore, the difference in the alignment of energy levels among all the obtained ZnO samples (specifically, the potential of CB and flat band, as well as Eg) is very small.Accordingly, another factor, here the defects in the nanocatalysts as discussed below, is suggested to play a major role in the observed different photoreduction activity. Chemical composition and atomic stoichiometry of the obtained ZnO samples are studied by energy dispersive X-ray diffraction (EDX), which are listed in Table S1.Obviously, both Zn and O exist in the porous ZnO nanoplates, which is further confirmed by the XPS survey spectra (Fig. S5).It is found that the respective atomic ratio of O/Zn from TEM-EDX analysis for ZnO-600, ZnO-650 and ZnO-700 is 0.65, 0.77 and 0.97, indicating that all the obtained samples are oxygen deficient.Although it is highly possible that many different types of defects related to oxygen deficiency can be present in the samples, here oxygen vacancy (VO) is used as a typical representative.So the amount of VO in ZnO decreases with the increase of the annealing temperature, which is further confirmed by Raman results (Fig. 7).Two strong peaks at 99 and 437 cm -1 are the characteristic Raman signals of Wurtzite ZnO and can be identified as the vibration mode of nonpolar optical phonons 37.Another strong peak at 590 cm -1 is ascribed to the contribution of VO 38,39.The ratio of peak intensity I590/I437 can thus be used to represent the change in the amount of VO, which decreases with increase of annealing temperature, consistent with the EDX results.Based on the aforementioned discussion, the observed difference in the photoreduction activity for all the samples can thus be elucidated.It is generally believed that the adsorption and activation of CO2 that can strongly affect the reaction pathway and dynamics 24,25 are the first essential steps to initiate the subsequent photoreduction reactions, which are highly dependent on the vacancy defects of the photocatalyst surface.For this concern, the adsorption isotherms are carried out to investigate the CO2 adsorption property of the samples (Fig. 8a).It is found that the ZnO-600 sample has the largest CO2 adsorption capacity under the same pressure, followed by ZnO-650, and ZnO-700 is the lowest.DFT calculation is used to calculate the adsorption energy (EAds) so as to further study the influence of defects on the adsorption behavior of CO2 onto the clean surface and VO defect on ZnO surface.Each adsorbed structure is optimized and the most energetically favorable configuration is shown in Fig. 8b.The corresponding adsorption energy is calculated to be 0.55 and 0.60 eV for the CO2 adsorption energy on the clean surface and VO defect on ZnO surface, respectively (Table S2).The more negative value of EAds, the stronger the adsorption is.So the defect can facilitate the CO2 adsorption compared to the perfect surface.This explains well why the CO2 adsorption capacity on ZnO decreases with the increase of annealing temperature, resulting in the decreased activity for CO2 photoreduction. As for the activation of CO2, it is known that huge amount of energy is required to change the CO2 molecule from linear to bent.Thus, the activation energy may be dropped down to some degree if the configuration of a linear CO2 molecule (i.e., bond angle and length) can be distorted upon adsorption.Compared with the experimental value of 180 for the bond angle of a free CO2 molecule, it changes respectively to 176.5 and 174.7 according to the DFT calculation when CO2 is adsorbed on the clean surface and VO defect (Table S2).Meanwhile, the bond length of the two chemical bonds in CO2 becomes asymmetric, i.e., changes from 0.1176/0.1176nm to 0.1175/0.1178and 0.1171/0.1182nm for the clean surface and VO defect on ZnO surface, respectively.Thus, the distortion of CO2 configuration occurs upon adsorption on the surface, and the distortion degree for that on the VO defect is larger than that on the clean surface.In other words, the adsorption onto a surface is in favor of the CO2 activation, and the presence of defects can further facilitate the activation compared to the clean surface, leading to the improved photoreduction activity.In addition, it is known that the defects can have an impact on the separation of photogenerated charge carriers and, thereby, on the photocatalytic activity of the semiconductor catalysts.It can be concluded from Fig. 4b that the ZnO-600 sample has the highest efficiency for charge separation, followed by ZnO-650, and ZnO-700 is the lowest.This is further confirmed by the time-resolved PL results (Fig. 9).It is found that all the samples display exponential decay and can be fitted by the tri-exponential decay kinetics.The lifetime is composed of three different processes, non-radiative process (1), radiative process (2) and energy transfer process (3) 404142.Obviously, the values of PL lifetime for all these three processes decrease with the increase of annealing temperature (Table S3).This is because the defects can serve as the separation centers of charge carriers.As discussed above, the amount of VO defects decreases with increase of annealing temperature.So the ZnO-600 sample has the highest separation efficiency of charge carriers, followed by ZnO-650, and ZnO-700 exhibits the lowest separation efficiency, giving rise the enhanced photocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction."}], "lamp": [{"llm generation": "Xenon", "source": "The photoreduction of CO2 was conducted in a quartz reactor illuminated by UV-vis light with a 300 W Xe lamp (PLS-SXE300) under constant stirring.", "context": "All the chemicals were analytical reagent and were used without any further purification.Zinc powder (AR) and ethylenediamine ( 99) were bought from Shanghai Aladdin Biological Technology Co., Ltd.Sulfur powder and absolute ethanol ( 99.7) were purchased from Beijing Chemical Works.The pure water used in the experiment was acquired by a Milli-Q Plus system (Millipore, France) with 18.2 Mcm resistivity.
