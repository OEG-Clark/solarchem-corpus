The XRD results showed that CNT, GP, EG and AC had the hexagonal structure and their identified peaks are sharp at around 2h 26.4,corresponding to 0 0 2 with an interlayer spacing of 0.34 nm.In the meantime, the crystalline AgBr was found in the fresh carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites at around 2h 26.7,30.9, 44.3, and 55.0, indicating a hexagonal structure for the synthesized AgBr according to the report by Rodrigues and Martyanov et al. 23.In our synthesis process, a large quantity of the silver species can be precipitated and deposited by CTAB, since the amount of bromide species from CTAB is more than sufficient than that of silver species.In addition, XRD pattern of the used carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites after 5 h visible light irradiation with a 150 W Xe lamp was almost the same as that of fresh carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites. The diffraction peaks which are assigned to metallic Ag (38.2, 44.4, 64.4, and 77.4) were not detected in both of fresh and used carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites.Earlier studies reported that the irradiation led to the appearance of metallic Ag, for example, 1.2 wt. Ag was formed after 14 h irradiation in AgBr/TiO 2 6, however there are still some reports related to photostability without any formation of Ag for AgI/TiO 2 13 and AgCl/TiO 2 14 photocatalyst as well.Fig. 3 showed TEM images of carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites.It can be seen that AgBr nanoparticles with a size of 5-10 nm are deposited on the surface of carbonbased materials, indicating that AgBr nanoparticles were dispersed well on the surface of carbon-based materials (small black dots overlapped with parts of carbon-based supporting materials).It is believed that this deposition of AgBr with carbon-based supporting materials was beneficial to the charge transfer between the interface of carbon and AgBr nanoparticles. To investigate the optical properties, AgBr and carbonbased AgBr nanocomposites were analyzed by UV-Vis absorption spectra in the wavelength range of 250-800 nm and the absorption spectra of AgBr and carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites are shown in Fig. 4. It can be seen that AgBr shows an absorption edge at 470 nm (an indirect band gap of 2.64 eV), which can be applied in photocatalytic reaction by coupling some supporting materials.Thus, AgBr/TiO 2 catalysts had a substantial red shifting of the absorption edge due to dispersed AgBr as well as a better optical absorption generally in the visible region of 400-700 nm, compared to TiO 2 catalysts.With respect to carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites, it is difficult to observe the shift of band gap due to the strong absorption of the black supporting materials.However, it should be noted that all carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites had better optical absorption generally in the visible light range.Thus, it is believed that the better optical absorption of carbon-based AgBr composites in the visible light range is an essential condition to obtain the high photocatalytic performance under visible light.the conduction band of TiO 2 (A0.5 eV) 3.The potential for the reducing CO 2 -CH 3 OH, CH 4 , and CO was A0.38, A0.24, and A0.53 V versus NHE, respectively.Therefore, the conduction band of the semiconductor was more negative than the reduction potential of CO 2 , leading to the reduction of CO 2 to hydrocarbons.Moreover, the product yield under visible light for 5 h increased in the order of AgBr/GP AgBr/ CNT AgBr/EG AgBr/AC, in which AgBr/GP produces a maximum yield of methane, methanol, ethanol, and CO with 156.11, 94.44, 16.13, and 39.02 lmol g A1 , respectively.The different activity is probably related to the electron transfer from the conduction band of AgBr to different carbon supporting materials.Experimental results demonstrate that AgBr/GP and AgBr/CNT are the effective catalysts compared with AgBr/EG and AgBr/AC possibly due to the excellent conductivity of GP. Pioneer research groups investigated the zeolite 31 and titanium dioxide 6,13 on the efficiency for AgBr.Therefore, we also compared the catalytic activity of carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites for photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with AgBr/TiO 2 and AgBr/zeolite.The results shown in Fig. 5b illustrated a significant yield of photoreduction products for AgBr/GP compared with that of AgBr/TiO 2 and AgBr/zeolite.This result may help in providing optimal catalytic structure which reduces carbon dioxide under visible light with a relatively higher reduction yield. Since the photoreduction process of CO 2 involved H. radicals and carbon dioxide anion radicals formed by electron transfer from the conduction band 27,29,33, the pH value was crucial in the photoreduction of CO 2 .It can be seen from Fig. 6 that the yield of photocatalytic products for CO 2 reduction using carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites is dependent on the pH value.Firstly, the product yield of CO 2 reduction for four carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites increased with the pH value up to 8.5, and then decreased upon the further increase in the pH value.Obviously, the neutral and weak alkaline pH value is beneficial to the photoreduction of CO 2 .This can be explained by the following reasons: (1) The OH A ions in aqueous solution could act as strong hole-scavengers and reduce the recombination of hole-electron pairs 15, beneficial to facilitate the reduction of CO 2 .In contrast, H in aqueous solution could be involved in the electron competition with CO 2 reduction (i.e.H eA fi HAE), leading to lesser yields of hydrocarbons 27.(2) More CO 2 can be dissolved in basic solution to form HCO 3 ions (i.e.CO 2 OH A fi HCO 3 A ) than pure water or acidic solution 26, resulting in higher yields of hydrocarbons in the photoreduction process.(3) The neutral and weak alkaline pH value is beneficial to the adsorption of CO 2 on the catalyst from the zeta potential result of carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites (Fig. 7).It can be seen that the electrostatic force existed between carbonic ions and carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites due to positively charged carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites at pH 6.0, while the electrostatic repulsive force existed between CO 2 and carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites due to negatively charged carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites at pH 6.0.A relatively higher photocatalytic reduction activity was achieved in the neutral and weak alkaline pH range, representing the overall combined effect of the higher concentration of OH A ions but lower electrostatic repulsive force. The practical application of such a photocatalyst is the major scale which determines the photocatalyst efficiency, at the same time not only the photocatalytic activity of a catalyst is important, but its stability is also critical, since AgBr as a component of carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites is a photosensitive material.Alternatively, both GP-based AgBr nanocomposites and AgBr were tested for their repeated uses and stability for CO 2 photocatalytic reduction in aqueous solution.It can be seen from Fig. 8a that GP-based AgBr nanocomposites kept the photocatalyst stability during 5 repeated uses.AgBr/GP retained its yield of methane, methanol, ethanol, and CO in 5 repeated uses at 147.18 7.04, 86.59 6.07, 12.71 2.51, and 33.74 4.95 lmol g A1 , respectively.The total yields of the photocatalytic products on AgBr/GP after the 5 repeated uses remained about 83 of the first run.The re- sults indicated that AgBr/GP is an effective and chemical-stable catalyst.However, AgBr demonstrated a significant decline of product yield after 3 repeated uses from 36.73 to 0 lmol g A1 for methane, 32.16 to 3.71 lmol g A1 for methanol, 6.49 to 1.46 lmol g A1 for ethanol, and 9.18 to 0 lmol g A1 for CO, respectively (Fig. 8b).The total yields of the photocatalytic products on AgBr after the 3 repeated uses decreased to about 6 of the first run. Furthermore, the used AgBr and AgBr/GP after repeated uses were examined by XRD measurement.Fig. 9 showed the XRD patterns of the fresh and used AgBr.It can be seen clearly that the crystalline Ag can be found in the used AgBr at around 2h 38.2(Fig.9b) compared to that of fresh AgBr (Fig. 9a), indicating the formation of metallic Ag through the photographic process under visible light irradiation.This result indicated that the decreased activity of pure AgBr is ascribed to the decomposition of the catalyst.However, with respect to AgBr/GP, the XRD results show that AgBr/GP after repeated use appeared to display no changes as before, indicating that AgBr nanoparticles well-dispersed on GP can maintain their stability and photocatalytic activity.In this photocatalytic process, the transfer of photoexcited electrons from the conduction band of well-dispersed AgBr to carbonbased materials is beneficial for the stability of significant advantage for CO 2 photocatalytic reduction.Therefore, in practice, the stability of carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites would be a significant advantage for CO 2 photocatalytic reduction under visible light. Further electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) experiments were carried out to explain the reasons of the high photocatalytic activity and stability of the as-prepared carbon-based AgBr nanocomposite photocatalyst.EIS measurements of carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites were conducted under visible light to understand the electron transfer process in the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 reduction.The impedance data were collected for nanocomposite electrodes in 0.1 M KCl liquid at pH 5.8 (Fig. 10).It can be seen that only one arc appeared on the Nyquist plot of EIS for all electrodes under visible light conditions, suggesting a simple electrode process under our experimental conditions.The arc radius on EIS Nyquist plot of nanocomposites was of the order of AgBr/GP AgBr/CNT AgBr/EG AgBr/AC.Generally, the smaller the arc radius on the EIS Nyquist plot, the lower the charge transfer resistance.The EIS results demonstrated impedance order as AgBr/GP AgBr/ CNT AgBr/EG AgBr/AC.Thus, the electron accepting and transporting properties of GP and CNT in carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites were much faster than that of EG and AC in carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites, which could be beneficial to the suppression of charge recombination, thereby the highest rate in catalytic reduction of CO 2 for AgAgBr/ CNT-L would be achieved.In addition, the process of electron transfer is faster than the electron-hole recombination between valence band and conduction band of AgBr, thus plenty of CB-electrons (AgBr) can be stored on the surface of carbonbased supporting materials to be reacted later with CO 2 .Thus, the timely electron capture on the surface of carbon-based supporting materials plays another important role in the stability of carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites."}, {"llm generation": "TiO2", "source": "Thus, AgBr/TiO 2 catalysts had a substantial red shifting of the absorption edge due to dispersed AgBr as well as a better optical absorption generally in the visible region of 400-700 nm, compared to TiO 2 catalysts.", "context": "The prepared fresh carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites were first examined by XRD as shown in Fig. 2.

The XRD results showed that CNT, GP, EG and AC had the hexagonal structure and their identified peaks are sharp at around 2h 26.4,corresponding to 0 0 2 with an interlayer spacing of 0.34 nm.In the meantime, the crystalline AgBr was found in the fresh carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites at around 2h 26.7,30.9, 44.3, and 55.0, indicating a hexagonal structure for the synthesized AgBr according to the report by Rodrigues and Martyanov et al. 23.In our synthesis process, a large quantity of the silver species can be precipitated and deposited by CTAB, since the amount of bromide species from CTAB is more than sufficient than that of silver species.In addition, XRD pattern of the used carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites after 5 h visible light irradiation with a 150 W Xe lamp was almost the same as that of fresh carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites. The diffraction peaks which are assigned to metallic Ag (38.2, 44.4, 64.4, and 77.4) were not detected in both of fresh and used carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites.Earlier studies reported that the irradiation led to the appearance of metallic Ag, for example, 1.2 wt. Ag was formed after 14 h irradiation in AgBr/TiO 2 6, however there are still some reports related to photostability without any formation of Ag for AgI/TiO 2 13 and AgCl/TiO 2 14 photocatalyst as well.Fig. 3 showed TEM images of carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites.It can be seen that AgBr nanoparticles with a size of 5-10 nm are deposited on the surface of carbonbased materials, indicating that AgBr nanoparticles were dispersed well on the surface of carbon-based materials (small black dots overlapped with parts of carbon-based supporting materials).It is believed that this deposition of AgBr with carbon-based supporting materials was beneficial to the charge transfer between the interface of carbon and AgBr nanoparticles. To investigate the optical properties, AgBr and carbonbased AgBr nanocomposites were analyzed by UV-Vis absorption spectra in the wavelength range of 250-800 nm and the absorption spectra of AgBr and carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites are shown in Fig. 4. It can be seen that AgBr shows an absorption edge at 470 nm (an indirect band gap of 2.64 eV), which can be applied in photocatalytic reaction by coupling some supporting materials.Thus, AgBr/TiO 2 catalysts had a substantial red shifting of the absorption edge due to dispersed AgBr as well as a better optical absorption generally in the visible region of 400-700 nm, compared to TiO 2 catalysts.With respect to carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites, it is difficult to observe the shift of band gap due to the strong absorption of the black supporting materials.However, it should be noted that all carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites had better optical absorption generally in the visible light range.Thus, it is believed that the better optical absorption of carbon-based AgBr composites in the visible light range is an essential condition to obtain the high photocatalytic performance under visible light.the conduction band of TiO 2 (A0.5 eV) 3.The potential for the reducing CO 2 -CH 3 OH, CH 4 , and CO was A0.38, A0.24, and A0.53 V versus NHE, respectively.Therefore, the conduction band of the semiconductor was more negative than the reduction potential of CO 2 , leading to the reduction of CO 2 to hydrocarbons.Moreover, the product yield under visible light for 5 h increased in the order of AgBr/GP AgBr/ CNT AgBr/EG AgBr/AC, in which AgBr/GP produces a maximum yield of methane, methanol, ethanol, and CO with 156.11, 94.44, 16.13, and 39.02 lmol g A1 , respectively.The different activity is probably related to the electron transfer from the conduction band of AgBr to different carbon supporting materials.Experimental results demonstrate that AgBr/GP and AgBr/CNT are the effective catalysts compared with AgBr/EG and AgBr/AC possibly due to the excellent conductivity of GP. Pioneer research groups investigated the zeolite 31 and titanium dioxide 6,13 on the efficiency for AgBr.Therefore, we also compared the catalytic activity of carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites for photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with AgBr/TiO 2 and AgBr/zeolite.The results shown in Fig. 5b illustrated a significant yield of photoreduction products for AgBr/GP compared with that of AgBr/TiO 2 and AgBr/zeolite.This result may help in providing optimal catalytic structure which reduces carbon dioxide under visible light with a relatively higher reduction yield. Since the photoreduction process of CO 2 involved H. radicals and carbon dioxide anion radicals formed by electron transfer from the conduction band 27,29,33, the pH value was crucial in the photoreduction of CO 2 .It can be seen from Fig. 6 that the yield of photocatalytic products for CO 2 reduction using carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites is dependent on the pH value.Firstly, the product yield of CO 2 reduction for four carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites increased with the pH value up to 8.5, and then decreased upon the further increase in the pH value.Obviously, the neutral and weak alkaline pH value is beneficial to the photoreduction of CO 2 .This can be explained by the following reasons: (1) The OH A ions in aqueous solution could act as strong hole-scavengers and reduce the recombination of hole-electron pairs 15, beneficial to facilitate the reduction of CO 2 .In contrast, H in aqueous solution could be involved in the electron competition with CO 2 reduction (i.e.H eA fi HAE), leading to lesser yields of hydrocarbons 27.(2) More CO 2 can be dissolved in basic solution to form HCO 3 ions (i.e.CO 2 OH A fi HCO 3 A ) than pure water or acidic solution 26, resulting in higher yields of hydrocarbons in the photoreduction process.(3) The neutral and weak alkaline pH value is beneficial to the adsorption of CO 2 on the catalyst from the zeta potential result of carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites (Fig. 7).It can be seen that the electrostatic force existed between carbonic ions and carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites due to positively charged carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites at pH 6.0, while the electrostatic repulsive force existed between CO 2 and carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites due to negatively charged carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites at pH 6.0.A relatively higher photocatalytic reduction activity was achieved in the neutral and weak alkaline pH range, representing the overall combined effect of the higher concentration of OH A ions but lower electrostatic repulsive force. The practical application of such a photocatalyst is the major scale which determines the photocatalyst efficiency, at the same time not only the photocatalytic activity of a catalyst is important, but its stability is also critical, since AgBr as a component of carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites is a photosensitive material.Alternatively, both GP-based AgBr nanocomposites and AgBr were tested for their repeated uses and stability for CO 2 photocatalytic reduction in aqueous solution.It can be seen from Fig. 8a that GP-based AgBr nanocomposites kept the photocatalyst stability during 5 repeated uses.AgBr/GP retained its yield of methane, methanol, ethanol, and CO in 5 repeated uses at 147.18 7.04, 86.59 6.07, 12.71 2.51, and 33.74 4.95 lmol g A1 , respectively.The total yields of the photocatalytic products on AgBr/GP after the 5 repeated uses remained about 83 of the first run.The re- sults indicated that AgBr/GP is an effective and chemical-stable catalyst.However, AgBr demonstrated a significant decline of product yield after 3 repeated uses from 36.73 to 0 lmol g A1 for methane, 32.16 to 3.71 lmol g A1 for methanol, 6.49 to 1.46 lmol g A1 for ethanol, and 9.18 to 0 lmol g A1 for CO, respectively (Fig. 8b).The total yields of the photocatalytic products on AgBr after the 3 repeated uses decreased to about 6 of the first run. Furthermore, the used AgBr and AgBr/GP after repeated uses were examined by XRD measurement.Fig. 9 showed the XRD patterns of the fresh and used AgBr.It can be seen clearly that the crystalline Ag can be found in the used AgBr at around 2h 38.2(Fig.9b) compared to that of fresh AgBr (Fig. 9a), indicating the formation of metallic Ag through the photographic process under visible light irradiation.This result indicated that the decreased activity of pure AgBr is ascribed to the decomposition of the catalyst.However, with respect to AgBr/GP, the XRD results show that AgBr/GP after repeated use appeared to display no changes as before, indicating that AgBr nanoparticles well-dispersed on GP can maintain their stability and photocatalytic activity.In this photocatalytic process, the transfer of photoexcited electrons from the conduction band of well-dispersed AgBr to carbonbased materials is beneficial for the stability of significant advantage for CO 2 photocatalytic reduction.Therefore, in practice, the stability of carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites would be a significant advantage for CO 2 photocatalytic reduction under visible light.

The XRD results showed that CNT, GP, EG and AC had the hexagonal structure and their identified peaks are sharp at around 2h 26.4,corresponding to 0 0 2 with an interlayer spacing of 0.34 nm.In the meantime, the crystalline AgBr was found in the fresh carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites at around 2h 26.7,30.9, 44.3, and 55.0, indicating a hexagonal structure for the synthesized AgBr according to the report by Rodrigues and Martyanov et al. 23.In our synthesis process, a large quantity of the silver species can be precipitated and deposited by CTAB, since the amount of bromide species from CTAB is more than sufficient than that of silver species.In addition, XRD pattern of the used carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites after 5 h visible light irradiation with a 150 W Xe lamp was almost the same as that of fresh carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites. The diffraction peaks which are assigned to metallic Ag (38.2, 44.4, 64.4, and 77.4) were not detected in both of fresh and used carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites.Earlier studies reported that the irradiation led to the appearance of metallic Ag, for example, 1.2 wt. Ag was formed after 14 h irradiation in AgBr/TiO 2 6, however there are still some reports related to photostability without any formation of Ag for AgI/TiO 2 13 and AgCl/TiO 2 14 photocatalyst as well.Fig. 3 showed TEM images of carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites.It can be seen that AgBr nanoparticles with a size of 5-10 nm are deposited on the surface of carbonbased materials, indicating that AgBr nanoparticles were dispersed well on the surface of carbon-based materials (small black dots overlapped with parts of carbon-based supporting materials).It is believed that this deposition of AgBr with carbon-based supporting materials was beneficial to the charge transfer between the interface of carbon and AgBr nanoparticles. To investigate the optical properties, AgBr and carbonbased AgBr nanocomposites were analyzed by UV-Vis absorption spectra in the wavelength range of 250-800 nm and the absorption spectra of AgBr and carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites are shown in Fig. 4. It can be seen that AgBr shows an absorption edge at 470 nm (an indirect band gap of 2.64 eV), which can be applied in photocatalytic reaction by coupling some supporting materials.Thus, AgBr/TiO 2 catalysts had a substantial red shifting of the absorption edge due to dispersed AgBr as well as a better optical absorption generally in the visible region of 400-700 nm, compared to TiO 2 catalysts.With respect to carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites, it is difficult to observe the shift of band gap due to the strong absorption of the black supporting materials.However, it should be noted that all carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites had better optical absorption generally in the visible light range.Thus, it is believed that the better optical absorption of carbon-based AgBr composites in the visible light range is an essential condition to obtain the high photocatalytic performance under visible light.the conduction band of TiO 2 (A0.5 eV) 3.The potential for the reducing CO 2 -CH 3 OH, CH 4 , and CO was A0.38, A0.24, and A0.53 V versus NHE, respectively.Therefore, the conduction band of the semiconductor was more negative than the reduction potential of CO 2 , leading to the reduction of CO 2 to hydrocarbons.Moreover, the product yield under visible light for 5 h increased in the order of AgBr/GP AgBr/ CNT AgBr/EG AgBr/AC, in which AgBr/GP produces a maximum yield of methane, methanol, ethanol, and CO with 156.11, 94.44, 16.13, and 39.02 lmol g A1 , respectively.The different activity is probably related to the electron transfer from the conduction band of AgBr to different carbon supporting materials.Experimental results demonstrate that AgBr/GP and AgBr/CNT are the effective catalysts compared with AgBr/EG and AgBr/AC possibly due to the excellent conductivity of GP. Pioneer research groups investigated the zeolite 31 and titanium dioxide 6,13 on the efficiency for AgBr.Therefore, we also compared the catalytic activity of carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites for photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with AgBr/TiO 2 and AgBr/zeolite.The results shown in Fig. 5b illustrated a significant yield of photoreduction products for AgBr/GP compared with that of AgBr/TiO 2 and AgBr/zeolite.This result may help in providing optimal catalytic structure which reduces carbon dioxide under visible light with a relatively higher reduction yield. Since the photoreduction process of CO 2 involved H. radicals and carbon dioxide anion radicals formed by electron transfer from the conduction band 27,29,33, the pH value was crucial in the photoreduction of CO 2 .It can be seen from Fig. 6 that the yield of photocatalytic products for CO 2 reduction using carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites is dependent on the pH value.Firstly, the product yield of CO 2 reduction for four carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites increased with the pH value up to 8.5, and then decreased upon the further increase in the pH value.Obviously, the neutral and weak alkaline pH value is beneficial to the photoreduction of CO 2 .This can be explained by the following reasons: (1) The OH A ions in aqueous solution could act as strong hole-scavengers and reduce the recombination of hole-electron pairs 15, beneficial to facilitate the reduction of CO 2 .In contrast, H in aqueous solution could be involved in the electron competition with CO 2 reduction (i.e.H eA fi HAE), leading to lesser yields of hydrocarbons 27.(2) More CO 2 can be dissolved in basic solution to form HCO 3 ions (i.e.CO 2 OH A fi HCO 3 A ) than pure water or acidic solution 26, resulting in higher yields of hydrocarbons in the photoreduction process.(3) The neutral and weak alkaline pH value is beneficial to the adsorption of CO 2 on the catalyst from the zeta potential result of carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites (Fig. 7).It can be seen that the electrostatic force existed between carbonic ions and carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites due to positively charged carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites at pH 6.0, while the electrostatic repulsive force existed between CO 2 and carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites due to negatively charged carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites at pH 6.0.A relatively higher photocatalytic reduction activity was achieved in the neutral and weak alkaline pH range, representing the overall combined effect of the higher concentration of OH A ions but lower electrostatic repulsive force. The practical application of such a photocatalyst is the major scale which determines the photocatalyst efficiency, at the same time not only the photocatalytic activity of a catalyst is important, but its stability is also critical, since AgBr as a component of carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites is a photosensitive material.Alternatively, both GP-based AgBr nanocomposites and AgBr were tested for their repeated uses and stability for CO 2 photocatalytic reduction in aqueous solution.It can be seen from Fig. 8a that GP-based AgBr nanocomposites kept the photocatalyst stability during 5 repeated uses.AgBr/GP retained its yield of methane, methanol, ethanol, and CO in 5 repeated uses at 147.18 7.04, 86.59 6.07, 12.71 2.51, and 33.74 4.95 lmol g A1 , respectively.The total yields of the photocatalytic products on AgBr/GP after the 5 repeated uses remained about 83 of the first run.The re- sults indicated that AgBr/GP is an effective and chemical-stable catalyst.However, AgBr demonstrated a significant decline of product yield after 3 repeated uses from 36.73 to 0 lmol g A1 for methane, 32.16 to 3.71 lmol g A1 for methanol, 6.49 to 1.46 lmol g A1 for ethanol, and 9.18 to 0 lmol g A1 for CO, respectively (Fig. 8b).The total yields of the photocatalytic products on AgBr after the 3 repeated uses decreased to about 6 of the first run. Furthermore, the used AgBr and AgBr/GP after repeated uses were examined by XRD measurement.Fig. 9 showed the XRD patterns of the fresh and used AgBr.It can be seen clearly that the crystalline Ag can be found in the used AgBr at around 2h 38.2(Fig.9b) compared to that of fresh AgBr (Fig. 9a), indicating the formation of metallic Ag through the photographic process under visible light irradiation.This result indicated that the decreased activity of pure AgBr is ascribed to the decomposition of the catalyst.However, with respect to AgBr/GP, the XRD results show that AgBr/GP after repeated use appeared to display no changes as before, indicating that AgBr nanoparticles well-dispersed on GP can maintain their stability and photocatalytic activity.In this photocatalytic process, the transfer of photoexcited electrons from the conduction band of well-dispersed AgBr to carbonbased materials is beneficial for the stability of significant advantage for CO 2 photocatalytic reduction.Therefore, in practice, the stability of carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites would be a significant advantage for CO 2 photocatalytic reduction under visible light. Further electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) experiments were carried out to explain the reasons of the high photocatalytic activity and stability of the as-prepared carbon-based AgBr nanocomposite photocatalyst.EIS measurements of carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites were conducted under visible light to understand the electron transfer process in the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 reduction.The impedance data were collected for nanocomposite electrodes in 0.1 M KCl liquid at pH 5.8 (Fig. 10).It can be seen that only one arc appeared on the Nyquist plot of EIS for all electrodes under visible light conditions, suggesting a simple electrode process under our experimental conditions.The arc radius on EIS Nyquist plot of nanocomposites was of the order of AgBr/GP AgBr/CNT AgBr/EG AgBr/AC.Generally, the smaller the arc radius on the EIS Nyquist plot, the lower the charge transfer resistance.The EIS results demonstrated impedance order as AgBr/GP AgBr/ CNT AgBr/EG AgBr/AC.Thus, the electron accepting and transporting properties of GP and CNT in carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites were much faster than that of EG and AC in carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites, which could be beneficial to the suppression of charge recombination, thereby the highest rate in catalytic reduction of CO 2 for AgAgBr/ CNT-L would be achieved.In addition, the process of electron transfer is faster than the electron-hole recombination between valence band and conduction band of AgBr, thus plenty of CB-electrons (AgBr) can be stored on the surface of carbonbased supporting materials to be reacted later with CO 2 .Thus, the timely electron capture on the surface of carbon-based supporting materials plays another important role in the stability of carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites."}, {"llm generation": "Xenon", "source": "Figure 1 Schematic diagram of photocatalytic reduction system: (1) CO 2 gas cylinder; (2) flow meter; (3) pressure digital meter; (4) stainless steel vessel; (5) O-ring glass window; (6) Xe lamp; (7) cooling system; (8) gas sampling; (9) liquid sampling; (10) magnetic stirrer; V 1 , V 2 , V 3 , and V 4 are valves.", "context": "In this work, the catalytic activities of carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites for CO 2 reduction to hydrocarbons under visible light were investigated.The carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites were prepared by the deposition-precipitation method in the presence of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB).The photocatalytic activities of carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites were evaluated by the reduction yield in the presence of CO 2 and water under visible light (k 420 nm).The experiment results showed that AgBr/GP and AgBr/CNT had a rel- atively higher reduction yield under visible light compared with AgBr/EG and AgBr/AC.Moreover, it was found that the carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites were stable in the repeated uses under visible light due to the transfer of photoexcited electrons from the conduction band of well-dispersed AgBr to carbon supporting materials.This investigation in the present work demonstrated that the catalytic activity of carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites can be utilized in the CO 2 reduction to hydrocarbons under visible light.Thus, the study, using carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites to reduce CO 2 under visible light, will enrich the fundamental theory not only for efficient CO 2 conversion and fixation, storage of solar energy, but also for solving environmental problems.

Fig. 5a illustrated the dependence of CO 2 reduction yield on the different supporting materials.It can be seen that the photocatalytic products, i.e. methane, methanol, CO and ethanol, were formed in the photocatalysis using different carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites.Indeed, the conduction band of AgBr is located at A1.04 eV versus NHE, which is more cathodic than Figure4UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of photocatalysts absorbance vs. light-absorbed wavelength.

The XRD results showed that CNT, GP, EG and AC had the hexagonal structure and their identified peaks are sharp at around 2h 26.4,corresponding to 0 0 2 with an interlayer spacing of 0.34 nm.In the meantime, the crystalline AgBr was found in the fresh carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites at around 2h 26.7,30.9, 44.3, and 55.0, indicating a hexagonal structure for the synthesized AgBr according to the report by Rodrigues and Martyanov et al. 23.In our synthesis process, a large quantity of the silver species can be precipitated and deposited by CTAB, since the amount of bromide species from CTAB is more than sufficient than that of silver species.In addition, XRD pattern of the used carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites after 5 h visible light irradiation with a 150 W Xe lamp was almost the same as that of fresh carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites. The diffraction peaks which are assigned to metallic Ag (38.2, 44.4, 64.4, and 77.4) were not detected in both of fresh and used carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites.Earlier studies reported that the irradiation led to the appearance of metallic Ag, for example, 1.2 wt. Ag was formed after 14 h irradiation in AgBr/TiO 2 6, however there are still some reports related to photostability without any formation of Ag for AgI/TiO 2 13 and AgCl/TiO 2 14 photocatalyst as well.Fig. 3 showed TEM images of carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites.It can be seen that AgBr nanoparticles with a size of 5-10 nm are deposited on the surface of carbonbased materials, indicating that AgBr nanoparticles were dispersed well on the surface of carbon-based materials (small black dots overlapped with parts of carbon-based supporting materials).It is believed that this deposition of AgBr with carbon-based supporting materials was beneficial to the charge transfer between the interface of carbon and AgBr nanoparticles. To investigate the optical properties, AgBr and carbonbased AgBr nanocomposites were analyzed by UV-Vis absorption spectra in the wavelength range of 250-800 nm and the absorption spectra of AgBr and carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites are shown in Fig. 4. It can be seen that AgBr shows an absorption edge at 470 nm (an indirect band gap of 2.64 eV), which can be applied in photocatalytic reaction by coupling some supporting materials.Thus, AgBr/TiO 2 catalysts had a substantial red shifting of the absorption edge due to dispersed AgBr as well as a better optical absorption generally in the visible region of 400-700 nm, compared to TiO 2 catalysts.With respect to carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites, it is difficult to observe the shift of band gap due to the strong absorption of the black supporting materials.However, it should be noted that all carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites had better optical absorption generally in the visible light range.Thus, it is believed that the better optical absorption of carbon-based AgBr composites in the visible light range is an essential condition to obtain the high photocatalytic performance under visible light.the conduction band of TiO 2 (A0.5 eV) 3.The potential for the reducing CO 2 -CH 3 OH, CH 4 , and CO was A0.38, A0.24, and A0.53 V versus NHE, respectively.Therefore, the conduction band of the semiconductor was more negative than the reduction potential of CO 2 , leading to the reduction of CO 2 to hydrocarbons.Moreover, the product yield under visible light for 5 h increased in the order of AgBr/GP AgBr/ CNT AgBr/EG AgBr/AC, in which AgBr/GP produces a maximum yield of methane, methanol, ethanol, and CO with 156.11, 94.44, 16.13, and 39.02 lmol g A1 , respectively.The different activity is probably related to the electron transfer from the conduction band of AgBr to different carbon supporting materials.Experimental results demonstrate that AgBr/GP and AgBr/CNT are the effective catalysts compared with AgBr/EG and AgBr/AC possibly due to the excellent conductivity of GP. Pioneer research groups investigated the zeolite 31 and titanium dioxide 6,13 on the efficiency for AgBr.Therefore, we also compared the catalytic activity of carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites for photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with AgBr/TiO 2 and AgBr/zeolite.The results shown in Fig. 5b illustrated a significant yield of photoreduction products for AgBr/GP compared with that of AgBr/TiO 2 and AgBr/zeolite.This result may help in providing optimal catalytic structure which reduces carbon dioxide under visible light with a relatively higher reduction yield. Since the photoreduction process of CO 2 involved H. radicals and carbon dioxide anion radicals formed by electron transfer from the conduction band 27,29,33, the pH value was crucial in the photoreduction of CO 2 .It can be seen from Fig. 6 that the yield of photocatalytic products for CO 2 reduction using carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites is dependent on the pH value.Firstly, the product yield of CO 2 reduction for four carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites increased with the pH value up to 8.5, and then decreased upon the further increase in the pH value.Obviously, the neutral and weak alkaline pH value is beneficial to the photoreduction of CO 2 .This can be explained by the following reasons: (1) The OH A ions in aqueous solution could act as strong hole-scavengers and reduce the recombination of hole-electron pairs 15, beneficial to facilitate the reduction of CO 2 .In contrast, H in aqueous solution could be involved in the electron competition with CO 2 reduction (i.e.H eA fi HAE), leading to lesser yields of hydrocarbons 27.(2) More CO 2 can be dissolved in basic solution to form HCO 3 ions (i.e.CO 2 OH A fi HCO 3 A ) than pure water or acidic solution 26, resulting in higher yields of hydrocarbons in the photoreduction process.(3) The neutral and weak alkaline pH value is beneficial to the adsorption of CO 2 on the catalyst from the zeta potential result of carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites (Fig. 7).It can be seen that the electrostatic force existed between carbonic ions and carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites due to positively charged carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites at pH 6.0, while the electrostatic repulsive force existed between CO 2 and carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites due to negatively charged carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites at pH 6.0.A relatively higher photocatalytic reduction activity was achieved in the neutral and weak alkaline pH range, representing the overall combined effect of the higher concentration of OH A ions but lower electrostatic repulsive force. The practical application of such a photocatalyst is the major scale which determines the photocatalyst efficiency, at the same time not only the photocatalytic activity of a catalyst is important, but its stability is also critical, since AgBr as a component of carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites is a photosensitive material.Alternatively, both GP-based AgBr nanocomposites and AgBr were tested for their repeated uses and stability for CO 2 photocatalytic reduction in aqueous solution.It can be seen from Fig. 8a that GP-based AgBr nanocomposites kept the photocatalyst stability during 5 repeated uses.AgBr/GP retained its yield of methane, methanol, ethanol, and CO in 5 repeated uses at 147.18 7.04, 86.59 6.07, 12.71 2.51, and 33.74 4.95 lmol g A1 , respectively.The total yields of the photocatalytic products on AgBr/GP after the 5 repeated uses remained about 83 of the first run.The re- sults indicated that AgBr/GP is an effective and chemical-stable catalyst.However, AgBr demonstrated a significant decline of product yield after 3 repeated uses from 36.73 to 0 lmol g A1 for methane, 32.16 to 3.71 lmol g A1 for methanol, 6.49 to 1.46 lmol g A1 for ethanol, and 9.18 to 0 lmol g A1 for CO, respectively (Fig. 8b).The total yields of the photocatalytic products on AgBr after the 3 repeated uses decreased to about 6 of the first run. Furthermore, the used AgBr and AgBr/GP after repeated uses were examined by XRD measurement.Fig. 9 showed the XRD patterns of the fresh and used AgBr.It can be seen clearly that the crystalline Ag can be found in the used AgBr at around 2h 38.2(Fig.9b) compared to that of fresh AgBr (Fig. 9a), indicating the formation of metallic Ag through the photographic process under visible light irradiation.This result indicated that the decreased activity of pure AgBr is ascribed to the decomposition of the catalyst.However, with respect to AgBr/GP, the XRD results show that AgBr/GP after repeated use appeared to display no changes as before, indicating that AgBr nanoparticles well-dispersed on GP can maintain their stability and photocatalytic activity.In this photocatalytic process, the transfer of photoexcited electrons from the conduction band of well-dispersed AgBr to carbonbased materials is beneficial for the stability of significant advantage for CO 2 photocatalytic reduction.Therefore, in practice, the stability of carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites would be a significant advantage for CO 2 photocatalytic reduction under visible light. Further electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) experiments were carried out to explain the reasons of the high photocatalytic activity and stability of the as-prepared carbon-based AgBr nanocomposite photocatalyst.EIS measurements of carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites were conducted under visible light to understand the electron transfer process in the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 reduction.The impedance data were collected for nanocomposite electrodes in 0.1 M KCl liquid at pH 5.8 (Fig. 10).It can be seen that only one arc appeared on the Nyquist plot of EIS for all electrodes under visible light conditions, suggesting a simple electrode process under our experimental conditions.The arc radius on EIS Nyquist plot of nanocomposites was of the order of AgBr/GP AgBr/CNT AgBr/EG AgBr/AC.Generally, the smaller the arc radius on the EIS Nyquist plot, the lower the charge transfer resistance.The EIS results demonstrated impedance order as AgBr/GP AgBr/ CNT AgBr/EG AgBr/AC.Thus, the electron accepting and transporting properties of GP and CNT in carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites were much faster than that of EG and AC in carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites, which could be beneficial to the suppression of charge recombination, thereby the highest rate in catalytic reduction of CO 2 for AgAgBr/ CNT-L would be achieved.In addition, the process of electron transfer is faster than the electron-hole recombination between valence band and conduction band of AgBr, thus plenty of CB-electrons (AgBr) can be stored on the surface of carbonbased supporting materials to be reacted later with CO 2 .Thus, the timely electron capture on the surface of carbon-based supporting materials plays another important role in the stability of carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites."}, {"llm generation": "Liquid", "source": "The impedance data were collected for nanocomposite electrodes in 0.1 M KCl liquid at pH 5.8 (Fig. 10).", "context": "The prepared fresh carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites were first examined by XRD as shown in Fig. 2.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained with a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEM-2010HR).The content of AgBr in the catalyst was determined by SEM-EDS-EBSD thermal field emission scanning electron microscope (JEOL, Japan).AgBr/CBM powders were then examined by a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEM-2010HR).The EIS measurements were carried out using a potentiostat/galvanostat (Autolab, PGSTAT302N) coupled to a lock-in amplifier (PGSTAT 302N).The impedance data were collected as a function of frequency scanned from the highest (1000 Hz) to the lowest (0.001 Hz) using the ''single-sine'' (lock-in amplifier) method.The measurements were conducted in a conventional H-type electrochemical Pyrex cell with a standard three-electrode assembly.This assembly had a AgBr nanocomposite working electrode, a Pt wire as a counter electrode (area, 0.5 1.0 cm 2 ), and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as a reference electrode. Photocatalytic reduction was carried out in a stainless steel vessel with valves for evacuation and gas feeding as shown in Fig. 1, in which an O-ring sealed glass window was placed at the top for admitting light irradiation.A 150 W Xe lamp (Shanghai Aojia Lighting Appliance Co., Ltd.) with UV cutoff filter (providing visible light with k 420 nm) was used for irradiation.In a typical batch, 0.5 g of prepared carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites was suspended in 100 mL of 0.2 M KHCO 3 solution in the vessel.Prior to the irradiation, pure CO 2 (99.99) was passed via a flow controller through the solution for 30 min to remove the oxygen, and then closed maintaining a pressure of 7.5 MPa inside the reactor.During the reaction, the powders were continuously agitated to prevent the sedimentation of the catalyst by a magnetic stirrer, and the photocatalytic reaction conducted lasted for 5 h at room temperature.After illumination, small aliquots of the suspension were withdrawn by syringe, filtered through Millipore membranes, and then analyzed.Gas samples were performed with a gas-tight syringe through a septum.Reaction products in liquid phase were analyzed using a gas chromatography (Agilent HP6890N) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a HP-5 capillary column (30 m 320 lm 0.50 mm).The product in gas phase was analyzed by GC/MS Hewlett-Packard (HP) 6890 gas chromatography with a HP 5973 mass detector.A 60 m length 0.32 mm I.D. 1.8 m film thickness HP-VOC column (Agilent Scientific, USA) was used.The oven was programed at following rates, the initial temperature of the column was 40 C hold for 2 min, followed by a ramp of 5 C min A1 to 120 C (1 min hold), injection model splitless, for 1 lL sample."}]}}
