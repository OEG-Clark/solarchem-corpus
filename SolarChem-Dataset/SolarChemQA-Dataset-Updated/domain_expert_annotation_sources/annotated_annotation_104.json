Table 1 summarizes the properties of the catalysts, and the particle sizes are consistent with the TEM observation illustrated in Fig. 2.This suggests that Ni 2 can suppress TiO 2 from anatase phase to rutile.N and Ni 2 not only could increase specific surface area, which is favorable to the catalytic reaction in comparison with 17:60 m 2 g of nano-TiO 2 , but also could effectively inhibit phase transformation from anatase to rutile, and growth in size and aggregation of the particle.The most important finding is that the band gap of TiO 2 is reduced, which results in fine photoresponse. The particle sizes of sol-gel derived N-NiTiO 2 are uniform and the diameter is between 10-15 nm; N-NiTiO 2 have good dispersion and crystallization compared to nano-TiO 2 (Fig. 2).N and Ni 2 could suppress the aggregation of the particles.It was reported in (Yu et al. 2006;Tseng et al. 2009) that Ni 2 can substitute Ti 4 because of the ionic radius of Ni 2 is close to that of Ti 4 ; accordingly, Ni 2 could enter into the lattice preventing the crystal growth.We know the existence of the Ni-O bond from Fig. 3, however, N doping favors oxygen vacancy formation (Livraghi et al. 2006), which could stop the aggregation of the particles.The electron diffraction patterns of the samples are instructive that N-NiTiO 2 are crystallized better than pure TiO 2 . Table 2 lists the element content of N-NiTiO 2 estimated from EDS patterns of N-NiTiO 2 (Fig. 4).Ti is substituted by Ni in the crystal, so the weight percentage of Ti element in the nano-TiO 2 is lower than 60, which is determined by the chemical formula of TiO 2 .The atomic percentage of O is higher for the existence of adsorbed oxygen on the surface of nano-TiO 2 . Fig. 3 presents the FTIR spectrum of TiO 2 , NTiO 2 , NiTiO 2 , and N-NiTiO 2 before annealing.The peak centered at 657:52 cm A1 is caused by vibration absorption of the Ti-O bands.The 3;402:71 cm A1 is characteristic peak of the OH-stretching vibration of free and hydrogen-bonded surface hydroxyl groups, the 1;640:84 cm A1 is caused by the H-O-H bending vibration of the physically adsorbed water.The peak at 2;956:78 cm A1 is caused by the stretching vibration of the CH 3 -and-CH 2 -, but it disappears in the N doped TiO 2 samples, thus further investigation is needed.The peak at 1;380:50 cm A1 belongs to Ni-O vibration absorption (Ji et al. 1989), which indicates that Ti 4 can be substituted by Ni 2 before annealing. Fig. 5 displays the TG-DSC curves of N-NiTiO 2 catalyst before annealing.A primary endothermic process appears in the DSC curves before 130C, which is attributed to the desorption of the water, n-butanol, and acetic acid in the gel, leading to a weight loss of 10.A rapid weight loss occurs from 200-400C with a weight loss of 35, which is attributed to the two small exothermic peaks between 250C and 330C, because of the decomposition of organic compounds in the gel.There is almost no weight loss after 500C, because the exothermic peak before 500C caused by the phase transformation of TiO 2 from anatase to rutile.The phase transformations of TiO 2 and NTiO 2 are approximately 450 and 420C, respectively, which can explain why rutile phase in NTiO 2 is found more often than that in pure-TiO 2 , according to the XRD study (Table 1). The optical absorption spectrum for pure TiO 2 , NTiO 2 , NiTiO 2 , and N-NiTiO 2 obtained by the diffuse reflection method are shown in Fig. 6.A noticeable shift in the absorption edge into the visible light region up to 430 nm was observed for N-NiTiO 2 , which had better photoresponsiveness.The Ni 2 doped TiO 2 absorbed more photons than N doped TiO 2 in the wavelength between 390 and 445 nm, but the photoresponsiveness was opposite in the other regions.This phenomenon may be related to the mechanism of the doping, although it is not certain.The absorption edge of doped TiO 2 shifts to longer wavelength in comparison with pure-TiO 2 (generally TiO 2 NiTiO 2 NTiO 2 N-NiTiO 2 in increasing order), which may result from the impurity energy level introduced by doping different elements in the TiO 2 crystal; the band gap of the samples is calculated by extrapolating a straight line to the abscissa at zero absorption (Sanchez et al. 1995). Table 3 summarizes the results of photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 using different photocatalysts under 8 h irradiation by UV sources and visible light.Obviously, light of 14 254 nm makes the photocatalysts more active than 14 365 nm and 14 400-780 nm, because the decreasing of means the increasing energy of the photon.From Table 3, we know that the catalysts of N and Ni 2 codoped TiO 2 had better photocatalytic performance than pure TiO 2 , and N and Ni 2 doped TiO 2 , especially under the light of 14 400-780 nm increases the methanol yield.It suggests that there is a synergistic effect of N and Ni 2 on nano-TiO 2 in photocatalytic reductions of CO 2 in combination with the UV-Vis analysis (Fig. 6). During the research we found better doping amounts for the N and Ni 2 , which were 4 and 6 (based on mass of TiO 2 ) for N and Ni 2 , respectively.Fig. 7 and 8 illustrate the effect of N and Ni 2 doping amounts on methanol yield of CO 2 ). When light energy larger than the TiO 2 band gap is absorbed by the TiO 2 particles, an electron (e A ) and positive hole (h ) are formed in the catalysts and located in the conduction and valence bands, respectively Eq. ( 1) ( Kaneco et al. 1997;Linsebigler et al. 1995).e A and h can redox with the species on the surface.There are two major shortcomings of the pure nano-TiO 2 crystal, one is the lower utilization of light-it captures less than 5 of all solar radiation at the earth's surface accurately; the other is low photocatalytic efficiency, induced by the recombination of e A and h before the trapping by appropriate active sites. One of the most promising and widely investigated photocatalysts is nitrogen-doped titanium dioxide (NTiO 2 ), but there are still differences views on the doping mechanism: 1. N replaces O at regular lattice site, forming impurity energy levels that are just on the top of the valence band; 2. N is hosted in an interstitial position and directly connects with O, forming impurity energy levels that are slightly higher in the gap; and 3. N doping favors oxygen vacancy formation (Ti 3 defects), forming a defect level that is slightly lower than the conduction band (Livraghi et al. 2006;Di Valention et al. 2005;Asahi et al. 2001).Because all the impurity energy levels of N doping are in the gap (higher than the valence band energy levels and lower than the conduction band energy levels) here, an intermediate energy level (IEL) is defined for discussion.The IEL can narrow the band gap of TiO 2 (Eg 3:2 eV), so the light response of TiO 2 increases and moves to the long-wavelength region. Recent studies reported that when the mass ratio of anatase phase and rutile phase was 73 in the mix-crystal structure results in the best photocatalytic activity (Chen et al. 2002).From Fig. 1 Table 3 and Table 1, we know that N doped TiO 2 contains more rutile phase and crystallizes better than the pure TiO 2 , so the light response of NTiO 2 is enhanced compared to pure TiO 2 .This may be because its mix-crystal structure is closer to 73 than pure TiO 2 .An obvious red shift is found in UV-V is absorption spectra of NTiO 2 (Fig. 6) and indicates that N doping can narrow the band gap of nano-TiO 2 because the of the IEL.Photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 experiments show that when using light ( 14 254 nm) irradiation, the methanol yield of NTiO 2 is 14.2 times higher than that of pure TiO 2 , while light ( 14 400-780 nm) irradiation, the methanol yield of NTiO 2 is 55.1 times higher than that of pure TiO 2 (Table 3), so N doping can greatly enhance the activity of light absorption.But when the doping amount of N is excess, N species may be piled together on the crystal surface of TiO 2 , reducing the specific surface area of TiO 2 . Since the ionic radius of Ni 2 is close to Ti 4 , Ti 4 can be substituted by Ni 2 .FTIR spectra (Fig. 3) have demonstrated the replacement of Ni 2 ions in the TiO 2 matrix, and a new impurity energy level may generate for the Ni-O bond, so that the threshold of light excitation has been reduced (Yu et al. 2006;Tseng et al. 2009;Kim et al. 2006).The Ni 2 may improve the photocatalytic activity of TiO 2 because Ni 2 acts as a probable electron trapper in TiO 2 Eq.( 2), reducing the chance of electron-hole recombination and ensuring a good separation of electron-hole pairs.Subsequently Ni could be oxidized to Ni 2 by transferring electrons to the active CO 2 species, facilitating the process of photoreduction of CO 2 Eq.( 3).However with higher concentration of Ni , it can serve as a recombination center Eq.( 4), because Ni and photogenerated holes are close to each other (Kim et al. 2006), hindering the generation of electrons for reduction of CO 2 and reducing the efficiency of the photocatalysis. The results of the experiments in Table 3 show us that N-NiTiO 2 is the best candidate for the photoreduction of CO 2 with the highest methanol yield in the same condition.We think the reasons for this are as follows: 1. N and Ni 2 codoped TiO 2 have smaller particle sizes, good crystals, and large special surface areas, which are favorable to the photoreaction; 2. The band gap of TiO 2 is narrowed for N doping, meaning the better absorption of visible light; and 3.The Ni 2 in the lattice can reduce the chances of electron and hole recombination, and the electrons can be easily transferred to the species on the surface of TiO 2 .The synergistic effect of N and Ni 2 in the lattice of TiO 2 leads to the best performance of methanol yield. NaOH aqueous is indispensable, because it a acts as hole-scavenger to reduce the recombination of electron and hole, and NaOH solution also dissolves more CO 2 than the pure water.Eqs. ( 3) and ( 5) show the source of the electron for the reduction reaction.Eq. ( 6) tells us that six electrons are required to covert the C 4 of CO 2 to the C 2A of CH 3 OH.In the reaction system, the oxidation and reduction take place simultaneously, and O 2 and OH are products that can oxidize methanol, so we added Na 2 SO 3 in the system which can be oxidized instead of CH 3 OH Eq.( 7)."}, {"llm generation": "N doped TiO2", "source": "N doped TiO 2 contains more rutile phase than the pure-TiO 2 ; no characteristic peaks appear in NiTiO 2 and N-NiTiO 2 .", "context": "The XRD of the catalysts in Fig. 1 shows that anatase is the major phase in nano-TiO 2 , which is the most active phase for photoreaction after calcinations at 500C.N doped TiO 2 contains more rutile phase than the pure-TiO 2 ; no characteristic peaks appear in NiTiO 2 and N-NiTiO 2 .This suggests that the distribution of Ni 2 is possibly continuous in the particles because the NiNO 3 2 6H 2 O was added before the hydrolysis of butyltitanate during the preparation (see \"Experimental Procedure\").The grain sizes of the catalyst are calculated from the Scherrer equation (2 14 25:14).

Table 2 lists the element content of N-NiTiO 2 estimated from EDS patterns of N-NiTiO 2 (Fig. 4).Ti is substituted by Ni in the crystal, so the weight percentage of Ti element in the nano-TiO 2 is lower than 60, which is determined by the chemical formula of TiO 2 .The atomic percentage of O is higher for the existence of adsorbed oxygen on the surface of nano-TiO 2 . Fig. 3 presents the FTIR spectrum of TiO 2 , NTiO 2 , NiTiO 2 , and N-NiTiO 2 before annealing.The peak centered at 657:52 cm A1 is caused by vibration absorption of the Ti-O bands.The 3;402:71 cm A1 is characteristic peak of the OH-stretching vibration of free and hydrogen-bonded surface hydroxyl groups, the 1;640:84 cm A1 is caused by the H-O-H bending vibration of the physically adsorbed water.The peak at 2;956:78 cm A1 is caused by the stretching vibration of the CH 3 -and-CH 2 -, but it disappears in the N doped TiO 2 samples, thus further investigation is needed.The peak at 1;380:50 cm A1 belongs to Ni-O vibration absorption (Ji et al. 1989), which indicates that Ti 4 can be substituted by Ni 2 before annealing. Fig. 5 displays the TG-DSC curves of N-NiTiO 2 catalyst before annealing.A primary endothermic process appears in the DSC curves before 130C, which is attributed to the desorption of the water, n-butanol, and acetic acid in the gel, leading to a weight loss of 10.A rapid weight loss occurs from 200-400C with a weight loss of 35, which is attributed to the two small exothermic peaks between 250C and 330C, because of the decomposition of organic compounds in the gel.There is almost no weight loss after 500C, because the exothermic peak before 500C caused by the phase transformation of TiO 2 from anatase to rutile.The phase transformations of TiO 2 and NTiO 2 are approximately 450 and 420C, respectively, which can explain why rutile phase in NTiO 2 is found more often than that in pure-TiO 2 , according to the XRD study (Table 1). The optical absorption spectrum for pure TiO 2 , NTiO 2 , NiTiO 2 , and N-NiTiO 2 obtained by the diffuse reflection method are shown in Fig. 6.A noticeable shift in the absorption edge into the visible light region up to 430 nm was observed for N-NiTiO 2 , which had better photoresponsiveness.The Ni 2 doped TiO 2 absorbed more photons than N doped TiO 2 in the wavelength between 390 and 445 nm, but the photoresponsiveness was opposite in the other regions.This phenomenon may be related to the mechanism of the doping, although it is not certain.The absorption edge of doped TiO 2 shifts to longer wavelength in comparison with pure-TiO 2 (generally TiO 2 NiTiO 2 NTiO 2 N-NiTiO 2 in increasing order), which may result from the impurity energy level introduced by doping different elements in the TiO 2 crystal; the band gap of the samples is calculated by extrapolating a straight line to the abscissa at zero absorption (Sanchez et al. 1995). Table 3 summarizes the results of photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 using different photocatalysts under 8 h irradiation by UV sources and visible light.Obviously, light of 14 254 nm makes the photocatalysts more active than 14 365 nm and 14 400-780 nm, because the decreasing of means the increasing energy of the photon.From Table 3, we know that the catalysts of N and Ni 2 codoped TiO 2 had better photocatalytic performance than pure TiO 2 , and N and Ni 2 doped TiO 2 , especially under the light of 14 400-780 nm increases the methanol yield.It suggests that there is a synergistic effect of N and Ni 2 on nano-TiO 2 in photocatalytic reductions of CO 2 in combination with the UV-Vis analysis (Fig. 6). During the research we found better doping amounts for the N and Ni 2 , which were 4 and 6 (based on mass of TiO 2 ) for N and Ni 2 , respectively.Fig. 7 and 8 illustrate the effect of N and Ni 2 doping amounts on methanol yield of CO 2 ). When light energy larger than the TiO 2 band gap is absorbed by the TiO 2 particles, an electron (e A ) and positive hole (h ) are formed in the catalysts and located in the conduction and valence bands, respectively Eq. ( 1) ( Kaneco et al. 1997;Linsebigler et al. 1995).e A and h can redox with the species on the surface.There are two major shortcomings of the pure nano-TiO 2 crystal, one is the lower utilization of light-it captures less than 5 of all solar radiation at the earth's surface accurately; the other is low photocatalytic efficiency, induced by the recombination of e A and h before the trapping by appropriate active sites. One of the most promising and widely investigated photocatalysts is nitrogen-doped titanium dioxide (NTiO 2 ), but there are still differences views on the doping mechanism: 1. N replaces O at regular lattice site, forming impurity energy levels that are just on the top of the valence band; 2. N is hosted in an interstitial position and directly connects with O, forming impurity energy levels that are slightly higher in the gap; and 3. N doping favors oxygen vacancy formation (Ti 3 defects), forming a defect level that is slightly lower than the conduction band (Livraghi et al. 2006;Di Valention et al. 2005;Asahi et al. 2001).Because all the impurity energy levels of N doping are in the gap (higher than the valence band energy levels and lower than the conduction band energy levels) here, an intermediate energy level (IEL) is defined for discussion.The IEL can narrow the band gap of TiO 2 (Eg 3:2 eV), so the light response of TiO 2 increases and moves to the long-wavelength region. Recent studies reported that when the mass ratio of anatase phase and rutile phase was 73 in the mix-crystal structure results in the best photocatalytic activity (Chen et al. 2002).From Fig. 1 Table 3 and Table 1, we know that N doped TiO 2 contains more rutile phase and crystallizes better than the pure TiO 2 , so the light response of NTiO 2 is enhanced compared to pure TiO 2 .This may be because its mix-crystal structure is closer to 73 than pure TiO 2 .An obvious red shift is found in UV-V is absorption spectra of NTiO 2 (Fig. 6) and indicates that N doping can narrow the band gap of nano-TiO 2 because the of the IEL.Photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 experiments show that when using light ( 14 254 nm) irradiation, the methanol yield of NTiO 2 is 14.2 times higher than that of pure TiO 2 , while light ( 14 400-780 nm) irradiation, the methanol yield of NTiO 2 is 55.1 times higher than that of pure TiO 2 (Table 3), so N doping can greatly enhance the activity of light absorption.But when the doping amount of N is excess, N species may be piled together on the crystal surface of TiO 2 , reducing the specific surface area of TiO 2 . Since the ionic radius of Ni 2 is close to Ti 4 , Ti 4 can be substituted by Ni 2 .FTIR spectra (Fig. 3) have demonstrated the replacement of Ni 2 ions in the TiO 2 matrix, and a new impurity energy level may generate for the Ni-O bond, so that the threshold of light excitation has been reduced (Yu et al. 2006;Tseng et al. 2009;Kim et al. 2006).The Ni 2 may improve the photocatalytic activity of TiO 2 because Ni 2 acts as a probable electron trapper in TiO 2 Eq.( 2), reducing the chance of electron-hole recombination and ensuring a good separation of electron-hole pairs.Subsequently Ni could be oxidized to Ni 2 by transferring electrons to the active CO 2 species, facilitating the process of photoreduction of CO 2 Eq.( 3).However with higher concentration of Ni , it can serve as a recombination center Eq.( 4), because Ni and photogenerated holes are close to each other (Kim et al. 2006), hindering the generation of electrons for reduction of CO 2 and reducing the efficiency of the photocatalysis. The results of the experiments in Table 3 show us that N-NiTiO 2 is the best candidate for the photoreduction of CO 2 with the highest methanol yield in the same condition.We think the reasons for this are as follows: 1. N and Ni 2 codoped TiO 2 have smaller particle sizes, good crystals, and large special surface areas, which are favorable to the photoreaction; 2. The band gap of TiO 2 is narrowed for N doping, meaning the better absorption of visible light; and 3.The Ni 2 in the lattice can reduce the chances of electron and hole recombination, and the electrons can be easily transferred to the species on the surface of TiO 2 .The synergistic effect of N and Ni 2 in the lattice of TiO 2 leads to the best performance of methanol yield. NaOH aqueous is indispensable, because it a acts as hole-scavenger to reduce the recombination of electron and hole, and NaOH solution also dissolves more CO 2 than the pure water.Eqs. ( 3) and ( 5) show the source of the electron for the reduction reaction.Eq. ( 6) tells us that six electrons are required to covert the C 4 of CO 2 to the C 2A of CH 3 OH.In the reaction system, the oxidation and reduction take place simultaneously, and O 2 and OH are products that can oxidize methanol, so we added Na 2 SO 3 in the system which can be oxidized instead of CH 3 OH Eq.( 7)."}, {"llm generation": "N-NiTiO2", "source": "N doped TiO 2 contains more rutile phase than the pure-TiO 2 ; no characteristic peaks appear in NiTiO 2 and N-NiTiO 2 .", "context": "The XRD of the catalysts in Fig. 1 shows that anatase is the major phase in nano-TiO 2 , which is the most active phase for photoreaction after calcinations at 500C.N doped TiO 2 contains more rutile phase than the pure-TiO 2 ; no characteristic peaks appear in NiTiO 2 and N-NiTiO 2 .This suggests that the distribution of Ni 2 is possibly continuous in the particles because the NiNO 3 2 6H 2 O was added before the hydrolysis of butyltitanate during the preparation (see \"Experimental Procedure\").The grain sizes of the catalyst are calculated from the Scherrer equation (2 14 25:14).

Since the ionic radius of Ni 2 is close to Ti 4 , Ti 4 can be substituted by Ni 2 .FTIR spectra (Fig. 3) have demonstrated the replacement of Ni 2 ions in the TiO 2 matrix, and a new impurity energy level may generate for the Ni-O bond, so that the threshold of light excitation has been reduced (Yu et al. 2006;Tseng et al. 2009;Kim et al. 2006).The Ni 2 may improve the photocatalytic activity of TiO 2 because Ni 2 acts as a probable electron trapper in TiO 2 Eq.( 2), reducing the chance of electron-hole recombination and ensuring a good separation of electron-hole pairs.Subsequently Ni could be oxidized to Ni 2 by transferring electrons to the active CO 2 species, facilitating the process of photoreduction of CO 2 Eq.( 3).However with higher concentration of Ni , it can serve as a recombination center Eq.( 4), because Ni and photogenerated holes are close to each other (Kim et al. 2006), hindering the generation of electrons for reduction of CO 2 and reducing the efficiency of the photocatalysis. The results of the experiments in Table 3 show us that N-NiTiO 2 is the best candidate for the photoreduction of CO 2 with the highest methanol yield in the same condition.We think the reasons for this are as follows: 1. N and Ni 2 codoped TiO 2 have smaller particle sizes, good crystals, and large special surface areas, which are favorable to the photoreaction; 2. The band gap of TiO 2 is narrowed for N doping, meaning the better absorption of visible light; and 3.The Ni 2 in the lattice can reduce the chances of electron and hole recombination, and the electrons can be easily transferred to the species on the surface of TiO 2 .The synergistic effect of N and Ni 2 in the lattice of TiO 2 leads to the best performance of methanol yield. NaOH aqueous is indispensable, because it a acts as hole-scavenger to reduce the recombination of electron and hole, and NaOH solution also dissolves more CO 2 than the pure water.Eqs. ( 3) and ( 5) show the source of the electron for the reduction reaction.Eq. ( 6) tells us that six electrons are required to covert the C 4 of CO 2 to the C 2A of CH 3 OH.In the reaction system, the oxidation and reduction take place simultaneously, and O 2 and OH are products that can oxidize methanol, so we added Na 2 SO 3 in the system which can be oxidized instead of CH 3 OH Eq.( 7)."}, {"llm generation": "Ni2 doped TiO2", "source": "The Ni 2 doped TiO 2 absorbed more photons than N doped TiO 2 in the wavelength between 390 and 445 nm, but the photoresponsiveness was opposite in the other regions.", "context": "The XRD of the catalysts in Fig. 1 shows that anatase is the major phase in nano-TiO 2 , which is the most active phase for photoreaction after calcinations at 500C.N doped TiO 2 contains more rutile phase than the pure-TiO 2 ; no characteristic peaks appear in NiTiO 2 and N-NiTiO 2 .This suggests that the distribution of Ni 2 is possibly continuous in the particles because the NiNO 3 2 6H 2 O was added before the hydrolysis of butyltitanate during the preparation (see \"Experimental Procedure\").The grain sizes of the catalyst are calculated from the Scherrer equation (2 14 25:14). Table 1 summarizes the properties of the catalysts, and the particle sizes are consistent with the TEM observation illustrated in Fig. 2.This suggests that Ni 2 can suppress TiO 2 from anatase phase to rutile.N and Ni 2 not only could increase specific surface area, which is favorable to the catalytic reaction in comparison with 17:60 m 2 g of nano-TiO 2 , but also could effectively inhibit phase transformation from anatase to rutile, and growth in size and aggregation of the particle.The most important finding is that the band gap of TiO 2 is reduced, which results in fine photoresponse. The particle sizes of sol-gel derived N-NiTiO 2 are uniform and the diameter is between 10-15 nm; N-NiTiO 2 have good dispersion and crystallization compared to nano-TiO 2 (Fig. 2).N and Ni 2 could suppress the aggregation of the particles.It was reported in (Yu et al. 2006;Tseng et al. 2009) that Ni 2 can substitute Ti 4 because of the ionic radius of Ni 2 is close to that of Ti 4 ; accordingly, Ni 2 could enter into the lattice preventing the crystal growth.We know the existence of the Ni-O bond from Fig. 3, however, N doping favors oxygen vacancy formation (Livraghi et al. 2006), which could stop the aggregation of the particles.The electron diffraction patterns of the samples are instructive that N-NiTiO 2 are crystallized better than pure TiO 2 . Table 2 lists the element content of N-NiTiO 2 estimated from EDS patterns of N-NiTiO 2 (Fig. 4).Ti is substituted by Ni in the crystal, so the weight percentage of Ti element in the nano-TiO 2 is lower than 60, which is determined by the chemical formula of TiO 2 .The atomic percentage of O is higher for the existence of adsorbed oxygen on the surface of nano-TiO 2 . Fig. 3 presents the FTIR spectrum of TiO 2 , NTiO 2 , NiTiO 2 , and N-NiTiO 2 before annealing.The peak centered at 657:52 cm A1 is caused by vibration absorption of the Ti-O bands.The 3;402:71 cm A1 is characteristic peak of the OH-stretching vibration of free and hydrogen-bonded surface hydroxyl groups, the 1;640:84 cm A1 is caused by the H-O-H bending vibration of the physically adsorbed water.The peak at 2;956:78 cm A1 is caused by the stretching vibration of the CH 3 -and-CH 2 -, but it disappears in the N doped TiO 2 samples, thus further investigation is needed.The peak at 1;380:50 cm A1 belongs to Ni-O vibration absorption (Ji et al. 1989), which indicates that Ti 4 can be substituted by Ni 2 before annealing. Fig. 5 displays the TG-DSC curves of N-NiTiO 2 catalyst before annealing.A primary endothermic process appears in the DSC curves before 130C, which is attributed to the desorption of the water, n-butanol, and acetic acid in the gel, leading to a weight loss of 10.A rapid weight loss occurs from 200-400C with a weight loss of 35, which is attributed to the two small exothermic peaks between 250C and 330C, because of the decomposition of organic compounds in the gel.There is almost no weight loss after 500C, because the exothermic peak before 500C caused by the phase transformation of TiO 2 from anatase to rutile.The phase transformations of TiO 2 and NTiO 2 are approximately 450 and 420C, respectively, which can explain why rutile phase in NTiO 2 is found more often than that in pure-TiO 2 , according to the XRD study (Table 1). The optical absorption spectrum for pure TiO 2 , NTiO 2 , NiTiO 2 , and N-NiTiO 2 obtained by the diffuse reflection method are shown in Fig. 6.A noticeable shift in the absorption edge into the visible light region up to 430 nm was observed for N-NiTiO 2 , which had better photoresponsiveness.The Ni 2 doped TiO 2 absorbed more photons than N doped TiO 2 in the wavelength between 390 and 445 nm, but the photoresponsiveness was opposite in the other regions.This phenomenon may be related to the mechanism of the doping, although it is not certain.The absorption edge of doped TiO 2 shifts to longer wavelength in comparison with pure-TiO 2 (generally TiO 2 NiTiO 2 NTiO 2 N-NiTiO 2 in increasing order), which may result from the impurity energy level introduced by doping different elements in the TiO 2 crystal; the band gap of the samples is calculated by extrapolating a straight line to the abscissa at zero absorption (Sanchez et al. 1995). Table 3 summarizes the results of photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 using different photocatalysts under 8 h irradiation by UV sources and visible light.Obviously, light of 14 254 nm makes the photocatalysts more active than 14 365 nm and 14 400-780 nm, because the decreasing of means the increasing energy of the photon.From Table 3, we know that the catalysts of N and Ni 2 codoped TiO 2 had better photocatalytic performance than pure TiO 2 , and N and Ni 2 doped TiO 2 , especially under the light of 14 400-780 nm increases the methanol yield.It suggests that there is a synergistic effect of N and Ni 2 on nano-TiO 2 in photocatalytic reductions of CO 2 in combination with the UV-Vis analysis (Fig. 6). During the research we found better doping amounts for the N and Ni 2 , which were 4 and 6 (based on mass of TiO 2 ) for N and Ni 2 , respectively.Fig. 7 and 8 illustrate the effect of N and Ni 2 doping amounts on methanol yield of CO 2 ). When light energy larger than the TiO 2 band gap is absorbed by the TiO 2 particles, an electron (e A ) and positive hole (h ) are formed in the catalysts and located in the conduction and valence bands, respectively Eq. ( 1) ( Kaneco et al. 1997;Linsebigler et al. 1995).e A and h can redox with the species on the surface.There are two major shortcomings of the pure nano-TiO 2 crystal, one is the lower utilization of light-it captures less than 5 of all solar radiation at the earth's surface accurately; the other is low photocatalytic efficiency, induced by the recombination of e A and h before the trapping by appropriate active sites. One of the most promising and widely investigated photocatalysts is nitrogen-doped titanium dioxide (NTiO 2 ), but there are still differences views on the doping mechanism: 1. N replaces O at regular lattice site, forming impurity energy levels that are just on the top of the valence band; 2. N is hosted in an interstitial position and directly connects with O, forming impurity energy levels that are slightly higher in the gap; and 3. N doping favors oxygen vacancy formation (Ti 3 defects), forming a defect level that is slightly lower than the conduction band (Livraghi et al. 2006;Di Valention et al. 2005;Asahi et al. 2001).Because all the impurity energy levels of N doping are in the gap (higher than the valence band energy levels and lower than the conduction band energy levels) here, an intermediate energy level (IEL) is defined for discussion.The IEL can narrow the band gap of TiO 2 (Eg 3:2 eV), so the light response of TiO 2 increases and moves to the long-wavelength region.

( 6) tells us that six electrons are required to covert the C 4 of CO 2 to the C 2A of CH 3 OH.In the reaction system, the oxidation and reduction take place simultaneously, and O 2 and OH are products that can oxidize methanol, so we added Na 2 SO 3 in the system which can be oxidized instead of CH 3 OH Eq.( 7)."}, {"llm generation": "Na 2 SO 3", "source": "Under optimal reduction conditions, a reaction time of 8 h, a CO 2 flow rate of 200 mL min, a N-NiTiO 2 concentration of 1 gL, a reaction temperature of 75C, C NaOH 14 0:20 molL, C Na 2 SO 3 14 0:20 molL, and a 14 254 nm (15 W), the yield of methanol could reach 482:0 molg-cat, which was far more than that of nano-TiO 2 without doping (17:3 molg-cat).", "context": "N and Ni 2 codoped nanotitania (N-NiTiO 2 ) for production of methanol by photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 were prepared by an improved sol-gel method.N and Ni 2 not only could increase specific surface area of N-NiTiO 2 , but also could effectively inhibit phase transformation from anatase phase to rutile, growth in size and aggregation of the particle.It demonstrated better properties than pure nanotitania, N doped titania and Ni 2 doped titania, considering their performance of photoresponse and photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .We believe that the synergistic effect of N and Ni 2 on nano-TiO 2 resulted in improvement in the methanol yield under the 14 400-780 nm at the same condition.Under optimal reduction conditions, a reaction time of 8 h, a CO 2 flow rate of 200 mL min, a N-NiTiO 2 concentration of 1 gL, a reaction temperature of 75C, C NaOH 14 0:20 molL, C Na 2 SO 3 14 0:20 molL, and a 14 254 nm (15 W), the yield of methanol could reach 482:0 molg-cat, which was far more than that of nano-TiO 2 without doping (17:3 molg-cat).More studies are necessary to improve the efficiency of the photocatalysts in this field of photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .

The hydrolyzing water was homogeneously and slowly released by the esterification of n-butanol and acetic acid, at the same time acetic acid served as a chelating ligand and modified the titanium butoxide at molecular level, which deceased the rate of hydrolysis, to say, fine photocatalysts (Wu et al. 2001).Pure nano-TiO 2 was prepared by the same way without urea and nickel nitrate adding, NTiO 2 and NiTiO 2 without nickel nitrate and urea adding respectively. The photocatalytic reaction system was illuminated by a 15 W UV lamp (254 nm or 365 nm) or an incandescent lamp (400-780 nm) in the center, and it was shielded by a black box during the reaction to prevent interference from outside light and protect us from the UV.The catalyst was suspended in 400 ml of 0:2 molL NaOH and 0:2 molL Na 2 SO 3 aqueous solution.Ultrapure CO 2 was bubbled through the reactor for at least 30 mins to eliminate the dissolved oxygen and saturate the solution.The catalystsuspended solution was agitated by a magnetic stirrer.The temperature was monitored continuously by thermocouple.A needle-type probe was inserted into the reactor to withdraw a small liquid sample, and after the catalyst powder were filtered, the liquid sample was analyzed using gas chromatography.Analysis indicated that methanol was the major hydrocarbon.Blank reactions were also conducted, one without catalyst, and one without illumination; no hydrocarbon was detected in the blank tests."}, {"llm generation": "UV sources", "source": "Table 3 summarizes the results of photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 using different photocatalysts under 8 h irradiation by UV sources and visible light.", "context": "The XRD of the catalysts in Fig. 1 shows that anatase is the major phase in nano-TiO 2 , which is the most active phase for photoreaction after calcinations at 500C.N doped TiO 2 contains more rutile phase than the pure-TiO 2 ; no characteristic peaks appear in NiTiO 2 and N-NiTiO 2 .This suggests that the distribution of Ni 2 is possibly continuous in the particles because the NiNO 3 2 6H 2 O was added before the hydrolysis of butyltitanate during the preparation (see \"Experimental Procedure\").The grain sizes of the catalyst are calculated from the Scherrer equation (2 14 25:14). Table 1 summarizes the properties of the catalysts, and the particle sizes are consistent with the TEM observation illustrated in Fig. 2.This suggests that Ni 2 can suppress TiO 2 from anatase phase to rutile.N and Ni 2 not only could increase specific surface area, which is favorable to the catalytic reaction in comparison with 17:60 m 2 g of nano-TiO 2 , but also could effectively inhibit phase transformation from anatase to rutile, and growth in size and aggregation of the particle.The most important finding is that the band gap of TiO 2 is reduced, which results in fine photoresponse. The particle sizes of sol-gel derived N-NiTiO 2 are uniform and the diameter is between 10-15 nm; N-NiTiO 2 have good dispersion and crystallization compared to nano-TiO 2 (Fig. 2).N and Ni 2 could suppress the aggregation of the particles.It was reported in (Yu et al. 2006;Tseng et al. 2009) that Ni 2 can substitute Ti 4 because of the ionic radius of Ni 2 is close to that of Ti 4 ; accordingly, Ni 2 could enter into the lattice preventing the crystal growth.We know the existence of the Ni-O bond from Fig. 3, however, N doping favors oxygen vacancy formation (Livraghi et al. 2006), which could stop the aggregation of the particles.The electron diffraction patterns of the samples are instructive that N-NiTiO 2 are crystallized better than pure TiO 2 . Table 2 lists the element content of N-NiTiO 2 estimated from EDS patterns of N-NiTiO 2 (Fig. 4).Ti is substituted by Ni in the crystal, so the weight percentage of Ti element in the nano-TiO 2 is lower than 60, which is determined by the chemical formula of TiO 2 .The atomic percentage of O is higher for the existence of adsorbed oxygen on the surface of nano-TiO 2 . Fig. 3 presents the FTIR spectrum of TiO 2 , NTiO 2 , NiTiO 2 , and N-NiTiO 2 before annealing.The peak centered at 657:52 cm A1 is caused by vibration absorption of the Ti-O bands.The 3;402:71 cm A1 is characteristic peak of the OH-stretching vibration of free and hydrogen-bonded surface hydroxyl groups, the 1;640:84 cm A1 is caused by the H-O-H bending vibration of the physically adsorbed water.The peak at 2;956:78 cm A1 is caused by the stretching vibration of the CH 3 -and-CH 2 -, but it disappears in the N doped TiO 2 samples, thus further investigation is needed.The peak at 1;380:50 cm A1 belongs to Ni-O vibration absorption (Ji et al. 1989), which indicates that Ti 4 can be substituted by Ni 2 before annealing. Fig. 5 displays the TG-DSC curves of N-NiTiO 2 catalyst before annealing.A primary endothermic process appears in the DSC curves before 130C, which is attributed to the desorption of the water, n-butanol, and acetic acid in the gel, leading to a weight loss of 10.A rapid weight loss occurs from 200-400C with a weight loss of 35, which is attributed to the two small exothermic peaks between 250C and 330C, because of the decomposition of organic compounds in the gel.There is almost no weight loss after 500C, because the exothermic peak before 500C caused by the phase transformation of TiO 2 from anatase to rutile.The phase transformations of TiO 2 and NTiO 2 are approximately 450 and 420C, respectively, which can explain why rutile phase in NTiO 2 is found more often than that in pure-TiO 2 , according to the XRD study (Table 1). The optical absorption spectrum for pure TiO 2 , NTiO 2 , NiTiO 2 , and N-NiTiO 2 obtained by the diffuse reflection method are shown in Fig. 6.A noticeable shift in the absorption edge into the visible light region up to 430 nm was observed for N-NiTiO 2 , which had better photoresponsiveness.The Ni 2 doped TiO 2 absorbed more photons than N doped TiO 2 in the wavelength between 390 and 445 nm, but the photoresponsiveness was opposite in the other regions.This phenomenon may be related to the mechanism of the doping, although it is not certain.The absorption edge of doped TiO 2 shifts to longer wavelength in comparison with pure-TiO 2 (generally TiO 2 NiTiO 2 NTiO 2 N-NiTiO 2 in increasing order), which may result from the impurity energy level introduced by doping different elements in the TiO 2 crystal; the band gap of the samples is calculated by extrapolating a straight line to the abscissa at zero absorption (Sanchez et al. 1995). Table 3 summarizes the results of photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 using different photocatalysts under 8 h irradiation by UV sources and visible light.Obviously, light of 14 254 nm makes the photocatalysts more active than 14 365 nm and 14 400-780 nm, because the decreasing of means the increasing energy of the photon.From Table 3, we know that the catalysts of N and Ni 2 codoped TiO 2 had better photocatalytic performance than pure TiO 2 , and N and Ni 2 doped TiO 2 , especially under the light of 14 400-780 nm increases the methanol yield.It suggests that there is a synergistic effect of N and Ni 2 on nano-TiO 2 in photocatalytic reductions of CO 2 in combination with the UV-Vis analysis (Fig. 6). During the research we found better doping amounts for the N and Ni 2 , which were 4 and 6 (based on mass of TiO 2 ) for N and Ni 2 , respectively.Fig. 7 and 8 illustrate the effect of N and Ni 2 doping amounts on methanol yield of CO 2 ). When light energy larger than the TiO 2 band gap is absorbed by the TiO 2 particles, an electron (e A ) and positive hole (h ) are formed in the catalysts and located in the conduction and valence bands, respectively Eq. ( 1) ( Kaneco et al. 1997;Linsebigler et al. 1995).e A and h can redox with the species on the surface.There are two major shortcomings of the pure nano-TiO 2 crystal, one is the lower utilization of light-it captures less than 5 of all solar radiation at the earth's surface accurately; the other is low photocatalytic efficiency, induced by the recombination of e A and h before the trapping by appropriate active sites. One of the most promising and widely investigated photocatalysts is nitrogen-doped titanium dioxide (NTiO 2 ), but there are still differences views on the doping mechanism: 1. N replaces O at regular lattice site, forming impurity energy levels that are just on the top of the valence band; 2. N is hosted in an interstitial position and directly connects with O, forming impurity energy levels that are slightly higher in the gap; and 3. N doping favors oxygen vacancy formation (Ti 3 defects), forming a defect level that is slightly lower than the conduction band (Livraghi et al. 2006;Di Valention et al. 2005;Asahi et al. 2001).Because all the impurity energy levels of N doping are in the gap (higher than the valence band energy levels and lower than the conduction band energy levels) here, an intermediate energy level (IEL) is defined for discussion.The IEL can narrow the band gap of TiO 2 (Eg 3:2 eV), so the light response of TiO 2 increases and moves to the long-wavelength region. Recent studies reported that when the mass ratio of anatase phase and rutile phase was 73 in the mix-crystal structure results in the best photocatalytic activity (Chen et al. 2002).From Fig. 1 Table 3 and Table 1, we know that N doped TiO 2 contains more rutile phase and crystallizes better than the pure TiO 2 , so the light response of NTiO 2 is enhanced compared to pure TiO 2 .This may be because its mix-crystal structure is closer to 73 than pure TiO 2 .An obvious red shift is found in UV-V is absorption spectra of NTiO 2 (Fig. 6) and indicates that N doping can narrow the band gap of nano-TiO 2 because the of the IEL.Photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 experiments show that when using light ( 14 254 nm) irradiation, the methanol yield of NTiO 2 is 14.2 times higher than that of pure TiO 2 , while light ( 14 400-780 nm) irradiation, the methanol yield of NTiO 2 is 55.1 times higher than that of pure TiO 2 (Table 3), so N doping can greatly enhance the activity of light absorption.But when the doping amount of N is excess, N species may be piled together on the crystal surface of TiO 2 , reducing the specific surface area of TiO 2 . Since the ionic radius of Ni 2 is close to Ti 4 , Ti 4 can be substituted by Ni 2 .FTIR spectra (Fig. 3) have demonstrated the replacement of Ni 2 ions in the TiO 2 matrix, and a new impurity energy level may generate for the Ni-O bond, so that the threshold of light excitation has been reduced (Yu et al. 2006;Tseng et al. 2009;Kim et al. 2006).The Ni 2 may improve the photocatalytic activity of TiO 2 because Ni 2 acts as a probable electron trapper in TiO 2 Eq.( 2), reducing the chance of electron-hole recombination and ensuring a good separation of electron-hole pairs.Subsequently Ni could be oxidized to Ni 2 by transferring electrons to the active CO 2 species, facilitating the process of photoreduction of CO 2 Eq.( 3).However with higher concentration of Ni , it can serve as a recombination center Eq.( 4), because Ni and photogenerated holes are close to each other (Kim et al. 2006), hindering the generation of electrons for reduction of CO 2 and reducing the efficiency of the photocatalysis. The results of the experiments in Table 3 show us that N-NiTiO 2 is the best candidate for the photoreduction of CO 2 with the highest methanol yield in the same condition.We think the reasons for this are as follows: 1. N and Ni 2 codoped TiO 2 have smaller particle sizes, good crystals, and large special surface areas, which are favorable to the photoreaction; 2. The band gap of TiO 2 is narrowed for N doping, meaning the better absorption of visible light; and 3.The Ni 2 in the lattice can reduce the chances of electron and hole recombination, and the electrons can be easily transferred to the species on the surface of TiO 2 .The synergistic effect of N and Ni 2 in the lattice of TiO 2 leads to the best performance of methanol yield.

Table 2 lists the element content of N-NiTiO 2 estimated from EDS patterns of N-NiTiO 2 (Fig. 4).Ti is substituted by Ni in the crystal, so the weight percentage of Ti element in the nano-TiO 2 is lower than 60, which is determined by the chemical formula of TiO 2 .The atomic percentage of O is higher for the existence of adsorbed oxygen on the surface of nano-TiO 2 . Fig. 3 presents the FTIR spectrum of TiO 2 , NTiO 2 , NiTiO 2 , and N-NiTiO 2 before annealing.The peak centered at 657:52 cm A1 is caused by vibration absorption of the Ti-O bands.The 3;402:71 cm A1 is characteristic peak of the OH-stretching vibration of free and hydrogen-bonded surface hydroxyl groups, the 1;640:84 cm A1 is caused by the H-O-H bending vibration of the physically adsorbed water.The peak at 2;956:78 cm A1 is caused by the stretching vibration of the CH 3 -and-CH 2 -, but it disappears in the N doped TiO 2 samples, thus further investigation is needed.The peak at 1;380:50 cm A1 belongs to Ni-O vibration absorption (Ji et al. 1989), which indicates that Ti 4 can be substituted by Ni 2 before annealing. Fig. 5 displays the TG-DSC curves of N-NiTiO 2 catalyst before annealing.A primary endothermic process appears in the DSC curves before 130C, which is attributed to the desorption of the water, n-butanol, and acetic acid in the gel, leading to a weight loss of 10.A rapid weight loss occurs from 200-400C with a weight loss of 35, which is attributed to the two small exothermic peaks between 250C and 330C, because of the decomposition of organic compounds in the gel.There is almost no weight loss after 500C, because the exothermic peak before 500C caused by the phase transformation of TiO 2 from anatase to rutile.The phase transformations of TiO 2 and NTiO 2 are approximately 450 and 420C, respectively, which can explain why rutile phase in NTiO 2 is found more often than that in pure-TiO 2 , according to the XRD study (Table 1). The optical absorption spectrum for pure TiO 2 , NTiO 2 , NiTiO 2 , and N-NiTiO 2 obtained by the diffuse reflection method are shown in Fig. 6.A noticeable shift in the absorption edge into the visible light region up to 430 nm was observed for N-NiTiO 2 , which had better photoresponsiveness.The Ni 2 doped TiO 2 absorbed more photons than N doped TiO 2 in the wavelength between 390 and 445 nm, but the photoresponsiveness was opposite in the other regions.This phenomenon may be related to the mechanism of the doping, although it is not certain.The absorption edge of doped TiO 2 shifts to longer wavelength in comparison with pure-TiO 2 (generally TiO 2 NiTiO 2 NTiO 2 N-NiTiO 2 in increasing order), which may result from the impurity energy level introduced by doping different elements in the TiO 2 crystal; the band gap of the samples is calculated by extrapolating a straight line to the abscissa at zero absorption (Sanchez et al. 1995). Table 3 summarizes the results of photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 using different photocatalysts under 8 h irradiation by UV sources and visible light.Obviously, light of 14 254 nm makes the photocatalysts more active than 14 365 nm and 14 400-780 nm, because the decreasing of means the increasing energy of the photon.From Table 3, we know that the catalysts of N and Ni 2 codoped TiO 2 had better photocatalytic performance than pure TiO 2 , and N and Ni 2 doped TiO 2 , especially under the light of 14 400-780 nm increases the methanol yield.It suggests that there is a synergistic effect of N and Ni 2 on nano-TiO 2 in photocatalytic reductions of CO 2 in combination with the UV-Vis analysis (Fig. 6). During the research we found better doping amounts for the N and Ni 2 , which were 4 and 6 (based on mass of TiO 2 ) for N and Ni 2 , respectively.Fig. 7 and 8 illustrate the effect of N and Ni 2 doping amounts on methanol yield of CO 2 ). When light energy larger than the TiO 2 band gap is absorbed by the TiO 2 particles, an electron (e A ) and positive hole (h ) are formed in the catalysts and located in the conduction and valence bands, respectively Eq. ( 1) ( Kaneco et al. 1997;Linsebigler et al. 1995).e A and h can redox with the species on the surface.There are two major shortcomings of the pure nano-TiO 2 crystal, one is the lower utilization of light-it captures less than 5 of all solar radiation at the earth's surface accurately; the other is low photocatalytic efficiency, induced by the recombination of e A and h before the trapping by appropriate active sites. One of the most promising and widely investigated photocatalysts is nitrogen-doped titanium dioxide (NTiO 2 ), but there are still differences views on the doping mechanism: 1. N replaces O at regular lattice site, forming impurity energy levels that are just on the top of the valence band; 2. N is hosted in an interstitial position and directly connects with O, forming impurity energy levels that are slightly higher in the gap; and 3. N doping favors oxygen vacancy formation (Ti 3 defects), forming a defect level that is slightly lower than the conduction band (Livraghi et al. 2006;Di Valention et al. 2005;Asahi et al. 2001).Because all the impurity energy levels of N doping are in the gap (higher than the valence band energy levels and lower than the conduction band energy levels) here, an intermediate energy level (IEL) is defined for discussion.The IEL can narrow the band gap of TiO 2 (Eg 3:2 eV), so the light response of TiO 2 increases and moves to the long-wavelength region. Recent studies reported that when the mass ratio of anatase phase and rutile phase was 73 in the mix-crystal structure results in the best photocatalytic activity (Chen et al. 2002).From Fig. 1 Table 3 and Table 1, we know that N doped TiO 2 contains more rutile phase and crystallizes better than the pure TiO 2 , so the light response of NTiO 2 is enhanced compared to pure TiO 2 .This may be because its mix-crystal structure is closer to 73 than pure TiO 2 .An obvious red shift is found in UV-V is absorption spectra of NTiO 2 (Fig. 6) and indicates that N doping can narrow the band gap of nano-TiO 2 because the of the IEL.Photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 experiments show that when using light ( 14 254 nm) irradiation, the methanol yield of NTiO 2 is 14.2 times higher than that of pure TiO 2 , while light ( 14 400-780 nm) irradiation, the methanol yield of NTiO 2 is 55.1 times higher than that of pure TiO 2 (Table 3), so N doping can greatly enhance the activity of light absorption.But when the doping amount of N is excess, N species may be piled together on the crystal surface of TiO 2 , reducing the specific surface area of TiO 2 . Since the ionic radius of Ni 2 is close to Ti 4 , Ti 4 can be substituted by Ni 2 .FTIR spectra (Fig. 3) have demonstrated the replacement of Ni 2 ions in the TiO 2 matrix, and a new impurity energy level may generate for the Ni-O bond, so that the threshold of light excitation has been reduced (Yu et al. 2006;Tseng et al. 2009;Kim et al. 2006).The Ni 2 may improve the photocatalytic activity of TiO 2 because Ni 2 acts as a probable electron trapper in TiO 2 Eq.( 2), reducing the chance of electron-hole recombination and ensuring a good separation of electron-hole pairs.Subsequently Ni could be oxidized to Ni 2 by transferring electrons to the active CO 2 species, facilitating the process of photoreduction of CO 2 Eq.( 3).However with higher concentration of Ni , it can serve as a recombination center Eq.( 4), because Ni and photogenerated holes are close to each other (Kim et al. 2006), hindering the generation of electrons for reduction of CO 2 and reducing the efficiency of the photocatalysis. The results of the experiments in Table 3 show us that N-NiTiO 2 is the best candidate for the photoreduction of CO 2 with the highest methanol yield in the same condition.We think the reasons for this are as follows: 1. N and Ni 2 codoped TiO 2 have smaller particle sizes, good crystals, and large special surface areas, which are favorable to the photoreaction; 2. The band gap of TiO 2 is narrowed for N doping, meaning the better absorption of visible light; and 3.The Ni 2 in the lattice can reduce the chances of electron and hole recombination, and the electrons can be easily transferred to the species on the surface of TiO 2 .The synergistic effect of N and Ni 2 in the lattice of TiO 2 leads to the best performance of methanol yield. NaOH aqueous is indispensable, because it a acts as hole-scavenger to reduce the recombination of electron and hole, and NaOH solution also dissolves more CO 2 than the pure water.Eqs. ( 3) and ( 5) show the source of the electron for the reduction reaction.Eq. ( 6) tells us that six electrons are required to covert the C 4 of CO 2 to the C 2A of CH 3 OH.In the reaction system, the oxidation and reduction take place simultaneously, and O 2 and OH are products that can oxidize methanol, so we added Na 2 SO 3 in the system which can be oxidized instead of CH 3 OH Eq.( 7)."}, {"llm generation": "14 400-780 nm", "source": "Obviously, light of 14 254 nm makes the photocatalysts more active than 14 365 nm and 14 400-780 nm, because the decreasing of means the increasing energy of the photon.", "context": "The XRD of the catalysts in Fig. 1 shows that anatase is the major phase in nano-TiO 2 , which is the most active phase for photoreaction after calcinations at 500C.N doped TiO 2 contains more rutile phase than the pure-TiO 2 ; no characteristic peaks appear in NiTiO 2 and N-NiTiO 2 .This suggests that the distribution of Ni 2 is possibly continuous in the particles because the NiNO 3 2 6H 2 O was added before the hydrolysis of butyltitanate during the preparation (see \"Experimental Procedure\").The grain sizes of the catalyst are calculated from the Scherrer equation (2 14 25:14).

Since the ionic radius of Ni 2 is close to Ti 4 , Ti 4 can be substituted by Ni 2 .FTIR spectra (Fig. 3) have demonstrated the replacement of Ni 2 ions in the TiO 2 matrix, and a new impurity energy level may generate for the Ni-O bond, so that the threshold of light excitation has been reduced (Yu et al. 2006;Tseng et al. 2009;Kim et al. 2006).The Ni 2 may improve the photocatalytic activity of TiO 2 because Ni 2 acts as a probable electron trapper in TiO 2 Eq.( 2), reducing the chance of electron-hole recombination and ensuring a good separation of electron-hole pairs.Subsequently Ni could be oxidized to Ni 2 by transferring electrons to the active CO 2 species, facilitating the process of photoreduction of CO 2 Eq.( 3).However with higher concentration of Ni , it can serve as a recombination center Eq.( 4), because Ni and photogenerated holes are close to each other (Kim et al. 2006), hindering the generation of electrons for reduction of CO 2 and reducing the efficiency of the photocatalysis. The results of the experiments in Table 3 show us that N-NiTiO 2 is the best candidate for the photoreduction of CO 2 with the highest methanol yield in the same condition.We think the reasons for this are as follows: 1. N and Ni 2 codoped TiO 2 have smaller particle sizes, good crystals, and large special surface areas, which are favorable to the photoreaction; 2. The band gap of TiO 2 is narrowed for N doping, meaning the better absorption of visible light; and 3.The Ni 2 in the lattice can reduce the chances of electron and hole recombination, and the electrons can be easily transferred to the species on the surface of TiO 2 .The synergistic effect of N and Ni 2 in the lattice of TiO 2 leads to the best performance of methanol yield. NaOH aqueous is indispensable, because it a acts as hole-scavenger to reduce the recombination of electron and hole, and NaOH solution also dissolves more CO 2 than the pure water.Eqs. ( 3) and ( 5) show the source of the electron for the reduction reaction.Eq. ( 6) tells us that six electrons are required to covert the C 4 of CO 2 to the C 2A of CH 3 OH.In the reaction system, the oxidation and reduction take place simultaneously, and O 2 and OH are products that can oxidize methanol, so we added Na 2 SO 3 in the system which can be oxidized instead of CH 3 OH Eq.( 7)."}, {"llm generation": "14 254 nm", "source": "Under optimal reduction conditions, a reaction time of 8 h, a CO 2 flow rate of 200 mL min, a N-NiTiO 2 concentration of 1 gL, a reaction temperature of 75C, C NaOH 14 0:20 molL, C Na 2 SO 3 14 0:20 molL, and a 14 254 nm (15 W), the yield of methanol could reach 482:0 molg-cat, which was far more than that of nano-TiO 2 without doping (17:3 molg-cat).", "context": "N and Ni 2 codoped nanotitania (N-NiTiO 2 ) for production of methanol by photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 were prepared by an improved sol-gel method.N and Ni 2 not only could increase specific surface area of N-NiTiO 2 , but also could effectively inhibit phase transformation from anatase phase to rutile, growth in size and aggregation of the particle.It demonstrated better properties than pure nanotitania, N doped titania and Ni 2 doped titania, considering their performance of photoresponse and photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .We believe that the synergistic effect of N and Ni 2 on nano-TiO 2 resulted in improvement in the methanol yield under the 14 400-780 nm at the same condition.Under optimal reduction conditions, a reaction time of 8 h, a CO 2 flow rate of 200 mL min, a N-NiTiO 2 concentration of 1 gL, a reaction temperature of 75C, C NaOH 14 0:20 molL, C Na 2 SO 3 14 0:20 molL, and a 14 254 nm (15 W), the yield of methanol could reach 482:0 molg-cat, which was far more than that of nano-TiO 2 without doping (17:3 molg-cat).More studies are necessary to improve the efficiency of the photocatalysts in this field of photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .

The hydrolyzing water was homogeneously and slowly released by the esterification of n-butanol and acetic acid, at the same time acetic acid served as a chelating ligand and modified the titanium butoxide at molecular level, which deceased the rate of hydrolysis, to say, fine photocatalysts (Wu et al. 2001).Pure nano-TiO 2 was prepared by the same way without urea and nickel nitrate adding, NTiO 2 and NiTiO 2 without nickel nitrate and urea adding respectively. The photocatalytic reaction system was illuminated by a 15 W UV lamp (254 nm or 365 nm) or an incandescent lamp (400-780 nm) in the center, and it was shielded by a black box during the reaction to prevent interference from outside light and protect us from the UV.The catalyst was suspended in 400 ml of 0:2 molL NaOH and 0:2 molL Na 2 SO 3 aqueous solution.Ultrapure CO 2 was bubbled through the reactor for at least 30 mins to eliminate the dissolved oxygen and saturate the solution.The catalystsuspended solution was agitated by a magnetic stirrer.The temperature was monitored continuously by thermocouple.A needle-type probe was inserted into the reactor to withdraw a small liquid sample, and after the catalyst powder were filtered, the liquid sample was analyzed using gas chromatography.Analysis indicated that methanol was the major hydrocarbon.Blank reactions were also conducted, one without catalyst, and one without illumination; no hydrocarbon was detected in the blank tests."}, {"llm generation": "Liquid", "source": "NaOH aqueous is indispensable, because it a acts as hole-scavenger to reduce the recombination of electron and hole, and NaOH solution also dissolves more CO 2 than the pure water.", "context": "The XRD of the catalysts in Fig. 1 shows that anatase is the major phase in nano-TiO 2 , which is the most active phase for photoreaction after calcinations at 500C.N doped TiO 2 contains more rutile phase than the pure-TiO 2 ; no characteristic peaks appear in NiTiO 2 and N-NiTiO 2 .This suggests that the distribution of Ni 2 is possibly continuous in the particles because the NiNO 3 2 6H 2 O was added before the hydrolysis of butyltitanate during the preparation (see \"Experimental Procedure\").The grain sizes of the catalyst are calculated from the Scherrer equation (2 14 25:14). Table 1 summarizes the properties of the catalysts, and the particle sizes are consistent with the TEM observation illustrated in Fig. 2.This suggests that Ni 2 can suppress TiO 2 from anatase phase to rutile.N and Ni 2 not only could increase specific surface area, which is favorable to the catalytic reaction in comparison with 17:60 m 2 g of nano-TiO 2 , but also could effectively inhibit phase transformation from anatase to rutile, and growth in size and aggregation of the particle.The most important finding is that the band gap of TiO 2 is reduced, which results in fine photoresponse. The particle sizes of sol-gel derived N-NiTiO 2 are uniform and the diameter is between 10-15 nm; N-NiTiO 2 have good dispersion and crystallization compared to nano-TiO 2 (Fig. 2).N and Ni 2 could suppress the aggregation of the particles.It was reported in (Yu et al. 2006;Tseng et al. 2009) that Ni 2 can substitute Ti 4 because of the ionic radius of Ni 2 is close to that of Ti 4 ; accordingly, Ni 2 could enter into the lattice preventing the crystal growth.We know the existence of the Ni-O bond from Fig. 3, however, N doping favors oxygen vacancy formation (Livraghi et al. 2006), which could stop the aggregation of the particles.The electron diffraction patterns of the samples are instructive that N-NiTiO 2 are crystallized better than pure TiO 2 . Table 2 lists the element content of N-NiTiO 2 estimated from EDS patterns of N-NiTiO 2 (Fig. 4).Ti is substituted by Ni in the crystal, so the weight percentage of Ti element in the nano-TiO 2 is lower than 60, which is determined by the chemical formula of TiO 2 .The atomic percentage of O is higher for the existence of adsorbed oxygen on the surface of nano-TiO 2 . Fig. 3 presents the FTIR spectrum of TiO 2 , NTiO 2 , NiTiO 2 , and N-NiTiO 2 before annealing.The peak centered at 657:52 cm A1 is caused by vibration absorption of the Ti-O bands.The 3;402:71 cm A1 is characteristic peak of the OH-stretching vibration of free and hydrogen-bonded surface hydroxyl groups, the 1;640:84 cm A1 is caused by the H-O-H bending vibration of the physically adsorbed water.The peak at 2;956:78 cm A1 is caused by the stretching vibration of the CH 3 -and-CH 2 -, but it disappears in the N doped TiO 2 samples, thus further investigation is needed.The peak at 1;380:50 cm A1 belongs to Ni-O vibration absorption (Ji et al. 1989), which indicates that Ti 4 can be substituted by Ni 2 before annealing. Fig. 5 displays the TG-DSC curves of N-NiTiO 2 catalyst before annealing.A primary endothermic process appears in the DSC curves before 130C, which is attributed to the desorption of the water, n-butanol, and acetic acid in the gel, leading to a weight loss of 10.A rapid weight loss occurs from 200-400C with a weight loss of 35, which is attributed to the two small exothermic peaks between 250C and 330C, because of the decomposition of organic compounds in the gel.There is almost no weight loss after 500C, because the exothermic peak before 500C caused by the phase transformation of TiO 2 from anatase to rutile.The phase transformations of TiO 2 and NTiO 2 are approximately 450 and 420C, respectively, which can explain why rutile phase in NTiO 2 is found more often than that in pure-TiO 2 , according to the XRD study (Table 1). The optical absorption spectrum for pure TiO 2 , NTiO 2 , NiTiO 2 , and N-NiTiO 2 obtained by the diffuse reflection method are shown in Fig. 6.A noticeable shift in the absorption edge into the visible light region up to 430 nm was observed for N-NiTiO 2 , which had better photoresponsiveness.The Ni 2 doped TiO 2 absorbed more photons than N doped TiO 2 in the wavelength between 390 and 445 nm, but the photoresponsiveness was opposite in the other regions.This phenomenon may be related to the mechanism of the doping, although it is not certain.The absorption edge of doped TiO 2 shifts to longer wavelength in comparison with pure-TiO 2 (generally TiO 2 NiTiO 2 NTiO 2 N-NiTiO 2 in increasing order), which may result from the impurity energy level introduced by doping different elements in the TiO 2 crystal; the band gap of the samples is calculated by extrapolating a straight line to the abscissa at zero absorption (Sanchez et al. 1995). Table 3 summarizes the results of photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 using different photocatalysts under 8 h irradiation by UV sources and visible light.Obviously, light of 14 254 nm makes the photocatalysts more active than 14 365 nm and 14 400-780 nm, because the decreasing of means the increasing energy of the photon.From Table 3, we know that the catalysts of N and Ni 2 codoped TiO 2 had better photocatalytic performance than pure TiO 2 , and N and Ni 2 doped TiO 2 , especially under the light of 14 400-780 nm increases the methanol yield.It suggests that there is a synergistic effect of N and Ni 2 on nano-TiO 2 in photocatalytic reductions of CO 2 in combination with the UV-Vis analysis (Fig. 6). During the research we found better doping amounts for the N and Ni 2 , which were 4 and 6 (based on mass of TiO 2 ) for N and Ni 2 , respectively.Fig. 7 and 8 illustrate the effect of N and Ni 2 doping amounts on methanol yield of CO 2 ). When light energy larger than the TiO 2 band gap is absorbed by the TiO 2 particles, an electron (e A ) and positive hole (h ) are formed in the catalysts and located in the conduction and valence bands, respectively Eq. ( 1) ( Kaneco et al. 1997;Linsebigler et al. 1995).e A and h can redox with the species on the surface.There are two major shortcomings of the pure nano-TiO 2 crystal, one is the lower utilization of light-it captures less than 5 of all solar radiation at the earth's surface accurately; the other is low photocatalytic efficiency, induced by the recombination of e A and h before the trapping by appropriate active sites. One of the most promising and widely investigated photocatalysts is nitrogen-doped titanium dioxide (NTiO 2 ), but there are still differences views on the doping mechanism: 1. N replaces O at regular lattice site, forming impurity energy levels that are just on the top of the valence band; 2. N is hosted in an interstitial position and directly connects with O, forming impurity energy levels that are slightly higher in the gap; and 3. N doping favors oxygen vacancy formation (Ti 3 defects), forming a defect level that is slightly lower than the conduction band (Livraghi et al. 2006;Di Valention et al. 2005;Asahi et al. 2001).Because all the impurity energy levels of N doping are in the gap (higher than the valence band energy levels and lower than the conduction band energy levels) here, an intermediate energy level (IEL) is defined for discussion.The IEL can narrow the band gap of TiO 2 (Eg 3:2 eV), so the light response of TiO 2 increases and moves to the long-wavelength region.

Since the ionic radius of Ni 2 is close to Ti 4 , Ti 4 can be substituted by Ni 2 .FTIR spectra (Fig. 3) have demonstrated the replacement of Ni 2 ions in the TiO 2 matrix, and a new impurity energy level may generate for the Ni-O bond, so that the threshold of light excitation has been reduced (Yu et al. 2006;Tseng et al. 2009;Kim et al. 2006).The Ni 2 may improve the photocatalytic activity of TiO 2 because Ni 2 acts as a probable electron trapper in TiO 2 Eq.( 2), reducing the chance of electron-hole recombination and ensuring a good separation of electron-hole pairs.Subsequently Ni could be oxidized to Ni 2 by transferring electrons to the active CO 2 species, facilitating the process of photoreduction of CO 2 Eq.( 3).However with higher concentration of Ni , it can serve as a recombination center Eq.( 4), because Ni and photogenerated holes are close to each other (Kim et al. 2006), hindering the generation of electrons for reduction of CO 2 and reducing the efficiency of the photocatalysis.
