SEM was used to obtain the morphology of the materials during the sulfuration process (Figure S1).The NH 2 -MIL-68(In) hexagonal prisms obtained here afforded an average length of 9-10 m and a diameter of 660 nm.Notably, the well-preserved overall 1D hollow nanotube structure of the obtained materials was formed after the sulfuration reactions.The sandwich-like hierarchical tubular structure was further identified by TEM images (Figure 1d-g).2D In 2 S 3 nanosheets in situ grew on the inner and outer surfaces of the hollow nanotube.The thickness of NH 2 -MIL-68(In) decreased with increasing sulfuration time, from 166 nm at 7 h to 63 nm at 12 h (Figure 1e,f).Prolonging the sulfuration duration to 24 h, the NH 2 -MIL-68(In) internal wall in a sandwich was completely disappeared and pure In 2 S 3 hollow nanotube was formed (Figure 1g).This result was consistent with the PXRD and FTIR analysis. To further identify the construction of the sandwich structure of the SMS(In) heterojunction composition, the selective areas of the inner and outer surfaces of SMS(In) were examined by HRTEM imaging (Figure 1h,i).Three sets of lattice fringes with spacings of 0.311, 0.324, and 0.247 nm were obvious, which were ascribed to the (222), (311), and (331) planes of In 2 S 3 , respectively. 38By contrast, no clear lattice fringes assigned to NH 2 -MIL-68(In) appeared, which may be ascribed to the low crystallinity after sulfuration (Figure 1i). 39he lattice fringes ascribed to In 2 S 3 were distributed in the areas on the right in Figure 1h,i, corresponding to the inner and outer surfaces of hollow tubes, respectively.While the indistinguishable lattice fringes in the areas on the left in Figure 1h,i were assigned to NH 2 -MIL-68(In) components next to the inner and outer surfaces of the hollow tubes in SMS(In), respectively.All of the above results and the distinct interfaces between NH 2 -MIL-68(In) and In 2 S 3 present in Figure 1h,i indicate the successful formation of an In 2 S 3 NH 2 -MIL-68(In)In 2 S 3 sandwich heterogeneous structure.Elemental X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were applied to study the interaction between In 2 S 3 and NH 2 -MIL-68(In) (Figure S6).The S 2p high-resolution XPS spectrum showed two peaks at 162.7 and 161.5 eV, assigned to the S 2p 1/2 and S 2p 3/2 orbitals of divalent sulfide ions (S 2-) in SMS(In), respectively.They exhibited a positive shift of 0.2 eV compared with In 2 S 3 , which was the signal of electron migration.For O 1s, the peaks at 531.9 and 530.2 eV were attributed to the In-O bondings and O defect in NH 2 -MIL-68(In).After sulfuration, the peak of In-O bondings slightly down-shifted to 531.8 by 0.1 eV, indicating the increase of electron cloud density around O in SMS(In).The above results proved the formation of In 2 S 3 /NH 2 -MIL-68(In)/In 2 S 3 heterojunction and certain chemical interaction between In 2 S 3 and NH 2 -MIL-68(In). 33V-vis DRS analysis showed the adsorption band edges of NH 2 -MIL-68(In) at 325 for In-O clusters and 450 nm for -NH 2 functional group, respectively. 40With the partial sulfuration, the SMS(In) composites revealed an obviously enhanced absorption in the visible-light region, even extending to 600 nm.The additional absorption in the visible range was attributed to the formation of In 2 S 3 (Figure 1c).According to the Tauc plots, 41,42 the band gap energies of NH 2 -MIL-68(In) and SMS(In)-24 were calculated as 2.28 and 1.65 eV, respectively (as the inset of Figure 1c).2 (bpy 2,2-bipyridine) as a cocatalyst and TEOA as a hole scavenger, respectively.As shown in Figure 2a, NH 2 -MIL-68(In) and SMS(In)-24 (pure In 2 S 3 ) exhibited moderate CO 2 reduction activity, with CO generation rate of 6.22 and 4.73 mol g -1 h -1 , respectively.However, SMS(In)-X (X 2 7, 12) displayed substantially improved CO 2 -to-CO conversion activities, probably benefiting from the formation of the heterogeneous structure.Strikingly, the sample of SMS(In)-7 had the highest CO production rate (11.23 mol g -1 h -1 ), even superior to the sum of the activity of NH 2 -MIL-68(In) (6.22 mol g -1 h -1 ) and In 2 S 3 (4.73mol g -1 h -1 ).This indicated the synergistic effect between In 2 S 3 and NH 2 -MIL-68(In).As shown in Table S1, this activity was comparable to that of the reported MOFbased materials in photocatalytic reduction.More importantly, it is better than that of some typical photocatalysts, including commercial P25, g-C 3 N 4 , CdS, and ZnO.Other potential reduction products such as HCOOH, CH 3 OH, and CH 4 were not detected by 1 H NMR (Figure S3) and GC. Almost no CO was produced in the control experiment under an argon atmosphere, indicating that CO 2 rather than the catalyst or solvent was the carbon source for CO (Figure 2c, column 5).Besides, no obvious CO could be detected while the reaction was performed without light irradiation or a photocatalyst, demonstrating that it was a photoinduced reaction (Figure 2c, columns 2 and 4).Remarkably, the photocatalytic performance dropped sharply in the absence of 2c, column 3). 40,43MS(In)-7 was used for consecutive four runs without a significant loss of activity, indicating excellent reusability and stability (Figure 2b). 3.3.Mechanism of Photocatalytic Enhancement.To elucidate the reasons for the excellent photocatalytic CO 2 reduction over SMS(In)-7, the adsorption capacity of CO 2 was first investigated.As shown in Figure 2d, with a high surface area and the interaction of CO 2 with the polar group -NH 2 , the maximum CO 2 uptake for NH 2 -MIL-68(In) was 1.97 mmol g -1 (1 atm, 288 K), much larger than that for SMS(In). 44,45Notably, the high CO 2 uptake capacities were preserved over SMS(In) with a shorter sulfuration time to some extent.The CO 2 uptake capacities of SMS(In)-7 (0.203 mmol g -1) showed 2.3 times increase compared with SMS(In)-24 (pure In 2 S 3 , 0.089 mmol g -1 ) particles, benefiting from the partial preservation of the precursor NH 2 -MIL-68(In).This can be explained by the existence of -NH 2 group as Lewis basic sites that are evenly distributed on the framework of MOF, which can anchor the acidic CO 2 molecules. 46,47These larger CO 2 uptake capacities helped to promote the adsorption and enrichment of CO 2 during the photocatalysis, resulting in improved activities compared with that of In 2 S 3 (SMS(In)-24). Besides, the steady-state PL spectra were also recorded to further investigate the photocatalytic properties.The high PL intensity of NH 2 -MIL-68(In) (Figure 3a) indicated the strong recombination of photoinduced e -/h , which could explain the relatively low photocatalytic activity despite of the high adsorption capacity of CO 2 .The PL intensity of SMS(In)-7 was weaker than those of NH 2 -MIL-68(In) and SMS(In)-24 (pure In 2 S 3 ), suggesting the effective separation of photogenerated charges by the heterojunction construction between NH 2 -MIL-68(In) and In 2 S 3 . 38,48,49,58More available photoinduced carriers are expected to join the photoreduction of CO 2 . With the small difference between the PL intensities of SMS(In)-7 and SMS(In)-24 (In 2 S 3 ), TRPL spectroscopy was used to further compare the recombination of the photogenerated e -and h between them.As shown in Figure 3b, the PL decay profiles could be fitted by the biexponential decay equation, indicating the two radiative decay pathways; in other words, there were two recombination pathways of photocarriers in the composite material. 50The short lifetime may be related to the free-exciton PL emission, while the long lifetime may be relevant to the trap-exciton PL emission in surface defect states. 5152253 The emission lifetimes of all single components and the average lifetimes of SMS(In)-7 were shorter than the corresponding lifetimes of SMS(In)-24 (pure In 2 S 3 ).The above results suggested that the formation of homologous heterojunction benefited the electron transfer, consequently, more photoinduced electrons can interact with substance adsorbed in the surface of materials. Additionally, the flat bands of the samples measured by the Mott-Schottky plots are exhibited in Figure 3c,d.We can see that both NH 2 -MIL-68(In) and SMS(In)-24 are n-type semiconductors with positive slopes. 54The derived flat-band potentials of NH 2 -MIL-68(In) and SMS(In)-24 were -0.6 and -0.63 eV vs Ag/AgCl (-0.40 and -0.43 eV vs NHE, pH 7), respectively, indicating their appropriate redox potentials for CO 2 photoreduction reaction. 43The conduction band (CB) of NH 2 -MIL-68(In) and SMS(In)-24 was estimated to be -0.60 and -0.63 eV vs NHE (pH 7), respectively. 55On the basis of the above discussion, the valence bands of NH 2 -MIL-68(In) and SMS(In)-24 were estimated to be 1.68 and 1.02 eV. 56herefore, the integration of NH 2 -MIL-68(In) and SMS(In)-24 could form an effective homologous type II heterojunction, which was widely used in photocatalysis to afford an improvement of the utilization of photogenerated electrons and holes.The photocatalytic mechanism is proposed in Scheme 1, where the electrons in the valence band (VB 1.02eV) were initially excited and migrated to the conduction band (CB -0.63eV) in In 2 S 3 .Supported by potential difference, the electrons in the conduction band (CB) of In 2 S 3 subsequently transferred to the conduction band (CB -0.60 eV) of NH 2 -MIL-68(In).Then, Co II (bpy) 3 2 (E(Co(bpy) 3 2/ ) -0.526eV vs NHE, pH 7, Figure S5) accepted the excited electrons from NH 2 -MIL-68(In) to generate Co I (bpy) 3 , and it preferentially reacted with CO 2 to form the intermediate Co I (bpy) 3 (CO 2 ) . 49,58The cobalt-(I) provided two electrons to CO 2 , and a six-coordinated structure of LCo III (bpy) 3 (CO 2 2-) (L TEOA or CH 3 CN) at a stable low-spin d6 configuration was formed with either TEOA or CH 3 CN. 57Afterward, such species were protonated and further reduced to afford CO, H 2 O, and the original Co(II) species."}, {"llm generation": "In 2 S 3 NH 2 -MIL-68(In)In 2 S 3 (SMS(In))", "source": "In summary, In 2 S 3 NH 2 -MIL-68(In)In 2 S 3 (SMS(In)) sandwich homologous heterojunction with a hollow nanotube structure was designed and assembled by the controllable in situ sulfuration of NH 2 -MIL-68(In) for visible-light-driven CO 2 reduction.", "context": "In summary, In 2 S 3 NH 2 -MIL-68(In)In 2 S 3 (SMS(In)) sandwich homologous heterojunction with a hollow nanotube structure was designed and assembled by the controllable in situ sulfuration of NH 2 -MIL-68(In) for visible-light-driven CO 2 reduction.The subtle design not only maintained the original merits of NH 2 -MIL-68(In) but also endowed the composite material with dual interfacial homologous heterojunction shells, which showed enhanced adsorption and mass transfer of CO 2 , abundant reactive sites, and remarkably enhanced the separation and transfer efficiency of the photoinduced charge.As a consequence, the optimum sample (SMS(In)-7) exhibited outstanding photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction with a much more excellent CO generation rate (11.23 mol g -1 h -1 ), almost 3 times that of the pure MOFderived In 2 S 3 .This work proposes an instructive pathway for constructing an atomic MOF heterojunction for artificial photosynthesis.
