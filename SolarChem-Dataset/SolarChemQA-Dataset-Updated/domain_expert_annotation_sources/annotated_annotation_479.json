Fig. 2 shows XRD patterns of the 0.99Ti-HZSM-5, 0.99TiO 2 -HZSM-5 and two reference samples TiO 2 and HZSM-5.Compared with that of the nude HZSM-5 sample, the Ti-containing samples show no any change in the position of XRD diffraction peaks, suggesting the introduction of Ti species did not destroy the MFI-type crystal structure of HZSM-5.However, for the mechanically mixed sample, 0.99TiO 2 -HZSM-5, relative intensities of the several main diffraction peaks seem to show notable change, and a small diffraction peak attributable to TiO 2 could be distinguished from the characteristic diffractions of HZSM-5 (see the inset in Fig. 2).This indicates heterogeneous dispersion of TiO 2 as small crystal particle over the pore surface of HZSM-5.By contrast, for the 0.99Ti-HZSM-5 sample, no any diffraction peak belonging to TiO 2 is observed, and the intensities of all diffraction peaks are almost comparable to that of the nude HZSM-5.This indicates that Ti species are highly dispersed on pore surface of HZSM-5 for 0.99Ti-HZSM-5. Visible Raman spectroscopy is sensitive to TiO 2 but not to HZSM-5 21, which was further applied to ascertain the difference in the chemical state of Ti species of these HZSM-5 samples.As shown in Fig. 3, TiO 2 (anatase) exhibits four Raman bands at 144, 390, 516, and 637 cm -1 , which are completely consistent with those reported in the literatures 22,23.The observed axial signal for 0.99TiO 2 -HZSM-5 is similar to the corresponding signal observed for TiO 2 (anatase).But no any Raman adsorption bands related to TiO 2 is found for the 0.99Ti-HZSM-5 sample.The Raman result supports the XRD result that the titanium oxide species can present as anatase phase nanoparticle in the 0.99TiO 2 -HZSM-5 samples, while present as a high disperse state in the 0.99Ti-HZSM-5 sample 24. It is well known that the UV absorption bands are a result of the ligand-to-metal charge transfer for metal oxides, and therefore it can be used to characterize the coordination chemistry of the metal ions in the materials containing metal species.Fig. 4 is UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of these samples.The nude anatase TiO 2 shows a wide absorption band with the biggest absorption at ca. 310 nm and a ca.380 nm of absorption edges.Such wide absorption profile is completely in accord with that of the TiO 2 nanocrystals reported in literature, indicating diversity of the chemistry states of Ti atom in the TiO 2 nanocrystals.The nude HZSM-5 shows very weak DRS absorption feature compared to the TiO 2 , but it has actually three peaks in the range of 200-500 nm (see the inset in Fig. 4), the two bands at ca. 220 and 280 nm are assigned to the charge transfer from ligand to isolated framework Fe 3 , and the band at ca. 360 nm is related to d-d electron transition of Fe 3 in tetrahedral symmetry 25,26.Weaker UV peaks of the HZSM-5 could be due to lower content and lower absorption coefficient of Fe-O species than those of Ti-O species.Compared to the nude anatase TiO 2 , both the 0.99TiO 2 -HZSM-5 and the 0.99Ti-HZSM-5 show narrower absorption band, and the absorption edges of them are shifted toward short wavelength.Interestingly, the absorption band of 0.99Ti-HZSM-5 is narrower and the absorption wavelength of absorption edge is shorter.Since the absorption wavelength of metal atom is generally blue-shifted with decreasing coordination number of it 27, the DRS characterization suggests that the Ti atoms in the 0.99Ti-HZSM-5 should be mainly present as the Ti species with lower coordination numbers 24,28, while those in the 0.99TiO 2 -HZSM-5 should be present as the TiO 2 nanoparticles 29,30, which is agreed well with XRD and Raman results. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) was used to further characterize the difference in the chemical states of Ti species in two Ti-containing HZSM-5 materials.O1s and Ti2p photoelectron spectra of the samples are shown in Fig. 5.The O1s spectrum could be deconvolved into two peaks.The one at higher binding energy is attributed to the oxygen atom of HZSM-5 31, and the other one at lower binding energy is belonged to the oxygen atom of TiO 2 32.Compared with those of 0.99TiO 2 -HZSM-5, the O1s peak at high energy of the 0.99Ti-HZSM-5 shows almost unchanged, while O1s peak of 0.99Ti-HZSM-5 at low energy shifts ca.0.3 eV toward high binding energy.This shows that the oxygen atoms in the 0.99Ti-HZSM-5 sample have lower electron density than those in 0.99TiO 2 -HZSM-5.In contrast, the Ti2p 3/2 and Ti2p 1/2 binding energies of 0.99Ti-HZSM-5 sample shift ca.0.2 eV toward low binding energy, compared to that of 0.99TiO 2 -HZSM-5 sample.The results suggest that there are more electrons transfer from O to Ti in the 0.99Ti-HZSM-5 than in the 0.99TiO 2 -HZSM-5.This indicates that polarizability of Ti O bond occurs for the surface of 0.99Ti-HZSM-5 sample, which could be explained by the Ti species bonded chemically to the surface of HZSM-5.Our previous studies show that the HZSM-5 sample contains very low content of Fe (ca 0.03 wt) 26, this content is too low to be clearly detected by XPS. All the above results show that the 0.99Ti-HZSM-5 has chemical states of Ti species different from the 0.99TiO 2 -HZSM-5.On the 0.99Ti-HZSM-5 surface, the Ti atoms could bond to the surface of HZSM-5 by O bridge, and therefore has strong interaction with the surface Fe species, which can be essential reason for higher activity of 0.99Ti-HZSM-5 than 0.99TiO 2 -HZSM-5. Texture data of the HZSM-5 and the Ti-containing HZSM-5 samples were measured by the N 2 adsorption, as listed in Table 1.It can be seen that both the specific surface areas and pore diameter of 0.99TiO 2 -HZSM-5 sample are slightly lower than that of the HZSM-5, which may be due to the pores of HZSM-5 partly blocking by TiO 2 particles.In contrast, the specific surface areas of 0.99Ti-HZSM-5 sample is a bit higher than that of the HZSM-5, but its pore diameter is a bit lower than the HZSM-5, which could be understood also by the chemical bonding of Ti species to surface oxygen atoms of TiO 2. It should be noted that such a small change of specific surface area and pore size could not induce such a difference in the photocatalytic activity between Ti-HZSM-5 and TiO 2 -HZSM-5, which could be seen from the normalized rates on the two samples.Thus, specific surface area and CO 2 adsorption capacity are not responsible for the difference in photocatalytic activity. Fig. 6 shows the photocurrent response of the samples.The 0.99Ti-HZSM-5 sample exhibits the higher photocurrent than the 0.99TiO 2 -HZSM-5 and HZSM-5 samples, indicating that 0.99Ti-HZSM-5 catalyst possesses higher efficiency of the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs than the other samples. Electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy was used to explore the electron transfer process during UV light irradiation over HZSM-5 and Ti-containing HZSM-5 catalysts.The ESR experiments were carried out at 77 K in order to slow down the rate of electron transfer.According to Fig. 7a andb, both the 0.99TiO 2 -HZSM-5 and the 0.99Ti-HZSM-5 show two wide ESR signals at g 4.27 and g 2.026-2.002, of which the former is attributed to Fe 3 333435, and the latter to O -species 29,3637383940.No Ti 3 signal is detected for two samples.For clearly, Fig. 7c shows amplifying ESR signals at g 2.026-2.002.The signal at g 2.002 can be attributed to O - species of Fe -O 40,41, and the ones at 2.013 and 2.026 can be assigned to O -species of Ti -O -Ti 36,37.Significantly, for the 0.99TiO 2 -HZSM-5, upon irradiation the signal intensity of Fe 3 is slightly decreased, but the signal of O -species (g 2.026-2.002) is considerably increased, implying that UV excitation lead to an electron transfer from O 2-to Ti 4 and to Fe 3 to form Ti 3 -O - and Fe 2 -O - over the 0.99TiO 2 -HZSM-5, respectively.But for 0.99Ti-HZSM-5, upon the UV irradiation, the intensity of Fe 3 signal keeps Table 1 Comparison of the physical properties and photocatalytic activity of different sample. BET surface area (m 2 g -1 ) Mean pore diameter (nm) A(CO2) (cm 3 g -1 ) a RCO 10 -3 (mol h -1 m -2 ) b R'CO (mol h The above results show that dependent on the introduction mode of Ti species, the resulting Ti-contained HZSM-5 samples show notable difference in the chemical states, texture, photocurrent response, and photoexcitation property.By combining with our previous data on the characterization for Fe species of HZSM-5, we suggest possible mechanism of photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 on the Ti-HZSM-5 in aqueous solution. The used HZSM-5 sample was characterized to contain ca 0.03 wt of Fe and the Fe atoms are present as tetrahedrally coordinated Fe-O species incorporated within the silica framework 26.When introduced of Ti species by sol-gel hydrolysis of tetrabutyl titanate on the HZSM-5, the Ti species is anchored to the HZSM-5 surface by coordination with the framework oxygen atoms.Because the Ti species and Fe species coexist on the surface of HZSM-5, the Fe-O and Ti-O excited states would be formed simultaneously when the sample is irradiated by UV light.The enhancement of photocatalytic performance over Ti-HZSM-5 sample is related closely to the coupling effect between the two excited states.The coupling would lead to increase in the concentration of excited electrons and acceleration of the electron transfer rate over Ti-HZSM-5.The possible mechanism of the CO 2 photoreduction over Ti-HZSM-5 is showed in Scheme 1.

X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) was used to further characterize the difference in the chemical states of Ti species in two Ti-containing HZSM-5 materials.O1s and Ti2p photoelectron spectra of the samples are shown in Fig. 5.The O1s spectrum could be deconvolved into two peaks.The one at higher binding energy is attributed to the oxygen atom of HZSM-5 31, and the other one at lower binding energy is belonged to the oxygen atom of TiO 2 32.Compared with those of 0.99TiO 2 -HZSM-5, the O1s peak at high energy of the 0.99Ti-HZSM-5 shows almost unchanged, while O1s peak of 0.99Ti-HZSM-5 at low energy shifts ca.0.3 eV toward high binding energy.This shows that the oxygen atoms in the 0.99Ti-HZSM-5 sample have lower electron density than those in 0.99TiO 2 -HZSM-5.In contrast, the Ti2p 3/2 and Ti2p 1/2 binding energies of 0.99Ti-HZSM-5 sample shift ca.0.2 eV toward low binding energy, compared to that of 0.99TiO 2 -HZSM-5 sample.The results suggest that there are more electrons transfer from O to Ti in the 0.99Ti-HZSM-5 than in the 0.99TiO 2 -HZSM-5.This indicates that polarizability of Ti O bond occurs for the surface of 0.99Ti-HZSM-5 sample, which could be explained by the Ti species bonded chemically to the surface of HZSM-5.Our previous studies show that the HZSM-5 sample contains very low content of Fe (ca 0.03 wt) 26, this content is too low to be clearly detected by XPS. All the above results show that the 0.99Ti-HZSM-5 has chemical states of Ti species different from the 0.99TiO 2 -HZSM-5.On the 0.99Ti-HZSM-5 surface, the Ti atoms could bond to the surface of HZSM-5 by O bridge, and therefore has strong interaction with the surface Fe species, which can be essential reason for higher activity of 0.99Ti-HZSM-5 than 0.99TiO 2 -HZSM-5. Texture data of the HZSM-5 and the Ti-containing HZSM-5 samples were measured by the N 2 adsorption, as listed in Table 1.It can be seen that both the specific surface areas and pore diameter of 0.99TiO 2 -HZSM-5 sample are slightly lower than that of the HZSM-5, which may be due to the pores of HZSM-5 partly blocking by TiO 2 particles.In contrast, the specific surface areas of 0.99Ti-HZSM-5 sample is a bit higher than that of the HZSM-5, but its pore diameter is a bit lower than the HZSM-5, which could be understood also by the chemical bonding of Ti species to surface oxygen atoms of TiO 2. It should be noted that such a small change of specific surface area and pore size could not induce such a difference in the photocatalytic activity between Ti-HZSM-5 and TiO 2 -HZSM-5, which could be seen from the normalized rates on the two samples.Thus, specific surface area and CO 2 adsorption capacity are not responsible for the difference in photocatalytic activity. Fig. 6 shows the photocurrent response of the samples.The 0.99Ti-HZSM-5 sample exhibits the higher photocurrent than the 0.99TiO 2 -HZSM-5 and HZSM-5 samples, indicating that 0.99Ti-HZSM-5 catalyst possesses higher efficiency of the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs than the other samples. Electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy was used to explore the electron transfer process during UV light irradiation over HZSM-5 and Ti-containing HZSM-5 catalysts.The ESR experiments were carried out at 77 K in order to slow down the rate of electron transfer.According to Fig. 7a andb, both the 0.99TiO 2 -HZSM-5 and the 0.99Ti-HZSM-5 show two wide ESR signals at g 4.27 and g 2.026-2.002, of which the former is attributed to Fe 3 333435, and the latter to O -species 29,3637383940.No Ti 3 signal is detected for two samples.For clearly, Fig. 7c shows amplifying ESR signals at g 2.026-2.002.The signal at g 2.002 can be attributed to O - species of Fe -O 40,41, and the ones at 2.013 and 2.026 can be assigned to O -species of Ti -O -Ti 36,37.Significantly, for the 0.99TiO 2 -HZSM-5, upon irradiation the signal intensity of Fe 3 is slightly decreased, but the signal of O -species (g 2.026-2.002) is considerably increased, implying that UV excitation lead to an electron transfer from O 2-to Ti 4 and to Fe 3 to form Ti 3 -O - and Fe 2 -O - over the 0.99TiO 2 -HZSM-5, respectively.But for 0.99Ti-HZSM-5, upon the UV irradiation, the intensity of Fe 3 signal keeps Table 1 Comparison of the physical properties and photocatalytic activity of different sample.

The used HZSM-5 sample was characterized to contain ca 0.03 wt of Fe and the Fe atoms are present as tetrahedrally coordinated Fe-O species incorporated within the silica framework 26.When introduced of Ti species by sol-gel hydrolysis of tetrabutyl titanate on the HZSM-5, the Ti species is anchored to the HZSM-5 surface by coordination with the framework oxygen atoms.Because the Ti species and Fe species coexist on the surface of HZSM-5, the Fe-O and Ti-O excited states would be formed simultaneously when the sample is irradiated by UV light.The enhancement of photocatalytic performance over Ti-HZSM-5 sample is related closely to the coupling effect between the two excited states.The coupling would lead to increase in the concentration of excited electrons and acceleration of the electron transfer rate over Ti-HZSM-5.The possible mechanism of the CO 2 photoreduction over Ti-HZSM-5 is showed in Scheme 1.
