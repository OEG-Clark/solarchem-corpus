The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern was carried out on a Shimadzu XRD-6000X-ray diffractometer with monochromatized Cu-K radiation.The morphology of the samples was investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (JEOL-JEM-2010) equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscope and scanning electron microscope (SEM) (JEOL JSM-7001F).Atomic force microscopy (AFM) study in the present work was performed by means of MFP-3D Origin system (Asylum Research, USA).Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra were performed using a Bruker ESR JES-FA200 spectrometer (Germany).The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was measured on a PHI5300 with a monochromatic Mg K source.The specific surface area and porosity of these materials were investigated via Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method based on N 2 adsorptiondesorption isotherms (Micromeritics Instrument Corporation, USA).The CO 2 adsorption isotherms measurements were collected on the CO 2 adsorption apparatus (Micromeritics Instrument Corporation, USA).The UV-vis spectra was carried out by UV-vis spectrometer on a UV-2450 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu Corporation, Japan), and the BaSO 4 powder as reference.The photoluminescence spectra (PL) analysis result was obtained by Varian Cary Eclipse spectrometer.The insitu FT-IR spectra were detected via in-situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (Thermo fisher Nicolet iZ10, USA).The photocurrent and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were measured in phosphate buffer solution (PBS, 0.1 M, pH 7.0) and 0.1 M KCl solution containing 5 mM Fe(CN) 6 3-/Fe(CN) 6 , respectively, and were recorded with the CHI 760E electrochemical system (Chenhua Instrument Company).A 300 W Xe lamp with a 400 nm cutoff filter was used as a light source to trigger the photocurrent response.The isotope-labeled experiment was conducted using 13 CO 2 instead of 12 CO 2 , and the products were analyzed through gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (7890A and 5975C, Agilent). The transient absorption measurements were carried out on a femtosecond amplifier laser system (Spitfire Ace, Spectra-Physics) that generates laser pulses with a repetition rate of 1 kHz, a time duration of 35 fs, and center wavelength of 800 nm.The output was split into two paths.The first path was frequency doubled to generate 400 nm excitation pulses.The second path was directed to generate ultra-broadband super-continuum probe pulses that cover almost the whole mid-IR region by focusing 800 nm fundament light and 400 nm second harmonic simultaneously on air.The time delay between the pump beam and the probe beam was controlled by a motorized delay stage, with both beams focused onto the sample.The spectrum of the mid-infrared probe light was detected by a liquid-nitrogen-cooled mercury-cadmium-telluride array detector after frequency resolved by a spectrograph (iHR 320, HORIBA Jobin Yvon). During the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction process, a top-irradiation Pyrex vessel was connected with an online closed gas circulation system (Perfect Light Company, Beijing, China) (Fig. S1).Typically, 20 mg of the photocatalysts and 10 mL of H 2 O were added into the reactor.Then, the Pyrex vessel was sealed in the circulation system and evacuated to remove all the detectable air.After that, the high purity CO 2 (purity: 99.999) was introduced into the Pyrex vessel reactor.This operation was repeated three times to ensure that the steady CO 2 environment was maintained in the reactor.Before the photocatalytic reaction, the pressure of CO 2 in the system was adjusted to 80 kPa (CO 2 aqueous solution pH 4.14, CO 2 solubility 0.0425 mol/mL), and the reaction temperature was kept at 10 C using a low-temperature thermostat bath system.A 300 W Xe lamp PLS-SXE 300C (BF), PerfectLight, Beijing with a 400 nm cutoff filter was used as light source to trigger the photocatalytic reaction.After each reaction, the gas and liquid products were analyzed using a gas chromatography (Zhejiang FuLi Chromatograph Instruments Co., Itd.GC-2002) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID), thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and capillary column.C1 gas products (CO and CH 4 ) can be separated by Hayesep A and 5A molecular sieves chromatographic column.CO was converted into CH 4 by a methanizer, while CH 4 was tested by FID. Multi-carbon gas products (such as ethylene, ethane, etc.) can be separated by Hayesep A and Porapak N chromatographic columns and detected by the FID.H 2 and O 2 can be separated by Hayesep A and 5A molecular sieves chromatographic columns and detected by the TCD.Liquid products (such as methanol, acetic acid, etc.) can be separated by the RB-InoWax capillary column and detected by the FID.The test results show that the product has only CO and the selectivity reaches 100 . DFT calculations were performed using the projected augmented wave method (PAW) 30,31, as implemented in Vienna ab-initio simulation package (VASP) 32,33.For the structural relaxation and electronic-structure calculations, the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) method was used with the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange-correlation functional 34.The electron wave function was expanded in a plane-wave basis set with an energy cutoff of 500 eV.Vacuum space of about 10 A was used in the z-direction to avoid the interaction between periodic images.The convergence criteria for structural optimization and energy on each atom were set to 0.01 eV/A and 10 -4 eV, respectively."}, {"llm generation": "monochromatic He I light source", "source": "The valence band maxima (VBMs) of these PbBiO 2 Br materials are resolved by ultraviolet photo-electron spectroscopy (UPS) with a monochromatic He I light source (hv 21.20 eV) (Fig. 2b).", "context": "The ROV PbBiO 2 Br layers were prepared via a self-assembly process using reactive ionic liquid 1-hexadecyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide (C 16 mimBr) and PVP complex (Scheme S1).The ionic liquid-PVP complex system simultaneously acts as the reactant, solvent, and capping agent, which can prevent the further growth of PbBiO 2 Br nanocrystals along the c-axis due to the formation of a passivation layer around PbBiO 2 Br cores.Similar results have been reported in other materials, such as BiOX (X Br, Cl) 14,35.Under further hydrothermal conditions, the oxygen vacancies on the surface of the ROV PbBiO 2 Br atomic layers materials can be repaired by oxygen in the water to prepare DOV PbBiO 2 Br atomic layers materials.And the original ultra-thin atomic layers structure is maintained.Similar preparation methods are also reported in other literature 36.The physicochemical properties of the prepared catalysts were characterized by a series of characterization methods.The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of ROV PbBiO 2 Br and DOV PbBiO 2 Br materials exhibit the typical sheet-like morphology (Fig. 1, Figs.S2 andS3).The HAADF-STEM-EDS elemental mapping of ROV PbBiO 2 Br atomic layers suggests the uniform distribution of Pb, Bi, O, Br elements (Fig. S4).The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM; Fig. 1b and Fig. S3c) and atomic force microscopy (AFM; Fig. 1e andf and Fig. S3b) suggest the thickness of the ultrathin nanosheet is about 1.2 nm.From the HRTEM images of Fig. 1c, it can be seen that numerous lattice disorder and defects are present in the ROV PbBiO 2 Br atomic layers surface.In addition, the lattice distance (0.28 nm) is corresponding to (1 1 0) plane of tetragonal PbBiO 2 Br, indicating that the orientation of the structure is along the 0 0 1 direction (Fig. 1d and Fig. S3d).The above results confirm that both ROV PbBiO 2 Br and DOV PbBiO 2 Br are about the size of two-unit cell layers along the c axis.X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns demonstrate that the as-synthesized samples can be indexed to the tetragonal phase of PbBiO 2 Br with the space group of I4/mmm (JCPDS: 38-1008) (Fig. 1g).Compared with the bulk PbBiO 2 Br (Fig. S2c), the weaker peak intensity and larger half peak width of the ROV PbBiO 2 Br and DOV PbBiO 2 Br atomic layers signify the smaller crystalline grain size 33.Meanwhile, the enhanced relative intensity of the (1 1 0) peak clearly reveals a highly preferred orientation of (1 1 0) in the nanosheets, consistent with the HRTEM images.Moreover, the XRD diffraction peak of ROV PbBiO 2 Br is wider than that of DOV PbBiO 2 Br, which can be attributed to the local lattice distortion induced by surface defects in ROV PbBiO 2 Br 19,37.The structures of these prepared PbBiO 2 Br materials are further analyzed by Raman spectroscopy (Fig. S5).Three distinguished Raman bands of the bulk PbBiO 2 Br at 67.8, 121.9 and 148.8 cm -1 are respectively corresponding to external A 1g , internal A 1g , and internal E 1g Pb/Bi-Br stretching modes 27,38.The external and internal A 1g and E 1g modes of PbBiO 2 Br atomic layers shift to lower and higher wavenumbers referring to the bulk materials, respectively, which can be ascribed to the phonon confinement effect caused by the ultrathin structure of these PbBiO 2 Br atomic layers 39,40.Although ROV PbBiO 2 Br and DOV PbBiO 2 Br have similar atomic layers thickness, the Raman peaks of ROV PbBiO 2 Br shift more drastically because of a higher degree of disorder resulting from the defects, consistent with the XRD patterns.To characterize the surface defects, the low-temperature electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis is employed to extract corresponding fingerprinting information regarding the trapped electrons of samples 41.When oxygen atoms are stripped from the oxide, the extra unpaired electrons are located on adjacent metal atoms.These unpaired electrons can absorb electromagnetic radiation under an appropriate magnetic field.The oxygen defects can be determined by analyzing the absorption of electromagnetic waves 42.Via comparing the peak intensity corresponding to the absorption of electromagnetic waves, the concentration of oxygen defects can be estimated 43.As shown in Fig. 1h, the EPR signal at g 2.001 is assigned to the electrons trapped on oxygen defects 6,19,39.The ROV PbBiO 2 Br atomic layers exhibit the highest EPR intensity, and the bulk PbBiO 2 Br materials show the lowest EPR signal intensity, revealing the ROV PbBiO 2 Br atomic layers contain the highest oxygen vacancies concentration, followed by DOV PbBiO 2 Br atomic layers and then bulk PbBiO 2 Br.The qualitative oxygen defect concentration is further calculated using highresolution O 1s XPS spectra (Fig. 1i).The peak at 530.7 eV is attributed to the oxygen atoms in the vicinity of an oxygen vacancy 16,44.The occupied area proportion at 530.7 eV for these materials is following the sequence: ROV PbBiO 2 Br atomic layers DOV PbBiO 2 Br atomic layers bulk PbBiO 2 Br.The Pb 4f and Bi 4f spectra of PbBiO 2 Br present typical spin-orbit doublet splitting (Fig. S6).By comparison, as the oxygen vacancies concentration increases, the Pb 4f and Bi 4f spectra gradually red-shift due to the breakage of the Pb/Bi-O bond 14.All the aforementioned results clearly demonstrate that the PbBiO 2 Br atomic layers with controllable oxygen vacancies have been successfully synthesized. The optical absorption properties of these PbBiO 2 Br samples have been probed by UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (Fig. 2a).Due to the quantum confinement effect, the initial absorption edge appears slightly red-shifted with the increase of oxygen defect concentration.Moreover, the appearance of shoulder and tail absorption for the DOV PbBiO 2 Br and ROV PbBiO 2 Br atomic layers can be attributed to a relatively high oxygen vacancy concentration 45,46.The (E photon ) 1/2 vs E photon curves calculated by the classical Tauc approach (Fig. 2a inset) reveal that the band gap energy (E g ) of the bulk PbBiO 2 Br, DOV PbBiO 2 Br and ROV PbBiO 2 Br atomic layers is 2.24, 2.21 and 2.16 eV, respectively.The valence band maxima (VBMs) of these PbBiO 2 Br materials are resolved by ultraviolet photo-electron spectroscopy (UPS) with a monochromatic He I light source (hv 21.20 eV) (Fig. 2b).The work functions () are calculated to be 2.42, 2.33 and 1.95 eV by the Fermi level (E f ) and the VBMs are 3.18, 3.24 and 3.60 eV below the E f for ROV PbBiO 2 Br atomic layers, DOV PbBiO 2 Br atomic layers and bulk PbBiO 2 Br, respectively.Therefore, according to the relationship between the potential of the vacuum energy (E abs ), and the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE, E), E -E abs -4.44 (at 298 K) 47,48, the VBMs of ROV PbBiO 2 Br atomic layers, DOV PbBiO 2 Br atomic layers and bulk PbBiO 2 Br vs NHE are 1.16, 1.13 and 1.11 V, respectively.With the combination of UPS and UV-vis diffuse reflection spectra results, the conduction band minima (CBMs) of ROV PbBiO 2 Br atomic layers, DOV PbBiO 2 Br atomic layers and bulk PbBiO 2 Br are found to be -1.00,-1.08, and -1.13 V (vs NHE), respectively.Fig. S7 reveals the energy band position of the PbBiO 2 Br materials, confirming their suitable redox potentials to drive CO 2 reduction reaction.Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are further employed to determine the electronic structure of PbBiO 2 Br with and without oxygen vacancies (Fig. 2c and Fig. S8).PbBiO 2 Br with the presence of oxygen vacancies exhibits an increased density of states (DOS) of defect level relative to the PbBiO 2 Br without defects at the conduction band edge (the yellow shadow part in Fig. 2c), indicating an easier electron transport from the valence band to the conduction band.In addition, the presence of oxygen vacancies results in the appearance of several new defect levels (the green shadow part in Fig. 2c).On the one hand, these new defect levels are beneficial to the photoexcitation of electrons to the conduction band.On the other hand, the transfer of photogenerated electrons from the conduction band to the surface defects beneficial to charge separation 49,50.This can be further verified by the optoelectronic properties of the material.The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) confirm the ROV PbBiO 2 Br atomic layers with the smallest semicircle among these samples in Nyquist plots (Fig. 2d), suggesting the lowest charge-transfer resistance in the ultra-thin structure with rich oxygendeficient defects that could permit more fast transport and separation of photogenerated charges.Meanwhile, the photocurrent intensity of the ROV PbBiO 2 Br is 1.5 and 2.5 times than that of DOV PbBiO 2 Br and bulk PbBiO 2 Br, respectively (Fig. 2e).As shown in the steady-state PL spectra (Fig. S9), the ROV PbBiO 2 Br atomic layers demonstrate the lowest intensity among these materials followed by DOV PbBiO 2 Br and then bulk PbBiO 2 Br 51, which also indicates more oxygen vacancies in PbBiO 2 Br can promote the effective separation of photogenerated carriers. In order to further understand the effect of oxygen vacancies on the excitation process, these PbBiO 2 Br samples are analyzed by using femtosecond time-resolved transient absorption spectroscopy (TA), which can track the relaxation kinetics of photogenerated electron carrier in semiconductor systems in real time (Fig. 2f and Fig. S10) 44,525354.The photogenerated electron kinetics are revealed by the 400 nm pump and mid-IR (4960 nm) probe configuration, as the 3300-8900 nm mid-IR light probe could gain similar TA kinetics for these materials, corresponding to the intraband absorption of the photoexcited electrons 54.All of these PbBiO 2 Br samples are observed with triexponential decay processes.The rapid signal rising process ( 1 ) belongs to the ultrafast cooling dynamics of the hot carriers (the transfer of photoinduced carriers to the emission state).The 2 decay process can be assigned to the photoexcited electrons that undergo a fast relaxation from CBMs to exciton-mediated trap state.Then, the obtained exactions relax into the oxygen defect-mediated trap state while dissociating into free carriers ( 3 ).The 4 decay process express that the excited state electrons eventually recombine with the holes on the nanosecond time scale.The ROV PbBiO 2 Br atomic layers ( 2 7.9 ps, 3 87 ps, 4 2.9 ns) exhibit the longest decay lifetime of the photoexcited electrons compared to DOV PbBiO 2 Br atomic layers ( 2 6.4 ps, 3 75 ps, 4 2.7 ns) and bulk PbBiO 2 Br materials ( 2 2.7 ps, 3 32 ps, 4 2.1 ns).The ultrafast TA results indicate that rich oxygen defect structure can extend the lifetime of photogenerated electrons, rendering more electrons to participate in CO 2 conversion 525354.In this system, oxygen defects are mainly distributed on the surface of materials, so electrons mainly migrate to oxygen defects on the surface of materials at this time.The more photogenerated electrons on the surface of ROV PbBiO 2 Br material further react with the adsorbed CO 2 . The CO 2 photoreduction experiments are carried out in water under visible light irradiation without any sacrificial reagents or photosensitizers.In the photoreaction, both gaseous and liquid products are analyzed by gas chromatography and only CO can be found as the product.The selectivity of CO 2 to CO conversion achieves 100 .As shown in Fig. 3a, the bulk PbBiO 2 Br is almost inactive to photo-reduce CO 2 -to-CO under visible light irradiation.The ROV PbBiO 2 Br enables a deoxygenative CO 2 reduction with a CO evolving rate of 4.58 mol g -1 h -1 , which is 2.05 times higher than that of the DOV PbBiO 2 Br (2.23 mol g -1 h -1 ) and 10.90 times higher than that of bulk PbBiO 2 Br (0.42 mol g -1 h -1 ) (Fig. 3b).Moreover, under 300 W Xe lamp irradiation, the ROV PbBiO 2 Br atomic layer displays a CO formation rate of 31.14 mol g -1 h -1 , 1.63 and 4.51 times higher than that of DOV PbBiO 2 Br atomic layer (19.15 mol g -1 h -1 ) and bulk PbBiO 2 Br (6.91 mol g -1 h -1 ) (Fig. S11).These values are comparable or superior to many other reported semiconductor systems, such as (1) Bi 4 O 5 Br 2 microsphere (CO yield: 2.73 mol g -1 h -1 ), ultrathin BiOBr (CO yield: 2.67 mol g -1 h -1 ), BiOBr microsphere (CO yield: 1.68 mol g -1 h -1 ) (light source: 300 W Xenon lamp) 55, (2) BOCl-OV UV-vis (CO yield: 8.757 mol g -1 h -1 ), BOCl UV-vis (CO yield: 3.695 mol g -1 h -1 ), BOCl-OV vis (CO yield: 2.165 mol g -1 h -1 ), BOCl vis (CO yield: 0.583 mol g -1 h -1 ) (light source: 300 W Xenon lamp) 56, (3) Bi 2 MoO 6 nanosheets (CO yield: 3.62 mol g -1 h -1 ), bulk Bi 2 MoO 6 (CO yield: 1.42 mol g -1 h -1 ) (light source: 300 W Xenon lamp) 57, (4) ultrathin TiO 2 flakes (CO yield: 1.9 mol g -1 h -1 ) (light source: 300 W Hg lamp) 58, etc.The statistics of the photocatalytic CO 2 conversion performance of more materials in reported literature are shown in Table S1.The control experiments without photocatalysts, in Ar atmosphere or in dark did not show the evolution of CO, implying the formation of CO is indeed root in the reduction of CO 2 under illumination (Fig. S12).In addition, the 13 C isotope labeling experiment further verifies the carbon source of the generated CO.The peak at m/z 29 in the mass spectra can be assigned to 13 CO, indicating the CO 2 is indeed the carbon source of the generated CO (Fig. 3c).Moreover, the peak at m/z 32 in the mass spectra can be assigned to O 2 , confirming the holes can oxidize water to produce oxygen.The stability experiment reveals that the ROV PbBiO 2 Br still maintains most of its original photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance under visible light irradiation after 26 h (Fig. 3d).The XRD, Raman, high-resolution O 1s XPS spectra and TEM images demonstrate that there are no significant changes in the structure, morphology, and oxygen defect concentration of the ROV PbBiO 2 Br before and after cycling photocatalytic CO 2 reduction experiments (Fig. S13).These characterization data further confirm the compelling light stability of the ROV PbBiO 2 Br material. The possible factors governing the excellent performance of ROV PbBiO 2 Br atomic layers in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction are further explored in detail.In addition to the separation of photogenerated carriers, the ability of the catalyst to adsorb and capture reactants is also considered as a critical factor for catalytic performance.According to DFT theoretical calculations (Fig. 4a andb, Figs.S14 and S15 and Tables S2 andS3), the adsorption energy of CO 2 molecules on the PbBiO 2 Br surface without oxygen vacancy and with one oxygen vacancy are -0.019eV and -0.159 eV, respectively.As shown in Fig. 4a and b, the difference in the charge distribution suggests that a stronger covalent interaction is formed between the oxygen vacancy and the CO 2 molecule in ROV PbBiO 2 Br atomic layers.At the same plotting scale, the charge difference for the pristine PbBiO 2 Br surface is too small to be visible.Moreover, after CO 2 adsorption on oxygen vacancy sites, the OeCeO bond angle changes from 180to 178.5579, and one of the CeO bonding length increases from 1.1766 A to 1.1859 A, the other CeO bonding length decreases from 1.1766 A to 1.1673 A (Table S3).However, the CO 2 molecules activation on the surface of pristine PbBiO 2 Br material is extremely hard.This implies a stronger binding of CO 2 molecule on the surface with oxygen vacancy, which is beneficial for the catalyst to capture more CO 2 to participate in the reduction reaction 59,60.The CO 2 adsorption isotherms further validate this argument (Fig. 4c).The ROV PbBiO 2 Br exhibits the maximum CO 2 uptake of 2.56 cm 3 g -1 at 10 C under 1 atm, which is higher than that of DOV PbBiO 2 Br (2.05 cm 3 g -1 ) and bulk PbBiO 2 Br (1.84 cm 3 g -1 ), indicating that the ROV PbBiO 2 Br demonstrate pronounced advantages in CO 2 adsorption/activation 61,62.The nitrogen absorption-desorption isotherms of bulk PbBiO 2 Br, DOV PbBiO 2 Br and ROV PbBiO 2 Br samples indicate these materials demonstrate the similar specific surface area (Fig. S16), further indicating that the CO 2 capture capability of these PbBiO 2 Br samples is affected by the concentration of oxygen defects. In order to further explore the reaction pathway for CO 2 -to-CO photoreduction, the in-situ Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) measurement is employed for the ROV PbBiO 2 Br (Fig. 4d).The intensity of absorption peaks at 1525, 1552 and 1716 cm -1 gradually increases along with the extended visible light irradiation time from 0 to 120 min, which can be ascribed to the COOH species 63,64.This indicates the COOH groups are the important intermediates during the CO 2 to CO photoreduction process.Many literature indicated that the formation of COOH is the rate-limiting step during the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 to CO 65,66.Therefore, the possible photocatalytic CO 2 reduction mechanism of the ROV PbBiO 2 Br atomic layers photocatalyst can be proposed as follows: where \"\" represents the corresponding adsorption state on the catalyst surface. Under visible light irradiation, the excited electronic transition of the ROV PbBiO 2 Br is from the valence band to the conduction band, forming photogenerated electron-hole pairs.Afterwards, the photoinduced electrons can be captured by the oxygen vacancies on the surface of ROV PbBiO 2 Br atomic layers, leading to efficient separation of photogenerated carriers.The adsorbed CO 2 molecules on the oxygen vacancies sites directly interact with the surface protons and generate the COOH intermediate.The further protonation of COOH intermediate generates CO as the product.In the photocatalytic conversion CO 2 to CO process, the rich oxygen vacancies not only act as the separation and transfer center of photogenerated electrons but also serve as the site for the adsorption of CO 2 , thus promoting photocatalytic CO 2 conversion reaction."}, {"llm generation": "visible light", "source": "Fig. 3.

The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern was carried out on a Shimadzu XRD-6000X-ray diffractometer with monochromatized Cu-K radiation.The morphology of the samples was investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (JEOL-JEM-2010) equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscope and scanning electron microscope (SEM) (JEOL JSM-7001F).Atomic force microscopy (AFM) study in the present work was performed by means of MFP-3D Origin system (Asylum Research, USA).Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra were performed using a Bruker ESR JES-FA200 spectrometer (Germany).The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was measured on a PHI5300 with a monochromatic Mg K source.The specific surface area and porosity of these materials were investigated via Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method based on N 2 adsorptiondesorption isotherms (Micromeritics Instrument Corporation, USA).The CO 2 adsorption isotherms measurements were collected on the CO 2 adsorption apparatus (Micromeritics Instrument Corporation, USA).The UV-vis spectra was carried out by UV-vis spectrometer on a UV-2450 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu Corporation, Japan), and the BaSO 4 powder as reference.The photoluminescence spectra (PL) analysis result was obtained by Varian Cary Eclipse spectrometer.The insitu FT-IR spectra were detected via in-situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (Thermo fisher Nicolet iZ10, USA).The photocurrent and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were measured in phosphate buffer solution (PBS, 0.1 M, pH 7.0) and 0.1 M KCl solution containing 5 mM Fe(CN) 6 3-/Fe(CN) 6 , respectively, and were recorded with the CHI 760E electrochemical system (Chenhua Instrument Company).A 300 W Xe lamp with a 400 nm cutoff filter was used as a light source to trigger the photocurrent response.The isotope-labeled experiment was conducted using 13 CO 2 instead of 12 CO 2 , and the products were analyzed through gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (7890A and 5975C, Agilent). The transient absorption measurements were carried out on a femtosecond amplifier laser system (Spitfire Ace, Spectra-Physics) that generates laser pulses with a repetition rate of 1 kHz, a time duration of 35 fs, and center wavelength of 800 nm.The output was split into two paths.The first path was frequency doubled to generate 400 nm excitation pulses.The second path was directed to generate ultra-broadband super-continuum probe pulses that cover almost the whole mid-IR region by focusing 800 nm fundament light and 400 nm second harmonic simultaneously on air.The time delay between the pump beam and the probe beam was controlled by a motorized delay stage, with both beams focused onto the sample.The spectrum of the mid-infrared probe light was detected by a liquid-nitrogen-cooled mercury-cadmium-telluride array detector after frequency resolved by a spectrograph (iHR 320, HORIBA Jobin Yvon). During the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction process, a top-irradiation Pyrex vessel was connected with an online closed gas circulation system (Perfect Light Company, Beijing, China) (Fig. S1).Typically, 20 mg of the photocatalysts and 10 mL of H 2 O were added into the reactor.Then, the Pyrex vessel was sealed in the circulation system and evacuated to remove all the detectable air.After that, the high purity CO 2 (purity: 99.999) was introduced into the Pyrex vessel reactor.This operation was repeated three times to ensure that the steady CO 2 environment was maintained in the reactor.Before the photocatalytic reaction, the pressure of CO 2 in the system was adjusted to 80 kPa (CO 2 aqueous solution pH 4.14, CO 2 solubility 0.0425 mol/mL), and the reaction temperature was kept at 10 C using a low-temperature thermostat bath system.A 300 W Xe lamp PLS-SXE 300C (BF), PerfectLight, Beijing with a 400 nm cutoff filter was used as light source to trigger the photocatalytic reaction.After each reaction, the gas and liquid products were analyzed using a gas chromatography (Zhejiang FuLi Chromatograph Instruments Co., Itd.GC-2002) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID), thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and capillary column.C1 gas products (CO and CH 4 ) can be separated by Hayesep A and 5A molecular sieves chromatographic column.CO was converted into CH 4 by a methanizer, while CH 4 was tested by FID. Multi-carbon gas products (such as ethylene, ethane, etc.) can be separated by Hayesep A and Porapak N chromatographic columns and detected by the FID.H 2 and O 2 can be separated by Hayesep A and 5A molecular sieves chromatographic columns and detected by the TCD.Liquid products (such as methanol, acetic acid, etc.) can be separated by the RB-InoWax capillary column and detected by the FID.The test results show that the product has only CO and the selectivity reaches 100 . DFT calculations were performed using the projected augmented wave method (PAW) 30,31, as implemented in Vienna ab-initio simulation package (VASP) 32,33.For the structural relaxation and electronic-structure calculations, the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) method was used with the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange-correlation functional 34.The electron wave function was expanded in a plane-wave basis set with an energy cutoff of 500 eV.Vacuum space of about 10 A was used in the z-direction to avoid the interaction between periodic images.The convergence criteria for structural optimization and energy on each atom were set to 0.01 eV/A and 10 -4 eV, respectively."}, {"llm generation": "300 W Xe lamp", "source": "Moreover, under 300 W Xe lamp irradiation, the ROV PbBiO 2 Br atomic layer displays a CO formation rate of 31.14 mol g -1 h -1 , 1.63 and 4.51 times higher than that of DOV PbBiO 2 Br atomic layer (19.15 mol g -1 h -1 ) and bulk PbBiO 2 Br (6.91 mol g -1 h -1 ) (Fig. S11).", "context": "The ROV PbBiO 2 Br layers were prepared via a self-assembly process using reactive ionic liquid 1-hexadecyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide (C 16 mimBr) and PVP complex (Scheme S1).The ionic liquid-PVP complex system simultaneously acts as the reactant, solvent, and capping agent, which can prevent the further growth of PbBiO 2 Br nanocrystals along the c-axis due to the formation of a passivation layer around PbBiO 2 Br cores.Similar results have been reported in other materials, such as BiOX (X Br, Cl) 14,35.Under further hydrothermal conditions, the oxygen vacancies on the surface of the ROV PbBiO 2 Br atomic layers materials can be repaired by oxygen in the water to prepare DOV PbBiO 2 Br atomic layers materials.And the original ultra-thin atomic layers structure is maintained.Similar preparation methods are also reported in other literature 36.The physicochemical properties of the prepared catalysts were characterized by a series of characterization methods.The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of ROV PbBiO 2 Br and DOV PbBiO 2 Br materials exhibit the typical sheet-like morphology (Fig. 1, Figs.S2 andS3).The HAADF-STEM-EDS elemental mapping of ROV PbBiO 2 Br atomic layers suggests the uniform distribution of Pb, Bi, O, Br elements (Fig. S4).The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM; Fig. 1b and Fig. S3c) and atomic force microscopy (AFM; Fig. 1e andf and Fig. S3b) suggest the thickness of the ultrathin nanosheet is about 1.2 nm.From the HRTEM images of Fig. 1c, it can be seen that numerous lattice disorder and defects are present in the ROV PbBiO 2 Br atomic layers surface.In addition, the lattice distance (0.28 nm) is corresponding to (1 1 0) plane of tetragonal PbBiO 2 Br, indicating that the orientation of the structure is along the 0 0 1 direction (Fig. 1d and Fig. S3d).The above results confirm that both ROV PbBiO 2 Br and DOV PbBiO 2 Br are about the size of two-unit cell layers along the c axis.X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns demonstrate that the as-synthesized samples can be indexed to the tetragonal phase of PbBiO 2 Br with the space group of I4/mmm (JCPDS: 38-1008) (Fig. 1g).Compared with the bulk PbBiO 2 Br (Fig. S2c), the weaker peak intensity and larger half peak width of the ROV PbBiO 2 Br and DOV PbBiO 2 Br atomic layers signify the smaller crystalline grain size 33.Meanwhile, the enhanced relative intensity of the (1 1 0) peak clearly reveals a highly preferred orientation of (1 1 0) in the nanosheets, consistent with the HRTEM images.Moreover, the XRD diffraction peak of ROV PbBiO 2 Br is wider than that of DOV PbBiO 2 Br, which can be attributed to the local lattice distortion induced by surface defects in ROV PbBiO 2 Br 19,37.The structures of these prepared PbBiO 2 Br materials are further analyzed by Raman spectroscopy (Fig. S5).Three distinguished Raman bands of the bulk PbBiO 2 Br at 67.8, 121.9 and 148.8 cm -1 are respectively corresponding to external A 1g , internal A 1g , and internal E 1g Pb/Bi-Br stretching modes 27,38.The external and internal A 1g and E 1g modes of PbBiO 2 Br atomic layers shift to lower and higher wavenumbers referring to the bulk materials, respectively, which can be ascribed to the phonon confinement effect caused by the ultrathin structure of these PbBiO 2 Br atomic layers 39,40.Although ROV PbBiO 2 Br and DOV PbBiO 2 Br have similar atomic layers thickness, the Raman peaks of ROV PbBiO 2 Br shift more drastically because of a higher degree of disorder resulting from the defects, consistent with the XRD patterns.To characterize the surface defects, the low-temperature electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis is employed to extract corresponding fingerprinting information regarding the trapped electrons of samples 41.When oxygen atoms are stripped from the oxide, the extra unpaired electrons are located on adjacent metal atoms.These unpaired electrons can absorb electromagnetic radiation under an appropriate magnetic field.The oxygen defects can be determined by analyzing the absorption of electromagnetic waves 42.Via comparing the peak intensity corresponding to the absorption of electromagnetic waves, the concentration of oxygen defects can be estimated 43.As shown in Fig. 1h, the EPR signal at g 2.001 is assigned to the electrons trapped on oxygen defects 6,19,39.The ROV PbBiO 2 Br atomic layers exhibit the highest EPR intensity, and the bulk PbBiO 2 Br materials show the lowest EPR signal intensity, revealing the ROV PbBiO 2 Br atomic layers contain the highest oxygen vacancies concentration, followed by DOV PbBiO 2 Br atomic layers and then bulk PbBiO 2 Br.The qualitative oxygen defect concentration is further calculated using highresolution O 1s XPS spectra (Fig. 1i).The peak at 530.7 eV is attributed to the oxygen atoms in the vicinity of an oxygen vacancy 16,44.The occupied area proportion at 530.7 eV for these materials is following the sequence: ROV PbBiO 2 Br atomic layers DOV PbBiO 2 Br atomic layers bulk PbBiO 2 Br.The Pb 4f and Bi 4f spectra of PbBiO 2 Br present typical spin-orbit doublet splitting (Fig. S6).By comparison, as the oxygen vacancies concentration increases, the Pb 4f and Bi 4f spectra gradually red-shift due to the breakage of the Pb/Bi-O bond 14.All the aforementioned results clearly demonstrate that the PbBiO 2 Br atomic layers with controllable oxygen vacancies have been successfully synthesized. The optical absorption properties of these PbBiO 2 Br samples have been probed by UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (Fig. 2a).Due to the quantum confinement effect, the initial absorption edge appears slightly red-shifted with the increase of oxygen defect concentration.Moreover, the appearance of shoulder and tail absorption for the DOV PbBiO 2 Br and ROV PbBiO 2 Br atomic layers can be attributed to a relatively high oxygen vacancy concentration 45,46.The (E photon ) 1/2 vs E photon curves calculated by the classical Tauc approach (Fig. 2a inset) reveal that the band gap energy (E g ) of the bulk PbBiO 2 Br, DOV PbBiO 2 Br and ROV PbBiO 2 Br atomic layers is 2.24, 2.21 and 2.16 eV, respectively.The valence band maxima (VBMs) of these PbBiO 2 Br materials are resolved by ultraviolet photo-electron spectroscopy (UPS) with a monochromatic He I light source (hv 21.20 eV) (Fig. 2b).The work functions () are calculated to be 2.42, 2.33 and 1.95 eV by the Fermi level (E f ) and the VBMs are 3.18, 3.24 and 3.60 eV below the E f for ROV PbBiO 2 Br atomic layers, DOV PbBiO 2 Br atomic layers and bulk PbBiO 2 Br, respectively.Therefore, according to the relationship between the potential of the vacuum energy (E abs ), and the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE, E), E -E abs -4.44 (at 298 K) 47,48, the VBMs of ROV PbBiO 2 Br atomic layers, DOV PbBiO 2 Br atomic layers and bulk PbBiO 2 Br vs NHE are 1.16, 1.13 and 1.11 V, respectively.With the combination of UPS and UV-vis diffuse reflection spectra results, the conduction band minima (CBMs) of ROV PbBiO 2 Br atomic layers, DOV PbBiO 2 Br atomic layers and bulk PbBiO 2 Br are found to be -1.00,-1.08, and -1.13 V (vs NHE), respectively.Fig. S7 reveals the energy band position of the PbBiO 2 Br materials, confirming their suitable redox potentials to drive CO 2 reduction reaction.Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are further employed to determine the electronic structure of PbBiO 2 Br with and without oxygen vacancies (Fig. 2c and Fig. S8).PbBiO 2 Br with the presence of oxygen vacancies exhibits an increased density of states (DOS) of defect level relative to the PbBiO 2 Br without defects at the conduction band edge (the yellow shadow part in Fig. 2c), indicating an easier electron transport from the valence band to the conduction band.In addition, the presence of oxygen vacancies results in the appearance of several new defect levels (the green shadow part in Fig. 2c).On the one hand, these new defect levels are beneficial to the photoexcitation of electrons to the conduction band.On the other hand, the transfer of photogenerated electrons from the conduction band to the surface defects beneficial to charge separation 49,50.This can be further verified by the optoelectronic properties of the material.The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) confirm the ROV PbBiO 2 Br atomic layers with the smallest semicircle among these samples in Nyquist plots (Fig. 2d), suggesting the lowest charge-transfer resistance in the ultra-thin structure with rich oxygendeficient defects that could permit more fast transport and separation of photogenerated charges.Meanwhile, the photocurrent intensity of the ROV PbBiO 2 Br is 1.5 and 2.5 times than that of DOV PbBiO 2 Br and bulk PbBiO 2 Br, respectively (Fig. 2e).As shown in the steady-state PL spectra (Fig. S9), the ROV PbBiO 2 Br atomic layers demonstrate the lowest intensity among these materials followed by DOV PbBiO 2 Br and then bulk PbBiO 2 Br 51, which also indicates more oxygen vacancies in PbBiO 2 Br can promote the effective separation of photogenerated carriers. In order to further understand the effect of oxygen vacancies on the excitation process, these PbBiO 2 Br samples are analyzed by using femtosecond time-resolved transient absorption spectroscopy (TA), which can track the relaxation kinetics of photogenerated electron carrier in semiconductor systems in real time (Fig. 2f and Fig. S10) 44,525354.The photogenerated electron kinetics are revealed by the 400 nm pump and mid-IR (4960 nm) probe configuration, as the 3300-8900 nm mid-IR light probe could gain similar TA kinetics for these materials, corresponding to the intraband absorption of the photoexcited electrons 54.All of these PbBiO 2 Br samples are observed with triexponential decay processes.The rapid signal rising process ( 1 ) belongs to the ultrafast cooling dynamics of the hot carriers (the transfer of photoinduced carriers to the emission state).The 2 decay process can be assigned to the photoexcited electrons that undergo a fast relaxation from CBMs to exciton-mediated trap state.Then, the obtained exactions relax into the oxygen defect-mediated trap state while dissociating into free carriers ( 3 ).The 4 decay process express that the excited state electrons eventually recombine with the holes on the nanosecond time scale.The ROV PbBiO 2 Br atomic layers ( 2 7.9 ps, 3 87 ps, 4 2.9 ns) exhibit the longest decay lifetime of the photoexcited electrons compared to DOV PbBiO 2 Br atomic layers ( 2 6.4 ps, 3 75 ps, 4 2.7 ns) and bulk PbBiO 2 Br materials ( 2 2.7 ps, 3 32 ps, 4 2.1 ns).The ultrafast TA results indicate that rich oxygen defect structure can extend the lifetime of photogenerated electrons, rendering more electrons to participate in CO 2 conversion 525354.In this system, oxygen defects are mainly distributed on the surface of materials, so electrons mainly migrate to oxygen defects on the surface of materials at this time.The more photogenerated electrons on the surface of ROV PbBiO 2 Br material further react with the adsorbed CO 2 . The CO 2 photoreduction experiments are carried out in water under visible light irradiation without any sacrificial reagents or photosensitizers.In the photoreaction, both gaseous and liquid products are analyzed by gas chromatography and only CO can be found as the product.The selectivity of CO 2 to CO conversion achieves 100 .As shown in Fig. 3a, the bulk PbBiO 2 Br is almost inactive to photo-reduce CO 2 -to-CO under visible light irradiation.The ROV PbBiO 2 Br enables a deoxygenative CO 2 reduction with a CO evolving rate of 4.58 mol g -1 h -1 , which is 2.05 times higher than that of the DOV PbBiO 2 Br (2.23 mol g -1 h -1 ) and 10.90 times higher than that of bulk PbBiO 2 Br (0.42 mol g -1 h -1 ) (Fig. 3b).Moreover, under 300 W Xe lamp irradiation, the ROV PbBiO 2 Br atomic layer displays a CO formation rate of 31.14 mol g -1 h -1 , 1.63 and 4.51 times higher than that of DOV PbBiO 2 Br atomic layer (19.15 mol g -1 h -1 ) and bulk PbBiO 2 Br (6.91 mol g -1 h -1 ) (Fig. S11).These values are comparable or superior to many other reported semiconductor systems, such as (1) Bi 4 O 5 Br 2 microsphere (CO yield: 2.73 mol g -1 h -1 ), ultrathin BiOBr (CO yield: 2.67 mol g -1 h -1 ), BiOBr microsphere (CO yield: 1.68 mol g -1 h -1 ) (light source: 300 W Xenon lamp) 55, (2) BOCl-OV UV-vis (CO yield: 8.757 mol g -1 h -1 ), BOCl UV-vis (CO yield: 3.695 mol g -1 h -1 ), BOCl-OV vis (CO yield: 2.165 mol g -1 h -1 ), BOCl vis (CO yield: 0.583 mol g -1 h -1 ) (light source: 300 W Xenon lamp) 56, (3) Bi 2 MoO 6 nanosheets (CO yield: 3.62 mol g -1 h -1 ), bulk Bi 2 MoO 6 (CO yield: 1.42 mol g -1 h -1 ) (light source: 300 W Xenon lamp) 57, (4) ultrathin TiO 2 flakes (CO yield: 1.9 mol g -1 h -1 ) (light source: 300 W Hg lamp) 58, etc.The statistics of the photocatalytic CO 2 conversion performance of more materials in reported literature are shown in Table S1.The control experiments without photocatalysts, in Ar atmosphere or in dark did not show the evolution of CO, implying the formation of CO is indeed root in the reduction of CO 2 under illumination (Fig. S12).In addition, the 13 C isotope labeling experiment further verifies the carbon source of the generated CO.The peak at m/z 29 in the mass spectra can be assigned to 13 CO, indicating the CO 2 is indeed the carbon source of the generated CO (Fig. 3c).Moreover, the peak at m/z 32 in the mass spectra can be assigned to O 2 , confirming the holes can oxidize water to produce oxygen.The stability experiment reveals that the ROV PbBiO 2 Br still maintains most of its original photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance under visible light irradiation after 26 h (Fig. 3d).The XRD, Raman, high-resolution O 1s XPS spectra and TEM images demonstrate that there are no significant changes in the structure, morphology, and oxygen defect concentration of the ROV PbBiO 2 Br before and after cycling photocatalytic CO 2 reduction experiments (Fig. S13).These characterization data further confirm the compelling light stability of the ROV PbBiO 2 Br material. The possible factors governing the excellent performance of ROV PbBiO 2 Br atomic layers in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction are further explored in detail.In addition to the separation of photogenerated carriers, the ability of the catalyst to adsorb and capture reactants is also considered as a critical factor for catalytic performance.According to DFT theoretical calculations (Fig. 4a andb, Figs.S14 and S15 and Tables S2 andS3), the adsorption energy of CO 2 molecules on the PbBiO 2 Br surface without oxygen vacancy and with one oxygen vacancy are -0.019eV and -0.159 eV, respectively.As shown in Fig. 4a and b, the difference in the charge distribution suggests that a stronger covalent interaction is formed between the oxygen vacancy and the CO 2 molecule in ROV PbBiO 2 Br atomic layers.At the same plotting scale, the charge difference for the pristine PbBiO 2 Br surface is too small to be visible.Moreover, after CO 2 adsorption on oxygen vacancy sites, the OeCeO bond angle changes from 180to 178.5579, and one of the CeO bonding length increases from 1.1766 A to 1.1859 A, the other CeO bonding length decreases from 1.1766 A to 1.1673 A (Table S3).However, the CO 2 molecules activation on the surface of pristine PbBiO 2 Br material is extremely hard.This implies a stronger binding of CO 2 molecule on the surface with oxygen vacancy, which is beneficial for the catalyst to capture more CO 2 to participate in the reduction reaction 59,60.The CO 2 adsorption isotherms further validate this argument (Fig. 4c).The ROV PbBiO 2 Br exhibits the maximum CO 2 uptake of 2.56 cm 3 g -1 at 10 C under 1 atm, which is higher than that of DOV PbBiO 2 Br (2.05 cm 3 g -1 ) and bulk PbBiO 2 Br (1.84 cm 3 g -1 ), indicating that the ROV PbBiO 2 Br demonstrate pronounced advantages in CO 2 adsorption/activation 61,62.The nitrogen absorption-desorption isotherms of bulk PbBiO 2 Br, DOV PbBiO 2 Br and ROV PbBiO 2 Br samples indicate these materials demonstrate the similar specific surface area (Fig. S16), further indicating that the CO 2 capture capability of these PbBiO 2 Br samples is affected by the concentration of oxygen defects. In order to further explore the reaction pathway for CO 2 -to-CO photoreduction, the in-situ Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) measurement is employed for the ROV PbBiO 2 Br (Fig. 4d).The intensity of absorption peaks at 1525, 1552 and 1716 cm -1 gradually increases along with the extended visible light irradiation time from 0 to 120 min, which can be ascribed to the COOH species 63,64.This indicates the COOH groups are the important intermediates during the CO 2 to CO photoreduction process.Many literature indicated that the formation of COOH is the rate-limiting step during the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 to CO 65,66.Therefore, the possible photocatalytic CO 2 reduction mechanism of the ROV PbBiO 2 Br atomic layers photocatalyst can be proposed as follows: where \"\" represents the corresponding adsorption state on the catalyst surface. Under visible light irradiation, the excited electronic transition of the ROV PbBiO 2 Br is from the valence band to the conduction band, forming photogenerated electron-hole pairs.Afterwards, the photoinduced electrons can be captured by the oxygen vacancies on the surface of ROV PbBiO 2 Br atomic layers, leading to efficient separation of photogenerated carriers.The adsorbed CO 2 molecules on the oxygen vacancies sites directly interact with the surface protons and generate the COOH intermediate.The further protonation of COOH intermediate generates CO as the product.In the photocatalytic conversion CO 2 to CO process, the rich oxygen vacancies not only act as the separation and transfer center of photogenerated electrons but also serve as the site for the adsorption of CO 2 , thus promoting photocatalytic CO 2 conversion reaction."}], "reaction medium": [], "reactor type": [], "operation mode": []}}
