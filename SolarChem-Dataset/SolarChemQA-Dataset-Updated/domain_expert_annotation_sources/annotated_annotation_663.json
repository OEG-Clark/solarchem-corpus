Dispersion of synthetic solution was performed using an Ultrasonic Homogenizer (UHP-400, made in Ultrasonic Technology Development company-Iran).The structural characterization was performed using a X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) diffractometer (Philips PW-1840, Holland) with Cu-K radiation (1.54A), at a scanning speed of 2/min from 20 to 75(2).The functional groups of the samples were identified by FT-IR (400-4000 cm -region) and XPS analysis using a 8300 FT-IR Shimadzu spectrophotometer and XPS, ESCALab250Xi respectively.FE-SEM and TEM images were taken for the morphological characterization of the synthesized samples using a TEM, JEM-2100HR and FE-SEM, HITACHI S-4160 (30KV) respectively.The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of the photocatalysts were recorded using a UV-2600 UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-2600) in the range of 200-800nm.Shimadzu UV-2600 was equipped with an integrating sphere, and barium sulfate was applied as a standard.photoluminescence spectra (PL spectra) were recorded by a fluorescence spectrophotometer (F-2700 Hitachi, Japan) using a Xe lamp (260nm). 100 mL of 0.01 mol/L AgNO3 solution was mixed with 100 mL 10 gL -1 polyethylene glycol 400 and sonicated for 5 min.100mL 0.05 molL -1 K2CrO4 solution was added gradually.After stirring for 2 h, the achieved Ag2CrO4 precipitate was collected, washed with ethanol and DI water and finally dried in vacuum oven at 70C for 12 h.NG was synthesized according to the hydrazine steaming process 40.summarily, Hummers' method was applied for preparing of GO in the presence of 10 mL 60 N2H4, at 100C for 4 h.Finally, NG was collected and dried for 12 h.For synthesis of PI, 2.5 g MA and 4.36 g PMDA 41424344 were mixed and posited in an ultrasonic bath, raised to 325C at a rate of 7Cmin -1 for 3 h.The obtained sediment was collected, washed and dried AT 70 C for 10 h. Ag2CrO4/NG was synthesized by adding of NG (1 g) to a 10 mL of ethanol in 100 Ml baker and then Ag2CrO4 was added into baker.The achieved solution was sonicated for 2 and stirred for 6 h.The final product (Ag2CrO4/NG) was dried in a vacuum oven at 60C for 12 h.PI/NG and Ag2CrO4/PI were all synthesized by the explained method.To prepare of Ag2CrO4/NG/PI photocatalysts, PI/NG powder (0.20 g) and different amounts of Ag2CrO4 (with distinct molar ratios) were mixed in 100 mL of DI water, sonicated for 20 min and stirred for 6 h continuously.the acheived sediment was Xe-irradiated during 45 min.Then it was centrifugated, washed with distilled water, and dried in a vacuum oven at 65 o C for 24 h.In this procedure, various molar ratios of the Ag2CrO4 to NG/PI (i.e. 5 , 15, 25, 35, and 50 Ag2CrO4 to NG/PI), were obtained and denoted as 5AN, 15AN, 25AN, 35AN, and 50AN, respectively. The evaluation of photocatalytic potentiality of the synthesized composites (Ag2CrO4/NG, PI/NG, Ag2CrO4/PI and Ag2CrO4/NG/PI (5-5-AN)) was performed for the conversion of CO2 to different range of fuels under sunlight irradiation condition.In a photocatalytic reactor, the photocatalytic experiments were performed as it is shown in Fig. The amount considered for the catalyst was 10 mg and 4 mL deionized water was poured into the bottom of the reactor.A 500 W Xenon lamp was applied as the light source.The estimated light intensity at the position of catalyst was 180 mW/cm 2 and a decrease in the light intensity to about 105 mW/cm 2 was observed after the use of UV cutoff filter (400 nm).The light irradiation was preceded by the purge of the above system with CO2 for ten times.The CO2 pressure and the photoreaction temperature were kept to be 0.4 MPa and 80 o C respectively.The analysis of the gas product after light irradiation for 4 h has been carried out by a SRI 8610C gas chromatograph which was equipped with the columns of 6' HAYESEP-D ,6' MS-13X, and 60M MXT-1 in two FID detectors and one TCD detector.Under the irradiation of a 350 W Xenon lamp the photocatalytic degradation of RhB (10 mg/L) was performed whlie the UV and infrared light (400-800 were filtered by optical filters.The initial volume of RhB solution and the photocatalyst amount were 100 mL and 0.10 g respectively.Irradiation was preceded by the agitation of the mixture for 45 min to guarantee adsorption/desorption equilibrium at 27 C.In order to analyze the produced sediment it was centrifuged and seprated.The concentration of aqueous solution of RhB was measured at 554 nm. Additionally, photoactivity for RhB was determined in the absence of the photocatalyst.The photocatalyst was preceded by an introduction of a number of scavengers into the RhB solution.Based on the prior studies 42,43, the concentration of scavengers and benzoquinone was 10 -2 and 10 -4 M respectively.With a standard trinary -electrode system, electrochemical evaluations were performed at r.t..In this setup, Ag, AgCl and Pt wire were applied as the working, reference and counter electrodes.The provision of working electrodes based on the literature reported 44 was done in this way that first a 25.5 cm indium tin oxide (ITO) glass piece was sonicated in acetone, immersed in boiling sodium hydroxide (0.1 M), rinsed with deionized water and dried in an air stream afterwards.The ITO glass substrate was then coated by a suspension of 200 mg of the powder in 1 mL of ethanol.Subsequently, the coated glass was heated for 90 h at 180 C in air to help better adhesion.A copper wire was attached to the side part of the 031), ( 211), ( 002), ( 131), ( 122), ( 240), ( 222), (400), ( 242), ( 213) and (431) crystal planes of the orthorhombic.The noticeably strong and sharp peaks demonstrate that the Ag2CrO4 is well-crystalline, and unveiling that the pure orthorhombic Ag2CrO4 is composed during the mentioned procedure.Moreover the XRD patterns of 5 AN, 15 AN, 35 AN and 50 AN was showed in Fig. S2 that confirm the structure of the synthesized nanocomposites."}, {"llm generation": "Ag2CrO4/PI", "source": "It is mentioned that the XRD analysis of Ag2CrO4/PI, Ag2CrO4/NG and 25AN show the similar signals as bare Ag2CrO4, but the intensities of 25AN peaks are stronger than that of Ag2CrO4/PI and Ag2CrO4/NG.", "context": "The (211) crystal plane of Ag2CrO4 structure attributed to the diffraction peak at 231.4.It is mentioned that the XRD analysis of Ag2CrO4/PI, Ag2CrO4/NG and 25AN show the similar signals as bare Ag2CrO4, but the intensities of 25AN peaks are stronger than that of Ag2CrO4/PI and Ag2CrO4/NG.Therefore, the ternary nanocomposits is more impressive than the duplex compound to confirm the original crystal structure of Ag2CrO4 from being ruined.After decomposition the XRD pattern of the photocatalysts showed the corresponding peaks with reduced intensity, but they maintained basically unaffected, demonstrating the high resistance of the synthesized catalysts.The morphological properties of the synthesized compounds was studied by FE-SEM, TEM and AFM (Fig. 2 and3).3c andd as rippling sheets.In addition, it was clear that the Ag2CrO4 -NPs in the Ag2CrO4/PI (Fig. 3e) and Ag2CrO4/NG (Fig. 3f) are immobilized on the surfaces of PI and NG, respectively. In Fig. 2 c, it clearly observed that globular shaped Ag2CrO4 NPs are immobilized on NG and PI.XPS analysis probed the chemical composition of the as prepared nanocomposites that shown in Fig. S2 andS3.The XPS spectrum of NG was shown in Fig. S3a FT-IR spectra of the synthesized compounds (Fig. 5) confirm the achieved XRD results.FT-IR spectrum of Ag2CrO4, showed the strong and sharp band at 877 cm -1 that can be attributed to Cr-O stretching vibration in CrO4 2- 54.meanwhile, FT-IR spectrums of 5AN, 15AN, 35 AN and 50 AN were showed in Fig. S4 that reveals the structure of these compounds. FT-IR analysis of duplex and triplex compounds was performed to recognize the functional groups of the synthesized compounds.Fig. 5 shows FT-IR spectrum of NG shows a peaks at 1385 cm -1 that can be assigned to the vibrational mode of C-N bonds 55.Consequently this peak approves the doping of N on the graphene surface.Meanwhile, the FT-IR spectrum of PI, contains several bands at 1376, 1725, 1772, and 725 cm -1 that can be attributed to the carbonnitrogen stretching mode, asymmetric stretching, symmetrical stretching and bending modes of the imidic ring absorption peak 56.The similarity of Ag2CrO4 signal intensities in FT-IR spectrum of duplex and triplex nanocatalysts confirms the XRD results.The electronic properties of the synthesized compounds (Ag2CrO4, Ag2CrO4/PI, Ag2CrO4/NG and 25AN) were investigated using UV-vis DRS.Fig. 6 showed the UV-vis DRS of Ag2CrO4 that contains a broad signal at the range of 500-600 nm which can be attributed to Ag2CrO4.The UV-vis DRS of Ag2CrO4/PI, Ag2CrO4/NG and 25AN nanocomposites show higher intensities peculiarly in UV region.The UV-vis DRS absorption peaks are more intense than Ag2CrO4 at the 400-800 nm except that Ag2CrO4/PI is moderately decreased at the range of 450-800 nm.As expected, the absorption intensity 25AN is enhanced in the vis light.The enhanced intensity of UV-vis DRS absorption of the synthesized compounds can be assigned to two reducing agents including of grephenoxide and PI that reduces the reflection of light.Hence, it can be found that the presence of NG and PI would simplify the improvement of vis-absorbance and also facilitate the chare separation phenomena in the nanocomposites toward the light, leads to improvement of photo-assisted catalytic efficiency.Fig. 6b presents the valence band energy of the compounds that was acheived by the Kubelka-Munk formula.The band gap of PI, Ag2CrO4 and 25AN composite photocatalysts are 2.78eV, 1.72 eV, 1.08 eV, respectively.Accord with the obtained data, the combination of Ag2CrO4, NG and PI resulted in decreasing the band gap of the photocatalyst, and increasing the UV-vis DRS absorption region of Ag2CrO4. The photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra of Ag2CrO4, Ag2CrO4/PI, Ag2CrO4/NG and 25AN composites were exhibited in Fig. 7a.The characteristic peak of these photocatalysts appears at 534 nm.As shown in Fig. 7a the photoluminescence intensity directly relates to the reconstruction of EHPs.Compared with bare Ag2CrO4, the PL intensity of Ag2CrO4-based catalyst is clearly quenched, that demonstrates that the combination of NG and PI can impressively affect on the charge separation of the compounds which resulted in the enhancement of photo-assisted catalytic performance.Fig. 7b showed that the initial photocurrent density of Ag2CrO4 was 0.8Acm -2 , but its photocurrent density decayed rapidly and decreased to 0.3 Acm -2 after 500 s, which indicates that Ag2CrO4 was unstable under visible light (420nm).The photocurrent density of PI was 0.15Acm -2 , and it was still stable under visible light within 500s. The photocurrent density of 25AN composites was 2Acm -2 , which was 2.5 times that of Ag2CrO4 and far exceeded the sum of Ag2CrO4 and PI.It suggests that there was a synergistic effect between Ag2CrO4 and PI to significantly enhance the photoelectric response intensity and effectively inhibit the photo-corrosion.It was also observed that the photoluminescence intensity of 25AN (Fig. 6) was weakened due to the introduction of PI and NG to increase the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs caused by the charge transport between Ag2CrO4 and PI, thereby improving the photocatalytic performance of 25AN.EIS is a powerful tool for studying a material's electrochemical conductivity properties.The EIS Nyquist plots of the materials shown in Fig. 7c andd were measured in the frequency range of 106-0.1 Hz with amplitude of 5 mV at a bias potential of 0 V versus Ag/AgCl.The impedance of the EIS Nyquist plots is the impedance of the catalyst, catalyst/electrolyte and catalyst/catalyst interface.The lower the impedance is, the higher the efficiency of the photogenerated carrier separation and the lower the interface resistance are.The minimum interfacial impedance (50) of 25AN composite implies that the composite has better electron transport capability and higher photogenerated carrier separation efficiency than Ag2CrO4 or PI alone 57,58.From the above photoelectrochemical analysis, it can be deduced that the photocatalytic activity and stability of 25AN composite are derived from its stable and efficient photoelectric conversion property, excellent photogenerated carrier separation efficiency and electron transport capability. Raman spectroscopy as a powerful and non-destructive method has been widely applied to characterize the structure and electronic properties of carbon materials, such as NG.Fig. 8 shows typical Raman spectra of NG and 25AN.This Fig presents two intense Raman features, which are assigned to G (1581 cm -1 ) and 2D (2674 cm -1 ) peaks 59.In addition to these two peaks, NG and 25AN present a strong D peak located at 1344 cm -1 , which is activated by defects, i.e., in-plane substitution heteroatoms, vacancies, or grain boundaries/ edges 60, through an intervalley double resonance Raman process.The appearance of D peak in NG (ID/IG 1.25) and 25AN (ID/IG 1.3) indicates that there are similar numbers of defects in these two samples, due to the substitution of nitrogen dopants and the introduction of vacancies during ion bombardment.An additional peak located at 1620 cm -1 (D0 peak) is also observed for NG and 25AN, which originates from the intravalley double resonance scattering process 60.However, the D0 peak of NG is more prominent compared to that of DG; in the other words, ID/ID0 is smaller for NG with similar amount of defects.This is related to different natures of defects in NG and 25AN It is well known that the BET specific surface area is commonly considered as an important influencing factor of the photocatalytic performance of photocatalyst.Generally, photocatalytic degradation is an interfacial reaction, a large BET specific surface area can provide more adsorption sites for CO2 photoreduction due to the adsorption of CO2 on the surface of photocatalyst is usually considered as the initial step in the decomposition of CO2, so increasing the contact opportunities between CO2 and photocatalyst, finally achieving excellent CO2 photoreduction.As a consequence, in order to determine the specific surface areas of the asobtained samples, nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms were carried out.It can be found that the nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms of all the samples displayed type IV with a H3 hysteresis loops according to the Brunauer-Deming-Deming-Teller (BDDT) classification demonstrating that the asynthesized samples have mesoporous surface.Moreover, the BET specific surface area of 25AN is 63.8 m 2 /g, which is much higher than that of Ag2CrO4 (1.79 m 2 /g). The outcomes of photocatalytic performance assessments of the Ag2CrO4/NG/PI nano-composites (5AN-50AN), Ag2CrO4, Ag2CrO4/NG, Ag2CrO4/PI and NG/PI which were examined by the photoreduction of CO2 are presented in Fig. 9a.Carbon monoxide (CO), methanol (MeOH), methane (CH4), and ethanol (EtOH) were produced. Moreover, in the absence of light irradiation or diverse photocatalyst, the blank test was done which indicated that the products could be neglected.The rate of CO2 reduction was 10.0 molh -1 g cat -1 was demonstrated by pure NG. The achieved products were carbonmonoxide, methane, or methanol, and ethanol.(Actually from a theoretical point of view, other products including of hydrogen and oxygen should be observed because H2O was another reactant . It is noteworthy that the undetectability of the two products was due to two factors including the low sensitivity of the TCD detector and low concentration of them.)The diverse distribution of the achieved product using these photo assisted catalysts can mainly be ascribed to their varied conduction band positions.Due to the strong redox ability of the photogenerated electrons in NG, it can reduce CO2 to either MeOH or EtOH 62.Accordingly, no photocatalytic reduction of CO2 was acheived over the pure Ag2CrO4 catalyst.The separation efficiency of EHP and the ability of light absorption can be promoted by the deposition of Ag2CrO4 on NG leading to the enhancement of catalytic performance for photoreduction of CO2.A gradual increase in the photocatalytic activity of Ag2CrO4/NG/PI was observed with an increase of Ag2CrO4 concentration from 10 to 30 .Later on, excessive deposition of Ag2CrO4 could result in shielding of the active site on NG surfaces which subsequently leads to the catalytic efficiency reduction.Notably, the 25AN sample showed the highest rate of 68.32 molh -1 gcat -1 for CO2 reduction which was 6.8 times higher than of NG.Fig. 9a shows the comparable charts indicating photocatalytic conversion CO2 in presence of different samples.It is clearly observed that CO2 reduction has been significantly promoted from 10.0 to 68.32 molh -1 g cat -1 by doping of Ag2CrO4-NPs on NG.However, in comparison with 30AC, the photoactivity of Ag2CrO4/NG was still much lower which confirmed the superiority of the Ag2CrO4/NG/PI hetero-junction.The high photoactivity of the Ag2CrO4/NG/PI composites has been corroborated, albeit their stability in regard to practical applications was not evident.Consequently, a eight-run cycling reduction test has been performed in order to investigate about the stability of the optimal Ag2CrO4/NG/PI hybrid (25AN).Based on the results (Fig. 9b), after the decrease in the first four cycling runs, the CO2 conversion rate altered slightly indicating the stability of Ag2CrO4/NG/PI hybrids in the reaction.To gain further knowledge, the composites photoactivity under visible light irradiation (450 nm), besides their stability, was investigated.Based on the results a significant decrease up to 21.4 molh -1 gcat -1 was observed for the CO2 conversion rate of 25AN.However, in comparison with the activity of NG (10.0 molh -1 gcat -1 ), the promotion effect of Ag2CrO4 was still apparent.As previously been noticed, both the decreased light intensity and the limited absorbed light could be responsible for the reduced photoactivity under visible light 63.The effectiveness of utilizing light of shorter wavelength (255 nm) in irradiation in comparison with 350 nm for CO2 photoreduction by titanium oxide has been delineated 63.However, the low photocataltyic activity under visible light offered challenges for the promising reaction of photocatalytic CO2 reduction into fuels.Indeed, Ag2CrO4/NG/PI hybrid demonstrated great catalytic activity for RhB photodegradation.The RhB solution under visible light irradiation for 17 min could entirely be blanched in the presence of the 25AN sample, with a degradation rate of 0.24 min -1 , which was 6.3 times higher than those of NG and 3.7 times higher than those of Ag2CrO4. In general photo-assisted catalytic process have approved that two key factors including the absorption of light capacity and ability of EHPs separation improve the photocatalyst efficiency.meanwhile, in the case of the nanaocomposites such as Ag2CrO4/NG/PI high surface area is advantageous for the better performance as a photocatalyst for CO2 reduction.FE-SEM and AFM experiments has confirmed that the higher surface areas contribute to higher catalytic activities of Ag2CrO4/NG/PI nanocomposites.According to the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra, the addition of Ag2CrO4 could enhance the photoassisted catalytic function of NG, however, this could not demonstrate its high performance of photoactivity.Moreover, the photoluminescence spectra, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and photocurrent analysis, showed that the addition of Ag2CrO4 to NG could considerably increase the distance of EHPs, which, as previously reported, was based on the high photoassisted catalytic performance of Ag/graphene based nano composites 646566.The silver ions should exhibit its important role in separation of EHPs since Ag -NPs were also constructed the nanocomposite 67686970.Nevertheless, the key role of the coupling effect of Ag2CrO4 and NG has been confirmed by photocatalytic results but an subject respecting the transfer route of the photoassisted charge transfer process in the system still remained.Therefore a doubletransmission mechanism can be suggested for photocatalytic performance of the Ag2CrO4/NG/PI 646566.This mechanism indicates that the photogenerated electron in the conduction band of NG would transfer to that of Ag2CrO4, while the holes amass on the valance band of NG.Therefore, the electron and holes were properly separated.Moreover, since the electrons in the conduction band of Ag2CrO4 and holes in the valance band of NG owned adequate redutive or oxidiative ability to decompose dye molecules, such a mechanism would function for dye photodassisted-decomposition.In the current case, however, the double-transmission system could not explicate the effectivness of Ag2CrO4/NG/PI in photoassisted-catalytic function on CO2 reduction.Thus, CO2 reduction can not be promoted by the addition of Ag2CrO4 to NG if the Ag2CrO4/NG/PI nanocomposites follow the double-transmission system.Ag2CrO4/Ag 0 , can be assumed to conform with a Z-scheme photocatalytic system 71, which brought on the belief that the Z-scheme photoassisted-catalytic mechanism probably works in the Ag2CrO4 /NG/PI composite since NG and Ag2CrO4 have same conduction and valance bands positions.Moreover, the similarity of the distances between these bands has an important role to follow Z-scheme photoassisted-catalytic mechanism.Probably Ag nanoparticles function as a charge conduction bridge to create the Ag2CrO4/NG/PI Z-scheme photoassistedcatalytic mechanism.Two simultaneous events happen in this phase first the photogenerated electrons in the Notably this form of charge transfer can elevate the EHPs distance and enable the electrons and holes to stay on the conduction band of NG and valence band of Ag2CrO4, respectively.These electrons, owing to the negative ECB of NG, with their strong reducibility can simply abate CO2 to CH4, CO, MeOH, and EtOH.The obtained result is congruent with the results in Fig. 4a.Photoassisted catalytic system of Ag2CrO4/NG/PI composite is shown in Fig. 5. In order to scrutinize the most important effective compounds in the oxidative photoassisted catalytic of RhB over the Ag2CrO4/NG/PI nanocomposites, the reactive species harvesting tests have been designed.These experiments are beneficial in concluding the charge transmission path in the composite 72,73.The photoassisted-catalytic process of 25AN with diverse quenchers is exhibited in Fig. S5.Remarkably, no obvious effect for IPA or Isopropanol as an OH60-62 quencher on the degradation rate of RhB has been observed.However, the introduction of benzoquinone (BQ, O2 -scavenger) 73,74 decreased the RhB decomposition rate from 0.2 min -1 to 0.02 and EDTA (h scavenger) introduction 74,75 decreased it to 0.11 min -1 , suggesting that O2 -and h were the most important effective species in the photoassisted-catalytic processes of Ag2CrO4/NG/PI nanocomposites.Also, the reactive species harvesting tests were done using the same procedure for the samples of Ag2CrO4and NG.The results (Fig. 8d) indicated that h was the foremost effective compounds in the RhB decomposition of Ag2CrO4, which was in line with the prior published articles 75 The result is admissible by bearing in mind that the conduction band potential of Ag2CrO4is much lower than the standard reduction ability of O2 -/O2,.Similar to Ag2CrO4/NG/PI, the foremost reactive species for pure NG are O2 -and h.Undoubtedly, the conduction band of NG the electron can be improved by electrons that reduces O2 to O 2 -in Ag2CrO4/NG/PI only when the electron and holes transfer by the Zscheme mechanism.If not, accumulation of the photo-excited electron on the conduction band of Ag2CrO4 leads to the controlling effective species of h, which is incongruent with the obtained results.The provided data in Fig. 8d confirm that efficient Ag2CrO4/NG/PI nanocomposites follow the photoassisted catalytic Z-scheme system.Under these circumstances, the photoassisted catalytic EH in the hybrides are segregated properly and hence an excellent photocatalytic activity is achieved.In the current study, the great effectiveness of photoassisted catalytic Z-scheme system is demonstrated, and a promising method or the photocatalytic abatement of CO2 to fuels, also, the environmental protection of air pollution utilizing photo-assisted catalytic approach is provided."}, {"llm generation": "Ag2CrO4/NG", "source": "It is mentioned that the XRD analysis of Ag2CrO4/PI, Ag2CrO4/NG and 25AN show the similar signals as bare Ag2CrO4, but the intensities of 25AN peaks are stronger than that of Ag2CrO4/PI and Ag2CrO4/NG.", "context": "The (211) crystal plane of Ag2CrO4 structure attributed to the diffraction peak at 231.4.It is mentioned that the XRD analysis of Ag2CrO4/PI, Ag2CrO4/NG and 25AN show the similar signals as bare Ag2CrO4, but the intensities of 25AN peaks are stronger than that of Ag2CrO4/PI and Ag2CrO4/NG.Therefore, the ternary nanocomposits is more impressive than the duplex compound to confirm the original crystal structure of Ag2CrO4 from being ruined.After decomposition the XRD pattern of the photocatalysts showed the corresponding peaks with reduced intensity, but they maintained basically unaffected, demonstrating the high resistance of the synthesized catalysts.The morphological properties of the synthesized compounds was studied by FE-SEM, TEM and AFM (Fig. 2 and3).3c andd as rippling sheets.In addition, it was clear that the Ag2CrO4 -NPs in the Ag2CrO4/PI (Fig. 3e) and Ag2CrO4/NG (Fig. 3f) are immobilized on the surfaces of PI and NG, respectively.

The photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra of Ag2CrO4, Ag2CrO4/PI, Ag2CrO4/NG and 25AN composites were exhibited in Fig. 7a.The characteristic peak of these photocatalysts appears at 534 nm.As shown in Fig. 7a the photoluminescence intensity directly relates to the reconstruction of EHPs.Compared with bare Ag2CrO4, the PL intensity of Ag2CrO4-based catalyst is clearly quenched, that demonstrates that the combination of NG and PI can impressively affect on the charge separation of the compounds which resulted in the enhancement of photo-assisted catalytic performance.Fig. 7b showed that the initial photocurrent density of Ag2CrO4 was 0.8Acm -2 , but its photocurrent density decayed rapidly and decreased to 0.3 Acm -2 after 500 s, which indicates that Ag2CrO4 was unstable under visible light (420nm).The photocurrent density of PI was 0.15Acm -2 , and it was still stable under visible light within 500s. The photocurrent density of 25AN composites was 2Acm -2 , which was 2.5 times that of Ag2CrO4 and far exceeded the sum of Ag2CrO4 and PI.It suggests that there was a synergistic effect between Ag2CrO4 and PI to significantly enhance the photoelectric response intensity and effectively inhibit the photo-corrosion.It was also observed that the photoluminescence intensity of 25AN (Fig. 6) was weakened due to the introduction of PI and NG to increase the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs caused by the charge transport between Ag2CrO4 and PI, thereby improving the photocatalytic performance of 25AN.EIS is a powerful tool for studying a material's electrochemical conductivity properties.The EIS Nyquist plots of the materials shown in Fig. 7c andd were measured in the frequency range of 106-0.1 Hz with amplitude of 5 mV at a bias potential of 0 V versus Ag/AgCl.The impedance of the EIS Nyquist plots is the impedance of the catalyst, catalyst/electrolyte and catalyst/catalyst interface.The lower the impedance is, the higher the efficiency of the photogenerated carrier separation and the lower the interface resistance are.The minimum interfacial impedance (50) of 25AN composite implies that the composite has better electron transport capability and higher photogenerated carrier separation efficiency than Ag2CrO4 or PI alone 57,58.From the above photoelectrochemical analysis, it can be deduced that the photocatalytic activity and stability of 25AN composite are derived from its stable and efficient photoelectric conversion property, excellent photogenerated carrier separation efficiency and electron transport capability. Raman spectroscopy as a powerful and non-destructive method has been widely applied to characterize the structure and electronic properties of carbon materials, such as NG.Fig. 8 shows typical Raman spectra of NG and 25AN.This Fig presents two intense Raman features, which are assigned to G (1581 cm -1 ) and 2D (2674 cm -1 ) peaks 59.In addition to these two peaks, NG and 25AN present a strong D peak located at 1344 cm -1 , which is activated by defects, i.e., in-plane substitution heteroatoms, vacancies, or grain boundaries/ edges 60, through an intervalley double resonance Raman process.The appearance of D peak in NG (ID/IG 1.25) and 25AN (ID/IG 1.3) indicates that there are similar numbers of defects in these two samples, due to the substitution of nitrogen dopants and the introduction of vacancies during ion bombardment.An additional peak located at 1620 cm -1 (D0 peak) is also observed for NG and 25AN, which originates from the intravalley double resonance scattering process 60.However, the D0 peak of NG is more prominent compared to that of DG; in the other words, ID/ID0 is smaller for NG with similar amount of defects.This is related to different natures of defects in NG and 25AN It is well known that the BET specific surface area is commonly considered as an important influencing factor of the photocatalytic performance of photocatalyst.Generally, photocatalytic degradation is an interfacial reaction, a large BET specific surface area can provide more adsorption sites for CO2 photoreduction due to the adsorption of CO2 on the surface of photocatalyst is usually considered as the initial step in the decomposition of CO2, so increasing the contact opportunities between CO2 and photocatalyst, finally achieving excellent CO2 photoreduction.As a consequence, in order to determine the specific surface areas of the asobtained samples, nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms were carried out.It can be found that the nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms of all the samples displayed type IV with a H3 hysteresis loops according to the Brunauer-Deming-Deming-Teller (BDDT) classification demonstrating that the asynthesized samples have mesoporous surface.Moreover, the BET specific surface area of 25AN is 63.8 m 2 /g, which is much higher than that of Ag2CrO4 (1.79 m 2 /g). The outcomes of photocatalytic performance assessments of the Ag2CrO4/NG/PI nano-composites (5AN-50AN), Ag2CrO4, Ag2CrO4/NG, Ag2CrO4/PI and NG/PI which were examined by the photoreduction of CO2 are presented in Fig. 9a.Carbon monoxide (CO), methanol (MeOH), methane (CH4), and ethanol (EtOH) were produced. Moreover, in the absence of light irradiation or diverse photocatalyst, the blank test was done which indicated that the products could be neglected.The rate of CO2 reduction was 10.0 molh -1 g cat -1 was demonstrated by pure NG. The achieved products were carbonmonoxide, methane, or methanol, and ethanol.(Actually from a theoretical point of view, other products including of hydrogen and oxygen should be observed because H2O was another reactant . It is noteworthy that the undetectability of the two products was due to two factors including the low sensitivity of the TCD detector and low concentration of them.)The diverse distribution of the achieved product using these photo assisted catalysts can mainly be ascribed to their varied conduction band positions.Due to the strong redox ability of the photogenerated electrons in NG, it can reduce CO2 to either MeOH or EtOH 62.Accordingly, no photocatalytic reduction of CO2 was acheived over the pure Ag2CrO4 catalyst.The separation efficiency of EHP and the ability of light absorption can be promoted by the deposition of Ag2CrO4 on NG leading to the enhancement of catalytic performance for photoreduction of CO2.A gradual increase in the photocatalytic activity of Ag2CrO4/NG/PI was observed with an increase of Ag2CrO4 concentration from 10 to 30 .Later on, excessive deposition of Ag2CrO4 could result in shielding of the active site on NG surfaces which subsequently leads to the catalytic efficiency reduction.Notably, the 25AN sample showed the highest rate of 68.32 molh -1 gcat -1 for CO2 reduction which was 6.8 times higher than of NG.Fig. 9a shows the comparable charts indicating photocatalytic conversion CO2 in presence of different samples.It is clearly observed that CO2 reduction has been significantly promoted from 10.0 to 68.32 molh -1 g cat -1 by doping of Ag2CrO4-NPs on NG.However, in comparison with 30AC, the photoactivity of Ag2CrO4/NG was still much lower which confirmed the superiority of the Ag2CrO4/NG/PI hetero-junction.The high photoactivity of the Ag2CrO4/NG/PI composites has been corroborated, albeit their stability in regard to practical applications was not evident.Consequently, a eight-run cycling reduction test has been performed in order to investigate about the stability of the optimal Ag2CrO4/NG/PI hybrid (25AN).Based on the results (Fig. 9b), after the decrease in the first four cycling runs, the CO2 conversion rate altered slightly indicating the stability of Ag2CrO4/NG/PI hybrids in the reaction.To gain further knowledge, the composites photoactivity under visible light irradiation (450 nm), besides their stability, was investigated.Based on the results a significant decrease up to 21.4 molh -1 gcat -1 was observed for the CO2 conversion rate of 25AN.However, in comparison with the activity of NG (10.0 molh -1 gcat -1 ), the promotion effect of Ag2CrO4 was still apparent.As previously been noticed, both the decreased light intensity and the limited absorbed light could be responsible for the reduced photoactivity under visible light 63.The effectiveness of utilizing light of shorter wavelength (255 nm) in irradiation in comparison with 350 nm for CO2 photoreduction by titanium oxide has been delineated 63.However, the low photocataltyic activity under visible light offered challenges for the promising reaction of photocatalytic CO2 reduction into fuels.Indeed, Ag2CrO4/NG/PI hybrid demonstrated great catalytic activity for RhB photodegradation.The RhB solution under visible light irradiation for 17 min could entirely be blanched in the presence of the 25AN sample, with a degradation rate of 0.24 min -1 , which was 6.3 times higher than those of NG and 3.7 times higher than those of Ag2CrO4. In general photo-assisted catalytic process have approved that two key factors including the absorption of light capacity and ability of EHPs separation improve the photocatalyst efficiency.meanwhile, in the case of the nanaocomposites such as Ag2CrO4/NG/PI high surface area is advantageous for the better performance as a photocatalyst for CO2 reduction.FE-SEM and AFM experiments has confirmed that the higher surface areas contribute to higher catalytic activities of Ag2CrO4/NG/PI nanocomposites.According to the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra, the addition of Ag2CrO4 could enhance the photoassisted catalytic function of NG, however, this could not demonstrate its high performance of photoactivity.Moreover, the photoluminescence spectra, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and photocurrent analysis, showed that the addition of Ag2CrO4 to NG could considerably increase the distance of EHPs, which, as previously reported, was based on the high photoassisted catalytic performance of Ag/graphene based nano composites 646566.The silver ions should exhibit its important role in separation of EHPs since Ag -NPs were also constructed the nanocomposite 67686970.Nevertheless, the key role of the coupling effect of Ag2CrO4 and NG has been confirmed by photocatalytic results but an subject respecting the transfer route of the photoassisted charge transfer process in the system still remained.Therefore a doubletransmission mechanism can be suggested for photocatalytic performance of the Ag2CrO4/NG/PI 646566.This mechanism indicates that the photogenerated electron in the conduction band of NG would transfer to that of Ag2CrO4, while the holes amass on the valance band of NG.Therefore, the electron and holes were properly separated.Moreover, since the electrons in the conduction band of Ag2CrO4 and holes in the valance band of NG owned adequate redutive or oxidiative ability to decompose dye molecules, such a mechanism would function for dye photodassisted-decomposition.In the current case, however, the double-transmission system could not explicate the effectivness of Ag2CrO4/NG/PI in photoassisted-catalytic function on CO2 reduction.Thus, CO2 reduction can not be promoted by the addition of Ag2CrO4 to NG if the Ag2CrO4/NG/PI nanocomposites follow the double-transmission system.Ag2CrO4/Ag 0 , can be assumed to conform with a Z-scheme photocatalytic system 71, which brought on the belief that the Z-scheme photoassisted-catalytic mechanism probably works in the Ag2CrO4 /NG/PI composite since NG and Ag2CrO4 have same conduction and valance bands positions.Moreover, the similarity of the distances between these bands has an important role to follow Z-scheme photoassisted-catalytic mechanism.Probably Ag nanoparticles function as a charge conduction bridge to create the Ag2CrO4/NG/PI Z-scheme photoassistedcatalytic mechanism.Two simultaneous events happen in this phase first the photogenerated electrons in the Notably this form of charge transfer can elevate the EHPs distance and enable the electrons and holes to stay on the conduction band of NG and valence band of Ag2CrO4, respectively.These electrons, owing to the negative ECB of NG, with their strong reducibility can simply abate CO2 to CH4, CO, MeOH, and EtOH.The obtained result is congruent with the results in Fig. 4a.Photoassisted catalytic system of Ag2CrO4/NG/PI composite is shown in Fig. 5. In order to scrutinize the most important effective compounds in the oxidative photoassisted catalytic of RhB over the Ag2CrO4/NG/PI nanocomposites, the reactive species harvesting tests have been designed.These experiments are beneficial in concluding the charge transmission path in the composite 72,73.The photoassisted-catalytic process of 25AN with diverse quenchers is exhibited in Fig. S5.Remarkably, no obvious effect for IPA or Isopropanol as an OH60-62 quencher on the degradation rate of RhB has been observed.However, the introduction of benzoquinone (BQ, O2 -scavenger) 73,74 decreased the RhB decomposition rate from 0.2 min -1 to 0.02 and EDTA (h scavenger) introduction 74,75 decreased it to 0.11 min -1 , suggesting that O2 -and h were the most important effective species in the photoassisted-catalytic processes of Ag2CrO4/NG/PI nanocomposites.Also, the reactive species harvesting tests were done using the same procedure for the samples of Ag2CrO4and NG.The results (Fig. 8d) indicated that h was the foremost effective compounds in the RhB decomposition of Ag2CrO4, which was in line with the prior published articles 75 The result is admissible by bearing in mind that the conduction band potential of Ag2CrO4is much lower than the standard reduction ability of O2 -/O2,.Similar to Ag2CrO4/NG/PI, the foremost reactive species for pure NG are O2 -and h.Undoubtedly, the conduction band of NG the electron can be improved by electrons that reduces O2 to O 2 -in Ag2CrO4/NG/PI only when the electron and holes transfer by the Zscheme mechanism.If not, accumulation of the photo-excited electron on the conduction band of Ag2CrO4 leads to the controlling effective species of h, which is incongruent with the obtained results.The provided data in Fig. 8d confirm that efficient Ag2CrO4/NG/PI nanocomposites follow the photoassisted catalytic Z-scheme system.Under these circumstances, the photoassisted catalytic EH in the hybrides are segregated properly and hence an excellent photocatalytic activity is achieved.In the current study, the great effectiveness of photoassisted catalytic Z-scheme system is demonstrated, and a promising method or the photocatalytic abatement of CO2 to fuels, also, the environmental protection of air pollution utilizing photo-assisted catalytic approach is provided."}, {"llm generation": "25AN", "source": "It is mentioned that the XRD analysis of Ag2CrO4/PI, Ag2CrO4/NG and 25AN show the similar signals as bare Ag2CrO4, but the intensities of 25AN peaks are stronger than that of Ag2CrO4/PI and Ag2CrO4/NG.", "context": "The (211) crystal plane of Ag2CrO4 structure attributed to the diffraction peak at 231.4.It is mentioned that the XRD analysis of Ag2CrO4/PI, Ag2CrO4/NG and 25AN show the similar signals as bare Ag2CrO4, but the intensities of 25AN peaks are stronger than that of Ag2CrO4/PI and Ag2CrO4/NG.Therefore, the ternary nanocomposits is more impressive than the duplex compound to confirm the original crystal structure of Ag2CrO4 from being ruined.After decomposition the XRD pattern of the photocatalysts showed the corresponding peaks with reduced intensity, but they maintained basically unaffected, demonstrating the high resistance of the synthesized catalysts.The morphological properties of the synthesized compounds was studied by FE-SEM, TEM and AFM (Fig. 2 and3).3c andd as rippling sheets.In addition, it was clear that the Ag2CrO4 -NPs in the Ag2CrO4/PI (Fig. 3e) and Ag2CrO4/NG (Fig. 3f) are immobilized on the surfaces of PI and NG, respectively. In Fig. 2 c, it clearly observed that globular shaped Ag2CrO4 NPs are immobilized on NG and PI.XPS analysis probed the chemical composition of the as prepared nanocomposites that shown in Fig. S2 andS3.The XPS spectrum of NG was shown in Fig. S3a FT-IR spectra of the synthesized compounds (Fig. 5) confirm the achieved XRD results.FT-IR spectrum of Ag2CrO4, showed the strong and sharp band at 877 cm -1 that can be attributed to Cr-O stretching vibration in CrO4 2- 54.meanwhile, FT-IR spectrums of 5AN, 15AN, 35 AN and 50 AN were showed in Fig. S4 that reveals the structure of these compounds. FT-IR analysis of duplex and triplex compounds was performed to recognize the functional groups of the synthesized compounds.Fig. 5 shows FT-IR spectrum of NG shows a peaks at 1385 cm -1 that can be assigned to the vibrational mode of C-N bonds 55.Consequently this peak approves the doping of N on the graphene surface.Meanwhile, the FT-IR spectrum of PI, contains several bands at 1376, 1725, 1772, and 725 cm -1 that can be attributed to the carbonnitrogen stretching mode, asymmetric stretching, symmetrical stretching and bending modes of the imidic ring absorption peak 56.The similarity of Ag2CrO4 signal intensities in FT-IR spectrum of duplex and triplex nanocatalysts confirms the XRD results.The electronic properties of the synthesized compounds (Ag2CrO4, Ag2CrO4/PI, Ag2CrO4/NG and 25AN) were investigated using UV-vis DRS.Fig. 6 showed the UV-vis DRS of Ag2CrO4 that contains a broad signal at the range of 500-600 nm which can be attributed to Ag2CrO4.The UV-vis DRS of Ag2CrO4/PI, Ag2CrO4/NG and 25AN nanocomposites show higher intensities peculiarly in UV region.The UV-vis DRS absorption peaks are more intense than Ag2CrO4 at the 400-800 nm except that Ag2CrO4/PI is moderately decreased at the range of 450-800 nm.As expected, the absorption intensity 25AN is enhanced in the vis light.The enhanced intensity of UV-vis DRS absorption of the synthesized compounds can be assigned to two reducing agents including of grephenoxide and PI that reduces the reflection of light.Hence, it can be found that the presence of NG and PI would simplify the improvement of vis-absorbance and also facilitate the chare separation phenomena in the nanocomposites toward the light, leads to improvement of photo-assisted catalytic efficiency.Fig. 6b presents the valence band energy of the compounds that was acheived by the Kubelka-Munk formula.The band gap of PI, Ag2CrO4 and 25AN composite photocatalysts are 2.78eV, 1.72 eV, 1.08 eV, respectively.Accord with the obtained data, the combination of Ag2CrO4, NG and PI resulted in decreasing the band gap of the photocatalyst, and increasing the UV-vis DRS absorption region of Ag2CrO4. The photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra of Ag2CrO4, Ag2CrO4/PI, Ag2CrO4/NG and 25AN composites were exhibited in Fig. 7a.The characteristic peak of these photocatalysts appears at 534 nm.As shown in Fig. 7a the photoluminescence intensity directly relates to the reconstruction of EHPs.Compared with bare Ag2CrO4, the PL intensity of Ag2CrO4-based catalyst is clearly quenched, that demonstrates that the combination of NG and PI can impressively affect on the charge separation of the compounds which resulted in the enhancement of photo-assisted catalytic performance.Fig. 7b showed that the initial photocurrent density of Ag2CrO4 was 0.8Acm -2 , but its photocurrent density decayed rapidly and decreased to 0.3 Acm -2 after 500 s, which indicates that Ag2CrO4 was unstable under visible light (420nm).The photocurrent density of PI was 0.15Acm -2 , and it was still stable under visible light within 500s. The photocurrent density of 25AN composites was 2Acm -2 , which was 2.5 times that of Ag2CrO4 and far exceeded the sum of Ag2CrO4 and PI.It suggests that there was a synergistic effect between Ag2CrO4 and PI to significantly enhance the photoelectric response intensity and effectively inhibit the photo-corrosion.It was also observed that the photoluminescence intensity of 25AN (Fig. 6) was weakened due to the introduction of PI and NG to increase the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs caused by the charge transport between Ag2CrO4 and PI, thereby improving the photocatalytic performance of 25AN.EIS is a powerful tool for studying a material's electrochemical conductivity properties.The EIS Nyquist plots of the materials shown in Fig. 7c andd were measured in the frequency range of 106-0.1 Hz with amplitude of 5 mV at a bias potential of 0 V versus Ag/AgCl.The impedance of the EIS Nyquist plots is the impedance of the catalyst, catalyst/electrolyte and catalyst/catalyst interface.The lower the impedance is, the higher the efficiency of the photogenerated carrier separation and the lower the interface resistance are.The minimum interfacial impedance (50) of 25AN composite implies that the composite has better electron transport capability and higher photogenerated carrier separation efficiency than Ag2CrO4 or PI alone 57,58.From the above photoelectrochemical analysis, it can be deduced that the photocatalytic activity and stability of 25AN composite are derived from its stable and efficient photoelectric conversion property, excellent photogenerated carrier separation efficiency and electron transport capability. Raman spectroscopy as a powerful and non-destructive method has been widely applied to characterize the structure and electronic properties of carbon materials, such as NG.Fig. 8 shows typical Raman spectra of NG and 25AN.This Fig presents two intense Raman features, which are assigned to G (1581 cm -1 ) and 2D (2674 cm -1 ) peaks 59.In addition to these two peaks, NG and 25AN present a strong D peak located at 1344 cm -1 , which is activated by defects, i.e., in-plane substitution heteroatoms, vacancies, or grain boundaries/ edges 60, through an intervalley double resonance Raman process.The appearance of D peak in NG (ID/IG 1.25) and 25AN (ID/IG 1.3) indicates that there are similar numbers of defects in these two samples, due to the substitution of nitrogen dopants and the introduction of vacancies during ion bombardment.An additional peak located at 1620 cm -1 (D0 peak) is also observed for NG and 25AN, which originates from the intravalley double resonance scattering process 60.However, the D0 peak of NG is more prominent compared to that of DG; in the other words, ID/ID0 is smaller for NG with similar amount of defects.This is related to different natures of defects in NG and 25AN It is well known that the BET specific surface area is commonly considered as an important influencing factor of the photocatalytic performance of photocatalyst.Generally, photocatalytic degradation is an interfacial reaction, a large BET specific surface area can provide more adsorption sites for CO2 photoreduction due to the adsorption of CO2 on the surface of photocatalyst is usually considered as the initial step in the decomposition of CO2, so increasing the contact opportunities between CO2 and photocatalyst, finally achieving excellent CO2 photoreduction.As a consequence, in order to determine the specific surface areas of the asobtained samples, nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms were carried out.It can be found that the nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms of all the samples displayed type IV with a H3 hysteresis loops according to the Brunauer-Deming-Deming-Teller (BDDT) classification demonstrating that the asynthesized samples have mesoporous surface.Moreover, the BET specific surface area of 25AN is 63.8 m 2 /g, which is much higher than that of Ag2CrO4 (1.79 m 2 /g). The outcomes of photocatalytic performance assessments of the Ag2CrO4/NG/PI nano-composites (5AN-50AN), Ag2CrO4, Ag2CrO4/NG, Ag2CrO4/PI and NG/PI which were examined by the photoreduction of CO2 are presented in Fig. 9a.Carbon monoxide (CO), methanol (MeOH), methane (CH4), and ethanol (EtOH) were produced. Moreover, in the absence of light irradiation or diverse photocatalyst, the blank test was done which indicated that the products could be neglected.The rate of CO2 reduction was 10.0 molh -1 g cat -1 was demonstrated by pure NG. The achieved products were carbonmonoxide, methane, or methanol, and ethanol.(Actually from a theoretical point of view, other products including of hydrogen and oxygen should be observed because H2O was another reactant . It is noteworthy that the undetectability of the two products was due to two factors including the low sensitivity of the TCD detector and low concentration of them.)The diverse distribution of the achieved product using these photo assisted catalysts can mainly be ascribed to their varied conduction band positions.Due to the strong redox ability of the photogenerated electrons in NG, it can reduce CO2 to either MeOH or EtOH 62.Accordingly, no photocatalytic reduction of CO2 was acheived over the pure Ag2CrO4 catalyst.The separation efficiency of EHP and the ability of light absorption can be promoted by the deposition of Ag2CrO4 on NG leading to the enhancement of catalytic performance for photoreduction of CO2.A gradual increase in the photocatalytic activity of Ag2CrO4/NG/PI was observed with an increase of Ag2CrO4 concentration from 10 to 30 .Later on, excessive deposition of Ag2CrO4 could result in shielding of the active site on NG surfaces which subsequently leads to the catalytic efficiency reduction.Notably, the 25AN sample showed the highest rate of 68.32 molh -1 gcat -1 for CO2 reduction which was 6.8 times higher than of NG.Fig. 9a shows the comparable charts indicating photocatalytic conversion CO2 in presence of different samples.It is clearly observed that CO2 reduction has been significantly promoted from 10.0 to 68.32 molh -1 g cat -1 by doping of Ag2CrO4-NPs on NG.However, in comparison with 30AC, the photoactivity of Ag2CrO4/NG was still much lower which confirmed the superiority of the Ag2CrO4/NG/PI hetero-junction.The high photoactivity of the Ag2CrO4/NG/PI composites has been corroborated, albeit their stability in regard to practical applications was not evident.Consequently, a eight-run cycling reduction test has been performed in order to investigate about the stability of the optimal Ag2CrO4/NG/PI hybrid (25AN).Based on the results (Fig. 9b), after the decrease in the first four cycling runs, the CO2 conversion rate altered slightly indicating the stability of Ag2CrO4/NG/PI hybrids in the reaction.To gain further knowledge, the composites photoactivity under visible light irradiation (450 nm), besides their stability, was investigated.Based on the results a significant decrease up to 21.4 molh -1 gcat -1 was observed for the CO2 conversion rate of 25AN.However, in comparison with the activity of NG (10.0 molh -1 gcat -1 ), the promotion effect of Ag2CrO4 was still apparent.As previously been noticed, both the decreased light intensity and the limited absorbed light could be responsible for the reduced photoactivity under visible light 63.The effectiveness of utilizing light of shorter wavelength (255 nm) in irradiation in comparison with 350 nm for CO2 photoreduction by titanium oxide has been delineated 63.However, the low photocataltyic activity under visible light offered challenges for the promising reaction of photocatalytic CO2 reduction into fuels.Indeed, Ag2CrO4/NG/PI hybrid demonstrated great catalytic activity for RhB photodegradation.The RhB solution under visible light irradiation for 17 min could entirely be blanched in the presence of the 25AN sample, with a degradation rate of 0.24 min -1 , which was 6.3 times higher than those of NG and 3.7 times higher than those of Ag2CrO4. In general photo-assisted catalytic process have approved that two key factors including the absorption of light capacity and ability of EHPs separation improve the photocatalyst efficiency.meanwhile, in the case of the nanaocomposites such as Ag2CrO4/NG/PI high surface area is advantageous for the better performance as a photocatalyst for CO2 reduction.FE-SEM and AFM experiments has confirmed that the higher surface areas contribute to higher catalytic activities of Ag2CrO4/NG/PI nanocomposites.According to the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra, the addition of Ag2CrO4 could enhance the photoassisted catalytic function of NG, however, this could not demonstrate its high performance of photoactivity.Moreover, the photoluminescence spectra, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and photocurrent analysis, showed that the addition of Ag2CrO4 to NG could considerably increase the distance of EHPs, which, as previously reported, was based on the high photoassisted catalytic performance of Ag/graphene based nano composites 646566.The silver ions should exhibit its important role in separation of EHPs since Ag -NPs were also constructed the nanocomposite 67686970.Nevertheless, the key role of the coupling effect of Ag2CrO4 and NG has been confirmed by photocatalytic results but an subject respecting the transfer route of the photoassisted charge transfer process in the system still remained.Therefore a doubletransmission mechanism can be suggested for photocatalytic performance of the Ag2CrO4/NG/PI 646566.This mechanism indicates that the photogenerated electron in the conduction band of NG would transfer to that of Ag2CrO4, while the holes amass on the valance band of NG.Therefore, the electron and holes were properly separated.Moreover, since the electrons in the conduction band of Ag2CrO4 and holes in the valance band of NG owned adequate redutive or oxidiative ability to decompose dye molecules, such a mechanism would function for dye photodassisted-decomposition.In the current case, however, the double-transmission system could not explicate the effectivness of Ag2CrO4/NG/PI in photoassisted-catalytic function on CO2 reduction.Thus, CO2 reduction can not be promoted by the addition of Ag2CrO4 to NG if the Ag2CrO4/NG/PI nanocomposites follow the double-transmission system.Ag2CrO4/Ag 0 , can be assumed to conform with a Z-scheme photocatalytic system 71, which brought on the belief that the Z-scheme photoassisted-catalytic mechanism probably works in the Ag2CrO4 /NG/PI composite since NG and Ag2CrO4 have same conduction and valance bands positions.Moreover, the similarity of the distances between these bands has an important role to follow Z-scheme photoassisted-catalytic mechanism.Probably Ag nanoparticles function as a charge conduction bridge to create the Ag2CrO4/NG/PI Z-scheme photoassistedcatalytic mechanism.Two simultaneous events happen in this phase first the photogenerated electrons in the Notably this form of charge transfer can elevate the EHPs distance and enable the electrons and holes to stay on the conduction band of NG and valence band of Ag2CrO4, respectively.These electrons, owing to the negative ECB of NG, with their strong reducibility can simply abate CO2 to CH4, CO, MeOH, and EtOH.The obtained result is congruent with the results in Fig. 4a.Photoassisted catalytic system of Ag2CrO4/NG/PI composite is shown in Fig. 5. In order to scrutinize the most important effective compounds in the oxidative photoassisted catalytic of RhB over the Ag2CrO4/NG/PI nanocomposites, the reactive species harvesting tests have been designed.These experiments are beneficial in concluding the charge transmission path in the composite 72,73.The photoassisted-catalytic process of 25AN with diverse quenchers is exhibited in Fig. S5.Remarkably, no obvious effect for IPA or Isopropanol as an OH60-62 quencher on the degradation rate of RhB has been observed.However, the introduction of benzoquinone (BQ, O2 -scavenger) 73,74 decreased the RhB decomposition rate from 0.2 min -1 to 0.02 and EDTA (h scavenger) introduction 74,75 decreased it to 0.11 min -1 , suggesting that O2 -and h were the most important effective species in the photoassisted-catalytic processes of Ag2CrO4/NG/PI nanocomposites.Also, the reactive species harvesting tests were done using the same procedure for the samples of Ag2CrO4and NG.The results (Fig. 8d) indicated that h was the foremost effective compounds in the RhB decomposition of Ag2CrO4, which was in line with the prior published articles 75 The result is admissible by bearing in mind that the conduction band potential of Ag2CrO4is much lower than the standard reduction ability of O2 -/O2,.Similar to Ag2CrO4/NG/PI, the foremost reactive species for pure NG are O2 -and h.Undoubtedly, the conduction band of NG the electron can be improved by electrons that reduces O2 to O 2 -in Ag2CrO4/NG/PI only when the electron and holes transfer by the Zscheme mechanism.If not, accumulation of the photo-excited electron on the conduction band of Ag2CrO4 leads to the controlling effective species of h, which is incongruent with the obtained results.The provided data in Fig. 8d confirm that efficient Ag2CrO4/NG/PI nanocomposites follow the photoassisted catalytic Z-scheme system.Under these circumstances, the photoassisted catalytic EH in the hybrides are segregated properly and hence an excellent photocatalytic activity is achieved.In the current study, the great effectiveness of photoassisted catalytic Z-scheme system is demonstrated, and a promising method or the photocatalytic abatement of CO2 to fuels, also, the environmental protection of air pollution utilizing photo-assisted catalytic approach is provided."}, {"llm generation": "Ag2CrO4", "source": "It is mentioned that the XRD analysis of Ag2CrO4/PI, Ag2CrO4/NG and 25AN show the similar signals as bare Ag2CrO4, but the intensities of 25AN peaks are stronger than that of Ag2CrO4/PI and Ag2CrO4/NG.", "context": "The (211) crystal plane of Ag2CrO4 structure attributed to the diffraction peak at 231.4.It is mentioned that the XRD analysis of Ag2CrO4/PI, Ag2CrO4/NG and 25AN show the similar signals as bare Ag2CrO4, but the intensities of 25AN peaks are stronger than that of Ag2CrO4/PI and Ag2CrO4/NG.Therefore, the ternary nanocomposits is more impressive than the duplex compound to confirm the original crystal structure of Ag2CrO4 from being ruined.After decomposition the XRD pattern of the photocatalysts showed the corresponding peaks with reduced intensity, but they maintained basically unaffected, demonstrating the high resistance of the synthesized catalysts.The morphological properties of the synthesized compounds was studied by FE-SEM, TEM and AFM (Fig. 2 and3).3c andd as rippling sheets.In addition, it was clear that the Ag2CrO4 -NPs in the Ag2CrO4/PI (Fig. 3e) and Ag2CrO4/NG (Fig. 3f) are immobilized on the surfaces of PI and NG, respectively. In Fig. 2 c, it clearly observed that globular shaped Ag2CrO4 NPs are immobilized on NG and PI.XPS analysis probed the chemical composition of the as prepared nanocomposites that shown in Fig. S2 andS3.The XPS spectrum of NG was shown in Fig. S3a FT-IR spectra of the synthesized compounds (Fig. 5) confirm the achieved XRD results.FT-IR spectrum of Ag2CrO4, showed the strong and sharp band at 877 cm -1 that can be attributed to Cr-O stretching vibration in CrO4 2- 54.meanwhile, FT-IR spectrums of 5AN, 15AN, 35 AN and 50 AN were showed in Fig. S4 that reveals the structure of these compounds. FT-IR analysis of duplex and triplex compounds was performed to recognize the functional groups of the synthesized compounds.Fig. 5 shows FT-IR spectrum of NG shows a peaks at 1385 cm -1 that can be assigned to the vibrational mode of C-N bonds 55.Consequently this peak approves the doping of N on the graphene surface.Meanwhile, the FT-IR spectrum of PI, contains several bands at 1376, 1725, 1772, and 725 cm -1 that can be attributed to the carbonnitrogen stretching mode, asymmetric stretching, symmetrical stretching and bending modes of the imidic ring absorption peak 56.The similarity of Ag2CrO4 signal intensities in FT-IR spectrum of duplex and triplex nanocatalysts confirms the XRD results.The electronic properties of the synthesized compounds (Ag2CrO4, Ag2CrO4/PI, Ag2CrO4/NG and 25AN) were investigated using UV-vis DRS.Fig. 6 showed the UV-vis DRS of Ag2CrO4 that contains a broad signal at the range of 500-600 nm which can be attributed to Ag2CrO4.The UV-vis DRS of Ag2CrO4/PI, Ag2CrO4/NG and 25AN nanocomposites show higher intensities peculiarly in UV region.The UV-vis DRS absorption peaks are more intense than Ag2CrO4 at the 400-800 nm except that Ag2CrO4/PI is moderately decreased at the range of 450-800 nm.As expected, the absorption intensity 25AN is enhanced in the vis light.The enhanced intensity of UV-vis DRS absorption of the synthesized compounds can be assigned to two reducing agents including of grephenoxide and PI that reduces the reflection of light.Hence, it can be found that the presence of NG and PI would simplify the improvement of vis-absorbance and also facilitate the chare separation phenomena in the nanocomposites toward the light, leads to improvement of photo-assisted catalytic efficiency.Fig. 6b presents the valence band energy of the compounds that was acheived by the Kubelka-Munk formula.The band gap of PI, Ag2CrO4 and 25AN composite photocatalysts are 2.78eV, 1.72 eV, 1.08 eV, respectively.Accord with the obtained data, the combination of Ag2CrO4, NG and PI resulted in decreasing the band gap of the photocatalyst, and increasing the UV-vis DRS absorption region of Ag2CrO4. The photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra of Ag2CrO4, Ag2CrO4/PI, Ag2CrO4/NG and 25AN composites were exhibited in Fig. 7a.The characteristic peak of these photocatalysts appears at 534 nm.As shown in Fig. 7a the photoluminescence intensity directly relates to the reconstruction of EHPs.Compared with bare Ag2CrO4, the PL intensity of Ag2CrO4-based catalyst is clearly quenched, that demonstrates that the combination of NG and PI can impressively affect on the charge separation of the compounds which resulted in the enhancement of photo-assisted catalytic performance.Fig. 7b showed that the initial photocurrent density of Ag2CrO4 was 0.8Acm -2 , but its photocurrent density decayed rapidly and decreased to 0.3 Acm -2 after 500 s, which indicates that Ag2CrO4 was unstable under visible light (420nm).The photocurrent density of PI was 0.15Acm -2 , and it was still stable under visible light within 500s. The photocurrent density of 25AN composites was 2Acm -2 , which was 2.5 times that of Ag2CrO4 and far exceeded the sum of Ag2CrO4 and PI.It suggests that there was a synergistic effect between Ag2CrO4 and PI to significantly enhance the photoelectric response intensity and effectively inhibit the photo-corrosion.It was also observed that the photoluminescence intensity of 25AN (Fig. 6) was weakened due to the introduction of PI and NG to increase the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs caused by the charge transport between Ag2CrO4 and PI, thereby improving the photocatalytic performance of 25AN.EIS is a powerful tool for studying a material's electrochemical conductivity properties.The EIS Nyquist plots of the materials shown in Fig. 7c andd were measured in the frequency range of 106-0.1 Hz with amplitude of 5 mV at a bias potential of 0 V versus Ag/AgCl.The impedance of the EIS Nyquist plots is the impedance of the catalyst, catalyst/electrolyte and catalyst/catalyst interface.The lower the impedance is, the higher the efficiency of the photogenerated carrier separation and the lower the interface resistance are.The minimum interfacial impedance (50) of 25AN composite implies that the composite has better electron transport capability and higher photogenerated carrier separation efficiency than Ag2CrO4 or PI alone 57,58.From the above photoelectrochemical analysis, it can be deduced that the photocatalytic activity and stability of 25AN composite are derived from its stable and efficient photoelectric conversion property, excellent photogenerated carrier separation efficiency and electron transport capability. Raman spectroscopy as a powerful and non-destructive method has been widely applied to characterize the structure and electronic properties of carbon materials, such as NG.Fig. 8 shows typical Raman spectra of NG and 25AN.This Fig presents two intense Raman features, which are assigned to G (1581 cm -1 ) and 2D (2674 cm -1 ) peaks 59.In addition to these two peaks, NG and 25AN present a strong D peak located at 1344 cm -1 , which is activated by defects, i.e., in-plane substitution heteroatoms, vacancies, or grain boundaries/ edges 60, through an intervalley double resonance Raman process.The appearance of D peak in NG (ID/IG 1.25) and 25AN (ID/IG 1.3) indicates that there are similar numbers of defects in these two samples, due to the substitution of nitrogen dopants and the introduction of vacancies during ion bombardment.An additional peak located at 1620 cm -1 (D0 peak) is also observed for NG and 25AN, which originates from the intravalley double resonance scattering process 60.However, the D0 peak of NG is more prominent compared to that of DG; in the other words, ID/ID0 is smaller for NG with similar amount of defects.This is related to different natures of defects in NG and 25AN It is well known that the BET specific surface area is commonly considered as an important influencing factor of the photocatalytic performance of photocatalyst.Generally, photocatalytic degradation is an interfacial reaction, a large BET specific surface area can provide more adsorption sites for CO2 photoreduction due to the adsorption of CO2 on the surface of photocatalyst is usually considered as the initial step in the decomposition of CO2, so increasing the contact opportunities between CO2 and photocatalyst, finally achieving excellent CO2 photoreduction.As a consequence, in order to determine the specific surface areas of the asobtained samples, nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms were carried out.It can be found that the nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms of all the samples displayed type IV with a H3 hysteresis loops according to the Brunauer-Deming-Deming-Teller (BDDT) classification demonstrating that the asynthesized samples have mesoporous surface.Moreover, the BET specific surface area of 25AN is 63.8 m 2 /g, which is much higher than that of Ag2CrO4 (1.79 m 2 /g). The outcomes of photocatalytic performance assessments of the Ag2CrO4/NG/PI nano-composites (5AN-50AN), Ag2CrO4, Ag2CrO4/NG, Ag2CrO4/PI and NG/PI which were examined by the photoreduction of CO2 are presented in Fig. 9a.Carbon monoxide (CO), methanol (MeOH), methane (CH4), and ethanol (EtOH) were produced. Moreover, in the absence of light irradiation or diverse photocatalyst, the blank test was done which indicated that the products could be neglected.The rate of CO2 reduction was 10.0 molh -1 g cat -1 was demonstrated by pure NG. The achieved products were carbonmonoxide, methane, or methanol, and ethanol.(Actually from a theoretical point of view, other products including of hydrogen and oxygen should be observed because H2O was another reactant . It is noteworthy that the undetectability of the two products was due to two factors including the low sensitivity of the TCD detector and low concentration of them.)The diverse distribution of the achieved product using these photo assisted catalysts can mainly be ascribed to their varied conduction band positions.Due to the strong redox ability of the photogenerated electrons in NG, it can reduce CO2 to either MeOH or EtOH 62.Accordingly, no photocatalytic reduction of CO2 was acheived over the pure Ag2CrO4 catalyst.The separation efficiency of EHP and the ability of light absorption can be promoted by the deposition of Ag2CrO4 on NG leading to the enhancement of catalytic performance for photoreduction of CO2.A gradual increase in the photocatalytic activity of Ag2CrO4/NG/PI was observed with an increase of Ag2CrO4 concentration from 10 to 30 .Later on, excessive deposition of Ag2CrO4 could result in shielding of the active site on NG surfaces which subsequently leads to the catalytic efficiency reduction.Notably, the 25AN sample showed the highest rate of 68.32 molh -1 gcat -1 for CO2 reduction which was 6.8 times higher than of NG.Fig. 9a shows the comparable charts indicating photocatalytic conversion CO2 in presence of different samples.It is clearly observed that CO2 reduction has been significantly promoted from 10.0 to 68.32 molh -1 g cat -1 by doping of Ag2CrO4-NPs on NG.However, in comparison with 30AC, the photoactivity of Ag2CrO4/NG was still much lower which confirmed the superiority of the Ag2CrO4/NG/PI hetero-junction.The high photoactivity of the Ag2CrO4/NG/PI composites has been corroborated, albeit their stability in regard to practical applications was not evident.Consequently, a eight-run cycling reduction test has been performed in order to investigate about the stability of the optimal Ag2CrO4/NG/PI hybrid (25AN).Based on the results (Fig. 9b), after the decrease in the first four cycling runs, the CO2 conversion rate altered slightly indicating the stability of Ag2CrO4/NG/PI hybrids in the reaction.To gain further knowledge, the composites photoactivity under visible light irradiation (450 nm), besides their stability, was investigated.Based on the results a significant decrease up to 21.4 molh -1 gcat -1 was observed for the CO2 conversion rate of 25AN.However, in comparison with the activity of NG (10.0 molh -1 gcat -1 ), the promotion effect of Ag2CrO4 was still apparent.As previously been noticed, both the decreased light intensity and the limited absorbed light could be responsible for the reduced photoactivity under visible light 63.The effectiveness of utilizing light of shorter wavelength (255 nm) in irradiation in comparison with 350 nm for CO2 photoreduction by titanium oxide has been delineated 63.However, the low photocataltyic activity under visible light offered challenges for the promising reaction of photocatalytic CO2 reduction into fuels.Indeed, Ag2CrO4/NG/PI hybrid demonstrated great catalytic activity for RhB photodegradation.The RhB solution under visible light irradiation for 17 min could entirely be blanched in the presence of the 25AN sample, with a degradation rate of 0.24 min -1 , which was 6.3 times higher than those of NG and 3.7 times higher than those of Ag2CrO4. In general photo-assisted catalytic process have approved that two key factors including the absorption of light capacity and ability of EHPs separation improve the photocatalyst efficiency.meanwhile, in the case of the nanaocomposites such as Ag2CrO4/NG/PI high surface area is advantageous for the better performance as a photocatalyst for CO2 reduction.FE-SEM and AFM experiments has confirmed that the higher surface areas contribute to higher catalytic activities of Ag2CrO4/NG/PI nanocomposites.According to the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra, the addition of Ag2CrO4 could enhance the photoassisted catalytic function of NG, however, this could not demonstrate its high performance of photoactivity.Moreover, the photoluminescence spectra, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and photocurrent analysis, showed that the addition of Ag2CrO4 to NG could considerably increase the distance of EHPs, which, as previously reported, was based on the high photoassisted catalytic performance of Ag/graphene based nano composites 646566.The silver ions should exhibit its important role in separation of EHPs since Ag -NPs were also constructed the nanocomposite 67686970.Nevertheless, the key role of the coupling effect of Ag2CrO4 and NG has been confirmed by photocatalytic results but an subject respecting the transfer route of the photoassisted charge transfer process in the system still remained.Therefore a doubletransmission mechanism can be suggested for photocatalytic performance of the Ag2CrO4/NG/PI 646566.This mechanism indicates that the photogenerated electron in the conduction band of NG would transfer to that of Ag2CrO4, while the holes amass on the valance band of NG.Therefore, the electron and holes were properly separated.Moreover, since the electrons in the conduction band of Ag2CrO4 and holes in the valance band of NG owned adequate redutive or oxidiative ability to decompose dye molecules, such a mechanism would function for dye photodassisted-decomposition.In the current case, however, the double-transmission system could not explicate the effectivness of Ag2CrO4/NG/PI in photoassisted-catalytic function on CO2 reduction.Thus, CO2 reduction can not be promoted by the addition of Ag2CrO4 to NG if the Ag2CrO4/NG/PI nanocomposites follow the double-transmission system.Ag2CrO4/Ag 0 , can be assumed to conform with a Z-scheme photocatalytic system 71, which brought on the belief that the Z-scheme photoassisted-catalytic mechanism probably works in the Ag2CrO4 /NG/PI composite since NG and Ag2CrO4 have same conduction and valance bands positions.Moreover, the similarity of the distances between these bands has an important role to follow Z-scheme photoassisted-catalytic mechanism.Probably Ag nanoparticles function as a charge conduction bridge to create the Ag2CrO4/NG/PI Z-scheme photoassistedcatalytic mechanism.Two simultaneous events happen in this phase first the photogenerated electrons in the Notably this form of charge transfer can elevate the EHPs distance and enable the electrons and holes to stay on the conduction band of NG and valence band of Ag2CrO4, respectively.These electrons, owing to the negative ECB of NG, with their strong reducibility can simply abate CO2 to CH4, CO, MeOH, and EtOH.The obtained result is congruent with the results in Fig. 4a.Photoassisted catalytic system of Ag2CrO4/NG/PI composite is shown in Fig. 5. In order to scrutinize the most important effective compounds in the oxidative photoassisted catalytic of RhB over the Ag2CrO4/NG/PI nanocomposites, the reactive species harvesting tests have been designed.These experiments are beneficial in concluding the charge transmission path in the composite 72,73.The photoassisted-catalytic process of 25AN with diverse quenchers is exhibited in Fig. S5.Remarkably, no obvious effect for IPA or Isopropanol as an OH60-62 quencher on the degradation rate of RhB has been observed.However, the introduction of benzoquinone (BQ, O2 -scavenger) 73,74 decreased the RhB decomposition rate from 0.2 min -1 to 0.02 and EDTA (h scavenger) introduction 74,75 decreased it to 0.11 min -1 , suggesting that O2 -and h were the most important effective species in the photoassisted-catalytic processes of Ag2CrO4/NG/PI nanocomposites.Also, the reactive species harvesting tests were done using the same procedure for the samples of Ag2CrO4and NG.The results (Fig. 8d) indicated that h was the foremost effective compounds in the RhB decomposition of Ag2CrO4, which was in line with the prior published articles 75 The result is admissible by bearing in mind that the conduction band potential of Ag2CrO4is much lower than the standard reduction ability of O2 -/O2,.Similar to Ag2CrO4/NG/PI, the foremost reactive species for pure NG are O2 -and h.Undoubtedly, the conduction band of NG the electron can be improved by electrons that reduces O2 to O 2 -in Ag2CrO4/NG/PI only when the electron and holes transfer by the Zscheme mechanism.If not, accumulation of the photo-excited electron on the conduction band of Ag2CrO4 leads to the controlling effective species of h, which is incongruent with the obtained results.The provided data in Fig. 8d confirm that efficient Ag2CrO4/NG/PI nanocomposites follow the photoassisted catalytic Z-scheme system.Under these circumstances, the photoassisted catalytic EH in the hybrides are segregated properly and hence an excellent photocatalytic activity is achieved.In the current study, the great effectiveness of photoassisted catalytic Z-scheme system is demonstrated, and a promising method or the photocatalytic abatement of CO2 to fuels, also, the environmental protection of air pollution utilizing photo-assisted catalytic approach is provided."}, {"llm generation": "PI", "source": "The band gap of PI, Ag2CrO4 and 25AN composite photocatalysts are 2.78eV, 1.72 eV, 1.08 eV, respectively.", "context": "The (211) crystal plane of Ag2CrO4 structure attributed to the diffraction peak at 231.4.It is mentioned that the XRD analysis of Ag2CrO4/PI, Ag2CrO4/NG and 25AN show the similar signals as bare Ag2CrO4, but the intensities of 25AN peaks are stronger than that of Ag2CrO4/PI and Ag2CrO4/NG.Therefore, the ternary nanocomposits is more impressive than the duplex compound to confirm the original crystal structure of Ag2CrO4 from being ruined.After decomposition the XRD pattern of the photocatalysts showed the corresponding peaks with reduced intensity, but they maintained basically unaffected, demonstrating the high resistance of the synthesized catalysts.The morphological properties of the synthesized compounds was studied by FE-SEM, TEM and AFM (Fig. 2 and3).3c andd as rippling sheets.In addition, it was clear that the Ag2CrO4 -NPs in the Ag2CrO4/PI (Fig. 3e) and Ag2CrO4/NG (Fig. 3f) are immobilized on the surfaces of PI and NG, respectively.

The photocurrent density of 25AN composites was 2Acm -2 , which was 2.5 times that of Ag2CrO4 and far exceeded the sum of Ag2CrO4 and PI.It suggests that there was a synergistic effect between Ag2CrO4 and PI to significantly enhance the photoelectric response intensity and effectively inhibit the photo-corrosion.It was also observed that the photoluminescence intensity of 25AN (Fig. 6) was weakened due to the introduction of PI and NG to increase the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs caused by the charge transport between Ag2CrO4 and PI, thereby improving the photocatalytic performance of 25AN.EIS is a powerful tool for studying a material's electrochemical conductivity properties.The EIS Nyquist plots of the materials shown in Fig. 7c andd were measured in the frequency range of 106-0.1 Hz with amplitude of 5 mV at a bias potential of 0 V versus Ag/AgCl.The impedance of the EIS Nyquist plots is the impedance of the catalyst, catalyst/electrolyte and catalyst/catalyst interface.The lower the impedance is, the higher the efficiency of the photogenerated carrier separation and the lower the interface resistance are.The minimum interfacial impedance (50) of 25AN composite implies that the composite has better electron transport capability and higher photogenerated carrier separation efficiency than Ag2CrO4 or PI alone 57,58.From the above photoelectrochemical analysis, it can be deduced that the photocatalytic activity and stability of 25AN composite are derived from its stable and efficient photoelectric conversion property, excellent photogenerated carrier separation efficiency and electron transport capability. Raman spectroscopy as a powerful and non-destructive method has been widely applied to characterize the structure and electronic properties of carbon materials, such as NG.Fig. 8 shows typical Raman spectra of NG and 25AN.This Fig presents two intense Raman features, which are assigned to G (1581 cm -1 ) and 2D (2674 cm -1 ) peaks 59.In addition to these two peaks, NG and 25AN present a strong D peak located at 1344 cm -1 , which is activated by defects, i.e., in-plane substitution heteroatoms, vacancies, or grain boundaries/ edges 60, through an intervalley double resonance Raman process.The appearance of D peak in NG (ID/IG 1.25) and 25AN (ID/IG 1.3) indicates that there are similar numbers of defects in these two samples, due to the substitution of nitrogen dopants and the introduction of vacancies during ion bombardment.An additional peak located at 1620 cm -1 (D0 peak) is also observed for NG and 25AN, which originates from the intravalley double resonance scattering process 60.However, the D0 peak of NG is more prominent compared to that of DG; in the other words, ID/ID0 is smaller for NG with similar amount of defects.This is related to different natures of defects in NG and 25AN It is well known that the BET specific surface area is commonly considered as an important influencing factor of the photocatalytic performance of photocatalyst.Generally, photocatalytic degradation is an interfacial reaction, a large BET specific surface area can provide more adsorption sites for CO2 photoreduction due to the adsorption of CO2 on the surface of photocatalyst is usually considered as the initial step in the decomposition of CO2, so increasing the contact opportunities between CO2 and photocatalyst, finally achieving excellent CO2 photoreduction.As a consequence, in order to determine the specific surface areas of the asobtained samples, nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms were carried out.It can be found that the nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms of all the samples displayed type IV with a H3 hysteresis loops according to the Brunauer-Deming-Deming-Teller (BDDT) classification demonstrating that the asynthesized samples have mesoporous surface.Moreover, the BET specific surface area of 25AN is 63.8 m 2 /g, which is much higher than that of Ag2CrO4 (1.79 m 2 /g). The outcomes of photocatalytic performance assessments of the Ag2CrO4/NG/PI nano-composites (5AN-50AN), Ag2CrO4, Ag2CrO4/NG, Ag2CrO4/PI and NG/PI which were examined by the photoreduction of CO2 are presented in Fig. 9a.Carbon monoxide (CO), methanol (MeOH), methane (CH4), and ethanol (EtOH) were produced. Moreover, in the absence of light irradiation or diverse photocatalyst, the blank test was done which indicated that the products could be neglected.The rate of CO2 reduction was 10.0 molh -1 g cat -1 was demonstrated by pure NG. The achieved products were carbonmonoxide, methane, or methanol, and ethanol.(Actually from a theoretical point of view, other products including of hydrogen and oxygen should be observed because H2O was another reactant . It is noteworthy that the undetectability of the two products was due to two factors including the low sensitivity of the TCD detector and low concentration of them.)The diverse distribution of the achieved product using these photo assisted catalysts can mainly be ascribed to their varied conduction band positions.Due to the strong redox ability of the photogenerated electrons in NG, it can reduce CO2 to either MeOH or EtOH 62.Accordingly, no photocatalytic reduction of CO2 was acheived over the pure Ag2CrO4 catalyst.The separation efficiency of EHP and the ability of light absorption can be promoted by the deposition of Ag2CrO4 on NG leading to the enhancement of catalytic performance for photoreduction of CO2.A gradual increase in the photocatalytic activity of Ag2CrO4/NG/PI was observed with an increase of Ag2CrO4 concentration from 10 to 30 .Later on, excessive deposition of Ag2CrO4 could result in shielding of the active site on NG surfaces which subsequently leads to the catalytic efficiency reduction.Notably, the 25AN sample showed the highest rate of 68.32 molh -1 gcat -1 for CO2 reduction which was 6.8 times higher than of NG.Fig. 9a shows the comparable charts indicating photocatalytic conversion CO2 in presence of different samples.It is clearly observed that CO2 reduction has been significantly promoted from 10.0 to 68.32 molh -1 g cat -1 by doping of Ag2CrO4-NPs on NG.However, in comparison with 30AC, the photoactivity of Ag2CrO4/NG was still much lower which confirmed the superiority of the Ag2CrO4/NG/PI hetero-junction.The high photoactivity of the Ag2CrO4/NG/PI composites has been corroborated, albeit their stability in regard to practical applications was not evident.Consequently, a eight-run cycling reduction test has been performed in order to investigate about the stability of the optimal Ag2CrO4/NG/PI hybrid (25AN).Based on the results (Fig. 9b), after the decrease in the first four cycling runs, the CO2 conversion rate altered slightly indicating the stability of Ag2CrO4/NG/PI hybrids in the reaction.To gain further knowledge, the composites photoactivity under visible light irradiation (450 nm), besides their stability, was investigated.Based on the results a significant decrease up to 21.4 molh -1 gcat -1 was observed for the CO2 conversion rate of 25AN.However, in comparison with the activity of NG (10.0 molh -1 gcat -1 ), the promotion effect of Ag2CrO4 was still apparent.As previously been noticed, both the decreased light intensity and the limited absorbed light could be responsible for the reduced photoactivity under visible light 63.The effectiveness of utilizing light of shorter wavelength (255 nm) in irradiation in comparison with 350 nm for CO2 photoreduction by titanium oxide has been delineated 63.However, the low photocataltyic activity under visible light offered challenges for the promising reaction of photocatalytic CO2 reduction into fuels.Indeed, Ag2CrO4/NG/PI hybrid demonstrated great catalytic activity for RhB photodegradation.The RhB solution under visible light irradiation for 17 min could entirely be blanched in the presence of the 25AN sample, with a degradation rate of 0.24 min -1 , which was 6.3 times higher than those of NG and 3.7 times higher than those of Ag2CrO4. In general photo-assisted catalytic process have approved that two key factors including the absorption of light capacity and ability of EHPs separation improve the photocatalyst efficiency.meanwhile, in the case of the nanaocomposites such as Ag2CrO4/NG/PI high surface area is advantageous for the better performance as a photocatalyst for CO2 reduction.FE-SEM and AFM experiments has confirmed that the higher surface areas contribute to higher catalytic activities of Ag2CrO4/NG/PI nanocomposites.According to the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra, the addition of Ag2CrO4 could enhance the photoassisted catalytic function of NG, however, this could not demonstrate its high performance of photoactivity.Moreover, the photoluminescence spectra, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and photocurrent analysis, showed that the addition of Ag2CrO4 to NG could considerably increase the distance of EHPs, which, as previously reported, was based on the high photoassisted catalytic performance of Ag/graphene based nano composites 646566.The silver ions should exhibit its important role in separation of EHPs since Ag -NPs were also constructed the nanocomposite 67686970.Nevertheless, the key role of the coupling effect of Ag2CrO4 and NG has been confirmed by photocatalytic results but an subject respecting the transfer route of the photoassisted charge transfer process in the system still remained.Therefore a doubletransmission mechanism can be suggested for photocatalytic performance of the Ag2CrO4/NG/PI 646566.This mechanism indicates that the photogenerated electron in the conduction band of NG would transfer to that of Ag2CrO4, while the holes amass on the valance band of NG.Therefore, the electron and holes were properly separated.Moreover, since the electrons in the conduction band of Ag2CrO4 and holes in the valance band of NG owned adequate redutive or oxidiative ability to decompose dye molecules, such a mechanism would function for dye photodassisted-decomposition.In the current case, however, the double-transmission system could not explicate the effectivness of Ag2CrO4/NG/PI in photoassisted-catalytic function on CO2 reduction.Thus, CO2 reduction can not be promoted by the addition of Ag2CrO4 to NG if the Ag2CrO4/NG/PI nanocomposites follow the double-transmission system.Ag2CrO4/Ag 0 , can be assumed to conform with a Z-scheme photocatalytic system 71, which brought on the belief that the Z-scheme photoassisted-catalytic mechanism probably works in the Ag2CrO4 /NG/PI composite since NG and Ag2CrO4 have same conduction and valance bands positions.Moreover, the similarity of the distances between these bands has an important role to follow Z-scheme photoassisted-catalytic mechanism.Probably Ag nanoparticles function as a charge conduction bridge to create the Ag2CrO4/NG/PI Z-scheme photoassistedcatalytic mechanism.Two simultaneous events happen in this phase first the photogenerated electrons in the Notably this form of charge transfer can elevate the EHPs distance and enable the electrons and holes to stay on the conduction band of NG and valence band of Ag2CrO4, respectively.These electrons, owing to the negative ECB of NG, with their strong reducibility can simply abate CO2 to CH4, CO, MeOH, and EtOH.The obtained result is congruent with the results in Fig. 4a.Photoassisted catalytic system of Ag2CrO4/NG/PI composite is shown in Fig. 5. In order to scrutinize the most important effective compounds in the oxidative photoassisted catalytic of RhB over the Ag2CrO4/NG/PI nanocomposites, the reactive species harvesting tests have been designed.These experiments are beneficial in concluding the charge transmission path in the composite 72,73.The photoassisted-catalytic process of 25AN with diverse quenchers is exhibited in Fig. S5.Remarkably, no obvious effect for IPA or Isopropanol as an OH60-62 quencher on the degradation rate of RhB has been observed.However, the introduction of benzoquinone (BQ, O2 -scavenger) 73,74 decreased the RhB decomposition rate from 0.2 min -1 to 0.02 and EDTA (h scavenger) introduction 74,75 decreased it to 0.11 min -1 , suggesting that O2 -and h were the most important effective species in the photoassisted-catalytic processes of Ag2CrO4/NG/PI nanocomposites.Also, the reactive species harvesting tests were done using the same procedure for the samples of Ag2CrO4and NG.The results (Fig. 8d) indicated that h was the foremost effective compounds in the RhB decomposition of Ag2CrO4, which was in line with the prior published articles 75 The result is admissible by bearing in mind that the conduction band potential of Ag2CrO4is much lower than the standard reduction ability of O2 -/O2,.Similar to Ag2CrO4/NG/PI, the foremost reactive species for pure NG are O2 -and h.Undoubtedly, the conduction band of NG the electron can be improved by electrons that reduces O2 to O 2 -in Ag2CrO4/NG/PI only when the electron and holes transfer by the Zscheme mechanism.If not, accumulation of the photo-excited electron on the conduction band of Ag2CrO4 leads to the controlling effective species of h, which is incongruent with the obtained results.The provided data in Fig. 8d confirm that efficient Ag2CrO4/NG/PI nanocomposites follow the photoassisted catalytic Z-scheme system.Under these circumstances, the photoassisted catalytic EH in the hybrides are segregated properly and hence an excellent photocatalytic activity is achieved.In the current study, the great effectiveness of photoassisted catalytic Z-scheme system is demonstrated, and a promising method or the photocatalytic abatement of CO2 to fuels, also, the environmental protection of air pollution utilizing photo-assisted catalytic approach is provided."}, {"llm generation": "Ag2CrO4/NG/PI", "source": "The outcomes of photocatalytic performance assessments of the Ag2CrO4/NG/PI nano-composites (5AN-50AN), Ag2CrO4, Ag2CrO4/NG, Ag2CrO4/PI and NG/PI which were examined by the photoreduction of CO2 are presented in Fig. 9a.", "context": "The (211) crystal plane of Ag2CrO4 structure attributed to the diffraction peak at 231.4.It is mentioned that the XRD analysis of Ag2CrO4/PI, Ag2CrO4/NG and 25AN show the similar signals as bare Ag2CrO4, but the intensities of 25AN peaks are stronger than that of Ag2CrO4/PI and Ag2CrO4/NG.Therefore, the ternary nanocomposits is more impressive than the duplex compound to confirm the original crystal structure of Ag2CrO4 from being ruined.After decomposition the XRD pattern of the photocatalysts showed the corresponding peaks with reduced intensity, but they maintained basically unaffected, demonstrating the high resistance of the synthesized catalysts.The morphological properties of the synthesized compounds was studied by FE-SEM, TEM and AFM (Fig. 2 and3).3c andd as rippling sheets.In addition, it was clear that the Ag2CrO4 -NPs in the Ag2CrO4/PI (Fig. 3e) and Ag2CrO4/NG (Fig. 3f) are immobilized on the surfaces of PI and NG, respectively. In Fig. 2 c, it clearly observed that globular shaped Ag2CrO4 NPs are immobilized on NG and PI.XPS analysis probed the chemical composition of the as prepared nanocomposites that shown in Fig. S2 andS3.The XPS spectrum of NG was shown in Fig. S3a FT-IR spectra of the synthesized compounds (Fig. 5) confirm the achieved XRD results.FT-IR spectrum of Ag2CrO4, showed the strong and sharp band at 877 cm -1 that can be attributed to Cr-O stretching vibration in CrO4 2- 54.meanwhile, FT-IR spectrums of 5AN, 15AN, 35 AN and 50 AN were showed in Fig. S4 that reveals the structure of these compounds. FT-IR analysis of duplex and triplex compounds was performed to recognize the functional groups of the synthesized compounds.Fig. 5 shows FT-IR spectrum of NG shows a peaks at 1385 cm -1 that can be assigned to the vibrational mode of C-N bonds 55.Consequently this peak approves the doping of N on the graphene surface.Meanwhile, the FT-IR spectrum of PI, contains several bands at 1376, 1725, 1772, and 725 cm -1 that can be attributed to the carbonnitrogen stretching mode, asymmetric stretching, symmetrical stretching and bending modes of the imidic ring absorption peak 56.The similarity of Ag2CrO4 signal intensities in FT-IR spectrum of duplex and triplex nanocatalysts confirms the XRD results.The electronic properties of the synthesized compounds (Ag2CrO4, Ag2CrO4/PI, Ag2CrO4/NG and 25AN) were investigated using UV-vis DRS.Fig. 6 showed the UV-vis DRS of Ag2CrO4 that contains a broad signal at the range of 500-600 nm which can be attributed to Ag2CrO4.The UV-vis DRS of Ag2CrO4/PI, Ag2CrO4/NG and 25AN nanocomposites show higher intensities peculiarly in UV region.The UV-vis DRS absorption peaks are more intense than Ag2CrO4 at the 400-800 nm except that Ag2CrO4/PI is moderately decreased at the range of 450-800 nm.As expected, the absorption intensity 25AN is enhanced in the vis light.The enhanced intensity of UV-vis DRS absorption of the synthesized compounds can be assigned to two reducing agents including of grephenoxide and PI that reduces the reflection of light.Hence, it can be found that the presence of NG and PI would simplify the improvement of vis-absorbance and also facilitate the chare separation phenomena in the nanocomposites toward the light, leads to improvement of photo-assisted catalytic efficiency.Fig. 6b presents the valence band energy of the compounds that was acheived by the Kubelka-Munk formula.The band gap of PI, Ag2CrO4 and 25AN composite photocatalysts are 2.78eV, 1.72 eV, 1.08 eV, respectively.Accord with the obtained data, the combination of Ag2CrO4, NG and PI resulted in decreasing the band gap of the photocatalyst, and increasing the UV-vis DRS absorption region of Ag2CrO4. The photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra of Ag2CrO4, Ag2CrO4/PI, Ag2CrO4/NG and 25AN composites were exhibited in Fig. 7a.The characteristic peak of these photocatalysts appears at 534 nm.As shown in Fig. 7a the photoluminescence intensity directly relates to the reconstruction of EHPs.Compared with bare Ag2CrO4, the PL intensity of Ag2CrO4-based catalyst is clearly quenched, that demonstrates that the combination of NG and PI can impressively affect on the charge separation of the compounds which resulted in the enhancement of photo-assisted catalytic performance.Fig. 7b showed that the initial photocurrent density of Ag2CrO4 was 0.8Acm -2 , but its photocurrent density decayed rapidly and decreased to 0.3 Acm -2 after 500 s, which indicates that Ag2CrO4 was unstable under visible light (420nm).The photocurrent density of PI was 0.15Acm -2 , and it was still stable under visible light within 500s. The photocurrent density of 25AN composites was 2Acm -2 , which was 2.5 times that of Ag2CrO4 and far exceeded the sum of Ag2CrO4 and PI.It suggests that there was a synergistic effect between Ag2CrO4 and PI to significantly enhance the photoelectric response intensity and effectively inhibit the photo-corrosion.It was also observed that the photoluminescence intensity of 25AN (Fig. 6) was weakened due to the introduction of PI and NG to increase the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs caused by the charge transport between Ag2CrO4 and PI, thereby improving the photocatalytic performance of 25AN.EIS is a powerful tool for studying a material's electrochemical conductivity properties.The EIS Nyquist plots of the materials shown in Fig. 7c andd were measured in the frequency range of 106-0.1 Hz with amplitude of 5 mV at a bias potential of 0 V versus Ag/AgCl.The impedance of the EIS Nyquist plots is the impedance of the catalyst, catalyst/electrolyte and catalyst/catalyst interface.The lower the impedance is, the higher the efficiency of the photogenerated carrier separation and the lower the interface resistance are.The minimum interfacial impedance (50) of 25AN composite implies that the composite has better electron transport capability and higher photogenerated carrier separation efficiency than Ag2CrO4 or PI alone 57,58.From the above photoelectrochemical analysis, it can be deduced that the photocatalytic activity and stability of 25AN composite are derived from its stable and efficient photoelectric conversion property, excellent photogenerated carrier separation efficiency and electron transport capability. Raman spectroscopy as a powerful and non-destructive method has been widely applied to characterize the structure and electronic properties of carbon materials, such as NG.Fig. 8 shows typical Raman spectra of NG and 25AN.This Fig presents two intense Raman features, which are assigned to G (1581 cm -1 ) and 2D (2674 cm -1 ) peaks 59.In addition to these two peaks, NG and 25AN present a strong D peak located at 1344 cm -1 , which is activated by defects, i.e., in-plane substitution heteroatoms, vacancies, or grain boundaries/ edges 60, through an intervalley double resonance Raman process.The appearance of D peak in NG (ID/IG 1.25) and 25AN (ID/IG 1.3) indicates that there are similar numbers of defects in these two samples, due to the substitution of nitrogen dopants and the introduction of vacancies during ion bombardment.An additional peak located at 1620 cm -1 (D0 peak) is also observed for NG and 25AN, which originates from the intravalley double resonance scattering process 60.However, the D0 peak of NG is more prominent compared to that of DG; in the other words, ID/ID0 is smaller for NG with similar amount of defects.This is related to different natures of defects in NG and 25AN It is well known that the BET specific surface area is commonly considered as an important influencing factor of the photocatalytic performance of photocatalyst.Generally, photocatalytic degradation is an interfacial reaction, a large BET specific surface area can provide more adsorption sites for CO2 photoreduction due to the adsorption of CO2 on the surface of photocatalyst is usually considered as the initial step in the decomposition of CO2, so increasing the contact opportunities between CO2 and photocatalyst, finally achieving excellent CO2 photoreduction.As a consequence, in order to determine the specific surface areas of the asobtained samples, nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms were carried out.It can be found that the nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms of all the samples displayed type IV with a H3 hysteresis loops according to the Brunauer-Deming-Deming-Teller (BDDT) classification demonstrating that the asynthesized samples have mesoporous surface.Moreover, the BET specific surface area of 25AN is 63.8 m 2 /g, which is much higher than that of Ag2CrO4 (1.79 m 2 /g). The outcomes of photocatalytic performance assessments of the Ag2CrO4/NG/PI nano-composites (5AN-50AN), Ag2CrO4, Ag2CrO4/NG, Ag2CrO4/PI and NG/PI which were examined by the photoreduction of CO2 are presented in Fig. 9a.Carbon monoxide (CO), methanol (MeOH), methane (CH4), and ethanol (EtOH) were produced. Moreover, in the absence of light irradiation or diverse photocatalyst, the blank test was done which indicated that the products could be neglected.The rate of CO2 reduction was 10.0 molh -1 g cat -1 was demonstrated by pure NG. The achieved products were carbonmonoxide, methane, or methanol, and ethanol.(Actually from a theoretical point of view, other products including of hydrogen and oxygen should be observed because H2O was another reactant . It is noteworthy that the undetectability of the two products was due to two factors including the low sensitivity of the TCD detector and low concentration of them.)The diverse distribution of the achieved product using these photo assisted catalysts can mainly be ascribed to their varied conduction band positions.Due to the strong redox ability of the photogenerated electrons in NG, it can reduce CO2 to either MeOH or EtOH 62.Accordingly, no photocatalytic reduction of CO2 was acheived over the pure Ag2CrO4 catalyst.The separation efficiency of EHP and the ability of light absorption can be promoted by the deposition of Ag2CrO4 on NG leading to the enhancement of catalytic performance for photoreduction of CO2.A gradual increase in the photocatalytic activity of Ag2CrO4/NG/PI was observed with an increase of Ag2CrO4 concentration from 10 to 30 .Later on, excessive deposition of Ag2CrO4 could result in shielding of the active site on NG surfaces which subsequently leads to the catalytic efficiency reduction.Notably, the 25AN sample showed the highest rate of 68.32 molh -1 gcat -1 for CO2 reduction which was 6.8 times higher than of NG.Fig. 9a shows the comparable charts indicating photocatalytic conversion CO2 in presence of different samples.It is clearly observed that CO2 reduction has been significantly promoted from 10.0 to 68.32 molh -1 g cat -1 by doping of Ag2CrO4-NPs on NG.However, in comparison with 30AC, the photoactivity of Ag2CrO4/NG was still much lower which confirmed the superiority of the Ag2CrO4/NG/PI hetero-junction.The high photoactivity of the Ag2CrO4/NG/PI composites has been corroborated, albeit their stability in regard to practical applications was not evident.Consequently, a eight-run cycling reduction test has been performed in order to investigate about the stability of the optimal Ag2CrO4/NG/PI hybrid (25AN).Based on the results (Fig. 9b), after the decrease in the first four cycling runs, the CO2 conversion rate altered slightly indicating the stability of Ag2CrO4/NG/PI hybrids in the reaction.To gain further knowledge, the composites photoactivity under visible light irradiation (450 nm), besides their stability, was investigated.Based on the results a significant decrease up to 21.4 molh -1 gcat -1 was observed for the CO2 conversion rate of 25AN.However, in comparison with the activity of NG (10.0 molh -1 gcat -1 ), the promotion effect of Ag2CrO4 was still apparent.As previously been noticed, both the decreased light intensity and the limited absorbed light could be responsible for the reduced photoactivity under visible light 63.The effectiveness of utilizing light of shorter wavelength (255 nm) in irradiation in comparison with 350 nm for CO2 photoreduction by titanium oxide has been delineated 63.However, the low photocataltyic activity under visible light offered challenges for the promising reaction of photocatalytic CO2 reduction into fuels.Indeed, Ag2CrO4/NG/PI hybrid demonstrated great catalytic activity for RhB photodegradation.The RhB solution under visible light irradiation for 17 min could entirely be blanched in the presence of the 25AN sample, with a degradation rate of 0.24 min -1 , which was 6.3 times higher than those of NG and 3.7 times higher than those of Ag2CrO4. In general photo-assisted catalytic process have approved that two key factors including the absorption of light capacity and ability of EHPs separation improve the photocatalyst efficiency.meanwhile, in the case of the nanaocomposites such as Ag2CrO4/NG/PI high surface area is advantageous for the better performance as a photocatalyst for CO2 reduction.FE-SEM and AFM experiments has confirmed that the higher surface areas contribute to higher catalytic activities of Ag2CrO4/NG/PI nanocomposites.According to the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra, the addition of Ag2CrO4 could enhance the photoassisted catalytic function of NG, however, this could not demonstrate its high performance of photoactivity.Moreover, the photoluminescence spectra, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and photocurrent analysis, showed that the addition of Ag2CrO4 to NG could considerably increase the distance of EHPs, which, as previously reported, was based on the high photoassisted catalytic performance of Ag/graphene based nano composites 646566.The silver ions should exhibit its important role in separation of EHPs since Ag -NPs were also constructed the nanocomposite 67686970.Nevertheless, the key role of the coupling effect of Ag2CrO4 and NG has been confirmed by photocatalytic results but an subject respecting the transfer route of the photoassisted charge transfer process in the system still remained.Therefore a doubletransmission mechanism can be suggested for photocatalytic performance of the Ag2CrO4/NG/PI 646566.This mechanism indicates that the photogenerated electron in the conduction band of NG would transfer to that of Ag2CrO4, while the holes amass on the valance band of NG.Therefore, the electron and holes were properly separated.Moreover, since the electrons in the conduction band of Ag2CrO4 and holes in the valance band of NG owned adequate redutive or oxidiative ability to decompose dye molecules, such a mechanism would function for dye photodassisted-decomposition.In the current case, however, the double-transmission system could not explicate the effectivness of Ag2CrO4/NG/PI in photoassisted-catalytic function on CO2 reduction.Thus, CO2 reduction can not be promoted by the addition of Ag2CrO4 to NG if the Ag2CrO4/NG/PI nanocomposites follow the double-transmission system.Ag2CrO4/Ag 0 , can be assumed to conform with a Z-scheme photocatalytic system 71, which brought on the belief that the Z-scheme photoassisted-catalytic mechanism probably works in the Ag2CrO4 /NG/PI composite since NG and Ag2CrO4 have same conduction and valance bands positions.Moreover, the similarity of the distances between these bands has an important role to follow Z-scheme photoassisted-catalytic mechanism.Probably Ag nanoparticles function as a charge conduction bridge to create the Ag2CrO4/NG/PI Z-scheme photoassistedcatalytic mechanism.Two simultaneous events happen in this phase first the photogenerated electrons in the Notably this form of charge transfer can elevate the EHPs distance and enable the electrons and holes to stay on the conduction band of NG and valence band of Ag2CrO4, respectively.These electrons, owing to the negative ECB of NG, with their strong reducibility can simply abate CO2 to CH4, CO, MeOH, and EtOH.The obtained result is congruent with the results in Fig. 4a.Photoassisted catalytic system of Ag2CrO4/NG/PI composite is shown in Fig. 5. In order to scrutinize the most important effective compounds in the oxidative photoassisted catalytic of RhB over the Ag2CrO4/NG/PI nanocomposites, the reactive species harvesting tests have been designed.These experiments are beneficial in concluding the charge transmission path in the composite 72,73.The photoassisted-catalytic process of 25AN with diverse quenchers is exhibited in Fig. S5.Remarkably, no obvious effect for IPA or Isopropanol as an OH60-62 quencher on the degradation rate of RhB has been observed.However, the introduction of benzoquinone (BQ, O2 -scavenger) 73,74 decreased the RhB decomposition rate from 0.2 min -1 to 0.02 and EDTA (h scavenger) introduction 74,75 decreased it to 0.11 min -1 , suggesting that O2 -and h were the most important effective species in the photoassisted-catalytic processes of Ag2CrO4/NG/PI nanocomposites.Also, the reactive species harvesting tests were done using the same procedure for the samples of Ag2CrO4and NG.The results (Fig. 8d) indicated that h was the foremost effective compounds in the RhB decomposition of Ag2CrO4, which was in line with the prior published articles 75 The result is admissible by bearing in mind that the conduction band potential of Ag2CrO4is much lower than the standard reduction ability of O2 -/O2,.Similar to Ag2CrO4/NG/PI, the foremost reactive species for pure NG are O2 -and h.Undoubtedly, the conduction band of NG the electron can be improved by electrons that reduces O2 to O 2 -in Ag2CrO4/NG/PI only when the electron and holes transfer by the Zscheme mechanism.If not, accumulation of the photo-excited electron on the conduction band of Ag2CrO4 leads to the controlling effective species of h, which is incongruent with the obtained results.The provided data in Fig. 8d confirm that efficient Ag2CrO4/NG/PI nanocomposites follow the photoassisted catalytic Z-scheme system.Under these circumstances, the photoassisted catalytic EH in the hybrides are segregated properly and hence an excellent photocatalytic activity is achieved.In the current study, the great effectiveness of photoassisted catalytic Z-scheme system is demonstrated, and a promising method or the photocatalytic abatement of CO2 to fuels, also, the environmental protection of air pollution utilizing photo-assisted catalytic approach is provided."}, {"llm generation": "5AN-50AN", "source": "The outcomes of photocatalytic performance assessments of the Ag2CrO4/NG/PI nano-composites (5AN-50AN), Ag2CrO4, Ag2CrO4/NG, Ag2CrO4/PI and NG/PI which were examined by the photoreduction of CO2 are presented in Fig. 9a.", "context": "The (211) crystal plane of Ag2CrO4 structure attributed to the diffraction peak at 231.4.It is mentioned that the XRD analysis of Ag2CrO4/PI, Ag2CrO4/NG and 25AN show the similar signals as bare Ag2CrO4, but the intensities of 25AN peaks are stronger than that of Ag2CrO4/PI and Ag2CrO4/NG.Therefore, the ternary nanocomposits is more impressive than the duplex compound to confirm the original crystal structure of Ag2CrO4 from being ruined.After decomposition the XRD pattern of the photocatalysts showed the corresponding peaks with reduced intensity, but they maintained basically unaffected, demonstrating the high resistance of the synthesized catalysts.The morphological properties of the synthesized compounds was studied by FE-SEM, TEM and AFM (Fig. 2 and3).3c andd as rippling sheets.In addition, it was clear that the Ag2CrO4 -NPs in the Ag2CrO4/PI (Fig. 3e) and Ag2CrO4/NG (Fig. 3f) are immobilized on the surfaces of PI and NG, respectively. In Fig. 2 c, it clearly observed that globular shaped Ag2CrO4 NPs are immobilized on NG and PI.XPS analysis probed the chemical composition of the as prepared nanocomposites that shown in Fig. S2 andS3.The XPS spectrum of NG was shown in Fig. S3a FT-IR spectra of the synthesized compounds (Fig. 5) confirm the achieved XRD results.FT-IR spectrum of Ag2CrO4, showed the strong and sharp band at 877 cm -1 that can be attributed to Cr-O stretching vibration in CrO4 2- 54.meanwhile, FT-IR spectrums of 5AN, 15AN, 35 AN and 50 AN were showed in Fig. S4 that reveals the structure of these compounds. FT-IR analysis of duplex and triplex compounds was performed to recognize the functional groups of the synthesized compounds.Fig. 5 shows FT-IR spectrum of NG shows a peaks at 1385 cm -1 that can be assigned to the vibrational mode of C-N bonds 55.Consequently this peak approves the doping of N on the graphene surface.Meanwhile, the FT-IR spectrum of PI, contains several bands at 1376, 1725, 1772, and 725 cm -1 that can be attributed to the carbonnitrogen stretching mode, asymmetric stretching, symmetrical stretching and bending modes of the imidic ring absorption peak 56.The similarity of Ag2CrO4 signal intensities in FT-IR spectrum of duplex and triplex nanocatalysts confirms the XRD results.The electronic properties of the synthesized compounds (Ag2CrO4, Ag2CrO4/PI, Ag2CrO4/NG and 25AN) were investigated using UV-vis DRS.Fig. 6 showed the UV-vis DRS of Ag2CrO4 that contains a broad signal at the range of 500-600 nm which can be attributed to Ag2CrO4.The UV-vis DRS of Ag2CrO4/PI, Ag2CrO4/NG and 25AN nanocomposites show higher intensities peculiarly in UV region.The UV-vis DRS absorption peaks are more intense than Ag2CrO4 at the 400-800 nm except that Ag2CrO4/PI is moderately decreased at the range of 450-800 nm.As expected, the absorption intensity 25AN is enhanced in the vis light.The enhanced intensity of UV-vis DRS absorption of the synthesized compounds can be assigned to two reducing agents including of grephenoxide and PI that reduces the reflection of light.Hence, it can be found that the presence of NG and PI would simplify the improvement of vis-absorbance and also facilitate the chare separation phenomena in the nanocomposites toward the light, leads to improvement of photo-assisted catalytic efficiency.Fig. 6b presents the valence band energy of the compounds that was acheived by the Kubelka-Munk formula.The band gap of PI, Ag2CrO4 and 25AN composite photocatalysts are 2.78eV, 1.72 eV, 1.08 eV, respectively.Accord with the obtained data, the combination of Ag2CrO4, NG and PI resulted in decreasing the band gap of the photocatalyst, and increasing the UV-vis DRS absorption region of Ag2CrO4. The photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra of Ag2CrO4, Ag2CrO4/PI, Ag2CrO4/NG and 25AN composites were exhibited in Fig. 7a.The characteristic peak of these photocatalysts appears at 534 nm.As shown in Fig. 7a the photoluminescence intensity directly relates to the reconstruction of EHPs.Compared with bare Ag2CrO4, the PL intensity of Ag2CrO4-based catalyst is clearly quenched, that demonstrates that the combination of NG and PI can impressively affect on the charge separation of the compounds which resulted in the enhancement of photo-assisted catalytic performance.Fig. 7b showed that the initial photocurrent density of Ag2CrO4 was 0.8Acm -2 , but its photocurrent density decayed rapidly and decreased to 0.3 Acm -2 after 500 s, which indicates that Ag2CrO4 was unstable under visible light (420nm).The photocurrent density of PI was 0.15Acm -2 , and it was still stable under visible light within 500s. The photocurrent density of 25AN composites was 2Acm -2 , which was 2.5 times that of Ag2CrO4 and far exceeded the sum of Ag2CrO4 and PI.It suggests that there was a synergistic effect between Ag2CrO4 and PI to significantly enhance the photoelectric response intensity and effectively inhibit the photo-corrosion.It was also observed that the photoluminescence intensity of 25AN (Fig. 6) was weakened due to the introduction of PI and NG to increase the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs caused by the charge transport between Ag2CrO4 and PI, thereby improving the photocatalytic performance of 25AN.EIS is a powerful tool for studying a material's electrochemical conductivity properties.The EIS Nyquist plots of the materials shown in Fig. 7c andd were measured in the frequency range of 106-0.1 Hz with amplitude of 5 mV at a bias potential of 0 V versus Ag/AgCl.The impedance of the EIS Nyquist plots is the impedance of the catalyst, catalyst/electrolyte and catalyst/catalyst interface.The lower the impedance is, the higher the efficiency of the photogenerated carrier separation and the lower the interface resistance are.The minimum interfacial impedance (50) of 25AN composite implies that the composite has better electron transport capability and higher photogenerated carrier separation efficiency than Ag2CrO4 or PI alone 57,58.From the above photoelectrochemical analysis, it can be deduced that the photocatalytic activity and stability of 25AN composite are derived from its stable and efficient photoelectric conversion property, excellent photogenerated carrier separation efficiency and electron transport capability. Raman spectroscopy as a powerful and non-destructive method has been widely applied to characterize the structure and electronic properties of carbon materials, such as NG.Fig. 8 shows typical Raman spectra of NG and 25AN.This Fig presents two intense Raman features, which are assigned to G (1581 cm -1 ) and 2D (2674 cm -1 ) peaks 59.In addition to these two peaks, NG and 25AN present a strong D peak located at 1344 cm -1 , which is activated by defects, i.e., in-plane substitution heteroatoms, vacancies, or grain boundaries/ edges 60, through an intervalley double resonance Raman process.The appearance of D peak in NG (ID/IG 1.25) and 25AN (ID/IG 1.3) indicates that there are similar numbers of defects in these two samples, due to the substitution of nitrogen dopants and the introduction of vacancies during ion bombardment.An additional peak located at 1620 cm -1 (D0 peak) is also observed for NG and 25AN, which originates from the intravalley double resonance scattering process 60.However, the D0 peak of NG is more prominent compared to that of DG; in the other words, ID/ID0 is smaller for NG with similar amount of defects.This is related to different natures of defects in NG and 25AN It is well known that the BET specific surface area is commonly considered as an important influencing factor of the photocatalytic performance of photocatalyst.Generally, photocatalytic degradation is an interfacial reaction, a large BET specific surface area can provide more adsorption sites for CO2 photoreduction due to the adsorption of CO2 on the surface of photocatalyst is usually considered as the initial step in the decomposition of CO2, so increasing the contact opportunities between CO2 and photocatalyst, finally achieving excellent CO2 photoreduction.As a consequence, in order to determine the specific surface areas of the asobtained samples, nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms were carried out.It can be found that the nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms of all the samples displayed type IV with a H3 hysteresis loops according to the Brunauer-Deming-Deming-Teller (BDDT) classification demonstrating that the asynthesized samples have mesoporous surface.Moreover, the BET specific surface area of 25AN is 63.8 m 2 /g, which is much higher than that of Ag2CrO4 (1.79 m 2 /g). The outcomes of photocatalytic performance assessments of the Ag2CrO4/NG/PI nano-composites (5AN-50AN), Ag2CrO4, Ag2CrO4/NG, Ag2CrO4/PI and NG/PI which were examined by the photoreduction of CO2 are presented in Fig. 9a.Carbon monoxide (CO), methanol (MeOH), methane (CH4), and ethanol (EtOH) were produced. Moreover, in the absence of light irradiation or diverse photocatalyst, the blank test was done which indicated that the products could be neglected.The rate of CO2 reduction was 10.0 molh -1 g cat -1 was demonstrated by pure NG. The achieved products were carbonmonoxide, methane, or methanol, and ethanol.(Actually from a theoretical point of view, other products including of hydrogen and oxygen should be observed because H2O was another reactant . It is noteworthy that the undetectability of the two products was due to two factors including the low sensitivity of the TCD detector and low concentration of them.)The diverse distribution of the achieved product using these photo assisted catalysts can mainly be ascribed to their varied conduction band positions.Due to the strong redox ability of the photogenerated electrons in NG, it can reduce CO2 to either MeOH or EtOH 62.Accordingly, no photocatalytic reduction of CO2 was acheived over the pure Ag2CrO4 catalyst.The separation efficiency of EHP and the ability of light absorption can be promoted by the deposition of Ag2CrO4 on NG leading to the enhancement of catalytic performance for photoreduction of CO2.A gradual increase in the photocatalytic activity of Ag2CrO4/NG/PI was observed with an increase of Ag2CrO4 concentration from 10 to 30 .Later on, excessive deposition of Ag2CrO4 could result in shielding of the active site on NG surfaces which subsequently leads to the catalytic efficiency reduction.Notably, the 25AN sample showed the highest rate of 68.32 molh -1 gcat -1 for CO2 reduction which was 6.8 times higher than of NG.Fig. 9a shows the comparable charts indicating photocatalytic conversion CO2 in presence of different samples.It is clearly observed that CO2 reduction has been significantly promoted from 10.0 to 68.32 molh -1 g cat -1 by doping of Ag2CrO4-NPs on NG.However, in comparison with 30AC, the photoactivity of Ag2CrO4/NG was still much lower which confirmed the superiority of the Ag2CrO4/NG/PI hetero-junction.The high photoactivity of the Ag2CrO4/NG/PI composites has been corroborated, albeit their stability in regard to practical applications was not evident.Consequently, a eight-run cycling reduction test has been performed in order to investigate about the stability of the optimal Ag2CrO4/NG/PI hybrid (25AN).Based on the results (Fig. 9b), after the decrease in the first four cycling runs, the CO2 conversion rate altered slightly indicating the stability of Ag2CrO4/NG/PI hybrids in the reaction.To gain further knowledge, the composites photoactivity under visible light irradiation (450 nm), besides their stability, was investigated.Based on the results a significant decrease up to 21.4 molh -1 gcat -1 was observed for the CO2 conversion rate of 25AN.However, in comparison with the activity of NG (10.0 molh -1 gcat -1 ), the promotion effect of Ag2CrO4 was still apparent.As previously been noticed, both the decreased light intensity and the limited absorbed light could be responsible for the reduced photoactivity under visible light 63.The effectiveness of utilizing light of shorter wavelength (255 nm) in irradiation in comparison with 350 nm for CO2 photoreduction by titanium oxide has been delineated 63.However, the low photocataltyic activity under visible light offered challenges for the promising reaction of photocatalytic CO2 reduction into fuels.Indeed, Ag2CrO4/NG/PI hybrid demonstrated great catalytic activity for RhB photodegradation.The RhB solution under visible light irradiation for 17 min could entirely be blanched in the presence of the 25AN sample, with a degradation rate of 0.24 min -1 , which was 6.3 times higher than those of NG and 3.7 times higher than those of Ag2CrO4. In general photo-assisted catalytic process have approved that two key factors including the absorption of light capacity and ability of EHPs separation improve the photocatalyst efficiency.meanwhile, in the case of the nanaocomposites such as Ag2CrO4/NG/PI high surface area is advantageous for the better performance as a photocatalyst for CO2 reduction.FE-SEM and AFM experiments has confirmed that the higher surface areas contribute to higher catalytic activities of Ag2CrO4/NG/PI nanocomposites.According to the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra, the addition of Ag2CrO4 could enhance the photoassisted catalytic function of NG, however, this could not demonstrate its high performance of photoactivity.Moreover, the photoluminescence spectra, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and photocurrent analysis, showed that the addition of Ag2CrO4 to NG could considerably increase the distance of EHPs, which, as previously reported, was based on the high photoassisted catalytic performance of Ag/graphene based nano composites 646566.The silver ions should exhibit its important role in separation of EHPs since Ag -NPs were also constructed the nanocomposite 67686970.Nevertheless, the key role of the coupling effect of Ag2CrO4 and NG has been confirmed by photocatalytic results but an subject respecting the transfer route of the photoassisted charge transfer process in the system still remained.Therefore a doubletransmission mechanism can be suggested for photocatalytic performance of the Ag2CrO4/NG/PI 646566.This mechanism indicates that the photogenerated electron in the conduction band of NG would transfer to that of Ag2CrO4, while the holes amass on the valance band of NG.Therefore, the electron and holes were properly separated.Moreover, since the electrons in the conduction band of Ag2CrO4 and holes in the valance band of NG owned adequate redutive or oxidiative ability to decompose dye molecules, such a mechanism would function for dye photodassisted-decomposition.In the current case, however, the double-transmission system could not explicate the effectivness of Ag2CrO4/NG/PI in photoassisted-catalytic function on CO2 reduction.Thus, CO2 reduction can not be promoted by the addition of Ag2CrO4 to NG if the Ag2CrO4/NG/PI nanocomposites follow the double-transmission system.Ag2CrO4/Ag 0 , can be assumed to conform with a Z-scheme photocatalytic system 71, which brought on the belief that the Z-scheme photoassisted-catalytic mechanism probably works in the Ag2CrO4 /NG/PI composite since NG and Ag2CrO4 have same conduction and valance bands positions.Moreover, the similarity of the distances between these bands has an important role to follow Z-scheme photoassisted-catalytic mechanism.Probably Ag nanoparticles function as a charge conduction bridge to create the Ag2CrO4/NG/PI Z-scheme photoassistedcatalytic mechanism.Two simultaneous events happen in this phase first the photogenerated electrons in the Notably this form of charge transfer can elevate the EHPs distance and enable the electrons and holes to stay on the conduction band of NG and valence band of Ag2CrO4, respectively.These electrons, owing to the negative ECB of NG, with their strong reducibility can simply abate CO2 to CH4, CO, MeOH, and EtOH.The obtained result is congruent with the results in Fig. 4a.Photoassisted catalytic system of Ag2CrO4/NG/PI composite is shown in Fig. 5. In order to scrutinize the most important effective compounds in the oxidative photoassisted catalytic of RhB over the Ag2CrO4/NG/PI nanocomposites, the reactive species harvesting tests have been designed.These experiments are beneficial in concluding the charge transmission path in the composite 72,73.The photoassisted-catalytic process of 25AN with diverse quenchers is exhibited in Fig. S5.Remarkably, no obvious effect for IPA or Isopropanol as an OH60-62 quencher on the degradation rate of RhB has been observed.However, the introduction of benzoquinone (BQ, O2 -scavenger) 73,74 decreased the RhB decomposition rate from 0.2 min -1 to 0.02 and EDTA (h scavenger) introduction 74,75 decreased it to 0.11 min -1 , suggesting that O2 -and h were the most important effective species in the photoassisted-catalytic processes of Ag2CrO4/NG/PI nanocomposites.Also, the reactive species harvesting tests were done using the same procedure for the samples of Ag2CrO4and NG.The results (Fig. 8d) indicated that h was the foremost effective compounds in the RhB decomposition of Ag2CrO4, which was in line with the prior published articles 75 The result is admissible by bearing in mind that the conduction band potential of Ag2CrO4is much lower than the standard reduction ability of O2 -/O2,.Similar to Ag2CrO4/NG/PI, the foremost reactive species for pure NG are O2 -and h.Undoubtedly, the conduction band of NG the electron can be improved by electrons that reduces O2 to O 2 -in Ag2CrO4/NG/PI only when the electron and holes transfer by the Zscheme mechanism.If not, accumulation of the photo-excited electron on the conduction band of Ag2CrO4 leads to the controlling effective species of h, which is incongruent with the obtained results.The provided data in Fig. 8d confirm that efficient Ag2CrO4/NG/PI nanocomposites follow the photoassisted catalytic Z-scheme system.Under these circumstances, the photoassisted catalytic EH in the hybrides are segregated properly and hence an excellent photocatalytic activity is achieved.In the current study, the great effectiveness of photoassisted catalytic Z-scheme system is demonstrated, and a promising method or the photocatalytic abatement of CO2 to fuels, also, the environmental protection of air pollution utilizing photo-assisted catalytic approach is provided."}, {"llm generation": "NG/PI", "source": "The outcomes of photocatalytic performance assessments of the Ag2CrO4/NG/PI nano-composites (5AN-50AN), Ag2CrO4, Ag2CrO4/NG, Ag2CrO4/PI and NG/PI which were examined by the photoreduction of CO2 are presented in Fig. 9a.", "context": "The (211) crystal plane of Ag2CrO4 structure attributed to the diffraction peak at 231.4.It is mentioned that the XRD analysis of Ag2CrO4/PI, Ag2CrO4/NG and 25AN show the similar signals as bare Ag2CrO4, but the intensities of 25AN peaks are stronger than that of Ag2CrO4/PI and Ag2CrO4/NG.Therefore, the ternary nanocomposits is more impressive than the duplex compound to confirm the original crystal structure of Ag2CrO4 from being ruined.After decomposition the XRD pattern of the photocatalysts showed the corresponding peaks with reduced intensity, but they maintained basically unaffected, demonstrating the high resistance of the synthesized catalysts.The morphological properties of the synthesized compounds was studied by FE-SEM, TEM and AFM (Fig. 2 and3).3c andd as rippling sheets.In addition, it was clear that the Ag2CrO4 -NPs in the Ag2CrO4/PI (Fig. 3e) and Ag2CrO4/NG (Fig. 3f) are immobilized on the surfaces of PI and NG, respectively.

The photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra of Ag2CrO4, Ag2CrO4/PI, Ag2CrO4/NG and 25AN composites were exhibited in Fig. 7a.The characteristic peak of these photocatalysts appears at 534 nm.As shown in Fig. 7a the photoluminescence intensity directly relates to the reconstruction of EHPs.Compared with bare Ag2CrO4, the PL intensity of Ag2CrO4-based catalyst is clearly quenched, that demonstrates that the combination of NG and PI can impressively affect on the charge separation of the compounds which resulted in the enhancement of photo-assisted catalytic performance.Fig. 7b showed that the initial photocurrent density of Ag2CrO4 was 0.8Acm -2 , but its photocurrent density decayed rapidly and decreased to 0.3 Acm -2 after 500 s, which indicates that Ag2CrO4 was unstable under visible light (420nm).The photocurrent density of PI was 0.15Acm -2 , and it was still stable under visible light within 500s. The photocurrent density of 25AN composites was 2Acm -2 , which was 2.5 times that of Ag2CrO4 and far exceeded the sum of Ag2CrO4 and PI.It suggests that there was a synergistic effect between Ag2CrO4 and PI to significantly enhance the photoelectric response intensity and effectively inhibit the photo-corrosion.It was also observed that the photoluminescence intensity of 25AN (Fig. 6) was weakened due to the introduction of PI and NG to increase the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs caused by the charge transport between Ag2CrO4 and PI, thereby improving the photocatalytic performance of 25AN.EIS is a powerful tool for studying a material's electrochemical conductivity properties.The EIS Nyquist plots of the materials shown in Fig. 7c andd were measured in the frequency range of 106-0.1 Hz with amplitude of 5 mV at a bias potential of 0 V versus Ag/AgCl.The impedance of the EIS Nyquist plots is the impedance of the catalyst, catalyst/electrolyte and catalyst/catalyst interface.The lower the impedance is, the higher the efficiency of the photogenerated carrier separation and the lower the interface resistance are.The minimum interfacial impedance (50) of 25AN composite implies that the composite has better electron transport capability and higher photogenerated carrier separation efficiency than Ag2CrO4 or PI alone 57,58.From the above photoelectrochemical analysis, it can be deduced that the photocatalytic activity and stability of 25AN composite are derived from its stable and efficient photoelectric conversion property, excellent photogenerated carrier separation efficiency and electron transport capability. Raman spectroscopy as a powerful and non-destructive method has been widely applied to characterize the structure and electronic properties of carbon materials, such as NG.Fig. 8 shows typical Raman spectra of NG and 25AN.This Fig presents two intense Raman features, which are assigned to G (1581 cm -1 ) and 2D (2674 cm -1 ) peaks 59.In addition to these two peaks, NG and 25AN present a strong D peak located at 1344 cm -1 , which is activated by defects, i.e., in-plane substitution heteroatoms, vacancies, or grain boundaries/ edges 60, through an intervalley double resonance Raman process.The appearance of D peak in NG (ID/IG 1.25) and 25AN (ID/IG 1.3) indicates that there are similar numbers of defects in these two samples, due to the substitution of nitrogen dopants and the introduction of vacancies during ion bombardment.An additional peak located at 1620 cm -1 (D0 peak) is also observed for NG and 25AN, which originates from the intravalley double resonance scattering process 60.However, the D0 peak of NG is more prominent compared to that of DG; in the other words, ID/ID0 is smaller for NG with similar amount of defects.This is related to different natures of defects in NG and 25AN It is well known that the BET specific surface area is commonly considered as an important influencing factor of the photocatalytic performance of photocatalyst.Generally, photocatalytic degradation is an interfacial reaction, a large BET specific surface area can provide more adsorption sites for CO2 photoreduction due to the adsorption of CO2 on the surface of photocatalyst is usually considered as the initial step in the decomposition of CO2, so increasing the contact opportunities between CO2 and photocatalyst, finally achieving excellent CO2 photoreduction.As a consequence, in order to determine the specific surface areas of the asobtained samples, nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms were carried out.It can be found that the nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms of all the samples displayed type IV with a H3 hysteresis loops according to the Brunauer-Deming-Deming-Teller (BDDT) classification demonstrating that the asynthesized samples have mesoporous surface.Moreover, the BET specific surface area of 25AN is 63.8 m 2 /g, which is much higher than that of Ag2CrO4 (1.79 m 2 /g). The outcomes of photocatalytic performance assessments of the Ag2CrO4/NG/PI nano-composites (5AN-50AN), Ag2CrO4, Ag2CrO4/NG, Ag2CrO4/PI and NG/PI which were examined by the photoreduction of CO2 are presented in Fig. 9a.Carbon monoxide (CO), methanol (MeOH), methane (CH4), and ethanol (EtOH) were produced. Moreover, in the absence of light irradiation or diverse photocatalyst, the blank test was done which indicated that the products could be neglected.The rate of CO2 reduction was 10.0 molh -1 g cat -1 was demonstrated by pure NG. The achieved products were carbonmonoxide, methane, or methanol, and ethanol.(Actually from a theoretical point of view, other products including of hydrogen and oxygen should be observed because H2O was another reactant . It is noteworthy that the undetectability of the two products was due to two factors including the low sensitivity of the TCD detector and low concentration of them.)The diverse distribution of the achieved product using these photo assisted catalysts can mainly be ascribed to their varied conduction band positions.Due to the strong redox ability of the photogenerated electrons in NG, it can reduce CO2 to either MeOH or EtOH 62.Accordingly, no photocatalytic reduction of CO2 was acheived over the pure Ag2CrO4 catalyst.The separation efficiency of EHP and the ability of light absorption can be promoted by the deposition of Ag2CrO4 on NG leading to the enhancement of catalytic performance for photoreduction of CO2.A gradual increase in the photocatalytic activity of Ag2CrO4/NG/PI was observed with an increase of Ag2CrO4 concentration from 10 to 30 .Later on, excessive deposition of Ag2CrO4 could result in shielding of the active site on NG surfaces which subsequently leads to the catalytic efficiency reduction.Notably, the 25AN sample showed the highest rate of 68.32 molh -1 gcat -1 for CO2 reduction which was 6.8 times higher than of NG.Fig. 9a shows the comparable charts indicating photocatalytic conversion CO2 in presence of different samples.It is clearly observed that CO2 reduction has been significantly promoted from 10.0 to 68.32 molh -1 g cat -1 by doping of Ag2CrO4-NPs on NG.However, in comparison with 30AC, the photoactivity of Ag2CrO4/NG was still much lower which confirmed the superiority of the Ag2CrO4/NG/PI hetero-junction.The high photoactivity of the Ag2CrO4/NG/PI composites has been corroborated, albeit their stability in regard to practical applications was not evident.Consequently, a eight-run cycling reduction test has been performed in order to investigate about the stability of the optimal Ag2CrO4/NG/PI hybrid (25AN).Based on the results (Fig. 9b), after the decrease in the first four cycling runs, the CO2 conversion rate altered slightly indicating the stability of Ag2CrO4/NG/PI hybrids in the reaction.To gain further knowledge, the composites photoactivity under visible light irradiation (450 nm), besides their stability, was investigated.Based on the results a significant decrease up to 21.4 molh -1 gcat -1 was observed for the CO2 conversion rate of 25AN.However, in comparison with the activity of NG (10.0 molh -1 gcat -1 ), the promotion effect of Ag2CrO4 was still apparent.As previously been noticed, both the decreased light intensity and the limited absorbed light could be responsible for the reduced photoactivity under visible light 63.The effectiveness of utilizing light of shorter wavelength (255 nm) in irradiation in comparison with 350 nm for CO2 photoreduction by titanium oxide has been delineated 63.However, the low photocataltyic activity under visible light offered challenges for the promising reaction of photocatalytic CO2 reduction into fuels.Indeed, Ag2CrO4/NG/PI hybrid demonstrated great catalytic activity for RhB photodegradation.The RhB solution under visible light irradiation for 17 min could entirely be blanched in the presence of the 25AN sample, with a degradation rate of 0.24 min -1 , which was 6.3 times higher than those of NG and 3.7 times higher than those of Ag2CrO4. In general photo-assisted catalytic process have approved that two key factors including the absorption of light capacity and ability of EHPs separation improve the photocatalyst efficiency.meanwhile, in the case of the nanaocomposites such as Ag2CrO4/NG/PI high surface area is advantageous for the better performance as a photocatalyst for CO2 reduction.FE-SEM and AFM experiments has confirmed that the higher surface areas contribute to higher catalytic activities of Ag2CrO4/NG/PI nanocomposites.According to the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra, the addition of Ag2CrO4 could enhance the photoassisted catalytic function of NG, however, this could not demonstrate its high performance of photoactivity.Moreover, the photoluminescence spectra, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and photocurrent analysis, showed that the addition of Ag2CrO4 to NG could considerably increase the distance of EHPs, which, as previously reported, was based on the high photoassisted catalytic performance of Ag/graphene based nano composites 646566.The silver ions should exhibit its important role in separation of EHPs since Ag -NPs were also constructed the nanocomposite 67686970.Nevertheless, the key role of the coupling effect of Ag2CrO4 and NG has been confirmed by photocatalytic results but an subject respecting the transfer route of the photoassisted charge transfer process in the system still remained.Therefore a doubletransmission mechanism can be suggested for photocatalytic performance of the Ag2CrO4/NG/PI 646566.This mechanism indicates that the photogenerated electron in the conduction band of NG would transfer to that of Ag2CrO4, while the holes amass on the valance band of NG.Therefore, the electron and holes were properly separated.Moreover, since the electrons in the conduction band of Ag2CrO4 and holes in the valance band of NG owned adequate redutive or oxidiative ability to decompose dye molecules, such a mechanism would function for dye photodassisted-decomposition.In the current case, however, the double-transmission system could not explicate the effectivness of Ag2CrO4/NG/PI in photoassisted-catalytic function on CO2 reduction.Thus, CO2 reduction can not be promoted by the addition of Ag2CrO4 to NG if the Ag2CrO4/NG/PI nanocomposites follow the double-transmission system.Ag2CrO4/Ag 0 , can be assumed to conform with a Z-scheme photocatalytic system 71, which brought on the belief that the Z-scheme photoassisted-catalytic mechanism probably works in the Ag2CrO4 /NG/PI composite since NG and Ag2CrO4 have same conduction and valance bands positions.Moreover, the similarity of the distances between these bands has an important role to follow Z-scheme photoassisted-catalytic mechanism.Probably Ag nanoparticles function as a charge conduction bridge to create the Ag2CrO4/NG/PI Z-scheme photoassistedcatalytic mechanism.Two simultaneous events happen in this phase first the photogenerated electrons in the Notably this form of charge transfer can elevate the EHPs distance and enable the electrons and holes to stay on the conduction band of NG and valence band of Ag2CrO4, respectively.These electrons, owing to the negative ECB of NG, with their strong reducibility can simply abate CO2 to CH4, CO, MeOH, and EtOH.The obtained result is congruent with the results in Fig. 4a.Photoassisted catalytic system of Ag2CrO4/NG/PI composite is shown in Fig. 5. In order to scrutinize the most important effective compounds in the oxidative photoassisted catalytic of RhB over the Ag2CrO4/NG/PI nanocomposites, the reactive species harvesting tests have been designed.These experiments are beneficial in concluding the charge transmission path in the composite 72,73.The photoassisted-catalytic process of 25AN with diverse quenchers is exhibited in Fig. S5.Remarkably, no obvious effect for IPA or Isopropanol as an OH60-62 quencher on the degradation rate of RhB has been observed.However, the introduction of benzoquinone (BQ, O2 -scavenger) 73,74 decreased the RhB decomposition rate from 0.2 min -1 to 0.02 and EDTA (h scavenger) introduction 74,75 decreased it to 0.11 min -1 , suggesting that O2 -and h were the most important effective species in the photoassisted-catalytic processes of Ag2CrO4/NG/PI nanocomposites.Also, the reactive species harvesting tests were done using the same procedure for the samples of Ag2CrO4and NG.The results (Fig. 8d) indicated that h was the foremost effective compounds in the RhB decomposition of Ag2CrO4, which was in line with the prior published articles 75 The result is admissible by bearing in mind that the conduction band potential of Ag2CrO4is much lower than the standard reduction ability of O2 -/O2,.Similar to Ag2CrO4/NG/PI, the foremost reactive species for pure NG are O2 -and h.Undoubtedly, the conduction band of NG the electron can be improved by electrons that reduces O2 to O 2 -in Ag2CrO4/NG/PI only when the electron and holes transfer by the Zscheme mechanism.If not, accumulation of the photo-excited electron on the conduction band of Ag2CrO4 leads to the controlling effective species of h, which is incongruent with the obtained results.The provided data in Fig. 8d confirm that efficient Ag2CrO4/NG/PI nanocomposites follow the photoassisted catalytic Z-scheme system.Under these circumstances, the photoassisted catalytic EH in the hybrides are segregated properly and hence an excellent photocatalytic activity is achieved.In the current study, the great effectiveness of photoassisted catalytic Z-scheme system is demonstrated, and a promising method or the photocatalytic abatement of CO2 to fuels, also, the environmental protection of air pollution utilizing photo-assisted catalytic approach is provided."}, {"llm generation": "30AC", "source": "However, in comparison with 30AC, the photoactivity of Ag2CrO4/NG was still much lower which confirmed the superiority of the Ag2CrO4/NG/PI hetero-junction.", "context": "The (211) crystal plane of Ag2CrO4 structure attributed to the diffraction peak at 231.4.It is mentioned that the XRD analysis of Ag2CrO4/PI, Ag2CrO4/NG and 25AN show the similar signals as bare Ag2CrO4, but the intensities of 25AN peaks are stronger than that of Ag2CrO4/PI and Ag2CrO4/NG.Therefore, the ternary nanocomposits is more impressive than the duplex compound to confirm the original crystal structure of Ag2CrO4 from being ruined.After decomposition the XRD pattern of the photocatalysts showed the corresponding peaks with reduced intensity, but they maintained basically unaffected, demonstrating the high resistance of the synthesized catalysts.The morphological properties of the synthesized compounds was studied by FE-SEM, TEM and AFM (Fig. 2 and3).3c andd as rippling sheets.In addition, it was clear that the Ag2CrO4 -NPs in the Ag2CrO4/PI (Fig. 3e) and Ag2CrO4/NG (Fig. 3f) are immobilized on the surfaces of PI and NG, respectively. In Fig. 2 c, it clearly observed that globular shaped Ag2CrO4 NPs are immobilized on NG and PI.XPS analysis probed the chemical composition of the as prepared nanocomposites that shown in Fig. S2 andS3.The XPS spectrum of NG was shown in Fig. S3a FT-IR spectra of the synthesized compounds (Fig. 5) confirm the achieved XRD results.FT-IR spectrum of Ag2CrO4, showed the strong and sharp band at 877 cm -1 that can be attributed to Cr-O stretching vibration in CrO4 2- 54.meanwhile, FT-IR spectrums of 5AN, 15AN, 35 AN and 50 AN were showed in Fig. S4 that reveals the structure of these compounds. FT-IR analysis of duplex and triplex compounds was performed to recognize the functional groups of the synthesized compounds.Fig. 5 shows FT-IR spectrum of NG shows a peaks at 1385 cm -1 that can be assigned to the vibrational mode of C-N bonds 55.Consequently this peak approves the doping of N on the graphene surface.Meanwhile, the FT-IR spectrum of PI, contains several bands at 1376, 1725, 1772, and 725 cm -1 that can be attributed to the carbonnitrogen stretching mode, asymmetric stretching, symmetrical stretching and bending modes of the imidic ring absorption peak 56.The similarity of Ag2CrO4 signal intensities in FT-IR spectrum of duplex and triplex nanocatalysts confirms the XRD results.The electronic properties of the synthesized compounds (Ag2CrO4, Ag2CrO4/PI, Ag2CrO4/NG and 25AN) were investigated using UV-vis DRS.Fig. 6 showed the UV-vis DRS of Ag2CrO4 that contains a broad signal at the range of 500-600 nm which can be attributed to Ag2CrO4.The UV-vis DRS of Ag2CrO4/PI, Ag2CrO4/NG and 25AN nanocomposites show higher intensities peculiarly in UV region.The UV-vis DRS absorption peaks are more intense than Ag2CrO4 at the 400-800 nm except that Ag2CrO4/PI is moderately decreased at the range of 450-800 nm.As expected, the absorption intensity 25AN is enhanced in the vis light.The enhanced intensity of UV-vis DRS absorption of the synthesized compounds can be assigned to two reducing agents including of grephenoxide and PI that reduces the reflection of light.Hence, it can be found that the presence of NG and PI would simplify the improvement of vis-absorbance and also facilitate the chare separation phenomena in the nanocomposites toward the light, leads to improvement of photo-assisted catalytic efficiency.Fig. 6b presents the valence band energy of the compounds that was acheived by the Kubelka-Munk formula.The band gap of PI, Ag2CrO4 and 25AN composite photocatalysts are 2.78eV, 1.72 eV, 1.08 eV, respectively.Accord with the obtained data, the combination of Ag2CrO4, NG and PI resulted in decreasing the band gap of the photocatalyst, and increasing the UV-vis DRS absorption region of Ag2CrO4. The photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra of Ag2CrO4, Ag2CrO4/PI, Ag2CrO4/NG and 25AN composites were exhibited in Fig. 7a.The characteristic peak of these photocatalysts appears at 534 nm.As shown in Fig. 7a the photoluminescence intensity directly relates to the reconstruction of EHPs.Compared with bare Ag2CrO4, the PL intensity of Ag2CrO4-based catalyst is clearly quenched, that demonstrates that the combination of NG and PI can impressively affect on the charge separation of the compounds which resulted in the enhancement of photo-assisted catalytic performance.Fig. 7b showed that the initial photocurrent density of Ag2CrO4 was 0.8Acm -2 , but its photocurrent density decayed rapidly and decreased to 0.3 Acm -2 after 500 s, which indicates that Ag2CrO4 was unstable under visible light (420nm).The photocurrent density of PI was 0.15Acm -2 , and it was still stable under visible light within 500s. The photocurrent density of 25AN composites was 2Acm -2 , which was 2.5 times that of Ag2CrO4 and far exceeded the sum of Ag2CrO4 and PI.It suggests that there was a synergistic effect between Ag2CrO4 and PI to significantly enhance the photoelectric response intensity and effectively inhibit the photo-corrosion.It was also observed that the photoluminescence intensity of 25AN (Fig. 6) was weakened due to the introduction of PI and NG to increase the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs caused by the charge transport between Ag2CrO4 and PI, thereby improving the photocatalytic performance of 25AN.EIS is a powerful tool for studying a material's electrochemical conductivity properties.The EIS Nyquist plots of the materials shown in Fig. 7c andd were measured in the frequency range of 106-0.1 Hz with amplitude of 5 mV at a bias potential of 0 V versus Ag/AgCl.The impedance of the EIS Nyquist plots is the impedance of the catalyst, catalyst/electrolyte and catalyst/catalyst interface.The lower the impedance is, the higher the efficiency of the photogenerated carrier separation and the lower the interface resistance are.The minimum interfacial impedance (50) of 25AN composite implies that the composite has better electron transport capability and higher photogenerated carrier separation efficiency than Ag2CrO4 or PI alone 57,58.From the above photoelectrochemical analysis, it can be deduced that the photocatalytic activity and stability of 25AN composite are derived from its stable and efficient photoelectric conversion property, excellent photogenerated carrier separation efficiency and electron transport capability. Raman spectroscopy as a powerful and non-destructive method has been widely applied to characterize the structure and electronic properties of carbon materials, such as NG.Fig. 8 shows typical Raman spectra of NG and 25AN.This Fig presents two intense Raman features, which are assigned to G (1581 cm -1 ) and 2D (2674 cm -1 ) peaks 59.In addition to these two peaks, NG and 25AN present a strong D peak located at 1344 cm -1 , which is activated by defects, i.e., in-plane substitution heteroatoms, vacancies, or grain boundaries/ edges 60, through an intervalley double resonance Raman process.The appearance of D peak in NG (ID/IG 1.25) and 25AN (ID/IG 1.3) indicates that there are similar numbers of defects in these two samples, due to the substitution of nitrogen dopants and the introduction of vacancies during ion bombardment.An additional peak located at 1620 cm -1 (D0 peak) is also observed for NG and 25AN, which originates from the intravalley double resonance scattering process 60.However, the D0 peak of NG is more prominent compared to that of DG; in the other words, ID/ID0 is smaller for NG with similar amount of defects.This is related to different natures of defects in NG and 25AN It is well known that the BET specific surface area is commonly considered as an important influencing factor of the photocatalytic performance of photocatalyst.Generally, photocatalytic degradation is an interfacial reaction, a large BET specific surface area can provide more adsorption sites for CO2 photoreduction due to the adsorption of CO2 on the surface of photocatalyst is usually considered as the initial step in the decomposition of CO2, so increasing the contact opportunities between CO2 and photocatalyst, finally achieving excellent CO2 photoreduction.As a consequence, in order to determine the specific surface areas of the asobtained samples, nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms were carried out.It can be found that the nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms of all the samples displayed type IV with a H3 hysteresis loops according to the Brunauer-Deming-Deming-Teller (BDDT) classification demonstrating that the asynthesized samples have mesoporous surface.Moreover, the BET specific surface area of 25AN is 63.8 m 2 /g, which is much higher than that of Ag2CrO4 (1.79 m 2 /g). The outcomes of photocatalytic performance assessments of the Ag2CrO4/NG/PI nano-composites (5AN-50AN), Ag2CrO4, Ag2CrO4/NG, Ag2CrO4/PI and NG/PI which were examined by the photoreduction of CO2 are presented in Fig. 9a.Carbon monoxide (CO), methanol (MeOH), methane (CH4), and ethanol (EtOH) were produced. Moreover, in the absence of light irradiation or diverse photocatalyst, the blank test was done which indicated that the products could be neglected.The rate of CO2 reduction was 10.0 molh -1 g cat -1 was demonstrated by pure NG. The achieved products were carbonmonoxide, methane, or methanol, and ethanol.(Actually from a theoretical point of view, other products including of hydrogen and oxygen should be observed because H2O was another reactant . It is noteworthy that the undetectability of the two products was due to two factors including the low sensitivity of the TCD detector and low concentration of them.)The diverse distribution of the achieved product using these photo assisted catalysts can mainly be ascribed to their varied conduction band positions.Due to the strong redox ability of the photogenerated electrons in NG, it can reduce CO2 to either MeOH or EtOH 62.Accordingly, no photocatalytic reduction of CO2 was acheived over the pure Ag2CrO4 catalyst.The separation efficiency of EHP and the ability of light absorption can be promoted by the deposition of Ag2CrO4 on NG leading to the enhancement of catalytic performance for photoreduction of CO2.A gradual increase in the photocatalytic activity of Ag2CrO4/NG/PI was observed with an increase of Ag2CrO4 concentration from 10 to 30 .Later on, excessive deposition of Ag2CrO4 could result in shielding of the active site on NG surfaces which subsequently leads to the catalytic efficiency reduction.Notably, the 25AN sample showed the highest rate of 68.32 molh -1 gcat -1 for CO2 reduction which was 6.8 times higher than of NG.Fig. 9a shows the comparable charts indicating photocatalytic conversion CO2 in presence of different samples.It is clearly observed that CO2 reduction has been significantly promoted from 10.0 to 68.32 molh -1 g cat -1 by doping of Ag2CrO4-NPs on NG.However, in comparison with 30AC, the photoactivity of Ag2CrO4/NG was still much lower which confirmed the superiority of the Ag2CrO4/NG/PI hetero-junction.The high photoactivity of the Ag2CrO4/NG/PI composites has been corroborated, albeit their stability in regard to practical applications was not evident.Consequently, a eight-run cycling reduction test has been performed in order to investigate about the stability of the optimal Ag2CrO4/NG/PI hybrid (25AN).Based on the results (Fig. 9b), after the decrease in the first four cycling runs, the CO2 conversion rate altered slightly indicating the stability of Ag2CrO4/NG/PI hybrids in the reaction.To gain further knowledge, the composites photoactivity under visible light irradiation (450 nm), besides their stability, was investigated.Based on the results a significant decrease up to 21.4 molh -1 gcat -1 was observed for the CO2 conversion rate of 25AN.However, in comparison with the activity of NG (10.0 molh -1 gcat -1 ), the promotion effect of Ag2CrO4 was still apparent.As previously been noticed, both the decreased light intensity and the limited absorbed light could be responsible for the reduced photoactivity under visible light 63.The effectiveness of utilizing light of shorter wavelength (255 nm) in irradiation in comparison with 350 nm for CO2 photoreduction by titanium oxide has been delineated 63.However, the low photocataltyic activity under visible light offered challenges for the promising reaction of photocatalytic CO2 reduction into fuels.Indeed, Ag2CrO4/NG/PI hybrid demonstrated great catalytic activity for RhB photodegradation.The RhB solution under visible light irradiation for 17 min could entirely be blanched in the presence of the 25AN sample, with a degradation rate of 0.24 min -1 , which was 6.3 times higher than those of NG and 3.7 times higher than those of Ag2CrO4. In general photo-assisted catalytic process have approved that two key factors including the absorption of light capacity and ability of EHPs separation improve the photocatalyst efficiency.meanwhile, in the case of the nanaocomposites such as Ag2CrO4/NG/PI high surface area is advantageous for the better performance as a photocatalyst for CO2 reduction.FE-SEM and AFM experiments has confirmed that the higher surface areas contribute to higher catalytic activities of Ag2CrO4/NG/PI nanocomposites.According to the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra, the addition of Ag2CrO4 could enhance the photoassisted catalytic function of NG, however, this could not demonstrate its high performance of photoactivity.Moreover, the photoluminescence spectra, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and photocurrent analysis, showed that the addition of Ag2CrO4 to NG could considerably increase the distance of EHPs, which, as previously reported, was based on the high photoassisted catalytic performance of Ag/graphene based nano composites 646566.The silver ions should exhibit its important role in separation of EHPs since Ag -NPs were also constructed the nanocomposite 67686970.Nevertheless, the key role of the coupling effect of Ag2CrO4 and NG has been confirmed by photocatalytic results but an subject respecting the transfer route of the photoassisted charge transfer process in the system still remained.Therefore a doubletransmission mechanism can be suggested for photocatalytic performance of the Ag2CrO4/NG/PI 646566.This mechanism indicates that the photogenerated electron in the conduction band of NG would transfer to that of Ag2CrO4, while the holes amass on the valance band of NG.Therefore, the electron and holes were properly separated.Moreover, since the electrons in the conduction band of Ag2CrO4 and holes in the valance band of NG owned adequate redutive or oxidiative ability to decompose dye molecules, such a mechanism would function for dye photodassisted-decomposition.In the current case, however, the double-transmission system could not explicate the effectivness of Ag2CrO4/NG/PI in photoassisted-catalytic function on CO2 reduction.Thus, CO2 reduction can not be promoted by the addition of Ag2CrO4 to NG if the Ag2CrO4/NG/PI nanocomposites follow the double-transmission system.Ag2CrO4/Ag 0 , can be assumed to conform with a Z-scheme photocatalytic system 71, which brought on the belief that the Z-scheme photoassisted-catalytic mechanism probably works in the Ag2CrO4 /NG/PI composite since NG and Ag2CrO4 have same conduction and valance bands positions.Moreover, the similarity of the distances between these bands has an important role to follow Z-scheme photoassisted-catalytic mechanism.Probably Ag nanoparticles function as a charge conduction bridge to create the Ag2CrO4/NG/PI Z-scheme photoassistedcatalytic mechanism.Two simultaneous events happen in this phase first the photogenerated electrons in the Notably this form of charge transfer can elevate the EHPs distance and enable the electrons and holes to stay on the conduction band of NG and valence band of Ag2CrO4, respectively.These electrons, owing to the negative ECB of NG, with their strong reducibility can simply abate CO2 to CH4, CO, MeOH, and EtOH.The obtained result is congruent with the results in Fig. 4a.Photoassisted catalytic system of Ag2CrO4/NG/PI composite is shown in Fig. 5. In order to scrutinize the most important effective compounds in the oxidative photoassisted catalytic of RhB over the Ag2CrO4/NG/PI nanocomposites, the reactive species harvesting tests have been designed.These experiments are beneficial in concluding the charge transmission path in the composite 72,73.The photoassisted-catalytic process of 25AN with diverse quenchers is exhibited in Fig. S5.Remarkably, no obvious effect for IPA or Isopropanol as an OH60-62 quencher on the degradation rate of RhB has been observed.However, the introduction of benzoquinone (BQ, O2 -scavenger) 73,74 decreased the RhB decomposition rate from 0.2 min -1 to 0.02 and EDTA (h scavenger) introduction 74,75 decreased it to 0.11 min -1 , suggesting that O2 -and h were the most important effective species in the photoassisted-catalytic processes of Ag2CrO4/NG/PI nanocomposites.Also, the reactive species harvesting tests were done using the same procedure for the samples of Ag2CrO4and NG.The results (Fig. 8d) indicated that h was the foremost effective compounds in the RhB decomposition of Ag2CrO4, which was in line with the prior published articles 75 The result is admissible by bearing in mind that the conduction band potential of Ag2CrO4is much lower than the standard reduction ability of O2 -/O2,.Similar to Ag2CrO4/NG/PI, the foremost reactive species for pure NG are O2 -and h.Undoubtedly, the conduction band of NG the electron can be improved by electrons that reduces O2 to O 2 -in Ag2CrO4/NG/PI only when the electron and holes transfer by the Zscheme mechanism.If not, accumulation of the photo-excited electron on the conduction band of Ag2CrO4 leads to the controlling effective species of h, which is incongruent with the obtained results.The provided data in Fig. 8d confirm that efficient Ag2CrO4/NG/PI nanocomposites follow the photoassisted catalytic Z-scheme system.Under these circumstances, the photoassisted catalytic EH in the hybrides are segregated properly and hence an excellent photocatalytic activity is achieved.In the current study, the great effectiveness of photoassisted catalytic Z-scheme system is demonstrated, and a promising method or the photocatalytic abatement of CO2 to fuels, also, the environmental protection of air pollution utilizing photo-assisted catalytic approach is provided."}, {"llm generation": "Ag2CrO4/NG, PI/NG, Ag2CrO4/PI and Ag2CrO4/NG/PI", "source": "Succinctly, this investigation have successfully reported the fabrication and characterization of new nanaocomposite including of Ag2CrO4/NG, PI/NG, Ag2CrO4/PI and Ag2CrO4/NG/PI with diverse ratio of components (5-50 AN) that were applied as photocatalysts under Vis-light irradiation.", "context": "Succinctly, this investigation have successfully reported the fabrication and characterization of new nanaocomposite including of Ag2CrO4/NG, PI/NG, Ag2CrO4/PI and Ag2CrO4/NG/PI with diverse ratio of components (5-50 AN) that were applied as photocatalysts under Vis-light irradiation.The photo-assisted catalytic activity results of as synthesized compounds demonstrated that the optimal Ag2CrO4/NG/PI (25AN) is more active than others.The performance of Ag2CrO4/NG/PI as a ternary Z-scheme photo-assistedcatalyst was explained based on the E-H reconstruction of the conduction bond electrons of Ag2CrO4 and the valence bond holes of PI happened trough NG as a electron mediator with the purpose of the creation of further oxidative holes in the valence bond of Ag2CrO4 and more reactive O2 -in the conduction bond of PI.Ag2CrO4/NG/PI facilities a quick charge distance and transfer of photogenerated EHPs to generate a high efficient oxidative and reductive photocatalyst for reduction of CO2..Meanwhile, the quick transmission of photogenerated electrons from Ag2CrO4 to NG before Ag is changed to Ag 0 successfully showed the photo-corrosion of Ag2CrO4 and thus enhances the durability of the nanocomposite.The study will promote the investigations of Z-scheme photocatalysts system and improve the knowledge of the combined silver-nitrogen compounds with high performance catalytic activity under visible light condition and stability. spectroscopy were registered by employing an AC voltage of 10 mV amplitude in the frequency range of 100-10 -1 Hz in 0.01 M Na2SO4.It is noteworthy that for photocurrent (PC) tests, a 350 W Xenon lamp and Na2SO4 (0.1 M) were applied as a light source and as the electrolyte respectively. Fig.1 (a) and Fig.1 (b) present the XRD analysis of Ag2CrO4, NG, Ag2CrO4/PI, Ag2CrO4/NG, PI/NG and 25AN before and after degradation respectively.Herein, 25AN is selsected as a optimum catalyst for photo-assisted CO2 reduction.According to the (JCPDS Card No. 26-0952 45-47 of the bare Ag2CrO4, the Bragg diffraction peaks at 2 21.7 o , 31.1 o , 31.4 o , 32.3 o , 33.7 o , 39.3 o , 44.3 o , 45.4 o , 52.1 o , 55.8 o , 57.1 o and 61.9 o can be undoubtedly indexed to the (120), (031), (211), (002), (131), (122), (240), (222), (400), (242), (213) and (431) crystal planes of the Fig.3 a and b showed FE-SEM and TEM images of PI that demonstrated a vast exfoliate constructed by layer by layer structre.FE-SEM and TEM images of NG were shown in Fig.3c and d as rippling sheets.In addition, it was that showed C 1s, N 1s and O 1s indicative signals at 285.7eV, 397.4 eV and 531.8 eV, respectively.Fig.S3bdemonstrated two characteristic signals at 395.4 eV and 397.5 eV that can be assigned to pyridinic and graphitic nitrogen of NG respectively48,49.According to Fig.S3c, the C 1s peak of NG referred to C-C, CC, C-N, CO and O-CO bonds that appeared at 285.1, 286.0, 287.3, 288.2 and 290.5 eV, respectively50.The above observations can reveal that N2H4 reduced GO to graphene and nitrogen-doped graphene compound through decoration of nitrogen atoms on the graphene.XPS patterns of 25AN composite and Ag2CrO4 photocatalyst were presented in Fig.4.In Fig.4it can be found that 25AN contains of silver, chrome, oxygen, carbon and nitrogen atoms.In Fig.4ftwo characteristic signals can be observed at 367.0 eV and 372.5 eV matching to Ag 3d5/2 and Ag 3d3/2 respectively, that indicate the oxidation number of the silver ions is 1.Fig.4epresents a peak at 576.2 eV referred to the binding energy of Cr in Ag2CrO451.The peak of O 1s in Fig.4dis 531.6 eV and belonged to oxygen atoms in Ag2CrO452.Meanwhile, XRD pattern of C 1s of 25AN (Fig.4b), shows two signals at 284.5 and 288.1 eV, that can be referred to C-C/CC and O-CO bonds, respectively.The significant enhancement in the peak of O-CO at 288.2 eV confirms successful combination of PI in 25AN photocatalyst53.The comparison of Fig.4cwith Fig.S3b, shows negligible alteration in nirogen 1s signal.The above scrutiny can be referred to successful recombination of Ag2CrO4, NG and PI together. conduction band of Ag2CrO4 transfer to Ag 0 due to conduction band edges of Ag2CrO4 is more negative than the Fermi level of Ag 0 and second the holes in the valence band of NG transfer to Ag 0 and admix with the electrons.

In Fig. 2 c, it clearly observed that globular shaped Ag2CrO4 NPs are immobilized on NG and PI.XPS analysis probed the chemical composition of the as prepared nanocomposites that shown in Fig. S2 andS3.The XPS spectrum of NG was shown in Fig. S3a FT-IR spectra of the synthesized compounds (Fig. 5) confirm the achieved XRD results.FT-IR spectrum of Ag2CrO4, showed the strong and sharp band at 877 cm -1 that can be attributed to Cr-O stretching vibration in CrO4 2- 54.meanwhile, FT-IR spectrums of 5AN, 15AN, 35 AN and 50 AN were showed in Fig. S4 that reveals the structure of these compounds. FT-IR analysis of duplex and triplex compounds was performed to recognize the functional groups of the synthesized compounds.Fig. 5 shows FT-IR spectrum of NG shows a peaks at 1385 cm -1 that can be assigned to the vibrational mode of C-N bonds 55.Consequently this peak approves the doping of N on the graphene surface.Meanwhile, the FT-IR spectrum of PI, contains several bands at 1376, 1725, 1772, and 725 cm -1 that can be attributed to the carbonnitrogen stretching mode, asymmetric stretching, symmetrical stretching and bending modes of the imidic ring absorption peak 56.The similarity of Ag2CrO4 signal intensities in FT-IR spectrum of duplex and triplex nanocatalysts confirms the XRD results.The electronic properties of the synthesized compounds (Ag2CrO4, Ag2CrO4/PI, Ag2CrO4/NG and 25AN) were investigated using UV-vis DRS.Fig. 6 showed the UV-vis DRS of Ag2CrO4 that contains a broad signal at the range of 500-600 nm which can be attributed to Ag2CrO4.The UV-vis DRS of Ag2CrO4/PI, Ag2CrO4/NG and 25AN nanocomposites show higher intensities peculiarly in UV region.The UV-vis DRS absorption peaks are more intense than Ag2CrO4 at the 400-800 nm except that Ag2CrO4/PI is moderately decreased at the range of 450-800 nm.As expected, the absorption intensity 25AN is enhanced in the vis light.The enhanced intensity of UV-vis DRS absorption of the synthesized compounds can be assigned to two reducing agents including of grephenoxide and PI that reduces the reflection of light.Hence, it can be found that the presence of NG and PI would simplify the improvement of vis-absorbance and also facilitate the chare separation phenomena in the nanocomposites toward the light, leads to improvement of photo-assisted catalytic efficiency.Fig. 6b presents the valence band energy of the compounds that was acheived by the Kubelka-Munk formula.The band gap of PI, Ag2CrO4 and 25AN composite photocatalysts are 2.78eV, 1.72 eV, 1.08 eV, respectively.Accord with the obtained data, the combination of Ag2CrO4, NG and PI resulted in decreasing the band gap of the photocatalyst, and increasing the UV-vis DRS absorption region of Ag2CrO4. The photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra of Ag2CrO4, Ag2CrO4/PI, Ag2CrO4/NG and 25AN composites were exhibited in Fig. 7a.The characteristic peak of these photocatalysts appears at 534 nm.As shown in Fig. 7a the photoluminescence intensity directly relates to the reconstruction of EHPs.Compared with bare Ag2CrO4, the PL intensity of Ag2CrO4-based catalyst is clearly quenched, that demonstrates that the combination of NG and PI can impressively affect on the charge separation of the compounds which resulted in the enhancement of photo-assisted catalytic performance.Fig. 7b showed that the initial photocurrent density of Ag2CrO4 was 0.8Acm -2 , but its photocurrent density decayed rapidly and decreased to 0.3 Acm -2 after 500 s, which indicates that Ag2CrO4 was unstable under visible light (420nm).The photocurrent density of PI was 0.15Acm -2 , and it was still stable under visible light within 500s. The photocurrent density of 25AN composites was 2Acm -2 , which was 2.5 times that of Ag2CrO4 and far exceeded the sum of Ag2CrO4 and PI.It suggests that there was a synergistic effect between Ag2CrO4 and PI to significantly enhance the photoelectric response intensity and effectively inhibit the photo-corrosion.It was also observed that the photoluminescence intensity of 25AN (Fig. 6) was weakened due to the introduction of PI and NG to increase the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs caused by the charge transport between Ag2CrO4 and PI, thereby improving the photocatalytic performance of 25AN.EIS is a powerful tool for studying a material's electrochemical conductivity properties.The EIS Nyquist plots of the materials shown in Fig. 7c andd were measured in the frequency range of 106-0.1 Hz with amplitude of 5 mV at a bias potential of 0 V versus Ag/AgCl.The impedance of the EIS Nyquist plots is the impedance of the catalyst, catalyst/electrolyte and catalyst/catalyst interface.The lower the impedance is, the higher the efficiency of the photogenerated carrier separation and the lower the interface resistance are.The minimum interfacial impedance (50) of 25AN composite implies that the composite has better electron transport capability and higher photogenerated carrier separation efficiency than Ag2CrO4 or PI alone 57,58.From the above photoelectrochemical analysis, it can be deduced that the photocatalytic activity and stability of 25AN composite are derived from its stable and efficient photoelectric conversion property, excellent photogenerated carrier separation efficiency and electron transport capability. Raman spectroscopy as a powerful and non-destructive method has been widely applied to characterize the structure and electronic properties of carbon materials, such as NG.Fig. 8 shows typical Raman spectra of NG and 25AN.This Fig presents two intense Raman features, which are assigned to G (1581 cm -1 ) and 2D (2674 cm -1 ) peaks 59.In addition to these two peaks, NG and 25AN present a strong D peak located at 1344 cm -1 , which is activated by defects, i.e., in-plane substitution heteroatoms, vacancies, or grain boundaries/ edges 60, through an intervalley double resonance Raman process.The appearance of D peak in NG (ID/IG 1.25) and 25AN (ID/IG 1.3) indicates that there are similar numbers of defects in these two samples, due to the substitution of nitrogen dopants and the introduction of vacancies during ion bombardment.An additional peak located at 1620 cm -1 (D0 peak) is also observed for NG and 25AN, which originates from the intravalley double resonance scattering process 60.However, the D0 peak of NG is more prominent compared to that of DG; in the other words, ID/ID0 is smaller for NG with similar amount of defects.This is related to different natures of defects in NG and 25AN It is well known that the BET specific surface area is commonly considered as an important influencing factor of the photocatalytic performance of photocatalyst.Generally, photocatalytic degradation is an interfacial reaction, a large BET specific surface area can provide more adsorption sites for CO2 photoreduction due to the adsorption of CO2 on the surface of photocatalyst is usually considered as the initial step in the decomposition of CO2, so increasing the contact opportunities between CO2 and photocatalyst, finally achieving excellent CO2 photoreduction.As a consequence, in order to determine the specific surface areas of the asobtained samples, nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms were carried out.It can be found that the nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms of all the samples displayed type IV with a H3 hysteresis loops according to the Brunauer-Deming-Deming-Teller (BDDT) classification demonstrating that the asynthesized samples have mesoporous surface.Moreover, the BET specific surface area of 25AN is 63.8 m 2 /g, which is much higher than that of Ag2CrO4 (1.79 m 2 /g). The outcomes of photocatalytic performance assessments of the Ag2CrO4/NG/PI nano-composites (5AN-50AN), Ag2CrO4, Ag2CrO4/NG, Ag2CrO4/PI and NG/PI which were examined by the photoreduction of CO2 are presented in Fig. 9a.Carbon monoxide (CO), methanol (MeOH), methane (CH4), and ethanol (EtOH) were produced. Moreover, in the absence of light irradiation or diverse photocatalyst, the blank test was done which indicated that the products could be neglected.The rate of CO2 reduction was 10.0 molh -1 g cat -1 was demonstrated by pure NG. The achieved products were carbonmonoxide, methane, or methanol, and ethanol.(Actually from a theoretical point of view, other products including of hydrogen and oxygen should be observed because H2O was another reactant . It is noteworthy that the undetectability of the two products was due to two factors including the low sensitivity of the TCD detector and low concentration of them.)The diverse distribution of the achieved product using these photo assisted catalysts can mainly be ascribed to their varied conduction band positions.Due to the strong redox ability of the photogenerated electrons in NG, it can reduce CO2 to either MeOH or EtOH 62.Accordingly, no photocatalytic reduction of CO2 was acheived over the pure Ag2CrO4 catalyst.The separation efficiency of EHP and the ability of light absorption can be promoted by the deposition of Ag2CrO4 on NG leading to the enhancement of catalytic performance for photoreduction of CO2.A gradual increase in the photocatalytic activity of Ag2CrO4/NG/PI was observed with an increase of Ag2CrO4 concentration from 10 to 30 .Later on, excessive deposition of Ag2CrO4 could result in shielding of the active site on NG surfaces which subsequently leads to the catalytic efficiency reduction.Notably, the 25AN sample showed the highest rate of 68.32 molh -1 gcat -1 for CO2 reduction which was 6.8 times higher than of NG.Fig. 9a shows the comparable charts indicating photocatalytic conversion CO2 in presence of different samples.It is clearly observed that CO2 reduction has been significantly promoted from 10.0 to 68.32 molh -1 g cat -1 by doping of Ag2CrO4-NPs on NG.However, in comparison with 30AC, the photoactivity of Ag2CrO4/NG was still much lower which confirmed the superiority of the Ag2CrO4/NG/PI hetero-junction.The high photoactivity of the Ag2CrO4/NG/PI composites has been corroborated, albeit their stability in regard to practical applications was not evident.Consequently, a eight-run cycling reduction test has been performed in order to investigate about the stability of the optimal Ag2CrO4/NG/PI hybrid (25AN).Based on the results (Fig. 9b), after the decrease in the first four cycling runs, the CO2 conversion rate altered slightly indicating the stability of Ag2CrO4/NG/PI hybrids in the reaction.To gain further knowledge, the composites photoactivity under visible light irradiation (450 nm), besides their stability, was investigated.Based on the results a significant decrease up to 21.4 molh -1 gcat -1 was observed for the CO2 conversion rate of 25AN.However, in comparison with the activity of NG (10.0 molh -1 gcat -1 ), the promotion effect of Ag2CrO4 was still apparent.As previously been noticed, both the decreased light intensity and the limited absorbed light could be responsible for the reduced photoactivity under visible light 63.The effectiveness of utilizing light of shorter wavelength (255 nm) in irradiation in comparison with 350 nm for CO2 photoreduction by titanium oxide has been delineated 63.However, the low photocataltyic activity under visible light offered challenges for the promising reaction of photocatalytic CO2 reduction into fuels.Indeed, Ag2CrO4/NG/PI hybrid demonstrated great catalytic activity for RhB photodegradation.The RhB solution under visible light irradiation for 17 min could entirely be blanched in the presence of the 25AN sample, with a degradation rate of 0.24 min -1 , which was 6.3 times higher than those of NG and 3.7 times higher than those of Ag2CrO4. In general photo-assisted catalytic process have approved that two key factors including the absorption of light capacity and ability of EHPs separation improve the photocatalyst efficiency.meanwhile, in the case of the nanaocomposites such as Ag2CrO4/NG/PI high surface area is advantageous for the better performance as a photocatalyst for CO2 reduction.FE-SEM and AFM experiments has confirmed that the higher surface areas contribute to higher catalytic activities of Ag2CrO4/NG/PI nanocomposites.According to the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra, the addition of Ag2CrO4 could enhance the photoassisted catalytic function of NG, however, this could not demonstrate its high performance of photoactivity.Moreover, the photoluminescence spectra, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and photocurrent analysis, showed that the addition of Ag2CrO4 to NG could considerably increase the distance of EHPs, which, as previously reported, was based on the high photoassisted catalytic performance of Ag/graphene based nano composites 646566.The silver ions should exhibit its important role in separation of EHPs since Ag -NPs were also constructed the nanocomposite 67686970.Nevertheless, the key role of the coupling effect of Ag2CrO4 and NG has been confirmed by photocatalytic results but an subject respecting the transfer route of the photoassisted charge transfer process in the system still remained.Therefore a doubletransmission mechanism can be suggested for photocatalytic performance of the Ag2CrO4/NG/PI 646566.This mechanism indicates that the photogenerated electron in the conduction band of NG would transfer to that of Ag2CrO4, while the holes amass on the valance band of NG.Therefore, the electron and holes were properly separated.Moreover, since the electrons in the conduction band of Ag2CrO4 and holes in the valance band of NG owned adequate redutive or oxidiative ability to decompose dye molecules, such a mechanism would function for dye photodassisted-decomposition.In the current case, however, the double-transmission system could not explicate the effectivness of Ag2CrO4/NG/PI in photoassisted-catalytic function on CO2 reduction.Thus, CO2 reduction can not be promoted by the addition of Ag2CrO4 to NG if the Ag2CrO4/NG/PI nanocomposites follow the double-transmission system.Ag2CrO4/Ag 0 , can be assumed to conform with a Z-scheme photocatalytic system 71, which brought on the belief that the Z-scheme photoassisted-catalytic mechanism probably works in the Ag2CrO4 /NG/PI composite since NG and Ag2CrO4 have same conduction and valance bands positions.Moreover, the similarity of the distances between these bands has an important role to follow Z-scheme photoassisted-catalytic mechanism.Probably Ag nanoparticles function as a charge conduction bridge to create the Ag2CrO4/NG/PI Z-scheme photoassistedcatalytic mechanism.Two simultaneous events happen in this phase first the photogenerated electrons in the Notably this form of charge transfer can elevate the EHPs distance and enable the electrons and holes to stay on the conduction band of NG and valence band of Ag2CrO4, respectively.These electrons, owing to the negative ECB of NG, with their strong reducibility can simply abate CO2 to CH4, CO, MeOH, and EtOH.The obtained result is congruent with the results in Fig. 4a.Photoassisted catalytic system of Ag2CrO4/NG/PI composite is shown in Fig. 5. In order to scrutinize the most important effective compounds in the oxidative photoassisted catalytic of RhB over the Ag2CrO4/NG/PI nanocomposites, the reactive species harvesting tests have been designed.These experiments are beneficial in concluding the charge transmission path in the composite 72,73.The photoassisted-catalytic process of 25AN with diverse quenchers is exhibited in Fig. S5.Remarkably, no obvious effect for IPA or Isopropanol as an OH60-62 quencher on the degradation rate of RhB has been observed.However, the introduction of benzoquinone (BQ, O2 -scavenger) 73,74 decreased the RhB decomposition rate from 0.2 min -1 to 0.02 and EDTA (h scavenger) introduction 74,75 decreased it to 0.11 min -1 , suggesting that O2 -and h were the most important effective species in the photoassisted-catalytic processes of Ag2CrO4/NG/PI nanocomposites.Also, the reactive species harvesting tests were done using the same procedure for the samples of Ag2CrO4and NG.The results (Fig. 8d) indicated that h was the foremost effective compounds in the RhB decomposition of Ag2CrO4, which was in line with the prior published articles 75 The result is admissible by bearing in mind that the conduction band potential of Ag2CrO4is much lower than the standard reduction ability of O2 -/O2,.Similar to Ag2CrO4/NG/PI, the foremost reactive species for pure NG are O2 -and h.Undoubtedly, the conduction band of NG the electron can be improved by electrons that reduces O2 to O 2 -in Ag2CrO4/NG/PI only when the electron and holes transfer by the Zscheme mechanism.If not, accumulation of the photo-excited electron on the conduction band of Ag2CrO4 leads to the controlling effective species of h, which is incongruent with the obtained results.The provided data in Fig. 8d confirm that efficient Ag2CrO4/NG/PI nanocomposites follow the photoassisted catalytic Z-scheme system.Under these circumstances, the photoassisted catalytic EH in the hybrides are segregated properly and hence an excellent photocatalytic activity is achieved.In the current study, the great effectiveness of photoassisted catalytic Z-scheme system is demonstrated, and a promising method or the photocatalytic abatement of CO2 to fuels, also, the environmental protection of air pollution utilizing photo-assisted catalytic approach is provided."}], "light source": [{"llm generation": "sunlight", "source": "The evaluation of photocatalytic potentiality of the synthesized composites (Ag2CrO4/NG, PI/NG, Ag2CrO4/PI and Ag2CrO4/NG/PI (5-5-AN)) was performed for the conversion of CO2 to different range of fuels under sunlight irradiation condition.", "context": "AgNO3 5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO), disodium elhylenediaminetetraacetic (EDTA-2Na), Polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG-400), dipotassium chromate (K2CrO4) and benzoquinone (BQ) were purchased from Merck Co.

Dispersion of synthetic solution was performed using an Ultrasonic Homogenizer (UHP-400, made in Ultrasonic Technology Development company-Iran).The structural characterization was performed using a X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) diffractometer (Philips PW-1840, Holland) with Cu-K radiation (1.54A), at a scanning speed of 2/min from 20 to 75(2).The functional groups of the samples were identified by FT-IR (400-4000 cm -region) and XPS analysis using a 8300 FT-IR Shimadzu spectrophotometer and XPS, ESCALab250Xi respectively.FE-SEM and TEM images were taken for the morphological characterization of the synthesized samples using a TEM, JEM-2100HR and FE-SEM, HITACHI S-4160 (30KV) respectively.The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of the photocatalysts were recorded using a UV-2600 UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-2600) in the range of 200-800nm.Shimadzu UV-2600 was equipped with an integrating sphere, and barium sulfate was applied as a standard.photoluminescence spectra (PL spectra) were recorded by a fluorescence spectrophotometer (F-2700 Hitachi, Japan) using a Xe lamp (260nm). 100 mL of 0.01 mol/L AgNO3 solution was mixed with 100 mL 10 gL -1 polyethylene glycol 400 and sonicated for 5 min.100mL 0.05 molL -1 K2CrO4 solution was added gradually.After stirring for 2 h, the achieved Ag2CrO4 precipitate was collected, washed with ethanol and DI water and finally dried in vacuum oven at 70C for 12 h.NG was synthesized according to the hydrazine steaming process 40.summarily, Hummers' method was applied for preparing of GO in the presence of 10 mL 60 N2H4, at 100C for 4 h.Finally, NG was collected and dried for 12 h.For synthesis of PI, 2.5 g MA and 4.36 g PMDA 41424344 were mixed and posited in an ultrasonic bath, raised to 325C at a rate of 7Cmin -1 for 3 h.The obtained sediment was collected, washed and dried AT 70 C for 10 h. Ag2CrO4/NG was synthesized by adding of NG (1 g) to a 10 mL of ethanol in 100 Ml baker and then Ag2CrO4 was added into baker.The achieved solution was sonicated for 2 and stirred for 6 h.The final product (Ag2CrO4/NG) was dried in a vacuum oven at 60C for 12 h.PI/NG and Ag2CrO4/PI were all synthesized by the explained method.To prepare of Ag2CrO4/NG/PI photocatalysts, PI/NG powder (0.20 g) and different amounts of Ag2CrO4 (with distinct molar ratios) were mixed in 100 mL of DI water, sonicated for 20 min and stirred for 6 h continuously.the acheived sediment was Xe-irradiated during 45 min.Then it was centrifugated, washed with distilled water, and dried in a vacuum oven at 65 o C for 24 h.In this procedure, various molar ratios of the Ag2CrO4 to NG/PI (i.e. 5 , 15, 25, 35, and 50 Ag2CrO4 to NG/PI), were obtained and denoted as 5AN, 15AN, 25AN, 35AN, and 50AN, respectively. The evaluation of photocatalytic potentiality of the synthesized composites (Ag2CrO4/NG, PI/NG, Ag2CrO4/PI and Ag2CrO4/NG/PI (5-5-AN)) was performed for the conversion of CO2 to different range of fuels under sunlight irradiation condition.In a photocatalytic reactor, the photocatalytic experiments were performed as it is shown in Fig. The amount considered for the catalyst was 10 mg and 4 mL deionized water was poured into the bottom of the reactor.A 500 W Xenon lamp was applied as the light source.The estimated light intensity at the position of catalyst was 180 mW/cm 2 and a decrease in the light intensity to about 105 mW/cm 2 was observed after the use of UV cutoff filter (400 nm).The light irradiation was preceded by the purge of the above system with CO2 for ten times.The CO2 pressure and the photoreaction temperature were kept to be 0.4 MPa and 80 o C respectively.The analysis of the gas product after light irradiation for 4 h has been carried out by a SRI 8610C gas chromatograph which was equipped with the columns of 6' HAYESEP-D ,6' MS-13X, and 60M MXT-1 in two FID detectors and one TCD detector.Under the irradiation of a 350 W Xenon lamp the photocatalytic degradation of RhB (10 mg/L) was performed whlie the UV and infrared light (400-800 were filtered by optical filters.The initial volume of RhB solution and the photocatalyst amount were 100 mL and 0.10 g respectively.Irradiation was preceded by the agitation of the mixture for 45 min to guarantee adsorption/desorption equilibrium at 27 C.In order to analyze the produced sediment it was centrifuged and seprated.The concentration of aqueous solution of RhB was measured at 554 nm. Additionally, photoactivity for RhB was determined in the absence of the photocatalyst.The photocatalyst was preceded by an introduction of a number of scavengers into the RhB solution.Based on the prior studies 42,43, the concentration of scavengers and benzoquinone was 10 -2 and 10 -4 M respectively.With a standard trinary -electrode system, electrochemical evaluations were performed at r.t..In this setup, Ag, AgCl and Pt wire were applied as the working, reference and counter electrodes.The provision of working electrodes based on the literature reported 44 was done in this way that first a 25.5 cm indium tin oxide (ITO) glass piece was sonicated in acetone, immersed in boiling sodium hydroxide (0.1 M), rinsed with deionized water and dried in an air stream afterwards.The ITO glass substrate was then coated by a suspension of 200 mg of the powder in 1 mL of ethanol.Subsequently, the coated glass was heated for 90 h at 180 C in air to help better adhesion.A copper wire was attached to the side part of the 031), ( 211), ( 002), ( 131), ( 122), ( 240), ( 222), (400), ( 242), ( 213) and (431) crystal planes of the orthorhombic.The noticeably strong and sharp peaks demonstrate that the Ag2CrO4 is well-crystalline, and unveiling that the pure orthorhombic Ag2CrO4 is composed during the mentioned procedure.Moreover the XRD patterns of 5 AN, 15 AN, 35 AN and 50 AN was showed in Fig. S2 that confirm the structure of the synthesized nanocomposites."}, {"llm generation": "Monochromatic (420nm)", "source": "Fig. 7b showed that the initial photocurrent density of Ag2CrO4 was 0.8Acm -2 , but its photocurrent density decayed rapidly and decreased to 0.3 Acm -2 after 500 s, which indicates that Ag2CrO4 was unstable under visible light (420nm).", "context": "The (211) crystal plane of Ag2CrO4 structure attributed to the diffraction peak at 231.4.It is mentioned that the XRD analysis of Ag2CrO4/PI, Ag2CrO4/NG and 25AN show the similar signals as bare Ag2CrO4, but the intensities of 25AN peaks are stronger than that of Ag2CrO4/PI and Ag2CrO4/NG.Therefore, the ternary nanocomposits is more impressive than the duplex compound to confirm the original crystal structure of Ag2CrO4 from being ruined.After decomposition the XRD pattern of the photocatalysts showed the corresponding peaks with reduced intensity, but they maintained basically unaffected, demonstrating the high resistance of the synthesized catalysts.The morphological properties of the synthesized compounds was studied by FE-SEM, TEM and AFM (Fig. 2 and3).3c andd as rippling sheets.In addition, it was clear that the Ag2CrO4 -NPs in the Ag2CrO4/PI (Fig. 3e) and Ag2CrO4/NG (Fig. 3f) are immobilized on the surfaces of PI and NG, respectively. In Fig. 2 c, it clearly observed that globular shaped Ag2CrO4 NPs are immobilized on NG and PI.XPS analysis probed the chemical composition of the as prepared nanocomposites that shown in Fig. S2 andS3.The XPS spectrum of NG was shown in Fig. S3a FT-IR spectra of the synthesized compounds (Fig. 5) confirm the achieved XRD results.FT-IR spectrum of Ag2CrO4, showed the strong and sharp band at 877 cm -1 that can be attributed to Cr-O stretching vibration in CrO4 2- 54.meanwhile, FT-IR spectrums of 5AN, 15AN, 35 AN and 50 AN were showed in Fig. S4 that reveals the structure of these compounds. FT-IR analysis of duplex and triplex compounds was performed to recognize the functional groups of the synthesized compounds.Fig. 5 shows FT-IR spectrum of NG shows a peaks at 1385 cm -1 that can be assigned to the vibrational mode of C-N bonds 55.Consequently this peak approves the doping of N on the graphene surface.Meanwhile, the FT-IR spectrum of PI, contains several bands at 1376, 1725, 1772, and 725 cm -1 that can be attributed to the carbonnitrogen stretching mode, asymmetric stretching, symmetrical stretching and bending modes of the imidic ring absorption peak 56.The similarity of Ag2CrO4 signal intensities in FT-IR spectrum of duplex and triplex nanocatalysts confirms the XRD results.The electronic properties of the synthesized compounds (Ag2CrO4, Ag2CrO4/PI, Ag2CrO4/NG and 25AN) were investigated using UV-vis DRS.Fig. 6 showed the UV-vis DRS of Ag2CrO4 that contains a broad signal at the range of 500-600 nm which can be attributed to Ag2CrO4.The UV-vis DRS of Ag2CrO4/PI, Ag2CrO4/NG and 25AN nanocomposites show higher intensities peculiarly in UV region.The UV-vis DRS absorption peaks are more intense than Ag2CrO4 at the 400-800 nm except that Ag2CrO4/PI is moderately decreased at the range of 450-800 nm.As expected, the absorption intensity 25AN is enhanced in the vis light.The enhanced intensity of UV-vis DRS absorption of the synthesized compounds can be assigned to two reducing agents including of grephenoxide and PI that reduces the reflection of light.Hence, it can be found that the presence of NG and PI would simplify the improvement of vis-absorbance and also facilitate the chare separation phenomena in the nanocomposites toward the light, leads to improvement of photo-assisted catalytic efficiency.Fig. 6b presents the valence band energy of the compounds that was acheived by the Kubelka-Munk formula.The band gap of PI, Ag2CrO4 and 25AN composite photocatalysts are 2.78eV, 1.72 eV, 1.08 eV, respectively.Accord with the obtained data, the combination of Ag2CrO4, NG and PI resulted in decreasing the band gap of the photocatalyst, and increasing the UV-vis DRS absorption region of Ag2CrO4. The photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra of Ag2CrO4, Ag2CrO4/PI, Ag2CrO4/NG and 25AN composites were exhibited in Fig. 7a.The characteristic peak of these photocatalysts appears at 534 nm.As shown in Fig. 7a the photoluminescence intensity directly relates to the reconstruction of EHPs.Compared with bare Ag2CrO4, the PL intensity of Ag2CrO4-based catalyst is clearly quenched, that demonstrates that the combination of NG and PI can impressively affect on the charge separation of the compounds which resulted in the enhancement of photo-assisted catalytic performance.Fig. 7b showed that the initial photocurrent density of Ag2CrO4 was 0.8Acm -2 , but its photocurrent density decayed rapidly and decreased to 0.3 Acm -2 after 500 s, which indicates that Ag2CrO4 was unstable under visible light (420nm).The photocurrent density of PI was 0.15Acm -2 , and it was still stable under visible light within 500s. The photocurrent density of 25AN composites was 2Acm -2 , which was 2.5 times that of Ag2CrO4 and far exceeded the sum of Ag2CrO4 and PI.It suggests that there was a synergistic effect between Ag2CrO4 and PI to significantly enhance the photoelectric response intensity and effectively inhibit the photo-corrosion.It was also observed that the photoluminescence intensity of 25AN (Fig. 6) was weakened due to the introduction of PI and NG to increase the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs caused by the charge transport between Ag2CrO4 and PI, thereby improving the photocatalytic performance of 25AN.EIS is a powerful tool for studying a material's electrochemical conductivity properties.The EIS Nyquist plots of the materials shown in Fig. 7c andd were measured in the frequency range of 106-0.1 Hz with amplitude of 5 mV at a bias potential of 0 V versus Ag/AgCl.The impedance of the EIS Nyquist plots is the impedance of the catalyst, catalyst/electrolyte and catalyst/catalyst interface.The lower the impedance is, the higher the efficiency of the photogenerated carrier separation and the lower the interface resistance are.The minimum interfacial impedance (50) of 25AN composite implies that the composite has better electron transport capability and higher photogenerated carrier separation efficiency than Ag2CrO4 or PI alone 57,58.From the above photoelectrochemical analysis, it can be deduced that the photocatalytic activity and stability of 25AN composite are derived from its stable and efficient photoelectric conversion property, excellent photogenerated carrier separation efficiency and electron transport capability. Raman spectroscopy as a powerful and non-destructive method has been widely applied to characterize the structure and electronic properties of carbon materials, such as NG.Fig. 8 shows typical Raman spectra of NG and 25AN.This Fig presents two intense Raman features, which are assigned to G (1581 cm -1 ) and 2D (2674 cm -1 ) peaks 59.In addition to these two peaks, NG and 25AN present a strong D peak located at 1344 cm -1 , which is activated by defects, i.e., in-plane substitution heteroatoms, vacancies, or grain boundaries/ edges 60, through an intervalley double resonance Raman process.The appearance of D peak in NG (ID/IG 1.25) and 25AN (ID/IG 1.3) indicates that there are similar numbers of defects in these two samples, due to the substitution of nitrogen dopants and the introduction of vacancies during ion bombardment.An additional peak located at 1620 cm -1 (D0 peak) is also observed for NG and 25AN, which originates from the intravalley double resonance scattering process 60.However, the D0 peak of NG is more prominent compared to that of DG; in the other words, ID/ID0 is smaller for NG with similar amount of defects.This is related to different natures of defects in NG and 25AN It is well known that the BET specific surface area is commonly considered as an important influencing factor of the photocatalytic performance of photocatalyst.Generally, photocatalytic degradation is an interfacial reaction, a large BET specific surface area can provide more adsorption sites for CO2 photoreduction due to the adsorption of CO2 on the surface of photocatalyst is usually considered as the initial step in the decomposition of CO2, so increasing the contact opportunities between CO2 and photocatalyst, finally achieving excellent CO2 photoreduction.As a consequence, in order to determine the specific surface areas of the asobtained samples, nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms were carried out.It can be found that the nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms of all the samples displayed type IV with a H3 hysteresis loops according to the Brunauer-Deming-Deming-Teller (BDDT) classification demonstrating that the asynthesized samples have mesoporous surface.Moreover, the BET specific surface area of 25AN is 63.8 m 2 /g, which is much higher than that of Ag2CrO4 (1.79 m 2 /g). The outcomes of photocatalytic performance assessments of the Ag2CrO4/NG/PI nano-composites (5AN-50AN), Ag2CrO4, Ag2CrO4/NG, Ag2CrO4/PI and NG/PI which were examined by the photoreduction of CO2 are presented in Fig. 9a.Carbon monoxide (CO), methanol (MeOH), methane (CH4), and ethanol (EtOH) were produced. Moreover, in the absence of light irradiation or diverse photocatalyst, the blank test was done which indicated that the products could be neglected.The rate of CO2 reduction was 10.0 molh -1 g cat -1 was demonstrated by pure NG. The achieved products were carbonmonoxide, methane, or methanol, and ethanol.(Actually from a theoretical point of view, other products including of hydrogen and oxygen should be observed because H2O was another reactant . It is noteworthy that the undetectability of the two products was due to two factors including the low sensitivity of the TCD detector and low concentration of them.)The diverse distribution of the achieved product using these photo assisted catalysts can mainly be ascribed to their varied conduction band positions.Due to the strong redox ability of the photogenerated electrons in NG, it can reduce CO2 to either MeOH or EtOH 62.Accordingly, no photocatalytic reduction of CO2 was acheived over the pure Ag2CrO4 catalyst.The separation efficiency of EHP and the ability of light absorption can be promoted by the deposition of Ag2CrO4 on NG leading to the enhancement of catalytic performance for photoreduction of CO2.A gradual increase in the photocatalytic activity of Ag2CrO4/NG/PI was observed with an increase of Ag2CrO4 concentration from 10 to 30 .Later on, excessive deposition of Ag2CrO4 could result in shielding of the active site on NG surfaces which subsequently leads to the catalytic efficiency reduction.Notably, the 25AN sample showed the highest rate of 68.32 molh -1 gcat -1 for CO2 reduction which was 6.8 times higher than of NG.Fig. 9a shows the comparable charts indicating photocatalytic conversion CO2 in presence of different samples.It is clearly observed that CO2 reduction has been significantly promoted from 10.0 to 68.32 molh -1 g cat -1 by doping of Ag2CrO4-NPs on NG.However, in comparison with 30AC, the photoactivity of Ag2CrO4/NG was still much lower which confirmed the superiority of the Ag2CrO4/NG/PI hetero-junction.The high photoactivity of the Ag2CrO4/NG/PI composites has been corroborated, albeit their stability in regard to practical applications was not evident.Consequently, a eight-run cycling reduction test has been performed in order to investigate about the stability of the optimal Ag2CrO4/NG/PI hybrid (25AN).Based on the results (Fig. 9b), after the decrease in the first four cycling runs, the CO2 conversion rate altered slightly indicating the stability of Ag2CrO4/NG/PI hybrids in the reaction.To gain further knowledge, the composites photoactivity under visible light irradiation (450 nm), besides their stability, was investigated.Based on the results a significant decrease up to 21.4 molh -1 gcat -1 was observed for the CO2 conversion rate of 25AN.However, in comparison with the activity of NG (10.0 molh -1 gcat -1 ), the promotion effect of Ag2CrO4 was still apparent.As previously been noticed, both the decreased light intensity and the limited absorbed light could be responsible for the reduced photoactivity under visible light 63.The effectiveness of utilizing light of shorter wavelength (255 nm) in irradiation in comparison with 350 nm for CO2 photoreduction by titanium oxide has been delineated 63.However, the low photocataltyic activity under visible light offered challenges for the promising reaction of photocatalytic CO2 reduction into fuels.Indeed, Ag2CrO4/NG/PI hybrid demonstrated great catalytic activity for RhB photodegradation.The RhB solution under visible light irradiation for 17 min could entirely be blanched in the presence of the 25AN sample, with a degradation rate of 0.24 min -1 , which was 6.3 times higher than those of NG and 3.7 times higher than those of Ag2CrO4. In general photo-assisted catalytic process have approved that two key factors including the absorption of light capacity and ability of EHPs separation improve the photocatalyst efficiency.meanwhile, in the case of the nanaocomposites such as Ag2CrO4/NG/PI high surface area is advantageous for the better performance as a photocatalyst for CO2 reduction.FE-SEM and AFM experiments has confirmed that the higher surface areas contribute to higher catalytic activities of Ag2CrO4/NG/PI nanocomposites.According to the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra, the addition of Ag2CrO4 could enhance the photoassisted catalytic function of NG, however, this could not demonstrate its high performance of photoactivity.Moreover, the photoluminescence spectra, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and photocurrent analysis, showed that the addition of Ag2CrO4 to NG could considerably increase the distance of EHPs, which, as previously reported, was based on the high photoassisted catalytic performance of Ag/graphene based nano composites 646566.The silver ions should exhibit its important role in separation of EHPs since Ag -NPs were also constructed the nanocomposite 67686970.Nevertheless, the key role of the coupling effect of Ag2CrO4 and NG has been confirmed by photocatalytic results but an subject respecting the transfer route of the photoassisted charge transfer process in the system still remained.Therefore a doubletransmission mechanism can be suggested for photocatalytic performance of the Ag2CrO4/NG/PI 646566.This mechanism indicates that the photogenerated electron in the conduction band of NG would transfer to that of Ag2CrO4, while the holes amass on the valance band of NG.Therefore, the electron and holes were properly separated.Moreover, since the electrons in the conduction band of Ag2CrO4 and holes in the valance band of NG owned adequate redutive or oxidiative ability to decompose dye molecules, such a mechanism would function for dye photodassisted-decomposition.In the current case, however, the double-transmission system could not explicate the effectivness of Ag2CrO4/NG/PI in photoassisted-catalytic function on CO2 reduction.Thus, CO2 reduction can not be promoted by the addition of Ag2CrO4 to NG if the Ag2CrO4/NG/PI nanocomposites follow the double-transmission system.Ag2CrO4/Ag 0 , can be assumed to conform with a Z-scheme photocatalytic system 71, which brought on the belief that the Z-scheme photoassisted-catalytic mechanism probably works in the Ag2CrO4 /NG/PI composite since NG and Ag2CrO4 have same conduction and valance bands positions.Moreover, the similarity of the distances between these bands has an important role to follow Z-scheme photoassisted-catalytic mechanism.Probably Ag nanoparticles function as a charge conduction bridge to create the Ag2CrO4/NG/PI Z-scheme photoassistedcatalytic mechanism.Two simultaneous events happen in this phase first the photogenerated electrons in the Notably this form of charge transfer can elevate the EHPs distance and enable the electrons and holes to stay on the conduction band of NG and valence band of Ag2CrO4, respectively.These electrons, owing to the negative ECB of NG, with their strong reducibility can simply abate CO2 to CH4, CO, MeOH, and EtOH.The obtained result is congruent with the results in Fig. 4a.Photoassisted catalytic system of Ag2CrO4/NG/PI composite is shown in Fig. 5. In order to scrutinize the most important effective compounds in the oxidative photoassisted catalytic of RhB over the Ag2CrO4/NG/PI nanocomposites, the reactive species harvesting tests have been designed.These experiments are beneficial in concluding the charge transmission path in the composite 72,73.The photoassisted-catalytic process of 25AN with diverse quenchers is exhibited in Fig. S5.Remarkably, no obvious effect for IPA or Isopropanol as an OH60-62 quencher on the degradation rate of RhB has been observed.However, the introduction of benzoquinone (BQ, O2 -scavenger) 73,74 decreased the RhB decomposition rate from 0.2 min -1 to 0.02 and EDTA (h scavenger) introduction 74,75 decreased it to 0.11 min -1 , suggesting that O2 -and h were the most important effective species in the photoassisted-catalytic processes of Ag2CrO4/NG/PI nanocomposites.Also, the reactive species harvesting tests were done using the same procedure for the samples of Ag2CrO4and NG.The results (Fig. 8d) indicated that h was the foremost effective compounds in the RhB decomposition of Ag2CrO4, which was in line with the prior published articles 75 The result is admissible by bearing in mind that the conduction band potential of Ag2CrO4is much lower than the standard reduction ability of O2 -/O2,.Similar to Ag2CrO4/NG/PI, the foremost reactive species for pure NG are O2 -and h.Undoubtedly, the conduction band of NG the electron can be improved by electrons that reduces O2 to O 2 -in Ag2CrO4/NG/PI only when the electron and holes transfer by the Zscheme mechanism.If not, accumulation of the photo-excited electron on the conduction band of Ag2CrO4 leads to the controlling effective species of h, which is incongruent with the obtained results.The provided data in Fig. 8d confirm that efficient Ag2CrO4/NG/PI nanocomposites follow the photoassisted catalytic Z-scheme system.Under these circumstances, the photoassisted catalytic EH in the hybrides are segregated properly and hence an excellent photocatalytic activity is achieved.In the current study, the great effectiveness of photoassisted catalytic Z-scheme system is demonstrated, and a promising method or the photocatalytic abatement of CO2 to fuels, also, the environmental protection of air pollution utilizing photo-assisted catalytic approach is provided."}, {"llm generation": "Monochromatic (450 nm)", "source": "To gain further knowledge, the composites photoactivity under visible light irradiation (450 nm), besides their stability, was investigated.", "context": "The (211) crystal plane of Ag2CrO4 structure attributed to the diffraction peak at 231.4.It is mentioned that the XRD analysis of Ag2CrO4/PI, Ag2CrO4/NG and 25AN show the similar signals as bare Ag2CrO4, but the intensities of 25AN peaks are stronger than that of Ag2CrO4/PI and Ag2CrO4/NG.Therefore, the ternary nanocomposits is more impressive than the duplex compound to confirm the original crystal structure of Ag2CrO4 from being ruined.After decomposition the XRD pattern of the photocatalysts showed the corresponding peaks with reduced intensity, but they maintained basically unaffected, demonstrating the high resistance of the synthesized catalysts.The morphological properties of the synthesized compounds was studied by FE-SEM, TEM and AFM (Fig. 2 and3).3c andd as rippling sheets.In addition, it was clear that the Ag2CrO4 -NPs in the Ag2CrO4/PI (Fig. 3e) and Ag2CrO4/NG (Fig. 3f) are immobilized on the surfaces of PI and NG, respectively. In Fig. 2 c, it clearly observed that globular shaped Ag2CrO4 NPs are immobilized on NG and PI.XPS analysis probed the chemical composition of the as prepared nanocomposites that shown in Fig. S2 andS3.The XPS spectrum of NG was shown in Fig. S3a FT-IR spectra of the synthesized compounds (Fig. 5) confirm the achieved XRD results.FT-IR spectrum of Ag2CrO4, showed the strong and sharp band at 877 cm -1 that can be attributed to Cr-O stretching vibration in CrO4 2- 54.meanwhile, FT-IR spectrums of 5AN, 15AN, 35 AN and 50 AN were showed in Fig. S4 that reveals the structure of these compounds. FT-IR analysis of duplex and triplex compounds was performed to recognize the functional groups of the synthesized compounds.Fig. 5 shows FT-IR spectrum of NG shows a peaks at 1385 cm -1 that can be assigned to the vibrational mode of C-N bonds 55.Consequently this peak approves the doping of N on the graphene surface.Meanwhile, the FT-IR spectrum of PI, contains several bands at 1376, 1725, 1772, and 725 cm -1 that can be attributed to the carbonnitrogen stretching mode, asymmetric stretching, symmetrical stretching and bending modes of the imidic ring absorption peak 56.The similarity of Ag2CrO4 signal intensities in FT-IR spectrum of duplex and triplex nanocatalysts confirms the XRD results.The electronic properties of the synthesized compounds (Ag2CrO4, Ag2CrO4/PI, Ag2CrO4/NG and 25AN) were investigated using UV-vis DRS.Fig. 6 showed the UV-vis DRS of Ag2CrO4 that contains a broad signal at the range of 500-600 nm which can be attributed to Ag2CrO4.The UV-vis DRS of Ag2CrO4/PI, Ag2CrO4/NG and 25AN nanocomposites show higher intensities peculiarly in UV region.The UV-vis DRS absorption peaks are more intense than Ag2CrO4 at the 400-800 nm except that Ag2CrO4/PI is moderately decreased at the range of 450-800 nm.As expected, the absorption intensity 25AN is enhanced in the vis light.The enhanced intensity of UV-vis DRS absorption of the synthesized compounds can be assigned to two reducing agents including of grephenoxide and PI that reduces the reflection of light.Hence, it can be found that the presence of NG and PI would simplify the improvement of vis-absorbance and also facilitate the chare separation phenomena in the nanocomposites toward the light, leads to improvement of photo-assisted catalytic efficiency.Fig. 6b presents the valence band energy of the compounds that was acheived by the Kubelka-Munk formula.The band gap of PI, Ag2CrO4 and 25AN composite photocatalysts are 2.78eV, 1.72 eV, 1.08 eV, respectively.Accord with the obtained data, the combination of Ag2CrO4, NG and PI resulted in decreasing the band gap of the photocatalyst, and increasing the UV-vis DRS absorption region of Ag2CrO4. The photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra of Ag2CrO4, Ag2CrO4/PI, Ag2CrO4/NG and 25AN composites were exhibited in Fig. 7a.The characteristic peak of these photocatalysts appears at 534 nm.As shown in Fig. 7a the photoluminescence intensity directly relates to the reconstruction of EHPs.Compared with bare Ag2CrO4, the PL intensity of Ag2CrO4-based catalyst is clearly quenched, that demonstrates that the combination of NG and PI can impressively affect on the charge separation of the compounds which resulted in the enhancement of photo-assisted catalytic performance.Fig. 7b showed that the initial photocurrent density of Ag2CrO4 was 0.8Acm -2 , but its photocurrent density decayed rapidly and decreased to 0.3 Acm -2 after 500 s, which indicates that Ag2CrO4 was unstable under visible light (420nm).The photocurrent density of PI was 0.15Acm -2 , and it was still stable under visible light within 500s. The photocurrent density of 25AN composites was 2Acm -2 , which was 2.5 times that of Ag2CrO4 and far exceeded the sum of Ag2CrO4 and PI.It suggests that there was a synergistic effect between Ag2CrO4 and PI to significantly enhance the photoelectric response intensity and effectively inhibit the photo-corrosion.It was also observed that the photoluminescence intensity of 25AN (Fig. 6) was weakened due to the introduction of PI and NG to increase the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs caused by the charge transport between Ag2CrO4 and PI, thereby improving the photocatalytic performance of 25AN.EIS is a powerful tool for studying a material's electrochemical conductivity properties.The EIS Nyquist plots of the materials shown in Fig. 7c andd were measured in the frequency range of 106-0.1 Hz with amplitude of 5 mV at a bias potential of 0 V versus Ag/AgCl.The impedance of the EIS Nyquist plots is the impedance of the catalyst, catalyst/electrolyte and catalyst/catalyst interface.The lower the impedance is, the higher the efficiency of the photogenerated carrier separation and the lower the interface resistance are.The minimum interfacial impedance (50) of 25AN composite implies that the composite has better electron transport capability and higher photogenerated carrier separation efficiency than Ag2CrO4 or PI alone 57,58.From the above photoelectrochemical analysis, it can be deduced that the photocatalytic activity and stability of 25AN composite are derived from its stable and efficient photoelectric conversion property, excellent photogenerated carrier separation efficiency and electron transport capability. Raman spectroscopy as a powerful and non-destructive method has been widely applied to characterize the structure and electronic properties of carbon materials, such as NG.Fig. 8 shows typical Raman spectra of NG and 25AN.This Fig presents two intense Raman features, which are assigned to G (1581 cm -1 ) and 2D (2674 cm -1 ) peaks 59.In addition to these two peaks, NG and 25AN present a strong D peak located at 1344 cm -1 , which is activated by defects, i.e., in-plane substitution heteroatoms, vacancies, or grain boundaries/ edges 60, through an intervalley double resonance Raman process.The appearance of D peak in NG (ID/IG 1.25) and 25AN (ID/IG 1.3) indicates that there are similar numbers of defects in these two samples, due to the substitution of nitrogen dopants and the introduction of vacancies during ion bombardment.An additional peak located at 1620 cm -1 (D0 peak) is also observed for NG and 25AN, which originates from the intravalley double resonance scattering process 60.However, the D0 peak of NG is more prominent compared to that of DG; in the other words, ID/ID0 is smaller for NG with similar amount of defects.This is related to different natures of defects in NG and 25AN It is well known that the BET specific surface area is commonly considered as an important influencing factor of the photocatalytic performance of photocatalyst.Generally, photocatalytic degradation is an interfacial reaction, a large BET specific surface area can provide more adsorption sites for CO2 photoreduction due to the adsorption of CO2 on the surface of photocatalyst is usually considered as the initial step in the decomposition of CO2, so increasing the contact opportunities between CO2 and photocatalyst, finally achieving excellent CO2 photoreduction.As a consequence, in order to determine the specific surface areas of the asobtained samples, nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms were carried out.It can be found that the nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms of all the samples displayed type IV with a H3 hysteresis loops according to the Brunauer-Deming-Deming-Teller (BDDT) classification demonstrating that the asynthesized samples have mesoporous surface.Moreover, the BET specific surface area of 25AN is 63.8 m 2 /g, which is much higher than that of Ag2CrO4 (1.79 m 2 /g). The outcomes of photocatalytic performance assessments of the Ag2CrO4/NG/PI nano-composites (5AN-50AN), Ag2CrO4, Ag2CrO4/NG, Ag2CrO4/PI and NG/PI which were examined by the photoreduction of CO2 are presented in Fig. 9a.Carbon monoxide (CO), methanol (MeOH), methane (CH4), and ethanol (EtOH) were produced. Moreover, in the absence of light irradiation or diverse photocatalyst, the blank test was done which indicated that the products could be neglected.The rate of CO2 reduction was 10.0 molh -1 g cat -1 was demonstrated by pure NG. The achieved products were carbonmonoxide, methane, or methanol, and ethanol.(Actually from a theoretical point of view, other products including of hydrogen and oxygen should be observed because H2O was another reactant . It is noteworthy that the undetectability of the two products was due to two factors including the low sensitivity of the TCD detector and low concentration of them.)The diverse distribution of the achieved product using these photo assisted catalysts can mainly be ascribed to their varied conduction band positions.Due to the strong redox ability of the photogenerated electrons in NG, it can reduce CO2 to either MeOH or EtOH 62.Accordingly, no photocatalytic reduction of CO2 was acheived over the pure Ag2CrO4 catalyst.The separation efficiency of EHP and the ability of light absorption can be promoted by the deposition of Ag2CrO4 on NG leading to the enhancement of catalytic performance for photoreduction of CO2.A gradual increase in the photocatalytic activity of Ag2CrO4/NG/PI was observed with an increase of Ag2CrO4 concentration from 10 to 30 .Later on, excessive deposition of Ag2CrO4 could result in shielding of the active site on NG surfaces which subsequently leads to the catalytic efficiency reduction.Notably, the 25AN sample showed the highest rate of 68.32 molh -1 gcat -1 for CO2 reduction which was 6.8 times higher than of NG.Fig. 9a shows the comparable charts indicating photocatalytic conversion CO2 in presence of different samples.It is clearly observed that CO2 reduction has been significantly promoted from 10.0 to 68.32 molh -1 g cat -1 by doping of Ag2CrO4-NPs on NG.However, in comparison with 30AC, the photoactivity of Ag2CrO4/NG was still much lower which confirmed the superiority of the Ag2CrO4/NG/PI hetero-junction.The high photoactivity of the Ag2CrO4/NG/PI composites has been corroborated, albeit their stability in regard to practical applications was not evident.Consequently, a eight-run cycling reduction test has been performed in order to investigate about the stability of the optimal Ag2CrO4/NG/PI hybrid (25AN).Based on the results (Fig. 9b), after the decrease in the first four cycling runs, the CO2 conversion rate altered slightly indicating the stability of Ag2CrO4/NG/PI hybrids in the reaction.To gain further knowledge, the composites photoactivity under visible light irradiation (450 nm), besides their stability, was investigated.Based on the results a significant decrease up to 21.4 molh -1 gcat -1 was observed for the CO2 conversion rate of 25AN.However, in comparison with the activity of NG (10.0 molh -1 gcat -1 ), the promotion effect of Ag2CrO4 was still apparent.As previously been noticed, both the decreased light intensity and the limited absorbed light could be responsible for the reduced photoactivity under visible light 63.The effectiveness of utilizing light of shorter wavelength (255 nm) in irradiation in comparison with 350 nm for CO2 photoreduction by titanium oxide has been delineated 63.However, the low photocataltyic activity under visible light offered challenges for the promising reaction of photocatalytic CO2 reduction into fuels.Indeed, Ag2CrO4/NG/PI hybrid demonstrated great catalytic activity for RhB photodegradation.The RhB solution under visible light irradiation for 17 min could entirely be blanched in the presence of the 25AN sample, with a degradation rate of 0.24 min -1 , which was 6.3 times higher than those of NG and 3.7 times higher than those of Ag2CrO4.

In order to scrutinize the most important effective compounds in the oxidative photoassisted catalytic of RhB over the Ag2CrO4/NG/PI nanocomposites, the reactive species harvesting tests have been designed.These experiments are beneficial in concluding the charge transmission path in the composite 72,73.The photoassisted-catalytic process of 25AN with diverse quenchers is exhibited in Fig. S5.Remarkably, no obvious effect for IPA or Isopropanol as an OH60-62 quencher on the degradation rate of RhB has been observed.However, the introduction of benzoquinone (BQ, O2 -scavenger) 73,74 decreased the RhB decomposition rate from 0.2 min -1 to 0.02 and EDTA (h scavenger) introduction 74,75 decreased it to 0.11 min -1 , suggesting that O2 -and h were the most important effective species in the photoassisted-catalytic processes of Ag2CrO4/NG/PI nanocomposites.Also, the reactive species harvesting tests were done using the same procedure for the samples of Ag2CrO4and NG.The results (Fig. 8d) indicated that h was the foremost effective compounds in the RhB decomposition of Ag2CrO4, which was in line with the prior published articles 75 The result is admissible by bearing in mind that the conduction band potential of Ag2CrO4is much lower than the standard reduction ability of O2 -/O2,.Similar to Ag2CrO4/NG/PI, the foremost reactive species for pure NG are O2 -and h.Undoubtedly, the conduction band of NG the electron can be improved by electrons that reduces O2 to O 2 -in Ag2CrO4/NG/PI only when the electron and holes transfer by the Zscheme mechanism.If not, accumulation of the photo-excited electron on the conduction band of Ag2CrO4 leads to the controlling effective species of h, which is incongruent with the obtained results.The provided data in Fig. 8d confirm that efficient Ag2CrO4/NG/PI nanocomposites follow the photoassisted catalytic Z-scheme system.Under these circumstances, the photoassisted catalytic EH in the hybrides are segregated properly and hence an excellent photocatalytic activity is achieved.In the current study, the great effectiveness of photoassisted catalytic Z-scheme system is demonstrated, and a promising method or the photocatalytic abatement of CO2 to fuels, also, the environmental protection of air pollution utilizing photo-assisted catalytic approach is provided."}, {"llm generation": "Vis-light", "source": "Succinctly, this investigation have successfully reported the fabrication and characterization of new nanaocomposite including of Ag2CrO4/NG, PI/NG, Ag2CrO4/PI and Ag2CrO4/NG/PI with diverse ratio of components (5-50 AN) that were applied as photocatalysts under Vis-light irradiation.", "context": "Succinctly, this investigation have successfully reported the fabrication and characterization of new nanaocomposite including of Ag2CrO4/NG, PI/NG, Ag2CrO4/PI and Ag2CrO4/NG/PI with diverse ratio of components (5-50 AN) that were applied as photocatalysts under Vis-light irradiation.The photo-assisted catalytic activity results of as synthesized compounds demonstrated that the optimal Ag2CrO4/NG/PI (25AN) is more active than others.The performance of Ag2CrO4/NG/PI as a ternary Z-scheme photo-assistedcatalyst was explained based on the E-H reconstruction of the conduction bond electrons of Ag2CrO4 and the valence bond holes of PI happened trough NG as a electron mediator with the purpose of the creation of further oxidative holes in the valence bond of Ag2CrO4 and more reactive O2 -in the conduction bond of PI.Ag2CrO4/NG/PI facilities a quick charge distance and transfer of photogenerated EHPs to generate a high efficient oxidative and reductive photocatalyst for reduction of CO2..Meanwhile, the quick transmission of photogenerated electrons from Ag2CrO4 to NG before Ag is changed to Ag 0 successfully showed the photo-corrosion of Ag2CrO4 and thus enhances the durability of the nanocomposite.The study will promote the investigations of Z-scheme photocatalysts system and improve the knowledge of the combined silver-nitrogen compounds with high performance catalytic activity under visible light condition and stability. spectroscopy were registered by employing an AC voltage of 10 mV amplitude in the frequency range of 100-10 -1 Hz in 0.01 M Na2SO4.It is noteworthy that for photocurrent (PC) tests, a 350 W Xenon lamp and Na2SO4 (0.1 M) were applied as a light source and as the electrolyte respectively. Fig.1 (a) and Fig.1 (b) present the XRD analysis of Ag2CrO4, NG, Ag2CrO4/PI, Ag2CrO4/NG, PI/NG and 25AN before and after degradation respectively.Herein, 25AN is selsected as a optimum catalyst for photo-assisted CO2 reduction.According to the (JCPDS Card No. 26-0952 45-47 of the bare Ag2CrO4, the Bragg diffraction peaks at 2 21.7 o , 31.1 o , 31.4 o , 32.3 o , 33.7 o , 39.3 o , 44.3 o , 45.4 o , 52.1 o , 55.8 o , 57.1 o and 61.9 o can be undoubtedly indexed to the (120), (031), (211), (002), (131), (122), (240), (222), (400), (242), (213) and (431) crystal planes of the Fig.3 a and b showed FE-SEM and TEM images of PI that demonstrated a vast exfoliate constructed by layer by layer structre.FE-SEM and TEM images of NG were shown in Fig.3c and d as rippling sheets.In addition, it was that showed C 1s, N 1s and O 1s indicative signals at 285.7eV, 397.4 eV and 531.8 eV, respectively.Fig.S3bdemonstrated two characteristic signals at 395.4 eV and 397.5 eV that can be assigned to pyridinic and graphitic nitrogen of NG respectively48,49.According to Fig.S3c, the C 1s peak of NG referred to C-C, CC, C-N, CO and O-CO bonds that appeared at 285.1, 286.0, 287.3, 288.2 and 290.5 eV, respectively50.The above observations can reveal that N2H4 reduced GO to graphene and nitrogen-doped graphene compound through decoration of nitrogen atoms on the graphene.XPS patterns of 25AN composite and Ag2CrO4 photocatalyst were presented in Fig.4.In Fig.4it can be found that 25AN contains of silver, chrome, oxygen, carbon and nitrogen atoms.In Fig.4ftwo characteristic signals can be observed at 367.0 eV and 372.5 eV matching to Ag 3d5/2 and Ag 3d3/2 respectively, that indicate the oxidation number of the silver ions is 1.Fig.4epresents a peak at 576.2 eV referred to the binding energy of Cr in Ag2CrO451.The peak of O 1s in Fig.4dis 531.6 eV and belonged to oxygen atoms in Ag2CrO452.Meanwhile, XRD pattern of C 1s of 25AN (Fig.4b), shows two signals at 284.5 and 288.1 eV, that can be referred to C-C/CC and O-CO bonds, respectively.The significant enhancement in the peak of O-CO at 288.2 eV confirms successful combination of PI in 25AN photocatalyst53.The comparison of Fig.4cwith Fig.S3b, shows negligible alteration in nirogen 1s signal.The above scrutiny can be referred to successful recombination of Ag2CrO4, NG and PI together. conduction band of Ag2CrO4 transfer to Ag 0 due to conduction band edges of Ag2CrO4 is more negative than the Fermi level of Ag 0 and second the holes in the valence band of NG transfer to Ag 0 and admix with the electrons.
