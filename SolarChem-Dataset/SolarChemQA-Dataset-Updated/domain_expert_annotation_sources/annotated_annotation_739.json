that a further increase in used amount of TEOA promote the CdS phase transformation from hexagonal wurtzite to cubic zinc-blende during hydrothermal process, and detailed investigations indicate that the heteronanoparticles possess explicit heterointerfaces and strong light absorption as well as tunable band gaps.Especially when used as photocatalyst toward reduction of CO2 to CO and CH4 in the

unprecedented cycling stability, without hardly deactivation over 100 h.The remarkable improvement of photoactivity and stability over CdS-based hybrid can be attributed to better electronhole pair separation and migration owing to junctions formed by coexistence of wurtzite and zinc-blende in the CdS nanohybrids, according to the physicochemical characterization.Additionally, the role of the junctions endowed by wurtzite/zinc-blende CdS in the process of the CO2 photoreduction is evaluated by using transient photocurrents and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) analysis, illustrating

solarfuel owing to the high-quality and facilely synthesized CdS phase junctions.", "context": "The mixed-phase CdS surface-phase junction was obtained by treating CdCl 22 .5H 2 O and thioacetamide solution at 180Cwith controlled TEOA dosages and reaction times, and the effects of the TEOA dosages and the hydrothermal reaction time on crystallization process were examined by XRD. 1a).The results indicate that the phase transformation has been undergoing from wurtzite to zinc-blende by ranging the TEOA dosage (denoted as HCS-n, n TEOA dosage 0.3, 1.0, 2.0 g).Furthermore, with the further increase of the TEOA amount up to 5.0 g, this concludes the high-percentage of the zinc-blende CdS in the overall crystals, while very small amount of second phase can be assigned to hexagonal phase of wurtzite CdS (denoted as CS-5).According to these XRD results, indicating that the nanoheterostructured wurtzite/zinc-blende CdS hybrids could be easily tuned under present hydrothermal conditions, while TEOA is essential for formation and transformation of junctions between wurtzite and zinc-blende CdS.This might be because weak basic system endowed by TEOA adjusts the dissociation rate of thioacetamide, that is to say, dissociation and diffusion rates based on the competitively reaction kinetics of between metal cations and sulphide anions assisted by OH -could boost the phase transformation from wurtzite to zinc-blende during the sulfidation process.To further identify the role of TEOA, appropriate amount of other inorganic base or organic base (e.g.ammonia, ethylene diamine, NaOH) instead of TEOA were used, and the mixed-phase CdS samples were also obtained (Fig. 2).These results clearly suggested that the formation of the mixed-phase CdS surface-phase junctions mainly depends on the present weak basic hydrothermal system, that is, the general control can be achieved by adding alkali liquors such as TEOA, En, etc to prepare heterostructured CdS hybrids.Additionally, hydrothermal treatment time is also a very influential factor in formation of CdS surface-phase junction. As to be shown in Fig. 1b and Fig. S1, cubic zinc-blende CdS obtained in less than an hour displays characteristic X-ray diffraction peaks that are representative of semi-amorphous semiconductor materials.Afterward, increasing the reaction time from 1 h to 12 h, we observe that the diffraction peaks of zinc-blende CdS on intensity decrease gradually, whereas the intensity of diffraction peaks for wurtzite CdS increases slowly.This result shows that wurtzite CdS can be in situ transformed from zinc-blende CdS with the increase of the hydrothermal treatment time.On the basis of above analysis (Fig. 1 and Fig. 2), demonstrating that the weak alkaline surroundings induced by TEOA or other alkali liquors easily leads to formation of mixed-phase CdS heterojunctions in the current hydrothermal system, and the hydrothermal treatment time can be effectively applied to control the phase transformation process from zinc-blende to wurtzite in the hydrothermal condition of 180 C. The crystalline microstructure of heterostructured CdS based sample (HCS-1) was provided by TEM and SEM.From Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins Fig. 3a and 3b, the low magnification TEM and SEM images reveal that HCS-1 is composed of a large number of uniform nanoparticles, with sizes ranging from 20 to 40 nm.To verify the heterostructure proposed by XRD results, high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) characterization was performed.As presented in Fig. 3c, it can be clearly seen that the highly crystalline heterointerface between wurtzite and zinc-blende crystalline phase can be readily obtained.Meanwhile, the interplanar d spacing of 0.316 nm is in good agreement with that of the (101) plane of hexagonal wurtzite CdS, and the d spacing of 0.336 nm is also assigned to that of the cubic zinc-blende CdS (111) planes in the mixed-phase CdS hybrid, indicating the formation of CdS-based surface-phase junctions in the nanohybrids.In addition, the chemical composition of the sample was characterized by energydispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX).As shown insert in the Fig. 3d, the sample is composed of Cd and S and the atomic ratio of Cd to S is ca.1.01, which is consistent with the stoichiometric value for CdS.The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern in Fig. 3d also confirms that the hybrid possesses an apparently polycrystalline characteristic.On the basis of the above structural information, it is obvious that high-quality phase junctions between wurtzite CdS and zinc-blende CdS are successfully achieved through current one-step hydrothermal method.The further detail of the samples on surface composition and chemical state were also investigated by XPS technique and the corresponding results are displayed in Fig. 3e and3f.In Fig. 3e, the Cd 3d XPS spectrum of HS-0 gives two characteristic peaks located at 405.07 and 411.80 eV, which could be assigned to Cd 3d 5/2 and Cd 3d 3/2 , respectively. 33In addition, it is observed from Fig. 3f that the two main peaks at 161.44 eV and 161.62 eV can be attributed to the S 2p 3/2 and S 2p 1/2 , respectively, indicating that the valence state of element S is -2. 34However, the Cd 3d and S 2p peak positions in the HCS-1 hybrid and CS-5 moved slightly toward the lower binding energy compared to HS-0 (Fig. 3e and3f) in turn.This is probably because the HS-0 contains pure wurtzite CdS phase and CS-5 almost own a zinc-blende CdS phase.On the contrary, the heterostructured HCS-1 sample has a mixture phase of zinc-blende CdS and wurtzite CdS.Thus, the different crystal structures of HCS-1 are responsible for the differences in their chemical environment, which is consistent with the XRD and TEM results reported above.In addition, this phenomenon was also observed in the XPS results of m-BiVO 4 /t-BiVO 4 heterostructures.23 Photocatalytic CO 2 conversion to solar fuel is an extremely attractive approach to store solar energy in the form of chemical fuel.Therefore, the heterostructured HCS-n samples were expected to use in the reaction of CO 2 reduction with H 2 O under visible-light irradiation.The controlled blank reactions were firstly performed without light irradiation or in the absence of the photocatalyst, and no products were detected.The effect of various H 2 O amount on photocatalytic activity was also investigated and shown in Fig. 4.Only small amount of CH 4 and CO over HCS-1 was obtained in the absence of H 2 O. Whereas, once water was added, aside from CH 4 and CO obtained by CO 2 reduction, H 2 was also detected.Especially, the H 2 -evoluting rate increases with increase in H 2 O content, and gas-generation (CO and CH 4 ) rate conversely decreases in the CO 2 reduction process.This is mainly because H 2 O can not only serve as an electron donor and hydrogen source for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, but also it can also act as a competing reagent in a CO 2 photoreduction system and compete favorably for the electrons and produce the preferential generation of H 2 . 35,36 To further gain insight into the effect of CdS heterostructurebased phase junction for CO 2 photoreduction reaction, photocatalytic performances of series of mixed-phase CdS samples was tested.Fig. 5a and5b show the evolution of main products (CH 4 and CO) as a function of reaction time over various CdS-based photocatalysts prepared with various TEOA usages.From the curves, the yield of both CH 4 and CO over each catalyst increase proportionally with the reaction time.However, it should be noted that all the heterostructured HCS-n samples exhibits markedly enhanced photocatalytic activity than pure HS-0, CS-5, and HS-0CS-5 by physical mixing.Among these heterostructured CdS samples, the HCS-1 displays the highest CH 4 -and CO-evolving activity.According to the results of column of CO and CH 4 evolution rates versus various CdS samples induced by TEOA (Fig. 5c), and the maximal rate of CO evolution over HCS-1 up to 1.61 mol h correspondingly the maximal rate of CH 4 evolution is ca.0.31 mol h -1 g -1 .The calculated yields of main products for the HCS-1 is nearly 27 times higher than that of the pure HS-0 sample.Meanwhile, the yields of both CO and CH 4 over HCS-1 is also almost 16 times greater than that of the CS-5 consisting of the mounting percentage of the zinc-blende CdS.The photocatalytic activity decreased in the order of HCS-1 HCS-0.5 HCS-2 HCS-3 HCS-0.1 HS-0CS-5 CS-5 HS-0 (Fig. 5c and Fig. S2).Obviously, the higher CH 4 -and COevolving rate of the HCS-1 sample may derive from coexistence of optimized phase junctions between zinc-blende CdS with wurtzite CdS.However, it is noteworthy that further increasing zinc-blende through more TEOA dosage leads to a slow reduction of photocatalytic CH 4 -and CO-producing activity.Therefore, this result allows us to realize the surface-phase junction affection that can play dominant roles in promoting photogenerated charges separation and migration. 1819920 Additionally, when the heterostructured CdS samples prepared by other alkali liquors (e.g.NH 3 H 2 O, EDA, NaOH) instead of HCS-1 was used, these mix-phase CdS samples also show similar photocatalytic activities for converting CO 2 into CH 4 and CO (Fig. 5d) in the presence of water vapor.Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins during CO 2 photoreduction process, without hardly obvious changes in activity after 100 h stability test under the same reaction conditions.In this study, to verify the cause of long photocatalytic lifetime, the stability of mixed-phase CdS surface-phase junction with suitable bonding region was investigated by HRTEM and XRD. On the basis of the HRTEM (Fig. 6b) and XRD (Fig. 6c) after 100 h reaction times, it can be found that the stable chemical composition and phase junction of the HCS-1 nanohybrid was still maintained. The results demonstrated that the phase junction is very stable during photocatalytic reaction process, and chemical composition of CdS remains unchanged by prolonging irradiation time.The unprecedented phtotostability may be related to the suitable bonding region width, which can be the shield for phase junction. 32n view of these experimental results, the heterostructured CdSbased nanohybrid exhibits undoubtedly the unique advantages of facile fabrication, tunable heterointerfaces, high CH 4 -/CO-producing activity and durably long lifetime, which make it a competitive candidate as a sulfide photocatalyst for converting CO 2 into solarfuel owing to the high-quality and facilely synthesized CdS phase junctions. In order to explore the nature of differences in photocatalytic activities of different CdS photocatalysts, the physicochemical characterization of the series of CdS samples were conducted.As displayed in Fig. S3, it is evidence that the particle size cannot responsible for the difference of photocatalytic activity of CdSbased nanohybrids because of their similar values.Subsequently, the optical properties of samples were examined by UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS).The optical absorption properties of the as-prepared HCS-1 sample are shown in Fig. 7a, along with these of the HS-0 and CS-5 obtained for comparison.According to the DRS results, the HS-0 sample had a band gap of 2.20 eV, corresponding to an optical absorption edge of ca.560 nm.However, the band gap value of CS-5 sample was deduced to be 2.30 eV, corresponding to an optical absorption edge of about 539 nm.Apparently, as comparison with HS-0 and CS-5 samples, heterostructured HCS-1 sample on the absorption edge is calculated to be ca.550 nm that is lower than that of the value of absorption edge of HS-0 and larger than the absorption edge value of CS-5.This result confirms the coexistence of two crystalline phases of CdS.As for HCS-1, it should be pointed out that the optical absorption intensity of HCS-1 sample is higher than that of the isolated CdS sample.The difference in photo-absorption may be also originated from the unique junctions between zinc-blende CdS and wurtzite CdS in this composition.Additionally, to understand the electronic band structure of heterostructured HCS-n sample, valence band XPS (VB XPS) was used for the observation of the valence band electronic state of these as-prepared samples (Fig. 7b).It is estimated that the valence band (E VB ) potentials of HS-0, HCS-1, and CS-5 are ca.1.51V, 1.30 V, and 1.32 V in turn.Wherefore, the conduction band potential (E CB ) of HS-0, HCS-1, and CS-5 is estimated at about -0.69 V, -0.95, and -1.00, respectively, obtained by the Eg E VB -E CB .The difference in the conductionband potentials for the two phases can be also revealed by measuring the flat-band potentials of CdS samples.The Mott-Schottky plots for HS-0, HCS-1, and CS-5 film in 0.5 mol/L Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins Na 2 SO 4 solution (pH7) were given in Fig. 7c.On the basis of the Mott-Schottky analysis, the flat-band potentials (E fb ) of HS-0, HCS-1, and CS-5 are -0.59V, -0.62 V, and -0.72 V vs. SCE (-0.35 V, -0.38 V, and -0.48 V vs. NHE), respectively.As far as the n-type semiconductors are concerned, generally speaking, their conduction band potentials (E CB ) in values are more negative than those of corresponding E fb and is considered to be located on top of the E fb (0.1-0.2 V more negative). 37,38In view of this, it is estimated that conduction band potentials (E CB ) of HS-0, HCS-1, and CS-5 are ca.-0.65 V, -0.72 V, and -0.82 V, respectively, which was less than the redox potential of CO/CO 2 (-0.53 V vs NHE, at pH 7.00). 23 These values are close to the conduction band potentials derived from the valence band.These results show that the conduction band potential of HS-0 is more positive than that of CS-5, and the valence band potential of CS-5 is less negative than that of HS-0.Thus, a band structure based on the type II heterojunction 7 can be formed in CdS nanohybrids consisting of wurtzite and zinc-blende CdS (Fig. 7d).Once CdS is activated by the photon energy to form electrons and holes, the type II heterojunction can drive the electros and holes near surface to flow in opposite direction between HS-0 and CS-5 through the junction channel by the potential difference, while the highquality phase junction from HCS-1 could serve as an active site to drive more photo-generated holes to drift into valence band of wurtzite CdS and promote the separation of charge carries more effectively, which therefore enhance their photocatalytic CO and CH 4 evolution performances and decrease the photocorrosion rate of CdS photocatalysts for reaction kinetics..The photo-electrochemical characterization was performed to further confirm that the mixed-phase CdS heterostructure has a better ability to transfer generated charge carrier (Fig. 8a).As compared to HS-0 and CS-5, heterostructured HCS-1 gives the superior transient photocurrents under visible light illumination.Of special note that the transient photocurrent intensities of these CdS-based samples are consistent with the photocatalytic CH 4 -/COevolving rates reported above (Fig. 5).It is obvious that the optimum heterointerface mediated by zinc-blende CdS and wurtzite CdS in the hybrid can promote photo-generated electron/hole migrating, suggesting the efficient photo-induced charge separation and transfer occurring on the heterostructured HCS-1 sample. Additionally, the Nyquist plots of the impedance data of samples were studied in order to further reveal the charge transfer process.As presented in Fig. 8b, the charge-transfer resistance of HCS-1 sample significantly decreased in the middle-frequency region as compared with those of HS-0 and CS-5 samples, according to the semicircles provided these CdS film electrodes, demonstrating a diminution in the electron recombination time.This EIS analysis indicates that the more efficient transfer of photo-generated carriers as a cooperative result of the junctions between zincblende and wurtzite CdS is demonstrated.Therefore, the CdS-based phase junctions can effectively reduce the rapid recombination rate of electron-hole pairs within photocatalytic materials and prolong The photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra were further employed to offer helpful information on the transfer and recombination of photo-generated charge carriers.Generally, the fluorescence emission results from the charge recombination, the less charge-recombination rate means the lower fluorescence.As shown in Fig. 8c, the broad fluorescence peaks for HCS-1, CS-5, and HS-0 located at 550 nm are related to the near band-edge emission of CdS, 39 and the band-gap emission peak on CS-5 sample exhibit a certain extent of blue shift in comparison with that of HCS-1, indicating that CS-5 sample has a greater band gap than HCS-1.This is also demonstrated through DRS results reported above (Fig. 7a).Additionally, the sharp fluorescence peaks for HCS-1, CS-5, and HS-0 centered at 623 nm are related to the trap-state recombination. 37On the basis of preceding XRD results (Fig. 1), we observe that as the TEOA dosage was increased from 1 g to 5.0 g, the wurtzite CdS phase in heterostructured HCS-1 is decreases gradually, but zinc-blende phase increases gradually.Obviously, a strong emission demonstrated by the high PL peak on CS-5 can be realized to boost recombination of photoexcited charges because of superfluous lattice defects provided by S. 40 As compared to the CS-5 sample, the much lower PL peak of heterostructured HCS-1 indicates that photoexcited charges on HCS-1 can be effectively utilized and the charge carriers are favorable to migrate to the initiate CdS heterointerface formed by the wurtzite and zinc-blende CdS.This result also indicates that the high-quality phase junctions endowed by wurtzite and zinc-blende CdS can effectively retard electron-hole recombination and promote the interfacial chargecarriers transport, 8,32 leading to more electrons to involve in reducing CO 2 into CO and CH 4 .In addition, further evidence comes from the time-resolved transient-state photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra tests (Fig. 8d).The TRPL tests reveal that the decay lifetime of charge carriers in HCS-1 is shorter than those of CS-5 and HS-0, implying that the lifetime of photo-generated holes in HCS-1 might be very short and can be effectively utilized in the reactions rather than the recombination with the transferred electrons, thus inducing the best performance in the reactions of CO 2 reduction with H 2 O."}, {"llm generation": "CdS", "source": "In summary, heterointerface-tuned CdS photocatalyst composed of wurtzite CdS and zinc-blende CdS have been designed and fabricated by tuning the reaction parameters.", "context": "In summary, heterointerface-tuned CdS photocatalyst composed of wurtzite CdS and zinc-blende CdS have been designed and fabricated by tuning the reaction parameters.The formation of the unique phase junctions is mainly determined by at present hydrothermal surroundings induced by TEOA on the basis of the TEOA-dependent in situ crystalline phase wurtzite/zinc-blende transition.In comparison with the isolate wurtzite CdS, the heterostructured CdS nanohybrids Fig. 1a shows the XRD patterns of the products prepared at different amounts of TEOA.It can be observed that diffraction peaks of Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins sample prepared in the absence of TEOA are well-indexed to the pure hexagonal wurtzite CdS (JCPDS card No. 41-1049) (indicated as HS-0).However, of all the samples synthesized under different amount of TEOA, diffraction peaks at 26.5 o and 30.6 o corresponding to the cubic zinc-blende CdS (JCPDS card No. 10-0454) in comparison to the HS-0 are detected, suggesting that introduction of TEOA is favourable for CdS in situ phase transformation from hexagonal wurtzite to cubic zinc-blende.As to be observed later, increasing the used amount of the TEOA from 0.1 g to 2.0 g, the intensities of the diffraction peaks for hexagonal wurtzite located at 28.2 o , 36.6 o and 47.8 o decrease gradually, whereas the diffraction peaks for cubic zinc-blende centered at 26.5 and 30.6 increases continually (shown with arrow in Fig. Fig. 1 The XRD patterns of the samples prepared at 180Cunder different (a) TEOA amount and (b) hydrothermal treatment time, respectively.
