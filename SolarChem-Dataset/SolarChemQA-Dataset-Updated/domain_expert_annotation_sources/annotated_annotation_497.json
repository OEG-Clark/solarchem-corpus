Figure 1 shows the XRD patterns of the as-synthesized CeO 2 -TiO 2 with different cerium loading.It can be seen that the peaks at 2 values of 25.17, 37.60, 47.76, 54.01 and 62.60 which are indexed to the (101), (004), ( 200), ( 105) and (204) planes of the anatase phase of TiO 2 (JCPDS: 21-1272) appeared for all samples.It is noteworthy that no cerium oxide peaks could be observed in the XRD spectra for samples with 1 wt ceria loading.This might be due to all the ceria ions were incorporated into the structures of titania or the size of the particles which are too small that cannot be detected by XRD.On the other hand, the small peak of cerium oxide was seen to appear in the spectra for 2 wt loading and the peaks was clearly seen for 5 wt loading.The crystallite sizes of anatase of samples were calculated using Scherrer's equation according to (101) peak.The values are 9.9 nm, 9.8 nm and 9.2 nm for CeO 2 -TiO 2 samples of 1 wt, 2 wt and 5 wt ceria loading on TiO 2 , respectively.The crystalline size of the anatase phase formed decreased with the content of Ce oxide doped, which indicates that the Ce species inhibit the growth of anatase TiO 2 crystallite and it agrees well with the literature report 9. Figure 2 shows the pore size distribution curves of all photocatalysts.The pore diameter was ranged from 8 -15 nm indicating that the pores are mainly mesoporous in nature.The textural properties of the catalysts are summarized in Table 1, which shows that the surface area and pore volume changes was insignificantly with ceria loading of 1 wt and 2 wt but drastically decreases with 5 wt.It was previously reported that the specific surface area and the pore volume of catalyst prepared by the impregnation method decrease with increasing metal loading 10.3(a) to explore the influence of the ceria addition amount on the optical property of TiO 2 .From the Figure 3(a), a slight shift to the visible light region occurred as the amount of ceria was increased corresponds to a band gap of 2.4, 2.2 eV, and 2.15 eV for 1 wt, 2 wt and 5 wt ceria loading on TiO 2 , respectively as shown in Figure 3(b).This indicates that the CeO 2 -TiO 2 absorbs well in the visible light region due to presence of ceria.This is due to the charge transfer from impurity level to the conduction band.The impurity is caused by some of Ce 3 /Ce 4 sites have been replaced by Ti 4 ions 11.The absorption increases with the increasing of ceria content since the color of CeO 2 -TiO 2 changes from pale yellow to yellow from the observation in the catalyst preparation. The photoluminescence spectra are useful to understand the surface process in which photogenerated electron-holes take part in photocatalysis.The existence of photoluminescence can be attributed to the recombination of excited electron-hole pairs.In Figure 4, there are two obvious PL peaks at 420 nm which attributed to the band-edge free exciton luminescence while the peak at 470 nm indicates the bound exciton luminescence 12.The peaks positions for all samples are basically the same.However, the intensity of PL spectra is different.It shows that the intensity is decrease, indicating the lower rate of recombination of electron-hole pairs with increasing ceria loading.This is due to the possibility of Ce 3 ions existence in CeO 2 -TiO 2 that could interact with holes and inhibit the recombination of photogenerated electron-holes 6. Methanol was determined in liquid phase while there were no products in gas phase.Other products such as formic acid and formaldehyde could also be formed 13, but they were undetectable.The methanol is possibly produced by the reduction of CO 2 and carbonate (CO 2 dissolve in water and form carbonate in water) as in Equation ( 1)-(3). Figure 5 shows the yield of methanol formation by CO 2 photocatalytic reduction as functions of the irradiation time for CeO 2 -TiO 2 with 1 wt, 2 wt and 5 wt ceria loading.It can be seen that the yield of methanol increased with the irradiation time for all photocatalysts.The methanol yield increased with increasing ceria loading from 1 wt to 2 wt.This may be due to the extend response range into visible light region with increase the ceria loading, thus more photo energy could be absorbed by catalyst thus generate more electron-hole pairs.Moreover, the decreasing of electron hole recombination rate with increasing ceria loading also contributes in enhancing the methanol yield.However, the methanol yield decreased after loading with 5 wt ceria although the band gap and electron hole recombination rate decrease indicating that there is an optimum amount cerium loading for CeO 2 -TiO 2.Moreover, the decreasing of specific surface area of 5 wt CeO 2 -TiO 2 catalyst also the factor that causes the decreasing in methanol yield since less reactant could be adsorbed onto the catalyst surface.The mechanism explanation of the decreasing of methanol yield could be described as follows: TiO 2 can adsorb carbonate species efficiently 14.Then, CeO 2 which dispersed on the TiO 2 surface can absorb visible light and transfer the excited electrons to TiO 2 so that the carbonate species on the TiO 2 surface can be reduced to methanol.The coverage of TiO 2 surface by CeO 2 is optimum at 2 wt, thus enough uncovered surface of TiO 2 for carbonate species adsorption.However, more CeO 2 has covered the surface of TiO 2 when the ceria loading increases to 5 wt, resulted less surface of TiO 2 is in contact with carbonate species.Therefore, the photocatalytic activity decreases due to lowering of the available surface area even though the absorption of light by CeO 2 increases.

Figure 1 shows the XRD patterns of the as-synthesized CeO 2 -TiO 2 with different cerium loading.It can be seen that the peaks at 2 values of 25.17, 37.60, 47.76, 54.01 and 62.60 which are indexed to the (101), (004), ( 200), ( 105) and (204) planes of the anatase phase of TiO 2 (JCPDS: 21-1272) appeared for all samples.It is noteworthy that no cerium oxide peaks could be observed in the XRD spectra for samples with 1 wt ceria loading.This might be due to all the ceria ions were incorporated into the structures of titania or the size of the particles which are too small that cannot be detected by XRD.On the other hand, the small peak of cerium oxide was seen to appear in the spectra for 2 wt loading and the peaks was clearly seen for 5 wt loading.The crystallite sizes of anatase of samples were calculated using Scherrer's equation according to (101) peak.The values are 9.9 nm, 9.8 nm and 9.2 nm for CeO 2 -TiO 2 samples of 1 wt, 2 wt and 5 wt ceria loading on TiO 2 , respectively.The crystalline size of the anatase phase formed decreased with the content of Ce oxide doped, which indicates that the Ce species inhibit the growth of anatase TiO 2 crystallite and it agrees well with the literature report 9. Figure 2 shows the pore size distribution curves of all photocatalysts.The pore diameter was ranged from 8 -15 nm indicating that the pores are mainly mesoporous in nature.The textural properties of the catalysts are summarized in Table 1, which shows that the surface area and pore volume changes was insignificantly with ceria loading of 1 wt and 2 wt but drastically decreases with 5 wt.It was previously reported that the specific surface area and the pore volume of catalyst prepared by the impregnation method decrease with increasing metal loading 10.3(a) to explore the influence of the ceria addition amount on the optical property of TiO 2 .From the Figure 3(a), a slight shift to the visible light region occurred as the amount of ceria was increased corresponds to a band gap of 2.4, 2.2 eV, and 2.15 eV for 1 wt, 2 wt and 5 wt ceria loading on TiO 2 , respectively as shown in Figure 3(b).This indicates that the CeO 2 -TiO 2 absorbs well in the visible light region due to presence of ceria.This is due to the charge transfer from impurity level to the conduction band.The impurity is caused by some of Ce 3 /Ce 4 sites have been replaced by Ti 4 ions 11.The absorption increases with the increasing of ceria content since the color of CeO 2 -TiO 2 changes from pale yellow to yellow from the observation in the catalyst preparation. The photoluminescence spectra are useful to understand the surface process in which photogenerated electron-holes take part in photocatalysis.The existence of photoluminescence can be attributed to the recombination of excited electron-hole pairs.In Figure 4, there are two obvious PL peaks at 420 nm which attributed to the band-edge free exciton luminescence while the peak at 470 nm indicates the bound exciton luminescence 12.The peaks positions for all samples are basically the same.However, the intensity of PL spectra is different.It shows that the intensity is decrease, indicating the lower rate of recombination of electron-hole pairs with increasing ceria loading.This is due to the possibility of Ce 3 ions existence in CeO 2 -TiO 2 that could interact with holes and inhibit the recombination of photogenerated electron-holes 6. Methanol was determined in liquid phase while there were no products in gas phase.Other products such as formic acid and formaldehyde could also be formed 13, but they were undetectable.The methanol is possibly produced by the reduction of CO 2 and carbonate (CO 2 dissolve in water and form carbonate in water) as in Equation ( 1)-(3). Figure 5 shows the yield of methanol formation by CO 2 photocatalytic reduction as functions of the irradiation time for CeO 2 -TiO 2 with 1 wt, 2 wt and 5 wt ceria loading.It can be seen that the yield of methanol increased with the irradiation time for all photocatalysts.The methanol yield increased with increasing ceria loading from 1 wt to 2 wt.This may be due to the extend response range into visible light region with increase the ceria loading, thus more photo energy could be absorbed by catalyst thus generate more electron-hole pairs.Moreover, the decreasing of electron hole recombination rate with increasing ceria loading also contributes in enhancing the methanol yield.However, the methanol yield decreased after loading with 5 wt ceria although the band gap and electron hole recombination rate decrease indicating that there is an optimum amount cerium loading for CeO 2 -TiO 2.Moreover, the decreasing of specific surface area of 5 wt CeO 2 -TiO 2 catalyst also the factor that causes the decreasing in methanol yield since less reactant could be adsorbed onto the catalyst surface.The mechanism explanation of the decreasing of methanol yield could be described as follows: TiO 2 can adsorb carbonate species efficiently 14.Then, CeO 2 which dispersed on the TiO 2 surface can absorb visible light and transfer the excited electrons to TiO 2 so that the carbonate species on the TiO 2 surface can be reduced to methanol.The coverage of TiO 2 surface by CeO 2 is optimum at 2 wt, thus enough uncovered surface of TiO 2 for carbonate species adsorption.However, more CeO 2 has covered the surface of TiO 2 when the ceria loading increases to 5 wt, resulted less surface of TiO 2 is in contact with carbonate species.Therefore, the photocatalytic activity decreases due to lowering of the available surface area even though the absorption of light by CeO 2 increases.
