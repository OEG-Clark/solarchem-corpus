Yang and co-workers 9 found synergistic functions of 2propanol and HF on the growth of anatase TiO 2 single-crystal nanosheets.Similar to previously described work, in this paper tetrabutyl titanate was used as a titanium source instead of titanium tetrafluoride, HF and isopropyl alcohol were used as synergistic capping agent and reaction medium for preparing TiO 2 nanosheets, respectively.In a typical preparation process, 8 mL tetrabutyl titanate was added dropwise into a mixture of 1 mL hydrofluoric acid and 5 mL isopropyl alcohol with magnetic stirring for 20 min at room temperature.Then, the obtained precursor solution was transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, followed by a hydrothermal treatment at 180 C for 24 h.After cooling down to room temperature, the collected precipitates were washed with deionized water and ethanol for three times, and dried in a vacuum oven at 80 C for 10 h.At last, the particles were calcined at 600 C for 2 h and pure TiO 2 nanosheets were formed. CdS-TiO 2 composite was synthesized by hydrothermal method.Typically, 0.4 g of above TiO 2 nanosheets were added into 30 mL of deionized water and ultrasonically dispersed.Subsequently, 10 mL aqueous solution of CdCl 2 2.5H 2 O and (NH 2 ) 2 CS with determined concentration were dropped into the as prepared suspension of TiO 2 nanosheets under vigorous stirring, the molar ratio of cadmium to sulfur was kept at 1:1.The final mixture was stirred for 20 min and then hydrothermally treated at 140 C for 18 h.After centrifugal separation, the obtained precipitates were washed with ethanol and deionized water for three times, and then dried in a vacuum oven at 80 C for 8 h.

The crystallinity and phase of the different photocatalysts were determined by XRD.The XRD patterns of TiO 2 and CdS-TiO 2 composites in Fig. 2 showed that the characteristic peaks at 2A of 25.3, 37.9, 48.04, 53.9, and 54.98 to be assigned to (1 0 1), (0 0 4), (2 0 0), (1 0 5), and ( 2 CdS crystal (JCPDS41-1049).The intensities of the peaks for the cubic CdS were increased with the increase of CdS content.The XRD patterns in Fig. 2 illustrated that the CdS presented in a separated phase rather than in the TiO 2 lattice 19. The surface compositions and elemental valences of the CdS-TiO 2 -8 composite photocatalyst were determined by XPS.The fully scanned spectra in Fig. 3 showed that elements of Ti, Cd, O, S and trace of contaminated C element existed in CdS-TiO 2 heterojunction.Fig. 4 demonstrated the high-resolution XPS spectra with scanning over the area corresponding to the binding energies for Ti 2p, Cd 3d, S 2p, and O 1s.Two peaks located at 459.08 and 464.68 eV in Fig. 4(a) correspond to Ti 2p 3/2 and Ti 2p 1/2 , respectively, indicating a normal state of Ti 4 in the CdS-TiO 2 heterojunction.Meanwhile, it also can be noticed from Fig. 4(b) that there is a narrow peak with a binding energy of 530.4 eV, which was attributed to the crystal lattice oxygen of Ti-O 23.Fig. 4(c) was the high resolution XPS spectra for the Cd 3d, because of the spin-orbital splits, the Cd 3d 5/2 and Cd 3d 3/2 peaks also had characteristic double peaks centered at binding energies of 406.08 and 412.08 eV, respectively.These binding energies are consistent with reported values and confirm that the cadmium existed in one valence state (Cd 2 ) in the heterojunction 24.In Fig. 4(d), the S 2p binding energy value was 162.08 eV, which was the characteristic binding energy of CdS. The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of the samples were shown in Fig. 5.The pure TiO 2 was characterized by sharp absorption edge at about 390 nm.All of CdS-TiO 2 composites synthesized with different molar ratios showed strong absorbance in the visible-light region.The band gaps (E g ) of all the samples were also estimated according to the plot of the ( h ) 1/2 vs. photo energy (h ) 25 as shown in Fig. 6.From the extrapolated intercepts, the energy band gaps (E g ) of all the CdS-TiO 2 samples were very close to the energy band gaps of the pure TiO 2 (3.18 eV) and CdS (2.4 eV), which meant the absorption edges were not shifted for all the CdS-TiO 2 composites, Fig. 6 also indicated the spectral response of CdS-TiO 2 in visible area to be due to both TiO 2 and CdS were excited under the UV-vis spectra region.Moreover, with the increase of CdS content from 10:1 to 8:1 in samples, the absorption intensity increased correspondingly.The CdS-TiO 2 -8 showed the most obviously absorption of visible-light.However, further increase of the TiO 2 /CdS molar ratio was harmful for light absorbance because too much CdS would aggregate on the surface of TiO 2 nanosheets and thus prevent TiO 2 from absorbing light illuminate. The photocatalytic activities of the samples were evaluated by photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 in cyclohexanol under UV-vis (main wave length at 360 nm) light irradiation.In the experiments, there were three products to be identified by GC/MS analysis, CF, CH and trace of cyclohexyl ether.In order to evaluate the activity of the catalysts, CF and CH were chosen as the target products.Fig. 7 showed the reaction rates of various photocatalysts in 10 h.As can be see, photocatalytic performance of TiO 2 nanosheets was slightly better than that of the Degussa-P25, which could be attributed to the larger external surface area of the nanosheets than that of nearly spheric P25 particles with the same weight.The composites of CdS-TiO 2 exhibited much higher activities than those of the TiO 2 nanosheets and the CdS nanoparticles owing to the strong interaction between CdS and TiO 2 and finally resulted in the capability of the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 to be enhanced greatly.Furthermore, with the increase of CdS content in the composite from 10:1 to 8:1, the photocatalytic activities increased significantly, CdS-TiO 2 -8 appeared an optimum photocatalytic activity at formation rates of 20.2 mol-CF/(g cat h) and 20 mol-CH/(g cat h), respectively.The production rate of CF exhibited a slightly higher than that of CH because cyclohexanol was also oxidized to cyclohexyl ether.However, further increased CdScontent would decrease the activity when the TiO 2 /CdS molar ratios exceed 8, which could be attributed to too much CdS coated on the TiO 2 nanosheets.The photogenerated electrons reduced on TiO 2 , consequently leading to a relatively lower activity.In our high pressure mercury lamp, the wavelength distribution was from UV to visible light.The corresponding energy density was not uniform.For completing the pathways in Scheme 2, one mole of TiO 2 excited must match one mole of excited CdS.Otherwise, the exceed electron or hole will be recombined to reduce the reaction rates. Generally, the presence and content of CdS on TiO 2 undoubtedly played an important role in photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 . The separation and transportation of photo-induced carriers (i.e., electrons and holes) is crucial for the photocatalytic activity.Based on our experimental results, a mechanism for photoreduction of CO 2 on the heterostructured CdS-TiO 2 under UV-vis light irradiation was proposed in Scheme 2. The distribution of the products in photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 was closely related to how the band energies of the photocatalyst match the redox potentials of the reaction pathways.The anodic oxidation of the cyclohexanol was at 0.85 V 26, being less than the valence band potential (E VB ) of TiO 2 (2.7 V vs. NHE), which can facilitate subsequent Scheme 2. Schematic view for electron-hole separations and energy band matching of CdS-TiO2 heterostructure under UV-vis light irradiation.photocatalytic oxidative reaction of cyclohexanol.The conduction band potential (E CB ) of CdS was -1.0 V (vs.NHE), which was more negative than that of E 0 (CO 2 /HCOOH) 27.CF was produced by the esterification reaction between formic acid and cyclohexanol 28.Photocatalytic performance by CdS-TiO 2 composite demonstrated in this work proved that junction effect between two crystallites was also crucial for CO 2 photoeduction."}, {"llm generation": "UV-vis", "source": "The obtained CdS-TiO 2 nanocomposite was proved to have remarkable performance for photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 in cyclohexanol under UV-vis light irradiation, with CF and CH as the major products.", "context": "Heterojunction of CdS nanoparticles deposited on the surface of TiO 2 nanosheets were prepared by hydrothermal synthesis.TEM image revealed that CdS irregular particles were deposited on the surface of TiO 2 .The obtained CdS-TiO 2 nanocomposite was proved to have remarkable performance for photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 in cyclohexanol under UV-vis light irradiation, with CF and CH as the major products.Around 20.2 mol-CF/(g cat h) and 20 mol-CH/(g cat h) were produced when using TiO 2 /CdS with an optimum molar ratio of 8, which had been better enhanced photocatalytic activity than the pure TiO 2 and CdS.The mechanism for photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 in cyclohexanol to CH and CF was proposed and explained by band theory.

After a batch, the suspension in the reactor was centrifuged to separate solid catalyst from liquid, and the supernatant solution was analyzed by an Agilent 7890A GC with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a 60 m column of HP Wax.HP1800C GC-MS was used to qualify the products and then CF and CH were found.Blank experiments were also carried out to ensure the reaction to be solely from the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .One was light illuminated without the photocatalyst, and second was in the dark with the photocatalyst and CO 2 under the same experimental condition, third was light illuminated with the photocatalyst and bubbling N 2 rather than CO 2 .No products were detected in the above three tests."}], "operation mode": [{"llm generation": "Batch", "source": "The photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide was performed in a batch slurry bed reactor with inner capacity of 50 mL in which 0.02 g of photocatalyst was dispersed in 10 mL cyclohexanol.", "context": "Tetrabutyl titanate (TBOT, Ti (OC 4 H 9 ) 4 ), hydrofluoric acid (HF, 40 wt), isopropyl alcohol (PrOH), cadmium chloride (CdCl 2 2.5H 2 O) and sulfourea ((NH 2 ) 2 CS) used in synthesis of catalyst were purchased from Tianjin Guangfu Chemical Reagent Company.All reagents were analytical grade and used without any further purification.GC grade cyclohexanol (C 6 H 12 O) used for photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 was bought from Tianjin Xiensi Biochemical Technology Company. Yang and co-workers 9 found synergistic functions of 2propanol and HF on the growth of anatase TiO 2 single-crystal nanosheets.Similar to previously described work, in this paper tetrabutyl titanate was used as a titanium source instead of titanium tetrafluoride, HF and isopropyl alcohol were used as synergistic capping agent and reaction medium for preparing TiO 2 nanosheets, respectively.In a typical preparation process, 8 mL tetrabutyl titanate was added dropwise into a mixture of 1 mL hydrofluoric acid and 5 mL isopropyl alcohol with magnetic stirring for 20 min at room temperature.Then, the obtained precursor solution was transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, followed by a hydrothermal treatment at 180 C for 24 h.After cooling down to room temperature, the collected precipitates were washed with deionized water and ethanol for three times, and dried in a vacuum oven at 80 C for 10 h.At last, the particles were calcined at 600 C for 2 h and pure TiO 2 nanosheets were formed. CdS-TiO 2 composite was synthesized by hydrothermal method.Typically, 0.4 g of above TiO 2 nanosheets were added into 30 mL of deionized water and ultrasonically dispersed.Subsequently, 10 mL aqueous solution of CdCl 2 2.5H 2 O and (NH 2 ) 2 CS with determined concentration were dropped into the as prepared suspension of TiO 2 nanosheets under vigorous stirring, the molar ratio of cadmium to sulfur was kept at 1:1.The final mixture was stirred for 20 min and then hydrothermally treated at 140 C for 18 h.After centrifugal separation, the obtained precipitates were washed with ethanol and deionized water for three times, and then dried in a vacuum oven at 80 C for 8 h. For comparison, a series of CdS-TiO 2 photocatalysts with different molar ratios were synthesized through the same procedure by adjusting amounts of CdCl 2 2.5H 2 O and (NH 2 ) 2 CS, which were denoted as CdS-TiO 2 -X, where X represented different molar ratios of TiO 2 /CdS.Similarly, pristine CdS was also synthesized following the same procedure as mentioned above.
