Table 1 summaries the crystalline size and band gap of prepared Cu/TiO 2 films.The average crystalline sizes of all films ranged from 13.4 to 14.0 nm, which were calculated from the Scherrer's equation according to the peak broadening of XRD spectra.The crystalline sizes of Cu/TiO 2 were slightly smaller than that of TiO 2 . In general, the crystalline size was primarily influenced by calcined temperature, and Cu loading had negligible effect.The band gaps were ranged from 3.31 to 3.37 eV estimated by extrapolating the absorption edge of UV-Vis spectrum to x-axis, that is, approximately 367 nm.Those are typical TiO 2 band gap indicating the Cu loadings did not affect the band structure of TiO 2 .Table 2 lists the molar ratios of element composition of Cu/TiO 2 .The bulk composition was calculated from the amount of precursors in preparation procedure.The surface composition was estimated from the peak intensity of XPS, which usually only detected 1 nm depth of a sample.The Cu/Ti ratios of surface were higher than those of bulk indicating that most Cu was dispersed on the surface of catalysts.The higher the Cu loading, the higher the surface Cu ratio was.In addition, the ratio of hydroxyl group (OH)/oxygen on catalyst surface increased with in increasing Cu loading. Figure 7 shows the methanol yields versus light intensity under the partial pressures CO 2 and H 2 O at 1.29 and 0.026 bar, respectively.The yield increased with light intensity in the range of 1 to 16 W/cm 2 .Pure TiO 2 gave very little methanol yield while Cu/TiO 2 significantly increased the yield.The maximum yield of methanol was 0.45 mole/g-cathr using 1.2 wt Cu/TiO 2 catalyst under light intensity of 16 W/cm 2 .Cu 2 O served as active center for methanol synthesis in photocatalysis 15,16.Increasing Cu loading resulted in increasing photo activity as expected.Cu 2 O also served as electron trap to reduce the recombination rate of electron-hole pairs during photo excitation of photocatalyst.Surface hydroxyl (OH) of TiO 2 can promote the adsorption of reactant, CO 2 , so that photo reaction was enhanced 16.The amount of surface hydroxyl on TiO 2 increased with increasing Cu loading (Table 2).Thus the overall photo activity of CO 2 reduction significantly increased.However, excess Cu 2 O clusters on the surface also masked the surface of TiO 2 resulting in less light exposure of catalyst.Consequently the photo excitation of electron and hole pair was declined because less photo energy was absorbed.So there existed an optimum Cu loading on photo catalysts.An Cu loading of 1.2 wt was found be have the highest yields of methanol under our experimental conditions. The power of light intensity was calculated to be 0.5 in the methanol rate equation by linear regression.In general, photo activity is directly proportional to the light intensity.However, if light was over supplied than need like our experimental condition, the power of light intensity in the rate equation would shift from one to half."}, {"llm generation": "Solar", "source": "One of goals of this research is to develop a highly photo-efficient reactor for converting solar energy to chemical energy, such as, methanol from CO 2 via photo energy.", "context": "The catalytic reduction of CO 2 has great advantage over green plants of not having to support a living system.One of goals of this research is to develop a highly photo-efficient reactor for converting solar energy to chemical energy, such as, methanol from CO 2 via photo energy.In this study, the thickness of the films was near 53 nm after calcination at 500 C, and the average size of the nanocrystals in the TiO 2 film was near 14 nm.The photo reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O was successfully demonstrated in a photo reactor with Cu/TiO 2coated optical fibers.So far maximum methanol yield was 0.46 mole/g-cat-hr under UV irradiation.Optical fibers provide an uniform light distribution in a photo reactor that spreads light energy more efficiently than a traditional packed-bed reactor.In addition, a higher processing capacity is possible because the catalyst can disperse on a large external area of optical fibers in a given reactor volume.Furthermore, OFPR is a promising photo reactor that can be applied to any aqueous or gas-phase photo reaction.
