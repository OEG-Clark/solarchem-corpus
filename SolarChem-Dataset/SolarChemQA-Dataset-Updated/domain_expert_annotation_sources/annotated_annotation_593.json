The pristine TiO2 particles have a quasi nanocube-like morphology and a smooth surface with particle sizes in the range of 20-60 nm (Fig. 2a), which is similar to our previous observations 18,19.With adding 0.2 Sr 2 ions into the TiCl4 hydrothermal reaction solution, those nanocubes turn to short nanorod-like morphologies with slightly smaller width and some ultrafine nanoparticles attached on those nanorods' surfaces (Fig. 2b).Moreover, the number of ultrafine nanoparticles and the aspect ratio of nanorods increase along with enhancing the Sr 2 addition amount in the TiCl4 hydrothermal reaction solution (Fig. 2b-f). The TEM image (Fig. 3a from the FESEM image (Fig. 2d), in which those nanorods with 100 nm length and 20-30 nm width are surrounded by ultrafine nanoparticles with sizes smaller than 5 nm.The HRTEM image (Fig. 3d) and the corresponding Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) pattern (white solid pane in Fig. 3d) indicate that the single nanorod is also brookite TiO2, which is mainly shaped by the 210 exposed facets and grown along 001 orientation.After carefully checking those lattice fringes and FFT pattern (white dot pane in Fig. 3d) The survey XPS spectra (Fig. S2a) indicate that the pristine TiO2 exhibits Ti2p, O1s and C1s binding energy peaks and the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs composite has an additional weak Sr3d peak in addition to Ti2p, O1s and C1s peaks.The Ti2p regional high-resolution spectra (Fig. 4a) deliver two symmetrical peaks with binding energies of 458.5 and 464.4 eV in both pristine TiO2 and 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs, which correspond to Ti2p3/2 and Ti2p1/2 of Ti 4 37, respectively.There is no obvious shift and shoulder peak for the Ti2p regional spectrum of 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs, demonstrating that the chemical state of Ti element is simple and the Sr 2 ions may not dope into the TiO2 lattice at all.The O1s regional XPS spectra (Fig. 4b) show that the pristine TiO2 has a major peak with binding energy of 529.7 eV attributable to the O 2-ions in TiO2 lattice and a broad peak at 531.4 eV ascribable to the surface -OH group on TiO2 particles.The stronger -OH peak of 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs as compared to the pristine TiO2 implies the different surface states between the two products.The C1s XPS spectra (Fig. 4c) of both the pristine TiO2 and the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs can be deconvolved into three peaks at 289.0, 286.binding energy peaks at 134.5 and 132.8 eV 40.In addition, those Sr3d binding energy peaks of 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs composite disappeared after washed with diluted HNO3 solution (Fig. 4d).It indicates that the Sr species as SrCO3 only exist on the surfaces of TiO2 particles but not dope into TiO2 lattices.Similarly, the valence band XPS spectra (Fig. S2b) indicate that the pristine TiO2 and the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs composite have very similar valence bands, which also confirms the above conclusion that no Sr 2 -doping occurs during the present preparation process of the SrCO3/HPJs composites. The photocatalytic experiments demonstrate that CO/CH4 can be produced over those products in a gaseous CO2 photoreduction system containing H2O vapor under Xe-lamp irradiation, which is similar to our previous reports 181920.Control experiments show no reduced products of CO2 evolved without photocatalyst or CO2 gas, implying that those CO/CH4 reduced products are generated by the photocatalytic reaction processes.In addition, the main products in the present photoreaction systems are CO and CH4, and no other products such as CH3OH, C2H4 and C2H6 (using GC-FID method) or H2 (using GC-TCD ( where Vrea. is the volume of reactor; mcat. is the mass of the photocatalyst; tirr. is the irradiation time; cCO and cCH 4 are the produced CO and CH4 concentration, respectively.Of course, the H2, CH3OH and/or other reduced products (if any) should also be considered during the calculation of TCEN values.(Fig. 5a) with an overall photoactivity (TCEN) of 13.2 mol g -1 h -1 (Fig. 5b).Those SrCO3/HPJs composites, however, display obvious different photocatalytic activity and selectivity for the CH4/CO production.For example, the CH4 production activity of SrCO3/HPJs composites significantly increases from 0.79 to 19.66 mol g -1 h -1 along with enhancing the SrCO3-loading content from 0 to 1.0, while the CO production activity remains at a relatively low level with an unobvious change (Fig. 5a).It indicates that SrCO3/HPJs composites can achieve a much better activity and selectivity for CH4 production than that of pristine TiO2.Nevertheless, this increasing trend of photoactivity along with the SrCO3-loading content does not sustain when it is further increased from 4.0 to 10.Especially, the CH4/CO production activities (1.08/1.17mol g -1 h -1 ) and TCEN (11.9 mol g -1 h -1 ) of 10 SrCO3/HPJs composite are even lower than that of the pristine TiO2.It implies that excessive SrCO3 on TiO2 HPJs will be unfavorable for the CO2 photoreduction reactions.Consequently, the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs composite achieves CH4/CO production activities of 19.66/2.64mol g -1 h -1 with a maximum overall photoactivity (TCEN) of 162.6 mol g -1 h -1 , which is 12.3 times of the pristine TiO2 with a TCEN of 13.2 mol g -1 h -1 and CH4/CO production activities of 0.79/3.46mol g -1 h -1 .The CH4 production amount and the corresponding overall photoactivity (TCEN) for CO/CH4 production over the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs composite under a long term (10 h) irridiation are depicted in Fig. S3, which was conducted in a sealed gas-solid reactor connected to a GC with auto-injector, where the composition of the gas atmosphere was monitored with shorter intervals.As can be seen, the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs composite shows a continuous growth in the CH4 production amount in the initial 3 h, which then gradually gets smaller and stable in the following hours, while CO is mainly produced in the initial one hour, and gets slightly lower in the following hours, suggesting that CO is probably an intermediate product.Anyway, the continued growth trend of the CH4 production amount during the 10 h irridiation demonstrates that the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs composite has relatively good stability for the CO2 photoreduction. 14 Also, the photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity of the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs composite is influenced by the illumination intensity of Xe-lamp used, in which a silver reflector and UV coating are applied to adjust the exit light with wavelength longer than 330 nm, and the light with wavelength longer than 800 nm is cut by an infrared reflector to obtain a light spectrum shown in Fig. 6a.By varying the electric current, the illumination intensity can be adjusted, and a calibrated Si photodiode (SRC-1000-TC-QZ-N, Oriel) was used to measure the light intensity.As shown in Fig. 6b, a higher illumination intensity displays a better photoactivity for CO2 photoreduction, and the overall photoactivity (TCEN) is basically proportional to the light intensity when it is lower than 680 mW cm -2 .Among the two reduced products, the CO production rate reaches a platform at a relatively low illumination intensity (350 mW cm -2 ), while the CH4 production rate shows a growth trend along with the increase of the illumination intensity.Since the generation of one CH4 and CO molecule will consume 8 and 2 electrons, respectively, a low illumination intensity, which leads to a small amount of photogenerated electrons, is not beneficial for the CH4 generation.Under a high illumination intensity, the produced CO as an intermediate product can further react with the photogenerated electrons to form CH4, as a result, the CH4 production rate shows a growth trend along with the increase of the illumination intensity (Fig. 6b).Moreover, those CH4 production rate and TCEN curves dependent on the low light intensities can be extrapolated to the origin, which mean that there is no secondary reaction pathway other than photocatalysis in the present system. Since the UV-Vis diffuse reflectance absorption spectra (DRS, Fig. S4) indicate that the SrCO3 loading does not significantly affect the light absorption property of those composites, we started by determining their specific surface areas (SBET) by using liquid N2 adsorption-desorption experiments to explore the reasons of the significantly enhanced activity and selectivity of CO2 photoreduction to CH4.Although both the pristine TiO2 and the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs composite display typical type III isotherm with H3 hysteresis loop 18, the inflection of N2 adsorption branch of the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs composite starts at a relatively lower partial pressure than the pristine TiO2 (Fig. S5a).The corresponding Barret-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) pore size distribution plots determined from the desorption branches further reveal that the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs composite has a pore size distribution peak centered at 16.4 nm (Fig. S5b), much smaller than that (26.6 nm) of the pristine TiO2.As a result, the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs composite delivers a much larger SBET (106 m 2 g -1 ) than the pristine TiO2 (28.8 m 2 g -1 ).The much smaller pore size and larger surface area of the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs composite as compared to the pristine TiO2 can be due to the formation of ultrafine anatase nanoparticles and the aspect ratio changes of the brookite nanocubes after adding Sr 2 ions into the reaction solution as mentioned above.Nevertheless, the TCEN (1.53 mol m -2 h -1 ) per unit area of 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs composite is still 3.32 times of the pristine TiO2 (0.46 mol g -1 h -1 ) (Fig. 5b).It means that the increased SBET of the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs composite is not the only cause of the enhanced CO2 photoreduction activity as compared to the pristine TiO2. It has been reported that the anatase/rutile TiO2 HPJs can effectively improve the photoactivity mainly caused by the increase in photogenerated charge separation efficiency 41,42.In the present SrCO3/HPJs composite containing brookite and anatase, the enhanced CO2 photoreduction activity might be also ascribable to the TiO2 HPJs formed at the brookite/anatase interfaces since they also have different energy band structures 14,15.As mentioned above, the number of ultrafine anatase nanoparticles increases along with enhancing the Sr 2 addition amount in the TiCl4 reaction solution.Correspondingly, the increasing trend of photoactivity along with enhancing the SrCO3-loading content to 1.0 (Fig. 5) can be mainly due to the more interface HPJs formed among those brookite and anatase, while the decreased activity of the 4.0 SrCO3/HPJs composite implies that there is an optimal proportion among those brookite, anatase and SrCO3 phases. To further confirm this issue, the 1.0 BaCO3/HPJs composite was also synthesized through a similar method by using BaCl2 instead of SrCl2 not only because its SBET (161 m 2 g -1 ) is much larger than that (106 m 2 g -1 ) of the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs (Fig. S5a), but also because its relative content of the anatase nanoparticles is much higher than that of the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs as shown in Fig. S6 and3c).The XRD patterns (Fig. S7a) and Raman spectra (Fig. S7b) also demonstrate that the 1.0 BaCO3/HPJs composite is a brookite/anatase mixed phase but with much higher relative content of anatase nanoparticles as compared to the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs.These results demonstrate that Ba 2 ions instead of Sr 2 ions adding into the TiCl4 hydrothermal reaction solution would be more beneficial for the formation of anatase nanoparticles, which further lead to the higher surface area.Although the 1.0 BaCO3/HPJs composite exhibits better CO/CH4 production activities (6.55/15.78mol g -1 h -1 ) and TCEN (139.3 mol g -1 h -1 ) than the pristine TiO2 once again, but they are still lower than that of the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs composite (Fig. 5) even though it has a 16 much higher SBET than the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs.It implies that the larger surface area and higher anatase relative content of 1.0 BaCO3/HPJs do not contribute a better photoactivity than the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs. The above results reveal that the TiO2 HPJs formed at the anatase/brookite interfaces with an optimal proportion would be of importance for promoting the photogenerated charge separation efficiency and then the better activity of the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs.This assumption on the charge separation can be validated by the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the pristine TiO2 and SrCO3/HPJs composites shown in Fig. 7a.As seen, those emission peaks in the range of 350-550 nm can be attributed to the bandgap excitation of TiO2, and significant PL quenching can be observed from those SrCO3/HPJs composites.It was reported that the valence band (CB) of brookite TiO2 is higher than that of anatase TiO2, (-0.96 vs. -0.91 eV) 10.Probably, the higher photoactivity is mainly caused by the increase in photogenerated charge separation efficiency resulting from interfacial electron transfer from brookite to anatase, and thus resulting in a suppression of the direct photoexcited charge recombination 41424344. To make clear the role of the SrCO3 in those SrCO3/HPJs composites, the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs composite was washed by diluted HNO3 solution followed by washing with distilled H2O several times to completely remove the SrCO3 on the TiO2 surfaces.As shown in Fig. 4d, the washed 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs composite has no obvious Sr3d binding energy peaks, indicating SrCO3 can be completely removed, and the remained matter should be single brookite/anatase TiO2 HPJs.Although the washed 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs composite shows an obviously decreased activity as compared to the unwashed one (Fig. S8), it still delivers much better activity than the pristine TiO2.Since a significant PL quenching can be observed for washed product as compared to the pristine TiO2 (Fig. 7a), it can be concluded that its better activity is also mainly caused by the TiO2 HPJs through promoting the photogenerated charge separation at the brookite/anatase interfaces 41424344.After reloading with 1.0 SrCO3, the washed product delivers an enhanced CO2 reduction activity but still lower than the original one (Fig. S8).However, those 1.0SrCO3 or Sr(NO3)2 loaded pristine TiO2 only show very limited enhancement in the activity.These results demonstrate that only the larger specific surface area or the TiO2 heterophase junction effect may not lead to such a preferable result of the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs composite, and the synergistic effects of the TiO2 HPJs and SrCO3 species cause the significantly enhanced activity and selectivity for CO2 photoreduction to CH4. The CO2 temperature-programmed desorption (CO2-TPD) curves (Fig. 7b), from which the adsorption amount and strength of catalysts can be surveyed, indicate that the pristine TiO2 mainly exhibits three CO2 desorption peaks.The TPD peak in the temperature range of 60-120 oC may be related to the CO2 desorption from the physical adsorption sites on the brookite TiO2, the TPD peak in the range of 180-340 oC may be attributable to the CO2 desorption from weak adsorbed bicarbonates, and the broad peak beyond 350 oC may stem from to the decomposition of the strongly adsorbed carbonates on the brookite TiO2 454647.Those SrCO3/HPJs composites display much stronger TPD peak signals at the low temperature region than the pristine TiO2, indicating that the physically adsorbed CO2 amount on those SrCO3/HPJs composites are much higher than that on the pristine TiO2, which is probably due to the higher specific surface area of those SrCO3/HPJs composites.Moreover, the SrCO3/HPJs composites with low SrCO3-loading contents (0.4 and 1.0) display a dramatically increased TPD peak in a higher temperature region (210-380 oC) as compared to the pristine TiO2 (180-340 oC), implying that the chemical combination of the adsorbed CO2 molecules on those SrCO3/HPJs composites are stronger and more substantial.Also, the additional TPD peak in the range of 380-530 oC for those SrCO3/HPJs composites may result from different combination modes of CO2 on the TiO2 HPJs.Since the washed SrCO3/HPJs composite has no any TPD signal at the two temperature regions (Fig. 7b), it can be concluded that the co-existence of SrCO3 species may promote the CO2 adsorption on the TiO2 HPJs.However, excessive SrCO3 loading (10) causes those TPD peaks in the ranges of 210-380 oC and 380-530 oC shifting to lower temperature regions, which may be ascribed to the excessive SrCO3 occupying those adsorption sites of the A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T 18 TiO2 HPJs.The above results demonstrate that the SrCO3 species with suitable content would significantly enhance the CO2 adsorption on the TiO2 HPJs, and the stronger combination between CO2 molecules and TiO2 HPJs may be a benefit to the activation of CO2 and then to the enhanced photoactivity. The in situ DRIFTS IR spectra (Fig. 8) reveal the different CO2/H2O adsorption behaviors existing among the pristine TiO2 and the SrCO3/HPJs composites with/without light irradiation.Before irradiation, the pristine TiO2 exhibits strong bands in the ranges of 3715-3753 cm -1 and 3670-3715 cm -1 (Fig. 8a), which can be attributed to the IR absorbance of -OH groups on the surface Ti 3 and Ti 4 sites 19,20,48,49, respectively.However, the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs composite displays a much lower IR absorbance (3670-3715 cm -1 ) of Ti 4 -OH than the pristine TiO2, which becomes stronger again for the 10 SrCO3/HPJs and the washed 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs.Therefore, it can be conjectured that the CO2 molecules may principally occupied the Ti 4 sites and a small amount of SrCO3 loading may help this process, while excessive SrCO3 cannot cause this effect possibly due to the surface Ti 4 sites occupied by SrCO3 species.This assumption on the excessive SrCO3 retards the surface CO2 adsorption on the TiO2 HPJs can be confirmed by the DRIFTS IR spectra in the range of 2000-1200 cm -1 (Fig. 8b).The pristine TiO2 surfaces are dominated by strongly adsorbed H2O at 1635 cm -1 , bidentate carbonates (b-CO3 2-) at 1579 and 1334 cm -1 , and weak monodentate carbonates (m-CO3 2-) at 1518 and 1395 cm -1 45,484950.After modified with SrCO3, the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs composite displays shoulder IR peaks at 1673 and 1249 cm -1 , which can be assigned to the Ti-CO2 -species 50.Once again, the higher SrCO3-loading content (10) does not hold these IR absorption results.Probably, excessive SrCO3 would retard the formation of CO2 -species on the TiO2 BHJs. The formation of Ti-CO2 -indicates that the electrons could be spontaneously attached to CO2 from the defective TiO2 even in the dark, which is consistent with the previous result 50.Moreover, the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs composite displays a new peak at 1475 cm -1 and an unobvious shoulder at 1690 cm -1 , ascribable to the HCO3 -species, which are generated by CO2 -interaction with surface OH groups 48,50. It is consistent with the observation that the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs displays a much lower IR absorbance (3670-3715 cm -1 ) of Ti 4 -OH than the pristine TiO2 and demonstrates that CO2 molecules tends to combine with surface OH groups to form HCO3 -species on the TiO2 BHJs.After light irradiation for 30 min, the IR bands in the range of 3670-3753 cm -1 keep a changing trend similar to that of those samples in the dark (Fig. 8a andc), illustrating that the surface OH adsorption is not significantly affected by irradiation.However, the pristine TiO2 after illumination exhibits obviously increased m-CO3 2-at 1395 cm -1 and b-CO3 2-at 1334 cm -1 (Fig. 8d), which usually leads to a tendency of CO production during the CO2 photoreduction 19,20,484950.It is consistent with the above result that the pristine TiO2 produces CO as the major product (Fig. 5a).By contrast, the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs after irradiation exhibits much lower IR peaks of m-CO3 2-at 1395 cm -1 and b-CO3 2-at 1334 cm -1 but with evident peaks at 1690 and 1475 cm -1 appeared, which may be attributed to the HCO3 -species 48,50, illustrating that the HCO3 -is the main species for the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs under illumination.As a result, the CH4 selectivity during the CO2 photoreduction processes is enhanced as shown in Fig 5 .Moreover, the shoulder peaks at 1716 cm -1 can be assigned to HCOOH 48,50, which may be one of the intermediates occurred under illumination.The above results suggest that HCO3 -and HCOOH are possibly the major Generally, the photocatalytic performance and product kinds for CO2 reduction strongly depend on the photocatalyst and its experimental conditions, and the overall photoactivity of various CO2 photoreaction systems only can be compared using the above-mentioned TCEN values, which can be calculated using equation ( 1) according to the corresponding products.Since there are extraordinary variety of photocatalysts and their photoreaction systems for CO2 reduction as mentioned in our previous literatures 2,3, herein, our result was just compared with some recently reported results on TiO2 or TiO2-based photocatalysts as shown in Table S1.As seen, the current SrCO3/HPJs composite shows a relatively higher overall photoactivity (TCEN) compared to most of the results reported in those recent literatures.Metals (including noble metals or transition metals) and/or their oxidized species have been widely used as cocatalysts for the CO2 photoreduction.Usually, these cocatalysts with Fermi levels below the CB bottom of TiO2 can form Schottky barrier at TiO2/cocatalyst interface, and thus promote the photogenerated charge separation and then the multielectron reaction process of CO2 photoreduction.Nevertheless, it is not the best way for the selectivity of CO2 photoreduction reactions because of the competition reaction of H2 generation, especially for those noble metal-based cocatalysts as shown in Table S1.Owing to the similar photocatalytic mechanisms, an excellent photocatalyst for CO2 reduction is usually also perform well for H2 generation especially for the situation in the presence of noble metal cocatalysts.Therefore, it is especially important to improve the selectivity for solar fuel generation as compared to H2 generation and other photochemical conversion.In addition to the overall photoactivity, fabrication cost and application prospect should also be considered during the development of CO2 photoreduction systems.In this regard, we think the present SrCO3/TiO2 HPJs should be a promising photocatalyst for CO2 photoreduction due to its low-cost cocatalyst, easy fabrication and relatively high photocatalytic performance. On the other hand, many researches have demonstrated that the surface engineering is a suitable way to face the above problem sine it can adjust the adsorbed behavior of CO2 and H2O on the catalyst surface. The present SrCO3/HPJs composite can improve the CO2/H2O adsorption ability and act as an efficient synergistic catalyst to promote the CH4 production, and thus cause a significantly enhanced activity and reduction with H2O.Therefore, we believe that applied SrCO3 can expand the concepts of synergetic catalysts towards high activity and selectivity beyond the metal or metal oxides as cocatalysts. On the bases of the above results and discussion, it can be concluded that there are at least three possible facts causing the significantly enhanced activity and selectivity of CO2 photoreduction to CH4 over the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs composite as compared the pristine TiO2.Firstly, the increasing surface area will increase the adsorptive sites of CO2 molecules, and finally results in the enhanced photoactivity for CO2 photoreduction; Secondly, the TiO2 heterophase junctions in the SrCO3/HPJs composites can promote the photogenerated charge separation due to the different energy band structures between brookite nanorods and anatase nanoparticles; Thirdly, suitable SrCO3 amount on the TiO2 HPJs can boost the interaction between the adsorbed CO2 molecules and the TiO2 HPJs surface to form HCO3 -and decrease the activation energy of CO2 under illumination, and thus promote the CH4 selectivity during the CO2 photoreduction processes.Namely, the synergistic effects of the brookite/anatase TiO2 HPJs and the SrCO3 species cause the significantly enhanced activity and selectivity for CO2 photoreduction to CH4 of the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs composite."}, {"llm generation": "UV-Vis", "source": "In situ DRIFTS IR spectra of the pristine TiO2 and the SrCO3/HPJs composites with different SrCO3-loading contents before (a, b) and after UV-Vis light irradiation for 30 min (c, d).", "context": "In summary, a series of SrCO3-modified TiO2-based composites have been synthesized through a one-pot hydrothermal method using TiCl4 as raw material.It is found that introducing Sr 2 ions into the -ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were acquired by using Miniflex 600 X-ray diffractometer with Cu K radiation ( 0.154 nm) at 40 kV and 15 mA.The scan rate was set as 4 min -1 from 10-50 with a step of 0.02.The morphology was investigated with Zeiss-Sigma field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM).The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) observation was conducted on a LaB6 JEM-2100 (HR) electron microscope (JEOL Ltd.) working at 200 kV.Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms at 77 K were measured on a Micrometrics ASAP 2010 system after the samples were degassed at 120 C.UV-Vis diffuse reflectance absorption spectra (DRS) were obtained by a Cary 5000 spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere with BaSO4 as the reference (Agilent Inc., U.S.).X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were recorded on an ESCALAB 250Xi X-ray photoelectron spectroscope (Thermo Fisher) equipped with a standard and monochromatic source (Al K, 1486.6 eV).Raman spectra were obtained by an RM-1000 Confocal Raman Microspectroscopy (Renishaw Co., Ltd) with an excitation wavelength of 514.5 nm.Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were obtained on a Hitachi F-4600 fluorimeter with an exciting wavelength of 290 nm.Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra were recorded at room temperature on Bruker EPR spectrometer operated at 9.419 GHz.The CO2 temperature programmed desorption (CO2-TPD) curves are obtained by using Micromeritics Autochem 2.

The photocatalytic reduction of CO2 with H2O was carried out in an enclosed glass reactor under a 300 W Xe-lamp irradiation.Typically, 60 mg of photocatalyst was uniformly dispersed on a watch glass with an area of 28 cm 2 , which then put on a holder in the reactor with the total volume of 500 mL.1.60 g of NaHCO3 was introduced on the bottom of the reactor as the source of CO2.Before irradiation, the air was completely removed with a vacuum treated.5.0 mL of H2SO4 solution (40) was then injected with a syringe to produce the CO2 and H2O vapor.During the irradiation, 2 mL of gas was taken out from the reactor at regular intervals (1 h) and analyzed by a gas chromatograph (SP-7820, TDX-01 column, Rainbow chemical instrument Co., Ltd) equipped with a flame ionized detector (FID) and methanizer.The amounts of the products were calibrated by external standardization method using a commercial standard gas mixture.addition amount (Fig. 1a).Further enhancing the Sr 2 addition amount to 4.0 and 10, however, some new diffraction peaks in addition to those brookite diffraction peaks can be observed at 2 29.7,35.2, 36.6,41.3 and 44.2, which can be ascribable to the reflections of (002), ( 200), ( 130), ( 220) and (221) planes of orthorhombic SrCO3 (JCPDS No. 05-0418) 31,32, respectively.Moreover, those SrCO3 diffraction peaks show an increasing trend along with enhancing the Sr 2 addition amount.It implies that SrCO3 may also form in those products hydrothermally derived from the TiCl4 solutions with Sr 2 addition amount at lower molar percentages ( 1.0), and the difficulty to observe the corresponding diffraction peaks may be due to the low loading content and/or high dispersity of SrCO3 in those SrCO3/HPJs composites.In addition, the positions of brookite diffraction peaks of those SrCO3/HPJs composites remain unchanged compared to the pristine TiO2 as shown in the XRD patterns at the range of 2 24-32 (Fig. S1a), and no oxygen vacancy signal can be observed from the EPR spectra (Fig. S1b).These results demonstrate that there is no obvious Sr 2 -doping in the brookite lattice during the present preparation processes 33.With addition of Sr 2 ions into the TiCl4 solution, the (210), ( 111 (Fig. 1b) are used to explore the crystal phase purity of those SrCO3/HPJs composites.According to the previous reports 34,35, brookite lattice with D2h symmetry has 15 Raman active vibration bands, including A1g (155, 194, 247, 412 and 636 cm -1 ), B1g (213, 322 and 501 cm -1 ), B2g (366, 395, 460 and 583 cm -1 ), and B3g (172, 287 and 545 cm -1 ) modes, among the 69 possible optical modes (9A1g 9B1g 9B2g 9B3g 9A1u 8B1u 8B2u 8B3u) 18,34; whereas anatase only has 6 active bands in the Raman shift range of 100-700 cm -1 such as 3Eg (144, 197 and 639 cm -1 ), 2B1g (399 and 519 cm -1 ) and A1g (513 cm -1 ).As shown in Fig. 1b, the pristine TiO2 shows a Raman spectrum matching well to the above-mentioned standard modes with no anatase peak observable at the corresponding location, implying that the pristine TiO2 is brookite with a high phase purity."}, {"llm generation": "Xenon (Xe-lamp)", "source": "The photocatalytic experiments demonstrate that CO/CH4 can be produced over those products in a gaseous CO2 photoreduction system containing H2O vapor under Xe-lamp irradiation, which is similar to our previous reports 181920.", "context": "Although 0.4 SrCO3/HPJs composite exhibits a Raman spectrum very similar to the pristine TiO2, some inconspicuous changes can be observed at the characteristic positions of anatase TiO2.As for those SrCO3/HPJs composites with 1.0 and higher SrCO3-loading contents, three anatase characteristic bands can be observed from those Raman spectra (Fig. 1b), which show relatively weaker Raman peaks of brookite as compared to the pristine TiO2.Among which, the broad Raman peak at 515 cm -1 is generated by combination of B1g and A1g of anatase TiO2, while the main peak at 155 cm -1 for the pristine TiO2 shifts to 146 cm -1 , which is close to the Eg peak (144 cm -1 ) of anatase TiO2 18,34.The above results demonstrate that the addition of Sr 2 ions into the TiCl4 reaction solution leads to the phase transformation of some orthorombic brookite toward tetragonal anatase to form TiO2-based composites containing SrCO3, anatase and brookite TiO2 with their relative contents changed along with the Sr 2 ions addition amount in the hydrothermal reaction solution. The FESEM images of the pristine TiO2 and the SrCO3/HPJs composites with different SrCO3-loading contents are shown in Fig. 2. The pristine TiO2 particles have a quasi nanocube-like morphology and a smooth surface with particle sizes in the range of 20-60 nm (Fig. 2a), which is similar to our previous observations 18,19.With adding 0.2 Sr 2 ions into the TiCl4 hydrothermal reaction solution, those nanocubes turn to short nanorod-like morphologies with slightly smaller width and some ultrafine nanoparticles attached on those nanorods' surfaces (Fig. 2b).Moreover, the number of ultrafine nanoparticles and the aspect ratio of nanorods increase along with enhancing the Sr 2 addition amount in the TiCl4 hydrothermal reaction solution (Fig. 2b-f). The TEM image (Fig. 3a from the FESEM image (Fig. 2d), in which those nanorods with 100 nm length and 20-30 nm width are surrounded by ultrafine nanoparticles with sizes smaller than 5 nm.The HRTEM image (Fig. 3d) and the corresponding Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) pattern (white solid pane in Fig. 3d) indicate that the single nanorod is also brookite TiO2, which is mainly shaped by the 210 exposed facets and grown along 001 orientation.After carefully checking those lattice fringes and FFT pattern (white dot pane in Fig. 3d) The survey XPS spectra (Fig. S2a) indicate that the pristine TiO2 exhibits Ti2p, O1s and C1s binding energy peaks and the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs composite has an additional weak Sr3d peak in addition to Ti2p, O1s and C1s peaks.The Ti2p regional high-resolution spectra (Fig. 4a) deliver two symmetrical peaks with binding energies of 458.5 and 464.4 eV in both pristine TiO2 and 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs, which correspond to Ti2p3/2 and Ti2p1/2 of Ti 4 37, respectively.There is no obvious shift and shoulder peak for the Ti2p regional spectrum of 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs, demonstrating that the chemical state of Ti element is simple and the Sr 2 ions may not dope into the TiO2 lattice at all.The O1s regional XPS spectra (Fig. 4b) show that the pristine TiO2 has a major peak with binding energy of 529.7 eV attributable to the O 2-ions in TiO2 lattice and a broad peak at 531.4 eV ascribable to the surface -OH group on TiO2 particles.The stronger -OH peak of 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs as compared to the pristine TiO2 implies the different surface states between the two products.The C1s XPS spectra (Fig. 4c) of both the pristine TiO2 and the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs can be deconvolved into three peaks at 289.0, 286.binding energy peaks at 134.5 and 132.8 eV 40.In addition, those Sr3d binding energy peaks of 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs composite disappeared after washed with diluted HNO3 solution (Fig. 4d).It indicates that the Sr species as SrCO3 only exist on the surfaces of TiO2 particles but not dope into TiO2 lattices.Similarly, the valence band XPS spectra (Fig. S2b) indicate that the pristine TiO2 and the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs composite have very similar valence bands, which also confirms the above conclusion that no Sr 2 -doping occurs during the present preparation process of the SrCO3/HPJs composites. The photocatalytic experiments demonstrate that CO/CH4 can be produced over those products in a gaseous CO2 photoreduction system containing H2O vapor under Xe-lamp irradiation, which is similar to our previous reports 181920.Control experiments show no reduced products of CO2 evolved without photocatalyst or CO2 gas, implying that those CO/CH4 reduced products are generated by the photocatalytic reaction processes.In addition, the main products in the present photoreaction systems are CO and CH4, and no other products such as CH3OH, C2H4 and C2H6 (using GC-FID method) or H2 (using GC-TCD ( where Vrea. is the volume of reactor; mcat. is the mass of the photocatalyst; tirr. is the irradiation time; cCO and cCH 4 are the produced CO and CH4 concentration, respectively.Of course, the H2, CH3OH and/or other reduced products (if any) should also be considered during the calculation of TCEN values.(Fig. 5a) with an overall photoactivity (TCEN) of 13.2 mol g -1 h -1 (Fig. 5b).Those SrCO3/HPJs composites, however, display obvious different photocatalytic activity and selectivity for the CH4/CO production.For example, the CH4 production activity of SrCO3/HPJs composites significantly increases from 0.79 to 19.66 mol g -1 h -1 along with enhancing the SrCO3-loading content from 0 to 1.0, while the CO production activity remains at a relatively low level with an unobvious change (Fig. 5a).It indicates that SrCO3/HPJs composites can achieve a much better activity and selectivity for CH4 production than that of pristine TiO2.Nevertheless, this increasing trend of photoactivity along with the SrCO3-loading content does not sustain when it is further increased from 4.0 to 10.Especially, the CH4/CO production activities (1.08/1.17mol g -1 h -1 ) and TCEN (11.9 mol g -1 h -1 ) of 10 SrCO3/HPJs composite are even lower than that of the pristine TiO2.It implies that excessive SrCO3 on TiO2 HPJs will be unfavorable for the CO2 photoreduction reactions.Consequently, the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs composite achieves CH4/CO production activities of 19.66/2.64mol g -1 h -1 with a maximum overall photoactivity (TCEN) of 162.6 mol g -1 h -1 , which is 12.3 times of the pristine TiO2 with a TCEN of 13.2 mol g -1 h -1 and CH4/CO production activities of 0.79/3.46mol g -1 h -1 .The CH4 production amount and the corresponding overall photoactivity (TCEN) for CO/CH4 production over the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs composite under a long term (10 h) irridiation are depicted in Fig. S3, which was conducted in a sealed gas-solid reactor connected to a GC with auto-injector, where the composition of the gas atmosphere was monitored with shorter intervals.As can be seen, the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs composite shows a continuous growth in the CH4 production amount in the initial 3 h, which then gradually gets smaller and stable in the following hours, while CO is mainly produced in the initial one hour, and gets slightly lower in the following hours, suggesting that CO is probably an intermediate product.Anyway, the continued growth trend of the CH4 production amount during the 10 h irridiation demonstrates that the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs composite has relatively good stability for the CO2 photoreduction. 14 Also, the photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity of the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs composite is influenced by the illumination intensity of Xe-lamp used, in which a silver reflector and UV coating are applied to adjust the exit light with wavelength longer than 330 nm, and the light with wavelength longer than 800 nm is cut by an infrared reflector to obtain a light spectrum shown in Fig. 6a.By varying the electric current, the illumination intensity can be adjusted, and a calibrated Si photodiode (SRC-1000-TC-QZ-N, Oriel) was used to measure the light intensity.As shown in Fig. 6b, a higher illumination intensity displays a better photoactivity for CO2 photoreduction, and the overall photoactivity (TCEN) is basically proportional to the light intensity when it is lower than 680 mW cm -2 .Among the two reduced products, the CO production rate reaches a platform at a relatively low illumination intensity (350 mW cm -2 ), while the CH4 production rate shows a growth trend along with the increase of the illumination intensity.Since the generation of one CH4 and CO molecule will consume 8 and 2 electrons, respectively, a low illumination intensity, which leads to a small amount of photogenerated electrons, is not beneficial for the CH4 generation.Under a high illumination intensity, the produced CO as an intermediate product can further react with the photogenerated electrons to form CH4, as a result, the CH4 production rate shows a growth trend along with the increase of the illumination intensity (Fig. 6b).Moreover, those CH4 production rate and TCEN curves dependent on the low light intensities can be extrapolated to the origin, which mean that there is no secondary reaction pathway other than photocatalysis in the present system. Since the UV-Vis diffuse reflectance absorption spectra (DRS, Fig. S4) indicate that the SrCO3 loading does not significantly affect the light absorption property of those composites, we started by determining their specific surface areas (SBET) by using liquid N2 adsorption-desorption experiments to explore the reasons of the significantly enhanced activity and selectivity of CO2 photoreduction to CH4.Although both the pristine TiO2 and the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs composite display typical type III isotherm with H3 hysteresis loop 18, the inflection of N2 adsorption branch of the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs composite starts at a relatively lower partial pressure than the pristine TiO2 (Fig. S5a).The corresponding Barret-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) pore size distribution plots determined from the desorption branches further reveal that the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs composite has a pore size distribution peak centered at 16.4 nm (Fig. S5b), much smaller than that (26.6 nm) of the pristine TiO2.As a result, the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs composite delivers a much larger SBET (106 m 2 g -1 ) than the pristine TiO2 (28.8 m 2 g -1 ).The much smaller pore size and larger surface area of the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs composite as compared to the pristine TiO2 can be due to the formation of ultrafine anatase nanoparticles and the aspect ratio changes of the brookite nanocubes after adding Sr 2 ions into the reaction solution as mentioned above.Nevertheless, the TCEN (1.53 mol m -2 h -1 ) per unit area of 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs composite is still 3.32 times of the pristine TiO2 (0.46 mol g -1 h -1 ) (Fig. 5b).It means that the increased SBET of the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs composite is not the only cause of the enhanced CO2 photoreduction activity as compared to the pristine TiO2. It has been reported that the anatase/rutile TiO2 HPJs can effectively improve the photoactivity mainly caused by the increase in photogenerated charge separation efficiency 41,42.In the present SrCO3/HPJs composite containing brookite and anatase, the enhanced CO2 photoreduction activity might be also ascribable to the TiO2 HPJs formed at the brookite/anatase interfaces since they also have different energy band structures 14,15.As mentioned above, the number of ultrafine anatase nanoparticles increases along with enhancing the Sr 2 addition amount in the TiCl4 reaction solution.Correspondingly, the increasing trend of photoactivity along with enhancing the SrCO3-loading content to 1.0 (Fig. 5) can be mainly due to the more interface HPJs formed among those brookite and anatase, while the decreased activity of the 4.0 SrCO3/HPJs composite implies that there is an optimal proportion among those brookite, anatase and SrCO3 phases. To further confirm this issue, the 1.0 BaCO3/HPJs composite was also synthesized through a similar method by using BaCl2 instead of SrCl2 not only because its SBET (161 m 2 g -1 ) is much larger than that (106 m 2 g -1 ) of the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs (Fig. S5a), but also because its relative content of the anatase nanoparticles is much higher than that of the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs as shown in Fig. S6 and3c).The XRD patterns (Fig. S7a) and Raman spectra (Fig. S7b) also demonstrate that the 1.0 BaCO3/HPJs composite is a brookite/anatase mixed phase but with much higher relative content of anatase nanoparticles as compared to the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs.These results demonstrate that Ba 2 ions instead of Sr 2 ions adding into the TiCl4 hydrothermal reaction solution would be more beneficial for the formation of anatase nanoparticles, which further lead to the higher surface area.Although the 1.0 BaCO3/HPJs composite exhibits better CO/CH4 production activities (6.55/15.78mol g -1 h -1 ) and TCEN (139.3 mol g -1 h -1 ) than the pristine TiO2 once again, but they are still lower than that of the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs composite (Fig. 5) even though it has a 16 much higher SBET than the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs.It implies that the larger surface area and higher anatase relative content of 1.0 BaCO3/HPJs do not contribute a better photoactivity than the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs. The above results reveal that the TiO2 HPJs formed at the anatase/brookite interfaces with an optimal proportion would be of importance for promoting the photogenerated charge separation efficiency and then the better activity of the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs.This assumption on the charge separation can be validated by the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the pristine TiO2 and SrCO3/HPJs composites shown in Fig. 7a.As seen, those emission peaks in the range of 350-550 nm can be attributed to the bandgap excitation of TiO2, and significant PL quenching can be observed from those SrCO3/HPJs composites.It was reported that the valence band (CB) of brookite TiO2 is higher than that of anatase TiO2, (-0.96 vs. -0.91 eV) 10.Probably, the higher photoactivity is mainly caused by the increase in photogenerated charge separation efficiency resulting from interfacial electron transfer from brookite to anatase, and thus resulting in a suppression of the direct photoexcited charge recombination 41424344. To make clear the role of the SrCO3 in those SrCO3/HPJs composites, the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs composite was washed by diluted HNO3 solution followed by washing with distilled H2O several times to completely remove the SrCO3 on the TiO2 surfaces.As shown in Fig. 4d, the washed 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs composite has no obvious Sr3d binding energy peaks, indicating SrCO3 can be completely removed, and the remained matter should be single brookite/anatase TiO2 HPJs.Although the washed 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs composite shows an obviously decreased activity as compared to the unwashed one (Fig. S8), it still delivers much better activity than the pristine TiO2.Since a significant PL quenching can be observed for washed product as compared to the pristine TiO2 (Fig. 7a), it can be concluded that its better activity is also mainly caused by the TiO2 HPJs through promoting the photogenerated charge separation at the brookite/anatase interfaces 41424344.After reloading with 1.0 SrCO3, the washed product delivers an enhanced CO2 reduction activity but still lower than the original one (Fig. S8).However, those 1.0SrCO3 or Sr(NO3)2 loaded pristine TiO2 only show very limited enhancement in the activity.These results demonstrate that only the larger specific surface area or the TiO2 heterophase junction effect may not lead to such a preferable result of the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs composite, and the synergistic effects of the TiO2 HPJs and SrCO3 species cause the significantly enhanced activity and selectivity for CO2 photoreduction to CH4. The CO2 temperature-programmed desorption (CO2-TPD) curves (Fig. 7b), from which the adsorption amount and strength of catalysts can be surveyed, indicate that the pristine TiO2 mainly exhibits three CO2 desorption peaks.The TPD peak in the temperature range of 60-120 oC may be related to the CO2 desorption from the physical adsorption sites on the brookite TiO2, the TPD peak in the range of 180-340 oC may be attributable to the CO2 desorption from weak adsorbed bicarbonates, and the broad peak beyond 350 oC may stem from to the decomposition of the strongly adsorbed carbonates on the brookite TiO2 454647.Those SrCO3/HPJs composites display much stronger TPD peak signals at the low temperature region than the pristine TiO2, indicating that the physically adsorbed CO2 amount on those SrCO3/HPJs composites are much higher than that on the pristine TiO2, which is probably due to the higher specific surface area of those SrCO3/HPJs composites.Moreover, the SrCO3/HPJs composites with low SrCO3-loading contents (0.4 and 1.0) display a dramatically increased TPD peak in a higher temperature region (210-380 oC) as compared to the pristine TiO2 (180-340 oC), implying that the chemical combination of the adsorbed CO2 molecules on those SrCO3/HPJs composites are stronger and more substantial.Also, the additional TPD peak in the range of 380-530 oC for those SrCO3/HPJs composites may result from different combination modes of CO2 on the TiO2 HPJs.Since the washed SrCO3/HPJs composite has no any TPD signal at the two temperature regions (Fig. 7b), it can be concluded that the co-existence of SrCO3 species may promote the CO2 adsorption on the TiO2 HPJs.However, excessive SrCO3 loading (10) causes those TPD peaks in the ranges of 210-380 oC and 380-530 oC shifting to lower temperature regions, which may be ascribed to the excessive SrCO3 occupying those adsorption sites of the A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T 18 TiO2 HPJs.The above results demonstrate that the SrCO3 species with suitable content would significantly enhance the CO2 adsorption on the TiO2 HPJs, and the stronger combination between CO2 molecules and TiO2 HPJs may be a benefit to the activation of CO2 and then to the enhanced photoactivity. The in situ DRIFTS IR spectra (Fig. 8) reveal the different CO2/H2O adsorption behaviors existing among the pristine TiO2 and the SrCO3/HPJs composites with/without light irradiation.Before irradiation, the pristine TiO2 exhibits strong bands in the ranges of 3715-3753 cm -1 and 3670-3715 cm -1 (Fig. 8a), which can be attributed to the IR absorbance of -OH groups on the surface Ti 3 and Ti 4 sites 19,20,48,49, respectively.However, the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs composite displays a much lower IR absorbance (3670-3715 cm -1 ) of Ti 4 -OH than the pristine TiO2, which becomes stronger again for the 10 SrCO3/HPJs and the washed 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs.Therefore, it can be conjectured that the CO2 molecules may principally occupied the Ti 4 sites and a small amount of SrCO3 loading may help this process, while excessive SrCO3 cannot cause this effect possibly due to the surface Ti 4 sites occupied by SrCO3 species.This assumption on the excessive SrCO3 retards the surface CO2 adsorption on the TiO2 HPJs can be confirmed by the DRIFTS IR spectra in the range of 2000-1200 cm -1 (Fig. 8b).The pristine TiO2 surfaces are dominated by strongly adsorbed H2O at 1635 cm -1 , bidentate carbonates (b-CO3 2-) at 1579 and 1334 cm -1 , and weak monodentate carbonates (m-CO3 2-) at 1518 and 1395 cm -1 45,484950.After modified with SrCO3, the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs composite displays shoulder IR peaks at 1673 and 1249 cm -1 , which can be assigned to the Ti-CO2 -species 50.Once again, the higher SrCO3-loading content (10) does not hold these IR absorption results.Probably, excessive SrCO3 would retard the formation of CO2 -species on the TiO2 BHJs. The formation of Ti-CO2 -indicates that the electrons could be spontaneously attached to CO2 from the defective TiO2 even in the dark, which is consistent with the previous result 50.Moreover, the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs composite displays a new peak at 1475 cm -1 and an unobvious shoulder at 1690 cm -1 , ascribable to the HCO3 -species, which are generated by CO2 -interaction with surface OH groups 48,50. It is consistent with the observation that the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs displays a much lower IR absorbance (3670-3715 cm -1 ) of Ti 4 -OH than the pristine TiO2 and demonstrates that CO2 molecules tends to combine with surface OH groups to form HCO3 -species on the TiO2 BHJs.After light irradiation for 30 min, the IR bands in the range of 3670-3753 cm -1 keep a changing trend similar to that of those samples in the dark (Fig. 8a andc), illustrating that the surface OH adsorption is not significantly affected by irradiation.However, the pristine TiO2 after illumination exhibits obviously increased m-CO3 2-at 1395 cm -1 and b-CO3 2-at 1334 cm -1 (Fig. 8d), which usually leads to a tendency of CO production during the CO2 photoreduction 19,20,484950.It is consistent with the above result that the pristine TiO2 produces CO as the major product (Fig. 5a).By contrast, the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs after irradiation exhibits much lower IR peaks of m-CO3 2-at 1395 cm -1 and b-CO3 2-at 1334 cm -1 but with evident peaks at 1690 and 1475 cm -1 appeared, which may be attributed to the HCO3 -species 48,50, illustrating that the HCO3 -is the main species for the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs under illumination.As a result, the CH4 selectivity during the CO2 photoreduction processes is enhanced as shown in Fig 5 .Moreover, the shoulder peaks at 1716 cm -1 can be assigned to HCOOH 48,50, which may be one of the intermediates occurred under illumination.The above results suggest that HCO3 -and HCOOH are possibly the major Generally, the photocatalytic performance and product kinds for CO2 reduction strongly depend on the photocatalyst and its experimental conditions, and the overall photoactivity of various CO2 photoreaction systems only can be compared using the above-mentioned TCEN values, which can be calculated using equation ( 1) according to the corresponding products.Since there are extraordinary variety of photocatalysts and their photoreaction systems for CO2 reduction as mentioned in our previous literatures 2,3, herein, our result was just compared with some recently reported results on TiO2 or TiO2-based photocatalysts as shown in Table S1.As seen, the current SrCO3/HPJs composite shows a relatively higher overall photoactivity (TCEN) compared to most of the results reported in those recent literatures.Metals (including noble metals or transition metals) and/or their oxidized species have been widely used as cocatalysts for the CO2 photoreduction.Usually, these cocatalysts with Fermi levels below the CB bottom of TiO2 can form Schottky barrier at TiO2/cocatalyst interface, and thus promote the photogenerated charge separation and then the multielectron reaction process of CO2 photoreduction.Nevertheless, it is not the best way for the selectivity of CO2 photoreduction reactions because of the competition reaction of H2 generation, especially for those noble metal-based cocatalysts as shown in Table S1.Owing to the similar photocatalytic mechanisms, an excellent photocatalyst for CO2 reduction is usually also perform well for H2 generation especially for the situation in the presence of noble metal cocatalysts.Therefore, it is especially important to improve the selectivity for solar fuel generation as compared to H2 generation and other photochemical conversion.In addition to the overall photoactivity, fabrication cost and application prospect should also be considered during the development of CO2 photoreduction systems.In this regard, we think the present SrCO3/TiO2 HPJs should be a promising photocatalyst for CO2 photoreduction due to its low-cost cocatalyst, easy fabrication and relatively high photocatalytic performance. On the other hand, many researches have demonstrated that the surface engineering is a suitable way to face the above problem sine it can adjust the adsorbed behavior of CO2 and H2O on the catalyst surface. The present SrCO3/HPJs composite can improve the CO2/H2O adsorption ability and act as an efficient synergistic catalyst to promote the CH4 production, and thus cause a significantly enhanced activity and reduction with H2O.Therefore, we believe that applied SrCO3 can expand the concepts of synergetic catalysts towards high activity and selectivity beyond the metal or metal oxides as cocatalysts. On the bases of the above results and discussion, it can be concluded that there are at least three possible facts causing the significantly enhanced activity and selectivity of CO2 photoreduction to CH4 over the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs composite as compared the pristine TiO2.Firstly, the increasing surface area will increase the adsorptive sites of CO2 molecules, and finally results in the enhanced photoactivity for CO2 photoreduction; Secondly, the TiO2 heterophase junctions in the SrCO3/HPJs composites can promote the photogenerated charge separation due to the different energy band structures between brookite nanorods and anatase nanoparticles; Thirdly, suitable SrCO3 amount on the TiO2 HPJs can boost the interaction between the adsorbed CO2 molecules and the TiO2 HPJs surface to form HCO3 -and decrease the activation energy of CO2 under illumination, and thus promote the CH4 selectivity during the CO2 photoreduction processes.Namely, the synergistic effects of the brookite/anatase TiO2 HPJs and the SrCO3 species cause the significantly enhanced activity and selectivity for CO2 photoreduction to CH4 of the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs composite."}, {"llm generation": "Xenon", "source": "Fig. 5 depicts the average photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity of the pristine TiO2 and the SrCO3/HPJs composites under Xe-lamp irradiation for 2 h.", "context": "In summary, a series of SrCO3-modified TiO2-based composites have been synthesized through a one-pot hydrothermal method using TiCl4 as raw material.It is found that introducing Sr 2 ions into the -ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were acquired by using Miniflex 600 X-ray diffractometer with Cu K radiation ( 0.154 nm) at 40 kV and 15 mA.The scan rate was set as 4 min -1 from 10-50 with a step of 0.02.The morphology was investigated with Zeiss-Sigma field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM).The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) observation was conducted on a LaB6 JEM-2100 (HR) electron microscope (JEOL Ltd.) working at 200 kV.Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms at 77 K were measured on a Micrometrics ASAP 2010 system after the samples were degassed at 120 C.UV-Vis diffuse reflectance absorption spectra (DRS) were obtained by a Cary 5000 spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere with BaSO4 as the reference (Agilent Inc., U.S.).X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were recorded on an ESCALAB 250Xi X-ray photoelectron spectroscope (Thermo Fisher) equipped with a standard and monochromatic source (Al K, 1486.6 eV).Raman spectra were obtained by an RM-1000 Confocal Raman Microspectroscopy (Renishaw Co., Ltd) with an excitation wavelength of 514.5 nm.Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were obtained on a Hitachi F-4600 fluorimeter with an exciting wavelength of 290 nm.Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra were recorded at room temperature on Bruker EPR spectrometer operated at 9.419 GHz.The CO2 temperature programmed desorption (CO2-TPD) curves are obtained by using Micromeritics Autochem 2.

The FESEM images of the pristine TiO2 and the SrCO3/HPJs composites with different SrCO3-loading contents are shown in Fig. 2. The pristine TiO2 particles have a quasi nanocube-like morphology and a smooth surface with particle sizes in the range of 20-60 nm (Fig. 2a), which is similar to our previous observations 18,19.With adding 0.2 Sr 2 ions into the TiCl4 hydrothermal reaction solution, those nanocubes turn to short nanorod-like morphologies with slightly smaller width and some ultrafine nanoparticles attached on those nanorods' surfaces (Fig. 2b).Moreover, the number of ultrafine nanoparticles and the aspect ratio of nanorods increase along with enhancing the Sr 2 addition amount in the TiCl4 hydrothermal reaction solution (Fig. 2b-f). The TEM image (Fig. 3a from the FESEM image (Fig. 2d), in which those nanorods with 100 nm length and 20-30 nm width are surrounded by ultrafine nanoparticles with sizes smaller than 5 nm.The HRTEM image (Fig. 3d) and the corresponding Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) pattern (white solid pane in Fig. 3d) indicate that the single nanorod is also brookite TiO2, which is mainly shaped by the 210 exposed facets and grown along 001 orientation.After carefully checking those lattice fringes and FFT pattern (white dot pane in Fig. 3d) The survey XPS spectra (Fig. S2a) indicate that the pristine TiO2 exhibits Ti2p, O1s and C1s binding energy peaks and the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs composite has an additional weak Sr3d peak in addition to Ti2p, O1s and C1s peaks.The Ti2p regional high-resolution spectra (Fig. 4a) deliver two symmetrical peaks with binding energies of 458.5 and 464.4 eV in both pristine TiO2 and 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs, which correspond to Ti2p3/2 and Ti2p1/2 of Ti 4 37, respectively.There is no obvious shift and shoulder peak for the Ti2p regional spectrum of 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs, demonstrating that the chemical state of Ti element is simple and the Sr 2 ions may not dope into the TiO2 lattice at all.The O1s regional XPS spectra (Fig. 4b) show that the pristine TiO2 has a major peak with binding energy of 529.7 eV attributable to the O 2-ions in TiO2 lattice and a broad peak at 531.4 eV ascribable to the surface -OH group on TiO2 particles.The stronger -OH peak of 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs as compared to the pristine TiO2 implies the different surface states between the two products.The C1s XPS spectra (Fig. 4c) of both the pristine TiO2 and the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs can be deconvolved into three peaks at 289.0, 286.binding energy peaks at 134.5 and 132.8 eV 40.In addition, those Sr3d binding energy peaks of 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs composite disappeared after washed with diluted HNO3 solution (Fig. 4d).It indicates that the Sr species as SrCO3 only exist on the surfaces of TiO2 particles but not dope into TiO2 lattices.Similarly, the valence band XPS spectra (Fig. S2b) indicate that the pristine TiO2 and the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs composite have very similar valence bands, which also confirms the above conclusion that no Sr 2 -doping occurs during the present preparation process of the SrCO3/HPJs composites. The photocatalytic experiments demonstrate that CO/CH4 can be produced over those products in a gaseous CO2 photoreduction system containing H2O vapor under Xe-lamp irradiation, which is similar to our previous reports 181920.Control experiments show no reduced products of CO2 evolved without photocatalyst or CO2 gas, implying that those CO/CH4 reduced products are generated by the photocatalytic reaction processes.In addition, the main products in the present photoreaction systems are CO and CH4, and no other products such as CH3OH, C2H4 and C2H6 (using GC-FID method) or H2 (using GC-TCD ( where Vrea. is the volume of reactor; mcat. is the mass of the photocatalyst; tirr. is the irradiation time; cCO and cCH 4 are the produced CO and CH4 concentration, respectively.Of course, the H2, CH3OH and/or other reduced products (if any) should also be considered during the calculation of TCEN values.(Fig. 5a) with an overall photoactivity (TCEN) of 13.2 mol g -1 h -1 (Fig. 5b).Those SrCO3/HPJs composites, however, display obvious different photocatalytic activity and selectivity for the CH4/CO production.For example, the CH4 production activity of SrCO3/HPJs composites significantly increases from 0.79 to 19.66 mol g -1 h -1 along with enhancing the SrCO3-loading content from 0 to 1.0, while the CO production activity remains at a relatively low level with an unobvious change (Fig. 5a).It indicates that SrCO3/HPJs composites can achieve a much better activity and selectivity for CH4 production than that of pristine TiO2.Nevertheless, this increasing trend of photoactivity along with the SrCO3-loading content does not sustain when it is further increased from 4.0 to 10.Especially, the CH4/CO production activities (1.08/1.17mol g -1 h -1 ) and TCEN (11.9 mol g -1 h -1 ) of 10 SrCO3/HPJs composite are even lower than that of the pristine TiO2.It implies that excessive SrCO3 on TiO2 HPJs will be unfavorable for the CO2 photoreduction reactions.Consequently, the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs composite achieves CH4/CO production activities of 19.66/2.64mol g -1 h -1 with a maximum overall photoactivity (TCEN) of 162.6 mol g -1 h -1 , which is 12.3 times of the pristine TiO2 with a TCEN of 13.2 mol g -1 h -1 and CH4/CO production activities of 0.79/3.46mol g -1 h -1 .The CH4 production amount and the corresponding overall photoactivity (TCEN) for CO/CH4 production over the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs composite under a long term (10 h) irridiation are depicted in Fig. S3, which was conducted in a sealed gas-solid reactor connected to a GC with auto-injector, where the composition of the gas atmosphere was monitored with shorter intervals.As can be seen, the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs composite shows a continuous growth in the CH4 production amount in the initial 3 h, which then gradually gets smaller and stable in the following hours, while CO is mainly produced in the initial one hour, and gets slightly lower in the following hours, suggesting that CO is probably an intermediate product.Anyway, the continued growth trend of the CH4 production amount during the 10 h irridiation demonstrates that the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs composite has relatively good stability for the CO2 photoreduction. 14 Also, the photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity of the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs composite is influenced by the illumination intensity of Xe-lamp used, in which a silver reflector and UV coating are applied to adjust the exit light with wavelength longer than 330 nm, and the light with wavelength longer than 800 nm is cut by an infrared reflector to obtain a light spectrum shown in Fig. 6a.By varying the electric current, the illumination intensity can be adjusted, and a calibrated Si photodiode (SRC-1000-TC-QZ-N, Oriel) was used to measure the light intensity.As shown in Fig. 6b, a higher illumination intensity displays a better photoactivity for CO2 photoreduction, and the overall photoactivity (TCEN) is basically proportional to the light intensity when it is lower than 680 mW cm -2 .Among the two reduced products, the CO production rate reaches a platform at a relatively low illumination intensity (350 mW cm -2 ), while the CH4 production rate shows a growth trend along with the increase of the illumination intensity.Since the generation of one CH4 and CO molecule will consume 8 and 2 electrons, respectively, a low illumination intensity, which leads to a small amount of photogenerated electrons, is not beneficial for the CH4 generation.Under a high illumination intensity, the produced CO as an intermediate product can further react with the photogenerated electrons to form CH4, as a result, the CH4 production rate shows a growth trend along with the increase of the illumination intensity (Fig. 6b).Moreover, those CH4 production rate and TCEN curves dependent on the low light intensities can be extrapolated to the origin, which mean that there is no secondary reaction pathway other than photocatalysis in the present system. Since the UV-Vis diffuse reflectance absorption spectra (DRS, Fig. S4) indicate that the SrCO3 loading does not significantly affect the light absorption property of those composites, we started by determining their specific surface areas (SBET) by using liquid N2 adsorption-desorption experiments to explore the reasons of the significantly enhanced activity and selectivity of CO2 photoreduction to CH4.Although both the pristine TiO2 and the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs composite display typical type III isotherm with H3 hysteresis loop 18, the inflection of N2 adsorption branch of the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs composite starts at a relatively lower partial pressure than the pristine TiO2 (Fig. S5a).The corresponding Barret-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) pore size distribution plots determined from the desorption branches further reveal that the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs composite has a pore size distribution peak centered at 16.4 nm (Fig. S5b), much smaller than that (26.6 nm) of the pristine TiO2.As a result, the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs composite delivers a much larger SBET (106 m 2 g -1 ) than the pristine TiO2 (28.8 m 2 g -1 ).The much smaller pore size and larger surface area of the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs composite as compared to the pristine TiO2 can be due to the formation of ultrafine anatase nanoparticles and the aspect ratio changes of the brookite nanocubes after adding Sr 2 ions into the reaction solution as mentioned above.Nevertheless, the TCEN (1.53 mol m -2 h -1 ) per unit area of 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs composite is still 3.32 times of the pristine TiO2 (0.46 mol g -1 h -1 ) (Fig. 5b).It means that the increased SBET of the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs composite is not the only cause of the enhanced CO2 photoreduction activity as compared to the pristine TiO2. It has been reported that the anatase/rutile TiO2 HPJs can effectively improve the photoactivity mainly caused by the increase in photogenerated charge separation efficiency 41,42.In the present SrCO3/HPJs composite containing brookite and anatase, the enhanced CO2 photoreduction activity might be also ascribable to the TiO2 HPJs formed at the brookite/anatase interfaces since they also have different energy band structures 14,15.As mentioned above, the number of ultrafine anatase nanoparticles increases along with enhancing the Sr 2 addition amount in the TiCl4 reaction solution.Correspondingly, the increasing trend of photoactivity along with enhancing the SrCO3-loading content to 1.0 (Fig. 5) can be mainly due to the more interface HPJs formed among those brookite and anatase, while the decreased activity of the 4.0 SrCO3/HPJs composite implies that there is an optimal proportion among those brookite, anatase and SrCO3 phases. To further confirm this issue, the 1.0 BaCO3/HPJs composite was also synthesized through a similar method by using BaCl2 instead of SrCl2 not only because its SBET (161 m 2 g -1 ) is much larger than that (106 m 2 g -1 ) of the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs (Fig. S5a), but also because its relative content of the anatase nanoparticles is much higher than that of the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs as shown in Fig. S6 and3c).The XRD patterns (Fig. S7a) and Raman spectra (Fig. S7b) also demonstrate that the 1.0 BaCO3/HPJs composite is a brookite/anatase mixed phase but with much higher relative content of anatase nanoparticles as compared to the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs.These results demonstrate that Ba 2 ions instead of Sr 2 ions adding into the TiCl4 hydrothermal reaction solution would be more beneficial for the formation of anatase nanoparticles, which further lead to the higher surface area.Although the 1.0 BaCO3/HPJs composite exhibits better CO/CH4 production activities (6.55/15.78mol g -1 h -1 ) and TCEN (139.3 mol g -1 h -1 ) than the pristine TiO2 once again, but they are still lower than that of the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs composite (Fig. 5) even though it has a 16 much higher SBET than the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs.It implies that the larger surface area and higher anatase relative content of 1.0 BaCO3/HPJs do not contribute a better photoactivity than the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs. The above results reveal that the TiO2 HPJs formed at the anatase/brookite interfaces with an optimal proportion would be of importance for promoting the photogenerated charge separation efficiency and then the better activity of the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs.This assumption on the charge separation can be validated by the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the pristine TiO2 and SrCO3/HPJs composites shown in Fig. 7a.As seen, those emission peaks in the range of 350-550 nm can be attributed to the bandgap excitation of TiO2, and significant PL quenching can be observed from those SrCO3/HPJs composites.It was reported that the valence band (CB) of brookite TiO2 is higher than that of anatase TiO2, (-0.96 vs. -0.91 eV) 10.Probably, the higher photoactivity is mainly caused by the increase in photogenerated charge separation efficiency resulting from interfacial electron transfer from brookite to anatase, and thus resulting in a suppression of the direct photoexcited charge recombination 41424344. To make clear the role of the SrCO3 in those SrCO3/HPJs composites, the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs composite was washed by diluted HNO3 solution followed by washing with distilled H2O several times to completely remove the SrCO3 on the TiO2 surfaces.As shown in Fig. 4d, the washed 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs composite has no obvious Sr3d binding energy peaks, indicating SrCO3 can be completely removed, and the remained matter should be single brookite/anatase TiO2 HPJs.Although the washed 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs composite shows an obviously decreased activity as compared to the unwashed one (Fig. S8), it still delivers much better activity than the pristine TiO2.Since a significant PL quenching can be observed for washed product as compared to the pristine TiO2 (Fig. 7a), it can be concluded that its better activity is also mainly caused by the TiO2 HPJs through promoting the photogenerated charge separation at the brookite/anatase interfaces 41424344.After reloading with 1.0 SrCO3, the washed product delivers an enhanced CO2 reduction activity but still lower than the original one (Fig. S8).However, those 1.0SrCO3 or Sr(NO3)2 loaded pristine TiO2 only show very limited enhancement in the activity.These results demonstrate that only the larger specific surface area or the TiO2 heterophase junction effect may not lead to such a preferable result of the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs composite, and the synergistic effects of the TiO2 HPJs and SrCO3 species cause the significantly enhanced activity and selectivity for CO2 photoreduction to CH4. The CO2 temperature-programmed desorption (CO2-TPD) curves (Fig. 7b), from which the adsorption amount and strength of catalysts can be surveyed, indicate that the pristine TiO2 mainly exhibits three CO2 desorption peaks.The TPD peak in the temperature range of 60-120 oC may be related to the CO2 desorption from the physical adsorption sites on the brookite TiO2, the TPD peak in the range of 180-340 oC may be attributable to the CO2 desorption from weak adsorbed bicarbonates, and the broad peak beyond 350 oC may stem from to the decomposition of the strongly adsorbed carbonates on the brookite TiO2 454647.Those SrCO3/HPJs composites display much stronger TPD peak signals at the low temperature region than the pristine TiO2, indicating that the physically adsorbed CO2 amount on those SrCO3/HPJs composites are much higher than that on the pristine TiO2, which is probably due to the higher specific surface area of those SrCO3/HPJs composites.Moreover, the SrCO3/HPJs composites with low SrCO3-loading contents (0.4 and 1.0) display a dramatically increased TPD peak in a higher temperature region (210-380 oC) as compared to the pristine TiO2 (180-340 oC), implying that the chemical combination of the adsorbed CO2 molecules on those SrCO3/HPJs composites are stronger and more substantial.Also, the additional TPD peak in the range of 380-530 oC for those SrCO3/HPJs composites may result from different combination modes of CO2 on the TiO2 HPJs.Since the washed SrCO3/HPJs composite has no any TPD signal at the two temperature regions (Fig. 7b), it can be concluded that the co-existence of SrCO3 species may promote the CO2 adsorption on the TiO2 HPJs.However, excessive SrCO3 loading (10) causes those TPD peaks in the ranges of 210-380 oC and 380-530 oC shifting to lower temperature regions, which may be ascribed to the excessive SrCO3 occupying those adsorption sites of the A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T 18 TiO2 HPJs.The above results demonstrate that the SrCO3 species with suitable content would significantly enhance the CO2 adsorption on the TiO2 HPJs, and the stronger combination between CO2 molecules and TiO2 HPJs may be a benefit to the activation of CO2 and then to the enhanced photoactivity. The in situ DRIFTS IR spectra (Fig. 8) reveal the different CO2/H2O adsorption behaviors existing among the pristine TiO2 and the SrCO3/HPJs composites with/without light irradiation.Before irradiation, the pristine TiO2 exhibits strong bands in the ranges of 3715-3753 cm -1 and 3670-3715 cm -1 (Fig. 8a), which can be attributed to the IR absorbance of -OH groups on the surface Ti 3 and Ti 4 sites 19,20,48,49, respectively.However, the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs composite displays a much lower IR absorbance (3670-3715 cm -1 ) of Ti 4 -OH than the pristine TiO2, which becomes stronger again for the 10 SrCO3/HPJs and the washed 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs.Therefore, it can be conjectured that the CO2 molecules may principally occupied the Ti 4 sites and a small amount of SrCO3 loading may help this process, while excessive SrCO3 cannot cause this effect possibly due to the surface Ti 4 sites occupied by SrCO3 species.This assumption on the excessive SrCO3 retards the surface CO2 adsorption on the TiO2 HPJs can be confirmed by the DRIFTS IR spectra in the range of 2000-1200 cm -1 (Fig. 8b).The pristine TiO2 surfaces are dominated by strongly adsorbed H2O at 1635 cm -1 , bidentate carbonates (b-CO3 2-) at 1579 and 1334 cm -1 , and weak monodentate carbonates (m-CO3 2-) at 1518 and 1395 cm -1 45,484950.After modified with SrCO3, the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs composite displays shoulder IR peaks at 1673 and 1249 cm -1 , which can be assigned to the Ti-CO2 -species 50.Once again, the higher SrCO3-loading content (10) does not hold these IR absorption results.Probably, excessive SrCO3 would retard the formation of CO2 -species on the TiO2 BHJs. The formation of Ti-CO2 -indicates that the electrons could be spontaneously attached to CO2 from the defective TiO2 even in the dark, which is consistent with the previous result 50.Moreover, the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs composite displays a new peak at 1475 cm -1 and an unobvious shoulder at 1690 cm -1 , ascribable to the HCO3 -species, which are generated by CO2 -interaction with surface OH groups 48,50. It is consistent with the observation that the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs displays a much lower IR absorbance (3670-3715 cm -1 ) of Ti 4 -OH than the pristine TiO2 and demonstrates that CO2 molecules tends to combine with surface OH groups to form HCO3 -species on the TiO2 BHJs.After light irradiation for 30 min, the IR bands in the range of 3670-3753 cm -1 keep a changing trend similar to that of those samples in the dark (Fig. 8a andc), illustrating that the surface OH adsorption is not significantly affected by irradiation.However, the pristine TiO2 after illumination exhibits obviously increased m-CO3 2-at 1395 cm -1 and b-CO3 2-at 1334 cm -1 (Fig. 8d), which usually leads to a tendency of CO production during the CO2 photoreduction 19,20,484950.It is consistent with the above result that the pristine TiO2 produces CO as the major product (Fig. 5a).By contrast, the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs after irradiation exhibits much lower IR peaks of m-CO3 2-at 1395 cm -1 and b-CO3 2-at 1334 cm -1 but with evident peaks at 1690 and 1475 cm -1 appeared, which may be attributed to the HCO3 -species 48,50, illustrating that the HCO3 -is the main species for the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs under illumination.As a result, the CH4 selectivity during the CO2 photoreduction processes is enhanced as shown in Fig 5 .Moreover, the shoulder peaks at 1716 cm -1 can be assigned to HCOOH 48,50, which may be one of the intermediates occurred under illumination.The above results suggest that HCO3 -and HCOOH are possibly the major Generally, the photocatalytic performance and product kinds for CO2 reduction strongly depend on the photocatalyst and its experimental conditions, and the overall photoactivity of various CO2 photoreaction systems only can be compared using the above-mentioned TCEN values, which can be calculated using equation ( 1) according to the corresponding products.Since there are extraordinary variety of photocatalysts and their photoreaction systems for CO2 reduction as mentioned in our previous literatures 2,3, herein, our result was just compared with some recently reported results on TiO2 or TiO2-based photocatalysts as shown in Table S1.As seen, the current SrCO3/HPJs composite shows a relatively higher overall photoactivity (TCEN) compared to most of the results reported in those recent literatures.Metals (including noble metals or transition metals) and/or their oxidized species have been widely used as cocatalysts for the CO2 photoreduction.Usually, these cocatalysts with Fermi levels below the CB bottom of TiO2 can form Schottky barrier at TiO2/cocatalyst interface, and thus promote the photogenerated charge separation and then the multielectron reaction process of CO2 photoreduction.Nevertheless, it is not the best way for the selectivity of CO2 photoreduction reactions because of the competition reaction of H2 generation, especially for those noble metal-based cocatalysts as shown in Table S1.Owing to the similar photocatalytic mechanisms, an excellent photocatalyst for CO2 reduction is usually also perform well for H2 generation especially for the situation in the presence of noble metal cocatalysts.Therefore, it is especially important to improve the selectivity for solar fuel generation as compared to H2 generation and other photochemical conversion.In addition to the overall photoactivity, fabrication cost and application prospect should also be considered during the development of CO2 photoreduction systems.In this regard, we think the present SrCO3/TiO2 HPJs should be a promising photocatalyst for CO2 photoreduction due to its low-cost cocatalyst, easy fabrication and relatively high photocatalytic performance. On the other hand, many researches have demonstrated that the surface engineering is a suitable way to face the above problem sine it can adjust the adsorbed behavior of CO2 and H2O on the catalyst surface. The present SrCO3/HPJs composite can improve the CO2/H2O adsorption ability and act as an efficient synergistic catalyst to promote the CH4 production, and thus cause a significantly enhanced activity and reduction with H2O.Therefore, we believe that applied SrCO3 can expand the concepts of synergetic catalysts towards high activity and selectivity beyond the metal or metal oxides as cocatalysts. On the bases of the above results and discussion, it can be concluded that there are at least three possible facts causing the significantly enhanced activity and selectivity of CO2 photoreduction to CH4 over the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs composite as compared the pristine TiO2.Firstly, the increasing surface area will increase the adsorptive sites of CO2 molecules, and finally results in the enhanced photoactivity for CO2 photoreduction; Secondly, the TiO2 heterophase junctions in the SrCO3/HPJs composites can promote the photogenerated charge separation due to the different energy band structures between brookite nanorods and anatase nanoparticles; Thirdly, suitable SrCO3 amount on the TiO2 HPJs can boost the interaction between the adsorbed CO2 molecules and the TiO2 HPJs surface to form HCO3 -and decrease the activation energy of CO2 under illumination, and thus promote the CH4 selectivity during the CO2 photoreduction processes.Namely, the synergistic effects of the brookite/anatase TiO2 HPJs and the SrCO3 species cause the significantly enhanced activity and selectivity for CO2 photoreduction to CH4 of the 1.0 SrCO3/HPJs composite."}]}}
