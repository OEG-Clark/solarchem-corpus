O particles were measured from the photocurrent response under solar light irradiation at an applied potential of 0.7 V vs. SCE.", "context": "3.1.Physical properties of the synthesized BFZnO and BFZn 1-x Mg x O core-shell particles Fig. 2 presents the XRD patterns and SEM images of the BF, BFZnO and BFZn 1-x Mg x O particles.In Fig. 2A, the BF did not show any peaks assigned to the metal oxide and it appeared to be amorphous.The XRD peaks in BFZnO were assigned to a hexagonal ZnO crystal phase with P63mc space group 17.The peaks 112) and (201) planes, respectively.In the case of the BFZn 1-x Mg x O particles, no MgO peaks were observed and the 2-theta positions of the XRD peaks were almost the same as those of the BFZnO particles except in the case of Zn 0.75 Mg 0.25 O.The presence of well-defined XRD peaks for ZnO and Zn 1-x Mg x O indicates the excellent degree of ordering of the coreshell struc-ture between the BF and nanoparticles.In general, the interface between the core and shell can be tailored to passivate the relaxation pathways and form radiative states.Therefore, the coreshell structure has found many applications in the field of photocatalysis.On the other hand, the peaks were broader and smaller with Zn 1-x Mg x O than with ZnO, which means that Zn 1-x Mg x O has a smaller crystallite size than ZnO.The mean crystallite sizes were determined using the (101) peaks according to the Scherrer formula 18.The crystallite size values calculated for ZnO, Zn 0.80 Mg 0.2 O, Zn 0.75 Mg 0.25 O, Zn 0.67 Mg 0.33 O, and Zn 0.50 Mg 0.50 O grown on the BF surface were 29.33, 26.55, 27.09, 38.01, and 42.21 nm, respectively.Therefore, we confirmed that the crystal size decreased with increasing amount of added Mg up to 25, but increased thereafter.In the SEM images of Fig. 2B, the pure ZnO particles exhibited a hexagonal shape, while a mixture of cubic and hexagonal shapes was observed in the case of the Zn 1-x Mg x O particles having sizes of about 100 nm.However, the pure MgO has a shape like that of a thin cloth.In Fig. 2C, the BF had a diameter of 15 m and its surface was smooth.The BFnanoparticle core-shell particles were fabricated by growing the ZnO and Zn 1-x Mg x O nanoparticles.A regular array between the ZnO and Zn 1-x Mg x O nanoparticles was clearly observed in the shells of all of the samples, which indicates the good ordering of the core-shell structure.The nanoparticles, ZnO and Zn 1-x Mg x O, covered the BF surface completely.The grown parts consisted of uniform and fine spherical particles with sizes of about 100 nm which were well-dispersed, and the shells all had flower blossom shapes.On the other hand, as the amount of magnesium added was increased, the sheet shapes which connected them in the form of a net grew in size.This part can probably be regarded as a composite of ZnMgO and its amount was greatly increased in the Zn 0.75 Mg 0.25 O particles.In the case where more Mg was added, a lot of thin particles were linked together, giving them the appearance of a cotton wad. The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDAX) results and SEM elemental mapping images confirmed the presence of metals on the surfaces of the BFZnO and BFZn 1-x Mg x O particles, as shown in Figs. 3 and4 respectively, and Table 1 lists the atomic compositions determined by EDAX.The EDAX peaks in Fig. 3 confirmed that the basalt fiber contains various metal oxides, such as those of Na, K, Ca, Mg, Al, Si, Fe, and Ti.The pure BF presented in Table 1 exhibited a composition of 15.8 atomic Si, 6.2 total alkali metals, 0.59 Ti, 2.59 Fe, and 4.44 Al.The contents of Ca and Mg, which can act as a CO 2 adsorbent, were 2.34 and 1.89 atomic, respectively, and there was no Zn element.The synthesized BFZnO particles contained 15.55 atomic Zn and the amounts of the other elements were slightly reduced.In the Zn 1-x Mg x O particles, the concentration of Zn actually present generally increased with increasing amount of Mg added in the synthesis step.The values did not appear to be perfectly quantitative, however, because of the fact that EDAX is only a surface analytical method and, therefore, the relative concentrations of the components may vary depending on the position of the surface, especially when the sample is nonuniform.On the basis of the Zn and Mg elemental mapping images for BFZnO and BFZn 0.75 Mg 0.25 O in Fig. 4, it was confirmed that all of the elements are uniformly dispersed on the surface of the basalt fiber. Fig. 5A and B shows the diffuse reflectance UV-vis absorption spectra and PL spectra of the BFZnO and BFZn 1-x Mg x O particles, respectively.First, in Fig. 5A, the pure BF absorbed wavelengths over a wide range due to the presence of transition metals, such as Ti and Fe.After growing the ZnO and Zn 1-x Mg x O nanoparticles, the main absorption peaks became clearer: the BFZnO core-shell structured sample had maximum bands located in the region of 300-400 nm, suggesting the formation of polymerized Zn O Zn species at higher coordination numbers assigned to the hexagonal ZnO structure 19.This band slightly shifted to a higher wavelength in BF Zn 1-x Mg x O compared to that of BFZnO, except for the BFZn 0.5 Mg 0.5 O particles.On the other hand, the absorption spectra had a steeper absorption edge, which was similar to the results obtained from Tauc's equation 20.The band gaps of pure BF, BFZnO, BFZn 0.80 Mg 0.2 O, BFZn 0.75 Mg 0.25 O, BFZn 0.67 Mg 0.33 O, and BFZn 0.50 Mg 0.50 O were estimated using Tauc's equation to be 1.58, 3.11, 3.07, 3.09, 3.10, and 3.15 eV, respectively.Generally, a lower band gap is better for enhancing the photocatalytic performance under weak solar radiation, but this principle does not always hold true, because of the band gap available to facilitate recombination between the electrons and holes being smaller 21.Reducing the recombination between the electrons and holes by doping the semiconductor structure with impurity atoms makes it possible to introduce some carrier trapping or oxygen vacancy defects into it.Recently, the chemistry of structurally defective semiconductors by metal doping (or oxygen vacancies) has been reported, and these materials, despite their having a huge band-gap, could be tuned appropriately by doping them for photocatalytic applications 22.Fig. 5B presents the PL spectra of the prepared BFZnO and BFZn 1-x Mg x O particles.The PL curve suggests that the electrons in the valence band are transferred to the conduction band and stabilized by photoemission.In general, increasing the level of recombination between the excited electrons and holes results in a decrease in the photoactivity 23.However, sometimes the PL intensity is observed to decrease significantly when a metal captures excited electrons or exhibits conductivity; a mechanism which is known as the relaxation process.All of the particles exhibited PL signals with a similar curve shape, demonstrating the presence of ZnO.The BFZnO exhibited a strong PL signal in the range of 400-550 nm, with a maximum excitation wavelength of 469 nm, whereas the BFZn 0.75 Mg 0.25 O curve intensities were weakened dramatically.However, when the atomic concentration of Mg added reaches 0.25 mol, the PL intensity becomes stronger, because the Mg atoms act as recombination centers.A decreasing tendency of the PL emission was observed in the fol- The efficiencies of the process of photogenerated electron-hole production in the BF, BFZnO, BFZn 0.75 Mg 0.25 O particles were measured from the photocurrent response under solar light irradiation at an applied potential of 0.7 V vs. SCE.Fig. 6 shows the typical real time photocurrent response of the films when the light source is switched on and off, exhibiting a rapid rise and decay.When the light was turned on, a rapid increase in the photoreduction current was observed, which stabilized at a steady state after a few seconds.When the light was turned off, the photocurrent decreased instantaneously to almost zero.When the light was turned on, the maximum photocurrents obtained for BFZnO and BFZn 0.75 Mg 0.25 O were 70.23 and 96.01 mA cm -2 , respectively, which were higher than that achieved on pure BF (30.50 mA cm -2 ).Therefore, it can be concluded that the Mg ingredient has a beneficial effect on the photocurrent by playing the role of an intermediate, facilitating the efficient separation of the photogenerated hole-electron pairs.3.2.Gas adsorption abilities and CO 2 photoreduction over the BFZnO and BFZn 1-x Mg x O core-shell particles For CO 2 photoreduction, CO 2 gases are adsorbed onto the surface of the photocatalysts in the first step and then the photoreduction reaction progresses.Therefore, the photocatalytic performance depends on the adsorption capacity of CO 2 gas.Fig. 7 shows the CO 2 desorption profiles (CO 2 -TPD) of the core-shell structured BFZnO and BFZn 1-x Mg x O particles obtained at high temperatures (800 C).The curve intensity for CO 2 desorption was very small in the case of pure BF, however it was about 3 times higher in the case of BFZnO and much higher in the case of the Fig. 5. Diffuse reflectance-UV-vis absorption spectra (A) and PL curves (B) of the BFZnO and BFZn1-xMgxO particles.Fig. 6.Photocurrent density curves of the BF, BFZnO, and BFZn0.75Mg0.25Oparticles.Fig. 7. CO2-TPD curves corresponding to CO2 desorption over the BFZnO and BFZn1-xMgxO particles. BFZn 1-x Mg x O particles, which means that considerably more CO 2 molecules were adsorbed on the BFZn 1-x Mg x O surface than on the BFZnO one.The highest level of adsorption was observed on the BFZn 0.75 Mg 0.25 O particles.In general, a rapid catalytic reaction occurs when many reactants are well-adsorbed over the catalyst.The presence of Mg and Zn most likely causes a relative increase in the number of CO 2 molecules adsorbed.Consequently, this synergy contributes significantly to improving the catalytic performance of the BFZn 1-x Mg x O particles. Fig. 8 presents the photoreduction abilities of BFZnO and BFZn 1-x Mg x O for CO 2 with H 2 O vapor.Generally, the reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O can be divided into the following three sub-processes 24: proton production resulting from H 2 O photodecomposition, CO radical production due to CO 2 photo cleavage and hydrocarbon production derived from photosynthesis between the CO radical and proton.The photogenerated electrons on the photocatalysts caused by UV-radiation induce CO 2 reduction to produce CO 2 radicals, whereas the holes react with the adsorbed H 2 O molecules to perform oxidation.The intermediate photogenerated species undergo different reactions to produce CO or CH 4 .The production of CH 4 from methyl radicals ( CH 3 ) has previously been confirmed, and the formation of the intermediate product, CO, is directly dependent on these radicals 25.As shown in this figure, unlike the TiO 2 catalyst in our previous studies 26,27, the major product was the CO molecule in the case of the BFZnO-based catalysts, and the amount of CH 4 produced in the case of BFZnO was sufficiently small, 0.065 molg cat -1 L -1 , to be ignored.This seems to be due to the presence of ZnO: typically, ZnO is known to be a useful catalyst in the water gas shift or reverse water gas shift reactions, thus making it easier for the reaction to progress to CO than to CH 4 .Consequently, we discovered that by using a Zn-based catalyst, CO can be selectively generated from carbon dioxide.The BFZn 0.80 Mg 0.2 O and BFZn 0.75 Mg 0.25 O catalysts showed higher photoactivity for CO 2 photoreduction than the BFZnO; 5.2 molg cat -1 L -1 of CO was produced over BFZn 0.75 Mg 0.25 O, suggesting that it contained 25 atomic of Mg.This difference in yield was attributed to the different band gaps and gas adsorption abilities of the BFZnO and BFZn 1-x Mg x O particles.However, the amount of CO 2 reduction on the catalysts, to which more than 25 of Mg was added, was greatly decreased.Scheme 2 presents a model for CO 2 photoreduction over the BFZn 1-x Mg x O particles based on the relationship between the optical properties of the photocatalysts and their catalytic activities.The possible reaction pathway of CO 2 photoreduction to CO, CH 4 and the other products are expressed in Eqs. ( 1)-( 7) 282930. CO 2 e - CO - 2 (4) CO - 2 H e - CO OH - CO e - CO -H e - C OH - C H e - CH Photon excitation over Zn 1-x Mg x O will begin rapidly because Zn 1-x Mg x O has a shorter band-gap than pure ZnO, and the excited electrons can be transferred efficiently to the CO 2 molecules.In The addition of Mg to ZnO can promote the separation of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs (e -/h ) over Zn 1-x Mg x O. Therefore, the synergistic effects of the BF core and Mg incorporated ZnO shell in the BF Zn 1-x Mg x O particles result in the achievement of a higher CO 2 reduction efficiency for CO production."}, {"llm generation": "UV", "source": "The photogenerated electrons on the photocatalysts caused by UV-radiation induce CO 2 reduction to produce CO 2 radicals, whereas the holes react with the adsorbed H 2 O molecules to perform oxidation.", "context": "3.1.Physical properties of the synthesized BFZnO and BFZn 1-x Mg x O core-shell particles Fig. 2 presents the XRD patterns and SEM images of the BF, BFZnO and BFZn 1-x Mg x O particles.In Fig. 2A, the BF did not show any peaks assigned to the metal oxide and it appeared to be amorphous.The XRD peaks in BFZnO were assigned to a hexagonal ZnO crystal phase with P63mc space group 17.The peaks 112) and (201) planes, respectively.In the case of the BFZn 1-x Mg x O particles, no MgO peaks were observed and the 2-theta positions of the XRD peaks were almost the same as those of the BFZnO particles except in the case of Zn 0.75 Mg 0.25 O.The presence of well-defined XRD peaks for ZnO and Zn 1-x Mg x O indicates the excellent degree of ordering of the coreshell struc-ture between the BF and nanoparticles.In general, the interface between the core and shell can be tailored to passivate the relaxation pathways and form radiative states.Therefore, the coreshell structure has found many applications in the field of photocatalysis.On the other hand, the peaks were broader and smaller with Zn 1-x Mg x O than with ZnO, which means that Zn 1-x Mg x O has a smaller crystallite size than ZnO.The mean crystallite sizes were determined using the (101) peaks according to the Scherrer formula 18.The crystallite size values calculated for ZnO, Zn 0.80 Mg 0.2 O, Zn 0.75 Mg 0.25 O, Zn 0.67 Mg 0.33 O, and Zn 0.50 Mg 0.50 O grown on the BF surface were 29.33, 26.55, 27.09, 38.01, and 42.21 nm, respectively.Therefore, we confirmed that the crystal size decreased with increasing amount of added Mg up to 25, but increased thereafter.In the SEM images of Fig. 2B, the pure ZnO particles exhibited a hexagonal shape, while a mixture of cubic and hexagonal shapes was observed in the case of the Zn 1-x Mg x O particles having sizes of about 100 nm.However, the pure MgO has a shape like that of a thin cloth.In Fig. 2C, the BF had a diameter of 15 m and its surface was smooth.The BFnanoparticle core-shell particles were fabricated by growing the ZnO and Zn 1-x Mg x O nanoparticles.A regular array between the ZnO and Zn 1-x Mg x O nanoparticles was clearly observed in the shells of all of the samples, which indicates the good ordering of the core-shell structure.The nanoparticles, ZnO and Zn 1-x Mg x O, covered the BF surface completely.The grown parts consisted of uniform and fine spherical particles with sizes of about 100 nm which were well-dispersed, and the shells all had flower blossom shapes.On the other hand, as the amount of magnesium added was increased, the sheet shapes which connected them in the form of a net grew in size.This part can probably be regarded as a composite of ZnMgO and its amount was greatly increased in the Zn 0.75 Mg 0.25 O particles.In the case where more Mg was added, a lot of thin particles were linked together, giving them the appearance of a cotton wad. The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDAX) results and SEM elemental mapping images confirmed the presence of metals on the surfaces of the BFZnO and BFZn 1-x Mg x O particles, as shown in Figs. 3 and4 respectively, and Table 1 lists the atomic compositions determined by EDAX.The EDAX peaks in Fig. 3 confirmed that the basalt fiber contains various metal oxides, such as those of Na, K, Ca, Mg, Al, Si, Fe, and Ti.The pure BF presented in Table 1 exhibited a composition of 15.8 atomic Si, 6.2 total alkali metals, 0.59 Ti, 2.59 Fe, and 4.44 Al.The contents of Ca and Mg, which can act as a CO 2 adsorbent, were 2.34 and 1.89 atomic, respectively, and there was no Zn element.The synthesized BFZnO particles contained 15.55 atomic Zn and the amounts of the other elements were slightly reduced.In the Zn 1-x Mg x O particles, the concentration of Zn actually present generally increased with increasing amount of Mg added in the synthesis step.The values did not appear to be perfectly quantitative, however, because of the fact that EDAX is only a surface analytical method and, therefore, the relative concentrations of the components may vary depending on the position of the surface, especially when the sample is nonuniform.On the basis of the Zn and Mg elemental mapping images for BFZnO and BFZn 0.75 Mg 0.25 O in Fig. 4, it was confirmed that all of the elements are uniformly dispersed on the surface of the basalt fiber.
