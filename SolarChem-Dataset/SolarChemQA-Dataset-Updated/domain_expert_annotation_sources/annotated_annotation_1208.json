The morphologies of photocatalysts were captured by a HITACHI JEOL-2100F transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and more details were further obtained by higher magnification transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) at 200 kV accelerating voltage.The structure and crystalline size were detected by an X-ray diffractometer (Bruker D8-Focus, Cu-K, 0.15418 nm, 40 kV, 200 mA).The patterns were examined in the 2 range of 10-90 and scanning rate was 10/min.Thermogravimetric analysis was operated under air atmosphere at 5 C/min in the range of room temperature to 900 C.Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms were measured using an American Quantachrome Autosorb analyzer at -196 C.Prior to the analysis, all of the samples were vacuumed at 200 C for 6 h.The surface area and pore volume were calculated using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method.The valence states of elements were obtained by an X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).The oxygen vacancies were determined by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR) with a Brook a300. UV-vis diffuse spectra (DRS) were characterized by an UV-vis spectrometer (PerkinElmer, Lambda 750) to judge the visible light absorption capacity of the photocatalysts.The scanning range was 200-800 nm and BaSO 4 was used as the background.Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were tested via a Fluorolog three photoluminescence spectrometer (Horiba Jobin Yvon, Japan).The excitation wavelength was 280 nm, the scanning wavelength range was 300-750 nm, and the slit width was 1 nm.Photoelectrochemical measurements were performed using an electrochemical workstation (CHI-650E, Chenhua Company, Shanghai, China) with a three-electrode system.The test was conducted at room temperature using 0.1 mol/L Na 2 SO 4 as electrolyte solution.The as-prepared samples electrodes on the ITO glass were served as the working electrode.The Ag/AgCl electrode acted as the reference electrode and platinum sheet worked as the counter electrode, respectively. The CO 2 chemical adsorption ability of as-prepared samples was evaluated by temperature programmed desorption (TPD-CO 2 ).0.3 g catalyst samples were filled in a quartz tube and purged with nitrogen at 773 K for 2 h.After the reactor was cooled to a specific temperature, the CO 2 was introduced in the way of pulse to achieve a saturation chemisorption.Following, the samples was purged with He gas to the equilibrium, and the temperature was increased to 500 C at the rate of 5 C/min.The desorbed products were measured by TCD detector. The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction experiment was carried out in a homemade stainless vessel reactor with H 2 O vapor under visible light irradiation ( 420 nm).Before the catalytic reaction, and the trace impurities in CO 2 (CO and O 2 ) was removed by Cu and CuO at 650 C.50 mg catalyst powder was evenly dispersed in the reactor tray.Prior to light irradiation, the reactor was rinsed with CO 2 (30 mL/min) for 1 h at 160 C to remove the air in the reactor and the organic substances adsorbed on the catalyst surface.Then, all the valves of the reactor were closed to form a sealed system.0.3 mL deionized water was injected into reactor.Subsequently, the 300 W xenon lamp (PLS-SXE 300C xenon lamp) equipped with a 420 nm cutoff filter was used as the simulated light source.After irradiated at 160 C for 2 h, the products were analyzed by an on-line gas chromatography using a thermal conductivity detector (Agilent 4890, nitrogen as carrier gas)."}, {"llm generation": "photocatalysts (Mg-Fe-T samples)", "source": "Since the chemisorption and activation of CO 2 on the surface of photocatalysts is directly related to the activity of photocatalyst, TPD and in-situ FTIR for CO 2 chemisorption were carried out to investigate the effects of calcination temperature on the absorption properties of CO 2 on the surface of Mg-Fe-T samples.", "context": "The XRD patterns of Mg-Fe-T samples were shown in Fig. 1.It can be seen clearly that all samples display the diffraction peaks at 2 30.2,35.5, 43.2, 53.6, 57.1 and 62.7, corresponded to (220), (311), (400), ( 422), ( 511) and (440) crystal plane of cubic MgFe 2 O 4 (JCPDS 36-0398) 34, respectively, which indicates the formation of MgFe 2 O 4 spinel phase.However, the characteristic peaks of hematite Fe 2 O 3 at the 2 33.1,40.8, 49.5 and 64.0 were detected (JCPDS 33-0664) when calcination temperature is much lower than 750 C and these peaks disappeared with the further increase of the temperature.In addition, the intensity of XRD diffraction peaks ascribed to spinel phase was getting more intense and sharper as the calcination temperature increased from 650 to 800 C, indicating that the crystallinity or particle size of MgFe 2 O 4 spinel phase increased with the increase of temperature.However, when calcination temperature reached 850 C, the XRD peak became weak compared to that of Mg-Fe-850 sample, revealing a slight destroy of spinel phase at higher temperature.The crystal size of each sample was estimated by Debye-Scherrer's formula according to their (311) planes, which are subsequently 38.1 nm, 42.7 nm, 45.6 nm, 48.5 nm and 50.3 nm, respectively, showing that the particle sizes increased gradually with the increase of temperature due to the crystal growth. FTIR spectra of MgFe 2 O 4 ferrite prepared at different calcinated temperature were shown in Fig. 1(b).For precursor, a weak peak around 1385 cm -1 was assigned to the vibration of nitrate 35, which may be due to the presence of residual inorganic salts in the samples.No characteristic peak of spinel was found in the precursor, indicating the spinel structure was formed after calcination.In Mg-Fe-T samples, the characteristic bands at 430 cm -1 and 551 cm -1 attributed to the stretching vibration of metal-oxygen bond at octahedral and tetrahedron, and the high frequency bands around 1000 cm -1 ascribed to stretching intrinsic vibration of unit cell of spinel in tetrahedral sites 36 were observed, confirming the formation of cubic spinel structure 37.As the calcination temperature raised, the FTIR bands became strong, and then weakened when temperature is high than 800 C, which was consistence with XRD patterns. The morphology of the samples was analyzed in detail using the TEM images.As shown in Fig. 2, all MgFe 2 O 4 samples prepared by coprecipitation exhibited particle morphology, and some particles aggregated into layer due to the magnetic force of ferrite 23.With the increase of calcination temperature, the morphology of the samples was transformed gradually to cube structure, and the particle sizes of Mg-Fe-T have a slight increase with the increase of calcination temperature.The lattice fringes with the lattice spacing about 0.26 nm, contributed to the (311) crystal facet of cubic MgFe 2 O 4 , was clearly observed from the HR-TEM images (h), which verified the successful synthesis of spinel crystal. The pore structure and size distribution of as-prepared samples were studied by N 2 adsorption/desorption.Obviously, the hysteresis loops in adsorption isotherm could be seen in the Fig. 3, revealing its characteristics of mesoporous, the area of the hysteresis loop and adsorption volume decreased gradually with the increase of calcination temperature, indicating the reduction of mesopore number and surface area.The BET specific surface areas, average pore diameters, and pore volumes of samples are listed in Table 1.Obviously, as the calcination temperature raised, the BET surface area, total porous volume decreased gradually, which confirmed that the pore structure reduced with the increase of calcination temperature.Notably, the average pore sizes of samples have little change with the increase of calcination temperature, indicating the simultaneous decrease in the amount of small pore and large pore. The formation of MgFe 2 O 4 during the heating process was further explored by the thermogravimetric analysis (Fig. 4(a)).The first weight loss with a prominent endothermic phenomenon was obtained in the region of 30-200 C, corresponding to the loss of water.The decomposition of the metal hydroxides and nitrate complexes occurred between 80 and 325 C, following with two endothermic peaks at 218 and 400 C.Above 600 C the weight loss was negligible, implying the basically formed of the structure of MgFe 2 O 4 14.Notably, it can be seen clearly from partial enlargement of TG curves in Fig. 4(b) that a slight weight loss was detected in the range of 660-750 C, accompanying a weak endothermic peak, which may be related to the removal of a small amount of oxygen from the spinel structure, resulting the formation of oxygen vacancies on the surface of the sample.It can be inferred that high calcination temperature may be beneficial to form the oxygen vacancies.After that, a weight gain was found when calcination temperature was at the range of 800-850 C in Fig. 4(b).In view of the decrease of the XRD peaks for Mg-Fe-850 sample, this weight gain was likely related to the formation of iron oxide with higher valence, which was derived from the chemical reaction between MgFe 2 O 4 and oxygen at higher temperature. The XPS technique was used to probe the surface chemical composition, state of elements and valence band in Mg-Fe-650 and Mg-Fe-750 catalysts.The survey spectra (Fig. 5(a)) confirmed the presence of Mg, Fe and O elements in Mg-Fe-650 and Mg-Fe-750.high-resolution XPS spectra of Mg 1s, Fe 2p and O 1s were presented in Fig. 5(b-d).The characterized signal of Mg 1s was found at 1303.27 eV (Fig. 5(b)), corresponding to Mg 2 in MgFe 2 O 4 19; the O 1s spectrum can be divided into three peaks at 529.20 eV, 530.16 eV and 531.53 eV, which were attributed to lattice oxygen, adsorbed oxygen species and oxygen vacancies, respectively 31,383940.According to the peak area ratio of the oxygen vacancy to all oxygen species, the defective oxygen proportion of Mg-Fe-650 and Mg-Fe-750 was 21.01 and 23.92, respectively, which demonstrated that the more oxygen vacancies were formed by increasing heating temperature from 650 C to 750 C.In Fig. 5(d), the binding energies of 710.16 eV and 724.22 eV for Fe 2p 3/2 and Fe 2p 1/2 with a shake-up satellite peak at 717.97 eV were observed, representing the characteristic of Fe 3 in the hybrid 16,41.The peaks located at 709.42 eV revealed the presence of Fe 2 2p 3/2 42.Notably, Fe 3 2p 3/2 and Fe 2p 1/2 of Mg-Fe-750 obviously appeared a slight shift to higher binding energy comparing with Mg-Fe-650, indicating stronger electronic interaction in Mg-Fe-750. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR) was carried out to directly determine the existence of oxygen vacancies.As shown in Fig. 6, a significant signal was detected at g2.003 in samples calcinated at 650, 750 and 850 C.Based on previous reports, the signal peak assigned to g2.001-2.004was ascribed to electron trapped on oxygen vacancies 43,44.Therefore, abundant oxygen vacancies on the surface of MgFe 2 O 4 were successfully constructed after heating process, and the EPR results showed the concentration of oxygen vacancies increased firstly with the increase in calcination temperature, then decreased with the further increase of calcination temperature, and the Mg-Fe-750 displayed the highest EPR signal among these samples, implying higher oxygen vacancies concentration, agreement with the result of O 1s spectrum. The light absorption properties of MgFe 2 O 4 samples were investigated by an UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS).In Fig. 7(a), all samples showed excellent absorption performance in visible light region (400-650 nm), demonstrating MgFe 2 O 4 samples belonged to the narrow-band gap semiconductor materials.The intensities of light absorption for as-prepared samples increased gradually with the calcination temperature getting higher.The enhancement in light absorption with the increase of calcination temperature can be due to the formation of more spine phase and the increase of oxygen vacancies.When calcination temperature is higher than 800 C, the light absorption decreases obviously, which can be due to the destruction of spinel phase as illustrated by XRD pattern.Notably, the increase in light absorption at 600-700 nm with the increase of calcination temperature was seen, which can be caused by the electron transition from donor state, or oxygen vacancies and structure defects 45, confirming that the content of oxygen vacancies is increased.The Mg-Fe-750 and Mg-Fe-800 samples exhibited the stronger visible light absorption.It may be due to the more oxygen vacancies generated during the heating process, which was conductive to the visible light absorption of the samples.The bandgap values of MgFe 2 O 4 samples were calculated by Kubelka-Munk function 17, as shown in Fig. 7(b).For the samples Mg-Fe-T (T 650, 700, 750, 800 and 850), the band gap width was 1.99, 2.08, 2.12, 2.17 and 2.04 eV, respectively. In order to further study the band structure, the Mott-Schottky diagram (Fig. 8a) was used to evaluate the flat band potential (E FB ), carrier's concentration and semiconductor type.All curves possessed positive slope, indicating that the samples obtained were n-type semiconductors.The electrode potential was converted to the standard hydrogen electrode (NHE) potential using the following relation: The E FB of Mg-Fe-T (T 650, 700, 750, 800 and 850) were -0.17, -0.22, -0.20, -0.15 and -0.13 V (Vs.NHE), respectively.It's well known that n-type semiconductor conduction potential (E CB ) is more negative 0.1 or 0.2 V than its E FB .In this paper, -0.2 V was used to calculate the E CB .The valence band potential (E VB ) was estimated by formula (2) using the band gap values calculated in Fig. 7b and summarized in Table 2. Room temperature PL spectra were detected to investigate the separation, migration and recombination process of photogenerated All samples exhibit the emission peak at 399 nm due to the recombination photo-induced carriers.It is noted that the PL intensity decreased firstly as the increase of calcination temperature then increased and the Mg-Fe-750 sample possessed the lowest PL emission peak.This result can be ascribed to the content of oxygen vacancies.Because the existence of oxygen vacancies can promote the separation of photogenerated electron and hole pairs.It is well known that the PL peak intensity is directly proportional to the rate of the electron-hole recombination.Therefore, the Mg-Fe-750 sample may have highest photocatalytic activity as compared with other samples.The optical response and photoelectrical chemical properties of the as-prepared samples were tested by electrochemical workstation.Fig. 9(a) showed the transient photocurrent response under 10 cycles of Xeon lamp irradiation equipped with a 420 nm cutoff filter.As can be seen in Fig. 9(a), all samples displayed photocurrent response under visible light irradiation, and photocurrent firstly increased gradually, then decreased with the increase of calcination temperature, Mg-Fe-750 sample have the highest photocurrent.When calcination temperature is lower, the enhancement of photocurrent with the increase of calcination temperature could be attributed to the increase of spine phase and oxygen vacancies content, the decline of photocurrent with further increase of calcination temperature might be due to the decrease of oxygen vacancy concentration and the destruction of spinel phase.In addition, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was investigated, as shown in Fig. 9(b).The arc radius of the Nyquist curves of the Mg-Fe-750 was smallest, indicating it had lowest interfacial resistance and highest charge carrier separation efficiency at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Since the chemisorption and activation of CO 2 on the surface of photocatalysts is directly related to the activity of photocatalyst, TPD and in-situ FTIR for CO 2 chemisorption were carried out to investigate the effects of calcination temperature on the absorption properties of CO 2 on the surface of Mg-Fe-T samples.Fig. 10(a) shows the results of TPD for CO 2 adsorption on the surface of Mg-Fe-T samples.For all catalysts, one peak centered at 127 C was observed, which was attributed to the desorption of CO 2 molecule.With the increase of calcination temperature of samples, the desorption amount of CO 2 increased firstly and then decreased, demonstrating the significant influence of calcination temperature on the adsorption amount of CO 2 .Mg-Fe-750 exhibited the largest adsorption amount of CO 2 , which can be related to the highest oxygen vacancy concentrate generated from the removal of oxygen. In order to determine the species of CO 2 intermediates on the surface of photocatalysts, in situ FTIR spectra after the adsorption of CO 2 for 1 h at 100 C on the surfaces of Mg-Fe-T in the dark were performed.As shown in the Fig. 10 (b), after the adsorption of CO 2 , the bands at 1330 cm -1 attributed to the monodentate carbonate group (m-CO 3 2-) 46, at 1351 cm -1 assigned to bidentate carbonate (b-CO 3 2-) 23, at 1300 cm -1 related to the vibration of adsorbed carbonate or bicarbonate 47, and at 1250 cm -1 belonged to the COO -species 48 were detected.These results showed that the adsorption of CO 2 on the surface of Mg-Fe-T promoted the formation of m-CO 3 , b-CO 3 2-and COO -, which have been reported as the reactive adsorbed species in photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 6,47,49. Similarly, the intensity of FTIR bands increased firstly and then decreased with the increase of calcination temperature, which is mainly due to the content of oxygen vacancies. The photocatalytic performance of as-prepared samples was evaluated by photocatalytic CO 2 reduction using water as a reducing agent at 160 C under visible light irradiation.The control tests were carried out and verified that no products were produced with the absence of light or photocatalyst.Additionally, when CO 2 was replaced by N 2 , only H 2 but no carbon containing product was detected, implying that the carbon-containing product was originated from CO 2 . Besides oxygen, H 2 and CO were found to be the major CO 2 reduction products.Fig. 11(a) displayed the average production rate of H 2 and CO from CO 2 reduction with H 2 O vapor over Mg-Fe-T (T 650, 700, 750, 800 and 850) during 2 h reaction under visible light irradiation (420 nm).It can be seen clearly that calcination temperature has a significant influence on photocatalytic activity.After 2 h irradiation, CO average production rates were 4.7, 13.3, 24.4,17.8 and 9.8 mol/gcat/h, and H 2 production rates was 17.5, 23.6, 34.3, 25.4 and 19.3 mol/gcat/h for Mg-Fe-650, Mg-Fe-700, Mg-Fe-750, Mg-Fe-800 and Mg-Fe-850, respectively.Obviously, the activity of photocatalysts increases with the increase of calcination temperature and reaches maxima at 750 C.After that, the activity decreases with further increasing of calcination temperature.Mg-Fe-750 exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity of CO 2 reduction among all samples, for which H 2 and CO production rates were about 5 and 2 times that of Mg-Fe-650 calcined at lower temperature.In addition, the selectivity of photo-generated electron for CO 2 reduction was calculated to be 21.1, 36, 41.6, 41.2 and 33.7 for Mg-Fe-650, Mg-Fe-700, Mg-Fe-750, Mg-Fe-800 and Mg-Fe-850, respectively.Obviously, the Mg-Fe-750 samples possesses the highest selectivity of CO 2 reduction. The stability of the used Mg-Fe-750 sample was further evaluated by circle experiments and the results was showed in Fig. 11 (b).The activity of as-prepared Mg-Fe-750 was still satisfactory after five cycles.The CO and H 2 production rates were decreased by 35.0 and 17.5 compared to those of the fresh photocatalyst, respectively.The decrease of yield was likely due to the reduction of oxygen vacancy on the surface of photocatalyst, which was repaired by oxygen from CO 2 molecule or O 2 formed during the photocatalytic reaction.This resulted into the decrease of photo absorption capacity and separation efficiency of photogenerated electron-hole pairs of Mg-Fe-750 sample, thus decreasing the photocatalytic activity. According to EPR, XPS, UV/vis DRS, PL spectra, photocurrent measurements, CO 2 -TPD and in situ FTIR results, the improvement in photocatalytic activity of Mg-Fe-T samples calcined at high temperature should be mainly ascribed to the content of spinel phase and oxygen vacancies.Firstly, the calcination temperature influences the crystal phase composition of Mg-Fe-T samples, and the samples calcined at lower temperature (600 C and 700 C) showed the presence of Fe 2 O 3 , which decreased the content of spinel phase.Also,"}, {"llm generation": "Mg-Fe-T samples", "source": "According to EPR, XPS, UV/vis DRS, PL spectra, photocurrent measurements, CO 2 -TPD and in situ FTIR results, the improvement in photocatalytic activity of Mg-Fe-T samples calcined at high temperature should be mainly ascribed to the content of spinel phase and oxygen vacancies.", "context": "The XRD patterns of Mg-Fe-T samples were shown in Fig. 1.It can be seen clearly that all samples display the diffraction peaks at 2 30.2,35.5, 43.2, 53.6, 57.1 and 62.7, corresponded to (220), (311), (400), ( 422), ( 511) and (440) crystal plane of cubic MgFe 2 O 4 (JCPDS 36-0398) 34, respectively, which indicates the formation of MgFe 2 O 4 spinel phase.However, the characteristic peaks of hematite Fe 2 O 3 at the 2 33.1,40.8, 49.5 and 64.0 were detected (JCPDS 33-0664) when calcination temperature is much lower than 750 C and these peaks disappeared with the further increase of the temperature.In addition, the intensity of XRD diffraction peaks ascribed to spinel phase was getting more intense and sharper as the calcination temperature increased from 650 to 800 C, indicating that the crystallinity or particle size of MgFe 2 O 4 spinel phase increased with the increase of temperature.However, when calcination temperature reached 850 C, the XRD peak became weak compared to that of Mg-Fe-850 sample, revealing a slight destroy of spinel phase at higher temperature.The crystal size of each sample was estimated by Debye-Scherrer's formula according to their (311) planes, which are subsequently 38.1 nm, 42.7 nm, 45.6 nm, 48.5 nm and 50.3 nm, respectively, showing that the particle sizes increased gradually with the increase of temperature due to the crystal growth.

The light absorption properties of MgFe 2 O 4 samples were investigated by an UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS).In Fig. 7(a), all samples showed excellent absorption performance in visible light region (400-650 nm), demonstrating MgFe 2 O 4 samples belonged to the narrow-band gap semiconductor materials.The intensities of light absorption for as-prepared samples increased gradually with the calcination temperature getting higher.The enhancement in light absorption with the increase of calcination temperature can be due to the formation of more spine phase and the increase of oxygen vacancies.When calcination temperature is higher than 800 C, the light absorption decreases obviously, which can be due to the destruction of spinel phase as illustrated by XRD pattern.Notably, the increase in light absorption at 600-700 nm with the increase of calcination temperature was seen, which can be caused by the electron transition from donor state, or oxygen vacancies and structure defects 45, confirming that the content of oxygen vacancies is increased.The Mg-Fe-750 and Mg-Fe-800 samples exhibited the stronger visible light absorption.It may be due to the more oxygen vacancies generated during the heating process, which was conductive to the visible light absorption of the samples.The bandgap values of MgFe 2 O 4 samples were calculated by Kubelka-Munk function 17, as shown in Fig. 7(b).For the samples Mg-Fe-T (T 650, 700, 750, 800 and 850), the band gap width was 1.99, 2.08, 2.12, 2.17 and 2.04 eV, respectively. In order to further study the band structure, the Mott-Schottky diagram (Fig. 8a) was used to evaluate the flat band potential (E FB ), carrier's concentration and semiconductor type.All curves possessed positive slope, indicating that the samples obtained were n-type semiconductors.The electrode potential was converted to the standard hydrogen electrode (NHE) potential using the following relation: The E FB of Mg-Fe-T (T 650, 700, 750, 800 and 850) were -0.17, -0.22, -0.20, -0.15 and -0.13 V (Vs.NHE), respectively.It's well known that n-type semiconductor conduction potential (E CB ) is more negative 0.1 or 0.2 V than its E FB .In this paper, -0.2 V was used to calculate the E CB .The valence band potential (E VB ) was estimated by formula (2) using the band gap values calculated in Fig. 7b and summarized in Table 2. Room temperature PL spectra were detected to investigate the separation, migration and recombination process of photogenerated All samples exhibit the emission peak at 399 nm due to the recombination photo-induced carriers.It is noted that the PL intensity decreased firstly as the increase of calcination temperature then increased and the Mg-Fe-750 sample possessed the lowest PL emission peak.This result can be ascribed to the content of oxygen vacancies.Because the existence of oxygen vacancies can promote the separation of photogenerated electron and hole pairs.It is well known that the PL peak intensity is directly proportional to the rate of the electron-hole recombination.Therefore, the Mg-Fe-750 sample may have highest photocatalytic activity as compared with other samples.The optical response and photoelectrical chemical properties of the as-prepared samples were tested by electrochemical workstation.Fig. 9(a) showed the transient photocurrent response under 10 cycles of Xeon lamp irradiation equipped with a 420 nm cutoff filter.As can be seen in Fig. 9(a), all samples displayed photocurrent response under visible light irradiation, and photocurrent firstly increased gradually, then decreased with the increase of calcination temperature, Mg-Fe-750 sample have the highest photocurrent.When calcination temperature is lower, the enhancement of photocurrent with the increase of calcination temperature could be attributed to the increase of spine phase and oxygen vacancies content, the decline of photocurrent with further increase of calcination temperature might be due to the decrease of oxygen vacancy concentration and the destruction of spinel phase.In addition, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was investigated, as shown in Fig. 9(b).The arc radius of the Nyquist curves of the Mg-Fe-750 was smallest, indicating it had lowest interfacial resistance and highest charge carrier separation efficiency at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Since the chemisorption and activation of CO 2 on the surface of photocatalysts is directly related to the activity of photocatalyst, TPD and in-situ FTIR for CO 2 chemisorption were carried out to investigate the effects of calcination temperature on the absorption properties of CO 2 on the surface of Mg-Fe-T samples.Fig. 10(a) shows the results of TPD for CO 2 adsorption on the surface of Mg-Fe-T samples.For all catalysts, one peak centered at 127 C was observed, which was attributed to the desorption of CO 2 molecule.With the increase of calcination temperature of samples, the desorption amount of CO 2 increased firstly and then decreased, demonstrating the significant influence of calcination temperature on the adsorption amount of CO 2 .Mg-Fe-750 exhibited the largest adsorption amount of CO 2 , which can be related to the highest oxygen vacancy concentrate generated from the removal of oxygen. In order to determine the species of CO 2 intermediates on the surface of photocatalysts, in situ FTIR spectra after the adsorption of CO 2 for 1 h at 100 C on the surfaces of Mg-Fe-T in the dark were performed.As shown in the Fig. 10 (b), after the adsorption of CO 2 , the bands at 1330 cm -1 attributed to the monodentate carbonate group (m-CO 3 2-) 46, at 1351 cm -1 assigned to bidentate carbonate (b-CO 3 2-) 23, at 1300 cm -1 related to the vibration of adsorbed carbonate or bicarbonate 47, and at 1250 cm -1 belonged to the COO -species 48 were detected.These results showed that the adsorption of CO 2 on the surface of Mg-Fe-T promoted the formation of m-CO 3 , b-CO 3 2-and COO -, which have been reported as the reactive adsorbed species in photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 6,47,49. Similarly, the intensity of FTIR bands increased firstly and then decreased with the increase of calcination temperature, which is mainly due to the content of oxygen vacancies. The photocatalytic performance of as-prepared samples was evaluated by photocatalytic CO 2 reduction using water as a reducing agent at 160 C under visible light irradiation.The control tests were carried out and verified that no products were produced with the absence of light or photocatalyst.Additionally, when CO 2 was replaced by N 2 , only H 2 but no carbon containing product was detected, implying that the carbon-containing product was originated from CO 2 . Besides oxygen, H 2 and CO were found to be the major CO 2 reduction products.Fig. 11(a) displayed the average production rate of H 2 and CO from CO 2 reduction with H 2 O vapor over Mg-Fe-T (T 650, 700, 750, 800 and 850) during 2 h reaction under visible light irradiation (420 nm).It can be seen clearly that calcination temperature has a significant influence on photocatalytic activity.After 2 h irradiation, CO average production rates were 4.7, 13.3, 24.4,17.8 and 9.8 mol/gcat/h, and H 2 production rates was 17.5, 23.6, 34.3, 25.4 and 19.3 mol/gcat/h for Mg-Fe-650, Mg-Fe-700, Mg-Fe-750, Mg-Fe-800 and Mg-Fe-850, respectively.Obviously, the activity of photocatalysts increases with the increase of calcination temperature and reaches maxima at 750 C.After that, the activity decreases with further increasing of calcination temperature.Mg-Fe-750 exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity of CO 2 reduction among all samples, for which H 2 and CO production rates were about 5 and 2 times that of Mg-Fe-650 calcined at lower temperature.In addition, the selectivity of photo-generated electron for CO 2 reduction was calculated to be 21.1, 36, 41.6, 41.2 and 33.7 for Mg-Fe-650, Mg-Fe-700, Mg-Fe-750, Mg-Fe-800 and Mg-Fe-850, respectively.Obviously, the Mg-Fe-750 samples possesses the highest selectivity of CO 2 reduction. The stability of the used Mg-Fe-750 sample was further evaluated by circle experiments and the results was showed in Fig. 11 (b).The activity of as-prepared Mg-Fe-750 was still satisfactory after five cycles.The CO and H 2 production rates were decreased by 35.0 and 17.5 compared to those of the fresh photocatalyst, respectively.The decrease of yield was likely due to the reduction of oxygen vacancy on the surface of photocatalyst, which was repaired by oxygen from CO 2 molecule or O 2 formed during the photocatalytic reaction.This resulted into the decrease of photo absorption capacity and separation efficiency of photogenerated electron-hole pairs of Mg-Fe-750 sample, thus decreasing the photocatalytic activity. According to EPR, XPS, UV/vis DRS, PL spectra, photocurrent measurements, CO 2 -TPD and in situ FTIR results, the improvement in photocatalytic activity of Mg-Fe-T samples calcined at high temperature should be mainly ascribed to the content of spinel phase and oxygen vacancies.Firstly, the calcination temperature influences the crystal phase composition of Mg-Fe-T samples, and the samples calcined at lower temperature (600 C and 700 C) showed the presence of Fe 2 O 3 , which decreased the content of spinel phase.Also,"}, {"llm generation": "MgFe 2 O 4 spinel", "source": "In conclusion, we have demonstrated that MgFe 2 O 4 spinel with abundant oxygen vacancies represent an excellent material for CO 2 reduction.", "context": "In conclusion, we have demonstrated that MgFe 2 O 4 spinel with abundant oxygen vacancies represent an excellent material for CO 2 reduction.The structure, morphology, photoelectric and CO 2 chemisorption properties of the obtained samples were characterized.Moreover, XPS and EPR both proved that the successful introduction of oxygen vacancies.The vacancies significantly reinforced the light response in visible region, enhanced the CO 2 molecules chemically adsorption and facilitated the transfer of photogenerated electronholes.Additionally, the application of MgFe 2 O 4 in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was studied in detail.The results showed the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity was the optimal when the sample was calcinated at 750 C, and the highest production rate of CO and H 2 was 24.4 and 34.3 mol/gcat/h, respectively.Our finding suggested that the method of introducing oxygen vacancies efficiently promoted the photocatalytic properties of MgFe 2 O 4 .

The morphologies of photocatalysts were captured by a HITACHI JEOL-2100F transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and more details were further obtained by higher magnification transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) at 200 kV accelerating voltage.The structure and crystalline size were detected by an X-ray diffractometer (Bruker D8-Focus, Cu-K, 0.15418 nm, 40 kV, 200 mA).The patterns were examined in the 2 range of 10-90 and scanning rate was 10/min.Thermogravimetric analysis was operated under air atmosphere at 5 C/min in the range of room temperature to 900 C.Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms were measured using an American Quantachrome Autosorb analyzer at -196 C.Prior to the analysis, all of the samples were vacuumed at 200 C for 6 h.The surface area and pore volume were calculated using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method.The valence states of elements were obtained by an X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).The oxygen vacancies were determined by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR) with a Brook a300. UV-vis diffuse spectra (DRS) were characterized by an UV-vis spectrometer (PerkinElmer, Lambda 750) to judge the visible light absorption capacity of the photocatalysts.The scanning range was 200-800 nm and BaSO 4 was used as the background.Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were tested via a Fluorolog three photoluminescence spectrometer (Horiba Jobin Yvon, Japan).The excitation wavelength was 280 nm, the scanning wavelength range was 300-750 nm, and the slit width was 1 nm.Photoelectrochemical measurements were performed using an electrochemical workstation (CHI-650E, Chenhua Company, Shanghai, China) with a three-electrode system.The test was conducted at room temperature using 0.1 mol/L Na 2 SO 4 as electrolyte solution.The as-prepared samples electrodes on the ITO glass were served as the working electrode.The Ag/AgCl electrode acted as the reference electrode and platinum sheet worked as the counter electrode, respectively. The CO 2 chemical adsorption ability of as-prepared samples was evaluated by temperature programmed desorption (TPD-CO 2 ).0.3 g catalyst samples were filled in a quartz tube and purged with nitrogen at 773 K for 2 h.After the reactor was cooled to a specific temperature, the CO 2 was introduced in the way of pulse to achieve a saturation chemisorption.Following, the samples was purged with He gas to the equilibrium, and the temperature was increased to 500 C at the rate of 5 C/min.The desorbed products were measured by TCD detector. The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction experiment was carried out in a homemade stainless vessel reactor with H 2 O vapor under visible light irradiation ( 420 nm).Before the catalytic reaction, and the trace impurities in CO 2 (CO and O 2 ) was removed by Cu and CuO at 650 C.50 mg catalyst powder was evenly dispersed in the reactor tray.Prior to light irradiation, the reactor was rinsed with CO 2 (30 mL/min) for 1 h at 160 C to remove the air in the reactor and the organic substances adsorbed on the catalyst surface.Then, all the valves of the reactor were closed to form a sealed system.0.3 mL deionized water was injected into reactor.Subsequently, the 300 W xenon lamp (PLS-SXE 300C xenon lamp) equipped with a 420 nm cutoff filter was used as the simulated light source.After irradiated at 160 C for 2 h, the products were analyzed by an on-line gas chromatography using a thermal conductivity detector (Agilent 4890, nitrogen as carrier gas)."}, {"llm generation": "UV-Vis", "source": "The light absorption properties of MgFe 2 O 4 samples were investigated by an UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS).", "context": "The XRD patterns of Mg-Fe-T samples were shown in Fig. 1.It can be seen clearly that all samples display the diffraction peaks at 2 30.2,35.5, 43.2, 53.6, 57.1 and 62.7, corresponded to (220), (311), (400), ( 422), ( 511) and (440) crystal plane of cubic MgFe 2 O 4 (JCPDS 36-0398) 34, respectively, which indicates the formation of MgFe 2 O 4 spinel phase.However, the characteristic peaks of hematite Fe 2 O 3 at the 2 33.1,40.8, 49.5 and 64.0 were detected (JCPDS 33-0664) when calcination temperature is much lower than 750 C and these peaks disappeared with the further increase of the temperature.In addition, the intensity of XRD diffraction peaks ascribed to spinel phase was getting more intense and sharper as the calcination temperature increased from 650 to 800 C, indicating that the crystallinity or particle size of MgFe 2 O 4 spinel phase increased with the increase of temperature.However, when calcination temperature reached 850 C, the XRD peak became weak compared to that of Mg-Fe-850 sample, revealing a slight destroy of spinel phase at higher temperature.The crystal size of each sample was estimated by Debye-Scherrer's formula according to their (311) planes, which are subsequently 38.1 nm, 42.7 nm, 45.6 nm, 48.5 nm and 50.3 nm, respectively, showing that the particle sizes increased gradually with the increase of temperature due to the crystal growth. FTIR spectra of MgFe 2 O 4 ferrite prepared at different calcinated temperature were shown in Fig. 1(b).For precursor, a weak peak around 1385 cm -1 was assigned to the vibration of nitrate 35, which may be due to the presence of residual inorganic salts in the samples.No characteristic peak of spinel was found in the precursor, indicating the spinel structure was formed after calcination.In Mg-Fe-T samples, the characteristic bands at 430 cm -1 and 551 cm -1 attributed to the stretching vibration of metal-oxygen bond at octahedral and tetrahedron, and the high frequency bands around 1000 cm -1 ascribed to stretching intrinsic vibration of unit cell of spinel in tetrahedral sites 36 were observed, confirming the formation of cubic spinel structure 37.As the calcination temperature raised, the FTIR bands became strong, and then weakened when temperature is high than 800 C, which was consistence with XRD patterns. The morphology of the samples was analyzed in detail using the TEM images.As shown in Fig. 2, all MgFe 2 O 4 samples prepared by coprecipitation exhibited particle morphology, and some particles aggregated into layer due to the magnetic force of ferrite 23.With the increase of calcination temperature, the morphology of the samples was transformed gradually to cube structure, and the particle sizes of Mg-Fe-T have a slight increase with the increase of calcination temperature.The lattice fringes with the lattice spacing about 0.26 nm, contributed to the (311) crystal facet of cubic MgFe 2 O 4 , was clearly observed from the HR-TEM images (h), which verified the successful synthesis of spinel crystal. The pore structure and size distribution of as-prepared samples were studied by N 2 adsorption/desorption.Obviously, the hysteresis loops in adsorption isotherm could be seen in the Fig. 3, revealing its characteristics of mesoporous, the area of the hysteresis loop and adsorption volume decreased gradually with the increase of calcination temperature, indicating the reduction of mesopore number and surface area.The BET specific surface areas, average pore diameters, and pore volumes of samples are listed in Table 1.Obviously, as the calcination temperature raised, the BET surface area, total porous volume decreased gradually, which confirmed that the pore structure reduced with the increase of calcination temperature.Notably, the average pore sizes of samples have little change with the increase of calcination temperature, indicating the simultaneous decrease in the amount of small pore and large pore. The formation of MgFe 2 O 4 during the heating process was further explored by the thermogravimetric analysis (Fig. 4(a)).The first weight loss with a prominent endothermic phenomenon was obtained in the region of 30-200 C, corresponding to the loss of water.The decomposition of the metal hydroxides and nitrate complexes occurred between 80 and 325 C, following with two endothermic peaks at 218 and 400 C.Above 600 C the weight loss was negligible, implying the basically formed of the structure of MgFe 2 O 4 14.Notably, it can be seen clearly from partial enlargement of TG curves in Fig. 4(b) that a slight weight loss was detected in the range of 660-750 C, accompanying a weak endothermic peak, which may be related to the removal of a small amount of oxygen from the spinel structure, resulting the formation of oxygen vacancies on the surface of the sample.It can be inferred that high calcination temperature may be beneficial to form the oxygen vacancies.After that, a weight gain was found when calcination temperature was at the range of 800-850 C in Fig. 4(b).In view of the decrease of the XRD peaks for Mg-Fe-850 sample, this weight gain was likely related to the formation of iron oxide with higher valence, which was derived from the chemical reaction between MgFe 2 O 4 and oxygen at higher temperature. The XPS technique was used to probe the surface chemical composition, state of elements and valence band in Mg-Fe-650 and Mg-Fe-750 catalysts.The survey spectra (Fig. 5(a)) confirmed the presence of Mg, Fe and O elements in Mg-Fe-650 and Mg-Fe-750.high-resolution XPS spectra of Mg 1s, Fe 2p and O 1s were presented in Fig. 5(b-d).The characterized signal of Mg 1s was found at 1303.27 eV (Fig. 5(b)), corresponding to Mg 2 in MgFe 2 O 4 19; the O 1s spectrum can be divided into three peaks at 529.20 eV, 530.16 eV and 531.53 eV, which were attributed to lattice oxygen, adsorbed oxygen species and oxygen vacancies, respectively 31,383940.According to the peak area ratio of the oxygen vacancy to all oxygen species, the defective oxygen proportion of Mg-Fe-650 and Mg-Fe-750 was 21.01 and 23.92, respectively, which demonstrated that the more oxygen vacancies were formed by increasing heating temperature from 650 C to 750 C.In Fig. 5(d), the binding energies of 710.16 eV and 724.22 eV for Fe 2p 3/2 and Fe 2p 1/2 with a shake-up satellite peak at 717.97 eV were observed, representing the characteristic of Fe 3 in the hybrid 16,41.The peaks located at 709.42 eV revealed the presence of Fe 2 2p 3/2 42.Notably, Fe 3 2p 3/2 and Fe 2p 1/2 of Mg-Fe-750 obviously appeared a slight shift to higher binding energy comparing with Mg-Fe-650, indicating stronger electronic interaction in Mg-Fe-750. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR) was carried out to directly determine the existence of oxygen vacancies.As shown in Fig. 6, a significant signal was detected at g2.003 in samples calcinated at 650, 750 and 850 C.Based on previous reports, the signal peak assigned to g2.001-2.004was ascribed to electron trapped on oxygen vacancies 43,44.Therefore, abundant oxygen vacancies on the surface of MgFe 2 O 4 were successfully constructed after heating process, and the EPR results showed the concentration of oxygen vacancies increased firstly with the increase in calcination temperature, then decreased with the further increase of calcination temperature, and the Mg-Fe-750 displayed the highest EPR signal among these samples, implying higher oxygen vacancies concentration, agreement with the result of O 1s spectrum. The light absorption properties of MgFe 2 O 4 samples were investigated by an UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS).In Fig. 7(a), all samples showed excellent absorption performance in visible light region (400-650 nm), demonstrating MgFe 2 O 4 samples belonged to the narrow-band gap semiconductor materials.The intensities of light absorption for as-prepared samples increased gradually with the calcination temperature getting higher.The enhancement in light absorption with the increase of calcination temperature can be due to the formation of more spine phase and the increase of oxygen vacancies.When calcination temperature is higher than 800 C, the light absorption decreases obviously, which can be due to the destruction of spinel phase as illustrated by XRD pattern.Notably, the increase in light absorption at 600-700 nm with the increase of calcination temperature was seen, which can be caused by the electron transition from donor state, or oxygen vacancies and structure defects 45, confirming that the content of oxygen vacancies is increased.The Mg-Fe-750 and Mg-Fe-800 samples exhibited the stronger visible light absorption.It may be due to the more oxygen vacancies generated during the heating process, which was conductive to the visible light absorption of the samples.The bandgap values of MgFe 2 O 4 samples were calculated by Kubelka-Munk function 17, as shown in Fig. 7(b).For the samples Mg-Fe-T (T 650, 700, 750, 800 and 850), the band gap width was 1.99, 2.08, 2.12, 2.17 and 2.04 eV, respectively. In order to further study the band structure, the Mott-Schottky diagram (Fig. 8a) was used to evaluate the flat band potential (E FB ), carrier's concentration and semiconductor type.All curves possessed positive slope, indicating that the samples obtained were n-type semiconductors.The electrode potential was converted to the standard hydrogen electrode (NHE) potential using the following relation: The E FB of Mg-Fe-T (T 650, 700, 750, 800 and 850) were -0.17, -0.22, -0.20, -0.15 and -0.13 V (Vs.NHE), respectively.It's well known that n-type semiconductor conduction potential (E CB ) is more negative 0.1 or 0.2 V than its E FB .In this paper, -0.2 V was used to calculate the E CB .The valence band potential (E VB ) was estimated by formula (2) using the band gap values calculated in Fig. 7b and summarized in Table 2. Room temperature PL spectra were detected to investigate the separation, migration and recombination process of photogenerated All samples exhibit the emission peak at 399 nm due to the recombination photo-induced carriers.It is noted that the PL intensity decreased firstly as the increase of calcination temperature then increased and the Mg-Fe-750 sample possessed the lowest PL emission peak.This result can be ascribed to the content of oxygen vacancies.Because the existence of oxygen vacancies can promote the separation of photogenerated electron and hole pairs.It is well known that the PL peak intensity is directly proportional to the rate of the electron-hole recombination.Therefore, the Mg-Fe-750 sample may have highest photocatalytic activity as compared with other samples.The optical response and photoelectrical chemical properties of the as-prepared samples were tested by electrochemical workstation.Fig. 9(a) showed the transient photocurrent response under 10 cycles of Xeon lamp irradiation equipped with a 420 nm cutoff filter.As can be seen in Fig. 9(a), all samples displayed photocurrent response under visible light irradiation, and photocurrent firstly increased gradually, then decreased with the increase of calcination temperature, Mg-Fe-750 sample have the highest photocurrent.When calcination temperature is lower, the enhancement of photocurrent with the increase of calcination temperature could be attributed to the increase of spine phase and oxygen vacancies content, the decline of photocurrent with further increase of calcination temperature might be due to the decrease of oxygen vacancy concentration and the destruction of spinel phase.In addition, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was investigated, as shown in Fig. 9(b).The arc radius of the Nyquist curves of the Mg-Fe-750 was smallest, indicating it had lowest interfacial resistance and highest charge carrier separation efficiency at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Since the chemisorption and activation of CO 2 on the surface of photocatalysts is directly related to the activity of photocatalyst, TPD and in-situ FTIR for CO 2 chemisorption were carried out to investigate the effects of calcination temperature on the absorption properties of CO 2 on the surface of Mg-Fe-T samples.Fig. 10(a) shows the results of TPD for CO 2 adsorption on the surface of Mg-Fe-T samples.For all catalysts, one peak centered at 127 C was observed, which was attributed to the desorption of CO 2 molecule.With the increase of calcination temperature of samples, the desorption amount of CO 2 increased firstly and then decreased, demonstrating the significant influence of calcination temperature on the adsorption amount of CO 2 .Mg-Fe-750 exhibited the largest adsorption amount of CO 2 , which can be related to the highest oxygen vacancy concentrate generated from the removal of oxygen. In order to determine the species of CO 2 intermediates on the surface of photocatalysts, in situ FTIR spectra after the adsorption of CO 2 for 1 h at 100 C on the surfaces of Mg-Fe-T in the dark were performed.As shown in the Fig. 10 (b), after the adsorption of CO 2 , the bands at 1330 cm -1 attributed to the monodentate carbonate group (m-CO 3 2-) 46, at 1351 cm -1 assigned to bidentate carbonate (b-CO 3 2-) 23, at 1300 cm -1 related to the vibration of adsorbed carbonate or bicarbonate 47, and at 1250 cm -1 belonged to the COO -species 48 were detected.These results showed that the adsorption of CO 2 on the surface of Mg-Fe-T promoted the formation of m-CO 3 , b-CO 3 2-and COO -, which have been reported as the reactive adsorbed species in photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 6,47,49. Similarly, the intensity of FTIR bands increased firstly and then decreased with the increase of calcination temperature, which is mainly due to the content of oxygen vacancies. The photocatalytic performance of as-prepared samples was evaluated by photocatalytic CO 2 reduction using water as a reducing agent at 160 C under visible light irradiation.The control tests were carried out and verified that no products were produced with the absence of light or photocatalyst.Additionally, when CO 2 was replaced by N 2 , only H 2 but no carbon containing product was detected, implying that the carbon-containing product was originated from CO 2 . Besides oxygen, H 2 and CO were found to be the major CO 2 reduction products.Fig. 11(a) displayed the average production rate of H 2 and CO from CO 2 reduction with H 2 O vapor over Mg-Fe-T (T 650, 700, 750, 800 and 850) during 2 h reaction under visible light irradiation (420 nm).It can be seen clearly that calcination temperature has a significant influence on photocatalytic activity.After 2 h irradiation, CO average production rates were 4.7, 13.3, 24.4,17.8 and 9.8 mol/gcat/h, and H 2 production rates was 17.5, 23.6, 34.3, 25.4 and 19.3 mol/gcat/h for Mg-Fe-650, Mg-Fe-700, Mg-Fe-750, Mg-Fe-800 and Mg-Fe-850, respectively.Obviously, the activity of photocatalysts increases with the increase of calcination temperature and reaches maxima at 750 C.After that, the activity decreases with further increasing of calcination temperature.Mg-Fe-750 exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity of CO 2 reduction among all samples, for which H 2 and CO production rates were about 5 and 2 times that of Mg-Fe-650 calcined at lower temperature.In addition, the selectivity of photo-generated electron for CO 2 reduction was calculated to be 21.1, 36, 41.6, 41.2 and 33.7 for Mg-Fe-650, Mg-Fe-700, Mg-Fe-750, Mg-Fe-800 and Mg-Fe-850, respectively.Obviously, the Mg-Fe-750 samples possesses the highest selectivity of CO 2 reduction. The stability of the used Mg-Fe-750 sample was further evaluated by circle experiments and the results was showed in Fig. 11 (b).The activity of as-prepared Mg-Fe-750 was still satisfactory after five cycles.The CO and H 2 production rates were decreased by 35.0 and 17.5 compared to those of the fresh photocatalyst, respectively.The decrease of yield was likely due to the reduction of oxygen vacancy on the surface of photocatalyst, which was repaired by oxygen from CO 2 molecule or O 2 formed during the photocatalytic reaction.This resulted into the decrease of photo absorption capacity and separation efficiency of photogenerated electron-hole pairs of Mg-Fe-750 sample, thus decreasing the photocatalytic activity. According to EPR, XPS, UV/vis DRS, PL spectra, photocurrent measurements, CO 2 -TPD and in situ FTIR results, the improvement in photocatalytic activity of Mg-Fe-T samples calcined at high temperature should be mainly ascribed to the content of spinel phase and oxygen vacancies.Firstly, the calcination temperature influences the crystal phase composition of Mg-Fe-T samples, and the samples calcined at lower temperature (600 C and 700 C) showed the presence of Fe 2 O 3 , which decreased the content of spinel phase.Also,"}, {"llm generation": "visible light (420 nm cutoff filter)", "source": "Fig. 9(a) showed the transient photocurrent response under 10 cycles of Xeon lamp irradiation equipped with a 420 nm cutoff filter.", "context": "The XRD patterns of Mg-Fe-T samples were shown in Fig. 1.It can be seen clearly that all samples display the diffraction peaks at 2 30.2,35.5, 43.2, 53.6, 57.1 and 62.7, corresponded to (220), (311), (400), ( 422), ( 511) and (440) crystal plane of cubic MgFe 2 O 4 (JCPDS 36-0398) 34, respectively, which indicates the formation of MgFe 2 O 4 spinel phase.However, the characteristic peaks of hematite Fe 2 O 3 at the 2 33.1,40.8, 49.5 and 64.0 were detected (JCPDS 33-0664) when calcination temperature is much lower than 750 C and these peaks disappeared with the further increase of the temperature.In addition, the intensity of XRD diffraction peaks ascribed to spinel phase was getting more intense and sharper as the calcination temperature increased from 650 to 800 C, indicating that the crystallinity or particle size of MgFe 2 O 4 spinel phase increased with the increase of temperature.However, when calcination temperature reached 850 C, the XRD peak became weak compared to that of Mg-Fe-850 sample, revealing a slight destroy of spinel phase at higher temperature.The crystal size of each sample was estimated by Debye-Scherrer's formula according to their (311) planes, which are subsequently 38.1 nm, 42.7 nm, 45.6 nm, 48.5 nm and 50.3 nm, respectively, showing that the particle sizes increased gradually with the increase of temperature due to the crystal growth. FTIR spectra of MgFe 2 O 4 ferrite prepared at different calcinated temperature were shown in Fig. 1(b).For precursor, a weak peak around 1385 cm -1 was assigned to the vibration of nitrate 35, which may be due to the presence of residual inorganic salts in the samples.No characteristic peak of spinel was found in the precursor, indicating the spinel structure was formed after calcination.In Mg-Fe-T samples, the characteristic bands at 430 cm -1 and 551 cm -1 attributed to the stretching vibration of metal-oxygen bond at octahedral and tetrahedron, and the high frequency bands around 1000 cm -1 ascribed to stretching intrinsic vibration of unit cell of spinel in tetrahedral sites 36 were observed, confirming the formation of cubic spinel structure 37.As the calcination temperature raised, the FTIR bands became strong, and then weakened when temperature is high than 800 C, which was consistence with XRD patterns. The morphology of the samples was analyzed in detail using the TEM images.As shown in Fig. 2, all MgFe 2 O 4 samples prepared by coprecipitation exhibited particle morphology, and some particles aggregated into layer due to the magnetic force of ferrite 23.With the increase of calcination temperature, the morphology of the samples was transformed gradually to cube structure, and the particle sizes of Mg-Fe-T have a slight increase with the increase of calcination temperature.The lattice fringes with the lattice spacing about 0.26 nm, contributed to the (311) crystal facet of cubic MgFe 2 O 4 , was clearly observed from the HR-TEM images (h), which verified the successful synthesis of spinel crystal. The pore structure and size distribution of as-prepared samples were studied by N 2 adsorption/desorption.Obviously, the hysteresis loops in adsorption isotherm could be seen in the Fig. 3, revealing its characteristics of mesoporous, the area of the hysteresis loop and adsorption volume decreased gradually with the increase of calcination temperature, indicating the reduction of mesopore number and surface area.The BET specific surface areas, average pore diameters, and pore volumes of samples are listed in Table 1.Obviously, as the calcination temperature raised, the BET surface area, total porous volume decreased gradually, which confirmed that the pore structure reduced with the increase of calcination temperature.Notably, the average pore sizes of samples have little change with the increase of calcination temperature, indicating the simultaneous decrease in the amount of small pore and large pore. The formation of MgFe 2 O 4 during the heating process was further explored by the thermogravimetric analysis (Fig. 4(a)).The first weight loss with a prominent endothermic phenomenon was obtained in the region of 30-200 C, corresponding to the loss of water.The decomposition of the metal hydroxides and nitrate complexes occurred between 80 and 325 C, following with two endothermic peaks at 218 and 400 C.Above 600 C the weight loss was negligible, implying the basically formed of the structure of MgFe 2 O 4 14.Notably, it can be seen clearly from partial enlargement of TG curves in Fig. 4(b) that a slight weight loss was detected in the range of 660-750 C, accompanying a weak endothermic peak, which may be related to the removal of a small amount of oxygen from the spinel structure, resulting the formation of oxygen vacancies on the surface of the sample.It can be inferred that high calcination temperature may be beneficial to form the oxygen vacancies.After that, a weight gain was found when calcination temperature was at the range of 800-850 C in Fig. 4(b).In view of the decrease of the XRD peaks for Mg-Fe-850 sample, this weight gain was likely related to the formation of iron oxide with higher valence, which was derived from the chemical reaction between MgFe 2 O 4 and oxygen at higher temperature. The XPS technique was used to probe the surface chemical composition, state of elements and valence band in Mg-Fe-650 and Mg-Fe-750 catalysts.The survey spectra (Fig. 5(a)) confirmed the presence of Mg, Fe and O elements in Mg-Fe-650 and Mg-Fe-750.high-resolution XPS spectra of Mg 1s, Fe 2p and O 1s were presented in Fig. 5(b-d).The characterized signal of Mg 1s was found at 1303.27 eV (Fig. 5(b)), corresponding to Mg 2 in MgFe 2 O 4 19; the O 1s spectrum can be divided into three peaks at 529.20 eV, 530.16 eV and 531.53 eV, which were attributed to lattice oxygen, adsorbed oxygen species and oxygen vacancies, respectively 31,383940.According to the peak area ratio of the oxygen vacancy to all oxygen species, the defective oxygen proportion of Mg-Fe-650 and Mg-Fe-750 was 21.01 and 23.92, respectively, which demonstrated that the more oxygen vacancies were formed by increasing heating temperature from 650 C to 750 C.In Fig. 5(d), the binding energies of 710.16 eV and 724.22 eV for Fe 2p 3/2 and Fe 2p 1/2 with a shake-up satellite peak at 717.97 eV were observed, representing the characteristic of Fe 3 in the hybrid 16,41.The peaks located at 709.42 eV revealed the presence of Fe 2 2p 3/2 42.Notably, Fe 3 2p 3/2 and Fe 2p 1/2 of Mg-Fe-750 obviously appeared a slight shift to higher binding energy comparing with Mg-Fe-650, indicating stronger electronic interaction in Mg-Fe-750. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR) was carried out to directly determine the existence of oxygen vacancies.As shown in Fig. 6, a significant signal was detected at g2.003 in samples calcinated at 650, 750 and 850 C.Based on previous reports, the signal peak assigned to g2.001-2.004was ascribed to electron trapped on oxygen vacancies 43,44.Therefore, abundant oxygen vacancies on the surface of MgFe 2 O 4 were successfully constructed after heating process, and the EPR results showed the concentration of oxygen vacancies increased firstly with the increase in calcination temperature, then decreased with the further increase of calcination temperature, and the Mg-Fe-750 displayed the highest EPR signal among these samples, implying higher oxygen vacancies concentration, agreement with the result of O 1s spectrum. The light absorption properties of MgFe 2 O 4 samples were investigated by an UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS).In Fig. 7(a), all samples showed excellent absorption performance in visible light region (400-650 nm), demonstrating MgFe 2 O 4 samples belonged to the narrow-band gap semiconductor materials.The intensities of light absorption for as-prepared samples increased gradually with the calcination temperature getting higher.The enhancement in light absorption with the increase of calcination temperature can be due to the formation of more spine phase and the increase of oxygen vacancies.When calcination temperature is higher than 800 C, the light absorption decreases obviously, which can be due to the destruction of spinel phase as illustrated by XRD pattern.Notably, the increase in light absorption at 600-700 nm with the increase of calcination temperature was seen, which can be caused by the electron transition from donor state, or oxygen vacancies and structure defects 45, confirming that the content of oxygen vacancies is increased.The Mg-Fe-750 and Mg-Fe-800 samples exhibited the stronger visible light absorption.It may be due to the more oxygen vacancies generated during the heating process, which was conductive to the visible light absorption of the samples.The bandgap values of MgFe 2 O 4 samples were calculated by Kubelka-Munk function 17, as shown in Fig. 7(b).For the samples Mg-Fe-T (T 650, 700, 750, 800 and 850), the band gap width was 1.99, 2.08, 2.12, 2.17 and 2.04 eV, respectively. In order to further study the band structure, the Mott-Schottky diagram (Fig. 8a) was used to evaluate the flat band potential (E FB ), carrier's concentration and semiconductor type.All curves possessed positive slope, indicating that the samples obtained were n-type semiconductors.The electrode potential was converted to the standard hydrogen electrode (NHE) potential using the following relation: The E FB of Mg-Fe-T (T 650, 700, 750, 800 and 850) were -0.17, -0.22, -0.20, -0.15 and -0.13 V (Vs.NHE), respectively.It's well known that n-type semiconductor conduction potential (E CB ) is more negative 0.1 or 0.2 V than its E FB .In this paper, -0.2 V was used to calculate the E CB .The valence band potential (E VB ) was estimated by formula (2) using the band gap values calculated in Fig. 7b and summarized in Table 2. Room temperature PL spectra were detected to investigate the separation, migration and recombination process of photogenerated All samples exhibit the emission peak at 399 nm due to the recombination photo-induced carriers.It is noted that the PL intensity decreased firstly as the increase of calcination temperature then increased and the Mg-Fe-750 sample possessed the lowest PL emission peak.This result can be ascribed to the content of oxygen vacancies.Because the existence of oxygen vacancies can promote the separation of photogenerated electron and hole pairs.It is well known that the PL peak intensity is directly proportional to the rate of the electron-hole recombination.Therefore, the Mg-Fe-750 sample may have highest photocatalytic activity as compared with other samples.The optical response and photoelectrical chemical properties of the as-prepared samples were tested by electrochemical workstation.Fig. 9(a) showed the transient photocurrent response under 10 cycles of Xeon lamp irradiation equipped with a 420 nm cutoff filter.As can be seen in Fig. 9(a), all samples displayed photocurrent response under visible light irradiation, and photocurrent firstly increased gradually, then decreased with the increase of calcination temperature, Mg-Fe-750 sample have the highest photocurrent.When calcination temperature is lower, the enhancement of photocurrent with the increase of calcination temperature could be attributed to the increase of spine phase and oxygen vacancies content, the decline of photocurrent with further increase of calcination temperature might be due to the decrease of oxygen vacancy concentration and the destruction of spinel phase.In addition, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was investigated, as shown in Fig. 9(b).The arc radius of the Nyquist curves of the Mg-Fe-750 was smallest, indicating it had lowest interfacial resistance and highest charge carrier separation efficiency at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Since the chemisorption and activation of CO 2 on the surface of photocatalysts is directly related to the activity of photocatalyst, TPD and in-situ FTIR for CO 2 chemisorption were carried out to investigate the effects of calcination temperature on the absorption properties of CO 2 on the surface of Mg-Fe-T samples.Fig. 10(a) shows the results of TPD for CO 2 adsorption on the surface of Mg-Fe-T samples.For all catalysts, one peak centered at 127 C was observed, which was attributed to the desorption of CO 2 molecule.With the increase of calcination temperature of samples, the desorption amount of CO 2 increased firstly and then decreased, demonstrating the significant influence of calcination temperature on the adsorption amount of CO 2 .Mg-Fe-750 exhibited the largest adsorption amount of CO 2 , which can be related to the highest oxygen vacancy concentrate generated from the removal of oxygen. In order to determine the species of CO 2 intermediates on the surface of photocatalysts, in situ FTIR spectra after the adsorption of CO 2 for 1 h at 100 C on the surfaces of Mg-Fe-T in the dark were performed.As shown in the Fig. 10 (b), after the adsorption of CO 2 , the bands at 1330 cm -1 attributed to the monodentate carbonate group (m-CO 3 2-) 46, at 1351 cm -1 assigned to bidentate carbonate (b-CO 3 2-) 23, at 1300 cm -1 related to the vibration of adsorbed carbonate or bicarbonate 47, and at 1250 cm -1 belonged to the COO -species 48 were detected.These results showed that the adsorption of CO 2 on the surface of Mg-Fe-T promoted the formation of m-CO 3 , b-CO 3 2-and COO -, which have been reported as the reactive adsorbed species in photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 6,47,49. Similarly, the intensity of FTIR bands increased firstly and then decreased with the increase of calcination temperature, which is mainly due to the content of oxygen vacancies. The photocatalytic performance of as-prepared samples was evaluated by photocatalytic CO 2 reduction using water as a reducing agent at 160 C under visible light irradiation.The control tests were carried out and verified that no products were produced with the absence of light or photocatalyst.Additionally, when CO 2 was replaced by N 2 , only H 2 but no carbon containing product was detected, implying that the carbon-containing product was originated from CO 2 . Besides oxygen, H 2 and CO were found to be the major CO 2 reduction products.Fig. 11(a) displayed the average production rate of H 2 and CO from CO 2 reduction with H 2 O vapor over Mg-Fe-T (T 650, 700, 750, 800 and 850) during 2 h reaction under visible light irradiation (420 nm).It can be seen clearly that calcination temperature has a significant influence on photocatalytic activity.After 2 h irradiation, CO average production rates were 4.7, 13.3, 24.4,17.8 and 9.8 mol/gcat/h, and H 2 production rates was 17.5, 23.6, 34.3, 25.4 and 19.3 mol/gcat/h for Mg-Fe-650, Mg-Fe-700, Mg-Fe-750, Mg-Fe-800 and Mg-Fe-850, respectively.Obviously, the activity of photocatalysts increases with the increase of calcination temperature and reaches maxima at 750 C.After that, the activity decreases with further increasing of calcination temperature.Mg-Fe-750 exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity of CO 2 reduction among all samples, for which H 2 and CO production rates were about 5 and 2 times that of Mg-Fe-650 calcined at lower temperature.In addition, the selectivity of photo-generated electron for CO 2 reduction was calculated to be 21.1, 36, 41.6, 41.2 and 33.7 for Mg-Fe-650, Mg-Fe-700, Mg-Fe-750, Mg-Fe-800 and Mg-Fe-850, respectively.Obviously, the Mg-Fe-750 samples possesses the highest selectivity of CO 2 reduction. The stability of the used Mg-Fe-750 sample was further evaluated by circle experiments and the results was showed in Fig. 11 (b).The activity of as-prepared Mg-Fe-750 was still satisfactory after five cycles.The CO and H 2 production rates were decreased by 35.0 and 17.5 compared to those of the fresh photocatalyst, respectively.The decrease of yield was likely due to the reduction of oxygen vacancy on the surface of photocatalyst, which was repaired by oxygen from CO 2 molecule or O 2 formed during the photocatalytic reaction.This resulted into the decrease of photo absorption capacity and separation efficiency of photogenerated electron-hole pairs of Mg-Fe-750 sample, thus decreasing the photocatalytic activity. According to EPR, XPS, UV/vis DRS, PL spectra, photocurrent measurements, CO 2 -TPD and in situ FTIR results, the improvement in photocatalytic activity of Mg-Fe-T samples calcined at high temperature should be mainly ascribed to the content of spinel phase and oxygen vacancies.Firstly, the calcination temperature influences the crystal phase composition of Mg-Fe-T samples, and the samples calcined at lower temperature (600 C and 700 C) showed the presence of Fe 2 O 3 , which decreased the content of spinel phase.Also,"}, {"llm generation": "visible light", "source": "The photocatalytic performance of as-prepared samples was evaluated by photocatalytic CO 2 reduction using water as a reducing agent at 160 C under visible light irradiation.", "context": "The XRD patterns of Mg-Fe-T samples were shown in Fig. 1.It can be seen clearly that all samples display the diffraction peaks at 2 30.2,35.5, 43.2, 53.6, 57.1 and 62.7, corresponded to (220), (311), (400), ( 422), ( 511) and (440) crystal plane of cubic MgFe 2 O 4 (JCPDS 36-0398) 34, respectively, which indicates the formation of MgFe 2 O 4 spinel phase.However, the characteristic peaks of hematite Fe 2 O 3 at the 2 33.1,40.8, 49.5 and 64.0 were detected (JCPDS 33-0664) when calcination temperature is much lower than 750 C and these peaks disappeared with the further increase of the temperature.In addition, the intensity of XRD diffraction peaks ascribed to spinel phase was getting more intense and sharper as the calcination temperature increased from 650 to 800 C, indicating that the crystallinity or particle size of MgFe 2 O 4 spinel phase increased with the increase of temperature.However, when calcination temperature reached 850 C, the XRD peak became weak compared to that of Mg-Fe-850 sample, revealing a slight destroy of spinel phase at higher temperature.The crystal size of each sample was estimated by Debye-Scherrer's formula according to their (311) planes, which are subsequently 38.1 nm, 42.7 nm, 45.6 nm, 48.5 nm and 50.3 nm, respectively, showing that the particle sizes increased gradually with the increase of temperature due to the crystal growth. FTIR spectra of MgFe 2 O 4 ferrite prepared at different calcinated temperature were shown in Fig. 1(b).For precursor, a weak peak around 1385 cm -1 was assigned to the vibration of nitrate 35, which may be due to the presence of residual inorganic salts in the samples.No characteristic peak of spinel was found in the precursor, indicating the spinel structure was formed after calcination.In Mg-Fe-T samples, the characteristic bands at 430 cm -1 and 551 cm -1 attributed to the stretching vibration of metal-oxygen bond at octahedral and tetrahedron, and the high frequency bands around 1000 cm -1 ascribed to stretching intrinsic vibration of unit cell of spinel in tetrahedral sites 36 were observed, confirming the formation of cubic spinel structure 37.As the calcination temperature raised, the FTIR bands became strong, and then weakened when temperature is high than 800 C, which was consistence with XRD patterns.

The pore structure and size distribution of as-prepared samples were studied by N 2 adsorption/desorption.Obviously, the hysteresis loops in adsorption isotherm could be seen in the Fig. 3, revealing its characteristics of mesoporous, the area of the hysteresis loop and adsorption volume decreased gradually with the increase of calcination temperature, indicating the reduction of mesopore number and surface area.The BET specific surface areas, average pore diameters, and pore volumes of samples are listed in Table 1.Obviously, as the calcination temperature raised, the BET surface area, total porous volume decreased gradually, which confirmed that the pore structure reduced with the increase of calcination temperature.Notably, the average pore sizes of samples have little change with the increase of calcination temperature, indicating the simultaneous decrease in the amount of small pore and large pore. The formation of MgFe 2 O 4 during the heating process was further explored by the thermogravimetric analysis (Fig. 4(a)).The first weight loss with a prominent endothermic phenomenon was obtained in the region of 30-200 C, corresponding to the loss of water.The decomposition of the metal hydroxides and nitrate complexes occurred between 80 and 325 C, following with two endothermic peaks at 218 and 400 C.Above 600 C the weight loss was negligible, implying the basically formed of the structure of MgFe 2 O 4 14.Notably, it can be seen clearly from partial enlargement of TG curves in Fig. 4(b) that a slight weight loss was detected in the range of 660-750 C, accompanying a weak endothermic peak, which may be related to the removal of a small amount of oxygen from the spinel structure, resulting the formation of oxygen vacancies on the surface of the sample.It can be inferred that high calcination temperature may be beneficial to form the oxygen vacancies.After that, a weight gain was found when calcination temperature was at the range of 800-850 C in Fig. 4(b).In view of the decrease of the XRD peaks for Mg-Fe-850 sample, this weight gain was likely related to the formation of iron oxide with higher valence, which was derived from the chemical reaction between MgFe 2 O 4 and oxygen at higher temperature. The XPS technique was used to probe the surface chemical composition, state of elements and valence band in Mg-Fe-650 and Mg-Fe-750 catalysts.The survey spectra (Fig. 5(a)) confirmed the presence of Mg, Fe and O elements in Mg-Fe-650 and Mg-Fe-750.high-resolution XPS spectra of Mg 1s, Fe 2p and O 1s were presented in Fig. 5(b-d).The characterized signal of Mg 1s was found at 1303.27 eV (Fig. 5(b)), corresponding to Mg 2 in MgFe 2 O 4 19; the O 1s spectrum can be divided into three peaks at 529.20 eV, 530.16 eV and 531.53 eV, which were attributed to lattice oxygen, adsorbed oxygen species and oxygen vacancies, respectively 31,383940.According to the peak area ratio of the oxygen vacancy to all oxygen species, the defective oxygen proportion of Mg-Fe-650 and Mg-Fe-750 was 21.01 and 23.92, respectively, which demonstrated that the more oxygen vacancies were formed by increasing heating temperature from 650 C to 750 C.In Fig. 5(d), the binding energies of 710.16 eV and 724.22 eV for Fe 2p 3/2 and Fe 2p 1/2 with a shake-up satellite peak at 717.97 eV were observed, representing the characteristic of Fe 3 in the hybrid 16,41.The peaks located at 709.42 eV revealed the presence of Fe 2 2p 3/2 42.Notably, Fe 3 2p 3/2 and Fe 2p 1/2 of Mg-Fe-750 obviously appeared a slight shift to higher binding energy comparing with Mg-Fe-650, indicating stronger electronic interaction in Mg-Fe-750. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR) was carried out to directly determine the existence of oxygen vacancies.As shown in Fig. 6, a significant signal was detected at g2.003 in samples calcinated at 650, 750 and 850 C.Based on previous reports, the signal peak assigned to g2.001-2.004was ascribed to electron trapped on oxygen vacancies 43,44.Therefore, abundant oxygen vacancies on the surface of MgFe 2 O 4 were successfully constructed after heating process, and the EPR results showed the concentration of oxygen vacancies increased firstly with the increase in calcination temperature, then decreased with the further increase of calcination temperature, and the Mg-Fe-750 displayed the highest EPR signal among these samples, implying higher oxygen vacancies concentration, agreement with the result of O 1s spectrum. The light absorption properties of MgFe 2 O 4 samples were investigated by an UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS).In Fig. 7(a), all samples showed excellent absorption performance in visible light region (400-650 nm), demonstrating MgFe 2 O 4 samples belonged to the narrow-band gap semiconductor materials.The intensities of light absorption for as-prepared samples increased gradually with the calcination temperature getting higher.The enhancement in light absorption with the increase of calcination temperature can be due to the formation of more spine phase and the increase of oxygen vacancies.When calcination temperature is higher than 800 C, the light absorption decreases obviously, which can be due to the destruction of spinel phase as illustrated by XRD pattern.Notably, the increase in light absorption at 600-700 nm with the increase of calcination temperature was seen, which can be caused by the electron transition from donor state, or oxygen vacancies and structure defects 45, confirming that the content of oxygen vacancies is increased.The Mg-Fe-750 and Mg-Fe-800 samples exhibited the stronger visible light absorption.It may be due to the more oxygen vacancies generated during the heating process, which was conductive to the visible light absorption of the samples.The bandgap values of MgFe 2 O 4 samples were calculated by Kubelka-Munk function 17, as shown in Fig. 7(b).For the samples Mg-Fe-T (T 650, 700, 750, 800 and 850), the band gap width was 1.99, 2.08, 2.12, 2.17 and 2.04 eV, respectively. In order to further study the band structure, the Mott-Schottky diagram (Fig. 8a) was used to evaluate the flat band potential (E FB ), carrier's concentration and semiconductor type.All curves possessed positive slope, indicating that the samples obtained were n-type semiconductors.The electrode potential was converted to the standard hydrogen electrode (NHE) potential using the following relation: The E FB of Mg-Fe-T (T 650, 700, 750, 800 and 850) were -0.17, -0.22, -0.20, -0.15 and -0.13 V (Vs.NHE), respectively.It's well known that n-type semiconductor conduction potential (E CB ) is more negative 0.1 or 0.2 V than its E FB .In this paper, -0.2 V was used to calculate the E CB .The valence band potential (E VB ) was estimated by formula (2) using the band gap values calculated in Fig. 7b and summarized in Table 2. Room temperature PL spectra were detected to investigate the separation, migration and recombination process of photogenerated All samples exhibit the emission peak at 399 nm due to the recombination photo-induced carriers.It is noted that the PL intensity decreased firstly as the increase of calcination temperature then increased and the Mg-Fe-750 sample possessed the lowest PL emission peak.This result can be ascribed to the content of oxygen vacancies.Because the existence of oxygen vacancies can promote the separation of photogenerated electron and hole pairs.It is well known that the PL peak intensity is directly proportional to the rate of the electron-hole recombination.Therefore, the Mg-Fe-750 sample may have highest photocatalytic activity as compared with other samples.The optical response and photoelectrical chemical properties of the as-prepared samples were tested by electrochemical workstation.Fig. 9(a) showed the transient photocurrent response under 10 cycles of Xeon lamp irradiation equipped with a 420 nm cutoff filter.As can be seen in Fig. 9(a), all samples displayed photocurrent response under visible light irradiation, and photocurrent firstly increased gradually, then decreased with the increase of calcination temperature, Mg-Fe-750 sample have the highest photocurrent.When calcination temperature is lower, the enhancement of photocurrent with the increase of calcination temperature could be attributed to the increase of spine phase and oxygen vacancies content, the decline of photocurrent with further increase of calcination temperature might be due to the decrease of oxygen vacancy concentration and the destruction of spinel phase.In addition, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was investigated, as shown in Fig. 9(b).The arc radius of the Nyquist curves of the Mg-Fe-750 was smallest, indicating it had lowest interfacial resistance and highest charge carrier separation efficiency at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Since the chemisorption and activation of CO 2 on the surface of photocatalysts is directly related to the activity of photocatalyst, TPD and in-situ FTIR for CO 2 chemisorption were carried out to investigate the effects of calcination temperature on the absorption properties of CO 2 on the surface of Mg-Fe-T samples.Fig. 10(a) shows the results of TPD for CO 2 adsorption on the surface of Mg-Fe-T samples.For all catalysts, one peak centered at 127 C was observed, which was attributed to the desorption of CO 2 molecule.With the increase of calcination temperature of samples, the desorption amount of CO 2 increased firstly and then decreased, demonstrating the significant influence of calcination temperature on the adsorption amount of CO 2 .Mg-Fe-750 exhibited the largest adsorption amount of CO 2 , which can be related to the highest oxygen vacancy concentrate generated from the removal of oxygen. In order to determine the species of CO 2 intermediates on the surface of photocatalysts, in situ FTIR spectra after the adsorption of CO 2 for 1 h at 100 C on the surfaces of Mg-Fe-T in the dark were performed.As shown in the Fig. 10 (b), after the adsorption of CO 2 , the bands at 1330 cm -1 attributed to the monodentate carbonate group (m-CO 3 2-) 46, at 1351 cm -1 assigned to bidentate carbonate (b-CO 3 2-) 23, at 1300 cm -1 related to the vibration of adsorbed carbonate or bicarbonate 47, and at 1250 cm -1 belonged to the COO -species 48 were detected.These results showed that the adsorption of CO 2 on the surface of Mg-Fe-T promoted the formation of m-CO 3 , b-CO 3 2-and COO -, which have been reported as the reactive adsorbed species in photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 6,47,49. Similarly, the intensity of FTIR bands increased firstly and then decreased with the increase of calcination temperature, which is mainly due to the content of oxygen vacancies. The photocatalytic performance of as-prepared samples was evaluated by photocatalytic CO 2 reduction using water as a reducing agent at 160 C under visible light irradiation.The control tests were carried out and verified that no products were produced with the absence of light or photocatalyst.Additionally, when CO 2 was replaced by N 2 , only H 2 but no carbon containing product was detected, implying that the carbon-containing product was originated from CO 2 . Besides oxygen, H 2 and CO were found to be the major CO 2 reduction products.Fig. 11(a) displayed the average production rate of H 2 and CO from CO 2 reduction with H 2 O vapor over Mg-Fe-T (T 650, 700, 750, 800 and 850) during 2 h reaction under visible light irradiation (420 nm).It can be seen clearly that calcination temperature has a significant influence on photocatalytic activity.After 2 h irradiation, CO average production rates were 4.7, 13.3, 24.4,17.8 and 9.8 mol/gcat/h, and H 2 production rates was 17.5, 23.6, 34.3, 25.4 and 19.3 mol/gcat/h for Mg-Fe-650, Mg-Fe-700, Mg-Fe-750, Mg-Fe-800 and Mg-Fe-850, respectively.Obviously, the activity of photocatalysts increases with the increase of calcination temperature and reaches maxima at 750 C.After that, the activity decreases with further increasing of calcination temperature.Mg-Fe-750 exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity of CO 2 reduction among all samples, for which H 2 and CO production rates were about 5 and 2 times that of Mg-Fe-650 calcined at lower temperature.In addition, the selectivity of photo-generated electron for CO 2 reduction was calculated to be 21.1, 36, 41.6, 41.2 and 33.7 for Mg-Fe-650, Mg-Fe-700, Mg-Fe-750, Mg-Fe-800 and Mg-Fe-850, respectively.Obviously, the Mg-Fe-750 samples possesses the highest selectivity of CO 2 reduction. The stability of the used Mg-Fe-750 sample was further evaluated by circle experiments and the results was showed in Fig. 11 (b).The activity of as-prepared Mg-Fe-750 was still satisfactory after five cycles.The CO and H 2 production rates were decreased by 35.0 and 17.5 compared to those of the fresh photocatalyst, respectively.The decrease of yield was likely due to the reduction of oxygen vacancy on the surface of photocatalyst, which was repaired by oxygen from CO 2 molecule or O 2 formed during the photocatalytic reaction.This resulted into the decrease of photo absorption capacity and separation efficiency of photogenerated electron-hole pairs of Mg-Fe-750 sample, thus decreasing the photocatalytic activity. According to EPR, XPS, UV/vis DRS, PL spectra, photocurrent measurements, CO 2 -TPD and in situ FTIR results, the improvement in photocatalytic activity of Mg-Fe-T samples calcined at high temperature should be mainly ascribed to the content of spinel phase and oxygen vacancies.Firstly, the calcination temperature influences the crystal phase composition of Mg-Fe-T samples, and the samples calcined at lower temperature (600 C and 700 C) showed the presence of Fe 2 O 3 , which decreased the content of spinel phase.Also,"}, {"llm generation": "visible light (420 nm)", "source": "Fig. 11(a) displayed the average production rate of H 2 and CO from CO 2 reduction with H 2 O vapor over Mg-Fe-T (T 650, 700, 750, 800 and 850) during 2 h reaction under visible light irradiation (420 nm).", "context": "The XRD patterns of Mg-Fe-T samples were shown in Fig. 1.It can be seen clearly that all samples display the diffraction peaks at 2 30.2,35.5, 43.2, 53.6, 57.1 and 62.7, corresponded to (220), (311), (400), ( 422), ( 511) and (440) crystal plane of cubic MgFe 2 O 4 (JCPDS 36-0398) 34, respectively, which indicates the formation of MgFe 2 O 4 spinel phase.However, the characteristic peaks of hematite Fe 2 O 3 at the 2 33.1,40.8, 49.5 and 64.0 were detected (JCPDS 33-0664) when calcination temperature is much lower than 750 C and these peaks disappeared with the further increase of the temperature.In addition, the intensity of XRD diffraction peaks ascribed to spinel phase was getting more intense and sharper as the calcination temperature increased from 650 to 800 C, indicating that the crystallinity or particle size of MgFe 2 O 4 spinel phase increased with the increase of temperature.However, when calcination temperature reached 850 C, the XRD peak became weak compared to that of Mg-Fe-850 sample, revealing a slight destroy of spinel phase at higher temperature.The crystal size of each sample was estimated by Debye-Scherrer's formula according to their (311) planes, which are subsequently 38.1 nm, 42.7 nm, 45.6 nm, 48.5 nm and 50.3 nm, respectively, showing that the particle sizes increased gradually with the increase of temperature due to the crystal growth. FTIR spectra of MgFe 2 O 4 ferrite prepared at different calcinated temperature were shown in Fig. 1(b).For precursor, a weak peak around 1385 cm -1 was assigned to the vibration of nitrate 35, which may be due to the presence of residual inorganic salts in the samples.No characteristic peak of spinel was found in the precursor, indicating the spinel structure was formed after calcination.In Mg-Fe-T samples, the characteristic bands at 430 cm -1 and 551 cm -1 attributed to the stretching vibration of metal-oxygen bond at octahedral and tetrahedron, and the high frequency bands around 1000 cm -1 ascribed to stretching intrinsic vibration of unit cell of spinel in tetrahedral sites 36 were observed, confirming the formation of cubic spinel structure 37.As the calcination temperature raised, the FTIR bands became strong, and then weakened when temperature is high than 800 C, which was consistence with XRD patterns. The morphology of the samples was analyzed in detail using the TEM images.As shown in Fig. 2, all MgFe 2 O 4 samples prepared by coprecipitation exhibited particle morphology, and some particles aggregated into layer due to the magnetic force of ferrite 23.With the increase of calcination temperature, the morphology of the samples was transformed gradually to cube structure, and the particle sizes of Mg-Fe-T have a slight increase with the increase of calcination temperature.The lattice fringes with the lattice spacing about 0.26 nm, contributed to the (311) crystal facet of cubic MgFe 2 O 4 , was clearly observed from the HR-TEM images (h), which verified the successful synthesis of spinel crystal. The pore structure and size distribution of as-prepared samples were studied by N 2 adsorption/desorption.Obviously, the hysteresis loops in adsorption isotherm could be seen in the Fig. 3, revealing its characteristics of mesoporous, the area of the hysteresis loop and adsorption volume decreased gradually with the increase of calcination temperature, indicating the reduction of mesopore number and surface area.The BET specific surface areas, average pore diameters, and pore volumes of samples are listed in Table 1.Obviously, as the calcination temperature raised, the BET surface area, total porous volume decreased gradually, which confirmed that the pore structure reduced with the increase of calcination temperature.Notably, the average pore sizes of samples have little change with the increase of calcination temperature, indicating the simultaneous decrease in the amount of small pore and large pore. The formation of MgFe 2 O 4 during the heating process was further explored by the thermogravimetric analysis (Fig. 4(a)).The first weight loss with a prominent endothermic phenomenon was obtained in the region of 30-200 C, corresponding to the loss of water.The decomposition of the metal hydroxides and nitrate complexes occurred between 80 and 325 C, following with two endothermic peaks at 218 and 400 C.Above 600 C the weight loss was negligible, implying the basically formed of the structure of MgFe 2 O 4 14.Notably, it can be seen clearly from partial enlargement of TG curves in Fig. 4(b) that a slight weight loss was detected in the range of 660-750 C, accompanying a weak endothermic peak, which may be related to the removal of a small amount of oxygen from the spinel structure, resulting the formation of oxygen vacancies on the surface of the sample.It can be inferred that high calcination temperature may be beneficial to form the oxygen vacancies.After that, a weight gain was found when calcination temperature was at the range of 800-850 C in Fig. 4(b).In view of the decrease of the XRD peaks for Mg-Fe-850 sample, this weight gain was likely related to the formation of iron oxide with higher valence, which was derived from the chemical reaction between MgFe 2 O 4 and oxygen at higher temperature. The XPS technique was used to probe the surface chemical composition, state of elements and valence band in Mg-Fe-650 and Mg-Fe-750 catalysts.The survey spectra (Fig. 5(a)) confirmed the presence of Mg, Fe and O elements in Mg-Fe-650 and Mg-Fe-750.high-resolution XPS spectra of Mg 1s, Fe 2p and O 1s were presented in Fig. 5(b-d).The characterized signal of Mg 1s was found at 1303.27 eV (Fig. 5(b)), corresponding to Mg 2 in MgFe 2 O 4 19; the O 1s spectrum can be divided into three peaks at 529.20 eV, 530.16 eV and 531.53 eV, which were attributed to lattice oxygen, adsorbed oxygen species and oxygen vacancies, respectively 31,383940.According to the peak area ratio of the oxygen vacancy to all oxygen species, the defective oxygen proportion of Mg-Fe-650 and Mg-Fe-750 was 21.01 and 23.92, respectively, which demonstrated that the more oxygen vacancies were formed by increasing heating temperature from 650 C to 750 C.In Fig. 5(d), the binding energies of 710.16 eV and 724.22 eV for Fe 2p 3/2 and Fe 2p 1/2 with a shake-up satellite peak at 717.97 eV were observed, representing the characteristic of Fe 3 in the hybrid 16,41.The peaks located at 709.42 eV revealed the presence of Fe 2 2p 3/2 42.Notably, Fe 3 2p 3/2 and Fe 2p 1/2 of Mg-Fe-750 obviously appeared a slight shift to higher binding energy comparing with Mg-Fe-650, indicating stronger electronic interaction in Mg-Fe-750. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR) was carried out to directly determine the existence of oxygen vacancies.As shown in Fig. 6, a significant signal was detected at g2.003 in samples calcinated at 650, 750 and 850 C.Based on previous reports, the signal peak assigned to g2.001-2.004was ascribed to electron trapped on oxygen vacancies 43,44.Therefore, abundant oxygen vacancies on the surface of MgFe 2 O 4 were successfully constructed after heating process, and the EPR results showed the concentration of oxygen vacancies increased firstly with the increase in calcination temperature, then decreased with the further increase of calcination temperature, and the Mg-Fe-750 displayed the highest EPR signal among these samples, implying higher oxygen vacancies concentration, agreement with the result of O 1s spectrum. The light absorption properties of MgFe 2 O 4 samples were investigated by an UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS).In Fig. 7(a), all samples showed excellent absorption performance in visible light region (400-650 nm), demonstrating MgFe 2 O 4 samples belonged to the narrow-band gap semiconductor materials.The intensities of light absorption for as-prepared samples increased gradually with the calcination temperature getting higher.The enhancement in light absorption with the increase of calcination temperature can be due to the formation of more spine phase and the increase of oxygen vacancies.When calcination temperature is higher than 800 C, the light absorption decreases obviously, which can be due to the destruction of spinel phase as illustrated by XRD pattern.Notably, the increase in light absorption at 600-700 nm with the increase of calcination temperature was seen, which can be caused by the electron transition from donor state, or oxygen vacancies and structure defects 45, confirming that the content of oxygen vacancies is increased.The Mg-Fe-750 and Mg-Fe-800 samples exhibited the stronger visible light absorption.It may be due to the more oxygen vacancies generated during the heating process, which was conductive to the visible light absorption of the samples.The bandgap values of MgFe 2 O 4 samples were calculated by Kubelka-Munk function 17, as shown in Fig. 7(b).For the samples Mg-Fe-T (T 650, 700, 750, 800 and 850), the band gap width was 1.99, 2.08, 2.12, 2.17 and 2.04 eV, respectively. In order to further study the band structure, the Mott-Schottky diagram (Fig. 8a) was used to evaluate the flat band potential (E FB ), carrier's concentration and semiconductor type.All curves possessed positive slope, indicating that the samples obtained were n-type semiconductors.The electrode potential was converted to the standard hydrogen electrode (NHE) potential using the following relation: The E FB of Mg-Fe-T (T 650, 700, 750, 800 and 850) were -0.17, -0.22, -0.20, -0.15 and -0.13 V (Vs.NHE), respectively.It's well known that n-type semiconductor conduction potential (E CB ) is more negative 0.1 or 0.2 V than its E FB .In this paper, -0.2 V was used to calculate the E CB .The valence band potential (E VB ) was estimated by formula (2) using the band gap values calculated in Fig. 7b and summarized in Table 2. Room temperature PL spectra were detected to investigate the separation, migration and recombination process of photogenerated All samples exhibit the emission peak at 399 nm due to the recombination photo-induced carriers.It is noted that the PL intensity decreased firstly as the increase of calcination temperature then increased and the Mg-Fe-750 sample possessed the lowest PL emission peak.This result can be ascribed to the content of oxygen vacancies.Because the existence of oxygen vacancies can promote the separation of photogenerated electron and hole pairs.It is well known that the PL peak intensity is directly proportional to the rate of the electron-hole recombination.Therefore, the Mg-Fe-750 sample may have highest photocatalytic activity as compared with other samples.The optical response and photoelectrical chemical properties of the as-prepared samples were tested by electrochemical workstation.Fig. 9(a) showed the transient photocurrent response under 10 cycles of Xeon lamp irradiation equipped with a 420 nm cutoff filter.As can be seen in Fig. 9(a), all samples displayed photocurrent response under visible light irradiation, and photocurrent firstly increased gradually, then decreased with the increase of calcination temperature, Mg-Fe-750 sample have the highest photocurrent.When calcination temperature is lower, the enhancement of photocurrent with the increase of calcination temperature could be attributed to the increase of spine phase and oxygen vacancies content, the decline of photocurrent with further increase of calcination temperature might be due to the decrease of oxygen vacancy concentration and the destruction of spinel phase.In addition, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was investigated, as shown in Fig. 9(b).The arc radius of the Nyquist curves of the Mg-Fe-750 was smallest, indicating it had lowest interfacial resistance and highest charge carrier separation efficiency at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Since the chemisorption and activation of CO 2 on the surface of photocatalysts is directly related to the activity of photocatalyst, TPD and in-situ FTIR for CO 2 chemisorption were carried out to investigate the effects of calcination temperature on the absorption properties of CO 2 on the surface of Mg-Fe-T samples.Fig. 10(a) shows the results of TPD for CO 2 adsorption on the surface of Mg-Fe-T samples.For all catalysts, one peak centered at 127 C was observed, which was attributed to the desorption of CO 2 molecule.With the increase of calcination temperature of samples, the desorption amount of CO 2 increased firstly and then decreased, demonstrating the significant influence of calcination temperature on the adsorption amount of CO 2 .Mg-Fe-750 exhibited the largest adsorption amount of CO 2 , which can be related to the highest oxygen vacancy concentrate generated from the removal of oxygen. In order to determine the species of CO 2 intermediates on the surface of photocatalysts, in situ FTIR spectra after the adsorption of CO 2 for 1 h at 100 C on the surfaces of Mg-Fe-T in the dark were performed.As shown in the Fig. 10 (b), after the adsorption of CO 2 , the bands at 1330 cm -1 attributed to the monodentate carbonate group (m-CO 3 2-) 46, at 1351 cm -1 assigned to bidentate carbonate (b-CO 3 2-) 23, at 1300 cm -1 related to the vibration of adsorbed carbonate or bicarbonate 47, and at 1250 cm -1 belonged to the COO -species 48 were detected.These results showed that the adsorption of CO 2 on the surface of Mg-Fe-T promoted the formation of m-CO 3 , b-CO 3 2-and COO -, which have been reported as the reactive adsorbed species in photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 6,47,49. Similarly, the intensity of FTIR bands increased firstly and then decreased with the increase of calcination temperature, which is mainly due to the content of oxygen vacancies. The photocatalytic performance of as-prepared samples was evaluated by photocatalytic CO 2 reduction using water as a reducing agent at 160 C under visible light irradiation.The control tests were carried out and verified that no products were produced with the absence of light or photocatalyst.Additionally, when CO 2 was replaced by N 2 , only H 2 but no carbon containing product was detected, implying that the carbon-containing product was originated from CO 2 . Besides oxygen, H 2 and CO were found to be the major CO 2 reduction products.Fig. 11(a) displayed the average production rate of H 2 and CO from CO 2 reduction with H 2 O vapor over Mg-Fe-T (T 650, 700, 750, 800 and 850) during 2 h reaction under visible light irradiation (420 nm).It can be seen clearly that calcination temperature has a significant influence on photocatalytic activity.After 2 h irradiation, CO average production rates were 4.7, 13.3, 24.4,17.8 and 9.8 mol/gcat/h, and H 2 production rates was 17.5, 23.6, 34.3, 25.4 and 19.3 mol/gcat/h for Mg-Fe-650, Mg-Fe-700, Mg-Fe-750, Mg-Fe-800 and Mg-Fe-850, respectively.Obviously, the activity of photocatalysts increases with the increase of calcination temperature and reaches maxima at 750 C.After that, the activity decreases with further increasing of calcination temperature.Mg-Fe-750 exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity of CO 2 reduction among all samples, for which H 2 and CO production rates were about 5 and 2 times that of Mg-Fe-650 calcined at lower temperature.In addition, the selectivity of photo-generated electron for CO 2 reduction was calculated to be 21.1, 36, 41.6, 41.2 and 33.7 for Mg-Fe-650, Mg-Fe-700, Mg-Fe-750, Mg-Fe-800 and Mg-Fe-850, respectively.Obviously, the Mg-Fe-750 samples possesses the highest selectivity of CO 2 reduction. The stability of the used Mg-Fe-750 sample was further evaluated by circle experiments and the results was showed in Fig. 11 (b).The activity of as-prepared Mg-Fe-750 was still satisfactory after five cycles.The CO and H 2 production rates were decreased by 35.0 and 17.5 compared to those of the fresh photocatalyst, respectively.The decrease of yield was likely due to the reduction of oxygen vacancy on the surface of photocatalyst, which was repaired by oxygen from CO 2 molecule or O 2 formed during the photocatalytic reaction.This resulted into the decrease of photo absorption capacity and separation efficiency of photogenerated electron-hole pairs of Mg-Fe-750 sample, thus decreasing the photocatalytic activity. According to EPR, XPS, UV/vis DRS, PL spectra, photocurrent measurements, CO 2 -TPD and in situ FTIR results, the improvement in photocatalytic activity of Mg-Fe-T samples calcined at high temperature should be mainly ascribed to the content of spinel phase and oxygen vacancies.Firstly, the calcination temperature influences the crystal phase composition of Mg-Fe-T samples, and the samples calcined at lower temperature (600 C and 700 C) showed the presence of Fe 2 O 3 , which decreased the content of spinel phase.Also,"}, {"llm generation": "UV-Vis", "source": "Fig. 7.

The morphologies of photocatalysts were captured by a HITACHI JEOL-2100F transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and more details were further obtained by higher magnification transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) at 200 kV accelerating voltage.The structure and crystalline size were detected by an X-ray diffractometer (Bruker D8-Focus, Cu-K, 0.15418 nm, 40 kV, 200 mA).The patterns were examined in the 2 range of 10-90 and scanning rate was 10/min.Thermogravimetric analysis was operated under air atmosphere at 5 C/min in the range of room temperature to 900 C.Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms were measured using an American Quantachrome Autosorb analyzer at -196 C.Prior to the analysis, all of the samples were vacuumed at 200 C for 6 h.The surface area and pore volume were calculated using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method.The valence states of elements were obtained by an X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).The oxygen vacancies were determined by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR) with a Brook a300. UV-vis diffuse spectra (DRS) were characterized by an UV-vis spectrometer (PerkinElmer, Lambda 750) to judge the visible light absorption capacity of the photocatalysts.The scanning range was 200-800 nm and BaSO 4 was used as the background.Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were tested via a Fluorolog three photoluminescence spectrometer (Horiba Jobin Yvon, Japan).The excitation wavelength was 280 nm, the scanning wavelength range was 300-750 nm, and the slit width was 1 nm.Photoelectrochemical measurements were performed using an electrochemical workstation (CHI-650E, Chenhua Company, Shanghai, China) with a three-electrode system.The test was conducted at room temperature using 0.1 mol/L Na 2 SO 4 as electrolyte solution.The as-prepared samples electrodes on the ITO glass were served as the working electrode.The Ag/AgCl electrode acted as the reference electrode and platinum sheet worked as the counter electrode, respectively. The CO 2 chemical adsorption ability of as-prepared samples was evaluated by temperature programmed desorption (TPD-CO 2 ).0.3 g catalyst samples were filled in a quartz tube and purged with nitrogen at 773 K for 2 h.After the reactor was cooled to a specific temperature, the CO 2 was introduced in the way of pulse to achieve a saturation chemisorption.Following, the samples was purged with He gas to the equilibrium, and the temperature was increased to 500 C at the rate of 5 C/min.The desorbed products were measured by TCD detector. The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction experiment was carried out in a homemade stainless vessel reactor with H 2 O vapor under visible light irradiation ( 420 nm).Before the catalytic reaction, and the trace impurities in CO 2 (CO and O 2 ) was removed by Cu and CuO at 650 C.50 mg catalyst powder was evenly dispersed in the reactor tray.Prior to light irradiation, the reactor was rinsed with CO 2 (30 mL/min) for 1 h at 160 C to remove the air in the reactor and the organic substances adsorbed on the catalyst surface.Then, all the valves of the reactor were closed to form a sealed system.0.3 mL deionized water was injected into reactor.Subsequently, the 300 W xenon lamp (PLS-SXE 300C xenon lamp) equipped with a 420 nm cutoff filter was used as the simulated light source.After irradiated at 160 C for 2 h, the products were analyzed by an on-line gas chromatography using a thermal conductivity detector (Agilent 4890, nitrogen as carrier gas)."}], "reaction medium": [{"llm generation": "Gas", "source": "MgFe 2 O 4 spinel with abundant oxygen vacancy was synthesized by a simple precipitation method, and tested in photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with water vapor as reductant.", "context": "MgFe 2 O 4 spinel with abundant oxygen vacancy was synthesized by a simple precipitation method, and tested in photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with water vapor as reductant.A series of characterization including XRD, XPS, EPR, PL spectrum, UV-vis DRS and TPD-CO 2 were performed to investigate the influence of calcination temperature on morphology, optical and electronic properties of MgFe 2 O 4 spinel.The results demonstrated that the oxygen vacancy concentration increases first and then decreases with the increase of calcination temperature.By introducing oxygen vacancies, the recombination of photogenerated electronhole pairs was significantly suppressed, visible light absorption and chemisorption capacity of CO 2 were dramatically boosted.Mg-Fe-750 with the richest oxygen vacancies exhibits the highest photocatalytic activity, for which the production rate of CO and H 2 was 24.4 and 34.3 mol/gcat/h, respectively."}, {"llm generation": "Gas (H2O vapor)", "source": "Fig. 11(a) displayed the average production rate of H 2 and CO from CO 2 reduction with H 2 O vapor over Mg-Fe-T (T 650, 700, 750, 800 and 850) during 2 h reaction under visible light irradiation (420 nm).", "context": "The XRD patterns of Mg-Fe-T samples were shown in Fig. 1.It can be seen clearly that all samples display the diffraction peaks at 2 30.2,35.5, 43.2, 53.6, 57.1 and 62.7, corresponded to (220), (311), (400), ( 422), ( 511) and (440) crystal plane of cubic MgFe 2 O 4 (JCPDS 36-0398) 34, respectively, which indicates the formation of MgFe 2 O 4 spinel phase.However, the characteristic peaks of hematite Fe 2 O 3 at the 2 33.1,40.8, 49.5 and 64.0 were detected (JCPDS 33-0664) when calcination temperature is much lower than 750 C and these peaks disappeared with the further increase of the temperature.In addition, the intensity of XRD diffraction peaks ascribed to spinel phase was getting more intense and sharper as the calcination temperature increased from 650 to 800 C, indicating that the crystallinity or particle size of MgFe 2 O 4 spinel phase increased with the increase of temperature.However, when calcination temperature reached 850 C, the XRD peak became weak compared to that of Mg-Fe-850 sample, revealing a slight destroy of spinel phase at higher temperature.The crystal size of each sample was estimated by Debye-Scherrer's formula according to their (311) planes, which are subsequently 38.1 nm, 42.7 nm, 45.6 nm, 48.5 nm and 50.3 nm, respectively, showing that the particle sizes increased gradually with the increase of temperature due to the crystal growth. FTIR spectra of MgFe 2 O 4 ferrite prepared at different calcinated temperature were shown in Fig. 1(b).For precursor, a weak peak around 1385 cm -1 was assigned to the vibration of nitrate 35, which may be due to the presence of residual inorganic salts in the samples.No characteristic peak of spinel was found in the precursor, indicating the spinel structure was formed after calcination.In Mg-Fe-T samples, the characteristic bands at 430 cm -1 and 551 cm -1 attributed to the stretching vibration of metal-oxygen bond at octahedral and tetrahedron, and the high frequency bands around 1000 cm -1 ascribed to stretching intrinsic vibration of unit cell of spinel in tetrahedral sites 36 were observed, confirming the formation of cubic spinel structure 37.As the calcination temperature raised, the FTIR bands became strong, and then weakened when temperature is high than 800 C, which was consistence with XRD patterns. The morphology of the samples was analyzed in detail using the TEM images.As shown in Fig. 2, all MgFe 2 O 4 samples prepared by coprecipitation exhibited particle morphology, and some particles aggregated into layer due to the magnetic force of ferrite 23.With the increase of calcination temperature, the morphology of the samples was transformed gradually to cube structure, and the particle sizes of Mg-Fe-T have a slight increase with the increase of calcination temperature.The lattice fringes with the lattice spacing about 0.26 nm, contributed to the (311) crystal facet of cubic MgFe 2 O 4 , was clearly observed from the HR-TEM images (h), which verified the successful synthesis of spinel crystal. The pore structure and size distribution of as-prepared samples were studied by N 2 adsorption/desorption.Obviously, the hysteresis loops in adsorption isotherm could be seen in the Fig. 3, revealing its characteristics of mesoporous, the area of the hysteresis loop and adsorption volume decreased gradually with the increase of calcination temperature, indicating the reduction of mesopore number and surface area.The BET specific surface areas, average pore diameters, and pore volumes of samples are listed in Table 1.Obviously, as the calcination temperature raised, the BET surface area, total porous volume decreased gradually, which confirmed that the pore structure reduced with the increase of calcination temperature.Notably, the average pore sizes of samples have little change with the increase of calcination temperature, indicating the simultaneous decrease in the amount of small pore and large pore. The formation of MgFe 2 O 4 during the heating process was further explored by the thermogravimetric analysis (Fig. 4(a)).The first weight loss with a prominent endothermic phenomenon was obtained in the region of 30-200 C, corresponding to the loss of water.The decomposition of the metal hydroxides and nitrate complexes occurred between 80 and 325 C, following with two endothermic peaks at 218 and 400 C.Above 600 C the weight loss was negligible, implying the basically formed of the structure of MgFe 2 O 4 14.Notably, it can be seen clearly from partial enlargement of TG curves in Fig. 4(b) that a slight weight loss was detected in the range of 660-750 C, accompanying a weak endothermic peak, which may be related to the removal of a small amount of oxygen from the spinel structure, resulting the formation of oxygen vacancies on the surface of the sample.It can be inferred that high calcination temperature may be beneficial to form the oxygen vacancies.After that, a weight gain was found when calcination temperature was at the range of 800-850 C in Fig. 4(b).In view of the decrease of the XRD peaks for Mg-Fe-850 sample, this weight gain was likely related to the formation of iron oxide with higher valence, which was derived from the chemical reaction between MgFe 2 O 4 and oxygen at higher temperature. The XPS technique was used to probe the surface chemical composition, state of elements and valence band in Mg-Fe-650 and Mg-Fe-750 catalysts.The survey spectra (Fig. 5(a)) confirmed the presence of Mg, Fe and O elements in Mg-Fe-650 and Mg-Fe-750.high-resolution XPS spectra of Mg 1s, Fe 2p and O 1s were presented in Fig. 5(b-d).The characterized signal of Mg 1s was found at 1303.27 eV (Fig. 5(b)), corresponding to Mg 2 in MgFe 2 O 4 19; the O 1s spectrum can be divided into three peaks at 529.20 eV, 530.16 eV and 531.53 eV, which were attributed to lattice oxygen, adsorbed oxygen species and oxygen vacancies, respectively 31,383940.According to the peak area ratio of the oxygen vacancy to all oxygen species, the defective oxygen proportion of Mg-Fe-650 and Mg-Fe-750 was 21.01 and 23.92, respectively, which demonstrated that the more oxygen vacancies were formed by increasing heating temperature from 650 C to 750 C.In Fig. 5(d), the binding energies of 710.16 eV and 724.22 eV for Fe 2p 3/2 and Fe 2p 1/2 with a shake-up satellite peak at 717.97 eV were observed, representing the characteristic of Fe 3 in the hybrid 16,41.The peaks located at 709.42 eV revealed the presence of Fe 2 2p 3/2 42.Notably, Fe 3 2p 3/2 and Fe 2p 1/2 of Mg-Fe-750 obviously appeared a slight shift to higher binding energy comparing with Mg-Fe-650, indicating stronger electronic interaction in Mg-Fe-750. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR) was carried out to directly determine the existence of oxygen vacancies.As shown in Fig. 6, a significant signal was detected at g2.003 in samples calcinated at 650, 750 and 850 C.Based on previous reports, the signal peak assigned to g2.001-2.004was ascribed to electron trapped on oxygen vacancies 43,44.Therefore, abundant oxygen vacancies on the surface of MgFe 2 O 4 were successfully constructed after heating process, and the EPR results showed the concentration of oxygen vacancies increased firstly with the increase in calcination temperature, then decreased with the further increase of calcination temperature, and the Mg-Fe-750 displayed the highest EPR signal among these samples, implying higher oxygen vacancies concentration, agreement with the result of O 1s spectrum. The light absorption properties of MgFe 2 O 4 samples were investigated by an UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS).In Fig. 7(a), all samples showed excellent absorption performance in visible light region (400-650 nm), demonstrating MgFe 2 O 4 samples belonged to the narrow-band gap semiconductor materials.The intensities of light absorption for as-prepared samples increased gradually with the calcination temperature getting higher.The enhancement in light absorption with the increase of calcination temperature can be due to the formation of more spine phase and the increase of oxygen vacancies.When calcination temperature is higher than 800 C, the light absorption decreases obviously, which can be due to the destruction of spinel phase as illustrated by XRD pattern.Notably, the increase in light absorption at 600-700 nm with the increase of calcination temperature was seen, which can be caused by the electron transition from donor state, or oxygen vacancies and structure defects 45, confirming that the content of oxygen vacancies is increased.The Mg-Fe-750 and Mg-Fe-800 samples exhibited the stronger visible light absorption.It may be due to the more oxygen vacancies generated during the heating process, which was conductive to the visible light absorption of the samples.The bandgap values of MgFe 2 O 4 samples were calculated by Kubelka-Munk function 17, as shown in Fig. 7(b).For the samples Mg-Fe-T (T 650, 700, 750, 800 and 850), the band gap width was 1.99, 2.08, 2.12, 2.17 and 2.04 eV, respectively. In order to further study the band structure, the Mott-Schottky diagram (Fig. 8a) was used to evaluate the flat band potential (E FB ), carrier's concentration and semiconductor type.All curves possessed positive slope, indicating that the samples obtained were n-type semiconductors.The electrode potential was converted to the standard hydrogen electrode (NHE) potential using the following relation: The E FB of Mg-Fe-T (T 650, 700, 750, 800 and 850) were -0.17, -0.22, -0.20, -0.15 and -0.13 V (Vs.NHE), respectively.It's well known that n-type semiconductor conduction potential (E CB ) is more negative 0.1 or 0.2 V than its E FB .In this paper, -0.2 V was used to calculate the E CB .The valence band potential (E VB ) was estimated by formula (2) using the band gap values calculated in Fig. 7b and summarized in Table 2. Room temperature PL spectra were detected to investigate the separation, migration and recombination process of photogenerated All samples exhibit the emission peak at 399 nm due to the recombination photo-induced carriers.It is noted that the PL intensity decreased firstly as the increase of calcination temperature then increased and the Mg-Fe-750 sample possessed the lowest PL emission peak.This result can be ascribed to the content of oxygen vacancies.Because the existence of oxygen vacancies can promote the separation of photogenerated electron and hole pairs.It is well known that the PL peak intensity is directly proportional to the rate of the electron-hole recombination.Therefore, the Mg-Fe-750 sample may have highest photocatalytic activity as compared with other samples.The optical response and photoelectrical chemical properties of the as-prepared samples were tested by electrochemical workstation.Fig. 9(a) showed the transient photocurrent response under 10 cycles of Xeon lamp irradiation equipped with a 420 nm cutoff filter.As can be seen in Fig. 9(a), all samples displayed photocurrent response under visible light irradiation, and photocurrent firstly increased gradually, then decreased with the increase of calcination temperature, Mg-Fe-750 sample have the highest photocurrent.When calcination temperature is lower, the enhancement of photocurrent with the increase of calcination temperature could be attributed to the increase of spine phase and oxygen vacancies content, the decline of photocurrent with further increase of calcination temperature might be due to the decrease of oxygen vacancy concentration and the destruction of spinel phase.In addition, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was investigated, as shown in Fig. 9(b).The arc radius of the Nyquist curves of the Mg-Fe-750 was smallest, indicating it had lowest interfacial resistance and highest charge carrier separation efficiency at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Since the chemisorption and activation of CO 2 on the surface of photocatalysts is directly related to the activity of photocatalyst, TPD and in-situ FTIR for CO 2 chemisorption were carried out to investigate the effects of calcination temperature on the absorption properties of CO 2 on the surface of Mg-Fe-T samples.Fig. 10(a) shows the results of TPD for CO 2 adsorption on the surface of Mg-Fe-T samples.For all catalysts, one peak centered at 127 C was observed, which was attributed to the desorption of CO 2 molecule.With the increase of calcination temperature of samples, the desorption amount of CO 2 increased firstly and then decreased, demonstrating the significant influence of calcination temperature on the adsorption amount of CO 2 .Mg-Fe-750 exhibited the largest adsorption amount of CO 2 , which can be related to the highest oxygen vacancy concentrate generated from the removal of oxygen. In order to determine the species of CO 2 intermediates on the surface of photocatalysts, in situ FTIR spectra after the adsorption of CO 2 for 1 h at 100 C on the surfaces of Mg-Fe-T in the dark were performed.As shown in the Fig. 10 (b), after the adsorption of CO 2 , the bands at 1330 cm -1 attributed to the monodentate carbonate group (m-CO 3 2-) 46, at 1351 cm -1 assigned to bidentate carbonate (b-CO 3 2-) 23, at 1300 cm -1 related to the vibration of adsorbed carbonate or bicarbonate 47, and at 1250 cm -1 belonged to the COO -species 48 were detected.These results showed that the adsorption of CO 2 on the surface of Mg-Fe-T promoted the formation of m-CO 3 , b-CO 3 2-and COO -, which have been reported as the reactive adsorbed species in photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 6,47,49. Similarly, the intensity of FTIR bands increased firstly and then decreased with the increase of calcination temperature, which is mainly due to the content of oxygen vacancies. The photocatalytic performance of as-prepared samples was evaluated by photocatalytic CO 2 reduction using water as a reducing agent at 160 C under visible light irradiation.The control tests were carried out and verified that no products were produced with the absence of light or photocatalyst.Additionally, when CO 2 was replaced by N 2 , only H 2 but no carbon containing product was detected, implying that the carbon-containing product was originated from CO 2 . Besides oxygen, H 2 and CO were found to be the major CO 2 reduction products.Fig. 11(a) displayed the average production rate of H 2 and CO from CO 2 reduction with H 2 O vapor over Mg-Fe-T (T 650, 700, 750, 800 and 850) during 2 h reaction under visible light irradiation (420 nm).It can be seen clearly that calcination temperature has a significant influence on photocatalytic activity.After 2 h irradiation, CO average production rates were 4.7, 13.3, 24.4,17.8 and 9.8 mol/gcat/h, and H 2 production rates was 17.5, 23.6, 34.3, 25.4 and 19.3 mol/gcat/h for Mg-Fe-650, Mg-Fe-700, Mg-Fe-750, Mg-Fe-800 and Mg-Fe-850, respectively.Obviously, the activity of photocatalysts increases with the increase of calcination temperature and reaches maxima at 750 C.After that, the activity decreases with further increasing of calcination temperature.Mg-Fe-750 exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity of CO 2 reduction among all samples, for which H 2 and CO production rates were about 5 and 2 times that of Mg-Fe-650 calcined at lower temperature.In addition, the selectivity of photo-generated electron for CO 2 reduction was calculated to be 21.1, 36, 41.6, 41.2 and 33.7 for Mg-Fe-650, Mg-Fe-700, Mg-Fe-750, Mg-Fe-800 and Mg-Fe-850, respectively.Obviously, the Mg-Fe-750 samples possesses the highest selectivity of CO 2 reduction. The stability of the used Mg-Fe-750 sample was further evaluated by circle experiments and the results was showed in Fig. 11 (b).The activity of as-prepared Mg-Fe-750 was still satisfactory after five cycles.The CO and H 2 production rates were decreased by 35.0 and 17.5 compared to those of the fresh photocatalyst, respectively.The decrease of yield was likely due to the reduction of oxygen vacancy on the surface of photocatalyst, which was repaired by oxygen from CO 2 molecule or O 2 formed during the photocatalytic reaction.This resulted into the decrease of photo absorption capacity and separation efficiency of photogenerated electron-hole pairs of Mg-Fe-750 sample, thus decreasing the photocatalytic activity. According to EPR, XPS, UV/vis DRS, PL spectra, photocurrent measurements, CO 2 -TPD and in situ FTIR results, the improvement in photocatalytic activity of Mg-Fe-T samples calcined at high temperature should be mainly ascribed to the content of spinel phase and oxygen vacancies.Firstly, the calcination temperature influences the crystal phase composition of Mg-Fe-T samples, and the samples calcined at lower temperature (600 C and 700 C) showed the presence of Fe 2 O 3 , which decreased the content of spinel phase.Also,"}], "reactor type": [], "operation mode": []}}
