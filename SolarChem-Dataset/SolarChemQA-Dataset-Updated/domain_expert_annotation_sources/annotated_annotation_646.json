The low-angle XRD patterns in Fig. 2a show that all samples display an evident diffraction attributed to the (100) reflection of the 2D hexagonal symmetry(p6 mm), indicating the regular mesostructures are reserved in the obtained catalysts, though the two higher diffractions at (110) and (200) are very undetectable, as confirmed by TEM (see below).As showed on the wide-angle XRD patterns (Fig. 2b), all the samples exhibit the diffraction peaks indexed to a cubic fluorite structure of CeO 2 with PDF number of 34-0394, but show no evident diffraction peak of Cr 2 O 3 characteristic phase, indicating nearly all the doped Cr species have entered the CeO 2 lattice.Moreover, with the increase of Cr doping concentration, the peaks attributed to the cubic fluorite phase shift to larger angle, because the Cr 3 radius is smaller than Ce 4 radius (0.69 vs. 0.97 A), which proves again the entrance of Cr 3 into the CeO 2 lattice.On the other hand, the crystallization degree of chromium doped CeO 2 is weakened slightly with the rise of Cr 3 concentration, since it is relieved by the foreign ion doping during calcination 33,34.Fig. 2c and d display the nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms and corresponding pore size distribution curves.The isotherms for all the samples are of typical type IV with a H 1 -type hysteresis loop in the relative pressure (P/P 0 ) range of 0.4-0.95,which is a characteristic of mesoporous non-siliceous materials prepared by the hard template method.As shown in Fig. 2d, all samples show a uniform pore size distribution around 3.5 nm, which agrees well with the wall thickness of the template SBA-15.The textural properties of these ordered mesoporous catalysts are listed in Table 1.Generally, their BET surface areas (126-169.3m 2 /g) and pore volumes (0.295-0.393 cm 3 /g) are both very large, and their specific surface areas slightly increase with the rise of Cr doping.Fig. 3 shows the TEM images of the representative chromium doped CeO 2 catalyst (M-15CrCeO 2 ) and non-doped mesoporous CeO 2 (M-CeO 2 ).Besides the rod-like morphology, both samples also clearly show an ordered 2D hexagonal mesostructure from the lowmagnification TEM images (left in Fig. 3), indicating the catalysts as-prepared are well reverse-replica of the template, which agrees well with the low-angle XRD patterns.The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images (right in Fig. 3) show the detailed mesostructures, and the pore walls are well composed by metal oxide nanocrystals with a nanoscale diameter (4-6 nm).The inset of Fig. 3 right shows the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns.All these results demonstrate the diffraction rings, suggesting that the metal oxide nanocrystals, as pore wall components, are polycrystalline.As shown in Fig. 4a, the fluorite-structured CeO 2 turn from bright yellow to light grey after Cr doping, and the color is darkened with further addition of Cr.Therefore, Cr doping alters the optical and surface chemical properties of CeO 2 . To understand the optical absorption properties of mesoporous CeO 2 and chromium doped CeO 2 , we examined their UV-vis DRS spectra within 200-800 nm (Fig. 4b).Clearly, the pure M-CeO 2 has an adsorption edge at about 410 nm, which catches with the band gap energy of about 2.7 eV.In comparison, the chromium doped samples show an obvious red-shift and significant absorption in the visible region from 400 to 700 nm, which suggest that the dopant energy level is formed within the band gap of CeO 2 .It is reported that the electronic migrations from the valence band to the dopant level and then to the conduction band could red shift of the band edge absorption threshold 35,36.The band gap energy E g can be derived from ( h ) n k(h -E g ), where is the absorption coefficient, h is the absorption energy, n is 1 / 2 for an indirect transition, and k is the parameter of the effective masses related to the valence and conduction bands 37.The extrapolated intercept corresponding to E g value can be determined by plotting ( h ) 1/2 versus h based on the spectral response in Fig. 4b.As shown in Table 1, the optical band gap energies of the M-5CrCeO 2 , M-10CrCeO 2 , M-15CrCeO 2 and M-20CrCeO 2 (1.50, 1.21, 0.92, and 1.05 eV, respectively) obviously red-shift relative to that of M-CeO 2 (2.66 eV), which are in agreement with the DRS results. The surface chemical states of Cr, Ce, and O in all catalysts were studied by XPS analysis.Fig. 4d shows the Cr 2p XPS spectra of the chromium doped mesoporous CeO 2 catalysts, it should be noted that the corresponding Cr 2p XPS peaks are weak.All samples show the binding energy at 577 eV for Cr 2p 3/2 and at 594 eV for Cr 2p 1/2 .The peak positions of Cr 2p 3/2 and Cr 2p 1/2 and their energy difference (17 eV) are the characteristic of Cr 3 in Cr 2 O 3 38,39.The surface Cr/(Cr Ce) molar percentages determined from XPS spectra (Table 1) are very close to the ratios in the initial mixtures. The Ce 3d spectra of the mesoporous CeO 2 and four chromium doped CeO 2 catalysts are shown in Fig. 4e.According to the labels used to identify Ce 3d XPS peaks 40, and u indicate the spinorbit coupling 3d 5/2 and 3d 3/2 , respectively.The peaks , , and attributed to CeO 2 are marked as Ce IV (3d 9 4f 2 ) O (2p 4 ), Ce IV (3d 9 4f 1 ) O (2p 5 ), and Ce IV (3d 9 4f 0 ) O (2p 6 ), respectively.The u structures are assigned in the same way.The /u doublet is attributed to the photoemission from Ce 3 cations 41.Thus, the surfaces of all catalysts are under both Ce 3 /Ce 4 oxidation states, as previously reported 42,43.The surface Ce 3 concentrations determined by XPS spectra deconvolution for all catalysts are listed in Table 2. Noticeably, the chromium doped CeO 2 catalysts contain much more Ce 3 than non-doped sample (M-CeO 2 ), indicating the doping of Cr 3 into CeO 2 leads the Ce 4 cations to be reduced partially 44.As showed on Fig. 4f, the broad O1s XPS spectra can be deconvoluted into three peaks: (1) the peak with the highest binding energy attributed to surface oxygen (OS) in hydroxyl species and/or adsorbed water species on surfaces, (2) the next is assigned to chemisorbed oxygen (OC) or/and weakly-bonded oxygen, and (3) the third peak at the lowest binding energy corresponding to lattice oxygen (OL) in the metal oxides 22,45.The OC/OT ratio (OT OL OC OS) for all catalysts was calculated according to the area integral of the three peaks respectively corresponding to OS, OC and OL of O1s photoemission (Table 2).Clearly, the introduction of Cr 3 species effectively increases the OC content on the surfaces of mesoporous CeO 2 catalyst, and the OC/OT ratio is maximized in M-15CrCeO 2 . To investigate the photocatalytic performances of the chromium doped mesoporous CeO 2 catalysts with different Cr doping concentrations, their efficiencies for the photocatalytic reduction CO 2 with H 2 O under visible-light irradiation were examined.For comparison, the photocatalytic activity of a commercial P25 titania (Evonik) with the BET surface area of 58.5 m 2 /g and the common CeO 2 with the BET surface area of 62.5 m 2 /g were also carried out under the same experimental condition.As shown on the evolution curves of two main products as a function of irradiation time (Fig. 5), the yields of CO and CH 4 both increase with the prolonging of irradiation time, and the CO formation is more favorable than CH 4 formation on all catalysts.Among all the tested catalysts, the commercial P25 presents the lowest photocatalytic activity because of the wide band gap and relative slow carrier transport of bare titania.Interestingly, the M-CeO 2 demonstrates a higher photocatalytic performance compared to the common CeO 2 , probably due to its mesostructure and larger specific surface area.It is also noted that the chromium doped mesoporous CeO 2 catalysts exhibit much higher activity than pure M-CeO 2 .Their performances are enhanced with further increase of Cr amount and are maximized in M-15CrCeO 2 with the production of 16.2 mol/g-cat.CO and 10.1 mol/g-cat.CH 4 after 8 h of visible-light irradiation, which are more than twice as high as that of non-doped M-CeO 2 and also much better than the values of TiO 2 -based photocatalysts previously reported 464748.However, a slightly decrease in the activity is caused with further increase of the Cr doping concentration in M-20CrCeO 2 , suggesting that the addition of Cr 3 species in the mesoporous CeO 2 should be selected for the optimal catalytic activity. The products were also analyzed by gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD), where O 2 could be detected.Under visible-light irradiation, the dominating reactions involved in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O to produce CO and CH 4 are summarized as follows 4,49,50: As shown from the Eqs.( 1)-( 4), the electrons (e -) and hole (h ) generated by the light irradiation are the key factors for this photocatalytic reaction.Electrons are excited from the VB to the CB and reacted with CO 2 molecule to produce CO and CH 4 , while the holes remaining on the VB could oxidize H 2 O to form oxygen (O 2 ).Photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 is a process of multi-electron steps, the formation of 1CO and 1CH 4 respectively require 2 and 8 electrons, and 4 holes are needed to form 1O 2 molecule.Thus, not only CO and CH 4 are produced in this reaction, but also O 2 is formed.Therefore, the improved photocatalytic activity of the chromium doped mesoporous CeO 2 catalysts may also attribute to their reduced recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs because of the Cr doped.To provide sufficient evidence and to examine the above suggested mechanism of photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 , the EIS analysis was carried out to investigate the photogenerated charge separation process.Fig. 6a shows the EIS Nyquist plots of the chromium doped mesoporous CeO 2 catalysts.Generally, a larger arc radius of the EIS Nyquist plot indicates a lower charge transfer efficiency 51,52.Evidently, the arc radii of the chromium doped CeO 2 catalysts are smaller than that of the M-CeO 2 , suggesting that the interfacial charge transfer and effective separation of photoinduced electron-hole pairs are significantly enhanced after doping with Cr species. As a result of various experiments, we consider that the excellent photocatalytic performance can be attributed to the special composition and structure of the chromium doped mesoporous CeO 2 catalysts, which account for various beneficial properties.First, 2D hexagonal mesostructure with high surface area allows the effective transportation of gas reactants to photoactive sites and accelerates the diffusion of the products.Second, the addition of Cr species into mesoporous CeO 2 can significantly enhance its absorption of visible light because of the decreased band gap.Under the visible-light illumination, the excited electrons in the valence band are easily transferred to the forbidden band and leave holes in the valence band of the chromium doped catalysts.Also the increased conductivity of chromium doped CeO 2 catalysts will promote the interfacial charge transfer and the separation of photogenerated electron-hole during photocatalysis, thus improving the photocatalytic activity under visible-light irradiation (Fig. 6b).Finally, XPS shows the existence of the Ce 3 /Ce 4 oxidation state mixture on the catalyst surface, suggesting the oxidization of some metal ions in the composites is incomplete, so partial Ce 3 can interact with holes to inhibit the recombination of photoinduced electron-hole pairs.It is also proved that the addition of Cr 3 greatly enhances the surface chemisorbed oxygen in the chromium doped mesoporous CeO 2 catalysts.These oxygen species can easily capture electrons to form reductive surface oxygen radicals 53, which largely accelerates the photocatalytic CO 2 conversion."}, {"llm generation": "chromium doped CeO 2 catalyst (M-15CrCeO 2 )", "source": "Fig. 3 shows the TEM images of the representative chromium doped CeO 2 catalyst (M-15CrCeO 2 ) and non-doped mesoporous CeO 2 (M-CeO 2 ).", "context": "The XRD patterns of the prepared chromium doped CeO 2 catalysts with different Cr doping concentrations are presented in Fig. 2.

The surface chemical states of Cr, Ce, and O in all catalysts were studied by XPS analysis.Fig. 4d shows the Cr 2p XPS spectra of the chromium doped mesoporous CeO 2 catalysts, it should be noted that the corresponding Cr 2p XPS peaks are weak.All samples show the binding energy at 577 eV for Cr 2p 3/2 and at 594 eV for Cr 2p 1/2 .The peak positions of Cr 2p 3/2 and Cr 2p 1/2 and their energy difference (17 eV) are the characteristic of Cr 3 in Cr 2 O 3 38,39.The surface Cr/(Cr Ce) molar percentages determined from XPS spectra (Table 1) are very close to the ratios in the initial mixtures. The Ce 3d spectra of the mesoporous CeO 2 and four chromium doped CeO 2 catalysts are shown in Fig. 4e.According to the labels used to identify Ce 3d XPS peaks 40, and u indicate the spinorbit coupling 3d 5/2 and 3d 3/2 , respectively.The peaks , , and attributed to CeO 2 are marked as Ce IV (3d 9 4f 2 ) O (2p 4 ), Ce IV (3d 9 4f 1 ) O (2p 5 ), and Ce IV (3d 9 4f 0 ) O (2p 6 ), respectively.The u structures are assigned in the same way.The /u doublet is attributed to the photoemission from Ce 3 cations 41.Thus, the surfaces of all catalysts are under both Ce 3 /Ce 4 oxidation states, as previously reported 42,43.The surface Ce 3 concentrations determined by XPS spectra deconvolution for all catalysts are listed in Table 2. Noticeably, the chromium doped CeO 2 catalysts contain much more Ce 3 than non-doped sample (M-CeO 2 ), indicating the doping of Cr 3 into CeO 2 leads the Ce 4 cations to be reduced partially 44.As showed on Fig. 4f, the broad O1s XPS spectra can be deconvoluted into three peaks: (1) the peak with the highest binding energy attributed to surface oxygen (OS) in hydroxyl species and/or adsorbed water species on surfaces, (2) the next is assigned to chemisorbed oxygen (OC) or/and weakly-bonded oxygen, and (3) the third peak at the lowest binding energy corresponding to lattice oxygen (OL) in the metal oxides 22,45.The OC/OT ratio (OT OL OC OS) for all catalysts was calculated according to the area integral of the three peaks respectively corresponding to OS, OC and OL of O1s photoemission (Table 2).Clearly, the introduction of Cr 3 species effectively increases the OC content on the surfaces of mesoporous CeO 2 catalyst, and the OC/OT ratio is maximized in M-15CrCeO 2 . To investigate the photocatalytic performances of the chromium doped mesoporous CeO 2 catalysts with different Cr doping concentrations, their efficiencies for the photocatalytic reduction CO 2 with H 2 O under visible-light irradiation were examined.For comparison, the photocatalytic activity of a commercial P25 titania (Evonik) with the BET surface area of 58.5 m 2 /g and the common CeO 2 with the BET surface area of 62.5 m 2 /g were also carried out under the same experimental condition.As shown on the evolution curves of two main products as a function of irradiation time (Fig. 5), the yields of CO and CH 4 both increase with the prolonging of irradiation time, and the CO formation is more favorable than CH 4 formation on all catalysts.Among all the tested catalysts, the commercial P25 presents the lowest photocatalytic activity because of the wide band gap and relative slow carrier transport of bare titania.Interestingly, the M-CeO 2 demonstrates a higher photocatalytic performance compared to the common CeO 2 , probably due to its mesostructure and larger specific surface area.It is also noted that the chromium doped mesoporous CeO 2 catalysts exhibit much higher activity than pure M-CeO 2 .Their performances are enhanced with further increase of Cr amount and are maximized in M-15CrCeO 2 with the production of 16.2 mol/g-cat.CO and 10.1 mol/g-cat.CH 4 after 8 h of visible-light irradiation, which are more than twice as high as that of non-doped M-CeO 2 and also much better than the values of TiO 2 -based photocatalysts previously reported 464748.However, a slightly decrease in the activity is caused with further increase of the Cr doping concentration in M-20CrCeO 2 , suggesting that the addition of Cr 3 species in the mesoporous CeO 2 should be selected for the optimal catalytic activity. The products were also analyzed by gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD), where O 2 could be detected.Under visible-light irradiation, the dominating reactions involved in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O to produce CO and CH 4 are summarized as follows 4,49,50: As shown from the Eqs.( 1)-( 4), the electrons (e -) and hole (h ) generated by the light irradiation are the key factors for this photocatalytic reaction.Electrons are excited from the VB to the CB and reacted with CO 2 molecule to produce CO and CH 4 , while the holes remaining on the VB could oxidize H 2 O to form oxygen (O 2 ).Photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 is a process of multi-electron steps, the formation of 1CO and 1CH 4 respectively require 2 and 8 electrons, and 4 holes are needed to form 1O 2 molecule.Thus, not only CO and CH 4 are produced in this reaction, but also O 2 is formed.Therefore, the improved photocatalytic activity of the chromium doped mesoporous CeO 2 catalysts may also attribute to their reduced recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs because of the Cr doped.To provide sufficient evidence and to examine the above suggested mechanism of photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 , the EIS analysis was carried out to investigate the photogenerated charge separation process.Fig. 6a shows the EIS Nyquist plots of the chromium doped mesoporous CeO 2 catalysts.Generally, a larger arc radius of the EIS Nyquist plot indicates a lower charge transfer efficiency 51,52.Evidently, the arc radii of the chromium doped CeO 2 catalysts are smaller than that of the M-CeO 2 , suggesting that the interfacial charge transfer and effective separation of photoinduced electron-hole pairs are significantly enhanced after doping with Cr species. As a result of various experiments, we consider that the excellent photocatalytic performance can be attributed to the special composition and structure of the chromium doped mesoporous CeO 2 catalysts, which account for various beneficial properties.First, 2D hexagonal mesostructure with high surface area allows the effective transportation of gas reactants to photoactive sites and accelerates the diffusion of the products.Second, the addition of Cr species into mesoporous CeO 2 can significantly enhance its absorption of visible light because of the decreased band gap.Under the visible-light illumination, the excited electrons in the valence band are easily transferred to the forbidden band and leave holes in the valence band of the chromium doped catalysts.Also the increased conductivity of chromium doped CeO 2 catalysts will promote the interfacial charge transfer and the separation of photogenerated electron-hole during photocatalysis, thus improving the photocatalytic activity under visible-light irradiation (Fig. 6b).Finally, XPS shows the existence of the Ce 3 /Ce 4 oxidation state mixture on the catalyst surface, suggesting the oxidization of some metal ions in the composites is incomplete, so partial Ce 3 can interact with holes to inhibit the recombination of photoinduced electron-hole pairs.It is also proved that the addition of Cr 3 greatly enhances the surface chemisorbed oxygen in the chromium doped mesoporous CeO 2 catalysts.These oxygen species can easily capture electrons to form reductive surface oxygen radicals 53, which largely accelerates the photocatalytic CO 2 conversion."}, {"llm generation": "non-doped mesoporous CeO 2 (M-CeO 2 )", "source": "Fig. 3 shows the TEM images of the representative chromium doped CeO 2 catalyst (M-15CrCeO 2 ) and non-doped mesoporous CeO 2 (M-CeO 2 ).", "context": "The XRD patterns of the prepared chromium doped CeO 2 catalysts with different Cr doping concentrations are presented in Fig. 2.

To investigate the photocatalytic performances of the chromium doped mesoporous CeO 2 catalysts with different Cr doping concentrations, their efficiencies for the photocatalytic reduction CO 2 with H 2 O under visible-light irradiation were examined.For comparison, the photocatalytic activity of a commercial P25 titania (Evonik) with the BET surface area of 58.5 m 2 /g and the common CeO 2 with the BET surface area of 62.5 m 2 /g were also carried out under the same experimental condition.As shown on the evolution curves of two main products as a function of irradiation time (Fig. 5), the yields of CO and CH 4 both increase with the prolonging of irradiation time, and the CO formation is more favorable than CH 4 formation on all catalysts.Among all the tested catalysts, the commercial P25 presents the lowest photocatalytic activity because of the wide band gap and relative slow carrier transport of bare titania.Interestingly, the M-CeO 2 demonstrates a higher photocatalytic performance compared to the common CeO 2 , probably due to its mesostructure and larger specific surface area.It is also noted that the chromium doped mesoporous CeO 2 catalysts exhibit much higher activity than pure M-CeO 2 .Their performances are enhanced with further increase of Cr amount and are maximized in M-15CrCeO 2 with the production of 16.2 mol/g-cat.CO and 10.1 mol/g-cat.CH 4 after 8 h of visible-light irradiation, which are more than twice as high as that of non-doped M-CeO 2 and also much better than the values of TiO 2 -based photocatalysts previously reported 464748.However, a slightly decrease in the activity is caused with further increase of the Cr doping concentration in M-20CrCeO 2 , suggesting that the addition of Cr 3 species in the mesoporous CeO 2 should be selected for the optimal catalytic activity. The products were also analyzed by gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD), where O 2 could be detected.Under visible-light irradiation, the dominating reactions involved in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O to produce CO and CH 4 are summarized as follows 4,49,50: As shown from the Eqs.( 1)-( 4), the electrons (e -) and hole (h ) generated by the light irradiation are the key factors for this photocatalytic reaction.Electrons are excited from the VB to the CB and reacted with CO 2 molecule to produce CO and CH 4 , while the holes remaining on the VB could oxidize H 2 O to form oxygen (O 2 ).Photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 is a process of multi-electron steps, the formation of 1CO and 1CH 4 respectively require 2 and 8 electrons, and 4 holes are needed to form 1O 2 molecule.Thus, not only CO and CH 4 are produced in this reaction, but also O 2 is formed.Therefore, the improved photocatalytic activity of the chromium doped mesoporous CeO 2 catalysts may also attribute to their reduced recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs because of the Cr doped.To provide sufficient evidence and to examine the above suggested mechanism of photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 , the EIS analysis was carried out to investigate the photogenerated charge separation process.Fig. 6a shows the EIS Nyquist plots of the chromium doped mesoporous CeO 2 catalysts.Generally, a larger arc radius of the EIS Nyquist plot indicates a lower charge transfer efficiency 51,52.Evidently, the arc radii of the chromium doped CeO 2 catalysts are smaller than that of the M-CeO 2 , suggesting that the interfacial charge transfer and effective separation of photoinduced electron-hole pairs are significantly enhanced after doping with Cr species. As a result of various experiments, we consider that the excellent photocatalytic performance can be attributed to the special composition and structure of the chromium doped mesoporous CeO 2 catalysts, which account for various beneficial properties.First, 2D hexagonal mesostructure with high surface area allows the effective transportation of gas reactants to photoactive sites and accelerates the diffusion of the products.Second, the addition of Cr species into mesoporous CeO 2 can significantly enhance its absorption of visible light because of the decreased band gap.Under the visible-light illumination, the excited electrons in the valence band are easily transferred to the forbidden band and leave holes in the valence band of the chromium doped catalysts.Also the increased conductivity of chromium doped CeO 2 catalysts will promote the interfacial charge transfer and the separation of photogenerated electron-hole during photocatalysis, thus improving the photocatalytic activity under visible-light irradiation (Fig. 6b).Finally, XPS shows the existence of the Ce 3 /Ce 4 oxidation state mixture on the catalyst surface, suggesting the oxidization of some metal ions in the composites is incomplete, so partial Ce 3 can interact with holes to inhibit the recombination of photoinduced electron-hole pairs.It is also proved that the addition of Cr 3 greatly enhances the surface chemisorbed oxygen in the chromium doped mesoporous CeO 2 catalysts.These oxygen species can easily capture electrons to form reductive surface oxygen radicals 53, which largely accelerates the photocatalytic CO 2 conversion."}, {"llm generation": "commercial P25 titania (Evonik)", "source": "For comparison, the photocatalytic activity of a commercial P25 titania (Evonik) with the BET surface area of 58.5 m 2 /g and the common CeO 2 with the BET surface area of 62.5 m 2 /g were also carried out under the same experimental condition.", "context": "The XRD patterns of the prepared chromium doped CeO 2 catalysts with different Cr doping concentrations are presented in Fig. 2. The low-angle XRD patterns in Fig. 2a show that all samples display an evident diffraction attributed to the (100) reflection of the 2D hexagonal symmetry(p6 mm), indicating the regular mesostructures are reserved in the obtained catalysts, though the two higher diffractions at (110) and (200) are very undetectable, as confirmed by TEM (see below).As showed on the wide-angle XRD patterns (Fig. 2b), all the samples exhibit the diffraction peaks indexed to a cubic fluorite structure of CeO 2 with PDF number of 34-0394, but show no evident diffraction peak of Cr 2 O 3 characteristic phase, indicating nearly all the doped Cr species have entered the CeO 2 lattice.Moreover, with the increase of Cr doping concentration, the peaks attributed to the cubic fluorite phase shift to larger angle, because the Cr 3 radius is smaller than Ce 4 radius (0.69 vs. 0.97 A), which proves again the entrance of Cr 3 into the CeO 2 lattice.On the other hand, the crystallization degree of chromium doped CeO 2 is weakened slightly with the rise of Cr 3 concentration, since it is relieved by the foreign ion doping during calcination 33,34.Fig. 2c and d display the nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms and corresponding pore size distribution curves.The isotherms for all the samples are of typical type IV with a H 1 -type hysteresis loop in the relative pressure (P/P 0 ) range of 0.4-0.95,which is a characteristic of mesoporous non-siliceous materials prepared by the hard template method.As shown in Fig. 2d, all samples show a uniform pore size distribution around 3.5 nm, which agrees well with the wall thickness of the template SBA-15.The textural properties of these ordered mesoporous catalysts are listed in Table 1.Generally, their BET surface areas (126-169.3m 2 /g) and pore volumes (0.295-0.393 cm 3 /g) are both very large, and their specific surface areas slightly increase with the rise of Cr doping.Fig. 3 shows the TEM images of the representative chromium doped CeO 2 catalyst (M-15CrCeO 2 ) and non-doped mesoporous CeO 2 (M-CeO 2 ).Besides the rod-like morphology, both samples also clearly show an ordered 2D hexagonal mesostructure from the lowmagnification TEM images (left in Fig. 3), indicating the catalysts as-prepared are well reverse-replica of the template, which agrees well with the low-angle XRD patterns.The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images (right in Fig. 3) show the detailed mesostructures, and the pore walls are well composed by metal oxide nanocrystals with a nanoscale diameter (4-6 nm).The inset of Fig. 3 right shows the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns.All these results demonstrate the diffraction rings, suggesting that the metal oxide nanocrystals, as pore wall components, are polycrystalline.As shown in Fig. 4a, the fluorite-structured CeO 2 turn from bright yellow to light grey after Cr doping, and the color is darkened with further addition of Cr.Therefore, Cr doping alters the optical and surface chemical properties of CeO 2 . To understand the optical absorption properties of mesoporous CeO 2 and chromium doped CeO 2 , we examined their UV-vis DRS spectra within 200-800 nm (Fig. 4b).Clearly, the pure M-CeO 2 has an adsorption edge at about 410 nm, which catches with the band gap energy of about 2.7 eV.In comparison, the chromium doped samples show an obvious red-shift and significant absorption in the visible region from 400 to 700 nm, which suggest that the dopant energy level is formed within the band gap of CeO 2 .It is reported that the electronic migrations from the valence band to the dopant level and then to the conduction band could red shift of the band edge absorption threshold 35,36.The band gap energy E g can be derived from ( h ) n k(h -E g ), where is the absorption coefficient, h is the absorption energy, n is 1 / 2 for an indirect transition, and k is the parameter of the effective masses related to the valence and conduction bands 37.The extrapolated intercept corresponding to E g value can be determined by plotting ( h ) 1/2 versus h based on the spectral response in Fig. 4b.As shown in Table 1, the optical band gap energies of the M-5CrCeO 2 , M-10CrCeO 2 , M-15CrCeO 2 and M-20CrCeO 2 (1.50, 1.21, 0.92, and 1.05 eV, respectively) obviously red-shift relative to that of M-CeO 2 (2.66 eV), which are in agreement with the DRS results. The surface chemical states of Cr, Ce, and O in all catalysts were studied by XPS analysis.Fig. 4d shows the Cr 2p XPS spectra of the chromium doped mesoporous CeO 2 catalysts, it should be noted that the corresponding Cr 2p XPS peaks are weak.All samples show the binding energy at 577 eV for Cr 2p 3/2 and at 594 eV for Cr 2p 1/2 .The peak positions of Cr 2p 3/2 and Cr 2p 1/2 and their energy difference (17 eV) are the characteristic of Cr 3 in Cr 2 O 3 38,39.The surface Cr/(Cr Ce) molar percentages determined from XPS spectra (Table 1) are very close to the ratios in the initial mixtures.

The low-angle XRD patterns in Fig. 2a show that all samples display an evident diffraction attributed to the (100) reflection of the 2D hexagonal symmetry(p6 mm), indicating the regular mesostructures are reserved in the obtained catalysts, though the two higher diffractions at (110) and (200) are very undetectable, as confirmed by TEM (see below).As showed on the wide-angle XRD patterns (Fig. 2b), all the samples exhibit the diffraction peaks indexed to a cubic fluorite structure of CeO 2 with PDF number of 34-0394, but show no evident diffraction peak of Cr 2 O 3 characteristic phase, indicating nearly all the doped Cr species have entered the CeO 2 lattice.Moreover, with the increase of Cr doping concentration, the peaks attributed to the cubic fluorite phase shift to larger angle, because the Cr 3 radius is smaller than Ce 4 radius (0.69 vs. 0.97 A), which proves again the entrance of Cr 3 into the CeO 2 lattice.On the other hand, the crystallization degree of chromium doped CeO 2 is weakened slightly with the rise of Cr 3 concentration, since it is relieved by the foreign ion doping during calcination 33,34.Fig. 2c and d display the nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms and corresponding pore size distribution curves.The isotherms for all the samples are of typical type IV with a H 1 -type hysteresis loop in the relative pressure (P/P 0 ) range of 0.4-0.95,which is a characteristic of mesoporous non-siliceous materials prepared by the hard template method.As shown in Fig. 2d, all samples show a uniform pore size distribution around 3.5 nm, which agrees well with the wall thickness of the template SBA-15.The textural properties of these ordered mesoporous catalysts are listed in Table 1.Generally, their BET surface areas (126-169.3m 2 /g) and pore volumes (0.295-0.393 cm 3 /g) are both very large, and their specific surface areas slightly increase with the rise of Cr doping.Fig. 3 shows the TEM images of the representative chromium doped CeO 2 catalyst (M-15CrCeO 2 ) and non-doped mesoporous CeO 2 (M-CeO 2 ).Besides the rod-like morphology, both samples also clearly show an ordered 2D hexagonal mesostructure from the lowmagnification TEM images (left in Fig. 3), indicating the catalysts as-prepared are well reverse-replica of the template, which agrees well with the low-angle XRD patterns.The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images (right in Fig. 3) show the detailed mesostructures, and the pore walls are well composed by metal oxide nanocrystals with a nanoscale diameter (4-6 nm).The inset of Fig. 3 right shows the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns.All these results demonstrate the diffraction rings, suggesting that the metal oxide nanocrystals, as pore wall components, are polycrystalline.As shown in Fig. 4a, the fluorite-structured CeO 2 turn from bright yellow to light grey after Cr doping, and the color is darkened with further addition of Cr.Therefore, Cr doping alters the optical and surface chemical properties of CeO 2 . To understand the optical absorption properties of mesoporous CeO 2 and chromium doped CeO 2 , we examined their UV-vis DRS spectra within 200-800 nm (Fig. 4b).Clearly, the pure M-CeO 2 has an adsorption edge at about 410 nm, which catches with the band gap energy of about 2.7 eV.In comparison, the chromium doped samples show an obvious red-shift and significant absorption in the visible region from 400 to 700 nm, which suggest that the dopant energy level is formed within the band gap of CeO 2 .It is reported that the electronic migrations from the valence band to the dopant level and then to the conduction band could red shift of the band edge absorption threshold 35,36.The band gap energy E g can be derived from ( h ) n k(h -E g ), where is the absorption coefficient, h is the absorption energy, n is 1 / 2 for an indirect transition, and k is the parameter of the effective masses related to the valence and conduction bands 37.The extrapolated intercept corresponding to E g value can be determined by plotting ( h ) 1/2 versus h based on the spectral response in Fig. 4b.As shown in Table 1, the optical band gap energies of the M-5CrCeO 2 , M-10CrCeO 2 , M-15CrCeO 2 and M-20CrCeO 2 (1.50, 1.21, 0.92, and 1.05 eV, respectively) obviously red-shift relative to that of M-CeO 2 (2.66 eV), which are in agreement with the DRS results. The surface chemical states of Cr, Ce, and O in all catalysts were studied by XPS analysis.Fig. 4d shows the Cr 2p XPS spectra of the chromium doped mesoporous CeO 2 catalysts, it should be noted that the corresponding Cr 2p XPS peaks are weak.All samples show the binding energy at 577 eV for Cr 2p 3/2 and at 594 eV for Cr 2p 1/2 .The peak positions of Cr 2p 3/2 and Cr 2p 1/2 and their energy difference (17 eV) are the characteristic of Cr 3 in Cr 2 O 3 38,39.The surface Cr/(Cr Ce) molar percentages determined from XPS spectra (Table 1) are very close to the ratios in the initial mixtures. The Ce 3d spectra of the mesoporous CeO 2 and four chromium doped CeO 2 catalysts are shown in Fig. 4e.According to the labels used to identify Ce 3d XPS peaks 40, and u indicate the spinorbit coupling 3d 5/2 and 3d 3/2 , respectively.The peaks , , and attributed to CeO 2 are marked as Ce IV (3d 9 4f 2 ) O (2p 4 ), Ce IV (3d 9 4f 1 ) O (2p 5 ), and Ce IV (3d 9 4f 0 ) O (2p 6 ), respectively.The u structures are assigned in the same way.The /u doublet is attributed to the photoemission from Ce 3 cations 41.Thus, the surfaces of all catalysts are under both Ce 3 /Ce 4 oxidation states, as previously reported 42,43.The surface Ce 3 concentrations determined by XPS spectra deconvolution for all catalysts are listed in Table 2. Noticeably, the chromium doped CeO 2 catalysts contain much more Ce 3 than non-doped sample (M-CeO 2 ), indicating the doping of Cr 3 into CeO 2 leads the Ce 4 cations to be reduced partially 44.As showed on Fig. 4f, the broad O1s XPS spectra can be deconvoluted into three peaks: (1) the peak with the highest binding energy attributed to surface oxygen (OS) in hydroxyl species and/or adsorbed water species on surfaces, (2) the next is assigned to chemisorbed oxygen (OC) or/and weakly-bonded oxygen, and (3) the third peak at the lowest binding energy corresponding to lattice oxygen (OL) in the metal oxides 22,45.The OC/OT ratio (OT OL OC OS) for all catalysts was calculated according to the area integral of the three peaks respectively corresponding to OS, OC and OL of O1s photoemission (Table 2).Clearly, the introduction of Cr 3 species effectively increases the OC content on the surfaces of mesoporous CeO 2 catalyst, and the OC/OT ratio is maximized in M-15CrCeO 2 . To investigate the photocatalytic performances of the chromium doped mesoporous CeO 2 catalysts with different Cr doping concentrations, their efficiencies for the photocatalytic reduction CO 2 with H 2 O under visible-light irradiation were examined.For comparison, the photocatalytic activity of a commercial P25 titania (Evonik) with the BET surface area of 58.5 m 2 /g and the common CeO 2 with the BET surface area of 62.5 m 2 /g were also carried out under the same experimental condition.As shown on the evolution curves of two main products as a function of irradiation time (Fig. 5), the yields of CO and CH 4 both increase with the prolonging of irradiation time, and the CO formation is more favorable than CH 4 formation on all catalysts.Among all the tested catalysts, the commercial P25 presents the lowest photocatalytic activity because of the wide band gap and relative slow carrier transport of bare titania.Interestingly, the M-CeO 2 demonstrates a higher photocatalytic performance compared to the common CeO 2 , probably due to its mesostructure and larger specific surface area.It is also noted that the chromium doped mesoporous CeO 2 catalysts exhibit much higher activity than pure M-CeO 2 .Their performances are enhanced with further increase of Cr amount and are maximized in M-15CrCeO 2 with the production of 16.2 mol/g-cat.CO and 10.1 mol/g-cat.CH 4 after 8 h of visible-light irradiation, which are more than twice as high as that of non-doped M-CeO 2 and also much better than the values of TiO 2 -based photocatalysts previously reported 464748.However, a slightly decrease in the activity is caused with further increase of the Cr doping concentration in M-20CrCeO 2 , suggesting that the addition of Cr 3 species in the mesoporous CeO 2 should be selected for the optimal catalytic activity. The products were also analyzed by gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD), where O 2 could be detected.Under visible-light irradiation, the dominating reactions involved in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O to produce CO and CH 4 are summarized as follows 4,49,50: As shown from the Eqs.( 1)-( 4), the electrons (e -) and hole (h ) generated by the light irradiation are the key factors for this photocatalytic reaction.Electrons are excited from the VB to the CB and reacted with CO 2 molecule to produce CO and CH 4 , while the holes remaining on the VB could oxidize H 2 O to form oxygen (O 2 ).Photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 is a process of multi-electron steps, the formation of 1CO and 1CH 4 respectively require 2 and 8 electrons, and 4 holes are needed to form 1O 2 molecule.Thus, not only CO and CH 4 are produced in this reaction, but also O 2 is formed.Therefore, the improved photocatalytic activity of the chromium doped mesoporous CeO 2 catalysts may also attribute to their reduced recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs because of the Cr doped.To provide sufficient evidence and to examine the above suggested mechanism of photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 , the EIS analysis was carried out to investigate the photogenerated charge separation process.Fig. 6a shows the EIS Nyquist plots of the chromium doped mesoporous CeO 2 catalysts.Generally, a larger arc radius of the EIS Nyquist plot indicates a lower charge transfer efficiency 51,52.Evidently, the arc radii of the chromium doped CeO 2 catalysts are smaller than that of the M-CeO 2 , suggesting that the interfacial charge transfer and effective separation of photoinduced electron-hole pairs are significantly enhanced after doping with Cr species.

Low-angle XRD patterns were collected in the A-2A mode using a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer (Cu K 1 radiation, 1.5406A), operated at 40 kV and 40 mA (scanning step: 0.02 /s).Wide-angle XRD patterns were collected in the same mode.TEM images were obtained by employing a JEOL JEM-2010 electron microscope with an acceleration voltage of 200 kV.Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms were recorded at -196 C on a Beishide 3H-2000PS4 nitrogen adsorption apparatus with all samples degassed at 200 C prior to measurements.The UV-vis DRS spectra within 200-800 nm were recorded on a Varian Cary 500 Scan UV-vis system.EIS measurements were measured on a CHI 660 B electrochemical workstation (Chenhua Instrument Company, Shanghai, China) with a frequency range from 0.01 Hz to 100 kHz at 0.24 V at the open circle voltage.XPS spectra were recorded on an RBO upgraded PHI-5000C ESCA system (Pekin Elmer) using monochromated Al K X-rays (h 1486.6eV) as a radiation at 250 W. The binding energy was calibrated with the contaminant carbon (C 1S 284.6 eV) used as a reference. Photocatalytic performances for the reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O were tested in a 2700 mL homemade stainless steel reactor under visible-light irradiation (Fig. 1).In each experiment, 0.1 g of catalyst powder was dispersed on the stainless omentum which was installed in the center of the reactor.Prior to illumination, the reactor was vacuumed and purged with the CO 2 H 2 O mixture at about 20 mL/min for 2 h until the adsorption-desorption was balanced, and gas phase volume concentrations of CO 2 and H 2 O were controlled at about 95.5 and 4.5 (the H 2 O vapor was bubbled into the reactor by CO 2 ).After that, the reactor was tightly closed and then a 500 W Xe arc lamp with a 420-nm filter was opened to start the tests.The substrate-lamp distance was about 15 cm, the reaction temperature and pressure were respectively controlled at 30 C and 110 KPa.The gas phase products were collected at different time periods during the illumination and analyzed online by gas chromatography."}], "reactor type": [], "operation mode": []}}
