The NiTiO 3 nanorods were synthesized by a sol-gel method.Briefly, 3.4 mL Ti(OC 4 H 9 ) 4 (tetrabutyl titanate) and 2.48 g Ni(CH3COO) 2 4H 2 O (nickel acetate tetrahydrate) were dissolved in 60 mL ethylene glycol, followed by stirring at 25 C for 2 h.Then, the bluish precipitate was collected by centrifugation, washed several times using distilled water and ethanol, and dried in a vacuum oven at 80 C for 12 h.Finally, the powder was calcined at 600 C for 2 h in the muffle furnace to obtain the NiTiO 3 nanorods. The NiTiO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composite was prepared by ultrasoniccalcination method.In detail, 0.2 g of g-C 3 N 4 and an appropriate amount of NiTiO 3 were dispersed in 30 mL of methanol by ultrasound for 2 h, and then stirred for 6 h.In this process, the NiTiO 3 nanorods would disperse into the g-C 3 N 4 nanoparticles.After that, the yellow slurry was centrifuged and dried in the vacuum oven at 80 C for 12 h.Finally, the product was calcined at 400 C for 2 h in the muffle furnace.The samples with NiTiO 3 to NiTiO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 mass ratios of 20, 40, 60, 80 were denoted as NT/GCN20, NT/GCN40, NT/GCN60, NT/ GCN80. The power X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained on a Purkinjie XD-3 diffractometer using Cu K radiation.The morphologies and microstructures of the materials were measured by a transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-2100) and a high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, Tecnai G2 F30).The electron state and surface composition were assessed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, PHI-5000C ESCA).The UV-vis absorption spectra were carried out on Shimadzu UV-2600 with BaSO 4 as the reference material.The Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET) surface area was measured with N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms at 77 K in the Micromeritics ASAP 2460.CO 2 temperature programmed desorption (CO 2 -TPD) experiments were conducted on an automated chemisorption apparatus (Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920).Firstly, the sample (0.1 g) was treated under helium flow (50 sccm) up to 300 C at 10 C/min for min and then cooled to 50 C. Secondly, CO 2 (30 sccm) was introduced and adsorbed on the catalyst for 60 min.Thirdly, the sample was flushed by helium flow (30 sccm) for 30 min.Finally, the TPD analysis was carried out under helium flow (30 sccm) with a ramp rate of 10 C/min up to 450 C. Before the measurement, the materials were dried in the vacuum oven at 120 C for 12 h to remove water.The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra was obtained on a Nicolet-iS10 spectrophotometer.The photoluminescence (PL) spectra and time-resolved fluorescence measurements were obtained using a fluorescence spectrometer Edinburgh FLS-980 at an excitation wavelength of 375 nm.The electron spin resonance (ESR) analysis was performed on a Bruker EMX-10/12type spectrometer. The photocurrent response and electrochemistry impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis were conducted on an electrochemical analyzer (CHI 760E) in a three-electrode system with Pt wire as a counter electrode, Ag/AgCl as a reference electrode and the photocatalyst as a working electrode.The working electrode was prepared as follows: mg photocatalyst was dispersed in 30 uL nafion and 1 mL ethanol, and then the mixture was treated with sonication for 1 h to make a slurry. Next, 300 L of the slurry was coated onto a 2.0 1.0 cm FTO glass. Finally, the working electrode was dried in a vacuum oven at 150 C. All of the samples were tested in 0.5 M Na 2 SO 4 electrolyte solution. The experiments of CO 2 photoreduction in the presence of H 2 O were performed in a 100 mL autoclave (Anhui Kemi Machinery Technology Co., Ltd, China) with a quartz window (Fig. S1).The temperature of the reactor was controlled by the circulating water passing through the jacketed wall.A 300 W Xe lamp equipped with a UV cutoff filter ( 420 nm) was employed as the light source.First, 10 mg powder photocatalyst was added in the autoclave of 20 mL distilled water.Second, the autoclave was heated to 80 C by the circulating water from a thermostatic bath, and then vacuumized and filled with CO 2 (99.999) several times to remove the air.Third, 0.6 MPa CO 2 gas was injected into the autoclave and kept in the dark of 30 min to reach adsorptiondesorption equilibrium between the catalyst and CO 2 .Finally, the reaction was carried out under the condition of light illumination and magnetic stirring for 7 h.After that, the reactor was cooled to 25 C. The suspension (2 mL) was gathered and centrifuged in order to remove the particles.The liquid product was analyzed by the gas chromatograph (GC 9860) with a flame ionization detector (FID), a capillary column (PEG-20M, 30 m 0.32 mm 0.5 m) and a headspace autosampler (AHS-12A).The quantum yield for CH 3 OH production was measured in the same process except that a Xe lamp with the wavelength of 420 nm was used as the light source."}, {"llm generation": "UV-Vis", "source": "Photocatalytic performance of as-prepared samples for CO 2 reduction are evaluated at 0.6 MPa and 80 C in the presence of water under visible light irradiation.", "context": "Initially, the XRD patterns of g-C 3 N 4 , NiTiO 3 and NiTiO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composites with different NiTiO 3 contents are carried out.As depicted in Fig. 1a, the two characteristic peaks of g-C 3 N 4 at 13.3 and 27.4 are assigned to (1 0 0) and (0 0 2) crystal planes, representing the in-plane structural packing motif of condensed tri-s-triazine units and the interlayer structural stacking of conjugated aromatic CN segments, respectively 38394041.For pure NiTiO 3 , all diffraction peaks can be indexed to crystal planes of NiTiO 3 phase (JCPDS no.33-0960) and no other phases are observed.When combining the two semiconductors, the characteristic diffraction peaks of the heterostructured composites do not change greatly and no other possible impurity peaks are detected in the XRD patterns.The relative peak intensity of NiTiO 3 is enhanced with the increase of nickel titanate loading onto the g-C 3 N 4 .This could be ascribed to the effect of composition variation in similar composites on the relative diffraction peak intensity. The XRD results could be further proved by FT-IR spectra (Fig. 1b).As to g-C 3 N 4 , the peaks at 1244 cm -1 , 1318 cm -1 , 1408 cm -1 , 1461 cm -1 , 1574 cm -1 and 1640 cm -1 are assigned to the stretching vibration of C-N heterocycles and C--N stretching vibration mode 42,43.The peak under 809 cm -1 is identified as the breathing vibration of triazine ring 44.For NiTiO 3 , the peaks at 452 cm -1 , 563 cm -1 and 660 cm -1 are stretching vibrations of Ti-O-Ni, Ni-O and Ti-O bonds 37,454647.In the case of NT/GCN, all characteristic peaks of g-C 3 N 4 and NiTiO 3 are also maintained, suggesting that the composite is composed of g-C 3 N 4 and NiTiO 3 , and correspond to the XRD results. Then the TEM and HRTEM are performed to intuitively investigate the morphologies and microstructures of as-synthesized materials, further confirming the formation of NiTiO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composites.The g-C 3 N 4 is made up of different 2D crystal layers with smooth surfaces (Fig. 2a) and the NiTiO 3 is composed of a rod-like structure formed by the aggregation of nanoparticles and a small number of unaggregated and dispersed nanoparticles (Fig. 2b and Fig. S2a).After introducing NiTiO 3 into g-C 3 N 4 , both rod-shaped NiTiO 3 and dispersed NiTiO 3 nanoparticles anchor on the surface of g-C 3 N 4 , thus forming heterojunction (Fig. 2c,d and Fig. S2b).From Fig. 2d, the high crystallinity NiTiO 3 nanoparticles could be notarized by the lattice spacing of 0.25 nm that matches the NiTiO 3 (1 1 0) crystal plane, and the g-C 3 N 4 presents the honeycomb-like porous structure due to its polymer nature.Moreover, a distinct interface with a clear boundary between NiTiO and g-C 3 N 4 is observed, indicating the formation of NiTiO 3 /g-C 3 N heterojunction.From the HRTEM-mapping, the elements C, N, Ni, Ti and O are all detected in NT/GCN40 (Fig. S3).There is no doubt that the intimate heterojunction interface connection is crucial for effective charge transfer. The UV-vis absorption spectra could be used to test the photophysical property of the samples (Fig. 3).The absorption edges of NiTiO and g-C 3 N 4 are about 446 (Eg 2.78 eV) and 462 nm (Eg 2.68 eV), respectively.After assembling NT/GCN heterojunction, the absorption edge of NT/GCN40 is almost the same as that of g-C 3 N 4 , but the UV-vis light response is stronger than that of g-C 3 N 4 .This may be beneficial to the utilization of visible light, thus contributing to the improvement of the photoactivity. The E CB and E VB potentials of g-C 3 N 4 and NiTiO 3 can be calculated using Mulliken electronegativity theory 48: where E CB and E VB are the conduction and valence band potentials, respectively.E c is the energy of a free electron vs. hydrogen (4.5 eV).X and E g are the absolute electronegativity and band gap energy of the semiconductor, respectively.The absolute electronegativity (X) of g-C 3 N 4 and NiTiO 3 are reported to be 4.72 eV and 5.79 eV, respectively 48,49.A simplified calculation estimates the E CB and E VB to be -1.12eV and 1.56 eV for g-C 3 N 4 and -0.1 eV and 2.68 eV for NiTiO 3 . The elemental composition, chemical state and interfacial interaction between g-C 3 N 4 and NiTiO 3 are measured by XPS.As shown in Fig. 4a, the survey spectrum reveals the presence of C, N, Ti, Ni and O elements in NT/GCN hybrid.In Fig. 4b, the two peaks at 284.80 and 288.30eV belong to the C 1s, corresponding to the sp 2 C--C bonds and the sp 2 -bonded C (N-C--N) 50.The N 1s spectra of g-C 3 N 4 (Fig. 4c) can be deconvoluted into three peaks at 398.90, 400.75 and 404.70 eV, which are ascribed to the triazine ring (C-N--C), the tertiary nitrogen N-(C) 3 group and the positive charge localization in heterocycles or excitations 51,52.For the Ni 2p spectrum of NiTiO 3 (Fig. 4d), the peaks at binding energies of 855.6 and 873.2 eV are related to Ni 2p 3/2 and Ni 2p 1/2 of Ni 2 .The broad satellite peaks at 861.8 eV and 879.9 eV are characteristic of divalent Ni (Ni 2 ) 53.The position of Ti 2p 3/2 and Ti 2p 1/2 lines at 458.30 eV and 464.05 eV are assigned to the Ti 4 oxidation state 53,54.In Fig. 4f, the peak at 530.10 eV (O IV peak) of O 1s corresponds to NiTiO 3 53.After the combination of NiTiO 3 and g-C 3 N 4 (like NT/GCN40), the C 1s and N 1s peaks of NT/GCN display a decreased binding energy, while the peaks of Ni 2p, Ti 2p and O 1s exhibit an increased binding energy.Such results could be owed to the strong interaction between NiTiO 3 and g-C 3 N 4 .In a theoretical manner, increased electron concentration results in the decrease of binding energy due to the promoted electron shielding effect, whereas decreased electron concentration induces the increase of binding energy because of the weakened electron shielding effect 55,56.Therefore, the change in binding energy indicates the electron transfer occurs at the NT/GCN hybrid interface, concretely, the electrons move from NiTiO 3 to g-C 3 N 4 , which gives a strong proof for the Z-scheme charge migration pathway at the interface of NT/GCN heterostructure. Furthermore, the element content of NT/GCN40 is calculated using XPS and shown in Table 1.The weight percentages of different elements in NT/GCN40 are closed to the stoichiometric ratio.The above findings confirm the successful preparation of Z-scheme NiTiO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 nanocomposite. Photocatalytic performance of as-prepared samples for CO 2 reduction are evaluated at 0.6 MPa and 80 C in the presence of water under visible light irradiation.The photocatalytic experiment with 5 mg, 10 mg and 15 mg of g-C 3 N 4 is performed in 20 mL of distilled water, and the corresponding CH 3 OH yield are 3.13, 4.18 and 3.56 molg -1 h -1 (Fig. S4).Initially, the solution is light yellow, and the increase of g-C 3 N 4 dosage is beneficial to the improvement of CH 3 OH yield.However, when the g-C 3 N 4 dosage reaches 15 mg, light could not penetrate the dark yellow solution easily, resulting in less photons being absorbed by the photocatalyst at the bottom of the reactor, thus affecting the improvement of the overall catalytic efficiency.Therefore, the catalyst dosage is 10 mg for all reactions.The control experiments are conducted without CO 2 , photocatalyst or light.As shown in Fig. S5, no product can be detected in the absence of irradiation or photocatalyst, indicating that effective illumination and photocatalysis are two essential factors in the photocatalytic process.Further control experiment is performed by using N 2 instead of CO 2 in the autoclave.No product is yielded after illumination for 7 h, suggesting that CH 3 OH solely originates from CO photoreduction. Fig. 5 shows the comparison of average CH 3 OH evolution rates of different photocatalysts.In detail, no CH 3 OH is detected over NiTiO because the E CB (-0.1 eV) of NiTiO 3 is more positive than the reduction potential of CO 2 /CH 3 OH (-0.38 eV).The pure g-C 3 N 4 shows a low CH 3 OH yield of 4.18 molg -1 h -1 , most likely due to the rapid electron-hole recombination.After coupling with NiTiO 3 to form NT/ GCN heterostructure, a significant increase of CH 3 OH evolution is achieved.The intimate interfacial interaction between NiTiO 3 and g-C 3 N could facilitate the separation and migration of photoinduced electronhole pairs.The CH 3 OH yield over NT/GCN composites increases with the increase of NiTiO 3 content, achieving a maximum of 13.74 molg -1 h -1 over NT/GCN40, which is 3.29 times higher than that of g-C 3 N 4 .When the NiTiO 3 content is increased to 60 and further increased to 80, the excess NiTiO 3 might result in a decrease in the efficient heterojunction interface between NiTiO 3 and g-C 3 N 4 , which would reduce the transfer and separation efficiency of photoinduced holes and electrons, thus reducing the photoactivity.The above results show that the heterojunction is beneficial to the improvement of the photocatalytic activity and the CH 3 OH production of g-C 3 N 4 is significantly increased after coupling with NiTiO 3 even though NiTiO 3 cannot reduce CO 2 to CH 3 OH. From Table S1, the CH 3 OH yield of NT/GCN40 is higher than the reported g-C 3 N 4 -based photocatalysts 12,13,57585960.However, all the photocatalysts exhibit reduced reactivity when the reaction temperature is reduced to 20 C, and the CH 3 OH yield of NT/GCN40 is only 5.64 molg -1 h -1 (Fig. S6).This may be because with lower temperature, the less energy will be produced, causing the slower molecular movement, which is not conducive to CH 3 OH formation.Besides, the effect of initial CO 2 concentration on CH 3 OH evolution is studied (Fig. S7).As the initial CO 2 concentration decreases, the CH 3 OH evolution rate gradually decreases.This may be because lower CO 2 concentration results in less CO 2 dissolving in water, which could reduce the amount of CO 2 involved in the reaction, thus reducing the photoactivity.From Fig. S8, the CH 3 OH yield of g-C 3 N 4 and NT/GCN40 increases linearly with time.After 5 h of reaction, the CH 3 OH yield of NT/GCN40 reaches 67.91 molg -1 , which is 3.36 times higher than that of g-C 3 N 4 .This result is comparable to the previous average CH 3 OH evolution rates for g-C 3 N and NT/GCN40.In order to better understand and compare the photocatalytic performance of different catalysts, the quantum yield (QY) of g-C 3 N 4 and NT/GCN40 is calculated according to Eq. ( 3) 59. The QY for CH 3 OH is tested using 6 electrons under the irradiation of wavelength 420 nm and light intensity 20 mWcm -2 .The summary of QY of g-C 3 N 4 and NT/GCN40 are shown in Table 2.The QY value of NT/ GCN40 is calculated to be 0.03385, which is 3.38 times over that of g-C 3 N 4 .This apparent increase in QY is due to the efficient photoinduced electrons/holes transfer with suppressed recombination rate between NiTiO 3 and g-C 3 N 4 . Apart from photocatalytic activity, the material reusability is also very important for practical applications.So, the recycling experiment of NT/GCN40 composite is investigated in four runs.As shown in Fig. 6a, no obvious decrease in CH 3 OH evolution is observed during four cycles, suggesting the good stability of NT/GCN40.Moreover, the XRD result of used NT/GCN40 remains the identical crystal structure, further confirming its excellent structural stability. The specific surface area (S BET ) and porosity of g-C 3 N 4 , NiTiO 3 and NT/GCN40 are measured by N 2 adsorption-desorption analysis.As displayed in Fig. 7a, the curve shape of the samples belongs to type IV with H3 hysteresis loop in the range of 0.8-1.0P/P 0, confirming the mesoporous and macroporous properties 61.The pore diameter distribution (Fig. 7b) is calculated by BJH method.For g-C 3 N 4 , the S BET and pore size are 9.91 m 2 g -1 and 13.99 nm, respectively.After the loading of NiTiO 3 , the S BET is improved significantly, whereas the pore size is almost unchanged (Table 3).As is known to all, catalysts with higher S BET could provide more active sites, thus improving the catalytic performance.We perform CO 2 -TPD measurements to investigate the surface active sites of CO 2 adsorption.As shown in Fig. 7c, the desorption of CO 2 adsorbed on the materials shows a peak at the range of 50-200 C, which is attributed to the physical absorption 62,63.Compared with g-C 3 N 4 , the amount of CO 2 desorption of NT/GCN40 is increased, indicating that the introduction of NiTiO 3 could provide more opportunities for CO 2 to react with NT/GCN40.The photoelectrochemical measurements and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy are executed to investigate the photoinduced e -/h separation and transfer processes in the composite.Fig. 8a shows the periodic on/off i-t curve of g-C 3 N 4 and NT/GCN composites.It is obvious that the photocurrent density of NT/GCN composites are much higher than g-C 3 N 4 , indicating the faster charge separation and migration rate on the NT/GCN composites.The concordant conclusion is verified by EIS measurements (Fig. 8b).Generally, the smaller radius indicates the higher interfacial charge transfer and separation efficiency 64.Among these samples, the Nyquist diagram of NT/GCN40 exhibits the smallest semicircle, indicating the lowest charge transfer resistance.To further decipher the charge transfer and recombination process between NiTiO 3 and g-C 3 N 4 , the PL spectroscopy is conducted (Fig. 8c).The g-C 3 N 4 exhibits the strongest peak intensity, which indicates the rapid recombination of the photoinduced e -and h pairs.After g-C 3 N 4 is combined with NiTiO 3 , the peak intensities of all composites are reduced.This decrease could be attributed to the heterojunction formation between g-C 3 N 4 and NiTiO 3 , which results in efficient charge carriers transfer and separation that can inhibit the recombination of the photoinduced e - and h pairs.The PL signal decreased in the following order, g-C 3 N 4 NT/GCN80 NT/GCN20 NT/GCN60 NT/GCN40, which is consistent with the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction results. The time-resolved transient PL decays spectra is carried out to get further information on the interfacial charge carriers transfer behavior (Fig. 8d).The decay curves can be fitted with a double-exponential function as follow 65. where A is a constant, B 1 and B 2 are constants associated with the nonradiative and radiative relaxation processes, respectively. 1 is related to the nonradiative relaxation process and 2 is related to the radiative process of direct recombination of photogenerated charge carriers.The average carrier lifetime () is calculated according to Eq. ( 3) Fitted parameters are listed in Table S2 and NT/GCN40 shows an average lifetime of 4.19 ns, which is longer than that of g-C 3 N 4 (3.71 ns).This indicates that the intimate interfaces formed in NT/GCN40 heterojunction can slow down the recombination of charge carriers due to the heterojunction electric field. Based on the above experimental results, we assume that NT/GCN composites follow the Z-scheme structure mechanism instead of the conventional type-II heterojunction mechanism.If the photogenerated charge transfer follows the conventional type-II heterojunction mechanism, the holes on VB of NiTiO 3 will transfer to VB of g-C 3 N 4 , and the electrons will migrate from CB of g-C 3 N 4 to that of NiTiO 3 .However, NiTiO 3 is not able to reduce CO 2 to CH 3 OH because the E CB of NiTiO (-0.1 eV) is more positive than the reduction potential of CO 2 /CH 3 OH (-0.38 eV).In contrast, if the photogenerated charge transfer follows Zscheme mechanism, e -on CB of NiTiO 3 will move directly to VB of g-C 3 N 4 and combine with h , leaving e -on CB of g-C 3 N 4 to react with CO to form CH 3 OH, and h on VB of NiTiO 3 to participate in water oxidation reaction.This spatially separated photocatalytic system has efficient charge separation, so as to achieve high photocatalytic performance. To further verify the aforementioned Z-scheme mechanism, the ESR analysis is performed to detect OH and O 2 -species by using DMPO as a spin trap.As shown in Fig. 9a, the characteristic peaks with the intensity ratio of 1:2:2:1 belonging to DMPO/OH adduct can be clearly seen in Therefore, a direct Z-scheme migration mechanism is fabricated, as illustrated in Fig. 10.Under irradiation, the excited e -on CB of NiTiO 3 migrate to the interface to combine with excited h on VB of g-C 3 N 4 .This can dramatically suppress the recombination of carriers and lead to the accumulation of h and e -on VB of NiTiO 3 and CB of g-C 3 N 4 , respectively.Thus, more photoelectrons are retained on CB of g-C 3 N 4 , resulting in a 3.29-fold increase in the activity of CO 2 photoreduction."}], "lamp": [{"llm generation": "Xenon", "source": "A 300 W Xe lamp equipped with a UV cutoff filter ( 420 nm) was employed as the light source.", "context": "The g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets were fabricated by a thermal treatment of dicyandiamide according to our previous report 11.In a typical process, 2 g of dicyandiamide in an alumina crucible with a lid was put in a muffle furnace and heated to 550 C for 4 h with a heating rate of 2 Cmin -1 .After cooling to room temperature, the yellow product was ground into fine power.500 mg of the as-obtained product was added into the mixed solution of 1 mL acetic acid and 25 mL distilled water.Next, the above suspension was stirred for 4 h and then ultrasonicated for 2 h.The sample was collected by centrifugation, washed several times using ethanol and distilled water, and dried in a vacuum oven at 80 C for 12 h.

The photocurrent response and electrochemistry impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis were conducted on an electrochemical analyzer (CHI 760E) in a three-electrode system with Pt wire as a counter electrode, Ag/AgCl as a reference electrode and the photocatalyst as a working electrode.The working electrode was prepared as follows: mg photocatalyst was dispersed in 30 uL nafion and 1 mL ethanol, and then the mixture was treated with sonication for 1 h to make a slurry.

The experiments of CO 2 photoreduction in the presence of H 2 O were performed in a 100 mL autoclave (Anhui Kemi Machinery Technology Co., Ltd, China) with a quartz window (Fig. S1).The temperature of the reactor was controlled by the circulating water passing through the jacketed wall.A 300 W Xe lamp equipped with a UV cutoff filter ( 420 nm) was employed as the light source.First, 10 mg powder photocatalyst was added in the autoclave of 20 mL distilled water.Second, the autoclave was heated to 80 C by the circulating water from a thermostatic bath, and then vacuumized and filled with CO 2 (99.999) several times to remove the air.Third, 0.6 MPa CO 2 gas was injected into the autoclave and kept in the dark of 30 min to reach adsorptiondesorption equilibrium between the catalyst and CO 2 .Finally, the reaction was carried out under the condition of light illumination and magnetic stirring for 7 h.After that, the reactor was cooled to 25 C.

The XRD results could be further proved by FT-IR spectra (Fig. 1b).As to g-C 3 N 4 , the peaks at 1244 cm -1 , 1318 cm -1 , 1408 cm -1 , 1461 cm -1 , 1574 cm -1 and 1640 cm -1 are assigned to the stretching vibration of C-N heterocycles and C--N stretching vibration mode 42,43.The peak under 809 cm -1 is identified as the breathing vibration of triazine ring 44.For NiTiO 3 , the peaks at 452 cm -1 , 563 cm -1 and 660 cm -1 are stretching vibrations of Ti-O-Ni, Ni-O and Ti-O bonds 37,454647.In the case of NT/GCN, all characteristic peaks of g-C 3 N 4 and NiTiO 3 are also maintained, suggesting that the composite is composed of g-C 3 N 4 and NiTiO 3 , and correspond to the XRD results. Then the TEM and HRTEM are performed to intuitively investigate the morphologies and microstructures of as-synthesized materials, further confirming the formation of NiTiO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composites.The g-C 3 N 4 is made up of different 2D crystal layers with smooth surfaces (Fig. 2a) and the NiTiO 3 is composed of a rod-like structure formed by the aggregation of nanoparticles and a small number of unaggregated and dispersed nanoparticles (Fig. 2b and Fig. S2a).After introducing NiTiO 3 into g-C 3 N 4 , both rod-shaped NiTiO 3 and dispersed NiTiO 3 nanoparticles anchor on the surface of g-C 3 N 4 , thus forming heterojunction (Fig. 2c,d and Fig. S2b).From Fig. 2d, the high crystallinity NiTiO 3 nanoparticles could be notarized by the lattice spacing of 0.25 nm that matches the NiTiO 3 (1 1 0) crystal plane, and the g-C 3 N 4 presents the honeycomb-like porous structure due to its polymer nature.Moreover, a distinct interface with a clear boundary between NiTiO and g-C 3 N 4 is observed, indicating the formation of NiTiO 3 /g-C 3 N heterojunction.From the HRTEM-mapping, the elements C, N, Ni, Ti and O are all detected in NT/GCN40 (Fig. S3).There is no doubt that the intimate heterojunction interface connection is crucial for effective charge transfer. The UV-vis absorption spectra could be used to test the photophysical property of the samples (Fig. 3).The absorption edges of NiTiO and g-C 3 N 4 are about 446 (Eg 2.78 eV) and 462 nm (Eg 2.68 eV), respectively.After assembling NT/GCN heterojunction, the absorption edge of NT/GCN40 is almost the same as that of g-C 3 N 4 , but the UV-vis light response is stronger than that of g-C 3 N 4 .This may be beneficial to the utilization of visible light, thus contributing to the improvement of the photoactivity. The E CB and E VB potentials of g-C 3 N 4 and NiTiO 3 can be calculated using Mulliken electronegativity theory 48: where E CB and E VB are the conduction and valence band potentials, respectively.E c is the energy of a free electron vs. hydrogen (4.5 eV).X and E g are the absolute electronegativity and band gap energy of the semiconductor, respectively.The absolute electronegativity (X) of g-C 3 N 4 and NiTiO 3 are reported to be 4.72 eV and 5.79 eV, respectively 48,49.A simplified calculation estimates the E CB and E VB to be -1.12eV and 1.56 eV for g-C 3 N 4 and -0.1 eV and 2.68 eV for NiTiO 3 . The elemental composition, chemical state and interfacial interaction between g-C 3 N 4 and NiTiO 3 are measured by XPS.As shown in Fig. 4a, the survey spectrum reveals the presence of C, N, Ti, Ni and O elements in NT/GCN hybrid.In Fig. 4b, the two peaks at 284.80 and 288.30eV belong to the C 1s, corresponding to the sp 2 C--C bonds and the sp 2 -bonded C (N-C--N) 50.The N 1s spectra of g-C 3 N 4 (Fig. 4c) can be deconvoluted into three peaks at 398.90, 400.75 and 404.70 eV, which are ascribed to the triazine ring (C-N--C), the tertiary nitrogen N-(C) 3 group and the positive charge localization in heterocycles or excitations 51,52.For the Ni 2p spectrum of NiTiO 3 (Fig. 4d), the peaks at binding energies of 855.6 and 873.2 eV are related to Ni 2p 3/2 and Ni 2p 1/2 of Ni 2 .The broad satellite peaks at 861.8 eV and 879.9 eV are characteristic of divalent Ni (Ni 2 ) 53.The position of Ti 2p 3/2 and Ti 2p 1/2 lines at 458.30 eV and 464.05 eV are assigned to the Ti 4 oxidation state 53,54.In Fig. 4f, the peak at 530.10 eV (O IV peak) of O 1s corresponds to NiTiO 3 53.After the combination of NiTiO 3 and g-C 3 N 4 (like NT/GCN40), the C 1s and N 1s peaks of NT/GCN display a decreased binding energy, while the peaks of Ni 2p, Ti 2p and O 1s exhibit an increased binding energy.Such results could be owed to the strong interaction between NiTiO 3 and g-C 3 N 4 .In a theoretical manner, increased electron concentration results in the decrease of binding energy due to the promoted electron shielding effect, whereas decreased electron concentration induces the increase of binding energy because of the weakened electron shielding effect 55,56.Therefore, the change in binding energy indicates the electron transfer occurs at the NT/GCN hybrid interface, concretely, the electrons move from NiTiO 3 to g-C 3 N 4 , which gives a strong proof for the Z-scheme charge migration pathway at the interface of NT/GCN heterostructure. Furthermore, the element content of NT/GCN40 is calculated using XPS and shown in Table 1.The weight percentages of different elements in NT/GCN40 are closed to the stoichiometric ratio.The above findings confirm the successful preparation of Z-scheme NiTiO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 nanocomposite. Photocatalytic performance of as-prepared samples for CO 2 reduction are evaluated at 0.6 MPa and 80 C in the presence of water under visible light irradiation.The photocatalytic experiment with 5 mg, 10 mg and 15 mg of g-C 3 N 4 is performed in 20 mL of distilled water, and the corresponding CH 3 OH yield are 3.13, 4.18 and 3.56 molg -1 h -1 (Fig. S4).Initially, the solution is light yellow, and the increase of g-C 3 N 4 dosage is beneficial to the improvement of CH 3 OH yield.However, when the g-C 3 N 4 dosage reaches 15 mg, light could not penetrate the dark yellow solution easily, resulting in less photons being absorbed by the photocatalyst at the bottom of the reactor, thus affecting the improvement of the overall catalytic efficiency.Therefore, the catalyst dosage is 10 mg for all reactions.The control experiments are conducted without CO 2 , photocatalyst or light.As shown in Fig. S5, no product can be detected in the absence of irradiation or photocatalyst, indicating that effective illumination and photocatalysis are two essential factors in the photocatalytic process.Further control experiment is performed by using N 2 instead of CO 2 in the autoclave.No product is yielded after illumination for 7 h, suggesting that CH 3 OH solely originates from CO photoreduction. Fig. 5 shows the comparison of average CH 3 OH evolution rates of different photocatalysts.In detail, no CH 3 OH is detected over NiTiO because the E CB (-0.1 eV) of NiTiO 3 is more positive than the reduction potential of CO 2 /CH 3 OH (-0.38 eV).The pure g-C 3 N 4 shows a low CH 3 OH yield of 4.18 molg -1 h -1 , most likely due to the rapid electron-hole recombination.After coupling with NiTiO 3 to form NT/ GCN heterostructure, a significant increase of CH 3 OH evolution is achieved.The intimate interfacial interaction between NiTiO 3 and g-C 3 N could facilitate the separation and migration of photoinduced electronhole pairs.The CH 3 OH yield over NT/GCN composites increases with the increase of NiTiO 3 content, achieving a maximum of 13.74 molg -1 h -1 over NT/GCN40, which is 3.29 times higher than that of g-C 3 N 4 .When the NiTiO 3 content is increased to 60 and further increased to 80, the excess NiTiO 3 might result in a decrease in the efficient heterojunction interface between NiTiO 3 and g-C 3 N 4 , which would reduce the transfer and separation efficiency of photoinduced holes and electrons, thus reducing the photoactivity.The above results show that the heterojunction is beneficial to the improvement of the photocatalytic activity and the CH 3 OH production of g-C 3 N 4 is significantly increased after coupling with NiTiO 3 even though NiTiO 3 cannot reduce CO 2 to CH 3 OH. From Table S1, the CH 3 OH yield of NT/GCN40 is higher than the reported g-C 3 N 4 -based photocatalysts 12,13,57585960.However, all the photocatalysts exhibit reduced reactivity when the reaction temperature is reduced to 20 C, and the CH 3 OH yield of NT/GCN40 is only 5.64 molg -1 h -1 (Fig. S6).This may be because with lower temperature, the less energy will be produced, causing the slower molecular movement, which is not conducive to CH 3 OH formation.Besides, the effect of initial CO 2 concentration on CH 3 OH evolution is studied (Fig. S7).As the initial CO 2 concentration decreases, the CH 3 OH evolution rate gradually decreases.This may be because lower CO 2 concentration results in less CO 2 dissolving in water, which could reduce the amount of CO 2 involved in the reaction, thus reducing the photoactivity.From Fig. S8, the CH 3 OH yield of g-C 3 N 4 and NT/GCN40 increases linearly with time.After 5 h of reaction, the CH 3 OH yield of NT/GCN40 reaches 67.91 molg -1 , which is 3.36 times higher than that of g-C 3 N 4 .This result is comparable to the previous average CH 3 OH evolution rates for g-C 3 N and NT/GCN40.In order to better understand and compare the photocatalytic performance of different catalysts, the quantum yield (QY) of g-C 3 N 4 and NT/GCN40 is calculated according to Eq. ( 3) 59. The QY for CH 3 OH is tested using 6 electrons under the irradiation of wavelength 420 nm and light intensity 20 mWcm -2 .The summary of QY of g-C 3 N 4 and NT/GCN40 are shown in Table 2.The QY value of NT/ GCN40 is calculated to be 0.03385, which is 3.38 times over that of g-C 3 N 4 .This apparent increase in QY is due to the efficient photoinduced electrons/holes transfer with suppressed recombination rate between NiTiO 3 and g-C 3 N 4 . Apart from photocatalytic activity, the material reusability is also very important for practical applications.So, the recycling experiment of NT/GCN40 composite is investigated in four runs.As shown in Fig. 6a, no obvious decrease in CH 3 OH evolution is observed during four cycles, suggesting the good stability of NT/GCN40.Moreover, the XRD result of used NT/GCN40 remains the identical crystal structure, further confirming its excellent structural stability. The specific surface area (S BET ) and porosity of g-C 3 N 4 , NiTiO 3 and NT/GCN40 are measured by N 2 adsorption-desorption analysis.As displayed in Fig. 7a, the curve shape of the samples belongs to type IV with H3 hysteresis loop in the range of 0.8-1.0P/P 0, confirming the mesoporous and macroporous properties 61.The pore diameter distribution (Fig. 7b) is calculated by BJH method.For g-C 3 N 4 , the S BET and pore size are 9.91 m 2 g -1 and 13.99 nm, respectively.After the loading of NiTiO 3 , the S BET is improved significantly, whereas the pore size is almost unchanged (Table 3).As is known to all, catalysts with higher S BET could provide more active sites, thus improving the catalytic performance.We perform CO 2 -TPD measurements to investigate the surface active sites of CO 2 adsorption.As shown in Fig. 7c, the desorption of CO 2 adsorbed on the materials shows a peak at the range of 50-200 C, which is attributed to the physical absorption 62,63.Compared with g-C 3 N 4 , the amount of CO 2 desorption of NT/GCN40 is increased, indicating that the introduction of NiTiO 3 could provide more opportunities for CO 2 to react with NT/GCN40.The photoelectrochemical measurements and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy are executed to investigate the photoinduced e -/h separation and transfer processes in the composite.Fig. 8a shows the periodic on/off i-t curve of g-C 3 N 4 and NT/GCN composites.It is obvious that the photocurrent density of NT/GCN composites are much higher than g-C 3 N 4 , indicating the faster charge separation and migration rate on the NT/GCN composites.The concordant conclusion is verified by EIS measurements (Fig. 8b).Generally, the smaller radius indicates the higher interfacial charge transfer and separation efficiency 64.Among these samples, the Nyquist diagram of NT/GCN40 exhibits the smallest semicircle, indicating the lowest charge transfer resistance.To further decipher the charge transfer and recombination process between NiTiO 3 and g-C 3 N 4 , the PL spectroscopy is conducted (Fig. 8c).The g-C 3 N 4 exhibits the strongest peak intensity, which indicates the rapid recombination of the photoinduced e -and h pairs.After g-C 3 N 4 is combined with NiTiO 3 , the peak intensities of all composites are reduced.This decrease could be attributed to the heterojunction formation between g-C 3 N 4 and NiTiO 3 , which results in efficient charge carriers transfer and separation that can inhibit the recombination of the photoinduced e - and h pairs.The PL signal decreased in the following order, g-C 3 N 4 NT/GCN80 NT/GCN20 NT/GCN60 NT/GCN40, which is consistent with the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction results. The time-resolved transient PL decays spectra is carried out to get further information on the interfacial charge carriers transfer behavior (Fig. 8d).The decay curves can be fitted with a double-exponential function as follow 65. where A is a constant, B 1 and B 2 are constants associated with the nonradiative and radiative relaxation processes, respectively. 1 is related to the nonradiative relaxation process and 2 is related to the radiative process of direct recombination of photogenerated charge carriers.The average carrier lifetime () is calculated according to Eq. ( 3) Fitted parameters are listed in Table S2 and NT/GCN40 shows an average lifetime of 4.19 ns, which is longer than that of g-C 3 N 4 (3.71 ns).This indicates that the intimate interfaces formed in NT/GCN40 heterojunction can slow down the recombination of charge carriers due to the heterojunction electric field. Based on the above experimental results, we assume that NT/GCN composites follow the Z-scheme structure mechanism instead of the conventional type-II heterojunction mechanism.If the photogenerated charge transfer follows the conventional type-II heterojunction mechanism, the holes on VB of NiTiO 3 will transfer to VB of g-C 3 N 4 , and the electrons will migrate from CB of g-C 3 N 4 to that of NiTiO 3 .However, NiTiO 3 is not able to reduce CO 2 to CH 3 OH because the E CB of NiTiO (-0.1 eV) is more positive than the reduction potential of CO 2 /CH 3 OH (-0.38 eV).In contrast, if the photogenerated charge transfer follows Zscheme mechanism, e -on CB of NiTiO 3 will move directly to VB of g-C 3 N 4 and combine with h , leaving e -on CB of g-C 3 N 4 to react with CO to form CH 3 OH, and h on VB of NiTiO 3 to participate in water oxidation reaction.This spatially separated photocatalytic system has efficient charge separation, so as to achieve high photocatalytic performance. To further verify the aforementioned Z-scheme mechanism, the ESR analysis is performed to detect OH and O 2 -species by using DMPO as a spin trap.As shown in Fig. 9a, the characteristic peaks with the intensity ratio of 1:2:2:1 belonging to DMPO/OH adduct can be clearly seen in Therefore, a direct Z-scheme migration mechanism is fabricated, as illustrated in Fig. 10.Under irradiation, the excited e -on CB of NiTiO 3 migrate to the interface to combine with excited h on VB of g-C 3 N 4 .This can dramatically suppress the recombination of carriers and lead to the accumulation of h and e -on VB of NiTiO 3 and CB of g-C 3 N 4 , respectively.Thus, more photoelectrons are retained on CB of g-C 3 N 4 , resulting in a 3.29-fold increase in the activity of CO 2 photoreduction."}], "reactor type": [], "operation mode": []}}
