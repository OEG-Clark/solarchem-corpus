Fig. 1A displays a typical SEM image of the prepared MIL-68(In) submicro-rods.These particles exhibit a distinct rod-like appearance with an average diameter of ca.300 nm and length up to 4 lm.TEM reveals that these MIL-68(In) submicro-rods have a cylindrical-shaped structure and their surface is smooth (inset of Fig. 1A).XRD patterns of these submicro-rods are well consistent with the simulated XRD peaks of MIL-68(In) crystal (see Fig. S1), confirming that these particles are indeed MIL-68(In) crystals.When Mn 2 ions were loaded in MIL-68(In) and reacted with thiourea, the final product still maintained a rod-like morphology Scheme 1. Schematic illustration of the synthetic process for MnS/In 2 S 3 heterojuctions using MIL-68(In) as template.(Fig. 1B).However, the particle surface is obviously different from MIL-68(In) and many nanosheets could be observed on their surface.At the same time, the inner side of these rods is hollow, exhibiting a hierarchical tubular structure (inset of Fig. 1B).This structural feature can be further confirmed by magnified TEM images (see Fig. S2).Two sets of XRD patterns appeared in the final product (see Fig. S3), in which one set of peaks could be indexed to hexagonal c-MnS (JCPDS card No. 40-1289) while the other set of XRD peaks belong to cubic b-In 2 S 3 (JCPDS card No. 65-0459).The XRD patterns confirm that the product is composed of two types of nanocrystals, namely c-MnS and b-In 2 S 3 .To determine the distribution of MnS and In 2 S 3 in each submicro-tubes, we performed elemental mappings on the hierarchical particle (Fig. 1C).Interestingly, we observed that S, In, Mn elements were all well distributed throughout the hierarchical structures, indicating that plenty of small MnS and In 2 S 3 nanocrystals were formed inside the particle.This phenomenon is attributed to the fact that both In 3 and Mn 2 ions were evenly distributed inside the Mn 2 -loaded MIL-68(In) submicro-rods, providing a homogeneous environment to build plenty of MnS/In 2 S 3 heterojunctions in each particle.Clear lattice fringes from MnS and In 2 S 3 could be clearly observed under HRTEM (see Fig. 1D).The lattice spacing of 0.26 nm and 0.32 nm are ascribed to the (0 0 2) plane of c-MnS and the (3 1 1) plane of b-In 2 S 3 , respectively. To assess whether the band structures of MnS and In 2 S 3 are suitable for building efficient heterojunction for photocatalytic applications, we employed DRS to investigate their optimal bandgaps.Pristine In 2 S 3 nanosheets with a hierarchical structure were also prepared by directly using MIL-68(In) submicro-rods as precursor without the loading of Mn 2 ions (see Fig. S4A andS4B).For comparison, MnS nanoparticles were also prepared under a similar condition without the use of MIL-68(In) precursor (see Fig. S4C andS4D).The DRS data (Fig. 2A and2B) show that both In 2 S 3 and MnS have a distinct absorption in the visible range.In the DRS of MnS, two absorption peaks above 500 nm also appeared in addition to the band edge absorption.This is due to the transitions between partially occupied 3d states of Mn 2 ions 56,57.Using corresponding Tauc plots (insets of Fig. 2A and2B), the optical band gaps of In 2 S 3 and MnS were estimated to be 2.15 eV and 2.68 eV, respectively. Flatband potentials (E fb ) of In 2 S 3 and MnS were further determined by MAS method.The positive slop implies that In 2 S 3 is an n-type SC while the negative slop of MnS suggests that it belongs to p-type SCs (Fig. 2C and2D).These results are consistent with previous researches 58,59.Considering that the E fb is generally about 0.1 eV below the conduction band minimum (CBM) of ntype SCs or 0.1 eV above the valence band maximum (VBM) of ptype SCs 60,61, the CBM position of In 2 S 3 is estimated to be A0.42 V and the VBM position of MnS is about 1.52 V. On the basis of the measured bandgaps and CBM/VBM positions, band structures of MnS and In 2 S 3 are illustrated in Fig. 2E.Obviously, a p-n heterojunction with a staggered energy level alignment can be expected between MnS and In 2 S 3 .The hierarchical tubular structure can enable plenty of MnS/In 2 S 3 p-n heterojunctions assembled in one particle. The surface compositions and binding environment of MnS/ In 2 S 3 (30 wt) heterojunction were further investigated by XPS.In the XPS survey spectrum, distinct signals from Mn, In, S elements could all be detected, confirming the presence of Mn, In, S in the product (Fig. S5).The signal from O element is originated from the surface adsorbed water and hydroxyl oxygen 62, while C element is from the reference carbon.The binding energies of In 3d 3/2 and 3d 5/2 in the heterojunction are 452.4eV and 444.8 eV, respectively.In comparison with pristine In 2 S 3 , these two XPS peaks have been negatively shifted about 0.3 eV (Fig. 3A) 63.This result indicates that the electron density around In atom in In 2 S 3 became increased after the formation of heterojunction 64.In contrast, XPS peaks of Mn 2p 1/2 and 2p 3/2 in the heterojunction is about 0.3 eV positively shifted when compared to pristine MnS 65, showing that the electron density of Mn atom in MnS has been decreased after the formation of heterojunction (Fig. 3B).Above results clearly indicate that there is a strong interaction between MnS and In 2 S 3 in the composite, confirming the formation of p-n heterojunction.Specifically, the electron increase at the In 2 S 3 side and electron decrease at the MnS side imply that some electrons have been transferred from MnS to In 2 S 3 after the formation of p-n heterojunction.This observation is consistent with the fact that p-type SC (e.g., MnS) will loss electrons at the interface once it intimately contacts with a n-type SC (e.g., In 2 S 3 ).For the S atom, no obvious difference in XPS spectrum was observed after the formation of heterojunction, since both SCs contain S element.The atomic ratio of Mn to In on the sample surface is about 1:1.25, which is close the weigh percentage of 30 wt MnS in the product. Controlling the impregnating amount of Mn 2 ions inside MIL-68(In), a series of MnS/In 2 S 3 p-n heterojunctions with tunable weight percentages can be prepared.For example, MnS/In 2 S 3 p-n heterojunctions with 10 wt, 20 wt and 30 wt MnS inside have also been prepared by adding 1.7 mg, 3.9 mg, 6.8 mg MnCl 2 to a given amount of MIL-68(In) (0.02 g), respectively.The XRD patterns of these MnS/In 2 S 3 samples were shown in Fig. 4A.Without Mn 2 loading, only a set of XRD peaks from b-In 2 S 3 were displayed. As the increase of Mn 2 content, the XRD peaks from c-MnS were gradually increased, confirming the increasing amount of MnS in the prepared composites.Because of the light absorption difference between MnS and In 2 S 3 , DRS absorption of MnS/In 2 S 3 heterojunctions is also changed along with the MnS amount (see Fig. 4B).Note that the increase of MnS content in the heterojunctions can enhance the light absorption in the range of 500-700 nm, which is favorable for light harvesting in the visible range for photocatalysis. The photocatalytic activity of CO 2 reduction on the prepared MnS/In 2 S 3 p-n heterojunctions is evaluated under the simulated solar spectrum (Xe lamp, 100 mW cm A2 ).In our system, the photocatalytic products after CO 2 photoreduction were dominated by CO and only a trace amount of H 2 was detected.The formation of CO as the main product may be attributed to the solvent effect (acetonitrile) and poor adsorption of CO intermediate on catalyst 66,67.With pristine In 2 S 3 and MnS as catalysts, the CO generation rates are around 14 lmol g -1 h A1 and 16 lmol g -1 h A1 , respectively.Strikingly, a huge enhancement in photocatalytic activity was observed when using MnS/In 2 S 3 heterojunctions as catalyst.In contrast, a physical mixture of MnS and In 2 S 3 with the same weight percentage (30 wt) only has a slight increase in activity (see Fig. S6), implying that the formation of p-n heterojunction is the key to remarkably boost their photocatalytic performance.At the same time, the activities of MnS/In 2 S 3 heterojunctions are gradually increased along with the weight percentage of MnS. The optimal CO product rate is 58 lmol g -1 h A1 in the MnS/In 2 S 3 heterojunction (30 wt), which is above 4-fold higher than that of In 2 S 3 and MnS, respectively (see Fig. 5B).Using isotopic 13 CO 2 as the gas source, our control experiment confirmed that the CO product in this system was indeed from the CO 2 source (Fig. S7).It was also found that excessive MnS in the composites (30 wt ) would lead to a decrease in activity, presumably because of the formation of a few free MnS nanoparticles which did not directly contact In 2 S 3 in the particle, failing to form efficient p-n heterojunction. Photocatalytic stability of the MnS/In 2 S 3 heterojunctions was also tested by performing the reaction in four consecutive runs.No obvious decrease in activity was found after a period of 12 h test (Fig. 5C).The XRD patterns, SEM and TEM image of the catalyst after 4-run test were also investigated and no distinct change in phase and morphology were observed (see Fig. S8 andS9), showing that the prepared MnS/In 2 S 3 heterojunctions are relatively stable under the given catalytic condition.We just observed photo-corrosion of catalysts in a long-term test (16 h), presumably because non-aqueous solution and sacrificial agent were used in the system.The catalyst was also evaluated by performing CO 2 photoreaction under different single-wavelength light irradiation (Fig. 5D).The results are consistent well with the absorption spectrum of MnS/In 2 S 3 heterojunction, verifying that both MnS and In 2 S 3 in the composites participated in the light absorption. To reveal the formation of efficient p-n heterojunctions, MAS plot of the MnS/In 2 S 3 (30 wt) catalyst was also evaluated under a wide range of applied potential.As the increase of applied potential, a distinct V-shaped profile was observed (Fig. 6A).This is because MnS is a p-type SC with a negative slope while In 2 S 3 belongs to n-type SCs with a positive slop.The sharp change in MAS slop verifies the formation of efficient p-n heterojunctions 68,69.In comparison with pristine In 2 S 3 and MnS, the MnS/ In 2 S 3 heterojunction also displayed a much smaller semicircle in EIS data (Nyquist plots), showing a low charge transfer resistance (R ct ) at the interface (Fig. 6B).Such low R ct is originated from the built-in electric field in the p-n heterojunctions 70.Among various MnS/In 2 S 3 heterojunctions with different compositions, 30 wt MnS/In 2 S 3 exhibit the lowest charge transfer resistance, which is consistent with their photocatalytic performance.Photocurrents of samples also indicated that current densities of In 2 S 3 could be enhanced after the formation of heterojunctions with MnS (Fig. 6C).This result confirms that the formation of p-n heterojunction can effectively separate the photogenerated electrons and holes and thus suppress the recombination of charge carriers.As PL emission can reflect the recombination status of charge carriers, PL spectra of different samples were also investigated (Fig. 6D).In accordance with the photocurrents, the 30 wt MnS/ In 2 S 3 showed a lowest PL intensity, confirming a low recombination rate in this sample due to charge separation. On the basis of above measurements, a possible photocatalytic mechanism of the MnS/In 2 S 3 heterojunction is illustrated in Scheme 2. According to the CB positions and optical bandgaps, energy level diagrams of pristine MnS and In 2 S 3 are illustrated in Scheme 2A.Obviously, there is a staggered band alignment (type II) between In 2 S 3 and MnS before contact.The build-in electron field and interfacial band bending both supports the formation of p-n heterojunction rather than a Z-scheme heterojunction 71.Specifically, the CBM position of MnS is higher than that of In 2 S 3 so that photogenerated electrons in MnS have a tendency to transfer to In 2 S 3 .Of particular note, such a tendency can be further enhanced when the Femi levels of two SCs are aligned due to the formation of p-n heterojunction.As a result, MnS in the heterojunction will possess an even higher CBM position in relative with that of In 2 S 3 .Such a large difference in CBM position will provide a even stronger driving force for the electrons migrating from MnS to In 2 S 3 , than those in the original type II structures.For the same reason, the formation of p-n heterojunction also provides a stronger driving force for the migration of photogenerated holes from In 2 S 3 to MnS at the interface.At the same time, owing to the formation of a strong built-in electric field, the flow directions of electrons and holes are both directed at the interface and the reverse flow of charge carriers are prohibited.In short, the big difference in CBM/VBM position and the strong built-in electric field provide a powerful interface to suppress the charge recombination in both MnS and In 2 S 3 in the p-n heterojunctions.As a result, the photogenerated electrons will be accumulated on the In 2 S 3 side for CO 2 reduction under light irradiation.Meanwhile, the photogenerated holes will be gathered at the MnS side and sequentially consumed by TEOA, for establishing a stead-state charge balance in the photocatalytic system."}], "lamp": [{"llm generation": "Xe lamp", "source": "A 300-W Xe lamp (Solaredge 700, set at 100 mW cm A2 ) was placed on the top window as the light source.", "context": "The synthesis of MIL-68(In) submicro-rods was performed according to a reported protocol with slight modification.In a typical synthesis, 4.5 mg of In(NO 3 ) 3 and 5.5 mg of 1,4-phthalic acid (H 2 BDC) are dissolved in 2 mL of dimethylformamide (DMF) and stirred for 5 min.Then, the resulting solution was placed in an oil bath and heated at 120 C for 30 min.Next, white precipitate was filtered from the solution and washed with ethanol thrice.The collected product was then dried in vacuum at 80 C overnight. In a typical process, 0.02 g of the above-prepared MIL-68(In) submicro-rods were dispersed in 20 mL ethanol under ultrasonic treatment.Next, 6.8 mg of anhydrous MnCl 2 were dissolved in 10 mL ethanol and added into the MIL-68(In) solution.After being ultrasonically treated for 10 min, the mixed solution was magnetically stirred for 8 h for the adsorption of Mn 2 ions in the MOF pores.The ethanol solution was then slowly evaporated till most solvent was removed.The concentrated solution was subsequently transferred to a glass tube and dried in vacuum at 80 C overnight.Keeping the amount of MIL-68(In) constant, different amount of Mn 2 ions were also loaded inside MIL-68(In) submicro-rods in the parallel experiments for further use.

The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction experiments were performed in Pyrex cell with a top irradiation window and equipped with circulation water system.The temperature was controlled at room-temperature (20 C).A 300-W Xe lamp (Solaredge 700, set at 100 mW cm A2 ) was placed on the top window as the light source.The photocatalyst (5 mg) were suspended in a mixed solution of 9 mL acetonitrile and 1 mL triethanolamine (TEOA).Prior to photoreaction, the reaction cell was evacuated and refilled with high-purity CO 2 for three times to remove O 2 and other possible gases.Next, the CO 2 -saturated solution was irradiated under the Xe lamp.Gas sample (500 lL) was intermittently taken from the cell with a syringe and quantified by gas chromatography (GC7820A, Agilent).To test the stability of photocatalysts, three consecutive photoreaction runs (3 h each) were conducted over the photocatalysts.Between different runs, the cell was evacuated and refilled with CO 2 , keeping other parameters constant."}, {"llm generation": "Xenon", "source": "The photocatalytic activity of CO 2 reduction on the prepared MnS/In 2 S 3 p-n heterojunctions is evaluated under the simulated solar spectrum (Xe lamp, 100 mW cm A2 ).", "context": "The synthetic process for the MnS/In 2 S 3 hierarchical structures is illustrated in Scheme 1.At the beginning, MIL-68(In) submicro-rods were prepared by a solvothermal method using In 3 and BDC 2-as metal ion and ligand, respectively.The pore size of MIL-68(In) particles is about 16 A so that Mn 2 ions could be facilely diffused inside the pores of MIL-68(In) when these were dispersed in an ethanol solution of Mn 2 ions 54.Once the solvent was slowly evaporated, most of Mn 2 ions would enter into the MOFs pores and be adsorbed inside the channels.Using the Mn 2 -loaded MIL-68(In) submicro-rods as templates, both Mn 2 and In 3 ions could react with thiourea, a sulfur source which can slowly release S 2-under solvothermal condition 55.Since the sulfurizing process proceeded in a slow manner, the rod-like morphology of MIL-68(In) submicro-rods could be preserved in the final product, although the regular pore structures of MOFs were broken.As a result, MnS/In 2 S 3 hierarchical structures with an overall rod-like morphology were produced. Fig. 1A displays a typical SEM image of the prepared MIL-68(In) submicro-rods.These particles exhibit a distinct rod-like appearance with an average diameter of ca.300 nm and length up to 4 lm.TEM reveals that these MIL-68(In) submicro-rods have a cylindrical-shaped structure and their surface is smooth (inset of Fig. 1A).XRD patterns of these submicro-rods are well consistent with the simulated XRD peaks of MIL-68(In) crystal (see Fig. S1), confirming that these particles are indeed MIL-68(In) crystals.When Mn 2 ions were loaded in MIL-68(In) and reacted with thiourea, the final product still maintained a rod-like morphology Scheme 1. Schematic illustration of the synthetic process for MnS/In 2 S 3 heterojuctions using MIL-68(In) as template.(Fig. 1B).However, the particle surface is obviously different from MIL-68(In) and many nanosheets could be observed on their surface.At the same time, the inner side of these rods is hollow, exhibiting a hierarchical tubular structure (inset of Fig. 1B).This structural feature can be further confirmed by magnified TEM images (see Fig. S2).Two sets of XRD patterns appeared in the final product (see Fig. S3), in which one set of peaks could be indexed to hexagonal c-MnS (JCPDS card No. 40-1289) while the other set of XRD peaks belong to cubic b-In 2 S 3 (JCPDS card No. 65-0459).The XRD patterns confirm that the product is composed of two types of nanocrystals, namely c-MnS and b-In 2 S 3 .To determine the distribution of MnS and In 2 S 3 in each submicro-tubes, we performed elemental mappings on the hierarchical particle (Fig. 1C).Interestingly, we observed that S, In, Mn elements were all well distributed throughout the hierarchical structures, indicating that plenty of small MnS and In 2 S 3 nanocrystals were formed inside the particle.This phenomenon is attributed to the fact that both In 3 and Mn 2 ions were evenly distributed inside the Mn 2 -loaded MIL-68(In) submicro-rods, providing a homogeneous environment to build plenty of MnS/In 2 S 3 heterojunctions in each particle.Clear lattice fringes from MnS and In 2 S 3 could be clearly observed under HRTEM (see Fig. 1D).The lattice spacing of 0.26 nm and 0.32 nm are ascribed to the (0 0 2) plane of c-MnS and the (3 1 1) plane of b-In 2 S 3 , respectively. To assess whether the band structures of MnS and In 2 S 3 are suitable for building efficient heterojunction for photocatalytic applications, we employed DRS to investigate their optimal bandgaps.Pristine In 2 S 3 nanosheets with a hierarchical structure were also prepared by directly using MIL-68(In) submicro-rods as precursor without the loading of Mn 2 ions (see Fig. S4A andS4B).For comparison, MnS nanoparticles were also prepared under a similar condition without the use of MIL-68(In) precursor (see Fig. S4C andS4D).The DRS data (Fig. 2A and2B) show that both In 2 S 3 and MnS have a distinct absorption in the visible range.In the DRS of MnS, two absorption peaks above 500 nm also appeared in addition to the band edge absorption.This is due to the transitions between partially occupied 3d states of Mn 2 ions 56,57.Using corresponding Tauc plots (insets of Fig. 2A and2B), the optical band gaps of In 2 S 3 and MnS were estimated to be 2.15 eV and 2.68 eV, respectively. Flatband potentials (E fb ) of In 2 S 3 and MnS were further determined by MAS method.The positive slop implies that In 2 S 3 is an n-type SC while the negative slop of MnS suggests that it belongs to p-type SCs (Fig. 2C and2D).These results are consistent with previous researches 58,59.Considering that the E fb is generally about 0.1 eV below the conduction band minimum (CBM) of ntype SCs or 0.1 eV above the valence band maximum (VBM) of ptype SCs 60,61, the CBM position of In 2 S 3 is estimated to be A0.42 V and the VBM position of MnS is about 1.52 V. On the basis of the measured bandgaps and CBM/VBM positions, band structures of MnS and In 2 S 3 are illustrated in Fig. 2E.Obviously, a p-n heterojunction with a staggered energy level alignment can be expected between MnS and In 2 S 3 .The hierarchical tubular structure can enable plenty of MnS/In 2 S 3 p-n heterojunctions assembled in one particle. The surface compositions and binding environment of MnS/ In 2 S 3 (30 wt) heterojunction were further investigated by XPS.In the XPS survey spectrum, distinct signals from Mn, In, S elements could all be detected, confirming the presence of Mn, In, S in the product (Fig. S5).The signal from O element is originated from the surface adsorbed water and hydroxyl oxygen 62, while C element is from the reference carbon.The binding energies of In 3d 3/2 and 3d 5/2 in the heterojunction are 452.4eV and 444.8 eV, respectively.In comparison with pristine In 2 S 3 , these two XPS peaks have been negatively shifted about 0.3 eV (Fig. 3A) 63.This result indicates that the electron density around In atom in In 2 S 3 became increased after the formation of heterojunction 64.In contrast, XPS peaks of Mn 2p 1/2 and 2p 3/2 in the heterojunction is about 0.3 eV positively shifted when compared to pristine MnS 65, showing that the electron density of Mn atom in MnS has been decreased after the formation of heterojunction (Fig. 3B).Above results clearly indicate that there is a strong interaction between MnS and In 2 S 3 in the composite, confirming the formation of p-n heterojunction.Specifically, the electron increase at the In 2 S 3 side and electron decrease at the MnS side imply that some electrons have been transferred from MnS to In 2 S 3 after the formation of p-n heterojunction.This observation is consistent with the fact that p-type SC (e.g., MnS) will loss electrons at the interface once it intimately contacts with a n-type SC (e.g., In 2 S 3 ).For the S atom, no obvious difference in XPS spectrum was observed after the formation of heterojunction, since both SCs contain S element.The atomic ratio of Mn to In on the sample surface is about 1:1.25, which is close the weigh percentage of 30 wt MnS in the product. Controlling the impregnating amount of Mn 2 ions inside MIL-68(In), a series of MnS/In 2 S 3 p-n heterojunctions with tunable weight percentages can be prepared.For example, MnS/In 2 S 3 p-n heterojunctions with 10 wt, 20 wt and 30 wt MnS inside have also been prepared by adding 1.7 mg, 3.9 mg, 6.8 mg MnCl 2 to a given amount of MIL-68(In) (0.02 g), respectively.The XRD patterns of these MnS/In 2 S 3 samples were shown in Fig. 4A.Without Mn 2 loading, only a set of XRD peaks from b-In 2 S 3 were displayed. As the increase of Mn 2 content, the XRD peaks from c-MnS were gradually increased, confirming the increasing amount of MnS in the prepared composites.Because of the light absorption difference between MnS and In 2 S 3 , DRS absorption of MnS/In 2 S 3 heterojunctions is also changed along with the MnS amount (see Fig. 4B).Note that the increase of MnS content in the heterojunctions can enhance the light absorption in the range of 500-700 nm, which is favorable for light harvesting in the visible range for photocatalysis. The photocatalytic activity of CO 2 reduction on the prepared MnS/In 2 S 3 p-n heterojunctions is evaluated under the simulated solar spectrum (Xe lamp, 100 mW cm A2 ).In our system, the photocatalytic products after CO 2 photoreduction were dominated by CO and only a trace amount of H 2 was detected.The formation of CO as the main product may be attributed to the solvent effect (acetonitrile) and poor adsorption of CO intermediate on catalyst 66,67.With pristine In 2 S 3 and MnS as catalysts, the CO generation rates are around 14 lmol g -1 h A1 and 16 lmol g -1 h A1 , respectively.Strikingly, a huge enhancement in photocatalytic activity was observed when using MnS/In 2 S 3 heterojunctions as catalyst.In contrast, a physical mixture of MnS and In 2 S 3 with the same weight percentage (30 wt) only has a slight increase in activity (see Fig. S6), implying that the formation of p-n heterojunction is the key to remarkably boost their photocatalytic performance.At the same time, the activities of MnS/In 2 S 3 heterojunctions are gradually increased along with the weight percentage of MnS. The optimal CO product rate is 58 lmol g -1 h A1 in the MnS/In 2 S 3 heterojunction (30 wt), which is above 4-fold higher than that of In 2 S 3 and MnS, respectively (see Fig. 5B).Using isotopic 13 CO 2 as the gas source, our control experiment confirmed that the CO product in this system was indeed from the CO 2 source (Fig. S7).It was also found that excessive MnS in the composites (30 wt ) would lead to a decrease in activity, presumably because of the formation of a few free MnS nanoparticles which did not directly contact In 2 S 3 in the particle, failing to form efficient p-n heterojunction. Photocatalytic stability of the MnS/In 2 S 3 heterojunctions was also tested by performing the reaction in four consecutive runs.No obvious decrease in activity was found after a period of 12 h test (Fig. 5C).The XRD patterns, SEM and TEM image of the catalyst after 4-run test were also investigated and no distinct change in phase and morphology were observed (see Fig. S8 andS9), showing that the prepared MnS/In 2 S 3 heterojunctions are relatively stable under the given catalytic condition.We just observed photo-corrosion of catalysts in a long-term test (16 h), presumably because non-aqueous solution and sacrificial agent were used in the system.The catalyst was also evaluated by performing CO 2 photoreaction under different single-wavelength light irradiation (Fig. 5D).The results are consistent well with the absorption spectrum of MnS/In 2 S 3 heterojunction, verifying that both MnS and In 2 S 3 in the composites participated in the light absorption. To reveal the formation of efficient p-n heterojunctions, MAS plot of the MnS/In 2 S 3 (30 wt) catalyst was also evaluated under a wide range of applied potential.As the increase of applied potential, a distinct V-shaped profile was observed (Fig. 6A).This is because MnS is a p-type SC with a negative slope while In 2 S 3 belongs to n-type SCs with a positive slop.The sharp change in MAS slop verifies the formation of efficient p-n heterojunctions 68,69.In comparison with pristine In 2 S 3 and MnS, the MnS/ In 2 S 3 heterojunction also displayed a much smaller semicircle in EIS data (Nyquist plots), showing a low charge transfer resistance (R ct ) at the interface (Fig. 6B).Such low R ct is originated from the built-in electric field in the p-n heterojunctions 70.Among various MnS/In 2 S 3 heterojunctions with different compositions, 30 wt MnS/In 2 S 3 exhibit the lowest charge transfer resistance, which is consistent with their photocatalytic performance.Photocurrents of samples also indicated that current densities of In 2 S 3 could be enhanced after the formation of heterojunctions with MnS (Fig. 6C).This result confirms that the formation of p-n heterojunction can effectively separate the photogenerated electrons and holes and thus suppress the recombination of charge carriers.As PL emission can reflect the recombination status of charge carriers, PL spectra of different samples were also investigated (Fig. 6D).In accordance with the photocurrents, the 30 wt MnS/ In 2 S 3 showed a lowest PL intensity, confirming a low recombination rate in this sample due to charge separation. On the basis of above measurements, a possible photocatalytic mechanism of the MnS/In 2 S 3 heterojunction is illustrated in Scheme 2. According to the CB positions and optical bandgaps, energy level diagrams of pristine MnS and In 2 S 3 are illustrated in Scheme 2A.Obviously, there is a staggered band alignment (type II) between In 2 S 3 and MnS before contact.The build-in electron field and interfacial band bending both supports the formation of p-n heterojunction rather than a Z-scheme heterojunction 71.Specifically, the CBM position of MnS is higher than that of In 2 S 3 so that photogenerated electrons in MnS have a tendency to transfer to In 2 S 3 .Of particular note, such a tendency can be further enhanced when the Femi levels of two SCs are aligned due to the formation of p-n heterojunction.As a result, MnS in the heterojunction will possess an even higher CBM position in relative with that of In 2 S 3 .Such a large difference in CBM position will provide a even stronger driving force for the electrons migrating from MnS to In 2 S 3 , than those in the original type II structures.For the same reason, the formation of p-n heterojunction also provides a stronger driving force for the migration of photogenerated holes from In 2 S 3 to MnS at the interface.At the same time, owing to the formation of a strong built-in electric field, the flow directions of electrons and holes are both directed at the interface and the reverse flow of charge carriers are prohibited.In short, the big difference in CBM/VBM position and the strong built-in electric field provide a powerful interface to suppress the charge recombination in both MnS and In 2 S 3 in the p-n heterojunctions.As a result, the photogenerated electrons will be accumulated on the In 2 S 3 side for CO 2 reduction under light irradiation.Meanwhile, the photogenerated holes will be gathered at the MnS side and sequentially consumed by TEOA, for establishing a stead-state charge balance in the photocatalytic system."}], "reaction medium": [{"llm generation": "Liquid", "source": "The photocatalyst (5 mg) were suspended in a mixed solution of 9 mL acetonitrile and 1 mL triethanolamine (TEOA).", "context": "The synthesis of MIL-68(In) submicro-rods was performed according to a reported protocol with slight modification.In a typical synthesis, 4.5 mg of In(NO 3 ) 3 and 5.5 mg of 1,4-phthalic acid (H 2 BDC) are dissolved in 2 mL of dimethylformamide (DMF) and stirred for 5 min.Then, the resulting solution was placed in an oil bath and heated at 120 C for 30 min.Next, white precipitate was filtered from the solution and washed with ethanol thrice.The collected product was then dried in vacuum at 80 C overnight. In a typical process, 0.02 g of the above-prepared MIL-68(In) submicro-rods were dispersed in 20 mL ethanol under ultrasonic treatment.Next, 6.8 mg of anhydrous MnCl 2 were dissolved in 10 mL ethanol and added into the MIL-68(In) solution.After being ultrasonically treated for 10 min, the mixed solution was magnetically stirred for 8 h for the adsorption of Mn 2 ions in the MOF pores.The ethanol solution was then slowly evaporated till most solvent was removed.The concentrated solution was subsequently transferred to a glass tube and dried in vacuum at 80 C overnight.Keeping the amount of MIL-68(In) constant, different amount of Mn 2 ions were also loaded inside MIL-68(In) submicro-rods in the parallel experiments for further use.

Flatband potentials (E fb ) of In 2 S 3 and MnS were further determined by MAS method.The positive slop implies that In 2 S 3 is an n-type SC while the negative slop of MnS suggests that it belongs to p-type SCs (Fig. 2C and2D).These results are consistent with previous researches 58,59.Considering that the E fb is generally about 0.1 eV below the conduction band minimum (CBM) of ntype SCs or 0.1 eV above the valence band maximum (VBM) of ptype SCs 60,61, the CBM position of In 2 S 3 is estimated to be A0.42 V and the VBM position of MnS is about 1.52 V. On the basis of the measured bandgaps and CBM/VBM positions, band structures of MnS and In 2 S 3 are illustrated in Fig. 2E.Obviously, a p-n heterojunction with a staggered energy level alignment can be expected between MnS and In 2 S 3 .The hierarchical tubular structure can enable plenty of MnS/In 2 S 3 p-n heterojunctions assembled in one particle. The surface compositions and binding environment of MnS/ In 2 S 3 (30 wt) heterojunction were further investigated by XPS.In the XPS survey spectrum, distinct signals from Mn, In, S elements could all be detected, confirming the presence of Mn, In, S in the product (Fig. S5).The signal from O element is originated from the surface adsorbed water and hydroxyl oxygen 62, while C element is from the reference carbon.The binding energies of In 3d 3/2 and 3d 5/2 in the heterojunction are 452.4eV and 444.8 eV, respectively.In comparison with pristine In 2 S 3 , these two XPS peaks have been negatively shifted about 0.3 eV (Fig. 3A) 63.This result indicates that the electron density around In atom in In 2 S 3 became increased after the formation of heterojunction 64.In contrast, XPS peaks of Mn 2p 1/2 and 2p 3/2 in the heterojunction is about 0.3 eV positively shifted when compared to pristine MnS 65, showing that the electron density of Mn atom in MnS has been decreased after the formation of heterojunction (Fig. 3B).Above results clearly indicate that there is a strong interaction between MnS and In 2 S 3 in the composite, confirming the formation of p-n heterojunction.Specifically, the electron increase at the In 2 S 3 side and electron decrease at the MnS side imply that some electrons have been transferred from MnS to In 2 S 3 after the formation of p-n heterojunction.This observation is consistent with the fact that p-type SC (e.g., MnS) will loss electrons at the interface once it intimately contacts with a n-type SC (e.g., In 2 S 3 ).For the S atom, no obvious difference in XPS spectrum was observed after the formation of heterojunction, since both SCs contain S element.The atomic ratio of Mn to In on the sample surface is about 1:1.25, which is close the weigh percentage of 30 wt MnS in the product. Controlling the impregnating amount of Mn 2 ions inside MIL-68(In), a series of MnS/In 2 S 3 p-n heterojunctions with tunable weight percentages can be prepared.For example, MnS/In 2 S 3 p-n heterojunctions with 10 wt, 20 wt and 30 wt MnS inside have also been prepared by adding 1.7 mg, 3.9 mg, 6.8 mg MnCl 2 to a given amount of MIL-68(In) (0.02 g), respectively.The XRD patterns of these MnS/In 2 S 3 samples were shown in Fig. 4A.Without Mn 2 loading, only a set of XRD peaks from b-In 2 S 3 were displayed. As the increase of Mn 2 content, the XRD peaks from c-MnS were gradually increased, confirming the increasing amount of MnS in the prepared composites.Because of the light absorption difference between MnS and In 2 S 3 , DRS absorption of MnS/In 2 S 3 heterojunctions is also changed along with the MnS amount (see Fig. 4B).Note that the increase of MnS content in the heterojunctions can enhance the light absorption in the range of 500-700 nm, which is favorable for light harvesting in the visible range for photocatalysis. The photocatalytic activity of CO 2 reduction on the prepared MnS/In 2 S 3 p-n heterojunctions is evaluated under the simulated solar spectrum (Xe lamp, 100 mW cm A2 ).In our system, the photocatalytic products after CO 2 photoreduction were dominated by CO and only a trace amount of H 2 was detected.The formation of CO as the main product may be attributed to the solvent effect (acetonitrile) and poor adsorption of CO intermediate on catalyst 66,67.With pristine In 2 S 3 and MnS as catalysts, the CO generation rates are around 14 lmol g -1 h A1 and 16 lmol g -1 h A1 , respectively.Strikingly, a huge enhancement in photocatalytic activity was observed when using MnS/In 2 S 3 heterojunctions as catalyst.In contrast, a physical mixture of MnS and In 2 S 3 with the same weight percentage (30 wt) only has a slight increase in activity (see Fig. S6), implying that the formation of p-n heterojunction is the key to remarkably boost their photocatalytic performance.At the same time, the activities of MnS/In 2 S 3 heterojunctions are gradually increased along with the weight percentage of MnS. The optimal CO product rate is 58 lmol g -1 h A1 in the MnS/In 2 S 3 heterojunction (30 wt), which is above 4-fold higher than that of In 2 S 3 and MnS, respectively (see Fig. 5B).Using isotopic 13 CO 2 as the gas source, our control experiment confirmed that the CO product in this system was indeed from the CO 2 source (Fig. S7).It was also found that excessive MnS in the composites (30 wt ) would lead to a decrease in activity, presumably because of the formation of a few free MnS nanoparticles which did not directly contact In 2 S 3 in the particle, failing to form efficient p-n heterojunction. Photocatalytic stability of the MnS/In 2 S 3 heterojunctions was also tested by performing the reaction in four consecutive runs.No obvious decrease in activity was found after a period of 12 h test (Fig. 5C).The XRD patterns, SEM and TEM image of the catalyst after 4-run test were also investigated and no distinct change in phase and morphology were observed (see Fig. S8 andS9), showing that the prepared MnS/In 2 S 3 heterojunctions are relatively stable under the given catalytic condition.We just observed photo-corrosion of catalysts in a long-term test (16 h), presumably because non-aqueous solution and sacrificial agent were used in the system.The catalyst was also evaluated by performing CO 2 photoreaction under different single-wavelength light irradiation (Fig. 5D).The results are consistent well with the absorption spectrum of MnS/In 2 S 3 heterojunction, verifying that both MnS and In 2 S 3 in the composites participated in the light absorption. To reveal the formation of efficient p-n heterojunctions, MAS plot of the MnS/In 2 S 3 (30 wt) catalyst was also evaluated under a wide range of applied potential.As the increase of applied potential, a distinct V-shaped profile was observed (Fig. 6A).This is because MnS is a p-type SC with a negative slope while In 2 S 3 belongs to n-type SCs with a positive slop.The sharp change in MAS slop verifies the formation of efficient p-n heterojunctions 68,69.In comparison with pristine In 2 S 3 and MnS, the MnS/ In 2 S 3 heterojunction also displayed a much smaller semicircle in EIS data (Nyquist plots), showing a low charge transfer resistance (R ct ) at the interface (Fig. 6B).Such low R ct is originated from the built-in electric field in the p-n heterojunctions 70.Among various MnS/In 2 S 3 heterojunctions with different compositions, 30 wt MnS/In 2 S 3 exhibit the lowest charge transfer resistance, which is consistent with their photocatalytic performance.Photocurrents of samples also indicated that current densities of In 2 S 3 could be enhanced after the formation of heterojunctions with MnS (Fig. 6C).This result confirms that the formation of p-n heterojunction can effectively separate the photogenerated electrons and holes and thus suppress the recombination of charge carriers.As PL emission can reflect the recombination status of charge carriers, PL spectra of different samples were also investigated (Fig. 6D).In accordance with the photocurrents, the 30 wt MnS/ In 2 S 3 showed a lowest PL intensity, confirming a low recombination rate in this sample due to charge separation. On the basis of above measurements, a possible photocatalytic mechanism of the MnS/In 2 S 3 heterojunction is illustrated in Scheme 2. According to the CB positions and optical bandgaps, energy level diagrams of pristine MnS and In 2 S 3 are illustrated in Scheme 2A.Obviously, there is a staggered band alignment (type II) between In 2 S 3 and MnS before contact.The build-in electron field and interfacial band bending both supports the formation of p-n heterojunction rather than a Z-scheme heterojunction 71.Specifically, the CBM position of MnS is higher than that of In 2 S 3 so that photogenerated electrons in MnS have a tendency to transfer to In 2 S 3 .Of particular note, such a tendency can be further enhanced when the Femi levels of two SCs are aligned due to the formation of p-n heterojunction.As a result, MnS in the heterojunction will possess an even higher CBM position in relative with that of In 2 S 3 .Such a large difference in CBM position will provide a even stronger driving force for the electrons migrating from MnS to In 2 S 3 , than those in the original type II structures.For the same reason, the formation of p-n heterojunction also provides a stronger driving force for the migration of photogenerated holes from In 2 S 3 to MnS at the interface.At the same time, owing to the formation of a strong built-in electric field, the flow directions of electrons and holes are both directed at the interface and the reverse flow of charge carriers are prohibited.In short, the big difference in CBM/VBM position and the strong built-in electric field provide a powerful interface to suppress the charge recombination in both MnS and In 2 S 3 in the p-n heterojunctions.As a result, the photogenerated electrons will be accumulated on the In 2 S 3 side for CO 2 reduction under light irradiation.Meanwhile, the photogenerated holes will be gathered at the MnS side and sequentially consumed by TEOA, for establishing a stead-state charge balance in the photocatalytic system."}], "reactor type": [{"llm generation": "Slurry", "source": "The photocatalyst (5 mg) were suspended in a mixed solution of 9 mL acetonitrile and 1 mL triethanolamine (TEOA).", "context": "The synthesis of MIL-68(In) submicro-rods was performed according to a reported protocol with slight modification.In a typical synthesis, 4.5 mg of In(NO 3 ) 3 and 5.5 mg of 1,4-phthalic acid (H 2 BDC) are dissolved in 2 mL of dimethylformamide (DMF) and stirred for 5 min.Then, the resulting solution was placed in an oil bath and heated at 120 C for 30 min.Next, white precipitate was filtered from the solution and washed with ethanol thrice.The collected product was then dried in vacuum at 80 C overnight.
