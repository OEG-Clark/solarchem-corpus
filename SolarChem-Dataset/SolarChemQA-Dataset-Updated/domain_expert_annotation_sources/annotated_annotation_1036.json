Raman spectra of MgIn 2 S 4 -C2 and MgIn 2 S 4 -SC samples showed characteristics D and G bands of carbon-based materials at 1370 and 1587 cm -1 (Fig. 1b), which corresponded to disordered and ordered sp 2bonded carbon atoms, respectively 33.Moreover, a 2 nm carbon layer was detected on the edges of MgIn 2 S 4 -C2 and MgIn 2 S 4 -SC but not of the MgIn 2 S 4 sample (Fig. 1c-e).Additionally, after carbon incorporation, the color of the material changed from red (which was a color of pristine MgIn 2 S 4 ) to black (color of the modified MgIn 2 S 4 -C2 and MgIn 2 S 4 -SC samples), which resulted in significantly enhanced lightharvesting ability in the visible region (Fig. S4).XPS spectra were corrected using binding energy of the C 1 s peak at 284.8 eV arising from adventitious carbon of the XPS instrument.All samples showed peaks belonging to Mg, In, S, O, and C (Fig. S5).The O 1 s peak was attributed to O 2 and H 2 O adsorbed on the surface of sample.Time-dependent XPS analysis with Ar sputtering showed a chemical configuration of carbon in our samples (Fig. 2a-c).C 1 s peak intensity decreased upon Ar sputtering for 100 s may be due to organic carbon decomposition.After 100 s, C 1 s peak intensity remained almost unchanged.However, C 1 s peak of the MgIn 2 S 4 -C2 sample shifted to lower binding energy (equal to 284.4 eV), while positions of the C 1 s peaks for the MgIn 2 S 4 and MgIn 2 S 4 -SC samples remained the same (284.8eV).Fig. 2d displays high-resolution XPS spectra after 500 s of Ar sputtering.Because the samples were pressed into small pellets, it was hard to eliminate peaks corresponding to the adventitious carbon on the particle surfaces regardless of the Ar sputtering duration.Therefore, the peak at 284.8 eV observed in the XPS spectrum of the MgIn 2 S 4 sample was ascribed to the adventitious carbon from instrument.The peak at 284.8 eV visible in the XPS spectrum of the MgIn 2 S 4 -SC sample was attributed to adventitious carbon from instrument and carbon coated on the surface.Peaks at 284.8 and 284.4 eV detected in the XPS spectrum of MgIn 2 S 4 -C2 were assigned to carbon atoms on the surface and in the lattice, respectively 21,343536.Positions of high-resolution In 3d and S 2p peaks detected in the XPS spectra of MgIn 2 S 4 and MgIn 2 S 4 -SC samples were almost identical, while In 3d and S 2p peaks of MgIn 2 S 4 -C2 shifted to lower energies (Fig. 2e-f).These results confirmed that MgIn 2 S 4 -C2 contained both surface and doped carbon, resulting in the shift of XRD and XPS peaks, while the MgIn 2 S 4 -SC sample had only carbon on the surface. The photocatalytic activities of our materials were assessed by CO 2 reduction to CO under visible light ( 420 nm) irradiation in a gas-solid reaction system without any co-catalysts or sacrificial agents.In sharp contrast, the CO 2 conversion activity was markedly enhanced for MgIn 2 S 4 -CX, with the highest CO evolution rate of 1.171 mol/g/h delivered by MgIn 2 S 4 -C2, which was 19.5 times higher than the production rate under the presence of unmodified MgIn 2 S 4 (which was equal to 0.057 mol/g/h).CO production rate under the presence of the MgIn 2 S 4 -SC catalyst was 0.458 mol/g/h, which was 7.03 times higher than that of MgIn 2 S 4 (Fig. 3a-b).Particularly, CO production rate of MgIn 2 S 4 -Cx and MgIn 2 S 4 -SC with unit specific surface area (S BET , Fig. S6) was higher than that of pristine MgIn 2 S 4 , indicating S BET was not the cause for the enhanced photocatalytic performance of MgIn 2 S 4 -Cx and MgIn 2 S 4 -SC.In the CO 2 photocatalytic reduction process over all samples, no H 2 and CH 4 was detected, which may be resulted from the selective reduction of CO 2 over photocatalysts 37. Isotopic tracing experiment using 13 CO 2 coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) showed peaks at m/z equal to 29 and 45, which was attributed to 13 CO and 13 CO 2 (Fig. 3c).Compared to the pure 13 CO 2 , the signal at m/z 29 has increased after photoreaction over MgIn 2 S 4 -C2 sample under 13 CO 2 atmosphere 38.A very low CO evolution rate (7.57 of the normal CO amount), was observed in experiments iii and iv over MgIn 2 S 4 -C3 sample (contained the most carbon among all of samples), which could be neglected.Moreover, no CO was detected in the control photocatalytic CO reduction experiment (i) conducted with MgIn 2 S 4 -C3 sample, NaHCO and H 2 SO 4 aqueous solution, but without light illumination.To determine the carbon content of as-prepared samples, the MgIn 2 S 4 -C2 sample is eroded by aqua regia and remove MgIn 2 S 4 .The mass ratios of carbon to MgIn 2 S 4 in MgIn 2 S 4 -C2 sample before and after photoreaction are approximatively 6.2 and 7.6, respectively, the increase of which may be due to the deviation.Thus, it can be deduced that the Boudouard reaction between surface coated carbon and CO 2 may never take place.These results confirmed the CO photocatalytic formation under the presence of MgIn 2 S 4 -C2.Cycling experiments showed that MgIn 2 S 4 -Cx and MgIn 2 S 4 -SC possessed better stability than MgIn 2 S 4 ; thus, doping and coating the samples with carbon improved photocatalyst stability (Fig. S9).Fig. 3.

CO 2 adsorption ability of a catalyst is very important for its photocatalytic performance during CO 2 reduction reaction 39.CO 2 adsorption capacity of MgIn 2 S 4 -Cx and MgIn 2 S 4 -SC was stronger than MgIn 2 S 4 (Fig. 3d).As glucose content (x) increased, CO 2 adsorption capacity of MgIn 2 S 4 -Cx catalysts was improved.Thus, carbon modification of MgIn 2 S 4 -Cx and MgIn 2 S 4 -SC samples benefited CO 2 adsorption.On the other hand, the photogenerated charge separation efficiency is also crucial for photocatalytic performance.In general, low photoluminescence emission intensity explains the low recombination rate of photoinduced electron-hole pairs 4041.The PL emission intensity of MgIn 2 S 4 -SC was higher than that of MgIn 2 S 4 -C2 but lower than that of MgIn 2 S 4 (Fig. 4a).The average charge lifetime of MgIn 2 S 4 -SC was also shorter than that of MgIn 2 S 4 and longer than that of MgIn 2 S 4 -C2 (Fig. 4b).Shorter lifetime indicates the presence of a nonradiative pathway, which in the case of MgIn 2 S 4 -C2 very likely involved delocalization of electrons from MgIn 2 S 4 to C 20, supporting the most efficient charge separation of MgIn 2 S 4 -C2.The arc radii of the three samples were in the following order: MgIn 2 S 4 MgIn 2 S 4 -SC MgIn 2 S 4 -C2 (Fig. 4c).The smaller the radius, the higher the charge transfer efficiency typically is 42.Thus, the presence of carbon in the bulk and on the surface promoted charge separation and migration, but the effect of doped carbon was greater. To further understand the role of carbon in the bulk and on the surface of the catalyst in photocatalytic activity enhancement, we performed theoretical calculations using density functional theory (DFT) coupled with a plane-wave method.Our goal was to predict the charge distribution, effective conduction electron masses, CO 2 adsorption energy and Gibbs free energy for CO 2 conversion to CO.To confirm the location of C atoms in the MgIn 2 S 4 crystalline structure, we considered four possible ways of introducing carbon atom into MgIn 2 S 4 , namely, the C atom substituted Mg, In and S atom, and C doped in interstitial position.The model structures of MgIn 2 S 4 and C-doped MgIn 2 S 4 were displayed in Fig. S10.We calculated the formation energies (E f ) of a doped carbon atom in substitutional and interstitial configurations to characterize the stability of the carbon-doped MgIn 2 S 4 model (Table S1). The calculated E f value of interstitial doped C was lower than that of the substituted one, so C-doped MgIn 2 S 4 was more likely to exist as a C int -5 model.As shown in Fig. 5a, blue and yellow sphere represent charge lost and equivalent charge gain.Thus, C atom incorporated into the MgIn 2 S 4 lattice formed a stable covalent bond with adjacent S atoms, which allowed electrons to transfer directly from S to C atoms.q value, which corresponded to the carried charge of the C atoms, was calculated to be 0.82 eV using the Bader method 43.Effective conduction electron masses for pure MgIn 2 S 4 and C int -5 model were also simulated; their values were 0.120 and 0.075, respectively.Smaller effective mass favors high mobility of the charge carriers 44.Therefore, we believe that interstitial C doping caused charge redistribution and electron delocalization, both of which facilitated local charge separation, which, in turn, prevented charge recombination in the bulk. Presence of doped and coated carbon could lower the CO 2 adsorption energy and facilitate CO 2 adsorption (Fig. 5b), which agreed with our CO 2 adsorption curves shown in Fig. 3d.As we known, the intermediates among the photoconversion of CO 2 to hydrocarbon might contain COOH, CHO, CH 2 O, CH 3 O, and so on.Among them, CHO reacted with H and e -to generate CH 2 O; then, CH 2 O reacted with H and e - to generate CH 3 O; finally, CH 3 O reacted with H and e -to generate CH 4 45.Therefore, the most appropriate process of CO 2 photocatalytic reduction to CO was via COOH intermediate, which could be divided into the following three steps 4647484950 both carbon coating and carbon doping of catalysts could lower Gibbs free energy, while the synergistic effect of both carbon-types could minimize the energy barrier.Therefore, it could be deduced that the main function for doped carbon was that prevent charge recombination in the bulk, facilitate CO 2 adsorption, and decrease Gibbs's free energy for CO 2 reduction to CO, while coated carbon possessed the similar function but accelerating surface carriers migration, but had smaller and greater effect on fascinating CO 2 adsorption and decreasing photocatalytic reaction energy barrier.

CO 2 adsorption ability of a catalyst is very important for its photocatalytic performance during CO 2 reduction reaction 39.CO 2 adsorption capacity of MgIn 2 S 4 -Cx and MgIn 2 S 4 -SC was stronger than MgIn 2 S 4 (Fig. 3d).As glucose content (x) increased, CO 2 adsorption capacity of MgIn 2 S 4 -Cx catalysts was improved.Thus, carbon modification of MgIn 2 S 4 -Cx and MgIn 2 S 4 -SC samples benefited CO 2 adsorption.On the other hand, the photogenerated charge separation efficiency is also crucial for photocatalytic performance.In general, low photoluminescence emission intensity explains the low recombination rate of photoinduced electron-hole pairs 4041.The PL emission intensity of MgIn 2 S 4 -SC was higher than that of MgIn 2 S 4 -C2 but lower than that of MgIn 2 S 4 (Fig. 4a).The average charge lifetime of MgIn 2 S 4 -SC was also shorter than that of MgIn 2 S 4 and longer than that of MgIn 2 S 4 -C2 (Fig. 4b).Shorter lifetime indicates the presence of a nonradiative pathway, which in the case of MgIn 2 S 4 -C2 very likely involved delocalization of electrons from MgIn 2 S 4 to C 20, supporting the most efficient charge separation of MgIn 2 S 4 -C2.The arc radii of the three samples were in the following order: MgIn 2 S 4 MgIn 2 S 4 -SC MgIn 2 S 4 -C2 (Fig. 4c).The smaller the radius, the higher the charge transfer efficiency typically is 42.Thus, the presence of carbon in the bulk and on the surface promoted charge separation and migration, but the effect of doped carbon was greater.

The calculated E f value of interstitial doped C was lower than that of the substituted one, so C-doped MgIn 2 S 4 was more likely to exist as a C int -5 model.As shown in Fig. 5a, blue and yellow sphere represent charge lost and equivalent charge gain.Thus, C atom incorporated into the MgIn 2 S 4 lattice formed a stable covalent bond with adjacent S atoms, which allowed electrons to transfer directly from S to C atoms.q value, which corresponded to the carried charge of the C atoms, was calculated to be 0.82 eV using the Bader method 43.Effective conduction electron masses for pure MgIn 2 S 4 and C int -5 model were also simulated; their values were 0.120 and 0.075, respectively.Smaller effective mass favors high mobility of the charge carriers 44.Therefore, we believe that interstitial C doping caused charge redistribution and electron delocalization, both of which facilitated local charge separation, which, in turn, prevented charge recombination in the bulk.

Raman spectra of MgIn 2 S 4 -C2 and MgIn 2 S 4 -SC samples showed characteristics D and G bands of carbon-based materials at 1370 and 1587 cm -1 (Fig. 1b), which corresponded to disordered and ordered sp 2bonded carbon atoms, respectively 33.Moreover, a 2 nm carbon layer was detected on the edges of MgIn 2 S 4 -C2 and MgIn 2 S 4 -SC but not of the MgIn 2 S 4 sample (Fig. 1c-e).Additionally, after carbon incorporation, the color of the material changed from red (which was a color of pristine MgIn 2 S 4 ) to black (color of the modified MgIn 2 S 4 -C2 and MgIn 2 S 4 -SC samples), which resulted in significantly enhanced lightharvesting ability in the visible region (Fig. S4).XPS spectra were corrected using binding energy of the C 1 s peak at 284.8 eV arising from adventitious carbon of the XPS instrument.All samples showed peaks belonging to Mg, In, S, O, and C (Fig. S5).The O 1 s peak was attributed to O 2 and H 2 O adsorbed on the surface of sample.Time-dependent XPS analysis with Ar sputtering showed a chemical configuration of carbon in our samples (Fig. 2a-c).C 1 s peak intensity decreased upon Ar sputtering for 100 s may be due to organic carbon decomposition.After 100 s, C 1 s peak intensity remained almost unchanged.However, C 1 s peak of the MgIn 2 S 4 -C2 sample shifted to lower binding energy (equal to 284.4 eV), while positions of the C 1 s peaks for the MgIn 2 S 4 and MgIn 2 S 4 -SC samples remained the same (284.8eV).Fig. 2d displays high-resolution XPS spectra after 500 s of Ar sputtering.Because the samples were pressed into small pellets, it was hard to eliminate peaks corresponding to the adventitious carbon on the particle surfaces regardless of the Ar sputtering duration.Therefore, the peak at 284.8 eV observed in the XPS spectrum of the MgIn 2 S 4 sample was ascribed to the adventitious carbon from instrument.The peak at 284.8 eV visible in the XPS spectrum of the MgIn 2 S 4 -SC sample was attributed to adventitious carbon from instrument and carbon coated on the surface.Peaks at 284.8 and 284.4 eV detected in the XPS spectrum of MgIn 2 S 4 -C2 were assigned to carbon atoms on the surface and in the lattice, respectively 21,343536.Positions of high-resolution In 3d and S 2p peaks detected in the XPS spectra of MgIn 2 S 4 and MgIn 2 S 4 -SC samples were almost identical, while In 3d and S 2p peaks of MgIn 2 S 4 -C2 shifted to lower energies (Fig. 2e-f).These results confirmed that MgIn 2 S 4 -C2 contained both surface and doped carbon, resulting in the shift of XRD and XPS peaks, while the MgIn 2 S 4 -SC sample had only carbon on the surface. The photocatalytic activities of our materials were assessed by CO 2 reduction to CO under visible light ( 420 nm) irradiation in a gas-solid reaction system without any co-catalysts or sacrificial agents.In sharp contrast, the CO 2 conversion activity was markedly enhanced for MgIn 2 S 4 -CX, with the highest CO evolution rate of 1.171 mol/g/h delivered by MgIn 2 S 4 -C2, which was 19.5 times higher than the production rate under the presence of unmodified MgIn 2 S 4 (which was equal to 0.057 mol/g/h).CO production rate under the presence of the MgIn 2 S 4 -SC catalyst was 0.458 mol/g/h, which was 7.03 times higher than that of MgIn 2 S 4 (Fig. 3a-b).Particularly, CO production rate of MgIn 2 S 4 -Cx and MgIn 2 S 4 -SC with unit specific surface area (S BET , Fig. S6) was higher than that of pristine MgIn 2 S 4 , indicating S BET was not the cause for the enhanced photocatalytic performance of MgIn 2 S 4 -Cx and MgIn 2 S 4 -SC.In the CO 2 photocatalytic reduction process over all samples, no H 2 and CH 4 was detected, which may be resulted from the selective reduction of CO 2 over photocatalysts 37. Isotopic tracing experiment using 13 CO 2 coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) showed peaks at m/z equal to 29 and 45, which was attributed to 13 CO and 13 CO 2 (Fig. 3c).Compared to the pure 13 CO 2 , the signal at m/z 29 has increased after photoreaction over MgIn 2 S 4 -C2 sample under 13 CO 2 atmosphere 38.A very low CO evolution rate (7.57 of the normal CO amount), was observed in experiments iii and iv over MgIn 2 S 4 -C3 sample (contained the most carbon among all of samples), which could be neglected.Moreover, no CO was detected in the control photocatalytic CO reduction experiment (i) conducted with MgIn 2 S 4 -C3 sample, NaHCO and H 2 SO 4 aqueous solution, but without light illumination.To determine the carbon content of as-prepared samples, the MgIn 2 S 4 -C2 sample is eroded by aqua regia and remove MgIn 2 S 4 .The mass ratios of carbon to MgIn 2 S 4 in MgIn 2 S 4 -C2 sample before and after photoreaction are approximatively 6.2 and 7.6, respectively, the increase of which may be due to the deviation.Thus, it can be deduced that the Boudouard reaction between surface coated carbon and CO 2 may never take place.These results confirmed the CO photocatalytic formation under the presence of MgIn 2 S 4 -C2.Cycling experiments showed that MgIn 2 S 4 -Cx and MgIn 2 S 4 -SC possessed better stability than MgIn 2 S 4 ; thus, doping and coating the samples with carbon improved photocatalyst stability (Fig. S9).Fig. 3. Time dependence (a) and apparent rate constants (b) of CO yield for photo-reduction CO 2 over as-obtained samples under visible light irradiation ( nm).Mass spectra for Pure 13 CO 2 and CO 2 reduction over MgIn 2 S 4 -C2 sample under 13 CO 2 atmosphere (c).CO 2 adsorption curves of as-obtained samples (d). CO 2 adsorption ability of a catalyst is very important for its photocatalytic performance during CO 2 reduction reaction 39.CO 2 adsorption capacity of MgIn 2 S 4 -Cx and MgIn 2 S 4 -SC was stronger than MgIn 2 S 4 (Fig. 3d).As glucose content (x) increased, CO 2 adsorption capacity of MgIn 2 S 4 -Cx catalysts was improved.Thus, carbon modification of MgIn 2 S 4 -Cx and MgIn 2 S 4 -SC samples benefited CO 2 adsorption.On the other hand, the photogenerated charge separation efficiency is also crucial for photocatalytic performance.In general, low photoluminescence emission intensity explains the low recombination rate of photoinduced electron-hole pairs 4041.The PL emission intensity of MgIn 2 S 4 -SC was higher than that of MgIn 2 S 4 -C2 but lower than that of MgIn 2 S 4 (Fig. 4a).The average charge lifetime of MgIn 2 S 4 -SC was also shorter than that of MgIn 2 S 4 and longer than that of MgIn 2 S 4 -C2 (Fig. 4b).Shorter lifetime indicates the presence of a nonradiative pathway, which in the case of MgIn 2 S 4 -C2 very likely involved delocalization of electrons from MgIn 2 S 4 to C 20, supporting the most efficient charge separation of MgIn 2 S 4 -C2.The arc radii of the three samples were in the following order: MgIn 2 S 4 MgIn 2 S 4 -SC MgIn 2 S 4 -C2 (Fig. 4c).The smaller the radius, the higher the charge transfer efficiency typically is 42.Thus, the presence of carbon in the bulk and on the surface promoted charge separation and migration, but the effect of doped carbon was greater. To further understand the role of carbon in the bulk and on the surface of the catalyst in photocatalytic activity enhancement, we performed theoretical calculations using density functional theory (DFT) coupled with a plane-wave method.Our goal was to predict the charge distribution, effective conduction electron masses, CO 2 adsorption energy and Gibbs free energy for CO 2 conversion to CO.To confirm the location of C atoms in the MgIn 2 S 4 crystalline structure, we considered four possible ways of introducing carbon atom into MgIn 2 S 4 , namely, the C atom substituted Mg, In and S atom, and C doped in interstitial position.The model structures of MgIn 2 S 4 and C-doped MgIn 2 S 4 were displayed in Fig. S10.We calculated the formation energies (E f ) of a doped carbon atom in substitutional and interstitial configurations to characterize the stability of the carbon-doped MgIn 2 S 4 model (Table S1). The calculated E f value of interstitial doped C was lower than that of the substituted one, so C-doped MgIn 2 S 4 was more likely to exist as a C int -5 model.As shown in Fig. 5a, blue and yellow sphere represent charge lost and equivalent charge gain.Thus, C atom incorporated into the MgIn 2 S 4 lattice formed a stable covalent bond with adjacent S atoms, which allowed electrons to transfer directly from S to C atoms.q value, which corresponded to the carried charge of the C atoms, was calculated to be 0.82 eV using the Bader method 43.Effective conduction electron masses for pure MgIn 2 S 4 and C int -5 model were also simulated; their values were 0.120 and 0.075, respectively.Smaller effective mass favors high mobility of the charge carriers 44.Therefore, we believe that interstitial C doping caused charge redistribution and electron delocalization, both of which facilitated local charge separation, which, in turn, prevented charge recombination in the bulk. Presence of doped and coated carbon could lower the CO 2 adsorption energy and facilitate CO 2 adsorption (Fig. 5b), which agreed with our CO 2 adsorption curves shown in Fig. 3d.As we known, the intermediates among the photoconversion of CO 2 to hydrocarbon might contain COOH, CHO, CH 2 O, CH 3 O, and so on.Among them, CHO reacted with H and e -to generate CH 2 O; then, CH 2 O reacted with H and e - to generate CH 3 O; finally, CH 3 O reacted with H and e -to generate CH 4 45.Therefore, the most appropriate process of CO 2 photocatalytic reduction to CO was via COOH intermediate, which could be divided into the following three steps 4647484950 both carbon coating and carbon doping of catalysts could lower Gibbs free energy, while the synergistic effect of both carbon-types could minimize the energy barrier.Therefore, it could be deduced that the main function for doped carbon was that prevent charge recombination in the bulk, facilitate CO 2 adsorption, and decrease Gibbs's free energy for CO 2 reduction to CO, while coated carbon possessed the similar function but accelerating surface carriers migration, but had smaller and greater effect on fascinating CO 2 adsorption and decreasing photocatalytic reaction energy barrier.

All reagents used in this experiment were analytical grade and used without further purification.Typically, MgCl 2 6H 2 O, InCl 3 4H 2 O, thioacetamide (TAA) and glucose were dissolved in 30 mL deionized water.After 30 min magnetic stirring, the resulting mixture was transferred into a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and maintained at 160 C for 24 h in an oven.After natural cooling, the product was alternately centrifuged and washed with distilled water and ethanol, dried at 60 C for 10 h and calcined at 450 C for 6 h in nitrogen atmosphere with a heating rate of 3 C/min.When adding 2, 4 and 6 mmol of glucose and keeping other parameters unchanged, we correspondingly synthesized pure or carbonmodified MgIn 2 S 4 , and labeled them as MgIn 2 S 4 -C1, MgIn 2 S 4 -C2 and MgIn 2 S 4 -C3, respectively. 2.1.2Preparation of MgIn 2 S 4 -SC.In a typical synthesis, the asprepared MgIn 2 S 4 and 4 mmol glucose were ultrasonically dispersed in 30 mL deionized water.Whereafter, the suspension was drastically magnetic stirred for 30 min at room temperature, and then transferred to a 50 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and maintained at 160 C for 24 h in an oven.After natural cooling, the product was alternately centrifuged and washed with distilled water and ethanol, dried at 60 C for 10 h and calcined at 450 C for 6 h in nitrogen atmosphere.The as-obtained sample was marked as MgIn 2 S 4 -SC.The schematic illustration of the preparation process for samples was exhibited in Scheme.S1. The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of samples were evaluated by a Bruker D8 focus with Cu K radiation (40 kV/40 mA).Raman measurements were gotten on a confocal laser micro-Raman spectrometer (Renishaw inVia, England).X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was recorded on An ESCALAB 250xi (ThermoFsher, England) electron spectrometer to investigate Chemical compositions and states.All binding energies were calibrated using the C 1 s peak (284.8 eV) arising from the surface adventitious carbon.The morphologies and microstructure of the samples were observed on a scanning electron microscope (SEM, ZEISS SUPRA55, Germany) and a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEM2100), respectively.EDX elemental mapping was conducted on a PXFORD INCA X-ACT (England) to visualize the elemental compositions.UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were obtained by using a Varian Cary 5000 UV-vis spectrophotometer to study optic property.An ASAP 2020 analyzer (Micromeritics, USA) was employed to investigate the CO 2 adsorption capacity.The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface areas and pore diameter distribution were analyzed by nitrogen adsorption-desorption (Micromeritics ASAP 2460, USA).The photoluminescence emission (PL) and photoluminescence excitation (PLE) spectra were carried out by a Hitachi F-4600 fluorescence spectrophotometer with a xenon lamp (400 V, 150 W) as an excitation source.The luminescence decay curve was measured on a spectrofluorometer (HORIBA, JOBIN YVON FL3-21).All the measurements were measured at room temperature. The photocatalytic activities of as-prepared samples were tested by photocatalytic CO 2 reduction experiment under visible light ( nm) irradiation, which was conducted in a 300 mL reaction cell.A W Xe lamp (Perfectlight, China) was utilized as light source and a UV light cut off filter was used to obtain visible light.0.05 g photocatalyst was evenly dispersed on a watch glass with an area of about 28 cm 2 .1.70 g NaHCO 3 was put into the reaction cell followed by thorough vacuum treatment.Prior to light irradiation, 15 mL H 2 SO 4 (4 M) aqueous solution was injected into the cell to achieve CO 2 gas (1 atm in reaction cell) via reaction between NaHCO 3 and H 2 SO 4 .At given time intervals, 1 mL resulting gas was collected by a needle tubing and then qualitatively analyzed by a GC 9790II gas chromatograph (Zhejiang Fuli Analytical Instrument Co., Ltd., China) equipped with a GDX502 flame ionization detector and a TDX-01 thermal conductivity detector.The production yield was determined based on a calibration curve. To determine the source of the carbon in the photocatalytic products (CO), isotopic experiments and control experiments were carried out.The isotopic experiment was conducted under the same conditions with using 13 CO 2 (purchased from Beijing Gaisi Chemical Gases Company) instead of 12 CO 2 (produced by the reaction between NaHCO 3 and H 2 SO 4 ), and MgIn 2 S 4 -C2 was taken as a model.MgIn 2 S 4 -C3, with highest carbon content among all samples, was taken for control experiments, which was performed under four conditions: (i) experiment with MgIn 2 S 4 -C3 sample, NaHCO 3 and H 2 SO 4 aqueous solution, but without light illumination; (ii) experiment with NaHCO 3 , H 2 SO aqueous solution and light illumination, but without MgIn 2 S 4 -C3 sample; (iii) experiment with MgIn 2 S 4 -C3 sample, light illumination and purging argon in the reaction cell, but without NaHCO 3 and H 2 SO aqueous solution; (iv) experiment with MgIn 2 S 4 -C3 sample, light illumination, H 2 SO 4 aqueous solution and purging argon in the reaction cell, but without NaHCO 3 , respectively.To evaluate the stability, the photocatalytic performance of MgIn 2 S 4 , MgIn 2 S 4 -C2 and MgIn 2 S 4 -SC samples were reevaluated in the light of the aforementioned procedure. The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) and Mott-Schottky curve was recorded on an electrochemical analyzer (CHI660E, Shanghai) equipped with a standard three-electrode system.Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) and platinum (Pt) wire were taken as reference electrode and the counter electrode, respectively.A 300 W Xe arc lamp (with a UV light cut off filter ( 420 nm)) was used as light source.The electrolyte solution was Na 2 SO 4 (0.1 M) aqueous solution.To prepare the working electrodes, 10 mg of sample was dispersed in 800 l ethanol.Subsequently, the obtained suspension liquid was drop-coated on a ITO glass with size of 20 mm 40 mm, and dried at 60 C for 10 h in the air. Theoretical calculations were performed using density functional theory (DFT) as implemented in the \"Vienna ab initio simulation package\" (VASP) code 29.Three dimensional periodic boundary conditions were used to approximate an infinite solid.Bader analysis was used for determination of the charges on the atoms.The energy cutoff is set to be 500 eV, and the atomic positions are allowed to relax until the force was less than 0.04 eV/A, respectively.The k-points were 2 2 2 for structure optimizations energy.The valence electron configurations applied in this work are 2s 2 2p 2 (C), 2s 2 2p 4 (O), 3 s 2 (Mg), 3s 2 3p 6 (S) and 4d 10 4s 2 5p 1 (In), respectively.The supercell was constructed by a twolayer 2 2 MgIn 2 S 4 (0 0 1) slab and a 20 A vacuum, in order to avoid the interaction between periodic structures, and the bottom four layers of atoms were fixed.The effective conduction electron masses was evaluated from the second derivative of the highest point of the VB band and the lowest point of the CB band according to E 2 k 2 /2m e m, where m e denoted the free electron mass (9.1 10 -19 kg) 30. The formation energies were calculated by the following formula 31: Where E tot and E pristine represented the total energies of C-doped and pristine structure, respectively.N was the number of C, and C was the energies of single C atom. CO 2 reduction was considered as followed: Here, the asterisk () represents the surface substrate active site.The free energies of the CO 2 reduction steps (CRR) were calculated by the equation 32: G EDFT EZPE -TS, where EDFT is the DFT electronic energy difference of each step, EZPE and S are the correction of zero-point energy and the variation of entropy, respectively, which are obtained by vibration analysis, T is the temperature (T 300 K)."}, {"llm generation": "visible light (420 nm)", "source": "The photocatalytic activities of our materials were assessed by CO 2 reduction to CO under visible light ( 420 nm) irradiation in a gas-solid reaction system without any co-catalysts or sacrificial agents.", "context": "XRD of MgIn 2 S 4 showed peaks at 14.3 , 27.6 , 33.5 , 43.9 , 47.8 , and 51.3 (see Fig. 1a), which correspond to (1 1 1), (1 1 3), (0 0 4), (1 1 5), (0 4 4), and (2 4 4) planes of cubic MgIn 2 S 4 (according to the ICSD card number 53096), respectively.No other peaks were observed, confirming the high purity of the MgIn 2 S 4 sample.XRD peaks at 27.6 for the MgIn 2 S 4 -Cx series shifted to smaller angles, whereas the XRD pattern of MgIn 2 S 4 -SC remained unchanged, compared to that of pristine MgIn 2 S 4 .It could be speculated that carbon is incorporated into the MgIn 2 S 4 -Cx lattice. Raman spectra of MgIn 2 S 4 -C2 and MgIn 2 S 4 -SC samples showed characteristics D and G bands of carbon-based materials at 1370 and 1587 cm -1 (Fig. 1b), which corresponded to disordered and ordered sp 2bonded carbon atoms, respectively 33.Moreover, a 2 nm carbon layer was detected on the edges of MgIn 2 S 4 -C2 and MgIn 2 S 4 -SC but not of the MgIn 2 S 4 sample (Fig. 1c-e).Additionally, after carbon incorporation, the color of the material changed from red (which was a color of pristine MgIn 2 S 4 ) to black (color of the modified MgIn 2 S 4 -C2 and MgIn 2 S 4 -SC samples), which resulted in significantly enhanced lightharvesting ability in the visible region (Fig. S4).XPS spectra were corrected using binding energy of the C 1 s peak at 284.8 eV arising from adventitious carbon of the XPS instrument.All samples showed peaks belonging to Mg, In, S, O, and C (Fig. S5).The O 1 s peak was attributed to O 2 and H 2 O adsorbed on the surface of sample.Time-dependent XPS analysis with Ar sputtering showed a chemical configuration of carbon in our samples (Fig. 2a-c).C 1 s peak intensity decreased upon Ar sputtering for 100 s may be due to organic carbon decomposition.After 100 s, C 1 s peak intensity remained almost unchanged.However, C 1 s peak of the MgIn 2 S 4 -C2 sample shifted to lower binding energy (equal to 284.4 eV), while positions of the C 1 s peaks for the MgIn 2 S 4 and MgIn 2 S 4 -SC samples remained the same (284.8eV).Fig. 2d displays high-resolution XPS spectra after 500 s of Ar sputtering.Because the samples were pressed into small pellets, it was hard to eliminate peaks corresponding to the adventitious carbon on the particle surfaces regardless of the Ar sputtering duration.Therefore, the peak at 284.8 eV observed in the XPS spectrum of the MgIn 2 S 4 sample was ascribed to the adventitious carbon from instrument.The peak at 284.8 eV visible in the XPS spectrum of the MgIn 2 S 4 -SC sample was attributed to adventitious carbon from instrument and carbon coated on the surface.Peaks at 284.8 and 284.4 eV detected in the XPS spectrum of MgIn 2 S 4 -C2 were assigned to carbon atoms on the surface and in the lattice, respectively 21,343536.Positions of high-resolution In 3d and S 2p peaks detected in the XPS spectra of MgIn 2 S 4 and MgIn 2 S 4 -SC samples were almost identical, while In 3d and S 2p peaks of MgIn 2 S 4 -C2 shifted to lower energies (Fig. 2e-f).These results confirmed that MgIn 2 S 4 -C2 contained both surface and doped carbon, resulting in the shift of XRD and XPS peaks, while the MgIn 2 S 4 -SC sample had only carbon on the surface. The photocatalytic activities of our materials were assessed by CO 2 reduction to CO under visible light ( 420 nm) irradiation in a gas-solid reaction system without any co-catalysts or sacrificial agents.In sharp contrast, the CO 2 conversion activity was markedly enhanced for MgIn 2 S 4 -CX, with the highest CO evolution rate of 1.171 mol/g/h delivered by MgIn 2 S 4 -C2, which was 19.5 times higher than the production rate under the presence of unmodified MgIn 2 S 4 (which was equal to 0.057 mol/g/h).CO production rate under the presence of the MgIn 2 S 4 -SC catalyst was 0.458 mol/g/h, which was 7.03 times higher than that of MgIn 2 S 4 (Fig. 3a-b).Particularly, CO production rate of MgIn 2 S 4 -Cx and MgIn 2 S 4 -SC with unit specific surface area (S BET , Fig. S6) was higher than that of pristine MgIn 2 S 4 , indicating S BET was not the cause for the enhanced photocatalytic performance of MgIn 2 S 4 -Cx and MgIn 2 S 4 -SC.In the CO 2 photocatalytic reduction process over all samples, no H 2 and CH 4 was detected, which may be resulted from the selective reduction of CO 2 over photocatalysts 37. Isotopic tracing experiment using 13 CO 2 coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) showed peaks at m/z equal to 29 and 45, which was attributed to 13 CO and 13 CO 2 (Fig. 3c).Compared to the pure 13 CO 2 , the signal at m/z 29 has increased after photoreaction over MgIn 2 S 4 -C2 sample under 13 CO 2 atmosphere 38.A very low CO evolution rate (7.57 of the normal CO amount), was observed in experiments iii and iv over MgIn 2 S 4 -C3 sample (contained the most carbon among all of samples), which could be neglected.Moreover, no CO was detected in the control photocatalytic CO reduction experiment (i) conducted with MgIn 2 S 4 -C3 sample, NaHCO and H 2 SO 4 aqueous solution, but without light illumination.To determine the carbon content of as-prepared samples, the MgIn 2 S 4 -C2 sample is eroded by aqua regia and remove MgIn 2 S 4 .The mass ratios of carbon to MgIn 2 S 4 in MgIn 2 S 4 -C2 sample before and after photoreaction are approximatively 6.2 and 7.6, respectively, the increase of which may be due to the deviation.Thus, it can be deduced that the Boudouard reaction between surface coated carbon and CO 2 may never take place.These results confirmed the CO photocatalytic formation under the presence of MgIn 2 S 4 -C2.Cycling experiments showed that MgIn 2 S 4 -Cx and MgIn 2 S 4 -SC possessed better stability than MgIn 2 S 4 ; thus, doping and coating the samples with carbon improved photocatalyst stability (Fig. S9).Fig. 3.

CO 2 adsorption ability of a catalyst is very important for its photocatalytic performance during CO 2 reduction reaction 39.CO 2 adsorption capacity of MgIn 2 S 4 -Cx and MgIn 2 S 4 -SC was stronger than MgIn 2 S 4 (Fig. 3d).As glucose content (x) increased, CO 2 adsorption capacity of MgIn 2 S 4 -Cx catalysts was improved.Thus, carbon modification of MgIn 2 S 4 -Cx and MgIn 2 S 4 -SC samples benefited CO 2 adsorption.On the other hand, the photogenerated charge separation efficiency is also crucial for photocatalytic performance.In general, low photoluminescence emission intensity explains the low recombination rate of photoinduced electron-hole pairs 4041.The PL emission intensity of MgIn 2 S 4 -SC was higher than that of MgIn 2 S 4 -C2 but lower than that of MgIn 2 S 4 (Fig. 4a).The average charge lifetime of MgIn 2 S 4 -SC was also shorter than that of MgIn 2 S 4 and longer than that of MgIn 2 S 4 -C2 (Fig. 4b).Shorter lifetime indicates the presence of a nonradiative pathway, which in the case of MgIn 2 S 4 -C2 very likely involved delocalization of electrons from MgIn 2 S 4 to C 20, supporting the most efficient charge separation of MgIn 2 S 4 -C2.The arc radii of the three samples were in the following order: MgIn 2 S 4 MgIn 2 S 4 -SC MgIn 2 S 4 -C2 (Fig. 4c).The smaller the radius, the higher the charge transfer efficiency typically is 42.Thus, the presence of carbon in the bulk and on the surface promoted charge separation and migration, but the effect of doped carbon was greater. To further understand the role of carbon in the bulk and on the surface of the catalyst in photocatalytic activity enhancement, we performed theoretical calculations using density functional theory (DFT) coupled with a plane-wave method.Our goal was to predict the charge distribution, effective conduction electron masses, CO 2 adsorption energy and Gibbs free energy for CO 2 conversion to CO.To confirm the location of C atoms in the MgIn 2 S 4 crystalline structure, we considered four possible ways of introducing carbon atom into MgIn 2 S 4 , namely, the C atom substituted Mg, In and S atom, and C doped in interstitial position.The model structures of MgIn 2 S 4 and C-doped MgIn 2 S 4 were displayed in Fig. S10.We calculated the formation energies (E f ) of a doped carbon atom in substitutional and interstitial configurations to characterize the stability of the carbon-doped MgIn 2 S 4 model (Table S1). The calculated E f value of interstitial doped C was lower than that of the substituted one, so C-doped MgIn 2 S 4 was more likely to exist as a C int -5 model.As shown in Fig. 5a, blue and yellow sphere represent charge lost and equivalent charge gain.Thus, C atom incorporated into the MgIn 2 S 4 lattice formed a stable covalent bond with adjacent S atoms, which allowed electrons to transfer directly from S to C atoms.q value, which corresponded to the carried charge of the C atoms, was calculated to be 0.82 eV using the Bader method 43.Effective conduction electron masses for pure MgIn 2 S 4 and C int -5 model were also simulated; their values were 0.120 and 0.075, respectively.Smaller effective mass favors high mobility of the charge carriers 44.Therefore, we believe that interstitial C doping caused charge redistribution and electron delocalization, both of which facilitated local charge separation, which, in turn, prevented charge recombination in the bulk. Presence of doped and coated carbon could lower the CO 2 adsorption energy and facilitate CO 2 adsorption (Fig. 5b), which agreed with our CO 2 adsorption curves shown in Fig. 3d.As we known, the intermediates among the photoconversion of CO 2 to hydrocarbon might contain COOH, CHO, CH 2 O, CH 3 O, and so on.Among them, CHO reacted with H and e -to generate CH 2 O; then, CH 2 O reacted with H and e - to generate CH 3 O; finally, CH 3 O reacted with H and e -to generate CH 4 45.Therefore, the most appropriate process of CO 2 photocatalytic reduction to CO was via COOH intermediate, which could be divided into the following three steps 4647484950 both carbon coating and carbon doping of catalysts could lower Gibbs free energy, while the synergistic effect of both carbon-types could minimize the energy barrier.Therefore, it could be deduced that the main function for doped carbon was that prevent charge recombination in the bulk, facilitate CO 2 adsorption, and decrease Gibbs's free energy for CO 2 reduction to CO, while coated carbon possessed the similar function but accelerating surface carriers migration, but had smaller and greater effect on fascinating CO 2 adsorption and decreasing photocatalytic reaction energy barrier.

Raman spectra of MgIn 2 S 4 -C2 and MgIn 2 S 4 -SC samples showed characteristics D and G bands of carbon-based materials at 1370 and 1587 cm -1 (Fig. 1b), which corresponded to disordered and ordered sp 2bonded carbon atoms, respectively 33.Moreover, a 2 nm carbon layer was detected on the edges of MgIn 2 S 4 -C2 and MgIn 2 S 4 -SC but not of the MgIn 2 S 4 sample (Fig. 1c-e).Additionally, after carbon incorporation, the color of the material changed from red (which was a color of pristine MgIn 2 S 4 ) to black (color of the modified MgIn 2 S 4 -C2 and MgIn 2 S 4 -SC samples), which resulted in significantly enhanced lightharvesting ability in the visible region (Fig. S4).XPS spectra were corrected using binding energy of the C 1 s peak at 284.8 eV arising from adventitious carbon of the XPS instrument.All samples showed peaks belonging to Mg, In, S, O, and C (Fig. S5).The O 1 s peak was attributed to O 2 and H 2 O adsorbed on the surface of sample.Time-dependent XPS analysis with Ar sputtering showed a chemical configuration of carbon in our samples (Fig. 2a-c).C 1 s peak intensity decreased upon Ar sputtering for 100 s may be due to organic carbon decomposition.After 100 s, C 1 s peak intensity remained almost unchanged.However, C 1 s peak of the MgIn 2 S 4 -C2 sample shifted to lower binding energy (equal to 284.4 eV), while positions of the C 1 s peaks for the MgIn 2 S 4 and MgIn 2 S 4 -SC samples remained the same (284.8eV).Fig. 2d displays high-resolution XPS spectra after 500 s of Ar sputtering.Because the samples were pressed into small pellets, it was hard to eliminate peaks corresponding to the adventitious carbon on the particle surfaces regardless of the Ar sputtering duration.Therefore, the peak at 284.8 eV observed in the XPS spectrum of the MgIn 2 S 4 sample was ascribed to the adventitious carbon from instrument.The peak at 284.8 eV visible in the XPS spectrum of the MgIn 2 S 4 -SC sample was attributed to adventitious carbon from instrument and carbon coated on the surface.Peaks at 284.8 and 284.4 eV detected in the XPS spectrum of MgIn 2 S 4 -C2 were assigned to carbon atoms on the surface and in the lattice, respectively 21,343536.Positions of high-resolution In 3d and S 2p peaks detected in the XPS spectra of MgIn 2 S 4 and MgIn 2 S 4 -SC samples were almost identical, while In 3d and S 2p peaks of MgIn 2 S 4 -C2 shifted to lower energies (Fig. 2e-f).These results confirmed that MgIn 2 S 4 -C2 contained both surface and doped carbon, resulting in the shift of XRD and XPS peaks, while the MgIn 2 S 4 -SC sample had only carbon on the surface. The photocatalytic activities of our materials were assessed by CO 2 reduction to CO under visible light ( 420 nm) irradiation in a gas-solid reaction system without any co-catalysts or sacrificial agents.In sharp contrast, the CO 2 conversion activity was markedly enhanced for MgIn 2 S 4 -CX, with the highest CO evolution rate of 1.171 mol/g/h delivered by MgIn 2 S 4 -C2, which was 19.5 times higher than the production rate under the presence of unmodified MgIn 2 S 4 (which was equal to 0.057 mol/g/h).CO production rate under the presence of the MgIn 2 S 4 -SC catalyst was 0.458 mol/g/h, which was 7.03 times higher than that of MgIn 2 S 4 (Fig. 3a-b).Particularly, CO production rate of MgIn 2 S 4 -Cx and MgIn 2 S 4 -SC with unit specific surface area (S BET , Fig. S6) was higher than that of pristine MgIn 2 S 4 , indicating S BET was not the cause for the enhanced photocatalytic performance of MgIn 2 S 4 -Cx and MgIn 2 S 4 -SC.In the CO 2 photocatalytic reduction process over all samples, no H 2 and CH 4 was detected, which may be resulted from the selective reduction of CO 2 over photocatalysts 37. Isotopic tracing experiment using 13 CO 2 coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) showed peaks at m/z equal to 29 and 45, which was attributed to 13 CO and 13 CO 2 (Fig. 3c).Compared to the pure 13 CO 2 , the signal at m/z 29 has increased after photoreaction over MgIn 2 S 4 -C2 sample under 13 CO 2 atmosphere 38.A very low CO evolution rate (7.57 of the normal CO amount), was observed in experiments iii and iv over MgIn 2 S 4 -C3 sample (contained the most carbon among all of samples), which could be neglected.Moreover, no CO was detected in the control photocatalytic CO reduction experiment (i) conducted with MgIn 2 S 4 -C3 sample, NaHCO and H 2 SO 4 aqueous solution, but without light illumination.To determine the carbon content of as-prepared samples, the MgIn 2 S 4 -C2 sample is eroded by aqua regia and remove MgIn 2 S 4 .The mass ratios of carbon to MgIn 2 S 4 in MgIn 2 S 4 -C2 sample before and after photoreaction are approximatively 6.2 and 7.6, respectively, the increase of which may be due to the deviation.Thus, it can be deduced that the Boudouard reaction between surface coated carbon and CO 2 may never take place.These results confirmed the CO photocatalytic formation under the presence of MgIn 2 S 4 -C2.Cycling experiments showed that MgIn 2 S 4 -Cx and MgIn 2 S 4 -SC possessed better stability than MgIn 2 S 4 ; thus, doping and coating the samples with carbon improved photocatalyst stability (Fig. S9).Fig. 3.

CO 2 adsorption ability of a catalyst is very important for its photocatalytic performance during CO 2 reduction reaction 39.CO 2 adsorption capacity of MgIn 2 S 4 -Cx and MgIn 2 S 4 -SC was stronger than MgIn 2 S 4 (Fig. 3d).As glucose content (x) increased, CO 2 adsorption capacity of MgIn 2 S 4 -Cx catalysts was improved.Thus, carbon modification of MgIn 2 S 4 -Cx and MgIn 2 S 4 -SC samples benefited CO 2 adsorption.On the other hand, the photogenerated charge separation efficiency is also crucial for photocatalytic performance.In general, low photoluminescence emission intensity explains the low recombination rate of photoinduced electron-hole pairs 4041.The PL emission intensity of MgIn 2 S 4 -SC was higher than that of MgIn 2 S 4 -C2 but lower than that of MgIn 2 S 4 (Fig. 4a).The average charge lifetime of MgIn 2 S 4 -SC was also shorter than that of MgIn 2 S 4 and longer than that of MgIn 2 S 4 -C2 (Fig. 4b).Shorter lifetime indicates the presence of a nonradiative pathway, which in the case of MgIn 2 S 4 -C2 very likely involved delocalization of electrons from MgIn 2 S 4 to C 20, supporting the most efficient charge separation of MgIn 2 S 4 -C2.The arc radii of the three samples were in the following order: MgIn 2 S 4 MgIn 2 S 4 -SC MgIn 2 S 4 -C2 (Fig. 4c).The smaller the radius, the higher the charge transfer efficiency typically is 42.Thus, the presence of carbon in the bulk and on the surface promoted charge separation and migration, but the effect of doped carbon was greater. To further understand the role of carbon in the bulk and on the surface of the catalyst in photocatalytic activity enhancement, we performed theoretical calculations using density functional theory (DFT) coupled with a plane-wave method.Our goal was to predict the charge distribution, effective conduction electron masses, CO 2 adsorption energy and Gibbs free energy for CO 2 conversion to CO.To confirm the location of C atoms in the MgIn 2 S 4 crystalline structure, we considered four possible ways of introducing carbon atom into MgIn 2 S 4 , namely, the C atom substituted Mg, In and S atom, and C doped in interstitial position.The model structures of MgIn 2 S 4 and C-doped MgIn 2 S 4 were displayed in Fig. S10.We calculated the formation energies (E f ) of a doped carbon atom in substitutional and interstitial configurations to characterize the stability of the carbon-doped MgIn 2 S 4 model (Table S1). The calculated E f value of interstitial doped C was lower than that of the substituted one, so C-doped MgIn 2 S 4 was more likely to exist as a C int -5 model.As shown in Fig. 5a, blue and yellow sphere represent charge lost and equivalent charge gain.Thus, C atom incorporated into the MgIn 2 S 4 lattice formed a stable covalent bond with adjacent S atoms, which allowed electrons to transfer directly from S to C atoms.q value, which corresponded to the carried charge of the C atoms, was calculated to be 0.82 eV using the Bader method 43.Effective conduction electron masses for pure MgIn 2 S 4 and C int -5 model were also simulated; their values were 0.120 and 0.075, respectively.Smaller effective mass favors high mobility of the charge carriers 44.Therefore, we believe that interstitial C doping caused charge redistribution and electron delocalization, both of which facilitated local charge separation, which, in turn, prevented charge recombination in the bulk. Presence of doped and coated carbon could lower the CO 2 adsorption energy and facilitate CO 2 adsorption (Fig. 5b), which agreed with our CO 2 adsorption curves shown in Fig. 3d.As we known, the intermediates among the photoconversion of CO 2 to hydrocarbon might contain COOH, CHO, CH 2 O, CH 3 O, and so on.Among them, CHO reacted with H and e -to generate CH 2 O; then, CH 2 O reacted with H and e - to generate CH 3 O; finally, CH 3 O reacted with H and e -to generate CH 4 45.Therefore, the most appropriate process of CO 2 photocatalytic reduction to CO was via COOH intermediate, which could be divided into the following three steps 4647484950 both carbon coating and carbon doping of catalysts could lower Gibbs free energy, while the synergistic effect of both carbon-types could minimize the energy barrier.Therefore, it could be deduced that the main function for doped carbon was that prevent charge recombination in the bulk, facilitate CO 2 adsorption, and decrease Gibbs's free energy for CO 2 reduction to CO, while coated carbon possessed the similar function but accelerating surface carriers migration, but had smaller and greater effect on fascinating CO 2 adsorption and decreasing photocatalytic reaction energy barrier.
