The photocatalytic performances of the GN-x/BFW heterostructures were evaluated in a gas-closed circulation system with high-purity CO2 reactant under irradiation from a 300 W Xe-lamp.The reaction product was injected into a gas chromatography at given intervals (1 h).Furthermore, the quantitative calculation was according to the external standard method.Only CO could be observed in the reaction system.Among the samples, the pure BFW and g-C3N4 exhibited the moderate activity for CO2 photoreduction with a CO generation rate of 5.2 mol h -1 g -1 and 8.9 mol h -1 g -1 , respectively.After in-situ growing procedure, the obtained GN-x/BFW heterostructure samples exhibited substantially enhanced CO2 photoreduction performance.Strikingly, the GN-5.0/BFWcatalysts presented the highest CO evolution rate of 43 mol h -1 g -1 , which was about 8.3 times higher than that of BFW, 4.8 times higher than that of pure g-C3N4.The coupling effect among BFW and g-C3N4 significantly promoted the CO evolution.Moreover, the catalytic performance of mechanically mixed BFW and g-C3N4 (GN-5/BFW-m) was evaluated at the same condition.As shown in Fig. S2, showed a low photocatalytic efficiency of the GN-5/BFW-m sample (10.2 mol h -1 g -1 ) was much lower than that of the GN-5.0/BFWheterostructure, which implicated that intimate interfaces could be obtained by coupling BFW with g-C3N4 to form heterojunction in the in-situ growing sample rather than form loose interfaces in the mechanically mixed sample.Compared to some Bi-base or g-C3N4-based materials containing CO2 conversion systems (Table S1), the obtained CO2 photoreduction rate was relatively high, but not the highest.However, in our work CO was the main product, the reaction system was simple and the synthesis process of the composites was also simple, which will increase its applied prospects in the future.The enhanced photocatalytic efficiency of GN-x/BFW composites could be attributed to (1) the expanding sunlight response region; (2) the formed heterojunctions facilitating the efficient separation and transfer of charge carriers; The CO2 photoreduction performance over GN-5.0/BFW was carried out for 3 cycles to evaluate the stability. As shown in Fig. 4c, no significant loss in the CO evolution rate was observed, reflecting the high stability of the GN-5.0/BFWcatalyst.Furthermore, XRD patterns and SEM were measured to further investigate the stability of GN-5.0/BFW composite.As shown in Fig. 4d, no significant changes in the XRD of the fresh and used GN-5.0/BFWheterojunctions was observed.The SEM images (Fig. S3) of used GN-5.0/BFWcomposite (48 h) still exhibited uniform and integrated morphology without g-C3N4 falling off.Generally, different reaction products could be obtained by choosing different catalysts, changing the structural features of the catalysts as well as the reaction conditions. 16No CH4 was found in the present experimental system, manifesting no stacking the photogenerated electrons.Electrochemical reactions involved in CO2 reduction with water are listed as follow 17 : CO2 H2O 2e -CO 2OH - CO2 6H2O 8e-CH4 8OH - from which it is easy to find that each CH4 molecule evolution needs eight e -, while only two e -for each CO molecule.The CO2-to-CO conversion process might be a more favored reaction in our system.Therefore, the GN-x/BFW heterostructure exhibited high selective photoreduction of CO2 to CO. The photo-absorption properties of as-obtained photocatalysts were studied by UV-vis DRS.As shown in Fig. 5, all the catalysts displayed light absorption from UV to visible light region, which indicated they could be as visible-light-induced photocatalysts.Coupling g-C3N4 with BFW, the stronger absorptions of the composites were obviously observed compared with pure g-C3N4 and BFW samples.And the absorption intensity increased with the increasing g-C3N4 content.The obvious red shift 10.1002/cctc.201800959 This article is protected by copyright.All rights reserved. of GN-x/BFW composites might be ascribed to the interaction from the hybridization between BFW and g-C3N4. Fig. 5. UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of g-C3N4, BFW and GN-x/BFW composite. The photogenerated charge transfer efficiency was usually evaluated by the photoelectrochemical method.Fig. 6a shows the transient photocurrent responses of the BFW, g-C3N4 and GN-5/BFW heterostructure with five on-off cycles.As is known, the rapid separation efficiency of photo-induced e -and h corresponds to the high photocurrent density 18 .The photocurrent responses intensity of GN-5/BFW heterojunction was higher than that of the pure BFW and g-C3N4 under visible irradiation, suggesting that the heterostructure could achieve more rapid charge separation.The Nyquist impedance plots was used to further the migration of the photoinduced charge carriers.Generally, the arc radius on the EIS Nyquist plot represents the resistance of electron transfer.A smaller arc radius reflects a better migration and transfer efficiency of photoexcited e --h pairs 19 .As shown in Fig. 6b, the GN-5/BFW composite showed the smallest arc radius among the pure BFW, g-C3N4 and the GN-5/BFW heterojunction composite, which demonstrated a stronger electronic conductivity in the GN-5/BFW heterostructure.The superior conductivity 10.1002/cctc.201800959 This article is protected by copyright.All rights reserved. would be conductive to the transfer of photoinduced carriers.The results of transient photocurrent response and EIS confirmed the existence of an internal electric field derived from the strong interaction between BFW and g-C3N4, which could manipulate photoexcited charge carriers into directional migration, thus, achieve the efficient separation of photoinduced e --h pairs, resulting a superior photocatalytic activity. The Mott-Schottky (MS) measurements by using the impedance-potential method was carried out to evaluate the electronic potentials of pure BFW and g-C3N4.As shown in Fig. 7, the Mott-Schottky plots of the BFW and g-C3N4 showed positive slopes, respectively, which signified both were n-type semiconductors.The flat band potentials of BFW and g-C3N4 estimated from the intercept on the X-axis were about -0.31 and -0.88 V vs Ag/AgCl.The normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) scale were estimated by eq 1: where ENHE is the converted potential, EAg/AgCl is the measured potential and E Ag/AgCl is the standard potential of Ag/AgCl (E Ag/AgCl 0.1976 V).As the Vfb is more 0.2 V positive than CB potential (ECB) for a n-type semiconductor, the calculated ECB of BFW and g-C3N4 were -0.31 and -0.88 eV vs RHE, respectively.The EVB was determined through using eq 2: 10.1002/cctc.201800959 This article is protected by copyright.All rights reserved. Correspondingly, the calculated EVB of BFW and g-C3N4 was 1.76 eV and 1.51 eV, respectively.Different recombination pathways of the photoinduced e -and h could enable different accumulation of h and e -on different valence band and conduction band.The active radicals generated from these active e -and h are involved with the redox reactions.EPR analysis, using DMPO as a spin trapping reagent in methanol or H2O, was carried out to investigate the radicals more intuitively 20 .As shown in Fig. 8a, the EPR signals of DMPO-OH adduct could be observed obviously in the GN-5/BFW photocatalytic system, however, there was a much weaker signal for BFW, and for g-C3N4, no signals can be detected, which clearly implied the GN-5/BFW composite generated more OH radicals than the individual catalyst 2a .Meanwhile, a similar consequence was obtained in the DMPO-O2 analysis.Compared with the single component, the strongest signal of DMPO-O2 could be detected in the present of the GN-5/BFW composite, and the signal of BFW was weaker, almost negligible.Based on the results of the band gap structures and the EPR, the schematic energy band illustration of a Z-scheme separation processes of photoinduced e -/h on the interface between g-C3N4 and BFW were shown in Fig. 9.The BFW exhibited a staggered gap with g-C3N4, and the VB and CB potential were lower than that of g-C3N4. The photoexcited e -from the CB of g-C3N4 would transfer to the CB of BFW, while the holes from the VB of BFW transferred to the VB of g-C3N4, which achieved a spatial separation of charge carriers.Thermodynamically, no O2 -(EO2/O2--0.33 V vs NHE) could be produced on the CB potential of BFW (-0.31 V vs NHE).and H2O/OH (E1.99 V vs NHE) was more positive than the EVB of g-C3N4 (1.51 V vs NHE), it was also inhibited to form OH.However, both O2 -and OH could be found in the presence of GN-5/BFW composite.Therefore, it is indicated that the photocatalytic mechanism in the GN-x/BFW photocatalytic system was a possible Zscheme mechanism.The photogenerated e -in the CB of BFW would combine with the h in the VB of g-C3N4, which retained the excellent reducibility of e -and achieved the separation of charge carriers.Furthermore, the TEOA would be oxidized by the photogenerated holes left on VB.As a result, the recombination of photo-induced charge carriers would be inhibited because of the charge transfer on the interfaces of heterostructures."}, {"llm generation": "GN-x/BFW heterojunction photocatalysts", "source": "A novel GN-x/BFW heterojunction photocatalysts have been synthesized via a in situ solvothermal process.", "context": "A novel GN-x/BFW heterojunction photocatalysts have been synthesized via a in situ solvothermal process.This technique is quite simple and environmentally benign.A tight chemically bonded interface between the BFW and g-C3N4 can be constructed by this approach.The GN-x/BFW heterojunction catalysts exhibited high visible light sensitivity and highly efficient separation and transfer of charge carriers, due to the interface interaction between BFW and g-C3N4.Consequently, the GN-x/BFW heterojunction catalysts showed higher photocatalytic activity than pure BFW and g-C3N4 for the CO2 photoreduction under visible light irradiation.The enhanced photocatalytic performance of GN-x/BFW was ascribed mainly to the effective separation and migration of photoinduced electrons and holes benefiting from a Z-scheme heterojunction.This study provides a promising prospect for developing novel and highly efficient visible-light-driven heterojunction photocatalysts for CO2 photoreduction. protected by copyright.All rights reserved. 10.1002/cctc.201800959AcceptedManuscriptChemCatChemThis article is protected by copyright.All rights reserved.

Finally, the reactor was filled with CO2 at a pressure of 0.8 atm.A 300 W Xe arc lamp (Aulight CEL-HXF300, Beijing) was used as the light source, which was placed at the top of the optical window (about 10 cm, Light intensity I 70 mW cm 2 .).During the photocatalytic process, the reaction system was vigorously stirred by a magnetic stirrer, and the temperature of the reaction system was controlled at 10 C by cooling water circulation.The produced gas was detected and quantified by a gas chromatography (Hope GC 9860) with both TCD and FID detectors."}, {"llm generation": "Xenon", "source": "The photocatalytic performances of the GN-x/BFW heterostructures were evaluated in a gas-closed circulation system with high-purity CO2 reactant under irradiation from a 300 W Xe-lamp.", "context": "The crystalline structures of the as-synthesized samples are analyzed by X-ray diffraction, as shown in Fig. 1.The characteristic peak for the hierarchical g-C3N4 at 27.4 was ascribed to the interlayer-stacking of aromatic systems, indexed as (002) peaks (Fig. 1b), corresponding to the previous reports 1314 .All the XRD diffraction patterns of the GN-x/BFW samples showed the similar diffraction patterns to that of the pure BFW, suggesting that the introduction of g-C3N4 had not an evident influence on the crystalline structure of BFW.However, owning to the low peak intensity and content of g-C3N4, no g-C3N4 diffraction peaks could be detected in the composite samples.The typical morphology of as-prepared materials was analyzed by FE-SEM observation.As shown in Fig. 2a, the pure g-C3N4 sample displayed a typical graphitelike layered morphology with wrinkles and lamellar structures.A regular and uniform octahedron structure of the BFW catalyst was observed by a panoramic view, as shown in Fig. 2b.For the GN-x/BFW heterojunction composites, the composites still exhibited octahedral morphology.While, different from pure BFW, the surfaces of all GN-x/BFW heterojunctions were rough, when g-C3N4 was introduced into the hydrothermal process.The obtained GN-x/BFW octahedra were and encapsulated in numerous densely packed nanostructures.An individual incomplete nano-octahedron demonstrated that the as-prepared GN-2.5/BFW had a core-shell structure (insert in Fig. 2c).With the increasing of g-C3N4 concentration, the aggregated g-C3N4 morphology marked with yellow circles could be observed in Fig. 2e.The elemental mapping results of the GN-5/BFW heterojunction shown in Fig. 3 exhibited that the existence of Bi, Fe, W, C and N, which also indicated that the octahedral BFW samples were embedded in the cotton-like lamellar g-C3N4.The HR-TEM was carried out to investigate the interfacial interaction between g-C3N4 and BFW in the GN-5/BFW composite (Fig. 2f).It could be clearly found that the distinct interface of two phase could be clearly identified by the red dotted line, moreover, g-C3N4 marked with red circles could also be observe in the inner of BFW, which revealed that the actual interface had been formed between BFW and g-C3N4 as well as the atomic level hybridization, rather than a physical mixture.In addition, the double-heterojunction hydria with the g-C3N4 embedded in the inner as well as wrapped in the outer of the BFW could be identified.Generally, the interfacial contact benefits the separation and transfer of photoinduced carriers in photocatalysis 15 .The above analyses revealed the successful fabrication of GN-x/BFW heterojunction composites. The photocatalytic performances of the GN-x/BFW heterostructures were evaluated in a gas-closed circulation system with high-purity CO2 reactant under irradiation from a 300 W Xe-lamp.The reaction product was injected into a gas chromatography at given intervals (1 h).Furthermore, the quantitative calculation was according to the external standard method.Only CO could be observed in the reaction system.Among the samples, the pure BFW and g-C3N4 exhibited the moderate activity for CO2 photoreduction with a CO generation rate of 5.2 mol h -1 g -1 and 8.9 mol h -1 g -1 , respectively.After in-situ growing procedure, the obtained GN-x/BFW heterostructure samples exhibited substantially enhanced CO2 photoreduction performance.Strikingly, the GN-5.0/BFWcatalysts presented the highest CO evolution rate of 43 mol h -1 g -1 , which was about 8.3 times higher than that of BFW, 4.8 times higher than that of pure g-C3N4.The coupling effect among BFW and g-C3N4 significantly promoted the CO evolution.Moreover, the catalytic performance of mechanically mixed BFW and g-C3N4 (GN-5/BFW-m) was evaluated at the same condition.As shown in Fig. S2, showed a low photocatalytic efficiency of the GN-5/BFW-m sample (10.2 mol h -1 g -1 ) was much lower than that of the GN-5.0/BFWheterostructure, which implicated that intimate interfaces could be obtained by coupling BFW with g-C3N4 to form heterojunction in the in-situ growing sample rather than form loose interfaces in the mechanically mixed sample.Compared to some Bi-base or g-C3N4-based materials containing CO2 conversion systems (Table S1), the obtained CO2 photoreduction rate was relatively high, but not the highest.However, in our work CO was the main product, the reaction system was simple and the synthesis process of the composites was also simple, which will increase its applied prospects in the future.The enhanced photocatalytic efficiency of GN-x/BFW composites could be attributed to (1) the expanding sunlight response region; (2) the formed heterojunctions facilitating the efficient separation and transfer of charge carriers; The CO2 photoreduction performance over GN-5.0/BFW was carried out for 3 cycles to evaluate the stability. As shown in Fig. 4c, no significant loss in the CO evolution rate was observed, reflecting the high stability of the GN-5.0/BFWcatalyst.Furthermore, XRD patterns and SEM were measured to further investigate the stability of GN-5.0/BFW composite.As shown in Fig. 4d, no significant changes in the XRD of the fresh and used GN-5.0/BFWheterojunctions was observed.The SEM images (Fig. S3) of used GN-5.0/BFWcomposite (48 h) still exhibited uniform and integrated morphology without g-C3N4 falling off.Generally, different reaction products could be obtained by choosing different catalysts, changing the structural features of the catalysts as well as the reaction conditions. 16No CH4 was found in the present experimental system, manifesting no stacking the photogenerated electrons.Electrochemical reactions involved in CO2 reduction with water are listed as follow 17 : CO2 H2O 2e -CO 2OH - CO2 6H2O 8e-CH4 8OH - from which it is easy to find that each CH4 molecule evolution needs eight e -, while only two e -for each CO molecule.The CO2-to-CO conversion process might be a more favored reaction in our system.Therefore, the GN-x/BFW heterostructure exhibited high selective photoreduction of CO2 to CO. The photo-absorption properties of as-obtained photocatalysts were studied by UV-vis DRS.As shown in Fig. 5, all the catalysts displayed light absorption from UV to visible light region, which indicated they could be as visible-light-induced photocatalysts.Coupling g-C3N4 with BFW, the stronger absorptions of the composites were obviously observed compared with pure g-C3N4 and BFW samples.And the absorption intensity increased with the increasing g-C3N4 content.The obvious red shift 10.1002/cctc.201800959 This article is protected by copyright.All rights reserved. of GN-x/BFW composites might be ascribed to the interaction from the hybridization between BFW and g-C3N4. Fig. 5. UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of g-C3N4, BFW and GN-x/BFW composite. The photogenerated charge transfer efficiency was usually evaluated by the photoelectrochemical method.Fig. 6a shows the transient photocurrent responses of the BFW, g-C3N4 and GN-5/BFW heterostructure with five on-off cycles.As is known, the rapid separation efficiency of photo-induced e -and h corresponds to the high photocurrent density 18 .The photocurrent responses intensity of GN-5/BFW heterojunction was higher than that of the pure BFW and g-C3N4 under visible irradiation, suggesting that the heterostructure could achieve more rapid charge separation.The Nyquist impedance plots was used to further the migration of the photoinduced charge carriers.Generally, the arc radius on the EIS Nyquist plot represents the resistance of electron transfer.A smaller arc radius reflects a better migration and transfer efficiency of photoexcited e --h pairs 19 .As shown in Fig. 6b, the GN-5/BFW composite showed the smallest arc radius among the pure BFW, g-C3N4 and the GN-5/BFW heterojunction composite, which demonstrated a stronger electronic conductivity in the GN-5/BFW heterostructure.The superior conductivity 10.1002/cctc.201800959 This article is protected by copyright.All rights reserved. would be conductive to the transfer of photoinduced carriers.The results of transient photocurrent response and EIS confirmed the existence of an internal electric field derived from the strong interaction between BFW and g-C3N4, which could manipulate photoexcited charge carriers into directional migration, thus, achieve the efficient separation of photoinduced e --h pairs, resulting a superior photocatalytic activity. The Mott-Schottky (MS) measurements by using the impedance-potential method was carried out to evaluate the electronic potentials of pure BFW and g-C3N4.As shown in Fig. 7, the Mott-Schottky plots of the BFW and g-C3N4 showed positive slopes, respectively, which signified both were n-type semiconductors.The flat band potentials of BFW and g-C3N4 estimated from the intercept on the X-axis were about -0.31 and -0.88 V vs Ag/AgCl.The normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) scale were estimated by eq 1: where ENHE is the converted potential, EAg/AgCl is the measured potential and E Ag/AgCl is the standard potential of Ag/AgCl (E Ag/AgCl 0.1976 V).As the Vfb is more 0.2 V positive than CB potential (ECB) for a n-type semiconductor, the calculated ECB of BFW and g-C3N4 were -0.31 and -0.88 eV vs RHE, respectively.The EVB was determined through using eq 2: 10.1002/cctc.201800959 This article is protected by copyright.All rights reserved. Correspondingly, the calculated EVB of BFW and g-C3N4 was 1.76 eV and 1.51 eV, respectively.Different recombination pathways of the photoinduced e -and h could enable different accumulation of h and e -on different valence band and conduction band.The active radicals generated from these active e -and h are involved with the redox reactions.EPR analysis, using DMPO as a spin trapping reagent in methanol or H2O, was carried out to investigate the radicals more intuitively 20 .As shown in Fig. 8a, the EPR signals of DMPO-OH adduct could be observed obviously in the GN-5/BFW photocatalytic system, however, there was a much weaker signal for BFW, and for g-C3N4, no signals can be detected, which clearly implied the GN-5/BFW composite generated more OH radicals than the individual catalyst 2a .Meanwhile, a similar consequence was obtained in the DMPO-O2 analysis.Compared with the single component, the strongest signal of DMPO-O2 could be detected in the present of the GN-5/BFW composite, and the signal of BFW was weaker, almost negligible.Based on the results of the band gap structures and the EPR, the schematic energy band illustration of a Z-scheme separation processes of photoinduced e -/h on the interface between g-C3N4 and BFW were shown in Fig. 9.The BFW exhibited a staggered gap with g-C3N4, and the VB and CB potential were lower than that of g-C3N4. The photoexcited e -from the CB of g-C3N4 would transfer to the CB of BFW, while the holes from the VB of BFW transferred to the VB of g-C3N4, which achieved a spatial separation of charge carriers.Thermodynamically, no O2 -(EO2/O2--0.33 V vs NHE) could be produced on the CB potential of BFW (-0.31 V vs NHE).and H2O/OH (E1.99 V vs NHE) was more positive than the EVB of g-C3N4 (1.51 V vs NHE), it was also inhibited to form OH.However, both O2 -and OH could be found in the presence of GN-5/BFW composite.Therefore, it is indicated that the photocatalytic mechanism in the GN-x/BFW photocatalytic system was a possible Zscheme mechanism.The photogenerated e -in the CB of BFW would combine with the h in the VB of g-C3N4, which retained the excellent reducibility of e -and achieved the separation of charge carriers.Furthermore, the TEOA would be oxidized by the photogenerated holes left on VB.As a result, the recombination of photo-induced charge carriers would be inhibited because of the charge transfer on the interfaces of heterostructures."}], "reaction medium": [{"llm generation": "Gas", "source": "Finally, the reactor was filled with CO2 at a pressure of 0.8 atm.", "context": "The hierarchical g-C3N4 was synthesized from preorganized hydrogen bonded supramolecular precursors 13 .As follows: 10 mmol 2,4-diamino-6-methyl-1,3,5triazine and 10 mmol cyanuric acid were mixed in 500 ml deionized water and vigorously stirred for 48 h.Then the suspension was centrifuged and washed with deionized water several times.The resulting powders were dried at 60 C 48 h under vacuum conditions and calcined at 550 C for 4 h at a heating rate of 2 K min -1 under N2 atmosphere.
