The La-modified TiO 2 nanoparticles were prepared by a sol-gel method with Ti(OBu) 4 as the titanium source 29.10mL of Ti(OBu) 4 was dissolved in 40 mL of anhydrous ethanol in a dry atmosphere, and then the mixed solution of Ti(OBu) 4 and ethanol was added dropwise into another mixture solution consisting of 10 mL water, 10 mL of anhydrous ethanol, and a certain amount of La 2 O 3 dissolved in 2 mL of 70 HNO 3 under vigorous stirring.0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 and 5 denote the samples in which the molar ratio of La to Ti was 0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05, respectively, during catalyst preparation.Subsequently, the mixed solution was stirred in a closed beaker at room temperature for 3 h to carry out further hydrolysis.Then, the yellowish transparent sol was obtained, which was aged for 6 h at room temperature and dried at 343 K for 36 h in air to remove water and alcohol for getting a xerogel.Finally, TiO 2 nanoparticles were obtained by calcination of TiO 2 xerogel at the 873 K in air for 2 h with subsequent grinding. To characterize the crystal structure of the catalysts, powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded with a diffractometer (Shimadzu XRD 6000) using Cu K ( 0.15406 nm) radiation with a Nickel filter operating at 40 kV and 10 mA.The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface area of the samples were analyzed by nitrogen adsorption at 77 K on Micromeritics ASAP 2020 analyzer and calaulated by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method.Images of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) were obtained with a JEOL JEM-2100 electron microscope equipped with a field emission source at an accelerating voltage of 120 kV.Image of aberration-corrected high resolution transmission electron microscopy was got on a FEI Titan 80-300 equipped with a spherical aberration corrector for objective lens.The UV-vis diffused reflectance spectra (DRS) experiments were performed on a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Hitachi U-4100) using BaSO4 as the background.The surface chemical states and atomic concentration were characterized by Xray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and the measurements were performed on PerkinElmer PHI-1600 ESCA spectrometer using MgK (h 1253.6eV, 1 eV 1.603 10 -19 J) X-ray source.The XPS spectrum was calibrated with respect to the binding energy of the C 1s peak at 284.6 eV and was deconvoluted using related software.Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) was carried out at room temperature on an instrument JES FA-200 (JEOL) operating at the band frequency about 10.0 GHz with a field modulation frequency of 100 kHz.The modulation width was set at 0.1 mT and used microwave power was 1 mW.Visible Raman spectra were recorded at room temperature on a Renishaw Invia scanning double monochromator with the spectral resolution of 4 cm -1 .The line at 532 nm single-frequency laser was used as the excitation source.The 13 C isotopic tracer experiments were conducted and the obtained photocatalytic products were identified by a Thermo Fisher DSQ system.Such a GC-MS was equipped with a HP-5MS (30 m 0.25 mm 0.25 m) fused silica capillary column.The mass spectrometer was operated with an electron impact (EI) source at 70 eV ionization energy and scanned from 10 to 150 amu. CO 2 temperature-programmed desorption experiments were carried out using a Quantachrome Autosorb-IQ which consists of a flow switching system, a heated reactor, and a mass spectrometer.The samples (200 mg) were loaded in the reactor. Before the TPD analysis, the sample was purged under helium flow (50 mL min -1 ) from room temperature up to 873 K for 60 min at a heating rate of 10 K min -1 .The sample was subsequently cooled to 323 K under He flow, then the He flow was switched to CO 2 maintaining for 60 min.And then, the sample was swept with He for 100 min.The temperature was increased at 10 K min -1 from 323 to 1173 K.The 44, 35, 28, and 18 mass numbers were monitored during the TPD experiments. All the theoretical calculations were performed using the Vienna ab-initio simulation package (VASP) with the employment of a plane wave basis set 30.To analyze electron correlations in transition metal oxides, we conducted spin-polarized DFTU calculations with a value of U 4.0 eV applied to the Ti atom.The projector-augmented wave (PAW) method was used to represent the core-valence interaction 31.The plane wave energy cutoff was set to 400 eV.The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange-correlation functional was used in the calculations 32.Gaussian smearing method with the width of 0.05 eV was used.The Brillouin zone was sampled at the -point.The convergence criteria for the energy and force were set to 10 -5 eV and 0.02 eV/A, respectively. A slab model of anatase TiO 2 (1 0 1) surface was used in this study.The optimized lattice parameters of bulk anatase TiO 2 structure are a 3.78, b 3.78, and c 9.49.This TiO 2 model contains 72 atoms, with 48 O atoms and 24 Ti atoms.A vacuum gap of 12 A was employed in this study.During geometry optimization, all the atoms were allowed to relax.The La-modified TiO 2 was modeled by replacing one Ti atom with one La atom in the surface layer of anatase TiO 2 (1 0 1). The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reactions were carried out in LabSolar-H2 system, and the schematic of experimental system is shown in Fig. S1. 100 mg La-modified TiO 2 catalyst was welldistributed onto a groove of circular glass reactor with an inner basal area of 20 cm 2 .A 300 W Xe arc lamp was used as a light source without use of filter.Light passed through a thickness of 6 cm IR water filter, and then the filtered light was focused onto the reactor.All samples were tested under UV-vis irradiation for 12 h.Degussa P25 and pure anatase were selected as the reference catalysts in photoreduction of CO 2 .The reaction setup was vacuumed and full of high purity CO 2 gas several times, and finally the CO 2 and water vapor mixture was bubbled into the reaction setup until reaching ambient pressure, the mixture gas regulated by CO 2 was passed through the water of constant temperature 303 K bubbler to generate the mixture.During irradiation, the photoreduction of CO 2 was operated at closed gas-circulation system and the sampling of gas products for content analysis in the reactor was taken every 1 h by an on-line gas chromatograph (GC-9560 HuaAiSePu Corp., China).The GC-9560 was equipped with two automated gas sampling valves, a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and two flame ionization detector (FID).The quantification of the products was based on the external standard with the use of a calibration curve."}, {"llm generation": "Gas (water vapor)", "source": "Surface La-modified TiO 2 photocatalysts with different La amounts were prepared and tested for photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 in the presence of water vapor.", "context": "Surface La-modified TiO 2 photocatalysts with different La amounts were prepared and tested for photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 in the presence of water vapor.The results showed that the La 3 was mostly uniformly dispersed onto TiO 2 in the form of La 2 O 3 particles, and a handful of La atoms modify the surface of TiO 2 in the form of Ti O La.The introduction of La to the TiO 2 also promotes the formation of oxygen vacancies and Ti 3 onto the surface of TiO 2 .Consequently, La-modified TiO 2 samples demonstrate the enhanced CH 4 selectivity, with a 13 times of CH 4 yield of that on the P25 reference sample.The significantly enhanced CH 4 selectivity on surface La-modified TiO 2 samples is mainly attributed to the synergistic effects of the highly dispersion of La 2 O 3 and the formations of Ti 3 and oxygen vacancies on the adsorption of the CO 2 and H 2 O as well as the separation of photo-generated electrons and holes.Such a La 2 O 3 -loaded TiO 2 catalyst with La surface modification helps to provide new insights into the design and development of highly efficient photocatalysts for photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O vapor.
