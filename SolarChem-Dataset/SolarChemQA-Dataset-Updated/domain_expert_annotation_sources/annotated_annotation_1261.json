In Figure 2a, the element-bonding structure and element composition of the material are analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra.According to the test results, Ag, V, and O elements were confirmed to be loaded on CN.High-resolution XPS spectra for C 1s in Figure 2b have several obvious peaks.The peaks such as 284.6, 285.6, and 288.0 eV can correspond to C-C, C-N, and NC-N, respectively. 54The peaks of 404.0, 401.1, 399.8, and 398.5 eV in Figure 2c represent excitation, N-H, N-C 3 , and CN-C, respectively. 55In Figure 2d, peaks such as 367.1 and 373.1 eV may be due to the binding energy of Ag 3d 5/2 and Ag 3d 3/2 , respectively, which correspond to Ag , indicating that Ag 3 VO 4 is present in the composite.In Figure 2e, the peaks at 516.6 and 523.9 eV represent V 2p 3/2 and V 2p 1/2 of V 5 in Ag 3 VO 4 , respectively. 56The successful preparation of the CAR photocatalyst was confirmed by analysis results. 3.2.Fourier Transform Infrared and Raman Analysis.In Figure 3, the Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrum confirmed the changes of functional groups in the composites. The absorption peaks at 808, 1240, 1317, 1407, 1570, and 1635 cm -1 were generally characteristic breathing peaks of the tri-s triazine units and the skeletal oscillations of the C-N bond in the aromatic ring.There are broad absorption peaks around 3086 and 3412 cm -1 , which may be caused by the N-H group.The absorption peak among 850-1040 cm -1 of Ag 3 VO 4 corresponds to the tensile vibration of Ag-O-V, 57 and the same peak appeared in CA-35 and CAR-3.The Ag 3 VO 4 had been successfully loaded on CN and has been confirmed by the above evidence.Then, due to the loaded rGO, the peak intensity of CAR-3 was obviously weakened.Based on former analysis, further proved that the CAR photocatalysts were successfully prepared. The Raman spectrum was used to further characterize the molecular structure and crystal composition of the composite.The absorption peaks at 1159, 1231, 1491, and 1614 cm -1 are characteristic vibration peaks of CN in Figure 4a. 58Similar peaks appeared in the spectra of CA-35 and CAR-3, which matched the Raman spectra of CN.In Figure 4b, the main peak of Ag 3 VO 4 at 787 cm -1 and the weak shoulder at 823 cm -1 correspond to the symmetrical and antisymmetric tensile vibrations of the V-O group, respectively.The rGO has only two peaks at 1342 and 1591 cm -1 ; after the introduction of rGO, it can be seen that the peak intensity of CAR-3 has been reduced to some extent except two peaks of rGO compared with CA-35. Images and Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy Analysis.In Figure 5, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) were used to further study the structure and composition of the samples.In Figure 5a, it can be seen that CN has a loose and thin folded structure, which provides a large specific surface area. 59By observing the images in Figure 5b, it is clearly seen that the Ag 3 VO 4 particles were successfully grown and attached to the flake-shaped CN, showing the successful preparation of CA-35. 60The microstructure of CAR-3 in Figure 5c shows the successful load of rGO.After the introduction of rGO, the edge of Ag 3 VO 4 particles were observed to become darker and can be seen that rGO covers the interface of CA-35. Figure S1 displays different ratios of CAR photocatalysts.The elemental mapping results are consistent with XPS, confirming that the C, N, Ag, V, and O elements were uniformly dispersed in CAR-3.The CAR photocatalysts were successfully prepared and have a ternary sandwich structure, which was further confirmed by TEM and EDS analyses. 3.4.Brunauer-Emmett-Teller Analysis.The pore size distribution and specific surface area of the samples were analyzed by their N 2 adsorption-desorption characteristics.Figure 6 shows the adsorption-desorption isotherms of type IV hysteresis loops.The data in Figure 6a show that the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of CN is 51.603 m 2 /g, and the BET surface area of CA-35 is 27.855 m 2 /g, which were possible due to the dense distribution of Ag 3 VO 4 on CN.The BET surface area of CAR-3 is 44.343 m 2 /g, which points out that rGO combines well with CA-35 and provides more BET surface area than CA-35.The pore size in all samples are in the range of 2-4 nm, and the mesoporous structure is the target of most materials' preparation.The BET test proved that rGO provided CAR-3 with more adsorption surface area to adsorb CO 2 during the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction process.7a shows that CN and Ag 3 VO 4 have an intrinsic absorption edge at about 435 and 570 nm, respectively. 39Compared with CN, the absorption edge of the CA-35 composite photocatalyst shows a significant red shift, which points out that Ag 3 VO 4 has successfully widened the light absorption edge of composite materials.Moreover, the introduction of rGO has no significant effect on the absorption edge of the composite CAR-3.Also, the band gap of CN and Ag 3 VO 4 can be calculated by UV-vis DRS and the following equation (eq 1) wherein A, h, , , and E g are constants, Planck's constant, the frequency of light, the absorption coefficient, and the band gap energy, respectively.In literature reports, n values of CN and Ag 3 VO 4 are 1 and 4, 40,41 respectively.In Figure 7b, the E g values of CN and Ag 3 VO 4 are 2.72 and 2.27 eV, respectively.These results are calculated by equation (eq 1), which provide a basis for the subsequent study of the reaction mechanism.3.6.Electrochemical Properties and Photoluminescence Spectra.It is well known that the separation efficiency of electron-hole pairs plays a decisive role in photocatalytic reactions.In Figure 8a, the binary composite CA-35 shows a higher photocurrent response intensity than CN, which points out that it can enhance the separation of electron-hole pairs, 61 and CAR-3 has the highest photocurrent response intensity.In addition, according to the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in Figure 8b, the arc radius of CAR-3 is the lowest, further confirming that the introduction of rGO can accelerate the transmission of electrons. 62In Figure 8c, CN has the highest photoluminescence (PL) intensity and CAR-3 has Inorganic Chemistry a lower PL intensity, which can point out that the CAR-3 has the best electron-hole separation ability under light. 63The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) in Figure 8d shows that the CAR-3 photocatalyst has the lowest potential for exciting electrons, which indicates that the energy of CAR-3 required to excite electrons is less than CN and CA-35 required under UV-vis light irradiation. 64In general, the enhanced photoelectrochemical performance of the Z-scheme CAR-3 photocatalyst may be due to the multi-interface structure, providing multiple electron-transfer channels, which can effectively promote the excitation and transfer of electrons and can beneficially use photogenerated electrons for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.The cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves in Figure 8e are used to record the flow direction of electrons and holes in the sample.It can be observed that compared to CN and Ag 3 VO 4 , CA-35 has a higher reduction and oxidation, indicating that the oxidation and reducibility of CN after loaded Ag 3 VO 4 are enhanced.If the CAR-3 photocatalyst is a traditional heterojunction, then its redox capacity will decrease due to the downward flow of electrons and upward flow of holes.Therefore, the formation of the Z-scheme heterojunction is confirmed by the CV curve. 65.7.Photocatalytic CO 2 Reduction.The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction experiments were performed with H 2 O under UV-vis light irradiation, and triethanolamine (TEOA) was used to remove the photogenerated holes in the reaction system.According to our previous work, CN has a suitable conduction band (CB) position to support it to reduce CO 2 to CO (CO/CO 2 , -0.54 eV) and CH 4 (CH 4 /CO 2 , -0.24 eV). 12,28The Z-scheme 2D-0D-2D heterojunction provides multiple channels for the transmission of electrons (Ag 3 VO 4 CN and Ag 3 VO 4 rGO CN). 12 The potential electrontransfer method conforms to the Z-scheme, which can effectively retain the photogenerated electrons with strong reduction ability on CN.Simultaneously, the direct interaction between rGO and CN (- conjugation) can promote the excitation and transmission of electrons (rGO CN) 42,46 and further improve the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance of the composite material.Over the experiments, the CAR-3 photocatalyst has shown the best photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance, and the main products are CO and CH 4 .Figure 9a,b shows the yields of CO and CH 4 over time (0-4 h) and which increased with time.After 4 h of UV-vis light irradiation, the yields of CAR-3 for CO and CH 4 were and 28.1371 and 5.5961 mol/g, respectively.From the results of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, when the content of rGO is too much, the performance does not have the expected enhancement such as CAR-5 and CAR-10.It may be that an appropriate amount of rGO can form a close contact with CA-35 at the interface.But excess rGO will accumulate on CA-35, as shown in Figure S1, which will adversely affect the transmission of electrons.The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction experiments proved that the prepared Z-scheme CAR photocatalysts have excellent photocatalytic CO 2 reduction ability. 45n the general photocatalytic reduction process, H 2 O molecules in the system react with CO 2 to form H 2 CO 3 under the action of the photocatalyst. 42,66At the same time, a part of CO 2 is adsorbed on the surface of the photocatalyst (CO 2 ).Then, H 2 CO 3 was decomposed to produce HCO 3 and H , and the photocatalyst generates photogenerated electrons (e -) and holes (h ) under light.The sacrificial agent TEOA was used to adsorb h to reduce the recombination rate of electron-hole pairs.The specific processes are eqs 2-10 1,67 (2) The electron consumption rate of different photocatalysts during the photocatalytic reduction process is shown in Figure 9c, which was used to count the efficiency of photogenerated electrons in the photocatalytic reduction experiments.The calculation result comes from the equation (eq 11) 66 R r r (electron) 2 (CO) 8 (CH ) 4 (11) In the above equation, R(electron) represents the utilization rate of electrons, and 2r(CO) and 8r(CH 4 ) represent the generation rates of CO and CH 4 , respectively.Both Ag 3 VO 4 and rGO in the composite will accelerate the transmission of electrons.This result is consistent with the multi-interfacial electron-transfer path mechanism between the composites mentioned earlier.Therefore, the composite material CAR-3 can effectively accelerate the efficiency of electron separation and transmission, so that more photogenerated electrons can participate in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction process. 68In order to determine that the carbon source in the product comes from CO 2 , the filling gas in the reaction was replaced from CO 2 to N 2 under the same experimental conditions.As shown in Figure S2, after replacing CO 2 with N 2 , no CO and CH 4 appeared in the gas chromatographic detection results.Further, the 13 C-labelled CO 2 gas was used as the carbon source in the CO 2 reaction.In the Figure 9d, the gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) test proved that the peaks at m/z 17 and m/z 29 were ascribed to the 13 CH 4 and 13 CO, respectively.The photocatalyst's stability and recyclability are important factors affecting its practical application. 69To this end, cyclic photocatalytic CO 2 reduction experiments were performed to verify its stability.In Figure S3, four cycles of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction experiments were carried out by CAR-3.The XRD of CA-35 and CAR-3 after photocatalytic CO 2 reduction is shown in Figure S4.Because of the instability of Ag 3 VO 4 , the intensity of the characteristic peak was reduced.Moreover, the characteristic peak of CAR-3 did not change significantly.The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance of CAR-3 was only slightly decreased after 4 cycles, which proved that the introduction of rGO effectively solves the photocorrosion problem of Ag 3 VO 4 .The above results can show that the prepared CAR-3 photocatalyst has good stability.Furthermore, we tested the performance of CAR-3 using different wavelengths of light (using filters on a xenon lamp).The result in Figure S5 shows that CAR-3 has certain performance in the visible-light region ( 420 nm).Also, it has lower performance under the monochromatic light of 400, 550, and 650 nm (with a band pass filter).OH 2.34 V), which can be used as evidence for the formation of the Z-scheme mechanism.In the part of the reaction mechanism, the verification of the Z-scheme mechanism by ESR experiments will be discussed in detail. 3.9.Proposed Photocatalytic Mechanism.In previous studies, the performance improvement of g-C 3 N 4 /Ag 3 VO 4 was mainly attributed to the proper VB, the CB positions, and the separation and interface interaction. 35,36In Figure 11, Mott Schottky technology was used to analysis the CB position of the sample, and the flat band positions are -1.22 and -0.11 eV for CN and Ag 3 VO 4 , respectively.Since the actual CB position is about 0.2 eV more positive than the flat band potential, so the CB positions are -1.02 and 0.09 eV for CN and Ag 3 VO 4 , respectively.In the UV-vis DRS spectrum, the band gaps of CN and Ag 3 VO 4 are 2.72 and 2.27 eV, respectively.Their VB positions are 1.7 and 2.36 Ev, respectively, which are calculated by the band gap and CB positions. 36ased on the above analysis of the band structure of CN and Ag 3 VO 4 , it is speculated that the two possible heterojunction structures are the type-II heterojunction and Z-scheme heterojunction.Under UV-vis light irradiation, photogenerated electrons are generated on the VB of CN and Ag 3 VO 4 , which were excited to transfer to the CB and holes (h ) remain in the VB. 70As show in Figure 12a, if the potential transfer route of the e -and h follows the type-II heterojunction, the e -will be transferred to the CB of Ag 3 VO 4 and the h will be transferred to the VB of CN.In this case, the VB of the CB is not negative enough (E VB , 1. -in the results of the ESR experiments.Therefore, based on the above analysis, we can infer that the electron-hole transfer mode of the photocatalysts conforms to the Z-scheme mechanism. The possible photoreaction mechanism is shown in Figure 12b.Under UV-vis light irradiation, photogenerated electrons were excited from the VB to CB of CN and Ag 3 VO 4 and leave the h in the VB, the movement of the e -follows the Z-scheme mechanism from Ag 3 VO 4 to CN and recombine with h .Due to the excellent conductivity of rGO, other potential electrontransfer directions are Ag 3 VO 4 rGO CN and rGO CN (caused by the - conjugation effect between CN and rGO).Then, since the transfer of electrons follows the Z-scheme mechanism, the electrons from Ag 3 VO 4 recombine with the h of CN.Therefore, numerous photogenerated electrons on CN promoted by the - conjugation effect are retained and participated in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, which can reduce with CO 2 and H 2 O to CO and CH 4 , and TEOA was used to remove the h for reducing the electron-hole recombination."}, {"llm generation": "Ag 3 VO 4, CN", "source": "The analysis of the ESR experiment and the band gap inferred that the electron-transfer mechanism between Ag 3 VO 4 and CN conforms to the Z-scheme mechanism.", "context": "In summary, an enhanced Z-scheme CAR heterojunction photocatalyst was successfully prepared, which has shown better capacity in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.The obtained CAR-3 showed an enhanced CO yield of 7.03 mol/ h and CH 4 yield of 1.40 mol/h, which are 19.4 and 15.5 times that of CN, respectively.The analysis of the ESR experiment and the band gap inferred that the electron-transfer mechanism between Ag 3 VO 4 and CN conforms to the Z-scheme mechanism.Therefore, this can effectively retain the photogenerated electrons with strong reducing ability for CO 2 reduction.The rGO was introduced into the composite system not only as an electron-transfer medium but also to protect Ag 3 VO 4 .Furthermore, the - conjugation effect between rGO and g-C 3 N 4 effectively enhanced the electrontransfer efficiency.The prepared Z-scheme CAR photocatalysts have formed multi-interfacial electron-transfer paths: Ag 3 VO 4 CN, Ag 3 VO 4 rGO CN, and rGO CN, which greatly improved the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction efficiency.This work mainly pays attention to effects of the improvement of electron-transfer efficiency on the performance of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.

In Figure 2a, the element-bonding structure and element composition of the material are analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra.According to the test results, Ag, V, and O elements were confirmed to be loaded on CN.High-resolution XPS spectra for C 1s in Figure 2b have several obvious peaks.The peaks such as 284.6, 285.6, and 288.0 eV can correspond to C-C, C-N, and NC-N, respectively. 54The peaks of 404.0, 401.1, 399.8, and 398.5 eV in Figure 2c represent excitation, N-H, N-C 3 , and CN-C, respectively. 55In Figure 2d, peaks such as 367.1 and 373.1 eV may be due to the binding energy of Ag 3d 5/2 and Ag 3d 3/2 , respectively, which correspond to Ag , indicating that Ag 3 VO 4 is present in the composite.In Figure 2e, the peaks at 516.6 and 523.9 eV represent V 2p 3/2 and V 2p 1/2 of V 5 in Ag 3 VO 4 , respectively. 56The successful preparation of the CAR photocatalyst was confirmed by analysis results. 3.2.Fourier Transform Infrared and Raman Analysis.In Figure 3, the Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrum confirmed the changes of functional groups in the composites. The absorption peaks at 808, 1240, 1317, 1407, 1570, and 1635 cm -1 were generally characteristic breathing peaks of the tri-s triazine units and the skeletal oscillations of the C-N bond in the aromatic ring.There are broad absorption peaks around 3086 and 3412 cm -1 , which may be caused by the N-H group.The absorption peak among 850-1040 cm -1 of Ag 3 VO 4 corresponds to the tensile vibration of Ag-O-V, 57 and the same peak appeared in CA-35 and CAR-3.The Ag 3 VO 4 had been successfully loaded on CN and has been confirmed by the above evidence.Then, due to the loaded rGO, the peak intensity of CAR-3 was obviously weakened.Based on former analysis, further proved that the CAR photocatalysts were successfully prepared. The Raman spectrum was used to further characterize the molecular structure and crystal composition of the composite.The absorption peaks at 1159, 1231, 1491, and 1614 cm -1 are characteristic vibration peaks of CN in Figure 4a. 58Similar peaks appeared in the spectra of CA-35 and CAR-3, which matched the Raman spectra of CN.In Figure 4b, the main peak of Ag 3 VO 4 at 787 cm -1 and the weak shoulder at 823 cm -1 correspond to the symmetrical and antisymmetric tensile vibrations of the V-O group, respectively.The rGO has only two peaks at 1342 and 1591 cm -1 ; after the introduction of rGO, it can be seen that the peak intensity of CAR-3 has been reduced to some extent except two peaks of rGO compared with CA-35. Images and Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy Analysis.In Figure 5, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) were used to further study the structure and composition of the samples.In Figure 5a, it can be seen that CN has a loose and thin folded structure, which provides a large specific surface area. 59By observing the images in Figure 5b, it is clearly seen that the Ag 3 VO 4 particles were successfully grown and attached to the flake-shaped CN, showing the successful preparation of CA-35. 60The microstructure of CAR-3 in Figure 5c shows the successful load of rGO.After the introduction of rGO, the edge of Ag 3 VO 4 particles were observed to become darker and can be seen that rGO covers the interface of CA-35. Figure S1 displays different ratios of CAR photocatalysts.The elemental mapping results are consistent with XPS, confirming that the C, N, Ag, V, and O elements were uniformly dispersed in CAR-3.The CAR photocatalysts were successfully prepared and have a ternary sandwich structure, which was further confirmed by TEM and EDS analyses. 3.4.Brunauer-Emmett-Teller Analysis.The pore size distribution and specific surface area of the samples were analyzed by their N 2 adsorption-desorption characteristics.Figure 6 shows the adsorption-desorption isotherms of type IV hysteresis loops.The data in Figure 6a show that the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of CN is 51.603 m 2 /g, and the BET surface area of CA-35 is 27.855 m 2 /g, which were possible due to the dense distribution of Ag 3 VO 4 on CN.The BET surface area of CAR-3 is 44.343 m 2 /g, which points out that rGO combines well with CA-35 and provides more BET surface area than CA-35.The pore size in all samples are in the range of 2-4 nm, and the mesoporous structure is the target of most materials' preparation.The BET test proved that rGO provided CAR-3 with more adsorption surface area to adsorb CO 2 during the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction process.7a shows that CN and Ag 3 VO 4 have an intrinsic absorption edge at about 435 and 570 nm, respectively. 39Compared with CN, the absorption edge of the CA-35 composite photocatalyst shows a significant red shift, which points out that Ag 3 VO 4 has successfully widened the light absorption edge of composite materials.Moreover, the introduction of rGO has no significant effect on the absorption edge of the composite CAR-3.Also, the band gap of CN and Ag 3 VO 4 can be calculated by UV-vis DRS and the following equation (eq 1) wherein A, h, , , and E g are constants, Planck's constant, the frequency of light, the absorption coefficient, and the band gap energy, respectively.In literature reports, n values of CN and Ag 3 VO 4 are 1 and 4, 40,41 respectively.In Figure 7b, the E g values of CN and Ag 3 VO 4 are 2.72 and 2.27 eV, respectively.These results are calculated by equation (eq 1), which provide a basis for the subsequent study of the reaction mechanism.3.6.Electrochemical Properties and Photoluminescence Spectra.It is well known that the separation efficiency of electron-hole pairs plays a decisive role in photocatalytic reactions.In Figure 8a, the binary composite CA-35 shows a higher photocurrent response intensity than CN, which points out that it can enhance the separation of electron-hole pairs, 61 and CAR-3 has the highest photocurrent response intensity.In addition, according to the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in Figure 8b, the arc radius of CAR-3 is the lowest, further confirming that the introduction of rGO can accelerate the transmission of electrons. 62In Figure 8c, CN has the highest photoluminescence (PL) intensity and CAR-3 has Inorganic Chemistry a lower PL intensity, which can point out that the CAR-3 has the best electron-hole separation ability under light. 63The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) in Figure 8d shows that the CAR-3 photocatalyst has the lowest potential for exciting electrons, which indicates that the energy of CAR-3 required to excite electrons is less than CN and CA-35 required under UV-vis light irradiation. 64In general, the enhanced photoelectrochemical performance of the Z-scheme CAR-3 photocatalyst may be due to the multi-interface structure, providing multiple electron-transfer channels, which can effectively promote the excitation and transfer of electrons and can beneficially use photogenerated electrons for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.The cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves in Figure 8e are used to record the flow direction of electrons and holes in the sample.It can be observed that compared to CN and Ag 3 VO 4 , CA-35 has a higher reduction and oxidation, indicating that the oxidation and reducibility of CN after loaded Ag 3 VO 4 are enhanced.If the CAR-3 photocatalyst is a traditional heterojunction, then its redox capacity will decrease due to the downward flow of electrons and upward flow of holes.Therefore, the formation of the Z-scheme heterojunction is confirmed by the CV curve. 65.7.Photocatalytic CO 2 Reduction.The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction experiments were performed with H 2 O under UV-vis light irradiation, and triethanolamine (TEOA) was used to remove the photogenerated holes in the reaction system.According to our previous work, CN has a suitable conduction band (CB) position to support it to reduce CO 2 to CO (CO/CO 2 , -0.54 eV) and CH 4 (CH 4 /CO 2 , -0.24 eV). 12,28The Z-scheme 2D-0D-2D heterojunction provides multiple channels for the transmission of electrons (Ag 3 VO 4 CN and Ag 3 VO 4 rGO CN). 12 The potential electrontransfer method conforms to the Z-scheme, which can effectively retain the photogenerated electrons with strong reduction ability on CN.Simultaneously, the direct interaction between rGO and CN (- conjugation) can promote the excitation and transmission of electrons (rGO CN) 42,46 and further improve the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance of the composite material.Over the experiments, the CAR-3 photocatalyst has shown the best photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance, and the main products are CO and CH 4 .Figure 9a,b shows the yields of CO and CH 4 over time (0-4 h) and which increased with time.After 4 h of UV-vis light irradiation, the yields of CAR-3 for CO and CH 4 were and 28.1371 and 5.5961 mol/g, respectively.From the results of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, when the content of rGO is too much, the performance does not have the expected enhancement such as CAR-5 and CAR-10.It may be that an appropriate amount of rGO can form a close contact with CA-35 at the interface.But excess rGO will accumulate on CA-35, as shown in Figure S1, which will adversely affect the transmission of electrons.The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction experiments proved that the prepared Z-scheme CAR photocatalysts have excellent photocatalytic CO 2 reduction ability. 45n the general photocatalytic reduction process, H 2 O molecules in the system react with CO 2 to form H 2 CO 3 under the action of the photocatalyst. 42,66At the same time, a part of CO 2 is adsorbed on the surface of the photocatalyst (CO 2 ).Then, H 2 CO 3 was decomposed to produce HCO 3 and H , and the photocatalyst generates photogenerated electrons (e -) and holes (h ) under light.The sacrificial agent TEOA was used to adsorb h to reduce the recombination rate of electron-hole pairs.The specific processes are eqs 2-10 1,67 (2) The electron consumption rate of different photocatalysts during the photocatalytic reduction process is shown in Figure 9c, which was used to count the efficiency of photogenerated electrons in the photocatalytic reduction experiments.The calculation result comes from the equation (eq 11) 66 R r r (electron) 2 (CO) 8 (CH ) 4 (11) In the above equation, R(electron) represents the utilization rate of electrons, and 2r(CO) and 8r(CH 4 ) represent the generation rates of CO and CH 4 , respectively.Both Ag 3 VO 4 and rGO in the composite will accelerate the transmission of electrons.This result is consistent with the multi-interfacial electron-transfer path mechanism between the composites mentioned earlier.Therefore, the composite material CAR-3 can effectively accelerate the efficiency of electron separation and transmission, so that more photogenerated electrons can participate in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction process. 68In order to determine that the carbon source in the product comes from CO 2 , the filling gas in the reaction was replaced from CO 2 to N 2 under the same experimental conditions.As shown in Figure S2, after replacing CO 2 with N 2 , no CO and CH 4 appeared in the gas chromatographic detection results.Further, the 13 C-labelled CO 2 gas was used as the carbon source in the CO 2 reaction.In the Figure 9d, the gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) test proved that the peaks at m/z 17 and m/z 29 were ascribed to the 13 CH 4 and 13 CO, respectively.The photocatalyst's stability and recyclability are important factors affecting its practical application. 69To this end, cyclic photocatalytic CO 2 reduction experiments were performed to verify its stability.In Figure S3, four cycles of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction experiments were carried out by CAR-3.The XRD of CA-35 and CAR-3 after photocatalytic CO 2 reduction is shown in Figure S4.Because of the instability of Ag 3 VO 4 , the intensity of the characteristic peak was reduced.Moreover, the characteristic peak of CAR-3 did not change significantly.The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance of CAR-3 was only slightly decreased after 4 cycles, which proved that the introduction of rGO effectively solves the photocorrosion problem of Ag 3 VO 4 .The above results can show that the prepared CAR-3 photocatalyst has good stability.Furthermore, we tested the performance of CAR-3 using different wavelengths of light (using filters on a xenon lamp).The result in Figure S5 shows that CAR-3 has certain performance in the visible-light region ( 420 nm).Also, it has lower performance under the monochromatic light of 400, 550, and 650 nm (with a band pass filter).OH 2.34 V), which can be used as evidence for the formation of the Z-scheme mechanism.In the part of the reaction mechanism, the verification of the Z-scheme mechanism by ESR experiments will be discussed in detail. 3.9.Proposed Photocatalytic Mechanism.In previous studies, the performance improvement of g-C 3 N 4 /Ag 3 VO 4 was mainly attributed to the proper VB, the CB positions, and the separation and interface interaction. 35,36In Figure 11, Mott Schottky technology was used to analysis the CB position of the sample, and the flat band positions are -1.22 and -0.11 eV for CN and Ag 3 VO 4 , respectively.Since the actual CB position is about 0.2 eV more positive than the flat band potential, so the CB positions are -1.02 and 0.09 eV for CN and Ag 3 VO 4 , respectively.In the UV-vis DRS spectrum, the band gaps of CN and Ag 3 VO 4 are 2.72 and 2.27 eV, respectively.Their VB positions are 1.7 and 2.36 Ev, respectively, which are calculated by the band gap and CB positions. 36ased on the above analysis of the band structure of CN and Ag 3 VO 4 , it is speculated that the two possible heterojunction structures are the type-II heterojunction and Z-scheme heterojunction.Under UV-vis light irradiation, photogenerated electrons are generated on the VB of CN and Ag 3 VO 4 , which were excited to transfer to the CB and holes (h ) remain in the VB. 70As show in Figure 12a, if the potential transfer route of the e -and h follows the type-II heterojunction, the e -will be transferred to the CB of Ag 3 VO 4 and the h will be transferred to the VB of CN.In this case, the VB of the CB is not negative enough (E VB , 1. -in the results of the ESR experiments.Therefore, based on the above analysis, we can infer that the electron-hole transfer mode of the photocatalysts conforms to the Z-scheme mechanism. The possible photoreaction mechanism is shown in Figure 12b.Under UV-vis light irradiation, photogenerated electrons were excited from the VB to CB of CN and Ag 3 VO 4 and leave the h in the VB, the movement of the e -follows the Z-scheme mechanism from Ag 3 VO 4 to CN and recombine with h .Due to the excellent conductivity of rGO, other potential electrontransfer directions are Ag 3 VO 4 rGO CN and rGO CN (caused by the - conjugation effect between CN and rGO).Then, since the transfer of electrons follows the Z-scheme mechanism, the electrons from Ag 3 VO 4 recombine with the h of CN.Therefore, numerous photogenerated electrons on CN promoted by the - conjugation effect are retained and participated in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, which can reduce with CO 2 and H 2 O to CO and CH 4 , and TEOA was used to remove the h for reducing the electron-hole recombination."}, {"llm generation": "Monochromatic", "source": "Also, it has lower performance under the monochromatic light of 400, 550, and 650 nm (with a band pass filter).", "context": "3.1.X-ray Diffraction and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy Analysis.In Figure 1, the phase structure and chemical composition of the prepared samples were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD).The CN peaks near 13.8 and 27.7i n Figure 1a are characteristic in-plane stacking peaks corresponding to (100) and (002) crystal planes of g-C 3 N 4 , respectively.Main diffraction peaks of CA-35 at about 19.1, 30.9, 32.3, 35.1, 35.9, 38.9, 51.4, and 54.1, respectively, correspond to the (011), (-121), ( 121), ( 301), ( 202), ( 022), (-330), and (331) crystal plane of Ag 3 VO 4 (PDF 43-0542) and exhibit higher crystallization. 53Moreover, the absorption peaks of CAR in different proportions are similar to the absorption peaks of Ag 3 VO 4 . 40After the addition of rGO, the intensity of the characteristic peaks decreased significantly, which indicates that rGO successfully covered Ag 3 VO 4 on the surface of the CA-35.As shown in Figure 1b, the peak intensity of the ternary complex decreases slightly with the increase in rGO.The results showed that the prepared photocatalyst contained three phases: g-C 3 N 4 , Ag 3 VO 4 , and rGO, which means that the CAR photocatalyst was successfully prepared.

The absorption peaks at 808, 1240, 1317, 1407, 1570, and 1635 cm -1 were generally characteristic breathing peaks of the tri-s triazine units and the skeletal oscillations of the C-N bond in the aromatic ring.There are broad absorption peaks around 3086 and 3412 cm -1 , which may be caused by the N-H group.The absorption peak among 850-1040 cm -1 of Ag 3 VO 4 corresponds to the tensile vibration of Ag-O-V, 57 and the same peak appeared in CA-35 and CAR-3.The Ag 3 VO 4 had been successfully loaded on CN and has been confirmed by the above evidence.Then, due to the loaded rGO, the peak intensity of CAR-3 was obviously weakened.Based on former analysis, further proved that the CAR photocatalysts were successfully prepared.

that an appropriate amount of rGO can form a close contact with CA-35 at the interface.But excess rGO will accumulate on CA-35, as shown in Figure S1, which will adversely affect the transmission of electrons.The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction experiments proved that the prepared Z-scheme CAR photocatalysts have excellent photocatalytic CO 2 reduction ability. 45n the general photocatalytic reduction process, H 2 O molecules in the system react with CO 2 to form H 2 CO 3 under the action of the photocatalyst. 42,66At the same time, a part of CO 2 is adsorbed on the surface of the photocatalyst (CO 2 ).Then, H 2 CO 3 was decomposed to produce HCO 3 and H , and the photocatalyst generates photogenerated electrons (e -) and holes (h ) under light.The sacrificial agent TEOA was used to adsorb h to reduce the recombination rate of electron-hole pairs.The specific processes are eqs 2-10 1,67 (2) The electron consumption rate of different photocatalysts during the photocatalytic reduction process is shown in Figure 9c, which was used to count the efficiency of photogenerated electrons in the photocatalytic reduction experiments.The calculation result comes from the equation (eq 11) 66 R r r (electron) 2 (CO) 8 (CH ) 4 (11) In the above equation, R(electron) represents the utilization rate of electrons, and 2r(CO) and 8r(CH 4 ) represent the generation rates of CO and CH 4 , respectively.Both Ag 3 VO 4 and rGO in the composite will accelerate the transmission of electrons.This result is consistent with the multi-interfacial electron-transfer path mechanism between the composites mentioned earlier.Therefore, the composite material CAR-3 can effectively accelerate the efficiency of electron separation and transmission, so that more photogenerated electrons can participate in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction process. 68In order to determine that the carbon source in the product comes from CO 2 , the filling gas in the reaction was replaced from CO 2 to N 2 under the same experimental conditions.As shown in Figure S2, after replacing CO 2 with N 2 , no CO and CH 4 appeared in the gas chromatographic detection results.Further, the 13 C-labelled CO 2 gas was used as the carbon source in the CO 2 reaction.In the Figure 9d, the gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) test proved that the peaks at m/z 17 and m/z 29 were ascribed to the 13 CH 4 and 13 CO, respectively.The photocatalyst's stability and recyclability are important factors affecting its practical application. 69To this end, cyclic photocatalytic CO 2 reduction experiments were performed to verify its stability.In Figure S3, four cycles of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction experiments were carried out by CAR-3.The XRD of CA-35 and CAR-3 after photocatalytic CO 2 reduction is shown in Figure S4.Because of the instability of Ag 3 VO 4 , the intensity of the characteristic peak was reduced.Moreover, the characteristic peak of CAR-3 did not change significantly.The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance of CAR-3 was only slightly decreased after 4 cycles, which proved that the introduction of rGO effectively solves the photocorrosion problem of Ag 3 VO 4 .The above results can show that the prepared CAR-3 photocatalyst has good stability.Furthermore, we tested the performance of CAR-3 using different wavelengths of light (using filters on a xenon lamp).The result in Figure S5 shows that CAR-3 has certain performance in the visible-light region ( 420 nm).Also, it has lower performance under the monochromatic light of 400, 550, and 650 nm (with a band pass filter).OH 2.34 V), which can be used as evidence for the formation of the Z-scheme mechanism.In the part of the reaction mechanism, the verification of the Z-scheme mechanism by ESR experiments will be discussed in detail. 3.9.Proposed Photocatalytic Mechanism.In previous studies, the performance improvement of g-C 3 N 4 /Ag 3 VO 4 was mainly attributed to the proper VB, the CB positions, and the separation and interface interaction. 35,36In Figure 11, Mott Schottky technology was used to analysis the CB position of the sample, and the flat band positions are -1.22 and -0.11 eV for CN and Ag 3 VO 4 , respectively.Since the actual CB position is about 0.2 eV more positive than the flat band potential, so the CB positions are -1.02 and 0.09 eV for CN and Ag 3 VO 4 , respectively.In the UV-vis DRS spectrum, the band gaps of CN and Ag 3 VO 4 are 2.72 and 2.27 eV, respectively.Their VB positions are 1.7 and 2.36 Ev, respectively, which are calculated by the band gap and CB positions. 36ased on the above analysis of the band structure of CN and Ag 3 VO 4 , it is speculated that the two possible heterojunction structures are the type-II heterojunction and Z-scheme heterojunction.Under UV-vis light irradiation, photogenerated electrons are generated on the VB of CN and Ag 3 VO 4 , which were excited to transfer to the CB and holes (h ) remain in the VB. 70As show in Figure 12a, if the potential transfer route of the e -and h follows the type-II heterojunction, the e -will be transferred to the CB of Ag 3 VO 4 and the h will be transferred to the VB of CN.In this case, the VB of the CB is not negative enough (E VB , 1. -in the results of the ESR experiments.Therefore, based on the above analysis, we can infer that the electron-hole transfer mode of the photocatalysts conforms to the Z-scheme mechanism. The possible photoreaction mechanism is shown in Figure 12b.Under UV-vis light irradiation, photogenerated electrons were excited from the VB to CB of CN and Ag 3 VO 4 and leave the h in the VB, the movement of the e -follows the Z-scheme mechanism from Ag 3 VO 4 to CN and recombine with h .Due to the excellent conductivity of rGO, other potential electrontransfer directions are Ag 3 VO 4 rGO CN and rGO CN (caused by the - conjugation effect between CN and rGO).Then, since the transfer of electrons follows the Z-scheme mechanism, the electrons from Ag 3 VO 4 recombine with the h of CN.Therefore, numerous photogenerated electrons on CN promoted by the - conjugation effect are retained and participated in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, which can reduce with CO 2 and H 2 O to CO and CH 4 , and TEOA was used to remove the h for reducing the electron-hole recombination."}, {"llm generation": "UV-visible", "source": "The UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectrum (UV-vis DRS) was used to analyze the band gap and light absorption capacity of CN, Ag 3 VO 4 , CA-35, and CAR-3.", "context": "In summary, an enhanced Z-scheme CAR heterojunction photocatalyst was successfully prepared, which has shown better capacity in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.The obtained CAR-3 showed an enhanced CO yield of 7.03 mol/ h and CH 4 yield of 1.40 mol/h, which are 19.4 and 15.5 times that of CN, respectively.The analysis of the ESR experiment and the band gap inferred that the electron-transfer mechanism between Ag 3 VO 4 and CN conforms to the Z-scheme mechanism.Therefore, this can effectively retain the photogenerated electrons with strong reducing ability for CO 2 reduction.The rGO was introduced into the composite system not only as an electron-transfer medium but also to protect Ag 3 VO 4 .Furthermore, the - conjugation effect between rGO and g-C 3 N 4 effectively enhanced the electrontransfer efficiency.The prepared Z-scheme CAR photocatalysts have formed multi-interfacial electron-transfer paths: Ag 3 VO 4 CN, Ag 3 VO 4 rGO CN, and rGO CN, which greatly improved the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction efficiency.This work mainly pays attention to effects of the improvement of electron-transfer efficiency on the performance of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.

Based on our previous work, 36 we have found the best-performing g-C 3 N 4 /Ag 3 VO 4 with a ratio of 35 (the ratio of Ag 3 VO 4 to CN) and named as CA-35.Then, a bit rGO was introduced by stirring to obtain CAR photocatalysts.Different masses of rGO were added to beakers containing 40 mL of deionized water and ultrasound for 30 min.Then, 100 mg of CA-35 deionized water was added and stirred for 2 h.Due to the strong - conjugation between CN and rGO, the materials can self-assemble into a 2D-2D structure. 51The obtained samples were repeatedly washed by centrifugation and dried at 60 C for 24 h and named CAR-x (x was the ratio of rGO to CA-35). 52The specific prepared processes are displayed in Scheme 1."}, {"llm generation": "Liquid (H2O)", "source": "The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction experiments were performed with H 2 O under UV-vis light irradiation, and triethanolamine (TEOA) was used to remove the photogenerated holes in the reaction system.", "context": "3.1.X-ray Diffraction and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy Analysis.In Figure 1, the phase structure and chemical composition of the prepared samples were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD).The CN peaks near 13.8 and 27.7i n Figure 1a are characteristic in-plane stacking peaks corresponding to (100) and (002) crystal planes of g-C 3 N 4 , respectively.Main diffraction peaks of CA-35 at about 19.1, 30.9, 32.3, 35.1, 35.9, 38.9, 51.4, and 54.1, respectively, correspond to the (011), (-121), ( 121), ( 301), ( 202), ( 022), (-330), and (331) crystal plane of Ag 3 VO 4 (PDF 43-0542) and exhibit higher crystallization. 53Moreover, the absorption peaks of CAR in different proportions are similar to the absorption peaks of Ag 3 VO 4 . 40After the addition of rGO, the intensity of the characteristic peaks decreased significantly, which indicates that rGO successfully covered Ag 3 VO 4 on the surface of the CA-35.As shown in Figure 1b, the peak intensity of the ternary complex decreases slightly with the increase in rGO.The results showed that the prepared photocatalyst contained three phases: g-C 3 N 4 , Ag 3 VO 4 , and rGO, which means that the CAR photocatalyst was successfully prepared. In Figure 2a, the element-bonding structure and element composition of the material are analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra.According to the test results, Ag, V, and O elements were confirmed to be loaded on CN.High-resolution XPS spectra for C 1s in Figure 2b have several obvious peaks.The peaks such as 284.6, 285.6, and 288.0 eV can correspond to C-C, C-N, and NC-N, respectively. 54The peaks of 404.0, 401.1, 399.8, and 398.5 eV in Figure 2c represent excitation, N-H, N-C 3 , and CN-C, respectively. 55In Figure 2d, peaks such as 367.1 and 373.1 eV may be due to the binding energy of Ag 3d 5/2 and Ag 3d 3/2 , respectively, which correspond to Ag , indicating that Ag 3 VO 4 is present in the composite.In Figure 2e, the peaks at 516.6 and 523.9 eV represent V 2p 3/2 and V 2p 1/2 of V 5 in Ag 3 VO 4 , respectively. 56The successful preparation of the CAR photocatalyst was confirmed by analysis results. 3.2.Fourier Transform Infrared and Raman Analysis.In Figure 3, the Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrum confirmed the changes of functional groups in the composites. The absorption peaks at 808, 1240, 1317, 1407, 1570, and 1635 cm -1 were generally characteristic breathing peaks of the tri-s triazine units and the skeletal oscillations of the C-N bond in the aromatic ring.There are broad absorption peaks around 3086 and 3412 cm -1 , which may be caused by the N-H group.The absorption peak among 850-1040 cm -1 of Ag 3 VO 4 corresponds to the tensile vibration of Ag-O-V, 57 and the same peak appeared in CA-35 and CAR-3.The Ag 3 VO 4 had been successfully loaded on CN and has been confirmed by the above evidence.Then, due to the loaded rGO, the peak intensity of CAR-3 was obviously weakened.Based on former analysis, further proved that the CAR photocatalysts were successfully prepared. The Raman spectrum was used to further characterize the molecular structure and crystal composition of the composite.The absorption peaks at 1159, 1231, 1491, and 1614 cm -1 are characteristic vibration peaks of CN in Figure 4a. 58Similar peaks appeared in the spectra of CA-35 and CAR-3, which matched the Raman spectra of CN.In Figure 4b, the main peak of Ag 3 VO 4 at 787 cm -1 and the weak shoulder at 823 cm -1 correspond to the symmetrical and antisymmetric tensile vibrations of the V-O group, respectively.The rGO has only two peaks at 1342 and 1591 cm -1 ; after the introduction of rGO, it can be seen that the peak intensity of CAR-3 has been reduced to some extent except two peaks of rGO compared with CA-35. Images and Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy Analysis.In Figure 5, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) were used to further study the structure and composition of the samples.In Figure 5a, it can be seen that CN has a loose and thin folded structure, which provides a large specific surface area. 59By observing the images in Figure 5b, it is clearly seen that the Ag 3 VO 4 particles were successfully grown and attached to the flake-shaped CN, showing the successful preparation of CA-35. 60The microstructure of CAR-3 in Figure 5c shows the successful load of rGO.After the introduction of rGO, the edge of Ag 3 VO 4 particles were observed to become darker and can be seen that rGO covers the interface of CA-35. Figure S1 displays different ratios of CAR photocatalysts.The elemental mapping results are consistent with XPS, confirming that the C, N, Ag, V, and O elements were uniformly dispersed in CAR-3.The CAR photocatalysts were successfully prepared and have a ternary sandwich structure, which was further confirmed by TEM and EDS analyses. 3.4.Brunauer-Emmett-Teller Analysis.The pore size distribution and specific surface area of the samples were analyzed by their N 2 adsorption-desorption characteristics.Figure 6 shows the adsorption-desorption isotherms of type IV hysteresis loops.The data in Figure 6a show that the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of CN is 51.603 m 2 /g, and the BET surface area of CA-35 is 27.855 m 2 /g, which were possible due to the dense distribution of Ag 3 VO 4 on CN.The BET surface area of CAR-3 is 44.343 m 2 /g, which points out that rGO combines well with CA-35 and provides more BET surface area than CA-35.The pore size in all samples are in the range of 2-4 nm, and the mesoporous structure is the target of most materials' preparation.The BET test proved that rGO provided CAR-3 with more adsorption surface area to adsorb CO 2 during the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction process.7a shows that CN and Ag 3 VO 4 have an intrinsic absorption edge at about 435 and 570 nm, respectively. 39Compared with CN, the absorption edge of the CA-35 composite photocatalyst shows a significant red shift, which points out that Ag 3 VO 4 has successfully widened the light absorption edge of composite materials.Moreover, the introduction of rGO has no significant effect on the absorption edge of the composite CAR-3.Also, the band gap of CN and Ag 3 VO 4 can be calculated by UV-vis DRS and the following equation (eq 1) wherein A, h, , , and E g are constants, Planck's constant, the frequency of light, the absorption coefficient, and the band gap energy, respectively.In literature reports, n values of CN and Ag 3 VO 4 are 1 and 4, 40,41 respectively.In Figure 7b, the E g values of CN and Ag 3 VO 4 are 2.72 and 2.27 eV, respectively.These results are calculated by equation (eq 1), which provide a basis for the subsequent study of the reaction mechanism.3.6.Electrochemical Properties and Photoluminescence Spectra.It is well known that the separation efficiency of electron-hole pairs plays a decisive role in photocatalytic reactions.In Figure 8a, the binary composite CA-35 shows a higher photocurrent response intensity than CN, which points out that it can enhance the separation of electron-hole pairs, 61 and CAR-3 has the highest photocurrent response intensity.In addition, according to the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in Figure 8b, the arc radius of CAR-3 is the lowest, further confirming that the introduction of rGO can accelerate the transmission of electrons. 62In Figure 8c, CN has the highest photoluminescence (PL) intensity and CAR-3 has Inorganic Chemistry a lower PL intensity, which can point out that the CAR-3 has the best electron-hole separation ability under light. 63The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) in Figure 8d shows that the CAR-3 photocatalyst has the lowest potential for exciting electrons, which indicates that the energy of CAR-3 required to excite electrons is less than CN and CA-35 required under UV-vis light irradiation. 64In general, the enhanced photoelectrochemical performance of the Z-scheme CAR-3 photocatalyst may be due to the multi-interface structure, providing multiple electron-transfer channels, which can effectively promote the excitation and transfer of electrons and can beneficially use photogenerated electrons for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.The cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves in Figure 8e are used to record the flow direction of electrons and holes in the sample.It can be observed that compared to CN and Ag 3 VO 4 , CA-35 has a higher reduction and oxidation, indicating that the oxidation and reducibility of CN after loaded Ag 3 VO 4 are enhanced.If the CAR-3 photocatalyst is a traditional heterojunction, then its redox capacity will decrease due to the downward flow of electrons and upward flow of holes.Therefore, the formation of the Z-scheme heterojunction is confirmed by the CV curve. 65.7.Photocatalytic CO 2 Reduction.The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction experiments were performed with H 2 O under UV-vis light irradiation, and triethanolamine (TEOA) was used to remove the photogenerated holes in the reaction system.According to our previous work, CN has a suitable conduction band (CB) position to support it to reduce CO 2 to CO (CO/CO 2 , -0.54 eV) and CH 4 (CH 4 /CO 2 , -0.24 eV). 12,28The Z-scheme 2D-0D-2D heterojunction provides multiple channels for the transmission of electrons (Ag 3 VO 4 CN and Ag 3 VO 4 rGO CN). 12 The potential electrontransfer method conforms to the Z-scheme, which can effectively retain the photogenerated electrons with strong reduction ability on CN.Simultaneously, the direct interaction between rGO and CN (- conjugation) can promote the excitation and transmission of electrons (rGO CN) 42,46 and further improve the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance of the composite material.Over the experiments, the CAR-3 photocatalyst has shown the best photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance, and the main products are CO and CH 4 .Figure 9a,b shows the yields of CO and CH 4 over time (0-4 h) and which increased with time.After 4 h of UV-vis light irradiation, the yields of CAR-3 for CO and CH 4 were and 28.1371 and 5.5961 mol/g, respectively.From the results of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, when the content of rGO is too much, the performance does not have the expected enhancement such as CAR-5 and CAR-10.It may be that an appropriate amount of rGO can form a close contact with CA-35 at the interface.But excess rGO will accumulate on CA-35, as shown in Figure S1, which will adversely affect the transmission of electrons.The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction experiments proved that the prepared Z-scheme CAR photocatalysts have excellent photocatalytic CO 2 reduction ability. 45n the general photocatalytic reduction process, H 2 O molecules in the system react with CO 2 to form H 2 CO 3 under the action of the photocatalyst. 42,66At the same time, a part of CO 2 is adsorbed on the surface of the photocatalyst (CO 2 ).Then, H 2 CO 3 was decomposed to produce HCO 3 and H , and the photocatalyst generates photogenerated electrons (e -) and holes (h ) under light.The sacrificial agent TEOA was used to adsorb h to reduce the recombination rate of electron-hole pairs.The specific processes are eqs 2-10 1,67 (2) The electron consumption rate of different photocatalysts during the photocatalytic reduction process is shown in Figure 9c, which was used to count the efficiency of photogenerated electrons in the photocatalytic reduction experiments.The calculation result comes from the equation (eq 11) 66 R r r (electron) 2 (CO) 8 (CH ) 4 (11) In the above equation, R(electron) represents the utilization rate of electrons, and 2r(CO) and 8r(CH 4 ) represent the generation rates of CO and CH 4 , respectively.Both Ag 3 VO 4 and rGO in the composite will accelerate the transmission of electrons.This result is consistent with the multi-interfacial electron-transfer path mechanism between the composites mentioned earlier.Therefore, the composite material CAR-3 can effectively accelerate the efficiency of electron separation and transmission, so that more photogenerated electrons can participate in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction process. 68In order to determine that the carbon source in the product comes from CO 2 , the filling gas in the reaction was replaced from CO 2 to N 2 under the same experimental conditions.As shown in Figure S2, after replacing CO 2 with N 2 , no CO and CH 4 appeared in the gas chromatographic detection results.Further, the 13 C-labelled CO 2 gas was used as the carbon source in the CO 2 reaction.In the Figure 9d, the gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) test proved that the peaks at m/z 17 and m/z 29 were ascribed to the 13 CH 4 and 13 CO, respectively.The photocatalyst's stability and recyclability are important factors affecting its practical application. 69To this end, cyclic photocatalytic CO 2 reduction experiments were performed to verify its stability.In Figure S3, four cycles of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction experiments were carried out by CAR-3.The XRD of CA-35 and CAR-3 after photocatalytic CO 2 reduction is shown in Figure S4.Because of the instability of Ag 3 VO 4 , the intensity of the characteristic peak was reduced.Moreover, the characteristic peak of CAR-3 did not change significantly.The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance of CAR-3 was only slightly decreased after 4 cycles, which proved that the introduction of rGO effectively solves the photocorrosion problem of Ag 3 VO 4 .The above results can show that the prepared CAR-3 photocatalyst has good stability.Furthermore, we tested the performance of CAR-3 using different wavelengths of light (using filters on a xenon lamp).The result in Figure S5 shows that CAR-3 has certain performance in the visible-light region ( 420 nm).Also, it has lower performance under the monochromatic light of 400, 550, and 650 nm (with a band pass filter).OH 2.34 V), which can be used as evidence for the formation of the Z-scheme mechanism.In the part of the reaction mechanism, the verification of the Z-scheme mechanism by ESR experiments will be discussed in detail. 3.9.Proposed Photocatalytic Mechanism.In previous studies, the performance improvement of g-C 3 N 4 /Ag 3 VO 4 was mainly attributed to the proper VB, the CB positions, and the separation and interface interaction. 35,36In Figure 11, Mott Schottky technology was used to analysis the CB position of the sample, and the flat band positions are -1.22 and -0.11 eV for CN and Ag 3 VO 4 , respectively.Since the actual CB position is about 0.2 eV more positive than the flat band potential, so the CB positions are -1.02 and 0.09 eV for CN and Ag 3 VO 4 , respectively.In the UV-vis DRS spectrum, the band gaps of CN and Ag 3 VO 4 are 2.72 and 2.27 eV, respectively.Their VB positions are 1.7 and 2.36 Ev, respectively, which are calculated by the band gap and CB positions. 36ased on the above analysis of the band structure of CN and Ag 3 VO 4 , it is speculated that the two possible heterojunction structures are the type-II heterojunction and Z-scheme heterojunction.Under UV-vis light irradiation, photogenerated electrons are generated on the VB of CN and Ag 3 VO 4 , which were excited to transfer to the CB and holes (h ) remain in the VB. 70As show in Figure 12a, if the potential transfer route of the e -and h follows the type-II heterojunction, the e -will be transferred to the CB of Ag 3 VO 4 and the h will be transferred to the VB of CN.In this case, the VB of the CB is not negative enough (E VB , 1. -in the results of the ESR experiments.Therefore, based on the above analysis, we can infer that the electron-hole transfer mode of the photocatalysts conforms to the Z-scheme mechanism. The possible photoreaction mechanism is shown in Figure 12b.Under UV-vis light irradiation, photogenerated electrons were excited from the VB to CB of CN and Ag 3 VO 4 and leave the h in the VB, the movement of the e -follows the Z-scheme mechanism from Ag 3 VO 4 to CN and recombine with h .Due to the excellent conductivity of rGO, other potential electrontransfer directions are Ag 3 VO 4 rGO CN and rGO CN (caused by the - conjugation effect between CN and rGO).Then, since the transfer of electrons follows the Z-scheme mechanism, the electrons from Ag 3 VO 4 recombine with the h of CN.Therefore, numerous photogenerated electrons on CN promoted by the - conjugation effect are retained and participated in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, which can reduce with CO 2 and H 2 O to CO and CH 4 , and TEOA was used to remove the h for reducing the electron-hole recombination."}], "reactor type": [], "operation mode": []}}
