Photocatalytic reactions were carried out in a specially designed reactor of gas-liquid-solid three phases (Fig. 1) under a flow of CO 2 (Taiyo Nippon Sanso, 99.999) gas upon photoirradiation from the bottom (16 cm 2 ) by a 300 W xenon lamp without passing any optical filters, which entirely emitted from UV to visible light, under ambient temperature and pressure.In a quartz cell, 0.2 g of the photocatalyst powder was dispersed in 10 mL of water saturated with 11 mmol of NaHCO 3 (Wako, 99.5).The pH of the solution was 8.3.The mixture of the solution and the photocatalyst powder was photoirradiated with magnetically stirring, where the reaction occurred.The incident light intensity measured in the range of 254 10 nm at the center of the cell was 22 mW cm -2 , and the temperature of the reaction cell became 323 K during the photoirradiation.At regular interval (typically every 1 h), the outlet gas was collected in a sampling column and introduced to an online gas chromatograph with a thermal conductivity detector to determine the amount of H 2 , O 2 and CO.The production rate of H 2 and CO was precisely determined in this method.The amount of O 2 was determined by the subtraction of the amount of air leak into the system, which sometimes contained large error unfortunately.Other products were not observed in this method.Selectivity for CO in the reduced products, S CO was defined as follows: S CO () 100 (production rate of CO)/(sum of production rates of CO and H 2 ).The ratio of the electrons and holes consumed, e -/h was calculated from the production rate as follows: e -/h (sum of production rates of CO and H 2 )/(production rate of O 2 2)."}, {"llm generation": "Ag", "source": "Without Ag cocatalyst, or without the photoirradiation, the reaction did not proceed.", "context": "Fig. 2 shows XRD patterns of representative CaTiO 3 samples and a calculated one from a database (ICSD 74212).All the CTO samples exhibited clear diffraction lines assignable to CaTiO 3 crystal and no other diffraction lines from impurity was observed in these profiles, indicating that these prepared CTO samples predominantly consisted of the CaTiO 3 crystallites.It is noted that any kind of flux such as CaCl 2 , KCl and NaCl provided CaTiO 3 crystallites.Even when excess amount of molten CaCl 2 was used as a flux, no other calcium-rich compounds such as Ca 3 Ti 2 O 7 and Ca 4 Ti 3 O 10 33 were formed.This result revealed that the composition of calcium titanate would be determined by not the solute concentration (x mol) in the molten salt mixture and the kind of the flux but the atomic ratio of the starting materials, i.e., CaCO 3 and TiO 2 .In the present case, the atomic ratio of Ca and Ti was unity, which thus provided CaTiO 3 crystallites.In other words, the CaTiO 3 crystallites would originate from TiO 2 and CaCO 3 .It is considered that CaO clusters dissolved in the molten salt, which could be formed from CaCO 3 by thermal decomposition, would predominantly react with dissolved TiO 2 clusters to form the CaTiO 3 crystallites, while Ca 2 cation of the CaCl 2 flux could not react with TiO 2 species in the present condition, as previously discussed 25.It is also noted that, even the crystallization of CaTiO 3 took place in other molten salts, such as KCl and NaCl, no compounds containing K and Na would be formed.Thus, it is clear that these alkali chloride fluxes such as CaCl 2 , KCl and NaCl could not react with TiO 2 and could not exchange with the Ca cation in the crystallites of CaTiO 3 in this condition.The average crystallites size of the samples were estimated from XRD profiles (Table 1), which clarified that the CTO(CaCl 2 ,5) sample obviously had larger crystallites than others. The FE-SEM images revealed that the use of CaCl 2 , KCl and NaCl as a flux gave various morphologies.In some cases, various facets could be found on their surfaces.The CaCl 2 flux gave clear and large cubic-like crystals of 2-30 m on a side (Fig. 3a), which consisted of relatively larger crystals than others.By using the KCl flux, a mixture of small roundish particles of 0.1-0.5 m in diameter and long rod-like crystals of 3-8 m in length was obtained in this condition (Fig. 3b).The NaCl flux provided polyhedral particles of 1-7 m in diameter (Fig. 3c), where some facets were found on the surfaces.The CTO(SS,1273) sample showed tightly connected roundish and polyhedral particles (Fig. 3d).The size of the particles observed in these SEM images was in the range of 0.1-30 m.On the other hand, the average crystallites sizes of these samples determined from XRD were ranged between 25 and 100 nm (Table 1).This discrepancy indicates that these particles of unique morphology observed in the SEM images would not be single crystals but polycrystals. Although the color of the prepared CTO sample slightly varied with the preparation condition, most of them seemed pale purple or pale pink.Fig. 4 shows DR UV-Visible spectra of the representative CTO samples.The adsorption edge is observed around 350 nm in wavelength for each samples.The estimated bandgap of these samples was around 3.6 eV (Table 1).Among these samples, it would be said that the sample consisting of larger crystallites tended to exhibit smaller bandgap.The CTO(SS,1273) sample exhibited also a shoulder band around 350-400 nm in wavelength (Fig. 4e), which might originate from electron transition from the valence band to shallow trap sites below the conduction band due to oxygen vacancies, or from unreacted TiO 2 .Since no TiO 2 phase was detected in the XRD profiles, it should be amorphous TiO 2 species if existed.Anyway, judging from the color of the sample, there would be some kinds of defects on the CTO(SS,1273) sample.The CTO(CaCl 2 ,5) sample exhibited also a similar band in the range of 350-420 nm in wavelength as well as a broad absorption band in the visible light region of 420-800 nm (Fig. 4a).The latter would originate from some kinds of lattice defects or surface defects like as color centers.This means that the CTO(CaCl 2 ,5) sample had some kinds of defects although it consisted of the large cubic-like crystals shown in the SEM image (Fig. 3a).In Table 1, BET specific surface area of the samples were listed, and the CTO(CaCl 2 ,5) sample exhibited a large value.These facts suggest that the large cubic-like crystals might be microporous although it could not be recognized on the SEM image.The CTO(NaCl,5) and CTO(NaCl,40) samples showed only a very week and broad absorption band in this visible light region (Fig. 4c andd), implying that these samples had less defects than the CTO(CaCl 2 ,5) and CTO(SS,1273) samples.The CTO(KCl,5) sample showed no absorption in the range of longer than 350 nm in wavelength (Fig. 4b), suggesting that this sample had the lowest amount of such kind of defects among these samples. Photocatalytic tests for CO 2 reduction with H 2 O as a reductant without using any sacrificial reagents were carried out in a flow reactor, where the formation rates for each product were determined.Fig. 5 shows the time course of the production rates on the Ag(0.5)/CTO(NaCl,40)sample.The products were CO, H 2 , and O 2 , where CO was the reduction product from CO 2 and H 2 was produced by water splitting as a competitive reaction 11121314.The production rates of CO and H 2 were initially high but decreased steeply in the initial period for 5 h.After this unstable period, the production rate of CO and H 2 became constant.On the other hand, evolution of O 2 was not observed at the initial stage, where oxygen might be adsorbed on the surface of photocatalyst 3435363738 or consumption for oxidizing the photocatalyst or Ag cocatalyst.After the initial period, the production rate of O 2 also became constant.In the present reaction system, it is suggested that the above mentioned reactions shown in Eqs. (1)-(3) would take place.Without Ag cocatalyst, or without the photoirradiation, the reaction did not proceed.The reaction continuously lasted in the constant rate even after 24 h.Thus, it is proposed that the reaction would photocatalytically proceed in the constant rate, at least at the steady state after the initial period. The Ag cocatalyst would receive the photoexcited electrons from the conduction band of the CaTiO 3 semiconductor and function as the reduction sites for production of CO and H 2 shown in Eqs. ( 1) and ( 2), respectively.Since other cocatalysts such as Pt, Rh, and Pd did not promote the production of CO and Cu cocatalyst promoted CO formation at very low rate (0.016 mol h -1 ), the Ag cocatalyst is especially important for CO 2 reduction to produce CO on the present photocatalyst.This would be related to the less adsorption ability of Ag metal for CO molecule. Table 2 shows the production rates after 5 and 20 h from the start of the photocatalytic reaction.It is obvious that the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 proceeded over all the Ag-loaded CaTiO 3 samples.The selectivity to CO, i.e., the reaction selectivity for CO 2 reduction, was also listed in Table 2, which much varied with the sample.The consumed ratio of the electrons and holes (e -/h ) was also listed in Table 2, which should be unity since photocatalysis must consume equivalent amounts of photoexcited electrons and holes, and most of the samples actually showed the e -/h ratio close to unity at the steady state (20 h later).As for the samples of low activity, the oxygen evolution rate was often not determined correctly. The three samples prepared by the different flux with the same solute concentration, the Ag(0.1)/CTO(CaCl 2 ,5), Ag(0.1)/CTO(KCl,5) and Ag(0.1)/CTO(NaCl,5) samples, exhibited stable production rates at 20 h later, and the e -/h values became closed to unity (Table 2, entries 1-3), suggesting that the photocatalytic reaction clearly proceeded on each sample.However, the selectivity was different from each other.The Ag(0.1)/CTO(CaCl 2 ,5) sample of unique cubic-like morphology exhibited high and selective photocatalytic activity for not CO 2 reduction but water splitting to produce H 2 and O 2 .This sample had larger size of crystallites and larger surface area (Table 1, entry 1), which might contribute to the high and selective photocatalytic activity for water splitting although this sample showed some absorption band probably due to defects (Fig. 4a).On the other hand, the Ag(0.1)/CTO(NaCl,5)sample showed the highest CO selectivity among the three samples (Table 1, entry 3).This Ag(0.1)/CTO(NaCl,5) sample prepared by the flux method was higher than the Ag(0.1)/CTO(SS,1273) and Ag(0.1)/CTO(SS,1373) sample prepared by the solid state reaction method (Table 1, entries 10 and 11). Thus, the effect of the solute concentration was examined on the Ag(y)/CTO(NaCl, x) samples, which results were listed in Table 2, entries 3-5 for the Ag(0.1)/CTO(NaCl,x) samples and entries 6-10 for the Ag(0.5)/CTO(NaCl,x) samples.The CO production rate and CO selectivity were plotted in Fig. 6A.Both the CO production rates and the CO selectivity on both the Ag(0.1)/CTO(NaCl,x) samples and the Ag(0.5)/CTO(NaCl,x) samples presented each volcano plot upon the solute concentration, where the Ag(0.1)/CTO(NaCl,50)sample and the Ag(0.5)/CTO(NaCl,40)sample corresponded to the peaks of the volcano plots for the Ag(0.1)/CTO(NaCl,x) samples and the Ag(0.5)/CTO(NaCl,x) samples, respectively.The most active one in the present study was the Ag(0.5)/CTO(NaCl,40)sample, which exhibited the CO production rate of 0.35 mol h -1 and the selectivity for the CO 2 reduction was as high as 45 (Table 2 entry 7).It is noted that the CO production rates over these samples prepared by the flux method (Table 2, entries 4 and 7) were 10 times higher than that over the samples prepared by the solid state reaction method (Table 2, entries 11 and 12).The CO selectivity was also obviously higher for these samples prepared by the flux method than those by the solid state reaction method.Fig. 7 shows some representative FE-SEM images of these CTO samples before loading Ag cocatalyst.All the samples consisted of the polyhedral particles covered with many facets.The particle size observed in the images varied with the solute concentration and it is clear that the CTO(NaCl,40) sample had the larger polyhedral polycrystals than others.The average particle sizes of the polycrystals estimated from the SEM images for the CTO(NaCl,x) samples were plotted upon the solute concentration in Fig. 6B.It is interesting that the similar volcano plot appeared as Fig. 6A.Thus, the CO production rates were plotted versus the average size of the polycrystals as shown in Fig. 8.As clearly shown, the CO production rate and the average size of the polycrystals showed a good correlation.It is proposed that the larger polyhedral polycrystals loaded with Ag cocatalyst would be advantageous for the higher photocatalytic activity for the CO 2 reduction.As shown in Fig. 4d, the CTO(NaCl,40) sample would have less defects than the CTO(NaCl,5) sample.These results suggest that the large polyhedral polycrystals with the flat facets and with fewer defects would be suitable for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with water to produce CO. In order to elucidate the reason why the CO production rate decreased with time at the initial stage as shown in Fig. 5, the state of the Ag particles on the Ag(0.1)/CTO(NaCl,50)sample before and after the reaction test were examined.This photocatalyst also exhibited the constant activity for producing CO and H 2 after initial period for 5 h until 24 h later (not shown but similar to Fig. 5).In the DR UV-Visible spectra (Fig. 9a), the sample before use exhibited a broad band with the maximum at 470 nm in wavelength assignable to the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of the Ag nanoparticles.After the use in the photocatalytic reaction, the band maximum shifted to shorter wavelength around 420 nm (Fig. 9b), suggesting the variation of the state of the Ag nanoparticle, i.e., the particle size of the Ag nanoparticle would become slightly smaller.Fig. 10 shows the FE-SEM images recorded in a reflection mode, where the Ag particles could be observed as while dots (highlighted by the circles).On the Ag(0.1)/CTO(NaCl,50)sample, various size of Ag nanoparticles were scattered before the reaction (Fig. 10a), while the particles were located on some specific large and flat facets after the reaction test for 24 h (Fig. 10b).Generally, it is considered that the photoformed holes and electrons can oxidize and reduce both deposited nanoparticles and adsorbed molecules and ions on the photocatalyst surface.In the present study, since the Ag nanoparticles were deposited by the photodeposition method under air atmosphere and Ag might be photoreduced before adsorbed by the photocatalyst surface, the Ag nanoparticles might be partially oxidized or deposited even on the oxidative sites.This means that the metallic Ag atom in the Ag nanoparticles on the oxidative sites can be oxidized to Ag cation and released from the metallic particles while the released Ag cation can be reduced to form metallic Ag nanoparticles on the reductive sites.If the facets on the polyhedral polycrystals could be divided into oxidative and reductive facets, Ag nanoparticles on the oxidative facets would disappear and Ag nanoparticles on the reductive facets would be stabilized to function as the reductive sites for CO 2 reduction.On the CTO(NaCl,50) sample, several large polygonal facets on the polyhedral particles were observed in the SEM images (Fig. 10a andb).Before the reaction the Ag nanoparticles were dispersed on many facets.After the photocatalytic reaction, many Ag nanoparticles were found on some specific facets, where the Ag cocatalyst did not aggregate.This suggests that the Ag nanoparticles would be well stabilized on the large facets even after the photocatalytic reaction test.These facets would be the reductive facets.This dispersed and stabilized state of the Ag nanoparticles on the large and flat reductive facets would contribute to the constant and high photocatalytic activity in the steady state. On the other hand, the activity for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction of the Ag(0.1)/CTO(SS,1273)sample gradually decreased for 20 h while the activity for water splitting maintained (Table 2, entry 11).The CTO(SS,1273) sample consisted of roundish particles connected together, where no large facets were observed (Fig. 10c andd).Although the Ag nanoparticles were dispersed on the surface before the reaction test (Fig. 10c), they aggregated so much after the reaction test probably due to the lack of the large flat facets (Fig. 10d).Thus, it is proposed that the aggregation of the Ag cocatalyst would be the reason for the decrease of the photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction.These facts suggest that the CO 2 reduction to CO would take place on the Ag cocatalyst surface and the water splitting to produce H 2 would dominantly occur on the surface of the CaTiO 3 photocatalyst.The high and stable photocatalytic activity of the Ag/CaTiO 3 photocatalysts prepared with NaCl flux for CO 2 reduction would be achieved with the large flat facets stabilizing the Ag nanoparticles as the specific cocatalyst for CO formation.Although the positive effect of the large size of particles has been also reported and explained by the reduction of the recombination of the photoexcited electron and hole pairs, for example, for WO 3 photocatalyst 39, the reason for the size effect in the present study would be different from the reported case."}, {"llm generation": "Pt, Rh, Pd, Cu", "source": "Since other cocatalysts such as Pt, Rh, and Pd did not promote the production of CO and Cu cocatalyst promoted CO formation at very low rate (0.016 mol h -1 ), the Ag cocatalyst is especially important for CO 2 reduction to produce CO on the present photocatalyst.", "context": "Fig. 2 shows XRD patterns of representative CaTiO 3 samples and a calculated one from a database (ICSD 74212).All the CTO samples exhibited clear diffraction lines assignable to CaTiO 3 crystal and no other diffraction lines from impurity was observed in these profiles, indicating that these prepared CTO samples predominantly consisted of the CaTiO 3 crystallites.It is noted that any kind of flux such as CaCl 2 , KCl and NaCl provided CaTiO 3 crystallites.Even when excess amount of molten CaCl 2 was used as a flux, no other calcium-rich compounds such as Ca 3 Ti 2 O 7 and Ca 4 Ti 3 O 10 33 were formed.This result revealed that the composition of calcium titanate would be determined by not the solute concentration (x mol) in the molten salt mixture and the kind of the flux but the atomic ratio of the starting materials, i.e., CaCO 3 and TiO 2 .In the present case, the atomic ratio of Ca and Ti was unity, which thus provided CaTiO 3 crystallites.In other words, the CaTiO 3 crystallites would originate from TiO 2 and CaCO 3 .It is considered that CaO clusters dissolved in the molten salt, which could be formed from CaCO 3 by thermal decomposition, would predominantly react with dissolved TiO 2 clusters to form the CaTiO 3 crystallites, while Ca 2 cation of the CaCl 2 flux could not react with TiO 2 species in the present condition, as previously discussed 25.It is also noted that, even the crystallization of CaTiO 3 took place in other molten salts, such as KCl and NaCl, no compounds containing K and Na would be formed.Thus, it is clear that these alkali chloride fluxes such as CaCl 2 , KCl and NaCl could not react with TiO 2 and could not exchange with the Ca cation in the crystallites of CaTiO 3 in this condition.The average crystallites size of the samples were estimated from XRD profiles (Table 1), which clarified that the CTO(CaCl 2 ,5) sample obviously had larger crystallites than others. The FE-SEM images revealed that the use of CaCl 2 , KCl and NaCl as a flux gave various morphologies.In some cases, various facets could be found on their surfaces.The CaCl 2 flux gave clear and large cubic-like crystals of 2-30 m on a side (Fig. 3a), which consisted of relatively larger crystals than others.By using the KCl flux, a mixture of small roundish particles of 0.1-0.5 m in diameter and long rod-like crystals of 3-8 m in length was obtained in this condition (Fig. 3b).The NaCl flux provided polyhedral particles of 1-7 m in diameter (Fig. 3c), where some facets were found on the surfaces.The CTO(SS,1273) sample showed tightly connected roundish and polyhedral particles (Fig. 3d).The size of the particles observed in these SEM images was in the range of 0.1-30 m.On the other hand, the average crystallites sizes of these samples determined from XRD were ranged between 25 and 100 nm (Table 1).This discrepancy indicates that these particles of unique morphology observed in the SEM images would not be single crystals but polycrystals. Although the color of the prepared CTO sample slightly varied with the preparation condition, most of them seemed pale purple or pale pink.Fig. 4 shows DR UV-Visible spectra of the representative CTO samples.The adsorption edge is observed around 350 nm in wavelength for each samples.The estimated bandgap of these samples was around 3.6 eV (Table 1).Among these samples, it would be said that the sample consisting of larger crystallites tended to exhibit smaller bandgap.The CTO(SS,1273) sample exhibited also a shoulder band around 350-400 nm in wavelength (Fig. 4e), which might originate from electron transition from the valence band to shallow trap sites below the conduction band due to oxygen vacancies, or from unreacted TiO 2 .Since no TiO 2 phase was detected in the XRD profiles, it should be amorphous TiO 2 species if existed.Anyway, judging from the color of the sample, there would be some kinds of defects on the CTO(SS,1273) sample.The CTO(CaCl 2 ,5) sample exhibited also a similar band in the range of 350-420 nm in wavelength as well as a broad absorption band in the visible light region of 420-800 nm (Fig. 4a).The latter would originate from some kinds of lattice defects or surface defects like as color centers.This means that the CTO(CaCl 2 ,5) sample had some kinds of defects although it consisted of the large cubic-like crystals shown in the SEM image (Fig. 3a).In Table 1, BET specific surface area of the samples were listed, and the CTO(CaCl 2 ,5) sample exhibited a large value.These facts suggest that the large cubic-like crystals might be microporous although it could not be recognized on the SEM image.The CTO(NaCl,5) and CTO(NaCl,40) samples showed only a very week and broad absorption band in this visible light region (Fig. 4c andd), implying that these samples had less defects than the CTO(CaCl 2 ,5) and CTO(SS,1273) samples.The CTO(KCl,5) sample showed no absorption in the range of longer than 350 nm in wavelength (Fig. 4b), suggesting that this sample had the lowest amount of such kind of defects among these samples. Photocatalytic tests for CO 2 reduction with H 2 O as a reductant without using any sacrificial reagents were carried out in a flow reactor, where the formation rates for each product were determined.Fig. 5 shows the time course of the production rates on the Ag(0.5)/CTO(NaCl,40)sample.The products were CO, H 2 , and O 2 , where CO was the reduction product from CO 2 and H 2 was produced by water splitting as a competitive reaction 11121314.The production rates of CO and H 2 were initially high but decreased steeply in the initial period for 5 h.After this unstable period, the production rate of CO and H 2 became constant.On the other hand, evolution of O 2 was not observed at the initial stage, where oxygen might be adsorbed on the surface of photocatalyst 3435363738 or consumption for oxidizing the photocatalyst or Ag cocatalyst.After the initial period, the production rate of O 2 also became constant.In the present reaction system, it is suggested that the above mentioned reactions shown in Eqs. (1)-(3) would take place.Without Ag cocatalyst, or without the photoirradiation, the reaction did not proceed.The reaction continuously lasted in the constant rate even after 24 h.Thus, it is proposed that the reaction would photocatalytically proceed in the constant rate, at least at the steady state after the initial period. The Ag cocatalyst would receive the photoexcited electrons from the conduction band of the CaTiO 3 semiconductor and function as the reduction sites for production of CO and H 2 shown in Eqs. ( 1) and ( 2), respectively.Since other cocatalysts such as Pt, Rh, and Pd did not promote the production of CO and Cu cocatalyst promoted CO formation at very low rate (0.016 mol h -1 ), the Ag cocatalyst is especially important for CO 2 reduction to produce CO on the present photocatalyst.This would be related to the less adsorption ability of Ag metal for CO molecule. Table 2 shows the production rates after 5 and 20 h from the start of the photocatalytic reaction.It is obvious that the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 proceeded over all the Ag-loaded CaTiO 3 samples.The selectivity to CO, i.e., the reaction selectivity for CO 2 reduction, was also listed in Table 2, which much varied with the sample.The consumed ratio of the electrons and holes (e -/h ) was also listed in Table 2, which should be unity since photocatalysis must consume equivalent amounts of photoexcited electrons and holes, and most of the samples actually showed the e -/h ratio close to unity at the steady state (20 h later).As for the samples of low activity, the oxygen evolution rate was often not determined correctly. The three samples prepared by the different flux with the same solute concentration, the Ag(0.1)/CTO(CaCl 2 ,5), Ag(0.1)/CTO(KCl,5) and Ag(0.1)/CTO(NaCl,5) samples, exhibited stable production rates at 20 h later, and the e -/h values became closed to unity (Table 2, entries 1-3), suggesting that the photocatalytic reaction clearly proceeded on each sample.However, the selectivity was different from each other.The Ag(0.1)/CTO(CaCl 2 ,5) sample of unique cubic-like morphology exhibited high and selective photocatalytic activity for not CO 2 reduction but water splitting to produce H 2 and O 2 .This sample had larger size of crystallites and larger surface area (Table 1, entry 1), which might contribute to the high and selective photocatalytic activity for water splitting although this sample showed some absorption band probably due to defects (Fig. 4a).On the other hand, the Ag(0.1)/CTO(NaCl,5)sample showed the highest CO selectivity among the three samples (Table 1, entry 3).This Ag(0.1)/CTO(NaCl,5) sample prepared by the flux method was higher than the Ag(0.1)/CTO(SS,1273) and Ag(0.1)/CTO(SS,1373) sample prepared by the solid state reaction method (Table 1, entries 10 and 11). Thus, the effect of the solute concentration was examined on the Ag(y)/CTO(NaCl, x) samples, which results were listed in Table 2, entries 3-5 for the Ag(0.1)/CTO(NaCl,x) samples and entries 6-10 for the Ag(0.5)/CTO(NaCl,x) samples.The CO production rate and CO selectivity were plotted in Fig. 6A.Both the CO production rates and the CO selectivity on both the Ag(0.1)/CTO(NaCl,x) samples and the Ag(0.5)/CTO(NaCl,x) samples presented each volcano plot upon the solute concentration, where the Ag(0.1)/CTO(NaCl,50)sample and the Ag(0.5)/CTO(NaCl,40)sample corresponded to the peaks of the volcano plots for the Ag(0.1)/CTO(NaCl,x) samples and the Ag(0.5)/CTO(NaCl,x) samples, respectively.The most active one in the present study was the Ag(0.5)/CTO(NaCl,40)sample, which exhibited the CO production rate of 0.35 mol h -1 and the selectivity for the CO 2 reduction was as high as 45 (Table 2 entry 7).It is noted that the CO production rates over these samples prepared by the flux method (Table 2, entries 4 and 7) were 10 times higher than that over the samples prepared by the solid state reaction method (Table 2, entries 11 and 12).The CO selectivity was also obviously higher for these samples prepared by the flux method than those by the solid state reaction method.Fig. 7 shows some representative FE-SEM images of these CTO samples before loading Ag cocatalyst.All the samples consisted of the polyhedral particles covered with many facets.The particle size observed in the images varied with the solute concentration and it is clear that the CTO(NaCl,40) sample had the larger polyhedral polycrystals than others.The average particle sizes of the polycrystals estimated from the SEM images for the CTO(NaCl,x) samples were plotted upon the solute concentration in Fig. 6B.It is interesting that the similar volcano plot appeared as Fig. 6A.Thus, the CO production rates were plotted versus the average size of the polycrystals as shown in Fig. 8.As clearly shown, the CO production rate and the average size of the polycrystals showed a good correlation.It is proposed that the larger polyhedral polycrystals loaded with Ag cocatalyst would be advantageous for the higher photocatalytic activity for the CO 2 reduction.As shown in Fig. 4d, the CTO(NaCl,40) sample would have less defects than the CTO(NaCl,5) sample.These results suggest that the large polyhedral polycrystals with the flat facets and with fewer defects would be suitable for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with water to produce CO. In order to elucidate the reason why the CO production rate decreased with time at the initial stage as shown in Fig. 5, the state of the Ag particles on the Ag(0.1)/CTO(NaCl,50)sample before and after the reaction test were examined.This photocatalyst also exhibited the constant activity for producing CO and H 2 after initial period for 5 h until 24 h later (not shown but similar to Fig. 5).In the DR UV-Visible spectra (Fig. 9a), the sample before use exhibited a broad band with the maximum at 470 nm in wavelength assignable to the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of the Ag nanoparticles.After the use in the photocatalytic reaction, the band maximum shifted to shorter wavelength around 420 nm (Fig. 9b), suggesting the variation of the state of the Ag nanoparticle, i.e., the particle size of the Ag nanoparticle would become slightly smaller.Fig. 10 shows the FE-SEM images recorded in a reflection mode, where the Ag particles could be observed as while dots (highlighted by the circles).On the Ag(0.1)/CTO(NaCl,50)sample, various size of Ag nanoparticles were scattered before the reaction (Fig. 10a), while the particles were located on some specific large and flat facets after the reaction test for 24 h (Fig. 10b).Generally, it is considered that the photoformed holes and electrons can oxidize and reduce both deposited nanoparticles and adsorbed molecules and ions on the photocatalyst surface.In the present study, since the Ag nanoparticles were deposited by the photodeposition method under air atmosphere and Ag might be photoreduced before adsorbed by the photocatalyst surface, the Ag nanoparticles might be partially oxidized or deposited even on the oxidative sites.This means that the metallic Ag atom in the Ag nanoparticles on the oxidative sites can be oxidized to Ag cation and released from the metallic particles while the released Ag cation can be reduced to form metallic Ag nanoparticles on the reductive sites.If the facets on the polyhedral polycrystals could be divided into oxidative and reductive facets, Ag nanoparticles on the oxidative facets would disappear and Ag nanoparticles on the reductive facets would be stabilized to function as the reductive sites for CO 2 reduction.On the CTO(NaCl,50) sample, several large polygonal facets on the polyhedral particles were observed in the SEM images (Fig. 10a andb).Before the reaction the Ag nanoparticles were dispersed on many facets.After the photocatalytic reaction, many Ag nanoparticles were found on some specific facets, where the Ag cocatalyst did not aggregate.This suggests that the Ag nanoparticles would be well stabilized on the large facets even after the photocatalytic reaction test.These facets would be the reductive facets.This dispersed and stabilized state of the Ag nanoparticles on the large and flat reductive facets would contribute to the constant and high photocatalytic activity in the steady state.

All the samples promoted the photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction with water to produce CO and O 2 and water splitting to produce H 2 and O 2 , where the two reactions competitively proceeded.The polyhedral CaTiO 3 photocatalyst with Ag cocatalyst exhibited a high and stable activity for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 , which was 10 times higher than the Ag-loaded CaTiO 3 sample prepared by the solid state reaction method.It was revealed that the CO 2 reduction for CO formation take place especially on the Ag cocatalyst, while the water splitting can proceed on the surface of CaTiO 3 photocatalyst.The large flat facets on the polyhedral CaTiO 3 particles of polycrystals would stabilize the Ag nanoparticles to promote the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to CO.The most active photocatalyst prepared in the present study was the Ag(0.5)/CTO(NaCl,40)sample, which exhibited the CO production rate of 0.35 mol h -1 (0.2 g of the photocatalyst with the light of 0.35 W measured in the range of 254 10 nm) and the selectivity for the CO 2 reduction was 45 at the steady state.

The FE-SEM images revealed that the use of CaCl 2 , KCl and NaCl as a flux gave various morphologies.In some cases, various facets could be found on their surfaces.The CaCl 2 flux gave clear and large cubic-like crystals of 2-30 m on a side (Fig. 3a), which consisted of relatively larger crystals than others.By using the KCl flux, a mixture of small roundish particles of 0.1-0.5 m in diameter and long rod-like crystals of 3-8 m in length was obtained in this condition (Fig. 3b).The NaCl flux provided polyhedral particles of 1-7 m in diameter (Fig. 3c), where some facets were found on the surfaces.The CTO(SS,1273) sample showed tightly connected roundish and polyhedral particles (Fig. 3d).The size of the particles observed in these SEM images was in the range of 0.1-30 m.On the other hand, the average crystallites sizes of these samples determined from XRD were ranged between 25 and 100 nm (Table 1).This discrepancy indicates that these particles of unique morphology observed in the SEM images would not be single crystals but polycrystals. Although the color of the prepared CTO sample slightly varied with the preparation condition, most of them seemed pale purple or pale pink.Fig. 4 shows DR UV-Visible spectra of the representative CTO samples.The adsorption edge is observed around 350 nm in wavelength for each samples.The estimated bandgap of these samples was around 3.6 eV (Table 1).Among these samples, it would be said that the sample consisting of larger crystallites tended to exhibit smaller bandgap.The CTO(SS,1273) sample exhibited also a shoulder band around 350-400 nm in wavelength (Fig. 4e), which might originate from electron transition from the valence band to shallow trap sites below the conduction band due to oxygen vacancies, or from unreacted TiO 2 .Since no TiO 2 phase was detected in the XRD profiles, it should be amorphous TiO 2 species if existed.Anyway, judging from the color of the sample, there would be some kinds of defects on the CTO(SS,1273) sample.The CTO(CaCl 2 ,5) sample exhibited also a similar band in the range of 350-420 nm in wavelength as well as a broad absorption band in the visible light region of 420-800 nm (Fig. 4a).The latter would originate from some kinds of lattice defects or surface defects like as color centers.This means that the CTO(CaCl 2 ,5) sample had some kinds of defects although it consisted of the large cubic-like crystals shown in the SEM image (Fig. 3a).In Table 1, BET specific surface area of the samples were listed, and the CTO(CaCl 2 ,5) sample exhibited a large value.These facts suggest that the large cubic-like crystals might be microporous although it could not be recognized on the SEM image.The CTO(NaCl,5) and CTO(NaCl,40) samples showed only a very week and broad absorption band in this visible light region (Fig. 4c andd), implying that these samples had less defects than the CTO(CaCl 2 ,5) and CTO(SS,1273) samples.The CTO(KCl,5) sample showed no absorption in the range of longer than 350 nm in wavelength (Fig. 4b), suggesting that this sample had the lowest amount of such kind of defects among these samples. Photocatalytic tests for CO 2 reduction with H 2 O as a reductant without using any sacrificial reagents were carried out in a flow reactor, where the formation rates for each product were determined.Fig. 5 shows the time course of the production rates on the Ag(0.5)/CTO(NaCl,40)sample.The products were CO, H 2 , and O 2 , where CO was the reduction product from CO 2 and H 2 was produced by water splitting as a competitive reaction 11121314.The production rates of CO and H 2 were initially high but decreased steeply in the initial period for 5 h.After this unstable period, the production rate of CO and H 2 became constant.On the other hand, evolution of O 2 was not observed at the initial stage, where oxygen might be adsorbed on the surface of photocatalyst 3435363738 or consumption for oxidizing the photocatalyst or Ag cocatalyst.After the initial period, the production rate of O 2 also became constant.In the present reaction system, it is suggested that the above mentioned reactions shown in Eqs. (1)-(3) would take place.Without Ag cocatalyst, or without the photoirradiation, the reaction did not proceed.The reaction continuously lasted in the constant rate even after 24 h.Thus, it is proposed that the reaction would photocatalytically proceed in the constant rate, at least at the steady state after the initial period. The Ag cocatalyst would receive the photoexcited electrons from the conduction band of the CaTiO 3 semiconductor and function as the reduction sites for production of CO and H 2 shown in Eqs. ( 1) and ( 2), respectively.Since other cocatalysts such as Pt, Rh, and Pd did not promote the production of CO and Cu cocatalyst promoted CO formation at very low rate (0.016 mol h -1 ), the Ag cocatalyst is especially important for CO 2 reduction to produce CO on the present photocatalyst.This would be related to the less adsorption ability of Ag metal for CO molecule. Table 2 shows the production rates after 5 and 20 h from the start of the photocatalytic reaction.It is obvious that the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 proceeded over all the Ag-loaded CaTiO 3 samples.The selectivity to CO, i.e., the reaction selectivity for CO 2 reduction, was also listed in Table 2, which much varied with the sample.The consumed ratio of the electrons and holes (e -/h ) was also listed in Table 2, which should be unity since photocatalysis must consume equivalent amounts of photoexcited electrons and holes, and most of the samples actually showed the e -/h ratio close to unity at the steady state (20 h later).As for the samples of low activity, the oxygen evolution rate was often not determined correctly. The three samples prepared by the different flux with the same solute concentration, the Ag(0.1)/CTO(CaCl 2 ,5), Ag(0.1)/CTO(KCl,5) and Ag(0.1)/CTO(NaCl,5) samples, exhibited stable production rates at 20 h later, and the e -/h values became closed to unity (Table 2, entries 1-3), suggesting that the photocatalytic reaction clearly proceeded on each sample.However, the selectivity was different from each other.The Ag(0.1)/CTO(CaCl 2 ,5) sample of unique cubic-like morphology exhibited high and selective photocatalytic activity for not CO 2 reduction but water splitting to produce H 2 and O 2 .This sample had larger size of crystallites and larger surface area (Table 1, entry 1), which might contribute to the high and selective photocatalytic activity for water splitting although this sample showed some absorption band probably due to defects (Fig. 4a).On the other hand, the Ag(0.1)/CTO(NaCl,5)sample showed the highest CO selectivity among the three samples (Table 1, entry 3).This Ag(0.1)/CTO(NaCl,5) sample prepared by the flux method was higher than the Ag(0.1)/CTO(SS,1273) and Ag(0.1)/CTO(SS,1373) sample prepared by the solid state reaction method (Table 1, entries 10 and 11). Thus, the effect of the solute concentration was examined on the Ag(y)/CTO(NaCl, x) samples, which results were listed in Table 2, entries 3-5 for the Ag(0.1)/CTO(NaCl,x) samples and entries 6-10 for the Ag(0.5)/CTO(NaCl,x) samples.The CO production rate and CO selectivity were plotted in Fig. 6A.Both the CO production rates and the CO selectivity on both the Ag(0.1)/CTO(NaCl,x) samples and the Ag(0.5)/CTO(NaCl,x) samples presented each volcano plot upon the solute concentration, where the Ag(0.1)/CTO(NaCl,50)sample and the Ag(0.5)/CTO(NaCl,40)sample corresponded to the peaks of the volcano plots for the Ag(0.1)/CTO(NaCl,x) samples and the Ag(0.5)/CTO(NaCl,x) samples, respectively.The most active one in the present study was the Ag(0.5)/CTO(NaCl,40)sample, which exhibited the CO production rate of 0.35 mol h -1 and the selectivity for the CO 2 reduction was as high as 45 (Table 2 entry 7).It is noted that the CO production rates over these samples prepared by the flux method (Table 2, entries 4 and 7) were 10 times higher than that over the samples prepared by the solid state reaction method (Table 2, entries 11 and 12).The CO selectivity was also obviously higher for these samples prepared by the flux method than those by the solid state reaction method.Fig. 7 shows some representative FE-SEM images of these CTO samples before loading Ag cocatalyst.All the samples consisted of the polyhedral particles covered with many facets.The particle size observed in the images varied with the solute concentration and it is clear that the CTO(NaCl,40) sample had the larger polyhedral polycrystals than others.The average particle sizes of the polycrystals estimated from the SEM images for the CTO(NaCl,x) samples were plotted upon the solute concentration in Fig. 6B.It is interesting that the similar volcano plot appeared as Fig. 6A.Thus, the CO production rates were plotted versus the average size of the polycrystals as shown in Fig. 8.As clearly shown, the CO production rate and the average size of the polycrystals showed a good correlation.It is proposed that the larger polyhedral polycrystals loaded with Ag cocatalyst would be advantageous for the higher photocatalytic activity for the CO 2 reduction.As shown in Fig. 4d, the CTO(NaCl,40) sample would have less defects than the CTO(NaCl,5) sample.These results suggest that the large polyhedral polycrystals with the flat facets and with fewer defects would be suitable for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with water to produce CO. In order to elucidate the reason why the CO production rate decreased with time at the initial stage as shown in Fig. 5, the state of the Ag particles on the Ag(0.1)/CTO(NaCl,50)sample before and after the reaction test were examined.This photocatalyst also exhibited the constant activity for producing CO and H 2 after initial period for 5 h until 24 h later (not shown but similar to Fig. 5).In the DR UV-Visible spectra (Fig. 9a), the sample before use exhibited a broad band with the maximum at 470 nm in wavelength assignable to the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of the Ag nanoparticles.After the use in the photocatalytic reaction, the band maximum shifted to shorter wavelength around 420 nm (Fig. 9b), suggesting the variation of the state of the Ag nanoparticle, i.e., the particle size of the Ag nanoparticle would become slightly smaller.Fig. 10 shows the FE-SEM images recorded in a reflection mode, where the Ag particles could be observed as while dots (highlighted by the circles).On the Ag(0.1)/CTO(NaCl,50)sample, various size of Ag nanoparticles were scattered before the reaction (Fig. 10a), while the particles were located on some specific large and flat facets after the reaction test for 24 h (Fig. 10b).Generally, it is considered that the photoformed holes and electrons can oxidize and reduce both deposited nanoparticles and adsorbed molecules and ions on the photocatalyst surface.In the present study, since the Ag nanoparticles were deposited by the photodeposition method under air atmosphere and Ag might be photoreduced before adsorbed by the photocatalyst surface, the Ag nanoparticles might be partially oxidized or deposited even on the oxidative sites.This means that the metallic Ag atom in the Ag nanoparticles on the oxidative sites can be oxidized to Ag cation and released from the metallic particles while the released Ag cation can be reduced to form metallic Ag nanoparticles on the reductive sites.If the facets on the polyhedral polycrystals could be divided into oxidative and reductive facets, Ag nanoparticles on the oxidative facets would disappear and Ag nanoparticles on the reductive facets would be stabilized to function as the reductive sites for CO 2 reduction.On the CTO(NaCl,50) sample, several large polygonal facets on the polyhedral particles were observed in the SEM images (Fig. 10a andb).Before the reaction the Ag nanoparticles were dispersed on many facets.After the photocatalytic reaction, many Ag nanoparticles were found on some specific facets, where the Ag cocatalyst did not aggregate.This suggests that the Ag nanoparticles would be well stabilized on the large facets even after the photocatalytic reaction test.These facets would be the reductive facets.This dispersed and stabilized state of the Ag nanoparticles on the large and flat reductive facets would contribute to the constant and high photocatalytic activity in the steady state. On the other hand, the activity for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction of the Ag(0.1)/CTO(SS,1273)sample gradually decreased for 20 h while the activity for water splitting maintained (Table 2, entry 11).The CTO(SS,1273) sample consisted of roundish particles connected together, where no large facets were observed (Fig. 10c andd).Although the Ag nanoparticles were dispersed on the surface before the reaction test (Fig. 10c), they aggregated so much after the reaction test probably due to the lack of the large flat facets (Fig. 10d).Thus, it is proposed that the aggregation of the Ag cocatalyst would be the reason for the decrease of the photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction.These facts suggest that the CO 2 reduction to CO would take place on the Ag cocatalyst surface and the water splitting to produce H 2 would dominantly occur on the surface of the CaTiO 3 photocatalyst.The high and stable photocatalytic activity of the Ag/CaTiO 3 photocatalysts prepared with NaCl flux for CO 2 reduction would be achieved with the large flat facets stabilizing the Ag nanoparticles as the specific cocatalyst for CO formation.Although the positive effect of the large size of particles has been also reported and explained by the reduction of the recombination of the photoexcited electron and hole pairs, for example, for WO 3 photocatalyst 39, the reason for the size effect in the present study would be different from the reported case."}, {"llm generation": "Continuous", "source": "The reaction continuously lasted in the constant rate even after 24 h.", "context": "Fig. 2 shows XRD patterns of representative CaTiO 3 samples and a calculated one from a database (ICSD 74212).All the CTO samples exhibited clear diffraction lines assignable to CaTiO 3 crystal and no other diffraction lines from impurity was observed in these profiles, indicating that these prepared CTO samples predominantly consisted of the CaTiO 3 crystallites.It is noted that any kind of flux such as CaCl 2 , KCl and NaCl provided CaTiO 3 crystallites.Even when excess amount of molten CaCl 2 was used as a flux, no other calcium-rich compounds such as Ca 3 Ti 2 O 7 and Ca 4 Ti 3 O 10 33 were formed.This result revealed that the composition of calcium titanate would be determined by not the solute concentration (x mol) in the molten salt mixture and the kind of the flux but the atomic ratio of the starting materials, i.e., CaCO 3 and TiO 2 .In the present case, the atomic ratio of Ca and Ti was unity, which thus provided CaTiO 3 crystallites.In other words, the CaTiO 3 crystallites would originate from TiO 2 and CaCO 3 .It is considered that CaO clusters dissolved in the molten salt, which could be formed from CaCO 3 by thermal decomposition, would predominantly react with dissolved TiO 2 clusters to form the CaTiO 3 crystallites, while Ca 2 cation of the CaCl 2 flux could not react with TiO 2 species in the present condition, as previously discussed 25.It is also noted that, even the crystallization of CaTiO 3 took place in other molten salts, such as KCl and NaCl, no compounds containing K and Na would be formed.Thus, it is clear that these alkali chloride fluxes such as CaCl 2 , KCl and NaCl could not react with TiO 2 and could not exchange with the Ca cation in the crystallites of CaTiO 3 in this condition.The average crystallites size of the samples were estimated from XRD profiles (Table 1), which clarified that the CTO(CaCl 2 ,5) sample obviously had larger crystallites than others. The FE-SEM images revealed that the use of CaCl 2 , KCl and NaCl as a flux gave various morphologies.In some cases, various facets could be found on their surfaces.The CaCl 2 flux gave clear and large cubic-like crystals of 2-30 m on a side (Fig. 3a), which consisted of relatively larger crystals than others.By using the KCl flux, a mixture of small roundish particles of 0.1-0.5 m in diameter and long rod-like crystals of 3-8 m in length was obtained in this condition (Fig. 3b).The NaCl flux provided polyhedral particles of 1-7 m in diameter (Fig. 3c), where some facets were found on the surfaces.The CTO(SS,1273) sample showed tightly connected roundish and polyhedral particles (Fig. 3d).The size of the particles observed in these SEM images was in the range of 0.1-30 m.On the other hand, the average crystallites sizes of these samples determined from XRD were ranged between 25 and 100 nm (Table 1).This discrepancy indicates that these particles of unique morphology observed in the SEM images would not be single crystals but polycrystals. Although the color of the prepared CTO sample slightly varied with the preparation condition, most of them seemed pale purple or pale pink.Fig. 4 shows DR UV-Visible spectra of the representative CTO samples.The adsorption edge is observed around 350 nm in wavelength for each samples.The estimated bandgap of these samples was around 3.6 eV (Table 1).Among these samples, it would be said that the sample consisting of larger crystallites tended to exhibit smaller bandgap.The CTO(SS,1273) sample exhibited also a shoulder band around 350-400 nm in wavelength (Fig. 4e), which might originate from electron transition from the valence band to shallow trap sites below the conduction band due to oxygen vacancies, or from unreacted TiO 2 .Since no TiO 2 phase was detected in the XRD profiles, it should be amorphous TiO 2 species if existed.Anyway, judging from the color of the sample, there would be some kinds of defects on the CTO(SS,1273) sample.The CTO(CaCl 2 ,5) sample exhibited also a similar band in the range of 350-420 nm in wavelength as well as a broad absorption band in the visible light region of 420-800 nm (Fig. 4a).The latter would originate from some kinds of lattice defects or surface defects like as color centers.This means that the CTO(CaCl 2 ,5) sample had some kinds of defects although it consisted of the large cubic-like crystals shown in the SEM image (Fig. 3a).In Table 1, BET specific surface area of the samples were listed, and the CTO(CaCl 2 ,5) sample exhibited a large value.These facts suggest that the large cubic-like crystals might be microporous although it could not be recognized on the SEM image.The CTO(NaCl,5) and CTO(NaCl,40) samples showed only a very week and broad absorption band in this visible light region (Fig. 4c andd), implying that these samples had less defects than the CTO(CaCl 2 ,5) and CTO(SS,1273) samples.The CTO(KCl,5) sample showed no absorption in the range of longer than 350 nm in wavelength (Fig. 4b), suggesting that this sample had the lowest amount of such kind of defects among these samples. Photocatalytic tests for CO 2 reduction with H 2 O as a reductant without using any sacrificial reagents were carried out in a flow reactor, where the formation rates for each product were determined.Fig. 5 shows the time course of the production rates on the Ag(0.5)/CTO(NaCl,40)sample.The products were CO, H 2 , and O 2 , where CO was the reduction product from CO 2 and H 2 was produced by water splitting as a competitive reaction 11121314.The production rates of CO and H 2 were initially high but decreased steeply in the initial period for 5 h.After this unstable period, the production rate of CO and H 2 became constant.On the other hand, evolution of O 2 was not observed at the initial stage, where oxygen might be adsorbed on the surface of photocatalyst 3435363738 or consumption for oxidizing the photocatalyst or Ag cocatalyst.After the initial period, the production rate of O 2 also became constant.In the present reaction system, it is suggested that the above mentioned reactions shown in Eqs. (1)-(3) would take place.Without Ag cocatalyst, or without the photoirradiation, the reaction did not proceed.The reaction continuously lasted in the constant rate even after 24 h.Thus, it is proposed that the reaction would photocatalytically proceed in the constant rate, at least at the steady state after the initial period. The Ag cocatalyst would receive the photoexcited electrons from the conduction band of the CaTiO 3 semiconductor and function as the reduction sites for production of CO and H 2 shown in Eqs. ( 1) and ( 2), respectively.Since other cocatalysts such as Pt, Rh, and Pd did not promote the production of CO and Cu cocatalyst promoted CO formation at very low rate (0.016 mol h -1 ), the Ag cocatalyst is especially important for CO 2 reduction to produce CO on the present photocatalyst.This would be related to the less adsorption ability of Ag metal for CO molecule. Table 2 shows the production rates after 5 and 20 h from the start of the photocatalytic reaction.It is obvious that the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 proceeded over all the Ag-loaded CaTiO 3 samples.The selectivity to CO, i.e., the reaction selectivity for CO 2 reduction, was also listed in Table 2, which much varied with the sample.The consumed ratio of the electrons and holes (e -/h ) was also listed in Table 2, which should be unity since photocatalysis must consume equivalent amounts of photoexcited electrons and holes, and most of the samples actually showed the e -/h ratio close to unity at the steady state (20 h later).As for the samples of low activity, the oxygen evolution rate was often not determined correctly. The three samples prepared by the different flux with the same solute concentration, the Ag(0.1)/CTO(CaCl 2 ,5), Ag(0.1)/CTO(KCl,5) and Ag(0.1)/CTO(NaCl,5) samples, exhibited stable production rates at 20 h later, and the e -/h values became closed to unity (Table 2, entries 1-3), suggesting that the photocatalytic reaction clearly proceeded on each sample.However, the selectivity was different from each other.The Ag(0.1)/CTO(CaCl 2 ,5) sample of unique cubic-like morphology exhibited high and selective photocatalytic activity for not CO 2 reduction but water splitting to produce H 2 and O 2 .This sample had larger size of crystallites and larger surface area (Table 1, entry 1), which might contribute to the high and selective photocatalytic activity for water splitting although this sample showed some absorption band probably due to defects (Fig. 4a).On the other hand, the Ag(0.1)/CTO(NaCl,5)sample showed the highest CO selectivity among the three samples (Table 1, entry 3).This Ag(0.1)/CTO(NaCl,5) sample prepared by the flux method was higher than the Ag(0.1)/CTO(SS,1273) and Ag(0.1)/CTO(SS,1373) sample prepared by the solid state reaction method (Table 1, entries 10 and 11). Thus, the effect of the solute concentration was examined on the Ag(y)/CTO(NaCl, x) samples, which results were listed in Table 2, entries 3-5 for the Ag(0.1)/CTO(NaCl,x) samples and entries 6-10 for the Ag(0.5)/CTO(NaCl,x) samples.The CO production rate and CO selectivity were plotted in Fig. 6A.Both the CO production rates and the CO selectivity on both the Ag(0.1)/CTO(NaCl,x) samples and the Ag(0.5)/CTO(NaCl,x) samples presented each volcano plot upon the solute concentration, where the Ag(0.1)/CTO(NaCl,50)sample and the Ag(0.5)/CTO(NaCl,40)sample corresponded to the peaks of the volcano plots for the Ag(0.1)/CTO(NaCl,x) samples and the Ag(0.5)/CTO(NaCl,x) samples, respectively.The most active one in the present study was the Ag(0.5)/CTO(NaCl,40)sample, which exhibited the CO production rate of 0.35 mol h -1 and the selectivity for the CO 2 reduction was as high as 45 (Table 2 entry 7).It is noted that the CO production rates over these samples prepared by the flux method (Table 2, entries 4 and 7) were 10 times higher than that over the samples prepared by the solid state reaction method (Table 2, entries 11 and 12).The CO selectivity was also obviously higher for these samples prepared by the flux method than those by the solid state reaction method.Fig. 7 shows some representative FE-SEM images of these CTO samples before loading Ag cocatalyst.All the samples consisted of the polyhedral particles covered with many facets.The particle size observed in the images varied with the solute concentration and it is clear that the CTO(NaCl,40) sample had the larger polyhedral polycrystals than others.The average particle sizes of the polycrystals estimated from the SEM images for the CTO(NaCl,x) samples were plotted upon the solute concentration in Fig. 6B.It is interesting that the similar volcano plot appeared as Fig. 6A.Thus, the CO production rates were plotted versus the average size of the polycrystals as shown in Fig. 8.As clearly shown, the CO production rate and the average size of the polycrystals showed a good correlation.It is proposed that the larger polyhedral polycrystals loaded with Ag cocatalyst would be advantageous for the higher photocatalytic activity for the CO 2 reduction.As shown in Fig. 4d, the CTO(NaCl,40) sample would have less defects than the CTO(NaCl,5) sample.These results suggest that the large polyhedral polycrystals with the flat facets and with fewer defects would be suitable for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with water to produce CO. In order to elucidate the reason why the CO production rate decreased with time at the initial stage as shown in Fig. 5, the state of the Ag particles on the Ag(0.1)/CTO(NaCl,50)sample before and after the reaction test were examined.This photocatalyst also exhibited the constant activity for producing CO and H 2 after initial period for 5 h until 24 h later (not shown but similar to Fig. 5).In the DR UV-Visible spectra (Fig. 9a), the sample before use exhibited a broad band with the maximum at 470 nm in wavelength assignable to the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of the Ag nanoparticles.After the use in the photocatalytic reaction, the band maximum shifted to shorter wavelength around 420 nm (Fig. 9b), suggesting the variation of the state of the Ag nanoparticle, i.e., the particle size of the Ag nanoparticle would become slightly smaller.Fig. 10 shows the FE-SEM images recorded in a reflection mode, where the Ag particles could be observed as while dots (highlighted by the circles).On the Ag(0.1)/CTO(NaCl,50)sample, various size of Ag nanoparticles were scattered before the reaction (Fig. 10a), while the particles were located on some specific large and flat facets after the reaction test for 24 h (Fig. 10b).Generally, it is considered that the photoformed holes and electrons can oxidize and reduce both deposited nanoparticles and adsorbed molecules and ions on the photocatalyst surface.In the present study, since the Ag nanoparticles were deposited by the photodeposition method under air atmosphere and Ag might be photoreduced before adsorbed by the photocatalyst surface, the Ag nanoparticles might be partially oxidized or deposited even on the oxidative sites.This means that the metallic Ag atom in the Ag nanoparticles on the oxidative sites can be oxidized to Ag cation and released from the metallic particles while the released Ag cation can be reduced to form metallic Ag nanoparticles on the reductive sites.If the facets on the polyhedral polycrystals could be divided into oxidative and reductive facets, Ag nanoparticles on the oxidative facets would disappear and Ag nanoparticles on the reductive facets would be stabilized to function as the reductive sites for CO 2 reduction.On the CTO(NaCl,50) sample, several large polygonal facets on the polyhedral particles were observed in the SEM images (Fig. 10a andb).Before the reaction the Ag nanoparticles were dispersed on many facets.After the photocatalytic reaction, many Ag nanoparticles were found on some specific facets, where the Ag cocatalyst did not aggregate.This suggests that the Ag nanoparticles would be well stabilized on the large facets even after the photocatalytic reaction test.These facets would be the reductive facets.This dispersed and stabilized state of the Ag nanoparticles on the large and flat reductive facets would contribute to the constant and high photocatalytic activity in the steady state. On the other hand, the activity for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction of the Ag(0.1)/CTO(SS,1273)sample gradually decreased for 20 h while the activity for water splitting maintained (Table 2, entry 11).The CTO(SS,1273) sample consisted of roundish particles connected together, where no large facets were observed (Fig. 10c andd).Although the Ag nanoparticles were dispersed on the surface before the reaction test (Fig. 10c), they aggregated so much after the reaction test probably due to the lack of the large flat facets (Fig. 10d).Thus, it is proposed that the aggregation of the Ag cocatalyst would be the reason for the decrease of the photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction.These facts suggest that the CO 2 reduction to CO would take place on the Ag cocatalyst surface and the water splitting to produce H 2 would dominantly occur on the surface of the CaTiO 3 photocatalyst.The high and stable photocatalytic activity of the Ag/CaTiO 3 photocatalysts prepared with NaCl flux for CO 2 reduction would be achieved with the large flat facets stabilizing the Ag nanoparticles as the specific cocatalyst for CO formation.Although the positive effect of the large size of particles has been also reported and explained by the reduction of the recombination of the photoexcited electron and hole pairs, for example, for WO 3 photocatalyst 39, the reason for the size effect in the present study would be different from the reported case."}]}}
