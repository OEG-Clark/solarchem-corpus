the excitation source. 2.5.Photoactivity Test.The photocatalytic activity test for CO 2 reduction with H 2 O was conducted in a gas-phase photoreactor system with the catalyst uniformly distributed inside the reactor chamber.The reactor was equipped with a glass window at the top for passing light irradiation.The lamp was fixed at the top of the glass window, and a homemade parabolic reflector was placed above the reactor window for directing light irradiation into the cylindrical vessel.Before starting the experiments, CO 2 gas carrying moisture from the water saturator and regulated by a mass flow controller was streamed through the reactor for 30 min to saturate the catalyst surface with the reactants.In order to study the effect of catalyst loading, three different amounts of catalysts, i.e., 50, 150, and 250 mg, were used, whereas all the other parameters were kept constant during the catalyst loading optimization process.As the light intensity is very important in the photocatalysis process, the two different light intensities were investigated with the help of a 35 W CAR HID lamp and 300 W Xenon lamp with light intensities of 20 and 100 mW cm -2 , respectively.Furthermore, during all the experiments, no external heating or cooling was supplied to control reactor temperature and the reactor pressure was kept equal to atmospheric pressure.The gaseous products were analyzed using a gas chromatograph (GC-HP Technologies 6890 N) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a flame ionization detector (FID).The column employed was a

(Sigma-Aldrich, USA), melamine (Sigma-Aldrich, AR, purity 99), tungsten(VI) oxide (WO 3 , Acros, purity 99), and methanol (Merck, Reagent grade, Germany) were high-quality chemicals and were used as received. 2.2.Synthesis of the g-C 3 N 4 and Bt/g-C 3 N 4 Composite.In the first step, bulk graphitic carbon nitride (g-C 3 N 4 ) was fabricated using melamine powder as the precursor.Specifically, melamine (5 g), after placing in a ceramic crucible, was heated for 2 h at 550 C to get a sticky cake having a yellow color. 54The cake obtained was converted to fine powder by grinding with the help of a piston and mortal and after acid treatment, it was named as g-C 3 N 4 (CN).In the next step, the 2D pillared Bt coupled 2D g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction was synthesized through an ultrasonic-assisted impregnation approach.For this purpose, specific amounts of g-C 3 N 4 and Bt were dispersed in 20 mL of methanol through stirring and ultrasonic approach.Afterward, both the suspensions were mixed under continuous stirring and ultrasonicated for 60 min to get homogeneous texture.Finally, solids were separated through a centrifuge, and the sludge obtained was dried overnight in an oven at 100 C and named the Bt/ g-C 3 N 4 (BCN) composite. 2.3.Synthesis of WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 and WO 3 /Bt/g-C 3 N 4 Composites.For the synthesis of the WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composite, the ultrasonic approach was

For the synthesis of the WO 3 /Bt/g-C 3 N 4 composite, a similar approach was employed as discussed above.First, g-C 3 N 4 and Bt, dispersed in methanol, were mixed together and ultrasonicated for their uniform dispersion (sample A).In parallel, WO 3 was dispersed in methanol and stirred for uniform dispersion and named sample B. Afterward, sample B was added to sample A under continuous stirring.The suspension was ultrasonicated for developing good interaction and uniform dispersion of the materials.Finally, the suspension was centrifuged, oven-dried at 100 C, and named the WO 3 /Bt/g-C 3 N 4 (WBCN) composite.The schematic illustration for the synthesis of Bt/g-C 3 N 4 and WO 3 /Bt/g-C 3 N 4 is shown in Figure 1.

agent in a fixed bed and gas-phase photoreactor system.WO 3 / Bt/g-C 3 N 4 exhibits excellent photoactivity for both CO and CH 4 productions during the CO 2 photoreduction process under visible-light irradiation.The highest yields of CO and CH 4 of 37.4 and 118.9 mol h -1 were obtained using 150 mg of photocatalyst under 20 mW cm -2 light intensity.The amount of CH 4 production over the WO 3 /Bt/g-C 3 N 4 composite was 5.98-, 6.74-, and 25.19-fold higher than its production over WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 , Bt/g-C 3 N 4 , and g-C 3 N 4 samples, respectively.The production of CO and CH 4 over the WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composite varied by using different amounts of catalyst loading, providing information that interaction between light irradiation and catalyst is very important to maximize photocatalytic activity.The production rate of CH 4 was increased to 177.9 mol h -1 using 100 mW cm -2 light intensity under the same reaction conditions.A 1.49-fold improvement in performance of the WO 3 /Bt/g-C 3 N 4 composite was observed by increasing light intensity from 20 to 100 mW cm -2 due to more production of charge carriers over the composite photocatalyst surface.Highest QYs of 20.106 and 1.875 for CH 4 and CO were achieved over the WO 3 /Bt/g-C 3 N 4 composite with a selectivity of 72.82 for methane formation.In general, the significantly enhanced photocatalytic performance of the composite catalyst was due Energy Fuels to the formation of the direct Z-scheme system with higher redox potential for photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 to CO and CH 4 under visible-light irradiation.The stability analysis further confirms continuous fuel formation over entire irradiation time and employing multiple cycles without any decrement in productivity.The findings of the present work are expected to be utilized for constructing the Z-scheme heterojunction system without using noble metals with controlled morphology for tailoring photoinduced CO 2 reduction to fuels and which would also be helpful for other solar fuel application.

The Raman spectra of the samples were acquired to identify their structure characteristics, as demonstrated in Figure 2b.For pristine WO 3 , the characteristic bands appeared at 131.57, 271.65, 716.76, and 806.68 cm -1 .The Raman peak at 271.65 cm -1 belongs to the bending vibration mode of W-O, whereas peaks at 716.76 and 806.68 cm -1 present the stretching vibration mode of O-W-O bands, which is similar to the literature. 34,57Similarly, all the Raman peaks of g-C 3 N 4 belong to the polymeric structure of graphitic carbon nitride.It is noticeable that there is a slight shift in Raman peaks for the BCN, WCN, and WBCN samples.The shifts in Raman peaks confirm their good interaction to develop heterojunction composites.Previously, a CdS/WO 3 /WS 2 composite has been reported with shifts in Raman peaks due to good interaction among the materials. 57This indicates that the WBCN composite was successfully constructed, which is beneficial to transport charge carriers for stimulating the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction process. The structures and morphologies of g-C 3 N 4 , WO 3 , Bt-loaded g-C 3 N 4 , and WO 3 /Bt/g-C 3 N 4 composite samples were further examined using FESEM measurement.Figure 3a shows g-C 3 N 4 layers with uniform size and shape.Figure 3b shows the cubic structure of WO 3 with uniform size and shape, whereas Figure 3c further confirms the orthorhombic crystal structure of WO 3 , which would be beneficial for providing larger external active surface area.The bentonite micrograph reveals an obvious 2D layer structure as presented in Figure 3d.The Bt has a typical layered structure with irregular curves, and all the layers are compact together and similarly reported in the literature. 49fter coupling Bt with g-C 3 N 4 through the pillaring process, Bt layers become thinner, apart from each other, and are pillared with g-C 3 N 4 as demonstrated in Figure 3e,f.Obviously, 2D Bt layers are effectively pillared with 2D g-C 3 N 4 layers for constructing the 2D/2D heterojunction.More importantly, the surface became porous and rough, which provides a good interfacial interaction among the layered structures; thus, it confirms successful completion of the pillared process. 45This would be beneficial for efficient separation and transportation of photoinduced electrons and holes during the photocatalysis process.Figure 3g-i presents the morphology of the WO 3 /Bt/ g-C 3 N 4 composite.Evidently, WO 3 has been uniformly dispersed over the 2D/2D Bt/g-C 3 N 4 composite, indicating a good interaction among the three components of the composite.Thus, the WO 3 /Bt/g-C 3 N 4 composite was successfully synthesized through a facile ultrasonication method and will be promising for stimulating optical and photocatalytic characteristics. The element distribution over the WO 3 /Bt/g-C 3 N 4 surface was further investigated through EDX mapping analysis, as displayed in Figure 4. Figure 4a shows the SEM image of the WO 3 /Bt/g-C 3 N 4 composite, whereas elemental mapping images are shown in Figure 4b.Obviously, all the elements of the composite are uniformly distributed in the composite sample.A further distribution of elements corresponding to W, C, Si, Al, N, and O could be seen from their uniform surface color as presented in Figure 4c. Figure 4d further confirms the presence of all these elements.All these results confirm the existence of the WBCN composite catalyst elements with good distribution. The micrography of the composite samples was further investigated with TEM to investigate the structure and morphology, and the results are described in Figure 5. Figure 5a shows the cubic structure of WO 3 as similarly observed by SEM analysis.Figure 5b-d Energy Fuels composites with lattice fringes of 0.386, 0.322, and 0.303 nm for WO 3 , g-C 3 N 4 , and Bt, respectively. 37Thus, based on the above results, the WBCN heterojunction has been successfully established, which would be beneficial for proficient absorption of light irradiation and charge carrier separation. To further understand the chemical states of elements in the WBCN composite, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) Energy Fuels analysis was conducted.Figure 6 shows high-resolution XPS results of W, O, C, N, Si, and Al elements.Figure 6a presents the XPS spectrum of W 4f with two major peaks having 36.7 and 38.5 eV binding energies for 4f 7 /2 and 4f 5 /2 , respectively, assigned to W 6 ions and which confirms the presence of WO 3 , the same as in a previous report. 58 Similarly, a peak at 406.3 eV can be assigned to surface modification of carbon nitride. 37Figure 6d exhibits four peaks with binding energies of 530.1, 532.0, 533.5, and 535.3 eV.The peak at 530.1 eV can be attributed to the lattice oxygen of WO 3 ; however, the two peaks at 532.0 and 533.5 eV can be assigned to surface oxygen vacancies and oxygen atoms in the composite, respectively.The two other peaks with binding energies at 535.3 and 539.7 eV are attributed to the hydroxyl group (-OH). 29Figure 6e,f shows the XPS spectra for Si 2p and Al 2p with binding energies of 104.6 and 76.6 eV, attributed to the presence of Si and Al in the bentonite samples, respectively. The optical properties of WO 3 , Bt, g-C 3 N 4 , and their binary/ ternary composite heterostructures were conducted through UV-visible DRS, as displayed in Figure 7a.The absorption edges of pristine WO 3 and pure g-C 3 N 4 are estimated at around 450 nm, confirming their visible-light absorption.Bentonite has a wide range of light absorption in both UV and visible regions; however, higher light absorption is observed in the UV region.Furthermore, when Bt was pillared with g-C 3 N 4 , there was no significant effect on the change in the visible-light absorption edge, attributed to the typical light absorption of Bt derived from their layered structure characteristics.Similarly, coupling WO 3 with g-C 3 N 4 did not alter the band edge of visible-light absorption due to the same visible-light absorption characteristics of both the materials.After construction of the ternary WO 3 /Bt/g-C 3 N 4 composite, the light absorption edge was somewhat shifted toward the UV region, probably due to UV-visible-light absorption characteristics of Bt in the composite.Previously, similar results have been reported while investigating a Mt-loaded g-C 3 N 4 /TiO 2 composite for photocatalytic hydrogen production. 47Furthermore, the band gap energy of photocatalysts is calculated using the Tauc equation as demonstrated in eq 1. A hv E ( ) ( ) where hv, , A, and E g are the photon energy, absorption coefficient, absorption constant, and optical energy band gap, respectively.The band gap energies were calculated from the plot of (ahv) 2 versus photon energy (hv) as demonstrated in Figure 7b.The band gap energies were estimated to be 2.74, 2.85, 2.90, 2.93, and 2.95 eV for the WO 3 , g-C 3 N 4 , Bt/g-C 3 N 4 , WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 , and WO 3 /Bt/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalysts, respectively.It is obvious that visible-light absorption edges of pristine WO 3 and g-C 3 N 4 were not much affected with Bt loading.In the literature, band gap energies of 2.70 for g-C 3 N 4 and 2.60 eV for WO 3 have been reported.However, an increase in band gap energy of WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 was observed, which can be attributed to the presence of defect states of g-C 3 N 4 due to the incorporation of WO 3 . 29Similarly, a band gap energy of 2.70 eV for WO 3 has been reported. 33In another work, band gap energies of 2.80 and 2.87 eV were obtained for the WO 3 and RGO/WO 3 samples, respectively. 58All these Energy Fuels findings confirm the results of current work, whereas WO 3 coupled with g-C 3 N 4 would be beneficial to construct the Zscheme heterojunction system for efficient photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to fuels.The photoluminescence (PL) characterization was further conducted to determine charge carrier separation trends of the samples.Figure 7c divulges the relationship of PL intensities of pristine g-C 3 N 4 , WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 , and Bt-mediated WBCN photocatalyst samples.The PL spectra were obtained at an excitation wavelength of 325 nm, and a broader peak in the range of 400 to 600 nm for all the samples was observed; however, peak intensity varied according to pure, binary, and ternary composite samples.The PL spectrum of pure g-C 3 N 4 shows the highest emission intensity, noticeably due to immediate recombination of electron and holes.The PL intensity of g-C 3 N 4 clearly declined after coupling with WO 3 due to faster charge carrier separation among the semiconductors.Comparatively, a lower charge carrier recombination rate was observed over Bt/g-C 3 N 4 , as evidenced by lower PL emission intensity, due to 2D/2D heterojunction development with superior charge carrier transportation.In the literature, lowered PL intensity over the CNTs/TiO 2 /MMT composite due to the prevented recombination rate by layered clay has been reported. 48Likewise, the PL intensity of g-C 3 N 4 / TiO 2 was significantly reduced by introducing 2D layered Mt clay because of faster charge carrier separation. 54Thus, layered clay materials are efficient for trapping and transporting charge carriers in the semiconductors due to the presence of transition-metal ions in their galleries. Moreover, constructing a WBCN ternary heterojunction, the PL intensity was significantly reduced.This can be attributed to the suppressed recombination of photoinduced charge carriers with their superior separation corresponding to heterojunction formation with Bt as the moderator and electron sink.Previously, lower PL emission intensity within the Z-scheme WO 3 -TiO 2 /Cu 2 ZnSnS 4 ternary nanocomposite due to proficient interfacial charge carrier separation has been reported. 33In another development, a decreased in PL intensity of g-C 3 N 4 with WO 3 has been reported because of a hindered charge carrier recombination rate. 55In the literature, reduced PL intensity with the Pd-Au-loaded TiO 2 -WO 3 composite compared to TiO 2 has been reported. 59imilarly, lower PL intensity was observed by introducing WO 3 into g-C 3 N 4 through the direct Z-scheme heterojunction. 29hus, a successful fabrication of the ternary WBCN heterojunction would be beneficial for proficient charge carrier separation with enhanced photocatalytic activity. Furthermore, band positions of WO 3 and g-C 3 N 4 are very important to understand the direction of charge transfer in the WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composite.The valence band (E VB ) and conduction band (E CB ) edge positions of g-C 3 N 4 and WO 3 were calculated using the well-known empirical equations as illustrated in eqs 2 and 3 60 where E VB is the valence band edge, E CB is the conduction band edge, E bg is the band gap energy of a semiconductor, E e is the energy of the free electron of hydrogen scale, and is the geometric mean of Mullikan electronegativity.The summary of band positions for g-C 3 N 4 and WO 3 has been demonstrated in Table 1.Using eq 2, CB values for WO 3 and g-C 3 N 4 were calculated to be 0.705 and -1.22 eV, respectively.Similarly, using eq 3, VB values of 3.47 and 1.67 eV for WO 3 and g-C 3 N 4 , respectively, were obtained.Previously, -1.12 and 1.48 eV CB and VB values for pristine g-C 3 N 4 , respectively, were obtained. 61Similarly, Shi and co-workers synthesized WO 3 nanosheets and reported an E bg of 2.75 eV and CB/VB values of 0.15/2.90eV (vs NHE), respectively. 32In another development, VBs of 1.585 and 3.275 eV for g-C 3 N 4 and WO 3 , respectively, while CBs of -1.125 and 0.905 eV for g-C 3 N 4 and WO 3 , respectively, have been reported. 56Thus, the band positions in the current work are in good agreement with the reported values in the literature.It is obvious that the CB of g-C 3 N 4 (-1.22 eV) is more negative than the CB of WO 3 (0.705);however, the CB of WO 3 is not suitable for reduction of CO 2 due to the thermodynamic barrier.Thus, the Z-scheme of WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 with Bt as the solid electron moderator would be beneficial for transforming electrons from the CB of WO 3 to VB of g-C 3 N 4 during the photocatalysis process under visible-light irradiation.Thus, a good band structure of WO 3 and g-C 3 N 4 would be possible to maximize photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to produce CO, CH 4 , CH 3 OH, and other hydrocarbons. Reduction with H 2 O.The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction behaviors of CN, BCN, WCN, and WBCN were studied in a closed fixed bed photoreactor, in which a mixture of CO 2 /H 2 O was filled and reaction was conducted under visible-light irradiation.Prior to starting the photocatalytic activity test, quality control experiments were conducted under different conditions to confirm that the products were obtained during the photoinduced CO 2 reduction process only.Initially, blank experiments were conducted using light irradiation and photocatalyst without injecting a feed mixture of CO 2 /H 2 O, and in the second case, experiments were conducted using a feed mixture without the photocatalyst but under light irradiation.In both sets of experiments, in the absence of the feed mixture or photocatalysts, carbon-based products were not detected in the reaction system under visible-light irradiation.This confirms that CO 2 reduction only occurs under an appropriate environment and any products (CO and CH 4 ) were only produced during photocatalytic reaction of CO 2 with H 2 O in the presence of the photocatalyst under light irradiation. 3.2.1.Effect of Bt and WO 3 Loading.The photocatalytic performances of CN, WCN, BCN, and WBCN photocatalysts were determined through CO 2 reduction with water as the reducing agent under visible-light irradiation.CO and CH 4 were the main CO 2 photoreduction products in all the experiments, and their yield rates over irradiation time are demonstrated in Figure 8.It can be seen that, for the CN, WCN, and BCN samples, CO as the main product was observed accompanied with a smaller amount of methane formation.CO and CH 4 production rates of 73.34 and 31.33 mol g -1 h -1 over g-C 3 N 4 were obtained, which are apparently lower than their production using composite samples.The lower photocatalytic activity in pristine g-C 3 N 4 can be ascribed to lower surface area and higher recombination rate of photoinduced charge carriers (e -/h ).When WO 3 was coupled with CN to construct the WCN heterojunction, CO and CH 4 evolution rates of 144 and 132 mol g -1 h -1 , respectively, were obtained.The WCN performances for CO and CH 4 production were 1.91-and 4.21-fold higher than that using pristine CN, respectively.The WCN performance enhancement may be caused by excellent charge separation due to the Z-scheme heterojunction with promising redox potential for efficient conversion of CO 2 to fuels. 37Previously, a Pd-Au/TiO 2 -WO 3 composite was tested, and higher efficiency and productivity for enhanced production of CO via CO 2 reduction under visible light were found. 59All these findings confirm WO 3 -assisted g-C 3 N 4 to be a promising composite photocatalyst for stimulating photoinduced CO 2 reduction for the production of CO under visible-light irradiation.Furthermore, the bentonite pillared g-C 3 N 4 composite showed good performance during photocatalytic production of CO and methane with yield rates of 232.67 and 117.33 mol g -1 h -1 , respectively.The production of CO was 3.09fold high, while CH 4 production was 3.75 times more over the BCN composite than over pristine g-C 3 N 4 .This significantly improved activity of BCN was evidently due to pillared clay heterojunction formation with the 2D structure, enabling superior charge separation.Obviously, with the help of the WCN composite, CH 4 production was increased; however, BCN promoted CO 2 reduction to produce CO while employing a similar reaction environment.This was probably due to utilization of the more negative CB position of CN and more positive VB position of WO 3 due to constructing the Zscheme heterojunction.Due to utilizing the VB of WO 3 , there would be an efficient oxidation process for hydrogen production, which was effectively utilized for CO and CH 4 production. The performance of the Bt coupled WCN heterojunction has been further investigated, and results are demonstrated in Figure 8.The WBCN photocatalytic activity for CO 2 conversion was obviously enhanced, and yields of CO and CH 4 of 249.34 and 792.67 mol g -1 h -1 were detected after 2 h irradiation time.This amount of CO production was 1.07-, 1.73-, and 3.31-fold higher than it was produced over BCN, WCN, and CN samples, respectively.Similarly, the effect of methane formation over the WBCN composite was 6.01, 6.76, and 25.30 times higher than it was produced over WCN, BCN, and CN samples, respectively.It shows enhanced photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with selective production of methane over the WBCN composite, indicating that it is much beneficial to construct the Z-scheme heterojunction in the presence of the Bt moderator with proficient transportation of charge carriers among them. 34Generally, two and eight electrons are utilized in producing 1 mol of carbon dioxide and 1 mol of methane production while utilizing 2 mol of CO 2 under visible light.The higher CH 4 formation confirms proficient generation and mobility of electrons over the pillared heterojunction being utilized by CO 2 for its reduction to CH 4 and is similar to the literature. 62All these findings confirm that Bt is efficient for the separation of charge carriers, whereas WCN is a good Z-scheme heterojunction for stimulating the CO 2 reduction process with selective visiblelight production of methane. The performances of pristine CN, BCN, and WBCN photocatalysts were further investigated under visible-light irradiation of intensity 20 mW cm -2 and catalyst loading 150 mg at different irradiation times.Figure 8a shows continuous production of CO, whereas production of CH 4 with time is depicted in Figure 8b.Evidently, both CO and CH 4 continuously evolved with time on stream, which demonstrates a highly stable composite photocatalyst and cannot lost photoactivity with time.The CO and CH 4 production rates are lower over CN, which were significantly enhanced after introducing WO 3 and Bt, and production was continuous with time.Using BCN, continuous CH 4 production was observed compared to the WCN photocatalyst.Similarly, using the WBCN composite, both CO and CH 4 continuously evolved over time on stream.Using WBCN, CH 4 and CO production reached 1585.33 and 498.67 mol g -1 after 2 h irradiation time.It demonstrates that coupling WO 3 with CN is helpful to transfer electrons from WO 3 to g-C 3 N 4 , through Z-scheme interfacial interaction, and thus promotes separation of charge carriers. 63Introducing Bt not only enhanced photocatalytic activity but also contributed to selective photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to CH 4 .It is observed that higher CH 4 selectivity was achieved over the WBCN composite, and the order is as follows: WBCN (76.07) WCN (36.66) BCN (32.52) CN (29.38).Comparatively, selective CO 2 reduction to CO over the Pd-Au/TiO 2 -WO 3 composite under visible light has been reported in the literature; 59 however, Ni/bentonite catalysts were found to be very efficient for CO 2 methanation. 52n the current development, several reports are available on the use of WO 3 and g-C 3 N 4 for the conversion of CO 2 to CO, CH 4 and H 2 .In this perspective, the Au-doped WO 3 /TiO 2 composite with enhanced H 2 evolution, 36 enhanced methane formation over 3D/2D Cu 2 O octahedrons/WO 4 nanoflake during CO 2 reduction with water, 31 enhanced CO 2 reduction to CO and CH 4 over the Z-scheme WO 3 -TiO 2 /Cu 2 ZnSnS 4 nanocomposite, 33 higher conversion of CO 2 with CO production over Cu 2 O decorated WO 3 nanosheets, 32 and WO 3 dispersed g-C 3 N 4 with enhanced CO and CH 4 production during the photoinduced CO 2 reduction process 37 were observed.Similarly, several reports present enhanced photocatalytic CO 2 reduction efficiency over natural-claymodified composite samples.In the current development, enhanced H 2 production over the Mt-loaded g-C 3 N 4 /TiO 2 composite, 54 Mt-dispersed Au/TiO 2 with selective CO 2 reduction to CO, 64 enhanced production of CO and CH 4 during CO 2 reduction over the Pd-Au/TiO 2 -WO 3 composite photocatalyst, 59 monolithic Pd-loaded g-C 3 N 4 /RGO composite with significantly enhanced CO 2 reduction to methane, 11 and Mt-loaded g-C 3 N 4 with enhanced CO 2 reduction by H 2 to CH 4 46 have been reported.All these findings confirm that WBCN has high photoactivity and stability for continuous production of hydrocarbon fuels during visible-light-driven CO 2 reduction. 3.2.2.Effect of Catalyst Loading and Mass Transfer Limitations.Photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 is a surfacedependent chemical reaction and occurs by consuming electrons (e -) and holes (h ), which are produced over the photocatalyst surface with the involvement of light irradiation.This further demonstrates that there would be a good interaction between the three components of the photocatalytic reaction system (light, catalyst-exposed surface area, and reactants) to attain highest photocatalyst performance.Therefore, the efficiency of the WBCN composite photocatalyst was further explored under different amounts of catalyst loadings during CO 2 reduction with water at different times, and results are demonstrated in Figure 9. Figure 9a shows the production of CO, whereas highest production was observed with 150 mg catalyst loading, which gradually declined when loading amounts were increased to 250 mg.However, continuous CO production over irradiation time was observed, and production trends were consistent under all three loading amounts.The decrease in CO production with higher catalyst loading can be explained based on the following: (a) the catalyst surface was not fully utilized due to employing a fixed bed reactor, and only the upper surface of the catalyst was photoactivated for the generation of charge carriers, resulting in declined photocatalytic per unit mass of catalyst surface available; and (b) some amount of CO produced would be converted to methane through CO methanation due to higher efficiency of the composite catalyst for generating electrons.Thus, declined CO productivity with a higher amount of catalyst loading would be due to less utilization of the available catalyst surface and conversion of CO to CH 4 over the electron/hole-rich catalyst surface. Figure 9b presents the effect of catalyst loading for stimulating methane formation under visible-light irradiation.Using a small amount of catalyst loading (50 mg), CH 4 production was lower, which is obviously increased when the catalyst loading amount was increased to 150 mg.This increase in WBCN photoactivity for methane production was evidently due to more available catalyst surface area for the conversion of CO 2 /CO to methane.With the increase in catalyst loading, there would be more surface area available for more CO 2 uptake and capture of light irradiation, resulting in enhanced photocatalytic activity.For the conversion of CO 2 to CH 4 , eight electrons are required; however, CO can be converted to methane through CO methanation using six electrons.Thus, enhanced CH 4 production over the WBCN composite with higher loading would enable higher CO 2 adsorption with efficient production of charge carriers for methane formation through CO 2 /CO methanation with the involvement of eight/ six electrons.As expected, when catalyst loading was increased to 150 mg, CH 4 production declined and evolution rates were steady with time on stream.Any excessive loading may cause lower catalyst surface area exposed to light irradiation, resulting in declined photoactivity. Comparatively, trends for CO and CH 4 are different with various amounts of catalyst loading.This can be explained based on sorption competitions, higher light absorption, and multiple reactions for CO 2 conversion to CH 4 .With lower catalyst loading, only a small amount of CO 2 adsorption occurs with a lower amount of charge carrier production, resulting in production of both CO and CH 4 .However, when catalyst loading was increased, larger surface area would be available for CO 2 uptake for its conversion to CO.However, due to excessive availability of electrons, produced CO has potential for CH 4 formation through the methanation process with the involvement of six electrons.Any excessive loading (250 mg) resulted in declined production of both CO and CH 4 due to unexposed catalyst surface area for utilizing light irradiation and similarly reported in the literature. 65All these results demonstrate that catalyst loading not only enhances photoactivity but also has an impact on product selectivity during the CO 2 reduction process. Figure 10 shows the schematic illustrations for the mass transfer of CO 2 and H 2 O with external and internal mass transfer diffusion limitations in the presence of visible-light irradiation.Figure 10a shows the schematic illustration of different amounts of catalyst loading with reactants attached to the catalyst surface.Using a small amount of catalyst loading (50 mg), the reactor surface was not entirely covered with the catalyst, and thus, photon flux was not effectively consumed during the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction process.Using 150 mg of catalyst surface, higher adsorption of reactants (CO 2 , H 2 O) would be achieved due to a larger exposed catalyst surface to reactants and light absorption.Due to the higher sorption process with more photon flux utilization, the CO 2 reduction process was significantly enhanced with selective CO and methane formation under visible-light irradiation.Comparatively, with excessive loading of the catalyst (250 mg), bed height was increased; however, the catalyst surface exposed to reactants and light irradiation was decreased, resulting in lower production of CO and CH 4 per unit mass of catalyst employed.This was evidently because all the photocatalysts loaded inside the reactor was not fully consumed, resulting in declined productivity. All these findings are further discussed based on mass transfer and external/internal diffusions as illustrated in Figure 10d.In the thermal process of CO 2 reduction, the rate of reaction is dependent on seven steps, which include external diffusion, internal diffusion, adsorption of reactants, and surface reactions.In photocatalysis, the reaction rate is dependent on the catalyst surface exposed to reactants and light irradiation and is independent of internal diffusion of reactants inside the pores and channels.Thus, the performance of the photocatalyst is dependent on reactants attached to the catalyst external surface and light irradiation absorption over the catalyst surface.With increasing catalyst loading, the catalyst surface exposed to light irradiation would be reduced; however, internal mass transfer would be proficient, which would not be beneficial for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction process.Comparatively, using a very small amount of catalyst loading, external mass transfer would be very efficient; however, adsorption of reactants will be the rate-limiting steps.Similarly, the rate-limiting step is dependent on the consumption of photon flux entering into the reactor, which is indirectly dependent on the efficiency of light absorption and production of photoinduced electrons and holes over the catalyst surface.In addition, charge carrier separation and its transportation toward the catalyst surface for dynamic CO 2 conversion and water splitting also influence the rate of reaction.Using the WBCN composite with optimized catalyst loading, there would be more external mass transfer and surface adsorption of reactants with photon flux utilization and proficient charge carrier separation, resulting in significantly enhanced CO and methane formation. 3.2.3.Effect of the Reducing Agent.The performance of the WO 3 /Bt/g-C 3 N 4 composite for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was further investigated under different reducing agents.The reducing agents employed were pure water, mixture of 10 acetic acid-water solution, and 10 methanol-water solution.For this purpose, CO 2 gas was regulated to pass through these solutions to carry either water-methanol or water-acetic acid vapors before entering into the photoreactor.Besides, controlled experiments were also conducted without using CO 2 in the feed mixture but using only nitrogen to carry water-methanol vapors into the photoreactor.The photocatalytic production of CO and CH 4 during CO 2 reduction with different types of feed mixtures is demonstrated in Figure 11.Using only water vapors with nitrogen, production of CH 4 or CO was not detected.Similarly, using nitrogen with 10 methanol-water vapors, a smaller amount of CO was produced with trace amounts of CH 4 production. On the other hand, when acetic acid and methanol were added to water, production of CO and CH 4 was increased.However, the highest photoactivity of the WBCN composite was obtained when CO 2 reduction was conducted with water vapors only.This was obviously due to the activation of reforming reaction of acetic acid and methanol for CO 2 and hydrogen production, instead of CO 2 reduction to CO and CH 4 .Thus, production of CO during water-methanol vapors without CO 2 in the feed mixture would be due to the following: first, CO 2 would be produced during methanol steam reforming, which was finally converted to CO with the involvement of hydrogen during the photocatalysis process.Recently, we have investigated photocatalytic water splitting with methanol as the reducing agent and observed the production of CO 2 in addition of hydrogen. 66This confirms that methanol was not favorable for CH 4 production, and similarly, the photocatalyst was cleaned, and any carboncontaining products were produced during CO 2 reduction under light irradiation. 3.2.4.Effect of Light Intensity and Thermodynamic Analysis.Since photoinduced CO 2 reduction is an endothermic reaction, which is not possible to occur naturally under standard reaction conditions.To break the thermodynamic endothermic barrier of chemical reaction, the input energy can be provided through heat, electricity, or light source (UV-or visible-light irradiation).The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction can be conducted in standard conditions with the use of light energy, but the extent of photocatalytic reaction is entirely dependent on the amounts of photogenerated charge carriers and their effective utilization.Therefore, the performance of the WBCN composite photocatalyst was further investigated at different light intensities (20 and 100 mW cm -2 ) as demonstrated in Figure 12a,b.Evidently, CO and CH 4 productions were increased by varying the light intensity, and trends were steady with time on stream.The productions of CO and CH 4 were increased by 1.77-and 1.49-fold by varying the light intensity from 20 to 100 mW cm -2 , respectively.The increase in photocatalytic activity with higher light intensity was obviously due to promoting photoinduced electrons and holes for stimulating photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 and water oxidation process over the WBCN composite photocatalyst.Comparatively, light intensity was increased by 5-fold (20 to 100 mW cm -2 ), but photoactivity was enhanced only by 1.5-to-2.12fold for CH 4 and CO production, respectively.This demonstrates that all the light irradiation was not fully utilized by the photocatalyst during the CO 2 reduction process.This would be possibly because not all the catalysts exposed to the catalyst surface and the light absorption were not efficient due to using a fixed bed photoreactor system and similarly reported in the literature. 61ll these findings confirm that light intensity is beneficial for enhancing photocatalytic performance; however, full utilization of light intensity depends on catalyst surface area exposed to light irradiation, which is directly dependent on the design of the photoreactor system. The schematic illustration of thermodynamic aspects for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to CO and CH 4 is demonstrated in Figure 12c.As discussed above, the rate of photocatalytic reaction is dependent on the production of electrons and holes, which has a direct relation with the photon flux utilization.When light strikes over the catalyst surface, it is consumed for the generation of charge carriers, enabling CO 2 reduction and water oxidation processes.A 818 kJ mol -1 minimum energy is required to cross the energy barrier among the reactants (CO 2 ) and products (CH 4 ) during CO 2 reduction to CH 4 . 67n addition, conversion of CO 2 to produce CO and methane cannot be possible if the water oxidation process is not efficient.This is because both electrons and protons are required for CO and methane production during the CO 2 reduction process.Previously, it was reported that more energy is required for water splitting to produce hydrogen compared to CO 2 reduction for CO and methane formation.In general, thermodynamic states consist of the lowest energy state (S1), highest energy to cross the energy barrier (S2), and energy state of products (S3).In the first stage, 1.23 eV (237 kJ mol -1 ) energy is consumed for hydrogen production, whereas in the second stage, -0.24 V (-113 kJ mol -1 ) energy is involved during the CO 2 methanation process. 60Thus, the energy barrier for the conversion of CO 2 to CO and methane can be reduced by increasing input energy, enabling enhanced methane formation through CO 2 and CO methanation. 3.2.5.Quantum Yield Calculation and Performance Analysis.The performance of a photocatalyst can be estimated based on the production rate and comparing the amounts of products obtained under specific reaction conditions.It is well established that photocatalyst productivity is dependent on several parameters such as the amount of catalyst loading, light intensity, feed mixture, and type of photoreactor.During the performance comparison of one specific photocatalytic system with others, all these parameters should be systematically compared, instead of comparing only the production rate.Therefore, quantum yield (QY) is an ideal way to compare the photocatalyst performance of carbon monoxide or methane formation during the CO 2 reduction process.The QY provides information about the amount of photon energy consumed for the production of electrons and their consumption during the CO 2 reduction process.The QYs for CO and CH 4 can be calculated using production rate with photon flux rate according to eqs 4-6.where P, , h, and c are the incident light intensity, wavelength of light, Planck's constant, and velocity of light, respectively.An incident area of 28 cm 2 , light powers of 20 and 100 mW cm -2 , and wavelength of 420 nm were employed during QY calculation.As two and eight electrons are consumed for CO and CH 4 production, their values have been used during QY calculation.The production rate has been calculated based on 2 h irradiation time. The production rate, selectivity, and QY of the CO/CH 4 obtained during CO 2 reduction with the H 2 O reducing agent over pristine g-C 3 N 4 , BCN, WCN, and WBCN are summarized in Table 2.It could be seen from Table 2 that QY is another important benchmark in evaluating the performance of photocatalysts in different photocatalytic reaction systems in addition to generation of CO and CH 4 during the CO 2 reduction process.The QY for CO and methane production was entirely dependent on the amount of catalyst loading and light intensity employed.A QY of 13.43 was achieved for CH 4 production over the WBCN sample under 20 mW cm -2 light intensity (150 mg catalyst loading), which is 5.98, 6.74, and 25.19 times more than it was achieved with WCN, BCN, and CN samples, respectively.Similarly, CO QYs over WBCN of 1.07-, 1.72-, and 3.31-fold higher were achieved than using BCN, WCN, and g-C 3 N 4 , respectively.The highest QY of 20.106 was achieved for CH 4 production over the WBCN composite with a light intensity of 100 mW cm -2 , which is 1.497 times higher than CH 4 when produced with 20 mW cm -2 light intensity.It could be seen that light intensity was increased by 5-fold (20 to 100 mW cm -2 ); however, QY was slightly increased.This demonstrates that photocatalytic efficiency can be enhanced by increasing light intensity; however, light absorption depends on the capacity and design of a photoreactor.All these findings confirm that performance analysis of photocatalysts with the help of QY provides important information and would be beneficial for selecting the appropriate photocatalytic system with a structured photocatalyst for stimulating photocatalytic CO 2 conversion to fuels. 3.3.Stability Investigation in Cycles with Spent Catalyst Characterization.In addition to having a good photocatalytic efficiency of photocatalysts, stability and reusability are also key factors in measuring the quality of photocatalysts.The photocatalyst recyclability analysis was conducted to assess the photostability of the WBCN composite catalyst up to three consecutive cycles.For this purpose, all the parameters were kept constant, and after completing every cycle, nitrogen gas was used to remove the products from the reactor before executing next cycle.As shown in Figure 13a, continuous productions of CO and methane were obtained over irradiation times and in all the three cycles.This demonstrates remarkable performance of the WBCN composite for CO 2 reduction with H 2 O to CO and CH 4 .More importantly, the production of CH 4 was slightly increased in the second cyclic runs, whereas there was continuous CH 4 production in the third cyclic run.This could be explained based on the reducibility of composite catalyst with more surface area exposed to light irradiation, resulting in proficient charge carrier generation for methane formation. Previously, stability analysis of Z-scheme WO 3 -TiO 2 / Cu 2 ZnSnS 4 was conducted for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, and declined photocatalytic activity after every cycle was reported. 33In another work, high stability of iron phthalocyanine/porous WO 3 nanocomposites during photocatalytic CO and methane evolution during CO 2 reduction with H 2 O in multiple cycles has been reported. 34Using Mo-doped WO 3 0.33H 2 O, enhanced photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to methane was observed; however, the catalyst lost stability after every cycle. 62Similarly, Cu 2 O-decorated WO 3 nanosheets were found to be promising for stimulating photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, but photoactivity was significantly dropped over the number of cycles. 32Recently, molybdenum-modified Cs 0.33 WO 3 nanorods have been reported with significantly enhanced photoactivity for CO 2 reduction to CO and CH 3 OH.Stability up to four cycles with continuous CO and CH 3 OH production was observed. 69In the current work, high stability of the WO 3 /Bt/g-C 3 N 4 composite observed due to the presence of clay minerals with its good dispersion. Figure 13b shows fresh and spent photocatalyst samples investigated using Raman analysis.Evidently, all the peaks of the spent WBCN sample have the same position as they appeared in the fresh WBCN composite photocatalyst.This reveals no distortion in the interaction of the WBCN composite; besides, additional peaks related to impurities were also not detected.Furthermore, surface images of fresh and spent WBCN have the same appearance, which further confirms the high stability and interaction of the components in the composite, as shown in Figure 13c,d.It is apparent that there is no significant difference in the surface properties and structures of the fresh and spent composite samples, indicating that the composite has good structural stability and similarly reported previously. 69All these findings confirm remarkable durability of the WO 3 /Bt/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst, making it a promising candidate to be utilized in the field of sustainable energy conversion and other solar energy applications.3.4.Photocatalytic Reaction Mechanism.The reaction mechanism is entirely dependent on the band gap of individual semiconductors, band positions, and type of light irradiation employed.Under visible-light irradiation, electrons and holes are produced over WO 3 owing to the narrow band gap energy.Since the CB of g-C 3 N 4 is more negative than the CB of WO 3 , photogenerated electrons are transferred from the WO 3 conduction band to the g-C 3 N 4 VB for its activation and promoting the photoinduced charge carrier separation.At the same time, due to the presence of Bt among the heterojunction, it extracts electrons from the CB of WO 3 and transfers toward the VB of g-C 3 N 4 , also working as a cocatalyst for promoting charge carrier separation.The reactions in eqs 7-9 illustrate the production of electrons and their separation in the WO 3 /Bt/g-C 3 N 4 composite.The WO 3 hole reacts with the adsorbed water molecules and oxidizes to produce the hydrogen ion (H ) and hydroxyl radicals (OH) according to eq 10, resulting in the formation of hydrogen radicals (eq 11).The electrons are further consumed during CO 2 reduction to its intermediates (CO 2 -) as presented in eq 12.The interaction between hydrogen radical and CO 2 -enables CO production as illustrated in eq 13.Similarly, electrons and protons are further reacted for CO methanation as illustrated in eq 14.Therefore, efficient generation and separation of charge carriers over the composite catalyst are in high demand to maximize photocatalytic activity during the CO 2 reduction process. WO (e ) Bt WO Bt(e ) 3 mediator 3 Bt (e ) g C N Bt g C N (e ) Based on the experimental results, a possible mechanism for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O over the Bt-mediated WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 is illustrated in Figure 14.Using the pristine g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst, lower yield rates of CO and CH 4 were detected due to faster recombination of charge carriers as demonstrated in Figure 14a.Due to the absence of the cocatalyst, electrons are traveling a long distance to reach the outer surface of the catalyst, resulting in their surface and volume recombination.However, when Bt clay was pillared with g-C 3 N 4 , a 2D/2D heterojunction of Bt/g-C 3 N would be established, enabling proficient separation of photoinduced charges as demonstrated in Figure 14b.Due to higher ion exchange ability of Bt with the layered structure, there would be more production and separation of electrons and holes, resulting in significantly enhanced photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.However, a higher amount of CO production was evidently due to higher CO 2 uptake due to specific characteristics of Bt and lower production of protons for transforming CO 2 /CO to CH 4 .As shown in Figure 14c, a good 2D/2D heterojunction of Bt/g-C 3 N 4 coupled with WO 3 was achieved, resulting in proficient charge carrier separation. The charge carrier production and its transfer path within the semiconductors are demonstrated in Figure 14d.As visible light was used in this work and CB of WO 3 is not suitable for CO 2 reduction, enhanced photoactivity toward CO and CH 4 production can be ascribed to the formation of the Z-scheme WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction with Bt as the moderator for promoting charge carrier separation.Thus, Bt is favorable to trap electrons, resulting in efficient evolution of CO and CH 4 over the WBCN composite photocatalyst.Previously, Liu and co-workers reported enhanced CO 2 photoreduction with H 2 O for the production of fuels (CO and CH 4 ) over WN-WO 3 through the Z-scheme heterojunction. 63he thermodynamic reduction potentials for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to CO and CH 4 with photocatalyst band positions are demonstrated in Figure 14e.Thermodynamically, breaking the stable CO 2 molecule is a challenging task, and during CO 2 reduction, there would be competing water splitting reaction in addition of the CO 2 reduction process.Furthermore, for CO production, the reduction potential of CO 2 /CO (-0.48 eV) is less negative than the CB of g-C 3 N 4 (-1.22), and similarly, for CH 4 production, the CB of g-C 3 N 4 is more negative than CO 2 /CH 4 (-0.24eV) reduction potential, enabling a thermodynamically favorable process for the production of CO and CH 4 over the WBCN composite.Similarly, the valence band (VB) of WO 3 (VB 3.47 eV) is more positive than the oxidation of water for H /O 2 production, which would be favorable for more hydrogen production.The CH 4 production rate over the WBCN composite was highest due to more production of electrons and protons, resulting in selective methane formation.Therefore, Bt clay pillared with g-C 3 N 4 and embedded with WO 3 was found to be very promising to construct the 3D/2D/ 2D WO 3 /Bt/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction for stimulating photocatalytic CO 2 conversion to methane under visible light."}, {"llm generation": "Fixed-bed", "source": "In summary, the WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 Z-scheme heterojunction with Bt as the cocatalyst was successfully synthesized and tested for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction using water as the reducing agent in a fixed bed and gas-phase photoreactor system.", "context": "In summary, the WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 Z-scheme heterojunction with Bt as the cocatalyst was successfully synthesized and tested for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction using water as the reducing agent in a fixed bed and gas-phase photoreactor system.WO 3 / Bt/g-C 3 N 4 exhibits excellent photoactivity for both CO and CH 4 productions during the CO 2 photoreduction process under visible-light irradiation.The highest yields of CO and CH 4 of 37.4 and 118.9 mol h -1 were obtained using 150 mg of photocatalyst under 20 mW cm -2 light intensity.The amount of CH 4 production over the WO 3 /Bt/g-C 3 N 4 composite was 5.98-, 6.74-, and 25.19-fold higher than its production over WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 , Bt/g-C 3 N 4 , and g-C 3 N 4 samples, respectively.The production of CO and CH 4 over the WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composite varied by using different amounts of catalyst loading, providing information that interaction between light irradiation and catalyst is very important to maximize photocatalytic activity.The production rate of CH 4 was increased to 177.9 mol h -1 using 100 mW cm -2 light intensity under the same reaction conditions.A 1.49-fold improvement in performance of the WO 3 /Bt/g-C 3 N 4 composite was observed by increasing light intensity from 20 to 100 mW cm -2 due to more production of charge carriers over the composite photocatalyst surface.Highest QYs of 20.106 and 1.875 for CH 4 and CO were achieved over the WO 3 /Bt/g-C 3 N 4 composite with a selectivity of 72.82 for methane formation.In general, the significantly enhanced photocatalytic performance of the composite catalyst was due Energy Fuels to the formation of the direct Z-scheme system with higher redox potential for photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 to CO and CH 4 under visible-light irradiation.The stability analysis further confirms continuous fuel formation over entire irradiation time and employing multiple cycles without any decrement in productivity.The findings of the present work are expected to be utilized for constructing the Z-scheme heterojunction system without using noble metals with controlled morphology for tailoring photoinduced CO 2 reduction to fuels and which would also be helpful for other solar fuel application.
