Experimental Conditions of CdS-DMF-Catalyzed Photoreactions.Photoreductions of CO 2 were carried out as previously described. 1CO 2 was introduced to a DMF solution (2 mL) containing CdS nanocrystallites (2.5 mM, diatomic) as a photocatalyst and distilled triethylamine (TEA, 1 M) as an electron donor.The solution in a closed Pyrex tube (8 mm diameter) was irradiated with a 300 W halogen tungsten lamp using an optical filter of a saturated aqueous sodium nitrite solution ( 400 nm) under cooling on a water bath (25 C). Gas analysis of CO and H 2 was carried out using gas chromatography with an active carbon column.Formic acid analysis was performed using HPLC with an ion-exchange column.The details of these analysis are described elsewhere. 1mission Spectra and Lifetime Measurements.Emission measurements were carried out using a quartz cell with optical path length of 10 mm.A sample solution was introduced into the cell and then degassed by Ar (99.99).The cell was capped and sealed for emission measurements.Steady-state emission spectra were recorded with a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Model 850, Hitachi Ltd.). Emission lifetime measurements were carried out as follows.Excitation pulses were produced from a frequency-doubled mode-locked Ti:sapphire laser (Spectra-Physics, Tsunami, ) 730-820 nm, fwhm 60-100 fs, 400-700 mW (8.2 MHz)) pumped by an Ar laser (Spectra-Physics BeamLok 2060, 6-7 W).The samples were excited at ) 400 nm by the second harmonics of a mode-locked Ti:sapphire laser generated with BBO crystal at room temperature.The emission decay curve was measured by using a time-correlated single-photon-counting system (Hamamatsu Photonics R3809U) with a time resolution of about 40 ps/channel.The response of the system was integrated for 1 h for each sample.The lifetime of the emission was determined by a third-exponential decay law of the region between 0 and 10 ns. EXAFS Measurements and Analysis.Cd K-edge (26710 eV) EXAFS measurements were performed on the BL-14A at the Photon Factory of the National Laboratory for High Energy Physics.The details of these analysis are described elsewhere. 11,13The X-ray energy for solution samples was scanned with an integration time of 8 s and at steps of 1 eV in a XANES region (26 300-26 800 eV) and of 2 eV in a EXAFS region (26 800-27 600 eV).For powder samples, 2 and 3 eV steps with an integration time of 6 s were used in the XANES and EXAFS regions, respectively.The concentration of Cd atoms in DMF solution was 15 mM.For powder samples, pellets of Cd compounds (0.4 mmol cm -2 , 2 mm thick) mixed with polyethylene (reagent grade, Wako Pure Chemicals) as a binder were used. The EXAFS data were analyzed according to previously described standard procedures. 11The EXAFS spectra were extracted with normalization of the edge step, interpolation onto a photoelectron momentum vector, and subtraction of the postedge background.The resulting EXAFS oscillations were multiplied by k 3 and Fourier filtered with Hamming windows.The Fourier-filtered data were analyzed by nonlinear leastsquares curve-fitting techniques.Further details of the procedures have been presented elsewhere.Standard samples of bulk CdS powder (99.999,Aldrich) and a DMF solution of Cd-(ClO 4 ) 2 6H 2 O (reagent grade, Mitsuwa Pure Chemicals) provided the reference parameters for the first shell of Cd-S and of Cd-O, respectively. Theoretical Calculations.The geometrical structure of adsorbed CO 2 on the CdS surface was examined by a theoretical calculation using the DF program \"deMon\". 14The orientation and internal structure of the CO 2 molecule on the CdS catalyst surface, which was modeled by Cd 3 S 3 H 8 and Cd 3 S 2 H 8 clusters to represent the sulfur-vacancy-free catalyst and the catalyst with sulfur vacancy, respectively, were optimized.The atomic coordinates of the model cluster were taken from the hexagonal structure of the CdS crystal.The nearest Cd-S distance is 2.53 A, and the sulfur plane is 0.84 A higher than the cadmium plane.Hydrogen atoms were used to saturate the valence of the peripheral Cd and S atoms. The orbital basis sets used for Cd, S, C, O, and H atoms were (63321/53211/531 ), (311/211/1), (5211/411), (5211/ 411), and (41) or (3), respectively.For sulfur, the 1s to 2p electrons were replaced by a model core potential, and the polarization function was included.Both the polarization and diffuse and functions were added to the C and O atoms.Basis sets (41) and (3) were used for the H atoms representing Cd and S. Basis set (41) reflects that the orbital on Cd is more diffuse than that on S. The atoms outside the cluster were approximated by point charges, and 294 points were considered to cover the hemispherical region of radius 10 A.The magnitude of charges was set at 0.3 (0.3 for Cd and -0.3 for S) after consulting the results of our CdS slab calculation.The quality of the bases was equal to or greater than the split valence level.The uncontracted auxilliary fitting functions of types, (10/5/5), (5/3/3), (7/2/2), (7/2/2), and (6/1/1) were used for the Cd, S, C, O, and H atoms, respectively.The local potentials proposed by Vosko, Wilk, and Nusair were used throughout the calculations."}, {"llm generation": "CdS", "source": "Effect of Excess Cd 2 on CdS-Catalyzed Photoreduction of CO 2 .", "context": "Effect of Excess Cd 2 on CdS-Catalyzed Photoreduction of CO 2 .In photoreduction of CO 2 with CdS-DMF, the formation of CO was observed after induction period for 30 min as reported in the previous paper. 1In addition, we found that the photoreduction activity largely depended on the concentration of excess Cd 2 in the system. 1 Figure 1 shows the effect of excess Cd 2 on the photoproduction of CO after 1 h photoreaction.The CO formation was increased by a factor of 2 when 0.2 equivalent amount of excess Cd 2 to the concentration of CdS-DMF was added into the system.Induction period of the CO formation became shorter by the addition of excess Cd 2 .The addition of more than 0.2 equivalent of excess Cd 2 , however, led to a decrease of the photocatalytic activity.During the reaction with the system containing more than 0.2 equivalent of excess Cd 2 , photodarkening of the CdS-DMF solution was observed after 30 min irradiation.The photocatalytic activity of the system containing 0.8 equivalent of excess Cd 2 was less than that of the system without addition of excess Cd 2 .The formation of HCOOH, CH 3 OH, and (COOH) 2 was not observed in any systems. Effect of Excess Cd 2 on CdS-DMF Nanocrystallites.Emission Properties of CdS-DMF. Figure 2a shows the emission spectra of the CdS-DMF solution by excitation at ) 400 nm.The spectra consist of two broad-band peaks at ) 650 and 480 nm.Relatively strong emission at )650 nm is attributed to radiative recombination at deep trap sites originating from lattice imperfections at the surface, i.e., the surface states, and the emission at ) 480 nm is to direct recombination of electron and hole pairs at the bandgap. 15The relative intensities of the emissions depended on the amount of excess Cd 2 in the solution.The emission intensity at ) 650 nm increased as excess Cd 2 increased up to 0.2 equivalent and then decreased until 1.0 equivalent.This behavior was identical with the results reported by Henglein et al. 16 Relatively large enhancement of the emission at deep trap sites compared with that at the bandgap reflects that lattice imperfections on the surface of nanocrystallites, i.e., surface vacancies, 15a increase as excess Cd 2 is added into the system.It was confirmed that absorption spectrum was not affected by the addition of excess Cd 2 , indicating that size growth did not occur in the system under the present conditions.The decrease of the emission at the deep trap sites in the presence of more than 0.2 equivalent of excess Cd 2 should be due to the quenching of excited electrons in the reduction of free Cd 2 in the solution. 17This process was supported by the change of the color of the system due to the formation of Cd 0 on the surface of the nanocrystallites under irradiation. Emission-lifetime measurements in the nanosecond time region were also carried out for the emission at ) 480 and 650 nm. Figure 2b shows emission decay curves of CdS-DMF containing various amounts of excess Cd 2 .Multiexponential decay behavior was observed for both the emission bands.Decay curves at ) 480 nm was much faster than that at ) 650 nm.A fast decay component at ) 480 nm less than the order of nanoseconds was attributed to the recombination of electrons and holes.A slow decay component at ) 480 nm in the order of a few nanoseconds was attributed to thermal detrapping of the electron from the surface states to the conduction band since such thermal activation could enhance the lifetime at the band-edge emission.7d,15c,18 Figure 3 shows that average lifetimes of the both emission 19 depend on the amount of the added Cd 2 .The emission lifetime at ) 480 nm increased as excess Cd 2 increased up to 0.2 equivalent and then decreased.On the other hand, the lifetime at ) 650 nm was not affected in the region below 0.2 equivalent of excess Cd 2 .The emission lifetime at ) 650 nm gradually decreased when more than 0.2 equivalent of excess Cd 2 was added.The behavior of the lifetime in the region below 0.2 equivalent of excess Cd 2 can be explained by increment of the shallow trap sites.As the shallow trap sites increase, the lifetime at the bandedge emission could be elongated because of the increment of a thermally detrapped electron from the shallow trap sites to conduction band-edge states.We assumed that the added excess Cd 2 form not only the deep trap sites but also the shallow trap sites.Accordingly, the trap sites should be originated from lattice imperfections that should be formed on the surface of CdS-DMF nanocrystallites, as a result of adsorption of excess Cd 2 .The effect of the emission intensity and lifetime proved that the maximum number of the trap site was achieved when 0.2 equivalent of excess Cd 2 was introduced into the system.Increment of the trap sites affects the emission intensity at ) 650 nm rather than the lifetime of emission.In the system containing more than 0.2 equivalent of excess Cd 2 , the decrease of both emission intensity and lifetime suggests that the quenching process leading to a decrease of the trapped electrons could increase in this region.The quenching process might be attributed to the reduction of free Cd 2 to Cd 0 in the system. Surface Structures of CdS-DMF-Based on EXAFS Measurements.EXAFS measurements were carried out to confirm the microscopic surface structure of CdS-DMF in the presence of excess Cd 2 .Figure 4a,b shows phase-uncorrected Fourier transforms of k 3 -weighted EXAFS for standard samples (bulk CdS powder and a DMF solution of cadmium perchlorate).The peak at 2.09 A in the Fourier transform (Figure 4a) of EXAFS for bulk CdS powder can be assigned to a four-coordination of sulfur atoms in the CdS crystal lattice.The peak was observed at 1.80 A in the Fourier transform (Figure 4b) of EXAFS for a DMF solution of cadmium perchlorate.The solvation structure of a DMF solution of cadmium perchlorate has been established to be the six-coordinate octahedral structure. 20Thus, this main peak at 1.80 A was assigned to a six-coordination of a DMF oxygen atom to the DMF-solvated Cd 2 .Excellent fitting for Fourier-filtered k 3 (k) of standard samples (bulk CdS powder and a DMF solution of cadmium perchlorate) was achieved for the Cd-S shell (R ) 5.77) and the Cd-O shell (R ) 8.09) with extraction of the reference parameters 21 and the reported bond lengths of Cd-S (2.542 A) 22 and Cd-O (2.296 A) 20 as fixed parameters (Table 1). Figure 4c shows phase-uncorrected Fourier transform of k 3weighted EXAFS for a CdS-DMF solution without excess Cd 2 .The main peak at 2.05 A in the transform of CdS-DMF differs from that of bulk CdS (Figure 4b) with respect to the width of the absolute magnitude.These results suggest that the main peak in the transform of EXAFS of CdS-DMF solution is due to scattering not only by sulfur atoms in CdS-DMF nanocrystallites but also by oxygen atoms of DMF molecules solvated to surface Cd atoms of CdS-DMF nanocrystallites as mentioned in the previous paper. 11As shown in Table 1, analysis of Fourier-filtered k 3 (k) of the CdS-DMF solution gave an excellent fitting (R ) 6.43) with a two-shell fit of Cd-O and Cd-S, but not with a one-shell fit of Cd-S. Figure 4d,e shows phase-uncorrected Fourier transforms of k 3weighted EXAFS for the CdS-DMF/CdX (X ) 0.2 and 0.4) solutions, respectively.The increment of the intensity in the magnitude as well as the imaginary part was clearly observed.These results suggest that the contribution of the scattering due to the solvating DMF oxygen increased as the amount of excess Cd 2 increased.Two-shell fitting for Fourier-filtered k 3 (k) of a DMF solution of CdS-DMF/Cd0.2 and CdS-DMF/Cd0.4gave excellent fitting for CdS-DMF/Cd0.2(R ) 3.10) and CdS-DMF/Cd0.4(R ) 9.69) as shown in Table 1. Figure 5 shows the effect of excess Cd 2 on the coordination numbers of Cd-O and Cd-S determined by the EXAFS analysis.As excess Cd 2 4 suggests that the DMF-solvated free Cd 2 may exist in the system because the coordination number was larger than the estimated values using the models. 26The square of the Debye-Waller factor of CdS-DMF/Cd 0.4 also supports the existence of the free Cd 2 in the system. To correlate the photocatalytic activity with the surface structures, interaction between CO 2 molecule and the surface of the CdS-DMF photocatalyst was examined.Figure 6a shows the effect of CO 2 on the emission spectra of a DMF solution of CdS-DMF in the presence of TEA.The emission intensities at ) 480 and 650 nm increased drastically when CO 2 was introduced into the system.The decay curves of the emission monitored at ) 480 nm indicated that the emission lifetime was elongated by the addition of CO 2 (Figure 6b).This elongation of the lifetime due to the CO 2 addition was also observed at ) 650 nm.Although similar results were obtained in the absence of TEA, the effect of CO 2 on the emission was found to be much clearer in the presence of TEA. These emission reflects the behavior of photogenerated electron and hole pairs on CdS-DMF nanocrystallites.We propose an energy diagram explaining the effect of the addition of CO 2 and TEA as schematically shown in Scheme 2. The elongation of the emission in the nanosecond time scale should be attributed to an increase of a thermally detrapped electron on the conduction band of CdS-DMF nanocrystallites, i.e., the adsorbed CO 2 molecule on the surface should create the surface state that can delocalize photoformed electrons.Considering the efficient photoreduction of CO 2 to CO via successive twoelectron transfer on CdS-DMF nanocrystallites together with the present emission behavior, we assumed that CO 2 molecules favorably interact with the surface of CdS-DMF nanocrystallites, producing adsorbed CO 2 -on the CdS-DMF surface as an important intermediate, and that the adsorbed CO 2 -reinjects electrons into the conduction band, thus resulting in extending the lifetime of the excited electron.In the previous paper, we reported that the spectrum of CO 2 -trapped with 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) was observed in the EPR measurement in this system. 23These adsorbed CO 2 -on the CdS-DMF surface can undergo a successive electron-transfer reaction, resulting in the formation of CO.Thus, the enhancement of the emission intensity and the elongated lifetime of the emission in the presence of CO 2 should be evidence of the strong interaction of CO 2 molecules with the surface of CdS-DMF as observed in the ZnS-DMF systems.4d Optimized Structures of Adsorbed CO 2 Molecule on CdS.To evaluate the interaction between CO 2 molecules and surfaces of CdS-DMF, theoretical molecular orbital calculations using the DF method were performed.The catalyst surfaces were modeled by Cd 3 S 3 H 8 and Cd 3 S 2 H 8 clusters for a sulfur-vacancyfree surface (ideal surface) and a surface with a sulfur vacancy (S-defect surface), respectively.A surface with a sulfur vacancy model (Figure 7b) was formed by removing the central sulfur atom from the former model (Figure 7a).In calculations, we adapted three models to determine the total energy of the system.The first one is an O-end-on model where CO 2 molecule adsorbs via O atom to the surface as shown in Figure 8a,b.The second one is a C-absorbed model absorbed via C atom as shown in Figure 8c,d.In the third one, CO 2 molecule interacts with the surface via both O and C atom as shown in Figure 8e.We optimized each CO 2 -adsorbed structure and derived the total energy of the system with/without S-defect.The third model is available only for the model with S-defect, because the bidentate adsorption via O and C atom was not conceivable on the ideal surface.Furthermore, the states reduced by oneelectron, i.e., the electron-accepted model, of the structure and the total energy were also examined.Table 2 summarizes the stabilization energy (E) calculated by the following equation and the atomic charges of the selected atoms estimated by the Mulliken population.The stabilization energies for the neutral states of O-end-on models (ION, IOA, DON, DOA 24 ) and C-adsorbed models (ICN, ICA, DCN, DCA 24 ), respectively, were relatively small as shown in Table 2.These results indicate that the interactions between CO 2 and CdS surface are not strong.On the other hand, the stabilization energies for the neutral states of bidentatetype model on the S-defect surface (BN 24 ) was calculated to be 39.78 kcal/mol.In the electron-accepting anionic models, the stabilization energy for the O-end-on models and C-adsorbed models was comparable with that of corresponding neutral models.However, the stabilization energy for the electronaccepted model of the bidentate-type adsorption on S-defect surface (BA 24 ) increases to 50.92 kcal/mol.These results indicate that the bidentate-type absorption of CO 2 molecule on CdS surface with sulfur vacancies should be more stable than the other types of adsorption. Generally, the coordination of CO 2 to the transition metals has been reported to have coordination structure such as 2 -side-on, 1 -C-coordination, and 1 -O-end-on of CO 2 . 8In these structures, the adsorption of CO 2 molecule is stabilized by back-donation from metals to CO 2 .On the other hand, it was reported that CO 2 is bonded via both C and O ends in the system CO 2 /Rh/TiO 2 . 25The carbon atom of CO 2 is bonded to the Rh atom, while the oxygen atom of CO 2 is bonded to the oxygen vacancy of titania surface.In this system, TiO 2 donates an electron to surface Rh atoms, and as a result, the backdonation of electrons from Rh into the orbital of CO 2 , and the formation of partially and negatively charged CO 2 will occur on the surface.Bidentate-type adsorption of CO 2 on the CdS surface with S-vacancy (BN) may be a type of the adsorption corresponding to such adsorption. The calculations of the bond distances and the charge distribution support the above hypothesis (Table 2).The bond distance of Cd-C and Cd-O in BN and BA models were relatively shorter than those of the other models.The results suggest that CO 2 molecule in BN and BA model should be adsorbed with stronger interaction than CO 2 of the other models.In addition, the calculated C-O bond lengths and the angle of O-C-O of CO 2 molecule in the BN model are almost same as that of CO 2 -, 1.251 A and 133.3(compared to the experimental values of 1.250 A and 1342 6 ).In the other models, those values of the CO 2 molecule were almost the same as those of free CO 2 molecule, 1.170 A (compared to the experimental value of 1.162 A 26 ).The total atomic charges of CO 2 in the BN model were larger than those in the other models.The results suggest that the back-donation of electron from Cd atom to CO 2 molecule occurs, forming negatively charged CO 2 .In the electron-accepted models, the negative charge of CO 2 was increased through bidentate-type adsorption (BA), while the other type models were comparable with the neutral state models.These results indicate that electron transfer from the electron-accepted CdS to absorbed CO 2 might proceed with the bidentate-type adsorption on the S-defect surface. The strong interaction shown in the bidentate-type absorption supports the importance of surface sulfur vacancy in adsorption of CO 2 molecules on the surface of CdS nanocrystallites.The localized charge on CO 2 molecule in the BA model indicates that the next electron transfer to CO 2 may be easy to proceed on the surface with sulfur vacancies. Mechanism of Photoreduction of CO 2 Molecules.The importance of sulfur vacancies are derived from the following observations and facts: (1) The photocatalytic activity for CO production was increased when 0.2 equivalent amount of excess Cd 2 was added into the system, (2) the results from emission and EXAFS measurements supported that the sulfur vacancies on CdS-DMF surface are formed by reaction with the added Cd 2 in the systems, (3) MO calculations with the DF method supported the strong interaction between CO 2 molecule and CdS surface with sulfur vacancies through bidentate-type adsorption of CO 2 .From these points of view, the Cd atoms in the vicinity of sulfur vacancies should act as adsorptive sites for CO 2 molecule.According to these results, we postulate here a mechanism for the photoreduction of CO 2 to CO on the CdS-DMF nanocrystallites by focusing the importance of sulfur vacancies (Scheme 3). Upon visible light irradiation of the CdS-DMF system, the photoformed electron on the conduction band migrates to the adsorbed CO 2 , forming adsorbed CO 2 -on Cd atoms of CdS-DMF nanocrystallites, where CO 2 interacts with the Cd atom through the C and O atoms.On the surface of CdS-DMF with sulfur vacancies, CO 2 -may accept successive electrons after forming a Cd 2 OCOCO 2 complex through reaction with another CO 2 .This complex may be reduced, leading to CO elimination, as has been reported in electrical CO 2 reduction to CO. 27"}, {"llm generation": "CdS-DMF", "source": "In photoreduction of CO 2 with CdS-DMF, the formation of CO was observed after induction period for 30 min as reported in the previous paper.", "context": "Effect of Excess Cd 2 on CdS-Catalyzed Photoreduction of CO 2 .In photoreduction of CO 2 with CdS-DMF, the formation of CO was observed after induction period for 30 min as reported in the previous paper. 1In addition, we found that the photoreduction activity largely depended on the concentration of excess Cd 2 in the system. 1 Figure 1 shows the effect of excess Cd 2 on the photoproduction of CO after 1 h photoreaction.The CO formation was increased by a factor of 2 when 0.2 equivalent amount of excess Cd 2 to the concentration of CdS-DMF was added into the system.Induction period of the CO formation became shorter by the addition of excess Cd 2 .The addition of more than 0.2 equivalent of excess Cd 2 , however, led to a decrease of the photocatalytic activity.During the reaction with the system containing more than 0.2 equivalent of excess Cd 2 , photodarkening of the CdS-DMF solution was observed after 30 min irradiation.The photocatalytic activity of the system containing 0.8 equivalent of excess Cd 2 was less than that of the system without addition of excess Cd 2 .The formation of HCOOH, CH 3 OH, and (COOH) 2 was not observed in any systems.

Figure 4d,e shows phase-uncorrected Fourier transforms of k 3weighted EXAFS for the CdS-DMF/CdX (X ) 0.2 and 0.4) solutions, respectively.The increment of the intensity in the magnitude as well as the imaginary part was clearly observed.These results suggest that the contribution of the scattering due to the solvating DMF oxygen increased as the amount of excess Cd 2 increased.Two-shell fitting for Fourier-filtered k 3 (k) of a DMF solution of CdS-DMF/Cd0.2 and CdS-DMF/Cd0.4gave excellent fitting for CdS-DMF/Cd0.2(R ) 3.10) and CdS-DMF/Cd0.4(R ) 9.69) as shown in Table 1. Figure 5 shows the effect of excess Cd 2 on the coordination numbers of Cd-O and Cd-S determined by the EXAFS analysis.As excess Cd 2 4 suggests that the DMF-solvated free Cd 2 may exist in the system because the coordination number was larger than the estimated values using the models. 26The square of the Debye-Waller factor of CdS-DMF/Cd 0.4 also supports the existence of the free Cd 2 in the system. To correlate the photocatalytic activity with the surface structures, interaction between CO 2 molecule and the surface of the CdS-DMF photocatalyst was examined.Figure 6a shows the effect of CO 2 on the emission spectra of a DMF solution of CdS-DMF in the presence of TEA.The emission intensities at ) 480 and 650 nm increased drastically when CO 2 was introduced into the system.The decay curves of the emission monitored at ) 480 nm indicated that the emission lifetime was elongated by the addition of CO 2 (Figure 6b).This elongation of the lifetime due to the CO 2 addition was also observed at ) 650 nm.Although similar results were obtained in the absence of TEA, the effect of CO 2 on the emission was found to be much clearer in the presence of TEA. These emission reflects the behavior of photogenerated electron and hole pairs on CdS-DMF nanocrystallites.We propose an energy diagram explaining the effect of the addition of CO 2 and TEA as schematically shown in Scheme 2. The elongation of the emission in the nanosecond time scale should be attributed to an increase of a thermally detrapped electron on the conduction band of CdS-DMF nanocrystallites, i.e., the adsorbed CO 2 molecule on the surface should create the surface state that can delocalize photoformed electrons.Considering the efficient photoreduction of CO 2 to CO via successive twoelectron transfer on CdS-DMF nanocrystallites together with the present emission behavior, we assumed that CO 2 molecules favorably interact with the surface of CdS-DMF nanocrystallites, producing adsorbed CO 2 -on the CdS-DMF surface as an important intermediate, and that the adsorbed CO 2 -reinjects electrons into the conduction band, thus resulting in extending the lifetime of the excited electron.In the previous paper, we reported that the spectrum of CO 2 -trapped with 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) was observed in the EPR measurement in this system. 23These adsorbed CO 2 -on the CdS-DMF surface can undergo a successive electron-transfer reaction, resulting in the formation of CO.Thus, the enhancement of the emission intensity and the elongated lifetime of the emission in the presence of CO 2 should be evidence of the strong interaction of CO 2 molecules with the surface of CdS-DMF as observed in the ZnS-DMF systems.4d Optimized Structures of Adsorbed CO 2 Molecule on CdS.To evaluate the interaction between CO 2 molecules and surfaces of CdS-DMF, theoretical molecular orbital calculations using the DF method were performed.The catalyst surfaces were modeled by Cd 3 S 3 H 8 and Cd 3 S 2 H 8 clusters for a sulfur-vacancyfree surface (ideal surface) and a surface with a sulfur vacancy (S-defect surface), respectively.A surface with a sulfur vacancy model (Figure 7b) was formed by removing the central sulfur atom from the former model (Figure 7a).In calculations, we adapted three models to determine the total energy of the system.The first one is an O-end-on model where CO 2 molecule adsorbs via O atom to the surface as shown in Figure 8a,b.The second one is a C-absorbed model absorbed via C atom as shown in Figure 8c,d.In the third one, CO 2 molecule interacts with the surface via both O and C atom as shown in Figure 8e.We optimized each CO 2 -adsorbed structure and derived the total energy of the system with/without S-defect.The third model is available only for the model with S-defect, because the bidentate adsorption via O and C atom was not conceivable on the ideal surface.Furthermore, the states reduced by oneelectron, i.e., the electron-accepted model, of the structure and the total energy were also examined.Table 2 summarizes the stabilization energy (E) calculated by the following equation and the atomic charges of the selected atoms estimated by the Mulliken population.The stabilization energies for the neutral states of O-end-on models (ION, IOA, DON, DOA 24 ) and C-adsorbed models (ICN, ICA, DCN, DCA 24 ), respectively, were relatively small as shown in Table 2.These results indicate that the interactions between CO 2 and CdS surface are not strong.On the other hand, the stabilization energies for the neutral states of bidentatetype model on the S-defect surface (BN 24 ) was calculated to be 39.78 kcal/mol.In the electron-accepting anionic models, the stabilization energy for the O-end-on models and C-adsorbed models was comparable with that of corresponding neutral models.However, the stabilization energy for the electronaccepted model of the bidentate-type adsorption on S-defect surface (BA 24 ) increases to 50.92 kcal/mol.These results indicate that the bidentate-type absorption of CO 2 molecule on CdS surface with sulfur vacancies should be more stable than the other types of adsorption. Generally, the coordination of CO 2 to the transition metals has been reported to have coordination structure such as 2 -side-on, 1 -C-coordination, and 1 -O-end-on of CO 2 . 8In these structures, the adsorption of CO 2 molecule is stabilized by back-donation from metals to CO 2 .On the other hand, it was reported that CO 2 is bonded via both C and O ends in the system CO 2 /Rh/TiO 2 . 25The carbon atom of CO 2 is bonded to the Rh atom, while the oxygen atom of CO 2 is bonded to the oxygen vacancy of titania surface.In this system, TiO 2 donates an electron to surface Rh atoms, and as a result, the backdonation of electrons from Rh into the orbital of CO 2 , and the formation of partially and negatively charged CO 2 will occur on the surface.Bidentate-type adsorption of CO 2 on the CdS surface with S-vacancy (BN) may be a type of the adsorption corresponding to such adsorption. The calculations of the bond distances and the charge distribution support the above hypothesis (Table 2).The bond distance of Cd-C and Cd-O in BN and BA models were relatively shorter than those of the other models.The results suggest that CO 2 molecule in BN and BA model should be adsorbed with stronger interaction than CO 2 of the other models.In addition, the calculated C-O bond lengths and the angle of O-C-O of CO 2 molecule in the BN model are almost same as that of CO 2 -, 1.251 A and 133.3(compared to the experimental values of 1.250 A and 1342 6 ).In the other models, those values of the CO 2 molecule were almost the same as those of free CO 2 molecule, 1.170 A (compared to the experimental value of 1.162 A 26 ).The total atomic charges of CO 2 in the BN model were larger than those in the other models.The results suggest that the back-donation of electron from Cd atom to CO 2 molecule occurs, forming negatively charged CO 2 .In the electron-accepted models, the negative charge of CO 2 was increased through bidentate-type adsorption (BA), while the other type models were comparable with the neutral state models.These results indicate that electron transfer from the electron-accepted CdS to absorbed CO 2 might proceed with the bidentate-type adsorption on the S-defect surface. The strong interaction shown in the bidentate-type absorption supports the importance of surface sulfur vacancy in adsorption of CO 2 molecules on the surface of CdS nanocrystallites.The localized charge on CO 2 molecule in the BA model indicates that the next electron transfer to CO 2 may be easy to proceed on the surface with sulfur vacancies. Mechanism of Photoreduction of CO 2 Molecules.The importance of sulfur vacancies are derived from the following observations and facts: (1) The photocatalytic activity for CO production was increased when 0.2 equivalent amount of excess Cd 2 was added into the system, (2) the results from emission and EXAFS measurements supported that the sulfur vacancies on CdS-DMF surface are formed by reaction with the added Cd 2 in the systems, (3) MO calculations with the DF method supported the strong interaction between CO 2 molecule and CdS surface with sulfur vacancies through bidentate-type adsorption of CO 2 .From these points of view, the Cd atoms in the vicinity of sulfur vacancies should act as adsorptive sites for CO 2 molecule.According to these results, we postulate here a mechanism for the photoreduction of CO 2 to CO on the CdS-DMF nanocrystallites by focusing the importance of sulfur vacancies (Scheme 3). Upon visible light irradiation of the CdS-DMF system, the photoformed electron on the conduction band migrates to the adsorbed CO 2 , forming adsorbed CO 2 -on Cd atoms of CdS-DMF nanocrystallites, where CO 2 interacts with the Cd atom through the C and O atoms.On the surface of CdS-DMF with sulfur vacancies, CO 2 -may accept successive electrons after forming a Cd 2 OCOCO 2 complex through reaction with another CO 2 .This complex may be reduced, leading to CO elimination, as has been reported in electrical CO 2 reduction to CO. 27"}, {"llm generation": "CdS-DMF", "source": "Figure 1.Effect of the addition of excess Cd 2 on efficiency of the CdS-DMF-catalyzed CO formation.", "context": "Mechanistic investigation of CdS photocatalytic system for CO 2 reduction was carried out in view of surface structures of the CdS nanocrystallites and CO 2 molecules.The present system is characterized by drastic improvement of photocatalytic activity through the formation of sulfur vacancies.The formation of sulfur vacancies on CdS-DMF nanocrystallites was confirmed by the static and dynamic emission measurements, and in situ Cd K-edge EXAFS analysis.Adsorptive interaction between the surface of the nanocrystallites and CO 2 molecules was confirmed by the increment of emission intensity and the elongation of lifetime of the emission.MO calculations also supports the adsorptive interaction on the CdS surface with sulfur vacancies.The CO formation process via adsorption of CO 2 to Cd atom in the vicinity of sulfur vacancy was newly proposed.

Emission lifetime measurements were carried out as follows.Excitation pulses were produced from a frequency-doubled mode-locked Ti:sapphire laser (Spectra-Physics, Tsunami, ) 730-820 nm, fwhm 60-100 fs, 400-700 mW (8.2 MHz)) pumped by an Ar laser (Spectra-Physics BeamLok 2060, 6-7 W).The samples were excited at ) 400 nm by the second harmonics of a mode-locked Ti:sapphire laser generated with BBO crystal at room temperature.The emission decay curve was measured by using a time-correlated single-photon-counting system (Hamamatsu Photonics R3809U) with a time resolution of about 40 ps/channel.The response of the system was integrated for 1 h for each sample.The lifetime of the emission was determined by a third-exponential decay law of the region between 0 and 10 ns. EXAFS Measurements and Analysis.Cd K-edge (26710 eV) EXAFS measurements were performed on the BL-14A at the Photon Factory of the National Laboratory for High Energy Physics.The details of these analysis are described elsewhere. 11,13The X-ray energy for solution samples was scanned with an integration time of 8 s and at steps of 1 eV in a XANES region (26 300-26 800 eV) and of 2 eV in a EXAFS region (26 800-27 600 eV).For powder samples, 2 and 3 eV steps with an integration time of 6 s were used in the XANES and EXAFS regions, respectively.The concentration of Cd atoms in DMF solution was 15 mM.For powder samples, pellets of Cd compounds (0.4 mmol cm -2 , 2 mm thick) mixed with polyethylene (reagent grade, Wako Pure Chemicals) as a binder were used. The EXAFS data were analyzed according to previously described standard procedures. 11The EXAFS spectra were extracted with normalization of the edge step, interpolation onto a photoelectron momentum vector, and subtraction of the postedge background.The resulting EXAFS oscillations were multiplied by k 3 and Fourier filtered with Hamming windows.The Fourier-filtered data were analyzed by nonlinear leastsquares curve-fitting techniques.Further details of the procedures have been presented elsewhere.Standard samples of bulk CdS powder (99.999,Aldrich) and a DMF solution of Cd-(ClO 4 ) 2 6H 2 O (reagent grade, Mitsuwa Pure Chemicals) provided the reference parameters for the first shell of Cd-S and of Cd-O, respectively. Theoretical Calculations.The geometrical structure of adsorbed CO 2 on the CdS surface was examined by a theoretical calculation using the DF program \"deMon\". 14The orientation and internal structure of the CO 2 molecule on the CdS catalyst surface, which was modeled by Cd 3 S 3 H 8 and Cd 3 S 2 H 8 clusters to represent the sulfur-vacancy-free catalyst and the catalyst with sulfur vacancy, respectively, were optimized.The atomic coordinates of the model cluster were taken from the hexagonal structure of the CdS crystal.The nearest Cd-S distance is 2.53 A, and the sulfur plane is 0.84 A higher than the cadmium plane.Hydrogen atoms were used to saturate the valence of the peripheral Cd and S atoms. The orbital basis sets used for Cd, S, C, O, and H atoms were (63321/53211/531 ), (311/211/1), (5211/411), (5211/ 411), and (41) or (3), respectively.For sulfur, the 1s to 2p electrons were replaced by a model core potential, and the polarization function was included.Both the polarization and diffuse and functions were added to the C and O atoms.Basis sets (41) and (3) were used for the H atoms representing Cd and S. Basis set (41) reflects that the orbital on Cd is more diffuse than that on S. The atoms outside the cluster were approximated by point charges, and 294 points were considered to cover the hemispherical region of radius 10 A.The magnitude of charges was set at 0.3 (0.3 for Cd and -0.3 for S) after consulting the results of our CdS slab calculation.The quality of the bases was equal to or greater than the split valence level.The uncontracted auxilliary fitting functions of types, (10/5/5), (5/3/3), (7/2/2), (7/2/2), and (6/1/1) were used for the Cd, S, C, O, and H atoms, respectively.The local potentials proposed by Vosko, Wilk, and Nusair were used throughout the calculations."}, {"llm generation": "Monochromatic (400 nm)", "source": "Figure 2.(a) Effect of excess Cd 2 addition on emission spectra excited at ) 400 nm.(b) Effect of excess Cd 2 addition on the emission lifetime excited at ) 400 nm (upper spectra were monitored at 480 nm; lower spectra were monitored at 650 nm).", "context": "Mechanistic investigation of CdS photocatalytic system for CO 2 reduction was carried out in view of surface structures of the CdS nanocrystallites and CO 2 molecules.The present system is characterized by drastic improvement of photocatalytic activity through the formation of sulfur vacancies.The formation of sulfur vacancies on CdS-DMF nanocrystallites was confirmed by the static and dynamic emission measurements, and in situ Cd K-edge EXAFS analysis.Adsorptive interaction between the surface of the nanocrystallites and CO 2 molecules was confirmed by the increment of emission intensity and the elongation of lifetime of the emission.MO calculations also supports the adsorptive interaction on the CdS surface with sulfur vacancies.The CO formation process via adsorption of CO 2 to Cd atom in the vicinity of sulfur vacancy was newly proposed.

The EXAFS data were analyzed according to previously described standard procedures. 11The EXAFS spectra were extracted with normalization of the edge step, interpolation onto a photoelectron momentum vector, and subtraction of the postedge background.The resulting EXAFS oscillations were multiplied by k 3 and Fourier filtered with Hamming windows.The Fourier-filtered data were analyzed by nonlinear leastsquares curve-fitting techniques.Further details of the procedures have been presented elsewhere.Standard samples of bulk CdS powder (99.999,Aldrich) and a DMF solution of Cd-(ClO 4 ) 2 6H 2 O (reagent grade, Mitsuwa Pure Chemicals) provided the reference parameters for the first shell of Cd-S and of Cd-O, respectively. Theoretical Calculations.The geometrical structure of adsorbed CO 2 on the CdS surface was examined by a theoretical calculation using the DF program \"deMon\". 14The orientation and internal structure of the CO 2 molecule on the CdS catalyst surface, which was modeled by Cd 3 S 3 H 8 and Cd 3 S 2 H 8 clusters to represent the sulfur-vacancy-free catalyst and the catalyst with sulfur vacancy, respectively, were optimized.The atomic coordinates of the model cluster were taken from the hexagonal structure of the CdS crystal.The nearest Cd-S distance is 2.53 A, and the sulfur plane is 0.84 A higher than the cadmium plane.Hydrogen atoms were used to saturate the valence of the peripheral Cd and S atoms.

Effect of Excess Cd 2 on CdS-DMF Nanocrystallites.Emission Properties of CdS-DMF. Figure 2a shows the emission spectra of the CdS-DMF solution by excitation at ) 400 nm.The spectra consist of two broad-band peaks at ) 650 and 480 nm.Relatively strong emission at )650 nm is attributed to radiative recombination at deep trap sites originating from lattice imperfections at the surface, i.e., the surface states, and the emission at ) 480 nm is to direct recombination of electron and hole pairs at the bandgap. 15The relative intensities of the emissions depended on the amount of excess Cd 2 in the solution.The emission intensity at ) 650 nm increased as excess Cd 2 increased up to 0.2 equivalent and then decreased until 1.0 equivalent.This behavior was identical with the results reported by Henglein et al. 16 Relatively large enhancement of the emission at deep trap sites compared with that at the bandgap reflects that lattice imperfections on the surface of nanocrystallites, i.e., surface vacancies, 15a increase as excess Cd 2 is added into the system.It was confirmed that absorption spectrum was not affected by the addition of excess Cd 2 , indicating that size growth did not occur in the system under the present conditions.The decrease of the emission at the deep trap sites in the presence of more than 0.2 equivalent of excess Cd 2 should be due to the quenching of excited electrons in the reduction of free Cd 2 in the solution. 17This process was supported by the change of the color of the system due to the formation of Cd 0 on the surface of the nanocrystallites under irradiation. Emission-lifetime measurements in the nanosecond time region were also carried out for the emission at ) 480 and 650 nm. Figure 2b shows emission decay curves of CdS-DMF containing various amounts of excess Cd 2 .Multiexponential decay behavior was observed for both the emission bands.Decay curves at ) 480 nm was much faster than that at ) 650 nm.A fast decay component at ) 480 nm less than the order of nanoseconds was attributed to the recombination of electrons and holes.A slow decay component at ) 480 nm in the order of a few nanoseconds was attributed to thermal detrapping of the electron from the surface states to the conduction band since such thermal activation could enhance the lifetime at the band-edge emission.7d,15c,18 Figure 3 shows that average lifetimes of the both emission 19 depend on the amount of the added Cd 2 .The emission lifetime at ) 480 nm increased as excess Cd 2 increased up to 0.2 equivalent and then decreased.On the other hand, the lifetime at ) 650 nm was not affected in the region below 0.2 equivalent of excess Cd 2 .The emission lifetime at ) 650 nm gradually decreased when more than 0.2 equivalent of excess Cd 2 was added.The behavior of the lifetime in the region below 0.2 equivalent of excess Cd 2 can be explained by increment of the shallow trap sites.As the shallow trap sites increase, the lifetime at the bandedge emission could be elongated because of the increment of a thermally detrapped electron from the shallow trap sites to conduction band-edge states.We assumed that the added excess Cd 2 form not only the deep trap sites but also the shallow trap sites.Accordingly, the trap sites should be originated from lattice imperfections that should be formed on the surface of CdS-DMF nanocrystallites, as a result of adsorption of excess Cd 2 .The effect of the emission intensity and lifetime proved that the maximum number of the trap site was achieved when 0.2 equivalent of excess Cd 2 was introduced into the system.Increment of the trap sites affects the emission intensity at ) 650 nm rather than the lifetime of emission.In the system containing more than 0.2 equivalent of excess Cd 2 , the decrease of both emission intensity and lifetime suggests that the quenching process leading to a decrease of the trapped electrons could increase in this region.The quenching process might be attributed to the reduction of free Cd 2 to Cd 0 in the system. Surface Structures of CdS-DMF-Based on EXAFS Measurements.EXAFS measurements were carried out to confirm the microscopic surface structure of CdS-DMF in the presence of excess Cd 2 .Figure 4a,b shows phase-uncorrected Fourier transforms of k 3 -weighted EXAFS for standard samples (bulk CdS powder and a DMF solution of cadmium perchlorate).The peak at 2.09 A in the Fourier transform (Figure 4a) of EXAFS for bulk CdS powder can be assigned to a four-coordination of sulfur atoms in the CdS crystal lattice.The peak was observed at 1.80 A in the Fourier transform (Figure 4b) of EXAFS for a DMF solution of cadmium perchlorate.The solvation structure of a DMF solution of cadmium perchlorate has been established to be the six-coordinate octahedral structure. 20Thus, this main peak at 1.80 A was assigned to a six-coordination of a DMF oxygen atom to the DMF-solvated Cd 2 .Excellent fitting for Fourier-filtered k 3 (k) of standard samples (bulk CdS powder and a DMF solution of cadmium perchlorate) was achieved for the Cd-S shell (R ) 5.77) and the Cd-O shell (R ) 8.09) with extraction of the reference parameters 21 and the reported bond lengths of Cd-S (2.542 A) 22 and Cd-O (2.296 A) 20 as fixed parameters (Table 1). Figure 4c shows phase-uncorrected Fourier transform of k 3weighted EXAFS for a CdS-DMF solution without excess Cd 2 .The main peak at 2.05 A in the transform of CdS-DMF differs from that of bulk CdS (Figure 4b) with respect to the width of the absolute magnitude.These results suggest that the main peak in the transform of EXAFS of CdS-DMF solution is due to scattering not only by sulfur atoms in CdS-DMF nanocrystallites but also by oxygen atoms of DMF molecules solvated to surface Cd atoms of CdS-DMF nanocrystallites as mentioned in the previous paper. 11As shown in Table 1, analysis of Fourier-filtered k 3 (k) of the CdS-DMF solution gave an excellent fitting (R ) 6.43) with a two-shell fit of Cd-O and Cd-S, but not with a one-shell fit of Cd-S. Figure 4d,e shows phase-uncorrected Fourier transforms of k 3weighted EXAFS for the CdS-DMF/CdX (X ) 0.2 and 0.4) solutions, respectively.The increment of the intensity in the magnitude as well as the imaginary part was clearly observed.These results suggest that the contribution of the scattering due to the solvating DMF oxygen increased as the amount of excess Cd 2 increased.Two-shell fitting for Fourier-filtered k 3 (k) of a DMF solution of CdS-DMF/Cd0.2 and CdS-DMF/Cd0.4gave excellent fitting for CdS-DMF/Cd0.2(R ) 3.10) and CdS-DMF/Cd0.4(R ) 9.69) as shown in Table 1. Figure 5 shows the effect of excess Cd 2 on the coordination numbers of Cd-O and Cd-S determined by the EXAFS analysis.As excess Cd 2 4 suggests that the DMF-solvated free Cd 2 may exist in the system because the coordination number was larger than the estimated values using the models. 26The square of the Debye-Waller factor of CdS-DMF/Cd 0.4 also supports the existence of the free Cd 2 in the system. To correlate the photocatalytic activity with the surface structures, interaction between CO 2 molecule and the surface of the CdS-DMF photocatalyst was examined.Figure 6a shows the effect of CO 2 on the emission spectra of a DMF solution of CdS-DMF in the presence of TEA.The emission intensities at ) 480 and 650 nm increased drastically when CO 2 was introduced into the system.The decay curves of the emission monitored at ) 480 nm indicated that the emission lifetime was elongated by the addition of CO 2 (Figure 6b).This elongation of the lifetime due to the CO 2 addition was also observed at ) 650 nm.Although similar results were obtained in the absence of TEA, the effect of CO 2 on the emission was found to be much clearer in the presence of TEA. These emission reflects the behavior of photogenerated electron and hole pairs on CdS-DMF nanocrystallites.We propose an energy diagram explaining the effect of the addition of CO 2 and TEA as schematically shown in Scheme 2. The elongation of the emission in the nanosecond time scale should be attributed to an increase of a thermally detrapped electron on the conduction band of CdS-DMF nanocrystallites, i.e., the adsorbed CO 2 molecule on the surface should create the surface state that can delocalize photoformed electrons.Considering the efficient photoreduction of CO 2 to CO via successive twoelectron transfer on CdS-DMF nanocrystallites together with the present emission behavior, we assumed that CO 2 molecules favorably interact with the surface of CdS-DMF nanocrystallites, producing adsorbed CO 2 -on the CdS-DMF surface as an important intermediate, and that the adsorbed CO 2 -reinjects electrons into the conduction band, thus resulting in extending the lifetime of the excited electron.In the previous paper, we reported that the spectrum of CO 2 -trapped with 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) was observed in the EPR measurement in this system. 23These adsorbed CO 2 -on the CdS-DMF surface can undergo a successive electron-transfer reaction, resulting in the formation of CO.Thus, the enhancement of the emission intensity and the elongated lifetime of the emission in the presence of CO 2 should be evidence of the strong interaction of CO 2 molecules with the surface of CdS-DMF as observed in the ZnS-DMF systems.4d Optimized Structures of Adsorbed CO 2 Molecule on CdS.To evaluate the interaction between CO 2 molecules and surfaces of CdS-DMF, theoretical molecular orbital calculations using the DF method were performed.The catalyst surfaces were modeled by Cd 3 S 3 H 8 and Cd 3 S 2 H 8 clusters for a sulfur-vacancyfree surface (ideal surface) and a surface with a sulfur vacancy (S-defect surface), respectively.A surface with a sulfur vacancy model (Figure 7b) was formed by removing the central sulfur atom from the former model (Figure 7a).In calculations, we adapted three models to determine the total energy of the system.The first one is an O-end-on model where CO 2 molecule adsorbs via O atom to the surface as shown in Figure 8a,b.The second one is a C-absorbed model absorbed via C atom as shown in Figure 8c,d.In the third one, CO 2 molecule interacts with the surface via both O and C atom as shown in Figure 8e.We optimized each CO 2 -adsorbed structure and derived the total energy of the system with/without S-defect.The third model is available only for the model with S-defect, because the bidentate adsorption via O and C atom was not conceivable on the ideal surface.Furthermore, the states reduced by oneelectron, i.e., the electron-accepted model, of the structure and the total energy were also examined.Table 2 summarizes the stabilization energy (E) calculated by the following equation and the atomic charges of the selected atoms estimated by the Mulliken population.The stabilization energies for the neutral states of O-end-on models (ION, IOA, DON, DOA 24 ) and C-adsorbed models (ICN, ICA, DCN, DCA 24 ), respectively, were relatively small as shown in Table 2.These results indicate that the interactions between CO 2 and CdS surface are not strong.On the other hand, the stabilization energies for the neutral states of bidentatetype model on the S-defect surface (BN 24 ) was calculated to be 39.78 kcal/mol.In the electron-accepting anionic models, the stabilization energy for the O-end-on models and C-adsorbed models was comparable with that of corresponding neutral models.However, the stabilization energy for the electronaccepted model of the bidentate-type adsorption on S-defect surface (BA 24 ) increases to 50.92 kcal/mol.These results indicate that the bidentate-type absorption of CO 2 molecule on CdS surface with sulfur vacancies should be more stable than the other types of adsorption. Generally, the coordination of CO 2 to the transition metals has been reported to have coordination structure such as 2 -side-on, 1 -C-coordination, and 1 -O-end-on of CO 2 . 8In these structures, the adsorption of CO 2 molecule is stabilized by back-donation from metals to CO 2 .On the other hand, it was reported that CO 2 is bonded via both C and O ends in the system CO 2 /Rh/TiO 2 . 25The carbon atom of CO 2 is bonded to the Rh atom, while the oxygen atom of CO 2 is bonded to the oxygen vacancy of titania surface.In this system, TiO 2 donates an electron to surface Rh atoms, and as a result, the backdonation of electrons from Rh into the orbital of CO 2 , and the formation of partially and negatively charged CO 2 will occur on the surface.Bidentate-type adsorption of CO 2 on the CdS surface with S-vacancy (BN) may be a type of the adsorption corresponding to such adsorption. The calculations of the bond distances and the charge distribution support the above hypothesis (Table 2).The bond distance of Cd-C and Cd-O in BN and BA models were relatively shorter than those of the other models.The results suggest that CO 2 molecule in BN and BA model should be adsorbed with stronger interaction than CO 2 of the other models.In addition, the calculated C-O bond lengths and the angle of O-C-O of CO 2 molecule in the BN model are almost same as that of CO 2 -, 1.251 A and 133.3(compared to the experimental values of 1.250 A and 1342 6 ).In the other models, those values of the CO 2 molecule were almost the same as those of free CO 2 molecule, 1.170 A (compared to the experimental value of 1.162 A 26 ).The total atomic charges of CO 2 in the BN model were larger than those in the other models.The results suggest that the back-donation of electron from Cd atom to CO 2 molecule occurs, forming negatively charged CO 2 .In the electron-accepted models, the negative charge of CO 2 was increased through bidentate-type adsorption (BA), while the other type models were comparable with the neutral state models.These results indicate that electron transfer from the electron-accepted CdS to absorbed CO 2 might proceed with the bidentate-type adsorption on the S-defect surface. The strong interaction shown in the bidentate-type absorption supports the importance of surface sulfur vacancy in adsorption of CO 2 molecules on the surface of CdS nanocrystallites.The localized charge on CO 2 molecule in the BA model indicates that the next electron transfer to CO 2 may be easy to proceed on the surface with sulfur vacancies. Mechanism of Photoreduction of CO 2 Molecules.The importance of sulfur vacancies are derived from the following observations and facts: (1) The photocatalytic activity for CO production was increased when 0.2 equivalent amount of excess Cd 2 was added into the system, (2) the results from emission and EXAFS measurements supported that the sulfur vacancies on CdS-DMF surface are formed by reaction with the added Cd 2 in the systems, (3) MO calculations with the DF method supported the strong interaction between CO 2 molecule and CdS surface with sulfur vacancies through bidentate-type adsorption of CO 2 .From these points of view, the Cd atoms in the vicinity of sulfur vacancies should act as adsorptive sites for CO 2 molecule.According to these results, we postulate here a mechanism for the photoreduction of CO 2 to CO on the CdS-DMF nanocrystallites by focusing the importance of sulfur vacancies (Scheme 3). Upon visible light irradiation of the CdS-DMF system, the photoformed electron on the conduction band migrates to the adsorbed CO 2 , forming adsorbed CO 2 -on Cd atoms of CdS-DMF nanocrystallites, where CO 2 interacts with the Cd atom through the C and O atoms.On the surface of CdS-DMF with sulfur vacancies, CO 2 -may accept successive electrons after forming a Cd 2 OCOCO 2 complex through reaction with another CO 2 .This complex may be reduced, leading to CO elimination, as has been reported in electrical CO 2 reduction to CO. 27"}], "reactor type": [], "operation mode": []}}
