Photoelectric current was measured in 0.5 M Na 2 SO 4 solution with 0.3 V bias potential by three-electrode system and CHI 650E workstation.Platinum sheet as the counter electrode and Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode, the working electrode was prepared by the following method: the 10 mg photocatalyst was ultrasound suspended in 1 mL ethanol for 20 min and added 10 L Nafion to make slurry solution.Then 0.4 mL slurry were dropped onto ITO slices to form a working electrode with an effective illumination area of 1 cm 2 after ethanol was totally evaporated.A 300 W xenon lamp provides visible light source through a cutoff filter (420 nm) for the determination of photocurrent.Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) and Mott-Schottky equation (MS) of samples were also measured in the three-electrode system under the dark state. 10 mg of the catalyst was sonicated and dispersed in 1 mL of ethanol solution, and then the suspension was dropped onto a glass slide (r 2 cm) to cover it uniformly to form a film.The prepared catalyst film and 5 mL of deionized water were placed into a sealed quartz glass container without direct contact between the sample film and the deionized water.A xenon lamp equipped with a 420 nm filter was used as the light source, and its average power in the light-receiving region was 71.33 mWcm 2 .Before starting the reaction, the sealed vessel is evacuated to remove the air, and then an appropriate amount of high purity CO 2 is pumped in and maintained at a constant temperature of 20 C with a circulating condenser pump.During the reaction, every one hour the system automatically extracts a quantitative gas into the gas chromatography (PGC-80, PANNA, CHINA), and using the FID detector for monitored and recorded of products.In addition, the 13 C isotope tracing experiment for MTCN-1 photo-catalytic system was conducted using the 13 CO 2 in situproduced from the reaction of NaH 13 CO 3 (96 13 C-labbed component) with 2 M H 2 SO 4 in the photo-reactor (See supporting information for specific operation).

In this work, density functional theory (DFT) is computed using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP).The conjugate gradient algorithm is used for optimization.These calculations were conducted using a projector-enhanced wave potential on the basis of the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange correlation function in the Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE) hybrid method using an exact exchange fraction of 0.25.The spin polarization effect is considered in this paper.The energy cutoff is set to 400ev and the projection enhanced wave (PAW) method is used.In consideration of the large slabs used in this study, a (2 2 1) Monkhorst-Pack grid was used for sampling the Brillouin zone integrals.The vacuum slabs of 12 A were adopted in the geometric model to avoid interactions between adjacent atom layers.The convergence threshold was set 110 -4 eV in total energy and 0.05 eV/ A in force on each atom.The adsorption energy change (E a ) was determined as follows: E a E total -E sur -E CO2 , where E total is the total energy for the adsorption state, E sur is the energy of pure surface, E CO2 is the energy of CO 2 . In-situ FTIR measurements were performed on a Bruker Vertex 70 FTIR spectrometer.Before conducting the experiments, the sample was placed in an in-situ cell and purged with N 2 to remove air, followed by that the in-situ cell was heated to 200 C and maintained at this temperature for 30 min and then cooled to room temperature under an inert atmosphere.Thereafter, the gas mixture of CO 2 and H 2 O vapour was continuously introduced into the in-situ cell until adsorbed by the sample to saturation (about 45 min).Finally, the in-situ adsorption FTIR spectrum was automatically recorded every 20 min by lighting a 5 W LED lamp focused on the catalyst in the in-situ cell."}, {"llm generation": "CN materials (MCN, TCN, MCNS, TCNS, MTCN-1, MTCN-x)", "source": "Fig. 3a gives the XRD patterns of these catalysts, in which the XRD patterns of MCN and TCN exhibit two characteristic diffraction peaks attributed to (1 0 0) and (0 0 2).", "context": "The C/N/O contents of some representative CN materials were measured by an organic elemental analyzer and the obtained results are shown in Table S1.The as-synthesized MCN and TCN from Me and AT have the C/N atomic ratios of 0.72 and 0.65, respectively, both of which are lower than the theoretical stoichiometric ratio of 0.75 (C 3 N 4 ), indicating that the small terminal amino (NH x ) groups exist in these two materials owing to the incomplete polymerization and the AT-derived TCN possesses a higher terminal NH x groups due to the introduction of triazole ring at the polymerized terminal.The MCNS and TCNS obtained by calcinating the above two CN materials in air fade to some extent (Insert of S1), along with the further reduction in their C/N ratios to 0.59 and 0.53.This may be due to the partial or even complete oxidation of the skeleton carbon atoms of the two CN materials during the calcination process, as supported by the detectable 1-3 mass elemental oxygen in MCNS and TCNS.And this oxidation perhaps results in a decrease of the ordered structure and the increase of defect sites 25.Notably, the MTCN-1 obtained by re-calcinating the equal mass mixture of MCN and TCN gives a C/N atomic ratio of 0.57 that is almost consistent with the average C/N atomic ratio (0.56) calculated from these two CN materials, suggesting that the two CN materials in the mixture still remain the respective re-calcination behaviours. The morphology and microstructure of the above materials were obtained by SEM and TEM characterizations and the recorded images are shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. S2.The SEM or TEM images of two pristine MCN and TCN generally consist of micron-sized blocky particles and present the obvious stacking morphologies of lamellas in the side of particles (Fig. S2).After re-calcination in air, the original blocky MCN particles are stripped into the thin lamellas with wrinkles and spongelike holes in the SEM image of MCNS (Fig. 1a).And the TCN particles are broken into tiny fragments that present a disorderly accumulated morphology and very rough surface in the SEM image of TCNS, along with the formation of a large number of holes caused by the oxidative etching of TCN particles (Fig. 1b).This is likely because the hydrogen bonds and van der waals forces between the tri-s-triazine layers to construct the blocky MCN and TCN particles are broken significantly under re-calcination in air, thus leading to the above changes in the morphology and structure.Notably, the SEM image of MTCN-1 can well inherit both the above typical morphological features for MCNS and TCNS, this seems to indicate that during re-calcination in air, the two CN materials in the mixture still maintain the respective morphological and structural evolution characters.However, the subsequent highmagnified TEM images reveal that the particle morphology of these re-calcined materials are different from each other.The nanoparticles (NPs) of MCNS present higher electronic transparency and uniformity and some clear grooves can be found in its photograph (Fig. 1d).The NPs of TCNS are relatively inhomogeneous in size and electronic transparency (Fig. 1e).This further supports that MCNS has thinner and finer lamellar debris stacking morphology than TCNS.Moreover, dynamic light scattering also confirmed that the NPs size of MTCN-1 was reduced by about half compared to MCN and TCN (Fig. S3).The NPs of MTCN-1 can be partly assembled to form a tree-like morphology hanging a lot of small pale NPs on the dark trunks and branches although there are still the NPs of MCNS and TCNS to be found in its TEM image (Fig. 1f), suggesting that the dark trunks and branches in MTCN-1 are likely due to the re-polycondensation among the MCN and TCN tiny fragments exfoliated by high temperature oxidation and this tree-like morphology should be beneficial to absorb light energy and especially to separate the photo-generated charge pairs.The High resolution (HR) TEM image of MTCN-1 displays two different types of NPs morphologies in the various regions (Fig. 1g), the NPs located in the high and homogeneous electron transmission regions have a vaguely discernible lattice stripe (0.327 nm, as shown in Fig. S4) attributed to 002 of MCNS phase, while other relatively rough regions are most likely TCNS phase particles, supporting the existence of homojunctions in MTCN-1.Due to the irregular shape and amorphous state of MTCN-1 NPs, it is difficult to accurately draw the heterogeneous boundaries.Besides, the energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) mapping of MTCN-1 confirms that the composite is still comprised of the two main C and N elements that are evenly distributed around each other, but there are very loose and non-uniform distribution of O element to be found in the mapping, supporting the existence of small number of O-containing groups in MTCN-1. Porosity of the above materials was measured using a low temperature nitrogen (N 2 ) adsorption apparatus and the obtained N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms and BJH pore size distribution curves are shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. S5.The isotherms of MCN and TCN in Fig. S5 have very slow-increase of N 2 uptakes without hysteresis at the whole relative pressure range, and the calculated BET surface areas (S BET ) and pore volumes (V p ) only have about 7 m 2 .g - and 0.05 cm 3 .g - , indicating that these two materials are almost nonporous.In sharp contrast, three re-calcined CN materials have very similar isotherms belongs to type II according to the IUPAC classification (Fig. 2).At low to moderate relative pressures (0-0.8), the isotherms have very slow-increase of N 2 uptakes without hysteresis.At high relative pressures, the isotherms exhibit fast-increase of N 2 uptakes with type H3 of clear hysteresis, which can be indicative of characteristic of slit-shaped mesopores 26.The BJH pore size distribution curves of these three materials in Fig. 2b, all displays a typical hierarchical pore character that consists of mesopores in 3-60 nm, the mesopores of MTCN-1 are mainly located in 8-32 nm and the mesopores smaller than 8 nm are much less than those of MCNS and especially TCNS.The porous parameters listed in Fig. 2a further reveal that MTCN-1 is slightly superior to MCNS and especially TCNS in surface area, pore volume and size.These findings support that the fragments exfoliated by the high temperature oxidation of MCN or TCN can gather to form richer slit-shaped mesopores with various sizes and this kind of pore forming effect can be strengthened in the coexistence of MCN or TCN fragments, which is favorable for the rapid transfer of photo-generated charge carriers from the interior toward the apparent, and these are desired for photocatalysis 272829. Fig. 3a gives the XRD patterns of these catalysts, in which the XRD patterns of MCN and TCN exhibit two characteristic diffraction peaks attributed to (1 0 0) and (0 0 2).One very weak diffraction peak at 13.7 (1 0 0) is attributed to tri-s-triazine ordered repeating unit in the plane of the skeleton, and another strong peak at 27.6 (0 0 2) is assigned to graphene-like interlayer stacking 30,31.The re-calcined three samples have very similar XRD patterns to MCN and TCN, indicating that the recalcination does not result in a change of the crystal phases.But the recalcination can lead to a reduction in the intensity of 002 and especially 100 peaks and a slight-shift of these two peaks toward smaller angle, indicating that the ordered structure of these re-calcined materials slightly decreases owing to the oxidative etching.The shift of (1 0 0) peak for TCNS and MTCN-1 can be explained by the decomposition of the triazole resulting from the re-calcination, thus constructing the larger etching pores in the planar structure.The shift of (0 0 2) peak indicates the re-calcination can expand the spacing of the CN layers, which corroborates the fact that the accumulated lamellar structure of bulk material are exfoliated into fewer layers 32.By Bragg equation (2dsin n, here n 1, 1.5406), the distances (d/nm) of intra-layer and inter-layer for these materials can be calculated based on the 2 values of (1 0 0) or (0 0 2) of XRD patterns.As shown in Table S2, the two d values for the three recalcined CN materials are larger than those for the precursors MCN and TCN and the two d values of MTCN-1 is the largest, further supporting the intra-layer and inter-layer spacing of MCN and TCN, especially the mixture of them, can be expanded by recalcination in air. Fig. 3b illuminates that the FT-IR spectra of catalysts are similar to each other and all show three kinds of typical absorption bands attributable to the graphite-phase CN materials.Among these bands, a sharp band at 810 cm -1 ascribes to the characteristic breathing pattern of tri-s-triazine.A series of IR bands in 1200-1750 cm -1 are assigned to the stretching modes of aromatic C -N and C--N bonds in the triazine and triazole 333435.It deserves to be noted that compared to the original MCN and TCN materials, the re-calcined catalysts commonly exhibit the enhanced IR bands in 1200-1750 cm -1 and their IR absorbance in 2950-3500 cm -1 become also strong, along with an enhancement of the C -O vibration band at 1090 cm -1 ,which can be indicative of the increase of amino and O-containing groups in the surface of these catalysts 25.These findings further support that the re-calcination of bulk MCN and TCN in air can be depolymerized into the tiny fragments by a chemical oxidation, thus releasing out the more amino groups and generating the O-containing groups.The fact that MTCN-1 has a slightly lower IR absorbance in 2950-3500 cm -1 than MCNS (Fig. S6) suggests that the re-polymerization between the terminal amino and O-containing groups of the depolymerized MCN and TCN fragments likely occurs in higher probability during the re-calcination of mixed MCN and TCN materials, which should facilitate to construct the heterogeneous structures and to improve the porosity in MTCN-1, as supported by the above characterization results. X-ray photo-electron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to investigate the chemical states for the surface elements of catalysts and the recorded high resolution (HR) XPS spectra for the surface carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and oxygen (O) elements are shown in Fig. 4, and more details listed in Table S3.The survey spectra in Fig. S7 affirm that all these catalysts consist mainly of C and N with a small amount of O.The C1s, N1s and O1s energy spectra of these catalysts in Fig. 4 or Fig. S8 are very similar to each other.From Fig. 4, the C1s fine spectra of MCNS, TCNS and MTCN-1 can be deconvoluted to four energy peaks by Gaussian simulation.The strong peak located at 288.22-288.24eV belongs to the carbon atoms in the sp 2 hybridized from triazine aromatic heterocycle (N -C--N).Two weak peaks located at 286.53-286.65 eV and 289.14-289.17eV are attributed to the aromatic C species attached with the amino (C -NH x ) 36,37 or hydroxyl (C -OH) 23,24 and the carbonyl carbon species 38, respectively.By the way, the energy peak at 284.8 eV is a typical of exotic impurities carbon (C -C, C--C).In the deconvoluted N 1 s energy spectra of MCNS, TCNS and MTCN-1, the strong peak located at 398.51-398.74eV corresponds to the sp 2 hybridized N in the triazine ( -C -N--C -), the peak located at 400.07-400.21eV originates from the tertiary N (N-C 3 ), and the peak located at 401.12-401.26eV is assigned to the amino group ( -C -NH x ) at the terminal 36,37.In addition, the above deconvoluted energy spectra all exhibit a weak satellite peak for C1s and N1s that can be traced to the - shock excitation in the CN heterocycle, further confirming the graphitized stacking structure of these materials.The O1s fine spectra of MCNS, TCNS and MTCN-1 display two energy peaks S3), supporting that the oxidation of amino groups may occur during re-calcination 25.Furthermore, the atomic percent of N1s of C-NH x groups in these catalysts present an increasing sequence of MCN TCN MCNS MTCN-1 TCNS, supporting that the amino content can be increased by recalcination and the introduction of triazole.These catalysts were further characterized by 13 C solid-state NMR spectroscopy and the results are shown in Fig. S9.The precursor AT exhibits two NMR peaks at 148 and 156 ppm, attributed to the C' (N2) and C' (NH) species of triazole, respectively 34.TCN and MTCN-1 display three peaks in their NMR spectra.The two NMR peaks at 156 and 164 ppm are assigned to the C (N3) and C (NH) species of tri-s-triazine 40, the third weak peak at 147 ppm is very close to that of C' (N2) in triazole, supporting the existence of triazole units in these two materials. In order to obtain the band gap energy (Eg / eV), the UV-vis diffuse reflectance (DSR) spectra of these catalysts were measured and the recorded DRS curves in Fig. 5a were treated to obtain the corresponding tauc plots.Fig. 5a reveals the absorption spectra of all samples show a straight line in the form of an exponential on one side of the absorption band, which is the inherent property of semiconductors 41,42.The strong absorption in 400-450 nm is caused by the - jump of the tri-striazine unit 43.The absorption edge of pristine MCN is about 450 nm, corresponding to a band gap of 2.77 eV (Fig. 5a Inset), which is consistent with numerous published studies 35,37,44.Compared to MCN, TCN has an enhanced intrinsic absorption and a lowered E g value (2.32 eV).Moreover, another Urbach-tail between 450 and 650 nm can be clear found in UV-vis DSR spectrum of TCN, inferring that the triazole in such catalyst contains more lone pairs expanding the conjugation system 45,46, which facilitates electron delocalization and induces the n- jumps 47.However, the characteristic absorption attributable to the n- leaps is not observed in the UV-vis DSR spectra of MCN and MCNS, which is due to a fact that the n- leaps for these two catalysts are prohibited in the planar symmetric structural unit 44.The intrinsic absorption edge of the re-calcined catalysts are blue-shifted, corresponding to increase their E g values to some extent, which is caused by the quantum confinement effect (QCE) of the nanostructures 27,28,48,49.But, differing from MCNS, TCNS and MTCN-1 preserve a relatively favorable response in the visible region (450-650 nm) due to the n- leaps of residue triazole. Meanwhile, DFT calculations were performed using Melon-type CN to further understand the energy band structures of these catalysts.The optimized geometries, as well as the corresponding energy band and density of state (DOS), are shown in Fig. S10 and Fig. 5b-d.The band gap energies of MCNS, TCNS and MTCN obtained from theoretical calculations are 2.95, 2.85 and 2.55 eV, respectively, which are in approximate agreement with the above experimental measurements and can be used for qualitative analysis.It is seen from the DOS diagrams that the valence band (VB) in there three catalysts consists basically of 2p orbitals of N, while the conduction band (CB) is mainly composed of 2p orbitals of C and N together.It will be observed from the frontier molecular orbital distribution maps that HOMO and LUMO in the catalysts are basically all distributed on the tri-s-triazine (Fig. 5e, f and Fig. S11).Notably, the frontier molecular orbital distribution is uniform in MCNS due to symmetric structure but is obviously relatively concentrated in TCNS due to the existence of triazole, which can be proved by the fact that the orbital electron density of TCNS is also significantly higher than that of MCNS (See the DOS diagrams).Interestingly, checking the frontier molecular orbital distribution map of MTCN reveals that the HOMO is entirely composed of MCNS phases, while the LUMO is all contributed by TCNS phases.This demonstrates that the theoretical band gap of MTCN should be constructed by the valence band top of MCNS phase and the conduction band bottom of TCNS phase. Fluorescence (FL) spectroscopy, as a forceful tool to study the recombination probability of photo-generated electron-hole pairs 30, was applied to the current photo-catalysts.As shown in Fig. 6a, under the excitation of 375 nm, MCN can emit stronger and more concentrated fluorescence in 420-580 nm than TCN.While the re-calcined TCNS and especially MCNS display the remarkably enhanced FL signals, along with a blue-shift of FL peak in TCNS.In sharp contrast, the MTCN-1 fabricated from re-calcining the mixture of MCN and TCN has the lowest FL intensity in all the catalysts.The separation efficiency of photo-generated electron-hole pairs can be significantly improved on MTCN-1 with a homojunction structure and high BET area, but it should not decrease on MCNS and TCNS with a small NP size and higher BET area.In order to explore other reason to lead to the enhancement of FL signals in these two re-calcined catalysts, the absorbance of catalysts on the excitation light was checked.As are shown Fig. S12.three recalcined materials are superior to the precursors MCN and TCN in the absorbance of excitation light, indicating that the re-calcination can enhance the excitation efficiency that contributes to emit FL signal.Therefore, the ratio of FL intensity to absorbance value was used to assess the FL efficiency that is closely relative to the stability of photoexcited states.It is seen from the ratio values in Table S4 that the FL efficiency follows the order below: MTCN-1 TCNS MCNS TCN MCN, indicating that the re-calcination plays good roles in improving the light harvesting and excitation quantum efficiencies. Photocurrent (PTC) measurements were carried out on the CN materials-fabricated work electrodes under xenon lamp light and the obtained PTC curves are shown in Fig. 6b.All samples present a fast, stable, and reversible photocurrent response.Among them, MTCN-1 presents the highest current density (up to 3.2 Acm 2 ), which can be indicative of the best photo-electric conversion efficiency.Also, MCNS and TCNS have higher photocurrent densities than the corresponding MCN and TCN.Further, the ability to transport the photo-generated charge carriers was investigated using the electrochemical impedance (EIS) technique under dark conditions.Fig. 6c shows the EIS-Nyquist plots for the catalysts, which can be well simulated to the equivalent circuit as illustrated in the inset, where R s and R es are the electrolyte and the interface (electrode / electrolyte) charge transfer resistance, respectively 50.The \"semicircle\" of the Nyquist curve is dominated by the charge transfer resistance, namely the magnitude of the semicircle reflects the R es value.Among the samples examined, MTCN-1 still has the smallest R es value, MCNS and TCNS have smaller R es values than the corresponding MCN and TCN.These findings further support that the recalcination can improve the photo-excited quantum efficiency of two single CN materials and especially the mixed CN materials. The relaxation time of the photoexcited states were analyzed through the transient fluorescence spectroscopy (TFS).Fig. 6d and Table S5 give the fluorescence decay curves and the corresponding fitting data, respectively.In general, the non-equilibrium charge carrier recovery consists of rediative recombination ( 1 ) and non-radiative migration ( 2 ) processes 31,51.As a whole, the average fluorescence life for the catalysts follows the order below: MTCN-1 MCNS MCN TCNS TCN.To be specific, the recombined time of charge carriers by a nonradiative way for both MCN ( 2 4.96 ns, Rel 29.86)and TCN ( 2 3.23 ns, Rel 22.62) is lower than that for MCNS ( 2 6.02 ns, Rel 31.27)and TCNS ( 2 4.06 ns, Rel 25.21), which reflects the advantage of the lamellar structure on the diffusion of charge carriers.MTCN-1 has a longest non-radiative energy transfer process ( 2 6.81 ns, Rel 36.74),further confirming its homojunction structure has an unique advantage in the separation of charge carriers. In order to elucidate the mechanism of accelerating the separation of charge pairs, we roughly analyzed the energy band position of catalysts.Firstly, the flat-band potentials (E fb ) of MCNS and TCNS obtained from the linear extensions of Mott Schottky curves 52 in Fig. 7a are -1.37 and -0.88 V (vs.NHE), respectively, The E fb can be approximated in most cases as the conduction band bottom energy level (E CBM ) 52 of ntype semiconductors (as verified by positive slopes in MS curves 53), while the difference between the E CBM and top of the valence band (E VBM ) namely is the band gap (E g ).In addition, Fig. 7b is the XPSvalence band spectrum, which reflects the energy difference () between the E VBM and the Fermi energy level (E F ). Consequently, the E VBM and E F values of MCNS and TCNS are calculated to be 1.65, -0.07 V and 2.07, -0.14 V, respectively.Finally, Fig. 7c presents the energy band diagram when MCNS and TCNS are in close contact to form a homojunction to reach thermal equilibrium.Since the E F of TCNS is more negative than that of MCNS, the electrons will flow spontaneous from the former to the latter until the E F of both are gradually flattened, forming an electron depletion and accumulation layer.Thereby, an electric field towards MCNS will be established at the contact interface.As a result, the interfacial electric field can guide the h and e -to migrate in the opposite direction during photo-excitation, leading to better performance in the charge separation.By the way, the gap and composition of band edge of MTCN obtained by derivation of experimental results are very close to the theoretical calculated by simulation, which proves the reliability of the corresponding energy band position. The photo-catalytic performance of these CN materials in the reductive conversion of CO 2 was investigated using a gas-solid phase photo-reactor under simulated sunlight irradiation.As shown in Fig. 8a, the CN materials examined are active for the photo-reductive conversion of CO 2 and providing CO as a main reductive product without any cocatalyst or sacrificial agent.Although the potential of CN is thermodynamically feasible for the reduction of CO 2 to CH 4 54, only small amounts of CH 4 is detected upon the re-calcined CN catalysts.It is clear that all the re-calcined CN materials are superior to the MCN and TCN precursors in photo-catalytic performance, among them, the composited CN materials (MTCN-x) all possess a relatively high catalytic activity.To be specific, after illumination for 8 h, MCN and TCN only achieve a poor CO yield (4.45 and 3.83 molg -1 ).The re-calcined MCNS and TCNS give a remarkably enhanced CO yield (25.40 and 21.31 molg -1 ), along with the generation of trace CH 4 (3.00 and 1.13 molg -1 ).Among MTCN-x, the MTCN-1 can achieve the highest CO 2 conversion with 0.36 AQE, and its CO yield (60.27 molg -1 ) is 13.5, 15.7, 2.4 and 2.8 times higher than those of MCN, TCN, MCNS and TCNS, respectively.Moreover, the high-abundant 13 C-labbed 13 CO can be detected out from the MTCN-1 photo-catalytic 13 CO 2 reduction by GC-MS analysis (See Fig. S13), and this isotope tracking experiment confirms that the reduction of CO 2 to CO exists in the current photo-catalytic system.The excellent photo-catalytic performance of MTCN-1 should originate from the reduced NP size and increased specific surface as well as homojunction by oxidative stripping.On the side, it was found that a simple mechanical mixture of MCN and TCN (mass ratio of 1:1) is slightly superior to any one of these two CN materials in photo-catalytic performance, providing 8.56 molg -1 yield of CO, which further illustrates the feasibility of constructing homojunction strategy on the CN precursors.Of great importance, MTCN-1 only achieves 4.18 molg -1 yield of H 2 from the photocatalytic splitting of water, indicating it has unique advantage in suppressing the competing hydrogen evolution reaction.And oxygen (O 2 ) is detected in the photo-catalytic system as well, implying that water oxidation occurred simultaneously during the photo-catalytic reduction of CO 2 .Moreover, the generation of O 2 in the MTCN-x-based photocatalytic systems is positively correlated with the TCN content until reaches a maximum value of 26.22 molg -1 at MTCN-0.67.For another, no detectable product after illumination if CO 2 is replaced by argon in the photo-catalytic system of MTCN-1, and MTCN-1 can maintains a relatively stable CO and CH 4 output even after five repetitions (Fig. 7b), which proving that MTCN-1 has a high stability. Besides, the photo-degradation of Tetracycline (TC) in aqueous was also investigated using the CN-based catalysts.As shown in Fig. 8c, the adsorption-desorption equilibrium of the catalyst in tetracycline solution was established under dark conditions for 20 min before the light up.After exposure to light for 2 h, the degradation rates of TC over MCNS and TCNS are 74.6 and 59.7, respectively.As for MTCN-1, this degradation rate can reach 95.6 under same illumination time, which is 3-4 times higher than those obtained using MCN (33.1) and TCN (21.6) as the catalysts. To gain more insight into the photo-degradation process and to provide guidance for subsequent analysis of h -e -pair migration pathways, the capturing experiments of active oxygen species in the photo-degradation of TC were therefore performed using the re-calcined CN materials as the catalysts.And Isopropyl alcohol (IPA, 10 mM), disodium ethylenediamine tetraacetate (EDTA-2Na, 10 mM) and pbenzoquinone (5 mM) were used as the quenching agents for hydroxyl radicals (OH), h and superoxide radicals (O 2 -), respectively.As shown in Fig. 8d, the addition of IPA in the TCNS-photo-catalytic system decreases the degradation rate of TC by 16.5, but this addition effect is almost negligible in the MCNS and MTCN-1 photo-catalytic systems.basically only generated in the TCNS photo-catalytic system. Regarding the superior catalytic performance of MTCN materials in the photo-reduction conversion of CO 2 , we speculate that the adsorb ability of MTCN materials to CO 2 also plays an important role in the preliminary step of photocatalytic process except the homojunctions.To prove this speculation, the adsorption of CO 2 on the surface of CN-based materials from 0 to 760 mmHg pressure was examined under room temperature, as shown in Fig. 9 and its Inset.TCN always maintains a slightly higher adsorption capacity for CO 2 than MCN in the pressure of CO 2 examined.Three re-calcined materials all exhibit the remarkably enhanced adsorption capacity for CO 2 , among them, MCNS is superior to TCNS in adsorbing CO 2 and the best MTCN-1 can give up to the adsorption value of 10 cm 3 CO 2 g -1 .The higher adsorption capacities of these re-calcined CN materials to CO 2 are undoubtedly benefited from the enhanced amino groups and BET areas, including a possible synergistic effect between TCNS and MCNS in MTCN-1. DFT theoretical simulation was further used to investigate the adsorption performance of CO 2 molecule on the above CN materials.Among the two adsorption modes of CO 2 on the catalysts reported by the literature, the parallel adsorption of CO 2 is superior to its vertical adsorption in thermodynamic stability 55,56, so that the parallel mode was used here.The parallel adsorption drawings of CO 2 on MCNS, TCNS and MTCN are shown in Fig. 10 and the calculated interaction energies (E a ) are -0.13,-0.21 and -0.50 eV, respectively, in which the more negative E a value corresponds to the stronger adsorption ability 57.This indicates the MTCN with homojunction is much superior to MCNS and TCNS in the adsorption capacity 57.Importantly, it can be seen from Fig. 10 .This forcefully supports that MTCN can induce CO 2 molecule to generate a much large deformation than MCNS and TCNS owing to its strong adsorption capacity to CO 2 , which corresponds to its E a .And the deformation of inert CO 2 molecule likely mainly originates from its adsorption 58 at the N atoms of catalyst that participate in both valence and conduction bands, which is very favorable for the subsequent reduction reaction. In situ FTIR spectroscopy is a powerful tool for monitoring the surface reaction process of catalysts, which was used in the present photocatalytic system.As are shown in Fig. 11. after the injection of mixed CO 2 and H 2 O gases, there is only the IR band of CO 2 adsorbed on the catalyst to be found in the dark state.After lighting on, the new absorption bands attributable to the reductive products of CO 2 start to appear and are gradually strengthened with duration of illumination.Among them, The two bands at 2081 and 2175 cm -1 are attributed to the multiple vibration modes of CO 16,59.Another bands 2884 and 2983 cm -1 are derived from the vibration modes of C-H in methane 60,61.In addition, two bands at 1519 and 1710 cm -1 correlated with monodentate carbonate groups (m-CO 3 2-) can be explained by the coadsorption of CO 2 and H 2 O 62,63.One band at 1553 cm -1 can be ascribed to the COOH, as a key intermediate in the reduction of CO 2 to CO 64,65.Also, other characteristic bands attributed to the CHO (1092 cm -1 ), CH 2 O(1367 and 2938 cm -1 ) and CH 3 O (1043, 1157 and 2828 and cm -1 ) groups are found, which are key intermediates in the reduction of CO 2 to CH 4 58,65,66.These findings forcefully confirm that the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 to fuels occurs on the catalyst surface and is a multi-step reaction process, including many intermediates such as formic acid, formaldehyde, methanol, etc.Although these products are not actually detected by GC likely due to low yields.Based on all the above photoreaction and characterization results, a reasonable mechanism for the current photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 is proposed as follows (Fig. 12): As shown in Fig. 6c, under visible light irradiation, the composite MTCN is excited to generate the carriers e - and h that are accumulated in the conduction band of TCN phase and the valence band of MCN phase, respectively.Then, the adsorbed H 2 O on the MTCN surface can be oxidized by h to produce O 2 and proton (H ) 25,31,46.Followed by that the H and e -react with the CO 2 species to form the COOH species and the latter can be further protonated to form the CO species.Most of the CO species can be desorbed from the catalyst' surface as the main product and the remaining part are completely reduced to CH 4 molecules.It is worth emphasizing that the reduction of CO 2 is a complex multi-electron transfer catalytic process 67."}, {"llm generation": "CN-based catalysts, MCN, TCN", "source": "Fig. 9.

In-situ FTIR measurements were performed on a Bruker Vertex 70 FTIR spectrometer.Before conducting the experiments, the sample was placed in an in-situ cell and purged with N 2 to remove air, followed by that the in-situ cell was heated to 200 C and maintained at this temperature for 30 min and then cooled to room temperature under an inert atmosphere.Thereafter, the gas mixture of CO 2 and H 2 O vapour was continuously introduced into the in-situ cell until adsorbed by the sample to saturation (about 45 min).Finally, the in-situ adsorption FTIR spectrum was automatically recorded every 20 min by lighting a 5 W LED lamp focused on the catalyst in the in-situ cell."}, {"llm generation": "UV-vis", "source": "Fig. 5.

The morphology and microstructure of the above materials were obtained by SEM and TEM characterizations and the recorded images are shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. S2.The SEM or TEM images of two pristine MCN and TCN generally consist of micron-sized blocky particles and present the obvious stacking morphologies of lamellas in the side of particles (Fig. S2).After re-calcination in air, the original blocky MCN particles are stripped into the thin lamellas with wrinkles and spongelike holes in the SEM image of MCNS (Fig. 1a).And the TCN particles are broken into tiny fragments that present a disorderly accumulated morphology and very rough surface in the SEM image of TCNS, along with the formation of a large number of holes caused by the oxidative etching of TCN particles (Fig. 1b).This is likely because the hydrogen bonds and van der waals forces between the tri-s-triazine layers to construct the blocky MCN and TCN particles are broken significantly under re-calcination in air, thus leading to the above changes in the morphology and structure.Notably, the SEM image of MTCN-1 can well inherit both the above typical morphological features for MCNS and TCNS, this seems to indicate that during re-calcination in air, the two CN materials in the mixture still maintain the respective morphological and structural evolution characters.However, the subsequent highmagnified TEM images reveal that the particle morphology of these re-calcined materials are different from each other.The nanoparticles (NPs) of MCNS present higher electronic transparency and uniformity and some clear grooves can be found in its photograph (Fig. 1d).The NPs of TCNS are relatively inhomogeneous in size and electronic transparency (Fig. 1e).This further supports that MCNS has thinner and finer lamellar debris stacking morphology than TCNS.Moreover, dynamic light scattering also confirmed that the NPs size of MTCN-1 was reduced by about half compared to MCN and TCN (Fig. S3).The NPs of MTCN-1 can be partly assembled to form a tree-like morphology hanging a lot of small pale NPs on the dark trunks and branches although there are still the NPs of MCNS and TCNS to be found in its TEM image (Fig. 1f), suggesting that the dark trunks and branches in MTCN-1 are likely due to the re-polycondensation among the MCN and TCN tiny fragments exfoliated by high temperature oxidation and this tree-like morphology should be beneficial to absorb light energy and especially to separate the photo-generated charge pairs.The High resolution (HR) TEM image of MTCN-1 displays two different types of NPs morphologies in the various regions (Fig. 1g), the NPs located in the high and homogeneous electron transmission regions have a vaguely discernible lattice stripe (0.327 nm, as shown in Fig. S4) attributed to 002 of MCNS phase, while other relatively rough regions are most likely TCNS phase particles, supporting the existence of homojunctions in MTCN-1.Due to the irregular shape and amorphous state of MTCN-1 NPs, it is difficult to accurately draw the heterogeneous boundaries.Besides, the energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) mapping of MTCN-1 confirms that the composite is still comprised of the two main C and N elements that are evenly distributed around each other, but there are very loose and non-uniform distribution of O element to be found in the mapping, supporting the existence of small number of O-containing groups in MTCN-1. Porosity of the above materials was measured using a low temperature nitrogen (N 2 ) adsorption apparatus and the obtained N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms and BJH pore size distribution curves are shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. S5.The isotherms of MCN and TCN in Fig. S5 have very slow-increase of N 2 uptakes without hysteresis at the whole relative pressure range, and the calculated BET surface areas (S BET ) and pore volumes (V p ) only have about 7 m 2 .g - and 0.05 cm 3 .g - , indicating that these two materials are almost nonporous.In sharp contrast, three re-calcined CN materials have very similar isotherms belongs to type II according to the IUPAC classification (Fig. 2).At low to moderate relative pressures (0-0.8), the isotherms have very slow-increase of N 2 uptakes without hysteresis.At high relative pressures, the isotherms exhibit fast-increase of N 2 uptakes with type H3 of clear hysteresis, which can be indicative of characteristic of slit-shaped mesopores 26.The BJH pore size distribution curves of these three materials in Fig. 2b, all displays a typical hierarchical pore character that consists of mesopores in 3-60 nm, the mesopores of MTCN-1 are mainly located in 8-32 nm and the mesopores smaller than 8 nm are much less than those of MCNS and especially TCNS.The porous parameters listed in Fig. 2a further reveal that MTCN-1 is slightly superior to MCNS and especially TCNS in surface area, pore volume and size.These findings support that the fragments exfoliated by the high temperature oxidation of MCN or TCN can gather to form richer slit-shaped mesopores with various sizes and this kind of pore forming effect can be strengthened in the coexistence of MCN or TCN fragments, which is favorable for the rapid transfer of photo-generated charge carriers from the interior toward the apparent, and these are desired for photocatalysis 272829. Fig. 3a gives the XRD patterns of these catalysts, in which the XRD patterns of MCN and TCN exhibit two characteristic diffraction peaks attributed to (1 0 0) and (0 0 2).One very weak diffraction peak at 13.7 (1 0 0) is attributed to tri-s-triazine ordered repeating unit in the plane of the skeleton, and another strong peak at 27.6 (0 0 2) is assigned to graphene-like interlayer stacking 30,31.The re-calcined three samples have very similar XRD patterns to MCN and TCN, indicating that the recalcination does not result in a change of the crystal phases.But the recalcination can lead to a reduction in the intensity of 002 and especially 100 peaks and a slight-shift of these two peaks toward smaller angle, indicating that the ordered structure of these re-calcined materials slightly decreases owing to the oxidative etching.The shift of (1 0 0) peak for TCNS and MTCN-1 can be explained by the decomposition of the triazole resulting from the re-calcination, thus constructing the larger etching pores in the planar structure.The shift of (0 0 2) peak indicates the re-calcination can expand the spacing of the CN layers, which corroborates the fact that the accumulated lamellar structure of bulk material are exfoliated into fewer layers 32.By Bragg equation (2dsin n, here n 1, 1.5406), the distances (d/nm) of intra-layer and inter-layer for these materials can be calculated based on the 2 values of (1 0 0) or (0 0 2) of XRD patterns.As shown in Table S2, the two d values for the three recalcined CN materials are larger than those for the precursors MCN and TCN and the two d values of MTCN-1 is the largest, further supporting the intra-layer and inter-layer spacing of MCN and TCN, especially the mixture of them, can be expanded by recalcination in air. Fig. 3b illuminates that the FT-IR spectra of catalysts are similar to each other and all show three kinds of typical absorption bands attributable to the graphite-phase CN materials.Among these bands, a sharp band at 810 cm -1 ascribes to the characteristic breathing pattern of tri-s-triazine.A series of IR bands in 1200-1750 cm -1 are assigned to the stretching modes of aromatic C -N and C--N bonds in the triazine and triazole 333435.It deserves to be noted that compared to the original MCN and TCN materials, the re-calcined catalysts commonly exhibit the enhanced IR bands in 1200-1750 cm -1 and their IR absorbance in 2950-3500 cm -1 become also strong, along with an enhancement of the C -O vibration band at 1090 cm -1 ,which can be indicative of the increase of amino and O-containing groups in the surface of these catalysts 25.These findings further support that the re-calcination of bulk MCN and TCN in air can be depolymerized into the tiny fragments by a chemical oxidation, thus releasing out the more amino groups and generating the O-containing groups.The fact that MTCN-1 has a slightly lower IR absorbance in 2950-3500 cm -1 than MCNS (Fig. S6) suggests that the re-polymerization between the terminal amino and O-containing groups of the depolymerized MCN and TCN fragments likely occurs in higher probability during the re-calcination of mixed MCN and TCN materials, which should facilitate to construct the heterogeneous structures and to improve the porosity in MTCN-1, as supported by the above characterization results. X-ray photo-electron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to investigate the chemical states for the surface elements of catalysts and the recorded high resolution (HR) XPS spectra for the surface carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and oxygen (O) elements are shown in Fig. 4, and more details listed in Table S3.The survey spectra in Fig. S7 affirm that all these catalysts consist mainly of C and N with a small amount of O.The C1s, N1s and O1s energy spectra of these catalysts in Fig. 4 or Fig. S8 are very similar to each other.From Fig. 4, the C1s fine spectra of MCNS, TCNS and MTCN-1 can be deconvoluted to four energy peaks by Gaussian simulation.The strong peak located at 288.22-288.24eV belongs to the carbon atoms in the sp 2 hybridized from triazine aromatic heterocycle (N -C--N).Two weak peaks located at 286.53-286.65 eV and 289.14-289.17eV are attributed to the aromatic C species attached with the amino (C -NH x ) 36,37 or hydroxyl (C -OH) 23,24 and the carbonyl carbon species 38, respectively.By the way, the energy peak at 284.8 eV is a typical of exotic impurities carbon (C -C, C--C).In the deconvoluted N 1 s energy spectra of MCNS, TCNS and MTCN-1, the strong peak located at 398.51-398.74eV corresponds to the sp 2 hybridized N in the triazine ( -C -N--C -), the peak located at 400.07-400.21eV originates from the tertiary N (N-C 3 ), and the peak located at 401.12-401.26eV is assigned to the amino group ( -C -NH x ) at the terminal 36,37.In addition, the above deconvoluted energy spectra all exhibit a weak satellite peak for C1s and N1s that can be traced to the - shock excitation in the CN heterocycle, further confirming the graphitized stacking structure of these materials.The O1s fine spectra of MCNS, TCNS and MTCN-1 display two energy peaks S3), supporting that the oxidation of amino groups may occur during re-calcination 25.Furthermore, the atomic percent of N1s of C-NH x groups in these catalysts present an increasing sequence of MCN TCN MCNS MTCN-1 TCNS, supporting that the amino content can be increased by recalcination and the introduction of triazole.These catalysts were further characterized by 13 C solid-state NMR spectroscopy and the results are shown in Fig. S9.The precursor AT exhibits two NMR peaks at 148 and 156 ppm, attributed to the C' (N2) and C' (NH) species of triazole, respectively 34.TCN and MTCN-1 display three peaks in their NMR spectra.The two NMR peaks at 156 and 164 ppm are assigned to the C (N3) and C (NH) species of tri-s-triazine 40, the third weak peak at 147 ppm is very close to that of C' (N2) in triazole, supporting the existence of triazole units in these two materials. In order to obtain the band gap energy (Eg / eV), the UV-vis diffuse reflectance (DSR) spectra of these catalysts were measured and the recorded DRS curves in Fig. 5a were treated to obtain the corresponding tauc plots.Fig. 5a reveals the absorption spectra of all samples show a straight line in the form of an exponential on one side of the absorption band, which is the inherent property of semiconductors 41,42.The strong absorption in 400-450 nm is caused by the - jump of the tri-striazine unit 43.The absorption edge of pristine MCN is about 450 nm, corresponding to a band gap of 2.77 eV (Fig. 5a Inset), which is consistent with numerous published studies 35,37,44.Compared to MCN, TCN has an enhanced intrinsic absorption and a lowered E g value (2.32 eV).Moreover, another Urbach-tail between 450 and 650 nm can be clear found in UV-vis DSR spectrum of TCN, inferring that the triazole in such catalyst contains more lone pairs expanding the conjugation system 45,46, which facilitates electron delocalization and induces the n- jumps 47.However, the characteristic absorption attributable to the n- leaps is not observed in the UV-vis DSR spectra of MCN and MCNS, which is due to a fact that the n- leaps for these two catalysts are prohibited in the planar symmetric structural unit 44.The intrinsic absorption edge of the re-calcined catalysts are blue-shifted, corresponding to increase their E g values to some extent, which is caused by the quantum confinement effect (QCE) of the nanostructures 27,28,48,49.But, differing from MCNS, TCNS and MTCN-1 preserve a relatively favorable response in the visible region (450-650 nm) due to the n- leaps of residue triazole. Meanwhile, DFT calculations were performed using Melon-type CN to further understand the energy band structures of these catalysts.The optimized geometries, as well as the corresponding energy band and density of state (DOS), are shown in Fig. S10 and Fig. 5b-d.The band gap energies of MCNS, TCNS and MTCN obtained from theoretical calculations are 2.95, 2.85 and 2.55 eV, respectively, which are in approximate agreement with the above experimental measurements and can be used for qualitative analysis.It is seen from the DOS diagrams that the valence band (VB) in there three catalysts consists basically of 2p orbitals of N, while the conduction band (CB) is mainly composed of 2p orbitals of C and N together.It will be observed from the frontier molecular orbital distribution maps that HOMO and LUMO in the catalysts are basically all distributed on the tri-s-triazine (Fig. 5e, f and Fig. S11).Notably, the frontier molecular orbital distribution is uniform in MCNS due to symmetric structure but is obviously relatively concentrated in TCNS due to the existence of triazole, which can be proved by the fact that the orbital electron density of TCNS is also significantly higher than that of MCNS (See the DOS diagrams).Interestingly, checking the frontier molecular orbital distribution map of MTCN reveals that the HOMO is entirely composed of MCNS phases, while the LUMO is all contributed by TCNS phases.This demonstrates that the theoretical band gap of MTCN should be constructed by the valence band top of MCNS phase and the conduction band bottom of TCNS phase. Fluorescence (FL) spectroscopy, as a forceful tool to study the recombination probability of photo-generated electron-hole pairs 30, was applied to the current photo-catalysts.As shown in Fig. 6a, under the excitation of 375 nm, MCN can emit stronger and more concentrated fluorescence in 420-580 nm than TCN.While the re-calcined TCNS and especially MCNS display the remarkably enhanced FL signals, along with a blue-shift of FL peak in TCNS.In sharp contrast, the MTCN-1 fabricated from re-calcining the mixture of MCN and TCN has the lowest FL intensity in all the catalysts.The separation efficiency of photo-generated electron-hole pairs can be significantly improved on MTCN-1 with a homojunction structure and high BET area, but it should not decrease on MCNS and TCNS with a small NP size and higher BET area.In order to explore other reason to lead to the enhancement of FL signals in these two re-calcined catalysts, the absorbance of catalysts on the excitation light was checked.As are shown Fig. S12.three recalcined materials are superior to the precursors MCN and TCN in the absorbance of excitation light, indicating that the re-calcination can enhance the excitation efficiency that contributes to emit FL signal.Therefore, the ratio of FL intensity to absorbance value was used to assess the FL efficiency that is closely relative to the stability of photoexcited states.It is seen from the ratio values in Table S4 that the FL efficiency follows the order below: MTCN-1 TCNS MCNS TCN MCN, indicating that the re-calcination plays good roles in improving the light harvesting and excitation quantum efficiencies. Photocurrent (PTC) measurements were carried out on the CN materials-fabricated work electrodes under xenon lamp light and the obtained PTC curves are shown in Fig. 6b.All samples present a fast, stable, and reversible photocurrent response.Among them, MTCN-1 presents the highest current density (up to 3.2 Acm 2 ), which can be indicative of the best photo-electric conversion efficiency.Also, MCNS and TCNS have higher photocurrent densities than the corresponding MCN and TCN.Further, the ability to transport the photo-generated charge carriers was investigated using the electrochemical impedance (EIS) technique under dark conditions.Fig. 6c shows the EIS-Nyquist plots for the catalysts, which can be well simulated to the equivalent circuit as illustrated in the inset, where R s and R es are the electrolyte and the interface (electrode / electrolyte) charge transfer resistance, respectively 50.The \"semicircle\" of the Nyquist curve is dominated by the charge transfer resistance, namely the magnitude of the semicircle reflects the R es value.Among the samples examined, MTCN-1 still has the smallest R es value, MCNS and TCNS have smaller R es values than the corresponding MCN and TCN.These findings further support that the recalcination can improve the photo-excited quantum efficiency of two single CN materials and especially the mixed CN materials. The relaxation time of the photoexcited states were analyzed through the transient fluorescence spectroscopy (TFS).Fig. 6d and Table S5 give the fluorescence decay curves and the corresponding fitting data, respectively.In general, the non-equilibrium charge carrier recovery consists of rediative recombination ( 1 ) and non-radiative migration ( 2 ) processes 31,51.As a whole, the average fluorescence life for the catalysts follows the order below: MTCN-1 MCNS MCN TCNS TCN.To be specific, the recombined time of charge carriers by a nonradiative way for both MCN ( 2 4.96 ns, Rel 29.86)and TCN ( 2 3.23 ns, Rel 22.62) is lower than that for MCNS ( 2 6.02 ns, Rel 31.27)and TCNS ( 2 4.06 ns, Rel 25.21), which reflects the advantage of the lamellar structure on the diffusion of charge carriers.MTCN-1 has a longest non-radiative energy transfer process ( 2 6.81 ns, Rel 36.74),further confirming its homojunction structure has an unique advantage in the separation of charge carriers. In order to elucidate the mechanism of accelerating the separation of charge pairs, we roughly analyzed the energy band position of catalysts.Firstly, the flat-band potentials (E fb ) of MCNS and TCNS obtained from the linear extensions of Mott Schottky curves 52 in Fig. 7a are -1.37 and -0.88 V (vs.NHE), respectively, The E fb can be approximated in most cases as the conduction band bottom energy level (E CBM ) 52 of ntype semiconductors (as verified by positive slopes in MS curves 53), while the difference between the E CBM and top of the valence band (E VBM ) namely is the band gap (E g ).In addition, Fig. 7b is the XPSvalence band spectrum, which reflects the energy difference () between the E VBM and the Fermi energy level (E F ). Consequently, the E VBM and E F values of MCNS and TCNS are calculated to be 1.65, -0.07 V and 2.07, -0.14 V, respectively.Finally, Fig. 7c presents the energy band diagram when MCNS and TCNS are in close contact to form a homojunction to reach thermal equilibrium.Since the E F of TCNS is more negative than that of MCNS, the electrons will flow spontaneous from the former to the latter until the E F of both are gradually flattened, forming an electron depletion and accumulation layer.Thereby, an electric field towards MCNS will be established at the contact interface.As a result, the interfacial electric field can guide the h and e -to migrate in the opposite direction during photo-excitation, leading to better performance in the charge separation.By the way, the gap and composition of band edge of MTCN obtained by derivation of experimental results are very close to the theoretical calculated by simulation, which proves the reliability of the corresponding energy band position. The photo-catalytic performance of these CN materials in the reductive conversion of CO 2 was investigated using a gas-solid phase photo-reactor under simulated sunlight irradiation.As shown in Fig. 8a, the CN materials examined are active for the photo-reductive conversion of CO 2 and providing CO as a main reductive product without any cocatalyst or sacrificial agent.Although the potential of CN is thermodynamically feasible for the reduction of CO 2 to CH 4 54, only small amounts of CH 4 is detected upon the re-calcined CN catalysts.It is clear that all the re-calcined CN materials are superior to the MCN and TCN precursors in photo-catalytic performance, among them, the composited CN materials (MTCN-x) all possess a relatively high catalytic activity.To be specific, after illumination for 8 h, MCN and TCN only achieve a poor CO yield (4.45 and 3.83 molg -1 ).The re-calcined MCNS and TCNS give a remarkably enhanced CO yield (25.40 and 21.31 molg -1 ), along with the generation of trace CH 4 (3.00 and 1.13 molg -1 ).Among MTCN-x, the MTCN-1 can achieve the highest CO 2 conversion with 0.36 AQE, and its CO yield (60.27 molg -1 ) is 13.5, 15.7, 2.4 and 2.8 times higher than those of MCN, TCN, MCNS and TCNS, respectively.Moreover, the high-abundant 13 C-labbed 13 CO can be detected out from the MTCN-1 photo-catalytic 13 CO 2 reduction by GC-MS analysis (See Fig. S13), and this isotope tracking experiment confirms that the reduction of CO 2 to CO exists in the current photo-catalytic system.The excellent photo-catalytic performance of MTCN-1 should originate from the reduced NP size and increased specific surface as well as homojunction by oxidative stripping.On the side, it was found that a simple mechanical mixture of MCN and TCN (mass ratio of 1:1) is slightly superior to any one of these two CN materials in photo-catalytic performance, providing 8.56 molg -1 yield of CO, which further illustrates the feasibility of constructing homojunction strategy on the CN precursors.Of great importance, MTCN-1 only achieves 4.18 molg -1 yield of H 2 from the photocatalytic splitting of water, indicating it has unique advantage in suppressing the competing hydrogen evolution reaction.And oxygen (O 2 ) is detected in the photo-catalytic system as well, implying that water oxidation occurred simultaneously during the photo-catalytic reduction of CO 2 .Moreover, the generation of O 2 in the MTCN-x-based photocatalytic systems is positively correlated with the TCN content until reaches a maximum value of 26.22 molg -1 at MTCN-0.67.For another, no detectable product after illumination if CO 2 is replaced by argon in the photo-catalytic system of MTCN-1, and MTCN-1 can maintains a relatively stable CO and CH 4 output even after five repetitions (Fig. 7b), which proving that MTCN-1 has a high stability. Besides, the photo-degradation of Tetracycline (TC) in aqueous was also investigated using the CN-based catalysts.As shown in Fig. 8c, the adsorption-desorption equilibrium of the catalyst in tetracycline solution was established under dark conditions for 20 min before the light up.After exposure to light for 2 h, the degradation rates of TC over MCNS and TCNS are 74.6 and 59.7, respectively.As for MTCN-1, this degradation rate can reach 95.6 under same illumination time, which is 3-4 times higher than those obtained using MCN (33.1) and TCN (21.6) as the catalysts. To gain more insight into the photo-degradation process and to provide guidance for subsequent analysis of h -e -pair migration pathways, the capturing experiments of active oxygen species in the photo-degradation of TC were therefore performed using the re-calcined CN materials as the catalysts.And Isopropyl alcohol (IPA, 10 mM), disodium ethylenediamine tetraacetate (EDTA-2Na, 10 mM) and pbenzoquinone (5 mM) were used as the quenching agents for hydroxyl radicals (OH), h and superoxide radicals (O 2 -), respectively.As shown in Fig. 8d, the addition of IPA in the TCNS-photo-catalytic system decreases the degradation rate of TC by 16.5, but this addition effect is almost negligible in the MCNS and MTCN-1 photo-catalytic systems.basically only generated in the TCNS photo-catalytic system. Regarding the superior catalytic performance of MTCN materials in the photo-reduction conversion of CO 2 , we speculate that the adsorb ability of MTCN materials to CO 2 also plays an important role in the preliminary step of photocatalytic process except the homojunctions.To prove this speculation, the adsorption of CO 2 on the surface of CN-based materials from 0 to 760 mmHg pressure was examined under room temperature, as shown in Fig. 9 and its Inset.TCN always maintains a slightly higher adsorption capacity for CO 2 than MCN in the pressure of CO 2 examined.Three re-calcined materials all exhibit the remarkably enhanced adsorption capacity for CO 2 , among them, MCNS is superior to TCNS in adsorbing CO 2 and the best MTCN-1 can give up to the adsorption value of 10 cm 3 CO 2 g -1 .The higher adsorption capacities of these re-calcined CN materials to CO 2 are undoubtedly benefited from the enhanced amino groups and BET areas, including a possible synergistic effect between TCNS and MCNS in MTCN-1. DFT theoretical simulation was further used to investigate the adsorption performance of CO 2 molecule on the above CN materials.Among the two adsorption modes of CO 2 on the catalysts reported by the literature, the parallel adsorption of CO 2 is superior to its vertical adsorption in thermodynamic stability 55,56, so that the parallel mode was used here.The parallel adsorption drawings of CO 2 on MCNS, TCNS and MTCN are shown in Fig. 10 and the calculated interaction energies (E a ) are -0.13,-0.21 and -0.50 eV, respectively, in which the more negative E a value corresponds to the stronger adsorption ability 57.This indicates the MTCN with homojunction is much superior to MCNS and TCNS in the adsorption capacity 57.Importantly, it can be seen from Fig. 10 .This forcefully supports that MTCN can induce CO 2 molecule to generate a much large deformation than MCNS and TCNS owing to its strong adsorption capacity to CO 2 , which corresponds to its E a .And the deformation of inert CO 2 molecule likely mainly originates from its adsorption 58 at the N atoms of catalyst that participate in both valence and conduction bands, which is very favorable for the subsequent reduction reaction. In situ FTIR spectroscopy is a powerful tool for monitoring the surface reaction process of catalysts, which was used in the present photocatalytic system.As are shown in Fig. 11. after the injection of mixed CO 2 and H 2 O gases, there is only the IR band of CO 2 adsorbed on the catalyst to be found in the dark state.After lighting on, the new absorption bands attributable to the reductive products of CO 2 start to appear and are gradually strengthened with duration of illumination.Among them, The two bands at 2081 and 2175 cm -1 are attributed to the multiple vibration modes of CO 16,59.Another bands 2884 and 2983 cm -1 are derived from the vibration modes of C-H in methane 60,61.In addition, two bands at 1519 and 1710 cm -1 correlated with monodentate carbonate groups (m-CO 3 2-) can be explained by the coadsorption of CO 2 and H 2 O 62,63.One band at 1553 cm -1 can be ascribed to the COOH, as a key intermediate in the reduction of CO 2 to CO 64,65.Also, other characteristic bands attributed to the CHO (1092 cm -1 ), CH 2 O(1367 and 2938 cm -1 ) and CH 3 O (1043, 1157 and 2828 and cm -1 ) groups are found, which are key intermediates in the reduction of CO 2 to CH 4 58,65,66.These findings forcefully confirm that the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 to fuels occurs on the catalyst surface and is a multi-step reaction process, including many intermediates such as formic acid, formaldehyde, methanol, etc.Although these products are not actually detected by GC likely due to low yields.Based on all the above photoreaction and characterization results, a reasonable mechanism for the current photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 is proposed as follows (Fig. 12): As shown in Fig. 6c, under visible light irradiation, the composite MTCN is excited to generate the carriers e - and h that are accumulated in the conduction band of TCN phase and the valence band of MCN phase, respectively.Then, the adsorbed H 2 O on the MTCN surface can be oxidized by h to produce O 2 and proton (H ) 25,31,46.Followed by that the H and e -react with the CO 2 species to form the COOH species and the latter can be further protonated to form the CO species.Most of the CO species can be desorbed from the catalyst' surface as the main product and the remaining part are completely reduced to CH 4 molecules.It is worth emphasizing that the reduction of CO 2 is a complex multi-electron transfer catalytic process 67."}], "reaction medium": [{"llm generation": "Liquid", "source": "Photoelectric current was measured in 0.5 M Na 2 SO 4 solution with 0.3 V bias potential by three-electrode system and CHI 650E workstation.", "context": "Powder X-ray diffractometry (XRD) was performed on Bruker D8 Advance and with an X-ray source of Cu Ka at a wavelength of 0.15406 nm and a scan range of 10-40 at 2 /min.Field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM) photos were obtained on Zeiss Sigma 300 at samples dispersion on silicon chips.Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were acquired by Titan G260-300 with the acceleration voltage set to 200 kV.UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectra(UV-vis DRS)were derived by a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-2550) fitted with an integrating sphere, and the spectrally pure BaSO 4 was used as a reference during the test, with a scanning range of 200-800 nm.Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of the sample was obtained by measuring the adsorption-desorption isotherm of N 2 with the aid of an ASAP 2020 specific surface meter.CO 2 adsorption was measured by an ASAP 2460 fully automated physical chemisorption instrument.X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were collected by Thermo Scientific K-Alpha using an Al Ka as the laser source, and all binding energies were corrected for the binding energy of surface adsorbed carbon (C1s 284.8eV).Transmission FT-IR spectra of the samples were recorded from 400 to 4000 cm -1 on a Nicolet Nexus 510P FT-IR spectra using a KBr disc with resolution of 1 cm -1 .Photoluminescence (PL) characteristic of samples was studied through Jasco FP-8300 fluorescence spectrometer.Transient fluorescence spectroscopy (TFS) of samples was carried out on an Edinburgh FlS1000 using EPL-375 as the excitation source.Solid-State Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (SSNMR) was performed on Brnker Avance II 400 MHz.
