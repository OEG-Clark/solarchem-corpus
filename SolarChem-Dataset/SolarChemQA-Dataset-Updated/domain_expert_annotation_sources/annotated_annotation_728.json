Figure 1b shows the HAADF-STEM image of Pt-Au/SiO 2 .The size of Pt NPs almost remains unchanged.From the HAADF-STEM images (Figure 1b and S7), Pt NPs were indeed deposited on Au NPs except those directly deposited on SiO 2 support, while not all the Au NPs were loaded with Pt NPs (Figure S8a).EDX mapping spectra (Figure S8) and HRTEM image (Figure S9) of Pt-Au/SiO 2 can distinguish Pt and Au NPs.It is noted that this Pt-Au contact aggregate structures are thermodynamically stable and Au-Pt surface alloy is difficult to form. 37,38 he crystalline structures of the catalysts were determined by XRD analysis (Figure 1c small size.But XPS (Figure 1d) and ICP-OES analysis (Table S1) of the catalysts can detect the presence of Pt.XPS data also show that Pt and Au existed in a metallic state when loaded on the SiO 2 support. 39,40 catalytic activities of the catalysts in DRM reaction with light irradiation (300 nm800 nm, Figure S11) at the same reaction temperature (673 K) are shown in Figure 2 and Figure S12.Clearly, without light illumination, the thermal-catalytic activities of Pt-Au/SiO 2 and Pt/SiO 2 were almost the same, while the Au/SiO 2 showed almost no performance in DRM reaction, which were in well agreement with our earlier report that Au could not activate the reaction of DRM. 28However, the reaction rates of Pt/SiO 2, Pt-Au/SiO 2 and Au/SiO 2 were all improved under irradiation of light.The reaction rates of Pt/SiO 2 and Pt-Au/SiO 2 exhibited a nearly linear dependence on the light intensity, and the increased slop of Pt-Au/SiO 2 was larger than that of Pt/SiO 2 .The linear dependence of catalytic activity on the light intensity agrees well with the mechanism of photoinduced reactions driven by hot electrons. 17,19,31 Te linear dependence also provides an indication that the localized heating, which usually induce an exponential dependence, is negligible in these reactions. 19Additionally, the reaction rates of Pt-Au/SiO 2 were clearly greater than the sum of the reaction rates of Pt/SiO 2 and Au/SiO 2 at the same light intensity.Under light illumination (0.6 W cm -2 ), the CO 2 conversion rates of Pt-Au/SiO 2 and Pt/SiO 2 were 68.6 and 46.6 mol g -1 min -1 , which were about 2.4 and 1.6 times higher than those of the thermal-catalytic process (28.8 and 28.5 mol g -1 min -1 ), respectively.Even without Na modification, the catalytic activity of Pt (No Na)/SiO 2 was also improved (Figure S13) under light irradiation.The catalyst undergone a little deactivation over 6 hours (Figure S14).The conversion of CO 2 over Pt-Au/SiO 2 in the photothermal process is around 0.3.It should be noted that CO 2 conversions were a little higher than CH 4 conversion and the sum of conversion of CO 2 and CH 4 is larger than the sum of yield of CO and H 2 because of the existing reverse water gas shiftreaction (CO 2 H 2 CO H 2 O) as side reaction. 13Meanwhile, the yields of CO and H 2 displayed similar increasing trends compared with the conversions of CO 2 and CH 4, and the mass balance was almost 100.From the above results, it could be speculated that Pt and Au LSPR might have coupling effect to facilitate the activation of CO 2 and CH 4 and improve the catalytic activities in DRM reaction. In order to demonstrate the observed photo-enhancement activities resulting from LSPR coupling effect of Pt and Au NPs, the impact of different irradiation wavelength on the catalytic activities of Pt-Au/SiO 2 and Pt/SiO 2 were performed (utilizing filters U340, L42B440, Y50B480, G545 and R68 to obtain the desired wavelength range, Figure 3a).By the irradiation of light, Pt/SiO 2 exhibited a broad SPR absorption from the range of UV to visible regions with a peak of around 275 nm (Figure 3a and S15). 41,42 otably, interband transitions of Pt NPs can also contribute to the visible absorption. 43While Au/SiO 2 displayed a strong SPR absorption peak centered at 520 nm (Figure 3a). 44terestingly, Pt-Au/SiO 2 also showed a broad absorption and two peaks locating at 275 and 520 nm (Figure 3a), combining the SPR absorption characteristics of both Pt/SiO 2 and Au/SiO 2, and the absorption intensity was remarkably enhanced and exceeded that of Pt/SiO 2 and Au/SiO 2. The catalytic activities of Pt/SiO 2 and Pt-Au/SiO 2 with the irradiation of different wavelengths of light were illustrated in Figure 3b.Clearly, the CO 2 conversion rates of Pt/SiO 2 and Pt-Au/SiO 2 were all improved under different wavelengths of light irradiation.Furthermore, the dependencies of the apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of Pt-Au/SiO 2 and Pt/SiO 2 on the wavelength of irradiation showed the similar trend to the light absorption spectra of Pt-Au/SiO 2 and Pt/SiO 2, respectively (Figure 3c and Table S2).Thus, it can be concluded that the observed activity enhancement was induced by the excitation of hot carrier.In addition, the AQE of Pt-Au/SiO 2 at the wavelength of 520 nm were higher than those at the other four wavelengths and higher than that of Pt/SiO 2 at 520 nm, indicating that surface plasmon and catalytic activity of Pt/SiO 2 were significantly enhanced by introducing Au NPs.It is also worth noting that plasmonic heating effect may also partly contribute to the enhanced activity, but due to the lack of accurate determination of the local surface temperature on Pt and Au NPs in this work, the relative contributions of hot carriers and plasmonic heating effect to the catalytic activity needs further investigation.All the above results suggested that the coupling LSPR effect of Pt and Au NPs both in UV and visible light range indeed promoted DRM reaction. To understand the mechanism of DRM reaction under light irradiation, the reaction kinetics test on Pt-Au/SiO 2 and Pt/SiO 2 in light and dark were carried out.Figure 3d shows Arrhenius-type plots for the CO 2 conversion rate versus temperature.The apparent activation energy (E a ) of Pt/SiO 2 (243.5211.31kJ mol -1 ) and Pt-Au/SiO 2 (241.3410.56kJ mol -1 ) are similar under dark condition (It is worth noting that the thermal activation energies of the catalysts were higher than those reported in other literature 13 , and the possible reason is shown in Figure S16).Intriguingly, the E a over Pt/SiO 2 and Pt-Au/SiO 2 decreased to 189.239.39 and 170.6910.28kJ mol -1 under light illumination, respectively.These changes in E a suggested that the coupling LSPR effect changed the energetics of DRM reaction. 45n order to reveal the underlying mechanism, FDTD methods were conducted to calculate the intensity of electric near-field of catalysts (see Experimental Section for the details of the FDTD methods).Figure 4 shows the electric fields distributions of the Pt-Au/SiO 2 , Pt/SiO 2 and Au/SiO 2 under light excitation of 350 and 530 nm.The enhancement of the intensity of electric fields (E 2 ) at the surface of Pt NPs in Pt/SiO 2 can be clearly observed (Figure 4a andd).The enhancement of electric fields intensity in Pt/SiO 2 at the 530 nm wavelength was larger than that at the 350 nm wavelength because the near-field peak for E 2 were red-shifted with respect to the far-field peak (absorption efficiency) (Figure S17), which was consistent with the previous report. 46While the enhancement of electric fields intensity at the surface of Au NPs in Au/SiO 2 at the 530 nm wavelength (Figure 4b) was greater than that at the 350 nm wavelength (Figure 4e) due to its plasmon resonance in the visible light region (Figure 3a).When Au/SiO 2 was loaded with Pt NPs, the LSPR of Pt-Au/SiO 2 system was located in the UV and visible region (Figure 3a andS18).The intensities of electric fields on Pt-Au/SiO 2 at the 350 and 530 wavelengths were significantly higher than those of Pt/SiO 2 and Au/SiO 2 (Figure 4c and f) , respectively, which could be explained by the strong near-field coupling between Pt and Au NPs.The generated strong electric fields yield high concentrations of hot electrons at the surface of the Pt and Au NPs.These electrons tend to be more energetic under thermal excitation (673 K) and might play a vital role in activating chemical bonds in chemical transformations. LSPR excitation can generate a large number of hot electrons at the surface of Pt and Au NPs.Hot electrons can directly interact with the adsorbed molecules (acceptor states), resulting in direct hot electrons transfer into the adsorbed molecules, which is proposed as the possible mechanism for plasmonic enhancement in the recent researches. 20DFT calculations (Figure S19) suggest that the excited electrons are distributed on the surface of CO 2 and CH 4 molecules (Pt-CO 2 or Pt-CH 4 clusters) while excited electrons are mainly distributed on the surface of Pt (Pt clusters).In other words, when the Pt-CO 2 or Pt-CH 4 clusters are excited by the light irradiation, hot electrons will transfer from Pt atoms to the adsorbed CO 2 or CH 4 molecules, which may be helpful for the cleaving of CO and C-H bonds.Therefore, the transfer of hot electrons to the adsorbed reactants plays a critical role in the catalytic mechanism via the activation of the reactants. To further determine how light influence the catalytic performances and examine the formed intermediate species in the reaction condition, the interaction between catalysts and CO 2 CH 4 were investigated at 673 K by DRIFTS.Figure 5 shows the infrared (IR) adsorption spectra of Pt/SiO 2 and Pt-Au/SiO 2 in dark and light conditions at 673 K under CO 2 CH 4 mixture.It could be seen that apart from the reactant gas phase contributions (CH 4 centered at ca. 3015 cm -1 , CO 2 centered at ca. 2349 cm -1 ), 47 several peaks can also be observed.The broad peak centered at ca. 1500 cm -1 is characteristic of carbonate types species adsorbed on the support at high temperature. 47The broad band at 2043 cm -1 is assigned to the CO stretch frequency of linearly bound, while the broad band at 1935 cm - 1 is characteristic of 2-fold bridges (bridge-bonded) CO species (CO) on Pt, 48 which can further desorb to form CO. In addition, the broad peak at 3500-3750 cm -1 is assigned to the surface adsorbed hydroxyl (OH) groups 49 and the peaks at 1309 and 1363cm -1 are characteristic of the adsorbed formate (COOH ) species. 50The above results suggest that the HCOO , CO and OH species are the main intermediate species in the process of DRM reaction.Moreover, the intensity of these peaks did not change with time in the reaction (Figure S20).Interestingly, the intensity of characteristic peaks of CO and 6B.h and i). 5152253 In these reactions, the dissociation of CH 4 are the main rate-determining step (RDS) in DRM reaction. 51,54 or the photo-thermal reactions, as the catalysts were controlled and kept at the desired temperature (673 K) even with irradiation of light (as shown in Figure S1c andd), the DRM reaction over Pt-Au/SiO 2 was also supposed to proceed via the thermally activated process (673 K).However, Pt-Au/SiO 2 shows a broad LSPR absorption band covering the UV-to-visible spectral range.Under UV-visible light irradiation, the LSPR of Pt and Au are excited and the electric field intensities at Pt and Au NPs surface are significantly enhanced due to the presence of plasmonic coupling effect of Pt and Au.The induced strong electric field can effectively make the Pt surface sites more active. 31"}, {"llm generation": "Au/SiO2", "source": "Pt and Au with different loadings were loaded on SiO 2 (BET surface area, 436 m 2 g -1 , see Figure S3) by impregnation and precipitation method and the actual Pt and Au loadings characterized by ICP-OES method were similar to the theoretical values (Table S1).", "context": "Pt and Au with different loadings were loaded on SiO 2 (BET surface area, 436 m 2 g -1 , see Figure S3) by impregnation and precipitation method and the actual Pt and Au loadings characterized by ICP-OES method were similar to the theoretical values (Table S1).Note that sodium ions (Na ) were added in the process of loading Pt, since the addition of sodium ions could stabilize the dispersed Pt NPs and improve the catalytic activity for DRM in thermal process (see Figure S4 and5). 35,36 he representative high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images of Pt/SiO 2 are presented in Figure 1a and S4, which clearly show that Pt NPs with an average diameter of about 2.0 nm dispersed on SiO 2 .Figure S6 present the representative HAADF-STEM and TEM images of Au/SiO 2 .The size of Au NPs was in the range of 10-30 nm.

To understand the mechanism of DRM reaction under light irradiation, the reaction kinetics test on Pt-Au/SiO 2 and Pt/SiO 2 in light and dark were carried out.Figure 3d shows Arrhenius-type plots for the CO 2 conversion rate versus temperature.The apparent activation energy (E a ) of Pt/SiO 2 (243.5211.31kJ mol -1 ) and Pt-Au/SiO 2 (241.3410.56kJ mol -1 ) are similar under dark condition (It is worth noting that the thermal activation energies of the catalysts were higher than those reported in other literature 13 , and the possible reason is shown in Figure S16).Intriguingly, the E a over Pt/SiO 2 and Pt-Au/SiO 2 decreased to 189.239.39 and 170.6910.28kJ mol -1 under light illumination, respectively.These changes in E a suggested that the coupling LSPR effect changed the energetics of DRM reaction. 45n order to reveal the underlying mechanism, FDTD methods were conducted to calculate the intensity of electric near-field of catalysts (see Experimental Section for the details of the FDTD methods).Figure 4 shows the electric fields distributions of the Pt-Au/SiO 2 , Pt/SiO 2 and Au/SiO 2 under light excitation of 350 and 530 nm.The enhancement of the intensity of electric fields (E 2 ) at the surface of Pt NPs in Pt/SiO 2 can be clearly observed (Figure 4a andd).The enhancement of electric fields intensity in Pt/SiO 2 at the 530 nm wavelength was larger than that at the 350 nm wavelength because the near-field peak for E 2 were red-shifted with respect to the far-field peak (absorption efficiency) (Figure S17), which was consistent with the previous report. 46While the enhancement of electric fields intensity at the surface of Au NPs in Au/SiO 2 at the 530 nm wavelength (Figure 4b) was greater than that at the 350 nm wavelength (Figure 4e) due to its plasmon resonance in the visible light region (Figure 3a).When Au/SiO 2 was loaded with Pt NPs, the LSPR of Pt-Au/SiO 2 system was located in the UV and visible region (Figure 3a andS18).The intensities of electric fields on Pt-Au/SiO 2 at the 350 and 530 wavelengths were significantly higher than those of Pt/SiO 2 and Au/SiO 2 (Figure 4c and f) , respectively, which could be explained by the strong near-field coupling between Pt and Au NPs.The generated strong electric fields yield high concentrations of hot electrons at the surface of the Pt and Au NPs.These electrons tend to be more energetic under thermal excitation (673 K) and might play a vital role in activating chemical bonds in chemical transformations. LSPR excitation can generate a large number of hot electrons at the surface of Pt and Au NPs.Hot electrons can directly interact with the adsorbed molecules (acceptor states), resulting in direct hot electrons transfer into the adsorbed molecules, which is proposed as the possible mechanism for plasmonic enhancement in the recent researches. 20DFT calculations (Figure S19) suggest that the excited electrons are distributed on the surface of CO 2 and CH 4 molecules (Pt-CO 2 or Pt-CH 4 clusters) while excited electrons are mainly distributed on the surface of Pt (Pt clusters).In other words, when the Pt-CO 2 or Pt-CH 4 clusters are excited by the light irradiation, hot electrons will transfer from Pt atoms to the adsorbed CO 2 or CH 4 molecules, which may be helpful for the cleaving of CO and C-H bonds.Therefore, the transfer of hot electrons to the adsorbed reactants plays a critical role in the catalytic mechanism via the activation of the reactants. To further determine how light influence the catalytic performances and examine the formed intermediate species in the reaction condition, the interaction between catalysts and CO 2 CH 4 were investigated at 673 K by DRIFTS.Figure 5 shows the infrared (IR) adsorption spectra of Pt/SiO 2 and Pt-Au/SiO 2 in dark and light conditions at 673 K under CO 2 CH 4 mixture.It could be seen that apart from the reactant gas phase contributions (CH 4 centered at ca. 3015 cm -1 , CO 2 centered at ca. 2349 cm -1 ), 47 several peaks can also be observed.The broad peak centered at ca. 1500 cm -1 is characteristic of carbonate types species adsorbed on the support at high temperature. 47The broad band at 2043 cm -1 is assigned to the CO stretch frequency of linearly bound, while the broad band at 1935 cm - 1 is characteristic of 2-fold bridges (bridge-bonded) CO species (CO) on Pt, 48 which can further desorb to form CO. In addition, the broad peak at 3500-3750 cm -1 is assigned to the surface adsorbed hydroxyl (OH) groups 49 and the peaks at 1309 and 1363cm -1 are characteristic of the adsorbed formate (COOH ) species. 50The above results suggest that the HCOO , CO and OH species are the main intermediate species in the process of DRM reaction.Moreover, the intensity of these peaks did not change with time in the reaction (Figure S20).Interestingly, the intensity of characteristic peaks of CO and 6B.h and i). 5152253 In these reactions, the dissociation of CH 4 are the main rate-determining step (RDS) in DRM reaction. 51,54 or the photo-thermal reactions, as the catalysts were controlled and kept at the desired temperature (673 K) even with irradiation of light (as shown in Figure S1c andd), the DRM reaction over Pt-Au/SiO 2 was also supposed to proceed via the thermally activated process (673 K).However, Pt-Au/SiO 2 shows a broad LSPR absorption band covering the UV-to-visible spectral range.Under UV-visible light irradiation, the LSPR of Pt and Au are excited and the electric field intensities at Pt and Au NPs surface are significantly enhanced due to the presence of plasmonic coupling effect of Pt and Au.The induced strong electric field can effectively make the Pt surface sites more active. 31"}, {"llm generation": "Pt and Au", "source": "In conclusion, we have demonstrated the coupling of Pt and Au LSPR effect for efficient CO 2 reduction in DRM reaction using UV-vis light illumination.", "context": "In conclusion, we have demonstrated the coupling of Pt and Au LSPR effect for efficient CO 2 reduction in DRM reaction using UV-vis light illumination.The plasmonic coupling effect reduces the activation energies and changes the energetics of the DRM reaction mechanism, with a reaction rate 2. photo-mediated reactions on plasmonic metal NPs by utilizing solar energy.

Figure 1b shows the HAADF-STEM image of Pt-Au/SiO 2 .The size of Pt NPs almost remains unchanged.From the HAADF-STEM images (Figure 1b and S7), Pt NPs were indeed deposited on Au NPs except those directly deposited on SiO 2 support, while not all the Au NPs were loaded with Pt NPs (Figure S8a).EDX mapping spectra (Figure S8) and HRTEM image (Figure S9) of Pt-Au/SiO 2 can distinguish Pt and Au NPs.It is noted that this Pt-Au contact aggregate structures are thermodynamically stable and Au-Pt surface alloy is difficult to form. 37,38 he crystalline structures of the catalysts were determined by XRD analysis (Figure 1c small size.But XPS (Figure 1d) and ICP-OES analysis (Table S1) of the catalysts can detect the presence of Pt.XPS data also show that Pt and Au existed in a metallic state when loaded on the SiO 2 support. 39,40 catalytic activities of the catalysts in DRM reaction with light irradiation (300 nm800 nm, Figure S11) at the same reaction temperature (673 K) are shown in Figure 2 and Figure S12.Clearly, without light illumination, the thermal-catalytic activities of Pt-Au/SiO 2 and Pt/SiO 2 were almost the same, while the Au/SiO 2 showed almost no performance in DRM reaction, which were in well agreement with our earlier report that Au could not activate the reaction of DRM. 28However, the reaction rates of Pt/SiO 2, Pt-Au/SiO 2 and Au/SiO 2 were all improved under irradiation of light.The reaction rates of Pt/SiO 2 and Pt-Au/SiO 2 exhibited a nearly linear dependence on the light intensity, and the increased slop of Pt-Au/SiO 2 was larger than that of Pt/SiO 2 .The linear dependence of catalytic activity on the light intensity agrees well with the mechanism of photoinduced reactions driven by hot electrons. 17,19,31 Te linear dependence also provides an indication that the localized heating, which usually induce an exponential dependence, is negligible in these reactions. 19Additionally, the reaction rates of Pt-Au/SiO 2 were clearly greater than the sum of the reaction rates of Pt/SiO 2 and Au/SiO 2 at the same light intensity.Under light illumination (0.6 W cm -2 ), the CO 2 conversion rates of Pt-Au/SiO 2 and Pt/SiO 2 were 68.6 and 46.6 mol g -1 min -1 , which were about 2.4 and 1.6 times higher than those of the thermal-catalytic process (28.8 and 28.5 mol g -1 min -1 ), respectively.Even without Na modification, the catalytic activity of Pt (No Na)/SiO 2 was also improved (Figure S13) under light irradiation.The catalyst undergone a little deactivation over 6 hours (Figure S14).The conversion of CO 2 over Pt-Au/SiO 2 in the photothermal process is around 0.3.It should be noted that CO 2 conversions were a little higher than CH 4 conversion and the sum of conversion of CO 2 and CH 4 is larger than the sum of yield of CO and H 2 because of the existing reverse water gas shiftreaction (CO 2 H 2 CO H 2 O) as side reaction. 13Meanwhile, the yields of CO and H 2 displayed similar increasing trends compared with the conversions of CO 2 and CH 4, and the mass balance was almost 100.From the above results, it could be speculated that Pt and Au LSPR might have coupling effect to facilitate the activation of CO 2 and CH 4 and improve the catalytic activities in DRM reaction. In order to demonstrate the observed photo-enhancement activities resulting from LSPR coupling effect of Pt and Au NPs, the impact of different irradiation wavelength on the catalytic activities of Pt-Au/SiO 2 and Pt/SiO 2 were performed (utilizing filters U340, L42B440, Y50B480, G545 and R68 to obtain the desired wavelength range, Figure 3a).By the irradiation of light, Pt/SiO 2 exhibited a broad SPR absorption from the range of UV to visible regions with a peak of around 275 nm (Figure 3a and S15). 41,42 otably, interband transitions of Pt NPs can also contribute to the visible absorption. 43While Au/SiO 2 displayed a strong SPR absorption peak centered at 520 nm (Figure 3a). 44terestingly, Pt-Au/SiO 2 also showed a broad absorption and two peaks locating at 275 and 520 nm (Figure 3a), combining the SPR absorption characteristics of both Pt/SiO 2 and Au/SiO 2, and the absorption intensity was remarkably enhanced and exceeded that of Pt/SiO 2 and Au/SiO 2.

To understand the mechanism of DRM reaction under light irradiation, the reaction kinetics test on Pt-Au/SiO 2 and Pt/SiO 2 in light and dark were carried out.Figure 3d shows Arrhenius-type plots for the CO 2 conversion rate versus temperature.The apparent activation energy (E a ) of Pt/SiO 2 (243.5211.31kJ mol -1 ) and Pt-Au/SiO 2 (241.3410.56kJ mol -1 ) are similar under dark condition (It is worth noting that the thermal activation energies of the catalysts were higher than those reported in other literature 13 , and the possible reason is shown in Figure S16).Intriguingly, the E a over Pt/SiO 2 and Pt-Au/SiO 2 decreased to 189.239.39 and 170.6910.28kJ mol -1 under light illumination, respectively.These changes in E a suggested that the coupling LSPR effect changed the energetics of DRM reaction. 45n order to reveal the underlying mechanism, FDTD methods were conducted to calculate the intensity of electric near-field of catalysts (see Experimental Section for the details of the FDTD methods).Figure 4 shows the electric fields distributions of the Pt-Au/SiO 2 , Pt/SiO 2 and Au/SiO 2 under light excitation of 350 and 530 nm.The enhancement of the intensity of electric fields (E 2 ) at the surface of Pt NPs in Pt/SiO 2 can be clearly observed (Figure 4a andd).The enhancement of electric fields intensity in Pt/SiO 2 at the 530 nm wavelength was larger than that at the 350 nm wavelength because the near-field peak for E 2 were red-shifted with respect to the far-field peak (absorption efficiency) (Figure S17), which was consistent with the previous report. 46While the enhancement of electric fields intensity at the surface of Au NPs in Au/SiO 2 at the 530 nm wavelength (Figure 4b) was greater than that at the 350 nm wavelength (Figure 4e) due to its plasmon resonance in the visible light region (Figure 3a).When Au/SiO 2 was loaded with Pt NPs, the LSPR of Pt-Au/SiO 2 system was located in the UV and visible region (Figure 3a andS18).The intensities of electric fields on Pt-Au/SiO 2 at the 350 and 530 wavelengths were significantly higher than those of Pt/SiO 2 and Au/SiO 2 (Figure 4c and f) , respectively, which could be explained by the strong near-field coupling between Pt and Au NPs.The generated strong electric fields yield high concentrations of hot electrons at the surface of the Pt and Au NPs.These electrons tend to be more energetic under thermal excitation (673 K) and might play a vital role in activating chemical bonds in chemical transformations. LSPR excitation can generate a large number of hot electrons at the surface of Pt and Au NPs.Hot electrons can directly interact with the adsorbed molecules (acceptor states), resulting in direct hot electrons transfer into the adsorbed molecules, which is proposed as the possible mechanism for plasmonic enhancement in the recent researches. 20DFT calculations (Figure S19) suggest that the excited electrons are distributed on the surface of CO 2 and CH 4 molecules (Pt-CO 2 or Pt-CH 4 clusters) while excited electrons are mainly distributed on the surface of Pt (Pt clusters).In other words, when the Pt-CO 2 or Pt-CH 4 clusters are excited by the light irradiation, hot electrons will transfer from Pt atoms to the adsorbed CO 2 or CH 4 molecules, which may be helpful for the cleaving of CO and C-H bonds.Therefore, the transfer of hot electrons to the adsorbed reactants plays a critical role in the catalytic mechanism via the activation of the reactants. To further determine how light influence the catalytic performances and examine the formed intermediate species in the reaction condition, the interaction between catalysts and CO 2 CH 4 were investigated at 673 K by DRIFTS.Figure 5 shows the infrared (IR) adsorption spectra of Pt/SiO 2 and Pt-Au/SiO 2 in dark and light conditions at 673 K under CO 2 CH 4 mixture.It could be seen that apart from the reactant gas phase contributions (CH 4 centered at ca. 3015 cm -1 , CO 2 centered at ca. 2349 cm -1 ), 47 several peaks can also be observed.The broad peak centered at ca. 1500 cm -1 is characteristic of carbonate types species adsorbed on the support at high temperature. 47The broad band at 2043 cm -1 is assigned to the CO stretch frequency of linearly bound, while the broad band at 1935 cm - 1 is characteristic of 2-fold bridges (bridge-bonded) CO species (CO) on Pt, 48 which can further desorb to form CO. In addition, the broad peak at 3500-3750 cm -1 is assigned to the surface adsorbed hydroxyl (OH) groups 49 and the peaks at 1309 and 1363cm -1 are characteristic of the adsorbed formate (COOH ) species. 50The above results suggest that the HCOO , CO and OH species are the main intermediate species in the process of DRM reaction.Moreover, the intensity of these peaks did not change with time in the reaction (Figure S20).Interestingly, the intensity of characteristic peaks of CO and 6B.h and i). 5152253 In these reactions, the dissociation of CH 4 are the main rate-determining step (RDS) in DRM reaction. 51,54 or the photo-thermal reactions, as the catalysts were controlled and kept at the desired temperature (673 K) even with irradiation of light (as shown in Figure S1c andd), the DRM reaction over Pt-Au/SiO 2 was also supposed to proceed via the thermally activated process (673 K).However, Pt-Au/SiO 2 shows a broad LSPR absorption band covering the UV-to-visible spectral range.Under UV-visible light irradiation, the LSPR of Pt and Au are excited and the electric field intensities at Pt and Au NPs surface are significantly enhanced due to the presence of plasmonic coupling effect of Pt and Au.The induced strong electric field can effectively make the Pt surface sites more active. 31"}], "light source": [{"llm generation": "UV-visible light", "source": "After that, the spectra were recorded at 673 K under CO 2 CH 4 Ar (1:1:2) mixture (10.0 mL min -1 ) in the dark and with the irradiation of UV-visible light (300800 nm, 0.6 W cm -1 ).", "context": "Preparation of Au/SiO 2 : Au/SiO 2 catalysts with different loadings were prepared with urea-precipitation method.In general, 1.0 g SiO 2 was added into 100.0mL of an aqueous solution of HAuCl 4 (0.51 mM) and urea (11.4 g).The suspension was maintained at 80 C with vigorous stir for 4 h, then centrifuged, washed, dried and calcined at 400 C for 4 h.The theoretical loadings of Au was 1.0 wt..

The crystallographic phases of as-prepared samples were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) method on an X'Pert PRO diffractometer with Cu K radiation.TEM and HR-TEM were employed on a FEI Tecnai G 2 F20 transmission electron microscope operated at 300 kV.HAADF-STEM images were taken on a JEOL 2100F microscope. The XPS spectra were analyzed on a Thermo ESCALAB-250 spectrometer using a The photocatalytic reaction was carried out at atmospheric pressure in a fixed-bed reactor system (the reactor system is home-made by ourselves, and see details in Figure S1).Typically, 20 mg photocatalyst was used for each test and was placed uniformly in the alumina cell (diameter 8.5 mm, height 3 mm).In the experiments, the Pt and Au NPs and the SiO 2 were in well thermal equilibrium with each other due to their good thermal contact.The temperature was precisely measured and controlled by a thermocouple and TC-1000 temperature controller (JASCO), conducting the resistive heater to mitigate heating induced by light irradiation and keep the catalyst at the desired temperature (Figure S1 c andd).LA-251 Xe lamp equipped with HA30 filter (remove the IR light) was used to provide the light energy input.CO 2 and CH 4 (the molar ratio of 1:1) flowed into the reactor at a total flowrate of 20.0 ml/min.Firstly, the catalysts were in-situ reduced in DRM reaction for one hour.After the catalytic reactions were carried out for one hour, the effluent gas streams were analyzed using gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with a thermal conductivity (TCD) and a flame ionization detector (FID) to gain the relative amounts of CO 2 , CH 4 , CO and H 2 .The DRIFTS analysis were measured at 673 K by a FT/IR-6300 system (JASCO Corp.), equipped with an insitu DR cell and a liguid nitrogen cooled mercury-cadmiumtelluride detector (MCT) (see details in Figure S2).The wavenumber resolution is 4 cm -1 .

The electromagnetic fields distributed around plasmonic Pt and Au nanoparticles were conducted using finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) methods (FullWAVE, Synopsys'RSoft).The dielectric functions of Rh, Au and SiO 2 were taken from the literature. 32 All calculations were carried out with VASP code based on the density-functional theory (DFT). 33The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) was used for the exchange-correlation energy.A plane-wave expansion for the basis set with a cutoff energy of 450 eV was employed.To the CO 2 /Pt and CH 4 /Pt interface models, we constructed a slab model containing a CO 2 or CH 4 molecule on a (111) Pt surface with five atomic layers, and a vacuum region of 20 A was included.551 Monk-horst kpoint meshes was used for the Brillouin-zone integrations of the slab model, respectively. All atoms, excluding the last two atomic layer of Pt, were relaxed until the residual force was less than 0.01 eV/A.In addition, the DFT-D2 method proposed by Grimme was adopted to describe the van der Waals (vdW) interactions. 34"}, {"llm generation": "UV-Vis", "source": "catalytic activities of the catalysts in DRM reaction with light irradiation (300 nm800 nm, Figure S11) at the same reaction temperature (673 K) are shown in Figure 2 and Figure S12.", "context": "Pt and Au with different loadings were loaded on SiO 2 (BET surface area, 436 m 2 g -1 , see Figure S3) by impregnation and precipitation method and the actual Pt and Au loadings characterized by ICP-OES method were similar to the theoretical values (Table S1).Note that sodium ions (Na ) were added in the process of loading Pt, since the addition of sodium ions could stabilize the dispersed Pt NPs and improve the catalytic activity for DRM in thermal process (see Figure S4 and5). 35,36 he representative high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images of Pt/SiO 2 are presented in Figure 1a and S4, which clearly show that Pt NPs with an average diameter of about 2.0 nm dispersed on SiO 2 .Figure S6 present the representative HAADF-STEM and TEM images of Au/SiO 2 .The size of Au NPs was in the range of 10-30 nm. Figure 1b shows the HAADF-STEM image of Pt-Au/SiO 2 .The size of Pt NPs almost remains unchanged.From the HAADF-STEM images (Figure 1b and S7), Pt NPs were indeed deposited on Au NPs except those directly deposited on SiO 2 support, while not all the Au NPs were loaded with Pt NPs (Figure S8a).EDX mapping spectra (Figure S8) and HRTEM image (Figure S9) of Pt-Au/SiO 2 can distinguish Pt and Au NPs.It is noted that this Pt-Au contact aggregate structures are thermodynamically stable and Au-Pt surface alloy is difficult to form. 37,38 he crystalline structures of the catalysts were determined by XRD analysis (Figure 1c small size.But XPS (Figure 1d) and ICP-OES analysis (Table S1) of the catalysts can detect the presence of Pt.XPS data also show that Pt and Au existed in a metallic state when loaded on the SiO 2 support. 39,40 catalytic activities of the catalysts in DRM reaction with light irradiation (300 nm800 nm, Figure S11) at the same reaction temperature (673 K) are shown in Figure 2 and Figure S12.Clearly, without light illumination, the thermal-catalytic activities of Pt-Au/SiO 2 and Pt/SiO 2 were almost the same, while the Au/SiO 2 showed almost no performance in DRM reaction, which were in well agreement with our earlier report that Au could not activate the reaction of DRM. 28However, the reaction rates of Pt/SiO 2, Pt-Au/SiO 2 and Au/SiO 2 were all improved under irradiation of light.The reaction rates of Pt/SiO 2 and Pt-Au/SiO 2 exhibited a nearly linear dependence on the light intensity, and the increased slop of Pt-Au/SiO 2 was larger than that of Pt/SiO 2 .The linear dependence of catalytic activity on the light intensity agrees well with the mechanism of photoinduced reactions driven by hot electrons. 17,19,31 Te linear dependence also provides an indication that the localized heating, which usually induce an exponential dependence, is negligible in these reactions. 19Additionally, the reaction rates of Pt-Au/SiO 2 were clearly greater than the sum of the reaction rates of Pt/SiO 2 and Au/SiO 2 at the same light intensity.Under light illumination (0.6 W cm -2 ), the CO 2 conversion rates of Pt-Au/SiO 2 and Pt/SiO 2 were 68.6 and 46.6 mol g -1 min -1 , which were about 2.4 and 1.6 times higher than those of the thermal-catalytic process (28.8 and 28.5 mol g -1 min -1 ), respectively.Even without Na modification, the catalytic activity of Pt (No Na)/SiO 2 was also improved (Figure S13) under light irradiation.The catalyst undergone a little deactivation over 6 hours (Figure S14).The conversion of CO 2 over Pt-Au/SiO 2 in the photothermal process is around 0.3.It should be noted that CO 2 conversions were a little higher than CH 4 conversion and the sum of conversion of CO 2 and CH 4 is larger than the sum of yield of CO and H 2 because of the existing reverse water gas shiftreaction (CO 2 H 2 CO H 2 O) as side reaction. 13Meanwhile, the yields of CO and H 2 displayed similar increasing trends compared with the conversions of CO 2 and CH 4, and the mass balance was almost 100.From the above results, it could be speculated that Pt and Au LSPR might have coupling effect to facilitate the activation of CO 2 and CH 4 and improve the catalytic activities in DRM reaction. In order to demonstrate the observed photo-enhancement activities resulting from LSPR coupling effect of Pt and Au NPs, the impact of different irradiation wavelength on the catalytic activities of Pt-Au/SiO 2 and Pt/SiO 2 were performed (utilizing filters U340, L42B440, Y50B480, G545 and R68 to obtain the desired wavelength range, Figure 3a).By the irradiation of light, Pt/SiO 2 exhibited a broad SPR absorption from the range of UV to visible regions with a peak of around 275 nm (Figure 3a and S15). 41,42 otably, interband transitions of Pt NPs can also contribute to the visible absorption. 43While Au/SiO 2 displayed a strong SPR absorption peak centered at 520 nm (Figure 3a). 44terestingly, Pt-Au/SiO 2 also showed a broad absorption and two peaks locating at 275 and 520 nm (Figure 3a), combining the SPR absorption characteristics of both Pt/SiO 2 and Au/SiO 2, and the absorption intensity was remarkably enhanced and exceeded that of Pt/SiO 2 and Au/SiO 2. The catalytic activities of Pt/SiO 2 and Pt-Au/SiO 2 with the irradiation of different wavelengths of light were illustrated in Figure 3b.Clearly, the CO 2 conversion rates of Pt/SiO 2 and Pt-Au/SiO 2 were all improved under different wavelengths of light irradiation.Furthermore, the dependencies of the apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of Pt-Au/SiO 2 and Pt/SiO 2 on the wavelength of irradiation showed the similar trend to the light absorption spectra of Pt-Au/SiO 2 and Pt/SiO 2, respectively (Figure 3c and Table S2).Thus, it can be concluded that the observed activity enhancement was induced by the excitation of hot carrier.In addition, the AQE of Pt-Au/SiO 2 at the wavelength of 520 nm were higher than those at the other four wavelengths and higher than that of Pt/SiO 2 at 520 nm, indicating that surface plasmon and catalytic activity of Pt/SiO 2 were significantly enhanced by introducing Au NPs.It is also worth noting that plasmonic heating effect may also partly contribute to the enhanced activity, but due to the lack of accurate determination of the local surface temperature on Pt and Au NPs in this work, the relative contributions of hot carriers and plasmonic heating effect to the catalytic activity needs further investigation.All the above results suggested that the coupling LSPR effect of Pt and Au NPs both in UV and visible light range indeed promoted DRM reaction. To understand the mechanism of DRM reaction under light irradiation, the reaction kinetics test on Pt-Au/SiO 2 and Pt/SiO 2 in light and dark were carried out.Figure 3d shows Arrhenius-type plots for the CO 2 conversion rate versus temperature.The apparent activation energy (E a ) of Pt/SiO 2 (243.5211.31kJ mol -1 ) and Pt-Au/SiO 2 (241.3410.56kJ mol -1 ) are similar under dark condition (It is worth noting that the thermal activation energies of the catalysts were higher than those reported in other literature 13 , and the possible reason is shown in Figure S16).Intriguingly, the E a over Pt/SiO 2 and Pt-Au/SiO 2 decreased to 189.239.39 and 170.6910.28kJ mol -1 under light illumination, respectively.These changes in E a suggested that the coupling LSPR effect changed the energetics of DRM reaction. 45n order to reveal the underlying mechanism, FDTD methods were conducted to calculate the intensity of electric near-field of catalysts (see Experimental Section for the details of the FDTD methods).Figure 4 shows the electric fields distributions of the Pt-Au/SiO 2 , Pt/SiO 2 and Au/SiO 2 under light excitation of 350 and 530 nm.The enhancement of the intensity of electric fields (E 2 ) at the surface of Pt NPs in Pt/SiO 2 can be clearly observed (Figure 4a andd).The enhancement of electric fields intensity in Pt/SiO 2 at the 530 nm wavelength was larger than that at the 350 nm wavelength because the near-field peak for E 2 were red-shifted with respect to the far-field peak (absorption efficiency) (Figure S17), which was consistent with the previous report. 46While the enhancement of electric fields intensity at the surface of Au NPs in Au/SiO 2 at the 530 nm wavelength (Figure 4b) was greater than that at the 350 nm wavelength (Figure 4e) due to its plasmon resonance in the visible light region (Figure 3a).When Au/SiO 2 was loaded with Pt NPs, the LSPR of Pt-Au/SiO 2 system was located in the UV and visible region (Figure 3a andS18).The intensities of electric fields on Pt-Au/SiO 2 at the 350 and 530 wavelengths were significantly higher than those of Pt/SiO 2 and Au/SiO 2 (Figure 4c and f) , respectively, which could be explained by the strong near-field coupling between Pt and Au NPs.The generated strong electric fields yield high concentrations of hot electrons at the surface of the Pt and Au NPs.These electrons tend to be more energetic under thermal excitation (673 K) and might play a vital role in activating chemical bonds in chemical transformations. LSPR excitation can generate a large number of hot electrons at the surface of Pt and Au NPs.Hot electrons can directly interact with the adsorbed molecules (acceptor states), resulting in direct hot electrons transfer into the adsorbed molecules, which is proposed as the possible mechanism for plasmonic enhancement in the recent researches. 20DFT calculations (Figure S19) suggest that the excited electrons are distributed on the surface of CO 2 and CH 4 molecules (Pt-CO 2 or Pt-CH 4 clusters) while excited electrons are mainly distributed on the surface of Pt (Pt clusters).In other words, when the Pt-CO 2 or Pt-CH 4 clusters are excited by the light irradiation, hot electrons will transfer from Pt atoms to the adsorbed CO 2 or CH 4 molecules, which may be helpful for the cleaving of CO and C-H bonds.Therefore, the transfer of hot electrons to the adsorbed reactants plays a critical role in the catalytic mechanism via the activation of the reactants. To further determine how light influence the catalytic performances and examine the formed intermediate species in the reaction condition, the interaction between catalysts and CO 2 CH 4 were investigated at 673 K by DRIFTS.Figure 5 shows the infrared (IR) adsorption spectra of Pt/SiO 2 and Pt-Au/SiO 2 in dark and light conditions at 673 K under CO 2 CH 4 mixture.It could be seen that apart from the reactant gas phase contributions (CH 4 centered at ca. 3015 cm -1 , CO 2 centered at ca. 2349 cm -1 ), 47 several peaks can also be observed.The broad peak centered at ca. 1500 cm -1 is characteristic of carbonate types species adsorbed on the support at high temperature. 47The broad band at 2043 cm -1 is assigned to the CO stretch frequency of linearly bound, while the broad band at 1935 cm - 1 is characteristic of 2-fold bridges (bridge-bonded) CO species (CO) on Pt, 48 which can further desorb to form CO. In addition, the broad peak at 3500-3750 cm -1 is assigned to the surface adsorbed hydroxyl (OH) groups 49 and the peaks at 1309 and 1363cm -1 are characteristic of the adsorbed formate (COOH ) species. 50The above results suggest that the HCOO , CO and OH species are the main intermediate species in the process of DRM reaction.Moreover, the intensity of these peaks did not change with time in the reaction (Figure S20).Interestingly, the intensity of characteristic peaks of CO and 6B.h and i). 5152253 In these reactions, the dissociation of CH 4 are the main rate-determining step (RDS) in DRM reaction. 51,54 or the photo-thermal reactions, as the catalysts were controlled and kept at the desired temperature (673 K) even with irradiation of light (as shown in Figure S1c andd), the DRM reaction over Pt-Au/SiO 2 was also supposed to proceed via the thermally activated process (673 K).However, Pt-Au/SiO 2 shows a broad LSPR absorption band covering the UV-to-visible spectral range.Under UV-visible light irradiation, the LSPR of Pt and Au are excited and the electric field intensities at Pt and Au NPs surface are significantly enhanced due to the presence of plasmonic coupling effect of Pt and Au.The induced strong electric field can effectively make the Pt surface sites more active. 31"}, {"llm generation": "UV-Vis", "source": "By the irradiation of light, Pt/SiO 2 exhibited a broad SPR absorption from the range of UV to visible regions with a peak of around 275 nm (Figure 3a and S15).", "context": "Pt and Au with different loadings were loaded on SiO 2 (BET surface area, 436 m 2 g -1 , see Figure S3) by impregnation and precipitation method and the actual Pt and Au loadings characterized by ICP-OES method were similar to the theoretical values (Table S1).Note that sodium ions (Na ) were added in the process of loading Pt, since the addition of sodium ions could stabilize the dispersed Pt NPs and improve the catalytic activity for DRM in thermal process (see Figure S4 and5). 35,36 he representative high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images of Pt/SiO 2 are presented in Figure 1a and S4, which clearly show that Pt NPs with an average diameter of about 2.0 nm dispersed on SiO 2 .Figure S6 present the representative HAADF-STEM and TEM images of Au/SiO 2 .The size of Au NPs was in the range of 10-30 nm.

LSPR excitation can generate a large number of hot electrons at the surface of Pt and Au NPs.Hot electrons can directly interact with the adsorbed molecules (acceptor states), resulting in direct hot electrons transfer into the adsorbed molecules, which is proposed as the possible mechanism for plasmonic enhancement in the recent researches. 20DFT calculations (Figure S19) suggest that the excited electrons are distributed on the surface of CO 2 and CH 4 molecules (Pt-CO 2 or Pt-CH 4 clusters) while excited electrons are mainly distributed on the surface of Pt (Pt clusters).In other words, when the Pt-CO 2 or Pt-CH 4 clusters are excited by the light irradiation, hot electrons will transfer from Pt atoms to the adsorbed CO 2 or CH 4 molecules, which may be helpful for the cleaving of CO and C-H bonds.Therefore, the transfer of hot electrons to the adsorbed reactants plays a critical role in the catalytic mechanism via the activation of the reactants. To further determine how light influence the catalytic performances and examine the formed intermediate species in the reaction condition, the interaction between catalysts and CO 2 CH 4 were investigated at 673 K by DRIFTS.Figure 5 shows the infrared (IR) adsorption spectra of Pt/SiO 2 and Pt-Au/SiO 2 in dark and light conditions at 673 K under CO 2 CH 4 mixture.It could be seen that apart from the reactant gas phase contributions (CH 4 centered at ca. 3015 cm -1 , CO 2 centered at ca. 2349 cm -1 ), 47 several peaks can also be observed.The broad peak centered at ca. 1500 cm -1 is characteristic of carbonate types species adsorbed on the support at high temperature. 47The broad band at 2043 cm -1 is assigned to the CO stretch frequency of linearly bound, while the broad band at 1935 cm - 1 is characteristic of 2-fold bridges (bridge-bonded) CO species (CO) on Pt, 48 which can further desorb to form CO. In addition, the broad peak at 3500-3750 cm -1 is assigned to the surface adsorbed hydroxyl (OH) groups 49 and the peaks at 1309 and 1363cm -1 are characteristic of the adsorbed formate (COOH ) species. 50The above results suggest that the HCOO , CO and OH species are the main intermediate species in the process of DRM reaction.Moreover, the intensity of these peaks did not change with time in the reaction (Figure S20).Interestingly, the intensity of characteristic peaks of CO and 6B.h and i). 5152253 In these reactions, the dissociation of CH 4 are the main rate-determining step (RDS) in DRM reaction. 51,54 or the photo-thermal reactions, as the catalysts were controlled and kept at the desired temperature (673 K) even with irradiation of light (as shown in Figure S1c andd), the DRM reaction over Pt-Au/SiO 2 was also supposed to proceed via the thermally activated process (673 K).However, Pt-Au/SiO 2 shows a broad LSPR absorption band covering the UV-to-visible spectral range.Under UV-visible light irradiation, the LSPR of Pt and Au are excited and the electric field intensities at Pt and Au NPs surface are significantly enhanced due to the presence of plasmonic coupling effect of Pt and Au.The induced strong electric field can effectively make the Pt surface sites more active. 31"}, {"llm generation": "Monochromatic", "source": "Figure 4 shows the electric fields distributions of the Pt-Au/SiO 2 , Pt/SiO 2 and Au/SiO 2 under light excitation of 350 and 530 nm.", "context": "Pt and Au with different loadings were loaded on SiO 2 (BET surface area, 436 m 2 g -1 , see Figure S3) by impregnation and precipitation method and the actual Pt and Au loadings characterized by ICP-OES method were similar to the theoretical values (Table S1).Note that sodium ions (Na ) were added in the process of loading Pt, since the addition of sodium ions could stabilize the dispersed Pt NPs and improve the catalytic activity for DRM in thermal process (see Figure S4 and5). 35,36 he representative high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images of Pt/SiO 2 are presented in Figure 1a and S4, which clearly show that Pt NPs with an average diameter of about 2.0 nm dispersed on SiO 2 .Figure S6 present the representative HAADF-STEM and TEM images of Au/SiO 2 .The size of Au NPs was in the range of 10-30 nm. Figure 1b shows the HAADF-STEM image of Pt-Au/SiO 2 .The size of Pt NPs almost remains unchanged.From the HAADF-STEM images (Figure 1b and S7), Pt NPs were indeed deposited on Au NPs except those directly deposited on SiO 2 support, while not all the Au NPs were loaded with Pt NPs (Figure S8a).EDX mapping spectra (Figure S8) and HRTEM image (Figure S9) of Pt-Au/SiO 2 can distinguish Pt and Au NPs.It is noted that this Pt-Au contact aggregate structures are thermodynamically stable and Au-Pt surface alloy is difficult to form. 37,38 he crystalline structures of the catalysts were determined by XRD analysis (Figure 1c small size.But XPS (Figure 1d) and ICP-OES analysis (Table S1) of the catalysts can detect the presence of Pt.XPS data also show that Pt and Au existed in a metallic state when loaded on the SiO 2 support. 39,40 catalytic activities of the catalysts in DRM reaction with light irradiation (300 nm800 nm, Figure S11) at the same reaction temperature (673 K) are shown in Figure 2 and Figure S12.Clearly, without light illumination, the thermal-catalytic activities of Pt-Au/SiO 2 and Pt/SiO 2 were almost the same, while the Au/SiO 2 showed almost no performance in DRM reaction, which were in well agreement with our earlier report that Au could not activate the reaction of DRM. 28However, the reaction rates of Pt/SiO 2, Pt-Au/SiO 2 and Au/SiO 2 were all improved under irradiation of light.The reaction rates of Pt/SiO 2 and Pt-Au/SiO 2 exhibited a nearly linear dependence on the light intensity, and the increased slop of Pt-Au/SiO 2 was larger than that of Pt/SiO 2 .The linear dependence of catalytic activity on the light intensity agrees well with the mechanism of photoinduced reactions driven by hot electrons. 17,19,31 Te linear dependence also provides an indication that the localized heating, which usually induce an exponential dependence, is negligible in these reactions. 19Additionally, the reaction rates of Pt-Au/SiO 2 were clearly greater than the sum of the reaction rates of Pt/SiO 2 and Au/SiO 2 at the same light intensity.Under light illumination (0.6 W cm -2 ), the CO 2 conversion rates of Pt-Au/SiO 2 and Pt/SiO 2 were 68.6 and 46.6 mol g -1 min -1 , which were about 2.4 and 1.6 times higher than those of the thermal-catalytic process (28.8 and 28.5 mol g -1 min -1 ), respectively.Even without Na modification, the catalytic activity of Pt (No Na)/SiO 2 was also improved (Figure S13) under light irradiation.The catalyst undergone a little deactivation over 6 hours (Figure S14).The conversion of CO 2 over Pt-Au/SiO 2 in the photothermal process is around 0.3.It should be noted that CO 2 conversions were a little higher than CH 4 conversion and the sum of conversion of CO 2 and CH 4 is larger than the sum of yield of CO and H 2 because of the existing reverse water gas shiftreaction (CO 2 H 2 CO H 2 O) as side reaction. 13Meanwhile, the yields of CO and H 2 displayed similar increasing trends compared with the conversions of CO 2 and CH 4, and the mass balance was almost 100.From the above results, it could be speculated that Pt and Au LSPR might have coupling effect to facilitate the activation of CO 2 and CH 4 and improve the catalytic activities in DRM reaction. In order to demonstrate the observed photo-enhancement activities resulting from LSPR coupling effect of Pt and Au NPs, the impact of different irradiation wavelength on the catalytic activities of Pt-Au/SiO 2 and Pt/SiO 2 were performed (utilizing filters U340, L42B440, Y50B480, G545 and R68 to obtain the desired wavelength range, Figure 3a).By the irradiation of light, Pt/SiO 2 exhibited a broad SPR absorption from the range of UV to visible regions with a peak of around 275 nm (Figure 3a and S15). 41,42 otably, interband transitions of Pt NPs can also contribute to the visible absorption. 43While Au/SiO 2 displayed a strong SPR absorption peak centered at 520 nm (Figure 3a). 44terestingly, Pt-Au/SiO 2 also showed a broad absorption and two peaks locating at 275 and 520 nm (Figure 3a), combining the SPR absorption characteristics of both Pt/SiO 2 and Au/SiO 2, and the absorption intensity was remarkably enhanced and exceeded that of Pt/SiO 2 and Au/SiO 2. The catalytic activities of Pt/SiO 2 and Pt-Au/SiO 2 with the irradiation of different wavelengths of light were illustrated in Figure 3b.Clearly, the CO 2 conversion rates of Pt/SiO 2 and Pt-Au/SiO 2 were all improved under different wavelengths of light irradiation.Furthermore, the dependencies of the apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of Pt-Au/SiO 2 and Pt/SiO 2 on the wavelength of irradiation showed the similar trend to the light absorption spectra of Pt-Au/SiO 2 and Pt/SiO 2, respectively (Figure 3c and Table S2).Thus, it can be concluded that the observed activity enhancement was induced by the excitation of hot carrier.In addition, the AQE of Pt-Au/SiO 2 at the wavelength of 520 nm were higher than those at the other four wavelengths and higher than that of Pt/SiO 2 at 520 nm, indicating that surface plasmon and catalytic activity of Pt/SiO 2 were significantly enhanced by introducing Au NPs.It is also worth noting that plasmonic heating effect may also partly contribute to the enhanced activity, but due to the lack of accurate determination of the local surface temperature on Pt and Au NPs in this work, the relative contributions of hot carriers and plasmonic heating effect to the catalytic activity needs further investigation.All the above results suggested that the coupling LSPR effect of Pt and Au NPs both in UV and visible light range indeed promoted DRM reaction. To understand the mechanism of DRM reaction under light irradiation, the reaction kinetics test on Pt-Au/SiO 2 and Pt/SiO 2 in light and dark were carried out.Figure 3d shows Arrhenius-type plots for the CO 2 conversion rate versus temperature.The apparent activation energy (E a ) of Pt/SiO 2 (243.5211.31kJ mol -1 ) and Pt-Au/SiO 2 (241.3410.56kJ mol -1 ) are similar under dark condition (It is worth noting that the thermal activation energies of the catalysts were higher than those reported in other literature 13 , and the possible reason is shown in Figure S16).Intriguingly, the E a over Pt/SiO 2 and Pt-Au/SiO 2 decreased to 189.239.39 and 170.6910.28kJ mol -1 under light illumination, respectively.These changes in E a suggested that the coupling LSPR effect changed the energetics of DRM reaction. 45n order to reveal the underlying mechanism, FDTD methods were conducted to calculate the intensity of electric near-field of catalysts (see Experimental Section for the details of the FDTD methods).Figure 4 shows the electric fields distributions of the Pt-Au/SiO 2 , Pt/SiO 2 and Au/SiO 2 under light excitation of 350 and 530 nm.The enhancement of the intensity of electric fields (E 2 ) at the surface of Pt NPs in Pt/SiO 2 can be clearly observed (Figure 4a andd).The enhancement of electric fields intensity in Pt/SiO 2 at the 530 nm wavelength was larger than that at the 350 nm wavelength because the near-field peak for E 2 were red-shifted with respect to the far-field peak (absorption efficiency) (Figure S17), which was consistent with the previous report. 46While the enhancement of electric fields intensity at the surface of Au NPs in Au/SiO 2 at the 530 nm wavelength (Figure 4b) was greater than that at the 350 nm wavelength (Figure 4e) due to its plasmon resonance in the visible light region (Figure 3a).When Au/SiO 2 was loaded with Pt NPs, the LSPR of Pt-Au/SiO 2 system was located in the UV and visible region (Figure 3a andS18).The intensities of electric fields on Pt-Au/SiO 2 at the 350 and 530 wavelengths were significantly higher than those of Pt/SiO 2 and Au/SiO 2 (Figure 4c and f) , respectively, which could be explained by the strong near-field coupling between Pt and Au NPs.The generated strong electric fields yield high concentrations of hot electrons at the surface of the Pt and Au NPs.These electrons tend to be more energetic under thermal excitation (673 K) and might play a vital role in activating chemical bonds in chemical transformations. LSPR excitation can generate a large number of hot electrons at the surface of Pt and Au NPs.Hot electrons can directly interact with the adsorbed molecules (acceptor states), resulting in direct hot electrons transfer into the adsorbed molecules, which is proposed as the possible mechanism for plasmonic enhancement in the recent researches. 20DFT calculations (Figure S19) suggest that the excited electrons are distributed on the surface of CO 2 and CH 4 molecules (Pt-CO 2 or Pt-CH 4 clusters) while excited electrons are mainly distributed on the surface of Pt (Pt clusters).In other words, when the Pt-CO 2 or Pt-CH 4 clusters are excited by the light irradiation, hot electrons will transfer from Pt atoms to the adsorbed CO 2 or CH 4 molecules, which may be helpful for the cleaving of CO and C-H bonds.Therefore, the transfer of hot electrons to the adsorbed reactants plays a critical role in the catalytic mechanism via the activation of the reactants. To further determine how light influence the catalytic performances and examine the formed intermediate species in the reaction condition, the interaction between catalysts and CO 2 CH 4 were investigated at 673 K by DRIFTS.Figure 5 shows the infrared (IR) adsorption spectra of Pt/SiO 2 and Pt-Au/SiO 2 in dark and light conditions at 673 K under CO 2 CH 4 mixture.It could be seen that apart from the reactant gas phase contributions (CH 4 centered at ca. 3015 cm -1 , CO 2 centered at ca. 2349 cm -1 ), 47 several peaks can also be observed.The broad peak centered at ca. 1500 cm -1 is characteristic of carbonate types species adsorbed on the support at high temperature. 47The broad band at 2043 cm -1 is assigned to the CO stretch frequency of linearly bound, while the broad band at 1935 cm - 1 is characteristic of 2-fold bridges (bridge-bonded) CO species (CO) on Pt, 48 which can further desorb to form CO. In addition, the broad peak at 3500-3750 cm -1 is assigned to the surface adsorbed hydroxyl (OH) groups 49 and the peaks at 1309 and 1363cm -1 are characteristic of the adsorbed formate (COOH ) species. 50The above results suggest that the HCOO , CO and OH species are the main intermediate species in the process of DRM reaction.Moreover, the intensity of these peaks did not change with time in the reaction (Figure S20).Interestingly, the intensity of characteristic peaks of CO and 6B.h and i). 5152253 In these reactions, the dissociation of CH 4 are the main rate-determining step (RDS) in DRM reaction. 51,54 or the photo-thermal reactions, as the catalysts were controlled and kept at the desired temperature (673 K) even with irradiation of light (as shown in Figure S1c andd), the DRM reaction over Pt-Au/SiO 2 was also supposed to proceed via the thermally activated process (673 K).However, Pt-Au/SiO 2 shows a broad LSPR absorption band covering the UV-to-visible spectral range.Under UV-visible light irradiation, the LSPR of Pt and Au are excited and the electric field intensities at Pt and Au NPs surface are significantly enhanced due to the presence of plasmonic coupling effect of Pt and Au.The induced strong electric field can effectively make the Pt surface sites more active. 31"}, {"llm generation": "UV-vis", "source": "In conclusion, we have demonstrated the coupling of Pt and Au LSPR effect for efficient CO 2 reduction in DRM reaction using UV-vis light illumination.", "context": "In conclusion, we have demonstrated the coupling of Pt and Au LSPR effect for efficient CO 2 reduction in DRM reaction using UV-vis light illumination.The plasmonic coupling effect reduces the activation energies and changes the energetics of the DRM reaction mechanism, with a reaction rate 2. photo-mediated reactions on plasmonic metal NPs by utilizing solar energy.

Figure 1b shows the HAADF-STEM image of Pt-Au/SiO 2 .The size of Pt NPs almost remains unchanged.From the HAADF-STEM images (Figure 1b and S7), Pt NPs were indeed deposited on Au NPs except those directly deposited on SiO 2 support, while not all the Au NPs were loaded with Pt NPs (Figure S8a).EDX mapping spectra (Figure S8) and HRTEM image (Figure S9) of Pt-Au/SiO 2 can distinguish Pt and Au NPs.It is noted that this Pt-Au contact aggregate structures are thermodynamically stable and Au-Pt surface alloy is difficult to form. 37,38 he crystalline structures of the catalysts were determined by XRD analysis (Figure 1c small size.But XPS (Figure 1d) and ICP-OES analysis (Table S1) of the catalysts can detect the presence of Pt.XPS data also show that Pt and Au existed in a metallic state when loaded on the SiO 2 support. 39,40 catalytic activities of the catalysts in DRM reaction with light irradiation (300 nm800 nm, Figure S11) at the same reaction temperature (673 K) are shown in Figure 2 and Figure S12.Clearly, without light illumination, the thermal-catalytic activities of Pt-Au/SiO 2 and Pt/SiO 2 were almost the same, while the Au/SiO 2 showed almost no performance in DRM reaction, which were in well agreement with our earlier report that Au could not activate the reaction of DRM. 28However, the reaction rates of Pt/SiO 2, Pt-Au/SiO 2 and Au/SiO 2 were all improved under irradiation of light.The reaction rates of Pt/SiO 2 and Pt-Au/SiO 2 exhibited a nearly linear dependence on the light intensity, and the increased slop of Pt-Au/SiO 2 was larger than that of Pt/SiO 2 .The linear dependence of catalytic activity on the light intensity agrees well with the mechanism of photoinduced reactions driven by hot electrons. 17,19,31 Te linear dependence also provides an indication that the localized heating, which usually induce an exponential dependence, is negligible in these reactions. 19Additionally, the reaction rates of Pt-Au/SiO 2 were clearly greater than the sum of the reaction rates of Pt/SiO 2 and Au/SiO 2 at the same light intensity.Under light illumination (0.6 W cm -2 ), the CO 2 conversion rates of Pt-Au/SiO 2 and Pt/SiO 2 were 68.6 and 46.6 mol g -1 min -1 , which were about 2.4 and 1.6 times higher than those of the thermal-catalytic process (28.8 and 28.5 mol g -1 min -1 ), respectively.Even without Na modification, the catalytic activity of Pt (No Na)/SiO 2 was also improved (Figure S13) under light irradiation.The catalyst undergone a little deactivation over 6 hours (Figure S14).The conversion of CO 2 over Pt-Au/SiO 2 in the photothermal process is around 0.3.It should be noted that CO 2 conversions were a little higher than CH 4 conversion and the sum of conversion of CO 2 and CH 4 is larger than the sum of yield of CO and H 2 because of the existing reverse water gas shiftreaction (CO 2 H 2 CO H 2 O) as side reaction. 13Meanwhile, the yields of CO and H 2 displayed similar increasing trends compared with the conversions of CO 2 and CH 4, and the mass balance was almost 100.From the above results, it could be speculated that Pt and Au LSPR might have coupling effect to facilitate the activation of CO 2 and CH 4 and improve the catalytic activities in DRM reaction. In order to demonstrate the observed photo-enhancement activities resulting from LSPR coupling effect of Pt and Au NPs, the impact of different irradiation wavelength on the catalytic activities of Pt-Au/SiO 2 and Pt/SiO 2 were performed (utilizing filters U340, L42B440, Y50B480, G545 and R68 to obtain the desired wavelength range, Figure 3a).By the irradiation of light, Pt/SiO 2 exhibited a broad SPR absorption from the range of UV to visible regions with a peak of around 275 nm (Figure 3a and S15). 41,42 otably, interband transitions of Pt NPs can also contribute to the visible absorption. 43While Au/SiO 2 displayed a strong SPR absorption peak centered at 520 nm (Figure 3a). 44terestingly, Pt-Au/SiO 2 also showed a broad absorption and two peaks locating at 275 and 520 nm (Figure 3a), combining the SPR absorption characteristics of both Pt/SiO 2 and Au/SiO 2, and the absorption intensity was remarkably enhanced and exceeded that of Pt/SiO 2 and Au/SiO 2. The catalytic activities of Pt/SiO 2 and Pt-Au/SiO 2 with the irradiation of different wavelengths of light were illustrated in Figure 3b.Clearly, the CO 2 conversion rates of Pt/SiO 2 and Pt-Au/SiO 2 were all improved under different wavelengths of light irradiation.Furthermore, the dependencies of the apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of Pt-Au/SiO 2 and Pt/SiO 2 on the wavelength of irradiation showed the similar trend to the light absorption spectra of Pt-Au/SiO 2 and Pt/SiO 2, respectively (Figure 3c and Table S2).Thus, it can be concluded that the observed activity enhancement was induced by the excitation of hot carrier.In addition, the AQE of Pt-Au/SiO 2 at the wavelength of 520 nm were higher than those at the other four wavelengths and higher than that of Pt/SiO 2 at 520 nm, indicating that surface plasmon and catalytic activity of Pt/SiO 2 were significantly enhanced by introducing Au NPs.It is also worth noting that plasmonic heating effect may also partly contribute to the enhanced activity, but due to the lack of accurate determination of the local surface temperature on Pt and Au NPs in this work, the relative contributions of hot carriers and plasmonic heating effect to the catalytic activity needs further investigation.All the above results suggested that the coupling LSPR effect of Pt and Au NPs both in UV and visible light range indeed promoted DRM reaction. To understand the mechanism of DRM reaction under light irradiation, the reaction kinetics test on Pt-Au/SiO 2 and Pt/SiO 2 in light and dark were carried out.Figure 3d shows Arrhenius-type plots for the CO 2 conversion rate versus temperature.The apparent activation energy (E a ) of Pt/SiO 2 (243.5211.31kJ mol -1 ) and Pt-Au/SiO 2 (241.3410.56kJ mol -1 ) are similar under dark condition (It is worth noting that the thermal activation energies of the catalysts were higher than those reported in other literature 13 , and the possible reason is shown in Figure S16).Intriguingly, the E a over Pt/SiO 2 and Pt-Au/SiO 2 decreased to 189.239.39 and 170.6910.28kJ mol -1 under light illumination, respectively.These changes in E a suggested that the coupling LSPR effect changed the energetics of DRM reaction. 45n order to reveal the underlying mechanism, FDTD methods were conducted to calculate the intensity of electric near-field of catalysts (see Experimental Section for the details of the FDTD methods).Figure 4 shows the electric fields distributions of the Pt-Au/SiO 2 , Pt/SiO 2 and Au/SiO 2 under light excitation of 350 and 530 nm.The enhancement of the intensity of electric fields (E 2 ) at the surface of Pt NPs in Pt/SiO 2 can be clearly observed (Figure 4a andd).The enhancement of electric fields intensity in Pt/SiO 2 at the 530 nm wavelength was larger than that at the 350 nm wavelength because the near-field peak for E 2 were red-shifted with respect to the far-field peak (absorption efficiency) (Figure S17), which was consistent with the previous report. 46While the enhancement of electric fields intensity at the surface of Au NPs in Au/SiO 2 at the 530 nm wavelength (Figure 4b) was greater than that at the 350 nm wavelength (Figure 4e) due to its plasmon resonance in the visible light region (Figure 3a).When Au/SiO 2 was loaded with Pt NPs, the LSPR of Pt-Au/SiO 2 system was located in the UV and visible region (Figure 3a andS18).The intensities of electric fields on Pt-Au/SiO 2 at the 350 and 530 wavelengths were significantly higher than those of Pt/SiO 2 and Au/SiO 2 (Figure 4c and f) , respectively, which could be explained by the strong near-field coupling between Pt and Au NPs.The generated strong electric fields yield high concentrations of hot electrons at the surface of the Pt and Au NPs.These electrons tend to be more energetic under thermal excitation (673 K) and might play a vital role in activating chemical bonds in chemical transformations. LSPR excitation can generate a large number of hot electrons at the surface of Pt and Au NPs.Hot electrons can directly interact with the adsorbed molecules (acceptor states), resulting in direct hot electrons transfer into the adsorbed molecules, which is proposed as the possible mechanism for plasmonic enhancement in the recent researches. 20DFT calculations (Figure S19) suggest that the excited electrons are distributed on the surface of CO 2 and CH 4 molecules (Pt-CO 2 or Pt-CH 4 clusters) while excited electrons are mainly distributed on the surface of Pt (Pt clusters).In other words, when the Pt-CO 2 or Pt-CH 4 clusters are excited by the light irradiation, hot electrons will transfer from Pt atoms to the adsorbed CO 2 or CH 4 molecules, which may be helpful for the cleaving of CO and C-H bonds.Therefore, the transfer of hot electrons to the adsorbed reactants plays a critical role in the catalytic mechanism via the activation of the reactants. To further determine how light influence the catalytic performances and examine the formed intermediate species in the reaction condition, the interaction between catalysts and CO 2 CH 4 were investigated at 673 K by DRIFTS.Figure 5 shows the infrared (IR) adsorption spectra of Pt/SiO 2 and Pt-Au/SiO 2 in dark and light conditions at 673 K under CO 2 CH 4 mixture.It could be seen that apart from the reactant gas phase contributions (CH 4 centered at ca. 3015 cm -1 , CO 2 centered at ca. 2349 cm -1 ), 47 several peaks can also be observed.The broad peak centered at ca. 1500 cm -1 is characteristic of carbonate types species adsorbed on the support at high temperature. 47The broad band at 2043 cm -1 is assigned to the CO stretch frequency of linearly bound, while the broad band at 1935 cm - 1 is characteristic of 2-fold bridges (bridge-bonded) CO species (CO) on Pt, 48 which can further desorb to form CO. In addition, the broad peak at 3500-3750 cm -1 is assigned to the surface adsorbed hydroxyl (OH) groups 49 and the peaks at 1309 and 1363cm -1 are characteristic of the adsorbed formate (COOH ) species. 50The above results suggest that the HCOO , CO and OH species are the main intermediate species in the process of DRM reaction.Moreover, the intensity of these peaks did not change with time in the reaction (Figure S20).Interestingly, the intensity of characteristic peaks of CO and 6B.h and i). 5152253 In these reactions, the dissociation of CH 4 are the main rate-determining step (RDS) in DRM reaction. 51,54 or the photo-thermal reactions, as the catalysts were controlled and kept at the desired temperature (673 K) even with irradiation of light (as shown in Figure S1c andd), the DRM reaction over Pt-Au/SiO 2 was also supposed to proceed via the thermally activated process (673 K).However, Pt-Au/SiO 2 shows a broad LSPR absorption band covering the UV-to-visible spectral range.Under UV-visible light irradiation, the LSPR of Pt and Au are excited and the electric field intensities at Pt and Au NPs surface are significantly enhanced due to the presence of plasmonic coupling effect of Pt and Au.The induced strong electric field can effectively make the Pt surface sites more active. 31"}], "reactor type": [{"llm generation": "Fixed-bed", "source": "The photocatalytic reaction was carried out at atmospheric pressure in a fixed-bed reactor system (the reactor system is home-made by ourselves, and see details in Figure S1).", "context": "Preparation of Au/SiO 2 : Au/SiO 2 catalysts with different loadings were prepared with urea-precipitation method.In general, 1.0 g SiO 2 was added into 100.0mL of an aqueous solution of HAuCl 4 (0.51 mM) and urea (11.4 g).The suspension was maintained at 80 C with vigorous stir for 4 h, then centrifuged, washed, dried and calcined at 400 C for 4 h.The theoretical loadings of Au was 1.0 wt..

The catalyst (20 mg) was placed uniformly in the DR cell, then Ar (20 mL min -1 ) was introduced into the cell at 673 K for 30 min to acquired the background spectrum of the sample.Then CO 2 CH 4 Ar (1:1:2) mixture (10.0 mL min -1 ) was introduced into the cell at 673 K for 60 min.After that, the spectra were recorded at 673 K under CO 2 CH 4 Ar (1:1:2) mixture (10.0 mL min -1 ) in the dark and with the irradiation of UV-visible light (300800 nm, 0.6 W cm -1 ). The electromagnetic fields distributed around plasmonic Pt and Au nanoparticles were conducted using finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) methods (FullWAVE, Synopsys'RSoft).The dielectric functions of Rh, Au and SiO 2 were taken from the literature. 32 All calculations were carried out with VASP code based on the density-functional theory (DFT). 33The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) was used for the exchange-correlation energy.A plane-wave expansion for the basis set with a cutoff energy of 450 eV was employed.To the CO 2 /Pt and CH 4 /Pt interface models, we constructed a slab model containing a CO 2 or CH 4 molecule on a (111) Pt surface with five atomic layers, and a vacuum region of 20 A was included.551 Monk-horst kpoint meshes was used for the Brillouin-zone integrations of the slab model, respectively. All atoms, excluding the last two atomic layer of Pt, were relaxed until the residual force was less than 0.01 eV/A.In addition, the DFT-D2 method proposed by Grimme was adopted to describe the van der Waals (vdW) interactions. 34"}]}}
