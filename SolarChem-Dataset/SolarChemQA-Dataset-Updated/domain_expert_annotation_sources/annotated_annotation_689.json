To ascertain our hypothesis, XPS analysis was performed over fresh BOB-NS and spent BOB-NS after visible light irradiation (BOB-NS-VLT).Based on the XPS survey spectra, Bi, O and Br were observed in both BOB-NS and BOB-NS-VLT, which are in good agreement with the chemical compositions of the samples (Fig. 3A).As disclosed by the high resolution Bi 4f spectra (Fig. 3B), BOB-NS exhibited two peaks at 159.4 and 164.7 eV, representing the Bi 4f7/2 and Bi 4f5/2 spin-orbital splitting photoelectrons in the Bi 3 chemical state, respectively.In comparison, a 0.1 eV shift to higher binding energy was demonstrated by BOB-NS-VLT and two additional small peaks at 161.0 and 166.0 eV were formed.These observations of peak shifting and existence of additional peaks could be classically ascribed to the presence of Bi (3-x) chemical state, owing to the existence of OV defects.Further evidence of the presence of OVs on BOB-NS-VLT was provided by the high resolution O 1s spectra (Fig. 3C).The asymmetric nature of the peaks revealed the co-existence of low binding energy component (LBEC) and high binding energy component (HBEC) 28.The LBEC at 530.2 eV could be attributed to the lattice oxygen (Olatt) species whereas the HBEC at 532.0 eV corresponded to the adsorbed oxygen (Oads) such as surface hydroxylation and adsorbed H2O.As widely accepted, the density of OVs could be reflected by the intensity of HBEC 29.For BOB-NS, the ratio of LBEC to HBEC was 6.31 whereas the ratio was decreased to 5.77 for BOB-NS-VLT, which further attested the presence of OVs on BOB-NS-VLT.As could be seen from Fig. 3D, the high resolution Br 3d spectrum of BOB-NS could be deconvoluted into two peaks at 68.5 and 69.5 eV, which could be ascribed to the 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 of Br -chemical state, respectively.For the case of BOB-NS-VLT, a 0.2 eV shift to higher binding energy was observed, implying a change in the electron density due to the formation of OVs. in Fig. 4A.The strong peaks at 59 and 115 cm -1 could be assigned to the A1g internal Bi-Br stretching mode, whereas the small peak at 93 cm -1 corresponded to A1g first-order vibration modes of Bi metal 17,30.Meanwhile, the peak at 162 cm -1 could be attributed to the Eg Bi-Br stretching mode 31.All these sharp and intense peaks implied that BOB-NS is of high crystallinity.After visible light irradiation, BOB-NS-VLT demonstrated severe broadening and weakening of peaks, accompanied with peaks shifted to lower frequency.This phenomenon further manifested the presence of OVs, where the displacement of oxygen atoms led to the lattice distortion and crystallinity weakening of BOB-NS-VLT 32.All these characterization provided undeniable To ascertain the presence of OVs for enhanced photocatalytic performance, optical properties of the as-developed samples were examined.As shown in Fig. 4B inset, the BOB-NS before light irradiation appeared to be in yellowish-white colour, whereas a fascinating colour change to blackish-grey was observed on the area with direct light irradiation.The stark alteration of the colour was reflected by the UV-Vis absorption spectra of BOB-NS and BOB-NS-VLT (Fig. 4B). As expected, the presence of OVs on BOB-NS-VLT greatly enhanced the light absorption of the sample in the visible light region, as a result of the occurrence of indirect sub-band excitation which alters the optical properties of the semiconductor.Similar phenomenon of OV-enhanced absorption has also been reported in the literature 33.Based on the Tauc plots in Fig. 4C, the bandgap energies of BOB-NS and BOB-NS-VLT were estimated to be 2.81 and 2.56 eV, respectively.This bandgap-narrowing suggested that surface OV engineering is an effective approach to tailor the electronic structures of the semiconductors. To elucidate this, Mott-Schottky analysis was performed to shed some light on the electronic band potentials of the samples.As shown in Fig. 4D, the flat band potentials (Efb) of BOB-NS and BOB-NS-VLT were found to be -1.15 and -1.06 V vs. Ag/AgCl, which are equivalent to -0.95 and -0.86 V vs. normal hydrogen electrode (NHE), respectively.Besides, the positive slopes of the Mott-Schottky plots manifested that the samples are of n-type semiconductors 34.As widely accepted, the CB potentials of n-type semiconductors are 0 -0.2 eV higher than the Efb, depending on both carrier concentration and electron effective mass 35.In this case, the difference was set as 0.1 eV, hence the CB minimum are -1.25 and -1.16 eV for BOB-NS and BOB-NS-VLT, respectively.Working in conjunction with the bandgaps determined from Tauc plots, the VB maximum were estimated to be positioned at 1.56 eV for BOB-NS and 1.40 eV for BOB-NS-VLT.This phenomenon of OV-induced bandgap narrowing along with CB edge downshifting and VB edge uplifting was concordant with our previous work 36 and other literature 37,38.It is worth highlighting that BOB-NS-VLT exhibited a substantially smaller Mott-Schottky slope compared to BOB-NS, indicating that the donor density of BOB-VS-VLT was remarkably increased after the introduction of OV defects 39.This enhancement in donor density could facilitate the charge separation and transport, resulting in an improved charge collection efficiency and retarding the recombination of charge carriers, which were corroborated by the transient photocurrent responses of the samples.As demonstrated in Fig. 5A and5B, BOB-NS exhibited superior performance over four consecutive test cycles under identical experimental conditions.These findings suggested that the as-prepared photocatalyst possesses excellent recyclability and long-term stability for repeated applications.It is worth noting that the second test cycle produced higher amount of CH4 than first cycle, which could be accredited to the sufficient irradiation time for the generation of abundant surface OVs on BOB-NS.As divulged by the transient photocurrent responses and EIS Nyquist plots, the existence of OVs is beneficial for the transfer and separation of photogenerated charge carries, thereby hindering the recombination of electron-hole pairs and enhancing its photocatalytic performance.In addition, the optical properties of the sample were significantly altered after the generation of OVs (reflected by UV-vis absorption spectra), which guaranteed more light absorption to initiate the generation of electron hole pairs.As manifested in our previous works, the OV sites not only effectively trap the photoinduced electrons, it could also act as the adsorption sites for CO2 molecules, where the CO2 molecules were spontaneously activated to CO2 -radicals through accepting electrons from the OV sites 36,41.In the context of CO2 photoreduction, this is highly desirable as the formation of CO2 -radicals is the rate determining step of the reaction.Furthermore, the attractions between CO2 molecules and OV sites would generate unexpected infinity interactions, which could lower the energy barriers for interfacial charge transfers.Generally, free O atoms from the dissociation of CO2 would reoxidize the sample surface, leading to the termination of photocatalytic reactions 29,42.However, in this case, the visible light-induced OVs formation could maintain the performance of the BOB-NS, as these OVs were in situ refreshed as the reaction proceeded.This was evidenced by the long-term stability of these samples, where insignificant deterioration of the activity was observed after four repeating cycles.Since the existence of surface OVs rendered effective charge separation and inhibited electron-hole pairs recombination through the trapping of electrons at the OV-induced defect states, the mechanisms of photocatalytic CO2 reduction over BOB-NS before and after the formation of OVs were proposed and illustrated in Fig. 6.Considering the highly facile preparation of ultrathin BOB-NS and its superior and long-lasting photocatalytic activities, it is believed that BOB-NS would be a promising next generation photocatalyst for a myriad of applications."}, {"llm generation": "BOB-NS (ultrathin BiOBr nanosheets)", "source": "The concomitant effects of

exhibited a highest CH4 production yield of 2.15 mol g -1 h -1 , demonstrating a 3.3-fold improvement over its pristine BiOBr nanoplates counterpart (BOB-NP).In comparison to other photocatalysts which require post-treatments or strong reducing agents to regenerate the OVs, the OV defects on BOB-NS could be easily formed and refreshed during the visible-light-driven CO2 photoreduction, leading to sustainable active sites long-term photoactivities.We believe that the findings from the current study would deliver some in-depth and imperative insights that the spatial location engineering of

The sample structures and morphologies were examined by a Hitachi SU 8010 field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM).Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), highresolution TEM (HRTEM) images and selected-area electron microscopy (SAED) patterns were taken by a TECNAI G2 F20 transmission electron microscope operating at 200 kV.The specimen for TEM imaging was prepared by depositing a drop of sample suspension in ethanol onto a carbon-coated copper grid.The crystallographic phase composition of the samples was determined by a Bruker D8 Discover X-ray diffractometer using Ni-filtered Cu K radiation ( 1.5406A) at a scan rate of 0.02 s -1 .For the analysis, the accelerating voltage and applied current were set at 40 kV and 40 mA, respectively.Raman spectra was attained by a Horiba LabRAM HR Evolution The transient photocurrent responses and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) Nyquist plots and of the as-fabricated photocatalysts were obtained by an electrochemical workstation (CHI 6005E) in a conventional three-electrode quartz cell.The working electrode was obtained by drop-casting the samples in ethanol suspension (5 mg/mL) onto a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass slide with an electroactive area fixed at 1.0 cm 2 , while Pt served as counter electrode and Ag/AgCl saturated with 3 M KCl employed as reference electrode.All three electrodes were immersed in the electrolyte (0.5 M Na2SO4) during the analysis.A 500 W Xenon arc lamp (CHF-XM-500W) equipped with an UV cut-off filter (to provide visible light with 400 nm) was employed as the exciting visible light source. The photoreduction of CO2 into CH4 experiments were performed in a custom-made, continuous gas flow reactor.Typically, the as-developed photocatalysts were uniformly coated on glass rods where the mass loading of the photocatalysts was fixed at 30 mg to ensure a fair comparison between the samples.Then, the coated glass rods were inserted into quartz columns and high purity CO2 (99.999 ) were bubble through H2O to generate a mixture of CO2/H2O as reactant gas.The reactant gas was directed to the quartz columns to allow intimate contact with the photocatalysts.Prior to light irradiation, the reactant gas was bubbled at a flow rate of 50 mL/min for 30 min to evacuate air from the system and to allow the reactant gas to completely adsorb on the photocatalyst surface.Henceforth, the flow rate of reactant gas was reduced to 5 mL/min and the photocatalysts were irradiated by a 500W Xenon arc lamp (CHF-XM-500W) equipped with an UV cut-off filter (remove 400 nm) to provide visible light source.The product gas was taken at every 1 h interval and the components were analyzed and quantified by gas chromatography (Agilent 7820A) equipped with flame ionized detector (FID) and thermal conductivity detector (TCD).The experiment was conducted at atmospheric pressure and room temperature, and the set-up was kept in a black box to avoid surrounding light interference (Fig. S1 in the supplementary information).The CH4 yield from the photocatalytic CO2 reduction experiment was quantified using Eq.

To ascertain our hypothesis, XPS analysis was performed over fresh BOB-NS and spent BOB-NS after visible light irradiation (BOB-NS-VLT).Based on the XPS survey spectra, Bi, O and Br were observed in both BOB-NS and BOB-NS-VLT, which are in good agreement with the chemical compositions of the samples (Fig. 3A).As disclosed by the high resolution Bi 4f spectra (Fig. 3B), BOB-NS exhibited two peaks at 159.4 and 164.7 eV, representing the Bi 4f7/2 and Bi 4f5/2 spin-orbital splitting photoelectrons in the Bi 3 chemical state, respectively.In comparison, a 0.1 eV shift to higher binding energy was demonstrated by BOB-NS-VLT and two additional small peaks at 161.0 and 166.0 eV were formed.These observations of peak shifting and existence of additional peaks could be classically ascribed to the presence of Bi (3-x) chemical state, owing to the existence of OV defects.Further evidence of the presence of OVs on BOB-NS-VLT was provided by the high resolution O 1s spectra (Fig. 3C).The asymmetric nature of the peaks revealed the co-existence of low binding energy component (LBEC) and high binding energy component (HBEC) 28.The LBEC at 530.2 eV could be attributed to the lattice oxygen (Olatt) species whereas the HBEC at 532.0 eV corresponded to the adsorbed oxygen (Oads) such as surface hydroxylation and adsorbed H2O.As widely accepted, the density of OVs could be reflected by the intensity of HBEC 29.For BOB-NS, the ratio of LBEC to HBEC was 6.31 whereas the ratio was decreased to 5.77 for BOB-NS-VLT, which further attested the presence of OVs on BOB-NS-VLT.As could be seen from Fig. 3D, the high resolution Br 3d spectrum of BOB-NS could be deconvoluted into two peaks at 68.5 and 69.5 eV, which could be ascribed to the 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 of Br -chemical state, respectively.For the case of BOB-NS-VLT, a 0.2 eV shift to higher binding energy was observed, implying a change in the electron density due to the formation of OVs. in Fig. 4A.The strong peaks at 59 and 115 cm -1 could be assigned to the A1g internal Bi-Br stretching mode, whereas the small peak at 93 cm -1 corresponded to A1g first-order vibration modes of Bi metal 17,30.Meanwhile, the peak at 162 cm -1 could be attributed to the Eg Bi-Br stretching mode 31.All these sharp and intense peaks implied that BOB-NS is of high crystallinity.After visible light irradiation, BOB-NS-VLT demonstrated severe broadening and weakening of peaks, accompanied with peaks shifted to lower frequency.This phenomenon further manifested the presence of OVs, where the displacement of oxygen atoms led to the lattice distortion and crystallinity weakening of BOB-NS-VLT 32.All these characterization provided undeniable To ascertain the presence of OVs for enhanced photocatalytic performance, optical properties of the as-developed samples were examined.As shown in Fig. 4B inset, the BOB-NS before light irradiation appeared to be in yellowish-white colour, whereas a fascinating colour change to blackish-grey was observed on the area with direct light irradiation.The stark alteration of the colour was reflected by the UV-Vis absorption spectra of BOB-NS and BOB-NS-VLT (Fig. 4B). As expected, the presence of OVs on BOB-NS-VLT greatly enhanced the light absorption of the sample in the visible light region, as a result of the occurrence of indirect sub-band excitation which alters the optical properties of the semiconductor.Similar phenomenon of OV-enhanced absorption has also been reported in the literature 33.Based on the Tauc plots in Fig. 4C, the bandgap energies of BOB-NS and BOB-NS-VLT were estimated to be 2.81 and 2.56 eV, respectively.This bandgap-narrowing suggested that surface OV engineering is an effective approach to tailor the electronic structures of the semiconductors. To elucidate this, Mott-Schottky analysis was performed to shed some light on the electronic band potentials of the samples.As shown in Fig. 4D, the flat band potentials (Efb) of BOB-NS and BOB-NS-VLT were found to be -1.15 and -1.06 V vs. Ag/AgCl, which are equivalent to -0.95 and -0.86 V vs. normal hydrogen electrode (NHE), respectively.Besides, the positive slopes of the Mott-Schottky plots manifested that the samples are of n-type semiconductors 34.As widely accepted, the CB potentials of n-type semiconductors are 0 -0.2 eV higher than the Efb, depending on both carrier concentration and electron effective mass 35.In this case, the difference was set as 0.1 eV, hence the CB minimum are -1.25 and -1.16 eV for BOB-NS and BOB-NS-VLT, respectively.Working in conjunction with the bandgaps determined from Tauc plots, the VB maximum were estimated to be positioned at 1.56 eV for BOB-NS and 1.40 eV for BOB-NS-VLT.This phenomenon of OV-induced bandgap narrowing along with CB edge downshifting and VB edge uplifting was concordant with our previous work 36 and other literature 37,38.It is worth highlighting that BOB-NS-VLT exhibited a substantially smaller Mott-Schottky slope compared to BOB-NS, indicating that the donor density of BOB-VS-VLT was remarkably increased after the introduction of OV defects 39.This enhancement in donor density could facilitate the charge separation and transport, resulting in an improved charge collection efficiency and retarding the recombination of charge carriers, which were corroborated by the transient photocurrent responses of the samples.As demonstrated in Fig. 5A and5B, BOB-NS exhibited superior performance over four consecutive test cycles under identical experimental conditions.These findings suggested that the as-prepared photocatalyst possesses excellent recyclability and long-term stability for repeated applications.It is worth noting that the second test cycle produced higher amount of CH4 than first cycle, which could be accredited to the sufficient irradiation time for the generation of abundant surface OVs on BOB-NS.As divulged by the transient photocurrent responses and EIS Nyquist plots, the existence of OVs is beneficial for the transfer and separation of photogenerated charge carries, thereby hindering the recombination of electron-hole pairs and enhancing its photocatalytic performance.In addition, the optical properties of the sample were significantly altered after the generation of OVs (reflected by UV-vis absorption spectra), which guaranteed more light absorption to initiate the generation of electron hole pairs.As manifested in our previous works, the OV sites not only effectively trap the photoinduced electrons, it could also act as the adsorption sites for CO2 molecules, where the CO2 molecules were spontaneously activated to CO2 -radicals through accepting electrons from the OV sites 36,41.In the context of CO2 photoreduction, this is highly desirable as the formation of CO2 -radicals is the rate determining step of the reaction.Furthermore, the attractions between CO2 molecules and OV sites would generate unexpected infinity interactions, which could lower the energy barriers for interfacial charge transfers.Generally, free O atoms from the dissociation of CO2 would reoxidize the sample surface, leading to the termination of photocatalytic reactions 29,42.However, in this case, the visible light-induced OVs formation could maintain the performance of the BOB-NS, as these OVs were in situ refreshed as the reaction proceeded.This was evidenced by the long-term stability of these samples, where insignificant deterioration of the activity was observed after four repeating cycles.Since the existence of surface OVs rendered effective charge separation and inhibited electron-hole pairs recombination through the trapping of electrons at the OV-induced defect states, the mechanisms of photocatalytic CO2 reduction over BOB-NS before and after the formation of OVs were proposed and illustrated in Fig. 6.Considering the highly facile preparation of ultrathin BOB-NS and its superior and long-lasting photocatalytic activities, it is believed that BOB-NS would be a promising next generation photocatalyst for a myriad of applications."}, {"llm generation": "UV-Vis", "source": "The concomitant effects of the surface OV defects,

of 2.15 mol g -1 h -1 , demonstrating a 3.3-fold improvement over its pristine BiOBr nanoplates counterpart (BOB-NP).In comparison to other photocatalysts which require post-treatments or strong reducing agents to regenerate the OVs, the OV defects on BOB-NS could be easily formed and refreshed during the visible-light-driven CO2 photoreduction, leading to sustainable active sites long-term photoactivities.We believe that the findings from the current study would deliver some in-depth and imperative insights that the spatial location engineering of OVs could be an efficient and cost-effective approach for designing photocatalysts with remarkable performance. spectrometer with a laser excitation at 514 nm.The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) survey and narrow scan

The photoreduction of CO2 into CH4 experiments were performed in a custom-made, continuous gas flow reactor.Typically, the as-developed photocatalysts were uniformly coated on glass rods where the mass loading of the photocatalysts was fixed at 30 mg to ensure a fair comparison between the samples.Then, the coated glass rods were inserted into quartz columns and high purity CO2 (99.999 ) were bubble through H2O to generate a mixture of CO2/H2O as reactant gas.The reactant gas was directed to the quartz columns to allow intimate contact with the photocatalysts.Prior to light irradiation, the reactant gas was bubbled at a flow rate of 50 mL/min for 30 min to evacuate air from the system and to allow the reactant gas to completely adsorb on the photocatalyst surface.Henceforth, the flow rate of reactant gas was reduced to 5 mL/min and the photocatalysts were irradiated by a 500W Xenon arc lamp (CHF-XM-500W) equipped with an UV cut-off filter (remove 400 nm) to provide visible light source.The product gas was taken at every 1 h interval and the components were analyzed and quantified by gas chromatography (Agilent 7820A) equipped with flame ionized detector (FID) and thermal conductivity detector (TCD).The experiment was conducted at atmospheric pressure and room temperature, and the set-up was kept in a black box to avoid surrounding light interference (Fig. S1 in the supplementary information).The CH4 yield from the photocatalytic CO2 reduction experiment was quantified using Eq.

To ascertain our hypothesis, XPS analysis was performed over fresh BOB-NS and spent BOB-NS after visible light irradiation (BOB-NS-VLT).Based on the XPS survey spectra, Bi, O and Br were observed in both BOB-NS and BOB-NS-VLT, which are in good agreement with the chemical compositions of the samples (Fig. 3A).As disclosed by the high resolution Bi 4f spectra (Fig. 3B), BOB-NS exhibited two peaks at 159.4 and 164.7 eV, representing the Bi 4f7/2 and Bi 4f5/2 spin-orbital splitting photoelectrons in the Bi 3 chemical state, respectively.In comparison, a 0.1 eV shift to higher binding energy was demonstrated by BOB-NS-VLT and two additional small peaks at 161.0 and 166.0 eV were formed.These observations of peak shifting and existence of additional peaks could be classically ascribed to the presence of Bi (3-x) chemical state, owing to the existence of OV defects.Further evidence of the presence of OVs on BOB-NS-VLT was provided by the high resolution O 1s spectra (Fig. 3C).The asymmetric nature of the peaks revealed the co-existence of low binding energy component (LBEC) and high binding energy component (HBEC) 28.The LBEC at 530.2 eV could be attributed to the lattice oxygen (Olatt) species whereas the HBEC at 532.0 eV corresponded to the adsorbed oxygen (Oads) such as surface hydroxylation and adsorbed H2O.As widely accepted, the density of OVs could be reflected by the intensity of HBEC 29.For BOB-NS, the ratio of LBEC to HBEC was 6.31 whereas the ratio was decreased to 5.77 for BOB-NS-VLT, which further attested the presence of OVs on BOB-NS-VLT.As could be seen from Fig. 3D, the high resolution Br 3d spectrum of BOB-NS could be deconvoluted into two peaks at 68.5 and 69.5 eV, which could be ascribed to the 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 of Br -chemical state, respectively.For the case of BOB-NS-VLT, a 0.2 eV shift to higher binding energy was observed, implying a change in the electron density due to the formation of OVs. in Fig. 4A.The strong peaks at 59 and 115 cm -1 could be assigned to the A1g internal Bi-Br stretching mode, whereas the small peak at 93 cm -1 corresponded to A1g first-order vibration modes of Bi metal 17,30.Meanwhile, the peak at 162 cm -1 could be attributed to the Eg Bi-Br stretching mode 31.All these sharp and intense peaks implied that BOB-NS is of high crystallinity.After visible light irradiation, BOB-NS-VLT demonstrated severe broadening and weakening of peaks, accompanied with peaks shifted to lower frequency.This phenomenon further manifested the presence of OVs, where the displacement of oxygen atoms led to the lattice distortion and crystallinity weakening of BOB-NS-VLT 32.All these characterization provided undeniable To ascertain the presence of OVs for enhanced photocatalytic performance, optical properties of the as-developed samples were examined.As shown in Fig. 4B inset, the BOB-NS before light irradiation appeared to be in yellowish-white colour, whereas a fascinating colour change to blackish-grey was observed on the area with direct light irradiation.The stark alteration of the colour was reflected by the UV-Vis absorption spectra of BOB-NS and BOB-NS-VLT (Fig. 4B). As expected, the presence of OVs on BOB-NS-VLT greatly enhanced the light absorption of the sample in the visible light region, as a result of the occurrence of indirect sub-band excitation which alters the optical properties of the semiconductor.Similar phenomenon of OV-enhanced absorption has also been reported in the literature 33.Based on the Tauc plots in Fig. 4C, the bandgap energies of BOB-NS and BOB-NS-VLT were estimated to be 2.81 and 2.56 eV, respectively.This bandgap-narrowing suggested that surface OV engineering is an effective approach to tailor the electronic structures of the semiconductors. To elucidate this, Mott-Schottky analysis was performed to shed some light on the electronic band potentials of the samples.As shown in Fig. 4D, the flat band potentials (Efb) of BOB-NS and BOB-NS-VLT were found to be -1.15 and -1.06 V vs. Ag/AgCl, which are equivalent to -0.95 and -0.86 V vs. normal hydrogen electrode (NHE), respectively.Besides, the positive slopes of the Mott-Schottky plots manifested that the samples are of n-type semiconductors 34.As widely accepted, the CB potentials of n-type semiconductors are 0 -0.2 eV higher than the Efb, depending on both carrier concentration and electron effective mass 35.In this case, the difference was set as 0.1 eV, hence the CB minimum are -1.25 and -1.16 eV for BOB-NS and BOB-NS-VLT, respectively.Working in conjunction with the bandgaps determined from Tauc plots, the VB maximum were estimated to be positioned at 1.56 eV for BOB-NS and 1.40 eV for BOB-NS-VLT.This phenomenon of OV-induced bandgap narrowing along with CB edge downshifting and VB edge uplifting was concordant with our previous work 36 and other literature 37,38.It is worth highlighting that BOB-NS-VLT exhibited a substantially smaller Mott-Schottky slope compared to BOB-NS, indicating that the donor density of BOB-VS-VLT was remarkably increased after the introduction of OV defects 39.This enhancement in donor density could facilitate the charge separation and transport, resulting in an improved charge collection efficiency and retarding the recombination of charge carriers, which were corroborated by the transient photocurrent responses of the samples.As demonstrated in Fig. 5A and5B, BOB-NS exhibited superior performance over four consecutive test cycles under identical experimental conditions.These findings suggested that the as-prepared photocatalyst possesses excellent recyclability and long-term stability for repeated applications.It is worth noting that the second test cycle produced higher amount of CH4 than first cycle, which could be accredited to the sufficient irradiation time for the generation of abundant surface OVs on BOB-NS.As divulged by the transient photocurrent responses and EIS Nyquist plots, the existence of OVs is beneficial for the transfer and separation of photogenerated charge carries, thereby hindering the recombination of electron-hole pairs and enhancing its photocatalytic performance.In addition, the optical properties of the sample were significantly altered after the generation of OVs (reflected by UV-vis absorption spectra), which guaranteed more light absorption to initiate the generation of electron hole pairs.As manifested in our previous works, the OV sites not only effectively trap the photoinduced electrons, it could also act as the adsorption sites for CO2 molecules, where the CO2 molecules were spontaneously activated to CO2 -radicals through accepting electrons from the OV sites 36,41.In the context of CO2 photoreduction, this is highly desirable as the formation of CO2 -radicals is the rate determining step of the reaction.Furthermore, the attractions between CO2 molecules and OV sites would generate unexpected infinity interactions, which could lower the energy barriers for interfacial charge transfers.Generally, free O atoms from the dissociation of CO2 would reoxidize the sample surface, leading to the termination of photocatalytic reactions 29,42.However, in this case, the visible light-induced OVs formation could maintain the performance of the BOB-NS, as these OVs were in situ refreshed as the reaction proceeded.This was evidenced by the long-term stability of these samples, where insignificant deterioration of the activity was observed after four repeating cycles.Since the existence of surface OVs rendered effective charge separation and inhibited electron-hole pairs recombination through the trapping of electrons at the OV-induced defect states, the mechanisms of photocatalytic CO2 reduction over BOB-NS before and after the formation of OVs were proposed and illustrated in Fig. 6.Considering the highly facile preparation of ultrathin BOB-NS and its superior and long-lasting photocatalytic activities, it is believed that BOB-NS would be a promising next generation photocatalyst for a myriad of applications."}]}}
