denoted as xHF-TiO 2 /yCr 2 O 3 , where y indicates the apparent loading amounts of Cr 2 O 3 (y 0-1.5).", "context": "Anatase TiO 2 nanoparticles with different crystal facets ratios were prepared by the solvothermal method 35.Typically, 30 mL of Ti (OC 4 H 9 ) 4 as souse of Ti and a certain amount of hydrofluoric acid (HF) with a concentration of 40 wt as crystal control agent were mixed under stirring to produce a homogeneous solution.The solution was transferred into a dried Teflon-lined autoclave with a capacity of 100 mL at room temperature and then kept at 180 C for 48 h.After the hydrothermal reaction, the white precipitates were collected by centrifugation, washed with ethanol and distilled water three times, and then dried in an oven at 80 C for 12 h.According to the adding amount of HF (200, 140, 70, and 0 mmol) used in the synthesis, the as-obtained samples were labeled as xHF-TiO 2 (x 3, 2, 1, 0).As the value of x increases, the percentage of exposed 0 0 1 facets increases. Cr 2 O 3 was implanted on the as-prepared xHF-TiO 2 (x 3, 2, 1, 0) by photodeposition under UV-visible light irradiation.K 2 CrO 4 solution was used as the source of Cr.In a typical preparation, 0.15 g of xHF-TiO 2 and a certain concentration of K 2 CrO 4 aqueous solution were dispersed in 100 mL of an aqueous solution, which was then degassed completely and irradiated with a 300 W Xe lamp (CEL-HXUV300E, Beijing CEAULIGHT Technology Co., Ltd.) under stirring for 4 h.The obtained photocatalysts were collected by centrifugation, washed with ethanol and distilled water, and dried at -50 C in a lyophilizer for 24 h.The samples were denoted as xHF-TiO 2 /yCr 2 O 3 , where y indicates the apparent loading amounts of Cr 2 O 3 (y 0-1.5).For example, when 3HF-TiO 2 was applied for Cr 2 O 3 implanting, 0.05 wt, 0.1 wt, and 0.5 wt of Cr precursor were fed, the corresponding as-obtained samples were then labelled as 3HF-TiO 2 /0.05Cr 2 O 3 , 3HF-TiO 2 /0.1Cr 2 O 3 , and 3HF-TiO 2 /0.5Cr 2 O 3 , respectively.All the other samples were denoted in the same manner. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was carried out to determine the crystalline structures of the samples by an X-ray diffractometer (TTRIII, Rigaku) with Cu K radiation at a scan rate of 10 /min.Raman spectral (LabRam HR Raman spectrometer) was used to estimate the percentage of certain exposed facets.The excitation wavelength is 532 nm.The morphology of samples was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2011F) and scanning electron microscope (Genimi SEM 500).To further identify the location and distribution of Cr 2 O 3 on TiO 2 , highresolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, Talos F200X) was applied.Synchrotron-radiation vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectrometry (SVUV-PIMS) was carried out at BL03U beamline at the National Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (NSRL).High resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was recorded at beamline BL10B in NSRL.The Cr content was determined by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) (VG, USA).UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-Vis DRS) were measured by a UVvisible absorption spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-2600, Japan) in the wavelength range of 300-700 nm, using BaSO 4 as the reference.The CO 2 adsorption isotherms tests and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area were conducted on ASAP 2020 automatic adsorption apparatus (Micromeritics, USA).The photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured by a steady-state fluorescence spectrometer (JY Fluorolog-3-Tou, France).The excitation wavelength was 340 nm.Time-resolved PL spectra were measured by using Edinburgh Photonics FLS980 fluorescence spectrophotometer based on the time-correlated single-photon counting technology. The photoelectrochemical analyses were performed by a conventional three-electrode system, under the irradiation of a 300 W Xe lamp (PLS-SXE 300, Perfect Light, China).During the test, its intensity was adjusted to 100 mW/cm 2 .A working electrode was prepared as follows: 5 mg of samples and 5 L of 5 wt Nafion were dispersed in an aqueous solution containing 1 mL water-ethanol solution with a volume ratio of 1:1.120 L of the mixture was coated onto a 1 1 cm 2 fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass and then dried at 80 C for 1 h.A Pt mesh was used as a counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode.1 M NaOH aqueous solution (pH 13.6) was used as the electrolytes.All the measured potentials were converted to RHE (E RHE E Ag/AgCl 0.197 0.0591 pH, E Ag/AgCl 0.1976 V vs. NHE at 25 C).Amperometric I-t curves were measured under chopped light irradiation with on/off interval of 30 s at 1.23 V vs. RHE.The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were tested at frequencies from 100 kHz to Hz. The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance tests were carried out on the equipment of the CEL-SPH2N system supplied by Beijing CEAULIGHT Technology Co., Ltd.50 mg xHF-TiO 2 /yCr 2 O 3 photocatalyst with 0.4 mL H 2 O was well-distributed onto a groove of a circular glass dish with a radius of 3 cm.Then put the glass dish in a reaction cell with a total volume of 550 mL.300 W Xe lamp (CEL-HXUV300E, Beijing CEAULIGHT Technology Co., Ltd.) was used as the light source.The system was vacuumed and purged with high purity CO 2 gas several times to ensure that no air remained in the reaction vessel, then the pure CO 2 gas was injected into the reaction setup until reaching a certain pressure.All samples were tested under UV-visible irradiation for 6 h.mL of mixed gas was taken out from the reactor at fixed intervals (1 h) during the reaction and analyzed by using a gas chromatograph (GC-1690, Hangzhou Kexiao Scientific Instruments Co. Ltd.) equipped with a flame ionized detector (FID) with a methane reformer.The reaction products were also analyzed by another gas chromatography (GC-7920, Beijing CEAULIGHT Technology Co., Ltd.) with a TCD detector (argon used as carrier gas)."}, {"llm generation": "3HF-TiO 2 /Cr 2 O 3", "source": "Fig. 3a shows the photocatalytic activity of 3HF-TiO 2 /Cr 2 O 3 with various Cr 2 O 3 loading contents (the corresponding time courses of gas evolution were displayed in Fig. S1).", "context": "Fig. 1a shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of 3HF-TiO 2 before and after implanting Cr 2 O 3 through photodeposition.The diffraction peaks are both in good agreement with standard data of JCPDS No. 21-2172, indicating that anatase TiO 2 was successfully synthesized and that loading Cr 2 O 3 with the investigated content didn't change the crystalline phase of 3HF-TiO 2 .The surface chemical elements composition of samples were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).As shown in Fig. 1b, the peaks at 577.7 eV and 586.9 eV are assigned to Cr 3 38,39, indicating the successful loading of Cr 2 O 3 species on 3HF-TiO 2 .Slight changes on the binding energy of Ti 2p and O 1s before and after loading Cr 2 O 3 (Fig. 1c,d) can be attributed to the interaction between Cr 2 O 3 and 3HF-TiO 2 . Fig. 2a-d shows the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images and the corresponding high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images of 3HF-TiO 2 /0.1Cr 2 O 3 and 3HF-TiO 2 .The 0.19 nm interplanar distance matching well with the d(0 0 1) spacings of anatase TiO 2 , suggesting the formation of 0 0 1 facets highly exposed TiO nanoplates.In comparison with 3HF-TiO 2 , it can be clearly seen that the lateral surface (indexed as 1 0 1 facets) of 3HF-TiO 2 /0.1Cr 2 O 3 is much rougher and an amorphous thin layer is attached on it.The scanning transmission electron microscopy high-angle annular dark-field (STEM-HAADF) image and the corresponding energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping (Fig. 2e-h) of 3HF-TiO 2 /0.1Cr 2 O 3 further confirmed that Cr element dominantly dispersed on the lateral surface of 3HF-TiO nanoplates, verifying that the amorphous Cr 2 O 3 has been successfully implanted on the 1 0 1 facets of 3HF-TiO 2 . Fig. 3a shows the photocatalytic activity of 3HF-TiO 2 /Cr 2 O 3 with various Cr 2 O 3 loading contents (the corresponding time courses of gas evolution were displayed in Fig. S1).It can be seen that the main products were CH 4 and CO and that their evolution were obviously improved after loading Cr 2 O 3 .Besides, the photocatalytic conversion efficiency of CO 2 reduction approximately tracked a volcanic curve with the nominal loading amount of Cr 2 O 3 .At the optimal nominal loading amount of Cr 2 O 3 (0.1 wt), the gas evolution rate of both CO and CH reached the highest, which was 3.96 mol/g/h and 1.54 mol/g/h, respectively.The CO 2 conversion efficiency over 3HF-TiO 2 /0.1Cr 2 O 3 is 4 times that on bare 3HF-TiO 2 .The control experiments without photocatalyst or irradiation exhibited ignorable gas evolution, indicating that both photocatalyst and irradiation are integral parts of the photocatalytic reaction.To further disclose the origin of the products, synchrotron-radiation vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectrometry (SVUV-PIMS) was performed at a photon energy of 14.5 eV.The 13 CO 2 labeling experiment (the inset in Fig. 3a) directly verified that the main product CO indeed originated from the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 . To identify the role of Cr 2 O 3 , the photocatalytic activity controlling experiments and the investigation of the charge carriers' transfer were conducted.As shown in Fig. 3a, the photocatalytic activity of CO 2 reduction is significantly enhanced after loading small amounts of Cr 2 O 3 ( 0.5 wt), while the intrinsic photocatalytic activity of Cr 2 O 3 is negligible.These are in line with the concept of 'cocatalysts'.Besides, it was also revealed that the photogenerated charge carriers' separation/ transfer was significantly improved after loading Cr 2 O 3 as indicated from UV-Vis DRS spectra (Fig. 3b) and PL spectra (Fig. 3c), suggesting the facilitated electrons' transfer from TiO 2 to Cr 2 O 3 .These results confirmed that independent Cr 2 O 3 acted as cocatalyst for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction. Since the Cr 2 O 3 cocatalyst is photodeposited on the 1 0 1 facets (the electrons gathering facets) of TiO 2 40, we speculate that the percentage of exposed 1 0 1 facets should significantly affect the actual loading amount of Cr 2 O 3 and further alter the final performance of overall photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.As illustrated in Scheme 1, TiO 2 nanoparticles without any specific facets highly exposed usually suffer from serious carrier recombination, which is the main reason for their poor photocatalytic activity 41.However, neither TiO 2 with an extremely larger percentage of 1 0 1 facets or 0 0 1 facets exposed is desired for overall photocatalytic CO 2 reduction systems because of the potentially unmatched reaction rates of water oxidation half-reaction on the 0 0 1 facets and CO 2 reduction half-reaction on the Cr 2 O 3 which were implanted on the 1 0 1 facets of TiO 2 .Therefore, we deduced that the photocatalytic performance of CO 2 reduction over TiO 2 will be further promoted with an optimal 0 0 1/1 0 1 facets ratio and the corresponding optimal loading amounts of Cr 2 O 3 cocatalysts.To maximize the synergistic effects of loading cocatalyst and crystal facets engineering, we further modulated the exposed facets of TiO 2 and the corresponding optimal loading amounts of Cr 2 O 3 cocatalysts. As indicated from XRD patterns (Fig. S2), TEM (Fig. S3) and SEM images (Fig. S4), 0HF-TiO 2 , 1HF-TiO 2 , and 2HF-TiO 2 samples with various 1 0 1/0 0 1 facets ratio were fabricated.2HF-TiO 2 and 1HF-TiO 2 exhibited a nanoplate-like structure, while the 0HF-TiO 2 had a nanoparticle shape.The percentage of the exposed 0 0 1 facets among samples were evaluated by Raman spectra 42 (Fig. S5) and the results were listed in Table S1.It can be seen that as increasing the amount of capping agent (HF) in the recipe, the percentage of the exposed 0 0 1 facets of 0HF-TiO 2 , 1HF-TiO 2 , 2HF-TiO 2 and 3HF-TiO 2 samples increased. Subsequently, the loading amount of Cr 2 O 3 cocatalyst on the TiO samples with varied 1 0 1/0 0 1 facets ratio were optimized by testing the photocatalytic activity of CO 2 reduction.As shown in Fig. S6, Fig. S7 and Fig. S8, the optimal nominal Cr 2 O 3 loading amount for 0HF-TiO 2 , 1HF-TiO 2 and 2HF-TiO 2 was 0.5 wt, 0.3 wt and 0.2 wt, respectively (the actual loading content of Cr species were evaluated by the inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry and listed in Table S2).The HRTEM images of the corresponding xHF-TiO 2 /yCr 2 O with the optimal Cr 2 O 3 cocatalyst loading amount were presented in Fig. 4a-c.The optimal Cr 2 O 3 loading amount decreased as the percentage of 1 0 1 facets decreased, indicating a geometric area of 1 0 1 facets dependent reaction rate of reduction half-reaction.These results confirmed our aforementioned deduction.There indeed exists an optimal 1 0 1/0 0 1 facets ratio (65:35) of TiO 2 with the corresponding optimal loading amounts of Cr 2 O 3 cocatalysts (that is the case of 2HF-TiO 2 /0.2Cr 2 O 3 ).As shown in Fig. 4d, 2HF-TiO 2 /0.2Cr 2 O exhibited the highest CO and CH 4 evolution rates.Since the possible influencing factors such as crystal phase (Fig. S2), surficial elements composition and their valence states (Fig. S9), particles sizes and specific surface area (Fig. S10, Table S3) had been excluded, the differences on the photocatalytic performance could be attributed to various charge separation/transfer arising from the synergistic effects of facets engineering and cocatalysts loading.When the 1 0 1/0 0 1 facets ratio of TiO 2 is smaller than the optimal value (the case of 3HF-TiO 2 /0.1Cr 2 O 3 ), a smaller amount of Cr 2 O 3 could be implanted on TiO 2 because of the limited geometric area of 1 0 1 facets, resulting in less CO 2 adsorption on the active sites (as evidenced by the CO 2 adsorption isotherms in Fig. S11) and limited electrons' transfer from TiO 2 to Cr 2 O 3 , further leading to lower photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity.While when the 4e.This 30-fold improvement on photocatalytic activity is impressive among some similar photocatalytic system as listed in Table S4.However, 3HF-TiO 2 which was singly modulated by facets engineering (Fig. S12), and 0HF-TiO 2 /0.5Cr 2 O 3 (which was singly modulated by Cr 2 O 3 cocatalysts loading with optimal content) exhibited only 4-fold and 12-fold enhancements on the conversion efficiency of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, respectively.This indicates a significant synergistic effect between TiO 2 crystal facets engineering and Cr 2 O 3 cocatalyst loading. To further reveal the reason behind the improved photocatalytic performance, we conducted the photoelectrochemical tests and timeresolved PL spectra of series of samples.As shown in Fig. 5a,5b, the photocurrent density is enhanced by engineering the crystal facets (the comparison of 3HF-TiO 2 , 2HF-TiO 2 , and 0HF-TiO 2 ) and loading Cr 2 O 3 cocatalyst (the comparison of 0HF-TiO 2 /0.5Cr 2 O 3 vs.0HF-TiO 2 or 2HF-TiO 2 /0.2Cr 2 O 3 vs.2HF-TiO 2 ), respectively.Besides, the highest photocurrent density was achieved on 2HF-TiO 2 /0.2Cr 2 O 3 , revealing that the charge carriers' separation can be improved more significantly by the combination strategy of facets engineering and cocatalysts loading.The smallest acr radius of 2HF-TiO 2 /0.2Cr 2 O 3 in the Nyquist plots (Fig. 5c) also indicates that the combination strategy of facets engineering and cocatalysts loading can elevate the charge carriers' transfer and reduce the reaction resistance at the photocatalyst/solution interface more significantly, which would greatly promote the electron-hole separation.The time-resolved PL decay spectra (Fig. 5d) further reveals that the prolonged lifetime of charge carriers is obtained in 2HF-TiO 2 /0.2Cr 2 O 3 in comparison with the other samples.The average lifetime of charge carriers in series of samples is listed in Table S5.All the above results suggest that the combined crystal facets engineering and cocatalyst loading strategy significantly facilitates the charge carrier's separation/ transfer, thus making grate contribution to the obviously improved photocatalytic activity of CO 2 reduction."}, {"llm generation": "TiO\u2082", "source": "In summary, independent Cr 2 O 3 has been uncovered as an efficient cocatalysts on crystal facets engineered TiO 2 for photocatalytic CO reduction for the first time.", "context": "In summary, independent Cr 2 O 3 has been uncovered as an efficient cocatalysts on crystal facets engineered TiO 2 for photocatalytic CO reduction for the first time.Through adopting the combined strategy of crystal facets engineering and cocatalyst loading, the photocatalytic CO reduction activity over the optimized photocatalyst (2HF-TiO 2 / 0.2Cr 2 O 3 ) was promoted near 30 times in comparison with that over cocatalyst-free TiO 2 without facets engineering (0HT-TiO 2 ).The superior photocatalytic performance was attributed to the maximal synergy of loading Cr 2 O 3 cocatalyst and TiO 2 crystal facets engineering.It was revealed that the maximal synergy dramatically facilitated the photogenerated electrons' transfer from TiO 2 to Cr 2 O 3 , endowing more photogenerated electrons and holes to participate in the following wellmatched CO 2 reduction half-reaction and H 2 O oxidation half-reaction.This study may not only provide inspiration for the deepened understanding of the role of Cr 2 O 3 in photocatalytic systems but also shed light on the design of highly-efficient photocatalysts.
