Fig.2.Firstly, 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid reacts with In 3 and Ce 2 ions to form Ce-doped In-MIL-68 with the hexagonal prisms morphology (step I).The length-diameter ratio of Ce-doped In-MIL-68 hexagonal prisms can be adjusted by using different amounts of 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid.Upon increasing the amount of 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid, the length-width ratio of Ce-doped In-MIL-68 hexagonal prisms gradually increases (Fig.S5).Then the precursors were pyrolyzed in the presence of sulfur powder under an N 2 atmosphere.During the annealing process, the oxygen ions released from the decomposition of ligands (1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid) react with the outward diffusing In and Ce ions within the In-MIL-68, resulting the formation of In 2 O 3 and CeO 2 nanoparticles.These nanoparticles are interconnected to form porous hollow nanowall while keeping the hexagonal prism morphology of the initial Ce-doped In-MIL-68 precursor (step II).Simultaneously, the reaction between organic ligands and sulfur powder promote organic ligands to decompose into H 2 O, CO 2 , and SO 2 gases, leading to the formation of sulfur-doped In 2 O 3 -CeO 2 hollow hexagonal prisms.The produced SO 2 gas was confirmed by the potassium permanganate method (Fig.S6).Meanwhile, some of formed anionic S2-are localized in the In 2 O 3 -CeO 2 lattice in the form of In-O-S and Ce-O-S bond-linkages.Moreover, the pyrolysis of organic ligands leads to the formation of a thin amorphous carbon layer around the In 2 O 3 and CeO 2 nanoparticles, which can be seen from the HRTEM image (Fig. 1f), leading to the formation of sulfur-doped In 2 O 3 -CeO 2 hollow hexagonal prisms with Fig. 2.
