SEM and TEM measurements were used to observe the morphology of STO and SCM.As shown in Fig. 2(a), pristine STO has a porous structure, which increases the number of reaction sites and the trapping of light.The TEM pattern of STO NFs is presented in Fig. 2(b), in which it can be seen that the STO was formed of a porous nanofiber structure covered with STO crystals.After loading with CoP and Mo2C, the SCM NFs became rough, and the EDS elemental mapping of SCM confirmed that CoP and Mo2C were evenly coated on the STO NFs.As shown in Fig. S2, Co, P, and Mo were homogeneously distributed throughout the STO NFs, indicating that CoP and Mo2C had successfully coated the STO NFs.The higher magnification patterns of a certain areas of the STO samples are presented in Figs.2(c) and(d).The lattice spacing of 0.276 nm can be attributed to the (110) plane of STO, illustrating the successful synthesis of STO.The high-resolution (HR)TEM images of SCM are presented in Figs.2(g) and (h), and three different lattice spacings of 0.276, 0.283, and 0.228 nm, corresponding to the (110) plane of STO, (011) plane of CoP, and (101) plane of Mo2C, respectively, were identified.The elemental distribution of SCM was determined using energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) elemental mapping.As clearly seen in Fig. 2(i), Co, P, and Mo were homogeneously distributed throughout the STO NFs, confirming that CoP and Mo2C were evenly coated on the STO NFs.Based on the HRTEM and elemental mapping, we concluded that the dual cocatalysts photocatalyst had been synthesized, and the cocatalysts were uniformly distributed on the surface of STO. In addition, N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms were obtained to investigate the specific surface areas of pristine STO (Fig. 3(a)).STO exhibited a type-IV isotherm pattern, and the specific surface area was 25.93 m 2 /g.The pore size distribution is shown in the inset, and the average pore size is 16.11 nm; thus, the STO NFs contain mesopores.The porous structure helps the sacrificial agent and water pass into the nanofibers, resulting in good contact with the catalyst during the reaction 57,58.Moreover, the porosity increases the number of reaction sites and the trapping of light. The hydrogen generation activity and cycling stability are two important factors for evaluating the photocatalytic performance of the samples.Therefore, the photocatalytic H2 generation activity of the samples was tested under simulated solar light irradiation.As shown in Fig. 3(b), the pure STO NFs have the lowest H2 evolution rate (0.14 mmol g -1 ) because of the fast recombination of photoexcited electrons and holes.All the CoP decorated samples had a higher hydrogen evolution rate than STO, indicating that the modification of CoP is favorable for photocatalytic performance.However, the water splitting performance first increased and then decreased with increase in the amount of CoP.A possible reason is that as more CoP covers the STO surface, less STO is exposed to light and fewer photogenerated charge pairs are produced.Compared with SC-1 (0.28 mmol g -1 ) and SC-3 (0.31 mmol g -1 ), SC-2 yielded the highest H2 evolution rate (0.43 mmol g -1 ), demonstrating that an appropriate amount of CoP is crucial.On the basis of these results, we propose that the excess CoP covering the STO NF surface blocks the light required to excite the STO to generate carriers, whereas a lower amount of cocatalyst results in a lack of active sites to capture photoexcited electrons.Therefore, an appropriate amount of CoP can improve the H2 evolution performance and maximize the use of light. The cycling stability of SC-2 is shown in Fig. 3(c).A slight decrease in the photocatalytic performance was observed after three cycles.However, when another 5 mL of sacrificial agent was added to the quartz reactor, the photocatalytic performance increased to the same level as the first two cycles, indicating that the samples show good stability for photocatalytic H2 generation via water splitting.In addition, SC-2 was collected after the cycling stability test, and the XRD pattern is shown in Fig. 3(e).The results indicate the composite had superior stability because the diffraction peaks of SC-2 did not change after a long reaction period.Thus, both the cycling tests and phase analysis show that SC-2 has excellent stability for hydrogen evolution.Moreover, CoP is an outstanding cocatalyst for STO, which enhances charge separation and H2 evolution. Transient photocurrent response measurements were used to investigate the transfer efficiency of the photoexcited carrier pairs.As shown in Fig. 3(f), pristine STO exhibited the lowest charge transfer efficiency.After hybridization with CoP, the transient photocurrent responses improved remarkably.As expected, SC-2 showed a much higher transient photocurrent response, which corresponds to the hydrogen production performance, than the other hybrid samples.The improvement in photocurrent density is due to the rapid charge transfer from the STO to CoP.The LSV plots were measured in a Na2SO4 solution, as shown in Fig. 3(g).Typically, the earlier the inflection point in the LSV curve, the lower the overpotential required for the catalytic reaction; that is, the photocatalytic reaction is more likely to occur.The onset potential of the hybrid samples is much higher than that of STO, which means that the photocatalytic reaction occurred more easily in the hybrid samples than in STO.Further, pure STO showed the lowest onset potential (-1.82 eV) vs. AgCl, whereas SC-1 and SC-3 yielded onset potentials of -1.66 and -1.62 eV, respectively, vs. AgCl.Com- pared with those of SC-1 and SC-3, SC-2 shows a higher onset potential, indicating a lower overpotential for H2 evolution. Based on the discussion above, hybridization with CoP improves the performance of STO by reducing the overpotential, thus facilitating H2 evolution.Next, PL spectra were obtained to characterize the recombination efficiency of the photoexcited charge-carrier pairs.As mentioned, generally, the emission peak intensity is related to the recombination efficiency of the photoexcited charge pairs.A higher emission intensity indicates a higher recombination of photoexcited charge carrier pairs.As illustrated in Fig. 3(h), the intensity of the emission peak of SC-2 is lower than that of STO, proving that the participation of CoP could effectively inhibit the recombination of photoexcited electron-hole pairs in STO, which is consistent with the transient photocurrent response measurement results.Thus, TPV measurements were performed to test the life, separation, and transfer efficiency of the photoexcited carriers on the surface and interface, as shown in Fig. 3(i).The TPV curve of pristine STO contains low-intensity peaks having a short lifespan, indicating the sluggish separation efficiency and short lifetime of the photogenerated carriers under laser irradiation with a wavelength of 355 nm.After modification with CoP yielding SC-2, the peak intensity was greatly enhanced and showed a plateau, which can be attributed to the accumulation of photoexcited electrons on the sur-face.Additionally, the lifespan of the photoexcited charges was significantly extended, suggesting effective charge migration and prolonged lifetimes.Therefore, the incorporation of STO and CoP can dramatically accelerate the transfer and prolong the lifetime of photogenerated charges owing to the Schottky junction. Although SC-2 showed outstanding photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity, it did not reach our expectations.Thus, we constructed a dual cocatalyst system to improve photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance.When we loaded Mo2C on the SC-2 NFs, the hydrogen generation performance of the hybrids was further improved.Figs.4(a) and (b) show a comparison of the H2 generation activities and cycling stability of SCM and SC-2.Although the addition of CoP improved the H2 yield, the addition of Mo2C further increased the H2 yield and cycling stability.Further, the photocatalyst performance doubled after constructing the dual cocatalysts system, thus achieving a better H2 evolution performance than SC-2.The H2 evolution of SCM decreased after four cycles; then, we added 5 mL of TEOA to the quartz reactor, and the photocatalytic performance increased to the same level as that in the first three cycles.The enhancement in the photocatalytic performance was attributed to the construction of the dual cocatalysts system, which is beneficial for charge migration; as a result, more charges can react rather than recombine.The XRD peaks of SCM after five cycles of the hydrogen evolution reaction are shown in Fig. S5 and are almost identical to those of SCM before the reaction, indicating the excellent stability of SCM.The activity for the CO2 reduction reaction was also used to confirm the enhancement of the photocatalytic performance.As shown in Fig. 4(c), the CO and CH4 yields of the hybrid samples were improved compared to those of pristine STO.Although SC-2 showed enhanced CO2 reduction activity, SCM showed further enhanced CO2 reduction performance.These results are consistent with the hydrogen evolution performance.The AQE of the SCM samples are shown in Fig. 4(d).The AQE of SCM at 365, 420, 475, 550, 600, and 700 nm are 19.70,13.76, 10.56, 7.95, 3.16, and 1.01, respectively.STO can be activated by UV light; thus, the AQE of SCM exhibited the highest value at 365 nm. In addition, the photoelectrochemical performance was optimized.The transient photocurrent response of SCM is remarkably higher than that of SC-2, which means that, in the former, the transfer efficiency of the photoexcited charge carrier pairs increased and more electrons were separated than in the latter, as shown in Fig. 4(e).In addition, the LSV curves of SCM (Fig. 4(f)) showed the highest onset potential, which is consistent with the photocatalytic performance.The EIS plots are shown in Fig. 4(g); SCM has the smallest semicircle radius, indicating that the charge transfer resistance inside SCM was smaller than those of SC-2 and STO.Pristine STO yielded the largest semicircle radius, that is, the largest charge transfer resistance, which can be attributed to fast carrier pair recombination.Therefore, the reduced charge transport resistance suggests enhanced charge transfer efficiency in the hybrid samples, especially the dual cocatalysts system, which helps to reduce the carrier pair recombination and boost photocatalytic hydrogen generation. To determine the influence of CoP and Mo2C on the optical properties of the STO NFs, UV-Vis DRS measurements of the as-prepared hybrid samples and pristine samples were carried out.UV-Vis DRS was performed to evaluate the band gap and optical properties of the samples.As shown in Fig. 4(h), pure CoP and Mo2C are dark materials with metallic characteristics; thus, the absorption edge could not be measured by UV-Vis DRS.Pristine STO exhibited an absorption edge at about 382.7 nm whereas the hybrid samples SC-2 and SCM exhibited an absorption edge at about 638.4 and 747.5 nm, respectively.The significant change in the absorption edge suggests that CoP and Mo2C improved the optical properties of the STO NFs.The bandgap of bare STO is approximately 3.24 eV, which is consistent with the plots of (h) 2 versus photon energy (h), as shown in Fig. 4(i).In contrast, the bandgap of SC-2 is 2.61 eV, which is much smaller than bare STO, and the bandgap of SCM was calculated at 2.52 eV presented the best light response property.These changes in the composite illustrate that CoP and Mo2C affect the light response range of the STO NFs. To investigate the mechanism of enhancement in the composites, it is necessary to determine the band structure of the components.The work function (Wf) of semiconductors is an important factor in predicting electron transfer within the interfaces.Therefore, UPS measurements were performed to determine the Wf and band structures of STO, CoP, and Mo2C 59,60.As shown in Fig. 5(a), the cut-off edges (Ecut-off) of STO, CoP, and Mo2C are 17.20, 15.80, and 16.30 eV.Next, the UPS results were used to determine the band structure of STO with an 21.22 eV excitation energy; thus, the Fermi levels (Ef) of STO, CoP, and Mo2C were determined to be -4.02,-5.42, and -4.92 eV, respectively.The Ef of Mo2C is located in the middle; therefore, electrons tend to flow from STO to Mo2C and then flow to CoP.The measured valence band maximum of STO is 2.34 eV, as shown in the inset; thus, the valence band position (EVB) of STO is -6.36 eV.The conduction band edge (ECB) of STO is equal to -3.12 eV according to the formula: ECB EVB -Eg.Thus, CoP and Mo2C are regarded as having metallic character on the basis of the UV-Vis DRS results (Fig. S6), as also shown in previous works 61. The working mechanism of the ISI-XPS measurements 62 is shown in Fig. 6(a).The samples were excited by X-rays, and the photoelectrons were detected by the detector.The number of photoelectrons differed when the samples were placed in the dark or under UV irradiation; thus, the binding energies (BE) were different.This is a result of shielding effects; specifically, the external electrons in an atom shield the inner electrons, and an increase in the outer layer electron density enhances the shielding effect, thereby decreasing the BE of a chemical bond.The BE shifts reflect photoexcited electron migration between the STO and CoP.When STO was excited by UV light, the photoexcited electrons were transferred from STO to CoP through the Schottky junction.Figs.6(b)-(e) illustrates the shielding effects of STO and CoP.The Sr 3p and Ti 2p orbitals were excited by UV light, and there were fewer outer electrons than those under dark conditions, resulting in weaker shielding and a BE shifted in the positive direction.In contrast, the shielding ef- Subsequently, ISI-XPS measurements were carried out to confirm the interfacial charge transfer between STO and CoP.The Sr 3p ISI-XPS spectrum of SC-2 is shown in Fig. 7(a).In the spectrum of SC-2 without UV light irradiation, two peaks at 269.620 and 279.966 eV were observed, and these correspond to Sr 3p3/2 and Sr 3p1/2 of SC-2, respectively.When the sample was irradiated with UV light, the BE increased slightly to 269.705 and 280.150 eV.Meanwhile, in the Ti 2p region, without UV light irradiation, the spectrum of SC-2 contains two peaks at 464.897 (Ti 2p3/2) and 459.228 eV (Ti 2p1/2).Under UV light irradiation, the peaks moved to higher BE.As mentioned, an increase in electron density should cause a decrease in the BE.In contrast, the loss of electrons increased the BE.The various BE in STO and CoP indicate electron migration during the hydrogen evolution process.These results indicate that STO is an electron donor in the hybrid sample.In contrast, both the BE of P 2s and that of Co 2p in CoP were reduced under UV light irradiation.This result illustrates that CoP can trap photoexcited electrons during the photocatalytic reaction process.Further, the change in BE is direct evidence of charge transfer between STO and CoP, and the results showed that STO loses electrons, whereas CoP obtains electrons.Based on the above ISI-XPS analysis, we concluded that CoP acted as an electron capturer and had a positive influence on the photocatalytic reaction. ISI-XPS was also employed to determine the changes in the BE and understand the electron migration of SCM.The spectra of the constituent elements (C, Sr, Ti, O, Co, P, and Mo) are presented in Fig. 8 The reason that Mo2C loses electrons in SCM can be revealed by the Ef positions of STO, CoP, and Mo2C.Depending on the relative position of Ef, electrons are transferred from a higher energy to a lower energy; in other words, electrons prefer to transfer from STO to CoP and Mo2C.The Ef of Mo2C is higher than that of CoP; thus, electrons were transferred from Mo2C to CoP.Based on the ISI-XPS analysis and UPS results, we concluded that Mo2C acted as a \"bridge\" for electron transfer from STO to CoP, and Mo2C is also helpful for enhancing the photocatalytic performance. Based on the UV-Vis DRS and UPS results, the band structures of STO, CoP, and Mo2C are proposed in Fig. 9.Under simulated solar irradiation, the photoexcited electrons of STO can be stimulated and move from the valence band to the conduction band, generating photoexcited electrons and holes.The photocatalytic mechanism of bare STO is shown in Fig. 9(a).The electrons transfer to the conduction band and reduce water to generate H2 or reduce CO2 to CO and CH4, and the holes remain in the valence band and are then consumed by TEOA.In pristine STO, most of the photoexcited electrons and holes rapidly recombine in the bulk, and only a few of the photoexcited electrons can transfer to the surface and participate in the photocatalytic reaction.This is the reason that pure STO has a low experimental activity.The photocatalytic mechanism of SC-2 is shown in Fig. 9(b).Owing to the good electronic conductivity of CoP and the higher Wf of STO, the migration rate of photoexcited electrons can be greatly improved, leading to photoexcited electron transfer and formation of a Schottky junction, followed by band bending and the formation of a Schottky barrier.The photoexcited electrons flow from the conduction band of STO to CoP and then participate in the reduction reaction on the surface of the CoP.Further, the Schottky barrier prevents photoexcited electrons from returning to STO.Therefore, the photoexcited electrons accumulated on the CoP and participate in the reduction reaction on the CoP surface.The generated holes that remain on the STO are consumed by TEOA.Thus, the photoexcited electrons and holes can be effectively separated and transferred into SC-2, which results in a remarkable enhancement in the photocatalytic performance.The photocatalytic mechanism in SCM is shown in Fig. 9(c).Thus, after constructing the dual cocatalyst system, the charge separation efficiency was remarkably improved compared to that of SC-2.In the dual cocatalyst system, the electrons flow from the conduction band of STO to Mo2C and then to CoP, thus prolonging the electron migration distance, reducing recombi- nation, and enhancing the catalytic performance."}, {"llm generation": "SCM", "source": "In summary, we have reported a dual catalysts system with embedded CoP and Mo2C on SrTiO3 NFs, referred to as SCM.", "context": "In summary, we have reported a dual catalysts system with embedded CoP and Mo2C on SrTiO3 NFs, referred to as SCM.As expected, the SCM NFs showed high hydrogen evolution efficiency: approximately seven times higher than that of STO NFs, and SCM also showed the best CO2 reduction activity.The ISI-XPS measurements under UV irradiation confirmed the interfacial charge transfer from STO to Mo2C, followed by transfer to CoP.The Schottky junction formed between STO and the cocatalysts greatly enhanced the separation of photoexcited electrons and holes, thus greatly enhancd the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution and CO2 reduction activity.Therefore, in this study, we have prepared an excellent stable photocatalyst, demonstrated the role of CoP and Mo2C in modifying wide-bandgap semiconductors, and also confirmed the spatial separation of photoexcited carriers between STO and the cocatalysts.

The hydrogen generation activity and cycling stability are two important factors for evaluating the photocatalytic performance of the samples.Therefore, the photocatalytic H2 generation activity of the samples was tested under simulated solar light irradiation.As shown in Fig. 3(b), the pure STO NFs have the lowest H2 evolution rate (0.14 mmol g -1 ) because of the fast recombination of photoexcited electrons and holes.All the CoP decorated samples had a higher hydrogen evolution rate than STO, indicating that the modification of CoP is favorable for photocatalytic performance.However, the water splitting performance first increased and then decreased with increase in the amount of CoP.A possible reason is that as more CoP covers the STO surface, less STO is exposed to light and fewer photogenerated charge pairs are produced.Compared with SC-1 (0.28 mmol g -1 ) and SC-3 (0.31 mmol g -1 ), SC-2 yielded the highest H2 evolution rate (0.43 mmol g -1 ), demonstrating that an appropriate amount of CoP is crucial.On the basis of these results, we propose that the excess CoP covering the STO NF surface blocks the light required to excite the STO to generate carriers, whereas a lower amount of cocatalyst results in a lack of active sites to capture photoexcited electrons.Therefore, an appropriate amount of CoP can improve the H2 evolution performance and maximize the use of light. The cycling stability of SC-2 is shown in Fig. 3(c).A slight decrease in the photocatalytic performance was observed after three cycles.However, when another 5 mL of sacrificial agent was added to the quartz reactor, the photocatalytic performance increased to the same level as the first two cycles, indicating that the samples show good stability for photocatalytic H2 generation via water splitting.In addition, SC-2 was collected after the cycling stability test, and the XRD pattern is shown in Fig. 3(e).The results indicate the composite had superior stability because the diffraction peaks of SC-2 did not change after a long reaction period.Thus, both the cycling tests and phase analysis show that SC-2 has excellent stability for hydrogen evolution.Moreover, CoP is an outstanding cocatalyst for STO, which enhances charge separation and H2 evolution. Transient photocurrent response measurements were used to investigate the transfer efficiency of the photoexcited carrier pairs.As shown in Fig. 3(f), pristine STO exhibited the lowest charge transfer efficiency.After hybridization with CoP, the transient photocurrent responses improved remarkably.As expected, SC-2 showed a much higher transient photocurrent response, which corresponds to the hydrogen production performance, than the other hybrid samples.The improvement in photocurrent density is due to the rapid charge transfer from the STO to CoP.The LSV plots were measured in a Na2SO4 solution, as shown in Fig. 3(g).Typically, the earlier the inflection point in the LSV curve, the lower the overpotential required for the catalytic reaction; that is, the photocatalytic reaction is more likely to occur.The onset potential of the hybrid samples is much higher than that of STO, which means that the photocatalytic reaction occurred more easily in the hybrid samples than in STO.Further, pure STO showed the lowest onset potential (-1.82 eV) vs. AgCl, whereas SC-1 and SC-3 yielded onset potentials of -1.66 and -1.62 eV, respectively, vs. AgCl.Com- pared with those of SC-1 and SC-3, SC-2 shows a higher onset potential, indicating a lower overpotential for H2 evolution. Based on the discussion above, hybridization with CoP improves the performance of STO by reducing the overpotential, thus facilitating H2 evolution.Next, PL spectra were obtained to characterize the recombination efficiency of the photoexcited charge-carrier pairs.As mentioned, generally, the emission peak intensity is related to the recombination efficiency of the photoexcited charge pairs.A higher emission intensity indicates a higher recombination of photoexcited charge carrier pairs.As illustrated in Fig. 3(h), the intensity of the emission peak of SC-2 is lower than that of STO, proving that the participation of CoP could effectively inhibit the recombination of photoexcited electron-hole pairs in STO, which is consistent with the transient photocurrent response measurement results.Thus, TPV measurements were performed to test the life, separation, and transfer efficiency of the photoexcited carriers on the surface and interface, as shown in Fig. 3(i).The TPV curve of pristine STO contains low-intensity peaks having a short lifespan, indicating the sluggish separation efficiency and short lifetime of the photogenerated carriers under laser irradiation with a wavelength of 355 nm.After modification with CoP yielding SC-2, the peak intensity was greatly enhanced and showed a plateau, which can be attributed to the accumulation of photoexcited electrons on the sur-face.Additionally, the lifespan of the photoexcited charges was significantly extended, suggesting effective charge migration and prolonged lifetimes.Therefore, the incorporation of STO and CoP can dramatically accelerate the transfer and prolong the lifetime of photogenerated charges owing to the Schottky junction. Although SC-2 showed outstanding photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity, it did not reach our expectations.Thus, we constructed a dual cocatalyst system to improve photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance.When we loaded Mo2C on the SC-2 NFs, the hydrogen generation performance of the hybrids was further improved.Figs.4(a) and (b) show a comparison of the H2 generation activities and cycling stability of SCM and SC-2.Although the addition of CoP improved the H2 yield, the addition of Mo2C further increased the H2 yield and cycling stability.Further, the photocatalyst performance doubled after constructing the dual cocatalysts system, thus achieving a better H2 evolution performance than SC-2.The H2 evolution of SCM decreased after four cycles; then, we added 5 mL of TEOA to the quartz reactor, and the photocatalytic performance increased to the same level as that in the first three cycles.The enhancement in the photocatalytic performance was attributed to the construction of the dual cocatalysts system, which is beneficial for charge migration; as a result, more charges can react rather than recombine.The XRD peaks of SCM after five cycles of the hydrogen evolution reaction are shown in Fig. S5 and are almost identical to those of SCM before the reaction, indicating the excellent stability of SCM.The activity for the CO2 reduction reaction was also used to confirm the enhancement of the photocatalytic performance.As shown in Fig. 4(c), the CO and CH4 yields of the hybrid samples were improved compared to those of pristine STO.Although SC-2 showed enhanced CO2 reduction activity, SCM showed further enhanced CO2 reduction performance.These results are consistent with the hydrogen evolution performance.The AQE of the SCM samples are shown in Fig. 4(d).The AQE of SCM at 365, 420, 475, 550, 600, and 700 nm are 19.70,13.76, 10.56, 7.95, 3.16, and 1.01, respectively.STO can be activated by UV light; thus, the AQE of SCM exhibited the highest value at 365 nm. In addition, the photoelectrochemical performance was optimized.The transient photocurrent response of SCM is remarkably higher than that of SC-2, which means that, in the former, the transfer efficiency of the photoexcited charge carrier pairs increased and more electrons were separated than in the latter, as shown in Fig. 4(e).In addition, the LSV curves of SCM (Fig. 4(f)) showed the highest onset potential, which is consistent with the photocatalytic performance.The EIS plots are shown in Fig. 4(g); SCM has the smallest semicircle radius, indicating that the charge transfer resistance inside SCM was smaller than those of SC-2 and STO.Pristine STO yielded the largest semicircle radius, that is, the largest charge transfer resistance, which can be attributed to fast carrier pair recombination.Therefore, the reduced charge transport resistance suggests enhanced charge transfer efficiency in the hybrid samples, especially the dual cocatalysts system, which helps to reduce the carrier pair recombination and boost photocatalytic hydrogen generation. To determine the influence of CoP and Mo2C on the optical properties of the STO NFs, UV-Vis DRS measurements of the as-prepared hybrid samples and pristine samples were carried out.UV-Vis DRS was performed to evaluate the band gap and optical properties of the samples.As shown in Fig. 4(h), pure CoP and Mo2C are dark materials with metallic characteristics; thus, the absorption edge could not be measured by UV-Vis DRS.Pristine STO exhibited an absorption edge at about 382.7 nm whereas the hybrid samples SC-2 and SCM exhibited an absorption edge at about 638.4 and 747.5 nm, respectively.The significant change in the absorption edge suggests that CoP and Mo2C improved the optical properties of the STO NFs.The bandgap of bare STO is approximately 3.24 eV, which is consistent with the plots of (h) 2 versus photon energy (h), as shown in Fig. 4(i).In contrast, the bandgap of SC-2 is 2.61 eV, which is much smaller than bare STO, and the bandgap of SCM was calculated at 2.52 eV presented the best light response property.These changes in the composite illustrate that CoP and Mo2C affect the light response range of the STO NFs. To investigate the mechanism of enhancement in the composites, it is necessary to determine the band structure of the components.The work function (Wf) of semiconductors is an important factor in predicting electron transfer within the interfaces.Therefore, UPS measurements were performed to determine the Wf and band structures of STO, CoP, and Mo2C 59,60.As shown in Fig. 5(a), the cut-off edges (Ecut-off) of STO, CoP, and Mo2C are 17.20, 15.80, and 16.30 eV.Next, the UPS results were used to determine the band structure of STO with an 21.22 eV excitation energy; thus, the Fermi levels (Ef) of STO, CoP, and Mo2C were determined to be -4.02,-5.42, and -4.92 eV, respectively.The Ef of Mo2C is located in the middle; therefore, electrons tend to flow from STO to Mo2C and then flow to CoP.The measured valence band maximum of STO is 2.34 eV, as shown in the inset; thus, the valence band position (EVB) of STO is -6.36 eV.The conduction band edge (ECB) of STO is equal to -3.12 eV according to the formula: ECB EVB -Eg.Thus, CoP and Mo2C are regarded as having metallic character on the basis of the UV-Vis DRS results (Fig. S6), as also shown in previous works 61. The working mechanism of the ISI-XPS measurements 62 is shown in Fig. 6(a).The samples were excited by X-rays, and the photoelectrons were detected by the detector.The number of photoelectrons differed when the samples were placed in the dark or under UV irradiation; thus, the binding energies (BE) were different.This is a result of shielding effects; specifically, the external electrons in an atom shield the inner electrons, and an increase in the outer layer electron density enhances the shielding effect, thereby decreasing the BE of a chemical bond.The BE shifts reflect photoexcited electron migration between the STO and CoP.When STO was excited by UV light, the photoexcited electrons were transferred from STO to CoP through the Schottky junction.Figs.6(b)-(e) illustrates the shielding effects of STO and CoP.The Sr 3p and Ti 2p orbitals were excited by UV light, and there were fewer outer electrons than those under dark conditions, resulting in weaker shielding and a BE shifted in the positive direction.In contrast, the shielding ef- Subsequently, ISI-XPS measurements were carried out to confirm the interfacial charge transfer between STO and CoP.The Sr 3p ISI-XPS spectrum of SC-2 is shown in Fig. 7(a).In the spectrum of SC-2 without UV light irradiation, two peaks at 269.620 and 279.966 eV were observed, and these correspond to Sr 3p3/2 and Sr 3p1/2 of SC-2, respectively.When the sample was irradiated with UV light, the BE increased slightly to 269.705 and 280.150 eV.Meanwhile, in the Ti 2p region, without UV light irradiation, the spectrum of SC-2 contains two peaks at 464.897 (Ti 2p3/2) and 459.228 eV (Ti 2p1/2).Under UV light irradiation, the peaks moved to higher BE.As mentioned, an increase in electron density should cause a decrease in the BE.In contrast, the loss of electrons increased the BE.The various BE in STO and CoP indicate electron migration during the hydrogen evolution process.These results indicate that STO is an electron donor in the hybrid sample.In contrast, both the BE of P 2s and that of Co 2p in CoP were reduced under UV light irradiation.This result illustrates that CoP can trap photoexcited electrons during the photocatalytic reaction process.Further, the change in BE is direct evidence of charge transfer between STO and CoP, and the results showed that STO loses electrons, whereas CoP obtains electrons.Based on the above ISI-XPS analysis, we concluded that CoP acted as an electron capturer and had a positive influence on the photocatalytic reaction. ISI-XPS was also employed to determine the changes in the BE and understand the electron migration of SCM.The spectra of the constituent elements (C, Sr, Ti, O, Co, P, and Mo) are presented in Fig. 8 The reason that Mo2C loses electrons in SCM can be revealed by the Ef positions of STO, CoP, and Mo2C.Depending on the relative position of Ef, electrons are transferred from a higher energy to a lower energy; in other words, electrons prefer to transfer from STO to CoP and Mo2C.The Ef of Mo2C is higher than that of CoP; thus, electrons were transferred from Mo2C to CoP.Based on the ISI-XPS analysis and UPS results, we concluded that Mo2C acted as a \"bridge\" for electron transfer from STO to CoP, and Mo2C is also helpful for enhancing the photocatalytic performance. Based on the UV-Vis DRS and UPS results, the band structures of STO, CoP, and Mo2C are proposed in Fig. 9.Under simulated solar irradiation, the photoexcited electrons of STO can be stimulated and move from the valence band to the conduction band, generating photoexcited electrons and holes.The photocatalytic mechanism of bare STO is shown in Fig. 9(a).The electrons transfer to the conduction band and reduce water to generate H2 or reduce CO2 to CO and CH4, and the holes remain in the valence band and are then consumed by TEOA.In pristine STO, most of the photoexcited electrons and holes rapidly recombine in the bulk, and only a few of the photoexcited electrons can transfer to the surface and participate in the photocatalytic reaction.This is the reason that pure STO has a low experimental activity.The photocatalytic mechanism of SC-2 is shown in Fig. 9(b).Owing to the good electronic conductivity of CoP and the higher Wf of STO, the migration rate of photoexcited electrons can be greatly improved, leading to photoexcited electron transfer and formation of a Schottky junction, followed by band bending and the formation of a Schottky barrier.The photoexcited electrons flow from the conduction band of STO to CoP and then participate in the reduction reaction on the surface of the CoP.Further, the Schottky barrier prevents photoexcited electrons from returning to STO.Therefore, the photoexcited electrons accumulated on the CoP and participate in the reduction reaction on the CoP surface.The generated holes that remain on the STO are consumed by TEOA.Thus, the photoexcited electrons and holes can be effectively separated and transferred into SC-2, which results in a remarkable enhancement in the photocatalytic performance.The photocatalytic mechanism in SCM is shown in Fig. 9(c).Thus, after constructing the dual cocatalyst system, the charge separation efficiency was remarkably improved compared to that of SC-2.In the dual cocatalyst system, the electrons flow from the conduction band of STO to Mo2C and then to CoP, thus prolonging the electron migration distance, reducing recombi- nation, and enhancing the catalytic performance."}, {"llm generation": "CoP", "source": "Therefore, in this study, we have prepared an excellent stable photocatalyst, demonstrated the role of CoP and Mo2C in modifying wide-bandgap semiconductors, and also confirmed the spatial separation of photoexcited carriers between STO and the cocatalysts.", "context": "In summary, we have reported a dual catalysts system with embedded CoP and Mo2C on SrTiO3 NFs, referred to as SCM.As expected, the SCM NFs showed high hydrogen evolution efficiency: approximately seven times higher than that of STO NFs, and SCM also showed the best CO2 reduction activity.The ISI-XPS measurements under UV irradiation confirmed the interfacial charge transfer from STO to Mo2C, followed by transfer to CoP.The Schottky junction formed between STO and the cocatalysts greatly enhanced the separation of photoexcited electrons and holes, thus greatly enhancd the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution and CO2 reduction activity.Therefore, in this study, we have prepared an excellent stable photocatalyst, demonstrated the role of CoP and Mo2C in modifying wide-bandgap semiconductors, and also confirmed the spatial separation of photoexcited carriers between STO and the cocatalysts.

An online analysis system (Lab Solar-IIIAG, Beijing Perfectlight Technology Co., Ltd.) was used for photocatalytic hydrogen production analysis and was connected to a gas chromatograph (Shimadzu GC-7806, TCD detector, 5-A molecular sieve column, Ar carrier).Typically, 20 mg of the catalyst sample was dispersed in a quartz reactor filled with 50 mL of pure water and 10 mL of the sacrificial agent (TEOA) in aqueous solution.The reactor was connected to an online analysis system and then placed.under vacuum.The reactor was exposed to simulated solar light supplied by a 300-W Xe lamp (Microsolar 300A, Xeon lamp).A gas chromatograph was used to monitor the hydrogen generation process in real time.The hydrogen produced in the quartz reactor was sent to the gas chromatograph every 30 min to obtain the average hydrogen generation rate.The CO2 reduction reactions were tested using the same constituents for hydrogen production.The reactor was pumped with CO2 gas to eject air and provide the CO2 for reaction.The reactor was then exposed to a 300-W Xe lamp for 2.5 h, and 1 mL of gas was injected into the gas chromatograph (Shimadzu GC-2014). The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) experiment of SCM was tested under the same conditions as the hydrogen evolution reaction and calculated using the following formulae 54: where nH2 represents the evolved number of H2 molecules, t 9000 s is the irradiation time, P is the calculated light power, h 6.63 10 -34 Js is the Planck constant, is the wavelength of the incident rays, and c 3.0 10 8 ms -1 is the speed of light. The transient photocurrent responses, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements of all samples were performed in a typical three-electrode system using an electrochemical workstation (CHI760E, Chenhua, Shanghai, China).Glassy carbon electrodes were used as the working electrodes, and Ag/AgCl and a platinum wire were used as the reference and auxiliary electrodes, respectively.The working electrode was prepared using a standard recipe: 3.0 mg of each sample was dispersed in 500 L isopropanol, 500 L deionized water, and 50 L Nafion solution and mixed to form a homogeneous slurry.Five microliters of the slurry was pipetted onto a glassy carbon electrode and dried at room temperature for approximately 12 h to prepare the working electrodes.The electrolyte was a 1 mol/L Na2SO4 aqueous solution."}, {"llm generation": "Simulated solar light", "source": "Therefore, the photocatalytic H2 generation activity of the samples was tested under simulated solar light irradiation.", "context": "Fig. 1(a) illustrates the synthetic process.XRD is a common characterization method used to determine the crystalline phases of materials.As shown in Fig. 1(b), the distinct diffraction peaks (2) at 22.8, 32.4, 40.0, 46.5, 52.4, 57.8, 67.8, 72.5, and 77.2 could be indexed to the (100), ( 110), ( 111), ( 200), ( 210), ( 211), ( 220), ( 300) and (310) lattice planes of SrTiO3, respectively.The XRD pattern of SC-2 is the same as that of pure STO (JCPDS no.35-0734), indicating that the introduction of CoP did not change the structure of STO, and the diffraction peaks for all STO/CoP NFs can be assigned to cubic SrTiO3.The diffraction peaks of CoP (JCPDS no.26-0481) and Mo2C (JCPDS no.35-0787) in SC-2 and SCM, respectively, can be barely seen, indicating that CoP and Mo2C were uniformly and finely distributed.On the basis of previous works 55,56, the (011) facet of CoP is the active site and tends to be more exposed than other facets.After decorating Mo2C on SC-2, the material was carbonized at 800 C, and the high temperature aided the growth of the CoP crystals.In addition, the high pressure and the introduction of Mo2C may lead to the lattice distortion of CoP, thus the peak had shifted.As a result, the XRD pattern of SCM showed a peak at approximately 31.Next, we increased the amount of CoP to 12.The XRD pattern of CoP is shown in Fig. S1(b), and that of Mo2C is shown in Fig. S1(c).By comparison of these XRD patterns, we determined that the STO/CoP NFs and SCM NFs had been synthesized successfully. SEM and TEM measurements were used to observe the morphology of STO and SCM.As shown in Fig. 2(a), pristine STO has a porous structure, which increases the number of reaction sites and the trapping of light.The TEM pattern of STO NFs is presented in Fig. 2(b), in which it can be seen that the STO was formed of a porous nanofiber structure covered with STO crystals.After loading with CoP and Mo2C, the SCM NFs became rough, and the EDS elemental mapping of SCM confirmed that CoP and Mo2C were evenly coated on the STO NFs.As shown in Fig. S2, Co, P, and Mo were homogeneously distributed throughout the STO NFs, indicating that CoP and Mo2C had successfully coated the STO NFs.The higher magnification patterns of a certain areas of the STO samples are presented in Figs.2(c) and(d).The lattice spacing of 0.276 nm can be attributed to the (110) plane of STO, illustrating the successful synthesis of STO.The high-resolution (HR)TEM images of SCM are presented in Figs.2(g) and (h), and three different lattice spacings of 0.276, 0.283, and 0.228 nm, corresponding to the (110) plane of STO, (011) plane of CoP, and (101) plane of Mo2C, respectively, were identified.The elemental distribution of SCM was determined using energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) elemental mapping.As clearly seen in Fig. 2(i), Co, P, and Mo were homogeneously distributed throughout the STO NFs, confirming that CoP and Mo2C were evenly coated on the STO NFs.Based on the HRTEM and elemental mapping, we concluded that the dual cocatalysts photocatalyst had been synthesized, and the cocatalysts were uniformly distributed on the surface of STO. In addition, N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms were obtained to investigate the specific surface areas of pristine STO (Fig. 3(a)).STO exhibited a type-IV isotherm pattern, and the specific surface area was 25.93 m 2 /g.The pore size distribution is shown in the inset, and the average pore size is 16.11 nm; thus, the STO NFs contain mesopores.The porous structure helps the sacrificial agent and water pass into the nanofibers, resulting in good contact with the catalyst during the reaction 57,58.Moreover, the porosity increases the number of reaction sites and the trapping of light. The hydrogen generation activity and cycling stability are two important factors for evaluating the photocatalytic performance of the samples.Therefore, the photocatalytic H2 generation activity of the samples was tested under simulated solar light irradiation.As shown in Fig. 3(b), the pure STO NFs have the lowest H2 evolution rate (0.14 mmol g -1 ) because of the fast recombination of photoexcited electrons and holes.All the CoP decorated samples had a higher hydrogen evolution rate than STO, indicating that the modification of CoP is favorable for photocatalytic performance.However, the water splitting performance first increased and then decreased with increase in the amount of CoP.A possible reason is that as more CoP covers the STO surface, less STO is exposed to light and fewer photogenerated charge pairs are produced.Compared with SC-1 (0.28 mmol g -1 ) and SC-3 (0.31 mmol g -1 ), SC-2 yielded the highest H2 evolution rate (0.43 mmol g -1 ), demonstrating that an appropriate amount of CoP is crucial.On the basis of these results, we propose that the excess CoP covering the STO NF surface blocks the light required to excite the STO to generate carriers, whereas a lower amount of cocatalyst results in a lack of active sites to capture photoexcited electrons.Therefore, an appropriate amount of CoP can improve the H2 evolution performance and maximize the use of light. The cycling stability of SC-2 is shown in Fig. 3(c).A slight decrease in the photocatalytic performance was observed after three cycles.However, when another 5 mL of sacrificial agent was added to the quartz reactor, the photocatalytic performance increased to the same level as the first two cycles, indicating that the samples show good stability for photocatalytic H2 generation via water splitting.In addition, SC-2 was collected after the cycling stability test, and the XRD pattern is shown in Fig. 3(e).The results indicate the composite had superior stability because the diffraction peaks of SC-2 did not change after a long reaction period.Thus, both the cycling tests and phase analysis show that SC-2 has excellent stability for hydrogen evolution.Moreover, CoP is an outstanding cocatalyst for STO, which enhances charge separation and H2 evolution. Transient photocurrent response measurements were used to investigate the transfer efficiency of the photoexcited carrier pairs.As shown in Fig. 3(f), pristine STO exhibited the lowest charge transfer efficiency.After hybridization with CoP, the transient photocurrent responses improved remarkably.As expected, SC-2 showed a much higher transient photocurrent response, which corresponds to the hydrogen production performance, than the other hybrid samples.The improvement in photocurrent density is due to the rapid charge transfer from the STO to CoP.The LSV plots were measured in a Na2SO4 solution, as shown in Fig. 3(g).Typically, the earlier the inflection point in the LSV curve, the lower the overpotential required for the catalytic reaction; that is, the photocatalytic reaction is more likely to occur.The onset potential of the hybrid samples is much higher than that of STO, which means that the photocatalytic reaction occurred more easily in the hybrid samples than in STO.Further, pure STO showed the lowest onset potential (-1.82 eV) vs. AgCl, whereas SC-1 and SC-3 yielded onset potentials of -1.66 and -1.62 eV, respectively, vs. AgCl.Com- pared with those of SC-1 and SC-3, SC-2 shows a higher onset potential, indicating a lower overpotential for H2 evolution. Based on the discussion above, hybridization with CoP improves the performance of STO by reducing the overpotential, thus facilitating H2 evolution.Next, PL spectra were obtained to characterize the recombination efficiency of the photoexcited charge-carrier pairs.As mentioned, generally, the emission peak intensity is related to the recombination efficiency of the photoexcited charge pairs.A higher emission intensity indicates a higher recombination of photoexcited charge carrier pairs.As illustrated in Fig. 3(h), the intensity of the emission peak of SC-2 is lower than that of STO, proving that the participation of CoP could effectively inhibit the recombination of photoexcited electron-hole pairs in STO, which is consistent with the transient photocurrent response measurement results.Thus, TPV measurements were performed to test the life, separation, and transfer efficiency of the photoexcited carriers on the surface and interface, as shown in Fig. 3(i).The TPV curve of pristine STO contains low-intensity peaks having a short lifespan, indicating the sluggish separation efficiency and short lifetime of the photogenerated carriers under laser irradiation with a wavelength of 355 nm.After modification with CoP yielding SC-2, the peak intensity was greatly enhanced and showed a plateau, which can be attributed to the accumulation of photoexcited electrons on the sur-face.Additionally, the lifespan of the photoexcited charges was significantly extended, suggesting effective charge migration and prolonged lifetimes.Therefore, the incorporation of STO and CoP can dramatically accelerate the transfer and prolong the lifetime of photogenerated charges owing to the Schottky junction. Although SC-2 showed outstanding photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity, it did not reach our expectations.Thus, we constructed a dual cocatalyst system to improve photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance.When we loaded Mo2C on the SC-2 NFs, the hydrogen generation performance of the hybrids was further improved.Figs.4(a) and (b) show a comparison of the H2 generation activities and cycling stability of SCM and SC-2.Although the addition of CoP improved the H2 yield, the addition of Mo2C further increased the H2 yield and cycling stability.Further, the photocatalyst performance doubled after constructing the dual cocatalysts system, thus achieving a better H2 evolution performance than SC-2.The H2 evolution of SCM decreased after four cycles; then, we added 5 mL of TEOA to the quartz reactor, and the photocatalytic performance increased to the same level as that in the first three cycles.The enhancement in the photocatalytic performance was attributed to the construction of the dual cocatalysts system, which is beneficial for charge migration; as a result, more charges can react rather than recombine.The XRD peaks of SCM after five cycles of the hydrogen evolution reaction are shown in Fig. S5 and are almost identical to those of SCM before the reaction, indicating the excellent stability of SCM.The activity for the CO2 reduction reaction was also used to confirm the enhancement of the photocatalytic performance.As shown in Fig. 4(c), the CO and CH4 yields of the hybrid samples were improved compared to those of pristine STO.Although SC-2 showed enhanced CO2 reduction activity, SCM showed further enhanced CO2 reduction performance.These results are consistent with the hydrogen evolution performance.The AQE of the SCM samples are shown in Fig. 4(d).The AQE of SCM at 365, 420, 475, 550, 600, and 700 nm are 19.70,13.76, 10.56, 7.95, 3.16, and 1.01, respectively.STO can be activated by UV light; thus, the AQE of SCM exhibited the highest value at 365 nm. In addition, the photoelectrochemical performance was optimized.The transient photocurrent response of SCM is remarkably higher than that of SC-2, which means that, in the former, the transfer efficiency of the photoexcited charge carrier pairs increased and more electrons were separated than in the latter, as shown in Fig. 4(e).In addition, the LSV curves of SCM (Fig. 4(f)) showed the highest onset potential, which is consistent with the photocatalytic performance.The EIS plots are shown in Fig. 4(g); SCM has the smallest semicircle radius, indicating that the charge transfer resistance inside SCM was smaller than those of SC-2 and STO.Pristine STO yielded the largest semicircle radius, that is, the largest charge transfer resistance, which can be attributed to fast carrier pair recombination.Therefore, the reduced charge transport resistance suggests enhanced charge transfer efficiency in the hybrid samples, especially the dual cocatalysts system, which helps to reduce the carrier pair recombination and boost photocatalytic hydrogen generation. To determine the influence of CoP and Mo2C on the optical properties of the STO NFs, UV-Vis DRS measurements of the as-prepared hybrid samples and pristine samples were carried out.UV-Vis DRS was performed to evaluate the band gap and optical properties of the samples.As shown in Fig. 4(h), pure CoP and Mo2C are dark materials with metallic characteristics; thus, the absorption edge could not be measured by UV-Vis DRS.Pristine STO exhibited an absorption edge at about 382.7 nm whereas the hybrid samples SC-2 and SCM exhibited an absorption edge at about 638.4 and 747.5 nm, respectively.The significant change in the absorption edge suggests that CoP and Mo2C improved the optical properties of the STO NFs.The bandgap of bare STO is approximately 3.24 eV, which is consistent with the plots of (h) 2 versus photon energy (h), as shown in Fig. 4(i).In contrast, the bandgap of SC-2 is 2.61 eV, which is much smaller than bare STO, and the bandgap of SCM was calculated at 2.52 eV presented the best light response property.These changes in the composite illustrate that CoP and Mo2C affect the light response range of the STO NFs. To investigate the mechanism of enhancement in the composites, it is necessary to determine the band structure of the components.The work function (Wf) of semiconductors is an important factor in predicting electron transfer within the interfaces.Therefore, UPS measurements were performed to determine the Wf and band structures of STO, CoP, and Mo2C 59,60.As shown in Fig. 5(a), the cut-off edges (Ecut-off) of STO, CoP, and Mo2C are 17.20, 15.80, and 16.30 eV.Next, the UPS results were used to determine the band structure of STO with an 21.22 eV excitation energy; thus, the Fermi levels (Ef) of STO, CoP, and Mo2C were determined to be -4.02,-5.42, and -4.92 eV, respectively.The Ef of Mo2C is located in the middle; therefore, electrons tend to flow from STO to Mo2C and then flow to CoP.The measured valence band maximum of STO is 2.34 eV, as shown in the inset; thus, the valence band position (EVB) of STO is -6.36 eV.The conduction band edge (ECB) of STO is equal to -3.12 eV according to the formula: ECB EVB -Eg.Thus, CoP and Mo2C are regarded as having metallic character on the basis of the UV-Vis DRS results (Fig. S6), as also shown in previous works 61. The working mechanism of the ISI-XPS measurements 62 is shown in Fig. 6(a).The samples were excited by X-rays, and the photoelectrons were detected by the detector.The number of photoelectrons differed when the samples were placed in the dark or under UV irradiation; thus, the binding energies (BE) were different.This is a result of shielding effects; specifically, the external electrons in an atom shield the inner electrons, and an increase in the outer layer electron density enhances the shielding effect, thereby decreasing the BE of a chemical bond.The BE shifts reflect photoexcited electron migration between the STO and CoP.When STO was excited by UV light, the photoexcited electrons were transferred from STO to CoP through the Schottky junction.Figs.6(b)-(e) illustrates the shielding effects of STO and CoP.The Sr 3p and Ti 2p orbitals were excited by UV light, and there were fewer outer electrons than those under dark conditions, resulting in weaker shielding and a BE shifted in the positive direction.In contrast, the shielding ef- Subsequently, ISI-XPS measurements were carried out to confirm the interfacial charge transfer between STO and CoP.The Sr 3p ISI-XPS spectrum of SC-2 is shown in Fig. 7(a).In the spectrum of SC-2 without UV light irradiation, two peaks at 269.620 and 279.966 eV were observed, and these correspond to Sr 3p3/2 and Sr 3p1/2 of SC-2, respectively.When the sample was irradiated with UV light, the BE increased slightly to 269.705 and 280.150 eV.Meanwhile, in the Ti 2p region, without UV light irradiation, the spectrum of SC-2 contains two peaks at 464.897 (Ti 2p3/2) and 459.228 eV (Ti 2p1/2).Under UV light irradiation, the peaks moved to higher BE.As mentioned, an increase in electron density should cause a decrease in the BE.In contrast, the loss of electrons increased the BE.The various BE in STO and CoP indicate electron migration during the hydrogen evolution process.These results indicate that STO is an electron donor in the hybrid sample.In contrast, both the BE of P 2s and that of Co 2p in CoP were reduced under UV light irradiation.This result illustrates that CoP can trap photoexcited electrons during the photocatalytic reaction process.Further, the change in BE is direct evidence of charge transfer between STO and CoP, and the results showed that STO loses electrons, whereas CoP obtains electrons.Based on the above ISI-XPS analysis, we concluded that CoP acted as an electron capturer and had a positive influence on the photocatalytic reaction. ISI-XPS was also employed to determine the changes in the BE and understand the electron migration of SCM.The spectra of the constituent elements (C, Sr, Ti, O, Co, P, and Mo) are presented in Fig. 8 The reason that Mo2C loses electrons in SCM can be revealed by the Ef positions of STO, CoP, and Mo2C.Depending on the relative position of Ef, electrons are transferred from a higher energy to a lower energy; in other words, electrons prefer to transfer from STO to CoP and Mo2C.The Ef of Mo2C is higher than that of CoP; thus, electrons were transferred from Mo2C to CoP.Based on the ISI-XPS analysis and UPS results, we concluded that Mo2C acted as a \"bridge\" for electron transfer from STO to CoP, and Mo2C is also helpful for enhancing the photocatalytic performance. Based on the UV-Vis DRS and UPS results, the band structures of STO, CoP, and Mo2C are proposed in Fig. 9.Under simulated solar irradiation, the photoexcited electrons of STO can be stimulated and move from the valence band to the conduction band, generating photoexcited electrons and holes.The photocatalytic mechanism of bare STO is shown in Fig. 9(a).The electrons transfer to the conduction band and reduce water to generate H2 or reduce CO2 to CO and CH4, and the holes remain in the valence band and are then consumed by TEOA.In pristine STO, most of the photoexcited electrons and holes rapidly recombine in the bulk, and only a few of the photoexcited electrons can transfer to the surface and participate in the photocatalytic reaction.This is the reason that pure STO has a low experimental activity.The photocatalytic mechanism of SC-2 is shown in Fig. 9(b).Owing to the good electronic conductivity of CoP and the higher Wf of STO, the migration rate of photoexcited electrons can be greatly improved, leading to photoexcited electron transfer and formation of a Schottky junction, followed by band bending and the formation of a Schottky barrier.The photoexcited electrons flow from the conduction band of STO to CoP and then participate in the reduction reaction on the surface of the CoP.Further, the Schottky barrier prevents photoexcited electrons from returning to STO.Therefore, the photoexcited electrons accumulated on the CoP and participate in the reduction reaction on the CoP surface.The generated holes that remain on the STO are consumed by TEOA.Thus, the photoexcited electrons and holes can be effectively separated and transferred into SC-2, which results in a remarkable enhancement in the photocatalytic performance.The photocatalytic mechanism in SCM is shown in Fig. 9(c).Thus, after constructing the dual cocatalyst system, the charge separation efficiency was remarkably improved compared to that of SC-2.In the dual cocatalyst system, the electrons flow from the conduction band of STO to Mo2C and then to CoP, thus prolonging the electron migration distance, reducing recombi- nation, and enhancing the catalytic performance."}, {"llm generation": "Monochromatic (laser irradiation with a wavelength of 355 nm)", "source": "The TPV curve of pristine STO contains low-intensity peaks having a short lifespan, indicating the sluggish separation efficiency and short lifetime of the photogenerated carriers under laser irradiation with a wavelength of 355 nm.", "context": "Fig. 1(a) illustrates the synthetic process.XRD is a common characterization method used to determine the crystalline phases of materials.As shown in Fig. 1(b), the distinct diffraction peaks (2) at 22.8, 32.4, 40.0, 46.5, 52.4, 57.8, 67.8, 72.5, and 77.2 could be indexed to the (100), ( 110), ( 111), ( 200), ( 210), ( 211), ( 220), ( 300) and (310) lattice planes of SrTiO3, respectively.The XRD pattern of SC-2 is the same as that of pure STO (JCPDS no.35-0734), indicating that the introduction of CoP did not change the structure of STO, and the diffraction peaks for all STO/CoP NFs can be assigned to cubic SrTiO3.The diffraction peaks of CoP (JCPDS no.26-0481) and Mo2C (JCPDS no.35-0787) in SC-2 and SCM, respectively, can be barely seen, indicating that CoP and Mo2C were uniformly and finely distributed.On the basis of previous works 55,56, the (011) facet of CoP is the active site and tends to be more exposed than other facets.After decorating Mo2C on SC-2, the material was carbonized at 800 C, and the high temperature aided the growth of the CoP crystals.In addition, the high pressure and the introduction of Mo2C may lead to the lattice distortion of CoP, thus the peak had shifted.As a result, the XRD pattern of SCM showed a peak at approximately 31.Next, we increased the amount of CoP to 12.The XRD pattern of CoP is shown in Fig. S1(b), and that of Mo2C is shown in Fig. S1(c).By comparison of these XRD patterns, we determined that the STO/CoP NFs and SCM NFs had been synthesized successfully. SEM and TEM measurements were used to observe the morphology of STO and SCM.As shown in Fig. 2(a), pristine STO has a porous structure, which increases the number of reaction sites and the trapping of light.The TEM pattern of STO NFs is presented in Fig. 2(b), in which it can be seen that the STO was formed of a porous nanofiber structure covered with STO crystals.After loading with CoP and Mo2C, the SCM NFs became rough, and the EDS elemental mapping of SCM confirmed that CoP and Mo2C were evenly coated on the STO NFs.As shown in Fig. S2, Co, P, and Mo were homogeneously distributed throughout the STO NFs, indicating that CoP and Mo2C had successfully coated the STO NFs.The higher magnification patterns of a certain areas of the STO samples are presented in Figs.2(c) and(d).The lattice spacing of 0.276 nm can be attributed to the (110) plane of STO, illustrating the successful synthesis of STO.The high-resolution (HR)TEM images of SCM are presented in Figs.2(g) and (h), and three different lattice spacings of 0.276, 0.283, and 0.228 nm, corresponding to the (110) plane of STO, (011) plane of CoP, and (101) plane of Mo2C, respectively, were identified.The elemental distribution of SCM was determined using energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) elemental mapping.As clearly seen in Fig. 2(i), Co, P, and Mo were homogeneously distributed throughout the STO NFs, confirming that CoP and Mo2C were evenly coated on the STO NFs.Based on the HRTEM and elemental mapping, we concluded that the dual cocatalysts photocatalyst had been synthesized, and the cocatalysts were uniformly distributed on the surface of STO. In addition, N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms were obtained to investigate the specific surface areas of pristine STO (Fig. 3(a)).STO exhibited a type-IV isotherm pattern, and the specific surface area was 25.93 m 2 /g.The pore size distribution is shown in the inset, and the average pore size is 16.11 nm; thus, the STO NFs contain mesopores.The porous structure helps the sacrificial agent and water pass into the nanofibers, resulting in good contact with the catalyst during the reaction 57,58.Moreover, the porosity increases the number of reaction sites and the trapping of light. The hydrogen generation activity and cycling stability are two important factors for evaluating the photocatalytic performance of the samples.Therefore, the photocatalytic H2 generation activity of the samples was tested under simulated solar light irradiation.As shown in Fig. 3(b), the pure STO NFs have the lowest H2 evolution rate (0.14 mmol g -1 ) because of the fast recombination of photoexcited electrons and holes.All the CoP decorated samples had a higher hydrogen evolution rate than STO, indicating that the modification of CoP is favorable for photocatalytic performance.However, the water splitting performance first increased and then decreased with increase in the amount of CoP.A possible reason is that as more CoP covers the STO surface, less STO is exposed to light and fewer photogenerated charge pairs are produced.Compared with SC-1 (0.28 mmol g -1 ) and SC-3 (0.31 mmol g -1 ), SC-2 yielded the highest H2 evolution rate (0.43 mmol g -1 ), demonstrating that an appropriate amount of CoP is crucial.On the basis of these results, we propose that the excess CoP covering the STO NF surface blocks the light required to excite the STO to generate carriers, whereas a lower amount of cocatalyst results in a lack of active sites to capture photoexcited electrons.Therefore, an appropriate amount of CoP can improve the H2 evolution performance and maximize the use of light. The cycling stability of SC-2 is shown in Fig. 3(c).A slight decrease in the photocatalytic performance was observed after three cycles.However, when another 5 mL of sacrificial agent was added to the quartz reactor, the photocatalytic performance increased to the same level as the first two cycles, indicating that the samples show good stability for photocatalytic H2 generation via water splitting.In addition, SC-2 was collected after the cycling stability test, and the XRD pattern is shown in Fig. 3(e).The results indicate the composite had superior stability because the diffraction peaks of SC-2 did not change after a long reaction period.Thus, both the cycling tests and phase analysis show that SC-2 has excellent stability for hydrogen evolution.Moreover, CoP is an outstanding cocatalyst for STO, which enhances charge separation and H2 evolution. Transient photocurrent response measurements were used to investigate the transfer efficiency of the photoexcited carrier pairs.As shown in Fig. 3(f), pristine STO exhibited the lowest charge transfer efficiency.After hybridization with CoP, the transient photocurrent responses improved remarkably.As expected, SC-2 showed a much higher transient photocurrent response, which corresponds to the hydrogen production performance, than the other hybrid samples.The improvement in photocurrent density is due to the rapid charge transfer from the STO to CoP.The LSV plots were measured in a Na2SO4 solution, as shown in Fig. 3(g).Typically, the earlier the inflection point in the LSV curve, the lower the overpotential required for the catalytic reaction; that is, the photocatalytic reaction is more likely to occur.The onset potential of the hybrid samples is much higher than that of STO, which means that the photocatalytic reaction occurred more easily in the hybrid samples than in STO.Further, pure STO showed the lowest onset potential (-1.82 eV) vs. AgCl, whereas SC-1 and SC-3 yielded onset potentials of -1.66 and -1.62 eV, respectively, vs. AgCl.Com- pared with those of SC-1 and SC-3, SC-2 shows a higher onset potential, indicating a lower overpotential for H2 evolution. Based on the discussion above, hybridization with CoP improves the performance of STO by reducing the overpotential, thus facilitating H2 evolution.Next, PL spectra were obtained to characterize the recombination efficiency of the photoexcited charge-carrier pairs.As mentioned, generally, the emission peak intensity is related to the recombination efficiency of the photoexcited charge pairs.A higher emission intensity indicates a higher recombination of photoexcited charge carrier pairs.As illustrated in Fig. 3(h), the intensity of the emission peak of SC-2 is lower than that of STO, proving that the participation of CoP could effectively inhibit the recombination of photoexcited electron-hole pairs in STO, which is consistent with the transient photocurrent response measurement results.Thus, TPV measurements were performed to test the life, separation, and transfer efficiency of the photoexcited carriers on the surface and interface, as shown in Fig. 3(i).The TPV curve of pristine STO contains low-intensity peaks having a short lifespan, indicating the sluggish separation efficiency and short lifetime of the photogenerated carriers under laser irradiation with a wavelength of 355 nm.After modification with CoP yielding SC-2, the peak intensity was greatly enhanced and showed a plateau, which can be attributed to the accumulation of photoexcited electrons on the sur-face.Additionally, the lifespan of the photoexcited charges was significantly extended, suggesting effective charge migration and prolonged lifetimes.Therefore, the incorporation of STO and CoP can dramatically accelerate the transfer and prolong the lifetime of photogenerated charges owing to the Schottky junction. Although SC-2 showed outstanding photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity, it did not reach our expectations.Thus, we constructed a dual cocatalyst system to improve photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance.When we loaded Mo2C on the SC-2 NFs, the hydrogen generation performance of the hybrids was further improved.Figs.4(a) and (b) show a comparison of the H2 generation activities and cycling stability of SCM and SC-2.Although the addition of CoP improved the H2 yield, the addition of Mo2C further increased the H2 yield and cycling stability.Further, the photocatalyst performance doubled after constructing the dual cocatalysts system, thus achieving a better H2 evolution performance than SC-2.The H2 evolution of SCM decreased after four cycles; then, we added 5 mL of TEOA to the quartz reactor, and the photocatalytic performance increased to the same level as that in the first three cycles.The enhancement in the photocatalytic performance was attributed to the construction of the dual cocatalysts system, which is beneficial for charge migration; as a result, more charges can react rather than recombine.The XRD peaks of SCM after five cycles of the hydrogen evolution reaction are shown in Fig. S5 and are almost identical to those of SCM before the reaction, indicating the excellent stability of SCM.The activity for the CO2 reduction reaction was also used to confirm the enhancement of the photocatalytic performance.As shown in Fig. 4(c), the CO and CH4 yields of the hybrid samples were improved compared to those of pristine STO.Although SC-2 showed enhanced CO2 reduction activity, SCM showed further enhanced CO2 reduction performance.These results are consistent with the hydrogen evolution performance.The AQE of the SCM samples are shown in Fig. 4(d).The AQE of SCM at 365, 420, 475, 550, 600, and 700 nm are 19.70,13.76, 10.56, 7.95, 3.16, and 1.01, respectively.STO can be activated by UV light; thus, the AQE of SCM exhibited the highest value at 365 nm. In addition, the photoelectrochemical performance was optimized.The transient photocurrent response of SCM is remarkably higher than that of SC-2, which means that, in the former, the transfer efficiency of the photoexcited charge carrier pairs increased and more electrons were separated than in the latter, as shown in Fig. 4(e).In addition, the LSV curves of SCM (Fig. 4(f)) showed the highest onset potential, which is consistent with the photocatalytic performance.The EIS plots are shown in Fig. 4(g); SCM has the smallest semicircle radius, indicating that the charge transfer resistance inside SCM was smaller than those of SC-2 and STO.Pristine STO yielded the largest semicircle radius, that is, the largest charge transfer resistance, which can be attributed to fast carrier pair recombination.Therefore, the reduced charge transport resistance suggests enhanced charge transfer efficiency in the hybrid samples, especially the dual cocatalysts system, which helps to reduce the carrier pair recombination and boost photocatalytic hydrogen generation. To determine the influence of CoP and Mo2C on the optical properties of the STO NFs, UV-Vis DRS measurements of the as-prepared hybrid samples and pristine samples were carried out.UV-Vis DRS was performed to evaluate the band gap and optical properties of the samples.As shown in Fig. 4(h), pure CoP and Mo2C are dark materials with metallic characteristics; thus, the absorption edge could not be measured by UV-Vis DRS.Pristine STO exhibited an absorption edge at about 382.7 nm whereas the hybrid samples SC-2 and SCM exhibited an absorption edge at about 638.4 and 747.5 nm, respectively.The significant change in the absorption edge suggests that CoP and Mo2C improved the optical properties of the STO NFs.The bandgap of bare STO is approximately 3.24 eV, which is consistent with the plots of (h) 2 versus photon energy (h), as shown in Fig. 4(i).In contrast, the bandgap of SC-2 is 2.61 eV, which is much smaller than bare STO, and the bandgap of SCM was calculated at 2.52 eV presented the best light response property.These changes in the composite illustrate that CoP and Mo2C affect the light response range of the STO NFs. To investigate the mechanism of enhancement in the composites, it is necessary to determine the band structure of the components.The work function (Wf) of semiconductors is an important factor in predicting electron transfer within the interfaces.Therefore, UPS measurements were performed to determine the Wf and band structures of STO, CoP, and Mo2C 59,60.As shown in Fig. 5(a), the cut-off edges (Ecut-off) of STO, CoP, and Mo2C are 17.20, 15.80, and 16.30 eV.Next, the UPS results were used to determine the band structure of STO with an 21.22 eV excitation energy; thus, the Fermi levels (Ef) of STO, CoP, and Mo2C were determined to be -4.02,-5.42, and -4.92 eV, respectively.The Ef of Mo2C is located in the middle; therefore, electrons tend to flow from STO to Mo2C and then flow to CoP.The measured valence band maximum of STO is 2.34 eV, as shown in the inset; thus, the valence band position (EVB) of STO is -6.36 eV.The conduction band edge (ECB) of STO is equal to -3.12 eV according to the formula: ECB EVB -Eg.Thus, CoP and Mo2C are regarded as having metallic character on the basis of the UV-Vis DRS results (Fig. S6), as also shown in previous works 61. The working mechanism of the ISI-XPS measurements 62 is shown in Fig. 6(a).The samples were excited by X-rays, and the photoelectrons were detected by the detector.The number of photoelectrons differed when the samples were placed in the dark or under UV irradiation; thus, the binding energies (BE) were different.This is a result of shielding effects; specifically, the external electrons in an atom shield the inner electrons, and an increase in the outer layer electron density enhances the shielding effect, thereby decreasing the BE of a chemical bond.The BE shifts reflect photoexcited electron migration between the STO and CoP.When STO was excited by UV light, the photoexcited electrons were transferred from STO to CoP through the Schottky junction.Figs.6(b)-(e) illustrates the shielding effects of STO and CoP.The Sr 3p and Ti 2p orbitals were excited by UV light, and there were fewer outer electrons than those under dark conditions, resulting in weaker shielding and a BE shifted in the positive direction.In contrast, the shielding ef- Subsequently, ISI-XPS measurements were carried out to confirm the interfacial charge transfer between STO and CoP.The Sr 3p ISI-XPS spectrum of SC-2 is shown in Fig. 7(a).In the spectrum of SC-2 without UV light irradiation, two peaks at 269.620 and 279.966 eV were observed, and these correspond to Sr 3p3/2 and Sr 3p1/2 of SC-2, respectively.When the sample was irradiated with UV light, the BE increased slightly to 269.705 and 280.150 eV.Meanwhile, in the Ti 2p region, without UV light irradiation, the spectrum of SC-2 contains two peaks at 464.897 (Ti 2p3/2) and 459.228 eV (Ti 2p1/2).Under UV light irradiation, the peaks moved to higher BE.As mentioned, an increase in electron density should cause a decrease in the BE.In contrast, the loss of electrons increased the BE.The various BE in STO and CoP indicate electron migration during the hydrogen evolution process.These results indicate that STO is an electron donor in the hybrid sample.In contrast, both the BE of P 2s and that of Co 2p in CoP were reduced under UV light irradiation.This result illustrates that CoP can trap photoexcited electrons during the photocatalytic reaction process.Further, the change in BE is direct evidence of charge transfer between STO and CoP, and the results showed that STO loses electrons, whereas CoP obtains electrons.Based on the above ISI-XPS analysis, we concluded that CoP acted as an electron capturer and had a positive influence on the photocatalytic reaction. ISI-XPS was also employed to determine the changes in the BE and understand the electron migration of SCM.The spectra of the constituent elements (C, Sr, Ti, O, Co, P, and Mo) are presented in Fig. 8 The reason that Mo2C loses electrons in SCM can be revealed by the Ef positions of STO, CoP, and Mo2C.Depending on the relative position of Ef, electrons are transferred from a higher energy to a lower energy; in other words, electrons prefer to transfer from STO to CoP and Mo2C.The Ef of Mo2C is higher than that of CoP; thus, electrons were transferred from Mo2C to CoP.Based on the ISI-XPS analysis and UPS results, we concluded that Mo2C acted as a \"bridge\" for electron transfer from STO to CoP, and Mo2C is also helpful for enhancing the photocatalytic performance. Based on the UV-Vis DRS and UPS results, the band structures of STO, CoP, and Mo2C are proposed in Fig. 9.Under simulated solar irradiation, the photoexcited electrons of STO can be stimulated and move from the valence band to the conduction band, generating photoexcited electrons and holes.The photocatalytic mechanism of bare STO is shown in Fig. 9(a).The electrons transfer to the conduction band and reduce water to generate H2 or reduce CO2 to CO and CH4, and the holes remain in the valence band and are then consumed by TEOA.In pristine STO, most of the photoexcited electrons and holes rapidly recombine in the bulk, and only a few of the photoexcited electrons can transfer to the surface and participate in the photocatalytic reaction.This is the reason that pure STO has a low experimental activity.The photocatalytic mechanism of SC-2 is shown in Fig. 9(b).Owing to the good electronic conductivity of CoP and the higher Wf of STO, the migration rate of photoexcited electrons can be greatly improved, leading to photoexcited electron transfer and formation of a Schottky junction, followed by band bending and the formation of a Schottky barrier.The photoexcited electrons flow from the conduction band of STO to CoP and then participate in the reduction reaction on the surface of the CoP.Further, the Schottky barrier prevents photoexcited electrons from returning to STO.Therefore, the photoexcited electrons accumulated on the CoP and participate in the reduction reaction on the CoP surface.The generated holes that remain on the STO are consumed by TEOA.Thus, the photoexcited electrons and holes can be effectively separated and transferred into SC-2, which results in a remarkable enhancement in the photocatalytic performance.The photocatalytic mechanism in SCM is shown in Fig. 9(c).Thus, after constructing the dual cocatalyst system, the charge separation efficiency was remarkably improved compared to that of SC-2.In the dual cocatalyst system, the electrons flow from the conduction band of STO to Mo2C and then to CoP, thus prolonging the electron migration distance, reducing recombi- nation, and enhancing the catalytic performance."}], "lamp": [{"llm generation": "Xenon", "source": "The reactor was exposed to simulated solar light supplied by a 300-W Xe lamp (Microsolar 300A, Xeon lamp).", "context": "Strontium acetate (Sr(Ac)24H2O), triethanolamine (TEOA), and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) were purchased from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd.Ethanol, ammonia solution (NH3H2O), acetic acid, N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), isopropanol, cobalt acetate tetrahydrate (Co(Ac)24H2O), ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate ((NH4)5Mo7O244H2O), and sodium hypophosphite monohydrate (NaH2PO2H2O) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.Tetrabutyl titanate (TBOT) was purchased from Tianjin Kermel Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd and commercial Nafion 117 solution (DuPont, 5 wt) was purchased from Aladdin Reagent Co., Ltd.Glucose (C6H12O6) was purchased from Tianjin Fengchuan Chemical Reagent Technology Co., Ltd.All chemical reagents were of analytical grade and were used without any purification. The SrTiO3 NFs were synthesized by the electrospinning method according to previous reports with some modifications.Briefly, PVP (1.0 g) and Sr(Ac)24H2O (0.361 g) were first dissolved in a mixture of 3 mL of DMF, 2 mL of deionized water, 2 mL of acetic acid, and 3 mL of ethanol.After magnetic stirring for 12 h at room temperature, 0.6 mL TBOT was added to the mixture, which was then magnetically stirred for 1 h.The obtained precursor solution was injected into a syringe using a controlled electrospinning setup.The distance between the needle tip and the collector plate was approximately 20 cm, and the high-voltage power was set to 15 kV.After several hours, the formed white polymer film was collected and calcined at 600 C for 3 h at a heating rate of 2 Cmin -1 in air.The white product is SrTiO3 NFs, denoted STO.

The micromorphology and microstructure of the samples were obtained using field-emission scanning microscopy (FE-SEM, ZEISS SIGMA-500) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI Tecnai G20).The crystal structures of the samples were determined using powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Rigaku Ultima IV system with Cu radiation ( 1.54056A) at 50 kV and 200 mA between 2 values of 20 and 80 at a scanning rate of 20min -1 .The UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-Vis DRS) were measured on a UV3600 UV-Vis spectrometer (SHIMADZU) with BaSO4 as the reference.Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured using a spectrophotometer (F-280 fluorescence photometer) under ultraviolet light excitation.X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), UPS, and ISI-XPS measurements were performed using an AXIS Supra (Kratos Analytical Inc.).UPS measurements were performed with a He I radiation source (h 21.22 eV).The ISI-XPS measurements were carried out under 365 nm UV irradiation during the XPS tests.The TPV was tested using a 355-nm laser irradiation pulse having a pulse width of 4 ns (Brilliant Easy series modular YAG laser, Quantel Inc.).The TPV signals were recorded using a 500 MHz digital phosphor oscilloscope (TDS 3054C, Tektronix).The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms were analyzed using a Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analyzer (Micromeritics ASAP 2460). An online analysis system (Lab Solar-IIIAG, Beijing Perfectlight Technology Co., Ltd.) was used for photocatalytic hydrogen production analysis and was connected to a gas chromatograph (Shimadzu GC-7806, TCD detector, 5-A molecular sieve column, Ar carrier).Typically, 20 mg of the catalyst sample was dispersed in a quartz reactor filled with 50 mL of pure water and 10 mL of the sacrificial agent (TEOA) in aqueous solution.The reactor was connected to an online analysis system and then placed.under vacuum.The reactor was exposed to simulated solar light supplied by a 300-W Xe lamp (Microsolar 300A, Xeon lamp).A gas chromatograph was used to monitor the hydrogen generation process in real time.The hydrogen produced in the quartz reactor was sent to the gas chromatograph every 30 min to obtain the average hydrogen generation rate.The CO2 reduction reactions were tested using the same constituents for hydrogen production.The reactor was pumped with CO2 gas to eject air and provide the CO2 for reaction.The reactor was then exposed to a 300-W Xe lamp for 2.5 h, and 1 mL of gas was injected into the gas chromatograph (Shimadzu GC-2014). The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) experiment of SCM was tested under the same conditions as the hydrogen evolution reaction and calculated using the following formulae 54: where nH2 represents the evolved number of H2 molecules, t 9000 s is the irradiation time, P is the calculated light power, h 6.63 10 -34 Js is the Planck constant, is the wavelength of the incident rays, and c 3.0 10 8 ms -1 is the speed of light. The transient photocurrent responses, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements of all samples were performed in a typical three-electrode system using an electrochemical workstation (CHI760E, Chenhua, Shanghai, China).Glassy carbon electrodes were used as the working electrodes, and Ag/AgCl and a platinum wire were used as the reference and auxiliary electrodes, respectively.The working electrode was prepared using a standard recipe: 3.0 mg of each sample was dispersed in 500 L isopropanol, 500 L deionized water, and 50 L Nafion solution and mixed to form a homogeneous slurry.Five microliters of the slurry was pipetted onto a glassy carbon electrode and dried at room temperature for approximately 12 h to prepare the working electrodes.The electrolyte was a 1 mol/L Na2SO4 aqueous solution."}], "reaction medium": [{"llm generation": "Liquid (Na2SO4 solution)", "source": "The LSV plots were measured in a Na2SO4 solution, as shown in Fig. 3(g).", "context": "Fig. 1(a) illustrates the synthetic process.XRD is a common characterization method used to determine the crystalline phases of materials.As shown in Fig. 1(b), the distinct diffraction peaks (2) at 22.8, 32.4, 40.0, 46.5, 52.4, 57.8, 67.8, 72.5, and 77.2 could be indexed to the (100), ( 110), ( 111), ( 200), ( 210), ( 211), ( 220), ( 300) and (310) lattice planes of SrTiO3, respectively.The XRD pattern of SC-2 is the same as that of pure STO (JCPDS no.35-0734), indicating that the introduction of CoP did not change the structure of STO, and the diffraction peaks for all STO/CoP NFs can be assigned to cubic SrTiO3.The diffraction peaks of CoP (JCPDS no.26-0481) and Mo2C (JCPDS no.35-0787) in SC-2 and SCM, respectively, can be barely seen, indicating that CoP and Mo2C were uniformly and finely distributed.On the basis of previous works 55,56, the (011) facet of CoP is the active site and tends to be more exposed than other facets.After decorating Mo2C on SC-2, the material was carbonized at 800 C, and the high temperature aided the growth of the CoP crystals.In addition, the high pressure and the introduction of Mo2C may lead to the lattice distortion of CoP, thus the peak had shifted.As a result, the XRD pattern of SCM showed a peak at approximately 31.Next, we increased the amount of CoP to 12.The XRD pattern of CoP is shown in Fig. S1(b), and that of Mo2C is shown in Fig. S1(c).By comparison of these XRD patterns, we determined that the STO/CoP NFs and SCM NFs had been synthesized successfully. SEM and TEM measurements were used to observe the morphology of STO and SCM.As shown in Fig. 2(a), pristine STO has a porous structure, which increases the number of reaction sites and the trapping of light.The TEM pattern of STO NFs is presented in Fig. 2(b), in which it can be seen that the STO was formed of a porous nanofiber structure covered with STO crystals.After loading with CoP and Mo2C, the SCM NFs became rough, and the EDS elemental mapping of SCM confirmed that CoP and Mo2C were evenly coated on the STO NFs.As shown in Fig. S2, Co, P, and Mo were homogeneously distributed throughout the STO NFs, indicating that CoP and Mo2C had successfully coated the STO NFs.The higher magnification patterns of a certain areas of the STO samples are presented in Figs.2(c) and(d).The lattice spacing of 0.276 nm can be attributed to the (110) plane of STO, illustrating the successful synthesis of STO.The high-resolution (HR)TEM images of SCM are presented in Figs.2(g) and (h), and three different lattice spacings of 0.276, 0.283, and 0.228 nm, corresponding to the (110) plane of STO, (011) plane of CoP, and (101) plane of Mo2C, respectively, were identified.The elemental distribution of SCM was determined using energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) elemental mapping.As clearly seen in Fig. 2(i), Co, P, and Mo were homogeneously distributed throughout the STO NFs, confirming that CoP and Mo2C were evenly coated on the STO NFs.Based on the HRTEM and elemental mapping, we concluded that the dual cocatalysts photocatalyst had been synthesized, and the cocatalysts were uniformly distributed on the surface of STO. In addition, N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms were obtained to investigate the specific surface areas of pristine STO (Fig. 3(a)).STO exhibited a type-IV isotherm pattern, and the specific surface area was 25.93 m 2 /g.The pore size distribution is shown in the inset, and the average pore size is 16.11 nm; thus, the STO NFs contain mesopores.The porous structure helps the sacrificial agent and water pass into the nanofibers, resulting in good contact with the catalyst during the reaction 57,58.Moreover, the porosity increases the number of reaction sites and the trapping of light. The hydrogen generation activity and cycling stability are two important factors for evaluating the photocatalytic performance of the samples.Therefore, the photocatalytic H2 generation activity of the samples was tested under simulated solar light irradiation.As shown in Fig. 3(b), the pure STO NFs have the lowest H2 evolution rate (0.14 mmol g -1 ) because of the fast recombination of photoexcited electrons and holes.All the CoP decorated samples had a higher hydrogen evolution rate than STO, indicating that the modification of CoP is favorable for photocatalytic performance.However, the water splitting performance first increased and then decreased with increase in the amount of CoP.A possible reason is that as more CoP covers the STO surface, less STO is exposed to light and fewer photogenerated charge pairs are produced.Compared with SC-1 (0.28 mmol g -1 ) and SC-3 (0.31 mmol g -1 ), SC-2 yielded the highest H2 evolution rate (0.43 mmol g -1 ), demonstrating that an appropriate amount of CoP is crucial.On the basis of these results, we propose that the excess CoP covering the STO NF surface blocks the light required to excite the STO to generate carriers, whereas a lower amount of cocatalyst results in a lack of active sites to capture photoexcited electrons.Therefore, an appropriate amount of CoP can improve the H2 evolution performance and maximize the use of light. The cycling stability of SC-2 is shown in Fig. 3(c).A slight decrease in the photocatalytic performance was observed after three cycles.However, when another 5 mL of sacrificial agent was added to the quartz reactor, the photocatalytic performance increased to the same level as the first two cycles, indicating that the samples show good stability for photocatalytic H2 generation via water splitting.In addition, SC-2 was collected after the cycling stability test, and the XRD pattern is shown in Fig. 3(e).The results indicate the composite had superior stability because the diffraction peaks of SC-2 did not change after a long reaction period.Thus, both the cycling tests and phase analysis show that SC-2 has excellent stability for hydrogen evolution.Moreover, CoP is an outstanding cocatalyst for STO, which enhances charge separation and H2 evolution. Transient photocurrent response measurements were used to investigate the transfer efficiency of the photoexcited carrier pairs.As shown in Fig. 3(f), pristine STO exhibited the lowest charge transfer efficiency.After hybridization with CoP, the transient photocurrent responses improved remarkably.As expected, SC-2 showed a much higher transient photocurrent response, which corresponds to the hydrogen production performance, than the other hybrid samples.The improvement in photocurrent density is due to the rapid charge transfer from the STO to CoP.The LSV plots were measured in a Na2SO4 solution, as shown in Fig. 3(g).Typically, the earlier the inflection point in the LSV curve, the lower the overpotential required for the catalytic reaction; that is, the photocatalytic reaction is more likely to occur.The onset potential of the hybrid samples is much higher than that of STO, which means that the photocatalytic reaction occurred more easily in the hybrid samples than in STO.Further, pure STO showed the lowest onset potential (-1.82 eV) vs. AgCl, whereas SC-1 and SC-3 yielded onset potentials of -1.66 and -1.62 eV, respectively, vs. AgCl.Com- pared with those of SC-1 and SC-3, SC-2 shows a higher onset potential, indicating a lower overpotential for H2 evolution. Based on the discussion above, hybridization with CoP improves the performance of STO by reducing the overpotential, thus facilitating H2 evolution.Next, PL spectra were obtained to characterize the recombination efficiency of the photoexcited charge-carrier pairs.As mentioned, generally, the emission peak intensity is related to the recombination efficiency of the photoexcited charge pairs.A higher emission intensity indicates a higher recombination of photoexcited charge carrier pairs.As illustrated in Fig. 3(h), the intensity of the emission peak of SC-2 is lower than that of STO, proving that the participation of CoP could effectively inhibit the recombination of photoexcited electron-hole pairs in STO, which is consistent with the transient photocurrent response measurement results.Thus, TPV measurements were performed to test the life, separation, and transfer efficiency of the photoexcited carriers on the surface and interface, as shown in Fig. 3(i).The TPV curve of pristine STO contains low-intensity peaks having a short lifespan, indicating the sluggish separation efficiency and short lifetime of the photogenerated carriers under laser irradiation with a wavelength of 355 nm.After modification with CoP yielding SC-2, the peak intensity was greatly enhanced and showed a plateau, which can be attributed to the accumulation of photoexcited electrons on the sur-face.Additionally, the lifespan of the photoexcited charges was significantly extended, suggesting effective charge migration and prolonged lifetimes.Therefore, the incorporation of STO and CoP can dramatically accelerate the transfer and prolong the lifetime of photogenerated charges owing to the Schottky junction. Although SC-2 showed outstanding photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity, it did not reach our expectations.Thus, we constructed a dual cocatalyst system to improve photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance.When we loaded Mo2C on the SC-2 NFs, the hydrogen generation performance of the hybrids was further improved.Figs.4(a) and (b) show a comparison of the H2 generation activities and cycling stability of SCM and SC-2.Although the addition of CoP improved the H2 yield, the addition of Mo2C further increased the H2 yield and cycling stability.Further, the photocatalyst performance doubled after constructing the dual cocatalysts system, thus achieving a better H2 evolution performance than SC-2.The H2 evolution of SCM decreased after four cycles; then, we added 5 mL of TEOA to the quartz reactor, and the photocatalytic performance increased to the same level as that in the first three cycles.The enhancement in the photocatalytic performance was attributed to the construction of the dual cocatalysts system, which is beneficial for charge migration; as a result, more charges can react rather than recombine.The XRD peaks of SCM after five cycles of the hydrogen evolution reaction are shown in Fig. S5 and are almost identical to those of SCM before the reaction, indicating the excellent stability of SCM.The activity for the CO2 reduction reaction was also used to confirm the enhancement of the photocatalytic performance.As shown in Fig. 4(c), the CO and CH4 yields of the hybrid samples were improved compared to those of pristine STO.Although SC-2 showed enhanced CO2 reduction activity, SCM showed further enhanced CO2 reduction performance.These results are consistent with the hydrogen evolution performance.The AQE of the SCM samples are shown in Fig. 4(d).The AQE of SCM at 365, 420, 475, 550, 600, and 700 nm are 19.70,13.76, 10.56, 7.95, 3.16, and 1.01, respectively.STO can be activated by UV light; thus, the AQE of SCM exhibited the highest value at 365 nm. In addition, the photoelectrochemical performance was optimized.The transient photocurrent response of SCM is remarkably higher than that of SC-2, which means that, in the former, the transfer efficiency of the photoexcited charge carrier pairs increased and more electrons were separated than in the latter, as shown in Fig. 4(e).In addition, the LSV curves of SCM (Fig. 4(f)) showed the highest onset potential, which is consistent with the photocatalytic performance.The EIS plots are shown in Fig. 4(g); SCM has the smallest semicircle radius, indicating that the charge transfer resistance inside SCM was smaller than those of SC-2 and STO.Pristine STO yielded the largest semicircle radius, that is, the largest charge transfer resistance, which can be attributed to fast carrier pair recombination.Therefore, the reduced charge transport resistance suggests enhanced charge transfer efficiency in the hybrid samples, especially the dual cocatalysts system, which helps to reduce the carrier pair recombination and boost photocatalytic hydrogen generation. To determine the influence of CoP and Mo2C on the optical properties of the STO NFs, UV-Vis DRS measurements of the as-prepared hybrid samples and pristine samples were carried out.UV-Vis DRS was performed to evaluate the band gap and optical properties of the samples.As shown in Fig. 4(h), pure CoP and Mo2C are dark materials with metallic characteristics; thus, the absorption edge could not be measured by UV-Vis DRS.Pristine STO exhibited an absorption edge at about 382.7 nm whereas the hybrid samples SC-2 and SCM exhibited an absorption edge at about 638.4 and 747.5 nm, respectively.The significant change in the absorption edge suggests that CoP and Mo2C improved the optical properties of the STO NFs.The bandgap of bare STO is approximately 3.24 eV, which is consistent with the plots of (h) 2 versus photon energy (h), as shown in Fig. 4(i).In contrast, the bandgap of SC-2 is 2.61 eV, which is much smaller than bare STO, and the bandgap of SCM was calculated at 2.52 eV presented the best light response property.These changes in the composite illustrate that CoP and Mo2C affect the light response range of the STO NFs. To investigate the mechanism of enhancement in the composites, it is necessary to determine the band structure of the components.The work function (Wf) of semiconductors is an important factor in predicting electron transfer within the interfaces.Therefore, UPS measurements were performed to determine the Wf and band structures of STO, CoP, and Mo2C 59,60.As shown in Fig. 5(a), the cut-off edges (Ecut-off) of STO, CoP, and Mo2C are 17.20, 15.80, and 16.30 eV.Next, the UPS results were used to determine the band structure of STO with an 21.22 eV excitation energy; thus, the Fermi levels (Ef) of STO, CoP, and Mo2C were determined to be -4.02,-5.42, and -4.92 eV, respectively.The Ef of Mo2C is located in the middle; therefore, electrons tend to flow from STO to Mo2C and then flow to CoP.The measured valence band maximum of STO is 2.34 eV, as shown in the inset; thus, the valence band position (EVB) of STO is -6.36 eV.The conduction band edge (ECB) of STO is equal to -3.12 eV according to the formula: ECB EVB -Eg.Thus, CoP and Mo2C are regarded as having metallic character on the basis of the UV-Vis DRS results (Fig. S6), as also shown in previous works 61. The working mechanism of the ISI-XPS measurements 62 is shown in Fig. 6(a).The samples were excited by X-rays, and the photoelectrons were detected by the detector.The number of photoelectrons differed when the samples were placed in the dark or under UV irradiation; thus, the binding energies (BE) were different.This is a result of shielding effects; specifically, the external electrons in an atom shield the inner electrons, and an increase in the outer layer electron density enhances the shielding effect, thereby decreasing the BE of a chemical bond.The BE shifts reflect photoexcited electron migration between the STO and CoP.When STO was excited by UV light, the photoexcited electrons were transferred from STO to CoP through the Schottky junction.Figs.6(b)-(e) illustrates the shielding effects of STO and CoP.The Sr 3p and Ti 2p orbitals were excited by UV light, and there were fewer outer electrons than those under dark conditions, resulting in weaker shielding and a BE shifted in the positive direction.In contrast, the shielding ef- Subsequently, ISI-XPS measurements were carried out to confirm the interfacial charge transfer between STO and CoP.The Sr 3p ISI-XPS spectrum of SC-2 is shown in Fig. 7(a).In the spectrum of SC-2 without UV light irradiation, two peaks at 269.620 and 279.966 eV were observed, and these correspond to Sr 3p3/2 and Sr 3p1/2 of SC-2, respectively.When the sample was irradiated with UV light, the BE increased slightly to 269.705 and 280.150 eV.Meanwhile, in the Ti 2p region, without UV light irradiation, the spectrum of SC-2 contains two peaks at 464.897 (Ti 2p3/2) and 459.228 eV (Ti 2p1/2).Under UV light irradiation, the peaks moved to higher BE.As mentioned, an increase in electron density should cause a decrease in the BE.In contrast, the loss of electrons increased the BE.The various BE in STO and CoP indicate electron migration during the hydrogen evolution process.These results indicate that STO is an electron donor in the hybrid sample.In contrast, both the BE of P 2s and that of Co 2p in CoP were reduced under UV light irradiation.This result illustrates that CoP can trap photoexcited electrons during the photocatalytic reaction process.Further, the change in BE is direct evidence of charge transfer between STO and CoP, and the results showed that STO loses electrons, whereas CoP obtains electrons.Based on the above ISI-XPS analysis, we concluded that CoP acted as an electron capturer and had a positive influence on the photocatalytic reaction. ISI-XPS was also employed to determine the changes in the BE and understand the electron migration of SCM.The spectra of the constituent elements (C, Sr, Ti, O, Co, P, and Mo) are presented in Fig. 8 The reason that Mo2C loses electrons in SCM can be revealed by the Ef positions of STO, CoP, and Mo2C.Depending on the relative position of Ef, electrons are transferred from a higher energy to a lower energy; in other words, electrons prefer to transfer from STO to CoP and Mo2C.The Ef of Mo2C is higher than that of CoP; thus, electrons were transferred from Mo2C to CoP.Based on the ISI-XPS analysis and UPS results, we concluded that Mo2C acted as a \"bridge\" for electron transfer from STO to CoP, and Mo2C is also helpful for enhancing the photocatalytic performance. Based on the UV-Vis DRS and UPS results, the band structures of STO, CoP, and Mo2C are proposed in Fig. 9.Under simulated solar irradiation, the photoexcited electrons of STO can be stimulated and move from the valence band to the conduction band, generating photoexcited electrons and holes.The photocatalytic mechanism of bare STO is shown in Fig. 9(a).The electrons transfer to the conduction band and reduce water to generate H2 or reduce CO2 to CO and CH4, and the holes remain in the valence band and are then consumed by TEOA.In pristine STO, most of the photoexcited electrons and holes rapidly recombine in the bulk, and only a few of the photoexcited electrons can transfer to the surface and participate in the photocatalytic reaction.This is the reason that pure STO has a low experimental activity.The photocatalytic mechanism of SC-2 is shown in Fig. 9(b).Owing to the good electronic conductivity of CoP and the higher Wf of STO, the migration rate of photoexcited electrons can be greatly improved, leading to photoexcited electron transfer and formation of a Schottky junction, followed by band bending and the formation of a Schottky barrier.The photoexcited electrons flow from the conduction band of STO to CoP and then participate in the reduction reaction on the surface of the CoP.Further, the Schottky barrier prevents photoexcited electrons from returning to STO.Therefore, the photoexcited electrons accumulated on the CoP and participate in the reduction reaction on the CoP surface.The generated holes that remain on the STO are consumed by TEOA.Thus, the photoexcited electrons and holes can be effectively separated and transferred into SC-2, which results in a remarkable enhancement in the photocatalytic performance.The photocatalytic mechanism in SCM is shown in Fig. 9(c).Thus, after constructing the dual cocatalyst system, the charge separation efficiency was remarkably improved compared to that of SC-2.In the dual cocatalyst system, the electrons flow from the conduction band of STO to Mo2C and then to CoP, thus prolonging the electron migration distance, reducing recombi- nation, and enhancing the catalytic performance."}], "reactor type": [], "operation mode": []}}
