Ltd.Foamed nickel was supplied by Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Beijing Co. Ltd.All chemicals were analytical reagent grade and used as received without further purification.Water used in all experiment was distilled and deionized. Graphite oxide was obtained by a modified Hummer's method 26.Firstly, graphite powder (5 g, 325 mesh) and NaNO 3 (2.5 g) were put into a 0 C solution of concentrated H 2 SO 4 (120 mL).Then, KMnO 4 (15 g) was slowly added under ice-water bath about 10 min.The mixture was kept at 0 C for 2 h.Afterward, the mixture was stirred at 35 C for 2 h.Then 200 mL of distilled water was added while the temperature was kept at 98 C for 1.5 h, the solution changed into brilliant yellow, accompanied by the generation of bubbles.The suspension was further diluted to approximately 1 L with distilled water and treated with 30 wt of H 2 O 2 to colorless aiming at reducing the residual permanganate and manganese dioxide.The mixture was filtered and washed with diluted HCl aqueous solution (5 wt, 1 L) and deionized water in turn to remove metal ions, until the pH value approached neutral.The graphite oxide was obtained after freeze drying. The synthesis of the BiVO 4 /RGO nanocomposites involved two steps as in Scheme 1.In the first step, 0.2 g, 0.3 g, 0.4 g, 0.6 g of graphite oxide was dispersed into 200 mL of mixed solution of water and ethanol at the ratio of 1:1 under magnetic stirring to get graphite oxide suspension.And then the suspension was centrifuged at 1000 r/min for 5 min to get one of the experimental materials after discarding the precipitation.In the second step, 0.18 g of Bi(NO 3 ) 3 A5H 2 O and 0.043 g of NH 4 VO 3 were added into 10 mL of absolute ethanol and stirred over 30 min at room temperature respectively.Then the Bi(NO 3 ) 3 A5H 2 O ethanol solution was put into 20 mL of graphite oxide suspension and magnetically stirred for 10 min.Then the NH 4 VO 3 solution was put into above suspension, adjusted the pH value to 10 with ammonia solution and stirred for 40 min.The resulting mixture was transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave at 180 C for 6 h.After the system was cooled to room temperature, the suspension was centrifuged, washed with absolute ethanol for five times to remove soluble by-products, and dried in a vacuum oven at 60 C for 12 h.These products were labeled as BiVO 4 /RGO20, BiVO 4 / RGO30, BiVO 4 /RGO40 and BiVO 4 /RGO60 respectively. For comparison, same method was used to synthesize RGO without adding Bi(NO 3 ) 3 A5H 2 O and NH4VO 3 .Pure BiVO 4 nanomaterials were synthesized with same process in absence of graphite oxide. The photo-catalytic activity of the as-prepared catalysts was measured by the photo-reduction of K 2 Cr 2 O 7 (Cr (VI)) solution under the illumination of simulated solar light at ambient temperature.In a typical reaction, 100 mg of the catalyst was dispersed in 100 mL of a 10 mg/L Cr (VI) solution under ultrasonication for 3 min.And then the pH value of the system was adjusted to 3 by 0.75 mol/L of HNO 3 .Before illumination, the mixture was magnetically stirred for 30 min in the dark to establish adsorption-desorption equilibrium of the dye and the catalyst.A solar simulator with a 500 W Xe lamp was used as the light source.The experimental suspension was placed in a quartz cuvette and placed at a distance of 200 mm from the light source.At given intervals, 3 mL of the suspension was withdrawn and centrifuged to remove the dispersed catalyst powder.The concentration of the clean transparent solution was determined by measuring the absorbance of Cr (VI) at 540 nm using spectrophotometer.The linear relationship between the absorbance and the concentration of Cr (VI) was shown in Fig The photo-reduction of CO 2 was carried out in a glass apparatus, where a glass cell with the light source placed in the middle equipped with a water-cooled jacket.Catalyst concentration was 1 g/L in 100 mL of 0.1 M NaOH aqueous solution.A solar simulator with a 500 W Xe lamp was used as the light source.Prior to the illumination, CO 2 was bubbled with a constant flow through the stirred suspension for at least 30 min to purge the air and saturate the solution.The reactor was tightly closed.The samples of liquid reaction mixture were taken in different interval during the irradiation.A spot of the suspension were withdrawn by a syringe, filtered through a Millipore filter membrane and analyzed.There might be many products to create in whole process.In this paper, ethanol as a typical product was used to characterize the photo reduction effect 27.The formation of ethanol was determined by a gas chromatography equipped with FID using a 50 m long KB-FFAP column.Three blank reactions were performed to ensure that the hydrocarbon production was due to the photo reduction of CO 2 and eliminate the surrounding interference.In the same experimental conditions, the first blank was illuminated without catalyst, the second blank was in the dark with catalyst and the third was illuminated with catalyst in absence of CO 2 .No hydrocarbons were detected in the above blank tests. The morphologies of the products were characterized by transmission electron microscope (TEM, H-800).The samples for TEM were prepared by dispersing the product in ethanol using a sonicator bath for 15 min and dropped on copper grid for observation.The dried products were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) on a D/max 2500 VB2/PC Advance diffractometer with Cu Ka radiation at a slow scan rate of 0.021/s to determine the structure.FT-IR spectra were measured on a Nicolet 6700 FT-IR spectrometer with KBr pellets as the sample matrix.UV-Vis spectra (UV-Vis) of the solid samples were recorded on a UV-3600 spectrophotometer, and the solution samples were recorded on a UV-5200PC spectrophotometer.Raman spectra were collected on an INVIA Raman microprobe (Renishaw Instruments, England) with 718 nm laser excitation.The photo-luminescence emission spectra were characterized on an F-7000 PL spectrometer with 365 nm laser excitation.The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out on a CHI660E workstation using a three-electrode system.The working electrode was prepared by mixing the BiVO 4 or BiVO 4 /RGO, carbon black (Super-P) and PTFE at a weight ratio of 85:10:5 to get the paste followed by the paste being pasted onto foamed nickel, pressed and dried under vacuum at 120 C for 12 h."}, {"llm generation": "BiVO 4 /RGO nanocomposites", "source": "The as-synthesized BiVO 4 /RGO nanocomposites exhibited higher photo-catalytic activity on the photo-reduction Cr (VI) and CO 2 than pure BiVO 4 under simulated solar light irradiation.", "context": "In summary, BiVO 4 /RGO nanocomposites with higher photoreduction performance were prepared via hydrothermal method with graphite oxide, Bi(NO 3 ) 3 and NH 4 VO 3 as precursors.The graphite oxide sheets were fully exfoliated, reduced and decorated with BiVO 4 lamellas during hydrothermal process.The as-synthesized BiVO 4 /RGO nanocomposites exhibited higher photo-catalytic activity on the photo-reduction Cr (VI) and CO 2 than pure BiVO 4 under simulated solar light irradiation.This work not only demonstrates that RGO is a very promising candidate for the development of high-performance photo-catalysts but also opens new possibilities to provide some insight into the design of new modified photocatalysts with high activity for environmental purification and other applications.

The morphologies of the products were characterized by transmission electron microscope (TEM, H-800).The samples for TEM were prepared by dispersing the product in ethanol using a sonicator bath for 15 min and dropped on copper grid for observation.The dried products were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) on a D/max 2500 VB2/PC Advance diffractometer with Cu Ka radiation at a slow scan rate of 0.021/s to determine the structure.FT-IR spectra were measured on a Nicolet 6700 FT-IR spectrometer with KBr pellets as the sample matrix.UV-Vis spectra (UV-Vis) of the solid samples were recorded on a UV-3600 spectrophotometer, and the solution samples were recorded on a UV-5200PC spectrophotometer.Raman spectra were collected on an INVIA Raman microprobe (Renishaw Instruments, England) with 718 nm laser excitation.The photo-luminescence emission spectra were characterized on an F-7000 PL spectrometer with 365 nm laser excitation.The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out on a CHI660E workstation using a three-electrode system.The working electrode was prepared by mixing the BiVO 4 or BiVO 4 /RGO, carbon black (Super-P) and PTFE at a weight ratio of 85:10:5 to get the paste followed by the paste being pasted onto foamed nickel, pressed and dried under vacuum at 120 C for 12 h."}], "reaction medium": [{"llm generation": "Liquid", "source": "In a typical reaction, 100 mg of the catalyst was dispersed in 100 mL of a 10 mg/L Cr (VI) solution under ultrasonication for 3 min.", "context": "Pristine graphite powder was commercially obtained from XF NANO.hydrochloric acid (HCl, 36.0-38.0wt), hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 , 30 wt), sulfuric acid (H 2 SO 4 , 95-98 wt), potassium permanganate (KMnO 4 ), NaOH, NaNO 3 , absolute ethanol, ethylene glycol, ammonia solution, carbon black (Super-P), PTFE and NH 3- AH 2 O were supplied by Beijing Chemical Plant.Bi(NO 3 ) 3 A5H 2 O and NH 4 VO 3 were purchased from Xilong Chemical Co.

Graphite oxide was obtained by a modified Hummer's method 26.Firstly, graphite powder (5 g, 325 mesh) and NaNO 3 (2.5 g) were put into a 0 C solution of concentrated H 2 SO 4 (120 mL).Then, KMnO 4 (15 g) was slowly added under ice-water bath about 10 min.The mixture was kept at 0 C for 2 h.Afterward, the mixture was stirred at 35 C for 2 h.Then 200 mL of distilled water was added while the temperature was kept at 98 C for 1.5 h, the solution changed into brilliant yellow, accompanied by the generation of bubbles.The suspension was further diluted to approximately 1 L with distilled water and treated with 30 wt of H 2 O 2 to colorless aiming at reducing the residual permanganate and manganese dioxide.The mixture was filtered and washed with diluted HCl aqueous solution (5 wt, 1 L) and deionized water in turn to remove metal ions, until the pH value approached neutral.The graphite oxide was obtained after freeze drying. The synthesis of the BiVO 4 /RGO nanocomposites involved two steps as in Scheme 1.In the first step, 0.2 g, 0.3 g, 0.4 g, 0.6 g of graphite oxide was dispersed into 200 mL of mixed solution of water and ethanol at the ratio of 1:1 under magnetic stirring to get graphite oxide suspension.And then the suspension was centrifuged at 1000 r/min for 5 min to get one of the experimental materials after discarding the precipitation.In the second step, 0.18 g of Bi(NO 3 ) 3 A5H 2 O and 0.043 g of NH 4 VO 3 were added into 10 mL of absolute ethanol and stirred over 30 min at room temperature respectively.Then the Bi(NO 3 ) 3 A5H 2 O ethanol solution was put into 20 mL of graphite oxide suspension and magnetically stirred for 10 min.Then the NH 4 VO 3 solution was put into above suspension, adjusted the pH value to 10 with ammonia solution and stirred for 40 min.The resulting mixture was transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave at 180 C for 6 h.After the system was cooled to room temperature, the suspension was centrifuged, washed with absolute ethanol for five times to remove soluble by-products, and dried in a vacuum oven at 60 C for 12 h.These products were labeled as BiVO 4 /RGO20, BiVO 4 / RGO30, BiVO 4 /RGO40 and BiVO 4 /RGO60 respectively.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns are used to further study the changes in structure.Fig. 2 shows the XRD results of pure BiVO 4 particles and BiVO 4 /RGO40 composites.It can be seen that almost all the diffraction peaks can be assigned to monoclinic BiVO 4 (JCPDS 14-0688) 7,28.Three peaks centered at 19.0, 35.2, and 46.0belonging to the monoclinic scheelite structure's iconic twin peaks of BiVO 4 29 can be clearly observed in the patterns of the BiVO 4 particles and BiVO 4 /RGO40 composites.What's more, BiVO 4 particles' peaks are all the same as the BiVO 4 /RGO40 composites.No peak of RGO is observed in composites.This is due to graphene oxide sheets are reduced to RGO under the hydrothermal conditions in the presence of alcohols, which usually appear no XRD peak 30.On the other hand, the peak of RGO might be hided by the peaks of Bi particles.The VO 3 (A) is transferred to VO 4 (A) and graphite oxide to RGO during hydrothermal process without extra reluctant and reduction step, verifying the hydrothermal method is high efficient, simple and green in the composites preparation. UV-Vis absorption spectra are an informative and important technique to determine the change in the absorption of the semiconductor photo-catalysts.The optical properties of BiVO 4 nano-particles and BiVO 4 /RGO nanocomposites were investigated by the UV-Vis spectroscopy, as shown in Fig. 3.According to the spectra, the pure BiVO 4 nanoparticles have strong absorption in the UV region and a broad adsorption band from 250 to 480 nm.However, there is an enhanced absorbance in the visible light region for the BiVO 4 /RGO nanocomposites.The band gap energies (E g ) of pure BiVO 4 and BiVO 4 /RGO composites can be estimated from the wavelength values corresponding to the intersection point of the vertical and horizontal parts of the spectra using the following equation: E g hc/k, where E g is the band gap energy (eV), h is the Planck's constant, c is the light velocity (m/s), and k is the wavelength (nm).The band gap energies of BiVO 4 , BiVO 4 /RGO 20, BiVO 4 /RGO 30, BiVO 4 / RGO 40 and BiVO 4 /RGO60 are 2.43 eV, 2.30 eV, 2.10 eV, 1.99 and 2.05 eV respectively, shown in Table 1.Therefore, the best proportion of BiVO 4 and GO is 40.The same result can also be found in photo-reduction of Cr (VI) in Fig. 8. Therefore, the above results indicate that the BiVO 4 /RGO nanocomposites can be excited to produce much more electron-hole pairs than BiVO 4 under simulated solar light, which has higher photo-catalytic activity. FT-IR spectrum is an informative and important technique to determine the change of the functional group of material.FT-IR spectra of graphite oxide, RGO, BiVO 4 and BiVO 4 /RGO40 are shown in Fig. 4. The graphite oxide spectrum shows the presence of various oxygen-containing groups.The peaks at 1701 cm A1 , 1219 cm A1 and 1049 cm A1 are assigned to CO, CAO, and COC vibrations, respectively.The peak at 1621 cm A1 is due to the skeletal vibration of un-oxidized graphitic domains or the remaining sp 2 carbon character of graphite 31.In comparison with the graphite oxide, the absorption peaks of OH group (3404 cm A1 ) and epoxide group (1390 cm A1 ) become weak, the absorption peaks of CAO, and CO oriented from COOH groups at 1072 cm A1 and 1720 cm A1 are absent in the IR spectrum of RGO.These results indicate that the graphite oxide has been reduced to a great extent (theoretical model predicted that the complete reduction may be difficult 32).In comparison with BiVO 4 /RGO40, pure BiVO 4 and RGO, it is showed that the BiVO 4 /RGO40 composites are made up of RGO and BiVO 4 particles. Fluorescence spectra have been widely used to investigate the efficiency of charge carrier trapping, immigration and transfer, and to reflect the fate of photo-generated electron-hole pairs from semiconductor particles under light illumination 33.Fig. 5 shows the fluorescence spectra of BiVO 4 and BiVO 4 /RGO40 nanocomposites.The fluorescence emission is excited by the recombination of electrons-hole, the weak intensity of fluorescence shows that the recombination rate of electronic-hole is lower.The fluorescence spectrum intensity of BiVO 4 sample is higher than BiVO 4 /RGO40 nanocomposites, indicating that the electron-hole pair's recombination rate for BiVO 4 /RGO40 composites is lower and more photo-generated electrons can be used to photo reduction, therefore the photocatalytic activity of BiVO 4 is enhanced. Raman spectroscopy can provide structural information and is also a sensitive method for the investigation of the crystallization, local structure, and electronic properties of materials.The Raman spectra of RGO and BiVO 4 /RGO40 nanocomposites were excited using a red (718 nm) laser, the corresponding spectra are shown in Fig. 6. Raman bands of around 120, 210, 324, 366 and 826 cm -1 are the typical vibrational bands of BiVO 4 28,34,35.For RGO, the ratio of the D band (1350 cm A1 ), originating from disorderactivated Raman mode, to the G band (1596 cm A1 ), corresponding to sp 2 hybridized carbon, is usually used to semiquantitatively determine the extent of reduction 36.Compared with pure RGO, lower D/G ratios (2.44 vs. 0.92) are obtained for BiVO 4 /RGO4 nano composites, indicating that RGO was deeply reduced during the hydrothermal process with the assistance of BiVO 4 .The I D /I G value of BiVO 4 /RGO40 nanocomposites are less than RGO, showing that the RGO in nanocomposites has few defects. The electrochemical impedance technique was employed to characterize electrical conductivity.The EIS measurements were carried out on a CHI660E workstation by using three-electrode cells.The resultant electrode served as the working electrode with a platinum wire as the counter electrode and a saturated calomel electrode as the reference electrodes, which was performed in the presence of a 10 mM K 3 Fe(CN) 6 /K 4 Fe(CN) 6 (1:1) mixture as a redox probe in 0.5 M KCl solution.The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements were recorded with an AC voltage amplitude of 10 mV and a frequency range of 10 MHz to 10 kHz.Fig. 7 compares the Nyquist plots of reference BiVO 4 and BiVO 4 / RGO40 electrodes.It is observed that, with the introduction of RGO, though in small amount, the semicircle in the plot become smaller, which indicate the reduction of the solid state interface layer resistance and the charge transfer resistance on the surface.The resistances of BiVO 4 and BiVO 4 /RGO40 nanocomposites are 58 X and 7 X respectively.This is because of graphene being a zero bandgap semiconductor with a unique structure, in which the charge carriers behave as massless fermions, leading to unique transport properties.Thus, in BiVO 4 /RGO40, RGO serves as an acceptor of the generated electrons of BiVO 4 and effectively suppresses the charge recombination, leaving more charge carriers to form reactive species and promote the reduction reaction. The photo-reduction effects for Cr (VI) and carbon dioxide were used to compare the photo-catalytic reactivity of BiVO 4 /RGO and BiVO 4 under simulated solar light. The reduction curves of Cr (VI) are shown in Fig. 8.It can be seen that the decomposition of Cr (VI) is negligible under simulated solar light without any catalyst (around 3 during 150 min exposure).The photo-catalytic reduction efficiency of BiVO 4 /RGO nanocomposites is higher than that of pure BiVO 4 .With the increases of RGO content in BiVO 4 /RGO from 20 to 60, the photo-catalytic activity increases firstly and then decreases.The results suggest that the ratio of 40 is the optimum ratio.An approximate 84.7 of the Cr (VI) was removed from the solution after 150 min radiation in the presence of BiVO 4 /RGO40 nanocomposites.For comparison, the pure BiVO 4 particles were also checked, that only about 34.6 of Cr (VI) was decomposed under the same testing condition.The photo-reduction efficiency of BiVO 4 /RGO40 nanocomposites increases about 50.1.It is fully demonstrated that BiVO 4 /RGO nanocomposites have much higher photo-catalytic activity than bare BiVO 4 under simulated solar light.In the meantime, the BiVO 4 /RGO nanocomposites also present higher dye adsorption capacity than BiVO 4 particles under the dark condition before the irradiation due to their higher specific surface area.All the above observation indicates that the introduction of RGO plays an active part in the adsorption and catalytic reduction reaction of Cr (VI).RGO can act as an electron acceptor allowing for the photo-excited electrons of semiconductor in the composites to be quickly transferred from the conduction band of semiconductor to RGO, and RGO can also provide more sites for photo-reduction. In the photo-catalytic reduction reaction, carbon dioxide reacts with suspension in the presence of photo-catalyst and light to form a variety of products such as methane, methanol, and some higher hydrocarbons 37.In this experiment, ethanol as the target product is used to test the catalytic capability of BiVO 4 /RGO40 for the photo-reduction of CO 2 .Fig. 9 shows that ethanol yields variations with the increases of irradiation time.What's more, it is demonstrated that BiVO 4 /RGO40 nanocomposites have much higher photo-catalytic activity than pure BiVO 4. The ethanol yield improves about 15.4 lmol/g-cat.The results clearly indicate that the photo-catalytic performance of BiVO 4 can be greatly improved after incorporating RGO sheets. The efficient adsorption of pollutant on the photo-catalysts and effective separation of photo-generated electron/hole pairs are the most important factors, which determine the efficiency of the photo-catalytic reaction.A series of free radical reactions can be initiated by photo-generated electrons and valence band holes which are formed by the excited BiVO 4 /RGO40 composites.In the process of catalytic reaction, valence electrons of BiVO 4 are excited to the conduction band under simulated sunlight irradiation.And then the photo-generated electrons are transferred to the RGO, which acts as electron receptor.Therefore, the surface of BiVO 4 / RGO40 is main place of reaction.At the same time, the hole reacts with H 2 O producing O 2 and H , therefore the electron-hole recombination rate decreases and photo-catalytic performance can be greatly improved.Last, the electron and H react with Cr 2 O 7 2A to Cr 3 and water.The generation of Cr 3 can be proved by XPS (Fig. A.2).The main reactions can be expressed as in the following: 3.10.The mechanism analysis of Photo-reduction CO 2 Some basic processes and major steps of the photo-reduction of the CO 2 aqueous solution have been proposed 38,39.However, the detailed mechanism has not been fully understood.According to our study, first three steps are same as the mechanism of photo-reduction Cr (VI).And then, the excited electron reacts with H and forms A H radical. Last, the electron and A H radical react with CO 2 to create CH 3 CH 2 OH during photo-catalytic reduction of carbon dioxide.The main reactions can be expressed as in the following:"}, {"llm generation": "Liquid", "source": "The mechanism analysis of Photo-reduction CO 2 Some basic processes and major steps of the photo-reduction of the CO 2 aqueous solution have been proposed 38,39.", "context": "The morphologies and microstructures of the graphite oxide, RGO, BiVO 4 and BiVO 4 /RGO40 samples were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM).Fig. 1a andb show the typical TEM image of graphite oxide and RGO respectively.The result shows that RGO is smoother than graphite oxide.Fig. 1c shows a typical TEM image of BiVO 4 nanoparticles.The BiVO 4 particles are irregularly rod like structure with the length-diameter ratio of 2.5-3.0.The average length of particle is around 70-150 nm.In Fig. 1d, for the TEM image of composites, the graphene is decorated by butterfly-like BiVO 4 lamella which distributes randomly on the surface.The surface of graphite oxide contains a small amount of ACOOH, which affects the nucleation and growth of bismuth vanadate leading the morphology of bismuth vanadate being changed.Furthermore, it can be seen that there is no apparent aggregation of BiVO 4 particles on the surface of RGO.It is deduced that such combination not only alleviates the agglomeration of BiVO 4 nanoparticles but also restrains the restacking of RGO and weakens the loss of high active surface area 16, moreover, the presence of RGO seems in favor of particle' growth.In the same reaction conditions, Fig. 1b andd show that RGO layer is thinner than composites.

The reduction curves of Cr (VI) are shown in Fig. 8.It can be seen that the decomposition of Cr (VI) is negligible under simulated solar light without any catalyst (around 3 during 150 min exposure).The photo-catalytic reduction efficiency of BiVO 4 /RGO nanocomposites is higher than that of pure BiVO 4 .With the increases of RGO content in BiVO 4 /RGO from 20 to 60, the photo-catalytic activity increases firstly and then decreases.The results suggest that the ratio of 40 is the optimum ratio.An approximate 84.7 of the Cr (VI) was removed from the solution after 150 min radiation in the presence of BiVO 4 /RGO40 nanocomposites.For comparison, the pure BiVO 4 particles were also checked, that only about 34.6 of Cr (VI) was decomposed under the same testing condition.The photo-reduction efficiency of BiVO 4 /RGO40 nanocomposites increases about 50.1.It is fully demonstrated that BiVO 4 /RGO nanocomposites have much higher photo-catalytic activity than bare BiVO 4 under simulated solar light.In the meantime, the BiVO 4 /RGO nanocomposites also present higher dye adsorption capacity than BiVO 4 particles under the dark condition before the irradiation due to their higher specific surface area.All the above observation indicates that the introduction of RGO plays an active part in the adsorption and catalytic reduction reaction of Cr (VI).RGO can act as an electron acceptor allowing for the photo-excited electrons of semiconductor in the composites to be quickly transferred from the conduction band of semiconductor to RGO, and RGO can also provide more sites for photo-reduction. In the photo-catalytic reduction reaction, carbon dioxide reacts with suspension in the presence of photo-catalyst and light to form a variety of products such as methane, methanol, and some higher hydrocarbons 37.In this experiment, ethanol as the target product is used to test the catalytic capability of BiVO 4 /RGO40 for the photo-reduction of CO 2 .Fig. 9 shows that ethanol yields variations with the increases of irradiation time.What's more, it is demonstrated that BiVO 4 /RGO40 nanocomposites have much higher photo-catalytic activity than pure BiVO 4. The ethanol yield improves about 15.4 lmol/g-cat.The results clearly indicate that the photo-catalytic performance of BiVO 4 can be greatly improved after incorporating RGO sheets. The efficient adsorption of pollutant on the photo-catalysts and effective separation of photo-generated electron/hole pairs are the most important factors, which determine the efficiency of the photo-catalytic reaction.A series of free radical reactions can be initiated by photo-generated electrons and valence band holes which are formed by the excited BiVO 4 /RGO40 composites.In the process of catalytic reaction, valence electrons of BiVO 4 are excited to the conduction band under simulated sunlight irradiation.And then the photo-generated electrons are transferred to the RGO, which acts as electron receptor.Therefore, the surface of BiVO 4 / RGO40 is main place of reaction.At the same time, the hole reacts with H 2 O producing O 2 and H , therefore the electron-hole recombination rate decreases and photo-catalytic performance can be greatly improved.Last, the electron and H react with Cr 2 O 7 2A to Cr 3 and water.The generation of Cr 3 can be proved by XPS (Fig. A.2).The main reactions can be expressed as in the following: 3.10.The mechanism analysis of Photo-reduction CO 2 Some basic processes and major steps of the photo-reduction of the CO 2 aqueous solution have been proposed 38,39.However, the detailed mechanism has not been fully understood.According to our study, first three steps are same as the mechanism of photo-reduction Cr (VI).And then, the excited electron reacts with H and forms A H radical. Last, the electron and A H radical react with CO 2 to create CH 3 CH 2 OH during photo-catalytic reduction of carbon dioxide.The main reactions can be expressed as in the following:"}], "reactor type": [], "operation mode": [{"llm generation": "Batch", "source": "An approximate 84.7 of the Cr (VI) was removed from the solution after 150 min radiation in the presence of BiVO 4 /RGO40 nanocomposites.", "context": "The morphologies and microstructures of the graphite oxide, RGO, BiVO 4 and BiVO 4 /RGO40 samples were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM).Fig. 1a andb show the typical TEM image of graphite oxide and RGO respectively.The result shows that RGO is smoother than graphite oxide.Fig. 1c shows a typical TEM image of BiVO 4 nanoparticles.The BiVO 4 particles are irregularly rod like structure with the length-diameter ratio of 2.5-3.0.The average length of particle is around 70-150 nm.In Fig. 1d, for the TEM image of composites, the graphene is decorated by butterfly-like BiVO 4 lamella which distributes randomly on the surface.The surface of graphite oxide contains a small amount of ACOOH, which affects the nucleation and growth of bismuth vanadate leading the morphology of bismuth vanadate being changed.Furthermore, it can be seen that there is no apparent aggregation of BiVO 4 particles on the surface of RGO.It is deduced that such combination not only alleviates the agglomeration of BiVO 4 nanoparticles but also restrains the restacking of RGO and weakens the loss of high active surface area 16, moreover, the presence of RGO seems in favor of particle' growth.In the same reaction conditions, Fig. 1b andd show that RGO layer is thinner than composites. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns are used to further study the changes in structure.Fig. 2 shows the XRD results of pure BiVO 4 particles and BiVO 4 /RGO40 composites.It can be seen that almost all the diffraction peaks can be assigned to monoclinic BiVO 4 (JCPDS 14-0688) 7,28.Three peaks centered at 19.0, 35.2, and 46.0belonging to the monoclinic scheelite structure's iconic twin peaks of BiVO 4 29 can be clearly observed in the patterns of the BiVO 4 particles and BiVO 4 /RGO40 composites.What's more, BiVO 4 particles' peaks are all the same as the BiVO 4 /RGO40 composites.No peak of RGO is observed in composites.This is due to graphene oxide sheets are reduced to RGO under the hydrothermal conditions in the presence of alcohols, which usually appear no XRD peak 30.On the other hand, the peak of RGO might be hided by the peaks of Bi particles.The VO 3 (A) is transferred to VO 4 (A) and graphite oxide to RGO during hydrothermal process without extra reluctant and reduction step, verifying the hydrothermal method is high efficient, simple and green in the composites preparation. UV-Vis absorption spectra are an informative and important technique to determine the change in the absorption of the semiconductor photo-catalysts.The optical properties of BiVO 4 nano-particles and BiVO 4 /RGO nanocomposites were investigated by the UV-Vis spectroscopy, as shown in Fig. 3.According to the spectra, the pure BiVO 4 nanoparticles have strong absorption in the UV region and a broad adsorption band from 250 to 480 nm.However, there is an enhanced absorbance in the visible light region for the BiVO 4 /RGO nanocomposites.The band gap energies (E g ) of pure BiVO 4 and BiVO 4 /RGO composites can be estimated from the wavelength values corresponding to the intersection point of the vertical and horizontal parts of the spectra using the following equation: E g hc/k, where E g is the band gap energy (eV), h is the Planck's constant, c is the light velocity (m/s), and k is the wavelength (nm).The band gap energies of BiVO 4 , BiVO 4 /RGO 20, BiVO 4 /RGO 30, BiVO 4 / RGO 40 and BiVO 4 /RGO60 are 2.43 eV, 2.30 eV, 2.10 eV, 1.99 and 2.05 eV respectively, shown in Table 1.Therefore, the best proportion of BiVO 4 and GO is 40.The same result can also be found in photo-reduction of Cr (VI) in Fig. 8. Therefore, the above results indicate that the BiVO 4 /RGO nanocomposites can be excited to produce much more electron-hole pairs than BiVO 4 under simulated solar light, which has higher photo-catalytic activity. FT-IR spectrum is an informative and important technique to determine the change of the functional group of material.FT-IR spectra of graphite oxide, RGO, BiVO 4 and BiVO 4 /RGO40 are shown in Fig. 4. The graphite oxide spectrum shows the presence of various oxygen-containing groups.The peaks at 1701 cm A1 , 1219 cm A1 and 1049 cm A1 are assigned to CO, CAO, and COC vibrations, respectively.The peak at 1621 cm A1 is due to the skeletal vibration of un-oxidized graphitic domains or the remaining sp 2 carbon character of graphite 31.In comparison with the graphite oxide, the absorption peaks of OH group (3404 cm A1 ) and epoxide group (1390 cm A1 ) become weak, the absorption peaks of CAO, and CO oriented from COOH groups at 1072 cm A1 and 1720 cm A1 are absent in the IR spectrum of RGO.These results indicate that the graphite oxide has been reduced to a great extent (theoretical model predicted that the complete reduction may be difficult 32).In comparison with BiVO 4 /RGO40, pure BiVO 4 and RGO, it is showed that the BiVO 4 /RGO40 composites are made up of RGO and BiVO 4 particles. Fluorescence spectra have been widely used to investigate the efficiency of charge carrier trapping, immigration and transfer, and to reflect the fate of photo-generated electron-hole pairs from semiconductor particles under light illumination 33.Fig. 5 shows the fluorescence spectra of BiVO 4 and BiVO 4 /RGO40 nanocomposites.The fluorescence emission is excited by the recombination of electrons-hole, the weak intensity of fluorescence shows that the recombination rate of electronic-hole is lower.The fluorescence spectrum intensity of BiVO 4 sample is higher than BiVO 4 /RGO40 nanocomposites, indicating that the electron-hole pair's recombination rate for BiVO 4 /RGO40 composites is lower and more photo-generated electrons can be used to photo reduction, therefore the photocatalytic activity of BiVO 4 is enhanced. Raman spectroscopy can provide structural information and is also a sensitive method for the investigation of the crystallization, local structure, and electronic properties of materials.The Raman spectra of RGO and BiVO 4 /RGO40 nanocomposites were excited using a red (718 nm) laser, the corresponding spectra are shown in Fig. 6. Raman bands of around 120, 210, 324, 366 and 826 cm -1 are the typical vibrational bands of BiVO 4 28,34,35.For RGO, the ratio of the D band (1350 cm A1 ), originating from disorderactivated Raman mode, to the G band (1596 cm A1 ), corresponding to sp 2 hybridized carbon, is usually used to semiquantitatively determine the extent of reduction 36.Compared with pure RGO, lower D/G ratios (2.44 vs. 0.92) are obtained for BiVO 4 /RGO4 nano composites, indicating that RGO was deeply reduced during the hydrothermal process with the assistance of BiVO 4 .The I D /I G value of BiVO 4 /RGO40 nanocomposites are less than RGO, showing that the RGO in nanocomposites has few defects. The electrochemical impedance technique was employed to characterize electrical conductivity.The EIS measurements were carried out on a CHI660E workstation by using three-electrode cells.The resultant electrode served as the working electrode with a platinum wire as the counter electrode and a saturated calomel electrode as the reference electrodes, which was performed in the presence of a 10 mM K 3 Fe(CN) 6 /K 4 Fe(CN) 6 (1:1) mixture as a redox probe in 0.5 M KCl solution.The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements were recorded with an AC voltage amplitude of 10 mV and a frequency range of 10 MHz to 10 kHz.Fig. 7 compares the Nyquist plots of reference BiVO 4 and BiVO 4 / RGO40 electrodes.It is observed that, with the introduction of RGO, though in small amount, the semicircle in the plot become smaller, which indicate the reduction of the solid state interface layer resistance and the charge transfer resistance on the surface.The resistances of BiVO 4 and BiVO 4 /RGO40 nanocomposites are 58 X and 7 X respectively.This is because of graphene being a zero bandgap semiconductor with a unique structure, in which the charge carriers behave as massless fermions, leading to unique transport properties.Thus, in BiVO 4 /RGO40, RGO serves as an acceptor of the generated electrons of BiVO 4 and effectively suppresses the charge recombination, leaving more charge carriers to form reactive species and promote the reduction reaction.
