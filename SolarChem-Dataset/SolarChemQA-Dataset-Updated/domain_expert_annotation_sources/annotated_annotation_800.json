For fabricating Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 , MIL-110 (Al) was firstly synthesized hydrothermally in the presence of trimethyl 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate (Me 3 btc) 21.MIL-110 (Al) is one of the metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) which are promising templates for forming catalysts via calcinations 222324.The porous structures of the catalysts prepared by using MOFs as the templates are similar to those of the MOF templates.This is benefit for achieving a high dispersion of the metal nanoparticles, even at a high metal content.The preparation of MIL-110 (Al) proceeded through the following steps.In the first step, 1.426 g of Al (NO 3 ) 3 9H 2 O (Tianjin Kermel Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd, AR, 99.0) was dissolved into 22 ml of deionized (DI) water.In the second step, 0.478 g of Me 3 btc was added into the solution obtained in the first step under vigorous stirring.In the third step, 2.2 ml of NaOH (4 M) was introduced to form a white emulsion, followed by adding HNO 3 (4 M) to adjust the pH value to about 3.9.After stirring for another 30 min, the mixture obtained in the third step was transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless steel at 200 C for 3 h.The sample obtained from the hydrothermal process was washed with DI water and further purified by dimethyl formamide (DMF, Tianjin Kermel Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd, AR, 99.5).The product was thoroughly washed with ethanol for several times to remove DMF and filtered, and dried at 80 C for 12 h, leading to the formation of the yellowish powdered MIL-110 (Al).Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Data shows the XRD and SEM results of MIL-110 (Al).The MIL-110 (Al) exhibits a rod-like morphology and a XRD pattern characteristic of MOF. Incipient wetness impregnation was used to load nickel precursor into MIL-110 (Al).Typically, 3.78 g of Ni(NO 3 ) 2 6H 2 O (Sinopharm chemical Reagent Co. Ltd., AR, 98.0) was dissolved in a DMF solution.5 g of MIL-110 (Al) was then impregnated with the Ni-contained DMF solution for 12 h.As-obtained sample was dried at 120 C for 12 h. The Ni-impregnated MIL-110 (Al) was next sulfured in a fixed-bed tubular reactor.In the first step of the sulfuration, the temperature of the reactor was increased to 350 C in N 2 with a flowing rate of 20 ml min -1 .And then, the N 2 was stopped, and H 2 containing dimethyl sulfide (CH 3 SCH 3 ) as the sulfur source was introduced into the reactor (15 ml min -1 ).A syringe pump was used to inject the CH 3 SCH 3 liquid into the H 2 stream (0.5 ml min -1 ).The sulfuration proceeded for 6 h. After sulfuration of 6 h, the temperature of the reactor was decreased to room temperature in N 2 (20 ml min -1 ), producing Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .For comparison, we also prepared Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 by using the thiophene, carbon disulfide and dimethyl disulfide as the sulfur sources through the process same as that by using the dimethyl sulfide. For comparison, NiO/Al 2 O 3 was prepared by calcining the Ni-impregnated MIL-110 (Al) in air at 400 C for 3 h, and Ni/Al 2 O 3 was fabricated by the same procedure as the sulfuration but only with hydrogen for reduction and without the addition of sulfide species. Loading of CdS nanoparticles on Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 , denoted as CdS/ Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 , was proceeded in 200 ml of aqueous solution containing 10 vol triethanoamine (TEOA) as the sacrificial reagent.Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 (160 mg) and CdS nanoparticles (40 mg) were added into the solution under ultrasonication for 2 h.The mixture was then divided into two parts.One part (100 mL) was centrifuged to collect the solid sample which was washed with ethanol and DI water for several times and subsequently dried in a vacuum freeze drier for further characterization.The other part (100 mL) was used for the visible-light-driven photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O. For preparing CdS/Pt, the CdS nanoparticles (20 mg) were dispersed in 1 ml of water solution of H 2 PtCl 6 6H 2 O, with a Pt content of 2.0 mg mL -1 , under ultrasonication for 30 min, depositing Pt ions onto the CdS nanoparticles.And then, the sample was irradiated for 1 h by using a 300 W Xe-lamp, reducing Pt ions into Pt 0 .Finally, the solid sample was harvested by centrifugation, washed with ethanol and DI water for several times, and dried under vacuum at 25 C for 12 h, fabricating CdS/Pt. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on an X' Pert Pro diffractometer equipped with Cu K radiation (scanning rate: 4m in -1 ).An ASAP 2020 analyzer (Micromeritics, Norcross, GA, USA) was used to explore the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas.UV-vis spectra were obtained on a UV-3101 Shimadzu spectrophotometer.The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out on an ESCALAB250Xi X-ray photoelectron spectrometer with a monochromatic X-ray source manufactured by Thermo.The binding energy was calibrated using the C 1 s peak (284.6 eV).Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations, including high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) and elemental mapping, were performed on a Philips TECNAI G 2 F30 system (beam energy: 200 kV).The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) measurements were conducted on a Bruker Tensor-27 spectrometer (resolution: 4 cm -1 ).A Fluoromax-3 spectrometer (Horiba Scientific) was used to collect the photoluminescence (PL) spectra.The inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) measurements were conducted on a Thermo X series 2 ICP-MS spectrometer.A Bruker EMXplus-10/12 spectrometer was applied for obtaining the electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra, with a microwave frequency of 9.64 GHz and a modulation amplitude of 2 G. 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO, 98.0;Sigma Chemical Co.) was used as the spin-trap reagent for the hydroxyl radicals. Transient photocurrents were measured on a CHI660 A electrochemical workstation in a Na 2 SO 4 solution (0.1 M) containing TEOA (10 vol ), by using a 300 W Xe-lamp equipped with a cut-off filter ( 420 nm), with a constant potential of 0.35 V vs. standard electrode (SCE).The solution and light source used for measuring the photocurrent are similar to those for the photocatalytic reactions.The workstation includes three electrodes.The working electrode, with a surface area of 1.44 cm 2 exposed to the electrolyte, was prepared by placing the sample on indium tin oxide (ITO) glasses.Pt and a saturated calomel electrode were used as the counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively.For preparing the working electrode, with a surface area of 1.44 cm 2 exposed to the electrolyte, 1 mg sample was firstly dispersed in 1 ml ethanol containing naphthol (0.05 wt) under ultrasonication.Then, the suspension was dropped onto ITO glasses, and dried at room temperature.The CO 2 adsorption capacities of the samples were examined on an ASAP 2020 analyzer (Micromeritics, Norcross, GA, USA), with pressures ranging from 0 to 1.01 bar, at 25 C.Before the adsorption experiments, the samples were degassed at 200 C for 12 h. The photoreduction was performed in a closed gas circulation-evacuation reactor, with H 2 O as the reductant, under the irradiation of visible light ( 420 nm).Before reaction, the following three steps were carried out.Firstly, 100 mg photocatalyst was dispersed in a H 2 O solution (100 mL) containing TEOA (10 vol) which serve as sacrificial reagents for capturing the photogenerated holes, in the reactor.And then, the reactor was evacuated and refilled with pure CO 2 gas for three times to remove the air inside.Finally, the reactor was filled with CO 2 until the pressure of the reactor reaching to the atmospheric pressure (101.325kPa).In the photocatalytic reduction, the reactor was irradiated with a Xe-lamp (300 W) equipped with a cut-off filter ( 420 nm) under stirring, and the temperature of the reactor was kept at 25 C by using cooling water.The products were detected by a gas chromatography (Agilent 7890 A) with both with Flame Ionization (FID) and Thermal Conductivity (TCD) detectors.The FID detector and an Agilent HPPLOT Q capillary column were used for analyzing methanol, while the TCD detector and a Porapak Q packed column were used for analyzing H 2 , O 2 , CO 2 , CO and CH 4 .Ar was used as the carrier gas.The GC was switched between the two columns by using a fourport valve.To determine the source of the carbon in the products, an isotopic experiment was carried out under the identical reaction conditions using 13 CO 2 (99.99 in purity), and the products were analyzed by a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Fig. 1a shows the XRD pattern of Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .On the XRD pattern, all of the peaks are attributed to the orthorhombic Ni 9 S 8 (PDF .There is no XRD peak assigned to Al 2 O 3 for Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 , indicating that the Al 2 O 3 support is amorphous.Fig. 1b andc 25,26.The XPS peak of S can be fitted into peaks at 161.3, 162.0, 162.7, 163.6, 166.3 and 168.2 eV, respectively (Fig. S2b).The peaks at 161.3 and 166.3 eV are assigned to the 2p 1/2 of S in Ni 9 S 8 , and the peaks at 162.0, 162.7 and 163.6 eV are due to the 2p 3/2 of S in Ni 9 S 8 252627.The peak at 168.2 eV is caused by the S in the SeO bonds 282930 S3) were fabricated via the hot-injection method which has been reported in detail elsewhere 313233.On the XRD pattern of CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 (Fig. 1a), besides the peaks of the orthorhombic Ni 9 S 8 , a peak at 26.5assigned to the (111) plane of the cubic CdS also appears (PDF80-0019). The performance of CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 and control samples in the visible-light-driven photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O were next explored by using the aqueous solution containing TEOA (10 vol) as a hole scavenger.The results are plotted in Fig. 3 and Fig. S5 in the Supplementary Data.During the experiments, CO is the main the product.In addition to CO, there is some methanol detected during the photocatalytic reactions, but the evolution rate of the methanol is lower than 0.1 mol h -1 .As reflected in Figs.3a andS5 Supplementary Data), an optimum CO evolution rate of 10. 13 CO 2 as the reactant was also done for determining the source of the carbon in CO.The m/z at 29 on the GC-MS spectrum is caused by 13 CO (Fig. S9 in the Supplementary Data), further revealing that CO is from the visible-light-driven photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .An evident peak at 490 nm, which is assigned to the recombination of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs, appears on the PL spectrum of CdS.This is in good agreement with the PL results reported previously for CdS 31323334.On CdS/Ni 9 S 8 and CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 , the PL peak at 490 nm is quenched significantly, implying an efficient electron-hole separation.The photocurrents of CdS, CdS/Ni 9 S 8 and CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 are illustrated in Fig. 4b.The photocurrent on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 is 0.42 mA cm -2 , which is much higher than those on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 (0.33 mA cm -2 ) and CdS (0.02 mA cm -2 ).Thus, on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 , the electron-hole recombination is efficiently suppressed, and more photogenerated electrons are transferred into the measuring circuit during the photocurrent experiments.The PL and photocurrent results indicate that the Al 2 O 3 support triggers more efficient electron-hole separation during the photocatalytic reaction.As reported previously, in photocatalysis, highly conductive supports, such as reduced graphene oxide and carbon nanotubes, can efficiently promote the separation of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs 18,353637.Our present results suggest that the Al 2 O 3 support, which has a poor conductivity, is also excellent in separating the photogenerated electronhole pairs.This could be originated from the defects and the hydroxyl groups on the Al 2 O 3 support.).The oxygen vacancies could also make some contributions to the enhanced CO 2 adsorption on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 39.As such, the Al 2 O 3 support triggers an improved CO 2 adsorption on the photocatalyst.Fig. 5b illustrates the dependence of the adsorption heat on the amount of CO 2 adsorbed, estimated by the Clausius-Clapeyron equation 404142.For all of the samples, the adsorption heat decreases with increasing CO 2 coverage, and the highest adsorption heat is obtained at the onset of CO 2 adsorption.For CdS, the highest adsorption heat is only 11.2 kJ mol -1 .With increasing the CO 2 adsorption coverage, the adsorption heat on CdS is close to zero.The low adsorption heat indicates that the CO 2 adsorption on CdS may be physical adsorption without any structural change occurring on the linear CO 2 molecule (OeCeO angle: 180) 8.The physical adsorption could be responsible for the low CO 2 adsorption capacity of CdS (Fig. 5a).The adsorption heats of Ni 9 S 8 and CdS/Ni 9 S 8 are similar, with the highest value of about 55.0 kJ mol -1 .The highest adsorption heat of CO 2 on Al 2 O 3 is 65.0 kJ mol -1 , which is in good agreement with the adsorption heat obtained from the density functional theory (DFT) calculations in our previous papers 39,43,44.The highest adsorption heat of CO 2 on -species, with a bent structure in which the OeCeO angle is about 140 39,43,44.The bands at 1230 and 1420 cm -1 are caused by the bidentate and monodentate carbonate species (CO 3 2-), respectively 8,39,43,44.The bands at 1535 and 1640 cm -1 are due to the bicarbonate species (HCO 3 -) formed from the protonation reaction between the carbonate species and the hydroxyl groups on the photocatalyst 8,39,43,44.On the FTIR spectrum of Ni 9 S 8 , the bands due to the CO 6b.With the wavelength increasing from 420 to 520 nm, the QE of CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 becomes higher firstly, and then decreases, with the highest QE (20.4) presents at 460 nm.The photocatalytic stability of CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 was examined in four consecutive runs with each run of 4 h, and there is nothing to do but evacuate the reactor between two runs.As shown in Fig. 6c, CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 has a good stability in hydrogen production.There is almost no decrease of the total amount of the hydrogen produced after four runs on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .These results show that the Al 2 O 3 support triggers an enhanced hydrogen production (proton production) from the visible-light-driven photocatalytic H 2 O splitting. PL, photocurrent, CO 2 adsorption and hydrogen production experiments suggest that, in the visible-light-driven photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O, the Al 2 O 3 support triggers enhanced separation of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs, CO 2 adsorption and production of hydrogen (or proton) for reducing CO 2 .This will definitely increase the amount of the electrons, CO 2 and hydrogen (or proton) participating in the photoreduction of CO 2 , thus leading to the enhanced CO evolution from the photoreduction of CO 2 on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 . Reactions possibly occurring during the visible-light-driven photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O to form CO on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 are listed as Eqs.( 1)-(9) (Eqs.( 1)-( 9)).Light absorption by CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 leads to the formation of the electron-hole pairs (Eq.( 1)).Capture of the photogenerated holes by the TEOA produces TEOA (Eq.( 2)).H 2 O can be split into an H atom and an OH -in the presence of the photogenerated electrons (Eq.( 3)).Reaction of OH -with TEOA results in an OH group and a TEOA molecule (Eq.( 4)).Reaction of CO 2 with the proton and photogenerated electron (Eq.( 5)), or/and with the H atom (Eq.( 6)), produces CO and an OH group.ESR experiments were conducted for studying the formation of the hydroxyl radicals by using DMPO as the radical probe.The evident DMPO-OH signals indicate the presence of the OH radicals (Fig. S11 in the Supplementary Data) 48.The protons (or H atoms) can combine together to form H 2 (Eqs.( 7) and ( 8)), and the OH groups can be converted into O 2 and H 2 O (Eqs.( 9)).During the conversion of CO 2 into CO through reactions 5 and 6, carbon and bicarbonate species could be the key intermediates.We analyzed the influence of the photoreduction on the photocatalyst by conducting XRD measurement.As shown in Fig. 1a, the XRD pattern of the photocatalyst after the photoreduction of 16 h is similar to that of the photocatalyst before the photoreduction.This indicates that there is almost no change on the properties of the photocatalyst. The Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalyst has been widely used in industry 495051.Sulfur poisoning, which can convert nickel into nickel sulfide, is one of the most serious problems negatively affecting the activity, selectivity and stability of the Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalyst 495051.Generally, the sulfurpoisoned Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalyst is discarded or regenerated through complex processes.Our present work indicates that the sulfur-poisoned Ni/ Al 2 O 3 catalyst could be excellent cocatalysts for the photoreduction of CO 2 .This opens a new way for the application of the sulfur-poisoned Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalyst. In conclusion, a highly efficient CO evolution, with an evolution rate of 12.1 mol h -1 , is achieved from the photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O on a noble-metal-free CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 photocatalyst, under the irradiation of visible light ( 420 nm) which is the main part of sunlight.The CO evolution rate on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 is comparable to that on the noble-metal-based CdS/Pt/Al 2 O 3 photocatalyst (10.6 mol h -1 ), but 11 times higher than that on the Al 2 O 3 -free CdS/ Ni 9 S 8 (1.1 mol h -1 ) photocatalyst.The Al 2 O 3 support triggers improved separation of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs, CO 2 adsorption and production of protons for reducing CO 2 .This is responsible for the enhanced CO evolution on the CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .These results are helpful for fabricating low-cost noble-metal-free photocatalysts for more efficient photoreduction of CO 2 . Fig.1ashows the XRD pattern of Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .On the XRD pattern, all of the peaks are attributed to the orthorhombic Ni 9 S 8 (PDF22- 1193).There is no XRD peak assigned to Al 2 O 3 for Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 , indicating that the Al 2 O 3 support is amorphous.Fig.1b and cillustrate the N 2 absorption-desorption curves and pore size distribution for Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .From the N 2 absorption-desorption experiment, the BET surface area of Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 is calculated to be 143 m 2 g -1 .The XPS spectra of the Ni and S on Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 are shown in Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Data.Six peaks at 853.1, 856.2, 861.4,870.3, 873.8 and 880.2 eV, respectively, are present on the XPS spectrum of Ni (Fig.S2a).The peaks at 853.1, 856.2 and 870.3 eV are attributed to the 2p 3/2 , 2p 3/2 and 2p 1/2 of Ni in Ni 9 S 8 , respectively252627.The peaks at 861.4, 873.8 and 880.2 eV are caused by the Ni in Ni-O bonds25,26.The XPS peak of S can be fitted into peaks at 161.3, 162.0, 162.7, 163.6, 166.3 and 168.2 eV, respectively (Fig.S2b).The peaks at 161.3 and 166.3 eV are assigned to the 2p 1/2 of S in Ni 9 S 8 , and the peaks at 162.0, 162.7 and 163.6 eV are due to the 2p 3/2 of S in Ni 9 S 8252627.The peak at 168.2 eV is caused by the S in the SeO bonds282930.The XPS results indicate that, besides the Ni-S bonds in Ni 9 S 8 , there are also Ni-O and SeO bonds on Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .The Ni-O and SeO bonds could be formed through the bonding interactions of the Ni and S atoms in Ni 9 S 8 with the O atoms on the Al 2 O 3 support, and could be the main drive to anchor Ni 9 S 8 on the Al 2 O 3 support.Fig. 2a and b illustrate the TEM images of Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .The Ni 9 S 8 nanoparticles are dispersed on the Al 2 O 3 support.The lattice fringes with distances of 0.183 and 0.237 nm are due to the (115) and (330) planes of the orthorhombic Ni 9 S 8 , respectively, indicating the presence of the orthorhombic Ni 9 S 8 on Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .This is in good agreement with the XRD and XPS results. CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 CdS nanoparticles with an average size of about 5 nm (Fig. S3 in the Supplementary Data) were next loaded on Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 to form the CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 photocatalyst.The CdS nanoparticles in the cubic phase of CdS (Fig. Fig. 2c-e show the HRTEM image and elemental mapping patterns for CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .The lattice fringe Fig. 1.(a) XRD patterns for Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 , CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 before reaction and CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 after reaction.(b) N 2 adsorption-desorption curves and (c) pore size distributions for Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 and CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .

Reaction conditions: 100 ml water solution containing 10 vol TEOA, 100 mg photocatalyst, 300 W Xe-lamp ( 420 nm). Roles of CdS, Ni 9 S 8 and Al 2 O 3 in the photoreduction During the photoreduction of CO 2 , the CdS nanoparticles are responsible for the absorption of the visible light, as indicated by the UV-vis spectra (Fig. S4).The Ni 9 S 8 nanoparticles play as the cocatalysts providing the active sites for the photocatalytic reactions, as reflected by the low CO evolution on CdS/Al 2 O 3 (Fig. 3a) as well as the comparable CO evolution on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 to that on CdS/Pt/Al 2 O 3 .The much higher CO evolution on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 than that on CdS/ Ni 9 S 8 suggests that the Al 2 O 3 support plays an important role in the visible-light-driven photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O.For investigating the role of the Al 2 O 3 support, we studied the ability of the photocatalysts in separating the photogenerated electron-hole pairs, adsorbing CO 2 and producing protons from H 2 O splitting, which are the key factors affecting the photoreduction efficiency of CO 2 .Fig. 4a plots the PL spectra of CdS, CdS/Ni 9 S 8 and CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 . Fig. 5a plots the CO 2 adsorption capacity of CdS, Ni 9 S 8 , Al 2 O 3 , CdS/ Ni 9 S 8 , Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 and CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .The CO 2 adsorption capacity of CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 is 1.53 mmol g -1 , which is higher than those of CdS (0.12 mmol g -1 ), Ni 9 S 8 (0.49 mmol g -1 ) and Al 2 O 3 (1.15mmol g -1 ).The CO 2 adsorption capacity of CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 is about 2.5 and 1.1 times higher than those on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 (0.62 mmol g -1 ) and Ni 9 S 8 / Al 2 O 3 (1.40 mmol g -1 ), respectively.The interface and synergetic effect among different components may enhance the CO 2 adsorption on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .We have explored the O 1 s XPS spectrum of Ni 9 S 8 / Al 2 O 3 , as shown in Fig. S10 in the Supplementary Data.The XPS peaks at 530.9, 531.8, and 532.7 eV are attributed to the O 2-ion in the Al 2 O 3 structure (O a ), oxygen vacancies (O b ) and near-surface oxygen (O c ), respectively 38.The ratio of O b to the total oxygen species is 44 based on the calculation of O b /(O a O b O c Fig. 4.

(ii) Ex. with CO 2 , H 2 O and light, but without CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 ; (iii) Ex. with CdS/ Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 , light and H 2 O, but without CO 2 .No CO is generated in all of the Ex., implying that CO is from the visible-light-driven photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .Besides, an isotopic experiment with 454647minate, whereas on the FTIR spectra of Al 2 O 3 and CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 , the main bands are those assigned to the carbonate and bicarbonate species.As such, the presence of the Al 2 O 3 support triggers the formation of the carbonate and bicarbonate species from CO 2 adsorption.Previous DFT calculations demonstrated that, on the Al 2 O 3 -supported catalysts, the carbonate species are formed upon CO 2 adsorption, and then converted into bicarbonate species through protonation process in which the protons of the hydroxyl groups on the Al 2 O 3 support are transferred to one of the oxygen atoms of the carbonate species8,39,43,44.The carbonate and bicarbonate species have been shown to be the key intermediates for CO 2 conversion454647.Therefore, the formation of the carbonate and bicarbonate species resulted from the presence of the Al 2 O 3 support could be one of the reasons for the enhanced CO evolution on CdS/ Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 as compared with CdS/Ni 9 S 8 without the Al 2 O 3 support.Fig. 6 shows the activity of the photocatalysts for producing hydrogen in the visible-light-driven photocatalytic H 2 O splitting.There is no hydrogen evolution from Al 2 O 3 , CdS/Ni/Al 2 O 3 , Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 and CdS/NiO/Al 2 O 3 .Hydrogen was detected on CdS and CdS/Al 2 O 3 , but the evolution rates are only 3.6 and 5.4 mol h -1 , respectively.On CdS/Ni 9 S 8 , the hydrogen production is enhanced, with an evolution rate of 30.8 mol h -1 .As compared with CdS/Ni 9 S 8 , the hydrogen evolution rate on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 increases further, with a value of 84.1 mol h -1 .The quantum efficiency (QE) of CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 in hydrogen production is shown in Fig. (5)/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 hv h e -(1)h TEOA TEOA (2)H 2 O e - H OH -(3)OH - TEOA TEOA OH (4)CO 2 H e - CO OH(5) Acknowledgements This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos.21503062, U1662138, 21878203, and 21406153), Shanxi International Cooperation Project (No. 201703D421037), Shanxi Province Science Foundation for Youths (No. 201601D202019), Shanxi Provincial Key Innovative Research Team in Science and Technology (No. 2014131006), Scientific and Technological Innovation Programs of Higher Education Institutions in Shanxi (No. 2017137), and Program for the Outstanding Innovative Teams of Higher Learning Institutions of Shanxi (154010146-s).

For fabricating Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 , MIL-110 (Al) was firstly synthesized hydrothermally in the presence of trimethyl 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate (Me 3 btc) 21.MIL-110 (Al) is one of the metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) which are promising templates for forming catalysts via calcinations 222324.The porous structures of the catalysts prepared by using MOFs as the templates are similar to those of the MOF templates.This is benefit for achieving a high dispersion of the metal nanoparticles, even at a high metal content.The preparation of MIL-110 (Al) proceeded through the following steps.In the first step, 1.426 g of Al (NO 3 ) 3 9H 2 O (Tianjin Kermel Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd, AR, 99.0) was dissolved into 22 ml of deionized (DI) water.In the second step, 0.478 g of Me 3 btc was added into the solution obtained in the first step under vigorous stirring.In the third step, 2.2 ml of NaOH (4 M) was introduced to form a white emulsion, followed by adding HNO 3 (4 M) to adjust the pH value to about 3.9.After stirring for another 30 min, the mixture obtained in the third step was transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless steel at 200 C for 3 h.The sample obtained from the hydrothermal process was washed with DI water and further purified by dimethyl formamide (DMF, Tianjin Kermel Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd, AR, 99.5).The product was thoroughly washed with ethanol for several times to remove DMF and filtered, and dried at 80 C for 12 h, leading to the formation of the yellowish powdered MIL-110 (Al).Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Data shows the XRD and SEM results of MIL-110 (Al).The MIL-110 (Al) exhibits a rod-like morphology and a XRD pattern characteristic of MOF. Incipient wetness impregnation was used to load nickel precursor into MIL-110 (Al).Typically, 3.78 g of Ni(NO 3 ) 2 6H 2 O (Sinopharm chemical Reagent Co. Ltd., AR, 98.0) was dissolved in a DMF solution.5 g of MIL-110 (Al) was then impregnated with the Ni-contained DMF solution for 12 h.As-obtained sample was dried at 120 C for 12 h. The Ni-impregnated MIL-110 (Al) was next sulfured in a fixed-bed tubular reactor.In the first step of the sulfuration, the temperature of the reactor was increased to 350 C in N 2 with a flowing rate of 20 ml min -1 .And then, the N 2 was stopped, and H 2 containing dimethyl sulfide (CH 3 SCH 3 ) as the sulfur source was introduced into the reactor (15 ml min -1 ).A syringe pump was used to inject the CH 3 SCH 3 liquid into the H 2 stream (0.5 ml min -1 ).The sulfuration proceeded for 6 h. After sulfuration of 6 h, the temperature of the reactor was decreased to room temperature in N 2 (20 ml min -1 ), producing Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .For comparison, we also prepared Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 by using the thiophene, carbon disulfide and dimethyl disulfide as the sulfur sources through the process same as that by using the dimethyl sulfide. For comparison, NiO/Al 2 O 3 was prepared by calcining the Ni-impregnated MIL-110 (Al) in air at 400 C for 3 h, and Ni/Al 2 O 3 was fabricated by the same procedure as the sulfuration but only with hydrogen for reduction and without the addition of sulfide species. Loading of CdS nanoparticles on Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 , denoted as CdS/ Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 , was proceeded in 200 ml of aqueous solution containing 10 vol triethanoamine (TEOA) as the sacrificial reagent.Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 (160 mg) and CdS nanoparticles (40 mg) were added into the solution under ultrasonication for 2 h.The mixture was then divided into two parts.One part (100 mL) was centrifuged to collect the solid sample which was washed with ethanol and DI water for several times and subsequently dried in a vacuum freeze drier for further characterization.The other part (100 mL) was used for the visible-light-driven photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O. For preparing CdS/Pt, the CdS nanoparticles (20 mg) were dispersed in 1 ml of water solution of H 2 PtCl 6 6H 2 O, with a Pt content of 2.0 mg mL -1 , under ultrasonication for 30 min, depositing Pt ions onto the CdS nanoparticles.And then, the sample was irradiated for 1 h by using a 300 W Xe-lamp, reducing Pt ions into Pt 0 .Finally, the solid sample was harvested by centrifugation, washed with ethanol and DI water for several times, and dried under vacuum at 25 C for 12 h, fabricating CdS/Pt. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on an X' Pert Pro diffractometer equipped with Cu K radiation (scanning rate: 4m in -1 ).An ASAP 2020 analyzer (Micromeritics, Norcross, GA, USA) was used to explore the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas.UV-vis spectra were obtained on a UV-3101 Shimadzu spectrophotometer.The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out on an ESCALAB250Xi X-ray photoelectron spectrometer with a monochromatic X-ray source manufactured by Thermo.The binding energy was calibrated using the C 1 s peak (284.6 eV).Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations, including high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) and elemental mapping, were performed on a Philips TECNAI G 2 F30 system (beam energy: 200 kV).The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) measurements were conducted on a Bruker Tensor-27 spectrometer (resolution: 4 cm -1 ).A Fluoromax-3 spectrometer (Horiba Scientific) was used to collect the photoluminescence (PL) spectra.The inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) measurements were conducted on a Thermo X series 2 ICP-MS spectrometer.A Bruker EMXplus-10/12 spectrometer was applied for obtaining the electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra, with a microwave frequency of 9.64 GHz and a modulation amplitude of 2 G. 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO, 98.0;Sigma Chemical Co.) was used as the spin-trap reagent for the hydroxyl radicals. Transient photocurrents were measured on a CHI660 A electrochemical workstation in a Na 2 SO 4 solution (0.1 M) containing TEOA (10 vol ), by using a 300 W Xe-lamp equipped with a cut-off filter ( 420 nm), with a constant potential of 0.35 V vs. standard electrode (SCE).The solution and light source used for measuring the photocurrent are similar to those for the photocatalytic reactions.The workstation includes three electrodes.The working electrode, with a surface area of 1.44 cm 2 exposed to the electrolyte, was prepared by placing the sample on indium tin oxide (ITO) glasses.Pt and a saturated calomel electrode were used as the counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively.For preparing the working electrode, with a surface area of 1.44 cm 2 exposed to the electrolyte, 1 mg sample was firstly dispersed in 1 ml ethanol containing naphthol (0.05 wt) under ultrasonication.Then, the suspension was dropped onto ITO glasses, and dried at room temperature.The CO 2 adsorption capacities of the samples were examined on an ASAP 2020 analyzer (Micromeritics, Norcross, GA, USA), with pressures ranging from 0 to 1.01 bar, at 25 C.Before the adsorption experiments, the samples were degassed at 200 C for 12 h. The photoreduction was performed in a closed gas circulation-evacuation reactor, with H 2 O as the reductant, under the irradiation of visible light ( 420 nm).Before reaction, the following three steps were carried out.Firstly, 100 mg photocatalyst was dispersed in a H 2 O solution (100 mL) containing TEOA (10 vol) which serve as sacrificial reagents for capturing the photogenerated holes, in the reactor.And then, the reactor was evacuated and refilled with pure CO 2 gas for three times to remove the air inside.Finally, the reactor was filled with CO 2 until the pressure of the reactor reaching to the atmospheric pressure (101.325kPa).In the photocatalytic reduction, the reactor was irradiated with a Xe-lamp (300 W) equipped with a cut-off filter ( 420 nm) under stirring, and the temperature of the reactor was kept at 25 C by using cooling water.The products were detected by a gas chromatography (Agilent 7890 A) with both with Flame Ionization (FID) and Thermal Conductivity (TCD) detectors.The FID detector and an Agilent HPPLOT Q capillary column were used for analyzing methanol, while the TCD detector and a Porapak Q packed column were used for analyzing H 2 , O 2 , CO 2 , CO and CH 4 .Ar was used as the carrier gas.The GC was switched between the two columns by using a fourport valve.To determine the source of the carbon in the products, an isotopic experiment was carried out under the identical reaction conditions using 13 CO 2 (99.99 in purity), and the products were analyzed by a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Fig. 1a shows the XRD pattern of Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .On the XRD pattern, all of the peaks are attributed to the orthorhombic Ni 9 S 8 (PDF .There is no XRD peak assigned to Al 2 O 3 for Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 , indicating that the Al 2 O 3 support is amorphous.Fig. 1b andc 25,26.The XPS peak of S can be fitted into peaks at 161.3, 162.0, 162.7, 163.6, 166.3 and 168.2 eV, respectively (Fig. S2b).The peaks at 161.3 and 166.3 eV are assigned to the 2p 1/2 of S in Ni 9 S 8 , and the peaks at 162.0, 162.7 and 163.6 eV are due to the 2p 3/2 of S in Ni 9 S 8 252627.The peak at 168.2 eV is caused by the S in the SeO bonds 282930 S3) were fabricated via the hot-injection method which has been reported in detail elsewhere 313233.On the XRD pattern of CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 (Fig. 1a), besides the peaks of the orthorhombic Ni 9 S 8 , a peak at 26.5assigned to the (111) plane of the cubic CdS also appears (PDF80-0019). The performance of CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 and control samples in the visible-light-driven photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O were next explored by using the aqueous solution containing TEOA (10 vol) as a hole scavenger.The results are plotted in Fig. 3 and Fig. S5 in the Supplementary Data.During the experiments, CO is the main the product.In addition to CO, there is some methanol detected during the photocatalytic reactions, but the evolution rate of the methanol is lower than 0.1 mol h -1 .As reflected in Figs.3a andS5 Supplementary Data), an optimum CO evolution rate of 10. 13 CO 2 as the reactant was also done for determining the source of the carbon in CO.The m/z at 29 on the GC-MS spectrum is caused by 13 CO (Fig. S9 in the Supplementary Data), further revealing that CO is from the visible-light-driven photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .An evident peak at 490 nm, which is assigned to the recombination of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs, appears on the PL spectrum of CdS.This is in good agreement with the PL results reported previously for CdS 31323334.On CdS/Ni 9 S 8 and CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 , the PL peak at 490 nm is quenched significantly, implying an efficient electron-hole separation.The photocurrents of CdS, CdS/Ni 9 S 8 and CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 are illustrated in Fig. 4b.The photocurrent on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 is 0.42 mA cm -2 , which is much higher than those on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 (0.33 mA cm -2 ) and CdS (0.02 mA cm -2 ).Thus, on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 , the electron-hole recombination is efficiently suppressed, and more photogenerated electrons are transferred into the measuring circuit during the photocurrent experiments.The PL and photocurrent results indicate that the Al 2 O 3 support triggers more efficient electron-hole separation during the photocatalytic reaction.As reported previously, in photocatalysis, highly conductive supports, such as reduced graphene oxide and carbon nanotubes, can efficiently promote the separation of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs 18,353637.Our present results suggest that the Al 2 O 3 support, which has a poor conductivity, is also excellent in separating the photogenerated electronhole pairs.This could be originated from the defects and the hydroxyl groups on the Al 2 O 3 support.).The oxygen vacancies could also make some contributions to the enhanced CO 2 adsorption on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 39.As such, the Al 2 O 3 support triggers an improved CO 2 adsorption on the photocatalyst.Fig. 5b illustrates the dependence of the adsorption heat on the amount of CO 2 adsorbed, estimated by the Clausius-Clapeyron equation 404142.For all of the samples, the adsorption heat decreases with increasing CO 2 coverage, and the highest adsorption heat is obtained at the onset of CO 2 adsorption.For CdS, the highest adsorption heat is only 11.2 kJ mol -1 .With increasing the CO 2 adsorption coverage, the adsorption heat on CdS is close to zero.The low adsorption heat indicates that the CO 2 adsorption on CdS may be physical adsorption without any structural change occurring on the linear CO 2 molecule (OeCeO angle: 180) 8.The physical adsorption could be responsible for the low CO 2 adsorption capacity of CdS (Fig. 5a).The adsorption heats of Ni 9 S 8 and CdS/Ni 9 S 8 are similar, with the highest value of about 55.0 kJ mol -1 .The highest adsorption heat of CO 2 on Al 2 O 3 is 65.0 kJ mol -1 , which is in good agreement with the adsorption heat obtained from the density functional theory (DFT) calculations in our previous papers 39,43,44.The highest adsorption heat of CO 2 on -species, with a bent structure in which the OeCeO angle is about 140 39,43,44.The bands at 1230 and 1420 cm -1 are caused by the bidentate and monodentate carbonate species (CO 3 2-), respectively 8,39,43,44.The bands at 1535 and 1640 cm -1 are due to the bicarbonate species (HCO 3 -) formed from the protonation reaction between the carbonate species and the hydroxyl groups on the photocatalyst 8,39,43,44.On the FTIR spectrum of Ni 9 S 8 , the bands due to the CO 6b.With the wavelength increasing from 420 to 520 nm, the QE of CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 becomes higher firstly, and then decreases, with the highest QE (20.4) presents at 460 nm.The photocatalytic stability of CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 was examined in four consecutive runs with each run of 4 h, and there is nothing to do but evacuate the reactor between two runs.As shown in Fig. 6c, CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 has a good stability in hydrogen production.There is almost no decrease of the total amount of the hydrogen produced after four runs on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .These results show that the Al 2 O 3 support triggers an enhanced hydrogen production (proton production) from the visible-light-driven photocatalytic H 2 O splitting. PL, photocurrent, CO 2 adsorption and hydrogen production experiments suggest that, in the visible-light-driven photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O, the Al 2 O 3 support triggers enhanced separation of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs, CO 2 adsorption and production of hydrogen (or proton) for reducing CO 2 .This will definitely increase the amount of the electrons, CO 2 and hydrogen (or proton) participating in the photoreduction of CO 2 , thus leading to the enhanced CO evolution from the photoreduction of CO 2 on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 . Reactions possibly occurring during the visible-light-driven photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O to form CO on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 are listed as Eqs.( 1)-(9) (Eqs.( 1)-( 9)).Light absorption by CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 leads to the formation of the electron-hole pairs (Eq.( 1)).Capture of the photogenerated holes by the TEOA produces TEOA (Eq.( 2)).H 2 O can be split into an H atom and an OH -in the presence of the photogenerated electrons (Eq.( 3)).Reaction of OH -with TEOA results in an OH group and a TEOA molecule (Eq.( 4)).Reaction of CO 2 with the proton and photogenerated electron (Eq.( 5)), or/and with the H atom (Eq.( 6)), produces CO and an OH group.ESR experiments were conducted for studying the formation of the hydroxyl radicals by using DMPO as the radical probe.The evident DMPO-OH signals indicate the presence of the OH radicals (Fig. S11 in the Supplementary Data) 48.The protons (or H atoms) can combine together to form H 2 (Eqs.( 7) and ( 8)), and the OH groups can be converted into O 2 and H 2 O (Eqs.( 9)).During the conversion of CO 2 into CO through reactions 5 and 6, carbon and bicarbonate species could be the key intermediates.We analyzed the influence of the photoreduction on the photocatalyst by conducting XRD measurement.As shown in Fig. 1a, the XRD pattern of the photocatalyst after the photoreduction of 16 h is similar to that of the photocatalyst before the photoreduction.This indicates that there is almost no change on the properties of the photocatalyst. The Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalyst has been widely used in industry 495051.Sulfur poisoning, which can convert nickel into nickel sulfide, is one of the most serious problems negatively affecting the activity, selectivity and stability of the Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalyst 495051.Generally, the sulfurpoisoned Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalyst is discarded or regenerated through complex processes.Our present work indicates that the sulfur-poisoned Ni/ Al 2 O 3 catalyst could be excellent cocatalysts for the photoreduction of CO 2 .This opens a new way for the application of the sulfur-poisoned Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalyst. In conclusion, a highly efficient CO evolution, with an evolution rate of 12.1 mol h -1 , is achieved from the photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O on a noble-metal-free CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 photocatalyst, under the irradiation of visible light ( 420 nm) which is the main part of sunlight.The CO evolution rate on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 is comparable to that on the noble-metal-based CdS/Pt/Al 2 O 3 photocatalyst (10.6 mol h -1 ), but 11 times higher than that on the Al 2 O 3 -free CdS/ Ni 9 S 8 (1.1 mol h -1 ) photocatalyst.The Al 2 O 3 support triggers improved separation of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs, CO 2 adsorption and production of protons for reducing CO 2 .This is responsible for the enhanced CO evolution on the CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .These results are helpful for fabricating low-cost noble-metal-free photocatalysts for more efficient photoreduction of CO 2 . Fig.1ashows the XRD pattern of Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .On the XRD pattern, all of the peaks are attributed to the orthorhombic Ni 9 S 8 (PDF22- 1193).There is no XRD peak assigned to Al 2 O 3 for Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 , indicating that the Al 2 O 3 support is amorphous.Fig.1b and cillustrate the N 2 absorption-desorption curves and pore size distribution for Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .From the N 2 absorption-desorption experiment, the BET surface area of Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 is calculated to be 143 m 2 g -1 .The XPS spectra of the Ni and S on Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 are shown in Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Data.Six peaks at 853.1, 856.2, 861.4,870.3, 873.8 and 880.2 eV, respectively, are present on the XPS spectrum of Ni (Fig.S2a).The peaks at 853.1, 856.2 and 870.3 eV are attributed to the 2p 3/2 , 2p 3/2 and 2p 1/2 of Ni in Ni 9 S 8 , respectively252627.The peaks at 861.4, 873.8 and 880.2 eV are caused by the Ni in Ni-O bonds25,26.The XPS peak of S can be fitted into peaks at 161.3, 162.0, 162.7, 163.6, 166.3 and 168.2 eV, respectively (Fig.S2b).The peaks at 161.3 and 166.3 eV are assigned to the 2p 1/2 of S in Ni 9 S 8 , and the peaks at 162.0, 162.7 and 163.6 eV are due to the 2p 3/2 of S in Ni 9 S 8252627.The peak at 168.2 eV is caused by the S in the SeO bonds282930.The XPS results indicate that, besides the Ni-S bonds in Ni 9 S 8 , there are also Ni-O and SeO bonds on Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .The Ni-O and SeO bonds could be formed through the bonding interactions of the Ni and S atoms in Ni 9 S 8 with the O atoms on the Al 2 O 3 support, and could be the main drive to anchor Ni 9 S 8 on the Al 2 O 3 support.Fig. 2a and b illustrate the TEM images of Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .The Ni 9 S 8 nanoparticles are dispersed on the Al 2 O 3 support.The lattice fringes with distances of 0.183 and 0.237 nm are due to the (115) and (330) planes of the orthorhombic Ni 9 S 8 , respectively, indicating the presence of the orthorhombic Ni 9 S 8 on Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .This is in good agreement with the XRD and XPS results. CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 CdS nanoparticles with an average size of about 5 nm (Fig. S3 in the Supplementary Data) were next loaded on Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 to form the CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 photocatalyst.The CdS nanoparticles in the cubic phase of CdS (Fig. Fig. 2c-e show the HRTEM image and elemental mapping patterns for CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .The lattice fringe Fig. 1.(a) XRD patterns for Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 , CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 before reaction and CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 after reaction.(b) N 2 adsorption-desorption curves and (c) pore size distributions for Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 and CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .

Reaction conditions: 100 ml water solution containing 10 vol TEOA, 100 mg photocatalyst, 300 W Xe-lamp ( 420 nm). Roles of CdS, Ni 9 S 8 and Al 2 O 3 in the photoreduction During the photoreduction of CO 2 , the CdS nanoparticles are responsible for the absorption of the visible light, as indicated by the UV-vis spectra (Fig. S4).The Ni 9 S 8 nanoparticles play as the cocatalysts providing the active sites for the photocatalytic reactions, as reflected by the low CO evolution on CdS/Al 2 O 3 (Fig. 3a) as well as the comparable CO evolution on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 to that on CdS/Pt/Al 2 O 3 .The much higher CO evolution on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 than that on CdS/ Ni 9 S 8 suggests that the Al 2 O 3 support plays an important role in the visible-light-driven photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O.For investigating the role of the Al 2 O 3 support, we studied the ability of the photocatalysts in separating the photogenerated electron-hole pairs, adsorbing CO 2 and producing protons from H 2 O splitting, which are the key factors affecting the photoreduction efficiency of CO 2 .Fig. 4a plots the PL spectra of CdS, CdS/Ni 9 S 8 and CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 . Fig. 5a plots the CO 2 adsorption capacity of CdS, Ni 9 S 8 , Al 2 O 3 , CdS/ Ni 9 S 8 , Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 and CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .The CO 2 adsorption capacity of CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 is 1.53 mmol g -1 , which is higher than those of CdS (0.12 mmol g -1 ), Ni 9 S 8 (0.49 mmol g -1 ) and Al 2 O 3 (1.15mmol g -1 ).The CO 2 adsorption capacity of CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 is about 2.5 and 1.1 times higher than those on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 (0.62 mmol g -1 ) and Ni 9 S 8 / Al 2 O 3 (1.40 mmol g -1 ), respectively.The interface and synergetic effect among different components may enhance the CO 2 adsorption on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .We have explored the O 1 s XPS spectrum of Ni 9 S 8 / Al 2 O 3 , as shown in Fig. S10 in the Supplementary Data.The XPS peaks at 530.9, 531.8, and 532.7 eV are attributed to the O 2-ion in the Al 2 O 3 structure (O a ), oxygen vacancies (O b ) and near-surface oxygen (O c ), respectively 38.The ratio of O b to the total oxygen species is 44 based on the calculation of O b /(O a O b O c Fig. 4.

(ii) Ex. with CO 2 , H 2 O and light, but without CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 ; (iii) Ex. with CdS/ Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 , light and H 2 O, but without CO 2 .No CO is generated in all of the Ex., implying that CO is from the visible-light-driven photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .Besides, an isotopic experiment with 454647minate, whereas on the FTIR spectra of Al 2 O 3 and CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 , the main bands are those assigned to the carbonate and bicarbonate species.As such, the presence of the Al 2 O 3 support triggers the formation of the carbonate and bicarbonate species from CO 2 adsorption.Previous DFT calculations demonstrated that, on the Al 2 O 3 -supported catalysts, the carbonate species are formed upon CO 2 adsorption, and then converted into bicarbonate species through protonation process in which the protons of the hydroxyl groups on the Al 2 O 3 support are transferred to one of the oxygen atoms of the carbonate species8,39,43,44.The carbonate and bicarbonate species have been shown to be the key intermediates for CO 2 conversion454647.Therefore, the formation of the carbonate and bicarbonate species resulted from the presence of the Al 2 O 3 support could be one of the reasons for the enhanced CO evolution on CdS/ Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 as compared with CdS/Ni 9 S 8 without the Al 2 O 3 support.Fig. 6 shows the activity of the photocatalysts for producing hydrogen in the visible-light-driven photocatalytic H 2 O splitting.There is no hydrogen evolution from Al 2 O 3 , CdS/Ni/Al 2 O 3 , Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 and CdS/NiO/Al 2 O 3 .Hydrogen was detected on CdS and CdS/Al 2 O 3 , but the evolution rates are only 3.6 and 5.4 mol h -1 , respectively.On CdS/Ni 9 S 8 , the hydrogen production is enhanced, with an evolution rate of 30.8 mol h -1 .As compared with CdS/Ni 9 S 8 , the hydrogen evolution rate on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 increases further, with a value of 84.1 mol h -1 .The quantum efficiency (QE) of CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 in hydrogen production is shown in Fig. (5)/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 hv h e -(1)h TEOA TEOA (2)H 2 O e - H OH -(3)OH - TEOA TEOA OH (4)CO 2 H e - CO OH(5) Acknowledgements This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos.21503062, U1662138, 21878203, and 21406153), Shanxi International Cooperation Project (No. 201703D421037), Shanxi Province Science Foundation for Youths (No. 201601D202019), Shanxi Provincial Key Innovative Research Team in Science and Technology (No. 2014131006), Scientific and Technological Innovation Programs of Higher Education Institutions in Shanxi (No. 2017137), and Program for the Outstanding Innovative Teams of Higher Learning Institutions of Shanxi (154010146-s).

The performance of CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 and control samples in the visible-light-driven photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O were next explored by using the aqueous solution containing TEOA (10 vol) as a hole scavenger.The results are plotted in Fig. 3 and Fig. S5 in the Supplementary Data.During the experiments, CO is the main the product.In addition to CO, there is some methanol detected during the photocatalytic reactions, but the evolution rate of the methanol is lower than 0.1 mol h -1 .As reflected in Figs.3a andS5 Supplementary Data), an optimum CO evolution rate of 10. 13 CO 2 as the reactant was also done for determining the source of the carbon in CO.The m/z at 29 on the GC-MS spectrum is caused by 13 CO (Fig. S9 in the Supplementary Data), further revealing that CO is from the visible-light-driven photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .An evident peak at 490 nm, which is assigned to the recombination of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs, appears on the PL spectrum of CdS.This is in good agreement with the PL results reported previously for CdS 31323334.On CdS/Ni 9 S 8 and CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 , the PL peak at 490 nm is quenched significantly, implying an efficient electron-hole separation.The photocurrents of CdS, CdS/Ni 9 S 8 and CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 are illustrated in Fig. 4b.The photocurrent on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 is 0.42 mA cm -2 , which is much higher than those on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 (0.33 mA cm -2 ) and CdS (0.02 mA cm -2 ).Thus, on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 , the electron-hole recombination is efficiently suppressed, and more photogenerated electrons are transferred into the measuring circuit during the photocurrent experiments.The PL and photocurrent results indicate that the Al 2 O 3 support triggers more efficient electron-hole separation during the photocatalytic reaction.As reported previously, in photocatalysis, highly conductive supports, such as reduced graphene oxide and carbon nanotubes, can efficiently promote the separation of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs 18,353637.Our present results suggest that the Al 2 O 3 support, which has a poor conductivity, is also excellent in separating the photogenerated electronhole pairs.This could be originated from the defects and the hydroxyl groups on the Al 2 O 3 support.).The oxygen vacancies could also make some contributions to the enhanced CO 2 adsorption on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 39.As such, the Al 2 O 3 support triggers an improved CO 2 adsorption on the photocatalyst.Fig. 5b illustrates the dependence of the adsorption heat on the amount of CO 2 adsorbed, estimated by the Clausius-Clapeyron equation 404142.For all of the samples, the adsorption heat decreases with increasing CO 2 coverage, and the highest adsorption heat is obtained at the onset of CO 2 adsorption.For CdS, the highest adsorption heat is only 11.2 kJ mol -1 .With increasing the CO 2 adsorption coverage, the adsorption heat on CdS is close to zero.The low adsorption heat indicates that the CO 2 adsorption on CdS may be physical adsorption without any structural change occurring on the linear CO 2 molecule (OeCeO angle: 180) 8.The physical adsorption could be responsible for the low CO 2 adsorption capacity of CdS (Fig. 5a).The adsorption heats of Ni 9 S 8 and CdS/Ni 9 S 8 are similar, with the highest value of about 55.0 kJ mol -1 .The highest adsorption heat of CO 2 on Al 2 O 3 is 65.0 kJ mol -1 , which is in good agreement with the adsorption heat obtained from the density functional theory (DFT) calculations in our previous papers 39,43,44.The highest adsorption heat of CO 2 on -species, with a bent structure in which the OeCeO angle is about 140 39,43,44.The bands at 1230 and 1420 cm -1 are caused by the bidentate and monodentate carbonate species (CO 3 2-), respectively 8,39,43,44.The bands at 1535 and 1640 cm -1 are due to the bicarbonate species (HCO 3 -) formed from the protonation reaction between the carbonate species and the hydroxyl groups on the photocatalyst 8,39,43,44.On the FTIR spectrum of Ni 9 S 8 , the bands due to the CO 6b.With the wavelength increasing from 420 to 520 nm, the QE of CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 becomes higher firstly, and then decreases, with the highest QE (20.4) presents at 460 nm.The photocatalytic stability of CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 was examined in four consecutive runs with each run of 4 h, and there is nothing to do but evacuate the reactor between two runs.As shown in Fig. 6c, CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 has a good stability in hydrogen production.There is almost no decrease of the total amount of the hydrogen produced after four runs on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .These results show that the Al 2 O 3 support triggers an enhanced hydrogen production (proton production) from the visible-light-driven photocatalytic H 2 O splitting. PL, photocurrent, CO 2 adsorption and hydrogen production experiments suggest that, in the visible-light-driven photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O, the Al 2 O 3 support triggers enhanced separation of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs, CO 2 adsorption and production of hydrogen (or proton) for reducing CO 2 .This will definitely increase the amount of the electrons, CO 2 and hydrogen (or proton) participating in the photoreduction of CO 2 , thus leading to the enhanced CO evolution from the photoreduction of CO 2 on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 . Reactions possibly occurring during the visible-light-driven photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O to form CO on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 are listed as Eqs.( 1)-(9) (Eqs.( 1)-( 9)).Light absorption by CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 leads to the formation of the electron-hole pairs (Eq.( 1)).Capture of the photogenerated holes by the TEOA produces TEOA (Eq.( 2)).H 2 O can be split into an H atom and an OH -in the presence of the photogenerated electrons (Eq.( 3)).Reaction of OH -with TEOA results in an OH group and a TEOA molecule (Eq.( 4)).Reaction of CO 2 with the proton and photogenerated electron (Eq.( 5)), or/and with the H atom (Eq.( 6)), produces CO and an OH group.ESR experiments were conducted for studying the formation of the hydroxyl radicals by using DMPO as the radical probe.The evident DMPO-OH signals indicate the presence of the OH radicals (Fig. S11 in the Supplementary Data) 48.The protons (or H atoms) can combine together to form H 2 (Eqs.( 7) and ( 8)), and the OH groups can be converted into O 2 and H 2 O (Eqs.( 9)).During the conversion of CO 2 into CO through reactions 5 and 6, carbon and bicarbonate species could be the key intermediates.We analyzed the influence of the photoreduction on the photocatalyst by conducting XRD measurement.As shown in Fig. 1a, the XRD pattern of the photocatalyst after the photoreduction of 16 h is similar to that of the photocatalyst before the photoreduction.This indicates that there is almost no change on the properties of the photocatalyst. The Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalyst has been widely used in industry 495051.Sulfur poisoning, which can convert nickel into nickel sulfide, is one of the most serious problems negatively affecting the activity, selectivity and stability of the Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalyst 495051.Generally, the sulfurpoisoned Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalyst is discarded or regenerated through complex processes.Our present work indicates that the sulfur-poisoned Ni/ Al 2 O 3 catalyst could be excellent cocatalysts for the photoreduction of CO 2 .This opens a new way for the application of the sulfur-poisoned Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalyst."}, {"llm generation": "CdS/Ni9S8/Al2O3 photocatalyst", "source": "In conclusion, a highly efficient CO evolution, with an evolution rate of 12.1 mol h -1 , is achieved from the photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O on a noble-metal-free CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 photocatalyst, under the irradiation of visible light ( 420 nm) which is the main part of sunlight.", "context": "In conclusion, a highly efficient CO evolution, with an evolution rate of 12.1 mol h -1 , is achieved from the photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O on a noble-metal-free CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 photocatalyst, under the irradiation of visible light ( 420 nm) which is the main part of sunlight.The CO evolution rate on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 is comparable to that on the noble-metal-based CdS/Pt/Al 2 O 3 photocatalyst (10.6 mol h -1 ), but 11 times higher than that on the Al 2 O 3 -free CdS/ Ni 9 S 8 (1.1 mol h -1 ) photocatalyst.The Al 2 O 3 support triggers improved separation of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs, CO 2 adsorption and production of protons for reducing CO 2 .This is responsible for the enhanced CO evolution on the CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .These results are helpful for fabricating low-cost noble-metal-free photocatalysts for more efficient photoreduction of CO 2 . Fig.1ashows the XRD pattern of Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .On the XRD pattern, all of the peaks are attributed to the orthorhombic Ni 9 S 8 (PDF22- 1193).There is no XRD peak assigned to Al 2 O 3 for Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 , indicating that the Al 2 O 3 support is amorphous.Fig.1b and cillustrate the N 2 absorption-desorption curves and pore size distribution for Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .From the N 2 absorption-desorption experiment, the BET surface area of Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 is calculated to be 143 m 2 g -1 .The XPS spectra of the Ni and S on Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 are shown in Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Data.Six peaks at 853.1, 856.2, 861.4,870.3, 873.8 and 880.2 eV, respectively, are present on the XPS spectrum of Ni (Fig.S2a).The peaks at 853.1, 856.2 and 870.3 eV are attributed to the 2p 3/2 , 2p 3/2 and 2p 1/2 of Ni in Ni 9 S 8 , respectively252627.The peaks at 861.4, 873.8 and 880.2 eV are caused by the Ni in Ni-O bonds25,26.The XPS peak of S can be fitted into peaks at 161.3, 162.0, 162.7, 163.6, 166.3 and 168.2 eV, respectively (Fig.S2b).The peaks at 161.3 and 166.3 eV are assigned to the 2p 1/2 of S in Ni 9 S 8 , and the peaks at 162.0, 162.7 and 163.6 eV are due to the 2p 3/2 of S in Ni 9 S 8252627.The peak at 168.2 eV is caused by the S in the SeO bonds282930.The XPS results indicate that, besides the Ni-S bonds in Ni 9 S 8 , there are also Ni-O and SeO bonds on Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .The Ni-O and SeO bonds could be formed through the bonding interactions of the Ni and S atoms in Ni 9 S 8 with the O atoms on the Al 2 O 3 support, and could be the main drive to anchor Ni 9 S 8 on the Al 2 O 3 support.Fig. 2a and b illustrate the TEM images of Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .The Ni 9 S 8 nanoparticles are dispersed on the Al 2 O 3 support.The lattice fringes with distances of 0.183 and 0.237 nm are due to the (115) and (330) planes of the orthorhombic Ni 9 S 8 , respectively, indicating the presence of the orthorhombic Ni 9 S 8 on Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .This is in good agreement with the XRD and XPS results.

Roles of CdS, Ni 9 S 8 and Al 2 O 3 in the photoreduction During the photoreduction of CO 2 , the CdS nanoparticles are responsible for the absorption of the visible light, as indicated by the UV-vis spectra (Fig. S4).The Ni 9 S 8 nanoparticles play as the cocatalysts providing the active sites for the photocatalytic reactions, as reflected by the low CO evolution on CdS/Al 2 O 3 (Fig. 3a) as well as the comparable CO evolution on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 to that on CdS/Pt/Al 2 O 3 .The much higher CO evolution on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 than that on CdS/ Ni 9 S 8 suggests that the Al 2 O 3 support plays an important role in the visible-light-driven photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O.For investigating the role of the Al 2 O 3 support, we studied the ability of the photocatalysts in separating the photogenerated electron-hole pairs, adsorbing CO 2 and producing protons from H 2 O splitting, which are the key factors affecting the photoreduction efficiency of CO 2 .Fig. 4a plots the PL spectra of CdS, CdS/Ni 9 S 8 and CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 . Fig. 5a plots the CO 2 adsorption capacity of CdS, Ni 9 S 8 , Al 2 O 3 , CdS/ Ni 9 S 8 , Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 and CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .The CO 2 adsorption capacity of CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 is 1.53 mmol g -1 , which is higher than those of CdS (0.12 mmol g -1 ), Ni 9 S 8 (0.49 mmol g -1 ) and Al 2 O 3 (1.15mmol g -1 ).The CO 2 adsorption capacity of CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 is about 2.5 and 1.1 times higher than those on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 (0.62 mmol g -1 ) and Ni 9 S 8 / Al 2 O 3 (1.40 mmol g -1 ), respectively.The interface and synergetic effect among different components may enhance the CO 2 adsorption on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .We have explored the O 1 s XPS spectrum of Ni 9 S 8 / Al 2 O 3 , as shown in Fig. S10 in the Supplementary Data.The XPS peaks at 530.9, 531.8, and 532.7 eV are attributed to the O 2-ion in the Al 2 O 3 structure (O a ), oxygen vacancies (O b ) and near-surface oxygen (O c ), respectively 38.The ratio of O b to the total oxygen species is 44 based on the calculation of O b /(O a O b O c Fig. 4.

(ii) Ex. with CO 2 , H 2 O and light, but without CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 ; (iii) Ex. with CdS/ Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 , light and H 2 O, but without CO 2 .No CO is generated in all of the Ex., implying that CO is from the visible-light-driven photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .Besides, an isotopic experiment with 454647minate, whereas on the FTIR spectra of Al 2 O 3 and CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 , the main bands are those assigned to the carbonate and bicarbonate species.As such, the presence of the Al 2 O 3 support triggers the formation of the carbonate and bicarbonate species from CO 2 adsorption.Previous DFT calculations demonstrated that, on the Al 2 O 3 -supported catalysts, the carbonate species are formed upon CO 2 adsorption, and then converted into bicarbonate species through protonation process in which the protons of the hydroxyl groups on the Al 2 O 3 support are transferred to one of the oxygen atoms of the carbonate species8,39,43,44.The carbonate and bicarbonate species have been shown to be the key intermediates for CO 2 conversion454647.Therefore, the formation of the carbonate and bicarbonate species resulted from the presence of the Al 2 O 3 support could be one of the reasons for the enhanced CO evolution on CdS/ Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 as compared with CdS/Ni 9 S 8 without the Al 2 O 3 support.Fig. 6 shows the activity of the photocatalysts for producing hydrogen in the visible-light-driven photocatalytic H 2 O splitting.There is no hydrogen evolution from Al 2 O 3 , CdS/Ni/Al 2 O 3 , Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 and CdS/NiO/Al 2 O 3 .Hydrogen was detected on CdS and CdS/Al 2 O 3 , but the evolution rates are only 3.6 and 5.4 mol h -1 , respectively.On CdS/Ni 9 S 8 , the hydrogen production is enhanced, with an evolution rate of 30.8 mol h -1 .As compared with CdS/Ni 9 S 8 , the hydrogen evolution rate on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 increases further, with a value of 84.1 mol h -1 .The quantum efficiency (QE) of CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 in hydrogen production is shown in Fig. (5)/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 hv h e -(1)h TEOA TEOA (2)H 2 O e - H OH -(3)OH - TEOA TEOA OH (4)CO 2 H e - CO OH(5) Acknowledgements This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos.21503062, U1662138, 21878203, and 21406153), Shanxi International Cooperation Project (No. 201703D421037), Shanxi Province Science Foundation for Youths (No. 201601D202019), Shanxi Provincial Key Innovative Research Team in Science and Technology (No. 2014131006), Scientific and Technological Innovation Programs of Higher Education Institutions in Shanxi (No. 2017137), and Program for the Outstanding Innovative Teams of Higher Learning Institutions of Shanxi (154010146-s).

(ii) Ex. with CO 2 , H 2 O and light, but without CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 ; (iii) Ex. with CdS/ Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 , light and H 2 O, but without CO 2 .No CO is generated in all of the Ex., implying that CO is from the visible-light-driven photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .Besides, an isotopic experiment with 454647minate, whereas on the FTIR spectra of Al 2 O 3 and CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 , the main bands are those assigned to the carbonate and bicarbonate species.As such, the presence of the Al 2 O 3 support triggers the formation of the carbonate and bicarbonate species from CO 2 adsorption.Previous DFT calculations demonstrated that, on the Al 2 O 3 -supported catalysts, the carbonate species are formed upon CO 2 adsorption, and then converted into bicarbonate species through protonation process in which the protons of the hydroxyl groups on the Al 2 O 3 support are transferred to one of the oxygen atoms of the carbonate species8,39,43,44.The carbonate and bicarbonate species have been shown to be the key intermediates for CO 2 conversion454647.Therefore, the formation of the carbonate and bicarbonate species resulted from the presence of the Al 2 O 3 support could be one of the reasons for the enhanced CO evolution on CdS/ Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 as compared with CdS/Ni 9 S 8 without the Al 2 O 3 support.Fig. 6 shows the activity of the photocatalysts for producing hydrogen in the visible-light-driven photocatalytic H 2 O splitting.There is no hydrogen evolution from Al 2 O 3 , CdS/Ni/Al 2 O 3 , Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 and CdS/NiO/Al 2 O 3 .Hydrogen was detected on CdS and CdS/Al 2 O 3 , but the evolution rates are only 3.6 and 5.4 mol h -1 , respectively.On CdS/Ni 9 S 8 , the hydrogen production is enhanced, with an evolution rate of 30.8 mol h -1 .As compared with CdS/Ni 9 S 8 , the hydrogen evolution rate on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 increases further, with a value of 84.1 mol h -1 .The quantum efficiency (QE) of CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 in hydrogen production is shown in Fig. (5)/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 hv h e -(1)h TEOA TEOA (2)H 2 O e - H OH -(3)OH - TEOA TEOA OH (4)CO 2 H e - CO OH(5) Acknowledgements This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos.21503062, U1662138, 21878203, and 21406153), Shanxi International Cooperation Project (No. 201703D421037), Shanxi Province Science Foundation for Youths (No. 201601D202019), Shanxi Provincial Key Innovative Research Team in Science and Technology (No. 2014131006), Scientific and Technological Innovation Programs of Higher Education Institutions in Shanxi (No. 2017137), and Program for the Outstanding Innovative Teams of Higher Learning Institutions of Shanxi (154010146-s).

For fabricating Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 , MIL-110 (Al) was firstly synthesized hydrothermally in the presence of trimethyl 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate (Me 3 btc) 21.MIL-110 (Al) is one of the metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) which are promising templates for forming catalysts via calcinations 222324.The porous structures of the catalysts prepared by using MOFs as the templates are similar to those of the MOF templates.This is benefit for achieving a high dispersion of the metal nanoparticles, even at a high metal content.The preparation of MIL-110 (Al) proceeded through the following steps.In the first step, 1.426 g of Al (NO 3 ) 3 9H 2 O (Tianjin Kermel Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd, AR, 99.0) was dissolved into 22 ml of deionized (DI) water.In the second step, 0.478 g of Me 3 btc was added into the solution obtained in the first step under vigorous stirring.In the third step, 2.2 ml of NaOH (4 M) was introduced to form a white emulsion, followed by adding HNO 3 (4 M) to adjust the pH value to about 3.9.After stirring for another 30 min, the mixture obtained in the third step was transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless steel at 200 C for 3 h.The sample obtained from the hydrothermal process was washed with DI water and further purified by dimethyl formamide (DMF, Tianjin Kermel Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd, AR, 99.5).The product was thoroughly washed with ethanol for several times to remove DMF and filtered, and dried at 80 C for 12 h, leading to the formation of the yellowish powdered MIL-110 (Al).Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Data shows the XRD and SEM results of MIL-110 (Al).The MIL-110 (Al) exhibits a rod-like morphology and a XRD pattern characteristic of MOF. Incipient wetness impregnation was used to load nickel precursor into MIL-110 (Al).Typically, 3.78 g of Ni(NO 3 ) 2 6H 2 O (Sinopharm chemical Reagent Co. Ltd., AR, 98.0) was dissolved in a DMF solution.5 g of MIL-110 (Al) was then impregnated with the Ni-contained DMF solution for 12 h.As-obtained sample was dried at 120 C for 12 h. The Ni-impregnated MIL-110 (Al) was next sulfured in a fixed-bed tubular reactor.In the first step of the sulfuration, the temperature of the reactor was increased to 350 C in N 2 with a flowing rate of 20 ml min -1 .And then, the N 2 was stopped, and H 2 containing dimethyl sulfide (CH 3 SCH 3 ) as the sulfur source was introduced into the reactor (15 ml min -1 ).A syringe pump was used to inject the CH 3 SCH 3 liquid into the H 2 stream (0.5 ml min -1 ).The sulfuration proceeded for 6 h. After sulfuration of 6 h, the temperature of the reactor was decreased to room temperature in N 2 (20 ml min -1 ), producing Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .For comparison, we also prepared Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 by using the thiophene, carbon disulfide and dimethyl disulfide as the sulfur sources through the process same as that by using the dimethyl sulfide. For comparison, NiO/Al 2 O 3 was prepared by calcining the Ni-impregnated MIL-110 (Al) in air at 400 C for 3 h, and Ni/Al 2 O 3 was fabricated by the same procedure as the sulfuration but only with hydrogen for reduction and without the addition of sulfide species. Loading of CdS nanoparticles on Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 , denoted as CdS/ Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 , was proceeded in 200 ml of aqueous solution containing 10 vol triethanoamine (TEOA) as the sacrificial reagent.Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 (160 mg) and CdS nanoparticles (40 mg) were added into the solution under ultrasonication for 2 h.The mixture was then divided into two parts.One part (100 mL) was centrifuged to collect the solid sample which was washed with ethanol and DI water for several times and subsequently dried in a vacuum freeze drier for further characterization.The other part (100 mL) was used for the visible-light-driven photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O. For preparing CdS/Pt, the CdS nanoparticles (20 mg) were dispersed in 1 ml of water solution of H 2 PtCl 6 6H 2 O, with a Pt content of 2.0 mg mL -1 , under ultrasonication for 30 min, depositing Pt ions onto the CdS nanoparticles.And then, the sample was irradiated for 1 h by using a 300 W Xe-lamp, reducing Pt ions into Pt 0 .Finally, the solid sample was harvested by centrifugation, washed with ethanol and DI water for several times, and dried under vacuum at 25 C for 12 h, fabricating CdS/Pt. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on an X' Pert Pro diffractometer equipped with Cu K radiation (scanning rate: 4m in -1 ).An ASAP 2020 analyzer (Micromeritics, Norcross, GA, USA) was used to explore the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas.UV-vis spectra were obtained on a UV-3101 Shimadzu spectrophotometer.The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out on an ESCALAB250Xi X-ray photoelectron spectrometer with a monochromatic X-ray source manufactured by Thermo.The binding energy was calibrated using the C 1 s peak (284.6 eV).Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations, including high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) and elemental mapping, were performed on a Philips TECNAI G 2 F30 system (beam energy: 200 kV).The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) measurements were conducted on a Bruker Tensor-27 spectrometer (resolution: 4 cm -1 ).A Fluoromax-3 spectrometer (Horiba Scientific) was used to collect the photoluminescence (PL) spectra.The inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) measurements were conducted on a Thermo X series 2 ICP-MS spectrometer.A Bruker EMXplus-10/12 spectrometer was applied for obtaining the electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra, with a microwave frequency of 9.64 GHz and a modulation amplitude of 2 G. 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO, 98.0;Sigma Chemical Co.) was used as the spin-trap reagent for the hydroxyl radicals. Transient photocurrents were measured on a CHI660 A electrochemical workstation in a Na 2 SO 4 solution (0.1 M) containing TEOA (10 vol ), by using a 300 W Xe-lamp equipped with a cut-off filter ( 420 nm), with a constant potential of 0.35 V vs. standard electrode (SCE).The solution and light source used for measuring the photocurrent are similar to those for the photocatalytic reactions.The workstation includes three electrodes.The working electrode, with a surface area of 1.44 cm 2 exposed to the electrolyte, was prepared by placing the sample on indium tin oxide (ITO) glasses.Pt and a saturated calomel electrode were used as the counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively.For preparing the working electrode, with a surface area of 1.44 cm 2 exposed to the electrolyte, 1 mg sample was firstly dispersed in 1 ml ethanol containing naphthol (0.05 wt) under ultrasonication.Then, the suspension was dropped onto ITO glasses, and dried at room temperature.The CO 2 adsorption capacities of the samples were examined on an ASAP 2020 analyzer (Micromeritics, Norcross, GA, USA), with pressures ranging from 0 to 1.01 bar, at 25 C.Before the adsorption experiments, the samples were degassed at 200 C for 12 h. The photoreduction was performed in a closed gas circulation-evacuation reactor, with H 2 O as the reductant, under the irradiation of visible light ( 420 nm).Before reaction, the following three steps were carried out.Firstly, 100 mg photocatalyst was dispersed in a H 2 O solution (100 mL) containing TEOA (10 vol) which serve as sacrificial reagents for capturing the photogenerated holes, in the reactor.And then, the reactor was evacuated and refilled with pure CO 2 gas for three times to remove the air inside.Finally, the reactor was filled with CO 2 until the pressure of the reactor reaching to the atmospheric pressure (101.325kPa).In the photocatalytic reduction, the reactor was irradiated with a Xe-lamp (300 W) equipped with a cut-off filter ( 420 nm) under stirring, and the temperature of the reactor was kept at 25 C by using cooling water.The products were detected by a gas chromatography (Agilent 7890 A) with both with Flame Ionization (FID) and Thermal Conductivity (TCD) detectors.The FID detector and an Agilent HPPLOT Q capillary column were used for analyzing methanol, while the TCD detector and a Porapak Q packed column were used for analyzing H 2 , O 2 , CO 2 , CO and CH 4 .Ar was used as the carrier gas.The GC was switched between the two columns by using a fourport valve.To determine the source of the carbon in the products, an isotopic experiment was carried out under the identical reaction conditions using 13 CO 2 (99.99 in purity), and the products were analyzed by a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Fig. 1a shows the XRD pattern of Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .On the XRD pattern, all of the peaks are attributed to the orthorhombic Ni 9 S 8 (PDF .There is no XRD peak assigned to Al 2 O 3 for Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 , indicating that the Al 2 O 3 support is amorphous.Fig. 1b andc 25,26.The XPS peak of S can be fitted into peaks at 161.3, 162.0, 162.7, 163.6, 166.3 and 168.2 eV, respectively (Fig. S2b).The peaks at 161.3 and 166.3 eV are assigned to the 2p 1/2 of S in Ni 9 S 8 , and the peaks at 162.0, 162.7 and 163.6 eV are due to the 2p 3/2 of S in Ni 9 S 8 252627.The peak at 168.2 eV is caused by the S in the SeO bonds 282930 S3) were fabricated via the hot-injection method which has been reported in detail elsewhere 313233.On the XRD pattern of CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 (Fig. 1a), besides the peaks of the orthorhombic Ni 9 S 8 , a peak at 26.5assigned to the (111) plane of the cubic CdS also appears (PDF80-0019). The performance of CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 and control samples in the visible-light-driven photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O were next explored by using the aqueous solution containing TEOA (10 vol) as a hole scavenger.The results are plotted in Fig. 3 and Fig. S5 in the Supplementary Data.During the experiments, CO is the main the product.In addition to CO, there is some methanol detected during the photocatalytic reactions, but the evolution rate of the methanol is lower than 0.1 mol h -1 .As reflected in Figs.3a andS5 Supplementary Data), an optimum CO evolution rate of 10. 13 CO 2 as the reactant was also done for determining the source of the carbon in CO.The m/z at 29 on the GC-MS spectrum is caused by 13 CO (Fig. S9 in the Supplementary Data), further revealing that CO is from the visible-light-driven photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .An evident peak at 490 nm, which is assigned to the recombination of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs, appears on the PL spectrum of CdS.This is in good agreement with the PL results reported previously for CdS 31323334.On CdS/Ni 9 S 8 and CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 , the PL peak at 490 nm is quenched significantly, implying an efficient electron-hole separation.The photocurrents of CdS, CdS/Ni 9 S 8 and CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 are illustrated in Fig. 4b.The photocurrent on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 is 0.42 mA cm -2 , which is much higher than those on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 (0.33 mA cm -2 ) and CdS (0.02 mA cm -2 ).Thus, on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 , the electron-hole recombination is efficiently suppressed, and more photogenerated electrons are transferred into the measuring circuit during the photocurrent experiments.The PL and photocurrent results indicate that the Al 2 O 3 support triggers more efficient electron-hole separation during the photocatalytic reaction.As reported previously, in photocatalysis, highly conductive supports, such as reduced graphene oxide and carbon nanotubes, can efficiently promote the separation of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs 18,353637.Our present results suggest that the Al 2 O 3 support, which has a poor conductivity, is also excellent in separating the photogenerated electronhole pairs.This could be originated from the defects and the hydroxyl groups on the Al 2 O 3 support.).The oxygen vacancies could also make some contributions to the enhanced CO 2 adsorption on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 39.As such, the Al 2 O 3 support triggers an improved CO 2 adsorption on the photocatalyst.Fig. 5b illustrates the dependence of the adsorption heat on the amount of CO 2 adsorbed, estimated by the Clausius-Clapeyron equation 404142.For all of the samples, the adsorption heat decreases with increasing CO 2 coverage, and the highest adsorption heat is obtained at the onset of CO 2 adsorption.For CdS, the highest adsorption heat is only 11.2 kJ mol -1 .With increasing the CO 2 adsorption coverage, the adsorption heat on CdS is close to zero.The low adsorption heat indicates that the CO 2 adsorption on CdS may be physical adsorption without any structural change occurring on the linear CO 2 molecule (OeCeO angle: 180) 8.The physical adsorption could be responsible for the low CO 2 adsorption capacity of CdS (Fig. 5a).The adsorption heats of Ni 9 S 8 and CdS/Ni 9 S 8 are similar, with the highest value of about 55.0 kJ mol -1 .The highest adsorption heat of CO 2 on Al 2 O 3 is 65.0 kJ mol -1 , which is in good agreement with the adsorption heat obtained from the density functional theory (DFT) calculations in our previous papers 39,43,44.The highest adsorption heat of CO 2 on -species, with a bent structure in which the OeCeO angle is about 140 39,43,44.The bands at 1230 and 1420 cm -1 are caused by the bidentate and monodentate carbonate species (CO 3 2-), respectively 8,39,43,44.The bands at 1535 and 1640 cm -1 are due to the bicarbonate species (HCO 3 -) formed from the protonation reaction between the carbonate species and the hydroxyl groups on the photocatalyst 8,39,43,44.On the FTIR spectrum of Ni 9 S 8 , the bands due to the CO 6b.With the wavelength increasing from 420 to 520 nm, the QE of CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 becomes higher firstly, and then decreases, with the highest QE (20.4) presents at 460 nm.The photocatalytic stability of CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 was examined in four consecutive runs with each run of 4 h, and there is nothing to do but evacuate the reactor between two runs.As shown in Fig. 6c, CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 has a good stability in hydrogen production.There is almost no decrease of the total amount of the hydrogen produced after four runs on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .These results show that the Al 2 O 3 support triggers an enhanced hydrogen production (proton production) from the visible-light-driven photocatalytic H 2 O splitting. PL, photocurrent, CO 2 adsorption and hydrogen production experiments suggest that, in the visible-light-driven photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O, the Al 2 O 3 support triggers enhanced separation of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs, CO 2 adsorption and production of hydrogen (or proton) for reducing CO 2 .This will definitely increase the amount of the electrons, CO 2 and hydrogen (or proton) participating in the photoreduction of CO 2 , thus leading to the enhanced CO evolution from the photoreduction of CO 2 on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 . Reactions possibly occurring during the visible-light-driven photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O to form CO on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 are listed as Eqs.( 1)-(9) (Eqs.( 1)-( 9)).Light absorption by CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 leads to the formation of the electron-hole pairs (Eq.( 1)).Capture of the photogenerated holes by the TEOA produces TEOA (Eq.( 2)).H 2 O can be split into an H atom and an OH -in the presence of the photogenerated electrons (Eq.( 3)).Reaction of OH -with TEOA results in an OH group and a TEOA molecule (Eq.( 4)).Reaction of CO 2 with the proton and photogenerated electron (Eq.( 5)), or/and with the H atom (Eq.( 6)), produces CO and an OH group.ESR experiments were conducted for studying the formation of the hydroxyl radicals by using DMPO as the radical probe.The evident DMPO-OH signals indicate the presence of the OH radicals (Fig. S11 in the Supplementary Data) 48.The protons (or H atoms) can combine together to form H 2 (Eqs.( 7) and ( 8)), and the OH groups can be converted into O 2 and H 2 O (Eqs.( 9)).During the conversion of CO 2 into CO through reactions 5 and 6, carbon and bicarbonate species could be the key intermediates.We analyzed the influence of the photoreduction on the photocatalyst by conducting XRD measurement.As shown in Fig. 1a, the XRD pattern of the photocatalyst after the photoreduction of 16 h is similar to that of the photocatalyst before the photoreduction.This indicates that there is almost no change on the properties of the photocatalyst. The Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalyst has been widely used in industry 495051.Sulfur poisoning, which can convert nickel into nickel sulfide, is one of the most serious problems negatively affecting the activity, selectivity and stability of the Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalyst 495051.Generally, the sulfurpoisoned Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalyst is discarded or regenerated through complex processes.Our present work indicates that the sulfur-poisoned Ni/ Al 2 O 3 catalyst could be excellent cocatalysts for the photoreduction of CO 2 .This opens a new way for the application of the sulfur-poisoned Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalyst. In conclusion, a highly efficient CO evolution, with an evolution rate of 12.1 mol h -1 , is achieved from the photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O on a noble-metal-free CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 photocatalyst, under the irradiation of visible light ( 420 nm) which is the main part of sunlight.The CO evolution rate on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 is comparable to that on the noble-metal-based CdS/Pt/Al 2 O 3 photocatalyst (10.6 mol h -1 ), but 11 times higher than that on the Al 2 O 3 -free CdS/ Ni 9 S 8 (1.1 mol h -1 ) photocatalyst.The Al 2 O 3 support triggers improved separation of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs, CO 2 adsorption and production of protons for reducing CO 2 .This is responsible for the enhanced CO evolution on the CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .These results are helpful for fabricating low-cost noble-metal-free photocatalysts for more efficient photoreduction of CO 2 . Fig.1ashows the XRD pattern of Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .On the XRD pattern, all of the peaks are attributed to the orthorhombic Ni 9 S 8 (PDF22- 1193).There is no XRD peak assigned to Al 2 O 3 for Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 , indicating that the Al 2 O 3 support is amorphous.Fig.1b and cillustrate the N 2 absorption-desorption curves and pore size distribution for Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .From the N 2 absorption-desorption experiment, the BET surface area of Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 is calculated to be 143 m 2 g -1 .The XPS spectra of the Ni and S on Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 are shown in Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Data.Six peaks at 853.1, 856.2, 861.4,870.3, 873.8 and 880.2 eV, respectively, are present on the XPS spectrum of Ni (Fig.S2a).The peaks at 853.1, 856.2 and 870.3 eV are attributed to the 2p 3/2 , 2p 3/2 and 2p 1/2 of Ni in Ni 9 S 8 , respectively252627.The peaks at 861.4, 873.8 and 880.2 eV are caused by the Ni in Ni-O bonds25,26.The XPS peak of S can be fitted into peaks at 161.3, 162.0, 162.7, 163.6, 166.3 and 168.2 eV, respectively (Fig.S2b).The peaks at 161.3 and 166.3 eV are assigned to the 2p 1/2 of S in Ni 9 S 8 , and the peaks at 162.0, 162.7 and 163.6 eV are due to the 2p 3/2 of S in Ni 9 S 8252627.The peak at 168.2 eV is caused by the S in the SeO bonds282930.The XPS results indicate that, besides the Ni-S bonds in Ni 9 S 8 , there are also Ni-O and SeO bonds on Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .The Ni-O and SeO bonds could be formed through the bonding interactions of the Ni and S atoms in Ni 9 S 8 with the O atoms on the Al 2 O 3 support, and could be the main drive to anchor Ni 9 S 8 on the Al 2 O 3 support.Fig. 2a and b illustrate the TEM images of Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .The Ni 9 S 8 nanoparticles are dispersed on the Al 2 O 3 support.The lattice fringes with distances of 0.183 and 0.237 nm are due to the (115) and (330) planes of the orthorhombic Ni 9 S 8 , respectively, indicating the presence of the orthorhombic Ni 9 S 8 on Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .This is in good agreement with the XRD and XPS results. CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 CdS nanoparticles with an average size of about 5 nm (Fig. S3 in the Supplementary Data) were next loaded on Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 to form the CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 photocatalyst.The CdS nanoparticles in the cubic phase of CdS (Fig. Fig. 2c-e show the HRTEM image and elemental mapping patterns for CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .The lattice fringe Fig. 1.(a) XRD patterns for Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 , CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 before reaction and CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 after reaction.(b) N 2 adsorption-desorption curves and (c) pore size distributions for Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 and CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .

Reaction conditions: 100 ml water solution containing 10 vol TEOA, 100 mg photocatalyst, 300 W Xe-lamp ( 420 nm). Roles of CdS, Ni 9 S 8 and Al 2 O 3 in the photoreduction During the photoreduction of CO 2 , the CdS nanoparticles are responsible for the absorption of the visible light, as indicated by the UV-vis spectra (Fig. S4).The Ni 9 S 8 nanoparticles play as the cocatalysts providing the active sites for the photocatalytic reactions, as reflected by the low CO evolution on CdS/Al 2 O 3 (Fig. 3a) as well as the comparable CO evolution on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 to that on CdS/Pt/Al 2 O 3 .The much higher CO evolution on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 than that on CdS/ Ni 9 S 8 suggests that the Al 2 O 3 support plays an important role in the visible-light-driven photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O.For investigating the role of the Al 2 O 3 support, we studied the ability of the photocatalysts in separating the photogenerated electron-hole pairs, adsorbing CO 2 and producing protons from H 2 O splitting, which are the key factors affecting the photoreduction efficiency of CO 2 .Fig. 4a plots the PL spectra of CdS, CdS/Ni 9 S 8 and CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 . Fig. 5a plots the CO 2 adsorption capacity of CdS, Ni 9 S 8 , Al 2 O 3 , CdS/ Ni 9 S 8 , Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 and CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .The CO 2 adsorption capacity of CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 is 1.53 mmol g -1 , which is higher than those of CdS (0.12 mmol g -1 ), Ni 9 S 8 (0.49 mmol g -1 ) and Al 2 O 3 (1.15mmol g -1 ).The CO 2 adsorption capacity of CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 is about 2.5 and 1.1 times higher than those on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 (0.62 mmol g -1 ) and Ni 9 S 8 / Al 2 O 3 (1.40 mmol g -1 ), respectively.The interface and synergetic effect among different components may enhance the CO 2 adsorption on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .We have explored the O 1 s XPS spectrum of Ni 9 S 8 / Al 2 O 3 , as shown in Fig. S10 in the Supplementary Data.The XPS peaks at 530.9, 531.8, and 532.7 eV are attributed to the O 2-ion in the Al 2 O 3 structure (O a ), oxygen vacancies (O b ) and near-surface oxygen (O c ), respectively 38.The ratio of O b to the total oxygen species is 44 based on the calculation of O b /(O a O b O c Fig. 4.

(ii) Ex. with CO 2 , H 2 O and light, but without CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 ; (iii) Ex. with CdS/ Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 , light and H 2 O, but without CO 2 .No CO is generated in all of the Ex., implying that CO is from the visible-light-driven photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .Besides, an isotopic experiment with 454647minate, whereas on the FTIR spectra of Al 2 O 3 and CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 , the main bands are those assigned to the carbonate and bicarbonate species.As such, the presence of the Al 2 O 3 support triggers the formation of the carbonate and bicarbonate species from CO 2 adsorption.Previous DFT calculations demonstrated that, on the Al 2 O 3 -supported catalysts, the carbonate species are formed upon CO 2 adsorption, and then converted into bicarbonate species through protonation process in which the protons of the hydroxyl groups on the Al 2 O 3 support are transferred to one of the oxygen atoms of the carbonate species8,39,43,44.The carbonate and bicarbonate species have been shown to be the key intermediates for CO 2 conversion454647.Therefore, the formation of the carbonate and bicarbonate species resulted from the presence of the Al 2 O 3 support could be one of the reasons for the enhanced CO evolution on CdS/ Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 as compared with CdS/Ni 9 S 8 without the Al 2 O 3 support.Fig. 6 shows the activity of the photocatalysts for producing hydrogen in the visible-light-driven photocatalytic H 2 O splitting.There is no hydrogen evolution from Al 2 O 3 , CdS/Ni/Al 2 O 3 , Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 and CdS/NiO/Al 2 O 3 .Hydrogen was detected on CdS and CdS/Al 2 O 3 , but the evolution rates are only 3.6 and 5.4 mol h -1 , respectively.On CdS/Ni 9 S 8 , the hydrogen production is enhanced, with an evolution rate of 30.8 mol h -1 .As compared with CdS/Ni 9 S 8 , the hydrogen evolution rate on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 increases further, with a value of 84.1 mol h -1 .The quantum efficiency (QE) of CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 in hydrogen production is shown in Fig. (5)/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 hv h e -(1)h TEOA TEOA (2)H 2 O e - H OH -(3)OH - TEOA TEOA OH (4)CO 2 H e - CO OH(5) Acknowledgements This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos.21503062, U1662138, 21878203, and 21406153), Shanxi International Cooperation Project (No. 201703D421037), Shanxi Province Science Foundation for Youths (No. 201601D202019), Shanxi Provincial Key Innovative Research Team in Science and Technology (No. 2014131006), Scientific and Technological Innovation Programs of Higher Education Institutions in Shanxi (No. 2017137), and Program for the Outstanding Innovative Teams of Higher Learning Institutions of Shanxi (154010146-s).

For fabricating Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 , MIL-110 (Al) was firstly synthesized hydrothermally in the presence of trimethyl 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate (Me 3 btc) 21.MIL-110 (Al) is one of the metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) which are promising templates for forming catalysts via calcinations 222324.The porous structures of the catalysts prepared by using MOFs as the templates are similar to those of the MOF templates.This is benefit for achieving a high dispersion of the metal nanoparticles, even at a high metal content.The preparation of MIL-110 (Al) proceeded through the following steps.In the first step, 1.426 g of Al (NO 3 ) 3 9H 2 O (Tianjin Kermel Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd, AR, 99.0) was dissolved into 22 ml of deionized (DI) water.In the second step, 0.478 g of Me 3 btc was added into the solution obtained in the first step under vigorous stirring.In the third step, 2.2 ml of NaOH (4 M) was introduced to form a white emulsion, followed by adding HNO 3 (4 M) to adjust the pH value to about 3.9.After stirring for another 30 min, the mixture obtained in the third step was transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless steel at 200 C for 3 h.The sample obtained from the hydrothermal process was washed with DI water and further purified by dimethyl formamide (DMF, Tianjin Kermel Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd, AR, 99.5).The product was thoroughly washed with ethanol for several times to remove DMF and filtered, and dried at 80 C for 12 h, leading to the formation of the yellowish powdered MIL-110 (Al).Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Data shows the XRD and SEM results of MIL-110 (Al).The MIL-110 (Al) exhibits a rod-like morphology and a XRD pattern characteristic of MOF. Incipient wetness impregnation was used to load nickel precursor into MIL-110 (Al).Typically, 3.78 g of Ni(NO 3 ) 2 6H 2 O (Sinopharm chemical Reagent Co. Ltd., AR, 98.0) was dissolved in a DMF solution.5 g of MIL-110 (Al) was then impregnated with the Ni-contained DMF solution for 12 h.As-obtained sample was dried at 120 C for 12 h. The Ni-impregnated MIL-110 (Al) was next sulfured in a fixed-bed tubular reactor.In the first step of the sulfuration, the temperature of the reactor was increased to 350 C in N 2 with a flowing rate of 20 ml min -1 .And then, the N 2 was stopped, and H 2 containing dimethyl sulfide (CH 3 SCH 3 ) as the sulfur source was introduced into the reactor (15 ml min -1 ).A syringe pump was used to inject the CH 3 SCH 3 liquid into the H 2 stream (0.5 ml min -1 ).The sulfuration proceeded for 6 h. After sulfuration of 6 h, the temperature of the reactor was decreased to room temperature in N 2 (20 ml min -1 ), producing Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .For comparison, we also prepared Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 by using the thiophene, carbon disulfide and dimethyl disulfide as the sulfur sources through the process same as that by using the dimethyl sulfide. For comparison, NiO/Al 2 O 3 was prepared by calcining the Ni-impregnated MIL-110 (Al) in air at 400 C for 3 h, and Ni/Al 2 O 3 was fabricated by the same procedure as the sulfuration but only with hydrogen for reduction and without the addition of sulfide species. Loading of CdS nanoparticles on Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 , denoted as CdS/ Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 , was proceeded in 200 ml of aqueous solution containing 10 vol triethanoamine (TEOA) as the sacrificial reagent.Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 (160 mg) and CdS nanoparticles (40 mg) were added into the solution under ultrasonication for 2 h.The mixture was then divided into two parts.One part (100 mL) was centrifuged to collect the solid sample which was washed with ethanol and DI water for several times and subsequently dried in a vacuum freeze drier for further characterization.The other part (100 mL) was used for the visible-light-driven photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O. For preparing CdS/Pt, the CdS nanoparticles (20 mg) were dispersed in 1 ml of water solution of H 2 PtCl 6 6H 2 O, with a Pt content of 2.0 mg mL -1 , under ultrasonication for 30 min, depositing Pt ions onto the CdS nanoparticles.And then, the sample was irradiated for 1 h by using a 300 W Xe-lamp, reducing Pt ions into Pt 0 .Finally, the solid sample was harvested by centrifugation, washed with ethanol and DI water for several times, and dried under vacuum at 25 C for 12 h, fabricating CdS/Pt. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on an X' Pert Pro diffractometer equipped with Cu K radiation (scanning rate: 4m in -1 ).An ASAP 2020 analyzer (Micromeritics, Norcross, GA, USA) was used to explore the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas.UV-vis spectra were obtained on a UV-3101 Shimadzu spectrophotometer.The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out on an ESCALAB250Xi X-ray photoelectron spectrometer with a monochromatic X-ray source manufactured by Thermo.The binding energy was calibrated using the C 1 s peak (284.6 eV).Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations, including high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) and elemental mapping, were performed on a Philips TECNAI G 2 F30 system (beam energy: 200 kV).The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) measurements were conducted on a Bruker Tensor-27 spectrometer (resolution: 4 cm -1 ).A Fluoromax-3 spectrometer (Horiba Scientific) was used to collect the photoluminescence (PL) spectra.The inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) measurements were conducted on a Thermo X series 2 ICP-MS spectrometer.A Bruker EMXplus-10/12 spectrometer was applied for obtaining the electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra, with a microwave frequency of 9.64 GHz and a modulation amplitude of 2 G. 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO, 98.0;Sigma Chemical Co.) was used as the spin-trap reagent for the hydroxyl radicals. Transient photocurrents were measured on a CHI660 A electrochemical workstation in a Na 2 SO 4 solution (0.1 M) containing TEOA (10 vol ), by using a 300 W Xe-lamp equipped with a cut-off filter ( 420 nm), with a constant potential of 0.35 V vs. standard electrode (SCE).The solution and light source used for measuring the photocurrent are similar to those for the photocatalytic reactions.The workstation includes three electrodes.The working electrode, with a surface area of 1.44 cm 2 exposed to the electrolyte, was prepared by placing the sample on indium tin oxide (ITO) glasses.Pt and a saturated calomel electrode were used as the counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively.For preparing the working electrode, with a surface area of 1.44 cm 2 exposed to the electrolyte, 1 mg sample was firstly dispersed in 1 ml ethanol containing naphthol (0.05 wt) under ultrasonication.Then, the suspension was dropped onto ITO glasses, and dried at room temperature.The CO 2 adsorption capacities of the samples were examined on an ASAP 2020 analyzer (Micromeritics, Norcross, GA, USA), with pressures ranging from 0 to 1.01 bar, at 25 C.Before the adsorption experiments, the samples were degassed at 200 C for 12 h. The photoreduction was performed in a closed gas circulation-evacuation reactor, with H 2 O as the reductant, under the irradiation of visible light ( 420 nm).Before reaction, the following three steps were carried out.Firstly, 100 mg photocatalyst was dispersed in a H 2 O solution (100 mL) containing TEOA (10 vol) which serve as sacrificial reagents for capturing the photogenerated holes, in the reactor.And then, the reactor was evacuated and refilled with pure CO 2 gas for three times to remove the air inside.Finally, the reactor was filled with CO 2 until the pressure of the reactor reaching to the atmospheric pressure (101.325kPa).In the photocatalytic reduction, the reactor was irradiated with a Xe-lamp (300 W) equipped with a cut-off filter ( 420 nm) under stirring, and the temperature of the reactor was kept at 25 C by using cooling water.The products were detected by a gas chromatography (Agilent 7890 A) with both with Flame Ionization (FID) and Thermal Conductivity (TCD) detectors.The FID detector and an Agilent HPPLOT Q capillary column were used for analyzing methanol, while the TCD detector and a Porapak Q packed column were used for analyzing H 2 , O 2 , CO 2 , CO and CH 4 .Ar was used as the carrier gas.The GC was switched between the two columns by using a fourport valve.To determine the source of the carbon in the products, an isotopic experiment was carried out under the identical reaction conditions using 13 CO 2 (99.99 in purity), and the products were analyzed by a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Fig. 1a shows the XRD pattern of Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .On the XRD pattern, all of the peaks are attributed to the orthorhombic Ni 9 S 8 (PDF .There is no XRD peak assigned to Al 2 O 3 for Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 , indicating that the Al 2 O 3 support is amorphous.Fig. 1b andc 25,26.The XPS peak of S can be fitted into peaks at 161.3, 162.0, 162.7, 163.6, 166.3 and 168.2 eV, respectively (Fig. S2b).The peaks at 161.3 and 166.3 eV are assigned to the 2p 1/2 of S in Ni 9 S 8 , and the peaks at 162.0, 162.7 and 163.6 eV are due to the 2p 3/2 of S in Ni 9 S 8 252627.The peak at 168.2 eV is caused by the S in the SeO bonds 282930 S3) were fabricated via the hot-injection method which has been reported in detail elsewhere 313233.On the XRD pattern of CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 (Fig. 1a), besides the peaks of the orthorhombic Ni 9 S 8 , a peak at 26.5assigned to the (111) plane of the cubic CdS also appears (PDF80-0019). The performance of CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 and control samples in the visible-light-driven photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O were next explored by using the aqueous solution containing TEOA (10 vol) as a hole scavenger.The results are plotted in Fig. 3 and Fig. S5 in the Supplementary Data.During the experiments, CO is the main the product.In addition to CO, there is some methanol detected during the photocatalytic reactions, but the evolution rate of the methanol is lower than 0.1 mol h -1 .As reflected in Figs.3a andS5 Supplementary Data), an optimum CO evolution rate of 10. 13 CO 2 as the reactant was also done for determining the source of the carbon in CO.The m/z at 29 on the GC-MS spectrum is caused by 13 CO (Fig. S9 in the Supplementary Data), further revealing that CO is from the visible-light-driven photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .An evident peak at 490 nm, which is assigned to the recombination of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs, appears on the PL spectrum of CdS.This is in good agreement with the PL results reported previously for CdS 31323334.On CdS/Ni 9 S 8 and CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 , the PL peak at 490 nm is quenched significantly, implying an efficient electron-hole separation.The photocurrents of CdS, CdS/Ni 9 S 8 and CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 are illustrated in Fig. 4b.The photocurrent on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 is 0.42 mA cm -2 , which is much higher than those on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 (0.33 mA cm -2 ) and CdS (0.02 mA cm -2 ).Thus, on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 , the electron-hole recombination is efficiently suppressed, and more photogenerated electrons are transferred into the measuring circuit during the photocurrent experiments.The PL and photocurrent results indicate that the Al 2 O 3 support triggers more efficient electron-hole separation during the photocatalytic reaction.As reported previously, in photocatalysis, highly conductive supports, such as reduced graphene oxide and carbon nanotubes, can efficiently promote the separation of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs 18,353637.Our present results suggest that the Al 2 O 3 support, which has a poor conductivity, is also excellent in separating the photogenerated electronhole pairs.This could be originated from the defects and the hydroxyl groups on the Al 2 O 3 support.).The oxygen vacancies could also make some contributions to the enhanced CO 2 adsorption on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 39.As such, the Al 2 O 3 support triggers an improved CO 2 adsorption on the photocatalyst.Fig. 5b illustrates the dependence of the adsorption heat on the amount of CO 2 adsorbed, estimated by the Clausius-Clapeyron equation 404142.For all of the samples, the adsorption heat decreases with increasing CO 2 coverage, and the highest adsorption heat is obtained at the onset of CO 2 adsorption.For CdS, the highest adsorption heat is only 11.2 kJ mol -1 .With increasing the CO 2 adsorption coverage, the adsorption heat on CdS is close to zero.The low adsorption heat indicates that the CO 2 adsorption on CdS may be physical adsorption without any structural change occurring on the linear CO 2 molecule (OeCeO angle: 180) 8.The physical adsorption could be responsible for the low CO 2 adsorption capacity of CdS (Fig. 5a).The adsorption heats of Ni 9 S 8 and CdS/Ni 9 S 8 are similar, with the highest value of about 55.0 kJ mol -1 .The highest adsorption heat of CO 2 on Al 2 O 3 is 65.0 kJ mol -1 , which is in good agreement with the adsorption heat obtained from the density functional theory (DFT) calculations in our previous papers 39,43,44.The highest adsorption heat of CO 2 on -species, with a bent structure in which the OeCeO angle is about 140 39,43,44.The bands at 1230 and 1420 cm -1 are caused by the bidentate and monodentate carbonate species (CO 3 2-), respectively 8,39,43,44.The bands at 1535 and 1640 cm -1 are due to the bicarbonate species (HCO 3 -) formed from the protonation reaction between the carbonate species and the hydroxyl groups on the photocatalyst 8,39,43,44.On the FTIR spectrum of Ni 9 S 8 , the bands due to the CO 6b.With the wavelength increasing from 420 to 520 nm, the QE of CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 becomes higher firstly, and then decreases, with the highest QE (20.4) presents at 460 nm.The photocatalytic stability of CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 was examined in four consecutive runs with each run of 4 h, and there is nothing to do but evacuate the reactor between two runs.As shown in Fig. 6c, CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 has a good stability in hydrogen production.There is almost no decrease of the total amount of the hydrogen produced after four runs on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .These results show that the Al 2 O 3 support triggers an enhanced hydrogen production (proton production) from the visible-light-driven photocatalytic H 2 O splitting. PL, photocurrent, CO 2 adsorption and hydrogen production experiments suggest that, in the visible-light-driven photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O, the Al 2 O 3 support triggers enhanced separation of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs, CO 2 adsorption and production of hydrogen (or proton) for reducing CO 2 .This will definitely increase the amount of the electrons, CO 2 and hydrogen (or proton) participating in the photoreduction of CO 2 , thus leading to the enhanced CO evolution from the photoreduction of CO 2 on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 . Reactions possibly occurring during the visible-light-driven photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O to form CO on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 are listed as Eqs.( 1)-(9) (Eqs.( 1)-( 9)).Light absorption by CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 leads to the formation of the electron-hole pairs (Eq.( 1)).Capture of the photogenerated holes by the TEOA produces TEOA (Eq.( 2)).H 2 O can be split into an H atom and an OH -in the presence of the photogenerated electrons (Eq.( 3)).Reaction of OH -with TEOA results in an OH group and a TEOA molecule (Eq.( 4)).Reaction of CO 2 with the proton and photogenerated electron (Eq.( 5)), or/and with the H atom (Eq.( 6)), produces CO and an OH group.ESR experiments were conducted for studying the formation of the hydroxyl radicals by using DMPO as the radical probe.The evident DMPO-OH signals indicate the presence of the OH radicals (Fig. S11 in the Supplementary Data) 48.The protons (or H atoms) can combine together to form H 2 (Eqs.( 7) and ( 8)), and the OH groups can be converted into O 2 and H 2 O (Eqs.( 9)).During the conversion of CO 2 into CO through reactions 5 and 6, carbon and bicarbonate species could be the key intermediates.We analyzed the influence of the photoreduction on the photocatalyst by conducting XRD measurement.As shown in Fig. 1a, the XRD pattern of the photocatalyst after the photoreduction of 16 h is similar to that of the photocatalyst before the photoreduction.This indicates that there is almost no change on the properties of the photocatalyst. The Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalyst has been widely used in industry 495051.Sulfur poisoning, which can convert nickel into nickel sulfide, is one of the most serious problems negatively affecting the activity, selectivity and stability of the Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalyst 495051.Generally, the sulfurpoisoned Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalyst is discarded or regenerated through complex processes.Our present work indicates that the sulfur-poisoned Ni/ Al 2 O 3 catalyst could be excellent cocatalysts for the photoreduction of CO 2 .This opens a new way for the application of the sulfur-poisoned Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalyst. In conclusion, a highly efficient CO evolution, with an evolution rate of 12.1 mol h -1 , is achieved from the photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O on a noble-metal-free CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 photocatalyst, under the irradiation of visible light ( 420 nm) which is the main part of sunlight.The CO evolution rate on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 is comparable to that on the noble-metal-based CdS/Pt/Al 2 O 3 photocatalyst (10.6 mol h -1 ), but 11 times higher than that on the Al 2 O 3 -free CdS/ Ni 9 S 8 (1.1 mol h -1 ) photocatalyst.The Al 2 O 3 support triggers improved separation of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs, CO 2 adsorption and production of protons for reducing CO 2 .This is responsible for the enhanced CO evolution on the CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .These results are helpful for fabricating low-cost noble-metal-free photocatalysts for more efficient photoreduction of CO 2 . Fig.1ashows the XRD pattern of Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .On the XRD pattern, all of the peaks are attributed to the orthorhombic Ni 9 S 8 (PDF22- 1193).There is no XRD peak assigned to Al 2 O 3 for Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 , indicating that the Al 2 O 3 support is amorphous.Fig.1b and cillustrate the N 2 absorption-desorption curves and pore size distribution for Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .From the N 2 absorption-desorption experiment, the BET surface area of Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 is calculated to be 143 m 2 g -1 .The XPS spectra of the Ni and S on Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 are shown in Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Data.Six peaks at 853.1, 856.2, 861.4,870.3, 873.8 and 880.2 eV, respectively, are present on the XPS spectrum of Ni (Fig.S2a).The peaks at 853.1, 856.2 and 870.3 eV are attributed to the 2p 3/2 , 2p 3/2 and 2p 1/2 of Ni in Ni 9 S 8 , respectively252627.The peaks at 861.4, 873.8 and 880.2 eV are caused by the Ni in Ni-O bonds25,26.The XPS peak of S can be fitted into peaks at 161.3, 162.0, 162.7, 163.6, 166.3 and 168.2 eV, respectively (Fig.S2b).The peaks at 161.3 and 166.3 eV are assigned to the 2p 1/2 of S in Ni 9 S 8 , and the peaks at 162.0, 162.7 and 163.6 eV are due to the 2p 3/2 of S in Ni 9 S 8252627.The peak at 168.2 eV is caused by the S in the SeO bonds282930.The XPS results indicate that, besides the Ni-S bonds in Ni 9 S 8 , there are also Ni-O and SeO bonds on Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .The Ni-O and SeO bonds could be formed through the bonding interactions of the Ni and S atoms in Ni 9 S 8 with the O atoms on the Al 2 O 3 support, and could be the main drive to anchor Ni 9 S 8 on the Al 2 O 3 support.Fig. 2a and b illustrate the TEM images of Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .The Ni 9 S 8 nanoparticles are dispersed on the Al 2 O 3 support.The lattice fringes with distances of 0.183 and 0.237 nm are due to the (115) and (330) planes of the orthorhombic Ni 9 S 8 , respectively, indicating the presence of the orthorhombic Ni 9 S 8 on Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .This is in good agreement with the XRD and XPS results. CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 CdS nanoparticles with an average size of about 5 nm (Fig. S3 in the Supplementary Data) were next loaded on Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 to form the CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 photocatalyst.The CdS nanoparticles in the cubic phase of CdS (Fig. Fig. 2c-e show the HRTEM image and elemental mapping patterns for CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .The lattice fringe Fig. 1.(a) XRD patterns for Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 , CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 before reaction and CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 after reaction.(b) N 2 adsorption-desorption curves and (c) pore size distributions for Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 and CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .

Reaction conditions: 100 ml water solution containing 10 vol TEOA, 100 mg photocatalyst, 300 W Xe-lamp ( 420 nm). Roles of CdS, Ni 9 S 8 and Al 2 O 3 in the photoreduction During the photoreduction of CO 2 , the CdS nanoparticles are responsible for the absorption of the visible light, as indicated by the UV-vis spectra (Fig. S4).The Ni 9 S 8 nanoparticles play as the cocatalysts providing the active sites for the photocatalytic reactions, as reflected by the low CO evolution on CdS/Al 2 O 3 (Fig. 3a) as well as the comparable CO evolution on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 to that on CdS/Pt/Al 2 O 3 .The much higher CO evolution on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 than that on CdS/ Ni 9 S 8 suggests that the Al 2 O 3 support plays an important role in the visible-light-driven photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O.For investigating the role of the Al 2 O 3 support, we studied the ability of the photocatalysts in separating the photogenerated electron-hole pairs, adsorbing CO 2 and producing protons from H 2 O splitting, which are the key factors affecting the photoreduction efficiency of CO 2 .Fig. 4a plots the PL spectra of CdS, CdS/Ni 9 S 8 and CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 . Fig. 5a plots the CO 2 adsorption capacity of CdS, Ni 9 S 8 , Al 2 O 3 , CdS/ Ni 9 S 8 , Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 and CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .The CO 2 adsorption capacity of CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 is 1.53 mmol g -1 , which is higher than those of CdS (0.12 mmol g -1 ), Ni 9 S 8 (0.49 mmol g -1 ) and Al 2 O 3 (1.15mmol g -1 ).The CO 2 adsorption capacity of CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 is about 2.5 and 1.1 times higher than those on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 (0.62 mmol g -1 ) and Ni 9 S 8 / Al 2 O 3 (1.40 mmol g -1 ), respectively.The interface and synergetic effect among different components may enhance the CO 2 adsorption on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .We have explored the O 1 s XPS spectrum of Ni 9 S 8 / Al 2 O 3 , as shown in Fig. S10 in the Supplementary Data.The XPS peaks at 530.9, 531.8, and 532.7 eV are attributed to the O 2-ion in the Al 2 O 3 structure (O a ), oxygen vacancies (O b ) and near-surface oxygen (O c ), respectively 38.The ratio of O b to the total oxygen species is 44 based on the calculation of O b /(O a O b O c Fig. 4.

(ii) Ex. with CO 2 , H 2 O and light, but without CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 ; (iii) Ex. with CdS/ Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 , light and H 2 O, but without CO 2 .No CO is generated in all of the Ex., implying that CO is from the visible-light-driven photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .Besides, an isotopic experiment with 454647minate, whereas on the FTIR spectra of Al 2 O 3 and CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 , the main bands are those assigned to the carbonate and bicarbonate species.As such, the presence of the Al 2 O 3 support triggers the formation of the carbonate and bicarbonate species from CO 2 adsorption.Previous DFT calculations demonstrated that, on the Al 2 O 3 -supported catalysts, the carbonate species are formed upon CO 2 adsorption, and then converted into bicarbonate species through protonation process in which the protons of the hydroxyl groups on the Al 2 O 3 support are transferred to one of the oxygen atoms of the carbonate species8,39,43,44.The carbonate and bicarbonate species have been shown to be the key intermediates for CO 2 conversion454647.Therefore, the formation of the carbonate and bicarbonate species resulted from the presence of the Al 2 O 3 support could be one of the reasons for the enhanced CO evolution on CdS/ Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 as compared with CdS/Ni 9 S 8 without the Al 2 O 3 support.Fig. 6 shows the activity of the photocatalysts for producing hydrogen in the visible-light-driven photocatalytic H 2 O splitting.There is no hydrogen evolution from Al 2 O 3 , CdS/Ni/Al 2 O 3 , Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 and CdS/NiO/Al 2 O 3 .Hydrogen was detected on CdS and CdS/Al 2 O 3 , but the evolution rates are only 3.6 and 5.4 mol h -1 , respectively.On CdS/Ni 9 S 8 , the hydrogen production is enhanced, with an evolution rate of 30.8 mol h -1 .As compared with CdS/Ni 9 S 8 , the hydrogen evolution rate on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 increases further, with a value of 84.1 mol h -1 .The quantum efficiency (QE) of CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 in hydrogen production is shown in Fig. (5)/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 hv h e -(1)h TEOA TEOA (2)H 2 O e - H OH -(3)OH - TEOA TEOA OH (4)CO 2 H e - CO OH(5) Acknowledgements This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos.21503062, U1662138, 21878203, and 21406153), Shanxi International Cooperation Project (No. 201703D421037), Shanxi Province Science Foundation for Youths (No. 201601D202019), Shanxi Provincial Key Innovative Research Team in Science and Technology (No. 2014131006), Scientific and Technological Innovation Programs of Higher Education Institutions in Shanxi (No. 2017137), and Program for the Outstanding Innovative Teams of Higher Learning Institutions of Shanxi (154010146-s).

For fabricating Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 , MIL-110 (Al) was firstly synthesized hydrothermally in the presence of trimethyl 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate (Me 3 btc) 21.MIL-110 (Al) is one of the metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) which are promising templates for forming catalysts via calcinations 222324.The porous structures of the catalysts prepared by using MOFs as the templates are similar to those of the MOF templates.This is benefit for achieving a high dispersion of the metal nanoparticles, even at a high metal content.The preparation of MIL-110 (Al) proceeded through the following steps.In the first step, 1.426 g of Al (NO 3 ) 3 9H 2 O (Tianjin Kermel Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd, AR, 99.0) was dissolved into 22 ml of deionized (DI) water.In the second step, 0.478 g of Me 3 btc was added into the solution obtained in the first step under vigorous stirring.In the third step, 2.2 ml of NaOH (4 M) was introduced to form a white emulsion, followed by adding HNO 3 (4 M) to adjust the pH value to about 3.9.After stirring for another 30 min, the mixture obtained in the third step was transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless steel at 200 C for 3 h.The sample obtained from the hydrothermal process was washed with DI water and further purified by dimethyl formamide (DMF, Tianjin Kermel Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd, AR, 99.5).The product was thoroughly washed with ethanol for several times to remove DMF and filtered, and dried at 80 C for 12 h, leading to the formation of the yellowish powdered MIL-110 (Al).Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Data shows the XRD and SEM results of MIL-110 (Al).The MIL-110 (Al) exhibits a rod-like morphology and a XRD pattern characteristic of MOF. Incipient wetness impregnation was used to load nickel precursor into MIL-110 (Al).Typically, 3.78 g of Ni(NO 3 ) 2 6H 2 O (Sinopharm chemical Reagent Co. Ltd., AR, 98.0) was dissolved in a DMF solution.5 g of MIL-110 (Al) was then impregnated with the Ni-contained DMF solution for 12 h.As-obtained sample was dried at 120 C for 12 h. The Ni-impregnated MIL-110 (Al) was next sulfured in a fixed-bed tubular reactor.In the first step of the sulfuration, the temperature of the reactor was increased to 350 C in N 2 with a flowing rate of 20 ml min -1 .And then, the N 2 was stopped, and H 2 containing dimethyl sulfide (CH 3 SCH 3 ) as the sulfur source was introduced into the reactor (15 ml min -1 ).A syringe pump was used to inject the CH 3 SCH 3 liquid into the H 2 stream (0.5 ml min -1 ).The sulfuration proceeded for 6 h. After sulfuration of 6 h, the temperature of the reactor was decreased to room temperature in N 2 (20 ml min -1 ), producing Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .For comparison, we also prepared Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 by using the thiophene, carbon disulfide and dimethyl disulfide as the sulfur sources through the process same as that by using the dimethyl sulfide. For comparison, NiO/Al 2 O 3 was prepared by calcining the Ni-impregnated MIL-110 (Al) in air at 400 C for 3 h, and Ni/Al 2 O 3 was fabricated by the same procedure as the sulfuration but only with hydrogen for reduction and without the addition of sulfide species. Loading of CdS nanoparticles on Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 , denoted as CdS/ Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 , was proceeded in 200 ml of aqueous solution containing 10 vol triethanoamine (TEOA) as the sacrificial reagent.Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 (160 mg) and CdS nanoparticles (40 mg) were added into the solution under ultrasonication for 2 h.The mixture was then divided into two parts.One part (100 mL) was centrifuged to collect the solid sample which was washed with ethanol and DI water for several times and subsequently dried in a vacuum freeze drier for further characterization.The other part (100 mL) was used for the visible-light-driven photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O. For preparing CdS/Pt, the CdS nanoparticles (20 mg) were dispersed in 1 ml of water solution of H 2 PtCl 6 6H 2 O, with a Pt content of 2.0 mg mL -1 , under ultrasonication for 30 min, depositing Pt ions onto the CdS nanoparticles.And then, the sample was irradiated for 1 h by using a 300 W Xe-lamp, reducing Pt ions into Pt 0 .Finally, the solid sample was harvested by centrifugation, washed with ethanol and DI water for several times, and dried under vacuum at 25 C for 12 h, fabricating CdS/Pt. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on an X' Pert Pro diffractometer equipped with Cu K radiation (scanning rate: 4m in -1 ).An ASAP 2020 analyzer (Micromeritics, Norcross, GA, USA) was used to explore the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas.UV-vis spectra were obtained on a UV-3101 Shimadzu spectrophotometer.The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out on an ESCALAB250Xi X-ray photoelectron spectrometer with a monochromatic X-ray source manufactured by Thermo.The binding energy was calibrated using the C 1 s peak (284.6 eV).Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations, including high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) and elemental mapping, were performed on a Philips TECNAI G 2 F30 system (beam energy: 200 kV).The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) measurements were conducted on a Bruker Tensor-27 spectrometer (resolution: 4 cm -1 ).A Fluoromax-3 spectrometer (Horiba Scientific) was used to collect the photoluminescence (PL) spectra.The inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) measurements were conducted on a Thermo X series 2 ICP-MS spectrometer.A Bruker EMXplus-10/12 spectrometer was applied for obtaining the electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra, with a microwave frequency of 9.64 GHz and a modulation amplitude of 2 G. 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO, 98.0;Sigma Chemical Co.) was used as the spin-trap reagent for the hydroxyl radicals. Transient photocurrents were measured on a CHI660 A electrochemical workstation in a Na 2 SO 4 solution (0.1 M) containing TEOA (10 vol ), by using a 300 W Xe-lamp equipped with a cut-off filter ( 420 nm), with a constant potential of 0.35 V vs. standard electrode (SCE).The solution and light source used for measuring the photocurrent are similar to those for the photocatalytic reactions.The workstation includes three electrodes.The working electrode, with a surface area of 1.44 cm 2 exposed to the electrolyte, was prepared by placing the sample on indium tin oxide (ITO) glasses.Pt and a saturated calomel electrode were used as the counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively.For preparing the working electrode, with a surface area of 1.44 cm 2 exposed to the electrolyte, 1 mg sample was firstly dispersed in 1 ml ethanol containing naphthol (0.05 wt) under ultrasonication.Then, the suspension was dropped onto ITO glasses, and dried at room temperature.The CO 2 adsorption capacities of the samples were examined on an ASAP 2020 analyzer (Micromeritics, Norcross, GA, USA), with pressures ranging from 0 to 1.01 bar, at 25 C.Before the adsorption experiments, the samples were degassed at 200 C for 12 h. The photoreduction was performed in a closed gas circulation-evacuation reactor, with H 2 O as the reductant, under the irradiation of visible light ( 420 nm).Before reaction, the following three steps were carried out.Firstly, 100 mg photocatalyst was dispersed in a H 2 O solution (100 mL) containing TEOA (10 vol) which serve as sacrificial reagents for capturing the photogenerated holes, in the reactor.And then, the reactor was evacuated and refilled with pure CO 2 gas for three times to remove the air inside.Finally, the reactor was filled with CO 2 until the pressure of the reactor reaching to the atmospheric pressure (101.325kPa).In the photocatalytic reduction, the reactor was irradiated with a Xe-lamp (300 W) equipped with a cut-off filter ( 420 nm) under stirring, and the temperature of the reactor was kept at 25 C by using cooling water.The products were detected by a gas chromatography (Agilent 7890 A) with both with Flame Ionization (FID) and Thermal Conductivity (TCD) detectors.The FID detector and an Agilent HPPLOT Q capillary column were used for analyzing methanol, while the TCD detector and a Porapak Q packed column were used for analyzing H 2 , O 2 , CO 2 , CO and CH 4 .Ar was used as the carrier gas.The GC was switched between the two columns by using a fourport valve.To determine the source of the carbon in the products, an isotopic experiment was carried out under the identical reaction conditions using 13 CO 2 (99.99 in purity), and the products were analyzed by a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Fig. 1a shows the XRD pattern of Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .On the XRD pattern, all of the peaks are attributed to the orthorhombic Ni 9 S 8 (PDF .There is no XRD peak assigned to Al 2 O 3 for Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 , indicating that the Al 2 O 3 support is amorphous.Fig. 1b andc 25,26.The XPS peak of S can be fitted into peaks at 161.3, 162.0, 162.7, 163.6, 166.3 and 168.2 eV, respectively (Fig. S2b).The peaks at 161.3 and 166.3 eV are assigned to the 2p 1/2 of S in Ni 9 S 8 , and the peaks at 162.0, 162.7 and 163.6 eV are due to the 2p 3/2 of S in Ni 9 S 8 252627.The peak at 168.2 eV is caused by the S in the SeO bonds 282930 S3) were fabricated via the hot-injection method which has been reported in detail elsewhere 313233.On the XRD pattern of CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 (Fig. 1a), besides the peaks of the orthorhombic Ni 9 S 8 , a peak at 26.5assigned to the (111) plane of the cubic CdS also appears (PDF80-0019). The performance of CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 and control samples in the visible-light-driven photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O were next explored by using the aqueous solution containing TEOA (10 vol) as a hole scavenger.The results are plotted in Fig. 3 and Fig. S5 in the Supplementary Data.During the experiments, CO is the main the product.In addition to CO, there is some methanol detected during the photocatalytic reactions, but the evolution rate of the methanol is lower than 0.1 mol h -1 .As reflected in Figs.3a andS5 Supplementary Data), an optimum CO evolution rate of 10. 13 CO 2 as the reactant was also done for determining the source of the carbon in CO.The m/z at 29 on the GC-MS spectrum is caused by 13 CO (Fig. S9 in the Supplementary Data), further revealing that CO is from the visible-light-driven photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .An evident peak at 490 nm, which is assigned to the recombination of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs, appears on the PL spectrum of CdS.This is in good agreement with the PL results reported previously for CdS 31323334.On CdS/Ni 9 S 8 and CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 , the PL peak at 490 nm is quenched significantly, implying an efficient electron-hole separation.The photocurrents of CdS, CdS/Ni 9 S 8 and CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 are illustrated in Fig. 4b.The photocurrent on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 is 0.42 mA cm -2 , which is much higher than those on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 (0.33 mA cm -2 ) and CdS (0.02 mA cm -2 ).Thus, on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 , the electron-hole recombination is efficiently suppressed, and more photogenerated electrons are transferred into the measuring circuit during the photocurrent experiments.The PL and photocurrent results indicate that the Al 2 O 3 support triggers more efficient electron-hole separation during the photocatalytic reaction.As reported previously, in photocatalysis, highly conductive supports, such as reduced graphene oxide and carbon nanotubes, can efficiently promote the separation of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs 18,353637.Our present results suggest that the Al 2 O 3 support, which has a poor conductivity, is also excellent in separating the photogenerated electronhole pairs.This could be originated from the defects and the hydroxyl groups on the Al 2 O 3 support.).The oxygen vacancies could also make some contributions to the enhanced CO 2 adsorption on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 39.As such, the Al 2 O 3 support triggers an improved CO 2 adsorption on the photocatalyst.Fig. 5b illustrates the dependence of the adsorption heat on the amount of CO 2 adsorbed, estimated by the Clausius-Clapeyron equation 404142.For all of the samples, the adsorption heat decreases with increasing CO 2 coverage, and the highest adsorption heat is obtained at the onset of CO 2 adsorption.For CdS, the highest adsorption heat is only 11.2 kJ mol -1 .With increasing the CO 2 adsorption coverage, the adsorption heat on CdS is close to zero.The low adsorption heat indicates that the CO 2 adsorption on CdS may be physical adsorption without any structural change occurring on the linear CO 2 molecule (OeCeO angle: 180) 8.The physical adsorption could be responsible for the low CO 2 adsorption capacity of CdS (Fig. 5a).The adsorption heats of Ni 9 S 8 and CdS/Ni 9 S 8 are similar, with the highest value of about 55.0 kJ mol -1 .The highest adsorption heat of CO 2 on Al 2 O 3 is 65.0 kJ mol -1 , which is in good agreement with the adsorption heat obtained from the density functional theory (DFT) calculations in our previous papers 39,43,44.The highest adsorption heat of CO 2 on -species, with a bent structure in which the OeCeO angle is about 140 39,43,44.The bands at 1230 and 1420 cm -1 are caused by the bidentate and monodentate carbonate species (CO 3 2-), respectively 8,39,43,44.The bands at 1535 and 1640 cm -1 are due to the bicarbonate species (HCO 3 -) formed from the protonation reaction between the carbonate species and the hydroxyl groups on the photocatalyst 8,39,43,44.On the FTIR spectrum of Ni 9 S 8 , the bands due to the CO 6b.With the wavelength increasing from 420 to 520 nm, the QE of CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 becomes higher firstly, and then decreases, with the highest QE (20.4) presents at 460 nm.The photocatalytic stability of CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 was examined in four consecutive runs with each run of 4 h, and there is nothing to do but evacuate the reactor between two runs.As shown in Fig. 6c, CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 has a good stability in hydrogen production.There is almost no decrease of the total amount of the hydrogen produced after four runs on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .These results show that the Al 2 O 3 support triggers an enhanced hydrogen production (proton production) from the visible-light-driven photocatalytic H 2 O splitting. PL, photocurrent, CO 2 adsorption and hydrogen production experiments suggest that, in the visible-light-driven photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O, the Al 2 O 3 support triggers enhanced separation of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs, CO 2 adsorption and production of hydrogen (or proton) for reducing CO 2 .This will definitely increase the amount of the electrons, CO 2 and hydrogen (or proton) participating in the photoreduction of CO 2 , thus leading to the enhanced CO evolution from the photoreduction of CO 2 on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 . Reactions possibly occurring during the visible-light-driven photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O to form CO on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 are listed as Eqs.( 1)-(9) (Eqs.( 1)-( 9)).Light absorption by CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 leads to the formation of the electron-hole pairs (Eq.( 1)).Capture of the photogenerated holes by the TEOA produces TEOA (Eq.( 2)).H 2 O can be split into an H atom and an OH -in the presence of the photogenerated electrons (Eq.( 3)).Reaction of OH -with TEOA results in an OH group and a TEOA molecule (Eq.( 4)).Reaction of CO 2 with the proton and photogenerated electron (Eq.( 5)), or/and with the H atom (Eq.( 6)), produces CO and an OH group.ESR experiments were conducted for studying the formation of the hydroxyl radicals by using DMPO as the radical probe.The evident DMPO-OH signals indicate the presence of the OH radicals (Fig. S11 in the Supplementary Data) 48.The protons (or H atoms) can combine together to form H 2 (Eqs.( 7) and ( 8)), and the OH groups can be converted into O 2 and H 2 O (Eqs.( 9)).During the conversion of CO 2 into CO through reactions 5 and 6, carbon and bicarbonate species could be the key intermediates.We analyzed the influence of the photoreduction on the photocatalyst by conducting XRD measurement.As shown in Fig. 1a, the XRD pattern of the photocatalyst after the photoreduction of 16 h is similar to that of the photocatalyst before the photoreduction.This indicates that there is almost no change on the properties of the photocatalyst. The Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalyst has been widely used in industry 495051.Sulfur poisoning, which can convert nickel into nickel sulfide, is one of the most serious problems negatively affecting the activity, selectivity and stability of the Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalyst 495051.Generally, the sulfurpoisoned Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalyst is discarded or regenerated through complex processes.Our present work indicates that the sulfur-poisoned Ni/ Al 2 O 3 catalyst could be excellent cocatalysts for the photoreduction of CO 2 .This opens a new way for the application of the sulfur-poisoned Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalyst. In conclusion, a highly efficient CO evolution, with an evolution rate of 12.1 mol h -1 , is achieved from the photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O on a noble-metal-free CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 photocatalyst, under the irradiation of visible light ( 420 nm) which is the main part of sunlight.The CO evolution rate on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 is comparable to that on the noble-metal-based CdS/Pt/Al 2 O 3 photocatalyst (10.6 mol h -1 ), but 11 times higher than that on the Al 2 O 3 -free CdS/ Ni 9 S 8 (1.1 mol h -1 ) photocatalyst.The Al 2 O 3 support triggers improved separation of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs, CO 2 adsorption and production of protons for reducing CO 2 .This is responsible for the enhanced CO evolution on the CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .These results are helpful for fabricating low-cost noble-metal-free photocatalysts for more efficient photoreduction of CO 2 . Fig.1ashows the XRD pattern of Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .On the XRD pattern, all of the peaks are attributed to the orthorhombic Ni 9 S 8 (PDF22- 1193).There is no XRD peak assigned to Al 2 O 3 for Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 , indicating that the Al 2 O 3 support is amorphous.Fig.1b and cillustrate the N 2 absorption-desorption curves and pore size distribution for Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .From the N 2 absorption-desorption experiment, the BET surface area of Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 is calculated to be 143 m 2 g -1 .The XPS spectra of the Ni and S on Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 are shown in Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Data.Six peaks at 853.1, 856.2, 861.4,870.3, 873.8 and 880.2 eV, respectively, are present on the XPS spectrum of Ni (Fig.S2a).The peaks at 853.1, 856.2 and 870.3 eV are attributed to the 2p 3/2 , 2p 3/2 and 2p 1/2 of Ni in Ni 9 S 8 , respectively252627.The peaks at 861.4, 873.8 and 880.2 eV are caused by the Ni in Ni-O bonds25,26.The XPS peak of S can be fitted into peaks at 161.3, 162.0, 162.7, 163.6, 166.3 and 168.2 eV, respectively (Fig.S2b).The peaks at 161.3 and 166.3 eV are assigned to the 2p 1/2 of S in Ni 9 S 8 , and the peaks at 162.0, 162.7 and 163.6 eV are due to the 2p 3/2 of S in Ni 9 S 8252627.The peak at 168.2 eV is caused by the S in the SeO bonds282930.The XPS results indicate that, besides the Ni-S bonds in Ni 9 S 8 , there are also Ni-O and SeO bonds on Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .The Ni-O and SeO bonds could be formed through the bonding interactions of the Ni and S atoms in Ni 9 S 8 with the O atoms on the Al 2 O 3 support, and could be the main drive to anchor Ni 9 S 8 on the Al 2 O 3 support.Fig. 2a and b illustrate the TEM images of Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .The Ni 9 S 8 nanoparticles are dispersed on the Al 2 O 3 support.The lattice fringes with distances of 0.183 and 0.237 nm are due to the (115) and (330) planes of the orthorhombic Ni 9 S 8 , respectively, indicating the presence of the orthorhombic Ni 9 S 8 on Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .This is in good agreement with the XRD and XPS results. CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 CdS nanoparticles with an average size of about 5 nm (Fig. S3 in the Supplementary Data) were next loaded on Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 to form the CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 photocatalyst.The CdS nanoparticles in the cubic phase of CdS (Fig. Fig. 2c-e show the HRTEM image and elemental mapping patterns for CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .The lattice fringe Fig. 1.(a) XRD patterns for Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 , CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 before reaction and CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 after reaction.(b) N 2 adsorption-desorption curves and (c) pore size distributions for Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 and CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .

Reaction conditions: 100 ml water solution containing 10 vol TEOA, 100 mg photocatalyst, 300 W Xe-lamp ( 420 nm). Roles of CdS, Ni 9 S 8 and Al 2 O 3 in the photoreduction During the photoreduction of CO 2 , the CdS nanoparticles are responsible for the absorption of the visible light, as indicated by the UV-vis spectra (Fig. S4).The Ni 9 S 8 nanoparticles play as the cocatalysts providing the active sites for the photocatalytic reactions, as reflected by the low CO evolution on CdS/Al 2 O 3 (Fig. 3a) as well as the comparable CO evolution on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 to that on CdS/Pt/Al 2 O 3 .The much higher CO evolution on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 than that on CdS/ Ni 9 S 8 suggests that the Al 2 O 3 support plays an important role in the visible-light-driven photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O.For investigating the role of the Al 2 O 3 support, we studied the ability of the photocatalysts in separating the photogenerated electron-hole pairs, adsorbing CO 2 and producing protons from H 2 O splitting, which are the key factors affecting the photoreduction efficiency of CO 2 .Fig. 4a plots the PL spectra of CdS, CdS/Ni 9 S 8 and CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 . Fig. 5a plots the CO 2 adsorption capacity of CdS, Ni 9 S 8 , Al 2 O 3 , CdS/ Ni 9 S 8 , Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 and CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .The CO 2 adsorption capacity of CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 is 1.53 mmol g -1 , which is higher than those of CdS (0.12 mmol g -1 ), Ni 9 S 8 (0.49 mmol g -1 ) and Al 2 O 3 (1.15mmol g -1 ).The CO 2 adsorption capacity of CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 is about 2.5 and 1.1 times higher than those on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 (0.62 mmol g -1 ) and Ni 9 S 8 / Al 2 O 3 (1.40 mmol g -1 ), respectively.The interface and synergetic effect among different components may enhance the CO 2 adsorption on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .We have explored the O 1 s XPS spectrum of Ni 9 S 8 / Al 2 O 3 , as shown in Fig. S10 in the Supplementary Data.The XPS peaks at 530.9, 531.8, and 532.7 eV are attributed to the O 2-ion in the Al 2 O 3 structure (O a ), oxygen vacancies (O b ) and near-surface oxygen (O c ), respectively 38.The ratio of O b to the total oxygen species is 44 based on the calculation of O b /(O a O b O c Fig. 4.

(ii) Ex. with CO 2 , H 2 O and light, but without CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 ; (iii) Ex. with CdS/ Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 , light and H 2 O, but without CO 2 .No CO is generated in all of the Ex., implying that CO is from the visible-light-driven photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .Besides, an isotopic experiment with 454647minate, whereas on the FTIR spectra of Al 2 O 3 and CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 , the main bands are those assigned to the carbonate and bicarbonate species.As such, the presence of the Al 2 O 3 support triggers the formation of the carbonate and bicarbonate species from CO 2 adsorption.Previous DFT calculations demonstrated that, on the Al 2 O 3 -supported catalysts, the carbonate species are formed upon CO 2 adsorption, and then converted into bicarbonate species through protonation process in which the protons of the hydroxyl groups on the Al 2 O 3 support are transferred to one of the oxygen atoms of the carbonate species8,39,43,44.The carbonate and bicarbonate species have been shown to be the key intermediates for CO 2 conversion454647.Therefore, the formation of the carbonate and bicarbonate species resulted from the presence of the Al 2 O 3 support could be one of the reasons for the enhanced CO evolution on CdS/ Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 as compared with CdS/Ni 9 S 8 without the Al 2 O 3 support.Fig. 6 shows the activity of the photocatalysts for producing hydrogen in the visible-light-driven photocatalytic H 2 O splitting.There is no hydrogen evolution from Al 2 O 3 , CdS/Ni/Al 2 O 3 , Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 and CdS/NiO/Al 2 O 3 .Hydrogen was detected on CdS and CdS/Al 2 O 3 , but the evolution rates are only 3.6 and 5.4 mol h -1 , respectively.On CdS/Ni 9 S 8 , the hydrogen production is enhanced, with an evolution rate of 30.8 mol h -1 .As compared with CdS/Ni 9 S 8 , the hydrogen evolution rate on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 increases further, with a value of 84.1 mol h -1 .The quantum efficiency (QE) of CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 in hydrogen production is shown in Fig. (5)/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 hv h e -(1)h TEOA TEOA (2)H 2 O e - H OH -(3)OH - TEOA TEOA OH (4)CO 2 H e - CO OH(5) Acknowledgements This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos.21503062, U1662138, 21878203, and 21406153), Shanxi International Cooperation Project (No. 201703D421037), Shanxi Province Science Foundation for Youths (No. 201601D202019), Shanxi Provincial Key Innovative Research Team in Science and Technology (No. 2014131006), Scientific and Technological Innovation Programs of Higher Education Institutions in Shanxi (No. 2017137), and Program for the Outstanding Innovative Teams of Higher Learning Institutions of Shanxi (154010146-s).

For fabricating Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 , MIL-110 (Al) was firstly synthesized hydrothermally in the presence of trimethyl 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate (Me 3 btc) 21.MIL-110 (Al) is one of the metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) which are promising templates for forming catalysts via calcinations 222324.The porous structures of the catalysts prepared by using MOFs as the templates are similar to those of the MOF templates.This is benefit for achieving a high dispersion of the metal nanoparticles, even at a high metal content.The preparation of MIL-110 (Al) proceeded through the following steps.In the first step, 1.426 g of Al (NO 3 ) 3 9H 2 O (Tianjin Kermel Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd, AR, 99.0) was dissolved into 22 ml of deionized (DI) water.In the second step, 0.478 g of Me 3 btc was added into the solution obtained in the first step under vigorous stirring.In the third step, 2.2 ml of NaOH (4 M) was introduced to form a white emulsion, followed by adding HNO 3 (4 M) to adjust the pH value to about 3.9.After stirring for another 30 min, the mixture obtained in the third step was transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless steel at 200 C for 3 h.The sample obtained from the hydrothermal process was washed with DI water and further purified by dimethyl formamide (DMF, Tianjin Kermel Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd, AR, 99.5).The product was thoroughly washed with ethanol for several times to remove DMF and filtered, and dried at 80 C for 12 h, leading to the formation of the yellowish powdered MIL-110 (Al).Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Data shows the XRD and SEM results of MIL-110 (Al).The MIL-110 (Al) exhibits a rod-like morphology and a XRD pattern characteristic of MOF. Incipient wetness impregnation was used to load nickel precursor into MIL-110 (Al).Typically, 3.78 g of Ni(NO 3 ) 2 6H 2 O (Sinopharm chemical Reagent Co. Ltd., AR, 98.0) was dissolved in a DMF solution.5 g of MIL-110 (Al) was then impregnated with the Ni-contained DMF solution for 12 h.As-obtained sample was dried at 120 C for 12 h. The Ni-impregnated MIL-110 (Al) was next sulfured in a fixed-bed tubular reactor.In the first step of the sulfuration, the temperature of the reactor was increased to 350 C in N 2 with a flowing rate of 20 ml min -1 .And then, the N 2 was stopped, and H 2 containing dimethyl sulfide (CH 3 SCH 3 ) as the sulfur source was introduced into the reactor (15 ml min -1 ).A syringe pump was used to inject the CH 3 SCH 3 liquid into the H 2 stream (0.5 ml min -1 ).The sulfuration proceeded for 6 h. After sulfuration of 6 h, the temperature of the reactor was decreased to room temperature in N 2 (20 ml min -1 ), producing Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .For comparison, we also prepared Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 by using the thiophene, carbon disulfide and dimethyl disulfide as the sulfur sources through the process same as that by using the dimethyl sulfide. For comparison, NiO/Al 2 O 3 was prepared by calcining the Ni-impregnated MIL-110 (Al) in air at 400 C for 3 h, and Ni/Al 2 O 3 was fabricated by the same procedure as the sulfuration but only with hydrogen for reduction and without the addition of sulfide species. Loading of CdS nanoparticles on Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 , denoted as CdS/ Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 , was proceeded in 200 ml of aqueous solution containing 10 vol triethanoamine (TEOA) as the sacrificial reagent.Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 (160 mg) and CdS nanoparticles (40 mg) were added into the solution under ultrasonication for 2 h.The mixture was then divided into two parts.One part (100 mL) was centrifuged to collect the solid sample which was washed with ethanol and DI water for several times and subsequently dried in a vacuum freeze drier for further characterization.The other part (100 mL) was used for the visible-light-driven photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O. For preparing CdS/Pt, the CdS nanoparticles (20 mg) were dispersed in 1 ml of water solution of H 2 PtCl 6 6H 2 O, with a Pt content of 2.0 mg mL -1 , under ultrasonication for 30 min, depositing Pt ions onto the CdS nanoparticles.And then, the sample was irradiated for 1 h by using a 300 W Xe-lamp, reducing Pt ions into Pt 0 .Finally, the solid sample was harvested by centrifugation, washed with ethanol and DI water for several times, and dried under vacuum at 25 C for 12 h, fabricating CdS/Pt. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on an X' Pert Pro diffractometer equipped with Cu K radiation (scanning rate: 4m in -1 ).An ASAP 2020 analyzer (Micromeritics, Norcross, GA, USA) was used to explore the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas.UV-vis spectra were obtained on a UV-3101 Shimadzu spectrophotometer.The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out on an ESCALAB250Xi X-ray photoelectron spectrometer with a monochromatic X-ray source manufactured by Thermo.The binding energy was calibrated using the C 1 s peak (284.6 eV).Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations, including high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) and elemental mapping, were performed on a Philips TECNAI G 2 F30 system (beam energy: 200 kV).The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) measurements were conducted on a Bruker Tensor-27 spectrometer (resolution: 4 cm -1 ).A Fluoromax-3 spectrometer (Horiba Scientific) was used to collect the photoluminescence (PL) spectra.The inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) measurements were conducted on a Thermo X series 2 ICP-MS spectrometer.A Bruker EMXplus-10/12 spectrometer was applied for obtaining the electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra, with a microwave frequency of 9.64 GHz and a modulation amplitude of 2 G. 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO, 98.0;Sigma Chemical Co.) was used as the spin-trap reagent for the hydroxyl radicals. Transient photocurrents were measured on a CHI660 A electrochemical workstation in a Na 2 SO 4 solution (0.1 M) containing TEOA (10 vol ), by using a 300 W Xe-lamp equipped with a cut-off filter ( 420 nm), with a constant potential of 0.35 V vs. standard electrode (SCE).The solution and light source used for measuring the photocurrent are similar to those for the photocatalytic reactions.The workstation includes three electrodes.The working electrode, with a surface area of 1.44 cm 2 exposed to the electrolyte, was prepared by placing the sample on indium tin oxide (ITO) glasses.Pt and a saturated calomel electrode were used as the counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively.For preparing the working electrode, with a surface area of 1.44 cm 2 exposed to the electrolyte, 1 mg sample was firstly dispersed in 1 ml ethanol containing naphthol (0.05 wt) under ultrasonication.Then, the suspension was dropped onto ITO glasses, and dried at room temperature.The CO 2 adsorption capacities of the samples were examined on an ASAP 2020 analyzer (Micromeritics, Norcross, GA, USA), with pressures ranging from 0 to 1.01 bar, at 25 C.Before the adsorption experiments, the samples were degassed at 200 C for 12 h. The photoreduction was performed in a closed gas circulation-evacuation reactor, with H 2 O as the reductant, under the irradiation of visible light ( 420 nm).Before reaction, the following three steps were carried out.Firstly, 100 mg photocatalyst was dispersed in a H 2 O solution (100 mL) containing TEOA (10 vol) which serve as sacrificial reagents for capturing the photogenerated holes, in the reactor.And then, the reactor was evacuated and refilled with pure CO 2 gas for three times to remove the air inside.Finally, the reactor was filled with CO 2 until the pressure of the reactor reaching to the atmospheric pressure (101.325kPa).In the photocatalytic reduction, the reactor was irradiated with a Xe-lamp (300 W) equipped with a cut-off filter ( 420 nm) under stirring, and the temperature of the reactor was kept at 25 C by using cooling water.The products were detected by a gas chromatography (Agilent 7890 A) with both with Flame Ionization (FID) and Thermal Conductivity (TCD) detectors.The FID detector and an Agilent HPPLOT Q capillary column were used for analyzing methanol, while the TCD detector and a Porapak Q packed column were used for analyzing H 2 , O 2 , CO 2 , CO and CH 4 .Ar was used as the carrier gas.The GC was switched between the two columns by using a fourport valve.To determine the source of the carbon in the products, an isotopic experiment was carried out under the identical reaction conditions using 13 CO 2 (99.99 in purity), and the products were analyzed by a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Fig. 1a shows the XRD pattern of Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .On the XRD pattern, all of the peaks are attributed to the orthorhombic Ni 9 S 8 (PDF .There is no XRD peak assigned to Al 2 O 3 for Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 , indicating that the Al 2 O 3 support is amorphous.Fig. 1b andc 25,26.The XPS peak of S can be fitted into peaks at 161.3, 162.0, 162.7, 163.6, 166.3 and 168.2 eV, respectively (Fig. S2b).The peaks at 161.3 and 166.3 eV are assigned to the 2p 1/2 of S in Ni 9 S 8 , and the peaks at 162.0, 162.7 and 163.6 eV are due to the 2p 3/2 of S in Ni 9 S 8 252627.The peak at 168.2 eV is caused by the S in the SeO bonds 282930 S3) were fabricated via the hot-injection method which has been reported in detail elsewhere 313233.On the XRD pattern of CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 (Fig. 1a), besides the peaks of the orthorhombic Ni 9 S 8 , a peak at 26.5assigned to the (111) plane of the cubic CdS also appears (PDF80-0019). The performance of CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 and control samples in the visible-light-driven photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O were next explored by using the aqueous solution containing TEOA (10 vol) as a hole scavenger.The results are plotted in Fig. 3 and Fig. S5 in the Supplementary Data.During the experiments, CO is the main the product.In addition to CO, there is some methanol detected during the photocatalytic reactions, but the evolution rate of the methanol is lower than 0.1 mol h -1 .As reflected in Figs.3a andS5 Supplementary Data), an optimum CO evolution rate of 10. 13 CO 2 as the reactant was also done for determining the source of the carbon in CO.The m/z at 29 on the GC-MS spectrum is caused by 13 CO (Fig. S9 in the Supplementary Data), further revealing that CO is from the visible-light-driven photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .An evident peak at 490 nm, which is assigned to the recombination of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs, appears on the PL spectrum of CdS.This is in good agreement with the PL results reported previously for CdS 31323334.On CdS/Ni 9 S 8 and CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 , the PL peak at 490 nm is quenched significantly, implying an efficient electron-hole separation.The photocurrents of CdS, CdS/Ni 9 S 8 and CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 are illustrated in Fig. 4b.The photocurrent on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 is 0.42 mA cm -2 , which is much higher than those on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 (0.33 mA cm -2 ) and CdS (0.02 mA cm -2 ).Thus, on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 , the electron-hole recombination is efficiently suppressed, and more photogenerated electrons are transferred into the measuring circuit during the photocurrent experiments.The PL and photocurrent results indicate that the Al 2 O 3 support triggers more efficient electron-hole separation during the photocatalytic reaction.As reported previously, in photocatalysis, highly conductive supports, such as reduced graphene oxide and carbon nanotubes, can efficiently promote the separation of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs 18,353637.Our present results suggest that the Al 2 O 3 support, which has a poor conductivity, is also excellent in separating the photogenerated electronhole pairs.This could be originated from the defects and the hydroxyl groups on the Al 2 O 3 support.).The oxygen vacancies could also make some contributions to the enhanced CO 2 adsorption on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 39.As such, the Al 2 O 3 support triggers an improved CO 2 adsorption on the photocatalyst.Fig. 5b illustrates the dependence of the adsorption heat on the amount of CO 2 adsorbed, estimated by the Clausius-Clapeyron equation 404142.For all of the samples, the adsorption heat decreases with increasing CO 2 coverage, and the highest adsorption heat is obtained at the onset of CO 2 adsorption.For CdS, the highest adsorption heat is only 11.2 kJ mol -1 .With increasing the CO 2 adsorption coverage, the adsorption heat on CdS is close to zero.The low adsorption heat indicates that the CO 2 adsorption on CdS may be physical adsorption without any structural change occurring on the linear CO 2 molecule (OeCeO angle: 180) 8.The physical adsorption could be responsible for the low CO 2 adsorption capacity of CdS (Fig. 5a).The adsorption heats of Ni 9 S 8 and CdS/Ni 9 S 8 are similar, with the highest value of about 55.0 kJ mol -1 .The highest adsorption heat of CO 2 on Al 2 O 3 is 65.0 kJ mol -1 , which is in good agreement with the adsorption heat obtained from the density functional theory (DFT) calculations in our previous papers 39,43,44.The highest adsorption heat of CO 2 on -species, with a bent structure in which the OeCeO angle is about 140 39,43,44.The bands at 1230 and 1420 cm -1 are caused by the bidentate and monodentate carbonate species (CO 3 2-), respectively 8,39,43,44.The bands at 1535 and 1640 cm -1 are due to the bicarbonate species (HCO 3 -) formed from the protonation reaction between the carbonate species and the hydroxyl groups on the photocatalyst 8,39,43,44.On the FTIR spectrum of Ni 9 S 8 , the bands due to the CO 6b.With the wavelength increasing from 420 to 520 nm, the QE of CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 becomes higher firstly, and then decreases, with the highest QE (20.4) presents at 460 nm.The photocatalytic stability of CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 was examined in four consecutive runs with each run of 4 h, and there is nothing to do but evacuate the reactor between two runs.As shown in Fig. 6c, CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 has a good stability in hydrogen production.There is almost no decrease of the total amount of the hydrogen produced after four runs on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .These results show that the Al 2 O 3 support triggers an enhanced hydrogen production (proton production) from the visible-light-driven photocatalytic H 2 O splitting. PL, photocurrent, CO 2 adsorption and hydrogen production experiments suggest that, in the visible-light-driven photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O, the Al 2 O 3 support triggers enhanced separation of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs, CO 2 adsorption and production of hydrogen (or proton) for reducing CO 2 .This will definitely increase the amount of the electrons, CO 2 and hydrogen (or proton) participating in the photoreduction of CO 2 , thus leading to the enhanced CO evolution from the photoreduction of CO 2 on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 . Reactions possibly occurring during the visible-light-driven photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O to form CO on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 are listed as Eqs.( 1)-(9) (Eqs.( 1)-( 9)).Light absorption by CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 leads to the formation of the electron-hole pairs (Eq.( 1)).Capture of the photogenerated holes by the TEOA produces TEOA (Eq.( 2)).H 2 O can be split into an H atom and an OH -in the presence of the photogenerated electrons (Eq.( 3)).Reaction of OH -with TEOA results in an OH group and a TEOA molecule (Eq.( 4)).Reaction of CO 2 with the proton and photogenerated electron (Eq.( 5)), or/and with the H atom (Eq.( 6)), produces CO and an OH group.ESR experiments were conducted for studying the formation of the hydroxyl radicals by using DMPO as the radical probe.The evident DMPO-OH signals indicate the presence of the OH radicals (Fig. S11 in the Supplementary Data) 48.The protons (or H atoms) can combine together to form H 2 (Eqs.( 7) and ( 8)), and the OH groups can be converted into O 2 and H 2 O (Eqs.( 9)).During the conversion of CO 2 into CO through reactions 5 and 6, carbon and bicarbonate species could be the key intermediates.We analyzed the influence of the photoreduction on the photocatalyst by conducting XRD measurement.As shown in Fig. 1a, the XRD pattern of the photocatalyst after the photoreduction of 16 h is similar to that of the photocatalyst before the photoreduction.This indicates that there is almost no change on the properties of the photocatalyst. The Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalyst has been widely used in industry 495051.Sulfur poisoning, which can convert nickel into nickel sulfide, is one of the most serious problems negatively affecting the activity, selectivity and stability of the Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalyst 495051.Generally, the sulfurpoisoned Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalyst is discarded or regenerated through complex processes.Our present work indicates that the sulfur-poisoned Ni/ Al 2 O 3 catalyst could be excellent cocatalysts for the photoreduction of CO 2 .This opens a new way for the application of the sulfur-poisoned Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalyst. In conclusion, a highly efficient CO evolution, with an evolution rate of 12.1 mol h -1 , is achieved from the photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O on a noble-metal-free CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 photocatalyst, under the irradiation of visible light ( 420 nm) which is the main part of sunlight.The CO evolution rate on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 is comparable to that on the noble-metal-based CdS/Pt/Al 2 O 3 photocatalyst (10.6 mol h -1 ), but 11 times higher than that on the Al 2 O 3 -free CdS/ Ni 9 S 8 (1.1 mol h -1 ) photocatalyst.The Al 2 O 3 support triggers improved separation of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs, CO 2 adsorption and production of protons for reducing CO 2 .This is responsible for the enhanced CO evolution on the CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .These results are helpful for fabricating low-cost noble-metal-free photocatalysts for more efficient photoreduction of CO 2 . Fig.1ashows the XRD pattern of Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .On the XRD pattern, all of the peaks are attributed to the orthorhombic Ni 9 S 8 (PDF22- 1193).There is no XRD peak assigned to Al 2 O 3 for Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 , indicating that the Al 2 O 3 support is amorphous.Fig.1b and cillustrate the N 2 absorption-desorption curves and pore size distribution for Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .From the N 2 absorption-desorption experiment, the BET surface area of Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 is calculated to be 143 m 2 g -1 .The XPS spectra of the Ni and S on Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 are shown in Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Data.Six peaks at 853.1, 856.2, 861.4,870.3, 873.8 and 880.2 eV, respectively, are present on the XPS spectrum of Ni (Fig.S2a).The peaks at 853.1, 856.2 and 870.3 eV are attributed to the 2p 3/2 , 2p 3/2 and 2p 1/2 of Ni in Ni 9 S 8 , respectively252627.The peaks at 861.4, 873.8 and 880.2 eV are caused by the Ni in Ni-O bonds25,26.The XPS peak of S can be fitted into peaks at 161.3, 162.0, 162.7, 163.6, 166.3 and 168.2 eV, respectively (Fig.S2b).The peaks at 161.3 and 166.3 eV are assigned to the 2p 1/2 of S in Ni 9 S 8 , and the peaks at 162.0, 162.7 and 163.6 eV are due to the 2p 3/2 of S in Ni 9 S 8252627.The peak at 168.2 eV is caused by the S in the SeO bonds282930.The XPS results indicate that, besides the Ni-S bonds in Ni 9 S 8 , there are also Ni-O and SeO bonds on Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .The Ni-O and SeO bonds could be formed through the bonding interactions of the Ni and S atoms in Ni 9 S 8 with the O atoms on the Al 2 O 3 support, and could be the main drive to anchor Ni 9 S 8 on the Al 2 O 3 support.Fig. 2a and b illustrate the TEM images of Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .The Ni 9 S 8 nanoparticles are dispersed on the Al 2 O 3 support.The lattice fringes with distances of 0.183 and 0.237 nm are due to the (115) and (330) planes of the orthorhombic Ni 9 S 8 , respectively, indicating the presence of the orthorhombic Ni 9 S 8 on Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .This is in good agreement with the XRD and XPS results. CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 CdS nanoparticles with an average size of about 5 nm (Fig. S3 in the Supplementary Data) were next loaded on Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 to form the CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 photocatalyst.The CdS nanoparticles in the cubic phase of CdS (Fig. Fig. 2c-e show the HRTEM image and elemental mapping patterns for CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .The lattice fringe Fig. 1.(a) XRD patterns for Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 , CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 before reaction and CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 after reaction.(b) N 2 adsorption-desorption curves and (c) pore size distributions for Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 and CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .

Reaction conditions: 100 ml water solution containing 10 vol TEOA, 100 mg photocatalyst, 300 W Xe-lamp ( 420 nm). Roles of CdS, Ni 9 S 8 and Al 2 O 3 in the photoreduction During the photoreduction of CO 2 , the CdS nanoparticles are responsible for the absorption of the visible light, as indicated by the UV-vis spectra (Fig. S4).The Ni 9 S 8 nanoparticles play as the cocatalysts providing the active sites for the photocatalytic reactions, as reflected by the low CO evolution on CdS/Al 2 O 3 (Fig. 3a) as well as the comparable CO evolution on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 to that on CdS/Pt/Al 2 O 3 .The much higher CO evolution on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 than that on CdS/ Ni 9 S 8 suggests that the Al 2 O 3 support plays an important role in the visible-light-driven photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O.For investigating the role of the Al 2 O 3 support, we studied the ability of the photocatalysts in separating the photogenerated electron-hole pairs, adsorbing CO 2 and producing protons from H 2 O splitting, which are the key factors affecting the photoreduction efficiency of CO 2 .Fig. 4a plots the PL spectra of CdS, CdS/Ni 9 S 8 and CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 . Fig. 5a plots the CO 2 adsorption capacity of CdS, Ni 9 S 8 , Al 2 O 3 , CdS/ Ni 9 S 8 , Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 and CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .The CO 2 adsorption capacity of CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 is 1.53 mmol g -1 , which is higher than those of CdS (0.12 mmol g -1 ), Ni 9 S 8 (0.49 mmol g -1 ) and Al 2 O 3 (1.15mmol g -1 ).The CO 2 adsorption capacity of CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 is about 2.5 and 1.1 times higher than those on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 (0.62 mmol g -1 ) and Ni 9 S 8 / Al 2 O 3 (1.40 mmol g -1 ), respectively.The interface and synergetic effect among different components may enhance the CO 2 adsorption on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .We have explored the O 1 s XPS spectrum of Ni 9 S 8 / Al 2 O 3 , as shown in Fig. S10 in the Supplementary Data.The XPS peaks at 530.9, 531.8, and 532.7 eV are attributed to the O 2-ion in the Al 2 O 3 structure (O a ), oxygen vacancies (O b ) and near-surface oxygen (O c ), respectively 38.The ratio of O b to the total oxygen species is 44 based on the calculation of O b /(O a O b O c Fig. 4.

(ii) Ex. with CO 2 , H 2 O and light, but without CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 ; (iii) Ex. with CdS/ Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 , light and H 2 O, but without CO 2 .No CO is generated in all of the Ex., implying that CO is from the visible-light-driven photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .Besides, an isotopic experiment with 454647minate, whereas on the FTIR spectra of Al 2 O 3 and CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 , the main bands are those assigned to the carbonate and bicarbonate species.As such, the presence of the Al 2 O 3 support triggers the formation of the carbonate and bicarbonate species from CO 2 adsorption.Previous DFT calculations demonstrated that, on the Al 2 O 3 -supported catalysts, the carbonate species are formed upon CO 2 adsorption, and then converted into bicarbonate species through protonation process in which the protons of the hydroxyl groups on the Al 2 O 3 support are transferred to one of the oxygen atoms of the carbonate species8,39,43,44.The carbonate and bicarbonate species have been shown to be the key intermediates for CO 2 conversion454647.Therefore, the formation of the carbonate and bicarbonate species resulted from the presence of the Al 2 O 3 support could be one of the reasons for the enhanced CO evolution on CdS/ Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 as compared with CdS/Ni 9 S 8 without the Al 2 O 3 support.Fig. 6 shows the activity of the photocatalysts for producing hydrogen in the visible-light-driven photocatalytic H 2 O splitting.There is no hydrogen evolution from Al 2 O 3 , CdS/Ni/Al 2 O 3 , Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 and CdS/NiO/Al 2 O 3 .Hydrogen was detected on CdS and CdS/Al 2 O 3 , but the evolution rates are only 3.6 and 5.4 mol h -1 , respectively.On CdS/Ni 9 S 8 , the hydrogen production is enhanced, with an evolution rate of 30.8 mol h -1 .As compared with CdS/Ni 9 S 8 , the hydrogen evolution rate on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 increases further, with a value of 84.1 mol h -1 .The quantum efficiency (QE) of CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 in hydrogen production is shown in Fig. (5)/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 hv h e -(1)h TEOA TEOA (2)H 2 O e - H OH -(3)OH - TEOA TEOA OH (4)CO 2 H e - CO OH(5) Acknowledgements This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos.21503062, U1662138, 21878203, and 21406153), Shanxi International Cooperation Project (No. 201703D421037), Shanxi Province Science Foundation for Youths (No. 201601D202019), Shanxi Provincial Key Innovative Research Team in Science and Technology (No. 2014131006), Scientific and Technological Innovation Programs of Higher Education Institutions in Shanxi (No. 2017137), and Program for the Outstanding Innovative Teams of Higher Learning Institutions of Shanxi (154010146-s).

Roles of CdS, Ni 9 S 8 and Al 2 O 3 in the photoreduction During the photoreduction of CO 2 , the CdS nanoparticles are responsible for the absorption of the visible light, as indicated by the UV-vis spectra (Fig. S4).The Ni 9 S 8 nanoparticles play as the cocatalysts providing the active sites for the photocatalytic reactions, as reflected by the low CO evolution on CdS/Al 2 O 3 (Fig. 3a) as well as the comparable CO evolution on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 to that on CdS/Pt/Al 2 O 3 .The much higher CO evolution on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 than that on CdS/ Ni 9 S 8 suggests that the Al 2 O 3 support plays an important role in the visible-light-driven photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O.For investigating the role of the Al 2 O 3 support, we studied the ability of the photocatalysts in separating the photogenerated electron-hole pairs, adsorbing CO 2 and producing protons from H 2 O splitting, which are the key factors affecting the photoreduction efficiency of CO 2 .Fig. 4a plots the PL spectra of CdS, CdS/Ni 9 S 8 and CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .

(ii) Ex. with CO 2 , H 2 O and light, but without CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 ; (iii) Ex. with CdS/ Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 , light and H 2 O, but without CO 2 .No CO is generated in all of the Ex., implying that CO is from the visible-light-driven photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .Besides, an isotopic experiment with 454647minate, whereas on the FTIR spectra of Al 2 O 3 and CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 , the main bands are those assigned to the carbonate and bicarbonate species.As such, the presence of the Al 2 O 3 support triggers the formation of the carbonate and bicarbonate species from CO 2 adsorption.Previous DFT calculations demonstrated that, on the Al 2 O 3 -supported catalysts, the carbonate species are formed upon CO 2 adsorption, and then converted into bicarbonate species through protonation process in which the protons of the hydroxyl groups on the Al 2 O 3 support are transferred to one of the oxygen atoms of the carbonate species8,39,43,44.The carbonate and bicarbonate species have been shown to be the key intermediates for CO 2 conversion454647.Therefore, the formation of the carbonate and bicarbonate species resulted from the presence of the Al 2 O 3 support could be one of the reasons for the enhanced CO evolution on CdS/ Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 as compared with CdS/Ni 9 S 8 without the Al 2 O 3 support.Fig. 6 shows the activity of the photocatalysts for producing hydrogen in the visible-light-driven photocatalytic H 2 O splitting.There is no hydrogen evolution from Al 2 O 3 , CdS/Ni/Al 2 O 3 , Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 and CdS/NiO/Al 2 O 3 .Hydrogen was detected on CdS and CdS/Al 2 O 3 , but the evolution rates are only 3.6 and 5.4 mol h -1 , respectively.On CdS/Ni 9 S 8 , the hydrogen production is enhanced, with an evolution rate of 30.8 mol h -1 .As compared with CdS/Ni 9 S 8 , the hydrogen evolution rate on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 increases further, with a value of 84.1 mol h -1 .The quantum efficiency (QE) of CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 in hydrogen production is shown in Fig. (5)/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 hv h e -(1)h TEOA TEOA (2)H 2 O e - H OH -(3)OH - TEOA TEOA OH (4)CO 2 H e - CO OH(5) Acknowledgements This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos.21503062, U1662138, 21878203, and 21406153), Shanxi International Cooperation Project (No. 201703D421037), Shanxi Province Science Foundation for Youths (No. 201601D202019), Shanxi Provincial Key Innovative Research Team in Science and Technology (No. 2014131006), Scientific and Technological Innovation Programs of Higher Education Institutions in Shanxi (No. 2017137), and Program for the Outstanding Innovative Teams of Higher Learning Institutions of Shanxi (154010146-s).

For fabricating Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 , MIL-110 (Al) was firstly synthesized hydrothermally in the presence of trimethyl 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate (Me 3 btc) 21.MIL-110 (Al) is one of the metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) which are promising templates for forming catalysts via calcinations 222324.The porous structures of the catalysts prepared by using MOFs as the templates are similar to those of the MOF templates.This is benefit for achieving a high dispersion of the metal nanoparticles, even at a high metal content.The preparation of MIL-110 (Al) proceeded through the following steps.In the first step, 1.426 g of Al (NO 3 ) 3 9H 2 O (Tianjin Kermel Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd, AR, 99.0) was dissolved into 22 ml of deionized (DI) water.In the second step, 0.478 g of Me 3 btc was added into the solution obtained in the first step under vigorous stirring.In the third step, 2.2 ml of NaOH (4 M) was introduced to form a white emulsion, followed by adding HNO 3 (4 M) to adjust the pH value to about 3.9.After stirring for another 30 min, the mixture obtained in the third step was transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless steel at 200 C for 3 h.The sample obtained from the hydrothermal process was washed with DI water and further purified by dimethyl formamide (DMF, Tianjin Kermel Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd, AR, 99.5).The product was thoroughly washed with ethanol for several times to remove DMF and filtered, and dried at 80 C for 12 h, leading to the formation of the yellowish powdered MIL-110 (Al).Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Data shows the XRD and SEM results of MIL-110 (Al).The MIL-110 (Al) exhibits a rod-like morphology and a XRD pattern characteristic of MOF. Incipient wetness impregnation was used to load nickel precursor into MIL-110 (Al).Typically, 3.78 g of Ni(NO 3 ) 2 6H 2 O (Sinopharm chemical Reagent Co. Ltd., AR, 98.0) was dissolved in a DMF solution.5 g of MIL-110 (Al) was then impregnated with the Ni-contained DMF solution for 12 h.As-obtained sample was dried at 120 C for 12 h. The Ni-impregnated MIL-110 (Al) was next sulfured in a fixed-bed tubular reactor.In the first step of the sulfuration, the temperature of the reactor was increased to 350 C in N 2 with a flowing rate of 20 ml min -1 .And then, the N 2 was stopped, and H 2 containing dimethyl sulfide (CH 3 SCH 3 ) as the sulfur source was introduced into the reactor (15 ml min -1 ).A syringe pump was used to inject the CH 3 SCH 3 liquid into the H 2 stream (0.5 ml min -1 ).The sulfuration proceeded for 6 h. After sulfuration of 6 h, the temperature of the reactor was decreased to room temperature in N 2 (20 ml min -1 ), producing Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .For comparison, we also prepared Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 by using the thiophene, carbon disulfide and dimethyl disulfide as the sulfur sources through the process same as that by using the dimethyl sulfide. For comparison, NiO/Al 2 O 3 was prepared by calcining the Ni-impregnated MIL-110 (Al) in air at 400 C for 3 h, and Ni/Al 2 O 3 was fabricated by the same procedure as the sulfuration but only with hydrogen for reduction and without the addition of sulfide species. Loading of CdS nanoparticles on Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 , denoted as CdS/ Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 , was proceeded in 200 ml of aqueous solution containing 10 vol triethanoamine (TEOA) as the sacrificial reagent.Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 (160 mg) and CdS nanoparticles (40 mg) were added into the solution under ultrasonication for 2 h.The mixture was then divided into two parts.One part (100 mL) was centrifuged to collect the solid sample which was washed with ethanol and DI water for several times and subsequently dried in a vacuum freeze drier for further characterization.The other part (100 mL) was used for the visible-light-driven photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O. For preparing CdS/Pt, the CdS nanoparticles (20 mg) were dispersed in 1 ml of water solution of H 2 PtCl 6 6H 2 O, with a Pt content of 2.0 mg mL -1 , under ultrasonication for 30 min, depositing Pt ions onto the CdS nanoparticles.And then, the sample was irradiated for 1 h by using a 300 W Xe-lamp, reducing Pt ions into Pt 0 .Finally, the solid sample was harvested by centrifugation, washed with ethanol and DI water for several times, and dried under vacuum at 25 C for 12 h, fabricating CdS/Pt. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on an X' Pert Pro diffractometer equipped with Cu K radiation (scanning rate: 4m in -1 ).An ASAP 2020 analyzer (Micromeritics, Norcross, GA, USA) was used to explore the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas.UV-vis spectra were obtained on a UV-3101 Shimadzu spectrophotometer.The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out on an ESCALAB250Xi X-ray photoelectron spectrometer with a monochromatic X-ray source manufactured by Thermo.The binding energy was calibrated using the C 1 s peak (284.6 eV).Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations, including high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) and elemental mapping, were performed on a Philips TECNAI G 2 F30 system (beam energy: 200 kV).The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) measurements were conducted on a Bruker Tensor-27 spectrometer (resolution: 4 cm -1 ).A Fluoromax-3 spectrometer (Horiba Scientific) was used to collect the photoluminescence (PL) spectra.The inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) measurements were conducted on a Thermo X series 2 ICP-MS spectrometer.A Bruker EMXplus-10/12 spectrometer was applied for obtaining the electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra, with a microwave frequency of 9.64 GHz and a modulation amplitude of 2 G. 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO, 98.0;Sigma Chemical Co.) was used as the spin-trap reagent for the hydroxyl radicals. Transient photocurrents were measured on a CHI660 A electrochemical workstation in a Na 2 SO 4 solution (0.1 M) containing TEOA (10 vol ), by using a 300 W Xe-lamp equipped with a cut-off filter ( 420 nm), with a constant potential of 0.35 V vs. standard electrode (SCE).The solution and light source used for measuring the photocurrent are similar to those for the photocatalytic reactions.The workstation includes three electrodes.The working electrode, with a surface area of 1.44 cm 2 exposed to the electrolyte, was prepared by placing the sample on indium tin oxide (ITO) glasses.Pt and a saturated calomel electrode were used as the counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively.For preparing the working electrode, with a surface area of 1.44 cm 2 exposed to the electrolyte, 1 mg sample was firstly dispersed in 1 ml ethanol containing naphthol (0.05 wt) under ultrasonication.Then, the suspension was dropped onto ITO glasses, and dried at room temperature.The CO 2 adsorption capacities of the samples were examined on an ASAP 2020 analyzer (Micromeritics, Norcross, GA, USA), with pressures ranging from 0 to 1.01 bar, at 25 C.Before the adsorption experiments, the samples were degassed at 200 C for 12 h. The photoreduction was performed in a closed gas circulation-evacuation reactor, with H 2 O as the reductant, under the irradiation of visible light ( 420 nm).Before reaction, the following three steps were carried out.Firstly, 100 mg photocatalyst was dispersed in a H 2 O solution (100 mL) containing TEOA (10 vol) which serve as sacrificial reagents for capturing the photogenerated holes, in the reactor.And then, the reactor was evacuated and refilled with pure CO 2 gas for three times to remove the air inside.Finally, the reactor was filled with CO 2 until the pressure of the reactor reaching to the atmospheric pressure (101.325kPa).In the photocatalytic reduction, the reactor was irradiated with a Xe-lamp (300 W) equipped with a cut-off filter ( 420 nm) under stirring, and the temperature of the reactor was kept at 25 C by using cooling water.The products were detected by a gas chromatography (Agilent 7890 A) with both with Flame Ionization (FID) and Thermal Conductivity (TCD) detectors.The FID detector and an Agilent HPPLOT Q capillary column were used for analyzing methanol, while the TCD detector and a Porapak Q packed column were used for analyzing H 2 , O 2 , CO 2 , CO and CH 4 .Ar was used as the carrier gas.The GC was switched between the two columns by using a fourport valve.To determine the source of the carbon in the products, an isotopic experiment was carried out under the identical reaction conditions using 13 CO 2 (99.99 in purity), and the products were analyzed by a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Fig. 1a shows the XRD pattern of Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .On the XRD pattern, all of the peaks are attributed to the orthorhombic Ni 9 S 8 (PDF .There is no XRD peak assigned to Al 2 O 3 for Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 , indicating that the Al 2 O 3 support is amorphous.Fig. 1b andc 25,26.The XPS peak of S can be fitted into peaks at 161.3, 162.0, 162.7, 163.6, 166.3 and 168.2 eV, respectively (Fig. S2b).The peaks at 161.3 and 166.3 eV are assigned to the 2p 1/2 of S in Ni 9 S 8 , and the peaks at 162.0, 162.7 and 163.6 eV are due to the 2p 3/2 of S in Ni 9 S 8 252627.The peak at 168.2 eV is caused by the S in the SeO bonds 282930 S3) were fabricated via the hot-injection method which has been reported in detail elsewhere 313233.On the XRD pattern of CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 (Fig. 1a), besides the peaks of the orthorhombic Ni 9 S 8 , a peak at 26.5assigned to the (111) plane of the cubic CdS also appears (PDF80-0019). The performance of CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 and control samples in the visible-light-driven photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O were next explored by using the aqueous solution containing TEOA (10 vol) as a hole scavenger.The results are plotted in Fig. 3 and Fig. S5 in the Supplementary Data.During the experiments, CO is the main the product.In addition to CO, there is some methanol detected during the photocatalytic reactions, but the evolution rate of the methanol is lower than 0.1 mol h -1 .As reflected in Figs.3a andS5 Supplementary Data), an optimum CO evolution rate of 10. 13 CO 2 as the reactant was also done for determining the source of the carbon in CO.The m/z at 29 on the GC-MS spectrum is caused by 13 CO (Fig. S9 in the Supplementary Data), further revealing that CO is from the visible-light-driven photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .An evident peak at 490 nm, which is assigned to the recombination of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs, appears on the PL spectrum of CdS.This is in good agreement with the PL results reported previously for CdS 31323334.On CdS/Ni 9 S 8 and CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 , the PL peak at 490 nm is quenched significantly, implying an efficient electron-hole separation.The photocurrents of CdS, CdS/Ni 9 S 8 and CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 are illustrated in Fig. 4b.The photocurrent on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 is 0.42 mA cm -2 , which is much higher than those on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 (0.33 mA cm -2 ) and CdS (0.02 mA cm -2 ).Thus, on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 , the electron-hole recombination is efficiently suppressed, and more photogenerated electrons are transferred into the measuring circuit during the photocurrent experiments.The PL and photocurrent results indicate that the Al 2 O 3 support triggers more efficient electron-hole separation during the photocatalytic reaction.As reported previously, in photocatalysis, highly conductive supports, such as reduced graphene oxide and carbon nanotubes, can efficiently promote the separation of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs 18,353637.Our present results suggest that the Al 2 O 3 support, which has a poor conductivity, is also excellent in separating the photogenerated electronhole pairs.This could be originated from the defects and the hydroxyl groups on the Al 2 O 3 support.).The oxygen vacancies could also make some contributions to the enhanced CO 2 adsorption on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 39.As such, the Al 2 O 3 support triggers an improved CO 2 adsorption on the photocatalyst.Fig. 5b illustrates the dependence of the adsorption heat on the amount of CO 2 adsorbed, estimated by the Clausius-Clapeyron equation 404142.For all of the samples, the adsorption heat decreases with increasing CO 2 coverage, and the highest adsorption heat is obtained at the onset of CO 2 adsorption.For CdS, the highest adsorption heat is only 11.2 kJ mol -1 .With increasing the CO 2 adsorption coverage, the adsorption heat on CdS is close to zero.The low adsorption heat indicates that the CO 2 adsorption on CdS may be physical adsorption without any structural change occurring on the linear CO 2 molecule (OeCeO angle: 180) 8.The physical adsorption could be responsible for the low CO 2 adsorption capacity of CdS (Fig. 5a).The adsorption heats of Ni 9 S 8 and CdS/Ni 9 S 8 are similar, with the highest value of about 55.0 kJ mol -1 .The highest adsorption heat of CO 2 on Al 2 O 3 is 65.0 kJ mol -1 , which is in good agreement with the adsorption heat obtained from the density functional theory (DFT) calculations in our previous papers 39,43,44.The highest adsorption heat of CO 2 on -species, with a bent structure in which the OeCeO angle is about 140 39,43,44.The bands at 1230 and 1420 cm -1 are caused by the bidentate and monodentate carbonate species (CO 3 2-), respectively 8,39,43,44.The bands at 1535 and 1640 cm -1 are due to the bicarbonate species (HCO 3 -) formed from the protonation reaction between the carbonate species and the hydroxyl groups on the photocatalyst 8,39,43,44.On the FTIR spectrum of Ni 9 S 8 , the bands due to the CO 6b.With the wavelength increasing from 420 to 520 nm, the QE of CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 becomes higher firstly, and then decreases, with the highest QE (20.4) presents at 460 nm.The photocatalytic stability of CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 was examined in four consecutive runs with each run of 4 h, and there is nothing to do but evacuate the reactor between two runs.As shown in Fig. 6c, CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 has a good stability in hydrogen production.There is almost no decrease of the total amount of the hydrogen produced after four runs on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .These results show that the Al 2 O 3 support triggers an enhanced hydrogen production (proton production) from the visible-light-driven photocatalytic H 2 O splitting. PL, photocurrent, CO 2 adsorption and hydrogen production experiments suggest that, in the visible-light-driven photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O, the Al 2 O 3 support triggers enhanced separation of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs, CO 2 adsorption and production of hydrogen (or proton) for reducing CO 2 .This will definitely increase the amount of the electrons, CO 2 and hydrogen (or proton) participating in the photoreduction of CO 2 , thus leading to the enhanced CO evolution from the photoreduction of CO 2 on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 . Reactions possibly occurring during the visible-light-driven photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O to form CO on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 are listed as Eqs.( 1)-(9) (Eqs.( 1)-( 9)).Light absorption by CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 leads to the formation of the electron-hole pairs (Eq.( 1)).Capture of the photogenerated holes by the TEOA produces TEOA (Eq.( 2)).H 2 O can be split into an H atom and an OH -in the presence of the photogenerated electrons (Eq.( 3)).Reaction of OH -with TEOA results in an OH group and a TEOA molecule (Eq.( 4)).Reaction of CO 2 with the proton and photogenerated electron (Eq.( 5)), or/and with the H atom (Eq.( 6)), produces CO and an OH group.ESR experiments were conducted for studying the formation of the hydroxyl radicals by using DMPO as the radical probe.The evident DMPO-OH signals indicate the presence of the OH radicals (Fig. S11 in the Supplementary Data) 48.The protons (or H atoms) can combine together to form H 2 (Eqs.( 7) and ( 8)), and the OH groups can be converted into O 2 and H 2 O (Eqs.( 9)).During the conversion of CO 2 into CO through reactions 5 and 6, carbon and bicarbonate species could be the key intermediates.We analyzed the influence of the photoreduction on the photocatalyst by conducting XRD measurement.As shown in Fig. 1a, the XRD pattern of the photocatalyst after the photoreduction of 16 h is similar to that of the photocatalyst before the photoreduction.This indicates that there is almost no change on the properties of the photocatalyst. The Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalyst has been widely used in industry 495051.Sulfur poisoning, which can convert nickel into nickel sulfide, is one of the most serious problems negatively affecting the activity, selectivity and stability of the Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalyst 495051.Generally, the sulfurpoisoned Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalyst is discarded or regenerated through complex processes.Our present work indicates that the sulfur-poisoned Ni/ Al 2 O 3 catalyst could be excellent cocatalysts for the photoreduction of CO 2 .This opens a new way for the application of the sulfur-poisoned Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalyst. In conclusion, a highly efficient CO evolution, with an evolution rate of 12.1 mol h -1 , is achieved from the photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O on a noble-metal-free CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 photocatalyst, under the irradiation of visible light ( 420 nm) which is the main part of sunlight.The CO evolution rate on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 is comparable to that on the noble-metal-based CdS/Pt/Al 2 O 3 photocatalyst (10.6 mol h -1 ), but 11 times higher than that on the Al 2 O 3 -free CdS/ Ni 9 S 8 (1.1 mol h -1 ) photocatalyst.The Al 2 O 3 support triggers improved separation of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs, CO 2 adsorption and production of protons for reducing CO 2 .This is responsible for the enhanced CO evolution on the CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .These results are helpful for fabricating low-cost noble-metal-free photocatalysts for more efficient photoreduction of CO 2 . Fig.1ashows the XRD pattern of Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .On the XRD pattern, all of the peaks are attributed to the orthorhombic Ni 9 S 8 (PDF22- 1193).There is no XRD peak assigned to Al 2 O 3 for Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 , indicating that the Al 2 O 3 support is amorphous.Fig.1b and cillustrate the N 2 absorption-desorption curves and pore size distribution for Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .From the N 2 absorption-desorption experiment, the BET surface area of Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 is calculated to be 143 m 2 g -1 .The XPS spectra of the Ni and S on Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 are shown in Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Data.Six peaks at 853.1, 856.2, 861.4,870.3, 873.8 and 880.2 eV, respectively, are present on the XPS spectrum of Ni (Fig.S2a).The peaks at 853.1, 856.2 and 870.3 eV are attributed to the 2p 3/2 , 2p 3/2 and 2p 1/2 of Ni in Ni 9 S 8 , respectively252627.The peaks at 861.4, 873.8 and 880.2 eV are caused by the Ni in Ni-O bonds25,26.The XPS peak of S can be fitted into peaks at 161.3, 162.0, 162.7, 163.6, 166.3 and 168.2 eV, respectively (Fig.S2b).The peaks at 161.3 and 166.3 eV are assigned to the 2p 1/2 of S in Ni 9 S 8 , and the peaks at 162.0, 162.7 and 163.6 eV are due to the 2p 3/2 of S in Ni 9 S 8252627.The peak at 168.2 eV is caused by the S in the SeO bonds282930.The XPS results indicate that, besides the Ni-S bonds in Ni 9 S 8 , there are also Ni-O and SeO bonds on Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .The Ni-O and SeO bonds could be formed through the bonding interactions of the Ni and S atoms in Ni 9 S 8 with the O atoms on the Al 2 O 3 support, and could be the main drive to anchor Ni 9 S 8 on the Al 2 O 3 support.Fig. 2a and b illustrate the TEM images of Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .The Ni 9 S 8 nanoparticles are dispersed on the Al 2 O 3 support.The lattice fringes with distances of 0.183 and 0.237 nm are due to the (115) and (330) planes of the orthorhombic Ni 9 S 8 , respectively, indicating the presence of the orthorhombic Ni 9 S 8 on Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .This is in good agreement with the XRD and XPS results. CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 CdS nanoparticles with an average size of about 5 nm (Fig. S3 in the Supplementary Data) were next loaded on Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 to form the CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 photocatalyst.The CdS nanoparticles in the cubic phase of CdS (Fig. Fig. 2c-e show the HRTEM image and elemental mapping patterns for CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .The lattice fringe Fig. 1.(a) XRD patterns for Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 , CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 before reaction and CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 after reaction.(b) N 2 adsorption-desorption curves and (c) pore size distributions for Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 and CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .

Reaction conditions: 100 ml water solution containing 10 vol TEOA, 100 mg photocatalyst, 300 W Xe-lamp ( 420 nm). Roles of CdS, Ni 9 S 8 and Al 2 O 3 in the photoreduction During the photoreduction of CO 2 , the CdS nanoparticles are responsible for the absorption of the visible light, as indicated by the UV-vis spectra (Fig. S4).The Ni 9 S 8 nanoparticles play as the cocatalysts providing the active sites for the photocatalytic reactions, as reflected by the low CO evolution on CdS/Al 2 O 3 (Fig. 3a) as well as the comparable CO evolution on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 to that on CdS/Pt/Al 2 O 3 .The much higher CO evolution on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 than that on CdS/ Ni 9 S 8 suggests that the Al 2 O 3 support plays an important role in the visible-light-driven photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O.For investigating the role of the Al 2 O 3 support, we studied the ability of the photocatalysts in separating the photogenerated electron-hole pairs, adsorbing CO 2 and producing protons from H 2 O splitting, which are the key factors affecting the photoreduction efficiency of CO 2 .Fig. 4a plots the PL spectra of CdS, CdS/Ni 9 S 8 and CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 . Fig. 5a plots the CO 2 adsorption capacity of CdS, Ni 9 S 8 , Al 2 O 3 , CdS/ Ni 9 S 8 , Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 and CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .The CO 2 adsorption capacity of CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 is 1.53 mmol g -1 , which is higher than those of CdS (0.12 mmol g -1 ), Ni 9 S 8 (0.49 mmol g -1 ) and Al 2 O 3 (1.15mmol g -1 ).The CO 2 adsorption capacity of CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 is about 2.5 and 1.1 times higher than those on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 (0.62 mmol g -1 ) and Ni 9 S 8 / Al 2 O 3 (1.40 mmol g -1 ), respectively.The interface and synergetic effect among different components may enhance the CO 2 adsorption on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .We have explored the O 1 s XPS spectrum of Ni 9 S 8 / Al 2 O 3 , as shown in Fig. S10 in the Supplementary Data.The XPS peaks at 530.9, 531.8, and 532.7 eV are attributed to the O 2-ion in the Al 2 O 3 structure (O a ), oxygen vacancies (O b ) and near-surface oxygen (O c ), respectively 38.The ratio of O b to the total oxygen species is 44 based on the calculation of O b /(O a O b O c Fig. 4.

(ii) Ex. with CO 2 , H 2 O and light, but without CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 ; (iii) Ex. with CdS/ Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 , light and H 2 O, but without CO 2 .No CO is generated in all of the Ex., implying that CO is from the visible-light-driven photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .Besides, an isotopic experiment with 454647minate, whereas on the FTIR spectra of Al 2 O 3 and CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 , the main bands are those assigned to the carbonate and bicarbonate species.As such, the presence of the Al 2 O 3 support triggers the formation of the carbonate and bicarbonate species from CO 2 adsorption.Previous DFT calculations demonstrated that, on the Al 2 O 3 -supported catalysts, the carbonate species are formed upon CO 2 adsorption, and then converted into bicarbonate species through protonation process in which the protons of the hydroxyl groups on the Al 2 O 3 support are transferred to one of the oxygen atoms of the carbonate species8,39,43,44.The carbonate and bicarbonate species have been shown to be the key intermediates for CO 2 conversion454647.Therefore, the formation of the carbonate and bicarbonate species resulted from the presence of the Al 2 O 3 support could be one of the reasons for the enhanced CO evolution on CdS/ Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 as compared with CdS/Ni 9 S 8 without the Al 2 O 3 support.Fig. 6 shows the activity of the photocatalysts for producing hydrogen in the visible-light-driven photocatalytic H 2 O splitting.There is no hydrogen evolution from Al 2 O 3 , CdS/Ni/Al 2 O 3 , Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 and CdS/NiO/Al 2 O 3 .Hydrogen was detected on CdS and CdS/Al 2 O 3 , but the evolution rates are only 3.6 and 5.4 mol h -1 , respectively.On CdS/Ni 9 S 8 , the hydrogen production is enhanced, with an evolution rate of 30.8 mol h -1 .As compared with CdS/Ni 9 S 8 , the hydrogen evolution rate on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 increases further, with a value of 84.1 mol h -1 .The quantum efficiency (QE) of CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 in hydrogen production is shown in Fig. (5)/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 hv h e -(1)h TEOA TEOA (2)H 2 O e - H OH -(3)OH - TEOA TEOA OH (4)CO 2 H e - CO OH(5) Acknowledgements This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos.21503062, U1662138, 21878203, and 21406153), Shanxi International Cooperation Project (No. 201703D421037), Shanxi Province Science Foundation for Youths (No. 201601D202019), Shanxi Provincial Key Innovative Research Team in Science and Technology (No. 2014131006), Scientific and Technological Innovation Programs of Higher Education Institutions in Shanxi (No. 2017137), and Program for the Outstanding Innovative Teams of Higher Learning Institutions of Shanxi (154010146-s).

The performance of CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 and control samples in the visible-light-driven photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O were next explored by using the aqueous solution containing TEOA (10 vol) as a hole scavenger.The results are plotted in Fig. 3 and Fig. S5 in the Supplementary Data.During the experiments, CO is the main the product.In addition to CO, there is some methanol detected during the photocatalytic reactions, but the evolution rate of the methanol is lower than 0.1 mol h -1 .As reflected in Figs.3a andS5 Supplementary Data), an optimum CO evolution rate of 10. 13 CO 2 as the reactant was also done for determining the source of the carbon in CO.The m/z at 29 on the GC-MS spectrum is caused by 13 CO (Fig. S9 in the Supplementary Data), further revealing that CO is from the visible-light-driven photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .An evident peak at 490 nm, which is assigned to the recombination of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs, appears on the PL spectrum of CdS.This is in good agreement with the PL results reported previously for CdS 31323334.On CdS/Ni 9 S 8 and CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 , the PL peak at 490 nm is quenched significantly, implying an efficient electron-hole separation.The photocurrents of CdS, CdS/Ni 9 S 8 and CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 are illustrated in Fig. 4b.The photocurrent on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 is 0.42 mA cm -2 , which is much higher than those on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 (0.33 mA cm -2 ) and CdS (0.02 mA cm -2 ).Thus, on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 , the electron-hole recombination is efficiently suppressed, and more photogenerated electrons are transferred into the measuring circuit during the photocurrent experiments.The PL and photocurrent results indicate that the Al 2 O 3 support triggers more efficient electron-hole separation during the photocatalytic reaction.As reported previously, in photocatalysis, highly conductive supports, such as reduced graphene oxide and carbon nanotubes, can efficiently promote the separation of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs 18,353637.Our present results suggest that the Al 2 O 3 support, which has a poor conductivity, is also excellent in separating the photogenerated electronhole pairs.This could be originated from the defects and the hydroxyl groups on the Al 2 O 3 support.).The oxygen vacancies could also make some contributions to the enhanced CO 2 adsorption on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 39.As such, the Al 2 O 3 support triggers an improved CO 2 adsorption on the photocatalyst.Fig. 5b illustrates the dependence of the adsorption heat on the amount of CO 2 adsorbed, estimated by the Clausius-Clapeyron equation 404142.For all of the samples, the adsorption heat decreases with increasing CO 2 coverage, and the highest adsorption heat is obtained at the onset of CO 2 adsorption.For CdS, the highest adsorption heat is only 11.2 kJ mol -1 .With increasing the CO 2 adsorption coverage, the adsorption heat on CdS is close to zero.The low adsorption heat indicates that the CO 2 adsorption on CdS may be physical adsorption without any structural change occurring on the linear CO 2 molecule (OeCeO angle: 180) 8.The physical adsorption could be responsible for the low CO 2 adsorption capacity of CdS (Fig. 5a).The adsorption heats of Ni 9 S 8 and CdS/Ni 9 S 8 are similar, with the highest value of about 55.0 kJ mol -1 .The highest adsorption heat of CO 2 on Al 2 O 3 is 65.0 kJ mol -1 , which is in good agreement with the adsorption heat obtained from the density functional theory (DFT) calculations in our previous papers 39,43,44.The highest adsorption heat of CO 2 on -species, with a bent structure in which the OeCeO angle is about 140 39,43,44.The bands at 1230 and 1420 cm -1 are caused by the bidentate and monodentate carbonate species (CO 3 2-), respectively 8,39,43,44.The bands at 1535 and 1640 cm -1 are due to the bicarbonate species (HCO 3 -) formed from the protonation reaction between the carbonate species and the hydroxyl groups on the photocatalyst 8,39,43,44.On the FTIR spectrum of Ni 9 S 8 , the bands due to the CO 6b.With the wavelength increasing from 420 to 520 nm, the QE of CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 becomes higher firstly, and then decreases, with the highest QE (20.4) presents at 460 nm.The photocatalytic stability of CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 was examined in four consecutive runs with each run of 4 h, and there is nothing to do but evacuate the reactor between two runs.As shown in Fig. 6c, CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 has a good stability in hydrogen production.There is almost no decrease of the total amount of the hydrogen produced after four runs on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .These results show that the Al 2 O 3 support triggers an enhanced hydrogen production (proton production) from the visible-light-driven photocatalytic H 2 O splitting. PL, photocurrent, CO 2 adsorption and hydrogen production experiments suggest that, in the visible-light-driven photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O, the Al 2 O 3 support triggers enhanced separation of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs, CO 2 adsorption and production of hydrogen (or proton) for reducing CO 2 .This will definitely increase the amount of the electrons, CO 2 and hydrogen (or proton) participating in the photoreduction of CO 2 , thus leading to the enhanced CO evolution from the photoreduction of CO 2 on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 . Reactions possibly occurring during the visible-light-driven photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O to form CO on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 are listed as Eqs.( 1)-(9) (Eqs.( 1)-( 9)).Light absorption by CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 leads to the formation of the electron-hole pairs (Eq.( 1)).Capture of the photogenerated holes by the TEOA produces TEOA (Eq.( 2)).H 2 O can be split into an H atom and an OH -in the presence of the photogenerated electrons (Eq.( 3)).Reaction of OH -with TEOA results in an OH group and a TEOA molecule (Eq.( 4)).Reaction of CO 2 with the proton and photogenerated electron (Eq.( 5)), or/and with the H atom (Eq.( 6)), produces CO and an OH group.ESR experiments were conducted for studying the formation of the hydroxyl radicals by using DMPO as the radical probe.The evident DMPO-OH signals indicate the presence of the OH radicals (Fig. S11 in the Supplementary Data) 48.The protons (or H atoms) can combine together to form H 2 (Eqs.( 7) and ( 8)), and the OH groups can be converted into O 2 and H 2 O (Eqs.( 9)).During the conversion of CO 2 into CO through reactions 5 and 6, carbon and bicarbonate species could be the key intermediates.We analyzed the influence of the photoreduction on the photocatalyst by conducting XRD measurement.As shown in Fig. 1a, the XRD pattern of the photocatalyst after the photoreduction of 16 h is similar to that of the photocatalyst before the photoreduction.This indicates that there is almost no change on the properties of the photocatalyst. The Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalyst has been widely used in industry 495051.Sulfur poisoning, which can convert nickel into nickel sulfide, is one of the most serious problems negatively affecting the activity, selectivity and stability of the Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalyst 495051.Generally, the sulfurpoisoned Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalyst is discarded or regenerated through complex processes.Our present work indicates that the sulfur-poisoned Ni/ Al 2 O 3 catalyst could be excellent cocatalysts for the photoreduction of CO 2 .This opens a new way for the application of the sulfur-poisoned Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalyst."}, {"llm generation": "Liquid", "source": "Reaction conditions: 100 ml water solution containing 10 vol TEOA, 100 mg photocatalyst, 300 W Xe-lamp ( 420 nm).", "context": "In conclusion, a highly efficient CO evolution, with an evolution rate of 12.1 mol h -1 , is achieved from the photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O on a noble-metal-free CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 photocatalyst, under the irradiation of visible light ( 420 nm) which is the main part of sunlight.The CO evolution rate on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 is comparable to that on the noble-metal-based CdS/Pt/Al 2 O 3 photocatalyst (10.6 mol h -1 ), but 11 times higher than that on the Al 2 O 3 -free CdS/ Ni 9 S 8 (1.1 mol h -1 ) photocatalyst.The Al 2 O 3 support triggers improved separation of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs, CO 2 adsorption and production of protons for reducing CO 2 .This is responsible for the enhanced CO evolution on the CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .These results are helpful for fabricating low-cost noble-metal-free photocatalysts for more efficient photoreduction of CO 2 . Fig.1ashows the XRD pattern of Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .On the XRD pattern, all of the peaks are attributed to the orthorhombic Ni 9 S 8 (PDF22- 1193).There is no XRD peak assigned to Al 2 O 3 for Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 , indicating that the Al 2 O 3 support is amorphous.Fig.1b and cillustrate the N 2 absorption-desorption curves and pore size distribution for Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .From the N 2 absorption-desorption experiment, the BET surface area of Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 is calculated to be 143 m 2 g -1 .The XPS spectra of the Ni and S on Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 are shown in Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Data.Six peaks at 853.1, 856.2, 861.4,870.3, 873.8 and 880.2 eV, respectively, are present on the XPS spectrum of Ni (Fig.S2a).The peaks at 853.1, 856.2 and 870.3 eV are attributed to the 2p 3/2 , 2p 3/2 and 2p 1/2 of Ni in Ni 9 S 8 , respectively252627.The peaks at 861.4, 873.8 and 880.2 eV are caused by the Ni in Ni-O bonds25,26.The XPS peak of S can be fitted into peaks at 161.3, 162.0, 162.7, 163.6, 166.3 and 168.2 eV, respectively (Fig.S2b).The peaks at 161.3 and 166.3 eV are assigned to the 2p 1/2 of S in Ni 9 S 8 , and the peaks at 162.0, 162.7 and 163.6 eV are due to the 2p 3/2 of S in Ni 9 S 8252627.The peak at 168.2 eV is caused by the S in the SeO bonds282930.The XPS results indicate that, besides the Ni-S bonds in Ni 9 S 8 , there are also Ni-O and SeO bonds on Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .The Ni-O and SeO bonds could be formed through the bonding interactions of the Ni and S atoms in Ni 9 S 8 with the O atoms on the Al 2 O 3 support, and could be the main drive to anchor Ni 9 S 8 on the Al 2 O 3 support.Fig. 2a and b illustrate the TEM images of Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .The Ni 9 S 8 nanoparticles are dispersed on the Al 2 O 3 support.The lattice fringes with distances of 0.183 and 0.237 nm are due to the (115) and (330) planes of the orthorhombic Ni 9 S 8 , respectively, indicating the presence of the orthorhombic Ni 9 S 8 on Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .This is in good agreement with the XRD and XPS results. CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 CdS nanoparticles with an average size of about 5 nm (Fig. S3 in the Supplementary Data) were next loaded on Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 to form the CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 photocatalyst.The CdS nanoparticles in the cubic phase of CdS (Fig. Fig. 2c-e show the HRTEM image and elemental mapping patterns for CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .The lattice fringe Fig. 1.(a) XRD patterns for Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 , CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 before reaction and CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 after reaction.(b) N 2 adsorption-desorption curves and (c) pore size distributions for Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 and CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .

Roles of CdS, Ni 9 S 8 and Al 2 O 3 in the photoreduction During the photoreduction of CO 2 , the CdS nanoparticles are responsible for the absorption of the visible light, as indicated by the UV-vis spectra (Fig. S4).The Ni 9 S 8 nanoparticles play as the cocatalysts providing the active sites for the photocatalytic reactions, as reflected by the low CO evolution on CdS/Al 2 O 3 (Fig. 3a) as well as the comparable CO evolution on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 to that on CdS/Pt/Al 2 O 3 .The much higher CO evolution on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 than that on CdS/ Ni 9 S 8 suggests that the Al 2 O 3 support plays an important role in the visible-light-driven photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O.For investigating the role of the Al 2 O 3 support, we studied the ability of the photocatalysts in separating the photogenerated electron-hole pairs, adsorbing CO 2 and producing protons from H 2 O splitting, which are the key factors affecting the photoreduction efficiency of CO 2 .Fig. 4a plots the PL spectra of CdS, CdS/Ni 9 S 8 and CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 . Fig. 5a plots the CO 2 adsorption capacity of CdS, Ni 9 S 8 , Al 2 O 3 , CdS/ Ni 9 S 8 , Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 and CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .The CO 2 adsorption capacity of CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 is 1.53 mmol g -1 , which is higher than those of CdS (0.12 mmol g -1 ), Ni 9 S 8 (0.49 mmol g -1 ) and Al 2 O 3 (1.15mmol g -1 ).The CO 2 adsorption capacity of CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 is about 2.5 and 1.1 times higher than those on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 (0.62 mmol g -1 ) and Ni 9 S 8 / Al 2 O 3 (1.40 mmol g -1 ), respectively.The interface and synergetic effect among different components may enhance the CO 2 adsorption on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .We have explored the O 1 s XPS spectrum of Ni 9 S 8 / Al 2 O 3 , as shown in Fig. S10 in the Supplementary Data.The XPS peaks at 530.9, 531.8, and 532.7 eV are attributed to the O 2-ion in the Al 2 O 3 structure (O a ), oxygen vacancies (O b ) and near-surface oxygen (O c ), respectively 38.The ratio of O b to the total oxygen species is 44 based on the calculation of O b /(O a O b O c Fig. 4.

(ii) Ex. with CO 2 , H 2 O and light, but without CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 ; (iii) Ex. with CdS/ Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 , light and H 2 O, but without CO 2 .No CO is generated in all of the Ex., implying that CO is from the visible-light-driven photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 .Besides, an isotopic experiment with 454647minate, whereas on the FTIR spectra of Al 2 O 3 and CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 , the main bands are those assigned to the carbonate and bicarbonate species.As such, the presence of the Al 2 O 3 support triggers the formation of the carbonate and bicarbonate species from CO 2 adsorption.Previous DFT calculations demonstrated that, on the Al 2 O 3 -supported catalysts, the carbonate species are formed upon CO 2 adsorption, and then converted into bicarbonate species through protonation process in which the protons of the hydroxyl groups on the Al 2 O 3 support are transferred to one of the oxygen atoms of the carbonate species8,39,43,44.The carbonate and bicarbonate species have been shown to be the key intermediates for CO 2 conversion454647.Therefore, the formation of the carbonate and bicarbonate species resulted from the presence of the Al 2 O 3 support could be one of the reasons for the enhanced CO evolution on CdS/ Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 as compared with CdS/Ni 9 S 8 without the Al 2 O 3 support.Fig. 6 shows the activity of the photocatalysts for producing hydrogen in the visible-light-driven photocatalytic H 2 O splitting.There is no hydrogen evolution from Al 2 O 3 , CdS/Ni/Al 2 O 3 , Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 and CdS/NiO/Al 2 O 3 .Hydrogen was detected on CdS and CdS/Al 2 O 3 , but the evolution rates are only 3.6 and 5.4 mol h -1 , respectively.On CdS/Ni 9 S 8 , the hydrogen production is enhanced, with an evolution rate of 30.8 mol h -1 .As compared with CdS/Ni 9 S 8 , the hydrogen evolution rate on CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 increases further, with a value of 84.1 mol h -1 .The quantum efficiency (QE) of CdS/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 in hydrogen production is shown in Fig. (5)/Ni 9 S 8 /Al 2 O 3 hv h e -(1)h TEOA TEOA (2)H 2 O e - H OH -(3)OH - TEOA TEOA OH (4)CO 2 H e - CO OH(5) Acknowledgements This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos.21503062, U1662138, 21878203, and 21406153), Shanxi International Cooperation Project (No. 201703D421037), Shanxi Province Science Foundation for Youths (No. 201601D202019), Shanxi Provincial Key Innovative Research Team in Science and Technology (No. 2014131006), Scientific and Technological Innovation Programs of Higher Education Institutions in Shanxi (No. 2017137), and Program for the Outstanding Innovative Teams of Higher Learning Institutions of Shanxi (154010146-s).
