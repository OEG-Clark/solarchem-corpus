X-Ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected at a scan rate of 2 min -1 on a Rigaku D/Max 2200PC diffractometer (Cu K radiation).Transmission electron microscopic (TEM) image and HADDF TEM image were performed on a Tecnai G2 F20 electron microscope (FEI Electron Optics).The energy dispersive X-ray spectrum (EDS) was obtained from an attached Oxford Link ISIS energy-dispersive spectrometer fixed on a Tecnai G2 F20 electron microscope.The surface chemical states of the asprepared samples were measured by X-Ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS, Thermo ESCAlab250) with Al K radiation as the excitation source.All XPS data were calibrated referring to the C 1s peak (284.8 eV) derived from the impurity carbon source. 31P solid-state magic angle spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurement was carried out on a Bruker Avance II spectrometer.Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were carried out on a UV-3600 Shimadzu spectroscope in the range of 300-800 nm, using BaSO 4 as a reference.Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were obtained at room temperature with a fluorescence spectrometer (Hitachi F-4600) excited by incident light of 470 nm.The specific surface area was determined with Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method at 77 K using an adsorption apparatus (Micromeritics TriStar 3000).Thermo gravimetricdifferential thermal analysis (TG-DTA) was carried out on NETZSCH STA449F3 from 40 to 850 oC at a heating rate of 5 oC min -1 .CO 2 temperature programmed desorption (CO 2 -TPD) measurement was performed on Micromeritics Autochem II 2920.The sample (CN or P10-550) was degassed at 300 oC for 30 min in He flow and then cooled to 25 oC, followed by saturated with CO 2 for 1 h.When the baseline reached stable, the sample was heated to 420 oC at a ramp of 10 oC min -1 , the desorption amounts of CO 2 was detected by thermal conductivity detector (TCD).Fourier transformed infrared (FTIR) spectra were conducted on a Nicoler iS10 spectrometer.Before FTIR measurement, the catalyst was purged with Ar at 200 C for 2 h to remove the adsorbed water and other impurities on its surface and then the test was performed when the temperature dropped to 30 C.In-situ Fourier transformed infrared (FTIR) spectra were conducted as the following steps: before the introduction of CO 2 , the FTIR spectrum of the photocatalyst in dark under N 2 atmosphere was collected as the background.Then, CO 2 /H 2 O flow was introduced, and the FTIR spectrum was obtained by subtracting the background.Finally, under illumination and at the presence of CO 2 /H 2 O, the in-situ FTIR spectra were collected at an interval of 10 min during the photocatalytic reaction. The electrochemical measurement was carried out on a CHI 760E electrochemical workstation (Chenhua Instruments), in which a standard three-electrode cell was composed of an FTO glass working electrode, a platinum wire counter electrode and a saturated Ag/AgCl reference electrode.The working electrodes were prepared as follows: sample powder (20 mg) was ground with iodine (40 mg) and the mixture was dispersed in acetone (25 mL).The FTO glass was kept in the above solution for 5 min with a 10 V bias under potential control.Finally, a homogeneous film was obtained after calcination in an oven at 150 C for 2 h.50 mL of 0.2 M Na 2 SO 4 was used as the electrolyte solution.A 300 W Xe lamp (Aulight CEL-HX) was used to irradiate the working electrode from the back side.I-t curves of samples were conducted with several on-off cycles of periodic irradiation at a bias potential of 0.2 V. A glass reactor was used for CO 2 photocatalytic reduction and the top of the reactor was equipped with an optical quartz window (volume of 472 mL).In a typical process, 30 mg of catalyst was dispersed into 4 mL of ethanol by ultrasonication and then transferred on a square plate (2.5 cm 2.5 cm), forming a smooth and thin film.After loading the photocatalysts into reactor, high purity N 2 (99.99) flowed through the reactor for 0.5 h to ensure that air was eliminated.The humid CO 2 was generated by CO 2 (99.99 ) flowing through a water bubbler and purged the reactor for 0.5 h and then kept balance for another 0.5 h in a closed environment.

The structures of CN and P10-550 were studied by XRD technique (Fig. 2a).P10-550 shows a similar XRD pattern with CN and other peaks could not be detected, suggesting that the crystalline structure of CN hardly changes after P doping.The weaker peak at 13.1 corresponds to the in-plane tri-s-triazine motif (1 0 0) with a period of 0.675 nm, while the stronger peak at 27.6 can be indexed to the (0 0 2) interlayer-stacking with a distance of 0.317 nm. 242526 The FTIR spectra of both samples are shown in Fig. 2b.All the characteristic peaks of CN in P10-550 can be observed, which indicates that the chemical structure is well maintained after P doping.The wide band around 30003500 cm -1 is mainly assigned to the stretching modes of N-H (NH), which is related to the uncondensed terminal amino groups. 27A series of peaks in the range of 12001600 cm -1 correspond to the typical stretching mode of C-N heterocycles.A sharp peak at 810 cm -1 is attributed to the bending vibration of tri-s-triazine units. 5,28 wever, no signals of P-related groups have been detected over P10-550, probably due to the low P-doping content (Table S1). The TEM and HADDF TEM images show the morphology of as-prepared samples.As shown in Fig. 3a, the sample P10-550 possesses randomly organized nanosheets which forms a layered platelet-like structure.The elemental mappings in Fig. 3b-e further confirm that P element has been uniformly dispersed in the CN matrix. To investigate the corresponding chemical state of elements in CN and P10-550, XPS analysis and 31 P solid-state MAS NMR were performed.As can been seen in Fig. S1, elements of C, N and O can be found in CN and element of P can be found in P10-550.The elemental concentrations in CN and P10-550 are shown in Table S1.The high resolution C 1s XPS spectra of the two samples (Fig. 4a) can be divided into two peaks located at 288.2 eV and 284.8 eV, which can be attributed to the sp 2hybridized C (N-CN) and carbon impurities, respectively. 29The N 1s spectra of the two samples (Fig. 4b) can be deconvolved into three peaks.The peaks at 401.1 eV and 399.7 eV are attributed to the amino functional groups (C-N-H) and the tertiary N bonded to C atoms (N-C 3 ), respectively.The most intense peak at 398.6 eV corresponds to sp 2 hybridized aromatic N bonded to carbon atoms (C-NC). 30In Fig. 4c, the main O 1s peak located at 532.6 eV is attributed to the adsorbed H 2 O or Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins CO 2 on CN surface. 15In P10-550, the peak at 530.6 eV is attributed to the PO at terminal site. 31The generation of PO may be attributed to the reaction between phosphorus and oxygen during the copolymerization reaction in air at elevated temperatures.In Fig. 4d, the P 2p peak of P10-550 can be divided into two subpeaks.The main peak located at 133.6 eV is assigned to P-N coordination (P-C bonding would be about 1-2 eV lower). 20,31,32 Te peak located at 135.2 eV is assigned to PO bonding, which is consistent with the result of O 1s spectrum of P10-550. 22e performed 31 P solid-state MAS NMR measurement to verify the chemical environment of P element doped in the polymeric CN network.As shown in Fig. 4e, the spectrum of P10-550 reveals four signals at 1.6, -8.8, -18.6 and -30.1 ppm.The signal at 1.6 ppm is associated with PO at edge terminal positions and signals at -8.8 and -18.6 ppm can be ascribed to P atoms at the corner and bay sites, respectively. 22The signal at -30.1 ppm can be attributed to the neighbour effects between CN layers. 20As shown in Fig. 4f, we speculated the possible form of P atoms in CN framework according to results above. UV-vis DRS spectra were recorded to study the light absorption of samples.As shown in Fig. 5a, the light absorption intensity of P10-550 is similar with CN in the full spectrum and the absorption edge of P10-550 shows a slight blue-shift as compared to CN.Based on the Fig. 5b, the optical bandgap (E g ) energies of CN and P10-550 are acquired by the Tauc plot method, which are 2.77 eV and 2.81 eV, respectively. Resulting from the irradiation recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes, the PL emission is a useful tool in investigating the separation and recombination behavior of photogenerated charge carriers.As shown in Fig. 6a, the PL spectra of CN and P10-550 show an emission peak at about 470 nm under the excitation at 380 nm.Clearly, the PL intensity of P10-550 is lower than that of CN, indicating that the irradiation recombination rate of charge carriers in P10-550 is lower than that in CN.Fig. 6b and Table S4 shows the time-resolved PL decay spectra of the samples.The average lifetime of charge carriers in P10-550 is 40.1 ns, which is much longer than that in CN (33.2 ns). The excitation, separation and transfer of photogenerated charge carriers in samples were studied by photocurrent measurement, and the charge collection efficiency was evaluated by the photocurrent value.As displayed in Fig. 7, P10-550 has a higher photocurrent intensity than CN, indicating that P10-550 has a higher electron-hole separation efficiency and a lower charge carrier recombination rate than CN.Based on these results, it can be concluded that P doping has improved the separation and transfer of photogenerated charge carriers, that is, more excited electrons could have the opportunity to participate in the CO 2 photoreduction reaction. Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms and pore-size distribution curves are shown in Fig. 8a and the corresponding data are shown in Table S2.The resultant BET surface areas are 41.5 and 35.5 m 2 g -1 , pore volumes are 0.32 and 0.27 cm 3 g -1 and average pore diameters are 31.2and 28.8 nm for CN and P10-550, respectively.Although the surface area and pore volume of P10-550 are slightly lower than those of pure CN, P doped CN still exhibits improved CO 2 photoreduction performance.This suggests that the P doping is the dominant contributor to the enhanced photocatalytic activity. The CO 2 -TPD was carried out to study the CO 2 adsorption ability of CN and P10-550.According to the TG-DTA result (Fig. S2), the decomposition of P10-550 occurs above 480 C, so the CO 2 -TPD experiments were performed below 400 C.The results in Fig. 8b and Table.S3 show CO 2 desorption at 96 C corresponding to a desorption capacity of 63 mol g -1 over CN, while the CO 2 desorption temperature slightly shifts to 92 C and the corresponding desorption capacity is 27 mol g -1 for P10-550.The CO 2 desorption capacity at this low temperature is related to the physical adsorption, the capacity of which may be mainly related to the surface area.The decreased desorption capacity of CO 2 on P10-550 at the lower temperature can be attributed to the lower surface area and smaller pore volume.Notably, there is a strong CO 2 desorption at 314 C on P10-550, corresponding to a desorption capacity of 235 mol g -1 .The CO 2 desorption capacity at elevated temperature is related to the chemical adsorption, which should be ascribed to the surface species. 33The secondary and tertiary amine groups respectively play roles of Lewis and Bronsted basic sites in pure CN. 34 As is known to all, P has five valence electrons, while C has four and the electronegativity of P is lower than that of C (P2.19, C2.55, N3.04). 35,36 hen a P atom occupies the C site in the framework, the one extra electron from P atom will delocalize into the -conjugated triazine, 20 and the nearby N atoms can share more electrons, thus the basic sites have stronger alkalinity, which is confirmed by the results of CO 2 -TPD (Fig. 8b) and zeta potentials (Fig. S3).We suppose that P atoms doped in CN matrix may enhance the alkalinity of basic sites.Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins The total CO 2 desorption capacity of P10-550 is 3.62 times that of CN, which indicates that the P doping has significantly elevated the CO 2 adsorption capacity and chemisorption energy of the catalyst, which will greatly benefit the CO 2 activation on the catalyst surface. The CO 2 conversion intermediates were detected by in-situ FTIR to further gain insight into the CO 2 reduction process on photocatalysts.As shown in Fig. 9a After being exposed to the CO 2 and H 2 O mixture gas (in dark), the FTIR spectra of CN and P10-550 were collected (Fig. 9a andS4).After the moist CO 2 adsorption, a strong CO 2 signal (2500-2200 cm -1 ) 33 can be detected on the catalysts and several carbonates and carboxylates (2200-1000 cm -1 ) have formed on their surface: carbonate ion (CO 3 2-, 1082 cm -1 ), hydrocarboxylate (HCO 3 -, 1171 cm -1 ) and monodentate carbonate (m-CO 3 2-, 1534 cm -1 ).Additionally, the peak at about 1679 cm -1 is ascribed to the bending vibration of carboxylate (CO 2 -).Compared with CN, more types of carbonate and higher signal intensity can be found on P10-550, which indicates that CO 2 adsorbed on P10-550 could be transformed to carboxylate and carbonate species more quickly than that on pure CN, which is consistent with the result of CO 2 -TPD that P10-550 has stronger chemical adsorption capability for CO 2 than CN. As shown in Fig. 9b andc, during the illumination within 1 h, the amounts of intermediates on the surfaces of CN and P10-550 vary.And the bands around 1750, 1679 and 1534 cm -1 are ascribed to t-CO 3 2-and CO 2 -, m-CO 3 2-, respectively.As shown in Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins Fig. 9b, the intensity of carbonate species (t-CO 3 2-, m-CO 3 2-) 13,14,37 on CN is positive and increases slightly, indicating the formation of these intermediates during the process of CO 2 photoreduction.While the band intensities of CO 2 -on P10-550 (Fig. 9c) is positive and increases quickly within 60 min, suggesting that the adsorbed CO 2 can easily accept electron from P10-550, and then be activated to CO 2 -.By contrast, CO 2 - group is difficult to form on pure CN surface, which may block the CO 2 reduction.Meanwhile, the intensity of m-CO 3 2- increases obviously during the reaction, also hinting the rapidly generation of monodetate carbonates (m-CO 3 2-) on P10-550, which is quite different from the slightly increment of m-CO 3 2- on CN.These results prove that the localized electrons in P doped CN could greatly promote the activation of stable CO 2 molecules and accelerate the photoreduction of CO 2 to CO. The stability of P10-550 was investigated by repeating the experiment in four cycles under the same condition (with the replacement of fresh CO 2 and H 2 O before each run) and each cycle was maintained for 5 h.After the 1st run, the catalyst was directly used to perform the 2nd cycle.The catalyst was treated with N 2 under 250 C before the 3rd and 4th cycles.As shown in Fig. 10a, the performance of the catalyst becomes lower at the 2nd cycle and recovered partially in the 3rd and 4th cycles.According to the results of in-situ FTIR, intermediates generated during photocatalytic reduction process may cover the surface of catalyst, which would inhibit the adsorption of CO 2 molecules and lead to the activity attenuation in the next cycle. To detect the changes of P10-550 after CO 2 photoreduction, the reaction of CO 2 photoreduction over P10-550 was performed for 20 h with periodical replacement of fresh CO 2 and H 2 O every 4 h.After the reaction, the catalyst was collected with no heating treatment and labeled as \"P10-550 Used\".The XPS and 31 P solid-state MAS NMR spectrum of P10-550 Used are shown in Fig. 10.As shown in Fig. 10b, the signal at -30.1 ppm assigned to the neighbor effects disappears and the one at -19.0 ascribing to the P-N at bay site decreases remarkably.While the signal at -8.9 ppm assigned to the P-N at corner site is less changed.Meanwhile, a new signal at -2.5 ppm assigned to P-OH appears.As illustrated by O 1s XPS spectra shown in Fig. 10c, after CO 2 photoreduction, the signal of adsorbed H 2 O or CO 2 on the surface of P10-550 has much intensified, and a new peak at 531.2 eV ascribing to P-OH emerges, which is in accordance with the detection of P-OH bonding at 134.4 eV in the P 2p XPS of P10-550 Used (Fig. 10d). Prasetyanto et al. demonstrated that the combination of secondary and tertiary amine resulted in higher rate of CO 2 activation than single type amine species, and the formation of CO 2 -from adsorbed CO 2 was recognized to be the first step. 38,39 reover, the one lone electron of P atom bonded to N atoms can enhance the alkalinity of the nearby basic sites, which further promotes the adsorption and activation of CO 2 on the Pdoped CN (Fig. 4f).Due to the special chemical environment, the N atoms near bay site P atoms show higher activity in the CO 2 photoreduction process than other N atoms.Above all, we hereby attempt to propose a possible CO 2 reduction process on this P-doped CN photocatalyst (Fig. S5).During the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, the positive-charged P atoms will combine with hydroxide ion (OH -) forming the Lewis acid sites 40 .CO 2 adsorbed on the N atoms nearby transforms to radical CO 2 -by accepting an electron, which is proved by the in-situ FTIR results.Afterward, P-OH can form hydrogen bond with O atoms from CO 2 -, accelerating the dissociation of CO 2 -to CO.The P-OH structure is generated and exists in the entire CO 2 photoreduction process, as indicated by XPS and 31 P NMR results.The well-retained Lewis acid site P-OH after the CO 2 photoreduction process may play a good role in the next photocatalytic cycle, thus ensure the recyclability and stability of P10-550."}, {"llm generation": "P-doped CN photocatalyst", "source": "Above all, we hereby attempt to propose a possible CO 2 reduction process on this P-doped CN photocatalyst (Fig. S5).", "context": "On all as-obtained catalysts, CO was the main product of CO 2 reduction, while the signals of other carbonaceous products were negligible.As shown in Fig. 1, the CO 2 reduction performance of CN is effectively improved after P doping.Both synthesis temperature and P doping amount influence CO 2 photoreduction performance of the catalysts.Among all samples, P10-550 exhibits the highest CO evolution amount.The CO evolution amount reaches 0.349 mol (30 mg, 3 h), which is 3.5 times that of pure CN.When the copolymerization was conducted at 550 C, the obtained catalyst showed higher activity than those fabricated at lower and higher temperatures (Fig. 1a), which might be attributed to the incomplete copolymerization at over-low temperatures and the framework disruption at over-high temperatures, respectively.As the amount of P doping increases, the photocatalytic activity increases, reaching a maximum at P10-550 and then decreases with the continuous increase of P doping amount (Fig. 1b).Excessive P atoms doped in the framework of CN might be the recombination sites of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, thus reduce the catalytic performance.To deep-understand the effects of P doping on the activity of CO 2 photoreduction, detailed characterizations and in-situ FTIR investigation have been conducted and are discussed as follows.

The CO 2 -TPD was carried out to study the CO 2 adsorption ability of CN and P10-550.According to the TG-DTA result (Fig. S2), the decomposition of P10-550 occurs above 480 C, so the CO 2 -TPD experiments were performed below 400 C.The results in Fig. 8b and Table.S3 show CO 2 desorption at 96 C corresponding to a desorption capacity of 63 mol g -1 over CN, while the CO 2 desorption temperature slightly shifts to 92 C and the corresponding desorption capacity is 27 mol g -1 for P10-550.The CO 2 desorption capacity at this low temperature is related to the physical adsorption, the capacity of which may be mainly related to the surface area.The decreased desorption capacity of CO 2 on P10-550 at the lower temperature can be attributed to the lower surface area and smaller pore volume.Notably, there is a strong CO 2 desorption at 314 C on P10-550, corresponding to a desorption capacity of 235 mol g -1 .The CO 2 desorption capacity at elevated temperature is related to the chemical adsorption, which should be ascribed to the surface species. 33The secondary and tertiary amine groups respectively play roles of Lewis and Bronsted basic sites in pure CN. 34 As is known to all, P has five valence electrons, while C has four and the electronegativity of P is lower than that of C (P2.19, C2.55, N3.04). 35,36 hen a P atom occupies the C site in the framework, the one extra electron from P atom will delocalize into the -conjugated triazine, 20 and the nearby N atoms can share more electrons, thus the basic sites have stronger alkalinity, which is confirmed by the results of CO 2 -TPD (Fig. 8b) and zeta potentials (Fig. S3).We suppose that P atoms doped in CN matrix may enhance the alkalinity of basic sites.Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins The total CO 2 desorption capacity of P10-550 is 3.62 times that of CN, which indicates that the P doping has significantly elevated the CO 2 adsorption capacity and chemisorption energy of the catalyst, which will greatly benefit the CO 2 activation on the catalyst surface. The CO 2 conversion intermediates were detected by in-situ FTIR to further gain insight into the CO 2 reduction process on photocatalysts.As shown in Fig. 9a After being exposed to the CO 2 and H 2 O mixture gas (in dark), the FTIR spectra of CN and P10-550 were collected (Fig. 9a andS4).After the moist CO 2 adsorption, a strong CO 2 signal (2500-2200 cm -1 ) 33 can be detected on the catalysts and several carbonates and carboxylates (2200-1000 cm -1 ) have formed on their surface: carbonate ion (CO 3 2-, 1082 cm -1 ), hydrocarboxylate (HCO 3 -, 1171 cm -1 ) and monodentate carbonate (m-CO 3 2-, 1534 cm -1 ).Additionally, the peak at about 1679 cm -1 is ascribed to the bending vibration of carboxylate (CO 2 -).Compared with CN, more types of carbonate and higher signal intensity can be found on P10-550, which indicates that CO 2 adsorbed on P10-550 could be transformed to carboxylate and carbonate species more quickly than that on pure CN, which is consistent with the result of CO 2 -TPD that P10-550 has stronger chemical adsorption capability for CO 2 than CN. As shown in Fig. 9b andc, during the illumination within 1 h, the amounts of intermediates on the surfaces of CN and P10-550 vary.And the bands around 1750, 1679 and 1534 cm -1 are ascribed to t-CO 3 2-and CO 2 -, m-CO 3 2-, respectively.As shown in Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins Fig. 9b, the intensity of carbonate species (t-CO 3 2-, m-CO 3 2-) 13,14,37 on CN is positive and increases slightly, indicating the formation of these intermediates during the process of CO 2 photoreduction.While the band intensities of CO 2 -on P10-550 (Fig. 9c) is positive and increases quickly within 60 min, suggesting that the adsorbed CO 2 can easily accept electron from P10-550, and then be activated to CO 2 -.By contrast, CO 2 - group is difficult to form on pure CN surface, which may block the CO 2 reduction.Meanwhile, the intensity of m-CO 3 2- increases obviously during the reaction, also hinting the rapidly generation of monodetate carbonates (m-CO 3 2-) on P10-550, which is quite different from the slightly increment of m-CO 3 2- on CN.These results prove that the localized electrons in P doped CN could greatly promote the activation of stable CO 2 molecules and accelerate the photoreduction of CO 2 to CO. The stability of P10-550 was investigated by repeating the experiment in four cycles under the same condition (with the replacement of fresh CO 2 and H 2 O before each run) and each cycle was maintained for 5 h.After the 1st run, the catalyst was directly used to perform the 2nd cycle.The catalyst was treated with N 2 under 250 C before the 3rd and 4th cycles.As shown in Fig. 10a, the performance of the catalyst becomes lower at the 2nd cycle and recovered partially in the 3rd and 4th cycles.According to the results of in-situ FTIR, intermediates generated during photocatalytic reduction process may cover the surface of catalyst, which would inhibit the adsorption of CO 2 molecules and lead to the activity attenuation in the next cycle. To detect the changes of P10-550 after CO 2 photoreduction, the reaction of CO 2 photoreduction over P10-550 was performed for 20 h with periodical replacement of fresh CO 2 and H 2 O every 4 h.After the reaction, the catalyst was collected with no heating treatment and labeled as \"P10-550 Used\".The XPS and 31 P solid-state MAS NMR spectrum of P10-550 Used are shown in Fig. 10.As shown in Fig. 10b, the signal at -30.1 ppm assigned to the neighbor effects disappears and the one at -19.0 ascribing to the P-N at bay site decreases remarkably.While the signal at -8.9 ppm assigned to the P-N at corner site is less changed.Meanwhile, a new signal at -2.5 ppm assigned to P-OH appears.As illustrated by O 1s XPS spectra shown in Fig. 10c, after CO 2 photoreduction, the signal of adsorbed H 2 O or CO 2 on the surface of P10-550 has much intensified, and a new peak at 531.2 eV ascribing to P-OH emerges, which is in accordance with the detection of P-OH bonding at 134.4 eV in the P 2p XPS of P10-550 Used (Fig. 10d). Prasetyanto et al. demonstrated that the combination of secondary and tertiary amine resulted in higher rate of CO 2 activation than single type amine species, and the formation of CO 2 -from adsorbed CO 2 was recognized to be the first step. 38,39 reover, the one lone electron of P atom bonded to N atoms can enhance the alkalinity of the nearby basic sites, which further promotes the adsorption and activation of CO 2 on the Pdoped CN (Fig. 4f).Due to the special chemical environment, the N atoms near bay site P atoms show higher activity in the CO 2 photoreduction process than other N atoms.Above all, we hereby attempt to propose a possible CO 2 reduction process on this P-doped CN photocatalyst (Fig. S5).During the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, the positive-charged P atoms will combine with hydroxide ion (OH -) forming the Lewis acid sites 40 .CO 2 adsorbed on the N atoms nearby transforms to radical CO 2 -by accepting an electron, which is proved by the in-situ FTIR results.Afterward, P-OH can form hydrogen bond with O atoms from CO 2 -, accelerating the dissociation of CO 2 -to CO.The P-OH structure is generated and exists in the entire CO 2 photoreduction process, as indicated by XPS and 31 P NMR results.The well-retained Lewis acid site P-OH after the CO 2 photoreduction process may play a good role in the next photocatalytic cycle, thus ensure the recyclability and stability of P10-550."}, {"llm generation": "P-doped polymeric carbon nitride (CN)", "source": "In summary, we have studied CO 2 photocatalytic reduction performance of P-doped polymeric carbon nitride (CN).", "context": "In summary, we have studied CO 2 photocatalytic reduction performance of P-doped polymeric carbon nitride (CN).Compared with pure CN, P-doped CN has higher performance in the photoreduction of CO 2 to CO.More importantly, the mechanism of P-doping effect on the catalytic activity has been probed in-depth.The doping of P atoms alters the electronic structure of CN by promoting the electron delocalization, prolonging the charge carrier lifetime and elevating the utilization of photogenerated charge carriers.P doping could also enhance the alkalinity of basic sites, thereby promoting the adsorption and activation of CO 2 .Mechanistically, the P doped CN catalyst plays a role of electron donation to CO 2 in the CO 2 photocatalytic reduction under illumination, forming CO 2 -, and resultantly accelerating its transformation to CO.This work provides an example of improving CO 2 photoreduction performance by the modulation of electron structure and active sites.The understanding on the effect of non-metal element doping in CN on its CO 2 reduction activity will help to rationally design photocatalysts with enhanced performance and stability.

The structures of CN and P10-550 were studied by XRD technique (Fig. 2a).P10-550 shows a similar XRD pattern with CN and other peaks could not be detected, suggesting that the crystalline structure of CN hardly changes after P doping.The weaker peak at 13.1 corresponds to the in-plane tri-s-triazine motif (1 0 0) with a period of 0.675 nm, while the stronger peak at 27.6 can be indexed to the (0 0 2) interlayer-stacking with a distance of 0.317 nm. 242526 The FTIR spectra of both samples are shown in Fig. 2b.All the characteristic peaks of CN in P10-550 can be observed, which indicates that the chemical structure is well maintained after P doping.The wide band around 30003500 cm -1 is mainly assigned to the stretching modes of N-H (NH), which is related to the uncondensed terminal amino groups. 27A series of peaks in the range of 12001600 cm -1 correspond to the typical stretching mode of C-N heterocycles.A sharp peak at 810 cm -1 is attributed to the bending vibration of tri-s-triazine units. 5,28 wever, no signals of P-related groups have been detected over P10-550, probably due to the low P-doping content (Table S1). The TEM and HADDF TEM images show the morphology of as-prepared samples.As shown in Fig. 3a, the sample P10-550 possesses randomly organized nanosheets which forms a layered platelet-like structure.The elemental mappings in Fig. 3b-e further confirm that P element has been uniformly dispersed in the CN matrix. To investigate the corresponding chemical state of elements in CN and P10-550, XPS analysis and 31 P solid-state MAS NMR were performed.As can been seen in Fig. S1, elements of C, N and O can be found in CN and element of P can be found in P10-550.The elemental concentrations in CN and P10-550 are shown in Table S1.The high resolution C 1s XPS spectra of the two samples (Fig. 4a) can be divided into two peaks located at 288.2 eV and 284.8 eV, which can be attributed to the sp 2hybridized C (N-CN) and carbon impurities, respectively. 29The N 1s spectra of the two samples (Fig. 4b) can be deconvolved into three peaks.The peaks at 401.1 eV and 399.7 eV are attributed to the amino functional groups (C-N-H) and the tertiary N bonded to C atoms (N-C 3 ), respectively.The most intense peak at 398.6 eV corresponds to sp 2 hybridized aromatic N bonded to carbon atoms (C-NC). 30In Fig. 4c, the main O 1s peak located at 532.6 eV is attributed to the adsorbed H 2 O or Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins CO 2 on CN surface. 15In P10-550, the peak at 530.6 eV is attributed to the PO at terminal site. 31The generation of PO may be attributed to the reaction between phosphorus and oxygen during the copolymerization reaction in air at elevated temperatures.In Fig. 4d, the P 2p peak of P10-550 can be divided into two subpeaks.The main peak located at 133.6 eV is assigned to P-N coordination (P-C bonding would be about 1-2 eV lower). 20,31,32 Te peak located at 135.2 eV is assigned to PO bonding, which is consistent with the result of O 1s spectrum of P10-550. 22e performed 31 P solid-state MAS NMR measurement to verify the chemical environment of P element doped in the polymeric CN network.As shown in Fig. 4e, the spectrum of P10-550 reveals four signals at 1.6, -8.8, -18.6 and -30.1 ppm.The signal at 1.6 ppm is associated with PO at edge terminal positions and signals at -8.8 and -18.6 ppm can be ascribed to P atoms at the corner and bay sites, respectively. 22The signal at -30.1 ppm can be attributed to the neighbour effects between CN layers. 20As shown in Fig. 4f, we speculated the possible form of P atoms in CN framework according to results above. UV-vis DRS spectra were recorded to study the light absorption of samples.As shown in Fig. 5a, the light absorption intensity of P10-550 is similar with CN in the full spectrum and the absorption edge of P10-550 shows a slight blue-shift as compared to CN.Based on the Fig. 5b, the optical bandgap (E g ) energies of CN and P10-550 are acquired by the Tauc plot method, which are 2.77 eV and 2.81 eV, respectively. Resulting from the irradiation recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes, the PL emission is a useful tool in investigating the separation and recombination behavior of photogenerated charge carriers.As shown in Fig. 6a, the PL spectra of CN and P10-550 show an emission peak at about 470 nm under the excitation at 380 nm.Clearly, the PL intensity of P10-550 is lower than that of CN, indicating that the irradiation recombination rate of charge carriers in P10-550 is lower than that in CN.Fig. 6b and Table S4 shows the time-resolved PL decay spectra of the samples.The average lifetime of charge carriers in P10-550 is 40.1 ns, which is much longer than that in CN (33.2 ns). The excitation, separation and transfer of photogenerated charge carriers in samples were studied by photocurrent measurement, and the charge collection efficiency was evaluated by the photocurrent value.As displayed in Fig. 7, P10-550 has a higher photocurrent intensity than CN, indicating that P10-550 has a higher electron-hole separation efficiency and a lower charge carrier recombination rate than CN.Based on these results, it can be concluded that P doping has improved the separation and transfer of photogenerated charge carriers, that is, more excited electrons could have the opportunity to participate in the CO 2 photoreduction reaction. Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms and pore-size distribution curves are shown in Fig. 8a and the corresponding data are shown in Table S2.The resultant BET surface areas are 41.5 and 35.5 m 2 g -1 , pore volumes are 0.32 and 0.27 cm 3 g -1 and average pore diameters are 31.2and 28.8 nm for CN and P10-550, respectively.Although the surface area and pore volume of P10-550 are slightly lower than those of pure CN, P doped CN still exhibits improved CO 2 photoreduction performance.This suggests that the P doping is the dominant contributor to the enhanced photocatalytic activity. The CO 2 -TPD was carried out to study the CO 2 adsorption ability of CN and P10-550.According to the TG-DTA result (Fig. S2), the decomposition of P10-550 occurs above 480 C, so the CO 2 -TPD experiments were performed below 400 C.The results in Fig. 8b and Table.S3 show CO 2 desorption at 96 C corresponding to a desorption capacity of 63 mol g -1 over CN, while the CO 2 desorption temperature slightly shifts to 92 C and the corresponding desorption capacity is 27 mol g -1 for P10-550.The CO 2 desorption capacity at this low temperature is related to the physical adsorption, the capacity of which may be mainly related to the surface area.The decreased desorption capacity of CO 2 on P10-550 at the lower temperature can be attributed to the lower surface area and smaller pore volume.Notably, there is a strong CO 2 desorption at 314 C on P10-550, corresponding to a desorption capacity of 235 mol g -1 .The CO 2 desorption capacity at elevated temperature is related to the chemical adsorption, which should be ascribed to the surface species. 33The secondary and tertiary amine groups respectively play roles of Lewis and Bronsted basic sites in pure CN. 34 As is known to all, P has five valence electrons, while C has four and the electronegativity of P is lower than that of C (P2.19, C2.55, N3.04). 35,36 hen a P atom occupies the C site in the framework, the one extra electron from P atom will delocalize into the -conjugated triazine, 20 and the nearby N atoms can share more electrons, thus the basic sites have stronger alkalinity, which is confirmed by the results of CO 2 -TPD (Fig. 8b) and zeta potentials (Fig. S3).We suppose that P atoms doped in CN matrix may enhance the alkalinity of basic sites.Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins The total CO 2 desorption capacity of P10-550 is 3.62 times that of CN, which indicates that the P doping has significantly elevated the CO 2 adsorption capacity and chemisorption energy of the catalyst, which will greatly benefit the CO 2 activation on the catalyst surface. The CO 2 conversion intermediates were detected by in-situ FTIR to further gain insight into the CO 2 reduction process on photocatalysts.As shown in Fig. 9a After being exposed to the CO 2 and H 2 O mixture gas (in dark), the FTIR spectra of CN and P10-550 were collected (Fig. 9a andS4).After the moist CO 2 adsorption, a strong CO 2 signal (2500-2200 cm -1 ) 33 can be detected on the catalysts and several carbonates and carboxylates (2200-1000 cm -1 ) have formed on their surface: carbonate ion (CO 3 2-, 1082 cm -1 ), hydrocarboxylate (HCO 3 -, 1171 cm -1 ) and monodentate carbonate (m-CO 3 2-, 1534 cm -1 ).Additionally, the peak at about 1679 cm -1 is ascribed to the bending vibration of carboxylate (CO 2 -).Compared with CN, more types of carbonate and higher signal intensity can be found on P10-550, which indicates that CO 2 adsorbed on P10-550 could be transformed to carboxylate and carbonate species more quickly than that on pure CN, which is consistent with the result of CO 2 -TPD that P10-550 has stronger chemical adsorption capability for CO 2 than CN. As shown in Fig. 9b andc, during the illumination within 1 h, the amounts of intermediates on the surfaces of CN and P10-550 vary.And the bands around 1750, 1679 and 1534 cm -1 are ascribed to t-CO 3 2-and CO 2 -, m-CO 3 2-, respectively.As shown in Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins Fig. 9b, the intensity of carbonate species (t-CO 3 2-, m-CO 3 2-) 13,14,37 on CN is positive and increases slightly, indicating the formation of these intermediates during the process of CO 2 photoreduction.While the band intensities of CO 2 -on P10-550 (Fig. 9c) is positive and increases quickly within 60 min, suggesting that the adsorbed CO 2 can easily accept electron from P10-550, and then be activated to CO 2 -.By contrast, CO 2 - group is difficult to form on pure CN surface, which may block the CO 2 reduction.Meanwhile, the intensity of m-CO 3 2- increases obviously during the reaction, also hinting the rapidly generation of monodetate carbonates (m-CO 3 2-) on P10-550, which is quite different from the slightly increment of m-CO 3 2- on CN.These results prove that the localized electrons in P doped CN could greatly promote the activation of stable CO 2 molecules and accelerate the photoreduction of CO 2 to CO. The stability of P10-550 was investigated by repeating the experiment in four cycles under the same condition (with the replacement of fresh CO 2 and H 2 O before each run) and each cycle was maintained for 5 h.After the 1st run, the catalyst was directly used to perform the 2nd cycle.The catalyst was treated with N 2 under 250 C before the 3rd and 4th cycles.As shown in Fig. 10a, the performance of the catalyst becomes lower at the 2nd cycle and recovered partially in the 3rd and 4th cycles.According to the results of in-situ FTIR, intermediates generated during photocatalytic reduction process may cover the surface of catalyst, which would inhibit the adsorption of CO 2 molecules and lead to the activity attenuation in the next cycle. To detect the changes of P10-550 after CO 2 photoreduction, the reaction of CO 2 photoreduction over P10-550 was performed for 20 h with periodical replacement of fresh CO 2 and H 2 O every 4 h.After the reaction, the catalyst was collected with no heating treatment and labeled as \"P10-550 Used\".The XPS and 31 P solid-state MAS NMR spectrum of P10-550 Used are shown in Fig. 10.As shown in Fig. 10b, the signal at -30.1 ppm assigned to the neighbor effects disappears and the one at -19.0 ascribing to the P-N at bay site decreases remarkably.While the signal at -8.9 ppm assigned to the P-N at corner site is less changed.Meanwhile, a new signal at -2.5 ppm assigned to P-OH appears.As illustrated by O 1s XPS spectra shown in Fig. 10c, after CO 2 photoreduction, the signal of adsorbed H 2 O or CO 2 on the surface of P10-550 has much intensified, and a new peak at 531.2 eV ascribing to P-OH emerges, which is in accordance with the detection of P-OH bonding at 134.4 eV in the P 2p XPS of P10-550 Used (Fig. 10d). Prasetyanto et al. demonstrated that the combination of secondary and tertiary amine resulted in higher rate of CO 2 activation than single type amine species, and the formation of CO 2 -from adsorbed CO 2 was recognized to be the first step. 38,39 reover, the one lone electron of P atom bonded to N atoms can enhance the alkalinity of the nearby basic sites, which further promotes the adsorption and activation of CO 2 on the Pdoped CN (Fig. 4f).Due to the special chemical environment, the N atoms near bay site P atoms show higher activity in the CO 2 photoreduction process than other N atoms.Above all, we hereby attempt to propose a possible CO 2 reduction process on this P-doped CN photocatalyst (Fig. S5).During the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, the positive-charged P atoms will combine with hydroxide ion (OH -) forming the Lewis acid sites 40 .CO 2 adsorbed on the N atoms nearby transforms to radical CO 2 -by accepting an electron, which is proved by the in-situ FTIR results.Afterward, P-OH can form hydrogen bond with O atoms from CO 2 -, accelerating the dissociation of CO 2 -to CO.The P-OH structure is generated and exists in the entire CO 2 photoreduction process, as indicated by XPS and 31 P NMR results.The well-retained Lewis acid site P-OH after the CO 2 photoreduction process may play a good role in the next photocatalytic cycle, thus ensure the recyclability and stability of P10-550."}, {"llm generation": "Gas", "source": "Fig. 9 (a) In-situ FTIR spectra of CN and P10-550 with CO2/H2O in dark (The spectrum collected in N2 as background); In-situ FTIR spectra of (b) CN and (c) P10-550 with CO2/H2O under the irradiation for 1 h (the spectrum collected with CO2/H2O in dark as background).", "context": "In summary, we have studied CO 2 photocatalytic reduction performance of P-doped polymeric carbon nitride (CN).Compared with pure CN, P-doped CN has higher performance in the photoreduction of CO 2 to CO.More importantly, the mechanism of P-doping effect on the catalytic activity has been probed in-depth.The doping of P atoms alters the electronic structure of CN by promoting the electron delocalization, prolonging the charge carrier lifetime and elevating the utilization of photogenerated charge carriers.P doping could also enhance the alkalinity of basic sites, thereby promoting the adsorption and activation of CO 2 .Mechanistically, the P doped CN catalyst plays a role of electron donation to CO 2 in the CO 2 photocatalytic reduction under illumination, forming CO 2 -, and resultantly accelerating its transformation to CO.This work provides an example of improving CO 2 photoreduction performance by the modulation of electron structure and active sites.The understanding on the effect of non-metal element doping in CN on its CO 2 reduction activity will help to rationally design photocatalysts with enhanced performance and stability.

The structures of CN and P10-550 were studied by XRD technique (Fig. 2a).P10-550 shows a similar XRD pattern with CN and other peaks could not be detected, suggesting that the crystalline structure of CN hardly changes after P doping.The weaker peak at 13.1 corresponds to the in-plane tri-s-triazine motif (1 0 0) with a period of 0.675 nm, while the stronger peak at 27.6 can be indexed to the (0 0 2) interlayer-stacking with a distance of 0.317 nm. 242526 The FTIR spectra of both samples are shown in Fig. 2b.All the characteristic peaks of CN in P10-550 can be observed, which indicates that the chemical structure is well maintained after P doping.The wide band around 30003500 cm -1 is mainly assigned to the stretching modes of N-H (NH), which is related to the uncondensed terminal amino groups. 27A series of peaks in the range of 12001600 cm -1 correspond to the typical stretching mode of C-N heterocycles.A sharp peak at 810 cm -1 is attributed to the bending vibration of tri-s-triazine units. 5,28 wever, no signals of P-related groups have been detected over P10-550, probably due to the low P-doping content (Table S1). The TEM and HADDF TEM images show the morphology of as-prepared samples.As shown in Fig. 3a, the sample P10-550 possesses randomly organized nanosheets which forms a layered platelet-like structure.The elemental mappings in Fig. 3b-e further confirm that P element has been uniformly dispersed in the CN matrix. To investigate the corresponding chemical state of elements in CN and P10-550, XPS analysis and 31 P solid-state MAS NMR were performed.As can been seen in Fig. S1, elements of C, N and O can be found in CN and element of P can be found in P10-550.The elemental concentrations in CN and P10-550 are shown in Table S1.The high resolution C 1s XPS spectra of the two samples (Fig. 4a) can be divided into two peaks located at 288.2 eV and 284.8 eV, which can be attributed to the sp 2hybridized C (N-CN) and carbon impurities, respectively. 29The N 1s spectra of the two samples (Fig. 4b) can be deconvolved into three peaks.The peaks at 401.1 eV and 399.7 eV are attributed to the amino functional groups (C-N-H) and the tertiary N bonded to C atoms (N-C 3 ), respectively.The most intense peak at 398.6 eV corresponds to sp 2 hybridized aromatic N bonded to carbon atoms (C-NC). 30In Fig. 4c, the main O 1s peak located at 532.6 eV is attributed to the adsorbed H 2 O or Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins CO 2 on CN surface. 15In P10-550, the peak at 530.6 eV is attributed to the PO at terminal site. 31The generation of PO may be attributed to the reaction between phosphorus and oxygen during the copolymerization reaction in air at elevated temperatures.In Fig. 4d, the P 2p peak of P10-550 can be divided into two subpeaks.The main peak located at 133.6 eV is assigned to P-N coordination (P-C bonding would be about 1-2 eV lower). 20,31,32 Te peak located at 135.2 eV is assigned to PO bonding, which is consistent with the result of O 1s spectrum of P10-550. 22e performed 31 P solid-state MAS NMR measurement to verify the chemical environment of P element doped in the polymeric CN network.As shown in Fig. 4e, the spectrum of P10-550 reveals four signals at 1.6, -8.8, -18.6 and -30.1 ppm.The signal at 1.6 ppm is associated with PO at edge terminal positions and signals at -8.8 and -18.6 ppm can be ascribed to P atoms at the corner and bay sites, respectively. 22The signal at -30.1 ppm can be attributed to the neighbour effects between CN layers. 20As shown in Fig. 4f, we speculated the possible form of P atoms in CN framework according to results above. UV-vis DRS spectra were recorded to study the light absorption of samples.As shown in Fig. 5a, the light absorption intensity of P10-550 is similar with CN in the full spectrum and the absorption edge of P10-550 shows a slight blue-shift as compared to CN.Based on the Fig. 5b, the optical bandgap (E g ) energies of CN and P10-550 are acquired by the Tauc plot method, which are 2.77 eV and 2.81 eV, respectively. Resulting from the irradiation recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes, the PL emission is a useful tool in investigating the separation and recombination behavior of photogenerated charge carriers.As shown in Fig. 6a, the PL spectra of CN and P10-550 show an emission peak at about 470 nm under the excitation at 380 nm.Clearly, the PL intensity of P10-550 is lower than that of CN, indicating that the irradiation recombination rate of charge carriers in P10-550 is lower than that in CN.Fig. 6b and Table S4 shows the time-resolved PL decay spectra of the samples.The average lifetime of charge carriers in P10-550 is 40.1 ns, which is much longer than that in CN (33.2 ns). The excitation, separation and transfer of photogenerated charge carriers in samples were studied by photocurrent measurement, and the charge collection efficiency was evaluated by the photocurrent value.As displayed in Fig. 7, P10-550 has a higher photocurrent intensity than CN, indicating that P10-550 has a higher electron-hole separation efficiency and a lower charge carrier recombination rate than CN.Based on these results, it can be concluded that P doping has improved the separation and transfer of photogenerated charge carriers, that is, more excited electrons could have the opportunity to participate in the CO 2 photoreduction reaction. Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms and pore-size distribution curves are shown in Fig. 8a and the corresponding data are shown in Table S2.The resultant BET surface areas are 41.5 and 35.5 m 2 g -1 , pore volumes are 0.32 and 0.27 cm 3 g -1 and average pore diameters are 31.2and 28.8 nm for CN and P10-550, respectively.Although the surface area and pore volume of P10-550 are slightly lower than those of pure CN, P doped CN still exhibits improved CO 2 photoreduction performance.This suggests that the P doping is the dominant contributor to the enhanced photocatalytic activity. The CO 2 -TPD was carried out to study the CO 2 adsorption ability of CN and P10-550.According to the TG-DTA result (Fig. S2), the decomposition of P10-550 occurs above 480 C, so the CO 2 -TPD experiments were performed below 400 C.The results in Fig. 8b and Table.S3 show CO 2 desorption at 96 C corresponding to a desorption capacity of 63 mol g -1 over CN, while the CO 2 desorption temperature slightly shifts to 92 C and the corresponding desorption capacity is 27 mol g -1 for P10-550.The CO 2 desorption capacity at this low temperature is related to the physical adsorption, the capacity of which may be mainly related to the surface area.The decreased desorption capacity of CO 2 on P10-550 at the lower temperature can be attributed to the lower surface area and smaller pore volume.Notably, there is a strong CO 2 desorption at 314 C on P10-550, corresponding to a desorption capacity of 235 mol g -1 .The CO 2 desorption capacity at elevated temperature is related to the chemical adsorption, which should be ascribed to the surface species. 33The secondary and tertiary amine groups respectively play roles of Lewis and Bronsted basic sites in pure CN. 34 As is known to all, P has five valence electrons, while C has four and the electronegativity of P is lower than that of C (P2.19, C2.55, N3.04). 35,36 hen a P atom occupies the C site in the framework, the one extra electron from P atom will delocalize into the -conjugated triazine, 20 and the nearby N atoms can share more electrons, thus the basic sites have stronger alkalinity, which is confirmed by the results of CO 2 -TPD (Fig. 8b) and zeta potentials (Fig. S3).We suppose that P atoms doped in CN matrix may enhance the alkalinity of basic sites.Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins The total CO 2 desorption capacity of P10-550 is 3.62 times that of CN, which indicates that the P doping has significantly elevated the CO 2 adsorption capacity and chemisorption energy of the catalyst, which will greatly benefit the CO 2 activation on the catalyst surface. The CO 2 conversion intermediates were detected by in-situ FTIR to further gain insight into the CO 2 reduction process on photocatalysts.As shown in Fig. 9a After being exposed to the CO 2 and H 2 O mixture gas (in dark), the FTIR spectra of CN and P10-550 were collected (Fig. 9a andS4).After the moist CO 2 adsorption, a strong CO 2 signal (2500-2200 cm -1 ) 33 can be detected on the catalysts and several carbonates and carboxylates (2200-1000 cm -1 ) have formed on their surface: carbonate ion (CO 3 2-, 1082 cm -1 ), hydrocarboxylate (HCO 3 -, 1171 cm -1 ) and monodentate carbonate (m-CO 3 2-, 1534 cm -1 ).Additionally, the peak at about 1679 cm -1 is ascribed to the bending vibration of carboxylate (CO 2 -).Compared with CN, more types of carbonate and higher signal intensity can be found on P10-550, which indicates that CO 2 adsorbed on P10-550 could be transformed to carboxylate and carbonate species more quickly than that on pure CN, which is consistent with the result of CO 2 -TPD that P10-550 has stronger chemical adsorption capability for CO 2 than CN. As shown in Fig. 9b andc, during the illumination within 1 h, the amounts of intermediates on the surfaces of CN and P10-550 vary.And the bands around 1750, 1679 and 1534 cm -1 are ascribed to t-CO 3 2-and CO 2 -, m-CO 3 2-, respectively.As shown in Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins Fig. 9b, the intensity of carbonate species (t-CO 3 2-, m-CO 3 2-) 13,14,37 on CN is positive and increases slightly, indicating the formation of these intermediates during the process of CO 2 photoreduction.While the band intensities of CO 2 -on P10-550 (Fig. 9c) is positive and increases quickly within 60 min, suggesting that the adsorbed CO 2 can easily accept electron from P10-550, and then be activated to CO 2 -.By contrast, CO 2 - group is difficult to form on pure CN surface, which may block the CO 2 reduction.Meanwhile, the intensity of m-CO 3 2- increases obviously during the reaction, also hinting the rapidly generation of monodetate carbonates (m-CO 3 2-) on P10-550, which is quite different from the slightly increment of m-CO 3 2- on CN.These results prove that the localized electrons in P doped CN could greatly promote the activation of stable CO 2 molecules and accelerate the photoreduction of CO 2 to CO. The stability of P10-550 was investigated by repeating the experiment in four cycles under the same condition (with the replacement of fresh CO 2 and H 2 O before each run) and each cycle was maintained for 5 h.After the 1st run, the catalyst was directly used to perform the 2nd cycle.The catalyst was treated with N 2 under 250 C before the 3rd and 4th cycles.As shown in Fig. 10a, the performance of the catalyst becomes lower at the 2nd cycle and recovered partially in the 3rd and 4th cycles.According to the results of in-situ FTIR, intermediates generated during photocatalytic reduction process may cover the surface of catalyst, which would inhibit the adsorption of CO 2 molecules and lead to the activity attenuation in the next cycle. To detect the changes of P10-550 after CO 2 photoreduction, the reaction of CO 2 photoreduction over P10-550 was performed for 20 h with periodical replacement of fresh CO 2 and H 2 O every 4 h.After the reaction, the catalyst was collected with no heating treatment and labeled as \"P10-550 Used\".The XPS and 31 P solid-state MAS NMR spectrum of P10-550 Used are shown in Fig. 10.As shown in Fig. 10b, the signal at -30.1 ppm assigned to the neighbor effects disappears and the one at -19.0 ascribing to the P-N at bay site decreases remarkably.While the signal at -8.9 ppm assigned to the P-N at corner site is less changed.Meanwhile, a new signal at -2.5 ppm assigned to P-OH appears.As illustrated by O 1s XPS spectra shown in Fig. 10c, after CO 2 photoreduction, the signal of adsorbed H 2 O or CO 2 on the surface of P10-550 has much intensified, and a new peak at 531.2 eV ascribing to P-OH emerges, which is in accordance with the detection of P-OH bonding at 134.4 eV in the P 2p XPS of P10-550 Used (Fig. 10d). Prasetyanto et al. demonstrated that the combination of secondary and tertiary amine resulted in higher rate of CO 2 activation than single type amine species, and the formation of CO 2 -from adsorbed CO 2 was recognized to be the first step. 38,39 reover, the one lone electron of P atom bonded to N atoms can enhance the alkalinity of the nearby basic sites, which further promotes the adsorption and activation of CO 2 on the Pdoped CN (Fig. 4f).Due to the special chemical environment, the N atoms near bay site P atoms show higher activity in the CO 2 photoreduction process than other N atoms.Above all, we hereby attempt to propose a possible CO 2 reduction process on this P-doped CN photocatalyst (Fig. S5).During the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, the positive-charged P atoms will combine with hydroxide ion (OH -) forming the Lewis acid sites 40 .CO 2 adsorbed on the N atoms nearby transforms to radical CO 2 -by accepting an electron, which is proved by the in-situ FTIR results.Afterward, P-OH can form hydrogen bond with O atoms from CO 2 -, accelerating the dissociation of CO 2 -to CO.The P-OH structure is generated and exists in the entire CO 2 photoreduction process, as indicated by XPS and 31 P NMR results.The well-retained Lewis acid site P-OH after the CO 2 photoreduction process may play a good role in the next photocatalytic cycle, thus ensure the recyclability and stability of P10-550."}]}}
