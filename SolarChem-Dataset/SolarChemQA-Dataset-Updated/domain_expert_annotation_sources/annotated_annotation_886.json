CN was prepared by the urea method.Urea was heated with the heating rate of 0.5 o C/min in a semi-cover ceramic crucible.After the temperature increased to 550 o C, the crucible was heated for 3 hours at the constant temperature, and then slowly cooled to the room temperature naturally.Light-yellow powder was obtained and then ground into fine powder. CN was hydroxylated by the way of acid treatment.2 g of as-prepared CN powder was vigorously stirred for 1 hour in 150 mL 0.5 M nitric acid.Then, the suspension was treated under ultrasonication for 15 min for 3 cycles.Subsequently, the process of washing with water and ethanol was repeated for three cycles, and then vacuum drying at 60 o C. AA-functionalized CN (CN-AA).The preparation of AAfunctionalized CN was synthesized by two steps. 37The first step is the synthesis of the diazonium salt by the following procedure.7 mmol (280 mg) NaOH and 7 mmol (960 mg) AA were added into 80 mL water.7.6 mmol (526 mg) NaNO 2 was then added slowly in ice bath.Subsequently, the solution was added to 6 mL HCl solution (20, 6.4 M, 19.2 mmol) and stirred for 1 hour.The solution of phenyl carboxylic diazonium salt with pale-yellow colour was obtained.Then, the solution was filtered and washed for three times with deionized water and ethanol.The obtained powder was dried at 60 o C for 12 hours under vacuum.The second step is to add the prepared CN into the deionized water and then to ultrasound for 1 hour.After mixing the as-prepared diazonium salt and the CN suspension solution, the mixture was stirred for 4 hours in ice bath and then washed with distilled water, ethanol, DMF and acetone in sequence and repeated for three cycles.Finally, the filtered powder was dried at 60 o C for 12 hours under vacuum. NiMOF/CN-OH and NiMOF/CN-AA.The xNiMOF/CN-OH and xNiMOF/CN-AA nanocomposites (x is the weight ratio of NiMOF) was prepared under ultrasonic assistance.0.5 g CN-OH or CN-AA was dispersed completely into solvent of 30 mL DMF, 2 mL ethanol and 2 mL deionized water under ultrasound.Then, a certain amount of benzene-1,4-dicarboxylic acid (BDC) was dissolved into the mixed solution under the continuous ultrasonication.In this process, the BDC ligand could be dispersed onto the surface of CN-OH or CN-AA.Next, equimolar NiCl 2 6H 2 O was added and followed by stirring for 10 minutes.Subsequently, triethylamine (TEA) was quickly injected into the solution.The obtained solution was stirred for 5 minutes to obtain a uniform colloidal suspension which was continuously ultrasonicated for 8 h at airtight conditions.Scheme 1.

The X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples were conducted by using a Bruker D8 advance diffractometer with CuK radiation.The ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-Vis DRS) were tested on a Model Shimadzu UV2550 spectrophotometer referred by BaSO 4 .The Fouriertransform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were recorded with a Bruker Equiox 55 spectrometer with KBr as the diluents.The thickness of the samples was analysed by Atomic force microscopy (AFM) on a multimode nanoscope VIII instrument (Bruker) with mica as the base.Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images and data documented the morphology of the samples by using a FEI Tecnai G2 S-Twin instrument with 200 kV acceleration voltage.The surface photovoltage spectroscopy (SPS) measurements for samples were implemented on home-built apparatus, equipped with a lock-in amplifier (SR830, USA) synchronized with a light chopper (SR540, USA).The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements were conducted by Bruker EMX plus model spectrometer operating at the Xband frequency.The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out with Kratos-AXIS ULTRA DLD, in which Al (Mono) was the X-ray source.CO 2 TPD (Temperatureprogrammed desorption) was tested by Chemisorption Analyzer (Tp 5080 Chemisorb) with a TCD detector. The detection of hydroxyl radicals (OH) was carried out by coumarin fluorescence method.50 mL coumarin solution with a concentration of 110 -3 M was firstly prepared.0.05 g catalyst was added into the coumarin solution and stirred for 30 minutes, which ensured the realization of the adsorptiondesorption equilibrium.Upon irradiation for 1 h, the suspension was centrifuged and then transferred into a Pyrex glass cell.The fluorescence data was recorded by Perkin-Elmer LS55 spectrofluorometer.A 420 nm light filter was utilized to cut off UV light. Traditional three-electrode system was utilized to measure the photoelectrochemical (PEC) and electrochemical (EC) reduction.Except that the working electrode of the prepared sample, a platinum plate (99.9) and a saturated KCl Ag/AgCl electrode were used as counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively.During the experiments, 0.5 M Na 2 SO 4 solution as the electrolyte, and high purity nitrogen gas was bubbled.PEC experiments were performed in a quartz cell using a 300 W Xenon lamp with a cut-off filter ( 420 nm) as the illumination source.PEC and EC performance of a series of catalysts was tested in an IVIUM V13806 electrochemical workstation. The photocatalytic device contains a cylindrical steel reactor (100 mL volume and 3.5 cm 2 area), a light source (300 W Xenon arc lamp), and a gas system (high pure CO 2 ).Then, the reactor was added by a suspension solution of 0.1 g catalyst and 5 mL water.The CO 2 gas was passed through the water and then into the reaction setup.After reaching ambient pressure, the photocatalyst was equilibrated in the CO 2 /H 2 O system for 1 hour, following the irradiation for 4 h.During irradiation, 250 L gas produced was taken from the reaction cell at given time intervals for CO and CH 4 concentration analysis using a gas chromatograph (GC-7920 with TCD, Au Light, Beijing) and for O 2 concentration analysis using a gas chromatograph (GC-7900 with TCD, Perfect Light, Beijing)."}, {"llm generation": "NiMOF/CN-OH and NiMOF/CN-AA heterojunctions", "source": "In summary, dimension-matched NiMOF/CN-OH and NiMOF/CN-AA heterojunctions with CN-OH/AA-BDC-Ni interfacial connection have been successfully prepared by the way of in-situ growth with the ultrasonic assistance.These nanocomposites exhibited excellent photocatalytic activities for CO 2 RR to produce CO and CH 4 .", "context": "In summary, dimension-matched NiMOF/CN-OH and NiMOF/CN-AA heterojunctions with CN-OH/AA-BDC-Ni interfacial connection have been successfully prepared by the way of in-situ growth with the ultrasonic assistance.These nanocomposites exhibited excellent photocatalytic activities for CO 2 RR to produce CO and CH 4 .It was clearly that the exceptional photocatalytic activities mainly resulted from the favourable charge transport within ultrathin CN and coupled NiMOF nanosheets, and from the greatly-enhanced charge separation via the excited high-level electron transfer from CN to NiMOF in resultant intimately-contacted heterojunction caused by surface oxygen-containing functionalization and then by the provided catalytic functions of Ni clusters for CO 2 activation.In particular, it is quite important for all the structural factors such as the in-situ growth approach, ultrasonic assistance, good dispersibility, well-modulated interfaces and provided active sites for efficiently photocatalytic CO 2 RR.This work offers a unique insight into the CN-based heterojunction systems, which will be essential for the development of CO 2 photocatalysts.

As shown in Figure 1a, the XRD patterns showed that both 4NiMOF/CN-OH and 4NiMOF/CN-AA owned characteristic peaks of CN located at 13.1 o (100) and 27.3 o (002), indicating that the structure of CN was preserved during functionalization treatment and in-situ growth of NiMOF (Figure 1a). 40It was also observed in 4NiMOF/CN-OH and 4NiMOF/CN-AA that tiny peaks at 8.9 o , 14.1 o , 15.8 o , 17.8 o respectively reflected the (200), (001), ( 201) and (-201) planes of NiMOF (Figure S1). 41The weak XRD signals of NiMOF Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins resulted from the low weight ratio.The coexistence of the characteristic peaks respectively assigned to CN and NiMOF clearly confirmed the successful combination of two components.Noteworthily, the XRD peak at 8.9 o of 4NiMOF/CN-AA was obviously weaker than that of 4NiMOF/CN-OH, which implied the thinner morphology and better dispersibility of NiMOF nanosheets in 4NiMOF/CN-AA. 42,43iven the porous structure of NiMOF, the N 2 physisorption properties were investigated, as shown in Figure 1b.According to the classification by IUPAC, the N 2 isotherm of 4NiMOF/CN-OH and 4NiMOF/CN-AA were identified as type-II curves with H4-type hysteresis loops, simultaneously possessing the micropores in the NiMOF frameworks and the mesopores originating from the slit-like pores formed by stacking of nanosheets. 44As-measured Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of 4NiMOF/CN-OH and 4NiMOF/CN-AA were respectively 40.16 and 52.58 m 2 /g, much higher than the 35.14 m 2 /g of CN.These results on N 2 physisorption properties, along with the above XRD patterns, indicated that the microporous NiMOF is successfully introduced to construct nanocomposites with functionalized CN.In these nanocomposites, CN possessed UV-vis absorption with the edges at 460 nm (Figure S2).While the OH and AA functionalization and NiMOF coupling did not change the light absorption range.This was further verified by the UV-vis DRS spectrum of the single NiMOF nanosheets as fabricated by the controlled experiment that indiscernible absorption peak appeared in the visible region ( 420 nm).The band gap energies (E g ) of CN and NiMOF were accordingly calculated to be 2.7 eV and 3.6 eV, respectively.Thus, under the visible light the CN would act as the light absorber and photogenerated charge producer, and then transfer to the NiMOF nanosheets which could play significant roles on the accepting electrons to inhibit charge recombination and then execute catalytic behaviour.To better achieve this process, the NiMOF nanosheets should display good dispersibility and thinner morphology, which is beneficial for charge transfer among interfaces and NiMOF inner structures. AFM images depicted the 2D layer-like morphologies of the CN and functionalized CN with the lateral sizes from 0.5 to 3 m and with the corresponding heights of uniformly 4.6 nm (Figure S3).After growing NiMOF, the height of 4NiMOF/CN-AA reached to about 8.6 nm, with a 4.0 nm thicker than that of CN-AA and a 2.0 nm thinner than that of 4NiMOF/CN-OH.This result illustrated that 2D NiMOF nanosheets were grown on the surfaces of functionalized CN nanosheets.In other words, 4NiMOF/CN-OH and 4NiMOF/CN-AA were classified to the dimension-matched heterojunctions.Moreover, given the cell height of NiMOF is 1.0 nm, 30 the NiMOF in the 4NiMOF/CN-OH and 4NiMOF/CN-AA was estimated as six and four layers, respectively.Integrating the layer numbers and weight ratios, it could be inferred that AA functionalization benefited the uniformly dispersion of NiMOF on the surface of CN, which was consistent with the above-mentioned result on XRD patterns.Predictably, the thinner NiMOF nanosheet would be favourable for the charge separation and transfer. 27lectron microscope images unfolded more finely morphological features within micro-nano scales.In the TEM images, all the prepared samples featured on 2D sink-like structures, in which the edges were slightly curled (Figure 2 and S4).For the 4NiMOF/CN-OH and 4NiMOF/CN-AA, it was hard to obviously observe the existence of the bulky NiMOF, which stated that the good dispersibility, without obvious aggregation, of NiMOF on the surface of CN at sub-micrometre scale.Noteworthily, the NiMOF was clearly observed in the HRTEM images of 4NiMOF/CN-OH and 4NiMOF/CN-AA heterojunctions.Figure 2b presented the nanoscale morphology of 4NiMOF/CN-OH, in which NiMOF nanosheets were tightly adhered on the surface of CN-OH.Comparatively, the 4NiMOF/CN-AA presented better dispersibility with larger size and more uniform grayscale, both of which implied a high dispersion of NiMOF on the surface of CN-AA (Figure 2d).Predictably, the better dispersibility for 4NiMOF/CN-AA would be helpful for charge transfer from interface to the whole surface and provided more accessible active sites for the dimension-matched heterojunction photocatalysts. 27,45In addition, elemental mapping analysis further proved that 4NiMOF/CN-AA sample consisted of C, N, O and Ni elements (Figure 2e-2h).The dispersed Ni element confirmed that the NiMOF was uniformly dispersed on the CN surface.All above information on morphology indicated that the successful preparation of the dimension-matched heterojunctions by insitu growth of well-dispersed NiMOF onto the functionalized CN. The above information on morphology proved the successful preparation of the heterojunctions via in-situ growth of well-dispersed NiMOF nanosheets onto the functionalized CN.Besides, interfacial connection is another significant consideration to influence the efficiency of charge separation and transfer in the dimension-matched heterojunctions.Therefore, the FT-IR and XPS spectra of the prepared samples were tested to finely analyse the interfacial connection between CN and NiMOF.Figure 3a listed the FT-IR spectra of CN, CN-OH, CN-AA, 4NiMOF/CN-OH and 4NiMOF/CN-AA.All these samples exhibited similar profiles because of the low proportion of NiMOF and high coincidence on the characteristic peaks between CN and NiMOF.Still, valuably detailed information could be achieved through meticulous analysis.It could be obtained in the FT-IR spectrum of the CN-OH that the peak at 3040 cm -1 obviously strengthened and red-shifted after the hydroxylation, which demonstrated the successful introduction of the surface hydroxylic group on the CN. 46For CN-AA, two evidences certified the success of AA functionalization.The first one is that the red-shift of the peak at 1628 cm -1 , which was a symbol introducing carboxyl groups. 35,37Secondly, it was clearly emerged that two peaks at 2874 and 2890 cm -1 which attributed to the stretching vibration of C-H bond from the 1,4substituted benzene of AA. 47 In addition, the FT-IR spectra further revealed the connection approach between NiMOF and CN in both 4NiMOF/CN-OH and 4NiMOF/CN-AA.During the process of NiMOF growth, the BDC ligand and Ni 2 ion was introduced as a sequential order, so it could be inferred that the BDC ligand is preferably connected with the functionalized CN.If not, the broad peak of surface hydroxylic groups in the range of 3000-3200 cm -1 would obviously shift to 3600 cm -1 and be sharper under the coordination between Ni and CN-OH. 48However, it occurred a slight blue shift and no sharpness due to the H-bond between the carboxylic group of BDC ligand and functional group on CN.This was also verified by the XPS spectra.The N 1s peaks of CN were all shifted to lower binding energy, indicating that CN related to the NiMOF. 2 The Ni 2p spectra of 4NiMOF/CN-OH and 4NiMOF/CN-AA possessed Photophysical test with steady-state surface photovoltage spectroscopy (SS-SPS) is an eminent strategy to reflect the properties of photogenerated charge carrier, which was applied to examine as-synthesized samples.Generally, a stronger SS-SPS response reflects a more efficient charge separation.Among the NiMOF/CN-OH heterojunctions with different amounts of NiMOF, 4NiMOF/CN-OH demonstrated the strongest SS-SPS signal and thereby most efficient charge separation (Figure S5).With a lower NiMOF proportion, the quantity on charge transfer will be limited, while with a higher proportion, the quality will be negatively influenced by an aggregation of NiMOF.With the same loading amount of NiMOF, 4NiMOF/CN-AA showed further strengthened SS-SPS response in comparison to that for 4NiMOF/CN-OH, indicating the improved charge separation (Figure 4a).This mainly resulted from more dispersed and thinner NiMOF nanosheets formed by the induction of AA groups as well as the intermate interface, both of which could significantly facilitate the photogenerated charge transfer and separation. Photochemical analysis toward the amount of produced hydroxyl radicals (OH) could further verify the separation of photogenerated charge carriers in the photocatalytic process. 49 Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins OH to produce 7-hydroxyl-coumarin and emits an obvious luminescence at 430-550 nm.As shown in Figure 4a inset and S6, the orders of fluorescent intensities of NiMOF/CN-OH samples were well agreeable with the above photophysical results.In addition, the observed fluorescent intensity order was as follows: CN 4NiMOF/CN-OH 4NiMOF/CN-AA, which was also in good accordance with that of SS-SPS results. Integrating the results of photophysical and photochemical results, it could be concluded that the photogenerated charge transfer and separation was significantly improved after in-situ growth of 4 NiMOF onto functionalized CN, especially for CN-AA.Additionally, the transient photocurrent-time (I-t) curves supported the above results and further presented the stability of as-prepared photocatalysts (Figure S7). The photocatalytic activities for CO 2 RR were conducted under visible-light irradiation with a 420 nm cut-off filter.The reduction products, CH 4 and CO, and the oxidation product of O 2 were detected.As shown in Figure 4b and S8, the photoactivities on yielding CO, CH 4 and O 2 had low activities for CN, NiMOF and functonalized CN, but achieved significant enhancement when the NiMOF was grown on CN-OH and CN-AA.Among the serial heterojunctions with a proper amount of NiMOF, 4NiMOF/CN-OH displayed the highest photocatalytic performance due to the improvement on charge separation and transfer (Figure S8).Impressively, 4NiMOF/CN-AA exhibited the best photoactivity with a 11-fold and nearly 2fold enhancements, respectively, compared with CN and 4NiMOF/CN-OH.For all samples, the orders of photoactivities were consistent with those of photophysical and photochemical results, indicating the enhanced photoactivities would be tightly associated with better NiMOF dispersibility and improved charge separation. Compared with similar works as reported (Table S1) 23242526 , the photocatalytic activities of 4NiMOF/CN-AA in our study exhibited excellent performance for the aqueous CO 2 RR among the MOF/g-C 3 N 4 -based heterojunction photocatalysts.For the 4NiMOF/CN-AA, the amounts of evolved CH 4 and CO linearly increased with increasing the irradiation time, and there was nearly no activity loss after five-cycle reactions (Figure S9).These results reflected the stability nature of asfabricated heterojunction photocatalysts. As described above, the photocatalytic activities of CN can be greatly improved by in-situ growing NiMOF with the induction of OH or AA to obtain a series of NiMOF/CN heterojunction photocatalysts.This has been proved as the promoted charge transfer and separation caused by the matched 2D/2D structures and efficient interfacial connection between functionalized CN and NiMOF.This is further supported by electrochemical impedance spectra of three typical samples (Figure 5a).4NiMOF/CN-OH and 4NiMOF/CN-AA exhibited an obviously decreased capacitive arc radius compared with CN, implying that the charge recombination was inhibited by transferring the photogenerated electrons from CN to NiMOF.Moreover, 4NiMOF/CN-AA showed the smallest arc radius, which demonstrated that the welldispersed NiMOF on CN-AA had better charge transfer capacity. The charge separation might be attributed to the photoelectron transfer from CN to the as-grown NiMOF acting as an electron-accepting platform in the NiMOF/CN heterojunctions via the well-modulated intimate interfaces.To verify the possibility for CO 2 photoreduction, Mott-Schottky spectra of CN and NiMOF were carried out at the frequency of 500, 1000 and 1500 Hz (Figure S10).The resulted positive slopes of C 2 -E values (vs the applied potentials) was consistent with that of the typical n-type semiconductors, and the intersection at -1.46 eV for CN and -1.53 eV for NiMOF vs Ag/AgCl (i.e.-1.26 eV for CN and -1.33 eV for NiMOF vs NHE) was determined as the flat band position.Given that generally for the n-type semiconductor the bottom of the conduction band (CB) for CN or lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) for NiMOF is approximately equal to the flat-band potential, the CB of CN and the LUMO of NiMOF were determined as -1.26 eV and -1.33 eV vs NHE, respectively.With the bandgap energy provided by Tauc plot (Figure S2), the valence band (VB) of CN was calculated as 1.49eV, and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of NiMOF was 2.27 eV.Given the more negative potential of CN and NiMOF in the heterojunctions than the reduction potential of CO 2 reduction, it is theoretically feasible for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to CO and CH 4 .Because the energy position of the LUMO of NiMOF was slightly negative than the CB of CN, it was inferred that the electrons could transfer by the way of highlevel electron transfer. In order to verify this hypothesis, monochromatic photocurrent action spectra were thus examined.As shown in Figure 5b, the photocurrent density of 4NiMOF/CN-OH and 4NiMOF/CN-AA gradually increased as the excitation wavelength decreased from 460 to 400 nm with the step of 10 nm.Noticeably, it began to sharply increase under 440nm excitation, which was the threshold wavelength to facilitate the transfer of visible-light excited proper-energy electrons from CN to NiMOF.The difference between the absorption edge at 460 nm and the threshold wavelength at 440 nm verified that the photogenerated electrons should be excited to the higher energy level of the CB of CN so as to realize the photoelectron transfer.Subsequently, the low-temperature EPR technique was employed to explore the process of photoelectron transfer from CN to NiMOF (Figure 5c).The weak EPR signal of CN at g 2.001 was assigned to the unpaired electrons on conjugated CN aromatic rings. 23After growing NiMOF, this signal becomes stronger, especially for 4NiMOF/CN-AA.This indicated that the introduction of NiMOF efficiently inhibited the charge recombination and generated more free electrons.This well corresponded to the results of fluorescent spectra.It was remarkable that the unpaired electron in Ni (I) was directly observed for 4NiMOF/CN-OH and 4NiMOF/CN-AA.The signals at g 2.285 in the EPR spectra were attributed to the unpaired electron in the 3d x 2y 2 orbital of Ni. 43 Electrochemical reduction measurements were also performed to explore the mechanism of CO 2 conversion (Figure 5d andS11).In both of N 2 and CO 2 bubbled systems, the potential values had the order of 4NiMOF/CN-AA 4NiMOF/CN-OH CN.This result confirmed that both 4NiMOF/CN-OH and 4NiMOF/CN-AA were beneficial to improve the photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction.It also demonstrated that the NiMOF possessed catalytic potential. By comparison, the samples in CO 2 bubbled system had lower potential values than those in N 2 bubbled system, which illustrated that the reduction behaviour of CO 2 was also much preferred compared with H 2 O reduction.This indicated that the coupled NiMOF could provide good catalytic functions for CO 2 reduction, which was further supported by the promoted adsorption of CO 2 based on the CO 2 TPD spectra (Figure S12).Thus, it was deduced that specific central Ni(II) species in NiMOF/CN heterojunctions were the catalytic sites for activating CO 2 , hence facilitated the reduction by the photoelectrons. Based all above results, a schematic process has been proposed on high-energy-level electron transfer over dimension-matched intimate-contacted 4NiMOF/CN-OH and 4NiMOF/CN-AA heterojunction photocatalysts (Figure 6a).Under visible-light irradiation, the photogenerated electrons on CN were excited to the energy level higher than the CB, and then transferred to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of NiMOF via the CN-OH/AA-BDC-Ni interface.Subsequently, the Ni (II) species could accept the high-energylevel photoelectrons from the BDC ligand and then catalyse the CO 2 RR.In this case, the spatially-separated photogenerated holes on CN and electrons on NiMOF would possess sufficient thermodynamic energy to induce redox reactions, respectively, leading to the promoted charge separation and hence to the improved photocatalytic activities.Moreover, the photocatalytic activities for CO 2 conversion could be further improved under the irradiation of UV-visible light.As shown in Figure 6b, the photocatalytic activity on the total products of CO and CH 4 were 54.5 mol/g for 4NiMOF/CN-AA, an 18-fold improvement compared with that of CN.Compared with visible light irradiation, the activities under UV-vis irradiation possessed 6-fold improvement for both 4NiMOF/CN-OH and 4NiMOF/CN-AA.This greatly improvement further confirmed the as-proposed mechanism on high-electron-level electron transfer in that the electrons were excited to higher energy levels under UV irradiation and were more beneficial to electron transfer.Please do not adjust margins To clearly certify the influence on photoactivities by dimension matching, it was prepared in a control experiment that a reference sample, namely 4B-NiMOF/CN-AA, by in situ growing 4 bulky NiMOF onto the CN-AA under hydrothermal condition.Besides, 4CoMOF/CN-AA and 4ZnMOF/CN-AA were also prepared by substituting Ni 2 ions with Co 2 or Zn 2 ions during the process of in-situ growth.These reference samples had sharply decreased photoactivity for CO 2 conversion compared with 4NiMOF/CN-AA (Figure S13).The SS-SPS spectra certified the weak charge separation of 4B-NiMOF/CN-AA due to the thicker morphology and bad dispersibility (Figure S5).The electrochemical reduction spectra revealed the decreased catalytic capacities for 4CoMOF/CN-AA and 4ZnMOF/CN-AA due to their increased potential values as seen in Figure S14.These results further confirmed the excellent photocatalytic properties on CO 2 RR were due to the dimension-matched structures, well-modulated interfaces and introduced Ni active centres."}], "reactor type": [], "operation mode": [{"llm generation": "Batch", "source": "After reaching ambient pressure, the photocatalyst was equilibrated in the CO 2 /H 2 O system for 1 hour, following the irradiation for 4 h.

Traditional three-electrode system was utilized to measure the photoelectrochemical (PEC) and electrochemical (EC) reduction.Except that the working electrode of the prepared sample, a platinum plate (99.9) and a saturated KCl Ag/AgCl electrode were used as counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively.During the experiments, 0.5 M Na 2 SO 4 solution as the electrolyte, and high purity nitrogen gas was bubbled.PEC experiments were performed in a quartz cell using a 300 W Xenon lamp with a cut-off filter ( 420 nm) as the illumination source.PEC and EC performance of a series of catalysts was tested in an IVIUM V13806 electrochemical workstation.

As shown in Figure 1a, the XRD patterns showed that both 4NiMOF/CN-OH and 4NiMOF/CN-AA owned characteristic peaks of CN located at 13.1 o (100) and 27.3 o (002), indicating that the structure of CN was preserved during functionalization treatment and in-situ growth of NiMOF (Figure 1a). 40It was also observed in 4NiMOF/CN-OH and 4NiMOF/CN-AA that tiny peaks at 8.9 o , 14.1 o , 15.8 o , 17.8 o respectively reflected the (200), (001), ( 201) and (-201) planes of NiMOF (Figure S1). 41The weak XRD signals of NiMOF Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins resulted from the low weight ratio.The coexistence of the characteristic peaks respectively assigned to CN and NiMOF clearly confirmed the successful combination of two components.Noteworthily, the XRD peak at 8.9 o of 4NiMOF/CN-AA was obviously weaker than that of 4NiMOF/CN-OH, which implied the thinner morphology and better dispersibility of NiMOF nanosheets in 4NiMOF/CN-AA. 42,43iven the porous structure of NiMOF, the N 2 physisorption properties were investigated, as shown in Figure 1b.According to the classification by IUPAC, the N 2 isotherm of 4NiMOF/CN-OH and 4NiMOF/CN-AA were identified as type-II curves with H4-type hysteresis loops, simultaneously possessing the micropores in the NiMOF frameworks and the mesopores originating from the slit-like pores formed by stacking of nanosheets. 44As-measured Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of 4NiMOF/CN-OH and 4NiMOF/CN-AA were respectively 40.16 and 52.58 m 2 /g, much higher than the 35.14 m 2 /g of CN.These results on N 2 physisorption properties, along with the above XRD patterns, indicated that the microporous NiMOF is successfully introduced to construct nanocomposites with functionalized CN.In these nanocomposites, CN possessed UV-vis absorption with the edges at 460 nm (Figure S2).While the OH and AA functionalization and NiMOF coupling did not change the light absorption range.This was further verified by the UV-vis DRS spectrum of the single NiMOF nanosheets as fabricated by the controlled experiment that indiscernible absorption peak appeared in the visible region ( 420 nm).The band gap energies (E g ) of CN and NiMOF were accordingly calculated to be 2.7 eV and 3.6 eV, respectively.Thus, under the visible light the CN would act as the light absorber and photogenerated charge producer, and then transfer to the NiMOF nanosheets which could play significant roles on the accepting electrons to inhibit charge recombination and then execute catalytic behaviour.To better achieve this process, the NiMOF nanosheets should display good dispersibility and thinner morphology, which is beneficial for charge transfer among interfaces and NiMOF inner structures. AFM images depicted the 2D layer-like morphologies of the CN and functionalized CN with the lateral sizes from 0.5 to 3 m and with the corresponding heights of uniformly 4.6 nm (Figure S3).After growing NiMOF, the height of 4NiMOF/CN-AA reached to about 8.6 nm, with a 4.0 nm thicker than that of CN-AA and a 2.0 nm thinner than that of 4NiMOF/CN-OH.This result illustrated that 2D NiMOF nanosheets were grown on the surfaces of functionalized CN nanosheets.In other words, 4NiMOF/CN-OH and 4NiMOF/CN-AA were classified to the dimension-matched heterojunctions.Moreover, given the cell height of NiMOF is 1.0 nm, 30 the NiMOF in the 4NiMOF/CN-OH and 4NiMOF/CN-AA was estimated as six and four layers, respectively.Integrating the layer numbers and weight ratios, it could be inferred that AA functionalization benefited the uniformly dispersion of NiMOF on the surface of CN, which was consistent with the above-mentioned result on XRD patterns.Predictably, the thinner NiMOF nanosheet would be favourable for the charge separation and transfer. 27lectron microscope images unfolded more finely morphological features within micro-nano scales.In the TEM images, all the prepared samples featured on 2D sink-like structures, in which the edges were slightly curled (Figure 2 and S4).For the 4NiMOF/CN-OH and 4NiMOF/CN-AA, it was hard to obviously observe the existence of the bulky NiMOF, which stated that the good dispersibility, without obvious aggregation, of NiMOF on the surface of CN at sub-micrometre scale.Noteworthily, the NiMOF was clearly observed in the HRTEM images of 4NiMOF/CN-OH and 4NiMOF/CN-AA heterojunctions.Figure 2b presented the nanoscale morphology of 4NiMOF/CN-OH, in which NiMOF nanosheets were tightly adhered on the surface of CN-OH.Comparatively, the 4NiMOF/CN-AA presented better dispersibility with larger size and more uniform grayscale, both of which implied a high dispersion of NiMOF on the surface of CN-AA (Figure 2d).Predictably, the better dispersibility for 4NiMOF/CN-AA would be helpful for charge transfer from interface to the whole surface and provided more accessible active sites for the dimension-matched heterojunction photocatalysts. 27,45In addition, elemental mapping analysis further proved that 4NiMOF/CN-AA sample consisted of C, N, O and Ni elements (Figure 2e-2h).The dispersed Ni element confirmed that the NiMOF was uniformly dispersed on the CN surface.All above information on morphology indicated that the successful preparation of the dimension-matched heterojunctions by insitu growth of well-dispersed NiMOF onto the functionalized CN. The above information on morphology proved the successful preparation of the heterojunctions via in-situ growth of well-dispersed NiMOF nanosheets onto the functionalized CN.Besides, interfacial connection is another significant consideration to influence the efficiency of charge separation and transfer in the dimension-matched heterojunctions.Therefore, the FT-IR and XPS spectra of the prepared samples were tested to finely analyse the interfacial connection between CN and NiMOF.Figure 3a listed the FT-IR spectra of CN, CN-OH, CN-AA, 4NiMOF/CN-OH and 4NiMOF/CN-AA.All these samples exhibited similar profiles because of the low proportion of NiMOF and high coincidence on the characteristic peaks between CN and NiMOF.Still, valuably detailed information could be achieved through meticulous analysis.It could be obtained in the FT-IR spectrum of the CN-OH that the peak at 3040 cm -1 obviously strengthened and red-shifted after the hydroxylation, which demonstrated the successful introduction of the surface hydroxylic group on the CN. 46For CN-AA, two evidences certified the success of AA functionalization.The first one is that the red-shift of the peak at 1628 cm -1 , which was a symbol introducing carboxyl groups. 35,37Secondly, it was clearly emerged that two peaks at 2874 and 2890 cm -1 which attributed to the stretching vibration of C-H bond from the 1,4substituted benzene of AA. 47 In addition, the FT-IR spectra further revealed the connection approach between NiMOF and CN in both 4NiMOF/CN-OH and 4NiMOF/CN-AA.During the process of NiMOF growth, the BDC ligand and Ni 2 ion was introduced as a sequential order, so it could be inferred that the BDC ligand is preferably connected with the functionalized CN.If not, the broad peak of surface hydroxylic groups in the range of 3000-3200 cm -1 would obviously shift to 3600 cm -1 and be sharper under the coordination between Ni and CN-OH. 48However, it occurred a slight blue shift and no sharpness due to the H-bond between the carboxylic group of BDC ligand and functional group on CN.This was also verified by the XPS spectra.The N 1s peaks of CN were all shifted to lower binding energy, indicating that CN related to the NiMOF. 2 The Ni 2p spectra of 4NiMOF/CN-OH and 4NiMOF/CN-AA possessed Photophysical test with steady-state surface photovoltage spectroscopy (SS-SPS) is an eminent strategy to reflect the properties of photogenerated charge carrier, which was applied to examine as-synthesized samples.Generally, a stronger SS-SPS response reflects a more efficient charge separation.Among the NiMOF/CN-OH heterojunctions with different amounts of NiMOF, 4NiMOF/CN-OH demonstrated the strongest SS-SPS signal and thereby most efficient charge separation (Figure S5).With a lower NiMOF proportion, the quantity on charge transfer will be limited, while with a higher proportion, the quality will be negatively influenced by an aggregation of NiMOF.With the same loading amount of NiMOF, 4NiMOF/CN-AA showed further strengthened SS-SPS response in comparison to that for 4NiMOF/CN-OH, indicating the improved charge separation (Figure 4a).This mainly resulted from more dispersed and thinner NiMOF nanosheets formed by the induction of AA groups as well as the intermate interface, both of which could significantly facilitate the photogenerated charge transfer and separation. Photochemical analysis toward the amount of produced hydroxyl radicals (OH) could further verify the separation of photogenerated charge carriers in the photocatalytic process. 49 Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins OH to produce 7-hydroxyl-coumarin and emits an obvious luminescence at 430-550 nm.As shown in Figure 4a inset and S6, the orders of fluorescent intensities of NiMOF/CN-OH samples were well agreeable with the above photophysical results.In addition, the observed fluorescent intensity order was as follows: CN 4NiMOF/CN-OH 4NiMOF/CN-AA, which was also in good accordance with that of SS-SPS results. Integrating the results of photophysical and photochemical results, it could be concluded that the photogenerated charge transfer and separation was significantly improved after in-situ growth of 4 NiMOF onto functionalized CN, especially for CN-AA.Additionally, the transient photocurrent-time (I-t) curves supported the above results and further presented the stability of as-prepared photocatalysts (Figure S7). The photocatalytic activities for CO 2 RR were conducted under visible-light irradiation with a 420 nm cut-off filter.The reduction products, CH 4 and CO, and the oxidation product of O 2 were detected.As shown in Figure 4b and S8, the photoactivities on yielding CO, CH 4 and O 2 had low activities for CN, NiMOF and functonalized CN, but achieved significant enhancement when the NiMOF was grown on CN-OH and CN-AA.Among the serial heterojunctions with a proper amount of NiMOF, 4NiMOF/CN-OH displayed the highest photocatalytic performance due to the improvement on charge separation and transfer (Figure S8).Impressively, 4NiMOF/CN-AA exhibited the best photoactivity with a 11-fold and nearly 2fold enhancements, respectively, compared with CN and 4NiMOF/CN-OH.For all samples, the orders of photoactivities were consistent with those of photophysical and photochemical results, indicating the enhanced photoactivities would be tightly associated with better NiMOF dispersibility and improved charge separation. Compared with similar works as reported (Table S1) 23242526 , the photocatalytic activities of 4NiMOF/CN-AA in our study exhibited excellent performance for the aqueous CO 2 RR among the MOF/g-C 3 N 4 -based heterojunction photocatalysts.For the 4NiMOF/CN-AA, the amounts of evolved CH 4 and CO linearly increased with increasing the irradiation time, and there was nearly no activity loss after five-cycle reactions (Figure S9).These results reflected the stability nature of asfabricated heterojunction photocatalysts. As described above, the photocatalytic activities of CN can be greatly improved by in-situ growing NiMOF with the induction of OH or AA to obtain a series of NiMOF/CN heterojunction photocatalysts.This has been proved as the promoted charge transfer and separation caused by the matched 2D/2D structures and efficient interfacial connection between functionalized CN and NiMOF.This is further supported by electrochemical impedance spectra of three typical samples (Figure 5a).4NiMOF/CN-OH and 4NiMOF/CN-AA exhibited an obviously decreased capacitive arc radius compared with CN, implying that the charge recombination was inhibited by transferring the photogenerated electrons from CN to NiMOF.Moreover, 4NiMOF/CN-AA showed the smallest arc radius, which demonstrated that the welldispersed NiMOF on CN-AA had better charge transfer capacity. The charge separation might be attributed to the photoelectron transfer from CN to the as-grown NiMOF acting as an electron-accepting platform in the NiMOF/CN heterojunctions via the well-modulated intimate interfaces.To verify the possibility for CO 2 photoreduction, Mott-Schottky spectra of CN and NiMOF were carried out at the frequency of 500, 1000 and 1500 Hz (Figure S10).The resulted positive slopes of C 2 -E values (vs the applied potentials) was consistent with that of the typical n-type semiconductors, and the intersection at -1.46 eV for CN and -1.53 eV for NiMOF vs Ag/AgCl (i.e.-1.26 eV for CN and -1.33 eV for NiMOF vs NHE) was determined as the flat band position.Given that generally for the n-type semiconductor the bottom of the conduction band (CB) for CN or lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) for NiMOF is approximately equal to the flat-band potential, the CB of CN and the LUMO of NiMOF were determined as -1.26 eV and -1.33 eV vs NHE, respectively.With the bandgap energy provided by Tauc plot (Figure S2), the valence band (VB) of CN was calculated as 1.49eV, and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of NiMOF was 2.27 eV.Given the more negative potential of CN and NiMOF in the heterojunctions than the reduction potential of CO 2 reduction, it is theoretically feasible for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to CO and CH 4 .Because the energy position of the LUMO of NiMOF was slightly negative than the CB of CN, it was inferred that the electrons could transfer by the way of highlevel electron transfer. In order to verify this hypothesis, monochromatic photocurrent action spectra were thus examined.As shown in Figure 5b, the photocurrent density of 4NiMOF/CN-OH and 4NiMOF/CN-AA gradually increased as the excitation wavelength decreased from 460 to 400 nm with the step of 10 nm.Noticeably, it began to sharply increase under 440nm excitation, which was the threshold wavelength to facilitate the transfer of visible-light excited proper-energy electrons from CN to NiMOF.The difference between the absorption edge at 460 nm and the threshold wavelength at 440 nm verified that the photogenerated electrons should be excited to the higher energy level of the CB of CN so as to realize the photoelectron transfer.Subsequently, the low-temperature EPR technique was employed to explore the process of photoelectron transfer from CN to NiMOF (Figure 5c).The weak EPR signal of CN at g 2.001 was assigned to the unpaired electrons on conjugated CN aromatic rings. 23After growing NiMOF, this signal becomes stronger, especially for 4NiMOF/CN-AA.This indicated that the introduction of NiMOF efficiently inhibited the charge recombination and generated more free electrons.This well corresponded to the results of fluorescent spectra.It was remarkable that the unpaired electron in Ni (I) was directly observed for 4NiMOF/CN-OH and 4NiMOF/CN-AA.The signals at g 2.285 in the EPR spectra were attributed to the unpaired electron in the 3d x 2y 2 orbital of Ni. 43 Electrochemical reduction measurements were also performed to explore the mechanism of CO 2 conversion (Figure 5d andS11).In both of N 2 and CO 2 bubbled systems, the potential values had the order of 4NiMOF/CN-AA 4NiMOF/CN-OH CN.This result confirmed that both 4NiMOF/CN-OH and 4NiMOF/CN-AA were beneficial to improve the photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction.It also demonstrated that the NiMOF possessed catalytic potential. By comparison, the samples in CO 2 bubbled system had lower potential values than those in N 2 bubbled system, which illustrated that the reduction behaviour of CO 2 was also much preferred compared with H 2 O reduction.This indicated that the coupled NiMOF could provide good catalytic functions for CO 2 reduction, which was further supported by the promoted adsorption of CO 2 based on the CO 2 TPD spectra (Figure S12).Thus, it was deduced that specific central Ni(II) species in NiMOF/CN heterojunctions were the catalytic sites for activating CO 2 , hence facilitated the reduction by the photoelectrons. Based all above results, a schematic process has been proposed on high-energy-level electron transfer over dimension-matched intimate-contacted 4NiMOF/CN-OH and 4NiMOF/CN-AA heterojunction photocatalysts (Figure 6a).Under visible-light irradiation, the photogenerated electrons on CN were excited to the energy level higher than the CB, and then transferred to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of NiMOF via the CN-OH/AA-BDC-Ni interface.Subsequently, the Ni (II) species could accept the high-energylevel photoelectrons from the BDC ligand and then catalyse the CO 2 RR.In this case, the spatially-separated photogenerated holes on CN and electrons on NiMOF would possess sufficient thermodynamic energy to induce redox reactions, respectively, leading to the promoted charge separation and hence to the improved photocatalytic activities.Moreover, the photocatalytic activities for CO 2 conversion could be further improved under the irradiation of UV-visible light.As shown in Figure 6b, the photocatalytic activity on the total products of CO and CH 4 were 54.5 mol/g for 4NiMOF/CN-AA, an 18-fold improvement compared with that of CN.Compared with visible light irradiation, the activities under UV-vis irradiation possessed 6-fold improvement for both 4NiMOF/CN-OH and 4NiMOF/CN-AA.This greatly improvement further confirmed the as-proposed mechanism on high-electron-level electron transfer in that the electrons were excited to higher energy levels under UV irradiation and were more beneficial to electron transfer.Please do not adjust margins To clearly certify the influence on photoactivities by dimension matching, it was prepared in a control experiment that a reference sample, namely 4B-NiMOF/CN-AA, by in situ growing 4 bulky NiMOF onto the CN-AA under hydrothermal condition.Besides, 4CoMOF/CN-AA and 4ZnMOF/CN-AA were also prepared by substituting Ni 2 ions with Co 2 or Zn 2 ions during the process of in-situ growth.These reference samples had sharply decreased photoactivity for CO 2 conversion compared with 4NiMOF/CN-AA (Figure S13).The SS-SPS spectra certified the weak charge separation of 4B-NiMOF/CN-AA due to the thicker morphology and bad dispersibility (Figure S5).The electrochemical reduction spectra revealed the decreased catalytic capacities for 4CoMOF/CN-AA and 4ZnMOF/CN-AA due to their increased potential values as seen in Figure S14.These results further confirmed the excellent photocatalytic properties on CO 2 RR were due to the dimension-matched structures, well-modulated interfaces and introduced Ni active centres."}]}}
