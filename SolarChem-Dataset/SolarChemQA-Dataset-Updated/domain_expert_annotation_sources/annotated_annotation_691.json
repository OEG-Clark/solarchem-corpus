In the P 2p XPS spectrum (Fig. 2a) of BPg-C 3 N 4 , P peaks at 129.3, 130.1 and 133.1 eV can be discerned.The ratio of the peaks at 129.3 and 130.1 eV, assigned to the P 2p 3/2 and P 2p 1/2 , is 2:1.The peak at 133.1 eV is assigned to an oxidized phosphorus species (P x O y ), respectively 30,353637.Due to the shorter core hole lifetime of the oxidized species, the P 2p 3/2 and P 2p 1/2 signals for the oxidized species are much broader and not as well resolved as the elemental phosphorus peaks.The O 1s signal intensified slightly on going from g-C 3 N 4 to BPg-C 3 N 4 , further evidences that the BPQDs were partially oxidized (Fig. 2b).The XPS is consistent with surface passivation of the BPQDs by a thin oxide layer.Fig. 2c showed the N 1s XPS spectra for g-C 3 N 4 , which can be deconvoluted into subbands at 398.7, 399.4,400.9 and 405.0 eV.These peaks are typical for g-C 3 N 4 , and readily assigned as sp 2 hybridized aromatic N (C-NC), tertiary N bonded to carbon atoms (e. g., N-(C) 3 or H-N-(C) 2 ), quaternary N bonded to three carbon atoms in the aromatic rings 30,38,39 and - transitions of the CN heterocycles.For BPg-C 3 N 4 , the same N 1s XPS features were observed, albeit shifted to slightly lower binding energy possibly due to interaction between BPQD and g-C 3 N 4 via P-N coordinate bonds. 31P solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was used to probe P coordination in BPg-C 3 N 4 .As shown in Fig. 1b, BPg-C 3 N 4 gave three signals with chemical shifts of 0.4 ppm, 2.1 ppm and 8.3 ppm.The peak at 8.3 ppm is characteristic for P-P bonding in crystalline BP.The other two peaks (0.4 ppm, 2.1 ppm) were assigned to P-N coordinate bonds (or possibly P-O bonds) in the BPg-C 3 N 4 30.Solid state 13 C NMR spectra (Fig. S1) and C 1s XPS spectra (Fig. 2d) were also collected to explore the possibility of P-C coordinate bond formation in the composites.Deposition of BPQDs on g-C 3 N 4 did not change the 13 C NMR spectrum (Fig. S1) or the C 1s XPS spectrum (Fig. 2d) of g-C 3 N 4 .This suggests that the interaction of BPQDs with g-C 3 N 4 occurs via P-N coordinate bonding rather than P-C coordinate bonding.Fig. 1c shows a HRTEM image of BPg-C 3 N 4 .The diameter of the individual BPQDs was approximately 5 nm.Furthermore, the spacing of the lattice fringes was 0.21 nm, which can readily be indexed to (002) facets of BPQD (Fig. S2).The HRTEM image confirms BPQDs were successfully fabricated on g-C 3 N 4 surface.The BPQDs loading was too low to be detected in the EDS phosphorus map of BPg-C 3 N 4 (Fig. 1d), though a uniform distribution of C and N was found as expected for a g-C 3 N 4 support. The performance of BPg-C 3 N 4 composites with different BPQDs loadings were subsequently evaluated for photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .CO evolution rates for g-C 3 N 4 and BPg-C 3 N 4 composites under Xenon lamp irradiation (UV-vis light) for 4 h are shown in Fig. 3.The BPg-C 3 N 4 composites with 1 wt BPQDs loading demonstrated the highest activity for the reduction of CO 2 (6.54 mol g -1 h -1 ) with a small amount of CH 4 forming (0.29 mol g -1 h -1 ).The rate of CO evolution was more than 3 times higher than that for pure g-C 3 N 4 (2.65 mol g -1 h -1 ) under the same testing conditions, confirming that BPQDs addition was beneficial for enhancing the photocatalytic activity of g-C 3 N 4 .The photocatalytic cyclic experiment of CO 2 reduction also proved the stabilization of BPg-C 3 N 4 (Fig. S3).Table 1 compares the performance of various g-C 3 N 4 based photocatalysts for CO 2 conversion 404142434445.The metal free BPg-C 3 N 4 composites afford activities comparable to different metal-containing g-C 3 N 4 -based photocatalysts for CO 2 reduction to CO. In order to understand how BPQDs enhance the photocatalytic activity of g-C 3 N 4 for CO 2 reduction, the charge transfer in the BPg-C 3 N 4 composites were systematically examined.BPg-C 3 N 4 had higher photocurrent response (Fig. 4a) and smaller Nyquist arc radius (Fig. 4b) than g-C 3 N 4 , indicating that BPQDs enhanced light absorption, electron transfer and carrier separation efficiency of g-C 3 N 4 .To verify this assumption, time-resolved fluorescence spectra and transient absorption spectra measurements were carried out (Fig. 4c,d).The lifetime of photo-generated carriers in BPg-C 3 N 4 (4.39 ns) was longer than that in g-C 3 N 4 (3.10 ns).The longer electronic relaxation time of BPg-C 3 N 4 reflects a superior separation efficiency of photo-generated carriers.In addition, transient absorption spectra (Fig. 4d) revealed that loading BPQDs on g-C 3 N 4 resulted in a lower photo-generated carrier concentration and longer decay time (0.23 s for BPg-C 3 N 4 and 0.11 s for g-C 3 N 4 ).This confirmed that BPQDs enhanced the separation efficiency of photo-generated carriers and the utilization rate of electrons, and thereby accelerated electron transfer to adsorbed molecules (e.g., CO 2 and H 2 O) 46,47.Fig. S4 shows UV-vis DRS for g-C 3 N 4 and BPg-C 3 N 4 .After loading BPQDs on g-C 3 N 4 , the absorption band edge of g-C 3 N 4 did not change significantly, implying that BPQDs did not improve the photon absorption efficiency.Based on the above discussion, BPQDs led to enhancing carrier separation and utilization efficiency of g-C 3 N 4 rather than improving the photon absorption efficiency. Our previous studies found that singlet oxygen ( 1 O 2 ) and superoxide radicals (O 2 -) were mainly generated from O 2 during the exciton and carrier photocatalytic process, respectively 47,48.The exciton effect plays an important role in photocatalytic process.Generally speaking, the more the singlet oxygen that is generated in a photocatalytic process, the stronger the electron-hole interactions occurring in the bulk of the photocatalysts.As a result, suppressing the excitonic effect and increasing exciton dissociation in the photocatalytic process are an effective strategy to increase the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction ability.Higher O 2 -formation rate of BPg-C 3 N 4 than g-C 3 N 4 (Fig. 5a,b) confirmed that BP improved the carrier photocatalytic process of g-C 3 N 4 and showed that g-C 3 N 4 displayed a better rate of 1 O 2 generation compared with BPg-C 3 N 4 (Fig. 5c,d), indicating that BPQDs accelerated exciton dissociation in g-C 3 N 4 .ESR was used to quantify 1 O 2 and O 2 -generation on g-C 3 N 4 and BPg-C 3 N 4 .The trapping agents 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine (TEMP) and 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) were used to detect the 1 O 2 and O 2 -, respectively, formed during the photocatalytic process 4748495051.As shown in Fig. 5e, 1 O 2 was generated during the photoexcitation of the samples, evidenced by a 1:1:1 triplet signal with typical g-value of 2.001 and hyperfine splitting constant a N 1.608 mT for 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-N-oxyl (TEMPO).Less 1 O 2 was formed after loading BPQDs on g-C 3 N 4 (Fig. 5f).Conversely, more O 2 -was detected after loading BPQDs on g-C 3 N 4 , evidenced by the sextet ESR signal of DMPO-OOH, a spin adduct derived from DMPO-O 2 -.The ESR spectra thus support the findings from the time dependent absorption spectra of TMB oxidation for g-C 3 N 4 and BPg-C 3 N 4 .The exciton photocatalytic process was suppressed and the carrier photocatalytic process was enhanced after loading BPQDs on g-C 3 N 4 .Accordingly, BPQDs/g-C 3 N 4 composites show improved carrier separation, electron utilization efficiency and CO 2 reduction performance compared to g-C 3 N 4 ."}, {"llm generation": "UV-Vis", "source": "In summary, BPQDs modified g-C 3 N 4 photocatalysts show excellent activity for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to CO under UV-vis excitation, with the optimum BPQDs loading being approximately 1 wt.", "context": "In summary, BPQDs modified g-C 3 N 4 photocatalysts show excellent activity for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to CO under UV-vis excitation, with the optimum BPQDs loading being approximately 1 wt.Time-resolved PL spectra, transient photocurrent and ESR data revealed that BPg-C 3 N 4 composites had higher carrier separation efficiency and electronic utilization compared with g-C 3 N 4 .This strategy offers a new pathway for the development of efficient, low cost, metal free photocatalysts for CO 2 reduction and other applications.

Photoelectrochemical measurements 50 mg of photocatalyst was mixed with terpineol, and the resulting slurries coated on FTO glass electrodes by spin coating and then dried in an oven at 80C.The coated FTO glass electrodes were then tested on a CHI660E electrochemical workstation equipped with a Ag/AgCl reference electrode and a Pt counter electrode.A 50 mmol L -1 Na 2 SO 4 solution was used as the electrolyte and a 300 W Xe lamp as the light source.Characterization X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded at room temperature on a Bruker D8 advance X-ray diffractometer using Cu K radiation and a 2 scan rate of 6min -1 .Diffraction patterns were taken over the 2 range of 5-80.Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) maps were obtained on a JEOL JEM-2100F (URH) field emission transmission electron microscope.X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data was collected on a Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250XI X ray Photoelectron Spectrometer (Al K, 150 W, C 1s 284.8 eV).UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were obtained using UV-vis spectra (Perkin Elmer, Lambda 650s) using BaSO 4 as a reference).Time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) spectra and luminescence spectra (387 nm excitation) were recorded on a FLS920 Multifunction Steady State and Transient State Fluorescence Spectrometer (Edinburgh Instruments, room temperature).Transient absorption spectra were recorded at 365 nm on a NTAS transient state absorption spectrometer (Beijing Perfect light Technology Co., Ltd., China). 13C and 31 P solid state NMR spectra for g-C 3 N 4 and BPg-C 3 N 4 were obtained on a Bruker Avance III 400 M solid nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer."}, {"llm generation": "Xenon", "source": "CO evolution rates for g-C 3 N 4 and BPg-C 3 N 4 composites under Xenon lamp irradiation (UV-vis light) for 4 h are shown in Fig. 3.", "context": "Fig. 1a shows XRD patterns for g-C 3 N 4 and a BPg-C 3 N 4 composite (containing 1 wt BPQDs).For the BPg-C 3 N 4 composite, a strong peak at 27.7 o was observed, typical for the interlayer stacking reflection in g-C 3 N 4 .No peaks due to BPQDs were detected consistent with the low loading (1 wt).To verify the existence of BP in the BPg-C 3 N 4 composite, XPS was used.XPS spectra for g-C 3 N 4 and BPg-C 3 N 4 are shown in Fig. 2. In the P 2p XPS spectrum (Fig. 2a) of BPg-C 3 N 4 , P peaks at 129.3, 130.1 and 133.1 eV can be discerned.The ratio of the peaks at 129.3 and 130.1 eV, assigned to the P 2p 3/2 and P 2p 1/2 , is 2:1.The peak at 133.1 eV is assigned to an oxidized phosphorus species (P x O y ), respectively 30,353637.Due to the shorter core hole lifetime of the oxidized species, the P 2p 3/2 and P 2p 1/2 signals for the oxidized species are much broader and not as well resolved as the elemental phosphorus peaks.The O 1s signal intensified slightly on going from g-C 3 N 4 to BPg-C 3 N 4 , further evidences that the BPQDs were partially oxidized (Fig. 2b).The XPS is consistent with surface passivation of the BPQDs by a thin oxide layer.Fig. 2c showed the N 1s XPS spectra for g-C 3 N 4 , which can be deconvoluted into subbands at 398.7, 399.4,400.9 and 405.0 eV.These peaks are typical for g-C 3 N 4 , and readily assigned as sp 2 hybridized aromatic N (C-NC), tertiary N bonded to carbon atoms (e. g., N-(C) 3 or H-N-(C) 2 ), quaternary N bonded to three carbon atoms in the aromatic rings 30,38,39 and - transitions of the CN heterocycles.For BPg-C 3 N 4 , the same N 1s XPS features were observed, albeit shifted to slightly lower binding energy possibly due to interaction between BPQD and g-C 3 N 4 via P-N coordinate bonds. 31P solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was used to probe P coordination in BPg-C 3 N 4 .As shown in Fig. 1b, BPg-C 3 N 4 gave three signals with chemical shifts of 0.4 ppm, 2.1 ppm and 8.3 ppm.The peak at 8.3 ppm is characteristic for P-P bonding in crystalline BP.The other two peaks (0.4 ppm, 2.1 ppm) were assigned to P-N coordinate bonds (or possibly P-O bonds) in the BPg-C 3 N 4 30.Solid state 13 C NMR spectra (Fig. S1) and C 1s XPS spectra (Fig. 2d) were also collected to explore the possibility of P-C coordinate bond formation in the composites.Deposition of BPQDs on g-C 3 N 4 did not change the 13 C NMR spectrum (Fig. S1) or the C 1s XPS spectrum (Fig. 2d) of g-C 3 N 4 .This suggests that the interaction of BPQDs with g-C 3 N 4 occurs via P-N coordinate bonding rather than P-C coordinate bonding.Fig. 1c shows a HRTEM image of BPg-C 3 N 4 .The diameter of the individual BPQDs was approximately 5 nm.Furthermore, the spacing of the lattice fringes was 0.21 nm, which can readily be indexed to (002) facets of BPQD (Fig. S2).The HRTEM image confirms BPQDs were successfully fabricated on g-C 3 N 4 surface.The BPQDs loading was too low to be detected in the EDS phosphorus map of BPg-C 3 N 4 (Fig. 1d), though a uniform distribution of C and N was found as expected for a g-C 3 N 4 support. The performance of BPg-C 3 N 4 composites with different BPQDs loadings were subsequently evaluated for photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .CO evolution rates for g-C 3 N 4 and BPg-C 3 N 4 composites under Xenon lamp irradiation (UV-vis light) for 4 h are shown in Fig. 3.The BPg-C 3 N 4 composites with 1 wt BPQDs loading demonstrated the highest activity for the reduction of CO 2 (6.54 mol g -1 h -1 ) with a small amount of CH 4 forming (0.29 mol g -1 h -1 ).The rate of CO evolution was more than 3 times higher than that for pure g-C 3 N 4 (2.65 mol g -1 h -1 ) under the same testing conditions, confirming that BPQDs addition was beneficial for enhancing the photocatalytic activity of g-C 3 N 4 .The photocatalytic cyclic experiment of CO 2 reduction also proved the stabilization of BPg-C 3 N 4 (Fig. S3).Table 1 compares the performance of various g-C 3 N 4 based photocatalysts for CO 2 conversion 404142434445.The metal free BPg-C 3 N 4 composites afford activities comparable to different metal-containing g-C 3 N 4 -based photocatalysts for CO 2 reduction to CO. In order to understand how BPQDs enhance the photocatalytic activity of g-C 3 N 4 for CO 2 reduction, the charge transfer in the BPg-C 3 N 4 composites were systematically examined.BPg-C 3 N 4 had higher photocurrent response (Fig. 4a) and smaller Nyquist arc radius (Fig. 4b) than g-C 3 N 4 , indicating that BPQDs enhanced light absorption, electron transfer and carrier separation efficiency of g-C 3 N 4 .To verify this assumption, time-resolved fluorescence spectra and transient absorption spectra measurements were carried out (Fig. 4c,d).The lifetime of photo-generated carriers in BPg-C 3 N 4 (4.39 ns) was longer than that in g-C 3 N 4 (3.10 ns).The longer electronic relaxation time of BPg-C 3 N 4 reflects a superior separation efficiency of photo-generated carriers.In addition, transient absorption spectra (Fig. 4d) revealed that loading BPQDs on g-C 3 N 4 resulted in a lower photo-generated carrier concentration and longer decay time (0.23 s for BPg-C 3 N 4 and 0.11 s for g-C 3 N 4 ).This confirmed that BPQDs enhanced the separation efficiency of photo-generated carriers and the utilization rate of electrons, and thereby accelerated electron transfer to adsorbed molecules (e.g., CO 2 and H 2 O) 46,47.Fig. S4 shows UV-vis DRS for g-C 3 N 4 and BPg-C 3 N 4 .After loading BPQDs on g-C 3 N 4 , the absorption band edge of g-C 3 N 4 did not change significantly, implying that BPQDs did not improve the photon absorption efficiency.Based on the above discussion, BPQDs led to enhancing carrier separation and utilization efficiency of g-C 3 N 4 rather than improving the photon absorption efficiency. Our previous studies found that singlet oxygen ( 1 O 2 ) and superoxide radicals (O 2 -) were mainly generated from O 2 during the exciton and carrier photocatalytic process, respectively 47,48.The exciton effect plays an important role in photocatalytic process.Generally speaking, the more the singlet oxygen that is generated in a photocatalytic process, the stronger the electron-hole interactions occurring in the bulk of the photocatalysts.As a result, suppressing the excitonic effect and increasing exciton dissociation in the photocatalytic process are an effective strategy to increase the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction ability.Higher O 2 -formation rate of BPg-C 3 N 4 than g-C 3 N 4 (Fig. 5a,b) confirmed that BP improved the carrier photocatalytic process of g-C 3 N 4 and showed that g-C 3 N 4 displayed a better rate of 1 O 2 generation compared with BPg-C 3 N 4 (Fig. 5c,d), indicating that BPQDs accelerated exciton dissociation in g-C 3 N 4 .ESR was used to quantify 1 O 2 and O 2 -generation on g-C 3 N 4 and BPg-C 3 N 4 .The trapping agents 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine (TEMP) and 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) were used to detect the 1 O 2 and O 2 -, respectively, formed during the photocatalytic process 4748495051.As shown in Fig. 5e, 1 O 2 was generated during the photoexcitation of the samples, evidenced by a 1:1:1 triplet signal with typical g-value of 2.001 and hyperfine splitting constant a N 1.608 mT for 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-N-oxyl (TEMPO).Less 1 O 2 was formed after loading BPQDs on g-C 3 N 4 (Fig. 5f).Conversely, more O 2 -was detected after loading BPQDs on g-C 3 N 4 , evidenced by the sextet ESR signal of DMPO-OOH, a spin adduct derived from DMPO-O 2 -.The ESR spectra thus support the findings from the time dependent absorption spectra of TMB oxidation for g-C 3 N 4 and BPg-C 3 N 4 .The exciton photocatalytic process was suppressed and the carrier photocatalytic process was enhanced after loading BPQDs on g-C 3 N 4 .Accordingly, BPQDs/g-C 3 N 4 composites show improved carrier separation, electron utilization efficiency and CO 2 reduction performance compared to g-C 3 N 4 ."}], "reaction medium": [], "reactor type": [], "operation mode": []}}
