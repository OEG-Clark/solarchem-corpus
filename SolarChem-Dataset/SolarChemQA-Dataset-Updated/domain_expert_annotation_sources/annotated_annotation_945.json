To investigate the CO 2 adsorption capacity of the samples, pulse injection of CO 2 under UV light irradiation studies were performed using a TPD instrument (Fig. 2A andB).The pulse injection pattern showed that pristine P25 exhibited the highest signal amongst the samples, indicating the least amount of CO 2 injected into the sample.However, all calcined samples exhibited a much lower signal compared to pristine P25, indicating a much higher amount of CO 2 adsorbed by those calcined samples.The area under the curve was determined to estimate the volume of CO 2 adsorbed (Fig. 2C).The area under the curve reached a plateau aer 6 injections, indicating that the samples had been saturated with CO 2 aer being equilibrated with CO 2 for 24 h (purple region in Fig. 2C).Based on the integration of the graphs obtained, the area under the curve increased in the order of P25-NO P25-KO P25-NC P25-KC P25-C (Fig. 2C).However, the estimated volume of CO 2 adsorbed by the samples had an inverse relation to the area under the curve (Table 1).In other words, the capability of CO 2 adsorption decreased in the order of P25-NO P25-KO P25-NC P25-KC P25-C, which revealed similar trend as shown in the FTIR pattern in Fig. 1C.In other words, the amount of isolated -OH present in the samples directly inuenced the CO 2 adsorption capacity, as previously proposed. 26he photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 was performed under UV irradiation for 8 h (Fig. 3A).No carbonaceous product was observed when the samples were tested in the dark.The pristine P25 sample did not produce observable products, whereas, the calcined samples produced CO under UV irradiation.The CO production decreased in the order of P25-NO P25-KO P25-NC P25-KC P25-C.The higher CO production was observed for the P25 treated with hydroxides, namely P25-NO produced 12.3 mmol g A1 h A1 with a f CO 14 0.0167, followed by P25-KO (10.1 mmol g A1 h A1 ).Samples treated with carbonates presented lower conversion, e.g.7.4 and 5.9 mmol g A1 h A1 of CO by P25-NC and P25-KC, respectively.Transient photocurrent response is used to reveal the migration characteristics of photogenerated electrons. 27Overall, the samples treated with alkalis exhibited higher photocurrent than the pristine P25 and P25-C samples (Fig. 3B).Among the modied P25 samples, P25-NO revealed the highest photocurrent, indicating the resulted P25-NO solid solution had enhanced the transportation of the photogenerated electrons, that subsequently improved the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 into CO. 27The superior electronic property of P25-NO was probably due to higher relative amount of Ti 3 -OH/Ti 4 -OH formation than P25-KO.Hence, P25-NO revealed a much higher photocatalytic activity than P25-KO although they revealed very small difference in their CO 2 adsorption capacities (Table 1).In summary, the sample capable to adsorb the highest amount of CO 2 (Fig. 2) exhibited highest isolated -OH concentration, as shown in the FTIR pattern (Fig. 1C).In addition, the modication of P25 with alkalis generally enhanced the transport of photogenerated electrons, as shown in the photocurrent analysis (Fig. 3B).Among the modied samples, P25-NO revealed the highest photocurrent.The synergistic effects of the enhanced CO 2 adsorption and the transportation of photogenerated electrons had signicantly promoted the photoreduction of CO 2 into CO under UV irradiation."}, {"llm generation": "UV", "source": "The synergistic effects of the enhanced CO 2 adsorption and the transportation of photogenerated electrons had signicantly promoted the photoreduction of CO 2 into CO under UV irradiation.", "context": "Four types of alkalis, namely NaOH, Na 2 CO 3 , KOH and K 2 CO 3 , were used to modify the commercial P25, which has been extensively used as a benchmark photocatalyst. 21To distinguish the effect of high temperature calcination and salt modication, pristine P25 was treated at 900 C without the addition of salt.The modied P25, and resultant P25-C, P25-NO, P25-NC, P25-KO and P25-KC, revealed 100 rutile crystal phase, whereas pristine P25 had a mixture of anatase and rutile (Fig. 1A).This observation indicated that the phase transformation was primarily due to the calcination treatment. 22he surface area of the samples aer the calcination treatment with (46.4-48.3m 2 g A1 ) and without (48.5 m 2 g A1 ) the incorporation of alkali was reduced slightly compared to the pristine P25 (51.7 m 2 g A1 ).However, the calcination treatment reduced the zeta potential value signicantly from 35 mV (pristine P25) to A24.5 mV (P25-C).The addition of salts further decreased the zeta potential value to about A32 mV (Fig. 1B).This was due to the increase of the basicity of the materials upon the addition of alkalis.However, the type of salt added did not signicantly affect the zeta potential. Pristine P25 revealed a strong trough centred at 3391 cm A1 , which was assigned to the O-H stretching vibration bands, due to water adsorption (Fig. 1C). 23Upon calcination, this trough was weakened and this was also the case of the trough at 1630 cm A1 , which was assigned to the bending modes of adsorbed water, 24,25 indicating the dehydration of the sample. 11n addition to the decline of troughs, a very broad band emerged between 3600-3800 cm A1 due to the formation of Ti 3 -OH and/or Ti 4 -OH moieties (i.e., isolated hydroxyl groups) aer the addition of alkalis as proposed previously. 26he calcination treatment with or without the incorporation of alkalis with different anions (i.e., -OH A and -CO 3 2A ) and cations (i.e., Na and K ) changed the basicity, resulting from the formation of different amounts of isolated -OH groups in the modied P25.The amount of isolated -OH formed aer calcination within the samples decreased in the order of P25-NO P25-KO P25-NC P25-KC P25-C (Fig. 1C).Therefore, these observations proposed that hydroxides could induce more isolated -OH groups than carbonates during the alkali treatment.
