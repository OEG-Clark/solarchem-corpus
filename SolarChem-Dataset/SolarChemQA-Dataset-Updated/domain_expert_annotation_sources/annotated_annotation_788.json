The optical properties of the as-prepared samples were The photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction using the asprepared samples was investigated under visible-light illumination.The results of control experiments confirmed that no product for CO 2 reduction was detected in the absence of either irradiation or photocatalyst and the photocatalytic activity was never discovered using the pure WO 3 and Cu 2 O photocatalysts.WO 3 and Cu 2 O exhibited no or negligible activities for CO 2 reduction, which were mainly attributed to the weak electron reduction ability of WO 3 and rapid recombination of photo-generated electron-hole pairs in Cu 2 O, respectively.As shown in Fig. 5, the WO 3 / Cu 2 O composite samples all achieved the conversion from CO 2 to value-added products and variety kinds of products was found and included the H 2 , O 2 , CO and CH 4 molecules, which was the reason that water-splitting reaction competed with the CO 2 reduction.According to 13 C labelled isotropic experiment (Fig. S3), the CO and CH 4 products were generated from CO 2 gas reactant in this study.With the Cu 2 O content of composites increasing, the yields of CO and CH 4 products were gradually promoted and the H 2 yield decreased and the percentage of CH 4 yield in catalytic productions also increased (Table S1).The CO, CH 4 Apart from the composition of photocatalyst, the photocatalytic activity was usually influenced on the external conditions, such as the catalytic temperature, total pressure, molar ratio between CO 2 and H 2 O 2,3,30.The results about influence of reaction temperature on the photocatalytic activity were showed in Fig. S4.The photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction was not observably sensitive to the catalytic temperature from 5 C to 60 C. The temperature was hence set to 40 C in this experiment.Fig. 6 showed CO, CH 4 and O 2 yields of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with different molar ratio between CO 2 and H 2 O in the constant total pressure of 0.05 MPa for the optimized catalyst after 7 h irradiation.The CH 4 yield increases and the CO yield never exhibited the distinct change with CO 2 /H 2 O molar ratio increasing.But decrease beyond 0.025 ratio, all products yields showed the evident decrease, which may be explained by the fact that the H 2 O molecules are readily accessible to the catalyst surface with hydroxyl 28.However, too much H 2 O molecules may retard the redox reaction occurring at the surface of the catalyst.The influence of the photocatalytic activity on the catalytic pressure was investigated. Under optimized catalytic conduction, the photocatalytic activity of WO 3 /Cu 2 O-150 sample for CO 2 reduction was studied under visible-light illumination.As shown in Fig. 7, all product yields exhibited the escalation, prolonging the illumination time.Only small quantity of H 2 , as reduced production of water splitting, could be discovered after 12 h irradiation, which implied that the WO 3 / Cu 2 O sample has the property of the selected catalysis.The yields of CO, CH 4 , H 2 and O 2 products could attain 7.04, 8.42, 0.80 and 16.27 mmol after 24 h visible-light illumination.As shown in Fig. S5, the experimental yield of O 2 was lower than the theoretical value, and the difference between them increased with prolonging illumination time.It was possible that Cu(I) oxidation consumed the photoinduced holes and H 2 O 2 molecules were generated 28,31. In the practical applications of the long-term use, the reproducibility and durability of photocatalyst never be ignored.In the cycling tests (Fig. 8), the representative WO 3 /Cu 2 O-150 photocatalyst was recycled for the four times.In 4 cycling, the CO, CH 4 , H 2 and O 2 yields for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction still reached 4.76, 7.07, 0.40 and 11.84 mmol, respectively.It was revealed that the catalyst could maintain considerable activity.The XRD patterns and XPS spectra, which showed no apparent deterioration as compared to the fresh catalyst, supplied a powerful support for its stability (Figs.S6 andS7). Photocatalytic mechanism of the WO 3 /Cu 2 O samples for CO 2 reduction was studied, according to the experimental results.In this study, the Cu 2 O phase was deposited on the surface of WO 3 , and then the contact between the two phases would form a p-n junction.Under light illumination, the electrons of each semiconductor component in composites could be induced to CB and the holes were accordingly formed in VB.The photoinduced electron-hole separation process in heterojuntion can be schematically depicted in Fig. 9a andb.Since the products of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction never was discovered using the pure WO 3 and Cu 2 O sample, the reduction capacity of electrons in the CB of WO 3 would not realize the transform from CO 2 to CO and CH 4 .Based on the band energy alignment of heterojunction, the CB potential of WO 3 (0.06 V vs. NHE) was distinctly more positive than the standard redox potential E (CO2/CO) (A0.53 V vs. NHE) and E (CO2/ CH4) (A0.24 V vs. NHE) and hence, the electron in CB of WO 3 could not reduce CO 2 to CO or CH 4 in thermodynamics 1,2.The similar results was showed that the capacity of hole in the VB of Cu 2 O can not be able to oxidize water 2.According to the enhanced photocatalytic activity, the separation mode of photogenerated electron-hole maybe be followed by the Z-scheme mechanism (Fig. 9b).If so, the photoinduced electrons transfer directly from the CB of WO 3 to the VB of Cu 2 O and recombine with the holes.Hence, the abundant electrons was separated and accumulated in CB of Cu 2 O and the cumulative holes would stay at VB of WO 3 .Based on the band structure of WO 3 and Cu 2 O, the accumulated electron and hole would exhibit the strong reducing and oxidizing ability, which could accomplish CO 2 reduction and H 2 O oxidation, respectively.Hence, the WO 3 /Cu 2 O system may be a type of direct Z-scheme photocatalyst under our experimental conditions. In order to gain more demonstration for the separation of photoinduced electron-hole, transient photocurrent responses of pure and composite samples were recorded in on-off irradiation cycles.Fig. 10 presented the I-t curves for the WO 3 , pure Cu 2 O and WO 3 /Cu 2 O-150 samples.The photocurrent response of the WO 3 / Cu 2 O-150 composites can fast increase under each irradiation and quickly decrease in the dark, which was in accordance with an observation for Cu 2 O sample.Moreover, the photocurrent of the composite was least 2.5 times higher than that of pure sample, which indicated that the heterojuntion in composite brought the enhancement of electron-hole separation efficiency and the reduction of recombination rate 29,32. Based on the above analyses, it was clear that the WO 3 /Cu 2 O composites were typical direct Z-scheme photocatalysts for CO 2 reduction under visible-light irradiation.Nevertheless, the exact mechanism of CO 2 photoreduction was still not clear due to many questions to be unraveled, including the exact reaction pathway, the effects of the reaction conditions, as well as the selectivity of the entire process.Therefore, more experiments should be further made to understand the underlying mechanism of the activity and selectivity of the CO 2 photoreduction."}, {"llm generation": "WO 3 /Cu 2 O photocatalysts", "source": "A series of WO 3 /Cu 2 O photocatalysts were synthesized by a solvothermal-electrodeposition method.", "context": "A series of WO 3 /Cu 2 O photocatalysts were synthesized by a solvothermal-electrodeposition method.With the Cu 2 O content increasing, the WO 3 /Cu 2 O composite with 2D/3D morphology was formed and brought the enhanced photocatalytic performance for CO 2 reduction under visible light.The CO, CH 4 and H 2 yields for CO 2 reduction under water vapor could attain 7.04, 8.42 and 0.80 mmol after 24 h irradiation using the 2D/3D WO 3 /Cu 2 O photocatalyst.Besides, the effect of light intensity, water pressure and temperature on the photocatalytic activity was also investigated.The photocatalytic activity was not sensitive to the temperature in the experimental range.The mechanism of the improved photocatalytic activity was proposed and the photoreduction of CO 2 to CO and CH 4 in mixture atmosphere of CO 2 and water vapor was inferred.The enhanced photoactivity of WO 3 /Cu 2 O composites was ascribed to the efficient separation of the photoinduced electronhole pairs induced by Z-scheme transfer.In summary, the present research was expected to be useful in developing Z-scheme photocatalysts and provide some meaningful information for deep understanding how the photogenerated electrons transfer across the solid-solid contact interface. Structure, morphology and compositon XRD characterization was performed to investigate the crystal structure of single-component Cu 2 O and WO 3 samples and WO 3 / Cu 2 O composites with different deposition times.As shown in Fig. 1, the diffraction peaks at 36.4 and 42.3 were assigned to the (1 1 1) and (2 0 0) facets of cubic Cu 2 O (JCPDS No. 01-078-2076), and the peak intensities of Cu 2 O increased gradually with the extension of electro-deposition time.It indicated that the (1 1 1) facets of higher activity over cubic Cu 2 O was exhibited in the as-prepared WO 3 /Cu 2 O composite, leading to the enhanced performance for CO 2 reduction 11.Besides the peaks originated from Cu 2 O and FTO substrate, all the other diffraction peaks obtained from WO 3 /Cu 2 O were well indexed to hexagonal WO 3 (JCPDS No. 00-033-1387).The results indicated that Cu 2 O was successfully electrodeposited onto WO 3 platform, confirming the formation of WO 3 /Cu 2 O composites.

The optical properties of the as-prepared samples were The photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction using the asprepared samples was investigated under visible-light illumination.The results of control experiments confirmed that no product for CO 2 reduction was detected in the absence of either irradiation or photocatalyst and the photocatalytic activity was never discovered using the pure WO 3 and Cu 2 O photocatalysts.WO 3 and Cu 2 O exhibited no or negligible activities for CO 2 reduction, which were mainly attributed to the weak electron reduction ability of WO 3 and rapid recombination of photo-generated electron-hole pairs in Cu 2 O, respectively.As shown in Fig. 5, the WO 3 / Cu 2 O composite samples all achieved the conversion from CO 2 to value-added products and variety kinds of products was found and included the H 2 , O 2 , CO and CH 4 molecules, which was the reason that water-splitting reaction competed with the CO 2 reduction.According to 13 C labelled isotropic experiment (Fig. S3), the CO and CH 4 products were generated from CO 2 gas reactant in this study.With the Cu 2 O content of composites increasing, the yields of CO and CH 4 products were gradually promoted and the H 2 yield decreased and the percentage of CH 4 yield in catalytic productions also increased (Table S1).The CO, CH 4 Apart from the composition of photocatalyst, the photocatalytic activity was usually influenced on the external conditions, such as the catalytic temperature, total pressure, molar ratio between CO 2 and H 2 O 2,3,30.The results about influence of reaction temperature on the photocatalytic activity were showed in Fig. S4.The photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction was not observably sensitive to the catalytic temperature from 5 C to 60 C. The temperature was hence set to 40 C in this experiment.Fig. 6 showed CO, CH 4 and O 2 yields of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with different molar ratio between CO 2 and H 2 O in the constant total pressure of 0.05 MPa for the optimized catalyst after 7 h irradiation.The CH 4 yield increases and the CO yield never exhibited the distinct change with CO 2 /H 2 O molar ratio increasing.But decrease beyond 0.025 ratio, all products yields showed the evident decrease, which may be explained by the fact that the H 2 O molecules are readily accessible to the catalyst surface with hydroxyl 28.However, too much H 2 O molecules may retard the redox reaction occurring at the surface of the catalyst.The influence of the photocatalytic activity on the catalytic pressure was investigated. Under optimized catalytic conduction, the photocatalytic activity of WO 3 /Cu 2 O-150 sample for CO 2 reduction was studied under visible-light illumination.As shown in Fig. 7, all product yields exhibited the escalation, prolonging the illumination time.Only small quantity of H 2 , as reduced production of water splitting, could be discovered after 12 h irradiation, which implied that the WO 3 / Cu 2 O sample has the property of the selected catalysis.The yields of CO, CH 4 , H 2 and O 2 products could attain 7.04, 8.42, 0.80 and 16.27 mmol after 24 h visible-light illumination.As shown in Fig. S5, the experimental yield of O 2 was lower than the theoretical value, and the difference between them increased with prolonging illumination time.It was possible that Cu(I) oxidation consumed the photoinduced holes and H 2 O 2 molecules were generated 28,31. In the practical applications of the long-term use, the reproducibility and durability of photocatalyst never be ignored.In the cycling tests (Fig. 8), the representative WO 3 /Cu 2 O-150 photocatalyst was recycled for the four times.In 4 cycling, the CO, CH 4 , H 2 and O 2 yields for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction still reached 4.76, 7.07, 0.40 and 11.84 mmol, respectively.It was revealed that the catalyst could maintain considerable activity.The XRD patterns and XPS spectra, which showed no apparent deterioration as compared to the fresh catalyst, supplied a powerful support for its stability (Figs.S6 andS7). Photocatalytic mechanism of the WO 3 /Cu 2 O samples for CO 2 reduction was studied, according to the experimental results.In this study, the Cu 2 O phase was deposited on the surface of WO 3 , and then the contact between the two phases would form a p-n junction.Under light illumination, the electrons of each semiconductor component in composites could be induced to CB and the holes were accordingly formed in VB.The photoinduced electron-hole separation process in heterojuntion can be schematically depicted in Fig. 9a andb.Since the products of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction never was discovered using the pure WO 3 and Cu 2 O sample, the reduction capacity of electrons in the CB of WO 3 would not realize the transform from CO 2 to CO and CH 4 .Based on the band energy alignment of heterojunction, the CB potential of WO 3 (0.06 V vs. NHE) was distinctly more positive than the standard redox potential E (CO2/CO) (A0.53 V vs. NHE) and E (CO2/ CH4) (A0.24 V vs. NHE) and hence, the electron in CB of WO 3 could not reduce CO 2 to CO or CH 4 in thermodynamics 1,2.The similar results was showed that the capacity of hole in the VB of Cu 2 O can not be able to oxidize water 2.According to the enhanced photocatalytic activity, the separation mode of photogenerated electron-hole maybe be followed by the Z-scheme mechanism (Fig. 9b).If so, the photoinduced electrons transfer directly from the CB of WO 3 to the VB of Cu 2 O and recombine with the holes.Hence, the abundant electrons was separated and accumulated in CB of Cu 2 O and the cumulative holes would stay at VB of WO 3 .Based on the band structure of WO 3 and Cu 2 O, the accumulated electron and hole would exhibit the strong reducing and oxidizing ability, which could accomplish CO 2 reduction and H 2 O oxidation, respectively.Hence, the WO 3 /Cu 2 O system may be a type of direct Z-scheme photocatalyst under our experimental conditions. In order to gain more demonstration for the separation of photoinduced electron-hole, transient photocurrent responses of pure and composite samples were recorded in on-off irradiation cycles.Fig. 10 presented the I-t curves for the WO 3 , pure Cu 2 O and WO 3 /Cu 2 O-150 samples.The photocurrent response of the WO 3 / Cu 2 O-150 composites can fast increase under each irradiation and quickly decrease in the dark, which was in accordance with an observation for Cu 2 O sample.Moreover, the photocurrent of the composite was least 2.5 times higher than that of pure sample, which indicated that the heterojuntion in composite brought the enhancement of electron-hole separation efficiency and the reduction of recombination rate 29,32. Based on the above analyses, it was clear that the WO 3 /Cu 2 O composites were typical direct Z-scheme photocatalysts for CO 2 reduction under visible-light irradiation.Nevertheless, the exact mechanism of CO 2 photoreduction was still not clear due to many questions to be unraveled, including the exact reaction pathway, the effects of the reaction conditions, as well as the selectivity of the entire process.Therefore, more experiments should be further made to understand the underlying mechanism of the activity and selectivity of the CO 2 photoreduction."}, {"llm generation": "Gas", "source": "The mechanism of the improved photocatalytic activity was proposed and the photoreduction of CO 2 to CO and CH 4 in mixture atmosphere of CO 2 and water vapor was inferred.", "context": "A series of WO 3 /Cu 2 O photocatalysts were synthesized by a solvothermal-electrodeposition method.With the Cu 2 O content increasing, the WO 3 /Cu 2 O composite with 2D/3D morphology was formed and brought the enhanced photocatalytic performance for CO 2 reduction under visible light.The CO, CH 4 and H 2 yields for CO 2 reduction under water vapor could attain 7.04, 8.42 and 0.80 mmol after 24 h irradiation using the 2D/3D WO 3 /Cu 2 O photocatalyst.Besides, the effect of light intensity, water pressure and temperature on the photocatalytic activity was also investigated.The photocatalytic activity was not sensitive to the temperature in the experimental range.The mechanism of the improved photocatalytic activity was proposed and the photoreduction of CO 2 to CO and CH 4 in mixture atmosphere of CO 2 and water vapor was inferred.The enhanced photoactivity of WO 3 /Cu 2 O composites was ascribed to the efficient separation of the photoinduced electronhole pairs induced by Z-scheme transfer.In summary, the present research was expected to be useful in developing Z-scheme photocatalysts and provide some meaningful information for deep understanding how the photogenerated electrons transfer across the solid-solid contact interface.
