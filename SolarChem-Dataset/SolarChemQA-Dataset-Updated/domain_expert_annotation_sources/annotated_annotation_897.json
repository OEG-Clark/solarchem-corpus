XPS is used to characterize the surface element composition and chemical state of BMO, BMO-P, BMO-U and BMO-U-P. 31All the XPS survey spectra clearly demonstrated the existence of Bi, Mo, and O in all samples (Figure 2a).The C 1s peak is because of the widespread presence of carbon in the environment. 32Figure 2b-d show the high-resolution XPS of Bi 4f, Mo 3d, and O 1s, respectively.The Bi 4f spectrum exhibits two peaks located at 164.67 and 159.37 eV, resulting from the spin-orbit splitting of Bi 4f 5/2 and Bi 4f 7/2 , respectively (Figure 2b).Similarly, the Mo 3d spectrum also shows two peaks at 235.80 and 232.63 eV, which are attributed to the Mo 3d 3/2 and Mo 3d 5/2 , respectively (Figure 2c).The O 1s peak is divided into two peaks at 531.73 and 530.17 eV, corresponding to the surface adsorbed -OH and lattice oxygen atom, respectively (Figure 2d).In comparison with BMO and BMO-U, it can be clearly seen that the binding energies of Bi 4f, Mo 3d and O 1s peaks shift slightly to a lower position in BMO-P and BMO-U-P, which demonstrates that the corona poling changes the coordination environments of these atoms.It provides an obvious evidence for the presence of lattice distortion due to the strong external electric field, confirming the successful ferroelectric polarization. 18,33Moreover, the binding energies of the Bi 4f, UV-vis DRS were measured to compare the light absorption property of BMO, BMO-P, BMO-U and BMO-U-P. 34Figure 3a and 3b show the UV-vis DRS spectra of the samples and their bandgap energy level from the plots (hv) 1/2 estimated by the energy of absorbed light, respectively. 35From the steep absorption edge of the spectra, not the impurity level, there are relationships between the visible light absorption and the intrinsic band transition. 36,37Compared to BMO and BMO-P, the light absorption edges of BMO-U and BMO-U-P shift from 489 nm to 478 nm (a magnified view of the absorption edge is shown in the inset of Figure 3a), revealing that the thin-layered structure causes the blue shift of absorption edge, and the polarization treatment has no effect on the light absorption properties of the samples.The formula was used to determine the band gap (Eg) 38 : and the , v, h and E g correspond to coefficient, light frequency, Planck constant and band gap energy, respectively, and the A is a constant.The band gap of BMO-U and BMO-U-P was estimated to be 2.32 eV, which is slightly wider than that of BMO and BMO-P (2.30 eV) (Figure 3b). The band gap level plays a very important role in understanding the photocatalytic activity because the redox reaction types of a semiconductor are determined by the valence band (E VB ) and conduction band (E CB ) positions. 39In order to determine the flat band potential (E fb ) of BMO, BMO-P, BMO-U and BMO-U-P, the Mott-Schottky plots were measured under three different frequencies (500, 800 and 1000 Hz) as shown in Figure 3c, 3d, S3a and S3b. 40At the given different test frequencies, it is obvious that three tangents of the Mott-Schottky curves intersect at the same point on the X axis. And the E fb of BMO, BMO-P, BMO-U and BMO-U-P was determined to be -0.61,-0.61, -0.65 and -0.65 eV (versus to Ag/AgCl electrode), respectively.Thus versus to a standard hydrogen electrode (NHE), the E fb of BMO, BMO-P, BMO-U and BMO-U-P was -0.41, -0.41, -0.45 and -0.45 eV, respectively. 41It indicates that the polarization treatment does not change the position of the energy band.The series of BMO samples curves. 42In general, for n-type semiconductors, the E CB position is about 0.10.3eV more negative than E fb . 43Therefore, the E CB of BMO, BMO-P, BMO-U and BMO-U-P was approximately determined to be -0.51-0.51, -0.55 and -0.55 eV, respectively. The E EB can be calculated by the following formula 44 : the VB position of BMO, BMO-P, BMO-U and BMO-U-P is calculated to be 1.79, 1.79, 1.77 and 1.77 eV, respectively.As it is well known, there is a close relationship between the photoreduction ability and CB position for a semiconductor, and electrons on a more negative CB potential show a stronger driving force for reduction. 45,46Thus, BMO-U and BMO-U-P have a stronger CO 2 reductive ability.distilled water.Figure 4d shows the results of CO 2 reduction of BMO-U-P for three cycles.It can be seen that the CO production still maintains 44.36 mol g -1 after three cycles, revealing the good stability of BMO-U-P. Due to ferroelectric polarization, a strong polarization electric field will be formed between the two sides of BMO-U-P nanosheets, which can provide a stronger driving force for improving the separation and transfer efficiency of photogenerated charge carriers. 505115253 The surface potential of the samples was investigated by AFM and KPFM. Figure 5 shows the AFM topographic and KPFM potential images of the as-obtained samples, where the black and red lines represent for their thickness and surface potential, respectively.For more accurate comparison, the samples with the similar stacking thickness (31-33 nm) were selected for potential difference measurement, as shown by the height plots (the black lines) in Figure 5c, f, i andl.As revealed by the red lines, the potential difference of BMO, BMO-P, BMO-U and BMO-U-P is measured to be 28.25, 43.82, 56.02, and 108.25 mV, respectively.Thus, BMO-U-P has the largest surface potential difference, which indicates its strongest internal electric field, thus resulting in substantially strengthened separation and transfer efficiencies of photogenerated charge carriers. 54ge 17 of 30 Journal of Materials Chemistry A The polarization-electric field hysteresis curves of the as-obtained samples were measured to study the importance role of ferroelectricity in improving the photocatalytic performance (Figure 6a).When an electric field of -150150 kV/cm was applied, both the saturation polarization (Ps) and remnant polarization (Pr) display an order of BMO BMO-P BMO-U BMO-U-P.BMO-P and BMO-U-P show larger Ps and Pr than their non-polarized counterparts (BMO and BMO-U), which may be due to that corona poling causes the aligned arrangement of ferroelectric domains, thus enhancing the ferroelectricity, as confirmed by the surface potential difference of BMO-P and BMO-U-P (Figure 5).It was worth noting that the ferroelectricity of BMO-U is stronger than that of BMO-P, which may be attributed to that the fabrication of ultrathin structure increases the asymmetry of the structural units in Bi 2 MoO 6 .As shown in Table S1, the lattice parameter a of BMO-U has prolonged to be 5.49556 A from 5.48338 A for BMO, which clearly proves that lattice distortion has occurred in BMO-U.It can be explained as that the construction of thin-layer structure causes the absence of a large amount of surface atoms, which results in larger lattice distortion, contributing to enhanced spontaneous polarization of BMO-U.The same phenomenon was also observed for the ultra-thin SrTiO 3 material. 55It was also confirmed by the above XPS analysis that the largest shift in binding energy was observed for BMO-U-P.Based on the above analysis, it can be inferred that the microstructure change of ferroelectric materials also affects their ferroelectric properties.Due to the synergistic effect of thin-layered structure and corona poling, BMO-U-P shows the strongest ferroelectricity, consistent with KPFM observation. To investigate the relationship between ferroelectric properties and charge separation, PL was used to study the charge recombination rate in Bi 2 MoO 6 series samples. 56The recombination efficiency of photogenerated electrons and holes is demonstrated by the intensity of the PL emission peak, and a lower PL emission intensity means a lower recombination rate.Figure 6b displays that BMO shows the highest emission intensity reflects the interface layer resistance at the surface of electrode. 57Figure 6c shows the Nyquist plots of BMO, BMO-P, BMO-U and BMO-U-P under irradiation of simulated sunlight.It can be seen that the arc radius of BMO-P, BMO-U and BMO-U-P electrodes is all smaller than that of BMO, which indicates that the charge transfer rate can be increased by corona poling and fabrication of ultrathin structure.The smallest arc radius was observed for BMO-U-P, suggesting the fastest charge transfer efficiency. It is well known that difference in CO 2 adsorption capability has an impact on the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity.Figure 6d shows the CO 2 adsorption isotherms of BMO, BMO-P, BMO-U and BMO-U-P.Compared to BMO and BMO-P, the thinlayered structure in BMO-U and BMO-U-P greatly enhanced the CO 2 adsorption, which is due to exposure of more surface reactive sites.It has been reported that the photoreduction reaction mainly occurs on the 020 crystal plane of the Bi 2 MoO 6 . 58om Figure 1c, the exposed facet of the as-prepared BMO-U-P sample is 020 facet.Thus, the large exposure proportion of 020 facet in BMO-U-P is beneficial for increasing the surface catalytic sites for CO reduction.In addition, the polarized samples (BMO-P and BMO-U-P) also show slightly higher CO 2 adsorption ability than un-polarized counterparts.It may be because the corona poling results in the lattice distortion and asymmetric distribution of surface charges, benefiting the CO 2 adsorption. Based on the above analyses, the mechanisms for substantially boosted charge separation and CO 2 reduction reaction over BMO-U-P were proposed, as illustrated in Figure 7.Under the strong polarization electric field, the photogenerated electrons and holes are promptly separated and transferred to opposite directions along a or c axis. The thin-layered structure is also favorable for the fast migration of charge carriers from bulk phase to surface of BMO-U-P.Moreover, the surface reactive sites on the top facets were enriched, which greatly benefits CO 2 adsorption and activation.Especially, the ferroelectric polarization and thin-layered structure take a synergistic part in promoting the above advantages, thus co-boosting the CO 2 photoreduction activity of Bi 2 MoO 6 ."}, {"llm generation": "ultrathin Bi 2 MoO 6 nanosheets", "source": "In conclusion, ultrathin Bi 2 MoO 6 nanosheets with strengthened ferroelectricity were synthesized by a one-step hydrothermal reaction with the addition of CTAB followed Compared to bulk Bi 2 MoO 6 , the polarized ultrathin Bi 2 MoO 6 nanosheets demonstrated drastically enhanced CO 2 reduction activity for CO production with a rate of 14.38 mol g -1 h -1 in the gas-solid system, which is over 10 times higher than that of bulk Bi 2 MoO 6 .", "context": "In conclusion, ultrathin Bi 2 MoO 6 nanosheets with strengthened ferroelectricity were synthesized by a one-step hydrothermal reaction with the addition of CTAB followed Compared to bulk Bi 2 MoO 6 , the polarized ultrathin Bi 2 MoO 6 nanosheets demonstrated drastically enhanced CO 2 reduction activity for CO production with a rate of 14.38 mol g -1 h -1 in the gas-solid system, which is over 10 times higher than that of bulk Bi 2 MoO 6 .This study pioneers a cooperative strategy to regulate the charge separation and reactive sites on the basis of polarization and microstructure control.

The photocatalytic activity of BMO, BMO-P, BMO-U and BMO-U-P was investigated by CO 2 reduction under simulated solar irradiation in a gas-solid system. As demonstrated in Figure 4a, BMO shows the poorest CO 2 photoreduction performance among all the samples with a CO production of only 5.45 mol g -1 within 4 h.Both BMO-P and BMO-U samples exhibit improved photocatalytic performance, and the CO production reaches 22.06 and 16.34 mol g -1 , respectively.BMO-U-P displays the highest photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance with a CO production of 57.51 mol g -1 within 4 h. Figure 4b shows the corresponding CO production rate of these samples.The CO evolution rate of the BMO-U-P sample is 14.38 mol g -1 h -1 , which is over 10 times higher than that of BMO (1.36 mol g -1 h -1 ).This outstanding CO evolution rate is also higher than that of most of the previously reported bismuthbased catalysts, such as Bi 24 O 31 Cl 10 -OV (0.90 mol g -1 h -1 ), BiOI (5.18 mol g -1 h -1 ), and even some other state-of-the-art photocatalysts, such as Mg-In LDH (4.00 mol g - 1 h -1 ) (detailed comparison with more photocatalyts are shown in Table S2). 4748849 The control experiments of the BMO-U-P sample under different conditions were shown in"}], "co-catalyst": [], "light source": [{"llm generation": "Xe lamp", "source": "0.1 M Na 2 SO 4 aqueous solution was used as the electrolyte solution, and a 300 W Xe lamp was used as the light source.", "context": "All chemicals were of analytic grade and were used without further treatment.The ultrathin Bi 2 MoO 6 nanosheets were synthesized by a typical hydrothermal method. 1.940 g of Bi(NO 3 ) 3 5H 2 O was added in 30 ml of distilled water containing 10 molar ratio of CTAB.After sufficient ultrasonic stirring for 30 min, 0.484 g of Na 2 MoO 4 2H 2 O was added into the mixture solution followed by continuous ultrasonic stirring for 30 minutes, and then the mixture was transferred into a 50 ml Teflon-lined autoclave.The autoclave was heated in an oven at 180 C for 20 h.After cooling down to room temperature, the obtained products were collected by centrifugation and washed with hot distilled water and absolute ethanol for ten times.The resulting products were dried at 80 C for 12 h, and denoted as BMO-U.Bulk Bi 2 MoO 6 was synthesized according the same preparation procedure without the addition of CTAB, and the as-obtained products were named as BMO.

An atomic force microscopy (AFM) combined with Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) (Bruker Multimode 8) was used to provide the KPFM images.The samples were dispersed in absolute ethanol and then dropped on a silicon wafer to form a thin film."}, {"llm generation": "Solar", "source": "Figure 6c shows the Nyquist plots of BMO, BMO-P, BMO-U and BMO-U-P under irradiation of simulated sunlight.", "context": "The morphology, phase and crystal structure of the series of Bi 2 MoO 6 samples were studied.Figure 1a shows the XRD patterns.All the samples show diffraction peaks at do not change the crystalline phase of Bi 2 MoO 6 . 30The diffraction peak intensity ratio of the (131)/(200) crystal planes of BMO is about 3.57, which is higher than that of BMO-U (3.18).The decrease in this peak intensity ratio may indicate the presence of selective growth of specific facet of Bi 2 MoO 6 by the addition of CTAB.From the XRD data, it was found that the lattice parameters were altered in BMO-U, BMO-P and BMO-U-P, which indicates the distortion of crystal lattice and stronger polarization in these samples (Table S1).The unit cell parameters for a, b and c axis of BMO-U-P are changed by 0.161, 0.028 and -0.104 compared to that of BMO, respectively, which suggest that the crystal lattices undergo larger prolongation along a axis and compression along c axis.TEM image shows the nanosheet morphology of the as-prepared BMO-U-P (Figure 1b), revealing a lamellar structure.Figure 1c shows the HRTEM image of the BMO-U-P nanosheet, and the legible interplanar lattice with a space of 0.275 and 0.274 nm corresponds well with the (200) and (002) planes of Bi 2 MoO 6 , suggesting the exposure of 020 facet.The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (inset of Fig. 1c) further clearly reveals the single crystalline nature of the BMO-U-P nanosheet.The elemental mapping shows that Bi, Mo, O are evenly distributed in BMO-U-P (Figure 1d).The thickness of as-obtained series samples was measured by the AFM, and the results were shown in Figure 1e, 1f and S2.The thickness of BMO and BMO-P is approximately 40 nm, while that of BMO-U and BMO-U-P is about 3 nm.The thickness of BMO and BMO-U-P is consistent with their specific surface area (17.10 m 2 /g and 35.08 m 2 /g, respectively).The AFM results show that the ultrathin Bi 2 MoO 6 nanosheets were successfully obtained and the corona poling treatment has no obvious effect on the thickness of Bi 2 MoO 6 . XPS is used to characterize the surface element composition and chemical state of BMO, BMO-P, BMO-U and BMO-U-P. 31All the XPS survey spectra clearly demonstrated the existence of Bi, Mo, and O in all samples (Figure 2a).The C 1s peak is because of the widespread presence of carbon in the environment. 32Figure 2b-d show the high-resolution XPS of Bi 4f, Mo 3d, and O 1s, respectively.The Bi 4f spectrum exhibits two peaks located at 164.67 and 159.37 eV, resulting from the spin-orbit splitting of Bi 4f 5/2 and Bi 4f 7/2 , respectively (Figure 2b).Similarly, the Mo 3d spectrum also shows two peaks at 235.80 and 232.63 eV, which are attributed to the Mo 3d 3/2 and Mo 3d 5/2 , respectively (Figure 2c).The O 1s peak is divided into two peaks at 531.73 and 530.17 eV, corresponding to the surface adsorbed -OH and lattice oxygen atom, respectively (Figure 2d).In comparison with BMO and BMO-U, it can be clearly seen that the binding energies of Bi 4f, Mo 3d and O 1s peaks shift slightly to a lower position in BMO-P and BMO-U-P, which demonstrates that the corona poling changes the coordination environments of these atoms.It provides an obvious evidence for the presence of lattice distortion due to the strong external electric field, confirming the successful ferroelectric polarization. 18,33Moreover, the binding energies of the Bi 4f, UV-vis DRS were measured to compare the light absorption property of BMO, BMO-P, BMO-U and BMO-U-P. 34Figure 3a and 3b show the UV-vis DRS spectra of the samples and their bandgap energy level from the plots (hv) 1/2 estimated by the energy of absorbed light, respectively. 35From the steep absorption edge of the spectra, not the impurity level, there are relationships between the visible light absorption and the intrinsic band transition. 36,37Compared to BMO and BMO-P, the light absorption edges of BMO-U and BMO-U-P shift from 489 nm to 478 nm (a magnified view of the absorption edge is shown in the inset of Figure 3a), revealing that the thin-layered structure causes the blue shift of absorption edge, and the polarization treatment has no effect on the light absorption properties of the samples.The formula was used to determine the band gap (Eg) 38 : and the , v, h and E g correspond to coefficient, light frequency, Planck constant and band gap energy, respectively, and the A is a constant.The band gap of BMO-U and BMO-U-P was estimated to be 2.32 eV, which is slightly wider than that of BMO and BMO-P (2.30 eV) (Figure 3b). The band gap level plays a very important role in understanding the photocatalytic activity because the redox reaction types of a semiconductor are determined by the valence band (E VB ) and conduction band (E CB ) positions. 39In order to determine the flat band potential (E fb ) of BMO, BMO-P, BMO-U and BMO-U-P, the Mott-Schottky plots were measured under three different frequencies (500, 800 and 1000 Hz) as shown in Figure 3c, 3d, S3a and S3b. 40At the given different test frequencies, it is obvious that three tangents of the Mott-Schottky curves intersect at the same point on the X axis. And the E fb of BMO, BMO-P, BMO-U and BMO-U-P was determined to be -0.61,-0.61, -0.65 and -0.65 eV (versus to Ag/AgCl electrode), respectively.Thus versus to a standard hydrogen electrode (NHE), the E fb of BMO, BMO-P, BMO-U and BMO-U-P was -0.41, -0.41, -0.45 and -0.45 eV, respectively. 41It indicates that the polarization treatment does not change the position of the energy band.The series of BMO samples curves. 42In general, for n-type semiconductors, the E CB position is about 0.10.3eV more negative than E fb . 43Therefore, the E CB of BMO, BMO-P, BMO-U and BMO-U-P was approximately determined to be -0.51-0.51, -0.55 and -0.55 eV, respectively. The E EB can be calculated by the following formula 44 : the VB position of BMO, BMO-P, BMO-U and BMO-U-P is calculated to be 1.79, 1.79, 1.77 and 1.77 eV, respectively.As it is well known, there is a close relationship between the photoreduction ability and CB position for a semiconductor, and electrons on a more negative CB potential show a stronger driving force for reduction. 45,46Thus, BMO-U and BMO-U-P have a stronger CO 2 reductive ability.distilled water.Figure 4d shows the results of CO 2 reduction of BMO-U-P for three cycles.It can be seen that the CO production still maintains 44.36 mol g -1 after three cycles, revealing the good stability of BMO-U-P. Due to ferroelectric polarization, a strong polarization electric field will be formed between the two sides of BMO-U-P nanosheets, which can provide a stronger driving force for improving the separation and transfer efficiency of photogenerated charge carriers. 505115253 The surface potential of the samples was investigated by AFM and KPFM. Figure 5 shows the AFM topographic and KPFM potential images of the as-obtained samples, where the black and red lines represent for their thickness and surface potential, respectively.For more accurate comparison, the samples with the similar stacking thickness (31-33 nm) were selected for potential difference measurement, as shown by the height plots (the black lines) in Figure 5c, f, i andl.As revealed by the red lines, the potential difference of BMO, BMO-P, BMO-U and BMO-U-P is measured to be 28.25, 43.82, 56.02, and 108.25 mV, respectively.Thus, BMO-U-P has the largest surface potential difference, which indicates its strongest internal electric field, thus resulting in substantially strengthened separation and transfer efficiencies of photogenerated charge carriers. 54ge 17 of 30 Journal of Materials Chemistry A The polarization-electric field hysteresis curves of the as-obtained samples were measured to study the importance role of ferroelectricity in improving the photocatalytic performance (Figure 6a).When an electric field of -150150 kV/cm was applied, both the saturation polarization (Ps) and remnant polarization (Pr) display an order of BMO BMO-P BMO-U BMO-U-P.BMO-P and BMO-U-P show larger Ps and Pr than their non-polarized counterparts (BMO and BMO-U), which may be due to that corona poling causes the aligned arrangement of ferroelectric domains, thus enhancing the ferroelectricity, as confirmed by the surface potential difference of BMO-P and BMO-U-P (Figure 5).It was worth noting that the ferroelectricity of BMO-U is stronger than that of BMO-P, which may be attributed to that the fabrication of ultrathin structure increases the asymmetry of the structural units in Bi 2 MoO 6 .As shown in Table S1, the lattice parameter a of BMO-U has prolonged to be 5.49556 A from 5.48338 A for BMO, which clearly proves that lattice distortion has occurred in BMO-U.It can be explained as that the construction of thin-layer structure causes the absence of a large amount of surface atoms, which results in larger lattice distortion, contributing to enhanced spontaneous polarization of BMO-U.The same phenomenon was also observed for the ultra-thin SrTiO 3 material. 55It was also confirmed by the above XPS analysis that the largest shift in binding energy was observed for BMO-U-P.Based on the above analysis, it can be inferred that the microstructure change of ferroelectric materials also affects their ferroelectric properties.Due to the synergistic effect of thin-layered structure and corona poling, BMO-U-P shows the strongest ferroelectricity, consistent with KPFM observation. To investigate the relationship between ferroelectric properties and charge separation, PL was used to study the charge recombination rate in Bi 2 MoO 6 series samples. 56The recombination efficiency of photogenerated electrons and holes is demonstrated by the intensity of the PL emission peak, and a lower PL emission intensity means a lower recombination rate.Figure 6b displays that BMO shows the highest emission intensity reflects the interface layer resistance at the surface of electrode. 57Figure 6c shows the Nyquist plots of BMO, BMO-P, BMO-U and BMO-U-P under irradiation of simulated sunlight.It can be seen that the arc radius of BMO-P, BMO-U and BMO-U-P electrodes is all smaller than that of BMO, which indicates that the charge transfer rate can be increased by corona poling and fabrication of ultrathin structure.The smallest arc radius was observed for BMO-U-P, suggesting the fastest charge transfer efficiency. It is well known that difference in CO 2 adsorption capability has an impact on the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity.Figure 6d shows the CO 2 adsorption isotherms of BMO, BMO-P, BMO-U and BMO-U-P.Compared to BMO and BMO-P, the thinlayered structure in BMO-U and BMO-U-P greatly enhanced the CO 2 adsorption, which is due to exposure of more surface reactive sites.It has been reported that the photoreduction reaction mainly occurs on the 020 crystal plane of the Bi 2 MoO 6 . 58om Figure 1c, the exposed facet of the as-prepared BMO-U-P sample is 020 facet.Thus, the large exposure proportion of 020 facet in BMO-U-P is beneficial for increasing the surface catalytic sites for CO reduction.In addition, the polarized samples (BMO-P and BMO-U-P) also show slightly higher CO 2 adsorption ability than un-polarized counterparts.It may be because the corona poling results in the lattice distortion and asymmetric distribution of surface charges, benefiting the CO 2 adsorption. Based on the above analyses, the mechanisms for substantially boosted charge separation and CO 2 reduction reaction over BMO-U-P were proposed, as illustrated in Figure 7.Under the strong polarization electric field, the photogenerated electrons and holes are promptly separated and transferred to opposite directions along a or c axis. The thin-layered structure is also favorable for the fast migration of charge carriers from bulk phase to surface of BMO-U-P.Moreover, the surface reactive sites on the top facets were enriched, which greatly benefits CO 2 adsorption and activation.Especially, the ferroelectric polarization and thin-layered structure take a synergistic part in promoting the above advantages, thus co-boosting the CO 2 photoreduction activity of Bi 2 MoO 6 ."}], "lamp": [{"llm generation": "Xenon", "source": "0.1 M Na 2 SO 4 aqueous solution was used as the electrolyte solution, and a 300 W Xe lamp was used as the light source.", "context": "All chemicals were of analytic grade and were used without further treatment.The ultrathin Bi 2 MoO 6 nanosheets were synthesized by a typical hydrothermal method. 1.940 g of Bi(NO 3 ) 3 5H 2 O was added in 30 ml of distilled water containing 10 molar ratio of CTAB.After sufficient ultrasonic stirring for 30 min, 0.484 g of Na 2 MoO 4 2H 2 O was added into the mixture solution followed by continuous ultrasonic stirring for 30 minutes, and then the mixture was transferred into a 50 ml Teflon-lined autoclave.The autoclave was heated in an oven at 180 C for 20 h.After cooling down to room temperature, the obtained products were collected by centrifugation and washed with hot distilled water and absolute ethanol for ten times.The resulting products were dried at 80 C for 12 h, and denoted as BMO-U.Bulk Bi 2 MoO 6 was synthesized according the same preparation procedure without the addition of CTAB, and the as-obtained products were named as BMO.
