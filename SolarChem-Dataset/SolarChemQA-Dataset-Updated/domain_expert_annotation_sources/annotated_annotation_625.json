The grid-like TiO 2 films were prepared by a facile hydrothermal method 24.Firstly, commercial Ti foils (20 mm 20 mm 0.25 mm) were cleaned with a mixed solution consisting of deionized water, hydrofluoric acid and nitric acid.The cleaned Ti foils were then immersed in hydrogen peroxide solution and treated at 393K in a furnace for 2 h.
