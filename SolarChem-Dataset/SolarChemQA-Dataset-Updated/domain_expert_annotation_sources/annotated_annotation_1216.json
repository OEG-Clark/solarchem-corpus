ultrathin nanosheets (CNSX) with a thickness of 4 TiO 2 cells are successfully created 37.", "context": "The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was adopted to determine the crystal phases of the prepared samples.As shown in Fig. 1a, the diffraction patterns of all samples show the characteristic diffraction peaks of anatase TiO 2 (JCPDS No: 65-5714) 31.The diffraction patterns of CNSX display three diffraction peaks at 36.4 , 42.3 and 61.4 can be well assigned to the (111), ( 200) and (220) crystal facets of cubic Cu 2 O (JCPDS No: 05-0667), suggesting that the samples consist of the Cu 2 O/TiO 2 (anatase) 32.In addition, a small shift to high angle of the lattice plane (101) is observed in the diffraction patterns of CNSX (Fig. 1b) compared to NS, inferring that the strong interaction between Cu 2 O and TiO 2 33.The prepared catalysts with an ultra-thin structure (3.2 nm) could be demonstrated by SEM, TEM and AFM images in Fig. 1c, d ande.The DRS spectra (Figure .S2a) depict that the Cu 2 O sample spectrum has an obvious blue shift compared with spectrum of standard Cu 2 O due to quantum scale effect, suggesting that the diameter of Cu 2 O is up to nanoscale.Furthermore, a high dispersed nano-clusters with 2 nm diameter can be obviously found in the TEM and HADDF images (Fig. 1e andf).The HRTEM image (Fig. 2a) exhibits two kinds of the lattice stripes with 0.35 and 0.24 nm, corresponding to the lattice planes (101) of anatase TiO 2 and (111) of Cu 2 O, respectively 343536.The distinct selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Fig. 2b) shows the polycrystalline anatase phase of the sample.In addition, mapping images (Fig. 2c) further reveal that the Cu element is uniformly distributed on the TiO 2 nanosheets.So, it means that the Cu 2 O clusters/TiO 2 ultrathin nanosheets (CNSX) with a thickness of 4 TiO 2 cells are successfully created 37. N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherm (Figure .S2b) reveals that the specific surface area of all the samples is about 90 m 2 /g, which may offer abundant active sites on the surface to adsorb more CO 2 molecule for improving the photocatalytic activity 38.The separation and transfer ability for photogenerated electrons-holes of the prepared samples was valued by the transient photocurrent response, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and PL (Figure . S3 a, b andc).The photo-response current of the catalysts (NS: 11.5, CNS1: 22.3, CNS2: 40.2 and CNS3: 49.3 Acm -2 ) gradually increase with adding the loading-mass of Cu 2 O, revealing that Cu 2 O could accelerate the separation and transfer ability for carries 39.The EIS and PL analysis also can give an assistance for this result 40.It may be attributed to the generated direct Z-scheme heterostructure in Fig. S12 41. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to detect the chemical composition and the chemical state of each element for unveiling whether the preconceived active sites are exposed on the prepared samples.The XPS survey (Figure .S4a) shows that Ti, O and Cu elements can be detected in CNSX, suggesting that Cu 2 O is loaded on TiO 2 nanosheets successfully.The high-resolution Ti 2p spectra are displayed in Fig. 3a.The peaks of NS spectrum at 463.6 eV, 457.1 eV and 462.6 eV, 456.9 eV are corresponded to Ti 4 2p 1/2 , Ti 4 2p 3/2 and Ti 3 2p 1/2 , Ti 3 2p 3/2 , respectively 42.However, in the spectra of CNSX, the intensity of Ti 3 characteristic peaks gradually weakens and until disappears.Particularly, the Ti 2p spectra of CNSX can be fitted by added a group of peaks with higher binding energy (CNS1: 465.4 eV, 459.8 eV, CNS2: 465.7 eV, 459.9 eV and CNS3: 465.5 eV, 456.0 eV), which may be assigned to Ti 4 2p 1/2 and Ti 4 2p 3/2 43.It means that Ti 4 sites may act as the electron-deficient Ti sites (LA).Moreover, the electron binding energy of Ti in CNSX increases compared with that of in NS, demonstrating that Ti would loss electrons.The high-resolution Cu2p (Fig. 3b) and CuLMM spectra (Figure .S4b) of the samples depict the chemical state of Cu.A group of main peaks at 932.6 and 952.4 eV are observed in the spectra of Cu 2 O, belonging to Cu /Cu 0 2p 1/2 and 2p 3/2 .A peak at 916.6 eV is showed in CuLMM spectra, identifying that the Cu chemical state is Cu 44.Moreover, a small group of peaks at 934.5 and 954.3 eV could be assigned to Cu 2 2p 1/2 and Cu 2 2p 3/2 , respectively 45.The XPS spectra of CNSX exhibit a single group of peaks at 932.0, 951.4 eV (CNS1), 931.5, 952.8 eV (CNS2) and 931.4,951.0 eV (CNS3).According to the CuLMM spectra, the chemical state of Cu in the CNSX is considered as Cu .Compared with the binding energy of Cu in NS, a large shift toward the low-binding-energy side is observed in CNSX, suggesting that the electrons density of Cu increases greatly.Therefore, the electron-rich Cu 1- as a LB site may be appeared on CNSX.These XPS results reveal that the Cu -Ti 3 interface interaction may be generated via the charge transfer from Ti to Cu, which further causes the formation of electron-deficient Ti 4 sites (LA) and electron-rich Cu 1- (LB) sites on CNSX.The O chemical state of the samples is revealed by the high-resolution O1s XPS spectra (Figure . S4c, andd).The spectra could be deconvoluted into three peaks, which is identified as lattice oxygen (O1), hydroxyl (O2) and adsorbed oxygen (O3), respectively 46.EPR was used to further reveal the active sites (Fig. 3c).NS possess some Ti 3 , which could be inferred from the peaks at g value of 2.003 and 1.997 47.The peak at g value of 2.212 belongs to the Cu 2 defects with unpaired electrons in 3d orbitals.In additional, the peak at g value of 2.002 could be considered as the metallic Cu clusters because Cu obtains electrons from Ti 3 42.The peak at g value of 1.973 may be assigned to the unpaired electrons of other species formed by the charge transfer 48.This result may provide additional evidence for the Cu -Ti 3 interface interaction. Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) was carried out under H 2 atmosphere to further clear the type of metal oxide species and the interaction of Cu 2 O with TiO 2 .The H 2 -TPR profiles of the catalysts are presented in Fig. 3d.The reduction profile of NS shows a main peak at 510 C which might be attributed to the reduction of unsaturated Ti (such as Ti 3 ) 49.The peaks intensity at 510 C of CNSX reduction profile gradually weaken, which may be considered as the decrease of Ti 3 content.Moreover, three main peaks at 350(CNS1), 325(CNS2) and 309 C (CNS3) are observed in the profile, assigning to the reduction of Cu 50.The lowered reduction temperature reveals that the reduction Cu becomes easier, inferring that the Cu site obtain electrons from the Ti 3 site 51.These results further confirm that the electron-deficient Ti 4 sites (LA) and electron-rich Cu 1- (LB) sites is created successfully on CNSX. To verify whether the photocatalyst could exhibit the desired results, the performances of catalysts about photoreduction CO 2 were carried out in atmospheric pressure under Xe light irradiation without any sacrificial reagents under ( 360 nm) light irradiation.As shown in Fig. 7a, NS exhibits a high CH 4 yield (37.6 mol g -1 h -1 ) with a near 100 selectivity.However, when Cu 2 O is loaded, CO as a product is appeared.Two products of CH 4 (46.3 mol g -1 h -1 , 72) and CO (19.8 mol g -1 h -1 , 28) are generated on CNS1.The increase of CH 4 activity may be assigned to the improved the separation and transfer of the photogenerated carries by Cu 2 O loaded on CNS1.With the increase of Cu 2 O mass, the selectivity and activity of CO are gradually raised, whereas the yield of CH 4 gradually decreases.CNS3 shows the highest yield of CO (162.6 mol g -1 h -1 , 98).It is obvious that introducing Cu 2 O could improve the yield of CO, which may be attributed to the variation of CO 2 coordination mode.To further explore the optimal mass of loaded Cu 2 O, the catalysts with more Cu 2 O were prepared for photoreduction CO 2 .7 wt Cu 2 O/TiO 2 (CNS4) still exhibits a high selectivity of CO (96.5).However, H 2 as a product is appeared with a selectivity of 3.5.The yield of H 2 is kept for boosting when Cu 2 O mass is further increased.The selectivity of H 2 is up to 97.2 on 12 wt Cu 2 O/TiO 2 (CNS6).Therefore, 5 wt and 7 wt Cu 2 O may be the best loaded mass for optimal yield of CO. Moreover, in the Table S1, all the catalysts exhibit negligible photocatalytic activity in the absence of either H 2 O or light irradiation, indicating that the products (CH 4 and CO) are originated from CO 2 reduction.CO 2 was replaced by isotope 13 CO 2 to further confirm that the CH 4 and CO are produced by CO 2 photoreduction.In GC-MS results (Fig. 7b), the peak at the retention time of 0.7 and 1.7 min are belonged to 13 CO (m/z 29) and 13 CH 4 (m/z 17) respectively, indicating the generated products from CO 2 reduction. As an example, the stability of CNS3 was investigated via a 36-hours tests (Fig. S5).CNS3 can keep better yield of CO.To further explore the photostability of CNS3, the used photocatalyst is characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM (Fig. S6), and XPS (Fig. S7).These analyses show that the morphology structure and chemical property of the catalyst have negligible change.So, the catalysts keep the better photocatalytic stability. To unveil why the products selectivity of CH 4 and CO can be tailored, the coordination behavior of CO 2 on the catalysts has been explored through a serious of in situ characterization analysis.DRS was used to determine the catalyst optical property.The loaded Cu 2 O increase a little visible light sorption of the catalysts (Fig. S8).Furthermore, a special experimental phenomenon is observed when the CO 2 was injected into the reaction bottle with catalyst (CNSX) suspension.As shown in Fig. 4 inset, the color of CNSX would become yellow due to injected CO 2 but the catalysts keep white under Ar, showing that the adsorbed CO 2 would make the catalysts yellowing.Fig. 4a, b, c andd shows that CNSX could expand the absorption of visible light after absorption CO 2 because a charge transfer band between CO 2 and catalyst may be generated to absorb visible light 52,53.It means that abundant CO 2 molecules would be coordinated on the catalysts via the charge transfer, which would enhance the activity of CO 2 photoreduction. XPS was adopted to uncover the interaction between CO 2 and the active sites (Cu and Ti) via detecting the chemical state of each element in the catalysts after adsorption of CO 2 .As shown in Fig. S9, the high resolution C1s spectra of the catalysts reveal that only adventitious carbon peaks at 284.8 eV.After adsorption CO 2 , two peaks with higher binding energy (286.4 and 288.4 eV) can be added into the C1s spectra (Fig. 5a), which may be assigned to C-O and C--O of the adsorbed CO 2 , respectively.It is obvious that C-O components increase in CNSX, suggesting that the coordination mode of CO 2 may possess C-O bonds.Moreover, in Fig. 5b, the O1s spectra show that intensity of the peaks at about 532.0 obviously increase, corresponding to the C--O or C-O of the adsorbed CO 2 .The high resolution Ti2p spectra (Fig. 5c) show that the signals of Ti 4 disappear in CNSX after adsorption CO 2 .Meanwhile, the binding energy of Ti shifts toward to the lower binding energy, suggesting that the electron density of Ti increase.It could be concluded that Ti sites may obtain additional electrons from CO 2 .Fig. 5d shows that the Cu binding energy in CNSX is higher than that of the catalysts after adsorption CO 2 , inferring that the electron density of Cu decreases.It indicates that the electrons of Cu sites may be transferred into CO 2 .To further investigate binding and electron transfer between active sites and CO 2 molecules, in situ EPR measurement is carried out.The CO 2 adsorption on NS were explored in our previous work.So, the EPR spectra of CNSX before and after the adsorption of CO 2 are displayed in Fig. 6a.The g and A tensors (A for Cu of 137 G and g of 2.342) appear in spectra after adsorption CO 2 , demonstrating that CO 2 would be bind on the catalyst via the formation of Cu complex 54.The peak at 1.973 disappear, revealing that the unpaired electrons were redistributed on the catalysts surface due to the adsorbed CO 2 55.The Cu clusters signals at 2.002 also become weak after adsorption CO 2 , which may be attributed to the electrons transfer from Cu to CO 2 .Therefore, it determines that CO 2 molecule would be coordinated on the catalysts via the electrons transfer from Cu 1- to CO 2 and CO 2 to Ti 4 .Therefore, the bimetal bridging CuCO 2 Ti intermediate ( 1 - 2 ) may be formed on CNSX.In situ FT-IR was adopted out to further explore the coordination mode for CO 2 .As shown in Fig. 6b, the peaks at 1227 cm -1 could be assigned to the asymmetrical stretching vibration of C--O bond in bridging TiCO 2 -Ti species 15.With increasing the mass of loaded temperature reveals that the coordination species have changed.Based on above results, it could be concluded that the coordination mode on CNSX possesses C--O and C-O bonds.Moreover, the electrons transfer takes place between in CO 2 and active sites (OTi 4 and Cu 1- C).Hence, the bimetal bridging CuCO 2 Ti mode is generated assuredly on CNSX.Moreover, the bridging TiCO 2 -Ti mode would disappear on the catalysts but the bimetal bridging CuCO 2 Ti appear gradually with increasing the mass of Cu 2 O. Therefore, the products selectivity of CO and CH 4 could be governed effectively. Based on above results and discussion, a possible mechanism is discussed to elucidate CO and CH 4 generation pathway on the catalysts and further understand how the coordination mode determines the products selectivity.As shown in Fig. 8, under dark, CO 2 molecule would be bonded on the surface of catalyst.On NS surface, CO 2 can be absorbed via the formation of TiCO 2 -Ti intermediate which facilitates CH 4 generation.However, on CNSX surface, Cu -Ti 3 interface interaction results in the formation of electron-deficient Ti 4 sites (LA) and electron-rich Cu 1- (LB) sites.So, the bimetal bridging CuCO 2 Ti species is formed via the charge transfer from O (CO 2 ) to Ti 4 and Cu 1- to C. Because of this bidirectional charge transfer, the activated CO 2 molecule may keep electric neutrality, which impedes the protonation of CO 2 and further makes the product toward to the production of CO.In addition, in this intermediate, only one C--O coordinates with the active sites, implying that the activated C--O is easier to be dissociated for generating CO.Under light, the catalysts and the charge transfer band would be excited to fleetly produce the photogenerated electrons.Then the electrons are quickly transferred to the coordinated CO 2 via the coordination bond.Finally, the generated CO and CH 4 split away off the catalyst.Meanwhile, the photogenerated holes may be consumed to produce H 2 O 2 and O 2 , which is discussed in our previous work 14."}, {"llm generation": "Cu 2 O clusters/TiO 2 ultrathin nanosheet", "source": "In summary, the products selectivity of CH 4 and CO from photoreduction CO 2 is successfully controlled via creating Cu 2 O clusters/TiO 2 ultrathin nanosheet as a photocatalyst, which is profited from the Cu -Ti 3 interface interaction to tailor the coordination mode of CO 2 .", "context": "In summary, the products selectivity of CH 4 and CO from photoreduction CO 2 is successfully controlled via creating Cu 2 O clusters/TiO 2 ultrathin nanosheet as a photocatalyst, which is profited from the Cu -Ti 3 interface interaction to tailor the coordination mode of CO 2 .The Cu -Ti 3 interface interaction causes the generation of Cu 1- and Ti 4 sites and elimination of Ti 3 via the charge transfer from Ti 3 to Cu .In this case, the bimetal bridging CuCO 2 Ti species with coordination bonds (OTi and CuC) would be formed on CNSX, which determines the formation CO.Moreover, loading Cu 2 O can improve the adsorption of visible light and the separation and transfer ability for generated carriers.The CO 2 coordination greatly increases the adsorption of visible light, which benefits from the excitation of the charge transfer band.The coordination bonds could accelerate the photogenerated electron transfer to CO 2 for generating the products.As a result, NS exhibits 100 selectivity of CH 4 (37.6 mol g -1 h -1 ) but CNS3 achieves 98 selectivity of CO (162.6 mol g -1 h -1 ).This work may provide a special horizon to tailor the products selectivity from photoreduction CO 2 via the interface interaction mediated the CO 2 coordination mode.

DRS of the samples before and after adsorption of CO 2 . , a new peak at 2080 cm -1 gradually appears in the spectra of CNSX but the peak at 1227 cm -1 disappears.It is reported that the peak (2080 cm -1 ) may be considered as the symmetrical stretching vibration (C--O) of the CO group56.Compared the vibration peak of C--O bond at 2365 cm -1 in free CO 2 , this peak (2080 cm -1 ) shifts to lower wavenumbers, implying that one C--O of CO 2 may be not involved in coordination.So, the bimetal bridging CuCO 2 Ti intermediate may be desorption of CO 2 (CO 2 -TPD) was used to further distinguish the bridging TiCO 2 -Ti and bimetal bridging CuCO 2 Ti intermediate.Each sample only exhibits a main desorption peak at 214 (NS), 208 (CNS1), 198 (CNS2) and 178 C (CNS3) in Fig. 6c, assigning to the adsorption CO 2 species.The hapticity of bridging TiCO 2 -Ti intermediate ( 2 - 4 ) is higher than that of the bimetal bridging CuCO 2 Ti ( 1 - 2 ), suggesting that TiCO 2 -Ti is more stable than CuCO 2 Ti 57.Therefore, the decreased desorption Fig. 5.

The CO 2 photoreduction experiments were performed in a 45 mL glass bottle at ambient temperature (Fig. S1). 10 mg of catalyst was dispersed in 20 mL of pure water by sonication to get pulp suspension.This system was treated with vacuum degassing and then refilled with pure CO 2 gas (99.999) for 5 times.The photocatalytic reaction was carried out for 6 h with UV-vis-light irradiation (PLS-SXE300D, 1000 mW/cm 2 , Beijing Perfectlight Co., Ltd. 360 nm).After photoreaction, 0.4 mL of mixed gas was taken from the reactor to analyze the gas concentration of the product using a gas chromatography (GC-7890B, Agilent) equipped with a TCD, an FID detector and a chromatographic column (MolSieve 5 A).The isotopic 13 CO 2 experiment was analyzed by an Agilent GC-MS analyzer with 5977B MSD mass spectrometer. The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was adopted to determine the crystal phases of the prepared samples.As shown in Fig. 1a, the diffraction patterns of all samples show the characteristic diffraction peaks of anatase TiO 2 (JCPDS No: 65-5714) 31.The diffraction patterns of CNSX display three diffraction peaks at 36.4 , 42.3 and 61.4 can be well assigned to the (111), ( 200) and (220) crystal facets of cubic Cu 2 O (JCPDS No: 05-0667), suggesting that the samples consist of the Cu 2 O/TiO 2 (anatase) 32.In addition, a small shift to high angle of the lattice plane (101) is observed in the diffraction patterns of CNSX (Fig. 1b) compared to NS, inferring that the strong interaction between Cu 2 O and TiO 2 33.The prepared catalysts with an ultra-thin structure (3.2 nm) could be demonstrated by SEM, TEM and AFM images in Fig. 1c, d ande.The DRS spectra (Figure .S2a) depict that the Cu 2 O sample spectrum has an obvious blue shift compared with spectrum of standard Cu 2 O due to quantum scale effect, suggesting that the diameter of Cu 2 O is up to nanoscale.Furthermore, a high dispersed nano-clusters with 2 nm diameter can be obviously found in the TEM and HADDF images (Fig. 1e andf).The HRTEM image (Fig. 2a) exhibits two kinds of the lattice stripes with 0.35 and 0.24 nm, corresponding to the lattice planes (101) of anatase TiO 2 and (111) of Cu 2 O, respectively 343536.The distinct selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Fig. 2b) shows the polycrystalline anatase phase of the sample.In addition, mapping images (Fig. 2c) further reveal that the Cu element is uniformly distributed on the TiO 2 nanosheets.So, it means that the Cu 2 O clusters/TiO 2 ultrathin nanosheets (CNSX) with a thickness of 4 TiO 2 cells are successfully created 37.

The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to detect the chemical composition and the chemical state of each element for unveiling whether the preconceived active sites are exposed on the prepared samples.The XPS survey (Figure .S4a) shows that Ti, O and Cu elements can be detected in CNSX, suggesting that Cu 2 O is loaded on TiO 2 nanosheets successfully.The high-resolution Ti 2p spectra are displayed in Fig. 3a.The peaks of NS spectrum at 463.6 eV, 457.1 eV and 462.6 eV, 456.9 eV are corresponded to Ti 4 2p 1/2 , Ti 4 2p 3/2 and Ti 3 2p 1/2 , Ti 3 2p 3/2 , respectively 42.However, in the spectra of CNSX, the intensity of Ti 3 characteristic peaks gradually weakens and until disappears.Particularly, the Ti 2p spectra of CNSX can be fitted by added a group of peaks with higher binding energy (CNS1: 465.4 eV, 459.8 eV, CNS2: 465.7 eV, 459.9 eV and CNS3: 465.5 eV, 456.0 eV), which may be assigned to Ti 4 2p 1/2 and Ti 4 2p 3/2 43.It means that Ti 4 sites may act as the electron-deficient Ti sites (LA).Moreover, the electron binding energy of Ti in CNSX increases compared with that of in NS, demonstrating that Ti would loss electrons.The high-resolution Cu2p (Fig. 3b) and CuLMM spectra (Figure .S4b) of the samples depict the chemical state of Cu.A group of main peaks at 932.6 and 952.4 eV are observed in the spectra of Cu 2 O, belonging to Cu /Cu 0 2p 1/2 and 2p 3/2 .A peak at 916.6 eV is showed in CuLMM spectra, identifying that the Cu chemical state is Cu 44.Moreover, a small group of peaks at 934.5 and 954.3 eV could be assigned to Cu 2 2p 1/2 and Cu 2 2p 3/2 , respectively 45.The XPS spectra of CNSX exhibit a single group of peaks at 932.0, 951.4 eV (CNS1), 931.5, 952.8 eV (CNS2) and 931.4,951.0 eV (CNS3).According to the CuLMM spectra, the chemical state of Cu in the CNSX is considered as Cu .Compared with the binding energy of Cu in NS, a large shift toward the low-binding-energy side is observed in CNSX, suggesting that the electrons density of Cu increases greatly.Therefore, the electron-rich Cu 1- as a LB site may be appeared on CNSX.These XPS results reveal that the Cu -Ti 3 interface interaction may be generated via the charge transfer from Ti to Cu, which further causes the formation of electron-deficient Ti 4 sites (LA) and electron-rich Cu 1- (LB) sites on CNSX.The O chemical state of the samples is revealed by the high-resolution O1s XPS spectra (Figure . S4c, andd).The spectra could be deconvoluted into three peaks, which is identified as lattice oxygen (O1), hydroxyl (O2) and adsorbed oxygen (O3), respectively 46.EPR was used to further reveal the active sites (Fig. 3c).NS possess some Ti 3 , which could be inferred from the peaks at g value of 2.003 and 1.997 47.The peak at g value of 2.212 belongs to the Cu 2 defects with unpaired electrons in 3d orbitals.In additional, the peak at g value of 2.002 could be considered as the metallic Cu clusters because Cu obtains electrons from Ti 3 42.The peak at g value of 1.973 may be assigned to the unpaired electrons of other species formed by the charge transfer 48.This result may provide additional evidence for the Cu -Ti 3 interface interaction. Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) was carried out under H 2 atmosphere to further clear the type of metal oxide species and the interaction of Cu 2 O with TiO 2 .The H 2 -TPR profiles of the catalysts are presented in Fig. 3d.The reduction profile of NS shows a main peak at 510 C which might be attributed to the reduction of unsaturated Ti (such as Ti 3 ) 49.The peaks intensity at 510 C of CNSX reduction profile gradually weaken, which may be considered as the decrease of Ti 3 content.Moreover, three main peaks at 350(CNS1), 325(CNS2) and 309 C (CNS3) are observed in the profile, assigning to the reduction of Cu 50.The lowered reduction temperature reveals that the reduction Cu becomes easier, inferring that the Cu site obtain electrons from the Ti 3 site 51.These results further confirm that the electron-deficient Ti 4 sites (LA) and electron-rich Cu 1- (LB) sites is created successfully on CNSX. To verify whether the photocatalyst could exhibit the desired results, the performances of catalysts about photoreduction CO 2 were carried out in atmospheric pressure under Xe light irradiation without any sacrificial reagents under ( 360 nm) light irradiation.As shown in Fig. 7a, NS exhibits a high CH 4 yield (37.6 mol g -1 h -1 ) with a near 100 selectivity.However, when Cu 2 O is loaded, CO as a product is appeared.Two products of CH 4 (46.3 mol g -1 h -1 , 72) and CO (19.8 mol g -1 h -1 , 28) are generated on CNS1.The increase of CH 4 activity may be assigned to the improved the separation and transfer of the photogenerated carries by Cu 2 O loaded on CNS1.With the increase of Cu 2 O mass, the selectivity and activity of CO are gradually raised, whereas the yield of CH 4 gradually decreases.CNS3 shows the highest yield of CO (162.6 mol g -1 h -1 , 98).It is obvious that introducing Cu 2 O could improve the yield of CO, which may be attributed to the variation of CO 2 coordination mode.To further explore the optimal mass of loaded Cu 2 O, the catalysts with more Cu 2 O were prepared for photoreduction CO 2 .7 wt Cu 2 O/TiO 2 (CNS4) still exhibits a high selectivity of CO (96.5).However, H 2 as a product is appeared with a selectivity of 3.5.The yield of H 2 is kept for boosting when Cu 2 O mass is further increased.The selectivity of H 2 is up to 97.2 on 12 wt Cu 2 O/TiO 2 (CNS6).Therefore, 5 wt and 7 wt Cu 2 O may be the best loaded mass for optimal yield of CO. Moreover, in the Table S1, all the catalysts exhibit negligible photocatalytic activity in the absence of either H 2 O or light irradiation, indicating that the products (CH 4 and CO) are originated from CO 2 reduction.CO 2 was replaced by isotope 13 CO 2 to further confirm that the CH 4 and CO are produced by CO 2 photoreduction.In GC-MS results (Fig. 7b), the peak at the retention time of 0.7 and 1.7 min are belonged to 13 CO (m/z 29) and 13 CH 4 (m/z 17) respectively, indicating the generated products from CO 2 reduction. As an example, the stability of CNS3 was investigated via a 36-hours tests (Fig. S5).CNS3 can keep better yield of CO.To further explore the photostability of CNS3, the used photocatalyst is characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM (Fig. S6), and XPS (Fig. S7).These analyses show that the morphology structure and chemical property of the catalyst have negligible change.So, the catalysts keep the better photocatalytic stability. To unveil why the products selectivity of CH 4 and CO can be tailored, the coordination behavior of CO 2 on the catalysts has been explored through a serious of in situ characterization analysis.DRS was used to determine the catalyst optical property.The loaded Cu 2 O increase a little visible light sorption of the catalysts (Fig. S8).Furthermore, a special experimental phenomenon is observed when the CO 2 was injected into the reaction bottle with catalyst (CNSX) suspension.As shown in Fig. 4 inset, the color of CNSX would become yellow due to injected CO 2 but the catalysts keep white under Ar, showing that the adsorbed CO 2 would make the catalysts yellowing.Fig. 4a, b, c andd shows that CNSX could expand the absorption of visible light after absorption CO 2 because a charge transfer band between CO 2 and catalyst may be generated to absorb visible light 52,53.It means that abundant CO 2 molecules would be coordinated on the catalysts via the charge transfer, which would enhance the activity of CO 2 photoreduction. XPS was adopted to uncover the interaction between CO 2 and the active sites (Cu and Ti) via detecting the chemical state of each element in the catalysts after adsorption of CO 2 .As shown in Fig. S9, the high resolution C1s spectra of the catalysts reveal that only adventitious carbon peaks at 284.8 eV.After adsorption CO 2 , two peaks with higher binding energy (286.4 and 288.4 eV) can be added into the C1s spectra (Fig. 5a), which may be assigned to C-O and C--O of the adsorbed CO 2 , respectively.It is obvious that C-O components increase in CNSX, suggesting that the coordination mode of CO 2 may possess C-O bonds.Moreover, in Fig. 5b, the O1s spectra show that intensity of the peaks at about 532.0 obviously increase, corresponding to the C--O or C-O of the adsorbed CO 2 .The high resolution Ti2p spectra (Fig. 5c) show that the signals of Ti 4 disappear in CNSX after adsorption CO 2 .Meanwhile, the binding energy of Ti shifts toward to the lower binding energy, suggesting that the electron density of Ti increase.It could be concluded that Ti sites may obtain additional electrons from CO 2 .Fig. 5d shows that the Cu binding energy in CNSX is higher than that of the catalysts after adsorption CO 2 , inferring that the electron density of Cu decreases.It indicates that the electrons of Cu sites may be transferred into CO 2 .To further investigate binding and electron transfer between active sites and CO 2 molecules, in situ EPR measurement is carried out.The CO 2 adsorption on NS were explored in our previous work.So, the EPR spectra of CNSX before and after the adsorption of CO 2 are displayed in Fig. 6a.The g and A tensors (A for Cu of 137 G and g of 2.342) appear in spectra after adsorption CO 2 , demonstrating that CO 2 would be bind on the catalyst via the formation of Cu complex 54.The peak at 1.973 disappear, revealing that the unpaired electrons were redistributed on the catalysts surface due to the adsorbed CO 2 55.The Cu clusters signals at 2.002 also become weak after adsorption CO 2 , which may be attributed to the electrons transfer from Cu to CO 2 .Therefore, it determines that CO 2 molecule would be coordinated on the catalysts via the electrons transfer from Cu 1- to CO 2 and CO 2 to Ti 4 .Therefore, the bimetal bridging CuCO 2 Ti intermediate ( 1 - 2 ) may be formed on CNSX.In situ FT-IR was adopted out to further explore the coordination mode for CO 2 .As shown in Fig. 6b, the peaks at 1227 cm -1 could be assigned to the asymmetrical stretching vibration of C--O bond in bridging TiCO 2 -Ti species 15.With increasing the mass of loaded temperature reveals that the coordination species have changed.Based on above results, it could be concluded that the coordination mode on CNSX possesses C--O and C-O bonds.Moreover, the electrons transfer takes place between in CO 2 and active sites (OTi 4 and Cu 1- C).Hence, the bimetal bridging CuCO 2 Ti mode is generated assuredly on CNSX.Moreover, the bridging TiCO 2 -Ti mode would disappear on the catalysts but the bimetal bridging CuCO 2 Ti appear gradually with increasing the mass of Cu 2 O. Therefore, the products selectivity of CO and CH 4 could be governed effectively. Based on above results and discussion, a possible mechanism is discussed to elucidate CO and CH 4 generation pathway on the catalysts and further understand how the coordination mode determines the products selectivity.As shown in Fig. 8, under dark, CO 2 molecule would be bonded on the surface of catalyst.On NS surface, CO 2 can be absorbed via the formation of TiCO 2 -Ti intermediate which facilitates CH 4 generation.However, on CNSX surface, Cu -Ti 3 interface interaction results in the formation of electron-deficient Ti 4 sites (LA) and electron-rich Cu 1- (LB) sites.So, the bimetal bridging CuCO 2 Ti species is formed via the charge transfer from O (CO 2 ) to Ti 4 and Cu 1- to C. Because of this bidirectional charge transfer, the activated CO 2 molecule may keep electric neutrality, which impedes the protonation of CO 2 and further makes the product toward to the production of CO.In addition, in this intermediate, only one C--O coordinates with the active sites, implying that the activated C--O is easier to be dissociated for generating CO.Under light, the catalysts and the charge transfer band would be excited to fleetly produce the photogenerated electrons.Then the electrons are quickly transferred to the coordinated CO 2 via the coordination bond.Finally, the generated CO and CH 4 split away off the catalyst.Meanwhile, the photogenerated holes may be consumed to produce H 2 O 2 and O 2 , which is discussed in our previous work 14. In summary, the products selectivity of CH 4 and CO from photoreduction CO 2 is successfully controlled via creating Cu 2 O clusters/TiO 2 ultrathin nanosheet as a photocatalyst, which is profited from the Cu -Ti 3 interface interaction to tailor the coordination mode of CO 2 .The Cu -Ti 3 interface interaction causes the generation of Cu 1- and Ti 4 sites and elimination of Ti 3 via the charge transfer from Ti 3 to Cu .In this case, the bimetal bridging CuCO 2 Ti species with coordination bonds (OTi and CuC) would be formed on CNSX, which determines the formation CO.Moreover, loading Cu 2 O can improve the adsorption of visible light and the separation and transfer ability for generated carriers.The CO 2 coordination greatly increases the adsorption of visible light, which benefits from the excitation of the charge transfer band.The coordination bonds could accelerate the photogenerated electron transfer to CO 2 for generating the products.As a result, NS exhibits 100 selectivity of CH 4 (37.6 mol g -1 h -1 ) but CNS3 achieves 98 selectivity of CO (162.6 mol g -1 h -1 ).This work may provide a special horizon to tailor the products selectivity from photoreduction CO 2 via the interface interaction mediated the CO 2 coordination mode.

DRS of the samples before and after adsorption of CO 2 . , a new peak at 2080 cm -1 gradually appears in the spectra of CNSX but the peak at 1227 cm -1 disappears.It is reported that the peak (2080 cm -1 ) may be considered as the symmetrical stretching vibration (C--O) of the CO group56.Compared the vibration peak of C--O bond at 2365 cm -1 in free CO 2 , this peak (2080 cm -1 ) shifts to lower wavenumbers, implying that one C--O of CO 2 may be not involved in coordination.So, the bimetal bridging CuCO 2 Ti intermediate may be desorption of CO 2 (CO 2 -TPD) was used to further distinguish the bridging TiCO 2 -Ti and bimetal bridging CuCO 2 Ti intermediate.Each sample only exhibits a main desorption peak at 214 (NS), 208 (CNS1), 198 (CNS2) and 178 C (CNS3) in Fig. 6c, assigning to the adsorption CO 2 species.The hapticity of bridging TiCO 2 -Ti intermediate ( 2 - 4 ) is higher than that of the bimetal bridging CuCO 2 Ti ( 1 - 2 ), suggesting that TiCO 2 -Ti is more stable than CuCO 2 Ti 57.Therefore, the decreased desorption Fig. 5.

The CO 2 photoreduction experiments were performed in a 45 mL glass bottle at ambient temperature (Fig. S1). 10 mg of catalyst was dispersed in 20 mL of pure water by sonication to get pulp suspension.This system was treated with vacuum degassing and then refilled with pure CO 2 gas (99.999) for 5 times.The photocatalytic reaction was carried out for 6 h with UV-vis-light irradiation (PLS-SXE300D, 1000 mW/cm 2 , Beijing Perfectlight Co., Ltd. 360 nm).After photoreaction, 0.4 mL of mixed gas was taken from the reactor to analyze the gas concentration of the product using a gas chromatography (GC-7890B, Agilent) equipped with a TCD, an FID detector and a chromatographic column (MolSieve 5 A).The isotopic 13 CO 2 experiment was analyzed by an Agilent GC-MS analyzer with 5977B MSD mass spectrometer. The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was adopted to determine the crystal phases of the prepared samples.As shown in Fig. 1a, the diffraction patterns of all samples show the characteristic diffraction peaks of anatase TiO 2 (JCPDS No: 65-5714) 31.The diffraction patterns of CNSX display three diffraction peaks at 36.4 , 42.3 and 61.4 can be well assigned to the (111), ( 200) and (220) crystal facets of cubic Cu 2 O (JCPDS No: 05-0667), suggesting that the samples consist of the Cu 2 O/TiO 2 (anatase) 32.In addition, a small shift to high angle of the lattice plane (101) is observed in the diffraction patterns of CNSX (Fig. 1b) compared to NS, inferring that the strong interaction between Cu 2 O and TiO 2 33.The prepared catalysts with an ultra-thin structure (3.2 nm) could be demonstrated by SEM, TEM and AFM images in Fig. 1c, d ande.The DRS spectra (Figure .S2a) depict that the Cu 2 O sample spectrum has an obvious blue shift compared with spectrum of standard Cu 2 O due to quantum scale effect, suggesting that the diameter of Cu 2 O is up to nanoscale.Furthermore, a high dispersed nano-clusters with 2 nm diameter can be obviously found in the TEM and HADDF images (Fig. 1e andf).The HRTEM image (Fig. 2a) exhibits two kinds of the lattice stripes with 0.35 and 0.24 nm, corresponding to the lattice planes (101) of anatase TiO 2 and (111) of Cu 2 O, respectively 343536.The distinct selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Fig. 2b) shows the polycrystalline anatase phase of the sample.In addition, mapping images (Fig. 2c) further reveal that the Cu element is uniformly distributed on the TiO 2 nanosheets.So, it means that the Cu 2 O clusters/TiO 2 ultrathin nanosheets (CNSX) with a thickness of 4 TiO 2 cells are successfully created 37. N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherm (Figure .S2b) reveals that the specific surface area of all the samples is about 90 m 2 /g, which may offer abundant active sites on the surface to adsorb more CO 2 molecule for improving the photocatalytic activity 38.The separation and transfer ability for photogenerated electrons-holes of the prepared samples was valued by the transient photocurrent response, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and PL (Figure . S3 a, b andc).The photo-response current of the catalysts (NS: 11.5, CNS1: 22.3, CNS2: 40.2 and CNS3: 49.3 Acm -2 ) gradually increase with adding the loading-mass of Cu 2 O, revealing that Cu 2 O could accelerate the separation and transfer ability for carries 39.The EIS and PL analysis also can give an assistance for this result 40.It may be attributed to the generated direct Z-scheme heterostructure in Fig. S12 41. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to detect the chemical composition and the chemical state of each element for unveiling whether the preconceived active sites are exposed on the prepared samples.The XPS survey (Figure .S4a) shows that Ti, O and Cu elements can be detected in CNSX, suggesting that Cu 2 O is loaded on TiO 2 nanosheets successfully.The high-resolution Ti 2p spectra are displayed in Fig. 3a.The peaks of NS spectrum at 463.6 eV, 457.1 eV and 462.6 eV, 456.9 eV are corresponded to Ti 4 2p 1/2 , Ti 4 2p 3/2 and Ti 3 2p 1/2 , Ti 3 2p 3/2 , respectively 42.However, in the spectra of CNSX, the intensity of Ti 3 characteristic peaks gradually weakens and until disappears.Particularly, the Ti 2p spectra of CNSX can be fitted by added a group of peaks with higher binding energy (CNS1: 465.4 eV, 459.8 eV, CNS2: 465.7 eV, 459.9 eV and CNS3: 465.5 eV, 456.0 eV), which may be assigned to Ti 4 2p 1/2 and Ti 4 2p 3/2 43.It means that Ti 4 sites may act as the electron-deficient Ti sites (LA).Moreover, the electron binding energy of Ti in CNSX increases compared with that of in NS, demonstrating that Ti would loss electrons.The high-resolution Cu2p (Fig. 3b) and CuLMM spectra (Figure .S4b) of the samples depict the chemical state of Cu.A group of main peaks at 932.6 and 952.4 eV are observed in the spectra of Cu 2 O, belonging to Cu /Cu 0 2p 1/2 and 2p 3/2 .A peak at 916.6 eV is showed in CuLMM spectra, identifying that the Cu chemical state is Cu 44.Moreover, a small group of peaks at 934.5 and 954.3 eV could be assigned to Cu 2 2p 1/2 and Cu 2 2p 3/2 , respectively 45.The XPS spectra of CNSX exhibit a single group of peaks at 932.0, 951.4 eV (CNS1), 931.5, 952.8 eV (CNS2) and 931.4,951.0 eV (CNS3).According to the CuLMM spectra, the chemical state of Cu in the CNSX is considered as Cu .Compared with the binding energy of Cu in NS, a large shift toward the low-binding-energy side is observed in CNSX, suggesting that the electrons density of Cu increases greatly.Therefore, the electron-rich Cu 1- as a LB site may be appeared on CNSX.These XPS results reveal that the Cu -Ti 3 interface interaction may be generated via the charge transfer from Ti to Cu, which further causes the formation of electron-deficient Ti 4 sites (LA) and electron-rich Cu 1- (LB) sites on CNSX.The O chemical state of the samples is revealed by the high-resolution O1s XPS spectra (Figure . S4c, andd).The spectra could be deconvoluted into three peaks, which is identified as lattice oxygen (O1), hydroxyl (O2) and adsorbed oxygen (O3), respectively 46.EPR was used to further reveal the active sites (Fig. 3c).NS possess some Ti 3 , which could be inferred from the peaks at g value of 2.003 and 1.997 47.The peak at g value of 2.212 belongs to the Cu 2 defects with unpaired electrons in 3d orbitals.In additional, the peak at g value of 2.002 could be considered as the metallic Cu clusters because Cu obtains electrons from Ti 3 42.The peak at g value of 1.973 may be assigned to the unpaired electrons of other species formed by the charge transfer 48.This result may provide additional evidence for the Cu -Ti 3 interface interaction. Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) was carried out under H 2 atmosphere to further clear the type of metal oxide species and the interaction of Cu 2 O with TiO 2 .The H 2 -TPR profiles of the catalysts are presented in Fig. 3d.The reduction profile of NS shows a main peak at 510 C which might be attributed to the reduction of unsaturated Ti (such as Ti 3 ) 49.The peaks intensity at 510 C of CNSX reduction profile gradually weaken, which may be considered as the decrease of Ti 3 content.Moreover, three main peaks at 350(CNS1), 325(CNS2) and 309 C (CNS3) are observed in the profile, assigning to the reduction of Cu 50.The lowered reduction temperature reveals that the reduction Cu becomes easier, inferring that the Cu site obtain electrons from the Ti 3 site 51.These results further confirm that the electron-deficient Ti 4 sites (LA) and electron-rich Cu 1- (LB) sites is created successfully on CNSX. To verify whether the photocatalyst could exhibit the desired results, the performances of catalysts about photoreduction CO 2 were carried out in atmospheric pressure under Xe light irradiation without any sacrificial reagents under ( 360 nm) light irradiation.As shown in Fig. 7a, NS exhibits a high CH 4 yield (37.6 mol g -1 h -1 ) with a near 100 selectivity.However, when Cu 2 O is loaded, CO as a product is appeared.Two products of CH 4 (46.3 mol g -1 h -1 , 72) and CO (19.8 mol g -1 h -1 , 28) are generated on CNS1.The increase of CH 4 activity may be assigned to the improved the separation and transfer of the photogenerated carries by Cu 2 O loaded on CNS1.With the increase of Cu 2 O mass, the selectivity and activity of CO are gradually raised, whereas the yield of CH 4 gradually decreases.CNS3 shows the highest yield of CO (162.6 mol g -1 h -1 , 98).It is obvious that introducing Cu 2 O could improve the yield of CO, which may be attributed to the variation of CO 2 coordination mode.To further explore the optimal mass of loaded Cu 2 O, the catalysts with more Cu 2 O were prepared for photoreduction CO 2 .7 wt Cu 2 O/TiO 2 (CNS4) still exhibits a high selectivity of CO (96.5).However, H 2 as a product is appeared with a selectivity of 3.5.The yield of H 2 is kept for boosting when Cu 2 O mass is further increased.The selectivity of H 2 is up to 97.2 on 12 wt Cu 2 O/TiO 2 (CNS6).Therefore, 5 wt and 7 wt Cu 2 O may be the best loaded mass for optimal yield of CO. Moreover, in the Table S1, all the catalysts exhibit negligible photocatalytic activity in the absence of either H 2 O or light irradiation, indicating that the products (CH 4 and CO) are originated from CO 2 reduction.CO 2 was replaced by isotope 13 CO 2 to further confirm that the CH 4 and CO are produced by CO 2 photoreduction.In GC-MS results (Fig. 7b), the peak at the retention time of 0.7 and 1.7 min are belonged to 13 CO (m/z 29) and 13 CH 4 (m/z 17) respectively, indicating the generated products from CO 2 reduction. As an example, the stability of CNS3 was investigated via a 36-hours tests (Fig. S5).CNS3 can keep better yield of CO.To further explore the photostability of CNS3, the used photocatalyst is characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM (Fig. S6), and XPS (Fig. S7).These analyses show that the morphology structure and chemical property of the catalyst have negligible change.So, the catalysts keep the better photocatalytic stability. To unveil why the products selectivity of CH 4 and CO can be tailored, the coordination behavior of CO 2 on the catalysts has been explored through a serious of in situ characterization analysis.DRS was used to determine the catalyst optical property.The loaded Cu 2 O increase a little visible light sorption of the catalysts (Fig. S8).Furthermore, a special experimental phenomenon is observed when the CO 2 was injected into the reaction bottle with catalyst (CNSX) suspension.As shown in Fig. 4 inset, the color of CNSX would become yellow due to injected CO 2 but the catalysts keep white under Ar, showing that the adsorbed CO 2 would make the catalysts yellowing.Fig. 4a, b, c andd shows that CNSX could expand the absorption of visible light after absorption CO 2 because a charge transfer band between CO 2 and catalyst may be generated to absorb visible light 52,53.It means that abundant CO 2 molecules would be coordinated on the catalysts via the charge transfer, which would enhance the activity of CO 2 photoreduction. XPS was adopted to uncover the interaction between CO 2 and the active sites (Cu and Ti) via detecting the chemical state of each element in the catalysts after adsorption of CO 2 .As shown in Fig. S9, the high resolution C1s spectra of the catalysts reveal that only adventitious carbon peaks at 284.8 eV.After adsorption CO 2 , two peaks with higher binding energy (286.4 and 288.4 eV) can be added into the C1s spectra (Fig. 5a), which may be assigned to C-O and C--O of the adsorbed CO 2 , respectively.It is obvious that C-O components increase in CNSX, suggesting that the coordination mode of CO 2 may possess C-O bonds.Moreover, in Fig. 5b, the O1s spectra show that intensity of the peaks at about 532.0 obviously increase, corresponding to the C--O or C-O of the adsorbed CO 2 .The high resolution Ti2p spectra (Fig. 5c) show that the signals of Ti 4 disappear in CNSX after adsorption CO 2 .Meanwhile, the binding energy of Ti shifts toward to the lower binding energy, suggesting that the electron density of Ti increase.It could be concluded that Ti sites may obtain additional electrons from CO 2 .Fig. 5d shows that the Cu binding energy in CNSX is higher than that of the catalysts after adsorption CO 2 , inferring that the electron density of Cu decreases.It indicates that the electrons of Cu sites may be transferred into CO 2 .To further investigate binding and electron transfer between active sites and CO 2 molecules, in situ EPR measurement is carried out.The CO 2 adsorption on NS were explored in our previous work.So, the EPR spectra of CNSX before and after the adsorption of CO 2 are displayed in Fig. 6a.The g and A tensors (A for Cu of 137 G and g of 2.342) appear in spectra after adsorption CO 2 , demonstrating that CO 2 would be bind on the catalyst via the formation of Cu complex 54.The peak at 1.973 disappear, revealing that the unpaired electrons were redistributed on the catalysts surface due to the adsorbed CO 2 55.The Cu clusters signals at 2.002 also become weak after adsorption CO 2 , which may be attributed to the electrons transfer from Cu to CO 2 .Therefore, it determines that CO 2 molecule would be coordinated on the catalysts via the electrons transfer from Cu 1- to CO 2 and CO 2 to Ti 4 .Therefore, the bimetal bridging CuCO 2 Ti intermediate ( 1 - 2 ) may be formed on CNSX.In situ FT-IR was adopted out to further explore the coordination mode for CO 2 .As shown in Fig. 6b, the peaks at 1227 cm -1 could be assigned to the asymmetrical stretching vibration of C--O bond in bridging TiCO 2 -Ti species 15.With increasing the mass of loaded temperature reveals that the coordination species have changed.Based on above results, it could be concluded that the coordination mode on CNSX possesses C--O and C-O bonds.Moreover, the electrons transfer takes place between in CO 2 and active sites (OTi 4 and Cu 1- C).Hence, the bimetal bridging CuCO 2 Ti mode is generated assuredly on CNSX.Moreover, the bridging TiCO 2 -Ti mode would disappear on the catalysts but the bimetal bridging CuCO 2 Ti appear gradually with increasing the mass of Cu 2 O. Therefore, the products selectivity of CO and CH 4 could be governed effectively. Based on above results and discussion, a possible mechanism is discussed to elucidate CO and CH 4 generation pathway on the catalysts and further understand how the coordination mode determines the products selectivity.As shown in Fig. 8, under dark, CO 2 molecule would be bonded on the surface of catalyst.On NS surface, CO 2 can be absorbed via the formation of TiCO 2 -Ti intermediate which facilitates CH 4 generation.However, on CNSX surface, Cu -Ti 3 interface interaction results in the formation of electron-deficient Ti 4 sites (LA) and electron-rich Cu 1- (LB) sites.So, the bimetal bridging CuCO 2 Ti species is formed via the charge transfer from O (CO 2 ) to Ti 4 and Cu 1- to C. Because of this bidirectional charge transfer, the activated CO 2 molecule may keep electric neutrality, which impedes the protonation of CO 2 and further makes the product toward to the production of CO.In addition, in this intermediate, only one C--O coordinates with the active sites, implying that the activated C--O is easier to be dissociated for generating CO.Under light, the catalysts and the charge transfer band would be excited to fleetly produce the photogenerated electrons.Then the electrons are quickly transferred to the coordinated CO 2 via the coordination bond.Finally, the generated CO and CH 4 split away off the catalyst.Meanwhile, the photogenerated holes may be consumed to produce H 2 O 2 and O 2 , which is discussed in our previous work 14. In summary, the products selectivity of CH 4 and CO from photoreduction CO 2 is successfully controlled via creating Cu 2 O clusters/TiO 2 ultrathin nanosheet as a photocatalyst, which is profited from the Cu -Ti 3 interface interaction to tailor the coordination mode of CO 2 .The Cu -Ti 3 interface interaction causes the generation of Cu 1- and Ti 4 sites and elimination of Ti 3 via the charge transfer from Ti 3 to Cu .In this case, the bimetal bridging CuCO 2 Ti species with coordination bonds (OTi and CuC) would be formed on CNSX, which determines the formation CO.Moreover, loading Cu 2 O can improve the adsorption of visible light and the separation and transfer ability for generated carriers.The CO 2 coordination greatly increases the adsorption of visible light, which benefits from the excitation of the charge transfer band.The coordination bonds could accelerate the photogenerated electron transfer to CO 2 for generating the products.As a result, NS exhibits 100 selectivity of CH 4 (37.6 mol g -1 h -1 ) but CNS3 achieves 98 selectivity of CO (162.6 mol g -1 h -1 ).This work may provide a special horizon to tailor the products selectivity from photoreduction CO 2 via the interface interaction mediated the CO 2 coordination mode.

DRS of the samples before and after adsorption of CO 2 . , a new peak at 2080 cm -1 gradually appears in the spectra of CNSX but the peak at 1227 cm -1 disappears.It is reported that the peak (2080 cm -1 ) may be considered as the symmetrical stretching vibration (C--O) of the CO group56.Compared the vibration peak of C--O bond at 2365 cm -1 in free CO 2 , this peak (2080 cm -1 ) shifts to lower wavenumbers, implying that one C--O of CO 2 may be not involved in coordination.So, the bimetal bridging CuCO 2 Ti intermediate may be desorption of CO 2 (CO 2 -TPD) was used to further distinguish the bridging TiCO 2 -Ti and bimetal bridging CuCO 2 Ti intermediate.Each sample only exhibits a main desorption peak at 214 (NS), 208 (CNS1), 198 (CNS2) and 178 C (CNS3) in Fig. 6c, assigning to the adsorption CO 2 species.The hapticity of bridging TiCO 2 -Ti intermediate ( 2 - 4 ) is higher than that of the bimetal bridging CuCO 2 Ti ( 1 - 2 ), suggesting that TiCO 2 -Ti is more stable than CuCO 2 Ti 57.Therefore, the decreased desorption Fig. 5.

N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherm (Figure .S2b) reveals that the specific surface area of all the samples is about 90 m 2 /g, which may offer abundant active sites on the surface to adsorb more CO 2 molecule for improving the photocatalytic activity 38.The separation and transfer ability for photogenerated electrons-holes of the prepared samples was valued by the transient photocurrent response, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and PL (Figure . S3 a, b andc).The photo-response current of the catalysts (NS: 11.5, CNS1: 22.3, CNS2: 40.2 and CNS3: 49.3 Acm -2 ) gradually increase with adding the loading-mass of Cu 2 O, revealing that Cu 2 O could accelerate the separation and transfer ability for carries 39.The EIS and PL analysis also can give an assistance for this result 40.It may be attributed to the generated direct Z-scheme heterostructure in Fig. S12 41. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to detect the chemical composition and the chemical state of each element for unveiling whether the preconceived active sites are exposed on the prepared samples.The XPS survey (Figure .S4a) shows that Ti, O and Cu elements can be detected in CNSX, suggesting that Cu 2 O is loaded on TiO 2 nanosheets successfully.The high-resolution Ti 2p spectra are displayed in Fig. 3a.The peaks of NS spectrum at 463.6 eV, 457.1 eV and 462.6 eV, 456.9 eV are corresponded to Ti 4 2p 1/2 , Ti 4 2p 3/2 and Ti 3 2p 1/2 , Ti 3 2p 3/2 , respectively 42.However, in the spectra of CNSX, the intensity of Ti 3 characteristic peaks gradually weakens and until disappears.Particularly, the Ti 2p spectra of CNSX can be fitted by added a group of peaks with higher binding energy (CNS1: 465.4 eV, 459.8 eV, CNS2: 465.7 eV, 459.9 eV and CNS3: 465.5 eV, 456.0 eV), which may be assigned to Ti 4 2p 1/2 and Ti 4 2p 3/2 43.It means that Ti 4 sites may act as the electron-deficient Ti sites (LA).Moreover, the electron binding energy of Ti in CNSX increases compared with that of in NS, demonstrating that Ti would loss electrons.The high-resolution Cu2p (Fig. 3b) and CuLMM spectra (Figure .S4b) of the samples depict the chemical state of Cu.A group of main peaks at 932.6 and 952.4 eV are observed in the spectra of Cu 2 O, belonging to Cu /Cu 0 2p 1/2 and 2p 3/2 .A peak at 916.6 eV is showed in CuLMM spectra, identifying that the Cu chemical state is Cu 44.Moreover, a small group of peaks at 934.5 and 954.3 eV could be assigned to Cu 2 2p 1/2 and Cu 2 2p 3/2 , respectively 45.The XPS spectra of CNSX exhibit a single group of peaks at 932.0, 951.4 eV (CNS1), 931.5, 952.8 eV (CNS2) and 931.4,951.0 eV (CNS3).According to the CuLMM spectra, the chemical state of Cu in the CNSX is considered as Cu .Compared with the binding energy of Cu in NS, a large shift toward the low-binding-energy side is observed in CNSX, suggesting that the electrons density of Cu increases greatly.Therefore, the electron-rich Cu 1- as a LB site may be appeared on CNSX.These XPS results reveal that the Cu -Ti 3 interface interaction may be generated via the charge transfer from Ti to Cu, which further causes the formation of electron-deficient Ti 4 sites (LA) and electron-rich Cu 1- (LB) sites on CNSX.The O chemical state of the samples is revealed by the high-resolution O1s XPS spectra (Figure . S4c, andd).The spectra could be deconvoluted into three peaks, which is identified as lattice oxygen (O1), hydroxyl (O2) and adsorbed oxygen (O3), respectively 46.EPR was used to further reveal the active sites (Fig. 3c).NS possess some Ti 3 , which could be inferred from the peaks at g value of 2.003 and 1.997 47.The peak at g value of 2.212 belongs to the Cu 2 defects with unpaired electrons in 3d orbitals.In additional, the peak at g value of 2.002 could be considered as the metallic Cu clusters because Cu obtains electrons from Ti 3 42.The peak at g value of 1.973 may be assigned to the unpaired electrons of other species formed by the charge transfer 48.This result may provide additional evidence for the Cu -Ti 3 interface interaction. Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) was carried out under H 2 atmosphere to further clear the type of metal oxide species and the interaction of Cu 2 O with TiO 2 .The H 2 -TPR profiles of the catalysts are presented in Fig. 3d.The reduction profile of NS shows a main peak at 510 C which might be attributed to the reduction of unsaturated Ti (such as Ti 3 ) 49.The peaks intensity at 510 C of CNSX reduction profile gradually weaken, which may be considered as the decrease of Ti 3 content.Moreover, three main peaks at 350(CNS1), 325(CNS2) and 309 C (CNS3) are observed in the profile, assigning to the reduction of Cu 50.The lowered reduction temperature reveals that the reduction Cu becomes easier, inferring that the Cu site obtain electrons from the Ti 3 site 51.These results further confirm that the electron-deficient Ti 4 sites (LA) and electron-rich Cu 1- (LB) sites is created successfully on CNSX. To verify whether the photocatalyst could exhibit the desired results, the performances of catalysts about photoreduction CO 2 were carried out in atmospheric pressure under Xe light irradiation without any sacrificial reagents under ( 360 nm) light irradiation.As shown in Fig. 7a, NS exhibits a high CH 4 yield (37.6 mol g -1 h -1 ) with a near 100 selectivity.However, when Cu 2 O is loaded, CO as a product is appeared.Two products of CH 4 (46.3 mol g -1 h -1 , 72) and CO (19.8 mol g -1 h -1 , 28) are generated on CNS1.The increase of CH 4 activity may be assigned to the improved the separation and transfer of the photogenerated carries by Cu 2 O loaded on CNS1.With the increase of Cu 2 O mass, the selectivity and activity of CO are gradually raised, whereas the yield of CH 4 gradually decreases.CNS3 shows the highest yield of CO (162.6 mol g -1 h -1 , 98).It is obvious that introducing Cu 2 O could improve the yield of CO, which may be attributed to the variation of CO 2 coordination mode.To further explore the optimal mass of loaded Cu 2 O, the catalysts with more Cu 2 O were prepared for photoreduction CO 2 .7 wt Cu 2 O/TiO 2 (CNS4) still exhibits a high selectivity of CO (96.5).However, H 2 as a product is appeared with a selectivity of 3.5.The yield of H 2 is kept for boosting when Cu 2 O mass is further increased.The selectivity of H 2 is up to 97.2 on 12 wt Cu 2 O/TiO 2 (CNS6).Therefore, 5 wt and 7 wt Cu 2 O may be the best loaded mass for optimal yield of CO. Moreover, in the Table S1, all the catalysts exhibit negligible photocatalytic activity in the absence of either H 2 O or light irradiation, indicating that the products (CH 4 and CO) are originated from CO 2 reduction.CO 2 was replaced by isotope 13 CO 2 to further confirm that the CH 4 and CO are produced by CO 2 photoreduction.In GC-MS results (Fig. 7b), the peak at the retention time of 0.7 and 1.7 min are belonged to 13 CO (m/z 29) and 13 CH 4 (m/z 17) respectively, indicating the generated products from CO 2 reduction. As an example, the stability of CNS3 was investigated via a 36-hours tests (Fig. S5).CNS3 can keep better yield of CO.To further explore the photostability of CNS3, the used photocatalyst is characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM (Fig. S6), and XPS (Fig. S7).These analyses show that the morphology structure and chemical property of the catalyst have negligible change.So, the catalysts keep the better photocatalytic stability.

XPS was adopted to uncover the interaction between CO 2 and the active sites (Cu and Ti) via detecting the chemical state of each element in the catalysts after adsorption of CO 2 .As shown in Fig. S9, the high resolution C1s spectra of the catalysts reveal that only adventitious carbon peaks at 284.8 eV.After adsorption CO 2 , two peaks with higher binding energy (286.4 and 288.4 eV) can be added into the C1s spectra (Fig. 5a), which may be assigned to C-O and C--O of the adsorbed CO 2 , respectively.It is obvious that C-O components increase in CNSX, suggesting that the coordination mode of CO 2 may possess C-O bonds.Moreover, in Fig. 5b, the O1s spectra show that intensity of the peaks at about 532.0 obviously increase, corresponding to the C--O or C-O of the adsorbed CO 2 .The high resolution Ti2p spectra (Fig. 5c) show that the signals of Ti 4 disappear in CNSX after adsorption CO 2 .Meanwhile, the binding energy of Ti shifts toward to the lower binding energy, suggesting that the electron density of Ti increase.It could be concluded that Ti sites may obtain additional electrons from CO 2 .Fig. 5d shows that the Cu binding energy in CNSX is higher than that of the catalysts after adsorption CO 2 , inferring that the electron density of Cu decreases.It indicates that the electrons of Cu sites may be transferred into CO 2 .To further investigate binding and electron transfer between active sites and CO 2 molecules, in situ EPR measurement is carried out.The CO 2 adsorption on NS were explored in our previous work.So, the EPR spectra of CNSX before and after the adsorption of CO 2 are displayed in Fig. 6a.The g and A tensors (A for Cu of 137 G and g of 2.342) appear in spectra after adsorption CO 2 , demonstrating that CO 2 would be bind on the catalyst via the formation of Cu complex 54.The peak at 1.973 disappear, revealing that the unpaired electrons were redistributed on the catalysts surface due to the adsorbed CO 2 55.The Cu clusters signals at 2.002 also become weak after adsorption CO 2 , which may be attributed to the electrons transfer from Cu to CO 2 .Therefore, it determines that CO 2 molecule would be coordinated on the catalysts via the electrons transfer from Cu 1- to CO 2 and CO 2 to Ti 4 .Therefore, the bimetal bridging CuCO 2 Ti intermediate ( 1 - 2 ) may be formed on CNSX.In situ FT-IR was adopted out to further explore the coordination mode for CO 2 .As shown in Fig. 6b, the peaks at 1227 cm -1 could be assigned to the asymmetrical stretching vibration of C--O bond in bridging TiCO 2 -Ti species 15.With increasing the mass of loaded temperature reveals that the coordination species have changed.Based on above results, it could be concluded that the coordination mode on CNSX possesses C--O and C-O bonds.Moreover, the electrons transfer takes place between in CO 2 and active sites (OTi 4 and Cu 1- C).Hence, the bimetal bridging CuCO 2 Ti mode is generated assuredly on CNSX.Moreover, the bridging TiCO 2 -Ti mode would disappear on the catalysts but the bimetal bridging CuCO 2 Ti appear gradually with increasing the mass of Cu 2 O. Therefore, the products selectivity of CO and CH 4 could be governed effectively. Based on above results and discussion, a possible mechanism is discussed to elucidate CO and CH 4 generation pathway on the catalysts and further understand how the coordination mode determines the products selectivity.As shown in Fig. 8, under dark, CO 2 molecule would be bonded on the surface of catalyst.On NS surface, CO 2 can be absorbed via the formation of TiCO 2 -Ti intermediate which facilitates CH 4 generation.However, on CNSX surface, Cu -Ti 3 interface interaction results in the formation of electron-deficient Ti 4 sites (LA) and electron-rich Cu 1- (LB) sites.So, the bimetal bridging CuCO 2 Ti species is formed via the charge transfer from O (CO 2 ) to Ti 4 and Cu 1- to C.

The CO 2 photoreduction experiments were performed in a 45 mL glass bottle at ambient temperature (Fig. S1). 10 mg of catalyst was dispersed in 20 mL of pure water by sonication to get pulp suspension.This system was treated with vacuum degassing and then refilled with pure CO 2 gas (99.999) for 5 times.The photocatalytic reaction was carried out for 6 h with UV-vis-light irradiation (PLS-SXE300D, 1000 mW/cm 2 , Beijing Perfectlight Co., Ltd. 360 nm).After photoreaction, 0.4 mL of mixed gas was taken from the reactor to analyze the gas concentration of the product using a gas chromatography (GC-7890B, Agilent) equipped with a TCD, an FID detector and a chromatographic column (MolSieve 5 A).The isotopic 13 CO 2 experiment was analyzed by an Agilent GC-MS analyzer with 5977B MSD mass spectrometer. The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was adopted to determine the crystal phases of the prepared samples.As shown in Fig. 1a, the diffraction patterns of all samples show the characteristic diffraction peaks of anatase TiO 2 (JCPDS No: 65-5714) 31.The diffraction patterns of CNSX display three diffraction peaks at 36.4 , 42.3 and 61.4 can be well assigned to the (111), ( 200) and (220) crystal facets of cubic Cu 2 O (JCPDS No: 05-0667), suggesting that the samples consist of the Cu 2 O/TiO 2 (anatase) 32.In addition, a small shift to high angle of the lattice plane (101) is observed in the diffraction patterns of CNSX (Fig. 1b) compared to NS, inferring that the strong interaction between Cu 2 O and TiO 2 33.The prepared catalysts with an ultra-thin structure (3.2 nm) could be demonstrated by SEM, TEM and AFM images in Fig. 1c, d ande.The DRS spectra (Figure .S2a) depict that the Cu 2 O sample spectrum has an obvious blue shift compared with spectrum of standard Cu 2 O due to quantum scale effect, suggesting that the diameter of Cu 2 O is up to nanoscale.Furthermore, a high dispersed nano-clusters with 2 nm diameter can be obviously found in the TEM and HADDF images (Fig. 1e andf).The HRTEM image (Fig. 2a) exhibits two kinds of the lattice stripes with 0.35 and 0.24 nm, corresponding to the lattice planes (101) of anatase TiO 2 and (111) of Cu 2 O, respectively 343536.The distinct selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Fig. 2b) shows the polycrystalline anatase phase of the sample.In addition, mapping images (Fig. 2c) further reveal that the Cu element is uniformly distributed on the TiO 2 nanosheets.So, it means that the Cu 2 O clusters/TiO 2 ultrathin nanosheets (CNSX) with a thickness of 4 TiO 2 cells are successfully created 37. N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherm (Figure .S2b) reveals that the specific surface area of all the samples is about 90 m 2 /g, which may offer abundant active sites on the surface to adsorb more CO 2 molecule for improving the photocatalytic activity 38.The separation and transfer ability for photogenerated electrons-holes of the prepared samples was valued by the transient photocurrent response, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and PL (Figure . S3 a, b andc).The photo-response current of the catalysts (NS: 11.5, CNS1: 22.3, CNS2: 40.2 and CNS3: 49.3 Acm -2 ) gradually increase with adding the loading-mass of Cu 2 O, revealing that Cu 2 O could accelerate the separation and transfer ability for carries 39.The EIS and PL analysis also can give an assistance for this result 40.It may be attributed to the generated direct Z-scheme heterostructure in Fig. S12 41. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to detect the chemical composition and the chemical state of each element for unveiling whether the preconceived active sites are exposed on the prepared samples.The XPS survey (Figure .S4a) shows that Ti, O and Cu elements can be detected in CNSX, suggesting that Cu 2 O is loaded on TiO 2 nanosheets successfully.The high-resolution Ti 2p spectra are displayed in Fig. 3a.The peaks of NS spectrum at 463.6 eV, 457.1 eV and 462.6 eV, 456.9 eV are corresponded to Ti 4 2p 1/2 , Ti 4 2p 3/2 and Ti 3 2p 1/2 , Ti 3 2p 3/2 , respectively 42.However, in the spectra of CNSX, the intensity of Ti 3 characteristic peaks gradually weakens and until disappears.Particularly, the Ti 2p spectra of CNSX can be fitted by added a group of peaks with higher binding energy (CNS1: 465.4 eV, 459.8 eV, CNS2: 465.7 eV, 459.9 eV and CNS3: 465.5 eV, 456.0 eV), which may be assigned to Ti 4 2p 1/2 and Ti 4 2p 3/2 43.It means that Ti 4 sites may act as the electron-deficient Ti sites (LA).Moreover, the electron binding energy of Ti in CNSX increases compared with that of in NS, demonstrating that Ti would loss electrons.The high-resolution Cu2p (Fig. 3b) and CuLMM spectra (Figure .S4b) of the samples depict the chemical state of Cu.A group of main peaks at 932.6 and 952.4 eV are observed in the spectra of Cu 2 O, belonging to Cu /Cu 0 2p 1/2 and 2p 3/2 .A peak at 916.6 eV is showed in CuLMM spectra, identifying that the Cu chemical state is Cu 44.Moreover, a small group of peaks at 934.5 and 954.3 eV could be assigned to Cu 2 2p 1/2 and Cu 2 2p 3/2 , respectively 45.The XPS spectra of CNSX exhibit a single group of peaks at 932.0, 951.4 eV (CNS1), 931.5, 952.8 eV (CNS2) and 931.4,951.0 eV (CNS3).According to the CuLMM spectra, the chemical state of Cu in the CNSX is considered as Cu .Compared with the binding energy of Cu in NS, a large shift toward the low-binding-energy side is observed in CNSX, suggesting that the electrons density of Cu increases greatly.Therefore, the electron-rich Cu 1- as a LB site may be appeared on CNSX.These XPS results reveal that the Cu -Ti 3 interface interaction may be generated via the charge transfer from Ti to Cu, which further causes the formation of electron-deficient Ti 4 sites (LA) and electron-rich Cu 1- (LB) sites on CNSX.The O chemical state of the samples is revealed by the high-resolution O1s XPS spectra (Figure . S4c, andd).The spectra could be deconvoluted into three peaks, which is identified as lattice oxygen (O1), hydroxyl (O2) and adsorbed oxygen (O3), respectively 46.EPR was used to further reveal the active sites (Fig. 3c).NS possess some Ti 3 , which could be inferred from the peaks at g value of 2.003 and 1.997 47.The peak at g value of 2.212 belongs to the Cu 2 defects with unpaired electrons in 3d orbitals.In additional, the peak at g value of 2.002 could be considered as the metallic Cu clusters because Cu obtains electrons from Ti 3 42.The peak at g value of 1.973 may be assigned to the unpaired electrons of other species formed by the charge transfer 48.This result may provide additional evidence for the Cu -Ti 3 interface interaction. Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) was carried out under H 2 atmosphere to further clear the type of metal oxide species and the interaction of Cu 2 O with TiO 2 .The H 2 -TPR profiles of the catalysts are presented in Fig. 3d.The reduction profile of NS shows a main peak at 510 C which might be attributed to the reduction of unsaturated Ti (such as Ti 3 ) 49.The peaks intensity at 510 C of CNSX reduction profile gradually weaken, which may be considered as the decrease of Ti 3 content.Moreover, three main peaks at 350(CNS1), 325(CNS2) and 309 C (CNS3) are observed in the profile, assigning to the reduction of Cu 50.The lowered reduction temperature reveals that the reduction Cu becomes easier, inferring that the Cu site obtain electrons from the Ti 3 site 51.These results further confirm that the electron-deficient Ti 4 sites (LA) and electron-rich Cu 1- (LB) sites is created successfully on CNSX. To verify whether the photocatalyst could exhibit the desired results, the performances of catalysts about photoreduction CO 2 were carried out in atmospheric pressure under Xe light irradiation without any sacrificial reagents under ( 360 nm) light irradiation.As shown in Fig. 7a, NS exhibits a high CH 4 yield (37.6 mol g -1 h -1 ) with a near 100 selectivity.However, when Cu 2 O is loaded, CO as a product is appeared.Two products of CH 4 (46.3 mol g -1 h -1 , 72) and CO (19.8 mol g -1 h -1 , 28) are generated on CNS1.The increase of CH 4 activity may be assigned to the improved the separation and transfer of the photogenerated carries by Cu 2 O loaded on CNS1.With the increase of Cu 2 O mass, the selectivity and activity of CO are gradually raised, whereas the yield of CH 4 gradually decreases.CNS3 shows the highest yield of CO (162.6 mol g -1 h -1 , 98).It is obvious that introducing Cu 2 O could improve the yield of CO, which may be attributed to the variation of CO 2 coordination mode.To further explore the optimal mass of loaded Cu 2 O, the catalysts with more Cu 2 O were prepared for photoreduction CO 2 .7 wt Cu 2 O/TiO 2 (CNS4) still exhibits a high selectivity of CO (96.5).However, H 2 as a product is appeared with a selectivity of 3.5.The yield of H 2 is kept for boosting when Cu 2 O mass is further increased.The selectivity of H 2 is up to 97.2 on 12 wt Cu 2 O/TiO 2 (CNS6).Therefore, 5 wt and 7 wt Cu 2 O may be the best loaded mass for optimal yield of CO. Moreover, in the Table S1, all the catalysts exhibit negligible photocatalytic activity in the absence of either H 2 O or light irradiation, indicating that the products (CH 4 and CO) are originated from CO 2 reduction.CO 2 was replaced by isotope 13 CO 2 to further confirm that the CH 4 and CO are produced by CO 2 photoreduction.In GC-MS results (Fig. 7b), the peak at the retention time of 0.7 and 1.7 min are belonged to 13 CO (m/z 29) and 13 CH 4 (m/z 17) respectively, indicating the generated products from CO 2 reduction. As an example, the stability of CNS3 was investigated via a 36-hours tests (Fig. S5).CNS3 can keep better yield of CO.To further explore the photostability of CNS3, the used photocatalyst is characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM (Fig. S6), and XPS (Fig. S7).These analyses show that the morphology structure and chemical property of the catalyst have negligible change.So, the catalysts keep the better photocatalytic stability. To unveil why the products selectivity of CH 4 and CO can be tailored, the coordination behavior of CO 2 on the catalysts has been explored through a serious of in situ characterization analysis.DRS was used to determine the catalyst optical property.The loaded Cu 2 O increase a little visible light sorption of the catalysts (Fig. S8).Furthermore, a special experimental phenomenon is observed when the CO 2 was injected into the reaction bottle with catalyst (CNSX) suspension.As shown in Fig. 4 inset, the color of CNSX would become yellow due to injected CO 2 but the catalysts keep white under Ar, showing that the adsorbed CO 2 would make the catalysts yellowing.Fig. 4a, b, c andd shows that CNSX could expand the absorption of visible light after absorption CO 2 because a charge transfer band between CO 2 and catalyst may be generated to absorb visible light 52,53.It means that abundant CO 2 molecules would be coordinated on the catalysts via the charge transfer, which would enhance the activity of CO 2 photoreduction. XPS was adopted to uncover the interaction between CO 2 and the active sites (Cu and Ti) via detecting the chemical state of each element in the catalysts after adsorption of CO 2 .As shown in Fig. S9, the high resolution C1s spectra of the catalysts reveal that only adventitious carbon peaks at 284.8 eV.After adsorption CO 2 , two peaks with higher binding energy (286.4 and 288.4 eV) can be added into the C1s spectra (Fig. 5a), which may be assigned to C-O and C--O of the adsorbed CO 2 , respectively.It is obvious that C-O components increase in CNSX, suggesting that the coordination mode of CO 2 may possess C-O bonds.Moreover, in Fig. 5b, the O1s spectra show that intensity of the peaks at about 532.0 obviously increase, corresponding to the C--O or C-O of the adsorbed CO 2 .The high resolution Ti2p spectra (Fig. 5c) show that the signals of Ti 4 disappear in CNSX after adsorption CO 2 .Meanwhile, the binding energy of Ti shifts toward to the lower binding energy, suggesting that the electron density of Ti increase.It could be concluded that Ti sites may obtain additional electrons from CO 2 .Fig. 5d shows that the Cu binding energy in CNSX is higher than that of the catalysts after adsorption CO 2 , inferring that the electron density of Cu decreases.It indicates that the electrons of Cu sites may be transferred into CO 2 .To further investigate binding and electron transfer between active sites and CO 2 molecules, in situ EPR measurement is carried out.The CO 2 adsorption on NS were explored in our previous work.So, the EPR spectra of CNSX before and after the adsorption of CO 2 are displayed in Fig. 6a.The g and A tensors (A for Cu of 137 G and g of 2.342) appear in spectra after adsorption CO 2 , demonstrating that CO 2 would be bind on the catalyst via the formation of Cu complex 54.The peak at 1.973 disappear, revealing that the unpaired electrons were redistributed on the catalysts surface due to the adsorbed CO 2 55.The Cu clusters signals at 2.002 also become weak after adsorption CO 2 , which may be attributed to the electrons transfer from Cu to CO 2 .Therefore, it determines that CO 2 molecule would be coordinated on the catalysts via the electrons transfer from Cu 1- to CO 2 and CO 2 to Ti 4 .Therefore, the bimetal bridging CuCO 2 Ti intermediate ( 1 - 2 ) may be formed on CNSX.In situ FT-IR was adopted out to further explore the coordination mode for CO 2 .As shown in Fig. 6b, the peaks at 1227 cm -1 could be assigned to the asymmetrical stretching vibration of C--O bond in bridging TiCO 2 -Ti species 15.With increasing the mass of loaded temperature reveals that the coordination species have changed.Based on above results, it could be concluded that the coordination mode on CNSX possesses C--O and C-O bonds.Moreover, the electrons transfer takes place between in CO 2 and active sites (OTi 4 and Cu 1- C).Hence, the bimetal bridging CuCO 2 Ti mode is generated assuredly on CNSX.Moreover, the bridging TiCO 2 -Ti mode would disappear on the catalysts but the bimetal bridging CuCO 2 Ti appear gradually with increasing the mass of Cu 2 O. Therefore, the products selectivity of CO and CH 4 could be governed effectively. Based on above results and discussion, a possible mechanism is discussed to elucidate CO and CH 4 generation pathway on the catalysts and further understand how the coordination mode determines the products selectivity.As shown in Fig. 8, under dark, CO 2 molecule would be bonded on the surface of catalyst.On NS surface, CO 2 can be absorbed via the formation of TiCO 2 -Ti intermediate which facilitates CH 4 generation.However, on CNSX surface, Cu -Ti 3 interface interaction results in the formation of electron-deficient Ti 4 sites (LA) and electron-rich Cu 1- (LB) sites.So, the bimetal bridging CuCO 2 Ti species is formed via the charge transfer from O (CO 2 ) to Ti 4 and Cu 1- to C. Because of this bidirectional charge transfer, the activated CO 2 molecule may keep electric neutrality, which impedes the protonation of CO 2 and further makes the product toward to the production of CO.In addition, in this intermediate, only one C--O coordinates with the active sites, implying that the activated C--O is easier to be dissociated for generating CO.Under light, the catalysts and the charge transfer band would be excited to fleetly produce the photogenerated electrons.Then the electrons are quickly transferred to the coordinated CO 2 via the coordination bond.Finally, the generated CO and CH 4 split away off the catalyst.Meanwhile, the photogenerated holes may be consumed to produce H 2 O 2 and O 2 , which is discussed in our previous work 14. In summary, the products selectivity of CH 4 and CO from photoreduction CO 2 is successfully controlled via creating Cu 2 O clusters/TiO 2 ultrathin nanosheet as a photocatalyst, which is profited from the Cu -Ti 3 interface interaction to tailor the coordination mode of CO 2 .The Cu -Ti 3 interface interaction causes the generation of Cu 1- and Ti 4 sites and elimination of Ti 3 via the charge transfer from Ti 3 to Cu .In this case, the bimetal bridging CuCO 2 Ti species with coordination bonds (OTi and CuC) would be formed on CNSX, which determines the formation CO.Moreover, loading Cu 2 O can improve the adsorption of visible light and the separation and transfer ability for generated carriers.The CO 2 coordination greatly increases the adsorption of visible light, which benefits from the excitation of the charge transfer band.The coordination bonds could accelerate the photogenerated electron transfer to CO 2 for generating the products.As a result, NS exhibits 100 selectivity of CH 4 (37.6 mol g -1 h -1 ) but CNS3 achieves 98 selectivity of CO (162.6 mol g -1 h -1 ).This work may provide a special horizon to tailor the products selectivity from photoreduction CO 2 via the interface interaction mediated the CO 2 coordination mode.

The CO 2 photoreduction experiments were performed in a 45 mL glass bottle at ambient temperature (Fig. S1). 10 mg of catalyst was dispersed in 20 mL of pure water by sonication to get pulp suspension.This system was treated with vacuum degassing and then refilled with pure CO 2 gas (99.999) for 5 times.The photocatalytic reaction was carried out for 6 h with UV-vis-light irradiation (PLS-SXE300D, 1000 mW/cm 2 , Beijing Perfectlight Co., Ltd. 360 nm).After photoreaction, 0.4 mL of mixed gas was taken from the reactor to analyze the gas concentration of the product using a gas chromatography (GC-7890B, Agilent) equipped with a TCD, an FID detector and a chromatographic column (MolSieve 5 A).The isotopic 13 CO 2 experiment was analyzed by an Agilent GC-MS analyzer with 5977B MSD mass spectrometer. The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was adopted to determine the crystal phases of the prepared samples.As shown in Fig. 1a, the diffraction patterns of all samples show the characteristic diffraction peaks of anatase TiO 2 (JCPDS No: 65-5714) 31.The diffraction patterns of CNSX display three diffraction peaks at 36.4 , 42.3 and 61.4 can be well assigned to the (111), ( 200) and (220) crystal facets of cubic Cu 2 O (JCPDS No: 05-0667), suggesting that the samples consist of the Cu 2 O/TiO 2 (anatase) 32.In addition, a small shift to high angle of the lattice plane (101) is observed in the diffraction patterns of CNSX (Fig. 1b) compared to NS, inferring that the strong interaction between Cu 2 O and TiO 2 33.The prepared catalysts with an ultra-thin structure (3.2 nm) could be demonstrated by SEM, TEM and AFM images in Fig. 1c, d ande.The DRS spectra (Figure .S2a) depict that the Cu 2 O sample spectrum has an obvious blue shift compared with spectrum of standard Cu 2 O due to quantum scale effect, suggesting that the diameter of Cu 2 O is up to nanoscale.Furthermore, a high dispersed nano-clusters with 2 nm diameter can be obviously found in the TEM and HADDF images (Fig. 1e andf).The HRTEM image (Fig. 2a) exhibits two kinds of the lattice stripes with 0.35 and 0.24 nm, corresponding to the lattice planes (101) of anatase TiO 2 and (111) of Cu 2 O, respectively 343536.The distinct selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Fig. 2b) shows the polycrystalline anatase phase of the sample.In addition, mapping images (Fig. 2c) further reveal that the Cu element is uniformly distributed on the TiO 2 nanosheets.So, it means that the Cu 2 O clusters/TiO 2 ultrathin nanosheets (CNSX) with a thickness of 4 TiO 2 cells are successfully created 37. N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherm (Figure .S2b) reveals that the specific surface area of all the samples is about 90 m 2 /g, which may offer abundant active sites on the surface to adsorb more CO 2 molecule for improving the photocatalytic activity 38.The separation and transfer ability for photogenerated electrons-holes of the prepared samples was valued by the transient photocurrent response, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and PL (Figure . S3 a, b andc).The photo-response current of the catalysts (NS: 11.5, CNS1: 22.3, CNS2: 40.2 and CNS3: 49.3 Acm -2 ) gradually increase with adding the loading-mass of Cu 2 O, revealing that Cu 2 O could accelerate the separation and transfer ability for carries 39.The EIS and PL analysis also can give an assistance for this result 40.It may be attributed to the generated direct Z-scheme heterostructure in Fig. S12 41. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to detect the chemical composition and the chemical state of each element for unveiling whether the preconceived active sites are exposed on the prepared samples.The XPS survey (Figure .S4a) shows that Ti, O and Cu elements can be detected in CNSX, suggesting that Cu 2 O is loaded on TiO 2 nanosheets successfully.The high-resolution Ti 2p spectra are displayed in Fig. 3a.The peaks of NS spectrum at 463.6 eV, 457.1 eV and 462.6 eV, 456.9 eV are corresponded to Ti 4 2p 1/2 , Ti 4 2p 3/2 and Ti 3 2p 1/2 , Ti 3 2p 3/2 , respectively 42.However, in the spectra of CNSX, the intensity of Ti 3 characteristic peaks gradually weakens and until disappears.Particularly, the Ti 2p spectra of CNSX can be fitted by added a group of peaks with higher binding energy (CNS1: 465.4 eV, 459.8 eV, CNS2: 465.7 eV, 459.9 eV and CNS3: 465.5 eV, 456.0 eV), which may be assigned to Ti 4 2p 1/2 and Ti 4 2p 3/2 43.It means that Ti 4 sites may act as the electron-deficient Ti sites (LA).Moreover, the electron binding energy of Ti in CNSX increases compared with that of in NS, demonstrating that Ti would loss electrons.The high-resolution Cu2p (Fig. 3b) and CuLMM spectra (Figure .S4b) of the samples depict the chemical state of Cu.A group of main peaks at 932.6 and 952.4 eV are observed in the spectra of Cu 2 O, belonging to Cu /Cu 0 2p 1/2 and 2p 3/2 .A peak at 916.6 eV is showed in CuLMM spectra, identifying that the Cu chemical state is Cu 44.Moreover, a small group of peaks at 934.5 and 954.3 eV could be assigned to Cu 2 2p 1/2 and Cu 2 2p 3/2 , respectively 45.The XPS spectra of CNSX exhibit a single group of peaks at 932.0, 951.4 eV (CNS1), 931.5, 952.8 eV (CNS2) and 931.4,951.0 eV (CNS3).According to the CuLMM spectra, the chemical state of Cu in the CNSX is considered as Cu .Compared with the binding energy of Cu in NS, a large shift toward the low-binding-energy side is observed in CNSX, suggesting that the electrons density of Cu increases greatly.Therefore, the electron-rich Cu 1- as a LB site may be appeared on CNSX.These XPS results reveal that the Cu -Ti 3 interface interaction may be generated via the charge transfer from Ti to Cu, which further causes the formation of electron-deficient Ti 4 sites (LA) and electron-rich Cu 1- (LB) sites on CNSX.The O chemical state of the samples is revealed by the high-resolution O1s XPS spectra (Figure . S4c, andd).The spectra could be deconvoluted into three peaks, which is identified as lattice oxygen (O1), hydroxyl (O2) and adsorbed oxygen (O3), respectively 46.EPR was used to further reveal the active sites (Fig. 3c).NS possess some Ti 3 , which could be inferred from the peaks at g value of 2.003 and 1.997 47.The peak at g value of 2.212 belongs to the Cu 2 defects with unpaired electrons in 3d orbitals.In additional, the peak at g value of 2.002 could be considered as the metallic Cu clusters because Cu obtains electrons from Ti 3 42.The peak at g value of 1.973 may be assigned to the unpaired electrons of other species formed by the charge transfer 48.This result may provide additional evidence for the Cu -Ti 3 interface interaction. Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) was carried out under H 2 atmosphere to further clear the type of metal oxide species and the interaction of Cu 2 O with TiO 2 .The H 2 -TPR profiles of the catalysts are presented in Fig. 3d.The reduction profile of NS shows a main peak at 510 C which might be attributed to the reduction of unsaturated Ti (such as Ti 3 ) 49.The peaks intensity at 510 C of CNSX reduction profile gradually weaken, which may be considered as the decrease of Ti 3 content.Moreover, three main peaks at 350(CNS1), 325(CNS2) and 309 C (CNS3) are observed in the profile, assigning to the reduction of Cu 50.The lowered reduction temperature reveals that the reduction Cu becomes easier, inferring that the Cu site obtain electrons from the Ti 3 site 51.These results further confirm that the electron-deficient Ti 4 sites (LA) and electron-rich Cu 1- (LB) sites is created successfully on CNSX. To verify whether the photocatalyst could exhibit the desired results, the performances of catalysts about photoreduction CO 2 were carried out in atmospheric pressure under Xe light irradiation without any sacrificial reagents under ( 360 nm) light irradiation.As shown in Fig. 7a, NS exhibits a high CH 4 yield (37.6 mol g -1 h -1 ) with a near 100 selectivity.However, when Cu 2 O is loaded, CO as a product is appeared.Two products of CH 4 (46.3 mol g -1 h -1 , 72) and CO (19.8 mol g -1 h -1 , 28) are generated on CNS1.The increase of CH 4 activity may be assigned to the improved the separation and transfer of the photogenerated carries by Cu 2 O loaded on CNS1.With the increase of Cu 2 O mass, the selectivity and activity of CO are gradually raised, whereas the yield of CH 4 gradually decreases.CNS3 shows the highest yield of CO (162.6 mol g -1 h -1 , 98).It is obvious that introducing Cu 2 O could improve the yield of CO, which may be attributed to the variation of CO 2 coordination mode.To further explore the optimal mass of loaded Cu 2 O, the catalysts with more Cu 2 O were prepared for photoreduction CO 2 .7 wt Cu 2 O/TiO 2 (CNS4) still exhibits a high selectivity of CO (96.5).However, H 2 as a product is appeared with a selectivity of 3.5.The yield of H 2 is kept for boosting when Cu 2 O mass is further increased.The selectivity of H 2 is up to 97.2 on 12 wt Cu 2 O/TiO 2 (CNS6).Therefore, 5 wt and 7 wt Cu 2 O may be the best loaded mass for optimal yield of CO. Moreover, in the Table S1, all the catalysts exhibit negligible photocatalytic activity in the absence of either H 2 O or light irradiation, indicating that the products (CH 4 and CO) are originated from CO 2 reduction.CO 2 was replaced by isotope 13 CO 2 to further confirm that the CH 4 and CO are produced by CO 2 photoreduction.In GC-MS results (Fig. 7b), the peak at the retention time of 0.7 and 1.7 min are belonged to 13 CO (m/z 29) and 13 CH 4 (m/z 17) respectively, indicating the generated products from CO 2 reduction. As an example, the stability of CNS3 was investigated via a 36-hours tests (Fig. S5).CNS3 can keep better yield of CO.To further explore the photostability of CNS3, the used photocatalyst is characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM (Fig. S6), and XPS (Fig. S7).These analyses show that the morphology structure and chemical property of the catalyst have negligible change.So, the catalysts keep the better photocatalytic stability. To unveil why the products selectivity of CH 4 and CO can be tailored, the coordination behavior of CO 2 on the catalysts has been explored through a serious of in situ characterization analysis.DRS was used to determine the catalyst optical property.The loaded Cu 2 O increase a little visible light sorption of the catalysts (Fig. S8).Furthermore, a special experimental phenomenon is observed when the CO 2 was injected into the reaction bottle with catalyst (CNSX) suspension.As shown in Fig. 4 inset, the color of CNSX would become yellow due to injected CO 2 but the catalysts keep white under Ar, showing that the adsorbed CO 2 would make the catalysts yellowing.Fig. 4a, b, c andd shows that CNSX could expand the absorption of visible light after absorption CO 2 because a charge transfer band between CO 2 and catalyst may be generated to absorb visible light 52,53.It means that abundant CO 2 molecules would be coordinated on the catalysts via the charge transfer, which would enhance the activity of CO 2 photoreduction. XPS was adopted to uncover the interaction between CO 2 and the active sites (Cu and Ti) via detecting the chemical state of each element in the catalysts after adsorption of CO 2 .As shown in Fig. S9, the high resolution C1s spectra of the catalysts reveal that only adventitious carbon peaks at 284.8 eV.After adsorption CO 2 , two peaks with higher binding energy (286.4 and 288.4 eV) can be added into the C1s spectra (Fig. 5a), which may be assigned to C-O and C--O of the adsorbed CO 2 , respectively.It is obvious that C-O components increase in CNSX, suggesting that the coordination mode of CO 2 may possess C-O bonds.Moreover, in Fig. 5b, the O1s spectra show that intensity of the peaks at about 532.0 obviously increase, corresponding to the C--O or C-O of the adsorbed CO 2 .The high resolution Ti2p spectra (Fig. 5c) show that the signals of Ti 4 disappear in CNSX after adsorption CO 2 .Meanwhile, the binding energy of Ti shifts toward to the lower binding energy, suggesting that the electron density of Ti increase.It could be concluded that Ti sites may obtain additional electrons from CO 2 .Fig. 5d shows that the Cu binding energy in CNSX is higher than that of the catalysts after adsorption CO 2 , inferring that the electron density of Cu decreases.It indicates that the electrons of Cu sites may be transferred into CO 2 .To further investigate binding and electron transfer between active sites and CO 2 molecules, in situ EPR measurement is carried out.The CO 2 adsorption on NS were explored in our previous work.So, the EPR spectra of CNSX before and after the adsorption of CO 2 are displayed in Fig. 6a.The g and A tensors (A for Cu of 137 G and g of 2.342) appear in spectra after adsorption CO 2 , demonstrating that CO 2 would be bind on the catalyst via the formation of Cu complex 54.The peak at 1.973 disappear, revealing that the unpaired electrons were redistributed on the catalysts surface due to the adsorbed CO 2 55.The Cu clusters signals at 2.002 also become weak after adsorption CO 2 , which may be attributed to the electrons transfer from Cu to CO 2 .Therefore, it determines that CO 2 molecule would be coordinated on the catalysts via the electrons transfer from Cu 1- to CO 2 and CO 2 to Ti 4 .Therefore, the bimetal bridging CuCO 2 Ti intermediate ( 1 - 2 ) may be formed on CNSX.In situ FT-IR was adopted out to further explore the coordination mode for CO 2 .As shown in Fig. 6b, the peaks at 1227 cm -1 could be assigned to the asymmetrical stretching vibration of C--O bond in bridging TiCO 2 -Ti species 15.With increasing the mass of loaded temperature reveals that the coordination species have changed.Based on above results, it could be concluded that the coordination mode on CNSX possesses C--O and C-O bonds.Moreover, the electrons transfer takes place between in CO 2 and active sites (OTi 4 and Cu 1- C).Hence, the bimetal bridging CuCO 2 Ti mode is generated assuredly on CNSX.Moreover, the bridging TiCO 2 -Ti mode would disappear on the catalysts but the bimetal bridging CuCO 2 Ti appear gradually with increasing the mass of Cu 2 O. Therefore, the products selectivity of CO and CH 4 could be governed effectively. Based on above results and discussion, a possible mechanism is discussed to elucidate CO and CH 4 generation pathway on the catalysts and further understand how the coordination mode determines the products selectivity.As shown in Fig. 8, under dark, CO 2 molecule would be bonded on the surface of catalyst.On NS surface, CO 2 can be absorbed via the formation of TiCO 2 -Ti intermediate which facilitates CH 4 generation.However, on CNSX surface, Cu -Ti 3 interface interaction results in the formation of electron-deficient Ti 4 sites (LA) and electron-rich Cu 1- (LB) sites.So, the bimetal bridging CuCO 2 Ti species is formed via the charge transfer from O (CO 2 ) to Ti 4 and Cu 1- to C. Because of this bidirectional charge transfer, the activated CO 2 molecule may keep electric neutrality, which impedes the protonation of CO 2 and further makes the product toward to the production of CO.In addition, in this intermediate, only one C--O coordinates with the active sites, implying that the activated C--O is easier to be dissociated for generating CO.Under light, the catalysts and the charge transfer band would be excited to fleetly produce the photogenerated electrons.Then the electrons are quickly transferred to the coordinated CO 2 via the coordination bond.Finally, the generated CO and CH 4 split away off the catalyst.Meanwhile, the photogenerated holes may be consumed to produce H 2 O 2 and O 2 , which is discussed in our previous work 14. In summary, the products selectivity of CH 4 and CO from photoreduction CO 2 is successfully controlled via creating Cu 2 O clusters/TiO 2 ultrathin nanosheet as a photocatalyst, which is profited from the Cu -Ti 3 interface interaction to tailor the coordination mode of CO 2 .The Cu -Ti 3 interface interaction causes the generation of Cu 1- and Ti 4 sites and elimination of Ti 3 via the charge transfer from Ti 3 to Cu .In this case, the bimetal bridging CuCO 2 Ti species with coordination bonds (OTi and CuC) would be formed on CNSX, which determines the formation CO.Moreover, loading Cu 2 O can improve the adsorption of visible light and the separation and transfer ability for generated carriers.The CO 2 coordination greatly increases the adsorption of visible light, which benefits from the excitation of the charge transfer band.The coordination bonds could accelerate the photogenerated electron transfer to CO 2 for generating the products.As a result, NS exhibits 100 selectivity of CH 4 (37.6 mol g -1 h -1 ) but CNS3 achieves 98 selectivity of CO (162.6 mol g -1 h -1 ).This work may provide a special horizon to tailor the products selectivity from photoreduction CO 2 via the interface interaction mediated the CO 2 coordination mode.

DRS of the samples before and after adsorption of CO 2 . , a new peak at 2080 cm -1 gradually appears in the spectra of CNSX but the peak at 1227 cm -1 disappears.It is reported that the peak (2080 cm -1 ) may be considered as the symmetrical stretching vibration (C--O) of the CO group56.Compared the vibration peak of C--O bond at 2365 cm -1 in free CO 2 , this peak (2080 cm -1 ) shifts to lower wavenumbers, implying that one C--O of CO 2 may be not involved in coordination.So, the bimetal bridging CuCO 2 Ti intermediate may be desorption of CO 2 (CO 2 -TPD) was used to further distinguish the bridging TiCO 2 -Ti and bimetal bridging CuCO 2 Ti intermediate.Each sample only exhibits a main desorption peak at 214 (NS), 208 (CNS1), 198 (CNS2) and 178 C (CNS3) in Fig. 6c, assigning to the adsorption CO 2 species.The hapticity of bridging TiCO 2 -Ti intermediate ( 2 - 4 ) is higher than that of the bimetal bridging CuCO 2 Ti ( 1 - 2 ), suggesting that TiCO 2 -Ti is more stable than CuCO 2 Ti 57.Therefore, the decreased desorption Fig. 5.
