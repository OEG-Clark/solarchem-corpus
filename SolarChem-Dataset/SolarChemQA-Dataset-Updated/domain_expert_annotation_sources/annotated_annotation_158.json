(Carbagas, 99.9990) and bidistil-CO 2 led (0.06 lS cm1) were used in all experiments.H 2 O Samples for the microreactor were prepared by transferring an aqueous suspension onto the sapphire discs that form TiO 2 the windows of the photoreactor and by subsequent slow evaporation of the solvent.Details of this preparation method can be found in ref. 20.Using this technique, 40E400 lg TiO 2 were deposited onto the windows as dense, optically homogeneous layers of nominally 0.12E1.2lm thickness.From SEM images of a (Degussa P25) covered sapphire window TiO 2 that was fractured and imaged from the side an actual thickness for the layer of ca.600 nm is obtained.The nominal TiO 2 thickness of this sample was 200 nm, thus a void volume of 66 is calculated for the layer.SEM pictures imaging TiO 2 the layers from the top show that they are formed by densely packed microcrystals of 20E70 nm diameter.However, TiO 2 isolated large pores of ca.200 nm diameter are clearly visible.These large pores are mainly responsible for the large void fraction of the layers as calculated from their thicknesses. Photochemical experiments were performed in a microreactor described elsewhere.20Gaseous products were detected by a mass spectrometer (MS).The MS was calibrated directly by lling the reactor with known gas mixtures and subsequently measuring the concentration with the MS while the reactor was purged.The detection limit inside the reactor was 2 ppm and 5 ppm CO cannot be detected in these experi-CH 4 H 2 .ments as we use as carrier gas.This results in a large CO 2 CO(m/z 28) background signal arising from frag-CO 2 mentation.A 200 W Hg/Xe-lamp was used as the light source.IR radiation was blocked by a cooled water lter (l 10 cm).To select individual Hg emission lines, a lter wheel, holding up to six narrow width band pass lters, was placed in front of the light source.Filters used were centered at 313, 365 and 436 nm (LCP10-X-R, Laser Components GmbH) and 400 nm (FS10-50, Andover Corp.). .carried out in stopped Now mode accumulating the photoproducts for 15 min in the microreactor before analysing its contents by MS.Each measurement was preceded by an identical measurement with the light blocked for background correction.The inset in Fig. 1 shows the raw data of the rst few measurements of the experiment.The cumulative product yields shown in this inset only rise when the sample is irradiated (light sections) and stay constant during the background measurements (grey sections).This shows that products are formed only during the periods when the sample is irradiated and not in the dark.In the main graph in Fig. 1 Additional experiments were performed to demonstrate the photochemical nature of the reaction.No products could be detected without as photosensitiser.Only traces of TiO 2 photoproducts (10 as compared with the samples in Fig. 1) were observed without as reactant.In this experiment CO 2 traces of were detected too which indicates that the CO 2 observed products result from the decomposition of minute organic contaminants in the system.Lastly, the yield of the photoproducts measured at 313, 365, 400 and 436 nm corresponded well to the relative absorptivity of (P25) at TiO 2 these wavelengths. The reproducibility of the results obtained with the microreactor was checked by independently measuring two separately prepared samples.In this experiment a mean deviation of the cumulative yields in photoproducts of O10 was found after 6 h of irradiation. To study the temperature dependence of the photoreduction of the experiment was repeated at three di erent CO 2 temperatures (25, 100 and 200 C) but with (Degussa TiO 2 P25) as photosensitiser.Thus the results are not directly comparable to the ones in Fig. 1 (Degussa P25) were irradiated with IR-free light in the presence of water saturated (partial pressure 20 mbar).The CO 2 experiments were carried out in stopped Now mode by accumulating products for 15 min.The measurements are again background-corrected.As can be seen from Fig. 2 the CH 4 yield increases for higher reaction temperatures.At all three temperatures investigated the reaction shows a behaviour similar to that shown in Fig. 1.Initially the reaction is fast but suddenly slows down rather drastically.However the kink in the curve for the cumulative yield is less pronounced and appears already after 1 h of irradiation. We and depending on the concentration of H atoms and CH 3 radicals on the semiconductor surface also Based on these thoughts can be identied as C n H m C 2 H 6 .Because the time available to analyse the reactor contents in the MS is very short (O1 s), detailed m/z patterns could not be recorded.Thus this hypothesis could not be veried and the formation of even higher hydrocarbons can not be excluded at present. From previous experiments19 applying gas chromatography to detect the photoproducts we know that CO is formed as well in the reaction.TiO 2 with the formation of reduced species.The other O-containing species mentioned above generally adsorb strongly at oxide surfaces and might also escape detection.22 This interpretation is supported by the kink in the cumulative product yields apparent in Fig. 1 after ca. 4 h of irradiation time.At this time the semiconductor surface is covered to a large extent by photoadsorbed oxygen and other oxygen-containing products and intermediates.Therefore the active sites are being blocked and the di usion of intermediates on the surface is hindered.This results in a percolation threshold above which the reac-tions considered are essentially blocked and hardly any products are formed anymore.In other words, the surface TiO 2 becomes poisoned with reaction products and intermediates. Photooxidation reactions of organic compounds at TiO 2 are well known and extensively studied in the eld of waste water treatment.14They indicate another possible reason for the low yields in reduced compounds observed in our experiments.The products formed at the surface of may be TiO 2 reoxidised by valence band holes before they desorb from the surface.This loss channel can be avoided best if one succeeds in spatially separating the photoreduction and the photooxidation. To corroborate the photosynthetic nature of the reaction several control experiments were performed.No photoproducts were observed without the photosensitiser TiO 2 .Only traces of organic products were formed in the absence of These traces are attributed to the photooxidation of CO 2 .some carbon containing contaminants available in the system.This observation is supported by the detection of small quantities of the nal oxidation product of organic com-CO 2 , pounds.The photochemical action spectrum follows the absorption spectrum of which provides further evidence TiO 2 , for a photoreaction at the surface.One could, however, TiO 2 argue that the penetration depth of the light (P absorbance1) is responsible for the decreasing activity between 313 and 436 nm.Since long wavelength photons have a large penetration depth, the mobile charge carriers are created farther away from the active surface and therefore have a high probability of recombining before they are chemically quenched at the surface.Short wavelength photons create charge carriers near the surface of the sensitiser where they have a high probability of inducing a chemical reaction before they recombine.However, this argument can not be applied to our system.In the spectral range observed the penetration depth in of even the shortest wavelength TiO 2 photons is comparable to the dimension of the micro-TiO 2 crystallites used in these experiments (Degussa P25, 21 nm 23).Thus charge carriers are formed throughout the whole volume of the crystallites at all wavelengths investigated. To use a photochemical system for the storage of concentrated solar radiation its temperature dependence must be understood as high temperatures are easily obtained under such conditions.Two factors will govern the overall storage efficiency of a simple, two-level photochemical system.Using concentrated solar radiation is benecial as the chemical potential k of an excited state increases with the concentration of light.On the other hand k decreases with increasing temperature of the system due to thermal quenching of the excited state.Real systems may be controlled by additional factors, such as adsorption/desorption equilibria of reactants and products.We therefore investigated how the photochemical synthesis of from and with as photo-CH 4 CO 2 H 2 O TiO 2 sensitiser is inNuenced by the reaction temperature while keeping the photon Nux constant.As can be seen from Fig. 2, increasing the temperature from 25 to 200 C enhances the formation substantially.A thermal step must therefore be CH 4 rate limiting in this temperature range.This behaviour contrasts with pure photoreactions that exhibit a decrease in efficiency with increasing temperature, as indicated above. The general behaviour of formation as a function of CH 4 the reaction time is rather independent of temperature.After a fast start the rate decreases during the course of the reaction.The kink in the curves for the cumulative yield, however, CH 4 is much less pronounced in experiments conducted with TiO 2 (Degussa P25) instead of anatase (compare Fig. 1 and2).We tentatively attribute this to the di erence in the surface area of the two samples and the di erent frequency with which the various crystallographic faces are present in the two modications of The curves in Fig. 2 can be analysed accord-TiO 2 .ing to an Arrhenius treatment yielding an apparent activation Fig. 3 Arrhenius plot for a reaction combining a photochemical as well as adsorption/desorption steps energy.From these values information about adsorption/ desorption equilibria of the various species involved in the reaction can be extracted according to the following treatment.12 In photochemical processes at a solid surface, where adsorption and desorption play a signicant role, can be E a expressed as is the true activation energy of the reaction while and E t Q R denote the heat of adsorption of reactants and products Q P respectively.and are temperature dependent coefficients a R a P that vary between 0 and 1, depending on the relative coverage of the surface.In ref. 12 is set to zero because photo-E t chemical reactions were dened to be activationless.One might however question this choice but the following arguments still remain valid.We therefore retain the initial choice of ref. 12.At low temperatures surface coverage is high and products do not easily desorb.Reactants can thus not be resupplied and and approaches 1.In this situation a R 0 a P product desorption is rate limiting and the apparent activation energy becomes At high temperatures the surface is scarcely covered and products readily desorb In this case the adsorption of (a P 0).reactants becomes more important approaches 1) and (a R hence and therefore negative. To summarise, determines the apparent activation Q R energy if the surface is scarcely covered with reactants and Q P becomes crucial when the coverage with products is large.Fig. 3 shows a typical Arrhenius plot for such reactions.Three regions can be distinguished : At low temperatures is posi-E a tive (I) and at high temperatures negative (III) with an intermediate region, where becomes zero (II).This explains the E a unusual situation for reactions at solid surfaces that raising the temperature can result in either a higher, a lower or an unchanged reaction rate. We have found that the temperature dependence of the formation from and at can be described CH 4 CO 2 H 2 O TiO 2 by eqn.( 4).This is to our knowledge the rst time this model is applied to a photosynthetic reaction.From the temperature dependence of the cumulative yield of (see Fig. 2) a mean CH 4 value for the apparent activation energy of ca. 2 kJ mol1 was calculated at the beginning of the reaction.In accordance with the model depicted in Fig. 3 we found to depend itself on E a temperature.In the observed temperature range decreases E a by ca.1.3 kJ mol1 when the temperature is increased by 100 C.The reaction therefore ts case I in Fig. 3 implying that the desorption of products is the rate limiting step.Increasing the temperature results in a decreasing surface coverage and thus a diminished inNuence of the heat of adsorption of the products The small apparent activation Q P .energy indicates that the reaction is already running close to its maximum rate at 200 C where a further increase of the temperature will not increase the reaction rate substantially anymore.Moreover, at even higher temperatures, when E a becomes negative, a decrease of the reaction rate should be observed owing to the hindered adsorption of reactants and the negligible inNuence of the product desorption.Of course this assumption is only true if no additional reaction paths become accessible at higher temperatures. To further elucidate the inNuence of product desorption on the reaction rate we investigated whether also changes E a during the course of the reaction.Fig. 4 shows average E a values as a function of the irradiation time calculated from each measurement shown in Fig. 2.Here was assumed to E a be independent of temperature in contrast to the above treatment.This results in an unreasonably large statistical error for These standard errors are also indicated in Fig. 4. Not-E a .withstanding these large errors, the result suggests that the apparent activation energy increases during the course of the reaction.The result of a linear t is also reported but should only serve as a guideline for the eye.In accordance with the model we conclude that the inNuence of the product desorption increases as the reaction proceeds and the active sites of the photosensitiser become poisoned.The desorption is therefore rate limiting in the photosynthetic formation of from CH 4 and at a surface.These observations are in CO 2 H 2 O TiO 2 agreement with the results obtained for the temperature dependence of (vide supra).We currently think that strong-E a ly adsorbed oxygen-containing species and photoadsorbed oxygen are responsible for this behaviour as we failed to detect such species by MS.A similar interpretation was invoked to explain the declining product formation observed in many photocatalytic reactions.24h26 We have shown that the photosynthetic reduction of CO .E a dependent itself and decreases by about 1.3 kJ mol1 when the temperature increases by 100 C in the temperature range considered.As a result of the adsorption/desorption equilibria itself increases during the reaction.Since 75 of all oxygen E a is missing we suspect oxygen-containing species to hinder product formation.We conclude that the fate of oxygen is the crucial parameter controlling the activity of as a sensiti-TiO 2 ser in the reaction.At present we can not decide whether the low activities observed are caused by strongly adsorbed species blocking the active sites of or whether most of TiO 2 the products are immediately reoxidised before they can desorb from the surface.To get more information, especially with regards to the identication of intermediates, direct methods are indispensable.In situ spectroscopic measurements, feasible with the reactor used, seem especially helpful tools for this purpose. Fig. 1 shows the evolution of photoproducts at a sample TiO 2 (anatase) irradiated in the microreactor for 13 h.Two sapphire windows, each covered with 100 lg were irradiated with TiO 2 light (j 900 nm) at 100 C in the presence of water saturated (water partial pressure 20 mbar).m/z 2), and CO 2 H 2 (H 2 : m/z 15) were detected.Additionally a signal at CH 4 (CH 3 : the background-corrected cumulative yields are reported as a function of the net irradiation time corresponding to half of the real experimental time.In the subsequent gures all data are presented in this way.From Fig.1we note that the cumuthe experiment but after ca. 4 h irradiation the rate suddenly decreases markedly as seen from the kink in the curves.After ca.7.5 h the rate of formation has C n H m fallen below about 20 pmol h1, the detection limit of the experiment.However, the rate of and formation H 2 CH 4 remained almost constant even after 13 h of irradiation.

From previous experiments19 applying gas chromatography to detect the photoproducts we know that CO is formed as well in the reaction.TiO 2 with the formation of reduced species.The other O-containing species mentioned above generally adsorb strongly at oxide surfaces and might also escape detection.22 This interpretation is supported by the kink in the cumulative product yields apparent in Fig. 1 after ca. 4 h of irradiation time.At this time the semiconductor surface is covered to a large extent by photoadsorbed oxygen and other oxygen-containing products and intermediates.Therefore the active sites are being blocked and the di usion of intermediates on the surface is hindered.This results in a percolation threshold above which the reac-tions considered are essentially blocked and hardly any products are formed anymore.In other words, the surface TiO 2 becomes poisoned with reaction products and intermediates. Photooxidation reactions of organic compounds at TiO 2 are well known and extensively studied in the eld of waste water treatment.14They indicate another possible reason for the low yields in reduced compounds observed in our experiments.The products formed at the surface of may be TiO 2 reoxidised by valence band holes before they desorb from the surface.This loss channel can be avoided best if one succeeds in spatially separating the photoreduction and the photooxidation. To corroborate the photosynthetic nature of the reaction several control experiments were performed.No photoproducts were observed without the photosensitiser TiO 2 .Only traces of organic products were formed in the absence of These traces are attributed to the photooxidation of CO 2 .some carbon containing contaminants available in the system.This observation is supported by the detection of small quantities of the nal oxidation product of organic com-CO 2 , pounds.The photochemical action spectrum follows the absorption spectrum of which provides further evidence TiO 2 , for a photoreaction at the surface.One could, however, TiO 2 argue that the penetration depth of the light (P absorbance1) is responsible for the decreasing activity between 313 and 436 nm.Since long wavelength photons have a large penetration depth, the mobile charge carriers are created farther away from the active surface and therefore have a high probability of recombining before they are chemically quenched at the surface.Short wavelength photons create charge carriers near the surface of the sensitiser where they have a high probability of inducing a chemical reaction before they recombine.However, this argument can not be applied to our system.In the spectral range observed the penetration depth in of even the shortest wavelength TiO 2 photons is comparable to the dimension of the micro-TiO 2 crystallites used in these experiments (Degussa P25, 21 nm 23).Thus charge carriers are formed throughout the whole volume of the crystallites at all wavelengths investigated. To use a photochemical system for the storage of concentrated solar radiation its temperature dependence must be understood as high temperatures are easily obtained under such conditions.Two factors will govern the overall storage efficiency of a simple, two-level photochemical system.Using concentrated solar radiation is benecial as the chemical potential k of an excited state increases with the concentration of light.On the other hand k decreases with increasing temperature of the system due to thermal quenching of the excited state.Real systems may be controlled by additional factors, such as adsorption/desorption equilibria of reactants and products.We therefore investigated how the photochemical synthesis of from and with as photo-CH 4 CO 2 H 2 O TiO 2 sensitiser is inNuenced by the reaction temperature while keeping the photon Nux constant.As can be seen from Fig. 2, increasing the temperature from 25 to 200 C enhances the formation substantially.A thermal step must therefore be CH 4 rate limiting in this temperature range.This behaviour contrasts with pure photoreactions that exhibit a decrease in efficiency with increasing temperature, as indicated above. The general behaviour of formation as a function of CH 4 the reaction time is rather independent of temperature.After a fast start the rate decreases during the course of the reaction.The kink in the curves for the cumulative yield, however, CH 4 is much less pronounced in experiments conducted with TiO 2 (Degussa P25) instead of anatase (compare Fig. 1 and2).We tentatively attribute this to the di erence in the surface area of the two samples and the di erent frequency with which the various crystallographic faces are present in the two modications of The curves in Fig. 2 can be analysed accord-TiO 2 .ing to an Arrhenius treatment yielding an apparent activation Fig. 3 Arrhenius plot for a reaction combining a photochemical as well as adsorption/desorption steps energy.From these values information about adsorption/ desorption equilibria of the various species involved in the reaction can be extracted according to the following treatment.12 In photochemical processes at a solid surface, where adsorption and desorption play a signicant role, can be E a expressed as is the true activation energy of the reaction while and E t Q R denote the heat of adsorption of reactants and products Q P respectively.and are temperature dependent coefficients a R a P that vary between 0 and 1, depending on the relative coverage of the surface.In ref. 12 is set to zero because photo-E t chemical reactions were dened to be activationless.One might however question this choice but the following arguments still remain valid.We therefore retain the initial choice of ref. 12.At low temperatures surface coverage is high and products do not easily desorb.Reactants can thus not be resupplied and and approaches 1.In this situation a R 0 a P product desorption is rate limiting and the apparent activation energy becomes At high temperatures the surface is scarcely covered and products readily desorb In this case the adsorption of (a P 0).reactants becomes more important approaches 1) and (a R hence and therefore negative. To summarise, determines the apparent activation Q R energy if the surface is scarcely covered with reactants and Q P becomes crucial when the coverage with products is large.Fig. 3 shows a typical Arrhenius plot for such reactions.Three regions can be distinguished : At low temperatures is posi-E a tive (I) and at high temperatures negative (III) with an intermediate region, where becomes zero (II).This explains the E a unusual situation for reactions at solid surfaces that raising the temperature can result in either a higher, a lower or an unchanged reaction rate. We have found that the temperature dependence of the formation from and at can be described CH 4 CO 2 H 2 O TiO 2 by eqn.( 4).This is to our knowledge the rst time this model is applied to a photosynthetic reaction.From the temperature dependence of the cumulative yield of (see Fig. 2) a mean CH 4 value for the apparent activation energy of ca. 2 kJ mol1 was calculated at the beginning of the reaction.In accordance with the model depicted in Fig. 3 we found to depend itself on E a temperature.In the observed temperature range decreases E a by ca.1.3 kJ mol1 when the temperature is increased by 100 C.The reaction therefore ts case I in Fig. 3 implying that the desorption of products is the rate limiting step.Increasing the temperature results in a decreasing surface coverage and thus a diminished inNuence of the heat of adsorption of the products The small apparent activation Q P .energy indicates that the reaction is already running close to its maximum rate at 200 C where a further increase of the temperature will not increase the reaction rate substantially anymore.Moreover, at even higher temperatures, when E a becomes negative, a decrease of the reaction rate should be observed owing to the hindered adsorption of reactants and the negligible inNuence of the product desorption.Of course this assumption is only true if no additional reaction paths become accessible at higher temperatures. To further elucidate the inNuence of product desorption on the reaction rate we investigated whether also changes E a during the course of the reaction.Fig. 4 shows average E a values as a function of the irradiation time calculated from each measurement shown in Fig. 2.Here was assumed to E a be independent of temperature in contrast to the above treatment.This results in an unreasonably large statistical error for These standard errors are also indicated in Fig. 4. Not-E a .withstanding these large errors, the result suggests that the apparent activation energy increases during the course of the reaction.The result of a linear t is also reported but should only serve as a guideline for the eye.In accordance with the model we conclude that the inNuence of the product desorption increases as the reaction proceeds and the active sites of the photosensitiser become poisoned.The desorption is therefore rate limiting in the photosynthetic formation of from CH 4 and at a surface.These observations are in CO 2 H 2 O TiO 2 agreement with the results obtained for the temperature dependence of (vide supra).We currently think that strong-E a ly adsorbed oxygen-containing species and photoadsorbed oxygen are responsible for this behaviour as we failed to detect such species by MS.A similar interpretation was invoked to explain the declining product formation observed in many photocatalytic reactions.24h26"}, {"llm generation": "anatase", "source": "The kink in the curves for the cumulative yield, however, CH 4 is much less pronounced in experiments conducted with TiO 2 (Degussa P25) instead of anatase (compare Fig. 1 and2).", "context": "The reproducibility of the results obtained with the microreactor was checked by independently measuring two separately prepared samples.In this experiment a mean deviation of the cumulative yields in photoproducts of O10 was found after 6 h of irradiation.

Photooxidation reactions of organic compounds at TiO 2 are well known and extensively studied in the eld of waste water treatment.14They indicate another possible reason for the low yields in reduced compounds observed in our experiments.The products formed at the surface of may be TiO 2 reoxidised by valence band holes before they desorb from the surface.This loss channel can be avoided best if one succeeds in spatially separating the photoreduction and the photooxidation. To corroborate the photosynthetic nature of the reaction several control experiments were performed.No photoproducts were observed without the photosensitiser TiO 2 .Only traces of organic products were formed in the absence of These traces are attributed to the photooxidation of CO 2 .some carbon containing contaminants available in the system.This observation is supported by the detection of small quantities of the nal oxidation product of organic com-CO 2 , pounds.The photochemical action spectrum follows the absorption spectrum of which provides further evidence TiO 2 , for a photoreaction at the surface.One could, however, TiO 2 argue that the penetration depth of the light (P absorbance1) is responsible for the decreasing activity between 313 and 436 nm.Since long wavelength photons have a large penetration depth, the mobile charge carriers are created farther away from the active surface and therefore have a high probability of recombining before they are chemically quenched at the surface.Short wavelength photons create charge carriers near the surface of the sensitiser where they have a high probability of inducing a chemical reaction before they recombine.However, this argument can not be applied to our system.In the spectral range observed the penetration depth in of even the shortest wavelength TiO 2 photons is comparable to the dimension of the micro-TiO 2 crystallites used in these experiments (Degussa P25, 21 nm 23).Thus charge carriers are formed throughout the whole volume of the crystallites at all wavelengths investigated. To use a photochemical system for the storage of concentrated solar radiation its temperature dependence must be understood as high temperatures are easily obtained under such conditions.Two factors will govern the overall storage efficiency of a simple, two-level photochemical system.Using concentrated solar radiation is benecial as the chemical potential k of an excited state increases with the concentration of light.On the other hand k decreases with increasing temperature of the system due to thermal quenching of the excited state.Real systems may be controlled by additional factors, such as adsorption/desorption equilibria of reactants and products.We therefore investigated how the photochemical synthesis of from and with as photo-CH 4 CO 2 H 2 O TiO 2 sensitiser is inNuenced by the reaction temperature while keeping the photon Nux constant.As can be seen from Fig. 2, increasing the temperature from 25 to 200 C enhances the formation substantially.A thermal step must therefore be CH 4 rate limiting in this temperature range.This behaviour contrasts with pure photoreactions that exhibit a decrease in efficiency with increasing temperature, as indicated above. The general behaviour of formation as a function of CH 4 the reaction time is rather independent of temperature.After a fast start the rate decreases during the course of the reaction.The kink in the curves for the cumulative yield, however, CH 4 is much less pronounced in experiments conducted with TiO 2 (Degussa P25) instead of anatase (compare Fig. 1 and2).We tentatively attribute this to the di erence in the surface area of the two samples and the di erent frequency with which the various crystallographic faces are present in the two modications of The curves in Fig. 2 can be analysed accord-TiO 2 .ing to an Arrhenius treatment yielding an apparent activation Fig. 3 Arrhenius plot for a reaction combining a photochemical as well as adsorption/desorption steps energy.From these values information about adsorption/ desorption equilibria of the various species involved in the reaction can be extracted according to the following treatment.12 In photochemical processes at a solid surface, where adsorption and desorption play a signicant role, can be E a expressed as is the true activation energy of the reaction while and E t Q R denote the heat of adsorption of reactants and products Q P respectively.and are temperature dependent coefficients a R a P that vary between 0 and 1, depending on the relative coverage of the surface.In ref. 12 is set to zero because photo-E t chemical reactions were dened to be activationless.One might however question this choice but the following arguments still remain valid.We therefore retain the initial choice of ref. 12.At low temperatures surface coverage is high and products do not easily desorb.Reactants can thus not be resupplied and and approaches 1.In this situation a R 0 a P product desorption is rate limiting and the apparent activation energy becomes At high temperatures the surface is scarcely covered and products readily desorb In this case the adsorption of (a P 0).reactants becomes more important approaches 1) and (a R hence and therefore negative. To summarise, determines the apparent activation Q R energy if the surface is scarcely covered with reactants and Q P becomes crucial when the coverage with products is large.Fig. 3 shows a typical Arrhenius plot for such reactions.Three regions can be distinguished : At low temperatures is posi-E a tive (I) and at high temperatures negative (III) with an intermediate region, where becomes zero (II).This explains the E a unusual situation for reactions at solid surfaces that raising the temperature can result in either a higher, a lower or an unchanged reaction rate. We have found that the temperature dependence of the formation from and at can be described CH 4 CO 2 H 2 O TiO 2 by eqn.( 4).This is to our knowledge the rst time this model is applied to a photosynthetic reaction.From the temperature dependence of the cumulative yield of (see Fig. 2) a mean CH 4 value for the apparent activation energy of ca. 2 kJ mol1 was calculated at the beginning of the reaction.In accordance with the model depicted in Fig. 3 we found to depend itself on E a temperature.In the observed temperature range decreases E a by ca.1.3 kJ mol1 when the temperature is increased by 100 C.The reaction therefore ts case I in Fig. 3 implying that the desorption of products is the rate limiting step.Increasing the temperature results in a decreasing surface coverage and thus a diminished inNuence of the heat of adsorption of the products The small apparent activation Q P .energy indicates that the reaction is already running close to its maximum rate at 200 C where a further increase of the temperature will not increase the reaction rate substantially anymore.Moreover, at even higher temperatures, when E a becomes negative, a decrease of the reaction rate should be observed owing to the hindered adsorption of reactants and the negligible inNuence of the product desorption.Of course this assumption is only true if no additional reaction paths become accessible at higher temperatures. To further elucidate the inNuence of product desorption on the reaction rate we investigated whether also changes E a during the course of the reaction.Fig. 4 shows average E a values as a function of the irradiation time calculated from each measurement shown in Fig. 2.Here was assumed to E a be independent of temperature in contrast to the above treatment.This results in an unreasonably large statistical error for These standard errors are also indicated in Fig. 4. Not-E a .withstanding these large errors, the result suggests that the apparent activation energy increases during the course of the reaction.The result of a linear t is also reported but should only serve as a guideline for the eye.In accordance with the model we conclude that the inNuence of the product desorption increases as the reaction proceeds and the active sites of the photosensitiser become poisoned.The desorption is therefore rate limiting in the photosynthetic formation of from CH 4 and at a surface.These observations are in CO 2 H 2 O TiO 2 agreement with the results obtained for the temperature dependence of (vide supra).We currently think that strong-E a ly adsorbed oxygen-containing species and photoadsorbed oxygen are responsible for this behaviour as we failed to detect such species by MS.A similar interpretation was invoked to explain the declining product formation observed in many photocatalytic reactions.24h26"}, {"llm generation": "Monochromatic", "source": "Two sapphire windows, each covered with 100 lg were irradiated with TiO 2 light (j 900 nm) at 100 C in the presence of water saturated (water partial pressure 20 mbar).", "context": "We have shown that the photosynthetic reduction of CO .E a dependent itself and decreases by about 1.3 kJ mol1 when the temperature increases by 100 C in the temperature range considered.As a result of the adsorption/desorption equilibria itself increases during the reaction.Since 75 of all oxygen E a is missing we suspect oxygen-containing species to hinder product formation.We conclude that the fate of oxygen is the crucial parameter controlling the activity of as a sensiti-TiO 2 ser in the reaction.At present we can not decide whether the low activities observed are caused by strongly adsorbed species blocking the active sites of or whether most of TiO 2 the products are immediately reoxidised before they can desorb from the surface.To get more information, especially with regards to the identication of intermediates, direct methods are indispensable.In situ spectroscopic measurements, feasible with the reactor used, seem especially helpful tools for this purpose.

To further elucidate the inNuence of product desorption on the reaction rate we investigated whether also changes E a during the course of the reaction.Fig. 4 shows average E a values as a function of the irradiation time calculated from each measurement shown in Fig. 2.Here was assumed to E a be independent of temperature in contrast to the above treatment.This results in an unreasonably large statistical error for These standard errors are also indicated in Fig. 4. Not-E a .withstanding these large errors, the result suggests that the apparent activation energy increases during the course of the reaction.The result of a linear t is also reported but should only serve as a guideline for the eye.In accordance with the model we conclude that the inNuence of the product desorption increases as the reaction proceeds and the active sites of the photosensitiser become poisoned.The desorption is therefore rate limiting in the photosynthetic formation of from CH 4 and at a surface.These observations are in CO 2 H 2 O TiO 2 agreement with the results obtained for the temperature dependence of (vide supra).We currently think that strong-E a ly adsorbed oxygen-containing species and photoadsorbed oxygen are responsible for this behaviour as we failed to detect such species by MS.A similar interpretation was invoked to explain the declining product formation observed in many photocatalytic reactions.24h26 We have shown that the photosynthetic reduction of CO .E a dependent itself and decreases by about 1.3 kJ mol1 when the temperature increases by 100 C in the temperature range considered.As a result of the adsorption/desorption equilibria itself increases during the reaction.Since 75 of all oxygen E a is missing we suspect oxygen-containing species to hinder product formation.We conclude that the fate of oxygen is the crucial parameter controlling the activity of as a sensiti-TiO 2 ser in the reaction.At present we can not decide whether the low activities observed are caused by strongly adsorbed species blocking the active sites of or whether most of TiO 2 the products are immediately reoxidised before they can desorb from the surface.To get more information, especially with regards to the identication of intermediates, direct methods are indispensable.In situ spectroscopic measurements, feasible with the reactor used, seem especially helpful tools for this purpose.

(Carbagas, 99.9990) and bidistil-CO 2 led (0.06 lS cm1) were used in all experiments.H 2 O Samples for the microreactor were prepared by transferring an aqueous suspension onto the sapphire discs that form TiO 2 the windows of the photoreactor and by subsequent slow evaporation of the solvent.Details of this preparation method can be found in ref. 20.Using this technique, 40E400 lg TiO 2 were deposited onto the windows as dense, optically homogeneous layers of nominally 0.12E1.2lm thickness.From SEM images of a (Degussa P25) covered sapphire window TiO 2 that was fractured and imaged from the side an actual thickness for the layer of ca.600 nm is obtained.The nominal TiO 2 thickness of this sample was 200 nm, thus a void volume of 66 is calculated for the layer.SEM pictures imaging TiO 2 the layers from the top show that they are formed by densely packed microcrystals of 20E70 nm diameter.However, TiO 2 isolated large pores of ca.200 nm diameter are clearly visible.These large pores are mainly responsible for the large void fraction of the layers as calculated from their thicknesses. Photochemical experiments were performed in a microreactor described elsewhere.20Gaseous products were detected by a mass spectrometer (MS).The MS was calibrated directly by lling the reactor with known gas mixtures and subsequently measuring the concentration with the MS while the reactor was purged.The detection limit inside the reactor was 2 ppm and 5 ppm CO cannot be detected in these experi-CH 4 H 2 .ments as we use as carrier gas.This results in a large CO 2 CO(m/z 28) background signal arising from frag-CO 2 mentation.A 200 W Hg/Xe-lamp was used as the light source.IR radiation was blocked by a cooled water lter (l 10 cm).To select individual Hg emission lines, a lter wheel, holding up to six narrow width band pass lters, was placed in front of the light source.Filters used were centered at 313, 365 and 436 nm (LCP10-X-R, Laser Components GmbH) and 400 nm (FS10-50, Andover Corp.). .carried out in stopped Now mode accumulating the photoproducts for 15 min in the microreactor before analysing its contents by MS.Each measurement was preceded by an identical measurement with the light blocked for background correction.The inset in Fig. 1 shows the raw data of the rst few measurements of the experiment.The cumulative product yields shown in this inset only rise when the sample is irradiated (light sections) and stay constant during the background measurements (grey sections).This shows that products are formed only during the periods when the sample is irradiated and not in the dark.In the main graph in Fig. 1 Additional experiments were performed to demonstrate the photochemical nature of the reaction.No products could be detected without as photosensitiser.Only traces of TiO 2 photoproducts (10 as compared with the samples in Fig. 1) were observed without as reactant.In this experiment CO 2 traces of were detected too which indicates that the CO 2 observed products result from the decomposition of minute organic contaminants in the system.Lastly, the yield of the photoproducts measured at 313, 365, 400 and 436 nm corresponded well to the relative absorptivity of (P25) at TiO 2 these wavelengths. The reproducibility of the results obtained with the microreactor was checked by independently measuring two separately prepared samples.In this experiment a mean deviation of the cumulative yields in photoproducts of O10 was found after 6 h of irradiation. To study the temperature dependence of the photoreduction of the experiment was repeated at three di erent CO 2 temperatures (25, 100 and 200 C) but with (Degussa TiO 2 P25) as photosensitiser.Thus the results are not directly comparable to the ones in Fig. 1 (Degussa P25) were irradiated with IR-free light in the presence of water saturated (partial pressure 20 mbar).The CO 2 experiments were carried out in stopped Now mode by accumulating products for 15 min.The measurements are again background-corrected.As can be seen from Fig. 2 the CH 4 yield increases for higher reaction temperatures.At all three temperatures investigated the reaction shows a behaviour similar to that shown in Fig. 1.Initially the reaction is fast but suddenly slows down rather drastically.However the kink in the curve for the cumulative yield is less pronounced and appears already after 1 h of irradiation. We and depending on the concentration of H atoms and CH 3 radicals on the semiconductor surface also Based on these thoughts can be identied as C n H m C 2 H 6 .Because the time available to analyse the reactor contents in the MS is very short (O1 s), detailed m/z patterns could not be recorded.Thus this hypothesis could not be veried and the formation of even higher hydrocarbons can not be excluded at present. From previous experiments19 applying gas chromatography to detect the photoproducts we know that CO is formed as well in the reaction.TiO 2 with the formation of reduced species.The other O-containing species mentioned above generally adsorb strongly at oxide surfaces and might also escape detection.22 This interpretation is supported by the kink in the cumulative product yields apparent in Fig. 1 after ca. 4 h of irradiation time.At this time the semiconductor surface is covered to a large extent by photoadsorbed oxygen and other oxygen-containing products and intermediates.Therefore the active sites are being blocked and the di usion of intermediates on the surface is hindered.This results in a percolation threshold above which the reac-tions considered are essentially blocked and hardly any products are formed anymore.In other words, the surface TiO 2 becomes poisoned with reaction products and intermediates. Photooxidation reactions of organic compounds at TiO 2 are well known and extensively studied in the eld of waste water treatment.14They indicate another possible reason for the low yields in reduced compounds observed in our experiments.The products formed at the surface of may be TiO 2 reoxidised by valence band holes before they desorb from the surface.This loss channel can be avoided best if one succeeds in spatially separating the photoreduction and the photooxidation. To corroborate the photosynthetic nature of the reaction several control experiments were performed.No photoproducts were observed without the photosensitiser TiO 2 .Only traces of organic products were formed in the absence of These traces are attributed to the photooxidation of CO 2 .some carbon containing contaminants available in the system.This observation is supported by the detection of small quantities of the nal oxidation product of organic com-CO 2 , pounds.The photochemical action spectrum follows the absorption spectrum of which provides further evidence TiO 2 , for a photoreaction at the surface.One could, however, TiO 2 argue that the penetration depth of the light (P absorbance1) is responsible for the decreasing activity between 313 and 436 nm.Since long wavelength photons have a large penetration depth, the mobile charge carriers are created farther away from the active surface and therefore have a high probability of recombining before they are chemically quenched at the surface.Short wavelength photons create charge carriers near the surface of the sensitiser where they have a high probability of inducing a chemical reaction before they recombine.However, this argument can not be applied to our system.In the spectral range observed the penetration depth in of even the shortest wavelength TiO 2 photons is comparable to the dimension of the micro-TiO 2 crystallites used in these experiments (Degussa P25, 21 nm 23).Thus charge carriers are formed throughout the whole volume of the crystallites at all wavelengths investigated. To use a photochemical system for the storage of concentrated solar radiation its temperature dependence must be understood as high temperatures are easily obtained under such conditions.Two factors will govern the overall storage efficiency of a simple, two-level photochemical system.Using concentrated solar radiation is benecial as the chemical potential k of an excited state increases with the concentration of light.On the other hand k decreases with increasing temperature of the system due to thermal quenching of the excited state.Real systems may be controlled by additional factors, such as adsorption/desorption equilibria of reactants and products.We therefore investigated how the photochemical synthesis of from and with as photo-CH 4 CO 2 H 2 O TiO 2 sensitiser is inNuenced by the reaction temperature while keeping the photon Nux constant.As can be seen from Fig. 2, increasing the temperature from 25 to 200 C enhances the formation substantially.A thermal step must therefore be CH 4 rate limiting in this temperature range.This behaviour contrasts with pure photoreactions that exhibit a decrease in efficiency with increasing temperature, as indicated above. The general behaviour of formation as a function of CH 4 the reaction time is rather independent of temperature.After a fast start the rate decreases during the course of the reaction.The kink in the curves for the cumulative yield, however, CH 4 is much less pronounced in experiments conducted with TiO 2 (Degussa P25) instead of anatase (compare Fig. 1 and2).We tentatively attribute this to the di erence in the surface area of the two samples and the di erent frequency with which the various crystallographic faces are present in the two modications of The curves in Fig. 2 can be analysed accord-TiO 2 .ing to an Arrhenius treatment yielding an apparent activation Fig. 3 Arrhenius plot for a reaction combining a photochemical as well as adsorption/desorption steps energy.From these values information about adsorption/ desorption equilibria of the various species involved in the reaction can be extracted according to the following treatment.12 In photochemical processes at a solid surface, where adsorption and desorption play a signicant role, can be E a expressed as is the true activation energy of the reaction while and E t Q R denote the heat of adsorption of reactants and products Q P respectively.and are temperature dependent coefficients a R a P that vary between 0 and 1, depending on the relative coverage of the surface.In ref. 12 is set to zero because photo-E t chemical reactions were dened to be activationless.One might however question this choice but the following arguments still remain valid.We therefore retain the initial choice of ref. 12.At low temperatures surface coverage is high and products do not easily desorb.Reactants can thus not be resupplied and and approaches 1.In this situation a R 0 a P product desorption is rate limiting and the apparent activation energy becomes At high temperatures the surface is scarcely covered and products readily desorb In this case the adsorption of (a P 0).reactants becomes more important approaches 1) and (a R hence and therefore negative. To summarise, determines the apparent activation Q R energy if the surface is scarcely covered with reactants and Q P becomes crucial when the coverage with products is large.Fig. 3 shows a typical Arrhenius plot for such reactions.Three regions can be distinguished : At low temperatures is posi-E a tive (I) and at high temperatures negative (III) with an intermediate region, where becomes zero (II).This explains the E a unusual situation for reactions at solid surfaces that raising the temperature can result in either a higher, a lower or an unchanged reaction rate. We have found that the temperature dependence of the formation from and at can be described CH 4 CO 2 H 2 O TiO 2 by eqn.( 4).This is to our knowledge the rst time this model is applied to a photosynthetic reaction.From the temperature dependence of the cumulative yield of (see Fig. 2) a mean CH 4 value for the apparent activation energy of ca. 2 kJ mol1 was calculated at the beginning of the reaction.In accordance with the model depicted in Fig. 3 we found to depend itself on E a temperature.In the observed temperature range decreases E a by ca.1.3 kJ mol1 when the temperature is increased by 100 C.The reaction therefore ts case I in Fig. 3 implying that the desorption of products is the rate limiting step.Increasing the temperature results in a decreasing surface coverage and thus a diminished inNuence of the heat of adsorption of the products The small apparent activation Q P .energy indicates that the reaction is already running close to its maximum rate at 200 C where a further increase of the temperature will not increase the reaction rate substantially anymore.Moreover, at even higher temperatures, when E a becomes negative, a decrease of the reaction rate should be observed owing to the hindered adsorption of reactants and the negligible inNuence of the product desorption.Of course this assumption is only true if no additional reaction paths become accessible at higher temperatures. To further elucidate the inNuence of product desorption on the reaction rate we investigated whether also changes E a during the course of the reaction.Fig. 4 shows average E a values as a function of the irradiation time calculated from each measurement shown in Fig. 2.Here was assumed to E a be independent of temperature in contrast to the above treatment.This results in an unreasonably large statistical error for These standard errors are also indicated in Fig. 4. Not-E a .withstanding these large errors, the result suggests that the apparent activation energy increases during the course of the reaction.The result of a linear t is also reported but should only serve as a guideline for the eye.In accordance with the model we conclude that the inNuence of the product desorption increases as the reaction proceeds and the active sites of the photosensitiser become poisoned.The desorption is therefore rate limiting in the photosynthetic formation of from CH 4 and at a surface.These observations are in CO 2 H 2 O TiO 2 agreement with the results obtained for the temperature dependence of (vide supra).We currently think that strong-E a ly adsorbed oxygen-containing species and photoadsorbed oxygen are responsible for this behaviour as we failed to detect such species by MS.A similar interpretation was invoked to explain the declining product formation observed in many photocatalytic reactions.24h26 We have shown that the photosynthetic reduction of CO .E a dependent itself and decreases by about 1.3 kJ mol1 when the temperature increases by 100 C in the temperature range considered.As a result of the adsorption/desorption equilibria itself increases during the reaction.Since 75 of all oxygen E a is missing we suspect oxygen-containing species to hinder product formation.We conclude that the fate of oxygen is the crucial parameter controlling the activity of as a sensiti-TiO 2 ser in the reaction.At present we can not decide whether the low activities observed are caused by strongly adsorbed species blocking the active sites of or whether most of TiO 2 the products are immediately reoxidised before they can desorb from the surface.To get more information, especially with regards to the identication of intermediates, direct methods are indispensable.In situ spectroscopic measurements, feasible with the reactor used, seem especially helpful tools for this purpose.

The general behaviour of formation as a function of CH 4 the reaction time is rather independent of temperature.After a fast start the rate decreases during the course of the reaction.The kink in the curves for the cumulative yield, however, CH 4 is much less pronounced in experiments conducted with TiO 2 (Degussa P25) instead of anatase (compare Fig. 1 and2).We tentatively attribute this to the di erence in the surface area of the two samples and the di erent frequency with which the various crystallographic faces are present in the two modications of The curves in Fig. 2 can be analysed accord-TiO 2 .ing to an Arrhenius treatment yielding an apparent activation Fig. 3 Arrhenius plot for a reaction combining a photochemical as well as adsorption/desorption steps energy.From these values information about adsorption/ desorption equilibria of the various species involved in the reaction can be extracted according to the following treatment.12 In photochemical processes at a solid surface, where adsorption and desorption play a signicant role, can be E a expressed as is the true activation energy of the reaction while and E t Q R denote the heat of adsorption of reactants and products Q P respectively.and are temperature dependent coefficients a R a P that vary between 0 and 1, depending on the relative coverage of the surface.In ref. 12 is set to zero because photo-E t chemical reactions were dened to be activationless.One might however question this choice but the following arguments still remain valid.We therefore retain the initial choice of ref. 12.At low temperatures surface coverage is high and products do not easily desorb.Reactants can thus not be resupplied and and approaches 1.In this situation a R 0 a P product desorption is rate limiting and the apparent activation energy becomes At high temperatures the surface is scarcely covered and products readily desorb In this case the adsorption of (a P 0).reactants becomes more important approaches 1) and (a R hence and therefore negative. To summarise, determines the apparent activation Q R energy if the surface is scarcely covered with reactants and Q P becomes crucial when the coverage with products is large.Fig. 3 shows a typical Arrhenius plot for such reactions.Three regions can be distinguished : At low temperatures is posi-E a tive (I) and at high temperatures negative (III) with an intermediate region, where becomes zero (II).This explains the E a unusual situation for reactions at solid surfaces that raising the temperature can result in either a higher, a lower or an unchanged reaction rate. We have found that the temperature dependence of the formation from and at can be described CH 4 CO 2 H 2 O TiO 2 by eqn.( 4).This is to our knowledge the rst time this model is applied to a photosynthetic reaction.From the temperature dependence of the cumulative yield of (see Fig. 2) a mean CH 4 value for the apparent activation energy of ca. 2 kJ mol1 was calculated at the beginning of the reaction.In accordance with the model depicted in Fig. 3 we found to depend itself on E a temperature.In the observed temperature range decreases E a by ca.1.3 kJ mol1 when the temperature is increased by 100 C.The reaction therefore ts case I in Fig. 3 implying that the desorption of products is the rate limiting step.Increasing the temperature results in a decreasing surface coverage and thus a diminished inNuence of the heat of adsorption of the products The small apparent activation Q P .energy indicates that the reaction is already running close to its maximum rate at 200 C where a further increase of the temperature will not increase the reaction rate substantially anymore.Moreover, at even higher temperatures, when E a becomes negative, a decrease of the reaction rate should be observed owing to the hindered adsorption of reactants and the negligible inNuence of the product desorption.Of course this assumption is only true if no additional reaction paths become accessible at higher temperatures. To further elucidate the inNuence of product desorption on the reaction rate we investigated whether also changes E a during the course of the reaction.Fig. 4 shows average E a values as a function of the irradiation time calculated from each measurement shown in Fig. 2.Here was assumed to E a be independent of temperature in contrast to the above treatment.This results in an unreasonably large statistical error for These standard errors are also indicated in Fig. 4. Not-E a .withstanding these large errors, the result suggests that the apparent activation energy increases during the course of the reaction.The result of a linear t is also reported but should only serve as a guideline for the eye.In accordance with the model we conclude that the inNuence of the product desorption increases as the reaction proceeds and the active sites of the photosensitiser become poisoned.The desorption is therefore rate limiting in the photosynthetic formation of from CH 4 and at a surface.These observations are in CO 2 H 2 O TiO 2 agreement with the results obtained for the temperature dependence of (vide supra).We currently think that strong-E a ly adsorbed oxygen-containing species and photoadsorbed oxygen are responsible for this behaviour as we failed to detect such species by MS.A similar interpretation was invoked to explain the declining product formation observed in many photocatalytic reactions.24h26"}]}}
