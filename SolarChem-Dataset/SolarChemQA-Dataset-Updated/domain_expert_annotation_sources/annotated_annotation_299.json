TiO 2 nanosheet porous films were prepared by calcination of TAN films at 400 C for 4 h in air.Then, Pt nanoparticles were loaded by the photoreduction method in H 2 PtCl 6 ethanol solution.The solution was illuminated under UV light for 1 h.After that, the sample was washed with deionized water and dried.For a comparison, a TiO 2 film prepared by a sol-gel method was used as a reference 18; the sample was denoted by R-TiO 2 . UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were obtained on a Shimadzu U-3010 spectrometer, using BaSO 4 as a reference.X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were measured on an X'Pert Philips diffractometer (Cu K radiation; 2 range 5-90 , step size 0.08 , accelerating voltage 40 kV, and applied current 40 mA).The particle size and surface morphology of the samples were observed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) (JSM-7100F, JEOL Co., Japan) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) (JEM-2010, JEOL Co., Japan). The transient photocurrent-time (-) experiments were conducted using a conventional three-electrode system on the electrochemical analyzer (IM6ex, Germany).The photocatalyst film served as the working electrode, and a Pt meshwork and an Ag/AgCl electrode (SCE) acted as the counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively.The electrolyte was Na 2 SO 4 with a concentration of 0.5 molL -1 . The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 was conducted in a flat closed reactor with the inner capacity of 358 mL containing 20 mL 0.1 mol/L KHCO 3 solution.The prepared TiO 2 nanosheet porous film was located in the center of the reactor and then the ultrapure gaseous CO 2 and water vapor was flowed through the reactor for 2 h to achieve the adsorption-desorption equilibrium.Before illumination, the reactor was sealed.The light source was the high pressure Hg lamp with 300 W, and the intensity of the incident light was measured to be 10.4 mW/cm 2 .The photocatalytic reaction was typically performed at room temperature for 6 h.The products were measured by gas chromatography (GC).The comparison tests consisted of a reaction under light without the catalysts and a reaction in dark with the catalysts.The results indicated that there was almost no methane production in the comparison experiments."}, {"llm generation": "Pt", "source": "Firstly, it is commonly known that Pt could promote the interparticle charge migration and facilitate the photogenerated electrons transfer from conduction band of the TiO 2 to Pt particles, so as to provide adequate electrons for the reduction of carbon dioxide to methane 24.", "context": "Pt-Loaded TiO 2 Nanosheet Porous Film.The phase structure of the titania films was analyzed by the XRD technique.As shown in Figure 1(a), the TiO 2 film belongs to the typical anatase phase.In our previous work, we knew that TAN precursor belonged to the orthorhombic system 19.This indicated that the orthorhombic TAN has been transformed to anatase TiO 2 completely after being calcined at 400 C for 4 h.There still existed some characteristic peaks of metallic Ti at 40.2 , 63.1 , and 70.7 , indicating that only the surface of the Ti foil reacted with NaOH, and the interior still remained as Ti metal.When Pt nanoparticles were loaded on the surface of TiO 2 nanosheet porous films, the anatase phase did not change.And no apparent Pt diffraction signals appeared; this may be due to the ultrafine dispersion of Pt nanoparticles on TiO 2 nanosheet porous films and its low loading amount.However, the EDS results verified that Pt nanoparticles were successfully modified on the TiO 2 nanosheet porous films (as shown in Figure 1(b)); the mole ratio of Pt to TiO 2 was estimated to be ca.0.14. Figure 2 shows the surface morphology of the Ptloaded TiO 2 nanosheet porous films.As can be seen from Figure 2(a), anatase TiO 2 film consisted of many thin nanosheets, and the surface of the film looks like porous structure.Figure 2(b) showed that some Pt nanoparticles were successfully deposited on the surface of TiO 2 nanosheet porous film and were homogeneous both in size and in shape.To further observe the morphology of TiO 2 film, some powders were peeled off from the substrate, and their TEM images are shown in Figures 2(c) and 2(d); we can clearly see that Pt nanoparticles are very uniform, and their particle sizes are only 3-4 nm.On one hand, the porous nanosheet structure of this kind of TiO 2 film occupied larger BET surface area than the common TiO 2 film obtained by the sol-gel method, so it can increase the adsorption amount of the reactive species and then accelerate the photocatalytic reaction rate.On the other hand, more irradiated light can be utilized for the porous TiO 2 film because of the multiple scattering and reflection of the incident light in the channels of the porous film 17,20,21, so the utilization efficiency Advances in Condensed Matter Physics of the incident light was increased and thereby did favor for improving the photocatalytic activity. The optical absorption of the nanosheet porous films was shown in Figure 3.The absorption band edge of TiO 2 porous film was 380 nm.In our previous work 13,22, we found that the onset absorption of the titanate acid was about 350-360 nm.So from the change of the absorption band, we can conclude that the titanate acid had transformed to anatase TiO 2 successfully by the calcination of 400 C. While Pt nanoparticles were loaded on the surface of the TiO 2 porous film, a broad peak at around 350-550 nm was observed, which should be due to the plasma resonance absorption of the Pt nanoparticles 23.Moreover, the absorbance intensity of the film in the UV light region reduced, which should be because the loaded Pt nanoparticles shield some absorption of TiO 2 nanosheets. Porous Film.The photoreduction of CO 2 to methane was tested as a probe reaction to evaluate the photocatalytic activity of the catalyst films.As shown in Figure 4(a), the production rate of CH 4 on Pt-loaded TiO 2 nanosheet porous film reached 20.51 ppm/hcm 2 .To confirm the photocatalytic reduction process of CO 2 to CH 4 , the related reference experiments were carried out.When the system was kept in dark, there was no CH 4 produced, indicating that the photoexcited process of Pt-loaded TiO 2 was essential in the photoreduction of CO 2 .When the experiment was carried out in the absence of H 2 O, almost no CH 4 was detected.That implying that water is also one of the key roles for CO 2 photoreduction.When a blank Ti foil with the same area of Pt-loaded TiO 2 film was put into the system, the production rate of CH 4 was only 1.01 ppm/hcm 2 .This slow production rate of CH 4 should be due to the thin oxide layer on Ti foil surface. In addition, some comparative experiments about Ptloaded TiO 2 , TiO 2 porous film, and ordinary R-TiO 2 obtained by the sol-gel method proceeded.As can be seen, under the same experiment conditions, the production rate of CH 4 on Pt-loaded TiO 2 , TiO 2 , and R-TiO 2 was 20.51, 3.71, and 1.45 ppm/hcm 2 , respectively.Obviously, the photocatalytic activity of the Pt-TiO 2 nanosheet porous film was much higher than that of TiO 2 and R-TiO 2 film; the possible reasons were listed as follows.Firstly, it is commonly known that Pt could promote the interparticle charge migration and facilitate the photogenerated electrons transfer from conduction band of the TiO 2 to Pt particles, so as to provide adequate electrons for the reduction of carbon dioxide to methane 24.The charge carrier separation ability of Pt nanoparticles was verified by the transient photocurrent-time curve.As shown in Figure 4(b), the photocurrent density of TiO 2 and Pt-TiO 2 nanosheet film was 0.006 and 0.017 mAcm -2 , respectively.The photocurrent density of Pt-TiO 2 was apparently larger than that of TiO 2 , indicating that its separation efficiency of the photogenerated charge carriers was higher.Secondly, the large BET surface area and strong adsorption ability of the TiO 2 nanosheet porous structure can provide more adsorption sites for CO 2 molecules, so the localized concentration of CO 2 on the surface of TiO 2 porous film would be higher, which would accelerate the photoreduction reaction of CO 2 to methane.Thirdly, the porous and incompact structure of the TiO 2 nanosheet porous film would facilitate the use of more irradiated light, because more light can be scattered and reflected in the channels and pores of TiO 2 film 25. Methane on Pt-Loaded TiO 2 Nanosheet Porous Film.The photoreduction mechanism of CO 2 to methane on Pt-loaded TiO 2 nanosheet porous film was proposed in Figure 5.Most researchers agree that this process is based on proton-assisted multielectron transfer instead of single electron transfer, as the electrochemical potential of -2.14 V versus SCE for a single electron process is highly unfavorable 26.When Ptloaded TiO 2 nanosheet porous film was illuminated by UV light, photon-generated electrons (e -) and holes (h ) are created on the surface of the TiO 2 nanosheets.The excited holes reacted with adsorbed water molecules on the catalyst surface to produce hydroxyl radicals ( OH) and hydrogen ions (H ) and further oxidized by OH radicals to produce O 2 and H 27.And H would interact with the excited electrons to form H radicals.At the same time, the photogenerated electrons on the conduction band of TiO 2 can be easily trapped by Pt nanoparticles because of the lower Fermi energy level of the noble metal 28, and then they would transfer rapidly to the absorbed CO 2 for photoreduction reaction.CO 2 molecules would interact with the excited electrons to form to"}, {"llm generation": "Pt nanoparticles", "source": "In order to further improve the photoactivity, Pt nanoparticles with the particle size of 3-4 nm were loaded on the TiO 2 porous films uniformly.", "context": "Anatase TiO 2 nanosheet porous films obtained by calcination of the orthorhombic titanic acid films exhibited better performance for the photoreduction of CO 2 to methane.In order to further improve the photoactivity, Pt nanoparticles with the particle size of 3-4 nm were loaded on the TiO 2 porous films uniformly.The EDS results confirmed the mole ratio of Pt to TiO 2 was ca.0.14.The conversion yield of CO 2 to methane on Pt/TiO 2 film reached 20.51 ppm/hcm 2 .The transient photocurrent-time curves showed that the Pt/TiO 2 nanosheet porous film exhibited higher photocurrent, so the higher separation efficiency of the photogenerated charge carriers should be the main reason for the high photoreduction activity of CO 2 .
