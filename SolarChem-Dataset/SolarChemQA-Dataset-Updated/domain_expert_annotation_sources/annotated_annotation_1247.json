The water-coupled photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance was examined by a typical gas-solid interfacial reaction system under anaerobic conditions, similar to our previous studies 30.The light source is a 300 W Xe arc lamp (PLS-SXE300, Perfectlight, China) without (full spectrum, 320-780 nm), or with different specific filters, including, an UV cutoff filter (visible light, 420-780 nm), an AM 1.5 G filter together with a total reflector (AM 1.5 G, 200-1100 nm), or with diverse band-pass filters to obtain different monochromatic lights (350, 380, 400, 420, 435, 475, 500 nm).The gas products were analyzed using an integrated gas chromatograph (GC-7890B, Agilent) equipped with two flame-ionized detectors (FIDs) and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). 13C isotope tracer experiment was conducted to verify the carbon source of the reduction products under identical operation conditions.To disclose the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction mechanism on CCN-W surface, the CO 2 adsorption and photocatalytic evolution processes were monitored using the in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), similar to our previous studies 30.More details were elaborated in Text S2 in the Supporting information."}, {"llm generation": "CCN-W photocatalyst", "source": "To disclose the possible CO 2 conversion process during photocatalytic reactions on the CCN-W photocatalyst, the in situ DRIFTS spectra (Fig. 8 , 1500, 1610 and 1642 cm -1 ), formate species (HCOO -, 1370, 1514 and 1578 cm -1 ), and methoxy groups (-OCH 3 , 1445 and 1465 cm -1 ), are detected in the present study 50,52.", "context": "The microstructural characteristics of CCN-W nanorods are illustrated in Scheme 1, in comparison with CCN nanorods and BCN.BCN (Scheme 1, left) is characteristic of high density of terminal amino groups and weak interlayer interaction (enlarged interlayer distance) 32.In contrast, CCN (Scheme 1, middle) has reduced density of terminal amino groups and reduced interlayer distance (strengthened interlayer interactions) 7.Moreover, as clearly demonstrated previously, K -doping and terminal cyano groups are normally introduced into CCN during molten-salt treatment processes 13.The K -doping often present in three positions (Scheme 1): intercalated into the CCN interlayer; doped in the cavity confined by adjacent heptazine units or acting as charge compensator for the terminal cyano/amino groups.K -doping is important in tuning the charge transfer dynamics of CCN.The K intercalation induce a unique built-in electric field (BIEF), benefiting the interlayer electron transfer 33.Meanwhile, the cave K doping introduce new delivery paths for increasing electron delocalization, facilitating the intralayer transfer of photoelectrons between the adjacent heptazine rings 13.CCN-W are prepared by simply treating as-prepared K -doped CCN in the presence of W(CO) 6 under solvothermal conditions.As will be further demonstrated later, during the solvothermal treatment process, a portion of tungsten ions (W 6 ) will replace K in the cavity through ion exchange, forming W-N 6 bonding by six-fold coordinating with the surrounding N atoms from the adjacent heptazine units (Scheme 1, right).Meanwhile, a part of incorporated tungsten, existing in the form of tungstate ions (e.g.WO 4 ), enters into the g-C 3 N 4 interlayer to compensate with intercalated K ions.In addition, because of solvothermal-assisted side by side edge re-polymerization of CCN-W nanorods, the density of edge cyano groups are reduced to some extent, and accordingly, the amounts of compensating K is also reduced.The illustrated microstructural features of CCN-W are further demonstrated below by combining the microscopical and spectrometric characterizations (Figs.123). The morphology is firstly investigated using SEM images (Fig. 1a,b).As shown in Fig. 1, W 6 -doping hardly alter the basic morphology, both CCN and CCN-W are appeared as regular nanorods.The average length of nanorods is around 350 nm and the average diameter is about 70 nm.The microstructures of CCN-W are further investigated by the TEM (Fig. 1c) and HRTEM (Fig. 1d) images.The nanorod-like morphology is well preserved in CCN-W upon solvothermal-assisted W 6 -doping treatment.(Fig. 1c).Owing to the high crystallinity, the resolved lattice fringes with spacing of 0.98 nm are recorded for CCN-W, which is corresponding to the interlayer distance along c axis 7.The elemental compositions and distribution within CCN-W nanorods are further demonstrated by the EDS elemental mappings of C, N, K, W and O (Fig. 1f-j), performing on the corresponding HAADF-STEM image (Fig. 1e).Generally, C, N, K, W and O elements are uniformly distributed in the CCN-W sample, indicating that W-dopant is successfully incorporated, in addition to K and O. The XRD patterns are used to identify the phase structures of the prepared samples.As shown in Fig. 2a, two diffraction peaks at 13.1 and 27.4 are recorded, matching the typical (100) and (002) crystal planes of intrinsic BCN.The peak at 13.1 is corresponded to the inplane packing of 1D polymeric heptazine chains and the peak at 27.4 is assigned to the interlayer stacking of 2D -conjugated plane 34.In contrast, for CCN, these two peaks are located at 8.0 for (100) and 28.2 for (002), respectively.A significant shift in diffraction peaks suggests Scheme 1. Schematic diagram of the structural characteristics for CCN-W nanorods, in comparison with BCN nanosheets and CCN nanorods.the obvious changes in the local microstructures of CCN.The (100) peak is negatively shifted to a much lower angle, corresponding to enlarged distance within in-plane repeating motifs, which is probably originated from cave K doping and unfolded in-plane network associated with the removal of terminal amino groups, and sufficient in-plane covalent condensation of adjacent heptazine rings 7.In contrast, the (002) peak is otherwise positively shifted from 27.4 to 28.2 , corresponding to a decreased interlayer distance and stronger interlayer interactions 35.CCN-W shares similar two diffraction peaks as that of CCN.No other resolvable XRD peaks, especially those related to W 6 -involving species, are recorded, implying that incorporated W 6 is dominantly doped in the g-C 3 N 4 framework, but no crystalline impurities like WO 3-x , tungsten carbide, or tungsten nitride are introduced into the as-prepared CCN-W sample 36.In comparison, slight variations in diffraction peaks indeed occur for CCN-W relative to CCN.After W 6 -doping and the replacement of K by much larger W 6 , the intensity of (100) peak for CCN-W decrease to some extent, implying the increased defect density of N vacancies (N v ) and the decreased local order/periodicity of in-plane packing of heptazine units 37.Besides, after W 6 -doping and the intercalation of WO 4 2-into the interlayer, the (002) peak for CCN-W is slightly shifted negatively to a lower angle (27.9 ), relative to that for CCN.Accordingly, the calculated interlayer spacing along c axis is expanded from 0.316 nm (CCN) to 0.320 nm (CCN-W), after tungstate ions (WO 4 ) inserting into the g-C 3 N 4 interlayer.The phase structures of CCN-W-X (X 1, 2, 3) are shown in Fig. S1a. The compositional and structural changes of BCN, CCN and CCN-W are further identified by FTIR spectroscopy (Fig. 2b).All those sample exhibited similar FTIR spectra, meaning that they shared the same basic chemical structures.A broad peak in the region of 3500-2900 cm -1 is attributed to the uncondensed terminal amino group or surface hydroxyl groups.Compared with BCN, this peak is obviously weakened for CCN, indicating lesser terminal amino groups, which is attributed to the removal of terminal amino groups and full condensation of adjacent heptazine units in CCN.After solvothermal-assisted W 6 -doping, a slight enhancement of this peak for CCN-W versus CCN is possibly related to more surface hydroxyl groups on CCN-W.The bands ranging from 1700 to 1200 cm -1 are corresponding to the stretching vibrations of the conjugated CN heterocycles.The typical peak at 810 cm -1 is ascribed to the breathing vibration mode of heptazine units.2 Relatively, these bands become weaker in CCN-W versus CCN, owing to the electronic interaction between the doped W 6 ions at the cavity sites and the surrounding N atoms from adjacent heptazine units 36.In sharp contrast to BCN, a new peak at 2150 cm -1 is emerged for CCN, which is ascribed to the edge cyano groups 38.Those cyano groups are formed by breaking of the 1D polymeric heptazine chains and the opening of the heptazine ring, during molten-salt processes.Those cyano groups are generally stabilized by K , involving charge compensation.Accordingly, an accompanying peak, related to terminal cyano groups bound K (that is, K -NC 2 group) 7, is appeared at 1000 cm -1 .Notably, relative to CCN, both 2150 cm -1 peak and 1000 cm -1 peak for CCN-W become much weaker, corresponding to the loss of terminal cyano groups together with compensated K in CCN-W.The solvothermal-assisted W 6 -doping processes promote the condensation of terminal cyano groups and closure of the heptazine ring, 39 which is further supported by the following XPS result.The samples of CCN-W-X (X 1, 2, 3) exhibit similar FTIR spectra (Fig. S1b). EPR spectra (Fig. 2c) is used to investigate the defect states and charge mobility of the samples 40.All the three samples display a similar EPR peak (g 2.001), which is related to the unpaired electrons of the sp 2 -carbon in the -conjugated plane 18.The intensity of this EPR peak is sensitive to the detect density of N v or the degree of -electron delocalization.Owing to higher crystallinity and low defect density of CCN, the corresponding EPR peak of CCN is lower than BCN 7.A low defect density in CCN would reduce exciton recombination possibility and accelerate the exciton dissociation dynamics.Upon W 6 -doping, the EPR peak intensity for CCN-W is much stronger than that for CCN.It indicates that the W 6 -doping would introduce additional N v defects and W-N 6 associated the electron localization in the -conjugated plane 41. In addition, the surface chemical states of CCN and CCN-W are further identified by XPS spectra.The C 1 s spectrum (Fig. 3b) of CCN contains three components located at 284.8 eV (adventitious carbon), 286.8 eV (terminal cyano groups (-C ---N) or amino groups (C-NH x )) and 288.3 eV (sp 2 -hybridized carbon in heptazine rings (N-C--N)) 16.A positive shift to higher binding energies occurs at N-C--N peak for CCN-W (288.4 eV) relative to CCN (288.3 eV), which indicates that W 6 -doping into the cavity confined by heptazine rings decreases the electron density of N-C--N, suggesting strong electronic interactions between doped W 6 and heptazine ring 23.Meanwhile, due to solvothermal-promoted condensation of terminal cyano groups during W 6 -doping, the corresponding -C ---N peak for CCN-W weakens in intensity and shifts negatively in peak position (from 286.8 to 286.3 eV) 42.The N 1 s spectrum (Fig. 3c) of CCN can be fitted into four peaks positioned at 403.9 eV ( excitation), 401.3 eV (terminal amino groups (-NH x ) or terminal cyano groups (-C ---N)), 400.4 eV (tertiary nitrogen (N-(C) 3 )), and 398.7 eV (nitrogen in heptazine rings (C-N--C)) 43.Upon cave W 6 -doping, because of strong electron interaction between doped W 6 and heptazine ring, a positive shift to higher binding energies occur accordingly at C-N--C peak for CCN-W (398.8 eV), relative to that of CCN (398.7 eV).The lower electron density of C and N atoms in CCN-W is caused by W 6 -doping and forming W-N 6 bonding, in which electrons tend to transfer from N moieties in heptazine ring to empty orbitals of higher valence W 6 via Lewis acid-base interaction 37.It has been demonstrated that the six-fold cavity confined by heptazine rings in g-C 3 N 4 is the energetically most favorable site for anchoring W-atom and forming W-N 6 bonding 29.The resulting W-N 6 sites would be active centers for both electron storage and electron-dominated catalytic reduction reactions.Note that, the binding energy of N for each component in CCN-W is somewhat higher than that in CCN, suggesting a lower electron density, corresponding to a weaker Lewis basicity and moderate adsorption affinity to CO 2 .Besides, the C/N atomic ratio in CCN-W is higher than that in CCN (Table S1), which might be caused by the increase in defect density of N v 43.Meanwhile, the intensity of N-(C) 3 peak is enhanced for CCN-W, confirming the loss The two branches of O 1 s spectrum (Fig. 3e) for CCN are related to the surface hydroxyls (-OH) and surface adsorbed O 2 44,45.As for CCN-W, in addition to these two components, a new peak is emerged at binding energy of 530.8 eV, attributing to the W-O-W in tungstate ions (WO 4 2- ) 46.The W 4f spectra (Fig. 3d) for CCN-W could be divided into two pairs.The first pair of peaks at 37.4 and 35.3 eV belong to the W 6 , and another pair of peaks at 36.0 and 33.6 eV are attributed to the W 5 that are derived from the partial W 6 reduction as a result of W-N 6 bonding and electron transfer 23.Moreover, the binding energy of corresponding W 6 and W 5 peaks in CCN-W are lower than in WO 3-x , which is due to the bonding of W 6 and W 5 to the N atoms with a lower electronegativity than the O atoms 47.It is clearly that W 6 -dopant have been successfully incorporated into the g-C 3 N 4 framework of CCN-W, in both the cavity sites and the interlayer space.The reversible change in chemical states of W dopant (W 6 /W 5 cycle) would be important for the capture and storage of photoelectrons during photocatalytic reactions.The K 2p spectra (Fig. 3f) confirm the K incorporation in both CCN and CCN-W.The K -doping amount decreases from 3.18 in CCN to 1.37 in CCN-W (Table S1).Several reasons may account for the decrease in K -doping level in CCN-W.First, the ion exchange between W 6 and K in the cavity site will lead to a reduce in K -doping level.Second, owing to solvothermal-promoted condensation of terminal cyano groups during W 6 -doping, the amount of dangling -C ---N or C-NH x is reduced, and the compensating K ions is thus decreased, 18 being consistent with FTIR spectra. The specific surface area and pore features of the samples are determined by N 2 sorption (Fig. 4a).The N 2 sorption isotherms for CCN and CCN-W are comparable, which show a typical type-IV isotherms with H3-type hysteresis loops 34, corresponding to the mesoporous structures with wide pore size distribution (inset in Fig. 4a).The determined BET surface area (S BET ) of CCN and CCN-W are 76.5 and 57.1 m 2 g -1 , respectively, both are much higher than that of BCN (11.7 m 2 g -1 ).Higher S BET generally suggests the exposure of more active sites for reactant adsorption and activation 48,49.Because of the interfacial side by-side edge condensation of terminal amino/cyano groups and the attachments of adjacent CCN-W nanorods during solvothermal treatments, the S BET and pore volume of CCN-W are slightly decreased, relative to CCN (Table S2). CO 2 adsorption as the first step of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction is very important.According to the CO 2 adsorption curves in Fig. 4b, in the relative pressure (P/P 0 ) range of 0.1 -1, the CO 2 adsorption capacity is almost linearly related to P/P 0 for all the samples.This character suggests that CO 2 molecules are dominantly adsorbed on the samples by physical interaction, and the CO 2 adsorption capacity is mainly affected by S BET .Moreover, in the P/P 0 range of 0-0.1, the CO 2 uptakes are exponentially increased for samples CCN and CCN-W.This phenomenon indicates the existence of chemical adsorption between the two samples and CO 2 , which could be further demonstrated by CO 2 -TPD analysis (Fig. 4c).CO 2 -TPD analysis is used to disclose the chemisorption characteristics and basic sites within the samples .As shown in Fig. 4c, the weak CO 2 desorption peak for BCN is positioned at 76 C, which is attributed to the desorption of CO 2 adsorbed at the terminal amino groups (C-NH x ) on the surface.Relatively, CCN exhibits much stronger CO 2 adsorption capacity and intensity, presenting two intensive CO 2 desorption peak at much higher temperature.The two desorption peaks located at 159 and 450 C could be related to two different CO 2 adsorption sites, that are associated with the K -doping in CCN.It is reported that the alkaline metal doped in g-C 3 N 4 is easy to lose both the outermost electrons and part of the sub-outer electrons, and most of which would transfer to the surrounding N atoms, thus causing the charge redistribution of the surrounding N atoms 24.Since the conjugated system of the heptazine unit promotes electron delocalization, the basicity promoted by K ions doped in cavity confined by heptazine ring is weaker.In contrast, the K ions compensating with terminal cyano groups could promote the adjacent N atom exhibiting stronger alkalinity.In this regard, it is speculated that the CO 2 desorption peak at 159 C corresponds to the cave K -doping and K-N bonding confined by the heptazine ring, while the CO 2 desorption peak at 450 C corresponds to the K -compensated terminal cyano/amino groups 15.By comparison, both CO 2 adsorption capacity and intensity for CCN-W are weakened to some extent.The two CO 2 desorption peaks for CCN-W are centered at about 119 and 408 C. As demonstrated earlier by FTIR and XPS results, after solvothermal-assisted W 6 -doping, the portion of left K is significantly reduced together with the loss of terminal cyano groups.Meanwhile, the basicity of K bounded by terminal cyano groups would be compromised by the charge compensation effects of incorporated WO 4 2-.Moreover, the basicity of K-N bonding could be weakened by substituted W-N 6 bonding in cavity sites.In fact, the above XPS results also indicate a lower electron density and weaker Lewis basicity of N-moieties in CCN-W because of W-N 6 bonding, which would offer moderate adsorption affinity to CO 2 .In summary, both the CO 2 adsorption capacity and intensity follows the following order: CCN CCN-W BCN.A proper adsorption capacity and strength is usually beneficial for catalytic reactions, facilitating reactant activation and easing product desorption. CO is an important intermediate towards multi-electron reduction products during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, and the CO adsorption capacity and intensity largely determine the selectivity to hydrocarbons.According to the CO-TPD results (Fig. 4d), BCN has almost no CO adsorption capacity, favoring the preferential production of CO as major reduction product over BCN.In contrast, considerable CO adsorption is taken place over both CCN and CCN-W.Interestingly, the CO desorption curve for each of them is very comparable to the corresponding CO 2 desorption curve (Fig. 4c), suggesting CO and CO 2 share the same adsorption sites.In this regard, during CO 2 reduction, the in-situ produced CO intermediate can be stabilized, waiting to further hydrogenation to hydrocarbons.Moreover, CO and CO 2 adsorption capacity and intensity follows the same order: CCN CCN-W BCN.Considering that CO could be further converted to methane, ethylene and other hydrocarbon products, and moderate CO adsorption capacity and intensity is essential, it is expected that CCN-W is most suitable for selective photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to hydrocarbons. Relative to BCN, CCN exhibit an evident enhancement in light absorption intensity in both UV and visible light regions and a slight redshift in absorption edge (Fig. 5a), which could be attributed to the cooperative effects of stronger interlayer packing, extended covalent bonding in -conjugated plane, and the K -doping in CCN 11,35. Notably, after introducing W 6 -doping and associated localized impurity levels in the band gap, the absorption capacity in the visible light region is further enhanced for CCN-W, but the UV absorption is just slightly weakened because of enlarged interlayer distance after W 6 -doping (Fig. 2).The light absorption difference of CCN-W-X (X 1, 2, 3) could further demonstrate this inference (Fig. S2). The band structures were roughly estimated by combined optical and electrochemical analyses.First, the band gap energy (E g ) can be estimated from the corresponding Tauc plots (Fig. 5b) derived from the above UV-vis DRS spectra (Fig. 5a).The estimated E g of BCN, CCN and CCN-W are 2.60, 2.53 and 2.39 eV, respectively.The Mott-Schottky plots (Fig. 5c) can be used to clarify the nature/type of the semiconductor and to estimate the flat band potentials (E fb ).The Mott-Schottky plots of all samples exhibit positive slopes, which is a typical characteristic of n-type semiconductors 2,50.The E fb of samples BCN, CCN and CCN-W are estimated to be -1.53,-1.33 and -1.02 V versus the saturated Ag/AgCl (pH 6.7) reference electrode, respectively.It is widely accepted that the conduction band (CB) potential for n-type semiconductors is approximately more negative by 0.2 V as compared to that E fb 34.Meanwhile, the obtained potentials versus Ag/AgCl can be converted to the Normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) scale according to equations E Ag/AgCl E RHE -0.059 pH -0.197 and E NHE E RHE -0.059 pH 51.Thus, the CB potentials of samples BCN, CCN and CCN-W are calculated to be -1.55,-1.35 and -1.04 V vs. NHE (pH 7) respectively.In combination with the value of E g , the valence band (VB) potentials of samples BCN, CCN and CCN-W are calculated to be 1.05, 1.18 and 1.35 V vs. NHE, respectively.The band structures for samples BCN, CCN and CCN-W are illustrated in Fig. 5d.The doping of M ions (M K or W 6 ) in the cavity and forming M-N bonding will cause the charge redistribution of N atoms, affecting both CB and VB energy levels of CCN-W, because the N 2p orbitals of N atoms contribute to both the VB and CB 24.Evidently, CB potentials of BCN, CCN and CCN-W follow the following order: BCN CCN CCN-W.Higher CB potential suggest stronger electron reduction ability.Even though, the CB potentials of CCN-W is far higher than the redox potential of diverse CO 2 reduction reactions (Fig. 5d).In contrast, the VB potentials of BCN, CCN and CCN-W follow the following order: BCN CCN CCN-W.Both CB and VB positions of CCN and CCN-W have been downshift compared to BCN, which are still thermodynamically feasible for the CO 2 reduction and the H 2 O oxidation. The steady state PL spectra (Fig. 6a) and the time-resolved PL spectra (Fig. 6b) are recorded to untangle the charge dynamic process.All the three sample show a typical steady-state PL emission peak at about 460 nm, which is close to the value of absorption edge (Fig. 5a).This PL peak can be mainly related to band-to-band recombination of photoelectrons and holes 32.Obviously, the PL peak is substantially suppressed in CCN and CCN-W, relative to BCN.BCN possesses abundant terminal amino groups bonded by weak hydrogen bond within the -conjugated plane, so the intralayer charge transport is greatly blocked by potential barrier of 7.9 eV 32.Meanwhile, and interlayer distance of BCN is relatively larger because of weak van der Waals interlayer interaction, and the interlayer charge transfer is ever slower by even larger potential barrier of 33.2 eV 32.Accordingly, the charge recombination possibility is very high in BCN, giving rise to strong PL signal.In contrast, in CCN, the terminal amino groups are mostly removed, more covalent bonds are formed between adjacent heptazine units instead of hydrogen bonds.Moreover, after removing terminal amino groups, typical stacked sheet-like configuration extending along the 2D -conjugated plane for BCN is evolved into rod-like morphology extending along c axis (perpendicular to 2D -conjugated plane) for CCN (Fig. 1), the lateral dimension is greatly decreased and thus the diffusion lengths of photoelectrons from the interior to the lateral edges is shortened.Moreover, the interlayer interaction is strengthened by interlayer K -doping, resulting in reduced interlayer distance.All those aspects lead to faster charge transports and less charge recombination in CCN, yielding weak PL signal.After solvothermal-assisted W 6 -doping, while the aforementioned intralayer and interlayer structural merits of CCN are mostly remained, terminal cyano groups are largely removed, and additional W-N 6 centers are introduced to further promote the trapping and storage of photoelectrons, thus further reducing the charge recombination and weakening the PL signal in CCN-W.To gain a deeper insight into the charge transfer dynamics, the time-resolved PL decay spectra (Fig. 6b) are detected, which can be well fitted by triexponential functions (Text S1.4).The resulting time constants and relative amplitudes are listed in Table S3.The short lifetime ( 1 ) corresponds to radiative exciton recombination, while the long lifetimes ( 2 and 3 ) correspond to non-radiative recombination and energy-transfer process.Normally, faster exciton dissociation corresponds to lower exciton recombination and shorter exciton lifetime.BCN possesses the longest average exciton lifetime ( ave., 6.06 ns), suggesting the exciton dissociation is difficult in BCN, because of high charge localization within heptazine units connected by weak intralayer and interlayer intermolecular forces in BCN.In contrast, charge delocalization in CCN is greatly promoted by stronger intralayer and interlayer interactions, shorter the lateral inside-out charge transport distance, and abundant edge cyano groups and K -doping 7,18.As a result, the exciton dissociation in CCN is greatly promoted, and the corresponding ave. is reduced to 3.48 ns.Upon solvothermal-assisted W 6 -doping, the ave.for CCN-W (4.71) is slightly prolonged relative to CCN, which might be ascribed to slightly weakened interlayer interaction and partially lost edge cyano groups.Moreover, the introduced W-N 6 centers promote the trapping and storage of photoelectrons, retarding the electron delocalization.However, it is worthy to state that, those localized photoelectrons in W-N 6 centers would be mostly utilized in photocatalytic reaction systems, rather than recombination, owing to the cocatalyst effects of W-N 6 centers and higher charge utilization efficiency, which can be revealed clearly by the following electrochemical and photoelectrochemical tests. The transient photocurrent and EIS analyses are performed to further study the charge transfer and utilization efficiency.The transient photocurrent response curves (Fig. 6c) were recorded for several on-off cycles under chopped light illumination.Limited by weak light absorption ability (Fig. 5a) and high exciton recombination possibility (Fig. 6a,b), the photocurrent density of BCN is the lowest (Fig. 6c).In comparison, owing the synergetic effects of greatly improved light absorption, inhibited exciton recombination and promoted exciton dissociation (charge delocalization) in CCN, more photoelectrons and holes are generated, and the photocurrent density of CCN is much higher than BCN.Interestingly, although the light absorption capacity and the radiative exciton recombination possibility of CCN-W is comparable to that of CCN, and the charge delocalization (exciton dissociation) dynamics in CCN-W is even restrained by the electron localization in W-N 6 centers, the photocurrent density of CCN-W is about 2 times higher than CCN.This result suggests that most photoelectrons localized in W-N 6 centers are not recombined but are utilized by the photoelectrochemical reactions on the photoelectrode surface.The charge transfer from catalyst surface to surface adsorbed O 2 molecules would be significantly enhanced in CCN-W, as evidenced by much lower O 2 desorption temperature in CCN-W than CCN (Fig. S3, O 2 -TPD result).In this regard, the surface/interfacial charge transfer and utilization efficiency over CCN-W are greatly improved, leading to the much higher photocurrent density.This result is further demonstrated by the Nyquist plot of EIS spectra (Fig. 6d).The diameter of arcs in the semicircular Nyquist plot is corresponding to the charge transfer resistance (R ct ) across the electrode/electrolyte interface.50 Obviously, the diameter of arcs in the Nyquist plot decreases in the following order: CCN-W CCN BCN, suggesting the lowest R ct and the most efficient charge transfer efficiency in CCN-W, owing to the multiple modulation effects of solvothermal-assisted W 6 -doping in reducing charge recombination.Although the CCN possess stronger O 2 affinity (Fig. S3, O 2 -TPD result), the cocatalyst role of W-N 6 centers in CCN-W facilitate the interfacial electron transfer from electrode surface to dissolved O 2 in electrolyte, reducing the R ct of CCN-W. In order to further examine the cocatalyst effects of W-N 6 centers, the electrocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) on BCN, CCN and CCN-W are evaluated through LSV spectra (Fig. 7a).All those samples show moderate CO 2 RR activity, and relatively, CCN-W has the lowest onset potential and the highest current density.As demonstrated above, W-N 6 centers is helpful in activating CO 2 molecules with moderate adsorption affinity (Fig. 4).The present results highlight the cocatalyst role of W-N 6 centers in reducing reaction barrier and accelerating reaction efficiency.On the other hand, the electrocatalytic water oxidation reaction (WOR) on BCN, CCN and CCN-W are also evaluated through LSV spectra (Fig. 7b).The lowest onset potential for WOR over CCN-W indicates that WOR half reaction is also promoted by W 6 -doping.An efficient WOR is necessary in providing protons for hydrogenation steps during CO 2 reduction.Moreover, the efficient consumption of holes for WOR is also helpful in reducing charge recombination, not to mention that the WOR half reaction is dynamically rate-limiting step in water coupled CO 2 reduction reactions.As demonstrated in Fig. 5d, the band structures of g-C 3 N 4 are regulated by W 6 -doping, giving rise to more positive VB level in CCN-W, offering photogenerated holes with stronger oxidation ability towards WOR half reaction. The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance of all samples are evaluated by water vapor-coupled photocatalytic CO 2 reduction experiments under the illumination of a 300 W full-spectrum Xenon lamp (320-780 nm).To avoid the competitive consumption of photoelectrons by O 2 , the CO 2 conversion performance over the various samples are evaluated under anaerobic conditions.Control experiments indicate that both light irradiation and photocatalyst are indispensable for effective photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.For all the three samples, CO, CH 4 and C 2 H 4 are generated as the main CO 2 reduction products (Fig. 8a), while the production of O 2 is also observed (inset of Fig. 8a) as the water oxidation product.The raw data of the GC signal for the main gas products (CH 4 CO and C 2 H 4 ) from CCN-W are presented in Fig. S5a.To identify the carbon source of the detected reduction products, 13 Cisotope labeling experiments over CCN-W was monitored (Fig. S4).Luckily, the signal at m/z 17 and m/z 29 in the results are clearly recorded, which can be definitely assigned to 13 CH 4 and 13 CO produced from 13 CO 2 , respectively.It indicates that the CO 2 was at least one of the dominant carbon sources to the recorded reduction products of CH 4 and CO.Unfortunately, the yield of C 2 H 4 is below the detection limit (5 ppm) of GC-MS, so that it cannot be detected.As a supplement, control activity experiments are operated with CCN-W under the atmosphere of Ar versus CO 2 (Fig. S5b).Obviously, the amount of detected product under Ar atmosphere is far lower than that under CO 2 atmosphere.Considering that there may be remaining a small amount of residual air (containing trace CO 2 molecules) in the reactor after Ar purging, and that the CO 2 chemisorbed on the catalyst is difficult to be completely removed under ambient conditions (Fig. 4c), it is not surprising there is still a small amount of CO and CH 4 produced, but almost no C 2 H 4 can be detected.This comparative result further confirms that the photocatalytic products are mainly originated from CO 2 reduction. As expected, the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance of CCN is much better than BCN, attributing to the improved light absorption, increased CO 2 chemisorption and higher density of photoelectrons.More importantly, the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance over CCN-W is even much better, and the CCN-W sample with optimized W 6 -doping level achieving the highest yields of CO (5.75 mol g -1 h -1 ), CH 4 (4.45 mol g -1 h -1 ) and C 2 H 4 (1.71 mol g -1 h -1 ), totally (11.91mol g -1 h -1 ) being more than 5 times higher than that of CCN, with the yields of CO (1.81 mol g -1 h -1 ), CH 4 (0.24 mol g -1 h -1 ) and C 2 H 4 (0.05 mol g -1 h -1 ).Moreover, as shown in Fig. 8b, the product selectivity of CH 4 (52.59) and C 2 H 4 (30.41) for CCN-W, calculated based on the photoelectrons utilization percentage (see details in Text S1.5), are significantly improved.The overall selectivity of hydrocarbons for CCN-W (83) is more than 2 times higher than that for CCN (41.07).The significantly improved activity and selectivity of CCN-W is ascribed to the multiple synergetic roles of introduced W-N 6 as active centers in gathering photoelectrons and CO 2 reactants, reducing reaction barrier and accelerating reaction efficiency, and stabilizing the CO intermediates moderately.The adsorption of CO intermediate on conventional g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst (BCN) is weak in adsorption strength, CO would be easily escaped from the catalyst surface.On the other hand, although the adsorption capacity and intensity of CO 2 and CO is quite strong on CCN, the photoelectrons cannot be enriched at the same active sites, and the CO hydrogenation is also restrained on CCN.As for CCN-W, the W-N 6 moieties act as active centers favor the adsorption of CO 2 and CO intermediate with moderate strength and coverage, and simultaneously, W-N 6 moieties enrich the photoelectrons, together favoring the yields of CH 4 and C 2 H 4 . In addition, the stability of CCN-W is good enough, it still shows considerable photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance after 5 h illumination, and the yields of the major CO 2 reduction product are almost linearly increased with prolonging light illumination time (Fig. 8c).The basic structures and surface composition of the collected CCN-W after photocatalytic service is also well kept unchanged, which are confirmed by XRD, FTIR and XPS spectra (Fig. S6).The visible light photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performances (Fig. 8d) of CCN-W are also tested under the illumination of solely visible light (420-780 nm) and simulated natural solar light (AM 1.5 G, 200-1100 nm) at otherwise identical operation conditions.In both cases, the CCN-W performs much better, owing to the synergetic modulations in visible light absorption, photoelectron accumulation, CO 2 activation and reactions.Notably, the wavelength-dependent apparent quantum yields (AQE) of the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reactions over CCN-W are determined by utilizing different monochromatic lights (Fig. 8e).The highest AQE (5.10) is achieved at wavelength of 350 nm, and the value of AQE is positively proportional to the wavelength-dependent light absorption capacity, further demonstrating that the present CO 2 reduction processes are dominated by the light absorption and excitation initiated photocatalytic reactions. The reductive conversion of CO 2 involves complex participation of multiple electrons and protons, and the simultaneous breaking and forming of multiple covalent bonds.To disclose the possible CO 2 conversion process during photocatalytic reactions on the CCN-W photocatalyst, the in situ DRIFTS spectra (Fig. 8 , 1500, 1610 and 1642 cm -1 ), formate species (HCOO -, 1370, 1514 and 1578 cm -1 ), and methoxy groups (-OCH 3 , 1445 and 1465 cm -1 ), are detected in the present study 50,52.Before light irradiation, CO 2 -, HCO 53.BCN is characteristic of low degree of crystallinity, low specific surface area, high density of terminal amino groups and weak interlayer interaction (enlarged interlayer distance).The major drawbacks of BCN for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction lie in the following three aspects.First, the light absorption ability of BCN is relatively quite weak, especially in the UV regions (Fig. 5).Second, the CO 2 adsorption capacity is quite low (Fig. 4).Third, the density of available photoelectrons in BCN is low (Fig. 6).All those three aspects can be largely improved in CCN, because of the synergetic effects of reduced density of terminal amino groups, reduced interlayer distance (strengthened interlayer interactions), increased specific surface area, introduced K -doping (interlayer, cave and edge sites) and edge cyano groups.Nevertheless, although CO yield from photocatalytic CO 2 reduction on CCN is largely increased from 0.21 (BCN) to 1.81 (CCN) mol g -1 h -1 , the CO selectivity was almost unchanged.The CO selectivity for CCN is 58.93 based on utilization percentage of photoelectrons (and the CO selectivity is 86.2 based on molar ratio of reduction products), which is comparable to that of BCN.Significantly, by W 6 -doping, CO selectivity can be greatly reduced to 17, while the selectivity of hydrocarbons is increased to 83, being 2 times higher than that of CCN.Moreover, the total yields of CO and hydrocarbons on CCN-W is increased by more than 5 times relative to CCN.Evidently, W 6 -doping and constructing W-N 6 as active centers in highly crystalline g-C 3 N 4 nanorods is essential in improving the CO 2 reduction efficiency and selectivity simultaneously.The multiple synergetic effects (Scheme 2) are elaborated as follows: First, the light absorption.CCN-W basically maintain the strong light harvesting ability as CCN.Relative to CCN, the light absorption capacity of CCN-W is not changed obviously after W 6 -doping, the UV absorption is slightly weakened, while the visible light absorption is slightly enhanced, which shall not be the major reason leading to the great performance improvement.Second, the charge dynamics.CCN-W and CCN have little difference in exciton recombination possibility (Fig. 6a) and exciton dissociation lifetime (Fig. 6b), and CCN-W performs even slightly worse in electron delocalization, because W-N 6 centers can accumulate and store photoelectrons by W 6 /W 5 cycling.The density of photoelectrons in CCN-W is about two times larger than CCN (Fig. 6c) and the charge utilization efficiency is improved by cocatalyst effects of W-N 6 centers, as evidenced by the lower interfacial charge transfer resistance (Fig. 6d) and lower redox reaction barrier (Fig. 7).Third, the CO 2 adsorption.Both CCN-W and CCN have considerable CO 2 and CO Scheme 2. Schematic illustration of the multifunctional role of W-N 6 active centers for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction over CCN-W.adsorption capacity and strength.Relatively, the CO 2 adsorption capacity and intensity are higher in CCN.However, the moderate adsorption affinity of CCN-W is beneficial for CO 2 activation and reaction at lower potential barrier.Finally, the catalytic reactions.Both the photoelectrons and the CO 2 molecules can be enriched at the same W-N 6 active centers in CCN-W, being crucial in promoting the CO 2 reduction efficiency by high collision possibility and low CO 2 reduction reaction barrier (Fig. 7).In contrast, the CO 2 reduction dynamics in CCN would be compromised by random distribution of free photoelectrons.Moreover, the CO 2 reduction selectivity can be improved by in-situ stabilizing the CO intermediate at W-N 6 centers with moderate affinity.Combined together, both the CO 2 reduction efficiency and selectivity of CCN-W can be greatly improved by the multifunctional W-N 6 centers, which synergistically modulate the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction processes."}, {"llm generation": "W-incorporated highly crystalline carbon nitride (CCN-W) nanorods photocatalyst", "source": "In summary, by solvothermal-assisted W-doping route, we have successfully prepared W-incorporated highly crystalline carbon nitride (CCN-W) nanorods photocatalyst for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.", "context": "In summary, by solvothermal-assisted W-doping route, we have successfully prepared W-incorporated highly crystalline carbon nitride (CCN-W) nanorods photocatalyst for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.The CCN-W with optimized W 6 -doping level exhibit excellent photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with COCH 4 and C 2 H 4 yields of 5.75, 4.45, 1.71 molg -1 h -1 , which are several times higher than those of BCN and CCN.Significantly, by W 6 -doping, CO selectivity can be greatly reduced to 17, while the selectivity of hydrocarbons is increased to 83, being 2 times higher than that of CCN.This study provides an excellent example for enhancing photocatalytic CO 2 reduction over CCN by synergetic modulation of W-N 6 active centers, which concentrate both the photoelectrons and CO 2 molecules, decrease energy barriers for CO 2 reduction, and tune the adsorption and activation of CO intermediate for promoting its following hydrogenation reaction.However, the mechanism of regulating the band structures of CCN-W after W 6doping and the generation path of multi-carbon products are still not clear enough, so the photocatalytic reduction process of the CO 2 should be further explored.

The morphology is firstly investigated using SEM images (Fig. 1a,b).As shown in Fig. 1, W 6 -doping hardly alter the basic morphology, both CCN and CCN-W are appeared as regular nanorods.The average length of nanorods is around 350 nm and the average diameter is about 70 nm.The microstructures of CCN-W are further investigated by the TEM (Fig. 1c) and HRTEM (Fig. 1d) images.The nanorod-like morphology is well preserved in CCN-W upon solvothermal-assisted W 6 -doping treatment.(Fig. 1c).Owing to the high crystallinity, the resolved lattice fringes with spacing of 0.98 nm are recorded for CCN-W, which is corresponding to the interlayer distance along c axis 7.The elemental compositions and distribution within CCN-W nanorods are further demonstrated by the EDS elemental mappings of C, N, K, W and O (Fig. 1f-j), performing on the corresponding HAADF-STEM image (Fig. 1e).Generally, C, N, K, W and O elements are uniformly distributed in the CCN-W sample, indicating that W-dopant is successfully incorporated, in addition to K and O. The XRD patterns are used to identify the phase structures of the prepared samples.As shown in Fig. 2a, two diffraction peaks at 13.1 and 27.4 are recorded, matching the typical (100) and (002) crystal planes of intrinsic BCN.The peak at 13.1 is corresponded to the inplane packing of 1D polymeric heptazine chains and the peak at 27.4 is assigned to the interlayer stacking of 2D -conjugated plane 34.In contrast, for CCN, these two peaks are located at 8.0 for (100) and 28.2 for (002), respectively.A significant shift in diffraction peaks suggests Scheme 1. Schematic diagram of the structural characteristics for CCN-W nanorods, in comparison with BCN nanosheets and CCN nanorods.the obvious changes in the local microstructures of CCN.The (100) peak is negatively shifted to a much lower angle, corresponding to enlarged distance within in-plane repeating motifs, which is probably originated from cave K doping and unfolded in-plane network associated with the removal of terminal amino groups, and sufficient in-plane covalent condensation of adjacent heptazine rings 7.In contrast, the (002) peak is otherwise positively shifted from 27.4 to 28.2 , corresponding to a decreased interlayer distance and stronger interlayer interactions 35.CCN-W shares similar two diffraction peaks as that of CCN.No other resolvable XRD peaks, especially those related to W 6 -involving species, are recorded, implying that incorporated W 6 is dominantly doped in the g-C 3 N 4 framework, but no crystalline impurities like WO 3-x , tungsten carbide, or tungsten nitride are introduced into the as-prepared CCN-W sample 36.In comparison, slight variations in diffraction peaks indeed occur for CCN-W relative to CCN.After W 6 -doping and the replacement of K by much larger W 6 , the intensity of (100) peak for CCN-W decrease to some extent, implying the increased defect density of N vacancies (N v ) and the decreased local order/periodicity of in-plane packing of heptazine units 37.Besides, after W 6 -doping and the intercalation of WO 4 2-into the interlayer, the (002) peak for CCN-W is slightly shifted negatively to a lower angle (27.9 ), relative to that for CCN.Accordingly, the calculated interlayer spacing along c axis is expanded from 0.316 nm (CCN) to 0.320 nm (CCN-W), after tungstate ions (WO 4 ) inserting into the g-C 3 N 4 interlayer.The phase structures of CCN-W-X (X 1, 2, 3) are shown in Fig. S1a. The compositional and structural changes of BCN, CCN and CCN-W are further identified by FTIR spectroscopy (Fig. 2b).All those sample exhibited similar FTIR spectra, meaning that they shared the same basic chemical structures.A broad peak in the region of 3500-2900 cm -1 is attributed to the uncondensed terminal amino group or surface hydroxyl groups.Compared with BCN, this peak is obviously weakened for CCN, indicating lesser terminal amino groups, which is attributed to the removal of terminal amino groups and full condensation of adjacent heptazine units in CCN.After solvothermal-assisted W 6 -doping, a slight enhancement of this peak for CCN-W versus CCN is possibly related to more surface hydroxyl groups on CCN-W.The bands ranging from 1700 to 1200 cm -1 are corresponding to the stretching vibrations of the conjugated CN heterocycles.The typical peak at 810 cm -1 is ascribed to the breathing vibration mode of heptazine units.2 Relatively, these bands become weaker in CCN-W versus CCN, owing to the electronic interaction between the doped W 6 ions at the cavity sites and the surrounding N atoms from adjacent heptazine units 36.In sharp contrast to BCN, a new peak at 2150 cm -1 is emerged for CCN, which is ascribed to the edge cyano groups 38.Those cyano groups are formed by breaking of the 1D polymeric heptazine chains and the opening of the heptazine ring, during molten-salt processes.Those cyano groups are generally stabilized by K , involving charge compensation.Accordingly, an accompanying peak, related to terminal cyano groups bound K (that is, K -NC 2 group) 7, is appeared at 1000 cm -1 .Notably, relative to CCN, both 2150 cm -1 peak and 1000 cm -1 peak for CCN-W become much weaker, corresponding to the loss of terminal cyano groups together with compensated K in CCN-W.The solvothermal-assisted W 6 -doping processes promote the condensation of terminal cyano groups and closure of the heptazine ring, 39 which is further supported by the following XPS result.The samples of CCN-W-X (X 1, 2, 3) exhibit similar FTIR spectra (Fig. S1b). EPR spectra (Fig. 2c) is used to investigate the defect states and charge mobility of the samples 40.All the three samples display a similar EPR peak (g 2.001), which is related to the unpaired electrons of the sp 2 -carbon in the -conjugated plane 18.The intensity of this EPR peak is sensitive to the detect density of N v or the degree of -electron delocalization.Owing to higher crystallinity and low defect density of CCN, the corresponding EPR peak of CCN is lower than BCN 7.A low defect density in CCN would reduce exciton recombination possibility and accelerate the exciton dissociation dynamics.Upon W 6 -doping, the EPR peak intensity for CCN-W is much stronger than that for CCN.It indicates that the W 6 -doping would introduce additional N v defects and W-N 6 associated the electron localization in the -conjugated plane 41. In addition, the surface chemical states of CCN and CCN-W are further identified by XPS spectra.The C 1 s spectrum (Fig. 3b) of CCN contains three components located at 284.8 eV (adventitious carbon), 286.8 eV (terminal cyano groups (-C ---N) or amino groups (C-NH x )) and 288.3 eV (sp 2 -hybridized carbon in heptazine rings (N-C--N)) 16.A positive shift to higher binding energies occurs at N-C--N peak for CCN-W (288.4 eV) relative to CCN (288.3 eV), which indicates that W 6 -doping into the cavity confined by heptazine rings decreases the electron density of N-C--N, suggesting strong electronic interactions between doped W 6 and heptazine ring 23.Meanwhile, due to solvothermal-promoted condensation of terminal cyano groups during W 6 -doping, the corresponding -C ---N peak for CCN-W weakens in intensity and shifts negatively in peak position (from 286.8 to 286.3 eV) 42.The N 1 s spectrum (Fig. 3c) of CCN can be fitted into four peaks positioned at 403.9 eV ( excitation), 401.3 eV (terminal amino groups (-NH x ) or terminal cyano groups (-C ---N)), 400.4 eV (tertiary nitrogen (N-(C) 3 )), and 398.7 eV (nitrogen in heptazine rings (C-N--C)) 43.Upon cave W 6 -doping, because of strong electron interaction between doped W 6 and heptazine ring, a positive shift to higher binding energies occur accordingly at C-N--C peak for CCN-W (398.8 eV), relative to that of CCN (398.7 eV).The lower electron density of C and N atoms in CCN-W is caused by W 6 -doping and forming W-N 6 bonding, in which electrons tend to transfer from N moieties in heptazine ring to empty orbitals of higher valence W 6 via Lewis acid-base interaction 37.It has been demonstrated that the six-fold cavity confined by heptazine rings in g-C 3 N 4 is the energetically most favorable site for anchoring W-atom and forming W-N 6 bonding 29.The resulting W-N 6 sites would be active centers for both electron storage and electron-dominated catalytic reduction reactions.Note that, the binding energy of N for each component in CCN-W is somewhat higher than that in CCN, suggesting a lower electron density, corresponding to a weaker Lewis basicity and moderate adsorption affinity to CO 2 .Besides, the C/N atomic ratio in CCN-W is higher than that in CCN (Table S1), which might be caused by the increase in defect density of N v 43.Meanwhile, the intensity of N-(C) 3 peak is enhanced for CCN-W, confirming the loss The two branches of O 1 s spectrum (Fig. 3e) for CCN are related to the surface hydroxyls (-OH) and surface adsorbed O 2 44,45.As for CCN-W, in addition to these two components, a new peak is emerged at binding energy of 530.8 eV, attributing to the W-O-W in tungstate ions (WO 4 2- ) 46.The W 4f spectra (Fig. 3d) for CCN-W could be divided into two pairs.The first pair of peaks at 37.4 and 35.3 eV belong to the W 6 , and another pair of peaks at 36.0 and 33.6 eV are attributed to the W 5 that are derived from the partial W 6 reduction as a result of W-N 6 bonding and electron transfer 23.Moreover, the binding energy of corresponding W 6 and W 5 peaks in CCN-W are lower than in WO 3-x , which is due to the bonding of W 6 and W 5 to the N atoms with a lower electronegativity than the O atoms 47.It is clearly that W 6 -dopant have been successfully incorporated into the g-C 3 N 4 framework of CCN-W, in both the cavity sites and the interlayer space.The reversible change in chemical states of W dopant (W 6 /W 5 cycle) would be important for the capture and storage of photoelectrons during photocatalytic reactions.The K 2p spectra (Fig. 3f) confirm the K incorporation in both CCN and CCN-W.The K -doping amount decreases from 3.18 in CCN to 1.37 in CCN-W (Table S1).Several reasons may account for the decrease in K -doping level in CCN-W.First, the ion exchange between W 6 and K in the cavity site will lead to a reduce in K -doping level.Second, owing to solvothermal-promoted condensation of terminal cyano groups during W 6 -doping, the amount of dangling -C ---N or C-NH x is reduced, and the compensating K ions is thus decreased, 18 being consistent with FTIR spectra. The specific surface area and pore features of the samples are determined by N 2 sorption (Fig. 4a).The N 2 sorption isotherms for CCN and CCN-W are comparable, which show a typical type-IV isotherms with H3-type hysteresis loops 34, corresponding to the mesoporous structures with wide pore size distribution (inset in Fig. 4a).The determined BET surface area (S BET ) of CCN and CCN-W are 76.5 and 57.1 m 2 g -1 , respectively, both are much higher than that of BCN (11.7 m 2 g -1 ).Higher S BET generally suggests the exposure of more active sites for reactant adsorption and activation 48,49.Because of the interfacial side by-side edge condensation of terminal amino/cyano groups and the attachments of adjacent CCN-W nanorods during solvothermal treatments, the S BET and pore volume of CCN-W are slightly decreased, relative to CCN (Table S2). CO 2 adsorption as the first step of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction is very important.According to the CO 2 adsorption curves in Fig. 4b, in the relative pressure (P/P 0 ) range of 0.1 -1, the CO 2 adsorption capacity is almost linearly related to P/P 0 for all the samples.This character suggests that CO 2 molecules are dominantly adsorbed on the samples by physical interaction, and the CO 2 adsorption capacity is mainly affected by S BET .Moreover, in the P/P 0 range of 0-0.1, the CO 2 uptakes are exponentially increased for samples CCN and CCN-W.This phenomenon indicates the existence of chemical adsorption between the two samples and CO 2 , which could be further demonstrated by CO 2 -TPD analysis (Fig. 4c).CO 2 -TPD analysis is used to disclose the chemisorption characteristics and basic sites within the samples .As shown in Fig. 4c, the weak CO 2 desorption peak for BCN is positioned at 76 C, which is attributed to the desorption of CO 2 adsorbed at the terminal amino groups (C-NH x ) on the surface.Relatively, CCN exhibits much stronger CO 2 adsorption capacity and intensity, presenting two intensive CO 2 desorption peak at much higher temperature.The two desorption peaks located at 159 and 450 C could be related to two different CO 2 adsorption sites, that are associated with the K -doping in CCN.It is reported that the alkaline metal doped in g-C 3 N 4 is easy to lose both the outermost electrons and part of the sub-outer electrons, and most of which would transfer to the surrounding N atoms, thus causing the charge redistribution of the surrounding N atoms 24.Since the conjugated system of the heptazine unit promotes electron delocalization, the basicity promoted by K ions doped in cavity confined by heptazine ring is weaker.In contrast, the K ions compensating with terminal cyano groups could promote the adjacent N atom exhibiting stronger alkalinity.In this regard, it is speculated that the CO 2 desorption peak at 159 C corresponds to the cave K -doping and K-N bonding confined by the heptazine ring, while the CO 2 desorption peak at 450 C corresponds to the K -compensated terminal cyano/amino groups 15.By comparison, both CO 2 adsorption capacity and intensity for CCN-W are weakened to some extent.The two CO 2 desorption peaks for CCN-W are centered at about 119 and 408 C. As demonstrated earlier by FTIR and XPS results, after solvothermal-assisted W 6 -doping, the portion of left K is significantly reduced together with the loss of terminal cyano groups.Meanwhile, the basicity of K bounded by terminal cyano groups would be compromised by the charge compensation effects of incorporated WO 4 2-.Moreover, the basicity of K-N bonding could be weakened by substituted W-N 6 bonding in cavity sites.In fact, the above XPS results also indicate a lower electron density and weaker Lewis basicity of N-moieties in CCN-W because of W-N 6 bonding, which would offer moderate adsorption affinity to CO 2 .In summary, both the CO 2 adsorption capacity and intensity follows the following order: CCN CCN-W BCN.A proper adsorption capacity and strength is usually beneficial for catalytic reactions, facilitating reactant activation and easing product desorption. CO is an important intermediate towards multi-electron reduction products during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, and the CO adsorption capacity and intensity largely determine the selectivity to hydrocarbons.According to the CO-TPD results (Fig. 4d), BCN has almost no CO adsorption capacity, favoring the preferential production of CO as major reduction product over BCN.In contrast, considerable CO adsorption is taken place over both CCN and CCN-W.Interestingly, the CO desorption curve for each of them is very comparable to the corresponding CO 2 desorption curve (Fig. 4c), suggesting CO and CO 2 share the same adsorption sites.In this regard, during CO 2 reduction, the in-situ produced CO intermediate can be stabilized, waiting to further hydrogenation to hydrocarbons.Moreover, CO and CO 2 adsorption capacity and intensity follows the same order: CCN CCN-W BCN.Considering that CO could be further converted to methane, ethylene and other hydrocarbon products, and moderate CO adsorption capacity and intensity is essential, it is expected that CCN-W is most suitable for selective photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to hydrocarbons. Relative to BCN, CCN exhibit an evident enhancement in light absorption intensity in both UV and visible light regions and a slight redshift in absorption edge (Fig. 5a), which could be attributed to the cooperative effects of stronger interlayer packing, extended covalent bonding in -conjugated plane, and the K -doping in CCN 11,35. Notably, after introducing W 6 -doping and associated localized impurity levels in the band gap, the absorption capacity in the visible light region is further enhanced for CCN-W, but the UV absorption is just slightly weakened because of enlarged interlayer distance after W 6 -doping (Fig. 2).The light absorption difference of CCN-W-X (X 1, 2, 3) could further demonstrate this inference (Fig. S2). The band structures were roughly estimated by combined optical and electrochemical analyses.First, the band gap energy (E g ) can be estimated from the corresponding Tauc plots (Fig. 5b) derived from the above UV-vis DRS spectra (Fig. 5a).The estimated E g of BCN, CCN and CCN-W are 2.60, 2.53 and 2.39 eV, respectively.The Mott-Schottky plots (Fig. 5c) can be used to clarify the nature/type of the semiconductor and to estimate the flat band potentials (E fb ).The Mott-Schottky plots of all samples exhibit positive slopes, which is a typical characteristic of n-type semiconductors 2,50.The E fb of samples BCN, CCN and CCN-W are estimated to be -1.53,-1.33 and -1.02 V versus the saturated Ag/AgCl (pH 6.7) reference electrode, respectively.It is widely accepted that the conduction band (CB) potential for n-type semiconductors is approximately more negative by 0.2 V as compared to that E fb 34.Meanwhile, the obtained potentials versus Ag/AgCl can be converted to the Normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) scale according to equations E Ag/AgCl E RHE -0.059 pH -0.197 and E NHE E RHE -0.059 pH 51.Thus, the CB potentials of samples BCN, CCN and CCN-W are calculated to be -1.55,-1.35 and -1.04 V vs. NHE (pH 7) respectively.In combination with the value of E g , the valence band (VB) potentials of samples BCN, CCN and CCN-W are calculated to be 1.05, 1.18 and 1.35 V vs. NHE, respectively.The band structures for samples BCN, CCN and CCN-W are illustrated in Fig. 5d.The doping of M ions (M K or W 6 ) in the cavity and forming M-N bonding will cause the charge redistribution of N atoms, affecting both CB and VB energy levels of CCN-W, because the N 2p orbitals of N atoms contribute to both the VB and CB 24.Evidently, CB potentials of BCN, CCN and CCN-W follow the following order: BCN CCN CCN-W.Higher CB potential suggest stronger electron reduction ability.Even though, the CB potentials of CCN-W is far higher than the redox potential of diverse CO 2 reduction reactions (Fig. 5d).In contrast, the VB potentials of BCN, CCN and CCN-W follow the following order: BCN CCN CCN-W.Both CB and VB positions of CCN and CCN-W have been downshift compared to BCN, which are still thermodynamically feasible for the CO 2 reduction and the H 2 O oxidation. The steady state PL spectra (Fig. 6a) and the time-resolved PL spectra (Fig. 6b) are recorded to untangle the charge dynamic process.All the three sample show a typical steady-state PL emission peak at about 460 nm, which is close to the value of absorption edge (Fig. 5a).This PL peak can be mainly related to band-to-band recombination of photoelectrons and holes 32.Obviously, the PL peak is substantially suppressed in CCN and CCN-W, relative to BCN.BCN possesses abundant terminal amino groups bonded by weak hydrogen bond within the -conjugated plane, so the intralayer charge transport is greatly blocked by potential barrier of 7.9 eV 32.Meanwhile, and interlayer distance of BCN is relatively larger because of weak van der Waals interlayer interaction, and the interlayer charge transfer is ever slower by even larger potential barrier of 33.2 eV 32.Accordingly, the charge recombination possibility is very high in BCN, giving rise to strong PL signal.In contrast, in CCN, the terminal amino groups are mostly removed, more covalent bonds are formed between adjacent heptazine units instead of hydrogen bonds.Moreover, after removing terminal amino groups, typical stacked sheet-like configuration extending along the 2D -conjugated plane for BCN is evolved into rod-like morphology extending along c axis (perpendicular to 2D -conjugated plane) for CCN (Fig. 1), the lateral dimension is greatly decreased and thus the diffusion lengths of photoelectrons from the interior to the lateral edges is shortened.Moreover, the interlayer interaction is strengthened by interlayer K -doping, resulting in reduced interlayer distance.All those aspects lead to faster charge transports and less charge recombination in CCN, yielding weak PL signal.After solvothermal-assisted W 6 -doping, while the aforementioned intralayer and interlayer structural merits of CCN are mostly remained, terminal cyano groups are largely removed, and additional W-N 6 centers are introduced to further promote the trapping and storage of photoelectrons, thus further reducing the charge recombination and weakening the PL signal in CCN-W.To gain a deeper insight into the charge transfer dynamics, the time-resolved PL decay spectra (Fig. 6b) are detected, which can be well fitted by triexponential functions (Text S1.4).The resulting time constants and relative amplitudes are listed in Table S3.The short lifetime ( 1 ) corresponds to radiative exciton recombination, while the long lifetimes ( 2 and 3 ) correspond to non-radiative recombination and energy-transfer process.Normally, faster exciton dissociation corresponds to lower exciton recombination and shorter exciton lifetime.BCN possesses the longest average exciton lifetime ( ave., 6.06 ns), suggesting the exciton dissociation is difficult in BCN, because of high charge localization within heptazine units connected by weak intralayer and interlayer intermolecular forces in BCN.In contrast, charge delocalization in CCN is greatly promoted by stronger intralayer and interlayer interactions, shorter the lateral inside-out charge transport distance, and abundant edge cyano groups and K -doping 7,18.As a result, the exciton dissociation in CCN is greatly promoted, and the corresponding ave. is reduced to 3.48 ns.Upon solvothermal-assisted W 6 -doping, the ave.for CCN-W (4.71) is slightly prolonged relative to CCN, which might be ascribed to slightly weakened interlayer interaction and partially lost edge cyano groups.Moreover, the introduced W-N 6 centers promote the trapping and storage of photoelectrons, retarding the electron delocalization.However, it is worthy to state that, those localized photoelectrons in W-N 6 centers would be mostly utilized in photocatalytic reaction systems, rather than recombination, owing to the cocatalyst effects of W-N 6 centers and higher charge utilization efficiency, which can be revealed clearly by the following electrochemical and photoelectrochemical tests. The transient photocurrent and EIS analyses are performed to further study the charge transfer and utilization efficiency.The transient photocurrent response curves (Fig. 6c) were recorded for several on-off cycles under chopped light illumination.Limited by weak light absorption ability (Fig. 5a) and high exciton recombination possibility (Fig. 6a,b), the photocurrent density of BCN is the lowest (Fig. 6c).In comparison, owing the synergetic effects of greatly improved light absorption, inhibited exciton recombination and promoted exciton dissociation (charge delocalization) in CCN, more photoelectrons and holes are generated, and the photocurrent density of CCN is much higher than BCN.Interestingly, although the light absorption capacity and the radiative exciton recombination possibility of CCN-W is comparable to that of CCN, and the charge delocalization (exciton dissociation) dynamics in CCN-W is even restrained by the electron localization in W-N 6 centers, the photocurrent density of CCN-W is about 2 times higher than CCN.This result suggests that most photoelectrons localized in W-N 6 centers are not recombined but are utilized by the photoelectrochemical reactions on the photoelectrode surface.The charge transfer from catalyst surface to surface adsorbed O 2 molecules would be significantly enhanced in CCN-W, as evidenced by much lower O 2 desorption temperature in CCN-W than CCN (Fig. S3, O 2 -TPD result).In this regard, the surface/interfacial charge transfer and utilization efficiency over CCN-W are greatly improved, leading to the much higher photocurrent density.This result is further demonstrated by the Nyquist plot of EIS spectra (Fig. 6d).The diameter of arcs in the semicircular Nyquist plot is corresponding to the charge transfer resistance (R ct ) across the electrode/electrolyte interface.50 Obviously, the diameter of arcs in the Nyquist plot decreases in the following order: CCN-W CCN BCN, suggesting the lowest R ct and the most efficient charge transfer efficiency in CCN-W, owing to the multiple modulation effects of solvothermal-assisted W 6 -doping in reducing charge recombination.Although the CCN possess stronger O 2 affinity (Fig. S3, O 2 -TPD result), the cocatalyst role of W-N 6 centers in CCN-W facilitate the interfacial electron transfer from electrode surface to dissolved O 2 in electrolyte, reducing the R ct of CCN-W. In order to further examine the cocatalyst effects of W-N 6 centers, the electrocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) on BCN, CCN and CCN-W are evaluated through LSV spectra (Fig. 7a).All those samples show moderate CO 2 RR activity, and relatively, CCN-W has the lowest onset potential and the highest current density.As demonstrated above, W-N 6 centers is helpful in activating CO 2 molecules with moderate adsorption affinity (Fig. 4).The present results highlight the cocatalyst role of W-N 6 centers in reducing reaction barrier and accelerating reaction efficiency.On the other hand, the electrocatalytic water oxidation reaction (WOR) on BCN, CCN and CCN-W are also evaluated through LSV spectra (Fig. 7b).The lowest onset potential for WOR over CCN-W indicates that WOR half reaction is also promoted by W 6 -doping.An efficient WOR is necessary in providing protons for hydrogenation steps during CO 2 reduction.Moreover, the efficient consumption of holes for WOR is also helpful in reducing charge recombination, not to mention that the WOR half reaction is dynamically rate-limiting step in water coupled CO 2 reduction reactions.As demonstrated in Fig. 5d, the band structures of g-C 3 N 4 are regulated by W 6 -doping, giving rise to more positive VB level in CCN-W, offering photogenerated holes with stronger oxidation ability towards WOR half reaction. The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance of all samples are evaluated by water vapor-coupled photocatalytic CO 2 reduction experiments under the illumination of a 300 W full-spectrum Xenon lamp (320-780 nm).To avoid the competitive consumption of photoelectrons by O 2 , the CO 2 conversion performance over the various samples are evaluated under anaerobic conditions.Control experiments indicate that both light irradiation and photocatalyst are indispensable for effective photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.For all the three samples, CO, CH 4 and C 2 H 4 are generated as the main CO 2 reduction products (Fig. 8a), while the production of O 2 is also observed (inset of Fig. 8a) as the water oxidation product.The raw data of the GC signal for the main gas products (CH 4 CO and C 2 H 4 ) from CCN-W are presented in Fig. S5a.To identify the carbon source of the detected reduction products, 13 Cisotope labeling experiments over CCN-W was monitored (Fig. S4).Luckily, the signal at m/z 17 and m/z 29 in the results are clearly recorded, which can be definitely assigned to 13 CH 4 and 13 CO produced from 13 CO 2 , respectively.It indicates that the CO 2 was at least one of the dominant carbon sources to the recorded reduction products of CH 4 and CO.Unfortunately, the yield of C 2 H 4 is below the detection limit (5 ppm) of GC-MS, so that it cannot be detected.As a supplement, control activity experiments are operated with CCN-W under the atmosphere of Ar versus CO 2 (Fig. S5b).Obviously, the amount of detected product under Ar atmosphere is far lower than that under CO 2 atmosphere.Considering that there may be remaining a small amount of residual air (containing trace CO 2 molecules) in the reactor after Ar purging, and that the CO 2 chemisorbed on the catalyst is difficult to be completely removed under ambient conditions (Fig. 4c), it is not surprising there is still a small amount of CO and CH 4 produced, but almost no C 2 H 4 can be detected.This comparative result further confirms that the photocatalytic products are mainly originated from CO 2 reduction. As expected, the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance of CCN is much better than BCN, attributing to the improved light absorption, increased CO 2 chemisorption and higher density of photoelectrons.More importantly, the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance over CCN-W is even much better, and the CCN-W sample with optimized W 6 -doping level achieving the highest yields of CO (5.75 mol g -1 h -1 ), CH 4 (4.45 mol g -1 h -1 ) and C 2 H 4 (1.71 mol g -1 h -1 ), totally (11.91mol g -1 h -1 ) being more than 5 times higher than that of CCN, with the yields of CO (1.81 mol g -1 h -1 ), CH 4 (0.24 mol g -1 h -1 ) and C 2 H 4 (0.05 mol g -1 h -1 ).Moreover, as shown in Fig. 8b, the product selectivity of CH 4 (52.59) and C 2 H 4 (30.41) for CCN-W, calculated based on the photoelectrons utilization percentage (see details in Text S1.5), are significantly improved.The overall selectivity of hydrocarbons for CCN-W (83) is more than 2 times higher than that for CCN (41.07).The significantly improved activity and selectivity of CCN-W is ascribed to the multiple synergetic roles of introduced W-N 6 as active centers in gathering photoelectrons and CO 2 reactants, reducing reaction barrier and accelerating reaction efficiency, and stabilizing the CO intermediates moderately.The adsorption of CO intermediate on conventional g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst (BCN) is weak in adsorption strength, CO would be easily escaped from the catalyst surface.On the other hand, although the adsorption capacity and intensity of CO 2 and CO is quite strong on CCN, the photoelectrons cannot be enriched at the same active sites, and the CO hydrogenation is also restrained on CCN.As for CCN-W, the W-N 6 moieties act as active centers favor the adsorption of CO 2 and CO intermediate with moderate strength and coverage, and simultaneously, W-N 6 moieties enrich the photoelectrons, together favoring the yields of CH 4 and C 2 H 4 . In addition, the stability of CCN-W is good enough, it still shows considerable photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance after 5 h illumination, and the yields of the major CO 2 reduction product are almost linearly increased with prolonging light illumination time (Fig. 8c).The basic structures and surface composition of the collected CCN-W after photocatalytic service is also well kept unchanged, which are confirmed by XRD, FTIR and XPS spectra (Fig. S6).The visible light photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performances (Fig. 8d) of CCN-W are also tested under the illumination of solely visible light (420-780 nm) and simulated natural solar light (AM 1.5 G, 200-1100 nm) at otherwise identical operation conditions.In both cases, the CCN-W performs much better, owing to the synergetic modulations in visible light absorption, photoelectron accumulation, CO 2 activation and reactions.Notably, the wavelength-dependent apparent quantum yields (AQE) of the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reactions over CCN-W are determined by utilizing different monochromatic lights (Fig. 8e).The highest AQE (5.10) is achieved at wavelength of 350 nm, and the value of AQE is positively proportional to the wavelength-dependent light absorption capacity, further demonstrating that the present CO 2 reduction processes are dominated by the light absorption and excitation initiated photocatalytic reactions. The reductive conversion of CO 2 involves complex participation of multiple electrons and protons, and the simultaneous breaking and forming of multiple covalent bonds.To disclose the possible CO 2 conversion process during photocatalytic reactions on the CCN-W photocatalyst, the in situ DRIFTS spectra (Fig. 8 , 1500, 1610 and 1642 cm -1 ), formate species (HCOO -, 1370, 1514 and 1578 cm -1 ), and methoxy groups (-OCH 3 , 1445 and 1465 cm -1 ), are detected in the present study 50,52.Before light irradiation, CO 2 -, HCO 53.BCN is characteristic of low degree of crystallinity, low specific surface area, high density of terminal amino groups and weak interlayer interaction (enlarged interlayer distance).The major drawbacks of BCN for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction lie in the following three aspects.First, the light absorption ability of BCN is relatively quite weak, especially in the UV regions (Fig. 5).Second, the CO 2 adsorption capacity is quite low (Fig. 4).Third, the density of available photoelectrons in BCN is low (Fig. 6).All those three aspects can be largely improved in CCN, because of the synergetic effects of reduced density of terminal amino groups, reduced interlayer distance (strengthened interlayer interactions), increased specific surface area, introduced K -doping (interlayer, cave and edge sites) and edge cyano groups.Nevertheless, although CO yield from photocatalytic CO 2 reduction on CCN is largely increased from 0.21 (BCN) to 1.81 (CCN) mol g -1 h -1 , the CO selectivity was almost unchanged.The CO selectivity for CCN is 58.93 based on utilization percentage of photoelectrons (and the CO selectivity is 86.2 based on molar ratio of reduction products), which is comparable to that of BCN.Significantly, by W 6 -doping, CO selectivity can be greatly reduced to 17, while the selectivity of hydrocarbons is increased to 83, being 2 times higher than that of CCN.Moreover, the total yields of CO and hydrocarbons on CCN-W is increased by more than 5 times relative to CCN.Evidently, W 6 -doping and constructing W-N 6 as active centers in highly crystalline g-C 3 N 4 nanorods is essential in improving the CO 2 reduction efficiency and selectivity simultaneously.The multiple synergetic effects (Scheme 2) are elaborated as follows: First, the light absorption.CCN-W basically maintain the strong light harvesting ability as CCN.Relative to CCN, the light absorption capacity of CCN-W is not changed obviously after W 6 -doping, the UV absorption is slightly weakened, while the visible light absorption is slightly enhanced, which shall not be the major reason leading to the great performance improvement.Second, the charge dynamics.CCN-W and CCN have little difference in exciton recombination possibility (Fig. 6a) and exciton dissociation lifetime (Fig. 6b), and CCN-W performs even slightly worse in electron delocalization, because W-N 6 centers can accumulate and store photoelectrons by W 6 /W 5 cycling.The density of photoelectrons in CCN-W is about two times larger than CCN (Fig. 6c) and the charge utilization efficiency is improved by cocatalyst effects of W-N 6 centers, as evidenced by the lower interfacial charge transfer resistance (Fig. 6d) and lower redox reaction barrier (Fig. 7).Third, the CO 2 adsorption.Both CCN-W and CCN have considerable CO 2 and CO Scheme 2. Schematic illustration of the multifunctional role of W-N 6 active centers for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction over CCN-W.adsorption capacity and strength.Relatively, the CO 2 adsorption capacity and intensity are higher in CCN.However, the moderate adsorption affinity of CCN-W is beneficial for CO 2 activation and reaction at lower potential barrier.Finally, the catalytic reactions.Both the photoelectrons and the CO 2 molecules can be enriched at the same W-N 6 active centers in CCN-W, being crucial in promoting the CO 2 reduction efficiency by high collision possibility and low CO 2 reduction reaction barrier (Fig. 7).In contrast, the CO 2 reduction dynamics in CCN would be compromised by random distribution of free photoelectrons.Moreover, the CO 2 reduction selectivity can be improved by in-situ stabilizing the CO intermediate at W-N 6 centers with moderate affinity.Combined together, both the CO 2 reduction efficiency and selectivity of CCN-W can be greatly improved by the multifunctional W-N 6 centers, which synergistically modulate the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction processes."}, {"llm generation": "visible light", "source": "Relative to BCN, CCN exhibit an evident enhancement in light absorption intensity in both UV and visible light regions and a slight redshift in absorption edge (Fig. 5a), which could be attributed to the cooperative effects of stronger interlayer packing, extended covalent bonding in -conjugated plane, and the K -doping in CCN 11,35.", "context": "The microstructural characteristics of CCN-W nanorods are illustrated in Scheme 1, in comparison with CCN nanorods and BCN.BCN (Scheme 1, left) is characteristic of high density of terminal amino groups and weak interlayer interaction (enlarged interlayer distance) 32.In contrast, CCN (Scheme 1, middle) has reduced density of terminal amino groups and reduced interlayer distance (strengthened interlayer interactions) 7.Moreover, as clearly demonstrated previously, K -doping and terminal cyano groups are normally introduced into CCN during molten-salt treatment processes 13.The K -doping often present in three positions (Scheme 1): intercalated into the CCN interlayer; doped in the cavity confined by adjacent heptazine units or acting as charge compensator for the terminal cyano/amino groups.K -doping is important in tuning the charge transfer dynamics of CCN.The K intercalation induce a unique built-in electric field (BIEF), benefiting the interlayer electron transfer 33.Meanwhile, the cave K doping introduce new delivery paths for increasing electron delocalization, facilitating the intralayer transfer of photoelectrons between the adjacent heptazine rings 13.CCN-W are prepared by simply treating as-prepared K -doped CCN in the presence of W(CO) 6 under solvothermal conditions.As will be further demonstrated later, during the solvothermal treatment process, a portion of tungsten ions (W 6 ) will replace K in the cavity through ion exchange, forming W-N 6 bonding by six-fold coordinating with the surrounding N atoms from the adjacent heptazine units (Scheme 1, right).Meanwhile, a part of incorporated tungsten, existing in the form of tungstate ions (e.g.WO 4 ), enters into the g-C 3 N 4 interlayer to compensate with intercalated K ions.In addition, because of solvothermal-assisted side by side edge re-polymerization of CCN-W nanorods, the density of edge cyano groups are reduced to some extent, and accordingly, the amounts of compensating K is also reduced.The illustrated microstructural features of CCN-W are further demonstrated below by combining the microscopical and spectrometric characterizations (Figs.123). The morphology is firstly investigated using SEM images (Fig. 1a,b).As shown in Fig. 1, W 6 -doping hardly alter the basic morphology, both CCN and CCN-W are appeared as regular nanorods.The average length of nanorods is around 350 nm and the average diameter is about 70 nm.The microstructures of CCN-W are further investigated by the TEM (Fig. 1c) and HRTEM (Fig. 1d) images.The nanorod-like morphology is well preserved in CCN-W upon solvothermal-assisted W 6 -doping treatment.(Fig. 1c).Owing to the high crystallinity, the resolved lattice fringes with spacing of 0.98 nm are recorded for CCN-W, which is corresponding to the interlayer distance along c axis 7.The elemental compositions and distribution within CCN-W nanorods are further demonstrated by the EDS elemental mappings of C, N, K, W and O (Fig. 1f-j), performing on the corresponding HAADF-STEM image (Fig. 1e).Generally, C, N, K, W and O elements are uniformly distributed in the CCN-W sample, indicating that W-dopant is successfully incorporated, in addition to K and O. The XRD patterns are used to identify the phase structures of the prepared samples.As shown in Fig. 2a, two diffraction peaks at 13.1 and 27.4 are recorded, matching the typical (100) and (002) crystal planes of intrinsic BCN.The peak at 13.1 is corresponded to the inplane packing of 1D polymeric heptazine chains and the peak at 27.4 is assigned to the interlayer stacking of 2D -conjugated plane 34.In contrast, for CCN, these two peaks are located at 8.0 for (100) and 28.2 for (002), respectively.A significant shift in diffraction peaks suggests Scheme 1. Schematic diagram of the structural characteristics for CCN-W nanorods, in comparison with BCN nanosheets and CCN nanorods.the obvious changes in the local microstructures of CCN.The (100) peak is negatively shifted to a much lower angle, corresponding to enlarged distance within in-plane repeating motifs, which is probably originated from cave K doping and unfolded in-plane network associated with the removal of terminal amino groups, and sufficient in-plane covalent condensation of adjacent heptazine rings 7.In contrast, the (002) peak is otherwise positively shifted from 27.4 to 28.2 , corresponding to a decreased interlayer distance and stronger interlayer interactions 35.CCN-W shares similar two diffraction peaks as that of CCN.No other resolvable XRD peaks, especially those related to W 6 -involving species, are recorded, implying that incorporated W 6 is dominantly doped in the g-C 3 N 4 framework, but no crystalline impurities like WO 3-x , tungsten carbide, or tungsten nitride are introduced into the as-prepared CCN-W sample 36.In comparison, slight variations in diffraction peaks indeed occur for CCN-W relative to CCN.After W 6 -doping and the replacement of K by much larger W 6 , the intensity of (100) peak for CCN-W decrease to some extent, implying the increased defect density of N vacancies (N v ) and the decreased local order/periodicity of in-plane packing of heptazine units 37.Besides, after W 6 -doping and the intercalation of WO 4 2-into the interlayer, the (002) peak for CCN-W is slightly shifted negatively to a lower angle (27.9 ), relative to that for CCN.Accordingly, the calculated interlayer spacing along c axis is expanded from 0.316 nm (CCN) to 0.320 nm (CCN-W), after tungstate ions (WO 4 ) inserting into the g-C 3 N 4 interlayer.The phase structures of CCN-W-X (X 1, 2, 3) are shown in Fig. S1a. The compositional and structural changes of BCN, CCN and CCN-W are further identified by FTIR spectroscopy (Fig. 2b).All those sample exhibited similar FTIR spectra, meaning that they shared the same basic chemical structures.A broad peak in the region of 3500-2900 cm -1 is attributed to the uncondensed terminal amino group or surface hydroxyl groups.Compared with BCN, this peak is obviously weakened for CCN, indicating lesser terminal amino groups, which is attributed to the removal of terminal amino groups and full condensation of adjacent heptazine units in CCN.After solvothermal-assisted W 6 -doping, a slight enhancement of this peak for CCN-W versus CCN is possibly related to more surface hydroxyl groups on CCN-W.The bands ranging from 1700 to 1200 cm -1 are corresponding to the stretching vibrations of the conjugated CN heterocycles.The typical peak at 810 cm -1 is ascribed to the breathing vibration mode of heptazine units.2 Relatively, these bands become weaker in CCN-W versus CCN, owing to the electronic interaction between the doped W 6 ions at the cavity sites and the surrounding N atoms from adjacent heptazine units 36.In sharp contrast to BCN, a new peak at 2150 cm -1 is emerged for CCN, which is ascribed to the edge cyano groups 38.Those cyano groups are formed by breaking of the 1D polymeric heptazine chains and the opening of the heptazine ring, during molten-salt processes.Those cyano groups are generally stabilized by K , involving charge compensation.Accordingly, an accompanying peak, related to terminal cyano groups bound K (that is, K -NC 2 group) 7, is appeared at 1000 cm -1 .Notably, relative to CCN, both 2150 cm -1 peak and 1000 cm -1 peak for CCN-W become much weaker, corresponding to the loss of terminal cyano groups together with compensated K in CCN-W.The solvothermal-assisted W 6 -doping processes promote the condensation of terminal cyano groups and closure of the heptazine ring, 39 which is further supported by the following XPS result.The samples of CCN-W-X (X 1, 2, 3) exhibit similar FTIR spectra (Fig. S1b). EPR spectra (Fig. 2c) is used to investigate the defect states and charge mobility of the samples 40.All the three samples display a similar EPR peak (g 2.001), which is related to the unpaired electrons of the sp 2 -carbon in the -conjugated plane 18.The intensity of this EPR peak is sensitive to the detect density of N v or the degree of -electron delocalization.Owing to higher crystallinity and low defect density of CCN, the corresponding EPR peak of CCN is lower than BCN 7.A low defect density in CCN would reduce exciton recombination possibility and accelerate the exciton dissociation dynamics.Upon W 6 -doping, the EPR peak intensity for CCN-W is much stronger than that for CCN.It indicates that the W 6 -doping would introduce additional N v defects and W-N 6 associated the electron localization in the -conjugated plane 41. In addition, the surface chemical states of CCN and CCN-W are further identified by XPS spectra.The C 1 s spectrum (Fig. 3b) of CCN contains three components located at 284.8 eV (adventitious carbon), 286.8 eV (terminal cyano groups (-C ---N) or amino groups (C-NH x )) and 288.3 eV (sp 2 -hybridized carbon in heptazine rings (N-C--N)) 16.A positive shift to higher binding energies occurs at N-C--N peak for CCN-W (288.4 eV) relative to CCN (288.3 eV), which indicates that W 6 -doping into the cavity confined by heptazine rings decreases the electron density of N-C--N, suggesting strong electronic interactions between doped W 6 and heptazine ring 23.Meanwhile, due to solvothermal-promoted condensation of terminal cyano groups during W 6 -doping, the corresponding -C ---N peak for CCN-W weakens in intensity and shifts negatively in peak position (from 286.8 to 286.3 eV) 42.The N 1 s spectrum (Fig. 3c) of CCN can be fitted into four peaks positioned at 403.9 eV ( excitation), 401.3 eV (terminal amino groups (-NH x ) or terminal cyano groups (-C ---N)), 400.4 eV (tertiary nitrogen (N-(C) 3 )), and 398.7 eV (nitrogen in heptazine rings (C-N--C)) 43.Upon cave W 6 -doping, because of strong electron interaction between doped W 6 and heptazine ring, a positive shift to higher binding energies occur accordingly at C-N--C peak for CCN-W (398.8 eV), relative to that of CCN (398.7 eV).The lower electron density of C and N atoms in CCN-W is caused by W 6 -doping and forming W-N 6 bonding, in which electrons tend to transfer from N moieties in heptazine ring to empty orbitals of higher valence W 6 via Lewis acid-base interaction 37.It has been demonstrated that the six-fold cavity confined by heptazine rings in g-C 3 N 4 is the energetically most favorable site for anchoring W-atom and forming W-N 6 bonding 29.The resulting W-N 6 sites would be active centers for both electron storage and electron-dominated catalytic reduction reactions.Note that, the binding energy of N for each component in CCN-W is somewhat higher than that in CCN, suggesting a lower electron density, corresponding to a weaker Lewis basicity and moderate adsorption affinity to CO 2 .Besides, the C/N atomic ratio in CCN-W is higher than that in CCN (Table S1), which might be caused by the increase in defect density of N v 43.Meanwhile, the intensity of N-(C) 3 peak is enhanced for CCN-W, confirming the loss The two branches of O 1 s spectrum (Fig. 3e) for CCN are related to the surface hydroxyls (-OH) and surface adsorbed O 2 44,45.As for CCN-W, in addition to these two components, a new peak is emerged at binding energy of 530.8 eV, attributing to the W-O-W in tungstate ions (WO 4 2- ) 46.The W 4f spectra (Fig. 3d) for CCN-W could be divided into two pairs.The first pair of peaks at 37.4 and 35.3 eV belong to the W 6 , and another pair of peaks at 36.0 and 33.6 eV are attributed to the W 5 that are derived from the partial W 6 reduction as a result of W-N 6 bonding and electron transfer 23.Moreover, the binding energy of corresponding W 6 and W 5 peaks in CCN-W are lower than in WO 3-x , which is due to the bonding of W 6 and W 5 to the N atoms with a lower electronegativity than the O atoms 47.It is clearly that W 6 -dopant have been successfully incorporated into the g-C 3 N 4 framework of CCN-W, in both the cavity sites and the interlayer space.The reversible change in chemical states of W dopant (W 6 /W 5 cycle) would be important for the capture and storage of photoelectrons during photocatalytic reactions.The K 2p spectra (Fig. 3f) confirm the K incorporation in both CCN and CCN-W.The K -doping amount decreases from 3.18 in CCN to 1.37 in CCN-W (Table S1).Several reasons may account for the decrease in K -doping level in CCN-W.First, the ion exchange between W 6 and K in the cavity site will lead to a reduce in K -doping level.Second, owing to solvothermal-promoted condensation of terminal cyano groups during W 6 -doping, the amount of dangling -C ---N or C-NH x is reduced, and the compensating K ions is thus decreased, 18 being consistent with FTIR spectra. The specific surface area and pore features of the samples are determined by N 2 sorption (Fig. 4a).The N 2 sorption isotherms for CCN and CCN-W are comparable, which show a typical type-IV isotherms with H3-type hysteresis loops 34, corresponding to the mesoporous structures with wide pore size distribution (inset in Fig. 4a).The determined BET surface area (S BET ) of CCN and CCN-W are 76.5 and 57.1 m 2 g -1 , respectively, both are much higher than that of BCN (11.7 m 2 g -1 ).Higher S BET generally suggests the exposure of more active sites for reactant adsorption and activation 48,49.Because of the interfacial side by-side edge condensation of terminal amino/cyano groups and the attachments of adjacent CCN-W nanorods during solvothermal treatments, the S BET and pore volume of CCN-W are slightly decreased, relative to CCN (Table S2). CO 2 adsorption as the first step of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction is very important.According to the CO 2 adsorption curves in Fig. 4b, in the relative pressure (P/P 0 ) range of 0.1 -1, the CO 2 adsorption capacity is almost linearly related to P/P 0 for all the samples.This character suggests that CO 2 molecules are dominantly adsorbed on the samples by physical interaction, and the CO 2 adsorption capacity is mainly affected by S BET .Moreover, in the P/P 0 range of 0-0.1, the CO 2 uptakes are exponentially increased for samples CCN and CCN-W.This phenomenon indicates the existence of chemical adsorption between the two samples and CO 2 , which could be further demonstrated by CO 2 -TPD analysis (Fig. 4c).CO 2 -TPD analysis is used to disclose the chemisorption characteristics and basic sites within the samples .As shown in Fig. 4c, the weak CO 2 desorption peak for BCN is positioned at 76 C, which is attributed to the desorption of CO 2 adsorbed at the terminal amino groups (C-NH x ) on the surface.Relatively, CCN exhibits much stronger CO 2 adsorption capacity and intensity, presenting two intensive CO 2 desorption peak at much higher temperature.The two desorption peaks located at 159 and 450 C could be related to two different CO 2 adsorption sites, that are associated with the K -doping in CCN.It is reported that the alkaline metal doped in g-C 3 N 4 is easy to lose both the outermost electrons and part of the sub-outer electrons, and most of which would transfer to the surrounding N atoms, thus causing the charge redistribution of the surrounding N atoms 24.Since the conjugated system of the heptazine unit promotes electron delocalization, the basicity promoted by K ions doped in cavity confined by heptazine ring is weaker.In contrast, the K ions compensating with terminal cyano groups could promote the adjacent N atom exhibiting stronger alkalinity.In this regard, it is speculated that the CO 2 desorption peak at 159 C corresponds to the cave K -doping and K-N bonding confined by the heptazine ring, while the CO 2 desorption peak at 450 C corresponds to the K -compensated terminal cyano/amino groups 15.By comparison, both CO 2 adsorption capacity and intensity for CCN-W are weakened to some extent.The two CO 2 desorption peaks for CCN-W are centered at about 119 and 408 C. As demonstrated earlier by FTIR and XPS results, after solvothermal-assisted W 6 -doping, the portion of left K is significantly reduced together with the loss of terminal cyano groups.Meanwhile, the basicity of K bounded by terminal cyano groups would be compromised by the charge compensation effects of incorporated WO 4 2-.Moreover, the basicity of K-N bonding could be weakened by substituted W-N 6 bonding in cavity sites.In fact, the above XPS results also indicate a lower electron density and weaker Lewis basicity of N-moieties in CCN-W because of W-N 6 bonding, which would offer moderate adsorption affinity to CO 2 .In summary, both the CO 2 adsorption capacity and intensity follows the following order: CCN CCN-W BCN.A proper adsorption capacity and strength is usually beneficial for catalytic reactions, facilitating reactant activation and easing product desorption. CO is an important intermediate towards multi-electron reduction products during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, and the CO adsorption capacity and intensity largely determine the selectivity to hydrocarbons.According to the CO-TPD results (Fig. 4d), BCN has almost no CO adsorption capacity, favoring the preferential production of CO as major reduction product over BCN.In contrast, considerable CO adsorption is taken place over both CCN and CCN-W.Interestingly, the CO desorption curve for each of them is very comparable to the corresponding CO 2 desorption curve (Fig. 4c), suggesting CO and CO 2 share the same adsorption sites.In this regard, during CO 2 reduction, the in-situ produced CO intermediate can be stabilized, waiting to further hydrogenation to hydrocarbons.Moreover, CO and CO 2 adsorption capacity and intensity follows the same order: CCN CCN-W BCN.Considering that CO could be further converted to methane, ethylene and other hydrocarbon products, and moderate CO adsorption capacity and intensity is essential, it is expected that CCN-W is most suitable for selective photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to hydrocarbons. Relative to BCN, CCN exhibit an evident enhancement in light absorption intensity in both UV and visible light regions and a slight redshift in absorption edge (Fig. 5a), which could be attributed to the cooperative effects of stronger interlayer packing, extended covalent bonding in -conjugated plane, and the K -doping in CCN 11,35. Notably, after introducing W 6 -doping and associated localized impurity levels in the band gap, the absorption capacity in the visible light region is further enhanced for CCN-W, but the UV absorption is just slightly weakened because of enlarged interlayer distance after W 6 -doping (Fig. 2).The light absorption difference of CCN-W-X (X 1, 2, 3) could further demonstrate this inference (Fig. S2). The band structures were roughly estimated by combined optical and electrochemical analyses.First, the band gap energy (E g ) can be estimated from the corresponding Tauc plots (Fig. 5b) derived from the above UV-vis DRS spectra (Fig. 5a).The estimated E g of BCN, CCN and CCN-W are 2.60, 2.53 and 2.39 eV, respectively.The Mott-Schottky plots (Fig. 5c) can be used to clarify the nature/type of the semiconductor and to estimate the flat band potentials (E fb ).The Mott-Schottky plots of all samples exhibit positive slopes, which is a typical characteristic of n-type semiconductors 2,50.The E fb of samples BCN, CCN and CCN-W are estimated to be -1.53,-1.33 and -1.02 V versus the saturated Ag/AgCl (pH 6.7) reference electrode, respectively.It is widely accepted that the conduction band (CB) potential for n-type semiconductors is approximately more negative by 0.2 V as compared to that E fb 34.Meanwhile, the obtained potentials versus Ag/AgCl can be converted to the Normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) scale according to equations E Ag/AgCl E RHE -0.059 pH -0.197 and E NHE E RHE -0.059 pH 51.Thus, the CB potentials of samples BCN, CCN and CCN-W are calculated to be -1.55,-1.35 and -1.04 V vs. NHE (pH 7) respectively.In combination with the value of E g , the valence band (VB) potentials of samples BCN, CCN and CCN-W are calculated to be 1.05, 1.18 and 1.35 V vs. NHE, respectively.The band structures for samples BCN, CCN and CCN-W are illustrated in Fig. 5d.The doping of M ions (M K or W 6 ) in the cavity and forming M-N bonding will cause the charge redistribution of N atoms, affecting both CB and VB energy levels of CCN-W, because the N 2p orbitals of N atoms contribute to both the VB and CB 24.Evidently, CB potentials of BCN, CCN and CCN-W follow the following order: BCN CCN CCN-W.Higher CB potential suggest stronger electron reduction ability.Even though, the CB potentials of CCN-W is far higher than the redox potential of diverse CO 2 reduction reactions (Fig. 5d).In contrast, the VB potentials of BCN, CCN and CCN-W follow the following order: BCN CCN CCN-W.Both CB and VB positions of CCN and CCN-W have been downshift compared to BCN, which are still thermodynamically feasible for the CO 2 reduction and the H 2 O oxidation. The steady state PL spectra (Fig. 6a) and the time-resolved PL spectra (Fig. 6b) are recorded to untangle the charge dynamic process.All the three sample show a typical steady-state PL emission peak at about 460 nm, which is close to the value of absorption edge (Fig. 5a).This PL peak can be mainly related to band-to-band recombination of photoelectrons and holes 32.Obviously, the PL peak is substantially suppressed in CCN and CCN-W, relative to BCN.BCN possesses abundant terminal amino groups bonded by weak hydrogen bond within the -conjugated plane, so the intralayer charge transport is greatly blocked by potential barrier of 7.9 eV 32.Meanwhile, and interlayer distance of BCN is relatively larger because of weak van der Waals interlayer interaction, and the interlayer charge transfer is ever slower by even larger potential barrier of 33.2 eV 32.Accordingly, the charge recombination possibility is very high in BCN, giving rise to strong PL signal.In contrast, in CCN, the terminal amino groups are mostly removed, more covalent bonds are formed between adjacent heptazine units instead of hydrogen bonds.Moreover, after removing terminal amino groups, typical stacked sheet-like configuration extending along the 2D -conjugated plane for BCN is evolved into rod-like morphology extending along c axis (perpendicular to 2D -conjugated plane) for CCN (Fig. 1), the lateral dimension is greatly decreased and thus the diffusion lengths of photoelectrons from the interior to the lateral edges is shortened.Moreover, the interlayer interaction is strengthened by interlayer K -doping, resulting in reduced interlayer distance.All those aspects lead to faster charge transports and less charge recombination in CCN, yielding weak PL signal.After solvothermal-assisted W 6 -doping, while the aforementioned intralayer and interlayer structural merits of CCN are mostly remained, terminal cyano groups are largely removed, and additional W-N 6 centers are introduced to further promote the trapping and storage of photoelectrons, thus further reducing the charge recombination and weakening the PL signal in CCN-W.To gain a deeper insight into the charge transfer dynamics, the time-resolved PL decay spectra (Fig. 6b) are detected, which can be well fitted by triexponential functions (Text S1.4).The resulting time constants and relative amplitudes are listed in Table S3.The short lifetime ( 1 ) corresponds to radiative exciton recombination, while the long lifetimes ( 2 and 3 ) correspond to non-radiative recombination and energy-transfer process.Normally, faster exciton dissociation corresponds to lower exciton recombination and shorter exciton lifetime.BCN possesses the longest average exciton lifetime ( ave., 6.06 ns), suggesting the exciton dissociation is difficult in BCN, because of high charge localization within heptazine units connected by weak intralayer and interlayer intermolecular forces in BCN.In contrast, charge delocalization in CCN is greatly promoted by stronger intralayer and interlayer interactions, shorter the lateral inside-out charge transport distance, and abundant edge cyano groups and K -doping 7,18.As a result, the exciton dissociation in CCN is greatly promoted, and the corresponding ave. is reduced to 3.48 ns.Upon solvothermal-assisted W 6 -doping, the ave.for CCN-W (4.71) is slightly prolonged relative to CCN, which might be ascribed to slightly weakened interlayer interaction and partially lost edge cyano groups.Moreover, the introduced W-N 6 centers promote the trapping and storage of photoelectrons, retarding the electron delocalization.However, it is worthy to state that, those localized photoelectrons in W-N 6 centers would be mostly utilized in photocatalytic reaction systems, rather than recombination, owing to the cocatalyst effects of W-N 6 centers and higher charge utilization efficiency, which can be revealed clearly by the following electrochemical and photoelectrochemical tests. The transient photocurrent and EIS analyses are performed to further study the charge transfer and utilization efficiency.The transient photocurrent response curves (Fig. 6c) were recorded for several on-off cycles under chopped light illumination.Limited by weak light absorption ability (Fig. 5a) and high exciton recombination possibility (Fig. 6a,b), the photocurrent density of BCN is the lowest (Fig. 6c).In comparison, owing the synergetic effects of greatly improved light absorption, inhibited exciton recombination and promoted exciton dissociation (charge delocalization) in CCN, more photoelectrons and holes are generated, and the photocurrent density of CCN is much higher than BCN.Interestingly, although the light absorption capacity and the radiative exciton recombination possibility of CCN-W is comparable to that of CCN, and the charge delocalization (exciton dissociation) dynamics in CCN-W is even restrained by the electron localization in W-N 6 centers, the photocurrent density of CCN-W is about 2 times higher than CCN.This result suggests that most photoelectrons localized in W-N 6 centers are not recombined but are utilized by the photoelectrochemical reactions on the photoelectrode surface.The charge transfer from catalyst surface to surface adsorbed O 2 molecules would be significantly enhanced in CCN-W, as evidenced by much lower O 2 desorption temperature in CCN-W than CCN (Fig. S3, O 2 -TPD result).In this regard, the surface/interfacial charge transfer and utilization efficiency over CCN-W are greatly improved, leading to the much higher photocurrent density.This result is further demonstrated by the Nyquist plot of EIS spectra (Fig. 6d).The diameter of arcs in the semicircular Nyquist plot is corresponding to the charge transfer resistance (R ct ) across the electrode/electrolyte interface.50 Obviously, the diameter of arcs in the Nyquist plot decreases in the following order: CCN-W CCN BCN, suggesting the lowest R ct and the most efficient charge transfer efficiency in CCN-W, owing to the multiple modulation effects of solvothermal-assisted W 6 -doping in reducing charge recombination.Although the CCN possess stronger O 2 affinity (Fig. S3, O 2 -TPD result), the cocatalyst role of W-N 6 centers in CCN-W facilitate the interfacial electron transfer from electrode surface to dissolved O 2 in electrolyte, reducing the R ct of CCN-W. In order to further examine the cocatalyst effects of W-N 6 centers, the electrocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) on BCN, CCN and CCN-W are evaluated through LSV spectra (Fig. 7a).All those samples show moderate CO 2 RR activity, and relatively, CCN-W has the lowest onset potential and the highest current density.As demonstrated above, W-N 6 centers is helpful in activating CO 2 molecules with moderate adsorption affinity (Fig. 4).The present results highlight the cocatalyst role of W-N 6 centers in reducing reaction barrier and accelerating reaction efficiency.On the other hand, the electrocatalytic water oxidation reaction (WOR) on BCN, CCN and CCN-W are also evaluated through LSV spectra (Fig. 7b).The lowest onset potential for WOR over CCN-W indicates that WOR half reaction is also promoted by W 6 -doping.An efficient WOR is necessary in providing protons for hydrogenation steps during CO 2 reduction.Moreover, the efficient consumption of holes for WOR is also helpful in reducing charge recombination, not to mention that the WOR half reaction is dynamically rate-limiting step in water coupled CO 2 reduction reactions.As demonstrated in Fig. 5d, the band structures of g-C 3 N 4 are regulated by W 6 -doping, giving rise to more positive VB level in CCN-W, offering photogenerated holes with stronger oxidation ability towards WOR half reaction. The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance of all samples are evaluated by water vapor-coupled photocatalytic CO 2 reduction experiments under the illumination of a 300 W full-spectrum Xenon lamp (320-780 nm).To avoid the competitive consumption of photoelectrons by O 2 , the CO 2 conversion performance over the various samples are evaluated under anaerobic conditions.Control experiments indicate that both light irradiation and photocatalyst are indispensable for effective photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.For all the three samples, CO, CH 4 and C 2 H 4 are generated as the main CO 2 reduction products (Fig. 8a), while the production of O 2 is also observed (inset of Fig. 8a) as the water oxidation product.The raw data of the GC signal for the main gas products (CH 4 CO and C 2 H 4 ) from CCN-W are presented in Fig. S5a.To identify the carbon source of the detected reduction products, 13 Cisotope labeling experiments over CCN-W was monitored (Fig. S4).Luckily, the signal at m/z 17 and m/z 29 in the results are clearly recorded, which can be definitely assigned to 13 CH 4 and 13 CO produced from 13 CO 2 , respectively.It indicates that the CO 2 was at least one of the dominant carbon sources to the recorded reduction products of CH 4 and CO.Unfortunately, the yield of C 2 H 4 is below the detection limit (5 ppm) of GC-MS, so that it cannot be detected.As a supplement, control activity experiments are operated with CCN-W under the atmosphere of Ar versus CO 2 (Fig. S5b).Obviously, the amount of detected product under Ar atmosphere is far lower than that under CO 2 atmosphere.Considering that there may be remaining a small amount of residual air (containing trace CO 2 molecules) in the reactor after Ar purging, and that the CO 2 chemisorbed on the catalyst is difficult to be completely removed under ambient conditions (Fig. 4c), it is not surprising there is still a small amount of CO and CH 4 produced, but almost no C 2 H 4 can be detected.This comparative result further confirms that the photocatalytic products are mainly originated from CO 2 reduction. As expected, the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance of CCN is much better than BCN, attributing to the improved light absorption, increased CO 2 chemisorption and higher density of photoelectrons.More importantly, the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance over CCN-W is even much better, and the CCN-W sample with optimized W 6 -doping level achieving the highest yields of CO (5.75 mol g -1 h -1 ), CH 4 (4.45 mol g -1 h -1 ) and C 2 H 4 (1.71 mol g -1 h -1 ), totally (11.91mol g -1 h -1 ) being more than 5 times higher than that of CCN, with the yields of CO (1.81 mol g -1 h -1 ), CH 4 (0.24 mol g -1 h -1 ) and C 2 H 4 (0.05 mol g -1 h -1 ).Moreover, as shown in Fig. 8b, the product selectivity of CH 4 (52.59) and C 2 H 4 (30.41) for CCN-W, calculated based on the photoelectrons utilization percentage (see details in Text S1.5), are significantly improved.The overall selectivity of hydrocarbons for CCN-W (83) is more than 2 times higher than that for CCN (41.07).The significantly improved activity and selectivity of CCN-W is ascribed to the multiple synergetic roles of introduced W-N 6 as active centers in gathering photoelectrons and CO 2 reactants, reducing reaction barrier and accelerating reaction efficiency, and stabilizing the CO intermediates moderately.The adsorption of CO intermediate on conventional g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst (BCN) is weak in adsorption strength, CO would be easily escaped from the catalyst surface.On the other hand, although the adsorption capacity and intensity of CO 2 and CO is quite strong on CCN, the photoelectrons cannot be enriched at the same active sites, and the CO hydrogenation is also restrained on CCN.As for CCN-W, the W-N 6 moieties act as active centers favor the adsorption of CO 2 and CO intermediate with moderate strength and coverage, and simultaneously, W-N 6 moieties enrich the photoelectrons, together favoring the yields of CH 4 and C 2 H 4 . In addition, the stability of CCN-W is good enough, it still shows considerable photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance after 5 h illumination, and the yields of the major CO 2 reduction product are almost linearly increased with prolonging light illumination time (Fig. 8c).The basic structures and surface composition of the collected CCN-W after photocatalytic service is also well kept unchanged, which are confirmed by XRD, FTIR and XPS spectra (Fig. S6).The visible light photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performances (Fig. 8d) of CCN-W are also tested under the illumination of solely visible light (420-780 nm) and simulated natural solar light (AM 1.5 G, 200-1100 nm) at otherwise identical operation conditions.In both cases, the CCN-W performs much better, owing to the synergetic modulations in visible light absorption, photoelectron accumulation, CO 2 activation and reactions.Notably, the wavelength-dependent apparent quantum yields (AQE) of the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reactions over CCN-W are determined by utilizing different monochromatic lights (Fig. 8e).The highest AQE (5.10) is achieved at wavelength of 350 nm, and the value of AQE is positively proportional to the wavelength-dependent light absorption capacity, further demonstrating that the present CO 2 reduction processes are dominated by the light absorption and excitation initiated photocatalytic reactions. The reductive conversion of CO 2 involves complex participation of multiple electrons and protons, and the simultaneous breaking and forming of multiple covalent bonds.To disclose the possible CO 2 conversion process during photocatalytic reactions on the CCN-W photocatalyst, the in situ DRIFTS spectra (Fig. 8 , 1500, 1610 and 1642 cm -1 ), formate species (HCOO -, 1370, 1514 and 1578 cm -1 ), and methoxy groups (-OCH 3 , 1445 and 1465 cm -1 ), are detected in the present study 50,52.Before light irradiation, CO 2 -, HCO 53.BCN is characteristic of low degree of crystallinity, low specific surface area, high density of terminal amino groups and weak interlayer interaction (enlarged interlayer distance).The major drawbacks of BCN for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction lie in the following three aspects.First, the light absorption ability of BCN is relatively quite weak, especially in the UV regions (Fig. 5).Second, the CO 2 adsorption capacity is quite low (Fig. 4).Third, the density of available photoelectrons in BCN is low (Fig. 6).All those three aspects can be largely improved in CCN, because of the synergetic effects of reduced density of terminal amino groups, reduced interlayer distance (strengthened interlayer interactions), increased specific surface area, introduced K -doping (interlayer, cave and edge sites) and edge cyano groups.Nevertheless, although CO yield from photocatalytic CO 2 reduction on CCN is largely increased from 0.21 (BCN) to 1.81 (CCN) mol g -1 h -1 , the CO selectivity was almost unchanged.The CO selectivity for CCN is 58.93 based on utilization percentage of photoelectrons (and the CO selectivity is 86.2 based on molar ratio of reduction products), which is comparable to that of BCN.Significantly, by W 6 -doping, CO selectivity can be greatly reduced to 17, while the selectivity of hydrocarbons is increased to 83, being 2 times higher than that of CCN.Moreover, the total yields of CO and hydrocarbons on CCN-W is increased by more than 5 times relative to CCN.Evidently, W 6 -doping and constructing W-N 6 as active centers in highly crystalline g-C 3 N 4 nanorods is essential in improving the CO 2 reduction efficiency and selectivity simultaneously.The multiple synergetic effects (Scheme 2) are elaborated as follows: First, the light absorption.CCN-W basically maintain the strong light harvesting ability as CCN.Relative to CCN, the light absorption capacity of CCN-W is not changed obviously after W 6 -doping, the UV absorption is slightly weakened, while the visible light absorption is slightly enhanced, which shall not be the major reason leading to the great performance improvement.Second, the charge dynamics.CCN-W and CCN have little difference in exciton recombination possibility (Fig. 6a) and exciton dissociation lifetime (Fig. 6b), and CCN-W performs even slightly worse in electron delocalization, because W-N 6 centers can accumulate and store photoelectrons by W 6 /W 5 cycling.The density of photoelectrons in CCN-W is about two times larger than CCN (Fig. 6c) and the charge utilization efficiency is improved by cocatalyst effects of W-N 6 centers, as evidenced by the lower interfacial charge transfer resistance (Fig. 6d) and lower redox reaction barrier (Fig. 7).Third, the CO 2 adsorption.Both CCN-W and CCN have considerable CO 2 and CO Scheme 2. Schematic illustration of the multifunctional role of W-N 6 active centers for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction over CCN-W.adsorption capacity and strength.Relatively, the CO 2 adsorption capacity and intensity are higher in CCN.However, the moderate adsorption affinity of CCN-W is beneficial for CO 2 activation and reaction at lower potential barrier.Finally, the catalytic reactions.Both the photoelectrons and the CO 2 molecules can be enriched at the same W-N 6 active centers in CCN-W, being crucial in promoting the CO 2 reduction efficiency by high collision possibility and low CO 2 reduction reaction barrier (Fig. 7).In contrast, the CO 2 reduction dynamics in CCN would be compromised by random distribution of free photoelectrons.Moreover, the CO 2 reduction selectivity can be improved by in-situ stabilizing the CO intermediate at W-N 6 centers with moderate affinity.Combined together, both the CO 2 reduction efficiency and selectivity of CCN-W can be greatly improved by the multifunctional W-N 6 centers, which synergistically modulate the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction processes."}], "lamp": [{"llm generation": "Xenon", "source": "The light source is a 300 W Xe arc lamp (PLS-SXE300, Perfectlight, China) without (full spectrum, 320-780 nm), or with different specific filters, including, an UV cutoff filter (visible light, 420-780 nm), an AM 1.5 G filter together with a total reflector (AM 1.5 G, 200-1100 nm), or with diverse band-pass filters to obtain different monochromatic lights (350, 380, 400, 420, 435, 475, 500 nm).", "context": "CCN nanorods were firstly synthesized by a typical molten-salt approach 12.The tungsten doped CCN (CCN-W) photocatalyst was then fabricated by a facile solvothermal assisted post-processing strategy using W(CO) 6 as doping agent.For comparison, BCN was also prepared by conventional thermal pyrolysis method 30, and WO 3-x was prepared by similar solvothermal method 31.More details on the synthesis of CCN-W, BCN, CCN and WO 3-x samples were elaborated in Text S1 in the Supporting information.

The morphology is firstly investigated using SEM images (Fig. 1a,b).As shown in Fig. 1, W 6 -doping hardly alter the basic morphology, both CCN and CCN-W are appeared as regular nanorods.The average length of nanorods is around 350 nm and the average diameter is about 70 nm.The microstructures of CCN-W are further investigated by the TEM (Fig. 1c) and HRTEM (Fig. 1d) images.The nanorod-like morphology is well preserved in CCN-W upon solvothermal-assisted W 6 -doping treatment.(Fig. 1c).Owing to the high crystallinity, the resolved lattice fringes with spacing of 0.98 nm are recorded for CCN-W, which is corresponding to the interlayer distance along c axis 7.The elemental compositions and distribution within CCN-W nanorods are further demonstrated by the EDS elemental mappings of C, N, K, W and O (Fig. 1f-j), performing on the corresponding HAADF-STEM image (Fig. 1e).Generally, C, N, K, W and O elements are uniformly distributed in the CCN-W sample, indicating that W-dopant is successfully incorporated, in addition to K and O. The XRD patterns are used to identify the phase structures of the prepared samples.As shown in Fig. 2a, two diffraction peaks at 13.1 and 27.4 are recorded, matching the typical (100) and (002) crystal planes of intrinsic BCN.The peak at 13.1 is corresponded to the inplane packing of 1D polymeric heptazine chains and the peak at 27.4 is assigned to the interlayer stacking of 2D -conjugated plane 34.In contrast, for CCN, these two peaks are located at 8.0 for (100) and 28.2 for (002), respectively.A significant shift in diffraction peaks suggests Scheme 1. Schematic diagram of the structural characteristics for CCN-W nanorods, in comparison with BCN nanosheets and CCN nanorods.the obvious changes in the local microstructures of CCN.The (100) peak is negatively shifted to a much lower angle, corresponding to enlarged distance within in-plane repeating motifs, which is probably originated from cave K doping and unfolded in-plane network associated with the removal of terminal amino groups, and sufficient in-plane covalent condensation of adjacent heptazine rings 7.In contrast, the (002) peak is otherwise positively shifted from 27.4 to 28.2 , corresponding to a decreased interlayer distance and stronger interlayer interactions 35.CCN-W shares similar two diffraction peaks as that of CCN.No other resolvable XRD peaks, especially those related to W 6 -involving species, are recorded, implying that incorporated W 6 is dominantly doped in the g-C 3 N 4 framework, but no crystalline impurities like WO 3-x , tungsten carbide, or tungsten nitride are introduced into the as-prepared CCN-W sample 36.In comparison, slight variations in diffraction peaks indeed occur for CCN-W relative to CCN.After W 6 -doping and the replacement of K by much larger W 6 , the intensity of (100) peak for CCN-W decrease to some extent, implying the increased defect density of N vacancies (N v ) and the decreased local order/periodicity of in-plane packing of heptazine units 37.Besides, after W 6 -doping and the intercalation of WO 4 2-into the interlayer, the (002) peak for CCN-W is slightly shifted negatively to a lower angle (27.9 ), relative to that for CCN.Accordingly, the calculated interlayer spacing along c axis is expanded from 0.316 nm (CCN) to 0.320 nm (CCN-W), after tungstate ions (WO 4 ) inserting into the g-C 3 N 4 interlayer.The phase structures of CCN-W-X (X 1, 2, 3) are shown in Fig. S1a. The compositional and structural changes of BCN, CCN and CCN-W are further identified by FTIR spectroscopy (Fig. 2b).All those sample exhibited similar FTIR spectra, meaning that they shared the same basic chemical structures.A broad peak in the region of 3500-2900 cm -1 is attributed to the uncondensed terminal amino group or surface hydroxyl groups.Compared with BCN, this peak is obviously weakened for CCN, indicating lesser terminal amino groups, which is attributed to the removal of terminal amino groups and full condensation of adjacent heptazine units in CCN.After solvothermal-assisted W 6 -doping, a slight enhancement of this peak for CCN-W versus CCN is possibly related to more surface hydroxyl groups on CCN-W.The bands ranging from 1700 to 1200 cm -1 are corresponding to the stretching vibrations of the conjugated CN heterocycles.The typical peak at 810 cm -1 is ascribed to the breathing vibration mode of heptazine units.2 Relatively, these bands become weaker in CCN-W versus CCN, owing to the electronic interaction between the doped W 6 ions at the cavity sites and the surrounding N atoms from adjacent heptazine units 36.In sharp contrast to BCN, a new peak at 2150 cm -1 is emerged for CCN, which is ascribed to the edge cyano groups 38.Those cyano groups are formed by breaking of the 1D polymeric heptazine chains and the opening of the heptazine ring, during molten-salt processes.Those cyano groups are generally stabilized by K , involving charge compensation.Accordingly, an accompanying peak, related to terminal cyano groups bound K (that is, K -NC 2 group) 7, is appeared at 1000 cm -1 .Notably, relative to CCN, both 2150 cm -1 peak and 1000 cm -1 peak for CCN-W become much weaker, corresponding to the loss of terminal cyano groups together with compensated K in CCN-W.The solvothermal-assisted W 6 -doping processes promote the condensation of terminal cyano groups and closure of the heptazine ring, 39 which is further supported by the following XPS result.The samples of CCN-W-X (X 1, 2, 3) exhibit similar FTIR spectra (Fig. S1b). EPR spectra (Fig. 2c) is used to investigate the defect states and charge mobility of the samples 40.All the three samples display a similar EPR peak (g 2.001), which is related to the unpaired electrons of the sp 2 -carbon in the -conjugated plane 18.The intensity of this EPR peak is sensitive to the detect density of N v or the degree of -electron delocalization.Owing to higher crystallinity and low defect density of CCN, the corresponding EPR peak of CCN is lower than BCN 7.A low defect density in CCN would reduce exciton recombination possibility and accelerate the exciton dissociation dynamics.Upon W 6 -doping, the EPR peak intensity for CCN-W is much stronger than that for CCN.It indicates that the W 6 -doping would introduce additional N v defects and W-N 6 associated the electron localization in the -conjugated plane 41. In addition, the surface chemical states of CCN and CCN-W are further identified by XPS spectra.The C 1 s spectrum (Fig. 3b) of CCN contains three components located at 284.8 eV (adventitious carbon), 286.8 eV (terminal cyano groups (-C ---N) or amino groups (C-NH x )) and 288.3 eV (sp 2 -hybridized carbon in heptazine rings (N-C--N)) 16.A positive shift to higher binding energies occurs at N-C--N peak for CCN-W (288.4 eV) relative to CCN (288.3 eV), which indicates that W 6 -doping into the cavity confined by heptazine rings decreases the electron density of N-C--N, suggesting strong electronic interactions between doped W 6 and heptazine ring 23.Meanwhile, due to solvothermal-promoted condensation of terminal cyano groups during W 6 -doping, the corresponding -C ---N peak for CCN-W weakens in intensity and shifts negatively in peak position (from 286.8 to 286.3 eV) 42.The N 1 s spectrum (Fig. 3c) of CCN can be fitted into four peaks positioned at 403.9 eV ( excitation), 401.3 eV (terminal amino groups (-NH x ) or terminal cyano groups (-C ---N)), 400.4 eV (tertiary nitrogen (N-(C) 3 )), and 398.7 eV (nitrogen in heptazine rings (C-N--C)) 43.Upon cave W 6 -doping, because of strong electron interaction between doped W 6 and heptazine ring, a positive shift to higher binding energies occur accordingly at C-N--C peak for CCN-W (398.8 eV), relative to that of CCN (398.7 eV).The lower electron density of C and N atoms in CCN-W is caused by W 6 -doping and forming W-N 6 bonding, in which electrons tend to transfer from N moieties in heptazine ring to empty orbitals of higher valence W 6 via Lewis acid-base interaction 37.It has been demonstrated that the six-fold cavity confined by heptazine rings in g-C 3 N 4 is the energetically most favorable site for anchoring W-atom and forming W-N 6 bonding 29.The resulting W-N 6 sites would be active centers for both electron storage and electron-dominated catalytic reduction reactions.Note that, the binding energy of N for each component in CCN-W is somewhat higher than that in CCN, suggesting a lower electron density, corresponding to a weaker Lewis basicity and moderate adsorption affinity to CO 2 .Besides, the C/N atomic ratio in CCN-W is higher than that in CCN (Table S1), which might be caused by the increase in defect density of N v 43.Meanwhile, the intensity of N-(C) 3 peak is enhanced for CCN-W, confirming the loss The two branches of O 1 s spectrum (Fig. 3e) for CCN are related to the surface hydroxyls (-OH) and surface adsorbed O 2 44,45.As for CCN-W, in addition to these two components, a new peak is emerged at binding energy of 530.8 eV, attributing to the W-O-W in tungstate ions (WO 4 2- ) 46.The W 4f spectra (Fig. 3d) for CCN-W could be divided into two pairs.The first pair of peaks at 37.4 and 35.3 eV belong to the W 6 , and another pair of peaks at 36.0 and 33.6 eV are attributed to the W 5 that are derived from the partial W 6 reduction as a result of W-N 6 bonding and electron transfer 23.Moreover, the binding energy of corresponding W 6 and W 5 peaks in CCN-W are lower than in WO 3-x , which is due to the bonding of W 6 and W 5 to the N atoms with a lower electronegativity than the O atoms 47.It is clearly that W 6 -dopant have been successfully incorporated into the g-C 3 N 4 framework of CCN-W, in both the cavity sites and the interlayer space.The reversible change in chemical states of W dopant (W 6 /W 5 cycle) would be important for the capture and storage of photoelectrons during photocatalytic reactions.The K 2p spectra (Fig. 3f) confirm the K incorporation in both CCN and CCN-W.The K -doping amount decreases from 3.18 in CCN to 1.37 in CCN-W (Table S1).Several reasons may account for the decrease in K -doping level in CCN-W.First, the ion exchange between W 6 and K in the cavity site will lead to a reduce in K -doping level.Second, owing to solvothermal-promoted condensation of terminal cyano groups during W 6 -doping, the amount of dangling -C ---N or C-NH x is reduced, and the compensating K ions is thus decreased, 18 being consistent with FTIR spectra. The specific surface area and pore features of the samples are determined by N 2 sorption (Fig. 4a).The N 2 sorption isotherms for CCN and CCN-W are comparable, which show a typical type-IV isotherms with H3-type hysteresis loops 34, corresponding to the mesoporous structures with wide pore size distribution (inset in Fig. 4a).The determined BET surface area (S BET ) of CCN and CCN-W are 76.5 and 57.1 m 2 g -1 , respectively, both are much higher than that of BCN (11.7 m 2 g -1 ).Higher S BET generally suggests the exposure of more active sites for reactant adsorption and activation 48,49.Because of the interfacial side by-side edge condensation of terminal amino/cyano groups and the attachments of adjacent CCN-W nanorods during solvothermal treatments, the S BET and pore volume of CCN-W are slightly decreased, relative to CCN (Table S2). CO 2 adsorption as the first step of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction is very important.According to the CO 2 adsorption curves in Fig. 4b, in the relative pressure (P/P 0 ) range of 0.1 -1, the CO 2 adsorption capacity is almost linearly related to P/P 0 for all the samples.This character suggests that CO 2 molecules are dominantly adsorbed on the samples by physical interaction, and the CO 2 adsorption capacity is mainly affected by S BET .Moreover, in the P/P 0 range of 0-0.1, the CO 2 uptakes are exponentially increased for samples CCN and CCN-W.This phenomenon indicates the existence of chemical adsorption between the two samples and CO 2 , which could be further demonstrated by CO 2 -TPD analysis (Fig. 4c).CO 2 -TPD analysis is used to disclose the chemisorption characteristics and basic sites within the samples .As shown in Fig. 4c, the weak CO 2 desorption peak for BCN is positioned at 76 C, which is attributed to the desorption of CO 2 adsorbed at the terminal amino groups (C-NH x ) on the surface.Relatively, CCN exhibits much stronger CO 2 adsorption capacity and intensity, presenting two intensive CO 2 desorption peak at much higher temperature.The two desorption peaks located at 159 and 450 C could be related to two different CO 2 adsorption sites, that are associated with the K -doping in CCN.It is reported that the alkaline metal doped in g-C 3 N 4 is easy to lose both the outermost electrons and part of the sub-outer electrons, and most of which would transfer to the surrounding N atoms, thus causing the charge redistribution of the surrounding N atoms 24.Since the conjugated system of the heptazine unit promotes electron delocalization, the basicity promoted by K ions doped in cavity confined by heptazine ring is weaker.In contrast, the K ions compensating with terminal cyano groups could promote the adjacent N atom exhibiting stronger alkalinity.In this regard, it is speculated that the CO 2 desorption peak at 159 C corresponds to the cave K -doping and K-N bonding confined by the heptazine ring, while the CO 2 desorption peak at 450 C corresponds to the K -compensated terminal cyano/amino groups 15.By comparison, both CO 2 adsorption capacity and intensity for CCN-W are weakened to some extent.The two CO 2 desorption peaks for CCN-W are centered at about 119 and 408 C. As demonstrated earlier by FTIR and XPS results, after solvothermal-assisted W 6 -doping, the portion of left K is significantly reduced together with the loss of terminal cyano groups.Meanwhile, the basicity of K bounded by terminal cyano groups would be compromised by the charge compensation effects of incorporated WO 4 2-.Moreover, the basicity of K-N bonding could be weakened by substituted W-N 6 bonding in cavity sites.In fact, the above XPS results also indicate a lower electron density and weaker Lewis basicity of N-moieties in CCN-W because of W-N 6 bonding, which would offer moderate adsorption affinity to CO 2 .In summary, both the CO 2 adsorption capacity and intensity follows the following order: CCN CCN-W BCN.A proper adsorption capacity and strength is usually beneficial for catalytic reactions, facilitating reactant activation and easing product desorption. CO is an important intermediate towards multi-electron reduction products during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, and the CO adsorption capacity and intensity largely determine the selectivity to hydrocarbons.According to the CO-TPD results (Fig. 4d), BCN has almost no CO adsorption capacity, favoring the preferential production of CO as major reduction product over BCN.In contrast, considerable CO adsorption is taken place over both CCN and CCN-W.Interestingly, the CO desorption curve for each of them is very comparable to the corresponding CO 2 desorption curve (Fig. 4c), suggesting CO and CO 2 share the same adsorption sites.In this regard, during CO 2 reduction, the in-situ produced CO intermediate can be stabilized, waiting to further hydrogenation to hydrocarbons.Moreover, CO and CO 2 adsorption capacity and intensity follows the same order: CCN CCN-W BCN.Considering that CO could be further converted to methane, ethylene and other hydrocarbon products, and moderate CO adsorption capacity and intensity is essential, it is expected that CCN-W is most suitable for selective photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to hydrocarbons. Relative to BCN, CCN exhibit an evident enhancement in light absorption intensity in both UV and visible light regions and a slight redshift in absorption edge (Fig. 5a), which could be attributed to the cooperative effects of stronger interlayer packing, extended covalent bonding in -conjugated plane, and the K -doping in CCN 11,35. Notably, after introducing W 6 -doping and associated localized impurity levels in the band gap, the absorption capacity in the visible light region is further enhanced for CCN-W, but the UV absorption is just slightly weakened because of enlarged interlayer distance after W 6 -doping (Fig. 2).The light absorption difference of CCN-W-X (X 1, 2, 3) could further demonstrate this inference (Fig. S2). The band structures were roughly estimated by combined optical and electrochemical analyses.First, the band gap energy (E g ) can be estimated from the corresponding Tauc plots (Fig. 5b) derived from the above UV-vis DRS spectra (Fig. 5a).The estimated E g of BCN, CCN and CCN-W are 2.60, 2.53 and 2.39 eV, respectively.The Mott-Schottky plots (Fig. 5c) can be used to clarify the nature/type of the semiconductor and to estimate the flat band potentials (E fb ).The Mott-Schottky plots of all samples exhibit positive slopes, which is a typical characteristic of n-type semiconductors 2,50.The E fb of samples BCN, CCN and CCN-W are estimated to be -1.53,-1.33 and -1.02 V versus the saturated Ag/AgCl (pH 6.7) reference electrode, respectively.It is widely accepted that the conduction band (CB) potential for n-type semiconductors is approximately more negative by 0.2 V as compared to that E fb 34.Meanwhile, the obtained potentials versus Ag/AgCl can be converted to the Normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) scale according to equations E Ag/AgCl E RHE -0.059 pH -0.197 and E NHE E RHE -0.059 pH 51.Thus, the CB potentials of samples BCN, CCN and CCN-W are calculated to be -1.55,-1.35 and -1.04 V vs. NHE (pH 7) respectively.In combination with the value of E g , the valence band (VB) potentials of samples BCN, CCN and CCN-W are calculated to be 1.05, 1.18 and 1.35 V vs. NHE, respectively.The band structures for samples BCN, CCN and CCN-W are illustrated in Fig. 5d.The doping of M ions (M K or W 6 ) in the cavity and forming M-N bonding will cause the charge redistribution of N atoms, affecting both CB and VB energy levels of CCN-W, because the N 2p orbitals of N atoms contribute to both the VB and CB 24.Evidently, CB potentials of BCN, CCN and CCN-W follow the following order: BCN CCN CCN-W.Higher CB potential suggest stronger electron reduction ability.Even though, the CB potentials of CCN-W is far higher than the redox potential of diverse CO 2 reduction reactions (Fig. 5d).In contrast, the VB potentials of BCN, CCN and CCN-W follow the following order: BCN CCN CCN-W.Both CB and VB positions of CCN and CCN-W have been downshift compared to BCN, which are still thermodynamically feasible for the CO 2 reduction and the H 2 O oxidation. The steady state PL spectra (Fig. 6a) and the time-resolved PL spectra (Fig. 6b) are recorded to untangle the charge dynamic process.All the three sample show a typical steady-state PL emission peak at about 460 nm, which is close to the value of absorption edge (Fig. 5a).This PL peak can be mainly related to band-to-band recombination of photoelectrons and holes 32.Obviously, the PL peak is substantially suppressed in CCN and CCN-W, relative to BCN.BCN possesses abundant terminal amino groups bonded by weak hydrogen bond within the -conjugated plane, so the intralayer charge transport is greatly blocked by potential barrier of 7.9 eV 32.Meanwhile, and interlayer distance of BCN is relatively larger because of weak van der Waals interlayer interaction, and the interlayer charge transfer is ever slower by even larger potential barrier of 33.2 eV 32.Accordingly, the charge recombination possibility is very high in BCN, giving rise to strong PL signal.In contrast, in CCN, the terminal amino groups are mostly removed, more covalent bonds are formed between adjacent heptazine units instead of hydrogen bonds.Moreover, after removing terminal amino groups, typical stacked sheet-like configuration extending along the 2D -conjugated plane for BCN is evolved into rod-like morphology extending along c axis (perpendicular to 2D -conjugated plane) for CCN (Fig. 1), the lateral dimension is greatly decreased and thus the diffusion lengths of photoelectrons from the interior to the lateral edges is shortened.Moreover, the interlayer interaction is strengthened by interlayer K -doping, resulting in reduced interlayer distance.All those aspects lead to faster charge transports and less charge recombination in CCN, yielding weak PL signal.After solvothermal-assisted W 6 -doping, while the aforementioned intralayer and interlayer structural merits of CCN are mostly remained, terminal cyano groups are largely removed, and additional W-N 6 centers are introduced to further promote the trapping and storage of photoelectrons, thus further reducing the charge recombination and weakening the PL signal in CCN-W.To gain a deeper insight into the charge transfer dynamics, the time-resolved PL decay spectra (Fig. 6b) are detected, which can be well fitted by triexponential functions (Text S1.4).The resulting time constants and relative amplitudes are listed in Table S3.The short lifetime ( 1 ) corresponds to radiative exciton recombination, while the long lifetimes ( 2 and 3 ) correspond to non-radiative recombination and energy-transfer process.Normally, faster exciton dissociation corresponds to lower exciton recombination and shorter exciton lifetime.BCN possesses the longest average exciton lifetime ( ave., 6.06 ns), suggesting the exciton dissociation is difficult in BCN, because of high charge localization within heptazine units connected by weak intralayer and interlayer intermolecular forces in BCN.In contrast, charge delocalization in CCN is greatly promoted by stronger intralayer and interlayer interactions, shorter the lateral inside-out charge transport distance, and abundant edge cyano groups and K -doping 7,18.As a result, the exciton dissociation in CCN is greatly promoted, and the corresponding ave. is reduced to 3.48 ns.Upon solvothermal-assisted W 6 -doping, the ave.for CCN-W (4.71) is slightly prolonged relative to CCN, which might be ascribed to slightly weakened interlayer interaction and partially lost edge cyano groups.Moreover, the introduced W-N 6 centers promote the trapping and storage of photoelectrons, retarding the electron delocalization.However, it is worthy to state that, those localized photoelectrons in W-N 6 centers would be mostly utilized in photocatalytic reaction systems, rather than recombination, owing to the cocatalyst effects of W-N 6 centers and higher charge utilization efficiency, which can be revealed clearly by the following electrochemical and photoelectrochemical tests. The transient photocurrent and EIS analyses are performed to further study the charge transfer and utilization efficiency.The transient photocurrent response curves (Fig. 6c) were recorded for several on-off cycles under chopped light illumination.Limited by weak light absorption ability (Fig. 5a) and high exciton recombination possibility (Fig. 6a,b), the photocurrent density of BCN is the lowest (Fig. 6c).In comparison, owing the synergetic effects of greatly improved light absorption, inhibited exciton recombination and promoted exciton dissociation (charge delocalization) in CCN, more photoelectrons and holes are generated, and the photocurrent density of CCN is much higher than BCN.Interestingly, although the light absorption capacity and the radiative exciton recombination possibility of CCN-W is comparable to that of CCN, and the charge delocalization (exciton dissociation) dynamics in CCN-W is even restrained by the electron localization in W-N 6 centers, the photocurrent density of CCN-W is about 2 times higher than CCN.This result suggests that most photoelectrons localized in W-N 6 centers are not recombined but are utilized by the photoelectrochemical reactions on the photoelectrode surface.The charge transfer from catalyst surface to surface adsorbed O 2 molecules would be significantly enhanced in CCN-W, as evidenced by much lower O 2 desorption temperature in CCN-W than CCN (Fig. S3, O 2 -TPD result).In this regard, the surface/interfacial charge transfer and utilization efficiency over CCN-W are greatly improved, leading to the much higher photocurrent density.This result is further demonstrated by the Nyquist plot of EIS spectra (Fig. 6d).The diameter of arcs in the semicircular Nyquist plot is corresponding to the charge transfer resistance (R ct ) across the electrode/electrolyte interface.50 Obviously, the diameter of arcs in the Nyquist plot decreases in the following order: CCN-W CCN BCN, suggesting the lowest R ct and the most efficient charge transfer efficiency in CCN-W, owing to the multiple modulation effects of solvothermal-assisted W 6 -doping in reducing charge recombination.Although the CCN possess stronger O 2 affinity (Fig. S3, O 2 -TPD result), the cocatalyst role of W-N 6 centers in CCN-W facilitate the interfacial electron transfer from electrode surface to dissolved O 2 in electrolyte, reducing the R ct of CCN-W. In order to further examine the cocatalyst effects of W-N 6 centers, the electrocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) on BCN, CCN and CCN-W are evaluated through LSV spectra (Fig. 7a).All those samples show moderate CO 2 RR activity, and relatively, CCN-W has the lowest onset potential and the highest current density.As demonstrated above, W-N 6 centers is helpful in activating CO 2 molecules with moderate adsorption affinity (Fig. 4).The present results highlight the cocatalyst role of W-N 6 centers in reducing reaction barrier and accelerating reaction efficiency.On the other hand, the electrocatalytic water oxidation reaction (WOR) on BCN, CCN and CCN-W are also evaluated through LSV spectra (Fig. 7b).The lowest onset potential for WOR over CCN-W indicates that WOR half reaction is also promoted by W 6 -doping.An efficient WOR is necessary in providing protons for hydrogenation steps during CO 2 reduction.Moreover, the efficient consumption of holes for WOR is also helpful in reducing charge recombination, not to mention that the WOR half reaction is dynamically rate-limiting step in water coupled CO 2 reduction reactions.As demonstrated in Fig. 5d, the band structures of g-C 3 N 4 are regulated by W 6 -doping, giving rise to more positive VB level in CCN-W, offering photogenerated holes with stronger oxidation ability towards WOR half reaction. The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance of all samples are evaluated by water vapor-coupled photocatalytic CO 2 reduction experiments under the illumination of a 300 W full-spectrum Xenon lamp (320-780 nm).To avoid the competitive consumption of photoelectrons by O 2 , the CO 2 conversion performance over the various samples are evaluated under anaerobic conditions.Control experiments indicate that both light irradiation and photocatalyst are indispensable for effective photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.For all the three samples, CO, CH 4 and C 2 H 4 are generated as the main CO 2 reduction products (Fig. 8a), while the production of O 2 is also observed (inset of Fig. 8a) as the water oxidation product.The raw data of the GC signal for the main gas products (CH 4 CO and C 2 H 4 ) from CCN-W are presented in Fig. S5a.To identify the carbon source of the detected reduction products, 13 Cisotope labeling experiments over CCN-W was monitored (Fig. S4).Luckily, the signal at m/z 17 and m/z 29 in the results are clearly recorded, which can be definitely assigned to 13 CH 4 and 13 CO produced from 13 CO 2 , respectively.It indicates that the CO 2 was at least one of the dominant carbon sources to the recorded reduction products of CH 4 and CO.Unfortunately, the yield of C 2 H 4 is below the detection limit (5 ppm) of GC-MS, so that it cannot be detected.As a supplement, control activity experiments are operated with CCN-W under the atmosphere of Ar versus CO 2 (Fig. S5b).Obviously, the amount of detected product under Ar atmosphere is far lower than that under CO 2 atmosphere.Considering that there may be remaining a small amount of residual air (containing trace CO 2 molecules) in the reactor after Ar purging, and that the CO 2 chemisorbed on the catalyst is difficult to be completely removed under ambient conditions (Fig. 4c), it is not surprising there is still a small amount of CO and CH 4 produced, but almost no C 2 H 4 can be detected.This comparative result further confirms that the photocatalytic products are mainly originated from CO 2 reduction. As expected, the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance of CCN is much better than BCN, attributing to the improved light absorption, increased CO 2 chemisorption and higher density of photoelectrons.More importantly, the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance over CCN-W is even much better, and the CCN-W sample with optimized W 6 -doping level achieving the highest yields of CO (5.75 mol g -1 h -1 ), CH 4 (4.45 mol g -1 h -1 ) and C 2 H 4 (1.71 mol g -1 h -1 ), totally (11.91mol g -1 h -1 ) being more than 5 times higher than that of CCN, with the yields of CO (1.81 mol g -1 h -1 ), CH 4 (0.24 mol g -1 h -1 ) and C 2 H 4 (0.05 mol g -1 h -1 ).Moreover, as shown in Fig. 8b, the product selectivity of CH 4 (52.59) and C 2 H 4 (30.41) for CCN-W, calculated based on the photoelectrons utilization percentage (see details in Text S1.5), are significantly improved.The overall selectivity of hydrocarbons for CCN-W (83) is more than 2 times higher than that for CCN (41.07).The significantly improved activity and selectivity of CCN-W is ascribed to the multiple synergetic roles of introduced W-N 6 as active centers in gathering photoelectrons and CO 2 reactants, reducing reaction barrier and accelerating reaction efficiency, and stabilizing the CO intermediates moderately.The adsorption of CO intermediate on conventional g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst (BCN) is weak in adsorption strength, CO would be easily escaped from the catalyst surface.On the other hand, although the adsorption capacity and intensity of CO 2 and CO is quite strong on CCN, the photoelectrons cannot be enriched at the same active sites, and the CO hydrogenation is also restrained on CCN.As for CCN-W, the W-N 6 moieties act as active centers favor the adsorption of CO 2 and CO intermediate with moderate strength and coverage, and simultaneously, W-N 6 moieties enrich the photoelectrons, together favoring the yields of CH 4 and C 2 H 4 . In addition, the stability of CCN-W is good enough, it still shows considerable photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance after 5 h illumination, and the yields of the major CO 2 reduction product are almost linearly increased with prolonging light illumination time (Fig. 8c).The basic structures and surface composition of the collected CCN-W after photocatalytic service is also well kept unchanged, which are confirmed by XRD, FTIR and XPS spectra (Fig. S6).The visible light photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performances (Fig. 8d) of CCN-W are also tested under the illumination of solely visible light (420-780 nm) and simulated natural solar light (AM 1.5 G, 200-1100 nm) at otherwise identical operation conditions.In both cases, the CCN-W performs much better, owing to the synergetic modulations in visible light absorption, photoelectron accumulation, CO 2 activation and reactions.Notably, the wavelength-dependent apparent quantum yields (AQE) of the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reactions over CCN-W are determined by utilizing different monochromatic lights (Fig. 8e).The highest AQE (5.10) is achieved at wavelength of 350 nm, and the value of AQE is positively proportional to the wavelength-dependent light absorption capacity, further demonstrating that the present CO 2 reduction processes are dominated by the light absorption and excitation initiated photocatalytic reactions. The reductive conversion of CO 2 involves complex participation of multiple electrons and protons, and the simultaneous breaking and forming of multiple covalent bonds.To disclose the possible CO 2 conversion process during photocatalytic reactions on the CCN-W photocatalyst, the in situ DRIFTS spectra (Fig. 8 , 1500, 1610 and 1642 cm -1 ), formate species (HCOO -, 1370, 1514 and 1578 cm -1 ), and methoxy groups (-OCH 3 , 1445 and 1465 cm -1 ), are detected in the present study 50,52.Before light irradiation, CO 2 -, HCO 53.BCN is characteristic of low degree of crystallinity, low specific surface area, high density of terminal amino groups and weak interlayer interaction (enlarged interlayer distance).The major drawbacks of BCN for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction lie in the following three aspects.First, the light absorption ability of BCN is relatively quite weak, especially in the UV regions (Fig. 5).Second, the CO 2 adsorption capacity is quite low (Fig. 4).Third, the density of available photoelectrons in BCN is low (Fig. 6).All those three aspects can be largely improved in CCN, because of the synergetic effects of reduced density of terminal amino groups, reduced interlayer distance (strengthened interlayer interactions), increased specific surface area, introduced K -doping (interlayer, cave and edge sites) and edge cyano groups.Nevertheless, although CO yield from photocatalytic CO 2 reduction on CCN is largely increased from 0.21 (BCN) to 1.81 (CCN) mol g -1 h -1 , the CO selectivity was almost unchanged.The CO selectivity for CCN is 58.93 based on utilization percentage of photoelectrons (and the CO selectivity is 86.2 based on molar ratio of reduction products), which is comparable to that of BCN.Significantly, by W 6 -doping, CO selectivity can be greatly reduced to 17, while the selectivity of hydrocarbons is increased to 83, being 2 times higher than that of CCN.Moreover, the total yields of CO and hydrocarbons on CCN-W is increased by more than 5 times relative to CCN.Evidently, W 6 -doping and constructing W-N 6 as active centers in highly crystalline g-C 3 N 4 nanorods is essential in improving the CO 2 reduction efficiency and selectivity simultaneously.The multiple synergetic effects (Scheme 2) are elaborated as follows: First, the light absorption.CCN-W basically maintain the strong light harvesting ability as CCN.Relative to CCN, the light absorption capacity of CCN-W is not changed obviously after W 6 -doping, the UV absorption is slightly weakened, while the visible light absorption is slightly enhanced, which shall not be the major reason leading to the great performance improvement.Second, the charge dynamics.CCN-W and CCN have little difference in exciton recombination possibility (Fig. 6a) and exciton dissociation lifetime (Fig. 6b), and CCN-W performs even slightly worse in electron delocalization, because W-N 6 centers can accumulate and store photoelectrons by W 6 /W 5 cycling.The density of photoelectrons in CCN-W is about two times larger than CCN (Fig. 6c) and the charge utilization efficiency is improved by cocatalyst effects of W-N 6 centers, as evidenced by the lower interfacial charge transfer resistance (Fig. 6d) and lower redox reaction barrier (Fig. 7).Third, the CO 2 adsorption.Both CCN-W and CCN have considerable CO 2 and CO Scheme 2. Schematic illustration of the multifunctional role of W-N 6 active centers for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction over CCN-W.adsorption capacity and strength.Relatively, the CO 2 adsorption capacity and intensity are higher in CCN.However, the moderate adsorption affinity of CCN-W is beneficial for CO 2 activation and reaction at lower potential barrier.Finally, the catalytic reactions.Both the photoelectrons and the CO 2 molecules can be enriched at the same W-N 6 active centers in CCN-W, being crucial in promoting the CO 2 reduction efficiency by high collision possibility and low CO 2 reduction reaction barrier (Fig. 7).In contrast, the CO 2 reduction dynamics in CCN would be compromised by random distribution of free photoelectrons.Moreover, the CO 2 reduction selectivity can be improved by in-situ stabilizing the CO intermediate at W-N 6 centers with moderate affinity.Combined together, both the CO 2 reduction efficiency and selectivity of CCN-W can be greatly improved by the multifunctional W-N 6 centers, which synergistically modulate the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction processes."}], "reaction medium": [{"llm generation": "Gas", "source": "The water-coupled photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance was examined by a typical gas-solid interfacial reaction system under anaerobic conditions, similar to our previous studies 30.", "context": "CCN nanorods were firstly synthesized by a typical molten-salt approach 12.The tungsten doped CCN (CCN-W) photocatalyst was then fabricated by a facile solvothermal assisted post-processing strategy using W(CO) 6 as doping agent.For comparison, BCN was also prepared by conventional thermal pyrolysis method 30, and WO 3-x was prepared by similar solvothermal method 31.More details on the synthesis of CCN-W, BCN, CCN and WO 3-x samples were elaborated in Text S1 in the Supporting information.

The morphology is firstly investigated using SEM images (Fig. 1a,b).As shown in Fig. 1, W 6 -doping hardly alter the basic morphology, both CCN and CCN-W are appeared as regular nanorods.The average length of nanorods is around 350 nm and the average diameter is about 70 nm.The microstructures of CCN-W are further investigated by the TEM (Fig. 1c) and HRTEM (Fig. 1d) images.The nanorod-like morphology is well preserved in CCN-W upon solvothermal-assisted W 6 -doping treatment.(Fig. 1c).Owing to the high crystallinity, the resolved lattice fringes with spacing of 0.98 nm are recorded for CCN-W, which is corresponding to the interlayer distance along c axis 7.The elemental compositions and distribution within CCN-W nanorods are further demonstrated by the EDS elemental mappings of C, N, K, W and O (Fig. 1f-j), performing on the corresponding HAADF-STEM image (Fig. 1e).Generally, C, N, K, W and O elements are uniformly distributed in the CCN-W sample, indicating that W-dopant is successfully incorporated, in addition to K and O. The XRD patterns are used to identify the phase structures of the prepared samples.As shown in Fig. 2a, two diffraction peaks at 13.1 and 27.4 are recorded, matching the typical (100) and (002) crystal planes of intrinsic BCN.The peak at 13.1 is corresponded to the inplane packing of 1D polymeric heptazine chains and the peak at 27.4 is assigned to the interlayer stacking of 2D -conjugated plane 34.In contrast, for CCN, these two peaks are located at 8.0 for (100) and 28.2 for (002), respectively.A significant shift in diffraction peaks suggests Scheme 1. Schematic diagram of the structural characteristics for CCN-W nanorods, in comparison with BCN nanosheets and CCN nanorods.the obvious changes in the local microstructures of CCN.The (100) peak is negatively shifted to a much lower angle, corresponding to enlarged distance within in-plane repeating motifs, which is probably originated from cave K doping and unfolded in-plane network associated with the removal of terminal amino groups, and sufficient in-plane covalent condensation of adjacent heptazine rings 7.In contrast, the (002) peak is otherwise positively shifted from 27.4 to 28.2 , corresponding to a decreased interlayer distance and stronger interlayer interactions 35.CCN-W shares similar two diffraction peaks as that of CCN.No other resolvable XRD peaks, especially those related to W 6 -involving species, are recorded, implying that incorporated W 6 is dominantly doped in the g-C 3 N 4 framework, but no crystalline impurities like WO 3-x , tungsten carbide, or tungsten nitride are introduced into the as-prepared CCN-W sample 36.In comparison, slight variations in diffraction peaks indeed occur for CCN-W relative to CCN.After W 6 -doping and the replacement of K by much larger W 6 , the intensity of (100) peak for CCN-W decrease to some extent, implying the increased defect density of N vacancies (N v ) and the decreased local order/periodicity of in-plane packing of heptazine units 37.Besides, after W 6 -doping and the intercalation of WO 4 2-into the interlayer, the (002) peak for CCN-W is slightly shifted negatively to a lower angle (27.9 ), relative to that for CCN.Accordingly, the calculated interlayer spacing along c axis is expanded from 0.316 nm (CCN) to 0.320 nm (CCN-W), after tungstate ions (WO 4 ) inserting into the g-C 3 N 4 interlayer.The phase structures of CCN-W-X (X 1, 2, 3) are shown in Fig. S1a. The compositional and structural changes of BCN, CCN and CCN-W are further identified by FTIR spectroscopy (Fig. 2b).All those sample exhibited similar FTIR spectra, meaning that they shared the same basic chemical structures.A broad peak in the region of 3500-2900 cm -1 is attributed to the uncondensed terminal amino group or surface hydroxyl groups.Compared with BCN, this peak is obviously weakened for CCN, indicating lesser terminal amino groups, which is attributed to the removal of terminal amino groups and full condensation of adjacent heptazine units in CCN.After solvothermal-assisted W 6 -doping, a slight enhancement of this peak for CCN-W versus CCN is possibly related to more surface hydroxyl groups on CCN-W.The bands ranging from 1700 to 1200 cm -1 are corresponding to the stretching vibrations of the conjugated CN heterocycles.The typical peak at 810 cm -1 is ascribed to the breathing vibration mode of heptazine units.2 Relatively, these bands become weaker in CCN-W versus CCN, owing to the electronic interaction between the doped W 6 ions at the cavity sites and the surrounding N atoms from adjacent heptazine units 36.In sharp contrast to BCN, a new peak at 2150 cm -1 is emerged for CCN, which is ascribed to the edge cyano groups 38.Those cyano groups are formed by breaking of the 1D polymeric heptazine chains and the opening of the heptazine ring, during molten-salt processes.Those cyano groups are generally stabilized by K , involving charge compensation.Accordingly, an accompanying peak, related to terminal cyano groups bound K (that is, K -NC 2 group) 7, is appeared at 1000 cm -1 .Notably, relative to CCN, both 2150 cm -1 peak and 1000 cm -1 peak for CCN-W become much weaker, corresponding to the loss of terminal cyano groups together with compensated K in CCN-W.The solvothermal-assisted W 6 -doping processes promote the condensation of terminal cyano groups and closure of the heptazine ring, 39 which is further supported by the following XPS result.The samples of CCN-W-X (X 1, 2, 3) exhibit similar FTIR spectra (Fig. S1b). EPR spectra (Fig. 2c) is used to investigate the defect states and charge mobility of the samples 40.All the three samples display a similar EPR peak (g 2.001), which is related to the unpaired electrons of the sp 2 -carbon in the -conjugated plane 18.The intensity of this EPR peak is sensitive to the detect density of N v or the degree of -electron delocalization.Owing to higher crystallinity and low defect density of CCN, the corresponding EPR peak of CCN is lower than BCN 7.A low defect density in CCN would reduce exciton recombination possibility and accelerate the exciton dissociation dynamics.Upon W 6 -doping, the EPR peak intensity for CCN-W is much stronger than that for CCN.It indicates that the W 6 -doping would introduce additional N v defects and W-N 6 associated the electron localization in the -conjugated plane 41. In addition, the surface chemical states of CCN and CCN-W are further identified by XPS spectra.The C 1 s spectrum (Fig. 3b) of CCN contains three components located at 284.8 eV (adventitious carbon), 286.8 eV (terminal cyano groups (-C ---N) or amino groups (C-NH x )) and 288.3 eV (sp 2 -hybridized carbon in heptazine rings (N-C--N)) 16.A positive shift to higher binding energies occurs at N-C--N peak for CCN-W (288.4 eV) relative to CCN (288.3 eV), which indicates that W 6 -doping into the cavity confined by heptazine rings decreases the electron density of N-C--N, suggesting strong electronic interactions between doped W 6 and heptazine ring 23.Meanwhile, due to solvothermal-promoted condensation of terminal cyano groups during W 6 -doping, the corresponding -C ---N peak for CCN-W weakens in intensity and shifts negatively in peak position (from 286.8 to 286.3 eV) 42.The N 1 s spectrum (Fig. 3c) of CCN can be fitted into four peaks positioned at 403.9 eV ( excitation), 401.3 eV (terminal amino groups (-NH x ) or terminal cyano groups (-C ---N)), 400.4 eV (tertiary nitrogen (N-(C) 3 )), and 398.7 eV (nitrogen in heptazine rings (C-N--C)) 43.Upon cave W 6 -doping, because of strong electron interaction between doped W 6 and heptazine ring, a positive shift to higher binding energies occur accordingly at C-N--C peak for CCN-W (398.8 eV), relative to that of CCN (398.7 eV).The lower electron density of C and N atoms in CCN-W is caused by W 6 -doping and forming W-N 6 bonding, in which electrons tend to transfer from N moieties in heptazine ring to empty orbitals of higher valence W 6 via Lewis acid-base interaction 37.It has been demonstrated that the six-fold cavity confined by heptazine rings in g-C 3 N 4 is the energetically most favorable site for anchoring W-atom and forming W-N 6 bonding 29.The resulting W-N 6 sites would be active centers for both electron storage and electron-dominated catalytic reduction reactions.Note that, the binding energy of N for each component in CCN-W is somewhat higher than that in CCN, suggesting a lower electron density, corresponding to a weaker Lewis basicity and moderate adsorption affinity to CO 2 .Besides, the C/N atomic ratio in CCN-W is higher than that in CCN (Table S1), which might be caused by the increase in defect density of N v 43.Meanwhile, the intensity of N-(C) 3 peak is enhanced for CCN-W, confirming the loss The two branches of O 1 s spectrum (Fig. 3e) for CCN are related to the surface hydroxyls (-OH) and surface adsorbed O 2 44,45.As for CCN-W, in addition to these two components, a new peak is emerged at binding energy of 530.8 eV, attributing to the W-O-W in tungstate ions (WO 4 2- ) 46.The W 4f spectra (Fig. 3d) for CCN-W could be divided into two pairs.The first pair of peaks at 37.4 and 35.3 eV belong to the W 6 , and another pair of peaks at 36.0 and 33.6 eV are attributed to the W 5 that are derived from the partial W 6 reduction as a result of W-N 6 bonding and electron transfer 23.Moreover, the binding energy of corresponding W 6 and W 5 peaks in CCN-W are lower than in WO 3-x , which is due to the bonding of W 6 and W 5 to the N atoms with a lower electronegativity than the O atoms 47.It is clearly that W 6 -dopant have been successfully incorporated into the g-C 3 N 4 framework of CCN-W, in both the cavity sites and the interlayer space.The reversible change in chemical states of W dopant (W 6 /W 5 cycle) would be important for the capture and storage of photoelectrons during photocatalytic reactions.The K 2p spectra (Fig. 3f) confirm the K incorporation in both CCN and CCN-W.The K -doping amount decreases from 3.18 in CCN to 1.37 in CCN-W (Table S1).Several reasons may account for the decrease in K -doping level in CCN-W.First, the ion exchange between W 6 and K in the cavity site will lead to a reduce in K -doping level.Second, owing to solvothermal-promoted condensation of terminal cyano groups during W 6 -doping, the amount of dangling -C ---N or C-NH x is reduced, and the compensating K ions is thus decreased, 18 being consistent with FTIR spectra. The specific surface area and pore features of the samples are determined by N 2 sorption (Fig. 4a).The N 2 sorption isotherms for CCN and CCN-W are comparable, which show a typical type-IV isotherms with H3-type hysteresis loops 34, corresponding to the mesoporous structures with wide pore size distribution (inset in Fig. 4a).The determined BET surface area (S BET ) of CCN and CCN-W are 76.5 and 57.1 m 2 g -1 , respectively, both are much higher than that of BCN (11.7 m 2 g -1 ).Higher S BET generally suggests the exposure of more active sites for reactant adsorption and activation 48,49.Because of the interfacial side by-side edge condensation of terminal amino/cyano groups and the attachments of adjacent CCN-W nanorods during solvothermal treatments, the S BET and pore volume of CCN-W are slightly decreased, relative to CCN (Table S2). CO 2 adsorption as the first step of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction is very important.According to the CO 2 adsorption curves in Fig. 4b, in the relative pressure (P/P 0 ) range of 0.1 -1, the CO 2 adsorption capacity is almost linearly related to P/P 0 for all the samples.This character suggests that CO 2 molecules are dominantly adsorbed on the samples by physical interaction, and the CO 2 adsorption capacity is mainly affected by S BET .Moreover, in the P/P 0 range of 0-0.1, the CO 2 uptakes are exponentially increased for samples CCN and CCN-W.This phenomenon indicates the existence of chemical adsorption between the two samples and CO 2 , which could be further demonstrated by CO 2 -TPD analysis (Fig. 4c).CO 2 -TPD analysis is used to disclose the chemisorption characteristics and basic sites within the samples .As shown in Fig. 4c, the weak CO 2 desorption peak for BCN is positioned at 76 C, which is attributed to the desorption of CO 2 adsorbed at the terminal amino groups (C-NH x ) on the surface.Relatively, CCN exhibits much stronger CO 2 adsorption capacity and intensity, presenting two intensive CO 2 desorption peak at much higher temperature.The two desorption peaks located at 159 and 450 C could be related to two different CO 2 adsorption sites, that are associated with the K -doping in CCN.It is reported that the alkaline metal doped in g-C 3 N 4 is easy to lose both the outermost electrons and part of the sub-outer electrons, and most of which would transfer to the surrounding N atoms, thus causing the charge redistribution of the surrounding N atoms 24.Since the conjugated system of the heptazine unit promotes electron delocalization, the basicity promoted by K ions doped in cavity confined by heptazine ring is weaker.In contrast, the K ions compensating with terminal cyano groups could promote the adjacent N atom exhibiting stronger alkalinity.In this regard, it is speculated that the CO 2 desorption peak at 159 C corresponds to the cave K -doping and K-N bonding confined by the heptazine ring, while the CO 2 desorption peak at 450 C corresponds to the K -compensated terminal cyano/amino groups 15.By comparison, both CO 2 adsorption capacity and intensity for CCN-W are weakened to some extent.The two CO 2 desorption peaks for CCN-W are centered at about 119 and 408 C. As demonstrated earlier by FTIR and XPS results, after solvothermal-assisted W 6 -doping, the portion of left K is significantly reduced together with the loss of terminal cyano groups.Meanwhile, the basicity of K bounded by terminal cyano groups would be compromised by the charge compensation effects of incorporated WO 4 2-.Moreover, the basicity of K-N bonding could be weakened by substituted W-N 6 bonding in cavity sites.In fact, the above XPS results also indicate a lower electron density and weaker Lewis basicity of N-moieties in CCN-W because of W-N 6 bonding, which would offer moderate adsorption affinity to CO 2 .In summary, both the CO 2 adsorption capacity and intensity follows the following order: CCN CCN-W BCN.A proper adsorption capacity and strength is usually beneficial for catalytic reactions, facilitating reactant activation and easing product desorption. CO is an important intermediate towards multi-electron reduction products during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, and the CO adsorption capacity and intensity largely determine the selectivity to hydrocarbons.According to the CO-TPD results (Fig. 4d), BCN has almost no CO adsorption capacity, favoring the preferential production of CO as major reduction product over BCN.In contrast, considerable CO adsorption is taken place over both CCN and CCN-W.Interestingly, the CO desorption curve for each of them is very comparable to the corresponding CO 2 desorption curve (Fig. 4c), suggesting CO and CO 2 share the same adsorption sites.In this regard, during CO 2 reduction, the in-situ produced CO intermediate can be stabilized, waiting to further hydrogenation to hydrocarbons.Moreover, CO and CO 2 adsorption capacity and intensity follows the same order: CCN CCN-W BCN.Considering that CO could be further converted to methane, ethylene and other hydrocarbon products, and moderate CO adsorption capacity and intensity is essential, it is expected that CCN-W is most suitable for selective photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to hydrocarbons. Relative to BCN, CCN exhibit an evident enhancement in light absorption intensity in both UV and visible light regions and a slight redshift in absorption edge (Fig. 5a), which could be attributed to the cooperative effects of stronger interlayer packing, extended covalent bonding in -conjugated plane, and the K -doping in CCN 11,35. Notably, after introducing W 6 -doping and associated localized impurity levels in the band gap, the absorption capacity in the visible light region is further enhanced for CCN-W, but the UV absorption is just slightly weakened because of enlarged interlayer distance after W 6 -doping (Fig. 2).The light absorption difference of CCN-W-X (X 1, 2, 3) could further demonstrate this inference (Fig. S2). The band structures were roughly estimated by combined optical and electrochemical analyses.First, the band gap energy (E g ) can be estimated from the corresponding Tauc plots (Fig. 5b) derived from the above UV-vis DRS spectra (Fig. 5a).The estimated E g of BCN, CCN and CCN-W are 2.60, 2.53 and 2.39 eV, respectively.The Mott-Schottky plots (Fig. 5c) can be used to clarify the nature/type of the semiconductor and to estimate the flat band potentials (E fb ).The Mott-Schottky plots of all samples exhibit positive slopes, which is a typical characteristic of n-type semiconductors 2,50.The E fb of samples BCN, CCN and CCN-W are estimated to be -1.53,-1.33 and -1.02 V versus the saturated Ag/AgCl (pH 6.7) reference electrode, respectively.It is widely accepted that the conduction band (CB) potential for n-type semiconductors is approximately more negative by 0.2 V as compared to that E fb 34.Meanwhile, the obtained potentials versus Ag/AgCl can be converted to the Normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) scale according to equations E Ag/AgCl E RHE -0.059 pH -0.197 and E NHE E RHE -0.059 pH 51.Thus, the CB potentials of samples BCN, CCN and CCN-W are calculated to be -1.55,-1.35 and -1.04 V vs. NHE (pH 7) respectively.In combination with the value of E g , the valence band (VB) potentials of samples BCN, CCN and CCN-W are calculated to be 1.05, 1.18 and 1.35 V vs. NHE, respectively.The band structures for samples BCN, CCN and CCN-W are illustrated in Fig. 5d.The doping of M ions (M K or W 6 ) in the cavity and forming M-N bonding will cause the charge redistribution of N atoms, affecting both CB and VB energy levels of CCN-W, because the N 2p orbitals of N atoms contribute to both the VB and CB 24.Evidently, CB potentials of BCN, CCN and CCN-W follow the following order: BCN CCN CCN-W.Higher CB potential suggest stronger electron reduction ability.Even though, the CB potentials of CCN-W is far higher than the redox potential of diverse CO 2 reduction reactions (Fig. 5d).In contrast, the VB potentials of BCN, CCN and CCN-W follow the following order: BCN CCN CCN-W.Both CB and VB positions of CCN and CCN-W have been downshift compared to BCN, which are still thermodynamically feasible for the CO 2 reduction and the H 2 O oxidation. The steady state PL spectra (Fig. 6a) and the time-resolved PL spectra (Fig. 6b) are recorded to untangle the charge dynamic process.All the three sample show a typical steady-state PL emission peak at about 460 nm, which is close to the value of absorption edge (Fig. 5a).This PL peak can be mainly related to band-to-band recombination of photoelectrons and holes 32.Obviously, the PL peak is substantially suppressed in CCN and CCN-W, relative to BCN.BCN possesses abundant terminal amino groups bonded by weak hydrogen bond within the -conjugated plane, so the intralayer charge transport is greatly blocked by potential barrier of 7.9 eV 32.Meanwhile, and interlayer distance of BCN is relatively larger because of weak van der Waals interlayer interaction, and the interlayer charge transfer is ever slower by even larger potential barrier of 33.2 eV 32.Accordingly, the charge recombination possibility is very high in BCN, giving rise to strong PL signal.In contrast, in CCN, the terminal amino groups are mostly removed, more covalent bonds are formed between adjacent heptazine units instead of hydrogen bonds.Moreover, after removing terminal amino groups, typical stacked sheet-like configuration extending along the 2D -conjugated plane for BCN is evolved into rod-like morphology extending along c axis (perpendicular to 2D -conjugated plane) for CCN (Fig. 1), the lateral dimension is greatly decreased and thus the diffusion lengths of photoelectrons from the interior to the lateral edges is shortened.Moreover, the interlayer interaction is strengthened by interlayer K -doping, resulting in reduced interlayer distance.All those aspects lead to faster charge transports and less charge recombination in CCN, yielding weak PL signal.After solvothermal-assisted W 6 -doping, while the aforementioned intralayer and interlayer structural merits of CCN are mostly remained, terminal cyano groups are largely removed, and additional W-N 6 centers are introduced to further promote the trapping and storage of photoelectrons, thus further reducing the charge recombination and weakening the PL signal in CCN-W.To gain a deeper insight into the charge transfer dynamics, the time-resolved PL decay spectra (Fig. 6b) are detected, which can be well fitted by triexponential functions (Text S1.4).The resulting time constants and relative amplitudes are listed in Table S3.The short lifetime ( 1 ) corresponds to radiative exciton recombination, while the long lifetimes ( 2 and 3 ) correspond to non-radiative recombination and energy-transfer process.Normally, faster exciton dissociation corresponds to lower exciton recombination and shorter exciton lifetime.BCN possesses the longest average exciton lifetime ( ave., 6.06 ns), suggesting the exciton dissociation is difficult in BCN, because of high charge localization within heptazine units connected by weak intralayer and interlayer intermolecular forces in BCN.In contrast, charge delocalization in CCN is greatly promoted by stronger intralayer and interlayer interactions, shorter the lateral inside-out charge transport distance, and abundant edge cyano groups and K -doping 7,18.As a result, the exciton dissociation in CCN is greatly promoted, and the corresponding ave. is reduced to 3.48 ns.Upon solvothermal-assisted W 6 -doping, the ave.for CCN-W (4.71) is slightly prolonged relative to CCN, which might be ascribed to slightly weakened interlayer interaction and partially lost edge cyano groups.Moreover, the introduced W-N 6 centers promote the trapping and storage of photoelectrons, retarding the electron delocalization.However, it is worthy to state that, those localized photoelectrons in W-N 6 centers would be mostly utilized in photocatalytic reaction systems, rather than recombination, owing to the cocatalyst effects of W-N 6 centers and higher charge utilization efficiency, which can be revealed clearly by the following electrochemical and photoelectrochemical tests. The transient photocurrent and EIS analyses are performed to further study the charge transfer and utilization efficiency.The transient photocurrent response curves (Fig. 6c) were recorded for several on-off cycles under chopped light illumination.Limited by weak light absorption ability (Fig. 5a) and high exciton recombination possibility (Fig. 6a,b), the photocurrent density of BCN is the lowest (Fig. 6c).In comparison, owing the synergetic effects of greatly improved light absorption, inhibited exciton recombination and promoted exciton dissociation (charge delocalization) in CCN, more photoelectrons and holes are generated, and the photocurrent density of CCN is much higher than BCN.Interestingly, although the light absorption capacity and the radiative exciton recombination possibility of CCN-W is comparable to that of CCN, and the charge delocalization (exciton dissociation) dynamics in CCN-W is even restrained by the electron localization in W-N 6 centers, the photocurrent density of CCN-W is about 2 times higher than CCN.This result suggests that most photoelectrons localized in W-N 6 centers are not recombined but are utilized by the photoelectrochemical reactions on the photoelectrode surface.The charge transfer from catalyst surface to surface adsorbed O 2 molecules would be significantly enhanced in CCN-W, as evidenced by much lower O 2 desorption temperature in CCN-W than CCN (Fig. S3, O 2 -TPD result).In this regard, the surface/interfacial charge transfer and utilization efficiency over CCN-W are greatly improved, leading to the much higher photocurrent density.This result is further demonstrated by the Nyquist plot of EIS spectra (Fig. 6d).The diameter of arcs in the semicircular Nyquist plot is corresponding to the charge transfer resistance (R ct ) across the electrode/electrolyte interface.50 Obviously, the diameter of arcs in the Nyquist plot decreases in the following order: CCN-W CCN BCN, suggesting the lowest R ct and the most efficient charge transfer efficiency in CCN-W, owing to the multiple modulation effects of solvothermal-assisted W 6 -doping in reducing charge recombination.Although the CCN possess stronger O 2 affinity (Fig. S3, O 2 -TPD result), the cocatalyst role of W-N 6 centers in CCN-W facilitate the interfacial electron transfer from electrode surface to dissolved O 2 in electrolyte, reducing the R ct of CCN-W. In order to further examine the cocatalyst effects of W-N 6 centers, the electrocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) on BCN, CCN and CCN-W are evaluated through LSV spectra (Fig. 7a).All those samples show moderate CO 2 RR activity, and relatively, CCN-W has the lowest onset potential and the highest current density.As demonstrated above, W-N 6 centers is helpful in activating CO 2 molecules with moderate adsorption affinity (Fig. 4).The present results highlight the cocatalyst role of W-N 6 centers in reducing reaction barrier and accelerating reaction efficiency.On the other hand, the electrocatalytic water oxidation reaction (WOR) on BCN, CCN and CCN-W are also evaluated through LSV spectra (Fig. 7b).The lowest onset potential for WOR over CCN-W indicates that WOR half reaction is also promoted by W 6 -doping.An efficient WOR is necessary in providing protons for hydrogenation steps during CO 2 reduction.Moreover, the efficient consumption of holes for WOR is also helpful in reducing charge recombination, not to mention that the WOR half reaction is dynamically rate-limiting step in water coupled CO 2 reduction reactions.As demonstrated in Fig. 5d, the band structures of g-C 3 N 4 are regulated by W 6 -doping, giving rise to more positive VB level in CCN-W, offering photogenerated holes with stronger oxidation ability towards WOR half reaction. The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance of all samples are evaluated by water vapor-coupled photocatalytic CO 2 reduction experiments under the illumination of a 300 W full-spectrum Xenon lamp (320-780 nm).To avoid the competitive consumption of photoelectrons by O 2 , the CO 2 conversion performance over the various samples are evaluated under anaerobic conditions.Control experiments indicate that both light irradiation and photocatalyst are indispensable for effective photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.For all the three samples, CO, CH 4 and C 2 H 4 are generated as the main CO 2 reduction products (Fig. 8a), while the production of O 2 is also observed (inset of Fig. 8a) as the water oxidation product.The raw data of the GC signal for the main gas products (CH 4 CO and C 2 H 4 ) from CCN-W are presented in Fig. S5a.To identify the carbon source of the detected reduction products, 13 Cisotope labeling experiments over CCN-W was monitored (Fig. S4).Luckily, the signal at m/z 17 and m/z 29 in the results are clearly recorded, which can be definitely assigned to 13 CH 4 and 13 CO produced from 13 CO 2 , respectively.It indicates that the CO 2 was at least one of the dominant carbon sources to the recorded reduction products of CH 4 and CO.Unfortunately, the yield of C 2 H 4 is below the detection limit (5 ppm) of GC-MS, so that it cannot be detected.As a supplement, control activity experiments are operated with CCN-W under the atmosphere of Ar versus CO 2 (Fig. S5b).Obviously, the amount of detected product under Ar atmosphere is far lower than that under CO 2 atmosphere.Considering that there may be remaining a small amount of residual air (containing trace CO 2 molecules) in the reactor after Ar purging, and that the CO 2 chemisorbed on the catalyst is difficult to be completely removed under ambient conditions (Fig. 4c), it is not surprising there is still a small amount of CO and CH 4 produced, but almost no C 2 H 4 can be detected.This comparative result further confirms that the photocatalytic products are mainly originated from CO 2 reduction. As expected, the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance of CCN is much better than BCN, attributing to the improved light absorption, increased CO 2 chemisorption and higher density of photoelectrons.More importantly, the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance over CCN-W is even much better, and the CCN-W sample with optimized W 6 -doping level achieving the highest yields of CO (5.75 mol g -1 h -1 ), CH 4 (4.45 mol g -1 h -1 ) and C 2 H 4 (1.71 mol g -1 h -1 ), totally (11.91mol g -1 h -1 ) being more than 5 times higher than that of CCN, with the yields of CO (1.81 mol g -1 h -1 ), CH 4 (0.24 mol g -1 h -1 ) and C 2 H 4 (0.05 mol g -1 h -1 ).Moreover, as shown in Fig. 8b, the product selectivity of CH 4 (52.59) and C 2 H 4 (30.41) for CCN-W, calculated based on the photoelectrons utilization percentage (see details in Text S1.5), are significantly improved.The overall selectivity of hydrocarbons for CCN-W (83) is more than 2 times higher than that for CCN (41.07).The significantly improved activity and selectivity of CCN-W is ascribed to the multiple synergetic roles of introduced W-N 6 as active centers in gathering photoelectrons and CO 2 reactants, reducing reaction barrier and accelerating reaction efficiency, and stabilizing the CO intermediates moderately.The adsorption of CO intermediate on conventional g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst (BCN) is weak in adsorption strength, CO would be easily escaped from the catalyst surface.On the other hand, although the adsorption capacity and intensity of CO 2 and CO is quite strong on CCN, the photoelectrons cannot be enriched at the same active sites, and the CO hydrogenation is also restrained on CCN.As for CCN-W, the W-N 6 moieties act as active centers favor the adsorption of CO 2 and CO intermediate with moderate strength and coverage, and simultaneously, W-N 6 moieties enrich the photoelectrons, together favoring the yields of CH 4 and C 2 H 4 . In addition, the stability of CCN-W is good enough, it still shows considerable photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance after 5 h illumination, and the yields of the major CO 2 reduction product are almost linearly increased with prolonging light illumination time (Fig. 8c).The basic structures and surface composition of the collected CCN-W after photocatalytic service is also well kept unchanged, which are confirmed by XRD, FTIR and XPS spectra (Fig. S6).The visible light photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performances (Fig. 8d) of CCN-W are also tested under the illumination of solely visible light (420-780 nm) and simulated natural solar light (AM 1.5 G, 200-1100 nm) at otherwise identical operation conditions.In both cases, the CCN-W performs much better, owing to the synergetic modulations in visible light absorption, photoelectron accumulation, CO 2 activation and reactions.Notably, the wavelength-dependent apparent quantum yields (AQE) of the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reactions over CCN-W are determined by utilizing different monochromatic lights (Fig. 8e).The highest AQE (5.10) is achieved at wavelength of 350 nm, and the value of AQE is positively proportional to the wavelength-dependent light absorption capacity, further demonstrating that the present CO 2 reduction processes are dominated by the light absorption and excitation initiated photocatalytic reactions. The reductive conversion of CO 2 involves complex participation of multiple electrons and protons, and the simultaneous breaking and forming of multiple covalent bonds.To disclose the possible CO 2 conversion process during photocatalytic reactions on the CCN-W photocatalyst, the in situ DRIFTS spectra (Fig. 8 , 1500, 1610 and 1642 cm -1 ), formate species (HCOO -, 1370, 1514 and 1578 cm -1 ), and methoxy groups (-OCH 3 , 1445 and 1465 cm -1 ), are detected in the present study 50,52.Before light irradiation, CO 2 -, HCO 53.BCN is characteristic of low degree of crystallinity, low specific surface area, high density of terminal amino groups and weak interlayer interaction (enlarged interlayer distance).The major drawbacks of BCN for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction lie in the following three aspects.First, the light absorption ability of BCN is relatively quite weak, especially in the UV regions (Fig. 5).Second, the CO 2 adsorption capacity is quite low (Fig. 4).Third, the density of available photoelectrons in BCN is low (Fig. 6).All those three aspects can be largely improved in CCN, because of the synergetic effects of reduced density of terminal amino groups, reduced interlayer distance (strengthened interlayer interactions), increased specific surface area, introduced K -doping (interlayer, cave and edge sites) and edge cyano groups.Nevertheless, although CO yield from photocatalytic CO 2 reduction on CCN is largely increased from 0.21 (BCN) to 1.81 (CCN) mol g -1 h -1 , the CO selectivity was almost unchanged.The CO selectivity for CCN is 58.93 based on utilization percentage of photoelectrons (and the CO selectivity is 86.2 based on molar ratio of reduction products), which is comparable to that of BCN.Significantly, by W 6 -doping, CO selectivity can be greatly reduced to 17, while the selectivity of hydrocarbons is increased to 83, being 2 times higher than that of CCN.Moreover, the total yields of CO and hydrocarbons on CCN-W is increased by more than 5 times relative to CCN.Evidently, W 6 -doping and constructing W-N 6 as active centers in highly crystalline g-C 3 N 4 nanorods is essential in improving the CO 2 reduction efficiency and selectivity simultaneously.The multiple synergetic effects (Scheme 2) are elaborated as follows: First, the light absorption.CCN-W basically maintain the strong light harvesting ability as CCN.Relative to CCN, the light absorption capacity of CCN-W is not changed obviously after W 6 -doping, the UV absorption is slightly weakened, while the visible light absorption is slightly enhanced, which shall not be the major reason leading to the great performance improvement.Second, the charge dynamics.CCN-W and CCN have little difference in exciton recombination possibility (Fig. 6a) and exciton dissociation lifetime (Fig. 6b), and CCN-W performs even slightly worse in electron delocalization, because W-N 6 centers can accumulate and store photoelectrons by W 6 /W 5 cycling.The density of photoelectrons in CCN-W is about two times larger than CCN (Fig. 6c) and the charge utilization efficiency is improved by cocatalyst effects of W-N 6 centers, as evidenced by the lower interfacial charge transfer resistance (Fig. 6d) and lower redox reaction barrier (Fig. 7).Third, the CO 2 adsorption.Both CCN-W and CCN have considerable CO 2 and CO Scheme 2. Schematic illustration of the multifunctional role of W-N 6 active centers for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction over CCN-W.adsorption capacity and strength.Relatively, the CO 2 adsorption capacity and intensity are higher in CCN.However, the moderate adsorption affinity of CCN-W is beneficial for CO 2 activation and reaction at lower potential barrier.Finally, the catalytic reactions.Both the photoelectrons and the CO 2 molecules can be enriched at the same W-N 6 active centers in CCN-W, being crucial in promoting the CO 2 reduction efficiency by high collision possibility and low CO 2 reduction reaction barrier (Fig. 7).In contrast, the CO 2 reduction dynamics in CCN would be compromised by random distribution of free photoelectrons.Moreover, the CO 2 reduction selectivity can be improved by in-situ stabilizing the CO intermediate at W-N 6 centers with moderate affinity.Combined together, both the CO 2 reduction efficiency and selectivity of CCN-W can be greatly improved by the multifunctional W-N 6 centers, which synergistically modulate the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction processes."}, {"llm generation": "Liquid", "source": "Fig. 7.
