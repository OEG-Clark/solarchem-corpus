compared to bulk MOF-derived F-NiC and F-Co C samples, sheet MOL-derived L-NiC and L-CoC samples expose much more metal sites, which is expected to promote photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.", "context": "Scheme 1 illustrates the preparation procedures of four kinds of precursors: bulk Ni-MOFs, bulk Co-MOFs, sheet Ni-MOLs, and sheet Co-MOLs.The transition-metal Ni 2 and Co 2 ions are used as the metal sources and BDC is selected as an organic linker.The bulk Ni-MOFs and Co-MOFs are prepared through the conventional solvothermal treatment at 140 C, while the sheet Ni-MOLs and Co-MOLs were prepared by the ultrasonic method. 48,50Subsequently, the as-obtained MOF and MOL precursors are calcined under the same thermal profiles.The calcination temperature of 500 C is determined by TG curves.As shown in Figure S1, the TG curves of the Ni-MOFs and Ni-MOLs show a similar trend that the mass loss becomes much small after the temperature of 500 C.The The freestanding Ni-MOL and Co-MOL nanosheets can be observed in the enlarged TEM images (Figure 2a,d).The thicknesses of Ni-MOLs and Co-MOLs are accurately determined by AFM.As can be seen from Figure 2b, the surface of Ni-MOLs is much smoother.The thickness of two layers is measured to be approximately 2 nm from the height profile (Figure 2c).The thickness of Ni-MOLs is therefore determined to be 1 nm, which is close to the thickness of a single coordination structural layer. 48Besides, the thickness of the sheet Co-MOLs is determined to be 1 nm as well (Figure 2e,f).The AFM results demonstrate that the sheet Ni-MOLs and Co-MOLs with monolayer thicknesses are successfully prepared. Benefiting from the periodic network of MOFs and MOLs, the original structure can be well maintained after hightemperature pyrolysis (Figure 3).As shown in Figure 3a,c, hydrangea-like and prism-like morphologies are observed for the F-NiC and F-CoC samples, respectively.However, the surfaces of the F-NiC and F-CoC samples become coarse as compared to the original MOFs, indicating the collapse of the MOF (Figure 3e,g).TEM images show that the F-NiC and F-CoC samples are constructed by numerous stacked spherical nanoparticles (Figure 3i,k).In contrast, the morphologies of the L-NiC and L-CoC samples are very similar to a piece of paper after pyrolysis of the MOL precursors (Figure 3b,d).As compared to the original MOLs, the disappearance of wrinkles is ascribed to the formation of metallic Ni and Co nanoparticles.The enlarged SEM images show that these nanoparticles are connected with each other, and the layered structure can be clearly observed (Figure 3f,h).TEM images further demonstrate the highly dispersed nanoparticles in the L-NiC and L-CoC samples (Figure 3j,l).As compared to bulk MOF-derived F-NiC and F-Co C samples, sheet MOL-derived L-NiC and L-CoC samples expose much more metal sites, which is expected to promote photocatalytic CO 2 reduction. High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) provides further detailed information.HRTEM images show that the metal nanoparticles of the L-NiC and L-CoC samples are encapsulated in few-layer graphene (Figure 4a,c).The lattice fringes with a spacing of 0.202 nm are assigned to the (111) crystal plane of metallic Ni.The (111) crystal plane of metallic Co with a spacing of 0.204 nm can be also identified (Figure 4c).The diffraction rings in the selected area electron Raman spectra of all samples show the typical D-band (1348 cm -1 ) and G-band (1590 cm -1 ), which are assigned to the defective carbon and graphitic carbon, respectively (Figure 5c,d).The intensity ratio of the D-band and G-band (I D /I G ) is indicative of the degree of graphitization.The value of I D /I G is 1.304 for the F-NiC sample, which is larger than that for the 6c).The peaks located at 853.0 and 870.2 eV are associated with metallic Ni 0 , whereas the peaks centered at 854.9 and 874.4 eV correspond to Ni 2 . 5152253 Similarly, the peaks of metallic Ni 0 , Ni 2 , and the satellite can also be identified in the XPS spectra of the F-Ni C sample (Figure 6d).The presence of Ni 2 species results from the partial oxidation of surface metallic Ni when exposed to air.In addition, the high-resolution XPS spectra of Co 2p of the L-CoC sample are shown in Figure 6e.Two peaks at 778.8 and 794.1 eV are assigned to metallic Co 0 .The characteristic peaks of the oxidized state of Co can be found at 780.9 and 797.1 eV accompanied with two satellite peaks. 54igure 6f shows the similar XPS spectra of Co 2p of the F-CoC sample.The presence of Co 2 peaks indicates the existence of surface oxidized CoO x layers. 40Note that there are no obvious XRD peaks related with these oxidized substances (Figure 5a,b).XRD patterns reflect the information of bulk particles, whereas XPS spectra are used to analyze the surface components.The numbers of the CoO x and NiO x layers may be too small to be detected in the XRD patterns.In addition, the surface CoO x and NiO x layers may be amorphous and have no strong XRD peaks. The high-resolution C 1s spectra (Figure S5a,c) indicate the presence of C-C/CC (284.8 eV), C-O (286.4 eV), and CO (289.7 eV) for the L-NiC and F-NiC samples. 55As shown in Figure S5b,d, the XPS spectra of O 1s of the L-NiC and F-NiC samples can be deconvoluted into three peaks at 529.9, 532.0, and 532.9 eV, corresponding to Ni-O, CO, and C-O, respectively. 49Similarly, Figure S6 shows the highresolution XPS spectra of C 1s and O 1s of the L-CoC and F-CoC samples. The light absorptions of the MOF and MOL precursors and their derived catalysts are evaluated by ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectra (Figure S7).MOFs and MOLs show light absorption at a certain range of wavelength.In contrast, their derived metal/carbon composites have more powerful lightharvesting capability than the original precursors, mainly due to the full-spectrum absorption of carbon. The characterization results collectively demonstrate that the high-temperature pyrolysis treatment of the MOL and MOL precursors can generate Ni and Co nanoparticles encapsulated in a few-layered graphene shell.During the pyrolysis process, Ni 2 and Co 2 cations are reduced to form metallic Ni and Co, respectively.Organic ligands in MOFs and MOLs provide carbon sources for creating ultrathin carbon layers.Benefiting from the periodical arrangement of inorganic cations and organic ligands in MOFs and MOLs, the original architecture can be well maintained after pyrolysis.As compared to the MOF-derived samples, the MOL-derived NiC and CoC nanoparticles are connected with each other like a piece of paper.Therefore, the active metal sites in the MOL-derived samples are more accessible than those in the MOF-derived samples.To highlight the advantage of such special MOLderived NiC and CoC nanoparticles, photocatalytic CO 2 reduction is then performed to evaluate the catalytic activity. The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction uses Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 6H 2 O (abbreviated as Ru, bpy 2,2-bipyridine) as a photosensitizer and an electron donor and triethanolamine (TEOA) as a hole scavenger.As shown in Figure 7a,b, the main reduction products are CO and H 2 .The CO 2 reduction reactions involve multiple electron transfer and produce diverse products.The products from CO 2 reduction can be CO, CH 3 OH, CH 4 , and higher hydrocarbons (Table S1).The final products are usually dependent on the kinetic and thermodynamic factors.For example, the formation of CH 4 and C 2 H 6 is thermodynamically favorable due to the lower potential of the reactions.However, these reactions need 8 and 14 electrons, which is not kinetically favorable.In contrast, both the CO-producing reaction and H 2 -evolving reaction are two-electron reactions.As a result, the CO 2 and H 2 O molecules are reduced into CO and H 2 in this work. As shown in Figure 7a, the F-NiC sample gives a CO production rate of 3660 325 mol g -1 h -1 and a H 2 production rate of 1705 415 mol g -1 h -1 under visiblelight irradiation ( 420 nm).In contrast, the L-NiC sample displays a dramatic increase in the production rate of CO (6025 95 mol g -1 h -1 ) and H 2 (2855 345 mol g -1 h -1 ) under the same reaction conditions.Similarly, the L-CoC sample exhibits the much higher photocatalytic activity of CO 2 reduction than the F-CoC sample (Figure 7b).The yields of CO and H 2 are as high as 7740 573 and 7163 750 mol g -1 h -1 over the L-CoC sample.The catalytic activities of the as-prepared L-NiC and L-CoC composite catalysts are comparable to other state-of-the-art photocatalysts (Table S2).The results demonstrate that the CO 2 molecules can be reduced more efficiently over MOL-derived catalysts than over MOF-derived counterparts. Figure 7c shows the gas generation rates under different photocatalytic reaction conditions.When photocatalysis is performed under an Ar atmosphere rather than CO 2 , it is found that 3030 mol g -1 h -1 of H 2 can be produced, and hardly any CO can be detected.When the CO 2 reduction reaction is conducted in the absence of L-NiC, the CO production rate (225 mol g -1 h -1 ) and H 2 production rate (580 mol g -1 h -1 ) decreased significantly, demonstrating the important role of L-NiC in the photocatalytic process.Furthermore, the catalytic system is almost inactive without the introduction of Ru, light irradiation, or TEOA, suggesting that the CO 2 reduction over L-NiC is a photocatalytic reaction.To ascertain the source of the CO, we perform an isotopic tracing experiment by replacing CO 2 with 13 CO 2 .Also, the reduction products are analyzed by gas chromatographymass spectrometry (GC-MS).A dominant signal is observed at m/z 29, which is attributed to the 13 CO (Figure 7d).The results confirm that CO mainly originates from CO 2 rather than other carbon sources. As we can see in Figure S8, the CO selectivity over the L-NiC and F-NiC samples is slightly higher than that over the L-CoC and F-CoC samples.The possible reasons are discussed.It was reported that the Ni-C bond was shorter than the Co-C bond, suggesting that the binding interaction of Ni with CO 2 was stronger. 48The strong coupling between Ni and CO 2 can be attributed to the high spin state of the Ni in an octahedral coordination. 56Moreover, the adsorption energy of CO 2 on Ni is much stronger than that of Co, indicating the stronger adsorption affinity of NiC toward CO 2 . 48On the other hand, previous studies demonstrated that the H 2 O adsorption energy of Co is stronger than that of Ni. 57 For the L-NiC and F-NiC samples, the weaker H 2 O adsorption energy may make it hard to bind H 2 O molecules and then produce H 2 .In contrast, the L-CoC and F-CoC samples have a stronger H 2 O adsorption energy and can efficiently reduce H 2 O to H 2 .As a result, there is a difference in the CO selectivity between NiC and CoC catalysts. Besides the catalytic activity, the stability is of great importance as well for the recycling of catalysts.It is interestingly found that the as-derived NiC and CoC catalysts show the excellent magnetic property, enabling the facile separation and recycling of catalysts after photocatalysis (Figure 8a,b).The magnetic behaviors of the samples are evaluated by performing the magnetic measurements at 200 K (Figure 8c).The magnetization saturation (Ms) values of the F-NiC, L-NiC, F-CoC, and L-CoC samples are measured to be 30.2,33.6, 135.6, and 142.9 emu g -1 , respectively.The magnetism of the MOL-derived L-NiC and L-CoC are better than the MOF-derived F-NiC and F-CoC, which may be ascribed to the increased exposure of Ni and Co in L-NiC and L-CoC.To evaluate the reusable capacity, we collect the used catalysts and disperse them into fresh reaction solutions.The gas generation rates of CO and H 2 are stable after three repeated experiments (Figure 8d).The structural stability of the L-NiC sample is analyzed.There is no change in the XRD pattern after the photocatalytic reaction (Figure S9).The TEM image of the L-NiC sample after photocatalysis shows the highly dispersive NiC nanoparticles still, and the (111) crystal planes of metallic Ni with an interplanar spacing of 0.202 nm can be identified from the HRTEM image (Figure S10).The above results demonstrate the excellent stability and reusability of the magnetic MOL-derived catalysts. A series of photoelectrochemical tests are conducted to reveal the origin of the better catalytic activities of the L-NiC and L-CoC samples.Photocurrent responses were carried out to assess the transfer efficiency of photogenerated electrons from Ru to metal sites.As shown in Figure 9a,b, the photocurrent-time curves of the L-NiC, L-CoC, F-Ni C, and F-CoC samples show that the photocurrent density increases and returns to the initial value with light turning on and off.MOL-derived L-NiC and L-CoC samples show the greater photocurrent density than MOF-derived F-NiC and F-CoC samples.During tests of photocurrent response, the photogenerated holes can be consumed by the holes' scavenger in the electrolyte, while the photocurrent is formed through the directional migration of photogenerated electrons. 58,59Therefore, it is reasonably concluded that more photoelectrons from Ru are successfully transferred to the L-NiC and L-CoC samples as compared to the F-NiC and F-CoC samples. In addition, photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy is commonly adopted to evaluate the separation of electronhole pairs and their recombination.PL spectra obtained under an excitation wavelength of 520 nm are shown in Figure 9c,d.In the absence of catalysts, the photosensitizer Ru itself displays a strong emission at 608 nm due to a serious recombination of electrons and holes.The introduction of catalysts leads to luminescence quenching.The intensities of emission peaks decrease for all samples, indicating that the carrier recombination is greatly inhibited.Furthermore, the emission peaks of MOL-derived L-NiC and L-CoC samples are weaker than those of MOF-derived F-NiC and F-CoC samples, which is attributed to the more effective charge transfer between Ru and L-NiC (or L-CoC). The EIS Nyquist plots are shown in Figure 9e,f.The L-Ni C and L-CoC samples manifest a smaller semicircle than the F-NiC and F-CoC samples, indicating the lower chargetransfer resistance. 60The EIS results again confirm the faster transfer of charged carriers over MOL-derived L-NiC and L-CoC samples.In addition, MOF and MOL precursors show a much bigger semicircle as compared to their derived metal C catalysts, demonstrating that high-temperature pyrolysis treatment can improve the conductivity. The N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms and CO 2 adsorption isotherms are measured and shown in Figure S11.BET surface areas and CO 2 uptakes of the L-NiC, F-NiC, L-CoC, and F-CoC samples are listed in Table S3.The samples with larger BET surface areas also possess higher CO 2 uptakes.The L-CoC sample with the higher BET surface area and CO 2 uptake exhibits better catalytic activity than the F-CoC sample, indicating the importance of CO 2 adsorption.In contrast, as compared to the F-NiC sample, the gas yields from CO 2 reduction are higher over the L-NiC sample that has the lower BET surface area and CO 2 uptake. derived transition-metal/carbon composites after pyrolysis of Ni-MOFs, Co-MOFs, Ni-MOLs, and Co-MOLs are defined as F-NiC, F-CoC, L-NiC, and L-CoC, respectively.The morphologies of MOFs and MOLs are revealed by SEM and TEM.SEM images of Ni-MOFs and Co-MOFs exhibit the obvious bulk structures, which are constructed by the seriously stacked nanosheets (Figure1a,c).The bulk Ni-MOFs show the hydrangea-like microspheres, while the bulk Co-MOFs show the prism-like irregular particles (FigureS2).The high contrast in the TEM images of Ni-MOFs and Co-MOFs suggests the solid core (Figure1e,g).Most metal sites are therefore confined in the interior of the bulk MOFs.In contrast, SEM images clearly show that the sheet Ni-MOLs and Co-MOLs are composed of highly dispersed nanosheets (Figure1b,d).The presence of wrinkles reflects the high flexibility of the nanosheets.The translucent sheet Ni-MOLs and Co-MOLs under TEM observation indicate their ultrathin thickness (Figure 1f,h).

The results suggest that BET surface areas and CO 2 uptakes may be beneficial to the CO 2 reduction but are not the decisive factors in this work. On the basis of the above results, we propose the photocatalytic mechanism of CO 2 reduction (Figure 10a).Upon the visible light excitation, the photosensitizer Ru-(bpy) 3 2 is converted to the excited state Ru(bpy) 3 2 .The sacrificial electron donor TEOA can quench Ru(bpy) 3 2 to form a reduced photosensitizer Ru(bpy) 3 . 39,61Then, Ru(bpy) 3 will transfer electrons to the active metal sites of NiC and CoC.Finally, the CO 2 molecules that are adsorbed on the active metal sites are reduced to CO; meanwhile, the H 2 O molecules are reduced to H 2 .However, most of active metal sites are confined in the interior due to their bulk structure.It is hard for the reductive electrons from Ru to arrive at the unexposed metal sites (Figure 10b).Thus, most of electrons are recombined with holes again for the MOF-derived F-NiC and F-CoC samples."}], "co-catalyst": [], "light source": [{"llm generation": "UV-vis", "source": "ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectrophotometry (Lambda 950)",

were mixed in a 100 mL beaker.Then, BDC (0.75 mmol) and NiCl 2 6H 2 O (or CoCl 2 6H 2 O, 0.75mmol) were alternately added to the solution.Subsequently, triethylamine (0.8 mL) was quickly injected into the solution.The resulting solution was subjected to ultrasonic treatment for 8 h (40 kHz).The products were collected by centrifugation and washed with ethanol and ultrapure water five times, followed by vacuum freeze-drying. 2.3.Preparation of MOF-Derived F-NiC and F-CoC.F-NiC and F-CoC were obtained through the pyrolysis of Ni-MOFs and Co-MOFs, respectively.The thermal treatment was performed at 500 C in a nitrogen atmosphere for 1 h with a heating rate of 1 C min -1 . 2.4.Preparation of MOL-Derived L-NiC and L-CoC.L-NiC and L-CoC were obtained through the pyrolysis of Ni-MOLs and Co-MOLs, respectively.The thermal treatment was performed at 500 C in a nitrogen atmosphere for 1 h with a heating rate of 1 C min -1 . 2.5.Material Characterization.The samples were characterized by the following techniques: transmission electronic microscopy (JEOL JEM 2100), scanning electron microscopy (Zeiss Sigma 300), atomic force microscopy (Bruker Dimension Edge), X-ray diffraction (RIGAKU-Miniflex II), Raman spectroscopy (Invia Reflex), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (Thermo K-Alpha), thermogravimetric (TG) analysis (Netzsch, STA449C), ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectrophotometry (Lambda 950), and magnetic hysteresis loop (LakeShore7404).Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas and Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) pore size distributions were measured at 77 K on a physisorption system (Micromeritics, ASAP 2020).The CO 2 adsorption isotherms were measured at 273 K on a physisorption system (Micromeritics, ASAP 2020).Photoluminescence spectroscopy was measured in a mixed solution of CH 3 CN (3 mL), H 2 O (2 mL), and TEOA (1 mL) containing Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 6H 2 O (8 mg) and samples (1 mg) on a spectrophotometer (HORIBA, FluoroMax-4). 2.6.Photocatalytic CO 2 Reduction.The photocatalytic CO2 reduction was performed in a quartz reactor.The catalysts (1 mg) and Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 6H 2 O (8 mg) were dispersed in the mixed solvent of CH 3 CN/H 2 O/TEOA 3:2:1 (vol/vol).The reaction system was vacuum degassed and purged with CO 2 three times, alternately.Then, the quartz reactor was purged with CO 2 again for 30 min.The reaction system was irradiated under a 300 W xenon lamp with a 420 nm cutoff filter.The temperature was controlled at 301-303 K by circulating cooling water and heating.The gas products were analyzed by gas chromatography (Agilent 7890B).To confirm the carbon source of CO, the 13 CO 2 isotopic experiment was performed under a 13 CO 2 atmosphere.Then, the gas products were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS, Agilent 7890B and Agilent 5977B MSD). 2.7.Photoelectrochemical Measurements.The photoelectrochemical measurement was performed using a standard threeelectrode quartz cell.Fluorine-doped tin oxide glass that was coated with the photocatalysts (the coating area of 0.5 cm 2 ) served as the working electrodes.Pt and Ag/AgCl were used as counter and reference electrodes, respectively.The transient photocurrent response is measured on an electrochemical analyzer (CH Instruments CHI660E) under irradiation with a xenon lamp.The mixed solvent of CH 3 CN/H 2 O/TEOA containing Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 6H 2 O was used as the electrolyte.Electrochemical impedance spectra was measured on an electrochemical workstation (Princeton PARSTAT MC).The mixed aqueous solution of K 3 Fe(CN) 6 (5 mM), K 4 Fe(CN) 6 (5 mM), and KCl (0.1 mM) was used as the electrolyte."}, {"llm generation": "UV-vis", "source": "The light absorptions of the MOF and MOL precursors and their derived catalysts are evaluated by ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectra (Figure S7).", "context": "Scheme 1 illustrates the preparation procedures of four kinds of precursors: bulk Ni-MOFs, bulk Co-MOFs, sheet Ni-MOLs, and sheet Co-MOLs.The transition-metal Ni 2 and Co 2 ions are used as the metal sources and BDC is selected as an organic linker.The bulk Ni-MOFs and Co-MOFs are prepared through the conventional solvothermal treatment at 140 C, while the sheet Ni-MOLs and Co-MOLs were prepared by the ultrasonic method. 48,50Subsequently, the as-obtained MOF and MOL precursors are calcined under the same thermal profiles.The calcination temperature of 500 C is determined by TG curves.As shown in Figure S1, the TG curves of the Ni-MOFs and Ni-MOLs show a similar trend that the mass loss becomes much small after the temperature of 500 C.The The freestanding Ni-MOL and Co-MOL nanosheets can be observed in the enlarged TEM images (Figure 2a,d).The thicknesses of Ni-MOLs and Co-MOLs are accurately determined by AFM.As can be seen from Figure 2b, the surface of Ni-MOLs is much smoother.The thickness of two layers is measured to be approximately 2 nm from the height profile (Figure 2c).The thickness of Ni-MOLs is therefore determined to be 1 nm, which is close to the thickness of a single coordination structural layer. 48Besides, the thickness of the sheet Co-MOLs is determined to be 1 nm as well (Figure 2e,f).The AFM results demonstrate that the sheet Ni-MOLs and Co-MOLs with monolayer thicknesses are successfully prepared. Benefiting from the periodic network of MOFs and MOLs, the original structure can be well maintained after hightemperature pyrolysis (Figure 3).As shown in Figure 3a,c, hydrangea-like and prism-like morphologies are observed for the F-NiC and F-CoC samples, respectively.However, the surfaces of the F-NiC and F-CoC samples become coarse as compared to the original MOFs, indicating the collapse of the MOF (Figure 3e,g).TEM images show that the F-NiC and F-CoC samples are constructed by numerous stacked spherical nanoparticles (Figure 3i,k).In contrast, the morphologies of the L-NiC and L-CoC samples are very similar to a piece of paper after pyrolysis of the MOL precursors (Figure 3b,d).As compared to the original MOLs, the disappearance of wrinkles is ascribed to the formation of metallic Ni and Co nanoparticles.The enlarged SEM images show that these nanoparticles are connected with each other, and the layered structure can be clearly observed (Figure 3f,h).TEM images further demonstrate the highly dispersed nanoparticles in the L-NiC and L-CoC samples (Figure 3j,l).As compared to bulk MOF-derived F-NiC and F-Co C samples, sheet MOL-derived L-NiC and L-CoC samples expose much more metal sites, which is expected to promote photocatalytic CO 2 reduction. High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) provides further detailed information.HRTEM images show that the metal nanoparticles of the L-NiC and L-CoC samples are encapsulated in few-layer graphene (Figure 4a,c).The lattice fringes with a spacing of 0.202 nm are assigned to the (111) crystal plane of metallic Ni.The (111) crystal plane of metallic Co with a spacing of 0.204 nm can be also identified (Figure 4c).The diffraction rings in the selected area electron Raman spectra of all samples show the typical D-band (1348 cm -1 ) and G-band (1590 cm -1 ), which are assigned to the defective carbon and graphitic carbon, respectively (Figure 5c,d).The intensity ratio of the D-band and G-band (I D /I G ) is indicative of the degree of graphitization.The value of I D /I G is 1.304 for the F-NiC sample, which is larger than that for the 6c).The peaks located at 853.0 and 870.2 eV are associated with metallic Ni 0 , whereas the peaks centered at 854.9 and 874.4 eV correspond to Ni 2 . 5152253 Similarly, the peaks of metallic Ni 0 , Ni 2 , and the satellite can also be identified in the XPS spectra of the F-Ni C sample (Figure 6d).The presence of Ni 2 species results from the partial oxidation of surface metallic Ni when exposed to air.In addition, the high-resolution XPS spectra of Co 2p of the L-CoC sample are shown in Figure 6e.Two peaks at 778.8 and 794.1 eV are assigned to metallic Co 0 .The characteristic peaks of the oxidized state of Co can be found at 780.9 and 797.1 eV accompanied with two satellite peaks. 54igure 6f shows the similar XPS spectra of Co 2p of the F-CoC sample.The presence of Co 2 peaks indicates the existence of surface oxidized CoO x layers. 40Note that there are no obvious XRD peaks related with these oxidized substances (Figure 5a,b).XRD patterns reflect the information of bulk particles, whereas XPS spectra are used to analyze the surface components.The numbers of the CoO x and NiO x layers may be too small to be detected in the XRD patterns.In addition, the surface CoO x and NiO x layers may be amorphous and have no strong XRD peaks. The high-resolution C 1s spectra (Figure S5a,c) indicate the presence of C-C/CC (284.8 eV), C-O (286.4 eV), and CO (289.7 eV) for the L-NiC and F-NiC samples. 55As shown in Figure S5b,d, the XPS spectra of O 1s of the L-NiC and F-NiC samples can be deconvoluted into three peaks at 529.9, 532.0, and 532.9 eV, corresponding to Ni-O, CO, and C-O, respectively. 49Similarly, Figure S6 shows the highresolution XPS spectra of C 1s and O 1s of the L-CoC and F-CoC samples. The light absorptions of the MOF and MOL precursors and their derived catalysts are evaluated by ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectra (Figure S7).MOFs and MOLs show light absorption at a certain range of wavelength.In contrast, their derived metal/carbon composites have more powerful lightharvesting capability than the original precursors, mainly due to the full-spectrum absorption of carbon. The characterization results collectively demonstrate that the high-temperature pyrolysis treatment of the MOL and MOL precursors can generate Ni and Co nanoparticles encapsulated in a few-layered graphene shell.During the pyrolysis process, Ni 2 and Co 2 cations are reduced to form metallic Ni and Co, respectively.Organic ligands in MOFs and MOLs provide carbon sources for creating ultrathin carbon layers.Benefiting from the periodical arrangement of inorganic cations and organic ligands in MOFs and MOLs, the original architecture can be well maintained after pyrolysis.As compared to the MOF-derived samples, the MOL-derived NiC and CoC nanoparticles are connected with each other like a piece of paper.Therefore, the active metal sites in the MOL-derived samples are more accessible than those in the MOF-derived samples.To highlight the advantage of such special MOLderived NiC and CoC nanoparticles, photocatalytic CO 2 reduction is then performed to evaluate the catalytic activity. The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction uses Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 6H 2 O (abbreviated as Ru, bpy 2,2-bipyridine) as a photosensitizer and an electron donor and triethanolamine (TEOA) as a hole scavenger.As shown in Figure 7a,b, the main reduction products are CO and H 2 .The CO 2 reduction reactions involve multiple electron transfer and produce diverse products.The products from CO 2 reduction can be CO, CH 3 OH, CH 4 , and higher hydrocarbons (Table S1).The final products are usually dependent on the kinetic and thermodynamic factors.For example, the formation of CH 4 and C 2 H 6 is thermodynamically favorable due to the lower potential of the reactions.However, these reactions need 8 and 14 electrons, which is not kinetically favorable.In contrast, both the CO-producing reaction and H 2 -evolving reaction are two-electron reactions.As a result, the CO 2 and H 2 O molecules are reduced into CO and H 2 in this work. As shown in Figure 7a, the F-NiC sample gives a CO production rate of 3660 325 mol g -1 h -1 and a H 2 production rate of 1705 415 mol g -1 h -1 under visiblelight irradiation ( 420 nm).In contrast, the L-NiC sample displays a dramatic increase in the production rate of CO (6025 95 mol g -1 h -1 ) and H 2 (2855 345 mol g -1 h -1 ) under the same reaction conditions.Similarly, the L-CoC sample exhibits the much higher photocatalytic activity of CO 2 reduction than the F-CoC sample (Figure 7b).The yields of CO and H 2 are as high as 7740 573 and 7163 750 mol g -1 h -1 over the L-CoC sample.The catalytic activities of the as-prepared L-NiC and L-CoC composite catalysts are comparable to other state-of-the-art photocatalysts (Table S2).The results demonstrate that the CO 2 molecules can be reduced more efficiently over MOL-derived catalysts than over MOF-derived counterparts. Figure 7c shows the gas generation rates under different photocatalytic reaction conditions.When photocatalysis is performed under an Ar atmosphere rather than CO 2 , it is found that 3030 mol g -1 h -1 of H 2 can be produced, and hardly any CO can be detected.When the CO 2 reduction reaction is conducted in the absence of L-NiC, the CO production rate (225 mol g -1 h -1 ) and H 2 production rate (580 mol g -1 h -1 ) decreased significantly, demonstrating the important role of L-NiC in the photocatalytic process.Furthermore, the catalytic system is almost inactive without the introduction of Ru, light irradiation, or TEOA, suggesting that the CO 2 reduction over L-NiC is a photocatalytic reaction.To ascertain the source of the CO, we perform an isotopic tracing experiment by replacing CO 2 with 13 CO 2 .Also, the reduction products are analyzed by gas chromatographymass spectrometry (GC-MS).A dominant signal is observed at m/z 29, which is attributed to the 13 CO (Figure 7d).The results confirm that CO mainly originates from CO 2 rather than other carbon sources. As we can see in Figure S8, the CO selectivity over the L-NiC and F-NiC samples is slightly higher than that over the L-CoC and F-CoC samples.The possible reasons are discussed.It was reported that the Ni-C bond was shorter than the Co-C bond, suggesting that the binding interaction of Ni with CO 2 was stronger. 48The strong coupling between Ni and CO 2 can be attributed to the high spin state of the Ni in an octahedral coordination. 56Moreover, the adsorption energy of CO 2 on Ni is much stronger than that of Co, indicating the stronger adsorption affinity of NiC toward CO 2 . 48On the other hand, previous studies demonstrated that the H 2 O adsorption energy of Co is stronger than that of Ni. 57 For the L-NiC and F-NiC samples, the weaker H 2 O adsorption energy may make it hard to bind H 2 O molecules and then produce H 2 .In contrast, the L-CoC and F-CoC samples have a stronger H 2 O adsorption energy and can efficiently reduce H 2 O to H 2 .As a result, there is a difference in the CO selectivity between NiC and CoC catalysts. Besides the catalytic activity, the stability is of great importance as well for the recycling of catalysts.It is interestingly found that the as-derived NiC and CoC catalysts show the excellent magnetic property, enabling the facile separation and recycling of catalysts after photocatalysis (Figure 8a,b).The magnetic behaviors of the samples are evaluated by performing the magnetic measurements at 200 K (Figure 8c).The magnetization saturation (Ms) values of the F-NiC, L-NiC, F-CoC, and L-CoC samples are measured to be 30.2,33.6, 135.6, and 142.9 emu g -1 , respectively.The magnetism of the MOL-derived L-NiC and L-CoC are better than the MOF-derived F-NiC and F-CoC, which may be ascribed to the increased exposure of Ni and Co in L-NiC and L-CoC.To evaluate the reusable capacity, we collect the used catalysts and disperse them into fresh reaction solutions.The gas generation rates of CO and H 2 are stable after three repeated experiments (Figure 8d).The structural stability of the L-NiC sample is analyzed.There is no change in the XRD pattern after the photocatalytic reaction (Figure S9).The TEM image of the L-NiC sample after photocatalysis shows the highly dispersive NiC nanoparticles still, and the (111) crystal planes of metallic Ni with an interplanar spacing of 0.202 nm can be identified from the HRTEM image (Figure S10).The above results demonstrate the excellent stability and reusability of the magnetic MOL-derived catalysts. A series of photoelectrochemical tests are conducted to reveal the origin of the better catalytic activities of the L-NiC and L-CoC samples.Photocurrent responses were carried out to assess the transfer efficiency of photogenerated electrons from Ru to metal sites.As shown in Figure 9a,b, the photocurrent-time curves of the L-NiC, L-CoC, F-Ni C, and F-CoC samples show that the photocurrent density increases and returns to the initial value with light turning on and off.MOL-derived L-NiC and L-CoC samples show the greater photocurrent density than MOF-derived F-NiC and F-CoC samples.During tests of photocurrent response, the photogenerated holes can be consumed by the holes' scavenger in the electrolyte, while the photocurrent is formed through the directional migration of photogenerated electrons. 58,59Therefore, it is reasonably concluded that more photoelectrons from Ru are successfully transferred to the L-NiC and L-CoC samples as compared to the F-NiC and F-CoC samples. In addition, photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy is commonly adopted to evaluate the separation of electronhole pairs and their recombination.PL spectra obtained under an excitation wavelength of 520 nm are shown in Figure 9c,d.In the absence of catalysts, the photosensitizer Ru itself displays a strong emission at 608 nm due to a serious recombination of electrons and holes.The introduction of catalysts leads to luminescence quenching.The intensities of emission peaks decrease for all samples, indicating that the carrier recombination is greatly inhibited.Furthermore, the emission peaks of MOL-derived L-NiC and L-CoC samples are weaker than those of MOF-derived F-NiC and F-CoC samples, which is attributed to the more effective charge transfer between Ru and L-NiC (or L-CoC). The EIS Nyquist plots are shown in Figure 9e,f.The L-Ni C and L-CoC samples manifest a smaller semicircle than the F-NiC and F-CoC samples, indicating the lower chargetransfer resistance. 60The EIS results again confirm the faster transfer of charged carriers over MOL-derived L-NiC and L-CoC samples.In addition, MOF and MOL precursors show a much bigger semicircle as compared to their derived metal C catalysts, demonstrating that high-temperature pyrolysis treatment can improve the conductivity. The N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms and CO 2 adsorption isotherms are measured and shown in Figure S11.BET surface areas and CO 2 uptakes of the L-NiC, F-NiC, L-CoC, and F-CoC samples are listed in Table S3.The samples with larger BET surface areas also possess higher CO 2 uptakes.The L-CoC sample with the higher BET surface area and CO 2 uptake exhibits better catalytic activity than the F-CoC sample, indicating the importance of CO 2 adsorption.In contrast, as compared to the F-NiC sample, the gas yields from CO 2 reduction are higher over the L-NiC sample that has the lower BET surface area and CO 2 uptake. derived transition-metal/carbon composites after pyrolysis of Ni-MOFs, Co-MOFs, Ni-MOLs, and Co-MOLs are defined as F-NiC, F-CoC, L-NiC, and L-CoC, respectively.The morphologies of MOFs and MOLs are revealed by SEM and TEM.SEM images of Ni-MOFs and Co-MOFs exhibit the obvious bulk structures, which are constructed by the seriously stacked nanosheets (Figure1a,c).The bulk Ni-MOFs show the hydrangea-like microspheres, while the bulk Co-MOFs show the prism-like irregular particles (FigureS2).The high contrast in the TEM images of Ni-MOFs and Co-MOFs suggests the solid core (Figure1e,g).Most metal sites are therefore confined in the interior of the bulk MOFs.In contrast, SEM images clearly show that the sheet Ni-MOLs and Co-MOLs are composed of highly dispersed nanosheets (Figure1b,d).The presence of wrinkles reflects the high flexibility of the nanosheets.The translucent sheet Ni-MOLs and Co-MOLs under TEM observation indicate their ultrathin thickness (Figure 1f,h).

The results suggest that BET surface areas and CO 2 uptakes may be beneficial to the CO 2 reduction but are not the decisive factors in this work. On the basis of the above results, we propose the photocatalytic mechanism of CO 2 reduction (Figure 10a).Upon the visible light excitation, the photosensitizer Ru-(bpy) 3 2 is converted to the excited state Ru(bpy) 3 2 .The sacrificial electron donor TEOA can quench Ru(bpy) 3 2 to form a reduced photosensitizer Ru(bpy) 3 . 39,61Then, Ru(bpy) 3 will transfer electrons to the active metal sites of NiC and CoC.Finally, the CO 2 molecules that are adsorbed on the active metal sites are reduced to CO; meanwhile, the H 2 O molecules are reduced to H 2 .However, most of active metal sites are confined in the interior due to their bulk structure.It is hard for the reductive electrons from Ru to arrive at the unexposed metal sites (Figure 10b).Thus, most of electrons are recombined with holes again for the MOF-derived F-NiC and F-CoC samples."}, {"llm generation": "Visible", "source": "As shown in Figure 7a, the F-NiC sample gives a CO production rate of 3660 325 mol g -1 h -1 and a H 2 production rate of 1705 415 mol g -1 h -1 under visiblelight irradiation ( 420 nm).", "context": "Scheme 1 illustrates the preparation procedures of four kinds of precursors: bulk Ni-MOFs, bulk Co-MOFs, sheet Ni-MOLs, and sheet Co-MOLs.The transition-metal Ni 2 and Co 2 ions are used as the metal sources and BDC is selected as an organic linker.The bulk Ni-MOFs and Co-MOFs are prepared through the conventional solvothermal treatment at 140 C, while the sheet Ni-MOLs and Co-MOLs were prepared by the ultrasonic method. 48,50Subsequently, the as-obtained MOF and MOL precursors are calcined under the same thermal profiles.The calcination temperature of 500 C is determined by TG curves.As shown in Figure S1, the TG curves of the Ni-MOFs and Ni-MOLs show a similar trend that the mass loss becomes much small after the temperature of 500 C.The The freestanding Ni-MOL and Co-MOL nanosheets can be observed in the enlarged TEM images (Figure 2a,d).The thicknesses of Ni-MOLs and Co-MOLs are accurately determined by AFM.As can be seen from Figure 2b, the surface of Ni-MOLs is much smoother.The thickness of two layers is measured to be approximately 2 nm from the height profile (Figure 2c).The thickness of Ni-MOLs is therefore determined to be 1 nm, which is close to the thickness of a single coordination structural layer. 48Besides, the thickness of the sheet Co-MOLs is determined to be 1 nm as well (Figure 2e,f).The AFM results demonstrate that the sheet Ni-MOLs and Co-MOLs with monolayer thicknesses are successfully prepared.

The characterization results collectively demonstrate that the high-temperature pyrolysis treatment of the MOL and MOL precursors can generate Ni and Co nanoparticles encapsulated in a few-layered graphene shell.During the pyrolysis process, Ni 2 and Co 2 cations are reduced to form metallic Ni and Co, respectively.Organic ligands in MOFs and MOLs provide carbon sources for creating ultrathin carbon layers.Benefiting from the periodical arrangement of inorganic cations and organic ligands in MOFs and MOLs, the original architecture can be well maintained after pyrolysis.As compared to the MOF-derived samples, the MOL-derived NiC and CoC nanoparticles are connected with each other like a piece of paper.Therefore, the active metal sites in the MOL-derived samples are more accessible than those in the MOF-derived samples.To highlight the advantage of such special MOLderived NiC and CoC nanoparticles, photocatalytic CO 2 reduction is then performed to evaluate the catalytic activity. The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction uses Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 6H 2 O (abbreviated as Ru, bpy 2,2-bipyridine) as a photosensitizer and an electron donor and triethanolamine (TEOA) as a hole scavenger.As shown in Figure 7a,b, the main reduction products are CO and H 2 .The CO 2 reduction reactions involve multiple electron transfer and produce diverse products.The products from CO 2 reduction can be CO, CH 3 OH, CH 4 , and higher hydrocarbons (Table S1).The final products are usually dependent on the kinetic and thermodynamic factors.For example, the formation of CH 4 and C 2 H 6 is thermodynamically favorable due to the lower potential of the reactions.However, these reactions need 8 and 14 electrons, which is not kinetically favorable.In contrast, both the CO-producing reaction and H 2 -evolving reaction are two-electron reactions.As a result, the CO 2 and H 2 O molecules are reduced into CO and H 2 in this work. As shown in Figure 7a, the F-NiC sample gives a CO production rate of 3660 325 mol g -1 h -1 and a H 2 production rate of 1705 415 mol g -1 h -1 under visiblelight irradiation ( 420 nm).In contrast, the L-NiC sample displays a dramatic increase in the production rate of CO (6025 95 mol g -1 h -1 ) and H 2 (2855 345 mol g -1 h -1 ) under the same reaction conditions.Similarly, the L-CoC sample exhibits the much higher photocatalytic activity of CO 2 reduction than the F-CoC sample (Figure 7b).The yields of CO and H 2 are as high as 7740 573 and 7163 750 mol g -1 h -1 over the L-CoC sample.The catalytic activities of the as-prepared L-NiC and L-CoC composite catalysts are comparable to other state-of-the-art photocatalysts (Table S2).The results demonstrate that the CO 2 molecules can be reduced more efficiently over MOL-derived catalysts than over MOF-derived counterparts. Figure 7c shows the gas generation rates under different photocatalytic reaction conditions.When photocatalysis is performed under an Ar atmosphere rather than CO 2 , it is found that 3030 mol g -1 h -1 of H 2 can be produced, and hardly any CO can be detected.When the CO 2 reduction reaction is conducted in the absence of L-NiC, the CO production rate (225 mol g -1 h -1 ) and H 2 production rate (580 mol g -1 h -1 ) decreased significantly, demonstrating the important role of L-NiC in the photocatalytic process.Furthermore, the catalytic system is almost inactive without the introduction of Ru, light irradiation, or TEOA, suggesting that the CO 2 reduction over L-NiC is a photocatalytic reaction.To ascertain the source of the CO, we perform an isotopic tracing experiment by replacing CO 2 with 13 CO 2 .Also, the reduction products are analyzed by gas chromatographymass spectrometry (GC-MS).A dominant signal is observed at m/z 29, which is attributed to the 13 CO (Figure 7d).The results confirm that CO mainly originates from CO 2 rather than other carbon sources. As we can see in Figure S8, the CO selectivity over the L-NiC and F-NiC samples is slightly higher than that over the L-CoC and F-CoC samples.The possible reasons are discussed.It was reported that the Ni-C bond was shorter than the Co-C bond, suggesting that the binding interaction of Ni with CO 2 was stronger. 48The strong coupling between Ni and CO 2 can be attributed to the high spin state of the Ni in an octahedral coordination. 56Moreover, the adsorption energy of CO 2 on Ni is much stronger than that of Co, indicating the stronger adsorption affinity of NiC toward CO 2 . 48On the other hand, previous studies demonstrated that the H 2 O adsorption energy of Co is stronger than that of Ni. 57 For the L-NiC and F-NiC samples, the weaker H 2 O adsorption energy may make it hard to bind H 2 O molecules and then produce H 2 .In contrast, the L-CoC and F-CoC samples have a stronger H 2 O adsorption energy and can efficiently reduce H 2 O to H 2 .As a result, there is a difference in the CO selectivity between NiC and CoC catalysts. Besides the catalytic activity, the stability is of great importance as well for the recycling of catalysts.It is interestingly found that the as-derived NiC and CoC catalysts show the excellent magnetic property, enabling the facile separation and recycling of catalysts after photocatalysis (Figure 8a,b).The magnetic behaviors of the samples are evaluated by performing the magnetic measurements at 200 K (Figure 8c).The magnetization saturation (Ms) values of the F-NiC, L-NiC, F-CoC, and L-CoC samples are measured to be 30.2,33.6, 135.6, and 142.9 emu g -1 , respectively.The magnetism of the MOL-derived L-NiC and L-CoC are better than the MOF-derived F-NiC and F-CoC, which may be ascribed to the increased exposure of Ni and Co in L-NiC and L-CoC.To evaluate the reusable capacity, we collect the used catalysts and disperse them into fresh reaction solutions.The gas generation rates of CO and H 2 are stable after three repeated experiments (Figure 8d).The structural stability of the L-NiC sample is analyzed.There is no change in the XRD pattern after the photocatalytic reaction (Figure S9).The TEM image of the L-NiC sample after photocatalysis shows the highly dispersive NiC nanoparticles still, and the (111) crystal planes of metallic Ni with an interplanar spacing of 0.202 nm can be identified from the HRTEM image (Figure S10).The above results demonstrate the excellent stability and reusability of the magnetic MOL-derived catalysts. A series of photoelectrochemical tests are conducted to reveal the origin of the better catalytic activities of the L-NiC and L-CoC samples.Photocurrent responses were carried out to assess the transfer efficiency of photogenerated electrons from Ru to metal sites.As shown in Figure 9a,b, the photocurrent-time curves of the L-NiC, L-CoC, F-Ni C, and F-CoC samples show that the photocurrent density increases and returns to the initial value with light turning on and off.MOL-derived L-NiC and L-CoC samples show the greater photocurrent density than MOF-derived F-NiC and F-CoC samples.During tests of photocurrent response, the photogenerated holes can be consumed by the holes' scavenger in the electrolyte, while the photocurrent is formed through the directional migration of photogenerated electrons. 58,59Therefore, it is reasonably concluded that more photoelectrons from Ru are successfully transferred to the L-NiC and L-CoC samples as compared to the F-NiC and F-CoC samples. In addition, photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy is commonly adopted to evaluate the separation of electronhole pairs and their recombination.PL spectra obtained under an excitation wavelength of 520 nm are shown in Figure 9c,d.In the absence of catalysts, the photosensitizer Ru itself displays a strong emission at 608 nm due to a serious recombination of electrons and holes.The introduction of catalysts leads to luminescence quenching.The intensities of emission peaks decrease for all samples, indicating that the carrier recombination is greatly inhibited.Furthermore, the emission peaks of MOL-derived L-NiC and L-CoC samples are weaker than those of MOF-derived F-NiC and F-CoC samples, which is attributed to the more effective charge transfer between Ru and L-NiC (or L-CoC). The EIS Nyquist plots are shown in Figure 9e,f.The L-Ni C and L-CoC samples manifest a smaller semicircle than the F-NiC and F-CoC samples, indicating the lower chargetransfer resistance. 60The EIS results again confirm the faster transfer of charged carriers over MOL-derived L-NiC and L-CoC samples.In addition, MOF and MOL precursors show a much bigger semicircle as compared to their derived metal C catalysts, demonstrating that high-temperature pyrolysis treatment can improve the conductivity. The N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms and CO 2 adsorption isotherms are measured and shown in Figure S11.BET surface areas and CO 2 uptakes of the L-NiC, F-NiC, L-CoC, and F-CoC samples are listed in Table S3.The samples with larger BET surface areas also possess higher CO 2 uptakes.The L-CoC sample with the higher BET surface area and CO 2 uptake exhibits better catalytic activity than the F-CoC sample, indicating the importance of CO 2 adsorption.In contrast, as compared to the F-NiC sample, the gas yields from CO 2 reduction are higher over the L-NiC sample that has the lower BET surface area and CO 2 uptake. derived transition-metal/carbon composites after pyrolysis of Ni-MOFs, Co-MOFs, Ni-MOLs, and Co-MOLs are defined as F-NiC, F-CoC, L-NiC, and L-CoC, respectively.The morphologies of MOFs and MOLs are revealed by SEM and TEM.SEM images of Ni-MOFs and Co-MOFs exhibit the obvious bulk structures, which are constructed by the seriously stacked nanosheets (Figure1a,c).The bulk Ni-MOFs show the hydrangea-like microspheres, while the bulk Co-MOFs show the prism-like irregular particles (FigureS2).The high contrast in the TEM images of Ni-MOFs and Co-MOFs suggests the solid core (Figure1e,g).Most metal sites are therefore confined in the interior of the bulk MOFs.In contrast, SEM images clearly show that the sheet Ni-MOLs and Co-MOLs are composed of highly dispersed nanosheets (Figure1b,d).The presence of wrinkles reflects the high flexibility of the nanosheets.The translucent sheet Ni-MOLs and Co-MOLs under TEM observation indicate their ultrathin thickness (Figure 1f,h).

The results suggest that BET surface areas and CO 2 uptakes may be beneficial to the CO 2 reduction but are not the decisive factors in this work. On the basis of the above results, we propose the photocatalytic mechanism of CO 2 reduction (Figure 10a).Upon the visible light excitation, the photosensitizer Ru-(bpy) 3 2 is converted to the excited state Ru(bpy) 3 2 .The sacrificial electron donor TEOA can quench Ru(bpy) 3 2 to form a reduced photosensitizer Ru(bpy) 3 . 39,61Then, Ru(bpy) 3 will transfer electrons to the active metal sites of NiC and CoC.Finally, the CO 2 molecules that are adsorbed on the active metal sites are reduced to CO; meanwhile, the H 2 O molecules are reduced to H 2 .However, most of active metal sites are confined in the interior due to their bulk structure.It is hard for the reductive electrons from Ru to arrive at the unexposed metal sites (Figure 10b).Thus, most of electrons are recombined with holes again for the MOF-derived F-NiC and F-CoC samples."}], "lamp": [{"llm generation": "Xenon", "source": "The reaction system was irradiated under a 300 W xenon lamp with a 420 nm cutoff filter.",

response, the photogenerated holes can be consumed by the holes' scavenger in the electrolyte, while the photocurrent is formed through the directional migration of photogenerated electrons.", "context": "Scheme 1 illustrates the preparation procedures of four kinds of precursors: bulk Ni-MOFs, bulk Co-MOFs, sheet Ni-MOLs, and sheet Co-MOLs.The transition-metal Ni 2 and Co 2 ions are used as the metal sources and BDC is selected as an organic linker.The bulk Ni-MOFs and Co-MOFs are prepared through the conventional solvothermal treatment at 140 C, while the sheet Ni-MOLs and Co-MOLs were prepared by the ultrasonic method. 48,50Subsequently, the as-obtained MOF and MOL precursors are calcined under the same thermal profiles.The calcination temperature of 500 C is determined by TG curves.As shown in Figure S1, the TG curves of the Ni-MOFs and Ni-MOLs show a similar trend that the mass loss becomes much small after the temperature of 500 C.The The freestanding Ni-MOL and Co-MOL nanosheets can be observed in the enlarged TEM images (Figure 2a,d).The thicknesses of Ni-MOLs and Co-MOLs are accurately determined by AFM.As can be seen from Figure 2b, the surface of Ni-MOLs is much smoother.The thickness of two layers is measured to be approximately 2 nm from the height profile (Figure 2c).The thickness of Ni-MOLs is therefore determined to be 1 nm, which is close to the thickness of a single coordination structural layer. 48Besides, the thickness of the sheet Co-MOLs is determined to be 1 nm as well (Figure 2e,f).The AFM results demonstrate that the sheet Ni-MOLs and Co-MOLs with monolayer thicknesses are successfully prepared. Benefiting from the periodic network of MOFs and MOLs, the original structure can be well maintained after hightemperature pyrolysis (Figure 3).As shown in Figure 3a,c, hydrangea-like and prism-like morphologies are observed for the F-NiC and F-CoC samples, respectively.However, the surfaces of the F-NiC and F-CoC samples become coarse as compared to the original MOFs, indicating the collapse of the MOF (Figure 3e,g).TEM images show that the F-NiC and F-CoC samples are constructed by numerous stacked spherical nanoparticles (Figure 3i,k).In contrast, the morphologies of the L-NiC and L-CoC samples are very similar to a piece of paper after pyrolysis of the MOL precursors (Figure 3b,d).As compared to the original MOLs, the disappearance of wrinkles is ascribed to the formation of metallic Ni and Co nanoparticles.The enlarged SEM images show that these nanoparticles are connected with each other, and the layered structure can be clearly observed (Figure 3f,h).TEM images further demonstrate the highly dispersed nanoparticles in the L-NiC and L-CoC samples (Figure 3j,l).As compared to bulk MOF-derived F-NiC and F-Co C samples, sheet MOL-derived L-NiC and L-CoC samples expose much more metal sites, which is expected to promote photocatalytic CO 2 reduction. High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) provides further detailed information.HRTEM images show that the metal nanoparticles of the L-NiC and L-CoC samples are encapsulated in few-layer graphene (Figure 4a,c).The lattice fringes with a spacing of 0.202 nm are assigned to the (111) crystal plane of metallic Ni.The (111) crystal plane of metallic Co with a spacing of 0.204 nm can be also identified (Figure 4c).The diffraction rings in the selected area electron Raman spectra of all samples show the typical D-band (1348 cm -1 ) and G-band (1590 cm -1 ), which are assigned to the defective carbon and graphitic carbon, respectively (Figure 5c,d).The intensity ratio of the D-band and G-band (I D /I G ) is indicative of the degree of graphitization.The value of I D /I G is 1.304 for the F-NiC sample, which is larger than that for the 6c).The peaks located at 853.0 and 870.2 eV are associated with metallic Ni 0 , whereas the peaks centered at 854.9 and 874.4 eV correspond to Ni 2 . 5152253 Similarly, the peaks of metallic Ni 0 , Ni 2 , and the satellite can also be identified in the XPS spectra of the F-Ni C sample (Figure 6d).The presence of Ni 2 species results from the partial oxidation of surface metallic Ni when exposed to air.In addition, the high-resolution XPS spectra of Co 2p of the L-CoC sample are shown in Figure 6e.Two peaks at 778.8 and 794.1 eV are assigned to metallic Co 0 .The characteristic peaks of the oxidized state of Co can be found at 780.9 and 797.1 eV accompanied with two satellite peaks. 54igure 6f shows the similar XPS spectra of Co 2p of the F-CoC sample.The presence of Co 2 peaks indicates the existence of surface oxidized CoO x layers. 40Note that there are no obvious XRD peaks related with these oxidized substances (Figure 5a,b).XRD patterns reflect the information of bulk particles, whereas XPS spectra are used to analyze the surface components.The numbers of the CoO x and NiO x layers may be too small to be detected in the XRD patterns.In addition, the surface CoO x and NiO x layers may be amorphous and have no strong XRD peaks. The high-resolution C 1s spectra (Figure S5a,c) indicate the presence of C-C/CC (284.8 eV), C-O (286.4 eV), and CO (289.7 eV) for the L-NiC and F-NiC samples. 55As shown in Figure S5b,d, the XPS spectra of O 1s of the L-NiC and F-NiC samples can be deconvoluted into three peaks at 529.9, 532.0, and 532.9 eV, corresponding to Ni-O, CO, and C-O, respectively. 49Similarly, Figure S6 shows the highresolution XPS spectra of C 1s and O 1s of the L-CoC and F-CoC samples. The light absorptions of the MOF and MOL precursors and their derived catalysts are evaluated by ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectra (Figure S7).MOFs and MOLs show light absorption at a certain range of wavelength.In contrast, their derived metal/carbon composites have more powerful lightharvesting capability than the original precursors, mainly due to the full-spectrum absorption of carbon. The characterization results collectively demonstrate that the high-temperature pyrolysis treatment of the MOL and MOL precursors can generate Ni and Co nanoparticles encapsulated in a few-layered graphene shell.During the pyrolysis process, Ni 2 and Co 2 cations are reduced to form metallic Ni and Co, respectively.Organic ligands in MOFs and MOLs provide carbon sources for creating ultrathin carbon layers.Benefiting from the periodical arrangement of inorganic cations and organic ligands in MOFs and MOLs, the original architecture can be well maintained after pyrolysis.As compared to the MOF-derived samples, the MOL-derived NiC and CoC nanoparticles are connected with each other like a piece of paper.Therefore, the active metal sites in the MOL-derived samples are more accessible than those in the MOF-derived samples.To highlight the advantage of such special MOLderived NiC and CoC nanoparticles, photocatalytic CO 2 reduction is then performed to evaluate the catalytic activity. The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction uses Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 6H 2 O (abbreviated as Ru, bpy 2,2-bipyridine) as a photosensitizer and an electron donor and triethanolamine (TEOA) as a hole scavenger.As shown in Figure 7a,b, the main reduction products are CO and H 2 .The CO 2 reduction reactions involve multiple electron transfer and produce diverse products.The products from CO 2 reduction can be CO, CH 3 OH, CH 4 , and higher hydrocarbons (Table S1).The final products are usually dependent on the kinetic and thermodynamic factors.For example, the formation of CH 4 and C 2 H 6 is thermodynamically favorable due to the lower potential of the reactions.However, these reactions need 8 and 14 electrons, which is not kinetically favorable.In contrast, both the CO-producing reaction and H 2 -evolving reaction are two-electron reactions.As a result, the CO 2 and H 2 O molecules are reduced into CO and H 2 in this work. As shown in Figure 7a, the F-NiC sample gives a CO production rate of 3660 325 mol g -1 h -1 and a H 2 production rate of 1705 415 mol g -1 h -1 under visiblelight irradiation ( 420 nm).In contrast, the L-NiC sample displays a dramatic increase in the production rate of CO (6025 95 mol g -1 h -1 ) and H 2 (2855 345 mol g -1 h -1 ) under the same reaction conditions.Similarly, the L-CoC sample exhibits the much higher photocatalytic activity of CO 2 reduction than the F-CoC sample (Figure 7b).The yields of CO and H 2 are as high as 7740 573 and 7163 750 mol g -1 h -1 over the L-CoC sample.The catalytic activities of the as-prepared L-NiC and L-CoC composite catalysts are comparable to other state-of-the-art photocatalysts (Table S2).The results demonstrate that the CO 2 molecules can be reduced more efficiently over MOL-derived catalysts than over MOF-derived counterparts. Figure 7c shows the gas generation rates under different photocatalytic reaction conditions.When photocatalysis is performed under an Ar atmosphere rather than CO 2 , it is found that 3030 mol g -1 h -1 of H 2 can be produced, and hardly any CO can be detected.When the CO 2 reduction reaction is conducted in the absence of L-NiC, the CO production rate (225 mol g -1 h -1 ) and H 2 production rate (580 mol g -1 h -1 ) decreased significantly, demonstrating the important role of L-NiC in the photocatalytic process.Furthermore, the catalytic system is almost inactive without the introduction of Ru, light irradiation, or TEOA, suggesting that the CO 2 reduction over L-NiC is a photocatalytic reaction.To ascertain the source of the CO, we perform an isotopic tracing experiment by replacing CO 2 with 13 CO 2 .Also, the reduction products are analyzed by gas chromatographymass spectrometry (GC-MS).A dominant signal is observed at m/z 29, which is attributed to the 13 CO (Figure 7d).The results confirm that CO mainly originates from CO 2 rather than other carbon sources. As we can see in Figure S8, the CO selectivity over the L-NiC and F-NiC samples is slightly higher than that over the L-CoC and F-CoC samples.The possible reasons are discussed.It was reported that the Ni-C bond was shorter than the Co-C bond, suggesting that the binding interaction of Ni with CO 2 was stronger. 48The strong coupling between Ni and CO 2 can be attributed to the high spin state of the Ni in an octahedral coordination. 56Moreover, the adsorption energy of CO 2 on Ni is much stronger than that of Co, indicating the stronger adsorption affinity of NiC toward CO 2 . 48On the other hand, previous studies demonstrated that the H 2 O adsorption energy of Co is stronger than that of Ni. 57 For the L-NiC and F-NiC samples, the weaker H 2 O adsorption energy may make it hard to bind H 2 O molecules and then produce H 2 .In contrast, the L-CoC and F-CoC samples have a stronger H 2 O adsorption energy and can efficiently reduce H 2 O to H 2 .As a result, there is a difference in the CO selectivity between NiC and CoC catalysts. Besides the catalytic activity, the stability is of great importance as well for the recycling of catalysts.It is interestingly found that the as-derived NiC and CoC catalysts show the excellent magnetic property, enabling the facile separation and recycling of catalysts after photocatalysis (Figure 8a,b).The magnetic behaviors of the samples are evaluated by performing the magnetic measurements at 200 K (Figure 8c).The magnetization saturation (Ms) values of the F-NiC, L-NiC, F-CoC, and L-CoC samples are measured to be 30.2,33.6, 135.6, and 142.9 emu g -1 , respectively.The magnetism of the MOL-derived L-NiC and L-CoC are better than the MOF-derived F-NiC and F-CoC, which may be ascribed to the increased exposure of Ni and Co in L-NiC and L-CoC.To evaluate the reusable capacity, we collect the used catalysts and disperse them into fresh reaction solutions.The gas generation rates of CO and H 2 are stable after three repeated experiments (Figure 8d).The structural stability of the L-NiC sample is analyzed.There is no change in the XRD pattern after the photocatalytic reaction (Figure S9).The TEM image of the L-NiC sample after photocatalysis shows the highly dispersive NiC nanoparticles still, and the (111) crystal planes of metallic Ni with an interplanar spacing of 0.202 nm can be identified from the HRTEM image (Figure S10).The above results demonstrate the excellent stability and reusability of the magnetic MOL-derived catalysts. A series of photoelectrochemical tests are conducted to reveal the origin of the better catalytic activities of the L-NiC and L-CoC samples.Photocurrent responses were carried out to assess the transfer efficiency of photogenerated electrons from Ru to metal sites.As shown in Figure 9a,b, the photocurrent-time curves of the L-NiC, L-CoC, F-Ni C, and F-CoC samples show that the photocurrent density increases and returns to the initial value with light turning on and off.MOL-derived L-NiC and L-CoC samples show the greater photocurrent density than MOF-derived F-NiC and F-CoC samples.During tests of photocurrent response, the photogenerated holes can be consumed by the holes' scavenger in the electrolyte, while the photocurrent is formed through the directional migration of photogenerated electrons. 58,59Therefore, it is reasonably concluded that more photoelectrons from Ru are successfully transferred to the L-NiC and L-CoC samples as compared to the F-NiC and F-CoC samples. In addition, photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy is commonly adopted to evaluate the separation of electronhole pairs and their recombination.PL spectra obtained under an excitation wavelength of 520 nm are shown in Figure 9c,d.In the absence of catalysts, the photosensitizer Ru itself displays a strong emission at 608 nm due to a serious recombination of electrons and holes.The introduction of catalysts leads to luminescence quenching.The intensities of emission peaks decrease for all samples, indicating that the carrier recombination is greatly inhibited.Furthermore, the emission peaks of MOL-derived L-NiC and L-CoC samples are weaker than those of MOF-derived F-NiC and F-CoC samples, which is attributed to the more effective charge transfer between Ru and L-NiC (or L-CoC). The EIS Nyquist plots are shown in Figure 9e,f.The L-Ni C and L-CoC samples manifest a smaller semicircle than the F-NiC and F-CoC samples, indicating the lower chargetransfer resistance. 60The EIS results again confirm the faster transfer of charged carriers over MOL-derived L-NiC and L-CoC samples.In addition, MOF and MOL precursors show a much bigger semicircle as compared to their derived metal C catalysts, demonstrating that high-temperature pyrolysis treatment can improve the conductivity. The N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms and CO 2 adsorption isotherms are measured and shown in Figure S11.BET surface areas and CO 2 uptakes of the L-NiC, F-NiC, L-CoC, and F-CoC samples are listed in Table S3.The samples with larger BET surface areas also possess higher CO 2 uptakes.The L-CoC sample with the higher BET surface area and CO 2 uptake exhibits better catalytic activity than the F-CoC sample, indicating the importance of CO 2 adsorption.In contrast, as compared to the F-NiC sample, the gas yields from CO 2 reduction are higher over the L-NiC sample that has the lower BET surface area and CO 2 uptake. derived transition-metal/carbon composites after pyrolysis of Ni-MOFs, Co-MOFs, Ni-MOLs, and Co-MOLs are defined as F-NiC, F-CoC, L-NiC, and L-CoC, respectively.The morphologies of MOFs and MOLs are revealed by SEM and TEM.SEM images of Ni-MOFs and Co-MOFs exhibit the obvious bulk structures, which are constructed by the seriously stacked nanosheets (Figure1a,c).The bulk Ni-MOFs show the hydrangea-like microspheres, while the bulk Co-MOFs show the prism-like irregular particles (FigureS2).The high contrast in the TEM images of Ni-MOFs and Co-MOFs suggests the solid core (Figure1e,g).Most metal sites are therefore confined in the interior of the bulk MOFs.In contrast, SEM images clearly show that the sheet Ni-MOLs and Co-MOLs are composed of highly dispersed nanosheets (Figure1b,d).The presence of wrinkles reflects the high flexibility of the nanosheets.The translucent sheet Ni-MOLs and Co-MOLs under TEM observation indicate their ultrathin thickness (Figure 1f,h).

The results suggest that BET surface areas and CO 2 uptakes may be beneficial to the CO 2 reduction but are not the decisive factors in this work. On the basis of the above results, we propose the photocatalytic mechanism of CO 2 reduction (Figure 10a).Upon the visible light excitation, the photosensitizer Ru-(bpy) 3 2 is converted to the excited state Ru(bpy) 3 2 .The sacrificial electron donor TEOA can quench Ru(bpy) 3 2 to form a reduced photosensitizer Ru(bpy) 3 . 39,61Then, Ru(bpy) 3 will transfer electrons to the active metal sites of NiC and CoC.Finally, the CO 2 molecules that are adsorbed on the active metal sites are reduced to CO; meanwhile, the H 2 O molecules are reduced to H 2 .However, most of active metal sites are confined in the interior due to their bulk structure.It is hard for the reductive electrons from Ru to arrive at the unexposed metal sites (Figure 10b).Thus, most of electrons are recombined with holes again for the MOF-derived F-NiC and F-CoC samples."}], "reactor type": [], "operation mode": [{"llm generation": "Batch", "source": "The photocatalytic CO2 reduction was performed in a quartz

Co-MOFs) were synthesized through solvothermal treatment. 49Dimethyl formamide (DMF, 32 mL), ethanol (2 mL), and ultrapure water (2 mL) were mixed in a 100 mL beaker.Then, benzene dicarboxylic acid (BDC, 0.75 mmol) and NiCl 2 6H 2 O (or CoCl 2 6H 2 O, 0.75 mmol) were alternately added to the solution.The resulting solution was transferred to a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave, which was sealed and kept at 140 C for 24 h.The products were washed with ethanol and ultrapure water five times, followed by vacuum freeze-drying. 2.2.Preparation of Ni-MOLs and Co-MOLs.Ni-MOLs (or Co-MOLs) were synthesized with the help of ultrasonication.DMF (32 mL), ethanol (2 mL), and ultrapure water (2 mL) were mixed in a 100 mL beaker.Then, BDC (0.75 mmol) and NiCl 2 6H 2 O (or CoCl 2 6H 2 O, 0.75mmol) were alternately added to the solution.Subsequently, triethylamine (0.8 mL) was quickly injected into the solution.The resulting solution was subjected to ultrasonic treatment for 8 h (40 kHz).The products were collected by centrifugation and washed with ethanol and ultrapure water five times, followed by vacuum freeze-drying. 2.3.Preparation of MOF-Derived F-NiC and F-CoC.F-NiC and F-CoC were obtained through the pyrolysis of Ni-MOFs and Co-MOFs, respectively.The thermal treatment was performed at 500 C in a nitrogen atmosphere for 1 h with a heating rate of 1 C min -1 . 2.4.Preparation of MOL-Derived L-NiC and L-CoC.L-NiC and L-CoC were obtained through the pyrolysis of Ni-MOLs and Co-MOLs, respectively.The thermal treatment was performed at 500 C in a nitrogen atmosphere for 1 h with a heating rate of 1 C min -1 . 2.5.Material Characterization.The samples were characterized by the following techniques: transmission electronic microscopy (JEOL JEM 2100), scanning electron microscopy (Zeiss Sigma 300), atomic force microscopy (Bruker Dimension Edge), X-ray diffraction (RIGAKU-Miniflex II), Raman spectroscopy (Invia Reflex), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (Thermo K-Alpha), thermogravimetric (TG) analysis (Netzsch, STA449C), ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectrophotometry (Lambda 950), and magnetic hysteresis loop (LakeShore7404).Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas and Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) pore size distributions were measured at 77 K on a physisorption system (Micromeritics, ASAP 2020).The CO 2 adsorption isotherms were measured at 273 K on a physisorption system (Micromeritics, ASAP 2020).Photoluminescence spectroscopy was measured in a mixed solution of CH 3 CN (3 mL), H 2 O (2 mL), and TEOA (1 mL) containing Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 6H 2 O (8 mg) and samples (1 mg) on a spectrophotometer (HORIBA, FluoroMax-4). 2.6.Photocatalytic CO 2 Reduction.The photocatalytic CO2 reduction was performed in
