The specific surface area (SSA) for pure TiO 2 , after calcination in air at 450 C, is 240 m 2 g -1 and lower values were found for the samples after the deposition of palladium.For Pd/TiO 2 samples, SSA decreased with the noble metal loading.This decrease of surface area could be ascribed to a partial coverage of the TiO 2 surface.The total amount of palladium effectively deposited was determined using XRF.In every case, the real Pd content agrees well with the nominal noble metal content, indicating a good yield of the wet impregnation process under the preparation conditions used. The crystal phase composition and crystallinity of the materials were determined by XRD (Fig. 1).These analyses revealed that anatase was the only crystalline phase of TiO 2 identified in all the samples.No peaks ascribed to the PdO phase were detected for 0.5Pd and 1Pd samples, due to the high dispersion and low metal content present in the materials.Moreover the catalyst with higher palladium content (i.e.1.5 wt) contains also a small peak at about 33attributed to the reflection of PdO. 26 Anatase crystallite sizes of the samples were estimated by the XRD analysis using the Scherrer equation (Table 1). For pristine TiO 2 , the anatase crystallite size was 7 nm and increased to 21-25 nm for Pd/TiO 2 samples. UV-Vis reflectance spectra of the bare TiO 2 sample and Pd/TiO 2 catalysts are shown in Fig. 2. TiO 2 nanoparticles can only absorb light of wavelength shorter than 365 nm (i.e.3.4 eV) because of its wide band gap.After the PdO deposition, the absorption wavelength of the Pd/TiO 2 samples extends to 560 nm (i.e.2.2 eV) and the absorbance increased with the Pd loading as previously observed for the PdO/TiO 2 heterostructure. 27These differences in the absorption properties corresponded to a decrease in equivalent band gap energies of Pd-based photocatalysts with respect to bare TiO 2 , as shown in Table 1. The CH 4 production rate as a function of temperature obtained from the thermo-catalytic reaction is reported in Fig. 3. It is worth noting that bare TiO 2 is not active in the overall temperature range tested.Interestingly, Pd/TiO 2 samples showed some catalytic activities in the thermal reaction.In particular on 0.5Pd and 1.5Pd catalysts, CH 4 production reached the maximum value at 300 and 400 C, respectively. The results are completely different for the sample 1Pd, for which the productivity of CH 4 is negligible up to a temperature of 500 C and then reaches a value equal to about 2.2 mol h -1 g -1 at 600 C.It is very important to note that at 140 C the CH 4 formation rate is almost equal to zero for all the Pd-based samples.During the thermo-catalytic reaction, the formation of CO was also detected with the highest productivity obtained over the 1Pd catalyst at 600 C, as shown in Fig. 4. No other reaction product has been observed. A representative result of photocatalytic tests on Pd/TiO 2 photocatalysts at 140 C is reported in Fig. 5.The photocatalytic tests start feeding in the dark the gaseous reaction mixture to the reactor (t 21 min).In the absence of light, no reaction products were observed.As a consequence no reaction occurs by thermal catalysis under the operating conditions used. When UV-LEDs were switched on, the analysis of the reaction products in the outlet stream disclosed the presence of CH 4 and CO, as detected using the NDIR analyzer. In particular, UV-irradiation of photocatalysts in the fluidized bed reactor led to the evolution of CH 4 as the main product, as well as trace amounts of CO, without evidencing the formation of other products, such as methanol or oxygen.No deactivation phenomena were observed during the irradiation time. When UV light was switched off (t 72 min), CH 4 and CO 2 concentrations decreased to zero.CH 4 should be produced through the following reaction: As indicated above, no formation of O 2 has been observed.The absence of the latter could be explained considering that other organic intermediates, such as methanol, have not been detected.Methanol is a typical compound produced by photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 . 28,29However, noble metals-loaded TiO 2 are also very active in the photocatalytic oxidation of methanol. 30Thus, the simultaneous absence of O 2 and methanol may be due to the oxidation reaction of the alcohol that consumes O 2 . The specific photocatalytic activities for the formation of CH 4 under the steady state conditions are shown in Fig. 6. In the case of 1Pd and 1.5Pd, the CH 4 formation rate was higher than TiO 2 alone, whereas on the 0.5Pd photocatalyst a value very similar to TiO 2 was achieved.A relevant increase in the CH 4 formation rate was found, up to a value of about 64 mol g -1 h -1 , when the Pd loading was equal to 1 wt that is therefore the optimal active phase loading. From the observation of the experimental data reported in Fig. 3 and6, it is possible to observe that for the thermal catalytic reaction on the 1Pd catalyst, CH 4 formation became detectable for temperatures higher than 400 C and its production rate increased with temperature to reach a value of about 3.7 mol h -1 g -1 .In contrast, when the same sample was irradiated with UV light, the CH 4 formation rate was strongly enhanced also at 140 C, reaching a steady state value of 64 mol h -1 g -1 . To explain this different behaviour, one must consider that adsorption of CO 2 on the TiO 2 surface leads to the formation of different surface species.Among these, the most important is the partially negatively charged bent CO 2 form. 31This form of activated CO 2 can be produced on titania even in the absence of irradiation. 32,33The illumination increased the concentration of this form of CO 2 . 32The formation of this kind of CO 2 on titania is attributed to its electronic and defect structures.CO 2 can be activated on oxygen vacancies of the titania structure through an electron transfer from Ti 3 to adsorbed CO 2 , yielding a partially negatively charged species.Irradiation of the TiO 2 surface leads to an enhancement of this charge transfer process.An important observation is that this activation of CO 2 did not lead to the dissociation of CO 2 on TiO 2 . 31n the high activity of titania-supported noble metals, CO 2 is bonded to the surface with both C and O.The carbon atom of the CO 2 is linked to a noble metal atom, while one of the oxygens is bonded to the oxygen vacancy of titania produced by the reduction. 31However, the cleavage of a C-O bond requires energy, as dissociation of CO 2 in the dark was observed previously only at higher temperature. 34,35The fact that illumination greatly promoted the dissociation of CO 2 is very likely due to an extended electron transfer from the solid to the orbital of adsorbed CO 2 .This makes the adsorbed CO 2 more anionic and, hence, the cleavage of the C-O bond is induced. 31The formation of the strongly bonded CO to noble metals may be considered as an additional driving force for easier dissociation of adsorbed CO 2 in the presence of UV light. 31hese observations could explain the higher activity found in the case of photocatalytic reactions. Moreover, to understand the photocatalytic behaviour as a function of Pd loading, it is important to consider that noble metals doped or deposited on TiO 2 are expected to show various effects on the photocatalytic activity of TiO 2 by different mechanisms. 31They could (i) enhance the electronhole separation due to Schottky barrier formation, (ii) extend the light absorption to a visible range and enhance surface electron excitation by plasmon resonances excited by visible light and (iii) modify the surface properties of photocatalysts. 31ased on the results from UV-Vis reflectance spectra (Fig. 2 and Table 1) and from photocatalytic tests (Fig. 6), it can be said that despite the modification of TiO 2 parent support by palladium, which induced a significant decrease of the equivalent band gap energy, in our case the band gap was not the factor contributing to the enhancement of the photocatalytic activity, which instead can be explained considering that the performances of Pd-based photocatalysts generally depend on the concentration of Pd species on the support surface.In fact, according to the literature, the Pd optimum loading was different depending on the investigated degradation reaction, from 2 wt 4 to less than 1 wt. 36n our study, to have the higher CH 4 production, the optimal Pd loading was 1 wt.In this case the CH 4 formation rate was about 64 mol g -1 h -1 .This photoreactivity is significantly higher than that found in the current literature on different catalysts studied for the photoreduction of CO 2 . 5he decrease of photocatalytic activity for the 1.5Pd sample could be attributed to the formed surface PdO clusters (as obtained from XRD analysis) that probably mask the supports surface and thus reduce the light absorption capability of the final catalyst and/or serve as the recombination centres that decrease the photocatalytic performance of Pd photocatalysts. 37"}, {"llm generation": "UV-Vis", "source": "Fig. 2 UV-Vis reflectance spectra of TiO 2 and Pd/TiO 2 catalysts.", "context": "Pd/TiO 2 catalysts were prepared and tested in the steam reduction of CO 2 to methane.Photocatalytic performances were compared to the ones obtained in the thermo-catalytic reaction.The obtained results showed that the \"photocatalytic way\" for this special reaction can more efficiently allow the transformation of CO 2 to CH 4 , giving rise a new promising route to reduce the environmental impact of CO 2 through the transformation into chemical products with high added value.

UV-Vis reflectance spectra of the bare TiO 2 sample and Pd/TiO 2 catalysts are shown in Fig. 2. TiO 2 nanoparticles can only absorb light of wavelength shorter than 365 nm (i.e.3.4 eV) because of its wide band gap.After the PdO deposition, the absorption wavelength of the Pd/TiO 2 samples extends to 560 nm (i.e.2.2 eV) and the absorbance increased with the Pd loading as previously observed for the PdO/TiO 2 heterostructure. 27These differences in the absorption properties corresponded to a decrease in equivalent band gap energies of Pd-based photocatalysts with respect to bare TiO 2 , as shown in Table 1. The CH 4 production rate as a function of temperature obtained from the thermo-catalytic reaction is reported in Fig. 3. It is worth noting that bare TiO 2 is not active in the overall temperature range tested.Interestingly, Pd/TiO 2 samples showed some catalytic activities in the thermal reaction.In particular on 0.5Pd and 1.5Pd catalysts, CH 4 production reached the maximum value at 300 and 400 C, respectively. The results are completely different for the sample 1Pd, for which the productivity of CH 4 is negligible up to a temperature of 500 C and then reaches a value equal to about 2.2 mol h -1 g -1 at 600 C.It is very important to note that at 140 C the CH 4 formation rate is almost equal to zero for all the Pd-based samples.During the thermo-catalytic reaction, the formation of CO was also detected with the highest productivity obtained over the 1Pd catalyst at 600 C, as shown in Fig. 4. No other reaction product has been observed. A representative result of photocatalytic tests on Pd/TiO 2 photocatalysts at 140 C is reported in Fig. 5.The photocatalytic tests start feeding in the dark the gaseous reaction mixture to the reactor (t 21 min).In the absence of light, no reaction products were observed.As a consequence no reaction occurs by thermal catalysis under the operating conditions used.

When UV light was switched off (t 72 min), CH 4 and CO 2 concentrations decreased to zero.CH 4 should be produced through the following reaction: As indicated above, no formation of O 2 has been observed.The absence of the latter could be explained considering that other organic intermediates, such as methanol, have not been detected.Methanol is a typical compound produced by photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 . 28,29However, noble metals-loaded TiO 2 are also very active in the photocatalytic oxidation of methanol. 30Thus, the simultaneous absence of O 2 and methanol may be due to the oxidation reaction of the alcohol that consumes O 2 . The specific photocatalytic activities for the formation of CH 4 under the steady state conditions are shown in Fig. 6. In the case of 1Pd and 1.5Pd, the CH 4 formation rate was higher than TiO 2 alone, whereas on the 0.5Pd photocatalyst a value very similar to TiO 2 was achieved.A relevant increase in the CH 4 formation rate was found, up to a value of about 64 mol g -1 h -1 , when the Pd loading was equal to 1 wt that is therefore the optimal active phase loading. From the observation of the experimental data reported in Fig. 3 and6, it is possible to observe that for the thermal catalytic reaction on the 1Pd catalyst, CH 4 formation became detectable for temperatures higher than 400 C and its production rate increased with temperature to reach a value of about 3.7 mol h -1 g -1 .In contrast, when the same sample was irradiated with UV light, the CH 4 formation rate was strongly enhanced also at 140 C, reaching a steady state value of 64 mol h -1 g -1 . To explain this different behaviour, one must consider that adsorption of CO 2 on the TiO 2 surface leads to the formation of different surface species.Among these, the most important is the partially negatively charged bent CO 2 form. 31This form of activated CO 2 can be produced on titania even in the absence of irradiation. 32,33The illumination increased the concentration of this form of CO 2 . 32The formation of this kind of CO 2 on titania is attributed to its electronic and defect structures.CO 2 can be activated on oxygen vacancies of the titania structure through an electron transfer from Ti 3 to adsorbed CO 2 , yielding a partially negatively charged species.Irradiation of the TiO 2 surface leads to an enhancement of this charge transfer process.An important observation is that this activation of CO 2 did not lead to the dissociation of CO 2 on TiO 2 . 31n the high activity of titania-supported noble metals, CO 2 is bonded to the surface with both C and O.The carbon atom of the CO 2 is linked to a noble metal atom, while one of the oxygens is bonded to the oxygen vacancy of titania produced by the reduction. 31However, the cleavage of a C-O bond requires energy, as dissociation of CO 2 in the dark was observed previously only at higher temperature. 34,35The fact that illumination greatly promoted the dissociation of CO 2 is very likely due to an extended electron transfer from the solid to the orbital of adsorbed CO 2 .This makes the adsorbed CO 2 more anionic and, hence, the cleavage of the C-O bond is induced. 31The formation of the strongly bonded CO to noble metals may be considered as an additional driving force for easier dissociation of adsorbed CO 2 in the presence of UV light. 31hese observations could explain the higher activity found in the case of photocatalytic reactions. Moreover, to understand the photocatalytic behaviour as a function of Pd loading, it is important to consider that noble metals doped or deposited on TiO 2 are expected to show various effects on the photocatalytic activity of TiO 2 by different mechanisms. 31They could (i) enhance the electronhole separation due to Schottky barrier formation, (ii) extend the light absorption to a visible range and enhance surface electron excitation by plasmon resonances excited by visible light and (iii) modify the surface properties of photocatalysts. 31ased on the results from UV-Vis reflectance spectra (Fig. 2 and Table 1) and from photocatalytic tests (Fig. 6), it can be said that despite the modification of TiO 2 parent support by palladium, which induced a significant decrease of the equivalent band gap energy, in our case the band gap was not the factor contributing to the enhancement of the photocatalytic activity, which instead can be explained considering that the performances of Pd-based photocatalysts generally depend on the concentration of Pd species on the support surface.In fact, according to the literature, the Pd optimum loading was different depending on the investigated degradation reaction, from 2 wt 4 to less than 1 wt. 36n our study, to have the higher CH 4 production, the optimal Pd loading was 1 wt.In this case the CH 4 formation rate was about 64 mol g -1 h -1 .This photoreactivity is significantly higher than that found in the current literature on different catalysts studied for the photoreduction of CO 2 . 5he decrease of photocatalytic activity for the 1.5Pd sample could be attributed to the formed surface PdO clusters (as obtained from XRD analysis) that probably mask the supports surface and thus reduce the light absorption capability of the final catalyst and/or serve as the recombination centres that decrease the photocatalytic performance of Pd photocatalysts. 37"}], "reaction medium": [{"llm generation": "Gas", "source": "Steam reduction of CO2 on Pd/TiO2 catalysts: a comparison between thermal and photocatalytic reactions", "context": "Steam reduction of CO2 on Pd/TiO2 catalysts: a comparison between thermal and photocatalytic reactions"}, {"llm generation": "Gas", "source": "Tests were carried out in the range 140-600 C and at atmospheric pressure, feeding 30 (stp)L h -1 He stream containing 1 vol CO 2 , with a H 2 O/CO 2 ratio of 4.", "context": "Pd/TiO 2 samples were prepared by wet impregnation of anatase titania (PC500, Cristal Global Companies) with solutions of tetraamminepalladium nitrate (Aldrich), followed by drying at 120 C and calcination in air at 450 C for 2 hours.The catalysts were named xPd, where x is the nominal metal loading.Photocatalysts were characterized with several techniques.Specific surface areas of catalysts were obtained by N 2 adsorption measurements at -196 C with a Costech Sorptometer 1040 after pretreatment at 150 C for 30 min under He flow (99.9990).UV-Vis reflectance spectra were recorded using a Perkin Elmer spectrometer, Lambda 35.Equivalent band gap determinations were obtained from the Kubelka-Munk function F(R ) by plotting F(R )h 2 vs. h and calculat-ing the x intercept of a line through 0.5 F(R ) 0.8.X-ray diffraction (XRD) was carried out using an X-ray microdiffractometer, Rigaku D-max-RAPID, using Cu-K radiation.Total palladium contents of the samples were determined by X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (XRF) using a ThermoFischer ARL QUANT'X EDXRF spectrometer equipped with a rhodium standard tube as the source of radiation and with a Si-Li drifted crystal detector. A microreactor was employed to evaluate the reactivity of the catalysts in the thermal reaction.The microreactor comprises a 500 mm length, 17 mm I.D. stainless steel tubular flow reactor, heated by an electrical furnace.Catalysts to be tested were diluted with quartz particles to avoid a local rise in temperature during the tests.The diluted mixture was loaded on the reactor.Tests were carried out in the range 140-600 C and at atmospheric pressure, feeding 30 (stp)L h -1 He stream containing 1 vol CO 2 , with a H 2 O/CO 2 ratio of 4.

The specific surface area (SSA) for pure TiO 2 , after calcination in air at 450 C, is 240 m 2 g -1 and lower values were found for the samples after the deposition of palladium.For Pd/TiO 2 samples, SSA decreased with the noble metal loading.This decrease of surface area could be ascribed to a partial coverage of the TiO 2 surface.The total amount of palladium effectively deposited was determined using XRF.In every case, the real Pd content agrees well with the nominal noble metal content, indicating a good yield of the wet impregnation process under the preparation conditions used. The crystal phase composition and crystallinity of the materials were determined by XRD (Fig. 1).These analyses revealed that anatase was the only crystalline phase of TiO 2 identified in all the samples.No peaks ascribed to the PdO phase were detected for 0.5Pd and 1Pd samples, due to the high dispersion and low metal content present in the materials.Moreover the catalyst with higher palladium content (i.e.1.5 wt) contains also a small peak at about 33attributed to the reflection of PdO. 26 Anatase crystallite sizes of the samples were estimated by the XRD analysis using the Scherrer equation (Table 1). For pristine TiO 2 , the anatase crystallite size was 7 nm and increased to 21-25 nm for Pd/TiO 2 samples. UV-Vis reflectance spectra of the bare TiO 2 sample and Pd/TiO 2 catalysts are shown in Fig. 2. TiO 2 nanoparticles can only absorb light of wavelength shorter than 365 nm (i.e.3.4 eV) because of its wide band gap.After the PdO deposition, the absorption wavelength of the Pd/TiO 2 samples extends to 560 nm (i.e.2.2 eV) and the absorbance increased with the Pd loading as previously observed for the PdO/TiO 2 heterostructure. 27These differences in the absorption properties corresponded to a decrease in equivalent band gap energies of Pd-based photocatalysts with respect to bare TiO 2 , as shown in Table 1. The CH 4 production rate as a function of temperature obtained from the thermo-catalytic reaction is reported in Fig. 3. It is worth noting that bare TiO 2 is not active in the overall temperature range tested.Interestingly, Pd/TiO 2 samples showed some catalytic activities in the thermal reaction.In particular on 0.5Pd and 1.5Pd catalysts, CH 4 production reached the maximum value at 300 and 400 C, respectively. The results are completely different for the sample 1Pd, for which the productivity of CH 4 is negligible up to a temperature of 500 C and then reaches a value equal to about 2.2 mol h -1 g -1 at 600 C.It is very important to note that at 140 C the CH 4 formation rate is almost equal to zero for all the Pd-based samples.During the thermo-catalytic reaction, the formation of CO was also detected with the highest productivity obtained over the 1Pd catalyst at 600 C, as shown in Fig. 4. No other reaction product has been observed. A representative result of photocatalytic tests on Pd/TiO 2 photocatalysts at 140 C is reported in Fig. 5.The photocatalytic tests start feeding in the dark the gaseous reaction mixture to the reactor (t 21 min).In the absence of light, no reaction products were observed.As a consequence no reaction occurs by thermal catalysis under the operating conditions used. When UV-LEDs were switched on, the analysis of the reaction products in the outlet stream disclosed the presence of CH 4 and CO, as detected using the NDIR analyzer. In particular, UV-irradiation of photocatalysts in the fluidized bed reactor led to the evolution of CH 4 as the main product, as well as trace amounts of CO, without evidencing the formation of other products, such as methanol or oxygen.No deactivation phenomena were observed during the irradiation time.

In the case of 1Pd and 1.5Pd, the CH 4 formation rate was higher than TiO 2 alone, whereas on the 0.5Pd photocatalyst a value very similar to TiO 2 was achieved.A relevant increase in the CH 4 formation rate was found, up to a value of about 64 mol g -1 h -1 , when the Pd loading was equal to 1 wt that is therefore the optimal active phase loading.

To explain this different behaviour, one must consider that adsorption of CO 2 on the TiO 2 surface leads to the formation of different surface species.Among these, the most important is the partially negatively charged bent CO 2 form. 31This form of activated CO 2 can be produced on titania even in the absence of irradiation. 32,33The illumination increased the concentration of this form of CO 2 . 32The formation of this kind of CO 2 on titania is attributed to its electronic and defect structures.CO 2 can be activated on oxygen vacancies of the titania structure through an electron transfer from Ti 3 to adsorbed CO 2 , yielding a partially negatively charged species.Irradiation of the TiO 2 surface leads to an enhancement of this charge transfer process.An important observation is that this activation of CO 2 did not lead to the dissociation of CO 2 on TiO 2 . 31n the high activity of titania-supported noble metals, CO 2 is bonded to the surface with both C and O.The carbon atom of the CO 2 is linked to a noble metal atom, while one of the oxygens is bonded to the oxygen vacancy of titania produced by the reduction. 31However, the cleavage of a C-O bond requires energy, as dissociation of CO 2 in the dark was observed previously only at higher temperature. 34,35The fact that illumination greatly promoted the dissociation of CO 2 is very likely due to an extended electron transfer from the solid to the orbital of adsorbed CO 2 .This makes the adsorbed CO 2 more anionic and, hence, the cleavage of the C-O bond is induced. 31The formation of the strongly bonded CO to noble metals may be considered as an additional driving force for easier dissociation of adsorbed CO 2 in the presence of UV light. 31hese observations could explain the higher activity found in the case of photocatalytic reactions. Moreover, to understand the photocatalytic behaviour as a function of Pd loading, it is important to consider that noble metals doped or deposited on TiO 2 are expected to show various effects on the photocatalytic activity of TiO 2 by different mechanisms. 31They could (i) enhance the electronhole separation due to Schottky barrier formation, (ii) extend the light absorption to a visible range and enhance surface electron excitation by plasmon resonances excited by visible light and (iii) modify the surface properties of photocatalysts. 31ased on the results from UV-Vis reflectance spectra (Fig. 2 and Table 1) and from photocatalytic tests (Fig. 6), it can be said that despite the modification of TiO 2 parent support by palladium, which induced a significant decrease of the equivalent band gap energy, in our case the band gap was not the factor contributing to the enhancement of the photocatalytic activity, which instead can be explained considering that the performances of Pd-based photocatalysts generally depend on the concentration of Pd species on the support surface.In fact, according to the literature, the Pd optimum loading was different depending on the investigated degradation reaction, from 2 wt 4 to less than 1 wt. 36n our study, to have the higher CH 4 production, the optimal Pd loading was 1 wt.In this case the CH 4 formation rate was about 64 mol g -1 h -1 .This photoreactivity is significantly higher than that found in the current literature on different catalysts studied for the photoreduction of CO 2 . 5he decrease of photocatalytic activity for the 1.5Pd sample could be attributed to the formed surface PdO clusters (as obtained from XRD analysis) that probably mask the supports surface and thus reduce the light absorption capability of the final catalyst and/or serve as the recombination centres that decrease the photocatalytic performance of Pd photocatalysts. 37"}], "operation mode": []}}
