As-fabricated sample was marked as LVO. An in situ reduction was used to fabricate Cu/m-LaVO 4 hollow microspheres.Briefly, a certain amount of Cu(COOCH 3 ) 2 H 2 O and hexadecylamine powders were added into 60 mL ion-exchanged water and stirred for 10 min.Then, 1.0 mmol m-LaVO 4 powders were dispersed in above solution with intensive stirring to form suspensions.Subsequently, appropriate amounts of N 2 H 4 H 2 O aqueous solution (85 wt) was added into above suspensions.After sufficient stirring, the suspensions were poured into a Teflon-lined autoclave (100 mL), which was sealed and placed in a dry oven at 110 C for 6 h.After being cooled in air, the precipitates at the bottom of autoclave were collected after filtering, rinsed thoroughly with absolute ethyl alcohol and ion-exchanged water, and finally dried at 60 C in a vacuum-oven.The Cu/m-LaVO 4 composites prepared with 0.30, 0.60, and 0.90 mmol Cu(COOCH 3 ) 2 H 2 O are marked as Cu/LVO-1, Cu/LVO-2, and Cu/LVO-3, respectively.For comparison, the Cu/m-LaVO 4 composites were also fabricated under identical conditions but in the absence of hexadecylamine.The fabrication process is given in Scheme 1. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of m-LaVO 4 and Cu/m-LaVO 4 samples were collected using a Rigaku D/MAX-2500 X-ray diffractometer with a Cu-K source in rang of 2 14 10-80 .The morphology and detailed structure of as-synthesized samples were investigated with transmission electron microscope (TEM, FEI Tecnai G20) and scanning electron microscope (SEM, HitachiS-4800).The elemental compositions and oxidation states in Cu/m-LaVO 4 composites were analyzed using a VG Microtech MT500 X-ray photoelectron spectrometer with a monochromatic Al K irradiation.The ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of all samples were obtained from a Shimadzu UVA3600 spectrophotometer.CO 2 adsorption capacity and Bru-nauerAEmmettATeller (BET) surface area (S BET ) of m-LaVO 4 and Cu/m-LaVO 4 were determined by a gas adsorption analyzer (Micromeritics ASAP 2020, USA).Photoelectrochemical properties of all samples were investigated with a CHI660E Electrochemical workstation according to the previously reported method 40.A fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate (1 cm 2 in area) coated with samples, Hg/Hg 2 Cl 2 electrode, and Pt wire were employed as the working electrode, reference electrode, and counter electrode, respectively.0.5 M Na 2 SO 4 aqueous solution was used as electrolyte. The experiments of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction were carried out in a homemade cylindrical glass reactor (200 mL in volume) with two openings 6.A 300 W Xe lamp (PLS-SXE300) was used as the simulated sunlight source.The typical experiment is as follows: 100 mg of powders were uniformly dispersed on a quartz disk to form a smooth film.Then the quartz disk was fixed in the middle of the glass reactor.Subsequently, the reactor was evacuated and purged with high purity CO 2 (99.99) for 30 min to obtain an anaerobic condition for the reaction system.Before light irradiation, 0.5 mL H 2 O deionized water was injected to the bottom of the reactor.During the reaction, 0.5 mL of gaseous product was taken out of the glass reactor using a gastight syringe at the predetermined time interval and analyzed by a Ruihong GC-SP7890 gas chromatography equipped with a flame ionized detector (FID).In the process of the reaction, the temperature of the glass reactor was kept at 10 C by cooling the water circulation system."}, {"llm generation": "Cu nanorods", "source": "Due to the formation of a Schottky barrier at the interface between LaVO 4 and Cu, Cu nanorods would act as co-catalyst to accelerate the migration of photoexcited electrons from m-LaVO 4 to Cu, effectively retarding the recombination rate of photogenerated electronhole pairs 35.", "context": "The crystalline structures of bare m-LaVO 4 and Cu/m-LaVO 4 composites were characterized by XRD.Fig. 1a shows the XRD pattern of pure m-LaVO 4 , in which all the diffraction peaks can be assigned to the m-LaVO 4 phase (JCPDS No. 50-0367), and no other impurity peaks can be observed.The XRD patterns of Cu/m-LaVO 4 synthesized with various amounts of Cu precursor were presented in Fig. 1b-d The morphology and microstructure of the pure m-LaVO 4 were observed by SEM and TEM.The SEM image of the pristine m-LaVO 4 in Fig. 2a indicates that the products consist of large microspheres with diameter of 2.0-3.5 m.Some microspheres were interconnected to form dimers.The apparent hole in the surface of microsphere suggests that these microspheres possess a hollow interior structure.The magnified SEM image in Fig. 2b illustrates that their surfaces are much rough, and the wall thickness is about 250 nm.The representative TEM image of a single microsphere was displayed in Fig. 2c.The strong contrast between the dark edge and the grey center further confirms the hollow structure.interior of the dimers.The high-resolution TEM image (Fig. 2d) taken from the edge of the microsphere reveals that the lattice fringes are determined to be 0.297 and 0.340 nm, which matches the (012) and (200) planes of m-LaVO 4 , respectively.The SEM and TEM images of the m-LaVO 4 products with different hydrothermal durations were shown in Fig. S2, suggesting that the microspheres would be formed through a Ostwald ripening process 41,42. Both SEM and TEM were employed to study the morphology and crystal structure of Cu/m-LaVO 4 composites.The SEM image of the sample synthesized with 0.30 mmol Cu precursor were shown in Fig. 3a.It is found that partial surfaces of the hollow microspheres were sparsely covered by some nanorods, which were vertically grown on the surface of microspheres.When the amount of Cu precursor is 0.60 mmol, the surfaces of the microspheres are completely covered by the vertical nanorods (as shown in Fig. 3b).As the amount of Cu precursor is further increased to 0.90 mmol, a layer of nanorods compactly and vertically grew on the surfaces of hollow microspheres, making the microsphere look like a sea-urchin (Fig. 3c andd).Moreover, the nanorods exhibit a remarkable increase in the average diameter and length in comparison with the nanorods in Fig. 3a andb.The TEM image in Fig. 3e also confirms that the surfaces of microspheres were covered by numerous compactly aligned nanorods.It was noted that there are no apparent contrast between the center and the periphery.This may be due to the too dense nanorods on the surface of hollow microspheres.The magnified TEM image obtained from the edge of a microsphere demonstrates that the nanorods with diameter of 10-40 nm were well-aligned, as shown in Fig. 3f.The high-resolution TEM image of the nanordos was presented in the inset of Fig. 3f.The interplanar spacing of 0.21 nm can be ascribed to the (111) facet of Cu, confirming the formation of Cu nanorods on m-LaVO 4 microspheres.The chemical compositions of the Cu/m-LaVO 4 composites were determined by the energy dispersion spectrum (EDS) analysis.As shown in Fig. S3, all the Cu/m-LaVO 4 composites contain Cu, La, V, and O elements.The contents of Cu in Cu/LVO-1, Cu/LVO-2 and Cu/LVO-3 samples are calculated to be 3.41, 11.3 and 23.67 wt.The EDS elemental mapping images in Fig. S4 shows that there is a uniform 1.The S BET increases with increasing the metal Cu content in the Cu/m-LaVO 4 composites.The influence of hexadecylamine in the shape of Cu nanoparticles was also studied.It was found that, in the absence of hexadecylamine, cube-like nanoparticles were formed on the surface of m-LaVO 4 microspheres, as shown in Fig. S5.X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was utilized to analyze the elemental compositions and their oxidation states in the Cu/m-LaVO 4 composites.The survey spectrum of Cu/LVO-2 sample in Fig. 4a reveals the presence of La, V, Cu, O, and C elements.The C element may be attributed to the signal from the adventitious hydrocarbon in the XPS instrument.Fig. 4b displays the high-resolution spectrum of La 3d obtained from Cu/LVO-2 sample.Four characteristic peaks of La 3d were observed.The two peaks located at 834.6 and 838.3 eV can be ascribed to La 3d 5/2 , while the other two peaks at 851.4 and 855.2 eV belong to La 3d 3/2 in m-LaVO 4 25.In the high-resolution V 2p spectrum (Fig. 4c), the peaks located at 516.8 and 524.3 eV can be attributed to the V 2p 3/2 and V 2p 1/2 binding energies of V 5 in m-LaVO 4 43, respectively.The high-resolution Cu 2p spectrum was shown in Fig. 4d.Two strong peaks were observed at binding energies of 932.1 and 952.1 eV, which belongs to the Cu 2p 3/2 and Cu 2p 1/2 of Cu 0 44, respectively.It was reported that the Cu LM2 peak can be employed to confirm the presence of Cu 0 37,45.Fig. 4e shows the Cu LM2 XPS spectrum of Cu/m-LaVO 4 .The broad peak centered at 568.2 eV indicates that Cu really exists in the Cu 0 state in Cu/m-LaVO 4 .It should be noted that the satellite peaks of Cu 2 usually appeared as weak peak at 943.0 and 962.5 eV were not observed, indicating that no CuO compounds exist in the Cu/m-LaVO 4 .The O 1s spectrum of Cu/m-LaVO 4 (Fig. 4f) shows three binding energy peaks at 529.8, 531.5, and 532.9 eV, which may origin from the crystal lattice oxygen and adsorbed oxygen species in Cu/m-LaVO 4 , respectively 46. The light absorption ability and band-gap energy (E g ) of the pure m-LaVO 4 and Cu/m-LaVO 4 products were evaluated using UV-vis DRS spectroscopy in the range of 200-600 nm.As can be seen from Fig. 5A, the absorption edge of pure m-LaVO 4 microspheres is determined to be about 395 nm, indicating that as-prepared m-LaVO 4 microspheres show a weak absorption property for visible-light, which is in agreement with the previous reports in literatures 25.For Cu/m-LaVO 4 composites, the absorption edges are shifted from 395 to 430 nm, and the visible-light harvesting ability is improved with enhancing the metal Cu content, which can be ascribed to the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect of Cu nanorods on m-LaVO 4 microspheres 47.This phenomenon is similar to that observed for Cu/TiO 2 44.The E g values of m-LaVO 4 and Cu/m-LaVO 4 are calculated by applying the formula: h 14 A(hAE g ) n/2 48, where is the absorption coefficient, h is the photo energy, and A is a Plank constant.The value of n is 4 because the m-LaVO 4 is an indirect transition semiconductor 27.Plots of (h) 1/2 versus (h) in Fig. 5B give the extrapolated intercept, which corresponds to the band gap.The E g values for LVO, Cu/LVO-1, Cu/LVO-2, and Cu/LVO-3 are determined to be 3.0, 2.75, 2.54, and 2.68 eV, respectively, indicating that loading Cu nanorods on the surfaces can reduce the E g value of the hollow m-LaVO 4 microspheres.The change of the E g value may be caused by the charge-transfer transition between LaVO 4 and Cu 49. In order to investigate the influence of Cu nanorods in the migration and separation of photoexcited e A -h pairs, transient photocurrent response of m-LaVO 4 and Cu/m-LaVO 4 were recorded.Fig. 6A shows the photocurrent response of m-LaVO conditions.The change of photocurrent density with metal Cu content can be explained as follows: Insufficient metallic Cu in Cu/m-LaVO 4 could not effectively promote the separation of photoexcited e A -h pairs, giving rise to a low photocurrent; On other hand, excessive metal Cu nanorods on m-LaVO 4 would reduce the photocurrent due to the fact that excessive metal Cu would act as a recombination center and facilitate the recombination of photogenerated e A -h 19,21.The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of m-LaVO 4 and Cu/m-LaVO 4 composites are shown in Fig. 6B.It is clearly observed that the arc radius in EIS Nynquist plot of Cu/m-LaVO 4 composites is much smaller than that of pure LaVO 4 .The diameters of the arc radius decrease in the order of Cu/LVO-0 Cu/LVO-1 Cu/LVO-3 Cu/LVO-2.Usually, the smaller arc radius implies the higher charge transfer efficiency of photocatalysts 50.Therefore, the Cu/m-LaVO 4 composites possess a faster interfacial charge migration ability and higher separation efficiency of photogenerated charge pairs as compared to the pure m-LaVO 4 .The enhanced separation efficiency of Cu/m-LaVO 4 composites may result from the accelerated charge-transfer and electron collection caused by the Cu nanorods.The consistent photocurrent and EIS results confirm that the loading Cu nanorods on the surface of m-LaVO 4 microspheres is a feasible approach to improve the separation and transfer efficiencies of photoinduced charge pairs in m-LaVO 4 . The CO 2 adsorption capacities of m-LaVO 4 and Cu/m-LaVO 4 were measured since the CO 2 adsorption behavior of catalysts usually has a great effect on its photocatalytic activity for CO 2 conversion.The CO 2 adsorption isotherms of m-LaVO 4 and Cu/m-LaVO 4 at room temperature are given in Fig. 7A.Generally, the CO 2 adsorption capacities of all samples increase with pressure.In comparison with pure m-LaVO 4 , the Cu/m-LaVO 4 composites exhibit a much larger adsorption capacity.Moreover, the CO 2 adsorption capacity of the Cu/m-LaVO 4 composites shows an increasing trend with enhancing metallic Cu loading.At P/P 0 14 1.0, the CO 2 uptake for LVO, Cu/LVO-1, Cu/LVO-2, and Cu/LVO-3 were determined to be 2.77, 3.61, 4.68, and 5.51 cm 3 /g, respectively.The enhanced adsorption ability of Cu/m-LaVO 4 composites may originate from the relatively big surface area. The photocatalytic CO 2 conversion reactions were conducted in the presence of pure m-LaVO 4 and Cu/m-LaVO 4 composites to get insight into the relationship between the metal Cu content and the photocatalytic performance.Analysis of the product of CO 2 photoreduction using GC revealed that CH 4 is the predominant product.For comparison, contrast experiments were conducted only in the presence of light illumination, catalysts, H 2 O, or CO 2 , in which no CH 4 , H 2 or CO gas were detected.By contrast, in the presence of light illumination, CO 2 , H 2 O and catalysts, CH 4 together with trace amount of CO was obtained, indicating that the photocatalytic CO 2 conversion reactions really happened.The generation rates of CH 4 for m-LaVO 4 and Cu/m-LaVO 4 composites under the same conditions are shown in Fig. 7B.In comparison with pure m-LaVO 4 , the Cu/m-LaVO 4 composites exhibit a higher evolution rate of CH 4 .The ranking order of the photocatalytic activity is Cu/LVO-2 Cu/ LVO-3 Cu/LVO-1 LVO, which is consistent with the former variation trend of photocurrent and EIS.The CH 4 evolution rate for Cu/LVO-2 sample is 4.6 mol/gh, which was about four times that of pristine m-LaVO 4 .This generation rate of CH 4 is similar to that of previously reported Pt/TiO 2 and Pd-Mn/TiO 2 composites utilized for CO 2 photoreduction to CH 4 50,51. Above results demonstrate that the loading Cu nanorods on m-LaVO 4 becomes a crucial factor for improving the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity of m-LaVO 4 .Due to the formation of a Schottky barrier at the interface between LaVO 4 and Cu, Cu nanorods would act as co-catalyst to accelerate the migration of photoexcited electrons from m-LaVO 4 to Cu, effectively retarding the recombination rate of photogenerated electronhole pairs 35.Therefore, with increasing the amount of Cu nanorods till reaching an optimal amount (11.3), the separation efficiency of photoexcited charge pairs was enhanced gradually, resulting in a gradually improved photocatalytic activity of Cu/m-LaVO 4 .In addition to serving as an electron traps, Cu nanorods may also act as the active sites for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction 37,45.In comparison with pure m-LaVO 4 , Cu/m-LaVO 4 composites have bigger surface area and larger active sites to adsorb and activate CO 2 molecules.Moreover, loading Cu nanorods can enhance the visible-light harvesting ability of the catalysts and produce more photoinduced charge pairs, which may also contribute to the effective photocatalytic CO 2 conversion.However, when the loading amount of Cu nanorods was bigger than the optimum value, the photocatalytic activity of Cu/m-LaVO 4 decreased upon increasing the amount of Cu nanorods, though the amount of surface active sites and light harvesting ability of composites still increased.The primary cause for this phenomenon is that enhanced charge-separation efficiency is the major factor affecting the photocatalytic activity of Cu/m-LaVO 4 , and excessive Cu nanorods would act as recombination centers to facilitate the recombination of photoinduced electron-hole pairs, giving rise to an impaired enhancement of photocatalytic activity 37. In order to assess the stability and recyclability of Cu/m-LaVO 4 composites, the repeated CO 2 photoreduction test was carried out for four continuous cycles using Cu/LVO-2 sample as the photocatalysts and the corresponding results were given in Fig. 7C.The photocatalytic activity of Cu/LVO-2 sample enhances slightly with the increase in irradiation time under the identical conditions, confirming the high photostability and recyclability of Cu/m-LaVO 4 composites during photocatalytic reaction.The crystal structure and morphology of Cu/LVO-2 sample after four cycles of photocatalytic reaction were also examined by SEM and XRD, as shown in Fig. S5.Apparently, the morphology and crystal structure of the Cu/m-LaVO 4 composites after the photocatalytic reactions are nearly the same as that of freshly prepared ones.The Cu 2p XPS spectrum of Cu/LVO-2 sample after 16 h irradiation is shown in Fig. S6.A new peak at 964.8 eV is observed and the satellite peaks near 940-950 eV corresponding to CuO become stronger, suggesting the presence of CuO after photocatalytic reactions.The CuO compounds may derive from the photocorrosion process, in which Cu is oxidized by holes 52.However, due to the small content on the Cu surface, no obvious XRD signals of CuO are observed from the XRD pattern of the Cu/LVO-2 sample after four cycles.The surface oxidation of Cu may contribute to the increased photocatalytic activity of Cu/m-LaVO 4 composites 52,53. To further explore the photocatalytic mechanism of Cu/m-LaVO 4 , the band edge positions of m-LaVO 4 was predicted according to the flat-band potential and band-gap of m-LaVO 4 .The Mott-Schottky plots of m-LaVO 4 are presented in Fig. 7D.The positive slope of the plots indicates the ntype semiconductor of pure m-LaVO 4 .The flat-band potential (E fb ) of m-LaVO 4 is determined to be A0.523V vs. Hg/Hg 2 Cl 2 at pH 14 7. The E fb value of m-LaVO 4 was converted into normal hydrogen electrode potential (NHE) via the following equation 20. where E(NHE) is the converted potential, E(Hg/Hg 2 Cl 2 ) is the potential measured against the Hg/Hg 2 Cl 2 electrode, E (Hg/Hg 2 Cl 2 ) is the standard potential of Hg/Hg 2 Cl 2 (0.2415 V), and pH 14 7. Therefore, the conduction band (CB) of m-LaVO 4 is determined to be A0.35V, which is in consistence with the value reported in literatures 24.Combining the E g value of m-LaVO 4 (3.0 eV), the valance band (VB) of m-LaVO 4 can be determined by the equation: where E CB and E VB are the CB potential and VB potential, respectively.The VB is calculated to be 2.65 eV for m-LaVO 4 . Based on above experimental results and analysis, the band edge position of m-LaVO 4 and the charge transfer and separation process are speculated in Fig. 8. Upon light irradiation, m-LaVO 4 was excited to generate e A and h .Because of the more negative CB of m-LaVO 4 (A0.35V) compared to the Fermi level of Cu (A0.26 V) 38,54, the photoexcited e A can easily migrate from m-LaVO 4 to Cu, meanwhile, the h is accumulated in the VB of m-LaVO 4 .The h can directly oxidize H 2 O molecules into oxygen (O 2 ) and protons (H ) 55.Since the redox potential of CO 2 /CH 4 (A0.24V) is lower than the Fermi level of Cu (A0.26 eV), the photogenerated e A accumulated on Cu can effectively reduce the CO 2 into CH 4 by reaction with H .The proposed photocatalytic reaction involved the CO 2 reduction to CH 4 can be described by equations ( 3)- (5)."}, {"llm generation": "Cu nanorods", "source": "This work illuminates that, as a co-catalyst, Cu nanorods can effectively enhance the photocatalytic activity of m-LaVO 4 hollow microspheres, and the Cu/m-LaVO 4 composite microspheres have potential application in CO 2 photoreduction.", "context": "In summary, Cu/m-LaVO 4 composite photocatalysts based on Cu nanorods and m-LaVO 4 hollow microspheres have been successfully synthesized by a simple hydrothermal method and applied for photocatalytic CO 2 conversion.It was demonstrated that Cu nanorods with tunable number density can vertically grow on the surface of m-LaVO 4 hollow microspheres.In comparison with pure m-LaVO 4 , the Cu/m-LaVO 4 composites possess enhanced light harvesting ability, larger surface active cites, higher ability of CO 2 absorption, more efficient chargeseparation, and thus exhibit a remarkably improved photocatalytic performance for CO 2 conversion into CH 4 under the identical conditions.The 11.3 wt Cu/m-LaVO 4 composites showed the highest CO 2 conversion rate of 4.6 mol g A1 h A1 , which is about four times that of pure m-LaVO 4 .This work illuminates that, as a co-catalyst, Cu nanorods can effectively enhance the photocatalytic activity of m-LaVO 4 hollow microspheres, and the Cu/m-LaVO 4 composite microspheres have potential application in CO 2 photoreduction. .

The experiments of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction were carried out in a homemade cylindrical glass reactor (200 mL in volume) with two openings 6.A 300 W Xe lamp (PLS-SXE300) was used as the simulated sunlight source.The typical experiment is as follows: 100 mg of powders were uniformly dispersed on a quartz disk to form a smooth film.Then the quartz disk was fixed in the middle of the glass reactor.Subsequently, the reactor was evacuated and purged with high purity CO 2 (99.99) for 30 min to obtain an anaerobic condition for the reaction system.Before light irradiation, 0.5 mL H 2 O deionized water was injected to the bottom of the reactor.During the reaction, 0.5 mL of gaseous product was taken out of the glass reactor using a gastight syringe at the predetermined time interval and analyzed by a Ruihong GC-SP7890 gas chromatography equipped with a flame ionized detector (FID).In the process of the reaction, the temperature of the glass reactor was kept at 10 C by cooling the water circulation system."}, {"llm generation": "Liquid", "source": "By contrast, in the presence of light illumination, CO 2 , H 2 O and catalysts, CH 4 together with trace amount of CO was obtained, indicating that the photocatalytic CO 2 conversion reactions really happened.", "context": "The crystalline structures of bare m-LaVO 4 and Cu/m-LaVO 4 composites were characterized by XRD.Fig. 1a shows the XRD pattern of pure m-LaVO 4 , in which all the diffraction peaks can be assigned to the m-LaVO 4 phase (JCPDS No. 50-0367), and no other impurity peaks can be observed.The XRD patterns of Cu/m-LaVO 4 synthesized with various amounts of Cu precursor were presented in Fig. 1b-d The morphology and microstructure of the pure m-LaVO 4 were observed by SEM and TEM.The SEM image of the pristine m-LaVO 4 in Fig. 2a indicates that the products consist of large microspheres with diameter of 2.0-3.5 m.Some microspheres were interconnected to form dimers.The apparent hole in the surface of microsphere suggests that these microspheres possess a hollow interior structure.The magnified SEM image in Fig. 2b illustrates that their surfaces are much rough, and the wall thickness is about 250 nm.The representative TEM image of a single microsphere was displayed in Fig. 2c.The strong contrast between the dark edge and the grey center further confirms the hollow structure.interior of the dimers.The high-resolution TEM image (Fig. 2d) taken from the edge of the microsphere reveals that the lattice fringes are determined to be 0.297 and 0.340 nm, which matches the (012) and (200) planes of m-LaVO 4 , respectively.The SEM and TEM images of the m-LaVO 4 products with different hydrothermal durations were shown in Fig. S2, suggesting that the microspheres would be formed through a Ostwald ripening process 41,42. Both SEM and TEM were employed to study the morphology and crystal structure of Cu/m-LaVO 4 composites.The SEM image of the sample synthesized with 0.30 mmol Cu precursor were shown in Fig. 3a.It is found that partial surfaces of the hollow microspheres were sparsely covered by some nanorods, which were vertically grown on the surface of microspheres.When the amount of Cu precursor is 0.60 mmol, the surfaces of the microspheres are completely covered by the vertical nanorods (as shown in Fig. 3b).As the amount of Cu precursor is further increased to 0.90 mmol, a layer of nanorods compactly and vertically grew on the surfaces of hollow microspheres, making the microsphere look like a sea-urchin (Fig. 3c andd).Moreover, the nanorods exhibit a remarkable increase in the average diameter and length in comparison with the nanorods in Fig. 3a andb.The TEM image in Fig. 3e also confirms that the surfaces of microspheres were covered by numerous compactly aligned nanorods.It was noted that there are no apparent contrast between the center and the periphery.This may be due to the too dense nanorods on the surface of hollow microspheres.The magnified TEM image obtained from the edge of a microsphere demonstrates that the nanorods with diameter of 10-40 nm were well-aligned, as shown in Fig. 3f.The high-resolution TEM image of the nanordos was presented in the inset of Fig. 3f.The interplanar spacing of 0.21 nm can be ascribed to the (111) facet of Cu, confirming the formation of Cu nanorods on m-LaVO 4 microspheres.The chemical compositions of the Cu/m-LaVO 4 composites were determined by the energy dispersion spectrum (EDS) analysis.As shown in Fig. S3, all the Cu/m-LaVO 4 composites contain Cu, La, V, and O elements.The contents of Cu in Cu/LVO-1, Cu/LVO-2 and Cu/LVO-3 samples are calculated to be 3.41, 11.3 and 23.67 wt.The EDS elemental mapping images in Fig. S4 shows that there is a uniform 1.The S BET increases with increasing the metal Cu content in the Cu/m-LaVO 4 composites.The influence of hexadecylamine in the shape of Cu nanoparticles was also studied.It was found that, in the absence of hexadecylamine, cube-like nanoparticles were formed on the surface of m-LaVO 4 microspheres, as shown in Fig. S5.X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was utilized to analyze the elemental compositions and their oxidation states in the Cu/m-LaVO 4 composites.The survey spectrum of Cu/LVO-2 sample in Fig. 4a reveals the presence of La, V, Cu, O, and C elements.The C element may be attributed to the signal from the adventitious hydrocarbon in the XPS instrument.Fig. 4b displays the high-resolution spectrum of La 3d obtained from Cu/LVO-2 sample.Four characteristic peaks of La 3d were observed.The two peaks located at 834.6 and 838.3 eV can be ascribed to La 3d 5/2 , while the other two peaks at 851.4 and 855.2 eV belong to La 3d 3/2 in m-LaVO 4 25.In the high-resolution V 2p spectrum (Fig. 4c), the peaks located at 516.8 and 524.3 eV can be attributed to the V 2p 3/2 and V 2p 1/2 binding energies of V 5 in m-LaVO 4 43, respectively.The high-resolution Cu 2p spectrum was shown in Fig. 4d.Two strong peaks were observed at binding energies of 932.1 and 952.1 eV, which belongs to the Cu 2p 3/2 and Cu 2p 1/2 of Cu 0 44, respectively.It was reported that the Cu LM2 peak can be employed to confirm the presence of Cu 0 37,45.Fig. 4e shows the Cu LM2 XPS spectrum of Cu/m-LaVO 4 .The broad peak centered at 568.2 eV indicates that Cu really exists in the Cu 0 state in Cu/m-LaVO 4 .It should be noted that the satellite peaks of Cu 2 usually appeared as weak peak at 943.0 and 962.5 eV were not observed, indicating that no CuO compounds exist in the Cu/m-LaVO 4 .The O 1s spectrum of Cu/m-LaVO 4 (Fig. 4f) shows three binding energy peaks at 529.8, 531.5, and 532.9 eV, which may origin from the crystal lattice oxygen and adsorbed oxygen species in Cu/m-LaVO 4 , respectively 46. The light absorption ability and band-gap energy (E g ) of the pure m-LaVO 4 and Cu/m-LaVO 4 products were evaluated using UV-vis DRS spectroscopy in the range of 200-600 nm.As can be seen from Fig. 5A, the absorption edge of pure m-LaVO 4 microspheres is determined to be about 395 nm, indicating that as-prepared m-LaVO 4 microspheres show a weak absorption property for visible-light, which is in agreement with the previous reports in literatures 25.For Cu/m-LaVO 4 composites, the absorption edges are shifted from 395 to 430 nm, and the visible-light harvesting ability is improved with enhancing the metal Cu content, which can be ascribed to the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect of Cu nanorods on m-LaVO 4 microspheres 47.This phenomenon is similar to that observed for Cu/TiO 2 44.The E g values of m-LaVO 4 and Cu/m-LaVO 4 are calculated by applying the formula: h 14 A(hAE g ) n/2 48, where is the absorption coefficient, h is the photo energy, and A is a Plank constant.The value of n is 4 because the m-LaVO 4 is an indirect transition semiconductor 27.Plots of (h) 1/2 versus (h) in Fig. 5B give the extrapolated intercept, which corresponds to the band gap.The E g values for LVO, Cu/LVO-1, Cu/LVO-2, and Cu/LVO-3 are determined to be 3.0, 2.75, 2.54, and 2.68 eV, respectively, indicating that loading Cu nanorods on the surfaces can reduce the E g value of the hollow m-LaVO 4 microspheres.The change of the E g value may be caused by the charge-transfer transition between LaVO 4 and Cu 49. In order to investigate the influence of Cu nanorods in the migration and separation of photoexcited e A -h pairs, transient photocurrent response of m-LaVO 4 and Cu/m-LaVO 4 were recorded.Fig. 6A shows the photocurrent response of m-LaVO conditions.The change of photocurrent density with metal Cu content can be explained as follows: Insufficient metallic Cu in Cu/m-LaVO 4 could not effectively promote the separation of photoexcited e A -h pairs, giving rise to a low photocurrent; On other hand, excessive metal Cu nanorods on m-LaVO 4 would reduce the photocurrent due to the fact that excessive metal Cu would act as a recombination center and facilitate the recombination of photogenerated e A -h 19,21.The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of m-LaVO 4 and Cu/m-LaVO 4 composites are shown in Fig. 6B.It is clearly observed that the arc radius in EIS Nynquist plot of Cu/m-LaVO 4 composites is much smaller than that of pure LaVO 4 .The diameters of the arc radius decrease in the order of Cu/LVO-0 Cu/LVO-1 Cu/LVO-3 Cu/LVO-2.Usually, the smaller arc radius implies the higher charge transfer efficiency of photocatalysts 50.Therefore, the Cu/m-LaVO 4 composites possess a faster interfacial charge migration ability and higher separation efficiency of photogenerated charge pairs as compared to the pure m-LaVO 4 .The enhanced separation efficiency of Cu/m-LaVO 4 composites may result from the accelerated charge-transfer and electron collection caused by the Cu nanorods.The consistent photocurrent and EIS results confirm that the loading Cu nanorods on the surface of m-LaVO 4 microspheres is a feasible approach to improve the separation and transfer efficiencies of photoinduced charge pairs in m-LaVO 4 . The CO 2 adsorption capacities of m-LaVO 4 and Cu/m-LaVO 4 were measured since the CO 2 adsorption behavior of catalysts usually has a great effect on its photocatalytic activity for CO 2 conversion.The CO 2 adsorption isotherms of m-LaVO 4 and Cu/m-LaVO 4 at room temperature are given in Fig. 7A.Generally, the CO 2 adsorption capacities of all samples increase with pressure.In comparison with pure m-LaVO 4 , the Cu/m-LaVO 4 composites exhibit a much larger adsorption capacity.Moreover, the CO 2 adsorption capacity of the Cu/m-LaVO 4 composites shows an increasing trend with enhancing metallic Cu loading.At P/P 0 14 1.0, the CO 2 uptake for LVO, Cu/LVO-1, Cu/LVO-2, and Cu/LVO-3 were determined to be 2.77, 3.61, 4.68, and 5.51 cm 3 /g, respectively.The enhanced adsorption ability of Cu/m-LaVO 4 composites may originate from the relatively big surface area. The photocatalytic CO 2 conversion reactions were conducted in the presence of pure m-LaVO 4 and Cu/m-LaVO 4 composites to get insight into the relationship between the metal Cu content and the photocatalytic performance.Analysis of the product of CO 2 photoreduction using GC revealed that CH 4 is the predominant product.For comparison, contrast experiments were conducted only in the presence of light illumination, catalysts, H 2 O, or CO 2 , in which no CH 4 , H 2 or CO gas were detected.By contrast, in the presence of light illumination, CO 2 , H 2 O and catalysts, CH 4 together with trace amount of CO was obtained, indicating that the photocatalytic CO 2 conversion reactions really happened.The generation rates of CH 4 for m-LaVO 4 and Cu/m-LaVO 4 composites under the same conditions are shown in Fig. 7B.In comparison with pure m-LaVO 4 , the Cu/m-LaVO 4 composites exhibit a higher evolution rate of CH 4 .The ranking order of the photocatalytic activity is Cu/LVO-2 Cu/ LVO-3 Cu/LVO-1 LVO, which is consistent with the former variation trend of photocurrent and EIS.The CH 4 evolution rate for Cu/LVO-2 sample is 4.6 mol/gh, which was about four times that of pristine m-LaVO 4 .This generation rate of CH 4 is similar to that of previously reported Pt/TiO 2 and Pd-Mn/TiO 2 composites utilized for CO 2 photoreduction to CH 4 50,51. Above results demonstrate that the loading Cu nanorods on m-LaVO 4 becomes a crucial factor for improving the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity of m-LaVO 4 .Due to the formation of a Schottky barrier at the interface between LaVO 4 and Cu, Cu nanorods would act as co-catalyst to accelerate the migration of photoexcited electrons from m-LaVO 4 to Cu, effectively retarding the recombination rate of photogenerated electronhole pairs 35.Therefore, with increasing the amount of Cu nanorods till reaching an optimal amount (11.3), the separation efficiency of photoexcited charge pairs was enhanced gradually, resulting in a gradually improved photocatalytic activity of Cu/m-LaVO 4 .In addition to serving as an electron traps, Cu nanorods may also act as the active sites for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction 37,45.In comparison with pure m-LaVO 4 , Cu/m-LaVO 4 composites have bigger surface area and larger active sites to adsorb and activate CO 2 molecules.Moreover, loading Cu nanorods can enhance the visible-light harvesting ability of the catalysts and produce more photoinduced charge pairs, which may also contribute to the effective photocatalytic CO 2 conversion.However, when the loading amount of Cu nanorods was bigger than the optimum value, the photocatalytic activity of Cu/m-LaVO 4 decreased upon increasing the amount of Cu nanorods, though the amount of surface active sites and light harvesting ability of composites still increased.The primary cause for this phenomenon is that enhanced charge-separation efficiency is the major factor affecting the photocatalytic activity of Cu/m-LaVO 4 , and excessive Cu nanorods would act as recombination centers to facilitate the recombination of photoinduced electron-hole pairs, giving rise to an impaired enhancement of photocatalytic activity 37. In order to assess the stability and recyclability of Cu/m-LaVO 4 composites, the repeated CO 2 photoreduction test was carried out for four continuous cycles using Cu/LVO-2 sample as the photocatalysts and the corresponding results were given in Fig. 7C.The photocatalytic activity of Cu/LVO-2 sample enhances slightly with the increase in irradiation time under the identical conditions, confirming the high photostability and recyclability of Cu/m-LaVO 4 composites during photocatalytic reaction.The crystal structure and morphology of Cu/LVO-2 sample after four cycles of photocatalytic reaction were also examined by SEM and XRD, as shown in Fig. S5.Apparently, the morphology and crystal structure of the Cu/m-LaVO 4 composites after the photocatalytic reactions are nearly the same as that of freshly prepared ones.The Cu 2p XPS spectrum of Cu/LVO-2 sample after 16 h irradiation is shown in Fig. S6.A new peak at 964.8 eV is observed and the satellite peaks near 940-950 eV corresponding to CuO become stronger, suggesting the presence of CuO after photocatalytic reactions.The CuO compounds may derive from the photocorrosion process, in which Cu is oxidized by holes 52.However, due to the small content on the Cu surface, no obvious XRD signals of CuO are observed from the XRD pattern of the Cu/LVO-2 sample after four cycles.The surface oxidation of Cu may contribute to the increased photocatalytic activity of Cu/m-LaVO 4 composites 52,53. To further explore the photocatalytic mechanism of Cu/m-LaVO 4 , the band edge positions of m-LaVO 4 was predicted according to the flat-band potential and band-gap of m-LaVO 4 .The Mott-Schottky plots of m-LaVO 4 are presented in Fig. 7D.The positive slope of the plots indicates the ntype semiconductor of pure m-LaVO 4 .The flat-band potential (E fb ) of m-LaVO 4 is determined to be A0.523V vs. Hg/Hg 2 Cl 2 at pH 14 7. The E fb value of m-LaVO 4 was converted into normal hydrogen electrode potential (NHE) via the following equation 20. where E(NHE) is the converted potential, E(Hg/Hg 2 Cl 2 ) is the potential measured against the Hg/Hg 2 Cl 2 electrode, E (Hg/Hg 2 Cl 2 ) is the standard potential of Hg/Hg 2 Cl 2 (0.2415 V), and pH 14 7. Therefore, the conduction band (CB) of m-LaVO 4 is determined to be A0.35V, which is in consistence with the value reported in literatures 24.Combining the E g value of m-LaVO 4 (3.0 eV), the valance band (VB) of m-LaVO 4 can be determined by the equation: where E CB and E VB are the CB potential and VB potential, respectively.The VB is calculated to be 2.65 eV for m-LaVO 4 . Based on above experimental results and analysis, the band edge position of m-LaVO 4 and the charge transfer and separation process are speculated in Fig. 8. Upon light irradiation, m-LaVO 4 was excited to generate e A and h .Because of the more negative CB of m-LaVO 4 (A0.35V) compared to the Fermi level of Cu (A0.26 V) 38,54, the photoexcited e A can easily migrate from m-LaVO 4 to Cu, meanwhile, the h is accumulated in the VB of m-LaVO 4 .The h can directly oxidize H 2 O molecules into oxygen (O 2 ) and protons (H ) 55.Since the redox potential of CO 2 /CH 4 (A0.24V) is lower than the Fermi level of Cu (A0.26 eV), the photogenerated e A accumulated on Cu can effectively reduce the CO 2 into CH 4 by reaction with H .The proposed photocatalytic reaction involved the CO 2 reduction to CH 4 can be described by equations ( 3)- (5)."}, {"llm generation": "Liquid", "source": "The peaks at 2 14 43.36 and 50.45 correspond to the (111) and (200) planes of Cu phase, respectively, while the remaining peaks are readily assigned to the m-LaVO 4 phase, indicating that Cu 2 in the reaction solution have been reduced to form Cu substance.", "context": "In summary, Cu/m-LaVO 4 composite photocatalysts based on Cu nanorods and m-LaVO 4 hollow microspheres have been successfully synthesized by a simple hydrothermal method and applied for photocatalytic CO 2 conversion.It was demonstrated that Cu nanorods with tunable number density can vertically grow on the surface of m-LaVO 4 hollow microspheres.In comparison with pure m-LaVO 4 , the Cu/m-LaVO 4 composites possess enhanced light harvesting ability, larger surface active cites, higher ability of CO 2 absorption, more efficient chargeseparation, and thus exhibit a remarkably improved photocatalytic performance for CO 2 conversion into CH 4 under the identical conditions.The 11.3 wt Cu/m-LaVO 4 composites showed the highest CO 2 conversion rate of 4.6 mol g A1 h A1 , which is about four times that of pure m-LaVO 4 .This work illuminates that, as a co-catalyst, Cu nanorods can effectively enhance the photocatalytic activity of m-LaVO 4 hollow microspheres, and the Cu/m-LaVO 4 composite microspheres have potential application in CO 2 photoreduction. . Obviously, each XRD pattern shows two kinds of characteristic peaks.The peaks at 2 14 43.36 and 50.45 correspond to the (111) and (200) planes of Cu phase, respectively, while the remaining peaks are readily assigned to the m-LaVO 4 phase, indicating that Cu 2 in the reaction solution have been reduced to form Cu substance.Moreover, the peak positions of m-LaVO 4 in the Cu/m-LaVO 4 composites are almost the same as those of pure m-LaVO 4 , implying that crystal structure of m-LaVO 4 was not affected by metal Cu.It was also demonstrated that the peak intensity of Cu phase gradually becomes stronger with increasing the amount of Cu precursor, suggesting the amount of metallic Cu in the Cu/m-LaVO 4 can be manipulated by adjusting the quantity of Cu precursor in the reaction solution.
