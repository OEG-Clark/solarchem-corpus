The photoreaction was carried out in a closed static system connected to a vacuum line in a similar manner described elsewhere 17.A Rh/TiO 2 sample weighed 0.3 g was spread on the at bottom of a quartz reactor.Before photoreaction, the sample was heated at 673 K for 30 min in the air and evacuated for 30 min at the same temperature, followed by treatment with 8 kPa O 2 for 60 min and evacuation for 30 min at 673 K.After that, the temperature was lowered to 523 K, and the sample was treated with 8 kPa H 2 for 120 min followed by evacuation for 30 min at 523 K.After the above pretreatment, the sample was cooled to room temperature, and a mixture of CO 2 (150 mmol) and H 2 (50 mmol) was admitted to the reactor unless otherwise noted.The total pressure in the reactor was ca. 25 kPa.A 500 W ultrahigh-pressure mercury lamp was used as the light source, and the reactor was illuminated from the bottom.The area subjected to illumination was 12 cm 2 .When the short wavelength part of irradiation light required to be cut-off, a series of glass lters (Toshiba UV-29, UV-37 and Y-45, which permitted 50 transmission of lights at the wavelength 290, 370 and 450 nm, respectively) was placed between the mercury lamp and the reactor.After photoreaction for 6 h, the gaseous products were analyzed.In some cases, after 2 min evacuation at room temperature following to the photoreaction, the sample was heated at 573 K for 20 min, and the desorbed gases were also analyzed.To avoid the reaction between desorbed gases, they were trapped by the adsorption to a high surface area SiO 2 kept at 77 K.The analysis of products was performed with an on-line TCD gas chromatograph (Shimadzu GC-8A) equipped with Molecular Sieve 5A packed column using argon as a carrier gas, which could detect H 2 , CH 4 , and CO. X-ray absorption (XAS) experiments were carried out on the beam line BL-10B at Photon Factory in the High Energy Accelerator Research Organization, Tsukuba, Japan (proposal no.93G170).All spectra were recorded using an in situ cell in a transmission mode at room temperature with an Si(3 1 1) two-crystal channel-cut monochromator. Data analysis was performed using a FACOM M1800 computer of Kyoto University Data Processing Center.Normalization of XANES spectra and data reduction of EXAFS were carried out as described elsewhere 18. We tried to reduce CO 2 by H 2 on Rh(1)/TiO 2 under photoirradiation.After 6 h irradiation, 9.2 mmol of CO and a small amount (0.1 mmol) of CH 4 were produced.Any other products such as hydrocarbons or oxygenates were not detected.The activity was very high compared to those reported by us previously using the same reaction system with ZrO 2 samples 19,20.When only CO 2 was introduced and no H 2 was admitted to the reactor, no product was detected even after photoirradiation.On the contrary, when only H 2 (i.e., no CO 2 ) was introduced, the evolution of CH 4 was observed.This indicates that there are some carbon residues on the Rh/TiO 2 sample.However, the amount of CH 4 was too small (0.05 mmol).From these results, we concluded that the CO obtained here comes from CO 2 , and that this reaction is a reduction of CO 2 by H 2 . The dependence of the reaction on the wavelength of irradiation light was investigated by cutting off a part of the wavelength region of the irradiation light by a series of optical glass lters.Apparently, the activity towards CO production decreased when the irradiation light was ltered on the longer wavelength as shown in Fig. 1.Since the temperature of the reactor was not so different from each other between the case with or without any optical lters, the change in the activity observed here may be due to the change in the wavelength of light rather than in the heat supplied by irradiated light.This result leads us to the conclusion that some photochemical processes are included in this reaction.However, it is not a pure photoreaction because signicant amount of CO was produced even when no irradiation was supplied with the reactor slightly temperature-elevated in the water bath (323 K).The amount of CO production in the dark was larger than that with a glass lter cutting !370 nm or !450 nm.This is not surprising considering that the temperature of the reactor was lower than 323 K under photoirradiation.From these results, we claim that the CO 2 reduction by H 2 on Rh/TiO 2 is a photoenhanced reaction similar to the concept suggested with Ru loaded TiO 2 12,13.Fig. 2 shows the time course of CO production over Rh(1)/TiO 2 under continuous photoirradiation.In the earlier stage of photoreaction, the amount of CO naturally increased with time; however, the increase stopped about 10 h after the photoirradiation started.On the contrary, the decrease in the amount of CO which ought to be once produced was observed.Along with the decrease of CO, the increase of CH 4 production was indeed observed, but the amount of produced CH 4 was far smaller than that of CO decrease.For this reason we cannot assume that CO is converted to CH 4 by hydrogenation during the long irradiation.As a consequence, it must be hypothesized that the Rh/ TiO 2 absorbed the CO.Detailed discussion will be found in the following section. As described in Section 2, the Rh/TiO 2 sample was reduced by H 2 at 523 K after the oxidization by O 2 at 673 K as a pretreatment before photoreactions.We investigated the effect of H 2 reduction of the Rh/TiO 2 sample in the pretreatment by varying the temperature of H 2 treatment on the Rh(1)/TiO 2 .The result is shown in Fig. 3. From this, we can notice that the increase in the reduction temperature above 523 K brings about the drastic decrease in the activity towards CO production.On the other hand, CH 4 production slightly increases when the reduction temperature increases.It suggests that the oxidation state of Rh in Rh(1)/TiO 2 sample controls the selectivity of CO 2 H 2 photoreaction as well as the activity of the reaction.In a word, it seems that when Rh remains oxidized in a proper degree, the activity towards CO production is high.However, when no H 2 treatment was given (i.e., Rh was in a fully oxidized state), the activity was very low either towards CO or CH 4 production: the amount of yielded CO and CH 4 were only 0.2 and 0.1 mmol, respectively.From this, the following ideas are implied: (1) when Rh in Rh/TiO 2 is moderately reduced, the Rh/TiO 2 sample shows the highest activity towards CO production, and (2) as Rh in Rh/TiO 2 is reduced excessively, the product selectivity shifts from CO to CH 4 along with the decrease in the activity. We investigated the effect of the loading amount of Rh on the reaction activity and selectivity with the temperature of H 2 reduction treatment xed to 523 K. Fig. 4 shows the amount of yielded CO and CH 4 over Rh/TiO 2 samples with various amounts of Rh loading after 6 h irradiation.The increase in Rh loading resulted in the decrease in CO evolution.When the amount of Rh increased, thermodynamically preferable CH 4 was yielded rather than CO, although the absolute amount of CH 4 evolution was small.The effect of an increase in the loading amount of Rh seems similar to that of the reductions at higher temperature than 523 K on Rh(1)/TiO 2 .From this, it is assumed that the variation of the loading amount causes the change of the state of Rh on TiO 2 .When the amount of Rh loading is low, Rh may be in a moderately reduced state on the surface of TiO 2 and assist to produce CO. To clarify the assumption mentioned above, we recorded the Rh K-edge X-ray absorption spectra and elucidated the state of Rh on various Rh(X)/TiO 2 (X0.54) samples after pretreatment.Fig. 5(A) shows the Rh K-edge XANES spectra of Rh/ TiO 2 sample with various amounts of Rh loading together with those of Rh foil and Rh 2 O 3 as references.Looking at the series of the spectra, we can see that the shape of the spectrum of Rh(4)/TiO 2 is similar to that of Rh foil, and that the shape of the spectra changes gradually to that of rhodium oxide with the increase of loaded Rh. There have been reports concerning that the XANES spectrum of a sample containing an element in a mixture of different states can be simulated by the linear combination of the spectra of reference compounds corresponding to each oxidation state 21,22.So we also tried to reproduce the XANES spectra of the Rh/TiO 2 samples by the superposition of the spectra of reference compounds with a suitable ratio.Fig. 6 shows the original XANES spectra of the samples with the simulated ones using Rh 2 O 3 and Rh foil as reference compounds.This clearly indicates that the increase in the Rh loading is responsible for the growth of Rh in a metallic state.It is also shown that even the Rh(0.5)/TiO 2 sample contains 35 of metal. On the other hand, Fourier-transforms of k 3 -weighted Rh K-edge EXAFS spectra of the Rh/TiO 2 samples and reference compounds mentioned above are shown in Fig. 5(B).While the peak at around 2.4 A E assigned to metallic RhRh bond is very weak in Rh(0.5)/TiO 2 , it is enhanced together with the increase in the amount of loaded Rh.The peak at around 1.6 A E is assigned to RhO bond, and the intensity of the peak decreases as the amount of Rh increases.The sample richest in Rh, Rh(4)/TiO 2 , shows almost no peak at around 1.6 A E . From the above-mentioned results obtained by the XAS experiments, we concluded that the highly active sample for the CO 2 H 2 photoreaction keeps Rh in a state of the mixture of metal and oxide.The state of Rh involves the selectivity of products also: the more the Rh is reduced, the more is CH 4 produced rather than CO.The former notion is again very similar to that proposed by Thampi et al. 12,13 with Ru/ TiO 2 sample. As described above, the reaction between CO 2 and H 2 over Rh/TiO 2 is enhanced by irradiation.We suppose that the light is absorbed by TiO 2 rather than Rh because no reaction proceeded when Rh/SiO 2 is used instead of Rh/ TiO 2 .Probably the light generates a pair of an excited electron and a positive hole in TiO 2 .The electron moves to Rh to be injected into CO 2 adsorbed on Rh, and the CO 2 is activated to become CO A 2 .This process has been proposed in the literature 15.On the other hand, H 2 is adsorbed on Rh dissociatively, and the dissociated hydrogen may migrate onto TiO 2 surface to react with the positive hole.This process results in the formation of H , which may be bound with an oxygen of TiO 2 to form surface hydroxyl group.In such a way the charge will be separated effectively. As the possibility of the evolution of CO from CO A 2 , the following reaction has been proposed on K-promoted Rh metal surface 23: That is, the disproportionation reaction of two CO A 2 anion radicals into CO and carbonate.As the carbonate species will exist in a stable form on TiO 2 surface, the migration of CO 2A 3 species to TiO 2 surface will further help the above disproportionation reaction. However, it should be kept in mind that there is a possibility of the CO production via any intermediate such as a formate ion.The CO A 2 radical is thought to be more reactive with hydrogen than a neutral CO 2 , and the most plausible product in the rst step of CO 2 hydrogenation is the formate ion.The formation of the formate ion from CO 2 and H 2 in a thermal reaction on supported Rh has already been reported 24.The formate is known to decompose rather easily to yield CO. Since the evolution of CO was practically observed on Rh/TiO 2 under irradiation using formic acid together with H 2 as a reactant, we guess that this mechanism is preferable to that explained from the disproportionation of CO A 2 radical. We have found that when Rh is in a partially reduced state, Rh/TiO 2 shows a high activity in the reaction between CO 2 and H 2 to yield CO. On the contrary, when Rh is reduced to a metallic state, the activity is low and the main product is not CO but CH 4 .This phenomenon can be expressed from the differences in the ability of H 2 dissociation.When Rh is in a partially reduced state, the H 2 dissociation ability of the Rh is suppressed at a suitable degree.When Rh is fully reduced to a metallic state, the H 2 dissociation ability is too strong, and the dissociated hydrogen not only accepts the positive hole but also reacts with negatively charged CO A 2 to hydrogenate it.If the hydrogenation of CO A 2 is completed, the product CH 4 will be released to the gas phase; however, it is suggested that the CO A 2 is not easily hydrogenated to CH 4 but remains on the surface as a form of CH x , because when Rh is fully reduced, the amount of CH 4 is small while the evolution of CO remarkably decreases.This excessive hydrogenation reaction cannot proceed via CO as an intermediate because CO and H 2 did not react on Rh/TiO 2 under irradiation at room temperature. According to the above view, however, the difference of Ru and Rh in the selectivity in CO 2 H 2 reaction cannot be explained.In addition, one cannot illustrate the reason why the highly reduced Ru/TiO 2 does not exhibit higher activity in CH 4 production than partially reduced one.From this, it should be concluded that the oxide state plays an important role as a promoter in some steps of the reaction.Although it is not clear in which step the oxide state works effectively, it may assist the redox reaction between CO 2 and H 2 by changing its oxidation state. Fig. 1 shows the result of CO 2 H 2 reaction under irradiation of several parts of wavelengths, as well as in the dark.It is noteworthy that CO is yielded as a main product of CO 2 reduction even in the dark.CO is an unreasonable product considering the thermodynamic equilibrium of the reverse water-gas shift reaction CO 2 g H 2 g 3 CO g H 2 O gY AG 28X6 kJamol at 298X15 K at room temperature (or at 323 K).This contradiction indicates the removal of one (or two) product(s) which causes the shift of the equilibrium to the right. It is thought that the surface of TiO 2 is highly dehydrated after the evacuation at high temperature in the pretreatment.Hence, signicant amount of surface hydroxyl group can be produced newly on TiO 2 .As H 2 directly forms surface hydroxyl group during the CO 2 H 2 reaction according to the reaction mechanism we proposed in the previous section, it is thought that H 2 O need not be released into the gas phase in the dark reaction for a while. The amount of CO increased from 3.4 to 5.1 mmol when the reaction time was extended from 6 to 24 h in the dark at 323 K.However, the reaction rate is small compared to the case under irradiation.Therefore we have claimed that the reaction is a photo-enhanced reaction'' as Thampi et al. 12,13 previously declared.It should be noted that the dark reactions were performed at 323 K.This temperature is rather higher than the temperature of the reaction system under irradiation.Hence, the amount of CO produced in the dark may be less than 3.4 mmol for 6 h reaction.When the Y-45 optical lter was put to use (i.e., the light with wavelength longer than 450 nm was irradiated), the amount of CO was only 1.4 mmol even under irradiation, although the tempera-ture of the reactor was not very different from each other under irradiation using any optical lter.Thus the value of 1.4 mmol is to be considered as the contribution of the CO evolution by the dark reaction under photoirradiation, since the light with wavelength longer than 450 nm does not contribute to the excitation of TiO 2 .From this, the amount of CO by pure photoreaction should be 7.8 mmol for 6 h reaction, because the total amount of evolved CO is 9.2 mmol and the amount of CO produced by the dark reaction is 1.4 mmol.Therefore, the ratio of the production of CO by the dark reaction to that of the photoreaction under irradiation without any lter is calculated to be only 18. As depicted in Fig. 2, we can understand that CO is once yielded at the earlier stage of the reaction, but removed from the gas phase afterwards.It suggests that CO is adsorbed to Rh/TiO 2 or converted to other compounds.Between these two possibilities, the former one (i.e., simple adsorption process) should be excluded.If the adsorption was the main reason, a part of produced CO might have immediately been adsorbed on Rh/TiO 2 after its production, and the other part might have been released to the gas phase since the rate of CO adsorption was thought to be enough fast.Therefore the amount of CO might increase monotonously.In practice, however, the amount of CO in the gas phase decreased after reaching the maximum amount.Hence the simple adsorption should not be the reason of this peculiar behavior.This leads us to the conclusion that CO is converted to other compounds during the long period of reaction. Many investigators have reported that Rh forms rhodium carbonyl clusters under CO atmosphere 25.Considering that, we prospected the formation of Rh m (CO) n species during the photoreaction because in later part of the photoreaction the Rh/TiO 2 sample is surrounded with gaseous CO produced in the reaction.The conversion of Rh into Rh m (CO) n species can also be the reason of the decrease in the activity towards CO production.Accordingly, the rapid decrease of gaseous CO after long time irradiation can be successfully explained: the rapid decrease of CO is brought about both by the reaction between Rh and CO, and by the decline of the production of CO. The formation of Rh m (CO) n is supported by the desorbed gases by heat treatment at 573 K after photoreaction.The main component of the desorbed gases by heat treatment was CO.This indicates that more amount of CO exists on the surface of Rh/TiO 2 , although it is not clear in which form they exist on the surface.However, taking it into consideration that the Rh m (CO) n species was decomposed at temperature up to ca. 573 K 26, the carbonyl cluster is one of the candidates of the compounds formed during photoreaction on the surface.Furthermore, the XANES spectrum of Rh/TiO 2 also suggests the change of the state of Rh before and after photoreaction.The XANES spectra of Rh(1)/TiO 2 and Rh(4)/TiO 2 after photoreaction and their simulation spectra using those of reference compounds are shown in Fig. 7.A good tting result was achieved in the case of Rh(4)/TiO 2 (Fig. 7(a)), while in Rh(1)/TiO 2 the tting with the spectra of Rh foil and Rh 2 O 3 as the reference compounds did not get along well.Taking into account that the spectrum of Rh(1)/ TiO 2 before photoreaction could be t with those of the reference compounds, we concluded that another chemical species than a metal or an oxide formed on Rh(1)/TiO 2 during the photoreaction.It is supposed that the other species is the compound made of Rh and CO.Therefore, we tried to simulate the XANES of Rh(1)/TiO 2 after photoreaction using the spectrum of Rh(CO) 2 Cl 2 along with Rh foil and Rh 2 O 3 .The result was a little better than that without Rh(CO) 2 Cl 2 as shown in Fig. 7(b).This suggests the formation of rhodium carbonyl compounds in a sense.However, we should not establish the existence of the compounds simply because of the success in the simulation of XANES spectrum by Rh(CO) 2 Cl 2 .It is only a reinforcement of the hypothesis and the speculation. The above results are, of course, not enough for the evidences pointing out that rhodium carbonyl compounds form on Rh/TiO 2 .However, it is certain that the compound to which CO is converted does not relate to the reaction path of CO 2 photoreduction by H 2 : the compound is yielded after the production of CO from CO 2 and H 2 .Therefore, if we can remove CO from the reactor by some chemical engineering methods, the photoreaction possibly proceeds continuously because the change in the state of Rh can be avoided. Rh-loading TiO 2 is found to show high activity towards photoreduction of CO 2 by H 2 under mild condition of low pressure and room temperature.When Rh on TiO 2 is in a mixture of metal and oxide, the high activity towards CO 2 photoreduction by H 2 to CO is observed.When Rh is fully reduced, the activity is drastically lowered in addition to the change of the main product from CO to CH 4 .This change can be explained by the suppression in the H 2 dissociation ability by Rh in an oxide state as well as the effect of the oxide state as a promoter.The deactivation of the sample and the decrease of once produced CO during a long period of reaction are both illustrated from the formation of rhodium carbonyl compounds from Rh and CO.

The dependence of the reaction on the wavelength of irradiation light was investigated by cutting off a part of the wavelength region of the irradiation light by a series of optical glass lters.Apparently, the activity towards CO production decreased when the irradiation light was ltered on the longer wavelength as shown in Fig. 1.Since the temperature of the reactor was not so different from each other between the case with or without any optical lters, the change in the activity observed here may be due to the change in the wavelength of light rather than in the heat supplied by irradiated light.This result leads us to the conclusion that some photochemical processes are included in this reaction.However, it is not a pure photoreaction because signicant amount of CO was produced even when no irradiation was supplied with the reactor slightly temperature-elevated in the water bath (323 K).The amount of CO production in the dark was larger than that with a glass lter cutting !370 nm or !450 nm.This is not surprising considering that the temperature of the reactor was lower than 323 K under photoirradiation.From these results, we claim that the CO 2 reduction by H 2 on Rh/TiO 2 is a photoenhanced reaction similar to the concept suggested with Ru loaded TiO 2 12,13.Fig. 2 shows the time course of CO production over Rh(1)/TiO 2 under continuous photoirradiation.In the earlier stage of photoreaction, the amount of CO naturally increased with time; however, the increase stopped about 10 h after the photoirradiation started.On the contrary, the decrease in the amount of CO which ought to be once produced was observed.Along with the decrease of CO, the increase of CH 4 production was indeed observed, but the amount of produced CH 4 was far smaller than that of CO decrease.For this reason we cannot assume that CO is converted to CH 4 by hydrogenation during the long irradiation.As a consequence, it must be hypothesized that the Rh/ TiO 2 absorbed the CO.Detailed discussion will be found in the following section. As described in Section 2, the Rh/TiO 2 sample was reduced by H 2 at 523 K after the oxidization by O 2 at 673 K as a pretreatment before photoreactions.We investigated the effect of H 2 reduction of the Rh/TiO 2 sample in the pretreatment by varying the temperature of H 2 treatment on the Rh(1)/TiO 2 .The result is shown in Fig. 3. From this, we can notice that the increase in the reduction temperature above 523 K brings about the drastic decrease in the activity towards CO production.On the other hand, CH 4 production slightly increases when the reduction temperature increases.It suggests that the oxidation state of Rh in Rh(1)/TiO 2 sample controls the selectivity of CO 2 H 2 photoreaction as well as the activity of the reaction.In a word, it seems that when Rh remains oxidized in a proper degree, the activity towards CO production is high.However, when no H 2 treatment was given (i.e., Rh was in a fully oxidized state), the activity was very low either towards CO or CH 4 production: the amount of yielded CO and CH 4 were only 0.2 and 0.1 mmol, respectively.From this, the following ideas are implied: (1) when Rh in Rh/TiO 2 is moderately reduced, the Rh/TiO 2 sample shows the highest activity towards CO production, and (2) as Rh in Rh/TiO 2 is reduced excessively, the product selectivity shifts from CO to CH 4 along with the decrease in the activity. We investigated the effect of the loading amount of Rh on the reaction activity and selectivity with the temperature of H 2 reduction treatment xed to 523 K. Fig. 4 shows the amount of yielded CO and CH 4 over Rh/TiO 2 samples with various amounts of Rh loading after 6 h irradiation.The increase in Rh loading resulted in the decrease in CO evolution.When the amount of Rh increased, thermodynamically preferable CH 4 was yielded rather than CO, although the absolute amount of CH 4 evolution was small.The effect of an increase in the loading amount of Rh seems similar to that of the reductions at higher temperature than 523 K on Rh(1)/TiO 2 .From this, it is assumed that the variation of the loading amount causes the change of the state of Rh on TiO 2 .When the amount of Rh loading is low, Rh may be in a moderately reduced state on the surface of TiO 2 and assist to produce CO. To clarify the assumption mentioned above, we recorded the Rh K-edge X-ray absorption spectra and elucidated the state of Rh on various Rh(X)/TiO 2 (X0.54) samples after pretreatment.Fig. 5(A) shows the Rh K-edge XANES spectra of Rh/ TiO 2 sample with various amounts of Rh loading together with those of Rh foil and Rh 2 O 3 as references.Looking at the series of the spectra, we can see that the shape of the spectrum of Rh(4)/TiO 2 is similar to that of Rh foil, and that the shape of the spectra changes gradually to that of rhodium oxide with the increase of loaded Rh. There have been reports concerning that the XANES spectrum of a sample containing an element in a mixture of different states can be simulated by the linear combination of the spectra of reference compounds corresponding to each oxidation state 21,22.So we also tried to reproduce the XANES spectra of the Rh/TiO 2 samples by the superposition of the spectra of reference compounds with a suitable ratio.Fig. 6 shows the original XANES spectra of the samples with the simulated ones using Rh 2 O 3 and Rh foil as reference compounds.This clearly indicates that the increase in the Rh loading is responsible for the growth of Rh in a metallic state.It is also shown that even the Rh(0.5)/TiO 2 sample contains 35 of metal. On the other hand, Fourier-transforms of k 3 -weighted Rh K-edge EXAFS spectra of the Rh/TiO 2 samples and reference compounds mentioned above are shown in Fig. 5(B).While the peak at around 2.4 A E assigned to metallic RhRh bond is very weak in Rh(0.5)/TiO 2 , it is enhanced together with the increase in the amount of loaded Rh.The peak at around 1.6 A E is assigned to RhO bond, and the intensity of the peak decreases as the amount of Rh increases.The sample richest in Rh, Rh(4)/TiO 2 , shows almost no peak at around 1.6 A E . From the above-mentioned results obtained by the XAS experiments, we concluded that the highly active sample for the CO 2 H 2 photoreaction keeps Rh in a state of the mixture of metal and oxide.The state of Rh involves the selectivity of products also: the more the Rh is reduced, the more is CH 4 produced rather than CO.The former notion is again very similar to that proposed by Thampi et al. 12,13 with Ru/ TiO 2 sample. As described above, the reaction between CO 2 and H 2 over Rh/TiO 2 is enhanced by irradiation.We suppose that the light is absorbed by TiO 2 rather than Rh because no reaction proceeded when Rh/SiO 2 is used instead of Rh/ TiO 2 .Probably the light generates a pair of an excited electron and a positive hole in TiO 2 .The electron moves to Rh to be injected into CO 2 adsorbed on Rh, and the CO 2 is activated to become CO A 2 .This process has been proposed in the literature 15.On the other hand, H 2 is adsorbed on Rh dissociatively, and the dissociated hydrogen may migrate onto TiO 2 surface to react with the positive hole.This process results in the formation of H , which may be bound with an oxygen of TiO 2 to form surface hydroxyl group.In such a way the charge will be separated effectively. As the possibility of the evolution of CO from CO A 2 , the following reaction has been proposed on K-promoted Rh metal surface 23: That is, the disproportionation reaction of two CO A 2 anion radicals into CO and carbonate.As the carbonate species will exist in a stable form on TiO 2 surface, the migration of CO 2A 3 species to TiO 2 surface will further help the above disproportionation reaction. However, it should be kept in mind that there is a possibility of the CO production via any intermediate such as a formate ion.The CO A 2 radical is thought to be more reactive with hydrogen than a neutral CO 2 , and the most plausible product in the rst step of CO 2 hydrogenation is the formate ion.The formation of the formate ion from CO 2 and H 2 in a thermal reaction on supported Rh has already been reported 24.The formate is known to decompose rather easily to yield CO. Since the evolution of CO was practically observed on Rh/TiO 2 under irradiation using formic acid together with H 2 as a reactant, we guess that this mechanism is preferable to that explained from the disproportionation of CO A 2 radical. We have found that when Rh is in a partially reduced state, Rh/TiO 2 shows a high activity in the reaction between CO 2 and H 2 to yield CO. On the contrary, when Rh is reduced to a metallic state, the activity is low and the main product is not CO but CH 4 .This phenomenon can be expressed from the differences in the ability of H 2 dissociation.When Rh is in a partially reduced state, the H 2 dissociation ability of the Rh is suppressed at a suitable degree.When Rh is fully reduced to a metallic state, the H 2 dissociation ability is too strong, and the dissociated hydrogen not only accepts the positive hole but also reacts with negatively charged CO A 2 to hydrogenate it.If the hydrogenation of CO A 2 is completed, the product CH 4 will be released to the gas phase; however, it is suggested that the CO A 2 is not easily hydrogenated to CH 4 but remains on the surface as a form of CH x , because when Rh is fully reduced, the amount of CH 4 is small while the evolution of CO remarkably decreases.This excessive hydrogenation reaction cannot proceed via CO as an intermediate because CO and H 2 did not react on Rh/TiO 2 under irradiation at room temperature. According to the above view, however, the difference of Ru and Rh in the selectivity in CO 2 H 2 reaction cannot be explained.In addition, one cannot illustrate the reason why the highly reduced Ru/TiO 2 does not exhibit higher activity in CH 4 production than partially reduced one.From this, it should be concluded that the oxide state plays an important role as a promoter in some steps of the reaction.Although it is not clear in which step the oxide state works effectively, it may assist the redox reaction between CO 2 and H 2 by changing its oxidation state. Fig. 1 shows the result of CO 2 H 2 reaction under irradiation of several parts of wavelengths, as well as in the dark.It is noteworthy that CO is yielded as a main product of CO 2 reduction even in the dark.CO is an unreasonable product considering the thermodynamic equilibrium of the reverse water-gas shift reaction CO 2 g H 2 g 3 CO g H 2 O gY AG 28X6 kJamol at 298X15 K at room temperature (or at 323 K).This contradiction indicates the removal of one (or two) product(s) which causes the shift of the equilibrium to the right. It is thought that the surface of TiO 2 is highly dehydrated after the evacuation at high temperature in the pretreatment.Hence, signicant amount of surface hydroxyl group can be produced newly on TiO 2 .As H 2 directly forms surface hydroxyl group during the CO 2 H 2 reaction according to the reaction mechanism we proposed in the previous section, it is thought that H 2 O need not be released into the gas phase in the dark reaction for a while. The amount of CO increased from 3.4 to 5.1 mmol when the reaction time was extended from 6 to 24 h in the dark at 323 K.However, the reaction rate is small compared to the case under irradiation.Therefore we have claimed that the reaction is a photo-enhanced reaction'' as Thampi et al. 12,13 previously declared.It should be noted that the dark reactions were performed at 323 K.This temperature is rather higher than the temperature of the reaction system under irradiation.Hence, the amount of CO produced in the dark may be less than 3.4 mmol for 6 h reaction.When the Y-45 optical lter was put to use (i.e., the light with wavelength longer than 450 nm was irradiated), the amount of CO was only 1.4 mmol even under irradiation, although the tempera-ture of the reactor was not very different from each other under irradiation using any optical lter.Thus the value of 1.4 mmol is to be considered as the contribution of the CO evolution by the dark reaction under photoirradiation, since the light with wavelength longer than 450 nm does not contribute to the excitation of TiO 2 .From this, the amount of CO by pure photoreaction should be 7.8 mmol for 6 h reaction, because the total amount of evolved CO is 9.2 mmol and the amount of CO produced by the dark reaction is 1.4 mmol.Therefore, the ratio of the production of CO by the dark reaction to that of the photoreaction under irradiation without any lter is calculated to be only 18. As depicted in Fig. 2, we can understand that CO is once yielded at the earlier stage of the reaction, but removed from the gas phase afterwards.It suggests that CO is adsorbed to Rh/TiO 2 or converted to other compounds.Between these two possibilities, the former one (i.e., simple adsorption process) should be excluded.If the adsorption was the main reason, a part of produced CO might have immediately been adsorbed on Rh/TiO 2 after its production, and the other part might have been released to the gas phase since the rate of CO adsorption was thought to be enough fast.Therefore the amount of CO might increase monotonously.In practice, however, the amount of CO in the gas phase decreased after reaching the maximum amount.Hence the simple adsorption should not be the reason of this peculiar behavior.This leads us to the conclusion that CO is converted to other compounds during the long period of reaction. Many investigators have reported that Rh forms rhodium carbonyl clusters under CO atmosphere 25.Considering that, we prospected the formation of Rh m (CO) n species during the photoreaction because in later part of the photoreaction the Rh/TiO 2 sample is surrounded with gaseous CO produced in the reaction.The conversion of Rh into Rh m (CO) n species can also be the reason of the decrease in the activity towards CO production.Accordingly, the rapid decrease of gaseous CO after long time irradiation can be successfully explained: the rapid decrease of CO is brought about both by the reaction between Rh and CO, and by the decline of the production of CO. The formation of Rh m (CO) n is supported by the desorbed gases by heat treatment at 573 K after photoreaction.The main component of the desorbed gases by heat treatment was CO.This indicates that more amount of CO exists on the surface of Rh/TiO 2 , although it is not clear in which form they exist on the surface.However, taking it into consideration that the Rh m (CO) n species was decomposed at temperature up to ca. 573 K 26, the carbonyl cluster is one of the candidates of the compounds formed during photoreaction on the surface.Furthermore, the XANES spectrum of Rh/TiO 2 also suggests the change of the state of Rh before and after photoreaction.The XANES spectra of Rh(1)/TiO 2 and Rh(4)/TiO 2 after photoreaction and their simulation spectra using those of reference compounds are shown in Fig. 7.A good tting result was achieved in the case of Rh(4)/TiO 2 (Fig. 7(a)), while in Rh(1)/TiO 2 the tting with the spectra of Rh foil and Rh 2 O 3 as the reference compounds did not get along well.Taking into account that the spectrum of Rh(1)/ TiO 2 before photoreaction could be t with those of the reference compounds, we concluded that another chemical species than a metal or an oxide formed on Rh(1)/TiO 2 during the photoreaction.It is supposed that the other species is the compound made of Rh and CO.Therefore, we tried to simulate the XANES of Rh(1)/TiO 2 after photoreaction using the spectrum of Rh(CO) 2 Cl 2 along with Rh foil and Rh 2 O 3 .The result was a little better than that without Rh(CO) 2 Cl 2 as shown in Fig. 7(b).This suggests the formation of rhodium carbonyl compounds in a sense.However, we should not establish the existence of the compounds simply because of the success in the simulation of XANES spectrum by Rh(CO) 2 Cl 2 .It is only a reinforcement of the hypothesis and the speculation. The above results are, of course, not enough for the evidences pointing out that rhodium carbonyl compounds form on Rh/TiO 2 .However, it is certain that the compound to which CO is converted does not relate to the reaction path of CO 2 photoreduction by H 2 : the compound is yielded after the production of CO from CO 2 and H 2 .Therefore, if we can remove CO from the reactor by some chemical engineering methods, the photoreaction possibly proceeds continuously because the change in the state of Rh can be avoided."}, {"llm generation": "Rh/TiO 2", "source": "From these results, we claim that the CO 2 reduction by H 2 on Rh/TiO 2 is a photoenhanced reaction similar to the concept suggested with Ru loaded TiO 2 12,13.", "context": "We tried to reduce CO 2 by H 2 on Rh(1)/TiO 2 under photoirradiation.After 6 h irradiation, 9.2 mmol of CO and a small amount (0.1 mmol) of CH 4 were produced.Any other products such as hydrocarbons or oxygenates were not detected.The activity was very high compared to those reported by us previously using the same reaction system with ZrO 2 samples 19,20.When only CO 2 was introduced and no H 2 was admitted to the reactor, no product was detected even after photoirradiation.On the contrary, when only H 2 (i.e., no CO 2 ) was introduced, the evolution of CH 4 was observed.This indicates that there are some carbon residues on the Rh/TiO 2 sample.However, the amount of CH 4 was too small (0.05 mmol).From these results, we concluded that the CO obtained here comes from CO 2 , and that this reaction is a reduction of CO 2 by H 2 . The dependence of the reaction on the wavelength of irradiation light was investigated by cutting off a part of the wavelength region of the irradiation light by a series of optical glass lters.Apparently, the activity towards CO production decreased when the irradiation light was ltered on the longer wavelength as shown in Fig. 1.Since the temperature of the reactor was not so different from each other between the case with or without any optical lters, the change in the activity observed here may be due to the change in the wavelength of light rather than in the heat supplied by irradiated light.This result leads us to the conclusion that some photochemical processes are included in this reaction.However, it is not a pure photoreaction because signicant amount of CO was produced even when no irradiation was supplied with the reactor slightly temperature-elevated in the water bath (323 K).The amount of CO production in the dark was larger than that with a glass lter cutting !370 nm or !450 nm.This is not surprising considering that the temperature of the reactor was lower than 323 K under photoirradiation.From these results, we claim that the CO 2 reduction by H 2 on Rh/TiO 2 is a photoenhanced reaction similar to the concept suggested with Ru loaded TiO 2 12,13.Fig. 2 shows the time course of CO production over Rh(1)/TiO 2 under continuous photoirradiation.In the earlier stage of photoreaction, the amount of CO naturally increased with time; however, the increase stopped about 10 h after the photoirradiation started.On the contrary, the decrease in the amount of CO which ought to be once produced was observed.Along with the decrease of CO, the increase of CH 4 production was indeed observed, but the amount of produced CH 4 was far smaller than that of CO decrease.For this reason we cannot assume that CO is converted to CH 4 by hydrogenation during the long irradiation.As a consequence, it must be hypothesized that the Rh/ TiO 2 absorbed the CO.Detailed discussion will be found in the following section. As described in Section 2, the Rh/TiO 2 sample was reduced by H 2 at 523 K after the oxidization by O 2 at 673 K as a pretreatment before photoreactions.We investigated the effect of H 2 reduction of the Rh/TiO 2 sample in the pretreatment by varying the temperature of H 2 treatment on the Rh(1)/TiO 2 .The result is shown in Fig. 3. From this, we can notice that the increase in the reduction temperature above 523 K brings about the drastic decrease in the activity towards CO production.On the other hand, CH 4 production slightly increases when the reduction temperature increases.It suggests that the oxidation state of Rh in Rh(1)/TiO 2 sample controls the selectivity of CO 2 H 2 photoreaction as well as the activity of the reaction.In a word, it seems that when Rh remains oxidized in a proper degree, the activity towards CO production is high.However, when no H 2 treatment was given (i.e., Rh was in a fully oxidized state), the activity was very low either towards CO or CH 4 production: the amount of yielded CO and CH 4 were only 0.2 and 0.1 mmol, respectively.From this, the following ideas are implied: (1) when Rh in Rh/TiO 2 is moderately reduced, the Rh/TiO 2 sample shows the highest activity towards CO production, and (2) as Rh in Rh/TiO 2 is reduced excessively, the product selectivity shifts from CO to CH 4 along with the decrease in the activity. We investigated the effect of the loading amount of Rh on the reaction activity and selectivity with the temperature of H 2 reduction treatment xed to 523 K. Fig. 4 shows the amount of yielded CO and CH 4 over Rh/TiO 2 samples with various amounts of Rh loading after 6 h irradiation.The increase in Rh loading resulted in the decrease in CO evolution.When the amount of Rh increased, thermodynamically preferable CH 4 was yielded rather than CO, although the absolute amount of CH 4 evolution was small.The effect of an increase in the loading amount of Rh seems similar to that of the reductions at higher temperature than 523 K on Rh(1)/TiO 2 .From this, it is assumed that the variation of the loading amount causes the change of the state of Rh on TiO 2 .When the amount of Rh loading is low, Rh may be in a moderately reduced state on the surface of TiO 2 and assist to produce CO. To clarify the assumption mentioned above, we recorded the Rh K-edge X-ray absorption spectra and elucidated the state of Rh on various Rh(X)/TiO 2 (X0.54) samples after pretreatment.Fig. 5(A) shows the Rh K-edge XANES spectra of Rh/ TiO 2 sample with various amounts of Rh loading together with those of Rh foil and Rh 2 O 3 as references.Looking at the series of the spectra, we can see that the shape of the spectrum of Rh(4)/TiO 2 is similar to that of Rh foil, and that the shape of the spectra changes gradually to that of rhodium oxide with the increase of loaded Rh. There have been reports concerning that the XANES spectrum of a sample containing an element in a mixture of different states can be simulated by the linear combination of the spectra of reference compounds corresponding to each oxidation state 21,22.So we also tried to reproduce the XANES spectra of the Rh/TiO 2 samples by the superposition of the spectra of reference compounds with a suitable ratio.Fig. 6 shows the original XANES spectra of the samples with the simulated ones using Rh 2 O 3 and Rh foil as reference compounds.This clearly indicates that the increase in the Rh loading is responsible for the growth of Rh in a metallic state.It is also shown that even the Rh(0.5)/TiO 2 sample contains 35 of metal. On the other hand, Fourier-transforms of k 3 -weighted Rh K-edge EXAFS spectra of the Rh/TiO 2 samples and reference compounds mentioned above are shown in Fig. 5(B).While the peak at around 2.4 A E assigned to metallic RhRh bond is very weak in Rh(0.5)/TiO 2 , it is enhanced together with the increase in the amount of loaded Rh.The peak at around 1.6 A E is assigned to RhO bond, and the intensity of the peak decreases as the amount of Rh increases.The sample richest in Rh, Rh(4)/TiO 2 , shows almost no peak at around 1.6 A E . From the above-mentioned results obtained by the XAS experiments, we concluded that the highly active sample for the CO 2 H 2 photoreaction keeps Rh in a state of the mixture of metal and oxide.The state of Rh involves the selectivity of products also: the more the Rh is reduced, the more is CH 4 produced rather than CO.The former notion is again very similar to that proposed by Thampi et al. 12,13 with Ru/ TiO 2 sample. As described above, the reaction between CO 2 and H 2 over Rh/TiO 2 is enhanced by irradiation.We suppose that the light is absorbed by TiO 2 rather than Rh because no reaction proceeded when Rh/SiO 2 is used instead of Rh/ TiO 2 .Probably the light generates a pair of an excited electron and a positive hole in TiO 2 .The electron moves to Rh to be injected into CO 2 adsorbed on Rh, and the CO 2 is activated to become CO A 2 .This process has been proposed in the literature 15.On the other hand, H 2 is adsorbed on Rh dissociatively, and the dissociated hydrogen may migrate onto TiO 2 surface to react with the positive hole.This process results in the formation of H , which may be bound with an oxygen of TiO 2 to form surface hydroxyl group.In such a way the charge will be separated effectively. As the possibility of the evolution of CO from CO A 2 , the following reaction has been proposed on K-promoted Rh metal surface 23: That is, the disproportionation reaction of two CO A 2 anion radicals into CO and carbonate.As the carbonate species will exist in a stable form on TiO 2 surface, the migration of CO 2A 3 species to TiO 2 surface will further help the above disproportionation reaction. However, it should be kept in mind that there is a possibility of the CO production via any intermediate such as a formate ion.The CO A 2 radical is thought to be more reactive with hydrogen than a neutral CO 2 , and the most plausible product in the rst step of CO 2 hydrogenation is the formate ion.The formation of the formate ion from CO 2 and H 2 in a thermal reaction on supported Rh has already been reported 24.The formate is known to decompose rather easily to yield CO.

On the other hand, Fourier-transforms of k 3 -weighted Rh K-edge EXAFS spectra of the Rh/TiO 2 samples and reference compounds mentioned above are shown in Fig. 5(B).While the peak at around 2.4 A E assigned to metallic RhRh bond is very weak in Rh(0.5)/TiO 2 , it is enhanced together with the increase in the amount of loaded Rh.The peak at around 1.6 A E is assigned to RhO bond, and the intensity of the peak decreases as the amount of Rh increases.The sample richest in Rh, Rh(4)/TiO 2 , shows almost no peak at around 1.6 A E . From the above-mentioned results obtained by the XAS experiments, we concluded that the highly active sample for the CO 2 H 2 photoreaction keeps Rh in a state of the mixture of metal and oxide.The state of Rh involves the selectivity of products also: the more the Rh is reduced, the more is CH 4 produced rather than CO.The former notion is again very similar to that proposed by Thampi et al. 12,13 with Ru/ TiO 2 sample. As described above, the reaction between CO 2 and H 2 over Rh/TiO 2 is enhanced by irradiation.We suppose that the light is absorbed by TiO 2 rather than Rh because no reaction proceeded when Rh/SiO 2 is used instead of Rh/ TiO 2 .Probably the light generates a pair of an excited electron and a positive hole in TiO 2 .The electron moves to Rh to be injected into CO 2 adsorbed on Rh, and the CO 2 is activated to become CO A 2 .This process has been proposed in the literature 15.On the other hand, H 2 is adsorbed on Rh dissociatively, and the dissociated hydrogen may migrate onto TiO 2 surface to react with the positive hole.This process results in the formation of H , which may be bound with an oxygen of TiO 2 to form surface hydroxyl group.In such a way the charge will be separated effectively. As the possibility of the evolution of CO from CO A 2 , the following reaction has been proposed on K-promoted Rh metal surface 23: That is, the disproportionation reaction of two CO A 2 anion radicals into CO and carbonate.As the carbonate species will exist in a stable form on TiO 2 surface, the migration of CO 2A 3 species to TiO 2 surface will further help the above disproportionation reaction. However, it should be kept in mind that there is a possibility of the CO production via any intermediate such as a formate ion.The CO A 2 radical is thought to be more reactive with hydrogen than a neutral CO 2 , and the most plausible product in the rst step of CO 2 hydrogenation is the formate ion.The formation of the formate ion from CO 2 and H 2 in a thermal reaction on supported Rh has already been reported 24.The formate is known to decompose rather easily to yield CO. Since the evolution of CO was practically observed on Rh/TiO 2 under irradiation using formic acid together with H 2 as a reactant, we guess that this mechanism is preferable to that explained from the disproportionation of CO A 2 radical. We have found that when Rh is in a partially reduced state, Rh/TiO 2 shows a high activity in the reaction between CO 2 and H 2 to yield CO. On the contrary, when Rh is reduced to a metallic state, the activity is low and the main product is not CO but CH 4 .This phenomenon can be expressed from the differences in the ability of H 2 dissociation.When Rh is in a partially reduced state, the H 2 dissociation ability of the Rh is suppressed at a suitable degree.When Rh is fully reduced to a metallic state, the H 2 dissociation ability is too strong, and the dissociated hydrogen not only accepts the positive hole but also reacts with negatively charged CO A 2 to hydrogenate it.If the hydrogenation of CO A 2 is completed, the product CH 4 will be released to the gas phase; however, it is suggested that the CO A 2 is not easily hydrogenated to CH 4 but remains on the surface as a form of CH x , because when Rh is fully reduced, the amount of CH 4 is small while the evolution of CO remarkably decreases.This excessive hydrogenation reaction cannot proceed via CO as an intermediate because CO and H 2 did not react on Rh/TiO 2 under irradiation at room temperature. According to the above view, however, the difference of Ru and Rh in the selectivity in CO 2 H 2 reaction cannot be explained.In addition, one cannot illustrate the reason why the highly reduced Ru/TiO 2 does not exhibit higher activity in CH 4 production than partially reduced one.From this, it should be concluded that the oxide state plays an important role as a promoter in some steps of the reaction.Although it is not clear in which step the oxide state works effectively, it may assist the redox reaction between CO 2 and H 2 by changing its oxidation state. Fig. 1 shows the result of CO 2 H 2 reaction under irradiation of several parts of wavelengths, as well as in the dark.It is noteworthy that CO is yielded as a main product of CO 2 reduction even in the dark.CO is an unreasonable product considering the thermodynamic equilibrium of the reverse water-gas shift reaction CO 2 g H 2 g 3 CO g H 2 O gY AG 28X6 kJamol at 298X15 K at room temperature (or at 323 K).This contradiction indicates the removal of one (or two) product(s) which causes the shift of the equilibrium to the right. It is thought that the surface of TiO 2 is highly dehydrated after the evacuation at high temperature in the pretreatment.Hence, signicant amount of surface hydroxyl group can be produced newly on TiO 2 .As H 2 directly forms surface hydroxyl group during the CO 2 H 2 reaction according to the reaction mechanism we proposed in the previous section, it is thought that H 2 O need not be released into the gas phase in the dark reaction for a while. The amount of CO increased from 3.4 to 5.1 mmol when the reaction time was extended from 6 to 24 h in the dark at 323 K.However, the reaction rate is small compared to the case under irradiation.Therefore we have claimed that the reaction is a photo-enhanced reaction'' as Thampi et al. 12,13 previously declared.It should be noted that the dark reactions were performed at 323 K.This temperature is rather higher than the temperature of the reaction system under irradiation.Hence, the amount of CO produced in the dark may be less than 3.4 mmol for 6 h reaction.When the Y-45 optical lter was put to use (i.e., the light with wavelength longer than 450 nm was irradiated), the amount of CO was only 1.4 mmol even under irradiation, although the tempera-ture of the reactor was not very different from each other under irradiation using any optical lter.Thus the value of 1.4 mmol is to be considered as the contribution of the CO evolution by the dark reaction under photoirradiation, since the light with wavelength longer than 450 nm does not contribute to the excitation of TiO 2 .From this, the amount of CO by pure photoreaction should be 7.8 mmol for 6 h reaction, because the total amount of evolved CO is 9.2 mmol and the amount of CO produced by the dark reaction is 1.4 mmol.Therefore, the ratio of the production of CO by the dark reaction to that of the photoreaction under irradiation without any lter is calculated to be only 18. As depicted in Fig. 2, we can understand that CO is once yielded at the earlier stage of the reaction, but removed from the gas phase afterwards.It suggests that CO is adsorbed to Rh/TiO 2 or converted to other compounds.Between these two possibilities, the former one (i.e., simple adsorption process) should be excluded.If the adsorption was the main reason, a part of produced CO might have immediately been adsorbed on Rh/TiO 2 after its production, and the other part might have been released to the gas phase since the rate of CO adsorption was thought to be enough fast.Therefore the amount of CO might increase monotonously.In practice, however, the amount of CO in the gas phase decreased after reaching the maximum amount.Hence the simple adsorption should not be the reason of this peculiar behavior.This leads us to the conclusion that CO is converted to other compounds during the long period of reaction. Many investigators have reported that Rh forms rhodium carbonyl clusters under CO atmosphere 25.Considering that, we prospected the formation of Rh m (CO) n species during the photoreaction because in later part of the photoreaction the Rh/TiO 2 sample is surrounded with gaseous CO produced in the reaction.The conversion of Rh into Rh m (CO) n species can also be the reason of the decrease in the activity towards CO production.Accordingly, the rapid decrease of gaseous CO after long time irradiation can be successfully explained: the rapid decrease of CO is brought about both by the reaction between Rh and CO, and by the decline of the production of CO. The formation of Rh m (CO) n is supported by the desorbed gases by heat treatment at 573 K after photoreaction.The main component of the desorbed gases by heat treatment was CO.This indicates that more amount of CO exists on the surface of Rh/TiO 2 , although it is not clear in which form they exist on the surface.However, taking it into consideration that the Rh m (CO) n species was decomposed at temperature up to ca. 573 K 26, the carbonyl cluster is one of the candidates of the compounds formed during photoreaction on the surface.Furthermore, the XANES spectrum of Rh/TiO 2 also suggests the change of the state of Rh before and after photoreaction.The XANES spectra of Rh(1)/TiO 2 and Rh(4)/TiO 2 after photoreaction and their simulation spectra using those of reference compounds are shown in Fig. 7.A good tting result was achieved in the case of Rh(4)/TiO 2 (Fig. 7(a)), while in Rh(1)/TiO 2 the tting with the spectra of Rh foil and Rh 2 O 3 as the reference compounds did not get along well.Taking into account that the spectrum of Rh(1)/ TiO 2 before photoreaction could be t with those of the reference compounds, we concluded that another chemical species than a metal or an oxide formed on Rh(1)/TiO 2 during the photoreaction.It is supposed that the other species is the compound made of Rh and CO.Therefore, we tried to simulate the XANES of Rh(1)/TiO 2 after photoreaction using the spectrum of Rh(CO) 2 Cl 2 along with Rh foil and Rh 2 O 3 .The result was a little better than that without Rh(CO) 2 Cl 2 as shown in Fig. 7(b).This suggests the formation of rhodium carbonyl compounds in a sense.However, we should not establish the existence of the compounds simply because of the success in the simulation of XANES spectrum by Rh(CO) 2 Cl 2 .It is only a reinforcement of the hypothesis and the speculation. The above results are, of course, not enough for the evidences pointing out that rhodium carbonyl compounds form on Rh/TiO 2 .However, it is certain that the compound to which CO is converted does not relate to the reaction path of CO 2 photoreduction by H 2 : the compound is yielded after the production of CO from CO 2 and H 2 .Therefore, if we can remove CO from the reactor by some chemical engineering methods, the photoreaction possibly proceeds continuously because the change in the state of Rh can be avoided."}, {"llm generation": "Rh/SiO 2", "source": "We suppose that the light is absorbed by TiO 2 rather than Rh because no reaction proceeded when Rh/SiO 2 is used instead of Rh/ TiO 2 .", "context": "We tried to reduce CO 2 by H 2 on Rh(1)/TiO 2 under photoirradiation.After 6 h irradiation, 9.2 mmol of CO and a small amount (0.1 mmol) of CH 4 were produced.Any other products such as hydrocarbons or oxygenates were not detected.The activity was very high compared to those reported by us previously using the same reaction system with ZrO 2 samples 19,20.When only CO 2 was introduced and no H 2 was admitted to the reactor, no product was detected even after photoirradiation.On the contrary, when only H 2 (i.e., no CO 2 ) was introduced, the evolution of CH 4 was observed.This indicates that there are some carbon residues on the Rh/TiO 2 sample.However, the amount of CH 4 was too small (0.05 mmol).From these results, we concluded that the CO obtained here comes from CO 2 , and that this reaction is a reduction of CO 2 by H 2 . The dependence of the reaction on the wavelength of irradiation light was investigated by cutting off a part of the wavelength region of the irradiation light by a series of optical glass lters.Apparently, the activity towards CO production decreased when the irradiation light was ltered on the longer wavelength as shown in Fig. 1.Since the temperature of the reactor was not so different from each other between the case with or without any optical lters, the change in the activity observed here may be due to the change in the wavelength of light rather than in the heat supplied by irradiated light.This result leads us to the conclusion that some photochemical processes are included in this reaction.However, it is not a pure photoreaction because signicant amount of CO was produced even when no irradiation was supplied with the reactor slightly temperature-elevated in the water bath (323 K).The amount of CO production in the dark was larger than that with a glass lter cutting !370 nm or !450 nm.This is not surprising considering that the temperature of the reactor was lower than 323 K under photoirradiation.From these results, we claim that the CO 2 reduction by H 2 on Rh/TiO 2 is a photoenhanced reaction similar to the concept suggested with Ru loaded TiO 2 12,13.Fig. 2 shows the time course of CO production over Rh(1)/TiO 2 under continuous photoirradiation.In the earlier stage of photoreaction, the amount of CO naturally increased with time; however, the increase stopped about 10 h after the photoirradiation started.On the contrary, the decrease in the amount of CO which ought to be once produced was observed.Along with the decrease of CO, the increase of CH 4 production was indeed observed, but the amount of produced CH 4 was far smaller than that of CO decrease.For this reason we cannot assume that CO is converted to CH 4 by hydrogenation during the long irradiation.As a consequence, it must be hypothesized that the Rh/ TiO 2 absorbed the CO.Detailed discussion will be found in the following section. As described in Section 2, the Rh/TiO 2 sample was reduced by H 2 at 523 K after the oxidization by O 2 at 673 K as a pretreatment before photoreactions.We investigated the effect of H 2 reduction of the Rh/TiO 2 sample in the pretreatment by varying the temperature of H 2 treatment on the Rh(1)/TiO 2 .The result is shown in Fig. 3. From this, we can notice that the increase in the reduction temperature above 523 K brings about the drastic decrease in the activity towards CO production.On the other hand, CH 4 production slightly increases when the reduction temperature increases.It suggests that the oxidation state of Rh in Rh(1)/TiO 2 sample controls the selectivity of CO 2 H 2 photoreaction as well as the activity of the reaction.In a word, it seems that when Rh remains oxidized in a proper degree, the activity towards CO production is high.However, when no H 2 treatment was given (i.e., Rh was in a fully oxidized state), the activity was very low either towards CO or CH 4 production: the amount of yielded CO and CH 4 were only 0.2 and 0.1 mmol, respectively.From this, the following ideas are implied: (1) when Rh in Rh/TiO 2 is moderately reduced, the Rh/TiO 2 sample shows the highest activity towards CO production, and (2) as Rh in Rh/TiO 2 is reduced excessively, the product selectivity shifts from CO to CH 4 along with the decrease in the activity. We investigated the effect of the loading amount of Rh on the reaction activity and selectivity with the temperature of H 2 reduction treatment xed to 523 K. Fig. 4 shows the amount of yielded CO and CH 4 over Rh/TiO 2 samples with various amounts of Rh loading after 6 h irradiation.The increase in Rh loading resulted in the decrease in CO evolution.When the amount of Rh increased, thermodynamically preferable CH 4 was yielded rather than CO, although the absolute amount of CH 4 evolution was small.The effect of an increase in the loading amount of Rh seems similar to that of the reductions at higher temperature than 523 K on Rh(1)/TiO 2 .From this, it is assumed that the variation of the loading amount causes the change of the state of Rh on TiO 2 .When the amount of Rh loading is low, Rh may be in a moderately reduced state on the surface of TiO 2 and assist to produce CO. To clarify the assumption mentioned above, we recorded the Rh K-edge X-ray absorption spectra and elucidated the state of Rh on various Rh(X)/TiO 2 (X0.54) samples after pretreatment.Fig. 5(A) shows the Rh K-edge XANES spectra of Rh/ TiO 2 sample with various amounts of Rh loading together with those of Rh foil and Rh 2 O 3 as references.Looking at the series of the spectra, we can see that the shape of the spectrum of Rh(4)/TiO 2 is similar to that of Rh foil, and that the shape of the spectra changes gradually to that of rhodium oxide with the increase of loaded Rh.

The dependence of the reaction on the wavelength of irradiation light was investigated by cutting off a part of the wavelength region of the irradiation light by a series of optical glass lters.Apparently, the activity towards CO production decreased when the irradiation light was ltered on the longer wavelength as shown in Fig. 1.Since the temperature of the reactor was not so different from each other between the case with or without any optical lters, the change in the activity observed here may be due to the change in the wavelength of light rather than in the heat supplied by irradiated light.This result leads us to the conclusion that some photochemical processes are included in this reaction.However, it is not a pure photoreaction because signicant amount of CO was produced even when no irradiation was supplied with the reactor slightly temperature-elevated in the water bath (323 K).The amount of CO production in the dark was larger than that with a glass lter cutting !370 nm or !450 nm.This is not surprising considering that the temperature of the reactor was lower than 323 K under photoirradiation.From these results, we claim that the CO 2 reduction by H 2 on Rh/TiO 2 is a photoenhanced reaction similar to the concept suggested with Ru loaded TiO 2 12,13.Fig. 2 shows the time course of CO production over Rh(1)/TiO 2 under continuous photoirradiation.In the earlier stage of photoreaction, the amount of CO naturally increased with time; however, the increase stopped about 10 h after the photoirradiation started.On the contrary, the decrease in the amount of CO which ought to be once produced was observed.Along with the decrease of CO, the increase of CH 4 production was indeed observed, but the amount of produced CH 4 was far smaller than that of CO decrease.For this reason we cannot assume that CO is converted to CH 4 by hydrogenation during the long irradiation.As a consequence, it must be hypothesized that the Rh/ TiO 2 absorbed the CO.Detailed discussion will be found in the following section. As described in Section 2, the Rh/TiO 2 sample was reduced by H 2 at 523 K after the oxidization by O 2 at 673 K as a pretreatment before photoreactions.We investigated the effect of H 2 reduction of the Rh/TiO 2 sample in the pretreatment by varying the temperature of H 2 treatment on the Rh(1)/TiO 2 .The result is shown in Fig. 3. From this, we can notice that the increase in the reduction temperature above 523 K brings about the drastic decrease in the activity towards CO production.On the other hand, CH 4 production slightly increases when the reduction temperature increases.It suggests that the oxidation state of Rh in Rh(1)/TiO 2 sample controls the selectivity of CO 2 H 2 photoreaction as well as the activity of the reaction.In a word, it seems that when Rh remains oxidized in a proper degree, the activity towards CO production is high.However, when no H 2 treatment was given (i.e., Rh was in a fully oxidized state), the activity was very low either towards CO or CH 4 production: the amount of yielded CO and CH 4 were only 0.2 and 0.1 mmol, respectively.From this, the following ideas are implied: (1) when Rh in Rh/TiO 2 is moderately reduced, the Rh/TiO 2 sample shows the highest activity towards CO production, and (2) as Rh in Rh/TiO 2 is reduced excessively, the product selectivity shifts from CO to CH 4 along with the decrease in the activity. We investigated the effect of the loading amount of Rh on the reaction activity and selectivity with the temperature of H 2 reduction treatment xed to 523 K. Fig. 4 shows the amount of yielded CO and CH 4 over Rh/TiO 2 samples with various amounts of Rh loading after 6 h irradiation.The increase in Rh loading resulted in the decrease in CO evolution.When the amount of Rh increased, thermodynamically preferable CH 4 was yielded rather than CO, although the absolute amount of CH 4 evolution was small.The effect of an increase in the loading amount of Rh seems similar to that of the reductions at higher temperature than 523 K on Rh(1)/TiO 2 .From this, it is assumed that the variation of the loading amount causes the change of the state of Rh on TiO 2 .When the amount of Rh loading is low, Rh may be in a moderately reduced state on the surface of TiO 2 and assist to produce CO. To clarify the assumption mentioned above, we recorded the Rh K-edge X-ray absorption spectra and elucidated the state of Rh on various Rh(X)/TiO 2 (X0.54) samples after pretreatment.Fig. 5(A) shows the Rh K-edge XANES spectra of Rh/ TiO 2 sample with various amounts of Rh loading together with those of Rh foil and Rh 2 O 3 as references.Looking at the series of the spectra, we can see that the shape of the spectrum of Rh(4)/TiO 2 is similar to that of Rh foil, and that the shape of the spectra changes gradually to that of rhodium oxide with the increase of loaded Rh. There have been reports concerning that the XANES spectrum of a sample containing an element in a mixture of different states can be simulated by the linear combination of the spectra of reference compounds corresponding to each oxidation state 21,22.So we also tried to reproduce the XANES spectra of the Rh/TiO 2 samples by the superposition of the spectra of reference compounds with a suitable ratio.Fig. 6 shows the original XANES spectra of the samples with the simulated ones using Rh 2 O 3 and Rh foil as reference compounds.This clearly indicates that the increase in the Rh loading is responsible for the growth of Rh in a metallic state.It is also shown that even the Rh(0.5)/TiO 2 sample contains 35 of metal. On the other hand, Fourier-transforms of k 3 -weighted Rh K-edge EXAFS spectra of the Rh/TiO 2 samples and reference compounds mentioned above are shown in Fig. 5(B).While the peak at around 2.4 A E assigned to metallic RhRh bond is very weak in Rh(0.5)/TiO 2 , it is enhanced together with the increase in the amount of loaded Rh.The peak at around 1.6 A E is assigned to RhO bond, and the intensity of the peak decreases as the amount of Rh increases.The sample richest in Rh, Rh(4)/TiO 2 , shows almost no peak at around 1.6 A E . From the above-mentioned results obtained by the XAS experiments, we concluded that the highly active sample for the CO 2 H 2 photoreaction keeps Rh in a state of the mixture of metal and oxide.The state of Rh involves the selectivity of products also: the more the Rh is reduced, the more is CH 4 produced rather than CO.The former notion is again very similar to that proposed by Thampi et al. 12,13 with Ru/ TiO 2 sample. As described above, the reaction between CO 2 and H 2 over Rh/TiO 2 is enhanced by irradiation.We suppose that the light is absorbed by TiO 2 rather than Rh because no reaction proceeded when Rh/SiO 2 is used instead of Rh/ TiO 2 .Probably the light generates a pair of an excited electron and a positive hole in TiO 2 .The electron moves to Rh to be injected into CO 2 adsorbed on Rh, and the CO 2 is activated to become CO A 2 .This process has been proposed in the literature 15.On the other hand, H 2 is adsorbed on Rh dissociatively, and the dissociated hydrogen may migrate onto TiO 2 surface to react with the positive hole.This process results in the formation of H , which may be bound with an oxygen of TiO 2 to form surface hydroxyl group.In such a way the charge will be separated effectively. As the possibility of the evolution of CO from CO A 2 , the following reaction has been proposed on K-promoted Rh metal surface 23: That is, the disproportionation reaction of two CO A 2 anion radicals into CO and carbonate.As the carbonate species will exist in a stable form on TiO 2 surface, the migration of CO 2A 3 species to TiO 2 surface will further help the above disproportionation reaction. However, it should be kept in mind that there is a possibility of the CO production via any intermediate such as a formate ion.The CO A 2 radical is thought to be more reactive with hydrogen than a neutral CO 2 , and the most plausible product in the rst step of CO 2 hydrogenation is the formate ion.The formation of the formate ion from CO 2 and H 2 in a thermal reaction on supported Rh has already been reported 24.The formate is known to decompose rather easily to yield CO. Since the evolution of CO was practically observed on Rh/TiO 2 under irradiation using formic acid together with H 2 as a reactant, we guess that this mechanism is preferable to that explained from the disproportionation of CO A 2 radical. We have found that when Rh is in a partially reduced state, Rh/TiO 2 shows a high activity in the reaction between CO 2 and H 2 to yield CO. On the contrary, when Rh is reduced to a metallic state, the activity is low and the main product is not CO but CH 4 .This phenomenon can be expressed from the differences in the ability of H 2 dissociation.When Rh is in a partially reduced state, the H 2 dissociation ability of the Rh is suppressed at a suitable degree.When Rh is fully reduced to a metallic state, the H 2 dissociation ability is too strong, and the dissociated hydrogen not only accepts the positive hole but also reacts with negatively charged CO A 2 to hydrogenate it.If the hydrogenation of CO A 2 is completed, the product CH 4 will be released to the gas phase; however, it is suggested that the CO A 2 is not easily hydrogenated to CH 4 but remains on the surface as a form of CH x , because when Rh is fully reduced, the amount of CH 4 is small while the evolution of CO remarkably decreases.This excessive hydrogenation reaction cannot proceed via CO as an intermediate because CO and H 2 did not react on Rh/TiO 2 under irradiation at room temperature. According to the above view, however, the difference of Ru and Rh in the selectivity in CO 2 H 2 reaction cannot be explained.In addition, one cannot illustrate the reason why the highly reduced Ru/TiO 2 does not exhibit higher activity in CH 4 production than partially reduced one.From this, it should be concluded that the oxide state plays an important role as a promoter in some steps of the reaction.Although it is not clear in which step the oxide state works effectively, it may assist the redox reaction between CO 2 and H 2 by changing its oxidation state. Fig. 1 shows the result of CO 2 H 2 reaction under irradiation of several parts of wavelengths, as well as in the dark.It is noteworthy that CO is yielded as a main product of CO 2 reduction even in the dark.CO is an unreasonable product considering the thermodynamic equilibrium of the reverse water-gas shift reaction CO 2 g H 2 g 3 CO g H 2 O gY AG 28X6 kJamol at 298X15 K at room temperature (or at 323 K).This contradiction indicates the removal of one (or two) product(s) which causes the shift of the equilibrium to the right. It is thought that the surface of TiO 2 is highly dehydrated after the evacuation at high temperature in the pretreatment.Hence, signicant amount of surface hydroxyl group can be produced newly on TiO 2 .As H 2 directly forms surface hydroxyl group during the CO 2 H 2 reaction according to the reaction mechanism we proposed in the previous section, it is thought that H 2 O need not be released into the gas phase in the dark reaction for a while. The amount of CO increased from 3.4 to 5.1 mmol when the reaction time was extended from 6 to 24 h in the dark at 323 K.However, the reaction rate is small compared to the case under irradiation.Therefore we have claimed that the reaction is a photo-enhanced reaction'' as Thampi et al. 12,13 previously declared.It should be noted that the dark reactions were performed at 323 K.This temperature is rather higher than the temperature of the reaction system under irradiation.Hence, the amount of CO produced in the dark may be less than 3.4 mmol for 6 h reaction.When the Y-45 optical lter was put to use (i.e., the light with wavelength longer than 450 nm was irradiated), the amount of CO was only 1.4 mmol even under irradiation, although the tempera-ture of the reactor was not very different from each other under irradiation using any optical lter.Thus the value of 1.4 mmol is to be considered as the contribution of the CO evolution by the dark reaction under photoirradiation, since the light with wavelength longer than 450 nm does not contribute to the excitation of TiO 2 .From this, the amount of CO by pure photoreaction should be 7.8 mmol for 6 h reaction, because the total amount of evolved CO is 9.2 mmol and the amount of CO produced by the dark reaction is 1.4 mmol.Therefore, the ratio of the production of CO by the dark reaction to that of the photoreaction under irradiation without any lter is calculated to be only 18. As depicted in Fig. 2, we can understand that CO is once yielded at the earlier stage of the reaction, but removed from the gas phase afterwards.It suggests that CO is adsorbed to Rh/TiO 2 or converted to other compounds.Between these two possibilities, the former one (i.e., simple adsorption process) should be excluded.If the adsorption was the main reason, a part of produced CO might have immediately been adsorbed on Rh/TiO 2 after its production, and the other part might have been released to the gas phase since the rate of CO adsorption was thought to be enough fast.Therefore the amount of CO might increase monotonously.In practice, however, the amount of CO in the gas phase decreased after reaching the maximum amount.Hence the simple adsorption should not be the reason of this peculiar behavior.This leads us to the conclusion that CO is converted to other compounds during the long period of reaction. Many investigators have reported that Rh forms rhodium carbonyl clusters under CO atmosphere 25.Considering that, we prospected the formation of Rh m (CO) n species during the photoreaction because in later part of the photoreaction the Rh/TiO 2 sample is surrounded with gaseous CO produced in the reaction.The conversion of Rh into Rh m (CO) n species can also be the reason of the decrease in the activity towards CO production.Accordingly, the rapid decrease of gaseous CO after long time irradiation can be successfully explained: the rapid decrease of CO is brought about both by the reaction between Rh and CO, and by the decline of the production of CO. The formation of Rh m (CO) n is supported by the desorbed gases by heat treatment at 573 K after photoreaction.The main component of the desorbed gases by heat treatment was CO.This indicates that more amount of CO exists on the surface of Rh/TiO 2 , although it is not clear in which form they exist on the surface.However, taking it into consideration that the Rh m (CO) n species was decomposed at temperature up to ca. 573 K 26, the carbonyl cluster is one of the candidates of the compounds formed during photoreaction on the surface.Furthermore, the XANES spectrum of Rh/TiO 2 also suggests the change of the state of Rh before and after photoreaction.The XANES spectra of Rh(1)/TiO 2 and Rh(4)/TiO 2 after photoreaction and their simulation spectra using those of reference compounds are shown in Fig. 7.A good tting result was achieved in the case of Rh(4)/TiO 2 (Fig. 7(a)), while in Rh(1)/TiO 2 the tting with the spectra of Rh foil and Rh 2 O 3 as the reference compounds did not get along well.Taking into account that the spectrum of Rh(1)/ TiO 2 before photoreaction could be t with those of the reference compounds, we concluded that another chemical species than a metal or an oxide formed on Rh(1)/TiO 2 during the photoreaction.It is supposed that the other species is the compound made of Rh and CO.Therefore, we tried to simulate the XANES of Rh(1)/TiO 2 after photoreaction using the spectrum of Rh(CO) 2 Cl 2 along with Rh foil and Rh 2 O 3 .The result was a little better than that without Rh(CO) 2 Cl 2 as shown in Fig. 7(b).This suggests the formation of rhodium carbonyl compounds in a sense.However, we should not establish the existence of the compounds simply because of the success in the simulation of XANES spectrum by Rh(CO) 2 Cl 2 .It is only a reinforcement of the hypothesis and the speculation. The above results are, of course, not enough for the evidences pointing out that rhodium carbonyl compounds form on Rh/TiO 2 .However, it is certain that the compound to which CO is converted does not relate to the reaction path of CO 2 photoreduction by H 2 : the compound is yielded after the production of CO from CO 2 and H 2 .Therefore, if we can remove CO from the reactor by some chemical engineering methods, the photoreaction possibly proceeds continuously because the change in the state of Rh can be avoided."}], "light source": [{"llm generation": "UV-Vis", "source": "A 500 W ultrahigh-pressure mercury lamp was used as the light source, and the reactor was illuminated from the bottom.", "context": "The Rh/TiO 2 samples used in this study were prepared by a simple impregnation method.First, TiO 2 supplied from Japan Catalysis Society (JRC-TIO-4) was impregnated with an aqueous solution of RhCl 3 A3H 2 O (Wako Chemical).It was then evaporated to dryness in a water bath at 353 K.After the obtained solid was dried at 373 K overnight, it was calcined at 773 K for 5 h.The loading amount of Rh was varied from 0.3 to 4 wt as metal.Hereafter, Rh(X)/TiO 2 denotes the sample containing X wt of Rh.The XRD pattern showed no peak assignable to Rh crystals in every Rh/TiO 2 sample.The BET specic surface areas of the samples were almost the same (50.1 m 2 /g for Rh(1)/TiO 2 , and 50.3 m 2 /g for Rh(4)/TiO 2 ), indicating that the Rh loading had no in uence on the surface area of the sample. The photoreaction was carried out in a closed static system connected to a vacuum line in a similar manner described elsewhere 17.A Rh/TiO 2 sample weighed 0.3 g was spread on the at bottom of a quartz reactor.Before photoreaction, the sample was heated at 673 K for 30 min in the air and evacuated for 30 min at the same temperature, followed by treatment with 8 kPa O 2 for 60 min and evacuation for 30 min at 673 K.After that, the temperature was lowered to 523 K, and the sample was treated with 8 kPa H 2 for 120 min followed by evacuation for 30 min at 523 K.After the above pretreatment, the sample was cooled to room temperature, and a mixture of CO 2 (150 mmol) and H 2 (50 mmol) was admitted to the reactor unless otherwise noted.The total pressure in the reactor was ca. 25 kPa.A 500 W ultrahigh-pressure mercury lamp was used as the light source, and the reactor was illuminated from the bottom.The area subjected to illumination was 12 cm 2 .When the short wavelength part of irradiation light required to be cut-off, a series of glass lters (Toshiba UV-29, UV-37 and Y-45, which permitted 50 transmission of lights at the wavelength 290, 370 and 450 nm, respectively) was placed between the mercury lamp and the reactor.After photoreaction for 6 h, the gaseous products were analyzed.In some cases, after 2 min evacuation at room temperature following to the photoreaction, the sample was heated at 573 K for 20 min, and the desorbed gases were also analyzed.To avoid the reaction between desorbed gases, they were trapped by the adsorption to a high surface area SiO 2 kept at 77 K.The analysis of products was performed with an on-line TCD gas chromatograph (Shimadzu GC-8A) equipped with Molecular Sieve 5A packed column using argon as a carrier gas, which could detect H 2 , CH 4 , and CO. X-ray absorption (XAS) experiments were carried out on the beam line BL-10B at Photon Factory in the High Energy Accelerator Research Organization, Tsukuba, Japan (proposal no.93G170).All spectra were recorded using an in situ cell in a transmission mode at room temperature with an Si(3 1 1) two-crystal channel-cut monochromator. Data analysis was performed using a FACOM M1800 computer of Kyoto University Data Processing Center.Normalization of XANES spectra and data reduction of EXAFS were carried out as described elsewhere 18. We tried to reduce CO 2 by H 2 on Rh(1)/TiO 2 under photoirradiation.After 6 h irradiation, 9.2 mmol of CO and a small amount (0.1 mmol) of CH 4 were produced.Any other products such as hydrocarbons or oxygenates were not detected.The activity was very high compared to those reported by us previously using the same reaction system with ZrO 2 samples 19,20.When only CO 2 was introduced and no H 2 was admitted to the reactor, no product was detected even after photoirradiation.On the contrary, when only H 2 (i.e., no CO 2 ) was introduced, the evolution of CH 4 was observed.This indicates that there are some carbon residues on the Rh/TiO 2 sample.However, the amount of CH 4 was too small (0.05 mmol).From these results, we concluded that the CO obtained here comes from CO 2 , and that this reaction is a reduction of CO 2 by H 2 . The dependence of the reaction on the wavelength of irradiation light was investigated by cutting off a part of the wavelength region of the irradiation light by a series of optical glass lters.Apparently, the activity towards CO production decreased when the irradiation light was ltered on the longer wavelength as shown in Fig. 1.Since the temperature of the reactor was not so different from each other between the case with or without any optical lters, the change in the activity observed here may be due to the change in the wavelength of light rather than in the heat supplied by irradiated light.This result leads us to the conclusion that some photochemical processes are included in this reaction.However, it is not a pure photoreaction because signicant amount of CO was produced even when no irradiation was supplied with the reactor slightly temperature-elevated in the water bath (323 K).The amount of CO production in the dark was larger than that with a glass lter cutting !370 nm or !450 nm.This is not surprising considering that the temperature of the reactor was lower than 323 K under photoirradiation.From these results, we claim that the CO 2 reduction by H 2 on Rh/TiO 2 is a photoenhanced reaction similar to the concept suggested with Ru loaded TiO 2 12,13.Fig. 2 shows the time course of CO production over Rh(1)/TiO 2 under continuous photoirradiation.In the earlier stage of photoreaction, the amount of CO naturally increased with time; however, the increase stopped about 10 h after the photoirradiation started.On the contrary, the decrease in the amount of CO which ought to be once produced was observed.Along with the decrease of CO, the increase of CH 4 production was indeed observed, but the amount of produced CH 4 was far smaller than that of CO decrease.For this reason we cannot assume that CO is converted to CH 4 by hydrogenation during the long irradiation.As a consequence, it must be hypothesized that the Rh/ TiO 2 absorbed the CO.Detailed discussion will be found in the following section. As described in Section 2, the Rh/TiO 2 sample was reduced by H 2 at 523 K after the oxidization by O 2 at 673 K as a pretreatment before photoreactions.We investigated the effect of H 2 reduction of the Rh/TiO 2 sample in the pretreatment by varying the temperature of H 2 treatment on the Rh(1)/TiO 2 .The result is shown in Fig. 3. From this, we can notice that the increase in the reduction temperature above 523 K brings about the drastic decrease in the activity towards CO production.On the other hand, CH 4 production slightly increases when the reduction temperature increases.It suggests that the oxidation state of Rh in Rh(1)/TiO 2 sample controls the selectivity of CO 2 H 2 photoreaction as well as the activity of the reaction.In a word, it seems that when Rh remains oxidized in a proper degree, the activity towards CO production is high.However, when no H 2 treatment was given (i.e., Rh was in a fully oxidized state), the activity was very low either towards CO or CH 4 production: the amount of yielded CO and CH 4 were only 0.2 and 0.1 mmol, respectively.From this, the following ideas are implied: (1) when Rh in Rh/TiO 2 is moderately reduced, the Rh/TiO 2 sample shows the highest activity towards CO production, and (2) as Rh in Rh/TiO 2 is reduced excessively, the product selectivity shifts from CO to CH 4 along with the decrease in the activity. We investigated the effect of the loading amount of Rh on the reaction activity and selectivity with the temperature of H 2 reduction treatment xed to 523 K. Fig. 4 shows the amount of yielded CO and CH 4 over Rh/TiO 2 samples with various amounts of Rh loading after 6 h irradiation.The increase in Rh loading resulted in the decrease in CO evolution.When the amount of Rh increased, thermodynamically preferable CH 4 was yielded rather than CO, although the absolute amount of CH 4 evolution was small.The effect of an increase in the loading amount of Rh seems similar to that of the reductions at higher temperature than 523 K on Rh(1)/TiO 2 .From this, it is assumed that the variation of the loading amount causes the change of the state of Rh on TiO 2 .When the amount of Rh loading is low, Rh may be in a moderately reduced state on the surface of TiO 2 and assist to produce CO. To clarify the assumption mentioned above, we recorded the Rh K-edge X-ray absorption spectra and elucidated the state of Rh on various Rh(X)/TiO 2 (X0.54) samples after pretreatment.Fig. 5(A) shows the Rh K-edge XANES spectra of Rh/ TiO 2 sample with various amounts of Rh loading together with those of Rh foil and Rh 2 O 3 as references.Looking at the series of the spectra, we can see that the shape of the spectrum of Rh(4)/TiO 2 is similar to that of Rh foil, and that the shape of the spectra changes gradually to that of rhodium oxide with the increase of loaded Rh. There have been reports concerning that the XANES spectrum of a sample containing an element in a mixture of different states can be simulated by the linear combination of the spectra of reference compounds corresponding to each oxidation state 21,22.So we also tried to reproduce the XANES spectra of the Rh/TiO 2 samples by the superposition of the spectra of reference compounds with a suitable ratio.Fig. 6 shows the original XANES spectra of the samples with the simulated ones using Rh 2 O 3 and Rh foil as reference compounds.This clearly indicates that the increase in the Rh loading is responsible for the growth of Rh in a metallic state.It is also shown that even the Rh(0.5)/TiO 2 sample contains 35 of metal. On the other hand, Fourier-transforms of k 3 -weighted Rh K-edge EXAFS spectra of the Rh/TiO 2 samples and reference compounds mentioned above are shown in Fig. 5(B).While the peak at around 2.4 A E assigned to metallic RhRh bond is very weak in Rh(0.5)/TiO 2 , it is enhanced together with the increase in the amount of loaded Rh.The peak at around 1.6 A E is assigned to RhO bond, and the intensity of the peak decreases as the amount of Rh increases.The sample richest in Rh, Rh(4)/TiO 2 , shows almost no peak at around 1.6 A E . From the above-mentioned results obtained by the XAS experiments, we concluded that the highly active sample for the CO 2 H 2 photoreaction keeps Rh in a state of the mixture of metal and oxide.The state of Rh involves the selectivity of products also: the more the Rh is reduced, the more is CH 4 produced rather than CO.The former notion is again very similar to that proposed by Thampi et al. 12,13 with Ru/ TiO 2 sample. As described above, the reaction between CO 2 and H 2 over Rh/TiO 2 is enhanced by irradiation.We suppose that the light is absorbed by TiO 2 rather than Rh because no reaction proceeded when Rh/SiO 2 is used instead of Rh/ TiO 2 .Probably the light generates a pair of an excited electron and a positive hole in TiO 2 .The electron moves to Rh to be injected into CO 2 adsorbed on Rh, and the CO 2 is activated to become CO A 2 .This process has been proposed in the literature 15.On the other hand, H 2 is adsorbed on Rh dissociatively, and the dissociated hydrogen may migrate onto TiO 2 surface to react with the positive hole.This process results in the formation of H , which may be bound with an oxygen of TiO 2 to form surface hydroxyl group.In such a way the charge will be separated effectively. As the possibility of the evolution of CO from CO A 2 , the following reaction has been proposed on K-promoted Rh metal surface 23: That is, the disproportionation reaction of two CO A 2 anion radicals into CO and carbonate.As the carbonate species will exist in a stable form on TiO 2 surface, the migration of CO 2A 3 species to TiO 2 surface will further help the above disproportionation reaction. However, it should be kept in mind that there is a possibility of the CO production via any intermediate such as a formate ion.The CO A 2 radical is thought to be more reactive with hydrogen than a neutral CO 2 , and the most plausible product in the rst step of CO 2 hydrogenation is the formate ion.The formation of the formate ion from CO 2 and H 2 in a thermal reaction on supported Rh has already been reported 24.The formate is known to decompose rather easily to yield CO. Since the evolution of CO was practically observed on Rh/TiO 2 under irradiation using formic acid together with H 2 as a reactant, we guess that this mechanism is preferable to that explained from the disproportionation of CO A 2 radical. We have found that when Rh is in a partially reduced state, Rh/TiO 2 shows a high activity in the reaction between CO 2 and H 2 to yield CO. On the contrary, when Rh is reduced to a metallic state, the activity is low and the main product is not CO but CH 4 .This phenomenon can be expressed from the differences in the ability of H 2 dissociation.When Rh is in a partially reduced state, the H 2 dissociation ability of the Rh is suppressed at a suitable degree.When Rh is fully reduced to a metallic state, the H 2 dissociation ability is too strong, and the dissociated hydrogen not only accepts the positive hole but also reacts with negatively charged CO A 2 to hydrogenate it.If the hydrogenation of CO A 2 is completed, the product CH 4 will be released to the gas phase; however, it is suggested that the CO A 2 is not easily hydrogenated to CH 4 but remains on the surface as a form of CH x , because when Rh is fully reduced, the amount of CH 4 is small while the evolution of CO remarkably decreases.This excessive hydrogenation reaction cannot proceed via CO as an intermediate because CO and H 2 did not react on Rh/TiO 2 under irradiation at room temperature. According to the above view, however, the difference of Ru and Rh in the selectivity in CO 2 H 2 reaction cannot be explained.In addition, one cannot illustrate the reason why the highly reduced Ru/TiO 2 does not exhibit higher activity in CH 4 production than partially reduced one.From this, it should be concluded that the oxide state plays an important role as a promoter in some steps of the reaction.Although it is not clear in which step the oxide state works effectively, it may assist the redox reaction between CO 2 and H 2 by changing its oxidation state. Fig. 1 shows the result of CO 2 H 2 reaction under irradiation of several parts of wavelengths, as well as in the dark.It is noteworthy that CO is yielded as a main product of CO 2 reduction even in the dark.CO is an unreasonable product considering the thermodynamic equilibrium of the reverse water-gas shift reaction CO 2 g H 2 g 3 CO g H 2 O gY AG 28X6 kJamol at 298X15 K at room temperature (or at 323 K).This contradiction indicates the removal of one (or two) product(s) which causes the shift of the equilibrium to the right. It is thought that the surface of TiO 2 is highly dehydrated after the evacuation at high temperature in the pretreatment.Hence, signicant amount of surface hydroxyl group can be produced newly on TiO 2 .As H 2 directly forms surface hydroxyl group during the CO 2 H 2 reaction according to the reaction mechanism we proposed in the previous section, it is thought that H 2 O need not be released into the gas phase in the dark reaction for a while. The amount of CO increased from 3.4 to 5.1 mmol when the reaction time was extended from 6 to 24 h in the dark at 323 K.However, the reaction rate is small compared to the case under irradiation.Therefore we have claimed that the reaction is a photo-enhanced reaction'' as Thampi et al. 12,13 previously declared.It should be noted that the dark reactions were performed at 323 K.This temperature is rather higher than the temperature of the reaction system under irradiation.Hence, the amount of CO produced in the dark may be less than 3.4 mmol for 6 h reaction.When the Y-45 optical lter was put to use (i.e., the light with wavelength longer than 450 nm was irradiated), the amount of CO was only 1.4 mmol even under irradiation, although the tempera-ture of the reactor was not very different from each other under irradiation using any optical lter.Thus the value of 1.4 mmol is to be considered as the contribution of the CO evolution by the dark reaction under photoirradiation, since the light with wavelength longer than 450 nm does not contribute to the excitation of TiO 2 .From this, the amount of CO by pure photoreaction should be 7.8 mmol for 6 h reaction, because the total amount of evolved CO is 9.2 mmol and the amount of CO produced by the dark reaction is 1.4 mmol.Therefore, the ratio of the production of CO by the dark reaction to that of the photoreaction under irradiation without any lter is calculated to be only 18. As depicted in Fig. 2, we can understand that CO is once yielded at the earlier stage of the reaction, but removed from the gas phase afterwards.It suggests that CO is adsorbed to Rh/TiO 2 or converted to other compounds.Between these two possibilities, the former one (i.e., simple adsorption process) should be excluded.If the adsorption was the main reason, a part of produced CO might have immediately been adsorbed on Rh/TiO 2 after its production, and the other part might have been released to the gas phase since the rate of CO adsorption was thought to be enough fast.Therefore the amount of CO might increase monotonously.In practice, however, the amount of CO in the gas phase decreased after reaching the maximum amount.Hence the simple adsorption should not be the reason of this peculiar behavior.This leads us to the conclusion that CO is converted to other compounds during the long period of reaction. Many investigators have reported that Rh forms rhodium carbonyl clusters under CO atmosphere 25.Considering that, we prospected the formation of Rh m (CO) n species during the photoreaction because in later part of the photoreaction the Rh/TiO 2 sample is surrounded with gaseous CO produced in the reaction.The conversion of Rh into Rh m (CO) n species can also be the reason of the decrease in the activity towards CO production.Accordingly, the rapid decrease of gaseous CO after long time irradiation can be successfully explained: the rapid decrease of CO is brought about both by the reaction between Rh and CO, and by the decline of the production of CO. The formation of Rh m (CO) n is supported by the desorbed gases by heat treatment at 573 K after photoreaction.The main component of the desorbed gases by heat treatment was CO.This indicates that more amount of CO exists on the surface of Rh/TiO 2 , although it is not clear in which form they exist on the surface.However, taking it into consideration that the Rh m (CO) n species was decomposed at temperature up to ca. 573 K 26, the carbonyl cluster is one of the candidates of the compounds formed during photoreaction on the surface.Furthermore, the XANES spectrum of Rh/TiO 2 also suggests the change of the state of Rh before and after photoreaction.The XANES spectra of Rh(1)/TiO 2 and Rh(4)/TiO 2 after photoreaction and their simulation spectra using those of reference compounds are shown in Fig. 7.A good tting result was achieved in the case of Rh(4)/TiO 2 (Fig. 7(a)), while in Rh(1)/TiO 2 the tting with the spectra of Rh foil and Rh 2 O 3 as the reference compounds did not get along well.Taking into account that the spectrum of Rh(1)/ TiO 2 before photoreaction could be t with those of the reference compounds, we concluded that another chemical species than a metal or an oxide formed on Rh(1)/TiO 2 during the photoreaction.It is supposed that the other species is the compound made of Rh and CO.Therefore, we tried to simulate the XANES of Rh(1)/TiO 2 after photoreaction using the spectrum of Rh(CO) 2 Cl 2 along with Rh foil and Rh 2 O 3 .The result was a little better than that without Rh(CO) 2 Cl 2 as shown in Fig. 7(b).This suggests the formation of rhodium carbonyl compounds in a sense.However, we should not establish the existence of the compounds simply because of the success in the simulation of XANES spectrum by Rh(CO) 2 Cl 2 .It is only a reinforcement of the hypothesis and the speculation. The above results are, of course, not enough for the evidences pointing out that rhodium carbonyl compounds form on Rh/TiO 2 .However, it is certain that the compound to which CO is converted does not relate to the reaction path of CO 2 photoreduction by H 2 : the compound is yielded after the production of CO from CO 2 and H 2 .Therefore, if we can remove CO from the reactor by some chemical engineering methods, the photoreaction possibly proceeds continuously because the change in the state of Rh can be avoided. Rh-loading TiO 2 is found to show high activity towards photoreduction of CO 2 by H 2 under mild condition of low pressure and room temperature.When Rh on TiO 2 is in a mixture of metal and oxide, the high activity towards CO 2 photoreduction by H 2 to CO is observed.When Rh is fully reduced, the activity is drastically lowered in addition to the change of the main product from CO to CH 4 .This change can be explained by the suppression in the H 2 dissociation ability by Rh in an oxide state as well as the effect of the oxide state as a promoter.The deactivation of the sample and the decrease of once produced CO during a long period of reaction are both illustrated from the formation of rhodium carbonyl compounds from Rh and CO.

The photoreaction was carried out in a closed static system connected to a vacuum line in a similar manner described elsewhere 17.A Rh/TiO 2 sample weighed 0.3 g was spread on the at bottom of a quartz reactor.Before photoreaction, the sample was heated at 673 K for 30 min in the air and evacuated for 30 min at the same temperature, followed by treatment with 8 kPa O 2 for 60 min and evacuation for 30 min at 673 K.After that, the temperature was lowered to 523 K, and the sample was treated with 8 kPa H 2 for 120 min followed by evacuation for 30 min at 523 K.After the above pretreatment, the sample was cooled to room temperature, and a mixture of CO 2 (150 mmol) and H 2 (50 mmol) was admitted to the reactor unless otherwise noted.The total pressure in the reactor was ca. 25 kPa.A 500 W ultrahigh-pressure mercury lamp was used as the light source, and the reactor was illuminated from the bottom.The area subjected to illumination was 12 cm 2 .When the short wavelength part of irradiation light required to be cut-off, a series of glass lters (Toshiba UV-29, UV-37 and Y-45, which permitted 50 transmission of lights at the wavelength 290, 370 and 450 nm, respectively) was placed between the mercury lamp and the reactor.After photoreaction for 6 h, the gaseous products were analyzed.In some cases, after 2 min evacuation at room temperature following to the photoreaction, the sample was heated at 573 K for 20 min, and the desorbed gases were also analyzed.To avoid the reaction between desorbed gases, they were trapped by the adsorption to a high surface area SiO 2 kept at 77 K.The analysis of products was performed with an on-line TCD gas chromatograph (Shimadzu GC-8A) equipped with Molecular Sieve 5A packed column using argon as a carrier gas, which could detect H 2 , CH 4 , and CO. X-ray absorption (XAS) experiments were carried out on the beam line BL-10B at Photon Factory in the High Energy Accelerator Research Organization, Tsukuba, Japan (proposal no.93G170).All spectra were recorded using an in situ cell in a transmission mode at room temperature with an Si(3 1 1) two-crystal channel-cut monochromator. Data analysis was performed using a FACOM M1800 computer of Kyoto University Data Processing Center.Normalization of XANES spectra and data reduction of EXAFS were carried out as described elsewhere 18. We tried to reduce CO 2 by H 2 on Rh(1)/TiO 2 under photoirradiation.After 6 h irradiation, 9.2 mmol of CO and a small amount (0.1 mmol) of CH 4 were produced.Any other products such as hydrocarbons or oxygenates were not detected.The activity was very high compared to those reported by us previously using the same reaction system with ZrO 2 samples 19,20.When only CO 2 was introduced and no H 2 was admitted to the reactor, no product was detected even after photoirradiation.On the contrary, when only H 2 (i.e., no CO 2 ) was introduced, the evolution of CH 4 was observed.This indicates that there are some carbon residues on the Rh/TiO 2 sample.However, the amount of CH 4 was too small (0.05 mmol).From these results, we concluded that the CO obtained here comes from CO 2 , and that this reaction is a reduction of CO 2 by H 2 . The dependence of the reaction on the wavelength of irradiation light was investigated by cutting off a part of the wavelength region of the irradiation light by a series of optical glass lters.Apparently, the activity towards CO production decreased when the irradiation light was ltered on the longer wavelength as shown in Fig. 1.Since the temperature of the reactor was not so different from each other between the case with or without any optical lters, the change in the activity observed here may be due to the change in the wavelength of light rather than in the heat supplied by irradiated light.This result leads us to the conclusion that some photochemical processes are included in this reaction.However, it is not a pure photoreaction because signicant amount of CO was produced even when no irradiation was supplied with the reactor slightly temperature-elevated in the water bath (323 K).The amount of CO production in the dark was larger than that with a glass lter cutting !370 nm or !450 nm.This is not surprising considering that the temperature of the reactor was lower than 323 K under photoirradiation.From these results, we claim that the CO 2 reduction by H 2 on Rh/TiO 2 is a photoenhanced reaction similar to the concept suggested with Ru loaded TiO 2 12,13.Fig. 2 shows the time course of CO production over Rh(1)/TiO 2 under continuous photoirradiation.In the earlier stage of photoreaction, the amount of CO naturally increased with time; however, the increase stopped about 10 h after the photoirradiation started.On the contrary, the decrease in the amount of CO which ought to be once produced was observed.Along with the decrease of CO, the increase of CH 4 production was indeed observed, but the amount of produced CH 4 was far smaller than that of CO decrease.For this reason we cannot assume that CO is converted to CH 4 by hydrogenation during the long irradiation.As a consequence, it must be hypothesized that the Rh/ TiO 2 absorbed the CO.Detailed discussion will be found in the following section. As described in Section 2, the Rh/TiO 2 sample was reduced by H 2 at 523 K after the oxidization by O 2 at 673 K as a pretreatment before photoreactions.We investigated the effect of H 2 reduction of the Rh/TiO 2 sample in the pretreatment by varying the temperature of H 2 treatment on the Rh(1)/TiO 2 .The result is shown in Fig. 3. From this, we can notice that the increase in the reduction temperature above 523 K brings about the drastic decrease in the activity towards CO production.On the other hand, CH 4 production slightly increases when the reduction temperature increases.It suggests that the oxidation state of Rh in Rh(1)/TiO 2 sample controls the selectivity of CO 2 H 2 photoreaction as well as the activity of the reaction.In a word, it seems that when Rh remains oxidized in a proper degree, the activity towards CO production is high.However, when no H 2 treatment was given (i.e., Rh was in a fully oxidized state), the activity was very low either towards CO or CH 4 production: the amount of yielded CO and CH 4 were only 0.2 and 0.1 mmol, respectively.From this, the following ideas are implied: (1) when Rh in Rh/TiO 2 is moderately reduced, the Rh/TiO 2 sample shows the highest activity towards CO production, and (2) as Rh in Rh/TiO 2 is reduced excessively, the product selectivity shifts from CO to CH 4 along with the decrease in the activity. We investigated the effect of the loading amount of Rh on the reaction activity and selectivity with the temperature of H 2 reduction treatment xed to 523 K. Fig. 4 shows the amount of yielded CO and CH 4 over Rh/TiO 2 samples with various amounts of Rh loading after 6 h irradiation.The increase in Rh loading resulted in the decrease in CO evolution.When the amount of Rh increased, thermodynamically preferable CH 4 was yielded rather than CO, although the absolute amount of CH 4 evolution was small.The effect of an increase in the loading amount of Rh seems similar to that of the reductions at higher temperature than 523 K on Rh(1)/TiO 2 .From this, it is assumed that the variation of the loading amount causes the change of the state of Rh on TiO 2 .When the amount of Rh loading is low, Rh may be in a moderately reduced state on the surface of TiO 2 and assist to produce CO. To clarify the assumption mentioned above, we recorded the Rh K-edge X-ray absorption spectra and elucidated the state of Rh on various Rh(X)/TiO 2 (X0.54) samples after pretreatment.Fig. 5(A) shows the Rh K-edge XANES spectra of Rh/ TiO 2 sample with various amounts of Rh loading together with those of Rh foil and Rh 2 O 3 as references.Looking at the series of the spectra, we can see that the shape of the spectrum of Rh(4)/TiO 2 is similar to that of Rh foil, and that the shape of the spectra changes gradually to that of rhodium oxide with the increase of loaded Rh. There have been reports concerning that the XANES spectrum of a sample containing an element in a mixture of different states can be simulated by the linear combination of the spectra of reference compounds corresponding to each oxidation state 21,22.So we also tried to reproduce the XANES spectra of the Rh/TiO 2 samples by the superposition of the spectra of reference compounds with a suitable ratio.Fig. 6 shows the original XANES spectra of the samples with the simulated ones using Rh 2 O 3 and Rh foil as reference compounds.This clearly indicates that the increase in the Rh loading is responsible for the growth of Rh in a metallic state.It is also shown that even the Rh(0.5)/TiO 2 sample contains 35 of metal. On the other hand, Fourier-transforms of k 3 -weighted Rh K-edge EXAFS spectra of the Rh/TiO 2 samples and reference compounds mentioned above are shown in Fig. 5(B).While the peak at around 2.4 A E assigned to metallic RhRh bond is very weak in Rh(0.5)/TiO 2 , it is enhanced together with the increase in the amount of loaded Rh.The peak at around 1.6 A E is assigned to RhO bond, and the intensity of the peak decreases as the amount of Rh increases.The sample richest in Rh, Rh(4)/TiO 2 , shows almost no peak at around 1.6 A E . From the above-mentioned results obtained by the XAS experiments, we concluded that the highly active sample for the CO 2 H 2 photoreaction keeps Rh in a state of the mixture of metal and oxide.The state of Rh involves the selectivity of products also: the more the Rh is reduced, the more is CH 4 produced rather than CO.The former notion is again very similar to that proposed by Thampi et al. 12,13 with Ru/ TiO 2 sample. As described above, the reaction between CO 2 and H 2 over Rh/TiO 2 is enhanced by irradiation.We suppose that the light is absorbed by TiO 2 rather than Rh because no reaction proceeded when Rh/SiO 2 is used instead of Rh/ TiO 2 .Probably the light generates a pair of an excited electron and a positive hole in TiO 2 .The electron moves to Rh to be injected into CO 2 adsorbed on Rh, and the CO 2 is activated to become CO A 2 .This process has been proposed in the literature 15.On the other hand, H 2 is adsorbed on Rh dissociatively, and the dissociated hydrogen may migrate onto TiO 2 surface to react with the positive hole.This process results in the formation of H , which may be bound with an oxygen of TiO 2 to form surface hydroxyl group.In such a way the charge will be separated effectively. As the possibility of the evolution of CO from CO A 2 , the following reaction has been proposed on K-promoted Rh metal surface 23: That is, the disproportionation reaction of two CO A 2 anion radicals into CO and carbonate.As the carbonate species will exist in a stable form on TiO 2 surface, the migration of CO 2A 3 species to TiO 2 surface will further help the above disproportionation reaction. However, it should be kept in mind that there is a possibility of the CO production via any intermediate such as a formate ion.The CO A 2 radical is thought to be more reactive with hydrogen than a neutral CO 2 , and the most plausible product in the rst step of CO 2 hydrogenation is the formate ion.The formation of the formate ion from CO 2 and H 2 in a thermal reaction on supported Rh has already been reported 24.The formate is known to decompose rather easily to yield CO. Since the evolution of CO was practically observed on Rh/TiO 2 under irradiation using formic acid together with H 2 as a reactant, we guess that this mechanism is preferable to that explained from the disproportionation of CO A 2 radical. We have found that when Rh is in a partially reduced state, Rh/TiO 2 shows a high activity in the reaction between CO 2 and H 2 to yield CO. On the contrary, when Rh is reduced to a metallic state, the activity is low and the main product is not CO but CH 4 .This phenomenon can be expressed from the differences in the ability of H 2 dissociation.When Rh is in a partially reduced state, the H 2 dissociation ability of the Rh is suppressed at a suitable degree.When Rh is fully reduced to a metallic state, the H 2 dissociation ability is too strong, and the dissociated hydrogen not only accepts the positive hole but also reacts with negatively charged CO A 2 to hydrogenate it.If the hydrogenation of CO A 2 is completed, the product CH 4 will be released to the gas phase; however, it is suggested that the CO A 2 is not easily hydrogenated to CH 4 but remains on the surface as a form of CH x , because when Rh is fully reduced, the amount of CH 4 is small while the evolution of CO remarkably decreases.This excessive hydrogenation reaction cannot proceed via CO as an intermediate because CO and H 2 did not react on Rh/TiO 2 under irradiation at room temperature. According to the above view, however, the difference of Ru and Rh in the selectivity in CO 2 H 2 reaction cannot be explained.In addition, one cannot illustrate the reason why the highly reduced Ru/TiO 2 does not exhibit higher activity in CH 4 production than partially reduced one.From this, it should be concluded that the oxide state plays an important role as a promoter in some steps of the reaction.Although it is not clear in which step the oxide state works effectively, it may assist the redox reaction between CO 2 and H 2 by changing its oxidation state. Fig. 1 shows the result of CO 2 H 2 reaction under irradiation of several parts of wavelengths, as well as in the dark.It is noteworthy that CO is yielded as a main product of CO 2 reduction even in the dark.CO is an unreasonable product considering the thermodynamic equilibrium of the reverse water-gas shift reaction CO 2 g H 2 g 3 CO g H 2 O gY AG 28X6 kJamol at 298X15 K at room temperature (or at 323 K).This contradiction indicates the removal of one (or two) product(s) which causes the shift of the equilibrium to the right. It is thought that the surface of TiO 2 is highly dehydrated after the evacuation at high temperature in the pretreatment.Hence, signicant amount of surface hydroxyl group can be produced newly on TiO 2 .As H 2 directly forms surface hydroxyl group during the CO 2 H 2 reaction according to the reaction mechanism we proposed in the previous section, it is thought that H 2 O need not be released into the gas phase in the dark reaction for a while. The amount of CO increased from 3.4 to 5.1 mmol when the reaction time was extended from 6 to 24 h in the dark at 323 K.However, the reaction rate is small compared to the case under irradiation.Therefore we have claimed that the reaction is a photo-enhanced reaction'' as Thampi et al. 12,13 previously declared.It should be noted that the dark reactions were performed at 323 K.This temperature is rather higher than the temperature of the reaction system under irradiation.Hence, the amount of CO produced in the dark may be less than 3.4 mmol for 6 h reaction.When the Y-45 optical lter was put to use (i.e., the light with wavelength longer than 450 nm was irradiated), the amount of CO was only 1.4 mmol even under irradiation, although the tempera-ture of the reactor was not very different from each other under irradiation using any optical lter.Thus the value of 1.4 mmol is to be considered as the contribution of the CO evolution by the dark reaction under photoirradiation, since the light with wavelength longer than 450 nm does not contribute to the excitation of TiO 2 .From this, the amount of CO by pure photoreaction should be 7.8 mmol for 6 h reaction, because the total amount of evolved CO is 9.2 mmol and the amount of CO produced by the dark reaction is 1.4 mmol.Therefore, the ratio of the production of CO by the dark reaction to that of the photoreaction under irradiation without any lter is calculated to be only 18. As depicted in Fig. 2, we can understand that CO is once yielded at the earlier stage of the reaction, but removed from the gas phase afterwards.It suggests that CO is adsorbed to Rh/TiO 2 or converted to other compounds.Between these two possibilities, the former one (i.e., simple adsorption process) should be excluded.If the adsorption was the main reason, a part of produced CO might have immediately been adsorbed on Rh/TiO 2 after its production, and the other part might have been released to the gas phase since the rate of CO adsorption was thought to be enough fast.Therefore the amount of CO might increase monotonously.In practice, however, the amount of CO in the gas phase decreased after reaching the maximum amount.Hence the simple adsorption should not be the reason of this peculiar behavior.This leads us to the conclusion that CO is converted to other compounds during the long period of reaction. Many investigators have reported that Rh forms rhodium carbonyl clusters under CO atmosphere 25.Considering that, we prospected the formation of Rh m (CO) n species during the photoreaction because in later part of the photoreaction the Rh/TiO 2 sample is surrounded with gaseous CO produced in the reaction.The conversion of Rh into Rh m (CO) n species can also be the reason of the decrease in the activity towards CO production.Accordingly, the rapid decrease of gaseous CO after long time irradiation can be successfully explained: the rapid decrease of CO is brought about both by the reaction between Rh and CO, and by the decline of the production of CO. The formation of Rh m (CO) n is supported by the desorbed gases by heat treatment at 573 K after photoreaction.The main component of the desorbed gases by heat treatment was CO.This indicates that more amount of CO exists on the surface of Rh/TiO 2 , although it is not clear in which form they exist on the surface.However, taking it into consideration that the Rh m (CO) n species was decomposed at temperature up to ca. 573 K 26, the carbonyl cluster is one of the candidates of the compounds formed during photoreaction on the surface.Furthermore, the XANES spectrum of Rh/TiO 2 also suggests the change of the state of Rh before and after photoreaction.The XANES spectra of Rh(1)/TiO 2 and Rh(4)/TiO 2 after photoreaction and their simulation spectra using those of reference compounds are shown in Fig. 7.A good tting result was achieved in the case of Rh(4)/TiO 2 (Fig. 7(a)), while in Rh(1)/TiO 2 the tting with the spectra of Rh foil and Rh 2 O 3 as the reference compounds did not get along well.Taking into account that the spectrum of Rh(1)/ TiO 2 before photoreaction could be t with those of the reference compounds, we concluded that another chemical species than a metal or an oxide formed on Rh(1)/TiO 2 during the photoreaction.It is supposed that the other species is the compound made of Rh and CO.Therefore, we tried to simulate the XANES of Rh(1)/TiO 2 after photoreaction using the spectrum of Rh(CO) 2 Cl 2 along with Rh foil and Rh 2 O 3 .The result was a little better than that without Rh(CO) 2 Cl 2 as shown in Fig. 7(b).This suggests the formation of rhodium carbonyl compounds in a sense.However, we should not establish the existence of the compounds simply because of the success in the simulation of XANES spectrum by Rh(CO) 2 Cl 2 .It is only a reinforcement of the hypothesis and the speculation. The above results are, of course, not enough for the evidences pointing out that rhodium carbonyl compounds form on Rh/TiO 2 .However, it is certain that the compound to which CO is converted does not relate to the reaction path of CO 2 photoreduction by H 2 : the compound is yielded after the production of CO from CO 2 and H 2 .Therefore, if we can remove CO from the reactor by some chemical engineering methods, the photoreaction possibly proceeds continuously because the change in the state of Rh can be avoided. Rh-loading TiO 2 is found to show high activity towards photoreduction of CO 2 by H 2 under mild condition of low pressure and room temperature.When Rh on TiO 2 is in a mixture of metal and oxide, the high activity towards CO 2 photoreduction by H 2 to CO is observed.When Rh is fully reduced, the activity is drastically lowered in addition to the change of the main product from CO to CH 4 .This change can be explained by the suppression in the H 2 dissociation ability by Rh in an oxide state as well as the effect of the oxide state as a promoter.The deactivation of the sample and the decrease of once produced CO during a long period of reaction are both illustrated from the formation of rhodium carbonyl compounds from Rh and CO.

The photoreaction was carried out in a closed static system connected to a vacuum line in a similar manner described elsewhere 17.A Rh/TiO 2 sample weighed 0.3 g was spread on the at bottom of a quartz reactor.Before photoreaction, the sample was heated at 673 K for 30 min in the air and evacuated for 30 min at the same temperature, followed by treatment with 8 kPa O 2 for 60 min and evacuation for 30 min at 673 K.After that, the temperature was lowered to 523 K, and the sample was treated with 8 kPa H 2 for 120 min followed by evacuation for 30 min at 523 K.After the above pretreatment, the sample was cooled to room temperature, and a mixture of CO 2 (150 mmol) and H 2 (50 mmol) was admitted to the reactor unless otherwise noted.The total pressure in the reactor was ca. 25 kPa.A 500 W ultrahigh-pressure mercury lamp was used as the light source, and the reactor was illuminated from the bottom.The area subjected to illumination was 12 cm 2 .When the short wavelength part of irradiation light required to be cut-off, a series of glass lters (Toshiba UV-29, UV-37 and Y-45, which permitted 50 transmission of lights at the wavelength 290, 370 and 450 nm, respectively) was placed between the mercury lamp and the reactor.After photoreaction for 6 h, the gaseous products were analyzed.In some cases, after 2 min evacuation at room temperature following to the photoreaction, the sample was heated at 573 K for 20 min, and the desorbed gases were also analyzed.To avoid the reaction between desorbed gases, they were trapped by the adsorption to a high surface area SiO 2 kept at 77 K.The analysis of products was performed with an on-line TCD gas chromatograph (Shimadzu GC-8A) equipped with Molecular Sieve 5A packed column using argon as a carrier gas, which could detect H 2 , CH 4 , and CO. X-ray absorption (XAS) experiments were carried out on the beam line BL-10B at Photon Factory in the High Energy Accelerator Research Organization, Tsukuba, Japan (proposal no.93G170).All spectra were recorded using an in situ cell in a transmission mode at room temperature with an Si(3 1 1) two-crystal channel-cut monochromator. Data analysis was performed using a FACOM M1800 computer of Kyoto University Data Processing Center.Normalization of XANES spectra and data reduction of EXAFS were carried out as described elsewhere 18. We tried to reduce CO 2 by H 2 on Rh(1)/TiO 2 under photoirradiation.After 6 h irradiation, 9.2 mmol of CO and a small amount (0.1 mmol) of CH 4 were produced.Any other products such as hydrocarbons or oxygenates were not detected.The activity was very high compared to those reported by us previously using the same reaction system with ZrO 2 samples 19,20.When only CO 2 was introduced and no H 2 was admitted to the reactor, no product was detected even after photoirradiation.On the contrary, when only H 2 (i.e., no CO 2 ) was introduced, the evolution of CH 4 was observed.This indicates that there are some carbon residues on the Rh/TiO 2 sample.However, the amount of CH 4 was too small (0.05 mmol).From these results, we concluded that the CO obtained here comes from CO 2 , and that this reaction is a reduction of CO 2 by H 2 . The dependence of the reaction on the wavelength of irradiation light was investigated by cutting off a part of the wavelength region of the irradiation light by a series of optical glass lters.Apparently, the activity towards CO production decreased when the irradiation light was ltered on the longer wavelength as shown in Fig. 1.Since the temperature of the reactor was not so different from each other between the case with or without any optical lters, the change in the activity observed here may be due to the change in the wavelength of light rather than in the heat supplied by irradiated light.This result leads us to the conclusion that some photochemical processes are included in this reaction.However, it is not a pure photoreaction because signicant amount of CO was produced even when no irradiation was supplied with the reactor slightly temperature-elevated in the water bath (323 K).The amount of CO production in the dark was larger than that with a glass lter cutting !370 nm or !450 nm.This is not surprising considering that the temperature of the reactor was lower than 323 K under photoirradiation.From these results, we claim that the CO 2 reduction by H 2 on Rh/TiO 2 is a photoenhanced reaction similar to the concept suggested with Ru loaded TiO 2 12,13.Fig. 2 shows the time course of CO production over Rh(1)/TiO 2 under continuous photoirradiation.In the earlier stage of photoreaction, the amount of CO naturally increased with time; however, the increase stopped about 10 h after the photoirradiation started.On the contrary, the decrease in the amount of CO which ought to be once produced was observed.Along with the decrease of CO, the increase of CH 4 production was indeed observed, but the amount of produced CH 4 was far smaller than that of CO decrease.For this reason we cannot assume that CO is converted to CH 4 by hydrogenation during the long irradiation.As a consequence, it must be hypothesized that the Rh/ TiO 2 absorbed the CO.Detailed discussion will be found in the following section. As described in Section 2, the Rh/TiO 2 sample was reduced by H 2 at 523 K after the oxidization by O 2 at 673 K as a pretreatment before photoreactions.We investigated the effect of H 2 reduction of the Rh/TiO 2 sample in the pretreatment by varying the temperature of H 2 treatment on the Rh(1)/TiO 2 .The result is shown in Fig. 3. From this, we can notice that the increase in the reduction temperature above 523 K brings about the drastic decrease in the activity towards CO production.On the other hand, CH 4 production slightly increases when the reduction temperature increases.It suggests that the oxidation state of Rh in Rh(1)/TiO 2 sample controls the selectivity of CO 2 H 2 photoreaction as well as the activity of the reaction.In a word, it seems that when Rh remains oxidized in a proper degree, the activity towards CO production is high.However, when no H 2 treatment was given (i.e., Rh was in a fully oxidized state), the activity was very low either towards CO or CH 4 production: the amount of yielded CO and CH 4 were only 0.2 and 0.1 mmol, respectively.From this, the following ideas are implied: (1) when Rh in Rh/TiO 2 is moderately reduced, the Rh/TiO 2 sample shows the highest activity towards CO production, and (2) as Rh in Rh/TiO 2 is reduced excessively, the product selectivity shifts from CO to CH 4 along with the decrease in the activity. We investigated the effect of the loading amount of Rh on the reaction activity and selectivity with the temperature of H 2 reduction treatment xed to 523 K. Fig. 4 shows the amount of yielded CO and CH 4 over Rh/TiO 2 samples with various amounts of Rh loading after 6 h irradiation.The increase in Rh loading resulted in the decrease in CO evolution.When the amount of Rh increased, thermodynamically preferable CH 4 was yielded rather than CO, although the absolute amount of CH 4 evolution was small.The effect of an increase in the loading amount of Rh seems similar to that of the reductions at higher temperature than 523 K on Rh(1)/TiO 2 .From this, it is assumed that the variation of the loading amount causes the change of the state of Rh on TiO 2 .When the amount of Rh loading is low, Rh may be in a moderately reduced state on the surface of TiO 2 and assist to produce CO. To clarify the assumption mentioned above, we recorded the Rh K-edge X-ray absorption spectra and elucidated the state of Rh on various Rh(X)/TiO 2 (X0.54) samples after pretreatment.Fig. 5(A) shows the Rh K-edge XANES spectra of Rh/ TiO 2 sample with various amounts of Rh loading together with those of Rh foil and Rh 2 O 3 as references.Looking at the series of the spectra, we can see that the shape of the spectrum of Rh(4)/TiO 2 is similar to that of Rh foil, and that the shape of the spectra changes gradually to that of rhodium oxide with the increase of loaded Rh. There have been reports concerning that the XANES spectrum of a sample containing an element in a mixture of different states can be simulated by the linear combination of the spectra of reference compounds corresponding to each oxidation state 21,22.So we also tried to reproduce the XANES spectra of the Rh/TiO 2 samples by the superposition of the spectra of reference compounds with a suitable ratio.Fig. 6 shows the original XANES spectra of the samples with the simulated ones using Rh 2 O 3 and Rh foil as reference compounds.This clearly indicates that the increase in the Rh loading is responsible for the growth of Rh in a metallic state.It is also shown that even the Rh(0.5)/TiO 2 sample contains 35 of metal. On the other hand, Fourier-transforms of k 3 -weighted Rh K-edge EXAFS spectra of the Rh/TiO 2 samples and reference compounds mentioned above are shown in Fig. 5(B).While the peak at around 2.4 A E assigned to metallic RhRh bond is very weak in Rh(0.5)/TiO 2 , it is enhanced together with the increase in the amount of loaded Rh.The peak at around 1.6 A E is assigned to RhO bond, and the intensity of the peak decreases as the amount of Rh increases.The sample richest in Rh, Rh(4)/TiO 2 , shows almost no peak at around 1.6 A E . From the above-mentioned results obtained by the XAS experiments, we concluded that the highly active sample for the CO 2 H 2 photoreaction keeps Rh in a state of the mixture of metal and oxide.The state of Rh involves the selectivity of products also: the more the Rh is reduced, the more is CH 4 produced rather than CO.The former notion is again very similar to that proposed by Thampi et al. 12,13 with Ru/ TiO 2 sample. As described above, the reaction between CO 2 and H 2 over Rh/TiO 2 is enhanced by irradiation.We suppose that the light is absorbed by TiO 2 rather than Rh because no reaction proceeded when Rh/SiO 2 is used instead of Rh/ TiO 2 .Probably the light generates a pair of an excited electron and a positive hole in TiO 2 .The electron moves to Rh to be injected into CO 2 adsorbed on Rh, and the CO 2 is activated to become CO A 2 .This process has been proposed in the literature 15.On the other hand, H 2 is adsorbed on Rh dissociatively, and the dissociated hydrogen may migrate onto TiO 2 surface to react with the positive hole.This process results in the formation of H , which may be bound with an oxygen of TiO 2 to form surface hydroxyl group.In such a way the charge will be separated effectively. As the possibility of the evolution of CO from CO A 2 , the following reaction has been proposed on K-promoted Rh metal surface 23: That is, the disproportionation reaction of two CO A 2 anion radicals into CO and carbonate.As the carbonate species will exist in a stable form on TiO 2 surface, the migration of CO 2A 3 species to TiO 2 surface will further help the above disproportionation reaction. However, it should be kept in mind that there is a possibility of the CO production via any intermediate such as a formate ion.The CO A 2 radical is thought to be more reactive with hydrogen than a neutral CO 2 , and the most plausible product in the rst step of CO 2 hydrogenation is the formate ion.The formation of the formate ion from CO 2 and H 2 in a thermal reaction on supported Rh has already been reported 24.The formate is known to decompose rather easily to yield CO. Since the evolution of CO was practically observed on Rh/TiO 2 under irradiation using formic acid together with H 2 as a reactant, we guess that this mechanism is preferable to that explained from the disproportionation of CO A 2 radical. We have found that when Rh is in a partially reduced state, Rh/TiO 2 shows a high activity in the reaction between CO 2 and H 2 to yield CO. On the contrary, when Rh is reduced to a metallic state, the activity is low and the main product is not CO but CH 4 .This phenomenon can be expressed from the differences in the ability of H 2 dissociation.When Rh is in a partially reduced state, the H 2 dissociation ability of the Rh is suppressed at a suitable degree.When Rh is fully reduced to a metallic state, the H 2 dissociation ability is too strong, and the dissociated hydrogen not only accepts the positive hole but also reacts with negatively charged CO A 2 to hydrogenate it.If the hydrogenation of CO A 2 is completed, the product CH 4 will be released to the gas phase; however, it is suggested that the CO A 2 is not easily hydrogenated to CH 4 but remains on the surface as a form of CH x , because when Rh is fully reduced, the amount of CH 4 is small while the evolution of CO remarkably decreases.This excessive hydrogenation reaction cannot proceed via CO as an intermediate because CO and H 2 did not react on Rh/TiO 2 under irradiation at room temperature. According to the above view, however, the difference of Ru and Rh in the selectivity in CO 2 H 2 reaction cannot be explained.In addition, one cannot illustrate the reason why the highly reduced Ru/TiO 2 does not exhibit higher activity in CH 4 production than partially reduced one.From this, it should be concluded that the oxide state plays an important role as a promoter in some steps of the reaction.Although it is not clear in which step the oxide state works effectively, it may assist the redox reaction between CO 2 and H 2 by changing its oxidation state. Fig. 1 shows the result of CO 2 H 2 reaction under irradiation of several parts of wavelengths, as well as in the dark.It is noteworthy that CO is yielded as a main product of CO 2 reduction even in the dark.CO is an unreasonable product considering the thermodynamic equilibrium of the reverse water-gas shift reaction CO 2 g H 2 g 3 CO g H 2 O gY AG 28X6 kJamol at 298X15 K at room temperature (or at 323 K).This contradiction indicates the removal of one (or two) product(s) which causes the shift of the equilibrium to the right. It is thought that the surface of TiO 2 is highly dehydrated after the evacuation at high temperature in the pretreatment.Hence, signicant amount of surface hydroxyl group can be produced newly on TiO 2 .As H 2 directly forms surface hydroxyl group during the CO 2 H 2 reaction according to the reaction mechanism we proposed in the previous section, it is thought that H 2 O need not be released into the gas phase in the dark reaction for a while. The amount of CO increased from 3.4 to 5.1 mmol when the reaction time was extended from 6 to 24 h in the dark at 323 K.However, the reaction rate is small compared to the case under irradiation.Therefore we have claimed that the reaction is a photo-enhanced reaction'' as Thampi et al. 12,13 previously declared.It should be noted that the dark reactions were performed at 323 K.This temperature is rather higher than the temperature of the reaction system under irradiation.Hence, the amount of CO produced in the dark may be less than 3.4 mmol for 6 h reaction.When the Y-45 optical lter was put to use (i.e., the light with wavelength longer than 450 nm was irradiated), the amount of CO was only 1.4 mmol even under irradiation, although the tempera-ture of the reactor was not very different from each other under irradiation using any optical lter.Thus the value of 1.4 mmol is to be considered as the contribution of the CO evolution by the dark reaction under photoirradiation, since the light with wavelength longer than 450 nm does not contribute to the excitation of TiO 2 .From this, the amount of CO by pure photoreaction should be 7.8 mmol for 6 h reaction, because the total amount of evolved CO is 9.2 mmol and the amount of CO produced by the dark reaction is 1.4 mmol.Therefore, the ratio of the production of CO by the dark reaction to that of the photoreaction under irradiation without any lter is calculated to be only 18. As depicted in Fig. 2, we can understand that CO is once yielded at the earlier stage of the reaction, but removed from the gas phase afterwards.It suggests that CO is adsorbed to Rh/TiO 2 or converted to other compounds.Between these two possibilities, the former one (i.e., simple adsorption process) should be excluded.If the adsorption was the main reason, a part of produced CO might have immediately been adsorbed on Rh/TiO 2 after its production, and the other part might have been released to the gas phase since the rate of CO adsorption was thought to be enough fast.Therefore the amount of CO might increase monotonously.In practice, however, the amount of CO in the gas phase decreased after reaching the maximum amount.Hence the simple adsorption should not be the reason of this peculiar behavior.This leads us to the conclusion that CO is converted to other compounds during the long period of reaction. Many investigators have reported that Rh forms rhodium carbonyl clusters under CO atmosphere 25.Considering that, we prospected the formation of Rh m (CO) n species during the photoreaction because in later part of the photoreaction the Rh/TiO 2 sample is surrounded with gaseous CO produced in the reaction.The conversion of Rh into Rh m (CO) n species can also be the reason of the decrease in the activity towards CO production.Accordingly, the rapid decrease of gaseous CO after long time irradiation can be successfully explained: the rapid decrease of CO is brought about both by the reaction between Rh and CO, and by the decline of the production of CO. The formation of Rh m (CO) n is supported by the desorbed gases by heat treatment at 573 K after photoreaction.The main component of the desorbed gases by heat treatment was CO.This indicates that more amount of CO exists on the surface of Rh/TiO 2 , although it is not clear in which form they exist on the surface.However, taking it into consideration that the Rh m (CO) n species was decomposed at temperature up to ca. 573 K 26, the carbonyl cluster is one of the candidates of the compounds formed during photoreaction on the surface.Furthermore, the XANES spectrum of Rh/TiO 2 also suggests the change of the state of Rh before and after photoreaction.The XANES spectra of Rh(1)/TiO 2 and Rh(4)/TiO 2 after photoreaction and their simulation spectra using those of reference compounds are shown in Fig. 7.A good tting result was achieved in the case of Rh(4)/TiO 2 (Fig. 7(a)), while in Rh(1)/TiO 2 the tting with the spectra of Rh foil and Rh 2 O 3 as the reference compounds did not get along well.Taking into account that the spectrum of Rh(1)/ TiO 2 before photoreaction could be t with those of the reference compounds, we concluded that another chemical species than a metal or an oxide formed on Rh(1)/TiO 2 during the photoreaction.It is supposed that the other species is the compound made of Rh and CO.Therefore, we tried to simulate the XANES of Rh(1)/TiO 2 after photoreaction using the spectrum of Rh(CO) 2 Cl 2 along with Rh foil and Rh 2 O 3 .The result was a little better than that without Rh(CO) 2 Cl 2 as shown in Fig. 7(b).This suggests the formation of rhodium carbonyl compounds in a sense.However, we should not establish the existence of the compounds simply because of the success in the simulation of XANES spectrum by Rh(CO) 2 Cl 2 .It is only a reinforcement of the hypothesis and the speculation. The above results are, of course, not enough for the evidences pointing out that rhodium carbonyl compounds form on Rh/TiO 2 .However, it is certain that the compound to which CO is converted does not relate to the reaction path of CO 2 photoreduction by H 2 : the compound is yielded after the production of CO from CO 2 and H 2 .Therefore, if we can remove CO from the reactor by some chemical engineering methods, the photoreaction possibly proceeds continuously because the change in the state of Rh can be avoided. Rh-loading TiO 2 is found to show high activity towards photoreduction of CO 2 by H 2 under mild condition of low pressure and room temperature.When Rh on TiO 2 is in a mixture of metal and oxide, the high activity towards CO 2 photoreduction by H 2 to CO is observed.When Rh is fully reduced, the activity is drastically lowered in addition to the change of the main product from CO to CH 4 .This change can be explained by the suppression in the H 2 dissociation ability by Rh in an oxide state as well as the effect of the oxide state as a promoter.The deactivation of the sample and the decrease of once produced CO during a long period of reaction are both illustrated from the formation of rhodium carbonyl compounds from Rh and CO.

We tried to reduce CO 2 by H 2 on Rh(1)/TiO 2 under photoirradiation.After 6 h irradiation, 9.2 mmol of CO and a small amount (0.1 mmol) of CH 4 were produced.Any other products such as hydrocarbons or oxygenates were not detected.The activity was very high compared to those reported by us previously using the same reaction system with ZrO 2 samples 19,20.When only CO 2 was introduced and no H 2 was admitted to the reactor, no product was detected even after photoirradiation.On the contrary, when only H 2 (i.e., no CO 2 ) was introduced, the evolution of CH 4 was observed.This indicates that there are some carbon residues on the Rh/TiO 2 sample.However, the amount of CH 4 was too small (0.05 mmol).From these results, we concluded that the CO obtained here comes from CO 2 , and that this reaction is a reduction of CO 2 by H 2 . The dependence of the reaction on the wavelength of irradiation light was investigated by cutting off a part of the wavelength region of the irradiation light by a series of optical glass lters.Apparently, the activity towards CO production decreased when the irradiation light was ltered on the longer wavelength as shown in Fig. 1.Since the temperature of the reactor was not so different from each other between the case with or without any optical lters, the change in the activity observed here may be due to the change in the wavelength of light rather than in the heat supplied by irradiated light.This result leads us to the conclusion that some photochemical processes are included in this reaction.However, it is not a pure photoreaction because signicant amount of CO was produced even when no irradiation was supplied with the reactor slightly temperature-elevated in the water bath (323 K).The amount of CO production in the dark was larger than that with a glass lter cutting !370 nm or !450 nm.This is not surprising considering that the temperature of the reactor was lower than 323 K under photoirradiation.From these results, we claim that the CO 2 reduction by H 2 on Rh/TiO 2 is a photoenhanced reaction similar to the concept suggested with Ru loaded TiO 2 12,13.Fig. 2 shows the time course of CO production over Rh(1)/TiO 2 under continuous photoirradiation.In the earlier stage of photoreaction, the amount of CO naturally increased with time; however, the increase stopped about 10 h after the photoirradiation started.On the contrary, the decrease in the amount of CO which ought to be once produced was observed.Along with the decrease of CO, the increase of CH 4 production was indeed observed, but the amount of produced CH 4 was far smaller than that of CO decrease.For this reason we cannot assume that CO is converted to CH 4 by hydrogenation during the long irradiation.As a consequence, it must be hypothesized that the Rh/ TiO 2 absorbed the CO.Detailed discussion will be found in the following section. As described in Section 2, the Rh/TiO 2 sample was reduced by H 2 at 523 K after the oxidization by O 2 at 673 K as a pretreatment before photoreactions.We investigated the effect of H 2 reduction of the Rh/TiO 2 sample in the pretreatment by varying the temperature of H 2 treatment on the Rh(1)/TiO 2 .The result is shown in Fig. 3. From this, we can notice that the increase in the reduction temperature above 523 K brings about the drastic decrease in the activity towards CO production.On the other hand, CH 4 production slightly increases when the reduction temperature increases.It suggests that the oxidation state of Rh in Rh(1)/TiO 2 sample controls the selectivity of CO 2 H 2 photoreaction as well as the activity of the reaction.In a word, it seems that when Rh remains oxidized in a proper degree, the activity towards CO production is high.However, when no H 2 treatment was given (i.e., Rh was in a fully oxidized state), the activity was very low either towards CO or CH 4 production: the amount of yielded CO and CH 4 were only 0.2 and 0.1 mmol, respectively.From this, the following ideas are implied: (1) when Rh in Rh/TiO 2 is moderately reduced, the Rh/TiO 2 sample shows the highest activity towards CO production, and (2) as Rh in Rh/TiO 2 is reduced excessively, the product selectivity shifts from CO to CH 4 along with the decrease in the activity. We investigated the effect of the loading amount of Rh on the reaction activity and selectivity with the temperature of H 2 reduction treatment xed to 523 K. Fig. 4 shows the amount of yielded CO and CH 4 over Rh/TiO 2 samples with various amounts of Rh loading after 6 h irradiation.The increase in Rh loading resulted in the decrease in CO evolution.When the amount of Rh increased, thermodynamically preferable CH 4 was yielded rather than CO, although the absolute amount of CH 4 evolution was small.The effect of an increase in the loading amount of Rh seems similar to that of the reductions at higher temperature than 523 K on Rh(1)/TiO 2 .From this, it is assumed that the variation of the loading amount causes the change of the state of Rh on TiO 2 .When the amount of Rh loading is low, Rh may be in a moderately reduced state on the surface of TiO 2 and assist to produce CO. To clarify the assumption mentioned above, we recorded the Rh K-edge X-ray absorption spectra and elucidated the state of Rh on various Rh(X)/TiO 2 (X0.54) samples after pretreatment.Fig. 5(A) shows the Rh K-edge XANES spectra of Rh/ TiO 2 sample with various amounts of Rh loading together with those of Rh foil and Rh 2 O 3 as references.Looking at the series of the spectra, we can see that the shape of the spectrum of Rh(4)/TiO 2 is similar to that of Rh foil, and that the shape of the spectra changes gradually to that of rhodium oxide with the increase of loaded Rh. There have been reports concerning that the XANES spectrum of a sample containing an element in a mixture of different states can be simulated by the linear combination of the spectra of reference compounds corresponding to each oxidation state 21,22.So we also tried to reproduce the XANES spectra of the Rh/TiO 2 samples by the superposition of the spectra of reference compounds with a suitable ratio.Fig. 6 shows the original XANES spectra of the samples with the simulated ones using Rh 2 O 3 and Rh foil as reference compounds.This clearly indicates that the increase in the Rh loading is responsible for the growth of Rh in a metallic state.It is also shown that even the Rh(0.5)/TiO 2 sample contains 35 of metal. On the other hand, Fourier-transforms of k 3 -weighted Rh K-edge EXAFS spectra of the Rh/TiO 2 samples and reference compounds mentioned above are shown in Fig. 5(B).While the peak at around 2.4 A E assigned to metallic RhRh bond is very weak in Rh(0.5)/TiO 2 , it is enhanced together with the increase in the amount of loaded Rh.The peak at around 1.6 A E is assigned to RhO bond, and the intensity of the peak decreases as the amount of Rh increases.The sample richest in Rh, Rh(4)/TiO 2 , shows almost no peak at around 1.6 A E . From the above-mentioned results obtained by the XAS experiments, we concluded that the highly active sample for the CO 2 H 2 photoreaction keeps Rh in a state of the mixture of metal and oxide.The state of Rh involves the selectivity of products also: the more the Rh is reduced, the more is CH 4 produced rather than CO.The former notion is again very similar to that proposed by Thampi et al. 12,13 with Ru/ TiO 2 sample. As described above, the reaction between CO 2 and H 2 over Rh/TiO 2 is enhanced by irradiation.We suppose that the light is absorbed by TiO 2 rather than Rh because no reaction proceeded when Rh/SiO 2 is used instead of Rh/ TiO 2 .Probably the light generates a pair of an excited electron and a positive hole in TiO 2 .The electron moves to Rh to be injected into CO 2 adsorbed on Rh, and the CO 2 is activated to become CO A 2 .This process has been proposed in the literature 15.On the other hand, H 2 is adsorbed on Rh dissociatively, and the dissociated hydrogen may migrate onto TiO 2 surface to react with the positive hole.This process results in the formation of H , which may be bound with an oxygen of TiO 2 to form surface hydroxyl group.In such a way the charge will be separated effectively. As the possibility of the evolution of CO from CO A 2 , the following reaction has been proposed on K-promoted Rh metal surface 23: That is, the disproportionation reaction of two CO A 2 anion radicals into CO and carbonate.As the carbonate species will exist in a stable form on TiO 2 surface, the migration of CO 2A 3 species to TiO 2 surface will further help the above disproportionation reaction. However, it should be kept in mind that there is a possibility of the CO production via any intermediate such as a formate ion.The CO A 2 radical is thought to be more reactive with hydrogen than a neutral CO 2 , and the most plausible product in the rst step of CO 2 hydrogenation is the formate ion.The formation of the formate ion from CO 2 and H 2 in a thermal reaction on supported Rh has already been reported 24.The formate is known to decompose rather easily to yield CO. Since the evolution of CO was practically observed on Rh/TiO 2 under irradiation using formic acid together with H 2 as a reactant, we guess that this mechanism is preferable to that explained from the disproportionation of CO A 2 radical. We have found that when Rh is in a partially reduced state, Rh/TiO 2 shows a high activity in the reaction between CO 2 and H 2 to yield CO. On the contrary, when Rh is reduced to a metallic state, the activity is low and the main product is not CO but CH 4 .This phenomenon can be expressed from the differences in the ability of H 2 dissociation.When Rh is in a partially reduced state, the H 2 dissociation ability of the Rh is suppressed at a suitable degree.When Rh is fully reduced to a metallic state, the H 2 dissociation ability is too strong, and the dissociated hydrogen not only accepts the positive hole but also reacts with negatively charged CO A 2 to hydrogenate it.If the hydrogenation of CO A 2 is completed, the product CH 4 will be released to the gas phase; however, it is suggested that the CO A 2 is not easily hydrogenated to CH 4 but remains on the surface as a form of CH x , because when Rh is fully reduced, the amount of CH 4 is small while the evolution of CO remarkably decreases.This excessive hydrogenation reaction cannot proceed via CO as an intermediate because CO and H 2 did not react on Rh/TiO 2 under irradiation at room temperature. According to the above view, however, the difference of Ru and Rh in the selectivity in CO 2 H 2 reaction cannot be explained.In addition, one cannot illustrate the reason why the highly reduced Ru/TiO 2 does not exhibit higher activity in CH 4 production than partially reduced one.From this, it should be concluded that the oxide state plays an important role as a promoter in some steps of the reaction.Although it is not clear in which step the oxide state works effectively, it may assist the redox reaction between CO 2 and H 2 by changing its oxidation state. Fig. 1 shows the result of CO 2 H 2 reaction under irradiation of several parts of wavelengths, as well as in the dark.It is noteworthy that CO is yielded as a main product of CO 2 reduction even in the dark.CO is an unreasonable product considering the thermodynamic equilibrium of the reverse water-gas shift reaction CO 2 g H 2 g 3 CO g H 2 O gY AG 28X6 kJamol at 298X15 K at room temperature (or at 323 K).This contradiction indicates the removal of one (or two) product(s) which causes the shift of the equilibrium to the right. It is thought that the surface of TiO 2 is highly dehydrated after the evacuation at high temperature in the pretreatment.Hence, signicant amount of surface hydroxyl group can be produced newly on TiO 2 .As H 2 directly forms surface hydroxyl group during the CO 2 H 2 reaction according to the reaction mechanism we proposed in the previous section, it is thought that H 2 O need not be released into the gas phase in the dark reaction for a while. The amount of CO increased from 3.4 to 5.1 mmol when the reaction time was extended from 6 to 24 h in the dark at 323 K.However, the reaction rate is small compared to the case under irradiation.Therefore we have claimed that the reaction is a photo-enhanced reaction'' as Thampi et al. 12,13 previously declared.It should be noted that the dark reactions were performed at 323 K.This temperature is rather higher than the temperature of the reaction system under irradiation.Hence, the amount of CO produced in the dark may be less than 3.4 mmol for 6 h reaction.When the Y-45 optical lter was put to use (i.e., the light with wavelength longer than 450 nm was irradiated), the amount of CO was only 1.4 mmol even under irradiation, although the tempera-ture of the reactor was not very different from each other under irradiation using any optical lter.Thus the value of 1.4 mmol is to be considered as the contribution of the CO evolution by the dark reaction under photoirradiation, since the light with wavelength longer than 450 nm does not contribute to the excitation of TiO 2 .From this, the amount of CO by pure photoreaction should be 7.8 mmol for 6 h reaction, because the total amount of evolved CO is 9.2 mmol and the amount of CO produced by the dark reaction is 1.4 mmol.Therefore, the ratio of the production of CO by the dark reaction to that of the photoreaction under irradiation without any lter is calculated to be only 18. As depicted in Fig. 2, we can understand that CO is once yielded at the earlier stage of the reaction, but removed from the gas phase afterwards.It suggests that CO is adsorbed to Rh/TiO 2 or converted to other compounds.Between these two possibilities, the former one (i.e., simple adsorption process) should be excluded.If the adsorption was the main reason, a part of produced CO might have immediately been adsorbed on Rh/TiO 2 after its production, and the other part might have been released to the gas phase since the rate of CO adsorption was thought to be enough fast.Therefore the amount of CO might increase monotonously.In practice, however, the amount of CO in the gas phase decreased after reaching the maximum amount.Hence the simple adsorption should not be the reason of this peculiar behavior.This leads us to the conclusion that CO is converted to other compounds during the long period of reaction. Many investigators have reported that Rh forms rhodium carbonyl clusters under CO atmosphere 25.Considering that, we prospected the formation of Rh m (CO) n species during the photoreaction because in later part of the photoreaction the Rh/TiO 2 sample is surrounded with gaseous CO produced in the reaction.The conversion of Rh into Rh m (CO) n species can also be the reason of the decrease in the activity towards CO production.Accordingly, the rapid decrease of gaseous CO after long time irradiation can be successfully explained: the rapid decrease of CO is brought about both by the reaction between Rh and CO, and by the decline of the production of CO. The formation of Rh m (CO) n is supported by the desorbed gases by heat treatment at 573 K after photoreaction.The main component of the desorbed gases by heat treatment was CO.This indicates that more amount of CO exists on the surface of Rh/TiO 2 , although it is not clear in which form they exist on the surface.However, taking it into consideration that the Rh m (CO) n species was decomposed at temperature up to ca. 573 K 26, the carbonyl cluster is one of the candidates of the compounds formed during photoreaction on the surface.Furthermore, the XANES spectrum of Rh/TiO 2 also suggests the change of the state of Rh before and after photoreaction.The XANES spectra of Rh(1)/TiO 2 and Rh(4)/TiO 2 after photoreaction and their simulation spectra using those of reference compounds are shown in Fig. 7.A good tting result was achieved in the case of Rh(4)/TiO 2 (Fig. 7(a)), while in Rh(1)/TiO 2 the tting with the spectra of Rh foil and Rh 2 O 3 as the reference compounds did not get along well.Taking into account that the spectrum of Rh(1)/ TiO 2 before photoreaction could be t with those of the reference compounds, we concluded that another chemical species than a metal or an oxide formed on Rh(1)/TiO 2 during the photoreaction.It is supposed that the other species is the compound made of Rh and CO.Therefore, we tried to simulate the XANES of Rh(1)/TiO 2 after photoreaction using the spectrum of Rh(CO) 2 Cl 2 along with Rh foil and Rh 2 O 3 .The result was a little better than that without Rh(CO) 2 Cl 2 as shown in Fig. 7(b).This suggests the formation of rhodium carbonyl compounds in a sense.However, we should not establish the existence of the compounds simply because of the success in the simulation of XANES spectrum by Rh(CO) 2 Cl 2 .It is only a reinforcement of the hypothesis and the speculation. The above results are, of course, not enough for the evidences pointing out that rhodium carbonyl compounds form on Rh/TiO 2 .However, it is certain that the compound to which CO is converted does not relate to the reaction path of CO 2 photoreduction by H 2 : the compound is yielded after the production of CO from CO 2 and H 2 .Therefore, if we can remove CO from the reactor by some chemical engineering methods, the photoreaction possibly proceeds continuously because the change in the state of Rh can be avoided. Rh-loading TiO 2 is found to show high activity towards photoreduction of CO 2 by H 2 under mild condition of low pressure and room temperature.When Rh on TiO 2 is in a mixture of metal and oxide, the high activity towards CO 2 photoreduction by H 2 to CO is observed.When Rh is fully reduced, the activity is drastically lowered in addition to the change of the main product from CO to CH 4 .This change can be explained by the suppression in the H 2 dissociation ability by Rh in an oxide state as well as the effect of the oxide state as a promoter.The deactivation of the sample and the decrease of once produced CO during a long period of reaction are both illustrated from the formation of rhodium carbonyl compounds from Rh and CO.
