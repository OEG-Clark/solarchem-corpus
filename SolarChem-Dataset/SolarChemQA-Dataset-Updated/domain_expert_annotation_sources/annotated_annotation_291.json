activity of the optimized photocatalyst was found to be due to the lower number of Ti-O-Ti or TiO 2 agglomerates and to the more isolated Ti species, which were uniformly dispersed on the 3-D KIT-6 mesoporous silica support without damage to mesopore structure.", "context": "New nanoporous silica (KIT-6 dried or calcined) incorporated with isolated Ti materials with different Si/Ti ratios (Si/Ti 200, 100, and 50) synthesized has shown that Ti-KIT-6 (calcined, Si/Ti 200, 100, and 50) were better in activity than the Ti-KIT-6 (dried, Si/Ti 200, 100, and 50) materials, due to the presence of more accessible surface reaction Ti species.The main fuel products obtained after the reaction are CH 4 , CO, H 2 , and CH 3 OH (vapors).Moreover, it has been found that Ti-KIT-6 (Si/Ti 100) shows a better product formation than Ti-KIT-6 (Si/Ti 200 and 50).The high activity of the optimized photocatalyst was found to be due to the lower number of Ti-O-Ti or TiO 2 agglomerates and to the more isolated Ti species, which were uniformly dispersed on the 3-D KIT-6 mesoporous silica support without damage to mesopore structure.The increased surface concentrations of OH groups found in Ti-KIT-6 also boosted the higher activity.It has been concluded that the activity of the optimized Ti-KIT-6(Si/Ti 100) is also much higher than that of the commercial Degussa P25 TiO 2 , due to the longer life and the more energetic active sites in the optimized Ti-KIT-6(Si/Ti 100) photocatalyst than in the bulk commercial TiO 2 one.These findings indicate that the highly dispersed isolated Ti, within the new KIT-6 mesoporous silica 3-D framework, can be considered a promising and effective photocatalyst for CO 2 conversion to fuels and as a suitable candidate for other research activities.
