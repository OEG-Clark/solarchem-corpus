Therefore, free energy changes relative to an initial state of gaseous CO 2 free above an empty surface can be displayed by: Photocurrent measurements were performed on a CHI 730E electrochemical work station (Chenhua Instrument, Shanghai, China) in a standard three-electrode system with photocatalystcoated ITO as working electrode, Pt plate as counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl as reference electrode.CH 3 CN solution of 0.1 M (n-Bu) 4 N(PF 6 ) was used as electrolyte.The as-synthesized sample (5 mg) was added into 20 L Nafion and 2.0 mL ethanol solution, and the working electrode was prepared by dropping the suspension (200 L) onto the surface of an ITO plate.The working electrode was dried at room temperature, and the photo-responsive signals of the samples were measured under chopped light at 0.5 V.

The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 experiments were carried out in a batch-type reaction system (CEL-SPH2N-D9, CeAulight, China) equipped with a homemade gas-solid reactor (Fig. S1 ).The photocatalyst (2 mg) was uniformly dispersed into a circular glass-fibre membrane (0.22 m pore diameter) with an illuminated area of about 2.8 cm 2 .The membrane activated in vacuum at 150 C for 12

MIL-100(Fe) and MIL-101(Fe) were synthesized and characterized in a conventional way (Fig. 1).The morphologies of the as-prepared samples display monodispersed nanocrystals and present typical octahedral-shaped morphology (Fig. S2 ).The as-obtained samples reveal welldistinguished diffraction peaks that matched well with the simulated ones, demonstrating the framework structures were achieved successfully (Fig. 2a and2b).The results imply that MIL-100(Fe) has kinetically advantage for CO 2 transformation. 58V-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-DRS) was employed to evaluate the optical-response and the results display that both samples have optical absorption covering the UV-visible region owing to the presence of -O-Fe clusters (Fig. 3a).59 The bandgap of MIL-100(Fe) and MIL-101(Fe) are identified to be about 2.65 and 2.08 eV, respectively (Fig. S7 ).This journal is The Royal Society of Chemistry 20xx Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins Mott-Schottky (MS) measurements were performed to determine the conduct band (LUMO) of MIL-100(Fe) and MIL-101(Fe).The positive slopes imply typical n-type semiconductor-like character.The flat-band potentials of MIL-100(Fe) and MIL-101(Fe) are determined to be -0.98 and -1.04 V vs. normalized hydrogen electrode (NHE), respectively (Fig. S8 ).The potentials of these samples are more negative than the redox potential of CO 2 to CO (-0.53 V vs. NHE) as well as to CH 4 (-0.24V vs. NHE), accordingly, these materials have capability for CO 2 photoreduction.Besides, to assess the separation efficiency of photo-excited charge carriers, photocurrent response was measured with the illumination of visible-light.As illustrated in Fig. 3b, MIL-100(Fe) possesses higher photocurrent than MIL-101(Fe), reflecting that MIL-100(Fe) has more efficient interface charge separation.Additionally, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) for MIL-100(Fe) implies low resistance in the Nyquist plots (Fig. 3c), also indicating the fast interface charge transfer.Furthermore, the time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) decay spectra suggest that the average PL lifetimes of MIL-100(Fe) and MIL-101(Fe) are calculated to be 0.46 and 0.25 ns, respectively (Fig. 3d).The prolonged lifetime further proves that the free charges in MIL-100(Fe) may transfer for more extended until recombination.On account of the efficient charge separation and prolonged charge lifetime, MIL-100(Fe) can be considered as a desired photocatalyst for CO 2 reduction.Visible-light driven photoreduction of CO 2 was conducted via a solvent-free reaction route by utilizing triethanolamine (TEOA) as sacrificial agent.As displayed in Fig. 4, two samples exhibit distinct yields of transformation CO 2 to CO and CH 4 in five hours under the visible-light irradiation (Fig. S9 with calibration curves and Fig. S10 ).In order to monitor the liquid products, 1 H NMR spectral measurements were conducted, and no liquid product was detected in the catalytic process (Fig. S11 ), which may be due to the employment of solvent-free reaction system. 26,29,31Additionally, no H 2 -production was detected by gas chromatography (GC) during the whole catalytic process (Fig. S12 ).Clearly, MIL-100(Fe) exhibits superior catalytic activity with CO and CH 4 generation.Importantly, the MIL-100(Fe) achieves high selectivity of about 98 for CH 4 formation (relative to the total number of reacted electrons) (Fig. S13 ).Meanwhile, MIL-101(Fe) displays limited catalytic activity with CO and CH 4 production.Thus, MIL-100(Fe) possesses superior selectivity and activity for CO 2 conversion into CH 4 .In addition, solar-to-methane (CH 4 ) conversion efficiency () and apparent quantum efficiency (AQY) over MIL-100(Fe) are 0.023 and 0.943, respectively.It is noticeable that MIL-100(Fe) gives high AQY compared with the MIL-101(Fe) and reported heterogeneous photocatalysts (Table S1 ).To further illustrate the photocatalytic activity, the turnover frequencies (TOF) of these catalysts were determined by the amount of metal active sites, and corresponding TOF values of these photocatalysts are displayed in Fig 4a.In order to verify the carbon origins of the target products of CO and CH 4 , 13 C-labeled 13 CO 2 was applied for the photocatalytic test.The reaction products 13 CO and 13 CH 4 were confirmed by mass spectrometry (Fig. S14 ), ensuring that both goal products resulted from CO 2 reduction.To further explore the photocatalytic activity of MIL-100(Fe), we compared the photocatalytic activity of MIL-100(Fe) with additional catalysts (Fig. 4a) such as MIL-100(Cr, Al), MIL-88B(Fe) and MIL-53(Fe).All samples exhibit weak photocatalytic activity.Additionally, the constituents of MIL-100(Fe), including iron net and BTC, give an insignificant photocatalytic effect (Fig. 4), thus indicating the importance of the MIL-100(Fe) skeleton for the photocatalytic Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins reaction.According to the previous work, 29 NH 2 -MIL-101(Fe) possesses a superior selectivity for conversion of CO 2 to CO.More importantly, the order of CH 4 -yield is MIL-100(Fe) MIL-101(Fe) MIL-88B(Fe) NH 2 -MIL-101(Fe).Meanwhile, the order of CO-yield is NH 2 -MIL-101(Fe) MIL-101(Fe) MIL-88B(Fe) MIL-100(Fe) (Table S2 ).These results demonstrate that the photocatalytic performance of Fe-based MOFs was improved by changing organic ligand with identical Fe-oxo clusters.In addition, the different performance of these photocatalysts may also be attributed to their unique framework structures.MIL-100(Fe) and MIL-101(Fe)/NH 2 -MIL-101(Fe) possess uniform Fe-oxo clusters and four 3 -O-bridged Fe 3 O clusters together constitute a tetrahedron as structural unit (Fig. S15 ).For MIL-101(Fe) or NH 2 -MIL-101(Fe), terephthalate (BDC) or aminosubstituted terephthalate (NH 2 -BDC) ligands as the edge of tetrahedron connect with Fe 3 O clusters, while MIL-100(Fe) with tricarboxylate (BTC) one as the facet of tetrahedron coordinates with the Fe 3 O clusters.Comparatively speaking, the structural unit of MIL-100(Fe) is more closely arranged than the one of MIL-101(Fe) or NH 2 -MIL-101(Fe) (Fig. S16 ), in which closely packed tetrahedron structure is conducive to the migration of electrons.Furthermore, MIL-100(Fe) has greater Fe 3 O cluster density than MIL-101(Fe) within the same photocatalytic area (Fig. S17 ), in which the CO 2 photoreduction occurs.As for MIL-88B(Fe), with the triangular bipyramidal arrangement of five Fe 3 O clusters (Fig. S18 ), the structure unit is loosely arranged than the tetrahedron as the structural unit, and further results poor photocatalytic activity than MIL-100(Fe) and MIL-101(Fe).More significantly, the electrophilicity of coordinated organic ligands follows the order: NH 2 -BDC BDC BTC, and MIL-100(Fe) displays a more efficient inter-cluster delocalization. 45,60Hence, the excellent photocatalytic activity of MIL-100(Fe) can be attributed to the closely arranged structural units, BTC with high electrophilicity and further reduced electron-density of the Fe 3 O clusters.Furthermore, a series of control tests were conducted in the vacuum or dark or without photocatalyst or TEOA.The target products were undetectable in these catalytic systems (Table S3 ).Importantly, the photostability of MIL-100(Fe) was evaluated using recycling experiments.As shown in Fig. S19 , MIL-100(Fe) exhibits the long-term photocatalytic stability after multiple uninterrupted cycles.Corresponding SEM image, PXRD pattern and XPS spectra after the photocatalysis were shown in Figs.S20-S22 .The post-catalyst retained the octahedral morphology after multiple photocatalytic test, except that its surface became rough.These results demonstrate that the morphology, crystalline-structure and oxidation state of MIL-100(Fe) have no noticeable alteration, confirming the structural robustness.

"MOFs MIL-100(Fe) and MIL-101(Fe) were synthesized and characterized in a conventional way (Fig. 1).The morphologies of the as-prepared samples display monodispersed nanocrystals and present typical octahedral-shaped morphology (Fig. S2 ).The as-obtained samples reveal welldistinguished diffraction peaks that matched well with the simulated ones, demonstrating the framework structures were achieved successfully (Fig. 2a and2b).The results imply that MIL-100(Fe) has kinetically advantage for CO 2 transformation. 58V-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-DRS) was employed to evaluate the optical-response and the results display that both samples have optical absorption covering the UV-visible region owing to the presence of -O-Fe clusters (Fig. 3a).59 The bandgap of MIL-100(Fe) and MIL-101(Fe) are identified to be about 2.65 and 2.08 eV, respectively (Fig. S7 ).This journal is The Royal Society of Chemistry 20xx Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins Mott-Schottky (MS) measurements were performed to determine the conduct band (LUMO) of MIL-100(Fe) and MIL-101(Fe).The positive slopes imply typical n-type semiconductor-like character.The flat-band potentials of MIL-100(Fe) and MIL-101(Fe) are determined to be -0.98 and -1.04 V vs. normalized hydrogen electrode (NHE), respectively (Fig. S8 ).The potentials of these samples are more negative than the redox potential of CO 2 to CO (-0.53 V vs. NHE) as well as to CH 4 (-0.24V vs. NHE), accordingly, these materials have capability for CO 2 photoreduction.Besides, to assess the separation efficiency of photo-excited charge carriers, photocurrent response was measured with the illumination of visible-light.As illustrated in Fig. 3b, MIL-100(Fe) possesses higher photocurrent than MIL-101(Fe), reflecting that MIL-100(Fe) has more efficient interface charge separation.Additionally, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) for MIL-100(Fe) implies low resistance in the Nyquist plots (Fig. 3c), also indicating the fast interface charge transfer.Furthermore, the time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) decay spectra suggest that the average PL lifetimes of MIL-100(Fe) and MIL-101(Fe) are calculated to be 0.46 and 0.25 ns, respectively (Fig. 3d).The prolonged lifetime further proves that the free charges in MIL-100(Fe) may transfer for more extended until recombination.On account of the efficient charge separation and prolonged charge lifetime, MIL-100(Fe) can be considered as a desired photocatalyst for CO 2 reduction.Visible-light driven photoreduction of CO 2 was conducted via a solvent-free reaction route by utilizing triethanolamine (TEOA) as sacrificial agent.As displayed in Fig. 4, two samples exhibit distinct yields of transformation CO 2 to CO and CH 4 in five hours under the visible-light irradiation (Fig. S9 with calibration curves and Fig. S10 ).In order to monitor the liquid products, 1 H NMR spectral measurements were conducted, and no liquid product was detected in the catalytic process (Fig. S11 ), which may be due to the employment of solvent-free reaction system. 26,29,31Additionally, no H 2 -production was detected by gas chromatography (GC) during the whole catalytic process (Fig. S12 ).Clearly, MIL-100(Fe) exhibits superior catalytic activity with CO and CH 4 generation.Importantly, the MIL-100(Fe) achieves high selectivity of about 98 for CH 4 formation (relative to the total number of reacted electrons) (Fig. S13 ).Meanwhile, MIL-101(Fe) displays limited catalytic activity with CO and CH 4 production.Thus, MIL-100(Fe) possesses superior selectivity and activity for CO 2 conversion into CH 4 .In addition, solar-to-methane (CH 4 ) conversion efficiency () and apparent quantum efficiency (AQY) over MIL-100(Fe) are 0.023 and 0.943, respectively.It is noticeable that MIL-100(Fe) gives high AQY compared with the MIL-101(Fe) and reported heterogeneous photocatalysts (Table S1 ).To further illustrate the photocatalytic activity, the turnover frequencies (TOF) of these catalysts were determined by the amount of metal active sites, and corresponding TOF values of these photocatalysts are displayed in Fig 4a.In order to verify the carbon origins of the target products of CO and CH 4 , 13 C-labeled 13 CO 2 was applied for the photocatalytic test.The reaction products 13 CO and 13 CH 4 were confirmed by mass spectrometry (Fig. S14 ), ensuring that both goal products resulted from CO 2 reduction.To further explore the photocatalytic activity of MIL-100(Fe), we compared the photocatalytic activity of MIL-100(Fe) with additional catalysts (Fig. 4a) such as MIL-100(Cr, Al), MIL-88B(Fe) and MIL-53(Fe).All samples exhibit weak photocatalytic activity.Additionally, the constituents of MIL-100(Fe), including iron net and BTC, give an insignificant photocatalytic effect (Fig. 4), thus indicating the importance of the MIL-100(Fe) skeleton for the photocatalytic Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins reaction.According to the previous work, 29 NH 2 -MIL-101(Fe) possesses a superior selectivity for conversion of CO 2 to CO.More importantly, the order of CH 4 -yield is MIL-100(Fe) MIL-101(Fe) MIL-88B(Fe) NH 2 -MIL-101(Fe).Meanwhile, the order of CO-yield is NH 2 -MIL-101(Fe) MIL-101(Fe) MIL-88B(Fe) MIL-100(Fe) (Table S2 ).These results demonstrate that the photocatalytic performance of Fe-based MOFs was improved by changing organic ligand with identical Fe-oxo clusters.In addition, the different performance of these photocatalysts may also be attributed to their unique framework structures.MIL-100(Fe) and MIL-101(Fe)/NH 2 -MIL-101(Fe) possess uniform Fe-oxo clusters and four 3 -O-bridged Fe 3 O clusters together constitute a tetrahedron as structural unit (Fig. S15 ).For MIL-101(Fe) or NH 2 -MIL-101(Fe), terephthalate (BDC) or aminosubstituted terephthalate (NH 2 -BDC) ligands as the edge of tetrahedron connect with Fe 3 O clusters, while MIL-100(Fe) with tricarboxylate (BTC) one as the facet of tetrahedron coordinates with the Fe 3 O clusters.Comparatively speaking, the structural unit of MIL-100(Fe) is more closely arranged than the one of MIL-101(Fe) or NH 2 -MIL-101(Fe) (Fig. S16 ), in which closely packed tetrahedron structure is conducive to the migration of electrons.Furthermore, MIL-100(Fe) has greater Fe 3 O cluster density than MIL-101(Fe) within the same photocatalytic area (Fig. S17 ), in which the CO 2 photoreduction occurs.As for MIL-88B(Fe), with the triangular bipyramidal arrangement of five Fe 3 O clusters (Fig. S18 ), the structure unit is loosely arranged than the tetrahedron as the structural unit, and further results poor photocatalytic activity than MIL-100(Fe) and MIL-101(Fe).More significantly, the electrophilicity of coordinated organic ligands follows the order: NH 2 -BDC BDC BTC, and MIL-100(Fe) displays a more efficient inter-cluster delocalization. 45,60Hence, the excellent photocatalytic activity of MIL-100(Fe) can be attributed to the closely arranged structural units, BTC with high electrophilicity and further reduced electron-density of the Fe 3 O clusters.Furthermore, a series of control tests were conducted in the vacuum or dark or without photocatalyst or TEOA.The target products were undetectable in these catalytic systems (Table S3 ).Importantly, the photostability of MIL-100(Fe) was evaluated using recycling experiments.As shown in Fig. S19 , MIL-100(Fe) exhibits the long-term photocatalytic stability after multiple uninterrupted cycles.Corresponding SEM image, PXRD pattern and XPS spectra after the photocatalysis were shown in Figs.S20-S22 .The post-catalyst retained the octahedral morphology after multiple photocatalytic test, except that its surface became rough.These results demonstrate that the morphology, crystalline-structure and oxidation state of MIL-100(Fe) have no noticeable alteration, confirming the structural robustness. DFT calculations were performed to get further insight into the CO 2 -to-CH 4 reaction process. 4,616263 The computations are assuming converted proton-electron transfer and evaluated at 0 V vs. RHE.The Gibbs free energy diagrams of the reaction pathways are illustrated in Fig 5, the formation of COOH on MIL-100(Fe) and MIL-101(Fe) are endothermic processes with energy barriers of 1.906 and 2.005 eV, respectively.And the formation of COOH is considered as the rate-determining step S4 ), which demonstrated that the MIL-100(Fe) would be a more efficient photocatalyst for CO 2 reduction.Besides, the CO temperatureprogrammed desorption (TPD) measurement was employed to reveal the CO desorption process on the photocatalyst surface (Fig. S25 ).The results suggest that the stronger interaction between CO and MIL-100(Fe) can more efficiently prevent CO to escape from the Fe-O clusters, which benefits for further hydrogenation of CO to generate CH 4 .This result is in agreement with the photocatalytic experiment, in which MIL-100(Fe) shows superior selectivity and reactivity for CO 2 -to-CH 4 .The choice of CO, HCHO and CH 3 OH feeds was based on the calculational results that all of them may constitute reactive intermediates of the catalytic process. 33,61,64 Terefore, taking the optimal catalyst of MIL-100(Fe), the photocatalytic experiment under CO, HCHO, and CH 3 OH were applied separately as feed reactants (Fig. S26 ), the result proved that CO, HCHO, and CH 3 OH are the intermediates for CH 4 formation, which is in line with the DFT predictions.This

The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 experiments were carried out in a batch-type reaction system (CEL-SPH2N-D9, CeAulight, China) equipped with a homemade gas-solid reactor (Fig. S1 ).The photocatalyst (2 mg) was uniformly dispersed into a circular glass-fibre membrane (0.22 m pore diameter) with an illuminated area of about 2.8 cm 2 .The membrane activated in vacuum at 150 C for 12 h.Subsequently, the membrane was installed in the reactor with the distance from the light source to the sample was 11 cm and TEOA (2mL) was added into the reactor.The reaction system was completely vacuumed and pumped with CO 2 gas.A 300 W xenon arc lamp (Sirius-300P, Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins Zolix Instruments Co., Ltd., China) with a 400-780 nm filter was used as the light source.The optical power density remained at 400 mW cm -2 measured by an optical power meter (CEL-NP2000-2, CeAulight, China).The gas products were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC-9860, Luchuang Instrument, China).The 13 CO 2 isotopic labelling was determined by using a gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (Trace GC Ultra, ThermoFisher Scientific)."}], "operation mode": [{"llm generation": "Batch", "source": "The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 experiments were carried out in a batch-type reaction system (CEL-SPH2N-D9, CeAulight, China) equipped with a homemade gas-solid reactor (Fig. S1 ).", "context": "All spin-polarized DFT computations were performed by using Vienna ab-initio simulation package (VASP) based on projector augmented wave (PAW) method. 4950051 Electron-ion interactions were described using standard PAW potentials with valence configurations of 2s 2 2p 6 3s 2 3d 6 for Fe, 2s 2 2p 2 for C, 2s 2 2p 4 for O, and 1s 1 for H. 52,53 A plane-wave basis set was employed to expand the smooth part of wave functions with a cut-off kinetic energy of 480 eV.For electron-electron exchange and correlation interactions, the functional parameterized by Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhhof (PBE), 54 a form of general gradient approximation (GGA), was used throughout.Due to insufficient consideration of the on-site Columbic repulsion, DFT might fail to describe the electronic structure of the MIL-100(Fe) and MIL-101(Fe).To overcome this shortcoming, the GGAU approach was used with U -J 6.0 eV for Fe atoms. 55Since the unit cells of MIL-100(Fe) and MIL-101(Fe) contain more than 10,000 atoms, the calculation on such big systems was beyond the computational power of current supercomputer.Considering that the building block of MIL-100(Fe) and MIL-101(Fe) is a super tetrahedral cell, which includes Fe 3 O(COO) 6 trimers connected by BTC or BDC ligands, the active reaction center for MIL-100(Fe) and MIL-101(Fe) is 5-coordinated metal ions in trimers for adsorption of CO 2 .A finite-size cluster model Fe 3 O trimer, which is cut from the periodic structure, was adopted to approximate the structure.The Brillouin-zone integrations were performed using the Gamma-point only grid.When the geometries were optimized, all atoms were allowed to relax.And the atomic structures were optimized until the residual forces were below 0.02 eV/A.Gas-phase molecules were treated using the ideal gas approximation, whereas adsorbates were treated using a harmonic approximation.The DFTcalculated energy for CO 2 was corrected by 0.45 eV, 56 a usual adjustment to correct the overestimation by DFT.H 2 O was calculated under 0.035 atm.The relative free energies were calculated based on the computational hydrogen electrode (CHE) model. 57he Gibbs free energy (G) of each reaction step is defined as the difference between the free energy of the reaction initiation and termination states, and the general formula is described as - where E DFT is the electronic energy obtained from DFT calculations of the catalysts, E ZPE is the change of zero-point energy, TS is the entropy contribution.Zero-point energies and entropies of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction of intermediates were computed from the vibrational frequencies.
