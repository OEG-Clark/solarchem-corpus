Ti-KIT-6 (calcined) materials were further characterized and evaluated by reaction to achieve the most optimized photocatalyst which would be discussed in later parts.The optimized Ti-KIT-6 was used in further optimization of the process and the key reaction parameters. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface area (S BET ), pore volume (PV), average pore diameter (APD), isotherms and pore size distributions (PSD) were measured on the powder materials, which had previously been outgassed at 150 C using a Micromeritics FlowPrep 060, USA (sample degas system), by means of N 2 sorption at 77 K on a Micromeritics Tristar II, USA (surface area and porosity) instrument.

FT-IR spectra were collected at a resolution of 2 cm A1 on a Perkin Elmer FT-IR spectrophotometer equipped with an MCT detector.The XPS spectra were recorded using a PHI 5000 Versa Probe (USA), with a scanning ESCA microscope fitted with an Al monochromatic X-ray source (1486.6 eV, 25.6 W), a beam diameter of 100 lm, a neutralizer at 1.4 eV, 20 mA, and in FAT analyzer mode.TEM images were taken at the thin edges of the sample particles using a TEM Philips CM12, with a LaB6 filament, double-tilt holder, operating at 120 kV. In order to have a viable application, the Ti-mesoporous silica photocatalyst cannot be used in powder form but needs to be shaped into a structured reactor.Different alternatives to powder are possible, and the following have been examined in this work: Scheme 1. Scheme for the synthesis of the materials. -Fine 500 micron pellets uniformly dispersed in the reactor; this provides the maximum available geometrical surface area exposed to light and for reactant adsorption.-A thin catalyst layer laid over an illuminated surface; this maximizes the geometrical surface area exposed by the photocatalyst and UV light. A 0.2 g sample of bare powder catalyst, which was dispersed over the same surface using a spatula, was prepared for comparison purposes. The basic experimental CO 2 photocatalytic reduction set-up is shown in Fig. 1.This set-up includes a Pyrex glass reactor, connectors, mass flow controllers (Bronkhorst, High-Tech), a water bubbler and a UV lamp (Newport/Oriel Instrument USA 200 W with a focusing lens assembly or Osram Ultra-Vitalux 300 W).The set-up also includes a CO 2 gas cylinder (99.99), a gas chromatograph (GC, Varian CP-3800) equipped with a capillary column (CP7381), a flame ionization detector (FID) and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD).A photocatalytic reaction was performed in the reactor, which contained 0.5 or 0.2 g of photocatalyst.The reactor and lines were purged with a He flow to remove the trapped air and the impurities.CO 2 gas 100 pure or after dilution (20) with He, was introduced into the reactor after having passed through the water bubbler and ensuring it was adsorption-desorption balanced in order to saturate the catalyst with CO 2 and H 2 O.When equilibrium was reached, the UV light was turned on and the reaction products were analyzed by means of the GC.Blank tests were also conducted to ensure that the products were due to the photocatalytic reaction.The blank tests consisted of a UV-illumination without the photocatalyst and a reaction in the dark with the photocatalyst."}, {"llm generation": "Gas", "source": "Optimization of the novel synthesized Ti-mesoporous silica (SBA-15-S, KIT-6: calcined or dried) materials with different Si/Ti ratios (200, 100 and 50) has revealed that the Ti-KIT-6-calcined (Si/Ti 100) was the most optimized photocatalyst than the other materials explored in this study, in the activity of CO 2 reduction with water vapors to renewable fuels.", "context": "Optimization of the novel synthesized Ti-mesoporous silica (SBA-15-S, KIT-6: calcined or dried) materials with different Si/Ti ratios (200, 100 and 50) has revealed that the Ti-KIT-6-calcined (Si/Ti 100) was the most optimized photocatalyst than the other materials explored in this study, in the activity of CO 2 reduction with water vapors to renewable fuels.This was due to the presence of more accessible surface reaction active sites in the Ti-KIT-6-calcined (Si/Ti 100), which were due to the lower number of Ti-O-Ti or TiO 2 agglomerates, and to the more isolated Ti species, which were uniformly dispersed on the 3-D KIT-6 mesoporous silica support without collapsing the mesoporous structure.The increased surface concentrations of OH groups found in the Ti-KIT-6-calcined (Si/Ti 100) also boosted higher activity.The reaction mechanism indicates that the reaction proceeds mainly by the competitive adsorption of CO 2 and H 2 O vapors on the catalyst surface.The UV light source, UV intensity, H 2 O/CO 2 ratios and catalyst shapes are the key factors that influence the performance of the catalyst, and therefore, these parameters have here been optimized to increase the renewable fuel products.The partial saturation of the active adsorption sites by means of the products or by-products or mixture formation are supposed to be the main possible causes of the deactivation.The O 2 produced in the reaction is also considered as a redundant, as it might promote the deactivation by means of oxidation of the products back to CO 2 .A simple evaporation technique can quickly regenerate the photocatalyst.However, a separate in-depth study is recommended to explore the exact nature and the causes of these deactivating species.Moreover, one of the main hurdles to overcome for photocatalytic reaction to be practical is source of light to initiate the reaction.The wavelength of solar light is not sufficiently short for this scheme.However, CO 2 conversion utilizing solar energy is fundamentally very important for the sustainable future.Therefore, we hope that the development of the photocatalysis with nanomanufacturing will realize CO 2 reduction with solar energy in the near future.These findings indicate that the optimized photocatalyst is a promising candidate for this application in the future research.
