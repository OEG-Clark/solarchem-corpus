The structural analysis of doped TiO 2 nanotube arrays was usually carried out by using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy 14.Here, XRD measurements were performed to investigate the changes of phase structures of N-TiO 2 sample and V, N co-doped TNAs with various doping amounts.As shown in Figure 2, diffraction peaks of all samples were ascribed to pure anatase TiO 2 diffraction pattern consistent with the values in the standard card (JCPDS card no.21-1272) 15.No significant characteristic peak of vanadium species is found in corresponding XRD patterns.Numerous reports showed that the incorporation of transition metal ions into other compounds as dopant could distort the original crystal lattice of the doped materials 16.A detail analysis of XRD patterns was performed by enlarging the anatase (101) plane of the samples as shown in the inset of Figure 2. Compared with N-TiO 2 , the peak position of the V, N co-doped TNA samples gradually shifted toward a higher diffraction angle.It suggests that the V ions might be successfully incorporated into the crystal lattice of anatase TiO 2 as vanadyl groups (V 4 ) or polymeric vanadates (V 5 ) and substituted for Ti 4 because the ionic radii of V 4 (0.72 A) and V 5 (0.68 A) were both slightly smaller than that of Ti 4 (0.75 A) 17.However, peak position change of VN5 was not obvious, indicating that the doped V ions might be excessive and aggregate on the surface of TNAs and then inhibit the incorporation of ions into crystal lattice.For VN0 sample without co-doping, its crystal lattice did not change through the hydrothermal process and kept the similar peak position with N-TiO 2 sample. Figure 3 shows the high-resolution XPS spectra of Ti 2p, O 1 s, N 1 s, and V 2p regions for N-TiO 2 , VN0, and VN3 samples.A significant negative shift is found for Ti 2p in Figure 3a and O 1 s in Figure 3b when V and N were co-doped into TiO 2 by hydrothermal process.The measured binding energies of Ti 2p 3/2 and O 1 s for N-TiO 2 and VN0 are 458.7 and 529.9 eV, respectively.As compared to N-TiO 2 and VN0, the binding energy of Ti 2p 3/2 for the VN3 sample is shifted to 458.5 eV.The lower binding energy of Ti 2p in co-doped TiO 2 suggests the different electronic interactions of Ti with ions and substitutes for Ti 9, which further justifies the incorporation of vanadium and nitrogen into the TiO 2 lattice.The binding energy of O 1 s of TiO 2 lattice oxygen (Ti-O-Ti) for the VN3 sample is also shifted to 529.6 eV.Oxygen molecules can be dissociatively absorbed on the oxygen vacancies induced by doping N, thereby leading to a slight shift to lower binding energy of O 1 s of TiO 2 lattice oxygen (Ti-O-Ti) 18. Figure 3c shows the high-resolution XPS spectra and corresponding fitted XPS for the N 1 s region of N-TiO 2 , VN0, and VN3.A broad peak extending from 397 to 403 eV is observed for all samples.The center of the N 1 s peak locates at ca. 399.7, 399.6, and 399.4 eV for N-TiO 2 , VN0, and VN3 samples, respectively.These three peaks are higher than that of typical binding energy of N 1 s (396.9 eV) in TiN 19, indicating that the N atoms in all samples interact strongly with O atoms 20.The binding energies of 399.7, 399.6, and 399.4 eV here are attributed to the oxidized nitrogen similar to NO x species, which means Ti-N-O linkage possibly formed on the surface of N-TiO 2 , VN0, and VN3 samples 212223.The concentrations of V and N in VN3 derived from XPS analysis were 3.38 and 4.21 (at.), respectively.The molar ratios of N/Ti on the surface of N-TiO 2 and VN3 were 2.89 and 14.04, respectively, indicating obvious increase of N doping content by hydrothermal treatment with ammonium metavanadate.As shown in Figure 3d, the peaks appearing at 516.3, 516.9, 523.8, and 524.4 eV could be attributed to 2p 3/2 of V 4 , 2p 3/2 of V 5 , 2p 1/2 of V 4 , and 2p 1/2 of V 5 24,25.It was established that the V 4 and V 5 ions were successfully incorporated into the crystal lattice of anatase TiO 2 and substituted for Ti 4 ions. UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of N-TiO 2 and V, N codoped TiO 2 nanotube arrays are displayed in Figure 4.The spectrum obtained from the N-TiO 2 shows that N-TiO 2 primarily absorbs the ultraviolet light with a wavelength below 400 nm.For the V, N co-doped TNAs samples of VN0.5 and VN1, the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) spectra present a small red shift of adsorption edge and a higher visible light absorbance.With the increase of co-doping amount, an obvious red shift of the absorption edge and enhanced visible light absorbance were observed for the VN3 and VN5 samples.However, no obvious change of visible light absorbance was found for VN0, which indicates that the visible light absorbance of co-doped samples may be due to the contribution of both interstitially doped N and substitutionally doped V. Kubelka-Munk function was used to estimate the band gap energy of all samples by plotting ( hv) When the dopant exists in an optimal doping concentration, V 4 and V 5 can easily substitute Ti 4 in the TiO 2 lattice, which might produce the new energy level and extend the light adsorption of TiO 2 due to the fact that ionic radius of V 4 and V 5 were both slightly smaller than that of Ti 4 17.Overall, the UV-vis DRS results indicate that N and V co-doped TiO 2 nanotube arrays are more sensitive to the visible light than N-TiO 2 samples. A series of the photoelectrochemical (PEC) experiments were carried out to investigate the effect of the V, N co- doping of TNAs films on the charge carriers separation and electron transfer processes.As shown in Figure 5, prompt generation of photocurrents was observed for all TNA samples upon illumination at an applied potential of 0.4 V vs. SCE.All samples showed good photoresponses and highly reproducible for numerous on-off cycles under the light on and light off conditions.The V, N co-doped TNAs exhibited higher photocurrents than that of N-TiO 2 samples under UV irradiation.Herein, N-TiO 2 electrode shows that only a lower photocurrent density of 2.5 mA/cm 2 may be due to the rapid recombination of charge carriers.With the co-doping of V and N, the VN3 sample exhibited highest photocurrent (5.0 mA/cm 2 ) with optimal concentration.These results further inferred that V, N co-doped TiO 2 nanotube arrays possess good photoresponsivity to generate and separate photo-induced electrons and holes 26.Excessive vanadium and nitrogen content caused the detrimental effect, which acted as recombination centers to trap the charge carriers and resulted in low quantum yields 2,27.From the PEC experimental results, optimum content of V and N co-doped into TiO 2 play an important role in maximizing the photocurrent density mainly attributed to the effective charge carrier separation and improve the charge carrier transportation. Photoreduction of CO 2 to methane were performed as a probe reaction to evaluate the photocatalytic activity of the V, N co-doped TNA films.During the CO 2 photoreduction reaction, the increase of CH 4 concentration (ppm/cm 2 , CH 4 , which is the difference between CH 4 concentration at t reaction time and the initial time) was used to evaluate the photocatalytic performance.As shown in Figure 6, concentration of CH 4 increased almost linearly with the UV irradiation time for the photocatalyst.V and N co-doped TNAs possess much higher photocatalytic activity than N-TiO 2 and VN0 sample hydrothermal treated in pure water.Moreover, photoreduction activity of V, N co-doped TNAs was enhanced and then decreased with the increase of doping content of vanadium and nitrogen.VN3 sample had the highest methane yield of 64.5 ppm h -1 cm -2 .For comparison, reference reactions without catalysts or light irradiation were performed with other conditions being kept unchanged.All results indicated that there was almost no methane production when the experiment was carried out in the absence of catalysts or irradiation.We also investigated the effect of hydrothermal treatment on the photocatalytic activity.VN0 sample was obtained by the hydrothermal treatment of N-TiO 2 in pure water and used as a photocatalyst.A slightly enhanced photocatalytic activity was found for VN0 sample as shown in Figure 6.This hydrothermal-assisted photocatalytic enhancement results are also confirmed by some researchers 28,29.All results indicate that photoexcited process of V, N co-doped TNAs is essential in photoreduction process of CO 2 .However, for VN5 sample, the reduction activity is the lowest one because a further increase in the vanadium content would result in the aggregation of dopant nanoparticles, fast recombination of hole and electron pairs, and excess oxygen vacancies and Ti 3 defects state induced by nitrogen doping also served as recombination centers 30. The photoreduction reaction of CO 2 over VN3 sample was also repeated to check the durability of photocatalyst. Figure 7 shows the CH 4 formation by VN3 sample for three times.After each cycle (6 h irradiation), the reaction vessel was degassed, then CO 2 and water vapor was introduced into it again.The photocatalytic activity could be restored after three cycles.In each cycle, the initial CH 4 evolution rate was recovered, and there was no CH 4 formation evolved when the light was off.The above durability results indicate that the V, N co-doped TNAs were stable under the present experimental conditions during the long irradiation time. When TNAs were radiated by the light with photon energy higher or equal to the band gaps of TiO 2 , more electrons and holes induced by V and N co-doping lead to the reduction of CO 2 successfully.Previous studies revealed the trapping of the excited electron and hole by oxygen vacancy and doped nitrogen respectively reduced the recombination rate.The presence of nitrogen dopants was considered to reduce the formation energy of oxygen vacancies 31.At the same time, the existence of O vacancies stabilized the N impurities 32.When oxygen vacancies and N impurities are incorporated together, there is an electron transfer from the higher energy 3d band of Ti 3 to the lower energy 2p band of the nitrogen impurities 33.The efficient separation and transfer of election-hole pairs might also be associated with the interaction of V 4 and V 5 .The V 5 species reacted with the electrons to yield V 4 species, which on surface oxygen molecules generated the oxidant superoxide radical ion O 2 -.O 2 -reacted with H to produce hydroxyl radical and H and CO 2 trapped electrons to produce H and CO 2 -, which further reacted with holes to yield the final product, methane 34. Superabundant V and N could result in a decrease of photoreduction activity for increasing recombination centers of electrons and holes."}, {"llm generation": "UV-vis", "source": "Photocurrent density(mA/cm 2 ) Figure 4 UV-vis spectra and energy of absorbed light plot.", "context": "V-N co-doped TiO 2 nanotube arrays have been fabricated by a simple two-step method.V and N co-doped TiO 2 photocatalysts exhibit fine tubular structures after hydrothermal co-doping process.XPS data reveal that N is found in the forms of Ti-N-O and V incorporates into the TiO 2 lattice in V-N co-doped TNAs.V and N codoping result in remarkably enhanced activity for CO 2 photoreduction to CH 4 due to the effective separation of electron-hole pairs.Meanwhile, the unique structure of co-doped TiO 2 nanotube arrays promoted the electron transfer and the substance diffusion.

The structural analysis of doped TiO 2 nanotube arrays was usually carried out by using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy 14.Here, XRD measurements were performed to investigate the changes of phase structures of N-TiO 2 sample and V, N co-doped TNAs with various doping amounts.As shown in Figure 2, diffraction peaks of all samples were ascribed to pure anatase TiO 2 diffraction pattern consistent with the values in the standard card (JCPDS card no.21-1272) 15.No significant characteristic peak of vanadium species is found in corresponding XRD patterns.Numerous reports showed that the incorporation of transition metal ions into other compounds as dopant could distort the original crystal lattice of the doped materials 16.A detail analysis of XRD patterns was performed by enlarging the anatase (101) plane of the samples as shown in the inset of Figure 2. Compared with N-TiO 2 , the peak position of the V, N co-doped TNA samples gradually shifted toward a higher diffraction angle.It suggests that the V ions might be successfully incorporated into the crystal lattice of anatase TiO 2 as vanadyl groups (V 4 ) or polymeric vanadates (V 5 ) and substituted for Ti 4 because the ionic radii of V 4 (0.72 A) and V 5 (0.68 A) were both slightly smaller than that of Ti 4 (0.75 A) 17.However, peak position change of VN5 was not obvious, indicating that the doped V ions might be excessive and aggregate on the surface of TNAs and then inhibit the incorporation of ions into crystal lattice.For VN0 sample without co-doping, its crystal lattice did not change through the hydrothermal process and kept the similar peak position with N-TiO 2 sample. Figure 3 shows the high-resolution XPS spectra of Ti 2p, O 1 s, N 1 s, and V 2p regions for N-TiO 2 , VN0, and VN3 samples.A significant negative shift is found for Ti 2p in Figure 3a and O 1 s in Figure 3b when V and N were co-doped into TiO 2 by hydrothermal process.The measured binding energies of Ti 2p 3/2 and O 1 s for N-TiO 2 and VN0 are 458.7 and 529.9 eV, respectively.As compared to N-TiO 2 and VN0, the binding energy of Ti 2p 3/2 for the VN3 sample is shifted to 458.5 eV.The lower binding energy of Ti 2p in co-doped TiO 2 suggests the different electronic interactions of Ti with ions and substitutes for Ti 9, which further justifies the incorporation of vanadium and nitrogen into the TiO 2 lattice.The binding energy of O 1 s of TiO 2 lattice oxygen (Ti-O-Ti) for the VN3 sample is also shifted to 529.6 eV.Oxygen molecules can be dissociatively absorbed on the oxygen vacancies induced by doping N, thereby leading to a slight shift to lower binding energy of O 1 s of TiO 2 lattice oxygen (Ti-O-Ti) 18. Figure 3c shows the high-resolution XPS spectra and corresponding fitted XPS for the N 1 s region of N-TiO 2 , VN0, and VN3.A broad peak extending from 397 to 403 eV is observed for all samples.The center of the N 1 s peak locates at ca. 399.7, 399.6, and 399.4 eV for N-TiO 2 , VN0, and VN3 samples, respectively.These three peaks are higher than that of typical binding energy of N 1 s (396.9 eV) in TiN 19, indicating that the N atoms in all samples interact strongly with O atoms 20.The binding energies of 399.7, 399.6, and 399.4 eV here are attributed to the oxidized nitrogen similar to NO x species, which means Ti-N-O linkage possibly formed on the surface of N-TiO 2 , VN0, and VN3 samples 212223.The concentrations of V and N in VN3 derived from XPS analysis were 3.38 and 4.21 (at.), respectively.The molar ratios of N/Ti on the surface of N-TiO 2 and VN3 were 2.89 and 14.04, respectively, indicating obvious increase of N doping content by hydrothermal treatment with ammonium metavanadate.As shown in Figure 3d, the peaks appearing at 516.3, 516.9, 523.8, and 524.4 eV could be attributed to 2p 3/2 of V 4 , 2p 3/2 of V 5 , 2p 1/2 of V 4 , and 2p 1/2 of V 5 24,25.It was established that the V 4 and V 5 ions were successfully incorporated into the crystal lattice of anatase TiO 2 and substituted for Ti 4 ions. UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of N-TiO 2 and V, N codoped TiO 2 nanotube arrays are displayed in Figure 4.The spectrum obtained from the N-TiO 2 shows that N-TiO 2 primarily absorbs the ultraviolet light with a wavelength below 400 nm.For the V, N co-doped TNAs samples of VN0.5 and VN1, the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) spectra present a small red shift of adsorption edge and a higher visible light absorbance.With the increase of co-doping amount, an obvious red shift of the absorption edge and enhanced visible light absorbance were observed for the VN3 and VN5 samples.However, no obvious change of visible light absorbance was found for VN0, which indicates that the visible light absorbance of co-doped samples may be due to the contribution of both interstitially doped N and substitutionally doped V. Kubelka-Munk function was used to estimate the band gap energy of all samples by plotting ( hv) When the dopant exists in an optimal doping concentration, V 4 and V 5 can easily substitute Ti 4 in the TiO 2 lattice, which might produce the new energy level and extend the light adsorption of TiO 2 due to the fact that ionic radius of V 4 and V 5 were both slightly smaller than that of Ti 4 17.Overall, the UV-vis DRS results indicate that N and V co-doped TiO 2 nanotube arrays are more sensitive to the visible light than N-TiO 2 samples. A series of the photoelectrochemical (PEC) experiments were carried out to investigate the effect of the V, N co- doping of TNAs films on the charge carriers separation and electron transfer processes.As shown in Figure 5, prompt generation of photocurrents was observed for all TNA samples upon illumination at an applied potential of 0.4 V vs. SCE.All samples showed good photoresponses and highly reproducible for numerous on-off cycles under the light on and light off conditions.The V, N co-doped TNAs exhibited higher photocurrents than that of N-TiO 2 samples under UV irradiation.Herein, N-TiO 2 electrode shows that only a lower photocurrent density of 2.5 mA/cm 2 may be due to the rapid recombination of charge carriers.With the co-doping of V and N, the VN3 sample exhibited highest photocurrent (5.0 mA/cm 2 ) with optimal concentration.These results further inferred that V, N co-doped TiO 2 nanotube arrays possess good photoresponsivity to generate and separate photo-induced electrons and holes 26.Excessive vanadium and nitrogen content caused the detrimental effect, which acted as recombination centers to trap the charge carriers and resulted in low quantum yields 2,27.From the PEC experimental results, optimum content of V and N co-doped into TiO 2 play an important role in maximizing the photocurrent density mainly attributed to the effective charge carrier separation and improve the charge carrier transportation. Photoreduction of CO 2 to methane were performed as a probe reaction to evaluate the photocatalytic activity of the V, N co-doped TNA films.During the CO 2 photoreduction reaction, the increase of CH 4 concentration (ppm/cm 2 , CH 4 , which is the difference between CH 4 concentration at t reaction time and the initial time) was used to evaluate the photocatalytic performance.As shown in Figure 6, concentration of CH 4 increased almost linearly with the UV irradiation time for the photocatalyst.V and N co-doped TNAs possess much higher photocatalytic activity than N-TiO 2 and VN0 sample hydrothermal treated in pure water.Moreover, photoreduction activity of V, N co-doped TNAs was enhanced and then decreased with the increase of doping content of vanadium and nitrogen.VN3 sample had the highest methane yield of 64.5 ppm h -1 cm -2 .For comparison, reference reactions without catalysts or light irradiation were performed with other conditions being kept unchanged.All results indicated that there was almost no methane production when the experiment was carried out in the absence of catalysts or irradiation.We also investigated the effect of hydrothermal treatment on the photocatalytic activity.VN0 sample was obtained by the hydrothermal treatment of N-TiO 2 in pure water and used as a photocatalyst.A slightly enhanced photocatalytic activity was found for VN0 sample as shown in Figure 6.This hydrothermal-assisted photocatalytic enhancement results are also confirmed by some researchers 28,29.All results indicate that photoexcited process of V, N co-doped TNAs is essential in photoreduction process of CO 2 .However, for VN5 sample, the reduction activity is the lowest one because a further increase in the vanadium content would result in the aggregation of dopant nanoparticles, fast recombination of hole and electron pairs, and excess oxygen vacancies and Ti 3 defects state induced by nitrogen doping also served as recombination centers 30. The photoreduction reaction of CO 2 over VN3 sample was also repeated to check the durability of photocatalyst. Figure 7 shows the CH 4 formation by VN3 sample for three times.After each cycle (6 h irradiation), the reaction vessel was degassed, then CO 2 and water vapor was introduced into it again.The photocatalytic activity could be restored after three cycles.In each cycle, the initial CH 4 evolution rate was recovered, and there was no CH 4 formation evolved when the light was off.The above durability results indicate that the V, N co-doped TNAs were stable under the present experimental conditions during the long irradiation time. When TNAs were radiated by the light with photon energy higher or equal to the band gaps of TiO 2 , more electrons and holes induced by V and N co-doping lead to the reduction of CO 2 successfully.Previous studies revealed the trapping of the excited electron and hole by oxygen vacancy and doped nitrogen respectively reduced the recombination rate.The presence of nitrogen dopants was considered to reduce the formation energy of oxygen vacancies 31.At the same time, the existence of O vacancies stabilized the N impurities 32.When oxygen vacancies and N impurities are incorporated together, there is an electron transfer from the higher energy 3d band of Ti 3 to the lower energy 2p band of the nitrogen impurities 33.The efficient separation and transfer of election-hole pairs might also be associated with the interaction of V 4 and V 5 .The V 5 species reacted with the electrons to yield V 4 species, which on surface oxygen molecules generated the oxidant superoxide radical ion O 2 -.O 2 -reacted with H to produce hydroxyl radical and H and CO 2 trapped electrons to produce H and CO 2 -, which further reacted with holes to yield the final product, methane 34. Superabundant V and N could result in a decrease of photoreduction activity for increasing recombination centers of electrons and holes."}]}}
