We examined the surface chemical binding of CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0) materials with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Fig. S2y).The peaks of Cs 3d of CsPbBr 3 (x 1) at 724.0 and 738.1 eV are gradually red-shift to 723.8 and 737.8 eV (CsPbCl 3 , x 0), respectively (Fig. 3a).For the peaks of Pb 4f, they individually exhibit blue-shift from 137.8 and 142.7 eV of CsPbBr 3 to 138.0 and 142.9 eV of CsPbCl 3 (Fig. 3b).These indicate that bonding environment of Cs and Pb atoms is changed via tuning the ratios of Br/Cl.The peaks of Br 3d and/or Cl 2p in CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0) are almost unchanged (Fig. 3c,d).To better understand the actual ratio of Br/Cl in the synthesized perovskites, the elemental analysis is carried out by ICP-MS (Table S1y), which indicates that the actual ratio is generally consistent with the molar feed ratio. In the following experiments, we studied the optical properties of CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 materials.Firstly, using ethyl acetate as a solvent, light absorption property of CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 was measured.CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 exhibit a good absorption toward the visible light, ranging from 400 to 700 nm (Fig. 4a), which is quite wider than the typical semiconductors, such as TiO 2 , ZnO 6,49,50.With x value increases, the absorption peaking at 520 nm (CsPbBr 3 ) gradually shifts to 420 nm (CsPbCl 3 ).For semiconductor, the band edge positions have a significant influence on the catalytic reactivity.Hence, the band edge positions of CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0) materials were studied.First, the band gap (E g ) of them was decided by UV-vis diffuse reflection spectroscopy (DRS, Fig. S3y) based on Tauc method 51.Fig. 4b shows the (ahm) 2 versus hm curves of CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0) materials with a direct band gap 52.The E g values of CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0) were from 2.33 to 2.98 eV (Table 1) based on the Xaxis intercept of the Tauc plot.The valence band (E VB ) of CsPb (Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0) materials are determined by Valence-band XPS (VB XPS, Fig. 4c and Fig. S4y).The conduction band (E CB ) are determined by the equation 53: According to the band edge positions in Table 1, we can find that E VB enhanced with the increase of Cl content in CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 , while very little change of E CB was observed.Thus, the E VB depends more strongly on the halide composition than E CB .In addition, E CB levels of all as-prepared halide perovskites are higher than the reductive potential of CO 2 to CO (A0.5 eV).Under the excitation of 362 nm (except CsPbCl 3 which was excited by 320 nm), emission spectra of CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0) materials were collected.The emission band peaking at 517 nm is observed on CsPbBr 3 and with the enhancement of Cl content, the peak is gradually shifted to 413 nm (Fig. 4d).To investigate the catalytic activity of mixed-halide perovskite toward CO 2 reduction, the catalytic experiment was carried out following the reaction condition reported by Su and co-workers in which only perovskites and ethyl acetate were used in the system 42.As a control experiment, the catalytic activity of CsPbBr 3 and CsPbCl 3 was also investigated.Firstly, a certain amount of halide perovskites was put into a quartz tube containing 6 mL ethyl acetate.After irradiation by Xe-300 lamp with AM 1.5 filter within 9 h, CO and CH 4 are generated as the main gas product and the yield is changed with the alteration of Br/Cl ratios in perovskites (Fig. 5a, Tables S2y andS3y).With CsPbBr 3 as a catalyst, the yield of CO and CH 4 is 135 and 60 lmol/g, respectively.After displacing Br with Cl at x 0.7, the yield of CO and CH 4 enhances slightly up to 156 and 72 lmol/g.When using CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 as a catalyst, the CO generation undergoes a sharp increase to 767 lmol/g which is 5.7-fold and 4.9-fold higher than that of pure CsPbBr 3 and CsPb(Br 0.7 /Cl 0.3 ) 3 , while CH 4 only exhibits a slight enhancement (108 lmol/g) (Fig. S5ay).However, further enhancing the Cl content (x 0.3 or 0), the production amount of CO and CH 4 in CsPb(Br 0.3 /Cl 0.7 ) 3 or CsPbCl 3 presents an obvious decrease.From these results, we can find Cl introduction has a significant influence on the activity of CO 2 reduction in this photocatalytic system.The optimal catalyst is CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 with a total catalytic yield of CO and CH 4 up to 875 lmol/g which is around 4.5 and 9.1 times higher than the performance of CsPbBr 3 and CsPbCl 3 materials.What's more, the common byproduct H 2 is avoided in all of CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 catalyst and the selectivity toward CO and CH 4 is up to 99. CsPbBr 3 QDs with the orthorhombic phase are first reported as a photocatalyst for CO 2 photoreduction 42.To get an unambiguous evaluation about mixed-halide strategy in CO 2 photoreduction, the orthorhombic CsPbBr 3 sample was employed as a catalyst in our experimental condition (Fig. S5by).After 9 h reaction, around 112 lmol/g CO and 33 lmol/g CH 4 are produced and the total generation amount (145 lmol/g) is 1/6 of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 and comparable with that of cubic CsPbBr 3 (195 lmol/g).Compared with the mixed-halide strategy, crystal phase (orthorhombic or cubic) has a little effect on the CO 2 photoreduction performance.Moreover, the total yield of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 perovskite toward CO 2 reduction is much better than that of reported popular catalysts, such as TiO 2 , CdS and g-C 3 N 4 under similar condition (Table S4y).To better confirm the advantage of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 perovskite over these materials in CO 2 reduction, the activity of g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets and TiO 2 (P25) were studied under the same catalytic condition (Table S5y).The photocatalytic results demonstrate that the reactivity of g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets and TiO 2 (P25) is around 10-fold and 5-fold lower than that of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 respectively. The CO 2 photoreduction activity of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 materials within different time was investigated by detecting the amounts of CO and CH 4 every three hours (Fig. 5b).Within the period, the outputs of CO and CH 4 are 250 20 and 25.0 2 lmol/g, respectively.These results present that CO and CH 4 almost linearly increase during the 9 h irradiation.These results imply that CsPb (Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 materials might have a moderate stability during photocatalysis.To compare the performance of different catalysts via tuning ratios of Br/Cl during different reaction time, the experiments were carried out (Fig. S6y).The higher generation speed of CO than that of CH 4 may result from the needed multi-electrons pathway in CH 4 formation.The decrease of CH 4 amount after 9 h reaction may ascribe to the discontinuous irradiation which severely affects electrons accumulation to feed 8 electrons route. The control experiment was investigated to determine the source of the gas product under an inert Ar gas atmosphere.After 9 h irradiation, CO and CO 2 were generated with the amount of 94 and 430 lmol/g by CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 , respectively.The CO yield under Ar is around one-in-eight of that under saturated CO 2 (767 lmol/g) which means that a small quantity of CO generated from the photosynthesis system due to partial photooxidation of ethyl acetate.To further make sure the carbon source of the reaction product, gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC-MS) was used to detect CO under 13 CO 2 atmosphere using CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 as catalysts (Fig. 6).The result of isotopic experiment indicates that about 85 of CO comes from 13 CO 2 photoreduction. Besides activity, the stability of a catalyst is another significant factor affecting the catalytic efficiency.To illuminate the stability of mixed-halide perovskite materials, we studied the crystalline phase after photocatalysis.No obvious changes in PXRD patterns of CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 0.7, 0.5, 0.3) are observed after photocatalysis.Contrast to mixed-halide perovskite, the PXRD pattern of CsPbCl 3 after catalysis was kept intact but the one of CsPbBr 3 (Fig. 7a) shows a few new peaks (CsPb 2 Br 5 ).These results imply mixed-halide perovskite materials may have better stability than that of bare CsPbBr 3 , and indicate that the introduction of Cl in halide perovskite could be a promising way to enhance the stability of perovskite in CO 2 photoreduction to some extent. Considering the PXRD results, the reusable experiment was conducted (Fig. S7y).After second recycle (corresponding to 18 h reaction), around 42 and 56 decrease in CO and CH 4 generation with CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 as catalyst was observed, however, after third recycle (corresponding to 27 h reaction), the yield of both CO and CH 4 sharply reduced to 38 and 23.The decrease of catalytic activity may result from the moderate durability of perovskite materials under the long-time irradiation.For other CsPb (Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 0, 0.3, 0.7, 1), with the Cl content enhanced, the reduced degree in reactivity decreased.According to these experiments, the ratio of Br and Cl at 0.5:0.5 should be the most active rather than the most stable.The advantage in band energy and the moderate stability of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 may make it be the most appropriate catalyst for CO 2 photoreduction.Fig. 6.The GC-MS result of an isotopic experiment with 13 CO 2 as carbon sources using CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 as the catalyst.Given that charge separation plays a crucial role in the redox reaction, transient photocurrent responses were employed to reveal the rooted reason behind the predominant photocatalytic performance of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 materials in CO 2 reduction.First, the photoelectrodes were prepared and the thickness of the film cross-section was determined by SEM image of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 photoelectrode (Fig. S8y).The photocurrent responses were collected under Xe-300 lamp with AM 1.5 filter under dark and light conditions.In Fig. 7b, the photocurrent density of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 elevates rapidly up to 4.4 lA/cm 2 during light irradiation and then decreases sharply under the dark condition, which can be successively implemented for multiple times.Other mixed-halide perovskites CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 0.7, 0.3) have similar phenomena during on-off irradiation but with low photocurrent density.These results illuminate the charge separation of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 is more efficient than the other two mixed-halide perovskites.Together with the band energy and the advantage in moderate stability, CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 may be the most appropriate catalyst for CO 2 photoreduction."}, {"llm generation": "CsPbCl3 nanocrystals", "source": "As control in catalytic experiment, CsPbBr 3 and CsPbCl 3 nanocrystals were also prepared through the same approach.", "context": "The monodispersed mixed-halide perovskites CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 0.7, 0.5, 0.3) were synthesized according to the welldeveloped hot injection method 47.As control in catalytic experiment, CsPbBr 3 and CsPbCl 3 nanocrystals were also prepared through the same approach.Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns show a pure cubic phase of the as-prepared CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0) nanocrystals (Fig. 2e), which is consistent with the previous reports 47,48.Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images presented in Fig. 2a and Fig. S1y exhibit that all CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0) crystals are cubic shape with a size around 10.5 nm (Fig. 2c).Such small particle size will provide guarantee of a large specific surface area for catalysis.Depending on the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (Fig. 2b), the lattice parameter of the CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 materials is 0.57 nm suggesting the as-prepared materials are highly crystalline in perovskite structure.Moreover, the energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectra reveal the existence of Cs, Pb, Br and Cl elements in CsPb (Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 materials (Fig. 2d). We examined the surface chemical binding of CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0) materials with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Fig. S2y).The peaks of Cs 3d of CsPbBr 3 (x 1) at 724.0 and 738.1 eV are gradually red-shift to 723.8 and 737.8 eV (CsPbCl 3 , x 0), respectively (Fig. 3a).For the peaks of Pb 4f, they individually exhibit blue-shift from 137.8 and 142.7 eV of CsPbBr 3 to 138.0 and 142.9 eV of CsPbCl 3 (Fig. 3b).These indicate that bonding environment of Cs and Pb atoms is changed via tuning the ratios of Br/Cl.The peaks of Br 3d and/or Cl 2p in CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0) are almost unchanged (Fig. 3c,d).To better understand the actual ratio of Br/Cl in the synthesized perovskites, the elemental analysis is carried out by ICP-MS (Table S1y), which indicates that the actual ratio is generally consistent with the molar feed ratio.

Considering the PXRD results, the reusable experiment was conducted (Fig. S7y).After second recycle (corresponding to 18 h reaction), around 42 and 56 decrease in CO and CH 4 generation with CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 as catalyst was observed, however, after third recycle (corresponding to 27 h reaction), the yield of both CO and CH 4 sharply reduced to 38 and 23.The decrease of catalytic activity may result from the moderate durability of perovskite materials under the long-time irradiation.For other CsPb (Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 0, 0.3, 0.7, 1), with the Cl content enhanced, the reduced degree in reactivity decreased.According to these experiments, the ratio of Br and Cl at 0.5:0.5 should be the most active rather than the most stable.The advantage in band energy and the moderate stability of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 may make it be the most appropriate catalyst for CO 2 photoreduction.Fig. 6.The GC-MS result of an isotopic experiment with 13 CO 2 as carbon sources using CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 as the catalyst.Given that charge separation plays a crucial role in the redox reaction, transient photocurrent responses were employed to reveal the rooted reason behind the predominant photocatalytic performance of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 materials in CO 2 reduction.First, the photoelectrodes were prepared and the thickness of the film cross-section was determined by SEM image of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 photoelectrode (Fig. S8y).The photocurrent responses were collected under Xe-300 lamp with AM 1.5 filter under dark and light conditions.In Fig. 7b, the photocurrent density of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 elevates rapidly up to 4.4 lA/cm 2 during light irradiation and then decreases sharply under the dark condition, which can be successively implemented for multiple times.Other mixed-halide perovskites CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 0.7, 0.3) have similar phenomena during on-off irradiation but with low photocurrent density.These results illuminate the charge separation of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 is more efficient than the other two mixed-halide perovskites.Together with the band energy and the advantage in moderate stability, CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 may be the most appropriate catalyst for CO 2 photoreduction."}, {"llm generation": "mixed-halide perovskite", "source": "To investigate the catalytic activity of mixed-halide perovskite toward CO 2 reduction, the catalytic experiment was carried out following the reaction condition reported by Su and co-workers in which only perovskites and ethyl acetate were used in the system 42.", "context": "The monodispersed mixed-halide perovskites CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 0.7, 0.5, 0.3) were synthesized according to the welldeveloped hot injection method 47.As control in catalytic experiment, CsPbBr 3 and CsPbCl 3 nanocrystals were also prepared through the same approach.Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns show a pure cubic phase of the as-prepared CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0) nanocrystals (Fig. 2e), which is consistent with the previous reports 47,48.Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images presented in Fig. 2a and Fig. S1y exhibit that all CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0) crystals are cubic shape with a size around 10.5 nm (Fig. 2c).Such small particle size will provide guarantee of a large specific surface area for catalysis.Depending on the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (Fig. 2b), the lattice parameter of the CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 materials is 0.57 nm suggesting the as-prepared materials are highly crystalline in perovskite structure.Moreover, the energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectra reveal the existence of Cs, Pb, Br and Cl elements in CsPb (Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 materials (Fig. 2d). We examined the surface chemical binding of CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0) materials with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Fig. S2y).The peaks of Cs 3d of CsPbBr 3 (x 1) at 724.0 and 738.1 eV are gradually red-shift to 723.8 and 737.8 eV (CsPbCl 3 , x 0), respectively (Fig. 3a).For the peaks of Pb 4f, they individually exhibit blue-shift from 137.8 and 142.7 eV of CsPbBr 3 to 138.0 and 142.9 eV of CsPbCl 3 (Fig. 3b).These indicate that bonding environment of Cs and Pb atoms is changed via tuning the ratios of Br/Cl.The peaks of Br 3d and/or Cl 2p in CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0) are almost unchanged (Fig. 3c,d).To better understand the actual ratio of Br/Cl in the synthesized perovskites, the elemental analysis is carried out by ICP-MS (Table S1y), which indicates that the actual ratio is generally consistent with the molar feed ratio. In the following experiments, we studied the optical properties of CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 materials.Firstly, using ethyl acetate as a solvent, light absorption property of CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 was measured.CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 exhibit a good absorption toward the visible light, ranging from 400 to 700 nm (Fig. 4a), which is quite wider than the typical semiconductors, such as TiO 2 , ZnO 6,49,50.With x value increases, the absorption peaking at 520 nm (CsPbBr 3 ) gradually shifts to 420 nm (CsPbCl 3 ).For semiconductor, the band edge positions have a significant influence on the catalytic reactivity.Hence, the band edge positions of CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0) materials were studied.First, the band gap (E g ) of them was decided by UV-vis diffuse reflection spectroscopy (DRS, Fig. S3y) based on Tauc method 51.Fig. 4b shows the (ahm) 2 versus hm curves of CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0) materials with a direct band gap 52.The E g values of CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0) were from 2.33 to 2.98 eV (Table 1) based on the Xaxis intercept of the Tauc plot.The valence band (E VB ) of CsPb (Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0) materials are determined by Valence-band XPS (VB XPS, Fig. 4c and Fig. S4y).The conduction band (E CB ) are determined by the equation 53: According to the band edge positions in Table 1, we can find that E VB enhanced with the increase of Cl content in CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 , while very little change of E CB was observed.Thus, the E VB depends more strongly on the halide composition than E CB .In addition, E CB levels of all as-prepared halide perovskites are higher than the reductive potential of CO 2 to CO (A0.5 eV).Under the excitation of 362 nm (except CsPbCl 3 which was excited by 320 nm), emission spectra of CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0) materials were collected.The emission band peaking at 517 nm is observed on CsPbBr 3 and with the enhancement of Cl content, the peak is gradually shifted to 413 nm (Fig. 4d).To investigate the catalytic activity of mixed-halide perovskite toward CO 2 reduction, the catalytic experiment was carried out following the reaction condition reported by Su and co-workers in which only perovskites and ethyl acetate were used in the system 42.As a control experiment, the catalytic activity of CsPbBr 3 and CsPbCl 3 was also investigated.Firstly, a certain amount of halide perovskites was put into a quartz tube containing 6 mL ethyl acetate.After irradiation by Xe-300 lamp with AM 1.5 filter within 9 h, CO and CH 4 are generated as the main gas product and the yield is changed with the alteration of Br/Cl ratios in perovskites (Fig. 5a, Tables S2y andS3y).With CsPbBr 3 as a catalyst, the yield of CO and CH 4 is 135 and 60 lmol/g, respectively.After displacing Br with Cl at x 0.7, the yield of CO and CH 4 enhances slightly up to 156 and 72 lmol/g.When using CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 as a catalyst, the CO generation undergoes a sharp increase to 767 lmol/g which is 5.7-fold and 4.9-fold higher than that of pure CsPbBr 3 and CsPb(Br 0.7 /Cl 0.3 ) 3 , while CH 4 only exhibits a slight enhancement (108 lmol/g) (Fig. S5ay).However, further enhancing the Cl content (x 0.3 or 0), the production amount of CO and CH 4 in CsPb(Br 0.3 /Cl 0.7 ) 3 or CsPbCl 3 presents an obvious decrease.From these results, we can find Cl introduction has a significant influence on the activity of CO 2 reduction in this photocatalytic system.The optimal catalyst is CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 with a total catalytic yield of CO and CH 4 up to 875 lmol/g which is around 4.5 and 9.1 times higher than the performance of CsPbBr 3 and CsPbCl 3 materials.What's more, the common byproduct H 2 is avoided in all of CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 catalyst and the selectivity toward CO and CH 4 is up to 99. CsPbBr 3 QDs with the orthorhombic phase are first reported as a photocatalyst for CO 2 photoreduction 42.To get an unambiguous evaluation about mixed-halide strategy in CO 2 photoreduction, the orthorhombic CsPbBr 3 sample was employed as a catalyst in our experimental condition (Fig. S5by).After 9 h reaction, around 112 lmol/g CO and 33 lmol/g CH 4 are produced and the total generation amount (145 lmol/g) is 1/6 of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 and comparable with that of cubic CsPbBr 3 (195 lmol/g).Compared with the mixed-halide strategy, crystal phase (orthorhombic or cubic) has a little effect on the CO 2 photoreduction performance.Moreover, the total yield of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 perovskite toward CO 2 reduction is much better than that of reported popular catalysts, such as TiO 2 , CdS and g-C 3 N 4 under similar condition (Table S4y).To better confirm the advantage of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 perovskite over these materials in CO 2 reduction, the activity of g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets and TiO 2 (P25) were studied under the same catalytic condition (Table S5y).The photocatalytic results demonstrate that the reactivity of g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets and TiO 2 (P25) is around 10-fold and 5-fold lower than that of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 respectively. The CO 2 photoreduction activity of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 materials within different time was investigated by detecting the amounts of CO and CH 4 every three hours (Fig. 5b).Within the period, the outputs of CO and CH 4 are 250 20 and 25.0 2 lmol/g, respectively.These results present that CO and CH 4 almost linearly increase during the 9 h irradiation.These results imply that CsPb (Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 materials might have a moderate stability during photocatalysis.To compare the performance of different catalysts via tuning ratios of Br/Cl during different reaction time, the experiments were carried out (Fig. S6y).The higher generation speed of CO than that of CH 4 may result from the needed multi-electrons pathway in CH 4 formation.The decrease of CH 4 amount after 9 h reaction may ascribe to the discontinuous irradiation which severely affects electrons accumulation to feed 8 electrons route. The control experiment was investigated to determine the source of the gas product under an inert Ar gas atmosphere.After 9 h irradiation, CO and CO 2 were generated with the amount of 94 and 430 lmol/g by CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 , respectively.The CO yield under Ar is around one-in-eight of that under saturated CO 2 (767 lmol/g) which means that a small quantity of CO generated from the photosynthesis system due to partial photooxidation of ethyl acetate.To further make sure the carbon source of the reaction product, gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC-MS) was used to detect CO under 13 CO 2 atmosphere using CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 as catalysts (Fig. 6).The result of isotopic experiment indicates that about 85 of CO comes from 13 CO 2 photoreduction.

Besides activity, the stability of a catalyst is another significant factor affecting the catalytic efficiency.To illuminate the stability of mixed-halide perovskite materials, we studied the crystalline phase after photocatalysis.No obvious changes in PXRD patterns of CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 0.7, 0.5, 0.3) are observed after photocatalysis.Contrast to mixed-halide perovskite, the PXRD pattern of CsPbCl 3 after catalysis was kept intact but the one of CsPbBr 3 (Fig. 7a) shows a few new peaks (CsPb 2 Br 5 ).These results imply mixed-halide perovskite materials may have better stability than that of bare CsPbBr 3 , and indicate that the introduction of Cl in halide perovskite could be a promising way to enhance the stability of perovskite in CO 2 photoreduction to some extent. Considering the PXRD results, the reusable experiment was conducted (Fig. S7y).After second recycle (corresponding to 18 h reaction), around 42 and 56 decrease in CO and CH 4 generation with CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 as catalyst was observed, however, after third recycle (corresponding to 27 h reaction), the yield of both CO and CH 4 sharply reduced to 38 and 23.The decrease of catalytic activity may result from the moderate durability of perovskite materials under the long-time irradiation.For other CsPb (Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 0, 0.3, 0.7, 1), with the Cl content enhanced, the reduced degree in reactivity decreased.According to these experiments, the ratio of Br and Cl at 0.5:0.5 should be the most active rather than the most stable.The advantage in band energy and the moderate stability of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 may make it be the most appropriate catalyst for CO 2 photoreduction.Fig. 6.The GC-MS result of an isotopic experiment with 13 CO 2 as carbon sources using CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 as the catalyst.Given that charge separation plays a crucial role in the redox reaction, transient photocurrent responses were employed to reveal the rooted reason behind the predominant photocatalytic performance of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 materials in CO 2 reduction.First, the photoelectrodes were prepared and the thickness of the film cross-section was determined by SEM image of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 photoelectrode (Fig. S8y).The photocurrent responses were collected under Xe-300 lamp with AM 1.5 filter under dark and light conditions.In Fig. 7b, the photocurrent density of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 elevates rapidly up to 4.4 lA/cm 2 during light irradiation and then decreases sharply under the dark condition, which can be successively implemented for multiple times.Other mixed-halide perovskites CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 0.7, 0.3) have similar phenomena during on-off irradiation but with low photocurrent density.These results illuminate the charge separation of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 is more efficient than the other two mixed-halide perovskites.Together with the band energy and the advantage in moderate stability, CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 may be the most appropriate catalyst for CO 2 photoreduction."}, {"llm generation": "CsPbBr3", "source": "The optimal catalyst is CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 with a total catalytic yield of CO and CH 4 up to 875 lmol/g which is around 4.5 and 9.1 times higher than the performance of CsPbBr 3 and CsPbCl 3 materials.", "context": "The monodispersed mixed-halide perovskites CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 0.7, 0.5, 0.3) were synthesized according to the welldeveloped hot injection method 47.As control in catalytic experiment, CsPbBr 3 and CsPbCl 3 nanocrystals were also prepared through the same approach.Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns show a pure cubic phase of the as-prepared CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0) nanocrystals (Fig. 2e), which is consistent with the previous reports 47,48.Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images presented in Fig. 2a and Fig. S1y exhibit that all CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0) crystals are cubic shape with a size around 10.5 nm (Fig. 2c).Such small particle size will provide guarantee of a large specific surface area for catalysis.Depending on the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (Fig. 2b), the lattice parameter of the CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 materials is 0.57 nm suggesting the as-prepared materials are highly crystalline in perovskite structure.Moreover, the energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectra reveal the existence of Cs, Pb, Br and Cl elements in CsPb (Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 materials (Fig. 2d). We examined the surface chemical binding of CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0) materials with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Fig. S2y).The peaks of Cs 3d of CsPbBr 3 (x 1) at 724.0 and 738.1 eV are gradually red-shift to 723.8 and 737.8 eV (CsPbCl 3 , x 0), respectively (Fig. 3a).For the peaks of Pb 4f, they individually exhibit blue-shift from 137.8 and 142.7 eV of CsPbBr 3 to 138.0 and 142.9 eV of CsPbCl 3 (Fig. 3b).These indicate that bonding environment of Cs and Pb atoms is changed via tuning the ratios of Br/Cl.The peaks of Br 3d and/or Cl 2p in CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0) are almost unchanged (Fig. 3c,d).To better understand the actual ratio of Br/Cl in the synthesized perovskites, the elemental analysis is carried out by ICP-MS (Table S1y), which indicates that the actual ratio is generally consistent with the molar feed ratio. In the following experiments, we studied the optical properties of CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 materials.Firstly, using ethyl acetate as a solvent, light absorption property of CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 was measured.CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 exhibit a good absorption toward the visible light, ranging from 400 to 700 nm (Fig. 4a), which is quite wider than the typical semiconductors, such as TiO 2 , ZnO 6,49,50.With x value increases, the absorption peaking at 520 nm (CsPbBr 3 ) gradually shifts to 420 nm (CsPbCl 3 ).For semiconductor, the band edge positions have a significant influence on the catalytic reactivity.Hence, the band edge positions of CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0) materials were studied.First, the band gap (E g ) of them was decided by UV-vis diffuse reflection spectroscopy (DRS, Fig. S3y) based on Tauc method 51.Fig. 4b shows the (ahm) 2 versus hm curves of CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0) materials with a direct band gap 52.The E g values of CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0) were from 2.33 to 2.98 eV (Table 1) based on the Xaxis intercept of the Tauc plot.The valence band (E VB ) of CsPb (Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0) materials are determined by Valence-band XPS (VB XPS, Fig. 4c and Fig. S4y).The conduction band (E CB ) are determined by the equation 53: According to the band edge positions in Table 1, we can find that E VB enhanced with the increase of Cl content in CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 , while very little change of E CB was observed.Thus, the E VB depends more strongly on the halide composition than E CB .In addition, E CB levels of all as-prepared halide perovskites are higher than the reductive potential of CO 2 to CO (A0.5 eV).Under the excitation of 362 nm (except CsPbCl 3 which was excited by 320 nm), emission spectra of CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0) materials were collected.The emission band peaking at 517 nm is observed on CsPbBr 3 and with the enhancement of Cl content, the peak is gradually shifted to 413 nm (Fig. 4d).To investigate the catalytic activity of mixed-halide perovskite toward CO 2 reduction, the catalytic experiment was carried out following the reaction condition reported by Su and co-workers in which only perovskites and ethyl acetate were used in the system 42.As a control experiment, the catalytic activity of CsPbBr 3 and CsPbCl 3 was also investigated.Firstly, a certain amount of halide perovskites was put into a quartz tube containing 6 mL ethyl acetate.After irradiation by Xe-300 lamp with AM 1.5 filter within 9 h, CO and CH 4 are generated as the main gas product and the yield is changed with the alteration of Br/Cl ratios in perovskites (Fig. 5a, Tables S2y andS3y).With CsPbBr 3 as a catalyst, the yield of CO and CH 4 is 135 and 60 lmol/g, respectively.After displacing Br with Cl at x 0.7, the yield of CO and CH 4 enhances slightly up to 156 and 72 lmol/g.When using CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 as a catalyst, the CO generation undergoes a sharp increase to 767 lmol/g which is 5.7-fold and 4.9-fold higher than that of pure CsPbBr 3 and CsPb(Br 0.7 /Cl 0.3 ) 3 , while CH 4 only exhibits a slight enhancement (108 lmol/g) (Fig. S5ay).However, further enhancing the Cl content (x 0.3 or 0), the production amount of CO and CH 4 in CsPb(Br 0.3 /Cl 0.7 ) 3 or CsPbCl 3 presents an obvious decrease.From these results, we can find Cl introduction has a significant influence on the activity of CO 2 reduction in this photocatalytic system.The optimal catalyst is CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 with a total catalytic yield of CO and CH 4 up to 875 lmol/g which is around 4.5 and 9.1 times higher than the performance of CsPbBr 3 and CsPbCl 3 materials.What's more, the common byproduct H 2 is avoided in all of CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 catalyst and the selectivity toward CO and CH 4 is up to 99. CsPbBr 3 QDs with the orthorhombic phase are first reported as a photocatalyst for CO 2 photoreduction 42.To get an unambiguous evaluation about mixed-halide strategy in CO 2 photoreduction, the orthorhombic CsPbBr 3 sample was employed as a catalyst in our experimental condition (Fig. S5by).After 9 h reaction, around 112 lmol/g CO and 33 lmol/g CH 4 are produced and the total generation amount (145 lmol/g) is 1/6 of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 and comparable with that of cubic CsPbBr 3 (195 lmol/g).Compared with the mixed-halide strategy, crystal phase (orthorhombic or cubic) has a little effect on the CO 2 photoreduction performance.Moreover, the total yield of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 perovskite toward CO 2 reduction is much better than that of reported popular catalysts, such as TiO 2 , CdS and g-C 3 N 4 under similar condition (Table S4y).To better confirm the advantage of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 perovskite over these materials in CO 2 reduction, the activity of g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets and TiO 2 (P25) were studied under the same catalytic condition (Table S5y).The photocatalytic results demonstrate that the reactivity of g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets and TiO 2 (P25) is around 10-fold and 5-fold lower than that of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 respectively. The CO 2 photoreduction activity of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 materials within different time was investigated by detecting the amounts of CO and CH 4 every three hours (Fig. 5b).Within the period, the outputs of CO and CH 4 are 250 20 and 25.0 2 lmol/g, respectively.These results present that CO and CH 4 almost linearly increase during the 9 h irradiation.These results imply that CsPb (Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 materials might have a moderate stability during photocatalysis.To compare the performance of different catalysts via tuning ratios of Br/Cl during different reaction time, the experiments were carried out (Fig. S6y).The higher generation speed of CO than that of CH 4 may result from the needed multi-electrons pathway in CH 4 formation.The decrease of CH 4 amount after 9 h reaction may ascribe to the discontinuous irradiation which severely affects electrons accumulation to feed 8 electrons route. The control experiment was investigated to determine the source of the gas product under an inert Ar gas atmosphere.After 9 h irradiation, CO and CO 2 were generated with the amount of 94 and 430 lmol/g by CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 , respectively.The CO yield under Ar is around one-in-eight of that under saturated CO 2 (767 lmol/g) which means that a small quantity of CO generated from the photosynthesis system due to partial photooxidation of ethyl acetate.To further make sure the carbon source of the reaction product, gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC-MS) was used to detect CO under 13 CO 2 atmosphere using CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 as catalysts (Fig. 6).The result of isotopic experiment indicates that about 85 of CO comes from 13 CO 2 photoreduction.

Besides activity, the stability of a catalyst is another significant factor affecting the catalytic efficiency.To illuminate the stability of mixed-halide perovskite materials, we studied the crystalline phase after photocatalysis.No obvious changes in PXRD patterns of CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 0.7, 0.5, 0.3) are observed after photocatalysis.Contrast to mixed-halide perovskite, the PXRD pattern of CsPbCl 3 after catalysis was kept intact but the one of CsPbBr 3 (Fig. 7a) shows a few new peaks (CsPb 2 Br 5 ).These results imply mixed-halide perovskite materials may have better stability than that of bare CsPbBr 3 , and indicate that the introduction of Cl in halide perovskite could be a promising way to enhance the stability of perovskite in CO 2 photoreduction to some extent. Considering the PXRD results, the reusable experiment was conducted (Fig. S7y).After second recycle (corresponding to 18 h reaction), around 42 and 56 decrease in CO and CH 4 generation with CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 as catalyst was observed, however, after third recycle (corresponding to 27 h reaction), the yield of both CO and CH 4 sharply reduced to 38 and 23.The decrease of catalytic activity may result from the moderate durability of perovskite materials under the long-time irradiation.For other CsPb (Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 0, 0.3, 0.7, 1), with the Cl content enhanced, the reduced degree in reactivity decreased.According to these experiments, the ratio of Br and Cl at 0.5:0.5 should be the most active rather than the most stable.The advantage in band energy and the moderate stability of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 may make it be the most appropriate catalyst for CO 2 photoreduction.Fig. 6.The GC-MS result of an isotopic experiment with 13 CO 2 as carbon sources using CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 as the catalyst.Given that charge separation plays a crucial role in the redox reaction, transient photocurrent responses were employed to reveal the rooted reason behind the predominant photocatalytic performance of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 materials in CO 2 reduction.First, the photoelectrodes were prepared and the thickness of the film cross-section was determined by SEM image of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 photoelectrode (Fig. S8y).The photocurrent responses were collected under Xe-300 lamp with AM 1.5 filter under dark and light conditions.In Fig. 7b, the photocurrent density of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 elevates rapidly up to 4.4 lA/cm 2 during light irradiation and then decreases sharply under the dark condition, which can be successively implemented for multiple times.Other mixed-halide perovskites CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 0.7, 0.3) have similar phenomena during on-off irradiation but with low photocurrent density.These results illuminate the charge separation of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 is more efficient than the other two mixed-halide perovskites.Together with the band energy and the advantage in moderate stability, CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 may be the most appropriate catalyst for CO 2 photoreduction."}, {"llm generation": "CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3", "source": "What's more, the common byproduct H 2 is avoided in all of CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 catalyst and the selectivity toward CO and CH 4 is up to 99.", "context": "The monodispersed mixed-halide perovskites CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 0.7, 0.5, 0.3) were synthesized according to the welldeveloped hot injection method 47.As control in catalytic experiment, CsPbBr 3 and CsPbCl 3 nanocrystals were also prepared through the same approach.Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns show a pure cubic phase of the as-prepared CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0) nanocrystals (Fig. 2e), which is consistent with the previous reports 47,48.Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images presented in Fig. 2a and Fig. S1y exhibit that all CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0) crystals are cubic shape with a size around 10.5 nm (Fig. 2c).Such small particle size will provide guarantee of a large specific surface area for catalysis.Depending on the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (Fig. 2b), the lattice parameter of the CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 materials is 0.57 nm suggesting the as-prepared materials are highly crystalline in perovskite structure.Moreover, the energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectra reveal the existence of Cs, Pb, Br and Cl elements in CsPb (Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 materials (Fig. 2d). We examined the surface chemical binding of CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0) materials with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Fig. S2y).The peaks of Cs 3d of CsPbBr 3 (x 1) at 724.0 and 738.1 eV are gradually red-shift to 723.8 and 737.8 eV (CsPbCl 3 , x 0), respectively (Fig. 3a).For the peaks of Pb 4f, they individually exhibit blue-shift from 137.8 and 142.7 eV of CsPbBr 3 to 138.0 and 142.9 eV of CsPbCl 3 (Fig. 3b).These indicate that bonding environment of Cs and Pb atoms is changed via tuning the ratios of Br/Cl.The peaks of Br 3d and/or Cl 2p in CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0) are almost unchanged (Fig. 3c,d).To better understand the actual ratio of Br/Cl in the synthesized perovskites, the elemental analysis is carried out by ICP-MS (Table S1y), which indicates that the actual ratio is generally consistent with the molar feed ratio. In the following experiments, we studied the optical properties of CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 materials.Firstly, using ethyl acetate as a solvent, light absorption property of CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 was measured.CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 exhibit a good absorption toward the visible light, ranging from 400 to 700 nm (Fig. 4a), which is quite wider than the typical semiconductors, such as TiO 2 , ZnO 6,49,50.With x value increases, the absorption peaking at 520 nm (CsPbBr 3 ) gradually shifts to 420 nm (CsPbCl 3 ).For semiconductor, the band edge positions have a significant influence on the catalytic reactivity.Hence, the band edge positions of CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0) materials were studied.First, the band gap (E g ) of them was decided by UV-vis diffuse reflection spectroscopy (DRS, Fig. S3y) based on Tauc method 51.Fig. 4b shows the (ahm) 2 versus hm curves of CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0) materials with a direct band gap 52.The E g values of CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0) were from 2.33 to 2.98 eV (Table 1) based on the Xaxis intercept of the Tauc plot.The valence band (E VB ) of CsPb (Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0) materials are determined by Valence-band XPS (VB XPS, Fig. 4c and Fig. S4y).The conduction band (E CB ) are determined by the equation 53: According to the band edge positions in Table 1, we can find that E VB enhanced with the increase of Cl content in CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 , while very little change of E CB was observed.Thus, the E VB depends more strongly on the halide composition than E CB .In addition, E CB levels of all as-prepared halide perovskites are higher than the reductive potential of CO 2 to CO (A0.5 eV).Under the excitation of 362 nm (except CsPbCl 3 which was excited by 320 nm), emission spectra of CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0) materials were collected.The emission band peaking at 517 nm is observed on CsPbBr 3 and with the enhancement of Cl content, the peak is gradually shifted to 413 nm (Fig. 4d).To investigate the catalytic activity of mixed-halide perovskite toward CO 2 reduction, the catalytic experiment was carried out following the reaction condition reported by Su and co-workers in which only perovskites and ethyl acetate were used in the system 42.As a control experiment, the catalytic activity of CsPbBr 3 and CsPbCl 3 was also investigated.Firstly, a certain amount of halide perovskites was put into a quartz tube containing 6 mL ethyl acetate.After irradiation by Xe-300 lamp with AM 1.5 filter within 9 h, CO and CH 4 are generated as the main gas product and the yield is changed with the alteration of Br/Cl ratios in perovskites (Fig. 5a, Tables S2y andS3y).With CsPbBr 3 as a catalyst, the yield of CO and CH 4 is 135 and 60 lmol/g, respectively.After displacing Br with Cl at x 0.7, the yield of CO and CH 4 enhances slightly up to 156 and 72 lmol/g.When using CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 as a catalyst, the CO generation undergoes a sharp increase to 767 lmol/g which is 5.7-fold and 4.9-fold higher than that of pure CsPbBr 3 and CsPb(Br 0.7 /Cl 0.3 ) 3 , while CH 4 only exhibits a slight enhancement (108 lmol/g) (Fig. S5ay).However, further enhancing the Cl content (x 0.3 or 0), the production amount of CO and CH 4 in CsPb(Br 0.3 /Cl 0.7 ) 3 or CsPbCl 3 presents an obvious decrease.From these results, we can find Cl introduction has a significant influence on the activity of CO 2 reduction in this photocatalytic system.The optimal catalyst is CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 with a total catalytic yield of CO and CH 4 up to 875 lmol/g which is around 4.5 and 9.1 times higher than the performance of CsPbBr 3 and CsPbCl 3 materials.What's more, the common byproduct H 2 is avoided in all of CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 catalyst and the selectivity toward CO and CH 4 is up to 99. CsPbBr 3 QDs with the orthorhombic phase are first reported as a photocatalyst for CO 2 photoreduction 42.To get an unambiguous evaluation about mixed-halide strategy in CO 2 photoreduction, the orthorhombic CsPbBr 3 sample was employed as a catalyst in our experimental condition (Fig. S5by).After 9 h reaction, around 112 lmol/g CO and 33 lmol/g CH 4 are produced and the total generation amount (145 lmol/g) is 1/6 of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 and comparable with that of cubic CsPbBr 3 (195 lmol/g).Compared with the mixed-halide strategy, crystal phase (orthorhombic or cubic) has a little effect on the CO 2 photoreduction performance.Moreover, the total yield of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 perovskite toward CO 2 reduction is much better than that of reported popular catalysts, such as TiO 2 , CdS and g-C 3 N 4 under similar condition (Table S4y).To better confirm the advantage of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 perovskite over these materials in CO 2 reduction, the activity of g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets and TiO 2 (P25) were studied under the same catalytic condition (Table S5y).The photocatalytic results demonstrate that the reactivity of g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets and TiO 2 (P25) is around 10-fold and 5-fold lower than that of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 respectively. The CO 2 photoreduction activity of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 materials within different time was investigated by detecting the amounts of CO and CH 4 every three hours (Fig. 5b).Within the period, the outputs of CO and CH 4 are 250 20 and 25.0 2 lmol/g, respectively.These results present that CO and CH 4 almost linearly increase during the 9 h irradiation.These results imply that CsPb (Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 materials might have a moderate stability during photocatalysis.To compare the performance of different catalysts via tuning ratios of Br/Cl during different reaction time, the experiments were carried out (Fig. S6y).The higher generation speed of CO than that of CH 4 may result from the needed multi-electrons pathway in CH 4 formation.The decrease of CH 4 amount after 9 h reaction may ascribe to the discontinuous irradiation which severely affects electrons accumulation to feed 8 electrons route. The control experiment was investigated to determine the source of the gas product under an inert Ar gas atmosphere.After 9 h irradiation, CO and CO 2 were generated with the amount of 94 and 430 lmol/g by CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 , respectively.The CO yield under Ar is around one-in-eight of that under saturated CO 2 (767 lmol/g) which means that a small quantity of CO generated from the photosynthesis system due to partial photooxidation of ethyl acetate.To further make sure the carbon source of the reaction product, gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC-MS) was used to detect CO under 13 CO 2 atmosphere using CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 as catalysts (Fig. 6).The result of isotopic experiment indicates that about 85 of CO comes from 13 CO 2 photoreduction.

Besides activity, the stability of a catalyst is another significant factor affecting the catalytic efficiency.To illuminate the stability of mixed-halide perovskite materials, we studied the crystalline phase after photocatalysis.No obvious changes in PXRD patterns of CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 0.7, 0.5, 0.3) are observed after photocatalysis.Contrast to mixed-halide perovskite, the PXRD pattern of CsPbCl 3 after catalysis was kept intact but the one of CsPbBr 3 (Fig. 7a) shows a few new peaks (CsPb 2 Br 5 ).These results imply mixed-halide perovskite materials may have better stability than that of bare CsPbBr 3 , and indicate that the introduction of Cl in halide perovskite could be a promising way to enhance the stability of perovskite in CO 2 photoreduction to some extent. Considering the PXRD results, the reusable experiment was conducted (Fig. S7y).After second recycle (corresponding to 18 h reaction), around 42 and 56 decrease in CO and CH 4 generation with CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 as catalyst was observed, however, after third recycle (corresponding to 27 h reaction), the yield of both CO and CH 4 sharply reduced to 38 and 23.The decrease of catalytic activity may result from the moderate durability of perovskite materials under the long-time irradiation.For other CsPb (Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 0, 0.3, 0.7, 1), with the Cl content enhanced, the reduced degree in reactivity decreased.According to these experiments, the ratio of Br and Cl at 0.5:0.5 should be the most active rather than the most stable.The advantage in band energy and the moderate stability of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 may make it be the most appropriate catalyst for CO 2 photoreduction.Fig. 6.The GC-MS result of an isotopic experiment with 13 CO 2 as carbon sources using CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 as the catalyst.Given that charge separation plays a crucial role in the redox reaction, transient photocurrent responses were employed to reveal the rooted reason behind the predominant photocatalytic performance of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 materials in CO 2 reduction.First, the photoelectrodes were prepared and the thickness of the film cross-section was determined by SEM image of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 photoelectrode (Fig. S8y).The photocurrent responses were collected under Xe-300 lamp with AM 1.5 filter under dark and light conditions.In Fig. 7b, the photocurrent density of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 elevates rapidly up to 4.4 lA/cm 2 during light irradiation and then decreases sharply under the dark condition, which can be successively implemented for multiple times.Other mixed-halide perovskites CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 0.7, 0.3) have similar phenomena during on-off irradiation but with low photocurrent density.These results illuminate the charge separation of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 is more efficient than the other two mixed-halide perovskites.Together with the band energy and the advantage in moderate stability, CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 may be the most appropriate catalyst for CO 2 photoreduction."}, {"llm generation": "TiO2 (P25)", "source": "To better confirm the advantage of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 perovskite over these materials in CO 2 reduction, the activity of g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets and TiO 2 (P25) were studied under the same catalytic condition (Table S5y).", "context": "The monodispersed mixed-halide perovskites CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 0.7, 0.5, 0.3) were synthesized according to the welldeveloped hot injection method 47.As control in catalytic experiment, CsPbBr 3 and CsPbCl 3 nanocrystals were also prepared through the same approach.Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns show a pure cubic phase of the as-prepared CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0) nanocrystals (Fig. 2e), which is consistent with the previous reports 47,48.Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images presented in Fig. 2a and Fig. S1y exhibit that all CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0) crystals are cubic shape with a size around 10.5 nm (Fig. 2c).Such small particle size will provide guarantee of a large specific surface area for catalysis.Depending on the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (Fig. 2b), the lattice parameter of the CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 materials is 0.57 nm suggesting the as-prepared materials are highly crystalline in perovskite structure.Moreover, the energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectra reveal the existence of Cs, Pb, Br and Cl elements in CsPb (Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 materials (Fig. 2d). We examined the surface chemical binding of CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0) materials with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Fig. S2y).The peaks of Cs 3d of CsPbBr 3 (x 1) at 724.0 and 738.1 eV are gradually red-shift to 723.8 and 737.8 eV (CsPbCl 3 , x 0), respectively (Fig. 3a).For the peaks of Pb 4f, they individually exhibit blue-shift from 137.8 and 142.7 eV of CsPbBr 3 to 138.0 and 142.9 eV of CsPbCl 3 (Fig. 3b).These indicate that bonding environment of Cs and Pb atoms is changed via tuning the ratios of Br/Cl.The peaks of Br 3d and/or Cl 2p in CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0) are almost unchanged (Fig. 3c,d).To better understand the actual ratio of Br/Cl in the synthesized perovskites, the elemental analysis is carried out by ICP-MS (Table S1y), which indicates that the actual ratio is generally consistent with the molar feed ratio. In the following experiments, we studied the optical properties of CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 materials.Firstly, using ethyl acetate as a solvent, light absorption property of CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 was measured.CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 exhibit a good absorption toward the visible light, ranging from 400 to 700 nm (Fig. 4a), which is quite wider than the typical semiconductors, such as TiO 2 , ZnO 6,49,50.With x value increases, the absorption peaking at 520 nm (CsPbBr 3 ) gradually shifts to 420 nm (CsPbCl 3 ).For semiconductor, the band edge positions have a significant influence on the catalytic reactivity.Hence, the band edge positions of CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0) materials were studied.First, the band gap (E g ) of them was decided by UV-vis diffuse reflection spectroscopy (DRS, Fig. S3y) based on Tauc method 51.Fig. 4b shows the (ahm) 2 versus hm curves of CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0) materials with a direct band gap 52.The E g values of CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0) were from 2.33 to 2.98 eV (Table 1) based on the Xaxis intercept of the Tauc plot.The valence band (E VB ) of CsPb (Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0) materials are determined by Valence-band XPS (VB XPS, Fig. 4c and Fig. S4y).The conduction band (E CB ) are determined by the equation 53: According to the band edge positions in Table 1, we can find that E VB enhanced with the increase of Cl content in CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 , while very little change of E CB was observed.Thus, the E VB depends more strongly on the halide composition than E CB .In addition, E CB levels of all as-prepared halide perovskites are higher than the reductive potential of CO 2 to CO (A0.5 eV).Under the excitation of 362 nm (except CsPbCl 3 which was excited by 320 nm), emission spectra of CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0) materials were collected.The emission band peaking at 517 nm is observed on CsPbBr 3 and with the enhancement of Cl content, the peak is gradually shifted to 413 nm (Fig. 4d).To investigate the catalytic activity of mixed-halide perovskite toward CO 2 reduction, the catalytic experiment was carried out following the reaction condition reported by Su and co-workers in which only perovskites and ethyl acetate were used in the system 42.As a control experiment, the catalytic activity of CsPbBr 3 and CsPbCl 3 was also investigated.Firstly, a certain amount of halide perovskites was put into a quartz tube containing 6 mL ethyl acetate.After irradiation by Xe-300 lamp with AM 1.5 filter within 9 h, CO and CH 4 are generated as the main gas product and the yield is changed with the alteration of Br/Cl ratios in perovskites (Fig. 5a, Tables S2y andS3y).With CsPbBr 3 as a catalyst, the yield of CO and CH 4 is 135 and 60 lmol/g, respectively.After displacing Br with Cl at x 0.7, the yield of CO and CH 4 enhances slightly up to 156 and 72 lmol/g.When using CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 as a catalyst, the CO generation undergoes a sharp increase to 767 lmol/g which is 5.7-fold and 4.9-fold higher than that of pure CsPbBr 3 and CsPb(Br 0.7 /Cl 0.3 ) 3 , while CH 4 only exhibits a slight enhancement (108 lmol/g) (Fig. S5ay).However, further enhancing the Cl content (x 0.3 or 0), the production amount of CO and CH 4 in CsPb(Br 0.3 /Cl 0.7 ) 3 or CsPbCl 3 presents an obvious decrease.From these results, we can find Cl introduction has a significant influence on the activity of CO 2 reduction in this photocatalytic system.The optimal catalyst is CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 with a total catalytic yield of CO and CH 4 up to 875 lmol/g which is around 4.5 and 9.1 times higher than the performance of CsPbBr 3 and CsPbCl 3 materials.What's more, the common byproduct H 2 is avoided in all of CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 catalyst and the selectivity toward CO and CH 4 is up to 99. CsPbBr 3 QDs with the orthorhombic phase are first reported as a photocatalyst for CO 2 photoreduction 42.To get an unambiguous evaluation about mixed-halide strategy in CO 2 photoreduction, the orthorhombic CsPbBr 3 sample was employed as a catalyst in our experimental condition (Fig. S5by).After 9 h reaction, around 112 lmol/g CO and 33 lmol/g CH 4 are produced and the total generation amount (145 lmol/g) is 1/6 of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 and comparable with that of cubic CsPbBr 3 (195 lmol/g).Compared with the mixed-halide strategy, crystal phase (orthorhombic or cubic) has a little effect on the CO 2 photoreduction performance.Moreover, the total yield of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 perovskite toward CO 2 reduction is much better than that of reported popular catalysts, such as TiO 2 , CdS and g-C 3 N 4 under similar condition (Table S4y).To better confirm the advantage of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 perovskite over these materials in CO 2 reduction, the activity of g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets and TiO 2 (P25) were studied under the same catalytic condition (Table S5y).The photocatalytic results demonstrate that the reactivity of g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets and TiO 2 (P25) is around 10-fold and 5-fold lower than that of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 respectively. The CO 2 photoreduction activity of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 materials within different time was investigated by detecting the amounts of CO and CH 4 every three hours (Fig. 5b).Within the period, the outputs of CO and CH 4 are 250 20 and 25.0 2 lmol/g, respectively.These results present that CO and CH 4 almost linearly increase during the 9 h irradiation.These results imply that CsPb (Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 materials might have a moderate stability during photocatalysis.To compare the performance of different catalysts via tuning ratios of Br/Cl during different reaction time, the experiments were carried out (Fig. S6y).The higher generation speed of CO than that of CH 4 may result from the needed multi-electrons pathway in CH 4 formation.The decrease of CH 4 amount after 9 h reaction may ascribe to the discontinuous irradiation which severely affects electrons accumulation to feed 8 electrons route. The control experiment was investigated to determine the source of the gas product under an inert Ar gas atmosphere.After 9 h irradiation, CO and CO 2 were generated with the amount of 94 and 430 lmol/g by CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 , respectively.The CO yield under Ar is around one-in-eight of that under saturated CO 2 (767 lmol/g) which means that a small quantity of CO generated from the photosynthesis system due to partial photooxidation of ethyl acetate.To further make sure the carbon source of the reaction product, gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC-MS) was used to detect CO under 13 CO 2 atmosphere using CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 as catalysts (Fig. 6).The result of isotopic experiment indicates that about 85 of CO comes from 13 CO 2 photoreduction.

Besides activity, the stability of a catalyst is another significant factor affecting the catalytic efficiency.To illuminate the stability of mixed-halide perovskite materials, we studied the crystalline phase after photocatalysis.No obvious changes in PXRD patterns of CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 0.7, 0.5, 0.3) are observed after photocatalysis.Contrast to mixed-halide perovskite, the PXRD pattern of CsPbCl 3 after catalysis was kept intact but the one of CsPbBr 3 (Fig. 7a) shows a few new peaks (CsPb 2 Br 5 ).These results imply mixed-halide perovskite materials may have better stability than that of bare CsPbBr 3 , and indicate that the introduction of Cl in halide perovskite could be a promising way to enhance the stability of perovskite in CO 2 photoreduction to some extent. Considering the PXRD results, the reusable experiment was conducted (Fig. S7y).After second recycle (corresponding to 18 h reaction), around 42 and 56 decrease in CO and CH 4 generation with CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 as catalyst was observed, however, after third recycle (corresponding to 27 h reaction), the yield of both CO and CH 4 sharply reduced to 38 and 23.The decrease of catalytic activity may result from the moderate durability of perovskite materials under the long-time irradiation.For other CsPb (Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 0, 0.3, 0.7, 1), with the Cl content enhanced, the reduced degree in reactivity decreased.According to these experiments, the ratio of Br and Cl at 0.5:0.5 should be the most active rather than the most stable.The advantage in band energy and the moderate stability of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 may make it be the most appropriate catalyst for CO 2 photoreduction.Fig. 6.The GC-MS result of an isotopic experiment with 13 CO 2 as carbon sources using CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 as the catalyst.Given that charge separation plays a crucial role in the redox reaction, transient photocurrent responses were employed to reveal the rooted reason behind the predominant photocatalytic performance of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 materials in CO 2 reduction.First, the photoelectrodes were prepared and the thickness of the film cross-section was determined by SEM image of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 photoelectrode (Fig. S8y).The photocurrent responses were collected under Xe-300 lamp with AM 1.5 filter under dark and light conditions.In Fig. 7b, the photocurrent density of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 elevates rapidly up to 4.4 lA/cm 2 during light irradiation and then decreases sharply under the dark condition, which can be successively implemented for multiple times.Other mixed-halide perovskites CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 0.7, 0.3) have similar phenomena during on-off irradiation but with low photocurrent density.These results illuminate the charge separation of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 is more efficient than the other two mixed-halide perovskites.Together with the band energy and the advantage in moderate stability, CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 may be the most appropriate catalyst for CO 2 photoreduction."}, {"llm generation": "CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3", "source": "After second recycle (corresponding to 18 h reaction), around 42 and 56 decrease in CO and CH 4 generation with CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 as catalyst was observed, however, after third recycle (corresponding to 27 h reaction), the yield of both CO and CH 4 sharply reduced to 38 and 23.", "context": "The monodispersed mixed-halide perovskites CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 0.7, 0.5, 0.3) were synthesized according to the welldeveloped hot injection method 47.As control in catalytic experiment, CsPbBr 3 and CsPbCl 3 nanocrystals were also prepared through the same approach.Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns show a pure cubic phase of the as-prepared CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0) nanocrystals (Fig. 2e), which is consistent with the previous reports 47,48.Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images presented in Fig. 2a and Fig. S1y exhibit that all CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0) crystals are cubic shape with a size around 10.5 nm (Fig. 2c).Such small particle size will provide guarantee of a large specific surface area for catalysis.Depending on the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (Fig. 2b), the lattice parameter of the CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 materials is 0.57 nm suggesting the as-prepared materials are highly crystalline in perovskite structure.Moreover, the energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectra reveal the existence of Cs, Pb, Br and Cl elements in CsPb (Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 materials (Fig. 2d). We examined the surface chemical binding of CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0) materials with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Fig. S2y).The peaks of Cs 3d of CsPbBr 3 (x 1) at 724.0 and 738.1 eV are gradually red-shift to 723.8 and 737.8 eV (CsPbCl 3 , x 0), respectively (Fig. 3a).For the peaks of Pb 4f, they individually exhibit blue-shift from 137.8 and 142.7 eV of CsPbBr 3 to 138.0 and 142.9 eV of CsPbCl 3 (Fig. 3b).These indicate that bonding environment of Cs and Pb atoms is changed via tuning the ratios of Br/Cl.The peaks of Br 3d and/or Cl 2p in CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0) are almost unchanged (Fig. 3c,d).To better understand the actual ratio of Br/Cl in the synthesized perovskites, the elemental analysis is carried out by ICP-MS (Table S1y), which indicates that the actual ratio is generally consistent with the molar feed ratio. In the following experiments, we studied the optical properties of CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 materials.Firstly, using ethyl acetate as a solvent, light absorption property of CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 was measured.CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 exhibit a good absorption toward the visible light, ranging from 400 to 700 nm (Fig. 4a), which is quite wider than the typical semiconductors, such as TiO 2 , ZnO 6,49,50.With x value increases, the absorption peaking at 520 nm (CsPbBr 3 ) gradually shifts to 420 nm (CsPbCl 3 ).For semiconductor, the band edge positions have a significant influence on the catalytic reactivity.Hence, the band edge positions of CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0) materials were studied.First, the band gap (E g ) of them was decided by UV-vis diffuse reflection spectroscopy (DRS, Fig. S3y) based on Tauc method 51.Fig. 4b shows the (ahm) 2 versus hm curves of CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0) materials with a direct band gap 52.The E g values of CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0) were from 2.33 to 2.98 eV (Table 1) based on the Xaxis intercept of the Tauc plot.The valence band (E VB ) of CsPb (Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0) materials are determined by Valence-band XPS (VB XPS, Fig. 4c and Fig. S4y).The conduction band (E CB ) are determined by the equation 53: According to the band edge positions in Table 1, we can find that E VB enhanced with the increase of Cl content in CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 , while very little change of E CB was observed.Thus, the E VB depends more strongly on the halide composition than E CB .In addition, E CB levels of all as-prepared halide perovskites are higher than the reductive potential of CO 2 to CO (A0.5 eV).Under the excitation of 362 nm (except CsPbCl 3 which was excited by 320 nm), emission spectra of CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0) materials were collected.The emission band peaking at 517 nm is observed on CsPbBr 3 and with the enhancement of Cl content, the peak is gradually shifted to 413 nm (Fig. 4d).To investigate the catalytic activity of mixed-halide perovskite toward CO 2 reduction, the catalytic experiment was carried out following the reaction condition reported by Su and co-workers in which only perovskites and ethyl acetate were used in the system 42.As a control experiment, the catalytic activity of CsPbBr 3 and CsPbCl 3 was also investigated.Firstly, a certain amount of halide perovskites was put into a quartz tube containing 6 mL ethyl acetate.After irradiation by Xe-300 lamp with AM 1.5 filter within 9 h, CO and CH 4 are generated as the main gas product and the yield is changed with the alteration of Br/Cl ratios in perovskites (Fig. 5a, Tables S2y andS3y).With CsPbBr 3 as a catalyst, the yield of CO and CH 4 is 135 and 60 lmol/g, respectively.After displacing Br with Cl at x 0.7, the yield of CO and CH 4 enhances slightly up to 156 and 72 lmol/g.When using CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 as a catalyst, the CO generation undergoes a sharp increase to 767 lmol/g which is 5.7-fold and 4.9-fold higher than that of pure CsPbBr 3 and CsPb(Br 0.7 /Cl 0.3 ) 3 , while CH 4 only exhibits a slight enhancement (108 lmol/g) (Fig. S5ay).However, further enhancing the Cl content (x 0.3 or 0), the production amount of CO and CH 4 in CsPb(Br 0.3 /Cl 0.7 ) 3 or CsPbCl 3 presents an obvious decrease.From these results, we can find Cl introduction has a significant influence on the activity of CO 2 reduction in this photocatalytic system.The optimal catalyst is CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 with a total catalytic yield of CO and CH 4 up to 875 lmol/g which is around 4.5 and 9.1 times higher than the performance of CsPbBr 3 and CsPbCl 3 materials.What's more, the common byproduct H 2 is avoided in all of CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 catalyst and the selectivity toward CO and CH 4 is up to 99. CsPbBr 3 QDs with the orthorhombic phase are first reported as a photocatalyst for CO 2 photoreduction 42.To get an unambiguous evaluation about mixed-halide strategy in CO 2 photoreduction, the orthorhombic CsPbBr 3 sample was employed as a catalyst in our experimental condition (Fig. S5by).After 9 h reaction, around 112 lmol/g CO and 33 lmol/g CH 4 are produced and the total generation amount (145 lmol/g) is 1/6 of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 and comparable with that of cubic CsPbBr 3 (195 lmol/g).Compared with the mixed-halide strategy, crystal phase (orthorhombic or cubic) has a little effect on the CO 2 photoreduction performance.Moreover, the total yield of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 perovskite toward CO 2 reduction is much better than that of reported popular catalysts, such as TiO 2 , CdS and g-C 3 N 4 under similar condition (Table S4y).To better confirm the advantage of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 perovskite over these materials in CO 2 reduction, the activity of g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets and TiO 2 (P25) were studied under the same catalytic condition (Table S5y).The photocatalytic results demonstrate that the reactivity of g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets and TiO 2 (P25) is around 10-fold and 5-fold lower than that of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 respectively. The CO 2 photoreduction activity of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 materials within different time was investigated by detecting the amounts of CO and CH 4 every three hours (Fig. 5b).Within the period, the outputs of CO and CH 4 are 250 20 and 25.0 2 lmol/g, respectively.These results present that CO and CH 4 almost linearly increase during the 9 h irradiation.These results imply that CsPb (Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 materials might have a moderate stability during photocatalysis.To compare the performance of different catalysts via tuning ratios of Br/Cl during different reaction time, the experiments were carried out (Fig. S6y).The higher generation speed of CO than that of CH 4 may result from the needed multi-electrons pathway in CH 4 formation.The decrease of CH 4 amount after 9 h reaction may ascribe to the discontinuous irradiation which severely affects electrons accumulation to feed 8 electrons route. The control experiment was investigated to determine the source of the gas product under an inert Ar gas atmosphere.After 9 h irradiation, CO and CO 2 were generated with the amount of 94 and 430 lmol/g by CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 , respectively.The CO yield under Ar is around one-in-eight of that under saturated CO 2 (767 lmol/g) which means that a small quantity of CO generated from the photosynthesis system due to partial photooxidation of ethyl acetate.To further make sure the carbon source of the reaction product, gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC-MS) was used to detect CO under 13 CO 2 atmosphere using CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 as catalysts (Fig. 6).The result of isotopic experiment indicates that about 85 of CO comes from 13 CO 2 photoreduction.

In the following experiments, we studied the optical properties of CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 materials.Firstly, using ethyl acetate as a solvent, light absorption property of CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 was measured.CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 exhibit a good absorption toward the visible light, ranging from 400 to 700 nm (Fig. 4a), which is quite wider than the typical semiconductors, such as TiO 2 , ZnO 6,49,50.With x value increases, the absorption peaking at 520 nm (CsPbBr 3 ) gradually shifts to 420 nm (CsPbCl 3 ).For semiconductor, the band edge positions have a significant influence on the catalytic reactivity.Hence, the band edge positions of CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0) materials were studied.First, the band gap (E g ) of them was decided by UV-vis diffuse reflection spectroscopy (DRS, Fig. S3y) based on Tauc method 51.Fig. 4b shows the (ahm) 2 versus hm curves of CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0) materials with a direct band gap 52.The E g values of CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0) were from 2.33 to 2.98 eV (Table 1) based on the Xaxis intercept of the Tauc plot.The valence band (E VB ) of CsPb (Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0) materials are determined by Valence-band XPS (VB XPS, Fig. 4c and Fig. S4y).The conduction band (E CB ) are determined by the equation 53: According to the band edge positions in Table 1, we can find that E VB enhanced with the increase of Cl content in CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 , while very little change of E CB was observed.Thus, the E VB depends more strongly on the halide composition than E CB .In addition, E CB levels of all as-prepared halide perovskites are higher than the reductive potential of CO 2 to CO (A0.5 eV).Under the excitation of 362 nm (except CsPbCl 3 which was excited by 320 nm), emission spectra of CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0) materials were collected.The emission band peaking at 517 nm is observed on CsPbBr 3 and with the enhancement of Cl content, the peak is gradually shifted to 413 nm (Fig. 4d).To investigate the catalytic activity of mixed-halide perovskite toward CO 2 reduction, the catalytic experiment was carried out following the reaction condition reported by Su and co-workers in which only perovskites and ethyl acetate were used in the system 42.As a control experiment, the catalytic activity of CsPbBr 3 and CsPbCl 3 was also investigated.Firstly, a certain amount of halide perovskites was put into a quartz tube containing 6 mL ethyl acetate.After irradiation by Xe-300 lamp with AM 1.5 filter within 9 h, CO and CH 4 are generated as the main gas product and the yield is changed with the alteration of Br/Cl ratios in perovskites (Fig. 5a, Tables S2y andS3y).With CsPbBr 3 as a catalyst, the yield of CO and CH 4 is 135 and 60 lmol/g, respectively.After displacing Br with Cl at x 0.7, the yield of CO and CH 4 enhances slightly up to 156 and 72 lmol/g.When using CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 as a catalyst, the CO generation undergoes a sharp increase to 767 lmol/g which is 5.7-fold and 4.9-fold higher than that of pure CsPbBr 3 and CsPb(Br 0.7 /Cl 0.3 ) 3 , while CH 4 only exhibits a slight enhancement (108 lmol/g) (Fig. S5ay).However, further enhancing the Cl content (x 0.3 or 0), the production amount of CO and CH 4 in CsPb(Br 0.3 /Cl 0.7 ) 3 or CsPbCl 3 presents an obvious decrease.From these results, we can find Cl introduction has a significant influence on the activity of CO 2 reduction in this photocatalytic system.The optimal catalyst is CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 with a total catalytic yield of CO and CH 4 up to 875 lmol/g which is around 4.5 and 9.1 times higher than the performance of CsPbBr 3 and CsPbCl 3 materials.What's more, the common byproduct H 2 is avoided in all of CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 catalyst and the selectivity toward CO and CH 4 is up to 99. CsPbBr 3 QDs with the orthorhombic phase are first reported as a photocatalyst for CO 2 photoreduction 42.To get an unambiguous evaluation about mixed-halide strategy in CO 2 photoreduction, the orthorhombic CsPbBr 3 sample was employed as a catalyst in our experimental condition (Fig. S5by).After 9 h reaction, around 112 lmol/g CO and 33 lmol/g CH 4 are produced and the total generation amount (145 lmol/g) is 1/6 of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 and comparable with that of cubic CsPbBr 3 (195 lmol/g).Compared with the mixed-halide strategy, crystal phase (orthorhombic or cubic) has a little effect on the CO 2 photoreduction performance.Moreover, the total yield of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 perovskite toward CO 2 reduction is much better than that of reported popular catalysts, such as TiO 2 , CdS and g-C 3 N 4 under similar condition (Table S4y).To better confirm the advantage of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 perovskite over these materials in CO 2 reduction, the activity of g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets and TiO 2 (P25) were studied under the same catalytic condition (Table S5y).The photocatalytic results demonstrate that the reactivity of g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets and TiO 2 (P25) is around 10-fold and 5-fold lower than that of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 respectively. The CO 2 photoreduction activity of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 materials within different time was investigated by detecting the amounts of CO and CH 4 every three hours (Fig. 5b).Within the period, the outputs of CO and CH 4 are 250 20 and 25.0 2 lmol/g, respectively.These results present that CO and CH 4 almost linearly increase during the 9 h irradiation.These results imply that CsPb (Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 materials might have a moderate stability during photocatalysis.To compare the performance of different catalysts via tuning ratios of Br/Cl during different reaction time, the experiments were carried out (Fig. S6y).The higher generation speed of CO than that of CH 4 may result from the needed multi-electrons pathway in CH 4 formation.The decrease of CH 4 amount after 9 h reaction may ascribe to the discontinuous irradiation which severely affects electrons accumulation to feed 8 electrons route. The control experiment was investigated to determine the source of the gas product under an inert Ar gas atmosphere.After 9 h irradiation, CO and CO 2 were generated with the amount of 94 and 430 lmol/g by CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 , respectively.The CO yield under Ar is around one-in-eight of that under saturated CO 2 (767 lmol/g) which means that a small quantity of CO generated from the photosynthesis system due to partial photooxidation of ethyl acetate.To further make sure the carbon source of the reaction product, gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC-MS) was used to detect CO under 13 CO 2 atmosphere using CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 as catalysts (Fig. 6).The result of isotopic experiment indicates that about 85 of CO comes from 13 CO 2 photoreduction. Besides activity, the stability of a catalyst is another significant factor affecting the catalytic efficiency.To illuminate the stability of mixed-halide perovskite materials, we studied the crystalline phase after photocatalysis.No obvious changes in PXRD patterns of CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 0.7, 0.5, 0.3) are observed after photocatalysis.Contrast to mixed-halide perovskite, the PXRD pattern of CsPbCl 3 after catalysis was kept intact but the one of CsPbBr 3 (Fig. 7a) shows a few new peaks (CsPb 2 Br 5 ).These results imply mixed-halide perovskite materials may have better stability than that of bare CsPbBr 3 , and indicate that the introduction of Cl in halide perovskite could be a promising way to enhance the stability of perovskite in CO 2 photoreduction to some extent. Considering the PXRD results, the reusable experiment was conducted (Fig. S7y).After second recycle (corresponding to 18 h reaction), around 42 and 56 decrease in CO and CH 4 generation with CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 as catalyst was observed, however, after third recycle (corresponding to 27 h reaction), the yield of both CO and CH 4 sharply reduced to 38 and 23.The decrease of catalytic activity may result from the moderate durability of perovskite materials under the long-time irradiation.For other CsPb (Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 0, 0.3, 0.7, 1), with the Cl content enhanced, the reduced degree in reactivity decreased.According to these experiments, the ratio of Br and Cl at 0.5:0.5 should be the most active rather than the most stable.The advantage in band energy and the moderate stability of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 may make it be the most appropriate catalyst for CO 2 photoreduction.Fig. 6.The GC-MS result of an isotopic experiment with 13 CO 2 as carbon sources using CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 as the catalyst.Given that charge separation plays a crucial role in the redox reaction, transient photocurrent responses were employed to reveal the rooted reason behind the predominant photocatalytic performance of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 materials in CO 2 reduction.First, the photoelectrodes were prepared and the thickness of the film cross-section was determined by SEM image of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 photoelectrode (Fig. S8y).The photocurrent responses were collected under Xe-300 lamp with AM 1.5 filter under dark and light conditions.In Fig. 7b, the photocurrent density of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 elevates rapidly up to 4.4 lA/cm 2 during light irradiation and then decreases sharply under the dark condition, which can be successively implemented for multiple times.Other mixed-halide perovskites CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 0.7, 0.3) have similar phenomena during on-off irradiation but with low photocurrent density.These results illuminate the charge separation of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 is more efficient than the other two mixed-halide perovskites.Together with the band energy and the advantage in moderate stability, CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 may be the most appropriate catalyst for CO 2 photoreduction."}, {"llm generation": "UV-vis", "source": "First, the band gap (E g ) of them was decided by UV-vis diffuse reflection spectroscopy (DRS, Fig. S3y) based on Tauc method 51.", "context": "The monodispersed mixed-halide perovskites CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 0.7, 0.5, 0.3) were synthesized according to the welldeveloped hot injection method 47.As control in catalytic experiment, CsPbBr 3 and CsPbCl 3 nanocrystals were also prepared through the same approach.Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns show a pure cubic phase of the as-prepared CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0) nanocrystals (Fig. 2e), which is consistent with the previous reports 47,48.Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images presented in Fig. 2a and Fig. S1y exhibit that all CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0) crystals are cubic shape with a size around 10.5 nm (Fig. 2c).Such small particle size will provide guarantee of a large specific surface area for catalysis.Depending on the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (Fig. 2b), the lattice parameter of the CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 materials is 0.57 nm suggesting the as-prepared materials are highly crystalline in perovskite structure.Moreover, the energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectra reveal the existence of Cs, Pb, Br and Cl elements in CsPb (Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 materials (Fig. 2d). We examined the surface chemical binding of CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0) materials with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Fig. S2y).The peaks of Cs 3d of CsPbBr 3 (x 1) at 724.0 and 738.1 eV are gradually red-shift to 723.8 and 737.8 eV (CsPbCl 3 , x 0), respectively (Fig. 3a).For the peaks of Pb 4f, they individually exhibit blue-shift from 137.8 and 142.7 eV of CsPbBr 3 to 138.0 and 142.9 eV of CsPbCl 3 (Fig. 3b).These indicate that bonding environment of Cs and Pb atoms is changed via tuning the ratios of Br/Cl.The peaks of Br 3d and/or Cl 2p in CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0) are almost unchanged (Fig. 3c,d).To better understand the actual ratio of Br/Cl in the synthesized perovskites, the elemental analysis is carried out by ICP-MS (Table S1y), which indicates that the actual ratio is generally consistent with the molar feed ratio.

Synthesis of CsPbBr 3 quantum dots with the orthorhombic phase 42.Firstly, PbBr 2 (367.01 mg) was fully dissolved in the mixture of DMF (20 mL), hexanoic acid (232.32 mg) and octylamine (258.48 mg).Subsequently, 1 mL of Cs-oleate solution was added to this solution.Finally, 0.5 mL of the mixed solution was added into a flask with 20 mL of toluene, followed centrifuging and washing process (by ethyl acetate) twice. The powder X-ray diffraction patterns (PXRD) were recorded on a SmartLab X-ray diffractometer.The morphology and nanostructure were investigated on transmission electron microscope (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) (JEM-2100Plus).X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterizations were performed on an Escalab 250 instrument with a monochromatized Al Ka X-ray sources.The absorption behavior of the samples was studied by the UV-vis spectrometer (Shimadzu UV-2600).UV-vis diffuse reflection spectroscopy (DRS) was obtained on a U-3010 spectrophotometer (Hitachi, Japan).Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were scanned on a photoluminescence spectrometer (Hitachi F-4600), under an excitation wavelength of 362 nm except for CsPbCl 3 nanocrystals (excited by 320 nm).The elemental analysis is carried out by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).The film thickness of photoelectrode was determined by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM).The product of the photocatalytic reaction was tested by the GC-9800 spectrometer.The HP 6890GC-5973MSD gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC-MS) was employed to analyze the CO product generated from the 13 CO 2 (98 enriched) isotope experiments. Fabrication of the CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 0.7, 0.5, 0.3) photoelectrodes.The ITO substrate was cleaned by sonicating sequentially in deionized water, alcohol and acetone, each for 10 min.The ITO substrate was divided into the size of approximately 1 cm A 1 cm.A fixed amount of CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0) toluene suspension was subsequently dropped onto the ITO substrate.The as-prepared photoelectrodes were subsequently dried at room temperature overnight. All the photoelectrochemical characterizations were performed on the electrochemical workstation (CHI660e, CH Instruments, Inc., USA) with a three-electrode configuration with the assembled photoelectrodes as the working electrode, the Pt mesh as the counter electrode and the Ag/AgCl (in 3 M KCl) as the reference electrode.The ethyl acetate with 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF 6 ) was filled in the cell as electrolyte.The light source and the light density were identical with that in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction test. Photocatalytic performance tests.The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was conducted in a homemade 75 mL sealed cell with 0.5 mg CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0) nanocrystals as the catalysts and 6 mL ethyl acetate as the solvent.Before the reduction, high purity CO 2 (99.99) gas was bubbled in the ethyl acetate solvent for around 20 min until the CO 2 concentration reached saturation and dissolved oxygen was removed completely.A 300 W Xenon lamp with AM 1.5 filter was used as the light source.The distance between the homemade sealed cell and the 300 W xenon lamp is about 8 cm and the sample geometry of irradiation was about 2 cm A 3 cm.The light intensity was around 200 mW/cm 2 .All of the experiments were carried out under ambient pressure and the reaction system was kept at 20 C under a cooling water system.The gaseous products generated during CO 2 photocatalytic reduction were collected by a 1 mL syringe and then immediately analyzed by GC-9800 equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID), and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) after 9 h. Control experiments.The control experiment was conducted in a homemade 75 mL sealed cell with 0.5 mg CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 nanocrystals as the catalysts and 6 mL ethyl acetate as the solvent.Before the reduction, high purity Ar (99.99) gas was bubbled in the ethyl acetate solvent for around 20 min until the dissolved oxygen was removed completely.A 300 W xenon lamp with AM 1.5 filter was used as the light source.After 9 h, the gaseous products were collected by a 1 mL syringe and then immediately analyzed by GC-9800 equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID), and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Isotopic experiment.The isotopic experiment was conducted in a homemade 75 mL sealed cell with 0.5 mg CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 nanocrystals as the catalysts and 6 mL ethyl acetate as the solvent.Before the reduction, 13 CO 2 (98) gas was bubbled in the ethyl acetate solvent for around 20 min until the dissolved oxygen was removed completely.A 300 W xenon lamp with AM 1.5 filter was used as the light source.After 9 h, the 13 C-labeled product was tested by GC-MS."}, {"llm generation": "Xe-300 lamp (Xenon)", "source": "After irradiation by Xe-300 lamp with AM 1.5 filter within 9 h, CO and CH 4 are generated as the main gas product and the yield is changed with the alteration of Br/Cl ratios in perovskites (Fig. 5a, Tables S2y andS3y).", "context": "The monodispersed mixed-halide perovskites CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 0.7, 0.5, 0.3) were synthesized according to the welldeveloped hot injection method 47.As control in catalytic experiment, CsPbBr 3 and CsPbCl 3 nanocrystals were also prepared through the same approach.Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns show a pure cubic phase of the as-prepared CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0) nanocrystals (Fig. 2e), which is consistent with the previous reports 47,48.Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images presented in Fig. 2a and Fig. S1y exhibit that all CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0) crystals are cubic shape with a size around 10.5 nm (Fig. 2c).Such small particle size will provide guarantee of a large specific surface area for catalysis.Depending on the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (Fig. 2b), the lattice parameter of the CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 materials is 0.57 nm suggesting the as-prepared materials are highly crystalline in perovskite structure.Moreover, the energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectra reveal the existence of Cs, Pb, Br and Cl elements in CsPb (Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 materials (Fig. 2d). We examined the surface chemical binding of CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0) materials with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Fig. S2y).The peaks of Cs 3d of CsPbBr 3 (x 1) at 724.0 and 738.1 eV are gradually red-shift to 723.8 and 737.8 eV (CsPbCl 3 , x 0), respectively (Fig. 3a).For the peaks of Pb 4f, they individually exhibit blue-shift from 137.8 and 142.7 eV of CsPbBr 3 to 138.0 and 142.9 eV of CsPbCl 3 (Fig. 3b).These indicate that bonding environment of Cs and Pb atoms is changed via tuning the ratios of Br/Cl.The peaks of Br 3d and/or Cl 2p in CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0) are almost unchanged (Fig. 3c,d).To better understand the actual ratio of Br/Cl in the synthesized perovskites, the elemental analysis is carried out by ICP-MS (Table S1y), which indicates that the actual ratio is generally consistent with the molar feed ratio. In the following experiments, we studied the optical properties of CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 materials.Firstly, using ethyl acetate as a solvent, light absorption property of CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 was measured.CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 exhibit a good absorption toward the visible light, ranging from 400 to 700 nm (Fig. 4a), which is quite wider than the typical semiconductors, such as TiO 2 , ZnO 6,49,50.With x value increases, the absorption peaking at 520 nm (CsPbBr 3 ) gradually shifts to 420 nm (CsPbCl 3 ).For semiconductor, the band edge positions have a significant influence on the catalytic reactivity.Hence, the band edge positions of CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0) materials were studied.First, the band gap (E g ) of them was decided by UV-vis diffuse reflection spectroscopy (DRS, Fig. S3y) based on Tauc method 51.Fig. 4b shows the (ahm) 2 versus hm curves of CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0) materials with a direct band gap 52.The E g values of CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0) were from 2.33 to 2.98 eV (Table 1) based on the Xaxis intercept of the Tauc plot.The valence band (E VB ) of CsPb (Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0) materials are determined by Valence-band XPS (VB XPS, Fig. 4c and Fig. S4y).The conduction band (E CB ) are determined by the equation 53: According to the band edge positions in Table 1, we can find that E VB enhanced with the increase of Cl content in CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 , while very little change of E CB was observed.Thus, the E VB depends more strongly on the halide composition than E CB .In addition, E CB levels of all as-prepared halide perovskites are higher than the reductive potential of CO 2 to CO (A0.5 eV).Under the excitation of 362 nm (except CsPbCl 3 which was excited by 320 nm), emission spectra of CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0) materials were collected.The emission band peaking at 517 nm is observed on CsPbBr 3 and with the enhancement of Cl content, the peak is gradually shifted to 413 nm (Fig. 4d).To investigate the catalytic activity of mixed-halide perovskite toward CO 2 reduction, the catalytic experiment was carried out following the reaction condition reported by Su and co-workers in which only perovskites and ethyl acetate were used in the system 42.As a control experiment, the catalytic activity of CsPbBr 3 and CsPbCl 3 was also investigated.Firstly, a certain amount of halide perovskites was put into a quartz tube containing 6 mL ethyl acetate.After irradiation by Xe-300 lamp with AM 1.5 filter within 9 h, CO and CH 4 are generated as the main gas product and the yield is changed with the alteration of Br/Cl ratios in perovskites (Fig. 5a, Tables S2y andS3y).With CsPbBr 3 as a catalyst, the yield of CO and CH 4 is 135 and 60 lmol/g, respectively.After displacing Br with Cl at x 0.7, the yield of CO and CH 4 enhances slightly up to 156 and 72 lmol/g.When using CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 as a catalyst, the CO generation undergoes a sharp increase to 767 lmol/g which is 5.7-fold and 4.9-fold higher than that of pure CsPbBr 3 and CsPb(Br 0.7 /Cl 0.3 ) 3 , while CH 4 only exhibits a slight enhancement (108 lmol/g) (Fig. S5ay).However, further enhancing the Cl content (x 0.3 or 0), the production amount of CO and CH 4 in CsPb(Br 0.3 /Cl 0.7 ) 3 or CsPbCl 3 presents an obvious decrease.From these results, we can find Cl introduction has a significant influence on the activity of CO 2 reduction in this photocatalytic system.The optimal catalyst is CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 with a total catalytic yield of CO and CH 4 up to 875 lmol/g which is around 4.5 and 9.1 times higher than the performance of CsPbBr 3 and CsPbCl 3 materials.What's more, the common byproduct H 2 is avoided in all of CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 catalyst and the selectivity toward CO and CH 4 is up to 99. CsPbBr 3 QDs with the orthorhombic phase are first reported as a photocatalyst for CO 2 photoreduction 42.To get an unambiguous evaluation about mixed-halide strategy in CO 2 photoreduction, the orthorhombic CsPbBr 3 sample was employed as a catalyst in our experimental condition (Fig. S5by).After 9 h reaction, around 112 lmol/g CO and 33 lmol/g CH 4 are produced and the total generation amount (145 lmol/g) is 1/6 of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 and comparable with that of cubic CsPbBr 3 (195 lmol/g).Compared with the mixed-halide strategy, crystal phase (orthorhombic or cubic) has a little effect on the CO 2 photoreduction performance.Moreover, the total yield of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 perovskite toward CO 2 reduction is much better than that of reported popular catalysts, such as TiO 2 , CdS and g-C 3 N 4 under similar condition (Table S4y).To better confirm the advantage of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 perovskite over these materials in CO 2 reduction, the activity of g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets and TiO 2 (P25) were studied under the same catalytic condition (Table S5y).The photocatalytic results demonstrate that the reactivity of g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets and TiO 2 (P25) is around 10-fold and 5-fold lower than that of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 respectively. The CO 2 photoreduction activity of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 materials within different time was investigated by detecting the amounts of CO and CH 4 every three hours (Fig. 5b).Within the period, the outputs of CO and CH 4 are 250 20 and 25.0 2 lmol/g, respectively.These results present that CO and CH 4 almost linearly increase during the 9 h irradiation.These results imply that CsPb (Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 materials might have a moderate stability during photocatalysis.To compare the performance of different catalysts via tuning ratios of Br/Cl during different reaction time, the experiments were carried out (Fig. S6y).The higher generation speed of CO than that of CH 4 may result from the needed multi-electrons pathway in CH 4 formation.The decrease of CH 4 amount after 9 h reaction may ascribe to the discontinuous irradiation which severely affects electrons accumulation to feed 8 electrons route. The control experiment was investigated to determine the source of the gas product under an inert Ar gas atmosphere.After 9 h irradiation, CO and CO 2 were generated with the amount of 94 and 430 lmol/g by CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 , respectively.The CO yield under Ar is around one-in-eight of that under saturated CO 2 (767 lmol/g) which means that a small quantity of CO generated from the photosynthesis system due to partial photooxidation of ethyl acetate.To further make sure the carbon source of the reaction product, gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC-MS) was used to detect CO under 13 CO 2 atmosphere using CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 as catalysts (Fig. 6).The result of isotopic experiment indicates that about 85 of CO comes from 13 CO 2 photoreduction. Besides activity, the stability of a catalyst is another significant factor affecting the catalytic efficiency.To illuminate the stability of mixed-halide perovskite materials, we studied the crystalline phase after photocatalysis.No obvious changes in PXRD patterns of CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 0.7, 0.5, 0.3) are observed after photocatalysis.Contrast to mixed-halide perovskite, the PXRD pattern of CsPbCl 3 after catalysis was kept intact but the one of CsPbBr 3 (Fig. 7a) shows a few new peaks (CsPb 2 Br 5 ).These results imply mixed-halide perovskite materials may have better stability than that of bare CsPbBr 3 , and indicate that the introduction of Cl in halide perovskite could be a promising way to enhance the stability of perovskite in CO 2 photoreduction to some extent. Considering the PXRD results, the reusable experiment was conducted (Fig. S7y).After second recycle (corresponding to 18 h reaction), around 42 and 56 decrease in CO and CH 4 generation with CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 as catalyst was observed, however, after third recycle (corresponding to 27 h reaction), the yield of both CO and CH 4 sharply reduced to 38 and 23.The decrease of catalytic activity may result from the moderate durability of perovskite materials under the long-time irradiation.For other CsPb (Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 0, 0.3, 0.7, 1), with the Cl content enhanced, the reduced degree in reactivity decreased.According to these experiments, the ratio of Br and Cl at 0.5:0.5 should be the most active rather than the most stable.The advantage in band energy and the moderate stability of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 may make it be the most appropriate catalyst for CO 2 photoreduction.Fig. 6.The GC-MS result of an isotopic experiment with 13 CO 2 as carbon sources using CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 as the catalyst.Given that charge separation plays a crucial role in the redox reaction, transient photocurrent responses were employed to reveal the rooted reason behind the predominant photocatalytic performance of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 materials in CO 2 reduction.First, the photoelectrodes were prepared and the thickness of the film cross-section was determined by SEM image of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 photoelectrode (Fig. S8y).The photocurrent responses were collected under Xe-300 lamp with AM 1.5 filter under dark and light conditions.In Fig. 7b, the photocurrent density of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 elevates rapidly up to 4.4 lA/cm 2 during light irradiation and then decreases sharply under the dark condition, which can be successively implemented for multiple times.Other mixed-halide perovskites CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 0.7, 0.3) have similar phenomena during on-off irradiation but with low photocurrent density.These results illuminate the charge separation of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 is more efficient than the other two mixed-halide perovskites.Together with the band energy and the advantage in moderate stability, CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 may be the most appropriate catalyst for CO 2 photoreduction."}, {"llm generation": "Xe-300 lamp", "source": "Fig. 1.Scheme of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction based on CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 0.7, 0.5, 0.3) nanocrystals under Xe-300 lamp illumination with AM 1.5 filter.", "context": "In summary, we provide a strategy to enhance the CO 2 photoreduction efficiency, exploring low-cost and selective mixed-halide perovskite CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 0.7, 0.5, 0.3) materials as catalysts.Via hot-injection method, these mixed-halide perovskites with cubic phase and a size of 10.5 nm are prepared, which exhibit excellent visible-light absorption property.The E g of these mixed-halide perovskite ranges from 2.51 to 2.83 eV which is smaller than classical semiconductors, such as TiO 2 and ZnO.The E CB of them is all around A1.70 eV, higher than the reductive potential of CO 2 to CO (A0.5 eV) which provides the guarantee for CO 2 photoreduction.Under simulated sunlight and absence of additive of the photosensitizer, mixed-halide perovskites exhibit excellent photocatalytic efficiency and selectivity in converting CO 2 to CO and CH 4 .The ratio of Br and Cl in perovskite materials has a significant effect on the photocatalytic performance.The optimized catalyst is CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 with a total amount of 875 lmol/g of CO and CH 4 (selectivity of 99) which is 4.5, 9.1 and 6 folds higher than the yield of CsPbBr 3 , CsPbCl 3 and CsPbBr 3 with orthorhombic phase under the same condition.The moderate stability and appropriate band energy of mixed-halide perovskite may account for the high yield of CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 .The more efficient charge separation of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 than that of CsPb (Br 0.7 /Cl 0.3 ) 3 and CsPb(Br 0.3 /Cl 0.7 ) 3 may lead to the higher activity of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 .What's more, this activity and selectivity of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 outperform popular semiconductor catalysts, such as TiO 2 , CdS and g-C 3 N 4 .We believe that these findings pave new routes in designing efficient, selective and low-cost perovskite for CO 2 photoreduction.

In the following experiments, we studied the optical properties of CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 materials.Firstly, using ethyl acetate as a solvent, light absorption property of CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 was measured.CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 exhibit a good absorption toward the visible light, ranging from 400 to 700 nm (Fig. 4a), which is quite wider than the typical semiconductors, such as TiO 2 , ZnO 6,49,50.With x value increases, the absorption peaking at 520 nm (CsPbBr 3 ) gradually shifts to 420 nm (CsPbCl 3 ).For semiconductor, the band edge positions have a significant influence on the catalytic reactivity.Hence, the band edge positions of CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0) materials were studied.First, the band gap (E g ) of them was decided by UV-vis diffuse reflection spectroscopy (DRS, Fig. S3y) based on Tauc method 51.Fig. 4b shows the (ahm) 2 versus hm curves of CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0) materials with a direct band gap 52.The E g values of CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0) were from 2.33 to 2.98 eV (Table 1) based on the Xaxis intercept of the Tauc plot.The valence band (E VB ) of CsPb (Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0) materials are determined by Valence-band XPS (VB XPS, Fig. 4c and Fig. S4y).The conduction band (E CB ) are determined by the equation 53: According to the band edge positions in Table 1, we can find that E VB enhanced with the increase of Cl content in CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 , while very little change of E CB was observed.Thus, the E VB depends more strongly on the halide composition than E CB .In addition, E CB levels of all as-prepared halide perovskites are higher than the reductive potential of CO 2 to CO (A0.5 eV).Under the excitation of 362 nm (except CsPbCl 3 which was excited by 320 nm), emission spectra of CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0) materials were collected.The emission band peaking at 517 nm is observed on CsPbBr 3 and with the enhancement of Cl content, the peak is gradually shifted to 413 nm (Fig. 4d).To investigate the catalytic activity of mixed-halide perovskite toward CO 2 reduction, the catalytic experiment was carried out following the reaction condition reported by Su and co-workers in which only perovskites and ethyl acetate were used in the system 42.As a control experiment, the catalytic activity of CsPbBr 3 and CsPbCl 3 was also investigated.Firstly, a certain amount of halide perovskites was put into a quartz tube containing 6 mL ethyl acetate.After irradiation by Xe-300 lamp with AM 1.5 filter within 9 h, CO and CH 4 are generated as the main gas product and the yield is changed with the alteration of Br/Cl ratios in perovskites (Fig. 5a, Tables S2y andS3y).With CsPbBr 3 as a catalyst, the yield of CO and CH 4 is 135 and 60 lmol/g, respectively.After displacing Br with Cl at x 0.7, the yield of CO and CH 4 enhances slightly up to 156 and 72 lmol/g.When using CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 as a catalyst, the CO generation undergoes a sharp increase to 767 lmol/g which is 5.7-fold and 4.9-fold higher than that of pure CsPbBr 3 and CsPb(Br 0.7 /Cl 0.3 ) 3 , while CH 4 only exhibits a slight enhancement (108 lmol/g) (Fig. S5ay).However, further enhancing the Cl content (x 0.3 or 0), the production amount of CO and CH 4 in CsPb(Br 0.3 /Cl 0.7 ) 3 or CsPbCl 3 presents an obvious decrease.From these results, we can find Cl introduction has a significant influence on the activity of CO 2 reduction in this photocatalytic system.The optimal catalyst is CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 with a total catalytic yield of CO and CH 4 up to 875 lmol/g which is around 4.5 and 9.1 times higher than the performance of CsPbBr 3 and CsPbCl 3 materials.What's more, the common byproduct H 2 is avoided in all of CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 catalyst and the selectivity toward CO and CH 4 is up to 99. CsPbBr 3 QDs with the orthorhombic phase are first reported as a photocatalyst for CO 2 photoreduction 42.To get an unambiguous evaluation about mixed-halide strategy in CO 2 photoreduction, the orthorhombic CsPbBr 3 sample was employed as a catalyst in our experimental condition (Fig. S5by).After 9 h reaction, around 112 lmol/g CO and 33 lmol/g CH 4 are produced and the total generation amount (145 lmol/g) is 1/6 of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 and comparable with that of cubic CsPbBr 3 (195 lmol/g).Compared with the mixed-halide strategy, crystal phase (orthorhombic or cubic) has a little effect on the CO 2 photoreduction performance.Moreover, the total yield of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 perovskite toward CO 2 reduction is much better than that of reported popular catalysts, such as TiO 2 , CdS and g-C 3 N 4 under similar condition (Table S4y).To better confirm the advantage of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 perovskite over these materials in CO 2 reduction, the activity of g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets and TiO 2 (P25) were studied under the same catalytic condition (Table S5y).The photocatalytic results demonstrate that the reactivity of g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets and TiO 2 (P25) is around 10-fold and 5-fold lower than that of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 respectively. The CO 2 photoreduction activity of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 materials within different time was investigated by detecting the amounts of CO and CH 4 every three hours (Fig. 5b).Within the period, the outputs of CO and CH 4 are 250 20 and 25.0 2 lmol/g, respectively.These results present that CO and CH 4 almost linearly increase during the 9 h irradiation.These results imply that CsPb (Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 materials might have a moderate stability during photocatalysis.To compare the performance of different catalysts via tuning ratios of Br/Cl during different reaction time, the experiments were carried out (Fig. S6y).The higher generation speed of CO than that of CH 4 may result from the needed multi-electrons pathway in CH 4 formation.The decrease of CH 4 amount after 9 h reaction may ascribe to the discontinuous irradiation which severely affects electrons accumulation to feed 8 electrons route. The control experiment was investigated to determine the source of the gas product under an inert Ar gas atmosphere.After 9 h irradiation, CO and CO 2 were generated with the amount of 94 and 430 lmol/g by CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 , respectively.The CO yield under Ar is around one-in-eight of that under saturated CO 2 (767 lmol/g) which means that a small quantity of CO generated from the photosynthesis system due to partial photooxidation of ethyl acetate.To further make sure the carbon source of the reaction product, gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC-MS) was used to detect CO under 13 CO 2 atmosphere using CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 as catalysts (Fig. 6).The result of isotopic experiment indicates that about 85 of CO comes from 13 CO 2 photoreduction. Besides activity, the stability of a catalyst is another significant factor affecting the catalytic efficiency.To illuminate the stability of mixed-halide perovskite materials, we studied the crystalline phase after photocatalysis.No obvious changes in PXRD patterns of CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 0.7, 0.5, 0.3) are observed after photocatalysis.Contrast to mixed-halide perovskite, the PXRD pattern of CsPbCl 3 after catalysis was kept intact but the one of CsPbBr 3 (Fig. 7a) shows a few new peaks (CsPb 2 Br 5 ).These results imply mixed-halide perovskite materials may have better stability than that of bare CsPbBr 3 , and indicate that the introduction of Cl in halide perovskite could be a promising way to enhance the stability of perovskite in CO 2 photoreduction to some extent. Considering the PXRD results, the reusable experiment was conducted (Fig. S7y).After second recycle (corresponding to 18 h reaction), around 42 and 56 decrease in CO and CH 4 generation with CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 as catalyst was observed, however, after third recycle (corresponding to 27 h reaction), the yield of both CO and CH 4 sharply reduced to 38 and 23.The decrease of catalytic activity may result from the moderate durability of perovskite materials under the long-time irradiation.For other CsPb (Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 0, 0.3, 0.7, 1), with the Cl content enhanced, the reduced degree in reactivity decreased.According to these experiments, the ratio of Br and Cl at 0.5:0.5 should be the most active rather than the most stable.The advantage in band energy and the moderate stability of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 may make it be the most appropriate catalyst for CO 2 photoreduction.Fig. 6.The GC-MS result of an isotopic experiment with 13 CO 2 as carbon sources using CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 as the catalyst.Given that charge separation plays a crucial role in the redox reaction, transient photocurrent responses were employed to reveal the rooted reason behind the predominant photocatalytic performance of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 materials in CO 2 reduction.First, the photoelectrodes were prepared and the thickness of the film cross-section was determined by SEM image of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 photoelectrode (Fig. S8y).The photocurrent responses were collected under Xe-300 lamp with AM 1.5 filter under dark and light conditions.In Fig. 7b, the photocurrent density of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 elevates rapidly up to 4.4 lA/cm 2 during light irradiation and then decreases sharply under the dark condition, which can be successively implemented for multiple times.Other mixed-halide perovskites CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 0.7, 0.3) have similar phenomena during on-off irradiation but with low photocurrent density.These results illuminate the charge separation of CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 is more efficient than the other two mixed-halide perovskites.Together with the band energy and the advantage in moderate stability, CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 may be the most appropriate catalyst for CO 2 photoreduction."}, {"llm generation": "ethyl acetate", "source": "Firstly, a certain amount of halide perovskites was put into a quartz tube containing 6 mL ethyl acetate.", "context": "The monodispersed mixed-halide perovskites CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 0.7, 0.5, 0.3) were synthesized according to the welldeveloped hot injection method 47.As control in catalytic experiment, CsPbBr 3 and CsPbCl 3 nanocrystals were also prepared through the same approach.Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns show a pure cubic phase of the as-prepared CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0) nanocrystals (Fig. 2e), which is consistent with the previous reports 47,48.Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images presented in Fig. 2a and Fig. S1y exhibit that all CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0) crystals are cubic shape with a size around 10.5 nm (Fig. 2c).Such small particle size will provide guarantee of a large specific surface area for catalysis.Depending on the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (Fig. 2b), the lattice parameter of the CsPb(Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 materials is 0.57 nm suggesting the as-prepared materials are highly crystalline in perovskite structure.Moreover, the energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectra reveal the existence of Cs, Pb, Br and Cl elements in CsPb (Br 0.5 /Cl 0.5 ) 3 materials (Fig. 2d). We examined the surface chemical binding of CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0) materials with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Fig. S2y).The peaks of Cs 3d of CsPbBr 3 (x 1) at 724.0 and 738.1 eV are gradually red-shift to 723.8 and 737.8 eV (CsPbCl 3 , x 0), respectively (Fig. 3a).For the peaks of Pb 4f, they individually exhibit blue-shift from 137.8 and 142.7 eV of CsPbBr 3 to 138.0 and 142.9 eV of CsPbCl 3 (Fig. 3b).These indicate that bonding environment of Cs and Pb atoms is changed via tuning the ratios of Br/Cl.The peaks of Br 3d and/or Cl 2p in CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0) are almost unchanged (Fig. 3c,d).To better understand the actual ratio of Br/Cl in the synthesized perovskites, the elemental analysis is carried out by ICP-MS (Table S1y), which indicates that the actual ratio is generally consistent with the molar feed ratio.

Synthesis of CsPbBr 3 quantum dots with the orthorhombic phase 42.Firstly, PbBr 2 (367.01 mg) was fully dissolved in the mixture of DMF (20 mL), hexanoic acid (232.32 mg) and octylamine (258.48 mg).Subsequently, 1 mL of Cs-oleate solution was added to this solution.Finally, 0.5 mL of the mixed solution was added into a flask with 20 mL of toluene, followed centrifuging and washing process (by ethyl acetate) twice. The powder X-ray diffraction patterns (PXRD) were recorded on a SmartLab X-ray diffractometer.The morphology and nanostructure were investigated on transmission electron microscope (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) (JEM-2100Plus).X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterizations were performed on an Escalab 250 instrument with a monochromatized Al Ka X-ray sources.The absorption behavior of the samples was studied by the UV-vis spectrometer (Shimadzu UV-2600).UV-vis diffuse reflection spectroscopy (DRS) was obtained on a U-3010 spectrophotometer (Hitachi, Japan).Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were scanned on a photoluminescence spectrometer (Hitachi F-4600), under an excitation wavelength of 362 nm except for CsPbCl 3 nanocrystals (excited by 320 nm).The elemental analysis is carried out by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).The film thickness of photoelectrode was determined by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM).The product of the photocatalytic reaction was tested by the GC-9800 spectrometer.The HP 6890GC-5973MSD gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC-MS) was employed to analyze the CO product generated from the 13 CO 2 (98 enriched) isotope experiments. Fabrication of the CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 0.7, 0.5, 0.3) photoelectrodes.The ITO substrate was cleaned by sonicating sequentially in deionized water, alcohol and acetone, each for 10 min.The ITO substrate was divided into the size of approximately 1 cm A 1 cm.A fixed amount of CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0) toluene suspension was subsequently dropped onto the ITO substrate.The as-prepared photoelectrodes were subsequently dried at room temperature overnight. All the photoelectrochemical characterizations were performed on the electrochemical workstation (CHI660e, CH Instruments, Inc., USA) with a three-electrode configuration with the assembled photoelectrodes as the working electrode, the Pt mesh as the counter electrode and the Ag/AgCl (in 3 M KCl) as the reference electrode.The ethyl acetate with 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF 6 ) was filled in the cell as electrolyte.The light source and the light density were identical with that in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction test. Photocatalytic performance tests.The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was conducted in a homemade 75 mL sealed cell with 0.5 mg CsPb(Br x /Cl 1Ax ) 3 (x 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0) nanocrystals as the catalysts and 6 mL ethyl acetate as the solvent.Before the reduction, high purity CO 2 (99.99) gas was bubbled in the ethyl acetate solvent for around 20 min until the CO 2 concentration reached saturation and dissolved oxygen was removed completely.A 300 W Xenon lamp with AM 1.5 filter was used as the light source.The distance between the homemade sealed cell and the 300 W xenon lamp is about 8 cm and the sample geometry of irradiation was about 2 cm A 3 cm.The light intensity was around 200 mW/cm 2 .All of the experiments were carried out under ambient pressure and the reaction system was kept at 20 C under a cooling water system.The gaseous products generated during CO 2 photocatalytic reduction were collected by a 1 mL syringe and then immediately analyzed by GC-9800 equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID), and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) after 9 h.
