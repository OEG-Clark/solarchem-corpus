30 : 50 : 20, w/w/w), independent submicron-sized spherical particles were successfully obtained (Fig. 1d).Although the reason why the unique spherical Ta 2 O 5 particles were obtained with this solvent composition is not clear, it is considered that the addition of ethylene glycol with high viscosity affects the hydrolysis and condensation rate of the Ta source and the dispersibility of the formed particles. 31-ray diffraction patterns of the Ta 2 O 5 spheres obtained with the water-methanol-ethylene glycol co-solvent system were measured to investigate the regularity of the mesopores.Fig. S1 (ESI ) shows the XRD pattern with a diffraction peak around 2q 14 2 .The pattern is identical to that for a wormhole-like mesoporous structure obtained by the conventional method. 26he nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm of the MTS (Fig. S2,ESI ) is type IV, and the BET specific surface area and BJH pore diameter were determined to be 460 m 2 g A1 and 3.4 nm, respectively.These characteristics are similar to those of mesoporous Ta 2 O 5 obtained by the conventional method, 26 which indicates that this new methodology is capable of producing spherical mesoporous Ta 2 O 5 particles.In addition, wormholelike mesoporous structures of MTS were identified by TEM observation, which supports the XRD result (Fig. S3,ESI ).These results confirm that mesoporous Ta 2 O 5 spheres (MTS) were successfully prepared for the first time. Crystallized MTS (CMTS) were prepared by reinforcing MTS with carbon.Fig. 2 shows SEM and FE-SEM images of the resultant CMTS prepared under various conditions.The SEM image of CMTS heat-treated at 1073 K (CMTS-1073K) confirmed that the spherical morphology was mostly retained (Fig. 2a).FE-SEM observation showed that the CMTS consist of nanoparticles with particle sizes of ca. 10 nm (Fig. 2b).TEM observation of the corresponding sample (Fig. S4a,ESI ) also revealed that the wormhole-like mesostructure of MTS was lost during heat-treatment, while the nanoparticles were homogeneously dispersed in the submicron-sized spherical particles.This is in good agreement with the results from the FE-SEM image.The corresponding XRD pattern (Fig. 3b) has very broad peaks assignable to typical orthorhombic Ta 2 O 5 , which suggests the formation of Ta 2 O 5 nanocrystals.The crystallite size of CMTS-1073K was estimated to be 12.8 nm using the Scherrer equation (Table 1), which agrees well with that determined from the FE-SEM and TEM images. The FE-SEM images (Fig. 2b andc) show that heat-treatment conducted at a higher temperature (1173 K; CMTS-1173K) resulted in a larger nanocrystal size (ca.15 nm).The submicronsized spherical particle shape was mostly retained, even though aggregation of Ta 2 O 5 nanocrystals occurred during heat-treatment at higher than 1073 K.When heat-treatment was performed at 1073 K without carbon-filling (non-CMTS), the morphology of the particles was entirely changed and large primary particles with diameters in the range of 40-200 nm were obtained (Fig. 2d).This result strongly indicates that carbon plays an important role in retaining the spherical shape of the MTS and forming nanocrystals during crystallization.The structures of the CMTS are similar to monodispersed mesoporous tin oxide spheres (MMTOS) prepared using MSCS as a host 29 and these results indicate that this simple procedure of direct CMTS preparation using carbon reinforcement could be applicable to the direct crystallization of other mesoporous metal oxides. The XRD patterns shown in Fig. 3 indicate that the peaks for CMTS became larger and sharper with increased calcination temperature.Table 1 lists the crystallite size estimated using the Scherrer equation, which increased from 12.8 to 15.1 nm by increasing the temperature from 1073 to 1173 K.The small-angle peak at 2q 14 2 observed for amorphous MTS was absent in the XRD patterns for all heat-treated samples (data not shown), which suggests that the wormhole-like mesostructure of MTS was lost during crystallization. Fig. 4 shows nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms for CMTS, and the total pore volume, specific surface area, and average pore diameter calculated from the isotherms are listed in Table 1.All of the isotherms of the CMTS samples obtained by carbon-reinforcement are type IV curves (Fig. 4A(a-c)), which indicates a mesoporous structure, while non-CMTS obtained without carbon-filling exhibited poor nitrogen adsorption and thus no mesoporosity (Fig. 4A(d)).CMTS had a relatively high specific surface area (45-105 m 2 g A1 ) and mesopores with average diameters in the range of 5.6-17 nm (Table 1) after crystallization.TEM and XRD results confirmed that the Ta 2 O 5 nanocrystal size increased with temperature, resulting in larger pore diameter and smaller specific surface area.Therefore, the pore diameter of CMTS can be easily tunable by changing the crystallization temperature.During the calcination of the CMTScarbon composite, carbon was removed by combustion, generating interparticle nanospaces between the Ta 2 O 5 nanocrystals, so that submicron-sized CMTS with different pore sizes were successfully obtained. Ta 2 O 5 exhibits photocatalytic activity for H 2 evolution under UV irradiation (320 nm). 12319,9,25 To investigate the effect of the surface area and morphology of Ta 2 O 5 on photocatalytic activity, photocatalytic reactions of various CMTS samples and Ta 2 O 5 powder were performed in aqueous solutions containing methanol (20 vol), pre-purged with Ar gas under UV irradiation for 24 h.The results given in Table S1 (ESI ) suggest that the surface area, particle size and crystalline structure of Ta 2 O 5 have a significant effect on the photocatalytic activity for H 2 evolution and that CMTS is an excellent photocatalyst with the highest amount of H 2 evolution due to its controlled morphology and large surface area compared with other mesoporous or nonmesoporous Ta 2 O 5 particles that have been previously reported.The catalytic activity of the CMTS catalysts was dependent on the specific surface area, and CMTS-1073K with the highest surface area of 105 m 2 g A1 gave the highest amount of evolved H 2 . N-doping of CMTS was conducted to sensitize CMTS to visible light.CMTS-1073K, which had the highest photocatalytic H 2 evolution rate, was subjected to treatment with gaseous NH 3 .To date, the preparation of N-Ta 2 O 5 for photoenergy conversion has only been reported for N-doping of non-porous Ta 2 O 5 -fine. 91011 The particle size and specific surface area of Ta 2 O 5 -fine were 20-40 nm and 24 m 2 g A1 , respectively (Fig. S5b, ESI ).For comparison, N-doping of Ta 2 O 5 -fine (N-Ta 2 O 5 -fine) was also conducted and the morphological properties are summarized in Table 2.The color of CMTS became yellowish by NH 3 treatment at 873 K, and the XRD peaks for N-CMTS remained unchanged from those for CMTS.No TaON or Ta 3 N 5 peaks were detected, as previously reported (Fig. S6, ESI ), 9 which indicates that N-doping of orthorhombic CMTS was successfully achieved.It was also confirmed that N-CMTS mostly retained the mesoporosity and morphology of CMTS, as determined by nitrogen adsorptiondesorption measurement and FE-SEM observation (Table 2 and Fig. S7,ESI ).The UV-vis diffuse reflection spectrum of N-CMTS shown in Fig. S8 (ESI ) indicates that no blue shift originated from the quantum size effect was observed compared to that of N-Ta 2 O 5 -fine.XPS analysis determined the nitrogen concentration to be 5.0 at (Table 2).Thus, N-CMTS consists of N-Ta 2 O 5 nanocrystals.In addition, both peaks around 400 and 396.6 eV were observed in the XPS spectra (Fig. S9,ESI ), which indicate that N-CMTS is a p-type semiconductor whose conduction band minimum (E CBM ) and valence band maximum (E VBM ) of N-CMTS are likely to be located at A1.3 V (vs.NHE) and 1.1 V, respectively, as we have recently confirmed. 9otocatalytic hydrogen evolution and CO 2 reduction under visible light irradiation using N-CMTS Photocatalytic H 2 evolution reactions of N-CMTS were performed in acetonitrile under visible light (410 nm) irradiation using triethanolamine (TEOA) as an electron donor and proton source and the results are summarized in Table 3. N-CMTS were found to be excellent visible light-sensitive photocatalysts and showed 2.1 times higher photocatalytic H 2 evolution activity than non-porous N-Ta 2 O 5 fine particles.The excellent photocatalytic activity of N-CMTS is considered to result from their morphology and their higher surface area.However, the advantage of the high surface area of N-CMTS is not fully exploited due to its lower crystallinity compared to that of N-Ta 2 O 5 -fine (Fig. S6, ESI ).The improvement of the crystallization process, such as the elongation of the thermal treatment time, would further enhance the photocatalytic activity of N-CMTS.In addition, the retention of the photocatalytic activity of N-CMTS even after 72 h of photoreaction is responsible for the stability of N-Ta 2 O 5 photocatalyst (Fig. S10, ESI ).Hybrid photocatalysts for CO 2 reduction consisting of a ruthenium complex and N-CMTS anchored by phosphonate (Ru-dpbpy-N-CMTS) were prepared by a direct assembly method (Fig. S11, ESI ), and the successful anchoring of Rudpbpy complex on N-CMTS was confirmed by ATR-FTIR spectroscopy, as previously reported for N-Ta 2 O 5 -fine.11 The Ru content of Ru-dpbpy-N-CMTS was determined by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) analysis.Although the maximum Ru content of the composite was 0.07 wt when non-mesoporous N-Ta 2 O 5 -fine was used as the semiconductor, this was increased to 0.12 wt for Ru-dpbpy-N-CMTS, which suggests that the larger surface area of N-CMTS enabled more incorporation of the Ru-dpbpy than N-Ta 2 O 5 -fine.The specific surface area and pore size of Ru-dpbpy-N-CMTS were measured by nitrogen adsorption-desorption after the incorporation of 0.12 wt Ru-dpbpy, and were found to have decreased from 86 m 2 g A1 and 6.8 nm to 70 m 2 g A1 and 6.4 nm, respectively (Fig. S12,ESI ), which indicates that Ru-dpbpy was successfully incorporated into the mesopores of nanocrystalline N-CMTS. Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with the hybrid photocatalysts was performed in MeCN/TEOA solution under visible light (410 nm) irradiation and the results are summarized in Table 3.For all hybrid samples containing the Ru-complex, the main photocatalytic reaction product from CO 2 was HCOOH. 10,32The mechanism of CO 2 reduction with this system was systematically analyzed.The visible light-excited electrons in the conduction band (CB) and the shallow defect levels in the bandgap of N-Ta 2 O 5 induced by the Ta 5f / N 2p transition are transferred to the Ru-complex catalyst within tens of picoseconds, and the transfer leads to the two-electron reduction of CO 2 to HCOOH. 12Comparison of Ru-dpbpy N-CMTS with Ru-dpbpy-N-Ta 2 O 5 -fine containing the same quantity of Ru (0.05 wt) showed that the amounts of HCOOH generated were similar, irrespective of the mesoporosity (4.7 and 4.4 mmol).This strongly suggests that photocatalytic CO 2 reduction occurs on Ru-dpbpy incorporated in the mesopores of N-CMTS.In the case of Ru-dpbpy-N-Ta 2 O 5 -fine with the highest Ru content (0.07 wt), the amount of HCOOH generated was very close to that of Ru-dpbpy-N-Ta 2 O 5 -fine with a lower Ru content (0.05 wt), which implies that the optimum amount of Ru-dpbpy for the Ru-dpbpy-N-Ta 2 O 5 -fine catalyst is approximately 0.05 wt.The limit of the Ru-dpbpy content is determined by the trade-off between the surface area necessary for simultaneous CO 2 reduction and TEOA oxidation to occur on N-Ta 2 O 5 .The coverage of Ru-dpbpy on Ru-dpbpy-N-Ta 2 O 5 -fine containing 0.05 wt Ru was estimated to be ca.16. In contrast, for Ru-dpbpy-N-CMTS containing 0.12 wt Ru, the amount of HCOOH generated was approximately 1.5 times higher than that for Ru-dpbpy-N-CMTS containing 0.05 wt Ru, which suggests that the Ru-complex incorporated into the mesopores of N-CMTS could be involved in the photocatalytic reaction.Although all of the Ru-complexes on N-CMTS were not involved in the catalytic reaction, the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to HCOOH was enhanced for N-CMTS over that for N-Ta 2 O 5 -fine.This is because the optimum loading amount of Ru-dpbpy, which is determined by the balance between the CO 2 reduction and TEOA oxidation, shifted to a higher value due to the higher surface area of N-CMTS.It has not yet been clarified if the submicron-sized spherical morphology of N-CMTS enhances the optical absorption due to light scattering.However, it is presumable that a porous semiconductor with large specific surface area composed of nanocrystals could be an excellent candidate for the photoactive framework of a hybrid photocatalyst for CO 2 reduction, because sufficient space is available for the incorporation of functional materials such as metal-complex catalysts, co-catalysts, and other semiconductor nanoparticles."}, {"llm generation": "CMTS samples and Ta 2 O 5 powder", "source": "To investigate the effect of the surface area and morphology of Ta 2 O 5 on photocatalytic activity, photocatalytic reactions of various CMTS samples and Ta 2 O 5 powder were performed in aqueous solutions containing methanol (20 vol), pre-purged with Ar gas under UV irradiation for 24 h.", "context": "The synthesis of amorphous Ta 2 O 5 particles was conducted using a modified ligand-assisted templating method, in which a mixture of Ta(OEt) 5 -octadecylamine was hydrolyzed in a dilute water/ organic solvent.The method employed here is based on that employed for the synthesis of mesoporous silica, in which morphological control of the particles was achieved using a large amount of solvent for hydrolysis and condensation of the silica source. 30ig. 1 shows SEM images of Ta 2 O 5 particles obtained using various solvent compositions.The particles obtained in water consisted of many agglomerates greater than 1 mm in size comprised of Ta 2 O 5 fine particles, which suggests that the fine particles formed clump together due to the fast hydrolysis and condensation rate of the tantalum source (Fig. 1a).The result was similar to that for mesoporous Ta 2 O 5 particles obtained by the conventional ligand-assisted templating method (hereafter referred to as the conventional method), 26 which indicates that utilization of a large amount of water is not effective for morphological control.To overcome this tendency, a study was conducted in which co-solvent was added to water to control the hydrolysis and condensation rate of Ta(OEt) 5 .No significant change in the particle morphology was evident with 50 : 50 (w/w) water-methanol, compared with that of the particles obtained with the water system (Fig. 1b), while particles containing both spheres and irregular particles were obtained using a waterethylene glycol solvent system (Fig. 1c).Furthermore, when both methanol and ethylene glycol were used as co-solvents (watermethanol-ethylene glycol; 30 : 50 : 20, w/w/w), independent submicron-sized spherical particles were successfully obtained (Fig. 1d).Although the reason why the unique spherical Ta 2 O 5 particles were obtained with this solvent composition is not clear, it is considered that the addition of ethylene glycol with high viscosity affects the hydrolysis and condensation rate of the Ta source and the dispersibility of the formed particles. 31-ray diffraction patterns of the Ta 2 O 5 spheres obtained with the water-methanol-ethylene glycol co-solvent system were measured to investigate the regularity of the mesopores.Fig. S1 (ESI ) shows the XRD pattern with a diffraction peak around 2q 14 2 .The pattern is identical to that for a wormhole-like mesoporous structure obtained by the conventional method. 26he nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm of the MTS (Fig. S2,ESI ) is type IV, and the BET specific surface area and BJH pore diameter were determined to be 460 m 2 g A1 and 3.4 nm, respectively.These characteristics are similar to those of mesoporous Ta 2 O 5 obtained by the conventional method, 26 which indicates that this new methodology is capable of producing spherical mesoporous Ta 2 O 5 particles.In addition, wormholelike mesoporous structures of MTS were identified by TEM observation, which supports the XRD result (Fig. S3,ESI ).These results confirm that mesoporous Ta 2 O 5 spheres (MTS) were successfully prepared for the first time.

Ta 2 O 5 exhibits photocatalytic activity for H 2 evolution under UV irradiation (320 nm). 12319,9,25 To investigate the effect of the surface area and morphology of Ta 2 O 5 on photocatalytic activity, photocatalytic reactions of various CMTS samples and Ta 2 O 5 powder were performed in aqueous solutions containing methanol (20 vol), pre-purged with Ar gas under UV irradiation for 24 h.The results given in Table S1 (ESI ) suggest that the surface area, particle size and crystalline structure of Ta 2 O 5 have a significant effect on the photocatalytic activity for H 2 evolution and that CMTS is an excellent photocatalyst with the highest amount of H 2 evolution due to its controlled morphology and large surface area compared with other mesoporous or nonmesoporous Ta 2 O 5 particles that have been previously reported.The catalytic activity of the CMTS catalysts was dependent on the specific surface area, and CMTS-1073K with the highest surface area of 105 m 2 g A1 gave the highest amount of evolved H 2 . N-doping of CMTS was conducted to sensitize CMTS to visible light.CMTS-1073K, which had the highest photocatalytic H 2 evolution rate, was subjected to treatment with gaseous NH 3 .To date, the preparation of N-Ta 2 O 5 for photoenergy conversion has only been reported for N-doping of non-porous Ta 2 O 5 -fine. 91011 The particle size and specific surface area of Ta 2 O 5 -fine were 20-40 nm and 24 m 2 g A1 , respectively (Fig. S5b, ESI ).For comparison, N-doping of Ta 2 O 5 -fine (N-Ta 2 O 5 -fine) was also conducted and the morphological properties are summarized in Table 2.The color of CMTS became yellowish by NH 3 treatment at 873 K, and the XRD peaks for N-CMTS remained unchanged from those for CMTS.No TaON or Ta 3 N 5 peaks were detected, as previously reported (Fig. S6, ESI ), 9 which indicates that N-doping of orthorhombic CMTS was successfully achieved.It was also confirmed that N-CMTS mostly retained the mesoporosity and morphology of CMTS, as determined by nitrogen adsorptiondesorption measurement and FE-SEM observation (Table 2 and Fig. S7,ESI ).The UV-vis diffuse reflection spectrum of N-CMTS shown in Fig. S8 (ESI ) indicates that no blue shift originated from the quantum size effect was observed compared to that of N-Ta 2 O 5 -fine.XPS analysis determined the nitrogen concentration to be 5.0 at (Table 2).Thus, N-CMTS consists of N-Ta 2 O 5 nanocrystals.In addition, both peaks around 400 and 396.6 eV were observed in the XPS spectra (Fig. S9,ESI ), which indicate that N-CMTS is a p-type semiconductor whose conduction band minimum (E CBM ) and valence band maximum (E VBM ) of N-CMTS are likely to be located at A1.3 V (vs.NHE) and 1.1 V, respectively, as we have recently confirmed. 9otocatalytic hydrogen evolution and CO 2 reduction under visible light irradiation using N-CMTS Photocatalytic H 2 evolution reactions of N-CMTS were performed in acetonitrile under visible light (410 nm) irradiation using triethanolamine (TEOA) as an electron donor and proton source and the results are summarized in Table 3. N-CMTS were found to be excellent visible light-sensitive photocatalysts and showed 2.1 times higher photocatalytic H 2 evolution activity than non-porous N-Ta 2 O 5 fine particles.The excellent photocatalytic activity of N-CMTS is considered to result from their morphology and their higher surface area.However, the advantage of the high surface area of N-CMTS is not fully exploited due to its lower crystallinity compared to that of N-Ta 2 O 5 -fine (Fig. S6, ESI ).The improvement of the crystallization process, such as the elongation of the thermal treatment time, would further enhance the photocatalytic activity of N-CMTS.In addition, the retention of the photocatalytic activity of N-CMTS even after 72 h of photoreaction is responsible for the stability of N-Ta 2 O 5 photocatalyst (Fig. S10, ESI ).Hybrid photocatalysts for CO 2 reduction consisting of a ruthenium complex and N-CMTS anchored by phosphonate (Ru-dpbpy-N-CMTS) were prepared by a direct assembly method (Fig. S11, ESI ), and the successful anchoring of Rudpbpy complex on N-CMTS was confirmed by ATR-FTIR spectroscopy, as previously reported for N-Ta 2 O 5 -fine.11 The Ru content of Ru-dpbpy-N-CMTS was determined by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) analysis.Although the maximum Ru content of the composite was 0.07 wt when non-mesoporous N-Ta 2 O 5 -fine was used as the semiconductor, this was increased to 0.12 wt for Ru-dpbpy-N-CMTS, which suggests that the larger surface area of N-CMTS enabled more incorporation of the Ru-dpbpy than N-Ta 2 O 5 -fine.The specific surface area and pore size of Ru-dpbpy-N-CMTS were measured by nitrogen adsorption-desorption after the incorporation of 0.12 wt Ru-dpbpy, and were found to have decreased from 86 m 2 g A1 and 6.8 nm to 70 m 2 g A1 and 6.4 nm, respectively (Fig. S12,ESI ), which indicates that Ru-dpbpy was successfully incorporated into the mesopores of nanocrystalline N-CMTS. Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with the hybrid photocatalysts was performed in MeCN/TEOA solution under visible light (410 nm) irradiation and the results are summarized in Table 3.For all hybrid samples containing the Ru-complex, the main photocatalytic reaction product from CO 2 was HCOOH. 10,32The mechanism of CO 2 reduction with this system was systematically analyzed.The visible light-excited electrons in the conduction band (CB) and the shallow defect levels in the bandgap of N-Ta 2 O 5 induced by the Ta 5f / N 2p transition are transferred to the Ru-complex catalyst within tens of picoseconds, and the transfer leads to the two-electron reduction of CO 2 to HCOOH. 12Comparison of Ru-dpbpy N-CMTS with Ru-dpbpy-N-Ta 2 O 5 -fine containing the same quantity of Ru (0.05 wt) showed that the amounts of HCOOH generated were similar, irrespective of the mesoporosity (4.7 and 4.4 mmol).This strongly suggests that photocatalytic CO 2 reduction occurs on Ru-dpbpy incorporated in the mesopores of N-CMTS.In the case of Ru-dpbpy-N-Ta 2 O 5 -fine with the highest Ru content (0.07 wt), the amount of HCOOH generated was very close to that of Ru-dpbpy-N-Ta 2 O 5 -fine with a lower Ru content (0.05 wt), which implies that the optimum amount of Ru-dpbpy for the Ru-dpbpy-N-Ta 2 O 5 -fine catalyst is approximately 0.05 wt.The limit of the Ru-dpbpy content is determined by the trade-off between the surface area necessary for simultaneous CO 2 reduction and TEOA oxidation to occur on N-Ta 2 O 5 .The coverage of Ru-dpbpy on Ru-dpbpy-N-Ta 2 O 5 -fine containing 0.05 wt Ru was estimated to be ca.16. In contrast, for Ru-dpbpy-N-CMTS containing 0.12 wt Ru, the amount of HCOOH generated was approximately 1.5 times higher than that for Ru-dpbpy-N-CMTS containing 0.05 wt Ru, which suggests that the Ru-complex incorporated into the mesopores of N-CMTS could be involved in the photocatalytic reaction.Although all of the Ru-complexes on N-CMTS were not involved in the catalytic reaction, the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to HCOOH was enhanced for N-CMTS over that for N-Ta 2 O 5 -fine.This is because the optimum loading amount of Ru-dpbpy, which is determined by the balance between the CO 2 reduction and TEOA oxidation, shifted to a higher value due to the higher surface area of N-CMTS.It has not yet been clarified if the submicron-sized spherical morphology of N-CMTS enhances the optical absorption due to light scattering.However, it is presumable that a porous semiconductor with large specific surface area composed of nanocrystals could be an excellent candidate for the photoactive framework of a hybrid photocatalyst for CO 2 reduction, because sufficient space is available for the incorporation of functional materials such as metal-complex catalysts, co-catalysts, and other semiconductor nanoparticles."}, {"llm generation": "N-CMTS", "source": "N-CMTS were found to be excellent visible light-sensitive photocatalysts and showed 2.1 times higher photocatalytic H 2 evolution activity than non-porous N-Ta 2 O 5 fine particles.", "context": "The synthesis of amorphous Ta 2 O 5 particles was conducted using a modified ligand-assisted templating method, in which a mixture of Ta(OEt) 5 -octadecylamine was hydrolyzed in a dilute water/ organic solvent.The method employed here is based on that employed for the synthesis of mesoporous silica, in which morphological control of the particles was achieved using a large amount of solvent for hydrolysis and condensation of the silica source. 30ig. 1 shows SEM images of Ta 2 O 5 particles obtained using various solvent compositions.The particles obtained in water consisted of many agglomerates greater than 1 mm in size comprised of Ta 2 O 5 fine particles, which suggests that the fine particles formed clump together due to the fast hydrolysis and condensation rate of the tantalum source (Fig. 1a).The result was similar to that for mesoporous Ta 2 O 5 particles obtained by the conventional ligand-assisted templating method (hereafter referred to as the conventional method), 26 which indicates that utilization of a large amount of water is not effective for morphological control.To overcome this tendency, a study was conducted in which co-solvent was added to water to control the hydrolysis and condensation rate of Ta(OEt) 5 .No significant change in the particle morphology was evident with 50 : 50 (w/w) water-methanol, compared with that of the particles obtained with the water system (Fig. 1b), while particles containing both spheres and irregular particles were obtained using a waterethylene glycol solvent system (Fig. 1c).Furthermore, when both methanol and ethylene glycol were used as co-solvents (watermethanol-ethylene glycol; 30 : 50 : 20, w/w/w), independent submicron-sized spherical particles were successfully obtained (Fig. 1d).Although the reason why the unique spherical Ta 2 O 5 particles were obtained with this solvent composition is not clear, it is considered that the addition of ethylene glycol with high viscosity affects the hydrolysis and condensation rate of the Ta source and the dispersibility of the formed particles. 31-ray diffraction patterns of the Ta 2 O 5 spheres obtained with the water-methanol-ethylene glycol co-solvent system were measured to investigate the regularity of the mesopores.Fig. S1 (ESI ) shows the XRD pattern with a diffraction peak around 2q 14 2 .The pattern is identical to that for a wormhole-like mesoporous structure obtained by the conventional method. 26he nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm of the MTS (Fig. S2,ESI ) is type IV, and the BET specific surface area and BJH pore diameter were determined to be 460 m 2 g A1 and 3.4 nm, respectively.These characteristics are similar to those of mesoporous Ta 2 O 5 obtained by the conventional method, 26 which indicates that this new methodology is capable of producing spherical mesoporous Ta 2 O 5 particles.In addition, wormholelike mesoporous structures of MTS were identified by TEM observation, which supports the XRD result (Fig. S3,ESI ).These results confirm that mesoporous Ta 2 O 5 spheres (MTS) were successfully prepared for the first time. Crystallized MTS (CMTS) were prepared by reinforcing MTS with carbon.Fig. 2 shows SEM and FE-SEM images of the resultant CMTS prepared under various conditions.The SEM image of CMTS heat-treated at 1073 K (CMTS-1073K) confirmed that the spherical morphology was mostly retained (Fig. 2a).FE-SEM observation showed that the CMTS consist of nanoparticles with particle sizes of ca. 10 nm (Fig. 2b).TEM observation of the corresponding sample (Fig. S4a,ESI ) also revealed that the wormhole-like mesostructure of MTS was lost during heat-treatment, while the nanoparticles were homogeneously dispersed in the submicron-sized spherical particles.This is in good agreement with the results from the FE-SEM image.The corresponding XRD pattern (Fig. 3b) has very broad peaks assignable to typical orthorhombic Ta 2 O 5 , which suggests the formation of Ta 2 O 5 nanocrystals.The crystallite size of CMTS-1073K was estimated to be 12.8 nm using the Scherrer equation (Table 1), which agrees well with that determined from the FE-SEM and TEM images. The FE-SEM images (Fig. 2b andc) show that heat-treatment conducted at a higher temperature (1173 K; CMTS-1173K) resulted in a larger nanocrystal size (ca.15 nm).The submicronsized spherical particle shape was mostly retained, even though aggregation of Ta 2 O 5 nanocrystals occurred during heat-treatment at higher than 1073 K.When heat-treatment was performed at 1073 K without carbon-filling (non-CMTS), the morphology of the particles was entirely changed and large primary particles with diameters in the range of 40-200 nm were obtained (Fig. 2d).This result strongly indicates that carbon plays an important role in retaining the spherical shape of the MTS and forming nanocrystals during crystallization.The structures of the CMTS are similar to monodispersed mesoporous tin oxide spheres (MMTOS) prepared using MSCS as a host 29 and these results indicate that this simple procedure of direct CMTS preparation using carbon reinforcement could be applicable to the direct crystallization of other mesoporous metal oxides. The XRD patterns shown in Fig. 3 indicate that the peaks for CMTS became larger and sharper with increased calcination temperature.Table 1 lists the crystallite size estimated using the Scherrer equation, which increased from 12.8 to 15.1 nm by increasing the temperature from 1073 to 1173 K.The small-angle peak at 2q 14 2 observed for amorphous MTS was absent in the XRD patterns for all heat-treated samples (data not shown), which suggests that the wormhole-like mesostructure of MTS was lost during crystallization. Fig. 4 shows nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms for CMTS, and the total pore volume, specific surface area, and average pore diameter calculated from the isotherms are listed in Table 1.All of the isotherms of the CMTS samples obtained by carbon-reinforcement are type IV curves (Fig. 4A(a-c)), which indicates a mesoporous structure, while non-CMTS obtained without carbon-filling exhibited poor nitrogen adsorption and thus no mesoporosity (Fig. 4A(d)).CMTS had a relatively high specific surface area (45-105 m 2 g A1 ) and mesopores with average diameters in the range of 5.6-17 nm (Table 1) after crystallization.TEM and XRD results confirmed that the Ta 2 O 5 nanocrystal size increased with temperature, resulting in larger pore diameter and smaller specific surface area.Therefore, the pore diameter of CMTS can be easily tunable by changing the crystallization temperature.During the calcination of the CMTScarbon composite, carbon was removed by combustion, generating interparticle nanospaces between the Ta 2 O 5 nanocrystals, so that submicron-sized CMTS with different pore sizes were successfully obtained. Ta 2 O 5 exhibits photocatalytic activity for H 2 evolution under UV irradiation (320 nm). 12319,9,25 To investigate the effect of the surface area and morphology of Ta 2 O 5 on photocatalytic activity, photocatalytic reactions of various CMTS samples and Ta 2 O 5 powder were performed in aqueous solutions containing methanol (20 vol), pre-purged with Ar gas under UV irradiation for 24 h.The results given in Table S1 (ESI ) suggest that the surface area, particle size and crystalline structure of Ta 2 O 5 have a significant effect on the photocatalytic activity for H 2 evolution and that CMTS is an excellent photocatalyst with the highest amount of H 2 evolution due to its controlled morphology and large surface area compared with other mesoporous or nonmesoporous Ta 2 O 5 particles that have been previously reported.The catalytic activity of the CMTS catalysts was dependent on the specific surface area, and CMTS-1073K with the highest surface area of 105 m 2 g A1 gave the highest amount of evolved H 2 . N-doping of CMTS was conducted to sensitize CMTS to visible light.CMTS-1073K, which had the highest photocatalytic H 2 evolution rate, was subjected to treatment with gaseous NH 3 .To date, the preparation of N-Ta 2 O 5 for photoenergy conversion has only been reported for N-doping of non-porous Ta 2 O 5 -fine. 91011 The particle size and specific surface area of Ta 2 O 5 -fine were 20-40 nm and 24 m 2 g A1 , respectively (Fig. S5b, ESI ).For comparison, N-doping of Ta 2 O 5 -fine (N-Ta 2 O 5 -fine) was also conducted and the morphological properties are summarized in Table 2.The color of CMTS became yellowish by NH 3 treatment at 873 K, and the XRD peaks for N-CMTS remained unchanged from those for CMTS.No TaON or Ta 3 N 5 peaks were detected, as previously reported (Fig. S6, ESI ), 9 which indicates that N-doping of orthorhombic CMTS was successfully achieved.It was also confirmed that N-CMTS mostly retained the mesoporosity and morphology of CMTS, as determined by nitrogen adsorptiondesorption measurement and FE-SEM observation (Table 2 and Fig. S7,ESI ).The UV-vis diffuse reflection spectrum of N-CMTS shown in Fig. S8 (ESI ) indicates that no blue shift originated from the quantum size effect was observed compared to that of N-Ta 2 O 5 -fine.XPS analysis determined the nitrogen concentration to be 5.0 at (Table 2).Thus, N-CMTS consists of N-Ta 2 O 5 nanocrystals.In addition, both peaks around 400 and 396.6 eV were observed in the XPS spectra (Fig. S9,ESI ), which indicate that N-CMTS is a p-type semiconductor whose conduction band minimum (E CBM ) and valence band maximum (E VBM ) of N-CMTS are likely to be located at A1.3 V (vs.NHE) and 1.1 V, respectively, as we have recently confirmed. 9otocatalytic hydrogen evolution and CO 2 reduction under visible light irradiation using N-CMTS Photocatalytic H 2 evolution reactions of N-CMTS were performed in acetonitrile under visible light (410 nm) irradiation using triethanolamine (TEOA) as an electron donor and proton source and the results are summarized in Table 3.

Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with the hybrid photocatalysts was performed in MeCN/TEOA solution under visible light (410 nm) irradiation and the results are summarized in Table 3.For all hybrid samples containing the Ru-complex, the main photocatalytic reaction product from CO 2 was HCOOH. 10,32The mechanism of CO 2 reduction with this system was systematically analyzed.The visible light-excited electrons in the conduction band (CB) and the shallow defect levels in the bandgap of N-Ta 2 O 5 induced by the Ta 5f / N 2p transition are transferred to the Ru-complex catalyst within tens of picoseconds, and the transfer leads to the two-electron reduction of CO 2 to HCOOH. 12Comparison of Ru-dpbpy N-CMTS with Ru-dpbpy-N-Ta 2 O 5 -fine containing the same quantity of Ru (0.05 wt) showed that the amounts of HCOOH generated were similar, irrespective of the mesoporosity (4.7 and 4.4 mmol).This strongly suggests that photocatalytic CO 2 reduction occurs on Ru-dpbpy incorporated in the mesopores of N-CMTS.In the case of Ru-dpbpy-N-Ta 2 O 5 -fine with the highest Ru content (0.07 wt), the amount of HCOOH generated was very close to that of Ru-dpbpy-N-Ta 2 O 5 -fine with a lower Ru content (0.05 wt), which implies that the optimum amount of Ru-dpbpy for the Ru-dpbpy-N-Ta 2 O 5 -fine catalyst is approximately 0.05 wt.The limit of the Ru-dpbpy content is determined by the trade-off between the surface area necessary for simultaneous CO 2 reduction and TEOA oxidation to occur on N-Ta 2 O 5 .The coverage of Ru-dpbpy on Ru-dpbpy-N-Ta 2 O 5 -fine containing 0.05 wt Ru was estimated to be ca.16. In contrast, for Ru-dpbpy-N-CMTS containing 0.12 wt Ru, the amount of HCOOH generated was approximately 1.5 times higher than that for Ru-dpbpy-N-CMTS containing 0.05 wt Ru, which suggests that the Ru-complex incorporated into the mesopores of N-CMTS could be involved in the photocatalytic reaction.Although all of the Ru-complexes on N-CMTS were not involved in the catalytic reaction, the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to HCOOH was enhanced for N-CMTS over that for N-Ta 2 O 5 -fine.This is because the optimum loading amount of Ru-dpbpy, which is determined by the balance between the CO 2 reduction and TEOA oxidation, shifted to a higher value due to the higher surface area of N-CMTS.It has not yet been clarified if the submicron-sized spherical morphology of N-CMTS enhances the optical absorption due to light scattering.However, it is presumable that a porous semiconductor with large specific surface area composed of nanocrystals could be an excellent candidate for the photoactive framework of a hybrid photocatalyst for CO 2 reduction, because sufficient space is available for the incorporation of functional materials such as metal-complex catalysts, co-catalysts, and other semiconductor nanoparticles."}, {"llm generation": "N-Ta 2 O 5 photocatalyst", "source": "In addition, the retention of the photocatalytic activity of N-CMTS even after 72 h of photoreaction is responsible for the stability of N-Ta 2 O 5 photocatalyst (Fig. S10, ESI ).", "context": "The synthesis of amorphous Ta 2 O 5 particles was conducted using a modified ligand-assisted templating method, in which a mixture of Ta(OEt) 5 -octadecylamine was hydrolyzed in a dilute water/ organic solvent.The method employed here is based on that employed for the synthesis of mesoporous silica, in which morphological control of the particles was achieved using a large amount of solvent for hydrolysis and condensation of the silica source. 30ig. 1 shows SEM images of Ta 2 O 5 particles obtained using various solvent compositions.The particles obtained in water consisted of many agglomerates greater than 1 mm in size comprised of Ta 2 O 5 fine particles, which suggests that the fine particles formed clump together due to the fast hydrolysis and condensation rate of the tantalum source (Fig. 1a).The result was similar to that for mesoporous Ta 2 O 5 particles obtained by the conventional ligand-assisted templating method (hereafter referred to as the conventional method), 26 which indicates that utilization of a large amount of water is not effective for morphological control.To overcome this tendency, a study was conducted in which co-solvent was added to water to control the hydrolysis and condensation rate of Ta(OEt) 5 .No significant change in the particle morphology was evident with 50 : 50 (w/w) water-methanol, compared with that of the particles obtained with the water system (Fig. 1b), while particles containing both spheres and irregular particles were obtained using a waterethylene glycol solvent system (Fig. 1c).Furthermore, when both methanol and ethylene glycol were used as co-solvents (watermethanol-ethylene glycol; 30 : 50 : 20, w/w/w), independent submicron-sized spherical particles were successfully obtained (Fig. 1d).Although the reason why the unique spherical Ta 2 O 5 particles were obtained with this solvent composition is not clear, it is considered that the addition of ethylene glycol with high viscosity affects the hydrolysis and condensation rate of the Ta source and the dispersibility of the formed particles. 31-ray diffraction patterns of the Ta 2 O 5 spheres obtained with the water-methanol-ethylene glycol co-solvent system were measured to investigate the regularity of the mesopores.Fig. S1 (ESI ) shows the XRD pattern with a diffraction peak around 2q 14 2 .The pattern is identical to that for a wormhole-like mesoporous structure obtained by the conventional method. 26he nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm of the MTS (Fig. S2,ESI ) is type IV, and the BET specific surface area and BJH pore diameter were determined to be 460 m 2 g A1 and 3.4 nm, respectively.These characteristics are similar to those of mesoporous Ta 2 O 5 obtained by the conventional method, 26 which indicates that this new methodology is capable of producing spherical mesoporous Ta 2 O 5 particles.In addition, wormholelike mesoporous structures of MTS were identified by TEM observation, which supports the XRD result (Fig. S3,ESI ).These results confirm that mesoporous Ta 2 O 5 spheres (MTS) were successfully prepared for the first time.

Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with the hybrid photocatalysts was performed in MeCN/TEOA solution under visible light (410 nm) irradiation and the results are summarized in Table 3.For all hybrid samples containing the Ru-complex, the main photocatalytic reaction product from CO 2 was HCOOH. 10,32The mechanism of CO 2 reduction with this system was systematically analyzed.The visible light-excited electrons in the conduction band (CB) and the shallow defect levels in the bandgap of N-Ta 2 O 5 induced by the Ta 5f / N 2p transition are transferred to the Ru-complex catalyst within tens of picoseconds, and the transfer leads to the two-electron reduction of CO 2 to HCOOH. 12Comparison of Ru-dpbpy N-CMTS with Ru-dpbpy-N-Ta 2 O 5 -fine containing the same quantity of Ru (0.05 wt) showed that the amounts of HCOOH generated were similar, irrespective of the mesoporosity (4.7 and 4.4 mmol).This strongly suggests that photocatalytic CO 2 reduction occurs on Ru-dpbpy incorporated in the mesopores of N-CMTS.In the case of Ru-dpbpy-N-Ta 2 O 5 -fine with the highest Ru content (0.07 wt), the amount of HCOOH generated was very close to that of Ru-dpbpy-N-Ta 2 O 5 -fine with a lower Ru content (0.05 wt), which implies that the optimum amount of Ru-dpbpy for the Ru-dpbpy-N-Ta 2 O 5 -fine catalyst is approximately 0.05 wt.The limit of the Ru-dpbpy content is determined by the trade-off between the surface area necessary for simultaneous CO 2 reduction and TEOA oxidation to occur on N-Ta 2 O 5 .The coverage of Ru-dpbpy on Ru-dpbpy-N-Ta 2 O 5 -fine containing 0.05 wt Ru was estimated to be ca.16. In contrast, for Ru-dpbpy-N-CMTS containing 0.12 wt Ru, the amount of HCOOH generated was approximately 1.5 times higher than that for Ru-dpbpy-N-CMTS containing 0.05 wt Ru, which suggests that the Ru-complex incorporated into the mesopores of N-CMTS could be involved in the photocatalytic reaction.Although all of the Ru-complexes on N-CMTS were not involved in the catalytic reaction, the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to HCOOH was enhanced for N-CMTS over that for N-Ta 2 O 5 -fine.This is because the optimum loading amount of Ru-dpbpy, which is determined by the balance between the CO 2 reduction and TEOA oxidation, shifted to a higher value due to the higher surface area of N-CMTS.It has not yet been clarified if the submicron-sized spherical morphology of N-CMTS enhances the optical absorption due to light scattering.However, it is presumable that a porous semiconductor with large specific surface area composed of nanocrystals could be an excellent candidate for the photoactive framework of a hybrid photocatalyst for CO 2 reduction, because sufficient space is available for the incorporation of functional materials such as metal-complex catalysts, co-catalysts, and other semiconductor nanoparticles."}, {"llm generation": "ruthenium complex and N-CMTS", "source": "Hybrid photocatalysts for CO 2 reduction consisting of a ruthenium complex and N-CMTS anchored by phosphonate (Ru-dpbpy-N-CMTS) were prepared by a direct assembly method (Fig. S11, ESI ), and the successful anchoring of Rudpbpy complex on N-CMTS was confirmed by ATR-FTIR spectroscopy, as previously reported for N-Ta 2 O 5 -fine.", "context": "The synthesis of amorphous Ta 2 O 5 particles was conducted using a modified ligand-assisted templating method, in which a mixture of Ta(OEt) 5 -octadecylamine was hydrolyzed in a dilute water/ organic solvent.The method employed here is based on that employed for the synthesis of mesoporous silica, in which morphological control of the particles was achieved using a large amount of solvent for hydrolysis and condensation of the silica source. 30ig. 1 shows SEM images of Ta 2 O 5 particles obtained using various solvent compositions.The particles obtained in water consisted of many agglomerates greater than 1 mm in size comprised of Ta 2 O 5 fine particles, which suggests that the fine particles formed clump together due to the fast hydrolysis and condensation rate of the tantalum source (Fig. 1a).The result was similar to that for mesoporous Ta 2 O 5 particles obtained by the conventional ligand-assisted templating method (hereafter referred to as the conventional method), 26 which indicates that utilization of a large amount of water is not effective for morphological control.To overcome this tendency, a study was conducted in which co-solvent was added to water to control the hydrolysis and condensation rate of Ta(OEt) 5 .No significant change in the particle morphology was evident with 50 : 50 (w/w) water-methanol, compared with that of the particles obtained with the water system (Fig. 1b), while particles containing both spheres and irregular particles were obtained using a waterethylene glycol solvent system (Fig. 1c).Furthermore, when both methanol and ethylene glycol were used as co-solvents (watermethanol-ethylene glycol; 30 : 50 : 20, w/w/w), independent submicron-sized spherical particles were successfully obtained (Fig. 1d).Although the reason why the unique spherical Ta 2 O 5 particles were obtained with this solvent composition is not clear, it is considered that the addition of ethylene glycol with high viscosity affects the hydrolysis and condensation rate of the Ta source and the dispersibility of the formed particles. 31-ray diffraction patterns of the Ta 2 O 5 spheres obtained with the water-methanol-ethylene glycol co-solvent system were measured to investigate the regularity of the mesopores.Fig. S1 (ESI ) shows the XRD pattern with a diffraction peak around 2q 14 2 .The pattern is identical to that for a wormhole-like mesoporous structure obtained by the conventional method. 26he nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm of the MTS (Fig. S2,ESI ) is type IV, and the BET specific surface area and BJH pore diameter were determined to be 460 m 2 g A1 and 3.4 nm, respectively.These characteristics are similar to those of mesoporous Ta 2 O 5 obtained by the conventional method, 26 which indicates that this new methodology is capable of producing spherical mesoporous Ta 2 O 5 particles.In addition, wormholelike mesoporous structures of MTS were identified by TEM observation, which supports the XRD result (Fig. S3,ESI ).These results confirm that mesoporous Ta 2 O 5 spheres (MTS) were successfully prepared for the first time. Crystallized MTS (CMTS) were prepared by reinforcing MTS with carbon.Fig. 2 shows SEM and FE-SEM images of the resultant CMTS prepared under various conditions.The SEM image of CMTS heat-treated at 1073 K (CMTS-1073K) confirmed that the spherical morphology was mostly retained (Fig. 2a).FE-SEM observation showed that the CMTS consist of nanoparticles with particle sizes of ca. 10 nm (Fig. 2b).TEM observation of the corresponding sample (Fig. S4a,ESI ) also revealed that the wormhole-like mesostructure of MTS was lost during heat-treatment, while the nanoparticles were homogeneously dispersed in the submicron-sized spherical particles.This is in good agreement with the results from the FE-SEM image.The corresponding XRD pattern (Fig. 3b) has very broad peaks assignable to typical orthorhombic Ta 2 O 5 , which suggests the formation of Ta 2 O 5 nanocrystals.The crystallite size of CMTS-1073K was estimated to be 12.8 nm using the Scherrer equation (Table 1), which agrees well with that determined from the FE-SEM and TEM images. The FE-SEM images (Fig. 2b andc) show that heat-treatment conducted at a higher temperature (1173 K; CMTS-1173K) resulted in a larger nanocrystal size (ca.15 nm).The submicronsized spherical particle shape was mostly retained, even though aggregation of Ta 2 O 5 nanocrystals occurred during heat-treatment at higher than 1073 K.When heat-treatment was performed at 1073 K without carbon-filling (non-CMTS), the morphology of the particles was entirely changed and large primary particles with diameters in the range of 40-200 nm were obtained (Fig. 2d).This result strongly indicates that carbon plays an important role in retaining the spherical shape of the MTS and forming nanocrystals during crystallization.The structures of the CMTS are similar to monodispersed mesoporous tin oxide spheres (MMTOS) prepared using MSCS as a host 29 and these results indicate that this simple procedure of direct CMTS preparation using carbon reinforcement could be applicable to the direct crystallization of other mesoporous metal oxides. The XRD patterns shown in Fig. 3 indicate that the peaks for CMTS became larger and sharper with increased calcination temperature.Table 1 lists the crystallite size estimated using the Scherrer equation, which increased from 12.8 to 15.1 nm by increasing the temperature from 1073 to 1173 K.The small-angle peak at 2q 14 2 observed for amorphous MTS was absent in the XRD patterns for all heat-treated samples (data not shown), which suggests that the wormhole-like mesostructure of MTS was lost during crystallization. Fig. 4 shows nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms for CMTS, and the total pore volume, specific surface area, and average pore diameter calculated from the isotherms are listed in Table 1.All of the isotherms of the CMTS samples obtained by carbon-reinforcement are type IV curves (Fig. 4A(a-c)), which indicates a mesoporous structure, while non-CMTS obtained without carbon-filling exhibited poor nitrogen adsorption and thus no mesoporosity (Fig. 4A(d)).CMTS had a relatively high specific surface area (45-105 m 2 g A1 ) and mesopores with average diameters in the range of 5.6-17 nm (Table 1) after crystallization.TEM and XRD results confirmed that the Ta 2 O 5 nanocrystal size increased with temperature, resulting in larger pore diameter and smaller specific surface area.Therefore, the pore diameter of CMTS can be easily tunable by changing the crystallization temperature.During the calcination of the CMTScarbon composite, carbon was removed by combustion, generating interparticle nanospaces between the Ta 2 O 5 nanocrystals, so that submicron-sized CMTS with different pore sizes were successfully obtained. Ta 2 O 5 exhibits photocatalytic activity for H 2 evolution under UV irradiation (320 nm). 12319,9,25 To investigate the effect of the surface area and morphology of Ta 2 O 5 on photocatalytic activity, photocatalytic reactions of various CMTS samples and Ta 2 O 5 powder were performed in aqueous solutions containing methanol (20 vol), pre-purged with Ar gas under UV irradiation for 24 h.The results given in Table S1 (ESI ) suggest that the surface area, particle size and crystalline structure of Ta 2 O 5 have a significant effect on the photocatalytic activity for H 2 evolution and that CMTS is an excellent photocatalyst with the highest amount of H 2 evolution due to its controlled morphology and large surface area compared with other mesoporous or nonmesoporous Ta 2 O 5 particles that have been previously reported.The catalytic activity of the CMTS catalysts was dependent on the specific surface area, and CMTS-1073K with the highest surface area of 105 m 2 g A1 gave the highest amount of evolved H 2 . N-doping of CMTS was conducted to sensitize CMTS to visible light.CMTS-1073K, which had the highest photocatalytic H 2 evolution rate, was subjected to treatment with gaseous NH 3 .To date, the preparation of N-Ta 2 O 5 for photoenergy conversion has only been reported for N-doping of non-porous Ta 2 O 5 -fine. 91011 The particle size and specific surface area of Ta 2 O 5 -fine were 20-40 nm and 24 m 2 g A1 , respectively (Fig. S5b, ESI ).For comparison, N-doping of Ta 2 O 5 -fine (N-Ta 2 O 5 -fine) was also conducted and the morphological properties are summarized in Table 2.The color of CMTS became yellowish by NH 3 treatment at 873 K, and the XRD peaks for N-CMTS remained unchanged from those for CMTS.No TaON or Ta 3 N 5 peaks were detected, as previously reported (Fig. S6, ESI ), 9 which indicates that N-doping of orthorhombic CMTS was successfully achieved.It was also confirmed that N-CMTS mostly retained the mesoporosity and morphology of CMTS, as determined by nitrogen adsorptiondesorption measurement and FE-SEM observation (Table 2 and Fig. S7,ESI ).The UV-vis diffuse reflection spectrum of N-CMTS shown in Fig. S8 (ESI ) indicates that no blue shift originated from the quantum size effect was observed compared to that of N-Ta 2 O 5 -fine.XPS analysis determined the nitrogen concentration to be 5.0 at (Table 2).Thus, N-CMTS consists of N-Ta 2 O 5 nanocrystals.In addition, both peaks around 400 and 396.6 eV were observed in the XPS spectra (Fig. S9,ESI ), which indicate that N-CMTS is a p-type semiconductor whose conduction band minimum (E CBM ) and valence band maximum (E VBM ) of N-CMTS are likely to be located at A1.3 V (vs.NHE) and 1.1 V, respectively, as we have recently confirmed. 9otocatalytic hydrogen evolution and CO 2 reduction under visible light irradiation using N-CMTS Photocatalytic H 2 evolution reactions of N-CMTS were performed in acetonitrile under visible light (410 nm) irradiation using triethanolamine (TEOA) as an electron donor and proton source and the results are summarized in Table 3.

N-doping of CMTS was conducted to sensitize CMTS to visible light.CMTS-1073K, which had the highest photocatalytic H 2 evolution rate, was subjected to treatment with gaseous NH 3 .To date, the preparation of N-Ta 2 O 5 for photoenergy conversion has only been reported for N-doping of non-porous Ta 2 O 5 -fine. 91011 The particle size and specific surface area of Ta 2 O 5 -fine were 20-40 nm and 24 m 2 g A1 , respectively (Fig. S5b, ESI ).For comparison, N-doping of Ta 2 O 5 -fine (N-Ta 2 O 5 -fine) was also conducted and the morphological properties are summarized in Table 2.The color of CMTS became yellowish by NH 3 treatment at 873 K, and the XRD peaks for N-CMTS remained unchanged from those for CMTS.No TaON or Ta 3 N 5 peaks were detected, as previously reported (Fig. S6, ESI ), 9 which indicates that N-doping of orthorhombic CMTS was successfully achieved.It was also confirmed that N-CMTS mostly retained the mesoporosity and morphology of CMTS, as determined by nitrogen adsorptiondesorption measurement and FE-SEM observation (Table 2 and Fig. S7,ESI ).The UV-vis diffuse reflection spectrum of N-CMTS shown in Fig. S8 (ESI ) indicates that no blue shift originated from the quantum size effect was observed compared to that of N-Ta 2 O 5 -fine.XPS analysis determined the nitrogen concentration to be 5.0 at (Table 2).Thus, N-CMTS consists of N-Ta 2 O 5 nanocrystals.In addition, both peaks around 400 and 396.6 eV were observed in the XPS spectra (Fig. S9,ESI ), which indicate that N-CMTS is a p-type semiconductor whose conduction band minimum (E CBM ) and valence band maximum (E VBM ) of N-CMTS are likely to be located at A1.3 V (vs.NHE) and 1.1 V, respectively, as we have recently confirmed. 9otocatalytic hydrogen evolution and CO 2 reduction under visible light irradiation using N-CMTS Photocatalytic H 2 evolution reactions of N-CMTS were performed in acetonitrile under visible light (410 nm) irradiation using triethanolamine (TEOA) as an electron donor and proton source and the results are summarized in Table 3. N-CMTS were found to be excellent visible light-sensitive photocatalysts and showed 2.1 times higher photocatalytic H 2 evolution activity than non-porous N-Ta 2 O 5 fine particles.The excellent photocatalytic activity of N-CMTS is considered to result from their morphology and their higher surface area.However, the advantage of the high surface area of N-CMTS is not fully exploited due to its lower crystallinity compared to that of N-Ta 2 O 5 -fine (Fig. S6, ESI ).The improvement of the crystallization process, such as the elongation of the thermal treatment time, would further enhance the photocatalytic activity of N-CMTS.In addition, the retention of the photocatalytic activity of N-CMTS even after 72 h of photoreaction is responsible for the stability of N-Ta 2 O 5 photocatalyst (Fig. S10, ESI ).Hybrid photocatalysts for CO 2 reduction consisting of a ruthenium complex and N-CMTS anchored by phosphonate (Ru-dpbpy-N-CMTS) were prepared by a direct assembly method (Fig. S11, ESI ), and the successful anchoring of Rudpbpy complex on N-CMTS was confirmed by ATR-FTIR spectroscopy, as previously reported for N-Ta 2 O 5 -fine.11 The Ru content of Ru-dpbpy-N-CMTS was determined by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) analysis.Although the maximum Ru content of the composite was 0.07 wt when non-mesoporous N-Ta 2 O 5 -fine was used as the semiconductor, this was increased to 0.12 wt for Ru-dpbpy-N-CMTS, which suggests that the larger surface area of N-CMTS enabled more incorporation of the Ru-dpbpy than N-Ta 2 O 5 -fine.The specific surface area and pore size of Ru-dpbpy-N-CMTS were measured by nitrogen adsorption-desorption after the incorporation of 0.12 wt Ru-dpbpy, and were found to have decreased from 86 m 2 g A1 and 6.8 nm to 70 m 2 g A1 and 6.4 nm, respectively (Fig. S12,ESI ), which indicates that Ru-dpbpy was successfully incorporated into the mesopores of nanocrystalline N-CMTS. Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with the hybrid photocatalysts was performed in MeCN/TEOA solution under visible light (410 nm) irradiation and the results are summarized in Table 3.For all hybrid samples containing the Ru-complex, the main photocatalytic reaction product from CO 2 was HCOOH. 10,32The mechanism of CO 2 reduction with this system was systematically analyzed.The visible light-excited electrons in the conduction band (CB) and the shallow defect levels in the bandgap of N-Ta 2 O 5 induced by the Ta 5f / N 2p transition are transferred to the Ru-complex catalyst within tens of picoseconds, and the transfer leads to the two-electron reduction of CO 2 to HCOOH. 12Comparison of Ru-dpbpy N-CMTS with Ru-dpbpy-N-Ta 2 O 5 -fine containing the same quantity of Ru (0.05 wt) showed that the amounts of HCOOH generated were similar, irrespective of the mesoporosity (4.7 and 4.4 mmol).This strongly suggests that photocatalytic CO 2 reduction occurs on Ru-dpbpy incorporated in the mesopores of N-CMTS.In the case of Ru-dpbpy-N-Ta 2 O 5 -fine with the highest Ru content (0.07 wt), the amount of HCOOH generated was very close to that of Ru-dpbpy-N-Ta 2 O 5 -fine with a lower Ru content (0.05 wt), which implies that the optimum amount of Ru-dpbpy for the Ru-dpbpy-N-Ta 2 O 5 -fine catalyst is approximately 0.05 wt.The limit of the Ru-dpbpy content is determined by the trade-off between the surface area necessary for simultaneous CO 2 reduction and TEOA oxidation to occur on N-Ta 2 O 5 .The coverage of Ru-dpbpy on Ru-dpbpy-N-Ta 2 O 5 -fine containing 0.05 wt Ru was estimated to be ca.16. In contrast, for Ru-dpbpy-N-CMTS containing 0.12 wt Ru, the amount of HCOOH generated was approximately 1.5 times higher than that for Ru-dpbpy-N-CMTS containing 0.05 wt Ru, which suggests that the Ru-complex incorporated into the mesopores of N-CMTS could be involved in the photocatalytic reaction.Although all of the Ru-complexes on N-CMTS were not involved in the catalytic reaction, the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to HCOOH was enhanced for N-CMTS over that for N-Ta 2 O 5 -fine.This is because the optimum loading amount of Ru-dpbpy, which is determined by the balance between the CO 2 reduction and TEOA oxidation, shifted to a higher value due to the higher surface area of N-CMTS.It has not yet been clarified if the submicron-sized spherical morphology of N-CMTS enhances the optical absorption due to light scattering.However, it is presumable that a porous semiconductor with large specific surface area composed of nanocrystals could be an excellent candidate for the photoactive framework of a hybrid photocatalyst for CO 2 reduction, because sufficient space is available for the incorporation of functional materials such as metal-complex catalysts, co-catalysts, and other semiconductor nanoparticles."}, {"llm generation": "N-CMTS", "source": "Photocatalytic activities for H 2 evolution and CO 2 reduction of N-CMTS and N-Ta 2 O 5 -fine photocatalysts without and with Ru-complex under visible light irradiation (410 l 750 nm) Sample H 2 photoevolution CO 2 photoreduction (with Ru-complex Ru-dpbpy a ) Ru(dpbpy)(bpy)(CO) 2 2 (dpbpy: 4,4 0 -diphosphonate-2,2 0 -bipyridine, bpy: 2,2 0 -bipyridine).b Estimated by ICP analysis.", "context": "Control of the composition and amount of solvent during the hydrolysis and condensation of the Ta-source led to the successful synthesis of submicron-sized amorphous MTS.CMTS composed of Ta 2 O 5 nanocrystals was prepared by reinforcing MTS with carbon followed by heat-treatment.The mesopore diameter of CMTS could easily be adjusted by changing the crystallization temperature.CMTS were found to be an excellent photocatalyst for hydrogen evolution, due to their controlled morphology and large surface area.Visible light-sensitive N-CMTS was obtained by the nitridation of CMTS.N-CMTS exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution, and selective photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction using a hybrid catalyst system with a metal-complex.This confirmed that a mesoporous p-type semiconductor was generated, which would be beneficial for future solar conversion technology.The proposed synthesis methodology is simple and versatile and can be extended to the preparation of other types of crystallized mesoporous spherical semiconductors.In addition, it is considered that the unique architecture of the proposed catalyst can be widely applied to high-efficiency photocatalysis for solar energy conversion and solar fuel generation.

(Japan).Methanol, ethylene glycol, furfuryl alcohol, and dehydrated acetonitrile (MeCN) were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Co.(Japan). A typical synthesis of MTS employs a modified ligand-assisted templating method, 23,26 as follows.Octadecylamine (6.15 mmol) and Ta(OEt) 5 (12.3 mmol) were dissolved in methanol.The mixture of octadecylamine-Ta(OEt) 5 was then added to 1000 g of a water/organic solvent solution with vigorous stirring at 298 K.After 5 h of continuous stirring, the resulting white powder was then filtered and the Ta 2 O 5 -surfactant composite was added to 25 mL of water in a Teflon-lined autoclave.The autoclave was sealed and placed in an oven and heated at 353 K for 1 day, 373 K for 1 day, and then 453 K for 7 days.The resulting powder was filtered and washed twice with a water/ ethanol solution and then dried. 1 g of this powder was heated in 100 mL of ethanol solution containing 1 mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid at 333 K for 3 h to remove the surfactant.The resultant powder was filtered, washed several times with ethanol, and dried at 318 K. Furfuryl alcohol was used as a carbon source.First, the mesopores of MTS were filled with furfuryl alcohol until incipient wetness was achieved.The impregnated sample was then heated at 423 K for 24 h in air to polymerize the furfuryl alcohol, with subsequent carbonization accompanied by crystallization of Ta 2 O 5 at 1073-1173 K for 1 h under a nitrogen atmosphere.Calcination of the carbon-CMTS composite was carried out at 823 K for 5 h in air to remove the carbon and yield crystallized MTS (CMTS).N-CMTS was prepared by annealing CMTS under an NH 3 flow at 848 K for 6 h. Hybrid photocatalysts consisting of a ruthenium complex Ru(dpbpy)(bpy)(CO) 2 2 (abbreviated as Ru-dpbpy; dpbpy: 4,4 0 -diphosphonate-2,2 0 -bipyridine; bpy: 2,2 0 -bipyridine) and N-CMTS were synthesized using a previously reported direct assembly method. 11eparation of fine Ta 2 O 5 (Ta 2 O 5 -fine) and fine N-doped Ta 2 O 5 (N-Ta 2 O 5 -fine) particles Ta 2 O 5 -fine was prepared using TaCl 5 and ammonia solution as previously reported. 9N-Ta 2 O 5 -fine was prepared by annealing Ta 2 O 5 -fine under an NH 3 flow at 848 K for 6 h, according to a previously reported method. 91011 Characterization Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were conducted using a Rigaku Rint-TTR X-ray diffractometer with Cu Ka radiation.Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed using a SIGMA-V (Akashi Seisakusho) microscope and a field emission-SEM (FE-SEM; S-5500, Hitachi) microscope.Nitrogen adsorption isotherms were measured using a Belsorp-mini II (BEL Japan) at 77 K, where the samples were evacuated at less than 10 A3 mm Hg at 373 K prior to measurements.The pore diameter was calculated using the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method.After considering the linearity of a Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) plot, the specific surface area was calculated using adsorption data in the P/P 0 range from 0.05 to 0.13.Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was conducted using a 200CX TEM (Jeol) microscope at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV.The N 1s and O 1s core levels were measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS; Quantera SXM, Ulvac-Phi) with monochromated Al Ka radiation to determine the N states and N-doping concentrations.The chemical structures of the composites were characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR; VERTEX 80, Bruker Optics) spectroscopy combined with an attenuated total reflectance (ATR) accessory (Dura Sample IR, Smiths Detection).The Ru content in the samples was determined by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) analysis (CIROS 120 EOP, Rigaku). Photocatalytic activity was measured at ambient pressure in 8 mL test tubes containing 4 mL of dehydrated acetonitrile (MeCN)-triethanolamine (TEOA) (5/1 14 v/v) and 10 mg of photocatalyst.After purging with Ar (for hydrogen evolution) or CO 2 (for CO 2 reduction) for 15 min, the solutions were irradiated using a 500 W Xe lamp with filters to produce light in the range 410 l 750 nm for 24 h at room temperature, as reported previously. 10Product concentrations were determined by gas chromatography (GC-14A, Shimadzu) and ion-exchange chromatography (ICS-2000, Dionex)."}, {"llm generation": "visible light (410 nm) irradiation", "source": "Photocatalytic H 2 evolution reactions of N-CMTS were performed in acetonitrile under visible light (410 nm) irradiation using triethanolamine (TEOA) as an electron donor and proton source and the results are summarized in Table 3.", "context": "The synthesis of amorphous Ta 2 O 5 particles was conducted using a modified ligand-assisted templating method, in which a mixture of Ta(OEt) 5 -octadecylamine was hydrolyzed in a dilute water/ organic solvent.The method employed here is based on that employed for the synthesis of mesoporous silica, in which morphological control of the particles was achieved using a large amount of solvent for hydrolysis and condensation of the silica source. 30ig. 1 shows SEM images of Ta 2 O 5 particles obtained using various solvent compositions.The particles obtained in water consisted of many agglomerates greater than 1 mm in size comprised of Ta 2 O 5 fine particles, which suggests that the fine particles formed clump together due to the fast hydrolysis and condensation rate of the tantalum source (Fig. 1a).The result was similar to that for mesoporous Ta 2 O 5 particles obtained by the conventional ligand-assisted templating method (hereafter referred to as the conventional method), 26 which indicates that utilization of a large amount of water is not effective for morphological control.To overcome this tendency, a study was conducted in which co-solvent was added to water to control the hydrolysis and condensation rate of Ta(OEt) 5 .No significant change in the particle morphology was evident with 50 : 50 (w/w) water-methanol, compared with that of the particles obtained with the water system (Fig. 1b), while particles containing both spheres and irregular particles were obtained using a waterethylene glycol solvent system (Fig. 1c).Furthermore, when both methanol and ethylene glycol were used as co-solvents (watermethanol-ethylene glycol; 30 : 50 : 20, w/w/w), independent submicron-sized spherical particles were successfully obtained (Fig. 1d).Although the reason why the unique spherical Ta 2 O 5 particles were obtained with this solvent composition is not clear, it is considered that the addition of ethylene glycol with high viscosity affects the hydrolysis and condensation rate of the Ta source and the dispersibility of the formed particles. 31-ray diffraction patterns of the Ta 2 O 5 spheres obtained with the water-methanol-ethylene glycol co-solvent system were measured to investigate the regularity of the mesopores.Fig. S1 (ESI ) shows the XRD pattern with a diffraction peak around 2q 14 2 .The pattern is identical to that for a wormhole-like mesoporous structure obtained by the conventional method. 26he nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm of the MTS (Fig. S2,ESI ) is type IV, and the BET specific surface area and BJH pore diameter were determined to be 460 m 2 g A1 and 3.4 nm, respectively.These characteristics are similar to those of mesoporous Ta 2 O 5 obtained by the conventional method, 26 which indicates that this new methodology is capable of producing spherical mesoporous Ta 2 O 5 particles.In addition, wormholelike mesoporous structures of MTS were identified by TEM observation, which supports the XRD result (Fig. S3,ESI ).These results confirm that mesoporous Ta 2 O 5 spheres (MTS) were successfully prepared for the first time. Crystallized MTS (CMTS) were prepared by reinforcing MTS with carbon.Fig. 2 shows SEM and FE-SEM images of the resultant CMTS prepared under various conditions.The SEM image of CMTS heat-treated at 1073 K (CMTS-1073K) confirmed that the spherical morphology was mostly retained (Fig. 2a).FE-SEM observation showed that the CMTS consist of nanoparticles with particle sizes of ca. 10 nm (Fig. 2b).TEM observation of the corresponding sample (Fig. S4a,ESI ) also revealed that the wormhole-like mesostructure of MTS was lost during heat-treatment, while the nanoparticles were homogeneously dispersed in the submicron-sized spherical particles.This is in good agreement with the results from the FE-SEM image.The corresponding XRD pattern (Fig. 3b) has very broad peaks assignable to typical orthorhombic Ta 2 O 5 , which suggests the formation of Ta 2 O 5 nanocrystals.The crystallite size of CMTS-1073K was estimated to be 12.8 nm using the Scherrer equation (Table 1), which agrees well with that determined from the FE-SEM and TEM images. The FE-SEM images (Fig. 2b andc) show that heat-treatment conducted at a higher temperature (1173 K; CMTS-1173K) resulted in a larger nanocrystal size (ca.15 nm).The submicronsized spherical particle shape was mostly retained, even though aggregation of Ta 2 O 5 nanocrystals occurred during heat-treatment at higher than 1073 K.When heat-treatment was performed at 1073 K without carbon-filling (non-CMTS), the morphology of the particles was entirely changed and large primary particles with diameters in the range of 40-200 nm were obtained (Fig. 2d).This result strongly indicates that carbon plays an important role in retaining the spherical shape of the MTS and forming nanocrystals during crystallization.The structures of the CMTS are similar to monodispersed mesoporous tin oxide spheres (MMTOS) prepared using MSCS as a host 29 and these results indicate that this simple procedure of direct CMTS preparation using carbon reinforcement could be applicable to the direct crystallization of other mesoporous metal oxides. The XRD patterns shown in Fig. 3 indicate that the peaks for CMTS became larger and sharper with increased calcination temperature.Table 1 lists the crystallite size estimated using the Scherrer equation, which increased from 12.8 to 15.1 nm by increasing the temperature from 1073 to 1173 K.The small-angle peak at 2q 14 2 observed for amorphous MTS was absent in the XRD patterns for all heat-treated samples (data not shown), which suggests that the wormhole-like mesostructure of MTS was lost during crystallization. Fig. 4 shows nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms for CMTS, and the total pore volume, specific surface area, and average pore diameter calculated from the isotherms are listed in Table 1.All of the isotherms of the CMTS samples obtained by carbon-reinforcement are type IV curves (Fig. 4A(a-c)), which indicates a mesoporous structure, while non-CMTS obtained without carbon-filling exhibited poor nitrogen adsorption and thus no mesoporosity (Fig. 4A(d)).CMTS had a relatively high specific surface area (45-105 m 2 g A1 ) and mesopores with average diameters in the range of 5.6-17 nm (Table 1) after crystallization.TEM and XRD results confirmed that the Ta 2 O 5 nanocrystal size increased with temperature, resulting in larger pore diameter and smaller specific surface area.Therefore, the pore diameter of CMTS can be easily tunable by changing the crystallization temperature.During the calcination of the CMTScarbon composite, carbon was removed by combustion, generating interparticle nanospaces between the Ta 2 O 5 nanocrystals, so that submicron-sized CMTS with different pore sizes were successfully obtained. Ta 2 O 5 exhibits photocatalytic activity for H 2 evolution under UV irradiation (320 nm). 12319,9,25 To investigate the effect of the surface area and morphology of Ta 2 O 5 on photocatalytic activity, photocatalytic reactions of various CMTS samples and Ta 2 O 5 powder were performed in aqueous solutions containing methanol (20 vol), pre-purged with Ar gas under UV irradiation for 24 h.The results given in Table S1 (ESI ) suggest that the surface area, particle size and crystalline structure of Ta 2 O 5 have a significant effect on the photocatalytic activity for H 2 evolution and that CMTS is an excellent photocatalyst with the highest amount of H 2 evolution due to its controlled morphology and large surface area compared with other mesoporous or nonmesoporous Ta 2 O 5 particles that have been previously reported.The catalytic activity of the CMTS catalysts was dependent on the specific surface area, and CMTS-1073K with the highest surface area of 105 m 2 g A1 gave the highest amount of evolved H 2 . N-doping of CMTS was conducted to sensitize CMTS to visible light.CMTS-1073K, which had the highest photocatalytic H 2 evolution rate, was subjected to treatment with gaseous NH 3 .To date, the preparation of N-Ta 2 O 5 for photoenergy conversion has only been reported for N-doping of non-porous Ta 2 O 5 -fine. 91011 The particle size and specific surface area of Ta 2 O 5 -fine were 20-40 nm and 24 m 2 g A1 , respectively (Fig. S5b, ESI ).For comparison, N-doping of Ta 2 O 5 -fine (N-Ta 2 O 5 -fine) was also conducted and the morphological properties are summarized in Table 2.The color of CMTS became yellowish by NH 3 treatment at 873 K, and the XRD peaks for N-CMTS remained unchanged from those for CMTS.No TaON or Ta 3 N 5 peaks were detected, as previously reported (Fig. S6, ESI ), 9 which indicates that N-doping of orthorhombic CMTS was successfully achieved.It was also confirmed that N-CMTS mostly retained the mesoporosity and morphology of CMTS, as determined by nitrogen adsorptiondesorption measurement and FE-SEM observation (Table 2 and Fig. S7,ESI ).The UV-vis diffuse reflection spectrum of N-CMTS shown in Fig. S8 (ESI ) indicates that no blue shift originated from the quantum size effect was observed compared to that of N-Ta 2 O 5 -fine.XPS analysis determined the nitrogen concentration to be 5.0 at (Table 2).Thus, N-CMTS consists of N-Ta 2 O 5 nanocrystals.In addition, both peaks around 400 and 396.6 eV were observed in the XPS spectra (Fig. S9,ESI ), which indicate that N-CMTS is a p-type semiconductor whose conduction band minimum (E CBM ) and valence band maximum (E VBM ) of N-CMTS are likely to be located at A1.3 V (vs.NHE) and 1.1 V, respectively, as we have recently confirmed. 9otocatalytic hydrogen evolution and CO 2 reduction under visible light irradiation using N-CMTS Photocatalytic H 2 evolution reactions of N-CMTS were performed in acetonitrile under visible light (410 nm) irradiation using triethanolamine (TEOA) as an electron donor and proton source and the results are summarized in Table 3. N-CMTS were found to be excellent visible light-sensitive photocatalysts and showed 2.1 times higher photocatalytic H 2 evolution activity than non-porous N-Ta 2 O 5 fine particles.The excellent photocatalytic activity of N-CMTS is considered to result from their morphology and their higher surface area.However, the advantage of the high surface area of N-CMTS is not fully exploited due to its lower crystallinity compared to that of N-Ta 2 O 5 -fine (Fig. S6, ESI ).The improvement of the crystallization process, such as the elongation of the thermal treatment time, would further enhance the photocatalytic activity of N-CMTS.In addition, the retention of the photocatalytic activity of N-CMTS even after 72 h of photoreaction is responsible for the stability of N-Ta 2 O 5 photocatalyst (Fig. S10, ESI ).Hybrid photocatalysts for CO 2 reduction consisting of a ruthenium complex and N-CMTS anchored by phosphonate (Ru-dpbpy-N-CMTS) were prepared by a direct assembly method (Fig. S11, ESI ), and the successful anchoring of Rudpbpy complex on N-CMTS was confirmed by ATR-FTIR spectroscopy, as previously reported for N-Ta 2 O 5 -fine.11 The Ru content of Ru-dpbpy-N-CMTS was determined by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) analysis.Although the maximum Ru content of the composite was 0.07 wt when non-mesoporous N-Ta 2 O 5 -fine was used as the semiconductor, this was increased to 0.12 wt for Ru-dpbpy-N-CMTS, which suggests that the larger surface area of N-CMTS enabled more incorporation of the Ru-dpbpy than N-Ta 2 O 5 -fine.The specific surface area and pore size of Ru-dpbpy-N-CMTS were measured by nitrogen adsorption-desorption after the incorporation of 0.12 wt Ru-dpbpy, and were found to have decreased from 86 m 2 g A1 and 6.8 nm to 70 m 2 g A1 and 6.4 nm, respectively (Fig. S12,ESI ), which indicates that Ru-dpbpy was successfully incorporated into the mesopores of nanocrystalline N-CMTS. Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with the hybrid photocatalysts was performed in MeCN/TEOA solution under visible light (410 nm) irradiation and the results are summarized in Table 3.For all hybrid samples containing the Ru-complex, the main photocatalytic reaction product from CO 2 was HCOOH. 10,32The mechanism of CO 2 reduction with this system was systematically analyzed.The visible light-excited electrons in the conduction band (CB) and the shallow defect levels in the bandgap of N-Ta 2 O 5 induced by the Ta 5f / N 2p transition are transferred to the Ru-complex catalyst within tens of picoseconds, and the transfer leads to the two-electron reduction of CO 2 to HCOOH. 12Comparison of Ru-dpbpy N-CMTS with Ru-dpbpy-N-Ta 2 O 5 -fine containing the same quantity of Ru (0.05 wt) showed that the amounts of HCOOH generated were similar, irrespective of the mesoporosity (4.7 and 4.4 mmol).This strongly suggests that photocatalytic CO 2 reduction occurs on Ru-dpbpy incorporated in the mesopores of N-CMTS.In the case of Ru-dpbpy-N-Ta 2 O 5 -fine with the highest Ru content (0.07 wt), the amount of HCOOH generated was very close to that of Ru-dpbpy-N-Ta 2 O 5 -fine with a lower Ru content (0.05 wt), which implies that the optimum amount of Ru-dpbpy for the Ru-dpbpy-N-Ta 2 O 5 -fine catalyst is approximately 0.05 wt.The limit of the Ru-dpbpy content is determined by the trade-off between the surface area necessary for simultaneous CO 2 reduction and TEOA oxidation to occur on N-Ta 2 O 5 .The coverage of Ru-dpbpy on Ru-dpbpy-N-Ta 2 O 5 -fine containing 0.05 wt Ru was estimated to be ca.16. In contrast, for Ru-dpbpy-N-CMTS containing 0.12 wt Ru, the amount of HCOOH generated was approximately 1.5 times higher than that for Ru-dpbpy-N-CMTS containing 0.05 wt Ru, which suggests that the Ru-complex incorporated into the mesopores of N-CMTS could be involved in the photocatalytic reaction.Although all of the Ru-complexes on N-CMTS were not involved in the catalytic reaction, the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to HCOOH was enhanced for N-CMTS over that for N-Ta 2 O 5 -fine.This is because the optimum loading amount of Ru-dpbpy, which is determined by the balance between the CO 2 reduction and TEOA oxidation, shifted to a higher value due to the higher surface area of N-CMTS.It has not yet been clarified if the submicron-sized spherical morphology of N-CMTS enhances the optical absorption due to light scattering.However, it is presumable that a porous semiconductor with large specific surface area composed of nanocrystals could be an excellent candidate for the photoactive framework of a hybrid photocatalyst for CO 2 reduction, because sufficient space is available for the incorporation of functional materials such as metal-complex catalysts, co-catalysts, and other semiconductor nanoparticles."}, {"llm generation": "Visible light", "source": "Visible light-sensitive N-CMTS was obtained by the nitridation of CMTS.", "context": "Control of the composition and amount of solvent during the hydrolysis and condensation of the Ta-source led to the successful synthesis of submicron-sized amorphous MTS.CMTS composed of Ta 2 O 5 nanocrystals was prepared by reinforcing MTS with carbon followed by heat-treatment.The mesopore diameter of CMTS could easily be adjusted by changing the crystallization temperature.CMTS were found to be an excellent photocatalyst for hydrogen evolution, due to their controlled morphology and large surface area.Visible light-sensitive N-CMTS was obtained by the nitridation of CMTS.N-CMTS exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution, and selective photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction using a hybrid catalyst system with a metal-complex.This confirmed that a mesoporous p-type semiconductor was generated, which would be beneficial for future solar conversion technology.The proposed synthesis methodology is simple and versatile and can be extended to the preparation of other types of crystallized mesoporous spherical semiconductors.In addition, it is considered that the unique architecture of the proposed catalyst can be widely applied to high-efficiency photocatalysis for solar energy conversion and solar fuel generation.

Crystallized MTS (CMTS) were prepared by reinforcing MTS with carbon.Fig. 2 shows SEM and FE-SEM images of the resultant CMTS prepared under various conditions.The SEM image of CMTS heat-treated at 1073 K (CMTS-1073K) confirmed that the spherical morphology was mostly retained (Fig. 2a).FE-SEM observation showed that the CMTS consist of nanoparticles with particle sizes of ca. 10 nm (Fig. 2b).TEM observation of the corresponding sample (Fig. S4a,ESI ) also revealed that the wormhole-like mesostructure of MTS was lost during heat-treatment, while the nanoparticles were homogeneously dispersed in the submicron-sized spherical particles.This is in good agreement with the results from the FE-SEM image.The corresponding XRD pattern (Fig. 3b) has very broad peaks assignable to typical orthorhombic Ta 2 O 5 , which suggests the formation of Ta 2 O 5 nanocrystals.The crystallite size of CMTS-1073K was estimated to be 12.8 nm using the Scherrer equation (Table 1), which agrees well with that determined from the FE-SEM and TEM images. The FE-SEM images (Fig. 2b andc) show that heat-treatment conducted at a higher temperature (1173 K; CMTS-1173K) resulted in a larger nanocrystal size (ca.15 nm).The submicronsized spherical particle shape was mostly retained, even though aggregation of Ta 2 O 5 nanocrystals occurred during heat-treatment at higher than 1073 K.When heat-treatment was performed at 1073 K without carbon-filling (non-CMTS), the morphology of the particles was entirely changed and large primary particles with diameters in the range of 40-200 nm were obtained (Fig. 2d).This result strongly indicates that carbon plays an important role in retaining the spherical shape of the MTS and forming nanocrystals during crystallization.The structures of the CMTS are similar to monodispersed mesoporous tin oxide spheres (MMTOS) prepared using MSCS as a host 29 and these results indicate that this simple procedure of direct CMTS preparation using carbon reinforcement could be applicable to the direct crystallization of other mesoporous metal oxides. The XRD patterns shown in Fig. 3 indicate that the peaks for CMTS became larger and sharper with increased calcination temperature.Table 1 lists the crystallite size estimated using the Scherrer equation, which increased from 12.8 to 15.1 nm by increasing the temperature from 1073 to 1173 K.The small-angle peak at 2q 14 2 observed for amorphous MTS was absent in the XRD patterns for all heat-treated samples (data not shown), which suggests that the wormhole-like mesostructure of MTS was lost during crystallization. Fig. 4 shows nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms for CMTS, and the total pore volume, specific surface area, and average pore diameter calculated from the isotherms are listed in Table 1.All of the isotherms of the CMTS samples obtained by carbon-reinforcement are type IV curves (Fig. 4A(a-c)), which indicates a mesoporous structure, while non-CMTS obtained without carbon-filling exhibited poor nitrogen adsorption and thus no mesoporosity (Fig. 4A(d)).CMTS had a relatively high specific surface area (45-105 m 2 g A1 ) and mesopores with average diameters in the range of 5.6-17 nm (Table 1) after crystallization.TEM and XRD results confirmed that the Ta 2 O 5 nanocrystal size increased with temperature, resulting in larger pore diameter and smaller specific surface area.Therefore, the pore diameter of CMTS can be easily tunable by changing the crystallization temperature.During the calcination of the CMTScarbon composite, carbon was removed by combustion, generating interparticle nanospaces between the Ta 2 O 5 nanocrystals, so that submicron-sized CMTS with different pore sizes were successfully obtained. Ta 2 O 5 exhibits photocatalytic activity for H 2 evolution under UV irradiation (320 nm). 12319,9,25 To investigate the effect of the surface area and morphology of Ta 2 O 5 on photocatalytic activity, photocatalytic reactions of various CMTS samples and Ta 2 O 5 powder were performed in aqueous solutions containing methanol (20 vol), pre-purged with Ar gas under UV irradiation for 24 h.The results given in Table S1 (ESI ) suggest that the surface area, particle size and crystalline structure of Ta 2 O 5 have a significant effect on the photocatalytic activity for H 2 evolution and that CMTS is an excellent photocatalyst with the highest amount of H 2 evolution due to its controlled morphology and large surface area compared with other mesoporous or nonmesoporous Ta 2 O 5 particles that have been previously reported.The catalytic activity of the CMTS catalysts was dependent on the specific surface area, and CMTS-1073K with the highest surface area of 105 m 2 g A1 gave the highest amount of evolved H 2 . N-doping of CMTS was conducted to sensitize CMTS to visible light.CMTS-1073K, which had the highest photocatalytic H 2 evolution rate, was subjected to treatment with gaseous NH 3 .To date, the preparation of N-Ta 2 O 5 for photoenergy conversion has only been reported for N-doping of non-porous Ta 2 O 5 -fine. 91011 The particle size and specific surface area of Ta 2 O 5 -fine were 20-40 nm and 24 m 2 g A1 , respectively (Fig. S5b, ESI ).For comparison, N-doping of Ta 2 O 5 -fine (N-Ta 2 O 5 -fine) was also conducted and the morphological properties are summarized in Table 2.The color of CMTS became yellowish by NH 3 treatment at 873 K, and the XRD peaks for N-CMTS remained unchanged from those for CMTS.No TaON or Ta 3 N 5 peaks were detected, as previously reported (Fig. S6, ESI ), 9 which indicates that N-doping of orthorhombic CMTS was successfully achieved.It was also confirmed that N-CMTS mostly retained the mesoporosity and morphology of CMTS, as determined by nitrogen adsorptiondesorption measurement and FE-SEM observation (Table 2 and Fig. S7,ESI ).The UV-vis diffuse reflection spectrum of N-CMTS shown in Fig. S8 (ESI ) indicates that no blue shift originated from the quantum size effect was observed compared to that of N-Ta 2 O 5 -fine.XPS analysis determined the nitrogen concentration to be 5.0 at (Table 2).Thus, N-CMTS consists of N-Ta 2 O 5 nanocrystals.In addition, both peaks around 400 and 396.6 eV were observed in the XPS spectra (Fig. S9,ESI ), which indicate that N-CMTS is a p-type semiconductor whose conduction band minimum (E CBM ) and valence band maximum (E VBM ) of N-CMTS are likely to be located at A1.3 V (vs.NHE) and 1.1 V, respectively, as we have recently confirmed. 9otocatalytic hydrogen evolution and CO 2 reduction under visible light irradiation using N-CMTS Photocatalytic H 2 evolution reactions of N-CMTS were performed in acetonitrile under visible light (410 nm) irradiation using triethanolamine (TEOA) as an electron donor and proton source and the results are summarized in Table 3. N-CMTS were found to be excellent visible light-sensitive photocatalysts and showed 2.1 times higher photocatalytic H 2 evolution activity than non-porous N-Ta 2 O 5 fine particles.The excellent photocatalytic activity of N-CMTS is considered to result from their morphology and their higher surface area.However, the advantage of the high surface area of N-CMTS is not fully exploited due to its lower crystallinity compared to that of N-Ta 2 O 5 -fine (Fig. S6, ESI ).The improvement of the crystallization process, such as the elongation of the thermal treatment time, would further enhance the photocatalytic activity of N-CMTS.In addition, the retention of the photocatalytic activity of N-CMTS even after 72 h of photoreaction is responsible for the stability of N-Ta 2 O 5 photocatalyst (Fig. S10, ESI ).Hybrid photocatalysts for CO 2 reduction consisting of a ruthenium complex and N-CMTS anchored by phosphonate (Ru-dpbpy-N-CMTS) were prepared by a direct assembly method (Fig. S11, ESI ), and the successful anchoring of Rudpbpy complex on N-CMTS was confirmed by ATR-FTIR spectroscopy, as previously reported for N-Ta 2 O 5 -fine.11 The Ru content of Ru-dpbpy-N-CMTS was determined by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) analysis.Although the maximum Ru content of the composite was 0.07 wt when non-mesoporous N-Ta 2 O 5 -fine was used as the semiconductor, this was increased to 0.12 wt for Ru-dpbpy-N-CMTS, which suggests that the larger surface area of N-CMTS enabled more incorporation of the Ru-dpbpy than N-Ta 2 O 5 -fine.The specific surface area and pore size of Ru-dpbpy-N-CMTS were measured by nitrogen adsorption-desorption after the incorporation of 0.12 wt Ru-dpbpy, and were found to have decreased from 86 m 2 g A1 and 6.8 nm to 70 m 2 g A1 and 6.4 nm, respectively (Fig. S12,ESI ), which indicates that Ru-dpbpy was successfully incorporated into the mesopores of nanocrystalline N-CMTS. Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with the hybrid photocatalysts was performed in MeCN/TEOA solution under visible light (410 nm) irradiation and the results are summarized in Table 3.For all hybrid samples containing the Ru-complex, the main photocatalytic reaction product from CO 2 was HCOOH. 10,32The mechanism of CO 2 reduction with this system was systematically analyzed.The visible light-excited electrons in the conduction band (CB) and the shallow defect levels in the bandgap of N-Ta 2 O 5 induced by the Ta 5f / N 2p transition are transferred to the Ru-complex catalyst within tens of picoseconds, and the transfer leads to the two-electron reduction of CO 2 to HCOOH. 12Comparison of Ru-dpbpy N-CMTS with Ru-dpbpy-N-Ta 2 O 5 -fine containing the same quantity of Ru (0.05 wt) showed that the amounts of HCOOH generated were similar, irrespective of the mesoporosity (4.7 and 4.4 mmol).This strongly suggests that photocatalytic CO 2 reduction occurs on Ru-dpbpy incorporated in the mesopores of N-CMTS.In the case of Ru-dpbpy-N-Ta 2 O 5 -fine with the highest Ru content (0.07 wt), the amount of HCOOH generated was very close to that of Ru-dpbpy-N-Ta 2 O 5 -fine with a lower Ru content (0.05 wt), which implies that the optimum amount of Ru-dpbpy for the Ru-dpbpy-N-Ta 2 O 5 -fine catalyst is approximately 0.05 wt.The limit of the Ru-dpbpy content is determined by the trade-off between the surface area necessary for simultaneous CO 2 reduction and TEOA oxidation to occur on N-Ta 2 O 5 .The coverage of Ru-dpbpy on Ru-dpbpy-N-Ta 2 O 5 -fine containing 0.05 wt Ru was estimated to be ca.16. In contrast, for Ru-dpbpy-N-CMTS containing 0.12 wt Ru, the amount of HCOOH generated was approximately 1.5 times higher than that for Ru-dpbpy-N-CMTS containing 0.05 wt Ru, which suggests that the Ru-complex incorporated into the mesopores of N-CMTS could be involved in the photocatalytic reaction.Although all of the Ru-complexes on N-CMTS were not involved in the catalytic reaction, the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to HCOOH was enhanced for N-CMTS over that for N-Ta 2 O 5 -fine.This is because the optimum loading amount of Ru-dpbpy, which is determined by the balance between the CO 2 reduction and TEOA oxidation, shifted to a higher value due to the higher surface area of N-CMTS.It has not yet been clarified if the submicron-sized spherical morphology of N-CMTS enhances the optical absorption due to light scattering.However, it is presumable that a porous semiconductor with large specific surface area composed of nanocrystals could be an excellent candidate for the photoactive framework of a hybrid photocatalyst for CO 2 reduction, because sufficient space is available for the incorporation of functional materials such as metal-complex catalysts, co-catalysts, and other semiconductor nanoparticles."}, {"llm generation": "acetonitrile", "source": "Photocatalytic H 2 evolution reactions of N-CMTS were performed in acetonitrile under visible light (410 nm) irradiation using triethanolamine (TEOA) as an electron donor and proton source and the results are summarized in Table 3.", "context": "The synthesis of amorphous Ta 2 O 5 particles was conducted using a modified ligand-assisted templating method, in which a mixture of Ta(OEt) 5 -octadecylamine was hydrolyzed in a dilute water/ organic solvent.The method employed here is based on that employed for the synthesis of mesoporous silica, in which morphological control of the particles was achieved using a large amount of solvent for hydrolysis and condensation of the silica source. 30ig. 1 shows SEM images of Ta 2 O 5 particles obtained using various solvent compositions.The particles obtained in water consisted of many agglomerates greater than 1 mm in size comprised of Ta 2 O 5 fine particles, which suggests that the fine particles formed clump together due to the fast hydrolysis and condensation rate of the tantalum source (Fig. 1a).The result was similar to that for mesoporous Ta 2 O 5 particles obtained by the conventional ligand-assisted templating method (hereafter referred to as the conventional method), 26 which indicates that utilization of a large amount of water is not effective for morphological control.To overcome this tendency, a study was conducted in which co-solvent was added to water to control the hydrolysis and condensation rate of Ta(OEt) 5 .No significant change in the particle morphology was evident with 50 : 50 (w/w) water-methanol, compared with that of the particles obtained with the water system (Fig. 1b), while particles containing both spheres and irregular particles were obtained using a waterethylene glycol solvent system (Fig. 1c).Furthermore, when both methanol and ethylene glycol were used as co-solvents (watermethanol-ethylene glycol; 30 : 50 : 20, w/w/w), independent submicron-sized spherical particles were successfully obtained (Fig. 1d).Although the reason why the unique spherical Ta 2 O 5 particles were obtained with this solvent composition is not clear, it is considered that the addition of ethylene glycol with high viscosity affects the hydrolysis and condensation rate of the Ta source and the dispersibility of the formed particles. 31-ray diffraction patterns of the Ta 2 O 5 spheres obtained with the water-methanol-ethylene glycol co-solvent system were measured to investigate the regularity of the mesopores.Fig. S1 (ESI ) shows the XRD pattern with a diffraction peak around 2q 14 2 .The pattern is identical to that for a wormhole-like mesoporous structure obtained by the conventional method. 26he nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm of the MTS (Fig. S2,ESI ) is type IV, and the BET specific surface area and BJH pore diameter were determined to be 460 m 2 g A1 and 3.4 nm, respectively.These characteristics are similar to those of mesoporous Ta 2 O 5 obtained by the conventional method, 26 which indicates that this new methodology is capable of producing spherical mesoporous Ta 2 O 5 particles.In addition, wormholelike mesoporous structures of MTS were identified by TEM observation, which supports the XRD result (Fig. S3,ESI ).These results confirm that mesoporous Ta 2 O 5 spheres (MTS) were successfully prepared for the first time. Crystallized MTS (CMTS) were prepared by reinforcing MTS with carbon.Fig. 2 shows SEM and FE-SEM images of the resultant CMTS prepared under various conditions.The SEM image of CMTS heat-treated at 1073 K (CMTS-1073K) confirmed that the spherical morphology was mostly retained (Fig. 2a).FE-SEM observation showed that the CMTS consist of nanoparticles with particle sizes of ca. 10 nm (Fig. 2b).TEM observation of the corresponding sample (Fig. S4a,ESI ) also revealed that the wormhole-like mesostructure of MTS was lost during heat-treatment, while the nanoparticles were homogeneously dispersed in the submicron-sized spherical particles.This is in good agreement with the results from the FE-SEM image.The corresponding XRD pattern (Fig. 3b) has very broad peaks assignable to typical orthorhombic Ta 2 O 5 , which suggests the formation of Ta 2 O 5 nanocrystals.The crystallite size of CMTS-1073K was estimated to be 12.8 nm using the Scherrer equation (Table 1), which agrees well with that determined from the FE-SEM and TEM images. The FE-SEM images (Fig. 2b andc) show that heat-treatment conducted at a higher temperature (1173 K; CMTS-1173K) resulted in a larger nanocrystal size (ca.15 nm).The submicronsized spherical particle shape was mostly retained, even though aggregation of Ta 2 O 5 nanocrystals occurred during heat-treatment at higher than 1073 K.When heat-treatment was performed at 1073 K without carbon-filling (non-CMTS), the morphology of the particles was entirely changed and large primary particles with diameters in the range of 40-200 nm were obtained (Fig. 2d).This result strongly indicates that carbon plays an important role in retaining the spherical shape of the MTS and forming nanocrystals during crystallization.The structures of the CMTS are similar to monodispersed mesoporous tin oxide spheres (MMTOS) prepared using MSCS as a host 29 and these results indicate that this simple procedure of direct CMTS preparation using carbon reinforcement could be applicable to the direct crystallization of other mesoporous metal oxides. The XRD patterns shown in Fig. 3 indicate that the peaks for CMTS became larger and sharper with increased calcination temperature.Table 1 lists the crystallite size estimated using the Scherrer equation, which increased from 12.8 to 15.1 nm by increasing the temperature from 1073 to 1173 K.The small-angle peak at 2q 14 2 observed for amorphous MTS was absent in the XRD patterns for all heat-treated samples (data not shown), which suggests that the wormhole-like mesostructure of MTS was lost during crystallization. Fig. 4 shows nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms for CMTS, and the total pore volume, specific surface area, and average pore diameter calculated from the isotherms are listed in Table 1.All of the isotherms of the CMTS samples obtained by carbon-reinforcement are type IV curves (Fig. 4A(a-c)), which indicates a mesoporous structure, while non-CMTS obtained without carbon-filling exhibited poor nitrogen adsorption and thus no mesoporosity (Fig. 4A(d)).CMTS had a relatively high specific surface area (45-105 m 2 g A1 ) and mesopores with average diameters in the range of 5.6-17 nm (Table 1) after crystallization.TEM and XRD results confirmed that the Ta 2 O 5 nanocrystal size increased with temperature, resulting in larger pore diameter and smaller specific surface area.Therefore, the pore diameter of CMTS can be easily tunable by changing the crystallization temperature.During the calcination of the CMTScarbon composite, carbon was removed by combustion, generating interparticle nanospaces between the Ta 2 O 5 nanocrystals, so that submicron-sized CMTS with different pore sizes were successfully obtained. Ta 2 O 5 exhibits photocatalytic activity for H 2 evolution under UV irradiation (320 nm). 12319,9,25 To investigate the effect of the surface area and morphology of Ta 2 O 5 on photocatalytic activity, photocatalytic reactions of various CMTS samples and Ta 2 O 5 powder were performed in aqueous solutions containing methanol (20 vol), pre-purged with Ar gas under UV irradiation for 24 h.The results given in Table S1 (ESI ) suggest that the surface area, particle size and crystalline structure of Ta 2 O 5 have a significant effect on the photocatalytic activity for H 2 evolution and that CMTS is an excellent photocatalyst with the highest amount of H 2 evolution due to its controlled morphology and large surface area compared with other mesoporous or nonmesoporous Ta 2 O 5 particles that have been previously reported.The catalytic activity of the CMTS catalysts was dependent on the specific surface area, and CMTS-1073K with the highest surface area of 105 m 2 g A1 gave the highest amount of evolved H 2 . N-doping of CMTS was conducted to sensitize CMTS to visible light.CMTS-1073K, which had the highest photocatalytic H 2 evolution rate, was subjected to treatment with gaseous NH 3 .To date, the preparation of N-Ta 2 O 5 for photoenergy conversion has only been reported for N-doping of non-porous Ta 2 O 5 -fine. 91011 The particle size and specific surface area of Ta 2 O 5 -fine were 20-40 nm and 24 m 2 g A1 , respectively (Fig. S5b, ESI ).For comparison, N-doping of Ta 2 O 5 -fine (N-Ta 2 O 5 -fine) was also conducted and the morphological properties are summarized in Table 2.The color of CMTS became yellowish by NH 3 treatment at 873 K, and the XRD peaks for N-CMTS remained unchanged from those for CMTS.No TaON or Ta 3 N 5 peaks were detected, as previously reported (Fig. S6, ESI ), 9 which indicates that N-doping of orthorhombic CMTS was successfully achieved.It was also confirmed that N-CMTS mostly retained the mesoporosity and morphology of CMTS, as determined by nitrogen adsorptiondesorption measurement and FE-SEM observation (Table 2 and Fig. S7,ESI ).The UV-vis diffuse reflection spectrum of N-CMTS shown in Fig. S8 (ESI ) indicates that no blue shift originated from the quantum size effect was observed compared to that of N-Ta 2 O 5 -fine.XPS analysis determined the nitrogen concentration to be 5.0 at (Table 2).Thus, N-CMTS consists of N-Ta 2 O 5 nanocrystals.In addition, both peaks around 400 and 396.6 eV were observed in the XPS spectra (Fig. S9,ESI ), which indicate that N-CMTS is a p-type semiconductor whose conduction band minimum (E CBM ) and valence band maximum (E VBM ) of N-CMTS are likely to be located at A1.3 V (vs.NHE) and 1.1 V, respectively, as we have recently confirmed. 9otocatalytic hydrogen evolution and CO 2 reduction under visible light irradiation using N-CMTS Photocatalytic H 2 evolution reactions of N-CMTS were performed in acetonitrile under visible light (410 nm) irradiation using triethanolamine (TEOA) as an electron donor and proton source and the results are summarized in Table 3.

A typical synthesis of MTS employs a modified ligand-assisted templating method, 23,26 as follows.Octadecylamine (6.15 mmol) and Ta(OEt) 5 (12.3 mmol) were dissolved in methanol.The mixture of octadecylamine-Ta(OEt) 5 was then added to 1000 g of a water/organic solvent solution with vigorous stirring at 298 K.After 5 h of continuous stirring, the resulting white powder was then filtered and the Ta 2 O 5 -surfactant composite was added to 25 mL of water in a Teflon-lined autoclave.The autoclave was sealed and placed in an oven and heated at 353 K for 1 day, 373 K for 1 day, and then 453 K for 7 days.The resulting powder was filtered and washed twice with a water/ ethanol solution and then dried. 1 g of this powder was heated in 100 mL of ethanol solution containing 1 mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid at 333 K for 3 h to remove the surfactant.The resultant powder was filtered, washed several times with ethanol, and dried at 318 K. Furfuryl alcohol was used as a carbon source.First, the mesopores of MTS were filled with furfuryl alcohol until incipient wetness was achieved.The impregnated sample was then heated at 423 K for 24 h in air to polymerize the furfuryl alcohol, with subsequent carbonization accompanied by crystallization of Ta 2 O 5 at 1073-1173 K for 1 h under a nitrogen atmosphere.Calcination of the carbon-CMTS composite was carried out at 823 K for 5 h in air to remove the carbon and yield crystallized MTS (CMTS).N-CMTS was prepared by annealing CMTS under an NH 3 flow at 848 K for 6 h.
