Results demonstrate that, CO 2 adsorption capacity (97.8 mg g A1 ) of Bi 2 WO 6 /ACSs, is nearly 40 times higher than that (2.49 mg g A1 ) of pure Bi 2 WO 6 .Moreover, the CO yield of Bi 2 WO 6 /ACSs achieves 57.5 lmol g A1 h A1 , 2.25 times higher than that of Bi 2 WO 6 .After five consecutive runs, there is no obvious loss for the photocatalytic activity, recyclability and stability of Bi 2 WO 6 /ACSs.A possible enhanced photocatalysis mechanism is provided for further understanding the synergetic effect of Bi 2 WO 6 microspheres and ACSs.Our findings should give new insights and ideas to faultlessly design higher efficient catalysts for CO 2 to solar fuels."}, {"llm generation": "Bi\u2082WO\u2086/ACSs", "source": "Finally, the products were filtered, dried and annealed at 400 C to obtain Bi 2 WO 6 /ACSs.", "context": "Firstly, phenolic resin spheres as precursors were synthesized via thermal polymerization process, then heated to 800 C and activated in a tube furnace under N 2 and H 2 O(g) atmospheres to obtain https://doi.org/10.1016/j.matlet.2019.1272010167-577X/O 2019 Elsevier B.V.
