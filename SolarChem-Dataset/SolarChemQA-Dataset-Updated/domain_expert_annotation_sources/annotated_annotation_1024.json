Various cocatalysts-loaded SrTiO 3 :Rh(1) and BiVO 4 powders were suspended in water without any electron mediators, and then CO 2 reduction was carried out under visible light irradiation in an 1 atm of CO 2 as shown in Table 1.When non-loaded SrTiO 3 :Rh was used as a reducing photocatalyst, CO evolved accompanied with H 2 and O 2 evolution due to water splitting under visible light (entry 1).The ratio of reacted electrons to holes (e -/h ) was almost 1.In the absence of CO 2 , H 2 and O 2 but no CO were obtained (entry 2).Thus, we ruled out the possibility that the CO formation was originated from contaminants.Moreover, we also confirmed that these products were not obtained when only SrTiO 3 :Rh or BiVO 4 alone was used.Thus, the Zscheme photocatalyst using bare-SrTiO 3 :Rh and BiVO 4 reduced CO 2 to CO using water as an electron donor under visible light irradiation.The Z-schematic CO 2 reduction system works via interparticle electron transfer from BiVO 4 to SrTiO 3 :Rh, because any electron mediators were not used in the system.Ag, Au, Ru, Cu, and Pt cocatalysts were loaded on SrTiO 3 :Rh of a reducing photocatalyst by photodeposition aiming at enhancement of CO formation.XRF analysis revealed that most of charged amounts of cocatalyst was deposited.The sizes of loaded cocatalysts were smaller than a few tens nm, judging from the SEM images (Figure S1,S2). When Ag or Au cocatalyst-loaded SrTiO 3 :Rh was used as a reducing photocatalyst, the Zscheme photocatalyst showed higher CO evolution activity and selectivity than that using nonloaded SrTiO 3 :Rh (entries 1, 3, 5, 7).The effect of Au cocatalyst was a little bit better than that of Ag.This is reasonable from the viewpoint of electrocatalytic CO 2 reduction because Au and Ag metal electrodes are active to reduce CO 2 to CO. 37,38 Especially, Au electrocatalyst can work for CO 2 reduction under applied bias lower than Ag electrocatalyst. 37,39Therefore, Au cocatalyst was more active than Ag for SrTiO 3 :Rh photocatalyst with a low conduction band level, being different from photocatalysts such as BaLa 4 Ti 4 O 15 with a high conduction band level in which Ag was more effective for CO formation 5 .Moreover, CO evolution was not observed under an Ar atmosphere in the Z-schematic reaction with Au-loaded SrTiO 3 :Rh (entry 6).On the other hand, when Ru-loaded SrTiO 3 :Rh was used, water splitting activity was improved, while CO selectivity was not improved (entries 9, 10).Loading Cu or Pt cocatalyst resulted in decreasing both CO 2 reduction and water splitting activities (entries 11, 12).Cu is a well-known electrocatalyst for CO 2 reduction to form hydrocarbons. 37,38 However, the performance of Cu electrode strongly depends on the reaction conditions in addition to the Cu morphology. 38,40In photocatalytic CO 2 reduction using water as an electron donor, O 2 evolved by water oxidation might hinder the Cu cocatalyst to work as an effective active site for CO 2 reduction.We also confirmed formic acid and methane were not obtained above reactions by using IC and GC-FID, respectively. Photoelectrochemical measurement is a beneficial technique to clarify the role of cocatalyst.It is important to conduct bulk electrolysis to measure not only current but also products.Therefore, we have conducted photoelectrochemical CO 2 reduction using a SrTiO 3 :Rh photocathode 31 as the bulk electrolysis to confirm if Ag and Au cocatalysts on SrTiO 3 :Rh function as an active site for CO 2 reduction as shown in Table 2.The photoelectrochemical CO 2 reduction was carried out at 0 V vs. RHE under visible light.Non, Ag, and Au cocatalysts-loaded SrTiO 3 :Rh(4) photocathodes gave cathodic photocurrent under visible light.Non-loaded SrTiO 3 :Rh photocathode was active for CO 2 reduction in addition to water reduction to form H 2 under visible light.Moreover, although photocurrent density decreased, loading Ag and Au cocatalysts on SrTiO 3 :Rh photocathodes improved CO 2 reduction.The total Faradic efficiencies (FE) for H 2 and CO formations were almost 100 within margin of experimental error.These bulk electrolysis indicated Ag and Au cocatalysts on SrTiO 3 :Rh functioned as an active site for CO 2 reduction to form CO, agreeing with the photocatalytic performance. Although the Ag cocatalyst improved CO 2 reduction activity, the CO selectivity was still quite low.In contrast to this, it has been reported that Ag/SrTiO 3 and Ag/SrTiO 3 :Al working under UV light mainly produces CO rather than H 2 . 8In the previous report, Al-doping into SrTiO 3 improved CO formation rate and selectivity, suggesting dopant of SrTiO 3 was a key issue for CO 2 reduction.In the present study, although Rh-dopant contributed to visible light response, it might kill the CO 2 reduction property. We also investigated the effects of the loading amounts of Au-cocatalyst over SrTiO 3 :Rh(1) on Z-schematic CO 2 reduction (Table 1, entries 4-8).A CO evolution rate and a CO selectivity increased by the increase in the amount of Au cocatalyst up to 0.4 wt or 0.7 wt, while 1.0 wt of Au led lower CO evolution and CO selectivity.The size of the Au cocatalyst became larger by increasing loading amount judging from SEM images (Figure S2), indicating that fine Au cocatalysts might be effective as an active site for CO 2 reduction.Thus, an optimum amount of the Au cocatalyst on SrTiO 3 :Rh was 0.4 -0.7 wt for the Z-schematic CO 2 reduction. The pH dependence of Z-schematic CO 2 reduction using Au/SrTiO 3 :Rh and BiVO 4 working via interparticle electron transfer under visible light irradiation was also examined as shown in Table 3. Z-schematic CO 2 reduction proceeded around pH 3.5 -5 (entries 3-5), while the CO 2 reduction activity was negligible corresponding to the water splitting activity in strong acidic and neutral pH conditions (entries 1, 2, 6, 7).It has been reported, in an interparticle Z-scheme system using Ru/SrTiO 3 :Rh and BiVO 4 , the pH of a reactant solution drastically affects water splitting. 25In more detail, Ru/SrTiO 3 :Rh and BiVO 4 particles aggregate well with each other due to their surface charge around pH 3 -4 adjusted with H 2 SO 4 , resulting in efficient Z-schematic water splitting via smooth interparticle electron transfer without any electron mediators.On the other hand, in neutral pH or strong acid condition, the Z-scheme system shows low water splitting activity because Ru/SrTiO 3 :Rh and BiVO 4 particles exist separately from each other with poor contact.Therefore, suspension of SrTiO 3 :Rh and BiVO 4 particles after CO 2 reduction at different pH was observed using an optical microscope to see the aggregation state, as shown in Figure 2. SrTiO 3 :Rh particles existed separately from BiVO 4 particles under neutral pH and strong acid (pH 2.4) even in the presence of CO 2 .In contrast, the particles aggregated well with each other in the acidic reactant solution around pH 4 even in the presence of CO 2 , resulting in proceeding of Z-schematic CO 2 reduction.Not bicarbonate ion or carbonate ion but CO 2 molecules dissolved in an aqueous solution is the reactant. 11The concentration of dissolved CO 2 molecules is not strongly depended on the pH judging from the chemical equilibrium. 41It mainly depends on the partial pressure.Therefore, it is not strange that CO 2 reduction proceeds even at low pH although H 2 evolution may be enhanced.The pH dependence of the photocatalytic activity and optical microscope images clearly indicated that aggregation between SrTiO 3 :Rh and BiVO 4 particles was the key point in the present system, because the Z-scheme system without an ionic electron mediator worked via interparticle electron transfer.It should be stressed that CO 2 reduction proceeded using only photocatalyst powders, water, and CO 2 without any additives, because of good aggregation between SrTiO 3 :Rh and BiVO 4 particles by selfadjustment of pH. We have also evaluated Z-schematic CO 2 reduction using a Co complex and an Fe ion of an ionic electron mediator, Au/SrTiO 3 :Rh, and BiVO 4 in a simple suspension system under visible light irradiation as shown in Table 4.The Co complex enhanced water splitting and suppressed CO 2 reduction compared with a non-mediator system at pH 4 -5.The photocatalytic activity decreased and CO 2 reduction did not proceed at pH 6.8 adjusted with NaHCO 3 in the presence of the Co complex.The low activity for CO evolution might be due to adsorbed inhibitor of an ionic electron mediator to active site for CO 2 reduction of Au cocatalyst-loaded on SrTiO 3 :Rh.A Z-scheme system in the presence of Fe ion mediator was active only for water splitting under visible light even in the presence of CO 2 .No CO evolution might be due to high concentration of proton at strong acid in addition to adsorbed inhibitor of an ionic electron mediator.

Although the Ag cocatalyst improved CO 2 reduction activity, the CO selectivity was still quite low.In contrast to this, it has been reported that Ag/SrTiO 3 and Ag/SrTiO 3 :Al working under UV light mainly produces CO rather than H 2 . 8In the previous report, Al-doping into SrTiO 3 improved CO formation rate and selectivity, suggesting dopant of SrTiO 3 was a key issue for CO 2 reduction.In the present study, although Rh-dopant contributed to visible light response, it might kill the CO 2 reduction property. We also investigated the effects of the loading amounts of Au-cocatalyst over SrTiO 3 :Rh(1) on Z-schematic CO 2 reduction (Table 1, entries 4-8).A CO evolution rate and a CO selectivity increased by the increase in the amount of Au cocatalyst up to 0.4 wt or 0.7 wt, while 1.0 wt of Au led lower CO evolution and CO selectivity.The size of the Au cocatalyst became larger by increasing loading amount judging from SEM images (Figure S2), indicating that fine Au cocatalysts might be effective as an active site for CO 2 reduction.Thus, an optimum amount of the Au cocatalyst on SrTiO 3 :Rh was 0.4 -0.7 wt for the Z-schematic CO 2 reduction.

Z-schematic CO 2 reduction proceeded around pH 3.5 -5 (entries 3-5), while the CO 2 reduction activity was negligible corresponding to the water splitting activity in strong acidic and neutral pH conditions (entries 1, 2, 6, 7).It has been reported, in an interparticle Z-scheme system using Ru/SrTiO 3 :Rh and BiVO 4 , the pH of a reactant solution drastically affects water splitting. 25In more detail, Ru/SrTiO 3 :Rh and BiVO 4 particles aggregate well with each other due to their surface charge around pH 3 -4 adjusted with H 2 SO 4 , resulting in efficient Z-schematic water splitting via smooth interparticle electron transfer without any electron mediators.On the other hand, in neutral pH or strong acid condition, the Z-scheme system shows low water splitting activity because Ru/SrTiO 3 :Rh and BiVO 4 particles exist separately from each other with poor contact.Therefore, suspension of SrTiO 3 :Rh and BiVO 4 particles after CO 2 reduction at different pH was observed using an optical microscope to see the aggregation state, as shown in Figure 2. SrTiO 3 :Rh particles existed separately from BiVO 4 particles under neutral pH and strong acid (pH 2.4) even in the presence of CO 2 .In contrast, the particles aggregated well with each other in the acidic reactant solution around pH 4 even in the presence of CO 2 , resulting in proceeding of Z-schematic CO 2 reduction.Not bicarbonate ion or carbonate ion but CO 2 molecules dissolved in an aqueous solution is the reactant. 11The concentration of dissolved CO 2 molecules is not strongly depended on the pH judging from the chemical equilibrium. 41It mainly depends on the partial pressure.Therefore, it is not strange that CO 2 reduction proceeds even at low pH although H 2 evolution may be enhanced.The pH dependence of the photocatalytic activity and optical microscope images clearly indicated that aggregation between SrTiO 3 :Rh and BiVO 4 particles was the key point in the present system, because the Z-scheme system without an ionic electron mediator worked via interparticle electron transfer.It should be stressed that CO 2 reduction proceeded using only photocatalyst powders, water, and CO 2 without any additives, because of good aggregation between SrTiO 3 :Rh and BiVO 4 particles by selfadjustment of pH.

Although the Ag cocatalyst improved CO 2 reduction activity, the CO selectivity was still quite low.In contrast to this, it has been reported that Ag/SrTiO 3 and Ag/SrTiO 3 :Al working under UV light mainly produces CO rather than H 2 . 8In the previous report, Al-doping into SrTiO 3 improved CO formation rate and selectivity, suggesting dopant of SrTiO 3 was a key issue for CO 2 reduction.In the present study, although Rh-dopant contributed to visible light response, it might kill the CO 2 reduction property. We also investigated the effects of the loading amounts of Au-cocatalyst over SrTiO 3 :Rh(1) on Z-schematic CO 2 reduction (Table 1, entries 4-8).A CO evolution rate and a CO selectivity increased by the increase in the amount of Au cocatalyst up to 0.4 wt or 0.7 wt, while 1.0 wt of Au led lower CO evolution and CO selectivity.The size of the Au cocatalyst became larger by increasing loading amount judging from SEM images (Figure S2), indicating that fine Au cocatalysts might be effective as an active site for CO 2 reduction.Thus, an optimum amount of the Au cocatalyst on SrTiO 3 :Rh was 0.4 -0.7 wt for the Z-schematic CO 2 reduction. The pH dependence of Z-schematic CO 2 reduction using Au/SrTiO 3 :Rh and BiVO 4 working via interparticle electron transfer under visible light irradiation was also examined as shown in Table 3. Z-schematic CO 2 reduction proceeded around pH 3.5 -5 (entries 3-5), while the CO 2 reduction activity was negligible corresponding to the water splitting activity in strong acidic and neutral pH conditions (entries 1, 2, 6, 7).It has been reported, in an interparticle Z-scheme system using Ru/SrTiO 3 :Rh and BiVO 4 , the pH of a reactant solution drastically affects water splitting. 25In more detail, Ru/SrTiO 3 :Rh and BiVO 4 particles aggregate well with each other due to their surface charge around pH 3 -4 adjusted with H 2 SO 4 , resulting in efficient Z-schematic water splitting via smooth interparticle electron transfer without any electron mediators.On the other hand, in neutral pH or strong acid condition, the Z-scheme system shows low water splitting activity because Ru/SrTiO 3 :Rh and BiVO 4 particles exist separately from each other with poor contact.Therefore, suspension of SrTiO 3 :Rh and BiVO 4 particles after CO 2 reduction at different pH was observed using an optical microscope to see the aggregation state, as shown in Figure 2. SrTiO 3 :Rh particles existed separately from BiVO 4 particles under neutral pH and strong acid (pH 2.4) even in the presence of CO 2 .In contrast, the particles aggregated well with each other in the acidic reactant solution around pH 4 even in the presence of CO 2 , resulting in proceeding of Z-schematic CO 2 reduction.Not bicarbonate ion or carbonate ion but CO 2 molecules dissolved in an aqueous solution is the reactant. 11The concentration of dissolved CO 2 molecules is not strongly depended on the pH judging from the chemical equilibrium. 41It mainly depends on the partial pressure.Therefore, it is not strange that CO 2 reduction proceeds even at low pH although H 2 evolution may be enhanced.The pH dependence of the photocatalytic activity and optical microscope images clearly indicated that aggregation between SrTiO 3 :Rh and BiVO 4 particles was the key point in the present system, because the Z-scheme system without an ionic electron mediator worked via interparticle electron transfer.It should be stressed that CO 2 reduction proceeded using only photocatalyst powders, water, and CO 2 without any additives, because of good aggregation between SrTiO 3 :Rh and BiVO 4 particles by selfadjustment of pH. We have also evaluated Z-schematic CO 2 reduction using a Co complex and an Fe ion of an ionic electron mediator, Au/SrTiO 3 :Rh, and BiVO 4 in a simple suspension system under visible light irradiation as shown in Table 4.The Co complex enhanced water splitting and suppressed CO 2 reduction compared with a non-mediator system at pH 4 -5.The photocatalytic activity decreased and CO 2 reduction did not proceed at pH 6.8 adjusted with NaHCO 3 in the presence of the Co complex.The low activity for CO evolution might be due to adsorbed inhibitor of an ionic electron mediator to active site for CO 2 reduction of Au cocatalyst-loaded on SrTiO 3 :Rh.A Z-scheme system in the presence of Fe ion mediator was active only for water splitting under visible light even in the presence of CO 2 .No CO evolution might be due to high concentration of proton at strong acid in addition to adsorbed inhibitor of an ionic electron mediator.

Various cocatalysts-loaded SrTiO 3 :Rh(1) and BiVO 4 powders were suspended in water without any electron mediators, and then CO 2 reduction was carried out under visible light irradiation in an 1 atm of CO 2 as shown in Table 1.When non-loaded SrTiO 3 :Rh was used as a reducing photocatalyst, CO evolved accompanied with H 2 and O 2 evolution due to water splitting under visible light (entry 1).The ratio of reacted electrons to holes (e -/h ) was almost 1.In the absence of CO 2 , H 2 and O 2 but no CO were obtained (entry 2).Thus, we ruled out the possibility that the CO formation was originated from contaminants.Moreover, we also confirmed that these products were not obtained when only SrTiO 3 :Rh or BiVO 4 alone was used.Thus, the Zscheme photocatalyst using bare-SrTiO 3 :Rh and BiVO 4 reduced CO 2 to CO using water as an electron donor under visible light irradiation.The Z-schematic CO 2 reduction system works via interparticle electron transfer from BiVO 4 to SrTiO 3 :Rh, because any electron mediators were not used in the system.Ag, Au, Ru, Cu, and Pt cocatalysts were loaded on SrTiO 3 :Rh of a reducing photocatalyst by photodeposition aiming at enhancement of CO formation.XRF analysis revealed that most of charged amounts of cocatalyst was deposited.The sizes of loaded cocatalysts were smaller than a few tens nm, judging from the SEM images (Figure S1,S2).

Various cocatalysts-loaded SrTiO 3 :Rh(1) and BiVO 4 powders were suspended in water without any electron mediators, and then CO 2 reduction was carried out under visible light irradiation in an 1 atm of CO 2 as shown in Table 1.When non-loaded SrTiO 3 :Rh was used as a reducing photocatalyst, CO evolved accompanied with H 2 and O 2 evolution due to water splitting under visible light (entry 1).The ratio of reacted electrons to holes (e -/h ) was almost 1.In the absence of CO 2 , H 2 and O 2 but no CO were obtained (entry 2).Thus, we ruled out the possibility that the CO formation was originated from contaminants.Moreover, we also confirmed that these products were not obtained when only SrTiO 3 :Rh or BiVO 4 alone was used.Thus, the Zscheme photocatalyst using bare-SrTiO 3 :Rh and BiVO 4 reduced CO 2 to CO using water as an electron donor under visible light irradiation.The Z-schematic CO 2 reduction system works via interparticle electron transfer from BiVO 4 to SrTiO 3 :Rh, because any electron mediators were not used in the system.Ag, Au, Ru, Cu, and Pt cocatalysts were loaded on SrTiO 3 :Rh of a reducing photocatalyst by photodeposition aiming at enhancement of CO formation.XRF analysis revealed that most of charged amounts of cocatalyst was deposited.The sizes of loaded cocatalysts were smaller than a few tens nm, judging from the SEM images (Figure S1,S2). When Ag or Au cocatalyst-loaded SrTiO 3 :Rh was used as a reducing photocatalyst, the Zscheme photocatalyst showed higher CO evolution activity and selectivity than that using nonloaded SrTiO 3 :Rh (entries 1, 3, 5, 7).The effect of Au cocatalyst was a little bit better than that of Ag.This is reasonable from the viewpoint of electrocatalytic CO 2 reduction because Au and Ag metal electrodes are active to reduce CO 2 to CO. 37,38 Especially, Au electrocatalyst can work for CO 2 reduction under applied bias lower than Ag electrocatalyst. 37,39Therefore, Au cocatalyst was more active than Ag for SrTiO 3 :Rh photocatalyst with a low conduction band level, being different from photocatalysts such as BaLa 4 Ti 4 O 15 with a high conduction band level in which Ag was more effective for CO formation 5 .Moreover, CO evolution was not observed under an Ar atmosphere in the Z-schematic reaction with Au-loaded SrTiO 3 :Rh (entry 6).On the other hand, when Ru-loaded SrTiO 3 :Rh was used, water splitting activity was improved, while CO selectivity was not improved (entries 9, 10).Loading Cu or Pt cocatalyst resulted in decreasing both CO 2 reduction and water splitting activities (entries 11, 12).Cu is a well-known electrocatalyst for CO 2 reduction to form hydrocarbons. 37,38 However, the performance of Cu electrode strongly depends on the reaction conditions in addition to the Cu morphology. 38,40In photocatalytic CO 2 reduction using water as an electron donor, O 2 evolved by water oxidation might hinder the Cu cocatalyst to work as an effective active site for CO 2 reduction.We also confirmed formic acid and methane were not obtained above reactions by using IC and GC-FID, respectively. Photoelectrochemical measurement is a beneficial technique to clarify the role of cocatalyst.It is important to conduct bulk electrolysis to measure not only current but also products.Therefore, we have conducted photoelectrochemical CO 2 reduction using a SrTiO 3 :Rh photocathode 31 as the bulk electrolysis to confirm if Ag and Au cocatalysts on SrTiO 3 :Rh function as an active site for CO 2 reduction as shown in Table 2.The photoelectrochemical CO 2 reduction was carried out at 0 V vs. RHE under visible light.Non, Ag, and Au cocatalysts-loaded SrTiO 3 :Rh(4) photocathodes gave cathodic photocurrent under visible light.Non-loaded SrTiO 3 :Rh photocathode was active for CO 2 reduction in addition to water reduction to form H 2 under visible light.Moreover, although photocurrent density decreased, loading Ag and Au cocatalysts on SrTiO 3 :Rh photocathodes improved CO 2 reduction.The total Faradic efficiencies (FE) for H 2 and CO formations were almost 100 within margin of experimental error.These bulk electrolysis indicated Ag and Au cocatalysts on SrTiO 3 :Rh functioned as an active site for CO 2 reduction to form CO, agreeing with the photocatalytic performance. Although the Ag cocatalyst improved CO 2 reduction activity, the CO selectivity was still quite low.In contrast to this, it has been reported that Ag/SrTiO 3 and Ag/SrTiO 3 :Al working under UV light mainly produces CO rather than H 2 . 8In the previous report, Al-doping into SrTiO 3 improved CO formation rate and selectivity, suggesting dopant of SrTiO 3 was a key issue for CO 2 reduction.In the present study, although Rh-dopant contributed to visible light response, it might kill the CO 2 reduction property. We also investigated the effects of the loading amounts of Au-cocatalyst over SrTiO 3 :Rh(1) on Z-schematic CO 2 reduction (Table 1, entries 4-8).A CO evolution rate and a CO selectivity increased by the increase in the amount of Au cocatalyst up to 0.4 wt or 0.7 wt, while 1.0 wt of Au led lower CO evolution and CO selectivity.The size of the Au cocatalyst became larger by increasing loading amount judging from SEM images (Figure S2), indicating that fine Au cocatalysts might be effective as an active site for CO 2 reduction.Thus, an optimum amount of the Au cocatalyst on SrTiO 3 :Rh was 0.4 -0.7 wt for the Z-schematic CO 2 reduction. The pH dependence of Z-schematic CO 2 reduction using Au/SrTiO 3 :Rh and BiVO 4 working via interparticle electron transfer under visible light irradiation was also examined as shown in Table 3. Z-schematic CO 2 reduction proceeded around pH 3.5 -5 (entries 3-5), while the CO 2 reduction activity was negligible corresponding to the water splitting activity in strong acidic and neutral pH conditions (entries 1, 2, 6, 7).It has been reported, in an interparticle Z-scheme system using Ru/SrTiO 3 :Rh and BiVO 4 , the pH of a reactant solution drastically affects water splitting. 25In more detail, Ru/SrTiO 3 :Rh and BiVO 4 particles aggregate well with each other due to their surface charge around pH 3 -4 adjusted with H 2 SO 4 , resulting in efficient Z-schematic water splitting via smooth interparticle electron transfer without any electron mediators.On the other hand, in neutral pH or strong acid condition, the Z-scheme system shows low water splitting activity because Ru/SrTiO 3 :Rh and BiVO 4 particles exist separately from each other with poor contact.Therefore, suspension of SrTiO 3 :Rh and BiVO 4 particles after CO 2 reduction at different pH was observed using an optical microscope to see the aggregation state, as shown in Figure 2. SrTiO 3 :Rh particles existed separately from BiVO 4 particles under neutral pH and strong acid (pH 2.4) even in the presence of CO 2 .In contrast, the particles aggregated well with each other in the acidic reactant solution around pH 4 even in the presence of CO 2 , resulting in proceeding of Z-schematic CO 2 reduction.Not bicarbonate ion or carbonate ion but CO 2 molecules dissolved in an aqueous solution is the reactant. 11The concentration of dissolved CO 2 molecules is not strongly depended on the pH judging from the chemical equilibrium. 41It mainly depends on the partial pressure.Therefore, it is not strange that CO 2 reduction proceeds even at low pH although H 2 evolution may be enhanced.The pH dependence of the photocatalytic activity and optical microscope images clearly indicated that aggregation between SrTiO 3 :Rh and BiVO 4 particles was the key point in the present system, because the Z-scheme system without an ionic electron mediator worked via interparticle electron transfer.It should be stressed that CO 2 reduction proceeded using only photocatalyst powders, water, and CO 2 without any additives, because of good aggregation between SrTiO 3 :Rh and BiVO 4 particles by selfadjustment of pH. We have also evaluated Z-schematic CO 2 reduction using a Co complex and an Fe ion of an ionic electron mediator, Au/SrTiO 3 :Rh, and BiVO 4 in a simple suspension system under visible light irradiation as shown in Table 4.The Co complex enhanced water splitting and suppressed CO 2 reduction compared with a non-mediator system at pH 4 -5.The photocatalytic activity decreased and CO 2 reduction did not proceed at pH 6.8 adjusted with NaHCO 3 in the presence of the Co complex.The low activity for CO evolution might be due to adsorbed inhibitor of an ionic electron mediator to active site for CO 2 reduction of Au cocatalyst-loaded on SrTiO 3 :Rh.A Z-scheme system in the presence of Fe ion mediator was active only for water splitting under visible light even in the presence of CO 2 .No CO evolution might be due to high concentration of proton at strong acid in addition to adsorbed inhibitor of an ionic electron mediator. Figure 3 shows the time course of Z-schematic CO 2 reduction using Au/SrTiO 3 :Rh and BiVO 4 photocatalysts working via interparticle electron transfer using water as a sole electron donor under visible light irradiation.CO of a CO 2 reduction product steadily formed for 10 h under visible light irradiation with H 2 and O 2 evolutions due to water splitting.Thus, we successfully constructed a new Z-schematic CO 2 reduction system using only metal oxide photocatalysts responding to visible light."}, {"llm generation": "aqueous solution", "source": "Not bicarbonate ion or carbonate ion but CO 2 molecules dissolved in an aqueous solution is the reactant.", "context": "Figure 1 shows an energy diagram of a Z-scheme photocatalyst consisting of SrTiO 3 :Rh and BiVO 4 aiming at CO 2 reduction using water as an electron donor.The conduction band levels formed by Ti 3d orbitals of SrTiO 3 :Rh are higher than the redox potential of CO 2 /CO, indicating photogenerated electrons in the conduction band of SrTiO 3 :Rh possess thermodynamically enough potential for CO 2 reduction to form CO.Moreover, BiVO 4 can oxidize water to form O 2 under visible light.Thus, the Z-scheme system using SrTiO 3 :Rh and BiVO 4 has a potential to reduce CO 2 to CO using water as a sole electron donor under visible light irradiation.

We also investigated the effects of the loading amounts of Au-cocatalyst over SrTiO 3 :Rh(1) on Z-schematic CO 2 reduction (Table 1, entries 4-8).A CO evolution rate and a CO selectivity increased by the increase in the amount of Au cocatalyst up to 0.4 wt or 0.7 wt, while 1.0 wt of Au led lower CO evolution and CO selectivity.The size of the Au cocatalyst became larger by increasing loading amount judging from SEM images (Figure S2), indicating that fine Au cocatalysts might be effective as an active site for CO 2 reduction.Thus, an optimum amount of the Au cocatalyst on SrTiO 3 :Rh was 0.4 -0.7 wt for the Z-schematic CO 2 reduction. The pH dependence of Z-schematic CO 2 reduction using Au/SrTiO 3 :Rh and BiVO 4 working via interparticle electron transfer under visible light irradiation was also examined as shown in Table 3. Z-schematic CO 2 reduction proceeded around pH 3.5 -5 (entries 3-5), while the CO 2 reduction activity was negligible corresponding to the water splitting activity in strong acidic and neutral pH conditions (entries 1, 2, 6, 7).It has been reported, in an interparticle Z-scheme system using Ru/SrTiO 3 :Rh and BiVO 4 , the pH of a reactant solution drastically affects water splitting. 25In more detail, Ru/SrTiO 3 :Rh and BiVO 4 particles aggregate well with each other due to their surface charge around pH 3 -4 adjusted with H 2 SO 4 , resulting in efficient Z-schematic water splitting via smooth interparticle electron transfer without any electron mediators.On the other hand, in neutral pH or strong acid condition, the Z-scheme system shows low water splitting activity because Ru/SrTiO 3 :Rh and BiVO 4 particles exist separately from each other with poor contact.Therefore, suspension of SrTiO 3 :Rh and BiVO 4 particles after CO 2 reduction at different pH was observed using an optical microscope to see the aggregation state, as shown in Figure 2. SrTiO 3 :Rh particles existed separately from BiVO 4 particles under neutral pH and strong acid (pH 2.4) even in the presence of CO 2 .In contrast, the particles aggregated well with each other in the acidic reactant solution around pH 4 even in the presence of CO 2 , resulting in proceeding of Z-schematic CO 2 reduction.Not bicarbonate ion or carbonate ion but CO 2 molecules dissolved in an aqueous solution is the reactant. 11The concentration of dissolved CO 2 molecules is not strongly depended on the pH judging from the chemical equilibrium. 41It mainly depends on the partial pressure.Therefore, it is not strange that CO 2 reduction proceeds even at low pH although H 2 evolution may be enhanced.The pH dependence of the photocatalytic activity and optical microscope images clearly indicated that aggregation between SrTiO 3 :Rh and BiVO 4 particles was the key point in the present system, because the Z-scheme system without an ionic electron mediator worked via interparticle electron transfer.It should be stressed that CO 2 reduction proceeded using only photocatalyst powders, water, and CO 2 without any additives, because of good aggregation between SrTiO 3 :Rh and BiVO 4 particles by selfadjustment of pH. We have also evaluated Z-schematic CO 2 reduction using a Co complex and an Fe ion of an ionic electron mediator, Au/SrTiO 3 :Rh, and BiVO 4 in a simple suspension system under visible light irradiation as shown in Table 4.The Co complex enhanced water splitting and suppressed CO 2 reduction compared with a non-mediator system at pH 4 -5.The photocatalytic activity decreased and CO 2 reduction did not proceed at pH 6.8 adjusted with NaHCO 3 in the presence of the Co complex.The low activity for CO evolution might be due to adsorbed inhibitor of an ionic electron mediator to active site for CO 2 reduction of Au cocatalyst-loaded on SrTiO 3 :Rh.A Z-scheme system in the presence of Fe ion mediator was active only for water splitting under visible light even in the presence of CO 2 .No CO evolution might be due to high concentration of proton at strong acid in addition to adsorbed inhibitor of an ionic electron mediator. Figure 3 shows the time course of Z-schematic CO 2 reduction using Au/SrTiO 3 :Rh and BiVO 4 photocatalysts working via interparticle electron transfer using water as a sole electron donor under visible light irradiation.CO of a CO 2 reduction product steadily formed for 10 h under visible light irradiation with H 2 and O 2 evolutions due to water splitting.Thus, we successfully constructed a new Z-schematic CO 2 reduction system using only metal oxide photocatalysts responding to visible light."}, {"llm generation": "Liquid", "source": "Photocatalyst: 0.1 g each, cocatalyst: Au (0.4 wt, photodeposition), reactant solution: water (120 mL), light source: 300 W Xe lamp ( 420 nm), flow gas: CO 2 (1 atm), cell: top-irradiation cell with a Pyrex window.", "context": "A Z-scheme system consisting of SrTiO 3 :Rh and BiVO 4 reduced CO 2 to CO via interparticle electron transfer using water as an electron donor in a simple suspension system under visible light irradiation.Loading Ag or Au cocatalyst was effective for enhancement of CO formation, although CO 2 reduction proceeded even by using non-loaded SrTiO 3 :Rh as a reducing photocatalyst.The effect of loading Ag and Au was reasonable judging from photoelectrochemical properties.The optimum pH of a reactant solution for Z-schematic CO 2 reduction via interparticle electron transfer was 3.5 -5, because SrTiO 3 :Rh and BiVO 4 photocatalyst particles aggregated well with each other, resulting in smooth electron transfer from BiVO 4 to SrTiO 3 :Rh.It is stressed that the Z-schematic CO 2 reduction system worked due to good aggregation by using just photocatalyst powders, water, and CO 2 by self-adjustment of pH.The finding suggests that many various metal oxide photocatalysts can be employed for Zschematic CO 2 reduction utilizing water as an electron donor under visible light irradiation.
