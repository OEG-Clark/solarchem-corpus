    "content": "In this study we investigated, theoretically and experimentally, the unique photoactive behavior of pristine and defected indium oxide surfaces providing fundamental insights into their excited state properties as well as an explanation for the experimentally observed enhanced activity of defected indium oxide surfaces for the gas-phase reverse water gas shift reaction, CO 2 H 2 h CO H 2 O in the light compared to the dark.To this end, a detailed excited-state study of pristine and defected forms of indium oxide (In 2 O 3 , In 2 O 3-x , In 2 O 3 (OH) y and In 2 O 3-x (OH) y ) surfaces was performed using time dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations, the results of which were supported experimentally by transient absorption spectroscopy and photoconductivity measurements.It was found that the surface frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) created by a Lewis acidic coordinately unsaturated surface indium site proximal to an oxygen vacancy and a Lewis basic surface hydroxide site in In 2 O 3-x (OH) y become more acidic and basic and hence more active in the ES compared to the GS.This provides a theoretical mechanism responsible for the enhanced activity and reduced activation energy of the photochemical reverse water gas shift reaction observed experimentally for In 2 O 3-x (OH) y compared to the thermochemical reaction.This fundamental insight into the role of photoexcited surface FLPs for catalytic CO 2 reduction could lead to improved photocatalysts for solar fuel production."

    "content": "Computational Methods.To analyze the excited states of pristine and defected forms of indium oxide, the NWChem package 14 within linear response time-dependent density functional theory (LR-TDDFT) was used.LR-TDDFT in combination with appropriate exchange correlation functionals has become an attractive method for reliable excited state calculations involving single excitations in a wide range of materials. 15,16In this work, the B3LYP exchange correlation potential was used which has been shown to perform well for the In x O y system 17 with the split-valence double-zeta 3-21G basis set.With this description, we have a total of 365 and 314 basis functions for the pristine bulk and surface In 2 O 3 cluster, respectively.In these calculations, no effective core potential was used, hence all electrons (e.g., 324 electrons for the 50 atom cluster of pristine In 2 O 3 , Figure 1(a)) actively participated in the configurational space.The clusters were fully geometry optimized using quasi-newton algorithm with the convergence criterion of 10 -8 Hartree (1 Hartee 13.6 eV) for the energy and 10 -6 Hartree/Bohr for its gradient.During optimization, all of the interior atoms were allowed to move, while all of the pseudohydrogen saturators were kept fixed.To ensure the global minima of each cluster, frequency calculations were conducted for the optimized geometries which yielded zero imaginary frequencies.Figures 1a,1b Materials Synthesis.The synthesis of the In 2 O 3-x (OH) y photocatalytic nanocrystals has been described in detail elsewhere. 18riefly, an amorphous indium hydroxide precursor was synthesized by dissolving indium(III) chloride (3.6 g, 16.2 mmol, Sigma-Aldrich, 98) in a 3:1 solution of anhydrous ethanol (54 mL, Commercial Alcohols) and deionized, nanopure water (18 mL, resistivity 18.2 M cm).A separate solution of 3:1 mixture of ethanol (54 mL) and ammonium hydroxide (18 mL, Caledon, 28-30 adjusted to 25 wt with deionized water) was rapidly added, resulting in the immediate formation of a white precipitate.The resulting suspension was immediately immersed in a preheated oil bath at 80 C and stirred at a high rate for 10 min.The precipitate was then separated via centrifugation and washed 3 times with deionized water.Subsequently, the precipitate was sonicated between washings to ensure adequate removal of any trapped impurities and then dried overnight at 80 C in a vacuum oven.The dried precursor powder was finely ground with a mortar and pestle, and calcined for 3 h in air at 250 C. Materials Characterization.Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) was performed on a Bruker D2-Phaser X-ray diffractometer, using Cu K radiation at 30 kV.Sample morphology was determined using a JEOL-2010 high resolution transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM).Diffuse reflectance of the sample was measured using a Lambda 1050 UV/vis/NIR spectrometer from PerkinElmer and an integrating sphere with a diameter of 150 mm.The diffuse reflectance spectrum was then fitted with a modified Kubelka-Munk function 19 to determine the optical band gap of each sample.Specifically, (F(R)h) n is plotted as a function of photon energy where F(R) (1 -R) 2 /2R; R is the diffuse reflectance of the sample and n was set to 3/2 in accordance with the direct forbidden band gap of In 2 O 3 .The linear portion of the plot was extrapolated and its intercept with the abscissa provided the band gap estimate. Transient absorption measurements were carried out with a Helios UV-visible spectrometer (Ultrafast Systems).A pump wavelength of 318 nm was chosen to excite the sample above the optical-band gap.The pump light was obtained from the fourth harmonic of the signal from a Coherent OPerA Solo optical parametric amplifier which was pumped by a Coherent Libra regeneratively amplified Ti:sapphire laser (809 nm, 50 fs pulses, 1 kHz repetition rate).A broadband probe beam was produced by focusing a small fraction of the fundamental wavelength into a sapphire or CaF 2 crystal.Both pump and probe were focused and overlapped on the surface of the sample-coated quartz substrate.The transmitted probe light was used to determine the transient absorption by focusing it into a fiber-coupled Si array detector with a detection range of 300-907 nm.Scattered pump light was blocked by a long-pass filter placed before the detector.A rotating mechanical chopper blocked every other pump pulse with the difference between two consecutive spectraone with the pump beam, and one withoutyielding the TA signal A(t), where t is the time delay between pump and probe pulses.The spot size of the pump beam incident on the sample was used to determine the fluence, or energy per laser pulse divided by the irradiated area.For one-photon absorption, the number of absorbed photons is proportional to the incident fluence.The spatial profile of the laser beam spot on the sample surface was approximately a twodimensional Gaussian.The radius of the beam is defined as the length over which the intensity falls from the maximum to 1/e 2 times the maximum.This radius was measured by the knife-edge method, in which a beam block with a straight edge (in this case, a razor blade) is translated through the laser spot and the power is recorded as a function of the beam block position. 20The razor blade was placed in the Helios sample holder and translated by a Newport NSA12 motorized actuator, with the power measured by a calibrated Si photodiode optical power sensor (Newport 818-UV). An approximately 50 m thick film of close packed In 2 O 3-x (OH) y nanoparticles was layered with an array of 1 mm by 1 mm silver electrodes of 250 m spacing.An external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurement setup comprising a Keithley 2440 source meter, Spectra Product CM110 monochromator, Hg/Xe 200W lamp, Princeton Model 5210 lock in amplifier, beam splitter and chopper was used to conduct a 4 point probe I-V measurement over a 650 to 420 nm incident wavelength spectral range from the higher wavelengths to lower wavelengths in order to prevent persistent photoconductivity at the main absorption edge from carrying over to the higher wavelengths.The conductance value at each wavelength point was taken after a 10 min illumination to allow any significant photocurrent value change to be detected.The measured photocurrent was normalized over the incident power to determine the EQE.To prove that photoconductivity is present at the higher wavelength regime, we took photoconductance measurements at several monochromatic wavelengths (380, 420, 450, 480, 520, 560 and 632 nm He-Ne 1 mW laser) over time with illumination on and subsequently off.No change in conductivity was detected with a 50 mW 913 nm (1.35 eV) laser."

    "content": "Development and Validation of Cluster Models.Since the detailed excited state computations on a periodic (slab) model of In 2 O 3 (111) surface would be computationally prohibitive, equivalent saturated cluster models were developed. 212222324 The covalent embedding procedure, 21,22 where cluster models are terminated with suitably chosen pseudohydrogen saturators, is used to model the surface of pristine defect-free In 2 O 3 (In 2 O 3 ), shown in Figure 1a, and with only oxygen vacancy (In 2 O 3-x ), only hydroxide (In 2 O 3 (OH) y ) and both O vacancy and hydroxide (In 2 O 3-x (OH) y ) defects, shown in Figure 1b, Figure 1c and Figure 1d, respectively.Previously, this approach has been effectively used to characterize and study the structural, electronic and optical properties of a wide variety of surfaces such as TiO 2 (110), ZnO(1000), CuCl(111) and V 2 O 5 (010). 23,15,2526627 The (111) termination for the In 2 O 3 surface was chosen since it is the most favored termination thermodynamically 28 and also corresponds well with surfaces observed in the experimental samples, as discussed in our previous study. 10ll indium oxide clusters were terminated using pseudohydrogen saturators having appropriately chosen classical point charges at the same coordinates (see details in the Supporting Information).These models were further tested and validated by probing the convergence of the optical properties with respect to the size of the cluster by studying absorption spectra of 120 atoms (In 9 O 33 H1 78 ), 80 atoms (In 5 O 21 H1 54 ) and 64 atoms (In 4 O 17 H1 43 ) bulk-like clusters, Figure S3).Almost no dependence of the optical band gap on the cluster size was observed.Moreover, since the bulk and surface clusters have different saturation of the bordering In and O atoms, by comparing the absorption spectra of the bulk cluster model with the surface cluster model (Figure S1a and S1b) we are probing the convergence of optical properties with the method of saturation.Furthermore, the optical properties of the surface cluster were also found to be in good agreement with the experimental data obtained for In 2 O 3-x (OH) y samples (Figure S1d).This indicates that the accuracy of the local description of the potential is more important than the inclusion of long-range effects and that these saturated cluster models can be used to correctly mimic the properties of pristine and defected forms of In 2 O 3 . Structural Changes during Light Activation for Pristine and Defected Surfaces.The geometric structures for all four surfaces, In 2 O 3 , In 2 O 3-x , In 2 O 3 (OH), and In 2 O 3-x (OH) y , were fully optimized for the GS by the DFT method and for the ES by the TDDFT method.Some salient bond lengths and bond angles for these surface clusters in the GS and ES are listed in Table S1 in the Supporting Information.Structural analysis for the pristine surface cluster shows a slight geometric contraction of the surface structure in the presence of light.In contrast, the surface containing only an O vacancy defect shows a slight expansion in the ES.However, when a surface O is replaced with OH, the system behaves similarly to the pristine In 2 O 3 surface, and shows contraction in the presence of light.Thus, adding an extra H (of OH) does not seem to disturb the structure as much as when an O is taken out of the pristine surface.Interestingly, the structure of the surface having both O vacancy and OH defects is not significantly influenced by light.All InIn distances remain almost unchanged in the ES for the In 2 O 3-x (OH) y structure; while the bond length of the hydroxyl group is slightly decreased from 1.015 to 0.998 A and the neighboring In-OH distance is lengthened by 0.004 A in the ES.Although small, these spatial changes brought by defect interactions with light could be associated with the change in reaction mechanism from GS to ES, resulting in a lower activation barrier for CO 2 reduction in the light compared to the dark, as discussed in the following sections. Absorption Spectra.To investigate the role of light on optical properties, UV-visible absorption spectra were computed for pristine In 2 O 3 and defected In 2 O 3-x , In 2 O 3 (OH) y , and In 2 O 3-x (OH) y surfaces as shown in Figure 2, where the vertical lines denote the corresponding excitation energies and oscillator strengths.The oscillator strengths were determined to express the intensities of transitions between two states.The calculated energies and oscillator strengths of the lowest-lying transitions for all the surfaces are tabulated in Table 1. The low-energy absorption band for the pristine In 2 O 3 surface (Figure 2a) mainly consists of two transitions, viz. the S0 S1 and S0 S2 transitions at 3.34 and 3.37 eV, respectively.The S1 and S2 states are nearly degenerate with the S0 S1 transition, involving the promotion of an electron from the bonding highest-occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) into the lowest-unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO); and, the S0 S2 transition involving the promotion of an electron from the HOMO-1 into the LUMO.In these TDDFT calculations, the HOMO of the pristine In 2 O 3 surface can be considered to correspond to the valence band maximum (VBM) of the material and the LUMO to correspond to the conduction band minimum (CBM).The main contribution to the absorption band for the pristine surface is due to the S0 S16 transition at 5.48 eV with maximum oscillator strength of 0.109. In contrast to the above, the surface containing only O vacancy defects (In 2 O 3-x ) shows a sharp peak with oscillator strength of 0.285 in the visible region (Figure 2b).Here, the absorption band mainly consists of three transitions: the S0 S1, S0 S2, and S0 S3 transitions at 2.88, 2.98, and 3.08 eV, respectively.It is found that the first transition is mainly due to the promotion of an electron from HOMO to LUMO1 and LUMO2.The intense absorption associated with these first three transitions masks the contributions of the rest of the transitions, whose oscillator strengths are negligible.In contrast to the O vacancy only In 2 O 3-x surface, the hydroxide only In 2 O 3 (OH) y surface shows no noticeable peaks in the visible region due to the presence of hydroxide groups (Figure 2c).In fact, the first nine excited states show negligible oscillator strengths for this surface, signifying that these transitions do not contribute to absorption spectra.The first noticeable absorption band for the In 2 O 3 (OH) y surface is due to the S0 S10 transition at 3.37 eV (oscillator strength 0.0134), which is similar to the first absorption band of pristine In 2 O 3 surface.This might be due to the minimal distortion of the surface by substitution of O with OH.It is found that this transition is mainly due to promotion of electrons from HOMO-1 to LUMO1.Thus, unlike other surfaces studied herein, the In 2 O 3 (OH) y surface shows no significant con-tribution to its first significant absorption band arising from charge transfer from HOMO to LUMO. In Figure 2d, the absorption spectra for In 2 O 3-x (OH) y surface containing both O vacancy and OH by contrast shows three well-defined peaks at 1.55, 1.95, and 2.13 eV with oscillator strengths of 0.133, 0.159, and 0.196 due to the S0 S1, S0 S2, and S0 S3 transitions, respectively.Further analysis reveals that these three transitions are due to the promotion of electrons from HOMO to LUMO, HOMO to LUMO1, and HOMO to LUMO2, respectively.The contributions of the rest of the transitions and their intensities are observed to be negligible. It is important to note that in the experimental absorbance spectrum of In 2 O 3-x (OH) y in Figure S1d, no peaks are visible in the region corresponding to energies less than 2.9 eV.This indicates that the primary optical transitions from the valence band maximum (VBM) to the conduction band minimum (CBM) for In 2 O 3-x (OH) y can be described by the HOMO to LUMO transitions in the pristine In 2 O 3 surface.However, the In 2 O 3-x (OH) y cluster model containing both O vacancy and OH defects predicts HOMO to LUMO transitions to occur at energies of 1.55, 1.95, and 2.13 eV, which would fall within the fundamental band gap of In 2 O 3 .However, the creation of midgap states by the introduction of O vacancy and OH defects in indium oxide materials is consistent with other reports found in the literature 29,30 and in our previous work, we demonstrated the presence of both of these defects in our photocatalytically active In 2 O 3-x (OH) y material. 10,18The absence of visible light absorption in the experimental In 2 O 3-x (OH) y spectrum is likely due to several factors.First, in our experimental In 2 O 3-x (OH) y material the concentration of O vacancy and hydroxide defects is relatively small compared to the overall defect-free crystalline regions.Therefore, the defect-free absorption likely dominates, which could explain why our experimental absorption more closely resembles the pristine surface.Indeed Lei et al. have demonstrated the effect of O vacancy concentration on the absorption spectrum of indium oxide samples. 30heir results illustrate that only at high O vacancy concentration is a substantial visible absorption observed, while at low O vacancy concentration, the absorption spectrum more closely resemble the bulk absorption spectrum of indium oxide.Further, if optical transitions from these midgap states are short-lived, it would result in signal broadening, making it more difficult to detect by standard steady-state absorption spectroscopy, 31 particularly if the signal was small to begin with. In order to confirm the existence of these proposed midgap states to further validate this model, we used transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy, which is a sensitive technique that uses a high-intensity laser excitation source and is able to detect very short-lived excited state transitions.In TA spectroscopy, an ultrafast, single-wavelength laser pump pulse is used to put the sample into an excited state by promoting electrons from the valence band to the conduction band, creating electron-hole pairs.These excited state charge carriers rapidly relax to the bottom of the conduction band or top of the valence band and can begin to populate midgap defect states, typically within 1 ps after light is absorbed. 3233334 This first laser pump pulse is then followed by a second broad band laser probe pulse, which measures the excited state absorption spectra of the sample at different time delays (1-1000 ps) after the initial excitation. Figure 3 shows the TA spectra of the photoactive In 2 O 3-x (OH) y nanocrystal sample at different time delays between pump and probe pulses.There are two distinct regions observed.The negative change in absorbance (A) for wavelengths corresponding to energies above the band gap (2.9 eV), relating to the ground-state absorption of the In 2 O 3-x (OH) y nanocrystals, is called the ground-state bleach.This is associated with state-filling resulting from the initial excitation of the In 2 O 3-x (OH) y nanocrystals from the ground state to the excited state.Because these spectra are plotted relative to the original absorption spectrum, this reduction in the number of charge carriers in the ground state due to the first laser pump pulse results in less absorption observed using the probe pulse, and therefore a negative A signal.On the other hand, wavelengths corresponding to energies below the band gap (2.9 eV) do not appear to contribute substantially to the ground state absorption.The positive A in these regions of the spectra are therefore associated with secondary excitation of the already photoexcited charge carriers to higher energy states due to the probe pulse.This positive photoinduced A depends on the number of photogenerated charge carriers present and the coupling efficiency between the initial and final states. 3536637 From the TA spectra it is apparent that a broad distribution of transitions are occurring that correspond to energies below the band gap of indium oxide.In TA studies of similar, ligand-free, defected metal oxides (e.g., TiO 2 , ZnO), a positive A in the visible region is typically assigned to transitions from electrons and holes populating midgap states created by surface and bulk defects. 33,38399404142 O vacancy defects generally have been shown to behave as electron traps and give rise to TA signals around 1.8 eV, 33,39 while hydroxide groups are often considered to create hole traps that produce TA signals around 2.4 eV. 43Signals in the near-infrared (1.5 eV) are generally attributed to transitions from defect states, particularly surface oxygen vacancies, into the conduction band. 33,394004142 It should be noted that energy values of these TA optical transitions, which are the result of secondary excitation from pump-probe measurements, cannot be directly correlated to the direct HOMO to LUMO transitions in the computational models, however their presence, combined with literature precedent, provides compelling evidence for the presence of midgap defect states predicted by the theoretical In 2 O 3-x (OH) y cluster model.Further it is apparent that contributions to the TA spectra from these midgap states is only significant within the first 1000 ps, indicating that charges populating these midgap states very rapidly relax back to the ground state, which would result in signal broadening, further helping to explain the absence of visible absorption in the steady-state absorption spectra. In order to provide further evidence of the presence of optically active midgap defect states in our In 2 O 3-x (OH) y sample, we conducted photoconductivity measurements.A film of the In 2 O 3-x (OH) y nanoparticles was layered with silver electrodes with a period spacing of 0.5 mm and 4 point probe measurements were conducted.As shown in Figure 3b, the EQE spectrum shows an appreciable tail of conductance from energy levels above 2.3eV and an additional weak contribution around 1.9-2.0eV.As illustrated in the inset of Figure 3b, this indicates that electrons with energies above 1.9 eV are excited from the valence band or populated defect states into a continuum of states within the band gap from where they are able to thermally hop to the conduction mobility edge.The slow photoconductivity change with time (right inset of Figure 3b) shows that photogenerated carriers undergo significant recombination and regeneration before reaching photosaturation; and when the light is turned off, trapped carriers in deep states are slow to relax. 44It is possible that midgap states from 1.9-2.2eV which overlap with the exponential band tail enable electron conduction (see left inset of Figure 3b) however the number of photogenerated carriers participating in conduction may be restricted by the percolation pathway giving rise to a weaker photoconductivity change than that measured for states from 2.3-2.7 eV.It is also possible that midgap states themselves provide a conduction pathway between nanoparticles. 45While further investigation is required to determine the exact conductivity mechanisms, these measurements further support the existence of deep to midgap defect states in the In 2 O 3-x (OH) y sample, corresponding well with what has been predicted theoretically. Molecular Orbital and Transition Density Analysis.To analyze the charge transfer properties due to excitations for a complex system of the type described herein, the most commonly used method is analysis of the molecular orbitals (MOs) involved in the electronic transition.Based on the calculated electronic excitation energies, the photoexcitation is expected to electronically excite In 2 O 3 to the S1 and S2, In 2 O 3-x to S1, In 2 O 3 (OH) y to S10 and In 2 O 3-x (OH) y to S1, S2 and S3 states.These first few excited states also possess considerable intensity in the visible range and are therefore analyzed further using MOs involved in these excitations.To explicitly illustrate the nature of the charge distribution associated with these excitations, we also computed the transition densities (TD) as described later in this section. Figure 4a shows the dominant MO contributors for the S0 S1 and S0 S2 excitations of the pristine In 2 O 3 surface.These lowest energy transitions are dominated by charge transfer excitation from the HOMO and HOMO-1, which are associated with surface O atoms, to the LUMO which are associated mainly with In atoms.It should be noted that this HOMO and LUMO character of the finite cluster model considered here is similar to that reported for the slab model 10,46 indicating that our model contains the necessary ingredients to capture the essential physics of this system.Further, the TD distribution for the pristine surface depicted in Figure 5a shows that almost all the In and O atoms of the cluster contribute to electron-hole pairs for the S1 excited state, indicating the nature of the delocalized charge contribution, where the O atoms act as donor and In atoms act as acceptors. The calculated absorption spectrum (Figure 2b) showed intensities at lower energies for the surface with only O vacancy defects.The dominant MOs contributing to the first significant (S0 S1) excitation responsible for this visible absorption are shown in Figure 4b.It can be seen that the S0 S1 transition is dominated by charge transfer from the HOMO, which is mainly associated with excess charge on the surface due to the O vacancy, to the LUMO1 and LUMO2, which is delocalized mainly around the In sites.Further, the TD for the In 2 O 3-x surface displayed in Figure 5b shows that the charge dynamics are much more localized around the O vacancy.Most of the charge accumulation and depletion occurs in the vicinity of the O vacancy and the In atoms bonded to it, with a smaller amount of charge accumulation reaching the more distant In atoms.This is in stark contrast to the excitation in the pristine In 2 O 3 surface, which is far more delocalized. As discussed earlier, the absorbance intensities of the first nine lowest energy excitations for the In 2 O 3 (OH) y surface are found to be negligible.The dominant MO contributions to the first five excitations are given in Table 1.In Figure 4c, we represent the charge transfer process for the S0 S10 transition at 3.37 eV, which is found to be responsible for the first significant absorption band, Figure 2c Figure 6a, 6b, 6c display the MO contributors to the S0 S1, S0 S2, and S0 S3 transitions of the In 2 O 3-x (OH) y surface, respectively.Table 1 shows that out of these three transitions, S0 S3 transition has the maximum oscillator strength and therefore will be responsible for the overall charge distribution.The S0 S1, S0 S2 and S0 S3 transitions are dominated by charge transfer excitation from HOMO to LUMO, HOMO to LUMO1, and HOMO to LUMO2, respectively.As shown in these figures, the HOMO of the In 2 O 3-x (OH) y surface is mainly associated with s and p orbitals of the surface In atom (In2, Figure 1) with a small contribution from the s orbitals of the O atoms of the surface and the OH group; whereas, LUMO, LUMO1, LUMO2 are associated mainly with s and p orbitals of In atoms of the cluster, s orbitals of O atoms of the cluster, and s orbitals of O of the OH group.Therefore, these transitions redistribute the charge to make the surface coordinately unsaturated In atom neighboring to an OH electron-deficient and the OH species itself electron-rich, leading to a more Lewis acidic and Lewis basic FLP site on the In 2 O 3-x (OH) y surface.Furthermore, the TD of the first three absorption bands of the In 2 O 3-x (OH) y surface, Figure 6, illustrates that the nature of the S1, S2, and S3 excited states remains delocalized as compared to other defected surfaces, and involves donor and acceptor orbitals on many O and In atoms including the O of the OH group.In fact, the charge is well delocalized over half of the cluster atoms which contribute significantly to each excitation similar to the case of the pristine surface.This favors easy electron transport on the These charge analyses also show that the substantial OH character is present in the HOMO of In 2 O 3-x (OH) y but is absent in the LUMO.This means that in the presence of light, electrons are transferred from OH to In for the less intense, S0 S1 transition.In other words, if we consider OH groups behaving as ligands, charge transfer on the In 2 O 3-x (OH) y surface has ligand-to-metal charge-transfer (LMCT) character associated with the S0 S1 transition, in addition to the metalto-ligand charge-transfer (MLCT) character arising from the S0 S2 and S0 S3 transitions.Furthermore, since the oscillator strengths of S0 S2 and S0 S3 transitions due to MLCT is more intense than S0 S1 transition due to LMCT, there will be an overall increase in electronic charge on OH and a decrease in electronic charge on the coordinatively unsaturated surface In atom.Thus, as illustrated in Figure 7, in the presence of light, the In 2 O 3-x (OH) y surface becomes photoactive due to charge delocalization that enhances the Lewis acidic and Lewis basic character of InInOH surface FLPs.This highly active excited state FLP surface destabilizes the reactant state and raises its total energy, which could explain the experimentally observed decrease in the activation barrier of CO 2 reduction by 20 kJ mol -1 in the light compared to the dark. 10"

Such behavior was not found to occur for the other defected surfaces containing only O vacancies or only hydroxides.Transient absorption spectroscopy and photoconductivity measurements successfully validated the TDDFT computed absorption spectra of In 2 O 3-x (OH) y and confirmed the existence of visible and near-infrared transitions associated with midgap states created by the inclusion of O vacancy and OH defects within the cluster.From the molecular orbital and the transition density analyses of the embedded cluster models, the importance of the O vacancy and OH defects in excited state transitions was revealed.These analyses showed that these light-induced electronic transitions were delocalized on In and O atoms for both pristine In 2 O 3 and defected In 2 O 3-x (OH) y surfaces, whereas for defected In 2 O 3-x and In 2 O 3 (OH) y surfaces, they were localized over their respective defects.In particular, it was found that the population of low lying energy states associated with the In 2 O 3-x (OH) y surface enhance the Lewis acidic and Lewis basic character respectively of coordinately unsaturated proximal In and InOH surface FLP sites, which provides the fundamental reason behind the experimentally observed reduction in the activation barrier by about 20 kJ/mol for the gas-phase reaction of H 2 and CO 2 to form CO and H 2 O in the presence of light compared to the dark.ASSOCIATED CONTENT S Supporting InformationThe Supporting Information is available free of charge on the ACS Publications website at DOI: 10.1021/jacs.5b10179.Cluster model, diffraction pattern for experimental sample and validation of theoretical model.(PDF) AUTHOR INFORMATIONCorresponding Authors TDDFT Results for the Five Lowest-Lying Excited Singlet States for Pristine In 2 O 3 and Defected In 2 O 3-x , In 2 O 3 (OH) y and In 2 O 3-x (OH) y Surfaces: Excitation Energy (EE) (eV), Oscillator Strengths (OS) and the Dominant Orbital Transitions Contributions (dom.OT contr.) a a H, HOMO; L, LUMO.
