    "content": "CO 2 photoreduction with water vapor has been studied on three TiO 2 nanocrystal polymorphs (anatase, rutile, and brookite) that were engineered with defect-free and oxygen-deficient surfaces, respectively.It was demonstrated that helium pretreatment of the as-prepared TiO 2 at a moderate temperature resulted in the creation of surface oxygen vacancies (V O ) and Ti 3 sites on anatase and brookite but not on rutile.The production of CO and CH 4 from CO 2 photoreduction was remarkably enhanced on defective anatase and brookite TiO 2 (up to 10-fold enhancement) as compared to the defect-free surfaces.Defective brookite was photocatalytically more active than anatase and rutile, probably due to a lower formation energy of V O on brookite.The results from in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) analyses suggested that (1) defect-free TiO 2 was not active for CO 2 photoreduction since no CO 2 -is generated, and(2) CO 2 photoreduction to CO possibly underwent different reaction pathways on oxygendeficient anatase and brookite via different intermediates (e.g., CO 2 -on anatase; CO 2 -and HCOOH on brookite).The combined DRIFTS and photoactivity studies reported in this paper have provided new insights to the role of surface defects in CO 2 photoreduction on TiO 2 nanocrystals, and revealed significant information on the much less studied but promising brookite phase."

    "content": "All IR spectra presented in this work were recorded on a Nicolet 6700 spectrometer (Thermo Electron) equipped with a liquid nitrogen cooled HgCdTe (MCT) detector.The spectra were displayed in absorbance units, and acquired with a resolution of 4 cm -1 , using 32 scans.The in situ DRIFTS studies were performed in a Praying Mantis DRIFTS accessory and a reaction chamber (Harrick Scientific, HVC-DRP), as shown in Figure 1.The dome of the cell has two KBr windows allowing IR transmission and a third quartz window allowing transmission of irradiation introduced through a liquid light guide (Newport) that connects to a 450 W Xe arc system (Oriel).The light spectrum of the Xe lamp can be found in our previous work. 10 TiO 2 nanocrystals in three phases were selectively prepared by hydrolysis and hydrothermal methods according to the literature. 15,35 o synthesize rutile TiO 2 , titanium tetrachloride (TiCl 4 ) was added dropwise into ethanol under stirring.A transparent yellowish sol was formed, and then slowly added to distilled water under stirring.The molar ratio of TiCl 4 , ethanol, and water was 2:20:280.After the addition was finished, the solution was further stirred for 30 min, and then was maintained in a closed system at 50 C in an oven for 24 h.The white precipitate was harvested by centrifugation, and washed with distilled water and dried in an oven at 50 C. To prepare anatase TiO 2 , 10 mL of titanium bis(ammonium lactate) dihydroxide (TALH) aqueous solution (50 ) and a desired amount of 0.1 M urea were mixed followed by the addition of distilled water to reach a final volume of 100 ml.The resulting solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave, which was sealed and placed in an electric oven held at 160 C for 24 h.Then, the autoclave was naturally cooled in air.The precipitates were separated by centrifugation, washed with distilled water until pH 7, and dried overnight at 60 C in an oven.To prepare brookite TiO 2 , a similar procedure was performed but the concentration of urea was changed to 7 M.All three powders were calcined at 400 C for 3 h at a heating rate of 2 C/min. To prepare oxygen-deficient TiO 2 , the as-prepared TiO 2 samples were pretreated inside the DRIFT reaction cell (for investigation of CO 2 and H 2 O interaction on TiO 2 surface) or inside the photoreactor (for activity tests of CO 2 photoreduction with H 2 O) at 220 C for 1.5 h with a flow of He (99.999, 120 ml/min).The unpretreated and He pre-treated TiO 2 samples were denoted as Ti(UP) and Ti (He), respectively, and the three polymorphs, i.e., anatase, brookite, and rutile, were denoted as TiA(UP), TiB(UP), TiR(UP), TiA(He), TiB (He) and TiR(He), respectively. The surface area, pore size and pore volume of the unpretreated and pretreated TiO 2 samples were analyzed by nitrogen adsorption at 77 K with the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method (Micromeritics, ASAP 2020).The crystal structures of the unpretreated and pretreated TiO 2 were identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Scintag XDS 2000) using Cu K irradiation at 45 kV and a diffracted beam monochromator at 40 mA.The crystal size of TiO 2 was calculated using the Scherer equation.Raman spectroscopy was carried out on a Renishaw 1000B system in the range of 100-1500 cm -1 .The lattice structures of individual nanocrystals were visualized by phasecontrast high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) carried out with 300 keV electrons in a Hitachi H9000NAR instrument with 0.18 nm point and 0.11 nm lattice resolution. Amplitude contrast TEM images were used to obtain information about the sizes and morphology.UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-vis DRS) were obtained by a UV-visible spectrometer (Ocean Optics) using BaSO 4 as the background.The state of Ti on TiO 2 samples was identified with DRIFTS by examining the characteristic Ti-OH bonds. In situ DRIFTS spectra of CO 2 photoreduction with H 2 O vapor were recorded for unpretreated and in situ pretreated anatase and brookite TiO 2 samples.In the cases of TiA(UP) and TiB(UP), each sample was purged with He for 1 h at 25 C, and a background spectrum in the presence of the sample was collected.After that, 10CO 2 /He (99.999,Praxair) was continuously passed through a water bubble to bring a mixture of CO 2 and H 2 O vapor into the chamber at 2.0 ml/min for 15 min.Subsequently, the inlet and outlet valves of the DRIFTS reaction cell were closed, and the sample was subjected to photo-illumination for 90 min.In the cases of TiA(He) and TiB(He), the same procedure was used to obtain the IR spectra except that the sample underwent the previously described He-pretreatment process at 220 C and the DRIFTS reaction cell was allowed to cool down to 25 C before the IR spectra were taken. The experiments of CO 2 photoreduction with H 2 O on Ti(UP) and Ti (He) were carried out in a photoreactor similar to that reported in our previous study. 10CO 2 (99.999,Praxair) was continuously passed through a water bubbler to allow a mixture of CO 2 and H 2 O vapor (H 2 O 2.3 v/v) to traverse the photocatalyst-loaded glass fiber filter inside the photoreactor.A 150 W solar simulator (Oriel) was used as the excitation source, and the spectrum is shown in Figure S1. The light intensity of the solar simulator was 90 mW/cm 2 in the range of 200 -1000 nm.As compared to the AM 1.5G standard, the solar simulator had a higher intensity in the UV range (200 400 nm), but a lower intensity in the visible range (400 800 nm).The photoreactor was operated in a continuous-flow mode (2.0 ml/min flow rate), and the gaseous products in the reactor effluent were continuously analyzed for 6 h by a gas chromatograph (GC, Agilent 7890A) equipped with both a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and flame ionization detector (FID).For each test, 100 mg of TiO 2 was used.For the Ti(He) samples, after the in situ pretreatment, the reactor was naturally cooled down to room temperature before the subsequent photoactivity measurement was conducted. The crystal structures of the prepared materials were confirmed by XRD and Raman spectroscopy.detected by the HRTEM analyses shown in a later section of this paper.In addition, TiR(UP) and TiB(UP) exhibited similar crystal sizes (11.5 and 11.0 nm, respectively), which were slightly larger than that of TiA(UP) (8.0 nm) (See Table 1).Figure 2b shows the XRD patterns of the pretreated TiO 2 samples.The diffraction peaks and crystal sizes of TiB (He) and TiR(He) (10.9 and 11.8 nm, respectively) were almost identical to those of TiB(UP) and TiR(UP).The TiA (He) sample remained as a pure anatase phase material.The diffraction peaks of TiA(He) appeared to be sharper than that of TiA(UP) as the crystal size of TiA(He) slightly increased from 8.0 to 8.8 nm (see Table 1).These results indicated that neither the crystal phases nor the crystal sizes of TiO 2 were significantly influenced by the He pretreatment at a moderate temperature (220 C). In agreement with XRD results, Raman spectra of TiA(UP) and TiR(UP) in Figure 2c exhibited five characteristic Raman-active modes for anatase and three for the rutile phase. 16,36 rich scenario of signals on TiB(UP) were related to the 36 Raman-active modes of a typical brookite phase, similar to the natural and artificial brookite. 15,16,36,37 Moeover, comparison with the Raman spectra of TiA(UP) and TiB(UP) showed a shift from 142.4 cm -1 for anatase to 151.8 cm -1 for brookite and the appearance of a shoulder at 127.6 cm -1 . 15The multiple-peaks and the Raman shift further confirmed the high purity of the as-prepared brookite phase. Table 1 also compares the measured BET surface area, pore size and pore volume of the unpretreated TiO 2 with He-pretreated samples.For the unpretreated TiO 2 , TiA(UP) had the highest BET specific surface area (145.6 m 2 /g), almost twice as much as that of TiB(UP) and three times as much as that of TiR(UP).TiB(UP) displayed the largest pore size and pore volume, probably due to its nanocrystals' unique rod-shaped morphology that is described later in this paper.For the He-pretreated TiO 2 samples, the surface areas of TiA (He) and TiB (He) slightly increased while their average pore size and pore volume slightly decreased as compared to those of TiA(UP) and TiB(UP).By contrast, TiR(He) had a slightly decreased surface area but comparable pore size and pore volume as that of TiR(UP).These slight variations are likely attributed to the experimental uncertainties in BET measurements as well as the sampling errors from different batches of materials.On the other hand, the crystal sizes of the samples with and without He-pretreatment were very close.The results demonstrate that He treatment at a moderate temperature (220 o C) had only a minor effect on the textural properties of the three polymorphs. Since the XRD results showed that the crystal sizes and phases of TiO 2 were not significantly changed after He treatment at a moderate temperature, the particle sizes and morphologies of the pretreated and unpretreated samples were expected to be similar.Thus, only the pretreated Ti (He) samples were analyzed by TEM and HRTEM.For TiA (He), the TEM image in Figure 3a shows aggregates of fine nanoparticles, while the HRTEM image in Figure 3b clearly shows a wellfaceted crystal with an interplanar spacing of around 0.350 nm that matches the anatase phase (101) plane. 10The anatase particles are irregularly shaped hexagons, circles or rectangles with an average size of 9 nm.For TiR(He), short nanoellipses can be observed on the edges of the aggregated flower-like structures in Figure 3c.However, the elliptical rods with diameters of 20 nm are randomly oriented.According to the HRTEM observations in Figure 3d, the interplanar spacing of 0.322 nm between the adjacent lattices corresponds to the distance between the (110) crystal plane of the rutile phase. 35,38 shown in Figure 3e, the nanorod-shaped TiB(He) was randomly dispersed with a length of approximate 100 nm and a diameter of 20 nm.The HRTEM image in Figure 3f shows clear onedimensional lattice fringes of TiO 2 (lattice spacing 0.344 nm) that is very close to the brookite TiO 2 (111) lattice spacing of 0.346 nm. 10,15 he nanorods also consisted of a short-range ordered phase with a mean interplanar spacing of 0.544 nm, which coincides with the distance between octahedron chains in brookite along the 001 axis. 38In addition to the (111) and (001) planes, other families of facets are identifiable (See Figure S2), such as the (202)-type surfaces and the kinematically forbidden (100) periodicities, 37 corresponding to lattice spacings of 0.227 and 0.921 nm, respectively.As shown in Figure 3f, some irregular shape particles with a smaller size ( 5 nm) were observed on the top or edge of the brookite nanorods, and those particles might be amorphous TiO 2 as their lattice structure is not discernable.and TiB(UP), respectively, close to the reported values of three phases TiO 2 . 15,35 y contrast, TiA (He) and TiB(He) display similar tails extending to a longer wavelength of 600 nm, while TiR(He) exhibits an almost identical absorption profile as that of TiR(UP).Both theoretical and experimental UV-vis DRS results in the literature indicated that in the case of oxygen-deficient TiO 2 , the broad band in the visible region of 450-600 nm was attributed to the light absorption of V O , which can effectively harvest visible light and create a color center. 19,26,39,40 Hece, the redshifts of TiA (He) and TiB(He) likely resulted from the formation of surface V O .Similar UV-vis DRS results were reported in our previous study indicating that thermal pretreatment in He caused the formation of V O on a Cu/TiO 2 (P25) sample. 27The almost identical absorption profiles of TiR(UP) and TiR (He) in this work indicated the absence of V O on the rutile phase.The existence of V O was further supported by the different colors of the Ti(UP) and Ti (He).The colors of the three original Ti(UP) samples were white.After He pretreatment, the color of the TiA(He) changed to brownish-gray and that of TiB(He) changed to gray (see the inset pictures in Figure 4), while TiR(He) remained white.Chen et al. 20 prepared hydrogen-reduced TiO 2 with a black color and they reported that the intrinsic defect disorders like V O and Ti interstitial on their sample caused such appearance.The color change of TiO 2 in this work directly supports the conclusion of V O formation on TiA (He) and TiB(He), whereas the three Ti(UP) samples and TiR(He) surface are relatively defect-free. A comparison of the DRIFTS spectra of unpretreated and He-pretreated samples in the range of 3000-3800 cm -1 was used to elucidate the existence of Ti 3 species.As shown in Figure 5a, similar IR bands at 3693 and 3000-3600 cm -1 exist on TiA(UP), TiR(UP) and TiB(UP).These bands are assigned to stretching vibration of H-bound OH groups and physically adsorbed H 2 O, respectively. 41,42 y contrast, for Ti(He) samples as shown in Figure 5b, the original 3693 and 3000-3600 cm -1 bands disappeared or became significantly weakened, probably due to the desorption of weakly bonded H 2 O.Meanwhile, new bands appeared at 3415, 3650, 3678 and 3720 cm -1 , where the former three bands were assigned to Ti 4 -OH and the latter one was assigned to Ti 3 -OH. 414224344 This confirms that thermal pre-treatment in He leads to the formation of Ti 3 on the Ti(He) surface due to the oxygen loss, which is in good agreement with the literature that indicated that annealing in an inert environment was likely to result in the partial reduction of Ti 4 to Ti 3 with the generation of surface V O simultaneously, i.e., Ti 4 -O-Ti 4 Ti 3 --Ti 3 2 1 O 2 . 18,19,22 O the other hand, the relative intensities of Ti 3 -OH on TiA (He) and TiB (He) are stronger than that on TiR(He).This difference suggested that the relative concentration of V O /Ti 3 sites was likely in the order of TiA(He) TiB(He) TiR (He), which is consistent with the previously presented UV-vis absorption results and the color differences noted for the three samples (Figure 4). Background tests were first conducted with a mixture of He H 2 O passing through the TiO 2 catalyst under photo-illumination; no carbon-containing products were detected.Photoreduction products (CO and CH 4 ) were observed only in the presence of CO 2 , confirming CO 2 was indeed the carbon source.CH 4 is a valuable product and can be directly used as a fuel.CO is also an important chemical feedstock and an essential component of synthetic gas or syngas, a mixture of H 2 and CO.Syngas can be further converted to liquid hydrocarbon fuels through well-known Fischer-Tropcsh processes. 1,45,46 N reaction carbon-containing products other than CO and CH 4 were detected by the GC/TCD-FID used in this work. By measuring the concentrations of CO and CH 4 at the reactor outlet, the production of CO and CH 4 , in mol g -1 , during a 6 hr photo-illumination period was calculated and the data are shown in Figure 6.TiB(He) had the highest CO production among all the tested samples, and 50 higher than TiA (He).TiA(He) had the highest CH 4 production, but only slightly higher than TiB (He).The rutile samples, pretreated or not, were the least active ones.Compared to the unpretreated samples, the activity of the He-pretreated samples was enhanced by 2.2, 10.3, and 3.9 times for CO production and by 13.3, 8.2, and 5 times for CH 4 production on anatase, brookite and rutile, respectively.It is clear that the factor of enhancement due to sample pretreatment was most significant on brookite (810 times), followed by anatase and rutile.The overall production of CO and CH 4 on TiB (He) and TiA(He) in this work was 18.9 and 12.8 mol g -1 , respectively, much higher than those reported in the literature using bare TiO 2 for CO 2 photoreduction.Koci et al. 5 reported a total production of CO, CH 4 and CH 3 OH about 2.9 mol g -1 after 8 hr photoreaction on an anatase TiO 2 sample.Dimitrijevec et al. 47 The measurement of possible O 2 production from H 2 O oxidation was investigated using pretreated brookite, i.e., TiB (He).Before turning on the UV-vis illumination, the photoreactor was purged with a CO 2 -H 2 O mixture flow to eliminate the air inside the reactor.However, there was always background O 2 and N 2 in the order of a few hundred ppm detected in the reactor effluent gas even after purging for a few hours.Hence, a better indicator of O 2 production by the catalyst during the photoreaction is the volumetric ratio of O 2 /N 2 in the effluent gas, as also suggested in our previous work. 10,13 igure 7 shows the O 2 /N 2 ratio before, during, and after the photoreaction, when gas sampling was conducted every 15 min.Before the photo-illumination (in the dark), the O 2 /N 2 ratio was steady.Interestingly, immediately upon photo-illumination, the O 2 /N 2 ratio dramatically decreased in the first 30 min and then gradually increased thereafter. This sharp decrease is possibly caused by the consumption of residual O 2 in the reactor through the reaction with photo-generated electrons O 2 e - O 2 -and consecutive reactions.generation process overweighed the previous mentioned concurrent O 2 consumption process, and thus, the net result was that the O 2 /N 2 ratio increased gradually with time and finally stabilized after 6 h when the generation/consumption processes reached equilibrium.When the light was turned off (the second dark period), an obvious drop in the O 2 /N 2 ratio was observed.This result again verified that there was O 2 generated during the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction process. The photoreduction data indicated that pretreated surfaces were more active that unpretreated ones.To further verify the role of V O /Ti 3 sites on the pretreated surface, in situ DRIFTS studies of CO 2 photoreduction with H 2 O were performed on defect-free TiA(UP) and TiB(UP), as well as defective TiA (He) and TiB (He). Figure 8 shows the IR spectra of CO 2 and H 2 O co-interaction with TiA(UP) and TiB(UP).In the dark, TiA(UP) and TiB(UP) surfaces were dominated by strongly adsorbed H 2 O at 1647 cm -1 , weak bicarbonate (HCO 3 -) features at 1420-1428 and 1221 cm -1 , and bidentate or monodentate carbonates (b-CO 3 , m-CO 3 2-) at 1500-1590 cm -1 . 31,32,36 ignificantly different results were obtained on TiA (He) and TiB(He) surfaces under the same experimental conditions.As shown in Figure 9a, exposure of TiA(He) to CO 2 and H 2 O in the dark led to the rapid formation of CO 2 -, HCO 3 -, and b-CO 3 2-species in the initial 0-5 minute timeframe.The formation of Ti 4 -CO 2 -indicates that an electron could be spontaneously attached to CO 2 from defective anatase even in the dark.The vibrational frequency of CO 2 -in this work (at 1670 and 1247 cm -1 ) correlated well with the experimental values reported in the literature 30,36 as well as the calculated values of CO 2 adsorbed on an oxygen-deficient anatase (101) plane. 24Prolonging the time to 15 min in the dark resulted in the disappearance of CO 2 and a gradual decrease of HCO 3 -and b-CO 3 2-, but an increase in the intensity of the H 2 O band. This result suggests that CO 2 and H 2 O may compete for the same defect sites; H 2 O could replace the adsorbed CO 2 -species and partially substitute HCO 3 -by occupying the V O /Ti 3 sites and OH groups.This replacement possibly results from the higher binding energy of H 2 O with TiO 2 than that of CO 2 . 21,24,29 Ahown in Figure 9b, photo-illumination apparently induced the re-appearance of CO 2 -(1675 and 1249 cm -1 ) on the TiA(He) surface.Meanwhile, the intensities of the IR spectral features for HCO 3 -(1415 and 1221 cm -1 ) and b-CO 3 2-(1583 and 1345 cm -1 ) increased with prolonged irradiation time, but that for adsorbed H 2 O decreased.This is a strong evidence that unlike TiA(UP), the TiA(He) surface allowed the photo-excited electrons that were trapped in the defect sites to transfer to the adsorbed CO 2 , although the literature indicates the difficulty or impossibility of one-electron reduction of CO 2 on TiO 2 . 2,47 o verify whether the spectral change (i.e., re-appearance of CO 2 -) could be caused by the re-adsorption of CO 2 by dehydration, an additional experiment was conducted under the following conditions in sequence: (1) pre-adsorption of H 2 O vapor on TiA(He) in the dark, (2) photo-irradiating the TiA(He) surface for 1 h, and (3) turning off the light and introducing CO 2 to TiA(He).It was found that photo-irradiation (step 2) led to surface dehydration to some extent (by observation of reduced H 2 O adsorption band intensity), but the subsequent CO 2 adsorption in the dark (step 3) on the dehydrated surface did not result in the occurrence of CO 2 -and HCO 3 -species.The above result verified that the re-appearance of CO 2 -in Figure 9b was due to the photo-induced activation and reduction of CO 2 but not due to the re-adsorption of CO 2 .These spectral changes in Figure 9 also suggest that the three carbon-containing species (CO 2 -, HCO 3 -and b-CO 3 2-) may be the primary intermediates on the treated anatase surface during the CO 2 photoreduction process, and H 2 O participates in the reaction with CO 2 by donating electrons or scavenging holes. Figure 10 shows CO 2 and H 2 O co-interaction with TiB(He) in the dark and under photoillumination.Similar to the features observed on TiA(He), H 2 O partially substituted the CO 2 -, HCO 3 -and CO 3 2-in the dark (Figure 10a), and photo-excitation of TiB(He) surface induced a remarkable reappearance of HCO 3 -with a concurrent slight decrease of H 2 O (Figure 10b). However, a reappearance of CO 2 -was not observed.Rather, two new bands at 1716 and 1379 cm -1 attributed to formic acid (HCOOH) 50 occurred under photo-illumination.This suggests that CO 2 -, HCO 3 -and HCOOH are possibly the major intermediates on the TiB(He) surface.It is also noted that a new broad band at 1495 cm -1 appeared on TiB(He) and its intensity increased with the irradiation time.The IR study of CO adsorption on Cu(I)/TiO 2 by Yang et al. 32 suggested that a similar band at 1492 cm -1 was indicative of CO adsorbed on Ti(O) sites as bicarbonates.Hence, this 1495 cm -1 band may originate from the adsorption of the CO product. Based on the photoactivity data and in situ DRIFTS observations, we proposed a tentative mechanism for CO and CH It is worth noting that unlike what occurs on TiA(He), CO 2 -was not present on TiB (He) under photo-illumination in the presence of H 2 O (Figure 10b).This is likely due to the faster reaction of CO 2 -with H (generated from H 2 O) to produce CO (Reaction 4) on TiB(He) than on TiA(He).This conclusion was supported by additional experimental results obtained under the condition where CO 2 in the absence of H 2 O vapor was allowed to interact with Ti(He) (see Figure S3).CO 2 -appeared on TiB(He) even without H 2 O vapor and its intensity increased with illumination time (Figure S3b).This may be a result of the photoreduction of adsorbed CO 2 with OH groups on the \"dry\" surface.The TiB(He) surface is favorable for adsorbed H 2 O (or OH groups or H species) to quickly scavenge CO 2 -and produce CO so that no CO 2 -could be observed on TiB(He) under illumination (Figure 10b).By contrast, the CO 2 -intensity on TiA(He) neither increased nor disappeared under illumination in the absence of H 2 O vapor (Figure S3a), suggesting a low reaction rate of CO 2 -with OH groups or H species on the TiA(He) surface.Furthermore, the photo-activity data (Figure 6) also indicate the superior activity of TiB(He) as compared to TiA(He) for CO production.Hence, the DRIFTS and photoactivity results correlate well with each other and clearly demonstrate that defective brookite is more active than anatase in facilitating the reaction of CO Regarding the reaction pathway for CH 4 formation, we propose that the carbon-containing intermediates such as CO, surface HCO 3 -and HCOOH may be converted to CH 4 via a multielectron transfer process, once dissociated hydrogen atoms are available (Reactions 7 and 11, Table 2). 13,14,45,47,52 It s also possible for CH 4 to decompose through reaction with photogenerated OH radicals to form CO. These two factors may contribute to the finding that the production of CH 4 was always lower than the production of CO determined in this work.Further investigation of the more complicated CH 4 formation mechanism involving an eight-electron transfer process will be in the scope of our future study. It is important to understand why the photoactivity for CO 2 reduction was enhanced on the defective surface.The effects of crystal structure, particle size and morphology can be excluded because the XRD, TEM, and HRTEM analyses did not indicate significant changes between the unpretreated and pretreated samples.Ultimately, the UV-vis, physical color and IR studies show apparent evidence for the formation of reactive V O /Ti 3 sites on Ti (He) It is noted that for unpretrated samples like TiA(UP) and TiB(UP), although CO 2 -was not detected under photo-illumination (Figure 8), their activity in CO 2 photoreduction was recorded by the GC measurement (Figure 6).The absence of CO 2 -in the DRIFTS measurement for the TiA(UP) and TiB(UP) samples may be because of two reasons.First, the catalyst area that was exposed to irradiation was approximately 40 times smaller in the DRIFTS reaction cell than in the flow reactor.Thus, a much smaller amount of CO 2 -was formed in the DRIFT cell.Second, the kinetics of CO 2 -transition to CO may be fast so that CO 2 -may not be detectable if in small quantity.The detection of CO 2 -on the pretreated samples, such as TiA(He), clearly reveals their higher activities in CO 2 photoreduction due to the presence of V O /Ti 3 defects. The surface area may have a minor effect on phase-dependent photoefficiency, since the activity of TiB(He) was higher than that of TiA(He) even though TiB(He) had a lower surface area (87.8 m 2 /g) than TiA(He) (163.8 m 2 /g, Table 1).There are two possible major reasons why the defective brookite phase resulted in higher combined production for CO and CH 4 as compared to the production using anatase and rutile.First, the results in Figures 4 and5 suggest that the relative concentration of V O /Ti 3 are comparable on the anatase and brookite surfaces, but are negligible on the rutile surface.This is in agreement with the theoretical results that the lower formation energy of V O on brookite (5.52 eV) and anatase (5.58 eV) may facilitate the creation of V O on these surfaces as compared to the rutile surface (5.82 eV). 23This difference accounts for the much higher activity on defective brookite and anatase than on rutile. Second, surface reaction intermediates may influence the photoactivity. 14Published studies proposed that the initial key step for the photoreduction of CO 2 was the formation of CO 2 intermediates. 24,30,33,51 Rako et al. 30 also demonstrated that a bent-CO 2 -was transformed into CO on pre-reduced Rh/TiO 2 .According to this analysis, the different behaviors of CO 2 -on TiO 2 may lead to a divergence in the activity between anatase and brookite.The mechanism discussion in Section 4.1 indicates that CO 2 -on TiB(He) is more likely to react with H than that on TiA (He), and that HCOOH is another possible intermediate on TiB (He).The added routes of HCOOH to CO and CH 4 may also contribute to the higher overall production of CO and CH 4 on defective brookite than on anatase. This work combined in situ DRIFTS and photoactivity measurements to comparatively study CO 2 photoreduction with H 2 O vapor on defect-free and oxygen-deficient TiO 2 nanocrystals.The photoactivity of defective TiO 2 was remarkably higher than that of defect-free TiO 2 .This enhancement was primarily attributed to the creation of oxygen vacancies and Ti 3 on the surface, which could promote CO 2 activation both in the dark and under photo-illumination by The brookite phase appears to be a promising material for CO 2 reduction, and therefore warrants further research along this topic, including the investigation of brookite-containing mixed phases.This work is currently underway. Figure 2a shows the XRD patterns of the as-prepared TiO 2 .TiA(UP) remains in the pure anatase phase (JCPDS No. 21-1272, tetragonal) at 25.3, 37.8 and 47.9 (2).The diffraction peaks of TiR(UP) at 27.5, 36.1, 41.2 and 54.4 (2) are well indexed to the typical rutile (JCPDS No. 21-1276, tetragonal).The XRD pattern of TiB(UP) shows the discernible brookite phase (JCPDS No. 29-1360, orthorhombic) from its unique and strong (121) diffraction located at 30.80 (2).Pure brookite was obtained, although a very small fraction of amorphous TiO 2 was Figure 4 compares the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra, displayed in absorbance units, of demonstrate the dissociation of H 2 O (Reaction 1) and the generation of CO 2 -(Reaction 2) and HCO 3 -(Reaction 3) intermediates on both the TiA(He) and TiB(He) surfaces.In agreement with the mechanism reported in the literature, 5, 30, 33, 47, 51 CO 2 -could be reduced to CO via reaction with H (Reaction 4) or self-transformation (Reaction 5), or direct dissociation by healing the V O sites (Reaction 6). Figure 1 Figure 3. TEM and HRTEM images for (a, b) TiA(He), (c, d) TiR(He), and (e, f) TiB(He). Figure 4.The UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectra of unpretreated and He-pretreated TiO 2 2 activation and reduction with H 2 O on a photo-excited TiO 2 surface also remains very important.The adsorption of CO 2 and H 2 O on TiO 2 is the preceding step of the photoreduction reactions; however, this important step has been scarcely studied.Only limited literature on the nature of CO 2 or H 2 O chemisorption on TiO 2 has been reported using either theoretical calculations for single crystal TiO 2 21, 24, 28, 29 or experimental measurements for powdered 3,5investigate the feasibility of H 2 and O 2 production during the process of CO 2 photoreduction with H 2 O, the concentration of H 2 and O 2 was monitored in a separate test using brookite as the catalyst.The possibility of H 2 production from H 2 O splitting by photoirradiation was tested by switching the GC carrier gas from He to N 2 or Ar to enhance the sensitivity for H 2 detection.However, no matter using N 2 or Ar as GC carrier gas, still no H 2 was detected on either unpretreated or pretreated brookite, although H 2 production is thermodynamically feasible in theory.This result agrees with our previous published results that no H 2 was formed on an iodine-doped TiO 2 catalyst during CO 2 photoreduction with H 2 O.10The literature also reported either no H 2 or trace H 2 production on bare TiO 2 , with concentrations of H 2 much smaller than those of the CO 2 reduction products.3,5TheH 2 production was prominent only in the presence of 49,48 metal co-catalysts (e.g., Pt, Ag)9,48or in the presence of sacrificial agents (e.g., CH 3 OH).20,48Arecentstudy49using a Pt/TiO 2 thin-film catalyst for CO 2 photoreduction with H 2 O reported only CO and CH 4 production without detection of H 2 .Based on the literature results and our findings, we believe the absence of H 2 production in this work is possibly due to the following reasons: (1) the lack of noble metal co-catalysts to lower the activation barrier for H 2 production; (2) protons or H radicals formed by the photo-dissociation of water is competitively consumed by CO 2 reduction intermediates like CO 2 -to produce CO and CH 4 ; and (3) the produced H 2 , if any, can be consumed by backward reactions with CO or O 2 . 13,14The gradual increase in the O 2 /N 2 ratio after the 30 min photo-illumination suggested the generation of O 2 through oxidation of H 2 O by photo-generated holes, H 2 O 2h 2H 2 1 O 2 .This O 2 Under subsequent photo-illumination, the IR features for CO 2 -related species and H 2 O were almost identical to those in the dark, even after 60 minutes of illumination.No CO 2 -or other new species were formed, and the adsorbed H 2 O was stable, indicating the difficulty in activating CO 2 and H 2 O on irradiated TiA(UP) and TiB(UP). 4 formation from CO 2 photoreduction with H 2 O on defective anatase and brookite TiO 2 , as expressed in Reactions 1-11 in Table 2.The IR results in Figures 9 and 10 2 -with H 2 O.In addition, IR results in Figures 9 and 10 show the formation of HCOOH on TiB(He) but not on TiA(He).HCOOH may originate from the reaction of CO 2 or CO 2 -with two H and electrons (Reactions 8 and 9, Table 2).Ulagappan et al. 50pointed out that HCOOH, generated by CO 2 photo-reaction with methanol on Ti-silica sieve, could be photodissociated into CO and H 2 O. Similar dissociation of HCOOH to CO may occur on the TiB(He) surface (Reaction 10, .This unique reaction on TiB(He) indicates that CO 2 photoreduction to CO probably undergoes different mechanisms on defective anatase and brookite phases through different surface.In situ DRIFTS results in Figures 8-10 demonstrate the more favorable formation of briged-CO 2 -, HCO 3 -or HCOOH and the dissociation of H 2 O on oxygen-deficient Ti(He) rather than on defect-free Ti(UP), which confirms that the V O /Ti 3 defects, as \"local factors\", could readily provide reactive sites for the adsorption of reactants and allow effective charge or hole transfer between CO 2 /H 2 O and the TiO 2-x surface under photo-illumination. generating CO 2 -intermediates.Another important finding was that for TiO 2 surfaces engineered with defect sites, brookite, the least studied structure among the three TiO 2 polymorphs, had the highest yield for CO and CH 4 production, followed by anatase and rutile.Possible reasons for this superior activity of defective brookite include the facilitated formation of oxygen vacancies, faster reaction rate of CO 2 -with adsorbed H 2 O or surface OH groups, and an additional reaction route involving an HCOOH intermediate.This study has provided new information to correlate the surface chemistry (defect sites, reaction intermediates) with CO 2 reduction activity by TiO 2 .

    "content": "The crystal structures of the prepared materials were confirmed by XRD and Raman spectroscopy.detected by the HRTEM analyses shown in a later section of this paper.In addition, TiR(UP) and TiB(UP) exhibited similar crystal sizes (11.5 and 11.0 nm, respectively), which were slightly larger than that of TiA(UP) (8.0 nm) (See Table 1).Figure 2b shows the XRD patterns of the pretreated TiO 2 samples.The diffraction peaks and crystal sizes of TiB (He) and TiR(He) (10.9 and 11.8 nm, respectively) were almost identical to those of TiB(UP) and TiR(UP).The TiA (He) sample remained as a pure anatase phase material.The diffraction peaks of TiA(He) appeared to be sharper than that of TiA(UP) as the crystal size of TiA(He) slightly increased from 8.0 to 8.8 nm (see Table 1).These results indicated that neither the crystal phases nor the crystal sizes of TiO 2 were significantly influenced by the He pretreatment at a moderate temperature (220 C). In agreement with XRD results, Raman spectra of TiA(UP) and TiR(UP) in Figure 2c exhibited five characteristic Raman-active modes for anatase and three for the rutile phase. 16,36 rich scenario of signals on TiB(UP) were related to the 36 Raman-active modes of a typical brookite phase, similar to the natural and artificial brookite. 15,16,36,37 Moeover, comparison with the Raman spectra of TiA(UP) and TiB(UP) showed a shift from 142.4 cm -1 for anatase to 151.8 cm -1 for brookite and the appearance of a shoulder at 127.6 cm -1 . 15The multiple-peaks and the Raman shift further confirmed the high purity of the as-prepared brookite phase. Table 1 also compares the measured BET surface area, pore size and pore volume of the unpretreated TiO 2 with He-pretreated samples.For the unpretreated TiO 2 , TiA(UP) had the highest BET specific surface area (145.6 m 2 /g), almost twice as much as that of TiB(UP) and three times as much as that of TiR(UP).TiB(UP) displayed the largest pore size and pore volume, probably due to its nanocrystals' unique rod-shaped morphology that is described later in this paper.For the He-pretreated TiO 2 samples, the surface areas of TiA (He) and TiB (He) slightly increased while their average pore size and pore volume slightly decreased as compared to those of TiA(UP) and TiB(UP).By contrast, TiR(He) had a slightly decreased surface area but comparable pore size and pore volume as that of TiR(UP).These slight variations are likely attributed to the experimental uncertainties in BET measurements as well as the sampling errors from different batches of materials.On the other hand, the crystal sizes of the samples with and without He-pretreatment were very close.The results demonstrate that He treatment at a moderate temperature (220 o C) had only a minor effect on the textural properties of the three polymorphs. Since the XRD results showed that the crystal sizes and phases of TiO 2 were not significantly changed after He treatment at a moderate temperature, the particle sizes and morphologies of the pretreated and unpretreated samples were expected to be similar.Thus, only the pretreated Ti (He) samples were analyzed by TEM and HRTEM.For TiA (He), the TEM image in Figure 3a shows aggregates of fine nanoparticles, while the HRTEM image in Figure 3b clearly shows a wellfaceted crystal with an interplanar spacing of around 0.350 nm that matches the anatase phase (101) plane. 10The anatase particles are irregularly shaped hexagons, circles or rectangles with an average size of 9 nm.For TiR(He), short nanoellipses can be observed on the edges of the aggregated flower-like structures in Figure 3c.However, the elliptical rods with diameters of 20 nm are randomly oriented.According to the HRTEM observations in Figure 3d, the interplanar spacing of 0.322 nm between the adjacent lattices corresponds to the distance between the (110) crystal plane of the rutile phase. 35,38 shown in Figure 3e, the nanorod-shaped TiB(He) was randomly dispersed with a length of approximate 100 nm and a diameter of 20 nm.The HRTEM image in Figure 3f shows clear onedimensional lattice fringes of TiO 2 (lattice spacing 0.344 nm) that is very close to the brookite TiO 2 (111) lattice spacing of 0.346 nm. 10,15 he nanorods also consisted of a short-range ordered phase with a mean interplanar spacing of 0.544 nm, which coincides with the distance between octahedron chains in brookite along the 001 axis. 38In addition to the (111) and (001) planes, other families of facets are identifiable (See Figure S2), such as the (202)-type surfaces and the kinematically forbidden (100) periodicities, 37 corresponding to lattice spacings of 0.227 and 0.921 nm, respectively.As shown in Figure 3f, some irregular shape particles with a smaller size ( 5 nm) were observed on the top or edge of the brookite nanorods, and those particles might be amorphous TiO 2 as their lattice structure is not discernable.and TiB(UP), respectively, close to the reported values of three phases TiO 2 . 15,35 y contrast, TiA (He) and TiB(He) display similar tails extending to a longer wavelength of 600 nm, while TiR(He) exhibits an almost identical absorption profile as that of TiR(UP).Both theoretical and experimental UV-vis DRS results in the literature indicated that in the case of oxygen-deficient TiO 2 , the broad band in the visible region of 450-600 nm was attributed to the light absorption of V O , which can effectively harvest visible light and create a color center. 19,26,39,40 Hece, the redshifts of TiA (He) and TiB(He) likely resulted from the formation of surface V O .Similar UV-vis DRS results were reported in our previous study indicating that thermal pretreatment in He caused the formation of V O on a Cu/TiO 2 (P25) sample. 27The almost identical absorption profiles of TiR(UP) and TiR (He) in this work indicated the absence of V O on the rutile phase.The existence of V O was further supported by the different colors of the Ti(UP) and Ti (He).The colors of the three original Ti(UP) samples were white.After He pretreatment, the color of the TiA(He) changed to brownish-gray and that of TiB(He) changed to gray (see the inset pictures in Figure 4), while TiR(He) remained white.Chen et al. 20 prepared hydrogen-reduced TiO 2 with a black color and they reported that the intrinsic defect disorders like V O and Ti interstitial on their sample caused such appearance.The color change of TiO 2 in this work directly supports the conclusion of V O formation on TiA (He) and TiB(He), whereas the three Ti(UP) samples and TiR(He) surface are relatively defect-free. A comparison of the DRIFTS spectra of unpretreated and He-pretreated samples in the range of 3000-3800 cm -1 was used to elucidate the existence of Ti 3 species.As shown in Figure 5a, similar IR bands at 3693 and 3000-3600 cm -1 exist on TiA(UP), TiR(UP) and TiB(UP).These bands are assigned to stretching vibration of H-bound OH groups and physically adsorbed H 2 O, respectively. 41,42 y contrast, for Ti(He) samples as shown in Figure 5b, the original 3693 and 3000-3600 cm -1 bands disappeared or became significantly weakened, probably due to the desorption of weakly bonded H 2 O.Meanwhile, new bands appeared at 3415, 3650, 3678 and 3720 cm -1 , where the former three bands were assigned to Ti 4 -OH and the latter one was assigned to Ti 3 -OH. 414224344 This confirms that thermal pre-treatment in He leads to the formation of Ti 3 on the Ti(He) surface due to the oxygen loss, which is in good agreement with the literature that indicated that annealing in an inert environment was likely to result in the partial reduction of Ti 4 to Ti 3 with the generation of surface V O simultaneously, i.e., Ti 4 -O-Ti 4 Ti 3 --Ti 3 2 1 O 2 . 18,19,22 O the other hand, the relative intensities of Ti 3 -OH on TiA (He) and TiB (He) are stronger than that on TiR(He).This difference suggested that the relative concentration of V O /Ti 3 sites was likely in the order of TiA(He) TiB(He) TiR (He), which is consistent with the previously presented UV-vis absorption results and the color differences noted for the three samples (Figure 4). Background tests were first conducted with a mixture of He H 2 O passing through the TiO 2 catalyst under photo-illumination; no carbon-containing products were detected.Photoreduction products (CO and CH 4 ) were observed only in the presence of CO 2 , confirming CO 2 was indeed the carbon source.CH 4 is a valuable product and can be directly used as a fuel.CO is also an important chemical feedstock and an essential component of synthetic gas or syngas, a mixture of H 2 and CO.Syngas can be further converted to liquid hydrocarbon fuels through well-known Fischer-Tropcsh processes. 1,45,46 N reaction carbon-containing products other than CO and CH 4 were detected by the GC/TCD-FID used in this work. By measuring the concentrations of CO and CH 4 at the reactor outlet, the production of CO and CH 4 , in mol g -1 , during a 6 hr photo-illumination period was calculated and the data are shown in Figure 6.TiB(He) had the highest CO production among all the tested samples, and 50 higher than TiA (He).TiA(He) had the highest CH 4 production, but only slightly higher than TiB (He).The rutile samples, pretreated or not, were the least active ones.Compared to the unpretreated samples, the activity of the He-pretreated samples was enhanced by 2.2, 10.3, and 3.9 times for CO production and by 13.3, 8.2, and 5 times for CH 4 production on anatase, brookite and rutile, respectively.It is clear that the factor of enhancement due to sample pretreatment was most significant on brookite (810 times), followed by anatase and rutile.The overall production of CO and CH 4 on TiB (He) and TiA(He) in this work was 18.9 and 12.8 mol g -1 , respectively, much higher than those reported in the literature using bare TiO 2 for CO 2 photoreduction.Koci et al. 5 reported a total production of CO, CH 4 and CH 3 OH about 2.9 mol g -1 after 8 hr photoreaction on an anatase TiO 2 sample.Dimitrijevec et al. 47 The measurement of possible O 2 production from H 2 O oxidation was investigated using pretreated brookite, i.e., TiB (He).Before turning on the UV-vis illumination, the photoreactor was purged with a CO 2 -H 2 O mixture flow to eliminate the air inside the reactor.However, there was always background O 2 and N 2 in the order of a few hundred ppm detected in the reactor effluent gas even after purging for a few hours.Hence, a better indicator of O 2 production by the catalyst during the photoreaction is the volumetric ratio of O 2 /N 2 in the effluent gas, as also suggested in our previous work. 10,13 igure 7 shows the O 2 /N 2 ratio before, during, and after the photoreaction, when gas sampling was conducted every 15 min.Before the photo-illumination (in the dark), the O 2 /N 2 ratio was steady.Interestingly, immediately upon photo-illumination, the O 2 /N 2 ratio dramatically decreased in the first 30 min and then gradually increased thereafter. This sharp decrease is possibly caused by the consumption of residual O 2 in the reactor through the reaction with photo-generated electrons O 2 e - O 2 -and consecutive reactions.generation process overweighed the previous mentioned concurrent O 2 consumption process, and thus, the net result was that the O 2 /N 2 ratio increased gradually with time and finally stabilized after 6 h when the generation/consumption processes reached equilibrium.When the light was turned off (the second dark period), an obvious drop in the O 2 /N 2 ratio was observed.This result again verified that there was O 2 generated during the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction process. The photoreduction data indicated that pretreated surfaces were more active that unpretreated ones.To further verify the role of V O /Ti 3 sites on the pretreated surface, in situ DRIFTS studies of CO 2 photoreduction with H 2 O were performed on defect-free TiA(UP) and TiB(UP), as well as defective TiA (He) and TiB (He). Figure 8 shows the IR spectra of CO 2 and H 2 O co-interaction with TiA(UP) and TiB(UP).In the dark, TiA(UP) and TiB(UP) surfaces were dominated by strongly adsorbed H 2 O at 1647 cm -1 , weak bicarbonate (HCO 3 -) features at 1420-1428 and 1221 cm -1 , and bidentate or monodentate carbonates (b-CO 3 , m-CO 3 2-) at 1500-1590 cm -1 . 31,32,36 ignificantly different results were obtained on TiA (He) and TiB(He) surfaces under the same experimental conditions.As shown in Figure 9a, exposure of TiA(He) to CO 2 and H 2 O in the dark led to the rapid formation of CO 2 -, HCO 3 -, and b-CO 3 2-species in the initial 0-5 minute timeframe.The formation of Ti 4 -CO 2 -indicates that an electron could be spontaneously attached to CO 2 from defective anatase even in the dark.The vibrational frequency of CO 2 -in this work (at 1670 and 1247 cm -1 ) correlated well with the experimental values reported in the literature 30,36 as well as the calculated values of CO 2 adsorbed on an oxygen-deficient anatase (101) plane. 24Prolonging the time to 15 min in the dark resulted in the disappearance of CO 2 and a gradual decrease of HCO 3 -and b-CO 3 2-, but an increase in the intensity of the H 2 O band. This result suggests that CO 2 and H 2 O may compete for the same defect sites; H 2 O could replace the adsorbed CO 2 -species and partially substitute HCO 3 -by occupying the V O /Ti 3 sites and OH groups.This replacement possibly results from the higher binding energy of H 2 O with TiO 2 than that of CO 2 . 21,24,29 Ahown in Figure 9b, photo-illumination apparently induced the re-appearance of CO 2 -(1675 and 1249 cm -1 ) on the TiA(He) surface.Meanwhile, the intensities of the IR spectral features for HCO 3 -(1415 and 1221 cm -1 ) and b-CO 3 2-(1583 and 1345 cm -1 ) increased with prolonged irradiation time, but that for adsorbed H 2 O decreased.This is a strong evidence that unlike TiA(UP), the TiA(He) surface allowed the photo-excited electrons that were trapped in the defect sites to transfer to the adsorbed CO 2 , although the literature indicates the difficulty or impossibility of one-electron reduction of CO 2 on TiO 2 . 2,47 o verify whether the spectral change (i.e., re-appearance of CO 2 -) could be caused by the re-adsorption of CO 2 by dehydration, an additional experiment was conducted under the following conditions in sequence: (1) pre-adsorption of H 2 O vapor on TiA(He) in the dark, (2) photo-irradiating the TiA(He) surface for 1 h, and (3) turning off the light and introducing CO 2 to TiA(He).It was found that photo-irradiation (step 2) led to surface dehydration to some extent (by observation of reduced H 2 O adsorption band intensity), but the subsequent CO 2 adsorption in the dark (step 3) on the dehydrated surface did not result in the occurrence of CO 2 -and HCO 3 -species.The above result verified that the re-appearance of CO 2 -in Figure 9b was due to the photo-induced activation and reduction of CO 2 but not due to the re-adsorption of CO 2 .These spectral changes in Figure 9 also suggest that the three carbon-containing species (CO 2 -, HCO 3 -and b-CO 3 2-) may be the primary intermediates on the treated anatase surface during the CO 2 photoreduction process, and H 2 O participates in the reaction with CO 2 by donating electrons or scavenging holes. Figure 10 shows CO 2 and H 2 O co-interaction with TiB(He) in the dark and under photoillumination.Similar to the features observed on TiA(He), H 2 O partially substituted the CO 2 -, HCO 3 -and CO 3 2-in the dark (Figure 10a), and photo-excitation of TiB(He) surface induced a remarkable reappearance of HCO 3 -with a concurrent slight decrease of H 2 O (Figure 10b). However, a reappearance of CO 2 -was not observed.Rather, two new bands at 1716 and 1379 cm -1 attributed to formic acid (HCOOH) 50 occurred under photo-illumination.This suggests that CO 2 -, HCO 3 -and HCOOH are possibly the major intermediates on the TiB(He) surface.It is also noted that a new broad band at 1495 cm -1 appeared on TiB(He) and its intensity increased with the irradiation time.The IR study of CO adsorption on Cu(I)/TiO 2 by Yang et al. 32 suggested that a similar band at 1492 cm -1 was indicative of CO adsorbed on Ti(O) sites as bicarbonates.Hence, this 1495 cm -1 band may originate from the adsorption of the CO product. Based on the photoactivity data and in situ DRIFTS observations, we proposed a tentative mechanism for CO and CH It is worth noting that unlike what occurs on TiA(He), CO 2 -was not present on TiB (He) under photo-illumination in the presence of H 2 O (Figure 10b).This is likely due to the faster reaction of CO 2 -with H (generated from H 2 O) to produce CO (Reaction 4) on TiB(He) than on TiA(He).This conclusion was supported by additional experimental results obtained under the condition where CO 2 in the absence of H 2 O vapor was allowed to interact with Ti(He) (see Figure S3).CO 2 -appeared on TiB(He) even without H 2 O vapor and its intensity increased with illumination time (Figure S3b).This may be a result of the photoreduction of adsorbed CO 2 with OH groups on the \"dry\" surface.The TiB(He) surface is favorable for adsorbed H 2 O (or OH groups or H species) to quickly scavenge CO 2 -and produce CO so that no CO 2 -could be observed on TiB(He) under illumination (Figure 10b).By contrast, the CO 2 -intensity on TiA(He) neither increased nor disappeared under illumination in the absence of H 2 O vapor (Figure S3a), suggesting a low reaction rate of CO 2 -with OH groups or H species on the TiA(He) surface.Furthermore, the photo-activity data (Figure 6) also indicate the superior activity of TiB(He) as compared to TiA(He) for CO production.Hence, the DRIFTS and photoactivity results correlate well with each other and clearly demonstrate that defective brookite is more active than anatase in facilitating the reaction of CO Regarding the reaction pathway for CH 4 formation, we propose that the carbon-containing intermediates such as CO, surface HCO 3 -and HCOOH may be converted to CH 4 via a multielectron transfer process, once dissociated hydrogen atoms are available (Reactions 7 and 11, Table 2). 13,14,45,47,52 It s also possible for CH 4 to decompose through reaction with photogenerated OH radicals to form CO. These two factors may contribute to the finding that the production of CH 4 was always lower than the production of CO determined in this work.Further investigation of the more complicated CH 4 formation mechanism involving an eight-electron transfer process will be in the scope of our future study. It is important to understand why the photoactivity for CO 2 reduction was enhanced on the defective surface.The effects of crystal structure, particle size and morphology can be excluded because the XRD, TEM, and HRTEM analyses did not indicate significant changes between the unpretreated and pretreated samples.Ultimately, the UV-vis, physical color and IR studies show apparent evidence for the formation of reactive V O /Ti 3 sites on Ti (He) It is noted that for unpretrated samples like TiA(UP) and TiB(UP), although CO 2 -was not detected under photo-illumination (Figure 8), their activity in CO 2 photoreduction was recorded by the GC measurement (Figure 6).The absence of CO 2 -in the DRIFTS measurement for the TiA(UP) and TiB(UP) samples may be because of two reasons.First, the catalyst area that was exposed to irradiation was approximately 40 times smaller in the DRIFTS reaction cell than in the flow reactor.Thus, a much smaller amount of CO 2 -was formed in the DRIFT cell.Second, the kinetics of CO 2 -transition to CO may be fast so that CO 2 -may not be detectable if in small quantity.The detection of CO 2 -on the pretreated samples, such as TiA(He), clearly reveals their higher activities in CO 2 photoreduction due to the presence of V O /Ti 3 defects. The surface area may have a minor effect on phase-dependent photoefficiency, since the activity of TiB(He) was higher than that of TiA(He) even though TiB(He) had a lower surface area (87.8 m 2 /g) than TiA(He) (163.8 m 2 /g, Table 1).There are two possible major reasons why the defective brookite phase resulted in higher combined production for CO and CH 4 as compared to the production using anatase and rutile.First, the results in Figures 4 and5 suggest that the relative concentration of V O /Ti 3 are comparable on the anatase and brookite surfaces, but are negligible on the rutile surface.This is in agreement with the theoretical results that the lower formation energy of V O on brookite (5.52 eV) and anatase (5.58 eV) may facilitate the creation of V O on these surfaces as compared to the rutile surface (5.82 eV). 23This difference accounts for the much higher activity on defective brookite and anatase than on rutile. Second, surface reaction intermediates may influence the photoactivity. 14Published studies proposed that the initial key step for the photoreduction of CO 2 was the formation of CO 2 intermediates. 24,30,33,51 Rako et al. 30 also demonstrated that a bent-CO 2 -was transformed into CO on pre-reduced Rh/TiO 2 .According to this analysis, the different behaviors of CO 2 -on TiO 2 may lead to a divergence in the activity between anatase and brookite.The mechanism discussion in Section 4.1 indicates that CO 2 -on TiB(He) is more likely to react with H than that on TiA (He), and that HCOOH is another possible intermediate on TiB (He).The added routes of HCOOH to CO and CH 4 may also contribute to the higher overall production of CO and CH 4 on defective brookite than on anatase."

Figure 2a shows the XRD patterns of the as-prepared TiO 2 .TiA(UP) remains in the pure anatase phase (JCPDS No. 21-1272, tetragonal) at 25.3, 37.8 and 47.9 (2).The diffraction peaks of TiR(UP) at 27.5, 36.1, 41.2 and 54.4 (2) are well indexed to the typical rutile (JCPDS No. 21-1276, tetragonal).The XRD pattern of TiB(UP) shows the discernible brookite phase (JCPDS No. 29-1360, orthorhombic) from its unique and strong (121) diffraction located at 30.80 (2).Pure brookite was obtained, although a very small fraction of amorphous TiO 2 was Figure 4 compares the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra, displayed in absorbance units, of demonstrate the dissociation of H 2 O (Reaction 1) and the generation of CO 2 -(Reaction 2) and HCO 3 -(Reaction 3) intermediates on both the TiA(He) and TiB(He) surfaces.In agreement with the mechanism reported in the literature, 5, 30, 33, 47, 51 CO 2 -could be reduced to CO via reaction with H (Reaction 4) or self-transformation (Reaction 5), or direct dissociation by healing the V O sites (Reaction 6).

Figure 4.The UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectra of unpretreated and He-pretreated TiO 2 2 activation and reduction with H 2 O on a photo-excited TiO 2 surface also remains very important.The adsorption of CO 2 and H 2 O on TiO 2 is the preceding step of the photoreduction reactions; however, this important step has been scarcely studied.Only limited literature on the nature of CO 2 or H 2 O chemisorption on TiO 2 has been reported using either theoretical calculations for single crystal TiO 2 21, 24, 28, 29 or experimental measurements for powdered 3,5investigate the feasibility of H 2 and O 2 production during the process of CO 2 photoreduction with H 2 O, the concentration of H 2 and O 2 was monitored in a separate test using brookite as the catalyst.The possibility of H 2 production from H 2 O splitting by photoirradiation was tested by switching the GC carrier gas from He to N 2 or Ar to enhance the sensitivity for H 2 detection.However, no matter using N 2 or Ar as GC carrier gas, still no H 2 was detected on either unpretreated or pretreated brookite, although H 2 production is thermodynamically feasible in theory.This result agrees with our previous published results that no H 2 was formed on an iodine-doped TiO 2 catalyst during CO 2 photoreduction with H 2 O.10The literature also reported either no H 2 or trace H 2 production on bare TiO 2 , with concentrations of H 2 much smaller than those of the CO 2 reduction products.3,5TheH 2 production was prominent only in the presence of 49,48 metal co-catalysts (e.g., Pt, Ag)9,48or in the presence of sacrificial agents (e.g., CH 3 OH).20,48Arecentstudy49using a Pt/TiO 2 thin-film catalyst for CO 2 photoreduction with H 2 O reported only CO and CH 4 production without detection of H 2 .Based on the literature results and our findings, we believe the absence of H 2 production in this work is possibly due to the following reasons: (1) the lack of noble metal co-catalysts to lower the activation barrier for H 2 production; (2) protons or H radicals formed by the photo-dissociation of water is competitively consumed by CO 2 reduction intermediates like CO 2 -to produce CO and CH 4 ; and (3) the produced H 2 , if any, can be consumed by backward reactions with CO or O 2 . 13,14The gradual increase in the O 2 /N 2 ratio after the 30 min photo-illumination suggested the generation of O 2 through oxidation of H 2 O by photo-generated holes, H 2 O 2h 2H 2 1 O 2 .This O 2 Under subsequent photo-illumination, the IR features for CO 2 -related species and H 2 O were almost identical to those in the dark, even after 60 minutes of illumination.No CO 2 -or other new species were formed, and the adsorbed H 2 O was stable, indicating the difficulty in activating CO 2 and H 2 O on irradiated TiA(UP) and TiB(UP). 4 formation from CO 2 photoreduction with H 2 O on defective anatase and brookite TiO 2 , as expressed in Reactions 1-11 in Table 2.The IR results in Figures 9 and 10 2 -with H 2 O.In addition, IR results in Figures 9 and 10 show the formation of HCOOH on TiB(He) but not on TiA(He).HCOOH may originate from the reaction of CO 2 or CO 2 -with two H and electrons (Reactions 8 and 9, Table 2).Ulagappan et al. 50pointed out that HCOOH, generated by CO 2 photo-reaction with methanol on Ti-silica sieve, could be photodissociated into CO and H 2 O. Similar dissociation of HCOOH to CO may occur on the TiB(He) surface (Reaction 10, .This unique reaction on TiB(He) indicates that CO 2 photoreduction to CO probably undergoes different mechanisms on defective anatase and brookite phases through different surface.In situ DRIFTS results in Figures 8-10 demonstrate the more favorable formation of briged-CO 2 -, HCO 3 -or HCOOH and the dissociation of H 2 O on oxygen-deficient Ti(He) rather than on defect-free Ti(UP), which confirms that the V O /Ti 3 defects, as \"local factors\", could readily provide reactive sites for the adsorption of reactants and allow effective charge or hole transfer between CO 2 /H 2 O and the TiO 2-x surface under photo-illumination. generating CO 2 -intermediates.Another important finding was that for TiO 2 surfaces engineered with defect sites, brookite, the least studied structure among the three TiO 2 polymorphs, had the highest yield for CO and CH 4 production, followed by anatase and rutile.Possible reasons for this superior activity of defective brookite include the facilitated formation of oxygen vacancies, faster reaction rate of CO 2 -with adsorbed H 2 O or surface OH groups, and an additional reaction route involving an HCOOH intermediate.This study has provided new information to correlate the surface chemistry (defect sites, reaction intermediates) with CO 2 reduction activity by TiO 2 .
