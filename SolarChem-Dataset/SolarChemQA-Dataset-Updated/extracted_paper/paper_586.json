    "content": "A series of erbium-doped CeO 2 composites loaded with reduced graphene oxide (rGO, denoted as Er-doped CeO 2 / rGO) were prepared via a hydrothermal method.The crystal structures, morphological characteristics, and surface physicochemical properties of the as-prepared Er-doped CeO 2 /rGO composites were characterized through X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflection spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.The photocatalytic activities of the composite samples were further evaluated by reducing CO 2 to methanol.Results show that erbium (III) doping caused a red shift of the response spectrum from 392 nm to 451 nm, and that rGO loading induced a response spectrum shift to 467.9 nm.The corresponding reduction yields of CO 2 to methanol approached 42.5 and 135.6 lmol g 21 cat h 21 for Er-doped CeO 2 /CuO and Er-doped CeO 2 /rGO/CuO catalysts under similar conditions in 5 h, respectively.Accordingly, rGO enhances significantly the yield of the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 to methanol."

    "content": "Graphite powder (average particle size 5 30 lm) was purchased from Shanghai Colloid Chemical Plant (Shanghai, China).Cerium (III) trichloride heptahydrate (CeCl 3 A7H 2 O) with erbium (III) nitrate pentahydrate (Er(NO 3 ) 3 A5H 2 O) obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Co. LLC.and Na 2 SO 3 and NaOH procured from Tianjin Damao Chemical Factory, China.All of the reagents were of analytical grade and utilized as the received.All of the solutions were prepared with 18.2 MX cm 21 deionized Milli-Q water. Graphene oxide (GO) was synthesized via a modified Hummers method as previously described 47,48.First, graphitic oxide was prepared by adding powdered graphite flakes of 1.0 g and sodium nitrate of 0.5 g to 23 mL of 98 sulfuric acid while stirring.The ingredients were mixed in a 250-mL beaker that was cooled to 108C in an ice bath.While maintaining vigorous agitation, potassium permanganate of 3.0 g was added to the suspension, with agitation maintained for 3 h.Then, the ice bath was removed, and the temperature of the suspension was increased to 358C and maintained for 35 min.Afterwards, water of 45 mL was slowly dropped into the paste, causing violent effervescence and an increase in temperature to 988C.The diluted suspension, now brown in color, was maintained at this temperature for 15 min.The suspension was further diluted to 140 mL with warm water and then treated with 10 H 2 O 2 to reduce the residual permanganate and manganese dioxide to colorless soluble manganese sulfate.Upon the treatment with H 2 O 2 , the suspension turned bright yellow.The suspension was centrifuged, yielding a yellow-brown paste.Using a centrifuge, the paste was washed three times with 5 HCl solution, two times with 95 alcohol, and three times with deionized water in sequence, resulting in GO.The GO was dehydrated at 608C in vacuo for 12 h.The as-synthesized GO (0.0050 g) was ultrasonically dispersed in deionized water of 10.0 mL to produce the GO solution. CeCl 3 A7H 2 O (0.5587 g, 1.5 mmol) and Er(NO 3 ) 3 A5H 2 O (0.0160 g, 0.036 mmol) were separately dissolved in deionized water of 10.0 mL.Then, both solutions were mixed by stirring.Then, 1.0 mol L 21 NaOH of 15 mL was added dropwise to the mixed solution by stirring till a bright yellow color was achieved.Then, the GO dispersion solution was added drop-wise to the Ce(OH) 3 suspension solution by continuously stirring.Deionized water was added to the suspension solution to a final total volume of 60 mL.The suspension solution was then transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave of 100 mL that was sealed and maintained at 1808C for 6-8 h.The suspension was cooled to room temperature and filtered to collect the Er-doped CeO 2 / rGO (the stoichiometric formula as Ce 0.9766 Er 0.0234 O 2 /rGO) precipitates. Ce 0.9766 Er 0.0234 O 2 /rGO/CuO sample was prepared by adding Er-doped CeO 2 /rGO in 0.005 mol L 21 CuSO 4 solution of 20.0 mL.The mixed system containing Ce 0.9766 Er 0.0234 O 2 /rGO and Cu 21 was vigorously stirred for 2 h.Then, 1.0 mol L 21 NaOH of 5 mL was dropped into the suspension solution.Finally, the suspension solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave of 50 mL that was sealed and maintained at 1808C for 6-8 h.The suspension being cooled to room temperature, the precipitates were filtered, washed with deionized water and collected.A Ce 0.9766 Er 0.0234 O 2 /rGO/CuO (rGO 5 4.0, CuO 5 4.0 wt) composite photocatalyst was obtained. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed using an X-ray diffractometer (Bruker D8, Germany).The Cu Ka radiation with a wavelength of 0.15406 nm, tube voltage of 40 kV, and tube current of 40 mA was the X-ray source.The electron micrographs were obtained using a JEOL JEM-2000F transmission electron microscope operating at 200 kV.Powder samples were dispersed in water by using an ultrasonic device, placed on C-coated Cu grids, and dried under ambient conditions for morphological observations.The UVvisible (UV-vis) diffuse reflectance spectra were obtained under ambient conditions by using a Shimadzu model UV-2550 spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere.BaSO 4 was used as a reference, with spectra recorded in the range of 200-800 nm.The Raman spectra were recorded on an HR800 micro-confocal Raman spectrometer with a laser of 633 nm, and the power of the laser line was maintained at 3 mW to prevent a local heating effect.The resolution of the spectrometer was 1 cm 21 with a diameter of the analyzed spot of about 1 lm.The CeO 2 , Ce 0.9766 Er 0.0234 O 2, and Ce 0.9766 Er 0.0234 O 2 /rGO/CuO powder samples were placed on a clean SiO 2 /Si substrate for the Raman measurement. A gas chromatograph (Type 7890B, Agilent Technologies) equipped with a hydrogen flame detector with a 30-m-long Stabilwax with Integra-Guard column was used to detect methanol. A model XSAM 800 X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) was used to characterize the valence state of Ce, C, and Er in the Er-doped CeO 2 /rGO/CuO samples.The binding energy (E b ) scale was calibrated with respect to the C 1s peak at 284.60 eV.The Al Ka 1.2 line (hv 5 1486.60 eV) was used as the X-ray excitation source, with the instrument operated in a vacuum of 1 3 10 29 Torr in the analysis chamber. The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 was carried out using a photoreactor (Type BL-GHX-V, Shanghai Bilon Instrument, China) in a 250 mL aqueous system under 250 W xenon lamp irradiation in the inner suspension solution.In distilled water of 250 mL containing NaHCO 3 (0.1 mol L 21 ) and 0.1 mol L 21 Na 2 SO 3 as electron donors, photocatalyst of 0.1 g was dispersed.The suspension solution was purged with CO 2 to remove oxygen for 20 min before the lamp was switched on.The suspension solution was magnetically stirred during irradiation.Control experiments were conducted in the dark or under irradiation without catalysts.Blank CH 3 OH was also detected for all the tested catalysts before photoreaction occurred.The temperature inside the photoreactor was maintained at about 298 K by applying continuous water circulation driven by a 50-W freezer."

    "content": "Figure 1 shows the XRD pattern of CeO 2 samples doped with erbium ions and loaded with rGO.The X-ray diffraction patterns of (a) CeO Figure 2 shows the Raman spectra of (a) CeO 2 , (b) Ce 0.9766 Er 0.0234 O 2 , (c) Ce 0.9766 Er 0.0234 O 2 /rGO, and (d) Ce 0.9766 Er 0.0234 O 2 /rGO/CuO samples.The observed peaks at approximately 465 cm 21 were assigned to the characteristic F 2g mode of the face-centered cubic fluorite phase of CeO 2 materials (Fm3 m group).The peak at 595 cm 21 was attributed to the O vacancies due to the presence of Ce 31 in the CeO 2 lattice and defects caused by small size effects 51.Interestingly, the peak became small when Er (III) ions were doped in the CeO 2 lattices as shown by Curve b in Figure 2. Finally, the peak disappeared when rGO was introduced to CeO 2 , as shown by Curves c and d.As a consequence, the Er (III) ions were doped into the CeO 2 lattices. The Raman spectra of graphene have two main features, namely, G and D modes, each presenting different physical origins.The peak at 1598 cm 21 (G band) arising from the emission of zone-centered optical phonons corresponds with the doubly degenerated E 2g mode of graphite and it is related to the coplanar vibration of sp 2 -bonded C atoms.The peak at 1335 cm 21 (D band) is related to the occurrence of defects and disorders.The intensity ratio of D to G bands (I D /I G 5 1.26) is extremely low, displaying the lowered defect density of rGO when linked to Er-doped CeO 2 . The Er-doped CeO 2 loaded with rGO and rGO samples were placed in the vacuum chamber for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations.The rGO sheets are clearly visible in Figure 3a, with Figure 3b-d indicating the different-scale micrographs of Er-doped CeO 2 nanoparticles distributed on rGO sheets.Figure 3d shows a high-resolution TEM image, from which the polycrystalline nature and crystal size of Er-doped CeO 2 can be clearly observed.The TEM image reveals that Er-doped CeO 2 is crystalline with the crystal size of 3-7 nm.This result is in good agreement with the XRD observations.Lattice fringes can be observed in the magnified images of different crystallites with the d-spacing value measured as 0.30 nm, which corresponds to the interplane distance between the (111) lattice planes of cubic CeO 2 . The UV-vis absorption spectra of the CeO 2 , Er-doped CeO 2 , and Er-doped CeO 2 /rGO samples are shown in Figure 4.The direct band-gap energy (E g ) is determined by fitting absorption data to the direct transition, as shown in Tauc-Mott equation 52, ahv 2 5Ahv2E g , where a is the optical absorption coefficient, hm is the photon energy, E g is the direct band-gap energy, and A is a constant.The linear portions of curves toward absorption equaling zero (y 5 0) were extrapolated to yield E g for direct transitions (Figure 5).The estimated direct band gaps for CeO 2 , Er-doped CeO 2, and Er-doped CeO 2 /rGO samples were equal to 3.15, 2.75, and 2.65 eV, respectively.The band gap of Er-doped CeO 2 was narrower than that of CeO 2 because of the doping of erbium (III) ions in CeO 2 , leading to enhanced oxygen vacancies.The Er-doped CeO 2 /rGO sample possesses the smallest band gap of 2.65 eV, which corresponds to 468 nm.The red shift of the absorption edge of Er-doped CeO 2 /rGO benefited the absorption of solar energy. The wide-scan XPS spectrum of the as-synthesized Erdoped CeO 2 /rGO/CuO sample is shown in Figure 6a.C 1s, O 1s, and Ce 3d peaks appear at 284.6, 534, and 900 eV, respectively 37, evidently proving the existence of Ce, C, and O elements in the sample.Figure 6b,c display the highresolution XPS spectra of the sample.The peak at 167.7 eV is attributed to the binding energy of Er 4d 53.Therefore, the results reveal that the erbium element was doped in the CeO 2 cell lattices.The Cu peaks appeared at 934.88 and 955.59 eV, which were assigned to Cu 2p 3/2 and Cu 2p 1/2 binding energy in CuO particles, revealing that CuO were linked to the Er-doped CeO 2 /rGO catalyst 54,55. The reactivity of CeO 2 , Er-doped CeO 2 , CeO 2 /rGO, and Er-doped CeO 2 /rGO/CuO catalysts was examined by means of the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 to methanol with Na 2 SO 3 as sacrificial donor and water as solvent.During photocatalytic reduction, liquid of 1 mL was withdrawn at intervals and analyzed by a gas chromatograph equipped with a hydrogen flame detector with a Stabilwax w/Integra-Guard column of 30-m long.Methanol yields are presented in Figure 7.At 5 h, the methanol yields approached 0.2, 6.2,Moreover, the yields of methanol for Er-doped CeO 2 /rGO/CuO, Er-doped CeO 2 /rGO and CeO 2 /rGO catalysts were 3.2-fold, 10.8-fold, and 169-fold those of the corresponding Er-doped CeO 2 /CuO, Er-doped CeO 2 , and CeO 2 catalysts without rGO, respectively.These results reveal profoundly that rGO significantly enhances the photocatalytic activity of CeO 2 as a cocatalyst for the reduction of carbon dioxide to methanol.The significantly enhanced effect is possibly attributed to the separation of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs by rGO and the absorption of light irradiation by rGO.The material shows the high catalytic activity compared with TiO 2 56. A series of tests with various ratios of erbium mass comparing to that of cerium dioxide were conducted to determine the optimal methanol yield.The results are listed in Table 1. By comparison, the doping of erbium in cerium dioxide enhanced the activity of the catalyst.In the initial stage, the yield of methanol increased with erbium doping, approaching a maximum value of 6.4 lmol g 21 cat h 21 at 2.0 wt erbium of cerium dioxide.However, the activity of the catalyst decreases when the 2.0 wt erbium point is exceeded.Therefore, the optimal percentage of erbium mass in Erdoped CeO 2 catalyst is 2.0, with the formula denoted as Ce 0.9766 E r0.0234 O 2 .The enhanced effect of Er doping is possibly attributed to the red shift absorption of light irradiation. The optimal yield of methanol can be achieved by loading various masses of rGO.Table 2 displays the yields of Erdoped CeO 2 distributed in various masses of GO.The methanol yield increased with the GO mass reaching to the maximum of 66.8 lmolAg 21 cat.Ah 21 at 4.0 of GO, whereas only 6.4 lmol g 21 cat h 21 was reached at 0.0 of GO.Further addition of GO did not increase the methanol yield, thus the optimal percentage of GO in the Er-doped CeO 2 catalyst Table 3 displays the effects of various CuO amounts on methanol yield.At the initial stage, the yield of methanol increased with the CuO weight reaching 135.6 lmol g 21 cat h 21 at 4.0 of CuO, amounting up to a maximum value.The yield shows the photocatalytic activity of the Er-doped CeO 2 /rGO catalyst is higher than that of TiO 2 catalyst 56.Beyond that point, a continuous addition of CuO led to the decline in methanol yield instead of an increase.As a result, the optimal percentage of CuO in Erdoped CeO 2 /rGO catalyst is 4.0 wt. To verify the origin of methanol, we conducted a blank test on 0.1 mol L 21 Na 2 SO 3 solution containing Er-doped CeO 2 /rGO/CuO catalyst of 0.10 g in the absence of NaHCO 3 .The analytical result revealed that methanol was not detected in the absence of the NaHCO 3 system even if this system was irradiated for 5 h.This finding confirmed that methanol did not originate from the catalyst.

    "content": "CeO 2 is a rare-earth semiconductor with the tunable band gap.The band gap can be tuned by doping erbium (III) ions into CeO 2 lattices, which narrows the band gap.The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 to methanol can be significantly enhanced by loading reduced GO as a cocatalyst, which functions by separating the photogenerated pairs of electrons and holes.The loaded CuO acts as a selective cocatalyst, which determines the main product of CO 2 reduction to fuel. 2 , (b) Er-doped CeO 2 , (c) Er-doped CeO 2 /rGO, and (d) Er-doped CeO 2 /rGO/CuO samples depict the expected peaks that are perfectly indexed as the facecentered cubic fluorite phase of well-crystallized CeO 2 materials (Fm3 m; JCPDS card No. 34-0394) with lattice constants a 5 b 5 c 5 5.4141 A .The diffraction peaks at 2h 5 28.568, 33.208, 47.288, 56.648, 58.928, 69.308, and 76.898 are assigned to the Braggs reflections from the (111), (220), (220), (311), (222), (400), and (331) planes49, respectively.The average diameters (D) of the as-synthesized CeO 2 particles were calculated using the Debye-Scherrer equation, D 5 Kk/(Wcosh), in a diffraction angle of 28.568 (2h) as 3.1 nm for CeO 2 sample, 4.8 nm for Er-doped CeO 2 sample, and 5.1 nm for Erdoped CeO 2 /rGO sample.No peaks were observed from erbium oxide in Figure1, showing erbium ions at lattices of CeO 2 crystal50.
