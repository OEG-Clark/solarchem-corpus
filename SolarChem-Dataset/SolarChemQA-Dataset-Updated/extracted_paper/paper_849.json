    "content": "Well-designed montmorillonite (Mt) coupled graphitic carbon nitride (m-CN) composite for stimulating photocatalytic CO 2 hydrogenation with H 2 and H 2 O reducing agents has been investigated.2D Mt nanosheets were uniformly anchored with 2D m-CN nanosheets for improving charge carrier separation.The photoactivity of 2D/ 2D Mt/m-CN was tested for CO 2 photoreduction with H 2 O/H 2 to CO/CH 4 through RWGS and CO 2 methanation reactions under visible light.Using 20 Mt/m-CN, highest CO and CH 4 yield rate of 253 and 165 mol gcat -1 h -1 were obtained, 5.9 and 6.4 times high than g-C 3 N 4 , respectively.This improved activity reflects synergistic effect between Mt and m-CN, which promotes photo-induced charge carrier separation.More interestingly, during CO 2 reduction with hydrogen, CH 4 was the main product and its production was 2.1 folds higher than using CO 2 reduction by H 2 O.This selective CO 2 hydrogenation to methane was obviously due to single-step CO 2 methanation process with proficient H 2 oxidation over highly efficient Mt/m-CN composite.The QY for CH 4 production of 4.55 was obtained with high stability in cycles over the composite catalyst.The findings from this research would be fruitful for further investigation in CO 2 conversion for selective fuels production to provide clean energy.Au-NPs loaded TiO 2 NWs with selective production of CO through RWGS reaction was reported 12.In another work, monolithic Ag/ TiO 2 for dynamic photocatalytic CO 2 to CO conversion through RWGS has been investigated 13.Therefore, it would be promising to explore hydrogen as a reducing agent for selective reduction of CO 2 to fuels under visible light irradiation.Among the semiconductors, TiO 2 has been widely used in CO 2 reduction process due to its several advantages which include low cost, high thermal stability and more positive reduction potential 14,15.However, TiO 2 poor photo-activity and functional under UV-light are the limitations 16,17.Thus, efficient and visible light active photocatalysts are highly demanding for solar fuels production during CO 2 reduction process 18.Recently, layered and low-cost materials are under consideration to maximize CO 2 conversion efficiency and"

    "content": "Melamine (merck, 99.99), montmorillonite (Bentonite, Sigma Aldrich), Methanol (Merck) and deionized water (DI) were the chemicals used as received without further purification. Initially, g-C 3 N 4 powder was synthesized using melamine through single step hydrothermal approach as reported in our previous work 24.Specifically, melamine (5 g) was heated after placing in a ceramic crucible at 550 C for 2 h under air atmosphere.After cooling to room temperature, the cake obtained was further grinded to get find powder of graphitic carbon nitride using mortar and pestle and named as g-C 3 N 4 .The g-C 3 N 4 surface modification was further conducted through the protonation using 1 M nitric acid through ultrasonic.For this purpose, g-C 3 N 4 (1 g) powder was dispersed in 1 M HNO 3 solution (40 mL) and stirred for next 12 h and sonicated for 30 min, alternatively.Afterwards, slurry was centrifuged and sludge was washed with water several time to remove impurities and to get pH near to neutral.Finally, sample was oven dried at 80 C overnight, grinded and named as modified g-C 3 N 4 (m-CN). For the synthesis of Mt/m-CN composite, a simple ultrasonic method was employed under normal temperature.First, specific amount of Mt was dispersed in 20 mL methanol under stirring and sonicated for 30 min to get exfoliated thin 2D Mt nanosheets.Next, 2D m-CN nanosheets were synthesized according to method as discussed above.Typically, 1 g m-CN was added in 20 mL methanol and dispersed uniformly.Afterwards, Mt suspension was added gently under stirring to get homogenous suspension.The mixture was sonicated for 30 min for further dispersion and finally dried at 80 C under air atmosphere for 24 h.Finally, sample was grinded and named as Mt-dispersed m-CN composite.The samples with different Mt loading amounts for example 10, 20 and 30 wt were synthesized using the same procedure by varying initial amount of Mt.The scheme for the synthesis of Mt dispersed m-CN composite has been presented in Fig. 1. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was conducted using Bruker D8 Advance spectrometer to determine phase and crystalline structure of catalyst samples.XRD machine was operated at 40 kV and 40 mA using a Cu K radiation source and results of 2 were collected in range of 5 to 80.FESEM images were obtained to determine the morphology with Hitachi SU8020 instrument.Similarly, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained using HITACHI HT7700 machine.The elemental state of samples was obtained using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) with Axis Ultra DLD instrument.Ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) diffuse reflectance spectra were measured using a Cary 100 Agilent spectrophotometer equipped with integrated sphere for loading powder samples.Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were obtained on a HORIBA spectrometer under a wavelength 325 nm.Raman analysis were conducted using spectrophotometer (HORIBA Scientific) operated at wavelength 532 nm as an excitation source. Experiments for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O and H 2 reducing agents were conducted using a fixed-bed photoreactor system under visible light irradiation.The reactor was equipped with a glass window for passing light irradiation.A 35 W Xenon lamp was used as a source of visible light with intensity 20 mW cm -1 located at the top of glass window.Typically, powder photocatalyst (150 mg) was uniformly spread at the reactor bottom for efficient light distribution.Before starting the experiment, CO 2 was bubbled through a water flask to carry moisture and passed through the reactor for 30 min to purge the system and to saturate the catalyst surface with reactants.N 2 gas was used to clean the system before adding catalyst into the reactor and during stability analysis.For photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with hydrogen, both gases (CO 2 , H 2 ) were mixed in a gas mixture before entering into reactor and catalyst bed was saturated for 30 min before starting the next experiment.High purity CO 2 (99.99) and H 2 (99.99) gases were regulated by a mass flow controllers (MFC) with flow rate 10 mL min -1 and CO 2 /H 2 feed ratio of 1.0 was adjusted in all the experiments.All the experiments were conducted without providing external heat and under atmospheric pressure.Online GC-TCD/FID (GC-Agilent Technologies 6890 N, USA) was used for the analysis of reaction products.In addition, a HP-PLOT Q capillary was equipped with FID detector for separation of C 1 -C 3 hydrocarbons.Similarly, TCD detector was equipped with CARBOXEN 1010 plot column for the analysis of CO, CO 2 , CH 4 and H 2 elements."

    "content": "Fig. 2 (a) presents XRD plots of Mt, g-C 3 N 4 , m-CN and Mt/m-CN composite samples.XRD peaks for Mt were identified at 2 of 7.03, 19.69, 21.91, 26.55, 28.32, 34.46, 53.90and 61.87, ascribed to typical layered structure of Mt.Pure g-C 3 N 4 reflects peaks at 2 of 27.44and 12.93, confirms the polymeric and graphitic structure of g-C 3 N 4 38.Similarly, XRD peaks for m-CN were appeared at 2 of 13.11and 27.67 o ascribed to pure polymeric and graphitic structure of graphitic carbon nitride.The shift in peaks towards higher 2 value further confirms successful formation of m-CN and similarly reported in the literature 39.When Mt was loaded to m-CN, all the original reflection of m-CN appeared.However, Mt peaks intensity was somewhat reduced.This was obviously due to lower amount of Mt loading (20 wt ) compared to m-CN.Thus, XRD plots confirmed the presence of Mt and m-CN peaks in the composite sample with their polymeric and graphitic structure.More importantly, in the composite of Mt/m-CN, all the peaks relating to Mt and m-CN were appeared.The additional peak in the Mt/m-CN composite at 2 of 31.57wasdue to delaminating Mt layers after exfoliation.This further confirms successful development of composite sample without any change in the structure and morphology. The Raman analysis of Mt, g-C 3 N 4 , m-CN and Mt/m-CN composite was further investigated to confirm successful development of hybrid composite of Mt/m-CN and the results are demonstrated in Fig. 2 (b).For the Raman spectra of pristine Mt strong bands in the range of 200 to 400 cm -1 and several weak bands in the range of 500 to 1300 cm -1 were observed.The band at 1091 cm -1 can be ascribed to SiO 4 unit v 3 (f 2 ) vibrational mode.Similarly, bands appeared at 892 cm -1 can be ascribed to AlOH with the presence of M (metal; for example Fe) in the octahedral position.The obvious band occurring at 684 cm -1 was probably due to v 1 (a 1 ) mode of SiO 4 tetrahedron.The strong band appeared at 395 cm -1 can be ascribed to v 3 (a 1 ) internal vibration mode of SiO 4 tetrahedron units.Similarly, strong band appeared at 281 cm -1 was probably due to v 1 (A 1 ) O-H-O unit.Another strong band at 215 cm -1 was due to v 1 (A 1g ) vibrational mode of AlO 6 octahedron unit.The g-C 3 N 4 peaks appeared at 323, 478, 588, 707, 765, 979, 1116, 1232, 1312, 1481 and 1619 cm -1 , which confirmed graphitic structure of C 3 N 4 as illustrated in Fig. 2(c).The Raman peaks at 478, 707 and 1232 cm 1 can be ascribed to vibration of the tri-s-triazine ring.The obvious peaks appeared at 702 and 979 cm -1 evidenced the presence of heptazine ring structure.Furthermore, asymmetric peaks ranging from 1300 to 1700 cm -1 were attributed to CeN stretching vibration and D and G bands due to graphitic carbon.The similar patterns were obtained in the modified graphitic carbon nitride (m-CN), confirming surface charge modification by protonation did not alter structure and basic framework of g-C 3 N 4 .Furthermore, Raman bands of Mt/m-CN confirms the presence of vibrational bands for both the Mt and m-CN.However, with Mt loading, peaks become broader and more obvious, confirming successful loading of Mt over 2D interface of m-CN structure.More importantly, g-C 3 N 4 bands at 478, 707 and 1232 cm -1 become stronger in the Mt/m-CN composite sample.This was obviously due to the complete dispersion of graphitic carbon nitride with Mt to get 2D/2D Mt/g-C 3 N 4 composite with further combination of tri-striazine units.Conversely, characteristics peak of g-C 3 N 4 at 979 cm 1 become weaker due to more triazine rings combine to form tri-s-triazine units during composite synthesis process 40. The structure and morphology of pristine and composite samples was investigated using SEM at different magnifications.Fig. 3 shows FESEM images of Mt, pure g-C 3 N 4 , m-CN and Mt/m-CN composite samples.Fig. 3 (a-b) presents 2D layered structure of montmorillonite (Mt).It could be seen that Mt sheets are stacked together with disorder structure.Besides, Mt sheets are thin in size and present flower like structure.The 2D structure of g-C 3 N 4 could be seen in Fig. 3 (c).This reveals g-C 3 N 4 has polymeric and layered structure in which all the 2D nanosheets are folded together.After surface modification and ultrasonic treatment, m-CN sheets were exfoliated with 2D obvious structure as demonstrated in Fig. 3 (d).The morphology of Mt dispersed with m-CN has been presented in Fig. 3 (e-f).It could be seen that Mt sheets are aggregated with m-CN sheets, producing a good composite heterojunction.This further confirms uniform dispersion of 2D m-CN sheets with 2D Mt sheets to develop 2D/2D aggregated layered structure.This would be fruitful for faster charges separation with enlarged exposed surface area for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to produce selective fuels under visible light irradiations. TEM analysis was further conducted to investigate interaction between Mt and m-CN materials and results are presented in Fig. 4. Fig. 4 (a-b) shows 2D Mt sheets dispersed with 2D m-CN structure.The dark color sheets belong to m-CN, however, Mt sheets have light gray color.Furthermore, exfoliated g-C 3 N 4 presents thin layered structure and similar sheets structure could be seen for exfoliated Mt structure, resulting in good interaction between Mt and m-CN to develop 2D/2D hybrid heterojunction composite.Fig. 4 (c-d) presents HRTEM images in which a heterojunction formation between Mt and m-CN could be observed.The d-spacing of Mt and m-CN were further calculated using HRTEM analysis and results are presented in Fig. 4(e-f).The lattice fringes for Mt and m-CN were identified to be 0.315 nm and 0.331 nm, respectively.This confirms the presence of both the materials with their good dispersion.Thus, a good interaction between the interfaces of Mt/ m-CN for proficient charge transfer rate was achieved. The EDX mapping analysis of Mt/m-CN composite was further conducted and the results are presented in Fig. 5. Fig. 5 and CeNeH, respectively.The elemental interaction of m-CN and g-C 3 N 4 samples shows similar characteristics, which confirms that surface modification did not alter structure of g-C 3 N 4 23.However, a weak peak positioned at 407.72 eV demonstrating successful surface modification through protonation and similarly reported in literature 24.After calibrating the binding energy of C1s peak at 284.6 eV, Fig. 6 Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction experiments were conducted using water and hydrogen as the reducing agents in a fixed bed photoreactor under visible light irradiation.All the experiments were conducted at atmospheric pressure and without providing external heating.During CO 2 reduction with H 2 O and H 2 , CO and CH 4 were identified as the potential products, however, their production was dependent on the reducing agent employed.Control experiments were conducted without catalysts or feed mixture under light irradiation.There was no detection of CO or CH 4 in the dark or without using feed mixture or catalyst, confirming CO or CH 4 were originated from CO 2 during photocatalysis process. The photocatalytic performance of g-C 3 N 4 , m-CN and effect of Mt loading on the activity of m-CN for CO 2 photoreduction to CO and CH 4 is presented in Fig. 8 (a).In all the catalysts, CO was evolved as the potential product with appreciable amount of methane production under visible light irradiation.Using pure g-C 3 N 4 , the lower amounts of CO and CH 4 were obtained, which were considerably enhanced in modified g-C 3 N 4 (m-CN).The yield of CO and CH 4 obtained with m-CN was 1.89 and 1.27 folds more than using pure g-C 3 N 4 .This was obviously due to protonation of graphitic carbon nitride, which prevents charges recombination in the layered structure 42.With Mt loading, the amount of CO production was significantly improved.Among all the samples highest m-CN activity was obtained with 20 wt Mt loading with CO and CH 4 production of 505 and 330 mole g-cat -1 , respectively .These amounts were 3.14 and 5.02 folds higher than using m-CN for the production of CO and CH 4 , respectively.This enhanced photoactivity was noticeably due to layered 2D structure of Mt coupled with 2D structure of m-CN to develop heterojunction composite with good charge carrier separation.In addition, Mt works as a sink to prevent charge carrier recombination and transport towards CO 2 for its reduction, thus enabling enhanced photocatalytic activity 30,36.The decreased in photoactivity of m-CN with any loading above 20 wt Mt would be due to shading effect and creating charges recombination centers as similarly reported previously 43.Thus, 20 wt Mt is the optimized loading amount at which highest m-CN photoactivity can be achieved.These results confirms Mt as a promising green material for maximizing m-CN activity under visible light irradiations for dynamic conversion of CO 2 to CO and CH 4 under visible light.Previously, Ndoped graphene coupled CdS with enhanced CO 2 reduction to CO and CH 4 has been reported 44.Thus, developing composite is an important strategy to promote charge carrier separation compared to single materials and similarly reported in the literature 45. The effect of irradiation time on the performance of m-CN and Mt/ m-CN composite for the production of CO and CH 4 was further investigated and results are shown in Fig. 8 (b).Obviously, CO and CH 4 are continually obtained with time on stream under visible light irradiation.Using pristine m-CN, production of CO and CH 4 were very small, which were greatly enhanced in Mt loading.In addition, CO remained main product with time on stream in all types of catalysts i.e., m-CN and Mt/m-CN composite samples.It was observed that initially in the first 30 min, production of CO was slower, but it was significantly enhanced after 60 min until reached to steady state.On the other hand, a gradual production of CH 4 was observed over the entire reaction time.The effects of Mt loading has more contribution to promote CO production compared to CH 4 using H 2 O as a reducing agent.This was perhaps due to thermodynamics reduction potential of products and materials as discussed in the reaction mechanism section.Previously, we reported MMT/TiO 2 catalyst for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O under UV-light with selective production of CO 46.In another work, ZnMn 2 O 4 flower like microspheres were employed for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O, while CO was identified as the main product, while its production was continuous over the entire irradiation time 47.Similarly, CO 2 reduction with H 2 O for selective production of CO over ZnV 2 O 4 microspheres under visible light has been investigated 48.Recently, Mn and Cu modified g-C 3 N 4 was tested and reported enhanced CO and CH 4 production under visible light 49. The performance of Mt/m-CN composite was further tested through Obviously, there were continuous evolution of CO and methane employing both the reducing agents (H 2 and H 2 O) over the entire irradiation time, however, the production trends were entirely different. Using CO 2 -water system, CO was major product, while using H 2 as a reducing agent, significant amount of methane was produced.Using CO 2 -hydrogen reaction system, the production of CO and CH 4 were increased by 1.1 and 1.7 folds, respectively, compared to CO 2 -water system under the same operating conditions after 2 h of irradiation time.Furthermore, total amount of CO and CH 4 evolution was 1.37 folds higher through CO 2 -hydrogen reaction system compared to CO 2water system.This confirms that the production of both CO and CH 4 were increased by replacing water with hydrogen as the reducing agent.This is because water is a weak reducing agent and is oxidized with higher energy consumption compared to hydrogen and similar observations have been reported in literature 50.More importantly, in both the systems, Mt/m-CN composite catalyst persists high stability with continuous CO and CH 4 production over the irradiation time. Thermodynamically, standard reduction potential of water to produce hydrogen is much lower compared to standard CO 2 reduction potential for its activation.Therefore, during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with water over the Mt/m-CN composite, CO 2 reduction reaction competes with hydrogen production, resulting in lower amount of CO and CH 4 production.Consequently, there would be possible consumption of electrons for the production of hydrogen through water splitting instead of CO 2 reduction for CO and CH 4 production.However, these competing reactions can be avoided by directly introducing hydrogen as the reducing agent.Therefore, photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to CO and CH 4 was increased through employing H 2 as the reducing agent.This reveals that CO 2 hydrogenation process was activated during CO 2 reduction with H 2 through a single step photocatalytic CO 2 methanation reaction as illustrated in Eq. ( 1).However, during CO 2 reduction with H 2 O, water gas shift reaction was prominent, enabling more CO production as illustrated in Eq. (2). (1) (2) As discussed above, during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with water, amount of CO produced was higher, however CO 2 -hydrogen system promoted both the production of CO and CH 4 .Previously, it has been investigated that water splitting is an energy intensive process which requires most of energy for H 2 production or H /e -pairs during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with water.For example, Ulmer and coworkers 50 discussed detailed mechanism of CO 2 methanation and confirmed that CO 2 methanation is a two-step process, first water splitting for H 2 evolution which is consumed for CO 2 reduction to CH 4 in the next stage.It was further confirmed that first CO 2 reduction step is the conversion of CO 2 to CO, which requires only 2 electrons, compared to additional 6 electrons for CH 4 production according to reaction in Eqs. ( 3) and (4). Therefore, during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 , more electrons would be available for CO 2 reduction, thus more production of CO and CH 4 were obtained.Due to enrich charge carrier available, CO was further converted to CH 4 according to Eq. ( 4), resulting in more production of CH 4 .However, in the case of CO 2 reduction by H 2 O, possible competition between CO 2 reduction and water splitting exists, thus more electrons would be required for both CO and H 2 production before being converted to CH 4 .For example, during CO and H 2 production, only two electrons are required, however, CH 4 production requires 8 electrons.Thus, using H 2 as a reducing agent, CO 2 hydrogenation through single step methanation would be possible as presented in Eq. ( 1).Comparatively, photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O is favorable for CO production through RWGS reaction (Eq.( 2)), while CH 4 is produced in two steps process i.e., water splitting to H 2 and finally CO conversion to CH 4 (Eq.( 4)).In CO 2 -H 2 system, there is no competitive reaction of water splitting, thus excessive electrons would be available for reduction of CO 2 to CO and CH 4 over electron rich Mt/m-CN composite catalyst.Previously, monolithic Pd-modified g-C 3 N 4 /RGO for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O to CH 4 has been reported 41.Similarly, Pt-decorated SrTiO 3 was reported with enhanced selective CO 2 reduction with H 2 O to CH 4 51.In another development, enhanced CO 2 reduction with H 2 O to CH 4 over Au/TiO 2 has been reported 52.Similarly, CeO/g-C 3 O 4 was employed for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O and CO was evolved as the main product among CO, CH 4 and CH 3 OH under visible light irradiations 53.These findings confirm that reducing agent not only alter products selectivity but also contributes to increase yield rate under the same operating conditions. The yield rate, selectivity and quantum yield for CO and CH 4 evolution during CO 2 reduction with H 2 O and H 2 reducing agent are summarized in Table 1.The amount of CO evolved during CO 2 reduction with H 2 O over 20 wt Mt/m-CN was 253 mole g-cat -1 h -1 which is 3.33 and 5.88 times high than using m-CN and g-C 3 N 4 samples, respectively.Likewise, highest CH 4 evolution during CO 2 reduction with H 2 O over 20 wt Mt/m-CN of 165 mole g-cat -1 h -1 was produced, 5 and 6.35 times high than using m-CN and g-C 3 N 4 , respectively.This demonstrates that Mt is a promising cocatalyst to maximize m-CN photoactivity for the production of CO and CH 4 during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O under visible light.However, selectivity of CO production was decreased from 62.04 to 60.48, while CH 4 selectivity was increased from 37.96 to 39.52 when Mt was loaded to m-CN.This further confirms that Mt promotes selective CO 2 conversion to CH 4 due to more production and separation of charge carrier using 2D/2D Mt/ m-CN composite. Using CO 2 -hydrogen system, highest CH 4 production of 345 mole g-cat -1 h -1 was obtained which is 2.1 folds higher than using CO 2 -water system over 20 wt Mt/m-CN composite under the same operating conditions.Similarly, CO production with CO 2 -H 2 O system was increased to 291mole g-cat -1 h -1 which is 1.15 times more than using CO 2 -H 2 O reaction system.The trends for selectivity were completely different in production of CO and CH 4 .The CO selectivity was reduced from 60.48 to 45.71, while CH 4 selectivity was increased from 36.52 to 54.29 when H 2 O was changed with H 2 during CO 2 reduction process.This reveals that not only photocatalyst but reducing agent also contributed to increase both the activity and selectivity during photocatalysis process.Although, yield and selectivity are important factors to evaluate any photocatalytic system performance, however, these numbers could not give any information about the photon energy utilized.This is because different reaction system have different light intensity, wavelength and catalyst loading, thus yield and selectivity would be different.Recently, quantum yield (QY) is considered more reliable method to associate performance of photocatalytic systems in CO 2 reduction applications.The QY of products is the moles rate (mole sec -1 ) of a specific product to the photonic flux rare (mole sec -1 ) as illustrated in Eq. ( 5) 54. production rate (mol/sec) photon flux (mol/sec) 100 (5) where n is number of electrons utilized for the evolution of specific product for example n is 2 and 8 for CO and CH 4 production, respectively, while photon flux was calculated using light intensity 20 mW/ cm 2 at wavelength 420 nm.Thus, QY was calculated based on the number of moles produced per unit number of photons consumed for both CO 2 -water and CO 2 -H 2 reaction systems and results are summarized in Table 1.The QY for CO and CH 4 of 0.83 and 2.17 were obtained over Mt/m-CN which are 5.9 and 6.4 folds higher than using g-C 3 N 4 catalyst during photocatalytic CO The findings from this study are further compared with the literature and the results are summarized in Table 2. Zhang et al., 41 investigated monolithic Pd-g-C 3 N 4 /RGO for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O to CH 4 with yield rate of 6.4 nol g-cat -1 h -1 .Likewise, Au-MMT/TiO 2 for selective CO 2 reduction with H 2 to CO under UV-light has been reported 30.In different reports, high power of lamp and light intensity was employed but CO and CH 4 evolution was not much promising.In many reports QY was not calculated to compare actual consumption of electrons and selective evolution of products.In the current study, significantly enhanced CO 2 reduction to selective CH 4 production was obviously due to interfacial charges transfer and separation with high light absorption and efficient oxidation and reduction process in presence of hydrogen. The stability of catalyst for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 was further tested to evaluate the life time in different cycles under the same operating conditions.For this purpose, experiments were conducted in three cycles using Mt/m-CN catalyst with CO 2 /H 2 feed ratio 1.0.After completion of first cycle, reactor was flushed with nitrogen and then catalyst was saturated with feed mixture before stating the next run and similar procedure was repeated for all the cycles.The stability results for photocatalytic CO 2 conversion with H 2 to CO and CH 4 over irradiation time are presented in Fig. 10.Obviously, continuous production of CH 4 and CO were obtained over the entire irradiation time during all three cycles.In all the cycles, methane was the main CO 2 reduction product over the entire irradiation time.This further confirms suitable photocatalytic CO 2 methanation process with H 2 reducing agent in the presence of highly efficient Mt/m-CN composite catalyst.The enhanced stability was obviously due to minimum coke formation due to Mt layered structured with proficient sorption process under visible light irradiation.These findings further confirm higher photoactivity and stability of Mt/m-CN composite due to higher dispersion and faster charge carrier separation in the composite sample. The scheme of mechanism for CO 2 photoreduction with H 2 O and H 2 6)- (11).When visible light strikes over the g-C 3 N 4 surface, electrons and holes are produced as illustrated in Eq. ( 6).Due to good interaction, electrons would be effectively transported towards Mt surface, resulting in their faster separation according to Eq. ( 7).Moreover, electrons participate in CO 2 reduction and holes were utilized for water and hydrogen oxidation as illustrated in Eqs. ( 8)- (10).The CO and CH 4 can be produced by consuming 2 and 8 electrons as illustrated in Eqs.(8) According to experimental results, during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O, selective production of CO was obtained under visible light.These findings could be explained based on conduction band position of m-CN and reduction potential of CO 2 to CO.The conduction band of m-CN (CB -1.3 eV) is more negative than the reduction potential of CO 2 /CO (-0.48 eV) and CO 2 /CH 4 (-0.24eV), thus thermodynamically, production of both CO and CH 4 are favorable over the composite catalyst.The significantly enhanced production of CO and CH 4 was obviously due to layered structure of 2D Mt coupled with 2D m-CN and their good interaction for proficient charge carrier separation under visible light irradiation as demonstrated in Fig. 11 (c-d).Thus, faster charges separation and their utilization over 2D/2D Mt/m-CN composite during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction process and conduction band position are responsible for continuous production of CO and CH 4 under visible light irradiation.However, CH 4 was identified as the main product during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 under the same operating conditions.This was obviously due to effective hydrogen oxidation and proficient CO 2 reduction to CH 4 in the presence of excessive H /e -pairs over the composite catalyst surface.Thus, single step production of methane through CO 2 methanation would be possibly by employing Mt/m-CN composite under visible light irradiations and can be further explored in other solar energy applications."

    "content": "2D/2D heterojunction of Mt dispersed m-CN composite was successfully fabricated and tested for CO 2 photo-reduction by H 2 O and H 2 reducing agents in a fixed bed photoreactor.A uniform dispersion of Mt with m-CN to develop hybrid composite for proficient charges transportation with hindered recombination rate was obtained.Highest photoactivity was obtained over 20 wt Mt/m-CN composite giving CO and CH 4 production rates of 253 and 165 mol g-cat -1 h -1 , respectively, during CO 2 photo-reduction with H 2 O.However, when CO 2 reduction with H 2 was conducted, methane was evolved as the main product and production of CH 4 and CO were 2.1 and 1.15 folds higher than using CO 2 -water system over Mt/m-CN composite.This reveals that employing hydrogen as a reducing agent not only promotes selectivity but also enhances productivity towards CO 2 hydrogenation.The larger interfacial surface area due to 2D/2D structure of Mt/m-CN hybrid composite and superior charge transfer and separation governs in stimulating CO 2 reduction towards selective methane production.In conclusion, Mt can be used as a green material with m-CN to develop cocatalyst with higher activity and selectivity for solar energy Fig. 1.Scheme for the synthesis of 2D/2D heterojunction of Mt coupled m-CN composite.

(b) reveals two peaks at 284.6 eV and 288.72 eV, demonstrating C-C bond of carbon and C-N bond of g-C 3 N 4 41.Fig. 6 (c) shows peaks of Al2p with binding energy 74.21 eV, presenting Al of Mt.Similarly, obvious peaks of Si2p with binding energies 99.49 and 108.11 eV demonstrating Si in Mt as shown in Fig. 6 (d).The presence of Al and Si peaks were due to Mt in which Al and Si attached together with interlayer and galleries.Fig. 7 (a) shows UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of m-CN, Mt and Mt/m-CN samples.Obviously, Mt has strong light absorption under UV and visible light irradiations.Similarly, m-CN presents visible light absorption with wavelength above 400 nm.However, when Mt was combined with m-CN, absorption was not much altered under UV and visible light compared to m-CN.The plot of (hv) 2 vs photon energy was used for band gap energy calculation and the results are presented in Fig. 7 (b).The band gap energy for g-C 3 N 4 of 2.70 eV was obtained which was changed to 2.88 and 2.98 in m-CN and Mt/m-CN samples, respectively.This reveals that there was increased of m-CN band gap energy with Mt loading.Fig. 7 (c) shows effect of Mt-loading into m-CN for charges separation using photoluminescence (PL) analysis.The PL analysis was conducted using 325 nm wavelength.Pristine Mt shows lower PL intensity probably due to lower production of charge carrier and their recombination, confirming Mt clay did not function as a semiconductor material.Using pure g-C 3 N 4 , much higher charges recombination could be seen as evidenced by PL intensity.A decreased in PL intensity was obtained after surface modification of g-C 3 N 4 , confirming protonation reduces charges recombination rate.However, when Mt was loaded into m-CN to develop Mt/m-CN composite, PL intensity was further reduced.This confirms that Mt works as a source of electron sink, thus prevents charge carrier recombination over m-CN surface.Thus, successful development of 2D/2D Mt/m-CN composite with faster charges separation was obtained due to Mt working as a mediator.

Obviously, QY was significantly enhanced for CH 4 production due to more faster transforming charge carriers with their hindered recombination rate.Comparatively, QY of 0.96 and 4.55 for CO and CH 4 productions were obtained with CO 2 -H 2 system which are 1.16 and 2.1 folds greater than employing CO 2 -H 2 O reaction system.In the current study, Mt/m-CN composite and H 2 reducing agent are favorable for selective CO 2 reduction to CH 4 under visible light irradiation.This further confirms that hydrogen is a promising reducing agent for selective CO 2 conversion to CH 4 over highly efficient Mt/m-CN composite catalyst under visible light irradiation.
