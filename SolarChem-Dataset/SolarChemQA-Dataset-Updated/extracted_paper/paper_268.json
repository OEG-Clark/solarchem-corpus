    "content": "The Cu-doped TiO 2 (Cu 0-50 wt.) powders and thin films were prepared by following a homogeneous co-precipitation method and sol-gel dip-coating technique, respectively, and were treated through 400-800 C, and then thoroughly investigated by following various characterization techniques.The characterization results suggest that the pure TiO 2 powder formed at 550 C is in rutile phase, whereas the 0.1-10 wt. Cu-doped TiO 2 powders formed at 550 C are mainly in anatase phase.These latter powders possess low band-gap energies (3.247-3.265eV) and flat-band potentials amenable to water oxidation reaction.The 0.5-wt.Cu-doped TiO 2 thin film formed at 550 C exhibited n-type semiconducting behavior and considerable photocurrent among various investigated powders.The CO 2 reduction with a Faradaic efficiency of 82 and 96 CO selectivity in a two-compartment electrochemical cell was noted at -2500 mV (vs.Ag/Ag ) on pre-reduced (at -2000 mV vs. Ag/AgCl) 50 wt.Cu-doped TiO 2 thin film electrode in conjunction with an ionic liquid.The UV-light-induced TiO 2 was found to be responsible for photocatalytic methylene blue (MB) degradation, and TiO 2 is not sensitized by MB.The in situ formed compounds of TiO 2 and CuO/Cu 2 O were found to absorb visible light, but showed little visible-light-induced photocatalytic activity."

    "content": "A pure TiO 2 and 0.1 10 wt. Cu-doped TiO 2 powders were prepared by following a homogeneous co-precipitation technique using urea as a hydrolyzing agent 24252627.These powders are henceforth denoted as 0CDT, 0.1CDT to 10CDT, respectively, for the sake of brevity, where CDT stands for copper-doped TiO 2 and the numbers, 0, 0.1, 1, 2, 10, etc., indicate the Cu-doping concentration in TiO 2 .In a typical experiment, cold titanium tetrachloride (TiCl 4 , Fluka, AR grade) was first digested in cold concentrated HCl (AR Grade, Loba Chemie, Mumbai, India) and was subsequently diluted with deionized water.To this solution, the requisite amount of copper nitrate (Cu(NO 3 ) 2 6H 2 O, AR Grade, Loba Chemie, Mumbai, India) that dissolved separately in deionized water was added.An excess amount of solid urea with a metal to urea molar ratio of 1:1.5 was also added to this mixture solution.The resultant mixture solution was heated slowly to 90-95 C on a hot plate with vigorous stirring (pH7).Heating was continued at this temperature for six more hours, and the pH of the solution was increased to 8.5 by adding dilute ammonia to complete the precipitation and to facilitate aging.The resulting precipitate was filtered off, washed several times with deionized water until no chloride ions could be detected with AgNO 3 in the filtrate.The resultant cake was ovendried at 120 C for 24 h, and then calcined at 550 C for 6 h in a closed electrical furnace under an open-air atmosphere.The 0CDT, 0.1CDT to 10CDT powder codes indicate the powders calcined at 550 C for 6 h only unless otherwise indicated.Some portions of the dried co-precipitate cakes were also calcined at 400, 500, 600, 700, and 800 C for 6 h for the sake of comparison. The pure TiO 2 and 0.1-50 wt. Cu-doped TiO 2 thin films were deposited on conductive fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)-coated soda-lime glass (Glass Product, TEC 8, FIC Fine Chemicals, China having a resistivity of 6-9 m) as well as on non-conductive fused silica glass (Chhaperia International Company, Bangalore, India) substrates having dimensions of about 75 25 1 mm following a conventional sol-gel dip-coating technique 2425262728. Henceforth, these thin films are denoted as PTT, 0.1CDTT to 50CDTT, respectively; where PTT stands for pure TiO 2 thin film, CDTT stands for copper-doped TiO 2 thin film, and the numbers, 0, 0.1, 50, etc., indicate the Cu-doping concentration in TiO 2 .Titanium (IV) isopropoxide (TIP, Ti(OCH(CH 3 ) 2 ) 4 , AR grade, Alfa Aesar) and copper nitrate were used as the sources of Ti and Cu, respectively.Initially to prepare PTT, in a typical experiment, a transparent colloidal sol was prepared by mixing TIP, ethanol, and diethanolamine in 1:5:0.5 volume ratios.Various transparent sols prepared were stirred for 4 h at room temperature to enhance the reactions between diethanolamine and TIP, and to increase the viscosity of the sols.Both conductive and non-conductive glass slides were cleaned for 15 min each with 0.1 M HNO 3 , 0.1 M NaOH, and H 2 O sequentially in a row in an ultrasonic bath.The washed and dried (at 90 C in a vacuum of 2.5 10 -2 torr) glass slides were dip-coated (only one side) in the prepared transparent precursor sols at a withdrawal speed of 1 mm/s.These dip-coated conductive and non-conductive glass slides were dried under ambient conditions for 1 h prior to treating them in a closed electric furnace under an open-air atmosphere for 30 min at 550 and 600 C, respectively.In the case of conductive glass slides, the dip-coating and calcination steps were repeated twice to increase the film thickness 28. Cyclic voltammetry and controlled potential electrolysis (CPE) experiments were conducted at room temperature using a threeelectrode BASi (Bioanalytical Systems Inc., Indiana, USA) CV-50 W electrochemical workstation.A custom-made two-compartment all-glass gas-tight electrochemical cell (Fig. 1) was employed to reduce CO 2 in CPE experiments over as-prepared as well as pre-reduced 50 wt.Cu-doped TiO 2 thin film deposited on conductive FTO-coated soda-lime glass substrate (henceforth denoted as 50CDTT electrode) 24,28 678.The electrolyte solutions, prepared from Milli Q-treated distilled water and reagent grade chemicals, were purified by pre-electrolysis with a Pt black cathode overnight.High purity CO 2 gas (99.99), after passing through a gas-washing bottle filled with electrolyte solution, was sparged at a constant flow rate of 20 standard cubic centimeter per minute (sccm) into catholyte that was vigorously stirred by a magnetic stirrer 24,28.After about 5 min of electrolysis, about 0.1 mL of headspace gas from cathodic as well as from anodic compartment was withdrawn through a septum using a deairated gas-tight syringe, and injected into a gas chromatograph (GC) (HP5890A model) equipped with a column (1.5 m 3 mm) packed with 5 A molecular sieve to separate CO, H 2 , O 2 , and N 2 , and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD).Contamination of the headspace by air leak was quantified by determining the N 2 present in the headspace (from the N 2 peak on GC traces). Cyclic voltammograms (CVs) were recorded at room temperature over both as-prepared and pre-reduced 50CDTT electrode (calcined at 550 C for 30 min) in catholyte solutions mentioned in the above paragraph at a sweep rate of 10-100 mV/s 24,28.Additionally, the 0.2 M acid-phthalate buffer solution containing 0.1 M NaCl was also employed as another electrolyte.The potentials were recorded against the same reference electrodes mentioned in the above paragraph.Prior to the experiment, the electrolyte solutions were purged with either Ar or CO 2 gas at a flow rate of 20 sccm for 30 min, and maintained a blanket of the same gas over the surface of the electrolyte solution while recording CV.The potentials measured against Ag/AgCl in 3 M NaCl solution could be converted to the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) reference scale using Eq. ( 1) 678. The photocurrents generated in PEC experiments over 0CDT to 10CDT thin films deposited on conductive FTO-coated sodalime glass substrates (referred to as 0CDTT to 10CDTT electrodes) were measured in a specially designed three-electrode reactor cell having a flat-quartz window to facilitate the horizontal transmittance of light to the working electrode (1 cm 2 surface area) using a bipotentiostat (PARSTAT 2273, potentiostat/galvanostat/FRA, Oak Reidge, USA).The 1 M NaOH solution was used as the supporting electrolyte, Ag/AgCl in 3 M NaCl as a reference electrode, and platinum gauze (1 cm 1 cm) as a counter electrode 24,28.The light source was a Xenon arc lamp of 500 W (Solar Simulator, Oriel 91160) having AM 1.5G filter, and a monochromator (Newport-74125 model) with a bandwidth of 5 nm. The electron energy states of quasi-Fermi levels ( n E F ) of different amounts of CDT powders were also measured using methylviologen dichloride (MV 2 , E red -0.445V vs. NHE) as a pHindependent redox system 24,28.The obtained pH 0 values were converted to the Fermi potentials (which are also known as flatband potentials) at pH 7 following the Eq.(2). E F (pH 7) -0.445 0.059 (pH 0 -7) (2) Reproducibility of the pH 0 values was better than 0.1 pH units.In a typical experiment, ca.30 mg of prepared CDT powder and 6 mg of MV 2 were suspended in a specially designed glass reactor cell having a flat-quartz window (75 mL of 0.1 M KNO 3 ) 24,28.A platinum flag of 1 cm 2 area and Ag/AgCl in 3 M NaCl were employed as working and reference electrodes, respectively, and a pH meter was used for recording the proton (H ) concentration.Prior to measurements, the solutions were purged with Ar gas (200 mL per min) for more than 2 h and continued the same purging during the potential measurements.Initially, the pH of the solution was adjusted to pH 1-2 prior to recording readings using the solutions of HNO 3 (0.1 M).The light source was same as used in the above-mentioned photocurrent measurements in PEC cells.Stable photovoltages were recorded after about 30 min of changing the pH value using a multimeter (Agilent, Singapore).All the potentials are presented against NHE reference in the case of n E F 24,28. In a typical experiment, 200 mL of 0.01, 0.02 or 0.03 mM aqueous MB (Loba-Chemie, Mumbai, India) solution and 240 mg fine powder catalysts prepared in this study (each at a time) were taken in a glass dish of 150 mm diameter 75 mm height (Borosil, India) and exposed to a simulated solar light (Osram 1000 W Xenon short arc display/optic lamp, XBO, Germany, installed in a light-condensing lamp housing, Model No.: SS-1 K, Sciencetech Inc., Canada) for different time intervals (up to 4 h) 24252627.The incident light was passed through an AM 1.5G filter and the intensity of the incident light was measured to be about 44.42 mW/cm 2 .The reaction mixture solution was initially stirred for about 2 h in the dark to reach the adsorption equilibrium between the MB and the powder catalyst surface.During light irradiation, the reaction mixture was continuously stirred on a magnetic stirrer (Model: 5MLH, Remi, Mumbai, India) and aliquots of the reaction mixture were collected at regular time intervals to monitor the reaction progress.The leftover MB concentrations were estimated with the help of UV-vis spectrophotometer (Lambda 650, Perkin Elmer, Massachusetts, USA).The maximum absorption peak ( max ) of MB at about 666 nm was considered to estimate the remaining concentration of MB in solutions during and after completion of the reaction. A Gemini Micromeritics analyzer (Micromeritics, Norcross, USA) was used for Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area measurements.Phase analysis, crystallite size, and lattice parameter values of the powders were determined by XRD on Bruker's D8 advance system, Bruker's AXS, GmbH, Germany, using Cu K radiation source.To obtain quantitative information of phases, the most intense peak of the individual phase was taken into consideration.The peak heights of all the phases were summed up and the percentage concentration of a particular phase was estimated from the ratio of the strongest peak of that phase to the sum of various phases present in a given system 29.The crystallite sizes of the powders were estimated with the help of Debye-Scherrer equation (L hkl K /h kl cos A; where K is a constant taken as 1 and is the integral breadth that depends on the width of the particular hkl plane; 1.5406A, the wavelength of the Cu K source; and A is the Bragg's angle) using the XRD data of the strongest reflection of the major phase 29.The lattice parameters were determined according to: 1/d (hkl) 2 (h 2 k 2 )/a 2 l 2 /c 2 (where the value of d (hkl) for an XRD peak was determined from Bragg's law, 2 d (hkl) sin A n ).Here, d (hkl) is the distance between crystal planes of (hkl), hkl is the crystal plane indices and a, c, are the lattice parameters (for tetragonal phases of anatase and rutile TiO 2 , a b / c).The planes (101) and (200) for anatase phase of TiO 2 (ICDD File No.: 03-065-5714) and the planes (110) and (211) for rutile phase of TiO 2 (ICDD File No.: 03-065-1118) were considered while calculating the lattice parameter values.The content ratio of the anatase to rutile phase in TiO 2 was roughly estimated following the Eqs.( 3) and (4) 30. The non-calcined hydroxides formed in the homogeneous co-precipitation method (ca.15 mg) were subjected to thermogravimetry analysis (TGA)/differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) using an NETZCH Luxx STA 409 PC (Selb/Bayern, Germany), using -Al 2 O 3 as the reference material at a heating rate of 10 C/min between 30 and 1000 C in an Ar atmosphere.The percentage transmittance and absorbance of different amounts of CDT thin films deposited on non-conductive fused silica glass substrates and calcined at 600 C for 30 min were measured using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Lambda 650, Perkin Elmer, Massachusetts, USA) in the wavelength range of 200-800 nm.The micrographs of the powders were examined using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) (JSM-5410, JEOL, Japan) with an energy dispersive scanning (Sigma 3.42 Quaser, Kevex, USA) attachment for qualitative and quantitative microanalysis.The transmission electron micrographs were recorded on a 200-kV Tecnai FEI transmission electron microscopy system equipped with EDX.The FT-IR spectra were recorded on an FT-IR 1650 Perkin-Elmer Spectrometer (4000-200 cm -1 ) using KBr pellets.The FT-Raman spectra were recorded on a triple subtractive Jobin Yvon T64000 Raman spectrometer equipped with a liquid-nitrogen-cooled charge-coupled device (CCD) detector.Diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of the powders were recorded on a Shimadzu UVPC 3101 spectrophotometer equipped with an integration sphere.The zeta potentials of powders in 10 -3 M KCl aqueous solutions were measured on a zeta meter (Zeta Meter Inc., USA).Dilute HNO 3 and TMAH solutions were used for pH adjustment.The band-gap energies of different amounts of CDT powders and thin films were calculated using the absorbance data obtained from DRS and UV-vis spectral studies, respectively, following the Tauc's relation , where C is a constant, is the absorption coefficient, E g is the average band-gap energy, and \"n\" depends on the type of band-to-band transition (2 for indirect band-gap and 12 for direct band gap), h is the Plank's constant (6.626 10 -34 J-s), v is the frequency of photons 24252627.The XPS measurements were performed using a CEMUP-LAS (SECALAB 200A) spectrometer by using Mg K (1253.6 eV) radiation as the excitation source.The charging of samples was corrected by setting the binding energy (BE) of the adventitious carbon (C 1s) at 284.6 eV 24.The XPS analysis was done at ambient temperature and pressure typically in the order of less than 10 -6 Pa.Prior to analysis, the samples were degassed in vacuum oven overnight.Quantification of the atomic ratios was achieved by determining the elemental peak areas, following a Shirley background subtraction by the usual procedures as documented in the literature 24."

    "content": "The powder XRD patterns of different amounts of CDT powders formed in a homogeneous co-precipitation method and calcined at 550 C for 6 h are presented in Fig. 2. The 0CDT powder obtained from TiCl 4 is in pure rutile TiO 2 phase (ICDD file no.: 03-065-1118) (Fig. 2(a)).With increase in Cu-doping concentration from 0 to 0.1 wt. in TiO 2 , a phase transformation from rutile to anatase (ICDD file no.: 03-065-5714) is seen.A gradual increase in the intensity of lines due to anatase phase is noted as the doping concentration is increased from 0.1 to 2 wt..In addition to an increase in the intensity of the lines due to anatase phase, the presence of a new phase with small peaks at d 35.406,38.735, and 48.752 2 can be seen, which are attributed due to the formation of CuO (tenorite, syn) (ICDD file no.: 01-075-2547) (Fig. 2(b)), when the doping Cu concentration is increased beyond 2 wt..When this latter concentration is further increased from 2 to 7 wt., in addition to the lines due to anatase TiO 2 and CuO phases, manifestation of a new set of lines due to rutile TiO 2 phase (ICDD file no.: 03-065-1118) is seen.On further increase in Cu-doping concentration from 7 to 10 wt., in addition to the lines due to anatase TiO 2 , rutile TiO 2 , and CuO phases, existence of new phase with small peaks at d 31.258,35.688, 40.146, and 60.998 2 can be noted, which are attributed due to the formation of TiCu 2 O 3 (ICDD file no.: 00-017-0618) compound.Recently, Park et al. reported the phase transformation of TiO 2 from anatase to rutile for 2.5 wt. Cu-doped TiO 2 powder calcined at 550 C 15.Nevertheless, the XRD results obtained in this study are in good agreement with those reported in the literature for CDT materials 15,24,25. Fig. 3 depicts the XRD patterns of 5CDT powder calcined at different temperatures for 6 h.It can be seen from this figure that the 5CDT powder, when calcined at both 400 and 500 C, is in poorly crystalline brookite TiO 2 phase (ICDD File No.: 00-029-1360).On increase in calcination temperature from 500 to 600 C, a phase transformation from brookite TiO 2 to anatase TiO 2 can be seen together with the existence of XRD lines due to CuO.When the calcination temperature is further increased from 600 to 700 C and above, another phase transformation from anatase TiO 2 into rutile TiO 2 and an increase in the intensity of lines due to CuO are noted.The average crystallite size of 5CDT powder after calcination at 400 and 500 C is estimated to be 10.8 and 12.94 nm, respectively.These results suggest that the brookite TiO 2 phase in 5CDT powder is stable only up to a calcination temperature of 500 C, and when the calcination temperature exceeds above 500 C, this brookite TiO 2 undergoes transformation to anatase TiO 2 15.It is reported that the comparable ionic radii of Cu (0.72 A) with that of Ti (0.68 A) is responsible for stabilizing the meta-stable brookite and anatase TiO 2 phases after doping with Cu and calcination at above 500 C 15,24,25. The TGA and DSC profiles of Cu(OH) 2 -Ti(OH) 4 co-precipitates formed in an homogeneous co-precipitation method from the precursor mixtures of 0CDT, 0.3CDT, 0.5CDT, 2CDT, 5CDT, and 10CDT powder compositions are presented in Fig. 4(a) and (b), respectively.In general, all the weight loss events are associated with their corresponding thermal change events (exothermic or endothermic).The minor weight loss events seen through 30 to 100 C are attributed due to the loss of physically adsorbed moisture and the major weight loss events seen through 200 and 400 C are attributed due to the conversion of Cu(OH) 2 -Ti(OH) 4 into their corresponding amorphous oxides 24,25.These investigated CDT powders appear to be stable gravimetrically as well as thermally in the range of 400 and 1000 C, as none of the investigated powders underwent 5 weight loss in this temperature region.The total percentage weight loss estimated for 0.3CDT, 2CDT, 5CDT, and 10CDT powders through 30 to 1000 C is to be 66.13, 86.54, 40.67, and 28.20, respectively.Theoretically, Cu doping causes a decrease in the total number of hydroxyl groups associated with titanium hydroxides as Cu is associated with lesser number of hydroxyl groups when compared with those of Ti 24,25. The average crystallite size and surface area values estimated for 0CDT powder are about 17.82 nm and 23.25 m 2 /g, respectively (Table 1).A decrease in average crystallite size from 17.82 to 17.01 nm and an increase in BET surface area from 23.25 to 54.42 m 2 /g with increase in Cu-doping concentration in TiO 2 from 0 to 0.1 wt. are seen.Furthermore, when the Cu-doping concentration is increased from 0.1 to 10 wt., an increase in the average crystallite size and a decrease in the BET surface area reaching the values of 19.05 nm and 8.24 m 2 /g, respectively, for 10CDT powder are seen.These changes are attributed due to: (1) the relatively larger ionic radius of Cu (0.72 A) than that of Ti (0.68 A), (2) the lower melting point of CuO (1200 C) when compared with that of TiO 2 (1843 C), and (3) the possible existence of eutectic temperatures 15,22,28.Further, the decrease in the BET surface area with the increase in Cu-doping concentration in TiO 2 could be attributed to the increased crystallite size (Table 1) and average particle size as found in the SEM study (discussed in the following paragraphs) 15,22,28. The estimated \"a ( b\") and \"c\" lattice parameters for 0CDT powder are 4.585 and 2.964 A, respectively.With the increase in Cudoping concentration in TiO 2 from 0 to 0.1 wt., the value of \"a ( b\") lattice parameter is decreased from 4.585 to 3.785 A, and however, no change in this latter parameter value is noted upon further increase in Cu doping concentration from 0.1 to 10 wt.; whereas, when the Cu-doping concentration is increased from 0 to 0.1 wt., a great increase in the case of \"c\" lattice parameter value from 2.964 to 9.633 A is seen.Upon further increase in doping concentration from 0.1 to 10 wt., a gradual decrease in this lattice parameter from 9.633 to 9.426 A is noted.These changes in lattice parameters have been attributed to the phase changes occurred in the CDT powders upon doping with different amounts of Cu 15,22,28. From SEM micrographs (Fig. 5(a)-(f)), the presence of relatively large-size particles (chunks) with flaky type morphology in 0CDT powder, few microns size agglomerates comprising about 40 nm size spherical shape primary particles in 0.1CDT and 0.5CDT powders, and again few micron size agglomerates consisting strongly held and larger than 100 nm size spherical shape primary particles in 1CDT, 5CDT, and 10CDT powders can be seen.Further, a gradual increase in the sintering process among primary particles with the increase in Cu-doping concentration is also seen.This sintering process could be responsible for the noted increase in the crystallite size values, and decrease in the BET surface area values of these powders with the increase in Cu-doping concentration in them (Table 1). From TEM images and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns (Fig. 6(a)-(f)), the presence of 50 nm size well-ordered single-phase TiO 2 anatase crystals in 0.1CDT and 0.5CDT powders, and few microns size multi-phase crystals in 10CDT powder is seen, which are in line to the observations made in XRD study (Fig. 2) 15,22,28.Furthermore, an increase in the degree of disorder in crystal purity with the increase in Cu-doping concentration is also clearly seen. EDAX analysis revealed the presence of 6.2 atomic Cu in 5CDT powder, which matches very well with the one targeted while synthesizing the powder (Fig. 7) 242526.The chemical compositions of these CDT powders were also assessed by XPS study (Fig. 8 and Table 2).The BE values estimated for these powders are in good agreement with those reported in the literature 24.The BE values in the range of 529.67-529.89eV for O1s (Fig. 8(a)), in the range of 458.27-458.66eV and 463.90-464.52 eV for Ti2p 3/2 and 2p 1/2 , respectively (Fig. 8(b)), and from 933.81 to 934.60 eV and 954.13 to 954.44 eV, respectively (Fig. 8(c)), for Cu2p 3/2 and Cu2p 1/2 core levels can be seen.The O1s BE values between 531.8 and 532.3 eV for TiO 2 -SiO 2 , between 529.7 and 530.0 eV for TiO 2 -ZrO 2 , and between 529.8 and 529.9 eV for TiO 2 -Ga 2 O 3 are reported 24.A gradual decrease in the surface concentration of Ti in CDT powder with the increase in Cu-doping concentration is seen (Table 2).Furthermore, satellite peak values noted for Cu2p core levels are also comparable with those reported for Cu 2 O and CuO 17,18.In addition to this, Cu is hardly detectable in 0CDT, 0.1CDT, 0.5CDT, and 1CDT powders, whereas in 5CDT and 10CDT powders, the estimated Cu is in consistence with the targeted values 24.The satellite peaks located at about 8.46 eV for 5CDT and at about 7.88 eV for 10CDT are attributed to the Cu2p 3/2 spin-orbital component 17,18.It is reported in the literature that distinguishing CuO and Cu 2 O by XPS chemical shifts or satellite peaks is rather difficult 17,18,24. From FT-IR study, the presence of a weak transmittance band through 3400-3600 cm -1 and a strong transmittance peak at 1625 cm -1 , known to be due to the presence of surface The values are arrived as detailed in the experimental section. Estimated following Debye-Scherrer formula 29. Measured according to this study 30.Powder codes are as described in the experimental section.hydroxyl groups and the deformation vibration of adsorbed water, respectively 24, which are gradually decreased with the increase in Cu doping concentration in TiO 2 is seen (Fig. 9(a)).These FT-IR observations are in line with those made by TGA study for these powders (Fig. 4(a)).The FTIR spectra of 5CDT powder calcined at 400 and 500 C revealed the presence of a sharp transmittance peak at 1625.3 cm -1 , which is attributed due to the presence of brookite phase as observed in the XRD study (Fig. 9(b)) 15,17,18,24. From Raman spectral study (Fig. 10), intense bands at 150.86, 240.51, 450.86, and 614.62 cm -1 for 0CDT powder, which is in rutile TiO 2 phase, and at 68.10, 146, 205.17, 401.29, 519.39, and 642.67 cm -1 for 0.1CDT, 0.5CDT, 1CDT, and 5CDT powders, which , respectively 24,31.In the case of Raman spectra of 0.1CDT, 0.5CDT, 1CDT, and 5CDT powders, the strong peaks at about 146 cm -1 , and at 205.17, and 642.67 cm -1 are assigned to the E g modes, and the one at 401.29 cm -1 to the B 1g mode 24,31. The doublet band at 519.39 cm -1 is assigned to A 1g and B 1g modes 24,31.Surprisingly, no Raman bands are assigned to the Cu oxides of these CDT powders.DRS spectra of 0CDT to 0.9CDT and 1CDT to 10CDT powders are presented in Fig. 11(a) and (b), respectively.The presence of a single broad intense absorption peak at around 400 nm (in the UV range), considered to be due to the charge transfer (CT) from the valence band (mainly formed by 2p orbitals of the oxide anions) to the conduction band (mainly formed by 3d t 2g orbitals of the Ti 4 cations) in both DRS spectra of 0CDT and 0.1CDT powders is seen 24.The absorbance of light at slightly higher wavelength by 0CDT powder than that of 0.1CDT powder is also seen.No absorbance of light in the wavelength range of 800 to 1400 nm by 0CDT powder but by all other CDT powders is also seen.It can be seen that the 0.1CDT powder absorbed at least 10 light in the wavelength region of 800-1400 nm.Furthermore, an increase in light absorbance with the increase in Cu-doping concentration is also seen 15,17,18,24.These results suggest that Cu doping certainly causing absorbance of visible light by TiO 2 . To establish the type of band-gap (i.e., direct or indirect) energy transition states present in these CDT powders, their DRS spectral data were analyzed by Tauc's relation and thus obtained transformed DRS (TDRS) spectra for direct and indirect band-gap energy transition states, which is presented in Fig. 12 (a) and (b) 24,32.The band-gap energy values estimated from these TDRS spectra are summarized in Table 3.The shapes of these TDRS spectra suggest that these investigated powders possess indirect band-gap energy transitions states 24,32.Further, an initial increase in the band-gap energy with the increase in Cu-doping concentration in TiO 2 from 0 to 0.1 wt. and then a gradual decrease upon further increase in doping concentration from 0.1 to 10 wt. are seen.In a recent study, Sahu and Biswas also noted a band-gap energy reduction from 3.31 eV 0CDT to 2.51 eV for 15CDT powder, which is a reduction in about 0.8 eV 16.The change in crystalline phase and average particle size due to Cu-doping into TiO 2 has been attributed to the changes noted in band-gap energy values 16,24,32. The position of the quasi-Fermi level of electrons ( n E F ) (called as the flat-band potential (U fb )) of different amounts of CDT powders is determined by measuring the photovoltage as a function of the suspension pH (Table 3) 24.A decrease in the U fb values with the increase in Cu-doping concentration in TiO 2 can be seen from this table.With the help of the pH value of the inflection point (pH 0 ), the n E F at pH 7 could be calculated.A U fb value of -0.3167 V was estimated for 0.1CDT powder, which is decreased to -0.1693 V upon doping TiO 2 with 10 wt. Cu.A U fb value of -0.52 V for pristine TiO 2 powder at pH 7 measured by slurry method, -0.58 V for an anatase TiO 2 single crystal measured by Mott-Schottky method, and -0.47 V for anatase TiO 2 powder measured by slurry method are reported in the literature 24.The differences noted in these U fb values of reported powders and the present powders could be attributed to the differences in their physico-chemical properties 24.Assuming that the distance between the quasi-Fermi level of electrons and the conduction band edge is decreasing with the increase in Cu-doping concentration in TiO 2 , one could locate the position of the valence band edge by adding the band-gap energy to the n E F value 24.Potential values of 2.5553, 2.5248, 2.5569, 2.6462, and 2.6247 V (vs.NHE) for 0.1CDT, 0.5CDT, 1CDT, 5CDT, and 10CDT powders, respectively, are determined at pH 7 (Fig. 13).These calculated flat-band potential and band-gap energy values suggest that these prepared CDT powders can perform water oxidation reactions in PEC cells 891024252628. A gradual increase in the zeta potential ( ) values with the increase in Cu-doping concentration in TiO 2 is seen from Table 3.A value of -16.7 2.59 mV for 0.1CDT powder, which is increased to -25.3 2.73 mV upon doping with 10 wt. Cu in TiO 2 (i.e., for 10CDT powder) is seen.The iso-electric point (IEP) of TiO 2 is less than 6.8 24.According to this IEP value, at pH 7, the surface of TiO 2 is supposed to have a negative charge as per the Eqs.( 5) and ( 6): The increase in negative value with the increase in Cu-doping concentration in TiO 2 suggests that the pH of CDT powder's solution is increasing gradually with the increasing concentration of Cu in TiO 2 .It is generally accepted that the surface of the TiO 2 powder 0.1 0.5 1.0 5.0 10.0 exists in the form of Ti-OH groups.These hydroxyl groups dissociate into water and confer to the particles a surface charge as per reactions in Eqs. ( 5) and ( 6).This zeta-potential study suggests that the surface catalytic reactions of TiO 2 powders in aqueous medium are strongly influenced by the solution pH. Among the different amounts of CDT thin films deposited on fused silica glass substrates and calcined at 600 C for 30 min (referred to as CDTT electrodes), the 1CDTT electrode is 80 transparent in light wavelength region of 350-800 nm and absorbed 85 light below 350 nm (Fig. 14).However, in the same wavelength region, the other investigated CDTT electrodes are about 60 transparent and they absorb about 85 light below 350 nm wavelength.Further, a gradual decrease in the percentage of light absorbance with increase in Cu-doping concentration is seen (Fig. 14(a)).The transformed UV-vis spectra of these CDTT electrodes suggest that the direct band-gap energy transition states are present in them (Fig. 14(b) and (c)) 24.Furthermore, the band-gap energy values for these electrodes have been estimated to be higher than those of their corresponding powder compositions (Table 3).It is known that as the particle size decreases beyond a certain critical size, its band-gap energy increases due to quantum size effect 13.The average thickness of these CDTT electrodes has been estimated to be 180 nm by SEM analysis (not shown here), whereas the particles of their corresponding powder compositions are in the size of microns range. The cyclic voltammetry profiles of (1) the 50 wt.Cu-doped TiO 2 thin film deposited on FTO-coated soda-lime glass substrate (referred to as 50CDTT electrode), (2) FTO-coated soda-lime glass (referred to as bare electrode), and (3) pure TiO 2 thin film deposited on FTO-coated soda-lime glass substrate (referred to as PTT electrode) recorded in 0.2 M sodium phosphate buffer (NaPi) (pH 7.4) solution containing 0.5 M KHCO 3 at a scan rate of 100 mV/s from 1500 to -2000 mV (vs.Ag/AgCl in 3 M NaCl) at room temperature are presented in Fig. 15(a).A very small apparent reduction current peak can be seen from the CV of bare electrode at an onset potential of about -1500 mV, which is increased steadily as the applied potential increased in the negative region up to -2000 mV The values are arrived as detailed in the experimental section. Measured according to Ref. 28,32. These values measured for powders by following DRS spectra, and the reproducibility was better than 0.01 eV.!! Reproducibility was better than 0.01 V. Powder codes are as described in the experimental section.and there is no oxidation peak upon reversing the scan direction (black line in Fig. 15(a)). From CV of PTT electrode, the presence of an onset reduction potential starting at about -900 mV is noted, whose current is increased continuously up to -2000 mV, and upon reversing the scan direction toward oxidation potentials, two oxidation peaks, viz; a major one at about -1200 mV, and a minor one at about -790 mV are noted (red line in Fig. 15(a)).Since there are no faraday components except water and negatively charged bicarbonate ions (HCO 3 -) in 0.2 M NaPi electrolyte solution (pH 7.4) containing 0.5 M KHCO 3 , both reduction and oxidation currents noted in this CV could be attributed to the charging current that is associated with several capacitance components and/or to the reduction in protons (H ) in the electrolyte solution at potentials more negative than that of the flat-band potential (E fb ) of TiO 2 21,33.A similar kind of CV is noted for a single crystal TiO 2 electrode in an aqueous electrolyte solution, which is attributed due to the charging current that was found to be proportional to the space charge capacitance, and to the protons (H ) reduction 33.However, the sharp increase in the reduction current of this CV cannot be simply attributed to the reduction in H ions because the similar types of CVs were also noted in non-aqueous aprotic solvents for nanocrystalline TiO 2 electrodes 21,33.Gratzel et al. also observed similar kinds of CVs for nanocrystalline TiO 2 electrodes in non-aqueous propylene carbonate electrolyte 34.The smoothly increased reduction current has been interpreted as the capacitive charging current that is attributed due to the filling of the surface states below the conduction band edge and estimated the surface state density by simply integrating the charging current.The voltammetric charge during negative scan has been interpreted as two components, viz; (1) trapped charge in empty surface states and ( 2) the accumulated charge in a space charge layer 21,33.In another report, the CV is interpreted as the capacitive effect associated with the formation of accumulation layer, which is related to the surface redox process of Ti (Ti 4 e - Ti 3 ) 33. According to the electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance study by Hupp et al. 35, the cathodic current (like the one noted in red line of Fig. 15(a)) has been attributed to be due to the charge compensating cation intercalation into the accumulation region in the semiconductor film.Furthermore, for a normal n-type semiconductor, the accumulation layer is expected to form at potentials more negative than that of a flat-band potential, and the electrode becomes metallic at such applied potential 21,33.The charging current starts at a flat-band potential due to double layer capacitance that becomes constant at a constant scan rate of potential.Contrary to a normal semiconductor electrode, the observed charging currents for nanocrystalline TiO 2 electrodes were also found to be influenced by the applied potential 35.These results further substantiate that the reduction and oxidation peaks (seen in red line of Fig. 15(a)) are due to the complex capacitive components that include space charge capacitance, surface state capacitance, double layer capacitance and the charge compensating cation intercalation 21,33,35.Furthermore, it has also been reported that the onset reduction potential of TiO 2 thin film do vary with the size of the crystals in the thin film 22.A more negative onset potential is reported for smaller TiO 2 particles.In addition to this, the onset potential has also been found to be a function of solution pH as per the Helmholtz potential shift (-59 mV per pH 1) for a metal oxide semiconductor electrode, and the onset potential was found to be shifted toward more negative potentials as the pH of electrolyte solution increased 21,33,35.The absence of oxidation peaks through 0 to 1500 mV in red line of Fig. 15(a) suggests that the PTT electrode could be oxidatively stable in this scanning potential range in 0.2 M NaPi (pH 7.4) buffer solution containing 0.5 M KHCO 3 electrolyte when scanned at a sweep rate of 100 mV/s. The CV profile of 50CDTT electrode (blue line in Fig. 15(a)) indicates a reduction current starting at an onset potential of about -250 mV that has reached highest value at about -995 mV, and then gradually decreasing up to a reduction potential of about -1300 mV, and then again sharply and irreversibly increasing up to -2000 mV.However, on reverse scan toward oxidation potentials, the oxidation peaks as revealed by PTT electrode at -1200 and -790 mV are absent.However, a broad oxidation peak through -270 to 1180 mV, and a sharp oxidation peak at about 1500 mV are seen.The absence of peaks revealed by PTT electrode in the CV of 50CDTT electrode unequivocally suggests that the latter electrode might not contain any complex capacitive components.However, this latter electrode reveals the presence of reduction and re-oxidation peaks due to Cu oxides.In a recent study, when a Cu metal electrode was scanned with a sweep rate of 15 mV/s in a 0.1 M NaOH solution (pH 9) at 25 C through -1300 to 500 mV (vs.saturated calomel electrode), three anodic peaks at -410, -160, and 70 mV attributed to the oxidation of Cu to Cu 2 O monolayer formation (Eq. 7), formation of CuO from Cu 2 O (Eq. 8), and the formation of CuO directly from Cu (Eq.9), respectively, and two cathodic peaks at -890 and -570 mV attributed to the cathodic reduction in CuO to Cu (Eq.10), and of CuO to Cu 2 O (Eq. 11) are noted 36. Cu Further, it has also been reported that, when a fast scan with a sweep rate of about 100 mV/s is employed, normally, the resolution among all small anodic and cathodic peaks will disappear, and the resultant peaks look like due to a single oxidation or reduction reaction.The fast scan (100 mV/s) employed in this study could be the reason for not observing multiple reduction and oxidation peaks in the CV of 50CDTT electrode. The above CV results suggest that the CuO present in 50CDTT electrode is reduced to metallic Cu at appropriate reduction potentials and is re-oxidized back to Cu oxides upon applying oxidation potentials.However, these oxidation and reduction reactions appear to be irreversible (Fig. 15(a)) 37.This is due to the fact that at 150th scan, the only major peak due to irreversible reduction in molecular oxygen is seen as the currents due to reduction and reoxidation reactions of Cu oxides are considerably reduced (green line in Fig. 15(a)).The similar kinds of irreversible electrochemical changes can also be seen for copper oxides in the CV of 50CDTT electrode recorded in 0.2 M acid-phthalate buffer (pH 3.5) solution containing 0.1 M NaCl at a rate of 10 mV/s, where a gradual disappearance of current peaks due to CuO reactions is seen with the increase in number of scans (Fig. 15(b)).Further, a decrease in the oxidation and re-reduction currents due to Cu atoms are also noted upon scanning the 50CDTT electrode in 0.2 M acid-phthalate buffer (pH 3.5) solution containing 0.1 M NaCl at a sweep rate of 10 mV/s in the potential range of 500 to-1100 mV (the first scanning was done in the direction of oxidation potentials (Fig. 15(c)). From the CV of 50CDTT electrode (Fig. 15(d)), a reduction peak at an onset potential of about -600 mV is seen, which is gradually increased up to -1000 mV when a scanning was performed through a potential of 0 to -1000 mV at a sweep rate of 10 mV/s in 0.2 M acid-phthalate buffer (pH 3.5) solution containing 0.1 M NaCl.This solution was saturated and blanketed with Ar gas prior to recording CV.However, when a glassy carbon electrode (referred to as GC electrode), and a bare electrode were scanned in the same electrolyte at same potential region of to 0 to -1000 mV, no reduction or oxidation peak is seen irrespective of whether the electrolyte is saturated and blanketed with either CO 2 or Ar gas.These control experiments suggest that the reduction peak noted in the CV of 50CDTT electrode in 0.2 M acid-phthalate buffer (pH 3.5) solution containing 0.1 M NaCl is not due to reduction in either electrolyte or supporting electrolyte but due to irreversible reduction in molecular oxygen present in the electrolyte 21,33,36,37.According to literature reports, electrodes which can reduce molecular oxygen irreversibly can also reduce CO 2 6.Thus, the 50CDTT electrode is expected to provide catalytic activity in the electrochemical reduction in CO 2 into value added chemicals. The information about the compositions of electrolytes employed in anodic compartment (anolyte) as well as cathodic compartment (catholyte), supporting electrolytes, catalytic systems employed to perform electrochemical oxidation reactions, reduction potentials employed to reduce CO 2 , etc., involved in CPE experiments conducted to reduce CO 2 in a two-compartment electrochemical cell (Fig. 1) on the surface of either as-prepared or on the pre-reduced (at -2000 mV in 0.2 M acid-phthalate buffer solution, pH 3.5, containing 0.1 M NaCl under Ar atmosphere for 20 min) 50CDTT electrode in conjunction with a organic molecular catalyst (either pyridine or 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate, BMIM-BF 4 , ionic liquid) are summarized in Table 4 together with the selectivity of products formed and the Faradaic efficiencies achieved.In comparison with CO, relatively higher amount of H 2 is formed with relatively lower faradaic efficiency when an aqueous electrolyte was employed as catholyte.Furthermore, when the CPE experiment was conducted at a reduction potential of -1500 mV (vs.Ag/AgCl in 3 M NaCl solution) under reaction conditions as listed in first row of Table 4 (as reported by Bocarsly group 3,4), a Faradaic efficiency of about 36 for forming both H 2 and CO gases, and a selectivity of 27 for CO are noted.The liquid products formed were not considered for getting this faradaic efficiency value.When the CPE experiment was conducted again at a reduction potential of -1500 mV (vs.Ag/AgCl in 3 M NaCl Table 4 Reaction conditions employed for electrochemical reduction in CO2 over the 50CDTT electrode in a two-compartment electrochemical cell separated by a Nafion membrane together with products selectivity and Faradaic efficiencies.-2500 82 4 96 The reaction conditions are as described in the experimental section; catholyte and anolyte solutions were purged with CO2 and Ag gases, respectively, during controlled potential electrochemical CO2 reduction experiments; MeCN stands for acetonitrile; NaPi stands for sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4); TBAPF6 stands for tertiary butyl ammonium hexafluorophosphate; BMIM-BF4 stands for 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ionic liquid; FTO stands for fluorine-doped tin oxide; Faradaic efficiency () was calculated considering two electron reductions for the formation of both H2 and CO in H2O and CO2 reduction reactions, respectively, and liquid products were not considered for efficiency calculation as they were not be estimated if any.The thermodynamic standard reduction potential of CO2 to CO is -1900 mV vs. NHE; anode is Pt rod; 50CDTT stands for the 50 wt.Cu-doped TiO2 thin film. Potential vs. Ag/AgCl in 3 M NaCl solution (reference electrode). Potential vs. Ag/AgNO3 in acetonitrile containing 0.01 M TBAPF6 (reference electrode). In situ formed Nocera catalyst 38,39.!! The solution pH was maintained by adding 0.1 M HCl solution. The 50CDTT electrode was pre-reduced at -2000 mV in 0.2 M acid-phthalate buffer (pH 3.5) containing 0.1 M NaCl under Ar atmosphere for 20 min. solution) under conditions as listed in second row of Table 4, a Faradaic efficiency of about 28 was noted for same two-electron reduced products of CO and H 2 with a selectivity of 12 for CO.In these two experiments, the anode compartment had an in situ formed Nocera catalyst (CoO x phosphate) from an anolyte comprising 1 M NaPi buffer solution 0.1 M Co(NO 3 ) 3 9H 2 O over the surface of Pt rod anode 38.A continuous formation of O 2 (gas bubbles generation) over the surface of Nocera catalyst present on the surface of Pt rod anode was noted (confirmed by injecting the headspace gas into a GC).Probably, the presence of pyridine, a well-known organic molecular catalyst for CO 2 reduction into methanol and CO in aqueous-based catholyte could be responsible for the formation of relatively higher amounts of CO over the surface of as-prepared 50CDTT cathode in first row conditions of Table 4 when compared with those of second row of Table 4, which do not contain any catalytic system.The amounts CO and H 2 gases formed in the second row of Table 4 conditions are comparable with those reported by Li and Kanan over the surface of nano-Cu/Cu 2 O electrode 8. When the 50CDTT electrode was pre-reduced in an aqueous electrolyte solution comprising 0.2 M acid-phthalate buffer (pH 3.5) solution 0.1 M NaCl under Ar atmosphere for 20 min at -2000 mV and employed as a cathode in conjunction with ionic liquid, BMIM-BF 4 (20 mM) in acetonitrile (non-aqueous) to reduce CO 2 at -2500 mV (vs.Ag/AgNO 3 in acetonitrile 0.01 M TBAPF 6 ) in the same electrochemical cell, an improved faradaic efficiency of about 82-85 is noted (Table 4).The remaining lost current of 15-18 (balance) could be attributed to the formation of either liquid CO 2 reduction products or in the reduction in oxygen gas (traces) dissolved into the catholyte.When the headspace gas from cathodic compartment was injected into GC after 15 min of CPE experiment, a relatively lesser ratio of O 2 (in comparison to N 2 ) was noted when compared with the ratio noted upon injecting fresh air under identical conditions.This indicates that some amount of dissolved oxygen in the catholyte underwent reduction.Further, the liquid products formed in these electrochemical CO 2 reduction reactions (rows 3, 4, and 5 of Table 4) could not be identified due to certain practical problems 2,3.Normally, in order to identify the liquid products formed in any electrochemical reaction by a GC or by a nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy after separating them from the catholyte after completion of the reaction, the concentration of liquid products formed in the catholyte should be 50 mol (the minimum concentration that can be detected by GC).To attain such high concentrations of products in about 20 mL volume catholyte, the selectivity of the product should be very high (90).Further, if the formed liquid product is methanol (which requires six equivalents of electrons, CO 2 6e - 6H CH 3 OH H 2 O), a relatively large amount of current needs to be supplied into the experiment.To supply such currents to the small area (about 2 cm 2 area) 50CDTT electrode (which takes lesser current when compared with pure Cu metal electrodes), the experiment needs to be run for more than 24 h.However, experiments for such long periods are difficult to conduct on electrochemical workstations such as, BASi CV-50 W, employed in this study.Due to these reasons, while calculating faradaic efficiency, the contribution of liquid products was not considered. The standard reduction potential of CO 2 to CO is -1900 mV (vs.NHE).The Faradaic efficiency and the selectivity of CO formation were found to be a strong function of ionic liquid concentration in the catholyte and of water oxidation catalyst present on the surface of the anode 6,7.When a relatively higher amount of ionic liquid was employed, a higher selectivity toward CO formation was noted.As high as 96 CO selectivity was noted when 50 mM ionic liquid in the catholyte and Nocera catalyst on the surface of Pt rod anode were presented (fifth row of Table 4).Further, Nocera catalyst on anode surface was found to favor the formation of higher H 2 gas in the catholyte.In a recent study, a Faradaic efficiency of 96 was noted when CO 2 was reduced continuously to CO for least 7 h at overpotentials below 200 mV on the surface of Ag cathode in conjunction with 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (EMIM-BF 4 ) ionic liquid 5.Yet in another latest study, Bi was electrodeposited on glassy carbon electrode and employed as a cathode in conjunction with EMIM-BF 4 or BMIM-BF 4 to reduce CO 2 into CO with appreciable current densities at overpotentials below 200 mV 6.This latter catalyst was found to be selective for CO production at a Faradaic efficiency of approximately 95, which is superior to those noted over silver or gold cathode 5,6.However, Bi does not stick well on the surface of GC electrode, hence; it may not be a promising catalyst for practical applications.Further, Bi is the metal with poorest electrical conductivity. A GC profile obtained by the injection of catholyte headspace gas after completion of reaction in conditions as presented in fifth row of Table 4 is shown in Fig. 16(a).The N 2 and O 2 peaks noted are due to air contamination of reaction products during injection into the GC or due to minor leak of air into the two-compartment cell during CPE experiment.The H 2 gas has about 25 times higher response factor in TCD when compared with CO has (Fig. 16(b)).This latter graph was made using the data obtained by the careful injection of different moles of H 2 and CO gases from pressure cylinders into GC using gas-tight syringes.The activity of pre-reduced 50CDTT electrode for electrochemical CO 2 reduction was also confirmed by recording its CV at a sweep rate of 100 mV/s in acetonitrile containing 0.1 M TBAPF 6 20 mM BMIM-BF 4 (ionic liquid).For comparison purposes, the CV profiles were also recorded for GC electrode in the same electrolyte (controlled experiments).The electrochemical CO 2 reduction reaction was started at an onset potential of about -1250 mV (vs.Ag/Ag in acetonitrile containing 0.01 M TBAPF 6 ) over the surface of pre-reduced 50CDTT electrode in acetonitrile containing 0.1 M TBAPF 6 20 mM BMIM-BF 4 (ionic liquid), and the rate of this reduction reaction was increased steeply reaching the highest value at about -2500 mV. The typical photocurrents produced upon illumination of different amounts of CDT thin films deposited on conductive FTO-coated soda-lime glass substrates (referred to as CDTT electrodes) by a 350 nm wavelength light, and their corresponding chronoamperometric current profiles recorded are presented in Fig. 17(a) and (b), respectively.The 0.5CDTT electrode revealed a highest photocurrent among different thin films investigated and an ntype semiconducting behavior.A gradual increase in photocurrent with the increase in electrode potential from -0.6 V to 0.55 V (vs.Ag/AgCl) and then a decrease up to about 0.75 V is seen.These photocurrents reveal that the photo-generated electron-hole pairs are better separated in 0.5CDTT electrode in comparison to 0.1CDTT and PTT electrodes 24.Furthermore, a flat-band potential of about -265.2 mV (vs.Ag/AgCl) (Fig. 17(a)) can be seen for 0.5CDTT electrode in comparison to its powder composition, which revealed a value of -293.2 mV (vs.NHE) (Table 3 and Fig. 13).The slight differences noted in these measured flat-band potential values for thin films and powder compositions could be attributed to the differences in their physico-textural properties 28. The incident monochromatic photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE), defined as the number of electrons generated by light in the circuit divided by the number of incident photons, is evaluated at 350 nm by the means of Eq. ( 12) 24: where i sc is the short-circuit photocurrent density, I inc is the intensity of the corresponding monochromatic light, and is the irradiation wavelength.The calculated IPCE values for 0.1CDTT and 0.5CDTT electrodes to be 0.748 and 20.994, respectively.Quite stable chronoamperometric curves up to about 300 s can be seen from the chronoamperometric curves recorded on different amounts of CDTT electrodes investigated in this study (Fig. 17(b)).Further, among five different CDTT electrodes investigated, the 0.5CDTT electrode provided the highest photocurrent density. The leftover concentration in 0.01, 0.02, and 0.03 mM aqueous MB solutions after subjecting to photocatalytic reaction by irradiating with a simulated solar light having a power density about 44 mW/cm 2 over different amounts of CDT powders is presented in Fig. 18(a)-(c), respectively.It can be seen from this figure that, irrespective of the amount of MB present in the solution, among various CDT powders evaluated, the 0.1CDT powder provided the highest photocatalytic activity.When a 0CDT powder was employed in place of these CDT powders investigated under identical reaction conditions, a considerable amount of non-decomposed MB was detected by UV-vis spectral study of the 0.01 mM aqueous MB solution that was subjected to photocatalytic reaction for 180 min; whereas, when a commercial Degussa P-25 TiO 2 powder was employed in place of these powder catalysts under again identical reaction conditions, even after performing the photocatalytic reaction for 75 min, the presence of no MB was detected in the 0.01 mM aqueous MB solution by UV-vis study.The high photocatalytic activity of the latter commercial TiO 2 powder was attributed to its nano-size particles and the ratio present between the available rutile TiO 2 and anatase TiO 2 phases 40,41. To establish the effect of Cu-doping on the photocatalytic ability of TiO 2 powder formed in a homogeneous co-precipitation method and calcined at 550 C for 6 h, the photocatalytic MB degradation experiments were conducted on various CDT powders using 0.01, 0.02, and 0.03 mM aqueous MB solutions under the irradiation of light having different wavelength regions.The wavelength regions were adjusted with the help of band-pass filters, which were placed in between the reaction mixture solution and the light source.The band-pass filters used in this study allow light to pass through them with the wavelengths in the range of (1) 450-850 nm and (2) 800-1100 nm.When no band-pass filter is used, the falling light on reaction mixture possesses a wavelength range through 200 to 1400 nm.When UV light below 450 nm wavelength is employed, only TiO 2 absorbs the light, and when light in the region of 450-850 nm wavelength is employed, TiO 2 does not absorb light but MB and Cu oxides (formed in situ in CDT powders) absorb light, and when light through 800-1100 nm wavelength is employed, only Cu oxides absorb light but MB and TiO 2 do not.Hence, by irradiating with light having different wavelength ranges, the photocatalytic activity of either pure TiO 2 , MB, or Cu oxides can be evaluated.When experiments were conducted by irradiating light having three different wavelength regions, the following observations were made.No appreciable photocatalytic MB degradation or decolorization was noted on any of the CDT powder investigated when band-pass filters (either any one or both together) were placed in between the reaction mixture solution and light source.However, when no band-pass filter was employed, appreciable photocatalytic MB degradation was noted on all the CDT powders, among which 0.1CDT powder provided the highest activity.These results suggest that photocatalytic MB degradation is occurring only due to UV-light-induced TiO 2 powder.These results further suggest that TiO 2 is not sensitized by either MB or Cu oxides although these latter two materials absorb the visible light.Furthermore, although, the Cu oxides absorb visible light they showed little visible-light-induced photocatalytic activity indicating that although electron-hole pairs are created by visible light in these Cu oxides, they could not be separated effectively to perform photocatalytic MB degradation reaction (i.e., the electron-hole pairs formed in Cu oxides upon visible light absorption are undergoing quick recombination) 24252640. To assess the rate of photocatalytic degradation of MB over different amounts of CDT powders, the observed MB degradation results were kinetically analyzed following Langmuir-Hinshelwood rate constant equations 24252640.Langmuir-Hinshelwood (Eq.13) described the relationship between the initial degradation rate (r) and the initial concentration (C) of the organic substrate for heterogeneous photocatalytic degradation reaction.The model can be written as follows: where ln C 0 (ppm) is the initial concentration of MB, C t (ppm) is the remaining concentration after t (h) time irradiation, K ads is the Langmuir-Hinshelwood adsorption equilibrium constant (ppm -1 ), and k is the pseudo-first-order rate constant relating to TiO 2 surface reaction (ppm/h).The k observed (k obs ) values for each initial concentration were estimated from the slopes of straight line obtained by plotting -ln(C t /C 0 ) vs. irradiation time as shown in Fig. 19 and Table 5.When initial concentrations were plotted vs. 1/k obs , the rate constant (k) and the adsorption equilibrium constant K ads could be calculated.Eq. ( 15) can be identified as Y mX C, where, intercept, C 1/kK abs ; slope, m 1/k; Y 1/k obs and X is the initial concentration (C 0 ) of MB.Using the Eq. ( 15) and the data of Table 5, the initial degradation rates (r) for MB over different amounts of CDT powders can also be calculated.Among the various CDT powders investigated, the 0.1CDT powder showed the highest Langmuir-Hinshelwood adsorption equilibrium constant The initial concentrations and the pseudo-first-order rate constant (k) of MB degradation under the irradiation of simulated solar light over different amounts of CDT powders formed at 550 and the initial degradation rate of MB (Table 5).Surprisingly, both the values of Langmuir-Hinshelwood adsorption equilibrium constant and the initial degradation rate of MB are found to be constant over 1CDT, 5CDT, and 10CDT powders.The high BET surface area (54.42 m 2 /g) and low crystallite size (17.01 nm) of 0.1CDT powder could be responsible for its highest photocatalytic MB degradation activity when compared with other CDT powders investigated."

    "content": "The following conclusions could be drawn from the above study: 1.The 0CDT powder formed in a homogeneous co-precipitation method and calcined at 550 C is in rutile phase, whereas the 0.1CDT to 10CDT powders formed in the same process and calcined at same temperature are mainly in an anatase phase.These latter CDT powders possess low band-gap energies (3.247-3.265eV) and flat-band potentials amenable to water oxidation reaction.2. Among 0CDTT to 10CDTT deposited on FTO-coated soda-lime glass substrates and calcined at 550 C for 3 h, the 0.5CDTT provided a highest photocurrent upon irradiating with 350 nm wavelength light and exhibited an n-type semiconducting behavior. 3. The PTT and 50CDTT electrodes irreversibly reduce molecular oxygen at reduction potentials below -2000 mV (vs.Ag/AgCl in 3 M NaCl).4. When 50CDTT electrode is reduced at -2000 mV (vs.Ag/AgCl in 3 M NaCl solution) for 20 min and employed in conjunction with BMIM-BF 4 ionic liquid to reduce CO 2 in a two-compartment electrochemical cell at -2500 mV (vs.Ag/Ag ) in acetonitrile containing 0.1 M TBAPF 6 , a Faradaic efficiency of 82 and CO selectivity of 96 are noted.5.The UV-light-induced TiO 2 has been found to be responsible for photocatalytic MB degradation in aqueous solution, and TiO 2 was found to be not sensitized by either MB or Cu-oxides although these latter two materials absorb visible light.Furthermore, although, the Cu-oxide formed, upon doping TiO 2 with Cu and calcination at 550 C, absorb visible light, they show little visible-light-induced photocatalytic activity for MB degradation reaction in water. . The pre-reduction in 50CDTT electrode was performed at -2000 mV (vs.Ag/AgCl in 3 M NaCl) in 0.2 M acid-phthalate buffer (pH 3.5) solution containing 0.1 M NaCl (supporting electrolyte) under Ar atmosphere for 20 min.A commercial proton exchange membrane (Nafion, 0.180 mm thick, Alfa Aesar) was used to separate the anodic and cathodic compartments.Potentials were measured against either Ag/AgCl in aqueous 3 M NaCl solution or Ag/AgNO 3 0.01 M TBAPF 6 in acetonitrile (MeCN).The electrolyte solution employed in cathodic compartment (called as catholyte) was either a mixture of (1) H 2 O 0.5 M KCl (supporting electrolyte) 0.5 M KHCO 3 20 mM pyridine (pH 5.4); (2) 0.2 M sodium phosphate buffer solution (NaPi) (pH 7.4) 0.5 M KHCO 3 ; or (3) a mixture of acetonitrile (MeCN) 0.1 M TBAPF 6 (supporting electrolyte) 20 or 50 mM BMIM-BF 4 (ionic liquid); whereas, the electrolyte employed in anodic compartment (anolyte) was a mixture of 1 M NaPi solution containing 0.1 M Co(NO 3 ) 3 or 0.1 M NaClO 4 (supporting electrolyte) Fig. 1.An all-glass gas-tight custom-made two-compartment electrochemical cell separated by Nafion proton exchange membrane employed for electrochemical reduction in CO2.
