    "content": "All reagents and solvents were of high purity and were obtained from Kanto Chemical, Wako Pure Chemical Industries and Aldrich.Triethanolamine (TEOA) and dimethylformamide (DMF) were distilled under reduced pressure.Triethylamine (TEA) was distilled over KOH.The rhenium complex 1 SbF 6 was prepared according to a literature procedure 14. A high-pressure mercury lamp (500 W) with a band-pass filter (365 nm) was used to produce 365 nm monochromatic light.A stainless steel high-pressure reactor (17.4 ml volume) equipped with four sapphire windows, a PTFE stirring bar, a bore hole for a thermocouple, and needle valves was charged with a DMF-amine solution (9.0 ml) (amine: TEOA or TEA, 0.80 M) containing 1 (2.47 mM).Carbon dioxide was bubbled through the solution for 20 min.With the aid of a compressor, the reactor was filled through the needle valve with a sufficient amount of CO 2 to attain the desired pressure.The sample solution was then irradiated for 0.5-24 h with stirring.In all runs, the stirring speed was kept constant and the temperature was 26 1 C.After irradiation, the pressure was released and the gas was collected in a sampling bag and subjected to measurements.Reactions under normal pressure were carried out with the same reactor. The saturated CO 2 concentrations in the DMFamine mixtures under high-pressure were determined from the amount of charged CO 2 , the pressure, and the volumes of the gas and liquid phases.The CO 2 concentrations under normal pressure were obtained by a literature titration method using Ba(OH) 2 15,16; in our procedure, we used a pH meter instead of an acid-base indicator.The amount of CO was measured with a gas chromatograph equipped with a methanizer (Ni catalyst, 400 C), a molecular sieve column (5A, 3 m), and a flame ionization detector.An active carbon column (2 m) and a thermal conductivity detector were also used for higher CO concentrations.UV-VIS spectral changes during the photoreaction were measured with a multichannel spectrophotometer connected to the reactor by optical fibers.The amount of 1 after irradiation was measured with a reversed-phase HPLC system consisting of a UV detector, an ODS column, and a mobile phase consisting of a mixture (60:40, v/v) of methanol and KH 2 PO 4 -NaOH buffer (0.05 M, pH 5.9).Positive-ion electrospray mass spectra of the reaction solutions were measured by a previously reported procedure 17.UV-VIS and IR spectra of the one-electron-reduced species of 1 prepared by flow electrolysis under normal pressure were measured by a reported method 9."

    "content": "If increasing the CO 2 pressure barely affected the solubility of CO 2 in the DMF-amine phase, we would The reaction system consisted of a CO 2 gas phase (8.4 ml) and a liquid solvent phase (DMF-amine (0.80 M), 9 ml).d Irradiation time was 24 h.e The reaction system consisted of a mixture of DMF-amine (3 ml) and liquid CO 2 .There was no gas phase visually.The amount of TEA was the same as that of Nos. 6 and 7.The one-phase reaction was carried out using only TEA because TEA, unlike TEOA, is soluble in liquid CO 2 . f Irradiation time was 16 h. not expect any dramatic increase in catalytic CO formation.We therefore initially measured the solubility of CO 2 in the DMF-amine solutions at various pressures.Fig. 1 shows the pressure dependence of the saturated CO 2 concentration in the DMF-TEOA phase.As expected, the solubility increased with increasing pressure.The CO 2 concentration at 0.10 MPa (normal pressure) was 0.13 M (No. 1 in Table 1).When the pressure was 1.36 MPa, a typical pressure for the photochemical reactions, the concentration was 21 times that under normal pressure.The amine in the DMF-amine phase also affected the CO 2 concentration.Both under normal pressure (Nos. 1 and 6) and dependence of CO formation on irradiation time under various CO 2 pressures, where TEOA was used as the amine.The CO formation rate (Table 1), evaluated in the irradiation period where CO was produced linearly with respect to time, greatly increased with increasing pressure from 0.10 to 1.36 MPa (Fig. 3a).Further increasing the pressure from 1.36 to 5.57 MPa resulted in a gradual increase in the CO formation rate.The maximum CO formation rate at 5.57 MPa was 3.7 times that under normal pressure.The turnover number (the saturated CO amount/1 used) showed a somewhat Scheme 2. different tendency with increasing pressure.It reached a maximum value of 15.6 at 1.36 MPa and then gradually decreased (Fig. 3b).This maximum value was 3.8 times that under normal pressure. An increase in CO formation with increasing pressure was also observed when TEA was used instead of TEOA (Fig. 4).However, the catalysis was less stable, and eventually both CO formation rate and turnover number were lower in the DMF-TEA system than in the DMF-TEOA system (compare Nos. 1, 6 and 4, 7 in Table 1).Even though CO 2 is more soluble in DMF-TEA than in DMF-TEOA (vide supra), and TEA is a better electron donor than TEOA (pK a (TEA) 10.72,pK a (TEOA) 7.76) 18, CO 2 -to-CO reduction is more efficient in the DMF-TEOA system than in the DMF-TEA system.A similar tendency was observed for fac-Re(bpy)(CO) 3 Cl under normal pressure 10. The catalytic CO 2 -to-CO reduction requires not only two electrons but also two protons (Scheme 2).The most likely proton donor is the amine.Like the irradiation of other rhenium bipyridine complexes, irradiation of 1 in the presence of the amine causes an electron transfer from the amine to the excited complex 1 to produce the one-electron-reduced complex 1 and an amine radical.In the case of TEA, the radical species is N (CH 2 CH 3 ) 3 (Eq.( 1)).This radical can transfer a proton to give another radical and the conjugate acid TEAH 19 (Eq.( 2)). The conjugate acid may act as the proton source in the catalytic system.TEOA can act as both the electron donor and the proton donor, whereas the stronger base, TEA, can act only as an electron donor.This may explain why CO 2 -to-CO reduction is less efficient in the DMF-TEA system than in the DMF-TEOA system. To examine why the CO formation rate increased with increasing CO 2 pressure, we measured the UV-VIS spectral changes during the photochemical reactions.Fig. 5 shows the UV-VIS spectral changes of a DMF-TEOA solution containing 1 during irradiation under normal and high CO 2 pressures.When the CO 2 pressure was 0.10 MPa, absorption maxima around 394 and 505 nm appeared after irradiation started (Fig. 5a).These absorption maxima can be assigned to the one-electron-reduced species 1 on the basis of spectral similarity with the product from the flow electrolysis of 1 (Fig. 6).IR spectral analysis of the product from the flow electrolysis of 1 showed that the three (CO) bands of the one-electron-reduced species 1 were shifted to lower frequencies (Fig. 7).This shift reflects the fact that 1 has an electron on the bipyridine ligand, similar to other rhenium bipyridine complexes 6,9101114. When the pressure was 1.50 MPa, the UV-VIS spectra before and after irradiation were nearly identical, and a negligible amount of 1 accumulated (Fig. 5b).The one-electron-reduced rhenium complexes can react with CO 2 in the dark and this step is one of the rate-limiting steps in the photocatalyzed reduction of CO 2 6.The differences in the UV-VIS spectra suggest that the rate of reaction of 1 with CO 2 under high-pressure is much faster than that at normal pressure. Another favorable effect associated with higher CO 2 pressure was greater stability of 1 .When a CO 2 -saturated DMF solution containing TEOA and 1 was irradiated for 16 h under a normal pressure of CO 2 (see Fig. 2a), the HPLC chromatogram of the reaction solution showed no peak corresponding to 1 , and further irradiation caused no increase in the CO amount.Fig. 8 a shows the electrospray mass spectrum of this reaction solution.The spectrum shows a large peak at m/z 815 but no peak corresponding to 1 (m/z 635).When the reaction was carried out under a pressure of 1.36 MPa for 16 h (Fig. 2b), 11.2 of the initial amount of catalyst 1 remained; further irradiation continued to produce CO.The electrospray mass spectrum of this high-pressure sample showed peaks at m/z 635 (1 ) and m/z 815 (Fig. 8b).The m/z 815 peak can be assigned to the complex having two phosphite ligands, i.e. Re(bpy)(CO) 2 P(O i Pr) 3 2 (2 ).This suggests that, in addition to the catalytic CO formation process, photoinduced ligand substitution reactions with solvent molecules (S; DMF or TEOA) occur (Eq.( 3)); the unstable solvent complexes that are formed then react with free P(O i Pr) 3 to produce 2 (Eq.( 4)).Photoinduced ligand substitution reactions with solvent molecules have been observed in some rhenium bipyridine complexes 7,8. At all CO 2 pressures, we detected 2 , but not 1 , in the electrospray mass spectra of the reaction mixtures after CO saturation was achieved.The complex 2 probably is not able to produce CO in the presence of TEOA, because Re(bpy)(CO) 2 P(OEt) 3 2 , an analogue of 2 , was only partly quenched by TEOA 9.Therefore the amount of CO does not increase after the formation of 2 , resulting in deactivation of the rhenium catalyst. Increasing the CO 2 pressure to 1.36 MPa effectively prevents this deactivation process.However, increasing the CO 2 pressure above 1.36 MPa causes a decrease in the turnover number.We assume that the solubility of CO in the DMF-TEOA phase under normal pressure is low because the solubilities of CO in DMF and TEOA are 2.5 10 -3 and 4.8 10 -4 M, respectively 10.Therefore, most of the CO molecules produced during irradiation move to the gas phase under normal pressure.In the extremely high-pressure case, where the CO 2 pressure is raised until CO 2 becomes liquid and the reactor is almost full of liquid CO 2 (No. 8 in Table 1), the turnover number falls below the normal-pressure value (compare Nos. 6 and 8).This observation suggests that lack of gas phase forces the CO molecules to locate near the rhenium complexes and blocks the CO 2 molecules from coordinating to the rhenium active sites, resulting in a low turnover number for CO formation.Therefore, the presence of a gas phase is very important.A moderate pressure such as 1.36 MPa is desirable for efficient CO formation."
