    "content": "The theoretical works were calculated by the Cambridge Sequential Total Energy Package (CASTEP) in Materials Studio Package 41,42. The ultrasoft pseudopotential with a frozen-core approximation was adopted for the electron-ion interaction 43.The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) 44 was used for the electronic exchange and correlation.The Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof functional was used in this work 45.The Kohn-Sham one-electron states were expanded in a plane wave basis.The cutoff energy and smearing value were set as 400 and 0.1 eV, respectively.Brillouin zone integration was approximated by a sum over special k-points using the Monkhorst-Pack method 46.The energy convergence criterion was set to 2.010 -6 eV/atom; while the maximum force and displacement tolerances of structure optimization were set to 0.05 eV/A and 510 -3 A, respectively 47. The calculated lattice constants of hcp Ru are 2.720 and 4.284 A, which are well consistent with the experimental value, 2.706 and 4.282 A, respectively.The fcc CO2 adsorption behaviors at different sites on substrate were systematically studied, and the corresponding adsorption energy was defined as: where ECO 2 /substrate is the total energy of the substrate with CO 2 ; ECO 2 and Esubstrate are the energies of free CO2 and substrate, respectively 27.Therefore, a negative value means exothermic adsorption, while a positive one means endothermic adsorption. The more negative the adsorption energy, the stronger the adsorption 49."

    "content": "In the typical synthesis of the samples, bulk C3N4 was firstly prepared with urea as precursor (Fig. S1), which was then exfoliated into C3N4 nanosheets via a sonication treatment (Fig. 1a) 27,40.As shown in Fig. S2, the exfoliated C3N4 nanosheets are in wrinkles with micrometer-sized surface and nanoscale thickness. In the design of the hybrid photocatalysts, C3N4 as light harvesting semiconductor can be excited by visible light and produce photogenerated electron-hole pairs, in which electrons can transfer to the surface of metal cocatalysts for CO2 reduction reaction through the formation of Schottky junction 28. In the second step, Ru nanocrystals in fcc phase were then in situ grown on the flat surface of C3N4 nanosheets through reducing Ru(acac)3 with TEG acting as both the reducing agent and solvent, while hcp Ru nanocrystals were in situ grown on C3N4 nanosheets with RuCl3nH2O as Ru source as well as EG as reducing agent and solvent (Fig. 1a) 50.As shown in the TEM images (Fig. 1b ande S1).high-resolution spectra.C3N4 exhibits a PL emission with the maximum at 460 nm, which is quenched in almost the same degree by fcc and hcp Ru cocatalysts (Fig. 3d).In view of the PL of semiconductor is induced by the radiative electron-hole recombination, the similar PL quench degree reflects that the fcc and hcp Ru cocatalysts have approximate electron trapping abilities in suppressing the electron-hole recombination in C3N4 58.(2) the selectivity of C3N4 in CO2 reduction is evaluated to be 38.5.When the Ru nanocrystals are loaded on the light-harvesting C3N4, the average production rates of H2, CO and CH4 significantly increase, confirming the cocatalyst role of Ru in the photocatalytic process.More importantly, 4.78 mol gcat -1 h -1 of average CO production rate and 0.78 mol gcat -1 h -1 of average CH4 production rate are achieved by C3N4-hcp Ru, 1.6 and 2.3 times higher than those of C3N4-fcc Ru, respectively. Furthermore, it is interesting that the average H2 evolution rate of C3N4-hcp Ru is lower than that of C3N4-fcc Ru.As a result, the photocatalytic selectivity in CO2 reduction increases from 46.5 of C3N4-fcc Ru to 71.8 of C3N4-hcp Ru, revealing that more electrons generated in C3N4-hcp Ru participate in the photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction.In addition to the high photocatalytic activity and selectivity, the C3N4-hcp Ru also exhibits excellent stability in the CO2 reduction reaction.There are only slight declines in the average production rate of CO and CH4 during the four cyclic processes, which may be resulted from the loss of photocatalysts during the collection of them after each run and reused for the next cycle as well as the fall off of minimal Ru nanocrystals from C3N4 nanosheets during the cycles.Moreover, the photocatalytic selectivity in CO2 reduction maintains in the range of 70 to 72.2. From the TEM image of the sample after the cyclic process (Fig. S5), it can be clearly seen that most of Ru nanocrystals are still firmly attached to the flat surface of C3N4 nanosheets without any aggregation.Only a trace amount of Ru nanocrystals are detached from the C3N4 nanosheets.Also in the XRD patterns and XPS spectra of C3N4-hcp Ru before and after the cycles, it can be seen that there is no obvious change in the spectra after the cycles except the slight decrease in the intensities of Ru peaks (Fig. S6).In spite of this, it was found that the photocatalysts can be repeated for more than 15 times (60 h).The high photocatalytic activity of C3N4-hcp Ru is also confirmed by the superior CO and CH4 production rate and higher selectivity in CO2 reduction in comparison with previous reported C3N4 supported fcc metal cocatalyst structures, further showing the importance of crystalline phase of cocatalysts in the photocatalytic reaction (Table S2) 14,29,596061.It should be noted that the formation of O2 over the C3N4 based samples was also confirmed by us, indicating that the photogenerated holes left in the C3N4 also participate in the H2O oxidation reaction (2H2O 4h O2 4H ).The generation of holes in the reaction is also confirmed by ESR spectra (Fig. S7), in which ESR signals with intensity ratio of 1:2:2:1 are clearly displayed after mixing the C3N4-hcp Ru with DMPO in water under visible light irradiation, suggesting that the holes participate in the production of hydroxyl radicals ( OH) 62,63.Given the equivalent abilities of the two C3N4-Ru samples in generating and transferring photo-induced electrons, the different photocatalytic performance may be resulted from the different reaction behaviors on the surface of Ru cocatalysts in different phases, which gives a good explanation of higher CO and CH4 average production rates but lower H2 production rate of C3N4-hcp Ru as compared with those of C3N4-fcc Ru.The most stable configurations of CO2 on the fcc surfaces were shown in Fig. 5 and the corresponding parameters were listed in Table 1, while the configurations on the hcp surfaces and the corresponding parameters were shown in Fig. 6 and Table 2, respectively.It can be found that the interactions between the surfaces of Ru cocatalysts with CO2 molecules are highly related with the coordination number and the atom arrangement of surface Ru atoms.For both the fcc and hcp Ru, it can be found that the interaction energies between CO2 and Ru surfaces increase with the reduction of the coordination number 64.With the high coordination number of 9, fcc Ru(111) and hcp Ru(0001) surfaces exhibit the same CO2 adsorption energy (-0.12 eV).When the coordination number decreases to 8, the adsorption energy of CO2 is -0.66 eV on fcc Ru(100) and -0.39 eV on hcp Ru( 10 According to previous reported literature 39, based on Wulff construction from DFT calculated surface energies, fcc Ru is octahedron-like populated mainly by close-packed (111) facets, while hcp Ru is a dihedral-like shape dominated with (0001) and (10 1) surface (Fig. S8).Though the adsorption energies of CO2 on fcc Ru(111) and hcp Ru(0001) are almost the same (-0.12eV), the adsorption energy of CO2 on the hcp Ru(10 1) (-0.39 eV) is much higher than that on fcc Ru(111) (-0.12 eV).As respectively (Table 1 and2).Furthermore, there are more edges and corners with low coordination atoms in the hcp Ru nanocrystals as compared with those in the fcc ones 39.Considering the lower coordination number of Ru results in higher CO2 adsorption energy, the higher densities of edges and corners in hcp Ru are potential active sites for CO2 conversion.Therefore, the higher surface adsorption ability of CO2 as well as the higher density of active sites in the edges and corners contributes"

    "content": "In summary, crystalline phase engineering was performed on the Ru cocatalysts for enhanced photocatalytic performance in the conversion of CO2 into fuels.Ru cocatalysts in fcc and hcp phases acting as cocatalysts were deposited on the flat surface of C3N4 nanosheets, respectively.It turns out that the hcp Ru cocatalysts realize the superior average CO and CH4 production rate but lower H2 production rate in comparison with fcc Ru.As a result, the selectivity of C3N4-fcc Ru in CO2 reduction is significantly higher than that of C3N4-hcp Ru (71.8 versus 46.5).It volume ratio), which was then diluted with 1 HNO 3 .The concentrations of metal ions were then measured through a Thermo Scientific PlasmaQuad 3 inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).The loading amounts of Ru on the C 3 N 4 nanosheets were determined by sample weighing prior to the dissolution of Ru for the ICP-MS measurements.UV-vis-NIR diffuse reflectance data were measured in the spectral region of 200-800 nm with a Shimadzu SolidSpec-3700 spectrophotometer.Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were carried out on a HITACHI F-7000 Spectrofluorometer with the excitation wavelength of 390 nm.Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) measurements were performed on a Nicolet 8700 FTIR spectrometer in a KBr pellet, scanning from 4000 to 500 cm -1 .The electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra were characterized with a JESdimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) (100 L, 50 mM) in water under Xe lamp irradiation. photoelectrodes (i.e., I-t) was operated by measuring the photocurrent densities under lattice constant is 3.807 A, which is also agreement with the experimental one, 3.830 A.According to the simulation of fcc and hcp Ru nanoparticles39, the possible exposed surfaces of the fcc Ru(111), (100), (221), (211), (311), (110), (210), (310), (321) and (320), as well as the hcp Ru(0001), (11 0), (10 2), (11 1), (20 1), (10 0), (10 1) and (21 0) were used for the investigation of CO2 adsorption behaviors.The vacuum space was set as 12 A between the slabs to minimize their interaction.Free CO2 was optimized in a cubic lattice with the length of 15 A48.

(a) Average H2, CO and CH4 evolution rates of C3N4, C3N4-fcc Ru and Fig. 5.Most stable configurations of CO2 on fcc Ru surfaces.Number after the the possible mechanism of the phase-dependent photocatalytic performance in CO2 reduction reaction, theoretical simulation was carried out by density functional theory (DFT) calculation.The adsorption behaviors of CO2 on the surfaces of the fcc and hcp Ru nanoparticles were systematically investigated. Fig. 6.Most stable configurations of CO2 on hcp Ru surfaces.Number after the stronger interaction occurs between CO2 molecules and hcp Ru(10 1), which is further supported by the higher negative Mulliken charges of adsorbed CO2.The Mulliken charges are -0.50 e -on fcc Ru(111) and -0.53 e -on hcp Ru(10 1), to the higher photocatalytic activity of the hcp Ru in reduction of CO2, which is well consistent with the experimental results.It should be noted that the work function of fcc Ru(111) is 4.63 eV, much similar to those of hcp Ru(0001) (4.33 eV) and Ru(10 1) (4.38 eV), suggesting the approximate electron trapping ability of Ru cocatalysts from C3N4 with lower work function (4.31 eV) despite the different phases 14.This result is in good agreement with the nearly identical probability of interfacial electron transfer from C3N4 to fcc and hcp Ru, further indicating the charge transfer behavior is not affected by altering the crystalline phases of Ru cocatalysts.Thus the phase-dependent photocatalytic performance in reduction of CO2 mainly attributes to the different interactions between CO2 and the surface of Ru cocatalysts. Fig. 7. PDOS of CO2 on the typical (a) fcc and (b) hcp Ru surfaces with different photocatalytic performance through crystalline phase engineering. Parameters of CO2 on the fcc Ru surfaces Parameters of CO2 on the hcp Ru surfaces This conclusion is further supported by the partial density of states of CO2 adsorbed on Ru surfaces.As shown in Fig. 7, the HOMO and LUMO orbitals of free CO2 are the nCp-Op-Cp and Cp-Op-Cp, respectively.With the adsorption of CO2 molecules on the surface of Ru, its electronic peak shifts towards lower energy due to the interactions between CO2 and Ru surfaces.The peak area of HOMO orbital of CO2 decreases compared with that of free molecule, and the LUMO orbital of CO2 shifts downward to the Fermi energy level.These results indicate that CO2 loses electrons to Ru surface and the electrons on Ru surfaces feedback to CO2simultaneously.Furthermore, it can be seen that the peak shifts increase with the decrease of Ru coordination number.This indicates the interactions between CO2 and Ru surfaces increase with the reduction of coordination number of Ru, which is in consistent with the results reported in the literature65,66.
