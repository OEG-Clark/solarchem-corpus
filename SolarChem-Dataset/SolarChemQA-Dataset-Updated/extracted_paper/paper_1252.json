    "content": "The chemical reagents were purchased from accredited suppliers.They included Dicyandiamide (C 2 H 4 N 4 , 99) and Indium(III) chloride tetrahydrate (InCl 3 A4H 2 O, 99.9) from Aladdin, Sodium hydroxide (NaOH, 97) from Shanghai HUSHI, and Sodium hydroxide (NaCl, 99.8) and L-Cysteine (C 3 H 7 NO 2 S, 99) from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd.All chemical reagents were used directly without further purification.The water used in all experiments was purified through a Millipore system. Precisely, 1.0 g dicyandiamide with 30.0 g NaCl were mixed by ball-milling at 300 r/ min for 2 h, and 1 mL NaOH solution (20 g/L) was dropped into the above powder.Then it was dried in a vacuum drying oven at 60 C for 16 h.The mixture was placed in a temperature-programmed tubular furnace for calcining 4 h at 550 C, with the constant heating rate (2.0 CAmin A1 ) under N 2 atmosphere.Finally, the obtained product was washed with a large amount of deionized water for six times to remove superficial NaCl, and then it was collected by vacuum drying.(marked as NDCN) Precisely, InCl 3 A4H 2 O (1 mmol) with 20 mL deionized water and L-Cysteine (3 mmol) with 40 mL deionized water were stirred together for 30 min.Then 1 M NaOH solution was used to adjust the pH of the mixed solution until the pH value changed to 8. The resultant solution was transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, which was heated in an oven at 180 C for 10 h.After the autoclave was cooled down to room temperature, the precipitate was collected by suction filtration, washed with deionized water for several times, and then dried at 60 C for 12 h.The obtained product is amorphous In 2 S 3 . The b-In 2 S 3 /NDCN samples were synthesized by the evaporation and re-sintering method.As shown in scheme 1, a certain amount of flaky NDCN and the appropriate prepared amorphous In 2 S 3 were added to 60 mL ethanol, and then the mixture was treated by ultrasonic and stirring for three cycles.Subsequently, the mixture suspension was stirred at 80 C until the ethanol volatilized completely.Finally, the dried mixture powder was placed in a temperature-programmed tubular furnace for calcining 10 min at 330 C, with the constant heating rate (5.0 CAmin A1 ) under N 2 atmosphere.The obtained samples with different content of In 2 S 3 were named as 10 b-In 2 S 3 /NDCN, 20 b-In 2 S 3 /NDCN, 30 b-In 2 S 3 /NDCN.Moreover, the pure b-In 2 S 3 was prepared without NDCN, remarked as b-In 2 S 3 . Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were carried out on Bruker D2 PHASER.Field emission scanning electron microscopy (JSM-IT500HR) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (JEOLJEM 2100) with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) were employed to estimate the composition and morphologies of synthesized materials.The Transmission electron microscope (TEM) was used to observe the fine structure of the samples.Brunner Emmet Teller (BET) measurements were performed on Micro ASAP 2460 with nitrogen adsorption at 77 K, and the Pretreatment degassing temperature was 150 C.Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was recorded on a Nicolet 6700 spectrometer.The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were conducted on a Shimadzu UV-2600 UV-vis spectrophotometer with a wavelength range of 220-800 nm.X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out with a Thermo-VG Scientific Escalab 250 spectrometer to approximate the assessment of sample element ratio.CO 2 temperatureprogrammed desorption (CO 2 -TPD) measurement with 0.1 g catalyst was performed on micromeritics AutoChem II 2920. The photo-electrochemical measurements of required samples were carried out on a CHI 760D electrochemical workstation (Shanghai Chenhua, China).A standard three-electrode pool includes a working electrode, a Pt wire as counter electrode, and a standard Ag/AgCl in saturated KCl as the reference electrode.0.5 M Na 2 SO 4 solution was used as the electrolyte.The working electrode was prepared as follows: 5 mg of the catalyst was added into the mixture of 30 lL Nafion solution and 1 mL of ethyl alcohol for 2 h under ultrasonically scattering.Then, the slurry was dropped onto a 1 cm A 1 cm FTO glass electrode with the help of scotch tape at a rate of 50 Aml for six times.Finally, the obtained film was dried in a vacuum at 80 C for 12 h.The Mott-Schottky (MS) were recorded at a frequency of 1000 Hz under dark conditions.The light on-off cycle per 20 s was employed in photocurrent (IT-Curve) under light irradiation (420 nm), and the electrochemical impedance spectroscopies (EIS) were tested under an AC perturbation signal of 10 mV. The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 activity test was carried out at the gas-solid phase system.The photocatalyst (5 mg) and 1 mL deionized water (1 mL) were evenly mixed and dripped on the frosted glass.Deionized water (20 mL) was added to a glass reactor (80 mL incapacity) to provide adequate water vapor, and the frosted glass in the reactor was about 7 cm away from the light source.Then, the high-purity CO 2 (99.99) was vacuumed for three times alternately to displace the residual air in the system.Finally, the reactor was filled with CO 2 at a pressure of 80 Kpa, and the circulating water temperature was set at 25 C.A 300 W Xe arc lamp (Aulight CEL-HXF300, Beijing) equipped with a 400 nm cutoff filter was served as the light source.The gas-phase products were detected and quantified by gas chromatography (Techcomp GC 7900) with both TCD and FID detectors at 2 h intervals. The apparent quantum yield (AQY) of gas phase products (CO and CH 4 ) was calculated by the following formula: 20,21.For pure NDCN, the typical characteristic peaks at 13.1and 27.4b elonged to (1 0 0) and (0 0 2) crystal planes, respectively, representing the in-plane repeated structural units and the interlayer structural stacking reflection of the conjugated aromatic system 24,25 Then the microstructures topography of as-synthesized samples were observed through SEM, TEM, HRTEM and EDS, further confirming the combination of b-In 2 S 3 /NDCN composites.As shown in Fig. 2a, the pure NDCN exhibited irregular and unsmooth lamellar structure with some pores of uneven size.Due to this ultrathin structure, electrons could be quickly transferred to the surface to promote the reaction and a large number of scattered flakes, to a certain extent, provided more exposed active sites 26.From Fig. 2c, the pure b-In 2 S 3 sample presented an obvious surface fold ball-flower structure and the diameters of these balls were mostly concentrated in 2 lm.Such a kind of grooved surface rather than a solid ball structure could contribute to enhancing light absorption utilization 27.After introducing b-In 2 S 3 into NDCN, the morphology of two materials was nearly unchanged and dispersed b-In 2 S 3 ball-flower anchor on the surface of NDCN (Fig. 2e), forming a heterojunction structure.In the HRTEM image (Fig. 3e), it can be seen that the high crystallinity b-In 2 S 3 presented obvious lattice fringes with the width of 0.31 nm and 0.60 nm corresponding to the b-In 2 S 3 (3 1 1) and (1 1 1) crystal plane 22.Whereas no obvious lattice fringes of NDCN were observed due to its low crystallinity.Moreover, the elements C, N, Na, In and S were all detected in 20 b-In 2 S 3 / NDCN from the mapping, revealing that the intimate attachment of b-In 2 S 3 on the NDCN.The above results indicate that the successful construction of heterojunction, and is crucial for effective electrons transfer."

    "content": "The surface chemical states, elemental composition and interfacial interaction between b-In 2 S 3 and NDCN were determined by XPS measurement.As shown in Fig. 4a, the wide scan XPS survey spectra illustrated clearly the presence of C, N, Na, In and S elements in 20 b-In 2 S 3 / NDCN hybrid.Fig. 4b exhibited the sodium element doped from NDCN.The two peaks of In 3d for pure b-In 2 S 3 (Fig. 4c) at 452.6 eV and 445.0 eV were related to In 3d 3/2 and In 3d 5/2 , singly, indicating that the In element existed in the form of trivalent 28.In Fig. 4d, the characteristic peaks were located at 162.7 eV and 161.6 eV, which were associated with S 2p 1/2 and S 2p 3/2 orbits of S 2A state for pure b-In 2 S 3 , respectively 29.It can be seen apparently that for 20 b-In 2 S 3 / NDCN, the binding energy corresponding to the two peaks for In 3d were shifted to 451.9 eV and 444.3 eV.And the S 2p peaks also moved to the right to 162.2 eV and 160.9 eV, accordingly.Obviously, the binding energy corresponding to the two elements peaks in the composite sample has increased, implying that the electron cloud density on the b-In 2 S 3 has increased 30.The C 1s spectra of NDCN (Fig. 4e) contained three peaks, which were located at 284.8 eV, 286.7 eV and 288.2 eV, ascribing to carbon-carbon single or double bond, carbon in the form of C-NHx and sp 2 bonded carbon (NACN) coordination in the tri-s-triazine ring structural unit, respectively 31.The N 1s spectra of NDCN (Fig. 4f) demonstrated a trimodal distribution, in which one was located at 398.7 eV, the second at 400.2 eV and the third at 401.2 eV.These peaks can be associated with sp2-hybridized nitrogen of CANC (N2c) in tri-striazine rings structural unit, the tertiary nitrogen of NA(C) 3 and NHx groups connected to C in the heptazine framework, respec-tively 32.For the C 1s and N 1s spectrum of 20 b-In 2 S 3 / NDCN, the binding energy corresponding to each characteristic peak was shifted to the left.Specifically, the two peaks for C 1s peaks moved to 286.7 eV and 288.2 eV, and the N 1s peaks moved to 398.8 eV, 400.6 eV and 401.4 eV.Compared with In and S elements, the bind- ing energy of C and N only slightly changed.This may be because NDCN accounts for up to 80.The enhancement in the binding energy of C and N in the composite sample indicated that the density of the surrounding electron cloud decreased 33. Such above results could illustrate the strong interaction between b-In 2 S 3 and NDCN.The change in binding energy further indicated the flow of electrons: electrons rich in NDCN were transported to b-In 2 S 3 through the interface to form a heterostructure.While the formation of the heterojunction interface further promoted the separation and transfer of carriers.According to previous literature 34,35, the N2c as nitrogen vacancies that accumulate electrons could be used as active sites for adsorption and activation.The value of N2c/C could indirectly serve as evidence of the number of electrons in the nitrogen vacancies, and the larger ratio meant fewer vacancies (fewer electrons) 15,32.Noticeably, after the combination of b-In 2 S 3 and NDCN (like 20), the intensity ratio of N2c/C was slightly higher than that in pure NDCN (Table.S1).Therefore, it can be inferred that only an appropriate ratio can increase the heterogeneous interface while not reducing too many nitrogen vacancies.Furthermore, the element content of two pure samples was shown in Table S1. In order to explore the effect of specific surface area on performance, N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherm was used to analyze the BET surface area and the corresponding pore size distribution.As shown in Fig. 5a, all of pure NDCN, b-In 2 S 3 and 20 b-In 2 S 3 /NDCN samples were hithermost to the type-IV with H3 hysteresis loop in the P/P 0 range of 0.4-1.0,implying the presence of mesoporous and macroporous structures 36.The relevant results were calculated using the BJH method, in which the main pore size was 2-75 nm.For the NDCN, the S BET and pore sizes were 10.24 m 2 g A1 and 8.29 nm.Additionally, for the b-In 2 S 3 , they were 14.74 m 2 g A1 and 9.63 nm, respectively.When the loading of b-In 2 S 3 , both properties have slightly improved (Table S2).Taking into the larger specific surface area and rich pore structure may expose more active sites 37.Hence, compared with NDCN, the introduction of b-In 2 S 3 would enhance photocatalytic CO 2 reduction. Since the reaction requires CO 2 to participate, it is necessary to investigate the adsorption performance of CO 2 .The CO 2 temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) was regarded as a direct method to estimate CO 2 absorption capacity.As displayed in Fig. 5b, the desorption peaks of three samples presented one peak at the range of 50-200 C, which may be associated with physisorbed/chemisorbed CO 2 38,39.Although after b-In 2 S 3 and NDCN were recombined, the peak area and intensity were not as good as pure NDCN.But compared with b-In 2 S 3 , it still maintained excellent CO 2 adsorption performance. The absorption efficiency of light, generally speaking, is a prerequisite for photocatalytic reaction.The relevant optical properties were determined by UV-vis DRS spectra as shown in Fig. 6a.Based on previous literature 40,41, there was a typical absorption area around 450 nm for NDCN and b-In 2 S 3 had a wide and obvious absorption region around 600 nm.After the introduction of b-In 2 S 3 , the absorption edges of composite samples exhibited slight redshifts compared with pure NDCN, indicating that the absorption and utilization efficiency of visible light was enhanced.Moreover, with the increased content of b-In 2 S 3 , the light absorption intensity gradually increased in the visible light range of 400-800 nm.Interestingly, the long-tail absorption in the region of 450-600 nm was perhaps ascribed to the interaction between NDCN and b-In 2 S 3 16.Obviously, the improvement of photocatalytic activity benefited from the utilization of visible light. The energy gap (Eg) of materials could be calculated according to Tauc formula (ahm) n A(hm-Eg).It should be noted that the pure b-In 2 S 3 is a direct transition semiconductor (n 2), while the NDCN is an indirect transition semiconductor (n 1/2) 32,42.Based on DRS data, the energy gaps calculated from the Tauc plots (Fig. 6c) were 2.23 and 2.26 eV, respectively.The position of conduction band (CB) can determine the difficulty of the reduction reaction from a thermodynamic point of view, which could be further investigated by Mott-Schottky.The Mott-Schottky plots of the pure b-In 2 S 3 and NDCN showed in Fig. 6d both signified positive slopes, concluding they were N-type semiconductors.Based on the intercept of the x-axis, the flat band potentials of b-In 2 S 3 and NDCN were estimated to be around A0.52 and A0.94 V vs. Ag/AgCl.The value of the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) can be obtained The charge transfer resistance of the catalyst between the electrode and the electrolyte solution was determined by the highfrequency region in the EIS 44.Obviously, the arc radius in the Nyquist plots of 20 b-In 2 S 3 / NDCN film was smaller than that of other samples (Fig. 7b), which meant the lower charge transfer resistance.It can be seen that the combination of b-In 2 S 3 and NDCN accelerated the transfer of interface electrons and improved the efficiency of charge separation at the surface.The above results indicated that the formation of heterojunction promoted the separation and transfer of photogenerated carriers in the composites, thereby enhancing the photocatalytic activity. The photocatalytic activity test was carried out in a high-purity CO 2 atmosphere, without adding any sacrificial agent, and gaseous water molecules were used as hole acceptors.The yields of CO and CH 4 were displayed in Fig. 8a-c, which represented the CO 2 reduction performance of the as-prepared samples under visible light (400 nm).Between the two pure samples, they exhibited activity with CO (NDCN: 12.35 lmolAg A1 Ah A1 , b-In 2 S 3 : 5.28 lmolAg A1 Ah A1 ) and CH 4 (NDCN: 1.16 lmolAg A1 Ah A1 , b-In 2 S 3 : 0.81 lmolAg A1 Ah A1 ) generation rates.After the combination of b-In 2 S 3 and NDCN, the photocatalytic activity of composites was obviously improved.Especially, the 20 b-In 2 S 3 /NDCN achieved the maximum formation rate of CO (20.32 lmolAg A1 Ah A1 ) and CH 4 (2.12 lmolAg A1 Ah A1 ) for 10 h, and the apparent quantum efficiency of CO and CH 4 were calculated to be 0.115 and 0.049 respectively, both at 420 nm.As far as the yield of the total products was concerned, 20 b-In 2 S 3 /NDCN was 3.7 times higher than that of b-In 2 S 3 and 1.7 times higher than that of NDCN.However, it was worth noting that the activity decreased when the proportion of b-In 2 S 3 was further increased.This may be due to the excessive amount of b-In 2 S 3 that occupied the CO 2 adsorption sites, thereby inhibiting the progress of the photocatalytic reaction 21.Therefore, the synthesis strategy of heterojunction formation was conducive to the effective separation and transfer of charge carriers, which was feasible for improving the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 . In order to further determine the carbon source of the products, control experiments divided into two groups (a-b) were carried out without CO 2 (replaced by Ar gas): (a) H 2 O Ar visible light, (b) H 2 O Ar 20 b-In 2 S 3 /NDCN visible light.The CO and CH 4 were barely generated in the above experiments (Fig. S3), indicating that the carbon source of products almost originates from the used CO 2 .In addition, the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 over the 20 b-In 2 S 3 /NDCN was performed for 4 cycles to verify the stability.As shown in Fig. 8d, no significant reductions in the CO and CH 4 production rates were observed.Moreover, no obvious change in XRD patterns of the 20 b-In 2 S 3 /NDCN, before and after the reaction was observed (Fig. S2), reflecting again the fine stability of the composite. To further explore CO 2 adsorption and the reaction mechanism of the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction over the 20 b-In 2 S 3 / NDCN, the in-situ FTIR spectroscopy was performed and the intermediates at 10/30/50 min were detected by CO 2 bubbling water vapor before/after irradiation.As shown in Fig. 9, peaks in the range of 1000-2000 cm A1 were remarked.In dark conditions, as the catalyst adsorbed H 2 O and CO 2 454647, the peak appeared at 1339 cm A1 , corresponding to the stretching vibrations of m-CO 3 2A , and the peak located at 1585 cm A1 , corresponding to the stretching vibrations of b-CO 3 2A .After irradiation, the intensity of these two peaks has gradually increased and other new peaks corresponding to the reaction intermediates began to appear, like formic radical (HCOO A , 1473 and 1242 cm A1 ), and methoxy (CH 3 O A , 1416, 1113 and 1034 cm A1 ) 47,48.HCOO A and CH 3 O A were conducive to the production of CO and CH 4 .The water peak (1600 cm A1 ) increased gradually over time.Therefore, the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 over 20 b-In 2 S 3 /NDCN was a complex multi-step reaction process."

    "content": "In summary, nanosphere ball-flower b-In 2 S 3 / flaky NDCN composites were successfully prepared via hydrothermal and reburning approach.Different from most reactions in liquid phase systems, the prepared catalysts were applied to gas-solid twophase reaction and exhibited satisfactory photocatalytic CO 2 conversion performance without the addition of sacrificial agents.We demonstrate that the optimized b-In 2 S 3 /NDCN was an effective visible-light-driven photocatalyst with the excellent activity of photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 to produce CO and Fig. 1a shows the XRD patterns of pure b-In 2 S 3 , NDCN and a series of b-In 2 S 3 /NDCN samples.Compared with amorphous In 2 S 3 without calcination, b-In 2 S 3 presented superior crystallinity in Fig. 1b.The obvious diffraction peaks at 14.23, 27.43, 33.24, 43.62and 47.71matched to the (1 1 1), (3 1 1), (4 0 0), (5 1 1) and (4 4 0) crystal planes, respectively, which corresponded to the standard cubic b-In 2 S 3 crystal plane (JCPDF No. 65-0459)20,21.For pure NDCN, the typical characteristic peaks at 13.1and 27.4b elonged to (1 0 0) and (0 0 2) crystal planes, respectively, representing the in-plane repeated structural units and the interlayer structural stacking reflection of the conjugated aromatic system24,25.Combining the two semiconductors, a series of b-In 2 S 3 / NDCN presented homologous XRD patterns besides slight distinctions in the peak density.With the increase of b-In 2 S 3 content, the characteristic peak of NDCN gradually weakened, while the correlation peaks of b-In 2 S 3 gradually increased.Moreover, no Fig. 1a shows the XRD patterns of pure b-In 2 S 3 , NDCN and a series of b-In 2 S 3 /NDCN samples.Compared with amorphous In 2 S 3 without calcination, b-In 2 S 3 presented superior crystallinity in Fig. 1b.The obvious diffraction peaks at 14.23, 27.43, 33.24, 43.62and 47.71matched to the (1 1 1), (3 1 1), (4 0 0), (5 1 1) and (4 4 0) crystal planes, respectively, which corresponded to the standard cubic b-In 2 S 3 crystal plane (JCPDF No. 65-0459)20,21.For pure NDCN, the typical characteristic peaks at 13.1and 27.4b elonged to (1 0 0) and (0 0 2) crystal planes, respectively, representing the in-plane repeated structural units and the interlayer structural stacking reflection of the conjugated aromatic system24,25.Combining the two semiconductors, a series of b-In 2 S 3 / NDCN presented homologous XRD patterns besides slight distinctions in the peak density.With the increase of b-In 2 S 3 content, the characteristic peak of NDCN gradually weakened, while the correlation peaks of b-In 2 S 3 gradually increased.Moreover, no Fig. 1.XRD patterns of (a) b-In 2 S 3 , NDCN, and the composites, (b) hydrothermal treatment In 2 S 3 .
