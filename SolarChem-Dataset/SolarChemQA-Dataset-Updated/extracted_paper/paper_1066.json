    "content": "The challenge of sunlight-driven CO 2 reduction is to achieve efficient photocatalysts with exceptional molecule adsorption ability and efficient charge-separation efficiency.Herein, 3D hierarchical Z-scheme Fe 2 O 3 ZnIn 2 S 4 core-shell nanorods are reasonably designed and synthetized and directly used as a Z-Scheme CO 2 photoreduction catalyts.The Fe 2 O 3 ZnIn 2 S 4 core-shell nanorods exhibited a CO evolution rate of 37.13 mol g -1 h -1 , which is 2.15 times higher than that of the pristine ZnIn 2 S 4 layers.The upgraded photocatalytic activity can be ascribed to the unique 3D hierarchical structure, efficient CO 2 adsorption capacity, as well as improved separation efficiency of charge carriers.This work may create new opportunities for developing other high active complex hierarchical Z-Shceme photocatalysts."

Zinc chloride (ZnCl 2 ), indium chloride (InCl 3 4H 2 O), thioacetamide (TAA), ferric chloride (FeCl 3 ), polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP, Mw40000), potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH 2 PO 4 ), DMF, glycerol were purchased from Sinopharm group and used without further purification in all process. Deionized (DI) water used in all process were prepared with Milli-Q water with the resistance of 18 Mcm at 25 C. In a typical process for the synthesis of spindle FeOOH nanorods, 0.8 mmol The spindle Fe 2 O 3 nanorods was obtained via a simple annealing strategy using FeOOH nanorods as precursor 32 .Typically, the as-prepared spindle FeOOH nanorods precursor were put in the muffle furnace and heated to 350 C for 2 h with a rate of 5 C min -1 .After the reaction, the products of spindle Fe 2 O 3 nanorods were collected for further modification. Before the growth of ZnIn 2 S 4 shell on Fe 2 O 3 nanorods, the obtained spindle Fe 2 O 3 nanorods need a simple surface modification via PVP.In a typical procedure, 5 mg collected Fe 2 O 3 nanorods and 100mg PVP were immersed in 2 ml water under continuous agitation and keeping at 90 C for 2 h.After the process, the products were collected via centrifugation and remove the redundant PVP.

    "content": "Hierarchical Fe 2 O 3 ZnIn 2 S 4 core-shell heterostructures were prepared as depicted in Figure 1 via a simple annealing and solvothermal method.measurements illustrated all clear and sharp diffraction peaks can be corresponding to FeOOH, confirmed pure FeOOH precursor can be produced in this case (Figure S1a).As revealed in transmission electron microcopy (TEM) images, monodisperse 80 15 nm FeOOH nanorods with a length of 480 nm were first synthesized (Figure S1b, c and Table S1).The asprepared FeOOH precursor was then fully transformed to Fe 2 O 3 through a simple thermal annealing process in air at 350 o C (Figure S2a).core-shell heterostructures with remarkable interface interaction were succssfully formed.For comparison, the single ZnIn 2 S 4 nanosheets were also prepared (Figure S6).ZnIn 2 S 4 nanosheets possessed a specific surface area of about 28.16 m 2 g -1 according to the N 2 sorption analysis due to its ultrathin hierarchical structure (Figure S7).Nevertheless, the constructed Fe 2 O 3 ZnIn 2 S 4 core-shell heterostructures exhibited much higher surface area (39.12 m 2 g -1 ) compared to the pristine component, which is beneficial to adsorb more reaction molecules (Figure S8).Fe 2 O 3 , the binding energies of both Fe 2p and O 1s shift to a higher binding energies (Figure 3b,c), suggesting the existence of electronic interaction at the interface of core and shell 3334 .As illustrated, the strength of lattice oxygen in Fe 2 O 3 ZnIn 2 S 4 core-shell nanorods significantly decreased due to the surface of Fe 2 O 3 was fully covered by ZnIn 2 S 4 shell, further indicating the core-shell structure.As similar as bare Fe 2 O 3 , the binding energies also changed for Zn 2p, In 3d and S 2p region, but shifted to a lower binding energies after growth of ZnIn 2 S 4 3536 .The results implied strong interaction and more significant electron transfer between each element (Figure 3d,e,f).S2).The 13 CO 2 labeling experiment was conducted and the results (Figure 4c) indicated that only 13 CO was detected in the products, strongly verified the generated CO indeed originated from the photoreduction of CO 2 .The stability of a photocatalysts also is a considerable parameter for further practical applications.The long-term durability was evaluated by repeatedly run the photoreduction reaction for three rounds (Figure 4d).After three cycles, negligible deactivation compared to the initial ones was noticed, highlighting the excellent photostability.TEM and XRD were performed on the samples after cycling (Figure S9).The results proved that the morphology and structure of the samples remained unchanged after cycling. Hence, the above results strongly implied that the core-shell heterojunction structure not only conduce to largely enahnce the photoactivity but also help to preserve the photostability."

    "content": "In conclsion, hierarchical Fe 2 O 3 ZnIn 2 S 4 core-shell heterostructures were reasonably designed and synthetized and directly used as a Z-Scheme prominently improved the CO 2 adsorption capacity on the hybrid surface, which is benefited to involve more CO 2 molecules into the photoreaction process.Consequently, the Fe 2 O 3 ZnIn 2 S 4 core-shell nanorods exhibited a CO evolution rate of 37.13 mol g -1 h -1 , which is 2.15 times higher than that and 0.018 mmol KH 2 PO 4 were dissolved in 40 mL distilled water and stirred for 10 min to form a clear solution.Then, the mixture were transferred to a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated in an oven at 120 C for 48 h31 .After cooling to room temperature, the products were washed via DI water and ethanol several times, and then dried at 60 C overnight. photocatalytic products were analysed by a gas chromatograph at given time intervals (1 h) using a gas chromatograph (GC2010Plus ATF, Shimadzu) equipped with flame ionization detector (FID) and thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Figure 1: Schematic illustration for the synthesis process of hierarchical Fe 2 O 3 ZnIn 2 S 4 core-shell heterostructures. 2 O 3 nanorods were produced through a hydrothermal process and a subsequent annealing treatment using FeOOH nanorods as precursor.Then, growth of hierarchical ZnIn 2 S 4 nanosheets shell on the surface of Fe 2 O 3 were achieved via a solvothermal reaction.FeOOH nanorods precursor were first produced via hydrolysis of mixed iron chloride and potassium dihydrogen phosphate.Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) After the annealing treatment, rod-shaped Fe 2 O 3 products retained its original 1D morphology without any damage (Figure 2a, S2b).Further highmagnification TEM results revealed that the as-obtained of Fe 2 O 3 arePlease do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins composed of dense-packed small holes, confirming its original porous characteristics, which is beneficial to the adsorption capacity of gas molecules (FigureS2c).N 2 sorption analysis exhibited that the obtained Fe 2 O 3 nanorods owned a relative high Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface area of about 17.71 m 2 g -1 , further suggesting its porous structure feature (Figure S3).Before the growth of ZnIn 2 S 4 shell on the surface of Fe 2 O 3 , the obtained spindle Fe 2 O 3 nanorods need a simple surface modification via PVP.After the solvothermal process, the phase of the products were firstly investigated via XRD and further identifies that the asobtained products are composed of Fe 2 O 3 (JCPDS No. 65-2870) and ZnIn 2 S 4 with a hexagonal structure (JCPDS No. 65-3411), as exhibiteded in Figure S4.TEM images revealed that the ultrathin ZnIn 2 S 4 nanosheets are uniformly assembled on the surface of Fe 2 O 3 (Figure 2b, c) with a hierarchical heterostructure.The significant differences between core and shell indicated that distinct components in the core and shell.The energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrum (Figure S5) confirmed the core-shell products were composed of Fe, O, Zn, In and S elements.A line scan across individual nanorod showed Fe, O elements occur only in the center while the In, Zn and S are detected throughout the shell, with the strongest signal occurring at the edges (Figure 2d).High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) highlights the core/shell interfaces with a measured lattice spacing of 0.27 nm in the inner and 0.32 nm in the shell, which is corresponding to the (104) and (102) of Fe 2 O 3 and ZnIn 2 S 4 , respectively (Figure 2e).The HAADF-STEM image (Figure 2f) and corresponding EDX elemental mapping (Figure 2g-l) further illustrated Fe and O signals originated from core, whereas Zn, In and S elements uniformly distributed throughout the nanorod.All the above results indicated that hierarchical Fe 2 O 3 ZnIn 2 S 4 Figure 2: Morphology and composition of the products.TEM image of (a) porous Fe 2 O 3 and (b, c) Fe 2 O 3 ZnIn 2 S 4 core-shell heterostructures.(d) EDS line profile of single Fe 2 O 3 ZnIn 2 S 4 core-shell nanorod.(e) HRTEM image recorded at the interface of core and shell.(f) HAADF-STEM image and (g-l) corresponding EDX elemental mapping images.
