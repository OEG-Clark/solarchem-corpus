    "content": "2.1.Catalyst Synthesis.As for the preparation of NaNbO 3 nanowires, we first synthesized Na 2 Nb 2 O 6 H 2 O nanowires via a facile hydrothermal route and then converted the precursors into NaNbO 3 with similar nanostructures through a heat process, which is in accord with a previous report. 48In a typical case, 1 g of P123 (EO 20 PO 70 EO 20 , BASF, USA) was first added to 25 mL of distilled water under continuous stirring at 40 C for 2 h, followed by the addition of 5 g of Nb(OC 2 H 5 ) 5 (Aldrich, USA).Subsequently, NaOH (Wako, Japan) solution (20 mol L -1 , 10 mL) was added drop by drop into the above solution.After being stirred for 1 h at 40 C, the so-obtained suspension was transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave and thermally treated at 200 C for 24 h.The so-obtained white precipitate was washed with distilled water and ethanol and subsequently dried in an oven at 70 C overnight.The soobtained precursors were heated at 550 C for 4 h to synthesize the NaNbO 3 orthorhombic phase nanowires.The typical preparation of g-C 3 N 4 /NaNbO 3 photocatalysts was as follows: NaNbO 3 nanowires and melamine powder with mass ratio of 1:4 were added into a mortar and then ground for 30 min using a pestle.The mixed powder was added and pressed into a crucible and then heated at 520 C in a muffle furnace for 4 h with a heating rate of 20 C min -1 .The final composite g-C 3 N 4 /NaNbO 3 photocatalysts were obtained.Pure g-C 3 N 4 was prepared by heating melamine in the air at 520 C for 4 h.The Pt loading on photocatalysts was synthesized using an in situ photodeposition method.Typically, 0.1 g of photocatalyst, 40 mL of distilled water, 15 mL of CH 3 OH, and a given amount of H 2 PtCl 6 6H 2 O (0.5) were placed in a glass vessel.The reactant solution was irradiated with a 300W Xe arc lamp for 8 h with constant stirring.Then the Pt-loaded photocatalysts were filtered and washed thoroughly with deionized water and alcohol, subsequently dried at 60 C for 12h. 2.2.Sample Characterization.The crystal structures of samples were measured with a powder X-ray diffractometer (DX2700, Haoyuan Instrument Co., Ltd., Dandong, China) with Cu K radiation in the 2 range of 10-80.The diffuse reflectance spectra of the sample were conducted in the range of 250-850 nm using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (UV-2600; Shimadzu, Japan) equipped with an integrating sphere attachment.The absorption spectra were transformed according to the Kubelka-Munk relation, K/S (1 -R) 2 /2R, where R means the value of reflectance measurements and K and S are the absorption and scattering coefficients of the sample, respectively.Morphologies of samples were characterized by a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM; FEI Tecnai G2 F30, USA) and a high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM, JEM-2010, operated at 200 kV, JEOL, Japan).The specific surface areas were deduced according to the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller method using a surface area and porosimetry analyzer (V-sorb 2800, Gold APP, China) at 77 K. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was carried on a PHI 5000 versaprobe instrument (ULVAC-PHI, Chigasaki, Japan) using Al K monochromatic X-ray radiation.Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured at room temperature on a fluorescence spectrophotometer (FLS920P, Edinburgh, England) with an excitation wavelength of 350 nm. 2.3.Photocatalytic Activity Test.The photoreduction of CO 2 into CH 4 was carried out in a Pyrex glass vessel.The sample (50 mg) was uniformly and evenly dispersed on the bottom of a small glass cell that was located in the bottom of a Pyrex glass cell, which was connected with a closed system.The volume of the reaction system was about 230 mL.A 300 W xenon arc lamp was used as the light source of the photocatalytic reaction.The reaction setup was vacuum-treated several times, and then the high purity of CO 2 gas was followed into the reaction setup for reaching ambient pressure.After replacing the system air into CO 2 , a total of 2 mL of H 2 O was injected into the reactor with a liquid syringe.A gas pump was used to accelerate gas diffusion.Subsequently, the reactor was stored under dark conditions for 2 h to ensure that an adsorption-desorption equilibrium was reached.Finally, the reactor was irradiated from a 300-W Xe lamp quipped with a UV cutoff filter ( 420 nm).During irradiation, a gaseous sample (0.5 mL) was continually extracted from the reaction cell at a given interval to check the concentration of CH 4 using a gas chromatograph (GC-9790A, Fuli, China)."

    "content": "3.1.Characterization of g-C 3 N 4 /NaNbO 3 Heterojunctions.The powder XRD patterns of the as-prepared g-C 3 N 4 , NaNbO 3 , and g-C 3 N 4 /NaNbO 3 composite samples are presented in Figure 1.The two distinct peaks located at 27.4and 13.1of the pure g-C 3 N 4 sample could be indexed as (002) and (100) diffraction planes (JCPDS 87-1526), corresponding to the characteristic interplanar staking peaks of aromatic systems and the interlayer structural packing, respectively.No impurity phase was observed in the NaNbO 3 sample, which was consistent with the XRD pattern of orthorhombic structured NaNbO 3 in the JCPDS card (no.01-072-7753).The XRD patterns of g-C 3 N 4 /NaNbO 3 revealed coexistence peaks of NaNbO 3 and g-C 3 N 4 in the composite.Hence the heterojunction was composed of two phases: g-C 3 N 4 and NaNbO 3 . Figure 2 shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of NaNbO 3 , g-C 3 N 4 , and g-C 3 N 4 /NaNbO 3 , which are transformed from the diffuse reflection spectra according to the Kubelka-Munk theory.The absorbance threshold of NaNbO 3 was located at approximately 365 nm, whereas the g-C 3 N 4 sample could absorb solar energy with a wavelength up to 450 nm.The band gaps of photocatalysts were generally obtained according to the relationship E g 1240/, where E g is the band gap energy and is the cutoff wavelength of the photocatalyst.Thus, the band gaps of as-prepared NaNbO 3 and g-C 3 N 4 were determined to be 3.4 and 2.7 eV, respectively, which were consistent with the values in previous reports. 33,48The g-C 3 N 4 /NaNbO 3 composite sample exhibited a similar tail optical absorption edge up to 450 nm.This clearly demonstrated that g-C 3 N 4 /NaNbO 3 had potential applications in the visible-light region. The morphologies and microstructures of g-C 3 N 4 , NaNbO 3 , and g-C 3 N 4 /NaNbO 3 samples were investigated with field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM).Figure 3 shows the FE-SEM images of pure g-C 3 N 4 , NaNbO 3 , and g-C 3 N 4 /NaNbO 3 heterojunctions.It is revealed that g-C 3 N 4 displays an aggregated layered structure with several stacking layers (Figure 3a).The NaNbO 3 sample displays a number of nanowires with a uniform diameter of 200 nm and length of up to several tens of micrometers (Figure 3b).As shown in Figure 3c, after introducing NaNbO 3 , amounts of NaNbO 3 nanowires are found to randomly deposit and distribute on the surface of g-C 3 N 4 sheets, which results in forming a heterostructured g-C 3 N 4 /NaNbO 3 material.Further EDX analysis (see Figure S1) indicates that the composite sample is composed of Na, Nb, C, N, and O atoms.Additionally, the intensity of the nitrogen peak in Figure S1a is notably higher than that in Figure S1b, indicating that zones a and b in FE-SEM images are mainly C 3 N 4 and NaNbO 3 nanowires, respectively. To get further information concerning the microstructures of the g-C 3 N 4 /NaNbO 3 , high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) analysis was performed.The low-and high-magnification transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the as-prepared samples are shown in Figure 4. Given the observed morphology of NaNbO 3 in the SEM image, the dark parts in the TEM image (Figure 4a) should be NaNbO 3 , while the light parts correspond to C 3 N 4 , which further demonstrates that NaNbO 3 nanowires have covered the surface of C 3 N 4 .In addition, it is worthwhile to note that the ultrasonication treatment during the TEM preparation procedure does not peel off these nanowires (Figure 4a) owing to the strong interaction between g-C 3 N 4 and NaNbO 3 in the heterojunctions.From the high-resolution TEM image of the g-C 3 N 4 /NaNbO 3 heterojunction (Figure 4b), smooth and intimate interfaces are obviously observed between the g-C 3 N 4 and NaNbO 3 , which confirms the formation of g-C 3 N 4 / NaNbO 3 heterojunctions.Moreover, this result also implies that g-C 3 N 4 /NaNbO 3 is heterogeneous in structure rather than a physical mixture of two separate phases of g-C 3 N 4 and NaNbO 3 .The clear lattice fringe in HRTEM (Figure 4c) should be ascribed to NaNbO 3 , and the d spacing values are 0.39 and 0.27 nm, corresponding to the (101) and (002) planes of orthorhombic-structured NaNbO 3 , respectively.The observed interface is possibly favorable for the photoinducedcarriers transfer between C 3 N 4 and NaNbO 3 and thereby promotes the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. The surface chemical compositions and states of the g-C 3 N 4 , NaNbO 3 , and g-C 3 N 4 /NaNbO 3 were further investigated by Xray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) in order to clarify the interactions of NaNbO 3 with the g-C 3 N 4 .As shown in the survey scan XPS spectra (Figure S2a), C 1s and N 1s peaks were observed for g-C 3 N 4 and g-C 3 N 4 /NaNbO 3 , while Na 1s, Nb 3d, and O 1s peaks were displayed for NaNbO 3 and g-C 3 N 4 /NaNbO 3 .These characteristic peaks were undoubtedly consistent with chemical composition of the photocatalysts.As shown in the high resolution XPS spectra of C 1s (Figure S2b), as for g-C 3 N 4 , the two strong peaks located at 284.4 and 287.7 eV could be assigned to sp 2 C-C bonds and sp 2 -bonded carbon in N-containing aromatic rings (N-CN), respectively, which are considered the major carbon species in the g-C 3 N 4 . 52,53The g-C 3 N 4 /NaNbO 3 composite displayed slightly lower binding energies of C 1s (284.3 and 287.6 eV) than that of pure g-C 3 N 4 , which was due to the fact that NaNbO 3 hybridized with g-C 3 N 4 and thus led to the inner shift of C 1s.As shown in Figure S2c, the N 1s peaks located at 398.2 eV (g-C 3 N 4 ) and 398.1 eV (g-C 3 N 4 /NaNbO 3 ) originated from C N-C coordination. 54In addition, the peak located at 1072.0 eV corresponded to the binding energy of Na 1s in NaNbO 3 , 55 whereas the peak of g-C 3 N 4 /NaNbO 3 (1071.5eV) was lower than that of pure NaNbO 3 (see Figure S 2d).Such a similar experimental phenomenon was also observed from the XPS spectra of Nb 3d (Figure S2e) and O 1s (Figure S 2f) peaks.That is, the binding energies of Nb 3d 3/2 (209.1 eV), Nb 3d 5/2 (206.6 eV), and O 1s (529.9 eV) of g-C 3 N 4 /NaNbO 3 were lower than those of Nb 3d 3/2 (210.4 eV), Nb 3d 5/2 (207.7 eV), and O 1s (530.6 eV) of pure NaNbO 3 .XPS results implied the existence of chemical bonds in the g-C 3 N 4 /NaNbO 3 heterojunction. 56.2.Photocatalytic Activity of g-C 3 N 4 /NaNbO 3 Heterojunction.In the present study, the CO 2 photoreduction experiments were carried out in the gaseous phase to evaluate the photocatalytic properties of as-prepared photocatalysts.Figure 5 shows the CH 4 evolution rates over Pt loaded NaNbO 3 , g-C 3 N 4 , and g-C 3 N 4 /NaNbO 3 composite photocatalysts and the BET surface areas.It was found that NaNbO 3 nanowires (12.0 m 2 g -1 ) had a slightly larger surface area than g-C 3 N 4 (6.5 m 2 g -1 ).When g-C 3 N 4 was introduced into NaNbO 3 nanowires, the surface area of g-C 3 N 4 -NaNbO 3 heterojunctions (10.7 m 2 g -1 ) was similar to that of NaNbO 3 .During the first 4 h of irradiation, the rate of CH 4 generation over Pt-g-C 3 N 4 /NaNbO 3 was as high as 6.4 mol h -1 g -1 in contrast to that of Pt-g-C 3 N 4 (0.8 mol h -1 g -1 ).The heterojunction photocatalyst notably enhanced the photocatalytic performance compared with the naked photocatalyst.Namely, g-C 3 N 4 /NaNbO 3 improved over 8-fold higher activity than that of naked C 3 N 4 .In order to investigate the photocatalytic repeatability of the catalyst, the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 over the used Pt-g-C 3 N 4 /NaNbO 3 sample was performed again.It was revealed that the photocatalytic activity of the used sample was similar to that of the fresh sample (see Figure S3). Figure 6 shows a comparison of the XRD patterns of pt-g-C 3 N 4 /NaNbO 3 before and after the photocatalytic reaction.There was no obvious peak change in the XRD patterns of pt-g-C 3 N 4 /NaNbO 3 before and after the photocatalytic reaction, indicating that the phase of the g-C 3 N 4 /NaNbO 3 catalyst was a stable photocatalyst without occurrence of structural degradation during the present photocatalytic reaction process. 3.3.Possible Photocatalytic Mechanism of g-C 3 N 4 / NaNbO 3 Heterojunctions.One can see that, although g-C 3 N 4 /NaNbO 3 and g-C 3 N 4 have similar optical absorption and comparable surface areas, their photocatalytic activities in the photoreduction of CO 2 are apparently different.This implies that there should be another crucial factor that influences the photocatalytic activities notably.Actually, in addition to the optical absorption and surface area, the efficient charge separation of a semiconductor usually plays a crucial role in determining its photocatalytic property.Herein, band potentials of g-C 3 N 4 and NaNbO 3 were investigated in order to clarify the charge separation in g-C 3 N 4 /NaNbO 3 interfaces. The band edge positions of photocatalysts were theoretically speculated using the equation related to Mulliken electronegativity 57585960 and the band gap of a semiconductor, which is described by (1) where E CB and E VB are the bottom conduction band (CB) and the top of the valence band (VB) relative to the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) and E g means the band gap energy of the photocatalyst, E e is the energy of free electrons (4.5 eV), and X (X (X 1 X 2 X 3 ....X n ) 1/n ) is the geometric mean of the Mulliken electronegativity of the constituent atoms in the semiconductor.The Mulliken electronegativity of an atom is the arithmetic mean of the atomic electron affinity and the first ionization energy.Subsequently, E CB of NaNbO 3 is determined to be -0.77eV relative to the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) in the view of the method inherent error (0.2 eV), 57 and the VB edge of NaNbO 3 is determined to be 2.63 eV from the band gap.The CB and VB edge potentials of g-C 3 N 4 are determined to be -1.13 and 1.57 eV, respectively.In addition, the valence band X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (VB-XPS) was further preformed to investigate the VB top of g-C 3 N 4 and NaNbO 3 .As shown in Figure 7, it could be seen that the positions of the valence band edge of g-C 3 N 4 and NaNbO 3 were located at 1.5 and 2.7 eV, respectively, which were consistent with the theoretical calculated results.Thus, it could be concluded that the VB top of NaNbO 3 is lower than that of g-C 3 N 4 , while the CB bottom of C 3 N 4 is higher than that of NaNbO 3 .On the basis of the above results and previous reports, 6162636465666768 a possible mechanism for the enhanced photocatalytic activity over the present g-C 3 N 4 /NaNbO 3 is shown schematically in Figure 8.The g-C 3 N 4 in the heterostructured photocatalysts acts as a sensitizer to absorb photons as well as excite electron and hole pairs upon light irradiation.Since the CB edge potential of g-C 3 N 4 (-1.13 eV) is more negative than In order to support above-proposed mechanism, we performed photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy measurements to analyze the electron-hole pairs' recombination for g-C 3 N 4 and g-C 3 N 4 /NaNbO 3 .It is generally acknowledged that the higher fluorescence intensity means more recombination of electron-hole pairs and lower photocatalytic activities. 69As shown in Figure 9, pure g-C 3 N 4 excited at 350 nm had a main emission peak at about 460 nm, which was similar to the previous reports. 35,70For g-C 3 N 4 /NaNbO 3 , the emission intensity was much lower than that of pure g-C 3 N 4 at a similar emission position, suggesting that the composites had a much lower recombination rate of photogenerated charge carriers.As mentioned above, it possibly originated from the charge transfer between g-C 3 N 4 and NaNbO 3 .In addition, the network structure of g-C 3 N 4 could act as an excellent electron transport platform to facilitate the charge transfer process. 36,37ll these suggest some useful information to design an efficient photocatalysts for CO 2 reduction."

    "content": "In this study, we have successfully developed a visible-lightresponsive g-C 3 N 4 /NaNbO 3 nanowire heterojunction photocatalyst via introducing polymeric g-C 3 N 4 on NaNbO 3 nanowires.High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) revealed that an intimate interface between C 3 N 4 and NaNbO 3 nanowires formed in the heterojunctions.The resulting g-C 3 N 4 /NaNbO 3 nanowire heterojunctions owned strong absorption ability in the visible light region and had obviously enhanced photocatalytic activities for the CO 2 photoreduction.The photocatalytic activity of the g-C 3 N 4 / NaNbO 3 heterojunction for the CO 2 reduction was almost 8 times higher than that of individual C 3 N 4 under visible light irradiation.Such a remarkable enhancement of photocatalytic activity was mainly attributed to the improved separation and transfer of photogenerated electron-hole pairs at the intimate interface of g-C 3 N 4 /NaNbO 3 heterojunctions, which could be ascribed to the well-aligned overlapping band structures of C 3 N 4 and NaNbO 3 .In summary, the present research is expected to be useful in development of new heterojunction photocatalysts and provide some meaningful information for photocatalytic CO 2 conversion.
