    "content": "3.1.Compositional and Structural Characterization.The ZnIn 2 S 4 /BiVO 4 composite were fabricated by assembling ZnIn 2 S 4 nanosheets onto the surface of decahedral BiVO 4 , as schematically illustrated in Figure 1.The X-ray diffraction peaks of the applied decahedral BiVO 4 matches very well with monoclinic phase (JCPDS, No. 14-0688), whereas the diffraction signals of ZnIn 2 S 4 can be assigned to the hexagonal phase (JCPDS, No.72-0773) (Figure S1).For the ZnIn 2 S 4 / BiVO 4 composites, both BiVO 4 and ZnIn 2 S 4 phases are The typical FE-SEM image reveals that as-prepared BiVO 4 exhibits regular decahedron shape with 5-6 m in size and a relatively smooth surface (Figure 1a and Figure S2a 1 -a 2 ).The individual ZnIn 2 S 4 displays flower-like hierarchical microsphere architectures with the diameter of 500-600 nm, entirely consisting of ultrathin 2D nanosheets with a few nanometers thick (Figure 1b and Figure S2b 2e).The high-resolution TEM image reveals that the apparent lattice fringes with interplanar spacing of 2.2 and 2.5 A are in good accord with the (100) plane and (002) planes of the hexagonal ZnIn 2 S 4 phase and monoclinic BiVO 4 phase, respectively (Figure 2f).Indeed, the corresponding selective area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern displays two types of characteristic spots, i.e., (010) and (100) planes of hexagonalphase ZnIn 2 S 4 , and (002) planes of monoclinic BiVO 4 (Figure 2g).The corresponding EDX elemental maps of the ZnIn 2 S 4 / BiVO 4 composite confirm the presence of Bi, V, O, Zn, In, and S (Figure 2h). Figure S5a shows the full-scale XPS of BiVO 4 , ZnIn 2 S 4 , and ZnIn 2 S 4 /BiVO 4 -2.The ZnIn 2 S 4 /BiVO 4 nanocomposite is mainly composed of Bi, V, O, Zn, In, and S. To determine chemical valence states of various component elements, we comparatively analyzed the high-resolution XPS spectra.Binding energy peaks of the individual BiVO 4 at 164.1 and 158.7 eV are confirmed for Bi 4f 5/2 and Bi 4f 7/2 states (Figure S5b), and V 2p 1/2 and V 2p 3/2 states are surveyed at 524.0 and 516.4 eV (Figure S5c).The characteristic peaks observed at 1021.5 and 1044.4 eV for individual ZnIn 2 S 4 could be allocated to Zn 2p 3/2 and Zn 2p 1/2 of Zn 2 species (Figure S5d).The binding energy at 451.8 and 444.2 eV, respectively, correspond to the spin orbit separation of In 3d 5/2 and In 3d 3/2 ingredients, indicating the formation of In 3 (Figure S5e).In addition, the S 2p peak centring at 161.0 eV for ZnIn 2 S 4 is assigned to S 2p 3/2 , which proves that sulfur is present as S 2-(Figure S5f).However, the binding energies of elements for ZnIn nanocomposite.The mesopores may be derived from the gap of growing ZnIn 2 S 4 nanosheets, which may be beneficial to the light propagation and the gas adsorption.Indeed, the ZnIn 2 S 4 / BiVO 4 composite possess a maximum CO 2 adsorption volume of 3.31 cm 3 g -1 at 0 C, almost 15 times that of the decahedral BiVO 4 (Figure S7b), indicating the staggered ZnIn 2 S 4 nanosheet is of a restrictive effect on CO 2 gas absorption. 3.2.Photocatalytic Performance.Photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 into fuel using solar energy is an effective strategy to solve the problem of global warming and energy shortage.The photocatalytic experiment was performed with the participation of deionized water under simulated solar irradiation.The major product of all photocatalysts is detected to be CO with a small amount of CH 4 (Figure 3a,b).The photoexcited holes in the valence band oxidize H 2 O to create hydrogen ions via the formula of H 2 O 1/2O 2 2H 2e -.The electrons in the CB reduce CO 2 to CO and CH 4 by the formula of CO 2 2e - 2H CO H 2 O and CO 2 8e - 8H CH 4 2H 2 O. Bare BiVO 4 is inactive to reduce CO 2 under continuous light illumination because there is not enough negativity at the CB level, and the ZnIn 2 S 4 nanosheets was also detected to exhibit poor CO 2 conversion.However, combination of the ZnIn 2 S 4 with BiVO 4 dramatically enhances the photocatalytic CO 2 conversion performance for all ZnIn 2 S 4 /BiVO 4 -1, ZnIn 2 S 4 /BiVO 4 -2, and ZnIn 2 S 4 /BiVO 4 -3 under simulated solar irradiation (Figure 3c).The meaningfully advanced photocatalytic performance of the ZnIn 2 S 4 / BiVO 4 can be attributed to the unique heterostructure benefiting for promoting the separation and transfer of photoexcited charges.It is also apparent that the different loading content of ZnIn 2 S 4 photocatalyst on the decahedral BiVO 4 obviously affects the production of CO.The optional ZnIn 2 S 4 loading for ZnIn 2 S 4 /BiVO 4 -2 exhibits the highest CO generation rate of 4.75 mol h -1 g -1 , almost nine times that of the ZnIn 2 S 4 nanosheet alone (0.53 mol g -1 h -1 ).The amount of increase of ZnIn 2 S 4 on the BiVO 4 may improve the photoabsorption, which leads to producing more charge carriers to transfer BiVO 4 .However, the superfluous ZnIn 2 S 4 may reduce the number of the catalytic active sites of the BiVO 4 , reflecting negatively on the photocatalytic efficiency.The photocatalytic yield increases over the ZnIn 2 S 4 /BiVO 4 heterojunction over 5 h, indicating high stability in the photocatalytic reaction process.However, potential deposition of C species may occur on the surface of the material after a long reaction time, which may cover the active sites and lead to decreasing catalytic activities.Nevertheless, the catalytic activities may be recovered through post annealing treatment of the photocatalyst.The O 2 output was also close to the stoichiometric molar ratio of CO to O 2 .In the case of dark conditions or the absence of photocatalyst, no CO or CH 4 product was detected, which proves that the CO 2 conversion is driven by illumination under the action of the photocatalyst.A blank experiment was conducted under the same conditions without the participation of CO 2 , and no CO or CH 4 products were found, confirming that the carbon source was entirely derived from the imported CO 2 .In addition, the crystallo- graphic phase and morphology of the ZnIn 2 S 4 /BiVO 4 heterojunction did not change before and after simulated solar irradiation, which proves the good durability of this catalyst (Figure S8). 3.3.Reasons for Excellent Photocatalytic Performance.The prerogative of composite materials also allows photoexcited electrons and holes to be spatially separated on different semiconductors. 28The excess surviving electrons can facilitate the adsorption and activation of CO 2 on the surface of the photocatalytic material.The Kelvin probe force microscopy technique was hired to research separation and transfer situation of the photogenerated charge carriers on BiVO 4 before and after combination with the ZnIn 2 S 4 nanosheet.The SPV mapping images were obtained by subtracting the surface potential in the dark from the light conditions (Figure S9), and the more positive SPV signal change represents a higher density of holes.The SPV image of individual BiVO 4 only displays 30 mV positive change before and after illumination (Figure 4d).However, the ZnIn 2 S 4 / BiVO 4 exhibits a significant change of 300 mV (Figure 4c), indicating a large increment of hole concentration on BiVO 4 .Therefore, it can be inferred that the vectorial holes shift of ZnIn 2 S 4 BiVO 4 or electron transfer of BiVO 4 ZnIn 2 S 4 should happen when ZnIn 2 S 4 and BiVO 4 are simultaneously excited, as shown in Figure 3d. To study the electron and hole transfer mechanism between BiVO 4 and ZnIn 2 S 4 , referring to previous literature, there are two possible charge transfer pathways: conventional type II (staggered gap) (Figure 5b) and direct Z-scheme heterojunction mechanism (Figure 5a).According to the band gap width measured by the above ultraviolet absorption spectrum, the CB and VB energy levels of BiVO 4 are determined to be 0 eV and 2.40 eV (vs NHE), 37 and the CB and VB edge energy levels of ZnIn 2 S 4 are -0.98 eV and 1.67 eV (vs NHE). 38If the ZnIn 2 S 4 /BiVO 4 heterostructure is a traditional type II, the electrons in ZnIn 2 S 4 may directly shift to the CB of BiVO 4 because the E CB of ZnIn 2 S 4 is more negative than that of BiVO 4 .Meanwhile, the holes from the lower VB of BiVO 4 may be injected into the higher VB of ZnIn 2 S 4 (Figure 5b).However, in a photocatalytic CO 2 reduction system, the minimum reduction potentials necessary for CO 2 to CO and CH 4 are -0.51 and -0.24 eV (vs NHE), respectively. If the photoexcited electrons of ZnIn 2 S 4 shift to the CB of BiVO 4 , the amassed electrons of BiVO 4 could not convert CO 2 into CO or CH 4 because the CB of BiVO 4 is below the position required for the CO 2 reduction potential.It means that it is impossible for the ZnIn 2 S 4 /BiVO 4 heterostructure to follow the traditional type II.Therefore, the charge shift pathway of the ZnIn 2 S 4 /BiVO 4 composite should be known as a direct Z-scheme model.The photoexcited electrons from a comparatively low CB of the BiVO 4 may recombine with the existing holes of ZnIn 2 S 4 with a relatively high VB.Consequently, the chance of electron-hole recombination for the ZnIn 2 S 4 can be drastically reduced, and then more reductive photogenerated electrons would store in the CB of the ZnIn 2 S 4 , thus enhancing the photocatalytic CO 2 conversion activity. To further verify the Z-scheme mechanism, we performed ESR with 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO Furthermore, electrostatic potential distribution calculations were carried out to determine the energy barrier between BiVO 4 and ZnIn 2 S 4 .The main exposure facets of the BiVO 4 are (010) facet and (110) facet. 39In order to simplify the argument, we focus on the (010) facet only, and the case of BiVO 4 (110) facet can be treated similarly (Figure S11). and the Nernst equation: the E F (vs NHE, pH 7) of the BiVO 4 (010) facet and the ZnIn 2 S 4 (001) facet can thus be determined to be 0.527 and 0.157 eV, respectively.Obviously, the position of the Fermi level (E F ) of BiVO 4 is obviously much more positive than that of ZnIn 2 S 4 .Therefore, as shown in Figure 7e, when ZnIn 2 S 4 and BiVO 4 contact intimately, the electrons will transfer from ZnIn 2 S 4 to BiVO 4 spontaneously, resulting in ZnIn 2 S 4 being positively charged and BiVO 4 being negatively charged at the heterogeneous interfaces.Thus, energy band bending may happen, and an internal built-in electric field with the direction from ZnIn 2 S 4 to BiVO 4 may form at the heterogeneous interface.This built-in electric field may promote the photoexcited electrons in the CB of BiVO 4 to transfer across the interface and combine with the photoexcited holes in the VB of ZnIn 2 S 4 , indicating that this is an electron transfer process with Z-scheme band configuration. 41,42he liquid transient photoluminescence (PL) decay profiles of various samples were investigated to further probe the charge transfers between ZnIn 2 S 4 and BiVO 4 .As observed in Figure 8 the ZnIn 2 S 4 and holes of the BiVO 4 , leading to improve photocatalytic CO 2 conversion performance effectively. To ulteriorly explore the kinetics of the ZnIn 2 S 4 /BiVO 4 heterostrucutured photocatalyst, we performed the photoelectrochemical property measurements.Figure S12a"

Figure 7a, b shows the structures of the BiVO 4 (010) facet and ZnIn 2 S 4 (001) facet.As illustrated in Figure 7c, d, the obtained Fermi levels (vs vacuum level) of the BiVO 4 and the ZnIn 2 S 4were -5.44 and -5.07 eV, respectively.According to the following relational expression between E F (vs NHE) and E F (vs vacuum level)40 , the PL decay traces of ZnIn 2 S 4 /BiVO 4 -1, ZnIn 2 S 4 / BiVO 4 -2, and ZnIn 2 S 4 /BiVO 4 -3 display different PL lifetimes of 1.47, 2.21, and 1.77 ns, respectively, possibly because the coverage of BiVO 4 with different amounts of ZnIn 2 S 4 may affects light absorption and carrier transfer.However, the ZnIn 2 S 4 /BiVO 4 composite exhibit slower decay traces and a longer PL lifetime than both the individual BiVO 4 (0.97 ns) and ZnIn 2 S 4 (1.24ns).It signifies that the consumption of the holes of the ZnIn 2 S 4 by the electrons of the BiVO 4 inhibits the chance of recombination with the electrons of the ZnIn 2 S 4 , which thus prolongs the survival time of both the electrons of Figure 5.
