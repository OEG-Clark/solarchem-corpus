    "content": "Nanoporous photocatalysts have been designed to exhibit unique photocatalytic activities through framework substitution of titanium species or surface immobilization of rhenium complex onto mesoporous silica.This article summarizes recent work on the synthesis, characterization and photocatalytic activities of the designed porous photocatalysts performed by the present authors.Various spectroscopic investigations revealed that the photo-excited states of these catalysts play a vital role in the photocatalytic reactions and their photocatalytic reactivities are strongly dependent on structures of active sites, which are confined and immobilized in the restricted framework structure of the mesoporous silica.Highly dispersed titanium oxide species incorporated in the framework of mesoporous silica exhibited high and unique photocatalytic reactivity for the reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O to produce CH 4 and CH 3 OH under UV irradiation, its reactivity being much higher than bulk TiO 2 .The cationic rhenium(I) complex was encapsulated into a mesoporous AlMCM-41 material by ion-exchange method, yielding a visible light photocatalyst to be active for photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 ."

    "content": "Ti-MCM-41 (Si/Ti 14 100), Ti-MCM-48 (Si/Ti 14 80) and TS-1 (Si/Ti 14 85) were hydrothermally synthesized according to procedure reported previously 19.Ti-SBA-15 (Si/Ti 14 270) was synthesized according to the modified method described previously 20.Ti-SBA-15 with the p6mm structure is obtained from an aqueous acidic solution (0.33 M HCl) of the triblock copolymer (composition EO 20 PO 70 EO 20 ), titanium n-propoxide (TINPOT) and tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS).The mixture is stirred at 313 K and then heated to 373 K in a Polypropylene bottle.The molar composition is 1 P123:60 TEOS:1.5 TINPOT:x HCl:9000 H 2 O.To remove the copolymer and to activate the catalyst, the assynthesized sample is calcined in air to 773 K for 4 h.A TiO 2 powdered catalyst, JRC-TIO-4 (anatase 92, rutile 8), supplied by the Catalysis Society of Japan was used.The cationic rhenium complex, Re(CO) 3 (bpy)(py) (bpy 14 2,2 0 -bipyridine, py 14 pyridine) has been used as a photosensitizer.The complex was encapsulated into the mesoporous AlMCM-41 (Si/Al 14 30) molecular sieves by ion exchange method using the aqueous solution of Re(CO) 3 (bpy)(py) PF 6 . The encapsulated samples were evacuated (10 )4 Torr) at 373 K for 16 h 21,22. The photoluminescence spectra of the catalysts were measured at 298 and 77 K using a SPEX FLUOLOG-3 spectrophotofluorometer.The diffuse reflectance UV-VIS absorption (UV-DRS) spectra were measured at 298 K by a Shimadzu UV-2200A double-beam digital spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere, where a BaSO 4 was used as reference.The FT-IR spectra were recorded at 298 K with a JASCO FT-IR-7300 spectrometer using the sample wafer.The XAFS spectra (XANES and EXAFS) of the catalysts were measured at the Photon Factory at the National Laboratory for High-Energy Physics, Tsukuba. The encapsulated samples were characterized by FT-IR, Xe-NMR and UV-DRS spectroscopies.To study the photoreaction of CO 2 over these encapsulated rhenium complexes using in situ FT-IR, the pellet of Re(CO) 3 (bpy)(py) /AlMCM-41 was placed into a in situ quartz cell with CaF 2 windows for FT-IR measurement and evacuated to about 10 )4 torr at 200 C for 12 h.Then, CO 2 was adsorbed onto the evacuated pellet followed by photoirradiation (k 350 nm) from 300 W-high pressure xenon-arc lamp (Oriel Instruments).In situ FT-IR spectra were recorded with photoirradiation time.The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 over encapsulated rhenium complexes was done in a quartz tube connected to a vacuum line analyzing the product by mass spectroscopy. The photocatalytic reductions of CO 2 with H 2 O were carried out with Ti-incorporated mesoporous silicas (50 mg) in a quartz cell with a flat bottom (88 cm 3 ) connected to a conventional vacuum system (1 10 )4 Pa range).Prior to photoreactions and spectroscopic measurements, the catalysts were heated in O 2 at 723 K for 8 h and evacuated at 473 K for 2 h to 1 10 )4 Pa.UV irradiation of the catalysts in the presence of CO 2 (36 lmol) and H 2 O (180 lmol) was carried out using a 100 W high-pressure Hg lamp (k 250 nm) at 323 K.The reaction products were analyzed by gas chromatography.Detailed methods for photocatalytic measurement are described elsewhere 9. The visible light photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 over encapsulated rhenium complexes was done in quartz tube connected to a vacuum line with analyzing the product by time-resolved mass spectrometry (Hiden DSMS).The hydrated catalysts were used for the reaction because the catalysts after dehydration at 100 C did not show any activities in photocatalytic reduction.The catalysts were saturated in water vapor (28 torr) for a day and evacuated at room temperature for 30 min to 1 10 )4 Pa.Visible light irradiation of the catalysts in the presence of CO 2 (28.4 Torr) was carried out using a 300 W-high pressure xenon-arc lamp (k 350 nm) at room temperature."

    "content": "Recently, Anpo and co-workers 456789 have found that highly dispersed titanium oxides can be produced in the zeolite framework, leading to the development of environmentally friendly photocatalytic systems having high catalytic efficiency and selectivity.However, semicrystalline periodic mesoporous materials are also good candidates for potential host of photocatalytic systems 19,23,24 because their larger pore sizes (20-100 A ) can allow high dispersion of active sites in photocatalysis as well as sterically hindered molecules facile diffusion to their internal active sites.In the present work, Tiincorporated mesoporous materials have been employed as photocatalysts for the reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O. UV-VIS DRS, XAFS and in situ photoluminescence investigations indicated that the Ti oxide species in the Ti-mesoporous silicas are highly dispersed within the porous framework and exist in a tetrahedral coordination. Figure 1 shows the absorption spectra of the Ti-containing mesoporous materials (Ti-MCM-41 and Ti-MCM-48), TS-1 zeolite and bulk TiO 2 powder measured by the UV diffuse reflectance method.The Ti-containing porous materials exhibit absorption bands in the wavelength regions of 220-280 nm, shifting into shorter wavelength regions as compared to the bulk TiO 2 catalyst.Such a shift to the shorter wavelength in the absorption band of titanium oxides can be attributed to the presence of titanium oxide species having a mainly tetrahedral coordination 24,25. Figure 2 shows the XANES spectra of the titanium oxide catalysts.The XANES spectra of the titanium oxide catalysts at the Ti K-edge show several welldefined pre-edge peaks which are related to the local structures surrounding the Ti atom.These relative intensities of the pre-edge peaks provide useful information on the coordination number surrounding the Ti atom 242526.As shown in figure 2(a) and (b), the Timesoporous silicas exhibit an intense single pre-edge peak which is similar to that of TS-1, while the bulk TiO 2 powder exhibits three characteristic weak pre-edge peaks attributed to the transitions from the 1s core level of Ti to three different kinds of molecular orbitals (1t 1g , 2t 2g , and 3e g ) of anatase TiO 2 .Because tetrahedrally coordinated Ti such as Ti(OPr i ) 4 was found to exhibit an intense single pre-edge peak due to the lack of an inversion center in the regular tetrahedron structure, the observation of this intense single pre-edge peak indicates that the titanium oxide species included within the framework of mesoporous silicas have a tetrahedral coordination.Figure 2 also shows the FT-EXAFS spectra of the catalysts and all data are given without corrections for phase shifts.Ti-incorporated mesoporous silicas exhibit a strong peak at around 1.6 A which can be assigned to the neighboring oxygen atoms (a Ti-O bond).Ti-MCM-41 (Figure 2(A)) and Ti-MCM-48 (Figure 2(B)) exhibit only Ti-O peaks indicating the presence of the isolated titanium oxide species on these catalysts.From the results obtained by the curve-fitting analysis of the EXAFS spectra, as shown in Figure 2, it was found that the Ti-incorporated mesoporous silicas consist of tetrahedral titanium ions with an atomic distance of 1.86 A for Ti-MCM-41 and 1.88 A for Ti-MCM-48.These atomic distances are much shorter than that of the bulk TiO 2 , 1.96 A 26. Ti-containing mesoporous materials exhibited a photoluminescence spectrum at around 450-600 nm by an excitation at around 260-290 nm at 77 K. Figure 3 shows the typical photoluminescence observed on Ti-MCM-48 by the excitation with UV light.The observed photoluminescence and absorption bands are in good agreement with those previously observed with the highly dispersed tetrahedrally coordinated titanium oxides prepared in silica matrices, where the absorption of UV light at around 280 nm brings about an electron transfer from the lattice oxygen to the titanium ion (Ti 4 ) to form a charge-transfer excited state 26,27.Photoluminescence spectra of Figures 3 and4 We can therefore conclude that the observed photoluminescence spectrum is attributed to the radiative decay process from the charge transfer excited state formed in this way to the ground state of the highly dispersed titanium oxide species having a tetrahedral coordination as shown in the following scheme: The lifetimes of the charge transfer excited state of the Ti-containing mesoporous materials were determined to be much longer (micro-second order) than that of the TiO 2 powder (nano-second order).Such a long lifetime of the charge transfer excited state is well associated with the presence of highly dispersed tetrahedral titanium oxide species.These results clearly indicate that the Ti-containing mesoporous materials consist of the highly dispersed isolated tetrahedral titanium oxide species in their framework, being in good agreement with results obtained by XAFS investigations. UV irradiation of powdered TiO 2 and Ti-containing porous materials in the presence of a mixture of CO 2 and H 2 O led to the evolution of CH 4 and CH 3 OH in the gas phase at 328 K, as well as trace amounts of CO, C 2 H 4 and C 2 H 6 .The evolution of small amounts of O 2 was also observed.UV-irradiation of the Ti-containing catalysts in the presence of CO 2 and H 2 O also led to the formation of CH 3 OH and CH 4 as the main products.The specific photocatalytic reactivities for the formation of CH 4 and CH 3 OH are shown in figure 5.It is clear that the photocatalytic reaction rate and selectivity for the formation of CH 3 OH strongly depend on the type of catalyst.It can be seen that the specific photocatalytic reactivities of the Ti-containing porous materials which have been normalized by a unit gram of TiO 2 in the catalysts are much higher than bulk TiO 2 .Among Ticontaining porous materials, Ti-MCM-48 exhibits much higher reactivity than either TS-1 or Ti-MCM-41.Besides the higher dispersion state of the titanium oxide species, other distinguishing features of these photocatalysts are: TS-1 has a smaller pore size (ca.5.7 A ) and a three-dimensional channel structure; Ti-MCM-41 has a large pore size (27 A ) but a one-dimensional channel structure; and Ti-MCM-48 has both large pore size (29 A ) and three-dimensional channels.The higher reactivity and higher selectivity for the formation of CH 3 OH observed with the Ti-MCM-48 than with other catalysts used here may be a combined contribution of the high dispersion state of the titanium oxide species and large pore size having a three-dimensional channel structure.In addition to Ti-MCM-41 and Ti-MCM-48, we propose here another Ti-mesoporous silica, Ti-SBA-15 that has a larger pore size than these materials.Ti-MCM-41 and Ti-MCM-48 are generally synthesized in basic conditions, while Ti-SBA-15 is synthesized in a strongly acidic solution.Ti-SBA-15, synthesized with a block copolymer template under acidic conditions, has a high surface area of 1040 m 2 /g and an average pore diameter of 69 A , compared to 27-29 A for Ti-MCM-41 and Ti-MCM-48.The curve-fitting analysis of the EXAFS with XANES spectra of Ti-SBA-15 reveals that this catalyst consists of titanium oxide species with a coordination number of 4.4 and an atomic distance of 1.85 A (data not shown).Consistent with the results on Ti-MCM-48, Ti-SBA-15 exhibits photoluminescence at around 450-650 nm upon excitation with UV light at around 225 nm and the addition of CO 2 or H 2 O to the excited Ti-SBA-15 results in a significant quenching of these photoluminescence spectra, suggesting the excellent accessibility of CO 2 and H 2 O to the titanium oxide species. Figure 6 displays the absorption spectra of Ti-SBA-15, Ti-MCM-41 and bulk TiO 2 powder measured by the UV diffuse reflectance method.The absorption band edge of Ti-SBA-15 shifts to the shorter wavelength of 232 nm (E g 14 5.4 eV) compared with that of Ti-MCM-41.This catalyst has a very intense and narrow UV absorption centered at around 205 nm, clearly indicating that titanium oxide species exist entirely in pure tetrahedral coordination 28,29.In fact, the bands at k 240 nm arise from a charge transfer of oxygen ligands to a central Ti(IV) ion with tetrahedral coordination 282930.It is known that a strong band at 205 nm and a small tail around 230 nm are assigned to two different framework sites of Ti(OH)(OSi) 3 and Ti(OSi) 4 , respectively 30, meaning that they have different tetrahedral environments and exist as mixtures of titanium siloxy-hydroxy species.It is likely that all of the titanium centers in Ti(OH)(OSi) 3 coordinated by three siloxy groups would be disclosed into the surface of mesoporous Ti-SBA-15.However, the titanium centers in Ti(OSi) 4 accommodate the four siloxy groups which might be partly disclosed into the surface. The specific photocatalytic reactivities for the formation of CH 4 and CH 3 OH are illustrated in figure 7. To our surprise, UV irradiation of Ti-SBA-15 in the presence of a mixture of CO 2 and H 2 O shows very high photocatalytic activity and, moreover, its activity is at least 20 times higher than Ti-MCM-48 and Ti-MCM-41.Preliminary photocatalytic results on the influence of acidity in the synthesis of Ti-SBA-15 indicate that the acid strength in the synthesis controls the dispersion of titanium species incorporated in the pore walls of SBA-15.The solubility of titania rises at very low pH less than 0 31 so that aging in strong acidic solution can lead to the formation of very highly dispersed tetrahedral titanium species in the precursor gel.It is clear that these highly dispersed titanium oxide species can significantly modify the separation of the photoformed electrons and holes, which results in an enhancement of the photocatalytic reactivity. In summary, the above results indicate that mesoporous molecular sieves with highly dispersed Ti oxide species in their frameworks can be promising candidates to serve as effective photocatalysts for the photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O 19,23,24. Based on host-guest interaction, molecular sieves have been used as heterogeneous host for the encapsulation of guest molecules such as organic molecules, metal complexes and organometallic fragments 13,21,22,323334.Such inorganic solid-state supramolecular systems generate the microheterogenization of the encap- sulated molecular assemblies which show the photocatalytic activity.For zeolite-entrapped complexes, the steric and electrostatic constraint imposed on the complexes within the channels or cages of zeolites can alter the photochemical and photophysical properties of the guest complexes and diminish the photodegradation and undesirable electron transfer reactions.Rhenium complexes such as ReX(CO) 3 (bpy) (X 14 Cl, Br and bpy 14 2,2-bipyridine) and Re(CO) 2 (bpy) P(OEt) 3 2 have been used as photocatalysts for CO 2 reduction to CO in a solvent mixture of triethanolamine(TEOA) and dimethylformamide(DMF) 15,16 so that their potential utility for photochemical activation of CO 2 has been steadily paid to attention to a purpose of construction of artificial photosynthetic systems 151617.Most studies on photochemical reduction of CO 2 using Re(I) complexes have focused on the homogeneous solution systems.There are only few reports concerning the encapsulation of rhenium complexes into molecular sieves and their photochemical application to the photochemical reduction of CO 2 21,22,32.In the present case, the cationic complex, Re(I)(CO) 3 (bpy)(py) (py 14 pyridine) was encapsulated into the mesopore of Al-MCM-41 and its photophysical properties were characterized by several spectroscopic tools. The cationic Re(CO) 3 (bpy)(py) complex was encapsulated into the mesoporous Al-MCM-41 (Si/ Al 14 30) molecular sieve by an ion-exchange method 21 using an aqueous solution of Re(CO) 3 (bpy) (py)PF 6 , which was used as a photosensitizer.The encapsulated rhenium complex, Re(CO) 3 (bpy)(py) / AlMCM-41, was evacuated (10 )7 bar) at 100 C for 16 h and then was utilized for spectroscopic characterization.Scheme 1 shows a schematic feature of the encapsulation of Re(CO) 3 (bpy)(py) into the mesoporous host. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of Al-MCM-41 and Re(CO) 3 (bpy)(py) /Al-MCM-41 indicated that there is no significant change of Al-MCM-41 structure and the Al-MCM-41 framework is stable enough to act as a heterogeneous host for the encapsulation of the complex.The Xe-NMR spectrum of Re(CO) 3 (bpy) (py) /Al-MCM-41 after the encapsulation exhibited different chemical shift from that of Al-MCM-41 and the change of the chemical shift was responsible for the presence of the rhenium complex inside the mesopore of Al-MCM-41 35, as presented in Figure 8.The FT-IR spectrum of Re(CO) 3 (bpy)(py) /Al-MCM-41 showed that the frequencies of three CO ligands of Re(CO) 3 (bpy)(py) are changed after encapsulation into Al-MCM-41.This frequency change due to the encapsulation was ascribed to the steric hindrance and electronic interaction exerted to Re(CO) 3 (bpy)(py) restricted inside the Al-MCM-41 mesopore. In UV-DRS spectra of Re(I)(CO) 3 (bpy)(py) /Al-MCM-41, the new absorption bands appeared at 380-530 nm upon photoirradiation (Figure 9), which is assigned to the Re(I)(CO) 3 (bpy ) )(py) radical 36,37.The spectrum in figure 9 donor 36.In Re(I)(CO) 3 (bpy)(py) /AlMCM-41, the Re(I)(CO) 3 (bpy ) )(py) radical was produced with photoirradiation in the absence of an electron donor such as TEOA.The framework of the aluminosilicate zeolites is able to show the electron-donating property to proper electron acceptors encapsulated in their pores and the steric hindrance stabilizes the generated radical species restricted in the pores 39.From the results of EPR, UV-VIS, and FT-IR spectra, it is likely that the aluminosilicate framework of Al-MCM-41 would act as an electron donor in the photoinduced formation of Re(I)(CO) 3 (bpy ) )(py) radical in Al-MCM-41.Figure 11 displays photoluminescence (PL) spectra of Re(CO) 3 (bpy)(py) / Al-MCM-41 according to several treatments.Re(CO) 3 (bpy)(py) /Al-MCM-41 dehy-drated in vacuo at 373 K showed photoluminescence (PL) at 77 K due to MLCT (metal-to-ligand charge transfer) band at 380-530 nm.With CO 2 adsorption and photoirradiation, the PL intensity decreased greatly, indicating that CO 2 interacts with the MLCT band of Re(CO) 3 (bpy ) )(py) complex 27.The result suggests that Re(CO) 3 (bpy)(py) in Al-MCM-41 is reduced into the radical of Re(CO) 3 (bpy ) )(py) by photoirradiation in the presence of CO 2 which may act as an active species in photoinduced activation and reduction of CO 2 . With photoirradiation onto CO 2 -adsorbed Re (CO) 3 (bpy)(py) /AlMCM-41, the formation of carbonates and CO was confirmed by FT-IR and product analysis by a mass spectrometer (MS).As shown in figure 10, the intensity of the CO 2 band at 2343 cm )1 decreased while the intensity of the carbonate band at 1400-1700 cm )1 increased.However, it is not clear types of carbonates are formed during the photoirradiation.It is also confirmed from the MS analysis that CO was also produced with decreasing the concentration of CO 2 as a reactant although the MS analysis data were not quantitative (Figure 12).This result indicates that hydrated Re(CO) 3 (bpy)(py) /AlMCM-41 shows photocatalytic activity of in the reduction of CO 2 into CO together with the formation of surface carbonates as for Re(CO) 3 (bpy)(py) /NaY 22.In contrast, the dehydrated catalyst did not show any significant activity in the reaction.It is further confirmed by the result that the concentration of water in the closed reactor decreased upon photoirradiation in the presence of CO 2 , demonstrating that water molecules adsorbed on the catalyst surface assist the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 ."

    "content": "In the present account, a summary of the recent results on the synthesis, characterization and photocatalytic activities of the designed mesoporous photocatalysts has been presented.Ti-incorporated mesoporous silicas exhibited high and unique photocatalytic reactivity for the reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O to produce CH 4 and CH 3 OH under UV irradiation.The titanium oxide species incorporated in pore walls of the mesoporous materials have been found to exist as isolated tetrahedral species.The cationic rhenium(I) complex was encapsulated into a mesoporous AlMCM-41 material by ion-exchange method.The encapsulated rhenium complexes of Re(CO) 3 (bpy)(py) /AlMCM-41 showed the activity for photoinduced activation and reduction of CO 2 in CO and carbonate species.It is assumed that the aluminosilicate framework of mesoprosus AlMCM-41 molecular sieves act as an electron donor to form Re(CO) 3 (bpy ) )(py) radical which is active species for the activation and reduction of CO 2 into CO and carbonate species.

Figure 12.The formation of carbon monoxide (a) and a decrease in water concentration (b) in the vapor phase of the reactor during photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 over hydrated Re(CO) 3 (bpy)(py) / AlMCM-41 13. indicate that the addition of H 2 O or CO 2 molecules onto the Ti-MCM-48 leads to the efficient quenching of the photoluminescence with different efficiencies.The lifetime of the charge transfer excited state was also found to be shortened by the addition of CO 2 or H 2 O, its extent depending on the amount of added gasses.Such an efficient quenching of the photoluminescence with CO 2 or H 2 O suggests not only that tetrahedrally coordinated titanium oxide species locate at positions accessible to the added CO 2 or H 2 O but also that added CO 2 or H 2 O interacts with the titanium oxide species in both its ground and excited states.The addition of CO 2 was less effective for the quenching of the photoluminescence in their intensities and lifetimes than those observed by the addition of H 2 O, indicating that the interaction of CO 2 with the titanium oxide species is weaker than that of H 2 O.
