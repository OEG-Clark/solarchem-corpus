    "content": "Nickel-based TiO 2 photocatalysts were immobilized onto carriers (quartz plates and monoliths) in a unique reactor configuration to provide a high ratio of illuminated surface area of catalyst for the reduction in CO 2 to fuels under UV and visible light.The incorporation of Ni 2 in the TiO 2 matrix inhibits the grain growth of anatase crystallites and suppresses phase transformation.The Ni 2 atom is also found to be replacing some of the Ti atoms in the crystal lattice of TiO 2 during the sol-gel method, thus causing a change in optical absorption.Using water as a reductant, vapour-phase CO 2 was reduced to fuels with the monolith threaded with optical fibres and quartz plate photoreactor system following 4 h of light irradiation.More importantly, the improved conversion efficiency is ascribed to the presence of Ni 2 species which served as electrons traps that suppressed recombination, resulting in effective charge separation and CO 2 reduction."

    "content": "In this study, honeycomb ceramic monoliths and optical fibres were used as supports.The 177 channels per 2 A 2 mm aperture honeycomb monoliths with dimensions of 4 cm (diameter) by 5 cm (length) were supplied by Chauger Honeycomb Ceramics Company, Taiwan.The cleaned monoliths were first pre-coated with silica (SiO 2 ) sol to ensure catalyst deposition on the SiO 2 layer instead of being embedded in the macropores of the monolithic structure.The detailed dip-coating procedure for preparing the SiO 2 sol is described elsewhere 12.The SiO 2 -coated monoliths were then submerged in sol-gel-derived Ni 2 -TiO 2 sol (Fig. 1) with different loading ratios (0.5-2.0 wt) using a brushless motor speed control system at the rate of 9 cm/min.For the synthesis of the metal-loaded sol shown in Fig. 1, the calculated amount of metal precursor e.g.nickel (II) nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO 3 ) 2 A6H 2- O) was dissolved in 14 ml of acetic acid and stirred for 12 h.A mixture of titanium (IV) butoxide and n-butanol with a volume ratio of 1:4 was added to the solution containing the pre-dissolved metal precursor.The resulting solution was stirred at 100 rpm for 16 h.Subsequently, the PEG solution was added to the metal-loaded sol and stirred for 6 h to prevent cracking of the coated layers during drying and enhance viscosity.Pure TiO 2 sol was prepared without the addition of the metal precursors.The pre-coated SiO 2 monoliths were then submerged in the metal sol for 30 min.After blowing the excess slurry out with an air jet gun, the monoliths were dried and calcined in a furnace at 150 C and 500 C, respectively.Metal-based TiO 2 nanoparticles were also prepared by first drying the sol at 80 C and then further drying and calcination in a furnace at the same temperatures used for the monoliths. Scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS, Quanta 600 model) were used for evaluating the elemental composition and morphology of the catalysts by measuring the emitted X-rays after scanning a section of the compacted pellets by an electron beam (15 eV).Analysis of the crystallographic structure of the catalyst was conducted by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Hiltonbrooks), while ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis, Cary 300) was used for the measurement of the band gap and the absorbance of ultraviolet light as a function of the transmittance.The band gap energy (E g ) of the catalysts can be estimated using the standard equation, which is based on the relationship between frequency (c/k) and photon energy (E g 1240/k).The surface area was determined by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis, while the chemical and electronic states of the elements present in the catalysts were detected by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Kratos Axis Ultra).All binding energies were charge corrected to the internal standard of carbon (1s, 285 eV).The pore size distribution and porosity changes in the monoliths were observed using a mercury (Hg) porosimetry analyser (Micromeritics Autopore IV 9500 V1.05) with Hg pressure in the range of 0.1-40,000 psia. Photocatalytic reaction was conducted in a cylindrical Pyrex glass reactor with dimensions of 5.5 cm A 11 cm (diameter and height).The catalyst-coated supports internally illuminated monoliths threaded with optical fibres or quartz plate was placed into the multi-functional gas phase photoreactor separately.For the internally illuminated monolith reactor, the monolith threaded with approximately 177 optical fibres was placed in a parallel manner, so light irradiated through the quartz window of the reactor could be transmitted along the internal channels of the monolith.Approximately, 0.2 g of catalyst was evenly dispersed on the quartz plate with dimensions of 4.5 cm A 10.5 cm for the quartz plate reactor setup, as illustrated in Fig. 2. The surface of the quartz plate was roughened by sandblasting to provide strong adherence between the catalyst and the support.The coated quartz plate was then inclined at an angle of 15facing the light rays emitted through the quartz window.The light source used in both setups were the halogen lamp (500 W) and 200 W mercury lamp (Omnicure S2000) with influxes of visible and UV light measured to be 68.35 and 33.42 mW/cm 2 , respectively.The light wavelength was adjusted for UVA light irradiation using 365 nm filter, while the halogen lamp had its wavelength distribution within the range of 400-1100 nm with its highest intensity at 500 nm.Light intensities at different positions of the assembled photoreactor were also measured in order to establish the interaction of light with the catalyst supports.The radiometer was rotated 60every 15 min to get an average of 6 readings.When UVA irradiance of 3.4 W/cm 2 was used, average light intensities of 1.02 mW/cm 2 and 4.53 mW/cm 2 were obtained with the monolith threaded with optical fibres or quartz plate as supports, respectively.These results show that the light intensity per catalyst area is higher when the quartz plate is used as a support.The transmission of light in the gas phase reactor when the quartz plate is used as a support differs from the monoliths threaded with optical fibres.For the quartz plate configuration, light falls directly on the surface of the quartz plate, where a portion of the transmitted light rays illuminates and activates the catalyst surface, while the remaining is reflected.For the monolith configuration, emitted light from the light guide travels to the reactor by means of the optical fibres and illuminates the catalyst coating present on the internal channels of the monolith.The reactor was then purged with helium (He) gas to check for leakage and contamination.This was switched to continuous CO 2 gas flow saturated with water vapour at flow rate of 4 ml/min if no leak was detected.The H 2 O content in the feed was 50 ml.The retention time and pressure were retained at 3240 s and 1 bar for every experimental run, respectively.The photoreactor wrapped in aluminium foil was placed in the gloved box to avoid external light interference.After 1 h, the light source was turned on, and the extracted gas samples taken after 4 h were identified and analysed using the mass spectrometer (MS, Hiden Analytical) equipped with capillary, quadrupole mass analyser (HAL 201-RC) and Faraday/Secondary electron multiplier (SEM) detectors.Each gas compound was determined by using a file created by Hiden Analytical with the QGA Professional Software.A unique mass and ionization profile was primarily assigned to each compound after the spectral overlaps were resolved by the software.Table S1 shows the mass distribution key used for identification of individual compounds where the grey-coloured boxes represent the peaks suitable for analysis after the spectral overlap was resolved by the software, while the blue-coloured boxes represent the peaks where the spectral overlap could not be resolved.The grey-coloured boxes were therefore chosen for identifying individual gas compounds, and the respective masses under which they were present were the specific masses chosen for compound identification.The software automatically calculated and subtracted the spectral overlap before providing quantitative analysis.The resulting data from calibration were used by the QGA for subsequent experimental runs.The results were displayed as they were acquired in tabular format as ppm.An average of 3 readings was used.Blank reactions were performed with and without the light source and CO 2 in the presence and absence of the catalyst to confirm that reactions were due to CO 2 photoreduction.The presence of hydrocarbons was not identified in the aforementioned conditions."

    "content": "The XRD diffraction patterns of the Ni 2 -TiO 2 samples are presented in Fig. 3. Anatase was the only crystalline phase observed after calcination at 773 K for the Ni 2 -TiO 2 samples.No XRD peaks attributed to the rutile phase were detected in these samples as opposed to the diffraction pattern of pure TiO 2 , where additional peaks of rutile were detected at peak positions of 27.4and 36.1.Nickel peaks in its metal or oxide phase were not observed for all sol-gel-derived catalysts, either due to the nature and high dispersion of a large amount of smaller Ni 2 crystallites in TiO 2 structure or their small crystallite size could not be detected by XRD.The crystallite size of all Ni 2 -TiO 2 -based samples calculated from the Scherrer equation was within the range of 8.96-12.79nm.The crystallite size obtained at 0.5 wt was 12.79 nm compared to 8.96 nm at 2 wt doping ratio.The relative intensity of the peaks of Ni 2 -TiO 2 samples weakens and broadens compared to pure TiO 2 .An increase in Ni 2 concentration resulted in peak broadening of the main anatase peaks (1 0 1 and 2 0 1) of the nanoparticles, which are ascribed to the decrease in crystallite size (Fig. 3). The decreasing crystallite size with increasing metal concentration occurs as a result of the grain growth being inhibited.These results are also consistent with previous findings, as the rutile peak was also detected for pure TiO 2 but not with increased Ni 2 concentration on calcination at 773 K 3,15,16.Shifu et al. 3 further explained that the inhibition of the crystal grain growth results in the decrease in the crystallite size which causes an increase in specific surface area.Table 1 shows the lattice constants (a and c) for the Ni 2 -TiO 2 samples calculated based on the anatase (1 0 1) diffraction peaks of the samples.Comparison of the value of the lattice constant 'a' of TiO 2 with the doped samples shows that the addition of Ni 2 has little effect, with the values remaining almost constant.However, the 'c' values show a slight increase upon Ni 2 doping, which is in agreement with the literature 17.Thus, this suggests that Ni 2 ions might be incorporated into the crystal lattice of TiO 2 substitutionally due to the comparable ionic radius of Ni 2 (0.69 A) and Ti 4 (0.68 A) 18. The BET-specific surface area of the Ni 2 -TiO 2 -based photocatalysts was within the range of 72.35-105.00m 2 /g (Table 1).An increase in specific surface area of TiO 2 (52.50 m 2 /g) occurs with an increase in Ni 2 concentration.The BET-specific surface area values are consistent with XRD, where an increase in Ni 2 concentration suppresses the grain growth of anatase due to its insertion in the TiO 2 lattice.This increased surface area is probably due to the strong interaction between Ni 2 and Ti 4 , which causes lattice expansion and decreased grain growth.Aggregates of nanosized spherical particles of homogeneous shapes and varying sizes from 5-14 nm were observed from the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) micrographs using different magnifications (Fig. 4).Spot analysis on the SEM-EDS micrographs confirmed that Ni 2 was dispersed on the surface of TiO 2 with its morphological features not changed by doping.The high-resolution (HR) TEM images of 0.5 wtNi 2 -TiO 2 illustrated in Fig. 4b indicate that the particles were highly crystallized compared to Fig. 4a, where an amorphous crystal structure is clearly evident in the 2 wtNi 2 -TiO 2 sample.The HR-TEM results are in agreement with the XRD results, which indicate that the doping ratio influences the level of crystallinity and grain growth of anatase nuclei.Fig. 4c shows the cross-sectional view and SEM-EDS micrograph of the 2 wtNi 2 -TiO 2 monolith.Film thickness of 7.376 lm was obtained after dip coating the pre-coated SiO 2 monolith with TiO 2 sol.The chemical composition of the 2 wtNi 2 -TiO 2 monolith is also illustrated in Fig. 4c.To further investigate the effect of coating SiO 2 and Ni-TiO 2 on the bare monolith, pore size distribution and changes in porosity before and after SiO 2 and TiO 2 coatings were characterized by mercury porosimetry (MP), as presented in Figs.S1a-c.The bare monolith illustrated in Fig. S1a which presented a macropore distribution with the maximum centred at 3.84 lm is in agreement with the literature 19.Pore sizes below 0.07 lm were not observed, but are found in the other samples. After the monolith was coated with SiO 2 sol twice, the porosity of the monolith decreased from 59.37 to 44.27.The intrusion volume also decreased for this pore range due to more accessible macropores being filled with SiO 2 crystals.Different pore size distributions within the range of 0.01-0.09lm were now observed due to the space between the SiO 2 crystals formed on the monolith (Fig. S1b).Smaller pore distribution was also observed after 1 coat of Ni 2 -TiO 2 sol was applied on the pre-coated SiO 2 monolith.The intrusion volume and porosity further decreased to 0.16 mL/g.and 34.52 due to smaller interparticle spaces created after Ni 2 -TiO 2 sol was coated on the monolith (Fig. S1c). The chemical composition and oxidation states of the samples were determined before and after photocatalytic reaction.The high-resolution XPS spectra of Ni 2p, Ti 2p, and C 1s on the Ni-TiO 2 samples are presented in Figs.S2a-d.As shown in Fig. S2a, the two broad peaks observed for all the samples can be indexed to the Ni 2p spin orbit splitting into 2p 3/2 and 2p 1/2 .The peaks at 856 and 874 eV are Ni 2p 3/2 and 2p 1/2 , with the broad peaks at 861 and 880 eV the corresponding satellites.All peak positions correspond to the oxide present in Ni, which is assigned to NiO species 20.No obvious difference can be observed from the Ni 2p peaks of the sample before and after the photocatalytic reactions (Fig. S2a). As shown in Fig. S2b, the two peaks observed at 458.1 0.6 eV for Ti 2p 3/2 and 464.4 0.5 eV for Ti 2p 1/2 correspond to Ti 4 in TiO 2 20,21.These values are consistent with the values of Ti 4 in pure TiO 2 reported in the literature 22.The C1s peaks were fitted into 3 main components to represent CACAC bonds at 284.9 0.1 eV, CAO bonds at 286.2 0.1 eV and OACO at 288.2 0.1 eV (Fig. S2c).The O 1s peaks in Figs.S2d can be assigned into three types of chemical states.The binding energies at 530.0 0.07 eV can be assigned to the bulk oxygen bound on TiO 2 .This value is consistent with the value of 530 eV reported in the literature for anatase TiO 2 20,23.The peak at 531.0 eV probably corresponds to the O 1s peak of NiO.The binding energy of the O 1s peak of the pumice supported nickel catalysts prepared by Venezia et al. 24 was at 531.0 0.07 eV and corresponds to NiO.The other peak at 532.0 0.02 eV can be attributed to the surface oxygen by hydroxyl species on the sample surface 25,26.Shifu et al. 3,27 reported that electron hole recombination could be suppressed due to the interaction of the photogenerated electron hole pair with readily available chemisorbed oxygen on the surface of TiO 2 . The absorption spectra for the Ni-based photocatalysts synthesized by the sol-gel method at various metal concentrations are presented in Fig. 5. Comparison of the absorption spectra of the 0.5 wtNi-TiO 2 samples showed slight shift compared to the spectra of pure TiO 2 .This could be due to the low Ni concentration used during sample synthesis.The resulting Ni 2 -based TiO 2 photocatalysts showed increased absorption in the visible light with increased metal concentration.The band gap energies of the Ni 2 -based catalysts were within the range of 2.87-3.02eV, with the largest red shift occurring for the 2 wt sample.These results are consistent with the findings of Li et al. 28 and Wang et al. 29, where increasing metal concentration results in a shift of the absorption edges of the TiO 2 based samples.The formation of defect centres generated from the substitution of Ti 4 by Ni 2 ions through its incorporation into the TiO 2 crystal structure has been reported to cause this change in optical absorption 16.Ganesh et al. 30 reported that the increased absorption and sharpness of the spectra of the Ni 2 -TiO 2 samples with increased doping ratio were due to the charge transfer from the valence band created by the 2p orbitals of the oxide cations to the conduction band created by the 3d orbitals of the Ti 4 cations.Sim et al. 23 observed a similar trend and attributed the shift to the overlap of the 3d level of conduction band in Ti 4 with the d level of Ni 2 resulting in the charge transfer transition between the electrons in the d level of Ni 2 and the conduction band of TiO 2 . The Ni 2 -based TiO 2 catalysts coated on the monolith threaded with optical fibres, and the quartz plates were used to reduce vapour-phase CO 2 for 4 h using UVA or visible light irradiation.Fig. 6(I-II) show that various products were formed including significant amounts of hydrogen, methanol, acetaldehyde and ethanol.Trace amounts of methane, ethylene and oxygen were also observed.The photoreduction studies showed that the modification of TiO 2 with Ni 2 can increase the product rates of these hydrocarbons compared to pure TiO 2 .The CO 2 reduction experiments were repeated thrice, and the average yields and error bars are illustrated in Fig. 6.As shown in Fig. 6(I), the product rates of hydrogen, methanol, ethanol and acetaldehyde steadily increase with an increase in doping ratio to give an optimal ratio of 1.5 wtNi 2 -TiO 2 after which reduced product rates were observed for the subsequent higher doping ratios under UVA light.The rate of hydrogen and methanol is observed to evolve rapidly, with maximum product rate of 18.13 lmol/g cat h and 5.58 lmol/g cat h, respectively, for the catalysts coated on the monolith threaded with optical fibres and 61.69 lmol/g cat h and 19.51 lmol/g cat h, respectively, for the catalysts coated on the quartz plates.Hydrocarbon evolution is higher under UVA light irradiation when the quartz plate is used as a catalyst carrier compared to the monolith threaded with optical fibres.Fig. 6(II) presents the CO 2 photoreduction results under visible light irradiation for Ni 2 -based catalysts coated on catalyst carriers.The product rate steadily increases with an increase in metal concentration to give maximum product rates at an optimal ratio of 1.5 wtNi 2 -TiO 2 for the internally illuminated monolith photoreactor system.Following 4 h of visible light irradiation, vapour-phase CO 2 was reduced to hydrogen, methanol, ethanol and acetaldehyde by the quartz plate photoreactor system using water as a reductant to obtain an optimal ratio of 1 wtNi 2 -TiO 2 (Fig. 6(II)).Fig. 6(III) shows the effect of reaction time on the product rate using the optimal catalyst, 1 wtNi 2 -TiO 2 catalyst dispersed on the quartz plate under visible light irradiation.The rate of methanol production steadily increases till the 4th hour, after which decline in product formation was observed for the subsequent hours. Overall, the Ni 2 -based photocatalysts demonstrated improved photoreduction activity in UV and visible light region compared to pure TiO 2 .These results can be attributed to the incorporation of Ni 2 in the substitutional sites of TiO 2 after calcination, strong metal-support interactions and accessible active metal sites arising from the appropriate metal dispersion and loading amount.The decrease in crystallite size with increased Ni 2 concentration and lattice expansion observed in the XRD patterns of these samples explains the peak broadening observed which is associated with substitutional doping.The expansion of the lattice of the metalloaded TiO 2 samples also indicates the likelihood of Ni 2 ions substituting Ti 4 due to the similarity of the ionic radii of the dopants to the host ion, Ti 4 . The XRD results are also consistent with BET results obtained for the Ni 2 -based samples, where higher surface area values were observed with decreased grain growth of anatase.Colon et al. 32, Zhang et al. 33 and Yang et al. 34 observed this same phenomenon and attributed to the high surface values to the lattice expansion caused by substitutional doping retarding grain growth and thus forming smaller crystallites.Colon et al. 32 further explained that the thermal decomposition of nitrate from the Cu precursor could be responsible for the increase in surface porosity during calcination.Regalbuto 35 also reported that calcination increases microporosity and specific surface area as many organic residues which cause pore blockage are thermally decomposed.The influence of these substitutional ions is further confirmed by the change in light absorption properties and electronic structure of the metalloaded TiO 2 samples observed in the UV-Vis spectra when compared to pure TiO 2 .Sahu and Biswas 16 reported that metal ions located in the bulk of TiO 2 cause lattice deformation owing to the rearrangement of the neighbouring atoms compensating for charge deficiency.This charge compensation effect introduces oxygen vacancies due to the presence of metal ions in TiO 2 lattice sites.They further explained that the shift in the band gap occurred due to lattice deformation affecting the electronic structure.Electronic states introduced by substitutional metal ions on the bottom of the conduction band edge of TiO 2 cause the formation of a new higher unoccupied molecular orbital 31.This molecular orbital narrows the band gap, as also found in this study and thus affecting photon absorption.Li et al. 31 reported that oxygen vacancies have the capacity of increasing the lifetime of holes due to their strong trapping effect of photo-excited electrons.The improved photoreduction activity of the metal-loaded TiO 2 -based samples observed in this study was therefore due to efficient electron hole separation induced by the trapping effect of substitutional metal ions in the lattice of TiO 2 via the p-n junction formation between NiO and TiO 2 .Table 2 shows the production rates of CO 2 photoreduction obtained using NiO-TiO 2 in this study and the literature.The results of this experimental work can be compared with research conducted by Rajalakshmi 36 where NiO-and CuO-doped TiO 2 were used for CO 2 photoreduction.The metal precursor was added by sol-gel and impregnation, respectively, with H 2 O as the reductant.The 6 wtNiO-TiO 2 and 3 wtCuO-TiO 2 catalysts exhibited the optimal selectivity for methane production, with product yields of ca. 2 lmol/g, respectively, under 4-h irradiation using 77 W mercury lamp.Fan et al. 15 observed methanol production using Ni 2 -doped TiO 2 for CO 2 reduction with 0.2 mol/L of NaOH and Na 2 SO 3 as reductants.An optimal methanol yield of 7.51 lmol/g cat h and 3.59 lmol/g cat h was observed under UV (365 nm) and visible (400-780 nm) light irradiation, respectively, using the 6 wtNi/TiO 2 sample.Improved activity of the doped photocatalysts compared to pure TiO 2 was attributed to Ni 2 acting as an electron trap, thus facilitating enhanced charge separation.The decline in methanol production rate after the optimal doping ratio was exceeded was due to the close proximity of the photogenerated holes and Ni 2 such that the photogenerated electrons required for CO 2 reduction were suppressed. Taking into account the timeframe of irradiation and type of lamp used, the methane and methanol production rate of the optimal catalyst (1.5 wtNi 2 -TiO 2 , 7.71 lmol/g cat h) observed in this present study using the quartz plate system were higher when compared with studies by Rajalakshmi 36 and Fan et al. 15.The improved conversion rates can be attributed to the higher surface area values of the optimal catalyst (92.78 m 2 /g) when compared to 63.05 m 2 /g for Fan et al. 15.Another plausible reason could be the enhanced light distribution efficiency achieved with the quartz plate reactor configuration in this present study (Section 2.3). In order to establish the effect of catalyst carriers on TiO 2 , results from this work were compared to the results of Wang et al. 37 and Nguyen and Wu 38 where extensive research has been conducted using the optical fibre as catalyst carriers.Wang et al. 37 obtained methanol production rate of 11.3 lmol/g cat h when optical fibres coated with NiO/InTaO 4 were used for CO 2 reduction under sunlight.Nguyen and Wu 38 performed CO 2 photoreduction experiments using different doping ratios of 0.25 wt, 0.5 wt and 1 wt where the loading amount for both Cu and Fe was the same.An optimal doping ratio of 0.5 wt was obtained with methane production rate being 0.91 lmol/g cat h after 4 h of UVA irradiation (225 mW/cm 2 ).A comparison between their results and these present results indicates that higher methane and methanol production rates were achieved in this study.Although this does not provide a strong basis as different metal dopants, irradiation time, light intensity and reactors were used, the effect of catalyst carriers in facilitating improved light distribution was established from their results and this present work. Reduced photoactivity was observed after the optimal doping ratio was exceeded in this present study.This result could be due to the coverage of the surface of TiO 2 from the increased metal concentration and thus inhibiting interfacial charge transfer due to insufficient amount of light energy available for activation of all the catalyst particles.Shifu et al. 27 and Liu and Chen 39 observed decreased photoreduction activity when the optimum doping ratio of 1 wt and 0.5 wtNiO was exceeded, respectively.The decreased photoactivity was attributed to the dopants acting as recombination centres of electrons and holes, decreasing the thickness of the space charge layer on the surface of the photocatalyst and thus reducing photon absorption.Gupta and Tripathi 40 reported that when the doping concentration is high, the space charge region becomes very narrow, i.e. the light penetration depth of TiO 2 greatly exceeds the width of the space charge layer, thus causing recombination since there is no driving force to separate them. XRD has established the possibility of Ni 2 being doped into the TiO 2 lattice.Consequently, a number of nano-p-n heterojunctions will be formed when NiO is doped into the lattice of TiO 2 .Fig. 7 shows the schematics of the charge separation in NiO-TiO 2 photocatalyst.The p-n junctions created at equilibrium results in the formation of an internal electric field.Upon light irradiation, this inner electric field separates the photogenerated electron-hole pairs and causes them to travel in opposite directions such that the photogenerated electrons and holes move to conduction band of n-TiO 2 and valence band of p-NiO, respectively 28.In order for product formation to occur, photogenerated carriers (electron hole pairs) must migrate to the surface of TiO 2 and participate in the reduction and oxidation process.The relative position of the band edges of TiO 2 has been reported by Kokorin and Bahnemann 41 to determine its redox functioning, i.e. for reduction to occur, the conduction band (E CB ) of TiO 2 must be more negative than the redox potential level, while oxidation by valence band (E VB ) holes will only occur if the E VB is more positive than the relevant redox potential. The redox potentials of CO 2 to hydrogen, methanol and ethanol at pH 7 and 298 K are A0.41,A0.38 and A0.33 V versus NHE, respectively 42.Based on these values derived from the literature, the E CB level of NiO is sufficiently negative to reduce CO 2 to these products 43.The redox potentials of the other products detected in this study (methane (A0.25 V), ethylene (A0.34 V)) are also less negative than the E CB values of these compounds, and hence, their formation is feasible.Oxidation can also occur on the surface of TiO 2 as the E VB level of NiO is sufficiently positive to oxidize CO 2 to oxygen 43.The results from UV-Vis and XRD discussed in Section 3 already indicate the possibility of efficient electron hole separation occurring due to the charge compensation effect introducing oxygen vacancies.This photogenerated electrons and holes then undergo redox reactions with the electron donors and acceptors adsorbed on the surface of TiO 2 to derive fuels and oxygen as demonstrated in this study. The production rate values for the Ni 2 -TiO 2 -based photocatalyst in the quartz plate photoreactor system is higher than the values of the internally illuminated photoreactor configurations.This improved conversion efficiency demonstrated by the Ni 2 -TiO 2 -based photocatalyst in the quartz plate photoreactor system is due to enhanced charge separation at the junction interface between p-NiO and n-TiO 2 with suitable band potentials.Secondly, the use of quartz which is a conductive material provides a means of transmitting light to the catalyst film which is connected to an external potential that can move excited electrons and thus reducing electron hole recombination to improve process efficiency 8.Lastly, a high ratio of illuminated catalyst surface per effective reactor volume can be achieved with this unique reactor configuration which enables light to be distributed uniformly to the surface of the photocatalyst and thus providing better accessibility of the catalytic surface to photons and the reactants during both UV and visible light irradiation."

    "content": "This work has shown that metal-based catalyst carriers (quartz plate and monolithic structures threaded with optical fibres) enhance the activity of TiO 2 for CO 2 photoreduction in UV and visible light region.The sol-gel-derived Ni 2 -based TiO 2 photocatalysts were found to significantly improve the activity and selectivity of TiO 2 towards UV and visible light region due to the substitutional metal ions not only causing changes in the electronic structure and light absorption properties of TiO 2 , but also altering the surface area, grain size and degree of phase transformation, which is dependent on the metal concentration.The production rate when using the quartz plate photoreactor system was one order of magnitude higher than the internally illuminated monolith system threaded with optical fibres.More importantly, the improved conversion efficiency demonstrated with the use of the quartz plate as catalyst and light carrier is ascribed to the unique reactor configuration which allows better accessibility of the catalytic surface to photons and the reactants during both UV and visible light irradiation.This could also be explained due to the effective charge separation of photogenerated electron/hole pairs from the p-n junction formation for NiO-TiO 2 which suppressed recombination, resulting in CO 2 reduction under UV and visible light.
