    "content": "Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to methanol is a promising method to solve the energy and environmental issues.Herein, copper species with different valences loading on TiO 2 via the oxidizing and reducing atmosphere treatment, denoted as Cu/Ti(air) and Cu/Ti(H 2 ), for CO 2 photoreduction.The methanol yield greatly increased on Cu/Ti(H 2 ) with low-valence copper species, which was 17-fold higher than that of Cu/Ti(air).It showed that the reducing atmosphere generated Ti 3 species and oxygen vacancies on Cu/Ti(H 2 ), leading to richer protons of surface hydroxyls adsorbed on surface and available photo-electrons.In addition, in-situ CO 2 adsorption-DRIFTS suggested that low-valence copper species of Cu/Ti(H 2 ) had better ability of CO 2 activation and CO, HOCO -, HCOOH active intermediates adsorption, which further hydrogenated and conversed to CH 3 OH, with the help of protons and photo-electrons.Therefore, owing to the synergistic effects of surface hydroxyl and low-valence copper species, Cu/Ti(H 2 ) was provided with the superior conversion and selectivity of CO 2 to methanol."

    "content": "Anatase TiO 2 nanoparticles were synthesized by the hydrothermal method.Typically, 20 mL tetrabutyl titanate and 3 mL hydrofluoric acid solution were reacted in a 50 mL teflon-lined autoclave at 180 C for 24 h.The generated white precipitate was collected, washed with ethanol and distilled water to remove fluoric ion, followed by drying at 110 C for 6 h, and finally calcined at 400 C for 4 h in a muffle oven.Then the white powder TiO 2 sample was obtained. Cu/TiO 2 was prepared by deposition-precipitation method.Cu (NO 3 ) 2 solution was added to the mixture of TiO 2 powder and distilled water in proportions of Cu:Ti 5 at.The mixture was stirred under magnetic power for 1 h and a further sonication for 30 min.Then 0.05 M (NH 4 ) 2 CO 3 solution was dropwise to the suspension with stirring until to pH value was 7.After stirring the mixture 30 min, it was aged 2 h at room temperature.Then the solid was separated and washed with distilled water by centrifugation, and dried at 80 C for 24 h.Finally, half of the ground powder was calcined at 400 C for 2 h in a muffle furnace, the obtained sample was denoted as Cu/Ti(air).The last ground powder was pretreated in a quartz tubular furnace in a 7.0 H 2 /Ar flow of 40 mL min -1 at 400 C for 4 h, the obtained sample was denoted as Cu/Ti(H 2 ). X-ray diffraction (XRD) of the Cu/Ti samples was performed on a Philips X'Pert Pro diffractometer with a CuK source ( 0.15418 nm), and X-ray tube operated at 40 kV and 40 mA.Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterization was taken on JEM-2100 F instrument by an acceleration voltage of 200 kV.EDS elemental mapping and high-angle annular dark field-scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) were performed on an JEM-ARM200 F transmission electron microscope.X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was recorded on a PHI 5000 Versa Probe high performance electron spectrometer, on monochromatic Al K radiation (1486.6 eV).The binding energy values were calibrated using the C 1s peak (284.6 eV).UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-vis DRS) was carried on a Shimadzu UV-2401 spectrophotometer in the range of 200-800 nm with the reference of BaSO 4 .Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded on a F-7000 fluorescence spectrophotometer with an excitation light at 320 nm. Electrochemical measurements, including transient photocurrent response, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Mott-Schottky analyses were performed in an electrochemistry workstation (CHI 660, CH Instrument, Shanghai) with three-electrode system.Platinum electrode and Ag/AgCl electrode were used as the counter electrode and the reference electrode, respectively.ITO glass with sample coating on served was used as working electrode.The experiments were operated at room temperature with Na 2 SO 4 solution (0.25 molL -1 ) as electrolyte.300 W Xe lamp was used as the light source.The Mott-Schottky analyses was carried out on 2000 Hz. The in-situ electron spin resonance (in-situ ESR) signal was determined at 77 K by ESR JES FA200 (JEOL) spectrometer, and in-situ ESR under the irradiation of Xenon lamp using trapping agents DMPO (5,5dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide) was used to obtain the signal of DMPO-CO 2 -.The in-situ CO adsorption DRIFTS was measured on a Nicolet 5700 FTIR spectrometer equipped with a highly sensitive mercury cadmium telluride detector cooled by liquid N 2 from 650 cm -1 to 4000 cm -1 at the spectral resolution of 4 cm -1 .Before adsorption CO, sample was purged with a N 2 flow of 40 mL min -1 at 150 C for 1.5 h, then cool down to room temperature and collected this spectroscopy as background.Then CO was introduced into the cell with a flow of 15 mL min -1 and the IR spectra were recorded once for 3 min.The insitu CO 2 adsorption DRIFTS spectra were collected as the same as the CO-adsorption except for the CO 2 instead of CO.After the CO 2 adsorption, Xe lamp was turn on to get the interaction of CO 2 adsorption DRIFTS spectra on samples under light irradiation. The performance of CO 2 photoreduction of the as-prepared Cu/Ti catalysts were carried out under the irradiation of a 300 W xenon lamp in a pressure-tight reactor, and its temperature control system was made of stainless steel with quartz windows at the top.In a typical experimental process, 50 mg of catalyst and 5 mL water was added into a 50 mL teflon-lined autoclave.The mixture was ultrasonic for 20 min to uniformly disperse.High purity CO 2 was introduced up to 0.4 MPa, and the reactor kept at 60 C. The mixture was irradiated for 8 h with stirring, and the products, including the gas and liquid were analyzed by a gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a thermal conduction detector (TCD).The detection of methanol is carried out on the GC-FID using the headspace sampler.The column used in GC is a low polar capillary column (HF-5), the dimension is 50 m0.53mm (ID)1.0m.In addition, the temperature of the injector is 260 C, the temperature of the column oven is 80 C, and the temperature of the FID detector is 180 C, N 2 was used as the carrier gas.First, two standard curves of high and low concentration were established.Before detection, the column pressure and split ratio were adjusted, the reaction mixture was filtered to obtain the liquid phase product, and the injection needle was used, and then according to the corresponding concentration range to determine the methanol concentration in the sample.The activity of CO 2 photoreduction was calculated by the following equations: The selectivity of methanol was calculated: where, A CO was the peak area of CO, A CH4 was the peak area of CH 4 , A 1 was the standard peak area of CO, A 2 was the standard peak area of CH 4 , C s and C s were the standard concentration of CO and CH 4 , respectively, C s was the concentration of methanol, P was the pressure in reactor, V r was the reactor volume, V s was the volume of methanol, R was universal gas constant, T was reactor temperature, m cat was catalyst weight."

    "content": "The phase structures of Cu/Ti(air), Cu/Ti(H 2 ) and TiO 2 samples were investigated by XRD characterization.As displayed in Fig. 1a, the diffraction peaks 2 of ca.25.3 , 38.0 , 48.0 , 53.9 , 55.1 , 62.8 , and 68.7 were ascribed to the crystal planes (101), (004), ( 200), (105), (211), (204), and (116) of anatase TiO 2 (PDF-71-1166), respectively.Both on Cu/Ti(air) and Cu/Ti(H 2 ), only the signal of TiO 2 was observed, and no other signals attributed to copper species were found, which suggested that copper species were low crystallinity or the low loading content was beyond the limitation of XRD detection 31. The morphologies and nanostructures of Cu/Ti(air) and Cu/Ti(H 2 ) samples were further determined by TEM.As shown in Fig. S1, it could be observed that the TiO 2 nanoparticles with irregular shapes of ca. 30 nm were obtained, and the different pretreatment atmospheres had no influence on the morphologies of Cu/Ti(air) and Cu/Ti(H 2 ) samples. Besides, the HRTEM images were used to define the possible species, as well as the exposed crystal plane.Both lattice spacings of Cu/Ti(air) and Cu/Ti(H 2 ) samples were 0.35 nm, corresponding to the (101) plane of anatase TiO 2 32.Furthermore, the EDS-mapping images were employed to confirm the existing of copper species.In Fig. 1b and Fig. S2, the elements of Ti, O, Cu were distributed on the Cu/Ti(H 2 ) and Cu/Ti(air) samples.Therefore, combined with the XRD results and EDS-mapping element images, it was showed that the copper species were successfully loaded on TiO 2 .However, compared with mapping element images of Cu, it could be found that the Cu species was facilitated to highly-disperse on Cu/Ti(H 2 ), while accumulate on Cu/Ti(air).According to the fact that vacancies in the support was helpful for the dispersion of surface species, the information of vacancies of Cu/Ti(H 2 ) and Cu/Ti(air) were discussed as followed. The oxygen vacancies of Cu/Ti(H 2 ) and Cu/Ti(air) were carried out on the instruments of low-temperature EPR at 77 K and XPS spectra.In Fig. 2a, when introducing Cu species, a new signal at g 2.011 appeared.According to the literature, the signal was attributed to oxygen vacancies on the surface of TiO 2 33.Generally, the signal intensity was proportional to the concentration of oxygen vacancies.On the basis of that, there was richer oxygen vacancies on Cu/Ti(H 2 ) than Cu/Ti(air), due to the inevitable reduction of TiO 2 support.In addition, the Ti 2p of XPS spectra also confirm the above result.In Fig. 2b, the XPS spectra of Ti 2p displayed two peaks at the binding energy of ca.458.7 eV and 464.5 eV, which were assigned to Ti 4 2p 3/2 and 2p 1/2 , respectively 34.Compared with Cu/Ti(air), the binding energies of Cu/Ti(H 2 ) were shifted to the lower values, suggesting that the Ti 3 species was present because of the exsting of oxygen vacancies, which was consistant to the EPR result. Moreover, the XPS spectra of O 1s of Cu/Ti(H 2 ) and Cu/Ti(air) were showed in Fig. 2c.The broad peak was fitted into three peaks, i.e., the peaks centered at ca. 532.0, 531.0, and 529.8 eV were associated with chemisorbed oxygen related to hydroxyl or the adsorbed H 2 O species on surface (O ad ), oxygen ions in oxygen vacancies (O v ), and the lattice oxygen in TiO 2 (O L ), respectively 35.The ratios of I Ov /I OL and I Oad /I OL were calculated and showed in Table S1, respectively.The content of oxygen vacancies followed the order of Cu/Ti(H 2 ) Cu/Ti(air), and the generated vacancy was beneficial for chemisorbed oxygen species related to hydroxyl on surface.Therefore, due to the oxygen vacancy, more hydroxyl species was formed on Cu/Ti(H 2 ) than Cu/Ti(air). In addition, the water contact angles were determined in comparison to describe the different hydrophilicity.In Fig. 2d, the contact angles of Cu/Ti(H 2 ) and Cu/Ti(air) were 26.4 and 44.4 , respectively.It had been reported that the the hydrophilicity of the sample was closely related with the oxygen-containing species on surface, and the low contact angle suggested an excellent hydrophilicity 36.On the basis of that, Cu/Ti(H 2 ) was provided with lower contact angle, indicating that it had better hydrophilicity and richer hydroxyl species than that of Cu/Ti (air), which was similar to the O 1s XPS result.Combined with the above characterizations of low-temperature EPR, XPS, and contact angles, it could be suggested that owing to richer oxygen vacancies, Cu/Ti(H 2 ) had more chemisorbed oxygen species related to hydroxyl on surface, which could act as the proton source for CO 2 photoreduction to CH 3 OH. In general, the oxygen vacancy was indispensable for photogenerated charge transfer.Therefore, the PL spectra and EIS Nyquist plots were used to determine it.In Fig. S2a, obviously, the emission intensity of Cu/Ti(H 2 ) in the PL spectra was lower than that of Cu/Ti (air), which indicated the more available photo-generated electrons on Cu/Ti(H 2 ).In addition, the EIS result was carried out and showed in Fig. S2b to confirm this result.On the basis of that, richer oxygen vacancies on Cu/Ti(H 2 ) promoted the more surface hydroxyl and photoelectron generation. As all known, the valence state of Cu species play an important role in CO 2 adsorption/activation, intermediate formation and product selectivity of CO 2 photoreduction in the perspective of thermodynamics and kinetics.The surface Cu species of Cu/Ti(H 2 ) and Cu/Ti(air) were analyzed by XPS, UV-vis absorption spectra, and CO adsorption DRIFTS (Fig. 3a-c).In previous literature, the primary peak at ca. 934.4 eV and satellite peaks at ca. 942.0 and 945.0 eV were associated to Cu 2 , and the peak with binding energy of ca.932.0 eV was assigned to Cu in Cu 2p XPS spectra 37.Notably, the Cu species amount of Cu/Ti(H 2 ) was much more than that of Cu/Ti(air), in Cu/Ti(H 2 ) and Cu/Ti(air), Cu /(Cu Cu 2 ) is 34.0 , 7.0 , respectively.Furthermore, the UV-vis DRS was characterized.In Fig. 3b, when the Cu species was loading on TiO 2 , an absorption in the visible light range was appeared in Cu/Ti(H 2 ) and Cu/Ti(air) samples.Among them, a weak band at ca. 450 nm was noted on Cu/Ti(H 2 ), which was attributed to the formation of Cu 38.Based on the fact that CO was preferentially adsorbed on Cu than Cu 2 sites, we employed the CO-adsorption DRIFTS technology to confirm that Cu/Ti(H 2 ) had more Cu content.As showed in Fig. 3c, there was a band at ca. 2110 cm -1 , which was attributed to the copper carbonyl (Cu -CO) species 39.The peak intensity of Cu -CO species was more obvious on Cu/Ti(H 2 ) than that of Cu/Ti(air).Therefore, combined with the results of XPS, UV-vis absorption spectra, and CO adsorption DRIFTS, it could be suggested that the main Cu species was the low valence state, i.e., Cu on Cu/Ti(H 2 ), while Cu 2 species was present on Cu/Ti(air). Furthermore, the influences of Cu species with different valences on the CO 2 adsorption/activation were investigated in comparison.The in situ ESR spectra were carried out with CO 2 and light irradiation on Cu/Ti (H 2 ) and Cu/Ti(air) samples in Fig. 3d.The typical signal of DMPO- CO 2 -was detected on Cu/Ti(H 2 ) and Cu/Ti(air) samples, except for TiO 2 , which suggested that copper species was beneficial for CO 2 adsorption/activation.The signal intensity was ordered as Cu/Ti (H 2 ) Cu/Ti(air), demonstrating Cu/Ti(H 2 ) had better ability of CO 2 adsorption/activation to CO 2 -, owing to the low valence state of Cu species. The in-situ CO 2 adsorption DRIFTS under dark were further carried out to describe the different interactions between CO 2 molecules on Cu/ Ti(H 2 ) and Cu/Ti(air) catalysts, respectively.In Fig. 4, according to the rulers of 0.02 and 0.005 on Cu/Ti(H 2 ) and Cu/Ti(air), respectively, it was suggested that CO 2 reactant was more facilitated to adsorb on Cu/Ti (H 2 ) than Cu/Ti(air).As mentioned in literature, the bands at about 1680, 1560, and 1377 cm -1 were ascribed to (CO 3 ) of bidentate carbonate 40, and the peaks at about 1615, 1601, 1485, and 1201 cm -1 were assigned to carboxylate (COO -), formate (HCOO -), monodentate carbonate (m-CO 3 2-), and hydrocarboxylate (HCO 3 -), respectively 414243.It could be found that, the existing forms of CO 2 chemically adsorbed on Cu/Ti(H 2 ) and Cu/Ti(air) were similar, except for formate HCOO -and HCO 3 -species.The different chemically adsorbed species suggested that hydrogenation process of CO 2 molecules was easilier happened on Cu/Ti(H 2 ), which might be resulted from the richer surface hydroxyls as a proton source. The photocatalytic performances of CO 2 reduction on Cu/Ti(air), Cu/Ti(H 2 ) and TiO 2 samples were evaluated, which was operated in the presence of water vapor under the irradiation of full spectrum.The corresponding results of photocatalytic performances were displayed in Fig. 5.It could be found that the products of CO, CH 4 and CH 3 OH were generated on TiO 2 -based samples after light illumination for 8 h.Interestingly, when the Cu species was loading on TiO 2 , the CH 3 OH yield was increased, and the phenomenon was more obvious on H 2 pretreated Cu/Ti(H 2 ) sample.Cu/Ti(H 2 ) was provided with the CH 3 OH yield of 53.75 mol g -1 h -1 , which was 17-fold higher than that of Cu/Ti(air). Cu/Ti(H 2 ) also have the good stability which was showed in Fig. S3.In addition, the CH 3 OH selectivity of Cu/Ti(H 2 ) was also enhanced, i.e., 98.85 .It was proposed that the increased CH 3 OH yield on Cu/Ti(H 2 ) was resulted from more oxygen vacancy and Cu species, which promoted the richer surface hydroxyl formation, available photo-generated electrons, and enhanced ability of CO 2 adsorption/activation.Moreover, the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to CH 3 OH of other related materials in literatures are compared in Table S2.In a word, the H 2 pretreated Cu/Ti (H 2 ) sample possessed some advantages in the application of CO 2 photoconversion to CH 3 OH. Furthermore, the in-situ CO 2 adsorption DRIFTS under light irradiation were performed on Cu/Ti(H 2 ) and Cu/Ti(air) samples to determine the intermediate species and explore the reaction mechanism.The corresponding in situ DRIFTS at different illumination times were showed in Fig. 6.According to the different rulers in DRIFTS, it also was suggested that Cu/Ti(H 2 ) had better ability of CO 2 activation and photoreduction than Cu/Ti(air), owing to its more active sites.In Fig. 6a, a broad band ranged from 3500-3000 cm -1 originated from OH vibration were more obvious on Cu/Ti(H 2 ) sample, as well as characteristic bands in the 3000-2700 cm -1 region attributed to the vibration of (C -H) for formaldehyde and a (CH 3 ) for methoxy 44.In addition, the vibration of (CH 2 ) for the adsorbed formaldehyde at 1432 cm -1 were detected on Cu/Ti(H 2 ) sample with light irradiation, while the above bands was weaker on Cu/Ti(air).The above phenomenon was similar with the results of CO 2 adsorption DRIFTS under dark, that was, the hydrogenation process of CO 2 molecules was easilier happened on Cu/Ti(H 2 ).Because of the strong adsorption of CO species on low-valence copper species of Cu/Ti(H 2 ), CO species further hydrogenated to HCOO -and methoxy via surface hydroxyl protons and photo-electrons.Therefore, the low-valence copper species and hydroxyl protons on Cu/Ti(H 2 ) played important effects on the formation of formate (HCOO -) and methoxy intermediates and CH 3 OH product. Based on the in-situ DRIFTS results, the possible reaction mechanism of CO 2 photoreduction to CH 3 OH on Cu/Ti(H 2 ) was proposed in Fig. 7. Herein, surface hydroxyls as a proton source and Cu species with low valence state for CO 2 adsorption were the key factors for CO 2 molecules photo-hydrogenation to CH 3 OH.The synergistic mechansim were as followed: (1) when CO 2 molecules were introduced into the reactor, its C atom was adsorbed on the Cu species with low valence, because of the interaction between d electron of Cu to orbit of C; and its O atom interacted with a hydroxyl on the TiO 2 vacancy via the hydrogen bond."
