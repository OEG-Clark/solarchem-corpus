    "content": "The reduction of CO 2 to CO over SnS 2 was firstly reported.In this paper, the SnS 2 was synthesized successfully via a hydrothermal method and characterized by XRD, DRS and electrochemical equipment.The results indicate that it can respond to visible light and be probably capable of reducing CO 2 to CO without external bias.The property of reducing CO 2 was further checked out on GS analysis.The CO output reached 80 ppm at the temperature of 25 C, but without temperature control, the yield came to 200 ppm, revealing the temperature plays a very important role in reducing CO 2 to CO.Except trace amount of CH 4 , the CO was the main product with nearly 100 selectivity.These attractive results make us believe that SnS 2 is promising candidate for the reduction of CO 2 ."

    "content": "All reagents used in our experiments were of analytical purity and were used as received without further purification. The SnS 2 sample was synthesized simply by a direct hydrothermal method.Briefly, 5 mmol of citric acid (C 6 H 8 O 7 ) and 1 mmol of stannic chloride hydrate (SnCl into the deionized water.Afterward, the solution was exposed to ultrasonic treatment for 30 min to ensure the homogeneous dispersion of Sn 4 and C 6 H 8 O 7 , and the volume of the solution was kept at 30 mL.Finally, 0.6 g of thiourea (C 3 H 6 N 2 S) was dissolved in the above solution, and the obtained solution was transferred into 40 mL Teflon lined stainless steel autoclaves for a hydrothermal reaction at 180 C for 20 h.After the reaction finished and cooled in the air, the sample was washed with water and ethanol several times, and then was dried at 60 C to obtain the product."

    "content": "The crystal structure of the product was investigated by the powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) method.As demonstrated in Fig. 1A, the sample showed only the characteristic XRD peaks of hexagonal phase SnS 2 (JCPDS card no.23-0677).No diffraction peaks indicative of impurity could be observed.The morphology of the sample has been characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM).The 2D SnS 2 sheets with wrinkles are clearly observed from Fig. 1C and Fig. 1D.The existing of massive wrinkles reveals the SnS 2 sheets stay at high energy state, which may facilitate the photo-reductive property of the sample. The optical absorption property, which is relevant to the electronic structure feature, is considered as a key factor in determining photocatalytic performance.The optical property of SnS 2 sample was examined by UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy as shown in Fig. 1B.It could be observed that SnS 2 shows the wide response spectrum with its fundamental absorption sharp edge rising at about 600 nm, which implies the possibility of photocatalytic activity over SnS 2 under visible-light irradiation.In order to determine the band gap energy (E g ) of the SnS 2 material, we based on the theory of optical absorption for direct band gap semiconductors given as follows: 14 ( -) ahv B hv Eg 1/2 where a, hv and B are absorption coefficient, discrete photon energy and a constant related to the material, respectively.The plot of (ahv) 2 vs. hv for SnS 2 is shown in the inset in Fig. 1B.The linear nature of the curve indicates the existence of direct transition.The band gap energy E g is determined by extrapolating the straight curve portion of the plot to the energy axis.The band gap energy was estimated to be 2.11 eV, which is close to the reported value 15. To check out whether the sample can generate electrons with potential low enough for reducing CO 2 or not, the impedance spectrum of the as-prepared SnS 2 was measured and plotted according to Mott-Schottky principle as shown in Fig. 2A.The result reveals that the V fb of the sample is A 0.69 V ( A 0.445 V vs. NHE), indicating that the potential of the photo-induced electrons in the sample is about A0.445 V (vs.NHE) given that it has been well accepted that the potential values of the photo-excited carriers are approximately equal to that of the energy bands they reside in 16.This means the photo-induced electrons has a lower potential than the reduction potential of CO 2 ( A0.12 V vs. NHE) and likely play a part in the reaction with adsorbed CO 2 .As the process takes place at the surface of the sample, we still cannot make sure the induced electrons take part in the reaction of reduction of CO 2 unless it is ensured that there are electrons transferred to the surface of the SnS 2 sample.To prove that, the current-time curve of the SnS 2 was recorded and are shown in Fig. 2B.During the experiment, an external bias of 0.8 V was added under the period irradiation.When the lamp is on, the current enlarged to about 33 A 10 which is much higher than the current at the situation that the lamp was taken away.This reflects the commendable ability of responding visible light and transferring the photo-excited electrons of the SnS 2 .It should be noted that, after 1000 s on/off cycle, the photocurrent keeps steady as before and appears no decrease in value, which hints the excellent light stability of the as-obtained SnS 2 .The high current density and stability make SnS 2 be a better photocatalyst for CO 2 reduction.The onset potential of the current derived from the sample is around A 0.45 V ( A 0.205 V vs. NHE) as shown in Fig. 3A.This indicates that SnS 2 is capable of reducing the CO 2 to CO without applying external bias, although the current was quite small in the potential range detected (0.0015 mA at A 0.45 V).However, the application of lamp resulted in a slightly increase in the photocurrent owing to the promotion of the electrons concentration (Fig. 3B).Moreover, after the application of light irradiation, the improvements of the photocurrent at A 0.99 V and A 0.34 V (pointed by black arrows) were more pronounced than the rest of the range examined, which may be related to the intrinsic electric structure and favor the process of reducing CO 2 .Cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments using SnS 2 - based electrode were also measured (Fig. 3C), in which the reduction peak at A 0.69 V was observed. The gas-phase CO 2 reduction was carried out in a sealed transparent cell (SnS 2 50 mg) with a quartz window and a cooling system.Prior to the irradiation of a Xe lamp, the reactor was purged with dry nitrogen and then was injected with CO 2 (390 ppm).During the whole photoreaction the temperature of the system was kept at 25 C, and the headspace gas was regularly sampled and then monitored by GC analysis.As shown in Fig. 3D, the CO 2 were gradually photoreduced and the amount of CO was increased bit by bit.In spite of negligible trace amount of CH 4 , the CO was primary product with almost 100 selectivity.The yield of CO over the SnS 2 sample reached 80 ppm after 8 h irradiation, which is very ideal output for pure semiconductor without any modifications.Notably, without the temperature control, the amount of CO increased sharply to nearly 200 ppm, indicating the dependency on temperature for the CO 2 reduction."
