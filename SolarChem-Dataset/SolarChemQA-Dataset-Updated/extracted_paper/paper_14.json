    "content": "The mechanism of photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 and H 2 O over copper oxide promoted titania, Cu(I)/TiO 2 , was investigated by means of in situ DRIFT spectroscopy in combination with isotopically labeled 13 CO 2 .In addition to small amounts of 13 CO, 12 CO was demonstrated to be the primary product of the reaction by the 2115 cm -1 Cu(I)-CO signature, indicating that carbon residues on the catalyst surface are involved in reactions with predominantly photocatalytically activated surface adsorbed water.This was confirmed by prolonged exposure of the catalyst to light and water vapor, which significantly reduced the amount of CO formed in a subsequent experiment in the DRIFT cell.In addition, formation of carboxylates and (bi)carbonates was observed by exposure of the Cu(I)/TiO 2 surface to CO 2 in the dark.These carboxylates and (bi)carbonates decompose upon light irradiation, yielding predominantly CO 2 .At the same time a novel carbonate species is produced (having a main absorption at 1395 cm -1 ) by adsorption of photocatalytically produced CO on the Cu(I)/TiO 2 surface, most likely through a reverse Boudouard reaction of photocatalytically activated CO 2 with carbon residues.The finding that carbon residues are involved in photocatalytic water activation and CO 2 reduction might have important implications for the rates of artificial photosynthesis reported in many studies in the literature, in particular those using photoactive materials synthesized with carbon containing precursors."

    "content": "Material Preparation.Cu(I)/TiO 2 was synthesized by a modified sol-gel method.The precursors titanium(IV) butoxide (TBOT, Ti-(OC 4 H 9 ) 4 ) and copper nitrate (Cu(NO 3 ) 2 2.5H 2 O) were used as received.17 mL of TBOT, 0.15 g of (Cu(NO 3 ) 2 2.5H 2 O), 2 g of polyethylene glycol (PEG), and 102 mL of 0.1 M nitric acid (HNO 3 ) were added to induce hydrolysis, and polycondensation was achieved by thermal treatment at 353 K for 28 h.The final sol was filtered, dried at 423 K for 3 h, and then calcined at 773 K for 5 h with a heating rate of 1 K/min.Based on elemental analysis, 1 (weight basis) copper was deposited.The as-synthesized Cu(I)/TiO 2 catalyst had a grass-green color.A reference Cu(I)/TiO 2 catalyst was prepared according to the same procedure, in the absence of polyethylene glycol (PEG).Finally, TiO 2 was also prepared following the same procedure, only without adding copper nitrate. In Situ Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform Spectroscopy.Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction experiments were carried out using a Nicolet Magna 860 spectrometer, equipped with a liquid N 2 cooled MCT detector, and a three window DRIFTS (Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform Spectroscopy) cell.Two ZnSe windows allowed IR transmission, and a third (Quartz) window allowed the introduction of UV/vis light into the cell.Prior to the illumination experiments, 25 mg of the as-synthesized catalyst were heated up to 393 K in He (30 mL/min) for 0.5 h, to remove the majority of adsorbed water without changing the oxidation state of copper oxide.Before recording a background spectrum of the still grass-green catalyst, CO 2 (50 vol in He, 20 mL/min) was purged for 20 min.For experiments involving water vapor, CO 2 was bubbled through a saturator at room temperature (300 K), which added approximately 4 vol water vapor to the CO 2 feed.During illumination, reactants were held stationary in the cell at room temperature (303 K).In situ IR signals were thus recorded every 10 min under UV/vis light irradiation (100 W Hg lamp, : 250-600 nm). CO 2 (Linde Gas, 99.995), 13 CO 2 (ISOTEC, 99.9 13 C), CO (Linde Gas, 5 in He), and 13 CO (ISOTEC, 99 13 C) were used as received.CO (or 13 CO) adsorption experiments were performed by introducing CO (2500 ppm in He, 20 mL/min) over Cu(I)/TiO 2 for 20 min.To estimate the CO adsorption capacity, He (30 mL/ min) was used to flush the catalyst and remove weakly adsorbed CO molecules. To further illustrate the role of carbonates in photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 , an illumination experiment was conducted in the absence of CO 2 , after pre-exposure of the surface of the catalyst to CO 2 .Specifically a flush-dose cycle of exposure of the catalyst to 13 CO 2 for 20 min, followed by flush in He, was repeated four times, to increase the surface concentration of 13 C-labeled carbonates. Coking Experiments.The catalyst under investigation was also pretreated to achieve different degrees of coking.Coked catalysts were prepared by introducing a batch of fresh Cu(I)/TiO 2 catalyst (70 mg) into an isobutane flow at 873 K (30 mL/min consisting of 1 C 4 H 10 and 50 CO 2 ).By varying the exposure time, variable amounts of coke were successfully deposited on Cu(I)/TiO 2 . Figure 1 shows DRIFT spectra of the Cu(I)/TiO 2 catalyst after 80 min of illumination in different atmospheres, against background spectra of the catalyst obtained after flushing with the different respective gas compositions for 20 min.The spectra are dominated by an absorption band at 2115 cm -1 , which can be assigned to the stretching mode of CO, consistent with literature. 19-21CH 4 , often detected by gas chromatography in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction studies, is not observed, with quantities being too small to be detected in the gas phase in our DRIFT cell (with limited IR path length).Adsorption on the catalyst surface of methane is not expected.CH 3 OH, should be visible in an adsorbed state if formed in sufficient quantity, but is not detected.In an inert (He) and oxidizing atmosphere (10 O 2 /He), a small quantity of CO evolved after 80 min of illumination.In the case of water vapor (spectrum 1c), a significantly higher intensity of the CO band at 2115 cm -1 can be observed.By introducing CO 2 and water vapor (1d), the CO band broadens and blue-shifts to 2117 cm -1 .The broadening of the CO band suggests that CO 2 coadsorption slightly alters the nature of the Cu(I) site.Without H 2 O cofeed (spectrum 1e), CO 2 leads to a CO band of an even higher intensity, which might imply that in the presence of water subsequent hydrogenation of adsorbed CO takes place. 13 origin of the CO product.Spectrum 1f shows two CO bands, at 2069 and 2117 cm -1 .The former one is assigned to adsorbed 13 CO, in agreement with a calculation based on the harmonic equation 22 and spectra after dosing 13 CO over Cu(I)/TiO 2 , which will be described later.Unexpectedly, there is still a majority of 12 CO formed during illumination, despite the absence of 12 CO 2 , demonstrating that carbon residues on the catalyst surface are involved in the reaction.Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed for the as-synthesized catalyst, which showed no distinguishable weight loss, indicating that these residues are present in small quantities and cannot be easily removed by calcination. In the absence of water vapor, the intensity of the band of adsorbed CO was enhanced (compare spectra 1f and 1g), in agreement with the experiment conducted with 12 CO 2 .As expected, in reference experiments over pure TiO 2 , CO absorption bands in the 2115 cm -1 region were absent, indicating that Cu(I) sites serve as a probe to visualize CO formation in IR spectroscopy. Figure 2 shows the spectral development in the region of carbonate absorptions (1200-1800 cm -1 ) during an experiment where Cu(I)/TiO 2 is illuminated in an atmosphere of 13 CO 2 (compare Figure 1g).In the presence of 13 CO 2 , irradiation enhances carbonate intensities.There are also decreasing bands observable (at approximately 1650 and 1210 cm -1 ), indicating that specific surface species are involved in the formation of CO. To further evaluate the dynamics in the intensities of the carbonate vibrations, presaturation of the TiO 2 surface by treatment with 13 CO 2 was conducted.The 13 C-labeled carbonate containing surface was subsequently illuminated in a He atmosphere.The spectral changes are displayed in Figure 3. Clearly 12 CO (2115 cm -1 ) is formed upon illumination, together with a minor amount of 13 CO, in agreement with the data shown in Figure 1.Rather than positive carbonate features, as observed in the presence of gas phase 13 CO 2 , negative features are observed in the spectral region of 1800 to 1200 cm -1 , including these at 1650 and 1210 cm -1 , indicating that carbonates are decomposing upon illumination.This mainly produces gas phase 13 CO 2 , as is evident from IR absorption features at 2280 cm -1 .In addition, the complex spectral signature in the carbonate region contains positive contributions at 1560, 1420, and 1350 cm -1 , which can be assigned to the formation of carbonate species formed by (re)adsorption of CO, as will be discussed in the following paragraph.Finally Figure 3 shows significant depletion in the hydroxyl region (3000 to 4000 cm -1 ), suggesting that hydroxyl groups and surface adsorbed water are participating in the surface reactions. Reference Spectra.To allow a better comprehension of the changes in the carbonate region (see Figures 2 and3), Figure 4 shows the deconvolution of the region of the carbonate bands, formed by exposure of the Cu(I)/TiO 2 catalyst to CO 2 or 13 CO 2 , respectively.The corresponding band assignments are summarized in Table 1.In agreement with literature data, 23,24 we assign the bands to bidentate carbonates (1363, 1554 cm -1 for CO 2 and 1319, 1508 cm -1 for 13 CO 2 ), monodentate carbonates (1409 cm -1 for CO 2 and 1374 cm -1 for 13 CO 2 ), bicarbonates (1481, 1663 cm -1 for CO 2 and 1461, 1649 cm -1 for 13 CO 2 ) and carboxylates (1663 cm -1 for CO 2 and 1649 cm -1 for 13 CO 2 ).The assignment at 1663 and 1649 cm -1 is ambiguous, due to the difficulty of distinguishing the contributions of bicarbonates or carboxylates.The preadsorbed carbonates were in a separate experiment exposed to D 2 O, to evaluate if specific carbonate bands would shift, providing further evidence for spectral assignment.Unfortunately, D 2 O has strong absorptions in the (22) Harmonic equation was useful for calculating the theoretical peak shift for isotopic molecules.The vibration frequency is inverse-proportional to the square root of reduced mass.1200 cm -1 region, disguising any shifts in position of the 1210 cm -1 band.In addition, bands at 1650 and 1210 cm -1 have been assigned to a bent CO 2 -conformation, formed by CO 2 adsorption on Ti 3 -sites in the vicinity of Rh. 16,17 Following this assignment, the 1650 and 1210 cm -1 bands observed in the present study might be associated with CO 2 adsorption in the vicinity of the Cu(I) centers.Among the surface species, bidentate carbonates dominate the spectra and are thermally the most stable species.It must be noted that the control experiments (CO 2 and 13 CO 2 ) over pure TiO 2 synthesized by the same sol-gel method showed similar surface species, which confirms that most carbonates, bicarbonates, and carboxylates are adsorbed on titania, not on copper sites. Figure 5 contains reference spectra obtained by adsorption of CO and 13 CO on the catalyst surface, in the absence or presence of CO 2 .Cu(I)/TiO 2 was first exposed to CO, followed by a He flush.A strong adsorption of CO is observed, with a band composed of two contributions at 2107 and 2115 cm -1 .By introducing 13 CO 2 the band at 2107 cm -1 rapidly disappears, and the band at 2115 cm -1 blue shifts to 2120 cm -1 , in agreement with observations reported in the literature.This blue shift was explained by a dynamic interaction between adsorbed CO and CO 2 molecules from the gas phase. 25,26After removing CO 2 by purging with He, the band of adsorbed CO gradually red shifts back to 2115 cm -1 .The stability of adsorbed CO under illumination is shown in Figure 5b.Clearly desorption is stimulated by illumination, in view of the significant reduction in intensity of the band at 2070 cm -1 .A slight positive growth is observed at 2115 cm -1 , again indicative of conversion of a carbon residue by surface adsorbed water. Figure 6 shows the (deconvoluted) carbonate intensities formed upon exposure of the Cu(I)/TiO 2 catalyst to CO and 13 CO, respectively.While the features are similar to those obtained by adsorption of CO 2 (compare Figure 4), intensity differences can be noted.In particular, bands at 1563, 1419, and 1349 cm -1 are indicative of CO adsorbed on surface Ti(O) sites as bidentate and monodentate carbonates, at 1492 cm -1 as bicarbonates, and at 1665 cm -1 as the contribution of bicarbonates and carboxylates.A corresponding peak assignment can be made for 13 CO adsorbed on surface Ti(O) sites at 1569, 1378, and 1315 cm -1 as bidentate and monodentate carbonates, at 1468 cm -1 as bicarbonates, and at 1645 cm -1 as the contribution of bicarbonates and carboxylates. Illumination of Pretreated Cu(I)/TiO 2 .To eliminate the contribution of surface carbon species, the catalyst was pretreated for a prolonged period of time in moist air under UV illumination.The subsequent experiment with preloaded 13 CO 2 is shown in Figure 7.As compared to the fresh catalyst, much less CO is produced upon illumination.Figure 7 also shows the amount of CO evolved for a catalyst that was prepared without PEG in the synthesis mixture.An even smaller CO formation rate is observed. To further evaluate the influence of carbon residues on CO 2 reduction rates over Cu(I)/TiO 2 , coked catalysts were prepared with variable carbon content.By thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) it was determined that coke amounts of 0.009, 0.144, and 0.297 wt were obtained after reaction times in the applied iso-butene/CO 2 mixture of 10, 30, and 60 min, respectively.Figure 8a shows the DRIFT spectra of coked catalysts recorded after 80 min of illumination in the presence of 13 CO 2 .Only the 12 CO band at 2117 cm -1 was observed for all the coked catalysts.Furthermore, compared to as-synthesized Cu(I)/TiO 2 , coked catalysts show a smaller CO production after 80 min of illumination.The more coke is present on the surface of the Cu(I)/TiO 2 catalyst, the less CO is formed upon light irradiation.In the spectral region of carbonates (1200-1600 cm -1 ), the same tendency is exhibited: less carbonates accumulate on the surface the higher the coke level of the applied catalyst. To further characterize the coked Cu(I)/TiO 2 catalysts, DRIFT analyses of adsorbed CO were performed (Figure 8b), in the presence of gas phase CO (2500 ppm), and after a subsequent He flush.A significant amount of adsorbed CO can be observed in the presence of gas phase CO, which decreases as a function of increasing coke level.Furthermore, the stability of the adsorbed CO is smaller than observed for the as-synthesized Cu(I)/TiO 2 catalyst (see Figure 5), in view of the significant reduction in intensity after a He flush.It should be noted that the intensities of adsorbed CO are significantly higher than those obtained after 80 min of illumination in the presence of CO 2 , which demonstrates that there are still enough Cu(I) sites to allow CO adsorption.This shows that for coked catalysts the decreasing CO band (Figure 5a) is related to a smaller CO formation rate upon light irradiation.Finally, the intensity differences and changes in the carbonate region suggest that the Cu(I)/TiO 2 surface is indeed largely covered by coke, leading to lower intensities and the lower stability of the CO induced carbonate species. Reduction.The experimental data presented herein demonstrate that CO is formed in significant quantities over Cu(I)/TiO 2 catalyst during illumination in the presence of CO 2 , in particular if PEG is applied in the synthesis procedure.Using isotopically labeled 13 CO 2 , it is shown that carbon residues and surface adsorbed water significantly contribute to the formation of CO.The ratio of 12 CO over 13 CO is approximately 6. Two reactions can be proposed to explain the formation of 12 CO, i.e. the reverse Boudouard reaction, eq 1, and H 2 O induced photocatalytic surface carbon gasification, eq 2: In view of the high 12 CO over 13 CO ratio, eq 2 must have a predominant contribution to the products formed.The source of H 2 O is probably surface adsorbed water, which is activated upon illumination.In addition it is well-known that surface OH groups are involved in oxidation reactions over TiO 2 surfaces, which might also contribute to CO formation. As stated in the introduction, usually additional products are obtained upon illumination of a Cu(I)/TiO 2 catalyst in the presence of CO 2 , including methanol or methane.In view of 13 CO 2 ' 12 C' f 13 CO 12 CO (1) the small quantities produced, we have not observed any spectral features that can be related to these species.However, it is to be expected that by consecutive reaction with H 2 , CO formed by eqs 1 and 2 can be converted to e.g.CH 4 . Besides the isotopically labeled experiments, it was also demonstrated by prolonged exposure to UV-irradiation in the presence of water vapor that eq 2 plays a major role in the formation of CO over Cu(I)/TiO 2 .In a way it is surprising that adding additional coke did not lead to extensive formation of CO.Apparently the surface coverage achieved was that considerable that the surface had become highly hydrophobic.This limits the reactive adsorption of CO 2 and, more importantly, significantly decreases the extent of surface hydration, as witnessed by the smaller intensity of the negative water bands in the 1620-1680 cm -1 region (Figure 8a).Clearly this is detrimental to the production of CO.Furthermore, the coke layer might simply prevent efficient light activation of the catalyst by absorption of light by the carbon layer, as was observed e.g. by Xia et al. 27 The surface chemistry of Cu(I)/TiO 2 in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction is discussed in more detail in the following. Surface Carbonate Chemistry.The Cu(I)/TiO 2 catalyst is very reactive toward CO 2 and CO at room temperature, leading to various carboxylate, bicarbonate, and carbonate species.Generally IR intensities are higher upon exposure to CO 2 .When CO 2 approaches Cu(I)/TiO 2 , carbonate species likely form on titania sites which are not fully coordinated, i.e. in the vicinity of the Cu(I) centers.This is in agreement with a study of Rasko et al., who investigated CO 2 adsorption and photocatalytic decomposition over prereduced Rh/TiO 2 . 16,17It was demonstrated in their study that, on prereduced Rh/TiO 2 , oxygen vacancies in the vicinity of Rh offered sites for carboxylate formation, specifically with a C atom of CO 2 linked to Rh and one O atom of CO 2 bonded to the oxygen vacancy of titania.It is generally accepted that, by illumination with light of sufficient energy, electron-hole pairs are generated in titania.Rasko et al. propose that electrons are transferred to CO 2 , yielding CO, while holes are involved in neutralizing the Ti 3 sites to Ti 4 .It is thus proposed by Rasko et al. that bent adsorbed CO 2 species are the precursor of CO, with the oxygen atom being incorporated in the TiO 2 , changing the oxidation state from Ti 3 to Ti 4 .Also in our study we observe a depletion of the 1650 and 1220 cm -1 bands upon illumination, suggesting that these might be involved in the formation of CO by CO 2 dissociation.However, rather than being incorporated in the Cu(I)/TiO 2 lattice, we believe the remaining oxygen is predominantly transferred to residual carbon, yielding an additional CO molecule, according to eq 1. The experiment conducted on a 13 CO 2 pretreated catalyst (Figure 3) demonstrates that, in addition to carboxylates/ bicarbonates, CO 2 induced surface carbonates are also unstable upon illumination, yielding 13 CO 2 .As previously discussed, the large selectivity for 12 CO in the experiment is related to water induced reactions of carbon residues, according to eq 2. This is followed by 12 CO adsorption on Cu(I) sites (2115 cm -1 ) and surface TiO 2 sites, yielding 12 CO induced carbonates, explaining the growth of the demonstrated features (at 1560, 1420, and 1350 cm -1 ) in Figure 3. It should be noted that the (bi)carbonate and carboxylate species formed are most likely a strong function of the extent of surface hydration of the applied TiO 2 catalysts.Morterra 28 has evaluated the interaction of CO with TiO 2 surfaces.He demonstrated that removal of water molecules and decomposition of surface hydroxyl groups (OH) lead to the formation of surface Lewis acid sites that reversibly chemisorb CO at ambient temperature.While Morterra removed water and hydroxyl groups by evacuation in a vacuum IR cell, it is obvious (Figure 3) that the degree of hydration is also largely affected by the illumination procedure. Artificial Photosynthesis, Fact or Fiction?Many (recent) studies discuss the performance of modified TiO 2 catalysts in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 . 29Generally methane and/ or methanol are the products reported to be formed.In view of our study, the data reported in various related studies should be interpreted with caution.Frei and co-workers already observed for mesoporous materials that carbon residues can be involved in the production of primary products in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 . 3031132 In view of our data, also for crystalline TiO 2 materials, water induced gasification of these carbon residues might be affecting the product quantities and distribution (reaction 2).This is particularly true if alkoxides (propoxide, butoxide) were used as the precursor 33 or if carbon supported TiO 2 was used. 27Also in the synthesis procedure of N-doped TiO 2 , organic solvents were used, the residue of which might have contributed to the observed activity. 34Clearly, contribution of these reactions leads to an overestimation of the rate of the real artificial photosynthesis reactions, such as 2CO 2 4H 2 O f 2CH 3 OH 3O 2 .It is highly recommended in future studies on photocatalytic CO 2 reactions to add a test of activity in the absence of CO 2 but in the presence of H 2 O to exclude the participation of catalyst associated carbon residues in the formation of products. While there is no doubt that carbon residues contribute to catalytic performance, based on our study we cannot entirely exclude artificial photosynthesis. 13CO was formed in various experiments, and it is necessary to isolate the reversed Boudouard reaction from true artificial photosynthesis.This would require careful evaluation of the production of O 2 .To close the oxygen balance is however extremely difficult, and usually irreproducible data are obtained due to fluctuations in background oxygen pressures.The most conclusive evidence that CO is formed in the absence of carbon residues is again provided by Frei and co-workers 18 in a high vacuum IR cell, in the case of isolated Ti sites in mesoporous materials.Ozonation was a very efficient way of removing residual carbon in their study.The onward CO 2 reduction performed under 13 CO 2 and H 2 O showed merely 13 CO production, which is significant evidence for true artificial photosynthesis.However, mechanistic studies on highly pure crystalline metal oxide systems are needed to definitively prove that artificial photosynthesis over these materials is fact as well as to further reveal the chemical pathway of CO 2 reduction, including the complexity in the dynamics of surface carbonates. Carbon residues largely participate in the formation of CO over Cu-promoted crystalline TiO 2 catalysts, as demonstrated by the combined use of DRIFT spectroscopy and 13 C labeled CO 2 .These residues are formed during the catalyst synthesis procedures, often involving the use of Ti-alkoxides and organic solvents, such as polyethylene glycol (PEG).Removal of these residues by thermal activation in air is incomplete, while prolonged exposure to water vapor and UV-irradiation is more efficient.Coking of Cu(I)/TiO 2 showed that extensive carbon coverage of Cu(I)/TiO 2 diminishes CO formation during illumination in the presence of CO 2 .

    "content": "Figure 1 shows DRIFT spectra of the Cu(I)/TiO 2 catalyst after 80 min of illumination in different atmospheres, against background spectra of the catalyst obtained after flushing with the different respective gas compositions for 20 min.The spectra are dominated by an absorption band at 2115 cm -1 , which can be assigned to the stretching mode of CO, consistent with literature. 19-21CH 4 , often detected by gas chromatography in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction studies, is not observed, with quantities being too small to be detected in the gas phase in our DRIFT cell (with limited IR path length).Adsorption on the catalyst surface of methane is not expected.CH 3 OH, should be visible in an adsorbed state if formed in sufficient quantity, but is not detected.In an inert (He) and oxidizing atmosphere (10 O 2 /He), a small quantity of CO evolved after 80 min of illumination.In the case of water vapor (spectrum 1c), a significantly higher intensity of the CO band at 2115 cm -1 can be observed.By introducing CO 2 and water vapor (1d), the CO band broadens and blue-shifts to 2117 cm -1 .The broadening of the CO band suggests that CO 2 coadsorption slightly alters the nature of the Cu(I) site.Without H 2 O cofeed (spectrum 1e), CO 2 leads to a CO band of an even higher intensity, which might imply that in the presence of water subsequent hydrogenation of adsorbed CO takes place. 13 origin of the CO product.Spectrum 1f shows two CO bands, at 2069 and 2117 cm -1 .The former one is assigned to adsorbed 13 CO, in agreement with a calculation based on the harmonic equation 22 and spectra after dosing 13 CO over Cu(I)/TiO 2 , which will be described later.Unexpectedly, there is still a majority of 12 CO formed during illumination, despite the absence of 12 CO 2 , demonstrating that carbon residues on the catalyst surface are involved in the reaction.Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed for the as-synthesized catalyst, which showed no distinguishable weight loss, indicating that these residues are present in small quantities and cannot be easily removed by calcination. In the absence of water vapor, the intensity of the band of adsorbed CO was enhanced (compare spectra 1f and 1g), in agreement with the experiment conducted with 12 CO 2 .As expected, in reference experiments over pure TiO 2 , CO absorption bands in the 2115 cm -1 region were absent, indicating that Cu(I) sites serve as a probe to visualize CO formation in IR spectroscopy. Figure 2 shows the spectral development in the region of carbonate absorptions (1200-1800 cm -1 ) during an experiment where Cu(I)/TiO 2 is illuminated in an atmosphere of 13 CO 2 (compare Figure 1g).In the presence of 13 CO 2 , irradiation enhances carbonate intensities.There are also decreasing bands observable (at approximately 1650 and 1210 cm -1 ), indicating that specific surface species are involved in the formation of CO. To further evaluate the dynamics in the intensities of the carbonate vibrations, presaturation of the TiO 2 surface by treatment with 13 CO 2 was conducted.The 13 C-labeled carbonate containing surface was subsequently illuminated in a He atmosphere.The spectral changes are displayed in Figure 3. Clearly 12 CO (2115 cm -1 ) is formed upon illumination, together with a minor amount of 13 CO, in agreement with the data shown in Figure 1.Rather than positive carbonate features, as observed in the presence of gas phase 13 CO 2 , negative features are observed in the spectral region of 1800 to 1200 cm -1 , including these at 1650 and 1210 cm -1 , indicating that carbonates are decomposing upon illumination.This mainly produces gas phase 13 CO 2 , as is evident from IR absorption features at 2280 cm -1 .In addition, the complex spectral signature in the carbonate region contains positive contributions at 1560, 1420, and 1350 cm -1 , which can be assigned to the formation of carbonate species formed by (re)adsorption of CO, as will be discussed in the following paragraph.Finally Figure 3 shows significant depletion in the hydroxyl region (3000 to 4000 cm -1 ), suggesting that hydroxyl groups and surface adsorbed water are participating in the surface reactions. Reference Spectra.To allow a better comprehension of the changes in the carbonate region (see Figures 2 and3), Figure 4 shows the deconvolution of the region of the carbonate bands, formed by exposure of the Cu(I)/TiO 2 catalyst to CO 2 or 13 CO 2 , respectively.The corresponding band assignments are summarized in Table 1.In agreement with literature data, 23,24 we assign the bands to bidentate carbonates (1363, 1554 cm -1 for CO 2 and 1319, 1508 cm -1 for 13 CO 2 ), monodentate carbonates (1409 cm -1 for CO 2 and 1374 cm -1 for 13 CO 2 ), bicarbonates (1481, 1663 cm -1 for CO 2 and 1461, 1649 cm -1 for 13 CO 2 ) and carboxylates (1663 cm -1 for CO 2 and 1649 cm -1 for 13 CO 2 ).The assignment at 1663 and 1649 cm -1 is ambiguous, due to the difficulty of distinguishing the contributions of bicarbonates or carboxylates.The preadsorbed carbonates were in a separate experiment exposed to D 2 O, to evaluate if specific carbonate bands would shift, providing further evidence for spectral assignment.Unfortunately, D 2 O has strong absorptions in the (22) Harmonic equation was useful for calculating the theoretical peak shift for isotopic molecules.The vibration frequency is inverse-proportional to the square root of reduced mass.1200 cm -1 region, disguising any shifts in position of the 1210 cm -1 band.In addition, bands at 1650 and 1210 cm -1 have been assigned to a bent CO 2 -conformation, formed by CO 2 adsorption on Ti 3 -sites in the vicinity of Rh. 16,17 Following this assignment, the 1650 and 1210 cm -1 bands observed in the present study might be associated with CO 2 adsorption in the vicinity of the Cu(I) centers.Among the surface species, bidentate carbonates dominate the spectra and are thermally the most stable species.It must be noted that the control experiments (CO 2 and 13 CO 2 ) over pure TiO 2 synthesized by the same sol-gel method showed similar surface species, which confirms that most carbonates, bicarbonates, and carboxylates are adsorbed on titania, not on copper sites. Figure 5 contains reference spectra obtained by adsorption of CO and 13 CO on the catalyst surface, in the absence or presence of CO 2 .Cu(I)/TiO 2 was first exposed to CO, followed by a He flush.A strong adsorption of CO is observed, with a band composed of two contributions at 2107 and 2115 cm -1 .By introducing 13 CO 2 the band at 2107 cm -1 rapidly disappears, and the band at 2115 cm -1 blue shifts to 2120 cm -1 , in agreement with observations reported in the literature.This blue shift was explained by a dynamic interaction between adsorbed CO and CO 2 molecules from the gas phase. 25,26After removing CO 2 by purging with He, the band of adsorbed CO gradually red shifts back to 2115 cm -1 .The stability of adsorbed CO under illumination is shown in Figure 5b.Clearly desorption is stimulated by illumination, in view of the significant reduction in intensity of the band at 2070 cm -1 .A slight positive growth is observed at 2115 cm -1 , again indicative of conversion of a carbon residue by surface adsorbed water. Figure 6 shows the (deconvoluted) carbonate intensities formed upon exposure of the Cu(I)/TiO 2 catalyst to CO and 13 CO, respectively.While the features are similar to those obtained by adsorption of CO 2 (compare Figure 4), intensity differences can be noted.In particular, bands at 1563, 1419, and 1349 cm -1 are indicative of CO adsorbed on surface Ti(O) sites as bidentate and monodentate carbonates, at 1492 cm -1 as bicarbonates, and at 1665 cm -1 as the contribution of bicarbonates and carboxylates.A corresponding peak assignment can be made for 13 CO adsorbed on surface Ti(O) sites at 1569, 1378, and 1315 cm -1 as bidentate and monodentate carbonates, at 1468 cm -1 as bicarbonates, and at 1645 cm -1 as the contribution of bicarbonates and carboxylates. Illumination of Pretreated Cu(I)/TiO 2 .To eliminate the contribution of surface carbon species, the catalyst was pretreated for a prolonged period of time in moist air under UV illumination.The subsequent experiment with preloaded 13 CO 2 is shown in Figure 7.As compared to the fresh catalyst, much less CO is produced upon illumination.Figure 7 also shows the amount of CO evolved for a catalyst that was prepared without PEG in the synthesis mixture.An even smaller CO formation rate is observed. To further evaluate the influence of carbon residues on CO 2 reduction rates over Cu(I)/TiO 2 , coked catalysts were prepared with variable carbon content.By thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) it was determined that coke amounts of 0.009, 0.144, and 0.297 wt were obtained after reaction times in the applied iso-butene/CO 2 mixture of 10, 30, and 60 min, respectively.Figure 8a shows the DRIFT spectra of coked catalysts recorded after 80 min of illumination in the presence of 13 CO 2 .Only the 12 CO band at 2117 cm -1 was observed for all the coked catalysts.Furthermore, compared to as-synthesized Cu(I)/TiO 2 , coked catalysts show a smaller CO production after 80 min of illumination.The more coke is present on the surface of the Cu(I)/TiO 2 catalyst, the less CO is formed upon light irradiation.In the spectral region of carbonates (1200-1600 cm -1 ), the same tendency is exhibited: less carbonates accumulate on the surface the higher the coke level of the applied catalyst. To further characterize the coked Cu(I)/TiO 2 catalysts, DRIFT analyses of adsorbed CO were performed (Figure 8b), in the presence of gas phase CO (2500 ppm), and after a subsequent He flush.A significant amount of adsorbed CO can be observed in the presence of gas phase CO, which decreases as a function of increasing coke level.Furthermore, the stability of the adsorbed CO is smaller than observed for the as-synthesized Cu(I)/TiO 2 catalyst (see Figure 5), in view of the significant reduction in intensity after a He flush.It should be noted that the intensities of adsorbed CO are significantly higher than those obtained after 80 min of illumination in the presence of CO 2 , which demonstrates that there are still enough Cu(I) sites to allow CO adsorption.This shows that for coked catalysts the decreasing CO band (Figure 5a) is related to a smaller CO formation rate upon light irradiation.Finally, the intensity differences and changes in the carbonate region suggest that the Cu(I)/TiO 2 surface is indeed largely covered by coke, leading to lower intensities and the lower stability of the CO induced carbonate species. Reduction.The experimental data presented herein demonstrate that CO is formed in significant quantities over Cu(I)/TiO 2 catalyst during illumination in the presence of CO 2 , in particular if PEG is applied in the synthesis procedure.Using isotopically labeled 13 CO 2 , it is shown that carbon residues and surface adsorbed water significantly contribute to the formation of CO.The ratio of 12 CO over 13 CO is approximately 6. Two reactions can be proposed to explain the formation of 12 CO, i.e. the reverse Boudouard reaction, eq 1, and H 2 O induced photocatalytic surface carbon gasification, eq 2: In view of the high 12 CO over 13 CO ratio, eq 2 must have a predominant contribution to the products formed.The source of H 2 O is probably surface adsorbed water, which is activated upon illumination.In addition it is well-known that surface OH groups are involved in oxidation reactions over TiO 2 surfaces, which might also contribute to CO formation. As stated in the introduction, usually additional products are obtained upon illumination of a Cu(I)/TiO 2 catalyst in the presence of CO 2 , including methanol or methane.In view of 13 CO 2 ' 12 C' f 13 CO 12 CO (1) the small quantities produced, we have not observed any spectral features that can be related to these species.However, it is to be expected that by consecutive reaction with H 2 , CO formed by eqs 1 and 2 can be converted to e.g.CH 4 . Besides the isotopically labeled experiments, it was also demonstrated by prolonged exposure to UV-irradiation in the presence of water vapor that eq 2 plays a major role in the formation of CO over Cu(I)/TiO 2 .In a way it is surprising that adding additional coke did not lead to extensive formation of CO.Apparently the surface coverage achieved was that considerable that the surface had become highly hydrophobic.This limits the reactive adsorption of CO 2 and, more importantly, significantly decreases the extent of surface hydration, as witnessed by the smaller intensity of the negative water bands in the 1620-1680 cm -1 region (Figure 8a).Clearly this is detrimental to the production of CO.Furthermore, the coke layer might simply prevent efficient light activation of the catalyst by absorption of light by the carbon layer, as was observed e.g. by Xia et al. 27 The surface chemistry of Cu(I)/TiO 2 in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction is discussed in more detail in the following. Surface Carbonate Chemistry.The Cu(I)/TiO 2 catalyst is very reactive toward CO 2 and CO at room temperature, leading to various carboxylate, bicarbonate, and carbonate species.Generally IR intensities are higher upon exposure to CO 2 .When CO 2 approaches Cu(I)/TiO 2 , carbonate species likely form on titania sites which are not fully coordinated, i.e. in the vicinity of the Cu(I) centers.This is in agreement with a study of Rasko et al., who investigated CO 2 adsorption and photocatalytic decomposition over prereduced Rh/TiO 2 . 16,17It was demonstrated in their study that, on prereduced Rh/TiO 2 , oxygen vacancies in the vicinity of Rh offered sites for carboxylate formation, specifically with a C atom of CO 2 linked to Rh and one O atom of CO 2 bonded to the oxygen vacancy of titania.It is generally accepted that, by illumination with light of sufficient energy, electron-hole pairs are generated in titania.Rasko et al. propose that electrons are transferred to CO 2 , yielding CO, while holes are involved in neutralizing the Ti 3 sites to Ti 4 .It is thus proposed by Rasko et al. that bent adsorbed CO 2 species are the precursor of CO, with the oxygen atom being incorporated in the TiO 2 , changing the oxidation state from Ti 3 to Ti 4 .Also in our study we observe a depletion of the 1650 and 1220 cm -1 bands upon illumination, suggesting that these might be involved in the formation of CO by CO 2 dissociation.However, rather than being incorporated in the Cu(I)/TiO 2 lattice, we believe the remaining oxygen is predominantly transferred to residual carbon, yielding an additional CO molecule, according to eq 1. The experiment conducted on a 13 CO 2 pretreated catalyst (Figure 3) demonstrates that, in addition to carboxylates/ bicarbonates, CO 2 induced surface carbonates are also unstable upon illumination, yielding 13 CO 2 .As previously discussed, the large selectivity for 12 CO in the experiment is related to water induced reactions of carbon residues, according to eq 2. This is followed by 12 CO adsorption on Cu(I) sites (2115 cm -1 ) and surface TiO 2 sites, yielding 12 CO induced carbonates, explaining the growth of the demonstrated features (at 1560, 1420, and 1350 cm -1 ) in Figure 3. It should be noted that the (bi)carbonate and carboxylate species formed are most likely a strong function of the extent of surface hydration of the applied TiO 2 catalysts.Morterra 28 has evaluated the interaction of CO with TiO 2 surfaces.He demonstrated that removal of water molecules and decomposition of surface hydroxyl groups (OH) lead to the formation of surface Lewis acid sites that reversibly chemisorb CO at ambient temperature.While Morterra removed water and hydroxyl groups by evacuation in a vacuum IR cell, it is obvious (Figure 3) that the degree of hydration is also largely affected by the illumination procedure. Artificial Photosynthesis, Fact or Fiction?Many (recent) studies discuss the performance of modified TiO 2 catalysts in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 . 29Generally methane and/ or methanol are the products reported to be formed.In view of our study, the data reported in various related studies should be interpreted with caution.Frei and co-workers already observed for mesoporous materials that carbon residues can be involved in the production of primary products in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 . 3031132 In view of our data, also for crystalline TiO 2 materials, water induced gasification of these carbon residues might be affecting the product quantities and distribution (reaction 2).This is particularly true if alkoxides (propoxide, butoxide) were used as the precursor 33 or if carbon supported TiO 2 was used. 27Also in the synthesis procedure of N-doped TiO 2 , organic solvents were used, the residue of which might have contributed to the observed activity. 34Clearly, contribution of these reactions leads to an overestimation of the rate of the real artificial photosynthesis reactions, such as 2CO 2 4H 2 O f 2CH 3 OH 3O 2 .It is highly recommended in future studies on photocatalytic CO 2 reactions to add a test of activity in the absence of CO 2 but in the presence of H 2 O to exclude the participation of catalyst associated carbon residues in the formation of products. While there is no doubt that carbon residues contribute to catalytic performance, based on our study we cannot entirely exclude artificial photosynthesis. 13CO was formed in various experiments, and it is necessary to isolate the reversed Boudouard reaction from true artificial photosynthesis.This would require careful evaluation of the production of O 2 .To close the oxygen balance is however extremely difficult, and usually irreproducible data are obtained due to fluctuations in background oxygen pressures.The most conclusive evidence that CO is formed in the absence of carbon residues is again provided by Frei and co-workers 18 in a high vacuum IR cell, in the case of isolated Ti sites in mesoporous materials.Ozonation was a very efficient way of removing residual carbon in their study.The onward CO 2 reduction performed under 13 CO 2 and H 2 O showed merely 13 CO production, which is significant evidence for true artificial photosynthesis.However, mechanistic studies on highly pure crystalline metal oxide systems are needed to definitively prove that artificial photosynthesis over these materials is fact as well as to further reveal the chemical pathway of CO 2 reduction, including the complexity in the dynamics of surface carbonates."

    "content": "Carbon residues largely participate in the formation of CO over Cu-promoted crystalline TiO 2 catalysts, as demonstrated by the combined use of DRIFT spectroscopy and 13 C labeled CO 2 .These residues are formed during the catalyst synthesis procedures, often involving the use of Ti-alkoxides and organic solvents, such as polyethylene glycol (PEG).Removal of these residues by thermal activation in air is incomplete, while prolonged exposure to water vapor and UV-irradiation is more efficient.Coking of Cu(I)/TiO 2 showed that extensive carbon coverage of Cu(I)/TiO 2 diminishes CO formation during illumination in the presence of CO 2 .
