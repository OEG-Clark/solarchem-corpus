    "content": "In recent years, the development of efficient artificial photocatalysts for CO 2 reduction has attracted much attention; however, the product selectivity, catalyst stability and catalytic activity are far from the requirements for commercial consideration.Herein, we design and synthesis of ZnO nanorod arrayscarbon fiber (ZnO NACF) composites via an in situ controlled growth process.The as-prepared (ZnO NACF) composites exhibit exceedingly high activity and excellent selectivity in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 to CH 3 OH (the maximum CH 3 OH yield is 430.2 mol - g cat.1 for 3.0 h under UV light irradiation, which is 7.15 times as high as that on pure ZnO) as a result of the improved electron-hole pair separation rate on ZnO NACF interface, as well as high light harvesting effects derived from the NACF hierarchical structure."

    "content": "The CF was supplied by Shanxi institute of coal chemistry of Chinese academy of sciences (CF040811-3).Prior to use, 2 g raw CF were refluxed in 100 mL of HNO 3 (68 wt) for 12 h at 140 C in an oil bath to remove residual catalyst.The suspension was then washed with deionized water/ethanol and dried at 120 C for 12 h.Then, 2 mM, 40 mL NaOH ethanol solution and 12.5 mM, 40 mL Zn(CH 3 COO) 2 ethanol solution were mixed for 30 min under magnetic stirring.Then as-pretreated CF were immersed into the above seed solution for 30 min, and annealed at 150 C for 30 min for five times.Finally, 0.93 g Zn(NO 3 ) 2 A 6H 2 O and 0.450 g HMTA were dissolved in 300 mL of deionized water, and the solution was heated to 90 C in water bath kettle, then the as-annealed ZnO seedsCF were immersed into the above solution.To tune the degree of grown ZnO NR length, a series of samples with different immersed time were conducted, which were named as 15-ZnO NACF, 30-ZnO NACF, 60-ZnO NACF, 90-ZnO NACF, 120-ZnO NACF, respectively.The resulting products were washed with deionized water/ ethanol for several times and dried under vacuum condition. The CO 2 photocatalytic reduction measurement was conducted in a Pyrex photo-reactor with a volume of 400 mL (Fig. S1).The asobtained ZnO NACF powder (1.0 g) was evenly dispersed on a Teflon surface fixed in the middle of the photo-reactor.In order to tune the saturated water vapor pressure, 20 mL of deionized water was pour into the reactor.A UV lamp ( 14254 nm, 12 mW cm A 2 ) was placed in the middle of the photo-reactor.Before performing the reactions, the reactor was purged with CO 2 for 60 min and sealed at ambient pressure.The photo-reactor was then heated to 353 K by using a heating tape to generate gaseous water and the UV lamp was switched on to start the experiment.The reaction products collected in gas and liquid phase were analyzed every 30 min To quantify the gaseous product, the output gas was analyzed by gas chromatography (Shimadzu, GC-14C) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD).The liquid product was quantified by ion chromatography (Shimadzu SCL-10ASP) under the following conditions: Shimpack IC-A3 column (set at 40 C), a CCD-10 AVP detector, mobile phase of Tris/H 3 BO 3 /p-hydroxybenzoic acid (0.67/3.09/1.10,g L A 1 ) with a flow rate of 1.0 mL min A 1 .Control experiments were performed in the dark or without catalyst under the same experimental conditions, while no reduction product was detected in these conditions."

    "content": "The detailed composition, purity, and crystal structure of the as-obtained product is initially investigated using XRD measurement, as shown in Fig. 1 at 21424.2and 43.3, and the broad peak demonstrates that the carbon is somewhat amorphous, which owns many active sites in raw CF.After decorated by ZnO NRs, the new appeared diffraction peaks can be indexed to a pure hexagonal phase (space group: P63mc) ZnO with the lattice constants a 140.326 and c 140.522 nm, which are in good agreement with the literature values (JCPDS 36-1451).Furthermore, the unusual contrast intensities of (0002) peak in XRD pattern also hints at the preferential growth of the product.Then the morphology of ZnO products is identified by SEM measurement, the ZnO are primarily composed of 1.2 mm bundle-like NRs vertical to the CF substrate, as shown in Fig. 1(b).The TEM image in Fig. 1(c) demonstrates the diameter of the NR ranges from 40 (bottom) to 25 nm (top).The typical HRTEM image reveals the NR is structurally uniform with a clear interplanar spacing of 2.606 A, which corresponds to exposed hexagonal ZnO (0002) plane and grows mainly along c axle. The growth mechanism of ZnO NACF is as follows: due to the character of C atom sp 2 hybridization, the atoms on CF surface are usually somewhat negative, and metal Zn 2 ions tend to absorb on the substrate's surface.On one hand, it should be paid to the fact that ZnO is a typical polar crystal material, which shows a basal (pedion) polar oxygen plane (000 1), a top tetrahedron corner-exposed polar zinc (0001) face, and low-index faces (vertical to the c axis) consisting of a nonpolar (1000) face 26.This process also favors the formation of 1D NA, especially for anisotropic growing properties with the uniform seeds on the substrate, as shown in Fig. 2(a) and (b).Furthermore, on prolonging the reaction time, an increasing number of ZnO nuclei landed on the surface of the ZnO NA.However, there is no space for spreading of redundant ZnO nuclei because the CF is occupied by NA.Therefore, ZnO nuclei in the droplets undergo a spontaneous preferential growth on the surface of the as-prepared NA, as shown in Fig. 2 (c) and (d).Additionally, the immersed reaction process is also tracked by UV/Vis absorption spectra, as shown in Fig. 3(a). The UV/Vis spectra exhibit strong absorptions from an initial wavelength of 364-372 nm with the reaction time prolonged from 5 min to 120 min, which result from the electronic transition from ZnO ground state to the excited state by UV light absorption 27,28.According to literature reports, 29 the red shift of the absorption edge is related to the growth of nanocrystal size, which is also proved by above SEM images (Fig. 2) and depicted in Fig. 3 (a) inset.Our similar consequences in the UV/Vis absorption spectra indicate that the growth process of the ZnO nuclei accompanies the increasing length of the ZnO NR and the grown nanostructure exhibit good uniform crystallization and structural features. In addition, their porous nature is also proved by BJH measurements, and the favorable specific surface area is called upon to accommodate a large amount of superficially active sites to participate in photocatalysis evolution reactions.As showed in Fig. 3 (b), typical Langmuir type III characteristic isotherms accompanied by hysteresis loops are observed in all the samples.The BET adsorption analysis shows that the specific surface area of 30-ZnO NACF is 120.47 m 2 g A 1 , which is higher than the other products.The high specific area can facilitate the diffusion and adsorption of reactant molecules, resulting in a more efficient catalytic process, and their photocatalytic CO 2 evolution measurements are conducted as follows. As shown in Fig. 4(a), pure ZnO shows relatively low CO 2 photocatalytic production yield (60.2 mol - g cat. 1 for 3.0 h).In contrast, in the presence of CF, the ZnO NRCF composites exhibit obviously enhanced CO 2 photocatalytic production performance.And the enhancement of CO 2 evolution is attributed to the CF effectively dispersed ZnO NR with same growth orientation with excellent electronic conductivity, which promote the photogenerated electron transport into the surface of CF more easily and inhibit the recombination between photogenerated electron-hole pairs 30.Furthermore, the introduction of CF with high surface area also increases the amount of exposed photocatalytic active sites.The photocatalytic activity is maximized at the optimal ZnO NR length in the composite, and the CH 3 OH amount yield of 30-ZnO NRCF sample enhance to 430.2 mol - g cat. 1 for 3.0 h, which is 7.15 times higher than that of pure ZnO.Additionally, the redox potentials for CO 2 reduction is close to that for the reduction of H 2 O to H 2 , the ZnO photocatalyst inevitably catalyze H 2 O to H 2 as well.Fig. 4(b) shows the time evolution of CH 3 OH yield for pure ZnO NR and ZnO NRCF composites under UV irradiation.As the content of carbon materials and ZnO NR has a significant effect on the absorption of photons, with an increase in the content of ZnO amount, absorbed photons would reach the maximum.Then, the photons cannot be continually injected into photocatalysts, which leads to excess recombination of electrons and holes.In addition, excess ZnO covered on photocatalysts' surface (as shown in Fig. 2 (d)) would block the light penetration, consequently decreasing the photocatalytic activity.These factors are compromised with each other upon 30-ZnO NRCF sample, at which the screening of functional sites counterbalances the ZnO NR coverage condition, which agree with the BET results. Furthermore, to investigate the photo-stability of ZnO NRCF, recycling experiments are also carried out.As shown in Fig. 4(c), after 10 times of consecutive recycling, the catalyst ability exhibits a slight decline, which is due to corroded and aggregated ZnO NRs after consecutive recycling photocatalysis.Based on the above results, a mechanism for efficient electron-hole separation as well as the light harvesting of ZnO NACF composites is proposed as follows in Fig. 4(d).ZnO NRs coated on CF not only possess a large surface area, which is beneficial for the diffusion and mass transportation of CO 2 molecules and H ions and harvest more solar energy due to the efficient light scattering in the photochemical reduction.As shown in Fig. 4(d) inset, the light may experience multiple scattering between the NRs and the CF substrate when passing through the free space between NRs, thereby leading to efficient light harvesting.Owing to the interaction between ZnO nanocrystal and CF, the electrons from ZnO can easily transfer to the surface of CF and delay the recombination of electron-hole pairs.Holes in the valence band of ZnO react with water to produce O 2 and H and absorbed CO 2 molecules are reduced to methanol by enriched electrons on the CF surface.During the reduction process, the major reaction steps are described briefly as follows: ( ) ( )"

    "content": "In summary, ZnO NA was uniformly decorated on the CF through an in situ controlled growth process and subsequently hydrothermal treatment in this paper.The photocatalytic results proved that hierarchical ZnO NACF composites showed much higher CH 3 OH evolution performance than the individual ZnO NRs due to the synergistic effect of catalytic active sites and light utilization.This work not only provides a facile approach to construct high photo-catalytically active composites with a high yield, but also puts forward a method to reduce the amount of the greenhouse gas CO 2 in the atmosphere into desirable industrial materials.
