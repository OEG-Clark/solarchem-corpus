    "content": "A series of metal-organic frameworks isoreticular to MIL-125-NH 2 were prepared, where the 2-amino-terephthalate organic links feature N-alkyl groups of increasing chain length (from methyl to heptyl) and varying connectivity (primary and secondary).The prepared materials display reduced optical bandgaps correlated to the inductive donor ability of the alkyl substituent as well as high photocatalytic activity towards the reduction of carbon dioxide under blue illumination operating over 120 h.Secondary N-alkyl substitution (isopropyl, cyclopentyl and cyclohexyl) exhibit larger apparent quantum yields than the primary N-alkyl analogs directly related to their longer lived excited-state lifetime.In particular, MIL-125-NHCyp (Cyp cyclopentyl) exhibits a small bandgap (E g 2.30 eV), a long-lived excited-state (s 68.8 ns) and the larger apparent quantum yield ( app 1.80) compared to the parent MIL-125-NH 2 (E g 2.56 eV, app 0.31, s 12.8 ns), making it a promising candidate for the next generation of photocatalysts for solar fuel production based on earth-abundant elements."

The alkylated diester 1a-f (0.50 g) was dissolved in THF (25 mL), followed by addition of 1 M NaOH (aq, 12.8 mL).The solution was heated to 70 oC and stirred for 8 h.The mixture was concentrated in a rotary evaporator at 45 oC to remove the excess THF.The mixture was cooled to room temperature followed by addition of 1 M HCl (aq) until a pH 3.The observed precipitate was isolated by filtration, rinsed with water, and dried in air at room temperature for 6 h. Compounds 2a-f (0.41 mmol) were placed in 20 mL scintillation vials with anhydrous DMF (4.90 mL) and anhydrous MeOH (0.35 mL).The mixture was mixed thoroughly by immersing the vial in an ultra-sonic bath for 1 min then transferred into a borosilicate glass tube (see SI for more details) and bubbled with N 2 (g) for 5 min.Ti(O i Pr) 4 (0.031 mL, 0.106 mmol) was added to the tube via syringe, immediately flash frozen in liquid N 2 , and flame sealed as described in the SI.The sealed tube was heated to 150 oC for 48 h.After cooling to room temperature, the formed powder was isolated by filtration and rinsed with DMF (3) and CHCl 3 (3).The powder was immersed in CHCl 3 and stored for 3 d in a desiccator, replacing the solvent during this time (8).The solvent was removed by decantation and the solvent-wet powder was dried under dynamic vacuum (10 mtorr) for 48 h at room temperature.The degassed yellow solid was stored under N 2 in a desiccator. Blue LED photochemical reactor setup and calibration.Photocatalytic reactions were carried out in a home-built reactor using a 60 W blue LED strip (5 m long, MEILI, product CNMX-Hardlines-464321) with 466 nm (fwhm 20 nm), the strip was coiled and glued inside a 20 cm diameter tin can and mounted on top of a magnetic stirrer.The temperature inside the photo reactor was kept at 25 oC with the aid of an attached fan and a thermometer.The photon flux of the photoreactor was determined using iron oxalate actinometry at 466 nm following the protocol by Parker et al. 24 obtaining a volumetric photon flux of R o, 1.92 10 -3 mol (photons) L -1 h -1 .The apparent quantum yield, app (also named photonic efficiency) was determined according to the IUPAC recommended protocol by Serpone et al. 25 using the formula: where R in corresponds to the initial rate of the reaction (see below), and R o, is the volumetric photon flux. Photochemical reduction of carbon dioxide to formate were performed under ambient conditions in the photoreactor described above.MIL-125-NHR (3 -5 mg) was loaded in a 3 mL borosilicate vial with a magnetic stirrer.1.5 mL of a CO 2 -bubbled stock solution containing triethanolamine (TEOA, 0.30 mol L -1 ) and mesitylene (1.5 mmol L -1 ) in MeCN-d 3 was added to the vial and tightly capped with a PTFE/rubber septum.A flow of CO 2 (g) was bubbled into the vial with the aid of a needle with an input positive pressure of 1 psi for 30 min previous to photoirradiation.During irradiation, 40 L aliquots were sampled every 12 h with the aid of a syringe, the aliquot was filtered through a 0.2 m PTFE syringe membrane into an NMR tube.The filtrate was diluted with CDCl 3 (0.6 mL) and a total of 256 transients were measured for each time point.Kinetic plots were obtained in both concentration and turnover number in the ordinate axis.The concentration was obtained by addition of the intensity of the photoreduced-CO 2 signals (formate HEF BHEF) and normalizing with respect to the internal standard, and the turnover number was determined as the total number of moles of photoreduced-CO 2 (mol CO 2 mol HEF mol BHEF) per mol of photocatalyst (with respect to the organic linker).The initial rate of the reaction was obtained by fitting a third order polynomial function using linear least squares then evaluating their first derivative at t 0."

    "content": "The isoreticular family of MOFs was prepared via S N 2 reaction of 2-amino terephthalate dimethyl ester (Scheme 1) with the corresponding alkyl iodide in basic conditions forming intermediates 1a-d and 1g in moderate yields.Intermediates 1e-f were synthesized via reductive amination with cyclopentanone or cyclohexanone in the presence of NaBH 4 /TMSCl in cold DMF in high yields.Hydrolysis of the dimethyl esters in NaOH/THF afforded linkers 2a-g, and solvothermal MOF crystallization with Ti(O i Pr) 4 in DMF/MeOH in flame sealed borosilicate tubes produced the desired MOFs in high yields (See SI).The molecular integrity of the linkers within the MOFs was determined using 1 H NMR by dissolving the synthesized MOFs in NaOD 0.1 M in D 2 O (Figure S1).These measurements allowed identifying any loss of alkyl chains at the Nsubstitution, as it has been observed by others 26 that solvothermal conditions using tetravalent early transition metal ions (such as Zr 4 ) in DMF can induce dealkylations at the N-substitution.No loss of N-alkyl chains was observed in any of the prepared MOFs, indicating a robust and clean crystallization.Attempts to prepare a double methylated aminoterephthalate MIL-125-NMe 2 using linker 3 were unsuccessful (Scheme 2) due to the decomposition of the linker into the monomethylated species 2a, with 80 conversion while forming non-porous amorphous solids.We deduced that the steric constrain imposed by the double substitution impedes the crystallization of the MOF, while Ti 4 induces N-dealkylation, similar to Zr-based MOFs, and thus only single Nalkylated MOFs were successfully synthesized. The MOFs were obtained as microcrystalline powders that were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) crystallography.SEM images (Figures S10-S17) displayed samples with uniform particle shape and texture, suggesting homogeneous materials.All the materials display sharp diffraction peaks (Figure 2) starting at 6.8o 2, evidencing high degree of crystallinity with large unit cells, as expected in a MOF.All patterns were indexed by comparison to the simulated pattern of MIL-125-NH 2 , 17 suggesting the formation of frameworks that are Determination of the differential enthalpy of adsorption (Figure 4b) allows understanding the thermodynamic interactions between CO 2 and the MOFs.We observed no particular trend given by the systematic N-alkyl substitution across the uptake ranges, with all MOFs observing similar than MIL-125-NH 2 , ranging from -20 kJ mol -1 (MIL-125-NHEt) to -27 kJ mol -1 (MIL-125-NHMe) when loading 1 CO 2 molecule per unit cell.This lack on trend in adsorption enthalpy evidences the convoluted effect of: 1) the inherent porosity of the parent MIL-125 framework, 2) the electron rich nature of the amino nitrogen lone pair acting as a Lewis basic site, and 3) the steric hindrance imposed by the bulky alkyl substituents.While the enthalpy of adsorption is a combination of all these effects, the undiluted electronic effects are better understood by determination of the bandgap of the MOFs.The UV-visible absorption spectra for crystalline powder of the MIL-125-NHR series were acquired using an integrating sphere and the results can be seen in Figure 4a. The parent MIL-125-NH 2 exhibits a low energy absorption peak at 375 nm.As expected, a gradual redshift in the absorption is observed for the alkylated derivatives; presumably the shift can be attributed to the alkyl donor group destabilizing the top of the valence band (HOMO) of the amino terephthalate linker.Application of the Tauc model to the photoabsorption plots (Figures S57-S64) allowed for the determination of the optical bandgap (or HOMO-LUMO gap).A decrease in the bandgap of the materials is observed (Figure 4b) from MIL-125-NH 2 (E g 2.56 eV) to MIL-125-NHCy (E g 2.29 eV) in a stepwise mode with increased alkyl chain substitution, as expected from the inductive effects of the corresponding alkyl chain.Of the series, the n-heptyl substituted MOF displayed a larger bandgap than the cyclopentyl and cyclohexyl, and close in value to nbutyl substituted MOF.This behavior is due to the linear nature of the heptyl chain. Inductive effects decrease exponentially as the C-C -bonds are further away from the heteroatom, expecting very little induction beyond the fourth -bond, as observed in MIL-125-NHBu and MIL-125-NHhep.In contrast, cyclic substituents retain the -bonds in close proximity to the amine group, resulting in stronger electronic induction and therefore lower bandgaps.We expect that tertiary carbon substitutions (e.g., tert-butyl), or N,N-dialkyls (e.g.MIL-125-NMe 2 ) would result in even lower bandgaps. The photocatalytic rates and efficiencies of MIL-125-NHR MOFs are known to be dependent on the lifetime of the photo generated charge-separated state. 18To gain insights into the excited state dynamics, nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy was performed on suspensions of selected MIL-125-NHR in MeCN and the results can be seen in Figure 4c and Figures S66-S69.Upon excitation at 405 nm the parent material, MIL-125-NH 2 , exhibits bleach from 390 nm to 530 nm and positive A features at 390 nm and 530 nm (Figure S65).These transient spectroscopic features are the electron on the titanium-oxo cluster. 18,27Similarly, absorption features are observed for the alkylated derivatives with example spectra for MIL-125-NHMe shown in Figure 4c and all other spectra in supporting information.As was observed with the ground state absorption, the alkylated complexes A features are red shifted by 30 nm compared to MIL-125-NH 2 .The lifetime of the charge-separated state for the measured set of MIL-125-NHR materials was monitored at 500 nm ( ex 405 nm) and the results can be seen in Figure 4d We explored the photocatalytic activity of the isoreticular MOFs towards CO 2 photoreduction using blue irradiation (Scheme 3).A LED light source was utilized because of its accessibility, low cost, high irradiance, low power needs and narrow emission profile, compared to Xe-based lamps. 28Moreover, using a narrow band aids in circumventing photocatalysis by any residual titanium oxide formed during the MOF synthesis, as these phases require light in the UV region ( 350 nm). 3 Irradiating MIL-125-NHR suspensions in MeCN-d 3 under a flow of CO 2 and in the presence of blue light ( 466 nm) resulted in the formation of formate as the product of CO 2 reduction, which displays a 1 H NMR signal at 8.45 ppm (Figure 5).Two other signals were also observed at 8.08 and 8.04 ppm, which correspond to N-(2hydroxyethyl)formamide (HEF) and N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)formamide (BHEF), respectively (Figure S73).These two species appear as result of formate reacting with the hydrolyzed products of oxidized TEOA (Scheme 3), as the photoreduction operates in non-anhydrous conditions. 29Integration of the NMR signals and normalization with respect to the mesitylene internal standard provided kinetic plots (Figures S74-S81) for the three CO 2 -photoreduced species.Figure 6a 0.136 mmol L -1 at t 10 h), 17 resulting in very similar values, providing a validation to our approach.Fitting polynomial functions to the concentration-based kinetic plot, followed by evaluation at t 0 h of their first derivative, allowed us to obtain the initial rate of the photoreduction.The initial rates for all the MOFs were utilized to obtain an apparent quantum yield ( app , also referred as photonic efficiency 25 ) using eq.(2).In this work we use the term apparent quantum yield for two reasons: first, the ratio of light absorption/scattering by the MOF is not accounted for (i.e.we assume complete light absorption), and second, because the kinetic plots account for two side reactions (amide formation) that occur after the photocatalytic step.As shown in Figure 6b, secondary Nalkyls, isopropyl, cyclopentyl, and cyclohexyl (Figure 6b blue histograms) display a larger app (1.5 -1.8) than the primary N-alkyls (0.30 -0.40, Figure 6b orange histograms); especially MIL-125-NHCyp, which displayed the largest apparent quantum yield app 1.80.The increased catalytic activity is consistent with the increased excited-state lifetime and decreased bandgap for the secondary alkyl substituent species. It is noteworthy to emphasize that we observed no trend or correlation observed between the photocatalytic rates/efficiency and the gas adsorption properties of the MOFs.We believe that electronic effects from N-alkyl substitution determine the photocatalytic efficiency with little effect from mass transport.This assessment is consistent with the reaction mechanism proposed by Fu et al., 17 who propose that upon photoexcitation, an electron is promoted from the -cloud in terephthalate to a Ti d-state and is further transferred to CO 2 , reducing it to formate.The MOF catalyst is then regenerated by oxidizing TEOA (the latter also serving as proton source).Our observed correlation between excited-state lifetime and apparent quantum yield suggest that the rate-limiting step of the reduction is the electron transfer from Ti 3 to CO 2 competing with charge recombination of the MOF.The chemical stability of the MIL-125-NHR MOFs was assessed by PXRD and 1 H NMR after 120 h of photoreaction.No changes in the PXRD patterns were observed, suggesting stability of the crystalline framework (Figure S9).Moreover, only marginal linker decomposition was observed in the 1 H NMR spectra of the base-digested MOFs.The reusability of the MOF photocatalysts was assessed by re-exposing MIL-125-NHCyp for a second photocatalytic run for another 120 h, observing less than 5 variation in concentration of reduced CO 2 species, indicating photochemical stability after reuse (Figure S83).Future work includes studying the effect of other reductants (e.g.alcohols, hydrogen) and more complex substitutions, such as including tertiary N-alkyls and -donors that will increase the lifetime of the excited state also induce smaller bandgaps."

    "content": "We prepared an isoreticular series of titanium-based MOF photocatalysts by increasing the N-alkyl substitution in MIL-125-NHR, where R varies from methyl, to ethyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, and n-heptyl.The isoreticular nature of their crystal structure was studied by powder X-ray crystallography and gas adsorption.Their photophysical and photocatalytic properties were studied displaying a gradual decrease in the optical bandgap from 2.56 eV in MIL-125-NH 2 to 2.29 eV in MIL-125-NHCy, consistent with increased electron density around the organic linker via inductive effects of the N-alkyl chain.We explored the photocatalytic efficiency of the MOFs towards reduction of carbon dioxide under blue LED light, displaying increased reaction rates and quantum yields consistent with the increased alkyl substitution.We observed that the CO 2 photoreduction quantum yield is higher for MOFs with increased excited-state lifetime, particularly with secondary N-alkyls substituents, and concluded that from the current proposed mechanism, the electron transfer from Ti 3 to CO 2 is the rate-limiting step in the photoreduction.This study allowed us to understand how small variations in the organic linker of the MOF can result in tuning of the photophysical and photocatalytic properties of the materials, solely by selection of specific substituents in the organic links.

(a) CO 2 gas adsorption isotherms (273 K) and (b) Differential (or isosteric) . The lack of signal rise time indicates that the charge-separated state is generated within the instrument response time ( 10 ns).The charge-separated lifetime increases in the order of MIL-125-NH 2 (s 12.8 ns) MIL-125-NHMe (s 38.2 ns) MIL-125-NHBu (s 52.1 ns) MIL-125-NHEt (s 60.63 ns) MIL-125-NHCyp (s 68.9 ns) MIL-125-NHCyp (s 68.8 ns) MIL-125-NHhep (s 69.2 ns) MIL-125-NH i Pr (s 75.11 ns) MIL-125-NHCy (s 91.35 ns) generally corresponding to a trend of longer lifetimes with greater donor ability of the alkyl substituent.Presumably, the enhanced stabilization of the oxidized terephthalate by the secondary alkyl chain is responsible for the long lifetime observed for MIL-125-NH i Pr, MIL-125-NHCyp and MIL-125-NHCy.
