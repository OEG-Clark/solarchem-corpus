    "content": "The design of Cu 2 O-tipped ZnO nanorods is proposed here aiming at enhanced photoelectrochemical properties.The tip-selective deposition of Cu 2 O is confirmed by scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM).The photoinduced charge behavior like charge generation, separation and transport has been thoroughly studied by UV-vis absorption analysis and different photoelectrochemical characterizations, including transient photocurrent, incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS), and Mott-Schottky measurements.The photoelectrochemical characterizations clearly indicate that ZnO/Cu 2 O structures exhibit much higher performance than pristine ZnO, due to the formation of p-n junction, as well as the tip selective growth of Cu 2 O on ZnO.Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction in aqueous solution under UV-visible light illumination shows that CO is the main product, and with the increase of the Cu 2 O content in the heterostructure, the CO yield increases.This work shows that Cu 2 O-tipped ZnO nanorods possess improved behavior of charge generation, separation and transport, which may work as a potential candidate for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction."

    "content": "All the chemicals used in this work including zinc nitrate (Zn(NO 3 )6H 2 O, 99.9), copper sulfate (CuSO 4 , 99.9), potassium chloride (KCl, 99.9), sodium hydroxide (NaOH, 99.9) and lactic acid (C 3 H 6 O 3 , 99.9) were purchased from Sinogrham Chemicals.The chemicals were of analytical grade and used without any further purification.FTO (Fluorine-doped tin oxide) glass (14 sq -1 ) was bought from Wuhan Jinge Solar Energy Technology Co., Ltd, China.The Milli-Q water was used throughout the experiments. The ZnO nanorods were prepared by electrochemical deposition method using an aqueous solution composed of 1 mmolL -1 Zn(NO 3 )6H 2 O and 0.1 molL -1 KCl.The FTO substrate was used as the working electrode, platinum as the counter electrode, and saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode.The electrodeposition was carried out under the bias of -1.045 V for 150 min at a temperature of 70 C.Finally, the as-prepared ZnO nanorods were rinsed thoroughly with Milli-Q water to remove the residuals. The ZnO nanorods with Cu 2 O at the tips were synthesized via photochemical deposition.The aqueous solution with 1 mmolL -1 CuSO 4 and 5 methanol was prepared as the precursor, of which the pH value was adjusted to 9.0 by NaOH.The lactic acid was used as stabilizer to avoid precipitation.The as-prepared ZnO nanorods were immersed into the above solution for Cu 2 O photodeposition.Before the deposition, the solution was deaerated by Ar gas for 30 min in dark, and then it was illuminated with a 300 W Xe lamp (PLS-SXE300, 470 mWcm -2 ) for 30, 45 and 60 s, respectively. The as-synthesized samples were then rinsed with Milli-Q water and pure ethanol, and finally vacuum dried at 60 oC.In this work, the ZnO/Cu 2 O heterostructures prepared under different illumination times are respectively denoted as ZnO/Cu 2 O-30s, ZnO/Cu 2 O-45s, and ZnO/Cu 2 O-60s. The crystallinity of the obtained samples was investigated by X-ray diffractometer with Cu K radiation (D8 Focus, Bruker, Germany).Chemical compositions of the samples were analysed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis (Physical electronic PHI5000).The morphology and structure of the materials were studied by the scanning electron microscopy (SEM, S4800, Hitachi, Japan) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Tecnai G2 F20 U-TWIN, FEI, USA).UV-vis absorption spectra were collected using a UV/Vis/NIR spectrophotometer (Lambda 750, Perkin Elmer, USA). Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was acquired on an FTIR spectrophotometer (Spectrum One, Perkin Elmer, USA). The photoelectrochemical performance was tested in a three-electrode configuration with the as-prepared nanostructure as working electrode, Pt as counter electrode and SCE as reference electrode.All electrochemical measurements were carried out in CO 2 saturated 0.1 molL -1 KHCO 3 (pH was performed on the electrochemical workstation (CHI 660D, Chenhua, China) under the irradiation of Xe lamp (120 mWcm -2 ).The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) was obtained on the electrochemical workstation (IM6, Zahner, Germany) with a tunable light source (TLS 03, Zahner, Germany).The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and controlled intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) were implemented using an electrochemical workstation (IM6, Zahner, Germany) under UV-visible light (100 mWcm -2 , WLC02, Zahner, Germany).The EIS measurements were carried out from 4 MHz to 1 mHz with an AC amplitude of of 0.20.9V (vs.RHE) on the electrochemical workstation (IM6, Zahner, Germany). The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 was performed under both visible and UV-visible light irradiation in a gas-closed circulation system at 15 oC and a pressure of 2830 kPa.The 0.25 molL -1 Na 2 SO 3 and 1 molL -1 NaOH aqueous solution were used for the CO 2 photoreduction reaction.The electrodes of ZnO or ZnO/Cu 2 O heterostructures were placed in the solution and kept in upward direction.The system was purged with CO 2 for 90 min in dark to obtain maximum adsorption of CO 2 molecules on the active sites of the samples.Then a 300-W Xe lamp (PLS-SXE300) was used to illuminate on the electrodes surface.A 420-nm cut-off filter was used to achieve the visible-light illumination.The identification of the products was valued by a gas chromatography system (GC, 7890A, Agilent, USA) equipped with flame ionization detector (FID) and thermal conductivity detector (TCD), which was directly connected with the photochemical reaction system.The product yield was evaluated every one hour for totally 8 h in series.In-depth analysis on the structure of ZnO and ZnO/Cu 2 O-60s was further carried out by TEM and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM).The length of the ZnO nanorods is 800 nm (Figure 3a).ZnO (0002) fringe is perpendicular to the rod axis with a lattice spacing of 0.26 nm on average (Figure 3b), indicating that ZnO nanorods grow along the 0001 direction as also confirmed by the XRD analysis.The selected area electron diffraction (SEAD) result further proves that the as-prepared ZnO nanorod is single crystalline (Figure 3c).3e).The SEAD of the heterostructure indicates that the Cu 2 O is polycrystalline (Figure 3f), indicating that the photodeposited Cu 2 O has high crystallinity and constructed by small particles, as also observed in the zoom-in SEM image (inset of Figure 2b).To further investigate the growth sites of the Cu 2 O particles, STEM imaging was carried out (Figure 3g).The Cu element mapping reveals that Cu only distributes on the tip of the ZnO nanorod, confirming the tip-selective deposition of the Cu 2 O particles."

    "content": "On the basis of the above analysis, the photodeposition growth mechanism of Cu 2 O on the tips of the ZnO nanorods is proposed as shown in Scheme 1. In order to evaluate the properties of the as-prepared samples, including photoinduced charge generation, separation and transport, the optical and photoelectrochemical measurements were carried out under OCP.The charge generation performance was investigated by the UV-vis absorption spectra as shown in Figure 4.The ZnO nanorods show strong light absorption ability in the wavelength range less than 375 nm.Its corresponding bandgap is determined to be 3.28 eV according to Equation 1 (inset of Figure 4), where is the absorption coefficient, h is the photon energy, A is a constant and Eg is the bandgap of the material under test.26 h h - For all the ZnO/Cu The corresponding results are shown in Table 1.The thickness of the depletion layer is of several submicrometer order, which is much larger than the Cu 2 O particle size.Thus, the depletion region extends throughout the entire Cu 2 O particles on the tips of the ZnO nanorods, similar to the case of anodic polarization, in which the electrons can be impeded to diffuse into the electrolyte.31 As a result, the flat band potential shifts positively, facilitating charge separation at more anodic bias.32 Based on the previous studies, ZnO and Cu 2 O form a staggered heterojunction.33,34 which is in favor of the enhancement of photocurrent. Here the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 under visible and UV-visible light irradiation over the as-synthesized samples is used as the example for the photocatalytic applications.Since lactic acid is used during the synthesis, FTIR is conducted to investigate the existence of it so as not to be confused with the carbon source in the CO 2 reduction.The peak at 511 cm -1 can be identified as the stretching mode of Zn-O, 35,36 and the peak at 626 cm -1 is attributed to the Cu-O stretching vibration in Cu 2 O 37,38 (Figure S2).Clearly no other impurity peaks can be observed in the FTIR spectra, indicating the successful removal of lactic acid. CO is detected as the major product from the photoreduction of CO 2 over all the samples under UV-visible light illumination (Figure 6).Though the detailed mechanism is still not clear, here it is suggested that the formation of CO may follow the carbene pathway.As mentioned above, the photogenerated electrons accumulate in the conduction band of ZnO.The initial photoreduction step is the activation of CO 2 on the catalyst surface to form the surface-bound metastable radical anion of CO 2 -through the reduction by the photogenerated electrons, followed by further reduction with one more electron to form the CO. It is noted that the ZnO/Cu However, no products can be detected for all the samples under visible-light illumination either for the pristine ZnO or the ZnO/Cu 2 O heterostructures.This is in accordance with the transient photocurrent results (Figures 5a and5b), in which the value of photocurrent under UV-visible light illumination is hundreds of times higher than that under visible light.In this case, the product amount of CO 2 photocatalytic reduction under visible light is too low, which is beyond the detection limit of GC, possibly because the amount of Cu 2 O is not high enough."

Compared to the ZnO nanorods, the photocatalytic activity is enhanced when the Cu 2 O content is increased, such as over the ZnO/Cu 2 O-45s catalyst.The CO amount further increases over the ZnO/Cu 2 O-60s sample, in that more Cu 2 O means higher efficiency for the generation, separation and transport of charge carriers, as confirmed by the above photoelectrochemical analysis.Moreover, the Cu 2 O-tipped ZnO nanorods can provide a large contact area between the ZnO and carbon source in the electrolyte, promoting the unidirectional transfer of holes to the Cu 2 O tip and electrons confined within the ZnO nanorods.
