    "content": "For efficient solar energy conversion, the morphology engineering of hollow graphitic carbon nitride (g-C 3 N 4 ) is one of the promising approachs benefiting from abundant exposed active sites and short photocarrier transport distances, but is difficult to control on account of easy structural collapse.Herein, a facile supramolecular electrostatic self-assembly strategy has been developed for the first time to fabricate mesoporous thin-walled g-C 3 N 4 microtubes (mtw-CNT) with shell thickness of ca. 13 nm.The morphological control of g-C 3 N 4 enhances specific surface area by 12 times, induces stronger optical absorption, widens bandgap by 0.18 eV, improves photocurrent density by 2.5 times, and prolongs lifetimes of charge carriers from bulk to surface, compared with those of bulk g-C 3 N 4 .As a consequence, the transformed g-C 3 N 4 exhibits the optimum photocatalytic H 2 -production rate of 3.99 mmol h -1 g -1 ( 420 nm) with remarkable apparent quantum efficiency of 8.7 ( 420 15 nm) and long-term stability.Moreover, mtw-CNT also achieves high photocatalytic CO 2 -to-CO selectivity of 96 ( 420 nm), much better than those on the most previously reported porous g-C 3 N 4 photocatalysts prepared by the conventional hard-templating and soft-templating methods."

Preparation of bulk g-C 3 N 4 (b-CN) : Bulk g-C 3 N 4 was prepared by heating melamine at 823 K for 4 h with a ramping rate of 2 K min -1 under argon atmosphere (99.99,50 mL min -1 ) and cooled down to room temperature naturally. Preparation of NCP : Melamine (24 mmol) was added with water (80 mL) in a 100 mL beaker.The suspension was stirred at 353 K for 1 h, and the pH value of the solution reached ca .10.The solution was then transferred to a hydrothermal reactor and treated at 453 K for 24 h.After cooling to room temperature, the solution was centrifuged at 10,0 0 0 rpm for 5 min, and the supernatant liquid was diluted into a 500 mL volumetric flask.The concentration of the supernatant solution is calibrated to be 0.056 mol L -1 . Preparation of PCP : In a 100 mL beaker, melamine (24 mmol) was added with water (80 mL).The solution was stirred at 353 K for 1 h and kept at pH 1 by adding with hydrochloric acid solution (1 M).The solution was then treated with the same procedures to those of the NCP.The concentration of the supernatant solution is calibrated to be 0.048 mol L -1 . Fabrication of mtw-CNT : In a typical synthesis, the PCP supernatant (200 mL) was placed in a 333 K water bath.The NCP supernatant (200 mL) was transferred to a funnel and quickly dropped (3 mL s -1 ) into the PCP supernatant.The solution was aged at 333 K for 24 h, and then centrifuged at 10,0 0 0 rpm for 5 min.A white precipitate was collected and washed with deionized water by several cycles of centrifugal separation/washing/redispersion until the chloride ion concentration in the filtrate is negligible, checked by AgNO 3 test.The product was dried at 383 K for 12 h and then transferred to a quartz tube at 823 K for 4 h with a ramping rate of 2 K min -1 , followed by naturally cooling to room temperature under argon atmosphere (99.99,50 mL min -1 ).The as-prepared g-C 3 N 4 is denoted as mtw-CNT 1.0 .Similarly, when the mole ratios of PCP to NCP are tuned to be 0.5:1 and 1.5:1, the assynthesized catalysts are denoted as mtw-CNT 0.5 and mtw-CNT 1.5 , respectively.Additionally, no product could be obtained after the direct heat-treatment of PCP at 823 K for 4 h under argon atmosphere. Preparation of mesoporous g-C 3 N 4 (mpg-CN) : mpg-CN was prepared according to the reported literature 19 .3 g of cyanamide was dissolved in 3.75 g of SiO 2 colloidal dispersion with stirring at 333 K overnight.The mixture was then heated at 823 K for 4 h.The resulting product was treated with 4 mol L -1 NH 4 HF 2 for 24 h to remove the silica template.The powder was then centrifuged and washed with deionized water and ethanol three times, respectively.Finally, the yellow powder was dried at 383 K in a vacuum oven overnight. Preparation of hollow g-C 3 N 4 by using cyanuric acid as a soft template (CM-CN) : CM-CN was synthesized referring to the previous study 24 .1.00 g of melamine and 1.02 g of cyanuric acid were dissolved in 100 mL of ethanol at 333 K for 24 h and dried at the same temperature.The obtained white powder was then calcined at 823 K with the identical thermal-treatment procedure mentioned above.Finally, the resulting product was washed by boiling water several times, and was dried at 383 K for 12 h. Thermogravimetric analysis (TG-DTG) was performed on a Shimadzu DTG-60H thermal analyzer at a heating rate of 10 K min -1 under nitrogen atmosphere (99.99, 20 mL min -1 ).Zeta potential analysis was examined by Powereach JS94J at room temperature.X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) measurements were carried out with Cu K radiation ( 1.54184A) on a Rigaku D/MAX-RB diffractometer.Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were recorded with FEI Quanta 400F and FEI Tecnai G2 F20 S-TWIN, respectively.The elemental mappings and chemical compositions were determined by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) equipped on SEM.Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were recorded with a Bruker Multimode 8 in tapping mode.The Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR) were recorded using a Thermo Scientific Nicolet iS10 FTIR spectrometer.X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was detected on a Thermo Fisher ESCALAB 250 photoelectron spectrometer at 3.0 10 -10 mbar with monochromatic Al K radiation ( E 1486.2eV).All binding energies were referenced to the C 1 s peak (284.6 eV) arising from the adventitious carbon.N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of samples were obtained using a Quantochrome autosorb iQ instrument at 77 K.The total pore volume was calculated with the Barret-Joyner-Halender (BJH) method using the desorption branch of the nitrogen isotherms.The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area was determined using adsorption data in the relative pressure ( P / P 0 ) range of 0.050.35.All the samples were degassed at 473 K for 3 h before N 2 adsorption-desorption measurement.UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were measured on a Shimadzu 2550 UV-vis spectrometer equipped with an integrating sphere diffuse reflectance accessory.Photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL) was conducted by an Edinburgh FLS-920 spectrometer at room temperature. All electrochemical measurements were performed on an electrochemical analyzer (Multi Autolab/M204) with a standard threeelectrode cell using an Ag/AgCl electrode (3 M KCl) and a Pt plate as reference electrode and counter electrode, respectively.The electrolyte was 0.2 M Na 2 SO 4 solution (pH 6.6) without additive and was purged with nitrogen gas for 2 h prior to the measurements.The visible light was generated by a CEL-HXF 300 W xenon lamp with a 420 nm cut-off filter.The working electrode was prepared was as follows: 50 mg of sample was dissolved in 5 mL N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) under sonication for 1 h to get a slurry.The slurry was uniformly spread onto glassy carbon electrode whose diameter is 5 mm, and was irradiated by IR light for 3 h.Then, nafion solution (0.05, 10 L) was droped onto the resulting electrode and air-dried for 1 h at ambient temperature.Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was recorded at a 5 mV sinusoidal AC perturbation over the frequency range of 0.110 5 Hz. Photocatalytic H 2 production was performed in a Pyrex topirradiation vessel connected to a glass-closed gas circulation and evacuation system (CEL-SPH2N-D9).The specific procedure was as follows: 100 mg well-ground catalyst powder was dispersed in a triethanolamine solution (10 vol, 100 mL) containing a small amount of H 2 PtCl 6 as the co-catalyst.In the case of the deposition of Pt, the loading of 1.0 wt Pt cocatalyst on sample was performed by an in-situ photodeposition method.Before photocatalytic experiments, the reactant solution was evacuated for 30 min to ensure the anaerobic conditions.The CEL-HXF 300 W xenon lamp with a 420 nm cutoff filter was used as the light source.A flow of cooling water was used during the reaction to maintain the temperature of the reactant solution at 279 K.The evolved gases were analyzed by an online gas chromatography (Ceaulight 7920, 5 A sieve) equipped with a thermal conductive detector (TCD), a flame ionized detector (FID) and methanator. The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) for H 2 production was carried out by using the similar photocatalytic reaction apparatus with different band-pass filters.The AQE was calculated by the following equation. where n (H 2 ), N A , h, c, I, , S and t represent the moles of evolved H 2 , Avogadro constant (6.022 10 23 mol -1 ), Planck constant (6.626 10 -34 J s), speed of light (3.0 10 8 m s -1 ), intensity of irradiation light (24.2 mW cm -2 ), wavelength of the incident monochromatic light (m), irradiation area (25.5 cm 2 ) and the irradiation time (s), respectively. The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was performed in a Schlenk flask (80 mL) under visible light irradiation ( 420 nm).In the Schlenk flask, 30 mg of catalyst powder was dispersed in a solution containing bipyridine (15 mg), H 2 O (1 mL), acetonitrile (3 mL), triethanolamine (1 mL), and CoCl 2 6H 2 O (1 mol).This mixture system was subjected to vacuum degassing and then backfilling with CO 2 gas (99.99).This process was repeated three times, and the flask was filled with CO 2 (0.1 MPa) after the last cycle.The temperature of the reaction solution was maintained at 303 K controlled by a flow of thermostating water during the reaction.The produced gases (CO and H 2 ) were collected after 1 h photocatalytic reaction and detected using a gas chromatography (Agilent 7820A) equipped with a packed molecular sieve column (TDX-1 mesh 42/10).The measurement was repeated three times to confirm the reliability of the data.The potential hydrocarbon products ( e.g. , methane, methanol and formaldehyde) and formic acid were measured by the aforementioned gas chromatography (Ceaulight 7920, Agilent 19095P-Q04 column) and an ion chromatography (Thermo Fisher ICS-50 0 0 ), respectively."

    "content": "For detail on the formation of mtw-CNT, SEM, AFM and TEM were performed to investigate the morphology of precursors and products.Bulk g-C 3 N 4 used as a reference ( Fig. 2 a) displays the typical stacked lamellar structure in accordance with the previous reports 14,15 .Fig. 2 (b) shows that PCP is composed of wellproportioned microrods with a diameter of ca.200 nm.The microrods have good dispersion, probably because like charges repel each other.In contrast, no tubular structure appears for NCP, consisting of irregular 2D ultrathin nanosheets ( Fig. 2 c).The AFM image and the corresponding height profile of NCP demonstrate that the uniform thickness of the 2D nanosheets is determined to be ca.1.31 nm, agreeing well with the 1.32 nm thickness of 4-atom-thick carbon nitride layers along the (002) direction 30 . During the supramolecular preorganization of the precursors in the hydrothermal reactions under different pH, the hydrolysis of melamine could contribute to partial substitution of OH species for terminal NH 2 group, or even the formation of cyanuric acid-related compounds.That is, the precursors contain both OH and NH 2 groups on the surface.As a result, PCP will be positively charged due to the protonation of terminal NH 2 group in acidic solution while NCP may be negatively charged because of the deprotonation of terminal OH group in alkaline solution, analogous to protein hydration.Under electrostatic self-assembling, NCP are adhered onto PCP to form a tubular core-shell morphology with an average diameter of ca .400 nm ( Fig. 2 d).In consideration of the inner size of the microrods, it can be speculated that the shell thickness of the mtw-CNT 1.0 precursor is ca. 100 nm.After the thermal treatment at 823 K, the inner part is decomposed thoroughly while the outer counterpart partially remains, resulting in a hollow tubular morphology with mesoporous nanowalls ( Fig. 2 f).It means that the shells of the as-prepared mtw-CNT 1.0 are mainly derived from the negatively charged wrappings, which is rather thermostable and subsequently polycondense into the tubular structure. Interestingly, the wall thickness of mtw-CNT 1.0 is merely about 13 nm, but it seems strong enough to maintain the hollow micron frameworks ( Fig. 2 h).It implies that the intermolecular interactions among the in-plane and interlayer mtw-CNT networks are strengthened, and the relative polymerization degree might be higher than that of bulk g-C 3 N 4 derived by traditional fabrication.Moreover, it also demonstrates that a drastic volume shrinkage from 100 to 13 nm happens for the external nanoshells after the partial thermal decomposition and polycondensation of the covered NCP.As is well known, the mean free migration path of any photoinduced charges in -conjugated polymers is recognized to be in 10-30 nm range 31 , so the modulation on wall thickness of the g-C 3 N 4 microtubes is believed to facilitate bulk-to-surface charge transfer and contribute to improving photocatalytic activities 32333435 . Additionally, the result shows that the morphology of mtw-CNT is sensitive to the PCP/NCP mole ratio of mtw-CNT precursors.When the ratio is fixed at 0.5, mtw-CNT 0.5 appears tubular clusters with less porosity, compared to mtw-CNT 1.0 .This may be due to the aggregation of excess NCP and the increased sticky probability among mtw-CNT precursors through hydrogen bonding ( Fig. 2 e).Notably, further increasing the ratio to 1.5 generates a porous flaky morphology ( Fig. 2 g).This is a natural result since the insufficient NCP on PCP could hardly endure the drastic shrinkage and decomposition, leading to a severe collapse into porous nanosheets for mtw-CNT 1.5 . Beyond that, the volume shrinkage and decomposition of the PCPNCP precursor also enhances the mesoporosity of mtw-CNT.As shown in Fig. 2 (i), b-CN displays the type-IV isotherms with a small H3 hysteresis loop, indicating its poor mesoporosity and small BET specific surface area (10 m 2 g -1 , Table S1).As for mtw-CNTs, they appear the similar isotherms with pronounced hysteresis loops.The Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) pore size distribution curves indicate that mtw-CNTs contain the abundant mesopores with diameter of 1050 nm centering at about 24 nm and the enlarged specific surface areas ranging from 87 to 122 m 2 g -1 with the increase of PCP/NCP ratios.In contrast, the BJH pore size distribution curve of b-CN indicates its non-porous feature in the same range.Besides, note that no obvious variations of specific surface area and pore size between mtw-CNT 1.0 and mtw-CNT 1.5 could be found.Combined with the distinct morphologies of mtw-CNT 1.0 and mtw-CNT 1.5 , it can be supposed that the enhancement of specific surface area after the hollow-structuring could primarily originate from the mesoporous nanowalls of mtw-CNT.It is believed that the unique hollow mesoporous 1D structure of mtw-CNT could facilitate reactant/product transport by minimizing diffusion barriers and improve exciton harvesting ability on account of the large surface, thin wall and multiple intraductal scattering absorption.In addition, the highly open-up surface structure with hierarchical edges on the mesopores could accelerate charge collection and separation on the tips of the nanostructures to drive the relevant surface-dependent reactions 363738 . Furthermore, the SEM elemental mappings reveal a uniform distribution of C and N elements throughout the mesoporous microtubes, suggesting the homogeneous dispersion of carbon nitride in mtw-CNT 1.0 (Fig. S3).The energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDX) analysis evidences the coexistence of C and N in mtw-CNT 1.0 (Fig. S4).In addition, the EDX spectrum shows that the C/N ratio of mtw-CNT is determined to be 0.74, quite close to the theoretical value (0.75) of g-C 3 N 4 . Direct evidences of the structure and texture of mtw-CNT were determined by XRD and FTIR.All the results are very similar to those of b-CN, indicating that the original g-C 3 N 4 conjugated framework almost retains unchanged ( Fig. 3 ).Fig. 3 (a) shows that mtw-CNTs display the typical diffraction peaks of g-C 3 N 4 at 13.0 and 27.3 , indexed as (100) plane of the in-plane repeating packing and (002) plane of the interlayer-stacking of g-C 3 N 4 , respectively 6,39 .Compared to b-CN, the peak of mtw-CNTs at 13 scarcely appear significant difference, but the interlayer diffraction peak shifts from 27.3 to 27.5 , corresponding to a decrease in the interplanar stacking distance from 0.326 nm to 0.324 nm.The reduction of interlayer spacing might be due to the strengthened interaction forces between the well-ordered g-C 3 N 4 interlayers originated from the intimate self-assembly between the PCP and NCP, consistent with the SEM analysis.Fig. 3 (b) also confirms that no evident changes of IR patterns could be detected between b-CN and mtw-CNTs with the identical bands at 810 cm -1 , 90 0180 0 cm -1 and 3419 cm -1 , related to the vibrations of characteristic heptazine units, C N -C heterocycles and CNH x ( x 1, 2) species of g-C 3 N 4 , respectively 40 . XPS also indicates that mtw-CNT has the same surface chemical states to that of b-CN ( Fig. 4 ).The survey spectra show the peaks at ca .288, 399 and 533 eV are attributed to C 1 s , N 1 s and O 1 s signals, respectively.No Cl-containing or other impure species could be detected for mtw-CNT 1.0 .In the high resolution C 1 s spectra, the peaks centered at 286.0 and 288.1 eV are assigned to CNH x species and sp 2 C N -C coordination of g-C 3 N 4 , respectively 41,42 .The high resolution N 1 s spectra reveal the coexistence of sp 2 -hybridized nitrogen (N C -N), s p 3 -tertiary nitrogen (NC 3 ) and amino functional groups (NH x ) at 398.5, 399.8 and 401.1 eV, respectively 43,44 .Clearly, the XPS fitting result reveals that the CNH x /C total atomic ratio of mtw-CNT 1.0 decreases from 0.052 to 0.018, while the sp 2 -C/C total ratio increases from 0.948 to 0.982, compared with b-CN (Table S2).Simultaneously, the sp 2 -N/C total atomic ratio increases from 0.840 to 0.923, implying that the polymerization degree of mtw-CNT is higher than that of bulk g-C 3 N 4 .Since the sp 2 C N -C or N C -N bond mainly accounts for visible-light-driven band-band excitation of g-C 3 N 4 , the improved sp 2 -C coordination may contribute to the improved opticalelectronic property and the succeeding enhanced photoreactivity of mtw-CNT 45 .Moreover, the result indicates that the surface N/C atomic ratio of mtw-CNT 1.0 (1.481) is relatively higher than that of pristine g-C 3 N 4 (1.328).The detailed deconvolution of N 1 s spectra shows that the sp 3 -N/C total atomic ratio is also increased on mtw-CNT 1.0 .This could be tentatively attributed to the incomplete splicing or partial thermal decomposition of the NCP nanosheets, which individualizes unconjugated corner edges with excessive Ncontaining species, and could generate more active sites on the tips of the opening-up mesopores on mtw-CNT.This will consequently improve the hydrophilic property of mtw-CNT. As for the O 1 s spectra, though negligible change for the relative content of the adsorbed O 2 at 534.0 eV could be found between b-CN (1.39 at) and mtw-CNT 1.0 (1.58 at), the concentration of the adsorbed OH at 532.2 eV is significantly raised up from 2.83 at to 8.15 at after the morphological modification, hopefully beneficial for photocatalytic water splitting.Note that all XRD, FTIR and XPS spectra of mtw-CNT resemble the reference bulk g-C 3 N 4 .It suggests that hollow g-C 3 N 4 -related structures have been successfully constructed via the supramolecular electrostatic self-assembly approach. The optical properties of the materials were investigated by UV-vis DRS, as shown in Fig. 5 (a).It can be found that the as-prepared mtw-CNT 1.0 exhibits a blue-shift of the intrinsic absorption edge, compared to the bulk one.Distinctly, the band-gap energies increase from 2.69 eV (b-CN) to 2.87 eV (mtw-CNT 1.0 ) with the formation of hollow tubular morphology ( Fig. 5 b).This widening of bandgap reflects the quantum confinement effect of the aggregation of the flaky NCP, as shown in the SEM/AFM/TEM images.Further electronic structural details on the morphological control were obtained by Mott-Schottky measurement ( Fig. 5 c).The Mott-Schottky plots of b-CN and mtw-CNT 1.0 display the congeneric positive slopes in the linear region, indicative of an n-type characteristic 46 .The plot of mtw-CNT 1.0 appears a slower slope than that of b-CN, suggesting a higher electron donor density on mtw-CNT 1.0 47 .Moreover, the derived flat-band potentials of b-CN and mtw-CNT 1.0 are estimated to be -1.31V and -1.40 V ( vs. NHE, pH 7), respectively, thermodynamically enabling the photocatalytic reduction of water (H /H 2 ) 48 .Considering that the conduction band minimum (CBM) levels of the most of n-type semiconductors are generally more negative by ca.0.10 V than their flat-band positions 49,50 , the CBM positions of b-CN and mtw-CNT 1.0 are estimated to be -1.41V and -1.50 V, respectively.Combined with the corresponding band-gap energies, the valence band maximum (VBM) levels of b-CN and mtw-CNT 1.0 are located at 1.28 V and 1.37 V ( vs. NHE, pH 7), respectively.The result shows that the redox power of photoinduced electron-hole pairs on mtw-CNT 1.0 is higher than that on the bulk g-C 3 N 4 , according with the consequence of the quantum confinement effect 51,52 .In addition, mtw-CNT 1.0 exhibits the superior light absorption below 413 nm over the bulk one.This prominent optical property could be ascribed to the multiple reflective light absorption within the mesoporous tubular structure and the transmission absorption by the interior through the thin shell of mtw-CNT 1.0 , which is promising to benefit for a prospective high photocatalytic activity.As shown, both of the catalysts demonstrate only an anodic photocurrent and appear a typical behavior of n-type semiconductor, consistent with the previous reports 53,54 .This is also certified by the decrease in the anodic photocurrents as the potential sweeps to the negative direction, since the band bending decreases with the weakened positive bias and the charge recombination increases accordingly.Moreover, the photocurrent of mtw-CNT 1.0 is obviously higher than that of b-CN, and the onset photocurrent potential of mtw-CNT 1.0 is shifted to the negative direction.The transient photocurrent density of mtw-CNT 1.0 is ca .2.5 times as high as that of g-C 3 N 4 at 0 V ( vs .NHE, pH 7).It suggests that the hollow mesoporous thin-shell structure is favorable for bulk-tosurface charge transfer, and facilitates interfacial carrier migration on mtw-CNT, probably due to the appropriate vertical and horizontal diffusion distance agreeing well with the free migration path of the photoinduced charges.This result is further confirmed by the EIS measurement, which is widely recognized that a smaller arc in the EIS Nyquist plot means a faster charge migration or less charge transfer resistance 55,56 .As is depicted in Fig. 6 (b), mtw-CNT 1.0 displays the smaller semicircular diameter by contrast with b-CN, suggesting the facilitated charge transfer and separation in the wall-mesoporous nanotubes.Beyond this, both of the materials exhibit the excellent photoswitching performance with fast response and recovery times under the chopped light illumination, demonstrating their high stability for the photoelectric conversion. To further investigate the photophysical behaviors of the photoinduced charge carriers, combined techniques of steady-state and time-resolved PL spectroscopy were employed ( Fig. 6 c).Under 365 nm excitation, the b-CN sample shows a typical PL profile with a broad peak centered at ca. 470 nm, attributed to the bandband charge recombination of g-C 3 N 4 57,58 .Compared to b-CN, a significant PL quenching of ca .65 is detected for mtw-CNT 1.0 , implying a suppressed charge recombination due to the ideal electron migration channels in the 1D tubular framework and the increased charge diffusion rate in the mesoporous -conjugative C 3 N 4 system 59,60 .Moreover, the PL peak of mtw-CNT 1.0 blue-shifts to 453 nm in line with the widening bandgap, as is revealed by the UV-vis DRS analysis. As known, a longer charge lifetime usually represents a higher possibility of electrons and holes involved in photocatalytic redox reactions, and likely improves the quantum efficiency of the relevant reactions.Thus, the respective emission decay times were quantitatively analyzed by using triexponential decay kinetics with goodness-of-fit parameters ( 2 ) quite close to 1.It can be seen that the PL decay kinetic of mtw-CNT 1.0 is quite slower than that of b-CN ( Fig. 6 d), suggesting the prolonged radiative lifetimes of the photogenerated charge carriers 61 .The detailed fitting result indicates that the lifetimes of the three type of charge carriers are effectively elongated on mtw-CNT 1.0 in comparison with those on b-CN (Table S3).Note that the percentage of the short-lived life-time associated with bulk recombination decreases whereas the values of the long-lived lifetimes related to surface recombination increases on mtw-CNT 1.0 .It shows that the morphology engineering for mtw-CNT successfully prolongs the lifetimes of charge carriers from bulk to surface.Hopefully, excellent photocatalytic activity will be achieved on mtw-CNT. The H 2 evolution activity of catalysts was evaluated by using 10 vol triethanolamine (TEOA) as a sacrificial agent and platinum as a cocatalyst under visible light irradiation ( 420 nm). As shown in Fig. 7 (a), the H 2 evolution rate (HER) on b-CN is 105 mol h -1 g -1 .By contrast, the mtw-CNT samples show superior photocatalytic activities toward water splitting, which are sensitive to the PCP/NCP ratio.When the PCP/NCP ratio increases from 0.5 to 1.0, the HER increases from 3.24 to 3.99 mmol h -1 g -1 , which is 38 times higher than that on the bulk counterpart.Further increasing the PCP/NCP ratio from 1.0 to 1.5, however, a slow drop of HER (3.01 mmol h -1 g -1 ) occurs.It is not surprising that too high PCP/NCP ratio is disadvantageous to the HER over mtw-CNT 1.5 compared to mtw-CNT 1.0 , because the collapse into the porous flaky morphology could hardly benefit from the multiple reflective light absorption in the 1D tubular structure, even though mtw-CNT 1.5 sample possesses a slightly larger specific surface area than mtw-CNT 1.0 (Table S1).It is also verified by the measurement for the 2D g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets derived from NCP (Fig. S5).This asprepared sample appears the resemble sheet-like morphology to mtw-CNT 1.5 , except for larger scale and less mesoporosity.Correspondingly, the HER on the 2D g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets is about 2.55 mmol h -1 g -1 , which is close to mtw-CNT 1.5 but much lower than mtw-CNT 1.0 .The results indicates that the improvement of photocatalytic activity after the structural engineering is not only related to the enlarged specific surface area with formation of mesoporous nanoshells, but also markedly depends on the unique 1D thin-walled tubular structure for efficient visible-light utilization and fast interfacial charge transfer.Moreover, mtw-CNT 1.0 sample retains the good photocatalytic stability in the HER and maintains the high photocatalytic performance for 48 h during the recycling tests ( Fig. 7 b).The XRD, FT-IR and XPS analyses also reveal that distinct change could hardly be detected for the chemical skeletal and composition of mtw-CNT 1.0 used before and after the photocatalytic reaction, exhibiting excellent chemical stability (Fig. S6). The enhancement of photocatalytic HER on mtw-CNT was further confirmed by the AQE measurement.The action spectra of H 2 evolution presented in Fig. 5 (a) is consistent well with the corresponding absorption spectra of b-CN and mtw-CNT 1.0 , demonstrating that the structural engineering of g-C 3 N 4 can drastically promote the AQE for H 2 production.Impressively, the overall H 2 -AQEs of mtw-CNT 1.0 under different excitation wavelengths are much higher than those on b-CN, even though mtw-CNT 1.0 displays inferior optical absorption above 413 nm.This implies a higher light-conversion efficiency on the hollow structure of mtw-CNT 1.0 .As shown, the H 2 -AQE at 420 15 nm is determined to be 8.7 over mtw-CNT 1.0 ( Fig. 7 c), much better than that on g-C 3 N 4 (0.2).In comparison, the typical porous mpg-CN and CM-CN were also taken as references.The result indicates that the H 2 -AQE of mtw-CNT 1.0 is ca .1.9 and 5.8 times as high as those of mpg-CN and CM-CN, respectively, exhibiting its remarkable photocatalytic performance towards water splitting under visible light irradiation. Apart from the water splitting reaction, photocatalytic CO 2 reduction test was also carried out.In this measurement, Co(bipy) 3 2 is used as a cocatalyst for promoting CO evolution and inhibiting H 2 production in acetonitrile solution under CO 2 atmosphere, while TEOA is employed as electron donor 626364 .Upon visible light irradiation ( 420 nm) for 1 h, the system with mtw-CNT 1.0 photocatalyst generates CO (7.6 mol) and H 2 (0.3 mol) and the catalytic turnover number relative to the amount of cobalt ions and the selectivity for CO production are calculated as 7.9 and 96.0, respectively ( Fig. 7 d and Table S4).In addition, no detectable potential hydrocarbon products (e.g., methane, methanol, formaldehyde and formic acid) are generated in this photocatalytic CO 2 reduction system, consistent with the results of previous works 65666768 .Obviously, mtw-CNT 1.0 exhibits the superior selectivity for CO production over the bulk g-C 3 N 4 and the typical porous g-C 3 N 4 catalysts, i.e. mpg-CN and CM-CN prepared by hardtemplating and soft-templating methods.The main reason could be that the unique 1D thin-walled tubular feature facilitates CO 2 adsorption and photoinduced charge separation for the photocatalytic reduction reaction.Besides, the variation of the band structure of mtw-CNT may also account for the higher CO 2 -to-CO selectivity.The widened band gap of mtw-CNT results in a higher redox ability of photogenerated charge carriers, thermodynamically promoting CO 2 /CO reduction reaction (0.53 V vs .NHE, pH 7) as well as kinetically improving reaction rate by a stronger driving force for charge transfer 62,69,70 . As last, possible mechanisms of photocatalytic H 2 evolution and CO 2 reduction on mtw-CNT are proposed ( Fig. 8 ).Under visible light irradiation, the electron-hole pairs are generated on the surface and inwall of mtw-CNT due to the direct and multiple intraductal scattering absorption.Because of the mesoporous thin-walled characteristic on mtw-CNT, it promotes the charge separation via the accelerated inside-to-outside migration and the efficient capture by adsorbed reactants on hierarchical edges of its mesopores.With the assistance of Pt or Co(bipy) 3 2 cocatalyst, the accumulated electrons will readily react with adsorbed H (access I) or CO 2 (access II) to produce H 2 or CO, respectively.Of course, these reduction reactions could also occur inside the hollow microtubes.Meanwhile, the photoinduced holes on mtw-CNT are correspondingly separated and subsequently consumed by sacrificial reagent TEOA."

    "content": "In summary, mesoporous thin-walled g-C 3 N 4 microtubes were successfully fabricated by using a green and flexible supramolecular electrostatic self-assembly method without any additional hard templates or soft templates.The as-prepared hollow g-C 3 N 4 exhibits excellent photocatalytic performance towards H 2 production with an optimum rate of 3.99 mmol h -1 g -1 ( 420 nm) and remarkable apparent quantum efficiency of 8.7 ( 420 15 nm).In addition, a high CO 2 -to-CO selectivity of 96 ( 420 nm) is also achieved on the hollow structure, which is much better than those over the most previously reported porous g-C 3 N 4 photocatalysts prepared by the conventional hard-templating and soft-templating methods.The great enhancement of photocatalytic activity can be mainly ascribed to the synergistic effect among the enlarged specific surface area, improved optical absorption, strengthened redox power, and enhanced photoinduced charge separation from bulk to surface, endowed by the unique mesoporous thin-walled hollow structure and 1D feature.This work presents a facile environmental-friendly strategy to design and construct the morphologically functionalized g-C 3 N 4 and offers a reference self-assembly route to develop highly active polymeric photocatalysts towards solar energy conversion.

Fig. 6 (a) exhibits the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) of b-CN and mtw-CNT 1.0 samples irradiated by intermittent visible light.As shown, both of the catalysts demonstrate only an anodic photocurrent and appear a typical behavior of n-type semiconductor, consistent with the previous reports53,54 .This is also certified by the decrease in the anodic photocurrents as the potential sweeps to the negative direction, since the band bending decreases with the weakened positive bias and the charge recombination increases accordingly.Moreover, the photocurrent of mtw-CNT 1.0 is obviously higher than that of b-CN, and the onset photocurrent potential of mtw-CNT 1.0 is shifted to the negative direction.The transient photocurrent density of mtw-CNT 1.0 is ca .2.5 times as high as that of g-C 3 N 4 at 0 V ( vs .NHE, pH 7).It suggests that the hollow mesoporous thin-shell structure is favorable for bulk-tosurface charge transfer, and facilitates interfacial carrier migration on mtw-CNT, probably due to the appropriate vertical and horizontal diffusion distance agreeing well with the free migration path of the photoinduced charges.This result is further confirmed by the EIS measurement, which is widely recognized that a smaller arc in the EIS Nyquist plot means a faster charge migration or less Fig. 6.(a) Potentiodynamic scans (20 mV s -1 ) in a 0.2 M Na 2 SO 4 solution under chopped illumination (1 Hz, 420 nm).Insert shows the transient photocurrent responses recorded at 0 V ( vs .NHE, pH 7).(b) Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.(c) PL spectra achieved at ex 365 nm.(d) Time-resolved PL decay profiles of catalysts photoexcited by a picosecond pulsed light emitting diode ( ex 402.8nm).
