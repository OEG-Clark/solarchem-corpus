    "content": "Harvesting value-added products by CO 2 reduction through photocatalysis is a sustainable approach.Against halogen-doping treatment, few-layer iodinene (FLI 2 ) was used innovatively to construct 2D/2D van der Waals heterojunction with carbon nitride nanosheets (CNNS) for CO 2 reduction under visible light irradiation.The photocatalyst achieved an enhanced CO production rate of 34.22 mol g -1 h -1 , which was 7.76 times as pristine CNNS.Improved activity was attributed to FLI 2 /CNNS maintained tri-s-triazine crystal structure and polymeric framework of CNNS.FLI 2 /CNNS formed a contact interface by van der Waals force, where FLI 2 served as an electron acceptor and CNNS acted as an electron donor, beneficial for electron transfer.This carrier migration tendency in FLI 2 /CNNS was confirmed by the DFT calculation of Fermi level and electron density distribution, which led to increased charge separation and decreased charge recombination.This work proposes the novel 2D/ 2D FLI 2 /CNNS and highlights the potential of metal-free heterojunction for efficient photocatalysis."

    "content": "Urea was obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.Iodine was purchased from Aladdin.All chemicals were of analytical grade and used without further purification. 13CO 2 (99 ) gas was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The FLI 2 was synthesized by the liquid ultrasonic stripping method.Specifically, 5 g bulk iodine powder was dispersed in 1 L ultrapure water and sonicated for 4 h.After exfoliation, the dispersion was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min with two times to remove bulk iodine at the bottom, resulting in the suspension of FLI 2 on the top.The concentration of FLI 2 suspension was determined to 82.20 g mL -1 by an inductive coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS, Agilent 7800).The power of ultrasonication is 700 W for both iodine exfoliation and composite preparation.The CNNS was prepared by thermal polymerization with urea and sequential thermal exfoliation, as described in Text S1 (Supporting Information, SI). The FLI 2 /CNNS was synthesized by mixing 100 mg CNNS and a certain amount of FLI 2 solution.First, as-prepared CNNS was dispersed in 20 mL ultrapure water and kept under sonication for 1 h.Then, a certain volume of FLI 2 suspension was added to 20 mL CNNS suspension (5 mg mL -1 ) and sonicated for two hours.The dispersion was then stirred at 400 r/min for 12 h to obtain a stable homogeneous mixture of FLI 2 and CNNS.Finally, the FLI 2 /CNNS was collected by vacuum filtered and freeze-drying.A sequence of FLI 2 /CNNS heterostructure with different iodine content was obtained by adjusting the amount of FLI 2 dispersion (1 mL, 5 mL, 10 mL, 20 mL, 40 mL, and 800 mL).The obtained samples with FLI 2 content (0.08 wt, 0.40 wt, 0.80 wt, 1.60 wt, 3.20 wt, 39.70 wt) were identified as FLI 2 /CNNS-1, FLI 2 / CNNS-2, FLI 2 /CNNS-3, FLI 2 /CNNS-4, FLI 2 /CNNS-5, and FLI 2 /CNNS-6, respectively. The morphology of samples was inspected with a Quant 250FEG scanning electron microscope (SEM) and a JEM-200CX transmission electron microscopy (TEM).The atomic force microscopy (AFM) was performed on Dimension Icon of Bruker.The zeta potentials were characterized in the aqueous dispersion on the Malvern NanoZS90new.The pore parameters were measured with N 2 adsorption analyzer (Micromeritics TriStar II 3020) at 77 K.The surface area and pore volume were calculated based on the Brunauer Emmett Teller (BET) and BJH (Barrett-Joyner-Halenda) models, respectively.The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of catalysts were obtained by a Bruker-AXS D8 advance instrument.Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy was performed on a Nicolet iS10 spectrometer.The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was obtained using a PHI system (Quantera II Ulvac-Phi Inc).The temperature programmed desorption (TPD) of CO 2 and CO molecules was performed from 50 C to 350 C at a ramping rate of 10 C min -1 on an automated flow chemisorption analyzer (ChemBET Pulsar).The ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-vis DRS) were measured on a UV-vis spectrometer with an integrating sphere accessory (TU-1901, Beijing Persee).The photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved PL spectra were recorded on a JobinYvon SPEX Fluorolog-3-P spectroscope and Edinburgh FS980 spectrometer, respectively.The 13 C isotope test was carried out on a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS, Shimadzu QP2010 Ultra). The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was carried out in a 300 mL quartz reactor (Labsolar-6A, Beijing PerfectLight) via the gas-solid interface reaction.Before photocatalytic reaction, 50 mg photocatalysts were uniformly dispersed on a quartz plate placed inside the reactor.Meanwhile, 3 mL H 2 O was scattered at the bottom of the reactor, functioning as the reductant.No sacrificial agent was used during the photocatalytic process.The reactor was vacuum degassed to remove air and high-purity CO 2 gas was injected into the reactor till 1 bar pressure.To trigger the photocatalysis, the reactor was exposed to irradiation light at the UV-vis spectrum with 320 nm780 nm powered by a 300 W Xe arc lamp (PLS-SXE 300c).The reaction temperature was maintained at 20 C by recirculated cooling set.The amounts of produced CO and methane (CH 4 ) were examined by a gas chromatograph (FULI GC9790 II) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD).The photocatalytic test of labeling 13 CO 2 was performed in the quartz reactor under the same photoreduction condition. The Mott-Schottky curves, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and transient photocurrent response (TPR) were obtained on a CHI 660E electrochemical workstation equipped with a standard three-electrode system.In the threeelectrode system, the platinum foil was used as the counter electrode, the Ag/AgCl electrode was served as the reference electrode, and the catalyst deposited on a conductive indium tin oxide was used as the working electrode.2 mg catalysts were dispersed into 2 mL ethanol, H. Liu et al. then mixed with 10 L Nafion under 60 min ultrasonication, forming a homogenous suspension. 2 mL above suspension was dripped onto the surface of conductive indium tin oxide and dried in ambient condition.The measurements were performed in a beaker with 0.10 M Na 2 SO 4 solution as electrolyte. All calculations were performed by the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) program, based on the density functional theory (DFT).The wave function of the core region was described with the projector augmented wave (PAW) method.Structure optimization was conducted by the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE), with the cut-off energy set at 450 eV.The k-mesh was selected to be 2 2 1 for the primitive cell of both CNNS and FLI 2 .The energy convergence limit was 10 -5 eV during the self-consistent iterative calculation."

    "content": "The metal-free FLI 2 /CNNS heterojunctions were synthesized by a facile ultrasonic-assisted exfoliation and mixing method, as illustrated in Scheme 1.This scheme aimed to introduce halogen element as the electron acceptor, and maintain the crystal texture of CN for photocatalysis.The CNNS were obtained by thermal polymerization and exfoliation, and the FLI 2 was acquired by exfoliating the bulk iodine under ultrasound.Instead of halogen doping treatment, the atom-thick FLI 2 was inserted between layers of CNNS to form FLI 2 /CNNS heterojunctions self-assembled by the van der Waals force. The morphology and spatial elemental distribution of FLI 2 /CNNS-2 heterostructures were investigated by SEM, TEM, and AFM.As shown in the SEM image of Fig. 1a, the FLI 2 /CNNS-2 exhibited a similar lamellar structure as CNNS and FLI 2 (Fig. S1 a andb).The TEM-EDS elemental mapping results (Fig. 1b) revealed that FLI 2 /CNNS-2 heterostructures were composed of I, C and N. It can be seen that I element was uniformly distributed throughout the whole CNNS, indicating the successful synthesis of homogeneous FLI 2 /CNNS.The TEM images (Fig. 1c) of FLI 2 / CNNS-2 heterostructures presented the graphene-like layered structure, resembling the CNNS and FLI 2 (Fig. S2 a andb).The lattice fringe (0.453 nm) of orthorhombic iodine 22 and the crystal lattice of CNNS (Fig. S2a) coexisted in the TEM image of FLI 2 /CNNS-2, revealing the typical overlap structure of 2D/2D FLI 2 /CNNS heterojunction.To further confirm the 2D/2D interfacial interaction between CNNS and FLI 2 , the AFM analysis was performed in Fig. 1d andS3.The thickness of FLI 2 /CNNS-2 was approximately 6 nm and the altitude variation of 4 nm could be attributed to the thickness of CNNS (Fig. S4 a andb).The edge thickness of 2 nm in FLI 2 /CNNS-2 can be assigned to FLI 2 , which was confirmed by the AFM image of FLI 2 (Fig. S5 a andb).This result further confirmed the formation of 2D/2D structure of FLI 2 /CNNS heterostructure.The composite of FLI 2 /CNNS-2 was further confirmed by zeta potential tests, as exhibited in Fig. S6.FLI 2 /CNNS-2 had the negative zeta potential of -2.40 mV, which decreased as compared to CNNS (-13.10 mV) and FLI 2 (-18.50 mV).The decrease for FLI 2 /CNNS-2 may be caused by the adsorption of FLI 2 on the surface of CNNS, as manifested by the aforementioned TEM and AFM results.This further indicates that FLI 2 /CNNS composite formed by van der Waals interaction rather than strong electrostatic interaction between FLI 2 and CNNS. To further explore the pore structures of FLI 2 /CNNS-2 and CNNS, the N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms and pore volume distribution were tested, as shown in Fig. S7 and Table S1.FLI 2 /CNNS-2 and CNNS both had type II adsorption isotherms with H3 hysteresis loop, which are the characteristic isotherms of layer structure.As depicted in Fig. S7b, FLI 2 / CNNS-2 and CNNS have similar trends for pore volume distribution with an average pore volume of 0.18 cm 3 g -1 (Table S1).These results confirm that FLI 2 /CNNS-2 have the same lamellar structure as CNNS, in accordance with SEM and TEM morphology analysis.The slight decrease of BET surface area (81.20 m 2 g -1 ) and BJH adsorption average pore diameter (19.09 nm) for FLI 2 /CNNS are due to the thickness increase compared to CNNS 25. The crystalline phase of FLI 2 /CNNS-X was investigated by XRD measurements and the results were shown in Fig. 2a.The diffraction pattern of FLI 2 was fitted well with the standard orthorhombic phase of iodine (JCPDS card No. 43-0304).Notably, all FLI 2 /CNNS-X samples only exhibited the characteristic peaks of CNNS at 13.20 and 27.80 , corresponding to in-plane repeated units and interlayer reflection of the graphitic-like structure, respectively.The introduction of FLI 2 presented no obvious effect on the XRD peaks of CNNS, meaning the van der Waals interaction between FLI 2 and CNNS was relatively weak and cannot change the crystal structure of CNNS.No diffraction peaks of FLI 2 were observed, attributed to the low FLI 2 amount and high dispersion on the surface of CNNS. The functional groups on the surface of FLI 2 , CNNS, and FLI 2 /CNNS-X were investigated by FT-IR spectrometry.As shown in Fig. 2b, the FT-IR spectra revealed the obtained FLI 2 /CNNS-X had a similar polymeric CN framework to that of CNNS, indicating that compounding with FLI 2 had no significant influence on the chemical structure of CNNS.The peaks at 815 cm -1 , 1000-1800 cm -1 , and 3185-3261 cm -1 were assigned to the deformation vibrations of the tri-s-triazine ring, the stretching vibration of C-N, and the -NH 2 groups. The C 1s, N 1s, and I 3d high resolution XPS spectra of FLI 2 /CNNS-2 were examined to analyze the chemical state of FLI 2 /CNNS-X heterostructures, as shown in Fig. 2c-e of C 1s (Fig. 2c) were located at 284.60 eV, 288.25 eV, and 293.71 eV, corresponding to aromatic carbon atoms, the sp 2 C in the heptazine units and the -excitation, which exhibits a positive shift compared with CNNS (Fig. S8a).The N 1 s peaks with binding energies of 398.71 eV, 400.44 eV, and 404.71 eV, were assigned to sp 2 N atoms in triazine rings (C-N C), tertiary N (C 3 -N or C-N-H), and the -excitation (Fig. 2d). There was also a positive shift of N 1 s compared to pristine CNNS (Fig. S8b).These positive shifts of binding energy for C 1s and N 1s suggested the electrons transfer from CNNS to FLI 2 .There was no obvious I 3d peak in the FLI 2 /CNNS-2 heterostructure due to the small content (Fig. S9a).In contrast, the peaks of 618.34 eV and 629.83 eV corresponding to I 3d 5/2 and I 3d 3/2 were found in FLI 2 /CNNS-6 (Fig. 2e), which has a negative shift as compared to that of FLI 2 (618.75 eV and 630.28 eV, Fig. S9b).This shift further demonstrated that FLI 2 acted as an electron acceptor and CNNS acted as an electron donor in FLI 2 /CNNS heterostructures, indicating the strong interface interaction between FLI 2 and CNNS. The basic potential and adsorption sites of CNNS and FLI 2 /CNNS were analyzed by CO 2 TPD.As presented in Fig. S10, FLI 2 /CNNS and CNNS exhibited the broad peaks centered at 158 C and 156 C, respectively.These close desorption temperatures indicated that FLI 2 / CNNS and CNNS shared the same type of basic sites for CO 2 adsorption.These basic sites originated from the -NH 2 groups formed via the incomplete condensation of precursors and the breakage of CN framework 26. The optical adsorption properties of the resultant materials were explored by UV-vis DRS, as shown in Fig. 3a.The FLI 2 /CNNS-2 possessed a similar absorption property of visible light with CNNS, which is different from the fluctuating light absorption of FLI 2 (Fig. S11).Compared to CNNS, FLI 2 /CNNS-2 shows a slight enhancement in the light absorption threshold and capability due to the introduction of FLI 2 , which may benefit from the light absorption of FLI 2 .According to the Tauc plots in Fig. S12, the CNNS possessed a bandgap of 3.04 eV calculated by the Kubelka-Munk method 27.The valence-band potential of CNNS was confirmed by XPS spectra, as presented in Fig. S13.CNNS displayed the VB edge with the maximum energy of 2.18 eV.Then, the valence-band potential of normal hydrogen electrode (E VB, NHE ) can be calculated based on the formula: E VB, NHE E VB, XPS -4.44 28, where was the work function of the instrument (4.21 eV).The E VB, NHE of CNNS was determined to be 1.95 V. Combined with the obtained bandgap, the conduction band (E CB, NHE ) of CNNS was -1.09 V.The VB edge of FLI 2 was 0.84 eV, provided by DFT calculation as shown in Fig. S14.As shown in Mott-Schottky plots in Fig. S15, both CNNS and FLI 2 /CNNS-2 presented positive slopes, indicating their ntype semiconductor characteristic. The charge recombination and migration behaviors of the pristine CNNS and FLI 2 /CNNS-2 were investigated by PL and time-resolved PL spectra.As observed in Fig. 3b, the pristine CNNS presented an obvious emission peak, corresponding to the radiative recombination of electron-hole pairs.After the combination with I 2 , the emission peak of FLI 2 /CNNS-2 dropped sharply, indicating the noticeably improved charge transfer and trapping.The time-resolved PL experiments were further carried out to investigate the charge carrier lifetimes of CNNS and FLI 2 /CNNS-2.As shown in Fig. 3c, the charge lifetimes were obtained by fitting those curves by Eq.S1 29 and the corresponding lifetime parameters were exhibited in Table S2.The average lifetimes of charge carriers in pristine CNNS and FLI 2 /CNNS-2 were 10.5250 ns and 7.5466 ns, respectively.Such decreases of average lifetimes observed with FLI 2 /CNNS-2 were attributed to the opening of an additional channel of interfacial electron transfer from excited CNNS to FLI 2 30. The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance of the as-prepared photocatalysts was measured under visible light irradiation.As shown in Fig. 4a, CO and CH 4 were detected during the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction and CO was the main reduction product for both CNNS and FLI 2 /CNNS-X systems.Note that H 2 was not found among the products, indicating the inhibition of competing reactions of water splitting.Other reduction products, such as methanol, formic acid, and formaldehyde, were also not detected during the photocatalytic process.Moreover, the selectivity of all the as-prepared photocatalysts for CO 2 transformation under visible light irradiation was summarized in Table S3.The selectivity of CO for the FLI 2 /CNNS-X hybrids was all higher than that of CNNS (79.24 ) and the FLI 2 /CNNS-1 reach the highest CO selectivity of 98.63 under visible light irradiation.To explain the improved CO selectivity of heterojunction, CO TPD tests for CNNS and FLI 2 /CNNS-2 were conducted.In Fig. S16, it can be found that both CNNS and FLI 2 / CNNS-2 had a single broad desorption peak, indicating that they presented similar mode of interaction with CO species.The CO adsorption capacity of FLI 2 /CNNS-2 was 0.28 mmol g -1 increased by 21.70 compared to CNNS (0.23 mmol g -1 ).The peak position of FLI 2 /CNNS-2 was at lower temperature (140 C) than CNNS (150 C).These denoted that FLI 2 /CNNS-2 possessed more CO surface coverage with lower activation energy for CO desorption, which could improve the selectivity of CO. The bare CNNS exhibited low photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity with the production rate of CO of 4.41 mol g -1 h -1 .On the contrary, the whole prepared FLI 2 /CNNS photocatalysts presented remarkable enhancement photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction and the FLI 2 / CNNS-2 showed the highest CO production rate of 34.22 mol g -1 h -1 , which is 7.76 times compared with the pristine CNNS.The CO 2 reduction performance of CNNS is obviously improved with the incorporation of FLI 2 .Further increasing the FLI 2 loading resulted in a drop of CO production rate to 23.02 mol g -1 h -1 . 13CO 2 tracer was used to determine the carbon source of CO product catalyzed by FLI 2 /CNNS-2.In the mass spectrum of 13 C isotope test (Fig. S17), there was a peak at m/z 29 corresponding to 13 CO, illustrating that the carbon source of CO was CO 2 molecules in the photoreduction with FLI 2 /CNNS-2.the process of two-electron reduction to form CO, by Eq.S4 3.In the first step of CO 2 activation, the photocatalyst transferred one electron to the adsorbed CO 2 molecule.Then, one more electron was injected to form CO, followed by desorption.The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activities of CNNS and FLI 2 /CNNS-2 under full spectrum were measured, as exhibited in Fig. S18.It can be seen that the CO production rate of FLI 2 /CNNS was up to 51.24 mol g -1 h -1 under full spectrum, which was 11.09 times as high as CNNS.The efficient CO production of FLI 2 /CNNS under full spectrum can be attributed to its enhanced light absorption under UV irradiation (Fig. 3a) and the improvement of charge separation.In Fig. S19, the apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of FLI 2 /CNNS-2 at 420 nm was determined to be about 0.019 , which was 2.17 times higher than that of CNNS (0.006). To evaluate the reusable performance and long-term stability of FLI 2 /CNNS-2, repeated experiments of four cycles were operated, as displayed in Fig. 4b.The FLI 2 /CNNS-2 retained the steady evolution rate of CO and CH 4 after four cycles of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, indicating excellent photocatalytic stability.Moreover, the FLI 2 /CNNS-2 still maintained the high photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance even continuing irradiation for 12 h (Fig. 4c).Moreover, no obvious change was found in the SEM image, XRD patterns, FT-IR spectra (Fig. S20), and XPS spectra (Fig. S21) of FLI 2 /CNNS-2 before and after 12 h of visible light irradiation, demonstrating the high structural and chemical stability for FLI 2 /CNNS-2.The good stability of FLI 2 /CNNS-2 can be attributed to van der Waals interaction between FLI 2 and CNNS 31, which inhibited the sublimation phenomenon of FLI 2 . To evaluate the photo-generated carrier separation and electrical conductivity between FLI 2 and CNNS, electrochemical measurements including LSV, EIS and TPR were conducted.As displayed in Fig. 5a, FLI 2 /CNNS-2 exhibited the larger photocurrent density of 82.99 A cm -2 obtained at -0.8 V (vs Ag/AgCl) compared with that of CNNS (51.72 A cm -2 ), which could be explained that the separation of electron-hole pair was promoted and much more photo-generated electrons were migrated to the electrode surface 32.Moreover, the overpotential value of FLI 2 /CNNS-2 reduced compared with CNNS, implying that the introduction of FLI 2 can promote the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .The Nyquist plots of CNNS and FLI 2 /CNNS-2 were presented in Fig. 5b.FLI 2 /CNNS-2 exhibited a smaller semicircle, indicating the improved separation efficiency of photo-generated carriers after the introduction of FLI 2 , which highly accorded with LSV results.Notably, the value of charge transfer resistance (R ct ) decreased from 1529 for CNNS to 389.70 for FLI 2 /CNNS-2, suggesting that the loading of FLI 2 could absorb electrons from CNNS, thus effectively reduced the electrochemical impedance in the carrier transfer process and improved the electron mobility 33.In the TPR of Fig. 5c, FLI 2 / CNNS-2 also presented the higher photocurrent density than that of CNNS, which was consistent with the results of LSV and EIS, indicating the fast charge separation and effective active electrons transfer 34. The tendency of charge migration between CNNS and FLI 2 was further revealed by DFT calculations 35,36.On account of the average potential profile along the fractional coordinate, the Fermi level (E F ) and their work functions of CNNS and FLI 2 were calculated to be -4.397eV and -6.074 eV (vs.absolute vacuum scale, AVS), respectively (Fig. 6 a andb).The electrons of CNNS would spontaneously transfer to FLI 2 at the heterojunction interface to equilibrate the E F difference.This migration resulted in the electron enrichment in FLI 2 and hole rise in CNNS, developing an internal electric field in the composites.The electron acceptor role of FLI 2 made it function as the active sites, on which CO 2 reacted with the photo-generated electrons to form CO. The basic sites of -NH 2 groups on CNNS can benefit the accumulation of CO 2 on FLI 2 /CNNS, which may enhance the CO 2 amount around the active sites of FLI 2 within the overlap structure of FLI 2 /CNNS.Furthermore, the heterojunction interface between CNNS and FLI 2 was built and the electron density distribution was simulated (Fig. 6c).It can be directly seen the surface of FLI 2 was in the condition of electron accumulation, whereas the electron was losing from the surface of CNNS.Simultaneously, as schematized in Fig. 6d, the band edge of CNNS bent upward as the electron donor, and that of FLI 2 bent downward as the electron acceptor.The opposite bending constructed an enhanced energy barrier at the interface, inhibiting the electronic backflow from FLI 2 to CNNS.The pathways for electron transfer are as follows: The electrons of CNNS leaped from VB into the CB by optical excitation.The excited electrons transferred to FLI 2 at the contact interface from CNNS.Then, these electrons transferred to the adsorbed CO 2 molecule on the FLI 2 to proceed the reduction process."
