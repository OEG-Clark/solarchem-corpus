    "content": "Photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 is recognized as a promising method to reduce CO 2 emission and produce available chemical energy simultaneously.CdS-based photocatalysts have been intensively studied for CO 2 reduction, due to their excellent optical response and suitable band structures.However, the photocorrosion of CdS seriously restricts their application.To reduce the photocorrosion, CdS/ZIF-8 composites with core-shell structures are prepared.The experimental results show that the modification of ZIF-8 shell can not only improve the photostability of CdS, but also enhance its CO 2 adsorption capacity without impairing its light harvesting ability.CdS/ZIF-8 catalyst shows higher efficiency and better selectivity than that of unmodified CdS in photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 to CO, which is attributed to its higher CO 2 adsorption capability.Moreover, CdS/ ZIF-8 composites exhibit high photostability."

    "content": "All reagents were of analytical grade and used without further purification.Thiourea, Cd(NO 3 ) 2 4H 2 O, PVP, Zn(NO 3 ) 2 6H 2 O, 2-methylimidazole, 2,2-bipyridine, triethanolamine (TEOA) and CoCl 2 were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.(Shanghai, China).Milli-Q water was used through the whole experiments. CdS nanoparticles were prepared according to a previously reported method.17 Briefly, thiourea (0.53 g,7.0 mmol), Cd(NO 3 ) 2 4H 2 O (2.16 g, 7.0 mmol) and PVP (0.78 g, 7.0 mmol) were dissolved in ethylene glycol (70 mL) to form a clear solution.Then, the mixture was transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave with 100 mL inner volume and maintained at 120 C for 12 h.After the autoclave was cooled to room temperature, 50 mL methanol was added into the obtained solution to precipitate CdS nanoparticles.The yellow products were collected by centrifugation at 10000 rpm for 10 min, washed with methanol and water alternatively for three times, and then freeze-dried under vacuum for 12 h. CdS/ZIF-8 composite was fabricated by in-situ heterogeneous deposition.In detail, 32 mg CdS nanoparticles were added into 10 mL methanol and sonicated for few minutes to ensure good dispersion.Next, 0.2974 g Zn(NO 3 ) 2 6H 2 O was dissolved in 50 mL methanol (20 mM), then mixed with the CdS suspension (10 mL, 3.2 mgmL -1 ) and stirred at room temperature for 1 h.After that, 2-methylimidazole (0.3284 g) was dispersed into 50 mL methanol, and the obtained solution was poured into the former mixture under stirring, followed by being stirred for another 3 h to make sure ZIF-8 grew on CdS nanoparticles uniformly and sufficiently.The precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 1500 rpm for 10 min.The upper suspension layer was light milky white because there were a few uncombined ZIF-8 crystals generated inevitably.Finally, the products were washed with methanol and water, then freeze-dried under vacuum for 12 h.In addition, the CdS/ZIF-8 composites with different ZIF-8 shell thickness were prepared by altering the concentration of Zn 2 .When the concentrations of Zn 2 were fixed to 40 and 80 mM, the obtained composites were noted as CdS/ZIF-8-40 and CdS/ZIF-8-80, respectively. ZIF-8 nanocrystals were fabricated according to a previous report with a slight modification 33.In brief, Zn(NO 3 ) 2 6H 2 O (0.5948 g) was dissolved in 50 mL methanol (40 mM), and 2-methylimidazole (0.6568 g) was dissolved in 50 mL methanol (160 mM).Subsequently, the latter solution was added into the former under magnetic stirring for 3 h.The milky white suspension was centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 10 min.The precipitate was collected, washed with methanol and water, then freeze-dried under vacuum for 12 h. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a D/Max 2550 X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku, Japan) using a Cu K radiation source.Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained by FEI HELIOS Nano Lab 600i (USA).Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) elemental mapping were performed on FEI Titan G2 60-300 with spherical aberration correction (USA).X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data were gained from ESCALAB 250Xi (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) with Al K radiation as the X-ray source.UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of the samples were recorded via a Shimadzu UV-2550 spectrophotometers (Japan).The nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms were measured using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 equipment (USA), and the carbon dioxide adsorption-desorption isotherms were determined at 25 C by the same equipment.All the materials were degassed at 90 C before the measurements. Photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 was carried out by using a gasclosed quartz reactor (250 mL) with an optically-clear quartz cover 36.At first, 40 mg catalyst, 200 mg 2,2-bipyridine, 10 mL TEOA and 10 mol CoCl 2 were added into 60 mL component solvent (acetonitrile/ H 2 O 2:1) and dispersed uniformly.Then, the mixture was transferred into the quartz reactor and stirred with a magnetic stirrer.Before illumination, the reaction system was bubbled with high-purity CO 2 in the dark for 15 min, followed by being tightly closed at 0.1 MPa CO 2 pressure.The reactor was irradiated by a 300 W Xe lamp equipped with a 420 nm cut-off filter through the top quartz window.The light intensity was kept at 500 mW/cm 2 and the temperature of the reaction system was maintained at 25 C by a circulating water bath.In the process of photocatalytic reaction, gaseous products were analyzed on an Agilent 7890B gas chromatograph equipped with a methanizer, a TCD and an FID at set intervals.The calibration curves of CO and H 2 were obtained by injecting different amount of pure gases into the reaction system.The cycle stability performance was evaluated by recovering the photocatalysts and repeating the photocatalytic reaction using a fresh solution. Photocurrent measurements were performed on an RST electrochemical workstation using a typical three-electrode system.An Ag/ AgCl electrode and a Pt plate served as the reference electrode and the counter electrode respectively.The working electrode was made by dipcoating samples onto fluorine-tin oxide (FTO) glasses.During this process, the FTO glass was covered partly by medical tape with a 1.4 cm 2 exposed area.5 mg samples were dispersed into 0.5 mL ethanol uniformly, and then 20 l suspension was spread onto the exposed area of the FTO glass for three times, followed by being dried in the air for 12 h.The three-electrode system was placed in a 0.5 M Na 2 SO 4 aqueous solution, and a 300 W Xe lamp equipped with a 420 nm cut-off filter was used as the light source."

    "content": "The crystal structure of as-prepared samples is analyzed by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD).As shown in Fig. 1, all of the characteristic diffraction peaks can be assigned to hexagonal phase CdS (JCPDS 41-1049).Meanwhile, the pattern of the pure ZIF-8 nanocrystals is in a good agreement with that of the literature 32.As expected, it can be seen from Fig. 1 that the peaks in the XRD pattern of CdS/ZIF-8 composite are the combination of those of CdS and ZIF-8.The peaks at 7.4( 011), 12.8(112) and 18.1(222) are attributed to ZIF-8 and the peaks at 24.9(100), 26.5(002), 28.2(101), 43.8(110), 47.8(103) and 51.9(112) correspond to CdS (JCPDS 41-1049).However, the peak intensities ascribed to ZIF-8 are relatively weak, mainly because the mass fraction of ZIF-8 in the CdS/ZIF-8 composite is much smaller than that of CdS. The morphology and structure of pure CdS nanoparticles and CdS/ ZIF-8 composite are measured by SEM and TEM.Fig. 2a reveals that CdS nanoparticles are uniform spherical particles with diameters of 280-360 nm and rough surface.After ZIF-8 nanocrystals grew on CdS, the spherical morphology of the nanoparticles is well maintained and the average diameter increases slightly (see Fig. 2b).Moreover, the surface of CdS/ZIF-8 composite is much glossier and smoother than that of CdS nanosphere, suggesting the successful growth of ZIF-8 nanocrystals on the surface of CdS nanoparticles.Meanwhile, from Fig. 2c d, we can easily figure out that CdS nanoparticles are coated by ZIF-8 crystals uniformly and closely, resulting in a typical core-shell structure.It is noteworthy that the pure CdS nanoparticles are negatively charged (see Fig. S2).Thus, in the fabrication process of CdS/ZIF-8 composite, zinc ions were first mixed with CdS suspension to ensure good adsorption, which could further promote the uniform and close growth of ZIF-8 nanocrystals on the surface of CdS.The higeher magnification TEM images are illustrated in Fig. 2e f, they reveal that the thickness of the ZIF-8 shell is about 30 nm.Fig. 2g shows the elemental mapping images of a single CdS/ZIF-8 nanoparticle, which indicates that the Cd and S elements are mainly distributed in the center of the nanoparticle and the Zn is uniformly distributed over the entire nanoparticle, further verifying the core-shell structure of CdS/ZIF-8 composite. The surface chemical states of the samples are analyzed by XPS.Fig. 3a shows the full XPS survey spectra of CdS/ZIF-8 composite, suggesting the existence of S, C, Cd, N, O, and Zn elements in the composite.Although most of the CdS/ZIF-8 nanoparticles have compact core-shell structre, there are inevitably some exposed CdS nanoparticles, leading to the appearance of S and Cd signals in the XPS spectra.The XPS survey spectra of CdS, CdS/ZIF-8 and ZIF-8 are displayed in Fig. S3, which shows that the peaks of CdS/ZIF-8 composite are the combination of those of CdS and ZIF-8.The high-resolution XPS spectra of Zn 2p shows two peaks centered at binding energies of 1021.9 and 1044.9 eV, which are assigned to Zn 2p 3/2 and Zn 2p 1/2 respectively.There are two separated peaks located at binding energies of 404.9 and 411.8 eV, corresponding to Cd 3d 5/2 and Cd 3d 3/2 respectively.The appearance of these two peaks are attributed to the spin orbit splitting of Cd 3d orbital, and the spin orbit separation is 6.9 eV, demonstrating the chemical state of Cd is Cd 2 .The S 2p spectra can be fitted to two peaks at binding energies of 161.2 and 162.4 eV, which are ascribed to S 2p 1/2 and S 2p 3/2 respectively, indicating the existence of S 2-state 34,35. The specific surface area of three samples is investigated by N 2 adsorption-desorption measurements.Fig. 4 shows the measuring results of pure CdS nanoparticles and CdS/ZIF-8 composite while Fig. S4 shows the measuring result of ZIF-8 nanocrystals.The nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms of the three samples are type IV according to the BDDT (Brunauer-Deming-Demin-Teller) classification.In this situation, the isotherms possess hysteresis loop as a result of capillary condensation at high relative pressures.Moreover, the hysteresis loops of all the three samples are H3 type according to the IUPAC classification, indicating the presence of slit-shaped pores due to the aggregation of nanoparticles 36.ZIF-8 is a typical MOFs material with high porosity, low density and high specific surface area.It can be seen from Fig. S4 that the as-synthesized ZIF-8 crystals show extremely high nitrogen adsorption capacity with a BET surface area of 1240.3 m 2 g -1 .As shown in Fig. 4, the nitrogen adsorption of CdS/ZIF-8 composite is much higher compared with pure CdS in the full range mainly because of the high porosity of deposited ZIF-8 crystals.By contrast, the BET surface area of pure CdS is only 13.6 m 2 g -1 , which is much smaller than that of CdS/ZIF-8 composite (74.0 m 2 g -1 ). Fig. 5 shows the CO 2 adsorption isotherms of pure CdS and CdS/ZIF-8 composite.The CO 2 adsorption on both pure CdS and CdS/ZIF-8 composite has linear relationship with pressure in the range of 0-0.1 MPa, indicating the physical adsorption of CO 2 onto the photocatalysts.At 298 K and 0.1 MPa, the maximum CO 2 adsorption for CdS and CdS/ZIF-8 is 0.87 mL/g and 3.08 mL/g respectively.CdS/ZIF-8 composites show an approximately 3.5 times increase in CO 2 adsorption than that of CdS because of the high CO 2 adsorption capability of ZIF-8 (see Fig. S5).The high CO 2 adsorption is benificial for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction. The optical absorption of pure CdS, CdS/ZIF-8 composite and ZIF-8 crystals are investigated by UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (see Fig. 6a).Pure CdS nanoparticles have strong absorption in the UV-vis region and mainly absorb light with wavelength shorter than 550 nm, which is consistent with the previous litreature reports 37.However, ZIF-8 crystals are white powder with the main light absorption in the ultraviolet region and nearly no visible light absorption.Compared with pure CdS nanoparticles, the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of CdS/ZIF-8 composite only change a little, which means the light harvesting ability of CdS/ZIF-8 composite only has a very slight decrease though the spherical CdS is wholly wrapped by ZIF-8 crystals.The band gaps of pure CdS and CdS/ZIF-8 composite are calculated to be 2.42 and 2.41 eV respectively, according to Tauc plots (Fig. 6b).The deposition of ZIF-8 crystals results in little influence on the band structure of CdS nanoparticles.Three-electrode system was used to measure the transient photocurrent responses of CdS and CdS/ZIF-8 composite.The working electrode was made by dip-coating samples onto fluorine-tin oxide (FTO) glasses.0.5 M Na 2 SO 4 aqueous solution served as the electrolyte and a 300 W Xe lamp equipped with a 420 nm cut-off filter was used as the light source.As shown in Fig. 6c d, both CdS and CdS/ZIF-8 composite exhibit photocurrent responses under several onoff cycles of visible light illumination.Interestingly, we found that the initial photocurrent intensity of CdS and CdS/ZIF-8 composite are almost the same, but the photocurrent stability of CdS/ZIF-8 is much better than that of CdS.The photocurrent response of CdS is initially around 2 A, and then decreases continuously under the irradiation of light, consistent with literature data 383940, which attributes the photocurrent decrease of CdS to photocorrosion.By contrast, the photocurrent response of CdS/ZIF-8 appears stable at 2 A, mainly because the core-shell structure of CdS/ZIF-8 can efficiently protect CdS from photocorrosion by stabilizing sulfide and cadmium ions inside the core.As a consequence, CdS/ZIF-8 possesses better photostability compared with CdS. The above characterization results indicate that the modification of ZIF-8 can certainly improve the CO 2 adsorption capability and photocurrent stability of CdS without impairing its light harvesting ability, which tends to bring advantages to the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .The photocatalytic reaction was carried out in a component solvent system (acetonitrile/H 2 O).TEOA and Co(bpy) 3 2 were added as a sacrificial agent and an co-catalyst, respectively.The evolution amounts of CO and H 2 are calculated according to the calibration curves (see Fig. S6 7).Fig. 7a shows the CO evolution over CdS and CdS/ZIF-8 composite under visible light illumination.At the beginning of the light irradiation, there is nearly no CO detected in both CdS and CdS/ZIF-8 photocatalytic system, and that period of CdS/ZIF-8 is even longer than that of CdS.Whether the catalytic active sites are on CdS or on ZIF-8, there is a porous shell between photogenerated electron and most CO 2 molecules, which may inevitably increase the initial reaction time. When CO can be detected, the CO evolution of CdS and CdS/ZIF-8 both increase linearly with the irradiation time.Moreover, the accumulated CO production of CdS/ZIF-8 exceeds that of CdS at 100 min.The improved CO evolution rate of CdS/ZIF-8 can be attributed to its higher CO 2 adsorption capability, which can increase the CO 2 concentration around the catalysts.Different from the CO production, the H 2 evolution of CdS/ZIF-8 is generally lower than that of CdS (see Fig. 7 b), demonstrating that CdS/ZIF-8 has better selectivity towards CO relative to CdS.Fig. 7c shows the CO and H 2 evolution rate on CdS and CdS/ZIF-8 composite.The CO production rates on CdS and CdS/ZIF-8 composite are 26.33 mol h -1 and 32.13 mol h -1 , respectively.In addition, the H 2 evolution rates on CdS and CdS/ZIF-8 composite are 5.77 mol h -1 and 7.09 mol h -1 , respectively.The CO selectivity of CdS/ZIF-8 is around 83.96, higher than that of CdS.The control experiment showed that ZIF-8 exhibited no catalytic activity.When using N 2 as the gas feedstock, only H 2 was generated, confirming that the photogenerated CO comes from the reduced CO 2 .The photostability of CdS/ ZIF-8 composite is further checked by recovering the photocatalysts and repeating the photocatalytic reaction using a fresh solution for 75 min. As shown in Fig. 7d, no obvious decrease of CO evolution is observed after 4 cycles.The CO production of CdS/ZIF-8 composite for the fourth cycle remains at 90 of the initial reaction.The TEM image of the used CdS/ZIF-8 composite is shown in Fig. S8, indicating excellent structure stability of CdS/ZIF-8 NPs.The cycle stability experiment accompanied with the photocurrent measurement reflects the good photostability of CdS/ZIF-8 composite.Compared with previous papers in Table S1, our proposed CO 2 RR photocatalyst exhibits excellent CO 2 reduction performance. To test the impact of the thickness on the photocatalytic performance, samples with various thickness were prepared.It was reported that the thickness of ZIF-8 shell can be controlled by adjusting the concentration of Zn 2 , because Zn 2 can accelerate the growth rate of ZIF-8 nanocrystals 22.Therefore, the CdS/ZIF-8 composites with different ZIF-8 shell thickness were prepared by altering the concentration of Zn 2 .When the concentration of Zn 2 was fixed at 40 mM, the thickness of ZIF-8 shell of the as-obtained composite (CdS/ ZIF-8-40) is about 60 nm, much thicker than that of CdS/ZIF-8 (the Zn 2 concentration was 20 nm).Moreover, when the concentration of Zn 2 was increased to 80 mM, the composite (CdS/ZIF-8-80) possesses multiple-core-shell structures (see Fig. S9).Then the CO 2 photo-reduction performance of the CdS/ZIF-8, CdS/ZIF-8-40 and CdS/ZIF-8-80 composites was investigated.As shown in Fig. 8, the CO evolution on CdS/ZIF-8-40 and CdS/ZIF-8-80 is 13 mol and 9 mol, respectively.By contrast, the CO evolution on CdS/ZIF-8 is around 16 mol.The photoreduction activities of these samples decrease with the increase of ZIF-8 shell thickness, which could be attributed to the stronger barriers between CO 2 and photogenerated electrons caused by thick ZIF-8 shells. Mott-Schottky (M-S) plots were performed to investigate the flat band potential as well as Fermi energy level of semiconductor.As shown in Fig. S10, the observed positive slopes on the M-S plots exhibit the typical n-type characteristics for CdS and CdS/ZIF-8.Based on the intersection points, the flat band potentials of CdS and CdS/ZIF-8 are nearly identical (approximately -0.7 V vs. Ag/AgCl), implying that the ZIF-8 shell has no effect on the semiconductor properties of CdS.In general, the flat band potential of n-type semiconductor (intercept value at the x-axis) can be used to estimate the conduction band (CB) of semiconductor.Therefore, the CB edge position of CdS can be estimated to be -0.78V (vs.Ag/AgCl).Besides, the band baps determined from Tauc plot are 2.38 eV for CdS.Since the CB potential of CdS (-0.7 V vs. Ag/AgCl) is more negative compared with CO 2 /CO (-0.12 V vs. Ag/ AgCl), the photoinduced electrons on the CB potentials of CdS could reduce the adsorbed CO 2 to form CO, while the abundant holes on the VB of CdS are able to oxidize surface-adsorbed TEOA to yield TEOA , as shown in Fig. 9.The core-shell structure of CdS/ZIF-8 can efficiently protect CdS from photocorrosion by stabilizing sulfide and cadmium ions inside the core."

    "content": "In summary, CdS/ZIF-8 composites with core-shell structures are prepared and applied in photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .CdS/ZIF-8 shows higher efficiency and better selectivity in photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 to CO compared with CdS, which is attributed to its higher CO 2 adsorption capability.The modification of ZIF-8 shell can improve the CO 2 adsorption capacity and photostability of CdS without impairing its light harvesting ability.The photostability of CdS/ZIF-8 is verified by photocurrent measurement and cycle stability experiment.There is no obvious decrease in the performance of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction after 4 cycles for CdS/ZIF-8 composites.This work provides a way to construct core-shell semiconductor/MOFs composite with semiconductor as the core and MOFs as the shell, which can combine the advantages of both and improve the optical stability of semiconductors for many applications, such as catalysis, energy conversion and devices.
