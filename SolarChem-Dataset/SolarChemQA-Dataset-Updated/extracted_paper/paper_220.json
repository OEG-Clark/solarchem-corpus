    "content": "Graphite powder was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (cat.332461).All solvents and chemicals were of analytical grade and used without any purication. Graphene oxide (GO-1) was rst prepared using the modied Hummer's method. 30In a typical procedure, 0.5 g graphite powder and 0.375 g NaNO 3 were placed in a 500 ml reaction ask and immersed in an ice bath.Then, 37.5 ml concentrated H 2 SO 4 was added into the above mixture and stirred for 20 min.Subsequently, 2.25 g of KMnO 4 was added slowly into the solution and continuously stirred for another ve days at ambient temperature.Aer that 70 ml diluted H 2 SO 4 (5 wt) was added into the mixture and heated upto 90 C under continuous stirring for 2 h.Then 3 ml H 2 O 2 was added into the solution and stirred for another 2 h under ambient conditions.On completion of the reaction, the mixture was centrifuged (6000 rpm, 10 min) and washed with 400 ml of 3 wt H 2 SO 4 (3 wt), H 2 O 2 (0.5 wt), and HCl (3 wt), and then repeatedly washed with distilled water until the pH of the ltrate became neutral.Finally, the prepared GO was dispersed in distilled water and the homogeneous GO dispersion was then centrifuged and ltered.The as-prepared GO-1 in the ltrates was then collected and dried in a vacuum oven at 40 C overnight prior to the storage in the powder form for further use. In the modied process, for synthesis of GO-2 and GO-3, a 0.5 g graphite powder was suspended in 37.5 ml of H 2 SO 4 by stirring the mixture for 20 min.Subsequently, 85 H 3 PO 4 of desired volume (for GO-2 14 5 ml and GO-3 14 10 ml) was then added, and the mixture was allowed to stir for another 15 min before the addition of KMnO 4 (4.5 g).The reaction mixture was allowed to stir at room temperature for 5 days.Aer that we followed the similar procedure, as described previously. UV-visible absorption spectra for various GO dispersions were collected with a Jasco V-670 spectrophotometer using a 10 mm quartz cell.The microstructure of the GO samples on a gold substrate was investigated by a eld emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, JEOL JSM-6700F).Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of GO-1 and GO-3 were obtained using an AFM-Nano Wizard in tapping mode with a Si tip on the Si/SiO 2 substrate.X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed on a theta probe ESCA VG Scientic (2002) using monochromatic AlKa as the exciting source.The peak positions of the XPS were adjusted carefully with respect to the Au 4f peak because of the insulating character of GO.Finally, the XPS spectra were deconvoluted by using the Voigt tting function aer a Shirley background subtraction procedure.Gas chromatography (GC) analyses were performed on a GC-FID-CHINA CHROMATOGRAPHY 9800 system (glass column Porapak Q (80-100 mesh), inj.temp.110 C, FID temp.150 C and oven temp.130 C).GC-MS analyses were performed on a GC (HP 6890)/MS (HP 5973) system (column-Agilent DB-624, inj.temp.250 C and oven temp.40 C). The photocatalytic experiment for the reduction of CO 2 was performed at ambient temperature (25 AE 5 C) in a continuous gas ow reactor.The volume of the cylindrical reactor which was made of stainless steel and covered with quartz-glass was 300 ml (11 cm A 4 cm).One sample dish containing 0.2 g of catalyst powder was placed in the middle of the reactor.A 300 W commercial halogen lamp was used as the simulated solar-light source.The lamp was vertically placed outside the reactor above the sample dish.Two mini fans were xed around the lamp to avoid the temperature rise of the ow system.The catalyst powder spread onto a glass disc, with a diameter of 7.5 cm.Initially nitrogen gas was purged inside the reactor to remove the air with other gases.Aer that CO 2 was purged inside the reactor for another 1 hour and the ow rate was controlled at 4 sccm.CO 2 was owing through water to control the desired humidity level for the entire experiment.The halogen lamp was turned on aer one hour while adsorption and desorption of the gas and the photocatalyst reached the equilibrium.The concentration of methanol was continuously measured by a GC-FID in the vapor phase.The detailed schematic drawing of the experimental setup is shown in Fig. S1."

    "content": "The most conventional way for GO synthesis follows the modied Hummer's method, 30 where the strong oxidant KMnO 4 induces the oxygenated functional groups on well exfoliated graphite to produce highly dispersible graphene oxide sheets (GO-1).In our modied method GO-2 was prepared in the presence of excess KMnO 4 with H 3 PO 4 as expected; the excess KMnO 4 would raise the level of oxidation and could lead to the overoxidation of the initially produced oxygenated functional groups.Furthermore, the excessive oxidation could result in hole formation and uncontrollable breaking of the edges and basal planes.The mild oxidizer H 3 PO 4 reacts with a small amount of the surface hydroxyl groups via ester formation and hence prevents the GO basal plane from further oxidation.Sequentially, the GO-3 preparation with excess H 3 PO 4 improved the protection of the GO basal plane.A similar phenomenon has been reported by Higginbotham et al. while using the mild oxidizing agent H 3 PO 4 to fabricate graphene oxide nanoribbons from multiwall carbon nanotubes. 31o clarify the properties of the synthesized GO-based materials, UV-visible spectra (normalized) were plotted as shown in Fig. 1.The observed absorption near 200 nm suggests that all the synthesized GO samples possess an ordered graphitic structure with a p / p transition of CC.A small shoulder near 300 nm was observed in all GOs spectra, which is attributed to the n / p transition of CO.The optical band gaps of the three samples, GO-1, GO-2 and GO-3, were determined by using a Tauc plot with a linear extrapolation (Fig. 1).The amorphous GO sheet having a non-uniform oxidation level cannot exhibit sharp adsorption edges in the Tauc plot.We observed an approximate band gap ranges over 2.9-3.7,3.1-3.9and 3.2-4.4for GO-1, GO-2 and GO-3 respectively.These observed approximate band gaps of all the GOs, showing an intrinsic semiconductor like absorption in the blue optical region, are adequately large to overcome the endothermic energy required for the CO 2 reduction (A0.38 V) under solar energy excitation. The morphology and structure of as-prepared graphene oxide samples (GO-1 and GO-3) were investigated via scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).As presented in Fig. 2, the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of GO sheets were cast on a gold coated (100 nm) Si/SiO 2 substrate.All the GO samples were well-exfoliated with a majority of the akes being only a few layers thick and several micrometers in diameter.In the GO-3 sample, we found that the graphene akes have rough surfaces than the GO-1 samples.Furthermore, in the TEM observation (inset, Fig. 2), GO-1 shows a layer-by-layer stacked structure, while GO-3 has wrinkled paper like morphology.Such morphological changes can be attributed to the increased formation of phenolic and epoxy functional groups on the basal plane of GO-3.Topographic images of the GOs are shown in Fig. 3 together with the height proles.AFM images conrm that GO-1 and GO-3 are comprised of isolated few-layer sheets.GO-1 and GO-3 have lateral dimensions of several micrometers and a thickness of 1-3 nm, which is characteristic of a fully exfoliated graphene oxide sheet.Furthermore, we clearly observed from the AFM images that the GO-3 sheet has rougher edges than GO-1.Typical AFM analyses disclose the same morphology of GO-1 and GO-3 as that obtained from the SEM and TEM measurements. The Raman spectroscopic study of three GO samples was conducted using the 514 nm laser.The Raman spectra (Fig. 4) of all the three GO samples exhibited two strong peaks: the G mode, a doubly degenerate phonon mode at the Brillouin zone observed at 1590 cm A1 , originating from in-plane vibration of the sp 2 domain; the D mode arising from the doubly resonant disorder-induced mode at 1341 cm A1 .Moreover, for all the GOs synthesized by the modied Hummer's method, stronger D bands appear in the Raman spectra.Moreover, a very small decrease in the I G /I D intensity ratio (from 0.74 for GO-1 to 0.67 for GO-3) indicates a slight decrease in the in-plane domain size with a minute increase in the sp 3 domain (defect density) with oxygenated functional groups on the GO basal plane of GO.Therefore, the Raman analysis result clearly supports previous microscopic analysis. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement was performed to determine detail compositions and the nature of the functional groups in the as-synthesized GOs.-COOH groups.All the above-mentioned assignment of peak energies are in agreement with the literature values. 32The correlation between the relative peak intensities of the three components (normalized with sp 2 ), as illustrated in Fig. 5d, provides better understanding of the differences in the synthesis process of GO.The inadequate addition of H 3 PO 4 in the preparation of GO-2 could not protect the GO basal plane from over-oxidation as evidenced from the reduced C-O (component 1) intensity, while in GO-3 increasing amounts of H 3 PO 4 improved the protection of the GO basal plane and increased the C-O (component 1) intensity signicantly.On the other hand, the CO and -COOH functional groups associated with components 3 and 4, respectively, were little lower in GO-3 as compared with GO-2. Gas phase photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 was carried out on the synthesized GO materials under ambient conditions using a halogen lamp as the light source.The commercial TiO 2 was separately tested for gas phase photocatalytic CO 2 reduction under the similar conditions.According to the procedure described in the Experimental section, the methanol (MeOH) formation rate, R MeOH (mmol g cat A1 h A1 ), was calculated and plotted in Fig. 6 as a function of reaction time.Activity of the methanol formation was found to follow the order: GO-3 GO-1 GO-2 TiO 2 (P-25).GO-3 displays a moderate methanol conversion rate of 0.172 mmol g cat A1 h A1 at a four-hour reaction time with a better stability.In GO-1 and GO-2 samples, the R MeOH initially increased very fast until it reached the maximum of 0.110 and 0.089 mmol g cat A1 h A1 , respectively, and then it leveled off aer 2 hours of testing, whereas a methanol conversion rate of only 0.03 mmol g cat A1 h A1 was observed with pure TiO 2 (P-25).Additionally, to eliminate the surface area effect on the methanol formation rate, we calculated the methanol conversation rate (mmol per surface cat A1 h A1 ) based on the active sites of GO-3 (53.7 m 2 g A1 ) and TiO 2 (55 m 2 g A1 ). The calculated methanol formation rates were 3.2 A 10 A3 and 0.54 A 10 A3 mmol per surface cat A1 h A1 for GO-3 and TiO 2 , respectively.This analysis supports the previous observation that the photocatalytic CO 2 to methanol conversion rate of the modied graphene oxide (GO-3) is six-fold higher than that of the pure TiO 2 .Using R MeOH as a measure of performance, assynthesized GO-3 has denitely outplayed the TiO 2 , as observed in Fig. 6. Among all GOs, GO-3 exhibits the highest efficiency as a photocatalyst for CO 2 reduction.In general the overall photocatalytic CO 2 reduction mechanism is a sequential combination of H 2 O oxidation and CO 2 reduction.Particularly the valence band (VB) energy position of the photocatalyst for H 2 O oxidation must be greater than the potential for theoretical H 2 O oxidation (0.82 V vs. NHE at pH 14 7).Furthermore, the conduction band (CB) position of the photocatalyst for H 2 O oxidation should be lower than the valance band position of the photocatalyst for CO 2 reduction.The position of the conduction band of GO was calculated according to the cyclic voltammetry data shown in the ESI, Fig. S3. Moreover, the possible photocatalytic mechanism of the GO has been demonstrated for the better understanding of the CO 2 photoreduction process.Chhowalla and Eda 20 have reported that in GO isolated sp 2 clusters with the oxygenated functional groups (C-OH or C-O-C) lead to localization of electron (e A )hole (h ) pairs on its basal plane.Similarly, we assumed in our modied GO with surplus oxygenated components on the basal plane stretching the bandgap energy that helps the electrons excite from the valence band to the conduction band.We propose that in the photocatalytic reduction, the photogenerated electrons (e A ) and holes (h ) would migrate to the GO surface and serve as the oxidizing and reducing sites, respectively, to react with absorbed reactants.The reduction potential of e A in the graphene oxide (GO) conduction band was determined to be A0.79V (vs.NHE), which is lower than the potential of CO 2 /CH 3 OH (A0.38 V vs. NHE) and act as a donor.Whereas the oxidation potential of the h in the GO valance band was estimated (with optical band potential) to be around 4 V (vs.NHE), which is higher than the potential of H 2 O/O 2 , H (E 14 0.82 V vs. NHE) and acts as an acceptor.This indicates that the photogenerated electrons and holes on the irradiated GO can react with the adsorbed CO 2 and H 2 O to produce CH 3 OH via six-electron reaction, as described in eqn ( 1)-(3) in Fig. 7.The conduction band position (A0.79V) of GO supports that the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction on GO is less feasible for the one electron reduction process (E 14 A1.90 V) as compared to a multi-electron process.In our CO 2 photo-reduction process, only CH 3 OH was detected, although there are possibilities for the formation of other products such as CO, HCHO and CH 4 .The photocatalytic performance data, herein, potentially support our hypothetical interpretations of the CO 2 reduction mechanism. To conrm the chemical stability of GOs we conducted XPS analysis of GO-1, GO-2 and GO-3 aer photocatalytic reaction as shown in Fig. S4. XPS spectra of GOs showed negligible changes in the oxygenated functional groups as a result of irradiation.It was observed that all GO C1s spectra contain three components corresponding to sp 2 -hybridized (CC), C-O and CO functional groups.During the photocatalytic process, the oxygenated -COOH groups were removed from the GO edges, narrowing the bandgap.The correlation between the relative peak intensities of the C-O and CO components (normalized with sp 2 ), as illustrated in Fig. S4d, shows negligible changes in the GO samples aer photocatalytic reaction as compared with the pristine samples before the photocatalytic reaction.Moreover, major parts of the oxygenated functional groups remain chemically stable during irradiation to sustain the critical bandgap of the GO for the photocatalytic reaction.Under these circumstances, the loss of a small number of oxygenated functional groups from the GO during irradiation only affect initial (upto 2 h) methanol formation, aer that the catalyst became stable during the photocatalytic reaction.Additionally, to eliminate the possibility of GO as one of the major methanol source, we conducted the isotope tracer analyses of GOs with 13 CO 2 as described below. In order to conrm the methanol formation through CO 2 reduction, instead of photo-dissociation of GOs, isotope tracer analyses with 13 CO 2 was performed.We observed the distinct peak associated with 13 CH 3 OH (m/z 33) instead of 12 CH 3 OH (m/z 32), while replacing 12 CO 2 by 13 CO 2 , for photocatalytic reduction with GO-3 in a closed system under irradiation for two hours (mass chromatography results, Fig. 8).These data conrmed that methanol was produced directly from the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 instead of any photo-dissociation of the carbon containing catalyst."
