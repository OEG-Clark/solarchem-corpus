    "content": "Herein, we report the facile synthesis of uniform perovskite hydroxide CoSn(OH) 6 nanocubes and their first use as noble-metal-free, highly efficient and stable catalysts for the deoxygenative reduction of CO 2 to CO with visible light.The CoSn(OH) 6 sample is synthesized through a one-pot co-precipitation method and fully characterized by various techniques including XRD, FTIR, FESEM, TEM, EDX, EDX-mappings, XPS, DRS, and N 2 sorption measurements.The CoSn(OH) 6 solid is found by theoretical calculations to be capable of absorbing and activating CO 2 molecules on the (100) surface.Under the optimal reaction conditions, the CoSn(OH) 6 catalyst exhibits a high CO 2 reduction activity with visible light irradiation, affording a CO generation rate of 18.7 mol h -1 .The stability and reusability of the CoSn(OH) 6 catalyst for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction are solidly confirmed.Results of in situ photoluminescence spectroscopy and photocurrent response characterizations indicate that the CoSn(OH) 6 catalyst can efficiently promote the separation and transfers of photoexcited charge carriers during photocatalysis, and eventually leading to obviously enhanced CO 2 photoreduction performance.Moreover, a possible mechanism for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction is also proposed based on the results of activity evaluation and photo-/electro-chemical measurements."

    "content": "A Bruker D8 Advance instrument (Cu K 1 irradiation, 1.5406A) was used to collect the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of samples.The accelerating voltage and the applied current were 40 KV and 40 mA, respectively.Data were recorded at a scanning rate of 0.022 s -1 in the 2 region of 15-80.A Hitachi New Generation SU8010 field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM) was employed to capture the FEMSEM images and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrum.Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements were conducted using a JEOL model JEM 2010 EX instrument at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV with the sample supported on a copper grid.X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterizations were carried out on a PHI Quantum 2000 XPS system with a monochromatic Al K source and a charge neutralizer.The X-ray photoelectron spectra of all of the elements were referenced to the C 1s peak arising from adventitious carbon (its binding energy was set at 284.6 eV).Specific surface area and pore size distribution curve of the samples were determined from the results of N 2 sorption measurements at 77 K (Micromeritics ASAP 2020) by using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) methods.UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) spectra were obtained on a Varian Cary 500 UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer with BaSO 4 as a reflectance standard.The absorbance spectrum of the Ru-dye solution was recorded by a Varian Cary 50 UV-vis spectrophotometer.Mott-Schottky measurements were conducted on a Zenuium electrochemical workstation (Zahner Co.).The measurements were performed in a conventional three electrodes cell using Pt plate and Ag/AgCl electrode as the counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively.For Mott-Schottky experiment, the potential ranged from -0.4 to 0.1 V (vs.Ag/ AgCl), and the frequency were 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 kHz, respectively.Prior to all measurements, the electrolyte (0.2 M Na 2 SO 4 aqueous solution) was purged with nitrogen gas for 30 min. Gas chromatographic (GC) analysis was conducted using an Agilent 7820A gas chromatography equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a TD-01 packed column.High purity Ar was used as the carrier gas.The oven temperature was set constant at 50 C, and the inlet and detector temperature were set at 120 C and 200 C, respectively.A HP 5973 GC-MS was used to analyze the products of the 13 CO 2 isotopic experiment. Periodic first-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) were carried out using the projector-augmented wave (PAW) formalism.The generalized gradient approximation Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) type exchange-correlation was adopted.The kinetic cut-off energy for the plane-wave expansion was set to 400 eV, and a (3 3 1) Monkhorst-Pack k-point grid was used.The effects of spin polarization were considered and the dipole correction in the surface normal direction was applied.To properly describe the electron correlation of partially occupied Co 3d states, the PBE plus on-site repulsion U (PBE U) method was adopted.In here, the PBE U calculations were carried out following the simplified rotationally invariant form proposed by Dudarev to address the self-interaction energy, and the effective single parameter U-J of 3.0 eV was used for Co atom.The convergence thresholds of the energy change and the maximum force for the geometry optimizations were set to 10 -5 eV and 0.05 eV/A, respectively. To perform the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reactions, CoSn(OH) 6 (3.6 mol) and Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 6H 2 O (10 mol, abbreviated as Ru) were added into a Schlenk flask reactor (80 ml in capacity) containing a mixture of TEOA/water/acetonitrile (1 ml/2 ml/3 ml).High purity CO 2 was introduced to the reactor with a partial pressure of 1 atm.The CO 2 reduction reactions were carried out at 30 C controlled by circulating water using a 300 W Xe lamp with a 420 nm cut-off filter as the light source under energetically stirring.After reaction for specific reactiontime, the yields of products were determined by the Agilent 7820A gas chromatography."

    "content": "The crystallographic structure and the phase purity of the CoSn (OH) 6 material were first studied by powder XRD.As shown in Fig. 1a, all the diffraction peaks of the synthesized CoSn(OH) 6 sample can be exactly indexed to a perovskite hydroxide phase (JCPDS card No.: 13-0356) 36, and the corresponding crystal structure of perovskite hydroxide CoSn(OH) 6 is illustrated in the insert in Fig. 1a.The sharp diffraction peaks reflect the high crystallinity of the sample.No other diffraction peaks are observed, indicating the phase purity of the CoSn (OH) 6 material.The chemical structures of the CoSn(OH) 6 sample are investigated by FTIR spectroscopy.In the FTIR spectrum (Fig. 1b), the broad band at 3208 cm -1 and the small pinnacle at 1638 cm -1 are designated to the stretching vibration and bending vibration of OeH bond, respectively 37,38.The stretching vibration of SneO bond and the bending vibration of SneOH bond are correspondingly located at around 541 and 1177 cm -1 37,38.The strong band at 778 cm -1 signifies the H 2 OeH 2 O hydrogen bonding 37,38.All the observation of XRD and FTIR measurements reveals that the crystal and chemical structures of perovskite hydroxide of CoSn(OH) 6 material are well developed 37,39,40. FESEM and TEM were used to examine the morphology of the CoSn (OH) 6 material.The low magnification FESEM image shows that the as-synthesized CoSn(OH) 6 sample is consisted of uniform nanocubes without noticeable impurity particles or aggregates (Fig. 2a).The magnified FESEM image reveals that the average diameter of the nanocubes is ca.200 nm with a smooth surface (Fig. 2b).TEM image presents the edge view of an individual CoSn(OH) 6 nanocube (Fig. 2c), and the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images display the visible lattice fringes (Inserts in Fig. 2c).The interplanar distance is determined to be ca.0.385 and 0.444 nm, which corresponds to the (200) and (111) crystal planes of perovskite hydroxide CoSn(OH) 6 , respectively.The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern displays the regular array of diffraction spots (Fig. 2d), indicating the CoSn(OH) 6 nanocubes are single-crystalline 35.The crystal structure of the as-prepared CoSn (OH) 6 sample revealed by TEM tests is in line with the results of XRD characterization.The chemical composition of the CoSn(OH) 6 sample is examined by EDX spectroscope.As shown in Fig. 2e, only signal peaks of Co, Sn and O elements are detected, which further suggests the high purity of the CoSn(OH) 6 solid.Results of EDX elemental mappings confirm that all the composition elements are homogeneously distributed in the entire nanocube (Fig. 2f). In order to study the surface chemical state of the elements in CoSn (OH) 6 sample, XPS characterizations are conducted.As revealed in Fig. 3a, the wide range XPS survey spectrum confirms the synthesized CoSn(OH) 6 material is composed of Co, Sn and O elements, which is in agreement with the results of EDX tests.Fig. 3b presents the Co 2p highresolution XPS spectrum.The two peaks positioned at ca. 781.3 and 797.6 eV are assigned to Co 2p 3/2 and Co 2p 1/2 , respectively 37,41.The characteristic shakeup satellite peak is located at 785.9 eV, which normally results from either the excitation of multielectron (shakeup) or the coupling between the unpaired electrons (multiplet splitting) 37,41.Typically, the satellite peak of Co(III) is entirely absent, and the intensity of satellite peak in case of Co 3 O 4 i.e., Co(II) and Co(III) is very low.Thus, the strong intensity of the satellite peak indicates that the Co element holds the oxidation state of 2 in the CoSn(OH) 6 sample 37,39,41.In the high resolution XPS spectrum of Sn 3d (Fig. 3c), the high intense peak with a binding energy of ca.485.2 eV is Sn 3d 5/2 and the peak located at 493.7 eV is Sn 3d 3/2 .The peak splitting of Sn 3d is 8.5 eV, suggesting Sn is in a chemical state of Sn(IV) 37,41.The O 1s high resolution XPS spectrum can be divided into three photoelectron peaks at 532.2, 530.6, and 528.5 eV (Fig. 3d), assigning to the oxygen of physically adsorbed water molecules, the lattice oxygen in perovskite hydroxide structure, and the oxygen of hydroxide ions, respectively 6,37,41. The specific surface area and the pores size distribution of the CoSn (OH) 6 nanocubes are investigated by N 2 sorption measurements.As shown in Fig. 4, the N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms can be categorized as type IV with a type H1 hysteresis loop, pointing to the mesoporous characteristics.The BET specific surface area is calculated to be ca.75 m 2 g -1 .The pore size distribution curve (Insert in Fig. 4) indicates that the CoSn(OH) 6 nanocubes hold a pore size distribution of 2-16 nm with an average pore diameter of 3.5 nm.The presence of these mesopores is typically favorable to provide more catalytic-active sites, promote CO 2 adsorption and concentration, and facilitate mass/ charge transfers, and eventually enhance the performance of CO 2 reduction catalysis 6,28,42. To gain insights into the adsorption and activation behaviors of CO 2 molecules on the CoSn(OH) 6 surface, periodic first-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) are carried out.Fig. 5a shows the crystal structure of CoSn(OH) 6 , and the corresponding (100) surface is modeled by periodic slab consisting of five atomic layers.During the structural optimization, the atoms at the outermost three layers are fully relaxed in all directions, while other atoms at the remaining two layers are fixed to their bulk positions.The spacing between the adjacent slabs is set to about 15 A. After considering several arrangements of CO 2 molecule on the CoSn(OH) 6 (100) surface, the most stable chemisorption structure is determined.As displayed in Fig. 5b, CO 2 molecule is adsorbed on the surface by two oxygen and carbon atoms, and three adsorption bonds, including CeO, CoeO and SneO bonds are found at the interface.The lengths of CoeO and SneO bonds are about 2.060, and 2.231 A, respectively.After adsorption, with respect to the case in the gas phase, two CeO bonds of CO 2 are stretched about 0.10, and 0.12 A, respectively, and meanwhile CO 2 moiety exhibits a bent configuration with the OeCeO angle of 127.1.Since after adsorption the CO 2 exhibits a bent configuration like that of CO 2 -anion, the activation of carbon dioxide can be realized on the CoSn(OH) 6 (100) surface. Catalytic performance of the CoSn(OH) 6 nanocubes is evaluated by visible light driven CO 2 photoreduction reactions operated in H 2 Oacetonitrile mixture under mild reaction conditions (30 C, 1 atm CO 2 ) with Ru and triethanolamine (TEOA) as a photosensitizer and an electron donor, respectively.Fig. 6a shows the performance of CO 2 reduction catalysis under various reaction conditions.Under the typical conditions for 1 h reaction, the stable CO 2 molecules are photosplit into CO with a high generation of 18.7 mol, coupled with a H 2 evolution of 3.0 mol from the CO 2 reduction system.However, once without CoSn (OH) 6 nanocubes as the catalyst for the system, the production of both CO (0.5 mol) and H 2 (0.6 mol) is substantially decreased.Besides, the selectivity of CO is also greatly reduced (Fig. 6a,Insert).These results strongly highlight the considerable catalytic efficiency of the perovskite hydroxide material for enhancing the CO 2 -to-CO conversion reaction in the developed catalytic system.No other CO 2 reduction products (e.g., CH 4 , CH 3 OH, HCOOH) are detected from the reaction system, which is consistent with the results of reported works 11,12,21,27.The control experiment using N 2 as the feedstock gas demonstrates that only a small amount of H 2 is generated, but without any formation of CO.This observation indicates that the CO product is originated from the CO 2 reactant.To further provide solid proof for the carbon source of CO, 13 CO 2 isotope experiment is carried out.As shown in Fig. 6b, only 13 CO with a m/z value of 29 is detected when using 13 CO 2 as the feedstock gas, which firmly validates that the CO formation is generated from the splitting of CO 2 molecules.The production of CO and H 2 is greatly influenced by the ratio of H 2 O in the reaction solvent (Fig. S1, Supplementary materials), consistent with the results of reported works 6,7. When the CO 2 reduction reactions are performed in absence of Ru photosensitizer or in dark (Fig. 6a), the reaction system is completely inactive to produce any product, which is a strong indication that the CO 2 conversion reaction proceeds by visible light irradiation.Furthermore, the performance of the catalytic system is also explored by light illumination of different wavelength.As displayed in Fig. 6c, it is found that the trend of CO/H 2 evolution matches well with the absorption spectrum of the ruthenium complex.This result confirms that CO 2 conversion reaction is operated photocatalytically by light absorption of the dye photosensitizer 6,9,12, producing excited charges for operating the subsequent redox reactions in the tandem catalytic CO 2 reduction system.Studies on the reaction time demonstrate that the reaction system affords a high CO generation rate in the first 1 h reaction (Fig. 6d).Thereafter, the system gradually loses its high catalytic activity, due mainly to photobleaching of the Ru dye after limited catalytic runs, which is commonly observed in dye-sensitized photochemical reaction systems 28,30,43,44, but the CoSn(OH) 6 catalyst is considered to be stable to preserve its intrinsic catalytic performance.To confirm this, after photoirradiation for 1 h, fresh photosensitizer is added into the system for concessive reactions.As shown in Fig. 7a, the CO production reduced slightly and the yield of H 2 progressively improved in the first 4 runs.The reason for this observation is that the degradation of Ru photosensitizer generates ruthenium species to act as a H 2 -evolving catalyst 12.In the fifth run, both yields of CO and H 2 diminish with addition of excessive amount of ruthenium complex, mainly because of the light-shielding effect 12. Meanwhile, to further examine its stability, after photocatalysis the CoSn(OH) 6 catalyst is filtrated, washed and reused for repeated reactions.As demonstrated in Fig. 7b, no obvious deactivation is found in five repeated operations.In the stability test, the total generation of the products is ca.107 mol, corresponding a catalytic turnover number (TON) of about 30 relative to CoSn(OH) 6 catalyst for the CO 2 reduction ststem.This TON value is comparable to reported data 6,28,45,46. In addition, after photocatalytic reactions, the used CoSn(OH) 6 catalyst is removed and further characterized by XRD (Fig. 8a) and XPS (Fig. 8b,c).The results indicate that no noticeable change in crystal and surface structures is observed between the used and fresh CoSn(OH) 6 samples.All these findings solidly highlight the high stability and reusability of the perovskite hydroxide CoSn(OH) 6 material for CO 2 reduction catalysis in the photoredox system. To explore the reaction mechanism of the CO 2 reduction reactions, the flat band potential of CoSn(OH) 6 material is determined by Mott-Schottky analysis.As presented in Fig. 9a, the flat band potential of the CoSn(OH) 6 catalyst is calculated to be ca.-0.62 V (vs.NHE), which is lower than the redox potential of E(Ru(bpy) 3 2 /Ru(bpy) 3 ) -1.09V (vs.NHE) 47 and higher than that of E(CO 2 /CO) -0.53V (vs.NHE) 48,49.Therefore, the CoSn(OH) 6 catalyst possesses the appropriate redox potential to accept the excited electrons from the reduced Ru complex to run the CO 2 -to-CO reduction reaction.Meanwhile, to demonstrate the efficient charge transfers of the CO 2 reduction system, in situ PL measurements are performed.As shown in Fig. 9b, the existence of CoSn(OH) 6 catalyst can obviously inhibit the recombination of photoexcited charge carriers of the catalytic CO 2 conversion system, suggesting that the CoSn(OH) 6 catalyst can indeed effectively accelerate charge migration for CO 2 reduction photocatalysis.In addition, the results of PL-decay analysis (Fig. S2, Supplementary materials) and transient photocurrent responses (Fig. S3, Supplementary materials) further support the function of CnSn(OH) 6 catalyst for promoting charge transfer kinetics of the CO 2 photoreduction system.Based on the above results of photocatalytic evaluation and photo-/electro-chemical measurements, a possible reaction mechanism is thus proposed as follows (Scheme 1).Under visible light irradiation, the Ru photosensitizer is activated to the excited state, which is then reductively quenched by TEOA serving as sacrificial electron donor, forming the reduced photosensitizer.The reduced photosensitizer transfers electrons to the CoSn(OH) 6 solid to operate subsequent reduction reactions.Finally, the CO 2 molecules absorbed on the surface of CoSn(OH) 6 catalyst are reduced to CO.In the meantime, the excited electrons could also reduce the proton existed in the system to generate H 2 ."
