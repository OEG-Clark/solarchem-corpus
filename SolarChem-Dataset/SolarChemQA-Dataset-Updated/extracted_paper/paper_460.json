    "content": "Reactions of ZrCl 4 and metal complexes H 2 L 1 AH 2 L 6 in N,N 0dimethylformamide (DMF) failed to produce crystalline UiO frameworks, presumably due to the steric demand of the L 1 AL 6 ligands.Structure modeling studies indicated that the steric bulk of the L 1 AL 6 ligands precluded the formation of UiO frameworks based on Zr 6 O 4 (OH) 4 (CO 2 ) 12 SBUs and pure L 1 AL 6 ligands.We hypothesized that the L 1 AL 6 ligands could instead be doped into the framework of UiO-67 (Zr 6 ( 3 -O) 4 -( 3 AOH) 4 (bpdc) 6 ) by taking advantage of matching ligand lengths between bpdc and L 1 AL 6 .Such a substitution strategy not only can allow for the incorporation of a sterically demanding bridging ligand into a parent framework but also allows for Journal of the American Chemical Society ARTICLE retention of the porosity of the parent framework to facilitate substrate diffusion for efficient catalysis. Metal complex doped UiO-67 (MOFs 1A6) with the Zr 6 -( 3 -O) 4 ( 3 -OH) 4 (bpdc) 6Ax (L) x formula were synthesized by treating ZrCl 4 with a combination of H 2 bpdc and ligands H 2 L 1 A H 2 L 6 in DMF at 100 C (Scheme 1).Crystallinity of the MOFs could be enhanced by adding acetic acid to the reaction mixture, which presumably stabilized soluble Zr 4 species by acetate coordination and slowed down the formation of amorphous zirconium oxides/hydroxides.Synthetic conditions were optimized to obtain highly crystalline powdery samples of MOFs 1A6 (Supporting Information SI), which are isostructural with the parent framework UiO-67, based on the similarity of their powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns (Figures 1a and1c).SEM images of the samples showed intergrown nanocrystals of 200 nm in dimensions (Figure 1b and Figure S3 SI).Metal complex contents in MOFs 1A6 were established by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis.MOFs 1A6 were found to contain 2A8 wt of the L 1 AL 6 ligands (Table 1).The formulas Zr 6 ( 3 -O) 4 ( 3 -OH) 4 (bpdc) 6Ax (L) x of MOFs 1A6 were supported by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), showing 61A63 weight loss for the organic linkers (Figure S4 SI).Permanent porosities of MOFs 1A6 were demonstrated by N 2 adsorption at 77 K (Figure 1d).Type I isotherms were obtained for all of the six MOFs with BET surface areas ranging from 1092 to 1497 m 2 /g, indicating microporous structures (Table 1).Pore size distribution (calculated by the HK method) centering at 6.7 A perfectly agrees with that of the structure model (Figure S5 SI). Water Oxidation Catalysis Using MOFs 1A3.Water oxidation catalytic activities of MOFs 1A3 were examined with Ce 4 (cerium ammonium nitrate, CAN) as an oxidant (Figure 2a).As shown in Table 2, MOFs 1A3 are highly effective water oxidation catalysts with turnover frequencies (TOFs) as high as 4.8 h A1 .The catalytic activity must come from the doped L 1 AL 3 since the parent UiO-67 did not catalyze water oxidation.The heterogeneous nature of MOFs 1A3 was verified by the reusability of MOFs 1A3 for water oxidation (Figure 2b) and the lack of catalytic activity for the supernatants of the water oxidation mixtures (Figure 2c), which contained no Ir as determined by ICP-MS.Furthermore, the solids recovered from the reactions exhibited the same PXRD patterns as those of the pristine MOFs 1A3 (Figure 2d), supporting the stability of the UiO-67 framework under the present water oxidation conditions.Journal of the American Chemical Society Comparisons of water oxidation TOFs for MOFs 1A3 to those of corresponding homogeneous catalysts H 2 L 1 AH 2 L 3 provide important insights into the reaction processes.MOFs gave lower TOFs than their homogeneous counterparts (only 6.4A12.9 of the homogeneous catalyst activities, Table 2).This level of activity can be accounted for by the Ir catalysts on the MOF particle surface.CAN is apparently too large (11.3A in diameter for the cerium nitrate anions from the crystal structure of CAN) to enter the MOF channels (6.7 A in diameter). A surface poisoning experiment was performed to shed light on the low activity of the MOF catalysts.We first found that treatment of the homogeneous Ir(Cp)(ppy)Cl catalyst with triphenylphosphine (PPh 3 ) effectively shut down the WOC activity.We isolated the new Ir complex Ir(Cp)(ppy)-(PPh 3 )Cl by treating Ir(Cp)(ppy)Cl with triphenylphosphine in ethylacetate at rt for 6 h.The Ir(Cp)(ppy)(PPh 3 )Cl complex was an inactive WOC, exhibiting a negligible WOC activity of less than 1/30 of that of the parent Ir(Cp)(ppy)Cl complex (Figure S7 SI).The coordination of PPh 3 apparently prevents the water coordination to the Ir center which is key to the water oxidation reaction.We then proceeded to carry out the poisoning experiment on MOF 1 with PPh 3 .After being treated with PPh 3 , MOF 1 completely lost its WOC activity (Figure S8 SI).Considering the much larger size of PPh 3 than the pore size of the MOF 1, the PPh 3 molecules can only have access to the Ir sites near the surface of the MOF particles, leading to selective surface poisoning of the WOC.The complete shutdown of the WOC activity can only occur if the Ce 4 -driven water oxidation reactions exclusively take place near the surface of the MOF particles.This set of control experiments thus unambiguously demonstrated that the MOF catalysts exhibit a lower WOC activity than the homogeneous counterparts due to the inability of the CAN molecules to enter the MOF channels. Total WOC turnover numbers of MOFs 1A3 were determined from UVAvis absorption of the residual Ce 4 ions after water oxidation reactions of 12 days.The oxygen sensor can accurately detect O 2 in the gas phase only for a few hours and is not suitable for the longer time-scale experiments.A control experiment using the undoped UiO-67 MOF in the 12-day reactions showed no significant change of the concentration of Ce 4 , confirming the validity of this method.The TONs were estimated to be 1513, 1312, and 2152 for MOFs 1A3, respectively. We do not believe that the water oxidation activity of MOFs 1A3 comes from IrO 2 nanoparticles that could result from the decomposition of H 2 L 1 AH 2 L 3 .Control experiments using presynthesized IrO 2 nanoparticles under the same conditions used with the MOFs indicated that the IrO 2 nanoparticles were a highly active WOC with a TOF of 150 h A1 .However, the IrO 2 nanoparticles were unstable under the reaction conditions with their catalytic activity lasting for less than 30 min.The addition of more Ce 4 to the reaction mixture did not produce more O 2 .The facts that the MOF catalysts could be reused and MOFs 1A3 each exhibited different water oxidation activity also argue against the possibility that in situ generated IrO 2 nanoparticles are responsible for water oxidation.The complete poisoning of MOF 1 by PPh 3 also supported the molecular origin of the WOC activity in the MOFs.X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic analyses of the fresh and recovered MOFs were inconclusive, as the Ir 4f binding energies of the L 1 AL 3 ligands were too close to those of IrO 2 (Figure S6 SI). Photocatalytic CO 2 Reduction Using MOF 4. The Re-based L 4 ligand can serve as an active catalyst for photochemical CO 2 reduction.Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity of MOF 4 was examined in CO 2 -saturated acetonitrile (MeCN), using triethylamine (TEA) as a sacrificial reducing agent.Immediately after irradiating the reaction mixture, the MOF 4 color changed from orange to green, suggestive of catalytic turnovers.As shown in Table 3, the MOF catalyst selectively reduced CO 2 to CO under light, as determined by gas chromatography (GC).Under the reaction conditions (MeCN/TEA 20/1, regular MeCN and TEA, saturated with CO 2 gas), the molar ratio of the CO and H 2 production was around 10 during the first six hours.When the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was carried out with CD 3 CN as the solvent, no formic acid or methanol product was detected by 1 H NMR spectroscopy.The CO-TONs reached 5.0 after the first six hours (Table 3, entry 1).No CO generation was observed in the absence of CO 2 under the same reaction conditions (Table 3, entry 12), ruling out the possibility that the detected CO could Journal of the American Chemical Society ARTICLE have resulted from the decomposition of the L 4 ligand.The photocatalytic nature of the reaction was proved by the fact that no CO was generated in the dark (Table 3, entry 13).The inactivity of the parent UiO-67 framework in this reaction confirmed that the Re I (dcbpy)(CO) 3 Cl moiety was responsible for the catalytic CO 2 reduction (Table 3, entry 14).We also tested the recyclability of the MOF 4 catalyst in lightdriven CO 2 reduction.The solid in the reaction mixture was recovered via centrifugation and reused in additional runs of catalytic reactions.However, after two six-hour reaction runs, the catalyst became inactive in CO generation, but a small amount of H 2 was still detected (Table 3, entries 2 and 3).The supernatant of the MOF 4 reaction mixture showed no CO generation activity but slight H 2 generation activity (Table 3, entry 4).The total CO-TON of the MOF 4 catalyst was estimated to be 10.9 from the 20 h reaction (Table 3, entry 5).During the 20 h reaction, 43.6 of the Re had leached into the supernatant, as determined by ICP-MS.In contrast, only 3.5 of the Zr was detected in the supernatant by ICP-MS.PXRD of the recovered solid indicated that the framework structure of MOF 4 remained intact (Figure 3c).These results suggest that the Re leached into solution via the detachment of Re-carbonyl moieties from the dcbpy group in the MOF 4 framework and not by MOF 4 dissolution.Consistent with this, the recovered MOF 4 lost the UVAvis peak at 412 nm that is characteristic of the 1 MLCT absorption of the Re(CO) 3 (bpy)Cl species (Figure 3d).The intensities of the IR peaks corresponding to the CO stretching vibrations of the L 4 ligand at 2025 cm A1 (A 0 ), 1923 cm A1 (A 0 ), and 1900 cm A1 (A 00 ) significantly decreased in the recovered solid when compared to those of the as-synthesized MOF 4 (Figure 3b), further supporting the decomposition of the L 4 ligand by losing the Re-carbonyl moieties. Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was also conducted with the homogeneous ligand L 4 under the same conditions.Upon irradiation, the reaction mixture also turned from orange to green color immediately.After a six hour reaction, the solution color turned to yellowish gray, and GC analysis indicated a moderate CO-TON of 2.5 (Table 3, entry 6).The reaction mixture was almost inactive in the second photocatalytic run, even after resaturating the solution with CO 2 (Table 3, entry 7).Adding more TEA to the solution did not regenerate the catalytic activity (Table 3, entry 8).All of these observations indicated that the Re L 4 ligand decomposed during the catalytic turnovers.The overall CO-TON for the homogeneous H 2 L 4 ligand was estimated to be 3.5 based on the 20 h reaction (Table 3, entry 9).A time-dependent catalytic activity experiment was performed by analyzing the CO production at different time points by GC (Figure 3a).Although the homogeneous H 2 L 4 was more active than the MOF 4 catalyst in the first two hours, the MOF 4 catalyst retained activity over a longer reaction time to yield a higher total TON.The MOF 4 catalyst thus exhibited much higher total TONs than the homogeneous system, presumably as a result of the catalyst stabilization by the MOF framework.Reactions using Re(CO) 3 (bpy)Cl as catalyst were performed to test our experimental setup and reaction conditions (Table 3, entries 10 and 11).A total TON of 7.0 was obtained after 20 h of irradiation, which is comparable to the previously reported value. 69revious mechanistic studies on the Re(CO) 3 (bpy)Cl-catalyzed CO 2 reduction suggested both a unimolecular pathway involving a Re I (bpy)(CO) 3 (COOH) intermediate 83 and a bimolecular pathway involving a CO 2 -bridged Re dimer (CO) 3 (bpy)Re I (CO 2 )Re I (bpy)(CO) 3 84,85 or outer-sphere redox reactions between two Re molecules 69 in the catalytic cycle.The present MOF 4 catalyzed CO 2 reduction can only occur via the unimolecular mechanism as a result of the immobilization of the L 4 catalyst in the MOF framework.Interestingly, the incorporation of L 4 into the MOF 4 framework not only led to higher CO 2 reduction TONs but also shed light on the CO 2 reduction reaction mechanisms and photocatalyst decomposition pathways. Photocatalytic Organic Transformations using MOF 5 and MOF 6. Catalytic activities of Ir(ppy) 2 (bpy) -based MOF 5 and Ru(bpy) 3 2 -based MOF 6 toward photocatalytic aza-Henry reactions were evaluated with tetrahydroisoquinoline (1a) as the amine substrate and CH 3 NO 2 as solvent.The reaction was carried out in the presence of air with a common fluorescent lamp (26 W) as the light source.The reaction was stopped after 12 h, and the MOF catalysts were filtered off.Conversions of the reactions were determined by integrating the peaks of 1 H NMR spectra of the crude reaction mixtures (SI).As shown in Table 4 (entry 1), both MOF 5 and MOF 6 were highly effective photocatalysts for the aza-Henry reaction between 1a and nitromethane, with 59 and 86 conversions, respectively.The MOF 5 and MOF 6 catalysts also effectively catalyzed the aza-Henry reactions between nitromethane and bromo-and methoxy-substituted tetrahydroisoquinoline (2a and 3a) with high efficiency (Table 4, entries 2 and 3).A number of control experiments were carried out to demonstrate the heterogeneous and photocatalytic nature of the reactions.The reaction of 1a in the dark yielded negligible amounts of aza-Henry products (5), demonstrating the necessity of light in this reaction.On the other hand, the background reaction in the absence of the catalysts but in the presence of light showed only 19 conversion after 12 h (Table 4, entry 1), indicating that the MOF played a catalytic role in the reactions.These observations are consistent with those of the homogeneous catalytic system reported by Stephenson and co-workers. 74In addition, a crossover experiment was carried out to prove the heterogeneity of the MOF catalyst.Substrate 3a was first used in the MOF 6 catalyzed aza-Henry reaction, and 95 conversion was achieved after 12 h.The MOF catalyst was then removed by filtering through Celite, and another substrate 1a was added to the supernatant solution.After stirring the solution under light for 12 h, only 22 conversion was observed for the second substrate.This low conversion, comparable to that of the background reaction, proved that the supernatant of the MOF 6 reaction mixture is inactive in photocatalysis, supporting the heterogeneous nature of the MOF photocatalysts.A further examination of the supernatant by ICP-MS showed no observable leaching of Ru to the solution during the reaction.The MOF 5 and 6 catalysts were also recovered from the reaction mixture by centrifugation and reused three times without loss of activity (Table 5).In addition, PXRD patterns of MOF 5 and 6 after the reactions showed no deterioration of the crystallinity (Figure 4). We performed another control experiment to demonstrate the need of MOF permanent porosity in catalyzing the photodriven aza-Henry reaction.Amorphous nanoparticles were synthesized under conditions similar to those of MOF 6 except that wet DMF was used in the synthesis and glacial acetic acid was not added.The resultant material was nonporous as indicated by N 2 adsorption measurement (with a negligible BET surface area of 46 m 2 /g, Figure S19 SI) and amorphous by PXRD (Figure S20 SI).The L 6 ligand weight percentage in this material was found to be higher than that of MOF 6 by ICP-MS measurements (7.0 wt ).However, the nonporous nanoparticles did not catalyze the aza-Henry reaction using 1a as the substrate (18 conversion, corresponding to background reaction) at the same catalyst loading as MOF 6.This observation unambiguously supported that the photoredox step of the reaction happened inside the channels of MOF 5 and MOF 6.Although the substrate amines are relatively large compared to the size of channels in these MOFs, it is still possible for them to move through the MOF channels as a result of favorable interactions between the amine substrates and the MOF framework (e.g., A stacking interactions). 86Alternatively, it is possible that the aza-Henry reaction can be mediated by photochemically generated singlet oxygen, 87 which will allow the photocatalysis with substrates much larger than the open channels since only O 2 molecules need to diffuse through the MOF channels.As surface photocatalytic sites of these systems have minor contributions to the overall photocatalysis (12 as indicated by the water oxidation activity shown above), microporosity is a prerequisite for the high activity of these doped MOFs.Journal of the American Chemical Society We also demonstrated the applicability of the Ru(bpy) 3 2based MOF 6 as a photocatalyst in other light-driven reactions.As shown in Table 6, MOF 6 efficiently catalyzed aerobic oxidative coupling of a series of primary amines with 46A90 conversions in three hours (Table 6, entries 1, 6, and 7).The conversion of substrate 1c using the MOF 6 was comparable to that using the homogeneous molecular catalyst (Table 6, entry 3).The recyclability and reusability of MOF 6 were also evaluated in this reaction using 1c as the substrate.The recovered catalyst from simple filtration showed no deterioration of conversion (Table 6, entry 2) and retained the crystallinity of the pristine sample (Figure 4b).The background reaction in the absence of the catalyst but in the presence of light showed only 8 conversion (Table 6, entry 4), verifying that MOF 6 played a catalytic role in the reactions.On the other hand, the reaction of 1c in the dark yielded negligible amounts of coupling products (Table 6, entry 5), demonstrating the necessity of light in this reaction.These observations are consistent with those reported by Lang et al. 75 and Su et al. 76 using carbon nitride and TiO 2 as photocatalysts.Time-dependent conversions of the three substrates have also been monitored by GC analysis at different time points, which gave similar initial reaction rates for the three different substrates.The absence of size selectivity of the initial reaction rates is consistent with the singlet oxygenmediated reaction mechanism.The seemingly lower finial yield of 3d is due to its slow decomposition on MOF 6, presumably catalyzed by the Lewis acidic Zr 6 ( 3 -O) 4 ( 3 -OH) 4 (CO 2 ) 12 building block. The photocatalyzed aerobic oxidation of thioanisole was also examined, using MOF 6 as the photocatalyst.Photocatalytic aerobic oxidation of sulfide to sulfoxide has been reported before with Ru(bpy) 3 2 in acetonitrile but only when a lead ruthenate pyrochlore mineral was added as an electron shuttle. 77We found that by changing the solvent to methanol the photocatalyzed sulfide oxidation occurred without an electron relay (Table 7, entry 1).It is highly likely that the thioanisole oxidation reaction is mediated by the photochemically generated singlet oxygen.88A90 As shown in Table 7, with methanol as the solvent, MOF 6 catalyzed the selective aerobic oxidation of thioanisole to methyl phenyl sulfoxide.No sulfone (the possible overoxidized byproduct) was detected by 1 H NMR, demonstrating a high degree of selectivity of this reaction.The conversion after 22 h is comparable to that of the corresponding homogeneous catalytic system (Table 7, entries 1 and 2).A control experiment with no photocatalyst but with light showed no appreciable conversion of the sulfide Journal of the American Chemical Society ARTICLE (Table 7, entry 3).No sulfoxide products were detected when the reactions were carried out in the absence of light but in the presence of MOF 6 or L 6 (Table 7, entries 4 and 5).O 2 was shown to be the oxidizing agent since no conversion of sulfide to sulfoxide was observed when the reaction was carried out under N 2 protection (Table 7, entries 6 and 7).The PXRD pattern of the MOF 6 catalyst after the reaction was identical to that of the pristine MOF 6, indicating its stability under the reaction conditions (Figure 4)."

    "content": "We have successfully incorporated Ir, Re, and Ru complexes into the UiO framework by a mix-and-match strategy.These stable and porous metal complex-derivatized doped MOFs are highly effective catalysts for a range of reactions related to solar energy utilization.MOFs 1A3 were used in catalytic water oxidation, while MOF 4 catalyzed photochemical CO 2 reduction.MOFs 5 and 6 were used in three photocatalytic organic tranformations: aza-Henry reaction, aerobic amine coupling, and aerobic thioanisole oxidation.Stability of these MOF catalysts under the reaction conditions was verified by comparing PXRD patterns before and after catalysis.The heterogeneous nature of these catalysts can not only facilitate catalyst recycling and reuse but also provide mechanistic insights into the reactions, as in the case of CO 2 reduction using MOF 4. The modular nature of this synthetic approach should allow further fine tuning and optimization to lead to highly active heterogeneous catalysts in solar energy utilization.
