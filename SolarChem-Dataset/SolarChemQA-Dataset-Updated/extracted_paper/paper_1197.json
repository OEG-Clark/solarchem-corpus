    "content": "In this article, we investigate the effect of synthetic solvents on the surface characteristics of the zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) and its photocatalytic activities.Different solvents (deionized (DI) water -ZIF-8 (W), methanol -ZIF-8(M), and a combination of ammonia and ethanol -ZIF-8(A)) were employed to prepare three ZIF-8 samples at room temperature.The fourth sample was obtained after 24 h immersion of ZIF-8(A) in methanol to evacuate pores which we named ZIF-8(AM).These four samples were characterized using XRD, FTIR, FESEM, BET, DRS, and AFM.BET and AFM measurements revealed that all ZIFs have a specific surface area above 1300 m 2 /g while their surface roughness or heterogeneity differs.In contrast to ZIF-8(AM), with the highest level of surface heterogeneity, ZIF-8(M) displayed a very smooth and homogeneous surface.We tested all as-made ZIF-8s for methanol production via CO 2 reduction under UV-vis light irradiation.The results indicate that ZIF-8(AM) produces a high amount of methanol (ca.500 mol.g - cat ) while ZIF-8(M) is almost inactive.These findings reveal that in addition to BET surface area, surface heterogeneity is a significant parameter on photocatalytic activity of ZIF-8."

    "content": "All required chemicals for the synthesis of ZIF-8 including Zinc nitrate hexahydrate, 2-methylimidazole (Hmim), Ammonium hydroxide solution (25 wt in water), ethanol (99), and methanol (99) were supplied from Sigma-Aldrich and Merck and were used as received without further purification.Also, high purity CO 2 (ca.99.99) was provided by Toos Oxygen Corporation (Iran). Water-based ZIF-8 was prepared using the methods reported in the literature with some modifications 32,33.The synthesis begins with the addition of 1.7 g of zinc nitrate hexahydrate into 10 mL deionized water.The solution is stirred for 10 min.Then, the solution was slowly added in a linker emulsion containing 80 mL ethyl alcohol and 22.7 g Hmim and stirred for 15 min.When zinc nitrate solution was added to the Hmim solution slowly, the mixture color changed to milky white.The mixture was stirred for 15 min at room temperature and then kept aging for 7 days.The ZIF-8 precipitate was washed with deionized water several times and dried at 70 C for 12 h. Ammonia-based ZIF-8 was synthesized by the procedures presented in our previous works 34,35.A linker solution containing 1 g Hmim and 12 mL ethanol was added dropwise into zinc nitrate solution that was prepared by dispersion of 0.8 g zinc nitrate hexahydrate in 15 mL ammonium hydroxide 25.After the color of the mixture changed, the milky white solution stirred for 24 h at room temperature and then centrifuged with ethanol several times and dried at 70 C for 12 h. To prepare ZIF-8 (AM), 0.3 g of the as-synthesized ZIF-8 (A) were added into 30 mL methanol and stirred under reflux at 70 C for 24 h.White sediment was observed after centrifugation and drying at 70 C. To prepare methanol based ZIF-8, the linker solution containing 3.28 g Hmim and 100 mL methanol was added slowly into Zn 2 solution that provided by dissolving 2.97 g Zn(NO 3 ) 2 .6H 2 O in 100 mL methanol.The resulting milky white solution was kept 24 h under stirring at room temperature, and then it was washed with methanol several times and dried at 70 C for 12 h 36.A simple schematic for ZIF-8 samples prepared using different solvents is depicted in Scheme 1. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded using Bruker D8-Advance X-ray diffractometer with Cu-K ( 1.54178A ) radiation.The surface area, pore volume, and pore size distribution of the catalysts were determined from N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms at 77 K using Micrometrics ASAP 2020 adsorption instrument.Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy was measured by an Avantes model Avaspec-2048-TEC equipped with AvaLamp DH-S Setup.Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy was recorded on a Thermo Nicolet Avatar 360 (U S A) at room temperature using compacted KBr pellets.By using the TESCAN electron microscope (Mira III, Czech Republic) FESEM images were taken, and then surface topography and roughness of catalysts were performed using ICON atomic force microscope (BRUKER, USA).Also, a 125 W mercury vapor lamp (OSRAM, Germany) was used as the excitation source for the study of photocatalysts wavelength in the range between 300 and 700 nm. The evaluation of the photocatalytic activity of each catalyst was conducted in a batch reactor under UV-vis irradiation in the presence of water.At first, to saturate the solution, high purity CO 2 was bubbled in a three-neck flask glass vessel containing 50 mL water at a constant flow rate for 30 min (Fig. S1).Afterward, 0.05 g of each sample of ZIF-8 photocatalyst were added to the saturated water, and the emulsion was stirred for 1 h under lamp irradiation. The final liquid product was first centrifuged to eliminate the catalysts from reaction media and then analyzed by a GC-FID Agilent JW DB-ALC column instrument (Santa Clara, CA, USA).No product formation was observed neither without photocatalyst nor light, and conversely, CH 3 OH was found and measured when there was the presence of light, photocatalyst and CO 2 ."

    "content": "XRD patterns of all as-prepared catalysts are illustrated in Fig. 1.From these patterns, the diffraction peaks at 2 7.28 , 10.24 , 12.74 , and 18.5 can be clearly observed for all samples, which confirms that ZIF-8 structures are pure and well-developed under the SOD topology phase 23,35.Worthwhile to mention the observed extra peak around 7 in ZIF-8(AM) could probably be attributed to the presence of small quantities of methanol trapped inside the pore of the sample 37.The FT-IR spectra of ZIF-8 (A), ZIF-8 (M), ZIF-8 (AM), and ZIF-8 (W) are shown in Fig. 2. Vibration bands at 421, 759, 1145, 1308, 1422, and 1586 cm -1 belong to ZIF-8 catalysts, confirming the chemical bond formation of ZIF-8 for all catalysts.Stretching vibration peaks of Zn-N and CN appeared at 421 cm -1 and 1586 cm -1 , respectively.Besides, bending signals of the imidazole ring were identified at 759, 1145 and 1308 cm -1 .Moreover, the stretching vibration of the imidazole ring has been characterized at 1422 cm -1 23,35.These analyses demonstrated the correct formation of ZIF-8 frameworks using different solvents. FESEM images of the samples (Fig. 3) show that different solvents have an influence on the shape and sizes of ZIF-8 crystals, which is in good agreement with previous works 23,38.As it has been illustrated in Fig. 3 (a,b), ammonium-based ZIF-8 samples ((AM) and (A)) display a slight aggregation compared to other samples ((W) and (M)) that can be ascribed by the strength of solvents in the dispersion of Zn and Hmim 23,38.Whilst the ZIF-8 (A) and ZIF-8 (AM) unveil hexagonal structure with an average crystal size around 300-350 nm, ZIF-8 (W) and ZIF-8 (M) showed spherical and cubical structures with median sizes of 150 nm and 200 nm, respectively (Fig. 3 (c,d)). Fig. 4 illustrates N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms as well as BJH pore size distribution graphs for all ZIF samples.As it can be observed, all photocatalysts present a type I isotherm according to IUPAC classification with high N 2 uptake at low relative pressures (P/P 0 0.1), stating microporosity of the structures.Table 1 also displays the textural properties of each sample, including Brunauer Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area, pore volume, and median pore diameter.In the basis of obtained results, the highest surface area and pore volume is observed in ZIF-8(AM) with values around 1770 m 2 /g and 0.95 cc/g, respectively.Interestingly, immersion of the as-synthesized ZIF-8 (A) in methanol leads to efficient solvent extraction trapped inside the pores, and, consequently, it results in higher surface area and pore volume as indicated for ZIF-8(AM).Several works have shown a direct relationship between the surface area of photocatalysts and their photocatalytic activity, where a higher surface area provides more active sites for the reaction 22,39. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) topography images of all prepared photocatalysts are shown in Fig. 5.The surface of ZIF-8 (AM) (Fig. 5 (d)) is the most heterogeneous, with remarkable large grown islands distributed on the surface, indicating the highest level of heterogeneity of ZIF-8, among others.On the other hand, Fig. 5 as-prepared ZIF-8(W) and ZIF-8(A) samples contain a lower level of surface heterogeneity compared to ZIF-8 (AM).Moreover, at the surface of ZIF-8(M), no distinguishable grown islands are observed; therefore, this sample has the highest level of surface homogeneity for ZIF-8(M) (Fig. 5 (a)).As mentioned earlier in the introduction section, there are reports illustrating the smooth (homogeneous) surfaces will lead to weaker light absorption and consequently lower photocatalytic activity 30,31,40,41.For instance, Setvin et al. showed the presence of steps (heterogeneity) on the surface of TiO 2 Anatase would help electrons to be trapped at the step edges, facilitating its photocatalytic activity 30.Furthermore, the work of Li et al. demonstrated that the presence of defects on the surface of NH 2 -UIO-66 will result in high electron trapping and enhancing photocatalytic activity 31. From Fig. 6 (a), it can be found that one strong peak in the UV region appears in the wavelength between 200 and 250 nm in all as-made photocatalyst samples.Notwithstanding, ZIF-8(A) exhibited a red-shift in the light absorption spectra to longer wavelengths where several bands are observed from 220 nm to 300 nm.Moreover, few absorption bands were found in the near-visible region (i.e.800 nm), indicating visible light absorption ability on the surface of ZIF-8(A).Therefore, the level of surface heterogeneity was found to be a significant parameter affecting the increase of UV and visible light absorption.Table 2 illustrates the bandgap energy of the samples, which was calculated via Tauc plots as shown in Fig. 6 (b) 22,42.In this plot, is defined as the absorption coefficient obtained from Kubelka-Munk transformation function, is frequency, and h is Planck's constant 20.As it can be seen, ZIF(AM) (with the highest level of surface heterogeneity) exhibited the lowest bandgap energy around 5.17 eV, and after that, the bandgap energies are ordered: ZIF-8(M) ZIF-8(A) ZIF-8(W).This lower bandgap energy of ZIF-8(AM) is caused by higher surface heterogeneity which makes the surface more favorable for electron trapping.Table 3 also shows the calculated conduct and valance band energy levels (E CB and E VB ) 43 which are in good agreement with previous data available in the literature 44,45.As it has been illustrated in this table, all ZIF samples have enough energy to reduce CO 2 to MeOH because the required energy (redox potentials) values for water splitting and CO 2 reduction to methanol (-4.1 eV and -3.5 eV) 45 are located between E CB and E VB energy levels.It is worthwhile to mention that for applications in photocatalysis, not only the magnitude of the bandgap but also the absolute positions of the band edges are important. To assess the capability of as-prepared photocatalysts in the reduction of CO 2 , the yield of methanol production using each sample was measured and compared as shown in Fig. 7. Obviously, the effect of synthetic solvents on the ability of the ZIF-8 structure to produce methanol is undeniable.As it has been shown, the amount of methanol obtained by ZIF-8(M) is near to zero, while its bandgap energy is similar to that of ZIF-8(AM).This observation clearly proves the significant influence of the surface heterogeneity alongside the surface area of each photocatalyst 22.Whilst the surface area of ZIF-8(M) is around 1300 m 2 /g like ZIF-8(W) sample, nevertheless, its methanol production is negligible due to the very low surface heterogeneity.Such amount of methanol production has also been previously reported by ZIF-8 synthesized in the presence of methanol as a solvent 46474849. On the other hand, ZIF-8(AM) exhibited the highest amount of methanol production with an amount of around 500 mol.g - cat .This large amount of methanol production by ZIF-8(AM) is not only because of its lower bandgap energy (see Table 2) but also is owing to its higher specific surface area and higher surface heterogeneity compared to the other samples.After ZIF-8(AM), ZIF-8(A) and ZIF-8(W) produced almost the same amount of methanol, around 200 and 230 mol.g -1 cat , respectively.The higher methanol production using ZIF-8(A) is attributed to its higher surface area, affirming the importance of surface area along with surface heterogeneity in the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 .The obtained methanol using these two photocatalysts was relatively half of what was produced by ZIF-8(AM).Table 4 summarizes and compares the result of methanol production obtained in this study with different types of ZIF-8 synthesized using various solvents.Although the reported reaction conditions are not similar, it can suitably prove the role of surface heterogeneity in the methanol production yield. In order to evaluate the stability and cyclic usability of samples, XRD, FTIR, UV-vis, and GC analyses were performed for recovered ZIF-8 photocatalysts (after 1 h of reaction) and compared with fresh samples as shown in Fig. S2 to S4, and Fig. 8 18,22,52,53.We have recently discussed in our previous work 22 that the ZIF-8 structure unveils structural instability in long-term exposure (at least 2 h) to water and in the presence of CO 2 due to carbonic acid production.Nonetheless, in our system, the required reaction time is only 1 h (60 min) which won't cause any stability issues for the samples.As can be seen in Fig. S2 to Fig. S4, the XRD, FTIR, and UV-vis analyses of recovered photocatalysts are similar to the fresh samples confirming the high stability of as-made ZIFs in the presence of water and CO 2 .It should be mention that the appeared FTIR bands around 2800 cm -1 and 3500 cm -1 in the spent samples can be attributed to C-H and O-H band vibrations of methanol and water trapped inside the pores 53.Moreover, the recovered samples were reused in the CO 2 reduction process for producing methanol.As it's been shown in Fig. 8, all recovered samples displayed the exact methanol production yield like fresh samples.A slight increase in the yield of methanol production in the second cycle by using the recovered samples can be attributed to the small amount of methanol produced in the first cycle trapped inside the pores of the structures. Worthwhile to mentioning, the recovery of samples was only performed by collecting the samples and drying in a vacuum oven for 12 h at 75 C."

    "content": "The influence of surface characteristics of ZIF-8 on its photocatalytic activity towards CO 2 reduction to methanol was investigated in this study.Four different ZIF-8 samples using different synthetic solvents were prepared at room temperature and then thoroughly analyzed by various techniques.BET confirmed that all samples contain great specific surface area while AFM images unveiled different surface heterogeneity for the samples.ZIF-8(AM), which was synthesized by ammonia and then immersed in methanol, indicated the highest level of heterogeneity.After that, ZIF-8(A) and ZIF-8(W) showed almost the same heterogeneity, slightly smoother than ZIF-8(AM).On the surface of ZIF-8 synthesized using methanol, no heterogeneity was observed.Eventually, all fresh samples were tested in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 to methanol process.Moreover, the bandgap energy for all ZIF photocatalysts was calculated using Tauc Plot, indicating that ZIF-8(AM) and ZIF-8(W) correspond to the smallest and largest amount of E g , respectively.As a consequence, ZIF-8(AM), which demonstrated the most heterogeneous surface, highest surface area, and smallest E g , produced the highest amount of methanol equal to 523.4 mol.g -1 cat and afterward ZIF-8(A), ZIF-8(W), and ZIF-8(M) were ranked.The stability and reusability of the samples were studied by different analyses like XRD, FTIR, UV-vis, and GC.The obtained results confirmed the high stability of the prepared samples in the process of CO 2 reduction.These results clearly demonstrate the importance of the synthetic solvents on the ZIF- Fig. 8.The effect of recycling runs on the methanol production yield using fresh (First), and recovered samples (Second).
