    "content": "The photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide with water to fuels and chemicals is a longstanding challenge.This article focuses on the effects of cocatalysts and reaction modes on photocatalytic behaviors of TiO 2 with an emphasis on the selectivity of photogenerated electrons for CO 2 reduction in the presence of H 2 O, which has been overlooked in most of the published papers.Our results clarified that the reaction using H 2 O vapor exhibited significantly higher selectivity for CO 2 reduction than that by immersing the photocatalyst into liquid H 2 O.We examined the effect of noble metal cocatalysts and found that the rate of CH 4 formation increased in the sequence of Ag Rh Au Pd Pt, corresponding well to the increase in the efficiency of electron-hole separation.This indicates that Pt is the most effective cocatalyst to extract photogenerated electrons for CO 2 reduction.The selectivity of CH 4 in CO 2 reduction was also enhanced by Pt.The size and loading amount of Pt affected the activity; a smaller mean size of Pt particles and an appropriate loading amount favored the formation of reduction products.The reduction of H 2 O to H 2 was accelerated more than the reduction of CO 2 in the presence of Pt, leading to a lower selectivity for CO 2 reduction and limited increases in CH 4 formation rate.We demonstrated that the addition of MgO into the Pt-TiO 2 catalyst could further enhance the formation of CH 4 .The formation of H 2 was suppressed simultaneously, suggesting the increase in the selectivity for CO 2 reduction in the presence of MgO.Furthermore, the MgO-and Pt-modified TiO 2 catalyst exhibited a higher CH 4 selectivity in CO 2 reduction."

The catalyst was surrounded by CO 2 and H 2 O vapor.The pressure of CO 2 was typically regulated to 0.2 MPa.The temperature of the reactor was kept at 323 K, and the vapor pressure of H 2 O was 12.3 kPa under such a circumstance.For the solid-liquid interface reaction mode (Figure 1, right), the catalyst was dispersed in 4.0 mL water, which was precharged in the bottom of the reactor.The pressure of CO 2 and the temperature of reactor were 0.2 MPa and 323 K, respectively, which were the same as in the solid-gas interface reactions mode.The photocatalytic reaction was typically performed for 10 h.The amounts of CO, CH 4 , and H 2 formed were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC).The reaction system was connected to an online GC through valves, and the gaseous products could be directly introduced to the GC for analysis.We adopted a flame ionization detector (FID) for quantifying the amounts of CO and CH 4 formed from CO 2 to ensure high sensitivities.After the effluents containing CO 2 , CO, and CH 4 were separated by a carbon molecular sieve (TDX-01) column, CO and CO 2 were further converted to CH 4 by a methanation reactor, and were then analyzed by the FID detector.The detection limits of our analytic method for CH 4 and CO were both 0.002 mol, corresponding to 0.5 ppm in concentration.H 2 and O 2 were analyzed by an Agilent Micro GC3000 (Micro GC) equipped with a Molecular Sieve 5A column and a highsensitivity thermal conductivity detector (TCD).Argon was used as the carrier gas.The Micro GC was connected directly to the reactor by a stainless-steel tube, and the gaseous products were introduced to the Micro GC by a self-suction type injection pump.The detection limits for H 2 and O 2 were 0.004 mol (1 ppm) and 0.2 mol (50 ppm), respectively.The relative errors for the products except for O 2 were typically lower than 5.Liquid products such as CH 3 OH, HCHO, and HCOOH possibly formed and dissolved in water were also analyzed carefully by gas chromatography or high-performance liquid chromatography, but no such products were detected under our reaction conditions.We performed the same experiment (including both reaction and analysis) for at least 3 times for each catalyst, and the relative standard deviations for the amounts of H 2 , CO, and CH 4 formed were 5."

    "content": "3.1.Influence of Reaction Mode.We performed a comparative study on photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O using solid-gas and solid-liquid interface reaction modes.Over our TiO 2 and 0.5 wt Pt-TiO 2 catalysts, CO and CH 4 were the only products formed from CO 2 irrespective of the reaction mode.The formation of H 2 due to the reduction of H 2 O was also observed.We further observed the formation of O 2 .These observations suggest the occurrence of the following reactions over our catalysts: (1) (2) To evaluate the efficiency of photogenerated electrons used for the reduction reactions, we have calculated the rate of electron consumption for the formation of all reductive products with the following equation: where r(CO), r(CH 4 ), and r(H 2 ) are the formation rates of CO, CH 4 , and H 2 , respectively.Furthermore, considering that the reduction of H 2 O to H 2 is competitive with the reduction of CO 2 to CO and CH 4 , we have evaluated the selectivity for CO 2 reduction on an electron basis using the follow equation: Selectivity for CO reduction () Table 1 shows photocatalytic results obtained for TiO 2 and 0.5 wt Pt-TiO 2 catalysts using two different reaction modes (i.e., the solid-gas and solid-liquid interface reaction modes).For each catalyst, the rates of electron consumption used for reduction, that is, R(electron), with the two reaction modes were similar.However, the rates of product formations depended strongly on the reaction mode.The formation rates of CH 4 and CO with the solid-gas reaction mode were significantly higher than those with the solid-liquid reaction mode, while the formation rate of H 2 was higher with the latter reaction mode.The selectivity of photogenerated electrons for CO 2 reduction was significantly higher with the solid-gas reaction mode. We speculate that the lower selectivity for CO 2 reduction in the case of using the solid-liquid interface reaction mode is 1 also demonstrates that the loading of Pt as a cocatalyst onto TiO 2 can accelerate the photocatalytic performance for product formation.To gain further insights into the role of cocatalysts, we have investigated in more detail the effect of noble metal cocatalysts on the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 using the solid-gas interface reaction mode.Table 2 shows that the loading of noble metal cocatalysts including Pt, Pd, Rh, Au, and Ag all enhances the rate of consumption of photogenerated electrons for the reductive reactions, i.e., R(electron).R(electron) increased in the sequence of TiO 2 Ag-TiO 2 Rh-TiO 2 Au-TiO 2 Pd-TiO 2 Pt-TiO 2 .This trend corresponds well to that for the work function of noble metals, which reflects the electron donating or accepting ability and increases in the order of Ag Rh Au Pd Pt. 38 Thus, it is reasonable to speculate that the cocatalyst may extract the electrons from TiO 2 and, thus, decrease the probability of recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes. To confirm the role of cocatalyst, we have performed transient photocurrent response measurements.The result displayed in Figure 2 reveals that the photocurrent increases in the sequence of TiO 2 Ag-TiO 2 Rh-TiO 2 Au-TiO 2 Pd-TiO 2 Pt-TiO 2 , which is in agreement with that for R(electron).This observation further confirms our idea that the noble metal cocatalyst on TiO 2 functions for the extraction of electrons from TiO 2 , contributing to the increase in the efficiency of photogenerated electrons for the formation of reductive products. Table 2 also reveals that the presence of a noble metal cocatalyst significantly increases the rate of CH 4 formation, whereas the rate of CO formation does not increase significantly and it rather decreases when Rh is used as the cocatalyst.In other words, the product selectivity in the reduction of CO 2 is also dependent on the presence of noble metal cocatalyst.It is known that the control of the product selectivity during the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 is challenging, and there is little knowledge on the factors determining the product distribution. 10Our present work has clearly demonstrated that the selectivity of CH 4 can be markedly enhanced at the expense of CO by loading noble metal cocatalyst onto TiO 2 .For example, the Pt-TiO 2 catalyst provided a CH 4 selectivity of 83 on a carbon basis, which was significantly higher than that over TiO 2 (24).It is reasonable to consider that CO and CH 4 are formed via proton-assisted multielectron transfer reactions eqs 1 and 2. 39Thus, the enrichment of electron density on Pt particles may enhance the probability of eight-electron transfer reactions to form CH 4 . The presence of noble metal cocatalyst not only enhanced the reduction of CO 2 to CH 4 but also accelerated the reduction of H 2 O to H 2 .The selectivity of the photogenerated electrons for CO 2 reduction decreased from 56 for TiO 2 to 39-45 for the catalysts promoted by the noble metals listed in Table 2.In other words, although the use of noble metal cocatalyst can increase the efficiency of electrons used for reductive reactions due to the enhanced electron-hole separation probability, the reduction of H 2 O is accelerated more than the reduction of CO 2 .It is undoubtedly needed to develop strategies to increase the selectivity of photogenerated electrons for CO 2 reduction.showed that the catalyst prepared by the impregnation followed by H 2 reduction (denoted as Pt-TiO 2 -imp-H 2 ) possessed larger Pt particles, while the hydrazine reduction provided a catalyst (denoted as Pt-TiO 2 -hydrazine) with smaller Pt particles (Figure 3).The mean sizes of Pt particles evaluated by counting 100 particles were 6.8 and 3.7 nm for these two catalysts, and the latter one was similar to that evaluated for the catalyst prepared by the photodeposition method (denoted as Pt-TiO 2 ).We further prepared the Pt-TiO 2 catalysts with different Pt loadings, and our TEM measurements clarified that the mean size of Pt particles increased slightly with Pt loadings (Figure 3).Table 3 displays the catalytic behaviors of the Pt-promoted TiO 2 catalysts prepared by different methods as well as the Pt-TiO 2 catalysts with different Pt loadings for photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .It is clear that the loading of Pt can significantly enhance the formation of CH 4 , but the reduction of H 2 O to H 2 is also accelerated at the same time.We found that the photocatalytic behavior is dependent on the mean size of Pt particles.Among the 0.5 wt Pt-promoted TiO 2 catalysts prepared by different methods, the 0.5 wt Pt-TiO 2 -imp-H 2 catalyst with the largest mean size of Pt particles exhibited the lowest CH 4 formation activity.The formation of CO was slightly enhanced, and the selectivity of CH 4 in CO 2 reduction products was the lowest (40 on carbon basis) over this catalyst.On the other hand, the 0.5 wt Pt-TiO 2 -hydrazine and 0.5 wt Pt-TiO 2 , which possessed Pt particles with similar mean sizes, showed similar photocatalytic performances.The rates of CH 4 formations were 5.0 and 5.2 mol g -1 h -1 over these two catalysts, which were 13 and 4 times higher than those over TiO 2 and the 0.5 wt Pt-TiO 2 -imp-H 2 , respectively. Further analysis revealed that the rates of consumption of photogenerated electrons for reductive reactions described by R(electron) over the 0.5 wt Pt-TiO 2 -hydrazine and 0.5 wt Pt-TiO 2 catalysts were 1 order of magnitude and 2.5 times higher than those over TiO 2 and the 0.5 wt Pt-TiO 2 -imp-H 2 catalysts, respectively.This suggests the difference in the separation of photogenerated electron and hole pairs among the Pt-promoted catalysts prepared by different methods.We have exploited the photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, which is a powerful tool to provide information on surface processes involving the recombination of photogenerated charge carriers, 40 for our 0.5 wt Pt-promoted TiO 2 catalysts prepared by different methods.Generally, the photoluminescence can be generated during the recombination of the photogenerated carriers on a semiconductor.We observed a visible luminescence band centered at 500 nm for TiO 2 (Figure 4A).This could be ascribed to the recombination of photoexcited electrons and holes possibly due to the oxygen vacancies on TiO 2 . 40When Pt was loaded onto TiO 2 , the intensity of the luminescence band at 500 nm decreased, suggesting a reduced charge carrier recombination.This can be explained by the migration of excited electrons from TiO 2 to the Pt nanoparticle, preventing the electron-hole recombination.Our result in Figure 4 suggests that the smaller Pt nanoparticles over the 0.5 wt Pt-TiO 2 -hydrazine and 0.5 wt Pt-TiO 2 catalysts are more efficient to extract the electrons from TiO 2 than the bigger ones over the 0.5 wt Pt-TiO 2imp-H 2 due to the larger interfaces between Pt and TiO 2 in the former two catalysts.This corresponds well to the higher rates of consumption of photogenerated electrons for reductive reactions over the 0.5 wt Pt-TiO 2 -hydrazine and 0.5 wt Pt-TiO 2 catalysts.Concerning the selectivity of photogenerated electrons for CO 2 reduction, the value was lower over the 0.5 wt Pt-TiO 2 -imp-H 2 catalyst than those over the 0.5 wt Pt-TiO 2hydrazine and 0.5 wt Pt-TiO 2 catalysts.Thus, the catalyst with larger Pt particles accelerated the reduction of H 2 O to H 2 more than the reduction of CO 2 .Possibly, H 2 O was preferentially chemisorbed on the surfaces of larger Pt particles.Moreover, our result showed that the catalyst with bigger Pt particles exhibited lower selectivity to CH 4 in CO 2 reduction products as compared to those with smaller Pt particles.This is likely due to the relatively lower electron density on bigger Pt particles. The photocatalytic result for the Pt-TiO 2 catalysts with different Pt loadings showed that the increase in the Pt loading from 0.1 wt to 1.0 wt increased both CH 4 and H 2 formation rates (Table 3).CO formation rate rather decreased at a Pt loading of 1.0 wt .The selectivity of photogenerated electrons for CO 2 reduction changed only slightly with Pt loading.The rate of electron consumption for reduction reactions, i.e., R(electron), increased with Pt loadings up to 1.0 wt .A further increase in the Pt loading to 2.0 wt decreased R(electron) and also the rates of CH 4 and H 2 formations.The PL spectra for this series of catalysts revealed that the increase in the Pt loading up to 1.0 wt decreased the intensity of the luminescence band at 500 nm, and thus, the probability of charge carrier recombination.The intensity of the luminescence band at 500 nm increased as the Pt loading rose to 2.0 wt (Figure 4B), suggesting that the excessively high Pt loading is rather unfavorable for the separation of electron-hole pair.It is speculated that the electron generated on TiO 2 can be extracted to a Pt particle nearby and the distance between the hole remaining on TiO 2 and the Pt particle may become shorter if the Pt loading becomes higher. 41This may increase the probability of recombination of electrons and holes.This result corresponds well to the decreases in R(electron) and the formation rates of CH 4 and H 2 at the higher Pt loading (2.0 wt ). A few papers have demonstrated that the addition of MgO can promote photocatalytic performances of TiO 2 -based catalysts for CO 2 reduction possibly due to the enhancement in CO 2 chemisorption or the generated Ti 3 sites. 4243344 However, it is still unclear whether the presence of MgO can accelerate the separation of electron-hole pairs.Moreover, there is no information on the effect of MgO on the selectivity of photogenerated electrons for CO 2 reduction. To clarify the roles of MgO in photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 , we have prepared MgO-Pt-TiO 2 catalysts with MgO contents ranging from 0.25 to 3.0 wt .TEM measurements clarified that MgO existed as amorphous layers on TiO 2 (Figure 5).The mean size of Pt evaluated from the TEM micrographs by counting 100 particles was almost independent of MgO content.We also measured the amount of CO 2 chemisorption over this series of catalysts and found that the amount of CO 2 chemisorption increased with MgO content (Table 4). Our photocatalytic result in Table 4 showed that the rate of consumption of photogenerated electrons for reductive reactions, i.e., R(electron), did not change significantly by the addition of MgO into the Pt-TiO 2 catalyst with contents of 0-1.0 wt .The further addition of MgO rather decreased R(electron).Our transient photocurrent response measurements clarified that the photocurrent decreased slightly after the addition of MgO to the Pt-TiO 2 catalyst with contents of 0-1.0 wt (Figure 6).The decrease in the photocurrent became significant when the content of MgO was 2.0 wt .This clearly suggests that the ability to separate the electronhole pairs does not change significantly by the addition of MgO with a content of 0.25-1.0wt .The larger amount of MgO decreased R(electron), probably because the excess MgO may significantly cover TiO 2 surface and/or hinder the migration of photogenerated electrons from TiO 2 to Pt particles. It is of interest that, although R(electron) did not increase by the addition of MgO to the Pt-TiO 2 catalyst, the rate of CH 4 formation increased significantly from 5.2 to 11 mol g -1 h -1 as the content of MgO rose from 0 to 1.0 wt .At the same time, the rate of CO formation decreased from 1.1 to 0.03 mol g -1 h -1 .Thus, the selectivity of CH 4 in CO 2 reduction products increased to 99 (on carbon basis).The rate of H 2 formation decreased from 33 to 11 mol g -1 h -1 on increasing the content of MgO from 0 to 1.0 wt .Therefore, the selectivity of photogenerated electrons for CO 2 reduction increased markedly from 40 to 79.A further increase in MgO content did not change the selectivity significantly, but the rates of product formations decreased due to the covering of TiO 2 by MgO or the hindering of electron transfer between TiO 2 and Pt as evidenced by the significant decrease in the photocurrent at higher MgO contents (2.0 wt , Figure 6). Figure 7 shows the changes of product amounts with the reaction time during the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 over the 1.0 wt MgO-0.5 wt Pt-TiO 2 catalyst.The amounts of CH 4 and H 2 both increased almost linearly with the reaction time.Bazzo and Urakawa recently reported transient formations of H 2 and CH 4 in initial 1 h followed by rapid deactivation during the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 at relatively higher temperatures (353 and 423 K) over a Pt/TiO 2 catalyst. 45The almost linear increases in the product amounts with time in Figure 7 allow us to confirm that the formations of both CH 4 and H 2 over our catalyst proceed in a steady-state manner but not a transient manner.We performed the repeated uses of the 1.0 wt MgO-0.5 wt Pt-TiO 2 catalyst.After 10 h, the system was degassed and then CO 2 was reintroduced into the reactor (Figure 7).Similar activities for the formations of CH 4 and H 2 were observed in the second and the third runs.This suggests that the reactions over our photocatalyst are catalytic reactions but not stoichiometric ones.Our result in Figure 7 also indicates that the 1.0 wt MgO-0.5 wt Pt-TiO 2 catalyst is stable under our reaction conditions.We further carried out the photocatalytic reaction in the absence of CO 2 .As displayed in Figure 7, when N 2 was used instead of CO 2 over the 1.0 wt MgO-0.5 wt Pt-TiO 2 catalyst, H 2 was formed and the amount of H 2 was slightly larger than that formed in the presence of CO 2 .However, no CO and only a trace amount of CH 4 were detected in the absence of CO 2 (0.1 mol in 10 h).This confirms that CH 4 is formed predominantly via the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 over our catalyst. The amount of O 2 formed during the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 in the presence of H 2 O was also quantified for several catalysts, although the experimental error for O 2 quantification was larger than that for H 2 , CO or CH 4 quantification.For example, for the 1.0 wt MgO-0.5 wt Pt-TiO 2 catalyst, the amount of O 2 detected was 13.6 mol after 30 h of reaction under typical reaction conditions (catalyst, 0.020 g; CO 2 pressure, 0.2 MPa; H 2 O, 4 mL).At the same time, the amounts of H 2 and CH 4 formed were 6.3 and 5.5 mol, respectively.Only a trace amount of CO was detected.If we assume that the oxidation of H 2 O to O 2 is the sole reaction to consume the photogenerated holes eq 4 and that the photogenerated electrons are used for the formations of CO, CH 4 , and H 2 eqs 1-3, the stoichiometric molar ratio of O 2 /(CO 4CH 4 H 2 ) should be 1/2.The molar ratio of O 2 /(CO 4CH 4 H 2 ) calculated from our results was 0.48, which was close to the stoichiometric ratio.This suggests that the reactions of eqs 1-4 mainly occur over our photocatalysts and also provides evidence that CH 4 is formed from the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 . Therefore, it becomes clear that the MgO-Pt-TiO 2 catalyst with a proper MgO content (1.0 wt ) is a highly selective catalyst for the preferential reduction of CO 2 in the presence of H 2 O.Moreover, CH 4 is the predominant product in the reduction of CO 2 over this photocatalyst.We have demonstrated that MgO plays a key role in enhancing the preferential photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 to CH 4 in the presence of H 2 O. Tanaka and co-workers reported that MgO or MgOcontaining layered double hydroxides could work for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 to CO in the presence of H 2 or H 2 O. 46 However, MgO or Pt-loaded MgO without TiO 2 was inactive for the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 with H 2 O under our reaction conditions.Thus, MgO should function as a cocatalyst of TiO 2 together with Pt in our system.Although it has been clarified that MgO cannot increase the ability to separate the electron-hole pairs, the presence of MgO significantly increases the chemisorption of CO 2 .On the basis of these results, we propose that MgO provides basic sites for the preferential chemisorption of CO 2 onto the catalyst surface and these chemisorbed CO 2 molecules can be efficiently reduced by the electrons on the nearby Pt nanoparticles extracted from TiO 2 . 3.5.Discussion on Possible Reaction Mechanism.As mentioned previously, the control of selectivity, including both the selectivity of photogenerated electrons for CO 2 reduction and the selectivity of products in CO 2 reduction, is a challenging research target. 10Our present work has demonstrated that the modification of TiO 2 with Pt and MgO can significantly promote the selectivity of photogenerated electrons for CO 2 reduction and for CH 4 formation.To gain insights into the pathways for CO and CH 4 formations over our photocatalysts would be helpful to understand the promoting effects in depth. Generally, it is difficult to consider the successive singleelectron transfer mechanism for the formations of CO and CH 4 because the potential for the single-electron reduction of CO 2 (-2.14 V vs SCE) is highly unfavorable. 39Instead, the reduction of CO 2 can be expected to proceed via the protonassisted multielectron transfer mechanism.However, the reduction of CO 2 , in particular the formation of CH 4 , is quite complicated.CH 4 may be produced via the direct reduction of CO 2 through eight-electron mechansim eq 2, via the hydrogenation of CO 2 under dark by the hydrogen formed via the photocatalytic reduction of H 2 O eq 7, or via CO through the hydrogenation under dark or irradiation eqs 8 and 9. 28,29 To gain information on the pathway for CH 4 formation, we have performed several control experiments.take place over our catalysts.However, it should be noted that the rate of CH 4 formation in the photocatalytic reduction of CO is significantly lower than that in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 , although CO 2 is believed to be more difficult to activate.On the other hand, the rate of H 2 formation, which arose from the photocatalytic reduction of H 2 O, became significantly higher when CO was used to replace CO 2 .These observations clearly demonstrate that our photocatalysts are more efficient for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 than that of CO.On the basis of these experimental results, we propose that CH 4 is mainly formed via the direct photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 , although we cannot completely rule out the possibility that a part of CH 4 may be formed via the photocatalytic reduction of CO. It can be expected that the formations of CH 4 and CO, two parallel products, are the compromise between the thermodynamics and the charge transfer. 29On the one hand, the formation of CH 4 is thermodynamically more favorable than that of CO. 39 On the other hand, the formation of CH 4 requires eight electrons, while that of CO only needs two electrons.CO was formed as a major product over TiO 2 possibly because of the low density of electrons.It can be easily understood that the loading of Pt increases the selectivity of CH 4 because the enrichment of electron density on Pt particles can enhance the probability of multielectron reactions to CH 4 .One of the most significant points of our present work is the further increase in CH 4 selectivity by the addition of MgO, although the electron density on Pt is not further accelerated as evidenced by the photocurrent measurements.At the same time, the selectivity of photogenerated electrons used for CO 2 reduction as compared to those for H 2 O reduction also increases in the presence of MgO.The enhanced chemisorption of CO 2 on catalyst surfaces due to the presence of MgO could accelerate the reduction of CO 2 and suppress that of H 2 O. Furthermore, we speculate that the synergistic effect between MgO and Pt, which enhanced the chemisorption of CO 2 and the electron density, is responsible for the selective formation of CH 4 ."

    "content": "The present work focused on the development of efficient photocatalytic systems for the preferential photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 in the presence of H 2 O.We found that the use of the solid-gas interface reaction mode, i.e., the reaction of CO 2 with H 2 O vapor, resulted in higher selectivity of photogenerated electrons toward the reduction of CO 2 to CO and CH 4 as compared to the reduction of H 2 O to H 2 .The predominant exposure of catalyst surface to H 2 O, which was the case in the solid-liquid interface reactions, could be avoided in the solid-gas interface reactions.We studied the effect of cocatalysts on catalytic behaviors of TiO 2 for photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 using the solid-gas interface reaction mode.Among several noble metals including Pt, Pd, Rh, Au, and Ag, Pt was the most efficient cocatalyst to extract the photogenerated electrons for the reductive reactions.The loading of Pt onto TiO 2 also increased the selectivity of CH 4 and decreased that of CO possibly because the enhanced electron density favored the eight-electron reduction of CO 2 to CH 4 .The size and loading amount of Pt also affected the photocatalytic behavior of Pt-TiO 2 catalysts.The catalysts with smaller Pt particles and proper Pt loadings favored the CH 4 formation rate and CH 4 selectivity.However, the presence of Pt also accelerated the reduction of H 2 O to H 2 , and the selectivity of photogenerated electrons for CO 2 reduction rather decreased slightly.We demonstrated that the addition of MgO to the Pt-TiO 2 catalyst significantly increased the selectivity for CO 2 reduction although the rate of electron consumption for reductive reactions did not change significantly.The presence of MgO remarkably suppressed the reduction of H 2 O to H 2 and accelerated the reduction of CO 2 .Furthermore, the addition of MgO into the Pt-TiO 2 catalyst further improved the selectivity of CH 4 in CO 2 reduction to 99.The synergistic effect between the enhanced CO 2 chemisorption and electron density on the surface of MgOand Pt-co-promoted TiO 2 is proposed to be responsible for the improvement of the selectivity for CO 2 reduction and CH 4 formation.Our work has provided important clues for selectivity control in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 in the presence of H 2 O.

Influence of Reaction Mode on Photocatalytic Performances of TiO 2 and 0.5 wt Pt-TiO 2 for Reduction of CO 2 in the Presence of H 2 O a by the predominant covering of the catalyst with H 2 O due to the limited solubility of CO 2 in H 2 O.This leads to higher formation rate of H 2 but lower ones of CH 4 and CO.In other words, a larger fraction of the photogenerated electrons are used for the reduction of H 2 O instead of CO 2 .The presence of Pt accelerated the rate of electron consumption for reductive reactions, i.e., R(electron), but these electrons were mainly used for the reduction of H 2 O to H 2 in the case of the solid-liquid interface reaction mode.On the other hand, the solid-gas interface reaction mode can allow the exposure of the catalyst surface to CO 2 atmosphere and avoid the predominant formation of H 2 .Thus, it becomes clear that the solid-gas interface reaction mode is more suitable for the preferential reduction of CO 2 in the presence of H 2 O. a Reaction conditions: catalyst, 0.020 g; CO 2 pressure, 0.2 MPa; H 2 O, 4.0 mL; irradiation time, 10 h.caused 3.2.Effect of Noble Metal Cocatalysts.Table Catalytic Behaviors of TiO 2 Promoted by Noble Metal Cocatalysts for Photocatalytic Reduction of CO 2 in the Presence of H 2 O Vapor a a Reaction conditions: catalyst, 0.020 g; CO 2 pressure, 0.2 MPa; H 2 O, 4.0 mL; irradiation time, 10 h.bThe content of cocatalyst is 0.5 wt . c From ref38.

This suggests that the photocatalytic reduction of CO in the presence of H 2 O, i.e., reaction 9, can Catalytic Behaviors of Pt-TiO 2 and MgO-Pt-TiO 2 in Several Control Experiments a The loading of Pt was 0.5 wt ; the content of MgO was 1.0 wt . c H 2 /CO 2 or H 2 /CO 1/99. b Downloaded by UNIV AUTONOMA DE MADRID on September 3, 2015 http://pubs.acs.orgPublication Date (Web): September 17, 2014 doi: 10.1021/cs500648p The authors declare no competing financial interest.
