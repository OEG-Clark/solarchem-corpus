    "content": "2.1.Preparation of Nb-Doped TiO 2 Nanotube Array.Nbdoped TiO 2 nanotube array samples were created by anodization at room temperature.First, the Ti/Nb alloy was prepared by hightemperature nonconsumable vacuum arc melting starting from highpurity Ti and Nb powders mixed together with the Nb/Ti atomic ratio at 5 under an Ar atmosphere.The Ti/Nb alloy with a single-phase microstructure was created by treating at 1000 C for 4 h and then quenched in saltwater to room temperature at a cooling rate of 2000 C s -1 .Then, the Ti/Nb alloy was incised into thin sheets, ground, and polished by the abrasive paper.Before anodization, Ti/Nb alloy sheets were ultrasonically degreased with ethanol, acetone, and deionized (DI) water, respectively, and then blow-dried with a nitrogen purge.The anodization process was carried out in a two-electrode electrochemical system with the Ti/Nb alloy sheet as the working electrode and the platinum foil as the cathode in the electrolyte of ethylene glycol contained 0.3 wt NH 4 F and 3 vol H 2 O at 60 V for 2 h.To remove residual organics from the obtained sample, it was soaked in DI water for 8 h after anodization and then dried in air.After drying, the sample was calcinated in air at 550 C for 2 h at a heating rate of 2 C min -1 for sample crystallization and then cooled to room temperature naturally.For comparison, the pristine TiO 2 nanotube array was also prepared from Ti foil by the same experimental process. 2.2.Material Characterization.The crystal structures of asprepared samples were analyzed on an X-ray powder diffractometer (D/max-2400, Rigaku Corporation, Japan) using the Cu K radiation ( 1.54178A) at a scanning speed of 0.02 o per step.Their morphologies were characterized by both the field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, LEO, SUPRA55, Germany) and the transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL, 2100F, Japan).Their chemical compositions and states were investigated by an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS, ESCALAB250, Thermo).The optical absorbance spectra of these samples were analyzed using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu Corporation, UV-2550, Japan).Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis and the CO 2 adsorption were carried out on an AUTOSORB IQ2 analyzer (Quantachrome Instruments) at 298 K. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra were investigated using a Bruker A300 at 9.85 GHz and 77 K. 2.3.Photocatalytic CO 2 Reduction Measurement.A closed, flat-bottomed quartz vessel was used as the reactor to conduct the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction experiments at room temperature.Typically, 50 mg of the as-obtained photocatalyst was ultrasonically suspended in an aqueous NaHCO 3 solution (0.1 M, 45 mL) with triethanolamine (5 mL) as the sacrificial agent.Then, a high-purity CO 2 gas (99.99) was continuously bubbled through the aqueous NaHCO 3 solution at a rate of 80 mL min -1 for 30 min to expel the dissolved oxygen in the vessel and saturate it with CO 2 .Next, the suspension was stirred on a magnetic stirrer at room temperature in dark for 30 min to reach the adsorption/desorption equilibrium before the simulated solar light illumination was switched on.The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction experiments were conducted under simulated solar illumination, which was provided by a 300 W Xe lamp (PLSSXE300, Beijing Perfect Light Technology Co., Ltd., Beijing, P. R. China) with a light intensity of 200 mW cm -2 .At each time intervals, 1 L aliquots of the reaction solution were withdrawn using a syringe, and the reduction products in the solution were qualitatively analyzed by gas chromatography (GC, Agilent 7890B) equipped with both a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a flame ionization detector (FID), and helium served as the carrier gas. 2.4.First-Principles Calculations of CO 2 Adsorption on Nb-Doped TiO 2 (001) Facets.First-principles calculations were carried out to compare CO 2 adsorption on pristine and Nb-doped anatase TiO 2 (001) and (011) facets.Density-functional theory (DFT) calculations with a plane-wave basis set were conducted within the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP) 32,33 with the exchange and correlation treated by the gradient-corrected PBE functional. 34To model our system, we used a supercell of 2 2 1 containing 51 atoms with periodic boundary conditions used along the x and y directions.The sampling of the Brillouin zone was performed using a 5 5 1 centered k-point mesh for the calculations.The plane-wave energy cutoff was taken as 550 eV.The convergence tolerance for the electronic relaxation was 10 -5 eV/cell, and the total energy was calculated using the linear tetrahedron method with Blochl corrections. 35Conjugate gradient methods were employed for all structural relaxations to minimize the structure's total energy until the required Hellmann-Feynman force on each atom was less than 0.001 eV A -1 . To calculate adsorption energy, individual slab models of pristine TiO 2 (001), Nb-doped TiO 2 (001), pristine TiO 2 (011), and Nb-doped TiO 2 (011) were prepared by creating a 12 A vacuum to the zdirection in the simulation cell.A supercell containing the adsorbed CO 2 was constructed.Due to the size of the slab models and computational cost, the energetics study of CO 2 adsorption was conducted with four atomic layers without any constraint.The CO 2 molecule bound at the surface site tilted relative to the surface normal and maintained a nearly linear structure, consistent with the higher binding energy configurations of CO 2 on TiO 2 anatase. 36The interface models were relaxed using DFT without any cell relaxation to re-create the conditions of a bulk environment."

    "content": "3.1.Morphology, Microstructure, and Composition Characterization.Self-organized Nb-doped TiO 2 nanotube array samples were prepared by anodization of the Ti 0.95 Nb 0.05 alloy sheet at room temperature followed with annealing in air at 550 C for 2 h.As demonstrated in Figure 1a, the FESEM image shows the cross section of a representative Nb-doped TiO 2 nanotube array sample after heat treatment.The data confirm that a thin layer of well-organized nanotube array was formed on the Ti 0.95 Nb 0.05 alloy sheet as designed.Figure 1b shows the TEM observation of several individual nanotubes separated from the array, which further demonstrated their nanotube structure.The average diameter and the wall thickness of these nanotubes were around 100 and 15 nm, respectively.Figure 1c shows the selective area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of these individual nanotubes.These nanotubes were well polycrystallized after heat treatment, and only diffraction rings of anatase TiO 2 structure could be observed.Figure 1d shows the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis result obtained from the blue rectangular area of a Nb-doped TiO 2 nanotube.Ti, O, and Nb elements all existed in the Nb-doped TiO 2 nanotube array as expected and distributed relatively uniformly. Figure 2a shows the glancing angle X-ray diffraction (GAXRD) patterns of the pristine TiO 2 and Nb-doped TiO 2 nanotube arrays, respectively.Both samples had only anatase TiO 2 phase (JCPDS No. 21-1272), and no diffraction peaks of niobium species were observed in the XRD pattern of the Nbdoped TiO 2 nanotube array.Figure 2b shows their anatase (101) diffraction peaks at a higher magnification as a representative example.A slight shift to a lower diffraction angle of 0.15was observed for the (101) diffraction peak of the Nb-doped TiO 2 nanotube array, compared to that of the pristine TiO 2 nanotube array.The slight peak shift of the Nbdoped TiO 2 nanotube array to a lower diffraction angle could be attributed to the lattice expansion from the doping of Nb 5 with a slightly larger cation diameter (0.64 A) into the anatase lattice to replace Ti 4 with a smaller cation diameter (0.605 A). 37 Table S1 in the Supporting Information summarizes the unit cell parameters of the pristine TiO 2 and Nb-doped TiO 2 nanotube arrays, respectively.It clearly demonstrated that the unit cell parameters of the Nb-doped TiO 2 nanotube array were larger than that of the pristine TiO 2 nanotube array, which further indicated the doping of the larger Nb 5 into the anatase TiO 2 phase to replace the smaller Ti 4 .Thus, the presence of Nb atoms as confirmed by EDS analysis, the lack of XRD diffraction peaks of niobium species, the XRD peak shift toward the lower angle, and the increased unit cell parameters in Nb-doped TiO 2 nanotube array all suggested that the anatase TiO 2 lattice was successfully Nb-doped by substituting Ti atom with Nb atom. XPS analysis was conducted to examine the surface chemical compositions and states of the TiO 2 and Nb-doped TiO 2 nanotube array samples.As demonstrated in their representative XPS survey spectra (Figure 3a), Ti and O elements existed in both samples, and the existence of Nb element could only be detected in the Nb-doped TiO 2 nanotube array.C 1s peak could be observed in both samples because of the widespread presence of carbon in the environment.Figure 3b shows the highresolution Nb 3d XPS spectrum of the Nb-doped TiO 2 nanotube array sample, which demonstrated that its Nb 3d 5/2 and Nb 3d 3/2 electron binding energies were 207.3 and 210.1 eV, respectively, consistent with standard values of niobium in the pentavalent oxidation state.Figure 3c,d and O 1s peaks of the Nb-doped TiO 2 nanotube array shifted toward higher binding energy, compared with that observed for the pristine TiO 2 nanotube array.This observation is consistent with previous reports that the substitutional doping of highvalence transition-metal ions into TiO 2 could cause a positive shift of Ti 2p and O 1s peaks due to a certain level of electron drain from Ti 4 in the oxide matrix. 3839940 Thus, XPS analysis results here further proved that Nb 5 was successfully doped into anatase TiO 2 crystal lattice by substituting Ti 4 during the anodization process to create Nb-doped TiO 2 nanotube array. The electron drain from Ti 4 could create a Ti 3 defect in the Nb-doped TiO 2 nanotube array.Figure S1 in the Supporting Information shows the high-resolution XPS scans over Ti 2p peaks of the Nb-doped TiO 2 nanotube array, which demonstrated a Ti 3 2p peak with relatively weak intensity.To further verify the existence of Ti 3 , the EPR spectrum measurement was conducted.Figure 3e compares the EPR spectra of the TiO 2 and Nb-doped TiO 2 nanotube array samples.Both of them had an EPR peak at a g value of 1.998, which verified the existence of Ti 3 in both of them.The peak intensity of the Nb-doped TiO 2 nanotube array sample was much stronger than that of the TiO 2 nanotube array sample, suggesting that the Ti 3 concentration largely increased in the Nb-doped TiO 2 nanotube array sample.This observation was consistent with previous reports of Nbdoped TiO 2 , 25,41 which further verified that Nb 5 was doped into TiO 2 to replace Ti 4 during the anodization of the Ti 0.95 Nb 0.05 alloy sheet in our approach.The Nb/Ti atomic ratio in the Nb-doped TiO 2 nanotube array was further examined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).It was found that the Nb/Ti atomic ratio was 7.9:92.1 in the Nbdoped TiO 2 nanotube array sample, which was higher than the initial Nb/Ti atomic ratio in Ti/Nb alloy.This is because Nb is more stable than Ti and its existence could thus remain better in Nb-doped TiO 2 nanotube arrays during the anodization process. 31.2.Optical Properties of the Nb-Doped TiO 2 Nanotube Array.The diffuse reflectance UV-vis spectrum measurement was used to investigate the optical properties of our samples.The light absorbance spectrum can be determined by the Kubelka-Munk function given by eq 1 where R is the diffuse reflectance. 42Figure 4a compares the light absorbance spectra of TiO 2 and Nb-doped TiO 2 nanotube arrays, which demonstrated that they had similar light absorbance behaviors.Both of them demonstrated the main light absorbance within the UV light range and a weak visible light absorbance.For the TiO 2 nanotube array, its weak visible light absorbance originated from its relatively high crystal lattice distortion due to the specific nanotube architecture. 43Nbdoping did not endow a good visible light absorbance to the Nbdoped TiO 2 nanotube array.Figure 4b shows Tauc plots ((F(R) hv) 0.5 vs hv) of both samples, from which their band-gap values could be determined by the extrapolation of the Tauc plot linear region to the photon energy axis.The band-gap values of TiO 2 and Nb-doped TiO 2 nanotube arrays were 3.18 and 3.19 eV, respectively, consistent with their light absorbance performances.This observation suggested that the Nb 5 defect state introduced by Nb substitution of Ti would not be located within the anatase TiO 2 band gap but could be located above its conduction band minimum.Thus, the electronic band structure of the Nb-doped TiO 2 nanotube array determined that electrons could transfer from Nb dopants to Ti 4 .3.3.Superior Photocatalytic CO 2 Reduction Performance of the Nb-Doped TiO 2 Nanotube Array.It had been reported that Nb-doped TiO 2 systems could photocatalytically reduce CO 2 to the one-carbon product of CH 4 , CO, HCOOH, or CH 3 OH. 29,44In this work, it was found that a more desirable higher-energy compound of acetaldehyde (CH 3 CHO) was the main product of the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction by our Nbdoped TiO 2 nanotube array sample.A CO 2 -saturated NaHCO 3 aqueous solution was used for all of the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction experiments under simulated solar illumination with triethanolamine as the sacrificial agent.Figure 5a shows that the product evolution with the illumination time increases in a representative photocatalytic CO 2 reduction test by the Nbdoped TiO 2 nanotube array.This shows that CH 3 CHO production gradually increases with an increase in the illumination time.The total yield of CH 3 CHO from the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction by Nb-doped TiO 2 nanotube array was found to reach 5 mmolg -1 after 10 h reaction, corresponding to a CH 3 CHO production rate of 500 mol g -1 h -1 .In addition to CH 3 CHO, methanol (CH 3 OH) was also detected during the beginning of the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction process by the Nb-doped TiO 2 nanotube array, while its production was relatively limited and its total yield gradually decreased when the reaction time was over 6 h.After 10 h reaction, the total yield of CH 3 OH from the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction by the Nb-doped TiO 2 nanotube array was only 0.096 mmolg -1 , which was just 2 in the total products.After 24 h reaction, no CH 3 OH could be detected, which may be attributed to its oxidation to formaldehyde (CH 2 O) and formyl (HC O) by valence band (VB) holes (h ) derived from the illumination of the Nb-doped TiO 2 nanotube array, while HC O could further evolve to CH 3 CHO during the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction process. 45,46o verify that the obtained products were derived from the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction by the Nb-doped TiO 2 nanotube array four control experiments were also conducted, including (i) test with the sample, CO 2 , water, NaHCO 3 , and TEOA, but without illumination; (ii) test with CO 2 , water, NaHCO 3 , and TEOA under illumination, but without the sample; (iii) test with the sample, CO 2 , water, and NaHCO 3 under illumination, but without TEOA; and (iv) test with the sample, water, NaHCO 3 , and TEOA under illumination, but without CO 2 .Figure 5b shows the comparison result.No detectable amount of products was found in the reaction solutions for the first three control experiments, thus suggesting that illumination, photocatalyst, and sacrificial agent were all necessary to obtain appreciable photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.Although it had been reported in the literature that the use of TEOA as the sacrificial agent could not produce acetaldehyde during the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, 47 a small amount of CH 3 CHO could be found in the fourth control experiment.This observation indicates that the Nb-doped TiO 2 nanotube array could photocatalytically convert a small percent of TEOA to CH 3 CHO as the background.To exclude this effect, in all reported CH 3 CHO production data the background CH 3 CHO production was subtracted to ensure their accuracy. Figure 5c shows the CH 3 CHO production rates determined from five consecutive 24 h runs for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction by Nb-doped TiO 2 nanotube array.After each run, the simulated solar illumination was turned off, and the used Nbdoped TiO 2 nanotube array sample was collected, washed, dried, and then redispersed in a fresh reaction solution for the next run.As shown in Figure 5c, the production of CH 3 CHO through the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction by Nb-doped TiO 2 nanotube array under simulated solar illumination was quite stable, and the production rate fluctuation could be attributed to the unavoidable changes in experimental conditions between different runs.Even after repeated long time reactions, the Nb-doped TiO 2 nanotube array was found to maintain a relatively stable CH 3 CHO production rate.Figures S2 andS3 in the Supporting Information show SEM, XRD, and XPS analysis results of the Nb-doped TiO 2 nanotube array after five consecutive 24 h runs.No obvious changes were found compared with that of its fresh counterparts, which further verified its excellent stability.The average CH 3 CHO production rate for the 24 h reaction was determined at 572 molg -1 h -1 , and its product selectivity toward CH 3 CHO was still over 99. Figure 5d compares the CH 3 CHO production amount by the pristine TiO 2 and Nb-doped TiO 2 nanotube arrays after 24 h reaction.The CH 3 CHO production rate for the 24 h reaction of the TiO 2 nanotube array was determined to be less than 200 molg -1 h -1 , which clearly demonstrated that the defect engineering approach of Nb-doping was critical to enhance the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance of the Nb-doped TiO 2 nanotube array.To further explore the Nb-doping content effect on the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance of Nbdoped TiO 2 nanotube arrays, another two samples with Nb/Ti atomic ratios at 2.5 and 10, respectively, were prepared.It was found that their main photocatalytic CO 2 reduction product was also CH 3 CHO, and their average CH 3 CHO production rates were 365 and 465 molg -1 h -1 for Nb/Ti atomic ratios at 2.5 and 10, respectively.Thus, the Nb-TiO 2 nanotube array sample with the Nb/Ti atomic ratio at 5 had the best performance among these samples and so it was used in our study.Table 1 summarizes the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performances of various photocatalysts reported in the literature with CH 3 CHO as one of the major products, compared with that of the Nb-doped TiO 2 nanotube array.It clearly shows that the Nb-doped TiO 2 nanotube array possessed superior photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance on both the CH 3 CHO production rate and product selectivity.As a higher-energy compound product, CH 3 CHO is more preferable to the gaseous products of the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction (for example, methane) in most applications due to its easy transportation/storage and higher-energy density.Furthermore, it could also be used to produce acetic acid, ethanol, ethyl acetate, and a number of other key chemicals as intermediates.Thus, the high CH 3 CHO production rate and product selectivity of the Nb-doped TiO 2 nanotube array could be endowed with great application potential. 3.4.Adsorption and Activation of CO 2 Molecules on Nb-Doped TiO 2 Nanotube Array.A good capability of adsorption and activation of CO 2 molecules on a photocatalyst's surface is the prerequisite for its subsequent successful photocatalytic reduction.Thus, the adsorption and activation of CO 2 on the surface of Nb-doped TiO 2 were investigated both computationally and experimentally to illustrate the contribution of Nb-doping on the superior photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance of Nb-doped TiO 2 nanotube array.To study the adsorption of CO 2 , we considered the ideal experimental geometry of a CO 2 motif and used starting geometries consistent with the idealized structure.Binding energies are calculated from eq 2 where E binding is the zero-temperature DFT binding energy of CO 2 , E(CO 2 slab) is the total energy of the pristine TiO 2 CO 2 system or the Nb-doped TiO 2 CO 2 adduct, E(slab) is the total energy of the isolated pristine or Nb-doped TiO 2 slab, and E(CO 2 ) is the total energy of the isolated CO 2 molecules, relaxed in a 20 A edge-length box to ensure that the effect of interaction between the periodic images is minimized.Figure 6a,b shows schematic views of a relaxed slab model with four layers representing the pristine and Nb-doped anatase TiO 2 (001) surfaces, respectively.It was found that the O atom of the CO 2 molecule formed bonds with Ti or Nb on their surfaces.To construct the model of a Nb-doped anatase TiO 2 (001) surface, a surface Ti atom was substituted by a Nb atom and a CO 2 molecule was adsorbed on the Nb-doped TiO 2 surface around the doped Nb atom.To simplify the atomic model assembly process, a 25 Nb surface doping concentration was used.Figure 6c compares the calculated binding energy of CO 2 on pristine and Nb-doped TiO 2 (001) surfaces.The adsorption energy value for pristine TiO 2 (001) surface was consistent with results reported in the literature, 16 thus confirming the validity of the model employed.It was found that the CO 2 adsorption energy for the Nb-doped TiO 2 (001) surface was much higher than that for the pristine TiO 2 (001) surface.The adsorption of CO 2 on the (011) surfaces of both TiO 2 and Nb-doped TiO 2 was further calculated and compared.It was found that the adsorption of CO 2 on the (011) surface of TiO 2 was actually unfavorable with a negative adsorption energy of -19.5 kJ mol -1 , while it was reversed by Nb-doping to a favorable state for the adsorption of CO 2 on the (011) surface of Nb-doped TiO 2 with a positive adsorption energy of 40.0 kJ mol -1 .Thus, first-principles calculations indicated that Nbdoping could largely increase the affinity of CO 2 on the TiO 2 surface.Figure 6d shows the CO 2 experimental adsorption performances on the pristine TiO 2 and Nb-doped TiO 2 nanotube array samples, respectively.To avoid the surface area effect, the CO 2 adsorption data were normalized by the corresponding surface area.The results show that the adsorption of CO 2 was always stronger on the Nb-doped TiO 2 surface than on the pristine TiO 2 surface within the relative pressure range investigated, consistent with the results of the first-principles calculations.Thus, both the calculation and experimental results suggested that Nb-doping enhanced the CO 2 adsorption on the TiO 2 surface as we expected. First-principles calculations also suggested that the CO bond length of CO 2 molecule increased from 1.18 to 1.21 A and the OCO angle changes from 180(linear state) to 161(bent state) after it was adsorbed onto Nb-doped TiO 2 (001) surface.Both the increase in the CO bond length and the bending of OCO angle clearly indicated the activation of CO 2 molecules on the Nb-doped TiO 2 surface.To experimentally confirm the activation of CO 2 , an XPS study was conducted on both pristine TiO 2 and Nb-doped TiO 2 nanotube array samples after they were dispersed into CO 2 -saturated aqueous NaHCO 3 (0.1 M) with a continuous high-purity CO 2 gas flow in the dark for 30 min to expel the dissolved oxygen in the vessel and reach the adsorption/desorption equilibrium.The samples were then collected by centrifugation and dried in a vacuum oven at 60 C before the XPS analysis.Figure 7a shows the high-resolution C 1s XPS spectra of pristine TiO 2 and Nbdoped TiO 2 nanotube array samples, respectively.The C 1s peak of the pristine TiO 2 nanotube array sample could be best fitted by the combination of two peaks at 284.6 eV (carbon in the environment) and 285.6 eV (CH x hydrocarbon fragments from CO 2 and H 2 O reactions by oxygen vacancy activation), while the C 1s peak of the Nb-doped TiO 2 nanotube array sample could be best fitted by the combination of four peaks at 284.6 eV, 285.6 eV, 286.3 eV (CO), and 288.4 eV (CO 2 -, an activated state species of CO 2 after gaining one electron). 565775859 This XPS observation suggested that compared with the pristine TiO 2 nanotube array, the Nb-doped TiO 2 nanotube array surface with high-density electrons promoted the formation of activated CO 2 -species before illumination.Figure 7b shows the highresolution O 1s XPS spectra of pristine TiO 2 and Nb-doped TiO 2 nanotube array samples, respectively, which demonstrated the same difference.For both samples, three peaks at 530.1, 531.1, and 532.4 eV were identified, which could be assigned to oxygen species in the lattice (O L ), bonded to Ti 3 , and chemisorbed (O C ), 58,606162 respectively.However, a peak at 531.4 eV was only identified on the O 1s XPS spectrum of the Nb-doped TiO 2 nanotube array sample, which could be assigned to oxygen species in CO 2 -. 63This observation was consistent with the C 1s XPS spectra, which further verified that Nb-doping could be beneficial for the formation of the activated CO 2 - species.These activated CO 2 -species could be readily transformed into formate and methoxy species and subsequently into acetaldehyde in the presence of protons 2 when simulated solar illumination was switched on. 3.5.Photocatalytic CO 2 Reduction Process and Mechanism on Nb-Doped TiO 2 Nanotube Array Samples.XPS analysis was also conducted on the Nb-doped TiO 2 nanotube array sample after a series of reaction time to illustrate its photocatalytic CO 2 reduction process and shed light on the reduction mechanism.After the desired reaction time, the samples were collected by centrifugation and dried in a vacuum oven at 60 C before the XPS analysis.Figure 8a shows the highresolution C 1s XPS spectra of Nb-doped TiO 2 nanotube array samples after 2, 5, and 10 h photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction.Compared with their counterparts without illumination (see Figure 7a), we found that the CH x hydrocarbon fragment peak (285.6 eV) disappeared, indicating that they could be consumed during CO 2 reduction.Two new peaks corresponding to formate (HCOOH, 287.3 eV) and methoxy (-O-CH 3 , 285.2 eV) species were visible on these C 1s XPS spectra, indicating that they are reaction intermediate species occurring during the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 by the Nbdoped TiO 2 nanotube array to finally produce CH 3 CHO.The CO 2 -peak (284.4eV) could still be observed on these three C 1s XPS spectra.Figure 8b shows the high-resolution O 1s XPS spectra of Nb-doped TiO 2 nanotube array samples after 2, 5, and 10 h photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction, respectively.It demonstrated that the peak belonging to the oxygen species in CO 2 -(531.4eV) could also be identified on these three O 1s XPS spectra, consistent with XPS analysis results on C 1s.Thus, these XPS analysis results suggested that the activated CO 2 species were continuously formed by the Nb-doped TiO 2 nanotube array for its superior photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance.XPS analysis was also conducted on the pristine TiO 2 nanotube array sample after a series of reaction time (see Figure S4 in the Supporting Information).It showed a similar occurrence of CO 2 -, HCOOH, and -O-CH 3 but with a longer illumination time, which indicated a lower activity of the pristine TiO 2 nanotube array, as demonstrated in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction tests. Due to their similar crystal structure, morphology, and particle size, the only evident difference between pristine TiO 2 and Nb-doped TiO 2 nanotube arrays was the Nb-doping.It has been reported previously that substitutional doping of Nb 5 to replace Ti 4 could result in the formation of acid centers with a positive charge due to its higher valence. 64Thus, an attraction exists between the lone-electron pair outside of the O atom of CO 2 and acid centers of Nb-doped TiO 2 surface from the Coulomb force to enhance the adsorption of CO 2 onto the Nbdoped TiO 2 surface for a better photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance than pristine TiO 2 as verified by our calculation and experimental investigation.It had been reported in the literature that defective TiO 2 with Ti 3 defects could have excess electrons to promote the activation of CO 2 . 3,15,65,66The Nbdoping into TiO 2 lattice by replacing Ti 4 could be described by eq 3 A new equilibrium in the material system should be reestablished, and extra Ti 3 defects could be created to reach the equilibrium after the doping process. 25,67XPS scans over O 1s peaks (see Figures 7b,8b, and S4b) also showed that the percentage of oxygen bonded to Ti 3 species in the Nb-doped TiO 2 nanotube array was evidently higher than that in the pristine TiO 2 nanotube array either in dark conditions or under illumination and generally stable, which verified the capability to create and maintain Ti 3 defects by Nb-doping.Thus, Nbdoping of the TiO 2 nanotube array could enhance the CO 2 activation as verified by both calculation and experimental investigations, which also contributed to its demonstrated superior photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance.The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction is a relatively complicated, multielectron reaction process involving various reactants, intermediates, and products, and the exact reaction pathway is still in debate. 2 From both the literature 4,46,48495068 and our investigation results, a possible mechanism for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction by the Nb-doped TiO 2 nanotube array with water as the reductant and TEOA as the sacrificial agent could be proposed as shown in the following eqs 4-15 CH OH h e H CO 2H Illumination of Nb-doped TiO 2 nanotube array with simulated sunlight generates electrons (e -) and holes (h ) on its conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB), respectively (eq 4).Photogenerated holes react with TEOA to be consumed by producing TEOA (eq 5), which largely reduces their interference with photogenerated electrons in a series of reduction reactions.These TEOA molecules with positive charges could further react with hydroxyl ions to yield electrically neutral TEOA, which subsequently continues to serve as the sacrificial agent (eq 7).Photogenerated electrons react with water to yield protons in the photocatalytic watersplitting reaction (eq 6), and they also transfer to active sites on Nb-doped TiO 2 surface to participate in CO 2 reduction reactions with adsorbed CO 2 molecules and as-generated protons to form HCOOH, H 2 CO, and CH 3 OH (eqs 9-11). No HCOOH was detected as a product during the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction process (see Figure 5a), while XPS analysis demonstrated its existence on the Nb-doped TiO 2 surface (see Figure 8).It had been reported in the literature that HCOOH could be reduced to HC O and OH -(eq 12). 69hus, HCOOH and HCHO (reduction product of HCOOH) should be reaction intermediates during the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction process by the Nb-doped TiO 2 nanotube array, and the final product of CH 3 CHO could be produced by the dimerization of HC O (the reduction product of HCOOH) into glyoxal (CHOCHO) followed with its successive reduction (eq 15).HCHO could be further reduced to CH 3 OH (eq 11) but it had been found that the detected small amount of CH 3 OH gradually disappeared with the elongation of the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction process.This observation may be attributed to its oxidation to formaldehyde (H 2 CO) and formyl (HC O) by valence band holes (h ) derived from the illumination of the Nbdoped TiO 2 nanotube array (eqs 13 and 14), 45 while HC O could be converted to CHOCHO (eq 15).Thus, a high product selectivity to CHOCHO was achieved in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction process by a Nb-doped TiO 2 nanotube array."

    "content": "In summary, a novel defect engineering approach of Nb-doping was found to be effective to enhance the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance in a highly ordered TiO 2 nanotube array.Substitutional doping of a higher valence Nb 5 to replace Ti 4 was found to lead to the formation of acid centers with positive charges and simultaneously create/maintain Ti 3 defect, which enhanced both the adsorption and activation of CO 2 on the Nbdoped TiO 2 surface.Both experimental and theoretical investigations confirmed that the CO 2 adsorption on the surface of Nb-doped TiO 2 was largely enhanced than on the pristine TiO 2 surface.The adsorbed CO 2 molecules were effectively activated into CO 2 -species to lower the CO 2 reduction reaction barrier, which endowed it with a superior photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance under simulated solar illumination.The main product of acetaldehyde could be easily transported/ stored and possesses a high energy density suitable for various potential applications.Notably, the acetaldehyde production rate was measured over 500 molg -1 h -1 with good stability for repeated long-time uses, and it also demonstrated a superior product selectivity to acetaldehyde of over 99.Thus, the highvalence cation doping of TiO 2 may be a promising defect engineering approach to improve the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance.
