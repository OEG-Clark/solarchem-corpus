    "content": "Al-doped strontium titanite (Al-SrTiO 3 ) containing numerous stepwise edges on the surface was found to exhibit an excellent performance in the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 by H 2 O as an electron donor under photoirradiation at 300 nm with Ag modification, while in contrast, the Ag-loaded pristine SrTiO 3 was inactive as a photocatalyst for this reaction.CO was stably evolved as the main reduction product at a rate of 7.2 mol h -1 over the Ag-loaded Al-SrTiO 3 , and a small amount of H 2 was generated during the three runs.The selectivity of electrons generated by charge transfer toward CO evolution was 98.0.In addition, the stoichiometric formation of O 2 was observed, indicating that H 2 O acts as an electron donor for the reduction of CO 2 .Furthermore, isotopic experiments performed using 13 CO 2 revealed that the CO product is derived from CO 2 bubbled into an aqueous solution of NaHCO 3 and not from residual carbon species on the catalyst surface."

    "content": "Preparation of the Al-Doped SrTiO 3 .Al-doped SrTiO 3 photocatalysts were fabricated via a flux method using anhydrous SrCl 2 as the flux reagent. 24More specifically, a mixture of SrTiO 3 (99.9,Wako, Japan), Al 2 O 3 (50 nm particle size, Sigma-Aldrich, Germany), and anhydrous SrCl 2 (98.0,Kanto Chemical Co., Inc., Japan) were added to an alumina mortar and ground for 10 min.The molar ratio of SrCl 2 :SrTiO 3 was fixed at 10.0.The ground mixture was then transferred into an alumina crucible and calcined at 1423 K under air for 15 h.Various Al-doped SrTiO 3 species were prepared by adjusting the molar ratio of Al 2 O 3 to SrTiO 3 in the mixture, and these samples were termed x mol Al-SrTiO 3 , where x represents the molar ratio of Al to Ti, i.e., 0, 2, 4, or 16.For comparison, bare SrTiO 3 photocatalysts without Al doping were also calcined by using the flux reagent in an yttria crucible (i.e., 0 mol SrTiO 3 -Y). Loading of the Cocatalyst.An Ag cocatalyst was employed to modify the surface of the as-prepared Al-SrTiO 3 photocatalyst via a chemical reduction method.More specifically, Al-SrTiO 3 (0.75 g) was dispersed in deionized ultrapure water (50 mL), and a 0.1 M aqueous solution of AgNO 3 (0.695 mL) and a 0.4 M aqueous solution of NaH 2 PO 2 (0.75 mL) were added to the suspension.After the suspension was maintained at a constant temperature of 353 K for 1.5 h, it was filtered and then dried under air at 298 K overnight. Characterization.The structure and crystalline nature of the prepared Al-SrTiO 3 were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Rigaku Ultima IV powder diffractometer equipped with a Cu K ( 0.154056 nm) radiation source and using a voltage and current of 40 kV and 40 mA, respectively.UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-vis DRS) was performed using a JASCO V-670 spectrometer equipped with an integrating sphere.Spectralon, which was supplied by Labsphere Inc., was used as a standard reflection sample.Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (SU-8220, Hitachi High-Technologies) equipped with an energy-dispersive Xray spectroscopy (EDS) unit at an acceleration voltage of 15.0 kV.The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area was measured by N 2 adsorption at 77 K using a volumetric gas adsorption apparatus (BELmini, Bel Japan, Inc.).X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed by using an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (ESCA 3400, Shimadzu Corp.), and the chemical concentrations of the various atoms at various points among the depth profiles were observed via Ar ion sputtering (Emission 10 mA; Accel HT: 0.5 kV).Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES, iCAP7400, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) was used to determine the metal compositions in the Al-SrTiO 3 . Photocatalytic Reaction.The photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 by H 2 O was performed in a CO 2 flowing batch system with an innerirradiation-type reaction vessel at 25 C and under ambient pressure.Ag-loaded Al-SrTiO 3 (0.5 g) was dispersed in a 0.1 M aqueous solution of NaHCO 3 (1.0L), and CO 2 gas (99.999) was bubbled into the suspension at a flow rate of 30 mL min -1 .The suspension was then irradiated using a 400 W high-pressure Hg lamp with a Pyrex jacket connected to a water-cooling system to cut off any light with a wavelength of 300 nm.The gaseous products evolved from the photoreaction system (e.g., H 2 , O 2 , and CO) were detected by thermal conductivity detector-gas chromatography (TCD-GC) using a GC-8A chromatograph (Shimadzu Corp.) equipped with a 5 A molecular sieve column with Ar as the carrier gas and by flame ionization detector-gas chromatography (FID-GC) using a methanizer and a ShinCarbon ST column with N 2 as the carrier gas.In the isotope-labeling experiment, 12 CO 2 gas was replaced with 13 CO 2 .The formation of 13 CO and 12 CO under photoirradiation was analyzed by using a quadrupole-type mass spectrometer (BEL Japan, Inc., BEL Mass) combined with TCD-GC using Ar as the carrier gas."

    "content": "We initially examined the effect of varying the quantity of the Al precursor, and so 0 (0 mol Al vs Ti), 2, 4, and 16 mol Al-doped SrTiO 3 samples were fabricated via a flux method in an alumina crucible.The 0 mol Al-doped SrTiO 3 sample (0 mol SrTiO 3 -Y) was also obtained via calcining SrTiO 3 and flux SrCl 2 in an yttria crucible in the absence of Al 2 O 3 to avoid any influence from Al present in the crucible material.The crystal structures of the pristine SrTiO 3 and the various prepared Al-SrTiO 3 species were measured by using XRD, as shown in Figure 1A, where all diffraction peaks could be assigned to the pure phase of SrTiO 3 with a Pm-3m (211) space group (ICSD 23076).No peaks were observed corresponding to Al species (Figure 1A), and the XRD peaks shifted to the higher angle slightly (Figure 1B), thereby indicating that Al is highly dispersed within the SrTiO 3 bulk.It is known that the ionic radius of the six-coordinated Ti 4 (0.605 A) is slightly larger than that of Al 3 (0.535 A), 42 and so when Al 3 ions replace the Ti 4 ions present at the B sites of the perovskite structure, the Bragg equation states that the diffraction pattern should shift to higher angles.The small shift observed in Figure 1B therefore appears to confirm that the Al 3 ions occupied the B sites of the SrTiO 3 perovskite.In addition, as shown in Figure 1C, the lattice spacing of the (110) plane decreases linearly upon increasing the amount of Al species from 0 to 2.16 mol , as determined by ICP-OES (Table S1), indicating that almost all Al species were doped into the catalyst.However, the lattice spacing of the (110) plane at an Al content of 4.59 mol did not exhibit a linear tendency, indicating that only some of the Al species were doped into the catalyst.It is likely that the excess Al was present on the surface of the catalyst. 43,44The ICP-OES analysis suggested that the pristine SrTiO 3 , 0 mol SrTiO 3 -Y, and 0 mol Al-SrTiO 3 also contained 0.63, 0.68, and 1.50 Al, respectively (Table S1).Nevertheless, no obvious peaks for Al 2p were detected in the case of the pristine SrTiO 3 or the 0 mol SrTiO 3 -Y samples, as shown in Figure S1.Thus, the tiny amount of Al detected at 0.7 can be attributed to the background level during ICP-OES measurements.The XPS Y 3d spectrum for the 0 mol SrTiO 3 -Y sample is given in Figure S1d. Figure 2 shows the SEM images of the pristine SrTiO 3 , the 0 mol SrTiO 3 -Y, and the 0, 2, 4, and 16 mol Al-doped SrTiO 3 fabricated via the flux method in an alumina crucible.As shown in Figure 2a, a formless microstructure was observed for the pristine SrTiO 3 , and the BET surface area was 3.7 m 2 g -1 .In contrast, the 0 mol SrTiO 3 -Y and 0 mol Al-SrTiO 3 samples were essentially cubic in structure, with some larger particles being observed than for the pristine SrTiO 3 .However, several smaller particles were also present (Figure 2b,c; see Figure S2 for more details).We also noted that the surface of 0 mol Al-SrTiO 3 was less smooth than that of 0 mol SrTiO 3 -Y, and the BET surface areas of the 0 mol SrTiO 3 -Y and 0 mol Al-SrTiO 3 samples were 1.1 and 1.8 m 2 g -1 , respectively (see Table S1 for further details).In the presence of varying amounts of doped Al, the shapes and sizes of the SrTiO 3 catalysts were similar to that of the irregularly shaped pristine SrTiO 3 ; however, the morphological structure changed, and several smooth facets of the polygonous Al- SrTiO 3 bulk were surrounded by numerous nanosteps, as shown in Figure 2g-i.This observation revealed that Al doping resulted in a decrease in the particle size and an increase in the number of stepwise edges on the samples, which is similar to the case of the alkaline earth metal-doped NaTaO 3 . 30,31It should be noted that these nanostep defects may suppress the crystal growth of SrTiO 3 during calcination. UV-vis DR spectra of various SrTiO 3 samples were then collected as shown in Figure S3, and the absorption edges were observed at 390 nm, which corresponds with previous reports. 22,24,45However, the absorption edges of the fluxtreated samples 0 mol SrTiO 3 -Y and 0 mol Al-SrTiO 3 shifted slightly to higher wavelengths. The dependence of Al doping on the photoreduction of CO 2 to CO was then examined, as presented in Figure 3.It should be noted that the efficiency of CO evolution increased significantly after the doping of Al into SrTiO 3 .Interestingly, the formation rates of CO, H 2 , and O 2 over 0 mol Al-SrTiO 3 were significantly higher than those over 0 mol SrTiO 3 -Y and over the pristine SrTiO 3 .It is possible that Al species originating from the alumina crucible may be doped into the SrTiO 3 photocatalyst, thereby enhancing the photocatalytic activity for the reduction of CO 2 . 24Indeed, ICP results (as shown in Table S1) suggested that 0 mol Al-SrTiO 3 contains a significantly greater quantity of Al than 0 mol SrTiO 3 -Y.It should also be noted here that 0 mol Al-SrTiO 3 exhibited a significantly lower photocatalytic activity than 2 mol Al-SrTiO 3 , despite 0 mol Al-SrTiO 3 containing a significant amount of Al.This could be attributed to the particle size of 0 mol Al-SrTiO 3 being larger than that of the other Al-SrTiO 3 species, thereby resulting in a lower BET surface area (see Figure 2 and Table S1).On the other hand, numerous nanosteps on the surface of the 2 mol Al-SrTiO 3 formed by the Al doping and the welldispersed Al dopant might have an important impact on the photocatalytic performance of the photocatalyst by promoting the charge separation. 31,46Among the various Al-SrTiO 3 species, 4 mol Al-SrTiO 3 exhibited the highest rate of CO evolution, at a rate of 7.2 mol h -1 , while the formation rates of H 2 and O 2 were 0.15 and 3.58 mol h -1 , respectively.Moreover, no differences were observed between the XRD patterns of the Ag-loaded Al-doped SrTiO 3 after the reaction (Figure S4), thereby suggesting that the crystal structure of Al-SrTiO 3 is stable during the photocatalytic reaction.The Ag/Al-SrTiO 3 and latest CO 2 reduction photocatalysts that act in aqueous solutions under irradiation are summarized in Table S2. The above results therefore indicated that Al doping could significantly improve the activity of the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 by H 2 O over Al-SrTiO 3 under photoirradiation at 300 nm.To uncover the underlying cause of the photocatalytic performance enhancement of Al-SrTiO 3 , it is necessary to investigate the position of Al in the Al-SrTiO 3 structure.Noble gas sputtering (5 s bursts) was therefore employed to observe the chemical composition of Al-SrTiO 3 at various points among the depth profiles. 47Thus, Figure 4a shows the Al 2p XPS results for the 4 mol Al-SrTiO 3 with various Ar sputtering times.The intensity of the Al 2p peak gradually decreased upon increasing the sputtering time.Normally, the molar ratio of Sr to Ti in the SrTiO 3 should be 1:1, and so if Al 3 replaces the sites of Ti 4 , the ratio of Sr to the total amount of Al and Ti in Al-SrTiO 3 should be equal to the value of Sr to Ti in the pristine SrTiO 3 .The atomic ratios of Sr, Ti, and Al to the total amount of Ti and Al were therefore calculated from the area of the peaks (as shown in 4b).It is important to note that at the surface of the pristine SrTiO 3 the molar ratio of Sr to Ti is higher than inside the photocatalyst, and the molar ratio becomes stable at 120 after sputtering for 10 s (see Figure S5 for more details).The value of Sr/(Ti Al) before sputtering is lower than after sputtering for 5 s, suggesting that a few Al species existed on the surface as Al 2 O 3 or other derivatives.During the initial 25 s of Ar ion sputtering, the atomic concentration of Al decreased sharply, and the concentration of Ti increased.This was followed by the atomic concentrations of Al and Ti gradually becoming stable around 10.0, which is nearly 4.6 times higher than the Al concentration detected by the ICP-OES.It should be noted that the concentrations of atoms estimated by XPS (as shown in Figure 4) were not perfectly accurate, since they were found to be inconsistent with those observed by ICP-OES.However, it is common in XPS analysis to estimate the ratio of each element, since not all particles are etched in the same proportion, and it is also difficult to employ exact atomic sensitivity factors (ASF).However, the XPS measurements clearly showed the elemental distribution of Al-SrTiO 3 .The value of Sr to Ti and Al became stable at 110 after 5 s of Ar ion sputtering.The XPS results therefore suggest that Al species exist on the surface of Al-SrTiO 3 , although a small quantity of alumina is also present on the catalyst surface, and some of the Al atoms replace the Ti sites in the perovskite structure.In view of the obtained XRD patterns and SEM images, we concluded that when Al atoms replace the Ti sites, several defects are formed on the edges of the perovskite SrTiO 3 layers due to the unmatched ionic radii and valence states, which restrict growth of the crystal cell during calcination, thereby resulting in the formation of nanosteps. Furthermore, it is important to confirm the effect of the reaction conditions on the formation rates of the photocatalytic products.As shown in Figure 5a, no product evolution was observed in the absence of photoirradiation, and only small quantities of O 2 were detected without a photocatalyst.In the absence of a Ag cocatalyst (Figure 5c), the selectivity toward CO evolution was particularly poor (9.5), and the formation rates of H 2 and O 2 were only 0.99 and 0.51 mol h -1 (Figure 5c), respectively.The total photocatalytic activity shown in Figure 5d in the absence of the NaHCO 3 additive remained low, although the selectivity toward CO evolution was high at 82.2.The formation rate of CO decreased when using Ar gas instead of bubbling CO 2 gas.In addition, the pH value of the suspension under Ar bubbling increased from 9.14 to 9.22 during the reaction, which was significantly higher than that in the absence of NaHCO 3 additives (i.e., 3.55; see Figure S6a,b).Moreover, the best photocatalytic performance was observed for the Ag-loaded Al-SrTiO 3 with CO 2 bubbling and NaHCO 3 addition under irradiation, as the pH value of the suspension was maintained stable at 6.88 during the reaction (see Figure S6c).These can therefore be considered independent factors during the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 in an aqueous solution.In addition, the stoichiometric formation of O 2 was detected, thereby indicating that H 2 O acted as an electron donor. Stability is one of the most important factors in estimating the properties of photocatalysts.Thus, Figure 6 shows the time-dependent evolution of CO, H 2 , and O 2 as products during the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 by H 2 O as an electron donor under photoirradiation conditions.It should be noted that the photocatalysts were vacuum-filtered, washed with ultrapure water, and dried under air at room temperature for every 5 h of photoreaction carried out.The balance of e -/ h was found to be 1.0, which indicates that H 2 O successfully functions as an electron donor during the whole reaction.The formation rate of O 2 did not decrease significantly during the reaction, although the formation rate of CO slightly decreased after 15 h.These results suggest that the prepared Ag/Al-SrTiO 3 is stable during the photocatalytic reaction.The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 reaction was also performed over Ag/Al-SrTiO 3 on the 1.0 L scale (0.1 M NaHCO 3 (aq)) with constant CO 2 bubbling over 10 h (Figure S7).Thus, after 10 h of the photocatalytic reaction, the selectivity to CO evolution was found to decrease slightly.The SEM images of Ag/Al-SrTiO 3 before and after the reaction are shown in Figure S8, where it is apparent that the Ag nanoparticles on Ag/Al-SrTiO 3 became aggregated following the photocatalytic reaction. To confirm that the CO was derived from CO 2 bubbled into the aqueous solution rather than from any organic contaminants present in the photocatalytic reaction system, isotopelabeling experiments were performed using 13 CO 2 over the Ag loaded Al-SrTiO 3 photocatalyst.Thus, Figure 7 shows the obtained GC and MS (m/z 28, 29) results for the reaction, where peaks corresponding to H 2 , N 2 , O 2 , and CO were observed at 2.2, 4.1, 6.1, and 14.2 min in the TCD-GC chromatogram, respectively.In addition, the peak at 6.0 min in the m/z 28 spectrum was assigned to N 2 from the air, since the peak position was the same as that monitored by TCD-GC, and no peaks corresponding to 12 CO were detected.Moreover, the peak observed in the m/z 29 spectrum, which was assigned to 13 CO gas, appeared at the same retention time as that monitored by TCD-GC.This result indicated that the CO evolved over the Ag-loaded Al-SrTiO 3 catalyst was derived from the introduced CO 2 gas."
