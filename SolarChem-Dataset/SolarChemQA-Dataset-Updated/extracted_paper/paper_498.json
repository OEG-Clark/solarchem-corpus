    "content": "Photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) into valuable hydrocarbon such as methane (CH 4 ) using water as reducing agent is a good strategy for environment and energy applications.In this study, a facile and simple sol-gel method was employed for the synthesis of metal (Cu and Ag) loaded nanosized N/TiO 2 photocatalyst.The prepared photocatalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, BET Surface area analyzer, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and UV-vis diffuses reflectance spectroscopy.The photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 into methane was carried out under visible light irradiation (420 nm) by prepared photocatalysts in order to evaluate the photocatalytic efficiency.The results demonstrate that Ag loaded N/TiO 2 showed enhanced photocatalytic performance for methane production from CO 2 compared to other Cu-N/TiO 2 , N/TiO 2 and TiO 2 photocatalysts.The improvement in the photocatalytic activity could be attributed to high specific surface area, extended visible light absorption and suppressed recombination of electronhole pair due to synergistic effects of silver and nitrogen in the Ag-N/TiO 2 photocatalyst.This study demonstrates that Ag-N/TiO 2 is a promising photocatalytic material for photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 into hydrocarbons under visible light irradiation."

    "content": "In the typical process, the nitrogen doped TiO 2 and metal ions (MCu and Ag) and nitrogen co-doped TiO 2 were prepared using solgel method according to our previous study with little modification 29.Firstly, required amount of tetra-butyl titanate was slowly dissolved in a mix solution of ethanol and acetic acid (4010 ml) and stirred for half an hour at room temperature (Solution A).Secondly, the required amount of urea, Cu(NO 3 ) 2 3H 2 O or Ag NO 3 were dissolved in 25 ml mix solution of ethanol and acetic acid (205 ml) under vigorous stirring at room temperature for 20 min (solution B).Then in the next step, solution B was added drop wise to solution A with rate 2 ml per minute under vigorous stirring within 12.5 min.For homogeneous solution, the mixture was stirrer for another 3 h at 50 C.After this, obtained mixture was kept at room temperature in air for 24 h to form homogeneous gel.The prepared TiO 2 based gels were dried at 80 C in microwave oven for 10 h.The finally obtained powders were calcined at 450 C for 3 h in the muffle furnace.The molar ratio of TiO 2 to urea was controlled as 1:2 in all nitrogen doped and co-doped samples, while Cu and Ag ratio to TiO 2 were used as1 atm. and 0.09 wt respectively which were previously optimized in our reports 30,31. The crystalline structural properties were studied using X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku D/max-3B) with Cu K radiation (V40 kV, I36 mA).The transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-1200EX electron microscope) operated at 200 kV was used for particle size and shape.The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET, ASAP 2020) surface areas (SBET) of the samples were calculated by nitrogen physisorption on a nitrogen adsorption apparatus at 77 K (Micromeritics Instruments).For the determination of electronic states and composition of prepared samples, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (Thermo-VG Scientific, ESCALAB250, monochromatic Al K Xray source) was used and binding energies were referenced to the C 1s peak of adventitious carbon at 284.8 eV.The UV/Vis diffuse reflectance spectra were measured on HITACHI U-4100 UV-vis spectrometer using BaSO 4 as a reference standard.The photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra were obtained using a HITACHI F-4500 Fluorescence spectrophotometer at excitation wavelength of 380 nm at room temperature. The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 was performed in a gas closed circulation system under visible light irradiation at controlled temperature of 288 K with pressure of around 1.25 atm.A 300 W xenon lamp (Perfect Light PLSSXE300) with an optical filter (420 nm) was used as a light source.Certain amount of catalyst (50 mg) dispersed in deionized water (100 ml) by ultrasonic treatment in the reaction system.After evacuating the photo reactor, compressed CO 2 was purged into the system from inlet tube in the cylindrical quartz reactor.The resultant gas samples were analyzed online using a gas chromatograph (Agilent 7890A)."

    "content": "X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were carried out to deter- ).Among these XRD patterns, no noticeable change is observed because all samples consist of anatase as the major crystalline phase.Moreover, there were no diffraction peaks corresponding to metal or metal oxide species of doping elements suggesting that dopant ions were incorporated into structure of TiO 2 or were too small to be detected by XRD.The average crystallite sizes of the samples were estimated using Scherer equation and the obtained sizes are approximately 12.6, 12.1, 11.6 and 11.4 nm for TiO 2 , N/TiO 2 , Ag-N/TiO 2 and Cu-N/TiO 2 respectively as shown in Table 1.As can be seen from the values, the crystallite size of Ag-N/TiO 2 is smaller compared to all other samples, showing that silver and nitrogen codoped TiO 2 sample were highly crystallized. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to investigate the size and shape of the prepared nanoparticles.The Fig. 2A shows the image of pure TiO 2 sample which consists of nanoparticles with diameter of 8-10 nm.Fig. 4B-D illustrate the images of N/TiO 2 , Ag-N/TiO 2 and Cu-N/TiO 2 respectively.The images of these samples also demonstrate the similar results with particle size in the same range as for pure TiO 2 . Broadly speaking, high specific surface areas and large pore volumes of the photocatalysts are helpful for the enhancement of photocatalytic performance, owing to increased adsorption of reactant molecules, rapid transportation of reactant molecules and products 32.The adsorption-desorption isotherms (Fig. 3A) shows a type IV isotherm with type H 2 hysteresis loops for the capillary and wormlike pores, indicating the characteristics of mesoporous materials 33.The BET analysis confirms that Ag-N/TiO 2 sample has higher specific surface area (162.4 m 2 g -1 ) compared to Cu-N/TiO 2 (151.5 m 2 g -1 ) and N/TiO 2 (147.6 m 2 g -1 ), TiO 2 (141.4 m 2 g -1 ) samples.The Fig. 3B shows the pore size distribution curves derived from desorption branch of the nitrogen isotherms by the BJH method.The average peak pore diameter is about 10 nm for all the samples, clearly showing the mesoporous structure.Moreover, Ag deposited N/TiO 2 sample having higher surface area along with porous structure might provide efficient transport pathways for reactant and product molecules and therefore are useful in the photocatalytic process 32. To identify the chemical state of silver and nitrogen elements in Ag-N/TiO 2 sample, XPS spectroscopy was performed and results are shown in Fig. 4. The XPS core level spectrum of Ti2p, where the Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 peaks corresponds to binding energies of 459.2 eV and 464.8 eV respectively of Ti 4 in the TiO 2 lattice 34,35.O1s level displays the peak at 530 eV due to oxygen bonding in TiO 2 and the second smaller peak at 531.9 eV can be attributed to adsorbed O 2 in the prepared Ag-N/TiO 2 sample 36.N1s core level spectrum displays two peaks centered at 400 eV and 396 eV.The first peak is due to interstitial occupation of N and oxidized N species (NO) to form Ti-O-N and Ti-O-N-O bonds 37.Interestingly the second peak at 396 eV has previously been attributed to Ti-N and Ti-N-O and is consistent with TiO 2-x N x 37,38.In Ag 3d spectrum, the peaks of Ag 3d5/2 and Ag3d3/2 of Ag species are centered at 368.6 and 374.5 eV respectively, suggesting that Ag species in the Ag-TiO 2-x N x sample is in the metallic state 39. The absorption spectra of pure TiO 2 , N/TiO 2 , Ag-N/TiO 2 and Cu-N/TiO 2 have been shown in Fig. 5A.Compared to pure TiO 2 , all other samples showed a clear red shift towards higher wavelength range of 400-650 nm.Moreover, the comparative data suggest that copper additive on N/TiO 2 has highest absorption in visible light region.The spectral data of Fig. 5A was used to calculate the band-gap energy (E g ) of the samples by the following equation: (h) 1/2 A (h-E g ) for allowed indirect transitions, where A and h are absorption coefficient and photon energy respectively 40.The plot of (h) 1/2 versus h (eV) and then intercept of the tangent lines against the photon energy was used to calculate the band gap energy (Fig. 5B).The estimated band gap energies for the photocatalysts are 3.2 eV, 2.9 eV, 2.0 eV and 1.3 eV for TiO 2 , N/TiO 2 , Ag-N/TiO 2 and Cu-N/TiO 2 respectively.The decrease in the band gap energy of N/TiO 2 can be attributed to the mixing of N2p states with O2p states on the top of valence band or creates an N-induced mid-gap level due to substitutional doping of nitrogen 41.Furthermore, the addition of Ag or Cu has also decreased the band gap energy of N/TiO 2 .The maximum decrease in the band gap energy upto 1.3 eV was observed for Cu-N/TiO 2 sample.This significant reduction in band gap energy due to cooperative effect of metal and nonmetal can be attributed to the formation of mixed energy levels between the valence band and conduction band of TiO 2 , thus enhanced visible light absorption of the catalyst. In this study, the photocatalytic performance of metal ions (Cu and Ag) loaded and nitrogen doped TiO 2 nanoparticles for the photoreduction of CO 2 under visible light irradiation (420 nm) was investigated and results are shown in Fig. 6A.During the photocatalysis reaction, the methane was the only hydrocarbon product detected in the gas phase over all the prepared photocatalysts under these conditions.Moreover, the results demonstrate that concentration of methane increased almost linearly with visible light irradiation time of 6 h for all samples.As shown in Fig. 6B, the photocatalytic performance of pure TiO 2 sample was very poor for methane formation (2.8 mol h -1 g cat. -1 ), however, nitrogen doped TiO 2 sample showed enhanced activity (8 mol h -1 g cat. -1 ).Furthermore, the incorporation of metal ions of Cu or Ag along with nitrogen into TiO 2 lattice has also excellent influence on photoreduction of CO 2 under visible light irradiation. The photocatalytic performance of all samples for CO 2 conversion follows the order: Ag-N/TiO 2 (15 mol h -1 g cat. -1 ) Cu-N/TiO 2 (12 mol h -1 g cat. -1 ).The Ag loaded and nitrogen doped sample is the most active, over which the evolved methane is 15 mol h -1 g cat. -1 after one hour irradiation under visible light.The excellent performance of Ag-N/TiO 2 nanophotocatalyst compared to other samples can be attributed to enhanced visible light absorption, reduced recombination of photoexcited charge carriers, higher surface area due to silver and nitrogen doping. The photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 into methane over Ag-N/ TiO 2 sample was repeated for three times, and the results are shown in Fig. 7.In each cycle the initial methane evolution rate could be restored and there was no obvious change observed in methane production.The present study results show that the Ag-N/TiO 2 photocatalyst was stable under the present experimental conditions even after 6 h irradiation time. In the general reaction mechanism for CO 2 photoreduction over the photocatalyst, it can be proposed that the photocatalyst was excited by light irradiation to generate electrons (at the conduction band) and holes (at the valence band).The produced holes reacted with the adsorbed H 2 O molecules to form H ions, the H ions then reacted with electrons to form H radicals.After this, CO 2 was reduced by H radicals to produce methane 6,33,42.The excellent performance of the prepared photocatalyst (Ag-N/TiO 2 ) can be explained by the following mechanism (shown in Scheme 1).The doped nitrogen into TiO 2 lattice created a new N2p state slightly above the valence band top which consists of O2p state.Therefore, the electrons were excited from the highest occupied N2p state to the conduction under visible light irradiation.Secondly, the separation and transportation of photocreated electrons and holes is crucial for photocatalytic activity.The silver particles in the co-doped sample acted as electron-hole separation centres due to deposition onto the surface of TiO 2 .It can be ascribed to the reason that radius of Ag ions (126 pm) is much larger than that of Ti 4 (68 pm) and so the Ag ions introduced by the sol-gel process would not enter into the lattice of anatase phase of TiO 2 43.However, during the calcination process, these uniformly dispersed Ag ions would gradually transfer from the volume of the TiO 2 to the surface by increasing their crystallinity, resulting in silver deposition on the surface on heat treatment at 450 C 43.The deposition of silver particles on TiO 2 surface forms a Schottky barrier at Ag-TiO 2 contact surface, because the Fermi level of TiO 2 is higher than that of silver metal 44.Therefore, the transfer of electrons from the conduction band of TiO 2 to metallic silver particles is possible, which played its major role to enhance the photocatalytic activity of Ag-N/ TiO 2 under visible light irradiation.In addition, the residual silver ions present within the material, acting as efficient electron traps to enhance the photocatalytic performance. In this investigation, only methane gas was detected from CO 2 photoconversion.It is known that the distribution of products from CO 2 conversion strongly depends on the reaction system and catalyst surface properties.There were different hydrocarbon products detected over TiO 2 photocatalyst in different reports 454647.Moreover, the production of hydrocarbons from CO 2 photoconversion is closely related to the band structure of the photocatalyst and the reductionoxidation potentials of the products 33.The reduction potentials of probable hydrocarbon products are: CO 2 /COOH-0.43V, CO 2 / CH 3 OH-0.32V, CO 2 /CH 4 -0.24V, while conduction band potential of TiO 2 is -0.5 V 48.This comparison shows that the reduction potential for the formation of methane from CO 2 is lower than that required for other hydrocarbon formation.Therefore, CO 2 might be preferably reduced to methane over the prepared photocatalysts in this study."
