    "content": "Ce doped TiO 2 anatase/brookite composites with 0.6-5.5 wt of Ce, as well as parent TiO 2 anatase/ brookite were synthesized to be investigated in two environmentally-beneficial reactions, the photocatalytic decomposition of N 2 O and the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .Composites were prepared unconventionally, by using sol-gel method combined with the processing by pressurized hot fluids (in the sequence water/methanol/water).The physicochemical and electronic properties of all synthesized composites were characterized by organic elementary analysis, nitrogen physisorption, powder X-ray diffraction, Xray fluorescence spectroscopy, diffuse reflectance UV-vis spectroscopy and work function measurements.It was revealed that all composites show comparable textural properties, crystallite size, as well as optical properties, except for the 5.5 wt Ce/TiO 2 composite which showed significantly lowered band gap energy due to the significantly higher population of Ce.Concerning the composite structural properties, the addition of different amounts of Ce in the range of 0.6-5.5 wt affected markedly the phase composition of composites, namely the anatase-to-brokite weight ratio.Concerning the photocatalytic tests the 5.5 wt Ce/TiO 2 composite showed the highest photocatalytic performance.The highest photocatalytic performance of the 5.5 wt Ce/TiO 2 composite can be attributed to the lowest composite work function which is affected by both the amount of Ce, as well as the phase composition."

    "content": "2.1 Preparation of Ce/TiO 2 and parent TiO 2 Ce/TiO 2 with various low cerium loadings (0.6-5.5 wt of Ce) and parent TiO 2 examined in this study were prepared by using sol-gel process and processing by pressurized hot fluids.Sol-gel process was controlled in reverse micelles environment of nonionic surfactant Triton X-114 in cyclohexane.Processing by pressurized hot fluids (namely water and methanol) was used as an unconventional alternative to common thermal treatment. Chemicals for sol-gel synthesis: cyclohexane (HPLC grade), absolute ethanol (water content max.0.2 vol.), non-ionic surfactant Triton X-114 ((1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl)phenyl-polyethylene glycol, C 29 H 52 O 8.5 , Aldrich), titanium (IV) isopropoxide (99.999,Aldrich), cerium (III) nitrate hexahydrate (Aldrich), and distilled water. Chemicals for high-pressure processing: deionized water (electrical conductivity 0.08-0.12S cm -1 ) and methanol (HPLC grade). Cerium doped TiO 2 gels for high-pressure processing were synthesized via sol-gel process controlled in reverse micelles of nonionic surfactant Triton X-114 in cyclohexane.Cerium doped titania sols, resulting in gels after a gelation period, were prepared as follows.The cerium (III)containing sol was prepared in the first step: the appropriate amount of cerium (III) nitrate hexahydrate was dissolved in absolute ethanol (3 mL) under intense stirring.In the next step cyclohexane was mixed with Triton X-114 and distilled water followed by the addition of ceria sol.The sol was stirred for 20 min.In the final step titanium (IV) isopropoxide was injected into the mixture.The cerium doped titania micellar sol was stirred for next 20 min.Then the homogeneous yellow transparent sol was poured into Petri's dishes in a thin layer (4 mm) and the dishes were left standing on air for gelation for 48 h.In general, the cerium doped titania sols were prepared keeping the molar ratio of cyclohexane: Triton X-114: H 2 O: Ti(OCH(CH 3 ) 2 ) 4 Ce (NO 3 ) 3 6H 2 O at 11: 1: 1: 1 21,22.After the gelation period, the gels were ground to small pieces (2 2 mm) and processed by using pressurized hot water/methanol/ water in order to produce nanostructured Ce/TiO 2 in powder form.The TiO 2 sol was also prepared by the same preparation procedure, excluding the first step.For TiO 2 synthesis, the molar ratio of cyclohexane: Triton X-114: H 2 O: Ti(OCH(CH 3 ) 2 ) 4 was also kept at 11: 1: 1: 1 23. High-pressure processing by pressurized hot (subcritical) fluids was performed in a laboratory-developed set-up equipped with the HPLC BETA10 Plus gradient pump (Ecom s.r.o., Czech Republic), the chromatographic oven operating in the temperature range 25-400 C, the capillary cooling and the restrictor operating at ambient temperature.The illustration of the experimental set-up is shown in 9,20.The gel placed in 24 ml high-temperature stainless steel cell was processed in a flow regime at pressure of 10 MPa and temperature of 225 C, using the sequence of solvents 1.5 l of deionized water, 0.25 l of methanol and subsequently again 0.1 l of deionized water.This sequence of solvents was applied to avoid the presence of elementary carbon on the surface of Ce/TiO 2 and TiO 2 from not-ideally expanded methanol.The solvents flow rate during the highpressure processing was kept 3.5-4.50ml/min.Prepared Ce/TiO 2 and TiO 2 powders were sieved to particle-size fraction 0.160 mm.This particle-size fraction was used for the characterization, as well as the photocatalytic tests. Organic elementary analysis (OEA), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), nitrogen physisorption at 77 K, powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), DRS UV-vis measurements and work function measurements were carried out in order to determine the purity, chemical composition, porous morphology, phase composition, microstructural, optical, and electronic properties of prepared materials. The purity (elementary C and H in wt) of materials was determined on the Vario EL III apparatus from Elementar.Approximately 5 mg of solid material was burned in oxygen atmosphere at temperature up to 1200 C.Gaseous products (N 2 , CO 2 , H 2 O, and SO 2 ) were purified, separated to individual components and analysed on TCD detector.Analyses were duplicated.The detection limit of the apparatus was 0.1 abs. X-ray fluorescence was performed on the ARL 9400 XP sequential WD-XRF spectrometer.The spectrometer was equipped with Rh anode end-window X-ray tube type 4GN fitted with 75 mm Be window.All peak intensity data were collected under vacuum conditions using the software WinXRF.The generator settings-collimator-crystal-detector combinations were optimized for all 79 measured elements with analysis time of 6 s per element.The obtained data were evaluated by standard-less software Uniquant 4. The analysed powders were pressed into pellets about 0.5 mm thick and the diameter of 25 mm with boric acid. Nitrogen physisorption at 77 K was performed on the NOVA2000e automated volumetric apparatus (Quantachrome Instruments, USA) after the degassing of materials at 105 C for 12 h under vacuum below 1 Torr.Degassing at temperature of 105 C before nitrogen physisorption measurement was applied to remove physisorbed water.The specific surface area, S BET , was calculated according to the classical Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) theory for the p/p 0 range of 0.05-0.3024.As the specific surface area, S BET , is not a proper parameter in the case of mesoporous solids containing micropores 25, the mesopore surface area, S meso , and the micropore volume, V micro , were also evaluated based on the t-plot method 26 with the C modif constant 27,28.The net pore volume, V net , was determined from the nitrogen adsorption isotherm at maximum p/p 0 (0.994).The pore-size distribution was evaluated from the adsorption branch of the nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm by the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda method 28 using the de Boer standard isotherm and assuming cylindrical pore geometry 29. X-ray powder diffraction patterns were measured using a Panalytical X'Pert MPD Pro diffractometer.XRD measurements were performed in the conventional focusing Bragg-Brentano geometry, using Ni-filtered Cu K radiation and a position-sensitive PiXCel detector collecting the scattered intensity in the diffraction angle (2) range of 15-140with a step of 0.013 deg.Automatic divergence slits were used in both the primary and diffracted beam to keep the irradiated area constant during the 20 h measurement.LaB6 standard reference material (660a) was used for instrumental broadening calibration.XRD data analysis focused on determination of phase composition, crystallite size, crystallite size distribution, microstrain and anatase Tioccupancy and O-occupancy was done using Rietveld/ WPPM 30 implemented in the MSTRUCT software 31,32.Models described in 11 were used. UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of as-prepared photocatalysts were measured in quartz cuvettes by using a GBS CINTRA 303 spectrometer (GBC Scientific Equipment, Australia).The spectra were scanned at a wavelength of 200-900 nm at a scanning rate of 100 nm.min -1 , a scanning step of 1 nm, and a 2 nm monochromator slot width.The reflectance was recalculated into the absorption by using of Kubelka-Munk equation where R is the diffuse reflectance from a semi-infinite layer.The obtained spectra were transformed to the dependencies (F(R )h) 2 against h in order to obtain the values of the energy of absorption edge. Kelvin method with KP6500 probe (McAllister Technical Services) was used for measuring the contact potential difference.Stainless steel plate with diameter of 3 mm and work function 4.1 eV was used as reference electrode.Measurement conditions were set to 0.2 for the gradient of peak-to-peak versus backing potential, 120 Hz for vibration frequency and 40 a.u.for amplitude.The work function of measured photocatalyst was calculated from simple equation V CPD ref - sample where ref is the work function of reference electrode, V CPD is measured contact potential difference which is obtained as an average of 40 independent points and sample is the calculated work function of characterized photocatalysts.All the samples were measured at ambient temperature and pressure in order to simulate the conditions at the photocatalytic reaction itself as close as possible.All the samples were pelletized into pellets of 10mm under the pressure of 8 MPa. GC/IRMS DELTA Advantage (Thermo Scientific, America) was used for the detection of 13C in gas samples before and after photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 . The N 2 O photocatalytic decomposition was carried out in a hand-crafted apparatus at ambient temperature.The antiadhesive material with 0.1 g of material was put on the bottom of the reactor.The metal flange with flat quartz visors was placed on the batch reactor with circulation mixing in the form of a bypass with peristaltic pump (volume of 182 ml).The circulation rate was set to be 200 r.p.m.The reactor was filled with 968 p.p.m.N 2 O/He mixture and illuminated linearly using an 8 W Hg lamp with a peak light intensity at 254 nm.During the reaction the pressure and the temperature inside the reactor were monitored.Gas chromatograph with a thermal conductivity detector (GC/ TCD) equipped with the Molsieve and HP Poraplot Q columns were used for the analysis of N 2 O.The N 2 O concentration was measured before switching on the UV lamp and during the irradiation.The reproducibility of photocatalytic experiments was verified by repeated tests in the interval of 0-18 h. The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 was performed in a home-made stirred batch reactor with suspended photocatalyst in aqueous solution of NaOH (0.2 mol/L).8 W Hglamp with peak intensity at 254 nm was used as a source of UV irradiation and was placed on top of flat cover with quartz glass window.Before the reaction itself the suspension was saturated by pure CO 2 gas (99.998 purity) through sintered glass to eliminate the CO 2 diffusion from the gas phase through the gas-liquid interface.During the saturation of the suspension the pH dropped from 11.8 to 6.6.Optimal concentration 1 g of photogatalyst/l was chosen to avoid concentration gradients in the bulk of stirred suspension with the dispersion due to a scattering effect of light as a result of the high nanocomposite concentration 33.To ensure ideal mixing, 120 ml of sodium hydroxide was chosen 34.Gas phase products were discontinuously taken and immediately analysed on gas chromatograph (Agilent 5890) equipped by TCD and FID and ShinCarbon ST micropacked column.Before the experiment itself a series of blank tests were carried out to ensure all the products are coming from the photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide.At first a test without irradiation was done, then without photocatalyst and the last one was without CO 2 .All blank tests were negative therefore it can be safely said all the products are generated from the photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide.To confirm the methane is really a product of photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide a measurement with CO 2 containing 13C isotope was conducted.Analyses were performed by GC / IRMS instrument to DELTA Advantage (Thermo Scientific, USA). Information about UV irradiation: Based on our previous experiments 35 it was found that significantly higher yields of CO 2 reduction was achieved using a UVC irradiation ( 254 nm) than the UVA irradiation ( 365 nm).It was due to the generation rate of electron-hole increased with increasing energy of irradiation (decreasing wavelength) and thereby increased the efficiency of the photocatalyst.For the above reasons and with respect to the band gaps of the catalysts, being both photocatalytic experiments used a lamp with a wavelength of 254 nm."

    "content": "The exact chemical composition (namely the Ce contents in individual composites) determined by XRF is shown in Table 1. The increasing amount of Ce within the range of 0.6-5.5 wt of Ce in TiO 2 has only negligible effect on the surface area and the micropore volume of Ce/TiO 2 composites, which is evident from evaluated textural properties summarized in Table 1.The measured nitrogen adsorptiondesorption isotherms and evaluated pore-size distributions of investigated Ce/TiO 2 composites are shown in Fig. 1a,b.As it is obvious from Fig. 1a, b, all composites are mesoporous solids with minor contribution of micropores.The micropores contribute 8-10 of net pore volume of each composite and the mesopore surface area of Ce/TiO 2 composites ranges between 87 and 98 m 2 /g (see Table 1).The tiny differences in textural properties correspond to minor differences within microstructural properties determined from XRD refinement using MStruct software summarized in Table 2. XRD patterns of investigated Ce/TiO 2 composites revealing their similar crystal structure are shown in Fig. 2. All Ce/TiO 2 composites are the mixtures of major anatase (JCPDS Card No. 00-021-1272) and minor brookite (JCPDS Card No. 00-029-1360) phase; the minimum amount of 6 wt of brookite was in 1.4 wt Ce/TiO 2 .The 0.6 and 0.9 wt Ce/TiO 2 composites possess anatase and brookite crystallites of 12 and 4-5 nm size, respectively, which are larger differences than for 1.4 and 5.5 wt Ce/TiO 2 composites where anatase and brookite crystallites have 11 nm and 6-7 nm sizes, respectively.The highest microstrain in anatase crystallites showed 0.9 wt and 5.5 wt Ce/TiO 2 nanocomposites.The lowest anatase Tioccupancy showed 1.4 wt Ce/TiO 2 composite. The absorption edge energy (E bg ) is one of the important optical properties of composites and the idea is to lower it enough, so the composite can absorb photons of visible light.Cerium as a dopant was chosen due to its effect on the band gap energy, which should be lowered by already very low amount of Ce 19,36.In contrast to that, the significant decrease of band gap energy was observed after addition of relatively large amount of Ce (5.5 wt), but low amounts of Ce (up to 1.4 wt) did not affect the band gap energy so markedly (Table 1, Fig. 3).This feature can be attributed to the changing phase composition of anatase/ brookite mixture (Table 2) and the different band gap energies of individual crystal phases (3.2 eV for anatase and 3.3 eV for brookite 37).In the range of 0.6-1.4wt of Ce in TiO 2 , the content of anatase increased compared to pure TiO 2 that participated in the decrease of band gap energy besides the cerium content.In the case of 5.5 wt Ce/TiO 2 mainly the increasing population of Ce contributed to the decrease of the band gap energy. The effect of irradiation time on the photochemical and photocatalytic decomposition of N 2 O was investigated for all prepared composites within the time period of 0-18 h.The time dependences of N 2 O conversion for all tested composites and photolysis are shown in Fig. 4. The progressive increase of N 2 O conversion with increasing irradiation time was achieved.The highest N 2 O conversion of 85 was observed over 5.5 wt Ce/TiO 2 after 18 h irradiation. The mechanism of N 2 O photocatalytic decomposition is proposed in literature 24,38.During UV illumination with a sufficient photonic energy (h), the generated electrons (e -) and holes (h ) are created on the photocatalyst surface (R1).The electrons react with N 2 O adsorbed on the photocatalyst surface forming N 2 and O -radicals (R2).Incipient O -radicals can react with holes (R3) or with another molecule of N 2 O to produce O 2 (R4). From Table 1 and Table 2 it is evident that all Ce/TiO 2 composites as well as pure TiO 2 show very similar textural properties (i.e., mesopore surface area, microporosity, pore volume) as well as the microstructure (i.e., anatase and brookite crystallite size, microstrain, anatase Ti-occupancy and O-occupancy).Thus, the effect of textural and microstructural properties on the photocatalytic activity of Ce/ TiO 2 composites may be excluded.On the other hand, it is clear that the amount of added Ce in TiO 2 influences the phase composition of Ce/TiO 2 composites (i.e., anatase-tobrookite weight ratio, Table 2) and this property can affect the photocatalytic activity of Ce/TiO 2 composites via its effect on the composite work function.Concerning the band gap energy, that of Ce/TiO 2 composites are similar to TiO 2 with the exception of 5.5 wt Ce/TiO 2 which possesses the lowest band gap energy of 3.02 eV (Table 1).This feature may also positively affect the photoactivity of 5.5 wt Ce/ TiO 2 . In Fig. 5 the correlation between the amount of added Ce in TiO 2 , the work function and the N 2 O conversion is shown.The work function is defined as the minimum energy needed to remove an electron from the surface of the solid 39.The work function of investigated Ce/TiO 2 composites decreases with increasing amount of Ce and the lowest measured work function corresponds to the highest N 2 O conversion.As it is evident there exists a correlation between the work function and the N 2 O conversion, being affected by the amount of added Ce which influences crucially the phase composition, as well as the band gap energy of Ce/TiO 2 composite, when pressurized fluid processing is applied for preparation.The observed determining role of Ce amount and type of preparation, influencing the anatase- The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 was investigated over a period 0-20 h of irradiation.Methane and hydrogen, coming from the water splitting, were observed as the only two detected products of the reaction in the gas phase.There are also papers where methanol and formic acid 41,42 were the main products in the liquid phase, but in our experimental setup other products were not detected.For experiment with CO 2 containing 13C isotope samples were taken at various times and the increase of 13C amount in methane was observed with increasing irradiation time.These measurements confirmed that the methane is a product of CO 2 photocatalytic reduction. The yields of methane and hydrogen (in mol/g cat. ) are shown in Fig. 6a,b.In all cases, the products generation rate was linear at the beginning of the reaction up to approximately 8 h.After longer time of irradiation, the products generation rate decreased.Methane was the main product of the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .The highest yields of methane were obtained in the presence of three composites; parent TiO 2 , 1.4 wt Ce/TiO 2 and 5.5 wt Ce/TiO 2 .The highest yields of hydrogen were obtained in the presence of 1.4 wt Ce/TiO 2 and 5.5 wt Ce/TiO 2 .The 0.6 wt Ce/ TiO 2 and 0.9 wt Ce/TiO 2 composites proved significantly lower photocatalytic activity in both methane and hydrogen yields. The formation of generated electrons (e -) and holes (h ) on the photocatalyst surface illuminated by UV light with a sufficient photonic energy (h) (R1) is the first step common for nominated mechanism of CO 2 photocatalytic reduction.The holes react with the water adsorbed on the photocatalyst, resulting in the production of hydroxyl radicals (OH) and hydrogen ions (H ) according to (R5).The water is further oxidized by OH, creating oxygen and H (R6).The reaction of H ions with the excited electrons leads to the formation of H radicals (R7) which are necessary for the CO 2 reduction.Simultaneously, CO 2 -radicals are formed from CO 2 (R8).These nascent It is well known that one of the most important material properties for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 are the band gap edge, the positions of conductive and valence bands, and the redox potentials of individual reactants 43.In our previous work the correlation between semiconductor's work function and its photocatalytic activity was reported 19,44, where the nanocomposites with the lowest work function showed the highest photoactivity.But those composites were simpler materials (ZnS/MMT and Ce/TiO 2 anatase).In the case of anatase/brookite mixture modified by Ce, there are more interfaces compared to only one in the case of Ce/anatase.The first interphase is between anatase and brookite, where the anatase has the band gap potential around 3.2 eV and brookite around 3.3 eV 37.Since both crystal phases are semiconductors and photons do not choose what they irradiate, the electrons and holes are generated in both phases.Due to the differences between conduction band potentials, the electrons are transported from brookite (lower potential, around-0.46V) to anatase (higher potential, around-0.45V) and therefore the recombination of charge carriers in brookite is slowed down 45. The addition of Ce makes the case more complex.Since the electron affinity of Ce is much lower than the one of titania, there is no generation of Schottky barrier on the interphase between TiO 2 and Ce.This means that the electrons from Ce will transport to TiO 2 and both processes, oxidation, and reduction, are happening on the surface of anatase or brookite, respectively.The suggested scheme of expected electron transfer is shown in Fig. 7. The correlation between the work function, methane yields and the added Ce amount in weight percentages is depicted in Fig. 8.A resembling relationship of the photocatalytic activity with the work function as for the N 2 O conversion in the N 2 O photocatalytic decomposition was also observed for the methane yields in the CO 2 photocatalytic reduction.The methane yields for the Ce/TiO 2 composites are increasing with decreasing work function.The only exception is 5.5 wt Ce/TiO 2 which possesses lower work function than all the composites with lower Ce loading (Fig. 8), but the methane yield is lower than of 1.4 wt Ce/TiO 2 .This could be simply explained by the band gap energy.In contrast to 1.4 wt Ce/TiO 2 , 5.5 wt Ce/TiO 2 has significantly lower band gap energy (Table 1), that could lead to the decrease of the position of conduction band, and as a consequence the conduction band edge of the 5.5 wt Ce/TiO 2 composite is lower than the reduction potential of H . Even though parent TiO 2 has the highest work function, which means its ability to release electron from the Fermi level is the lowest one from all investigated composites, the Fig. 6 The time dependence of a methane and b hydrogen yields over investigated TiO 2 and Ce/TiO 2 composites photocatalytic activity of parent TiO 2 was quite high.The addition of Ce leads to more willing relaxation of electrons from the surface of composite, but the photocatalytic activity is dropping as well.This is most likely caused by the transport of electrons from Ce to TiO 2 .Therefore, there is higher recombination possibility for holes."

    "content": "A series of Ce modified anatase/brookite composites were prepared by unconventional method where typical thermal treatment was substituted by processing by pressurized hot water and methanol.Ce/TiO 2 composites with various Ce amounts and ratios of anatase-to-brookite were investigated for the photocatalytic decomposition of N 2 O and the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .Addition of Ce to anatase/ brookite mixture resulted in lowered band gap energy, but contrary to Ce/anatase composites, the situation was more complex.While at lower Ce contents (up to 1.4 wt) the changing content of anatase in anatase/brookite mixture was responsible for negligible lowering of band gap energy, at high Ce content (5.5 wt) significantly lowered band gap energy can be attributed to increased population of Ce in composite.Concerning the photocatalytic performance of developed composites, the 5.5 wt Ce/TiO 2 composite may be considered as the most active one.The highest photocatalytic activity of the 5.5 wt Ce/TiO 2 composite can be explained by the lowest work function which was affected by the amount of Ce in TiO 2 , as well as the phase composition.
