    "content": "The used precursors were CaCO 3 (Kojundo, 99.99), SrCO 3 (Wako, 95), BaCO 3 (Wako, 98), ZrO 2 (Wako, 98), and TiO 2 (rutile; Kojundo, 99.99).The alkaline-earth zirconate and titanate samples were prepared by a solid-state reaction method according to literature 40.An alkaline-earth carbonate and ZrO 2 were mixed with the molar ratio of 1:1 in a mortar for 20 min while wetting with acetone.This wet mixing was repeated 3 times.The mixture was dried in an electric oven at 353 K overnight.It was put into an aluminum crucible, heated in an electric muffle furnace at a rate of 180 K h -1 up to 1473 K for CaZrO 3 or 1373 K for SrZrO 3 and BaZrO 3 , and held at this temperature for 24 h, followed by naturally cooling down in the furnace to room temperature.These CaZrO 3 , SrZrO 3 , and BaZrO 3 samples are referred to as CZO, SZO, and BZO.For titanates, the starting materials were similarly mixed using ethanol for 40 min 2 times and dried at 353 K overnight.The mixture in an aluminum crucible was once calcined at 1173 K for 6 h, ground, and calcined again at 1373 K for 12 h.The obtained CaTiO 3 , SrTiO 3 and BaTiO 3 samples are referred to as CTO, STO, and BTO. The Ag cocatalyst was loaded on the surface of the zirconate and titanate samples by a photodeposition method.The photocatalyst powder (1.7 g), a required amount of AgNO 3 , and an aqueous solution of NaHCO 3 (1.0M, 1500 mL) were put into a quartz inner-irradiationtype reactor.Then the suspension was magnetically stirred for 1 h with a bubbling flow of Ar gas to remove air, photoirradiated from a 400 W high-pressure Hg lamp for 2 h, filtered with suction, and dried in the oven at 353 K.The obtained sample were referred to as Ag(x)/photocatalyst, such as Ag(3)/CZO, where x was loading amount of Ag in weight calculated from the amount of the start materials. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) of the sample was measured with a Shimadzu Lab X XRD-6000.Diffuse reflectance (DR) UV-visible spectrum was recorded by a JASCO V-670.The morphology of the sample was observed by a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with a JEOL JSM-890, from which the average particle size was determined.The amount of nitrogen adsorption at 77 K was measured by a Monosorb (Quantachrome) to calculate the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface area.The Ag loading amount on the CZO and BZO samples were determined by X-ray florescence analysis with an EDX-8000 (Shimadzu), where the calibration curve was experimentally obtained from the samples prepared by the impregnation method. The photocatalytic reaction test was carried out in the inner-irradiation-type reactor with a 400 W high-pressure Hg lamp by using 0.5 g of the photocatalyst sample in an aqueous solution of NaHCO 3 (1.0M, 1500 mL).After the air was purged by a bubbling flow of CO 2 at a flow rate of 35 mL min -1 for 3 h in the dark, the photocatalytic reaction test was started upon photoirradiation with a CO 2 bubbling flow of 30 mL min -1 .The amounts of the products in the outlet gas mixture were determined by a gas chromatograph (Shimadzu, GC-8A, TCD, Shincarbon ST column, Ar carrier).The possible products in the liquid phase were not analyzed since the very large volume of water should dilute them. Since the detected gaseous products were limited to CO, H 2 , and O 2 , the CO selectivity was defined as eq.4, and the ratio of the consumed electrons and holes, R(e -/h ), was calculated as eq. 5. R(e -/h ) (electrons consumed for H 2 and CO formation) / (holes consumed for O 2 formation) The addition of NaHCO 3 is required to dissolve CO 2 into the solution and it is confirmed that the CO molecules is produced from not the HCO 3 -anion but the dissolved CO 2 in these photocatalytic systems for CO 2 reduction by water with CO 2 bubbling by using heterogeneous Agloaded semiconductor photocatalyst 41,42."

    "content": "Fig. 1 shows XRD patterns of the prepared alkaline-earth zirconate samples and their references from a database.The CZO sample showed a clear pattern assignable to CaZrO 3 perovskite and a very small diffraction due to unreacted ZrO 2 at 30.1 as a tiny amount of impurity phase (Fig. 1a).The XRD patterns of the SZO and BZO samples can be assigned to those of SrZrO 3 and BaZrO 3 perovskites and no diffraction line originated from the impurity phase was observed, determining that these samples consisted of the pure phase crystallites.And, Fig. S1 shows XRD patterns of the prepared alkaline-earth titanite samples, which agreed with that of each reference, indicating the pure ATiO 3 perovskite samples were correctly obtained. Fig. 2 shows DR UV-visible spectra of the prepared alkaline-earth zirconate and titanate samples.The CZO, SZO, and BZO samples showed the absorption edge at 220, 230 and 250 nm, respectively (Fig. 2a-c), from which the bandgaps were estimated to be 5.8, 5.6, and 5.2 eV, respectively (Table 1).These absorption edges are much shorter in wavelength than those of alkaline-earth titanate samples, i.e., 350, 380, and 400 nm for the CTO, STO, and BTO samples, respectively (Fig. 2d-f), which correspond to the bandgaps of 3.6, 3.3, and 3.2 eV, respectively.Assuming that these alkaline-earth zirconates and zirconium oxide have the same potential at the valence band maximum 43,44, the potentials at the bottom of the conduction band for these zirconates (CZO, SZO, and BZO) were calculated from their bandgaps to be -1.8,-1.6, and -1.2 V, respectively, which are much more negative than the redox potentials of H /H 2 and CO 2 /CO, meaning that these materials can thermodynamically promote both photocatalytic CO 2 reduction and water splitting.Further, the integral photoabsorption intensity for each sample was apparently much different from each other, and the alkaline-earth zirconate samples showed much lower integral photoabsorption intensity than alkaline-earth titanate samples.In general, the large band gaps and smaller photoabsorption of the alkaline-earth zirconate samples would be unfortunately considered as fundamental disadvantages for the efficient solar light utilization. Fig. 3 shows SEM images of these samples, revealing their morphologies and particle sizes.All alkaline-earth zirconate samples consisted of roundish particles and the CZO sample showed larger particles than others.The particle size distributions of these samples were estimated from the SEM images and shown in Fig. 4. The estimated average particle size of the CZO, SZO, and BZO samples was 0.43, 0.23, and 0.18 m, respectively (Table 1).The specific surface area of the CZO, SZO, and BZO samples were 1.8, 3.2, and 5.8 m 2 g -1 , respectively (Table 1).The decreasing order of their particle sizes was consistent with the increasing order of their specific surface areas. Fig. 5 shows the time course of the production rates and the CO selectivity (S CO ) in the photocatalytic reaction test for the CO 2 reduction by water with the bare CZO sample.This sample produced both CO and H 2 , meaning that both photocatalytic CO 2 reduction and water splitting took place competitively.The production rates of CO and H 2 were almost constant from the start of photoirradiation, and 2.7 and 8.9 mol h -1 , respectively, after 3.5 h irradiation, and the reaction selectivity for the CO 2 reduction was constantly ca.24 .The production rate of O 2 was, however, very low compared to the value expected from the production rates of the reductive products, CO and H 2 , in this reaction conditions.That is, the ratio of the productively consumed electrons and holes was not unity but too high such as R(e -/h ) 20, although the value became smaller with time from 20 to 2.4 for 5 h.The possible reasons for the initial insufficient O 2 evolution have been discussed in literature 13; for example, the difficulty of O 2 evolution due to the high overpotential of O 2 formation 454647, photo-adsorption on the surface of catalyst 48,49, or formation of other oxidative products such as hydrogen peroxide 50.Moreover, dissolution of oxygen in 1500 mL of water might contribute to the insufficient O 2 evolution in the present conditions even under the CO 2 bubbling flow, since the expected O 2 formation amount in the photocatalytic reaction for 5 h was 12.7 mol and, for reference, the saturated amount of dissolved O 2 in 1500 mL water under 1 atom at 283 K is 5290 mol. On the other hand, the bare BZO sample exhibited a quite different photocatalytic performance as shown in Fig. S2.The bare BZO sample almost constantly showed high production rates for H 2 and O 2 , and low rate for CO formation, which were 286, 121, and 2.70 mol h -1 , respectively, after photoirradiation for 3.5 h.This means that it predominantly promoted photocatalytic water splitting, which is consistent with literature 29.The ratio of the consumed electron and hole, R(e -/h ), was almost unity after 3.5 hours. Fig. 6 shows the formation rates of products and the CO selectivity, S CO , in the photocatalytic reaction test with the pristine zirconate and titanate samples for comparison, which were recorded after 3.5 h from the start of photoirradiation.At a glance, the three bare zirconate samples exhibited much higher photocatalytic activities than these bare titanates in the present conditions although the zirconates can absorb more limited light than the titanates (Fig. 2). Among these three zirconate samples, the bare BZO sample had the highest photocatalytic activity for water splitting with high production rates such as 286 and 121 mol h -1 for H 2 and O 2 , respectively and the highest selectivity for water splitting.In the present study, since the employed high-pressure Hg lamp gives several bright lines in the spectrum, further detailed discussion about the reaction rates should be avoided here.However, the reaction selectivity can be discussed as follows.Among them, the bare CZO sample produced CO at 2.70 mol h -1 with the highest CO selectivity of 23, and the three samples showed the CO selectivity in the decreasing order, the bare CZO sample the bare SZO sample the bare BZO sample. As for this variation of the CO selectivity, the following possible reasons can be considered.This order was consistent with the decreasing order of the conduction band minimum, i.e., -1.8, -1.6, and -1.2 V, for CZO, SZO, and BZO, respectively as mentioned above, implying that the more negative potential the zirconate photocatalyst has, the more advantageous it is for the CO 2 reduction.However, since all these potentials are largely negative enough to reduce both CO 2 to CO and H to H 2 , it is unclear if these differences of the conduction band minimum is really the dominant reason for this order in the CO formation rate or not.Meanwhile, Ca cation at the A site in the ABO 3 perovskite structure induced the lattice distortion (orthorhombic .This lattice distortion would vary the spatial extent of the 2p orbital in the neighboring lattice oxygen, which may enhance the adsorption and activation of CO 2 .Besides, the particle size of the CZO sample was about twice larger than those of the SZO and BZO samples.In the previous report, a clear tendency among several CaTiO 3 photocatalysts was observed that the larger the CTO particles are, the higher CO formation rate they exhibit 11.Although a surface modification of the photocatalyst with CaO species is also reported to promote the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction 51, no such species was observed on the present CZO sample in the XRD pattern shown in Fig. 1.Thus, the crystal distortion or the larger size of the CZO crystals would be possible reasons for the high selectivity of the CO 2 reduction.On the other hand, the three alkaline-earth titanate samples exhibited almost similar but slightly different CO selectivity (S CO ) in the following order: the bare BTO sample the bare CTO sample the bare STO sample (Fig. 6).The variations in the CO formation rate and the CO selectivity for these bare titanate samples were relatively small when compared with the clear difference observed among the bare zirconate samples.Fig. 7 shows the formation rate of products and the CO selectivity in the photocatalytic reaction test with the Ag-loaded zirconate and titanate samples.The photocatalytic activity of each Ag-loaded zirconate sample was lower than that of the bare zirconate sample, while the Agloaded titanate samples showed higher CO production rate than the bare samples.In other words, although the addition of Ag species on titanate photocatalysts increased the photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction, the opposite results were obtained for the zirconate photocatalysts.Among these Ag-loaded zirconate samples, the Ag(3)/CZO sample showed the highest CO selectivity of 41 because the production of H 2 was much suppressed, while the Ag(3)/BZO sample exhibited still the lowest CO selectivity.These three samples showed the CO selectivity in the following order, the Ag(3)/CZO sample the Ag(3)/ SZO sample the Ag(3)/BZO sample, which was the same order among the bare zirconate samples mentioned above.On the other hand, among the Ag-loaded titanate samples, the Ag(3)/CTO sample exhibited the highest CO production rate with the highest CO selectivity such as 80 in the present conditions, which was consistent with the literatures 12.And these Ag-loaded titanate samples showed the CO selectivity in the decreasing order, the Ag(3)/CTO sample the Ag (3)/STO sample the Ag(3)/BTO sample.The order of these Agloaded titanate samples are consistent with the order of the bare and Ag-loaded zirconate samples. From these results, calcium ion providing orthorhombic perovskite structure of CaZrO 3 and CaTiO 3 might be one of the important factors for the high photocatalytic performance in the CO 2 reduction by water.In other words, the distorted T-O-T angle in the orthorhombic perovskite structure may contribute to the adsorption and activation of CO 2 molecules. Fig. 8 shows the production rate in the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 over the various Ag-loaded CZO samples with different loading amount of Ag additives.The bare CZO sample produced CO and H 2 at 2.7 and 8.9 mol h -1 , respectively, as mentioned above.The addition of small amount of Ag species such as 0.9 wt much decreased the H 2 production rate less than a half, and very slightly reduced the CO production rate.However, the sample loaded with 3.3 wt of Ag species exhibited the maximum value of the CO production rate (2.7 mol h -1 ) among the Ag-loaded CZO samples and the local maximum value for the H 2 formation (3.1 mol h -1 ).Further increase of the Ag loading such as 4.0 wt lowered the production rates of both CO and H 2 , where the formation of H 2 was much suppressed.The CO selectivity increased with increasing the Ag loading amount to reach the maximum at 4.0 wt of Ag loading.For the sample loaded with 6.8 wt of Ag species, discussion of the selectivity would be not suitable due to the very slow production rates.Anyway, the Ag species of around 4 wt would be the most available for the selective CO 2 reduction.These results suggest that the role of the loaded Ag species can be divided into at least two depending on the loading amount, i.e., the Ag species diminished the photocatalytic active sites on the CaZrO 3 crystal surface, while the Ag species provided by the moderate loading amount improved the photocatalytic activity especially for CO 2 reduction to produce CO as a cocatalyst. As mentioned, the bare CaZrO 3 photocatalyst shows the photocatalytic activity.The photoexcited electrons generated in the bulk can reach to the surface through the conduction band originating from 4dorbitals of Zr atoms, and would react with protons and CO 2 molecules at the surface Zr sites (eq. 1 and 2).The photogenerated holes can migrate through the balance band originating from 2p-orbitals of oxygen atoms, reacted to the surface oxygen anion sites, and react with water to produce oxygen and protons (eq.3).It is fact that the small amount of Ag species deposited on this CaZrO 3 did not function as a cocatalyst but decreased the photocatalytic activity.The amount of the Ag species would not be enough to form Ag nanoparticles of moderate size.It is suggested that most of these Ag species are present as positively charged Ag cations or small clusters (discussed later) on these surface active sites to change their properties.Especially, the oxygen production property of the bare CaZrO 3 photocatalyst was much decreased by the addition of the Ag species, proposing that the positively charged Ag species varied the property of the surface oxygen sites for the water oxidation to decrease the whole photocatalytic activity. On the other hand, the moderate amount of Ag species formed nanoparticles as discussed below (Figs. 9 and 10).Thus, it is suggested that the Ag nanoparticles can selectively promote the CO 2 reduction, which is consistent with our previous study of Ag/CTO photocatalysts, where the production rate of CO also varied with the Ag loading amount and the maximum CO production rate was observed around 3.5 wt of Ag loading 12.Similar tendency was also reported 13. In the case of the BZO and Ag/BZO samples, similar results were also obtained as shown in Fig. S3.The bare BaZrO 3 sample without Ag loading exhibited a very high H 2 production rate (the left axis) and a low CO production rate (the right axis) as mentioned.The addition of tiny amount of Ag species on this sample much decreased the production rates for CO, H 2 , and O 2 , meaning that the Ag species diminished the photocatalytic active sites.Although it was not so clearly observed, the local maximum for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was observed for the sample with 3 wt of Ag loading.However, the production of H 2 and O 2 decreased continuously with increasing Ag loading.These observations are consistent with the above-mentioned trend, i.e., the addition of Ag species reduces the photocatalytic activity, while Ag nanoparticles enhance the CO 2 reduction to CO. Fig S4 shows the XRD patterns of the Ag-loaded CZO samples.The diffraction line at 38.1 is assigned to Ag metal and the intensity decreased with the decrease of the Ag loading on the samples.Fig. 9 shows a SEM image of the CZO sample loaded with 3.3 wt of Ag species recorded after the photocatalytic activity test.The Ag nanoparticles were observed on the surface of the CZO sample, where the estimated average size of the Ag nanoparticles was ca.70 nm.Fig. 10 shows DR UV-visible spectra of the Ag-loaded CZO samples after each photocatalytic reaction test.The large absorption bands were observed at 320-800 nm, which are assignable to the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of Ag nanoparticles.These results shown in Fig. S4, 9 and 10 clarified the formation of Ag nanoparticles on these Ag/CZO samples. According to the wide bandgap of the CaZrO 3 photocatalyst, these samples also exhibited other bands in the range of 230-320 nm in wavelength in Fig. 10, which are assignable to the positively charged Ag ions and clusters 3334353637.As mentioned above, addition of the Ag species decreased the photocatalytic activity.This means that, in all these samples, the photocatalytic active sites on the bare CaZrO 3 photocatalyst were diminished to some extent by the addition of these positively charged Ag species.These bands assignable to the positively charged Ag ion and clusters and the Ag nanoparticles were observed for all of these samples in Fig. 10.The former Ag species gave negative effect and the Ag nanoparticles of moderate size contributed to the CO formation.It is fact that the band shape and intensity were clearly different from each other, which evidenced that these Ag species on the calcium zirconate surface were in different states and distributions.This should provide the variation in the photocatalytic activity and selectivity."

    "title": "Conclusions",
    "content": "It was found that the bare CaZrO 3 and Ag-loaded CaZrO 3 samples exhibited photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction by using water as an electron donor.The CO selectivity in the reductive products over these alkaline-earth zirconates decreased in the following order: the bare CaZrO 3 sample the bare SrZrO 3 sample the bare BaZrO 3 sample.This order was the same as those with the Ag-loaded earth-alkaline zirconate and titanates samples.The orthorhombic perovskite structure or the larger size of the CaZrO 3 crystals would be possible reasons for the high selectivity of the CO 2 reduction. Further, the largely wide bandgap of CaZrO 3 allowed the clear observations of the Ag species in the DR UV-vis spectra, and two roles of Ag additives in the photocatalysis were revealed.The addition of Ag species on the CaZrO 3 surface gives the positively charged Ag ions and clusters that reduce the photocatalytic activity, while the deposition of Ag species with the moderate amount fabricates the Ag nanoparticles that can enhance the CO formation. In the present study, we successfully obtained some clear aspects for the photocatalytic activities of earth-alkaline zirconates and titanates photocatalysts of perovskite structures and the roles of the Ag additives on them in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction by water.The obtained aspects can contribute to further development in the field of the artificial photosynthesis.
