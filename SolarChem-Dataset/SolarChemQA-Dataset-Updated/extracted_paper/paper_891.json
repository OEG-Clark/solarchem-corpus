    "content": "Photonic crystal (PC) can manipulate light propagation due to the presence of photonic band gap (PBG).PBG can redistribute density of optical state.When the PBG overlaps with the emission of an emitter embedded in PC, the excited electrons will be prohibited from transferring to the ground state.Introducing PC with suitable PBG into photocatalyst will partially reduce the electron-hole combination and improve photocatalytic efficiency.Meanwhile, appropriate specific surface area of 3-D quasi-ordered structure can increase the contact area of catalysts and CO 2 to provide more catalytic sites, which plays an important role in the improvement of photocatalytic activity.Herein, SiO 2 Ni/TiO 2 PCs with designed PBG were fabricated and applied as catalysts for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction using Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 6H 2 O as photosensitizer.The designed SiO 2 Ni/TiO 2 PCs has a suitable specific surface area and certain surface roughness, which can effectively adsorb CO 2 for photocatalytic reduction.Meanwhile, the PBG of SiO 2 Ni/TiO 2 PCs matches well with the electron-hole combination energy of the photosensitizer, the electron-hole combination process from the excited state falling back to the ground state can be prevented partially.Suppressing the falling of excited electrons will make electrons transfer to the catalyst, thereby improving the photocatalytic performance."

    "content": "Monodisperse SiO 2 spheres were synthesized via a modified Stober method 27.Firstly, silica seeds were prepared as follows: EtOH (160 mL), deionized water (DI) (33 mL) and ammonia solution (3.2 mL) were added into a singlenecked flask (500 mL) with stirring at 60 C for 40 min.Then, TEOS (4.4 mL) was added to the above mixture in a speed of 0.2 mL min -1 and the mixture reacted to get the seed dispersions for 10 h under stirring condition.In the subsequent growth process, a certain volume of seed was added into the mixture of ethanol (EtOH, 160 mL), water (DI) (40 mL) and ammonia solution (NH 3 H 2 O, 40 mL) in the three-necked flask (500 mL), then TEOS (20 mL) and solution of DI/EtOH/NH 3 H 2 O (3 mL/10 mL/8-9 mL) were added dropwise simultaneously in a speed of 0.2 mL min -1 into the three-necked flask, and the mixture reacted for another 5 h.The products were washed three times with EtOH and dried at 60 C for the further use.The particles diameters of SiO 2 spheres can be controlled by adjusting the amount of seeds (1-4 mL).200 nm, 250 nm and 300 nm SiO 2 microspheres were prepared by this method. Monodisperse SiO 2 NiSiO 3 spheres were prepared through a modified hydrothermal process 28.Firstly, 0.5 g of prepared SiO 2 particles were dispersed in DI (20 mL) to form the colloidal dispersions under ultrasonic condition.Then NiCl 2 6H 2 O (15 mmol), NH 4 Cl (10 mmol) and trisodium citrate (2.7 mmol) were mixed in DI (60 mL), and ammonia solution was added to the above mixture under stirring to adjust the pH value of the reaction system at 9. The above solution was mixed with the SiO 2 colloidal dispersions under vigorous ultrasonic from the homogeneous solutions, then transferred the homogeneous solutions into an autoclave (100 mL) and reacted at 120 C for 14 h.The light green precipitates were obtained after cooling to room temperature and washed three times with DI and EtOH.Finally, the SiO 2 NiSiO 3 products were dried at 60 C. To get the PC structure, a certain amount of SiO 2 NiSiO 3 powder was added into the ethanol under vigorous ultrasonic to prepared 6 (wt) of SiO 2 NiSiO 3 dispersion.Then SiO 2 NiSiO 3 PCs were assembled by consecutive dip-coating strategy on the surface of glass.The pulling speed is 2 m s -1 and three pulling cycles were used to fabricate the SiO 2 NiSiO 3 PCs.Finally, the TiO 2 precursors were filled into the voids of the PCs, which was prepared by absolute ethanol (6 mL) and TBT (300 L).After drying in vacuum and scraping off the templates from the glass, the SiO 2 Ni/TiO 2 PCs was obtained under 5 H 2 /N 2 at 800 C for 2 h. One mg of SiO 2 Ni/TiO 2 PCs powder, 8 mg of Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 6H 2 O and 1 mL of TEOA were added into a Schlenk flask containing mixture of acetonitrile/DI (4 mL/1 mL), and the Schlenk flask was sealed with Vaseline.Then the CO 2 with high purity was continuously passed into the flask under stirring.A 300 W xenon lamp with a 400 nm cut-off filter was applied to simulating visible light.0.5 mL of gaseous product was taken out the reactor using 1 mL syringe every 1 h, and the gaseous products were qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed by gas chromatography.The reactor temperature was maintained at 25 C using a water cooling system, which is regulated by circulating cooling water.Because photosensitizers are sensitive to light even may be decomposed by light, therefore they should be kept away from light before the photocatalytic reaction. The reflectance spectra of SiO 2 NiSiO 3 PCs and SiO 2 Ni/TiO 2 PCs was performed using a Hitachi U-4100 spectrophotometer.The crystal forms of samples were studied by Powder X-ray diffraction measurements (XRD, Rigaku D/MAX-2400 diffractometer).The surface topography of samples was performed by FE-SEM (Nova Nanosem 450 field emission scanning electron microscope).The morphology of internal structure SiO 2 and SiO 2 /NiSiO 3 spheres was measured by Transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI TF30 transmission electron microscope) at 300 kV.The steady state emission spectra were obtained with Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer.Surface element and valence state analysis of the samples were recorded with an X-ray photoelectron spectroscope (XPS, ESCALab 250, Thermo VG).The C 1 s peak with a binding energy of 284.8 eV was the basis of spectral analysis.Ultraviolet-Visible (UV-Vis) spectrum was recorded with an Agilent 8453 by dissolving Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 6H 2 O (4 mg) into the mixture of acetonitrile (4 mL) and H 2 O (1 mL).The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area and porous structure were measured using a 3H-2000PM2 instrument from N 2 adsorption and desorption isotherms at 77 K.The pictures of the SiO 2 NiSiO 3 PCs were taken by iPhone.The gaseous products (CO and H 2 ) were collected in the syringe and analyzed using a gas chromatograph (GC, Techcomp 7900 and Techcomp 7890) with a FID detector and a TCD detector.The FID and TCD detectors detected CO and H 2 at a detection limit of 0.5 ppm."

    "content": "In order to obtain PC structure with enhanced photocatalytic activity, SiO 2 spheres with certain diameter were selected as the building matrix for surface modification and assembly.As shown in Scheme 1, monodisperse silica microspheres were first prepared by modified Stober method.Silicate ions were generated on the surface of SiO 2 under alkaline conditions at high temperature, reacting directly with the nickel ions to form NiSiO 3 nanoparticles around the SiO 2 core 29.Next, the monodisperse SiO 2 NiSiO 3 microspheres were assembled into PCs with appropriate PBG by consecutive dip-coating strategy.Then, TiO 2 precursor was filled into the interspaces of PCs template, after drying in vacuum and scraping the template off the glasses and SiO 2 NiSiO 3 /TiO 2 composites were successfully prepared.Finally, SiO 2 Ni/ TiO 2 PC photocatalyst was obtained by sintering SiO 2 NiSiO 3 /TiO 2 in a hydrogen atmosphere at high temperature. SEM and TEM were first applied to investigating the microstructure of catalysts at different stages of the preparation process.In Fig. 1a, the average particle size of SiO 2 spheres was 300 nm.The surface of SiO 2 spheres became rougher, thin nanosheets distributed on the surface of SiO 2 spheres after hydrothermal reaction with nickel chloride hexahydrate under alkaline conditions (Fig. 1b), indicating that SiO 2 NiSiO 3 spheres were successfully obtained.The XRD pattern of SiO 2 NiSiO 3 in Fig. 1e further confirmed that NiSiO 3 (JCPDS no.43-0664) was formed.After TiO 2 precursors infiltrated into the assembled SiO 2 NiSiO 3 PCs, SiO 2 Ni/TiO 2 PCs were formed at 800 C in 5 H 2 /N 2 gas. In Fig. 1c, although we scraped off the glass slide, quasi-ordered PCs structure of photocatalyst fragments is still maintained, and the surface of the structure becomes rougher.XRD pattern clearly shows that the designed structure was composed of rutile (JCPDS no.21-1276)/anatase (JCPDS no.21-1272) TiO 2 , Ni (hexagonal-phase) (JCPDS no.45-1027) and SiO 2 (in Fig. 1f).Meanwhile, the element content and composition of the prepared SiO 2 NiSiO 3 spheres and SiO 2 Ni/TiO 2 spheres were studied by EDS test (as shown in Figs.S1 andS2).The element mapping of the SEM image shows that Ni and Ti were uniformly dispersed in the prepared composite structure. It is well known that the valence states of TiO 2 and Ni have a significant effect on the catalytic performance.In our design, Ti 4 and Ni are used as synergistic photocatalysts for photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 XPS was recorded to identify the chemical valance state and composition of the SiO 2 Ni/TiO 2 PCs. Figure 1g The reflection spectrum of SiO 2 NiSiO 3 PCs film with diameter of 300 nm was measured, which is located at 624 nm (Fig. S3).It was similar to the PC built by pure SiO 2 spheres calculated in supporting information.After TiO 2 precursor penetrated into the assembled SiO 2 NiSiO 3 PCs, NiSiO 3 was reduced to Ni and TiO 2 crystal forms changes into rutile/anatase from amorphous structure, thereby forming SiO 2 Ni/TiO 2 PCs.The PBG of SiO 2 Ni/TiO 2 PCs is located at 615 nm (Fig. 2a).The blue-shift of PBG was ascribed to the particle size shrinkage of SiO 2 spheres during high temperature calcination 30. In the reaction system, the electrons in ground state (S 0 ) of Ru(bpy) 3 2 will transfer to the excited state (S 1 ) under simulated light irradiation.In Fig. 2b, the energy level difference between the excited state (S 1 , with potential of -1.53 eV) and ground state (S 0 , with potential of 1.22 eV) of photosensitizer is 2.75 eV 31, the corresponding excitation wavelength is 451 nm calculated Scheme 1 Schematic illustration of the preparation strategy of SiO 2 Ni/TiO 2 PC photocatalyst by Eq. 1, which corresponds to the absorption position of photosensitizer.The absorption peak of Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 6H 2 O is located at 452 nm (Fig. 2c), which can be assigned to the metal-to-ligand charge-transfer (MLCT) character 32.It shows that Ru(bpy) 3 2 exhibits an excellent light adsorption capability in the visible light region. As shown in Fig. 2b, the energy level difference between triplet excited state (T 1 , with potential of -0.82 eV) and S 0 of photosensitizer is 2.04 eV, the corresponding emission wavelength is 607 nm calculated by Eq. 1.It can be obtained from the emission spectrum of the photosensitizer (Ru(bpy) 3 2 ) (inset in Fig. 2b) that the emission peak is located at 605 nm.During the reaction process, some of excited electrons at S 1 will transfer to T 1 and back to S 0 companied by energy release in the form of phosphorescence.This is consistent with the PBG position of the designed SiO 2 Ni/TiO 2 PC. According to theory 11, the density of optical state is very low and the light is prohibited from waving in the PBG.It can be expected that the combination of electron and hole will be partially prohibited, which increases the population of excited electrons transferred to the catalyst for achieving better catalytic effect. Detailed photocatalytic reduction mechanism using the prepared photocatalyst was shown in Fig. 2d, which can be described in the following equations.Firstly, photosensitizer (Ru(bpy) 3 2 ) was excited to form excited state of Ru(bpy) 3 2 (electron-hole pairs) under visible light irradiation (Eq.2).The excited electrons transfer to catalyst at the interface between SiO 2 Ni/TiO 2 PC and Ru(bpy) 3 2 (Eq.3), Then, SiO 2 Ni/TiO 2 PC catalyst was used to reduce CO 2 to CO and H 2 (Eq.4).Finally, the Ru(bpy) 3 3 returned to the initial state by oxidizing TEOA (Eq.5).The enhanced photocatalytic capability of SiO 2 Ni/TiO 2 PCs can promote the transferring of excited electrons, thereby forming a high concentration of delocalized electrons for CO 2 reduction, which is conducive to enhance the photocatalytic efficiency of CO 2 conversion. To evaluate the photocatalytic effect of SiO 2 Ni/TiO 2 PC catalyst, photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 was performed using SiO 2 TiO 2 powder, SiO 2 Ni powder, SiO 2 Ni/TiO 2 powder and SiO 2 Ni/TiO 2 PC as catalysts, and blank experiment without photocatalysts was carried out to eliminate the contribution of the photosensitizer under same light irradiation.Figure 3a andb show the results of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to produce CO and H 2 .Once without photocatalysts for the photocatalytic reduction system, the evolution rate of both CO (0.12 mol mg -1 h -1 ) and H 2 (0.1 mol mg -1 h -1 ) is substantially decreased.The evolution of CO increased linearly with irradiation time, which indicates that the catalyst exhibits good stability.SiO 2 Ni/TiO 2 PC exhibits the highest CO evolution rate of 2.58 mol mg -1 h -1 (yield: 10.3 mol) under light irradiation for 4 h.The CO evolution rate of 0.23 mol mg -1 h -1 (yield: 0.91 mol), 0.1.18mol mg -1 h -1 (yield: 4.7 mol) and 1.88 mol mg -1 h -1 (yield: 7.5 mol) were obtained for SiO 2 TiO 2 powder, SiO 2 Ni powder and SiO 2 Ni/TiO 2 powder.SiO 2 Ni powder has a certain photocatalytic effect, mainly because Ni has a strong adsorption ability of CO 2 for photocatalytic reduction.Excitingly, the photocatalyst with designed PC structure assembled by SiO 2 Ni/TiO 2 exhibited better photocatalytic effect than the disordered SiO 2 Ni/TiO 2 powder as what we have expected.The results of H 2 evolution rates over the four materials show that SiO 2 Ni/TiO 2 PC has superior activity to SiO 2 TiO 2 powder, SiO 2 Ni powder, and SiO 2 Ni/TiO 2 powder as well.The results proved that the photocatalyst with appropriate PBG partially promotes the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.Meanwhile, when Ni and TiO 2 exist simultaneously in the catalytic system, the photocatalytic effect is significantly higher than that of the photocatalyst only doped with Ni or TiO 2 , which means that the strong adsorption ability of Ni to CO 2 can effectively improve the photocatalytic activity. To investigate the effect of surface area of the designed structure on the catalytic efficiency, N 2 adsorption/desorption isotherms of SiO 2 TiO 2 powder, SiO 2 Ni powder, SiO 2 Ni/TiO 2 powder and SiO 2 Ni/TiO 2 PC were measured and displayed in Fig. 3c andd.The BET surface area of SiO 2 TiO 2 powder, SiO 2 Ni powder and SiO 2 Ni/ TiO 2 powder are 24.9 m 2 g -1 , 31.5 m 2 g -1 and 32.4 m 2 g -1 , respectively, and there is no obvious pore size distribution (Fig. 3d).The BET surface area of SiO 2 Ni/TiO 2 PC is 23.2 m 2 g -1 , and the corresponding average pore diameter is 3.7 nm.The BET surface area of SiO 2 TiO 2 powder, SiO 2 Ni powder and SiO 2 Ni/TiO 2 powder is slightly larger than that of SiO 2 Ni/TiO 2 PC.The close contact between the spheres leads to the decrease of specific surface area after assembly into PC.The photocatalytic effect of SiO 2 Ni/TiO 2 PC and SiO 2 Ni/TiO 2 powder is significantly higher than that of SiO 2 TiO 2 powder and SiO 2 Ni powder, because the adsorption affinity of Ni for CO 2 can effectively promote the photocatalytic activity of TiO 2 .The SiO 2 Ni/TiO 2 PC has the best photocatalytic effect, indicating that the PC structure can promote photocatalytic reduction activity in some degree.On the other hand, as shown in Fig. S5, the surface of SiO 2 Ni/TiO 2 PC is rougher than that of SiO 2 Ni/TiO 2 powder, which is favorable to the CO 2 adsorption on its surface to some extent. To prove a certain role of matched PBG in improving photocatalytic reactions, monodisperse SiO 2 spheres with different particle sizes were used to fabricate photocatalyst with different PBG.As shown in Fig. 4a andd, 200 nm and 250 nm monodisperse SiO 2 spheres were selected, and the same operation was performed to prepare complex structure.Corresponding SiO 2 NiSiO 3 spheres obtained under hydrothermal condition using SiO 2 spheres as templates (Fig. 4b ande).The monodisperse SiO 2 NiSiO 3 spheres were assembled into PCs by consecutive dip-coating strategy, and Fig. 3 a CO and b H 2 evolution over SiO 2 TiO 2 powder, SiO 2 Ni powder, SiO 2 Ni/TiO 2 powder and SiO 2 Ni/TiO 2 PC as catalysts for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.c N 2 -adsorption-desorption iso-therms and d pore size distribution of SiO 2 TiO 2 powder, SiO 2 Ni powder, SiO 2 Ni/TiO 2 powder and SiO 2 Ni/TiO 2 PC the reflection spectra of the SiO 2 NiSiO 3 PCs are centered at 550 nm (green) and 444 nm (blue) (Fig. S4) (the incident angle is 10), respectively.After TiO 2 filling and calcination, the reflection positions of SiO 2 Ni/TiO 2 PCs were located at 436 nm (blue) and 539 nm (green) (the incident angle is 10) and not related with electron-hole combination energy of Ru(bpy) 3 2 (Fig. 4c andf). A intense broad band centered at 605 nm was observed in the steady state emission spectrum of photosensitizer (Ru(bpy) 3 2 ) in the mixture of DI and acetonitrile (V DI : V acetonitrile 1: 4), which caused by the recombination of excited electrons and holes.However, the emission intensity of the SiO 2 Ni/TiO 2 PC was obviously decreased when 300 nm-SiO 2 Ni/TiO 2 PC was added to the mixture (Fig. 5a), which indicates that the recombination of photogenerated carriers was effectively inhibited.This promotes the separation of photo-generated carriers at the interface of Ru(bpy) 3 2 and SiO 2 Ni/TiO 2 PC.Excited electrons will migrate to SiO 2 Ni/TiO 2 PC for reducing CO 2 .The properties of the emission spectra were not changed significantly.It may be due to the fact that Ni and TiO 2 doped on the surface of SiO 2 spheres make the surface of the spheres rough.As shown in Figs.S5, the SiO 2 Ni/TiO 2 PC has a quasi-ordered structure, which limited their effect on the photosensitizer's emission.Moreover, the interspaces of the assembled SiO 2 Ni/TiO 2 PC were doped with Ni and TiO 2 , which will affect the contact between the PC and the photosensitizer.Meanwhile, the refractive index contrast between SiO 2 ( 1.46), acetonitrile ( 1.34) and water ( 1.33) is small in the mixed solution of acetonitrile and water, which reduces the manipulating ability of light 33.Therefore, the emission spectra shape of the doped catalyst changes small. As shown in Fig. 5b, SiO 2 Ni/TiO 2 PCs with different PBG were used as catalyst, the generation of CO increases linearly with irradiation time.300 nm-SiO 2 Ni/TiO 2 PC exhibited the highest CO evolution rate of 2.58 mol mg -1 h -1 (yield: 10.3 mol).The CO evolution rate of 1.1 mol mg -1 h -1 (yield: 4.4 mol) and 2.23 mol mg -1 h -1 (yield: 8.9 mol) were obtained for 200 nm-SiO 2 Ni/TiO 2 PC and 250 nm-SiO 2 Ni/TiO 2 PC.Meanwhile, the evolution rates of H 2 over the three materials show (Fig. 5c) that 300 nm-SiO 2 Ni/TiO 2 PC has superior activity to 200 nm-SiO 2 Ni/TiO 2 PC and 250 nm-SiO 2 Ni/TiO 2 PC as well.The photocatalytic reduction performance is indicated by the emission yield of CO.As shown in Fig. 5b, the yield of CO by 300 nm-SiO 2 Ni/TiO 2 is the highest. The catalytic stability of 300 nm-SiO 2 Ni/TiO 2 PC catalyst for CO 2 reduction was investigated by the four-cycle tests under same light irradiation.The results are shown in Fig. 5d, the formation rates of H 2 and CO products have not changed obviously during four-cycle experiments, so the 300 nm-SiO 2 Ni/TiO 2 PC photocatalyst possess good stability.For 200 nm-SiO 2 Ni/TiO 2 PC catalyst, the production of CO is obviously lower.It can be seen from Fig. 5e and f that the BET surface area of 200 nm-SiO 2 Ni/TiO 2 PC and 250 nm-SiO 2 Ni/TiO 2 PC are 17.3 m 2 g -1 and 18.5 m 2 g -1 , and the corresponding average pore size is 3.5 nm and 3.1 nm, respectively.The high BET surface area can effectively adsorb more CO 2 for photocatalytic reduction.Furthermore, in Figs.S5, the surface of 200 nm-SiO 2 Ni/ TiO 2 PC is smoother than that of 300 nm-SiO 2 Ni/TiO 2 PC, which is not favorable to the CO 2 adsorption on its surface.Therefore, in addition to inhibiting electron-hole recombination through matching with the electron-hole combination energy of photosensitizer, the high BET surface area is also conducive to CO 2 adsorption."

    "content": "In conclusion, SiO 2 Ni/TiO 2 PCs with different PBG and stages were fabricated and applied as catalyst for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction under mild conditions.The 300 nm-SiO 2 Ni/TiO 2 PC catalyst has a high BET surface area and rough surface, which facilitates the CO 2 adsorption for photocatalytic reduction.Moreover, when the PBG of SiO 2 Ni/TiO 2 PCs matches well with the electron-hole combination energy, the enhanced photocatalytic reduction activity can be realized because electron-hole combination was partially prohibited due to the low photo effect of PBG.This work shows that PC with an appropriate BET surface area combined with specific PBG can improve the adsorption of CO 2 and reduce the recombination rate of electrons-holes, which possess huge application prospect in the field of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction. clearly demonstrated that the SiO 2 Ni/TiO 2 PCs composes of Ti, Ni, O and Si elements.In Fig. 1h, 464.2 and 458.7 eV are assigned to Ti 2p 1/2 and Ti 2p 3/2 of TiO 2 .As shown in Fig. 1i, 873.7 and 856.1 eV are assigned to Ni2p 1/2 and Ni 2p 3/2 of Ni.The small peak at 880.1 eV is attributed to NiO.XPS confirms the existence of NiO, but it is not detected by XRD in Fig. 1f because of the small content.
