    "content": "Recent studies have shown that optically excited diamond can act as a solid-state source of solvated electrons in aqueous media, leading to novel reduction reactions such as the one-electron activation pathway (CO 2 e - -CO 2-, E 0 -1.9V vs SHE) for reduction of CO 2 to CO.However, an understanding of the valence band reactions is also essential, especially since CO can also be produced in the absence of CO 2 by oxidation of diamond via C H 2 O CO 2H 2e -(E 0 0.52 V).Here, we demonstrate that Hterminated diamond nanoparticles with a median diameter of 125 nm can initiate selective photochemical reduction of CO 2 to CO, and that argon-purged control samples show no production of CO production in the absence of intentional CO 2 reactant as long as a sacrificial electron donor (here, Na 2 SO 3 ) is present."

Preparation of H-terminated Diamond Nanoparticles.Experiments reported here used natural diamond nanoparticles with a median size of 125 nm (NAT 0-0.25 m, median size 0.125 m, Microdiamant AG).Diamond samples were first annealed at 410C in air for 4-5 hours to remove graphitic overlayers and were then annealed at 750C in pure H 2 (760 torr, flow rate 50 standard cubic centimeters per minute) for 5 hours to hydrogen-terminate the diamond surfaces.Figure S1a in Supplemental Information shows a scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of the diamond nanoparticles, while Figure S2b shows the Raman spectrum using 532 nm excitation.The SEM images show that the nanoparticles exhibit well-defined facets characteristic of crystalline diamond, with sizes ranging from 20 nm to approximately 200 nm for the largest dimension.The Raman spectrum in Figure S2b shows a sharp peak at 1332 cm -1 characteristic of crystalline diamond 11,12.Beneath the diamond peak is a small broad band centering around 1350 cm -1 that is commonly referred to as the \"D band\" and is attributed to grain boundary defects 13,14.Finally, the broad band centered at 1580 cm -1 , commonly referred to as the \"G band\", is characteristic of sp 2 -hybridized carbon 14151617.The sharpness of the 1332 cm -1 peak and the weak intensity of the \"D band\" and \"G band\" indicate that the diamond nanoparticles are of high crystallographic quality 13,15,16 Further data characterizing the diamond nanoparticles by Raman spectroscopy and by X-ray diffraction are included in Supplementary Information.Figure S4 shows (111) and (220) peaks in x-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of natural diamond nanoparticles. Detonation Nanodiamond.Detonation nanodiamond (6 nm average particle size, Stock 1321JGY, Nanostructured Amorphous Materials Inc.) was used for comparison.Detonation nanodiamond samples were first treated at 410C in air to selectively remove sp 2 hybridized carbon 18, and then treated under H 2 gas flow at 500C for 5 hours for surface H-termination (760 torr, flow rate 50 standard cubic centimeters per minute).The H-termination procedure is similar to that reported by Williams and coworkers who showed that this procedure is effective at H-termination of nanodiamond in this size range 19. Photochemical reduction of CO 2 .Photochemical reduction of CO 2 was performed in a pressurized vessel, and the amount of CO produced was determined by analyzing the gaseous head space above the aqueous sample using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy of the CO rotational-vibrational bands. Detailed procedures are presented in the Supplemental Information. Previous studies have shown that facile electron emission and photocatalytic activity of planar diamond samples are not achieved on oxidized samples, and that it is necessary to terminate the surface with hydrogen 234520 or with protonated amino groups 20.These surface terminations are essential because they provide a electrostatic potentials at the very surface that allow electrons in the bulk conduction band to escape into the adjacent medium with little or no barrier 34520.Figure 2 demonstrates the successful preparation of H-terminated diamond nanoparticles, using Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform Spectroscopy (DRIFTS) to characterize the infrared spectra after different annealing conditions.Additional characterization of the 125 nm diameter diamond particles via scanning electron microscopy and by Raman spectroscopy are shown in Supplemental Information Fig. S1.In the DRIFTS spectra of Figure 2, three regions are labeled: C-H stretching vibration region (2980 -2800 cm -1 ) 21222324, CO stretching vibration region (1950 -1630 cm -1 ) 212223 and a more complex region (1500 -900 cm -1 ) that contains features from several vibrational modes including C-O stretching (1200 -1000 cm -1 ) 25, C-C stretching(band around 1330 cm -1 ) 21, O-H deformation (1440 -1260 cm - 1 ) 25, and C-H deformation (1470 -1260 cm -1 ) 22,25.The as-received sample shows peaks at 1092 and 1735 cm -1 .After annealing in air at 410C, the CO stretching vibration region increases in intensity and shifts to 1808 cm -1 , and new prominent peaks appear at 1485 cm -1 , 1320 cm -1 and 1109 cm -1 .The shift in CO frequency from 1735 cm -1 to 1800 cm -1 shows a transition in carbonyl groups from ketones, aldehydes, and esters to acids, anhydrides or cyclic ketones 18.After the diamond sample is annealed in H 2 at 750C, an intense peak at 2833 cm -1 appears along with a shoulder near 2850 cm -1 and a broad feature near 2940 cm -1 .The sharp 2833 cm -1 peak is identical to that reported for the single C-H stretching mode of H-terminated diamond (111) 26, while the 2850 cm -1 and 2940 cm - shown that hydrogen termination of diamond leads to a positive value of 40 mV at acidic and neutral pH values 19,27, while oxygen termination leads to negative values of -40 mV when measured at pH 5 27.Thus, we conclude that the procedures we followed were effective at H-terminating the diamond surfaces.) anion has been shown previously to be an effective electron donor (hole scavenger) at other solid-electrolyte interfaces 28 and has a redox potential suitable for use with diamond 29.Secondly, a mixture containing both Na 2 SO 4 and Na 2 SO 3 creates an electrochemical buffer that fixes the electrochemical potential of the diamond surface 30.Based on the half-reaction reaction 4 2- 2 - 2 3 2- 2 -, E o -0.93 V vs SHE 29, and using pH3.2 for the pH of water saturated with CO 2 at a pressure of 350 psi (or 2.5 MPa) 31, the potential of the solution in contact with the diamond nanoparticles is fixed at a value of E -0.30V vs SHE.This also represents the potential of the diamond nanoparticle Fermi level after equilibration with the solution.The potential of -0.30V vs. SHE is approximately 0.5 V more negative than that reported for diamond in contact with air-saturated water 30.As discussed below, this negative potential helps to ensure downward band-bending at the diamond-electrolyte interface instead of the upward band-bending reported for diamond in contact with O 2 -saturated water 30,32,33. Previous studies of undoped diamond samples have typically reported bulk valence band positions approximately 0.9 eV below E F 32.Fig. 3 To evaluate the ability of the Hterminated diamond nanoparticle to initiate CO 2 reduction, the diamond dispersion was placed into a UV-grade fused silica cell that was placed inside a custom-built high-pressure vessel with a 0.5 cm 2 fused silica window for illumination.Figure S3 (Supplementary Information) shows the experimental apparatus.The high-pressure vessel was then purged and pressurized with CO 2 to 350 psi and the diamond solution was illuminated with ultraviolet light from a broadband HgXe lamp for 16 hours.Gas-phase products were then released into a custom-built FTIR transmission cell and analyzed via FTIR at 1 atmosphere pressure. Figure 4 shows FTIR spectra of the gas-phase headspace after illuminating diamond nanoparticles in in CO 2 -saturated water (350 psi pressure) for 16 hours, along with similar spectra for control experiments. The spectrum is resolved into a series of sharp features corresponding to individual rotational-vibrational transitions.Unreacted CO 2 gives rise to a series of lines extending from 2080 cm -1 to 2130 cm -1 .The CO product gives rise to two rotational-vibrational branches: the P branch (2140 cm -1 to 2090 cm -1 ) and shows little or no production of CO.A small amount of CO is produced from the \"No diamond\" and \"No electron donor\" sample; this arises from the fact that CO 2 has a small amount of intrinsic photochemical activity at short wavelengths 36. Importantly, the \"No diamond\" and \"No electron donor\" both show the same low level of reactivity; this confirms that the sulfite anion does not have any photochemical activity of its own under the conditions of our experiment.We calibrated our experimental apparatus to establish the absolute CO yield, obtaining 120 g.This is slightly smaller than the value of 300 g we reported previously using a solid borondoped diamond substrate 6.While there are many differences between samples, the similarity in overall yield suggests that the reaction kinetics on planar surfaces and nanoparticles may be similar. .Also shown are results from four different control samples each eliminating one of the following: the SO 3 2-electron donor, the diamond nanoparticles, the UV illumination, and the CO 2 . Distribution of reaction products.To determine whether other reaction products are present in significant quantities, we used 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to search for methanol, formic acid, and other possible products.We were not able to detect any other products in the liquid phase at the signal-to-noise limit of the instrument even with repeated signal-averaging.By making standards with known concentrations, we determined that the detection limit for possible products of interest (such as methanol and formic acid) is 0.5 mg/L (corresponding to 40 g of products in the volume of solution used in our experiments).This compares with 120 g of gas-phase CO observed.Based on the solutionphase detection limit, we conclude that CO must be 75 of the total reaction product, although we cannot rule out smaller amounts of other products. To determine whether the ability of diamond nanoparticles to initiate photochemical reduction of CO 2 depends on the nature of the diamond, we performed comparison experiments using H-terminated particles of detonation nanodiamond 17,37 having an average diameter of 6 nm. Figure S6 (Supplementary Information) shows representative DRIFTS spectra for detonation nanodiamond before and after H-termination.H-termination produces C-H stretching modes at 2882 and 2946 cm -1 characteristic of the asymmetric and symmetric stretching modes of surface CH 2 groups, but lacking the sharp feature at 2833 cm -1 associated with H-termination of the (111) crystal face.These samples yielded a large, positive zeta potential of 48.41.9 mV, establishing successful H-termination of the surfaces 19.When this nanodiamond was used in a manner equivalent to the experiments described above, we did not observe any significant production of CO.Fig. S7 in Supplementary Information shows the FTIR spectrum of the head-space after illumination with UV light under conditions identical to those used with the larger diamond nanoparticles.While illumination of detonation nanodiamond in the CO 2 Na 2 SO 3 Na 2 SO 4 solution produces a very small amount of CO, the amount does not rise above the baseline level of what is produced by direct photodissociation of CO 2 . Influence of illumination on diamond nanoparticles.In previous work we showed that bulk diamond immersed in water loses its surface H-termination after extensive exposure to deep UV light, and that this leads to a decrease in the ability to emit electrons and/or to induce photo-reduction reactions 2,7.In order to understand how illumination conditions affect surface termination of H-terminated diamond nanoparticles, we performed dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements for solutions before and after different photochemical reduction conditions.Figure 5 and this solution was pressurized with Ar and then illuminated.The \"No CO 2 control\" shows some aggregation to approximately 270 nm, but this aggregation is still substantially less than that observed when CO 2 , UV light, and the Na 2 SO 3 /Na 2 SO 4 are all present simultaneously. The present work shows four important results.First, the data in Fig. 4 show that H-terminated diamond nanoparticles of 125 nm diameter can induce photochemical reduction of CO 2 to CO when illuminated with UV light.Secondly, the control experiments show that CO is only produced in significant quantities when UV light, CO 2 , and the SO 3 2-sacrificial electron donor are present simultaneously.Third, that the major product of CO 2 reduction is CO, with all other products below the detection limits established by NMR.Finally, while the H-termination of diamond nanoparticles is eventually degraded leading to aggregation of the nanoparticles, this degradation is not significant unless CO 2 , UV light, and the SO 3 2-electron donor are present simultaneously. The present results are consistent with results we reported previously on planar diamond 2,6, and clarify seemingly disparate results obtained using detonation nanodiamond 7.In our earlier work using planar diamond 6, we showed that H-termination of planar diamond induces negative electron affinity and allows electrons excited to diamond's conduction band to be emitted into water with little or no barrier, forming solvated electrons.Solvated electrons then react rapidly with CO 2 at the pressures used here to produce the radical anion CO 2 - , which is photochemically active and dissociates to produce CO and the atomic oxygen anion, O - 38.However, when we attempted to extend that work to 5-6 nm \"detonation\" nanodiamond, we found that illumination under argon-purged conditions (with no CO 2 present) produced significant amounts of CO 7.On that basis we concluded that when using detonation nanodiamond, a significant amount of the CO comes from oxidation of the nanodiamond, rather than from reduction of CO 2 7.Similarly, in the present work we again find that detonation nanodiamond is not an effective catalyst, yielding no significant amount of CO compared to the control experiments.In A N U S C R I P T fact, in the present work we find that detonation nanodiamond in contact with CO 2 at 25 atmospheres pressure yields approximately the same amount of CO as we observed previously 6 with the same material with CO 2 at 1 atmosphere pressure.The fact that the yield of CO from DND does not depend on the pressure of CO 2 in the reaction vessel further supports the idea that illuminated detonation nanodiamond produces CO primarily by oxidation of the diamond particles.In contrast, using higher quality natural diamond nanoparticles yields much more positive results as demonstrated in Figure 4. We believe the dramatic difference in behavior between natural diamond nanoparticles reported here and detonation nanodiamond(DND) reported previously arises from several factors.First, we consider the crystallinity of the materials.The natural diamond samples we use here exhibit well-defined facets in SEM (Supplemental Information Fig. S1a), and a sharp 1332 cm -1 peak in Raman (Supp.Inf. Figure S1b), suggesting that the surface and bulk are both well-ordered with high crystallinity.Furthermore, the FTIR data (Figure 3) show a sharp vibrational mode characteristic of the C-H bond on diamond (111) samples. Taken together, the XRD, SEM, Raman, and FTIR data all indicate that the natural diamond nanoparticles are well ordered both in the bulk and at their surfaces.In contrast, the DND sample shows poor Raman characteristics (Figure S1, Supplementary information) and has been shown previously to have a high concentration of surface defects and possibly incomplete H-termination 39,40.We propose that the large amounts of under-coordinated C atoms of DND likely have higher reactivity and are more easily removed from the lattice compared with the C atoms within well-structured (111) planes that predominate with natural diamond nanoparticles.Thus, our data suggest that high crystalline perfection may be important in achieving good photochemical reduction without reaction of the diamond core. While natural diamond exhibit improved photocatalytic properties compared with detonation diamond, the DLS data in Fig. 5 show that even the high-quality natural diamond particles aggregate.However, it is important that aggregation is much more substantial under conditions where CO 2 reduction is most efficient -i.e., illumination in the presence of CO 2 with SO 3 However, the valence band is relatively shallow and is diamond has a high overpotential for water oxidation 33.Direct oxidation of diamond itself via C H 2 O CO 2H 2e -is unlikely because the standard reduction potential for the reverse reaction CO 2H 2e - C H 2 O is 0.518V vs. SHE, which translates to a formal potential of 0.329 V vs. SHE at pH3.2.Since the valence band of Hterminated diamond has been independently determined to be near 0 V vs. SHE 33, we conclude that oxidation of C with H 2 O would present a barrier of 0.5 eV per electron or 1 eV per C atom.We believe the key piece of evidence is that diamond aggregation does not occur unless the hole scavenger SO 3 2-is present.Based on this, we believe that diamond oxidation and aggregation are likely induced by reactive oxygen species produced from the reduction of CO 2 .The presence of a hole scavenger (electron then photodissociates in the presence of UV light to produce CO and the atomic oxygen anion, O - 38. Prior studies have shown that O is able to rapidly abstract H from alkanes 41.Alternatively, O could react with H in solution to produce the hydroxyl radical OH 42, which is also known to effectively abstract H atoms from alkanes 43.We believe it likely that any reactant able to abstract H from an alkane is likely to be able to do so from H-terminated diamond surfaces.Once H is abstracted from diamond, the resulting \"dangling bond\" is expected to be highly reactive and able to react with water to form various surface oxidation products.Thus, our data supports the overall series of reaction steps indicated in Figure 6. Reduction of CO 2 to CO has also been reported electrochemically, frequently using Cu metal as an electrode material44-48 or using Cu-modified diamond.48 In these studies, Cu is used because it provides a high overpotential for H reduction to H 2 and is sufficiently reactive to locally concentrate surface hydrogen atoms and various CO 2 reduction intermediates.However, this ability also results in various surface C-C coupling reactions and wide range of resulting products.In contrast, reduction in homogenous solution initiated by direct photoelectron injection leads almost entirely to CO due to the vastly different mechanisms.One the diamond surface there are few (if any) labile H atoms, and neither the reactants nor the products of CO 2 reduction have any significant tendency to bind to the surface, thereby drastically reducing the propensity to initiate C-C coupling reactions Thus, the UV-illuminated Hterminated diamond surface can act as a nearly inert source of electrons to directly and selectively reduce CO 2 to CO. Diamond nanoparticles can be photocatalysts for selective reduction of CO 2 to CO when illuminated with ultraviolet light.However, that catalysis is only effective when a hole scavenger such as sulfite ion is present and when the diamond has relatively high crystal quality, in order to avoid etching of the diamond Figure1shows the approximate band Fig. 1 .Energy band diagram of H-terminated diamond and some other semiconductors, together with related redox reactions of interest 1 features are characteristic of the asymmetric and symmetric modes of -CH 2 groups.Notably, we do not observe any features near 2970 cm -1 where -CH 3 modes would be expected.X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data for H-terminated diamond nanoparticles are shown in Supplemental Information, Figure S5; those data show that the sample has very little surface oxygen and no other detectable impurities, confirming effective Htermination of the surface.Zeta potential measurements of aqueous solutions dispersed with diamond nanoparticles were also used to evaluate the surface termination in aqueous dispersions.The solution dispersed with diamond samples air-annealed at 410C (oxygen- Fig. 2. Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) Kubelka-Munk spectra of as received 125 nm diamond nanoparticles and diamond nanoparticles after different treatments shows an estimated band alignment for diamond nanoparticles in the absence of illumination.Since diamond's valence band lies below the Fermi energy, when excess holes are present the (SO 3 2-) ions can donate electrons into the valence band to re-establish charge neutrality at the interface.While in principle SO 4 2-can also act as an electron acceptor, the rate of reaction of solvated electrons with CO 2 is 10 4 times faster than the reaction with sulfate or sulfite.Since UV light at wavelengths 225 nm is used in our experiments, the ions in solution must be as UV-transparent as possible.Sulfate ions do not absorb at wavelengths of 225 nm or longer 34.Comparative to other sacrificial oxidant such as I -, sulfite is more transparent in this UV range, leading to less absorption of ultraviolet light by the ions in the solution 2.

Size distribution by dynamic light scattering (DLS) for newly made diamond solution, diamond solutions after CO 2 photoreduction and after different control experiments S C R I P Taggregation and also eliminates the ability to reduce CO 2 .The fact that aggregation is observed only when CO 2 , light, and SO 3 2-are all present simultaneously strongly suggests that the aggregation is directly associated with the overall photochemical CO 2 reduction process.Previous studies have shown that H-terminated diamond nanoparticles with 5 nm diameter are stable when suspended in water that is in equilibrium with air and develop a highly positive zeta potential19 consistent with our observations for our starting materials in pure water.While it is not feasible to measure the zeta potential for our samples under our reaction conditions due to the high CO 2 pressures used (350 psi),prior studies showed that UV illumination of bulk diamond samples immersed in N 2saturated water induced oxidation over a period of several hours.Since every electron emission event must be accompanied by an oxidation reaction in order to maintain charge neutrality, one possibility is for oxidation to arise from interaction of valence-band holes with species such residual dissolved O 2 , OH -ions, or liquid H 2 O.

    "content": "Previous studies have shown that facile electron emission and photocatalytic activity of planar diamond samples are not achieved on oxidized samples, and that it is necessary to terminate the surface with hydrogen 234520 or with protonated amino groups 20.These surface terminations are essential because they provide a electrostatic potentials at the very surface that allow electrons in the bulk conduction band to escape into the adjacent medium with little or no barrier 34520.Figure 2 demonstrates the successful preparation of H-terminated diamond nanoparticles, using Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform Spectroscopy (DRIFTS) to characterize the infrared spectra after different annealing conditions.Additional characterization of the 125 nm diameter diamond particles via scanning electron microscopy and by Raman spectroscopy are shown in Supplemental Information Fig. S1.In the DRIFTS spectra of Figure 2, three regions are labeled: C-H stretching vibration region (2980 -2800 cm -1 ) 21222324, CO stretching vibration region (1950 -1630 cm -1 ) 212223 and a more complex region (1500 -900 cm -1 ) that contains features from several vibrational modes including C-O stretching (1200 -1000 cm -1 ) 25, C-C stretching(band around 1330 cm -1 ) 21, O-H deformation (1440 -1260 cm - 1 ) 25, and C-H deformation (1470 -1260 cm -1 ) 22,25.The as-received sample shows peaks at 1092 and 1735 cm -1 .After annealing in air at 410C, the CO stretching vibration region increases in intensity and shifts to 1808 cm -1 , and new prominent peaks appear at 1485 cm -1 , 1320 cm -1 and 1109 cm -1 .The shift in CO frequency from 1735 cm -1 to 1800 cm -1 shows a transition in carbonyl groups from ketones, aldehydes, and esters to acids, anhydrides or cyclic ketones 18.After the diamond sample is annealed in H 2 at 750C, an intense peak at 2833 cm -1 appears along with a shoulder near 2850 cm -1 and a broad feature near 2940 cm -1 .The sharp 2833 cm -1 peak is identical to that reported for the single C-H stretching mode of H-terminated diamond (111) 26, while the 2850 cm -1 and 2940 cm - shown that hydrogen termination of diamond leads to a positive value of 40 mV at acidic and neutral pH values 19,27, while oxygen termination leads to negative values of -40 mV when measured at pH 5 27.Thus, we conclude that the procedures we followed were effective at H-terminating the diamond surfaces.) anion has been shown previously to be an effective electron donor (hole scavenger) at other solid-electrolyte interfaces 28 and has a redox potential suitable for use with diamond 29.Secondly, a mixture containing both Na 2 SO 4 and Na 2 SO 3 creates an electrochemical buffer that fixes the electrochemical potential of the diamond surface 30.Based on the half-reaction reaction 4 2- 2 - 2 3 2- 2 -, E o -0.93 V vs SHE 29, and using pH3.2 for the pH of water saturated with CO 2 at a pressure of 350 psi (or 2.5 MPa) 31, the potential of the solution in contact with the diamond nanoparticles is fixed at a value of E -0.30V vs SHE.This also represents the potential of the diamond nanoparticle Fermi level after equilibration with the solution.The potential of -0.30V vs. SHE is approximately 0.5 V more negative than that reported for diamond in contact with air-saturated water 30.As discussed below, this negative potential helps to ensure downward band-bending at the diamond-electrolyte interface instead of the upward band-bending reported for diamond in contact with O 2 -saturated water 30,32,33. Previous studies of undoped diamond samples have typically reported bulk valence band positions approximately 0.9 eV below E F 32.Fig. 3 To evaluate the ability of the Hterminated diamond nanoparticle to initiate CO 2 reduction, the diamond dispersion was placed into a UV-grade fused silica cell that was placed inside a custom-built high-pressure vessel with a 0.5 cm 2 fused silica window for illumination.Figure S3 (Supplementary Information) shows the experimental apparatus.The high-pressure vessel was then purged and pressurized with CO 2 to 350 psi and the diamond solution was illuminated with ultraviolet light from a broadband HgXe lamp for 16 hours.Gas-phase products were then released into a custom-built FTIR transmission cell and analyzed via FTIR at 1 atmosphere pressure. Figure 4 shows FTIR spectra of the gas-phase headspace after illuminating diamond nanoparticles in in CO 2 -saturated water (350 psi pressure) for 16 hours, along with similar spectra for control experiments. The spectrum is resolved into a series of sharp features corresponding to individual rotational-vibrational transitions.Unreacted CO 2 gives rise to a series of lines extending from 2080 cm -1 to 2130 cm -1 .The CO product gives rise to two rotational-vibrational branches: the P branch (2140 cm -1 to 2090 cm -1 ) and shows little or no production of CO.A small amount of CO is produced from the \"No diamond\" and \"No electron donor\" sample; this arises from the fact that CO 2 has a small amount of intrinsic photochemical activity at short wavelengths 36. Importantly, the \"No diamond\" and \"No electron donor\" both show the same low level of reactivity; this confirms that the sulfite anion does not have any photochemical activity of its own under the conditions of our experiment.We calibrated our experimental apparatus to establish the absolute CO yield, obtaining 120 g.This is slightly smaller than the value of 300 g we reported previously using a solid borondoped diamond substrate 6.While there are many differences between samples, the similarity in overall yield suggests that the reaction kinetics on planar surfaces and nanoparticles may be similar. .Also shown are results from four different control samples each eliminating one of the following: the SO 3 2-electron donor, the diamond nanoparticles, the UV illumination, and the CO 2 . Distribution of reaction products.To determine whether other reaction products are present in significant quantities, we used 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to search for methanol, formic acid, and other possible products.We were not able to detect any other products in the liquid phase at the signal-to-noise limit of the instrument even with repeated signal-averaging.By making standards with known concentrations, we determined that the detection limit for possible products of interest (such as methanol and formic acid) is 0.5 mg/L (corresponding to 40 g of products in the volume of solution used in our experiments).This compares with 120 g of gas-phase CO observed.Based on the solutionphase detection limit, we conclude that CO must be 75 of the total reaction product, although we cannot rule out smaller amounts of other products. To determine whether the ability of diamond nanoparticles to initiate photochemical reduction of CO 2 depends on the nature of the diamond, we performed comparison experiments using H-terminated particles of detonation nanodiamond 17,37 having an average diameter of 6 nm. Figure S6 (Supplementary Information) shows representative DRIFTS spectra for detonation nanodiamond before and after H-termination.H-termination produces C-H stretching modes at 2882 and 2946 cm -1 characteristic of the asymmetric and symmetric stretching modes of surface CH 2 groups, but lacking the sharp feature at 2833 cm -1 associated with H-termination of the (111) crystal face.These samples yielded a large, positive zeta potential of 48.41.9 mV, establishing successful H-termination of the surfaces 19.When this nanodiamond was used in a manner equivalent to the experiments described above, we did not observe any significant production of CO.Fig. S7 in Supplementary Information shows the FTIR spectrum of the head-space after illumination with UV light under conditions identical to those used with the larger diamond nanoparticles.While illumination of detonation nanodiamond in the CO 2 Na 2 SO 3 Na 2 SO 4 solution produces a very small amount of CO, the amount does not rise above the baseline level of what is produced by direct photodissociation of CO 2 . Influence of illumination on diamond nanoparticles.In previous work we showed that bulk diamond immersed in water loses its surface H-termination after extensive exposure to deep UV light, and that this leads to a decrease in the ability to emit electrons and/or to induce photo-reduction reactions 2,7.In order to understand how illumination conditions affect surface termination of H-terminated diamond nanoparticles, we performed dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements for solutions before and after different photochemical reduction conditions.Figure 5 and this solution was pressurized with Ar and then illuminated.The \"No CO 2 control\" shows some aggregation to approximately 270 nm, but this aggregation is still substantially less than that observed when CO 2 , UV light, and the Na 2 SO 3 /Na 2 SO 4 are all present simultaneously. The present work shows four important results.First, the data in Fig. 4 show that H-terminated diamond nanoparticles of 125 nm diameter can induce photochemical reduction of CO 2 to CO when illuminated with UV light.Secondly, the control experiments show that CO is only produced in significant quantities when UV light, CO 2 , and the SO 3 2-sacrificial electron donor are present simultaneously.Third, that the major product of CO 2 reduction is CO, with all other products below the detection limits established by NMR.Finally, while the H-termination of diamond nanoparticles is eventually degraded leading to aggregation of the nanoparticles, this degradation is not significant unless CO 2 , UV light, and the SO 3 2-electron donor are present simultaneously. The present results are consistent with results we reported previously on planar diamond 2,6, and clarify seemingly disparate results obtained using detonation nanodiamond 7.In our earlier work using planar diamond 6, we showed that H-termination of planar diamond induces negative electron affinity and allows electrons excited to diamond's conduction band to be emitted into water with little or no barrier, forming solvated electrons.Solvated electrons then react rapidly with CO 2 at the pressures used here to produce the radical anion CO 2 - , which is photochemically active and dissociates to produce CO and the atomic oxygen anion, O - 38.However, when we attempted to extend that work to 5-6 nm \"detonation\" nanodiamond, we found that illumination under argon-purged conditions (with no CO 2 present) produced significant amounts of CO 7.On that basis we concluded that when using detonation nanodiamond, a significant amount of the CO comes from oxidation of the nanodiamond, rather than from reduction of CO 2 7.Similarly, in the present work we again find that detonation nanodiamond is not an effective catalyst, yielding no significant amount of CO compared to the control experiments.In A N U S C R I P T fact, in the present work we find that detonation nanodiamond in contact with CO 2 at 25 atmospheres pressure yields approximately the same amount of CO as we observed previously 6 with the same material with CO 2 at 1 atmosphere pressure.The fact that the yield of CO from DND does not depend on the pressure of CO 2 in the reaction vessel further supports the idea that illuminated detonation nanodiamond produces CO primarily by oxidation of the diamond particles.In contrast, using higher quality natural diamond nanoparticles yields much more positive results as demonstrated in Figure 4. We believe the dramatic difference in behavior between natural diamond nanoparticles reported here and detonation nanodiamond(DND) reported previously arises from several factors.First, we consider the crystallinity of the materials.The natural diamond samples we use here exhibit well-defined facets in SEM (Supplemental Information Fig. S1a), and a sharp 1332 cm -1 peak in Raman (Supp.Inf. Figure S1b), suggesting that the surface and bulk are both well-ordered with high crystallinity.Furthermore, the FTIR data (Figure 3) show a sharp vibrational mode characteristic of the C-H bond on diamond (111) samples. Taken together, the XRD, SEM, Raman, and FTIR data all indicate that the natural diamond nanoparticles are well ordered both in the bulk and at their surfaces.In contrast, the DND sample shows poor Raman characteristics (Figure S1, Supplementary information) and has been shown previously to have a high concentration of surface defects and possibly incomplete H-termination 39,40.We propose that the large amounts of under-coordinated C atoms of DND likely have higher reactivity and are more easily removed from the lattice compared with the C atoms within well-structured (111) planes that predominate with natural diamond nanoparticles.Thus, our data suggest that high crystalline perfection may be important in achieving good photochemical reduction without reaction of the diamond core. While natural diamond exhibit improved photocatalytic properties compared with detonation diamond, the DLS data in Fig. 5 show that even the high-quality natural diamond particles aggregate.However, it is important that aggregation is much more substantial under conditions where CO 2 reduction is most efficient -i.e., illumination in the presence of CO 2 with SO 3 However, the valence band is relatively shallow and is diamond has a high overpotential for water oxidation 33.Direct oxidation of diamond itself via C H 2 O CO 2H 2e -is unlikely because the standard reduction potential for the reverse reaction CO 2H 2e - C H 2 O is 0.518V vs. SHE, which translates to a formal potential of 0.329 V vs. SHE at pH3.2.Since the valence band of Hterminated diamond has been independently determined to be near 0 V vs. SHE 33, we conclude that oxidation of C with H 2 O would present a barrier of 0.5 eV per electron or 1 eV per C atom.We believe the key piece of evidence is that diamond aggregation does not occur unless the hole scavenger SO 3 2-is present.Based on this, we believe that diamond oxidation and aggregation are likely induced by reactive oxygen species produced from the reduction of CO 2 .The presence of a hole scavenger (electron then photodissociates in the presence of UV light to produce CO and the atomic oxygen anion, O - 38. Prior studies have shown that O is able to rapidly abstract H from alkanes 41.Alternatively, O could react with H in solution to produce the hydroxyl radical OH 42, which is also known to effectively abstract H atoms from alkanes 43.We believe it likely that any reactant able to abstract H from an alkane is likely to be able to do so from H-terminated diamond surfaces.Once H is abstracted from diamond, the resulting \"dangling bond\" is expected to be highly reactive and able to react with water to form various surface oxidation products.Thus, our data supports the overall series of reaction steps indicated in Figure 6. Reduction of CO 2 to CO has also been reported electrochemically, frequently using Cu metal as an electrode material44-48 or using Cu-modified diamond.48 In these studies, Cu is used because it provides a high overpotential for H reduction to H 2 and is sufficiently reactive to locally concentrate surface hydrogen atoms and various CO 2 reduction intermediates.However, this ability also results in various surface C-C coupling reactions and wide range of resulting products.In contrast, reduction in homogenous solution initiated by direct photoelectron injection leads almost entirely to CO due to the vastly different mechanisms.One the diamond surface there are few (if any) labile H atoms, and neither the reactants nor the products of CO 2 reduction have any significant tendency to bind to the surface, thereby drastically reducing the propensity to initiate C-C coupling reactions Thus, the UV-illuminated Hterminated diamond surface can act as a nearly inert source of electrons to directly and selectively reduce CO 2 to CO."

Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) Kubelka-Munk spectra of as received 125 nm diamond nanoparticles and diamond nanoparticles after different treatments shows an estimated band alignment for diamond nanoparticles in the absence of illumination.Since diamond's valence band lies below the Fermi energy, when excess holes are present the (SO 3 2-) ions can donate electrons into the valence band to re-establish charge neutrality at the interface.While in principle SO 4 2-can also act as an electron acceptor, the rate of reaction of solvated electrons with CO 2 is 10 4 times faster than the reaction with sulfate or sulfite.Since UV light at wavelengths 225 nm is used in our experiments, the ions in solution must be as UV-transparent as possible.Sulfate ions do not absorb at wavelengths of 225 nm or longer 34.Comparative to other sacrificial oxidant such as I -, sulfite is more transparent in this UV range, leading to less absorption of ultraviolet light by the ions in the solution 2.
