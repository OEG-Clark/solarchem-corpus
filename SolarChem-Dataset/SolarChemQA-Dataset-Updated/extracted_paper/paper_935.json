The syntheses of NiP-TPE-COF and CoP-TPE-COF were carried out using the same procedures as that of H 2 P-TPE-COF except H 2 TAP was replaced by NiTAP (14.7 mg, 0.02 mmol) and CoTAP (14.7 mg, 0.02 mmol), respectively."

    "content": "H 2 P-TPE-COF and NiP-TPE-COF were synthesized by acidcatalyzed Schiff-base reaction of H 2 TAP and metallized NiTAP with TPE, respectively (Figure 1(a)).Their crystal structures were defined by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) measurements in conjunction with structural simulations.In the PXRD pattern of H 2 P-TPE-COF (Figure S1, Supporting Information online), two diffraction peaks at 5.3and 10.9a re indexed to (110) and (220) crystal facets, respectively.The peaks in NiP-TPE-COF are shifted to 5.4and 11.2, respectively (Figure 1(b)).The structural models were constructed using the Materials Studio software package.The experimental PXRD patterns (black) in both NiP-TPE-COF and H 2 P-TPE-COF match well with the simulated AA stacking model (blue) in terms of peak positions and relative intensities, while significant difference is observed when compared with that of the AB stacking model (orange).The top and side views show that they feature two-dimensional rhombus framework (Figure 1(c), and Figure S2) and crystallize in the orthorhombic space group of P222 (Tables S1-S6, Supporting Information online).The Pawley refinements provide the following unit cell parameters with good residual factors (a22.7001A, b24.1977A and c5.8121A, R wp 5.49 and R p 4.24 for H 2 P-TPE-COF; a21.8943A, b 23.6302 A and c5.5822A, R wp 10.36 and R p 7.37 for NiP-TPE-COF), indicative of the validity of the computational models 32.Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), solidstate 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance ( 13 C NMR) spectra and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were used to confirm chemical structures of NiP-TPE-COF and H 2 P-TPE-COF.In their FTIR spectra (Figure 2(a)), both the carbonyl peak of TPE (1695 cm -1 ) and the N-H stretching bands of H 2 TAP/NiTAP (3,100-3,400 cm -1 ) are greatly attenuated, concomitant appearance of CN stretching vibration peak at 1,626 cm -1 indicates the formation of NiP-TPE-COF and H 2 P-TPE-COF, which is further evidenced by their solid-state 13 C NMR spectra.The characteristic signal of CN bond occurs at 158.8 ppm, other peaks in the range of 108-154 ppm are assigned to the aromatic carbon atoms (Figure S3) 33.XPS survey spectrum of NiP-TPE-COF shows the existence of C, O, N and Ni elements (Figure S4).In the high-resolution N 1s XPS spectrum of H 2 P-TPE-COF (Figure S5), the binding energy peaks at 398.02, 399.93 and 399.04 eV correspond to iminic, pyrrolic and imine nitrogen atoms, respectively.In contrast, only two prominent nitrogen signals at 398.64 and 399.04 eV are identified in NiP-TPE-COF owing to the same chemical environment of porphyrinic nitrogen atoms 31.The deconvoluted Ni 2p XPS spectrum provides two binding en-ergy peaks at 855.34 and 872.39 eV (Figure S6), suggesting divalent state of metal ion in NiP-TPE-COF.Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images show that H 2 P-TPE-COF and NiP-TPE-COF possess similar morphology, which are assembled by bulky aggregates consisting of granular particles (Figure S7).Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mappings corroborate homogeneous distribution of C, N and Ni elements over NiP-TPE-COF (Figure S8).In the solidstate ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis) diffuse reflectance spectra, both H 2 P-TPE-COF and NiP-TPE-COF show typical four Q-bands, but an obvious blue shift is observed for NiP-TPE-COF owing to the metalation of porphyrin units (Figure S9).The Ni content in NiP-TPE-COF was determined to be 5.1 wt by inductively coupled plasma atom emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) analyses.The thermal stabilities of H 2 P-TPE-COF and NiP-TPE-COF were measured by thermogravimetric analysis, which are stable before 350 C under N 2 atmosphere (Figure S10).The permanent porosities of H 2 P-TPE-COF and NiP-TPE-COF were evaluated by N 2 physisorption at 77 K (Figure 2 (b)).The rapid nitrogen uptake at very low relative pressure shows typical characteristic of micropore.The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface areas for H 2 P-TPE-COF and NiP-TPE-COF are 683 and 1,154 m 2 g -1 , respectively.The total pore volumes are 0.48 and 0.70 cm 3 g -1 , respectively.The pore size distributions exhibit that their main pores are centered at 1.15 nm (Figure S11), which are close to the theoretical pores for the simulated AA stacking structure, but is much larger than those in AB model (Tables S1 andS4), which further validates their crystalline structure. The CO 2 sorption properties of H 2 P-TPE-COF and NiP-TPE-COF were investigated to identify the role of incorporated metal ions.The CO 2 adsorption capacities in H , respectively (Figure S13), which indicates that CO 2 sorption is mainly physisorption.In situ FTIR spectrum of molecular CO 2 exhibits a typical asymmetric stretching band at 2,335 cm -1 (Figure 2(c)).The introduction of NiP-TPE-COF induces the occurrence of a new adsorption peak at 2,364 cm -1 owing to the electron donation from the oxygen lone pairs of CO 2 to the unoccupied Ni II orbitals 35.Notably, the vibration peaks are still observed after the release of CO 2 , indicating strong interactions of the adsorbed CO 2 molecules with NiP-TPE-COF.As total results, the incorporation of Ni ions in NiP-TPE-COF enhances CO 2 adsorption capacity, CO 2 selectivity over N 2 and CO 2 affinity, which are favorable for CO 2 catalytic conversion 36. The application of NiP-TPE-COF in photocatalytic CO , respectively, corresponding to the selectivity of CO evolution over H 2 generation as high as 93.No other reaction byproducts, such as HCOOH, and CH 3 OH, are detected (Figure S14).Notably, the photocatalytic system is also effective for low concentration of CO 2 at 0.1 atm, a typical CO 2 concentration of the exhaust gas from coal-fired power stations.When the simulated flue gas consisting of 10 CO 2 and 90 N 2 was used to replace pure CO 2 , CO evolution rate and selectivity over H 2 generation are 386 mol g -1 h -1 and 77, respectively (Figure S15).The photocatalytic activity and selectivity are comparable with those in the reported visible-light-driven catalytic systems Tables S7 andS8).As comparison, COF-366-Ni and COF-367-Ni with similar morphology were also prepared through Schiff-based reaction of NiTAP with 1,4benzenedicarboxaldehyde and 4,4-biphenyldialdehyde, respectively (Figure S16) 38.The CO evolution rates in 2 h for COF-366-Ni and COF-367-Ni decrease to 78 and 110 mol g , respecitvely, their selectivities over H 2 generation are 26 and 53, respectively (Figure S17).Higher catalytic activity of NiP-TPE-COF is mainly attributed to stronger conjugation ability than that of COF-366/ 367-Ni.The cyclic voltammogram (CV) and optical tests of TPE and NiTAP have validated the integration of the electron-donating TPE and electron-accepting NiTAP in NiP-TPE-COF (Figures S18 andS19), the electron donoracceptor dyad is favorable for transfer of the photogenerated electrons from TPE to Ni-TAP 394041. To identify the role of NiP-TPE-COF in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, a series of control experiments were carried out (Figure 3(b,c)).When NiP-TPE-COF was replaced by H 2 P-TPE-COF or in the absence of NiP-TPE-COF under the identical conditions, negligible CO was generated.Direct use of free Ni 2 ions afforded the CO evolution amount of 266 mol g -1 in 2 h, which was increased to 347 mol g -1 when the physical mixture of H 2 P-TPE-COF and free Ni 2 ions was used.Notably, ICP-AES analysis shows that the Ni content in the isolated solid is negligible after photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.These observations reveal that Ni serves as the active sites, and the presence of H 2 P-TPE-COF could facilitate CO 2 photoreduction, but NiP-TPE-COF could not be formed in situ during photocatalytic reaction.The photocatalytic system is inactive in the absence of Ru(bpy) 3 -Cl 2 , TEOA or light irradiation.When N 2 was used to replace CO 2 , only a small amount of H 2 is produced, and no CO evolution is detected, which suggests that CO originates from CO 2 molecules, rather than other organic species in the photocatalytic system.The observation has been further evidenced by the isotropic experiments under the same conditions.The gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of the evolved gases only exhibits the peak of 13 CO (m/z29) when 13 CO 2 is used as the gas source (Figure S20). NiP-TPE-COF possesses superior structural robustness and durability, no apparent variations in both catalytic activity and selectivity were observed after NiP-TPE-COF was used at least four times (Figure 3(d)).The recovered NiP-TPE-COF (NiP-TPE-COF-4run) was also investigated.SEM image, PXRD pattern, FTIR and XPS spectra of NiP-TPE-COF-4run are almost identical with those of as-synthesized NiP-TPE-COF (Figures S21-S23).The hot filtration experiment has validated heterogeneous behavior of NiP-TPE-COF in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction (Figure 3(a)). To establish the ideal platforms for better understanding CO 2 photoreduction, Co ion with one d-orbital electron less than Ni ion was also introduced into H 2 P-TPE-COF to form isostructural CoP-TPE-COF counterpart with the same morphology (Figures S24,S25, and Tables S9-S11).When photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was conducted using CoP-TPE-COF as the catalyst under the same conditions, CoP-TPE-COF shows much higher catalytic activity than NiP-TPE-COF.The evolution amounts of CO 2 and H 2 in 2 h are 4,828 and 3,080 mol g -1 , respectively, but the selectivity is as low as 61 (Figure 3(b)).The results show that the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction is dependent on metalloporphyrin units in MP-TPE-COF.The metallization of Co significantly improves catalytic activity, while the metallization of Ni is responsible for high CO 2 -to-CO selectivity. To get insight into the roles of MP-TPE-COF in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, the photoelectronical measurements were carried out.The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements show that the semicycle arc radius of Nyquist plot in CoP-TPE-COF is smaller than that of NiP-TPE-COF (Figure S26), which suggests that more rapid interfacial charge transfer in CoP-TPE-COF 23,40.The steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectrum of the reaction system without catalysts shows a strong and broad band at 620 nm upon irradiation at 500 nm (Figure 4 , respectively, showing that CoP-TPE-COF has stronger affinity for CO 2 .Moreover, CO 2 exhibits a bent configuration after interacting with MP-TPE-COF (Figure S29).The Co-C bond distance of 2.035 A on CoP-TPE-COF is shorter than that of the Ni-C bond (2.122 A), which further confirms stronger binding interactions between CO 2 and Co species 39,42.Thus, CoP-TPE-COF exhibits superior catalytic activity over NiP-TPE-COF, which is further confirmed by the process of CO desorption to form free CO molecules."

    "content": "The metalloporphyrin-based COFs consisting of electron donor-acceptor dyads have been constructed for understanding CO 2 photoreduction at molecular level.The relatively large surface area and periodic incorporation of metalloporphyrin units are conducive to the adsorption and activation of CO 2 molecules, while smooth electron transfer from photosensitizer to metalloporphyrin active sites facilitates CO 2 -to-CO conversion under visible-light irradiation.Both NiP-TPE-COF and CoP-TPE-COF exhibit high efficiency with superior durability.The activation of CO 2 molecules and rapid transfer of photogenerated electrons are responsible for high catalytic activity, while the selectivity of CO 2 photoreduction is directly related to the competitive reaction of the protons.This work provides molecular-level insights into the mechanism of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, which could be extended to various COFs-based catalytic materials for solar energy conversion and other applications. 2 P-TPE-COF at 295 and 273 K are 1.4 and 2.3 mmol g -1 , respectively.which are increased to 1.6 and 2.7 mmol g -1 in NiP-TPE-COF, respectively (Figure 2(d), and Figure S12), which shows that the existence of Ni increase the CO 2 adsorption ability owing to Lewis acid-base interactions between the adsorbed CO 2 molecules and Ni ions 34.The adsorption selectivities of CO 2 toward N 2 at 273 K for H 2 P-TPE-COF and NiP-TPE-COF are 21.0 and 22.5, respectively.The isosteric heat of adsorption (Q st ) at zero coverage of H 2 P-TPE-COF and NiP-TPE-COF are 20.1 and 20.9 kJ mol -1 Figure 1 (a) Schematic depiction for the synthesis of MP-TPE-COF; (b) PXRD patterns of NiP-TPE-COF; (c) top and side views for AA-stacking mode of NiP-TPE-COF (color online).

(a)).The introduction of MP-TPE-COF has significantly declined PL intensities.Moreover, PL signal gradually attenuates with the rise of the NiP-TPE-COF contents (FigureS27), which indicates the electron transfer from the excited Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 to NiP-TPE-COF31.It should be mentioned that CoP-TPE-COF shows lower charge transfer resistance and weaker PL intensity than NiP-TPE-COF, which well explains their photocatalytic activity.The time-resolved PL decay spectroscopy shows that the PL lifetime is decreased from 274 to 245 and 236 ns after the addition of NiP-TPE-COF and CoP-TPE-COF, respectively (FigureS28).Thus, MP-TPE-COF could effectively suppress the recombination of photogenerated charge carriers and facilitate the electron migration by the extended -conjugated framework, thereby markedly promoting the reduction of the adsorbed CO 2 molecules to CO.To better understand metalloporphyrin-dependent selectivity and activity for CO 2 photoreduction, density functional theory (DFT) calculations for whole catalytic process have been performed based on the carboxyl intermediate step.As shown in Figure 4(b), the calculated Gibbs free energies (G) for the formation of the CO 2 -CoP-TPE-COF and CO 2 -NiP-TPE-COF adducts are -38.97 and -23.58 kcal mol -1 For H 2 generation (Figure 4(c)), the G barrier corresponding to the reduction of the adsorbed water to H transition state for NiP-TPE-COF (18.1 kcal mol -1 ) is higher than that of CoP-TPE-COF (1.92 kcal mol -1 ), revealing that CoP-TPE-COF is more active than NiP-TPE-COF.In addition, G of the protonelectron transfer reduction process (CO 2 H e - COOH, COOHH e - COH 2 O) for CoP-TPE-COFis lower than that for NiP-TPE-COF, suggesting that NiP-TPE-COF is more inclined to get protons for the evolution of CO and inhibition of H 2 generation.Thus, CoP-TPE-COF exhibits higher catalytic activity than NiP-TPE-COF, but the selectivity for CO production is lower than NiP-TPE-COF, which are agreement with the experimental results.Based on the aforementioned observations, a plausible mechanism for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction over NiP-TPE-COF has been proposed (Figure4(d)).Upon visible-light irradiation, the photogenerated electrons are transferred from the photosensitizer to Ni II P-TPE-COF, resulting in the formation of Ni 0 P-TPE-COF.The CO 2 molecules are adsorbed and activated by the Ni 0 active sites, subsequent protonation generates the COOH-Ni II P-TPE-COF 2-intermediate.After the intermediate undergoes further protonation and the removal of water molecule, the conversion process of CO 2 to CO is completed with the release of CO and the regenaration of Ni II P-TPE-COF.
