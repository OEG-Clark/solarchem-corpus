    "content": "In this work, SnS-SnS 2 heterostructured upright nanosheet frameworks are constructed on FTO substrates, which demonstrate promising photocatalytic performances for the conversion of CO 2 and water to C2 (acetaldehyde) and C3 (acetone) hydrocarbons without H 2 formation.With post annealing in designated atmospheres, the photocatalytic activity of the SnS-SnS 2 heterostructured nanosheet framework is critically enhanced by increasing the fraction of crystalline SnS in nanosheets through partial transformation of the SnS 2 matrix to SnS but not obviously influenced by improving the crystallinity of the SnS 2 matrix.DFT calculations indicate that transformed SnS possesses the CO 2 adsorption sites with significantly lower activation energy for the rate-determining step to drive efficient CO 2 conversion catalysis.The experimental results and DFT calculations suggest that the SnS-SnS 2 heterojunction nanosheet framework photocatalyst experiences Z-scheme charge transfer dynamic to allow the water oxidation and CO 2 reduction reactions occurring on the surfaces of SnS 2 and SnS, respectively.The Z-scheme SnS-SnS 2 heterostructured nanosheet framework photocatalyst exhibits not only efficient charge separation but also highly catalytic active sites to boost the photocatalytic activity for CO 2 conversion to C2 and C3 hydrocarbons."

    "content": "Preparation of Photocatalysts.The seed layer composed of SnO 2 NPs was prepared on FTO substrates by spin-coating of a commercial SnO 2 colloidal dispersion liquid (15 in H 2 O) followed by heat treatment at 300 C for 1.5 h.SnS 2 -based nanosheet frameworks were grown on the seeded FTO substrates using a solvothermal method in 40 mL of triethylene glycol solution of 0.5 mmol of SnCl 2 and 2.6 mmol of thioacetamide at 220 C for 1 h.The pristine nanosheet frameworks were further annealed at 260 C in an Ar atmosphere or in the presence of sulfur vapor for 30 min. Characterizations of Photocatalysts.Morphologies of the nanosheet frameworks were inspected using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Hitachi SU 8010).The chemical states of the nanosheet frameworks were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Scientific K-Alpha) equipped with a charge neutralizer.Structural characterizations of the nanosheet frameworks were conducted using a 2D X-ray diffractometer (D8 Discover with GADDS, Bruker), a powder X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Rigaku D/MAX-2000), and a transmission electron microscope (TEM) (FEI E.O Tecnai F20 G2MAT S-TWIN).Optical absorptions of the nanosheet frameworks were measured using an ultraviolet-visible-infrared (UV-vis-IR) spectrophotometer (JASCO V-670) with an integrating sphere assembly. Photocatalytic Conversion of CO 2 .Photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 (99.9999) over the nanosheet framework photocatalysts was conducted at room temperature for 10 h in a gaseous system with a pressure of 1 atm in the presence of H 2 O vapor under AM 1.5 G simulated sunlight at 100 mW cm -2 (100 W, Model 94011A, Oriel).The gas products were analyzed using gas chromatography (GC, Shimadzu, Tracera, GC-2010 Plus) equipped with a barrier ionization discharge (BID) detector and a flame ionization detector (FID). Computational Methods.Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction calculations on SnS 2 and SnS were performed by the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) 38 based on DFT.The interaction between the core ion and valence electron was described by a projector augmented wave (PAW) method. 39The Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof exchange functional of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) was used for the exchange-correlation function. 40A conjugate gradient algorithm method was adopted for ground-state structural optimization.The energy cutoff for the plane wave was set to 340 eV.To understand the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity, 3 3 2 and 3 1 3 supercells for SnS 2 (001) and SnS(010) surfaces have been viewed as the reaction surfaces, respectively.The energy convergence criterion of the gas adsorption process was less than 10 -4 eV.All systems were relaxed separately until the force criterion acting on each atom was less than 0.02 eV/A.The periodic replicas were kept away from each other with a vacuum at least 12 A along the z direction."

    "content": "Morphology and Structural Properties.The SnS 2 -based nanosheet frameworks were grown on seeded FTO substrates using a solvothermal method.The pristine nanosheet frameworks were further annealed at 260 C in an Ar atmosphere.For comparison, the annealing of the pristine nanosheet frameworks was also conducted at the same temperature but in the presence of sulfur vapor.Figure 1a and Figure 1b show the top-view and cross-sectional view of the SEM images of the pristine nanosheet frameworks on the FTO substrate, respectively.Vertical nanosheets are uniformly formed on the FTO substrate, which is highly advantageous for gas-solid interaction.The average height of the nanosheets on the FTO substrate is 300 nm.After annealing in Ar gas and S vapor, the morphology of the nanosheet framework remains the same, as shown in Figure 1c and Figure 1d, respectively.For simplicity, the pristine, Ar-annealed, and S vapor-annealed nanosheet frameworks are named as p-NS, NS-Ar, and NS-S hereafter, respectively. Hydrothermal growth of the stacked SnS 2 nanoplates in aqueous solution was achieved using an aqueous solution of SnCl 4 and thiourea. 41It was suggested that SnO 2 NPs were the crucial intermediate species and transformed to SnS 2 nanoplates accompanied with the Ostwald ripening and heterogeneous nucleation processes. 41To challenge the growth of upright SnS 2 nanosheets on FTO substrates, in this work, a SnO 2 NP layer was precoated on FTO substrates as the seed layer for the solvothermal growth of SnS 2 nanosheets using the TEG solution of SnCl 2 and TAA.We suggested that SnO 2 NPs were converted to SnS 2 as the crystal seeds for the heterogeneous nucleation and growth of upright SnS 2 nanosheets on FTO substrates.Moreover, the solvothermal process is employed in this work to prevent from the formation of SnO 2 NPs in aqueous solution that will bring about the growth of stacked SnS 2 nanosheets. 41In this case, the precoated SnO 2 NPs on FTO are the sole nucleation sites for the heterogeneous growth of SnS 2 nanosheets, which will be beneficial to the formation of upright SnS 2 nanosheets on FTO substrates. The chemical states of the three nanosheet frameworks were characterized using XPS. Figure 2a-c shows the Sn 3d XPS spectra of p-NS, NS-Ar, and NS-S, respectively.The Sn 3d 5/2 and Sn 3d 3/2 XPS peaks of the three nanosheet frameworks can be deconvoluted to 4 subpeaks centered at binding energies of 485.7, 486.6, 494.1, and 495 eV, which correspond to those of Sn 2 3d 5/2 , Sn 4 3d 5/2 , Sn 2 3d 3/2 , and Sn 4 3d 3/2 , respectively. 42,43It is worth addressing that the Sn 2 3d 3/2 and Sn 2 3d 5/2 signals in the Sn 3d XPS spectrum of NS-Ar are apparently stronger as compared to those of p-NS and NS-S.Based on the Sn 3d XPS results in Figure 2a-c, the Sn 2 /Sn 4 ratios in the p-NS, NS-Ar, and NS-S are 0.05, 0.132, and 0.06, respectively.Moreover, the S 2p XPS spectra of p-NS, NS-Ar, and NS-S are illustrated in Figure 2d-f, respectively.The broad S 2p signal also can be deconvoluted into 4 components centered at binding energies of 160.5, 161.2, 161.7, and 162.8 eV, which pertained to those of S 2p 3/2 of SnS, S 2p 3/2 of SnS 2 , S 2p 1/2 of SnS, and S 2p 1/2 of SnS 2 , respectively. 43,44The SnS/ SnS 2 ratios in the p-NS, NS-Ar, and NS-S estimated from the S 2p spectra are 0.04, 0.138, and 0.056, respectively, which are very consistent with those obtained from the Sn 3d spectra.Accordingly, the fraction of SnS in NS-Ar is significantly increased, whereas the amount of SnS in NS-S remains almost the same as that in p-NS.The XPS analysis concludes that SnS is present in the pristine NS frameworks, and additional transformation of SnS 2 to SnS is achieved after the post annealing of the SnS 2 matrix in an Ar atmosphere. The XRD patterns integrated from the 2D X-ray diffraction frames of p-NS, NS-Ar, and NS-S and the FTO substrate are shown in Figure 3a.For comparison, the standard X-ray diffraction patterns of trigonal SnS 2 (ICDD-PDF 00-023-0677) and orthorhombic SnS (ICDD-PDF 00-039-0354) are also displayed.In addition to the diffraction peaks of FTO, the diffraction peak at 2 28.2corresponding to the (100) Obviously, the (001) diffraction peak of SnS 2 is more significant after annealing either in an Ar atmosphere or in the presence of S vapor.Figure 3b shows the XRD patterns of the three nanosheet frameworks and the FTO substrate in the 2 region of 20-40of Figure 3a.As illustrated in Figure 3b, the diffraction peak at 2 31.9appearsonly in the XRD pattern of NS-Ar.It matches with the (040) diffraction peak of SnS, which indicates the existence of the orthorhombic SnS phase in NS-Ar.Accordingly, the XRD analysis reveals that the vertical crystalline SnS-SnS 2 heterostructured nanosheets on the FTO substrate are obtained through the annealing of pristine nanosheet frameworks in an Ar atmosphere. Structural characterizations of p-NS, NS-Ar, and NS-S were further conducted using TEM. Figure 4a and the inset show the high-resolution (HR) TEM image and the corresponding selective area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of an individual nanosheet scratched from p-NS, respectively.The lattice spacings of 0.32 and 0.18 nm denoted in the HRTEM image of Figure 4a are consistent with the d-spacings of (100) and (110) crystal planes of SnS 2 , respectively.The diffraction rings pertained to the (100) and (110) diffractions of SnS 2 are also shown in the SAED pattern, which indicates that the nanosheet is composed of SnS 2 nanocrystals with a common zone axis 001.The halo SAED pattern also suggests that the atomic arrangement of SnS 2 is likely in short-range order only.The high-magnification HRTEM image of the nanosheet denoted in Figure 4a is further displayed in Figure 4b.This micrograph reveals several six-fold atomic rings (in dashed circles), which is consistent with the hexagonal lattice of SnS 2 on the (001) plane.Therefore, the HRTEM characterization indicates that the surface of the p-NS nanosheet is mainly composed of SnS 2 (001) crystal planes although the long-range ordering of lattice fringes is not well-exhibited.The missing of long-range ordered SnS 2 lattices is possibly due to the presence of a small fraction of amorphous SnS in the nanosheet, as resolved by XPS analysis shown in Figure 2. Figure 5a and Figure 5b show the HRTEM images and the corresponding SAED patterns (insets) of nanosheets scratched from NS-Ar and NS-S, respectively.After the post annealing at 260 C in an Ar atmosphere for 30 min, the lattice fringes and diffraction rings of SnS 2 (100) and (110) crystal planes are still observed in the HRTEM image and the SAED pattern, respectively, as displayed in Figure 5a.Nevertheless, the lattice spacings of 0.34 and 0.20 nm denoted in region (I) of Figure 5a correspond to the d-spacings of (120) and (002) crystal planes of SnS, respectively.The fast Fourier transform (FFT) on the region is illustrated in the inset of Figure 5a.The diffraction spots in the pattern are ascribed to (120) and (002) crystal planes of SnS, confirming the existence of the orthorhombic SnS phase in the NS-Ar nanosheet.Consequently, the HRTEM characterization is consistent with the XRD result that the formation of crystalline SnS-SnS 2 heterostructured nanosheets is achieved by the post annealing of the pristine nanosheet in an Ar atmosphere.As denoted in Figure 5b and the inset, well-defined lattice fringes and diffraction rings with discrete spots of SnS 2 (100) and (110) crystal planes are obtained in the HRTEM image and the corresponding SAED pattern of the NS-S nanosheet, respectively.Therefore, compared to the p-NS nanosheet where the lattices are mostly in short-range ordering (see Figure 4), the crystallinity of SnS 2 nanocrystals in the NS-S nanosheet is significantly enhanced after the post annealing at 260 C in S vapor for 30 min. Combining XPS, XRD, and TEM results, we suggest that the pristine nanosheet framework consists of amorphous SnSnanocrystalline SnS 2 heterostructured nanosheets vertically on the FTO substrate.After the post annealing in S vapor, the crystallinity of SnS 2 nanocrystals is improved; however, SnS remains amorphous and is of the same fraction in the NS-S framework.Notably, after post annealing the pristine nanosheet framework in an Ar atmosphere, SnS shows crystalline structure with an increased extent in the NS-Ar framework to form crystalline SnS-SnS 2 heterostructures through partial transformation of the SnS 2 matrix to SnS. Optical Properties and Photocatalytic Performances.The absorbance (1-total transmittance (T)-total reflection (R)) spectra and the corresponding Tauc plots of the three nanosheet frameworks are shown in Figure 6a and Figure 6b, respectively.The absorption edge of p-NS is at 520 nm, which corresponds to a direct band gap of 2.35 eV.After post annealing either in Ar or S vapor, the absorbances of the nanosheet frameworks at wavelengths ranging from 400 to 550 nm increase, and the band gaps of both NS-Ar and NS-S are redshifted to 2.25 eV.As characterized by HRTEM in Figures 4 and5, the redshift of the band gap is ascribed to the increase in the sizes of SnS 2 crystals in the nanosheet frameworks after the post annealing. Photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 through p-NS, NS-Ar, and NS-S photocatalysts was conducted in a gaseous system in the presence of H 2 O vapor under AM 1.5 G simulated sunlight at 100 mW cm -2 .The gas products were analyzed using GC equipped with a BID detector and an FID.Blank experiments reveal that there are no detectable hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and hydrocarbon species produced in the absence of CO 2 .The products obtained from the photocatalytic CO 2 conversion processes are acetaldehyde (CH 3 CHO) and acetone (CH 3 COCH 3 ) using the three SnS-SnS 2 heterostructured nanosheet framework photocatalysts.There is no H 2 detected during the 10 h measurements although formation of H 2 via proton reduction is a competition reaction of CO 2 photoconversion by using water as the hole scavenger.It indicates that the selectively of CO 2 photoconversion achieves 100 using the SnS-SnS 2 heterostructured nanosheet framework photocatalysts. The formation rates of acetaldehyde and acetone as well as the electron consumption rates over p-NS, NS-Ar, and NS-S are illustrated in Figure 7.The photocatalytic performances of these SnS-SnS 2 heterostructured nanosheet frameworks are also summarized in Table 1.The formation rates of acetaldehyde and acetone from the photocatalytic CO 2 conversion processes through p-NS are 9.4 and 10.0 mol g -1 h -1 , respectively.Considering that 10 electrons and 16 electrons are correspondingly needed for the formations of acetaldehyde and acetone, 16 the electron consumption rate is estimated to be 254 mol g -1 h -1 , and the selectivities for the products of acetaldehyde and acetone are 37.0 and 63.0, respectively, using the p-NS photocatalyst.Regarding the NS-S photocatalyst, the formation rates of acetaldehyde and acetone are 8.2 and 11.1 mol g -1 h -1 with the selectivities of 31.5 and 68.3, respectively.The overall electron consumption rate through NS-S for the photocatalytic CO 2 conversion is 260 mol g -1 h -1 .In the case of using the NS-Ar photocatalyst, the formation rates of acetaldehyde and acetone are significantly increased to 11.5 and 15.0 mol g -1 h -1 with the selectivities of 32.4 and 67.6, respectively.The electron consumption rate for photocatalytic CO 2 conversion over NS-Ar is 355 mol g -1 h -1 , which is 40 enhanced compared to that of the p-NS photocatalyst.The morphology and crystal structure of NS-Ar were further inspected after CO 2 photoconversion.As shown in Figure S2a,b, compared to the one before reaction, the upright feature of the nanosheet framework is well-retained after photocatalytic reaction.Moreover, the -2 X-ray powder diffraction patterns of NS-Ar before and after reaction illustrated in Figure S2c indicate that the crystalline SnS-SnS 2 heterostructure of the NS-Ar photocatalyst is preserved after 10 h photocatalytic reaction. The Roles of SnS 2 and SnS.The p-NS photocatalyst, which is composed of upright amorphous SnS-nanocrystalline SnS 2 heterostructured nanosheets, demonstrates rather distinctive photocatalytic activity for CO 2 conversion.The conversion of CO 2 and H 2 O to C2 (acetaldehyde) and C3 (acetone) hydrocarbons was achieved over p-NS.Moreover, the selectivity of CO 2 photoconversion reaches 100 owing to free H 2 formation.The selectivities of C2 and C3 hydrocarbons from photocatalytic CO 2 conversion over the three photocatalysts are rather similar.Compared to p-NS, only a minor increased selectivity (5) for acetone formation was attained with NS-Ar and NS-S photocatalysts.Nevertheless, the electron consumption rate for photocatalytic CO 2 conversion over NS-Ar is much higher than that over NS-S.The results indicate that the photocatalytic activity of the SnS-SnS 2 photocatalyst was further improved by increasing the ratio and crystallinity of SnS in the heterojunction nanosheets.DFT calculations were conducted to investigate the photocatalytic CO 2 conversion activities for the SnS 2 and SnS atomic layers.Since CO is the initial redox product for the photoconversion of CO 2 to hydrocarbons under gaseous conditions, 45 the photocatalytic CO 2 conversion activity primarily depends on the vital steps of reduction of CO 2 to CO. 19,26,46 The reaction steps for the conversion of CO 2 to CO on the surface of the catalyst in the presence of water have been proposed as follows 26 CO CO Based on the structural characterizations shown in Figures 345, the exposed surface of SnS 2 nanocrystals in the vertical nanosheets is the (001) crystal plane.On the other hand, the exposed surface of 2D SnS, which is transformed from SnS 2 by an annealing step in an Ar atmosphere, is the (010) plane (with the space group of Pbnm (62)). 37Moreover, the transformation of an orthorhombic SnS phase relies on the S depletion in original hexagonal SnS 2 . 37This process may also result in Sn vacancies in the transformed SnS structure.Therefore, in this work, DFT calculations were conducted on the aforementioned reaction steps over the S-deficient SnS 2 (001) and Sn-deficient SnS(010) planes. Figure 8a and Figure 8b respectively show the optimized structures of the S-deficient SnS 2 (001) and Sn-deficient SnS(010) atomic layers during the steps of reduction of CO 2 to CO.They reveal that CO 2 adsorbed on the SnS 2 (001) and SnS(010) planes in the vicinities of S and Sn vacancies, respectively, where the subsequent reactions occurred to produce adsorbed CO.The DFT-calculated energy change (comparative to the state before CO 2 adsorption) profiles of the reaction steps on the S-deficient SnS 2 (001) and Sndeficient SnS(010) planes are illustrated in Figure 8c.Compared to SnS(010), SnS 2 (001) possesses a relatively stable energy state in the step of CO 2 adsorption.As shown in Figure 8c, the formation of the COOH (ads) intermediate is the rate-determining step for the conversion of CO 2 to CO, and SnS(010) exhibits a lower activation energy for this ratedetermining step than SnS 2 (001) does.Accordingly, DFT calculations reflect that compared to original SnS 2 (001), transformed SnS(010) possesses the CO 2 adsorption sites with significantly lower activation energy for the rate-determining step to facilitate CO 2 conversion catalysis.Comparable catalytic activities for CO 2 photoconversion are obtained from the NS-S and p-NS photocatalysts although the crystallinity of SnS 2 is improved in NS-S.As enriching the ratio and crystallinity of SnS, the photocatalytic activity of NS-Ar is significantly enhanced in comparison with the p-NS photocatalyst, indicating that the SnS portion in the SnS-SnS 2 heterojunction nanosheet photocatalysts plays a crucial role in photoconversion of CO 2 to C2/C3 hydrocarbons.DFT calculations support the experimental results that SnS provides highly catalytic active sites for CO 2 photoconversion. The band diagram of the SnS-SnS 2 p-n heterojunction is illustrated in Figure 9. 36,47,48 A staggered band structure is constructed after the formation of the SnS-SnS 2 p-n heterojunction. 36,47It should be noted that the valence band edge of SnS in the heterojunction is higher than the water oxidation potential, 30,31,48 as shown in Figure 9. Hence, we suggest that the SnS-SnS 2 p-n heterojunction experiences Zscheme charge transfer dynamic 1,2,4,5 to perform the superior photocatalytic activity for CO 2 conversion.As the SnS-SnS 2 heterojunction is photoexcited, the photogenerated electrons in SnS 2 and holes in SnS respectively transfer to the interfacial region where the recombination occurs.The lifetimes of the photogenerated holes and electrons correspondingly remained in SnS 2 and SnS are therefore prolonged.It allows the water oxidation and CO 2 reduction reactions to take place on the surfaces of SnS 2 and SnS, respectively, as illustrated in Figure 9. Based on the DFT calculation results shown in Figure 8, transformed SnS lowers the activation energy of the ratedetermining step to enhance CO 2 photoconversion catalysis.Therefore, the Z-scheme SnS-SnS 2 heterostructured nanosheet framework photocatalyst not only promotes the charge separation but also provides highly catalytic active sites to boost the photocatalytic activity for CO 2 conversion."

    "content": "In this work, amorphous SnS-nanocrystalline SnS 2 heterostructured upright nanosheet frameworks have been grown on seeded FTO substrates using a solvothermal method.The morphology of nanosheet frameworks is well-preserved, while the fraction of crystalline SnS and the crystallinity of the SnS 2 matrix can be modified by post annealing of the pristine SnS-SnS 2 heterostructured nanosheet frameworks in an Ar atmosphere and sulfur vapor, respectively.The pristine SnS-SnS 2 heterostructured nanosheet framework demonstrates rather distinctive photocatalytic activity for CO 2 conversion, on which the conversion of CO 2 and H 2 O to C 2 (acetaldehyde) and C 3 (acetone) hydrocarbons was achieved without formation of H 2 under the irradiation of AM 1.5 G (100 mW cm -2 ) simulated sunlight.The photocatalytic activity of the SnS-SnS 2 heterostructured nanosheet framework is significantly improved by increasing the fraction of crystalline SnS in nanosheets but not obviously influenced by enhancing the crystallinity of the SnS 2 matrix.DFT calculations indicate that compared to the original SnS 2 matrix, transformed SnS possesses the CO 2 adsorption sites with significantly lower activation energy for the rate-determining step to govern CO 2 conversion catalysis.Combining the experimental results and DFT calculations, Z-scheme charge transfer dynamic is proposed to be present in the SnS-SnS 2 heterojunction nanosheet framework photocatalyst where the water oxidation and CO 2 reduction reactions are respectively catalyzed on the surfaces of SnS 2 and SnS.Accordingly, the Z-scheme SnS-SnS 2 heterostructured nanosheet framework photocatalyst provides not only efficient charge separation but also highly catalytic active sites to increase the photocatalytic activity for CO 2 conversion to C 2 and C 3 hydrocarbons. s Supporting Information The Supporting Information is available free of charge at https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsami.0c18420.X-ray powder diffraction pattern of p-NS on the FTO substrate and SEM images and X-ray powder diffraction patterns of NS-Ar before and after CO 2 photoconversion (PDF) Jih-Jen Wu -Department of Chemical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan 70101, Taiwan; orcid.org/0000-0001-5535-5878;Email: wujj mail.ncku.edu.tw Figure 1.(a) Top-view and (b) cross-sectional view of the SEM images of p-NS frameworks on FTO the substrate.Top-view SEM images of (c) NS-Ar and (d) NS-S frameworks.
