    "content": "The composites of cuprous oxide (Cu 2 O)/reduced graphene oxide (RGO) were prepared with copper acetate adsorbed graphene oxide (GO) sheets as precursors followed by in-situ reduction in the presence of ethylene glycol.The as-synthesized nanocomposites were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Raman spectroscopy, UV-Vis spectroscopy (UV), fluorescence spectroscopy (FL) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).The graphene sheets were decorated by spherical Cu 2 O particles with an average diameter of 200 nm.Such combination not only alleviates the agglomeration of Cu 2 O particles but also restrains the restacking of graphene.A preliminary study on the photo-catalytic activities of the Cu 2 O/RGO nanocomposites including photo-degradation of Rhodamine B dye and photo-reduction of CO 2 under the illumination of simulated sunlight was carried out.The as-synthesized nanocomposites showed better photo-catalytic activity than the conventional Cu 2 O particles.The photodegradation efficiency increased about 52 and the methanol yield improved about 53.The enhancements of the photo-catalytic activities were attributed to the effective charge transfer from Cu 2 O to RGO, enhanced specific surface area and increased reaction sites."

    "content": "Graphite flakes (325 mesh) was commercially obtained from XF NANO.N 2 H The synthesis of graphite oxide involved two steps.In the first step, 3 g of graphite flakes, 5 g of K 2 S 2 O 8 and 5 g of P 2 O 5 were dispersed into concentrated H 2 SO 4 and kept at 80 C for 4.5 h.The mixture was filtered, washed by deionized water and dried at ambient temperature to get pre-oxidized graphite.In the second step, graphite oxide was produced using a modified Hummers method from the pre-oxidized graphite.In brief, 3 g of pre-oxidized graphite was mixed with 1.5 g of NaNO 3 and 115 mL of H 2 SO 4 in an ice-bath, then 9 g of KMnO 4 was added to the suspension under vigorous agitation.The addition rate was controlled carefully to keep the temperature of the suspension below 20 C.Afterward, the mixture was stirred at 35 C for 2 h.Then 300 mL of distilled water was added while the temperature was kept at 98 C for 1 h.The suspension was further diluted to approximately 1 L with distilled water and treated with 30 wt. of H 2 O 2 to colorless aiming at reducing the residual permanganate and manganese dioxide.The mixture was filtered, washed with 5 wt.HCl aqueous solution and deionized water in turn until the pH value approached neutral.The graphite oxide was obtained after the filter being dried under vacuum at 40 C for 24 h. The synthesis of the Cu 2 O-RGO nanocomposites involved two steps as in Scheme 1.In the first step, 120 mg of copper acetate (Cu(AC) 2 ) and 200 mg of GO were dispersed into 400 mL of absolute ethanol under sonication for 2 h.The mixture was magnetically stirred for 4 h, then centrifuged and washed copiously with ethanol.The obtained sample was dried at 60 C for 8 h, being labeled as GO-Cu(AC) 2 .In the second step, 100 mg of GO-Cu(AC) 2 composite was mixed with 100 mL of ethylene glycol under sonication in a 250 mL beaker for 0.5 h and the pH value was regulated to 8, then transferred to a 250 mL roundbottomed flask and heated to 140 C under vigorous magnetic stirring.Subsequently, 5 mL of distilled water was added, and the mixture was heated at 160 C for 2 h.After the system was cooled to room temperature, the suspension was centrifuged, washed with absolute ethanol for five times to remove the remaining ethylene glycol and soluble by-products, and dried in a vacuum oven at 60 C for 6 h.The product was labeled as Cu 2 O-RGO.Additionally, Cu 2 O particles were synthesized by the same processes in absence of RGO for comparison. The photo-catalytic activity of the as-prepared catalysts was omeasured by the photo-degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) solution and the photo-reduction of CO 2 to methanol under the illumination of simulated solar light at ambient temperature. In a typical reaction, 100 mg of the catalyst was dispersed in 100 mL of a 10 mg/L RhB solution under ultrasonication for 1 min.Before illumination, the mixture was magnetically stirred for 30 min in the dark to establish adsorption-desorption equilibrium of the dye and the catalyst.A solar simulator with a 500 W Xe lamp was used as the light source.The experimental solution was placed in a quartz cuvette and placed at a distance of 200 mm from the light source.At given intervals, 3 mL of the suspension was withdrawn and centrifuged to remove the dispersed catalyst powder.The concentration of the clean transparent solution was determined by measuring the absorbance of RhB at 553 nm using a spectrophotometer (UV-5200PC, Shanghai Metash). The photo-reduction of carbon dioxide was carried out in a homemade apparatus.The photo-catalytic reduction was carried out in a glass cell with the light source placed in the middle equipped with a water-cooled jacket.Cu 2 O-RGO catalyst concentration was 1 g/L in 100 mL of 0.1 M NaOH aqueous solution.Prior to the illumination, CO 2 was bubbled with a constant flow through the stirred suspension for at least 30 min to purge the air and saturate the solution.The reactor was tightly closed.The samples of liquid reaction mixture were taken in different interval during the irradiation.A spot of the suspension were withdrawn by a syringe, filtered through a Millipore filter membrane and analyzed.The formation of methanol was determined by a gas chromatography equipped with FID using a 50 m long KB-FFAP column.Blank reactions were performed to ensure that the hydrocarbon production was due to the photo reduction of CO 2 and eliminate the surrounding interference.In the same experimental conditions, the first blank was illuminated without catalyst, the second was in the dark with catalyst and the third was illuminated with catalyst in absence of CO 2 .No hydrocarbons were detected in the above blank tests. The morphologies of the products were characterized by transmission electron microscope (TEM, H-800).The samples for TEM were prepared by dispersing the product in ethanol using a sonicator bath for 15 min and dropped on copper grid for observation.The dried products were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) on a D/max 2500 VB2/PC Advance diffractometer with Cu Ka radiation at a slow scan rate of 0.021/s to determine the structure.The Raman spectra were recorded on a Laser Micro-Raman Spectrometer with an excitation of 514 nm laser light.FT-IR spectra were measured on a Nicolet 6700 FT-IR spectrometer with KBr pellets as the sample matrix.UV-Vis spectra (UV-Vis) of the solid samples were recorded on a UV-3600 spectrophotometer, and the solution samples were recorded on a UV-5200PC spectrophotometer.The photo-luminescence emission spectra were characterized on an F-7000 PL spectrometer.The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out on a CHI660E workstation using three-electrode cells.The working electrodes were prepared by mixing the Cu 2 O or Cu 2 O/RGO, carbon black (Super-P) and PTFE at a weight ratio of 85:10:5 to get the paste followed by the paste being pasted onto foamed nickel, pressed and dried under vacuum at 120 C for 12 h."

    "content": "The morphologies and microstructures of the Cu 2 O-RGO nanocomposites and Cu 2 O nanoparticles were investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM).Fig. 1a shows a typical TEM image of Cu 2 O-RGO composites.It can be clearly seen that the RGO sheets are decorated by spherical Cu 2 O particles with an average diameter of 200 nm, which is consistent with the XRD analysis result.And these spherical crystals are distributed randomly on the surfaces and edges, just like the particles adhering to Scotch Tape.Furthermore, it can be seen that there is no apparent aggregation of Cu 2 O nanoparticles on the RGO.Fig. 1b confirms that the pure Cu 2 O nanoparticles appear obvious agglomeration and the average size of Cu 2 O particles is about 30 nm without RGO.It is deduced that such combination not only alleviates the agglomeration of Cu 2 O nanoparticles but also restrains the restacking of RGO and weakens the loss of high active surface area 24, moreover, the presence of RGO is in favor of particle' growth.The reasons may be related with the surface characters of graphene and the preparation process of nano composites.There are mainly hydroxyl and epoxy groups in the panels and carboxyl and carbonyl groups in the edges for graphene oxide.The action forces are different between these groups and Cu 2 .The combining points with weak actions are washed away during preparation process.Therefore, only a few points can be left for particles growth, which result in bigger particles due to excessive reactants in the system.It is believed that such perfect combination also enables fast electron transport through the underlying RGO layers, guaranteeing better electrochemical performances. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was employed to investigate the crystal phase.The XRD patterns of pure graphite, GO and RGO are shown in Fig. 2a.The (002) reflection peak of pure graphite appears at 2 26.5withhigher intensity, indicating that the spatial arrangement of graphite crystal layers is extremely regular.After oxidation, the (002) reflection peak is shifted to a lower angle (2 10.6), which corresponds to the (001) reflection of GO 25.This is due to the generation of oxygen functionalities in the interlayer spacing of graphite.The (001) reflection peak of GO is absent after reduction.The peak of RGO is around 2 23.2,which is close to the (002) reflection of graphite, however, the diffraction peak is wider and weaker.These show that the integrity of the crystalline structure declines and the randomness increases from the graphite to RGO.Fig. 2b shows the XRD patterns of Cu 2 O-RGO and pure Cu 2 O nanoparticles.It can be seen that almost all the diffraction peaks of Cu 2 O particles appear in Cu 2 O-RGO nanocomposites except the characteristic peak of RGO, which is at 2 23.2.Applying the Scherrer equation, the peaks width can be used to estimate the crystallite size of particle.For the Cu 2 O particles in nanocomposites, the crystallite size is estimated to be about 200 nm, which is consistent with the result of the TEM images. Raman scattering is highly sensitive to the electronic structure of carbon based materials, especially for the changes of the CC, CC, edges, defects and the randomness of C. The Raman spectra of graphite, GO, RGO and Cu 2 O-RGO are shown in Fig. 3.The spectrum of pure graphite has two bands at 1570 cm -1 and 1330 cm -1 , which correspond to the graphite (G) and diamondoid (D) bands, respectively 26.The appearance of the G band is due to the first-order scattering of E 2g phonons by sp 2 carbon atoms, the D band is attributed to the breathing mode of -point photons of A 1g symmetry 27.However, these two peaks appear at 1578 cm -1 and 1345 cm -1 in GO.The shift of the peak position indicates the destruction of sp 2 bonds and the formation of defects in the sheets due to oxidation.The Raman spectrum of GO has been used to compare the degree of defects in RGO.The I D /I G ratio increase from 0.94 in GO to 1.18 in RGO is attributed to the removal of oxygen functionalities and the decrease of the average size of the sp 2 domains formed in the RGO 28,29.The I D /I G value of Cu 2 O-RGO is 0.97.The values of nanocomposites are less than RGO, showing that the RGO in nanocomposites has fewer defects. In order to explore the changes of the functional groups of graphite during oxidation and reduction, the FT-IR analysis was also used.FT-IR spectra of GO, RGO and Cu 2 O-RGO are shown in Fig. 4. The stretching and bending vibration of the hydroxyl groups of GO appears at 3404 cm -1 .The broad absorption peak from about 1900 cm -1 to 3700 cm -1 are attributed to the characteristic stretching vibration of CH 2 , a strong peak at 1730 cm -1 corresponds to the stretching vibration of carboxyl groups (COOH) or the conjugate groups 30,31.A peak at 1632 cm -1 is due to the presence of sp 2 bond of graphite in GO.The two peaks at 1390 and 1072 cm -1 are an evidence of epoxy and alkoxy functional groups in GO.The presence of these oxygen-containing groups illustrates that graphite has been oxidized, and the polar groups, especially the presence of surface hydroxyl groups, make the GO easily form hydrogen bonds with water molecules and appear good hydrophilic.It is noteworthy that the characteristic peaks of GO either vanish or appear with significantly lower intensities after reduction.However, for the Cu 2 O-RGO nanocomposites, the absorption peaks of OH group (3404 cm -1 ) and epoxide group (1390 cm -1 ) become weak, the absorption peaks of CO, and CO oriented from COOH groups at 1072 cm -1 and 1720 cm -1 are absent.These results indicate that the GO has been reduced to a great extent (theoretical model predicted that the complete reduction may be difficult 32).Furthermore, the absorption band in the range of 624 cm -1 for the Cu 2 O-RGO can be assigned to the stretching vibration of CuO bond. UV-Vis absorption spectra are an informative and important technique to determine the change in the absorption of the semiconductor photo-catalysts.The reflectance data obtained are relative percentage reflectance to a non absorbing material (BaSO 4 ) which can optically diffuse light.Fig. 5 displays the UV-Vis absorption spectra of Cu 2 O-RGO nanocomposites and Cu 2 O nanoparticles.According to the spectra, the pure Cu 2 O nanoparticles have strong absorption in the UV region and a broad adsorption band from 250 to 500 nm.However, there is an enhanced absorbance in the visible light region for the Cu 2 O-RGO nanocomposites.Because there is only 4 of the ultraviolet light in the sunlight, therefore Cu 2 O-RGO nanocomposites may be more efficient to use sunlight and the photo-catalytic activity is expected to be enhanced.The increase of absorption in the visible light region is due to the reintroduction of black body properties typical of graphite-like materials (RGO), which can be ascribed to the increase of surface electric charge of Cu 2 O in the composites and restrain the recombination of electronic-hole pairs 33. The Fluorescence spectra have been widely used to investigate the efficiency of charge carrier trapping, immigration and transfer, and to reflect the fate of photo-generated electron-hole pairs from semiconductor particles under light illumination 34.Most of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs inevitably recombine at the surface or at bulk trapping sites with the release of photons and heat, resulting in fluorescence.The Fluorescence spectra of the Cu 2 O-RGO nanocomposites and pure Cu 2 O nanoparticles are shown in Fig. 6.The spectra exhibit a broad emission band in the range of 350-600 nm, which is ascribed to luminescence from localized surface states due to recombination of photo-generated electron-hole pairs 35.The introduction of RGO leads to a significant decrease in the emission intensity of the Fluorescence spectra.It indicates that the synergistic effect between two components can effectively reduce recombination rate of photoinduced electrons-holes and lead to an increased charge carrier separation.It is well known that fluorescence emission is caused by the recombination of electrons-hole, the weak intensity of fluorescence shows that the recombination rate of electronic-hole is lower.The Fluorescence results demonstrate that the RGO can serve as an effective electron-accepting material and hinder the direct recombination of electron-hole pairs in Cu 2 O and enhance the photocatalytic activity. The electrochemical impedance technique was employed to characterize electrical conductivity.The resultant electrode served as the working electrode with a platinum wire as the counter electrode and a saturated calomel electrode as the reference electrodes, which was performed in the presence of a 10 mM K 3 Fe(CN) 6 /K 4 Fe(CN) 6 (1:1) mixture as a redox probe in 0.5 M KCl solution.EIS measurements were recorded with an AC voltage amplitude of 10 mV and a frequency range of 10 mHz to 10 kHz.Fig. 7 compares the Nyquist plots of reference Cu 2 O and Cu 2 O/RGO electrodes.Apparently, the Cu 2 O/RGO electrode shows a much lower resistance than the Cu 2 O electrode (7 vs. 65 ).This is due to graphene being a zero bandgap semiconductor with a unique two-dimensional -conjugation structure, in which the charge carriers behave as massless fermions, leading to unique transport properties.Thus, In Cu 2 O/RGO, graphene serves as an acceptor of the generated electrons of Cu 2 O and effectively suppresses the charge recombination, leaving more charge carriers to form reactive species and promote the degradation of dyes.Overall, both the electron accepting and transporting properties of graphene in the composites could contribute to the suppression of charge recombination, and thereby a higher rate in the photocatalysis would be achieved. The photo-degradation of Rhodamine B dye and photo-catalytic reduction of carbon dioxide are used to compare the photo-catalytic reactivity of Cu 2 O-RGO and pure Cu 2 O. In order to evaluate the photo-degradation efficiency of semiconductor and semiconductor-graphene composites obtained in this work, a model substance of RhB is employed for the photo-degradation experiments under simulated solar light.The normalized temporal concentration changes (C 0 -C / C 0 ) of RhB during photo-degradation are shown in Fig. 8.It can be seen that the decomposition of RhB is negligible under simulated solar light without any catalyst (around 3 during 150 min exposure).However, an approximate 98.9 of the dyes are removed from the solution after 150 min in the presence of Cu 2 O-RGO nanocomposites.For comparison, the pure Cu 2 O nanoparticles were also checked, that only about 47.2 of RhB is decomposed under the same testing condition.It is fully demonstrated that Cu 2 O-graphene nanocomposites have much higher photo-catalytic activity than bare Cu 2 O under simulated solar light.In the meantime, the Cu 2 O-graphene nanocomposites also present higher dye adsorption capacity than Cu 2 O nanoparticles under the dark condition before the irradiation due to the higher specific surface area.All the above observation indicates that the introduction of RGO plays an active part in the adsorption and catalytic degradation process of dyes.Forth reasons may account for the enhanced catalytic activity of the Cu 2 O-graphene nanocomposites.First, RGO can adsorb more dye molecules on the catalyst surfaces so that the catalyst and RhB molecules can contact better.Second, due to its two-dimensional conjugation structure, RGO can act as an electron acceptor allowing for the photo-excited electrons of semiconductor in the composites to be quickly transferred from the conduction band of semiconductor to RGO.This eventually decreases the rate of recombination of the photogenerated electron hole pairs, which leads to an enhanced photocatalytic activity of the composites 36.Third, the unique features of reduced graphene oxide allow photocatalytic reactions to take place not only on the surface of Cu 2 O catalysts, but also on the reduced graphene oxide sheet, greatly enlarging the reaction space.Lastly, graphene provides a good base making Cu 2 O particles dispersion more uniform within a certain range of size, which was proved that the photo-catalytic effect of cuprous oxide was enhanced 37. In the photo-catalytic reduction reaction, carbon dioxide reacts with suspension in the presence of photo-catalyst and light to form a variety of products such as methane, methanol, and some higher hydrocarbons 38.In order to test the catalytic capability of our products, methanol was chosen as the target product for the photo-reduction of CO 2 .Fig. 9 shows the methanol yields of the photo-catalysts with the increase of irradiation time.The largest yields of methanol on Cu 2 O and Cu 2 O-RGO photo-catalysts under simulated sunlight irradiation for 10 h were 27.2 and 41.5 mol/g-cat, respectively.The results clearly indicate that the photo-catalytic performance of Cu 2 O can be greatly improved after incorporating RGO sheets. On the basis of the above results, a mechanism of the photodegradation reaction is proposed as illustrated in Fig. 10.It is believed that the efficient adsorption of dye molecules on the photo-catalysts and effective separation of photo-generated electron/hole pairs are the most important factors, which determine the efficiency of the photo-catalytic reaction.Under simulated sunlight irradiation, valence electrons of Cu 2 O are excited to the conduction band.The photogenerated electrons are transferred to the RGO, which acts as electron trap 39.The trapped electrons on RGO can react with the dissolved oxygen to form reactive oxygen species 40.In this way, electronhole recombination rate decreases.The photo-generated electrons on Cu 2 O surface can also be trapped directly by the dissolved oxygen to form reactive oxygen species, which react with water to create hydroxyl radicals.The RhB is then degraded by the hydroxyl groups.On the other hand, holes on the valence band of Cu 2 O react with absorbed water or hydroxyl groups to form surface hydroxyl radicals which can also degrade RhB.Moreover, the holes can also oxidize the dye molecules directly.The main reactions can be expressed as in the following: On the other hand, though the detailed mechanism of the photoreduction of the CO 2 aqueous solution has not been fully understood, some basic processes and major steps have been proposed 41424344.Classically, a series of free radical reactions can be initiated by photongenerated excited electrons and valence band holes which are formed by the excited Cu excited electron reacts with H forming H radical.The electron and H radical react with CO 2 to create CH 3 OH (Fig. 11).The main reactions can be expressed as in the following:"

    "content": "In summary, Cu 2 O-RGO nanocomposites were prepared via in-situ reduction in the presence of ethylene glycol using copper acetateadsorbed graphite oxide (GO) sheets as precursors.The reduced graphene oxide sheets were decorated by spherical Cu 2 O particles with an average diameter of 200 nm, which were distributed randomly on the surface and edges of the RGO sheets.Notably, Cu 2 O-RGO nanocomposites show better photo-catalytic activities toward the degradation of RhB dye and the reduction of CO 2 under the irradiation of simulated sunlight than pure Cu 2 O particles.This work not only demonstrates that RGO is a very promising candidate for the development of high-performance photo-catalysts but also opens new possibilities to provide some insight into the design of new modified photo-catalysts with high activity for environmental purification and other applications.
