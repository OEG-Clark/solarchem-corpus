    "content": "Photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 to renewable solar fuels is considered to be a promising strategy to simultaneously solve both global warming and energy crises.However, development of a superior photocatalytic system with high product selectivity for CO 2 reduction under solar light is the prime requisite.Herein, a series of nature-inspired Z-scheme g C 3 N 4 /FeWO 4 composites are prepared for higher performance and selective CO 2 reduction to CO as solar fuel under solar light.The novel direct Z-scheme coupling of the visible light-active FeWO 4 nanoparticles with C 3 N 4 nanosheets is seen to exhibit excellent performance for CO production with a rate of 6 mol/g/h at an ambient temperature, almost 6 times higher compared to pristine C 3 N 4 and 15 times higher than pristine FeWO 4 .More importantly, selectivity for CO is 100 over other carbon products from CO 2 reduction and more than 90 over H 2 products from water splitting.Our results clearly demonstrate that the staggered band structure between FeWO 4 and C 3 N 4 reflecting the nature-inspired Z-scheme system not only favors superior spatial separation of the electron-hole pair in g-C 3 N 4 /FeWO 4 but also shows good reusability.The present work provides unprecedented insights for constructing the direct Z-scheme by mimicking the nature for high performance and selective photocatalytic CO 2 reduction into solar fuels under solar light."

    "content": "2.1.Material Synthesis.2.1.1.Synthesis of C 3 N 4 .C 3 N 4 was synthesized by following the protocol given in previously reported literature. 49Briefly, melamine C 3 N 3 (NH 2 ) 3 (S D Fine Chem Limited) and NH 4 Cl (Loba Chemie) were mixed in a 1:3 ratio by weight and ground properly in a mortar and pestle.This mixture was heated in an inert atmosphere at 550 C for 4 h with 5 C/min in an alumina boat.The sample was cooled down to room temperature, and the obtained pale yellow colored C 3 N 4 powder was collected for further use. 2 For preparing the 80 composite, 80 mg of C 3 N 4 and 20 mg of FeWO 4 were dispersed in 10 mL of distilled water separately and sonicated for an hour to get well-dispersed homogenous suspensions.Then, the two solutions were mixed and sonicated for the next 2 h.The mixed solution was dried overnight at 80 C.The obtained powder was collected and heated in Ar at 400 C for 2 h with 5 C/min in an alumina boat.Finally, the composite sample was cooled down to room temperature and collected.A similar method was used for 50 and 30 composites with respective C 3 N 4 and FeWO 4 weight ratios. 2.2.Characterization.2.2.1.Material Characterization.The structural phases of C 3 N 4 , FeWO 4 , and C 3 N 4 /FeWO 4 samples were confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer equipped with a Cu K lamp source for irradiation 1.54 A).For the morphology study, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, FEI Nova Nano SEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) (JEOL JEM-2200FS, JEOL, Japan at an acceleration voltage of 200 keV) techniques were used.For surface area and porosity estimation, measurements were performed on a Quantachrome Autosorb automated gas sorption analyzer at 77 K. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was performed on a Thermo scientific NICOLET 6700 FTIR spectrophotometer in the range of 250-4000 cm -1 with a BaSO 4 pellet as the reference.Photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the samples were recorded at room temperature on a steady-state spectroflurometer FLS 980 (Edinburgh Instruments) equipped with a 450 W xenon lamp.The ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectrum (UV-vis DRS) was obtained by using a SHIMADZU UV-3600 plus UV-vis-near-infrared spectrophotometer with an integrating sphere attachment.X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement was carried out using a Thermo K-Alpha spectrometer using microfocused and monochromated Al K radiation with 1486.6 eV energy. 2.3.Photoelectrochemical Measurements.The on-off transient measurements were carried out in a three-electrode system using an Autolab PGSTAT 30 potentiostat under the illumination of a solar simulator (Newport) with an ultraviolet (UV) ( 420 nm) cutoff filter and 100 mW/cm 2 power density.Ag/AgCl was used as the reference electrode, and platinum was used as the counter electrode.The sample coated on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) served as the working electrode.The electrolyte used was 0.5 M Na 2 SO 3 .The photoelectrodes were fabricated by preparing the slurry in a mortar and pestle by adding 40 mg of the sample, 200 L of Nafion (5), and 1 mL of isopropyl alcohol.The obtained paste was coated on FTO with 1 cm 2 area and heated at 250 C for 1 h to get a homogenous film.Mott-Schottky (MS) plots were recorded at a scan rate of 10 mV/s in Na 2 SO 3 neutral solution in the dark at a frequency of 10 kHz. 2.4.Photocatalytic Measurements.Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction experiments were carried out in a stainless steel photoreactor with a quartz window setup under the illumination of a solar simulator (100 mW/cm 2 ) with a xenon lamp of 300 W.About 50 mg of the sample was dispersed in 20 mL of 0.5 M Na 2 SO 3 .Prior to irradiation, the reaction setup was purged with He (20 mL/min for 1 h) to remove the air and then purged with high purity CO 2 (1 bar, 5 mL/ min) for 1 h.During irradiation, 1 mL of the gaseous product from the setup was sampled, and subsequent analysis was done by gas chromatography (Shimadzu Tracera GC-2010 Plus) with a barrier ionization detector and He carrier gas.Blank experiments were carried out in the absence of CO 2 and light to confirm that these two factors are indispensable for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction.For stability test, the selected photocatalyst was collected after each run and refreshed by washing with water, and its performance was reevaluated by the aforementioned procedure. The selectivity of the formed CO was deduced according to the following equation 50 Here, N CO and N H 2 stand for the yield of reactively formed CO and H 2 , respectively.Apparent quantum yield of the photocatalyst was calculated using the following equation 50 The number of evolved CO molecules 2 The number of incident photons 100"

    "content": "In the present study, the composite C 3 N 4 /FeWO 4 was synthesized by a simple ultrasonic-assisted (sonochemical) method followed by post-thermal treatment, which is illustrated schematically in Scheme 1. Individually, C 3 N 4 nanosheets and FeWO 4 nanoparticles were ultrasonicated to get exfoliated C 3 N 4 nanosheets and uniformly dispersed FeWO 4 nanoparticles.In the next step, the two solutions were mixed together and ultrasonicated again, which allows the coupling between C 3 N 4 and FeWO 4 through electrostatic interactions.The positively and negatively charged surfaces of C 3 N 4 and FeWO 4 , respectively, help them assemble into heterojunction configurations driven by the forces of electro-static attraction, as confirmed by zeta potential data 19,34,50,51 presented in Supporting Information Figure S1.Further, the attachment is enhanced by the thermal treatment given to the composite at 400 C for 2 h.With the above mentioned protocol, 80, 50, and 30 wt C 3 N 4 /FeWO 4 composites were prepared and evaluated for photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 . The crystal structures of C 3 N 4 , FeWO 4 , and their composites were confirmed by XRD, as given in Figure 1. The pristine C 3 N 4 showed two characteristic peaks at 13.0a nd 27.4indexed, respectively, to the (100) diffraction plane corresponding to the in-plane packing motif of tri-s-triazine and the (002) plane corresponding to the interlayer stacking of aromatic rings. 18,50For FeWO 4 , all peaks are well-matched with JCPDF-0712390, confirming the wolframite family with a monoclinic crystal structure.Besides, no other phases were observed indicating the phase purity of samples.In all cases of composites, characteristic peaks of C 3 N 4 and FeWO 4 were observed indicating the coexistence of both the phases.Neither any shift in the peaks nor any other impurity peaks were observed.Although, the characteristic peak of C 3 N 4 in the 30 composite is not clearly seen (though it can be clearly seen on the log scale, as shown in Supporting Information S2), as the percentage of C 3 N 4 is increased in the composite, the peak of the (002) plane can be seen distinctly, especially in the case of 80 C 3 N 4 /FeWO 4 . FESEM and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were employed to investigate the morphology and microstructure of the as-prepared samples.Figure 2a shows the stacked, curly, two-dimensional (2D) nanosheet-like structure of C 3 N 4 , whereas Figure 2b displays cuboid-like nanoparticles of FeWO 4 with a particle size of 40-50 nm.In the composite case (Figure 2c), the stacked and compact nanosheet of C 3 N 4 loaded with nanoparticles of FeWO 4 is seen.It can be seen from the image that the particles are not only decorated on the sheet but also present in between the stacked nanosheets of C 3 N 4 .In either case, it is clear that the FeWO 4 nanoparticles are firmly anchored onto the C 3 N 4 nanosheets.Elemental dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) spectra (Supporting Information S3) and elemental mapping (Supporting Information S4) of the composite (80 wt C 3 N 4 /FeWO 4 ) clearly indicate that the sample is composed of elements C, N, Fe, W, and O and that there is uniform distribution of FeWO 4 nanoparticles on the surface of C 3 N 4 nanosheets.The FTIR spectra of C 3 N 4 , FeWO 4 , and (30, 50 and 80 wt ) C 3 N 4 /FeWO 4 are given in Figure 3.In pure C 3 N 4 , the peak at 1628 cm -1 corresponds to C-N stretching vibration modes, whereas the peaks at 1410, 1323, and 1235 cm -1 belong to aromatic C-N stretching.The characteristic peak at 809 cm -1 is ascribed to the breathing modes of tris-triazine units. 18,50In the infrared spectrum of FeWO 4 , the peaks at 500 and 550 cm -1 are assigned to the asymmetric vibrational mode of Fe-O, whereas the peaks at 633 and 700 cm -1 correspond to the stretching modes of W-O.The broad band at 844 cm -1 is the characteristic peak of the asymmetric vibration of the bridge oxygen atom of Fe-O-W. 37,52In the FTIR spectrum of composites, all peaks of C 3 N 4 and FeWO 4 are seen, but a major shift is seen in Fe-O and W-O vibrational modes.Similarly, in the Fe-O-W mode, a red shift is seen with the increased introduction of C 3 N 4 in the composite, as given in enlarged inset figure of FTIR.Inversely, the characteristic vibrational modes of tris-s-triazine units in C 3 N 4 also showed a To discover the surface chemical bonds of the photocatalyst, XPS data was recorded and is presented in Figure 4.In Figure 4a, the C 1s spectra of pure C 3 N 4 and 80 wt C 3 N 4 /FeWO 4 are compared.The peak centered at 284.6 eV corresponds to the C-C bond, whereas the peak at 288 eV corresponds to tertiary carbon C-N 3 . 19,33,34Both the peaks are present in pure C 3 N 4 as well as in the composite without any shift.In the N 1s spectrum (Figure 4b), three binding energies 398.9 eV (CN-C), 400. 40The same five peaks are also present in the composite but with a downward shift in the binding energy.The shifts in the O 1s and N 1s contributions establish that C 3 N 4 and FeWO 4 have formed a heterostructure and that the composite is not a simple physical mixture.This is of immense significance for the transfer of photogenerated charges across the interface as discussed later.In the Fe 2p spectra of FeWO 4 and the C 3 N 4 / FeWO 4 composite, two main peaks of 2p 3/2 and 2p 1/2 are seen without the presence of any satellite peak, which indicate that Fe exists in a pure 2 state.Similarly, in the W 4f spectrum, two symmetric peaks of 4f 5/2 and 4f 7/2 are seen, indicating the W 6 oxidation state. 40o investigate and understand the opto-electronic properties of the prepared photocatalyst under study, UV-vis DRS, PL, and MS measurements were performed.From the DRS spectra given in Figure 5, it is clear that C 3 N 4 has an absorption band edge at around 440 nm corresponding to a band gap of 2.8 eV calculated from the Tauc plot given in Supporting Information Figure S6a, which is in agreement with previously reported values. 8,9,19In contrast, FeWO 4 exhibits a wide absorption range till 530 nm corresponding to a band gap of 2.3 eV (Figure S6b).Markedly, different from the absorption features of pristine C 3 N 4 and FeWO 4 , the composite 80 wt C 3 N 4 / FeWO 4 shows two distinct optical absorption edges ascribed to the intrinsic absorption edges of individual components.This implies the combined optical absorption property of C 3 N 4 and FeWO 4 . PL analysis was performed to study the interfacial charge transfer and separation efficiency of photogenerated electrons and holes in C 3 N 4 /FeWO 4 .The PL spectra given in Figure 6a display a broad PL emission peak centered at 455 nm for pristine C 3 N 4 , which is in line with the previous reports. 34,50he peak is attributed to the band-to-band PL because of recombination of photo carriers in C 3 N 4 .In addition, strong PL quenching is possibly observed in the case of the C 3 N 4 / FeWO 4 composite, suggesting the suppressed carrier recombination and improved charge separation, owing to the formation of C 3 N 4 /FeWO 4 heterostructure with a strong interaction.Furthermore, charge transfer and separation efficiency were evaluated by transient photocurrent response given in Figure 6b.The strong photocurrent in the case of 3.1.Photocatalytic Activity of C 3 N 4 /FeWO 4 .The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance of the pristine and composite photocatalysts was evaluated under solar light using Na 2 SO 3 as a hole scavenger.The products were analyzed in regular intervals of 1 h, as shown in Figure 7. CO (CO 2 2H 2e - CO H 2 O) was found to be the main and direct product of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.However, H 2 (2H 2e - H 2 ) was also detected because of water-splitting reaction, whereas holes were consumed by Na 2 SO 3 (Na 2 SO 3 2OH - 2h Na 2 SO 4 H 2 O).The control experiments (Supporting Information, Figure S8) in the absence of a photocatalyst or light or CO 2 were also performed, confirming that the obtained CO solely originates from CO 2 photoreduction and that light, CO 2 , and photocatalyst are essential for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction. Very interestingly, C 3 N 4 /FeWO 4 composites showed excellent performance for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction under solar light irradiation, as shown in Figure 7a.After 5 h of irradiation, optimum photocatalytic activity over 80 wt C 3 N 4 /FeWO 4 was 30.6 mol/g, which is almost 6-fold and 15fold higher as compared to pristine C 3 N 4 (6.02 mol/g) and FeWO 4 (1.94 mol/g) samples, respectively.The optimum CO production rate of 80 wt C 3 N 4 /FeWO 4 is also relatively higher than those of the other composites: 30 C 3 N 4 /FeWO 4 (18.9 mol/g) and 50 C 3 N 4 /FeWO 4 (22.9 mol/g).The low performance of C 3 N 4 and FeWO 4 can be attributed to the electron-hole recombination prevailing in the system.Additionally, FeWO 4 possesses unfavorable energy levels for CO 2 reduction, as seen from the MS plot (Figure 6d).Although during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, the undesired H 2 evolution from water splitting is observed (Figure 7b), the CO selectivity is greater than 90 over H 2 evolution.Notably, the selectivity of CO for 80 wt C 3 N 4 /FeWO 4 is almost 100 over hydrocarbons as no CH 4 or any other higher hydrocarbons were seen to evolve.Furthermore, the measured apparent quantum efficiency for the 80 wt C 3 N 4 /FeWO 4 composite using a 420 nm band pass filter is significant (0.3) and higher than that reported in the literature. 535455 It is well-known that the catalyst reusability is always a critical issue for the long run performance of CO 2 reduction in practical applications.To investigate the stability of the C 3 N 4 / FeWO 4 composite, three successive cyclic experimental runs were performed under the same experimental conditions.Each run was conducted after evacuation and purging of fresh CO 2 in the setup.As shown in Figure 8, the photocatalytic CO evolution of the composite is nearly constant even after three successive experimental runs of total 18 h of illumination.A slight decrease after the third cycle, retaining almost 97 original activity, is observed, which may be due to inevitable loss of the catalyst during the cyclic run.The reusability results are a direct evidence of firm attachment of FeWO 4 to C 3 N 4 nanosheets, also indicating a strongly built-in heterojunction between them to produce a constant outcome throughout the long run. 3.2.Photocatalytic Mechanism.To understand the mechanism of enhanced photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction of the C 3 N 4 /FeWO 4 composites, band line-ups were obtained with respect to the CO 2 reduction potential, with the values derived from UV-vis DRS and MS plots.The derived energy level diagram given in Figure 9 clearly indicates that the CB edge of C 3 N 4 is just above the reduction potential of CO 2 (-0.51 V vs NHE), 8,9 whereas that of FeWO 4 is below it.Thus, C 3 N 4 has much more favorable energy levels compared to FeWO 4 individually, but interestingly as a composite, they exhibit enhanced photocatalytic activity. Considering the band structures of C 3 N 4 and FeWO 4 , two possible charge transfers are possible: type II heterojunction and direct Z-scheme.According to conventional type II heterojunction, which is band-to-band charge transfer, the photogenerated electrons from the CB of C 3 N 4 must be transferred to the CB of FeWO 4 where CO 2 reduction is expected to occur; on the other hand, holes are transferred from the VB of C 3 N 4 to the VB of FeWO 4 .However, our catalytic activity and band-structure results clearly show this to be unlikely in the present heterostructure system because of unfavorable energy levels of FeWO 4 for CO 2 reduction to CO.Therefore, because of band-structure matching, Z-scheme is the feasible mechanism in the present system.In the Z-scheme C 3 N 4 /FeWO 4 composite system, the C 3 N 4 and FeWO 4 photocatalysts are in contact with band matching in such a way that the electrons from the CB of FeWO 4 will combine with the holes from the VB of C 3 N 4 after photo excitation, leaving electrons in C 3 N 4 , where CO 2 reduction to CO takes place because of the appropriate band potential for CO formation, and holes in FeWO 4 , that is, electrons and holes are spatially separated in different locations.This kind of spatially separated photocatalytic system has great advantage as efficient charge separation can be achieved and thereby high performance is realized for photocatalytic reactions. As seen from Figure 9, FeWO 4 has a relatively negative conduction potential (0.42 V vs NHE) with respect to the C 3 N 4 VB potential (1.5 V vs NHE), which effectively favors the Z-scheme mechanism.As a result, the electrons in the CB of C 3 N 4 with high reducibility are greatly preserved (which would otherwise combine with its own holes from the VB), whereas holes in the VB of FeWO 4 with their high oxidizibility are preserved.Consequently, more photogenerated electrons are available to perform the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .Ultimately, CO yield and selectivity both are enhanced in the C 3 N 4 /FeWO 4 composite as compared to its pure counterparts.Notably, despite the unfavorable energy levels of FeWO 4 for CO 2 reduction, only 20 addition of FeWO 4 in the composite (80 wt C 3 N 4 /FeWO 4 ) has shown an immense enhancement in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction as compared to 100 C 3 N 4 , which justifies the possible direct scheme mechanism.To confirm the role of FeWO 4 and Z-scheme mechanism in the present system, we studied the hydroxyl radical formation using terephthalic acid as a probe molecule in the PL analysis. It is well-know that terephthalic acid readily combines with the OH radical and forms 2-hydroxyterephthalic acid, which shows a PL emission peak around 425 nm.Comparison of the PL intensity for all samples against irradiation time was monitored and is given in Figure 10b.For FeWO 4 (Supporting Information Figure S9) and the composite C 3 N 4 /FeWO 4 sample (Figure 10a), a gradual increase in the PL intensity was observed as compared to C 3 N 4 , indicating the formation of OH radical on their surfaces upon illumination except for -.If the obtained composite C 3 N 4 /FeWO 4 would have followed the conventional heterojunction mechanism, then neither OH radical nor superoxide radical anion O 2 would be produced, thus resulting in subsequent absence of the PL signal.However, the strong PL signal in the composite was seen to increase linearly with time and has intensity greater than that for pristine FeWO 4 , as shown in Figure 10b.Thus, OH radicals were indeed produced in the case of the composite, which confirms the direct Z-scheme mechanism in C 3 N 4 /FeWO 4 instead of the conventional heterojunction type.Consequently, the prevailing recombination in C 3 N 4 is highly suppressed (evident from PL and on-off transient), as the holes from the VB of C 3 N 4 are very well-quenched by the electrons from the CB of FeWO 4 under the Z-scheme mechanism, preserving the photogenerated electrons in C 3 N 4 for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.Thus, coupling of FeWO 4 with C 3 N 4 under the Z-scheme mechanism has not only induced efficient charge separation in C 3 N 4 but also restored its reducing capability, resulting in almost 6-fold enhancement in photocatalytic performance along with high CO selectivity."

    "content": "In summary, a direct Z-scheme C 3 N 4 /FeWO 4 photocatalytic system was constructed by a simple sonochemical method, followed by postannealing treatment, which assembled the two components in the composite through electrostatic attraction and through thermal attachment.The resultant composite exhibited excellent photocatalytic performance and selectivity for CO 2 reduction.The optimum C 3 N 4 /FeWO 4 showed the highest CO production rate of 6 mol/g/h, which is almost 6 times and 15 times higher than pure-C 3 N 4 and FeWO 4 phases, respectively.Moreover, it showed almost 91 CO selectivity with no CH 4 or any other higher hydrocarbon evolution.The overall performance of the new photocatalytic system is ascribed to the direct Z-scheme mechanism with appropriate band matching of FeWO 4 with respect to C 3 N 4 band edges.The novel coupling under the Z-scheme mechanism of the hybrid photocatalyst not only favors superior charge separation of the electron-hole pair in C 3 N 4 but also restores the reducibility of C 3 N 4 for CO 2 photoreduction.Importantly, the Z-scheme photocatalyst was photostable even after successive experimental runs, without any obvious change in the activity.The present work provides significant insights for constructing a stable functional composite via Z-scheme for selective photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .
