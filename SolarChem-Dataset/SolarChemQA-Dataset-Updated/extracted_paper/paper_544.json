    "content": "Vacancy engineering, that is, self-doping of vacancy in semiconductors, has become a commonly used strategy to tune the photocatalytic performances.However, there still lacks fundamental understanding of the role of the vacancies in semiconductor materials.Herein, the g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets with tunable nitrogen vacancies are prepared as the photocatalysts for H 2 evolution and CO 2 reduction to CO.On the basis of both experimental investigation and DFT calculations, nitrogen vacancies in g-C 3 N 4 induce the formation of midgap states under the conduction band edge.The position of midgap states becomes deeper with the increasing of nitrogen vacancies.The g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets with the optimized density of nitrogen vacancies display about 18 times and 4 times enhancement for H 2 evolution and of CO 2 reduction to CO, respectively, as compared to the bulk g-C 3 N 4 .This is attributed to the synergistic effects of several factors including (1) nitrogen vacancies cause the excitation of electrons to midgap states below the conduction band edge, which results in extension of the visible light absorption to photons of longer wavelengths (up to 598 nm); (2) the suitable midgap states could trap photogenerated electrons to minimize the recombination loss of photogenerated electron-hole pairs; and (3) nitrogen vacancies lead to uniformly anchored small Pt nanoparticles (1-2 nm) on g-C 3 N 4 , and facilitate the electron transfer to Pt.However, the overintroduction of nitrogen vacancies generates deeper midgap states as the recombination centers, which results in deterioration of photocatalytic activities.Our work is expected to provide new insights for fabrication of nanomaterials with suitable vacancies for solar fuel generation."

    "content": "Sample Preparation.Bulk g-C 3 N 4 was prepared by heating melamine (6 g) in a semicovered crucible to 550 C for 4 h with a heating rate of 5 C min -1 in a muffle furnace.After being cooled naturally, the yellow product was grounded in an agate mortar to obtain a powder sample.To prepare g-C 3 N 4 with different nitrogen vacancy densities, the bulk g-C 3 N 4 was heated to an appropriate temperature (ranging from 475 to 550 C) for 1 h with a heating rate of 2 C min -1 in hydrogen atmosphere.The yields of samples heated at 475, 500, 525, and 550 C are 80, 56, 42, and 33, respectively. Characterization.The crystal phase of the as-prepared samples was characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker D2 Phaser) equipped with Cu K radiation.The morphology of the samples was observed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, JEOL JSM 6701F) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL 3010).X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was conducted on an AXIS-HSi spectroscope (Kratos Analytical) using a monochromated Al K X-ray source (1486.7 eV), and the binding energy was calibrated using the C 1s peak at 284.6 eV.The UV-visible absorption spectra were obtained on a UV-2450 spectrophotometer (Shimadazu) at room temperature.Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were collected on a Fluoromax-3 spectrometer (Horiba Scientific) at room temperature with the sample tube immersed in a quartz liquid nitrogen dewar.The specific surface area of the samples was measured by nitrogen sorption at 77 K on surface area and porosity analyzer (Quantachrome Autosorb-6B, U.S.), and samples were degassed offline at 120 C for 16 h under vacuum before analysis.FTIR spectra were obtained with a PerkinElmer FTIR Spectrum GX using KBr technique in the range of 4000-400 cm -1 .Elemental analyses for carbon and nitrogen were performed on a Vario EL III Element analyzer.Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) was carried out with f 9.7688 GHz on a Bruker EMX-10/12 EPR spectrometer. Photoelectrochemical Measurement.Five milligrams of photocatalysts and 10 L of Nafion solution (5 wt ) were dispersed in 1 mL of ethanol and then ultrasonically dispersed to prepare a homogeneous catalyst ink.Next, 40 L of the catalyst ink was deposited onto an area of 0.196 cm 2 on ITO conductive glass and then was dried in air and further heated at 300 C for 1 h in argon atmosphere to form the working electrode.Photoelectrochemical measurements were carried out in a three-electrode configuration system: a FTO working electrode, Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode, and a Pt foil as the counter electrode.Na 2 SO 4 (0.5 M) aqueous solution was used as the electrolyte.The photocurrent was observed for each switch-on/-off event by using a 300 W xenon lamp.An applied potential of working electrode against the counter electrode was set to 0.6 V. EIS was recorded at an applied potential of 0 V versus Ag/AgCl over the frequency range from 1 MHz to 0.1 Hz. Photocatalytic Measurement.The photocatalytic H 2 evolution reaction was conducted in a top window Pyrex cell (total volume about 300 mL with a top irradiation area of around 28 cm 2 ) connected to a closed gas circulation and evacuation system.In a typical run, 50 mg of the photocatalyst was dispersed in an aqueous solution of TEOA (15 vol , pH 11.0, 100 mL).Next, 3 wt Pt as the cocatalyst was in situ photodeposited on the surface of photocatalysts.A 300 W xenon lamp equipped with a 420 nm cutoff filter (Newport) was used as the visible light source.Before light irradiation, the reaction system was evacuated and refilled with argon gas for several times to remove air and finally filled with argon gas to reach about 30 Torr.The reaction cell was kept at about 20 C by a cooling water jacket.The produced H 2 gas was analyzed with an online gas chromatograph (Agilent 6890N, TCD detector, argon as carrier gas, 5 A molecular sieve column).The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) was measured under the same conditions except by replacing the 420 nm cutoff filter with a band-pass interference filter (Newport) centered at 420, 440, 460,480, 500, 520, and 550 nm, respectively, during the second hour of the reaction.The AQE was calculated according to eq 1: 2 the number of evolved H molecules the number of incident photons 100 2 (1) The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction experiments were performed in a closed circulation system by using a Pyrex cell reactor.About 50 mg of the photocatalyst was uniformly dispersed on the glass reactor with an area of 4.2 cm 2 .A 300 W xenon lamp equipped with a 420 nm cutoff filter (Newport) was used as the light source.The reaction setup was vacuum-treated several times, and then high-purity CO 2 gas (99.999) was flowed into the reaction setup for reaching the ambient pressure.Subsequently, 0.4 mL of deionized water was injected into the reaction system as the electron donor.The as-prepared photocatalysts were allowed to equilibrate in the CO 2 /H 2 O atmosphere for several hours to ensure that the adsorption of gas molecules was completed.The gas products were analyzed with an online gas chromatograph (Agilent 7890a, FID detector, argon as carrier gas, column: Band Structure Calculations.The DFT calculations were performed by the VASP 46,47 code with the projected-augmentedwave (PAW 48 ) method.For the exchange-correlation functional, the generalized gradient approximation (GGA 49 ) in the scheme of Perdew-Bueke-Ernzerh (PBE 50 ) was used.Because of the layered structure of g-C 3 N 4 , the van der Waals (vdW) correction proposed by Grimme 51 was chosen because of its good description of long-range vdW interactions. 52For C and N, the 2s 2 2p 4 and 2s 2 2p 5 orbitals, respectively, were treated as the conduction and valence states.The cutoff energy for basis functional is 500 eV. The atomic structure of g-C 3 N 4 is shown in Figure S1.We first optimized the atomic structure of g-C 3 N 4 on the basis of the above computational parameters.Next, to simulate the nitrogen vacancy in g-C 3 N 4 , we further used the optimized g-C 3 N 4 cell to build a 2 2 2 supercell of g-C 3 N 4 , which includes 96C and 128N atoms.The gamma centered 2 2 2 meshes of k-points were adopted for the Brillouin zone integration.Because of the large size of this supercell, DFT calculations using a relative accurate computational scheme, for example, the hybrid functional, may cost a huge computational resource.We then only used the GGA-PBE method to perform all of the DFT calculations.The band gap of g-C 3 N 4 calculated by GGA-PBE functional is 1.03 eV, which is much smaller than the experimental value (2.7 eV), due to the well-known limitation of DFT. 53,54However, we merely aim at a qualitatively comparison between the pure and nitrogen vacancy contained g-C 3 N 4 .The GGA-PBE scheme is expected to be accurate enough to achieve this goal."

    "content": "Characterization of g-C 3 N 4 with Heat Treatment.The bulk g-C 3 N 4 labeled as BCN was synthesized via thermal polycondensation of melamine at 550 C for 4 h.The g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets with varied density of nitrogen vacancies were prepared by heating the BCN at temperatures ranging from 475 to 550 C under H 2 atmosphere, and the corresponding samples were labeled as CN-x where x refers to the heat treatment temperature (CN-475, CN-500, CN-525, and CN-550).The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of all samples (Figure 1a) clearly show the two typical diffraction peaks at 13.2 and 27.4 C, which are, respectively, associated with the in-plane structural packing motifs of tris-triazine units (Figure S1) and the interlayer stacking of conjugated aromatic systems. 55As shown in the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra (Figure 1b), the characteristic absorption bands of all samples (3000-3500 cm -1 for O-H or N-H stretching, 1200-1700 cm -1 for stretching of CN heterocycles, and 805 cm -1 for stretching of triazine units) indicate the formation of g-C 3 N 4 . 56No obvious changes among the samples can be observed.Therefore, it is confirmed that the basic atomic structure of g-C 3 N 4 is still maintained after postheating treatment. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of CN-525 reveal that the sample consists of thin, porous, and flexible sheet-like nanostructures (Figure 2).As shown in the inset of Figure 2, the pores with an average diameter of about 20 nm can be observed on g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets.The porosity and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area were measured by nitrogen physisorption method (Figure S2).The nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms of all samples display type IV curves with an H3 hysteresis loop, indicating the presence of mesopores. 57After postheat treatment, the total pore volume and the BET surface area gradually increase from 0.19 cm 3 g -1 and 21.45 m 2 g -1 of BCN to 0.78 cm 3 g -1 and 89.2 m 2 g -1 of CN-550, respectively.The enhancement of pore volume and BET surface area should be originated from the exfoliation of BCN into nanosheets with etched in-plane pores, which could offer abundant edges as active sites and channels for mass transfer during photocatalytic reactions. Identification of Tunable Nitrogen Vacancies Confined in g-C 3 N 4 .To confirm the generation of tunable nitrogen vacancies confined in g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets, three complementary analytical methods were used.First, elemental analysis shows that the C/N atomic ratio gradually increases from 0.635 in BCN to 0.674 in CN-550 as the heat treatment temperature was increased, implying the gradual release of nitrogen species from g-C 3 N 4 and the growing number of nitrogen vacancies (Figure 3a).It is noted that the C/N ratio of g-C 3 N 4 obtained from thermal condensation of melamine is generally lower than the stoichiometric ratio of 0.75 in ideal g-C 3 N 4 .This is due to the residual amino groups that originated from incomplete condensation of the precursor, which is in agreement with the FTIR results. 58It is found a slight shift in the frequencies of bands below 2000 cm -1 toward low frequency after vacancy formation, which also indicates the nitrogen vacancy generation.Second, the X-ray photoelectron S3a). 59The ratio of the peak area of C-NC group to N-(C) 3 gradually decreases from 4.68 (BCN) to 3.82 (CN-550) with increasing temperature, suggesting that the loss of nitrogen atoms probably occurs at the twocoordinated lattice sites during the thermal reduction process (Figure 3b).From calculation in ref 44, the energy changes (E) for removing a two-coordinated lattice site and threecoordinated lattice site in H 2 reduced atmosphere are 1.40 and 2.39 eV, respectively, also revealing that the two-coordinated lattice sites could be easily removed. 44Finally, the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy can provide fingerprint evidence for probing the surface vacancies in semiconductor photocatalysts.As shown in Figure 3c, all samples display a single Lorentzian line with a g value of 2.0021 in the magnetic field from 3440 to 3530 G, which is associated with the unpaired electrons of sp 2 -carbon atoms within conjugated aromatic rings. 60Analogous to the role of oxygen vacancies on TiO 2 surface that donate excess unpaired electrons to Ti atoms and subsequently reduce Ti 4 to Ti 3 paramagnetic species, 61 the formation of two-coordinated nitrogen vacancies also could donate unpaired electrons to adjacent sp 2 -carbon atoms within -conjugated aromatic rings in g-C 3 N 4 .As compared to BCN with an almost negligible EPR signal, the intensity of EPR signal gradually enhances, revealing the increase of two-coordinated nitrogen vacancies generated in g-C 3 N 4 .Therefore, with the combined XPS, elemental analysis, and EPR results, the generation of tunable nitrogen vacancies confined in g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets has been confirmed (Figure 3d). Evaluation of Photocatalytic Performance over g-C 3 N 4 with Tunable Nitrogen Vacancies.To explore the relationship between the density of nitrogen vacancies in g-C 3 N 4 and the photocatalytic activity, photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 and H 2 evolution reaction were conducted.As shown in Figure 4a, CO 2 can be reduced to CO by water vapor over both BCN and CN-x photocatalysts, because the CB edge of BCN and CN-x is at around -1.1 eV (vs normal hydrogen electrode, NHE), which is more negative than E(CO/CO 2 ) (CO 2 2e - 2H CO H 2 O, Er edox -0.53V vs NHE).It is obvious that the CO evolution rate gradually increases with the increase of nitrogen vacancies from BCN to CN-525.The highest CO evolution rate of 6.21 mol h -1 was obtained over CN-525, which is almost 4.2 times that over BCN (1.48 mol h -1 ).On the basis of such a comparison, our optimized CN-525 sample displays superior activity as compared to other carbon nitride catalysts under similar conditions (Table S1).Abundant lone pair electrons trapped in nitrogen vacancies as indicated in EPR spectra may benefit the CO 2 activation to generate CO 2 intermediate and promote the photoreduction of CO 2 to CO.However, an overincrease of nitrogen vacancies leads to a slight deterioration of CO evolution rate (4.5 mol h -1 ).It can be concluded that the nitrogen vacancies in optimum range of concentration have a positive correlation with the photocatalytic activity.The CO 2 reduction experiment performed in the dark or in the absence of the photocatalyst did not produce CO, proving that CO 2 reduction reaction is driven by light with the photocatalysts.Control experiments under UV-visible light irradiation were also performed over samples in Ar atmosphere.In the absence of CO 2 , neither CO nor other carbon compounds were detected, indicating that there was no residual carbon or other carbon contamination in the system. Splitting water into H 2 under visible light irradiation ( 420 nm) was also conducted with 3 wt Pt as the cocatalyst in a water/triethanolamine solution to evaluate the effect of tunable nitrogen vacancies on photocatalysis (Figure 4b).It is obvious that the H 2 evolution rate also shows the same trend as the CO evolution rate, which confirms that the introduction of vacancies enhances the photocatalytic activity, but it should be controlled in an appropriate range.CN-525 achieves the highest H 2 evolution rate of 64.39 mol h -1 , which is around 18 times that over BCN.Consistent with the trend in CO 2 reduction, a further increase of nitrogen vacancies in CN-550 leads to lowering the H 2 evolution rate to 55.64 mol h -1 .The H 2 evolution rate of all samples displays no obvious decrease after three consecutive runs (Figure 4c), indicating good stability and reusability of photocatalysts against photocorrosion.Wavelength-dependent H 2 evolution reveals the activity of CN-525 matches its optical absorption spectrum (Figure 4d), thus suggesting that the H 2 production is primarily driven by photoinduced electrons in g-C 3 N 4 .The calculated apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of CN-525 is 4.2 at 420 nm. Mechanistic Insights of the Influence of Tunable Nitrogen Vacancies on Photocatalysis.The photocatalytic efficiency is usually determined by the balance of thermodynamics and kinetics of light-harvesting processes, charge transport and separation processes, and catalytic reaction processes.Therefore, we explore the effect of tunable nitrogen vacancies on photocatalysis from these aspects. Analysis of Light-Harvesting and Band Structure.As compared to BCN, g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets with nitrogen vacancies exhibit extended visible light absorption with wide shoulder tail (Urbach tail), and the edge of the Urbach tail gradually redshifts in the visible light range when increasing the density of nitrogen vacancies, as evidenced by the changing color of the samples from light yellow to yellow-brown (Figure 5a).Usually, the Urbach tail is attributed to the electronic states located within the band gap (known as midgap states). 62The electronic structure of g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets with nitrogen vacancies was studied using periodic density functional theory (DFT) (Figure 5b).The band gap of pristine g-C 3 N 4 calculated by the generalized gradient approximation (GGA 49 ) in the scheme of Perdew-Bueke-Ernzerh (PBE 50 ) function is 1.03 eV, which is much smaller than the experimental value (2.7 eV), due to the well-known limitation of DFT. 53,63As compared to the calculated local partial density of states (PDOS) of BCN, new midgap states appear near the bottom of conductive band (CB) in g-C 3 N 4 with nitrogen vacancies.It is theoretically revealed that the loss of nitrogen atoms in -conjugated aromatic rings of g-C 3 N 4 results in the reconstruction of band structure. To acquire the position of midgap states, the band gap (E g ) energies of all of the samples were transformed from the absorption spectra with the Kubelk-Munk method (Figure S4).There is no obvious difference in the band gap energy of all of the heat-treated CN-x samples from that of the pristine BCN sample of around 2.7 eV.The band tails of the midgap states can be estimated to a first approximation by plotting the absorption edge data using eq 2 originally given by Urbach, 64 which is expressed as where is absorption coefficient, 0 is a constant, h is the incident photon energy, and Eu denotes the energy of the band tail or sometimes called the Urbach energy.The inset of Figure S4 shows Urbach plots of all samples.The Eu values were calculated from the inverse of the slope of Ln versus h.The Eu values gradually increase from 0.18 to 0.844 eV with more abundant nitrogen vacancies, which is consistent with UVvisible absorption spectra.It is expected that the midgap states of BCN originated from the defects in g-C 3 N 4 .Combined with the unchanged VB position from XPS valence band spectra (Figure S3b), the band edge of midgap states could be approximately determined and is shown in Figure 6.As the midgap states are close to the edge of CB, the electrons can be more easily excited from VB to midgap states.As shown in Figure 4d, CN-525 also exhibits AQE of 1.26 at 460 nm, 0.62 at 500 nm, and 0.25 at 550 nm, but BCN is inactive under irradiation of phones with wavelengths longer than 460 nm, revealing that photons with longer wavelengths could excite electrons into midgap states of CN-525 for enhanced H 2 evolution.On the basis of the above results, it is found that increasing nitrogen vacancies in g-C 3 N 4 induced the formation of deeper midgap states to accommodate more charge carriers excited by photons of longer wavelengths. Charge Separation and Transportation.To prove the positive impact of nitrogen vacancies on separation and transportation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs under irradiation, the periodic on/off photocurrent response was measured over the samples deposited on ITO electrode (Figure 7a).Photoanodes coated with CN-x display significant enhancement in photocurrent response as compared to BCN.The photocurrents increase along with the increase of nitrogen vacancies from CN-475 to CN-525, indicating that more photogenerated electrons in g-C 3 N 4 transfer to the collecting electrode.However, further increase of nitrogen vacancies in CN-550 leads to decrease of the photocurrent, probably due to overintroduction of nitrogen vacancies acting as recombination sites.The charge separation efficiency was also investigated by photoluminescence spectra (PL) at an excitation wavelength of 390 nm (Figure 7b). 6566667 The PL intensity decreases with the increasing nitrogen vacancies from CN-475 to CN-525, which indicates the reduced recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs in comparison to BCN.Such observation implies that the midgap states caused by nitrogen vacancies might be the sites for trapping photogenerated electrons, and increasingly deeper midgap states accelerate the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs.However, a further increase of nitrogen vacancies leads to the enhancement of PL intensity (CN-550).In this case, the deeper midgap states below CB could not only trap photogenerated electrons, but also serve as sites for trapping photogenerated holes, and then become recombination sites of photogenerated electron-hole pairs.This also could explain the reason for the decreased photocurrent response of CN-550 with the enhanced light absorption.Moreover, CN-525 shows a much smaller diameter of the semicircular Nyquist curve of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) under visible light radiation than that of BCN (Figure S5), implying smaller charge transfer resistance and higher separation efficiency of photogenerated electronhole pairs.Therefore, the increase of nitrogen vacancies in g-C 3 N 4 leads to the gradual enhancement of light-harvesting and charge transport and separation, and subsequently the increase of photocatalytic activity from CN to CN-525.However, overintroduction of nitrogen vacancies could generate the deeper midgap states that act as recombination sites, which results in a deterioration of photocatalytic performance for CN-550.It is revealed that the balance of light-harvesting and charge separation and transportation by introducing an appropriate density of nitrogen vacancies is important for optimizing the photocatalytic performance. Catalytic Reaction Sites.The dispersion state of Pt cocatalyst on CN-525 was studied by TEM analysis after photocatalytic reaction.It is clearly observed that small Pt nanoparticles (appearing as dark spots) are well dispersed on g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets, especially populated near the edges of the inplane holes (Figure 8a,b), which reduce the opportunity for the aggregation of Pt nanoparticles.The average diameter of these nanoparticles was estimated to be 1.2 nm based on the counting of around 100 particles (Figure 8c).It is speculated that the unpaired electrons within -conjugated aromatic rings on g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets resulted from nitrogen vacancies can effectively reduce the adsorbed PtCl 6 2-ions from the aqueous solution to form small Pt nanoparticles.Furthermore, nitrogen vacancies may stabilize these small particles on g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets in a highly dispersed manner. 68As single-atom heterogeneous catalysts have received considerable attention recently, generating vacancies on nanomaterials could be one of the effective methods to be explored for synthesizing singleatom heterogeneous catalysts. 69The high-resolution TEM image (Figure 8d) reveals well-defined lattice fringes with an interplanar spacing of 0.226 nm, corresponding to the (111) plane of metallic Pt.Such observations show that nitrogen vacancies benefit the binding and dispersion of cocatalyst (Pt) on g-C 3 N 4 and facilitate electron transfer to Pt.Therefore, nitrogen vacancies confined on g-C 3 N 4 could serve as active sites to trap electrons and uniformly bind Pt nanoparticles on g-C 3 N 4 , thus improving the photocatalytic activities for H 2 evolution and CO 2 reduction. On the basis of the above results, the mechanism of nitrogen vacancies on promoting the photocatalytic performance is proposed.As shown in Figure 9, the nitrogen vacancies confined in g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets generate midgap states below the conduction band edge, and the position of midgap state becomes deeper with the increase of vacancy density.Under light irradiation, electrons in g-C 3 N 4 can not only be excited into conduction band, but also to the midgap states by absorbing visible light with longer wavelengths (path 1).The wavelengths of absorbed light gradually become longer with the formation of deeper midgap states, which can excite more electron-hole pairs.Subsequently, the midgap states can also temporarily trap the excited electrons in CB to accelerate the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs (path 2).However, the deeper midgap states induced by overintroduction of nitrogen vacancies could become recombination sites of photogenerated electron-hole pairs (path 3).Finally, the excited electrons are transferred to Pt nanoparticles uniformly dispersed on g-C 3 N 4 to take part in the chemical reactions (path 4).At the optimized nitrogen vacancy density, paths 1, 2, and 4 favorably lead to the remarkably enhanced photocatalytic activity."
