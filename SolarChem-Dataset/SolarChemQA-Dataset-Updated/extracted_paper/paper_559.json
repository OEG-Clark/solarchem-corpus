    "content": "Photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 into hydrocarbon fuels using semiconductor photocatalysts has attracted great attention, which is considered as a promising approach to resolve the energy shortage and greenhouse effect.In this work, ordered mesoporous g-C 3 N 4 (mpg-C 3 N 4 ) nanosheets supported CdIn 2 S 4 nanocomposites were successfully fabricated by a hard-template combinated with hydrothermal method.The hybrids showed highly efficient photocatalytic activities for the reduction of CO 2 to CH 3 OH under visible-light irradiation.The optimized CdIn 2 S 4 /mpg-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst exhibited a high CH 3 OHproduction rate of 42.7 mol g -1 h -1 at a mpg-C 3 N 4 content of 20 wt.This rate was 1.8 times higher than that of pure CdIn 2 S 4 .The significant enhancement of photocatalystic activity was mainly ascribed to the increased CO 2 adsorption capacity and the improved separation and transfer of photogenerated electron-hole pairs at the intimate interface of CdIn 2 S 4 /mpg-C 3 N 4 heterojunctions.Furthermore, the hybrid photocatalysts displayed excellent stability under visible-light.A possible mechanism of enhanced photocatalytic activity of CdIn 2 S 4 /mpg-C 3 N 4 composite on photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 was also proposed.This work may provide some useful information for the future design and practical application of multifunctional hybrid photocatalysts in photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 ."

    "content": "Cadmium chloride (CdCl 2 2.5H 2 O), Indium chloride tetrahydrate (InCl 3 4H 2 O), and thioacetamide (TAA) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd (Shanghai, China).Mesoporous silica SBA-15 (S BET 800 m 2 g -1 ) was purchased from Tanlian Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China).Cyanamide was obtained from Aladdin Reagent Co. Ltd (Shanghai, China).All of the chemical reagents were of analytical grade and used without further purification. Ordered mesoporous g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets were prepared by using SBA-15 as a hard-template and cyanamide as a precursor.Firstly, 1.0 g SBA-15 was acidified by dilute HCl (1 M) at 80 C for 24 h and then centrifugated, washed with water and ethanol several times, and dried at 60 C. Secondly, 1.0 g of the acidified SBA-15 was immersed in 16.0 g cyanamide (50 wt) aqueous solution and kept stirring at 80 C for 6 h.Then, the resultant mixture was centrifuged, dried and finally calcined at 550 C for 4 h.The obtained powder was etched with 10 wt HF for 48 h to remove the silica template.The light yellow g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets were collected by centrifugation, washed with water and ethanol several times, and dried at 80 C. For comparison, bulk g-C 3 N 4 with Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of 7.4 m 2 g -1 was also prepared by a method described previously 39. The CdIn 2 S 4 /mpg-C 3 N 4 composites were prepared by a hydrothermal method.In detail, 0.57 g CdCl 2 2.5H 2 O, 1.46 g InCl 3 4H 2 O and 0.75 g TAA were dissolved in 30 mL deionized water to form a transparent suspension.Meanwhile, an appropriate amount of as-prepared mpg-C 3 N 4 was dispersed in 15 mL deionized water by ultrasound for 1 h.Then, the obtained mpg-C 3 N 4 suspension was added into the above solution under magnetic stirring.After being ultrasonicated for 3 h, the mixture was transferred to a 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and maintained at 160 C for 16 h.The final products were washed with ethanol and distilled water, and dried at 60 C for 10 h.The as-synthesized CdIn 2 S 4 /mpg-C 3 N 4 sample with 10 wt, 20 wt and 30 wt mpg-C 3 N 4 was labeled as CISCN10, CISCN20 and CISCN30, respectively.Pure CdIn 2 S 4 was also prepared using the same hydrothermal method in the absence of mpg-C 3 N 4 . The crystal structure of the samples was investigated by an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, D/MAX-2550, 0.15418 nm) with Cu K radiation.The morphology of the samples was measured by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JSM-6700F) with an energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrometer, transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL 200CX) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEM-2010F).The elemental mapping was performed on field-emission transmission electron microscope (JEM-2100F).X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on a PHI ESCA-5000C electron spectrometer.FT-IR spectra were recorded at room temperature using a FT-IR spectrophotometer (AVATAR3700).N 2 adsorptiondesorption and CO 2 adsorption isotherms were measured on Micromeritics ASAP2020 equipment.Elemental analyses of carbon and nitrogen contents were performed using a Vario Elcube CHN analyzer.UV-vis absorption spectra were analyzed by a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Hitachi U-3010) with a wavelength range of 200-800 nm.The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the photocatalyst were measured using a Hitachi F-7000 fluorescence spectrophotometer at room temperature. The photocurrent responses of the samples were measured by using a CHI660E electrochemical workstation (Chenhua Instrument Co., Ltd, Shanghai, China) with a standard three-electrode system.In the system, Pt wire was adopted as the counter electrode, Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) as the reference electrode and as-prepared photocatalysts as the working electrode.A 0.5 M Na 2 SO 4 aqueous solution was used as the electrolyte.The visible light was provided by a 300 W xenon arc lamp with a UV-cut off filter ( 420 nm).The working electrode was prepared as follows: 10 mg of the prepared photocatalyst was ground with 20 L of a poly(3,4ethylenedioxythiophene)/poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDO/TPSS, 1.3- 1.7) aqueous solution and 100 L of distilled water to make a slurry.The slurry was then spread on a 2.0 cm 1.5 cm F-doped SnO 2 (FTO) glass substrate with an active area of about 0.4 cm 2 by the doctor-blade method, using adhesive tape as the space.Finally, the working electrode was dried at 50 C for 30 min. The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 experiment was conducted in a continuous-flow reactor system equipped with a 300 W xenon lamp combined with a 420 nm cut-off filter as a light source.All experiments were performed at room temperature.In each run, 0.1 g photocatalyst was dispersed in 100 mL aqueous solution containing 0.1 M NaOH.To prevent the reactor being interfered with outside light, the system was covered by tinfoil.Before irradiation, ultrapure CO 2 (99.995) was bubbled through the reactor for 30 min to eliminate dissolved oxygen and saturate the solution.Then, the suspension was exposed to visible-light irradiation under magnetic stirring.Ultrapure CO 2 was continuously bubbled through the above solution in the reactor during the whole irradiation.At given time intervals, about 1 mL suspensions were collected and centrifuged to remove the photocatalyst particles.The products in the solution were analyzed using a GC7900 gas chromatography equipped with a FID detector and a capillary column (TM-PLOT U, 30 m 0.53 mm 20 m). The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) for reduction of CO 2 was calculated by measuring the CH 3 OH production amount under the same photocatalytic reaction conditions, only with a band-pass filter of 420 nm.The average intensity of irradiation was measured as 15.0 mW cm -2 (PL-MW2000 spectro-radiometer) and the irradiation area was controlled at 28.26 cm 2 .The AQE was calculated according to following equation: where R CH3OH and I represent the CH 3 OH evolution rate at 420 nm (molecules h -1 ), and the rate of absorption of incident photons, respectively."

    "content": "The XRD patterns of the pure CdIn 2 S 4 , mpg-C 3 N 4 , and CdIn 2 S 4 /mpg-C 3 N 4 composites with different mass ratios are shown in Fig. 1.The pure mpg-C 3 N 4 exhibits an intense diffraction peak located at 27.5 and a weak peak at 13.3 In the FT-IR spectrum of mpg-C 3 N 4 , the broad peak at 3250 cm -1 is ascribed to the stretching mode of the N H bond 30,31.The absorbed peaks at 1240, 1320, 1410, 1460 and 1575 cm -1 are related to the typical stretching vibration of C N heterocycles 30,31.The peak at 1640 cm -1 is associated with C N stretching vibration modes 30,31.The characteristic peak at 812 cm -1 is due to the vibration of triazine ring 30,31.All the main absorption bands of mpg-C 3 N 4 and CdIn 2 S 4 are also observed in CISCN20 composites, it obviously demonstrating that the composite is composed of mpg-C 3 N 4 and CdIn 2 S 4 . The morphology observation and microstructure analysis were carried on scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM).Fig. 3a clearly shows that pristine CdIn 2 S 4 has microsphere morphology with a diameter of about 1.6 m.Further observation show that individual CdIn 2 S 4 microsphere are built by numerous nanosheets.The pure mpg-C 3 N 4 displays a two-dimensional (2D) layered structure (Fig. 3b), and a highmagnification TEM image recorded along the (110) direction shown in Fig. 3c reveals that they have ordered mesostructures, which is similar to the mesochannels of SBA-15 40.The corresponding pore diameter of nanochannels is calculated as about 3.9 nm.After hybridization with mpg-C 3 N 4 , the CdIn 2 S 4 microspheres are unfolded and distributed uniformly as nanosheets on the surface of mpg-C 3 N 4 nanosheets to form a 2D sheet-on-sheet structure (Fig. 3d).The 2D sheet-on-sheet composite structure offers the maximum contact area between two components (CdIn 2 S 4 and mpg-C 3 N 4 nanosheets), which will facilitate the transfer of photogenerated carriers and improve the photocatalytic performance.The HRTEM image of CISCN20 shown in Fig. 3e reveals two different kinds of lattice fringes about 0.384 and 0.323 nm, which are 31,41,42.The N 1s spectrum of mpg-C 3 N 4 (Fig. 5c) can be divided into three peaks centered at 398.1, 399.5 and 400.9 eV, corresponding to the nitrogen atoms in the aromatic rings (C N C), tertiary nitrogen (N (C) 3 ) and amino functional groups having a hydrogen atom (C N H), respectively 41424344.In comparison with bare mpg-C 3 N 4 , the negative shift of the C 1s peaks and positive shift of N 1s peaks are observed for the CISCN20 sample.The shift in binding energy suggests an electronic interaction between CdIn 2 S 4 and mpg-C 3 N 4 45,46.The main binding energy peaks located at 411.8 eV (Cd 3d 5/2 ), 405.0 eV (Cd 3d 3/2 ), 451.7 eV (In 3d 3/2 ), 444.6 eV (In 3d 5/2 ), 161.2 eV (S 2p 3/2 ) and 162.3 eV (S 2p 1/2 ) can be observed from the high resolution spectra of the pristine CdIn 2 S 4 in Fig. 5d-f, respectively, indicating that the valence states of Cd, In and S are 2, 3 and -2, respec- tively 474849.After mpg-C 3 N 4 is introduced, the peaks of Cd 3d, In 3d and S 2p shift slightly toward lower binding energies compared to those of CdIn 2 S 4 , implying that the binding energies of the core level electrons of those metal and sulfide ions are affected due to the possible chemical bonding actions among the composite components. The carbon and nitrogen stoichiometry of the pristine mpg-C 3 N 4 was determined by elemental analysis.The C/N ratio of mpg-C 3 N 4 is 0.73, slightly lower than the theoretical value of 0.75 for C 3 N 4 , which might result from the existence of un-condensed amino groups that bound to the edges of graphene-like C N sheets 50. The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (Fig. 6a) show the optical properties of CdIn 2 S 4 /mpg-C 3 N 4 composites with different weight ratios of mpg-C 3 N 4 , together with mpg-C 3 N 4 and CdIn 2 S 4 .Pure mpg-C 3 N 4 has an absorption edge at about 460 nm.For pristine CdIn 2 S 4 , the absorption edge is about 560 nm, exhibiting the broad absorption region of visible-light.Compared with pure mpg-C 3 N 4 , the absorption edges of CdIn 2 S 4 /mpg-C 3 N 4 composites exhibit obvious red shift.This observation may be attributed to the interaction between mpg-C 3 N 4 and CdIn 2 S 4 in the composites 41,48.The band gap (E g ) can be determined by the formula: h A(h -E g ) n/2 , in which , h, and A are the absorption coefficient, Planck constant, the light frequency, and a constant, respectively.The value of n depends on the type of optical transition of the semiconductor (n 1 for direct transition and n 4 for indirect transition).As reported by the previous literatures, the n value of mpg-C 3 N 4 and CdIn 2 S 4 was 1 19,51.From the plot of ( h ) 2 versus (h ) in Fig. 6b, the E g of mpg-C 3 N 4 and CdIn 2 S 4 were estimated to be 2.70 eV and 2.32 eV, respectively, close to the values reported in the literatures 21,52,53.The E g values of the binary nanohybrids are located between that of mpg-C 3 N 4 and CdIn 2 S 4 and vary inversely with CdIn 2 S 4 content. The band edge position of a semiconductor at the point of zero charge can be calculated by using the following empirical equations 33,36,37: where E VB represents valence band (VB) edge potential, X is the electronegativity of the semiconductor estimated by the geometric mean of the electronegativity of the constituent atoms, E e is the energy of free electrons on the hydrogen scale (4.5 eV), E CB is the conduction band (CB) edge potential.The X value of pure CdIn 2 S 4 and mpg-C 3 N 4 is about 4.84 and 4.63 eV.The E VB of bare CdIn 2 S 4 and mpg-C 3 N 4 can be assigned to be 1.50 and 1.48 eV, respectively, and the corresponding E CB of CdIn 2 S 4 and mpg-C 3 N 4 can be estimated to be -0.82 and -1.22 eV, respectively.The N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms and Barrett-Joyner-Halenda pore size distributions of the CdIn 2 S 4 , mpg-C 3 N 4 and CISCN20 samples are shown in Fig. 7.As shown in Fig. 7a, all the samples show type-IV isotherms with a H3 hysteresis loop, indicating the existence of mesopores 54,55.From Fig. 7b, it can be seen that pristine mpg-C 3 N 4 has a narrow pore size distribution and the main pore size of this sample is about 3.87 nm, which is consistent with the TEM observation.The most probable mesoporous diameter of pristine CdIn 2 S 4 is about 3.89 nm.The CISCN20 sample has a broad pore size distribution compared to the pristine mpg-C 3 N 4 and CdIn 2 S 4 .Based on the desorption curve, the BET surface area of CISCN20 is calculated to be 90.3 m 2 g -1 , which is lower than that of pure mpg-C 3 N 4 (315.3m 2 g -1 ) but is higher than that of pure CdIn 2 S 4 (28.1 m 2 g -1 ). Fig. 8 shows the CO 2 -adsorption behavior of the mpg-C 3 N 4 , CISCN20 and CdIn 2 S 4 samples at 298 K.It can be seen that the order of the adsorption capacity of these photocatalysts for CO 2 is nearly in agreement with the order of the surface area of these samples.That is, the larger the surface area of sample, the higher its adsorption capacity for CO 2 is.The maximum CO 2 uptake for the mpg-C 3 N 4 , CISCN20 and CdIn 2 S 4 samples are 1.56 cm 3 g -1 , 1.38 cm 3 g -1 and 1.03 cm 3 g -1 , respectively.The comparison of the CO 2 -adsorption behavior of the above three samples indicates that the CdIn 2 S 4 /mpg-C 3 N 4 composite shows a superior CO 2 uptake ability than that of CdIn 2 S 4 , which will be beneficial for photoreduction of CO 2 . The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O over assynthesized samples was carried under visible-light ( 420 nm) irradiation.Fig. 9a shows the original chromatograms for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 on sample CdIn 2 S 4 and CISCN20.Only CH 3 OH is detected as a product using CdIn 2 S 4 or the CdIn 2 S 4 /mpg-C 3 N 4 composites as photocatalysts, which is in line with the previous published work that CH 3 OH is the main reduction product in aqueous CO 2 photoreduction systems 565758596061626364.Control experiments indicated no appreciable reduction products were detected without either the photocatalyst or visible-light, which demonstrates both photocatalyst and visible-light are necessary for CO 2 reduction.Fig. 9b andc shows the comparison of photocatalytic production rates of CH 3 OH over as-synthesized samples.It can be seen the pristine mpg-C 3 N 4 is not active for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction due to the fast recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs in the pure mpg-C 3 N 4 .The bare CdIn 2 S 4 without mpg-C 3 N 4 exhibits a low photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction, in which the CH 3 OH production rate is only 23.1 mol h -1 g -1 (Table 1).After coupling with mpg-C 3 N 4 , the photocatalytic activity of CdIn 2 S 4 is significantly enhanced.The photocatalytic CH 3 OH-production rate of the CdIn 2 S 4 /mpg-C 3 N 4 composites shows a tendency to increase with increasing mpg-C 3 N 4 content, achieving a maximum of 42.7 mol g -1 h -1 (with a 0.14 apparent quantum efficiency at 420 nm) at a mpg-C 3 N 4 content of 20 wt.This value is about 1.8 times higher than that of pure CdIn 2 S 4 .However, a further increase in the content of mpg-C 3 N 4 leads to a reduction in the photocatalytic CH 3 OH-production rate.This can probably be ascribed to the following factors: (i) exces- 12).Thus, a suitable content of mpg-C 3 N 4 is crucial for optimizing the photocatalytic activity of CdIn 2 S 4 /mpg-C 3 N 4 composites.Additionally, the photocatalytic CH 3 OH-production activity of the CISCN20 sample is also higher than the various photocatalysts reported previously, such as Ag/TiO 2 56, FeTiO 3 /TiO 2 57, BiVO 4 58, Bi 2 WO 6 hollow microspheres 59, CdS (Bi 2 S 3 )/TiO 2 nanotubes 60, NiO x -Ta 2 O 5 -rGO 61, NaBiO 3 62, Pt-g-C 3 N 4 63, S-g-C 3 N 4 64 and so on.From Fig. 9 and Table 1, it also can be found that the photocatalytic activity of CdIn 2 S 4 /20mpg-C 3 N 4 composite is higher than that of CdIn 2 S 4 /20bulk-C 3 N 4 (labeled as CISBCN20).This acceleration mainly comes from the following reasons.Firstly, CdIn 2 S 4 /20mpg-C 3 N 4 possesses larger specific surface area than CdIn 2 S 4 /20bulk-C 3 N 4 .The increased specific surface area can supply more active sites and adsorption sites, leading to the enhancement in photocatalytic rate.Secondly, the mesoporous structure of CdIn 2 S 4 /20mpg-C 3 N 4 can in principle enhance the light harvesting ability due to multiple scattering effects 65, which is also beneficial to the photocatalytic performance. To reveal the stability of as-synthesized CdIn 2 S 4 /mpg-C 3 N 4 composites, the cycling photocatalytic CO 2 reduction experiment was performed over CISCN20 under the same conditions.As shown in Fig. 10, the CdIn 2 S 4 /mpg-C 3 N 4 composite maintains a similar level of reactivity after four runs of experiments.The slight decrease may originate from the inescapable loss of catalyst during the recycling runs.The structure of the CISCN20 sample before and after four consecutive cycles was also recorded by XRD.As shown in Fig. 11, no apparent change in the crystalline structure is observed before and after the reaction.These results indicate that the higher surface area of the hybrid, which should also be responsible for the enhancement of photocatalytic activity.On the basis of the above results, the photocatalytic mechanism for the CdIn 2 S 4 /mpg-C 3 N 4 composites is tentatively proposed and schematically illustrated in Fig. 14.Under the irradiation of the visible-light, both mpg-C 3 N 4 and CdIn 2 S 4 can be excited and pro- duce photogenerated electron-hole pairs.Because the CB position of CdIn 2 S 4 (-0.82eV) is lower than that of mpg-C 3 N 4 (-1.22 eV), and the VB position of mpg-C 3 N 4 (1.48 eV) is higher than that of CdIn 2 S 4 (1.50 eV), the photogenerated electrons in CB of mpg-C 3 N 4 transfer easily to CdIn 2 S 4 , whereas photogenerated holes in VB of CdIn 2 S 4 migrate to the surface of mpg-C 3 N 4 .Thus, the recombination process of the electron-hole pairs is effectively inhibited, resulting in obviously improvement of photocatalytic activity for CdIn 2 S 4 /mpg-C 3 N 4 composites.In the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, the active valence band holes can oxidize H 2 O to produce OH, which can release O 2 and H 66.Then, H and the CB electrons would reduce CO 2 to CH 3 OH 66."

    "content": "In summary, the mesoporous g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets supported CdIn 2 S 4 nanocomposites with different mpg-C 3 N 4 contents have been prepared successfully through a hard-template combinated with hydrothermal method.The obtained CdIn 2 S 4 /mpg-C 3 N 4 composites exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity in the photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O to methanol under visible-light irradiation.The optimal mpg-C 3 N 4 content was determined to be 20 wt and the corresponding CH 3 OH-production rate was 42.7 mol g -1 h -1 , which was 1.8 times higher than that of pure CdIn 2 S 4 .Moreover, the composite photocatalysts showed excellent durability during the recycling performance.The enhanced photocatalytic activity of the composites was mainly ascribed to the synergistic effects of the increased adsorption capacity toward CO 2 as well as the effective separation of electron-hole pairs at the interface of the heterojunction.This work will provide a new direction to design efficient photocatalysts for CO 2 photocatalytic reduction into hydrocarbon fuels.
