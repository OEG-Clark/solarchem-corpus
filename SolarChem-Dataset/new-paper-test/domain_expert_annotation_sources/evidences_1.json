Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was utilized to observe the morphological attributes of the CQDs (Figure 1b), CN (Figure 1e), and the synthesized 0D/2D CQD/CN heterojunction (Figure 1h).Importantly, these TEM images unveil the monodis-perse nature of the CQDs, exhibiting a diameter close to 1.5 nm.Meanwhile, both CN and CQD/CN manifest themselves as thin sheets.A notable observation is the well-dispersed arrangement of CQDs on their surface of CQD/CN, highlighting the successful integration of CQDs with CN.In-depth analysis through highresolution TEM (HRTEM) reveals a crystallite plane spacing of 0.21 nm in CQDs (Figure 1c), being consistent with the characteristic (100) spacing of graphitic carbon. 25Furthermore, the discernible diffraction fringe of 0.32 nm (Figure 1f) corresponds to the (002) crystal face of CN, indicative of the interlayer stacking within the conjugate aromatic series. 7Moreover, TEM image of CQD/CN nanosheets (Figure 1i) displays diffraction fringes corresponding to the (100) crystal faces of both CQDs (0.21 nm) and CN (0.69 nm), 26,27 providing well-defined evidence of the successful integration of CQDs into CN and the simultaneous formation of numerous tiny interface regions endowed with a rich interfacial electric field.In addition, energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) mapping imaging (Figure S1, Supporting Information) corroborates the uniform distribution of C, N, and a trace O elements within the CQD/CN structure.To ascertain the thickness of these samples, atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were conducted.The determined height range of CQDs falls between 1.0 and 1.5 nm (Figure 1d), corresponding to the thickness of three to four graphene layers.In contrast, bulk CN exhibits a thickness of up to 15 nm (Figure 1g).Surprisingly, CQD/CN presents an unexpected thickness of 2.0 nm (Figure 1j).Further insights are garnered from TEM images of the precursor (Figure S2, Supporting Information), indicating that the incorporation of CQDs in precursor results in a thinner synthesized products compared to the controlled sample without CQDs.This observation suggests a pivotal role for CQDs in regulating the precursor size, ultimately leading to the formation of ultrathin CQD/CN nanosheets.The ultrathin nanosheet architecture of CQD/CN endows it with an expansive specific surface area, providing abundant photocatalysis active sites. To validate the supposition, the N 2 adsorption-desorption measurements elucidating the pore structure and surface area of the materials are depicted in Figure 2a.Both CN and CQD/CN exhibit type-IV isotherms, as per the IUPAC categorization standard, accompanied by distinctive capillary condensation or evaporation steps, indicative of an orderly mesoporous structure. 28Notably, CQD/CN, identified as the mesoporous material, demonstrates a higher adsorption dV/dD pore volume and surface area than CN. 29This observation underscores the substantial increase in specific surface area of CQD/CN facilitated by the CQDs-induced hydrothermal-calcination tandem synthesis strategy.The existence of these porous structures can facilitate the adsorption of reactants, offering additional active sites for the photocatalysts, thus fortifying their photocatalysis capability. Crystal structure modifications were investigated using Xray diffraction (XRD) spectroscopy (Figure 2b).Both CN and CQDs/CN exhibit two distinct characteristic peaks, namely a peak (100) at 12.9and a peak (002) at 27.4, representing tristriazine duplication and interlayer stacking, respectively. 30In the case of CQDs, a peak (002) appears at 26.9, originating from the graphitic layer stack. 31Interestingly, the implantation of CQDs onto CN enhances the (002) diffraction peak strength of CQD/CN, signifying the effective integration of CQD and CN during the hydrothermal and calcination processes, attesting to the refined crystallinity and structural integrity achieved through this innovative synthesis approach. The FTIR spectra, presented in Figure S3 (Supporting Information), provide insights into the molecular composition of CQDs, CN, and CQD/CN.For CN and CQD/CN, the peak at 810 cm -1 corresponds to the out-of-plane bending mode of heptazine rings, while the collective peaks between 1200 and 1600 cm -1 delineate the stretching and bending modes of the CN conjugated heterocycles within the \"melon\" framework. 32Furthermore, the broad peaks in the 3000-3300 cm -1 range are correlated to amine group (NH) tensile vibrations. 7Concurrently, the infrared signal at 2233 cm -1 in CQDs is assigned to the stretching vibration of the cyano group (CN). 33he component and element characterization of CQDs, CN, and CQD/CN was further conducted using XPS spectra.The results of the XPS survey (Figure 2c) affirm the predominant presence of C and N elements, with a trace of O elements (Table S1, Supporting Information), consistent with EDX mapping observations.In the C 1s spectra of CQD/CN (Figure 2d), the binding energies at 284.8, 286.2, and 288.3 eV were assigned to graphitic carbon (CC/CC), 34 amino or cyano group (CNH/CN), 33 and sp 2 -hybridized carbon (NCN), 5 respectively.The N1s spectra (Figure 2e) of CN and CQD/CN revealed three peaks corresponding to sp 2 -hybridized N (NCN) (398.8 eV), sp 3 -hybridized N (N(C) 3 ) (400.4 eV), and amine functional groups (CNH) (401.3 eV), consistent with the heptazine-based architecture. 4In addition, the N 1s spectrum of CQDs could be fitted with pyridine N (398.5 eV), cyano N (399.1 eV), amino N (399.8eV), and graphitic N (400.7 eV). 353637 Moreover, weak XPS O 1s spectra (Figure S4, Supporting Information) in all samples indicate oxygen contamination in the environment. 21The combined XPS and FT-IR results indicate the various forms of nitrogen elements in CQDs, including graphitic N, amino N, cyano N, and pyridine N. The substantial N element doping (23.43) enriches CQDs with electrons, effectively improving the delocalized electron cloud density of CQDs. The electronic properties of the catalyst were characterized using EPR, as depicted in Figure 2f. 38All catalysts exhibited a distinct EPR signal peak at g 2.0035, proving the presence of de-localized electrons. 39Notably, CQDs exhibited the strongest EPR peaks, indicating the abundance of delocalized electrons in N-doped CQDs.Remarkably, the EPR signal of CQD/CN was 4.3 times higher than that of CN, attributing this enhancement to the ultrathin nanosheet structure of CQD/CN, which exposes more delocalized electrons.The integration of CQDs with CN results in an expanded -conjugate system.Therefore, CQDs embedded on the surface of CN disperse numerous \"high charge density points\", inducing a rich micro-region interface electric field.This naturally enhances the photoelectrochemical characteristics and catalytic activity of CQD/CN. A series of optical and electrochemical characterizations were employed to monitor the charge separation and transfer kinetics of photocatalysts.Under visible light radiation ( 420 nm), CQD/CN exhibited a higher transient photocurrent compared to CN (Figure S5, Supporting Information), indicating superior visible-light responsiveness and improved efficiency of charge separation in CQD/CN.The charge transfer resistance (Rct) of CQD/CN showed a significant reduction compared to CN, implying higher electron exchange efficiency on the surface of CQD/CN, as evidenced by the smaller EIS radius (Figure S6, Supporting Information). 40Moreover, the fluorescence intensity of CQD/CN was notably lower than that of CN (Figure S7, Supporting Information), signifying that the introduction of CQDs into CN effectively inhibits the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. 41Additionally, the decay kinetics of photogenerated carriers were predicted by fitting the time profiles of normalized transient absorption in the range of 365-1000 nm (Figure 2g; Table S2, Supporting Information).Compared to the average lifetime of pure CN (5.26 ns), the average lifetime of CQD/CN was measured at 8.41 ns, indicating efficient charge transfer and suppressed electron-hole recombination in the heterojunction. 42In situ EPR (Figure 2h) was employed to analyze the change of charge density of the CQD/CN heterojunction after illumination. 43The EPR signal of CQD/CN powder gradually increased as light radiation commenced, reached stability at 7 min.This indicates that intense electron-hole pair separation occurred in the catalyst after the photoexcitation, resulting in the gradual accumulation of unpaired electron concentration, maintaining dynamic equilibrium after reaching the maximum amount. The light absorption properties of the synthesized samples were investigated using UV-vis diffuse reflection spectroscopy (DRS, Figure 2i).In particular, the prepared CN displayed a distinct absorption edge at 600 nm, showcasing a significant redshift compared to the intrinsic absorption edge of classical graphite-phase CN (460 nm). 44This redshift suggests the activation of the n- transition through the hydrothermal calcination synthesis strategy. 45On the other hand, CQDs exhibited noticeable absorption across the entire visible region, indicative of their narrow bandgap.The integration of CQDs with CN in the heterojunction, denoted as CQD/CN, led to a substantial enhancement in visible light absorption, which is a favorable aspect for improving photocatalytic performance.Moreover, based on the Kubelka-Munk expression (Figure S8, Supporting Information), the calculated indirect bandgap values for CN and CQDs were determined to be 2.50 and 2.40 eV, respectively. 46nderstanding the energy band structures of semiconductors is crucial for delineating their oxidation-reduction capabilities and ultimately determining their charge separation efficiency.Mott-Schottky curves at different frequencies were carried out to clarify the conductive type and flat-band potential of the aforementioned samples (Figure S9, Supporting Information). 47oth CN and CQDs exhibited linear graphs with positive slopes, indicative of typical n-type semiconducting behavior and suggesting excellent electron conduction properties. 48Besides, the flat band potential of CN and CQDs was determined to be -0.31 and -0.57V (vs Ag/AgCl, pH 7), respectively.According to the band structure relationship, the conduction band/valence band (CB/VB) of CN and CQDs were confirmed as -0.31/1.33V and -0.57/0.75V (vs NHE, pH 7), respectively (Figure S10, Supporting Information). The photoreduction activity of the catalyst was systematically assessed in a gas-solid reaction system under visible light irradiation ( 420 nm).Control experiments (Figure 3a) were conducted without catalyst, light, or CO 2 .The results demonstrated the absence of reduction products under these conditions, affirming the indispensability of both light and catalyst in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction process.Importantly, it was confirmed that the reduction products originated from CO 2 rather than the self-decomposition of the catalyst.CO emerged as the primary reduction product, accompanied by a minor amount of methane (Figure S11, Supporting Information).Following 2.5 h of visible light exposure, pure CN and CQDs exhibited relatively low CO production, measuring 39.2 and 2.0 mol g -1 , respectively.Impressively, the photocatalytic activity of CQD/CN surpassed that of pure CN, achieving an average CO production rate of 120 mol g -1 , outperforming most other semiconductor photocatalytic materials reported for similar environments (Table S3, Supporting Information).In addition, CQD/CN demonstrated high CO selectivity (92.8) and exhibited superior operational stability, with no significant inactivation occurring over 10 h of continuous measurements (Figure 3b).To further verify the origin of the product, isotopically labeled 13 CO 2 experiments were carried out by mass spectrometry (Figure 3c).The results revealed a distinct and robust signal of 13 CO at m/z 29, confirming that the photocatalytic product CO originates from 13 CO 2 rather than the catalyst itself. The CO 2 -temperature-programmed desorption (CO 2 -TPD, Figure 3d) analysis was employed to explore the chemical adsorption capacity of the catalyst for CO 2 .The results revealed a distinct oxygen desorption peak at 350 C for CQD/CN, proving an abundance of basic sites with moderate strength on the catalyst surface. 49This characteristic not only facilitates the adsorption of CO 2 molecules but also aids in the desorption of photocatalytic products.Moreover, the strength of oxygen desorption peak in CQD/CN is significantly higher than that of pure CN.This is attributed to the ultra-thin morphology of CQD/CN, exposing more alkaline sites compared to CN, thereby contributing to superior photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity. Evolving species during photocatalyzed CO 2 reduction process by CQD/CN were monitored by in situ diffuse infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS).Positive peaks in the infrared spectrum were assigned to the accumulation of different intermediate species.In the initial 30 min of the dark reaction (Figure 3e), CQD/CN was exposed to a flowing CO 2 and H 2 O gas environment to ensure adsorption saturation.The gradual enhancement of CO 2 (2341 cm -1 ) and H 2 O (3230 cm -1 ) vibration signals on the surface of CQD/CN, 12,50 along with the emergence of multiple carbonate species, including m-CO 3 2 -(1510 cm -1 ), b-CO 3 2 -(1281 cm -1 ), and HCO 3 -(1434 cm -1 ), validates the effective adsorption and activation of raw material molecules by CQD/CN. 8 addition, the evolution of species adsorbed on the surface of CQD/CN during light irradiation was tracked (Figure 3f,g).The negative increase in the CO 2 signal indicates the consumption of CO 2 as a raw material in the photoreaction system.Peaks at 1230 and 1360 cm -1 were attributed to COOH, 51 a crucial intermediate species for converting CO 2 to CO or CH 4 .Furthermore, the peaks at 1097 cm -1 belong to CHO, and the peaks at 1158 and 2941 cm -1 belong to CH 3 O, which are important intermediates in the formation of CH 4 . 52,53The evolution of these intermediates in DRIFTS corroborates the effective photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 by CQD/CN.According to the above results, the CO 2 conversion process in the photocatalytic system can be summarized (Figure 3h).Initially, CO 2 molecules adsorbed on the surface of CQD/CN are reduced to COOH by photoelectrons, subsequently obtaining e -and protons to form CO.Moreover, 54 To monitor the charge transfer dynamics within CQD/CN heterojunction, in situ Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) was employed to record the surface potential of samples under dark and illumination conditions. 55The results illustrated that in the dark, the contact potential difference (CPD) between CN and the probe (Figure 4a, CPD 1 23 mV) was lower than the CPD between CQD/CN and the probe (Figure 4b, CPD 2 32 mV).This discrepancy implied an enhancement in surface charge density following the integration of CQDs.Importantly, as the environment transitioned from darkness to light, the CPD between CQD/CN and the probe (Figure 4c, CPD 3 41 mV) significantly exceeded CPD 2 by a notable margin.This observation suggested a heightened charge transfer between CN and CQDs in CQD/CN when exposed to light, facilitating the accumulation of charge on the surface.The nuanced interfacial charge transfer mechanisms between CN and CQDs were further elucidated through the calculation of the work function (WF) of the samples according to the formula WF (eV) WF probe e CPD (Figure S12, Supporting Information, for details). 56After determining the WF value, it became evident that the Fermi level (E F ) of CQD/CN was higher than that of pure CN (Figure 4d), signifying the spontaneous transfer of electrons from CQDs to CN through the heterogeneous interface when CN and CQDs are in close contact.This transfer causes the E F of CQDs and CN to move down and up, respectively, until their E F reaches equilibrium. 57This transfer induced the generation of an interfacial electric field from CQDs to CN, manifesting in the bending of energy bands. 58This interfacial electric field acted as a robust driving force, orchestrating the swift combination of photogenerated electrons at CB of CN with the holes at VB of CQDs. 59This intricate interplay resulted in the directed accumulation of reduced photoelectrons in the micro-region of CQDs, finely tuned by the interfacial electric field, ultimately driving efficient CO 2 reduction to CO and CH 4 (Figure 4e). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out to elucidate the impact of introduced CQDs on the charge dynamics of CN. 60 Post-structural optimization, the calculated bandgap values for CQD, CN, and CQD/CN were determined to be 0.36, 1.35 (Figure S13, Supporting Information), and 0.34 eV (Figure 5a,b), respectively.These findings indicate that the integration of CQDs into CN results in a narrower bandgap in CQD/CN.In intricate detail, the interaction between the carbon ring and heptazine unit generates multiple intermediate energy levels above the VB, establishing a novel transmission path for long-wavelength visible light. 6In addition, the Gibbs free energy of the reaction unveils the active site of CO2 photoreduc-tion on samples (Figure S14, Supporting Information; Figure 5c).From a thermodynamic standpoint, it is conventionally recognized that COOH formation represents a rate-limiting step in the CO 2 reduction process. 51Calculations for each nitrogen site in the CQD/CN model reveal that bridging nitrogen on CN at the interface (site 6) and pyridine nitrogen at the edge of CQDs (site 2) exhibit low COOH generation energy.This indicates that embedding CN within CQDs introduces abundant active sites at the interface, consequently enhancing CO production."}]}}
