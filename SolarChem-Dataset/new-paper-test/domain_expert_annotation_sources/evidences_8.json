To determine the location of the generated O V , we employed DFT calculations to examine the O V formation energy (Figure 1h).The calculation results indicate a substantial decrease in the vacancy formation energy at the two neighboring coordinated O atoms upon introducing single Ru atoms, suggesting the probable formation of O V at these sites (Figure 1i).The density of states (DOS) calculations also indicate that Ru occupies the highest empty orbitals at the Fermi level, confirming the potential for accumulating photogenerated holes (Figure S5, Supporting Information).The introduction of Ru and O V causes a downward shift in the Ti-occupied states in the conduction band (CB), suggesting that photogenerated electrons will UV-vis diffuse reflection spectra (DRS) were employed to evaluate the photo-absorption ability of the photocatalysts (Figure S8a, Supporting Information).Both TiO 2 and Ru-O V /TiO 2 exhibited similar absorption edges at 400 nm with the same band gap of 3.28 eV (Figure S8b, Supporting Information), indicating that modifying Ru-O V sites has little effect on the light harvest, which is not the decisive reason for the improved photocatalytic performance.Moreover, tail adsorption exceeding 400 nm was observed on the Ru-O V /TiO 2 sample, similar to that reported on the vacancy-rich TiO 2 , 27,28 confirming the presence of abundant O V .Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy tests were conducted to investigate the effect of introducing Ru on the charge separation.In Figure S9 (Supporting Information), Ru-O V /TiO 2 exhibited a significantly reduced PL signal compared to pristine TiO 2 , demonstrating enhanced charge separation efficiency.The kinetics of photogenerated electron-hole pairs were assessed to elucidate the positive influence of introducing Ru-O V sites on enhancing photocatalytic efficiency.The transient photocurrent response indicates that constructing Ru-O V is beneficial for increasing the photocurrent intensity of TiO 2 , significantly improving the photogenerated charge transfer efficiency (Figure S10a, Supporting Information).Furthermore, the Nyquist plot of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) under illumination reveals that Ru-O V /TiO 2 presents reduced carrier separation and transfer impedance (Figure S10b, Supporting Information).Therefore, introducing Ru-O V facilitates forming highly separated electronhole states, which is beneficial for enhancing photocatalytic activity.Time-resolved PL spectroscopy further explained the effect of introducing Ru on the charge transfer dynamics (Figure 2h).The slower fluorescence decay of Ru-O V /TiO 2 (26.88 ns) compared to pristine TiO 2 (7.17 ns) implies a more efficient charge separation and transfer. 29,30Further experimental evidence was provided by the solid-state in situ EPR spectra under light irradiation, as illustrated in Figure 2i.For pristine TiO 2 , light irradiation only causes limited signal enhancement, which is attributed to severe charge recombination.However, the EPR signal of Ru-O V /TiO 2 increased by about two-fold under light irradiation, indicating that the Ru-O V site can suppress the charge recombination to enhance the concentration of spin electrons excited to the CB. 313233 In situ high-resolution XPS in the dark and under light irradiation was conducted to investigate the charge transfer direction.Under illumination, the Ti 2p and O 1s XPS peaks display negative and positive shifts, respectively, corresponding to the intrinsic photoexcitation process of TiO 2 (Figure 2j,k).It is worth noting that the binding energy of Ru 3p XPS displays a pos-itive shift, suggesting the accumulation of photogenerated holes at Ru sites, consistent with predictions from previous DFT calculations (Figure 2j).Therefore, these results demonstrate that Ru and its induced O V promote the directional separation of photogenerated charges, forming localized regions enriched with electrons and holes to facilitate CO 2 reduction and H 2 O activation. The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance of prepared catalysts was evaluated in a customized sealed quartz glass reactor under the irradiation of a 300 W Xe lamp.For each reaction, the system was evacuated and filled with CO 2 to adjust the pressure at 70 kPa, followed by adding 500 L of H 2 O as a proton source.Hence, gaseous products of CH 4 and CO were detected, with no detection of H 2 or any liquid-phase products (e.g., CH 3 OH, HCHO, HCOOH, etc.). Figure 3a,b illustrates the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance of the prepared samples.Pristine TiO 2 generates only trace amounts of CH 4 , where CO is the primary photocatalytic CO 2 reduction product, at a rate of 28.8 mol g -1 h -1 .Upon introducing Ru-O V sites, the CH 4 yield significantly increases, accompanied by a decrease in the CO yield.The CH 4 yield reaches its maximum when the Ru loading is 1.22 (50.1 mol g -1 h -1 ), displaying a remarkable increase of 195.4 times that of pristine TiO 2 , whereas the corresponding CO yield decreases to 38 of the pristine TiO 2 .Based on the average product content, the CH 4 selectivity of the optimized Ru-O V /TiO 2 sample is 81, signifying a radical transformation compared to the 1 CH 4 selectivity of TiO 2 (Figure 3c).The considerable changes in product selectivity suggest differences in the CO 2 reduction mechanism and active sites between Ru-O V /TiO 2 and pristine TiO 2 .Subjecting Ru-O V /TiO 2 to heat treatment at 300 C in the air to oxidize its surface OV (i.e., Ru-O V /TiO 2 -oxidized) resulted in a change in selectivity, with a significant decrease in the CH 4 yield accompanied by an increase in the CO yield (Figure 3d).Further heat treatment of the Ru-O V /TiO 2 -oxidized sample under a vacuum to restore its surface O V led to a recovery of its product selectivity toward CH 4 dominance.These observations indicate that O V is a critical factor in modulating product selectivity. Furthermore, the control experiments under other conditions were conducted to confirm the CO 2 photoreduction on Ru-O V /TiO 2 (Figure S11, Supporting Information).In the absence of light, catalysts, or CO 2 , no carbon-containing products can be detected, demonstrating that the observed products were generated from light-driven CO 2 reduction catalyzed by Ru-O V /TiO 2 .Moreover, without adding H 2 O in the reaction system, no products were detected, indicating that CO 2 reduction requires H 2 O as a proton source.Isotopic experiments with 13 CO 2 confirmed that the carbon-containing products were generated from the photoreduction of CO 2 molecules.When the reaction was conducted in a 13 CO 2 atmosphere, only 13 CO and 13 CH 4 were detected, as illustrated in Figure 3e.In addition to its remarkable photocatalytic activity, Ru-O V /TiO 2 has excellent stability.As depicted in Figure S12 (Supporting Information), no noticeable decrease in the activity for CO 2 photoreduction was observed in the cycling tests.The characteristics of Ru-O V /TiO 2 after the continuous reaction remain almost the same as those in the fresh samples (Figure S13, Supporting Information), confirming the excellent stability of the catalyst. The adsorption process of CO 2 on the surfaces was examined to investigate the mechanism of CO 2 photoreduction on Considering that introducing the Ru species reduces the specific surface area of TiO 2 (Figure S14, Supporting Information), we can infer that the two-fold increase in CO 2 adsorption on Ru-O V /TiO 2 surfaces stems from the presence of specific CO 2 adsorption sites.Then, in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) was applied to monitor the process of CO 2 adsorption dynamically on TiO 2 and Ru-O V /TiO 2 .Figure S15 (Supporting Information) displays the characteristic CO 2 adsorption band ( 3 (CO 2 )) with infrared peaks from 3592 to 3728 cm -1 , 34,35 where these intensity changes imply an excellent CO 2 adsorption capacity of the Ru-O V sites.The increased CO 2 adsorption capacity is critical for the photocatalytic reactions on the surface of Ru-O V /TiO 2 .The electron transfer process in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was evidented by using in situ XPS analysis.In Figure S16 (Supporting Information), under illumination, the Ti 2p binding energy shifted negatively by 0.19 eV, whereas the Ru 3p shifted positively by 0.21 eV, indicating the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes at Ru-O V sites.After introducing CO 2 into the system, the Ti 2p binding energy shifted positively by 0.13 eV, whereas the Ru 3p binding energy remained nearly unchanged, suggesting that the photogenerated electrons were transferred from Ti (adjacent to O V ) to CO 2 . An in situ DRIFTS analysis was conducted under reaction conditions to elucidate the structural evolution of the surfaceabsorbed species.Supplementary Table S1 (Supporting Informa-tion) lists the assignments of all band vibration peaks.As depicted in Figure 4a,e, the activation of CO 2 on the catalyst surface initially proceeds with the assistance of H 2 O molecules to generate carbonate species, encompassing three distinct types of characteristic peaks: chelating-bridged carbonate (c-CO 3 2-: 1765 cm -1 ), 36 bidentate carbonate (b-CO 3 2-, with asymmetric CO 3 stretching vibration at 1560 cm -1 and symmetric CO 3 stretching vibration at 1395 cm -1 ), 30,37,38 and monodentate carbonate (m-CO 3 2-: 1541 and 1522 cm -1 ). 39,40Comparing the intensity of the characteristic peaks explained the differences in the initial activation process of CO 2 on the surfaces of TiO 2 and Ru-O V /TiO 2 .Carbonate species on TiO 2 were predominantly present as m-CO 3 2-, confirming the single-point adsorption of CO 2 on individual Ti sites.Upon introducing Ru-O V sites, the characteristic peak of m-CO 3 2-significantly decreased while enhancing the characteristic peaks of b-CO 3 2-and c-CO 3 2-.This finding suggests that Ru-O V sites promote the bridging adsorption of CO 2 molecules, directly altering the reaction routes.The characteristic peak of c-CO 3 2-undergoes a pronounced increase followed by a decrease, indicating that CO 2 on Ru-O V sites has a faster reduction kinetic process.Further, bicarbonate HCO 3 -and formate intermediate COOH were observed, 414243 indicating that the transformation of bicarbonates to formate appears to follow the following route: CO 3 2- HCO 3 - COOH.The formed COOH tends to preserve the initial adsorption state of CO 2 .Therefore, after further hydrogenation and dehydration, CO on the TiO 2 surface desorbs to form CO (Figure 4b), whereas CO on the Ru-O V /TiO 2 surface remains stabilized on Ru-O V sites (Figure 4f). 25,44,45Additionally, vibrational peaks corresponding to CHO, CH 2 O, and CH 3 O were detected on Ru-O V /TiO 2 (Figure 4g), 46474849 which are absent on TiO 2 (Figure 4c 50 In Figure S17a (Supporting Information), the dissociation of D 2 O on TiO 2 leads to two characteristic Ti-OD peaks at 2338 cm -1 and 2373 cm -1 , indicating the dissociation of water molecules at Ti sites on pristine TiO 2 . 47,51In contrast, for Ru-O V /TiO 2 , the original Ti-OD peak intensity weakens, and new characteristic peaks attributed to Ru-OD occur (Figure S17b, Supporting Information), indicating that Ru sites on Ru-O V /TiO 2 are the primary active centers for water activation. 26ased on the preceding analysis, it is evident that CO species, derived from the hydrogenation of the COOH species, is the most crucial intermediate affecting the selectivity of the final products.Its desorption or further hydrogenation corresponds to the production of CO or CH 4 , respectively.Therefore, CO temperature programmed desorption (TPD) testing was conducted to confirm the influence of Ru-O V sites on CO adsorption.As depicted in Figure 4h, pristine TiO 2 has a CO desorption peak at 200 C.However, upon introducing Ru-O V sites, the CO desorption peak shifts to a higher temperature region (600 C), demonstrating the existence of more robust CO adsorption sites on the catalyst surface.The in situ DRIFTS analysis reveals that bridging the adsorption of CO is crucial to significantly improving adsorption stability, inferring that Ru-O V sites serve as the bridging adsorption sites for CO.Then, oxidation was performed on Ru-O V /TiO 2 to remove most of the O V .Under these conditions, the CO desorption peak returned to 200 C, indicating that the Ru sites without O V cannot enhance the adsorption strength of CO, strongly supporting the conclusion that Ru-O V serves as the bridging adsorption site for CO. To provide insights into the nature of the active sites for CO 2 photoreduction with H 2 O over the Ru-O V /TiO 2 catalyst, DFT calculations were conducted to investigate the reaction mechanism.Based on the experimental conclusion that the adjacent Ru-O V sites on the Ru-O V /TiO 2 surface serve as active reaction sites, a corresponding model was constructed to simulate the catalyst (Figure S18, Supporting Information).First, the influence of Ru-O V sites on the band structure was examined.Compared to the uniformly distributed valence band (VB) and CB of pristine TiO 2 (Figure S19, Supporting Information), the VB region of Ru-O V /TiO 2 was concentrated around the Ru sites, whereas the CB region was distributed around the O V sites (Figure 5a).Hence, upon photoexcitation of Ru-O V /TiO 2 , photogenerated electrons transition from the Ru sites and accumulate at the O V sites, leaving photogenerated holes at the Ru sites, aligning with previous analyses of photogenerated charge dynamics.Given that Ru sites serve as accumulation points for photogenerated holes, the activation process of H 2 O is calculated on Ru sites (Figure 5b).Although the activation of H 2 O to form protons on TiO 2 and Ru-O V /TiO 2 surfaces is endothermic, introducing Ru sites significantly reduces the dissociation energy of H from H 2 O molecules, accelerating the reduction kinetics of CO 2 to CH 4 .Gibbs free energy calculations were also conducted for potential CO 2 reduction routes.According to the calculation results in Figure 5c,d, the formation of CO intermediates is a rate-limiting step on TiO 2 , whereas introducing Ru-O V sites reduces the formation energy significantly.Most interestingly, as indicated in Section V in Figure 5d (marked in green), the Gibbs free energy of the CHO formation (G(CHO)) is notably lower than the desorption energy of the CO molecules (G( CO)).Specifically, the formation of CHO is an exothermic, spontaneous process, whereas the desorption process of CO is endothermic and involves a significant activation energy barrier.This result implies that the CO intermediate adsorbed on Ru-O V sites is more prone to undergoing protonation to produce CHO rather than desorption, explaining the high selectivity of Ru-O V /TiO 2 for CO 2 photoreduction to CH 4 .In contrast, as demonstrated by the pristine TiO 2 catalyst in Section V of Figure 5c, the formation of CHO requires overcoming a more considerable energy barrier, whereas the desorption of CO is thermodynamically more feasible.Thus, CO can relatively easily desorb from the pristine TiO 2 surface, forming free CO molecules. In brief, for Ru-O V /TiO 2 , the charge-rich and low-coordinated Ru-O V site can serve as a dual-active switch, facilitating the activation of H 2 O and lowering the overall activation energy barrier for CO 2 reduction, promoting the kinetics and thermodynamics of photocatalytic CO 2 methanation.Compared to the pristine TiO 2 with only Ti sites, these Ru-O V sites can form stronger bonds with CO intermediates, converting the originally endothermic protonation step into an exothermic reaction, promoting this conversion step.The strong bonding between CO and Ru-O V sites increases their desorption energy barrier, suppressing the CO production and altering the reaction routes to form CH 4 instead of CO over the Ru-O V /TiO 2 catalyst (Figure 5e)."}, {"llm generation": "pristine TiO 2", "source": "Pristine TiO 2 generates only trace amounts of CH 4 , where CO is the primary photocatalytic CO 2 reduction product, at a rate of 28.8 mol g -1 h -1 .", "context": "A series of Ru-O V /TiO 2 catalysts with various Ru loadings were synthesized using a modified impregnation and vacuum sintering method.The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns can be indexed to rutile TiO 2 , and no characteristic peaks of Ru or Ru oxide were observed (Figure S1, Supporting Information).The high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images depict the two-dimensional sheet-like morphology of TiO 2 and Ru-O V /TiO 2 , with exposed (001) crystal facets, and no particles or clusters were observed on the surface of the Ru-O V /TiO 2 nanosheets (Figure S2, Supporting Information).Ultra-high-resolution HAADF-STEM images confirmed the isolated distribution of the Ru species compared to pristine TiO 2 (Figure 1a), where distinct bright spots corresponding to the introduced Ru single atoms were observed on the surface of Ru-O V /TiO 2 (Figure 1b).The Ru species occupy the original Ti sites, indicating the presence of Ru in a substitutional form on the surface of TiO 2 (Figure 1c,d).Moreover, a darker contrast region was observed next to the Ru site, suggesting the presence of adjacent vacancies.Elemental mapping demonstrates the uniform distribution of oxygen, titanium, and ruthenium in the Ru-O V /TiO 2 catalyst (Figure 1e,f), further confirming the isolated dispersed nature of Ru.X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) also observed the introduction of Ru (Figure S3a, Supporting Information), with a noticeable shift in the Ti 2p XPS peak (Figure S3b, Supporting Information), indicating a strong interaction between Ru and the TiO 2 substrate.Introducing Ru results in distinct O V characteristic peaks in the O 1s XPS spectra (Figure 1g), confirming the formation of O V induced by Ru single atoms, further corroborated by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) tests (Figure S4, Supporting Information).

To provide insights into the nature of the active sites for CO 2 photoreduction with H 2 O over the Ru-O V /TiO 2 catalyst, DFT calculations were conducted to investigate the reaction mechanism.Based on the experimental conclusion that the adjacent Ru-O V sites on the Ru-O V /TiO 2 surface serve as active reaction sites, a corresponding model was constructed to simulate the catalyst (Figure S18, Supporting Information).First, the influence of Ru-O V sites on the band structure was examined.Compared to the uniformly distributed valence band (VB) and CB of pristine TiO 2 (Figure S19, Supporting Information), the VB region of Ru-O V /TiO 2 was concentrated around the Ru sites, whereas the CB region was distributed around the O V sites (Figure 5a).Hence, upon photoexcitation of Ru-O V /TiO 2 , photogenerated electrons transition from the Ru sites and accumulate at the O V sites, leaving photogenerated holes at the Ru sites, aligning with previous analyses of photogenerated charge dynamics.Given that Ru sites serve as accumulation points for photogenerated holes, the activation process of H 2 O is calculated on Ru sites (Figure 5b).Although the activation of H 2 O to form protons on TiO 2 and Ru-O V /TiO 2 surfaces is endothermic, introducing Ru sites significantly reduces the dissociation energy of H from H 2 O molecules, accelerating the reduction kinetics of CO 2 to CH 4 .Gibbs free energy calculations were also conducted for potential CO 2 reduction routes.According to the calculation results in Figure 5c,d, the formation of CO intermediates is a rate-limiting step on TiO 2 , whereas introducing Ru-O V sites reduces the formation energy significantly.Most interestingly, as indicated in Section V in Figure 5d (marked in green), the Gibbs free energy of the CHO formation (G(CHO)) is notably lower than the desorption energy of the CO molecules (G( CO)).Specifically, the formation of CHO is an exothermic, spontaneous process, whereas the desorption process of CO is endothermic and involves a significant activation energy barrier.This result implies that the CO intermediate adsorbed on Ru-O V sites is more prone to undergoing protonation to produce CHO rather than desorption, explaining the high selectivity of Ru-O V /TiO 2 for CO 2 photoreduction to CH 4 .In contrast, as demonstrated by the pristine TiO 2 catalyst in Section V of Figure 5c, the formation of CHO requires overcoming a more considerable energy barrier, whereas the desorption of CO is thermodynamically more feasible.Thus, CO can relatively easily desorb from the pristine TiO 2 surface, forming free CO molecules. In brief, for Ru-O V /TiO 2 , the charge-rich and low-coordinated Ru-O V site can serve as a dual-active switch, facilitating the activation of H 2 O and lowering the overall activation energy barrier for CO 2 reduction, promoting the kinetics and thermodynamics of photocatalytic CO 2 methanation.Compared to the pristine TiO 2 with only Ti sites, these Ru-O V sites can form stronger bonds with CO intermediates, converting the originally endothermic protonation step into an exothermic reaction, promoting this conversion step.The strong bonding between CO and Ru-O V sites increases their desorption energy barrier, suppressing the CO production and altering the reaction routes to form CH 4 instead of CO over the Ru-O V /TiO 2 catalyst (Figure 5e)."}], "co-catalyst": [{"llm generation": "Ru", "source": "This work establishes Ru-O V active sites on the surface of TiO 2 by anchoring coordination unsaturated Ru single-atoms, which stabilize crucial reaction intermediates and facilitate local mass transfer to achieve dual optimization of the thermodynamics and kinetics of the overall photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.", "context": "The photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) to methane (CH 4 ) represents a sustainable route for directly converting greenhouse gases into chemicals but poses a significant challenge in achieving high selectivity due to thermodynamic and kinetic limitations during the reaction process.This work establishes Ru-O V active sites on the surface of TiO 2 by anchoring coordination unsaturated Ru single-atoms, which stabilize crucial reaction intermediates and facilitate local mass transfer to achieve dual optimization of the thermodynamics and kinetics of the overall photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.Combining operando spectroscopy with density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicates that oxygen vacancies (O V ) inhibits the desorption of CO, whereas Ru facilitates proton extraction.This configuration not only lowers the overall activation energy barrier but has also been engineered to serve as a selectivity switch, changing the reaction route to produce CH 4 instead of CO.Consequently, the Ru-O V /TiO 2 exhibits a 195.4-fold improvement in the CH 4 yield compared to TiO 2 , accompanied by an increase in selectivity to 81."}, {"llm generation": "Ru", "source": "Ultra-high-resolution HAADF-STEM images confirmed the isolated distribution of the Ru species compared to pristine TiO 2 (Figure 1a), where distinct bright spots corresponding to the introduced Ru single atoms were observed on the surface of Ru-O V /TiO 2 (Figure 1b).", "context": "A series of Ru-O V /TiO 2 catalysts with various Ru loadings were synthesized using a modified impregnation and vacuum sintering method.The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns can be indexed to rutile TiO 2 , and no characteristic peaks of Ru or Ru oxide were observed (Figure S1, Supporting Information).The high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images depict the two-dimensional sheet-like morphology of TiO 2 and Ru-O V /TiO 2 , with exposed (001) crystal facets, and no particles or clusters were observed on the surface of the Ru-O V /TiO 2 nanosheets (Figure S2, Supporting Information).Ultra-high-resolution HAADF-STEM images confirmed the isolated distribution of the Ru species compared to pristine TiO 2 (Figure 1a), where distinct bright spots corresponding to the introduced Ru single atoms were observed on the surface of Ru-O V /TiO 2 (Figure 1b).The Ru species occupy the original Ti sites, indicating the presence of Ru in a substitutional form on the surface of TiO 2 (Figure 1c,d).Moreover, a darker contrast region was observed next to the Ru site, suggesting the presence of adjacent vacancies.Elemental mapping demonstrates the uniform distribution of oxygen, titanium, and ruthenium in the Ru-O V /TiO 2 catalyst (Figure 1e,f), further confirming the isolated dispersed nature of Ru.X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) also observed the introduction of Ru (Figure S3a, Supporting Information), with a noticeable shift in the Ti 2p XPS peak (Figure S3b, Supporting Information), indicating a strong interaction between Ru and the TiO 2 substrate.Introducing Ru results in distinct O V characteristic peaks in the O 1s XPS spectra (Figure 1g), confirming the formation of O V induced by Ru single atoms, further corroborated by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) tests (Figure S4, Supporting Information). To determine the location of the generated O V , we employed DFT calculations to examine the O V formation energy (Figure 1h).The calculation results indicate a substantial decrease in the vacancy formation energy at the two neighboring coordinated O atoms upon introducing single Ru atoms, suggesting the probable formation of O V at these sites (Figure 1i).The density of states (DOS) calculations also indicate that Ru occupies the highest empty orbitals at the Fermi level, confirming the potential for accumulating photogenerated holes (Figure S5, Supporting Information).The introduction of Ru and O V causes a downward shift in the Ti-occupied states in the conduction band (CB), suggesting that photogenerated electrons will UV-vis diffuse reflection spectra (DRS) were employed to evaluate the photo-absorption ability of the photocatalysts (Figure S8a, Supporting Information).Both TiO 2 and Ru-O V /TiO 2 exhibited similar absorption edges at 400 nm with the same band gap of 3.28 eV (Figure S8b, Supporting Information), indicating that modifying Ru-O V sites has little effect on the light harvest, which is not the decisive reason for the improved photocatalytic performance.Moreover, tail adsorption exceeding 400 nm was observed on the Ru-O V /TiO 2 sample, similar to that reported on the vacancy-rich TiO 2 , 27,28 confirming the presence of abundant O V .Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy tests were conducted to investigate the effect of introducing Ru on the charge separation.In Figure S9 (Supporting Information), Ru-O V /TiO 2 exhibited a significantly reduced PL signal compared to pristine TiO 2 , demonstrating enhanced charge separation efficiency.The kinetics of photogenerated electron-hole pairs were assessed to elucidate the positive influence of introducing Ru-O V sites on enhancing photocatalytic efficiency.The transient photocurrent response indicates that constructing Ru-O V is beneficial for increasing the photocurrent intensity of TiO 2 , significantly improving the photogenerated charge transfer efficiency (Figure S10a, Supporting Information).Furthermore, the Nyquist plot of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) under illumination reveals that Ru-O V /TiO 2 presents reduced carrier separation and transfer impedance (Figure S10b, Supporting Information).Therefore, introducing Ru-O V facilitates forming highly separated electronhole states, which is beneficial for enhancing photocatalytic activity.Time-resolved PL spectroscopy further explained the effect of introducing Ru on the charge transfer dynamics (Figure 2h).The slower fluorescence decay of Ru-O V /TiO 2 (26.88 ns) compared to pristine TiO 2 (7.17 ns) implies a more efficient charge separation and transfer. 29,30Further experimental evidence was provided by the solid-state in situ EPR spectra under light irradiation, as illustrated in Figure 2i.For pristine TiO 2 , light irradiation only causes limited signal enhancement, which is attributed to severe charge recombination.However, the EPR signal of Ru-O V /TiO 2 increased by about two-fold under light irradiation, indicating that the Ru-O V site can suppress the charge recombination to enhance the concentration of spin electrons excited to the CB. 313233 In situ high-resolution XPS in the dark and under light irradiation was conducted to investigate the charge transfer direction.Under illumination, the Ti 2p and O 1s XPS peaks display negative and positive shifts, respectively, corresponding to the intrinsic photoexcitation process of TiO 2 (Figure 2j,k).It is worth noting that the binding energy of Ru 3p XPS displays a pos-itive shift, suggesting the accumulation of photogenerated holes at Ru sites, consistent with predictions from previous DFT calculations (Figure 2j).Therefore, these results demonstrate that Ru and its induced O V promote the directional separation of photogenerated charges, forming localized regions enriched with electrons and holes to facilitate CO 2 reduction and H 2 O activation. The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance of prepared catalysts was evaluated in a customized sealed quartz glass reactor under the irradiation of a 300 W Xe lamp.For each reaction, the system was evacuated and filled with CO 2 to adjust the pressure at 70 kPa, followed by adding 500 L of H 2 O as a proton source.Hence, gaseous products of CH 4 and CO were detected, with no detection of H 2 or any liquid-phase products (e.g., CH 3 OH, HCHO, HCOOH, etc.). Figure 3a,b illustrates the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance of the prepared samples.Pristine TiO 2 generates only trace amounts of CH 4 , where CO is the primary photocatalytic CO 2 reduction product, at a rate of 28.8 mol g -1 h -1 .Upon introducing Ru-O V sites, the CH 4 yield significantly increases, accompanied by a decrease in the CO yield.The CH 4 yield reaches its maximum when the Ru loading is 1.22 (50.1 mol g -1 h -1 ), displaying a remarkable increase of 195.4 times that of pristine TiO 2 , whereas the corresponding CO yield decreases to 38 of the pristine TiO 2 .Based on the average product content, the CH 4 selectivity of the optimized Ru-O V /TiO 2 sample is 81, signifying a radical transformation compared to the 1 CH 4 selectivity of TiO 2 (Figure 3c).The considerable changes in product selectivity suggest differences in the CO 2 reduction mechanism and active sites between Ru-O V /TiO 2 and pristine TiO 2 .Subjecting Ru-O V /TiO 2 to heat treatment at 300 C in the air to oxidize its surface OV (i.e., Ru-O V /TiO 2 -oxidized) resulted in a change in selectivity, with a significant decrease in the CH 4 yield accompanied by an increase in the CO yield (Figure 3d).Further heat treatment of the Ru-O V /TiO 2 -oxidized sample under a vacuum to restore its surface O V led to a recovery of its product selectivity toward CH 4 dominance.These observations indicate that O V is a critical factor in modulating product selectivity. Furthermore, the control experiments under other conditions were conducted to confirm the CO 2 photoreduction on Ru-O V /TiO 2 (Figure S11, Supporting Information).In the absence of light, catalysts, or CO 2 , no carbon-containing products can be detected, demonstrating that the observed products were generated from light-driven CO 2 reduction catalyzed by Ru-O V /TiO 2 .Moreover, without adding H 2 O in the reaction system, no products were detected, indicating that CO 2 reduction requires H 2 O as a proton source.Isotopic experiments with 13 CO 2 confirmed that the carbon-containing products were generated from the photoreduction of CO 2 molecules.When the reaction was conducted in a 13 CO 2 atmosphere, only 13 CO and 13 CH 4 were detected, as illustrated in Figure 3e.In addition to its remarkable photocatalytic activity, Ru-O V /TiO 2 has excellent stability.As depicted in Figure S12 (Supporting Information), no noticeable decrease in the activity for CO 2 photoreduction was observed in the cycling tests.The characteristics of Ru-O V /TiO 2 after the continuous reaction remain almost the same as those in the fresh samples (Figure S13, Supporting Information), confirming the excellent stability of the catalyst. The adsorption process of CO 2 on the surfaces was examined to investigate the mechanism of CO 2 photoreduction on Considering that introducing the Ru species reduces the specific surface area of TiO 2 (Figure S14, Supporting Information), we can infer that the two-fold increase in CO 2 adsorption on Ru-O V /TiO 2 surfaces stems from the presence of specific CO 2 adsorption sites.Then, in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) was applied to monitor the process of CO 2 adsorption dynamically on TiO 2 and Ru-O V /TiO 2 .Figure S15 (Supporting Information) displays the characteristic CO 2 adsorption band ( 3 (CO 2 )) with infrared peaks from 3592 to 3728 cm -1 , 34,35 where these intensity changes imply an excellent CO 2 adsorption capacity of the Ru-O V sites.The increased CO 2 adsorption capacity is critical for the photocatalytic reactions on the surface of Ru-O V /TiO 2 .The electron transfer process in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was evidented by using in situ XPS analysis.In Figure S16 (Supporting Information), under illumination, the Ti 2p binding energy shifted negatively by 0.19 eV, whereas the Ru 3p shifted positively by 0.21 eV, indicating the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes at Ru-O V sites.After introducing CO 2 into the system, the Ti 2p binding energy shifted positively by 0.13 eV, whereas the Ru 3p binding energy remained nearly unchanged, suggesting that the photogenerated electrons were transferred from Ti (adjacent to O V ) to CO 2 . An in situ DRIFTS analysis was conducted under reaction conditions to elucidate the structural evolution of the surfaceabsorbed species.Supplementary Table S1 (Supporting Informa-tion) lists the assignments of all band vibration peaks.As depicted in Figure 4a,e, the activation of CO 2 on the catalyst surface initially proceeds with the assistance of H 2 O molecules to generate carbonate species, encompassing three distinct types of characteristic peaks: chelating-bridged carbonate (c-CO 3 2-: 1765 cm -1 ), 36 bidentate carbonate (b-CO 3 2-, with asymmetric CO 3 stretching vibration at 1560 cm -1 and symmetric CO 3 stretching vibration at 1395 cm -1 ), 30,37,38 and monodentate carbonate (m-CO 3 2-: 1541 and 1522 cm -1 ). 39,40Comparing the intensity of the characteristic peaks explained the differences in the initial activation process of CO 2 on the surfaces of TiO 2 and Ru-O V /TiO 2 .Carbonate species on TiO 2 were predominantly present as m-CO 3 2-, confirming the single-point adsorption of CO 2 on individual Ti sites.Upon introducing Ru-O V sites, the characteristic peak of m-CO 3 2-significantly decreased while enhancing the characteristic peaks of b-CO 3 2-and c-CO 3 2-.This finding suggests that Ru-O V sites promote the bridging adsorption of CO 2 molecules, directly altering the reaction routes.The characteristic peak of c-CO 3 2-undergoes a pronounced increase followed by a decrease, indicating that CO 2 on Ru-O V sites has a faster reduction kinetic process.Further, bicarbonate HCO 3 -and formate intermediate COOH were observed, 414243 indicating that the transformation of bicarbonates to formate appears to follow the following route: CO 3 2- HCO 3 - COOH.The formed COOH tends to preserve the initial adsorption state of CO 2 .Therefore, after further hydrogenation and dehydration, CO on the TiO 2 surface desorbs to form CO (Figure 4b), whereas CO on the Ru-O V /TiO 2 surface remains stabilized on Ru-O V sites (Figure 4f). 25,44,45Additionally, vibrational peaks corresponding to CHO, CH 2 O, and CH 3 O were detected on Ru-O V /TiO 2 (Figure 4g), 46474849 which are absent on TiO 2 (Figure 4c 50 In Figure S17a (Supporting Information), the dissociation of D 2 O on TiO 2 leads to two characteristic Ti-OD peaks at 2338 cm -1 and 2373 cm -1 , indicating the dissociation of water molecules at Ti sites on pristine TiO 2 . 47,51In contrast, for Ru-O V /TiO 2 , the original Ti-OD peak intensity weakens, and new characteristic peaks attributed to Ru-OD occur (Figure S17b, Supporting Information), indicating that Ru sites on Ru-O V /TiO 2 are the primary active centers for water activation. 26ased on the preceding analysis, it is evident that CO species, derived from the hydrogenation of the COOH species, is the most crucial intermediate affecting the selectivity of the final products.Its desorption or further hydrogenation corresponds to the production of CO or CH 4 , respectively.Therefore, CO temperature programmed desorption (TPD) testing was conducted to confirm the influence of Ru-O V sites on CO adsorption.As depicted in Figure 4h, pristine TiO 2 has a CO desorption peak at 200 C.However, upon introducing Ru-O V sites, the CO desorption peak shifts to a higher temperature region (600 C), demonstrating the existence of more robust CO adsorption sites on the catalyst surface.The in situ DRIFTS analysis reveals that bridging the adsorption of CO is crucial to significantly improving adsorption stability, inferring that Ru-O V sites serve as the bridging adsorption sites for CO.Then, oxidation was performed on Ru-O V /TiO 2 to remove most of the O V .Under these conditions, the CO desorption peak returned to 200 C, indicating that the Ru sites without O V cannot enhance the adsorption strength of CO, strongly supporting the conclusion that Ru-O V serves as the bridging adsorption site for CO.

To determine the location of the generated O V , we employed DFT calculations to examine the O V formation energy (Figure 1h).The calculation results indicate a substantial decrease in the vacancy formation energy at the two neighboring coordinated O atoms upon introducing single Ru atoms, suggesting the probable formation of O V at these sites (Figure 1i).The density of states (DOS) calculations also indicate that Ru occupies the highest empty orbitals at the Fermi level, confirming the potential for accumulating photogenerated holes (Figure S5, Supporting Information).The introduction of Ru and O V causes a downward shift in the Ti-occupied states in the conduction band (CB), suggesting that photogenerated electrons will UV-vis diffuse reflection spectra (DRS) were employed to evaluate the photo-absorption ability of the photocatalysts (Figure S8a, Supporting Information).Both TiO 2 and Ru-O V /TiO 2 exhibited similar absorption edges at 400 nm with the same band gap of 3.28 eV (Figure S8b, Supporting Information), indicating that modifying Ru-O V sites has little effect on the light harvest, which is not the decisive reason for the improved photocatalytic performance.Moreover, tail adsorption exceeding 400 nm was observed on the Ru-O V /TiO 2 sample, similar to that reported on the vacancy-rich TiO 2 , 27,28 confirming the presence of abundant O V .Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy tests were conducted to investigate the effect of introducing Ru on the charge separation.In Figure S9 (Supporting Information), Ru-O V /TiO 2 exhibited a significantly reduced PL signal compared to pristine TiO 2 , demonstrating enhanced charge separation efficiency.The kinetics of photogenerated electron-hole pairs were assessed to elucidate the positive influence of introducing Ru-O V sites on enhancing photocatalytic efficiency.The transient photocurrent response indicates that constructing Ru-O V is beneficial for increasing the photocurrent intensity of TiO 2 , significantly improving the photogenerated charge transfer efficiency (Figure S10a, Supporting Information).Furthermore, the Nyquist plot of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) under illumination reveals that Ru-O V /TiO 2 presents reduced carrier separation and transfer impedance (Figure S10b, Supporting Information).Therefore, introducing Ru-O V facilitates forming highly separated electronhole states, which is beneficial for enhancing photocatalytic activity.Time-resolved PL spectroscopy further explained the effect of introducing Ru on the charge transfer dynamics (Figure 2h).The slower fluorescence decay of Ru-O V /TiO 2 (26.88 ns) compared to pristine TiO 2 (7.17 ns) implies a more efficient charge separation and transfer. 29,30Further experimental evidence was provided by the solid-state in situ EPR spectra under light irradiation, as illustrated in Figure 2i.For pristine TiO 2 , light irradiation only causes limited signal enhancement, which is attributed to severe charge recombination.However, the EPR signal of Ru-O V /TiO 2 increased by about two-fold under light irradiation, indicating that the Ru-O V site can suppress the charge recombination to enhance the concentration of spin electrons excited to the CB. 313233 In situ high-resolution XPS in the dark and under light irradiation was conducted to investigate the charge transfer direction.Under illumination, the Ti 2p and O 1s XPS peaks display negative and positive shifts, respectively, corresponding to the intrinsic photoexcitation process of TiO 2 (Figure 2j,k).It is worth noting that the binding energy of Ru 3p XPS displays a pos-itive shift, suggesting the accumulation of photogenerated holes at Ru sites, consistent with predictions from previous DFT calculations (Figure 2j).Therefore, these results demonstrate that Ru and its induced O V promote the directional separation of photogenerated charges, forming localized regions enriched with electrons and holes to facilitate CO 2 reduction and H 2 O activation. The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance of prepared catalysts was evaluated in a customized sealed quartz glass reactor under the irradiation of a 300 W Xe lamp.For each reaction, the system was evacuated and filled with CO 2 to adjust the pressure at 70 kPa, followed by adding 500 L of H 2 O as a proton source.Hence, gaseous products of CH 4 and CO were detected, with no detection of H 2 or any liquid-phase products (e.g., CH 3 OH, HCHO, HCOOH, etc.). Figure 3a,b illustrates the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance of the prepared samples.Pristine TiO 2 generates only trace amounts of CH 4 , where CO is the primary photocatalytic CO 2 reduction product, at a rate of 28.8 mol g -1 h -1 .Upon introducing Ru-O V sites, the CH 4 yield significantly increases, accompanied by a decrease in the CO yield.The CH 4 yield reaches its maximum when the Ru loading is 1.22 (50.1 mol g -1 h -1 ), displaying a remarkable increase of 195.4 times that of pristine TiO 2 , whereas the corresponding CO yield decreases to 38 of the pristine TiO 2 .Based on the average product content, the CH 4 selectivity of the optimized Ru-O V /TiO 2 sample is 81, signifying a radical transformation compared to the 1 CH 4 selectivity of TiO 2 (Figure 3c).The considerable changes in product selectivity suggest differences in the CO 2 reduction mechanism and active sites between Ru-O V /TiO 2 and pristine TiO 2 .Subjecting Ru-O V /TiO 2 to heat treatment at 300 C in the air to oxidize its surface OV (i.e., Ru-O V /TiO 2 -oxidized) resulted in a change in selectivity, with a significant decrease in the CH 4 yield accompanied by an increase in the CO yield (Figure 3d).Further heat treatment of the Ru-O V /TiO 2 -oxidized sample under a vacuum to restore its surface O V led to a recovery of its product selectivity toward CH 4 dominance.These observations indicate that O V is a critical factor in modulating product selectivity. Furthermore, the control experiments under other conditions were conducted to confirm the CO 2 photoreduction on Ru-O V /TiO 2 (Figure S11, Supporting Information).In the absence of light, catalysts, or CO 2 , no carbon-containing products can be detected, demonstrating that the observed products were generated from light-driven CO 2 reduction catalyzed by Ru-O V /TiO 2 .Moreover, without adding H 2 O in the reaction system, no products were detected, indicating that CO 2 reduction requires H 2 O as a proton source.Isotopic experiments with 13 CO 2 confirmed that the carbon-containing products were generated from the photoreduction of CO 2 molecules.When the reaction was conducted in a 13 CO 2 atmosphere, only 13 CO and 13 CH 4 were detected, as illustrated in Figure 3e.In addition to its remarkable photocatalytic activity, Ru-O V /TiO 2 has excellent stability.As depicted in Figure S12 (Supporting Information), no noticeable decrease in the activity for CO 2 photoreduction was observed in the cycling tests.The characteristics of Ru-O V /TiO 2 after the continuous reaction remain almost the same as those in the fresh samples (Figure S13, Supporting Information), confirming the excellent stability of the catalyst. The adsorption process of CO 2 on the surfaces was examined to investigate the mechanism of CO 2 photoreduction on Considering that introducing the Ru species reduces the specific surface area of TiO 2 (Figure S14, Supporting Information), we can infer that the two-fold increase in CO 2 adsorption on Ru-O V /TiO 2 surfaces stems from the presence of specific CO 2 adsorption sites.Then, in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) was applied to monitor the process of CO 2 adsorption dynamically on TiO 2 and Ru-O V /TiO 2 .Figure S15 (Supporting Information) displays the characteristic CO 2 adsorption band ( 3 (CO 2 )) with infrared peaks from 3592 to 3728 cm -1 , 34,35 where these intensity changes imply an excellent CO 2 adsorption capacity of the Ru-O V sites.The increased CO 2 adsorption capacity is critical for the photocatalytic reactions on the surface of Ru-O V /TiO 2 .The electron transfer process in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was evidented by using in situ XPS analysis.In Figure S16 (Supporting Information), under illumination, the Ti 2p binding energy shifted negatively by 0.19 eV, whereas the Ru 3p shifted positively by 0.21 eV, indicating the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes at Ru-O V sites.After introducing CO 2 into the system, the Ti 2p binding energy shifted positively by 0.13 eV, whereas the Ru 3p binding energy remained nearly unchanged, suggesting that the photogenerated electrons were transferred from Ti (adjacent to O V ) to CO 2 . An in situ DRIFTS analysis was conducted under reaction conditions to elucidate the structural evolution of the surfaceabsorbed species.Supplementary Table S1 (Supporting Informa-tion) lists the assignments of all band vibration peaks.As depicted in Figure 4a,e, the activation of CO 2 on the catalyst surface initially proceeds with the assistance of H 2 O molecules to generate carbonate species, encompassing three distinct types of characteristic peaks: chelating-bridged carbonate (c-CO 3 2-: 1765 cm -1 ), 36 bidentate carbonate (b-CO 3 2-, with asymmetric CO 3 stretching vibration at 1560 cm -1 and symmetric CO 3 stretching vibration at 1395 cm -1 ), 30,37,38 and monodentate carbonate (m-CO 3 2-: 1541 and 1522 cm -1 ). 39,40Comparing the intensity of the characteristic peaks explained the differences in the initial activation process of CO 2 on the surfaces of TiO 2 and Ru-O V /TiO 2 .Carbonate species on TiO 2 were predominantly present as m-CO 3 2-, confirming the single-point adsorption of CO 2 on individual Ti sites.Upon introducing Ru-O V sites, the characteristic peak of m-CO 3 2-significantly decreased while enhancing the characteristic peaks of b-CO 3 2-and c-CO 3 2-.This finding suggests that Ru-O V sites promote the bridging adsorption of CO 2 molecules, directly altering the reaction routes.The characteristic peak of c-CO 3 2-undergoes a pronounced increase followed by a decrease, indicating that CO 2 on Ru-O V sites has a faster reduction kinetic process.Further, bicarbonate HCO 3 -and formate intermediate COOH were observed, 414243 indicating that the transformation of bicarbonates to formate appears to follow the following route: CO 3 2- HCO 3 - COOH.The formed COOH tends to preserve the initial adsorption state of CO 2 .Therefore, after further hydrogenation and dehydration, CO on the TiO 2 surface desorbs to form CO (Figure 4b), whereas CO on the Ru-O V /TiO 2 surface remains stabilized on Ru-O V sites (Figure 4f). 25,44,45Additionally, vibrational peaks corresponding to CHO, CH 2 O, and CH 3 O were detected on Ru-O V /TiO 2 (Figure 4g), 46474849 which are absent on TiO 2 (Figure 4c 50 In Figure S17a (Supporting Information), the dissociation of D 2 O on TiO 2 leads to two characteristic Ti-OD peaks at 2338 cm -1 and 2373 cm -1 , indicating the dissociation of water molecules at Ti sites on pristine TiO 2 . 47,51In contrast, for Ru-O V /TiO 2 , the original Ti-OD peak intensity weakens, and new characteristic peaks attributed to Ru-OD occur (Figure S17b, Supporting Information), indicating that Ru sites on Ru-O V /TiO 2 are the primary active centers for water activation. 26ased on the preceding analysis, it is evident that CO species, derived from the hydrogenation of the COOH species, is the most crucial intermediate affecting the selectivity of the final products.Its desorption or further hydrogenation corresponds to the production of CO or CH 4 , respectively.Therefore, CO temperature programmed desorption (TPD) testing was conducted to confirm the influence of Ru-O V sites on CO adsorption.As depicted in Figure 4h, pristine TiO 2 has a CO desorption peak at 200 C.However, upon introducing Ru-O V sites, the CO desorption peak shifts to a higher temperature region (600 C), demonstrating the existence of more robust CO adsorption sites on the catalyst surface.The in situ DRIFTS analysis reveals that bridging the adsorption of CO is crucial to significantly improving adsorption stability, inferring that Ru-O V sites serve as the bridging adsorption sites for CO.Then, oxidation was performed on Ru-O V /TiO 2 to remove most of the O V .Under these conditions, the CO desorption peak returned to 200 C, indicating that the Ru sites without O V cannot enhance the adsorption strength of CO, strongly supporting the conclusion that Ru-O V serves as the bridging adsorption site for CO. To provide insights into the nature of the active sites for CO 2 photoreduction with H 2 O over the Ru-O V /TiO 2 catalyst, DFT calculations were conducted to investigate the reaction mechanism.Based on the experimental conclusion that the adjacent Ru-O V sites on the Ru-O V /TiO 2 surface serve as active reaction sites, a corresponding model was constructed to simulate the catalyst (Figure S18, Supporting Information).First, the influence of Ru-O V sites on the band structure was examined.Compared to the uniformly distributed valence band (VB) and CB of pristine TiO 2 (Figure S19, Supporting Information), the VB region of Ru-O V /TiO 2 was concentrated around the Ru sites, whereas the CB region was distributed around the O V sites (Figure 5a).Hence, upon photoexcitation of Ru-O V /TiO 2 , photogenerated electrons transition from the Ru sites and accumulate at the O V sites, leaving photogenerated holes at the Ru sites, aligning with previous analyses of photogenerated charge dynamics.Given that Ru sites serve as accumulation points for photogenerated holes, the activation process of H 2 O is calculated on Ru sites (Figure 5b).Although the activation of H 2 O to form protons on TiO 2 and Ru-O V /TiO 2 surfaces is endothermic, introducing Ru sites significantly reduces the dissociation energy of H from H 2 O molecules, accelerating the reduction kinetics of CO 2 to CH 4 .Gibbs free energy calculations were also conducted for potential CO 2 reduction routes.According to the calculation results in Figure 5c,d, the formation of CO intermediates is a rate-limiting step on TiO 2 , whereas introducing Ru-O V sites reduces the formation energy significantly.Most interestingly, as indicated in Section V in Figure 5d (marked in green), the Gibbs free energy of the CHO formation (G(CHO)) is notably lower than the desorption energy of the CO molecules (G( CO)).Specifically, the formation of CHO is an exothermic, spontaneous process, whereas the desorption process of CO is endothermic and involves a significant activation energy barrier.This result implies that the CO intermediate adsorbed on Ru-O V sites is more prone to undergoing protonation to produce CHO rather than desorption, explaining the high selectivity of Ru-O V /TiO 2 for CO 2 photoreduction to CH 4 .In contrast, as demonstrated by the pristine TiO 2 catalyst in Section V of Figure 5c, the formation of CHO requires overcoming a more considerable energy barrier, whereas the desorption of CO is thermodynamically more feasible.Thus, CO can relatively easily desorb from the pristine TiO 2 surface, forming free CO molecules. In brief, for Ru-O V /TiO 2 , the charge-rich and low-coordinated Ru-O V site can serve as a dual-active switch, facilitating the activation of H 2 O and lowering the overall activation energy barrier for CO 2 reduction, promoting the kinetics and thermodynamics of photocatalytic CO 2 methanation.Compared to the pristine TiO 2 with only Ti sites, these Ru-O V sites can form stronger bonds with CO intermediates, converting the originally endothermic protonation step into an exothermic reaction, promoting this conversion step.The strong bonding between CO and Ru-O V sites increases their desorption energy barrier, suppressing the CO production and altering the reaction routes to form CH 4 instead of CO over the Ru-O V /TiO 2 catalyst (Figure 5e)."}, {"llm generation": "light", "source": "Driven by light, Ru-O V /TiO 2 photocatalyzes the conversion of CO 2 and H 2 O into CH 4 with a yield increased by 195.4 times that of pristine TiO 2 , and the selectivity increased to 81.", "context": "In summary, this paper introduced adjacent single-atom Ru and O V dual-functional sites on the surface of TiO 2 via atomic engineering, aiming to enhance the kinetics and thermodynamics of CO 2 photoreduction.Theoretical calculations and in situ irradiated spectroscopy confirmed the directional migration of photoexcited charge carriers at Ru-O V sites, forming charge-rich oxidative-reductive adjacent dual-functional sites and facilitating proton extraction and transfer.Moreover, in situ DRIFTS, CO-TPD, and Gibbs free energy calculations demonstrated that Ru-O V sites can absorb CO 2 via a bridging mode, resulting in a stable configuration of CO intermediates.This adsorption reduces the overall activation energy barrier and converts the originally endothermic protonation process into a thermodynamically spontaneous process, fundamentally altering the reaction route to form CH 4 instead of CO.Driven by light, Ru-O V /TiO 2 photocatalyzes the conversion of CO 2 and H 2 O into CH 4 with a yield increased by 195.4 times that of pristine TiO 2 , and the selectivity increased to 81.This work provides a unique understanding of designing photocatalysts with selective CO 2 conversion, advancing the realization of photoreduction of CO 2 into solar energy.

To determine the location of the generated O V , we employed DFT calculations to examine the O V formation energy (Figure 1h).The calculation results indicate a substantial decrease in the vacancy formation energy at the two neighboring coordinated O atoms upon introducing single Ru atoms, suggesting the probable formation of O V at these sites (Figure 1i).The density of states (DOS) calculations also indicate that Ru occupies the highest empty orbitals at the Fermi level, confirming the potential for accumulating photogenerated holes (Figure S5, Supporting Information).The introduction of Ru and O V causes a downward shift in the Ti-occupied states in the conduction band (CB), suggesting that photogenerated electrons will UV-vis diffuse reflection spectra (DRS) were employed to evaluate the photo-absorption ability of the photocatalysts (Figure S8a, Supporting Information).Both TiO 2 and Ru-O V /TiO 2 exhibited similar absorption edges at 400 nm with the same band gap of 3.28 eV (Figure S8b, Supporting Information), indicating that modifying Ru-O V sites has little effect on the light harvest, which is not the decisive reason for the improved photocatalytic performance.Moreover, tail adsorption exceeding 400 nm was observed on the Ru-O V /TiO 2 sample, similar to that reported on the vacancy-rich TiO 2 , 27,28 confirming the presence of abundant O V .Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy tests were conducted to investigate the effect of introducing Ru on the charge separation.In Figure S9 (Supporting Information), Ru-O V /TiO 2 exhibited a significantly reduced PL signal compared to pristine TiO 2 , demonstrating enhanced charge separation efficiency.The kinetics of photogenerated electron-hole pairs were assessed to elucidate the positive influence of introducing Ru-O V sites on enhancing photocatalytic efficiency.The transient photocurrent response indicates that constructing Ru-O V is beneficial for increasing the photocurrent intensity of TiO 2 , significantly improving the photogenerated charge transfer efficiency (Figure S10a, Supporting Information).Furthermore, the Nyquist plot of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) under illumination reveals that Ru-O V /TiO 2 presents reduced carrier separation and transfer impedance (Figure S10b, Supporting Information).Therefore, introducing Ru-O V facilitates forming highly separated electronhole states, which is beneficial for enhancing photocatalytic activity.Time-resolved PL spectroscopy further explained the effect of introducing Ru on the charge transfer dynamics (Figure 2h).The slower fluorescence decay of Ru-O V /TiO 2 (26.88 ns) compared to pristine TiO 2 (7.17 ns) implies a more efficient charge separation and transfer. 29,30Further experimental evidence was provided by the solid-state in situ EPR spectra under light irradiation, as illustrated in Figure 2i.For pristine TiO 2 , light irradiation only causes limited signal enhancement, which is attributed to severe charge recombination.However, the EPR signal of Ru-O V /TiO 2 increased by about two-fold under light irradiation, indicating that the Ru-O V site can suppress the charge recombination to enhance the concentration of spin electrons excited to the CB. 313233 In situ high-resolution XPS in the dark and under light irradiation was conducted to investigate the charge transfer direction.Under illumination, the Ti 2p and O 1s XPS peaks display negative and positive shifts, respectively, corresponding to the intrinsic photoexcitation process of TiO 2 (Figure 2j,k).It is worth noting that the binding energy of Ru 3p XPS displays a pos-itive shift, suggesting the accumulation of photogenerated holes at Ru sites, consistent with predictions from previous DFT calculations (Figure 2j).Therefore, these results demonstrate that Ru and its induced O V promote the directional separation of photogenerated charges, forming localized regions enriched with electrons and holes to facilitate CO 2 reduction and H 2 O activation. The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance of prepared catalysts was evaluated in a customized sealed quartz glass reactor under the irradiation of a 300 W Xe lamp.For each reaction, the system was evacuated and filled with CO 2 to adjust the pressure at 70 kPa, followed by adding 500 L of H 2 O as a proton source.Hence, gaseous products of CH 4 and CO were detected, with no detection of H 2 or any liquid-phase products (e.g., CH 3 OH, HCHO, HCOOH, etc.). Figure 3a,b illustrates the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance of the prepared samples.Pristine TiO 2 generates only trace amounts of CH 4 , where CO is the primary photocatalytic CO 2 reduction product, at a rate of 28.8 mol g -1 h -1 .Upon introducing Ru-O V sites, the CH 4 yield significantly increases, accompanied by a decrease in the CO yield.The CH 4 yield reaches its maximum when the Ru loading is 1.22 (50.1 mol g -1 h -1 ), displaying a remarkable increase of 195.4 times that of pristine TiO 2 , whereas the corresponding CO yield decreases to 38 of the pristine TiO 2 .Based on the average product content, the CH 4 selectivity of the optimized Ru-O V /TiO 2 sample is 81, signifying a radical transformation compared to the 1 CH 4 selectivity of TiO 2 (Figure 3c).The considerable changes in product selectivity suggest differences in the CO 2 reduction mechanism and active sites between Ru-O V /TiO 2 and pristine TiO 2 .Subjecting Ru-O V /TiO 2 to heat treatment at 300 C in the air to oxidize its surface OV (i.e., Ru-O V /TiO 2 -oxidized) resulted in a change in selectivity, with a significant decrease in the CH 4 yield accompanied by an increase in the CO yield (Figure 3d).Further heat treatment of the Ru-O V /TiO 2 -oxidized sample under a vacuum to restore its surface O V led to a recovery of its product selectivity toward CH 4 dominance.These observations indicate that O V is a critical factor in modulating product selectivity. Furthermore, the control experiments under other conditions were conducted to confirm the CO 2 photoreduction on Ru-O V /TiO 2 (Figure S11, Supporting Information).In the absence of light, catalysts, or CO 2 , no carbon-containing products can be detected, demonstrating that the observed products were generated from light-driven CO 2 reduction catalyzed by Ru-O V /TiO 2 .Moreover, without adding H 2 O in the reaction system, no products were detected, indicating that CO 2 reduction requires H 2 O as a proton source.Isotopic experiments with 13 CO 2 confirmed that the carbon-containing products were generated from the photoreduction of CO 2 molecules.When the reaction was conducted in a 13 CO 2 atmosphere, only 13 CO and 13 CH 4 were detected, as illustrated in Figure 3e.In addition to its remarkable photocatalytic activity, Ru-O V /TiO 2 has excellent stability.As depicted in Figure S12 (Supporting Information), no noticeable decrease in the activity for CO 2 photoreduction was observed in the cycling tests.The characteristics of Ru-O V /TiO 2 after the continuous reaction remain almost the same as those in the fresh samples (Figure S13, Supporting Information), confirming the excellent stability of the catalyst. The adsorption process of CO 2 on the surfaces was examined to investigate the mechanism of CO 2 photoreduction on Considering that introducing the Ru species reduces the specific surface area of TiO 2 (Figure S14, Supporting Information), we can infer that the two-fold increase in CO 2 adsorption on Ru-O V /TiO 2 surfaces stems from the presence of specific CO 2 adsorption sites.Then, in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) was applied to monitor the process of CO 2 adsorption dynamically on TiO 2 and Ru-O V /TiO 2 .Figure S15 (Supporting Information) displays the characteristic CO 2 adsorption band ( 3 (CO 2 )) with infrared peaks from 3592 to 3728 cm -1 , 34,35 where these intensity changes imply an excellent CO 2 adsorption capacity of the Ru-O V sites.The increased CO 2 adsorption capacity is critical for the photocatalytic reactions on the surface of Ru-O V /TiO 2 .The electron transfer process in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was evidented by using in situ XPS analysis.In Figure S16 (Supporting Information), under illumination, the Ti 2p binding energy shifted negatively by 0.19 eV, whereas the Ru 3p shifted positively by 0.21 eV, indicating the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes at Ru-O V sites.After introducing CO 2 into the system, the Ti 2p binding energy shifted positively by 0.13 eV, whereas the Ru 3p binding energy remained nearly unchanged, suggesting that the photogenerated electrons were transferred from Ti (adjacent to O V ) to CO 2 . An in situ DRIFTS analysis was conducted under reaction conditions to elucidate the structural evolution of the surfaceabsorbed species.Supplementary Table S1 (Supporting Informa-tion) lists the assignments of all band vibration peaks.As depicted in Figure 4a,e, the activation of CO 2 on the catalyst surface initially proceeds with the assistance of H 2 O molecules to generate carbonate species, encompassing three distinct types of characteristic peaks: chelating-bridged carbonate (c-CO 3 2-: 1765 cm -1 ), 36 bidentate carbonate (b-CO 3 2-, with asymmetric CO 3 stretching vibration at 1560 cm -1 and symmetric CO 3 stretching vibration at 1395 cm -1 ), 30,37,38 and monodentate carbonate (m-CO 3 2-: 1541 and 1522 cm -1 ). 39,40Comparing the intensity of the characteristic peaks explained the differences in the initial activation process of CO 2 on the surfaces of TiO 2 and Ru-O V /TiO 2 .Carbonate species on TiO 2 were predominantly present as m-CO 3 2-, confirming the single-point adsorption of CO 2 on individual Ti sites.Upon introducing Ru-O V sites, the characteristic peak of m-CO 3 2-significantly decreased while enhancing the characteristic peaks of b-CO 3 2-and c-CO 3 2-.This finding suggests that Ru-O V sites promote the bridging adsorption of CO 2 molecules, directly altering the reaction routes.The characteristic peak of c-CO 3 2-undergoes a pronounced increase followed by a decrease, indicating that CO 2 on Ru-O V sites has a faster reduction kinetic process.Further, bicarbonate HCO 3 -and formate intermediate COOH were observed, 414243 indicating that the transformation of bicarbonates to formate appears to follow the following route: CO 3 2- HCO 3 - COOH.The formed COOH tends to preserve the initial adsorption state of CO 2 .Therefore, after further hydrogenation and dehydration, CO on the TiO 2 surface desorbs to form CO (Figure 4b), whereas CO on the Ru-O V /TiO 2 surface remains stabilized on Ru-O V sites (Figure 4f). 25,44,45Additionally, vibrational peaks corresponding to CHO, CH 2 O, and CH 3 O were detected on Ru-O V /TiO 2 (Figure 4g), 46474849 which are absent on TiO 2 (Figure 4c 50 In Figure S17a (Supporting Information), the dissociation of D 2 O on TiO 2 leads to two characteristic Ti-OD peaks at 2338 cm -1 and 2373 cm -1 , indicating the dissociation of water molecules at Ti sites on pristine TiO 2 . 47,51In contrast, for Ru-O V /TiO 2 , the original Ti-OD peak intensity weakens, and new characteristic peaks attributed to Ru-OD occur (Figure S17b, Supporting Information), indicating that Ru sites on Ru-O V /TiO 2 are the primary active centers for water activation. 26ased on the preceding analysis, it is evident that CO species, derived from the hydrogenation of the COOH species, is the most crucial intermediate affecting the selectivity of the final products.Its desorption or further hydrogenation corresponds to the production of CO or CH 4 , respectively.Therefore, CO temperature programmed desorption (TPD) testing was conducted to confirm the influence of Ru-O V sites on CO adsorption.As depicted in Figure 4h, pristine TiO 2 has a CO desorption peak at 200 C.However, upon introducing Ru-O V sites, the CO desorption peak shifts to a higher temperature region (600 C), demonstrating the existence of more robust CO adsorption sites on the catalyst surface.The in situ DRIFTS analysis reveals that bridging the adsorption of CO is crucial to significantly improving adsorption stability, inferring that Ru-O V sites serve as the bridging adsorption sites for CO.Then, oxidation was performed on Ru-O V /TiO 2 to remove most of the O V .Under these conditions, the CO desorption peak returned to 200 C, indicating that the Ru sites without O V cannot enhance the adsorption strength of CO, strongly supporting the conclusion that Ru-O V serves as the bridging adsorption site for CO. To provide insights into the nature of the active sites for CO 2 photoreduction with H 2 O over the Ru-O V /TiO 2 catalyst, DFT calculations were conducted to investigate the reaction mechanism.Based on the experimental conclusion that the adjacent Ru-O V sites on the Ru-O V /TiO 2 surface serve as active reaction sites, a corresponding model was constructed to simulate the catalyst (Figure S18, Supporting Information).First, the influence of Ru-O V sites on the band structure was examined.Compared to the uniformly distributed valence band (VB) and CB of pristine TiO 2 (Figure S19, Supporting Information), the VB region of Ru-O V /TiO 2 was concentrated around the Ru sites, whereas the CB region was distributed around the O V sites (Figure 5a).Hence, upon photoexcitation of Ru-O V /TiO 2 , photogenerated electrons transition from the Ru sites and accumulate at the O V sites, leaving photogenerated holes at the Ru sites, aligning with previous analyses of photogenerated charge dynamics.Given that Ru sites serve as accumulation points for photogenerated holes, the activation process of H 2 O is calculated on Ru sites (Figure 5b).Although the activation of H 2 O to form protons on TiO 2 and Ru-O V /TiO 2 surfaces is endothermic, introducing Ru sites significantly reduces the dissociation energy of H from H 2 O molecules, accelerating the reduction kinetics of CO 2 to CH 4 .Gibbs free energy calculations were also conducted for potential CO 2 reduction routes.According to the calculation results in Figure 5c,d, the formation of CO intermediates is a rate-limiting step on TiO 2 , whereas introducing Ru-O V sites reduces the formation energy significantly.Most interestingly, as indicated in Section V in Figure 5d (marked in green), the Gibbs free energy of the CHO formation (G(CHO)) is notably lower than the desorption energy of the CO molecules (G( CO)).Specifically, the formation of CHO is an exothermic, spontaneous process, whereas the desorption process of CO is endothermic and involves a significant activation energy barrier.This result implies that the CO intermediate adsorbed on Ru-O V sites is more prone to undergoing protonation to produce CHO rather than desorption, explaining the high selectivity of Ru-O V /TiO 2 for CO 2 photoreduction to CH 4 .In contrast, as demonstrated by the pristine TiO 2 catalyst in Section V of Figure 5c, the formation of CHO requires overcoming a more considerable energy barrier, whereas the desorption of CO is thermodynamically more feasible.Thus, CO can relatively easily desorb from the pristine TiO 2 surface, forming free CO molecules. In brief, for Ru-O V /TiO 2 , the charge-rich and low-coordinated Ru-O V site can serve as a dual-active switch, facilitating the activation of H 2 O and lowering the overall activation energy barrier for CO 2 reduction, promoting the kinetics and thermodynamics of photocatalytic CO 2 methanation.Compared to the pristine TiO 2 with only Ti sites, these Ru-O V sites can form stronger bonds with CO intermediates, converting the originally endothermic protonation step into an exothermic reaction, promoting this conversion step.The strong bonding between CO and Ru-O V sites increases their desorption energy barrier, suppressing the CO production and altering the reaction routes to form CH 4 instead of CO over the Ru-O V /TiO 2 catalyst (Figure 5e)."}], "reaction medium": [{"llm generation": "Gas", "source": "The photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) to methane (CH 4 ) represents a sustainable route for directly converting greenhouse gases into chemicals but poses a significant challenge in achieving high selectivity due to thermodynamic and kinetic limitations during the reaction process.", "context": "The photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) to methane (CH 4 ) represents a sustainable route for directly converting greenhouse gases into chemicals but poses a significant challenge in achieving high selectivity due to thermodynamic and kinetic limitations during the reaction process.This work establishes Ru-O V active sites on the surface of TiO 2 by anchoring coordination unsaturated Ru single-atoms, which stabilize crucial reaction intermediates and facilitate local mass transfer to achieve dual optimization of the thermodynamics and kinetics of the overall photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.Combining operando spectroscopy with density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicates that oxygen vacancies (O V ) inhibits the desorption of CO, whereas Ru facilitates proton extraction.This configuration not only lowers the overall activation energy barrier but has also been engineered to serve as a selectivity switch, changing the reaction route to produce CH 4 instead of CO.Consequently, the Ru-O V /TiO 2 exhibits a 195.4-fold improvement in the CH 4 yield compared to TiO 2 , accompanied by an increase in selectivity to 81."}, {"llm generation": "Gas", "source": "Hence, gaseous products of CH 4 and CO were detected, with no detection of H 2 or any liquid-phase products (e.g., CH 3 OH, HCHO, HCOOH, etc.).", "context": "A series of Ru-O V /TiO 2 catalysts with various Ru loadings were synthesized using a modified impregnation and vacuum sintering method.The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns can be indexed to rutile TiO 2 , and no characteristic peaks of Ru or Ru oxide were observed (Figure S1, Supporting Information).The high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images depict the two-dimensional sheet-like morphology of TiO 2 and Ru-O V /TiO 2 , with exposed (001) crystal facets, and no particles or clusters were observed on the surface of the Ru-O V /TiO 2 nanosheets (Figure S2, Supporting Information).Ultra-high-resolution HAADF-STEM images confirmed the isolated distribution of the Ru species compared to pristine TiO 2 (Figure 1a), where distinct bright spots corresponding to the introduced Ru single atoms were observed on the surface of Ru-O V /TiO 2 (Figure 1b).The Ru species occupy the original Ti sites, indicating the presence of Ru in a substitutional form on the surface of TiO 2 (Figure 1c,d).Moreover, a darker contrast region was observed next to the Ru site, suggesting the presence of adjacent vacancies.Elemental mapping demonstrates the uniform distribution of oxygen, titanium, and ruthenium in the Ru-O V /TiO 2 catalyst (Figure 1e,f), further confirming the isolated dispersed nature of Ru.X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) also observed the introduction of Ru (Figure S3a, Supporting Information), with a noticeable shift in the Ti 2p XPS peak (Figure S3b, Supporting Information), indicating a strong interaction between Ru and the TiO 2 substrate.Introducing Ru results in distinct O V characteristic peaks in the O 1s XPS spectra (Figure 1g), confirming the formation of O V induced by Ru single atoms, further corroborated by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) tests (Figure S4, Supporting Information). To determine the location of the generated O V , we employed DFT calculations to examine the O V formation energy (Figure 1h).The calculation results indicate a substantial decrease in the vacancy formation energy at the two neighboring coordinated O atoms upon introducing single Ru atoms, suggesting the probable formation of O V at these sites (Figure 1i).The density of states (DOS) calculations also indicate that Ru occupies the highest empty orbitals at the Fermi level, confirming the potential for accumulating photogenerated holes (Figure S5, Supporting Information).The introduction of Ru and O V causes a downward shift in the Ti-occupied states in the conduction band (CB), suggesting that photogenerated electrons will UV-vis diffuse reflection spectra (DRS) were employed to evaluate the photo-absorption ability of the photocatalysts (Figure S8a, Supporting Information).Both TiO 2 and Ru-O V /TiO 2 exhibited similar absorption edges at 400 nm with the same band gap of 3.28 eV (Figure S8b, Supporting Information), indicating that modifying Ru-O V sites has little effect on the light harvest, which is not the decisive reason for the improved photocatalytic performance.Moreover, tail adsorption exceeding 400 nm was observed on the Ru-O V /TiO 2 sample, similar to that reported on the vacancy-rich TiO 2 , 27,28 confirming the presence of abundant O V .Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy tests were conducted to investigate the effect of introducing Ru on the charge separation.In Figure S9 (Supporting Information), Ru-O V /TiO 2 exhibited a significantly reduced PL signal compared to pristine TiO 2 , demonstrating enhanced charge separation efficiency.The kinetics of photogenerated electron-hole pairs were assessed to elucidate the positive influence of introducing Ru-O V sites on enhancing photocatalytic efficiency.The transient photocurrent response indicates that constructing Ru-O V is beneficial for increasing the photocurrent intensity of TiO 2 , significantly improving the photogenerated charge transfer efficiency (Figure S10a, Supporting Information).Furthermore, the Nyquist plot of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) under illumination reveals that Ru-O V /TiO 2 presents reduced carrier separation and transfer impedance (Figure S10b, Supporting Information).Therefore, introducing Ru-O V facilitates forming highly separated electronhole states, which is beneficial for enhancing photocatalytic activity.Time-resolved PL spectroscopy further explained the effect of introducing Ru on the charge transfer dynamics (Figure 2h).The slower fluorescence decay of Ru-O V /TiO 2 (26.88 ns) compared to pristine TiO 2 (7.17 ns) implies a more efficient charge separation and transfer. 29,30Further experimental evidence was provided by the solid-state in situ EPR spectra under light irradiation, as illustrated in Figure 2i.For pristine TiO 2 , light irradiation only causes limited signal enhancement, which is attributed to severe charge recombination.However, the EPR signal of Ru-O V /TiO 2 increased by about two-fold under light irradiation, indicating that the Ru-O V site can suppress the charge recombination to enhance the concentration of spin electrons excited to the CB. 313233 In situ high-resolution XPS in the dark and under light irradiation was conducted to investigate the charge transfer direction.Under illumination, the Ti 2p and O 1s XPS peaks display negative and positive shifts, respectively, corresponding to the intrinsic photoexcitation process of TiO 2 (Figure 2j,k).It is worth noting that the binding energy of Ru 3p XPS displays a pos-itive shift, suggesting the accumulation of photogenerated holes at Ru sites, consistent with predictions from previous DFT calculations (Figure 2j).Therefore, these results demonstrate that Ru and its induced O V promote the directional separation of photogenerated charges, forming localized regions enriched with electrons and holes to facilitate CO 2 reduction and H 2 O activation. The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance of prepared catalysts was evaluated in a customized sealed quartz glass reactor under the irradiation of a 300 W Xe lamp.For each reaction, the system was evacuated and filled with CO 2 to adjust the pressure at 70 kPa, followed by adding 500 L of H 2 O as a proton source.Hence, gaseous products of CH 4 and CO were detected, with no detection of H 2 or any liquid-phase products (e.g., CH 3 OH, HCHO, HCOOH, etc.). Figure 3a,b illustrates the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance of the prepared samples.Pristine TiO 2 generates only trace amounts of CH 4 , where CO is the primary photocatalytic CO 2 reduction product, at a rate of 28.8 mol g -1 h -1 .Upon introducing Ru-O V sites, the CH 4 yield significantly increases, accompanied by a decrease in the CO yield.The CH 4 yield reaches its maximum when the Ru loading is 1.22 (50.1 mol g -1 h -1 ), displaying a remarkable increase of 195.4 times that of pristine TiO 2 , whereas the corresponding CO yield decreases to 38 of the pristine TiO 2 .Based on the average product content, the CH 4 selectivity of the optimized Ru-O V /TiO 2 sample is 81, signifying a radical transformation compared to the 1 CH 4 selectivity of TiO 2 (Figure 3c).The considerable changes in product selectivity suggest differences in the CO 2 reduction mechanism and active sites between Ru-O V /TiO 2 and pristine TiO 2 .Subjecting Ru-O V /TiO 2 to heat treatment at 300 C in the air to oxidize its surface OV (i.e., Ru-O V /TiO 2 -oxidized) resulted in a change in selectivity, with a significant decrease in the CH 4 yield accompanied by an increase in the CO yield (Figure 3d).Further heat treatment of the Ru-O V /TiO 2 -oxidized sample under a vacuum to restore its surface O V led to a recovery of its product selectivity toward CH 4 dominance.These observations indicate that O V is a critical factor in modulating product selectivity. Furthermore, the control experiments under other conditions were conducted to confirm the CO 2 photoreduction on Ru-O V /TiO 2 (Figure S11, Supporting Information).In the absence of light, catalysts, or CO 2 , no carbon-containing products can be detected, demonstrating that the observed products were generated from light-driven CO 2 reduction catalyzed by Ru-O V /TiO 2 .Moreover, without adding H 2 O in the reaction system, no products were detected, indicating that CO 2 reduction requires H 2 O as a proton source.Isotopic experiments with 13 CO 2 confirmed that the carbon-containing products were generated from the photoreduction of CO 2 molecules.When the reaction was conducted in a 13 CO 2 atmosphere, only 13 CO and 13 CH 4 were detected, as illustrated in Figure 3e.In addition to its remarkable photocatalytic activity, Ru-O V /TiO 2 has excellent stability.As depicted in Figure S12 (Supporting Information), no noticeable decrease in the activity for CO 2 photoreduction was observed in the cycling tests.The characteristics of Ru-O V /TiO 2 after the continuous reaction remain almost the same as those in the fresh samples (Figure S13, Supporting Information), confirming the excellent stability of the catalyst. The adsorption process of CO 2 on the surfaces was examined to investigate the mechanism of CO 2 photoreduction on Considering that introducing the Ru species reduces the specific surface area of TiO 2 (Figure S14, Supporting Information), we can infer that the two-fold increase in CO 2 adsorption on Ru-O V /TiO 2 surfaces stems from the presence of specific CO 2 adsorption sites.Then, in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) was applied to monitor the process of CO 2 adsorption dynamically on TiO 2 and Ru-O V /TiO 2 .Figure S15 (Supporting Information) displays the characteristic CO 2 adsorption band ( 3 (CO 2 )) with infrared peaks from 3592 to 3728 cm -1 , 34,35 where these intensity changes imply an excellent CO 2 adsorption capacity of the Ru-O V sites.The increased CO 2 adsorption capacity is critical for the photocatalytic reactions on the surface of Ru-O V /TiO 2 .The electron transfer process in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was evidented by using in situ XPS analysis.In Figure S16 (Supporting Information), under illumination, the Ti 2p binding energy shifted negatively by 0.19 eV, whereas the Ru 3p shifted positively by 0.21 eV, indicating the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes at Ru-O V sites.After introducing CO 2 into the system, the Ti 2p binding energy shifted positively by 0.13 eV, whereas the Ru 3p binding energy remained nearly unchanged, suggesting that the photogenerated electrons were transferred from Ti (adjacent to O V ) to CO 2 . An in situ DRIFTS analysis was conducted under reaction conditions to elucidate the structural evolution of the surfaceabsorbed species.Supplementary Table S1 (Supporting Informa-tion) lists the assignments of all band vibration peaks.As depicted in Figure 4a,e, the activation of CO 2 on the catalyst surface initially proceeds with the assistance of H 2 O molecules to generate carbonate species, encompassing three distinct types of characteristic peaks: chelating-bridged carbonate (c-CO 3 2-: 1765 cm -1 ), 36 bidentate carbonate (b-CO 3 2-, with asymmetric CO 3 stretching vibration at 1560 cm -1 and symmetric CO 3 stretching vibration at 1395 cm -1 ), 30,37,38 and monodentate carbonate (m-CO 3 2-: 1541 and 1522 cm -1 ). 39,40Comparing the intensity of the characteristic peaks explained the differences in the initial activation process of CO 2 on the surfaces of TiO 2 and Ru-O V /TiO 2 .Carbonate species on TiO 2 were predominantly present as m-CO 3 2-, confirming the single-point adsorption of CO 2 on individual Ti sites.Upon introducing Ru-O V sites, the characteristic peak of m-CO 3 2-significantly decreased while enhancing the characteristic peaks of b-CO 3 2-and c-CO 3 2-.This finding suggests that Ru-O V sites promote the bridging adsorption of CO 2 molecules, directly altering the reaction routes.The characteristic peak of c-CO 3 2-undergoes a pronounced increase followed by a decrease, indicating that CO 2 on Ru-O V sites has a faster reduction kinetic process.Further, bicarbonate HCO 3 -and formate intermediate COOH were observed, 414243 indicating that the transformation of bicarbonates to formate appears to follow the following route: CO 3 2- HCO 3 - COOH.The formed COOH tends to preserve the initial adsorption state of CO 2 .Therefore, after further hydrogenation and dehydration, CO on the TiO 2 surface desorbs to form CO (Figure 4b), whereas CO on the Ru-O V /TiO 2 surface remains stabilized on Ru-O V sites (Figure 4f). 25,44,45Additionally, vibrational peaks corresponding to CHO, CH 2 O, and CH 3 O were detected on Ru-O V /TiO 2 (Figure 4g), 46474849 which are absent on TiO 2 (Figure 4c 50 In Figure S17a (Supporting Information), the dissociation of D 2 O on TiO 2 leads to two characteristic Ti-OD peaks at 2338 cm -1 and 2373 cm -1 , indicating the dissociation of water molecules at Ti sites on pristine TiO 2 . 47,51In contrast, for Ru-O V /TiO 2 , the original Ti-OD peak intensity weakens, and new characteristic peaks attributed to Ru-OD occur (Figure S17b, Supporting Information), indicating that Ru sites on Ru-O V /TiO 2 are the primary active centers for water activation. 26ased on the preceding analysis, it is evident that CO species, derived from the hydrogenation of the COOH species, is the most crucial intermediate affecting the selectivity of the final products.Its desorption or further hydrogenation corresponds to the production of CO or CH 4 , respectively.Therefore, CO temperature programmed desorption (TPD) testing was conducted to confirm the influence of Ru-O V sites on CO adsorption.As depicted in Figure 4h, pristine TiO 2 has a CO desorption peak at 200 C.However, upon introducing Ru-O V sites, the CO desorption peak shifts to a higher temperature region (600 C), demonstrating the existence of more robust CO adsorption sites on the catalyst surface.The in situ DRIFTS analysis reveals that bridging the adsorption of CO is crucial to significantly improving adsorption stability, inferring that Ru-O V sites serve as the bridging adsorption sites for CO.Then, oxidation was performed on Ru-O V /TiO 2 to remove most of the O V .Under these conditions, the CO desorption peak returned to 200 C, indicating that the Ru sites without O V cannot enhance the adsorption strength of CO, strongly supporting the conclusion that Ru-O V serves as the bridging adsorption site for CO. To provide insights into the nature of the active sites for CO 2 photoreduction with H 2 O over the Ru-O V /TiO 2 catalyst, DFT calculations were conducted to investigate the reaction mechanism.Based on the experimental conclusion that the adjacent Ru-O V sites on the Ru-O V /TiO 2 surface serve as active reaction sites, a corresponding model was constructed to simulate the catalyst (Figure S18, Supporting Information).First, the influence of Ru-O V sites on the band structure was examined.Compared to the uniformly distributed valence band (VB) and CB of pristine TiO 2 (Figure S19, Supporting Information), the VB region of Ru-O V /TiO 2 was concentrated around the Ru sites, whereas the CB region was distributed around the O V sites (Figure 5a).Hence, upon photoexcitation of Ru-O V /TiO 2 , photogenerated electrons transition from the Ru sites and accumulate at the O V sites, leaving photogenerated holes at the Ru sites, aligning with previous analyses of photogenerated charge dynamics.Given that Ru sites serve as accumulation points for photogenerated holes, the activation process of H 2 O is calculated on Ru sites (Figure 5b).Although the activation of H 2 O to form protons on TiO 2 and Ru-O V /TiO 2 surfaces is endothermic, introducing Ru sites significantly reduces the dissociation energy of H from H 2 O molecules, accelerating the reduction kinetics of CO 2 to CH 4 .Gibbs free energy calculations were also conducted for potential CO 2 reduction routes.According to the calculation results in Figure 5c,d, the formation of CO intermediates is a rate-limiting step on TiO 2 , whereas introducing Ru-O V sites reduces the formation energy significantly.Most interestingly, as indicated in Section V in Figure 5d (marked in green), the Gibbs free energy of the CHO formation (G(CHO)) is notably lower than the desorption energy of the CO molecules (G( CO)).Specifically, the formation of CHO is an exothermic, spontaneous process, whereas the desorption process of CO is endothermic and involves a significant activation energy barrier.This result implies that the CO intermediate adsorbed on Ru-O V sites is more prone to undergoing protonation to produce CHO rather than desorption, explaining the high selectivity of Ru-O V /TiO 2 for CO 2 photoreduction to CH 4 .In contrast, as demonstrated by the pristine TiO 2 catalyst in Section V of Figure 5c, the formation of CHO requires overcoming a more considerable energy barrier, whereas the desorption of CO is thermodynamically more feasible.Thus, CO can relatively easily desorb from the pristine TiO 2 surface, forming free CO molecules.

An in situ DRIFTS analysis was conducted under reaction conditions to elucidate the structural evolution of the surfaceabsorbed species.Supplementary Table S1 (Supporting Informa-tion) lists the assignments of all band vibration peaks.As depicted in Figure 4a,e, the activation of CO 2 on the catalyst surface initially proceeds with the assistance of H 2 O molecules to generate carbonate species, encompassing three distinct types of characteristic peaks: chelating-bridged carbonate (c-CO 3 2-: 1765 cm -1 ), 36 bidentate carbonate (b-CO 3 2-, with asymmetric CO 3 stretching vibration at 1560 cm -1 and symmetric CO 3 stretching vibration at 1395 cm -1 ), 30,37,38 and monodentate carbonate (m-CO 3 2-: 1541 and 1522 cm -1 ). 39,40Comparing the intensity of the characteristic peaks explained the differences in the initial activation process of CO 2 on the surfaces of TiO 2 and Ru-O V /TiO 2 .Carbonate species on TiO 2 were predominantly present as m-CO 3 2-, confirming the single-point adsorption of CO 2 on individual Ti sites.Upon introducing Ru-O V sites, the characteristic peak of m-CO 3 2-significantly decreased while enhancing the characteristic peaks of b-CO 3 2-and c-CO 3 2-.This finding suggests that Ru-O V sites promote the bridging adsorption of CO 2 molecules, directly altering the reaction routes.The characteristic peak of c-CO 3 2-undergoes a pronounced increase followed by a decrease, indicating that CO 2 on Ru-O V sites has a faster reduction kinetic process.Further, bicarbonate HCO 3 -and formate intermediate COOH were observed, 414243 indicating that the transformation of bicarbonates to formate appears to follow the following route: CO 3 2- HCO 3 - COOH.The formed COOH tends to preserve the initial adsorption state of CO 2 .Therefore, after further hydrogenation and dehydration, CO on the TiO 2 surface desorbs to form CO (Figure 4b), whereas CO on the Ru-O V /TiO 2 surface remains stabilized on Ru-O V sites (Figure 4f). 25,44,45Additionally, vibrational peaks corresponding to CHO, CH 2 O, and CH 3 O were detected on Ru-O V /TiO 2 (Figure 4g), 46474849 which are absent on TiO 2 (Figure 4c 50 In Figure S17a (Supporting Information), the dissociation of D 2 O on TiO 2 leads to two characteristic Ti-OD peaks at 2338 cm -1 and 2373 cm -1 , indicating the dissociation of water molecules at Ti sites on pristine TiO 2 . 47,51In contrast, for Ru-O V /TiO 2 , the original Ti-OD peak intensity weakens, and new characteristic peaks attributed to Ru-OD occur (Figure S17b, Supporting Information), indicating that Ru sites on Ru-O V /TiO 2 are the primary active centers for water activation. 26ased on the preceding analysis, it is evident that CO species, derived from the hydrogenation of the COOH species, is the most crucial intermediate affecting the selectivity of the final products.Its desorption or further hydrogenation corresponds to the production of CO or CH 4 , respectively.Therefore, CO temperature programmed desorption (TPD) testing was conducted to confirm the influence of Ru-O V sites on CO adsorption.As depicted in Figure 4h, pristine TiO 2 has a CO desorption peak at 200 C.However, upon introducing Ru-O V sites, the CO desorption peak shifts to a higher temperature region (600 C), demonstrating the existence of more robust CO adsorption sites on the catalyst surface.The in situ DRIFTS analysis reveals that bridging the adsorption of CO is crucial to significantly improving adsorption stability, inferring that Ru-O V sites serve as the bridging adsorption sites for CO.Then, oxidation was performed on Ru-O V /TiO 2 to remove most of the O V .Under these conditions, the CO desorption peak returned to 200 C, indicating that the Ru sites without O V cannot enhance the adsorption strength of CO, strongly supporting the conclusion that Ru-O V serves as the bridging adsorption site for CO. To provide insights into the nature of the active sites for CO 2 photoreduction with H 2 O over the Ru-O V /TiO 2 catalyst, DFT calculations were conducted to investigate the reaction mechanism.Based on the experimental conclusion that the adjacent Ru-O V sites on the Ru-O V /TiO 2 surface serve as active reaction sites, a corresponding model was constructed to simulate the catalyst (Figure S18, Supporting Information).First, the influence of Ru-O V sites on the band structure was examined.Compared to the uniformly distributed valence band (VB) and CB of pristine TiO 2 (Figure S19, Supporting Information), the VB region of Ru-O V /TiO 2 was concentrated around the Ru sites, whereas the CB region was distributed around the O V sites (Figure 5a).Hence, upon photoexcitation of Ru-O V /TiO 2 , photogenerated electrons transition from the Ru sites and accumulate at the O V sites, leaving photogenerated holes at the Ru sites, aligning with previous analyses of photogenerated charge dynamics.Given that Ru sites serve as accumulation points for photogenerated holes, the activation process of H 2 O is calculated on Ru sites (Figure 5b).Although the activation of H 2 O to form protons on TiO 2 and Ru-O V /TiO 2 surfaces is endothermic, introducing Ru sites significantly reduces the dissociation energy of H from H 2 O molecules, accelerating the reduction kinetics of CO 2 to CH 4 .Gibbs free energy calculations were also conducted for potential CO 2 reduction routes.According to the calculation results in Figure 5c,d, the formation of CO intermediates is a rate-limiting step on TiO 2 , whereas introducing Ru-O V sites reduces the formation energy significantly.Most interestingly, as indicated in Section V in Figure 5d (marked in green), the Gibbs free energy of the CHO formation (G(CHO)) is notably lower than the desorption energy of the CO molecules (G( CO)).Specifically, the formation of CHO is an exothermic, spontaneous process, whereas the desorption process of CO is endothermic and involves a significant activation energy barrier.This result implies that the CO intermediate adsorbed on Ru-O V sites is more prone to undergoing protonation to produce CHO rather than desorption, explaining the high selectivity of Ru-O V /TiO 2 for CO 2 photoreduction to CH 4 .In contrast, as demonstrated by the pristine TiO 2 catalyst in Section V of Figure 5c, the formation of CHO requires overcoming a more considerable energy barrier, whereas the desorption of CO is thermodynamically more feasible.Thus, CO can relatively easily desorb from the pristine TiO 2 surface, forming free CO molecules. In brief, for Ru-O V /TiO 2 , the charge-rich and low-coordinated Ru-O V site can serve as a dual-active switch, facilitating the activation of H 2 O and lowering the overall activation energy barrier for CO 2 reduction, promoting the kinetics and thermodynamics of photocatalytic CO 2 methanation.Compared to the pristine TiO 2 with only Ti sites, these Ru-O V sites can form stronger bonds with CO intermediates, converting the originally endothermic protonation step into an exothermic reaction, promoting this conversion step.The strong bonding between CO and Ru-O V sites increases their desorption energy barrier, suppressing the CO production and altering the reaction routes to form CH 4 instead of CO over the Ru-O V /TiO 2 catalyst (Figure 5e)."}]}}
