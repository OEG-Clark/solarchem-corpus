Figure S1, Supporting Information), respectively, and the uniform spatial distribution of Cu, Ga and S via EDX spectra (Figure 1b).An 1.4 nm in thickness (Figure 1c) of Ultra-thin CGS/GS was confirmed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) image, which was ascribed to the negative charge environment induced by the ions from cetyltrimethylammonium bromide CTAB strongly adsorbed to the surface of the CGS/GS.In the self-assembly process, the monolayer stack was blocked by coulomb repulsion and the hydrophobic chains of CTAB ions. 6Conclusively, a large number of atomic sites were exposed on the surface of Ultra-thin due to the thickness of a single unit cell CGS/GS slab (1.2 nm).On irradiation, the active surface directly generated holes and electrons in the intermediate layer, both the high active surface and fast charge separation contributed to the excellent photocatalytic performance of Ultra-thin photocatalyst.The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image of CGS/GS (Figure S3, Supporting Information) displayed the lattice fringe distances of CGS particles to be 0.30nm, corresponding to the (1 1 2) crystal plane of tetragonal CGS.In the GS particle, the interplanar distance of 0.19, 0.13, and 0.23 nm can be indexed to the (-4 2 4), (-4 0 4), and (-3 1 2) crystal planes, respectively.Such results suggested that CGS nanoparticles and GS formed composites. 16At the same time, the HRTEM image showed that S vacancy was clearly scanned on the GS (-4 2 4) crystal plane (Figure S2, Supporting Information).The existence of S vacancy (Figure 1e) was confirmed by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and more S vacancies were achieved on the surface of Ultra-thin CuGaS 2 /Ga 2 S 3 due to a sulfur-deficient surface by sharing sulfur atoms. 17he calculated density of states (DOS) of CGS and GS revealed that the CB position of CGS and GS was dominated by Ga 4s orbital, while the VB position of CGS and GS was dominated by Cu 3d orbital and S 3p orbital (Figure 1f,g).Therefore, the position of catalyst CB and VB can be adjusted by changing the Cu/Ga ratio in CGS/GS.X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was recorded and calibrated at C1s (284.8 eV) to verify the changes in the valence state of the photocatalysts.Two peaks positioned at 2p 3/2 (932.2 eV) and 2p 1/2 (952.2eV) in Cu 2p spectrum (Figure 1h) revealed the presence of Cu(I) and Cu(II) ions. 18Binding energy (BE) of Cu (I) shift from 932.1 eV to 932.0 eV was accompanied with BE of Cu (II) shift from 933.0 eV to 932.5 eV confirmed the decrease of copper atoms valence state after the growth of GS on CGS. 19The Cu 2p XPS spectrum (Figure 1h) showed that the binding energy of CGS was slightly reduced after the hybridization of CGS and GS due to the electrons migrated to Cu ions. 20Ga 2p spectrum (Figure 1i) had two peaks at 1118.2 and 1145.0 eV, corresponding to the binding energy of Ga 2p 3/2 and Ga 2p 1/2 , respectively. 16,20The binding energy of composite material CGS/GS (118.2 eV and 1145.0 eV) was shifted to lower than that of single material (CGS:1118.6eV and 1145.5 eV; GS: 1118.7 eV and 1145.6 eV), indicating the electrons migrated to Ga ions after the growth of GS on CGS. 16,20While, the binding energy of Ultra-thin structure (Ultra-thin CGS/GS) continued to shift to lower binding energy (1117.9eV and 1144.9 eV), which was proposed that the fact of Ultra-thin structure was more conducive to the delocalization overflow of sulfur atoms to form a higher concentration of sulfur vacancy (Figure 1e).The resulted further enrichment of electrons around Cu and Ga ions provided a good kinetic advantage for multi-electron reactions.The spin-orbit doublet of S 2p 3/2 (162.0 eV) and S 2p 1/2 (163.3eV; Figure S5, Supporting Information), 16,20 represented the states of S 2-.The S 2p 3/2 peak and S 2p 1/2 peak of GS were 161.0 and 163.4 eV and those of CGS were 162.0 eV and 163.3 eV.The binding energy of composite material CGS/GS (162.0 and 163.3 eV) did not shift significantly compared with that of CGS.While, the binding energy of Ultra-thin structure (Ultra-thin CGS/GS) shifted to lower binding energy (161.7 eV and 163.0 eV), which indicated that the Ultra-thin structure provided a good kinetic advantage for further electron enrichment in multi-electron reactions.The UV-visible absorption properties of the prepared photocatalysts were studied.The absorption of the hybrid photocatalysts was increased with an increase in S vacancy concentration.The band gap energies of CGS and GS nanoparticles were presented by Tauc plots (Figure 1d and Text S1, Supporting Information). 16The band gaps of CGS and GS nanoparticles were 2.23 and 2.87 eV, which were suitable for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction under visible light irradiation.Mott-Schottky plots revealed that the CB edge of CGS, GS were -1.38 and -1.56 eV (vs NHE, pH 7) (Figure S4c, Supporting Information).In order to further investigate the band positions of the synthetic materials, the valence band XPS spectra of CGS and GS were recorded (Figure S21, Supporting Information).The charges transferred from GS to CGS were further confirmed by the VB top of CGS (0.84 eV) was smaller than that of GS (1.34 eV) (Figure S4d, Supporting Information), which was consistent with XPS and KPFM analysis. The gaseous C 2 H 4 , CH 4 , CO, and H 2 were monitored in the process of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, and no other gaseous products were detected.H 2 was also produced as a typical competitive reaction with CO 2 reduction, which also provided preparation for subsequent CO 2 hydrogenation.Consequentially, the C 2 H 4 evolution on Ultra-thin GS/GS showed almost a linear profile with the process of reaction time prolonged to achieve an optimal performance (selectivity of 93.87, yield of 335.67 mol g -1 h -1 ), which was significantly higher than that of CGS/GS, CGS and GS (Figure 2a).Various composite ratios of CGS and GS were obtained and the contrast performances were evaluated by a series of experiments (Figures S11-S14, Supporting Information).The evolution of C 2 H 4 increased with the extension of irradiation time (Figure 2a), which indicated the sustainability of CC coupling capability of Ultra-thin GS/ GS.The product distribution was still the same as that in the absence of TEOA, which suggested that the addition of TEOA enhanced only the reaction rate but did not change the reaction pathway. Compared with 2 electrons to produce CO and 8 electrons to produce CH 4 , the CO 2 reduction product C 2 H 4 required 12 electrons, indicating that the formation of C 2 H 4 was dynamically much harder to occur. 21The recombination of electron and hole pairs on the photocatalyst kept the product from increasing linearly with reaction time prolong.It was feasible to reduce electron and hole pairs recombination by adding TEOA, 22 and it was testified that no photolysis of TEOA in the reaction process by FTIR (Figure S7, Supporting Information).Besides its large specific surface area, it also allowed the rapid transfer of photocarriers to participant the surface reaction, avoiding the recombination of photocarriers predominately.CO was also detected, and the yield of 51.67 mol g -1 h -1 was lower than that of CGS/GS (71.31 mol g -1 h -1 ).From the above analysis, it can be inferred that the Ultra-thin CGS/GS surface preferentially promote the formation of CC coupling products (CHOHCO) from COOH intermediates. To determine the driving force in photocatalytic reaction process, wave-length-dependent photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance of Ultra-thin CGS/GS was measured to evaluate the apparent quantum efficiencies (AQE).The quantum yields of Ultra-thin CGS/GS were measured by monochromatic light at 400 (8.56), 420 (5.64), 450 (4.56), 470 (3.01), 500 (1.71), and 560 nm (1.31), respectively (Figure 2c), suggesting it was a typical photocatalytic driven process.The controlled experiments were carried out in dark and the absence of photocatalyst separately (Figure 2d and Figure S15, Supporting Information), no CO and hydrocarbon products were detected, which proved that the photoreduction of CO 2 was driven by light on Ultra-thin CGS/GS.In the absence of CO 2 , no generation of C 2 H 4 , CH 4 , and CO products, testifying that the carbon source was completely from injected high-purity CO 2 . 7In the absence of H 2 O, no products were detected, proving the hydrogen source came entirely from the added H 2 O.The experiment using isotopelabeled 13 CO 2 was also conducted with TEOA as a hole scavenger, and the products peak sequences of CO, CO 2 , and C 2 H 4 were shown in Figure S20 (Supporting Information), and the ion fragment analysis results of C 2 H 4 peak were displayed in Figure S20a (Supporting Information).The ion fragment peaks for C 2 H 4 were all from 13 CO 2 , demonstrating that the generated C 2 H 4 on Ultra-thin CGS/GS was definitely derived from the reduction of CO 2 rather than other sources. Besides its photocatalytic CO 2 performance, the best Ultrathin CGS/GS sample exhibited significant performance stability during five cycles under visible-light illumination ( 420 nm), with a total test duration of 25 h.The cycling experiment demonstrated that even in the fifth cycle of photoreactions (Figure 2b), the yield of each CO 2 reduction product remained 90 of that in the first cycle, and the overall selectivity of hydrocarbons also remained constant.The crystal structure (XRD), S vacancy (ESR), electrochemical properties (transient photocurrent, EIS), elemental valence and content changes (XPS) of Ultrathin CGS/GS sample before and after the reaction (Figure S16, Supporting Information) were not obvious, indicating that the Ultra-thin CGS/GS possessed a good stability. The electron transport performance played an important role in improving the photocatalytic performance.Ultra-thin CGS/ GS exhibited the most excellent electrochemical properties, such as fast charge separation rate (Figure S6a, Supporting Information), and fast charge transfer rate (Figure S6b,c, Supporting Information), strong photocurrent intensity (Figure S6d, Supporting Information).In order to directly analyze the charge transfer mechanism at the interface, CGS/GS (Figure 3a) and ultra-thin CGS/GS (Figure 3c) were characterized by Kelvin Probe force microscope (KPFM) in the scanning probe microscope (SPM) system under dark and visible-light irradiation ( 420 nm) conditions. 23KPFM images of CGS/GS and Ultra-thin CGS/GS were shown in Figure 3b,d, with GS (position A) distributed at the edge of CGS (position B).The potential at position A of Ultra-thin CGS/GS increased 6.4 mV after light irradiation, while the potential at position B decreased 10.3 mV, indicating that the transfer of electrons from GS to CGS, 24 providing more electrons for CO 2 to produce C 2 H 4 (Figure 3a).The surface potential of CGS (position B) decreased more (10.3mV-Ultra-thin CGS/GS versus 6.6 mV-CGS/GS), indicating that the thin layer structure containing S vacancy can provide more electrons and realize the high concentration of photogenerated electrons on the surface (Figure 3a,c). 25The excess surviving electrons were not only necessary for the photoconversion of CO 2 , but also promoted the adsorption and activation of CO 2 on the surface of the photocatalyst. 7DFT calculations further revealed the regulation of electron structure by S vacancy and the charge transfer at the interface.The calculated charge density difference between CGS and GS (Figure 3g) further confirmed that the existence of the S vacancy in the Ultrathin CGS/GS leaded to charge enrichment on Cu and Ga atoms near the S vacancy.To explore the reason for the high photocatalytic activity on Ultra-thin CGS/GS, the bonding type of ions surrounding to S vacancy was investigated using ELF.The calculated electron localization function plot (Figure 3e) showed that S vacancy induced a highly delocalized electron distribution in the original region of S atoms, which led to the local metallization between Cu and Ga adjacent to S vacancy to form a Cu-Ga metallic bond. 23c23c The Bard charge results (Figure 3f) also showed that the Cu and Ga around the S vacancy enriched electrons.Therefore, Cu-Ga is expected to be used as coupling dual sites to stabilize CHOCO and CHOHCO intermediates, and possibly reduce the energy barrier formed by C 2 H 4 . Since the catalytic behaviors of CO 2 reduction on Cu could be significantly affected by the states of Cu, the stabilized valence state of Cu during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction on Ultra-thin CGS/GS was first determined.The introduced S vacancies led to a rearrangement of the charge distribution in the crystal structure, which affected the copper ions.The various Cu and Cu 2 ratios were studied to explore their roles in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.The Cu /Cu 2 ratio in CGS/GS was 0.5, and the Cu /Cu 2 ratio in Ultra-thin CGS/GS increased to 1.With the increase of Cu ratio, the ethylene yield increased from 176.49 to 335.67 mol g -1 h -1 (Figure 3g).Therefore, the increase of Cu significantly promoted the thermodynamics of CO dimerization, and significantly improved the yield and selectivity of C 2 products (from 92.15 to 93.87).With the Cu / Cu 2 ratio increasing to 2, the yield of ethylene was decreased to 7.83 mol g -1 h -1 (C 1 /C 2 ratio increased from 0.21 to 15.39), because insufficient Cu 2 led to a decrease in the adsorption capacity of intermediate CO. 26In summary, it can be inferred that Cu on the catalyst surface can significantly promote the thermodynamics of CO dimerization, thus leading to significantly improved C 2 product selectivity, and Cu 2 can significantly strengthen the adsorption of CO intermediates, facilitating its further hydrogenation to produce C 2 H 4 . Theoretical calculation and in situ detection technologies were hired to analyze reaction pathway and energy barriers of CO 2 photocatalytic reduction reaction, which were the crucial means and basis for the analysis of multi proton-electron process for the formation of C 2 H 4 in current work.The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction on the surface of Ultra-thin CGS/ GS was monitored via in-situ Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) measurements.It was logical that the peak at 1447 cm -1 was determined to the vibrations of CH 2 CH 2 , 27 indicating the formation of C 2 H 4 as a final production, which was consistence with the result of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction (Figure 4a).Critically, the band at 1314 cm -1 was assigned to the stretching vibration of the OCCHOH intermediate, 7 verifying the OCCHOH was a key intermediate for the coupling of CC bond in the process of photocatalytic reduction on the surface of Ultra-thin CGS/GS, which was demonstrated by Gibbs free energy calculation.The bands located at 1507, 1546, and 1724 cm -1 in the spectra were assigned to the carboxyl intermediate of COOH, 28 and the band located at 2086 cm -1 was assigned to chemisorbed CO (namely CO), respectively. 29he mechanism of photocatalytic selectivity on Ultra-thin CGS/ GS was studied by DFT simulation systematically.The CO 2 and H 2 O molecules were initially adsorbed on the surface of CGS-Vs (Figure 4b,c).The free energy variations of CO activation for photocatalytic CO 2 to CO process on Ultra-thin CGS/ GS surface were calculated to illustrate the pathway (Figure 4d).The limited step of CO production, which turned to be the intermediate of C 2 H 4 generation, was hydrogenation of CO 2 to form COOH intermediate (Free energy: 0.96 eV).Subsequently, the reaction intermediate (COOH) further coupled the proton/electron pair to form CO molecules.Adsorption of CO can be further protonated to form a series of key reaction intermediates with unsaturated coordination in turn, as confirmed by in-situ FTIR measurements (Figure 4a). The mechanism of CC coupling was influenced by the various surface properties of the catalyst intrinsically, and it was also needed to be illustrated urgently for the C 2 H 4 evolution mechanism.The evolution of C 2 H 4 free energy diagrams was summarized and showed that the formation of CO to CHO was considered as a potential determining step (1.35 eV) for the subsequent C-C coupling process (Figure 4g).Herein, the different C-C coupling energy barriers of two unsaturated reaction intermediates (CHO and CHOH) were evaluated (Figure 4e).The free energy of CHOCO formation was 0.12 eV, which was lower than other coupling pathways (CHOHCO was 0.17 eV), however, the coupling energy barrier value (Figure 4f) of CHOHCO (-0.25 eV) was lower than that of CHOCO (0.30 eV), hence the coupling and hydrogenation of CHOHCO can generate C 2 H 4 .The upshift of the d-band center (Figure S18, Supporting Information) of CuGa ions induced by S vacancy can not only enforce the adsorption ability for the intermediates of CHOHCO to initiate CC coupling, but also accumulate electrons to drive the kinetic process of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.In other words, the coupling of CO with CHOH to generate CHOHCO was the most thermodynamically dominant pathway to form the CC bond.Carefully analyzing the molecular structure of the OCCHOH intermediate shows that the CC distance is 1.34 A, and the C-C site is 110-120, so the ideal distance between two active sites for forming the OCCHOH species was 2.6 A.Therefore, the introduction of sulfur vacancies at an appropriate distance around the active site can significantly increase the catalytic activity and C 2 H 4 selectivity."}, {"llm generation": "Ultra-thin CGS/GS", "source": "In conclusion, to enhance the photogeneration efficiency of C 2 H 4 on the Ultra-thin CGS/GS surface, the chemical states of photocatalyst were adjusted successfully via a simple hydrothermal method.", "context": "In conclusion, to enhance the photogeneration efficiency of C 2 H 4 on the Ultra-thin CGS/GS surface, the chemical states of photocatalyst were adjusted successfully via a simple hydrothermal method.The Ultra-thin structure enabled more carriers to move from the interior to the surface and surviving accumulate onto the active site, thus improving the photocatalytic activity.Most importantly, the presence of S vacancy regulated the mechanism of multi proton electron pathway of CO 2 photoreduction process.S vacancy induced a highly delocalized electron distribution, which led to the local metallization between Cu and Ga near the S vacancy to form the Cu-Ga metallic bond as coupling double sites, allowing C 2 H 4 to be the dominant product.This work paves a new way for adjusting the geometric distance of the active sites via the vacancy engineering, which significantly boosted the efficiency of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.CuGaS 2 was prepared by the hydrothermal method.0.025 g Cu 2 O prepared above and 0.0308 g GaCl 3 were added into 40 mL deionized water.After stirring for 15 min, 0.0424 mg of l-cysteine was added into the above suspension followed by stirring for another 15 min.The suspension was transferred to a 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave, and then the autoclave was sealed and maintained at 140 C for 12 h.Finally, the obtained product was washed with deionized water and alcohol for three times each and dried at 60 C for 12 h in a vacuum.Samples were named CGS.

The crystal structure was analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Cu Ka radiation source, D8 Advanced, Bruker, Germany).Raman spectra were performed using LABRAM HR 800 from Jobin Yvon Horiba with 532 nm excitation light.The field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, S-4800, Japan) was used to study the morphology.The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) was performed with an FEI Tecnai G2 F20 and an FEG system at 200 kV.The diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded on a UV-vis spectrophotometer (UV-2700, Shimadzu, Japan).X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo SCIENTIFIC ESCALAB 250XI) was used to analyze demonstrate the chemical compositions and surface states.Room-temperature ESR spectra were measured on an electron spinresonance resonance (ESR, JES-FA 200, JEOL, Japan, 100 kHz, 1.0 mW).The Photoluminescence (PL) properties spectra were measured upon 365 nm incident light by a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Fluorolog-3, HORIBA Scientific, America).CO 2 adsorption isotherms measurements were carried out using an automatic microporous physical and chemical gas adsorption analyzer (NOVA4000E, Kangta).In situ FTIR spectra were acquired using a Thermo Scientific Nicolet 6700, USA. Photocatalytic Measurement: Gas phase photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was carried out in a Pyrex glass reaction cell connected to a glassclosed gas circulation and evacuation system (Shanghai Boyi Scientific Instrument Co. Ltd., China).In the CO 2 photocatalytic process, 20 mg sample was dispersed in quartz paper, and 3 mL deionized water was added into the glass reactor.Triethanolamine (TEOA) was also added into the glass reactor.The instrument was initially vacuum-treated many times to remove residual gases and then pumped with high-purity CO 2 to 70 kPa pressure.A 300 W Xe lamp with a 420 nm cutoff filter ( 420 nm) was used as a light irradiation source.The temperature of the reaction cell was controlled at 283 0.2 K through the recirculating cooling water system during the photocatalytic process.During light irradiation, the gas products (C 2 H 4 , CH 4 , CO) were qualitatively analyzed by an online gas chromatograph (GC-2014C, Shimadzu), and other gas products (H 2 ) were analyzed by an online gas chromatograph (GC-2014C, Shimadzu) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector.0.5 mL productions were taken for testing once an hour.The selectivity of formed productions was deduced according to the following equation: Computational Methods: All calculations were carried out using the density functional theory (DFT) within the generalized-gradient approximation (GGA) with the exchange-correlation functional of Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE).This was implemented in the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP), which spanned reciprocal space with a plane-wave basis and used the projector-augmented wave (PAW) method. For the calculation of DOS of CuGaS 2 and Ga 2 S 3 , 16-atom primitive cell and 20-atom primitive cell were used.The cutoff energy was 500 eV and the Monkhorst-Pack k-point mesh were 4 4 2 and 2 2 3, respectively.The residual forces on atoms were below 0.01 eV A -1 . The slab model was used for calculated of the work function, bader charge and the free energy of different intermediate products.For the CuGaS 2 (110)-Ga 2 S 3 (3-21) interface model, a 1 2 three atomic layer stoichiometric CuGaS 2 (100) surface slab containing 48 atoms was used to match a three atomic layer stoichiometric Ga 2 S 3 (3-21) surface slab containing 38 atoms in a supercell.For the CuGaS 2 (110) surface model, a 22 three-atomic layer surface slab containing 96 atoms was used.For the Ga 2 S 3 (3-21) surface model, a 11 three-atomic layer surface slab containing 60 atoms was used.The Monkhorst-Pack k-point mesh was 2 2 1.A vacuum of 15 A was placed above the slabs to separate the interaction between periodic images.During the relaxations, the atoms at the interface were allowed to relax with an energy convergence of 1 10 -4 eV and forced convergence of 0.05 eV A -1 .Besides, the DFT-D3 www.afm-journal.dewww.advancedsciencenews.com 2023 Wiley-VCH GmbH correction was utilized to treat the van der Waals (vdW) interactions.The Gibbs free energy was calculated: where E ZPE and S were the zero-point energy and the entropy of intermediate products, respectively.

Figure S1, Supporting Information), respectively, and the uniform spatial distribution of Cu, Ga and S via EDX spectra (Figure 1b).An 1.4 nm in thickness (Figure 1c) of Ultra-thin CGS/GS was confirmed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) image, which was ascribed to the negative charge environment induced by the ions from cetyltrimethylammonium bromide CTAB strongly adsorbed to the surface of the CGS/GS.In the self-assembly process, the monolayer stack was blocked by coulomb repulsion and the hydrophobic chains of CTAB ions. 6Conclusively, a large number of atomic sites were exposed on the surface of Ultra-thin due to the thickness of a single unit cell CGS/GS slab (1.2 nm).On irradiation, the active surface directly generated holes and electrons in the intermediate layer, both the high active surface and fast charge separation contributed to the excellent photocatalytic performance of Ultra-thin photocatalyst.The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image of CGS/GS (Figure S3, Supporting Information) displayed the lattice fringe distances of CGS particles to be 0.30nm, corresponding to the (1 1 2) crystal plane of tetragonal CGS.In the GS particle, the interplanar distance of 0.19, 0.13, and 0.23 nm can be indexed to the (-4 2 4), (-4 0 4), and (-3 1 2) crystal planes, respectively.Such results suggested that CGS nanoparticles and GS formed composites. 16At the same time, the HRTEM image showed that S vacancy was clearly scanned on the GS (-4 2 4) crystal plane (Figure S2, Supporting Information).The existence of S vacancy (Figure 1e) was confirmed by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and more S vacancies were achieved on the surface of Ultra-thin CuGaS 2 /Ga 2 S 3 due to a sulfur-deficient surface by sharing sulfur atoms. 17he calculated density of states (DOS) of CGS and GS revealed that the CB position of CGS and GS was dominated by Ga 4s orbital, while the VB position of CGS and GS was dominated by Cu 3d orbital and S 3p orbital (Figure 1f,g).Therefore, the position of catalyst CB and VB can be adjusted by changing the Cu/Ga ratio in CGS/GS.X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was recorded and calibrated at C1s (284.8 eV) to verify the changes in the valence state of the photocatalysts.Two peaks positioned at 2p 3/2 (932.2 eV) and 2p 1/2 (952.2eV) in Cu 2p spectrum (Figure 1h) revealed the presence of Cu(I) and Cu(II) ions. 18Binding energy (BE) of Cu (I) shift from 932.1 eV to 932.0 eV was accompanied with BE of Cu (II) shift from 933.0 eV to 932.5 eV confirmed the decrease of copper atoms valence state after the growth of GS on CGS. 19The Cu 2p XPS spectrum (Figure 1h) showed that the binding energy of CGS was slightly reduced after the hybridization of CGS and GS due to the electrons migrated to Cu ions. 20Ga 2p spectrum (Figure 1i) had two peaks at 1118.2 and 1145.0 eV, corresponding to the binding energy of Ga 2p 3/2 and Ga 2p 1/2 , respectively. 16,20The binding energy of composite material CGS/GS (118.2 eV and 1145.0 eV) was shifted to lower than that of single material (CGS:1118.6eV and 1145.5 eV; GS: 1118.7 eV and 1145.6 eV), indicating the electrons migrated to Ga ions after the growth of GS on CGS. 16,20While, the binding energy of Ultra-thin structure (Ultra-thin CGS/GS) continued to shift to lower binding energy (1117.9eV and 1144.9 eV), which was proposed that the fact of Ultra-thin structure was more conducive to the delocalization overflow of sulfur atoms to form a higher concentration of sulfur vacancy (Figure 1e).The resulted further enrichment of electrons around Cu and Ga ions provided a good kinetic advantage for multi-electron reactions.The spin-orbit doublet of S 2p 3/2 (162.0 eV) and S 2p 1/2 (163.3eV; Figure S5, Supporting Information), 16,20 represented the states of S 2-.The S 2p 3/2 peak and S 2p 1/2 peak of GS were 161.0 and 163.4 eV and those of CGS were 162.0 eV and 163.3 eV.The binding energy of composite material CGS/GS (162.0 and 163.3 eV) did not shift significantly compared with that of CGS.While, the binding energy of Ultra-thin structure (Ultra-thin CGS/GS) shifted to lower binding energy (161.7 eV and 163.0 eV), which indicated that the Ultra-thin structure provided a good kinetic advantage for further electron enrichment in multi-electron reactions.The UV-visible absorption properties of the prepared photocatalysts were studied.The absorption of the hybrid photocatalysts was increased with an increase in S vacancy concentration.The band gap energies of CGS and GS nanoparticles were presented by Tauc plots (Figure 1d and Text S1, Supporting Information). 16The band gaps of CGS and GS nanoparticles were 2.23 and 2.87 eV, which were suitable for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction under visible light irradiation.Mott-Schottky plots revealed that the CB edge of CGS, GS were -1.38 and -1.56 eV (vs NHE, pH 7) (Figure S4c, Supporting Information).In order to further investigate the band positions of the synthetic materials, the valence band XPS spectra of CGS and GS were recorded (Figure S21, Supporting Information).The charges transferred from GS to CGS were further confirmed by the VB top of CGS (0.84 eV) was smaller than that of GS (1.34 eV) (Figure S4d, Supporting Information), which was consistent with XPS and KPFM analysis. The gaseous C 2 H 4 , CH 4 , CO, and H 2 were monitored in the process of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, and no other gaseous products were detected.H 2 was also produced as a typical competitive reaction with CO 2 reduction, which also provided preparation for subsequent CO 2 hydrogenation.Consequentially, the C 2 H 4 evolution on Ultra-thin GS/GS showed almost a linear profile with the process of reaction time prolonged to achieve an optimal performance (selectivity of 93.87, yield of 335.67 mol g -1 h -1 ), which was significantly higher than that of CGS/GS, CGS and GS (Figure 2a).Various composite ratios of CGS and GS were obtained and the contrast performances were evaluated by a series of experiments (Figures S11-S14, Supporting Information).The evolution of C 2 H 4 increased with the extension of irradiation time (Figure 2a), which indicated the sustainability of CC coupling capability of Ultra-thin GS/ GS.The product distribution was still the same as that in the absence of TEOA, which suggested that the addition of TEOA enhanced only the reaction rate but did not change the reaction pathway. Compared with 2 electrons to produce CO and 8 electrons to produce CH 4 , the CO 2 reduction product C 2 H 4 required 12 electrons, indicating that the formation of C 2 H 4 was dynamically much harder to occur. 21The recombination of electron and hole pairs on the photocatalyst kept the product from increasing linearly with reaction time prolong.It was feasible to reduce electron and hole pairs recombination by adding TEOA, 22 and it was testified that no photolysis of TEOA in the reaction process by FTIR (Figure S7, Supporting Information).Besides its large specific surface area, it also allowed the rapid transfer of photocarriers to participant the surface reaction, avoiding the recombination of photocarriers predominately.CO was also detected, and the yield of 51.67 mol g -1 h -1 was lower than that of CGS/GS (71.31 mol g -1 h -1 ).From the above analysis, it can be inferred that the Ultra-thin CGS/GS surface preferentially promote the formation of CC coupling products (CHOHCO) from COOH intermediates. To determine the driving force in photocatalytic reaction process, wave-length-dependent photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance of Ultra-thin CGS/GS was measured to evaluate the apparent quantum efficiencies (AQE).The quantum yields of Ultra-thin CGS/GS were measured by monochromatic light at 400 (8.56), 420 (5.64), 450 (4.56), 470 (3.01), 500 (1.71), and 560 nm (1.31), respectively (Figure 2c), suggesting it was a typical photocatalytic driven process.The controlled experiments were carried out in dark and the absence of photocatalyst separately (Figure 2d and Figure S15, Supporting Information), no CO and hydrocarbon products were detected, which proved that the photoreduction of CO 2 was driven by light on Ultra-thin CGS/GS.In the absence of CO 2 , no generation of C 2 H 4 , CH 4 , and CO products, testifying that the carbon source was completely from injected high-purity CO 2 . 7In the absence of H 2 O, no products were detected, proving the hydrogen source came entirely from the added H 2 O.The experiment using isotopelabeled 13 CO 2 was also conducted with TEOA as a hole scavenger, and the products peak sequences of CO, CO 2 , and C 2 H 4 were shown in Figure S20 (Supporting Information), and the ion fragment analysis results of C 2 H 4 peak were displayed in Figure S20a (Supporting Information).The ion fragment peaks for C 2 H 4 were all from 13 CO 2 , demonstrating that the generated C 2 H 4 on Ultra-thin CGS/GS was definitely derived from the reduction of CO 2 rather than other sources. Besides its photocatalytic CO 2 performance, the best Ultrathin CGS/GS sample exhibited significant performance stability during five cycles under visible-light illumination ( 420 nm), with a total test duration of 25 h.The cycling experiment demonstrated that even in the fifth cycle of photoreactions (Figure 2b), the yield of each CO 2 reduction product remained 90 of that in the first cycle, and the overall selectivity of hydrocarbons also remained constant.The crystal structure (XRD), S vacancy (ESR), electrochemical properties (transient photocurrent, EIS), elemental valence and content changes (XPS) of Ultrathin CGS/GS sample before and after the reaction (Figure S16, Supporting Information) were not obvious, indicating that the Ultra-thin CGS/GS possessed a good stability. The electron transport performance played an important role in improving the photocatalytic performance.Ultra-thin CGS/ GS exhibited the most excellent electrochemical properties, such as fast charge separation rate (Figure S6a, Supporting Information), and fast charge transfer rate (Figure S6b,c, Supporting Information), strong photocurrent intensity (Figure S6d, Supporting Information).In order to directly analyze the charge transfer mechanism at the interface, CGS/GS (Figure 3a) and ultra-thin CGS/GS (Figure 3c) were characterized by Kelvin Probe force microscope (KPFM) in the scanning probe microscope (SPM) system under dark and visible-light irradiation ( 420 nm) conditions. 23KPFM images of CGS/GS and Ultra-thin CGS/GS were shown in Figure 3b,d, with GS (position A) distributed at the edge of CGS (position B).The potential at position A of Ultra-thin CGS/GS increased 6.4 mV after light irradiation, while the potential at position B decreased 10.3 mV, indicating that the transfer of electrons from GS to CGS, 24 providing more electrons for CO 2 to produce C 2 H 4 (Figure 3a).The surface potential of CGS (position B) decreased more (10.3mV-Ultra-thin CGS/GS versus 6.6 mV-CGS/GS), indicating that the thin layer structure containing S vacancy can provide more electrons and realize the high concentration of photogenerated electrons on the surface (Figure 3a,c). 25The excess surviving electrons were not only necessary for the photoconversion of CO 2 , but also promoted the adsorption and activation of CO 2 on the surface of the photocatalyst. 7DFT calculations further revealed the regulation of electron structure by S vacancy and the charge transfer at the interface.The calculated charge density difference between CGS and GS (Figure 3g) further confirmed that the existence of the S vacancy in the Ultrathin CGS/GS leaded to charge enrichment on Cu and Ga atoms near the S vacancy.To explore the reason for the high photocatalytic activity on Ultra-thin CGS/GS, the bonding type of ions surrounding to S vacancy was investigated using ELF.The calculated electron localization function plot (Figure 3e) showed that S vacancy induced a highly delocalized electron distribution in the original region of S atoms, which led to the local metallization between Cu and Ga adjacent to S vacancy to form a Cu-Ga metallic bond. 23c23c The Bard charge results (Figure 3f) also showed that the Cu and Ga around the S vacancy enriched electrons.Therefore, Cu-Ga is expected to be used as coupling dual sites to stabilize CHOCO and CHOHCO intermediates, and possibly reduce the energy barrier formed by C 2 H 4 . Since the catalytic behaviors of CO 2 reduction on Cu could be significantly affected by the states of Cu, the stabilized valence state of Cu during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction on Ultra-thin CGS/GS was first determined.The introduced S vacancies led to a rearrangement of the charge distribution in the crystal structure, which affected the copper ions.The various Cu and Cu 2 ratios were studied to explore their roles in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.The Cu /Cu 2 ratio in CGS/GS was 0.5, and the Cu /Cu 2 ratio in Ultra-thin CGS/GS increased to 1.With the increase of Cu ratio, the ethylene yield increased from 176.49 to 335.67 mol g -1 h -1 (Figure 3g).Therefore, the increase of Cu significantly promoted the thermodynamics of CO dimerization, and significantly improved the yield and selectivity of C 2 products (from 92.15 to 93.87).With the Cu / Cu 2 ratio increasing to 2, the yield of ethylene was decreased to 7.83 mol g -1 h -1 (C 1 /C 2 ratio increased from 0.21 to 15.39), because insufficient Cu 2 led to a decrease in the adsorption capacity of intermediate CO. 26In summary, it can be inferred that Cu on the catalyst surface can significantly promote the thermodynamics of CO dimerization, thus leading to significantly improved C 2 product selectivity, and Cu 2 can significantly strengthen the adsorption of CO intermediates, facilitating its further hydrogenation to produce C 2 H 4 . Theoretical calculation and in situ detection technologies were hired to analyze reaction pathway and energy barriers of CO 2 photocatalytic reduction reaction, which were the crucial means and basis for the analysis of multi proton-electron process for the formation of C 2 H 4 in current work.The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction on the surface of Ultra-thin CGS/ GS was monitored via in-situ Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) measurements.It was logical that the peak at 1447 cm -1 was determined to the vibrations of CH 2 CH 2 , 27 indicating the formation of C 2 H 4 as a final production, which was consistence with the result of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction (Figure 4a).Critically, the band at 1314 cm -1 was assigned to the stretching vibration of the OCCHOH intermediate, 7 verifying the OCCHOH was a key intermediate for the coupling of CC bond in the process of photocatalytic reduction on the surface of Ultra-thin CGS/GS, which was demonstrated by Gibbs free energy calculation.The bands located at 1507, 1546, and 1724 cm -1 in the spectra were assigned to the carboxyl intermediate of COOH, 28 and the band located at 2086 cm -1 was assigned to chemisorbed CO (namely CO), respectively. 29he mechanism of photocatalytic selectivity on Ultra-thin CGS/ GS was studied by DFT simulation systematically.The CO 2 and H 2 O molecules were initially adsorbed on the surface of CGS-Vs (Figure 4b,c).The free energy variations of CO activation for photocatalytic CO 2 to CO process on Ultra-thin CGS/ GS surface were calculated to illustrate the pathway (Figure 4d).The limited step of CO production, which turned to be the intermediate of C 2 H 4 generation, was hydrogenation of CO 2 to form COOH intermediate (Free energy: 0.96 eV).Subsequently, the reaction intermediate (COOH) further coupled the proton/electron pair to form CO molecules.Adsorption of CO can be further protonated to form a series of key reaction intermediates with unsaturated coordination in turn, as confirmed by in-situ FTIR measurements (Figure 4a). The mechanism of CC coupling was influenced by the various surface properties of the catalyst intrinsically, and it was also needed to be illustrated urgently for the C 2 H 4 evolution mechanism.The evolution of C 2 H 4 free energy diagrams was summarized and showed that the formation of CO to CHO was considered as a potential determining step (1.35 eV) for the subsequent C-C coupling process (Figure 4g).Herein, the different C-C coupling energy barriers of two unsaturated reaction intermediates (CHO and CHOH) were evaluated (Figure 4e).The free energy of CHOCO formation was 0.12 eV, which was lower than other coupling pathways (CHOHCO was 0.17 eV), however, the coupling energy barrier value (Figure 4f) of CHOHCO (-0.25 eV) was lower than that of CHOCO (0.30 eV), hence the coupling and hydrogenation of CHOHCO can generate C 2 H 4 .The upshift of the d-band center (Figure S18, Supporting Information) of CuGa ions induced by S vacancy can not only enforce the adsorption ability for the intermediates of CHOHCO to initiate CC coupling, but also accumulate electrons to drive the kinetic process of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.In other words, the coupling of CO with CHOH to generate CHOHCO was the most thermodynamically dominant pathway to form the CC bond.Carefully analyzing the molecular structure of the OCCHOH intermediate shows that the CC distance is 1.34 A, and the C-C site is 110-120, so the ideal distance between two active sites for forming the OCCHOH species was 2.6 A.Therefore, the introduction of sulfur vacancies at an appropriate distance around the active site can significantly increase the catalytic activity and C 2 H 4 selectivity."}, {"llm generation": "Triethanolamine (TEOA)", "source": "Triethanolamine (TEOA) was also added into the glass reactor.", "context": "In conclusion, to enhance the photogeneration efficiency of C 2 H 4 on the Ultra-thin CGS/GS surface, the chemical states of photocatalyst were adjusted successfully via a simple hydrothermal method.The Ultra-thin structure enabled more carriers to move from the interior to the surface and surviving accumulate onto the active site, thus improving the photocatalytic activity.Most importantly, the presence of S vacancy regulated the mechanism of multi proton electron pathway of CO 2 photoreduction process.S vacancy induced a highly delocalized electron distribution, which led to the local metallization between Cu and Ga near the S vacancy to form the Cu-Ga metallic bond as coupling double sites, allowing C 2 H 4 to be the dominant product.This work paves a new way for adjusting the geometric distance of the active sites via the vacancy engineering, which significantly boosted the efficiency of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.CuGaS 2 was prepared by the hydrothermal method.0.025 g Cu 2 O prepared above and 0.0308 g GaCl 3 were added into 40 mL deionized water.After stirring for 15 min, 0.0424 mg of l-cysteine was added into the above suspension followed by stirring for another 15 min.The suspension was transferred to a 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave, and then the autoclave was sealed and maintained at 140 C for 12 h.Finally, the obtained product was washed with deionized water and alcohol for three times each and dried at 60 C for 12 h in a vacuum.Samples were named CGS.

The crystal structure was analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Cu Ka radiation source, D8 Advanced, Bruker, Germany).Raman spectra were performed using LABRAM HR 800 from Jobin Yvon Horiba with 532 nm excitation light.The field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, S-4800, Japan) was used to study the morphology.The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) was performed with an FEI Tecnai G2 F20 and an FEG system at 200 kV.The diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded on a UV-vis spectrophotometer (UV-2700, Shimadzu, Japan).X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo SCIENTIFIC ESCALAB 250XI) was used to analyze demonstrate the chemical compositions and surface states.Room-temperature ESR spectra were measured on an electron spinresonance resonance (ESR, JES-FA 200, JEOL, Japan, 100 kHz, 1.0 mW).The Photoluminescence (PL) properties spectra were measured upon 365 nm incident light by a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Fluorolog-3, HORIBA Scientific, America).CO 2 adsorption isotherms measurements were carried out using an automatic microporous physical and chemical gas adsorption analyzer (NOVA4000E, Kangta).In situ FTIR spectra were acquired using a Thermo Scientific Nicolet 6700, USA. Photocatalytic Measurement: Gas phase photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was carried out in a Pyrex glass reaction cell connected to a glassclosed gas circulation and evacuation system (Shanghai Boyi Scientific Instrument Co. Ltd., China).In the CO 2 photocatalytic process, 20 mg sample was dispersed in quartz paper, and 3 mL deionized water was added into the glass reactor.Triethanolamine (TEOA) was also added into the glass reactor.The instrument was initially vacuum-treated many times to remove residual gases and then pumped with high-purity CO 2 to 70 kPa pressure.A 300 W Xe lamp with a 420 nm cutoff filter ( 420 nm) was used as a light irradiation source.The temperature of the reaction cell was controlled at 283 0.2 K through the recirculating cooling water system during the photocatalytic process.During light irradiation, the gas products (C 2 H 4 , CH 4 , CO) were qualitatively analyzed by an online gas chromatograph (GC-2014C, Shimadzu), and other gas products (H 2 ) were analyzed by an online gas chromatograph (GC-2014C, Shimadzu) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector.0.5 mL productions were taken for testing once an hour.The selectivity of formed productions was deduced according to the following equation: Computational Methods: All calculations were carried out using the density functional theory (DFT) within the generalized-gradient approximation (GGA) with the exchange-correlation functional of Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE).This was implemented in the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP), which spanned reciprocal space with a plane-wave basis and used the projector-augmented wave (PAW) method. For the calculation of DOS of CuGaS 2 and Ga 2 S 3 , 16-atom primitive cell and 20-atom primitive cell were used.The cutoff energy was 500 eV and the Monkhorst-Pack k-point mesh were 4 4 2 and 2 2 3, respectively.The residual forces on atoms were below 0.01 eV A -1 . The slab model was used for calculated of the work function, bader charge and the free energy of different intermediate products.For the CuGaS 2 (110)-Ga 2 S 3 (3-21) interface model, a 1 2 three atomic layer stoichiometric CuGaS 2 (100) surface slab containing 48 atoms was used to match a three atomic layer stoichiometric Ga 2 S 3 (3-21) surface slab containing 38 atoms in a supercell.For the CuGaS 2 (110) surface model, a 22 three-atomic layer surface slab containing 96 atoms was used.For the Ga 2 S 3 (3-21) surface model, a 11 three-atomic layer surface slab containing 60 atoms was used.The Monkhorst-Pack k-point mesh was 2 2 1.A vacuum of 15 A was placed above the slabs to separate the interaction between periodic images.During the relaxations, the atoms at the interface were allowed to relax with an energy convergence of 1 10 -4 eV and forced convergence of 0.05 eV A -1 .Besides, the DFT-D3 www.afm-journal.dewww.advancedsciencenews.com 2023 Wiley-VCH GmbH correction was utilized to treat the van der Waals (vdW) interactions.The Gibbs free energy was calculated: where E ZPE and S were the zero-point energy and the entropy of intermediate products, respectively.

Figure S1, Supporting Information), respectively, and the uniform spatial distribution of Cu, Ga and S via EDX spectra (Figure 1b).An 1.4 nm in thickness (Figure 1c) of Ultra-thin CGS/GS was confirmed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) image, which was ascribed to the negative charge environment induced by the ions from cetyltrimethylammonium bromide CTAB strongly adsorbed to the surface of the CGS/GS.In the self-assembly process, the monolayer stack was blocked by coulomb repulsion and the hydrophobic chains of CTAB ions. 6Conclusively, a large number of atomic sites were exposed on the surface of Ultra-thin due to the thickness of a single unit cell CGS/GS slab (1.2 nm).On irradiation, the active surface directly generated holes and electrons in the intermediate layer, both the high active surface and fast charge separation contributed to the excellent photocatalytic performance of Ultra-thin photocatalyst.The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image of CGS/GS (Figure S3, Supporting Information) displayed the lattice fringe distances of CGS particles to be 0.30nm, corresponding to the (1 1 2) crystal plane of tetragonal CGS.In the GS particle, the interplanar distance of 0.19, 0.13, and 0.23 nm can be indexed to the (-4 2 4), (-4 0 4), and (-3 1 2) crystal planes, respectively.Such results suggested that CGS nanoparticles and GS formed composites. 16At the same time, the HRTEM image showed that S vacancy was clearly scanned on the GS (-4 2 4) crystal plane (Figure S2, Supporting Information).The existence of S vacancy (Figure 1e) was confirmed by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and more S vacancies were achieved on the surface of Ultra-thin CuGaS 2 /Ga 2 S 3 due to a sulfur-deficient surface by sharing sulfur atoms. 17he calculated density of states (DOS) of CGS and GS revealed that the CB position of CGS and GS was dominated by Ga 4s orbital, while the VB position of CGS and GS was dominated by Cu 3d orbital and S 3p orbital (Figure 1f,g).Therefore, the position of catalyst CB and VB can be adjusted by changing the Cu/Ga ratio in CGS/GS.X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was recorded and calibrated at C1s (284.8 eV) to verify the changes in the valence state of the photocatalysts.Two peaks positioned at 2p 3/2 (932.2 eV) and 2p 1/2 (952.2eV) in Cu 2p spectrum (Figure 1h) revealed the presence of Cu(I) and Cu(II) ions. 18Binding energy (BE) of Cu (I) shift from 932.1 eV to 932.0 eV was accompanied with BE of Cu (II) shift from 933.0 eV to 932.5 eV confirmed the decrease of copper atoms valence state after the growth of GS on CGS. 19The Cu 2p XPS spectrum (Figure 1h) showed that the binding energy of CGS was slightly reduced after the hybridization of CGS and GS due to the electrons migrated to Cu ions. 20Ga 2p spectrum (Figure 1i) had two peaks at 1118.2 and 1145.0 eV, corresponding to the binding energy of Ga 2p 3/2 and Ga 2p 1/2 , respectively. 16,20The binding energy of composite material CGS/GS (118.2 eV and 1145.0 eV) was shifted to lower than that of single material (CGS:1118.6eV and 1145.5 eV; GS: 1118.7 eV and 1145.6 eV), indicating the electrons migrated to Ga ions after the growth of GS on CGS. 16,20While, the binding energy of Ultra-thin structure (Ultra-thin CGS/GS) continued to shift to lower binding energy (1117.9eV and 1144.9 eV), which was proposed that the fact of Ultra-thin structure was more conducive to the delocalization overflow of sulfur atoms to form a higher concentration of sulfur vacancy (Figure 1e).The resulted further enrichment of electrons around Cu and Ga ions provided a good kinetic advantage for multi-electron reactions.The spin-orbit doublet of S 2p 3/2 (162.0 eV) and S 2p 1/2 (163.3eV; Figure S5, Supporting Information), 16,20 represented the states of S 2-.The S 2p 3/2 peak and S 2p 1/2 peak of GS were 161.0 and 163.4 eV and those of CGS were 162.0 eV and 163.3 eV.The binding energy of composite material CGS/GS (162.0 and 163.3 eV) did not shift significantly compared with that of CGS.While, the binding energy of Ultra-thin structure (Ultra-thin CGS/GS) shifted to lower binding energy (161.7 eV and 163.0 eV), which indicated that the Ultra-thin structure provided a good kinetic advantage for further electron enrichment in multi-electron reactions.The UV-visible absorption properties of the prepared photocatalysts were studied.The absorption of the hybrid photocatalysts was increased with an increase in S vacancy concentration.The band gap energies of CGS and GS nanoparticles were presented by Tauc plots (Figure 1d and Text S1, Supporting Information). 16The band gaps of CGS and GS nanoparticles were 2.23 and 2.87 eV, which were suitable for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction under visible light irradiation.Mott-Schottky plots revealed that the CB edge of CGS, GS were -1.38 and -1.56 eV (vs NHE, pH 7) (Figure S4c, Supporting Information).In order to further investigate the band positions of the synthetic materials, the valence band XPS spectra of CGS and GS were recorded (Figure S21, Supporting Information).The charges transferred from GS to CGS were further confirmed by the VB top of CGS (0.84 eV) was smaller than that of GS (1.34 eV) (Figure S4d, Supporting Information), which was consistent with XPS and KPFM analysis. The gaseous C 2 H 4 , CH 4 , CO, and H 2 were monitored in the process of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, and no other gaseous products were detected.H 2 was also produced as a typical competitive reaction with CO 2 reduction, which also provided preparation for subsequent CO 2 hydrogenation.Consequentially, the C 2 H 4 evolution on Ultra-thin GS/GS showed almost a linear profile with the process of reaction time prolonged to achieve an optimal performance (selectivity of 93.87, yield of 335.67 mol g -1 h -1 ), which was significantly higher than that of CGS/GS, CGS and GS (Figure 2a).Various composite ratios of CGS and GS were obtained and the contrast performances were evaluated by a series of experiments (Figures S11-S14, Supporting Information).The evolution of C 2 H 4 increased with the extension of irradiation time (Figure 2a), which indicated the sustainability of CC coupling capability of Ultra-thin GS/ GS.The product distribution was still the same as that in the absence of TEOA, which suggested that the addition of TEOA enhanced only the reaction rate but did not change the reaction pathway. Compared with 2 electrons to produce CO and 8 electrons to produce CH 4 , the CO 2 reduction product C 2 H 4 required 12 electrons, indicating that the formation of C 2 H 4 was dynamically much harder to occur. 21The recombination of electron and hole pairs on the photocatalyst kept the product from increasing linearly with reaction time prolong.It was feasible to reduce electron and hole pairs recombination by adding TEOA, 22 and it was testified that no photolysis of TEOA in the reaction process by FTIR (Figure S7, Supporting Information).Besides its large specific surface area, it also allowed the rapid transfer of photocarriers to participant the surface reaction, avoiding the recombination of photocarriers predominately.CO was also detected, and the yield of 51.67 mol g -1 h -1 was lower than that of CGS/GS (71.31 mol g -1 h -1 ).From the above analysis, it can be inferred that the Ultra-thin CGS/GS surface preferentially promote the formation of CC coupling products (CHOHCO) from COOH intermediates. To determine the driving force in photocatalytic reaction process, wave-length-dependent photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance of Ultra-thin CGS/GS was measured to evaluate the apparent quantum efficiencies (AQE).The quantum yields of Ultra-thin CGS/GS were measured by monochromatic light at 400 (8.56), 420 (5.64), 450 (4.56), 470 (3.01), 500 (1.71), and 560 nm (1.31), respectively (Figure 2c), suggesting it was a typical photocatalytic driven process.The controlled experiments were carried out in dark and the absence of photocatalyst separately (Figure 2d and Figure S15, Supporting Information), no CO and hydrocarbon products were detected, which proved that the photoreduction of CO 2 was driven by light on Ultra-thin CGS/GS.In the absence of CO 2 , no generation of C 2 H 4 , CH 4 , and CO products, testifying that the carbon source was completely from injected high-purity CO 2 . 7In the absence of H 2 O, no products were detected, proving the hydrogen source came entirely from the added H 2 O.The experiment using isotopelabeled 13 CO 2 was also conducted with TEOA as a hole scavenger, and the products peak sequences of CO, CO 2 , and C 2 H 4 were shown in Figure S20 (Supporting Information), and the ion fragment analysis results of C 2 H 4 peak were displayed in Figure S20a (Supporting Information).The ion fragment peaks for C 2 H 4 were all from 13 CO 2 , demonstrating that the generated C 2 H 4 on Ultra-thin CGS/GS was definitely derived from the reduction of CO 2 rather than other sources. Besides its photocatalytic CO 2 performance, the best Ultrathin CGS/GS sample exhibited significant performance stability during five cycles under visible-light illumination ( 420 nm), with a total test duration of 25 h.The cycling experiment demonstrated that even in the fifth cycle of photoreactions (Figure 2b), the yield of each CO 2 reduction product remained 90 of that in the first cycle, and the overall selectivity of hydrocarbons also remained constant.The crystal structure (XRD), S vacancy (ESR), electrochemical properties (transient photocurrent, EIS), elemental valence and content changes (XPS) of Ultrathin CGS/GS sample before and after the reaction (Figure S16, Supporting Information) were not obvious, indicating that the Ultra-thin CGS/GS possessed a good stability. The electron transport performance played an important role in improving the photocatalytic performance.Ultra-thin CGS/ GS exhibited the most excellent electrochemical properties, such as fast charge separation rate (Figure S6a, Supporting Information), and fast charge transfer rate (Figure S6b,c, Supporting Information), strong photocurrent intensity (Figure S6d, Supporting Information).In order to directly analyze the charge transfer mechanism at the interface, CGS/GS (Figure 3a) and ultra-thin CGS/GS (Figure 3c) were characterized by Kelvin Probe force microscope (KPFM) in the scanning probe microscope (SPM) system under dark and visible-light irradiation ( 420 nm) conditions. 23KPFM images of CGS/GS and Ultra-thin CGS/GS were shown in Figure 3b,d, with GS (position A) distributed at the edge of CGS (position B).The potential at position A of Ultra-thin CGS/GS increased 6.4 mV after light irradiation, while the potential at position B decreased 10.3 mV, indicating that the transfer of electrons from GS to CGS, 24 providing more electrons for CO 2 to produce C 2 H 4 (Figure 3a).The surface potential of CGS (position B) decreased more (10.3mV-Ultra-thin CGS/GS versus 6.6 mV-CGS/GS), indicating that the thin layer structure containing S vacancy can provide more electrons and realize the high concentration of photogenerated electrons on the surface (Figure 3a,c). 25The excess surviving electrons were not only necessary for the photoconversion of CO 2 , but also promoted the adsorption and activation of CO 2 on the surface of the photocatalyst. 7DFT calculations further revealed the regulation of electron structure by S vacancy and the charge transfer at the interface.The calculated charge density difference between CGS and GS (Figure 3g) further confirmed that the existence of the S vacancy in the Ultrathin CGS/GS leaded to charge enrichment on Cu and Ga atoms near the S vacancy.To explore the reason for the high photocatalytic activity on Ultra-thin CGS/GS, the bonding type of ions surrounding to S vacancy was investigated using ELF.The calculated electron localization function plot (Figure 3e) showed that S vacancy induced a highly delocalized electron distribution in the original region of S atoms, which led to the local metallization between Cu and Ga adjacent to S vacancy to form a Cu-Ga metallic bond. 23c23c The Bard charge results (Figure 3f) also showed that the Cu and Ga around the S vacancy enriched electrons.Therefore, Cu-Ga is expected to be used as coupling dual sites to stabilize CHOCO and CHOHCO intermediates, and possibly reduce the energy barrier formed by C 2 H 4 . Since the catalytic behaviors of CO 2 reduction on Cu could be significantly affected by the states of Cu, the stabilized valence state of Cu during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction on Ultra-thin CGS/GS was first determined.The introduced S vacancies led to a rearrangement of the charge distribution in the crystal structure, which affected the copper ions.The various Cu and Cu 2 ratios were studied to explore their roles in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.The Cu /Cu 2 ratio in CGS/GS was 0.5, and the Cu /Cu 2 ratio in Ultra-thin CGS/GS increased to 1.With the increase of Cu ratio, the ethylene yield increased from 176.49 to 335.67 mol g -1 h -1 (Figure 3g).Therefore, the increase of Cu significantly promoted the thermodynamics of CO dimerization, and significantly improved the yield and selectivity of C 2 products (from 92.15 to 93.87).With the Cu / Cu 2 ratio increasing to 2, the yield of ethylene was decreased to 7.83 mol g -1 h -1 (C 1 /C 2 ratio increased from 0.21 to 15.39), because insufficient Cu 2 led to a decrease in the adsorption capacity of intermediate CO. 26In summary, it can be inferred that Cu on the catalyst surface can significantly promote the thermodynamics of CO dimerization, thus leading to significantly improved C 2 product selectivity, and Cu 2 can significantly strengthen the adsorption of CO intermediates, facilitating its further hydrogenation to produce C 2 H 4 . Theoretical calculation and in situ detection technologies were hired to analyze reaction pathway and energy barriers of CO 2 photocatalytic reduction reaction, which were the crucial means and basis for the analysis of multi proton-electron process for the formation of C 2 H 4 in current work.The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction on the surface of Ultra-thin CGS/ GS was monitored via in-situ Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) measurements.It was logical that the peak at 1447 cm -1 was determined to the vibrations of CH 2 CH 2 , 27 indicating the formation of C 2 H 4 as a final production, which was consistence with the result of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction (Figure 4a).Critically, the band at 1314 cm -1 was assigned to the stretching vibration of the OCCHOH intermediate, 7 verifying the OCCHOH was a key intermediate for the coupling of CC bond in the process of photocatalytic reduction on the surface of Ultra-thin CGS/GS, which was demonstrated by Gibbs free energy calculation.The bands located at 1507, 1546, and 1724 cm -1 in the spectra were assigned to the carboxyl intermediate of COOH, 28 and the band located at 2086 cm -1 was assigned to chemisorbed CO (namely CO), respectively. 29he mechanism of photocatalytic selectivity on Ultra-thin CGS/ GS was studied by DFT simulation systematically.The CO 2 and H 2 O molecules were initially adsorbed on the surface of CGS-Vs (Figure 4b,c).The free energy variations of CO activation for photocatalytic CO 2 to CO process on Ultra-thin CGS/ GS surface were calculated to illustrate the pathway (Figure 4d).The limited step of CO production, which turned to be the intermediate of C 2 H 4 generation, was hydrogenation of CO 2 to form COOH intermediate (Free energy: 0.96 eV).Subsequently, the reaction intermediate (COOH) further coupled the proton/electron pair to form CO molecules.Adsorption of CO can be further protonated to form a series of key reaction intermediates with unsaturated coordination in turn, as confirmed by in-situ FTIR measurements (Figure 4a). The mechanism of CC coupling was influenced by the various surface properties of the catalyst intrinsically, and it was also needed to be illustrated urgently for the C 2 H 4 evolution mechanism.The evolution of C 2 H 4 free energy diagrams was summarized and showed that the formation of CO to CHO was considered as a potential determining step (1.35 eV) for the subsequent C-C coupling process (Figure 4g).Herein, the different C-C coupling energy barriers of two unsaturated reaction intermediates (CHO and CHOH) were evaluated (Figure 4e).The free energy of CHOCO formation was 0.12 eV, which was lower than other coupling pathways (CHOHCO was 0.17 eV), however, the coupling energy barrier value (Figure 4f) of CHOHCO (-0.25 eV) was lower than that of CHOCO (0.30 eV), hence the coupling and hydrogenation of CHOHCO can generate C 2 H 4 .The upshift of the d-band center (Figure S18, Supporting Information) of CuGa ions induced by S vacancy can not only enforce the adsorption ability for the intermediates of CHOHCO to initiate CC coupling, but also accumulate electrons to drive the kinetic process of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.In other words, the coupling of CO with CHOH to generate CHOHCO was the most thermodynamically dominant pathway to form the CC bond.Carefully analyzing the molecular structure of the OCCHOH intermediate shows that the CC distance is 1.34 A, and the C-C site is 110-120, so the ideal distance between two active sites for forming the OCCHOH species was 2.6 A.Therefore, the introduction of sulfur vacancies at an appropriate distance around the active site can significantly increase the catalytic activity and C 2 H 4 selectivity."}, {"llm generation": "UV-Vis", "source": "A 300 W Xe lamp with a 420 nm cutoff filter ( 420 nm) was used as a light irradiation source.", "context": "In conclusion, to enhance the photogeneration efficiency of C 2 H 4 on the Ultra-thin CGS/GS surface, the chemical states of photocatalyst were adjusted successfully via a simple hydrothermal method.The Ultra-thin structure enabled more carriers to move from the interior to the surface and surviving accumulate onto the active site, thus improving the photocatalytic activity.Most importantly, the presence of S vacancy regulated the mechanism of multi proton electron pathway of CO 2 photoreduction process.S vacancy induced a highly delocalized electron distribution, which led to the local metallization between Cu and Ga near the S vacancy to form the Cu-Ga metallic bond as coupling double sites, allowing C 2 H 4 to be the dominant product.This work paves a new way for adjusting the geometric distance of the active sites via the vacancy engineering, which significantly boosted the efficiency of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.CuGaS 2 was prepared by the hydrothermal method.0.025 g Cu 2 O prepared above and 0.0308 g GaCl 3 were added into 40 mL deionized water.After stirring for 15 min, 0.0424 mg of l-cysteine was added into the above suspension followed by stirring for another 15 min.The suspension was transferred to a 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave, and then the autoclave was sealed and maintained at 140 C for 12 h.Finally, the obtained product was washed with deionized water and alcohol for three times each and dried at 60 C for 12 h in a vacuum.Samples were named CGS.

The crystal structure was analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Cu Ka radiation source, D8 Advanced, Bruker, Germany).Raman spectra were performed using LABRAM HR 800 from Jobin Yvon Horiba with 532 nm excitation light.The field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, S-4800, Japan) was used to study the morphology.The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) was performed with an FEI Tecnai G2 F20 and an FEG system at 200 kV.The diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded on a UV-vis spectrophotometer (UV-2700, Shimadzu, Japan).X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo SCIENTIFIC ESCALAB 250XI) was used to analyze demonstrate the chemical compositions and surface states.Room-temperature ESR spectra were measured on an electron spinresonance resonance (ESR, JES-FA 200, JEOL, Japan, 100 kHz, 1.0 mW).The Photoluminescence (PL) properties spectra were measured upon 365 nm incident light by a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Fluorolog-3, HORIBA Scientific, America).CO 2 adsorption isotherms measurements were carried out using an automatic microporous physical and chemical gas adsorption analyzer (NOVA4000E, Kangta).In situ FTIR spectra were acquired using a Thermo Scientific Nicolet 6700, USA. Photocatalytic Measurement: Gas phase photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was carried out in a Pyrex glass reaction cell connected to a glassclosed gas circulation and evacuation system (Shanghai Boyi Scientific Instrument Co. Ltd., China).In the CO 2 photocatalytic process, 20 mg sample was dispersed in quartz paper, and 3 mL deionized water was added into the glass reactor.Triethanolamine (TEOA) was also added into the glass reactor.The instrument was initially vacuum-treated many times to remove residual gases and then pumped with high-purity CO 2 to 70 kPa pressure.A 300 W Xe lamp with a 420 nm cutoff filter ( 420 nm) was used as a light irradiation source.The temperature of the reaction cell was controlled at 283 0.2 K through the recirculating cooling water system during the photocatalytic process.During light irradiation, the gas products (C 2 H 4 , CH 4 , CO) were qualitatively analyzed by an online gas chromatograph (GC-2014C, Shimadzu), and other gas products (H 2 ) were analyzed by an online gas chromatograph (GC-2014C, Shimadzu) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector.0.5 mL productions were taken for testing once an hour.The selectivity of formed productions was deduced according to the following equation: Computational Methods: All calculations were carried out using the density functional theory (DFT) within the generalized-gradient approximation (GGA) with the exchange-correlation functional of Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE).This was implemented in the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP), which spanned reciprocal space with a plane-wave basis and used the projector-augmented wave (PAW) method. For the calculation of DOS of CuGaS 2 and Ga 2 S 3 , 16-atom primitive cell and 20-atom primitive cell were used.The cutoff energy was 500 eV and the Monkhorst-Pack k-point mesh were 4 4 2 and 2 2 3, respectively.The residual forces on atoms were below 0.01 eV A -1 .

The crystal structure was analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Cu Ka radiation source, D8 Advanced, Bruker, Germany).Raman spectra were performed using LABRAM HR 800 from Jobin Yvon Horiba with 532 nm excitation light.The field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, S-4800, Japan) was used to study the morphology.The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) was performed with an FEI Tecnai G2 F20 and an FEG system at 200 kV.The diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded on a UV-vis spectrophotometer (UV-2700, Shimadzu, Japan).X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo SCIENTIFIC ESCALAB 250XI) was used to analyze demonstrate the chemical compositions and surface states.Room-temperature ESR spectra were measured on an electron spinresonance resonance (ESR, JES-FA 200, JEOL, Japan, 100 kHz, 1.0 mW).The Photoluminescence (PL) properties spectra were measured upon 365 nm incident light by a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Fluorolog-3, HORIBA Scientific, America).CO 2 adsorption isotherms measurements were carried out using an automatic microporous physical and chemical gas adsorption analyzer (NOVA4000E, Kangta).In situ FTIR spectra were acquired using a Thermo Scientific Nicolet 6700, USA. Photocatalytic Measurement: Gas phase photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was carried out in a Pyrex glass reaction cell connected to a glassclosed gas circulation and evacuation system (Shanghai Boyi Scientific Instrument Co. Ltd., China).In the CO 2 photocatalytic process, 20 mg sample was dispersed in quartz paper, and 3 mL deionized water was added into the glass reactor.Triethanolamine (TEOA) was also added into the glass reactor.The instrument was initially vacuum-treated many times to remove residual gases and then pumped with high-purity CO 2 to 70 kPa pressure.A 300 W Xe lamp with a 420 nm cutoff filter ( 420 nm) was used as a light irradiation source.The temperature of the reaction cell was controlled at 283 0.2 K through the recirculating cooling water system during the photocatalytic process.During light irradiation, the gas products (C 2 H 4 , CH 4 , CO) were qualitatively analyzed by an online gas chromatograph (GC-2014C, Shimadzu), and other gas products (H 2 ) were analyzed by an online gas chromatograph (GC-2014C, Shimadzu) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector.0.5 mL productions were taken for testing once an hour.The selectivity of formed productions was deduced according to the following equation: Computational Methods: All calculations were carried out using the density functional theory (DFT) within the generalized-gradient approximation (GGA) with the exchange-correlation functional of Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE).This was implemented in the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP), which spanned reciprocal space with a plane-wave basis and used the projector-augmented wave (PAW) method. For the calculation of DOS of CuGaS 2 and Ga 2 S 3 , 16-atom primitive cell and 20-atom primitive cell were used.The cutoff energy was 500 eV and the Monkhorst-Pack k-point mesh were 4 4 2 and 2 2 3, respectively.The residual forces on atoms were below 0.01 eV A -1 . The slab model was used for calculated of the work function, bader charge and the free energy of different intermediate products.For the CuGaS 2 (110)-Ga 2 S 3 (3-21) interface model, a 1 2 three atomic layer stoichiometric CuGaS 2 (100) surface slab containing 48 atoms was used to match a three atomic layer stoichiometric Ga 2 S 3 (3-21) surface slab containing 38 atoms in a supercell.For the CuGaS 2 (110) surface model, a 22 three-atomic layer surface slab containing 96 atoms was used.For the Ga 2 S 3 (3-21) surface model, a 11 three-atomic layer surface slab containing 60 atoms was used.The Monkhorst-Pack k-point mesh was 2 2 1.A vacuum of 15 A was placed above the slabs to separate the interaction between periodic images.During the relaxations, the atoms at the interface were allowed to relax with an energy convergence of 1 10 -4 eV and forced convergence of 0.05 eV A -1 .Besides, the DFT-D3 www.afm-journal.dewww.advancedsciencenews.com 2023 Wiley-VCH GmbH correction was utilized to treat the van der Waals (vdW) interactions.The Gibbs free energy was calculated: where E ZPE and S were the zero-point energy and the entropy of intermediate products, respectively.

Figure S1, Supporting Information), respectively, and the uniform spatial distribution of Cu, Ga and S via EDX spectra (Figure 1b).An 1.4 nm in thickness (Figure 1c) of Ultra-thin CGS/GS was confirmed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) image, which was ascribed to the negative charge environment induced by the ions from cetyltrimethylammonium bromide CTAB strongly adsorbed to the surface of the CGS/GS.In the self-assembly process, the monolayer stack was blocked by coulomb repulsion and the hydrophobic chains of CTAB ions. 6Conclusively, a large number of atomic sites were exposed on the surface of Ultra-thin due to the thickness of a single unit cell CGS/GS slab (1.2 nm).On irradiation, the active surface directly generated holes and electrons in the intermediate layer, both the high active surface and fast charge separation contributed to the excellent photocatalytic performance of Ultra-thin photocatalyst.The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image of CGS/GS (Figure S3, Supporting Information) displayed the lattice fringe distances of CGS particles to be 0.30nm, corresponding to the (1 1 2) crystal plane of tetragonal CGS.In the GS particle, the interplanar distance of 0.19, 0.13, and 0.23 nm can be indexed to the (-4 2 4), (-4 0 4), and (-3 1 2) crystal planes, respectively.Such results suggested that CGS nanoparticles and GS formed composites. 16At the same time, the HRTEM image showed that S vacancy was clearly scanned on the GS (-4 2 4) crystal plane (Figure S2, Supporting Information).The existence of S vacancy (Figure 1e) was confirmed by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and more S vacancies were achieved on the surface of Ultra-thin CuGaS 2 /Ga 2 S 3 due to a sulfur-deficient surface by sharing sulfur atoms. 17he calculated density of states (DOS) of CGS and GS revealed that the CB position of CGS and GS was dominated by Ga 4s orbital, while the VB position of CGS and GS was dominated by Cu 3d orbital and S 3p orbital (Figure 1f,g).Therefore, the position of catalyst CB and VB can be adjusted by changing the Cu/Ga ratio in CGS/GS.X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was recorded and calibrated at C1s (284.8 eV) to verify the changes in the valence state of the photocatalysts.Two peaks positioned at 2p 3/2 (932.2 eV) and 2p 1/2 (952.2eV) in Cu 2p spectrum (Figure 1h) revealed the presence of Cu(I) and Cu(II) ions. 18Binding energy (BE) of Cu (I) shift from 932.1 eV to 932.0 eV was accompanied with BE of Cu (II) shift from 933.0 eV to 932.5 eV confirmed the decrease of copper atoms valence state after the growth of GS on CGS. 19The Cu 2p XPS spectrum (Figure 1h) showed that the binding energy of CGS was slightly reduced after the hybridization of CGS and GS due to the electrons migrated to Cu ions. 20Ga 2p spectrum (Figure 1i) had two peaks at 1118.2 and 1145.0 eV, corresponding to the binding energy of Ga 2p 3/2 and Ga 2p 1/2 , respectively. 16,20The binding energy of composite material CGS/GS (118.2 eV and 1145.0 eV) was shifted to lower than that of single material (CGS:1118.6eV and 1145.5 eV; GS: 1118.7 eV and 1145.6 eV), indicating the electrons migrated to Ga ions after the growth of GS on CGS. 16,20While, the binding energy of Ultra-thin structure (Ultra-thin CGS/GS) continued to shift to lower binding energy (1117.9eV and 1144.9 eV), which was proposed that the fact of Ultra-thin structure was more conducive to the delocalization overflow of sulfur atoms to form a higher concentration of sulfur vacancy (Figure 1e).The resulted further enrichment of electrons around Cu and Ga ions provided a good kinetic advantage for multi-electron reactions.The spin-orbit doublet of S 2p 3/2 (162.0 eV) and S 2p 1/2 (163.3eV; Figure S5, Supporting Information), 16,20 represented the states of S 2-.The S 2p 3/2 peak and S 2p 1/2 peak of GS were 161.0 and 163.4 eV and those of CGS were 162.0 eV and 163.3 eV.The binding energy of composite material CGS/GS (162.0 and 163.3 eV) did not shift significantly compared with that of CGS.While, the binding energy of Ultra-thin structure (Ultra-thin CGS/GS) shifted to lower binding energy (161.7 eV and 163.0 eV), which indicated that the Ultra-thin structure provided a good kinetic advantage for further electron enrichment in multi-electron reactions.The UV-visible absorption properties of the prepared photocatalysts were studied.The absorption of the hybrid photocatalysts was increased with an increase in S vacancy concentration.The band gap energies of CGS and GS nanoparticles were presented by Tauc plots (Figure 1d and Text S1, Supporting Information). 16The band gaps of CGS and GS nanoparticles were 2.23 and 2.87 eV, which were suitable for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction under visible light irradiation.Mott-Schottky plots revealed that the CB edge of CGS, GS were -1.38 and -1.56 eV (vs NHE, pH 7) (Figure S4c, Supporting Information).In order to further investigate the band positions of the synthetic materials, the valence band XPS spectra of CGS and GS were recorded (Figure S21, Supporting Information).The charges transferred from GS to CGS were further confirmed by the VB top of CGS (0.84 eV) was smaller than that of GS (1.34 eV) (Figure S4d, Supporting Information), which was consistent with XPS and KPFM analysis. The gaseous C 2 H 4 , CH 4 , CO, and H 2 were monitored in the process of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, and no other gaseous products were detected.H 2 was also produced as a typical competitive reaction with CO 2 reduction, which also provided preparation for subsequent CO 2 hydrogenation.Consequentially, the C 2 H 4 evolution on Ultra-thin GS/GS showed almost a linear profile with the process of reaction time prolonged to achieve an optimal performance (selectivity of 93.87, yield of 335.67 mol g -1 h -1 ), which was significantly higher than that of CGS/GS, CGS and GS (Figure 2a).Various composite ratios of CGS and GS were obtained and the contrast performances were evaluated by a series of experiments (Figures S11-S14, Supporting Information).The evolution of C 2 H 4 increased with the extension of irradiation time (Figure 2a), which indicated the sustainability of CC coupling capability of Ultra-thin GS/ GS.The product distribution was still the same as that in the absence of TEOA, which suggested that the addition of TEOA enhanced only the reaction rate but did not change the reaction pathway. Compared with 2 electrons to produce CO and 8 electrons to produce CH 4 , the CO 2 reduction product C 2 H 4 required 12 electrons, indicating that the formation of C 2 H 4 was dynamically much harder to occur. 21The recombination of electron and hole pairs on the photocatalyst kept the product from increasing linearly with reaction time prolong.It was feasible to reduce electron and hole pairs recombination by adding TEOA, 22 and it was testified that no photolysis of TEOA in the reaction process by FTIR (Figure S7, Supporting Information).Besides its large specific surface area, it also allowed the rapid transfer of photocarriers to participant the surface reaction, avoiding the recombination of photocarriers predominately.CO was also detected, and the yield of 51.67 mol g -1 h -1 was lower than that of CGS/GS (71.31 mol g -1 h -1 ).From the above analysis, it can be inferred that the Ultra-thin CGS/GS surface preferentially promote the formation of CC coupling products (CHOHCO) from COOH intermediates. To determine the driving force in photocatalytic reaction process, wave-length-dependent photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance of Ultra-thin CGS/GS was measured to evaluate the apparent quantum efficiencies (AQE).The quantum yields of Ultra-thin CGS/GS were measured by monochromatic light at 400 (8.56), 420 (5.64), 450 (4.56), 470 (3.01), 500 (1.71), and 560 nm (1.31), respectively (Figure 2c), suggesting it was a typical photocatalytic driven process.The controlled experiments were carried out in dark and the absence of photocatalyst separately (Figure 2d and Figure S15, Supporting Information), no CO and hydrocarbon products were detected, which proved that the photoreduction of CO 2 was driven by light on Ultra-thin CGS/GS.In the absence of CO 2 , no generation of C 2 H 4 , CH 4 , and CO products, testifying that the carbon source was completely from injected high-purity CO 2 . 7In the absence of H 2 O, no products were detected, proving the hydrogen source came entirely from the added H 2 O.The experiment using isotopelabeled 13 CO 2 was also conducted with TEOA as a hole scavenger, and the products peak sequences of CO, CO 2 , and C 2 H 4 were shown in Figure S20 (Supporting Information), and the ion fragment analysis results of C 2 H 4 peak were displayed in Figure S20a (Supporting Information).The ion fragment peaks for C 2 H 4 were all from 13 CO 2 , demonstrating that the generated C 2 H 4 on Ultra-thin CGS/GS was definitely derived from the reduction of CO 2 rather than other sources. Besides its photocatalytic CO 2 performance, the best Ultrathin CGS/GS sample exhibited significant performance stability during five cycles under visible-light illumination ( 420 nm), with a total test duration of 25 h.The cycling experiment demonstrated that even in the fifth cycle of photoreactions (Figure 2b), the yield of each CO 2 reduction product remained 90 of that in the first cycle, and the overall selectivity of hydrocarbons also remained constant.The crystal structure (XRD), S vacancy (ESR), electrochemical properties (transient photocurrent, EIS), elemental valence and content changes (XPS) of Ultrathin CGS/GS sample before and after the reaction (Figure S16, Supporting Information) were not obvious, indicating that the Ultra-thin CGS/GS possessed a good stability. The electron transport performance played an important role in improving the photocatalytic performance.Ultra-thin CGS/ GS exhibited the most excellent electrochemical properties, such as fast charge separation rate (Figure S6a, Supporting Information), and fast charge transfer rate (Figure S6b,c, Supporting Information), strong photocurrent intensity (Figure S6d, Supporting Information).In order to directly analyze the charge transfer mechanism at the interface, CGS/GS (Figure 3a) and ultra-thin CGS/GS (Figure 3c) were characterized by Kelvin Probe force microscope (KPFM) in the scanning probe microscope (SPM) system under dark and visible-light irradiation ( 420 nm) conditions. 23KPFM images of CGS/GS and Ultra-thin CGS/GS were shown in Figure 3b,d, with GS (position A) distributed at the edge of CGS (position B).The potential at position A of Ultra-thin CGS/GS increased 6.4 mV after light irradiation, while the potential at position B decreased 10.3 mV, indicating that the transfer of electrons from GS to CGS, 24 providing more electrons for CO 2 to produce C 2 H 4 (Figure 3a).The surface potential of CGS (position B) decreased more (10.3mV-Ultra-thin CGS/GS versus 6.6 mV-CGS/GS), indicating that the thin layer structure containing S vacancy can provide more electrons and realize the high concentration of photogenerated electrons on the surface (Figure 3a,c). 25The excess surviving electrons were not only necessary for the photoconversion of CO 2 , but also promoted the adsorption and activation of CO 2 on the surface of the photocatalyst. 7DFT calculations further revealed the regulation of electron structure by S vacancy and the charge transfer at the interface.The calculated charge density difference between CGS and GS (Figure 3g) further confirmed that the existence of the S vacancy in the Ultrathin CGS/GS leaded to charge enrichment on Cu and Ga atoms near the S vacancy.To explore the reason for the high photocatalytic activity on Ultra-thin CGS/GS, the bonding type of ions surrounding to S vacancy was investigated using ELF.The calculated electron localization function plot (Figure 3e) showed that S vacancy induced a highly delocalized electron distribution in the original region of S atoms, which led to the local metallization between Cu and Ga adjacent to S vacancy to form a Cu-Ga metallic bond. 23c23c The Bard charge results (Figure 3f) also showed that the Cu and Ga around the S vacancy enriched electrons.Therefore, Cu-Ga is expected to be used as coupling dual sites to stabilize CHOCO and CHOHCO intermediates, and possibly reduce the energy barrier formed by C 2 H 4 . Since the catalytic behaviors of CO 2 reduction on Cu could be significantly affected by the states of Cu, the stabilized valence state of Cu during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction on Ultra-thin CGS/GS was first determined.The introduced S vacancies led to a rearrangement of the charge distribution in the crystal structure, which affected the copper ions.The various Cu and Cu 2 ratios were studied to explore their roles in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.The Cu /Cu 2 ratio in CGS/GS was 0.5, and the Cu /Cu 2 ratio in Ultra-thin CGS/GS increased to 1.With the increase of Cu ratio, the ethylene yield increased from 176.49 to 335.67 mol g -1 h -1 (Figure 3g).Therefore, the increase of Cu significantly promoted the thermodynamics of CO dimerization, and significantly improved the yield and selectivity of C 2 products (from 92.15 to 93.87).With the Cu / Cu 2 ratio increasing to 2, the yield of ethylene was decreased to 7.83 mol g -1 h -1 (C 1 /C 2 ratio increased from 0.21 to 15.39), because insufficient Cu 2 led to a decrease in the adsorption capacity of intermediate CO. 26In summary, it can be inferred that Cu on the catalyst surface can significantly promote the thermodynamics of CO dimerization, thus leading to significantly improved C 2 product selectivity, and Cu 2 can significantly strengthen the adsorption of CO intermediates, facilitating its further hydrogenation to produce C 2 H 4 . Theoretical calculation and in situ detection technologies were hired to analyze reaction pathway and energy barriers of CO 2 photocatalytic reduction reaction, which were the crucial means and basis for the analysis of multi proton-electron process for the formation of C 2 H 4 in current work.The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction on the surface of Ultra-thin CGS/ GS was monitored via in-situ Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) measurements.It was logical that the peak at 1447 cm -1 was determined to the vibrations of CH 2 CH 2 , 27 indicating the formation of C 2 H 4 as a final production, which was consistence with the result of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction (Figure 4a).Critically, the band at 1314 cm -1 was assigned to the stretching vibration of the OCCHOH intermediate, 7 verifying the OCCHOH was a key intermediate for the coupling of CC bond in the process of photocatalytic reduction on the surface of Ultra-thin CGS/GS, which was demonstrated by Gibbs free energy calculation.The bands located at 1507, 1546, and 1724 cm -1 in the spectra were assigned to the carboxyl intermediate of COOH, 28 and the band located at 2086 cm -1 was assigned to chemisorbed CO (namely CO), respectively. 29he mechanism of photocatalytic selectivity on Ultra-thin CGS/ GS was studied by DFT simulation systematically.The CO 2 and H 2 O molecules were initially adsorbed on the surface of CGS-Vs (Figure 4b,c).The free energy variations of CO activation for photocatalytic CO 2 to CO process on Ultra-thin CGS/ GS surface were calculated to illustrate the pathway (Figure 4d).The limited step of CO production, which turned to be the intermediate of C 2 H 4 generation, was hydrogenation of CO 2 to form COOH intermediate (Free energy: 0.96 eV).Subsequently, the reaction intermediate (COOH) further coupled the proton/electron pair to form CO molecules.Adsorption of CO can be further protonated to form a series of key reaction intermediates with unsaturated coordination in turn, as confirmed by in-situ FTIR measurements (Figure 4a). The mechanism of CC coupling was influenced by the various surface properties of the catalyst intrinsically, and it was also needed to be illustrated urgently for the C 2 H 4 evolution mechanism.The evolution of C 2 H 4 free energy diagrams was summarized and showed that the formation of CO to CHO was considered as a potential determining step (1.35 eV) for the subsequent C-C coupling process (Figure 4g).Herein, the different C-C coupling energy barriers of two unsaturated reaction intermediates (CHO and CHOH) were evaluated (Figure 4e).The free energy of CHOCO formation was 0.12 eV, which was lower than other coupling pathways (CHOHCO was 0.17 eV), however, the coupling energy barrier value (Figure 4f) of CHOHCO (-0.25 eV) was lower than that of CHOCO (0.30 eV), hence the coupling and hydrogenation of CHOHCO can generate C 2 H 4 .The upshift of the d-band center (Figure S18, Supporting Information) of CuGa ions induced by S vacancy can not only enforce the adsorption ability for the intermediates of CHOHCO to initiate CC coupling, but also accumulate electrons to drive the kinetic process of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.In other words, the coupling of CO with CHOH to generate CHOHCO was the most thermodynamically dominant pathway to form the CC bond.Carefully analyzing the molecular structure of the OCCHOH intermediate shows that the CC distance is 1.34 A, and the C-C site is 110-120, so the ideal distance between two active sites for forming the OCCHOH species was 2.6 A.Therefore, the introduction of sulfur vacancies at an appropriate distance around the active site can significantly increase the catalytic activity and C 2 H 4 selectivity."}, {"llm generation": "Gas", "source": "Gas phase photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was carried out in a Pyrex glass reaction cell connected to a glassclosed gas circulation and evacuation system (Shanghai Boyi Scientific Instrument Co.

Figure S1, Supporting Information), respectively, and the uniform spatial distribution of Cu, Ga and S via EDX spectra (Figure 1b).An 1.4 nm in thickness (Figure 1c) of Ultra-thin CGS/GS was confirmed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) image, which was ascribed to the negative charge environment induced by the ions from cetyltrimethylammonium bromide CTAB strongly adsorbed to the surface of the CGS/GS.In the self-assembly process, the monolayer stack was blocked by coulomb repulsion and the hydrophobic chains of CTAB ions. 6Conclusively, a large number of atomic sites were exposed on the surface of Ultra-thin due to the thickness of a single unit cell CGS/GS slab (1.2 nm).On irradiation, the active surface directly generated holes and electrons in the intermediate layer, both the high active surface and fast charge separation contributed to the excellent photocatalytic performance of Ultra-thin photocatalyst.The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image of CGS/GS (Figure S3, Supporting Information) displayed the lattice fringe distances of CGS particles to be 0.30nm, corresponding to the (1 1 2) crystal plane of tetragonal CGS.In the GS particle, the interplanar distance of 0.19, 0.13, and 0.23 nm can be indexed to the (-4 2 4), (-4 0 4), and (-3 1 2) crystal planes, respectively.Such results suggested that CGS nanoparticles and GS formed composites. 16At the same time, the HRTEM image showed that S vacancy was clearly scanned on the GS (-4 2 4) crystal plane (Figure S2, Supporting Information).The existence of S vacancy (Figure 1e) was confirmed by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and more S vacancies were achieved on the surface of Ultra-thin CuGaS 2 /Ga 2 S 3 due to a sulfur-deficient surface by sharing sulfur atoms. 17he calculated density of states (DOS) of CGS and GS revealed that the CB position of CGS and GS was dominated by Ga 4s orbital, while the VB position of CGS and GS was dominated by Cu 3d orbital and S 3p orbital (Figure 1f,g).Therefore, the position of catalyst CB and VB can be adjusted by changing the Cu/Ga ratio in CGS/GS.X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was recorded and calibrated at C1s (284.8 eV) to verify the changes in the valence state of the photocatalysts.Two peaks positioned at 2p 3/2 (932.2 eV) and 2p 1/2 (952.2eV) in Cu 2p spectrum (Figure 1h) revealed the presence of Cu(I) and Cu(II) ions. 18Binding energy (BE) of Cu (I) shift from 932.1 eV to 932.0 eV was accompanied with BE of Cu (II) shift from 933.0 eV to 932.5 eV confirmed the decrease of copper atoms valence state after the growth of GS on CGS. 19The Cu 2p XPS spectrum (Figure 1h) showed that the binding energy of CGS was slightly reduced after the hybridization of CGS and GS due to the electrons migrated to Cu ions. 20Ga 2p spectrum (Figure 1i) had two peaks at 1118.2 and 1145.0 eV, corresponding to the binding energy of Ga 2p 3/2 and Ga 2p 1/2 , respectively. 16,20The binding energy of composite material CGS/GS (118.2 eV and 1145.0 eV) was shifted to lower than that of single material (CGS:1118.6eV and 1145.5 eV; GS: 1118.7 eV and 1145.6 eV), indicating the electrons migrated to Ga ions after the growth of GS on CGS. 16,20While, the binding energy of Ultra-thin structure (Ultra-thin CGS/GS) continued to shift to lower binding energy (1117.9eV and 1144.9 eV), which was proposed that the fact of Ultra-thin structure was more conducive to the delocalization overflow of sulfur atoms to form a higher concentration of sulfur vacancy (Figure 1e).The resulted further enrichment of electrons around Cu and Ga ions provided a good kinetic advantage for multi-electron reactions.The spin-orbit doublet of S 2p 3/2 (162.0 eV) and S 2p 1/2 (163.3eV; Figure S5, Supporting Information), 16,20 represented the states of S 2-.The S 2p 3/2 peak and S 2p 1/2 peak of GS were 161.0 and 163.4 eV and those of CGS were 162.0 eV and 163.3 eV.The binding energy of composite material CGS/GS (162.0 and 163.3 eV) did not shift significantly compared with that of CGS.While, the binding energy of Ultra-thin structure (Ultra-thin CGS/GS) shifted to lower binding energy (161.7 eV and 163.0 eV), which indicated that the Ultra-thin structure provided a good kinetic advantage for further electron enrichment in multi-electron reactions.The UV-visible absorption properties of the prepared photocatalysts were studied.The absorption of the hybrid photocatalysts was increased with an increase in S vacancy concentration.The band gap energies of CGS and GS nanoparticles were presented by Tauc plots (Figure 1d and Text S1, Supporting Information). 16The band gaps of CGS and GS nanoparticles were 2.23 and 2.87 eV, which were suitable for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction under visible light irradiation.Mott-Schottky plots revealed that the CB edge of CGS, GS were -1.38 and -1.56 eV (vs NHE, pH 7) (Figure S4c, Supporting Information).In order to further investigate the band positions of the synthetic materials, the valence band XPS spectra of CGS and GS were recorded (Figure S21, Supporting Information).The charges transferred from GS to CGS were further confirmed by the VB top of CGS (0.84 eV) was smaller than that of GS (1.34 eV) (Figure S4d, Supporting Information), which was consistent with XPS and KPFM analysis. The gaseous C 2 H 4 , CH 4 , CO, and H 2 were monitored in the process of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, and no other gaseous products were detected.H 2 was also produced as a typical competitive reaction with CO 2 reduction, which also provided preparation for subsequent CO 2 hydrogenation.Consequentially, the C 2 H 4 evolution on Ultra-thin GS/GS showed almost a linear profile with the process of reaction time prolonged to achieve an optimal performance (selectivity of 93.87, yield of 335.67 mol g -1 h -1 ), which was significantly higher than that of CGS/GS, CGS and GS (Figure 2a).Various composite ratios of CGS and GS were obtained and the contrast performances were evaluated by a series of experiments (Figures S11-S14, Supporting Information).The evolution of C 2 H 4 increased with the extension of irradiation time (Figure 2a), which indicated the sustainability of CC coupling capability of Ultra-thin GS/ GS.The product distribution was still the same as that in the absence of TEOA, which suggested that the addition of TEOA enhanced only the reaction rate but did not change the reaction pathway. Compared with 2 electrons to produce CO and 8 electrons to produce CH 4 , the CO 2 reduction product C 2 H 4 required 12 electrons, indicating that the formation of C 2 H 4 was dynamically much harder to occur. 21The recombination of electron and hole pairs on the photocatalyst kept the product from increasing linearly with reaction time prolong.It was feasible to reduce electron and hole pairs recombination by adding TEOA, 22 and it was testified that no photolysis of TEOA in the reaction process by FTIR (Figure S7, Supporting Information).Besides its large specific surface area, it also allowed the rapid transfer of photocarriers to participant the surface reaction, avoiding the recombination of photocarriers predominately.CO was also detected, and the yield of 51.67 mol g -1 h -1 was lower than that of CGS/GS (71.31 mol g -1 h -1 ).From the above analysis, it can be inferred that the Ultra-thin CGS/GS surface preferentially promote the formation of CC coupling products (CHOHCO) from COOH intermediates. To determine the driving force in photocatalytic reaction process, wave-length-dependent photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance of Ultra-thin CGS/GS was measured to evaluate the apparent quantum efficiencies (AQE).The quantum yields of Ultra-thin CGS/GS were measured by monochromatic light at 400 (8.56), 420 (5.64), 450 (4.56), 470 (3.01), 500 (1.71), and 560 nm (1.31), respectively (Figure 2c), suggesting it was a typical photocatalytic driven process.The controlled experiments were carried out in dark and the absence of photocatalyst separately (Figure 2d and Figure S15, Supporting Information), no CO and hydrocarbon products were detected, which proved that the photoreduction of CO 2 was driven by light on Ultra-thin CGS/GS.In the absence of CO 2 , no generation of C 2 H 4 , CH 4 , and CO products, testifying that the carbon source was completely from injected high-purity CO 2 . 7In the absence of H 2 O, no products were detected, proving the hydrogen source came entirely from the added H 2 O.The experiment using isotopelabeled 13 CO 2 was also conducted with TEOA as a hole scavenger, and the products peak sequences of CO, CO 2 , and C 2 H 4 were shown in Figure S20 (Supporting Information), and the ion fragment analysis results of C 2 H 4 peak were displayed in Figure S20a (Supporting Information).The ion fragment peaks for C 2 H 4 were all from 13 CO 2 , demonstrating that the generated C 2 H 4 on Ultra-thin CGS/GS was definitely derived from the reduction of CO 2 rather than other sources. Besides its photocatalytic CO 2 performance, the best Ultrathin CGS/GS sample exhibited significant performance stability during five cycles under visible-light illumination ( 420 nm), with a total test duration of 25 h.The cycling experiment demonstrated that even in the fifth cycle of photoreactions (Figure 2b), the yield of each CO 2 reduction product remained 90 of that in the first cycle, and the overall selectivity of hydrocarbons also remained constant.The crystal structure (XRD), S vacancy (ESR), electrochemical properties (transient photocurrent, EIS), elemental valence and content changes (XPS) of Ultrathin CGS/GS sample before and after the reaction (Figure S16, Supporting Information) were not obvious, indicating that the Ultra-thin CGS/GS possessed a good stability. The electron transport performance played an important role in improving the photocatalytic performance.Ultra-thin CGS/ GS exhibited the most excellent electrochemical properties, such as fast charge separation rate (Figure S6a, Supporting Information), and fast charge transfer rate (Figure S6b,c, Supporting Information), strong photocurrent intensity (Figure S6d, Supporting Information).In order to directly analyze the charge transfer mechanism at the interface, CGS/GS (Figure 3a) and ultra-thin CGS/GS (Figure 3c) were characterized by Kelvin Probe force microscope (KPFM) in the scanning probe microscope (SPM) system under dark and visible-light irradiation ( 420 nm) conditions. 23KPFM images of CGS/GS and Ultra-thin CGS/GS were shown in Figure 3b,d, with GS (position A) distributed at the edge of CGS (position B).The potential at position A of Ultra-thin CGS/GS increased 6.4 mV after light irradiation, while the potential at position B decreased 10.3 mV, indicating that the transfer of electrons from GS to CGS, 24 providing more electrons for CO 2 to produce C 2 H 4 (Figure 3a).The surface potential of CGS (position B) decreased more (10.3mV-Ultra-thin CGS/GS versus 6.6 mV-CGS/GS), indicating that the thin layer structure containing S vacancy can provide more electrons and realize the high concentration of photogenerated electrons on the surface (Figure 3a,c). 25The excess surviving electrons were not only necessary for the photoconversion of CO 2 , but also promoted the adsorption and activation of CO 2 on the surface of the photocatalyst. 7DFT calculations further revealed the regulation of electron structure by S vacancy and the charge transfer at the interface.The calculated charge density difference between CGS and GS (Figure 3g) further confirmed that the existence of the S vacancy in the Ultrathin CGS/GS leaded to charge enrichment on Cu and Ga atoms near the S vacancy.To explore the reason for the high photocatalytic activity on Ultra-thin CGS/GS, the bonding type of ions surrounding to S vacancy was investigated using ELF.The calculated electron localization function plot (Figure 3e) showed that S vacancy induced a highly delocalized electron distribution in the original region of S atoms, which led to the local metallization between Cu and Ga adjacent to S vacancy to form a Cu-Ga metallic bond. 23c23c The Bard charge results (Figure 3f) also showed that the Cu and Ga around the S vacancy enriched electrons.Therefore, Cu-Ga is expected to be used as coupling dual sites to stabilize CHOCO and CHOHCO intermediates, and possibly reduce the energy barrier formed by C 2 H 4 . Since the catalytic behaviors of CO 2 reduction on Cu could be significantly affected by the states of Cu, the stabilized valence state of Cu during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction on Ultra-thin CGS/GS was first determined.The introduced S vacancies led to a rearrangement of the charge distribution in the crystal structure, which affected the copper ions.The various Cu and Cu 2 ratios were studied to explore their roles in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.The Cu /Cu 2 ratio in CGS/GS was 0.5, and the Cu /Cu 2 ratio in Ultra-thin CGS/GS increased to 1.With the increase of Cu ratio, the ethylene yield increased from 176.49 to 335.67 mol g -1 h -1 (Figure 3g).Therefore, the increase of Cu significantly promoted the thermodynamics of CO dimerization, and significantly improved the yield and selectivity of C 2 products (from 92.15 to 93.87).With the Cu / Cu 2 ratio increasing to 2, the yield of ethylene was decreased to 7.83 mol g -1 h -1 (C 1 /C 2 ratio increased from 0.21 to 15.39), because insufficient Cu 2 led to a decrease in the adsorption capacity of intermediate CO. 26In summary, it can be inferred that Cu on the catalyst surface can significantly promote the thermodynamics of CO dimerization, thus leading to significantly improved C 2 product selectivity, and Cu 2 can significantly strengthen the adsorption of CO intermediates, facilitating its further hydrogenation to produce C 2 H 4 . Theoretical calculation and in situ detection technologies were hired to analyze reaction pathway and energy barriers of CO 2 photocatalytic reduction reaction, which were the crucial means and basis for the analysis of multi proton-electron process for the formation of C 2 H 4 in current work.The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction on the surface of Ultra-thin CGS/ GS was monitored via in-situ Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) measurements.It was logical that the peak at 1447 cm -1 was determined to the vibrations of CH 2 CH 2 , 27 indicating the formation of C 2 H 4 as a final production, which was consistence with the result of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction (Figure 4a).Critically, the band at 1314 cm -1 was assigned to the stretching vibration of the OCCHOH intermediate, 7 verifying the OCCHOH was a key intermediate for the coupling of CC bond in the process of photocatalytic reduction on the surface of Ultra-thin CGS/GS, which was demonstrated by Gibbs free energy calculation.The bands located at 1507, 1546, and 1724 cm -1 in the spectra were assigned to the carboxyl intermediate of COOH, 28 and the band located at 2086 cm -1 was assigned to chemisorbed CO (namely CO), respectively. 29he mechanism of photocatalytic selectivity on Ultra-thin CGS/ GS was studied by DFT simulation systematically.The CO 2 and H 2 O molecules were initially adsorbed on the surface of CGS-Vs (Figure 4b,c).The free energy variations of CO activation for photocatalytic CO 2 to CO process on Ultra-thin CGS/ GS surface were calculated to illustrate the pathway (Figure 4d).The limited step of CO production, which turned to be the intermediate of C 2 H 4 generation, was hydrogenation of CO 2 to form COOH intermediate (Free energy: 0.96 eV).Subsequently, the reaction intermediate (COOH) further coupled the proton/electron pair to form CO molecules.Adsorption of CO can be further protonated to form a series of key reaction intermediates with unsaturated coordination in turn, as confirmed by in-situ FTIR measurements (Figure 4a). The mechanism of CC coupling was influenced by the various surface properties of the catalyst intrinsically, and it was also needed to be illustrated urgently for the C 2 H 4 evolution mechanism.The evolution of C 2 H 4 free energy diagrams was summarized and showed that the formation of CO to CHO was considered as a potential determining step (1.35 eV) for the subsequent C-C coupling process (Figure 4g).Herein, the different C-C coupling energy barriers of two unsaturated reaction intermediates (CHO and CHOH) were evaluated (Figure 4e).The free energy of CHOCO formation was 0.12 eV, which was lower than other coupling pathways (CHOHCO was 0.17 eV), however, the coupling energy barrier value (Figure 4f) of CHOHCO (-0.25 eV) was lower than that of CHOCO (0.30 eV), hence the coupling and hydrogenation of CHOHCO can generate C 2 H 4 .The upshift of the d-band center (Figure S18, Supporting Information) of CuGa ions induced by S vacancy can not only enforce the adsorption ability for the intermediates of CHOHCO to initiate CC coupling, but also accumulate electrons to drive the kinetic process of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.In other words, the coupling of CO with CHOH to generate CHOHCO was the most thermodynamically dominant pathway to form the CC bond.Carefully analyzing the molecular structure of the OCCHOH intermediate shows that the CC distance is 1.34 A, and the C-C site is 110-120, so the ideal distance between two active sites for forming the OCCHOH species was 2.6 A.Therefore, the introduction of sulfur vacancies at an appropriate distance around the active site can significantly increase the catalytic activity and C 2 H 4 selectivity."}, {"llm generation": "Batch", "source": "Gas phase photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was carried out in a Pyrex glass reaction cell connected to a glassclosed gas circulation and evacuation system (Shanghai Boyi Scientific Instrument Co. Ltd., China).", "context": "In conclusion, to enhance the photogeneration efficiency of C 2 H 4 on the Ultra-thin CGS/GS surface, the chemical states of photocatalyst were adjusted successfully via a simple hydrothermal method.The Ultra-thin structure enabled more carriers to move from the interior to the surface and surviving accumulate onto the active site, thus improving the photocatalytic activity.Most importantly, the presence of S vacancy regulated the mechanism of multi proton electron pathway of CO 2 photoreduction process.S vacancy induced a highly delocalized electron distribution, which led to the local metallization between Cu and Ga near the S vacancy to form the Cu-Ga metallic bond as coupling double sites, allowing C 2 H 4 to be the dominant product.This work paves a new way for adjusting the geometric distance of the active sites via the vacancy engineering, which significantly boosted the efficiency of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.CuGaS 2 was prepared by the hydrothermal method.0.025 g Cu 2 O prepared above and 0.0308 g GaCl 3 were added into 40 mL deionized water.After stirring for 15 min, 0.0424 mg of l-cysteine was added into the above suspension followed by stirring for another 15 min.The suspension was transferred to a 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave, and then the autoclave was sealed and maintained at 140 C for 12 h.Finally, the obtained product was washed with deionized water and alcohol for three times each and dried at 60 C for 12 h in a vacuum.Samples were named CGS.

Photocatalytic Measurement: Gas phase photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was carried out in a Pyrex glass reaction cell connected to a glassclosed gas circulation and evacuation system (Shanghai Boyi Scientific Instrument Co. Ltd., China).In the CO 2 photocatalytic process, 20 mg sample was dispersed in quartz paper, and 3 mL deionized water was added into the glass reactor.Triethanolamine (TEOA) was also added into the glass reactor.The instrument was initially vacuum-treated many times to remove residual gases and then pumped with high-purity CO 2 to 70 kPa pressure.A 300 W Xe lamp with a 420 nm cutoff filter ( 420 nm) was used as a light irradiation source.The temperature of the reaction cell was controlled at 283 0.2 K through the recirculating cooling water system during the photocatalytic process.During light irradiation, the gas products (C 2 H 4 , CH 4 , CO) were qualitatively analyzed by an online gas chromatograph (GC-2014C, Shimadzu), and other gas products (H 2 ) were analyzed by an online gas chromatograph (GC-2014C, Shimadzu) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector.0.5 mL productions were taken for testing once an hour.The selectivity of formed productions was deduced according to the following equation: Computational Methods: All calculations were carried out using the density functional theory (DFT) within the generalized-gradient approximation (GGA) with the exchange-correlation functional of Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE).This was implemented in the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP), which spanned reciprocal space with a plane-wave basis and used the projector-augmented wave (PAW) method. For the calculation of DOS of CuGaS 2 and Ga 2 S 3 , 16-atom primitive cell and 20-atom primitive cell were used.The cutoff energy was 500 eV and the Monkhorst-Pack k-point mesh were 4 4 2 and 2 2 3, respectively.The residual forces on atoms were below 0.01 eV A -1 .
