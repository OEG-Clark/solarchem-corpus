efficient photocatalytic CO 2 conversion to high value-added carbon products."}, {"llm generation": "P/Cu SAsCN", "source": "Figure 1g displayed the XANES spectra of P/Cu SAsCN photocatalyst, with Cu foil, CuO and Cu 2 O as references.", "context": "The PA N and CuA N 4 dual active moieties incorporated in graphitic carbon nitride were prepared following the process described in the Supporting Information.Figure 1a and Figure S1 demonstrate 2D nanosheets structure of CN matrix and no Cu nanoparticles or cluster can be detected.To investigate the distribution of Cu atoms, the aberrationcorrected high-angle-annular-dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (AC HAADF-STEM) was performed.Individual Cu atoms could be observed as bright spots (Figure 1b, red circles, and Figure S2), suggested the isolated distribution of Cu atoms in the matrix.The corresponding energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping images of P/Cu SAsCN confirmed the uniform distributions of Cu and P on the entire CN matrix (Figure 1c).The reference samples, P incorporated CN (PCN) and Cu SAsCN displayed similar morphologies with bulk CN, and no obvious nanoparticles could be observed (Figure S3-S7).Furthermore, the powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and Raman spectra were also employed to characterize the as-synthesized samples, which indicated that the P/Cu SAsCN maintained the characteristics of CN structure (Table S1 andFigure Synchrotron radiation soft X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy measurement was employed to investigate the atomic coordination structure of C and N atoms in P/Cu SAsCN.As shown in Figure 1d, the peak at 288.5 eV (orange square frame) could be ascribed to the (CA NA Cu) anti-bonding orbital in C K-edge spectra.As for the N Kedge spectrum of P/Cu SAsCN (Figure 1e), the peaks d (d 1 , d 2) and e originate from the nitrogen in the pyridinic and pyrrolic rings, respectively and the peak f originates from graphitic nitrogen.The results revealed that the proportion of pyridinic N (peak d 2 , blue square frame in Figure 1e) slightly increased in P/Cu SAsCN, which possibly due to the formation of PA N coordination structure.As for the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results of P 2p in P/Cu SAsCN (Figure 1f), the 133.5 and 134.4 eV peaks could be attributed to the characteristic binding energies of the PN and PA N coordination respectively, 8 suggested that P atoms could replace the C sites in the CN framework, which was similar with that of PCN (Figure S13).Hard X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) at Cu K-edge were further carried out to accurately confirm the atomically dispersed and local coordination environment of Cu atoms in P/Cu SAsCN.Figure 1g displayed the XANES spectra of P/Cu SAsCN photocatalyst, with Cu foil, CuO and Cu 2 O as references.The absorption threshold for the P/Cu SAsCN was situated between Cu 2 O and CuO, showing that Cu had a partial positive charge and its valence state was between 1 and 2 valence, agreeing well with the XPS analysis of Cu and N species in P/Cu SAsCN (Figure S14-S17 and Table S2).Figure 1h exhibited the samples' Fourier transform (FT) curve of extended X-ray absorption fine structure (FT-EXAFS).The Cu foil possesses a central peak at 2.2 A attributed to the CuA Cu metal interaction.Only one main peak at 1.5 A could be observed in P/Cu SAsCN, indicating the foramtion of CuA N bond and no signal peak of CuA Cu coordination.The wavelet transform (WT) further proved the atomic dispersion of Cu in P/Cu SAsCN (Figure S18).The WT contour plots of P/Cu SAsCN showed only one intensity maximum at about 3.8 A A 1 , which could be ascribed to the CuA N bonding.The fitting results (Figure 1i and Table S3) suggested that P/Cu SAsCN possessed a coordination number of four (CuA N 4 ) and the corresponding CuA N average bond length of 1.92 A.According to these results, the optimized atomic structure model of P/Cu SAsCN was proposed (Figure S19).In contrast, the XANES, EXAFS, WT and XPS of Cu SAsCN were also performed (Figure S20-S23 and Table S3), indicating the similar coordination structure with that of P/Cu SAsCN. UV/Vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were conducted to reveal the light harvesting ability of samples in Figure 2a.It can be found that P/Cu SAsCN showed a broad and strongest absorption in the region of 500-800 nm compared with that of other samples.According to the Tauc plots (using the Kubelka-Munk equation), the band gap (E g ) of samples could be calculated as 2.81, 2.78, 2.49, and 2.37 eV for CN, PCN, Cu SAsCN, and P/Cu SAsCN, respectively (Figure S24).To determine the band structures more accurately, Mott-Schottky (M-S) and XPS valance band spectra were involved in evaluating the conductor band minimum (CBM) and valence band maximum (VBM) potentials of samples (Figure S25,S26). The results demonstrated that the decoration of Cu and P atoms in the CN matrix could narrow the band gap of bulk CN, enhancing the light harvesting ability of P/Cu SAsCN (Figure 2b).Meanwhile, the suitable energy band levels of P/Cu SAsCN presented an opportunity for straddling the reaction potentials of CO 2 to CO, CH 4 and C 2 H 6 (Figure 2c). The activities of photocatalytic CO 2 RR performances of the samples were evaluated in a gas-circulation system with a closed quartz reactor under light irradiation.The results (Figure 2d and Figure S27) showed that CO and CH 4 were the main products in the presence of bulk CN and PCN photocatalysts after ten hours of irradiation, only a trace amount of C 2 H 6 could be detected.We further found that the photocatalytic CO 2 RR activity of CN could be dramatically improved after introducing dual sites (Cu and P atoms) into the CN matrix, with the evolution rates of 765.9 and 465.2 mol g A 1 h A 1 for CO and CH 4 , respectively (Figure S27).More strikingly, the P/Cu SAsCN exhibited an excellent evolution rate of the C 2 H 6 product (616.6mol g A 1 h A 1 ), which was 26 times higher than that of Cu SAsCN (23.7 mol g A 1 h A 1 ).The photocatalytic performances of samples indicated that the introduction of P atoms might have great contribution on the production of C 2 H 6 over P/Cu SAsCN.In addition, the light-driven CO 2 RR performance of P/Cu SAsCN was a top-level photocatalyst compared with the previously reports (Table S4).The control experiments without detectable C 2 H 6 product in the dark, no catalyst or in the argon atmosphere, suggested that the photocatalyst, light irradiation and input CO 2 were indispensable for the photocatalytic CO 2 RR to C 2 H 6 (Figure 2e).For the stability test, no significant decrease in productions rates could be observed during the recycling process (Figure 2f and Figure S28).Also, the P/Cu SAsCN sample could be well maintained after the stability test (Figure S29-S32).In addition, the apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of P/Cu SAsCN was calculated to be 12.55 at 350 nm (Figure S33 and Table S5), which is much higher than that of other samples.All these results suggested that the constructed dual sites significantly enhanced photocatalytic CO 2 RR to hydrocarbon fuels, especially for C 2 H 6 . Dynamics studies of photo-generated carriers were carried out to explain why dual sites displayed excellent photocatalytic CO 2 RR performance.In Figure 3a, P/Cu SAsCN exhibited significantly enhanced photocurrent compared with that of Cu SAsCN.This could be attributed to the more efficient electron-hole pair separation and transfer after the introduction of P single atoms in the Cu SAsCN matrix.Simultaneously, the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of samples (Figure 3b) also demon-strated a smaller semicircle in Nyquist plots of P/Cu SAsCN compared to Cu SAsCN, suggesting easier migration and transmission of photo-generated carriers.Furthermore, time resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra were recorded to quantify the charge-carrier dynamic of the samples (Figure 3c).As depicted in Table S6, the average lifetime ( ave ) of CN, PCN, Cu SAsCN, and P/Cu SAsCN was calculated to be 2.47, 2.56, 2.84, and 7.13 ns, respectively.The lifetime of photo-induced carriers over P/ Cu SAsCN was remarkable longer than that of Cu SAsCN, which was beneficial for photocatalytic performance.In addition, the more efficient photoluminescence (PL) quenching of P/Cu SAsCN further indicated the efficient retarded the electron-hole recombination (Figure S34).The above results indicated that dual sites of P and Cu atoms might play an important roles in the enhancement of charge migration and transfer ability of P/Cu SAsCN under light irradiation.Quasi-in situ XPS instrument and in situ low-temperature electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurement were carried out to find experimental evidence for the contribution of P and Cu atoms on the photo-induced carriers' separation over P/Cu SAsCN photocatalyst. As for the quasi-in situ XPS measurement, a positive shift of P 2p could be observed after light irradiation upon P/Cu SAsCN, which indicated the increases in the valance of P after light irradiation (Figure 3d).This result demonstrated the hole capture roles of P atoms in P/Cu SAsCN during photocatalytic process.The P single atoms could trap the photo-generated holes, which was beneficial for the ) Schematic band structures of CN, PCN, Cu SAsCN, and P/Cu SAsCN.c) Schematic energy band levels of P/Cu SAsCN compared with the redox potentials of CO 2 to CO, CH 4 , and C 2 H 6 .d) Photocatalytic CO 2 RR production of C 2 H 6 over CN, PCN, Cu SAsCN, and P/Cu SAsCN.e) Time-dependent photocatalytic activity over P/Cu SAsCN for the production of C 2 H 6 and the control experiments under different conditions.f) Cyclic stability of C 2 H 6 production over P/Cu SAsCN. accumulation of photo-generated electrons on Cu sites to achieve multi-electron transfer process of CO 2 RR.Meanwhile, a negative shift of Cu 2p 3/2 binding energy occurred after light irradiation, which suggested the electron capture roles of Cu atoms in P/Cu SAsCN photocatalyst (Figure 3e).We further employed the in situ low-temperature electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) instrument to prove that the photo-generated electrons accumulated on Cu SAs sites over P/Cu SAsCN under light irradiation (Figure 3f and Figure S35).Taken together, the results of photogenerated carriers' dynamics studies well explain the remarkably higher separation efficiency of photo-generated carriers.Moreover, the holes' capture capability of P atoms in P/Cu SAsCN could enhance the accumulation of electrons on Cu SAs sites, and thus facilitate the multielectron transfer process on charge-enriched Cu sites during the photocatalytic CO 2 RR.The defect signals of samples in Figure S36 revealed that PA N and CuA N 4 dual sites had the dominant contribution for promoting carrier separation efficiency of P/Cu SAsCN. To investigate the carbon source of photocatalytic CO 2 RR upon P/Cu SAsCN, the 13 CO 2 isotope labeling experiment was carried out.As shown in Figure 4a, the signals with m/z values of 17, 29 and 32 assigned to 13 CH 4 , 13 CO and 13 C 2 H 6 are detected when 13 CO 2 is used as feedstock for photocatalytic CO 2 RR.Combined with the control experiments (Figure 4b) and the gas chromatograms (Figure S37, S38), we comfirmed that the generated CO and hydrocarbons on P/Cu SAsCN were definitely derived from the reduction of CO 2 rather than other sources.In situ FTIR measurement was further performed to detect the reaction intermediates, revealing the detailed reaction mechanism during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.To exclude the interferences of gaseous water, sacrificial agent (TEOA) and photocatalyst, the control experiments of in situ FTIR measurement have been conducted (Figure 4c, d and Figure S39, S40, see details in the Supporting Information).As shown in Figure 4e, the characteristic FTIR bands of CO (CO) can be observed (1944 and 2076 cm A 1 for CO; 2155 cm A 1 for CO gas), 4n, 9a,b which is the prerequisite for the further reduction of CO into CH 4 and C 2 H 6 .The CHO and CH 3 intermediates (1166 and 1454 cm A 1 ) can be detected, which are crucial for CO 2 RR to CH 4 . 9b,c9b,c OCA COH is one of the key intermediates to obtain C 2 products in CO 2 RR, which originates from the hydrogenation of OCA CO intermediates.The co-existence bands of 1584 cm A 1 and 1166 cm A 1 can be considered as the spectroscopic identification of OCA COH intermediates adsorbed on P/Cu SAsCN, which provides strong experimental evidence for CA C coupling during the photocatalytic CO 2 RR. 6c, 9d6c, 9d Compared with the in situ FTIR measurement with 12 CO 2 as feedstock, all the detected reaction intermediates shift evidently when using 13 CO 2 as feedstock (Fig- ure 4f). To further understand the specific structure, electronic properties and CO 2 RR mechanism of the constructed dual sites photocatalyst, we performed systematic DFT calculations.At first, we evaluated the stability parameters of P and Cu incorporated CN with different configurations by comparing the calculated total energies.Six different carbons (C1 to C6) are available on the surface of CN for P substitution (i.e., PCN), where C1 and C6 substitution with comparable total energies are the most stable (Figure S41).Further doping PCN with Cu has three different configurations (Figure S42), and the one with four CuA N bonds (d CuA N 2.02 A) is the most stable structure.Besides, the single Cu doped CN and other possible P/Cu SAsCN configurations were also given (Figure S43, 44).Indeed, the theoretically identified most stable P/Cu SAsCN structure matches very well with experimentally detected information, i.e., four coordinated Cu single atom.Therefore, we further investigated the electronic properties and CO 2 RR reaction mechanisms of P/Cu SAsCN catalyst to understand its intrinsic advantage. As shown in Figure 5a and 5b, the total density of states (TDOS) of CN and P/Cu SAsCN catalysts calculated by hybrid functional (HSE06) show obvious differences.Specifically, the band gap is narrowed from 3.15 eV (CN) to 2.34 eV (P/Cu SAsCN) after introducing of P and Cu atoms, and an obviously empty mid-gap state is observed below the conduction band, which corresponds to the tail absorption in the visible-light region (Figure 2a).Remarkably, the calculated band gap of P/Cu SAsCN (2.34 eV in Figure 5b) is in good agreement with the experimental spectrum data (2.37 eV in Figure 2b), which further validates the reliability of our theoretically identified model.The P-LDOS of P/Cu SAsCN demonstrates that the VBM has the contribution from P 2p, indicating the hole capture roles of P dopant.Moreover, the CBM of P/Cu SAsCN has been confirmed as A 0.78 V (vs.NHE) in the experimental part (Figure 2c), which is much higher than the reduction potential of CO 2 /C 2 H 6 A 0.27 V (vs.NHE).Thus, these unique dual sites features induced by doping make P/Cu SAsCN photocatalyst an ideal candidate for light-driven CO 2 reduction. To evaluate the rationality of our theoretical prediction, we further examined the reaction mechanism of CO 2 reduction to C 2 products on P/Cu SAsCN photocatalyst.Based on the in situ FTIR results, both CO and OCA COH (hydrogenation of OCA CO) intermediates have been detected during the photocatalytic CO 2 RR.We started our simulations of CO 2 RR from CO and focused on the formation of OCA CO and OCA COH intermediates.The low kinetic energy barrier of CO coupling on Cu sites (Figure 5c) and the difference charge density between OCA CO and Cu sites (Figure 5d) proved the formation of a stable CA C bond, paving a reasonable basis for further hydrogenation. 10Owing to the efficient carrier separation capability of dual sites catalyst, the charge-enriched Cu sites can be formed under light irradiation, which is more active for CO 2 reduction.The two-electron reduction of CO 2 to CO could be first triggered on the charge-enriched Cu sites.The FTIR bands of CO and CO(g) were observed in the region of 1900-2100 cm A 1 and became obvious under the subsequent illuminations in accordance with the high evolution rate of CO in our experimental results.Part of CO desorbed from Cu sites generate CO (g) (9': CH 3 CH 2 OH)!10: CH 3 CH 2 !CH 3 CH 3 (g) (Figure 5e).The hydrogenation of OCCO to OCA COH species with the largest uphill free energy change of 0.45 eV is the potential-determining step to ensure the formation of C 2 H 6 final products.Theoretically, only an energy input of 0.45 eV is needed to drive this reduction process, indicating the high photocatalytic activity of P/Cu SAsCN for CO 2 RR to C 2 H 6 (Figure 5e).Therefore, the reaction mechanism of photocatalytic CO 2 RR to C 2 H 6 has been deeply studied by the combination of in situ spectroscopic experiments and theoretical simulations."}, {"llm generation": "P/Cu SAsCN", "source": "The dynamics studies of charge carriers proved that the excellent charge separation ability of the P/Cu SAsCN photocatalyst could attribute to the electron and hole capture sites of Cu and P dual sites respectively in CN matrix, which promoted the formation of charge-enrich Cu sites to achieve multielectron transfer process of CO 2 RR.", "context": "In summary, we demonstrated that the conversion of CO 2 to multi-carbon products could be effectively achieved by constructing dual sites structure in CN network.The dynamics studies of charge carriers proved that the excellent charge separation ability of the P/Cu SAsCN photocatalyst could attribute to the electron and hole capture sites of Cu and P dual sites respectively in CN matrix, which promoted the formation of charge-enrich Cu sites to achieve multielectron transfer process of CO 2 RR.Mechanistic study with DFT calculations identifies a moderate energy barrier for CA C coupling and confirms the favorable production of C 2 H 6 on the P/Cu SAsCN photocatalyst.Noteworthy, the theoretically identified key reaction intermediates (OCA COH) in the potential-limiting step were experimentally detected by in situ FTIR spectra.This work not only provides an efficient CO 2 RR catalyst to high grade hydrocarbon fuel, but also opens new opportunities for designing and optimizing photocatalysts with atomic precision.

UV/Vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were conducted to reveal the light harvesting ability of samples in Figure 2a.It can be found that P/Cu SAsCN showed a broad and strongest absorption in the region of 500-800 nm compared with that of other samples.According to the Tauc plots (using the Kubelka-Munk equation), the band gap (E g ) of samples could be calculated as 2.81, 2.78, 2.49, and 2.37 eV for CN, PCN, Cu SAsCN, and P/Cu SAsCN, respectively (Figure S24).To determine the band structures more accurately, Mott-Schottky (M-S) and XPS valance band spectra were involved in evaluating the conductor band minimum (CBM) and valence band maximum (VBM) potentials of samples (Figure S25,S26). The results demonstrated that the decoration of Cu and P atoms in the CN matrix could narrow the band gap of bulk CN, enhancing the light harvesting ability of P/Cu SAsCN (Figure 2b).Meanwhile, the suitable energy band levels of P/Cu SAsCN presented an opportunity for straddling the reaction potentials of CO 2 to CO, CH 4 and C 2 H 6 (Figure 2c). The activities of photocatalytic CO 2 RR performances of the samples were evaluated in a gas-circulation system with a closed quartz reactor under light irradiation.The results (Figure 2d and Figure S27) showed that CO and CH 4 were the main products in the presence of bulk CN and PCN photocatalysts after ten hours of irradiation, only a trace amount of C 2 H 6 could be detected.We further found that the photocatalytic CO 2 RR activity of CN could be dramatically improved after introducing dual sites (Cu and P atoms) into the CN matrix, with the evolution rates of 765.9 and 465.2 mol g A 1 h A 1 for CO and CH 4 , respectively (Figure S27).More strikingly, the P/Cu SAsCN exhibited an excellent evolution rate of the C 2 H 6 product (616.6mol g A 1 h A 1 ), which was 26 times higher than that of Cu SAsCN (23.7 mol g A 1 h A 1 ).The photocatalytic performances of samples indicated that the introduction of P atoms might have great contribution on the production of C 2 H 6 over P/Cu SAsCN.In addition, the light-driven CO 2 RR performance of P/Cu SAsCN was a top-level photocatalyst compared with the previously reports (Table S4).The control experiments without detectable C 2 H 6 product in the dark, no catalyst or in the argon atmosphere, suggested that the photocatalyst, light irradiation and input CO 2 were indispensable for the photocatalytic CO 2 RR to C 2 H 6 (Figure 2e).For the stability test, no significant decrease in productions rates could be observed during the recycling process (Figure 2f and Figure S28).Also, the P/Cu SAsCN sample could be well maintained after the stability test (Figure S29-S32).In addition, the apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of P/Cu SAsCN was calculated to be 12.55 at 350 nm (Figure S33 and Table S5), which is much higher than that of other samples.All these results suggested that the constructed dual sites significantly enhanced photocatalytic CO 2 RR to hydrocarbon fuels, especially for C 2 H 6 . Dynamics studies of photo-generated carriers were carried out to explain why dual sites displayed excellent photocatalytic CO 2 RR performance.In Figure 3a, P/Cu SAsCN exhibited significantly enhanced photocurrent compared with that of Cu SAsCN.This could be attributed to the more efficient electron-hole pair separation and transfer after the introduction of P single atoms in the Cu SAsCN matrix.Simultaneously, the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of samples (Figure 3b) also demon-strated a smaller semicircle in Nyquist plots of P/Cu SAsCN compared to Cu SAsCN, suggesting easier migration and transmission of photo-generated carriers.Furthermore, time resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra were recorded to quantify the charge-carrier dynamic of the samples (Figure 3c).As depicted in Table S6, the average lifetime ( ave ) of CN, PCN, Cu SAsCN, and P/Cu SAsCN was calculated to be 2.47, 2.56, 2.84, and 7.13 ns, respectively.The lifetime of photo-induced carriers over P/ Cu SAsCN was remarkable longer than that of Cu SAsCN, which was beneficial for photocatalytic performance.In addition, the more efficient photoluminescence (PL) quenching of P/Cu SAsCN further indicated the efficient retarded the electron-hole recombination (Figure S34).The above results indicated that dual sites of P and Cu atoms might play an important roles in the enhancement of charge migration and transfer ability of P/Cu SAsCN under light irradiation.Quasi-in situ XPS instrument and in situ low-temperature electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurement were carried out to find experimental evidence for the contribution of P and Cu atoms on the photo-induced carriers' separation over P/Cu SAsCN photocatalyst. As for the quasi-in situ XPS measurement, a positive shift of P 2p could be observed after light irradiation upon P/Cu SAsCN, which indicated the increases in the valance of P after light irradiation (Figure 3d).This result demonstrated the hole capture roles of P atoms in P/Cu SAsCN during photocatalytic process.The P single atoms could trap the photo-generated holes, which was beneficial for the ) Schematic band structures of CN, PCN, Cu SAsCN, and P/Cu SAsCN.c) Schematic energy band levels of P/Cu SAsCN compared with the redox potentials of CO 2 to CO, CH 4 , and C 2 H 6 .d) Photocatalytic CO 2 RR production of C 2 H 6 over CN, PCN, Cu SAsCN, and P/Cu SAsCN.e) Time-dependent photocatalytic activity over P/Cu SAsCN for the production of C 2 H 6 and the control experiments under different conditions.f) Cyclic stability of C 2 H 6 production over P/Cu SAsCN. accumulation of photo-generated electrons on Cu sites to achieve multi-electron transfer process of CO 2 RR.Meanwhile, a negative shift of Cu 2p 3/2 binding energy occurred after light irradiation, which suggested the electron capture roles of Cu atoms in P/Cu SAsCN photocatalyst (Figure 3e).We further employed the in situ low-temperature electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) instrument to prove that the photo-generated electrons accumulated on Cu SAs sites over P/Cu SAsCN under light irradiation (Figure 3f and Figure S35).Taken together, the results of photogenerated carriers' dynamics studies well explain the remarkably higher separation efficiency of photo-generated carriers.Moreover, the holes' capture capability of P atoms in P/Cu SAsCN could enhance the accumulation of electrons on Cu SAs sites, and thus facilitate the multielectron transfer process on charge-enriched Cu sites during the photocatalytic CO 2 RR.The defect signals of samples in Figure S36 revealed that PA N and CuA N 4 dual sites had the dominant contribution for promoting carrier separation efficiency of P/Cu SAsCN. To investigate the carbon source of photocatalytic CO 2 RR upon P/Cu SAsCN, the 13 CO 2 isotope labeling experiment was carried out.As shown in Figure 4a, the signals with m/z values of 17, 29 and 32 assigned to 13 CH 4 , 13 CO and 13 C 2 H 6 are detected when 13 CO 2 is used as feedstock for photocatalytic CO 2 RR.Combined with the control experiments (Figure 4b) and the gas chromatograms (Figure S37, S38), we comfirmed that the generated CO and hydrocarbons on P/Cu SAsCN were definitely derived from the reduction of CO 2 rather than other sources.In situ FTIR measurement was further performed to detect the reaction intermediates, revealing the detailed reaction mechanism during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.To exclude the interferences of gaseous water, sacrificial agent (TEOA) and photocatalyst, the control experiments of in situ FTIR measurement have been conducted (Figure 4c, d and Figure S39, S40, see details in the Supporting Information).As shown in Figure 4e, the characteristic FTIR bands of CO (CO) can be observed (1944 and 2076 cm A 1 for CO; 2155 cm A 1 for CO gas), 4n, 9a,b which is the prerequisite for the further reduction of CO into CH 4 and C 2 H 6 .The CHO and CH 3 intermediates (1166 and 1454 cm A 1 ) can be detected, which are crucial for CO 2 RR to CH 4 . 9b,c9b,c OCA COH is one of the key intermediates to obtain C 2 products in CO 2 RR, which originates from the hydrogenation of OCA CO intermediates.The co-existence bands of 1584 cm A 1 and 1166 cm A 1 can be considered as the spectroscopic identification of OCA COH intermediates adsorbed on P/Cu SAsCN, which provides strong experimental evidence for CA C coupling during the photocatalytic CO 2 RR. 6c, 9d6c, 9d Compared with the in situ FTIR measurement with 12 CO 2 as feedstock, all the detected reaction intermediates shift evidently when using 13 CO 2 as feedstock (Fig- ure 4f). To further understand the specific structure, electronic properties and CO 2 RR mechanism of the constructed dual sites photocatalyst, we performed systematic DFT calculations.At first, we evaluated the stability parameters of P and Cu incorporated CN with different configurations by comparing the calculated total energies.Six different carbons (C1 to C6) are available on the surface of CN for P substitution (i.e., PCN), where C1 and C6 substitution with comparable total energies are the most stable (Figure S41).Further doping PCN with Cu has three different configurations (Figure S42), and the one with four CuA N bonds (d CuA N 2.02 A) is the most stable structure.Besides, the single Cu doped CN and other possible P/Cu SAsCN configurations were also given (Figure S43, 44).Indeed, the theoretically identified most stable P/Cu SAsCN structure matches very well with experimentally detected information, i.e., four coordinated Cu single atom.Therefore, we further investigated the electronic properties and CO 2 RR reaction mechanisms of P/Cu SAsCN catalyst to understand its intrinsic advantage. As shown in Figure 5a and 5b, the total density of states (TDOS) of CN and P/Cu SAsCN catalysts calculated by hybrid functional (HSE06) show obvious differences.Specifically, the band gap is narrowed from 3.15 eV (CN) to 2.34 eV (P/Cu SAsCN) after introducing of P and Cu atoms, and an obviously empty mid-gap state is observed below the conduction band, which corresponds to the tail absorption in the visible-light region (Figure 2a).Remarkably, the calculated band gap of P/Cu SAsCN (2.34 eV in Figure 5b) is in good agreement with the experimental spectrum data (2.37 eV in Figure 2b), which further validates the reliability of our theoretically identified model.The P-LDOS of P/Cu SAsCN demonstrates that the VBM has the contribution from P 2p, indicating the hole capture roles of P dopant.Moreover, the CBM of P/Cu SAsCN has been confirmed as A 0.78 V (vs.NHE) in the experimental part (Figure 2c), which is much higher than the reduction potential of CO 2 /C 2 H 6 A 0.27 V (vs.NHE).Thus, these unique dual sites features induced by doping make P/Cu SAsCN photocatalyst an ideal candidate for light-driven CO 2 reduction. To evaluate the rationality of our theoretical prediction, we further examined the reaction mechanism of CO 2 reduction to C 2 products on P/Cu SAsCN photocatalyst.Based on the in situ FTIR results, both CO and OCA COH (hydrogenation of OCA CO) intermediates have been detected during the photocatalytic CO 2 RR.We started our simulations of CO 2 RR from CO and focused on the formation of OCA CO and OCA COH intermediates.The low kinetic energy barrier of CO coupling on Cu sites (Figure 5c) and the difference charge density between OCA CO and Cu sites (Figure 5d) proved the formation of a stable CA C bond, paving a reasonable basis for further hydrogenation. 10Owing to the efficient carrier separation capability of dual sites catalyst, the charge-enriched Cu sites can be formed under light irradiation, which is more active for CO 2 reduction.The two-electron reduction of CO 2 to CO could be first triggered on the charge-enriched Cu sites.The FTIR bands of CO and CO(g) were observed in the region of 1900-2100 cm A 1 and became obvious under the subsequent illuminations in accordance with the high evolution rate of CO in our experimental results.Part of CO desorbed from Cu sites generate CO (g) (9': CH 3 CH 2 OH)!10: CH 3 CH 2 !CH 3 CH 3 (g) (Figure 5e).The hydrogenation of OCCO to OCA COH species with the largest uphill free energy change of 0.45 eV is the potential-determining step to ensure the formation of C 2 H 6 final products.Theoretically, only an energy input of 0.45 eV is needed to drive this reduction process, indicating the high photocatalytic activity of P/Cu SAsCN for CO 2 RR to C 2 H 6 (Figure 5e).Therefore, the reaction mechanism of photocatalytic CO 2 RR to C 2 H 6 has been deeply studied by the combination of in situ spectroscopic experiments and theoretical simulations."}, {"llm generation": "UV", "source": "TRPL analysis and fitting results ( ex 320 nm).", "context": "In summary, we demonstrated that the conversion of CO 2 to multi-carbon products could be effectively achieved by constructing dual sites structure in CN network.The dynamics studies of charge carriers proved that the excellent charge separation ability of the P/Cu SAsCN photocatalyst could attribute to the electron and hole capture sites of Cu and P dual sites respectively in CN matrix, which promoted the formation of charge-enrich Cu sites to achieve multielectron transfer process of CO 2 RR.Mechanistic study with DFT calculations identifies a moderate energy barrier for CA C coupling and confirms the favorable production of C 2 H 6 on the P/Cu SAsCN photocatalyst.Noteworthy, the theoretically identified key reaction intermediates (OCA COH) in the potential-limiting step were experimentally detected by in situ FTIR spectra.This work not only provides an efficient CO 2 RR catalyst to high grade hydrocarbon fuel, but also opens new opportunities for designing and optimizing photocatalysts with atomic precision.

structure.As for the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results of P 2p in P/Cu SAsCN (Figure 1f), the 133.5 and 134.4 eV peaks could be attributed to the characteristic binding energies of the PN

The activities of photocatalytic CO 2 RR performances of the samples were evaluated in a gas-circulation system with a closed quartz reactor under light irradiation.The results (Figure 2d and Figure S27) showed that CO and CH 4 were the main products in the presence of bulk CN and PCN photocatalysts after ten hours of irradiation, only a trace amount of C 2 H 6 could be detected.We further found that the photocatalytic CO 2 RR activity of CN could be dramatically improved after introducing dual sites (Cu and P atoms) into the CN matrix, with the evolution rates of 765.9 and 465.2 mol g A 1 h A 1 for CO and CH 4 , respectively (Figure S27).More strikingly, the P/Cu SAsCN exhibited an excellent evolution rate of the C 2 H 6 product (616.6mol g A 1 h A 1 ), which was 26 times higher than that of Cu SAsCN (23.7 mol g A 1 h A 1 ).The photocatalytic performances of samples indicated that the introduction of P atoms might have great contribution on the production of C 2 H 6 over P/Cu SAsCN.In addition, the light-driven CO 2 RR performance of P/Cu SAsCN was a top-level photocatalyst compared with the previously reports (Table S4).The control experiments without detectable C 2 H 6 product in the dark, no catalyst or in the argon atmosphere, suggested that the photocatalyst, light irradiation and input CO 2 were indispensable for the photocatalytic CO 2 RR to C 2 H 6 (Figure 2e).For the stability test, no significant decrease in productions rates could be observed during the recycling process (Figure 2f and Figure S28).Also, the P/Cu SAsCN sample could be well maintained after the stability test (Figure S29-S32).In addition, the apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of P/Cu SAsCN was calculated to be 12.55 at 350 nm (Figure S33 and Table S5), which is much higher than that of other samples.All these results suggested that the constructed dual sites significantly enhanced photocatalytic CO 2 RR to hydrocarbon fuels, especially for C 2 H 6 . Dynamics studies of photo-generated carriers were carried out to explain why dual sites displayed excellent photocatalytic CO 2 RR performance.In Figure 3a, P/Cu SAsCN exhibited significantly enhanced photocurrent compared with that of Cu SAsCN.This could be attributed to the more efficient electron-hole pair separation and transfer after the introduction of P single atoms in the Cu SAsCN matrix.Simultaneously, the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of samples (Figure 3b) also demon-strated a smaller semicircle in Nyquist plots of P/Cu SAsCN compared to Cu SAsCN, suggesting easier migration and transmission of photo-generated carriers.Furthermore, time resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra were recorded to quantify the charge-carrier dynamic of the samples (Figure 3c).As depicted in Table S6, the average lifetime ( ave ) of CN, PCN, Cu SAsCN, and P/Cu SAsCN was calculated to be 2.47, 2.56, 2.84, and 7.13 ns, respectively.The lifetime of photo-induced carriers over P/ Cu SAsCN was remarkable longer than that of Cu SAsCN, which was beneficial for photocatalytic performance.In addition, the more efficient photoluminescence (PL) quenching of P/Cu SAsCN further indicated the efficient retarded the electron-hole recombination (Figure S34).The above results indicated that dual sites of P and Cu atoms might play an important roles in the enhancement of charge migration and transfer ability of P/Cu SAsCN under light irradiation.Quasi-in situ XPS instrument and in situ low-temperature electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurement were carried out to find experimental evidence for the contribution of P and Cu atoms on the photo-induced carriers' separation over P/Cu SAsCN photocatalyst. As for the quasi-in situ XPS measurement, a positive shift of P 2p could be observed after light irradiation upon P/Cu SAsCN, which indicated the increases in the valance of P after light irradiation (Figure 3d).This result demonstrated the hole capture roles of P atoms in P/Cu SAsCN during photocatalytic process.The P single atoms could trap the photo-generated holes, which was beneficial for the ) Schematic band structures of CN, PCN, Cu SAsCN, and P/Cu SAsCN.c) Schematic energy band levels of P/Cu SAsCN compared with the redox potentials of CO 2 to CO, CH 4 , and C 2 H 6 .d) Photocatalytic CO 2 RR production of C 2 H 6 over CN, PCN, Cu SAsCN, and P/Cu SAsCN.e) Time-dependent photocatalytic activity over P/Cu SAsCN for the production of C 2 H 6 and the control experiments under different conditions.f) Cyclic stability of C 2 H 6 production over P/Cu SAsCN. accumulation of photo-generated electrons on Cu sites to achieve multi-electron transfer process of CO 2 RR.Meanwhile, a negative shift of Cu 2p 3/2 binding energy occurred after light irradiation, which suggested the electron capture roles of Cu atoms in P/Cu SAsCN photocatalyst (Figure 3e).We further employed the in situ low-temperature electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) instrument to prove that the photo-generated electrons accumulated on Cu SAs sites over P/Cu SAsCN under light irradiation (Figure 3f and Figure S35).Taken together, the results of photogenerated carriers' dynamics studies well explain the remarkably higher separation efficiency of photo-generated carriers.Moreover, the holes' capture capability of P atoms in P/Cu SAsCN could enhance the accumulation of electrons on Cu SAs sites, and thus facilitate the multielectron transfer process on charge-enriched Cu sites during the photocatalytic CO 2 RR.The defect signals of samples in Figure S36 revealed that PA N and CuA N 4 dual sites had the dominant contribution for promoting carrier separation efficiency of P/Cu SAsCN. To investigate the carbon source of photocatalytic CO 2 RR upon P/Cu SAsCN, the 13 CO 2 isotope labeling experiment was carried out.As shown in Figure 4a, the signals with m/z values of 17, 29 and 32 assigned to 13 CH 4 , 13 CO and 13 C 2 H 6 are detected when 13 CO 2 is used as feedstock for photocatalytic CO 2 RR.Combined with the control experiments (Figure 4b) and the gas chromatograms (Figure S37, S38), we comfirmed that the generated CO and hydrocarbons on P/Cu SAsCN were definitely derived from the reduction of CO 2 rather than other sources.In situ FTIR measurement was further performed to detect the reaction intermediates, revealing the detailed reaction mechanism during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.To exclude the interferences of gaseous water, sacrificial agent (TEOA) and photocatalyst, the control experiments of in situ FTIR measurement have been conducted (Figure 4c, d and Figure S39, S40, see details in the Supporting Information).As shown in Figure 4e, the characteristic FTIR bands of CO (CO) can be observed (1944 and 2076 cm A 1 for CO; 2155 cm A 1 for CO gas), 4n, 9a,b which is the prerequisite for the further reduction of CO into CH 4 and C 2 H 6 .The CHO and CH 3 intermediates (1166 and 1454 cm A 1 ) can be detected, which are crucial for CO 2 RR to CH 4 . 9b,c9b,c OCA COH is one of the key intermediates to obtain C 2 products in CO 2 RR, which originates from the hydrogenation of OCA CO intermediates.The co-existence bands of 1584 cm A 1 and 1166 cm A 1 can be considered as the spectroscopic identification of OCA COH intermediates adsorbed on P/Cu SAsCN, which provides strong experimental evidence for CA C coupling during the photocatalytic CO 2 RR. 6c, 9d6c, 9d Compared with the in situ FTIR measurement with 12 CO 2 as feedstock, all the detected reaction intermediates shift evidently when using 13 CO 2 as feedstock (Fig- ure 4f). To further understand the specific structure, electronic properties and CO 2 RR mechanism of the constructed dual sites photocatalyst, we performed systematic DFT calculations.At first, we evaluated the stability parameters of P and Cu incorporated CN with different configurations by comparing the calculated total energies.Six different carbons (C1 to C6) are available on the surface of CN for P substitution (i.e., PCN), where C1 and C6 substitution with comparable total energies are the most stable (Figure S41).Further doping PCN with Cu has three different configurations (Figure S42), and the one with four CuA N bonds (d CuA N 2.02 A) is the most stable structure.Besides, the single Cu doped CN and other possible P/Cu SAsCN configurations were also given (Figure S43, 44).Indeed, the theoretically identified most stable P/Cu SAsCN structure matches very well with experimentally detected information, i.e., four coordinated Cu single atom.Therefore, we further investigated the electronic properties and CO 2 RR reaction mechanisms of P/Cu SAsCN catalyst to understand its intrinsic advantage. As shown in Figure 5a and 5b, the total density of states (TDOS) of CN and P/Cu SAsCN catalysts calculated by hybrid functional (HSE06) show obvious differences.Specifically, the band gap is narrowed from 3.15 eV (CN) to 2.34 eV (P/Cu SAsCN) after introducing of P and Cu atoms, and an obviously empty mid-gap state is observed below the conduction band, which corresponds to the tail absorption in the visible-light region (Figure 2a).Remarkably, the calculated band gap of P/Cu SAsCN (2.34 eV in Figure 5b) is in good agreement with the experimental spectrum data (2.37 eV in Figure 2b), which further validates the reliability of our theoretically identified model.The P-LDOS of P/Cu SAsCN demonstrates that the VBM has the contribution from P 2p, indicating the hole capture roles of P dopant.Moreover, the CBM of P/Cu SAsCN has been confirmed as A 0.78 V (vs.NHE) in the experimental part (Figure 2c), which is much higher than the reduction potential of CO 2 /C 2 H 6 A 0.27 V (vs.NHE).Thus, these unique dual sites features induced by doping make P/Cu SAsCN photocatalyst an ideal candidate for light-driven CO 2 reduction. To evaluate the rationality of our theoretical prediction, we further examined the reaction mechanism of CO 2 reduction to C 2 products on P/Cu SAsCN photocatalyst.Based on the in situ FTIR results, both CO and OCA COH (hydrogenation of OCA CO) intermediates have been detected during the photocatalytic CO 2 RR.We started our simulations of CO 2 RR from CO and focused on the formation of OCA CO and OCA COH intermediates.The low kinetic energy barrier of CO coupling on Cu sites (Figure 5c) and the difference charge density between OCA CO and Cu sites (Figure 5d) proved the formation of a stable CA C bond, paving a reasonable basis for further hydrogenation. 10Owing to the efficient carrier separation capability of dual sites catalyst, the charge-enriched Cu sites can be formed under light irradiation, which is more active for CO 2 reduction.The two-electron reduction of CO 2 to CO could be first triggered on the charge-enriched Cu sites.The FTIR bands of CO and CO(g) were observed in the region of 1900-2100 cm A 1 and became obvious under the subsequent illuminations in accordance with the high evolution rate of CO in our experimental results.Part of CO desorbed from Cu sites generate CO (g) (9': CH 3 CH 2 OH)!10: CH 3 CH 2 !CH 3 CH 3 (g) (Figure 5e).The hydrogenation of OCCO to OCA COH species with the largest uphill free energy change of 0.45 eV is the potential-determining step to ensure the formation of C 2 H 6 final products.Theoretically, only an energy input of 0.45 eV is needed to drive this reduction process, indicating the high photocatalytic activity of P/Cu SAsCN for CO 2 RR to C 2 H 6 (Figure 5e).Therefore, the reaction mechanism of photocatalytic CO 2 RR to C 2 H 6 has been deeply studied by the combination of in situ spectroscopic experiments and theoretical simulations."}, {"llm generation": "Gas", "source": "In situ FTIR measurement upon P/Cu SAsCN (Reaction condition: P/Cu SAsCN catalyst, H 2 O and Ar atmosphere).", "context": "In summary, we demonstrated that the conversion of CO 2 to multi-carbon products could be effectively achieved by constructing dual sites structure in CN network.The dynamics studies of charge carriers proved that the excellent charge separation ability of the P/Cu SAsCN photocatalyst could attribute to the electron and hole capture sites of Cu and P dual sites respectively in CN matrix, which promoted the formation of charge-enrich Cu sites to achieve multielectron transfer process of CO 2 RR.Mechanistic study with DFT calculations identifies a moderate energy barrier for CA C coupling and confirms the favorable production of C 2 H 6 on the P/Cu SAsCN photocatalyst.Noteworthy, the theoretically identified key reaction intermediates (OCA COH) in the potential-limiting step were experimentally detected by in situ FTIR spectra.This work not only provides an efficient CO 2 RR catalyst to high grade hydrocarbon fuel, but also opens new opportunities for designing and optimizing photocatalysts with atomic precision.

UV/Vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were conducted to reveal the light harvesting ability of samples in Figure 2a.It can be found that P/Cu SAsCN showed a broad and strongest absorption in the region of 500-800 nm compared with that of other samples.According to the Tauc plots (using the Kubelka-Munk equation), the band gap (E g ) of samples could be calculated as 2.81, 2.78, 2.49, and 2.37 eV for CN, PCN, Cu SAsCN, and P/Cu SAsCN, respectively (Figure S24).To determine the band structures more accurately, Mott-Schottky (M-S) and XPS valance band spectra were involved in evaluating the conductor band minimum (CBM) and valence band maximum (VBM) potentials of samples (Figure S25,S26). The results demonstrated that the decoration of Cu and P atoms in the CN matrix could narrow the band gap of bulk CN, enhancing the light harvesting ability of P/Cu SAsCN (Figure 2b).Meanwhile, the suitable energy band levels of P/Cu SAsCN presented an opportunity for straddling the reaction potentials of CO 2 to CO, CH 4 and C 2 H 6 (Figure 2c). The activities of photocatalytic CO 2 RR performances of the samples were evaluated in a gas-circulation system with a closed quartz reactor under light irradiation.The results (Figure 2d and Figure S27) showed that CO and CH 4 were the main products in the presence of bulk CN and PCN photocatalysts after ten hours of irradiation, only a trace amount of C 2 H 6 could be detected.We further found that the photocatalytic CO 2 RR activity of CN could be dramatically improved after introducing dual sites (Cu and P atoms) into the CN matrix, with the evolution rates of 765.9 and 465.2 mol g A 1 h A 1 for CO and CH 4 , respectively (Figure S27).More strikingly, the P/Cu SAsCN exhibited an excellent evolution rate of the C 2 H 6 product (616.6mol g A 1 h A 1 ), which was 26 times higher than that of Cu SAsCN (23.7 mol g A 1 h A 1 ).The photocatalytic performances of samples indicated that the introduction of P atoms might have great contribution on the production of C 2 H 6 over P/Cu SAsCN.In addition, the light-driven CO 2 RR performance of P/Cu SAsCN was a top-level photocatalyst compared with the previously reports (Table S4).The control experiments without detectable C 2 H 6 product in the dark, no catalyst or in the argon atmosphere, suggested that the photocatalyst, light irradiation and input CO 2 were indispensable for the photocatalytic CO 2 RR to C 2 H 6 (Figure 2e).For the stability test, no significant decrease in productions rates could be observed during the recycling process (Figure 2f and Figure S28).Also, the P/Cu SAsCN sample could be well maintained after the stability test (Figure S29-S32).In addition, the apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of P/Cu SAsCN was calculated to be 12.55 at 350 nm (Figure S33 and Table S5), which is much higher than that of other samples.All these results suggested that the constructed dual sites significantly enhanced photocatalytic CO 2 RR to hydrocarbon fuels, especially for C 2 H 6 . Dynamics studies of photo-generated carriers were carried out to explain why dual sites displayed excellent photocatalytic CO 2 RR performance.In Figure 3a, P/Cu SAsCN exhibited significantly enhanced photocurrent compared with that of Cu SAsCN.This could be attributed to the more efficient electron-hole pair separation and transfer after the introduction of P single atoms in the Cu SAsCN matrix.Simultaneously, the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of samples (Figure 3b) also demon-strated a smaller semicircle in Nyquist plots of P/Cu SAsCN compared to Cu SAsCN, suggesting easier migration and transmission of photo-generated carriers.Furthermore, time resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra were recorded to quantify the charge-carrier dynamic of the samples (Figure 3c).As depicted in Table S6, the average lifetime ( ave ) of CN, PCN, Cu SAsCN, and P/Cu SAsCN was calculated to be 2.47, 2.56, 2.84, and 7.13 ns, respectively.The lifetime of photo-induced carriers over P/ Cu SAsCN was remarkable longer than that of Cu SAsCN, which was beneficial for photocatalytic performance.In addition, the more efficient photoluminescence (PL) quenching of P/Cu SAsCN further indicated the efficient retarded the electron-hole recombination (Figure S34).The above results indicated that dual sites of P and Cu atoms might play an important roles in the enhancement of charge migration and transfer ability of P/Cu SAsCN under light irradiation.Quasi-in situ XPS instrument and in situ low-temperature electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurement were carried out to find experimental evidence for the contribution of P and Cu atoms on the photo-induced carriers' separation over P/Cu SAsCN photocatalyst. As for the quasi-in situ XPS measurement, a positive shift of P 2p could be observed after light irradiation upon P/Cu SAsCN, which indicated the increases in the valance of P after light irradiation (Figure 3d).This result demonstrated the hole capture roles of P atoms in P/Cu SAsCN during photocatalytic process.The P single atoms could trap the photo-generated holes, which was beneficial for the ) Schematic band structures of CN, PCN, Cu SAsCN, and P/Cu SAsCN.c) Schematic energy band levels of P/Cu SAsCN compared with the redox potentials of CO 2 to CO, CH 4 , and C 2 H 6 .d) Photocatalytic CO 2 RR production of C 2 H 6 over CN, PCN, Cu SAsCN, and P/Cu SAsCN.e) Time-dependent photocatalytic activity over P/Cu SAsCN for the production of C 2 H 6 and the control experiments under different conditions.f) Cyclic stability of C 2 H 6 production over P/Cu SAsCN. accumulation of photo-generated electrons on Cu sites to achieve multi-electron transfer process of CO 2 RR.Meanwhile, a negative shift of Cu 2p 3/2 binding energy occurred after light irradiation, which suggested the electron capture roles of Cu atoms in P/Cu SAsCN photocatalyst (Figure 3e).We further employed the in situ low-temperature electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) instrument to prove that the photo-generated electrons accumulated on Cu SAs sites over P/Cu SAsCN under light irradiation (Figure 3f and Figure S35).Taken together, the results of photogenerated carriers' dynamics studies well explain the remarkably higher separation efficiency of photo-generated carriers.Moreover, the holes' capture capability of P atoms in P/Cu SAsCN could enhance the accumulation of electrons on Cu SAs sites, and thus facilitate the multielectron transfer process on charge-enriched Cu sites during the photocatalytic CO 2 RR.The defect signals of samples in Figure S36 revealed that PA N and CuA N 4 dual sites had the dominant contribution for promoting carrier separation efficiency of P/Cu SAsCN. To investigate the carbon source of photocatalytic CO 2 RR upon P/Cu SAsCN, the 13 CO 2 isotope labeling experiment was carried out.As shown in Figure 4a, the signals with m/z values of 17, 29 and 32 assigned to 13 CH 4 , 13 CO and 13 C 2 H 6 are detected when 13 CO 2 is used as feedstock for photocatalytic CO 2 RR.Combined with the control experiments (Figure 4b) and the gas chromatograms (Figure S37, S38), we comfirmed that the generated CO and hydrocarbons on P/Cu SAsCN were definitely derived from the reduction of CO 2 rather than other sources.In situ FTIR measurement was further performed to detect the reaction intermediates, revealing the detailed reaction mechanism during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.To exclude the interferences of gaseous water, sacrificial agent (TEOA) and photocatalyst, the control experiments of in situ FTIR measurement have been conducted (Figure 4c, d and Figure S39, S40, see details in the Supporting Information).As shown in Figure 4e, the characteristic FTIR bands of CO (CO) can be observed (1944 and 2076 cm A 1 for CO; 2155 cm A 1 for CO gas), 4n, 9a,b which is the prerequisite for the further reduction of CO into CH 4 and C 2 H 6 .The CHO and CH 3 intermediates (1166 and 1454 cm A 1 ) can be detected, which are crucial for CO 2 RR to CH 4 . 9b,c9b,c OCA COH is one of the key intermediates to obtain C 2 products in CO 2 RR, which originates from the hydrogenation of OCA CO intermediates.The co-existence bands of 1584 cm A 1 and 1166 cm A 1 can be considered as the spectroscopic identification of OCA COH intermediates adsorbed on P/Cu SAsCN, which provides strong experimental evidence for CA C coupling during the photocatalytic CO 2 RR. 6c, 9d6c, 9d Compared with the in situ FTIR measurement with 12 CO 2 as feedstock, all the detected reaction intermediates shift evidently when using 13 CO 2 as feedstock (Fig- ure 4f). To further understand the specific structure, electronic properties and CO 2 RR mechanism of the constructed dual sites photocatalyst, we performed systematic DFT calculations.At first, we evaluated the stability parameters of P and Cu incorporated CN with different configurations by comparing the calculated total energies.Six different carbons (C1 to C6) are available on the surface of CN for P substitution (i.e., PCN), where C1 and C6 substitution with comparable total energies are the most stable (Figure S41).Further doping PCN with Cu has three different configurations (Figure S42), and the one with four CuA N bonds (d CuA N 2.02 A) is the most stable structure.Besides, the single Cu doped CN and other possible P/Cu SAsCN configurations were also given (Figure S43, 44).Indeed, the theoretically identified most stable P/Cu SAsCN structure matches very well with experimentally detected information, i.e., four coordinated Cu single atom.Therefore, we further investigated the electronic properties and CO 2 RR reaction mechanisms of P/Cu SAsCN catalyst to understand its intrinsic advantage. As shown in Figure 5a and 5b, the total density of states (TDOS) of CN and P/Cu SAsCN catalysts calculated by hybrid functional (HSE06) show obvious differences.Specifically, the band gap is narrowed from 3.15 eV (CN) to 2.34 eV (P/Cu SAsCN) after introducing of P and Cu atoms, and an obviously empty mid-gap state is observed below the conduction band, which corresponds to the tail absorption in the visible-light region (Figure 2a).Remarkably, the calculated band gap of P/Cu SAsCN (2.34 eV in Figure 5b) is in good agreement with the experimental spectrum data (2.37 eV in Figure 2b), which further validates the reliability of our theoretically identified model.The P-LDOS of P/Cu SAsCN demonstrates that the VBM has the contribution from P 2p, indicating the hole capture roles of P dopant.Moreover, the CBM of P/Cu SAsCN has been confirmed as A 0.78 V (vs.NHE) in the experimental part (Figure 2c), which is much higher than the reduction potential of CO 2 /C 2 H 6 A 0.27 V (vs.NHE).Thus, these unique dual sites features induced by doping make P/Cu SAsCN photocatalyst an ideal candidate for light-driven CO 2 reduction. To evaluate the rationality of our theoretical prediction, we further examined the reaction mechanism of CO 2 reduction to C 2 products on P/Cu SAsCN photocatalyst.Based on the in situ FTIR results, both CO and OCA COH (hydrogenation of OCA CO) intermediates have been detected during the photocatalytic CO 2 RR.We started our simulations of CO 2 RR from CO and focused on the formation of OCA CO and OCA COH intermediates.The low kinetic energy barrier of CO coupling on Cu sites (Figure 5c) and the difference charge density between OCA CO and Cu sites (Figure 5d) proved the formation of a stable CA C bond, paving a reasonable basis for further hydrogenation. 10Owing to the efficient carrier separation capability of dual sites catalyst, the charge-enriched Cu sites can be formed under light irradiation, which is more active for CO 2 reduction.The two-electron reduction of CO 2 to CO could be first triggered on the charge-enriched Cu sites.The FTIR bands of CO and CO(g) were observed in the region of 1900-2100 cm A 1 and became obvious under the subsequent illuminations in accordance with the high evolution rate of CO in our experimental results.Part of CO desorbed from Cu sites generate CO (g) (9': CH 3 CH 2 OH)!10: CH 3 CH 2 !CH 3 CH 3 (g) (Figure 5e).The hydrogenation of OCCO to OCA COH species with the largest uphill free energy change of 0.45 eV is the potential-determining step to ensure the formation of C 2 H 6 final products.Theoretically, only an energy input of 0.45 eV is needed to drive this reduction process, indicating the high photocatalytic activity of P/Cu SAsCN for CO 2 RR to C 2 H 6 (Figure 5e).Therefore, the reaction mechanism of photocatalytic CO 2 RR to C 2 H 6 has been deeply studied by the combination of in situ spectroscopic experiments and theoretical simulations."}]}}
