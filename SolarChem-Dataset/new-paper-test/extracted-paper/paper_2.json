    "content": "Metal nanoparticle (NP) cocatalysts are widely investigated for their ability to enhance the performance of photocatalytic materials; however, their practical application is often limited by the inherent instability under light irradiation.This challenge has catalyzed interest in exploring high-entropy alloys (HEAs), which, with their increased entropy and lower Gibbs free energy, provide superior stability.In this study, 3.5 nm-sized noble-metal-free NPs composed of a FeCoNiCuMn HEA are successfully synthesized.With theoretic calculation and experiments, the electronic structure of HEA in augmenting the catalytic CO 2 reduction has been uncovered, including the individual roles of each element and the collective synergistic effects.Then, their photocatalytic CO 2 reduction capabilities are investigated when immobilized on TiO 2 .HEA NPs significantly enhance the CO 2 photoreduction, achieving a 23-fold increase over pristine TiO 2 , with CO and CH 4 production rates of 235.2 and 19.9 mol g -1 h -1 , respectively.Meanwhile, HEA NPs show excellent stability under simulated solar irradiation, as well high-energy X-ray irradiation.This research emphasizes the promising role of HEA NPs, composed of earth-abundant elements, in revolutionizing the field of photocatalysis."

    "content": "To substantiate the rationale behind our design, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were employed to explore the structural and electronic properties of FeCoNiCuMn HEA.The electronic structure of this HEA and the role of each constituent element were evaluated through the partial density of states (PDOS) (Figure 1).The d-band center model is widely recognized for dictating catalytic activity in reduction reactions such as CO 2 reduction and hydrogen evolution. 17The substantial overlap observed among the 3d orbitals of all elements signifies robust bonding between different metals, which can not only facilitate the electron transfer between various metal sites, but also provide multiple active sites for reaction (Figure 1a). 18Specifically, the d-band center of Cu is situated at the lowest position near -2.37 eV (E f 0 eV, Figure 1b), designating Cu sites as electron reservoirs. 19Simultaneously, the centers of Mn-3d, Fe-3d, and Co-3d orbitals are positioned at -0.95, -1.08, and -1.24 eV near the Fermi level (Figure 1c-e), serving as electron depletion sites. 19Likewise, the close positioning of the d-band orbitals for these three metals facilitates efficient electron transfer among them.The 3d orbital of Ni (-1.47 eV, Figure 1f), positioned between Cu and Mn, Fe and Co-3d, contributes to alleviating the energy barrier of electron transfer from Mn, Fe and Co to Cu.With the formation of the HEA, the d-band center of HEA is located at -1.45 eV (Figure 1a), indicating a weaker binding strength with reaction intermediates in comparison to Mn, Fe, and Co, which facilitates the release of products from the surface, thereby enhancing catalytic activity. 20he solvothermal synthesis of FeCoNiCuMn HEA NPs is disclosed in detail in the Experimental Section (Supporting Information).The crystal structure of these NPs was confirmed through powder X-ray diffraction (XRD; Figure 2a).Notable diffraction peaks around 41 and 47 degrees are carefully indexed.The position of the diffraction peaks is different compared with those of pure Ni, Fe, Co, Cu, and Mn (Figure S1, Supporting Information), suggesting that these elements may form an alloy.These peaks can be fitted to the ( 111) and ( 200) planes of a face-centered cubic (fcc) phase, respectively. 21he crystal structure aligns with the cubic Fm-3m space group, featuring a unit cell parameter of 0.389 nm.For a better understanding, a schematic representation of the fcc alloy is provided in the inset of Figure 2a.High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) provides further details on the NP structure. As depicted in Figure 2b, the HEA NPs exhibit an average diameter of 3.5 0.2 nm, while Figure 2c shows a lattice spacing of 0.221 nm, corresponding to the (111) plane. 22Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy mapping (Figure 2d-i emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES), as presented in Figure S3, Supporting Information.Taken together, these structural results provide conclusive evidence for the successful formation of FeCoNiCuMn HEA NPs. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was employed to probe the chemical states of the Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Mn in NPs.The XPS survey spectrum of the sample, as depicted in Figure S4, Supporting Information, unequivocally affirms the presence of Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Mn elements. 23The high-resolution XPS spectra of Fe 2p, Co 2p, Ni 2p, Cu 2p, and Mn 2p exhibit wellfitted peaks corresponding to both the metallic state and multiple oxidation states for each element.As shown in Figure S5, Supporting Information, compared to standard values (Mn (0), Fe (0), Co (0), Ni (0), and Cu (0)), 24 the binding energy of Mn, Fe, and Co metallic states in HEA exhibits higher energy, while Cu's metallic state shows lower energy, and Ni aligns well with the standard value.These results suggest increased electron density in Cu and electron deficiency in Mn, Co, and Fe, indicating electron transfer among multiple metals in the HEA NPs, from Mn, Co, and Fe to Cu atoms, which can be attributed to differences in electronegativity (Mn Fe Co Ni Cu).These findings are well consistent with PDOS calculations, that Mn, Fe, and Co serve as electron-depleting elements and Cu acts as electron reservoir.In addition to the metallic state, the oxidation states of each element can be indexed, which are ascribed to partial oxidation induced by the high surface energy of the NPs. 23a23a Such phenomena, characterized by the coexistence of metallic and oxidized states in HEA NPs, have been reported before. 25uilding on these theoretical and experimental insights, the synthesized HEA NPs were immobilized onto TiO 2 substrates via impregnation for application in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.The HEA NPs and TiO 2 can be combined through electrostatic interactions, as confirmed by Zeta potential analysis (Table S1, Supporting Information).These composite materials are identified as x-HEA/TiO 2 , where \"x\" signifies the weight ratio of the HEA to the total composite material.The precise HEA loading in each x-HEA/TiO 2 was accurately determined using ICP-AES in Table S2, Supporting Information.Due to the low weight ratio of HEA, structurally sensitive synchrotron-based powder Xray diffraction (SXRD, Figure S6, Supporting Information) was employed to confirm the preserved HEA phase when included in the 0.5-HEA/TiO 2 system as a co-catalyst.In these data, besides the anatase and rutile phases in TiO 2 , two additional peaks are resolved and can be indexed to the HEA NPs.HAADF-STEM was performed to confirm the loading of HEA on the TiO 2 surface (Figure S7, Supporting Information).However, because of the close atomic numbers of Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Mn (Z 25-29), and Ti (Z 22), these elements present similar contrast levels in HAADF-STEM image, posing a challenge in detecting HEA NPs.As a result, only a small amount of HEA NPs at the edge of TiO 2 particles can be observed.STEM-EDX mapping of HEA/TiO 2 (Figure S8, Supporting Information) reveals the colorization of the different HEA elements with Ti, indicating that HEA NPs are highly dispersed on the TiO 2 surface.UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy in Figure S9, Supporting Information reveals enhanced visible light absorption upon the deposition of HEA NPs.Despite this, both TiO 2 /HEA and TiO 2 exhibit a consistent band gap of 3.0 eV at their absorption edges, suggesting that the ob-served increase in visible light absorption can be ascribed to the presence of HEA NPs. Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O under solar light illumination was employed to assess the photocatalytic activity of HEA/TiO 2 samples (Figure 3a).Over 4 h of irradiation, bare TiO 2 exhibits a moderate CO and CH 4 production rate of 10.9 and 0.7 mol g -1 h -1 , respectively.The HEA/TiO 2 composites demonstrate a significantly enhanced CO and CH 4 production rate; with 0.25 wt HEA, the CO and CH 4 generation rate is 80 and 16 mol g -1 h -1 , respectively.With increasing HEA NP content, the CO 2 reduction efficiency exhibits a gradual improvement with HEA loading to reach an optimal activity for 0.5 wt HEA, where the CO and CH 4 generation rate is 235.2 and 19.9 mol g -1 h -1 , respectively, 23-fold improvement compared to the pristine TiO 2 sample.This product yield rate stands as the highest reported among non-noble metal-modified TiO 2 photocatalysts (Table S3, Supporting Information).The apparent quantum yield of fuels at 380 nm for the 0.5-HEA/TiO 2 composite is 0.17, closely approaching the 0.2 achieved with Au NPs modified TiO 2 in our previous work that we introduced twinning crystal planes into fcc phase Au NPs to enhance the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance over Au/TiO 2 . 1d1d In comparison to other reported noble-metal modified TiO 2 photocatalysts, HEA/TiO 2 also presents comparable activity in CO 2 photoreduction (Table S3, Supporting Information).However, when the HEA content exceeds 0.5 wt, its presence adversely affects the overall performance.This can be attributed to the fact that an excessive amount of HEA may act as a charge recombination center and impede the light absorption of TiO 2 . 26Control experiments (Figure S10, Supporting Information) demonstrate that no products are detected in the absence of catalysts, CO 2 , and/or light irradiation, affirming the light-driven photocatalytic nature of the reaction.Additionally, the visible light absorbed by HEA does not contribute to the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance.An isotope experiment using 13 CO 2 (Figure S11, Supporting Information) confirms that the produced CO and CH 4 originated from CO 2 reduction.More importantly, the photostability of HEA/TiO 2 was tested over a long-term photocatalytic experiment (36 h in total, 9 consecutive cycles, 4 h for each cycle), in which no discernible decrease in activity can be observed (Figure 3b).The structure of the HEA/TiO 2 after the 36 h stability test was determined by SXRD.As shown in Figure S6, Supporting Information, SXRD patterns before and after reactions remain similar, suggesting no structural changes over HEA NPs during the reaction process.Furthermore, after 36 h in the photocatalytic reaction, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Mn are still uniformly distributed in the catalyst as revealed by STEM-EDX elements mapping (Figure S12, Supporting Information), demonstrating the stability of the HEA NPs.Additionally, the X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) analysis corroborated the constancy of local electronic structures of Fe, Cu, Ni, Cu, and Mn elements in the 0.5-HEA/TiO 2 sample after the photocatalytic reaction (Figure S13, Supporting Information), indicating the high stability of 0.5-HEA/TiO 2 composite.To further support this point, we exposed the HEA materials to a strong and sustained ionizing radiation (12 keV, above the K edges of all metal constituents) using a focused and extremely bright synchrotron radiation source (1.4 10 12 photons s -1 ; BM01 at ESRF) for 13 h.Evaluating the SXRD patterns (Figure S14, Supporting Information) before, during, and after the exposure, we observed that the patterns coincide, with no additional peaks, for example, of the pure metals that can be indexed.This observation supports the claim of the absence of structural change and underscores the high robustness of the HEA material.To elucidate the role of HEA NPs in photoreaction, a series of photoelectrochemical characterizations were conducted on both TiO 2 and the HEA/TiO 2 composite.The on-off photocurrent (Figure S15, Supporting Information) reveals a significantly higher photocurrent for 0.5-HEA/TiO 2 compared to blank TiO 2 .On the other hand, the response rate of the photocurrent on TiO 2 is much slower than that on 0.5-HEA/TiO 2 .Moreover, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS, Figure S16, Supporting Information) has been conducted on both TiO 2 and 0.5-HEA/TiO 2 samples to examine the charge transfer resistance.The results indicate a reduced resistance for charge transfer after the incorporation of HEA.These results suggest that HEA NPs facilitate the separation and transport of photogenerated electron-hole pairs produced in TiO 2 . 7a,277a,27 Furthermore, the cathode polarization curves (Figure S17, Supporting Information) indicate that the onset potential over 0.5-HEA/TiO 2 is smaller than those in TiO 2 , signifying that HEA NPs serve as reduction sites to improve the reduction ability. 28In addition, as revealed by the ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy, the work function for HEA is 4.7 eV versus Vacuum, which is below that of TiO 2 (3.8 eV versus Vacuum), 29 suggesting a Schottky barrier formation at the HEA/TiO 2 interface (Figure S18, Supporting Information), which can retard the backflow of photogenerated electrons.Based on these experimental results, it can be concluded that HEA NPs function as electron reservoirs, extracting electrons from TiO 2 , and also serve as reaction sites to drive CO 2 reduction with these electrons. Then, to gain insights into the reaction details over the HEA NPs, we conducted theoretical calculations to investigate the thermodynamics of CO 2 -to-fuels conversion.As depicted in Figure 3c, HEA NPs exhibit favorable CO 2 adsorption with a negative energy barrier of -0.05 eV.This aligns with the CO 2 adsorption isotherms (Figure S19, Supporting Information), indicating HEA NPs could enhance the CO 2 adsorption on the surface, despite the surface area decreasing slightly after HEA modification (Figure S20 and Table S4, Supporting Information).In the CO 2 -to-CO pathway, intermediates such as COOH and (CO H 2 O) are yielded spontaneously.However, desorption of CO and H 2 O from HEA presents positive energy barriers, with CO desorption having a notably large Gibbs energy barrier of 0.88 eV, marking it the thermodynamically ratedetermining step of the entire reaction.This observation is supported by CO temperature-programmed desorption profiles of HEA/TiO 2 (Figure S21, Supporting Information), in which HEA presents a strong chemisorption of CO, with desorption initiating at 300 C and peaking around 550 C.In the potential energy diagram of the CO 2 -to-CH 4 pathway, the high adsorption energy of the H 2 CO intermediate over HEA, resulting in a 0.98 eV Gibbs energy barrier, emerges as the rate-determining step for CH 4 formation.Notably, this value exceeds the desorption energy of the CO molecule on HEA surface (0.88 eV), indicating that HEA favors the formation of CO over CH 4 .These DFT calculations are in accordance with the results of the photocatalytic experiments, where CO is identified as the primary product.These DFT calculation results are further confirmed by in situ Fouriertransform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) which was conducted to detect the intermediates involved in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction process over 0.5-HEA/TiO 2 .As depicted in Figure 3d, in the dark condition, no peaks are observed.Upon light irradiation, five peaks at 1048, 1087, 1383, 1452, and 1633 cm -1 are identified. 30The prominent peak at 1633 cm -1 corresponds to the COOH species, 1c,d a crucial intermediate in CO formation.The CHO group, identified at 1087 cm -1 , is generated through the rapid protonation of CO, 15a but its intensity is notably weak, implying the swift release of CO from the surface.This observation aligns with the absence of a CO absorption band between 2000 and 2100 cm -1 .Additionally, minor peaks at 1383 and 1048 cm -1 , attributed to CH 3 O and 1452 cm -1 for the H 2 COO group, 31 are present.These intermediates are linked to the generation of CH 4 through CO 2 reduction.However, the intensity of these intermediates is markedly weaker compared to that of the CO intermediate.These findings align with our DFT calculations, providing further confirmation that CO is the primary product over HEA/TiO 2 .In addition, the in situ FTIR analysis of TiO 2 is also performed.Both the COOH and CH 3 O species as the important intermediates for CO and CH 4 formation are detected (Figure S22, Supporting Information), indicating a similar photocatalytic CO 2 reduction process over TiO 2 when compared with that of HEA/TiO 2 .Based on the DFT calculations and in situ FTIR, it is speculated that the most likely reduction path from CO 2 to CO could be as follows:"
