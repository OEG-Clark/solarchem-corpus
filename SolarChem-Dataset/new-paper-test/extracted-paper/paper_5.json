    "content": "Recently, a novel step-scheme (S-scheme) heterojunction was proposed and has attracted researchers' attention. 2324252627282930313233343536 Usually, S-scheme heterojunction consists of reduction photocatalyst (RP) and oxidation photocatalyst (OP).Besides, the directional migration of free electrons will lead to band bending and internal electric field (IEF) at their interface owing to the work function difference.Notably, under the influence of IEF, the photogenerated electrons of OP with weak reduction ability can recombine with the photogenerated holes of RP with weak oxidation ability; while those with strong redox abilities are preserved.Therefore, reasonable construction of TiO 2 -based S-scheme heterojunction is of great significance to improve photocatalytic reaction performance.Apart from the charge carrier separation, the morphology of photocatalysts is another important factor to influence the photocatalytic performance. 15,17,19,37,38Photocatalysts with hollow structures have attracted great attention owing to manifold advantages including larger specific surface area, abundant active sites, shortened diffusion distance as well as improved light reflection and scattering. 37,394041424344 Therefore, the design of hollow S-scheme heterojunction photocatalyst is of vital importance to enhance photocatalytic performance.ZnIn 2 S 4 , as a typical reduction photocatalyst, stands out for its layered structure, narrow bandgap, suitable redox potentials, and good chemical stability.And it has been used for various photocatalytic applications including hydrogen production, CO 2 reduction, and organic degradation. 45464748495051 Unfortunately, pristine ZnIn 2 S 4 photocatalyst shows low photocatalytic efficiency owing to the fast recombination of photogenerated charge carriers. 4546474849 Considering the suitable match of band gap of ZnIn 2 S 4 and TiO 2 for S-scheme heterojunction, 27,52 we construct the hollow TiO 2 ZnIn 2 S 4 core-shell structure.Up to now, to the best of our knowledge, it has never been reported.Herein, we grow ZnIn 2 S 4 nanosheets on the outer surface of TiO 2 hollow spheres by in situ chemical bath deposition reaction.This rational design is not only able to provide large specific surface areas and abundant reaction sites for PCR reaction, but also can effectively suppress the recombination of useful photogenerated electrons and holes.As a result, the optimized TiO 2 ZnIn 2 S 4 heterojunction exhibits high PCR performance, and the total CO 2 photoreduction conversion rates (the sum yield of CO, CH 3 OH and CH 4 ) are obviously higher than those of blank ZnIn 2 S 4 , TiO 2 , and ex situ prepared TiO 2 -ZnIn 2 S 4 composite.Finally, S-scheme mechanism is also thoroughly analyzed and discussed in this work.Reasonable design of efficient hierarchical photocatalysts has gained significant attention.Herein, a step-scheme (S-scheme) core-shell TiO 2 ZnIn 2 S 4 heterojunction is designed for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.The optimized sample exhibits much higher CO 2 photoreduction conversion rates (the sum yield of CO, CH 3 OH, and CH 4 ) than the blank control, i.e., ZnIn 2 S 4 and TiO 2 .The improved photocatalytic performance can be attributed to the inhibited recombination of photogenerated charge carriers induced by S-scheme heterojunction.The improvement is also attributed to the large specific surface areas and abundant active sites.Meanwhile, S-scheme photogenerated charge transfer mechanism is testified by in situ irradiated X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, work function calculation, and electron paramagnetic resonance measurements.This work provides an effective strategy for designing highly efficient heterojunction photocatalysts for conversion of solar fuels."

    "content": "The preparation processes of hierarchical TiO 2 ZnIn 2 S 4 coreshell hollow spheres (CSHS) are illustrated in Figure 1a.Firstly, SiO 2 spheres with average diameters of 350 nm as the hard-templates are prepared by a modified Stober method (Figure S1a, Supporting Information). 53Afterwards, TiO 2 nanoparticles are coated on the surface of SiO 2 spheres to form TiO 2 SiO 2 solid spheres with average diameters of 500 nm via versatile kinetics-controlled coating and thermal annealing (Figure S1b, Supporting Information). 54Subsequently, these TiO 2 SiO 2 solid spheres are etched with HF solution to remove the SiO 2 templates, and then TiO 2 hollow spheres are obtained.Fieldemission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images clearly show that the sphere structures are intact after HF solution treatment (Figure 1b, Figure S1c, Supporting Information).Afterwards, hierarchical TiO 2 ZnIn 2 S 4 CSHS are successfully acquired by in situ chemical bath deposition.During the reaction processes, due to the positively charged surface of TiO 2 (pH 2.5) (Figure S2, Supporting Information), the negative-charged S 2-ions released from the decomposition of thioacetamide can be adsorbed on the outer surface of TiO 2 hollow spheres through electrostatic interactions.Further reactions between positive metal ions (Zn 2 and In 3 ) and negative S 2-ions attached on TiO 2 promote the formation of the ZnIn 2 S 4 nanosheets on the outer surface of TiO 2 hollow spheres with tight contact (Figure 1c).Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image clearly validates the formation of hierarchical TiO 2 ZnIn 2 S 4 CSHS (Figure 1d).Meanwhile, its corresponding high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image indicates that the spacing of distinct lattice fringes with are 0.33 and 0.35 nm, which can be respectively indexed into the (101) planes of ZnIn 2 S 4 and TiO 2 (Figure 1e).Furthermore, highangle annular dark-field (HAADF) image (Figure 1f) and corresponding elemental mapping images (Figure 1g-k) clearly demonstrate the distribution of Ti, O, Zn, In, and S elements in TiO 2 ZnIn 2 S 4 composite.Most notably, the innermost region of TiO 2 hollow sphere core and the outer ZnIn 2 S 4 nanosheet shell can be distinguished.These results directly indicate that hierarchical TiO 2 ZnIn 2 S 4 CSHS are successfully constructed.By contrast, in the absence of TiO 2 hollow sphere core, random aggregation of blank ZnIn 2 S 4 is observed (Figure S1d, Supporting Information). The X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns were measured to identify the phase structures of samples.As presented in Figure 2a, the peaks of TiO 2 and ZnIn 2 S 4 correspond to the typical diffraction peaks of anatase TiO 2 (JCPDS No. 84-1286) and hexagonal ZnIn 2 S 4 (JCPDS No. 72-0773), 45,47 respectively.Furthermore, the presence of TiO 2 and ZnIn 2 S 4 in the TiO 2 ZnIn 2 S 4 can be observed.Besides, compared with the pristine TiO 2 and ZnIn 2 S 4 , the positions of diffraction peaks in TiO 2 ZnIn 2 S 4 composite are almost unchanged, indicating that the growth of ZnIn 2 S 4 does not alter their respective crystal structures. To identify the surface element composition and electronic chemical states of TiO 2 , ZnIn 2 S 4 , and TiO 2 ZnIn 2 S 4 , X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was employed.As presented in Figure S3 (Supporting Information), XPS survey spectra indicate that Ti, O, Zn, In, and S elements can be detected in the TiO 2 ZnIn 2 S 4 composite, which are in according with the EDS results.Besides, as for Ti, the peaks centered at 458.5 and 464.2 eV can be assigned to the 2p 3/2 and 2p 1/2 of Ti, respectively (Figure 2b). 24,55The peaks centered at 529.4 and 531.4 eV can be ascribed to the Ti-O bond and surface hydroxyl (-OH) group, respectively (Figure 2c). 23,55While for Zn, the peaks located at 1022.0 and 1045.1 eV are attributed to its 2p 3/2 and 2p 1/2 orbitals, respectively (Figure 2d). 454647 The binding energy difference is about 23.1 eV, which is typical of Zn 2 in ZnIn 2 S 4 . 454647 In Figure 2e, the peaks located at 444.9 and 452.5 eV can be attributed to the 3d 5/2 and 3d 3/2 of In, respectively, suggesting that its valence state is 3. 454647 In Figure 2f, the peaks centered at 161.6 and 162.8 eV, assigning to the 2p 3/2 and 2p 1/2 of S, respectively, is the characteristic of S 2-and in agreement with the literature. 454647 Notably, the electron binding energy of element originates from the strong Coulomb attraction between the outer electrons of atom and atomic nucleus. 20,56,57Meanwhile, the changes of element binding energy can directly reflect the changes of electron density. 20,56,57This means that the decrease of electron density can lead to the increase of binding energy.Contrarily, the decrease of binding energy is owing to the fact that the atom obtains electrons. 20,56,57Therefore, the binding energy change can be used to examine the direction of charge carrier transfer in heterojunction photocatalysts. 23,27,55,58As shown in Figure 2b,c, compared with TiO 2 , the binding energies of O 1s and Ti 2p in TiO 2 ZnIn 2 S 4 composite obviously shift toward lower energy levels in darkness, indicating an increase in the electron density of TiO 2 . 23,55In contrast, compared with ZnIn 2 S 4 , the binding energies of Zn 2p, In 3d, and S 2p in TiO 2 ZnIn 2 S 4 significantly shift to higher energy levels in darkness (Figure 2d-f), implying that the electrons migrate from ZnIn 2 S 4 to TiO 2 .Furthermore, when in situ irradiated XPS measurements are performed, 20,23,27,55565758 compared with TiO 2 ZnIn 2 S 4 in darkness, the binding energies of O 1s and Ti 2p in the TiO 2 ZnIn 2 S 4 composite under light irradiation markedly move to higher energy levels (Figure 2b,c); while the binding energies of Zn 2p, In 3d and S 2p in the nanocomposite obviously shift to lower energy levels (Figure 2d-f), suggesting the photogenerated electrons transfer from TiO 2 to ZnIn 2 S 4 under light irradiation. 27,58Therefore, these XPS results provide important evidences of the charge carrier transfer pathway across the TiO 2 ZnIn 2 S 4 heterojunction interface under light irradiation.In detail, the migration of photogenerated electrons from TiO 2 to ZnIn 2 S 4 , matching well with the S-scheme mechanism. Most importantly, the difference in work functions (W) or Fermi levels (E f ) for semiconductor photocatalysts is the internal driving force of charge transfer in heterojunction nanocomposite.W of TiO 2 , ZnIn 2 S 4 , and TiO 2 ZnIn 2 S 4 were obtained by Kevin probe measurements. 58,59As a result, W of TiO 2 , ZnIn 2 S 4 , and TiO 2 ZnIn 2 S 4 are determined to be 4.69, 3.92 and 4.31 eV, respectively (Figure 3a, Figure S4 and Table S1, Supporting Information).E f of samples is calculated on the basis of the following equation ( 1): where V ac is the vacuum level (assumed as 0 eV). 60Thus, E f of TiO 2 , ZnIn 2 S 4 and TiO 2 ZnIn 2 S 4 are determined to be -4.69,-3.92 and -4.31 eV, respectively.Obviously, TiO 2 has a larger W (4.61 eV) and lower E f (-4.61 eV), ZnIn 2 S 4 has a smaller W (3.92 eV) and higher E f (-3.92 eV) (Figure 3a).Moreover, when TiO 2 ZnIn 2 S 4 heterojunction is formed, the electrons will transfer from ZnIn 2 S 4 to TiO 2 easily until the E f at the interface tends to equilibrate (Figure 3b).Concurrently, ZnIn 2 S 4 shows upward interface band bending and is positively charged at the interface due to loss of electrons; while TiO 2 exhibits downward interface band bending and is negatively charged at the interface due to accumulation of electrons (Figure 3b).In consequence, the electrons transfer creates an IEF at the interfaces pointing from ZnIn 2 S 4 to TiO 2 (Figure 3b). 23,24,27,55,61When TiO 2 ZnIn 2 S 4 heterojunction is exposed to light, electrons are excited from VB to CB of ZnIn 2 S 4 and TiO 2 , respectively.Under the combined effect of IEF, interface band bending and Coulomb interaction, the photogenerated electrons in CB of TiO 2 easily transfer to VB of ZnIn 2 S 4 and recombine with the photogenerated holes of ZnIn 2 S 4 (Figure 3c). 23,24,27,55,61his interfacial charge transfer behavior of TiO 2 ZnIn 2 S 4 heterojunction accords with the XPS results and is in agreement with the S-scheme mechanism.Meanwhile, the photogenerated holes on VB of TiO 2 and the photogenerated electrons on CB of ZnIn 2 S 4 are maintained, which participate in the photocatalytic redox reaction, respectively (Figure 3c).Besides, due to the intimate interface contact between ZnIn 2 S 4 and TiO 2 , the intensity of IEF at interface is greatly enhanced, which is favorable for the interfacial photogenerated charge transfer as well as effectively improve the PCR performance.Meanwhile, the band structures of samples were measured by Mott-Schottky (M-S) and UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-vis DRS spectra) measurements.M-S plots of TiO 2 and ZnIn 2 S 4 exhibit positive slopes, suggesting that both samples are n-type semiconductors (Figure 4a). 55,58,62,63Moreover, the flat-band potentials (E fb ) of TiO 2 and ZnIn 2 S 4 are -0.22 and -0.86 V (versus normal hydrogen electrode (NHE), at pH 0. Note: The potentials in this paper are relative to that of NHE unless otherwise mentioned.),respectively.Usually, the E fb of n-type semiconductor roughly equals to the conduction band (CB) potential. 55,58,62,64Besides, the band gap (E g ) of TiO 2 (3.20 eV) and ZnIn 2 S 4 (2.43 eV) are obtained by UV-vis DRS spectra and Tauc plots (Figure 4b,c), respectively.Therefore, considering the CB positions and E g of TiO 2 and ZnIn 2 S 4 , the valence band (VB) potentials of TiO 2 and ZnIn 2 S 4 are 2.98 and 1.57V, respectively.Meanwhile, according to the above results and analysis, the band structures of TiO 2 and ZnIn 2 S 4 are presented in Figure 4d.Noticeably, the reduction potentials of CO, CH 3 OH and CH 4 are -0.12,0.03 and 0.17 V, respectively, 27,58,65 implying that TiO 2 and ZnIn 2 S 4 are thermodynamically feasible for converting CO 2 into CO, CH 3 OH and CH 4 (Figure 4d). Additionally, to further validate the S-scheme mechanism of TiO 2 ZnIn 2 S 4 heterojunction, the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra of hydroxyl (OH) and superoxide (O 2 -) radicals via 5, 5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) were measured. 24,27,32The redox potentials of in Figure 4d. 24,27,32Meanwhile, EPR spectra of DMPO-OH and DMPO-O 2 -adducts of TiO 2 , ZnIn 2 S 4 and TiO 2 ZnIn 2 S 4 are detected under irradiation, respectively (Figure 4e,f).It can be seen that the DMPO-OH signal of TiO 2 ZnIn 2 S 4 is obviously stronger than that of pristine TiO 2 ; while the DMPO-OH signal of pristine ZnIn 2 S 4 is hardly observed (Figure 4e).Moreover, the DMPO-O 2 -intensity of TiO 2 ZnIn 2 S 4 is evidently higher than that of pristine ZnIn 2 S 4 ; while the DMPO-O 2 -intensity of pristine TiO 2 is very weak (Figure 4f).The main reason is that the oxidation potential of photogenerated holes on VB of TiO 2 (2.98 V) is more positive than the redox potential of H 2 O/OH (2.37 V) or OH -/OH (2.69 V) couples; while the reduction potential of photogenerated electrons on CB of TiO 2 (-0.22 V) is positive than the redox potential of O 2 /O 2 -couples (-0.33 V) (Figure 4d). 24,27,32But for ZnIn 2 S 4 , the trend is reversed (Figure 4d).Notably, if the charge transfer mechanism of TiO 2 ZnIn 2 S 4 heterojunction conforms to traditional type-II heterojunction, the generation of OH and O 2 -radicals are not facilitated (Figure 4g).However, it is notable that for the DMPO-OH or DMPO-O 2 -adducts, the signal intensity of TiO 2 ZnIn 2 S 4 are obviously stronger than those of pristine TiO 2 and ZnIn 2 S 4 (Figure 4e,f).These results indicate that the photogenerated charge transfer mechanism of TiO 2 ZnIn 2 S 4 heterojunction is in agreement with the S-scheme mechanism rather than traditional type-II heterojunction (Figure 4h). 24,27,32 -adducts (in methanol solution) over TiO 2 , ZnIn 2 S 4 , and TiO 2 ZnIn 2 S 4 under illumination for 2 min.Schematic diagrams of g) conventional type-II and h) S-scheme heterojunction. www.small-journal.comPCR reaction activities of different samples were measured under full-spectrum irradiation.As shown in Figure 5a, CO, CH 3 OH and CH 4 are the major photoreduction products of samples.Obviously, total CO 2 photoreduction conversion rates (the sum yield of CO, CH 3 OH and CH 4 ) of TiO 2 hollow spheres (4.13 mol h -1 g -1 ) are higher than those of bulk TiO 2 nonhollow structure sample (Figure S5, Supporting Information) (2.04 mol h -1 g -1 ), showing the advantage of hollow structure in the PCR reaction.Besides, total CO 2 photoreduction conversion rates of 6.65 mol h -1 g -1 are achieved by pristine ZnIn 2 S 4 nanosheets.Gratifyingly, the construction of heterojunction obviously elevates the PCR activities.In particular, the total CO 2 photoreduction conversion rates have increased by 2.75 and 4.43 times compared with the pristine ZnIn 2 S 4 and TiO 2 , respectively, attaining 18.32 mol h -1 g -1 .Moreover, this PCR reaction performance is higher than that of many other photocatalysts under similar conditions (Table S2, Supporting Information).Interestingly, undetected hydrogen is owing to the fact that the gas (CO 2 H 2 O)-solid (photocatalyst) reaction system is more favorable for adsorption and activation of CO 2 , thus the hydrogen evolution reaction is inhibited. 66,67esides, the amount of photooxidation product O 2 was also close to its theoretical value (Table S3, Supporting Information).Meanwhile, the oxygen evolution rate of TiO 2 ZnIn 2 S 4 is obviously higher than those of pristine ZnIn 2 S 4 nanosheets and TiO 2 hollow spheres (Figure 5a).Based on the above analysis, the improvement of PCR performance can be ascribed to construction of S-scheme heterojunction.The TiO 2 ZnIn 2 S 4 S-scheme heterojunction can efficiently facilitate the separation and transfer of photogenerated carriers.Meanwhile, a large number of useful photogenerated electrons with strong reduction ability can be retained in the CB of ZnIn 2 S 4 to the CO 2 photoreduction reaction, while the photogenerated holes with strong oxidation ability can be retained in the VB of TiO 2 to the H 2 O photooxidation reaction.Besides, the PCR performance of TiO 2 ZnIn 2 S 4 nearly retains after running for three cycles (Figure 5b).XRD of TiO 2 ZnIn 2 S 4 shows no noticeable change before and after PCR reaction (Figure 5c), suggesting the good stability of the TiO 2 ZnIn 2 S 4 heterojunction.Moreover, to investigate the carbon origin of photoreduction products, 13 CH 4 (m/z 17) and 13 CO (m/z 29) characteristic peaks are detected in 13 C-labeled CO 2 , and 12 CH 4 (m/z 16) and 12 CO (m/z 28) are detected in 12 C-labeled CO 2 sources by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry under the same conditions (Figure S6, Supporting Information).These results indicate that the detected photoreduction products originate from CO 2 instead of impurities. Additionally, it is widely known that larger specific surface area of photocatalysts is beneficial to PCR reaction owing to the fact that it can provide the abundant active sites. 19,37herefore, the surface area was evaluated via nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms.As shown in Figure 6a, all the samples display typical type IV isotherms with the type H3 hysteresis loop, signifying their mesoporous structures. 45,47,54eanwhile, the pore-size distribution curves further testify their mesoporous structures (Figure 6a (inset)).Moreover, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area (S BET ) of TiO 2 ZnIn 2 S 4 (107 m 2 g -1 ) is larger than those of TiO 2 (78 m 2 g -1 ) and ZnIn 2 S 4 (102 m 2 g -1 ) (Table S4, Supporting Information).Besides, large specific surface area of the composite can supply abundant surface active and adsorption sites, which is favorable for the capture and activation of CO 2 .Meanwhile, as shown in Figure 6b, the CO 2 adsorption capacity of TiO 2 ZnIn 2 S 4 (0.12 mmol g -1 ) is higher than those of TiO 2 (0.09 mmol g -1 ) and ZnIn 2 S 4 (0.10 mmol g -1 ).Besides, the adsorption energy (E ad ) of CO 2 on ZnIn 2 S 4 (-0.09eV) is more negative than that on TiO 2 (-0.06 eV) (Figure S7, Supporting Information), which indicates that the adsorbed CO 2 on ZnIn 2 S 4 is more stable than that on TiO 2 .Together, all of these results confirm the superiority of TiO 2 ZnIn 2 S 4 over pristine TiO 2 and ZnIn 2 S 4 in PCR. To further clarify the excellent CO 2 photoreduction activity of TiO 2 ZnIn 2 S 4 , photoluminescence (PL) and photoelectrochemical characterizations were performed.As displayed in Figure 6c, the steady-state PL intensity of TiO 2 ZnIn 2 S 4 is obviously lower than those of pristine TiO 2 and ZnIn 2 S 4 , indicating that construction of S-scheme heterojunction photocatalyst can largely inhibit the recombination of photogenerated charge carriers. 55,58Moreover, as shown in Figure 6d, the average PL lifetime ( ave ) of TiO 2 ZnIn 2 S 4 (2.43 ns) is obviously shorter than those of pristine TiO 2 (3.35 ns) and ZnIn 2 S 4 (4.81 ns), confirming a more efficient separation and transfer of photogenerated carriers in the S-scheme heterojunction. 23,45,47,55,58Additionally, TiO 2 ZnIn 2 S 4 heterojunction shows the smaller electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) radius and higher photocurrent density than those of pristine TiO 2 and ZnIn 2 S 4 (Figure 6e,f), reaffirming the highly efficient photogenerated charge carriers separation and transfer over TiO 2 ZnIn 2 S 4 heterojunction. 45,47,58,62,64For comparison, control experiments indicate that the PCR performance of a physical mixture of TiO 2 and ZnIn 2 S 4 (TiO 2 -ZnIn 2 S 4 ) is much inferior to that of TiO 2 ZnIn 2 S 4 under the same condition (Figure S8a, Supporting Information).Besides, the EIS radius of TiO 2 -ZnIn 2 S 4 is much larger than that of TiO 2 ZnIn 2 S 4 (Figure S8b, Supporting Information).Therefore, these results imply that the crucial roles of intimate interfacial contact and hierarchical core-shell hollow structures in TiO 2 ZnIn 2 S 4 heterojunction for PCR reaction. In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (in situ DRIFTS) can be used to directly detect the carbon-based groups formed on the surface of photocatalyst during the PCR reaction, which is helpful to analyze the formation mechanism of reaction intermediates. 68Therefore, to get further insight into the evolution process of PCR over the surface of TiO 2 ZnIn 2 S 4 , in situ DRIFTS was analyzed.As shown in Figure 7a, without introducing CO 2 and H 2 O gas in the dark, no absorption peaks can be detected (Figure 7a and 1557 cm -1 ) and bidentate carbonate species (b-CO 3 2-, 1317, 1519 and 1653 cm -1 ) can be detected. 39,55,58These peaks mean that the CO 2 and H 2 O are effectively adsorbed and activated on the surface of TiO 2 ZnIn 2 S 4 .Furthermore, some new peaks can be observed under irradiation condition (Figure 7a(iii)).The emerging peaks can be attributed to carboxylate species (COO -, 1342 and 1363 cm -1 ), formaldehyde species (HCHO -, 1507 and 1773 cm -1 ), formic acid species (HCOO -, 1573 cm -1 ) and methoxy groups (CH 3 O -, 1682, 1702 and 1745 cm -1 ). 39,55,58Meanwhile, these peaks of intermediates reveal that the effective photocatalytic activation and reaction of CO 2 occur on the surface of TiO 2 ZnIn 2 S 4 .Based on the previous reports, 2,3,39,55,58 the COO -, HCHO -, HCOO -and CH 3 O -species are assigned to the important intermediates of PCR reaction.Therefore, according to analysis on the above of intermediate species, a possible CO 2 photoreduction conversion pathway over TiO 2 ZnIn 2 S 4 surface can be proposed in Figure 7b.Under light irradiation, CO 2 molecules are adsorbed and activated on TiO 2 ZnIn 2 S 4 surface.First, the photogenerated electrons react with the activated CO 2 molecules to form COO -intermediate species.Partial COO - recombine with protons to form COOH radials.Afterwards, COOH radials react with protons and photogenerated electrons to form H 2 O and CO.The rest of COO -intermediate radials undergo further reaction with protons to form HCOO -intermediate species.Subsequently, HCOO -further accepts protons and photogenerated electrons to form HCHO -species.Subsequently, HCHO -species can be further converted into CH 3 O -intermediate species by reacting with the protons and photogenerated electrons.Finally, CH 3 OH and CH 4 are generated.Therefore, the PCR conversion pathway over the surface of S-scheme TiO 2 ZnIn 2 S 4 CSHS follows the formaldehyde pathway. 2,3,58,69"
