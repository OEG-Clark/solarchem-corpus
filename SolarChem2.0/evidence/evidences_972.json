The morphologies and structure of different samples were also investigated, as shown in Figs. 2 andS2.The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the support TS-1 illustrates uniform nanoparticle of 300-400 nm, as shown in Fig. S2a.After ion-exchange, TiO 2 nanoparticles are loaded on the zeolite TS-1, as shown in Fig. S2b.Moreover, the uniformly dispersed Ag nanoparticles can be observed on the sample Ag/TS-1 by in-situ photodeposition methods (Fig. S2c, marked with yellow circles).Further, the morphologies and structure of the sample Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1 are also detailed investigated by SEM, HAADF and TEM.It is found that the morphology of TS-1 is well maintained after loading Ag and TiO 2 species, and no obvious aggregates can be observed on the sample Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1(Fig.2).The HRTEM images of Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1 show the highly crystalline zeolite framework with obvious lattice fringes, and the lattice spaces are about 1.113 nm and 0.385 nm, which is matched well with the (101) and ( 431) planes of zeolite TS-1, respectively (Fig. 2c andd).Besides, the TiO 2 nanoparticles have been uniformly dispersed on the zeolite, and the measured lattice space of TiO 2 is about 0.354 nm (Fig. 2d-f), corresponding to the (101) plane of anatase TiO 2 , indicating that the sample Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1 has a highly exposed 101 planes of TiO 2 .Moreover, it is worth mentioning that the Ag nanoparticles with particle size less than 10 nm are uniformly distributed on the support TS-1, and the lattice space is about 0.236 nm, which can match with the (111) plane of Ag.The SEM image and the corresponding element mapping images further reveal the uniformly dispersed Ag and Ti species throughout zeolite TS-1 (Fig. 3a-f).Such small and uniform Ag nanoparticles are the key to improve the photocatalytic activity. The adsorption and transport of reactant on the catalyst are also crucial to accelerate the photoconversion of CO 2 , thus the surface area and pore size distribution of the samples are studied, as shown in Fig. 4a andb, and the corresponding pore structure parameters are listed in Table 1.All presented samples exhibit typical type I and IV isotherms, indicating the existence of microporous and mesoporous structure, respectively.The support TS-1 shows a higher BET surface area (327 m 2 g -1 ) and a larger pore volume (0.26 cm 3 g -1 ).After modifying Ag or/ and TiO 2 , the obtained samples TiO 2 /TS-1, Ag/TS-1 and Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1 still show higher BET surface area and larger pore volume, i.e., the BET surface area and the pore volume of the sample Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1 are as high as 242 m 2 g -1 and 0.22 cm 3 g -1 , respectively.Besides, it is also found that the sample Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1 shows a hierarchically mesoporous structure, and the average pore size is about 3.3 nm.The larger BET surface area and wide pore size distribution of the sample Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1 not only offer an access for the diffusion and transport of reactants and products, but also is conductive to expose more active sites for the adsorption of reactant. UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of the samples TS-1, TiO 2 /TS-1, Ag/TS-1 and Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1 are analyzed to investigate the optical adsorption properties, as shown in Fig. 5a.The pure zeolite TS-1 shows a typical absorption band in the range of UV light, which is related to the formed tetrahedrally coordinated Ti atoms or extra framework titanium species.The absorption band edge of the sample TiO 2 /TS-1 is about 330 nm.Compared to the sample TiO 2 /TS-1, the samples Ag/TS-1 and Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1 not only exhibit an obvious red shift of the adsorption edge, but also show additional visible light adsorption performance in 400-800 nm, which is related to the localized surface plasmon resonance (LPSR) of Ag nanoparticles.This result indicates that the deposition of Ag nanoparticles on the zeolite TS-1 can enhance the visible light utilization, which will potentially improve the photocatalytic activity of CO 2 reduction.In order to study the recombination efficiency of photoexcited electron-hole, photoluminescence spectra (PL) analyses of all samples have been carried out, as shown in Fig. 5b.It is found that although all samples show similar emission peaks, the peak intensity of the sample Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1 is lower than that of TiO 2 /TS-1 and Ag/TS-1.This result suggests that the photogenerated electrons and holes can be efficiently separated on the surface of the sample Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1, thus the sample Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1 has the low recombination rate of the photogenerated charges, which can be attributed to the presence of Ti 3 -V O defects and the synergetic effect between Ag and TiO 2 nanoparticles. The chemical states of O, Ti, Si and Ag for the samples TiO 2 /TS-1 and Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1 are also investigated by XPS analysis, as displayed in 6a).The highresolution XPS spectrum of Ag 3d shows two peaks of Ag 3d 5/2 and Ag 3d 3/2 at 367.8 and 373.8 eV, respectively, which could be ascribed to metal Ag (Fig. 6b), besides, the doublet separation degree of Ag 3d is about 6.0 eV, further indicating that the existence of metal Ag (Wang et al., 2020).The Si 2p XPS spectra of the samples TiO 2 /TS-1 and Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1 only shows a peak at 103.9 eV related to the Si-O species (Chao et al., 2011), as shown in Fig. 6c.The O 1s spectrum can be deconvoluted into two peaks at 530.1 eV and 533.0 eV (Fig. 6d), which are assigned to lattice oxygen (O L ) and chemical adsorbed oxygen (O C ), respectively (Hu et al., 2018).The existence of O C could be related to the oxygen vacancies deficient regions.It is noted that the content of O C on the sample Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1 (66.8) is higher than the sample TiO 2 /TS-1 (64.9), indicating that there are more oxygen vacancies presented in the ample Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1.As shown in Fig. 5e, the Ti2p XPS spectra of the samples TiO 2 /TS-1 and Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1 show two distinctive characteristic peaks at 458.8 eV and 464.5 eV, which can be corresponded to the Ti 2p 3/2 and Ti 2p 1/2 , respectively, indicating the existence of TiO 2 species (Qiang et al., 2020).Additionally, the Ti2p XPS spectrum of the sample Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1 is different from that of the sample TiO 2 /TS-1, and the peaks at 462.4 eV and 456.8 eV corresponding to Ti 3 species can be observed on the sample Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1, according to the Ti standard spectrum diagram (Ti 3 : 462.0 eV and 456.8 eV) and related reports (Abdullah et al., 2018), indicating the photodeposition method will induce the formation of Ti 3 species.This is because part of Ti 4 could be reduced by photogenerated electrons, leading to the generation of the Ti 3 species and oxygen vacancies. The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) of the samples TiO 2 /TS-1 and Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1 was carried out to prove the existence of oxygen vacancy.The single-featured EPR spectra for two samples have been observed at g 2.004 (Fig. 6f), which could be ascribed to the unpaired electrons trapped on oxygen vacancies.Besides, Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1 exhibits a stronger EPR signal than TiO 2 /TS-1, indicating that there are more oxygen vacancies presented in the sample o Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1, which is consistent with the results of XPS.It is reported that the existence of oxygen vacancies on the sample can not only enhance light harvesting and photogenerated charges separation, but also act as active sites for the CO 2 adsorption (Yang et al., 2019), which is proved by the results of UV-vis (Fig. 5a), PL (Fig. 5b) and CO 2 -TPD (Fig. S3) Therefore, the presence of rich oxygen vacancies of the sample Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1 is very helpful for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction. The temperature programmed desorption of CO 2 (CO 2 -TPD) was carried out to investigate the adsorption capacity of CO 2 on the catalysts, as shown in Fig. S3.All samples show CO 2 adsorption capacity due to the typical microporous channels of zeolite TS-1.Besides, it is found that Ag or/and TiO 2 loaded zeolite TS-1 exhibit a super CO 2 adsorption performance compared to pure zeolite TS-1, especially, the CO 2 adsorption capacity of the sample Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1 is the highest among presented samples.Therefore, we can conclude that the presence of Ti 3 -V O defects and the synergetic effect between Ag and TiO 2 is responsible for enhancing the CO 2 adsorption capacity. The surface light current response curves of different samples are shown in Fig. 7a.Pure zeolite TS-1 has almost no photocurrent response, while both TiO 2 /TS-1 and Ag/TS-1 samples display a sensitive photocurrent response under UV-vis light irradiation, suggestive of the super photocatalytic activity.Especially, the sample Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1 shows much super light current response performance and the photocurrent density is about 2 and 1.7 times than those of TiO 2 /TS-1 and Ag/TS-1, respectively.The above results indicate that the photogenerated charges can be effectively separated on the interface between TiO 2 and Ag, and thus the lifetime of photogenerated electrons can be prolonged on the sample Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1, which greatly improves its photocatalytic activity. We investigate the photocatalytic activities of CO 2 reduction over all prepared samples under UV-vis light irradiation, as shown in Fig. 7b andc.For the pure zeolite TS-1, there is little photocatalytic activity.However, the active species loaded zeolite, such as TiO 2 /TS-1, Ag/TS-1 and Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1, shows the photocatalytic activity of CO 2 reduction.Notably, only CO and CH 4 as reduction products can be detected on the sample Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1, while H 2 as byproducts can be not observed.This is probably because the catalyst modifying Ag nanoparticles has rich defects and provides a driving force that overcomes the energy barrier of CO 2 reduction to CO/CH 4 rather than the energy barrier of H 2 evolution, similar to previous report (Tan et al., 2019).It is found that the CO production rates are reaching up to 3.11, 4.41, 8.10 mol g -1 on the sample TiO 2 /TS-1, Ag/TS-1 and Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1 in 1 h, respectively.It is The pore structure parameters and Ti and Ag contents of the synthesized samples TS-1, TiO 2 /TS-1, Ag/TS-1 and Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1. S total (m 2 g -1) D average noted that the CO yield on the sample Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1 basically reaches the equilibrium after 2 h, which can be related to photocorrosion, nevertheless, the average CO production rate is still as high as 3.16 mol g -1 h -1 in 4 h, which is not only higher than that of TiO 2 /TS-1 and Ag/TS-1, but also much better than previous reports (Zheng et al., 2019).Besides, the samples Ag/TS-1 and Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1 can also photocatalytic convert CO 2 into CH 4 , such as, the CH 4 yield can reach up to 1.74 mol g -1 in 1 h and the average CH 4 yield is 0.47 mol g -1 h -1 in 4 h for the sample Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1, as shown in Fig. 7c.The CO and CH 4 yields reach 6.8 mol h -1 and 1.2 mol h -1 at 420 nm on the best sample Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1, corresponding to the quantum efficiency (QE) of 1.1.Besides, the influence of Ti and Ag contents in the sample Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1 on the photoactinic activity has been investigated, and the results are shown in Fig. 7d ande.It is found that the CO and CH 4 yields increase with the increase of Ti content, and the sample Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1 with 20.0 wt Ti shows the best catalytic activity toward CO 2 reduction.However, the catalytic activity decreases on the sample Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1 with 30.0 wt Ti species (Fig. 7d), possibly because some of the active sites are covered by excess TiO 2 .Moreover, the content of Ag nanoparticles also has a significant effect on the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, especially the yield of CH 4 , as shown in Fig. 7e.It is found that only 6.8 mol g -1 CO and 0.42 mol g -1 CH 4 can be obtained on the sample Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1 with 0.5 wt Ag in 1 h, and the yields of CO and CH 4 reach up to 8.1 mol g -1 and 1.74 mol g -1 on the sample Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1 with 1.0 wt Ag, respectively.However, the change of the yields of CO and CH 4 is very minor when the Ag content increases from 1.0 to 2.0 wt.In addition, the distribution of CO 2 reduction product over samples varies with the active species, as shown in Fig. 7f.It is interesting to find that for the sample TiO 2 /TS-1, the CO is only reduction product, while for the Ag species loaded zeolite TS-1, CO and CH 4 as reduction product can be detected.This indicates that the TiO 2 species can tend to bond intermediate CO , whereas Ag active sites is most favorably adsorbed CH 4 .In addition, previous studies have proved that the 101 plane of TiO 2 is reduction sites while the 001 plane is oxidation sites (Zheng et al., 2019).In our work, the sample Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1 has the highly exposed 101 plane of TiO 2 (Figs. 1 and2), indicating that there are more reduction sites for CO 2 conversion.Therefore, the sample Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1 shows super photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity with high yields of CO and CH 4 , which can be ascribed to the exposed 101 plane of TiO 2 and highly dispersed Ag nanoparticles.In order to confirm the stability of the sample Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1, the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction is circularly performed for three times and the results are shown in Fig. 7e.After each cycle, the reactor was purged with high-purity N 2 for 30 min and then CO 2 for 30 min to restart the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction.It is found that the sample Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1 still keeps high CO and CH 4 yields after three cycles under UV-vis light irradiation, suggestive of its excellent recyclability and stability. Based on the above results and discussion, a possible photocatalytic CO 2 reduction mechanism is proposed on the sample Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1, as shown in Scheme 1.Under UV-vis light irradiation, TiO 2 as semiconductor is excited to produce the photogenerated electrons and holes (route A).Next, the photogenerated electrons and holes can be separates efficiently via two routes (Step I): 1) the support zeolite TS-1 with Ti 3 -Vo defects can also capture photogenerated holes to realize the separation of photogenerated charges; 2) Ag nanoparticles on the support can rapidly capture photogenerated electrons from the TiO 2 .In the process of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, the highly exposed planes 101 planes of TiO 2 and Ag nanoparticles as active sites also reduce CO 2 into CO or CH 4 (Step II).In the photocatalytic CO 2 conversion, Ag acts as a cocatalyst not only improve the visible light absorption performance and photoelectric properties, but also induce the efficient separation of photogenerated electrons and holes.More importantly, more hot electrons are generated in metal Ag due to SPR effect (route B).Next, the hot plasmonic electrons in Ag nanoparticles can transfer to the TiO 2 nanoparticles or even are trapped by Ag, These electrons on the TiO 2 and Ag nanoparticles further react with CO 2 to produce CO or CH 4 under photoreduction reaction.The sample Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1 shows super performance of CO 2 reduction activity compared with the sample TiO 2 / TS-1, further confirming the relationship between hot electrons and CO 2 reduction activity.Therefore, the synergetic effects among Ag, TS-1 and TiO 2 , jointly enhance photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity."}, {"llm generation": "Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1", "source": "As expected, the obtained sample Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1 exhibits much excellent and stable photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance, giving a high production rate of 3.16 mol g -1 h -1 for CO and 0.47 mol g -1 h -1 for CH 4 under UV-vis light irradiation, especially, the production rate of CO and CH 4 is nearly unchanged after three cycles.", "context": "The TiO 2 species and Ag nanoparticles are loaded on zeolite TS-1 by an ion-exchange and subsequently in-situ photodeposition methods.As expected, the obtained sample Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1 exhibits much excellent and stable photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance, giving a high production rate of 3.16 mol g -1 h -1 for CO and 0.47 mol g -1 h -1 for CH 4 under UV-vis light irradiation, especially, the production rate of CO and CH 4 is nearly unchanged after three cycles.The super photocatalytic activity can be attributed to the jointed effect of the support zeolite, highly exposed reduction planes 101 of TiO 2 and uniformly dispersed Ag nanoparticles.The support with larger surface area and rich defects plays an important role in dispersing the active species and adsorbing CO 2 molecular as well as accelerating the separation of photogenerated charges by hole-electron traps.The highly exposed planes 101 of TiO 2 as reduction sites can accelerate the conversion of CO 2 .The highly dispersed Ag nanoparticles, as a cocatalyst, not only can significantly improve the CO 2 adsorption performance and the separation efficiency of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, but also can produce hot electrons for CO 2 reduction.The synergetic effects among Ag, TS-1 and TiO 2 , jointly improve CO 2 adsorption performance and the separation efficiency of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, which makes it show enhanced photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity.

The morphologies and structure of different samples were also investigated, as shown in Figs. 2 andS2.The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the support TS-1 illustrates uniform nanoparticle of 300-400 nm, as shown in Fig. S2a.After ion-exchange, TiO 2 nanoparticles are loaded on the zeolite TS-1, as shown in Fig. S2b.Moreover, the uniformly dispersed Ag nanoparticles can be observed on the sample Ag/TS-1 by in-situ photodeposition methods (Fig. S2c, marked with yellow circles).Further, the morphologies and structure of the sample Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1 are also detailed investigated by SEM, HAADF and TEM.It is found that the morphology of TS-1 is well maintained after loading Ag and TiO 2 species, and no obvious aggregates can be observed on the sample Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1(Fig.2).The HRTEM images of Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1 show the highly crystalline zeolite framework with obvious lattice fringes, and the lattice spaces are about 1.113 nm and 0.385 nm, which is matched well with the (101) and ( 431) planes of zeolite TS-1, respectively (Fig. 2c andd).Besides, the TiO 2 nanoparticles have been uniformly dispersed on the zeolite, and the measured lattice space of TiO 2 is about 0.354 nm (Fig. 2d-f), corresponding to the (101) plane of anatase TiO 2 , indicating that the sample Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1 has a highly exposed 101 planes of TiO 2 .Moreover, it is worth mentioning that the Ag nanoparticles with particle size less than 10 nm are uniformly distributed on the support TS-1, and the lattice space is about 0.236 nm, which can match with the (111) plane of Ag.The SEM image and the corresponding element mapping images further reveal the uniformly dispersed Ag and Ti species throughout zeolite TS-1 (Fig. 3a-f).Such small and uniform Ag nanoparticles are the key to improve the photocatalytic activity. The adsorption and transport of reactant on the catalyst are also crucial to accelerate the photoconversion of CO 2 , thus the surface area and pore size distribution of the samples are studied, as shown in Fig. 4a andb, and the corresponding pore structure parameters are listed in Table 1.All presented samples exhibit typical type I and IV isotherms, indicating the existence of microporous and mesoporous structure, respectively.The support TS-1 shows a higher BET surface area (327 m 2 g -1 ) and a larger pore volume (0.26 cm 3 g -1 ).After modifying Ag or/ and TiO 2 , the obtained samples TiO 2 /TS-1, Ag/TS-1 and Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1 still show higher BET surface area and larger pore volume, i.e., the BET surface area and the pore volume of the sample Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1 are as high as 242 m 2 g -1 and 0.22 cm 3 g -1 , respectively.Besides, it is also found that the sample Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1 shows a hierarchically mesoporous structure, and the average pore size is about 3.3 nm.The larger BET surface area and wide pore size distribution of the sample Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1 not only offer an access for the diffusion and transport of reactants and products, but also is conductive to expose more active sites for the adsorption of reactant. UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of the samples TS-1, TiO 2 /TS-1, Ag/TS-1 and Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1 are analyzed to investigate the optical adsorption properties, as shown in Fig. 5a.The pure zeolite TS-1 shows a typical absorption band in the range of UV light, which is related to the formed tetrahedrally coordinated Ti atoms or extra framework titanium species.The absorption band edge of the sample TiO 2 /TS-1 is about 330 nm.Compared to the sample TiO 2 /TS-1, the samples Ag/TS-1 and Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1 not only exhibit an obvious red shift of the adsorption edge, but also show additional visible light adsorption performance in 400-800 nm, which is related to the localized surface plasmon resonance (LPSR) of Ag nanoparticles.This result indicates that the deposition of Ag nanoparticles on the zeolite TS-1 can enhance the visible light utilization, which will potentially improve the photocatalytic activity of CO 2 reduction.In order to study the recombination efficiency of photoexcited electron-hole, photoluminescence spectra (PL) analyses of all samples have been carried out, as shown in Fig. 5b.It is found that although all samples show similar emission peaks, the peak intensity of the sample Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1 is lower than that of TiO 2 /TS-1 and Ag/TS-1.This result suggests that the photogenerated electrons and holes can be efficiently separated on the surface of the sample Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1, thus the sample Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1 has the low recombination rate of the photogenerated charges, which can be attributed to the presence of Ti 3 -V O defects and the synergetic effect between Ag and TiO 2 nanoparticles. The chemical states of O, Ti, Si and Ag for the samples TiO 2 /TS-1 and Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1 are also investigated by XPS analysis, as displayed in 6a).The highresolution XPS spectrum of Ag 3d shows two peaks of Ag 3d 5/2 and Ag 3d 3/2 at 367.8 and 373.8 eV, respectively, which could be ascribed to metal Ag (Fig. 6b), besides, the doublet separation degree of Ag 3d is about 6.0 eV, further indicating that the existence of metal Ag (Wang et al., 2020).The Si 2p XPS spectra of the samples TiO 2 /TS-1 and Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1 only shows a peak at 103.9 eV related to the Si-O species (Chao et al., 2011), as shown in Fig. 6c.The O 1s spectrum can be deconvoluted into two peaks at 530.1 eV and 533.0 eV (Fig. 6d), which are assigned to lattice oxygen (O L ) and chemical adsorbed oxygen (O C ), respectively (Hu et al., 2018).The existence of O C could be related to the oxygen vacancies deficient regions.It is noted that the content of O C on the sample Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1 (66.8) is higher than the sample TiO 2 /TS-1 (64.9), indicating that there are more oxygen vacancies presented in the ample Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1.As shown in Fig. 5e, the Ti2p XPS spectra of the samples TiO 2 /TS-1 and Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1 show two distinctive characteristic peaks at 458.8 eV and 464.5 eV, which can be corresponded to the Ti 2p 3/2 and Ti 2p 1/2 , respectively, indicating the existence of TiO 2 species (Qiang et al., 2020).Additionally, the Ti2p XPS spectrum of the sample Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1 is different from that of the sample TiO 2 /TS-1, and the peaks at 462.4 eV and 456.8 eV corresponding to Ti 3 species can be observed on the sample Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1, according to the Ti standard spectrum diagram (Ti 3 : 462.0 eV and 456.8 eV) and related reports (Abdullah et al., 2018), indicating the photodeposition method will induce the formation of Ti 3 species.This is because part of Ti 4 could be reduced by photogenerated electrons, leading to the generation of the Ti 3 species and oxygen vacancies. The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) of the samples TiO 2 /TS-1 and Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1 was carried out to prove the existence of oxygen vacancy.The single-featured EPR spectra for two samples have been observed at g 2.004 (Fig. 6f), which could be ascribed to the unpaired electrons trapped on oxygen vacancies.Besides, Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1 exhibits a stronger EPR signal than TiO 2 /TS-1, indicating that there are more oxygen vacancies presented in the sample o Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1, which is consistent with the results of XPS.It is reported that the existence of oxygen vacancies on the sample can not only enhance light harvesting and photogenerated charges separation, but also act as active sites for the CO 2 adsorption (Yang et al., 2019), which is proved by the results of UV-vis (Fig. 5a), PL (Fig. 5b) and CO 2 -TPD (Fig. S3) Therefore, the presence of rich oxygen vacancies of the sample Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1 is very helpful for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction. The temperature programmed desorption of CO 2 (CO 2 -TPD) was carried out to investigate the adsorption capacity of CO 2 on the catalysts, as shown in Fig. S3.All samples show CO 2 adsorption capacity due to the typical microporous channels of zeolite TS-1.Besides, it is found that Ag or/and TiO 2 loaded zeolite TS-1 exhibit a super CO 2 adsorption performance compared to pure zeolite TS-1, especially, the CO 2 adsorption capacity of the sample Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1 is the highest among presented samples.Therefore, we can conclude that the presence of Ti 3 -V O defects and the synergetic effect between Ag and TiO 2 is responsible for enhancing the CO 2 adsorption capacity. The surface light current response curves of different samples are shown in Fig. 7a.Pure zeolite TS-1 has almost no photocurrent response, while both TiO 2 /TS-1 and Ag/TS-1 samples display a sensitive photocurrent response under UV-vis light irradiation, suggestive of the super photocatalytic activity.Especially, the sample Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1 shows much super light current response performance and the photocurrent density is about 2 and 1.7 times than those of TiO 2 /TS-1 and Ag/TS-1, respectively.The above results indicate that the photogenerated charges can be effectively separated on the interface between TiO 2 and Ag, and thus the lifetime of photogenerated electrons can be prolonged on the sample Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1, which greatly improves its photocatalytic activity. We investigate the photocatalytic activities of CO 2 reduction over all prepared samples under UV-vis light irradiation, as shown in Fig. 7b andc.For the pure zeolite TS-1, there is little photocatalytic activity.However, the active species loaded zeolite, such as TiO 2 /TS-1, Ag/TS-1 and Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1, shows the photocatalytic activity of CO 2 reduction.Notably, only CO and CH 4 as reduction products can be detected on the sample Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1, while H 2 as byproducts can be not observed.This is probably because the catalyst modifying Ag nanoparticles has rich defects and provides a driving force that overcomes the energy barrier of CO 2 reduction to CO/CH 4 rather than the energy barrier of H 2 evolution, similar to previous report (Tan et al., 2019).It is found that the CO production rates are reaching up to 3.11, 4.41, 8.10 mol g -1 on the sample TiO 2 /TS-1, Ag/TS-1 and Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1 in 1 h, respectively.It is The pore structure parameters and Ti and Ag contents of the synthesized samples TS-1, TiO 2 /TS-1, Ag/TS-1 and Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1. S total (m 2 g -1) D average noted that the CO yield on the sample Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1 basically reaches the equilibrium after 2 h, which can be related to photocorrosion, nevertheless, the average CO production rate is still as high as 3.16 mol g -1 h -1 in 4 h, which is not only higher than that of TiO 2 /TS-1 and Ag/TS-1, but also much better than previous reports (Zheng et al., 2019).Besides, the samples Ag/TS-1 and Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1 can also photocatalytic convert CO 2 into CH 4 , such as, the CH 4 yield can reach up to 1.74 mol g -1 in 1 h and the average CH 4 yield is 0.47 mol g -1 h -1 in 4 h for the sample Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1, as shown in Fig. 7c.The CO and CH 4 yields reach 6.8 mol h -1 and 1.2 mol h -1 at 420 nm on the best sample Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1, corresponding to the quantum efficiency (QE) of 1.1.Besides, the influence of Ti and Ag contents in the sample Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1 on the photoactinic activity has been investigated, and the results are shown in Fig. 7d ande.It is found that the CO and CH 4 yields increase with the increase of Ti content, and the sample Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1 with 20.0 wt Ti shows the best catalytic activity toward CO 2 reduction.However, the catalytic activity decreases on the sample Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1 with 30.0 wt Ti species (Fig. 7d), possibly because some of the active sites are covered by excess TiO 2 .Moreover, the content of Ag nanoparticles also has a significant effect on the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, especially the yield of CH 4 , as shown in Fig. 7e.It is found that only 6.8 mol g -1 CO and 0.42 mol g -1 CH 4 can be obtained on the sample Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1 with 0.5 wt Ag in 1 h, and the yields of CO and CH 4 reach up to 8.1 mol g -1 and 1.74 mol g -1 on the sample Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1 with 1.0 wt Ag, respectively.However, the change of the yields of CO and CH 4 is very minor when the Ag content increases from 1.0 to 2.0 wt.In addition, the distribution of CO 2 reduction product over samples varies with the active species, as shown in Fig. 7f.It is interesting to find that for the sample TiO 2 /TS-1, the CO is only reduction product, while for the Ag species loaded zeolite TS-1, CO and CH 4 as reduction product can be detected.This indicates that the TiO 2 species can tend to bond intermediate CO , whereas Ag active sites is most favorably adsorbed CH 4 .In addition, previous studies have proved that the 101 plane of TiO 2 is reduction sites while the 001 plane is oxidation sites (Zheng et al., 2019).In our work, the sample Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1 has the highly exposed 101 plane of TiO 2 (Figs. 1 and2), indicating that there are more reduction sites for CO 2 conversion.Therefore, the sample Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1 shows super photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity with high yields of CO and CH 4 , which can be ascribed to the exposed 101 plane of TiO 2 and highly dispersed Ag nanoparticles.In order to confirm the stability of the sample Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1, the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction is circularly performed for three times and the results are shown in Fig. 7e.After each cycle, the reactor was purged with high-purity N 2 for 30 min and then CO 2 for 30 min to restart the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction.It is found that the sample Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1 still keeps high CO and CH 4 yields after three cycles under UV-vis light irradiation, suggestive of its excellent recyclability and stability. Based on the above results and discussion, a possible photocatalytic CO 2 reduction mechanism is proposed on the sample Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1, as shown in Scheme 1.Under UV-vis light irradiation, TiO 2 as semiconductor is excited to produce the photogenerated electrons and holes (route A).Next, the photogenerated electrons and holes can be separates efficiently via two routes (Step I): 1) the support zeolite TS-1 with Ti 3 -Vo defects can also capture photogenerated holes to realize the separation of photogenerated charges; 2) Ag nanoparticles on the support can rapidly capture photogenerated electrons from the TiO 2 .In the process of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, the highly exposed planes 101 planes of TiO 2 and Ag nanoparticles as active sites also reduce CO 2 into CO or CH 4 (Step II).In the photocatalytic CO 2 conversion, Ag acts as a cocatalyst not only improve the visible light absorption performance and photoelectric properties, but also induce the efficient separation of photogenerated electrons and holes.More importantly, more hot electrons are generated in metal Ag due to SPR effect (route B).Next, the hot plasmonic electrons in Ag nanoparticles can transfer to the TiO 2 nanoparticles or even are trapped by Ag, These electrons on the TiO 2 and Ag nanoparticles further react with CO 2 to produce CO or CH 4 under photoreduction reaction.The sample Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1 shows super performance of CO 2 reduction activity compared with the sample TiO 2 / TS-1, further confirming the relationship between hot electrons and CO 2 reduction activity.Therefore, the synergetic effects among Ag, TS-1 and TiO 2 , jointly enhance photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity."}, {"llm generation": "UV-Vis", "source": "As expected, the obtained sample Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1 exhibits much excellent and stable photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance, giving a high production rate of 3.16 mol g -1 h -1 for CO and 0.47 mol g -1 h -1 for CH 4 under UV-vis light irradiation, especially, the production rate of CO and CH 4 is nearly unchanged after three cycles.", "context": "The TiO 2 species and Ag nanoparticles are loaded on zeolite TS-1 by an ion-exchange and subsequently in-situ photodeposition methods.As expected, the obtained sample Ag-TiO 2 /TS-1 exhibits much excellent and stable photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance, giving a high production rate of 3.16 mol g -1 h -1 for CO and 0.47 mol g -1 h -1 for CH 4 under UV-vis light irradiation, especially, the production rate of CO and CH 4 is nearly unchanged after three cycles.The super photocatalytic activity can be attributed to the jointed effect of the support zeolite, highly exposed reduction planes 101 of TiO 2 and uniformly dispersed Ag nanoparticles.The support with larger surface area and rich defects plays an important role in dispersing the active species and adsorbing CO 2 molecular as well as accelerating the separation of photogenerated charges by hole-electron traps.The highly exposed planes 101 of TiO 2 as reduction sites can accelerate the conversion of CO 2 .The highly dispersed Ag nanoparticles, as a cocatalyst, not only can significantly improve the CO 2 adsorption performance and the separation efficiency of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, but also can produce hot electrons for CO 2 reduction.The synergetic effects among Ag, TS-1 and TiO 2 , jointly improve CO 2 adsorption performance and the separation efficiency of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, which makes it show enhanced photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity.

Zeolite TS-1 was prepared by a hydrothermal crystalline process.Typically, 0.08 g Na 2 CO 3 and 0.02 g KCl were dissolved into a mixture solution including 8 mL H 2 O and 12 g TPAOH.Subsequently, 50 mmol H 2 SiO 3 was slowly added into the above solution and stirred for 6 h at 40 C.Then, the mixed solution consisting of 2 mmol Ti(SO 4 ) 2 was also added into the above solution and vigorously stirred at 40 C for 4 h.Next, the resulting solution was transferred into a Teflon autoclave and treated at 160 C for 16 h.After, the solution was cooled to room temperature and washed three times with ethanol and distilled water.The final powder sample was collected after drying at 100 C overnight and calcination at 550 C for 4 h. 500 mg powder sample TS-1 was added into 20 mL Ti(SO 4 ) 2 aqueous solution with different concentration (0.1 M, 0.2 M and 0.3 M) and stirred at 80 C for 4 h, then the solution was washed three times with distilled water.Then, the sample was dried at 100 C overnight and calcined at 550 C for 4 h.The final sample TiO 2 /TS-1 with different Ti content can be obtained. 1 mL AgNO 3 aqueous solution (0.05 M, 0.1 M, 0.15 M and 0.2 M) was injected into the TiO 2 /TS-1 suspension aqueous solution (0.5 g, 100 mL) and stirred for 20 min, then the solution was irradiated for 30 min under UV light and CH 3 OH as sacrificial agent was added in to the mixed solution.After being filtered and washed by water and ethanol, the precipitate was freeze dried overnight and the final samples Ag-TiO 2 /TSwith different Ag contents were obtained. 50 mmol Ti(SO 4 ) 2 was added into 20 mL aqueous solution and stirred at 80 C for 4 h, then the solution was treated at 150 C for 16 h.After, the solution was washed several times with distilled water.The final powder sample was collected after drying at 100 C overnight and calcination at 550 C for 4 h. The wide-angle X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples were measured on a Rigaku D/Max 2200PC diffractometer with Cu K radiation (40 kV and 40 mA).The nitrogen sorption/desorption curves of the samples were tested on Micromeritics ASAP 3020, and the specific surface area and the pore size distribution were calculated using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) methods at -196 C, respectively.The morphologies and structure of samples were investigated by the Transmission Electron Microscopic (TEM, JEOL-2010 F operated at 200 kV) and Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FEI, Magellan 400) using an HAADF detector.The temperature-programed desorption with CO 2 (CO 2 -TPD) curves of the samples were conducted on Micrometrics Chemisorb 2750 instrument attached with ChemiSoft TPx software.The content of Ag was measured by using Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectroscopy analyzer (ICP-OES).X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) peaks of Si, Ti, Ag and O elements were measured on the ESCAlab 250Xi instrument with the C 1 s electron peak (BE 284.8eV) as internal reference.UV visible absorption spectrum (UV-vis) was obtained on the Shimadzu UV-2600 spectrometer, and BaSO 4 was selected as the reference sample.Photoluminescence spectra (PL) of the samples were analyzed on the Shimadzu RF-6000 spectrometer with the excitation wavelength of nm.The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra of the samples were measured on the Bruker EMXPLUS10/12 EPR electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometer equipped with a Quanta-Ray Nd:YAG laser system. The photocurrent tests were performed on the CHI 660A electrochemical workstation with three electrode system, and Na 2 SO 4 (0.5 M) was used as electrolyte.A 300 W Xe lamp was employed as the light source.Pt sheet and Ag/AgCl were the opposite electrode and reference electrode, respectively.For preparing the work electrode, 40 mg catalyst and 10 mg carbon were ground and then dispersed into the mixed solution including 1 mL ethanol, 0.5 mL water and 0.2 mL Nafion solution (5) by ultrasonic technique to obtain catalyst slurry.Next, 0.3 mL slurry was coated on FTO glass plate with an active area of 1 cm 2 , followed by drying at 100 C for 4 h. The process of photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 was examined in a Y. Sun et al. mL gas-closed system and the light source was a 300 W Xe lamp.Typically, 0.3 mL slurry was coated on FTO glass plate with an active area of 1 cm 2 .Prior to irradiation, the photoreaction system was purged with the high-purity N 2 for 30 min to remove air and then purged with CO 2 gas for 30 min.Next, 1 mL distilled water was injected into the photoreaction system and initiated the photocatalytic reaction.The reduction products were collected at given intervals (1 h) and determined by a gas chromatography (Thermo Scientific TRACE 1300) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a flame ionization detector (FID). The apparent quantum efficiency (QE) was measured under the same photocatalytic reaction condition with irradiation light at 420 nm by using 300 W Xe lamp, and the QE was calculated according to Eq.
