Assessing the bands edge positions of Cu2O and TiO2 and the band alignment is important to understand the electron transfer process at the heterojunction and to determine the reactions that are thermodynamically feasible.The combined information from DRUV, UPS and XPS spectroscopies was used to determine electronic band alignments and the construction of the band energy diagram as discussed below. DRUV spectra of Cu2O, pure TiO2, and Cu2O/TiO2 are shown in Fig. 4a.The absorption edges for pure Cu2O and TiO2 samples were approximately 600 and 390 nm, respectively.Analysis of Tauc plots indicates that the optical bandgaps are EBG (Cu2O) 2.03 eV, (as a direct semiconductor) and EBG (TiO2) 3.16 eV, (as an indirect semiconductor) 40 (Fig. S4).These figures agree with the previously reported values for Cu2O 41 and TiO2 10. Fig. 4b shows the UPS spectra of Cu2O, TiO2 and Cu2O/TiO2.By applying the method of linear approximation to the UPS spectra, the work function and the corresponding energy of the Fermi level of Cu2O were estimated to be 4.70 and -4.70 eV, respectively.Similarly, the valence band maximum was calculated to be -5.20 eV.Considering the average bandgap energy value (2.03 eV for Cu2O) obtained from the Tauc plots (Fig. S4, Supporting Information), the minimum of the conduction band is located at -3.17 eV.The quantities previously determined are referred to the vacuum level.Therefore, according to the relationship between the potential of the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE), E , and the energy of the vacuum (Eabs), Eabs -E -4.44 (at 298 K), the conduction and valence bands of Cu2O are poised at -1.27 and 0.76 eV, respectively.Similarly, following this procedure for TiO2, the estimated Fermi level (EF), CB and VB vs NHE are -0.38,-0.57and 2.59 eV, respectively (Figure S5, Supporting Information). After contact, the Fermi level of Cu2O and TiO2 equilibrates due to the formation of a p-n heterojunction at the interface of the Cu2O/TiO2 composite 42.This process alters the band positions, as observed by XPS. Figure S5 in the Supporting Information provides the XPS spectra. The band alignment at the interface of Cu2O/TiO2 was determined following the method of Kraut 43.To accurately determine the valence band offset, EVBO, the energy difference between the core level (ECL) and the valence band maximum (EVBM) in the pure materials, as well as the energy difference between the core levels at the interface of the heterostructure (E CL Int ) are needed.Eq. 2 and 3 are used to calculate EVBO and E CL Int , respectively: The conduction band offset, ECBO, can be readily obtained from the bandgap energies (EBG) of the pure materials and EVBO: Combining the information gathered during XPS and DRUV analyses reveals that for the nanocomposite EVBO 1.93 eV and ECBO 0.81 eV (Figure 5).The energy difference between the conduction and valence bands for the materials in the composite are about 0.11 eV higher than the values before contact.From the previous observation and the onset value of the composite (Figure 4b), the valence band maximum of Cu2O in the composite is calculated to lie at 0.62 eV (vs NHE).The last figure is useful to calculate the apparent bandgap of Cu2O in the composite, which together with EVBO and ECBO, is needed to estimate the minimum of the conduction band of Cu2O in the composite is -1.39 eV (vs NHE) and the valence band maximum and conduction band minimum of TiO2, which are depicted at 2.55 and -0.58 eV in Figure 5, respectively 20. Fig. 5 shows the energy diagram indicating the formation of a Type II (staggered) band heterostructure, whose highly energetic conduction band favors the reduction of CO2 through photogenerated electrons.We assume that the assignment of the composite bands corresponds to values that are far from the Cu2O/TiO2 interface.Taking into account this observation, and considering that the energy differences between CB and EF for TiO2 as well as from VB and EF for Cu2O do not remain constant before and after contact, we showed in Fig. 5 the associated band bendings 44,45,46. The energy difference between the valence band maximum of Cu 2 O and the conduction band minimum of TiO 2 can be estimated as 1.33 and 1.2 eV for the separated semiconductors and the composite, respectively.This change indicates that under UV-visible irradiation, the electron transfer from the conduction band of TiO 2 to the valence band of Cu 2 O (direct Z-Scheme) could be favored due to the increased overlap of energy levels involved upon p-n heterojunction formation. Irradiation of the composite with 305 nm results in the selective formation of CO, (and O 2 ).The time series for CO evolution from the irradiated composite is shown in Fig. 6 together with the results obtained under similar conditions for pure Cu 2 O and TiO 2 .Control experiments for Cu 2 O/TiO 2 showed that no CO evolved in the dark or when the irradiation was carried out in the absence of CO 2 under 1 atm argon (Fig. S6). It is apparent from the results in Fig. 6 that the formation of the p-n heterojunction improves the CO 2 reduction efficiency.Considering the same initial stage of irradiation, the CO evolution rates were calculated to be 2.11 and 0.55 mol g cat -1 h -1 for Cu 2 O/TiO 2 and Cu 2 O, respectively, which represents a ca. 4-times enhancement for the composite.The ratio from the areas for the convolution of the irradiance of the lamp with the DRUV spectra of 1) Cu 2 O/TiO 2 and 2) Cu 2 O in the interval 305 665 nm indicates the nanocomposite absorbs ca.2-times more photons than Cu 2 O per unit mass under the experimental conditions in Figure 6.Thus, only a 50 of the enhanced photocatalytic activity can be explained to arise from an increment in the oscillator strength (or the resulting increase of the integrated absorption per unit mass).Therefore, the synergistic effect from the materials in the nanocomposite is proposed to provide the remaining 50 photocatalytic enhancement. The ratio of quantum efficiencies for CO production, CO , for Cu 2 O/TiO 2 and Cu 2 O can be easily calculated from the established relationships between the initial reaction rates (R 0,CO ) and the absorbed photon fluxes I a , which was established in the response to the previous comment, Therefore, the relative quantum efficiencies in Eq (5) clearly demonstrate that Cu 2 O/TiO 2 has an enhanced photocatalytic activity over Cu 2 O. Another point of interest is that the evolution of CO decreases with the irradiation time.This is a characteristic of many photocatalytic process 10 and, in particular, has been observed for the The actual reason for this behavior is not well understood, and possible causes for the non-linear time profile are commonly ascribed to the strong interaction between Cu 2 O and CO, or the formation of O 2, which competes with carbon dioxide reduction 47.To get more insight, we investigate the rate of CO evolution in repeated 1 h irradiation cycles.After each run, the reactor was thoroughly evacuated and reloaded with the same amount of CO 2 and H 2 O before irradiation.Fig. 7 shows that after 4 cycles, CO yields slightly diminish, in sharp contrast with the results obtained under continuous irradiation.These experiments indicate that the inhibition observed in Fig. 6 is not irreversible, and the catalyst may be recycled without significant loss of efficiency, if the products are periodically removed. As The most relevant results are summarized in the Table 1, which details are provided in Fig. S7. XPS and XRD analysis allow us to discard the possible photoreduction of Cu(I) 30,46 and the TiO 2 holes localize on surface oxygen, forming (Ti 3 ) latt and (Ti 4 O -) surf para-magnetic species, respectively.By these processes, we achieved a heterostructure with strongly reductive electrons, the production rate of HO is 0.22 ( 0.03) mol g cat -1 h -1 .Comparatively, after 3 h of irradiation, the rate of production of CO is 5-times larger.By correcting the previous rates in a per photon basis using the stoichiometric consumptions of 2 e -CB and 1 h VB for CO and HO species produced, respectively, indicates that 40 of the theoretical amount of HO is trapped in 7-Hydroxycoumarin.The previous observation is not surprising for HO , a high reactivity and short lived species with a lifetime 1 ns 28. In the presence of CO 2 , additional evidence of water oxidation by Cu 2 O-TiO 2 nanostructures, comes from the analysis of the ratio between CO and O 2 yields.After 1 hr of irradiation, we determined CO/ mol g -1 cat 1.69 0.12 and O 2 / mol g -1 cat 0.83 0.06, which gives CO/O 2 1.69:0.83 2.03, in close agreement with the expected reaction stoichiometry. According to the Z-Scheme, the anodic reaction takes place in the Cu 2 O surface.In this regard, it is interesting to notice that the one electron homogeneous reduction potential for the monoelectronic reduction of CO 2 (Eq.( 1)), is more negative than the conduction band level of Cu 2 O (E CB (Cu 2 O) -1.39eV). Thus, in order to make the CO 2 reduction thermodynamically feasible, some stabilization must be invoked"}, {"llm generation": "Cu2O/TiO2", "source": "A Cu2O/TiO2 photocatalyst with high morphologic and crystallographic quality was synthetized by a simple solvothermal method.", "context": "A Cu2O/TiO2 photocatalyst with high morphologic and crystallographic quality was synthetized by a simple solvothermal method.The new material shows a 4-times enhancement for the photoreduction rate of CO2 induced by UV-visible irradiation in comparison to pure Cu2O.

Cu2O synthesis closely follows a previous published procedure 24.In a typical experiment, 6.66 g of PVP were dissolved in an aqueous solution of CuCl2.2H2O (0.01 mol L -1 , 100 mL) at 55 C.Then, 10.0 mL NaOH aqueous solution (2.0 mol L -1 ) was added dropwise into the above transparent light green solution.During this process, the solution color changes from blue-green to dark brown.The reaction mixture was stirred for 0.5 h, keeping the temperature at 55 C. Afterwards, 10 ml of an aqueous ascorbic acid solution (0.6 mol L -1 ) was added dropwise and the mixture was aged for 3 h under constant stirring and strict temperature control (55 C).This last stage gradually produces a red suspension.The resulting precipitate was collected by centrifugation and washed consecutively with 10 ml of deionized water and absolute ethanol (5 times).Finally, the solid was dried under vacuum at 60 C for 5 h for further use and characterization.

Assessing the bands edge positions of Cu2O and TiO2 and the band alignment is important to understand the electron transfer process at the heterojunction and to determine the reactions that are thermodynamically feasible.The combined information from DRUV, UPS and XPS spectroscopies was used to determine electronic band alignments and the construction of the band energy diagram as discussed below. DRUV spectra of Cu2O, pure TiO2, and Cu2O/TiO2 are shown in Fig. 4a.The absorption edges for pure Cu2O and TiO2 samples were approximately 600 and 390 nm, respectively.Analysis of Tauc plots indicates that the optical bandgaps are EBG (Cu2O) 2.03 eV, (as a direct semiconductor) and EBG (TiO2) 3.16 eV, (as an indirect semiconductor) 40 (Fig. S4).These figures agree with the previously reported values for Cu2O 41 and TiO2 10. Fig. 4b shows the UPS spectra of Cu2O, TiO2 and Cu2O/TiO2.By applying the method of linear approximation to the UPS spectra, the work function and the corresponding energy of the Fermi level of Cu2O were estimated to be 4.70 and -4.70 eV, respectively.Similarly, the valence band maximum was calculated to be -5.20 eV.Considering the average bandgap energy value (2.03 eV for Cu2O) obtained from the Tauc plots (Fig. S4, Supporting Information), the minimum of the conduction band is located at -3.17 eV.The quantities previously determined are referred to the vacuum level.Therefore, according to the relationship between the potential of the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE), E , and the energy of the vacuum (Eabs), Eabs -E -4.44 (at 298 K), the conduction and valence bands of Cu2O are poised at -1.27 and 0.76 eV, respectively.Similarly, following this procedure for TiO2, the estimated Fermi level (EF), CB and VB vs NHE are -0.38,-0.57and 2.59 eV, respectively (Figure S5, Supporting Information). After contact, the Fermi level of Cu2O and TiO2 equilibrates due to the formation of a p-n heterojunction at the interface of the Cu2O/TiO2 composite 42.This process alters the band positions, as observed by XPS. Figure S5 in the Supporting Information provides the XPS spectra. The band alignment at the interface of Cu2O/TiO2 was determined following the method of Kraut 43.To accurately determine the valence band offset, EVBO, the energy difference between the core level (ECL) and the valence band maximum (EVBM) in the pure materials, as well as the energy difference between the core levels at the interface of the heterostructure (E CL Int ) are needed.Eq. 2 and 3 are used to calculate EVBO and E CL Int , respectively: The conduction band offset, ECBO, can be readily obtained from the bandgap energies (EBG) of the pure materials and EVBO: Combining the information gathered during XPS and DRUV analyses reveals that for the nanocomposite EVBO 1.93 eV and ECBO 0.81 eV (Figure 5).The energy difference between the conduction and valence bands for the materials in the composite are about 0.11 eV higher than the values before contact.From the previous observation and the onset value of the composite (Figure 4b), the valence band maximum of Cu2O in the composite is calculated to lie at 0.62 eV (vs NHE).The last figure is useful to calculate the apparent bandgap of Cu2O in the composite, which together with EVBO and ECBO, is needed to estimate the minimum of the conduction band of Cu2O in the composite is -1.39 eV (vs NHE) and the valence band maximum and conduction band minimum of TiO2, which are depicted at 2.55 and -0.58 eV in Figure 5, respectively 20. Fig. 5 shows the energy diagram indicating the formation of a Type II (staggered) band heterostructure, whose highly energetic conduction band favors the reduction of CO2 through photogenerated electrons.We assume that the assignment of the composite bands corresponds to values that are far from the Cu2O/TiO2 interface.Taking into account this observation, and considering that the energy differences between CB and EF for TiO2 as well as from VB and EF for Cu2O do not remain constant before and after contact, we showed in Fig. 5 the associated band bendings 44,45,46. The energy difference between the valence band maximum of Cu 2 O and the conduction band minimum of TiO 2 can be estimated as 1.33 and 1.2 eV for the separated semiconductors and the composite, respectively.This change indicates that under UV-visible irradiation, the electron transfer from the conduction band of TiO 2 to the valence band of Cu 2 O (direct Z-Scheme) could be favored due to the increased overlap of energy levels involved upon p-n heterojunction formation. Irradiation of the composite with 305 nm results in the selective formation of CO, (and O 2 ).The time series for CO evolution from the irradiated composite is shown in Fig. 6 together with the results obtained under similar conditions for pure Cu 2 O and TiO 2 .Control experiments for Cu 2 O/TiO 2 showed that no CO evolved in the dark or when the irradiation was carried out in the absence of CO 2 under 1 atm argon (Fig. S6). It is apparent from the results in Fig. 6 that the formation of the p-n heterojunction improves the CO 2 reduction efficiency.Considering the same initial stage of irradiation, the CO evolution rates were calculated to be 2.11 and 0.55 mol g cat -1 h -1 for Cu 2 O/TiO 2 and Cu 2 O, respectively, which represents a ca. 4-times enhancement for the composite.The ratio from the areas for the convolution of the irradiance of the lamp with the DRUV spectra of 1) Cu 2 O/TiO 2 and 2) Cu 2 O in the interval 305 665 nm indicates the nanocomposite absorbs ca.2-times more photons than Cu 2 O per unit mass under the experimental conditions in Figure 6.Thus, only a 50 of the enhanced photocatalytic activity can be explained to arise from an increment in the oscillator strength (or the resulting increase of the integrated absorption per unit mass).Therefore, the synergistic effect from the materials in the nanocomposite is proposed to provide the remaining 50 photocatalytic enhancement. The ratio of quantum efficiencies for CO production, CO , for Cu 2 O/TiO 2 and Cu 2 O can be easily calculated from the established relationships between the initial reaction rates (R 0,CO ) and the absorbed photon fluxes I a , which was established in the response to the previous comment, Therefore, the relative quantum efficiencies in Eq (5) clearly demonstrate that Cu 2 O/TiO 2 has an enhanced photocatalytic activity over Cu 2 O. Another point of interest is that the evolution of CO decreases with the irradiation time.This is a characteristic of many photocatalytic process 10 and, in particular, has been observed for the The actual reason for this behavior is not well understood, and possible causes for the non-linear time profile are commonly ascribed to the strong interaction between Cu 2 O and CO, or the formation of O 2, which competes with carbon dioxide reduction 47.To get more insight, we investigate the rate of CO evolution in repeated 1 h irradiation cycles.After each run, the reactor was thoroughly evacuated and reloaded with the same amount of CO 2 and H 2 O before irradiation.Fig. 7 shows that after 4 cycles, CO yields slightly diminish, in sharp contrast with the results obtained under continuous irradiation.These experiments indicate that the inhibition observed in Fig. 6 is not irreversible, and the catalyst may be recycled without significant loss of efficiency, if the products are periodically removed. As The most relevant results are summarized in the Table 1, which details are provided in Fig. S7. XPS and XRD analysis allow us to discard the possible photoreduction of Cu(I) 30,46 and the TiO 2 holes localize on surface oxygen, forming (Ti 3 ) latt and (Ti 4 O -) surf para-magnetic species, respectively.By these processes, we achieved a heterostructure with strongly reductive electrons, the production rate of HO is 0.22 ( 0.03) mol g cat -1 h -1 .Comparatively, after 3 h of irradiation, the rate of production of CO is 5-times larger.By correcting the previous rates in a per photon basis using the stoichiometric consumptions of 2 e -CB and 1 h VB for CO and HO species produced, respectively, indicates that 40 of the theoretical amount of HO is trapped in 7-Hydroxycoumarin.The previous observation is not surprising for HO , a high reactivity and short lived species with a lifetime 1 ns 28. In the presence of CO 2 , additional evidence of water oxidation by Cu 2 O-TiO 2 nanostructures, comes from the analysis of the ratio between CO and O 2 yields.After 1 hr of irradiation, we determined CO/ mol g -1 cat 1.69 0.12 and O 2 / mol g -1 cat 0.83 0.06, which gives CO/O 2 1.69:0.83 2.03, in close agreement with the expected reaction stoichiometry. According to the Z-Scheme, the anodic reaction takes place in the Cu 2 O surface.In this regard, it is interesting to notice that the one electron homogeneous reduction potential for the monoelectronic reduction of CO 2 (Eq.( 1)), is more negative than the conduction band level of Cu 2 O (E CB (Cu 2 O) -1.39eV). Thus, in order to make the CO 2 reduction thermodynamically feasible, some stabilization must be invoked"}, {"llm generation": "UV-visible", "source": "The new material shows a 4-times enhancement for the photoreduction rate of CO2 induced by UV-visible irradiation in comparison to pure Cu2O.", "context": "A Cu2O/TiO2 photocatalyst with high morphologic and crystallographic quality was synthetized by a simple solvothermal method.The new material shows a 4-times enhancement for the photoreduction rate of CO2 induced by UV-visible irradiation in comparison to pure Cu2O.

By modi31ng the reaction conditions, i.e., the relative amount between the capping agent and Cu 2 O precursors, the shape of Cu 2 O crystals can be easily modified from cubic to octahedra.This issue has attracted the attention of many researchers, who concluded that octahedral Cu 2 O with exposed 111 facets exhibited much higher photocatalytic activity than the cubic structure29,30,31.It is apparent that crystalline 111 facets containing active Cu atoms can increase the interaction with donors and acceptors24,32.Guided by these conditions, we choose Cu 2 O octahedral as the starting point to design the composite33,34.Also, since the hybrid composite would allow free access of the acceptor and donor to both surfaces, we regulated the concentration of the semiconductors precursors taking into account the individual size and surface area in order to warrant nearly all of TiO 2 nanoparticles cover the surface of Cu 2 O and the amount of free TiO 2 nanoparticles is depreciable as verified by SEM analysis.The actual proportion in the composite was estimated by SEM-EDS analysis in 0.053:0.947 of TiO 2 :Cu 2 O in weight, in very good agreement with the nominal proportion (See Fig.S1). during the irradiation experiments for Cu 2 O and Cu 2 O/TiO 2 composite as no Cu(0) could be observed.On the other hand, as shown in Table 1, XPS analysis of pure Cu 2 O shows a relative increment of the contribution of Cu(II) in the Cu2p 3/2 in relation to the Cu(I) content.Cu 2 O photocorrosion might have been anticipated Summary of XPS analysis for Cu 2 O and Cu 2 O/TiO 2 photocatalysts at different irradiation times.

Assessing the bands edge positions of Cu2O and TiO2 and the band alignment is important to understand the electron transfer process at the heterojunction and to determine the reactions that are thermodynamically feasible.The combined information from DRUV, UPS and XPS spectroscopies was used to determine electronic band alignments and the construction of the band energy diagram as discussed below. DRUV spectra of Cu2O, pure TiO2, and Cu2O/TiO2 are shown in Fig. 4a.The absorption edges for pure Cu2O and TiO2 samples were approximately 600 and 390 nm, respectively.Analysis of Tauc plots indicates that the optical bandgaps are EBG (Cu2O) 2.03 eV, (as a direct semiconductor) and EBG (TiO2) 3.16 eV, (as an indirect semiconductor) 40 (Fig. S4).These figures agree with the previously reported values for Cu2O 41 and TiO2 10. Fig. 4b shows the UPS spectra of Cu2O, TiO2 and Cu2O/TiO2.By applying the method of linear approximation to the UPS spectra, the work function and the corresponding energy of the Fermi level of Cu2O were estimated to be 4.70 and -4.70 eV, respectively.Similarly, the valence band maximum was calculated to be -5.20 eV.Considering the average bandgap energy value (2.03 eV for Cu2O) obtained from the Tauc plots (Fig. S4, Supporting Information), the minimum of the conduction band is located at -3.17 eV.The quantities previously determined are referred to the vacuum level.Therefore, according to the relationship between the potential of the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE), E , and the energy of the vacuum (Eabs), Eabs -E -4.44 (at 298 K), the conduction and valence bands of Cu2O are poised at -1.27 and 0.76 eV, respectively.Similarly, following this procedure for TiO2, the estimated Fermi level (EF), CB and VB vs NHE are -0.38,-0.57and 2.59 eV, respectively (Figure S5, Supporting Information). After contact, the Fermi level of Cu2O and TiO2 equilibrates due to the formation of a p-n heterojunction at the interface of the Cu2O/TiO2 composite 42.This process alters the band positions, as observed by XPS. Figure S5 in the Supporting Information provides the XPS spectra. The band alignment at the interface of Cu2O/TiO2 was determined following the method of Kraut 43.To accurately determine the valence band offset, EVBO, the energy difference between the core level (ECL) and the valence band maximum (EVBM) in the pure materials, as well as the energy difference between the core levels at the interface of the heterostructure (E CL Int ) are needed.Eq. 2 and 3 are used to calculate EVBO and E CL Int , respectively: The conduction band offset, ECBO, can be readily obtained from the bandgap energies (EBG) of the pure materials and EVBO: Combining the information gathered during XPS and DRUV analyses reveals that for the nanocomposite EVBO 1.93 eV and ECBO 0.81 eV (Figure 5).The energy difference between the conduction and valence bands for the materials in the composite are about 0.11 eV higher than the values before contact.From the previous observation and the onset value of the composite (Figure 4b), the valence band maximum of Cu2O in the composite is calculated to lie at 0.62 eV (vs NHE).The last figure is useful to calculate the apparent bandgap of Cu2O in the composite, which together with EVBO and ECBO, is needed to estimate the minimum of the conduction band of Cu2O in the composite is -1.39 eV (vs NHE) and the valence band maximum and conduction band minimum of TiO2, which are depicted at 2.55 and -0.58 eV in Figure 5, respectively 20. Fig. 5 shows the energy diagram indicating the formation of a Type II (staggered) band heterostructure, whose highly energetic conduction band favors the reduction of CO2 through photogenerated electrons.We assume that the assignment of the composite bands corresponds to values that are far from the Cu2O/TiO2 interface.Taking into account this observation, and considering that the energy differences between CB and EF for TiO2 as well as from VB and EF for Cu2O do not remain constant before and after contact, we showed in Fig. 5 the associated band bendings 44,45,46. The energy difference between the valence band maximum of Cu 2 O and the conduction band minimum of TiO 2 can be estimated as 1.33 and 1.2 eV for the separated semiconductors and the composite, respectively.This change indicates that under UV-visible irradiation, the electron transfer from the conduction band of TiO 2 to the valence band of Cu 2 O (direct Z-Scheme) could be favored due to the increased overlap of energy levels involved upon p-n heterojunction formation. Irradiation of the composite with 305 nm results in the selective formation of CO, (and O 2 ).The time series for CO evolution from the irradiated composite is shown in Fig. 6 together with the results obtained under similar conditions for pure Cu 2 O and TiO 2 .Control experiments for Cu 2 O/TiO 2 showed that no CO evolved in the dark or when the irradiation was carried out in the absence of CO 2 under 1 atm argon (Fig. S6). It is apparent from the results in Fig. 6 that the formation of the p-n heterojunction improves the CO 2 reduction efficiency.Considering the same initial stage of irradiation, the CO evolution rates were calculated to be 2.11 and 0.55 mol g cat -1 h -1 for Cu 2 O/TiO 2 and Cu 2 O, respectively, which represents a ca. 4-times enhancement for the composite.The ratio from the areas for the convolution of the irradiance of the lamp with the DRUV spectra of 1) Cu 2 O/TiO 2 and 2) Cu 2 O in the interval 305 665 nm indicates the nanocomposite absorbs ca.2-times more photons than Cu 2 O per unit mass under the experimental conditions in Figure 6.Thus, only a 50 of the enhanced photocatalytic activity can be explained to arise from an increment in the oscillator strength (or the resulting increase of the integrated absorption per unit mass).Therefore, the synergistic effect from the materials in the nanocomposite is proposed to provide the remaining 50 photocatalytic enhancement. The ratio of quantum efficiencies for CO production, CO , for Cu 2 O/TiO 2 and Cu 2 O can be easily calculated from the established relationships between the initial reaction rates (R 0,CO ) and the absorbed photon fluxes I a , which was established in the response to the previous comment, Therefore, the relative quantum efficiencies in Eq (5) clearly demonstrate that Cu 2 O/TiO 2 has an enhanced photocatalytic activity over Cu 2 O. Another point of interest is that the evolution of CO decreases with the irradiation time.This is a characteristic of many photocatalytic process 10 and, in particular, has been observed for the The actual reason for this behavior is not well understood, and possible causes for the non-linear time profile are commonly ascribed to the strong interaction between Cu 2 O and CO, or the formation of O 2, which competes with carbon dioxide reduction 47.To get more insight, we investigate the rate of CO evolution in repeated 1 h irradiation cycles.After each run, the reactor was thoroughly evacuated and reloaded with the same amount of CO 2 and H 2 O before irradiation.Fig. 7 shows that after 4 cycles, CO yields slightly diminish, in sharp contrast with the results obtained under continuous irradiation.These experiments indicate that the inhibition observed in Fig. 6 is not irreversible, and the catalyst may be recycled without significant loss of efficiency, if the products are periodically removed. As The most relevant results are summarized in the Table 1, which details are provided in Fig. S7. XPS and XRD analysis allow us to discard the possible photoreduction of Cu(I) 30,46 and the TiO 2 holes localize on surface oxygen, forming (Ti 3 ) latt and (Ti 4 O -) surf para-magnetic species, respectively.By these processes, we achieved a heterostructure with strongly reductive electrons, the production rate of HO is 0.22 ( 0.03) mol g cat -1 h -1 .Comparatively, after 3 h of irradiation, the rate of production of CO is 5-times larger.By correcting the previous rates in a per photon basis using the stoichiometric consumptions of 2 e -CB and 1 h VB for CO and HO species produced, respectively, indicates that 40 of the theoretical amount of HO is trapped in 7-Hydroxycoumarin.The previous observation is not surprising for HO , a high reactivity and short lived species with a lifetime 1 ns 28. In the presence of CO 2 , additional evidence of water oxidation by Cu 2 O-TiO 2 nanostructures, comes from the analysis of the ratio between CO and O 2 yields.After 1 hr of irradiation, we determined CO/ mol g -1 cat 1.69 0.12 and O 2 / mol g -1 cat 0.83 0.06, which gives CO/O 2 1.69:0.83 2.03, in close agreement with the expected reaction stoichiometry. According to the Z-Scheme, the anodic reaction takes place in the Cu 2 O surface.In this regard, it is interesting to notice that the one electron homogeneous reduction potential for the monoelectronic reduction of CO 2 (Eq.( 1)), is more negative than the conduction band level of Cu 2 O (E CB (Cu 2 O) -1.39eV). Thus, in order to make the CO 2 reduction thermodynamically feasible, some stabilization must be invoked"}, {"llm generation": "Gas", "source": "The new material shows a 4-times enhancement for the photoreduction rate of CO2 induced by UV-visible irradiation in comparison to pure Cu2O.", "context": "A Cu2O/TiO2 photocatalyst with high morphologic and crystallographic quality was synthetized by a simple solvothermal method.The new material shows a 4-times enhancement for the photoreduction rate of CO2 induced by UV-visible irradiation in comparison to pure Cu2O.

Detailed analyses of the photocatalysts by XPS spectroscopy under operation, as well as the formation of OH radicals in the Cu2O-TiO2 system, at variance with the results for pure Cu2O, unequivocally prove a Z-Scheme mechanism.The results obtained are of practical interest for photocatalysis and are also relevant for the understanding of photoinduced interfacial chargetransfer processes at the p-n heterojunction.

Cu2O synthesis closely follows a previous published procedure 24.In a typical experiment, 6.66 g of PVP were dissolved in an aqueous solution of CuCl2.2H2O (0.01 mol L -1 , 100 mL) at 55 C.Then, 10.0 mL NaOH aqueous solution (2.0 mol L -1 ) was added dropwise into the above transparent light green solution.During this process, the solution color changes from blue-green to dark brown.The reaction mixture was stirred for 0.5 h, keeping the temperature at 55 C. Afterwards, 10 ml of an aqueous ascorbic acid solution (0.6 mol L -1 ) was added dropwise and the mixture was aged for 3 h under constant stirring and strict temperature control (55 C).This last stage gradually produces a red suspension.The resulting precipitate was collected by centrifugation and washed consecutively with 10 ml of deionized water and absolute ethanol (5 times).Finally, the solid was dried under vacuum at 60 C for 5 h for further use and characterization. When mentioned a thermal treatment was applied to the as-synthesized solid.Briefly, the solid was resuspended in absolute ethanol, transferred to 200 ml Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 180 C for 12 h in a programmable oven.An initial ramp of 1 C min -1 was used to achieve the final temperature. The modification of Cu 2 O octahedral was performed following the procedure developed by Liu et al 25.Briefly, 186 mg of Cu 2 O were resuspended in 65 ml of absolute ethanol with the aid of ultrasonication for 30 minutes, and the suspension was cooled at 0 C.At this temperature, 1.3 ml of titanium (IV) butoxide ethanolic solution (0.1 mol L -1 ) were added dropwise into the Cu 2 O suspension and stirred for 1 h at 0 C.Afterwards, 6.5 ml of a water:ethanol solution (volume ratio 1:4) were added dropwise to the mixture under vigorous stirring for another hour.The reaction mixture was diluted with 98 ml of absolute ethanol, transferred to 200 ml Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 180 C for 12 h in a programmable oven.An initial ramp of 1 C min -1 was used to achieve the final temperature.The amount of Cu 2 O and TiO 2 precursors used in this approach guarantee a nominal proportion of 0.05:0.95 of TiO 2 :Cu 2 O in weight.The product was collected by centrifugation and washed consecutively with 10 ml of deionized water and absolute ethanol (5 times).Finally, the solid was dried in vacuum at 60 C for 5 h for further use and characterization. Pure TiO 2 was obtained using the same solvothermal procedure described above, in absence of Cu 2 O crystals. The crystalline properties of the as-prepared samples were analyzed via powder X-ray diffraction (XRD).The analysis was carried out on a X'Pert PRO (PANalytical) powder X-ray diffractometer, with Cu K (1.54 A) as the incident radiation and operated at an accelerating voltage of 40 kV with a current intensity of 40 mA. The morphology of the samples was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using a Hitachi S-4300 instrument with an accelerating voltage of 25 kV.A ca. 10 L drop of colloidal suspension in ethanol (10 mg ml -1 ) was put on a SEM grid and dried under a red light lamp.The phase distribution in the Au-metallized samples, was analyzed by Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) by using a Jeol JSM-6460LV scanning electron microscope, operating at 15 kV coupled to a EDS probe Genesis XM4-Sys 60.X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements of the powdered samples were conducted using PHI VersaProbe II spectrometer with an Al K- anode (1486.6 eV photon energy, 86.6 W).Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) studies were carried out by using a PHI 5600 system with He (10.2 eV) as monochromatic light source with a polarization potential (bias) of -5.0 eV.All values determined from UPS analysis are referred to vacuum.The diffuse reflectance UV-visible (DRUV) spectra of the powered samples were obtained with an Evolution 220, ISA-220 accessory, Thermo Scientific UV-vis spectrophotometer using a built-in 10 mm silicon photodiode with a 60 mm Spectralon sphere.The ISA-220 accessory was used in a configuration to register the diffuse reflectance spectrum of dry solid powders as a Kubelka-Munk function against the certified Spectralon standard 14. The photocatalytic experiments were performed in 135 cm 3 customized quartz photoreactor with flat circular windows (diameter 5.08 cm).Based on the elemental distribution obtained by SEM-EDS analysis (See Supporting Information, S1), 3 mL of suspensions of appropriate concentrations to deposit 30 mg of Cu2O/TiO2, 28.4 mg of Cu2O, and 1.6 mg TiO2 were uniformly deposited in one of the reactor windows, and left to dry overnight.The reactor was then filled with 1 atm CO2(g) saturated with water vapor by sparging the gas during 20 min (0.5 L min -1 ) through a gas wash bottle.The reactor sealed with septa was kept in the dark for 1 hour before irradiation to ensure a homogenous internal atmosphere.UV-visible irradiation was performed with a collimated 1 kW high-pressure Hg (Xe) arc lamp provided with a water filter and a cut-off filter at 305 nm (Newport) previously described 14.The irradiance of the lamp was measured in the interval 305 665 nm with a calibrated radiometer (Ocean Optics).Gas aliquots of 0.5 cm 3 were taken from the reactor at different irradiation times for analysis by gas chromatography (SRI 8610C, Multiple Gas 3 GC) equipped with two columns (a silica gel HaySep D as column 1 and a MoleSieve 13X as column 2), a thermal conductivity detector (TCD), and a flame ionization (FID) detector interfaced to a methanizer.The irradiation of the photocatalyst and quantification of produced CO(g) were performed at room temperature (20 C).Additionally, the reaction products were identified by FTIR spectroscopy using a 2.4 m path length infrared gas cell with ZnSe windows (PIKE) thermostatted at 100 C mounted in an iZ10 FTIR module connected to an infrared microscope (Thermo Scientific Nicolet iN10) 26.Furthermore, photocatalyst alteration during irradiation was monitored by XPS using a Thermo-Scientific K-Alpha X-ray Photoelectron Spectrometer with an Al K- anode (1486.6 eV photon energy, 300 W). The formation of hydroxyl radicals (HO ) on the surface of irradiated Cu2O/TiO2 was quantified using the coumarin fluorescence method with a Lumina Fluorescence Spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) using excitation at exc 332 nm.While coumarin is a poorly fluorescent molecule, it is an excellent probe to quantify HO trapped in the produced 7-hydroxycoumarin.The XRD pattern of pure TiO 2 (Fig. 1), obtained in a parallel synthesis is in agreement with the report for anatase (JCPDS 21-1272)."}], "operation mode": []}}
