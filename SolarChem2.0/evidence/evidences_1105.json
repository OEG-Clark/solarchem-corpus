The In 2 O 3 -rGO nanocomposites were synthesized by the modified sol-gel process 29.For the preparation of In 2 O 3 -rGO nanocomposites with different concentrations of In 2 O 3 , initially, two solutions were prepared.The one solution was obtained by ultrasonication of the mixture of 20 mg of graphene oxide into 20 ml of ethanol and other solution prepared by dispersing indium nitrate hexahydrate (i.e.1.30 g, 2.61 g, 3.91 g) into 20 ml ethanol.Both the solutions were sonicated for 15 min.Then, graphene oxide solution was added dropwise into a homogeneous solution of an indium oxide precursor solution, which was continuously stirred at 80 C and 500 rpm on a hotplate.The pH of the above-mixed solution was 5 at this stage.The ammonia solution (25 in water) was added to maintain its pH at 9. To reduce the graphene oxide, 1 ml of hydrazine solution was added into the obtained mixture.The resulting solution was stirred continuously for 2 h.The solution was Initially, 5.225 gm of indium nitrate hexahydrate was mixed with 100 ml DI water.Then, the solution was kept at 80 C and 500 rpm on a magnetic stirrer with a hotplate.A homogeneous solution containing indium ions was obtained.The ammonia solution was added dropwise to maintain the pH of the solution at 9. The solution was continuously stirred for 2 h.The solution was washed 5-6 times by DI water to remove the unreacted nitrates ions.The resulted solution was dried into an oven at 120 C for about 7 h.The obtained powder was ground into mortar pestle for 15 min and then further calcined into a tubular furnace at 400 C for 4 h in an argon environment with argon flow rate of 100 sccm.After the calcination, In 2 O 3 nanostructures were formed due to complete phase transformation of indium hydroxides. The X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku Ultima IV, Ri) equipped with monochromatic Cu-K radiation ( 1.541 A) as the X-ray source was used to monitor the crystalline phase of pristine In 2 O 3 nanostructures and In 2 O 3 -rGO nanocomposites.Technai G 20 high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) was used to analyze the crystallographic facets and crystal structures of the In 2 O 3 -rGO nanocomposites.The photocatalysts on the carbon-coated nickel grid was used for the HRTEM measurements.The Jeol JSM-7800 F Prime field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) was used for the morphology studies of the pristine In 2 O 3 nanostructures and In 2 O 3 -rGO nanocomposites.Raman spectroscopy measurements of the photocatalysts were performed with the HORIBA LabRAM HR Evolution system equipped with an Ar ion laser of 514 nm wavelength.The V o defects in In 2 O 3 nanostructures, and In 2 O 3 -rGO nanocomposites were explored by photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy measurements with a He-Cd laser (excitation wavelength of 325 nm).For Raman and PL measurements, the samples were prepared by drop-casting the photocatalysts solution (which was obtained after the ultrasonication of 3 mg of the photocatalysts in 3 ml of ethanol) on 0.5 0.5 cm 2 n-type silicon wafer.Additionally, to quantify the relative V o concentration, and chemical coupling in the photocatalysts, the XPS measurements of In 2 O 3 nanostructures, and In 2 O 3 -2 wt rGO nanocomposite were performed with Thermo Fisher Scientific Instruments, UK spectrometer.The Al K was used as an X-ray source with beam current of 6 mA and 12 kV.The optical properties of all the photocatalysts were investigated by ultra violet-visible (UV-VIS) spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer Lambda 1050).The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and linear transient current density measurements were carried out with the photoelectrochemical workstation (Zehner Zennium, PP 211) and threeelectrode assembly cell.The Pt wire was used as a counter electrode.The Ag/AgCl/saturated KCl, and sample coated on ITO substrate used as a reference electrode, and working electrode, respectively.0.5 M Na 2 SO 4 solution used as electrolyte solution during all photoelectrochemical measurements.A halogen lamp of power 100 mW/cm 2 was used to irradiate the working electrode during the photoelectrochemical measurements.The transient current density was measured at potential 1.0 V vs Ag/AgCl for all photocatalysts.The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed out over the frequency range of 100 mHz to 100 kHz at zero bias potential vs Ag/AgCl to investigate the charge transfer mechanism in the photocatalysts. The photocatalytic activity of catalysts for CO 2 reduction will be performed in a sealed photoreactor equipped with a 250 W mercury vapor lamp (wavelength 400-700 nm).Briefly, the experimental setup consists of a mass-flow controller to control the CO 2 feed into the quartz reactor with a temperature controller, magnetic stirrer, and gas chromatography.For each experiment, initially, CO 2 was purged for 30 min through the solution, containing 0.1 g of photocatalyst and 2 M NaOH in a quartz photoreactor.The resulting solution was magnetically stirred at 500 rpm, so that CO 2 was soluble in solution.The flow of CO 2 was maintained at 15 sccm by using the Alicat Scientific mass flow controller.Then, liquid as well as a gaseous sample were collected after 30 min.Thereafter, the mercury-vapor lamp was switched ON and both liquid and gaseous samples were collected after every 30 min.The liquid product was analyzed by 680 Clarus Perkin Elmer GCMS with FFAP (Nitroterepathalic acid modified polyethylene glycol) column and the gaseous product was analyzed through GC, NUCON 5765 equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) for H 2 gas and a flame ionization detector (FID) for CO and hydrocarbons.The whole experiments were carried out in a photoreactor at room temperature and atmospheric pressure."}, {"llm generation": "In 2 O 3 -rGO nanocomposite", "source": "In our present work, we have obtained the selective product CH 4 on In 2 O 3 -rGO nanocomposite by the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .", "context": "The XRD pattern of In (calculated by Debye Scherrer formulae), respectively.However, in the XRD pattern of all In 2 O 3 -rGO nanocomposites, diffraction peaks correspond to rGO were not observed.This may be due to the addition of a small amount of rGO in the nanocomposites.The purity of samples was assured as no impurity peaks were observed in the XRD pattern of In 2 O nanostructures and In 2 O 3 -rGO nanocomposites. The presence of rGO in the In 2 O 3 -rGO nanocomposites was confirmed by performing the Raman spectroscopy measurements as shown in Fig. 2. The peaks at 95, 133, 302, 366, 493, and 626 cm - correspond to vibrational modes of body-centered cubic phase of In 2 O 30,31, and peaks at 1351 cm -1 and 1589 cm -1 correspond to D and G band of reduced graphene oxide 32. There was no shift in the Raman peaks with the variation of the rGO amount of 4, 2, and 1.3 wt in the In 2 O 3 -rGO nanocomposites.However, the intensity of peak corresponding to rGO increases as its content increases from 1. nanocomposites.Additionally, the EDS mapping measurements of In 2 O 3 -2 wt rGO nanocomposite were monitored as shown in Fig. S1. of supporting information.The presence of indium, and oxygen on the rGO sheets also support the synergetic interaction between In 2 O 3 and rGO sheets in nanocomposite. Fig. 4a-c depicted the TEM images of nanocomposites, represents the distribution of In 2 O 3 nanoparticles on rGO sheets.The crystallinity of the catalysts was confirmed by performing the HRTEM measurements (Fig. 4d-f).The measured lattice spacing of In 2 O 3 was 0.285 nm, which corresponds to (222) plane of In 2 O 3 in the nanocomposites (Fig. 4d-f) 32,33. PL spectra depicted the relative concentration of V o defects in the In 2 O 3 nanostructures and In 2 O 3 -rGO nanocomposites by their relative peak intensities (Fig. 5).The peak at wavelength 560 nm corresponds to oxygen vacancies defects that were observed in In 2 O 3 nanostructures as well as in In 2 O 3 -rGO samples 30,34.Thus, the In 2 O 3 nanostructures sample has the least V o defects, while, In 2 O 3 -2 wt rGO nanocomposite sample showed the maximum V o defects concentration. Further, to investigate the effect of addition of rGO in In 2 O 3 -rGO nanocomposite on V o defect concentrations and chemical coupling, the XPS measurements of In 2 O 3 nanostructures, and In 2 O 3 -2 wt rGO nanocomposite were performed (Fig. 6).Fig. 6a demonstrated that in In 3d spectra, the peaks at 444.4 eV and 452.0 eV were corresponding to In3d 5/2 , and In3d 3/2 transitions of In 2 O 3 nanostructures, respectively 35.In case of In 2 O 3 -2 wt rGO nanocomposite, the peaks belong to In3d 5/2 and In3d 3/2 transitions were shifted towards higher binding energy value, indicating the chemical coupling interactions between In 2 O 3 and rGO 10.The peaks at 529.9 eV, 531.5 eV, and 532.respectively.Thus, the optical bandgap for In 2 O 3 -rGO nanocomposites was tuned towards the visible region, which further assist to improve the chemical coupling interaction between In 2 O 3 and rGO sheets in nanocomposites 3,10,27. The photocatalytic activity measurements of In 2 O 3 -rGO nanocomposites were performed in a closed photo-reactor as shown in Fig. 8.For controlled experiments, we have performed the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 experiments without photocatalyst and light, but there was no product obtained.Thus, there was a requirement of both the catalyst and visible light source for photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .Fig. 9 depicts the quantification of the obtained gaseous product of the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 on In 2 O 3 and In 2 O 3 -rGO nanocomposites samples.For the In 2 O 3 nanostructures, mainly the liquid product ethanol with maximum yield of 61.53 mol/g was obtained. However, In 2 O 3 -rGO nanocomposites does not exhibiting any liquid product by photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with visible light source.The gaseous product distribution obtained on photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 on In 2 O 3 nanostructures is represented in Fig. 9a.A very less amount of CH 4 was obtained by photocatalytic CO 2 reduction process on the In 2 O 3 catalyst.This may be due to a wide bandgap of In 2 O 3 nanostructures (i.e.2.95 eV) and a fast recombination rate of electron-hole pairs 10. However, catalyst surface properties significantly influence the distribution of the product 39.In our present work, we have obtained the selective product CH 4 on In 2 O 3 -rGO nanocomposite by the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .The order of CH 4 yield obtained by photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 was follows as In 2 O 3 -2 wt rGO In 2 O 3 -1.3wt rGO In 2 O 3 -4 wt rGO In 2 O 3 nanostructures.The gaseous product obtained by photocatalytic reduction process on all photocatalysts are represented in Table 1 and Fig. 9.The In 2 O 3 -rGO nanocomposites possessed higher photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction to CH 4 as compared to In 2 O 3 nanostructures with the visible light irradiation. The chemical coupling interaction between the rGO and In 2 O 3 in In 2 O 3 -2 wt rGO nanocomposite favors the transfers of electrons from the conduction band of In 2 O 3 to rGO sheets.As the rGO sheets have a large surface area, which controlled the accumulation of electrons, resulting in a decrease of local electron density.In 2 O 3 -rGO nanocomposites samples exhibit bandgap in the visible region due to the presence of a 2-dimensional - conjugation structure of rGO sheets, which acts as the transporter of electrons from the In 2 O 3 nanostructures, resulting slower recombination of the electron-hole pairs, and hence enhances the photocatalytic reaction 27,40.Thus, the synergistic interaction due to d- electron orbital overlap between rGO and In 2 O 3 in the In 2 O 3 -rGO nanocomposites enhances its catalytic activity towards CO 2 reduction 41.Fig. 9c shows the quantification of the gaseous product obtained by photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 on In 2 O 3 -2 wt rGO nanocomposite. The maximum CH 4 yield on In 2 O 3 -2 wt rGO nanocomposite obtained was 953.72 mol/g, which can be explained on the basis of presence of V o defects on photocatalyst surface.From the PL spectra (Fig. 5), it was observed that In 2 O 3 -rGO nanocomposites has higher V o defects as compared to In 2 O 3 nanostructures.The V o defects introduce intermediate donar level that results in more delocalization of energy states.Thus, position of the fermi level is shifted towards the conduction band, and valence band position is raised upwards 42.Thus, the more oxygen vacancies concentrations assist in narrowing the band gap which promotes the charge separation and transport 4,43,44, and boost the CO 2 adsorption 45,46, resulting enhancement of the photocatalytic activity of In 2 O 3 -rGO nanocomposite.The In 2 O 3 -2 wt rGO nanocomposite possessed the highest V o defects among all the nanocomposites studied in present research work.This results in the slowest recombination rate of electron-hole pairs among all the catalysts, which facilitates the reduction of CO 2 38,47.The schematic for the mechanism involved in the CO 2 reduction to CH 4 is given in Fig. 10. To instigate the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 , the generation of electron-hole pairs with sufficient lifetime and oxidation-reduction potentials of the product are the fundamental steps.The water is oxidized by the photogenerated holes, resulting in the creation of the H ions.The photogenerated electrons along with H ions are utilized for the formation of methane and ethanol.For photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to CH 4 , the valance band redox potential of the catalyst should be higher than water splitting reduction potential (E 0.82V) 48, and conduction band edge redox potential should be more negative than CO 2 /CH 4 and CO 2 /C 2 H 5 OH.The conduction band potentials of In 2 O 3 is -0.63 V vs NHE 48,49, and valance band edge was located at 2.24 V vs NHE 48, which is more negative than the reduction potential of formation of methane (E -0.24V vs NHE) 50, and ethanol (E -0.38V) 15, resulting into preferable reduction of CO 2 into CH 4 and C 2 H 5 OH.The reaction involved in the formation of CH 4 on the In 2 O 3 -rGO nanocomposite are as follows: Thus, in In 2 O 3 -rGO nanocomposites, the lifetime of photogenerated electron-hole pairs increases due to the overlap of d- electron orbitals between rGO and In 2 O 3 , which are participating in the reaction involved in CO 2 reduction.Thus nanocomposites possessed improved CH 4 yield as compared to In 2 O 3 nanostructures.Moreover, the In 2 O 3 -2 wt rGO nanocomposite sample has highest V o defects.Hence, it exhibits maximum yield of selective product methane because V o defects act as the active sites for CO 2 adsorption 38,47.However, further addition of content of rGO leads to a decrement of the performance of nanocomposite catalysts towards the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 , which may be because of more addition of graphene prevents the light reaching to metal oxides nanostructures 26,51, and hence, reduce the generation of electrons and holes that results in decreasing the catalytic activity. To explore the photocatalytic activity of these photocatalysts using the visible light source, transient photocurrent density, and EIS measurements were carried out.Fig. 11a shows the transient photocurrent density spectra of In 2 O 3, In 2 O 3 -4 wt rGO, In 2 O 3 -2 wt rGO, and In 2 O 3 -1.3wt rGO nanocomposites under dark and light source conditions.The In 2 O 3 -2 wt rGO nanocomposite exhibited the highest transient photocurrent density response with the light switched -on and -off conditions among all the photocatalysts which revealed the prolonged lifetime of electron-hole pairs recombination in it, and hence facilitate the synergistic interaction between In 2 O 3 and rGO.Additionally, in EIS spectra (Nyquist plots), the smallest radius arc has been observed for In 2 O 3 -2 wt rGO nanocomposite which confirmed that In 2 O 3 -2 wt rGO catalyst has the least resistance as shown in Fig. 11b.Thus, highest photocurrent density and least resistance possessed by In 2 O 3 -2 wt rGO nanocomposite revealed that there was slowest recombination and further efficient participation of charge carriers in reaction, resulting its highest photocatalytic activity towards CO 2 reduction to CH 4 .The comparison of photocatalytic performance of previously reported catalysts with our catalyst was given in Table S1.Table S1 depicted that the maximum product yield obtained by In 2 O 3 -2 wt rGO nanocomposite was higher as compared to other photocatalysts.We have also tested the stability of In 2 O 3 -2 wt rGO nanocomposite by performing the photocatalytic reduction measurements in three cycles under the similar reaction conditions.The maximum yield of major product CH 4 achieved by In 2 O 3 -2 wt rGO nanocomposite in 1 st , 2 nd , and 3 rd cycles of CO 2 reduction experiments were 953.72, 949.55, and 965.53 mol/g, respectively (Fig. S2).The major product yield of CH 4 was approximate equal, obtained in three cycles by In 2 O 3 -2 wt rGO nanocomposite.Thus, In 2 O 3 -2 wt rGO nanocomposite may be considered as efficient and stable photocatalyst for photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 to CH 4 under visible light irradiation."}, {"llm generation": "In 2 O 3 nanostructures", "source": "A very less amount of CH 4 was obtained by photocatalytic CO 2 reduction process on the In 2 O 3 catalyst.", "context": "The XRD pattern of In (calculated by Debye Scherrer formulae), respectively.However, in the XRD pattern of all In 2 O 3 -rGO nanocomposites, diffraction peaks correspond to rGO were not observed.This may be due to the addition of a small amount of rGO in the nanocomposites.The purity of samples was assured as no impurity peaks were observed in the XRD pattern of In 2 O nanostructures and In 2 O 3 -rGO nanocomposites.

To explore the photocatalytic activity of these photocatalysts using the visible light source, transient photocurrent density, and EIS measurements were carried out.Fig. 11a shows the transient photocurrent density spectra of In 2 O 3, In 2 O 3 -4 wt rGO, In 2 O 3 -2 wt rGO, and In 2 O 3 -1.3wt rGO nanocomposites under dark and light source conditions.The In 2 O 3 -2 wt rGO nanocomposite exhibited the highest transient photocurrent density response with the light switched -on and -off conditions among all the photocatalysts which revealed the prolonged lifetime of electron-hole pairs recombination in it, and hence facilitate the synergistic interaction between In 2 O 3 and rGO.Additionally, in EIS spectra (Nyquist plots), the smallest radius arc has been observed for In 2 O 3 -2 wt rGO nanocomposite which confirmed that In 2 O 3 -2 wt rGO catalyst has the least resistance as shown in Fig. 11b.Thus, highest photocurrent density and least resistance possessed by In 2 O 3 -2 wt rGO nanocomposite revealed that there was slowest recombination and further efficient participation of charge carriers in reaction, resulting its highest photocatalytic activity towards CO 2 reduction to CH 4 .The comparison of photocatalytic performance of previously reported catalysts with our catalyst was given in Table S1.Table S1 depicted that the maximum product yield obtained by In 2 O 3 -2 wt rGO nanocomposite was higher as compared to other photocatalysts.We have also tested the stability of In 2 O 3 -2 wt rGO nanocomposite by performing the photocatalytic reduction measurements in three cycles under the similar reaction conditions.The maximum yield of major product CH 4 achieved by In 2 O 3 -2 wt rGO nanocomposite in 1 st , 2 nd , and 3 rd cycles of CO 2 reduction experiments were 953.72, 949.55, and 965.53 mol/g, respectively (Fig. S2).The major product yield of CH 4 was approximate equal, obtained in three cycles by In 2 O 3 -2 wt rGO nanocomposite.Thus, In 2 O 3 -2 wt rGO nanocomposite may be considered as efficient and stable photocatalyst for photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 to CH 4 under visible light irradiation."}, {"llm generation": "In 2 O 3 -2 wt rGO", "source": "Moreover, In 2 O 3 -2 wt rGO catalyst showed the highest CH 4 yield, which is due to shifting of its bandgap towards the visible range, and having maximum number of oxygen vacancies defects, comparatively, which act as the active sites for catalytic reaction involved in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 to CH 4 .", "context": "In the present work In 2 O 3 nanostructures, In 2 O 3 -4 wt rGO, In 2 O 3 -2 wt rGO, and In 2 O 3 -1.3wt rGO nanocomposites samples were synthesized by a modified sol-gel method.A poor photocatalytic activity towards selective CH 4 product was obtained on pristine In 2 O 3 nanostructures.However, In 2 O 3 -rGO nanocomposites exhibited a better response towards CH 4 yield as compared to pristine In 2 O 3 nanostructures.This was because of enhancement of chemical contact between rGO and In 2 O 3 , which is due to overlap of d- electron orbitals in the In 2 O 3 -rGO nanocomposites that results in decreasing the recombination rate of photogenerated electron-hole pairs.Moreover, In 2 O 3 -2 wt rGO catalyst showed the highest CH 4 yield, which is due to shifting of its bandgap towards the visible range, and having maximum number of oxygen vacancies defects, comparatively, which act as the active sites for catalytic reaction involved in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 to CH 4 .We believe that our finding would provide some new insights for enhancement of photocatalytic activity by developing robust and efficient CO 2 reduction photocatalyst.

The presence of rGO in the In 2 O 3 -rGO nanocomposites was confirmed by performing the Raman spectroscopy measurements as shown in Fig. 2. The peaks at 95, 133, 302, 366, 493, and 626 cm - correspond to vibrational modes of body-centered cubic phase of In 2 O 30,31, and peaks at 1351 cm -1 and 1589 cm -1 correspond to D and G band of reduced graphene oxide 32. There was no shift in the Raman peaks with the variation of the rGO amount of 4, 2, and 1.3 wt in the In 2 O 3 -rGO nanocomposites.However, the intensity of peak corresponding to rGO increases as its content increases from 1. nanocomposites.Additionally, the EDS mapping measurements of In 2 O 3 -2 wt rGO nanocomposite were monitored as shown in Fig. S1. of supporting information.The presence of indium, and oxygen on the rGO sheets also support the synergetic interaction between In 2 O 3 and rGO sheets in nanocomposite. Fig. 4a-c depicted the TEM images of nanocomposites, represents the distribution of In 2 O 3 nanoparticles on rGO sheets.The crystallinity of the catalysts was confirmed by performing the HRTEM measurements (Fig. 4d-f).The measured lattice spacing of In 2 O 3 was 0.285 nm, which corresponds to (222) plane of In 2 O 3 in the nanocomposites (Fig. 4d-f) 32,33. PL spectra depicted the relative concentration of V o defects in the In 2 O 3 nanostructures and In 2 O 3 -rGO nanocomposites by their relative peak intensities (Fig. 5).The peak at wavelength 560 nm corresponds to oxygen vacancies defects that were observed in In 2 O 3 nanostructures as well as in In 2 O 3 -rGO samples 30,34.Thus, the In 2 O 3 nanostructures sample has the least V o defects, while, In 2 O 3 -2 wt rGO nanocomposite sample showed the maximum V o defects concentration. Further, to investigate the effect of addition of rGO in In 2 O 3 -rGO nanocomposite on V o defect concentrations and chemical coupling, the XPS measurements of In 2 O 3 nanostructures, and In 2 O 3 -2 wt rGO nanocomposite were performed (Fig. 6).Fig. 6a demonstrated that in In 3d spectra, the peaks at 444.4 eV and 452.0 eV were corresponding to In3d 5/2 , and In3d 3/2 transitions of In 2 O 3 nanostructures, respectively 35.In case of In 2 O 3 -2 wt rGO nanocomposite, the peaks belong to In3d 5/2 and In3d 3/2 transitions were shifted towards higher binding energy value, indicating the chemical coupling interactions between In 2 O 3 and rGO 10.The peaks at 529.9 eV, 531.5 eV, and 532.respectively.Thus, the optical bandgap for In 2 O 3 -rGO nanocomposites was tuned towards the visible region, which further assist to improve the chemical coupling interaction between In 2 O 3 and rGO sheets in nanocomposites 3,10,27. The photocatalytic activity measurements of In 2 O 3 -rGO nanocomposites were performed in a closed photo-reactor as shown in Fig. 8.For controlled experiments, we have performed the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 experiments without photocatalyst and light, but there was no product obtained.Thus, there was a requirement of both the catalyst and visible light source for photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .Fig. 9 depicts the quantification of the obtained gaseous product of the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 on In 2 O 3 and In 2 O 3 -rGO nanocomposites samples.For the In 2 O 3 nanostructures, mainly the liquid product ethanol with maximum yield of 61.53 mol/g was obtained. However, In 2 O 3 -rGO nanocomposites does not exhibiting any liquid product by photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with visible light source.The gaseous product distribution obtained on photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 on In 2 O 3 nanostructures is represented in Fig. 9a.A very less amount of CH 4 was obtained by photocatalytic CO 2 reduction process on the In 2 O 3 catalyst.This may be due to a wide bandgap of In 2 O 3 nanostructures (i.e.2.95 eV) and a fast recombination rate of electron-hole pairs 10. However, catalyst surface properties significantly influence the distribution of the product 39.In our present work, we have obtained the selective product CH 4 on In 2 O 3 -rGO nanocomposite by the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .The order of CH 4 yield obtained by photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 was follows as In 2 O 3 -2 wt rGO In 2 O 3 -1.3wt rGO In 2 O 3 -4 wt rGO In 2 O 3 nanostructures.The gaseous product obtained by photocatalytic reduction process on all photocatalysts are represented in Table 1 and Fig. 9.The In 2 O 3 -rGO nanocomposites possessed higher photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction to CH 4 as compared to In 2 O 3 nanostructures with the visible light irradiation. The chemical coupling interaction between the rGO and In 2 O 3 in In 2 O 3 -2 wt rGO nanocomposite favors the transfers of electrons from the conduction band of In 2 O 3 to rGO sheets.As the rGO sheets have a large surface area, which controlled the accumulation of electrons, resulting in a decrease of local electron density.In 2 O 3 -rGO nanocomposites samples exhibit bandgap in the visible region due to the presence of a 2-dimensional - conjugation structure of rGO sheets, which acts as the transporter of electrons from the In 2 O 3 nanostructures, resulting slower recombination of the electron-hole pairs, and hence enhances the photocatalytic reaction 27,40.Thus, the synergistic interaction due to d- electron orbital overlap between rGO and In 2 O 3 in the In 2 O 3 -rGO nanocomposites enhances its catalytic activity towards CO 2 reduction 41.Fig. 9c shows the quantification of the gaseous product obtained by photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 on In 2 O 3 -2 wt rGO nanocomposite. The maximum CH 4 yield on In 2 O 3 -2 wt rGO nanocomposite obtained was 953.72 mol/g, which can be explained on the basis of presence of V o defects on photocatalyst surface.From the PL spectra (Fig. 5), it was observed that In 2 O 3 -rGO nanocomposites has higher V o defects as compared to In 2 O 3 nanostructures.The V o defects introduce intermediate donar level that results in more delocalization of energy states.Thus, position of the fermi level is shifted towards the conduction band, and valence band position is raised upwards 42.Thus, the more oxygen vacancies concentrations assist in narrowing the band gap which promotes the charge separation and transport 4,43,44, and boost the CO 2 adsorption 45,46, resulting enhancement of the photocatalytic activity of In 2 O 3 -rGO nanocomposite.The In 2 O 3 -2 wt rGO nanocomposite possessed the highest V o defects among all the nanocomposites studied in present research work.This results in the slowest recombination rate of electron-hole pairs among all the catalysts, which facilitates the reduction of CO 2 38,47.The schematic for the mechanism involved in the CO 2 reduction to CH 4 is given in Fig. 10. To instigate the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 , the generation of electron-hole pairs with sufficient lifetime and oxidation-reduction potentials of the product are the fundamental steps.The water is oxidized by the photogenerated holes, resulting in the creation of the H ions.The photogenerated electrons along with H ions are utilized for the formation of methane and ethanol.For photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to CH 4 , the valance band redox potential of the catalyst should be higher than water splitting reduction potential (E 0.82V) 48, and conduction band edge redox potential should be more negative than CO 2 /CH 4 and CO 2 /C 2 H 5 OH.The conduction band potentials of In 2 O 3 is -0.63 V vs NHE 48,49, and valance band edge was located at 2.24 V vs NHE 48, which is more negative than the reduction potential of formation of methane (E -0.24V vs NHE) 50, and ethanol (E -0.38V) 15, resulting into preferable reduction of CO 2 into CH 4 and C 2 H 5 OH.The reaction involved in the formation of CH 4 on the In 2 O 3 -rGO nanocomposite are as follows: Thus, in In 2 O 3 -rGO nanocomposites, the lifetime of photogenerated electron-hole pairs increases due to the overlap of d- electron orbitals between rGO and In 2 O 3 , which are participating in the reaction involved in CO 2 reduction.Thus nanocomposites possessed improved CH 4 yield as compared to In 2 O 3 nanostructures.Moreover, the In 2 O 3 -2 wt rGO nanocomposite sample has highest V o defects.Hence, it exhibits maximum yield of selective product methane because V o defects act as the active sites for CO 2 adsorption 38,47.However, further addition of content of rGO leads to a decrement of the performance of nanocomposite catalysts towards the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 , which may be because of more addition of graphene prevents the light reaching to metal oxides nanostructures 26,51, and hence, reduce the generation of electrons and holes that results in decreasing the catalytic activity. To explore the photocatalytic activity of these photocatalysts using the visible light source, transient photocurrent density, and EIS measurements were carried out.Fig. 11a shows the transient photocurrent density spectra of In 2 O 3, In 2 O 3 -4 wt rGO, In 2 O 3 -2 wt rGO, and In 2 O 3 -1.3wt rGO nanocomposites under dark and light source conditions.The In 2 O 3 -2 wt rGO nanocomposite exhibited the highest transient photocurrent density response with the light switched -on and -off conditions among all the photocatalysts which revealed the prolonged lifetime of electron-hole pairs recombination in it, and hence facilitate the synergistic interaction between In 2 O 3 and rGO.Additionally, in EIS spectra (Nyquist plots), the smallest radius arc has been observed for In 2 O 3 -2 wt rGO nanocomposite which confirmed that In 2 O 3 -2 wt rGO catalyst has the least resistance as shown in Fig. 11b.Thus, highest photocurrent density and least resistance possessed by In 2 O 3 -2 wt rGO nanocomposite revealed that there was slowest recombination and further efficient participation of charge carriers in reaction, resulting its highest photocatalytic activity towards CO 2 reduction to CH 4 .The comparison of photocatalytic performance of previously reported catalysts with our catalyst was given in Table S1.Table S1 depicted that the maximum product yield obtained by In 2 O 3 -2 wt rGO nanocomposite was higher as compared to other photocatalysts.We have also tested the stability of In 2 O 3 -2 wt rGO nanocomposite by performing the photocatalytic reduction measurements in three cycles under the similar reaction conditions.The maximum yield of major product CH 4 achieved by In 2 O 3 -2 wt rGO nanocomposite in 1 st , 2 nd , and 3 rd cycles of CO 2 reduction experiments were 953.72, 949.55, and 965.53 mol/g, respectively (Fig. S2).The major product yield of CH 4 was approximate equal, obtained in three cycles by In 2 O 3 -2 wt rGO nanocomposite.Thus, In 2 O 3 -2 wt rGO nanocomposite may be considered as efficient and stable photocatalyst for photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 to CH 4 under visible light irradiation."}, {"llm generation": "rGO", "source": "This was because of enhancement of chemical contact between rGO and In 2 O 3 , which is due to overlap of d- electron orbitals in the In 2 O 3 -rGO nanocomposites that results in decreasing the recombination rate of photogenerated electron-hole pairs.", "context": "In the present work In 2 O 3 nanostructures, In 2 O 3 -4 wt rGO, In 2 O 3 -2 wt rGO, and In 2 O 3 -1.3wt rGO nanocomposites samples were synthesized by a modified sol-gel method.A poor photocatalytic activity towards selective CH 4 product was obtained on pristine In 2 O 3 nanostructures.However, In 2 O 3 -rGO nanocomposites exhibited a better response towards CH 4 yield as compared to pristine In 2 O 3 nanostructures.This was because of enhancement of chemical contact between rGO and In 2 O 3 , which is due to overlap of d- electron orbitals in the In 2 O 3 -rGO nanocomposites that results in decreasing the recombination rate of photogenerated electron-hole pairs.Moreover, In 2 O 3 -2 wt rGO catalyst showed the highest CH 4 yield, which is due to shifting of its bandgap towards the visible range, and having maximum number of oxygen vacancies defects, comparatively, which act as the active sites for catalytic reaction involved in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 to CH 4 .We believe that our finding would provide some new insights for enhancement of photocatalytic activity by developing robust and efficient CO 2 reduction photocatalyst.

The presence of rGO in the In 2 O 3 -rGO nanocomposites was confirmed by performing the Raman spectroscopy measurements as shown in Fig. 2. The peaks at 95, 133, 302, 366, 493, and 626 cm - correspond to vibrational modes of body-centered cubic phase of In 2 O 30,31, and peaks at 1351 cm -1 and 1589 cm -1 correspond to D and G band of reduced graphene oxide 32. There was no shift in the Raman peaks with the variation of the rGO amount of 4, 2, and 1.3 wt in the In 2 O 3 -rGO nanocomposites.However, the intensity of peak corresponding to rGO increases as its content increases from 1. nanocomposites.Additionally, the EDS mapping measurements of In 2 O 3 -2 wt rGO nanocomposite were monitored as shown in Fig. S1. of supporting information.The presence of indium, and oxygen on the rGO sheets also support the synergetic interaction between In 2 O 3 and rGO sheets in nanocomposite. Fig. 4a-c depicted the TEM images of nanocomposites, represents the distribution of In 2 O 3 nanoparticles on rGO sheets.The crystallinity of the catalysts was confirmed by performing the HRTEM measurements (Fig. 4d-f).The measured lattice spacing of In 2 O 3 was 0.285 nm, which corresponds to (222) plane of In 2 O 3 in the nanocomposites (Fig. 4d-f) 32,33. PL spectra depicted the relative concentration of V o defects in the In 2 O 3 nanostructures and In 2 O 3 -rGO nanocomposites by their relative peak intensities (Fig. 5).The peak at wavelength 560 nm corresponds to oxygen vacancies defects that were observed in In 2 O 3 nanostructures as well as in In 2 O 3 -rGO samples 30,34.Thus, the In 2 O 3 nanostructures sample has the least V o defects, while, In 2 O 3 -2 wt rGO nanocomposite sample showed the maximum V o defects concentration. Further, to investigate the effect of addition of rGO in In 2 O 3 -rGO nanocomposite on V o defect concentrations and chemical coupling, the XPS measurements of In 2 O 3 nanostructures, and In 2 O 3 -2 wt rGO nanocomposite were performed (Fig. 6).Fig. 6a demonstrated that in In 3d spectra, the peaks at 444.4 eV and 452.0 eV were corresponding to In3d 5/2 , and In3d 3/2 transitions of In 2 O 3 nanostructures, respectively 35.In case of In 2 O 3 -2 wt rGO nanocomposite, the peaks belong to In3d 5/2 and In3d 3/2 transitions were shifted towards higher binding energy value, indicating the chemical coupling interactions between In 2 O 3 and rGO 10.The peaks at 529.9 eV, 531.5 eV, and 532.respectively.Thus, the optical bandgap for In 2 O 3 -rGO nanocomposites was tuned towards the visible region, which further assist to improve the chemical coupling interaction between In 2 O 3 and rGO sheets in nanocomposites 3,10,27. The photocatalytic activity measurements of In 2 O 3 -rGO nanocomposites were performed in a closed photo-reactor as shown in Fig. 8.For controlled experiments, we have performed the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 experiments without photocatalyst and light, but there was no product obtained.Thus, there was a requirement of both the catalyst and visible light source for photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .Fig. 9 depicts the quantification of the obtained gaseous product of the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 on In 2 O 3 and In 2 O 3 -rGO nanocomposites samples.For the In 2 O 3 nanostructures, mainly the liquid product ethanol with maximum yield of 61.53 mol/g was obtained. However, In 2 O 3 -rGO nanocomposites does not exhibiting any liquid product by photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with visible light source.The gaseous product distribution obtained on photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 on In 2 O 3 nanostructures is represented in Fig. 9a.A very less amount of CH 4 was obtained by photocatalytic CO 2 reduction process on the In 2 O 3 catalyst.This may be due to a wide bandgap of In 2 O 3 nanostructures (i.e.2.95 eV) and a fast recombination rate of electron-hole pairs 10. However, catalyst surface properties significantly influence the distribution of the product 39.In our present work, we have obtained the selective product CH 4 on In 2 O 3 -rGO nanocomposite by the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .The order of CH 4 yield obtained by photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 was follows as In 2 O 3 -2 wt rGO In 2 O 3 -1.3wt rGO In 2 O 3 -4 wt rGO In 2 O 3 nanostructures.The gaseous product obtained by photocatalytic reduction process on all photocatalysts are represented in Table 1 and Fig. 9.The In 2 O 3 -rGO nanocomposites possessed higher photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction to CH 4 as compared to In 2 O 3 nanostructures with the visible light irradiation. The chemical coupling interaction between the rGO and In 2 O 3 in In 2 O 3 -2 wt rGO nanocomposite favors the transfers of electrons from the conduction band of In 2 O 3 to rGO sheets.As the rGO sheets have a large surface area, which controlled the accumulation of electrons, resulting in a decrease of local electron density.In 2 O 3 -rGO nanocomposites samples exhibit bandgap in the visible region due to the presence of a 2-dimensional - conjugation structure of rGO sheets, which acts as the transporter of electrons from the In 2 O 3 nanostructures, resulting slower recombination of the electron-hole pairs, and hence enhances the photocatalytic reaction 27,40.Thus, the synergistic interaction due to d- electron orbital overlap between rGO and In 2 O 3 in the In 2 O 3 -rGO nanocomposites enhances its catalytic activity towards CO 2 reduction 41.Fig. 9c shows the quantification of the gaseous product obtained by photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 on In 2 O 3 -2 wt rGO nanocomposite. The maximum CH 4 yield on In 2 O 3 -2 wt rGO nanocomposite obtained was 953.72 mol/g, which can be explained on the basis of presence of V o defects on photocatalyst surface.From the PL spectra (Fig. 5), it was observed that In 2 O 3 -rGO nanocomposites has higher V o defects as compared to In 2 O 3 nanostructures.The V o defects introduce intermediate donar level that results in more delocalization of energy states.Thus, position of the fermi level is shifted towards the conduction band, and valence band position is raised upwards 42.Thus, the more oxygen vacancies concentrations assist in narrowing the band gap which promotes the charge separation and transport 4,43,44, and boost the CO 2 adsorption 45,46, resulting enhancement of the photocatalytic activity of In 2 O 3 -rGO nanocomposite.The In 2 O 3 -2 wt rGO nanocomposite possessed the highest V o defects among all the nanocomposites studied in present research work.This results in the slowest recombination rate of electron-hole pairs among all the catalysts, which facilitates the reduction of CO 2 38,47.The schematic for the mechanism involved in the CO 2 reduction to CH 4 is given in Fig. 10. To instigate the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 , the generation of electron-hole pairs with sufficient lifetime and oxidation-reduction potentials of the product are the fundamental steps.The water is oxidized by the photogenerated holes, resulting in the creation of the H ions.The photogenerated electrons along with H ions are utilized for the formation of methane and ethanol.For photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to CH 4 , the valance band redox potential of the catalyst should be higher than water splitting reduction potential (E 0.82V) 48, and conduction band edge redox potential should be more negative than CO 2 /CH 4 and CO 2 /C 2 H 5 OH.The conduction band potentials of In 2 O 3 is -0.63 V vs NHE 48,49, and valance band edge was located at 2.24 V vs NHE 48, which is more negative than the reduction potential of formation of methane (E -0.24V vs NHE) 50, and ethanol (E -0.38V) 15, resulting into preferable reduction of CO 2 into CH 4 and C 2 H 5 OH.The reaction involved in the formation of CH 4 on the In 2 O 3 -rGO nanocomposite are as follows: Thus, in In 2 O 3 -rGO nanocomposites, the lifetime of photogenerated electron-hole pairs increases due to the overlap of d- electron orbitals between rGO and In 2 O 3 , which are participating in the reaction involved in CO 2 reduction.Thus nanocomposites possessed improved CH 4 yield as compared to In 2 O 3 nanostructures.Moreover, the In 2 O 3 -2 wt rGO nanocomposite sample has highest V o defects.Hence, it exhibits maximum yield of selective product methane because V o defects act as the active sites for CO 2 adsorption 38,47.However, further addition of content of rGO leads to a decrement of the performance of nanocomposite catalysts towards the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 , which may be because of more addition of graphene prevents the light reaching to metal oxides nanostructures 26,51, and hence, reduce the generation of electrons and holes that results in decreasing the catalytic activity.

The X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku Ultima IV, Ri) equipped with monochromatic Cu-K radiation ( 1.541 A) as the X-ray source was used to monitor the crystalline phase of pristine In 2 O 3 nanostructures and In 2 O 3 -rGO nanocomposites.Technai G 20 high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) was used to analyze the crystallographic facets and crystal structures of the In 2 O 3 -rGO nanocomposites.The photocatalysts on the carbon-coated nickel grid was used for the HRTEM measurements.The Jeol JSM-7800 F Prime field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) was used for the morphology studies of the pristine In 2 O 3 nanostructures and In 2 O 3 -rGO nanocomposites.Raman spectroscopy measurements of the photocatalysts were performed with the HORIBA LabRAM HR Evolution system equipped with an Ar ion laser of 514 nm wavelength.The V o defects in In 2 O 3 nanostructures, and In 2 O 3 -rGO nanocomposites were explored by photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy measurements with a He-Cd laser (excitation wavelength of 325 nm).For Raman and PL measurements, the samples were prepared by drop-casting the photocatalysts solution (which was obtained after the ultrasonication of 3 mg of the photocatalysts in 3 ml of ethanol) on 0.5 0.5 cm 2 n-type silicon wafer.Additionally, to quantify the relative V o concentration, and chemical coupling in the photocatalysts, the XPS measurements of In 2 O 3 nanostructures, and In 2 O 3 -2 wt rGO nanocomposite were performed with Thermo Fisher Scientific Instruments, UK spectrometer.The Al K was used as an X-ray source with beam current of 6 mA and 12 kV.The optical properties of all the photocatalysts were investigated by ultra violet-visible (UV-VIS) spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer Lambda 1050).The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and linear transient current density measurements were carried out with the photoelectrochemical workstation (Zehner Zennium, PP 211) and threeelectrode assembly cell.The Pt wire was used as a counter electrode.The Ag/AgCl/saturated KCl, and sample coated on ITO substrate used as a reference electrode, and working electrode, respectively.0.5 M Na 2 SO 4 solution used as electrolyte solution during all photoelectrochemical measurements.A halogen lamp of power 100 mW/cm 2 was used to irradiate the working electrode during the photoelectrochemical measurements.The transient current density was measured at potential 1.0 V vs Ag/AgCl for all photocatalysts.The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed out over the frequency range of 100 mHz to 100 kHz at zero bias potential vs Ag/AgCl to investigate the charge transfer mechanism in the photocatalysts. The photocatalytic activity of catalysts for CO 2 reduction will be performed in a sealed photoreactor equipped with a 250 W mercury vapor lamp (wavelength 400-700 nm).Briefly, the experimental setup consists of a mass-flow controller to control the CO 2 feed into the quartz reactor with a temperature controller, magnetic stirrer, and gas chromatography.For each experiment, initially, CO 2 was purged for 30 min through the solution, containing 0.1 g of photocatalyst and 2 M NaOH in a quartz photoreactor.The resulting solution was magnetically stirred at 500 rpm, so that CO 2 was soluble in solution.The flow of CO 2 was maintained at 15 sccm by using the Alicat Scientific mass flow controller.Then, liquid as well as a gaseous sample were collected after 30 min.Thereafter, the mercury-vapor lamp was switched ON and both liquid and gaseous samples were collected after every 30 min.The liquid product was analyzed by 680 Clarus Perkin Elmer GCMS with FFAP (Nitroterepathalic acid modified polyethylene glycol) column and the gaseous product was analyzed through GC, NUCON 5765 equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) for H 2 gas and a flame ionization detector (FID) for CO and hydrocarbons.The whole experiments were carried out in a photoreactor at room temperature and atmospheric pressure."}]}}
