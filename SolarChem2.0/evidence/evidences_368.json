Fig.2(a) and (b) shows XRD patterns of the prepared Ca(5.0 wt.)/Ti x SiMCM-41 (x 0, 15, 35, and 50) powders.In Fig.1(a), a shape reflection peak corresponding to the (100) plane was observed at a low angle (2-2.5 2) in all Ca non-loaded Ti x SiMCM-41 (x 0, 15, 35, and 50) samples, highlighting the typical hexagonal SiMCM-41 structure29.On the other hand, this peak was absent in the Ca(5.0 wt.)/Ti 50 Si 50 MCM-41 sample after Caloading.Fortunately, the sign of a very small peak remained until 35 mol.Ti-insertion in the Ca(5.0 wt.)/Ti 35 Si 65 MCM-41 sample.This was attributed to the larger mesopores due to the insertion of many larger sized titanium ions than silicon ions into the SiMCM-41 framework.Eventually, the loaded calcium ions penetrated further into the pores, which led to pore clogging.In addition to the main reflection peak, three reflection peaks, which were indexed to the (1 1 0), (2 0 0) and (2 1 0) planes, were clearly visible at 3-7 2A in the XRD patterns of the Ca(5.0 wt.)/Ti 15 Si 85 MCM-41 sample.The presence of well-defined and intense XRD peaks indicates the excellent degree of ordering of the mesoporous molecular sieves.In addition, slight decreases in inter planar spacing d 1 0 0 with increasing Ti content were observed.This could be related to the probable incorporation of Ti atoms into the silica framework.Because the ionic radius of Ti 4 (0.068 nm) is larger than that of Si 4 (0.041 nm), the substitution of Si 4 with Ti 4 should invariably distort the geometry around Ti from an ideal tetrahedral coordination.No peaks assignable to CaO were observed in the high-angle region (figure not shown).Therefore, the metal ions are either dispersed atomically in the framework of TiSiMCM-41 or achieve amorphous form outside the framework.On the other hand, in wide angle range of Fig.1(b), the anatase TiO 2 tetragonal structured peaks were clearly observed in the Ca(5.0 wt.)/Ti 15 Si 85 MCM-41 sample.In the Ca(5.0 wt.)/Ti 50 Si 50 MCM-41 sample, however, the peaks disappeared and new some small peaks assigned to the perovskite cubic CaTiO 3 structure30 were observed.These results suggest that the loaded Ca ions exist in close proximity to the Ti ions.Fig. 3 presents the TEM images of the four samples, Ca(5.0 wt.)/SiMCM-41, Ca(5.0 wt.)/Ti 15 Si 85 MCM-41, Fig. 2.

Fig.2(a) and (b) shows XRD patterns of the prepared Ca(5.0 wt.)/Ti x SiMCM-41 (x 0, 15, 35, and 50) powders.In Fig.1(a), a shape reflection peak corresponding to the (100) plane was observed at a low angle (2-2.5 2) in all Ca non-loaded Ti x SiMCM-41 (x 0, 15, 35, and 50) samples, highlighting the typical hexagonal SiMCM-41 structure29.On the other hand, this peak was absent in the Ca(5.0 wt.)/Ti 50 Si 50 MCM-41 sample after Caloading.Fortunately, the sign of a very small peak remained until 35 mol.Ti-insertion in the Ca(5.0 wt.)/Ti 35 Si 65 MCM-41 sample.This was attributed to the larger mesopores due to the insertion of many larger sized titanium ions than silicon ions into the SiMCM-41 framework.Eventually, the loaded calcium ions penetrated further into the pores, which led to pore clogging.In addition to the main reflection peak, three reflection peaks, which were indexed to the (1 1 0), (2 0 0) and (2 1 0) planes, were clearly visible at 3-7 2A in the XRD patterns of the Ca(5.0 wt.)/Ti 15 Si 85 MCM-41 sample.The presence of well-defined and intense XRD peaks indicates the excellent degree of ordering of the mesoporous molecular sieves.In addition, slight decreases in inter planar spacing d 1 0 0 with increasing Ti content were observed.This could be related to the probable incorporation of Ti atoms into the silica framework.Because the ionic radius of Ti 4 (0.068 nm) is larger than that of Si 4 (0.041 nm), the substitution of Si 4 with Ti 4 should invariably distort the geometry around Ti from an ideal tetrahedral coordination.No peaks assignable to CaO were observed in the high-angle region (figure not shown).Therefore, the metal ions are either dispersed atomically in the framework of TiSiMCM-41 or achieve amorphous form outside the framework.On the other hand, in wide angle range of Fig.1(b), the anatase TiO 2 tetragonal structured peaks were clearly observed in the Ca(5.0 wt.)/Ti 15 Si 85 MCM-41 sample.In the Ca(5.0 wt.)/Ti 50 Si 50 MCM-41 sample, however, the peaks disappeared and new some small peaks assigned to the perovskite cubic CaTiO 3 structure30 were observed.These results suggest that the loaded Ca ions exist in close proximity to the Ti ions.Fig. 3 presents the TEM images of the four samples, Ca(5.0 wt.)/SiMCM-41, Ca(5.0 wt.)/Ti 15 Si 85 MCM-41, Fig. 2.
