The FE-SEM image shows that uniform CdS NSs with an average diameter of 140 nm were obtained with the assistance of surfactant PVP which can prevent the further growth and agglomeration of CdS NSs (Fig. 1a andb). 11The size of CdS NSs could be regulated by adjusting the initial concentration of PVP.With the increase of initial concentration of PVP from 2 mg ml A1 to 10 mg ml A1 , the average diameter of CdS NSs decreased from 300 nm to 80 nm (data not shown).Through the electrostatic self-assembly, the positive surface of the PEI-modied CdS NSs is covered by negative-charged GO nanosheets (Fig. 1c andd).The FE-SEM images reveal the noteworthy thin sheet texture of the spherical surface of the GOcoated CdS NSs, compared with clean surface of pristine CdS sphere exhibiting no any notable feature.Partial GO patch peeling off from the CdS NSs core surface and corrugation can be obviously noticed.It proves that the block sheets have indeed been successfully coated onto CdS NSs. The TEM image further shows that the two-dimensional GO sheet was clearly observed on the surface of CdS NSs and a close interfacial contact between CdS NSs and GO was established (Fig. 2a).Aer treatment with TiO 2 precursor followed by calcination process, the formed TiO 2 nanoparticles were tightly decorated onto the rGO sheets on the CdS NSs, making the surface rough (Fig. 1e).The corresponding EDX demonstrates the presence of CdS and TiO 2 (Fig. 1f).The TEM image clearly shows that CdS and TiO 2 were distinctly interlayed with rGO sheets (Fig. 2b).The measured interplanar spacing of 0.352 nm and 0.316 nm corresponds to (101) lattice planes of TiO 2 and the (101) lattice plane of CdS (Fig. 2b), respectively. The XRD diffraction pattern of the pristine CdS NSs shows that all of the diffraction peaks match well to a hexagonal CdS phase (Fig. S2 ).The Raman spectrum demonstrates that the presence of crystalline TiO 2 is evident from the strong low frequency E g mode at 144 cm A1 (Fig. S3 ).The resonant excitations at 300 cm A1 and 604 cm A1 correspond to the longitudinal optical (LO) phonon and the rst overtones of CdS NSs. 12 XPS spectra also verify the presence of TiO 2 and rGO in the CdS NSs/rGO/TiO 2 .Two typical peaks of Ti 2p located at approximately 459.3 and 465.1 eV correspond to the Ti 2p 3/2 and Ti 2p 1/2 binding energies which are attributed to the Ti 4 species (Fig. 3a). 12The high-resolution XPS spectra of C 1s can be divided into three smaller peaks (Fig. 3b), which can be assigned to the following functional groups: C-C (sp 2 C atoms), C-O (epoxy/hydroxyls) and O-CO (carboxyl). 13The peaks relating to oxygen-containing functional groups are of much lower intensities than those relating to C-C, which indicates the reduction of GO to RGO. 9 Fig. 4 present UV-vis absorption spectrum and photographs of the various photocatalysts.A sharp fundamental absorption edge rising at 520 nm can be The reason for the baseline increase of the spectra of rGOcoupled photocatalyts could be that the light which comes across the sample was prevented by rGO. The CO 2 photocatalytic activity of various photocatalysts was evaluated with UV-visible light illumination under CO 2 in the presence of water vapor (Fig. 5).During the photocatalytic reduction reactions, CO 2 was mainly reduced to methane (CH 4 ).The CH 4 generation rate of the pristine CdS NSs is measured about 0.021 mmol h A1 g A1 .Combination of CdS NSs with TiO 2 to form CdS/TiO 2 heterostructure increases the CH 4 generation rate by 40, which is ascribed to spatial separation of electrons and holes between two components.Furthermore, coupling the CdS NSs with rGO makes apparent increase of CH 4 evolution by 3 times compared to the pristine CdS NSs.It demonstrates that the rapid electron transfer from the excited CdS NSs to rGO allows quick separation of electron and hole to improve the photocatalytic activity.Meanwhile, the photocatalytic activity of the CdS NSs/rGO/TiO 2 remarkably increases by 3 times compared to CdS NSs/TiO 2 .It also means that the presence of rGO greatly overcomes the limitation of CdS and TiO 2 interparticulate transfer of populated electrons and holes, thus resulting in much improvement in the photocatalytic activity.A CO 2 reduction cycle on the same CdS NSs/rGO/TiO 2 catalyst shows 10 decrease of CH 4 generation velocity (Fig. S4 ).The rate decrease may be due to the deactivation of the surface catalytic sites of the photocatalyst, possibly resulting from covering of the reduced carbon species.The generation rate ratio of O 2 to CH 4 over CdS NSs/rGO/TiO 2 is 1.7 : 1, close to the theoretical mole ratio of 2 : 1 (CO 2 2H 2 O / CH 4 2O 2 ).No nitrogen was detected in the reaction system (Fig. S5 ), which eliminates the possibility of origination of oxygen from the ambient atmosphere.A CO 2 reduction experiment performed in the dark or in the absence of the photocatalysts showed no appearance of CH 4 production, proving that the CO 2 reduction reaction is driven by light with the photocatalysts.No methane can be detected when high purity of N 2 gas instead of CO 2 was injected into the reaction system, suggesting that CO 2 should be the source of methane. The transient time-resolved photoluminescence decay measurements were carried out to investigate the charge transfers in above various photocatalysts (Fig. 6).Transient PL decay trace of the CdS NSs shows the PL lifetime of 0.28 ns.The PL decay time of CdS NSs/rGO decreases to 0.24 ns.It indicates that the conjugated rGO is efficient in interfacially extracting the photoelectrons from the present CdS NSs thereby to form an on-radiative transition pathway for the CdS NSs.The PL decay time of the CdS NSs/TiO 2 was measured to be 0.38 ns.The prolongation is believed to attribute to the form type-II heterostructure, in which the photogenerated electrons on the CB of CdS were transited to the CB of TiO 2 and the photogenerated holes on the VB of TiO 2 shi to the VB of CdS.While all above three samples display a single exponential decay behavior, on the contrary, the CdS NSs/rGO/TiO 2 shows a longer lifetime of 2.4 ns with biexponential decay behavior, suggesting the fundamentally different electron transfer mechanism from pristine CdS, CdS NSs/rGO, and CdS NSs/TiO 2 .Following Tada's mechanism of CdS/Au/TiO 2 Z-scheme, 5a we propose the charge-transfer process for the present CdS NSs/ rGO/TiO 2 system under UV visible-light irradiation, as schematically illustrated in Scheme 1.The excitation of the CdS and TiO 2 transiently produces electron-hole pairs with hot electrons at empty states above CB.As the CB edges of TiO 2 is negative than the Fermi level of rGO, the photo-generated electrons in the CB of TiO 2 prefer to shi to rGO.The transferring electron moves along the rGO to combine with the holes in the VB of CdS.This electron ow consumes the hole of CdS to suppress the electron of CdS to transfer to the ground state, thereby making the survive time of the electron on the CdS NSs increase by approximate an order of magnitude, relative to on the pristine CdS NSs.This mechanism accumulates holes in TiO 2 for oxidation of H 2 O and electrons in CdS for photoreduction of CO 2 , respectively.The depressed hole density on CdS may also enhance the stability of CdS against photocorrosion. 14"}], "lamp": [{"llm generation": "Xenon", "source": "In the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 , a 300 W xenon arc lamp was used as the light source at a distance of about 10 cm with cooling water and no other lters placed between the lamp and samples and the input optical power is approximately 50 W.", "context": "Preparation of CdS NSs/rGO/TiO 2 Z-scheme system Uniform CdS NSs were prepared by a simple hydrothermal method.In a typical synthesis, 0.5 mmol of cadmium acetate dehydrate Cd(CH 3 COO) 2 2H 2 O and 0.5 mmol of thiourea (NH 2 CSNH 2 ) were dissolved in 30 ml of deionized water containing 0.15 g of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP).Aer stirring for 30 min at room temperature, the solution was transferred into a Teon-lined stainless steel autoclave with 50 ml capacity and maintained at 120 C for 20 h.The nal products was separated and collected by centrifugation and washed several times with deionized water and dried by lyophilization.

The CO 2 photocatalytic activity of various photocatalysts was evaluated with UV-visible light illumination under CO 2 in the presence of water vapor (Fig. 5).During the photocatalytic reduction reactions, CO 2 was mainly reduced to methane (CH 4 ).The CH 4 generation rate of the pristine CdS NSs is measured about 0.021 mmol h A1 g A1 .Combination of CdS NSs with TiO 2 to form CdS/TiO 2 heterostructure increases the CH 4 generation rate by 40, which is ascribed to spatial separation of electrons and holes between two components.Furthermore, coupling the CdS NSs with rGO makes apparent increase of CH 4 evolution by 3 times compared to the pristine CdS NSs.It demonstrates that the rapid electron transfer from the excited CdS NSs to rGO allows quick separation of electron and hole to improve the photocatalytic activity.Meanwhile, the photocatalytic activity of the CdS NSs/rGO/TiO 2 remarkably increases by 3 times compared to CdS NSs/TiO 2 .It also means that the presence of rGO greatly overcomes the limitation of CdS and TiO 2 interparticulate transfer of populated electrons and holes, thus resulting in much improvement in the photocatalytic activity.A CO 2 reduction cycle on the same CdS NSs/rGO/TiO 2 catalyst shows 10 decrease of CH 4 generation velocity (Fig. S4 ).The rate decrease may be due to the deactivation of the surface catalytic sites of the photocatalyst, possibly resulting from covering of the reduced carbon species.The generation rate ratio of O 2 to CH 4 over CdS NSs/rGO/TiO 2 is 1.7 : 1, close to the theoretical mole ratio of 2 : 1 (CO 2 2H 2 O / CH 4 2O 2 ).No nitrogen was detected in the reaction system (Fig. S5 ), which eliminates the possibility of origination of oxygen from the ambient atmosphere.A CO 2 reduction experiment performed in the dark or in the absence of the photocatalysts showed no appearance of CH 4 production, proving that the CO 2 reduction reaction is driven by light with the photocatalysts.No methane can be detected when high purity of N 2 gas instead of CO 2 was injected into the reaction system, suggesting that CO 2 should be the source of methane. The transient time-resolved photoluminescence decay measurements were carried out to investigate the charge transfers in above various photocatalysts (Fig. 6).Transient PL decay trace of the CdS NSs shows the PL lifetime of 0.28 ns.The PL decay time of CdS NSs/rGO decreases to 0.24 ns.It indicates that the conjugated rGO is efficient in interfacially extracting the photoelectrons from the present CdS NSs thereby to form an on-radiative transition pathway for the CdS NSs.The PL decay time of the CdS NSs/TiO 2 was measured to be 0.38 ns.The prolongation is believed to attribute to the form type-II heterostructure, in which the photogenerated electrons on the CB of CdS were transited to the CB of TiO 2 and the photogenerated holes on the VB of TiO 2 shi to the VB of CdS.While all above three samples display a single exponential decay behavior, on the contrary, the CdS NSs/rGO/TiO 2 shows a longer lifetime of 2.4 ns with biexponential decay behavior, suggesting the fundamentally different electron transfer mechanism from pristine CdS, CdS NSs/rGO, and CdS NSs/TiO 2 .Following Tada's mechanism of CdS/Au/TiO 2 Z-scheme, 5a we propose the charge-transfer process for the present CdS NSs/ rGO/TiO 2 system under UV visible-light irradiation, as schematically illustrated in Scheme 1.The excitation of the CdS and TiO 2 transiently produces electron-hole pairs with hot electrons at empty states above CB.As the CB edges of TiO 2 is negative than the Fermi level of rGO, the photo-generated electrons in the CB of TiO 2 prefer to shi to rGO.The transferring electron moves along the rGO to combine with the holes in the VB of CdS.This electron ow consumes the hole of CdS to suppress the electron of CdS to transfer to the ground state, thereby making the survive time of the electron on the CdS NSs increase by approximate an order of magnitude, relative to on the pristine CdS NSs.This mechanism accumulates holes in TiO 2 for oxidation of H 2 O and electrons in CdS for photoreduction of CO 2 , respectively.The depressed hole density on CdS may also enhance the stability of CdS against photocorrosion. 14"}, {"llm generation": "Gas", "source": "An all-solid-state CdS NSs/rGO/TiO 2 Z-scheme system was rationally prepared for photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 into CH 4 .", "context": "An all-solid-state CdS NSs/rGO/TiO 2 Z-scheme system was rationally prepared for photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 into CH 4 .The Z-scheme with rGO interlayer as electron conductor leads to the more efficient separation of electron-hole pairs and exhibits remarkable enhancement relative to pure CdS NSs, CdS NSs/TiO 2 , and CdS NSs/rGO.The present work may provide a promising possibility of low-cost fabrication of complex Zscheme systems for high-efficiency articial photosynthesis.

CdS NSs/GO nanocomposites were obtained via electrostatic self-assembly. 9250 mg of CdS NSs and 0.5 g of polyethylenimine (PEI) were dispersed in 200 ml of deionized water at pH 9.0 under stirring to introduce positive charges to the surface of CdS NSs.The pH was adjusted by dilute hydrochloric acid or ammonia solutions.Then, the suspension was ultrasonically treated for 10 min.Aer further stirring for another 15 min, the PEI-coated CdS NSs was collected by centrifugation and washed several times to remove excess PEI.Aerward, the PEI-coated CdS NSs was dispersed in 200 ml of deionized water at pH 9.0.Aer another ultrasonic treatment, the colloidal suspension of negatively charged GO nanosheets at pH 9.0 was added drop wise to the suspension under stirring until the resultant products were sedimented due to the electrostatic attraction between the GO and CdS NSs.Finally, a centrifugation and washing process was carried out several times to remove the excess reactants and the nal products were dried by lyophilization.
