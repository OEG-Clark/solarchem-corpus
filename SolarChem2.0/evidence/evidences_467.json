The crystalline phase of the sample was identified by X-ray diffractometry (XRD) on an X'Pert PRO diffractometer using Cu Ka radiation (l 0.1542 nm) in the range of 10-808 with a step of 18 min A1 .The specific surface area was measured by nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms using a Micrometrics ASAP 2020 surface area and porosity analyzer.The inner structure of the catalyst was analyzed using a transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM, HR-TEM Tecnai G 2 F30).Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were obtained on a Bruker VERTEX 70 FT-IR spectrophotometer.X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurement (XPS) was carried out on a Shimadzu/KRATOS AXIS-ULTRA DLD-600W equipped with Al/Mg Ka radiation.Raman and photoluminescence spectra (PL) of the catalyst were recorded at room temperature on a confocal laser Raman microscope (Horiba JobinYvon, LabRAM HR800).A 325 nm He-Cd laser source was used to excite the material in the PL test. The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with water vapour under UV irradiation was carried out in a continuous-flow reactor at atmospheric pressure and in case of the condensation of water vapour in the reactor (as shown in Fig. 1).The system was mainly composed of an 85 ml self-made reactor, a 300 W Xe arc lamp positioned 10 cm above the reactor, and a gas chromatography (GC).The reactor has a stainless steel wall and a quartz window at the top.Catalyst powder was supported by a Petri plate placed on the bottom of the reactor.A 300 W Xe arc lamp was used as the light source and a liquid cooler was equipped to absorb the infrared portion of the light.The UV light irradiation (300 nm o l o 400 nm, 20.5 mW cm A2 ) was obtained by using a UV light reflector.In a typical photocatalytic reduction experiment, 10 mg of the catalysts were ultrasonically dispersed in 5 ml deionized water in a Petri plate (diameter, 35 mm) and then dried at 80 1C to evaporate water.The catalyst was deposited on the bottom of the Petri plate in the form of a thin film.Ultrapure CO 2 (99.999) passed through a water bubbler to generate a mixture of CO 2 and water vapour.Prior to illumination, the reactor was first purged with the CO 2 H 2 O mixture at a flow rate of 200 ml min A1 for 1 h and then 5 ml min A1 for another 30 min.After the flow was stabilized, the Xe lamp was switched on to start the experiment.The concentrations of H 2 , CO, and hydrocarbons in the exhaust gas were analyzed every 30 min by a GC equipped with an automated gas sampling valve, a flame ionization detector (FID), and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD).First, the effluents containing H 2 , O 2 , CH 4 , CO and CO 2 were preseparated by a carbon molecular sieve (TDX-01) column, and CO 2 was flushed back to remove from the GC.Then the effluents flowed through a molecular sieve 5A column for the separation of H 2 , O 2 , CH 4 , and CO.Finally, H 2 in the effluents were analyzed by the TCD detector and CH 4 and CO (converted to CH 4 by a methanizer) were analyzed by the FID detector.Ar was used as the carrier gas.The calibration with certified calibration gases (0.091 mol H 2 , 0.052 mol CH 4 , 0.048 mol CO, and CO 2 as the balance gas) was performed before each experimental run."}, {"llm generation": "G/TiO 2 -001/101 catalysts", "source": "On the basis of the above experimental results, a simple mechanism was proposed to explain the enhanced photocatalytic activity of G/TiO 2 -001/101 catalysts (Fig. 9).", "context": "Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of as-prepared catalysts.TiO 2 in all the samples existed as anatase and no peaks corresponding to rutile were observed.Meanwhile, no diffraction peaks for carbon species were observed in G/TiO 2 -001/101 samples, which might be due to the relatively low diffraction intensity of graphene.It is worth noting that for pure TiO 2 , the intensity of the TiO 2 characteristic peaks increased gradually and their shapes became sharper with the increasing amount of HF solution, indicating the increase of TiO 2 crystallinity. 18For G/TiO 2 -001/101 samples, the intensity of the (101) peak of anatase enhanced with the graphene content increased from 5 to 20, showing increased TiO 2 crystallinity.A similar phenomenon was also observed by Zhang et al. 10 The phenomenon can be explained that graphene may contribute to the adsorption of TiO 2 precursors and work as a substrate for the crystallization and growth of TiO 2 NCs. The FE-SEM images in Fig. S2 (ESI ) show the morphology of pure TiO 2 (A-C) and G/TiO 2 -001/101 samples (D-F).For pure TiO 2 samples, the particle size of TiO 2 crystals increased gradually and their shapes transformed from nanoparticles into nanosheets with increasing addition of HF solution, suggesting that HF has remarkable effect on the growth and transformation of TiO 2 NCs.For G/TiO 2 -001/101 samples, the plate-like structure in the image corresponds to graphene nanosheets and the small particles on it are TiO 2 NCs.When the graphene content is 5, some TiO 2 NCs are attached on graphene while some others are detached and agglomerated, due to the low amount of graphene in the composite.With the graphene content increased from 5 to 20, more TiO 2 NCs were uniformly coated on graphene nanosheets and fewer amounts of unattached TiO 2 agglomerates can be observed, which means good combination between TiO 2 and graphene. Considering that the resolution of FE-SEM is not high enough to character the shape and facet characteristics of TiO 2 NCs, TEM and HR-TEM were used to analyse the fine structure of the catalysts (as shown in Fig. 3).It is well known that natural anatase is a truncated tetragonal bipyramidal enclosed by eight 101 facets on sides and two 001 facets on the top and bottom. 18Among pure TiO 2 NCs, TiO 2 -101 is a truncated tetragonal bipyramidal (Fig. 3A), which is similar to the natural anatase.In the presence of HF, the truncated degree and the side length of TiO 2 NCs both obviously increase along with the amount of HF (Table 1).As a result, the TiO 2 -001 sample synthesized by adding 4.8 ml of HF solution are nanosheets, which have longer sides and thinner thickness (Fig. 3E), indicating the increase of crystallization and the formation of larger crystallites.This is in line with the results of XRD and FE-SEM.The HR-TEM images (Fig. 3C) revealed that the lattice spacing parallel to the top and bottom facets of the TiO 2 crystal is 0.20 nm, which indicates the top and bottom facets are (001) planes.Fig. 3C shows clear atomic planes with a lattice spacing of 0.35 nm, corresponding to the (101) planes of anatase TiO 2 . 22The shape change of the TiO 2 NCs also causes the increase of the percentage of exposed 001 facets (Table 1), indicating that F A can promote the formation of TiO 2 nanosheets with high percentage of exposed 001 facets.The percentage of exposed 001 facets was calculated based on the method reported in ref. 18. For G/TiO 2 -001/101 samples (Fig. 3F-I), the TiO 2 NCs with coexposed 001 and 101 facets were homogeneously dispersed on graphene nanosheets.The particle size of TiO 2 NCs on graphene is larger than that of pure TiO 2 NCs, indicating that the support of graphene contributes to the growth of TiO 2 NCs, which can be responsible for the higher intensity of TiO 2 XRD peaks of G/TiO 2 -001/101 samples.However, the increase of graphene content in the composites does not show obvious influence on the shape and size of TiO 2 NCs (Fig. 3F-I and Table 1), although XRD results show that increased graphene content can enhance the crystallinity of TiO 2 NCs, revealing that the content of graphene mainly affects the crystallinity of TiO 2 but not the size and shape of TiO 2 NCs.In addition, the TiO 2 -001/101 NCs attached on the graphene sheet have much better dispersion than that of pure TiO 2 -001/101 NCs, resulting from the intimate interaction between the hydrophilic function groups (e.g., -OH, -COOH) on GO and the hydroxyl groups on TiO 2 . 13This interaction helps the electron transfer from TiO 2 to graphene during the photoexcitation process. N 2 adsorption-desorption was applied to explore the textual properties of the prepared catalyst.The specific surface area, S BET was calculated according to the classical Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) theory and summarized in Table 2.It is obvious that the surface area of pure TiO 2 NCs decreased with the adding content of HF solution, which may be due to the larger crystallite size, as evident in the results of XRD and TEM.In addition, the surface areas of all graphene/TiO 2 composites are higher than pure TiO 2 NCs and increases with the increasing content of graphene.This is due to the extremely high surface area of graphene (theoretical value of 2600 m 2 g A1 ). 13 Fig. 4 shows the FTIR spectra of GO and 10 G/ TiO 2 -001/101.The broad peak at 3000-3500 cm A1 corresponds to the stretching vibrations of -OH and/or the physically adsorbed H 2 O on the catalyst. 23The peak at 1729 cm A1 is attributed to the CQO stretching vibration. 24The peaks at 1625 cm A1 , 1220 cm A1 ,and 1050 cm A1 are ascribed to CQC, C-O-C, and C-O stretching modes, respectively. 12Furthermore, the peak at 1570 cm A1 in the spectrum of 10 G/TiO 2 -001/101 is caused by the skeletal vibration of GO. 23 Raman spectroscopy is a powerful and nondestructive tool to characterize the crystalline phase of TiO 2 and the quality of graphene.Fig. 5 shows the Raman spectra of TiO 2 -001/101, GO, and G/TiO 2 -001/101 composites containing different amounts of graphene.For TiO 2 -001/101 and G/TiO 2 -001/101 composites, several characteristic bands at 146, 397, 516, and 637 cm A1 are attributed to the E g(1) , B 1g(1) , A 1g B 1g (2) , and E g(2) modes of anatase TiO 2 , respectively. 9Notably, the peak corresponding to the E g mode for the G/TiO 2 -001/101 composites is significantly red-shifted comparing to the TiO 2 -001/101 sample (Fig. 5, inset).It was reported that the shift of the Raman peak can be attributed to the strain developed on the G/ TiO 2 -001/101 surface and the phonon confinement effect because of the change in the crystal size of materials. 25In our work, the red shift of the E g peak indicates the larger crystal sizes of G/TiO 2 -001/101 composites than TiO 2 -001/101 samples. 26This is in line with the results of XRD and TEM, indicating a strong interaction between TiO 2 and graphene. The significant structural changes in GO during the solvothermal reaction process can also be reflected in the Raman spectra.There are two typical Raman bands, the D peak centered at 1346 cm A1 and the G peak at 1587 cm A1 , 24 found in GO and the composites.The former is common for disordered sp 2 carbon and the latter is due to the in-plane stretching motion of symmetric sp 2 C-C bonds.The composite showed an increased D/G intensity ratio comparing to GO, which indicates a decrease in the average size of the in-plane sp 2 domains of C atoms in the composite, 27 confirming the existence of graphene sheets in the G/TiO 2 -001/101 composites. 9,28n order to investigate the surface composition and the interaction between TiO 2 and graphene in G/TiO 2 -001/101 composites, the XPS spectra of TiO 2 -001/101 and G/TiO 2 -001/101 composites were recorded and are shown in Fig. 6.As shown in Fig. 6A, there are two peaks in the binding energy region of Ti 2p.The binding energy of Ti 2p 3/2 for each sample is around 459.4 eV, suggesting a normal state of Ti 4 in the TiO 2 . 29,30Comparing to the peak position of the TiO 2 -001/101 sample, the peaks of G/TiO 2 -001/101 composites show a shift to higher binding energy values.This phenomenon is most obvious in the 20G/TiO 2 -001/101 sample containing the largest amount of graphene.Similar results were reported elsewhere. 10The positive shift of Ti 2p spectra can be attributed to the strong interactions at interfaces between TiO 2 and graphene, resulting in the formation of electron transfer channels, 10,21 which benefits the transfer of excited electrons from the conduction band of TiO 2 to graphene during the photocatalytic process.Undoubtedly, this will enhance the photocatalytic activity of G/TiO 2 -001/101 composites. Fig. 6B shows the O 1s XPS spectra of TiO 2 -001/101 and G/TiO 2 -001/101 composites.The peaks at around 530.6 and 532.5 eV can be attributed to the lattice oxygen (Ti-O-Ti) of TiO 2 and the surface hydroxyl of TiO 2 and graphene, respectively. 12Similar to the Ti 2p spectra, a positive shift of the Ti-O-Ti peaks for G/TiO 2 -001/101 composites is also observed comparing to TiO 2 -001/101, which further proves the electron transfer between TiO 2 and graphene, resulting from their strong interactions. The C 1s XPS spectra of GO, RGO and G/TiO 2 -001/101 composites are exhibited in Fig. 6C.There are three peaks in the spectra of G/TiO 2 -001/101 composites, which are centered at around 284.5, 285.6, and 286.7 eV, respectively.The peak at 284.5 eV is assigned to the C-C, CQC, and C-H bonds in graphene, 12 and the peaks at 285.8 and 286.7 eV are attributed to the C-O and CQO bonds in graphene. 8Comparing to the XPS spectrum of GO, a negative shift of the C 1s peaks of G/TiO 2 -001/101 samples can also be observed, again demonstrating the electron transfer from TiO 2 to graphene.It is worth noting that the intensity of oxygen-containing functional groups of RGO and G/TiO 2 -001/101 samples decreased obviously, demonstrating that GO has been converted to graphene.This is in line with the results of FTIR that GO was partially reduced to graphene through the solvothermal process.The reduction of GO during the solvothermal synthesis of TiO 2 /graphene composites has been reported before, 26,31 which can be attributed to the reduction of GO by solvent 32 and/or the reaction between the Ti-containing intermediate and the graphene surface, leading to the covalent attachment of TiO 2 . 31The formation of C-O-Ti bonds may involve the reaction of TiO 2 with oxygen-containing groups on the surface of graphene, such as COOH and CQO groups. 31,33The reaction of TiO 2 intermediates with these groups can account for the low contents of oxygen-containing groups found in the G/TiO 2 -001/101 samples. The fluorescence of the semiconductor is caused by the recombination of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs, thus the PL spectra have been widely used to investigate the recombination rate of electron-hole pairs in the semiconductor.As shown in Fig. 7A, the fluorescence intensity of TiO 2 -001/101 is the lowest among the pure TiO 2 NCs, indicating that the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs can be suppressed by optimizing the ratio of 001 and 101 facets.This is due to the appropriate ratio of 001 and 101 facets can enhance the spatial separation of photogenerated electrons and holes.However, the higher percentage of exposed 001 facets can work as recombination centers and inhibit the separation of charges. 18When TiO 2 NCs were deposited onto graphene, the fluorescence intensity of G/TiO 2 -001/101 dramatically decreased, indicating that graphene can further restrain the recombination of photogenerated electronhole pairs on TiO 2 NCs due to the transfer of photogenerated electrons from TiO 2 to graphene. 34This result is consistent with the results of XPS.With the ratio of graphene increased from 5 to 20, the PL intensity of G/TiO 2 -001/101 becomes even lower.Fig. 7B further shows that the PL intensity of G/TiO 2 -001/101 catalysts at 550 nm depends linearly on the TiO 2 content in the composites, demonstrating that with the grapheme content increased from 5 to 20, the decreased PL intensity of G/TiO 2 -001/101 is mainly caused by the decreasing TiO 2 content in the composites.The electron transfer from TiO 2 to graphene in G/TiO 2 -001/101 samples is not obviously accelerated with the graphene content increased from 5 to 20. Before the experiment, a series of background tests were conducted to confirm that any carbon-containing compounds in the effluent gas measured by the GC indeed originated from CO 2 through photocatalytic reactions.First, tests were conducted using CO 2 and water vapor as the purging and reaction gases: (1) empty reactor and (2) reactor with a Petri plate but no catalyst in it.No carboncontaining compounds were detected in the dark or under UV irradiation in these two cases.This demonstrated that the CO 2 reduction could not proceed without a photocatalyst.Second, Ar (instead of CO 2 ) and water vapor were used as the purging and reaction gases in the presence of a photocatalyst.No carboncontaining compounds were produced under UV irradiation.This indicated that the CO 2 was the only carbon source. CO and CH 4 were found to be the main photocatalytic products and no H 2 was detected, suggesting H 2 was involved in the reduction of CO 2 .Fig. 8 shows the CO and CH 4 yields of pure TiO 2 NCs and G/TiO 2 composites under the following reaction conditions: photocatalyst, 10 mg; reaction temperature, 120 1C; molar ratio of H 2 O/CO 2 , 0.21, light source, 300-400 nm; irradiation time, 4 h.Among the pure TiO 2 NCs enclosed by different facets, TiO 2 -001/101 has the highest photocatalytic activity, with a CO and CH 4 yield of 9.73 and 7.95 mmol g A1 h A1 (Fig. 8A), which are about 1.5 times and 3.4 times higher than that of TiO 2 -101, respectively.It is notable that although the surface area of TiO 2 -001/101 is smaller than that of TiO 2 -101, the specific activity of the former one is much higher than that of the latter one (as shown in Table 2), indicating that the enhanced activity is not caused by the surface area.Therefore, the high activity of TiO 2 -001/101 can be attributed to the low recombination rate of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, as evident in PL spectra.When the TiO 2 NCs are irradiated under UV light, the valence band (VB) electrons are excited to the CB, while the holes remain in the VB.For TiO 2 -101, most electrons and holes are easy to accumulate on the 101 facets due to the low percentage of 001 facets.As a result, the photogenerated electrons and holes easily recombine, leading to low conversion efficiency.For TiO 2 -001, the high percentage of 001 facets on the surface of TiO 2 may cause an electron overflow effect toward 101 facets, which makes it difficult for the electrons to migrate to 101 facets.As a result, the TiO 2 -001 has lower photocatalytic activity than TiO 2 -001/101.In the case of TiO 2 -001/101, it was reported that the coexposed 101 and 001 facets of anatase can form a ''surface heterojunction'' within TiO 2 particles, which is beneficial for the transfer of photogenerated electrons and holes to 101 and 001 facets, respectively. 18D'Arienzo et al. 35 further found that the concentration of trapped holes (O A centers) increases with the increase of the 001 surface area, while that of electron traps (Ti 3 centers) increases with the increase of the 101 surface area, indicating that the 101 facets act as the reductive sites, while the 001 facets are the oxidative sites.Namely, photogenerated electrons and holes are effectively separated.In addition, D'Arienzo et al. 35 reported that the concentration of photogenerated defects (Ti 3 ) over 101 facets is also important to the activity of TiO 2 , because Ti 3 can easily transfer trapped electrons to reactants, which can account for the higher activity of TiO 2 -101 than TiO 2 -001.While based on the highest activity of TiO 2 -001/101, it can be speculated that comparing to photogenerated defects, the formation of a ''surface heterojunction'' is a more significant reason for the enhanced activity of TiO 2 -001/101. When TiO 2 NCs were loaded on graphene, the photocatalytic activity of all the G/TiO 2 composites significantly increased compared to that of pure TiO 2 NCs no matter which facet is exposed (as shown in Fig. 8B).For example, the CO yield of 10G/TiO 2 -101 and 10G/TiO 2 -001 are 41.0 and 28.0 mmol g A1 h A1 , which are about 6.2 and 6.5 times higher than that of TiO 2 -001 and TiO 2 -001, respectively.Considering that graphene has no photocatalytic activity, the reason for the enhanced activity is that the support of graphene facilitates the electron migration from the 101 or 001 facets of TiO 2 to graphene so that the recombination of electrons and holes is restrained.In addition, the enhanced surface area of G/TiO 2 composites and good dispersion of TiO 2 NCs on graphene can also contribute to the high activity of G/TiO 2 composites.It is notable that the CO and CH 4 yield of 10G/TiO 2 -101/001 is 70.8 and 27.4 mmol g A1 h A1 , respectively, which are both higher than those of 10G/TiO 2 -101 (57.4 and 17.2 mmol g A1 h A1 ) and 10G/TiO 2 -001 samples (28.0 and 9.0 mmol g A1 h A1 ).Based on the results of pure TiO 2 NCs, this demonstrates that the spatial separation of photogenerated charge carriers on TiO 2 NCs still have obvious influence on the activity of G/TiO 2 composites.In other words, the photogenerated electrons and holes on TiO 2 NCs can first separate from each other by migrating to different facets, and then the electrons on 101 facets are able to transfer to graphene, thus the photogenerated electron-hole pairs are more effectively separated, resulting in enhanced photocatalytic activity of the G/TiO 2 -101/001 catalyst. The effect of graphene amount on the activity was also investigated (Fig. 8B).The photocatalytic activity of G/TiO 2 -001/ 101 composites increased with the graphene amount increasing from 5 to 10.This can be attributed to the increased surface area caused by the increasing graphene amount.However, the photocatalytic activity of G/TiO 2 -001/101 composites decreased when the graphene amount increased to 20 even though the recombination rate of photogenerated charges is still decreasing.This may be caused by decreased content of TiO 2 , which is the active component in the composites. The selectivity of CO 2 reduction into CO and CH 4 has been discussed in various papers. 36,37Eight electrons and eight protons are needed to generate one molecular CH 4 while the formation of one molecular CO only requires two electrons and two protons.Therefore, enough supply of electrons and protons benefits the production of CH 4 . 3637738 In this study, the enhancement of CH 4 yield of TiO 2 -001/101 (comparing to TiO 2 -101) is more evident than that of CO.This can be explained by the high density of electrons on the 101 facets of TiO 2 -001/101, resulting from its effective separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs and decreased exposed area of 101 facets.Different from the effect of co-exposure of 101 and 001 facets, the support of graphene obviously enhanced the production of CO.A possible explanation is that excited electrons on G/TiO 2 -001/101 samples prefer to transfer to graphene and thus, CO 2 reduction reaction mainly happens on the surface of graphene.However, the adsorption of water on graphene was suppressed due to large amounts of oxygencontaining groups on graphene were removed during the solvothermal process.Thus, the supply of protons was not enough for the generation of CH 4 , resulting in preferred production of CO.Quantum efficiency of the CO 2 photocatalytic conversion on pure TiO 2 NCs and G/TiO 2 -001/101 samples was calculated by the following equations 39 and listed in Table 2.For TiO 2 -001/101, the quantum efficiency was calculated to be 0.0077 and 0.0250 for CO and CH 4 , respectively, and the total quantum efficiency was 0.0327 for CO 2 photocatalytic reduction. For 10G/TiO 2 -001/101 catalysts, the quantum efficiency was calculated to be 0.0557 and 0.0864 for CH 4 and CO, respectively, and the total quantum efficiency was 0.142 for CO 2 photocatalytic reduction, which is much higher than that of TiO 2 -001/101.The high photocatalytic activity of the G/TiO 2 -001/101 catalysts could be ascribed to the high surface area, good dispersion of TiO 2 NCs on graphene, and low recombination rate of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs. On the basis of the above experimental results, a simple mechanism was proposed to explain the enhanced photocatalytic activity of G/TiO 2 -001/101 catalysts (Fig. 9).When the catalyst was irradiated by UV light, the photogenerated electrons on TiO 2 NCs tend to transfer to the 101 facets while the excited holes prefer to the 001 facets.Thus, the spatial separation of photogenerated charges on TiO 2 NCs is achieved.Then the electrons accumulated on 101 facets can migrate to graphene due to the high work function of graphene. 40Consequently, the photogenerated electron-hole pairs are more effectively separated.Finally, the CO 2 reacts with the electrons on graphene to generate hydrocarbons and meanwhile, H 2 O was oxidized to O 2 by the holes on the TiO 2 NCs.In a word, the synergy of graphene supports and co-exposure of different facets results in the enhanced photocatalytic activity of G/TiO 2 -001/101 catalysts."}, {"llm generation": "G/TiO2-001/101", "source": "CO and CH 4 were found to be the main products for G/TiO 2 -001/101 catalysts and appropriate 001/101 facets ratio can enhance the CO and CH 4 yields of TiO 2 NCs, especially the CH 4 yield was tripled, which can be attributed to the surface heterojunction.", "context": "This work reports a one-pot solvothermal synthesis of graphene supported TiO 2 crystals with exposed 001 and 101 facets and their enhanced photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction.During the solvothermal reaction, graphene oxide was reduced and TiO 2 nanocrystals with coexposed 001 and 101 facets were uniformly loaded on graphene.The ratio of 001/101 facets can be controlled by the addition of HF solution.The supporting of graphene could improve the crystallinity and dispersion of TiO 2 NCs and increased the surface area.The surface heterojunction formed by the coexposed 001 and 101 facets can promote the spatial separation of photogenerated charges toward different facets of TiO 2 crystals, meanwhile, the supporting of graphene can facilitate the electron migration from TiO 2 to graphene, further accelerating the separation of photogenerated charges.CO and CH 4 were found to be the main products for G/TiO 2 -001/101 catalysts and appropriate 001/101 facets ratio can enhance the CO and CH 4 yields of TiO 2 NCs, especially the CH 4 yield was tripled, which can be attributed to the surface heterojunction.Appropriate amount of graphene in the catalyst can effectively improve the CO yield while an excess of graphene reverses the effect.The maximum CO and CH 4 yields of 70.8 and 27.4 mmol g A1 h A1 were obtained by 10G/TiO 2 -001/101.The enhanced photocatalytic activity of G/TiO 2 -001/101 catalysts can be attributed to its high surface area, good dispersion of TiO 2 NCs, and effective separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, resulting from the synergy of graphene supporting and co-exposure of 001 and 101 facets.

The FE-SEM images in Fig. S2 (ESI ) show the morphology of pure TiO 2 (A-C) and G/TiO 2 -001/101 samples (D-F).For pure TiO 2 samples, the particle size of TiO 2 crystals increased gradually and their shapes transformed from nanoparticles into nanosheets with increasing addition of HF solution, suggesting that HF has remarkable effect on the growth and transformation of TiO 2 NCs.For G/TiO 2 -001/101 samples, the plate-like structure in the image corresponds to graphene nanosheets and the small particles on it are TiO 2 NCs.When the graphene content is 5, some TiO 2 NCs are attached on graphene while some others are detached and agglomerated, due to the low amount of graphene in the composite.With the graphene content increased from 5 to 20, more TiO 2 NCs were uniformly coated on graphene nanosheets and fewer amounts of unattached TiO 2 agglomerates can be observed, which means good combination between TiO 2 and graphene. Considering that the resolution of FE-SEM is not high enough to character the shape and facet characteristics of TiO 2 NCs, TEM and HR-TEM were used to analyse the fine structure of the catalysts (as shown in Fig. 3).It is well known that natural anatase is a truncated tetragonal bipyramidal enclosed by eight 101 facets on sides and two 001 facets on the top and bottom. 18Among pure TiO 2 NCs, TiO 2 -101 is a truncated tetragonal bipyramidal (Fig. 3A), which is similar to the natural anatase.In the presence of HF, the truncated degree and the side length of TiO 2 NCs both obviously increase along with the amount of HF (Table 1).As a result, the TiO 2 -001 sample synthesized by adding 4.8 ml of HF solution are nanosheets, which have longer sides and thinner thickness (Fig. 3E), indicating the increase of crystallization and the formation of larger crystallites.This is in line with the results of XRD and FE-SEM.The HR-TEM images (Fig. 3C) revealed that the lattice spacing parallel to the top and bottom facets of the TiO 2 crystal is 0.20 nm, which indicates the top and bottom facets are (001) planes.Fig. 3C shows clear atomic planes with a lattice spacing of 0.35 nm, corresponding to the (101) planes of anatase TiO 2 . 22The shape change of the TiO 2 NCs also causes the increase of the percentage of exposed 001 facets (Table 1), indicating that F A can promote the formation of TiO 2 nanosheets with high percentage of exposed 001 facets.The percentage of exposed 001 facets was calculated based on the method reported in ref. 18. For G/TiO 2 -001/101 samples (Fig. 3F-I), the TiO 2 NCs with coexposed 001 and 101 facets were homogeneously dispersed on graphene nanosheets.The particle size of TiO 2 NCs on graphene is larger than that of pure TiO 2 NCs, indicating that the support of graphene contributes to the growth of TiO 2 NCs, which can be responsible for the higher intensity of TiO 2 XRD peaks of G/TiO 2 -001/101 samples.However, the increase of graphene content in the composites does not show obvious influence on the shape and size of TiO 2 NCs (Fig. 3F-I and Table 1), although XRD results show that increased graphene content can enhance the crystallinity of TiO 2 NCs, revealing that the content of graphene mainly affects the crystallinity of TiO 2 but not the size and shape of TiO 2 NCs.In addition, the TiO 2 -001/101 NCs attached on the graphene sheet have much better dispersion than that of pure TiO 2 -001/101 NCs, resulting from the intimate interaction between the hydrophilic function groups (e.g., -OH, -COOH) on GO and the hydroxyl groups on TiO 2 . 13This interaction helps the electron transfer from TiO 2 to graphene during the photoexcitation process. N 2 adsorption-desorption was applied to explore the textual properties of the prepared catalyst.The specific surface area, S BET was calculated according to the classical Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) theory and summarized in Table 2.It is obvious that the surface area of pure TiO 2 NCs decreased with the adding content of HF solution, which may be due to the larger crystallite size, as evident in the results of XRD and TEM.In addition, the surface areas of all graphene/TiO 2 composites are higher than pure TiO 2 NCs and increases with the increasing content of graphene.This is due to the extremely high surface area of graphene (theoretical value of 2600 m 2 g A1 ). 13 Fig. 4 shows the FTIR spectra of GO and 10 G/ TiO 2 -001/101.The broad peak at 3000-3500 cm A1 corresponds to the stretching vibrations of -OH and/or the physically adsorbed H 2 O on the catalyst. 23The peak at 1729 cm A1 is attributed to the CQO stretching vibration. 24The peaks at 1625 cm A1 , 1220 cm A1 ,and 1050 cm A1 are ascribed to CQC, C-O-C, and C-O stretching modes, respectively. 12Furthermore, the peak at 1570 cm A1 in the spectrum of 10 G/TiO 2 -001/101 is caused by the skeletal vibration of GO. 23 Raman spectroscopy is a powerful and nondestructive tool to characterize the crystalline phase of TiO 2 and the quality of graphene.Fig. 5 shows the Raman spectra of TiO 2 -001/101, GO, and G/TiO 2 -001/101 composites containing different amounts of graphene.For TiO 2 -001/101 and G/TiO 2 -001/101 composites, several characteristic bands at 146, 397, 516, and 637 cm A1 are attributed to the E g(1) , B 1g(1) , A 1g B 1g (2) , and E g(2) modes of anatase TiO 2 , respectively. 9Notably, the peak corresponding to the E g mode for the G/TiO 2 -001/101 composites is significantly red-shifted comparing to the TiO 2 -001/101 sample (Fig. 5, inset).It was reported that the shift of the Raman peak can be attributed to the strain developed on the G/ TiO 2 -001/101 surface and the phonon confinement effect because of the change in the crystal size of materials. 25In our work, the red shift of the E g peak indicates the larger crystal sizes of G/TiO 2 -001/101 composites than TiO 2 -001/101 samples. 26This is in line with the results of XRD and TEM, indicating a strong interaction between TiO 2 and graphene. The significant structural changes in GO during the solvothermal reaction process can also be reflected in the Raman spectra.There are two typical Raman bands, the D peak centered at 1346 cm A1 and the G peak at 1587 cm A1 , 24 found in GO and the composites.The former is common for disordered sp 2 carbon and the latter is due to the in-plane stretching motion of symmetric sp 2 C-C bonds.The composite showed an increased D/G intensity ratio comparing to GO, which indicates a decrease in the average size of the in-plane sp 2 domains of C atoms in the composite, 27 confirming the existence of graphene sheets in the G/TiO 2 -001/101 composites. 9,28n order to investigate the surface composition and the interaction between TiO 2 and graphene in G/TiO 2 -001/101 composites, the XPS spectra of TiO 2 -001/101 and G/TiO 2 -001/101 composites were recorded and are shown in Fig. 6.As shown in Fig. 6A, there are two peaks in the binding energy region of Ti 2p.The binding energy of Ti 2p 3/2 for each sample is around 459.4 eV, suggesting a normal state of Ti 4 in the TiO 2 . 29,30Comparing to the peak position of the TiO 2 -001/101 sample, the peaks of G/TiO 2 -001/101 composites show a shift to higher binding energy values.This phenomenon is most obvious in the 20G/TiO 2 -001/101 sample containing the largest amount of graphene.Similar results were reported elsewhere. 10The positive shift of Ti 2p spectra can be attributed to the strong interactions at interfaces between TiO 2 and graphene, resulting in the formation of electron transfer channels, 10,21 which benefits the transfer of excited electrons from the conduction band of TiO 2 to graphene during the photocatalytic process.Undoubtedly, this will enhance the photocatalytic activity of G/TiO 2 -001/101 composites. Fig. 6B shows the O 1s XPS spectra of TiO 2 -001/101 and G/TiO 2 -001/101 composites.The peaks at around 530.6 and 532.5 eV can be attributed to the lattice oxygen (Ti-O-Ti) of TiO 2 and the surface hydroxyl of TiO 2 and graphene, respectively. 12Similar to the Ti 2p spectra, a positive shift of the Ti-O-Ti peaks for G/TiO 2 -001/101 composites is also observed comparing to TiO 2 -001/101, which further proves the electron transfer between TiO 2 and graphene, resulting from their strong interactions. The C 1s XPS spectra of GO, RGO and G/TiO 2 -001/101 composites are exhibited in Fig. 6C.There are three peaks in the spectra of G/TiO 2 -001/101 composites, which are centered at around 284.5, 285.6, and 286.7 eV, respectively.The peak at 284.5 eV is assigned to the C-C, CQC, and C-H bonds in graphene, 12 and the peaks at 285.8 and 286.7 eV are attributed to the C-O and CQO bonds in graphene. 8Comparing to the XPS spectrum of GO, a negative shift of the C 1s peaks of G/TiO 2 -001/101 samples can also be observed, again demonstrating the electron transfer from TiO 2 to graphene.It is worth noting that the intensity of oxygen-containing functional groups of RGO and G/TiO 2 -001/101 samples decreased obviously, demonstrating that GO has been converted to graphene.This is in line with the results of FTIR that GO was partially reduced to graphene through the solvothermal process.The reduction of GO during the solvothermal synthesis of TiO 2 /graphene composites has been reported before, 26,31 which can be attributed to the reduction of GO by solvent 32 and/or the reaction between the Ti-containing intermediate and the graphene surface, leading to the covalent attachment of TiO 2 . 31The formation of C-O-Ti bonds may involve the reaction of TiO 2 with oxygen-containing groups on the surface of graphene, such as COOH and CQO groups. 31,33The reaction of TiO 2 intermediates with these groups can account for the low contents of oxygen-containing groups found in the G/TiO 2 -001/101 samples. The fluorescence of the semiconductor is caused by the recombination of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs, thus the PL spectra have been widely used to investigate the recombination rate of electron-hole pairs in the semiconductor.As shown in Fig. 7A, the fluorescence intensity of TiO 2 -001/101 is the lowest among the pure TiO 2 NCs, indicating that the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs can be suppressed by optimizing the ratio of 001 and 101 facets.This is due to the appropriate ratio of 001 and 101 facets can enhance the spatial separation of photogenerated electrons and holes.However, the higher percentage of exposed 001 facets can work as recombination centers and inhibit the separation of charges. 18When TiO 2 NCs were deposited onto graphene, the fluorescence intensity of G/TiO 2 -001/101 dramatically decreased, indicating that graphene can further restrain the recombination of photogenerated electronhole pairs on TiO 2 NCs due to the transfer of photogenerated electrons from TiO 2 to graphene. 34This result is consistent with the results of XPS.With the ratio of graphene increased from 5 to 20, the PL intensity of G/TiO 2 -001/101 becomes even lower.Fig. 7B further shows that the PL intensity of G/TiO 2 -001/101 catalysts at 550 nm depends linearly on the TiO 2 content in the composites, demonstrating that with the grapheme content increased from 5 to 20, the decreased PL intensity of G/TiO 2 -001/101 is mainly caused by the decreasing TiO 2 content in the composites.The electron transfer from TiO 2 to graphene in G/TiO 2 -001/101 samples is not obviously accelerated with the graphene content increased from 5 to 20. Before the experiment, a series of background tests were conducted to confirm that any carbon-containing compounds in the effluent gas measured by the GC indeed originated from CO 2 through photocatalytic reactions.First, tests were conducted using CO 2 and water vapor as the purging and reaction gases: (1) empty reactor and (2) reactor with a Petri plate but no catalyst in it.No carboncontaining compounds were detected in the dark or under UV irradiation in these two cases.This demonstrated that the CO 2 reduction could not proceed without a photocatalyst.Second, Ar (instead of CO 2 ) and water vapor were used as the purging and reaction gases in the presence of a photocatalyst.No carboncontaining compounds were produced under UV irradiation.This indicated that the CO 2 was the only carbon source. CO and CH 4 were found to be the main photocatalytic products and no H 2 was detected, suggesting H 2 was involved in the reduction of CO 2 .Fig. 8 shows the CO and CH 4 yields of pure TiO 2 NCs and G/TiO 2 composites under the following reaction conditions: photocatalyst, 10 mg; reaction temperature, 120 1C; molar ratio of H 2 O/CO 2 , 0.21, light source, 300-400 nm; irradiation time, 4 h.Among the pure TiO 2 NCs enclosed by different facets, TiO 2 -001/101 has the highest photocatalytic activity, with a CO and CH 4 yield of 9.73 and 7.95 mmol g A1 h A1 (Fig. 8A), which are about 1.5 times and 3.4 times higher than that of TiO 2 -101, respectively.It is notable that although the surface area of TiO 2 -001/101 is smaller than that of TiO 2 -101, the specific activity of the former one is much higher than that of the latter one (as shown in Table 2), indicating that the enhanced activity is not caused by the surface area.Therefore, the high activity of TiO 2 -001/101 can be attributed to the low recombination rate of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, as evident in PL spectra.When the TiO 2 NCs are irradiated under UV light, the valence band (VB) electrons are excited to the CB, while the holes remain in the VB.For TiO 2 -101, most electrons and holes are easy to accumulate on the 101 facets due to the low percentage of 001 facets.As a result, the photogenerated electrons and holes easily recombine, leading to low conversion efficiency.For TiO 2 -001, the high percentage of 001 facets on the surface of TiO 2 may cause an electron overflow effect toward 101 facets, which makes it difficult for the electrons to migrate to 101 facets.As a result, the TiO 2 -001 has lower photocatalytic activity than TiO 2 -001/101.In the case of TiO 2 -001/101, it was reported that the coexposed 101 and 001 facets of anatase can form a ''surface heterojunction'' within TiO 2 particles, which is beneficial for the transfer of photogenerated electrons and holes to 101 and 001 facets, respectively. 18D'Arienzo et al. 35 further found that the concentration of trapped holes (O A centers) increases with the increase of the 001 surface area, while that of electron traps (Ti 3 centers) increases with the increase of the 101 surface area, indicating that the 101 facets act as the reductive sites, while the 001 facets are the oxidative sites.Namely, photogenerated electrons and holes are effectively separated.In addition, D'Arienzo et al. 35 reported that the concentration of photogenerated defects (Ti 3 ) over 101 facets is also important to the activity of TiO 2 , because Ti 3 can easily transfer trapped electrons to reactants, which can account for the higher activity of TiO 2 -101 than TiO 2 -001.While based on the highest activity of TiO 2 -001/101, it can be speculated that comparing to photogenerated defects, the formation of a ''surface heterojunction'' is a more significant reason for the enhanced activity of TiO 2 -001/101. When TiO 2 NCs were loaded on graphene, the photocatalytic activity of all the G/TiO 2 composites significantly increased compared to that of pure TiO 2 NCs no matter which facet is exposed (as shown in Fig. 8B).For example, the CO yield of 10G/TiO 2 -101 and 10G/TiO 2 -001 are 41.0 and 28.0 mmol g A1 h A1 , which are about 6.2 and 6.5 times higher than that of TiO 2 -001 and TiO 2 -001, respectively.Considering that graphene has no photocatalytic activity, the reason for the enhanced activity is that the support of graphene facilitates the electron migration from the 101 or 001 facets of TiO 2 to graphene so that the recombination of electrons and holes is restrained.In addition, the enhanced surface area of G/TiO 2 composites and good dispersion of TiO 2 NCs on graphene can also contribute to the high activity of G/TiO 2 composites.It is notable that the CO and CH 4 yield of 10G/TiO 2 -101/001 is 70.8 and 27.4 mmol g A1 h A1 , respectively, which are both higher than those of 10G/TiO 2 -101 (57.4 and 17.2 mmol g A1 h A1 ) and 10G/TiO 2 -001 samples (28.0 and 9.0 mmol g A1 h A1 ).Based on the results of pure TiO 2 NCs, this demonstrates that the spatial separation of photogenerated charge carriers on TiO 2 NCs still have obvious influence on the activity of G/TiO 2 composites.In other words, the photogenerated electrons and holes on TiO 2 NCs can first separate from each other by migrating to different facets, and then the electrons on 101 facets are able to transfer to graphene, thus the photogenerated electron-hole pairs are more effectively separated, resulting in enhanced photocatalytic activity of the G/TiO 2 -101/001 catalyst. The effect of graphene amount on the activity was also investigated (Fig. 8B).The photocatalytic activity of G/TiO 2 -001/ 101 composites increased with the graphene amount increasing from 5 to 10.This can be attributed to the increased surface area caused by the increasing graphene amount.However, the photocatalytic activity of G/TiO 2 -001/101 composites decreased when the graphene amount increased to 20 even though the recombination rate of photogenerated charges is still decreasing.This may be caused by decreased content of TiO 2 , which is the active component in the composites. The selectivity of CO 2 reduction into CO and CH 4 has been discussed in various papers. 36,37Eight electrons and eight protons are needed to generate one molecular CH 4 while the formation of one molecular CO only requires two electrons and two protons.Therefore, enough supply of electrons and protons benefits the production of CH 4 . 3637738 In this study, the enhancement of CH 4 yield of TiO 2 -001/101 (comparing to TiO 2 -101) is more evident than that of CO.This can be explained by the high density of electrons on the 101 facets of TiO 2 -001/101, resulting from its effective separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs and decreased exposed area of 101 facets.Different from the effect of co-exposure of 101 and 001 facets, the support of graphene obviously enhanced the production of CO.A possible explanation is that excited electrons on G/TiO 2 -001/101 samples prefer to transfer to graphene and thus, CO 2 reduction reaction mainly happens on the surface of graphene.However, the adsorption of water on graphene was suppressed due to large amounts of oxygencontaining groups on graphene were removed during the solvothermal process.Thus, the supply of protons was not enough for the generation of CH 4 , resulting in preferred production of CO.Quantum efficiency of the CO 2 photocatalytic conversion on pure TiO 2 NCs and G/TiO 2 -001/101 samples was calculated by the following equations 39 and listed in Table 2.For TiO 2 -001/101, the quantum efficiency was calculated to be 0.0077 and 0.0250 for CO and CH 4 , respectively, and the total quantum efficiency was 0.0327 for CO 2 photocatalytic reduction. For 10G/TiO 2 -001/101 catalysts, the quantum efficiency was calculated to be 0.0557 and 0.0864 for CH 4 and CO, respectively, and the total quantum efficiency was 0.142 for CO 2 photocatalytic reduction, which is much higher than that of TiO 2 -001/101.The high photocatalytic activity of the G/TiO 2 -001/101 catalysts could be ascribed to the high surface area, good dispersion of TiO 2 NCs on graphene, and low recombination rate of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs. On the basis of the above experimental results, a simple mechanism was proposed to explain the enhanced photocatalytic activity of G/TiO 2 -001/101 catalysts (Fig. 9).When the catalyst was irradiated by UV light, the photogenerated electrons on TiO 2 NCs tend to transfer to the 101 facets while the excited holes prefer to the 001 facets.Thus, the spatial separation of photogenerated charges on TiO 2 NCs is achieved.Then the electrons accumulated on 101 facets can migrate to graphene due to the high work function of graphene. 40Consequently, the photogenerated electron-hole pairs are more effectively separated.Finally, the CO 2 reacts with the electrons on graphene to generate hydrocarbons and meanwhile, H 2 O was oxidized to O 2 by the holes on the TiO 2 NCs.In a word, the synergy of graphene supports and co-exposure of different facets results in the enhanced photocatalytic activity of G/TiO 2 -001/101 catalysts."}, {"llm generation": "graphene", "source": "The surface heterojunction formed by the coexposed 001 and 101 facets can promote the spatial separation of photogenerated charges toward different facets of TiO 2 crystals, meanwhile, the supporting of graphene can facilitate the electron migration from TiO 2 to graphene, further accelerating the separation of photogenerated charges.", "context": "This work reports a one-pot solvothermal synthesis of graphene supported TiO 2 crystals with exposed 001 and 101 facets and their enhanced photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction.During the solvothermal reaction, graphene oxide was reduced and TiO 2 nanocrystals with coexposed 001 and 101 facets were uniformly loaded on graphene.The ratio of 001/101 facets can be controlled by the addition of HF solution.The supporting of graphene could improve the crystallinity and dispersion of TiO 2 NCs and increased the surface area.The surface heterojunction formed by the coexposed 001 and 101 facets can promote the spatial separation of photogenerated charges toward different facets of TiO 2 crystals, meanwhile, the supporting of graphene can facilitate the electron migration from TiO 2 to graphene, further accelerating the separation of photogenerated charges.CO and CH 4 were found to be the main products for G/TiO 2 -001/101 catalysts and appropriate 001/101 facets ratio can enhance the CO and CH 4 yields of TiO 2 NCs, especially the CH 4 yield was tripled, which can be attributed to the surface heterojunction.Appropriate amount of graphene in the catalyst can effectively improve the CO yield while an excess of graphene reverses the effect.The maximum CO and CH 4 yields of 70.8 and 27.4 mmol g A1 h A1 were obtained by 10G/TiO 2 -001/101.The enhanced photocatalytic activity of G/TiO 2 -001/101 catalysts can be attributed to its high surface area, good dispersion of TiO 2 NCs, and effective separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, resulting from the synergy of graphene supporting and co-exposure of 001 and 101 facets.

The crystalline phase of the sample was identified by X-ray diffractometry (XRD) on an X'Pert PRO diffractometer using Cu Ka radiation (l 0.1542 nm) in the range of 10-808 with a step of 18 min A1 .The specific surface area was measured by nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms using a Micrometrics ASAP 2020 surface area and porosity analyzer.The inner structure of the catalyst was analyzed using a transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM, HR-TEM Tecnai G 2 F30).Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were obtained on a Bruker VERTEX 70 FT-IR spectrophotometer.X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurement (XPS) was carried out on a Shimadzu/KRATOS AXIS-ULTRA DLD-600W equipped with Al/Mg Ka radiation.Raman and photoluminescence spectra (PL) of the catalyst were recorded at room temperature on a confocal laser Raman microscope (Horiba JobinYvon, LabRAM HR800).A 325 nm He-Cd laser source was used to excite the material in the PL test. The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with water vapour under UV irradiation was carried out in a continuous-flow reactor at atmospheric pressure and in case of the condensation of water vapour in the reactor (as shown in Fig. 1).The system was mainly composed of an 85 ml self-made reactor, a 300 W Xe arc lamp positioned 10 cm above the reactor, and a gas chromatography (GC).The reactor has a stainless steel wall and a quartz window at the top.Catalyst powder was supported by a Petri plate placed on the bottom of the reactor.A 300 W Xe arc lamp was used as the light source and a liquid cooler was equipped to absorb the infrared portion of the light.The UV light irradiation (300 nm o l o 400 nm, 20.5 mW cm A2 ) was obtained by using a UV light reflector.In a typical photocatalytic reduction experiment, 10 mg of the catalysts were ultrasonically dispersed in 5 ml deionized water in a Petri plate (diameter, 35 mm) and then dried at 80 1C to evaporate water.The catalyst was deposited on the bottom of the Petri plate in the form of a thin film.Ultrapure CO 2 (99.999) passed through a water bubbler to generate a mixture of CO 2 and water vapour.Prior to illumination, the reactor was first purged with the CO 2 H 2 O mixture at a flow rate of 200 ml min A1 for 1 h and then 5 ml min A1 for another 30 min.After the flow was stabilized, the Xe lamp was switched on to start the experiment.The concentrations of H 2 , CO, and hydrocarbons in the exhaust gas were analyzed every 30 min by a GC equipped with an automated gas sampling valve, a flame ionization detector (FID), and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD).First, the effluents containing H 2 , O 2 , CH 4 , CO and CO 2 were preseparated by a carbon molecular sieve (TDX-01) column, and CO 2 was flushed back to remove from the GC.Then the effluents flowed through a molecular sieve 5A column for the separation of H 2 , O 2 , CH 4 , and CO.Finally, H 2 in the effluents were analyzed by the TCD detector and CH 4 and CO (converted to CH 4 by a methanizer) were analyzed by the FID detector.Ar was used as the carrier gas.The calibration with certified calibration gases (0.091 mol H 2 , 0.052 mol CH 4 , 0.048 mol CO, and CO 2 as the balance gas) was performed before each experimental run."}, {"llm generation": "UV (300-400 nm)", "source": "Fig. 8 shows the CO and CH 4 yields of pure TiO 2 NCs and G/TiO 2 composites under the following reaction conditions: photocatalyst, 10 mg; reaction temperature, 120 1C; molar ratio of H 2 O/CO 2 , 0.21, light source, 300-400 nm; irradiation time, 4 h.", "context": "Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of as-prepared catalysts.TiO 2 in all the samples existed as anatase and no peaks corresponding to rutile were observed.Meanwhile, no diffraction peaks for carbon species were observed in G/TiO 2 -001/101 samples, which might be due to the relatively low diffraction intensity of graphene.It is worth noting that for pure TiO 2 , the intensity of the TiO 2 characteristic peaks increased gradually and their shapes became sharper with the increasing amount of HF solution, indicating the increase of TiO 2 crystallinity. 18For G/TiO 2 -001/101 samples, the intensity of the (101) peak of anatase enhanced with the graphene content increased from 5 to 20, showing increased TiO 2 crystallinity.A similar phenomenon was also observed by Zhang et al. 10 The phenomenon can be explained that graphene may contribute to the adsorption of TiO 2 precursors and work as a substrate for the crystallization and growth of TiO 2 NCs. The FE-SEM images in Fig. S2 (ESI ) show the morphology of pure TiO 2 (A-C) and G/TiO 2 -001/101 samples (D-F).For pure TiO 2 samples, the particle size of TiO 2 crystals increased gradually and their shapes transformed from nanoparticles into nanosheets with increasing addition of HF solution, suggesting that HF has remarkable effect on the growth and transformation of TiO 2 NCs.For G/TiO 2 -001/101 samples, the plate-like structure in the image corresponds to graphene nanosheets and the small particles on it are TiO 2 NCs.When the graphene content is 5, some TiO 2 NCs are attached on graphene while some others are detached and agglomerated, due to the low amount of graphene in the composite.With the graphene content increased from 5 to 20, more TiO 2 NCs were uniformly coated on graphene nanosheets and fewer amounts of unattached TiO 2 agglomerates can be observed, which means good combination between TiO 2 and graphene. Considering that the resolution of FE-SEM is not high enough to character the shape and facet characteristics of TiO 2 NCs, TEM and HR-TEM were used to analyse the fine structure of the catalysts (as shown in Fig. 3).It is well known that natural anatase is a truncated tetragonal bipyramidal enclosed by eight 101 facets on sides and two 001 facets on the top and bottom. 18Among pure TiO 2 NCs, TiO 2 -101 is a truncated tetragonal bipyramidal (Fig. 3A), which is similar to the natural anatase.In the presence of HF, the truncated degree and the side length of TiO 2 NCs both obviously increase along with the amount of HF (Table 1).As a result, the TiO 2 -001 sample synthesized by adding 4.8 ml of HF solution are nanosheets, which have longer sides and thinner thickness (Fig. 3E), indicating the increase of crystallization and the formation of larger crystallites.This is in line with the results of XRD and FE-SEM.The HR-TEM images (Fig. 3C) revealed that the lattice spacing parallel to the top and bottom facets of the TiO 2 crystal is 0.20 nm, which indicates the top and bottom facets are (001) planes.Fig. 3C shows clear atomic planes with a lattice spacing of 0.35 nm, corresponding to the (101) planes of anatase TiO 2 . 22The shape change of the TiO 2 NCs also causes the increase of the percentage of exposed 001 facets (Table 1), indicating that F A can promote the formation of TiO 2 nanosheets with high percentage of exposed 001 facets.The percentage of exposed 001 facets was calculated based on the method reported in ref. 18. For G/TiO 2 -001/101 samples (Fig. 3F-I), the TiO 2 NCs with coexposed 001 and 101 facets were homogeneously dispersed on graphene nanosheets.The particle size of TiO 2 NCs on graphene is larger than that of pure TiO 2 NCs, indicating that the support of graphene contributes to the growth of TiO 2 NCs, which can be responsible for the higher intensity of TiO 2 XRD peaks of G/TiO 2 -001/101 samples.However, the increase of graphene content in the composites does not show obvious influence on the shape and size of TiO 2 NCs (Fig. 3F-I and Table 1), although XRD results show that increased graphene content can enhance the crystallinity of TiO 2 NCs, revealing that the content of graphene mainly affects the crystallinity of TiO 2 but not the size and shape of TiO 2 NCs.In addition, the TiO 2 -001/101 NCs attached on the graphene sheet have much better dispersion than that of pure TiO 2 -001/101 NCs, resulting from the intimate interaction between the hydrophilic function groups (e.g., -OH, -COOH) on GO and the hydroxyl groups on TiO 2 . 13This interaction helps the electron transfer from TiO 2 to graphene during the photoexcitation process. N 2 adsorption-desorption was applied to explore the textual properties of the prepared catalyst.The specific surface area, S BET was calculated according to the classical Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) theory and summarized in Table 2.It is obvious that the surface area of pure TiO 2 NCs decreased with the adding content of HF solution, which may be due to the larger crystallite size, as evident in the results of XRD and TEM.In addition, the surface areas of all graphene/TiO 2 composites are higher than pure TiO 2 NCs and increases with the increasing content of graphene.This is due to the extremely high surface area of graphene (theoretical value of 2600 m 2 g A1 ). 13 Fig. 4 shows the FTIR spectra of GO and 10 G/ TiO 2 -001/101.The broad peak at 3000-3500 cm A1 corresponds to the stretching vibrations of -OH and/or the physically adsorbed H 2 O on the catalyst. 23The peak at 1729 cm A1 is attributed to the CQO stretching vibration. 24The peaks at 1625 cm A1 , 1220 cm A1 ,and 1050 cm A1 are ascribed to CQC, C-O-C, and C-O stretching modes, respectively. 12Furthermore, the peak at 1570 cm A1 in the spectrum of 10 G/TiO 2 -001/101 is caused by the skeletal vibration of GO. 23 Raman spectroscopy is a powerful and nondestructive tool to characterize the crystalline phase of TiO 2 and the quality of graphene.Fig. 5 shows the Raman spectra of TiO 2 -001/101, GO, and G/TiO 2 -001/101 composites containing different amounts of graphene.For TiO 2 -001/101 and G/TiO 2 -001/101 composites, several characteristic bands at 146, 397, 516, and 637 cm A1 are attributed to the E g(1) , B 1g(1) , A 1g B 1g (2) , and E g(2) modes of anatase TiO 2 , respectively. 9Notably, the peak corresponding to the E g mode for the G/TiO 2 -001/101 composites is significantly red-shifted comparing to the TiO 2 -001/101 sample (Fig. 5, inset).It was reported that the shift of the Raman peak can be attributed to the strain developed on the G/ TiO 2 -001/101 surface and the phonon confinement effect because of the change in the crystal size of materials. 25In our work, the red shift of the E g peak indicates the larger crystal sizes of G/TiO 2 -001/101 composites than TiO 2 -001/101 samples. 26This is in line with the results of XRD and TEM, indicating a strong interaction between TiO 2 and graphene. The significant structural changes in GO during the solvothermal reaction process can also be reflected in the Raman spectra.There are two typical Raman bands, the D peak centered at 1346 cm A1 and the G peak at 1587 cm A1 , 24 found in GO and the composites.The former is common for disordered sp 2 carbon and the latter is due to the in-plane stretching motion of symmetric sp 2 C-C bonds.The composite showed an increased D/G intensity ratio comparing to GO, which indicates a decrease in the average size of the in-plane sp 2 domains of C atoms in the composite, 27 confirming the existence of graphene sheets in the G/TiO 2 -001/101 composites. 9,28n order to investigate the surface composition and the interaction between TiO 2 and graphene in G/TiO 2 -001/101 composites, the XPS spectra of TiO 2 -001/101 and G/TiO 2 -001/101 composites were recorded and are shown in Fig. 6.As shown in Fig. 6A, there are two peaks in the binding energy region of Ti 2p.The binding energy of Ti 2p 3/2 for each sample is around 459.4 eV, suggesting a normal state of Ti 4 in the TiO 2 . 29,30Comparing to the peak position of the TiO 2 -001/101 sample, the peaks of G/TiO 2 -001/101 composites show a shift to higher binding energy values.This phenomenon is most obvious in the 20G/TiO 2 -001/101 sample containing the largest amount of graphene.Similar results were reported elsewhere. 10The positive shift of Ti 2p spectra can be attributed to the strong interactions at interfaces between TiO 2 and graphene, resulting in the formation of electron transfer channels, 10,21 which benefits the transfer of excited electrons from the conduction band of TiO 2 to graphene during the photocatalytic process.Undoubtedly, this will enhance the photocatalytic activity of G/TiO 2 -001/101 composites. Fig. 6B shows the O 1s XPS spectra of TiO 2 -001/101 and G/TiO 2 -001/101 composites.The peaks at around 530.6 and 532.5 eV can be attributed to the lattice oxygen (Ti-O-Ti) of TiO 2 and the surface hydroxyl of TiO 2 and graphene, respectively. 12Similar to the Ti 2p spectra, a positive shift of the Ti-O-Ti peaks for G/TiO 2 -001/101 composites is also observed comparing to TiO 2 -001/101, which further proves the electron transfer between TiO 2 and graphene, resulting from their strong interactions. The C 1s XPS spectra of GO, RGO and G/TiO 2 -001/101 composites are exhibited in Fig. 6C.There are three peaks in the spectra of G/TiO 2 -001/101 composites, which are centered at around 284.5, 285.6, and 286.7 eV, respectively.The peak at 284.5 eV is assigned to the C-C, CQC, and C-H bonds in graphene, 12 and the peaks at 285.8 and 286.7 eV are attributed to the C-O and CQO bonds in graphene. 8Comparing to the XPS spectrum of GO, a negative shift of the C 1s peaks of G/TiO 2 -001/101 samples can also be observed, again demonstrating the electron transfer from TiO 2 to graphene.It is worth noting that the intensity of oxygen-containing functional groups of RGO and G/TiO 2 -001/101 samples decreased obviously, demonstrating that GO has been converted to graphene.This is in line with the results of FTIR that GO was partially reduced to graphene through the solvothermal process.The reduction of GO during the solvothermal synthesis of TiO 2 /graphene composites has been reported before, 26,31 which can be attributed to the reduction of GO by solvent 32 and/or the reaction between the Ti-containing intermediate and the graphene surface, leading to the covalent attachment of TiO 2 . 31The formation of C-O-Ti bonds may involve the reaction of TiO 2 with oxygen-containing groups on the surface of graphene, such as COOH and CQO groups. 31,33The reaction of TiO 2 intermediates with these groups can account for the low contents of oxygen-containing groups found in the G/TiO 2 -001/101 samples. The fluorescence of the semiconductor is caused by the recombination of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs, thus the PL spectra have been widely used to investigate the recombination rate of electron-hole pairs in the semiconductor.As shown in Fig. 7A, the fluorescence intensity of TiO 2 -001/101 is the lowest among the pure TiO 2 NCs, indicating that the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs can be suppressed by optimizing the ratio of 001 and 101 facets.This is due to the appropriate ratio of 001 and 101 facets can enhance the spatial separation of photogenerated electrons and holes.However, the higher percentage of exposed 001 facets can work as recombination centers and inhibit the separation of charges. 18When TiO 2 NCs were deposited onto graphene, the fluorescence intensity of G/TiO 2 -001/101 dramatically decreased, indicating that graphene can further restrain the recombination of photogenerated electronhole pairs on TiO 2 NCs due to the transfer of photogenerated electrons from TiO 2 to graphene. 34This result is consistent with the results of XPS.With the ratio of graphene increased from 5 to 20, the PL intensity of G/TiO 2 -001/101 becomes even lower.Fig. 7B further shows that the PL intensity of G/TiO 2 -001/101 catalysts at 550 nm depends linearly on the TiO 2 content in the composites, demonstrating that with the grapheme content increased from 5 to 20, the decreased PL intensity of G/TiO 2 -001/101 is mainly caused by the decreasing TiO 2 content in the composites.The electron transfer from TiO 2 to graphene in G/TiO 2 -001/101 samples is not obviously accelerated with the graphene content increased from 5 to 20. Before the experiment, a series of background tests were conducted to confirm that any carbon-containing compounds in the effluent gas measured by the GC indeed originated from CO 2 through photocatalytic reactions.First, tests were conducted using CO 2 and water vapor as the purging and reaction gases: (1) empty reactor and (2) reactor with a Petri plate but no catalyst in it.No carboncontaining compounds were detected in the dark or under UV irradiation in these two cases.This demonstrated that the CO 2 reduction could not proceed without a photocatalyst.Second, Ar (instead of CO 2 ) and water vapor were used as the purging and reaction gases in the presence of a photocatalyst.No carboncontaining compounds were produced under UV irradiation.This indicated that the CO 2 was the only carbon source. CO and CH 4 were found to be the main photocatalytic products and no H 2 was detected, suggesting H 2 was involved in the reduction of CO 2 .Fig. 8 shows the CO and CH 4 yields of pure TiO 2 NCs and G/TiO 2 composites under the following reaction conditions: photocatalyst, 10 mg; reaction temperature, 120 1C; molar ratio of H 2 O/CO 2 , 0.21, light source, 300-400 nm; irradiation time, 4 h.Among the pure TiO 2 NCs enclosed by different facets, TiO 2 -001/101 has the highest photocatalytic activity, with a CO and CH 4 yield of 9.73 and 7.95 mmol g A1 h A1 (Fig. 8A), which are about 1.5 times and 3.4 times higher than that of TiO 2 -101, respectively.It is notable that although the surface area of TiO 2 -001/101 is smaller than that of TiO 2 -101, the specific activity of the former one is much higher than that of the latter one (as shown in Table 2), indicating that the enhanced activity is not caused by the surface area.Therefore, the high activity of TiO 2 -001/101 can be attributed to the low recombination rate of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, as evident in PL spectra.When the TiO 2 NCs are irradiated under UV light, the valence band (VB) electrons are excited to the CB, while the holes remain in the VB.For TiO 2 -101, most electrons and holes are easy to accumulate on the 101 facets due to the low percentage of 001 facets.As a result, the photogenerated electrons and holes easily recombine, leading to low conversion efficiency.For TiO 2 -001, the high percentage of 001 facets on the surface of TiO 2 may cause an electron overflow effect toward 101 facets, which makes it difficult for the electrons to migrate to 101 facets.As a result, the TiO 2 -001 has lower photocatalytic activity than TiO 2 -001/101.In the case of TiO 2 -001/101, it was reported that the coexposed 101 and 001 facets of anatase can form a ''surface heterojunction'' within TiO 2 particles, which is beneficial for the transfer of photogenerated electrons and holes to 101 and 001 facets, respectively. 18D'Arienzo et al. 35 further found that the concentration of trapped holes (O A centers) increases with the increase of the 001 surface area, while that of electron traps (Ti 3 centers) increases with the increase of the 101 surface area, indicating that the 101 facets act as the reductive sites, while the 001 facets are the oxidative sites.Namely, photogenerated electrons and holes are effectively separated.In addition, D'Arienzo et al. 35 reported that the concentration of photogenerated defects (Ti 3 ) over 101 facets is also important to the activity of TiO 2 , because Ti 3 can easily transfer trapped electrons to reactants, which can account for the higher activity of TiO 2 -101 than TiO 2 -001.While based on the highest activity of TiO 2 -001/101, it can be speculated that comparing to photogenerated defects, the formation of a ''surface heterojunction'' is a more significant reason for the enhanced activity of TiO 2 -001/101. When TiO 2 NCs were loaded on graphene, the photocatalytic activity of all the G/TiO 2 composites significantly increased compared to that of pure TiO 2 NCs no matter which facet is exposed (as shown in Fig. 8B).For example, the CO yield of 10G/TiO 2 -101 and 10G/TiO 2 -001 are 41.0 and 28.0 mmol g A1 h A1 , which are about 6.2 and 6.5 times higher than that of TiO 2 -001 and TiO 2 -001, respectively.Considering that graphene has no photocatalytic activity, the reason for the enhanced activity is that the support of graphene facilitates the electron migration from the 101 or 001 facets of TiO 2 to graphene so that the recombination of electrons and holes is restrained.In addition, the enhanced surface area of G/TiO 2 composites and good dispersion of TiO 2 NCs on graphene can also contribute to the high activity of G/TiO 2 composites.It is notable that the CO and CH 4 yield of 10G/TiO 2 -101/001 is 70.8 and 27.4 mmol g A1 h A1 , respectively, which are both higher than those of 10G/TiO 2 -101 (57.4 and 17.2 mmol g A1 h A1 ) and 10G/TiO 2 -001 samples (28.0 and 9.0 mmol g A1 h A1 ).Based on the results of pure TiO 2 NCs, this demonstrates that the spatial separation of photogenerated charge carriers on TiO 2 NCs still have obvious influence on the activity of G/TiO 2 composites.In other words, the photogenerated electrons and holes on TiO 2 NCs can first separate from each other by migrating to different facets, and then the electrons on 101 facets are able to transfer to graphene, thus the photogenerated electron-hole pairs are more effectively separated, resulting in enhanced photocatalytic activity of the G/TiO 2 -101/001 catalyst. The effect of graphene amount on the activity was also investigated (Fig. 8B).The photocatalytic activity of G/TiO 2 -001/ 101 composites increased with the graphene amount increasing from 5 to 10.This can be attributed to the increased surface area caused by the increasing graphene amount.However, the photocatalytic activity of G/TiO 2 -001/101 composites decreased when the graphene amount increased to 20 even though the recombination rate of photogenerated charges is still decreasing.This may be caused by decreased content of TiO 2 , which is the active component in the composites. The selectivity of CO 2 reduction into CO and CH 4 has been discussed in various papers. 36,37Eight electrons and eight protons are needed to generate one molecular CH 4 while the formation of one molecular CO only requires two electrons and two protons.Therefore, enough supply of electrons and protons benefits the production of CH 4 . 3637738 In this study, the enhancement of CH 4 yield of TiO 2 -001/101 (comparing to TiO 2 -101) is more evident than that of CO.This can be explained by the high density of electrons on the 101 facets of TiO 2 -001/101, resulting from its effective separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs and decreased exposed area of 101 facets.Different from the effect of co-exposure of 101 and 001 facets, the support of graphene obviously enhanced the production of CO.A possible explanation is that excited electrons on G/TiO 2 -001/101 samples prefer to transfer to graphene and thus, CO 2 reduction reaction mainly happens on the surface of graphene.However, the adsorption of water on graphene was suppressed due to large amounts of oxygencontaining groups on graphene were removed during the solvothermal process.Thus, the supply of protons was not enough for the generation of CH 4 , resulting in preferred production of CO.Quantum efficiency of the CO 2 photocatalytic conversion on pure TiO 2 NCs and G/TiO 2 -001/101 samples was calculated by the following equations 39 and listed in Table 2.For TiO 2 -001/101, the quantum efficiency was calculated to be 0.0077 and 0.0250 for CO and CH 4 , respectively, and the total quantum efficiency was 0.0327 for CO 2 photocatalytic reduction. For 10G/TiO 2 -001/101 catalysts, the quantum efficiency was calculated to be 0.0557 and 0.0864 for CH 4 and CO, respectively, and the total quantum efficiency was 0.142 for CO 2 photocatalytic reduction, which is much higher than that of TiO 2 -001/101.The high photocatalytic activity of the G/TiO 2 -001/101 catalysts could be ascribed to the high surface area, good dispersion of TiO 2 NCs on graphene, and low recombination rate of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs. On the basis of the above experimental results, a simple mechanism was proposed to explain the enhanced photocatalytic activity of G/TiO 2 -001/101 catalysts (Fig. 9).When the catalyst was irradiated by UV light, the photogenerated electrons on TiO 2 NCs tend to transfer to the 101 facets while the excited holes prefer to the 001 facets.Thus, the spatial separation of photogenerated charges on TiO 2 NCs is achieved.Then the electrons accumulated on 101 facets can migrate to graphene due to the high work function of graphene. 40Consequently, the photogenerated electron-hole pairs are more effectively separated.Finally, the CO 2 reacts with the electrons on graphene to generate hydrocarbons and meanwhile, H 2 O was oxidized to O 2 by the holes on the TiO 2 NCs.In a word, the synergy of graphene supports and co-exposure of different facets results in the enhanced photocatalytic activity of G/TiO 2 -001/101 catalysts."}], "lamp": [{"llm generation": "Xenon", "source": "The system was mainly composed of an 85 ml self-made reactor, a 300 W Xe arc lamp positioned 10 cm above the reactor, and a gas chromatography (GC).", "context": "Graphene supported TiO 2 NCs with coexposed 101 and 001 facets were synthesized through a one-pot solvothermal method. 21First, graphene oxide (GO) was synthesized by a modified Hummers' method (Fig. S1, ESI ).Then 3 ml titanium butoxide and 0.4 ml of HF solution were added into 90 ml homogeneous GO ethanol suspension (the mass ratio of GO to TiO 2 is 0, 1, 5, 10, and 20, respectively) under sonication for 1 h.After that, the solution was transferred into a 200 ml Teflon-lined reactor and kept at 180 1C for 24 h.When the solvothermal reaction reached completion, the clave was cooled naturally to ambient temperature.The white precipitates in the clave were collected by centrifugation, then washed with ethanol and deionized water 3 times, and finally dried in an oven at 60 1C for 12 h.To remove the surface fluorine ions from the samples, the as-prepared samples were calcinated at 500 1C for 2 h in a nitrogen flow.The prepared samples were denoted as X G/TiO 2 -001/101 (X is the mass ratio of GO to TiO 2 ).Graphene supported TiO 2 NCs with exposed 101 or 001 facets (G/TiO 2 -101 and G/TiO 2 -001) were prepared in a similar manner by adding 0 or 4.8 ml HF solution.Pure TiO 2 NCs with exposed 101 or 001 facets (denoted as TiO 2 -101 and TiO 2 -001) were also prepared by adding 0 or 4.8 ml of HF solution but without the addition of GO.

The FE-SEM images in Fig. S2 (ESI ) show the morphology of pure TiO 2 (A-C) and G/TiO 2 -001/101 samples (D-F).For pure TiO 2 samples, the particle size of TiO 2 crystals increased gradually and their shapes transformed from nanoparticles into nanosheets with increasing addition of HF solution, suggesting that HF has remarkable effect on the growth and transformation of TiO 2 NCs.For G/TiO 2 -001/101 samples, the plate-like structure in the image corresponds to graphene nanosheets and the small particles on it are TiO 2 NCs.When the graphene content is 5, some TiO 2 NCs are attached on graphene while some others are detached and agglomerated, due to the low amount of graphene in the composite.With the graphene content increased from 5 to 20, more TiO 2 NCs were uniformly coated on graphene nanosheets and fewer amounts of unattached TiO 2 agglomerates can be observed, which means good combination between TiO 2 and graphene. Considering that the resolution of FE-SEM is not high enough to character the shape and facet characteristics of TiO 2 NCs, TEM and HR-TEM were used to analyse the fine structure of the catalysts (as shown in Fig. 3).It is well known that natural anatase is a truncated tetragonal bipyramidal enclosed by eight 101 facets on sides and two 001 facets on the top and bottom. 18Among pure TiO 2 NCs, TiO 2 -101 is a truncated tetragonal bipyramidal (Fig. 3A), which is similar to the natural anatase.In the presence of HF, the truncated degree and the side length of TiO 2 NCs both obviously increase along with the amount of HF (Table 1).As a result, the TiO 2 -001 sample synthesized by adding 4.8 ml of HF solution are nanosheets, which have longer sides and thinner thickness (Fig. 3E), indicating the increase of crystallization and the formation of larger crystallites.This is in line with the results of XRD and FE-SEM.The HR-TEM images (Fig. 3C) revealed that the lattice spacing parallel to the top and bottom facets of the TiO 2 crystal is 0.20 nm, which indicates the top and bottom facets are (001) planes.Fig. 3C shows clear atomic planes with a lattice spacing of 0.35 nm, corresponding to the (101) planes of anatase TiO 2 . 22The shape change of the TiO 2 NCs also causes the increase of the percentage of exposed 001 facets (Table 1), indicating that F A can promote the formation of TiO 2 nanosheets with high percentage of exposed 001 facets.The percentage of exposed 001 facets was calculated based on the method reported in ref. 18. For G/TiO 2 -001/101 samples (Fig. 3F-I), the TiO 2 NCs with coexposed 001 and 101 facets were homogeneously dispersed on graphene nanosheets.The particle size of TiO 2 NCs on graphene is larger than that of pure TiO 2 NCs, indicating that the support of graphene contributes to the growth of TiO 2 NCs, which can be responsible for the higher intensity of TiO 2 XRD peaks of G/TiO 2 -001/101 samples.However, the increase of graphene content in the composites does not show obvious influence on the shape and size of TiO 2 NCs (Fig. 3F-I and Table 1), although XRD results show that increased graphene content can enhance the crystallinity of TiO 2 NCs, revealing that the content of graphene mainly affects the crystallinity of TiO 2 but not the size and shape of TiO 2 NCs.In addition, the TiO 2 -001/101 NCs attached on the graphene sheet have much better dispersion than that of pure TiO 2 -001/101 NCs, resulting from the intimate interaction between the hydrophilic function groups (e.g., -OH, -COOH) on GO and the hydroxyl groups on TiO 2 . 13This interaction helps the electron transfer from TiO 2 to graphene during the photoexcitation process. N 2 adsorption-desorption was applied to explore the textual properties of the prepared catalyst.The specific surface area, S BET was calculated according to the classical Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) theory and summarized in Table 2.It is obvious that the surface area of pure TiO 2 NCs decreased with the adding content of HF solution, which may be due to the larger crystallite size, as evident in the results of XRD and TEM.In addition, the surface areas of all graphene/TiO 2 composites are higher than pure TiO 2 NCs and increases with the increasing content of graphene.This is due to the extremely high surface area of graphene (theoretical value of 2600 m 2 g A1 ). 13 Fig. 4 shows the FTIR spectra of GO and 10 G/ TiO 2 -001/101.The broad peak at 3000-3500 cm A1 corresponds to the stretching vibrations of -OH and/or the physically adsorbed H 2 O on the catalyst. 23The peak at 1729 cm A1 is attributed to the CQO stretching vibration. 24The peaks at 1625 cm A1 , 1220 cm A1 ,and 1050 cm A1 are ascribed to CQC, C-O-C, and C-O stretching modes, respectively. 12Furthermore, the peak at 1570 cm A1 in the spectrum of 10 G/TiO 2 -001/101 is caused by the skeletal vibration of GO. 23 Raman spectroscopy is a powerful and nondestructive tool to characterize the crystalline phase of TiO 2 and the quality of graphene.Fig. 5 shows the Raman spectra of TiO 2 -001/101, GO, and G/TiO 2 -001/101 composites containing different amounts of graphene.For TiO 2 -001/101 and G/TiO 2 -001/101 composites, several characteristic bands at 146, 397, 516, and 637 cm A1 are attributed to the E g(1) , B 1g(1) , A 1g B 1g (2) , and E g(2) modes of anatase TiO 2 , respectively. 9Notably, the peak corresponding to the E g mode for the G/TiO 2 -001/101 composites is significantly red-shifted comparing to the TiO 2 -001/101 sample (Fig. 5, inset).It was reported that the shift of the Raman peak can be attributed to the strain developed on the G/ TiO 2 -001/101 surface and the phonon confinement effect because of the change in the crystal size of materials. 25In our work, the red shift of the E g peak indicates the larger crystal sizes of G/TiO 2 -001/101 composites than TiO 2 -001/101 samples. 26This is in line with the results of XRD and TEM, indicating a strong interaction between TiO 2 and graphene. The significant structural changes in GO during the solvothermal reaction process can also be reflected in the Raman spectra.There are two typical Raman bands, the D peak centered at 1346 cm A1 and the G peak at 1587 cm A1 , 24 found in GO and the composites.The former is common for disordered sp 2 carbon and the latter is due to the in-plane stretching motion of symmetric sp 2 C-C bonds.The composite showed an increased D/G intensity ratio comparing to GO, which indicates a decrease in the average size of the in-plane sp 2 domains of C atoms in the composite, 27 confirming the existence of graphene sheets in the G/TiO 2 -001/101 composites. 9,28n order to investigate the surface composition and the interaction between TiO 2 and graphene in G/TiO 2 -001/101 composites, the XPS spectra of TiO 2 -001/101 and G/TiO 2 -001/101 composites were recorded and are shown in Fig. 6.As shown in Fig. 6A, there are two peaks in the binding energy region of Ti 2p.The binding energy of Ti 2p 3/2 for each sample is around 459.4 eV, suggesting a normal state of Ti 4 in the TiO 2 . 29,30Comparing to the peak position of the TiO 2 -001/101 sample, the peaks of G/TiO 2 -001/101 composites show a shift to higher binding energy values.This phenomenon is most obvious in the 20G/TiO 2 -001/101 sample containing the largest amount of graphene.Similar results were reported elsewhere. 10The positive shift of Ti 2p spectra can be attributed to the strong interactions at interfaces between TiO 2 and graphene, resulting in the formation of electron transfer channels, 10,21 which benefits the transfer of excited electrons from the conduction band of TiO 2 to graphene during the photocatalytic process.Undoubtedly, this will enhance the photocatalytic activity of G/TiO 2 -001/101 composites. Fig. 6B shows the O 1s XPS spectra of TiO 2 -001/101 and G/TiO 2 -001/101 composites.The peaks at around 530.6 and 532.5 eV can be attributed to the lattice oxygen (Ti-O-Ti) of TiO 2 and the surface hydroxyl of TiO 2 and graphene, respectively. 12Similar to the Ti 2p spectra, a positive shift of the Ti-O-Ti peaks for G/TiO 2 -001/101 composites is also observed comparing to TiO 2 -001/101, which further proves the electron transfer between TiO 2 and graphene, resulting from their strong interactions. The C 1s XPS spectra of GO, RGO and G/TiO 2 -001/101 composites are exhibited in Fig. 6C.There are three peaks in the spectra of G/TiO 2 -001/101 composites, which are centered at around 284.5, 285.6, and 286.7 eV, respectively.The peak at 284.5 eV is assigned to the C-C, CQC, and C-H bonds in graphene, 12 and the peaks at 285.8 and 286.7 eV are attributed to the C-O and CQO bonds in graphene. 8Comparing to the XPS spectrum of GO, a negative shift of the C 1s peaks of G/TiO 2 -001/101 samples can also be observed, again demonstrating the electron transfer from TiO 2 to graphene.It is worth noting that the intensity of oxygen-containing functional groups of RGO and G/TiO 2 -001/101 samples decreased obviously, demonstrating that GO has been converted to graphene.This is in line with the results of FTIR that GO was partially reduced to graphene through the solvothermal process.The reduction of GO during the solvothermal synthesis of TiO 2 /graphene composites has been reported before, 26,31 which can be attributed to the reduction of GO by solvent 32 and/or the reaction between the Ti-containing intermediate and the graphene surface, leading to the covalent attachment of TiO 2 . 31The formation of C-O-Ti bonds may involve the reaction of TiO 2 with oxygen-containing groups on the surface of graphene, such as COOH and CQO groups. 31,33The reaction of TiO 2 intermediates with these groups can account for the low contents of oxygen-containing groups found in the G/TiO 2 -001/101 samples. The fluorescence of the semiconductor is caused by the recombination of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs, thus the PL spectra have been widely used to investigate the recombination rate of electron-hole pairs in the semiconductor.As shown in Fig. 7A, the fluorescence intensity of TiO 2 -001/101 is the lowest among the pure TiO 2 NCs, indicating that the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs can be suppressed by optimizing the ratio of 001 and 101 facets.This is due to the appropriate ratio of 001 and 101 facets can enhance the spatial separation of photogenerated electrons and holes.However, the higher percentage of exposed 001 facets can work as recombination centers and inhibit the separation of charges. 18When TiO 2 NCs were deposited onto graphene, the fluorescence intensity of G/TiO 2 -001/101 dramatically decreased, indicating that graphene can further restrain the recombination of photogenerated electronhole pairs on TiO 2 NCs due to the transfer of photogenerated electrons from TiO 2 to graphene. 34This result is consistent with the results of XPS.With the ratio of graphene increased from 5 to 20, the PL intensity of G/TiO 2 -001/101 becomes even lower.Fig. 7B further shows that the PL intensity of G/TiO 2 -001/101 catalysts at 550 nm depends linearly on the TiO 2 content in the composites, demonstrating that with the grapheme content increased from 5 to 20, the decreased PL intensity of G/TiO 2 -001/101 is mainly caused by the decreasing TiO 2 content in the composites.The electron transfer from TiO 2 to graphene in G/TiO 2 -001/101 samples is not obviously accelerated with the graphene content increased from 5 to 20. Before the experiment, a series of background tests were conducted to confirm that any carbon-containing compounds in the effluent gas measured by the GC indeed originated from CO 2 through photocatalytic reactions.First, tests were conducted using CO 2 and water vapor as the purging and reaction gases: (1) empty reactor and (2) reactor with a Petri plate but no catalyst in it.No carboncontaining compounds were detected in the dark or under UV irradiation in these two cases.This demonstrated that the CO 2 reduction could not proceed without a photocatalyst.Second, Ar (instead of CO 2 ) and water vapor were used as the purging and reaction gases in the presence of a photocatalyst.No carboncontaining compounds were produced under UV irradiation.This indicated that the CO 2 was the only carbon source. CO and CH 4 were found to be the main photocatalytic products and no H 2 was detected, suggesting H 2 was involved in the reduction of CO 2 .Fig. 8 shows the CO and CH 4 yields of pure TiO 2 NCs and G/TiO 2 composites under the following reaction conditions: photocatalyst, 10 mg; reaction temperature, 120 1C; molar ratio of H 2 O/CO 2 , 0.21, light source, 300-400 nm; irradiation time, 4 h.Among the pure TiO 2 NCs enclosed by different facets, TiO 2 -001/101 has the highest photocatalytic activity, with a CO and CH 4 yield of 9.73 and 7.95 mmol g A1 h A1 (Fig. 8A), which are about 1.5 times and 3.4 times higher than that of TiO 2 -101, respectively.It is notable that although the surface area of TiO 2 -001/101 is smaller than that of TiO 2 -101, the specific activity of the former one is much higher than that of the latter one (as shown in Table 2), indicating that the enhanced activity is not caused by the surface area.Therefore, the high activity of TiO 2 -001/101 can be attributed to the low recombination rate of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, as evident in PL spectra.When the TiO 2 NCs are irradiated under UV light, the valence band (VB) electrons are excited to the CB, while the holes remain in the VB.For TiO 2 -101, most electrons and holes are easy to accumulate on the 101 facets due to the low percentage of 001 facets.As a result, the photogenerated electrons and holes easily recombine, leading to low conversion efficiency.For TiO 2 -001, the high percentage of 001 facets on the surface of TiO 2 may cause an electron overflow effect toward 101 facets, which makes it difficult for the electrons to migrate to 101 facets.As a result, the TiO 2 -001 has lower photocatalytic activity than TiO 2 -001/101.In the case of TiO 2 -001/101, it was reported that the coexposed 101 and 001 facets of anatase can form a ''surface heterojunction'' within TiO 2 particles, which is beneficial for the transfer of photogenerated electrons and holes to 101 and 001 facets, respectively. 18D'Arienzo et al. 35 further found that the concentration of trapped holes (O A centers) increases with the increase of the 001 surface area, while that of electron traps (Ti 3 centers) increases with the increase of the 101 surface area, indicating that the 101 facets act as the reductive sites, while the 001 facets are the oxidative sites.Namely, photogenerated electrons and holes are effectively separated.In addition, D'Arienzo et al. 35 reported that the concentration of photogenerated defects (Ti 3 ) over 101 facets is also important to the activity of TiO 2 , because Ti 3 can easily transfer trapped electrons to reactants, which can account for the higher activity of TiO 2 -101 than TiO 2 -001.While based on the highest activity of TiO 2 -001/101, it can be speculated that comparing to photogenerated defects, the formation of a ''surface heterojunction'' is a more significant reason for the enhanced activity of TiO 2 -001/101. When TiO 2 NCs were loaded on graphene, the photocatalytic activity of all the G/TiO 2 composites significantly increased compared to that of pure TiO 2 NCs no matter which facet is exposed (as shown in Fig. 8B).For example, the CO yield of 10G/TiO 2 -101 and 10G/TiO 2 -001 are 41.0 and 28.0 mmol g A1 h A1 , which are about 6.2 and 6.5 times higher than that of TiO 2 -001 and TiO 2 -001, respectively.Considering that graphene has no photocatalytic activity, the reason for the enhanced activity is that the support of graphene facilitates the electron migration from the 101 or 001 facets of TiO 2 to graphene so that the recombination of electrons and holes is restrained.In addition, the enhanced surface area of G/TiO 2 composites and good dispersion of TiO 2 NCs on graphene can also contribute to the high activity of G/TiO 2 composites.It is notable that the CO and CH 4 yield of 10G/TiO 2 -101/001 is 70.8 and 27.4 mmol g A1 h A1 , respectively, which are both higher than those of 10G/TiO 2 -101 (57.4 and 17.2 mmol g A1 h A1 ) and 10G/TiO 2 -001 samples (28.0 and 9.0 mmol g A1 h A1 ).Based on the results of pure TiO 2 NCs, this demonstrates that the spatial separation of photogenerated charge carriers on TiO 2 NCs still have obvious influence on the activity of G/TiO 2 composites.In other words, the photogenerated electrons and holes on TiO 2 NCs can first separate from each other by migrating to different facets, and then the electrons on 101 facets are able to transfer to graphene, thus the photogenerated electron-hole pairs are more effectively separated, resulting in enhanced photocatalytic activity of the G/TiO 2 -101/001 catalyst. The effect of graphene amount on the activity was also investigated (Fig. 8B).The photocatalytic activity of G/TiO 2 -001/ 101 composites increased with the graphene amount increasing from 5 to 10.This can be attributed to the increased surface area caused by the increasing graphene amount.However, the photocatalytic activity of G/TiO 2 -001/101 composites decreased when the graphene amount increased to 20 even though the recombination rate of photogenerated charges is still decreasing.This may be caused by decreased content of TiO 2 , which is the active component in the composites. The selectivity of CO 2 reduction into CO and CH 4 has been discussed in various papers. 36,37Eight electrons and eight protons are needed to generate one molecular CH 4 while the formation of one molecular CO only requires two electrons and two protons.Therefore, enough supply of electrons and protons benefits the production of CH 4 . 3637738 In this study, the enhancement of CH 4 yield of TiO 2 -001/101 (comparing to TiO 2 -101) is more evident than that of CO.This can be explained by the high density of electrons on the 101 facets of TiO 2 -001/101, resulting from its effective separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs and decreased exposed area of 101 facets.Different from the effect of co-exposure of 101 and 001 facets, the support of graphene obviously enhanced the production of CO.A possible explanation is that excited electrons on G/TiO 2 -001/101 samples prefer to transfer to graphene and thus, CO 2 reduction reaction mainly happens on the surface of graphene.However, the adsorption of water on graphene was suppressed due to large amounts of oxygencontaining groups on graphene were removed during the solvothermal process.Thus, the supply of protons was not enough for the generation of CH 4 , resulting in preferred production of CO.Quantum efficiency of the CO 2 photocatalytic conversion on pure TiO 2 NCs and G/TiO 2 -001/101 samples was calculated by the following equations 39 and listed in Table 2.For TiO 2 -001/101, the quantum efficiency was calculated to be 0.0077 and 0.0250 for CO and CH 4 , respectively, and the total quantum efficiency was 0.0327 for CO 2 photocatalytic reduction. For 10G/TiO 2 -001/101 catalysts, the quantum efficiency was calculated to be 0.0557 and 0.0864 for CH 4 and CO, respectively, and the total quantum efficiency was 0.142 for CO 2 photocatalytic reduction, which is much higher than that of TiO 2 -001/101.The high photocatalytic activity of the G/TiO 2 -001/101 catalysts could be ascribed to the high surface area, good dispersion of TiO 2 NCs on graphene, and low recombination rate of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs. On the basis of the above experimental results, a simple mechanism was proposed to explain the enhanced photocatalytic activity of G/TiO 2 -001/101 catalysts (Fig. 9).When the catalyst was irradiated by UV light, the photogenerated electrons on TiO 2 NCs tend to transfer to the 101 facets while the excited holes prefer to the 001 facets.Thus, the spatial separation of photogenerated charges on TiO 2 NCs is achieved.Then the electrons accumulated on 101 facets can migrate to graphene due to the high work function of graphene. 40Consequently, the photogenerated electron-hole pairs are more effectively separated.Finally, the CO 2 reacts with the electrons on graphene to generate hydrocarbons and meanwhile, H 2 O was oxidized to O 2 by the holes on the TiO 2 NCs.In a word, the synergy of graphene supports and co-exposure of different facets results in the enhanced photocatalytic activity of G/TiO 2 -001/101 catalysts."}], "reactor type": [{"llm generation": "Fixed-bed", "source": "First, tests were conducted using CO 2 and water vapor as the purging and reaction gases: (1) empty reactor and (2) reactor with a Petri plate but no catalyst in it.", "context": "Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of as-prepared catalysts.TiO 2 in all the samples existed as anatase and no peaks corresponding to rutile were observed.Meanwhile, no diffraction peaks for carbon species were observed in G/TiO 2 -001/101 samples, which might be due to the relatively low diffraction intensity of graphene.It is worth noting that for pure TiO 2 , the intensity of the TiO 2 characteristic peaks increased gradually and their shapes became sharper with the increasing amount of HF solution, indicating the increase of TiO 2 crystallinity. 18For G/TiO 2 -001/101 samples, the intensity of the (101) peak of anatase enhanced with the graphene content increased from 5 to 20, showing increased TiO 2 crystallinity.A similar phenomenon was also observed by Zhang et al. 10 The phenomenon can be explained that graphene may contribute to the adsorption of TiO 2 precursors and work as a substrate for the crystallization and growth of TiO 2 NCs. The FE-SEM images in Fig. S2 (ESI ) show the morphology of pure TiO 2 (A-C) and G/TiO 2 -001/101 samples (D-F).For pure TiO 2 samples, the particle size of TiO 2 crystals increased gradually and their shapes transformed from nanoparticles into nanosheets with increasing addition of HF solution, suggesting that HF has remarkable effect on the growth and transformation of TiO 2 NCs.For G/TiO 2 -001/101 samples, the plate-like structure in the image corresponds to graphene nanosheets and the small particles on it are TiO 2 NCs.When the graphene content is 5, some TiO 2 NCs are attached on graphene while some others are detached and agglomerated, due to the low amount of graphene in the composite.With the graphene content increased from 5 to 20, more TiO 2 NCs were uniformly coated on graphene nanosheets and fewer amounts of unattached TiO 2 agglomerates can be observed, which means good combination between TiO 2 and graphene. Considering that the resolution of FE-SEM is not high enough to character the shape and facet characteristics of TiO 2 NCs, TEM and HR-TEM were used to analyse the fine structure of the catalysts (as shown in Fig. 3).It is well known that natural anatase is a truncated tetragonal bipyramidal enclosed by eight 101 facets on sides and two 001 facets on the top and bottom. 18Among pure TiO 2 NCs, TiO 2 -101 is a truncated tetragonal bipyramidal (Fig. 3A), which is similar to the natural anatase.In the presence of HF, the truncated degree and the side length of TiO 2 NCs both obviously increase along with the amount of HF (Table 1).As a result, the TiO 2 -001 sample synthesized by adding 4.8 ml of HF solution are nanosheets, which have longer sides and thinner thickness (Fig. 3E), indicating the increase of crystallization and the formation of larger crystallites.This is in line with the results of XRD and FE-SEM.The HR-TEM images (Fig. 3C) revealed that the lattice spacing parallel to the top and bottom facets of the TiO 2 crystal is 0.20 nm, which indicates the top and bottom facets are (001) planes.Fig. 3C shows clear atomic planes with a lattice spacing of 0.35 nm, corresponding to the (101) planes of anatase TiO 2 . 22The shape change of the TiO 2 NCs also causes the increase of the percentage of exposed 001 facets (Table 1), indicating that F A can promote the formation of TiO 2 nanosheets with high percentage of exposed 001 facets.The percentage of exposed 001 facets was calculated based on the method reported in ref. 18. For G/TiO 2 -001/101 samples (Fig. 3F-I), the TiO 2 NCs with coexposed 001 and 101 facets were homogeneously dispersed on graphene nanosheets.The particle size of TiO 2 NCs on graphene is larger than that of pure TiO 2 NCs, indicating that the support of graphene contributes to the growth of TiO 2 NCs, which can be responsible for the higher intensity of TiO 2 XRD peaks of G/TiO 2 -001/101 samples.However, the increase of graphene content in the composites does not show obvious influence on the shape and size of TiO 2 NCs (Fig. 3F-I and Table 1), although XRD results show that increased graphene content can enhance the crystallinity of TiO 2 NCs, revealing that the content of graphene mainly affects the crystallinity of TiO 2 but not the size and shape of TiO 2 NCs.In addition, the TiO 2 -001/101 NCs attached on the graphene sheet have much better dispersion than that of pure TiO 2 -001/101 NCs, resulting from the intimate interaction between the hydrophilic function groups (e.g., -OH, -COOH) on GO and the hydroxyl groups on TiO 2 . 13This interaction helps the electron transfer from TiO 2 to graphene during the photoexcitation process. N 2 adsorption-desorption was applied to explore the textual properties of the prepared catalyst.The specific surface area, S BET was calculated according to the classical Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) theory and summarized in Table 2.It is obvious that the surface area of pure TiO 2 NCs decreased with the adding content of HF solution, which may be due to the larger crystallite size, as evident in the results of XRD and TEM.In addition, the surface areas of all graphene/TiO 2 composites are higher than pure TiO 2 NCs and increases with the increasing content of graphene.This is due to the extremely high surface area of graphene (theoretical value of 2600 m 2 g A1 ). 13 Fig. 4 shows the FTIR spectra of GO and 10 G/ TiO 2 -001/101.The broad peak at 3000-3500 cm A1 corresponds to the stretching vibrations of -OH and/or the physically adsorbed H 2 O on the catalyst. 23The peak at 1729 cm A1 is attributed to the CQO stretching vibration. 24The peaks at 1625 cm A1 , 1220 cm A1 ,and 1050 cm A1 are ascribed to CQC, C-O-C, and C-O stretching modes, respectively. 12Furthermore, the peak at 1570 cm A1 in the spectrum of 10 G/TiO 2 -001/101 is caused by the skeletal vibration of GO. 23 Raman spectroscopy is a powerful and nondestructive tool to characterize the crystalline phase of TiO 2 and the quality of graphene.Fig. 5 shows the Raman spectra of TiO 2 -001/101, GO, and G/TiO 2 -001/101 composites containing different amounts of graphene.For TiO 2 -001/101 and G/TiO 2 -001/101 composites, several characteristic bands at 146, 397, 516, and 637 cm A1 are attributed to the E g(1) , B 1g(1) , A 1g B 1g (2) , and E g(2) modes of anatase TiO 2 , respectively. 9Notably, the peak corresponding to the E g mode for the G/TiO 2 -001/101 composites is significantly red-shifted comparing to the TiO 2 -001/101 sample (Fig. 5, inset).It was reported that the shift of the Raman peak can be attributed to the strain developed on the G/ TiO 2 -001/101 surface and the phonon confinement effect because of the change in the crystal size of materials. 25In our work, the red shift of the E g peak indicates the larger crystal sizes of G/TiO 2 -001/101 composites than TiO 2 -001/101 samples. 26This is in line with the results of XRD and TEM, indicating a strong interaction between TiO 2 and graphene. The significant structural changes in GO during the solvothermal reaction process can also be reflected in the Raman spectra.There are two typical Raman bands, the D peak centered at 1346 cm A1 and the G peak at 1587 cm A1 , 24 found in GO and the composites.The former is common for disordered sp 2 carbon and the latter is due to the in-plane stretching motion of symmetric sp 2 C-C bonds.The composite showed an increased D/G intensity ratio comparing to GO, which indicates a decrease in the average size of the in-plane sp 2 domains of C atoms in the composite, 27 confirming the existence of graphene sheets in the G/TiO 2 -001/101 composites. 9,28n order to investigate the surface composition and the interaction between TiO 2 and graphene in G/TiO 2 -001/101 composites, the XPS spectra of TiO 2 -001/101 and G/TiO 2 -001/101 composites were recorded and are shown in Fig. 6.As shown in Fig. 6A, there are two peaks in the binding energy region of Ti 2p.The binding energy of Ti 2p 3/2 for each sample is around 459.4 eV, suggesting a normal state of Ti 4 in the TiO 2 . 29,30Comparing to the peak position of the TiO 2 -001/101 sample, the peaks of G/TiO 2 -001/101 composites show a shift to higher binding energy values.This phenomenon is most obvious in the 20G/TiO 2 -001/101 sample containing the largest amount of graphene.Similar results were reported elsewhere. 10The positive shift of Ti 2p spectra can be attributed to the strong interactions at interfaces between TiO 2 and graphene, resulting in the formation of electron transfer channels, 10,21 which benefits the transfer of excited electrons from the conduction band of TiO 2 to graphene during the photocatalytic process.Undoubtedly, this will enhance the photocatalytic activity of G/TiO 2 -001/101 composites. Fig. 6B shows the O 1s XPS spectra of TiO 2 -001/101 and G/TiO 2 -001/101 composites.The peaks at around 530.6 and 532.5 eV can be attributed to the lattice oxygen (Ti-O-Ti) of TiO 2 and the surface hydroxyl of TiO 2 and graphene, respectively. 12Similar to the Ti 2p spectra, a positive shift of the Ti-O-Ti peaks for G/TiO 2 -001/101 composites is also observed comparing to TiO 2 -001/101, which further proves the electron transfer between TiO 2 and graphene, resulting from their strong interactions. The C 1s XPS spectra of GO, RGO and G/TiO 2 -001/101 composites are exhibited in Fig. 6C.There are three peaks in the spectra of G/TiO 2 -001/101 composites, which are centered at around 284.5, 285.6, and 286.7 eV, respectively.The peak at 284.5 eV is assigned to the C-C, CQC, and C-H bonds in graphene, 12 and the peaks at 285.8 and 286.7 eV are attributed to the C-O and CQO bonds in graphene. 8Comparing to the XPS spectrum of GO, a negative shift of the C 1s peaks of G/TiO 2 -001/101 samples can also be observed, again demonstrating the electron transfer from TiO 2 to graphene.It is worth noting that the intensity of oxygen-containing functional groups of RGO and G/TiO 2 -001/101 samples decreased obviously, demonstrating that GO has been converted to graphene.This is in line with the results of FTIR that GO was partially reduced to graphene through the solvothermal process.The reduction of GO during the solvothermal synthesis of TiO 2 /graphene composites has been reported before, 26,31 which can be attributed to the reduction of GO by solvent 32 and/or the reaction between the Ti-containing intermediate and the graphene surface, leading to the covalent attachment of TiO 2 . 31The formation of C-O-Ti bonds may involve the reaction of TiO 2 with oxygen-containing groups on the surface of graphene, such as COOH and CQO groups. 31,33The reaction of TiO 2 intermediates with these groups can account for the low contents of oxygen-containing groups found in the G/TiO 2 -001/101 samples. The fluorescence of the semiconductor is caused by the recombination of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs, thus the PL spectra have been widely used to investigate the recombination rate of electron-hole pairs in the semiconductor.As shown in Fig. 7A, the fluorescence intensity of TiO 2 -001/101 is the lowest among the pure TiO 2 NCs, indicating that the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs can be suppressed by optimizing the ratio of 001 and 101 facets.This is due to the appropriate ratio of 001 and 101 facets can enhance the spatial separation of photogenerated electrons and holes.However, the higher percentage of exposed 001 facets can work as recombination centers and inhibit the separation of charges. 18When TiO 2 NCs were deposited onto graphene, the fluorescence intensity of G/TiO 2 -001/101 dramatically decreased, indicating that graphene can further restrain the recombination of photogenerated electronhole pairs on TiO 2 NCs due to the transfer of photogenerated electrons from TiO 2 to graphene. 34This result is consistent with the results of XPS.With the ratio of graphene increased from 5 to 20, the PL intensity of G/TiO 2 -001/101 becomes even lower.Fig. 7B further shows that the PL intensity of G/TiO 2 -001/101 catalysts at 550 nm depends linearly on the TiO 2 content in the composites, demonstrating that with the grapheme content increased from 5 to 20, the decreased PL intensity of G/TiO 2 -001/101 is mainly caused by the decreasing TiO 2 content in the composites.The electron transfer from TiO 2 to graphene in G/TiO 2 -001/101 samples is not obviously accelerated with the graphene content increased from 5 to 20. Before the experiment, a series of background tests were conducted to confirm that any carbon-containing compounds in the effluent gas measured by the GC indeed originated from CO 2 through photocatalytic reactions.First, tests were conducted using CO 2 and water vapor as the purging and reaction gases: (1) empty reactor and (2) reactor with a Petri plate but no catalyst in it.No carboncontaining compounds were detected in the dark or under UV irradiation in these two cases.This demonstrated that the CO 2 reduction could not proceed without a photocatalyst.Second, Ar (instead of CO 2 ) and water vapor were used as the purging and reaction gases in the presence of a photocatalyst.No carboncontaining compounds were produced under UV irradiation.This indicated that the CO 2 was the only carbon source. CO and CH 4 were found to be the main photocatalytic products and no H 2 was detected, suggesting H 2 was involved in the reduction of CO 2 .Fig. 8 shows the CO and CH 4 yields of pure TiO 2 NCs and G/TiO 2 composites under the following reaction conditions: photocatalyst, 10 mg; reaction temperature, 120 1C; molar ratio of H 2 O/CO 2 , 0.21, light source, 300-400 nm; irradiation time, 4 h.Among the pure TiO 2 NCs enclosed by different facets, TiO 2 -001/101 has the highest photocatalytic activity, with a CO and CH 4 yield of 9.73 and 7.95 mmol g A1 h A1 (Fig. 8A), which are about 1.5 times and 3.4 times higher than that of TiO 2 -101, respectively.It is notable that although the surface area of TiO 2 -001/101 is smaller than that of TiO 2 -101, the specific activity of the former one is much higher than that of the latter one (as shown in Table 2), indicating that the enhanced activity is not caused by the surface area.Therefore, the high activity of TiO 2 -001/101 can be attributed to the low recombination rate of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, as evident in PL spectra.When the TiO 2 NCs are irradiated under UV light, the valence band (VB) electrons are excited to the CB, while the holes remain in the VB.For TiO 2 -101, most electrons and holes are easy to accumulate on the 101 facets due to the low percentage of 001 facets.As a result, the photogenerated electrons and holes easily recombine, leading to low conversion efficiency.For TiO 2 -001, the high percentage of 001 facets on the surface of TiO 2 may cause an electron overflow effect toward 101 facets, which makes it difficult for the electrons to migrate to 101 facets.As a result, the TiO 2 -001 has lower photocatalytic activity than TiO 2 -001/101.In the case of TiO 2 -001/101, it was reported that the coexposed 101 and 001 facets of anatase can form a ''surface heterojunction'' within TiO 2 particles, which is beneficial for the transfer of photogenerated electrons and holes to 101 and 001 facets, respectively. 18D'Arienzo et al. 35 further found that the concentration of trapped holes (O A centers) increases with the increase of the 001 surface area, while that of electron traps (Ti 3 centers) increases with the increase of the 101 surface area, indicating that the 101 facets act as the reductive sites, while the 001 facets are the oxidative sites.Namely, photogenerated electrons and holes are effectively separated.In addition, D'Arienzo et al. 35 reported that the concentration of photogenerated defects (Ti 3 ) over 101 facets is also important to the activity of TiO 2 , because Ti 3 can easily transfer trapped electrons to reactants, which can account for the higher activity of TiO 2 -101 than TiO 2 -001.While based on the highest activity of TiO 2 -001/101, it can be speculated that comparing to photogenerated defects, the formation of a ''surface heterojunction'' is a more significant reason for the enhanced activity of TiO 2 -001/101. When TiO 2 NCs were loaded on graphene, the photocatalytic activity of all the G/TiO 2 composites significantly increased compared to that of pure TiO 2 NCs no matter which facet is exposed (as shown in Fig. 8B).For example, the CO yield of 10G/TiO 2 -101 and 10G/TiO 2 -001 are 41.0 and 28.0 mmol g A1 h A1 , which are about 6.2 and 6.5 times higher than that of TiO 2 -001 and TiO 2 -001, respectively.Considering that graphene has no photocatalytic activity, the reason for the enhanced activity is that the support of graphene facilitates the electron migration from the 101 or 001 facets of TiO 2 to graphene so that the recombination of electrons and holes is restrained.In addition, the enhanced surface area of G/TiO 2 composites and good dispersion of TiO 2 NCs on graphene can also contribute to the high activity of G/TiO 2 composites.It is notable that the CO and CH 4 yield of 10G/TiO 2 -101/001 is 70.8 and 27.4 mmol g A1 h A1 , respectively, which are both higher than those of 10G/TiO 2 -101 (57.4 and 17.2 mmol g A1 h A1 ) and 10G/TiO 2 -001 samples (28.0 and 9.0 mmol g A1 h A1 ).Based on the results of pure TiO 2 NCs, this demonstrates that the spatial separation of photogenerated charge carriers on TiO 2 NCs still have obvious influence on the activity of G/TiO 2 composites.In other words, the photogenerated electrons and holes on TiO 2 NCs can first separate from each other by migrating to different facets, and then the electrons on 101 facets are able to transfer to graphene, thus the photogenerated electron-hole pairs are more effectively separated, resulting in enhanced photocatalytic activity of the G/TiO 2 -101/001 catalyst. The effect of graphene amount on the activity was also investigated (Fig. 8B).The photocatalytic activity of G/TiO 2 -001/ 101 composites increased with the graphene amount increasing from 5 to 10.This can be attributed to the increased surface area caused by the increasing graphene amount.However, the photocatalytic activity of G/TiO 2 -001/101 composites decreased when the graphene amount increased to 20 even though the recombination rate of photogenerated charges is still decreasing.This may be caused by decreased content of TiO 2 , which is the active component in the composites. The selectivity of CO 2 reduction into CO and CH 4 has been discussed in various papers. 36,37Eight electrons and eight protons are needed to generate one molecular CH 4 while the formation of one molecular CO only requires two electrons and two protons.Therefore, enough supply of electrons and protons benefits the production of CH 4 . 3637738 In this study, the enhancement of CH 4 yield of TiO 2 -001/101 (comparing to TiO 2 -101) is more evident than that of CO.This can be explained by the high density of electrons on the 101 facets of TiO 2 -001/101, resulting from its effective separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs and decreased exposed area of 101 facets.Different from the effect of co-exposure of 101 and 001 facets, the support of graphene obviously enhanced the production of CO.A possible explanation is that excited electrons on G/TiO 2 -001/101 samples prefer to transfer to graphene and thus, CO 2 reduction reaction mainly happens on the surface of graphene.However, the adsorption of water on graphene was suppressed due to large amounts of oxygencontaining groups on graphene were removed during the solvothermal process.Thus, the supply of protons was not enough for the generation of CH 4 , resulting in preferred production of CO.Quantum efficiency of the CO 2 photocatalytic conversion on pure TiO 2 NCs and G/TiO 2 -001/101 samples was calculated by the following equations 39 and listed in Table 2.For TiO 2 -001/101, the quantum efficiency was calculated to be 0.0077 and 0.0250 for CO and CH 4 , respectively, and the total quantum efficiency was 0.0327 for CO 2 photocatalytic reduction. For 10G/TiO 2 -001/101 catalysts, the quantum efficiency was calculated to be 0.0557 and 0.0864 for CH 4 and CO, respectively, and the total quantum efficiency was 0.142 for CO 2 photocatalytic reduction, which is much higher than that of TiO 2 -001/101.The high photocatalytic activity of the G/TiO 2 -001/101 catalysts could be ascribed to the high surface area, good dispersion of TiO 2 NCs on graphene, and low recombination rate of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs. On the basis of the above experimental results, a simple mechanism was proposed to explain the enhanced photocatalytic activity of G/TiO 2 -001/101 catalysts (Fig. 9).When the catalyst was irradiated by UV light, the photogenerated electrons on TiO 2 NCs tend to transfer to the 101 facets while the excited holes prefer to the 001 facets.Thus, the spatial separation of photogenerated charges on TiO 2 NCs is achieved.Then the electrons accumulated on 101 facets can migrate to graphene due to the high work function of graphene. 40Consequently, the photogenerated electron-hole pairs are more effectively separated.Finally, the CO 2 reacts with the electrons on graphene to generate hydrocarbons and meanwhile, H 2 O was oxidized to O 2 by the holes on the TiO 2 NCs.In a word, the synergy of graphene supports and co-exposure of different facets results in the enhanced photocatalytic activity of G/TiO 2 -001/101 catalysts."}], "operation mode": [{"llm generation": "Continuous", "source": "The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with water vapour under UV irradiation was carried out in a continuous-flow reactor at atmospheric pressure and in case of the condensation of water vapour in the reactor (as shown in Fig. 1).", "context": "Graphene supported TiO 2 NCs with coexposed 101 and 001 facets were synthesized through a one-pot solvothermal method. 21First, graphene oxide (GO) was synthesized by a modified Hummers' method (Fig. S1, ESI ).Then 3 ml titanium butoxide and 0.4 ml of HF solution were added into 90 ml homogeneous GO ethanol suspension (the mass ratio of GO to TiO 2 is 0, 1, 5, 10, and 20, respectively) under sonication for 1 h.After that, the solution was transferred into a 200 ml Teflon-lined reactor and kept at 180 1C for 24 h.When the solvothermal reaction reached completion, the clave was cooled naturally to ambient temperature.The white precipitates in the clave were collected by centrifugation, then washed with ethanol and deionized water 3 times, and finally dried in an oven at 60 1C for 12 h.To remove the surface fluorine ions from the samples, the as-prepared samples were calcinated at 500 1C for 2 h in a nitrogen flow.The prepared samples were denoted as X G/TiO 2 -001/101 (X is the mass ratio of GO to TiO 2 ).Graphene supported TiO 2 NCs with exposed 101 or 001 facets (G/TiO 2 -101 and G/TiO 2 -001) were prepared in a similar manner by adding 0 or 4.8 ml HF solution.Pure TiO 2 NCs with exposed 101 or 001 facets (denoted as TiO 2 -101 and TiO 2 -001) were also prepared by adding 0 or 4.8 ml of HF solution but without the addition of GO. The crystalline phase of the sample was identified by X-ray diffractometry (XRD) on an X'Pert PRO diffractometer using Cu Ka radiation (l 0.1542 nm) in the range of 10-808 with a step of 18 min A1 .The specific surface area was measured by nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms using a Micrometrics ASAP 2020 surface area and porosity analyzer.The inner structure of the catalyst was analyzed using a transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM, HR-TEM Tecnai G 2 F30).Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were obtained on a Bruker VERTEX 70 FT-IR spectrophotometer.X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurement (XPS) was carried out on a Shimadzu/KRATOS AXIS-ULTRA DLD-600W equipped with Al/Mg Ka radiation.Raman and photoluminescence spectra (PL) of the catalyst were recorded at room temperature on a confocal laser Raman microscope (Horiba JobinYvon, LabRAM HR800).A 325 nm He-Cd laser source was used to excite the material in the PL test. The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with water vapour under UV irradiation was carried out in a continuous-flow reactor at atmospheric pressure and in case of the condensation of water vapour in the reactor (as shown in Fig. 1).The system was mainly composed of an 85 ml self-made reactor, a 300 W Xe arc lamp positioned 10 cm above the reactor, and a gas chromatography (GC).The reactor has a stainless steel wall and a quartz window at the top.Catalyst powder was supported by a Petri plate placed on the bottom of the reactor.A 300 W Xe arc lamp was used as the light source and a liquid cooler was equipped to absorb the infrared portion of the light.The UV light irradiation (300 nm o l o 400 nm, 20.5 mW cm A2 ) was obtained by using a UV light reflector.In a typical photocatalytic reduction experiment, 10 mg of the catalysts were ultrasonically dispersed in 5 ml deionized water in a Petri plate (diameter, 35 mm) and then dried at 80 1C to evaporate water.The catalyst was deposited on the bottom of the Petri plate in the form of a thin film.Ultrapure CO 2 (99.999) passed through a water bubbler to generate a mixture of CO 2 and water vapour.Prior to illumination, the reactor was first purged with the CO 2 H 2 O mixture at a flow rate of 200 ml min A1 for 1 h and then 5 ml min A1 for another 30 min.After the flow was stabilized, the Xe lamp was switched on to start the experiment.The concentrations of H 2 , CO, and hydrocarbons in the exhaust gas were analyzed every 30 min by a GC equipped with an automated gas sampling valve, a flame ionization detector (FID), and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD).First, the effluents containing H 2 , O 2 , CH 4 , CO and CO 2 were preseparated by a carbon molecular sieve (TDX-01) column, and CO 2 was flushed back to remove from the GC.Then the effluents flowed through a molecular sieve 5A column for the separation of H 2 , O 2 , CH 4 , and CO.Finally, H 2 in the effluents were analyzed by the TCD detector and CH 4 and CO (converted to CH 4 by a methanizer) were analyzed by the FID detector.Ar was used as the carrier gas.The calibration with certified calibration gases (0.091 mol H 2 , 0.052 mol CH 4 , 0.048 mol CO, and CO 2 as the balance gas) was performed before each experimental run."}, {"llm generation": "Continuous", "source": "Before the experiment, a series of background tests were conducted to confirm that any carbon-containing compounds in the effluent gas measured by the GC indeed originated from CO 2 through photocatalytic reactions.", "context": "Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of as-prepared catalysts.TiO 2 in all the samples existed as anatase and no peaks corresponding to rutile were observed.Meanwhile, no diffraction peaks for carbon species were observed in G/TiO 2 -001/101 samples, which might be due to the relatively low diffraction intensity of graphene.It is worth noting that for pure TiO 2 , the intensity of the TiO 2 characteristic peaks increased gradually and their shapes became sharper with the increasing amount of HF solution, indicating the increase of TiO 2 crystallinity. 18For G/TiO 2 -001/101 samples, the intensity of the (101) peak of anatase enhanced with the graphene content increased from 5 to 20, showing increased TiO 2 crystallinity.A similar phenomenon was also observed by Zhang et al. 10 The phenomenon can be explained that graphene may contribute to the adsorption of TiO 2 precursors and work as a substrate for the crystallization and growth of TiO 2 NCs. The FE-SEM images in Fig. S2 (ESI ) show the morphology of pure TiO 2 (A-C) and G/TiO 2 -001/101 samples (D-F).For pure TiO 2 samples, the particle size of TiO 2 crystals increased gradually and their shapes transformed from nanoparticles into nanosheets with increasing addition of HF solution, suggesting that HF has remarkable effect on the growth and transformation of TiO 2 NCs.For G/TiO 2 -001/101 samples, the plate-like structure in the image corresponds to graphene nanosheets and the small particles on it are TiO 2 NCs.When the graphene content is 5, some TiO 2 NCs are attached on graphene while some others are detached and agglomerated, due to the low amount of graphene in the composite.With the graphene content increased from 5 to 20, more TiO 2 NCs were uniformly coated on graphene nanosheets and fewer amounts of unattached TiO 2 agglomerates can be observed, which means good combination between TiO 2 and graphene. Considering that the resolution of FE-SEM is not high enough to character the shape and facet characteristics of TiO 2 NCs, TEM and HR-TEM were used to analyse the fine structure of the catalysts (as shown in Fig. 3).It is well known that natural anatase is a truncated tetragonal bipyramidal enclosed by eight 101 facets on sides and two 001 facets on the top and bottom. 18Among pure TiO 2 NCs, TiO 2 -101 is a truncated tetragonal bipyramidal (Fig. 3A), which is similar to the natural anatase.In the presence of HF, the truncated degree and the side length of TiO 2 NCs both obviously increase along with the amount of HF (Table 1).As a result, the TiO 2 -001 sample synthesized by adding 4.8 ml of HF solution are nanosheets, which have longer sides and thinner thickness (Fig. 3E), indicating the increase of crystallization and the formation of larger crystallites.This is in line with the results of XRD and FE-SEM.The HR-TEM images (Fig. 3C) revealed that the lattice spacing parallel to the top and bottom facets of the TiO 2 crystal is 0.20 nm, which indicates the top and bottom facets are (001) planes.Fig. 3C shows clear atomic planes with a lattice spacing of 0.35 nm, corresponding to the (101) planes of anatase TiO 2 . 22The shape change of the TiO 2 NCs also causes the increase of the percentage of exposed 001 facets (Table 1), indicating that F A can promote the formation of TiO 2 nanosheets with high percentage of exposed 001 facets.The percentage of exposed 001 facets was calculated based on the method reported in ref. 18. For G/TiO 2 -001/101 samples (Fig. 3F-I), the TiO 2 NCs with coexposed 001 and 101 facets were homogeneously dispersed on graphene nanosheets.The particle size of TiO 2 NCs on graphene is larger than that of pure TiO 2 NCs, indicating that the support of graphene contributes to the growth of TiO 2 NCs, which can be responsible for the higher intensity of TiO 2 XRD peaks of G/TiO 2 -001/101 samples.However, the increase of graphene content in the composites does not show obvious influence on the shape and size of TiO 2 NCs (Fig. 3F-I and Table 1), although XRD results show that increased graphene content can enhance the crystallinity of TiO 2 NCs, revealing that the content of graphene mainly affects the crystallinity of TiO 2 but not the size and shape of TiO 2 NCs.In addition, the TiO 2 -001/101 NCs attached on the graphene sheet have much better dispersion than that of pure TiO 2 -001/101 NCs, resulting from the intimate interaction between the hydrophilic function groups (e.g., -OH, -COOH) on GO and the hydroxyl groups on TiO 2 . 13This interaction helps the electron transfer from TiO 2 to graphene during the photoexcitation process. N 2 adsorption-desorption was applied to explore the textual properties of the prepared catalyst.The specific surface area, S BET was calculated according to the classical Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) theory and summarized in Table 2.It is obvious that the surface area of pure TiO 2 NCs decreased with the adding content of HF solution, which may be due to the larger crystallite size, as evident in the results of XRD and TEM.In addition, the surface areas of all graphene/TiO 2 composites are higher than pure TiO 2 NCs and increases with the increasing content of graphene.This is due to the extremely high surface area of graphene (theoretical value of 2600 m 2 g A1 ). 13 Fig. 4 shows the FTIR spectra of GO and 10 G/ TiO 2 -001/101.The broad peak at 3000-3500 cm A1 corresponds to the stretching vibrations of -OH and/or the physically adsorbed H 2 O on the catalyst. 23The peak at 1729 cm A1 is attributed to the CQO stretching vibration. 24The peaks at 1625 cm A1 , 1220 cm A1 ,and 1050 cm A1 are ascribed to CQC, C-O-C, and C-O stretching modes, respectively. 12Furthermore, the peak at 1570 cm A1 in the spectrum of 10 G/TiO 2 -001/101 is caused by the skeletal vibration of GO. 23 Raman spectroscopy is a powerful and nondestructive tool to characterize the crystalline phase of TiO 2 and the quality of graphene.Fig. 5 shows the Raman spectra of TiO 2 -001/101, GO, and G/TiO 2 -001/101 composites containing different amounts of graphene.For TiO 2 -001/101 and G/TiO 2 -001/101 composites, several characteristic bands at 146, 397, 516, and 637 cm A1 are attributed to the E g(1) , B 1g(1) , A 1g B 1g (2) , and E g(2) modes of anatase TiO 2 , respectively. 9Notably, the peak corresponding to the E g mode for the G/TiO 2 -001/101 composites is significantly red-shifted comparing to the TiO 2 -001/101 sample (Fig. 5, inset).It was reported that the shift of the Raman peak can be attributed to the strain developed on the G/ TiO 2 -001/101 surface and the phonon confinement effect because of the change in the crystal size of materials. 25In our work, the red shift of the E g peak indicates the larger crystal sizes of G/TiO 2 -001/101 composites than TiO 2 -001/101 samples. 26This is in line with the results of XRD and TEM, indicating a strong interaction between TiO 2 and graphene. The significant structural changes in GO during the solvothermal reaction process can also be reflected in the Raman spectra.There are two typical Raman bands, the D peak centered at 1346 cm A1 and the G peak at 1587 cm A1 , 24 found in GO and the composites.The former is common for disordered sp 2 carbon and the latter is due to the in-plane stretching motion of symmetric sp 2 C-C bonds.The composite showed an increased D/G intensity ratio comparing to GO, which indicates a decrease in the average size of the in-plane sp 2 domains of C atoms in the composite, 27 confirming the existence of graphene sheets in the G/TiO 2 -001/101 composites. 9,28n order to investigate the surface composition and the interaction between TiO 2 and graphene in G/TiO 2 -001/101 composites, the XPS spectra of TiO 2 -001/101 and G/TiO 2 -001/101 composites were recorded and are shown in Fig. 6.As shown in Fig. 6A, there are two peaks in the binding energy region of Ti 2p.The binding energy of Ti 2p 3/2 for each sample is around 459.4 eV, suggesting a normal state of Ti 4 in the TiO 2 . 29,30Comparing to the peak position of the TiO 2 -001/101 sample, the peaks of G/TiO 2 -001/101 composites show a shift to higher binding energy values.This phenomenon is most obvious in the 20G/TiO 2 -001/101 sample containing the largest amount of graphene.Similar results were reported elsewhere. 10The positive shift of Ti 2p spectra can be attributed to the strong interactions at interfaces between TiO 2 and graphene, resulting in the formation of electron transfer channels, 10,21 which benefits the transfer of excited electrons from the conduction band of TiO 2 to graphene during the photocatalytic process.Undoubtedly, this will enhance the photocatalytic activity of G/TiO 2 -001/101 composites. Fig. 6B shows the O 1s XPS spectra of TiO 2 -001/101 and G/TiO 2 -001/101 composites.The peaks at around 530.6 and 532.5 eV can be attributed to the lattice oxygen (Ti-O-Ti) of TiO 2 and the surface hydroxyl of TiO 2 and graphene, respectively. 12Similar to the Ti 2p spectra, a positive shift of the Ti-O-Ti peaks for G/TiO 2 -001/101 composites is also observed comparing to TiO 2 -001/101, which further proves the electron transfer between TiO 2 and graphene, resulting from their strong interactions. The C 1s XPS spectra of GO, RGO and G/TiO 2 -001/101 composites are exhibited in Fig. 6C.There are three peaks in the spectra of G/TiO 2 -001/101 composites, which are centered at around 284.5, 285.6, and 286.7 eV, respectively.The peak at 284.5 eV is assigned to the C-C, CQC, and C-H bonds in graphene, 12 and the peaks at 285.8 and 286.7 eV are attributed to the C-O and CQO bonds in graphene. 8Comparing to the XPS spectrum of GO, a negative shift of the C 1s peaks of G/TiO 2 -001/101 samples can also be observed, again demonstrating the electron transfer from TiO 2 to graphene.It is worth noting that the intensity of oxygen-containing functional groups of RGO and G/TiO 2 -001/101 samples decreased obviously, demonstrating that GO has been converted to graphene.This is in line with the results of FTIR that GO was partially reduced to graphene through the solvothermal process.The reduction of GO during the solvothermal synthesis of TiO 2 /graphene composites has been reported before, 26,31 which can be attributed to the reduction of GO by solvent 32 and/or the reaction between the Ti-containing intermediate and the graphene surface, leading to the covalent attachment of TiO 2 . 31The formation of C-O-Ti bonds may involve the reaction of TiO 2 with oxygen-containing groups on the surface of graphene, such as COOH and CQO groups. 31,33The reaction of TiO 2 intermediates with these groups can account for the low contents of oxygen-containing groups found in the G/TiO 2 -001/101 samples. The fluorescence of the semiconductor is caused by the recombination of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs, thus the PL spectra have been widely used to investigate the recombination rate of electron-hole pairs in the semiconductor.As shown in Fig. 7A, the fluorescence intensity of TiO 2 -001/101 is the lowest among the pure TiO 2 NCs, indicating that the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs can be suppressed by optimizing the ratio of 001 and 101 facets.This is due to the appropriate ratio of 001 and 101 facets can enhance the spatial separation of photogenerated electrons and holes.However, the higher percentage of exposed 001 facets can work as recombination centers and inhibit the separation of charges. 18When TiO 2 NCs were deposited onto graphene, the fluorescence intensity of G/TiO 2 -001/101 dramatically decreased, indicating that graphene can further restrain the recombination of photogenerated electronhole pairs on TiO 2 NCs due to the transfer of photogenerated electrons from TiO 2 to graphene. 34This result is consistent with the results of XPS.With the ratio of graphene increased from 5 to 20, the PL intensity of G/TiO 2 -001/101 becomes even lower.Fig. 7B further shows that the PL intensity of G/TiO 2 -001/101 catalysts at 550 nm depends linearly on the TiO 2 content in the composites, demonstrating that with the grapheme content increased from 5 to 20, the decreased PL intensity of G/TiO 2 -001/101 is mainly caused by the decreasing TiO 2 content in the composites.The electron transfer from TiO 2 to graphene in G/TiO 2 -001/101 samples is not obviously accelerated with the graphene content increased from 5 to 20. Before the experiment, a series of background tests were conducted to confirm that any carbon-containing compounds in the effluent gas measured by the GC indeed originated from CO 2 through photocatalytic reactions.First, tests were conducted using CO 2 and water vapor as the purging and reaction gases: (1) empty reactor and (2) reactor with a Petri plate but no catalyst in it.No carboncontaining compounds were detected in the dark or under UV irradiation in these two cases.This demonstrated that the CO 2 reduction could not proceed without a photocatalyst.Second, Ar (instead of CO 2 ) and water vapor were used as the purging and reaction gases in the presence of a photocatalyst.No carboncontaining compounds were produced under UV irradiation.This indicated that the CO 2 was the only carbon source. CO and CH 4 were found to be the main photocatalytic products and no H 2 was detected, suggesting H 2 was involved in the reduction of CO 2 .Fig. 8 shows the CO and CH 4 yields of pure TiO 2 NCs and G/TiO 2 composites under the following reaction conditions: photocatalyst, 10 mg; reaction temperature, 120 1C; molar ratio of H 2 O/CO 2 , 0.21, light source, 300-400 nm; irradiation time, 4 h.Among the pure TiO 2 NCs enclosed by different facets, TiO 2 -001/101 has the highest photocatalytic activity, with a CO and CH 4 yield of 9.73 and 7.95 mmol g A1 h A1 (Fig. 8A), which are about 1.5 times and 3.4 times higher than that of TiO 2 -101, respectively.It is notable that although the surface area of TiO 2 -001/101 is smaller than that of TiO 2 -101, the specific activity of the former one is much higher than that of the latter one (as shown in Table 2), indicating that the enhanced activity is not caused by the surface area.Therefore, the high activity of TiO 2 -001/101 can be attributed to the low recombination rate of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, as evident in PL spectra.When the TiO 2 NCs are irradiated under UV light, the valence band (VB) electrons are excited to the CB, while the holes remain in the VB.For TiO 2 -101, most electrons and holes are easy to accumulate on the 101 facets due to the low percentage of 001 facets.As a result, the photogenerated electrons and holes easily recombine, leading to low conversion efficiency.For TiO 2 -001, the high percentage of 001 facets on the surface of TiO 2 may cause an electron overflow effect toward 101 facets, which makes it difficult for the electrons to migrate to 101 facets.As a result, the TiO 2 -001 has lower photocatalytic activity than TiO 2 -001/101.In the case of TiO 2 -001/101, it was reported that the coexposed 101 and 001 facets of anatase can form a ''surface heterojunction'' within TiO 2 particles, which is beneficial for the transfer of photogenerated electrons and holes to 101 and 001 facets, respectively. 18D'Arienzo et al. 35 further found that the concentration of trapped holes (O A centers) increases with the increase of the 001 surface area, while that of electron traps (Ti 3 centers) increases with the increase of the 101 surface area, indicating that the 101 facets act as the reductive sites, while the 001 facets are the oxidative sites.Namely, photogenerated electrons and holes are effectively separated.In addition, D'Arienzo et al. 35 reported that the concentration of photogenerated defects (Ti 3 ) over 101 facets is also important to the activity of TiO 2 , because Ti 3 can easily transfer trapped electrons to reactants, which can account for the higher activity of TiO 2 -101 than TiO 2 -001.While based on the highest activity of TiO 2 -001/101, it can be speculated that comparing to photogenerated defects, the formation of a ''surface heterojunction'' is a more significant reason for the enhanced activity of TiO 2 -001/101. When TiO 2 NCs were loaded on graphene, the photocatalytic activity of all the G/TiO 2 composites significantly increased compared to that of pure TiO 2 NCs no matter which facet is exposed (as shown in Fig. 8B).For example, the CO yield of 10G/TiO 2 -101 and 10G/TiO 2 -001 are 41.0 and 28.0 mmol g A1 h A1 , which are about 6.2 and 6.5 times higher than that of TiO 2 -001 and TiO 2 -001, respectively.Considering that graphene has no photocatalytic activity, the reason for the enhanced activity is that the support of graphene facilitates the electron migration from the 101 or 001 facets of TiO 2 to graphene so that the recombination of electrons and holes is restrained.In addition, the enhanced surface area of G/TiO 2 composites and good dispersion of TiO 2 NCs on graphene can also contribute to the high activity of G/TiO 2 composites.It is notable that the CO and CH 4 yield of 10G/TiO 2 -101/001 is 70.8 and 27.4 mmol g A1 h A1 , respectively, which are both higher than those of 10G/TiO 2 -101 (57.4 and 17.2 mmol g A1 h A1 ) and 10G/TiO 2 -001 samples (28.0 and 9.0 mmol g A1 h A1 ).Based on the results of pure TiO 2 NCs, this demonstrates that the spatial separation of photogenerated charge carriers on TiO 2 NCs still have obvious influence on the activity of G/TiO 2 composites.In other words, the photogenerated electrons and holes on TiO 2 NCs can first separate from each other by migrating to different facets, and then the electrons on 101 facets are able to transfer to graphene, thus the photogenerated electron-hole pairs are more effectively separated, resulting in enhanced photocatalytic activity of the G/TiO 2 -101/001 catalyst. The effect of graphene amount on the activity was also investigated (Fig. 8B).The photocatalytic activity of G/TiO 2 -001/ 101 composites increased with the graphene amount increasing from 5 to 10.This can be attributed to the increased surface area caused by the increasing graphene amount.However, the photocatalytic activity of G/TiO 2 -001/101 composites decreased when the graphene amount increased to 20 even though the recombination rate of photogenerated charges is still decreasing.This may be caused by decreased content of TiO 2 , which is the active component in the composites. The selectivity of CO 2 reduction into CO and CH 4 has been discussed in various papers. 36,37Eight electrons and eight protons are needed to generate one molecular CH 4 while the formation of one molecular CO only requires two electrons and two protons.Therefore, enough supply of electrons and protons benefits the production of CH 4 . 3637738 In this study, the enhancement of CH 4 yield of TiO 2 -001/101 (comparing to TiO 2 -101) is more evident than that of CO.This can be explained by the high density of electrons on the 101 facets of TiO 2 -001/101, resulting from its effective separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs and decreased exposed area of 101 facets.Different from the effect of co-exposure of 101 and 001 facets, the support of graphene obviously enhanced the production of CO.A possible explanation is that excited electrons on G/TiO 2 -001/101 samples prefer to transfer to graphene and thus, CO 2 reduction reaction mainly happens on the surface of graphene.However, the adsorption of water on graphene was suppressed due to large amounts of oxygencontaining groups on graphene were removed during the solvothermal process.Thus, the supply of protons was not enough for the generation of CH 4 , resulting in preferred production of CO.Quantum efficiency of the CO 2 photocatalytic conversion on pure TiO 2 NCs and G/TiO 2 -001/101 samples was calculated by the following equations 39 and listed in Table 2.For TiO 2 -001/101, the quantum efficiency was calculated to be 0.0077 and 0.0250 for CO and CH 4 , respectively, and the total quantum efficiency was 0.0327 for CO 2 photocatalytic reduction. For 10G/TiO 2 -001/101 catalysts, the quantum efficiency was calculated to be 0.0557 and 0.0864 for CH 4 and CO, respectively, and the total quantum efficiency was 0.142 for CO 2 photocatalytic reduction, which is much higher than that of TiO 2 -001/101.The high photocatalytic activity of the G/TiO 2 -001/101 catalysts could be ascribed to the high surface area, good dispersion of TiO 2 NCs on graphene, and low recombination rate of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs. On the basis of the above experimental results, a simple mechanism was proposed to explain the enhanced photocatalytic activity of G/TiO 2 -001/101 catalysts (Fig. 9).When the catalyst was irradiated by UV light, the photogenerated electrons on TiO 2 NCs tend to transfer to the 101 facets while the excited holes prefer to the 001 facets.Thus, the spatial separation of photogenerated charges on TiO 2 NCs is achieved.Then the electrons accumulated on 101 facets can migrate to graphene due to the high work function of graphene. 40Consequently, the photogenerated electron-hole pairs are more effectively separated.Finally, the CO 2 reacts with the electrons on graphene to generate hydrocarbons and meanwhile, H 2 O was oxidized to O 2 by the holes on the TiO 2 NCs.In a word, the synergy of graphene supports and co-exposure of different facets results in the enhanced photocatalytic activity of G/TiO 2 -001/101 catalysts."}]}}
