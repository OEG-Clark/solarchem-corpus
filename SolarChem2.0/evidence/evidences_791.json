XRD measurements were carried out to investigate the phase structure and composition of all samples.In Fig. 2a, two obvious diffraction peaks of g-C 3 N 4 at 2 13.2(100) and 27.4(002) are observed, which correspond to the in-plane intervals of periodic tri-striazine and the interplanar stacking of aromatic systems, respectively (Lu et al., 2018;Chen et al., 2015).The new peaks observed on the XRD pattern of the Mo/g-C 3 N 4 hybrid can be indexed to Mo (PDF No. 42-1120) (Denny et al., 2010), indicating the successful deposition of Mo nanospheres on the surface of g-C 3 N 4 through a simple solvothermal process.The coverage density of the Mo nanospheres on the g-C 3 N 4 surface can be easily controlled by regulating the amount of g-C 3 N 4 used during the solvothermal process (Fig. S2a).Furthermore, the (100) peak of g-C 3 N 4 in the hybrid is not shifted compared to that of pure g-C 3 N 4 (Fig. S2b), suggesting that Mo is not doped into the lattice of pristine g-C 3 N 4 (Wang et al., 2019). FTIR spectrum (Fig. 2b) of the pure g-C 3 N 4 shows the typical stretching vibration bands belonging to CeN heterocycles (1200-1650 cm -1 ), NeH (3100-3300 cm -1 ), and the breathing mode of s-triazine ring units (811 cm -1 ).These IR bands indicate that the chemical structure of g-C 3 N 4 has not been destroyed after exfoliation (Li et al., 2017b).Compared with the IR spectrum of pure g-C 3 N 4 , the IR spectrum of the Mo/g-C 3 N 4 hybrid exhibits a weak shift to lower wavenumber in the vibration peak position of the s-triazine rings, and the shift is increased with the decrease of the g-C 3 N 4 amount in the Mo/ g-C 3 N 4 hybrid (Fig. S3).This result shows that chemical interactions exist at the interface of Mo and g-C 3 N 4 (Zhang et al., 2019b), giving rise to the structural distortion of g-C 3 N 4 (Zhang et al., 2017). To confirm how the Mo nanospheres are bonded on the g-C 3 N 4 surface, XPS measurements were performed.For pure g-C 3 N 4 , the C 1s spectrum (Fig. 2c) shows three distinct peaks at 284.6, 286.1, and 288.2 eV, indexed to the sp 2 CeC bonds of graphitic carbon, sp 3 -bonded carbon, and sp 2 -bonded carbon, respectively.Similarly, the N 1s spectrum exhibits three major peaks at 398.5, 399.0, and 400.5 eV, attributed to the sp 2 -bonded N (CeNC), tertiary nitrogen groups, and amino groups (Fig. 2d), respectively, further confirming the formation of g-C 3 N 4 .After the loading of Mo nanospheres onto the surface of g-C 3 N 4 , both C 1s and N 1s peaks of g-C 3 N 4 are shifted to higher binding energies.These results suggest that electron transfer occurs from g-C 3 N 4 to Mo nanospheres.The electron transfer process is most likely to take place at the Mo/g-C 3 N 4 interface, leading to reduced and increased electron screening effects for g-C 3 N 4 and Mo, respectively (Huang et al., 2018).The peaks at 235.82 eV and 232.65 eV in the Mo 3d spectrum of Mo/g-C 3 N 4 (Fig. S4a) are attributed to Mo 3d 3/2 and Mo 3d 5/2 , respectively, in MoO x .The O 1s spectrum of Mo/g-C 3 N 4 (Fig. S4b) shows the related binding energy for MoO x (Anwar et al., 1989).These results imply that the surface of Mo is inevitably oxidized.Note that no zerovalence-state Mo is detected probably due to the limited detection depth of XPS.The XPS results confirm the strong synergistic effect between Mo and g-C 3 N 4 , which leads to the electron transfer process at the interface during the photocatalytic reaction. UV-vis-NIR spectroscopy was used to investigate the light absorption properties of the as-synthesized samples.As shown in Fig. 3a, the pure g-C 3 N 4 has an intrinsic absorption edge located at 467 nm, suggesting a band gap of 2.65 eV.This provides a strong evidence that the loading Mo nanospheres onto the g-C 3 N 4 surface can give rise to a full-spectrum absorption.Therefore, the Mo/g-C 3 N 4 hybrids were measured for photocatalytic CO 2 reforming to CH 4 .The photocatalytic activity of the Mo/g-C 3 N 4 hybrid (6.0 mol g -1 h -1 ) for CH 4 evolution is 3.2 times higher than that of pure g-C 3 N 4 (1.9 mol g -1 h -1 ) (Fig. 3b).Furthermore, the amounts of CH 4 evolution of the Mo/g-C 3 N 4 hybrids are largely dependent on the amount of Mo nanospheres loaded on the surface of g-C 3 N 4 (Fig. S5).The loading contents of Mo (at.) in the Mo/g-C 3 N 4 catalysts as measured by XPS are shown in Table S1.Upon visible-light ( 420 nm, Fig. 3c) irradiation, the enhancement factor defined as the ratio of CH 4 evolution rate between the Mo/g-C 3 N 4 hybrid (3.8 mol g -1 h -1 ) and pristine g-C 3 N 4 (1.5 mol g -1 h -1 ), decreases to 2.5.It can be deduced that the broadened spectral region results in a weakened excitation of semiconductor, leading to reduced charge transfer at the interface of Mo and g-C 3 N 4 .Unexpectedly, when the spectral region is further extended to the NIR region ( 800 nm, Fig. 3d), the Mo/g-C 3 N 4 hybrid also exhibits a passable photocatalytic activity for CH 4 evolution with a rate of 1.9 mol g -1 h -1 .This proves that the Mo nanospheres can work as a cocatalyst to collect the interfacial charge in the Mo/g-C 3 N 4 hybrid for promoting the charge carrier separation of g-C 3 N 4 (Wang et al., 2012;Varghese et al., 2009).As a result, the hybrid possesses a full-spectrum-driven photocatalytic activity of CH 4 evolution.Besides, the recycling test (Fig. S6) indicates that the photocatalytic CH 4 evolution activity of the Mo/g-C 3 N 4 hybrid is nearly constant after three cycles for 24 h, suggesting the outstanding stability and activity of the hybrid photocatalyst. It is widely accepted that the introduction of transition metals into semiconductors contributes to light absorption and CO 2 adsorption with activation (Wang et al., 2018).As shown in Fig. 4a, the introduced Mo nanospheres promote higher CO 2 adsorption for g-C 3 N 4 , which is beneficial for enhancing both electron transfer and photocatalytic activity. The kinetics of charge transfer of g-C 3 N 4 and Mo/g-C 3 N 4 samples were studied by transient photocurrent responses.Fig. 4b reveals that the transient photocurrent of g-C 3 N 4 increases rapidly once exposed to light.Interestingly, after several cycles of intermittent on-off irradiation, the photocurrent remains steady and reproducible.The Mo/g-C 3 N 4 hybrid exhibits a stronger photocurrent response than the pure g-C 3 N 4 , indicating the photo-induced electrons can rapidly transfer from g-C 3 N 4 to Mo nanospheres, thereby restricting the direct recombination of electrons and holes. To further verify the effect of the Mo nanospheres, PL measurements were carried out on both g-C 3 N 4 and Mo/g-C 3 N 4 samples.It is wellknown that PL can study the efficiency of charge carrier separation and transfer in semiconductors (She et al., 2017).The PL spectra in Fig. 4c shows an apparent decrease in the characteristic peak of g-C 3 N 4 (466 nm) after the loading of Mo nanospheres.Furthermore, the time-resolved fluorescence decay curves of the Mo/g-C 3 N 4 hybrid and pure g-C 3 N 4 were also measured.As shown in Fig. 4d, the 1 (2.9 ns) and 2 (23.8 ns) values for the Mo/g-C 3 N 4 hybrid are longer than those of pure g-C 3 N 4 ( 1 2.6 ns; 2 18.4 ns).The average fluorescence lifetime of g-C 3 N 4 (14.1 ns) is prolonged to 18.5 ns after the loading of Mo nanospheres.The decreased PL intensity and increased fluorescence lifetime provide strong evidence for the accelerated electron transfer and suppressed recombination of charge carriers by decorating Mo nanospheres on the surface of g-C 3 N 4 (Zhang et al., 2017). Based on the above results, the possible mechanism for the photocatalytic CO 2 reforming to CH 4 over the Mo/g-C 3 N 4 hybrid is proposed in Fig. 5.The photocatalytic CO 2 reforming process generally involves three main processes (I) CO 2 adsorption and activation; (II) carriers excitation and transfer to the surface; (III) photocatalytic reaction (Zhang et al., 2019b).For pure g-C 3 N 4 , the low light absorption and CO 2 adsorption, the low separation efficiency of charge carriers, and the high reaction barrier, remarkably limit its photocatalytic activity.The introduction of Mo nanospheres to the g-C 3 N 4 surface causes increased CO 2 adsorption for enhancing the photocatalytic activity.Upon illumination, the surface temperature of Mo/g-C 3 N 4 is higher than that of pure g-C 3 N 4 (Fig. S7), indicating that the loading of Mo nanospheres activates the adsorbed CO 2 and decreases the CO 2 reduction barrier via a photothermal effect (Li et al., 2019b).Furthermore, the decorated Mo nanospheres can trap the photo-induced charge carriers to restrict the recombination of charge carriers, thereby leading to the overall improvement in photocatalytic activity.Moreover, the loading of Mo nanospheres remarkably extends the absorbance edge to 800 nm, which contributes to the NIR photocatalytic CO 2 reforming to CH 4 (Yang et al., 2018)."}, {"llm generation": "g-C 3 N 4", "source": "In summary, Mo nanospheres have been investigated as a novel cocatalyst for g-C 3 N 4 to enhance the photocatalytic CO 2 reforming to CH 4 .", "context": "In summary, Mo nanospheres have been investigated as a novel cocatalyst for g-C 3 N 4 to enhance the photocatalytic CO 2 reforming to CH 4 .SEM, FTIR, and XPS characterizations prove that the Mo nanospheres are well-bonded to the g-C 3 N 4 surface.The loaded Mo nanospheres can increase the adsorption and photo-activation of surface CO 2 .The studies of the transient photocurrent, PL and the time-resolved fluorescence decay indicate that Mo nanospheres with finely designed configuration can trap photo-induced electrons and prevent the recombination of charge carriers.At the same time, Mo nanospheres can broaden the absorption spectra of g-C 3 N 4 beyond 800 nm.Such unique properties of Mo nanospheres lead to superior photocatalytic CH 4 evolution activity.These findings may encourage further researches on the design and preparation of efficient cocatalytic materials for photocatalytic CO 2 reforming and many other energy conversion systems.

A facile solvothermal method was employed to prepare the Mo/g-C 3 N 4 hybrid.Briefly, H 2 O 2 (150 L) was first added into a 50 mL Teflon container containing 10 mg of Mo powder.Next, ethanol solution (29 mL) was added and magnetically stirred for at least 30 min to obtain an ethanolic solution of (MoO 2 (OH)(OOH) (Cheng et al., 2014).Following this, a certain amount of g-C 3 N 4 was resuspended into the above solution by ultrasonic treatment.The Teflon vessels were transferred into stainlesssteel autoclaves and heated at 140 C for 12 h.After naturally cooled to ambient temperature, the as-prepared product was collected by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 30 min, rinsed with ethanol three times, and finally dried under vacuum.The loading of the Mo nanospheres onto the surface of g-C 3 N 4 was controlled by adjusting the amount of g-C 3 N 4 used for the solvothermal process.The amount of g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets used was 10, 50, 100, 200, and 300 mg.In our case, we selected the sample synthesized using 200 mg g-C 3 N 4 as the optimum sample for further investigations, which is referred to as Mo/g-C 3 N 4 throughout this manuscript. The phase compositions of the samples were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Bruker D8 powder diffractometer with Cu-K radiation (1.5418A).Functional group characterizations of the samples were conducted using a Nicolet 6700 Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrophotometer.Morphological characterizations of the samples were performed using Carl Zeiss MERLIN scanning electron microscope (SEM) coupled with EDS mapping (Bruker QUANTAX 200 XFlash) at 10 kV.Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations were conducted with a JEM-2100 and Aztec Energy TEM SP X-MaxN 80T, respectively, at 200 kV.Surface elemental states of the products were checked by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) using a Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi spectrometer employing an Al-K source.The obtained XPS spectra were calibrated in reference to the binding energy of C 1s peak at 284.6 eV.The UV-vis-NIR (UV-vis-NIR) spectra were collected using a Hitachi U-4100 spectrophotometer.CO 2 adsorption isotherms were obtained using Micromeritics ASAP 2020.The photoluminescence (PL) spectra and time-resolved fluorescence decay spectra were collected using a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Model FL920, Edinburgh Instruments, UK) which employed a xenon (Xe) lamp with an excitation wavelength of 325 nm.The time-resolved fluorescence decay was calculated by the following equation (Liu et al., 2013): where 1 and 2 represent the fluorescence lifetime, A 1 and A 2 represent the relative amplitudes.The fluorescence lifetime 1 (short lifetime) was assigned to the non-radiative recombination of the photo-induced electrons with the surface defects; the fluorescence lifetime 2 (long lifetime) was derived from the bandgap charge-carriers recombination.Furthermore, the average fluorescence lifetimes were calculated according to the equation (Zhang et al., 2013): (2) The typical photocatalytic CO 2 reforming to CH 4 experiment was carried out with a Xe lamp (300 W) containing 100 mg of the photocatalyst.Briefly, a square glass (4 cm 4 cm) with the photocatalyst being spread equally, was placed horizontally in the center of a 492 mL cylindrical glass reactor.Next, some CO 2 gas (99.999 ) was aerated into the glass reactor with an airflow velocity of 0.3 L min -1 for 1 h to fill the reactor and exclude the other gas.Next, the photocatalyst was laid horizontally under the lamp at a distance of 10 cm to ensure direct irradiation on the catalyst.After that, deionized water (2 mL) was injected into the sealed reactor as a sacrificial agent for the holes.The glass reactor temperature was maintained within 28 C by the cooling system.Every 2 h, the gaseous mixture (400 L) was extracted from the reactor and immediately injected into a gas chromatograph.This chromatograph consisted of a flame ionization detector (FID) and a packed column, in order to evaluate the generated amount of CH 4 .The Xe lamp coupled with a UV cut-off filter ( 420 nm) was used to obtain the visible light.The NIR light was implemented by using the Xe lamp, coupled with a UV-vis cut-off filter ( 800 nm).

XRD measurements were carried out to investigate the phase structure and composition of all samples.In Fig. 2a, two obvious diffraction peaks of g-C 3 N 4 at 2 13.2(100) and 27.4(002) are observed, which correspond to the in-plane intervals of periodic tri-striazine and the interplanar stacking of aromatic systems, respectively (Lu et al., 2018;Chen et al., 2015).The new peaks observed on the XRD pattern of the Mo/g-C 3 N 4 hybrid can be indexed to Mo (PDF No. 42-1120) (Denny et al., 2010), indicating the successful deposition of Mo nanospheres on the surface of g-C 3 N 4 through a simple solvothermal process.The coverage density of the Mo nanospheres on the g-C 3 N 4 surface can be easily controlled by regulating the amount of g-C 3 N 4 used during the solvothermal process (Fig. S2a).Furthermore, the (100) peak of g-C 3 N 4 in the hybrid is not shifted compared to that of pure g-C 3 N 4 (Fig. S2b), suggesting that Mo is not doped into the lattice of pristine g-C 3 N 4 (Wang et al., 2019). FTIR spectrum (Fig. 2b) of the pure g-C 3 N 4 shows the typical stretching vibration bands belonging to CeN heterocycles (1200-1650 cm -1 ), NeH (3100-3300 cm -1 ), and the breathing mode of s-triazine ring units (811 cm -1 ).These IR bands indicate that the chemical structure of g-C 3 N 4 has not been destroyed after exfoliation (Li et al., 2017b).Compared with the IR spectrum of pure g-C 3 N 4 , the IR spectrum of the Mo/g-C 3 N 4 hybrid exhibits a weak shift to lower wavenumber in the vibration peak position of the s-triazine rings, and the shift is increased with the decrease of the g-C 3 N 4 amount in the Mo/ g-C 3 N 4 hybrid (Fig. S3).This result shows that chemical interactions exist at the interface of Mo and g-C 3 N 4 (Zhang et al., 2019b), giving rise to the structural distortion of g-C 3 N 4 (Zhang et al., 2017). To confirm how the Mo nanospheres are bonded on the g-C 3 N 4 surface, XPS measurements were performed.For pure g-C 3 N 4 , the C 1s spectrum (Fig. 2c) shows three distinct peaks at 284.6, 286.1, and 288.2 eV, indexed to the sp 2 CeC bonds of graphitic carbon, sp 3 -bonded carbon, and sp 2 -bonded carbon, respectively.Similarly, the N 1s spectrum exhibits three major peaks at 398.5, 399.0, and 400.5 eV, attributed to the sp 2 -bonded N (CeNC), tertiary nitrogen groups, and amino groups (Fig. 2d), respectively, further confirming the formation of g-C 3 N 4 .After the loading of Mo nanospheres onto the surface of g-C 3 N 4 , both C 1s and N 1s peaks of g-C 3 N 4 are shifted to higher binding energies.These results suggest that electron transfer occurs from g-C 3 N 4 to Mo nanospheres.The electron transfer process is most likely to take place at the Mo/g-C 3 N 4 interface, leading to reduced and increased electron screening effects for g-C 3 N 4 and Mo, respectively (Huang et al., 2018).The peaks at 235.82 eV and 232.65 eV in the Mo 3d spectrum of Mo/g-C 3 N 4 (Fig. S4a) are attributed to Mo 3d 3/2 and Mo 3d 5/2 , respectively, in MoO x .The O 1s spectrum of Mo/g-C 3 N 4 (Fig. S4b) shows the related binding energy for MoO x (Anwar et al., 1989).These results imply that the surface of Mo is inevitably oxidized.Note that no zerovalence-state Mo is detected probably due to the limited detection depth of XPS.The XPS results confirm the strong synergistic effect between Mo and g-C 3 N 4 , which leads to the electron transfer process at the interface during the photocatalytic reaction. UV-vis-NIR spectroscopy was used to investigate the light absorption properties of the as-synthesized samples.As shown in Fig. 3a, the pure g-C 3 N 4 has an intrinsic absorption edge located at 467 nm, suggesting a band gap of 2.65 eV.This provides a strong evidence that the loading Mo nanospheres onto the g-C 3 N 4 surface can give rise to a full-spectrum absorption.Therefore, the Mo/g-C 3 N 4 hybrids were measured for photocatalytic CO 2 reforming to CH 4 .The photocatalytic activity of the Mo/g-C 3 N 4 hybrid (6.0 mol g -1 h -1 ) for CH 4 evolution is 3.2 times higher than that of pure g-C 3 N 4 (1.9 mol g -1 h -1 ) (Fig. 3b).Furthermore, the amounts of CH 4 evolution of the Mo/g-C 3 N 4 hybrids are largely dependent on the amount of Mo nanospheres loaded on the surface of g-C 3 N 4 (Fig. S5).The loading contents of Mo (at.) in the Mo/g-C 3 N 4 catalysts as measured by XPS are shown in Table S1.Upon visible-light ( 420 nm, Fig. 3c) irradiation, the enhancement factor defined as the ratio of CH 4 evolution rate between the Mo/g-C 3 N 4 hybrid (3.8 mol g -1 h -1 ) and pristine g-C 3 N 4 (1.5 mol g -1 h -1 ), decreases to 2.5.It can be deduced that the broadened spectral region results in a weakened excitation of semiconductor, leading to reduced charge transfer at the interface of Mo and g-C 3 N 4 .Unexpectedly, when the spectral region is further extended to the NIR region ( 800 nm, Fig. 3d), the Mo/g-C 3 N 4 hybrid also exhibits a passable photocatalytic activity for CH 4 evolution with a rate of 1.9 mol g -1 h -1 .This proves that the Mo nanospheres can work as a cocatalyst to collect the interfacial charge in the Mo/g-C 3 N 4 hybrid for promoting the charge carrier separation of g-C 3 N 4 (Wang et al., 2012;Varghese et al., 2009).As a result, the hybrid possesses a full-spectrum-driven photocatalytic activity of CH 4 evolution.Besides, the recycling test (Fig. S6) indicates that the photocatalytic CH 4 evolution activity of the Mo/g-C 3 N 4 hybrid is nearly constant after three cycles for 24 h, suggesting the outstanding stability and activity of the hybrid photocatalyst. It is widely accepted that the introduction of transition metals into semiconductors contributes to light absorption and CO 2 adsorption with activation (Wang et al., 2018).As shown in Fig. 4a, the introduced Mo nanospheres promote higher CO 2 adsorption for g-C 3 N 4 , which is beneficial for enhancing both electron transfer and photocatalytic activity. The kinetics of charge transfer of g-C 3 N 4 and Mo/g-C 3 N 4 samples were studied by transient photocurrent responses.Fig. 4b reveals that the transient photocurrent of g-C 3 N 4 increases rapidly once exposed to light.Interestingly, after several cycles of intermittent on-off irradiation, the photocurrent remains steady and reproducible.The Mo/g-C 3 N 4 hybrid exhibits a stronger photocurrent response than the pure g-C 3 N 4 , indicating the photo-induced electrons can rapidly transfer from g-C 3 N 4 to Mo nanospheres, thereby restricting the direct recombination of electrons and holes. To further verify the effect of the Mo nanospheres, PL measurements were carried out on both g-C 3 N 4 and Mo/g-C 3 N 4 samples.It is wellknown that PL can study the efficiency of charge carrier separation and transfer in semiconductors (She et al., 2017).The PL spectra in Fig. 4c shows an apparent decrease in the characteristic peak of g-C 3 N 4 (466 nm) after the loading of Mo nanospheres.Furthermore, the time-resolved fluorescence decay curves of the Mo/g-C 3 N 4 hybrid and pure g-C 3 N 4 were also measured.As shown in Fig. 4d, the 1 (2.9 ns) and 2 (23.8 ns) values for the Mo/g-C 3 N 4 hybrid are longer than those of pure g-C 3 N 4 ( 1 2.6 ns; 2 18.4 ns).The average fluorescence lifetime of g-C 3 N 4 (14.1 ns) is prolonged to 18.5 ns after the loading of Mo nanospheres.The decreased PL intensity and increased fluorescence lifetime provide strong evidence for the accelerated electron transfer and suppressed recombination of charge carriers by decorating Mo nanospheres on the surface of g-C 3 N 4 (Zhang et al., 2017). Based on the above results, the possible mechanism for the photocatalytic CO 2 reforming to CH 4 over the Mo/g-C 3 N 4 hybrid is proposed in Fig. 5.The photocatalytic CO 2 reforming process generally involves three main processes (I) CO 2 adsorption and activation; (II) carriers excitation and transfer to the surface; (III) photocatalytic reaction (Zhang et al., 2019b).For pure g-C 3 N 4 , the low light absorption and CO 2 adsorption, the low separation efficiency of charge carriers, and the high reaction barrier, remarkably limit its photocatalytic activity.The introduction of Mo nanospheres to the g-C 3 N 4 surface causes increased CO 2 adsorption for enhancing the photocatalytic activity.Upon illumination, the surface temperature of Mo/g-C 3 N 4 is higher than that of pure g-C 3 N 4 (Fig. S7), indicating that the loading of Mo nanospheres activates the adsorbed CO 2 and decreases the CO 2 reduction barrier via a photothermal effect (Li et al., 2019b).Furthermore, the decorated Mo nanospheres can trap the photo-induced charge carriers to restrict the recombination of charge carriers, thereby leading to the overall improvement in photocatalytic activity.Moreover, the loading of Mo nanospheres remarkably extends the absorbance edge to 800 nm, which contributes to the NIR photocatalytic CO 2 reforming to CH 4 (Yang et al., 2018)."}, {"llm generation": "Gas", "source": "In summary, Mo nanospheres have been investigated as a novel cocatalyst for g-C 3 N 4 to enhance the photocatalytic CO 2 reforming to CH 4 .", "context": "In summary, Mo nanospheres have been investigated as a novel cocatalyst for g-C 3 N 4 to enhance the photocatalytic CO 2 reforming to CH 4 .SEM, FTIR, and XPS characterizations prove that the Mo nanospheres are well-bonded to the g-C 3 N 4 surface.The loaded Mo nanospheres can increase the adsorption and photo-activation of surface CO 2 .The studies of the transient photocurrent, PL and the time-resolved fluorescence decay indicate that Mo nanospheres with finely designed configuration can trap photo-induced electrons and prevent the recombination of charge carriers.At the same time, Mo nanospheres can broaden the absorption spectra of g-C 3 N 4 beyond 800 nm.Such unique properties of Mo nanospheres lead to superior photocatalytic CH 4 evolution activity.These findings may encourage further researches on the design and preparation of efficient cocatalytic materials for photocatalytic CO 2 reforming and many other energy conversion systems.

To confirm how the Mo nanospheres are bonded on the g-C 3 N 4 surface, XPS measurements were performed.For pure g-C 3 N 4 , the C 1s spectrum (Fig. 2c) shows three distinct peaks at 284.6, 286.1, and 288.2 eV, indexed to the sp 2 CeC bonds of graphitic carbon, sp 3 -bonded carbon, and sp 2 -bonded carbon, respectively.Similarly, the N 1s spectrum exhibits three major peaks at 398.5, 399.0, and 400.5 eV, attributed to the sp 2 -bonded N (CeNC), tertiary nitrogen groups, and amino groups (Fig. 2d), respectively, further confirming the formation of g-C 3 N 4 .After the loading of Mo nanospheres onto the surface of g-C 3 N 4 , both C 1s and N 1s peaks of g-C 3 N 4 are shifted to higher binding energies.These results suggest that electron transfer occurs from g-C 3 N 4 to Mo nanospheres.The electron transfer process is most likely to take place at the Mo/g-C 3 N 4 interface, leading to reduced and increased electron screening effects for g-C 3 N 4 and Mo, respectively (Huang et al., 2018).The peaks at 235.82 eV and 232.65 eV in the Mo 3d spectrum of Mo/g-C 3 N 4 (Fig. S4a) are attributed to Mo 3d 3/2 and Mo 3d 5/2 , respectively, in MoO x .The O 1s spectrum of Mo/g-C 3 N 4 (Fig. S4b) shows the related binding energy for MoO x (Anwar et al., 1989).These results imply that the surface of Mo is inevitably oxidized.Note that no zerovalence-state Mo is detected probably due to the limited detection depth of XPS.The XPS results confirm the strong synergistic effect between Mo and g-C 3 N 4 , which leads to the electron transfer process at the interface during the photocatalytic reaction. UV-vis-NIR spectroscopy was used to investigate the light absorption properties of the as-synthesized samples.As shown in Fig. 3a, the pure g-C 3 N 4 has an intrinsic absorption edge located at 467 nm, suggesting a band gap of 2.65 eV.This provides a strong evidence that the loading Mo nanospheres onto the g-C 3 N 4 surface can give rise to a full-spectrum absorption.Therefore, the Mo/g-C 3 N 4 hybrids were measured for photocatalytic CO 2 reforming to CH 4 .The photocatalytic activity of the Mo/g-C 3 N 4 hybrid (6.0 mol g -1 h -1 ) for CH 4 evolution is 3.2 times higher than that of pure g-C 3 N 4 (1.9 mol g -1 h -1 ) (Fig. 3b).Furthermore, the amounts of CH 4 evolution of the Mo/g-C 3 N 4 hybrids are largely dependent on the amount of Mo nanospheres loaded on the surface of g-C 3 N 4 (Fig. S5).The loading contents of Mo (at.) in the Mo/g-C 3 N 4 catalysts as measured by XPS are shown in Table S1.Upon visible-light ( 420 nm, Fig. 3c) irradiation, the enhancement factor defined as the ratio of CH 4 evolution rate between the Mo/g-C 3 N 4 hybrid (3.8 mol g -1 h -1 ) and pristine g-C 3 N 4 (1.5 mol g -1 h -1 ), decreases to 2.5.It can be deduced that the broadened spectral region results in a weakened excitation of semiconductor, leading to reduced charge transfer at the interface of Mo and g-C 3 N 4 .Unexpectedly, when the spectral region is further extended to the NIR region ( 800 nm, Fig. 3d), the Mo/g-C 3 N 4 hybrid also exhibits a passable photocatalytic activity for CH 4 evolution with a rate of 1.9 mol g -1 h -1 .This proves that the Mo nanospheres can work as a cocatalyst to collect the interfacial charge in the Mo/g-C 3 N 4 hybrid for promoting the charge carrier separation of g-C 3 N 4 (Wang et al., 2012;Varghese et al., 2009).As a result, the hybrid possesses a full-spectrum-driven photocatalytic activity of CH 4 evolution.Besides, the recycling test (Fig. S6) indicates that the photocatalytic CH 4 evolution activity of the Mo/g-C 3 N 4 hybrid is nearly constant after three cycles for 24 h, suggesting the outstanding stability and activity of the hybrid photocatalyst. It is widely accepted that the introduction of transition metals into semiconductors contributes to light absorption and CO 2 adsorption with activation (Wang et al., 2018).As shown in Fig. 4a, the introduced Mo nanospheres promote higher CO 2 adsorption for g-C 3 N 4 , which is beneficial for enhancing both electron transfer and photocatalytic activity. The kinetics of charge transfer of g-C 3 N 4 and Mo/g-C 3 N 4 samples were studied by transient photocurrent responses.Fig. 4b reveals that the transient photocurrent of g-C 3 N 4 increases rapidly once exposed to light.Interestingly, after several cycles of intermittent on-off irradiation, the photocurrent remains steady and reproducible.The Mo/g-C 3 N 4 hybrid exhibits a stronger photocurrent response than the pure g-C 3 N 4 , indicating the photo-induced electrons can rapidly transfer from g-C 3 N 4 to Mo nanospheres, thereby restricting the direct recombination of electrons and holes. To further verify the effect of the Mo nanospheres, PL measurements were carried out on both g-C 3 N 4 and Mo/g-C 3 N 4 samples.It is wellknown that PL can study the efficiency of charge carrier separation and transfer in semiconductors (She et al., 2017).The PL spectra in Fig. 4c shows an apparent decrease in the characteristic peak of g-C 3 N 4 (466 nm) after the loading of Mo nanospheres.Furthermore, the time-resolved fluorescence decay curves of the Mo/g-C 3 N 4 hybrid and pure g-C 3 N 4 were also measured.As shown in Fig. 4d, the 1 (2.9 ns) and 2 (23.8 ns) values for the Mo/g-C 3 N 4 hybrid are longer than those of pure g-C 3 N 4 ( 1 2.6 ns; 2 18.4 ns).The average fluorescence lifetime of g-C 3 N 4 (14.1 ns) is prolonged to 18.5 ns after the loading of Mo nanospheres.The decreased PL intensity and increased fluorescence lifetime provide strong evidence for the accelerated electron transfer and suppressed recombination of charge carriers by decorating Mo nanospheres on the surface of g-C 3 N 4 (Zhang et al., 2017). Based on the above results, the possible mechanism for the photocatalytic CO 2 reforming to CH 4 over the Mo/g-C 3 N 4 hybrid is proposed in Fig. 5.The photocatalytic CO 2 reforming process generally involves three main processes (I) CO 2 adsorption and activation; (II) carriers excitation and transfer to the surface; (III) photocatalytic reaction (Zhang et al., 2019b).For pure g-C 3 N 4 , the low light absorption and CO 2 adsorption, the low separation efficiency of charge carriers, and the high reaction barrier, remarkably limit its photocatalytic activity.The introduction of Mo nanospheres to the g-C 3 N 4 surface causes increased CO 2 adsorption for enhancing the photocatalytic activity.Upon illumination, the surface temperature of Mo/g-C 3 N 4 is higher than that of pure g-C 3 N 4 (Fig. S7), indicating that the loading of Mo nanospheres activates the adsorbed CO 2 and decreases the CO 2 reduction barrier via a photothermal effect (Li et al., 2019b).Furthermore, the decorated Mo nanospheres can trap the photo-induced charge carriers to restrict the recombination of charge carriers, thereby leading to the overall improvement in photocatalytic activity.Moreover, the loading of Mo nanospheres remarkably extends the absorbance edge to 800 nm, which contributes to the NIR photocatalytic CO 2 reforming to CH 4 (Yang et al., 2018)."}]}}
