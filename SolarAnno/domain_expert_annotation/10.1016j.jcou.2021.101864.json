The photocatalysts are synthesized by the sol-gel method and characterized by various techniques to study their physical and chemical properties.The dark adsorption experiments for these as-prepared photocatalysts were carried out in the airtight gas cell from vacuum to different pressure gradients with CO 2 at ambient temperature by the transmission mode of FTIR measurements.Moreover, the associated intermediate species of CO 2 hydrogenation were identified by diffusive reflectance infrared techniques (DRIFT).By using CO 2 temperature programmed desorption (TPD) analysis, the higher CO 2 adsorption capacity of m-TiO 2 /-Fe 2 O 3 heterojunction (0.054 mmol/g) was confirmed than that of the -Fe 2 O 3 (0.017 mmol/g) and m-TiO 2 (0.015 mmol/g).",

To sol-gel synthesize mesoporous TiO 2 , a beaker of urea solution where 13 g of urea is dissolved in 60 mL of DI water was first prepared.And then, 3 mL of Titanium isopropoxide was added to the solution dropwise.The gel mixture was stirred at 60 C for 6 h and then cooled down to room temperature.The obtained white color product was washed with DI water to remove unreacted residuals, and the sample was collected through centrifugation.Finally, the sample was dried at C for 12 h and thermally treated at 550 C for 4 h.The product was given the name m-TiO 2 and later being carried out characterizations and CO 2 reduction reactions.A similar synthesis procedure was applied to the synthesis of -Fe 2 O 3 by replacing Titanium isopropoxide with 1.5 g of FeCl 3 .6H 2 O. The sol-gel synthesis of m-TiO 2 /-Fe 2 O 3 heterojunction was taken place in a beaker filled with urea solution (25 g of urea dissolved in mL of water).3 mL of Titanium isopropoxide was added dropwise into the solution, followed by 1.5 g of FeCl 3 .6H 2 O.The gel mixture was stirred at 60 C for 6 h and then cooled down to ambient temperature.The obtained product was washed with DI water to remove unreacted residuals and was collected through centrifugation.Finally, the sample was dried at 90 C for 12 h and thermally treated at 550 C for 4 h.The product was given the nomenclature, m-TiO 2 /-Fe 2 O 3 , further characterizations, and CO 2 reduction reaction. A series of characterization methods were applied to study the synthesized samples in detail.The crystal structures of the-TiO 2 , -Fe 2 O 3 , and m-TiO 2 /-Fe 2 O 3 powders were investigated by the X-ray diffractometer (XRD) with Cu-K radiation ( 1.5406A).The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface analysis was scrutinized using Micromeritics (ASAP 2020) BET analyzer.The structural and morphology of the as-synthesized samples were studied by the scanning electron microscope (SEM; S-3000 H).The High-Resolution TEM (HRTEM) images were obtained by the JEOL JEM-2010 transmission electron microscopy at 200 kV.The element composition was recorded on the energy dispersive spectrum EDS (HORIBA, X-act).The valence band X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS-VB) was performed by using JPS-9030, JEOL XPS.The photocurrent and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out on Autolab PGSTAT 128N using Ag/AgCl as reference and Pt wire as counter electrodes respectively. The dark adsorption experiment was carried out in the transmission mode by a JASCO FT-IR 4600 spectrometer equipped with a Mercury Cadmium Telluride (MCT) detector.The sample was pressed into a selfsupporting disk (20 mm diameter, ca.50 mg) and placed in an IR cell attached to a gas-phase closed circulatory system for the observation.The sample was pretreated at 423 K for 3 h under vacuum and then probed by a fixed amount of CO 2 vapor from 5 to 500 Pa at ambient temperature.After the dark adsorption at 500 Pa, the system was then evacuated to vacuum again to remove free CO 2 and other free carbonyl species to investigate the chemically adsorbed CO 2 species on the samples. DRIFT experiments were conducted at 300 C with the DRIFT reaction chamber (Harrick, HVC-DRM-5) equipped in the mid-FTIR (Perkin Elmer, Frontier).The experiments were carried out in the range of 500 cm -1 to 4000 cm -1 with a resolution of 4 cm -1 .The samples (40 mg) were positioned in a cell equipped with two ZnSe windows for infrared beam pass and one CaF 2 observation window.The dried nitrogen gas was purged in the cell for 20 min to remove moistures and impurities before the background spectrum of the sample was acquired.Subsequently, the high purity of CO 2 continuously passed through a water bubbler was directed into the chamber at 10cc/sec for 120 min.The raw data of IR absorbance (A) was collected as a single-beam spectrum that reflects the detector response of the spectrometer in IR frequencies.The single-beam intensity (I SB ) and reference-beam intensity (I 0 ) are given by A log I 0 /I SB . 36. The temperature-programmed desorption of carbon dioxide (CO 2 -TPD) was operated and analyzed by Catalyst Analyzer BELCAT II (MICROTRAC Co., German) to monitor the CO 2 temperature-dependent desorption profiles.The CO 2 adsorption capacity of as-synthesized samples will be obtained by the integration of the desorption profile.The samples of 50 mg were pre-treated at 400 C under helium gas (10 sccm) for 1 h, followed by the adsorption of CO 2 at 50 C for 30 min.Then the desorption procedure was programmed from 50 to 600 C at the rate of 10 C per minute using helium as a carrier gas with a 30 sccm purging rate.",

            "paragraph_text": "The crystal structures of m-TiO 2 , -Fe 2 O 3, and m-TiO 2 /-Fe 2 O 3 heterojunction were confirmed by X-Ray Diffraction analysis (Fig. 1a).The diffraction peaks of m-TiO 2 could be indexed to the ratio of anatase and rutile 92:8, respectively 33.The phase of -Fe 2 O 3 was compared to the JCPDS no.39-1346 35.The pristine m-TiO 2 and -Fe 2 O 3 phases were identified with available phase index; however, the noticeable peaks at 25.29 (101) and 27.49 (110) belong to the m-TiO 2 .Also, the peaks at 36.22 (110) and 54.48 (116) belong to the -Fe 2 O 3 , which confirmed the formation of m-TiO 2 /-Fe 2 O 3 heterojunction.Moreover, the crystal structures of the as-prepared samples were further confirmed with Raman analysis shown in Fig. 1b.The Raman peaks appeared at 144, 395, 530, and 652 cm -1 and are assigned to the E g , B1 g , A1 g, and E g phonon modes of TiO 2 .As well, the -Fe 2 O 3 Raman peaks were raised at 227, 295, 407, 494, and 607 cm -1 , which are labeled as A1 g , E g , E g , A1 g , and E g phonon modes, respectively 36,41.The Raman modes of m-TiO 2 /-Fe 2 O 3 heterojunction showed broad peaks yielded by pristine m-TiO 2 and -Fe -Fe 2 O 3, and m-TiO 2 /-Fe 2 O 3 heterojunction catalysts surface morphology, particle size, and shape have been investigated using SEM (Fig. 2) and HRTEM analysis (Fig. 3).It was observed that the surface morphology is influenced mainly by urea.Fig. 2a andb exhibit that porous TiO 2 is formed as a coral-like structure, which leads to high porosity and the largest surface area 42,43.Moreover, the cross-section image reveals information about the three-dimensional specimen structure.However, Fig. 2c andd TiO 2 and its cohered catalysts can implement CO 2 hydrogenation under UV irradiation based on the literature mentioned above.The heterogeneous reaction starts from the adsorption of reactants from the vapor phase and, subsequently, the surface reaction.The activation energy of the overall reaction is contributed by both the activation energy of mass transfer limitation at the adsorption/desorption steps and the activation energy from the surface intrinsic kinetics.An airtight gascell FTIR accessory with 15 cm pathlength for transmission mode measurements was used to analyze the extent of interactions between adsorbates and photocatalysts, which contributed to the mass transfer mechanisms.Fig. 4 illustrates the FTIR spectra probed by CO 2 from 5 to 500 Pa at ambient temperature.After the CO 2 adsorption at 500 Pa was completed, the system was evacuated to vacuum again to remove the free CO 2 and free carbonate species.The evacuated spectrum was symbolized as \"evac\" in Fig. 4.This information provides strong evidence of the formation of chemical adsorption bonding between our samples and carbonate species.The peaks are assigned following the reference 4445464748.The IR spectra of m-TiO 2 (Fig. 4a andb) show that no significant absorption peaks were noticed from 1800 to 1100 cm -1 and from 3800 to 2600 cm -1 at various CO 2 pressure gradients.This result indicates a very weak interaction between CO 2 vapor molecules and adsorbent m-TiO 2, and no significant vibration signals corresponding to the hydrogen bond of the catalysis surface carbonate groups were observed.However, the IR spectra of -Fe 2 O 3 (Fig. 4c andd) inhibited significant adsorption of CO 2 on -Fe 2 O 3 .In Fig. 4c, two negative peaks were observed.The signals (v(OH)) are related to the differently coordinated isolated hydroxyl groups of oxide being consumed by the formation of bicarbonates (b-HCO 3 -) 41.The broad slope below 3500 cm -1 is assigned to the interacting hydroxyl groups of the bicarbonates 48.Fig. 4d features the bands related to the (bi)carbonate groups adsorbed on -Fe 2 O 3 .The sharp band at 1210 cm -1 is related to the (OH) vibrational signals of monodentate and bidentate bicarbonates (m-HCO 3 -and b-HCO 3 -).The broadband at 1675 cm -1 and 1325 cm -1 represented the asymmetric vibrational signals (v as (CO 3 )) and the symmetric vibration signal (v s (CO 3 )) of formation of the adsorbed bridged carbonates (br-CO 3 ) respectively 44454647.The band at around 1625 cm -1 is ascribed to the asymmetric vibrational signals (v as (CO 3 )) of both monodentate and bidentate bicarbonates (m-HCO 3and b-HCO 3 -) 44454647.However, the significant bands at 1400 cm -1 , identified as the symmetric vibration signal (v s (CO 3 )) of the monodentate bicarbonates (m-HCO 3 -), implied that the bicarbonate groups belonged to monodentate on the -Fe 2 O 3 .In the case of heterojunction m-TiO 2 /-Fe 2 O 3 probed by CO 2 as shown in Fig. 4e and4f, completely different traits of bands were observed.Fig. 4e inhibited one negative peak that is related to the signal (v(OH)) of isolated hydroxyl groups of oxide being consumed by the formation of bicarbonates (b-HCO 3 -) 48.The sharp band and at 3620 cm -1 and the broad slopes at below 3500 cm -1 are assigned to the v(OH) of bidentate bicarbonate (b-HCO 3 -) and interacting hydroxyl groups of the bicarbonates, respectively 44454647.Fig. 4f features the bands related to the (bi)carbonate groups adsorbed on heterojunction m-TiO 2 /-Fe 2 O 3 .The sharp band at 1210 cm -1 is related to the (OH) vibrational signals of ).The band at around 1625 cm -1 could be an indication of the asymmetric vibrational signals (v as (CO 3 )) of both monodentate and bidentate bicarbonates (m-HCO 3 -and b-HCO 3 -).However, different from the -Fe 2 O 3 , a significant peak was observed at 1425 cm -1 representing the symmetric vibration signal (v s (CO 3 )) of the bidentate bicarbonates (b-HCO 3 -).Thus, we can conclude that in the case of heterojunction m-TiO 2 /-Fe 2 O 3, the formation of bidentate bicarbonate was flavored.Different (bi)carbonate species is preferred by the heterojunction m-TiO 2 /-Fe 2 O 3 and the -Fe 2 O 3 as shown in Fig. 4f and4d.Since the m-TiO 2 has trace CO 2 adsorption ability, the difference in the coordination of bicarbonate species between the two samples is occurred due to the changes in the coordination of Fe species.The heterojunction with TiO 2 will change the coordinates of Fe species in ambient conditions and leads to the tendency of forming bidentate bicarbonate (b-HCO 3 -).Thus, the dark adsorption FTIR analysis probed by CO 2 gave us a microscopic investigation of the interaction between our samples and the adsorbates, which helped us rationalize the photocatalytic performance of each sample in the next section. The mechanism of CO 2 reduction and its intermediate products were monitored by in situ DRIFT analysis.Fig. 5a shows the time-dependent DRIFT-IR absorbance spectra of m-TiO 2 /-Fe 2 O 3 heterojunction.The pristine m-TiO 2 /-Fe 2 O 3 spectra show surface hydroxyl group peaks of around 3500-3000 cm -1 and 1318 cm -1 .The surface hydroxyl groups on the catalyst were initially removed by thermal treatment at 300 C for 20 m in a nitrogen atmosphere.After removing the moisture, the CO 2 and H 2 O vapor passed into the drift cell at 300 C. The DRIFT-IR spectra were collected at time intervals (t) 15, 30, 45, and 60 min in the absence of light and the presence of light.The peaks appeared at 2354 cm -1 and 3700-3500 cm -1 , corresponding to the 3 and 3 1 stretching vibrations of adsorbed CO 2 , respectively.These peaks are referred to as CO 2 adduct formation on the m-TiO 2 /-Fe 2 O 3 heterojunction in the dark; however, during the UV-vis light irradiation, the CO 2 peaks (3700-3500 cm -1 ) were slowly decreased, and the C-H peaks were increased at 2927 cm -1 (Fig. 5a).In addition, the peaks that appeared at 1565 and 1364 cm -1 are correspond to the asymmetry and symmetry stretching frequency of HCOO-during the light irradiation, as shown in Fig. 5a 49.The time-dependent IR spectra were obtained by subtracting the absorbance spectra before CO 2 adsorption (At 0 min) from the absorbance spectra after t min of CO 2 adsorption (A t min) in the dark at 300 C, and also before UV light irradiation (TL 0) from the presence of light (UV light) t min (t 15, 30, 45 and 60 m), as shown in Fig. 5b.These spectra magnify the intensity of each IR feature showing positive (i.e., appearance) and negative (i.e., disappearance) bands, which indicate the formation and deformation of intermediate species, respectively 50,51.Accordingly, the specific peaks at 2927, cm -1 (asymmetric and symmetric C-H stretching frequency), and cm -1 (H 3 CO symmetric stretching) increase with increasing reaction time.Moreover, the firm peaks at 1563 and 1364 cm -1 also increased, corresponding to the asymmetry and symmetry stretching frequency of formate ion (HCOO-), respectively.The small peak was raised at cm -1 by increasing the reaction time, corresponding to the HCHO.From these observations, we have illustrated the mechanistic pathway of CO reduction given below. The above reaction step reveals that the CO 2 gas-phase is adsorbed on the m-TiO 2 /-Fe 2 O 3 surface 52.The electron-hole pair separation initiates the CO 2 reduction in the presence of light at 300 C.Moreover, the adsorbed CO 2 utilizes the generated electron from the conduction band and is converted as a COO -, after which the valence band generated by hydrogen and the oxidation of water can be produced as the formate ion (HCOO -).Furthermore, the formate ion reacts with the hydrogen ion and produces formaldehyde, and the formaldehyde undergoes hydrogenation to H 3 CO; then the H 3 CO reacts with hydrogen and produces methanol 535455. The DRIFT analysis demonstrated this reaction mechanism.The comparison study of CO 2 reduction is shown in Fig. 5c; the DRIFT spectra reveal the effective photocatalytic efficiency in the hydrogenation of CO 2 to CH 3 OH.The results (C-H peak intensity) indicate that the m-TiO 2 /-Fe 2 O 3 heterojunction was a more active catalyst than -Fe 2 O 3 and m-TiO 2 .This report reveals that the lower electron-hole pair recombination rate can enhance the reaction rate, confirmed by the PL, photocurrent and EIS results.Moreover, the thermal effect was evaluated at various temperatures under UV-vis light irradiation.The result reveals that the formation of methanol started to form at 200 C, as shown in Fig. 5d.However, the appearance of methanol was increased (identified from C-H peaks arising) by increasing the temperature.Therefore, this study suggests that high reaction temperature is more favorable with synergetic light energy.The cross-checking of methanol formation during CO 2 reduction was confirmed through the methanol adsorption on the catalytic surface at 300 C. The reference IR absorbance peaks were well matched with photocatalytic hydrogenation of CO 2 to methanol.In addition, the higher conversion rate of m-TiO 2 / -Fe 2 O 3 heterojunction is mainly because of the high CO 2 adsorption capacity of m-TiO 2 /-Fe 2 O 3 .The CO 2 adsorption capacity of the asprepared samples were characterized by CO 2 -TPD analysis.During the desorption procedure, the TCD signal was recorded along with the ramped desorption temperature as shown in Fig. 5f.The desorption peak area in the unit of mmol/g represented the CO 2 adsorption capacity and the results of three different samples were summarized in Table 1. Where, the m-TiO 2 /-Fe 2 O 3 heterojunction revealed higher CO desorption capacity of 0.054 mmol/g than m-TiO 2 (0.015 mmol/g) -Fe 2 O 3 (0.017 mmol/g) respectively.Moreover, the hydrogenation of CO 2 and the product selectivity of methanol over m-TiO 2 /-Fe 2 O 3 were compared with other reports.This study reveals that m-TiO 2 /-Fe 2 O performed well for the selective hydrogenation of CO 2 to CH 3 OH compared to that of different materials, as shown in Table 2. The band structures of the m-TiO 2 and -Fe 2 O 3 semiconductors are of important to deduce the mechanism of the heterojunction photocatalyst.The valence bands of the samples were derived from XPS-VB measurements and their corresponding conduction bands were estimated using Tauc plots from the UVDRS analysis (Fig. 1d).In Moreover, the EIS analysis was carried out to study the inter-facial charge transfer of the heterojunction composite.As shown in Fig. 6d, the Nyquist plot reveals three different semicircles of the samples at high frequency region.Among them, the m-TiO 2 /-Fe 2 O 3 shows a smaller semicircle of low impedance value than m-TiO 2 and -Fe 2 O 3. This in-turn affirms the fast and efficient charge transfer mechanism of the heterojunction composite.",

Fig.6a, XPS-VB spectra shows the derived valence bands of m-TiO 2 and -Fe 2 O 3 semiconductors are 2.64 and 1.95 eV respectively.By adding their bandgaps, the estimated conduction bands of m-TiO 2 and -Fe 2 O 3 are -0.26 and 0.10 eV respectively.From the above results, the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction mechanism is described in Fig.6b.Before contact, the band structures of m-TiO 2 and -Fe 2 O 3 are in their appropriate levels.Since the m-TiO 2 / -Fe 2 O 3 forming pn junction, band bending occurs as a result of built in electric field region and band levels of -Fe 2 O 3 are shifted negatively56,57.The adsorbed CO 2 molecules are reduced at the conduction bands of the m-TiO 2 /-Fe 2 O 3 and converted into CH 3 OH by selective hydrogenation.In addition to PL, the transient photocurrent experiments was performed to confirm the heterojunction system of m-TiO 2 /-Fe 2 O 3 composite.The photocurrent response of the samples are three hierarchic signals as shown in Fig.6c.The increased photocurrent response of the m-TiO 2 /-Fe 2 O 3 composite suggests that there is a presence of efficient charge transfer between m-TiO 2 and -Fe 2 O 3 .
