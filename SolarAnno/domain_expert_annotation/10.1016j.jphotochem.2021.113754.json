            "paragraph_text": "The binuclear complex C1 and its mononuclear analogue were designed and synthesized, respectively.The complex C1 contains two Co(TPA)ClCl moieties, as Co(TPA)ClCl is one of the most effective CoN 4 -type catalysts for CO 2 reduction 23,24.To avoid synergistic effect of two cobalt centers in C1 for CO 2 conversion like the successful example of binuclear Co cryptate complex reported by Lu et al. 2526272829 we covalently linked two Co(TPA)ClCl moieties to meta positions of a benzene by two rigid alkynyl groups.Firstly, two ligands, L1 or L2, were synthesized by Sonogashira coupling reaction of linking brominated tris (2-pyridylmethyl)amine (TPA-Br) to 1,3-diethylnylbenzene or phenylacetylene, respectively (Scheme 2).They were characterized by 1 H NMR, 13 C NMR, electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) and FT-IR spectra (Supplementary Information, SI).C1 and C2 were obtained by the reaction of CoCl 2 6H 2 O with corresponding ligand in methanol at room temperature, respectively.The ESI-MS spectra show the ion peak at m/z 925.0879 and 484.0823 (Figs.S3 andS4), which match well with C1 -Cl and C2 -Cl .UV-vis adsorption spectra of C1 and C2 (Fig. 1a) in DMF show the absorption of the ligand at 292 nm and 291 nm, respectively.Absorptions at 400-700 nm of C1 and C2 are ascribed to d-d transition of the metal center 23,24.The molar extinction coefficient () of the absorption peaks of C1 are twofold of those of C2 at the same concentration.These results demonstrate that the successful synthesis of C1 and C2.Structure optimization based on calculations revealed that the distance between two Co centers in C1 is 14.77 A (Fig. 1b). To investigate the photocatalytic activity of C1 and C2, systematic photocatalytic CO 2 reduction experiments were carried out.The system was established in a CO 2 -staturated DMF/TEA mixed solution (V DMF / V TEA 4/1, V total 5.00 mL) and irradiated for 5 h under blue LED lamp ( max 450 nm).At a condition of (sample E and F, Fig. 2a).The values of CO production selectivity of these samples are in the range of 93.5-97.3.At higher PS/Cat.ratios, the turnovers based on cobalt center of C1 are lower than those of C2.Presumably, two cobalt centers in C1 cannot be fully reduced by excited Ir(ppy) 3 at a lower PS/Cat.ratio if a synergistic catalysis mechanism can be excluded (discussed below).At a higher PS/Cat.ratio, two cobalt centers in C1 works to afford CO.However, steric effect emerging in the course of CO 2 reduction at two cobalt centers in C1 is considered to slightly lower catalytic efficiency of each cobalt center.This may explain the lower TON Co of C1 than that of C2 at a higher PS/ Cat.ratio. At the optimal condition of PS/Cat. 40 (PS 2.00 10 -4 M, C1 C2 5.00 10 -6 M), long time photocatalytic experiments were performed.Two systems of using C1 and C2 as a catalyst, respectively, continuously produced CO with high selectivity.At the initial stage, an induction period was observed, which is probably due to structural changes of the catalyst 333435.The C1 and C2 system produced CO with TON C1 721 (TON Co 360) and TON C2 369, respectively, after irradiation of 60 h.While C1 exhibits the almost similar catalytic activity to the mononuclear analogue C2, evalued by the cobalt centers.The C1-system maintains almost 2 times CO production of C2-system throughout the entire photocatalysis.The CO production selectivity of the two system is 91.5 for C1 and 91.4 for C2.The catalytic activity of CO production dramatically decreased after 40 h of photocatalysis, indicating at least one component in the system decomposed.After finishing the long time photocatalysis (60 h), extra Ir (ppy) 3 (2.00 10 -4 M) was added into the C1-system and the sample was irradiated for another 20 h.TON C1 241 (TON Co 120) for CO production was obtained.This result indicates that catalyst C1 was still robust.The main reason of CO production ceasing is the decomposition of Ir(ppy) 3 . To gain insights into the system, mechanism studies were performed.Cyclic voltammogram of C1 and C2 were conducted in DMF and CH 3 CN.Both complex C1 and C2 show reductive waves upon reductive scan under N 2 atomsphere in DMF or CH 3 CN (Fig. 3 and Fig. S9).The reduction peaks are more identifiable in DMF.For the complex C1, three successive reduction peaks emerge at -1.47 V, -1.61 V, and -1.91 V (Fig. 3a).For the complex C2, two reductiion peaks at -1.46 V and -1.89 V were observed (Fig. 3b).At the same complex concentration (0.5 mM) in CH 3 CN, the current density of C1 increase to 0.50 mA cm -2 at -1.59 V, which is two-times higher than that of C2 (0.25 mA cm -2 at -1.55 V).Constant-potential coulometry of C1 at -1.59 V gave a current decay to zero after 40000 s with n 2 (Fig. S10), demonstrating every molecule of C1 consumes two electrons at this potential.Based on above results and previous reports 1718192021222324, the reductive peaks at -1.47 V, -1.61 V, and -1.91 V of C1 are assigned to Co II Co II /Co II Co I , Co II Co I / Co I Co I , and ligand-centred reduction, respectively.The reductive peaks at -1.46 V and -1.89 V of C2 are correspondingly assigned to Co II /Co I and ligand-centred reduction, respectively.Under CO 2 atmosphere, both C1 and C2 showed an enhanced current density at the cobalt-centered reductive waves in comparison to those of under N 2 atmosphere (Figs. 3 andS9).Previous studies had been revealed that Co I species of CoN 4 complexes is the active species for CO 2 binding 171819202122.The current enhancement of C1 and C2 in CO 2 atmosphere is attributed to the electrocatalysis of CO 2 by Co I species generated by C1 and C2.The current density of C1 (0.70 mA cm -2 ) in CO 2 atmosphere is also two-fold of C2 (0.32 mA cm -2 ) in CV analysis in CH 3 CN (Figure S9).This indicates each of Co I species in C1 binding a CO 2 . To investigate the photoinduced electron transfer (PET) process between Ir(ppy) 3 and two cobalt complexes, C1 and C2, a series of emission quenching experiments were operated.The emission at 515 nm of Ir (ppy) 3 in degassed DMF (excitation wavelength 400 nm) can be effectively quenched by successive addition of C1 or C2 (Cat. 13 M -110 M) into the solution.According emission lifetime (1.47 s) of Ir (ppy) 3 recorded in literature, 18 the quenching rate constant k q for C1 and C2 is 4.37 10 9 M -1 s -1 and 3.46 10 9 M -1 s -1 , respectively (Fig. S7) 1718192021222324.The k q of C1 and C2 is not a two-fold relationship because the concentrations of cobalt complexes increase gradually in these quenching experiments.However, the k q of C1 is still showing a 1.3-fold improvement compared with that of C2.At an optimal PS/ Cat.ratio, a 4.92 and 2.08 emission area of Ir(ppy) 3 (5.00 10 -6 M) can be quenched by adding C1 (1.00 10 -3 M) and C2 (1.00 10 -3 M), respectively, with a same concentration (Fig. 4), the quenching efficiency of C1 is more than two-fold of C2 at this condition.This quenching efficiency improves to 3.51 by doubling C2 concentration (2.00 10 -3 M), which is still less efficiency than that of C1.Presumably, C1 having two cobalt centers improves local concentration at a molecular level, this leads more efficiency of C1 than that of C2 for quenching even at a same cobalt concentration.The reductive quenching of Ir(ppy) 3 by TEA was also conducted, it follows Stern-Volmer behaviour well with a k q of 1.71 10 7 M -1 s -1 (Fig. S8).The k q of TEA is far lower than that of C1 or C2, indicating a more effective oxidation quenching of Ir(ppy) 3 by the cobalt catalyst dominates in the photocatalytic system. The emission quenching between Ir(ppy) 3 and cobalt complexes is attributed PET from excited Ir(ppy) 3 to cobalt complexes, C1 or C2, because of no obvious overlap between the emission spectrum of Ir (ppy) 1) 40,41. Taking all results described above, a general mechanism of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction by C1 can be proposed.During photocatalysis, Ir (ppy) 3 is firstly excited upon visible light irradiation.The excited Ir (ppy) 3 molecules react with one C1 to generate a Co I Co I species in C1 via two successive PET processes.In consideration of the rigid structure and the large Co-Co distance in C1, the synergistic effect of two Co centers binding and stabilizing one CO 2 in the course of photocatalysis can be excluded 252627282930,31,40,41.Due to the large distance between two cobalt center in C1, each Co I species in C1 binds a CO 2 and subsequently convert it to CO (Scheme 3).In this process, steric effect between two cobalt centers probably exists and thus slightly affects catalytic activity of each cobalt center in C1.The CO 2 -to-CO conversion mechanism of Co I species had been studied and clarified based on DFT calculations in documents 171819202122.The Co I Co I species is the active species for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.The PS is reduced to PS by a sacrificial electron donor, TEA, which abundantly exists in the system 42.In this catalytic cycle, the complex C1 catalyses CO 2 -to-CO conversion by two catalytic sites independently, two metal centers are fully used for CO 2 transformation.",
