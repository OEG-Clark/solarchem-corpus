Initially, 0.64 gm PVP was added into 80 ml of ethylene glycol solution and kept for continuous stirring.To prepare Ag: Cu/ -Ga 2 O 3 , 0.063 gm of AgNO 3 (5 wt of -Ga 2 O 3 ), and 0.152 gm of Cu (NO 3 ) 2 3H 2 O (5 wt of -Ga 2 O 3 ) was added to 0.8 gm of -Ga 2 O 3 in an interval of 10 min (as shown in Scheme 1).The as-prepared solution was continuously stirred for two hours at room temperature.As a result, a milky-white solution was obtained, which was further transferred to a solvothermal reactor.The reactor was subjected to 140 C (ramp rate 1 C/minute) for 10 h.A brown-colored solution was collected, once the reactor was cooled to room temperature.The solution was then washed and centrifuged with ethanol and deionized water solution.Finally, the sample was kept in a vacuum drier for 12 h at 100 C. Similar procedure was followed to prepare 2Ag: Cu/ -Ga 2 O 3 and 3Ag: Cu/ -Ga 2 O 3 , where, the Ag content was 10 wt and 15 wt of -Ga 2 O 3 , respectively. The photo-activity of as-prepared catalysts was tested at ambient conditions to convert CO 2 into fuels by water under irradiation.Firstly, we deposited a thin film of as-synthesized photocatalyst on the concave wall of the reactor, details can be found elsewhere 27.In specific, the reactor was a two-neck round bottom quartz flask of volume 85 ml.The test gas was injected from one end and the product was analyzed from other end.The reactor was leak-free.Here, all the photocatalytic reactions were conducted for 12 h under illumination of a 500 W Xe arc lamp (Sciencetech, Canada).The lamp was stationed about 5.5 cm away from the film of photocatalyst.The reactor was completely covered with aluminum foil.Prior the start of experiment, caution was taken to avoid any oxygen contamination.In doing so, the ultrapure carbon dioxide gas stream was continuously flown through the reactor and valves were repeatedly on/off to vent off any undesired contaminants.Parallely, gases in the reactor was continuously monitored using a Gas Chromatograph (GC) (Centurion Scientific).Once the reactor was found to be oxygen-free, ultrapure carbon dioxide gas was directed through a water bubbler at room temperature.Of course, water bubbler was connected to the reactor and moist carbon dioxide gas was sent to the reactor for 30 min.Here, the flow rate was 5 ml/min, and was controlled by a mass flow controller (Aalborg Instruments, USA).After 30 min of gas supply, all valves were closed and 15 L of Milli-Q water was injected into the reactor.The reactor was further raised to 80 C for 15 min and then, the heater was turned-off to cool down the reactor to room temperature.Importantly, the reactor was then left under dark for 2 h to attain adsorption-desorption equilibrium of moist carbon dioxide gas with the thin film of as-prepared catalyst.Then, the reactor was illuminated and products were tested by GC.The GC is equipped with flame ionized detector, methanizer and thermal conductivity detector.Here, argon gas and molecular sieve was chosen was carrier gas and column material, respectively. To understand the interfacial behavior of the water-rich solution of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) at hydrophilic/hydrophobic surfaces at the molecular level, we considered a fully flexible model for CO 2 and water with TIP4P/2005.We modeled the non-bonded interaction between substrate and fluid by a 12-6 Lennard-Jones potential.Here, we considered graphite (AB stacking) as a substrate.The carbon-carbon non-bonded interaction parameters were taken from the ref.28 with CC 0.34 nm and CC 0.0556 kcal mol -1 .To address the hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity of a substrate, we varied the interaction strengths between carbon in graphite and oxygen in water ( COw 0.07, 0.105, 0.128, 0.148 kcal mol -1 ) with fixed COw 0.319 nm, 29 resulting different contact angle.Substrate/carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and water/ carbon dioxide interaction parameters were computed using the Lorentz-Berthelot arithmetic mixing rules.We considered a long range van der Waals tail correction to the total energy and pressure 30.A particle-particle particle-mesh (PPPM) K-space solver for TIP4P water was used to compute long-range Coulombic interactions with a precision of 10 -4 31.A cut-off distance of 0.85 nm was specified to the shortrange intermolecular potential terms.The bonds and angle of water were reset to the equilibrium length and angular values using the SHAKE algorithm. The model graphitic surface consists of four parallel graphene sheets with interlayer spacing and carbon-carbon bond distances: 0.335 nm and 0.142 nm, respectively.We placed water-CO 2 mixture on both sides of the surface with a box dimension of 5.156 nm 5.112 nm 8.75 nm.The simulation cell contained 66 CO 2 molecules and 6000 water molecules, resulting in a global mole fraction x CO2 0.011.We also performed a bulk simulation of water-rich aqueous CO 2 solution at x CO2 0.011 using 33 CO 2 molecules and 3000 water molecules.To determine to contact angle of water on graphene sheets, we built a surface with box dimensions of 20.168 nm 20.022 nm 20.00 nm and then placed 8000 water molecules on the surface. We carried out the constant volume and temperature (NVT) MD simulation with the different interaction strengths between water and surface to determine the contact angle of water on graphitic sheets.All the simulations were performed at 300 K with 4 ns equilibration and followed by additional 2 ns was used to compute the contact angle of water.The bulk density of aqueous CO 2 solution at x CO2 0.011 was evaluated using an isothermal-isobaric (NPT) ensemble at pressure P 25 atm and temperature T 304 K.We first equilibrated the system for 4 ns and an additional 2 ns production run was used to determine the density of the solution.The microscopic contact angle of a water droplet on a graphitic surface was computed using a graphical binning approach 32 and details were given in ref. 33. We performed the isochoric-isothermal ensemble (NVT) simulation to investigate the interfacial behavior of water-rich aqueous CO 2 solution on hydrophilic/ hydrophobic surfaces.Based on the bulk density at x CO2 0.011, the initial configuration for MD simulations of CO 2 -water mixture is generated by PACKMOL.Each simulation was carried out for 6 ns equilibrium and followed by 4 ns production run was used to analyze the density and orientation distributions. All the simulations were conducted using LAMMPS molecular dynamics Simulator 31.We used an integration time step of 2 fs for all the simulations.The pressure and temperature in the simulation cell was controlled through Nose-Hoover barostat and thermostat with a pressure and temperature damping parameter of 0.1 ps and 1 ps, respectively.The periodic boundary conditions (PBS) were applied in all the three directions and surface atoms were fixed during simulations.",

            "paragraph_text": "The XRD patterns of as-synthesized catalysts are provided in Fig. 1 (a).The pattern reveals that -polymorph of Ga 2 O 3 was formed after calcining Ga (NO 3 ) 3 H 2 O at 550 C for 4 h, which is consistent with the earlier report 16.IR discloses a band at 683 cm -1 which stems from the vibration of Ga-O bond in different co-ordinations of the lattice 34.Another peak at 480 cm -1 can be because of the vibration of Ga-O bond in GaO 6 octahedra (Fig. S1).Upon increasing the Ag and Cu content, obvious peaks of Ag at 2 values of 38.Nevertheless, all characteristic peaks corresponding to -Ga 2 O 3 were present, indicating that the composites were successfully synthesized without disrupting the basic structure and enhancing the intimate interaction of plasmonic bimetals with -Ga 2 O 3 .Critical to any catalyst, surface area, pore-volume, and the number of basic sites were also determined (Fig. S2-S4).In brief, the loading of bimetals decreased surface area and pore volume of pristine -Ga 2 O 3 , which could be attributed to the filling of pores of -Ga 2 O 3 by Ag and Cu nanoparticles. On the other hand, the strength of basic sites was increased after loading of bimetals, as is shown by CO 2 -TPD. A closer inspection of XRD patterns reveals the presence of weak peaks of Cu 2 O at 36.5 (1 1 1) and 42.5 (2 0 0) in the Ag, Cu-loaded -Ga 2 O 3 catalysts (Fig. 1(b)).Cu 2 O, a direct-gap semiconductor, efficiently absorbs visible light and is considered a good candidate for CO 2 reduction 35.Interestingly, herein, the formation of Cu 2 O decreases with the addition of AgNO 3 into the solution.Ag: Cu/-Ga 2 O 3 contains a relatively higher amount of Cu 2 O than other tested catalysts, which we further explore.Clearly, there is a direct relation of AgNO 3 with the reduction of Cu 2 ions.Such observation could be attributed to the higher reduction ability of Ag, as is evidenced from their electrode potential values (Ag e -Ag, In the presence of ethylene glycol which acts as a reducing Scheme 1. illustrates the synthesis procedures for loading of bimetals (Ag, Cu) on -Ga 2 O 3. agent, Ag can preferably reduce to Ag than Cu 2 to Cu and/or Cu 0 (Fig. 1 (c)).Consequently, Cu 2 ions are not readily reduced when a higher amount of AgNO 3 was used; therefore, 3Ag: Cu/-Ga 2 O 3 showed no peaks corresponding to Cu 2 O.It is worthy to note that Cu 2 preferentially reduces to Cu and not to Cu because of larger potential values.However, in this work, no Cu peaks were observed in the XRD.The possible reason for the low amount of Cu could be due to their quick oxidation to CuO and/or Cu 2 O in the presence of oxygen evolved during the decomposition reaction, facilitated by ethylene glycol 36.The lattice distance is 0.255 nm which matches with (0 0 2) plane of CuO nanoparticle 37 (Fig. 1 (d)) (see live FFT image, Fig. S5(a)).The Cu Kedge XANES was also performed for as-synthesized catalysts and compared with CuO standard sample (Fig. S5(b)).The absorption edge of the three catalysts matches very well with CuO indicating the 40.Importantly, this shift value was higher with higher Ag content.Moreover, the 3d doublet splitting energy of Ag3d is ca.6 eV, which could be due to the metallic Ag, as also evidenced from our XRD result (Fig. 1 (a)).Fig. 2 (d) demonstrates core-level spectra of Cu2p.The obvious peaks are at 932.6 eV and 952.4 eV for Ag: Cu/ -Ga 2 O 3 can be ascribed to Cu 0 /Cu 1 24.Since the spectra of Cu 0 and Cu 1 overlaps, it is difficult to unambiguously identify the two, given that the samples contain Cu 2 .A shift of 0.3 eV towards lower binding energy in Cu2p for 2Ag: Cu/ -Ga 2 O 3 catalysts indicates that the catalyst was more electron-rich with the increasing amount of Ag.Additionally, a satellite peak at 943.3 eV can be ascribed to the paramagnetic Cu 2 41.Nevertheless, under airexposure, re-oxidation of surface Cu 0 /Cu 1 to Cu 2 cannot be neglected during sample loading for XPS measurement.Consequently, the relative amount of surface copper ions on the catalysts could have been affected by air-oxidation. The element distribution over bare and plasmonic bimetallic loaded -Ga 2 O 3 was explored using TEM-EDX mapping analysis, as illustrated in Fig. 3(a-b).Apparently, all the elements were evenly distributed in the as-prepared catalysts (suppl.Fig. S7-S8).Furthermore, TEM was employed to get an in-depth understanding about structural characteristics of as-synthesized catalysts.Representative HRTEM images of -Ga 2 O 3 and 2Ag: Cu/ -Ga 2 O 3 are provided in Fig. 3 (c,j).As is evident, Ag and Cu nanoparticles were dispersed within -Ga 2 O 3 particles.Interestingly, a clear interface between (3 1 1) plane of Ag, (1 1 1) plane of Cu, and (0 2 0) plane of -Ga 2 O 3 is present, confirming their intimate contact.The lattice fringes from Fig. 3(c) are shown in Fig. 3(d-i).A clear view of d-spacing for (1 1 1) plane of Ag, (2 2 0) plane of Ag, (0 0 2) plane of -Ga 2 O 3 , (3 1 1) plane of Ag, (1 1 1) plane of Cu, and (1 1 1) plane of -Ga 2 O 3 are given.Similarly, d-spacing images of (0 2 0), (1 1 1), and (0 0 2) planes of -Ga 2 O 3 are provided in Fig. 3(k-m).Furthermore, corresponding live FFT images with d-spacings of 0.15 nm, 0.25 nm, and 0.28 nm are presented, which can be ascribed to the (0 2 0), (1 1 1), and (0 0 2) planes of -Ga 2 O 3 42 (Fig. 3(n-p)).Hence, we successfully embedded bimetallic plasmonic nanoparticles within the structure of -Ga 2 O 3 , which would facilitate charge-separation and extend the light absorption wavelength range via their intimate interfacial interactions. In future, we intend to investigate the role of different facet specific active sites in the catalysts for adsorption and photoreduction of CO 2 43. The optical properties of photocatalysts are vital to understand their photo-activity.Hence, the diffuse reflectance spectra for the tested catalysts were acquired and shown in Fig. 4 energies were then calculated using the Tauc Plot (see suppl.Fig. S9).The result suggests that all the catalysts absorb UV and visible light.In particular, calculated band gap of bare -Ga 2 O 3 was 4.5 eV, which reduced to 3.25 eV,2.55 eV, and 2.20 eV for Ag: Cu/ -Ga 2 O 3 , 2Ag: Cu/ -Ga 2 O 3 , and 3Ag: Cu/ -Ga 2 O 3 , respectively.Such reduction in the bandgap can be attributed to the enhanced light absorption capacity of bimetallic plasmonic particles.Interestingly, with the inclusion of Ag, a small but new absorption band centered at 500-530 nm can be clearly observed.Such peak can be attributed to the surface plasmon resonance effect of Ag nanoparticles decorated on -Ga 2 O 3 44.Notably, the shape and intensity of the peak vary with the amount, size, and oxidation states of Ag nanoparticles.As is evident, here, 2Ag: Cu/ -Ga 2 O 3 demonstrated the highest peak intensity.However, further increase in loading of Ag amount to -Ga 2 O 3 caused a lower absorbance value, which could be ascribed to the agglomeration of Ag nanoparticles, and the ratio of Ag and Ag 0 might be altered.Similarly, the effect of the introduction of Cu nanoparticles to -Ga 2 O 3 was also apparent in the absorption spectra.In particular, an extended absorption tail in the near-infrared region (750 nm) could be indicative of the surface plasmon resonance effect of Cu nanoparticles 45.Moreover, light absorption intensity was enhanced with the loading of Cu on -Ga 2 O 3 .The size and shape of plasmonic Cu nanoparticles decide the center of peaks.Here, the corresponding peak is centered at ca. 760 nm.Again, these findings confirm that both Ag and Cu were successfully included inside the -Ga 2 O 3 . The PL characterization was performed for exploring charge separation efficacy of as-synthesized catalysts Fig.4(b).The PL spectra were obtained at the excitation wavelength of 260 nm.The result divulges the relative intensity of all the catalysts, suggesting that 2Ag: Cu/ -Ga 2 O 3 showed the least intense peaks which means that the recombination events were substantially suppressed in these samples compared to bare -Ga 2 O 3 .Further, all the spectra were deconvoluted and results are presented in suppl.Fig. S10.Overall, the deconvolution illustrates that both the broad-band blue emissions and UV-emissions were present.In particular, deconvoluted peaks at 440 nm and 466 nm can be recognized as blue emissions, whereas, deconvoluted peaks at 305 nm, 333 nm, 353 nm, 370 nm, and 391 nm belong to UV-emissions 46.Overall, the UV-PL is comparatively less intense than the blue emission except for pristine -Ga 2 O 3 .In specific, the ratio of UV-PL and blue emission intensities were relatively higher for -Ga 2 O 3 followed by 3Ag: Cu/-Ga 2 O 3 (suppl.Fig. S10).However, other catalysts exhibited a lower ratio.In fact, the blue emissions in -Ga 2 O 3 samples could be assigned to the recombination of an electron on oxygen vacancies and a hole on gallium vacancies in the samples.On the other hand, recombination of electrons in the conduction band and a self-trapped hole results in UV-emissions.In summary, it is evident that the inclusion of plasmonic bimetals led to significantly reduce the recombination events, which could facilitate photo-activity. In order to check the interfacial charge-transfer behavior of the assynthesized catalysts, we present the Nyquist plots of EIS data (Fig. 4 (c)).The small arc radius in the plot refers to the efficient separation of photoinduced charge carriers and the easy supply of electrons for photoreduction of CO 2 with water.In the present study, 3Ag: Cu/ -Ga 2 O 3 demonstrates the least arc radius and therefore, offers the least resistance for charge-transfer, which is essential for improving the photo-activity.On the contrary, pristine -Ga 2 O 3 exhibits a lower efficiency in the separation of photogenerated charge carriers and hence, could not be an efficient photocatalyst. Next, we measured photocurrent responses of as-prepared catalysts to explore the efficiency of photoinduced charge carriers and the role of hot electrons in the Ag and Cu nanoparticles deposited on -Ga 2 O 3 (Fig. 4 (d)).For all the tested catalysts, the plot reveals that the photocurrent spontaneously increased under the light irradiation and then suddenly decreased to zero when the light was ceased, clearly indicating that as-synthesized catalysts demonstrate photoresponse.Firstly, the light-induced photocurrent of the optimum 2Ag: Cu/ -Ga 2 O 3 and bare -Ga 2 O 3 catalysts were estimated to be 0.4 Acm -2 and 0.05 Acm -2 , respectively.As can be seen, the photocurrent was increased by 8-folds upon the use of bimetals.Such enhancement in the photocurrent could be seen as a combined result of existing defects in the -Ga 2 O 3 and the generation of plasmon-induced hot electrons in the Ag and Cu nanoparticles.These photoinduced charge carriers can strongly absorb light and subsequently enhance the photocurrent. Based on the calculated energy band diagram, it appears that (a) the inclusion of bimetallic plasmonic nanoparticles elevated the E VB , and (b) the E CB of all tested catalysts were sufficiently negative to generate CO and CH 4 (Fig. S11).Upshifting in the E VB could indicate a higher reduction ability of the as-prepared catalysts.However, here, the band gap was also considerably reduced for catalysts with higher content of Ag and therefore, an apparent change in the E CB was not observed.Interestingly, these E CB values for the tested catalysts were negative to form CO and CH 4 .In particular, the E CB values for bare -Ga 2 O 3 (-0.703eV) was highest among the tested catalysts.But this was not directly translated to higher photo-activity owing to several other factors such as recombination events, photocurrent responses, and light absorption capacity.In the later section, we check the photo-activity of assynthesized catalyst to reduce CO 2 by water and further discuss a plausible mechanism. Firstly, a series of controlled experiments were conducted to examine if any organic contaminants or residue deposited on the reactor contributes to the product formation.The results (in suppl.Fig. S12) reveals that the product was generated only when light, photocatalyst, and moist CO 2 were concurrently present in the system.Moreover, no product was formed in absence of any of these, suggesting that the supplied CO 2 was only the source of carbon-containing products. The results in Fig. 5 depicts that total yields of CO, CH 4 , and H 2 for pristine -Ga 2 O 3 were 3.8molg -1 , 0.78molg -1 , and 1.4molg -1 , respectively after irradiation of 12 h.Interestingly, after inclusion of bimetals, the corresponding yields of products were considerably enhanced.For instance, 2Ag: Cu/ -Ga 2 O 3 catalyst demonstrated ca.1.81-folds higher CO formation rates than the pristine -Ga 2 O 3 .Also, similar behavior was noticed for hydrogen generation; wherein, the formation rate of hydrogen increased by ca.1.57-times than the bare -Ga 2 O 3 .However, further increases in Ag amount reduced the formation rate of products.Furthermore, selectivity for CO generation over as-prepared catalysts was calculated (details in supplementary).Regarding this, bare -Ga 2 O 3 and Ag: Cu/ -Ga 2 O 3 samples displayed comparable values for CO selectivity.The result discloses that 2Ag: Cu/ -Ga 2 O 3 exhibited the highest CO selectivity (ca.50), implying that Ag facilitates CO evolution.Previously, Pang et al. reported CO selectivity of 38.9 for Ag/ Ga 2 O 3 (1 mol.Ag) and was increased to 83.8 after the inclusion of Cr 47.In another liquid-phase study, CO selectivity was found to be 17.54 for 0.1 wt Ag/Ga 2 O 3 and 61.11 for 1 wt Ag/Ga 2 O 3 14.Interestingly, for 3Ag: Cu/ -Ga 2 O 3 , the formation rate of CO was decreased because of possible re-oxidation of CO to CO 2 and/or, agglomeration of Ag nanoparticles.Absence of Cu 2 O in 3Ag: Cu/ -Ga 2 O 3 catalyst could also contribute to the reduced photoactivity (Fig. 1(b)).On the other hand, Ag: Cu/ -Ga 2 O 3 sample showed the highest selectivity towards CH 4 formation, mainly owing to the Cu cocatalyst, as Cu is known to be effective for conversion of CO 2 to CH 4 in gaseous phase 24. Next, we discuss oxygen evolution during the reaction, which presupposes to be generated from the oxidation of water.Fig. S13 reveals that the evolution of O 2 for catalysts follows the sequence -Ga 2 O 3 2Ag: Cu/-Ga 2 O 3 Ag: Cu/-Ga 2 O 3 3Ag: Cu/-Ga 2 O 3 .This order is not in line with the photoreduction activity of these catalysts (Fig. 5), indicating that O 2 might be reabsorbed or remained on the catalysts surface, or the generated O 2 was re-consumed during the reaction 48495051. We postulate that the generated O 2 and/or O species could be consumed to (i) oxidize Cu /Cu 0 to form Cu 2 , and/or (ii) replenish oxygen vacancies (O v ) in the catalyst (See Schematic in Fig. S14).Since Cu /Cu 0 was absent in pristine -Ga 2 O 3 catalyst (Figs.123) and also, O v was relatively high in the catalyst (PL results, Fig. 4(b)), reconsumption sites in the form of O v were only available for produced O 2 .Consequently, the highest O 2 amount was observed for the -Ga 2 O 3 catalyst, despite their poor photoactivity.Comparing Ag: Cu-loaded -Ga 2 O 3 catalysts, an interplay between photoactivity, amount of Cu /Cu 0 species, and available O v govern the generation of overall O 2 .For instance, the enhanced CO 2 photoreduction activity of optimum 2Ag: Cu/-Ga 2 O 3 catalyst would produce more O 2 ; however, both Cu /Cu 0 species and O v were significantly existing in the sample that could eventually suppress the generation of O 2 .Earlier, Dong et al. 52 performed both experiments and first-principles calculations based on density functional theory to demonstrate that extra O 2 can significantly reduce O v in -Ga 2 O 3 .Similarly, in this work, an increase in the relative PL intensity of O v (blue emissions) comparing UV emissions was noticed after the reaction (Fig. S15).Note, blue emission peaks stem from the electron-hole recombination formed by O v 53,54.This implies that O v was reduced after reaction and could be because of reabsorption of O 2 and/ or O species, validating our hypothesis.Additionally, it appears that O v act as recombination sites. Additionally, Table S2 illustrates a comparative table for recently published work based on Ag-Ga 2 O 3 for CO 2 photoreduction with water. To check the stable performance of catalysts, we conducted cycle tests for the 2Ag: Cu/ -Ga 2 O 3 sample (Suppl.Fig. S16).The details of the procedure are provided in the experimental section.The cycle tests reveal that the formation rate of CH 4 was consistent for three cycles. A long life with consistent performance is strongly desired for any catalysts.Hence, it becomes important to investigate the structural and chemical characteristics of spent catalysts.In this regard, PL, FTIR, and XRD techniques were employed and corresponding results are provided in Suppl.Fig. S15, S17, S18.Noticeably, the spectral features of spent catalysts are identical to that of the pristine catalysts, inferring that the chemical structure remained unchanged even after their continuous and prolonged use.In the same line, XRD patterns of used catalysts demonstrate no emergence of any new peaks.However, the crystallite size of Ag nanoparticles increased from 26.85 nm to 47.83 nm (Fig. S19), which suggests that several small Ag nanoparticles agglomerate to form bigger particles and as a result, the CO formation rate was reduced (Fig. 5). To examine active intermediates of the reaction, time-dependent in situ DRIFTS spectra were acquired in the range of 1800-1300 cm -1 , which could help in understanding a plausible mechanism.To begin with, the as-prepared catalyst was initially heated to 150 C under vacuum for nearly 120 min to remove any surface adsorbed species.Further, the catalyst was subjected to a stream of 13 CO 2 bubbled through water for another 120 min.This step leads to attain adsorption-desorption equilibrium for 13 CO 2 over the catalyst surface.Then, a 500 W Xenon arc lamp was turned on to study the light-induced generation of intermediates. It is worthy to note that changes in spectral features seen from isotopic carbon-labelled in situ DRIFTS experiments would provide convincing information about the source of carbon-based products.As shown in Fig. 6, 13 COO -(at 1546 cm -1 ) quickly formed under light; suggesting that electrons on the surface of catalyst were transferred to 13 CO 2 to execute single-electron reduction (R1).Similar to our previous work 55 and Liu et al. 56, signals corresponding to H 13 CO 3 -(at 1389 cm -1 ) and b-13 CO 3 2-(at 1513 cm -1 ) apparently grew with irradiation time.In fact, the intensity ratio of H 13 CO 3 -and 13 COO -increased with time, implying the formation of intermediates for product(s) formation.Notably, these species may accept protons and electrons to form carbon monoxide, as shown in reactions (R2) and (R3). CO 2 e -CO - (R1) Similarly, experiments were also conducted over 2Ag: Cu/ -Ga 2 O 3 catalyst, and the resulting spectra are given in Suppl.Fig. S20.The results disclose identical spectral features to -Ga 2 O 3 .Hence, the findings from 13 C-labeled experiments provide conclusive evidence to realize Fig. 6.Time-profiled in situ DRIFTS spectra under 13 CO 2 atmosphere.The spectra are provided for -Ga 2 O 3 in the range of 1800-1300 cm -1 .Evidently, H 13 CO 3 -and b-13 CO 3 2-are predominantly existing with active intermediate, 13 COO -.The intensity of these species grew with irradiation time. that our engineered catalysts were able to photoreduce CO 2 by water.To summarize, we present a schematic diagram with details of protonelectron coupling for the photocatalyst (Fig. S21).Moreover, in situ DRIFTS study was also conducted under a 12 CO 2 atmosphere and corresponding results are provided in supplementary (Fig. S22-S26).These results also suggest that the defective surface of -Ga 2 O 3 can readily trap the photoinduced electrons and transfer them to the CO 2 molecules, which leads to the formation of COO -species.As is known, a large negative electrochemical potential (-1.9 V vs NHE at pH 7) is required for reduction of CO 2 to COO -.But thanks to defects in -Ga 2 O 3 which could effectively reduce the barrier and promote the activation of CO 2 on the surface. Furthermore, we conducted in situ ESR study of as-prepared catalysts to obtain information about unpaired electrons which can help in understanding the charge transfer mechanism.Clearly, a single Lorentzian line centered at g 2.01 indicates the presence of free electrons in O v of -Ga 2 O 3 .Importantly, O v can alter the electronic configuration of a semiconductor and also, facilitate the adsorption of CO 2 gas.In Fig. 7(a), the intensity of the same ESR signal was reduced under light irradiation, owing to the trapping of electrons in the shallow trap levels of O v .Therefore, these vacancies significantly enhance the CO 2 adsorption, govern the product distribution, and increase the charge-separation.Expectedly, after the inclusion of Ag and Cu, the signals were different (Fig. 7(b,c)).Nonetheless, the spectral pattern was independent of the Ag ion content, and possibly, the signals were too weak to be visible in the spectra obtained at room temperature.Hence, the signal centered at g 2.08 originates from paramagnetic Cu 2 ions, which accepts electrons to form diamagnetic Cu ion, which is more photoactive for CO 2 reduction Cu 2 e - Cu 57.Such phenomenon led to dampen the ESR signal, as is evident in (Fig. 7(b,c)).Notably, due to the short time of spin-lattice relaxation, the ESR signals from Cu metal are generally broad.But the ESR line was narrow for the sample containing a relatively higher concentrations of Cu ions which could be attributed to increased exchange interactions (Fig. 7(d)) 58. As mentioned earlier, the reduction of CO 2 was conducted in the presence of water vapor and light.Hence, it becomes logical to understand the interaction of CO 2 carrying water vapor with the surface of catalyst.To get an insight, we performed molecular dynamics (MD) study to explore the structure, orientation, and dynamics of water and carbon dioxide in water-rich aqueous CO 2 solution near model hydrophilic/hydrophobic substrate.Also, the MD simulations were used to compute the contact angle of water on the model surfaces at 300 K for the different carbon-water interaction parameters.The obtained values of contact angle were 24 2 , 37 2 , 55 2 , 112 3 for COw 0.148, 0.128, 0.105, and 0.07 kcal mol -1 , respectively.Next, we evaluated the density of the CO 2 -water mixture at 304 K and 25 atm.The simulated bulk density of the CO 2 -water mixture at x CO2 0.011 is 1002 5 kg m -3 , which is in excellent agreement with the experimental value 59.The diffusivity of CO 2 and water in the mixture are 2.51 0.31 10 -9 m 2 s -1 and 2.47 0.11 10 -9 m 2 s -1 , respectively; matching with the experimental value 60. In Fig. 8, number of CO 2 and water molecules along the direction normal to the surface are given.The distribution of carbon atoms in CO 2 (Fig. 8 (a,b) and oxygen atoms in water (Fig. 8 (c,d) on both sides of model surface for 24 and 55 ; indicate that both CO 2 and water molecules are layered within 0.5 nm from the plane of the surfaces and the substrate majorly governs the layering.The axial distributions of CO 2 and water in the CO 2 -water mixture depict an intense layering of CO 2 near hydrophobic surface, and the peak height decreases with increasing hydrophilicity of surface (Fig. 8 (e)).Whereas, a reverse phenomenon was observed for layering of water (Fig. 8 (f)).These results imply that fewer CO 2 molecules exist on relatively higher hydrophilic surface. Moreover, we also investigated the distribution of spatial orientation of interfacial CO 2 and water molecules near the surface.In Fig. S27 depicts the probability distribution of cos for CO 2 and water molecules within 0.5 nm from the surface.The angle is defined as the angle between the molecular axis of a CO 2 molecule and the interface normal (i.e., z-axis) for carbon dioxide; whereas, the dipole vector of water forms an angle with respect to the normal vector of the surface.The peak position at cos 0 demonstrates that the interfacial CO 2 molecules are preferentially oriented parallel to the solid-liquid interface for all the surfaces.In contrast, the peak positions were at cos -0.61 and 0.61 for left and right sides of the interfacial water, respectively.These positions infer that the preferred orientation of the water molecule has H atoms pointed outward the surface.Hence, the present findings suggest that there is no variation in orientation of interfacial CO 2 and water molecules with changing hydrophilicity of the model substrate. Importantly, we analyzed the average residence time of interfacial CO 2 and water molecules on different model surfaces.To do so, the autocorrelation function C R (t) M(t) M(0)/ M(0) M(0) was employed for molecules within 0.5 nm of the substrate.These interfacial molecules were initially present on the surface, which was represented as M (0) 1 at t 0.With time, these interfacial molecules left the surface; consequently, the correlation function decays from 1 to 0. Fig. 8 (g,h) shows the correlation function of interfacial CO 2 and water molecules on hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces.Interestingly, we found that for a surface with contact angle of 24 , the CO 2 molecules leave the interfacial layer faster than surface with higher contact angle (see Fig. 8 (g)).In case of water, the result discloses that exchange rate of interfacial water with the bulk along the direction normal to surface strongly depend on the hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity of the surface (Fig. 8 (h)). Based on the experimental and molecular simulation results, we present a plausible photocatalytic mechanism for the reduction of CO 2 to CO and CH 4 in the presence of water by bare -Ga 2 O 3 and Ag, Cu-loaded -Ga 2 O 3 .Fig. 9 illustrates the contact angle of water on Ag: Cu/ -Ga 2 O 3 and bare -Ga 2 O 3 .Apparently, pristine -Ga 2 O 3 exhibits superhydrophilicity (Fig. 9(b)).Whereas, the addition of co-catalysts increases the hydrophobicity.For instance, the contact angle of water on Ag: Cu/ -Ga 2 O 3 was (58.47 2) .Interestingly, the results of MD simulation provide us an insight into the dynamics of CO 2 in water on the hydrophilic/hydrophobic surface of photocatalyst.For instance, a large number of interfacial CO 2 molecules would be present in the vicinity of the surface of Ag: Cu/ -Ga 2 O 3 and also, the average residence time of these molecules would be higher, comparing bare -Ga 2 O 3 .Additionally, as the schematic depicts (in Fig. 9), photo-induced electrons in the conduction band of -Ga 2 O 3 would readily migrate to the Ag and Cu metal particles, which considerably enhances their chargeseparation efficacy (See Fig. 4(b)).These metals then trap the electrons which could be further consumed by the CO 2 molecules, resulting in the formation of COO -.COO -is a key active intermediate that undergoes several intermediate reactions to eventually form CO and CH 4 , as also evidenced from isotopic carbon-labelled in situ DRIFTS results using 13 CO 2 (Fig. 6).Moreover, Ag and Cu metals would significantly enhance the absorption of visible light using the SPR effect.On the contrary, pristine -Ga 2 O 3 suffers from the low number of charge carriers on its surface, owing to large band gap and high recombination events.These charge carriers are available only because of O v in -Ga 2 O 3 which act as trapping sites, also suggested by in situ ESR spectroscopy (Fig. 7 (a)).Moreover, the number of CO 2 molecules is relatively few, which would also stay for a lesser time on the surface.As a result, nearsurface CO 2 molecules would not efficiently consume photo-generated electrons and in turn, the photo-activity of the -Ga 2 O 3 was relatively less.Among the doped-catalysts, 2Ag: Cu/ -Ga 2 O 3 demonstrated the highest photo-activity under the operating conditions mainly owing to the combined effect of relatively higher surface area, lower recombination events, presence of Ag/ Cu 1 ions, large number of basic sites, and enhanced absorption of visible light. Importantly, oxidation states of Cu reversibly change from 2 to 0, after accepting electrons or releasing holes.Expectedly, these different states of Cu would differently respond to light.For instance, the LSPR effect would largely influence the Cu metal to absorb more of the light, which could subsequently lead to the formation of active 13 COO -ions.Notably, Cu metals are prone to oxidation and can quickly form outer oxide shells after exposure to ambient conditions.Such phenomenon yields a complex heterostructure comprising of semiconductor (Cu )metal (Cu 0 )-semiconductor(-Ga 2 O 3 ), which could considerably suppress recombination events and facilitate photo-activity. 18 (1 1 1), 44.25 (2 0 0), 64.72 (2 2 0), 77.4 (3 1 1) (JCPDS file no.89-3722) were observed.With increase in Ag content, the peak intensity of 200 plane at 2 44.25 of Ag become intense.The relative content of Ag and Cu in the tested catalysts are provided in Fig. 1.(a) X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern for as-synthesized catalysts.The bare Ga 2 O 3 was prepared by calcining Ga (NO 3 ) 3 H 2 O at 550 C for four hours.(i) The XRD pattern of bare Ga 2 O 3 resembles to its -polymorph (JCPDS file no.76-0573), denoted as -Ga 2 O 3 .(b) illustrates peaks corresponding to Cu 2 O (JCPDS file no.05-0667), which decreases with increasing Ag content in the catalyst.The plot shows XRD pattern for (ii) Ag: Cu/-Ga 2 O 3 , (iii) 2Ag: Cu/-Ga 2 O 3 , and (iv) 3Ag: Cu/ -Ga 2 O 3 .(c) unveils the possible formation mechanism inside the hydrothermal reactor.In the presence of ethylene glycol, a reducing agent, Ag and Cu 2 readily reduces to Ag and Cu 1 /Cu.(d) HRTEM image shows CuO nanoparticle present in 2Ag: Cu/-Ga 2 O 3 catalyst (inset: d-spacing image).The lattice distance matches with (0 0 2) plane of CuO.

Fig. 9. Contact angle measurement of water on (a) Ag: Cu/ -Ga 2 O 3 and (b) -Ga 2 O 3 .Schematic illustration of corresponding charge migration to the interfacial CO 2 molecules.The results unveil that addition of co-catalysts increases the hydrophobicity or contact angle of the -Ga 2 O 3 surface.Molecular dynamics simulations on water-rich aqueous CO 2 solutions reveal that the number of interfacial CO 2 molecules and the average residence time of CO 2 at the solid-liquid interface increase with the decrease in hydrophilicity of the substrate.Also, the recombination of photo-induced electron-hole pairs is comparatively less in Ag, Cu-loaded -Ga 2 O 3 .These findings clearly explain the reason for the increased photo-activity of Ag: Cu/ -Ga 2 O 3 .Additionally, the photo-induced electrons migrate to the co-catalysts (Ag, Cu), where the CO 2 molecules transform to CO 2 -and participates in further reactions to generate CO, H 2 , and CH 4 .These co-catalysts enhance the absorption of visible light using the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect.
