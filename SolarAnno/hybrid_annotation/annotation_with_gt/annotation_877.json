            "paragraph_text": "All chemicals and reagents used in this work were of analytical grade and used as received without further purification.Deionized (DI) water was used throughout for all types of experiments. The synthetic procedures for TS-1 nanosheets mainly refer to the previously reported work in our group 24. Firstly, melamine (10 g) and cyanuric acid (4 g) were dispersed in 500 mL DI water.The mixed suspension of cyanuric acid and melamine was stirred for 3 h at 80 C, then cooled to room temperature, centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 15 min, washed with DI water/ethanol for several times, and dried overnight at 80 C.The obtained dried powder was transferred into a closed quartz boat and heated from room temperature to 550 C with a heating rate of 5 C min -1 under air atmosphere.The primary porous CN sample was obtained after calcination for 4 h.The secondly-calcined porous CN sample was obtained by heating primary porous CN sample in semiclosed porcelain boat at 500 C for 2 h under air atmosphere.After natural cooling, the obtained fluffy CN was treated by 150 mL of 2 M HNO 3 .Then the solid was obtained after centrifuging, washing to neutral and drying processes to result in CN nanosheets.The surface hydroxylation of CN nanosheets was performed by ultrasonically treating 0.2 g of the synthesized pristine CN with 30 mL of aqueous H 2 O 2 solution (10 wt) under ultrasonic (FS20, Fisher Scientific) for 1 h.Furthermore, the sample was filtered and washed thoroughly with DI H 2 O and then dried at 60 C for 24 h. To fabricate CN/TS-1 nanocomposites, for each sample, 1 g of TS-1 was dispersed in a mixture of 20 mL of ethanol and 5 mL of DI water. Then different mass ratio percentage (i.e., 2, 5, 10, and 15) of CN nanosheets were also dispersed separately as that of TS-1 then added to each sample and kept under vigorous stirring and sonication separately for 2 h.After that, each sample was dried in oven at 80 C under continuous stirring and finally calcined at 500 C for 2 h with a heating rate of 2 C min -1 .As-obtained samples are noted as XCN/TS-1, (X indicates the loading amount by weight).Besides, 10hCN/TS-1 was synthesized as the same procedure only replacing CN with hCN. Metallic Ag with different mass ratio (i.e., 1, 1.5, and 2) was deposited onto 10hCN/TS-1 by the photoreduction method.In the first step, the desired amount of AgNO 3 and 1 g 10hCN/TS-1 were dispersed in a mixed solution of 50 mL methanol and 100 mL DI water in a 250 mL beaker covered with a sealing film.Then the samples were treated separately by sonication and stirring for 10 min.Furthermore, nitrogen gas was bubbled through the samples for 1 h to generate an inert atmosphere for the photodeposition of Ag nanoparticles.Then irradiated under a 300 W xenon lamp with a 420 nm cut-off filter for 3 h, under vigorous stirring.Finally, the samples were centrifuged and washed for three times with DI water followed by absolute ethanol, dried in air at 80 C, and finally samples were calcined for 40 min at 350 C.As-obtained samples are denoted as YAg/10hCN/TS-1 (Y indicates the loading amount by weight) The Powder XRD on an X-ray diffractometer (XRD) accomplished on a (Bruker D8, Germany) Advance diffractometer using Cu K radiation ( 0.15418 nm), at an accelerating voltage of 30 kV while the emission current of 20 mA was employed.The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-vis DRS) spectra were measured with a Shimadzu UV-2550 spectrometer using BaSO 4 as a standard.The morphology and structure of the samples were examined by Electron micrographs were taken on a JEOL JEM-2100 TEM operated at 200 kV while scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed on a Hitachi S-4800 microscope.The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas and average pore sizes of the samples were obtained by the Micromeritics Tristar II 3020 system (Atlanta, GA, USA).The samples had been degassed in the flow of N 2 at 180 C for 3 h prior to measurements.For the evaluation of the BET surface area ST-2000 constant volume adsorption apparatus was utilized.UV Raman spectra were recorded on a homemade UV-Raman spectrometer using a Jobin-Yvon T64000 triple-stage spectrograph with a spectral resolution of 2 cm -1 .The 290 nm line from a Coherent Innova 300 Fred laser was used as an excitation source.The power of the 290 nm line at samples was below 1.0 mW.Fourier transformed infrared (FT-IR) spectra of the samples were recorded on an FT-IR spectrometer (Nicolet Nexus 870) with a resolution of 4 cm -1 and 64 scans in the region of 4000-400 cm -1 .The steady-state surface photovoltage spectroscopy atmosphere-controlled (SPS) measurements of the samples were carried out with a home-built apparatus, equipped with a lock-in amplifier (SR830) synchronized with a light chopper (SR540, USA).The powder sample was sandwiched between two indium-tin-oxide (ITO) glass electrodes and the electrodes were kept in atmosphere-controlled sealed container.A monochromatic radiation was obtained from 500 W Xenon lamps (CHF XQ500W, Global Xenon lamp power) were passed through a double prism monochromator (SBP300) to get a monochromatic radiation. The transient-state surface photovoltage (TPV) response measurements were performed with a self-assembled device in air at room temperature, in which the sample chamber was connected to an ITO glass as the top electrode and to a steel substrate as the bottom electrode, and about 10 mm thick mica spacer was placed between the ITO glass and the sample to decrease the space charge region at the ITO sample interface.The samples were excited by a 355 nm laser radiation with 10 ns pulse width from a second harmonic Nd:YAG laser (Lab-130-10H, Newport, Co.).The laser intensity was modulated with an optical neutral filter and measured by a high energy pyroelectric sensor (PE50BF-DIFC, Ophir Photonics Group).The signals were registered by a 1 GHz digital phosphor oscilloscope (DPO 4104B, Tektronix) with an amplifier at the aid of a computer.The compositions and elemental states of the samples were confirmed through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) using a Kratos-Axis Ultra DLD apparatus with an Al (mono) X-ray source.During the measurement, process the binding energies of the samples were calibrated with respect to the signal for adventitious carbon with binding energy equal to 284.55 eV. The sample (0.05 g) was dispersed in 50 mL coumarin aqueous solution (0.001 M) in a beaker.Prior to irradiation, the reactor was magnetically stirred for 10 min to attain an adsorption-desorption equilibrium in dark.After irradiation for 1 h with a 150 W Xenon lamp (GYZ220 made in China), the sample was centrifuged, and then a certain volume of solution was transferred into a Pyrex glass cell for the fluorescence measurement of 7-hydroxycoumarin at 332 nm excitation wavelength with an emission peak wavelength at 460 nm through the above mentioned spectrofluorometer. PEC and EC measurements were performed in a traditional 3-electrode system.Prepared sample was used as the working electrode, a plate of platinum (99.9) was utilized as the counter electrode, a saturated KCl Ag/AgCl electrode was employed as the reference electrode, and 0.5 M Na 2 SO 4 solution as the electrolyte.Highly pure nitrogen gas (99.999) was bubbled through the electrolyte before and during the whole experimental procedure.PEC experiments were accomplished in a quartz cell using a 500 W xenon lamp as an enlightenment source.An IVIUM V13806 electrochemical workstation was employed to test photoelectrochemical and electrochemical performance of a series of catalysts.Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement was performed using a three-electrode configuration and carried out over the frequency range from 10 -2 to 10 5 Hz with amplitude of 10 mV (RMS) at the bias of 0.4 V.All the experiments were accomplished at room temperature (about 25 C). The CO 2 -TPD for desorption of CO 2 were performed by apparatus monitored Chemisorption Analyzer, TP 5080 Chemisorb which were equipped with a thermal conductivity detector.For each typical performance, about 50 mg of the sample was preheated at 300 C for 60 min to remove adsorbed gases including H 2 O molecules and then cooled down to 30 C under the ultrapure He with the flow rate of 30 mL min -1 .Subsequently highly pure O 2 gas was introduced at a 30 C with the O 2 flow rate of 40 mL min -1 for 6 min.The excess weakly physically adsorbed O 2 was then removed by exposure in the ultrapure He flow with the flow rate of 30 mL min -1 at 30 C for 60 min.Then the temperature was increased to 700 C with the heating rate of 10 C min -1 under the He flow rate of 30 mL min -1 . The sample (0.1 g) was dispersed in H 2 O (5 mL) with continuous magnetic agitation in a cylindrical steel lined reactor with volume of 100 mL and of 3.5 cm 2 area.A 300 W Xenon arc lamp was utilized as the illuminating source.Highly pure CO 2 gas was allowed to pass through water and then entered into the reaction assembly arrangement for the attainment of ambient pressure.The photocatalyst was allowed to equilibrate in the CO 2 /H 2 O system for 1 h and followed by irradiation for 4 h.During irradiation, about 0.25 mL of gas produced was taken from the reaction chamber at various time intervals for CO and CH 4 concentration analysis using a gas chromatograph (GC-7920 with TCD, Au Light, Beijing).",
