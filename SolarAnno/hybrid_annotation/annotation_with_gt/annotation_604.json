            "paragraph_text": "Cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) was supplied by Sigma-Aldrich.Tetrabutyl titanate (Ti(OBu)4, 98), hydrofluoric acid (47), sodium tungstate dihydrate (Na2WO42H2O), bismuth nitrate pentahydrate (Bi(NO3)35H2O), 3-aminopropyl-triethoxysilane (C9H23NO3Si, APTES), ethanol (C2H5OH), were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China).All materials were used as received without further purification.Deionized (DI) water used in the synthesis process was obtained from local sources. Anatase TiO2 nanosheets (denoted as TNS) were synthesized according to our previously reported method 42,43.Typically, 5 ml of Ti(OBu)4 and 1 ml of hydrofluoric acid solution were mixed in a dried Teflon autoclave with a capacity of 50 ml, and then kept at 453 K for 24 h.Caution!Hydrofluoric acid is extremely corrosive and toxic, and should be handled with extreme care.After being cooled to room temperature, the white powder was separated by centrifugation and washed with ethanol and DI water for several times.To functionalize the surface of TNS with positive charge, 0.4 g of the as-obtained TNS was first dispersed in 200 ml of ethanol by sonication for 30 min, followed by addition of 2 ml of APTES.Then, the mixture was kept at 333 K for 4 h with stirring.Afterwards, APTES functionalized TNS (A-TNS) were sufficiently rinsed with ethanol to remove the remaining APTES moiety and then dried at 333 K in an electronic oven for further use. Bi2WO6 nanosheets (denoted as BWO) were synthesized by the reported method 44.Typically, 1 mmol Na2WO42H2O, and 2 mmol Bi(NO3)35H2O and 0.05 g CTAB were added in 80 ml deionized water.After 30 min stirring, the mixed solution was poured into a 100 ml Teflon-lined autoclave.Then the autoclave was sealed into a stainless steel tank and treated at 393 K for 24 h.After being cooled to room temperature, the product was collected and washed several times with DI water and dried at 333 K in air for 10 h. Bi2WO6-TiO2 binanosheets (denoted as B-T) were prepared using an electrostatic self-assembly Typically, BWO aqueous suspension (0.5 mg ml -1 ) was added dropwise into A-TNS aqueous solution (1 mg ml -1 ) using a pipette under vigorous magnetic stirring.After being kept stirring at room temperature for 1 h, the B-T photocatalysts were isolated by filtration, washed with DI water and dried in an oven overnight at 333 K.The weight ratio of BWO in the B-T composite was 10.For comparison, the sample of physically mixed A-TNS and BWO was prepared by mixing them with a mortar keeping the weight addition ratio of BWO as 10. Zeta potentials () measurements of the samples were determined by dynamic light scattering analysis (Zeta sizer 3000HSA) at room temperature.The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples were collected on a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer with Ni-filtered Cu K radiation at 40 kV and 40 mA in the 2 ranging from 15 to 80 with a scan rate of 0.02 per second.Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) was used to characterize the morphology of the samples on a FEI Nova NANOSEM 230 spectrophotometer.Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images and elemental mapping results were obtained by a JEOL model JEM 2010 EX instrument at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV.The optical properties of the samples were analyzed by UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Cary 500, Varian Co.), in which BaSO4 was employed as the internal reflectance standard.The electrochemical analysis was conducted in a conventional three-electrode cell, which uses a Pt plate as the counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode.The working electrode was prepared on fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) glass that was cleaned by sonication in ethanol and dried at 353 K for 2 h.The boundary of FTO glass was protected using Scotch tape.The 5 mg sample was fully dispersed in 0.5 ml of DMF by sonication to get slurry.The slurry was spread onto the pre-treated FTO glass.After air drying, the working electrode was further dried at 393 K for 2 h to improve adhesion.Then, the Scotch tape was unstuck, and the uncoated part of the electrode was isolated with epoxy resin.The exposed area of the working electrode was 0.25 cm 2 .The photocurrent measurement was taken on a BAS Epsilon workstation with bias of 0.5 V under UV-vis light irradiation and the electrolyte was 0. Instrument F900 spectrophotometer with an excitation wavelength of 340 nm.To ensure the comparability of the PL spectra, the experimental parameters, including the excitation wavelength, slit width, and the amount of the samples, were identical. The photocatalytic reduction of CO2 was performed in a gas-solid heterogeneous reaction mode in a quartz reactor (volume, 25 ml).The loading mass of the photocatalyst sample was 20 mg. This system was evacuated by a mechanical pump and filled with pure CO2 gas.The evacuationfilling operation was repeated five times.0.5 ml of evacuated water was introduced finally with a syringe via the septum into the sample cell (5 ml) hanging in the quartz reactor.The reactor was kept in dark for 1 h to establish the adsorption-desorption equilibrium before the irradiation. A 300W Xe arc lamp (PLS-SXE 300C, Beijing Perfect light Co., Ltd.), emitting UV-vis light (320 nm 780 nm) with an energy output of 0.8 W cm -2 measured by a Thorlabs PM100 optical power and energy meter, was placed at a distance of approximate 5 cm from the reactor to be the irradiation source to trigger the photocatalytic reaction.The temperature of the reactor was kept at 298 K with an electronic fan.At certain irradiation time interval during the experiment, 1 ml of reactive gas was taken from the reactor with a syringe for analysis.The amounts of the products were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC 2014C) fitted with a highsensitivity thermal conductivity detector (TCD) detector for quantifying the amounts of H2 formed from H2O photoreduction and a flame ionization detector (FID) detector for quantifying the amounts of CO and CH4 formed from CO2 photoreduction.After the effluents were separated by the PN pre-column and 5A molecular sieve column, H2 and O2 were analyzed by the TCD detector.CH4 was analyzed by the FID detector.CO was further converted to CH4 by a methanation reactor and then analyzed by the FID detector.The detection limits of our analytic method for CH4 and CO were both 0.002 mol.The detection limits for H2 was 0.004 mol. Argon was used as the carrier gas.The contrast activity tests were conducted by replacing CO2 with N2 under other reaction conditions identical.",

            "paragraph_text": "Bi2WO6-TiO2 (B-T) binanosheets have been prepared through an electrostatic self-assembly between positively charged A-TNS and negatively charged BWO, based on which we have unveiled the interplay, i.e., the co-existence of a competition and an interaction between lightdriven CO2 photocatalytic reduction and carbonaceous residues decomposition, as schematically shown in Fig. 4i.Although the true activity of as-fabricated B-T for photocatalytic CO2 reduction is hard to be confirmed, some enlightenment on the future researches in the filed of gas-phase photocatalytic CO2 reduction are highlighted.Firstly, the photoactive materials is better to be synthesized avoiding introduction of large amounts of carbon containing reagents, such as surfactant or polymer, which could complicate accurate evaluation of the true photoactivity; and/or post-treatment such as UV-irradiation or thermal activation in air can be employed to remove possible residues on the condition of not destroying the structure and properties of the materials.Secondly, the contrast test of activity under inert gas instead of CO2 to exclude the contribution of carbonaceous residues to the products formation might lead to underestimation of the true activity, since CO2 molecules could play a role in suppressing the carbonaceous residues decomposition.At last, the enhanced Z-scheme charge transfer between BWO and TNS can reduce more CO released from the carbonaceous residues to CH4, and thus it is reasonable to propose that more rationally designed Z-scheme based composites without the disturbance of carbonaceous residues would be a promising material to obtain higher selectivity for CH4 formation in photocatalytic CO2 reduction. time unveil the co-existence of a competition and an interaction relationship between lightdriven carbonaceous residues decomposition and photocatalytic CO2 reduction, which further emphasizes the necessity of removing organic residues from photocatalysts and carefully analysing the origin of carbon-containing products to estimate the photocatalytic performance towards CO2 reduction in a more accurate way.Moreover, this work could provide some enlightenment on designing and/or synthesising more efficient photocatalysts for CO2 reduction with high selectivity for CH4 formation, where rational construction of Z-scheme heterostructures is highlighted.Keywords: light-driven; CO2 photoreduction; carbonaceous residues decomposition; photoluminescence spectra (PL) for powder samples were analyzed on an Edinburgh Analytical Fig. 2a depicts the XRD patterns of TNS, BWO and B-T composite.It is clear to see that all the diffraction peaks of pure TNS are ascribed to the anatase phase of TiO2 (JCPDS No. 21-1272) and those of BWO are attributed to the orthorhombic Bi2WO6 phase (JCPDS No. 73-2020 photocatalytic CO2 reduction with H2O3,12. characterizations.As shown in Fig.4f, significantly improved photocurrent values can be observed over B-T as compared to bare BWO and TNS, demonstrating the more efficient charge transfer achieved within B-T composite34.The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) Nyquist plots were measured to gain insight into the charge transfer process on the sample electrodes as well as the contact interface between electrode and electrolyte55.As displayed in Fig.4g, the Nyquist diagrams of B-T electrodes show depressed semicircle as compared to bare BWO and TNS, indicating that the introduction of BWO contributes to enhanced charge transfer.The photoluminesence (PL) spectrum of the samples conducted under 340 nm monochromatic light excitation was employed to study the recombination of electron-hole pairs.
