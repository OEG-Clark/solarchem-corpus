            "paragraph_text": "Highly dispersed Cu was incorporated into the TiO 2 lattice by using the FSP system (NPS10, Tethis, Italy) reported in our previous works 29,30.Typically, a certain amount of Cu(NO 3 ) 2 3H 2 O was dissolved into a mixed solution of titanium butoxide (TBOT) and ethanol (17 vol TBOT).Then, the mixed precursor solution was dispersed into fine droplets through a two-fluid atomizing nozzle and ignited by a pilot CH 4 /O 2 annular flame.The solid combustion products were collected by a glass fibre filter and labelled as CuTi-0.5,CuTi-1, and CuTi-2 according to the designated molar ratios of Cu/(Cu Ti) (0.5 mol, 1 mol, and 2 mol, respectively).The flow rates of precursor solution and the dispersion gas (O 2 ) were 5 mL min -1 and 5 L min -1 , respectively. For all catalysts, the crystal lattice structure and parameters were tested by an Empyrean X-ray diffractometer using Cu K radiation ( 0.1542 nm).The surface area and porosity were analysed by a Micrometrics analyser (ASAP 2020) through N 2 adsorption-desorption.The chemical states of surface elements were determined on an X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) instrument (Shimadzu/KRATOS AXIS-ULTRA DLD-600W).Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were acquired on an FEI Tecnai G 2 F30 instrument.The electron-hole recombination characteristics were obtained from photoluminescence (PL) spectra with excitation by a 325 nm laser using a LabRAM HR800c focal laser Raman microscope.The absorption of incident light was obtained from UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) collected by a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer, Lambda950). The in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectra (DRIFTS) were collected on a Nicolet iS50 spectrometer (Thermofisher).The in situ experiments were conducted in a Harrick reaction chamber with two ZnSe windows and another quartz window, which are used for IR and UV light transmission, respectively.CO 2 and water co-adsorption in the dark were first investigated by passing CO 2 and a water vapour mixture into the reaction chamber at 30 C for 15 min.Then, the Xe lamp was switched on to study the transformation of CO 2 species during the photocatalytic reaction. Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was performed at 120 C in a successive-flow reactor reported in our previous work 13,31.The light source (300-400 nm, 7.3 mW cm -2 ) was supplied by a 300 W Xe arc lamp.Typically, a thin film of catalyst (10 mg) was deposited on a glass plate put in the photoreactor.Before illumination, the reactor was first purged with a mixture of CO 2 and water vapour (4.4 vol water) for 1 h at 200 mL min -1 and then 0.5 h at 5 mL min -1 .Next, the Xe lamp was turned on and the photocatalytic experiment began.The concentrations of gaseous products were analysed every half an hour by a gas chromatography (GC) using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a flame ionization detector (FID). To verify that all carbonaceous products came from CO 2 reduction, a series of blank experiments was performed as follows: first, a mixture of CO 2 and H 2 O vapour was used as the reactants in the empty reactor or reactor with only a Petri plate in it.The results showed that, in the above two cases, no carbon-containing products were generated in the dark or under light, proving that CO 2 photoreduction failed to happen without photocatalyst.Second, N 2 was used to replace CO 2 in a CO 2 / water vapour mixture to perform the reaction in the presence of photocatalyst.No carbonaceous products were detected under light, demonstrating that all carbon-containing products originated from CO 2 .",
