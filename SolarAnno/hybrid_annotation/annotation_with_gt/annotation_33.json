            "paragraph_text": "Carbon dioxide was photocatalytically reduced to produce methanol in an aqueous solution using 254 nm UV irradiation.Titania and Cu-loaded titania were synthesized by an improved sol-gel method using a homogeneous hydrolysis technique.The grain size of TiO 2 and Cu/TiO 2 were uniform and average diameters were approximately 20 nm.Photocatalytic reduction was conducted in a quartz reactor with a UV lamp irradiating at the center.XPS analysis reveals that Cu 2p 3/2 is 933.4 eV indicating primary Cu 2 O species on the TiO 2 supports.EDX and XPS revealed that most copper clusters were on the TiO 2 surface.The optimum amount of copper loading was 2.0 wt. for the highest dispersion among catalysts.The methanol yield of 2.0 wt. Cu/TiO 2 was 118 mol/g following 6 h of UV illumination.The yield was much higher than those of sol-gel TiO 2 and Degussa P25, whose yields were 4.7 and 38.2 mol/g, respectively.The methanol yield reached a steady-state 250 mol/g after 20 h of irradiation.Experimental results indicated that the methanol yield was significantly increased by adding NaOH.The caustic solution dissolved more CO 2 than did pure water.In addition, the OH -in aqueous solution also served as a strong hole scavenger.The redistribution of the electric charge and the Schottky barrier of Cu and TiO 2 facilitates electron trapping via supported Cu.The photocatalytic efficiency of Cu/TiO 2 was markedly increased because of the lowering the re-combination probability for hole-electron pairs.The highest quantum and energy efficiencies achieved were 10 and 2.5, respectively.",

            "paragraph_text": "Catalysts were prepared via the sol-gel route illustrated in Fig. 1.The precursor was titanium(IV) butoxide (Ti(OC 4 H 9 ) 4 , 97 in n-butanol), as purchased from Aldrich (USA).The hydrolysis process was performed in a glove box maintained at a relative humidity under 25 by purging with tank nitrogen.To avoid rapid precipitation during polycondensation and the formation of unstable colloidal sols, the hydrolyzing water was homogeneously released by the esterification of butanol and acetic acid 5.The basic aim was to provide the appropriate stoichiometric quantity of water to hydrolyze titanium butoxide during hydrolysis.A typical batch contained 0.02 mol titanium butoxide, 0.08 mol anhydrous butanol (minimum 99.8) and 0.08 mol glacial acetic acid (minimum 99.7).The clear solution was stirred for 8 h at which time the pH value became stabilized.The final pH value of the solution approached 3.56.The transparent sol was dried from room temperature to 150 C in an oven, then transferred to a furnace and calcined at 500 C to burn off hydrocarbons.The sample was crushed into powder in a mortar.The JRC-2 and P25 titania powders were obtained from Fuji Titan (Japan) and Degussa (Germany), respectively, for comparison.Copper-loaded titania (Cu/TiO 2 ) and P25 (Cu/P25) were impregnated by adding CuCl 2 during the sol-gel process and incipient wetness method, respectively.Following calcination similar to that of TiO 2 , Cu-loaded titania was reduced under a flow of 5 H 2 /Ar mixture at 300 C for 3 h. The specific surface area and pore size distribution of catalysts were measured by N 2 adsorption in a Micromeritics ASAP 2000.A diffusive reflective UV-VIS spectrophotometer (Hitachi U-3410) was employed to measure the UV-VIS absorption and estimate the bandgap of the catalysts.The particle size distribution in aqueous solution was obtained using a Coulter LS230 particle size analyzer.Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (SEM-EDX, Philips XL30, EDAX DX4) were used to observe the morphology of catalysts and estimate the elemental ratio.The crystalline phase was identified by X-ray diffraction (MAC MO3XHF).The chemical status and shift of the catalyst surface were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).XPS measurements were taken on a VG Microtech MT500 spectrometer, operated with a constant pass energy of 50 eV and with Mg K radiation as the excitation source (h 1253.6eV).The catalyst was pressed into a pellet, and then adhered on sample holder by carbon tape.Oxygen (1 s, 530.7 eV for TiO 2 ) 6 and carbon (1 s, 284.5 eV) were taken as internal standards for binding energy calibration.The fluorescence spectra of catalysts were measured by a Jasco FP-777 fluorescence spectrophotometer at an excitation wavelength of 370 nm. The copper dispersion of Cu/TiO 2 was measured using the method of Chang et al. 7.The Cu/TiO 2 catalyst was reduced in a 5 H 2 /Ar stream at 300 C for 3 h.The catalyst was purged and cooled to 80 C in Ar, and the oxidation was then performed using N 2 O at that temperature.Only surface copper was selectively oxidized by N 2 O when the oxidation temperature was under less than 100 C. The decomposition of N 2 O on the Cu surface generated the chemisorbed oxygen atoms as shown in Eq. ( 2) 8.Following oxidation, the catalyst was again purged in Ar and cooled to 25 C. Hydrogen temperature programmed reduction (TPR) was performed from 25 to 400 C at 10 C/min in a 5 H 2 /Ar stream.The consumption of H 2 was measured from TPR and the dispersion of copper was calculated. Fig. 2 schematically illustrates the reactor system.The system was illuminated by an 8 W Hg lamp with a peak light intensity at 254 nm in the center of the quartz reactor.The entire system was shielded by a metal case during the reaction to prevent interference from outside light.Catalyst powder (0.15-0.6 g) was suspended in 300 ml of 0.2 N NaOH aqueous solutions for typical batches.Supercritical-fluid grade CO 2 was purchased from Air Products (USA) to avoid any hydrocarbon contamination.It was certified maximum hydrocarbons less than 20 ppb.CO 2 was bubbled through the reactor for at least 30 min to purge air and to saturate the solution.The reactor was tightly closed during the reaction, and the CO 2 pressure was maintained in the range of 101.3-135.6 kPa.A magnetic stirrer agitated the catalyst-suspended solution at the The release of O 2 during the reaction would constitute direct evidence of CO 2 photoreduction (Eq.( 1)).An oxygen sensor (Mettler Toledo InPro 6000 series) was placed in the reactor to monitor the concentration of dissolved O 2 during the photoreduction.The sensor was calibrated using the dual point mode before measuring O 2 concentration.The O 2 sensor was inserted into oxygen-free gel until the \"ready\" sign was on, to fix the zero point.Then, the sensor was put into O 2 -saturated solution, until \"ready\" and the value was attuned to a verified concentration (8.2 ppm, 25 C).A needle-type probe was inserted in the reactor to extract samples.The liquid sample (0.5 ml) was collected in a vial wrapped in aluminum foil to reduce interference from the indoor fluorescent light before analysis.After the catalyst's sedimentation, 1-10 l liquid sample was withdrawn and analyzed in a GC/FID equipped with a 3 m long Porapak Q column.Analysis results indicated that methanol was the dominant hydrocarbon.Formic acid, formaldehyde and ethanol were detected from some catalytic reactions, in amounts much less than that of methanol. An UVC probe (Oriel instrument, Goldilux model 70239) was attached on the outer wall of the quartz reactor, and the energy flux (W/cm 2 ) was indicated by a lumen meter (Oriel instrument, Goldilux model 70235) connected to the probe.The photon flux was obtained by dividing the energy flux by the energy of a photon with a wavelength of 254 nm.The energy flux was first measured for the reactor filled with water only.The energy flux was then measured for the reactor containing the catalyst and CO 2 during the reaction.The difference between those energy fluxes was the photo energy absorbed in photoreduction. Blank reactions were conducted to ensure that hydrocarbon production was due to the photoreduction of CO 2 , and to eliminate surrounding interference.One blank was UV-illuminated without the catalyst, and another was in the dark with the catalyst and CO 2 under the same experimental conditions.An additional blank test was UV-illuminated with the catalyst filling N 2 rather than CO 2 .No hydrocarbon was detected in the above three blank tests.",

The properties of catalysts a Estimated from FWHM of XRD by Scherrer equation.b Estimated from UV-VIS spectra.c From manufacturer. The element molar ratio of catalysts calculated from XPS and EDX analysis P25 are 3.27 and 3.47 eV, respectively, while those of sol-gel TiO 2 and Cu/TiO 2 are nearby 3.00 eV. The methanol yield, energy efficiency ( E ), quantum efficiency ( Q ) and turnover frequency (for Cu site) of catalysts lists the TOFs of Cu/TiO 2 catalysts for known Cu dispersion.The TOF of 0.6 wt. Cu/TiO 2 catalysts gave the highest value near 58, and TOFs decrease with increasing Cu loadings.Obviously, more Cu loading can increase methanol yield because of the amount of active sites.However, the photoactivity (TOF) of each Cu site declines with more Cu loading on TiO 2 surface.Therefore, catalysts with more than 2 wt.Cu loading cannot further increase the methanol yield due to the decreasing TOF.Furthermore, excess Cu loading can mask the TiO 2 surface, reducing the photoexciting capacity of TiO 2 .There exists an optimum amount of copper loading, around 2 wt. under the experimental conditions of this work.
