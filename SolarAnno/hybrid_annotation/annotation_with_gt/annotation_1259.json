            "paragraph_text": "The Niobium pentoxide powder (Nb 2 O 5 , 99.0) was supplied from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd.Melamine (C 3 H 6 N 6 , 99.0) and potassium hexacyanoferrate (K 3 Fe(CN) 6 , 99.0) were bought from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.DMEM medium culture, penicillin, phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), trypsin/EDTA and streptomycin were provided by Gibco (Germany).MTT (3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide), and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Munich, Germany).All the reagents mentioned above were used without further purification.Deionized water (specific resistance: 18.2 Mcm) was also used during the preparation steps, wherever needed. Nb 2 O 5 (2.65 g), melamine (1.26 g), and K 3 Fe(CN) 6 (1.9 g) were precisely mixed with a molar ratio of 1:1:1.5 and ground in a vessel for 20 min.The obtained yellowish precipitate was then poured into the aluminum crucible and placed in a muffle furnace, which its temperature was raised to 550 C with a rate of 2 C/min.The sample was kept h at this temperature and then was cooled down to room temperature with the same ramping rate.Finally, the soft black obtained powder was repeatedly washed with ethanol and distilled water to remove any unreacted remnant of the precursors. The morphology and structure of as-synthesized photocatalyst were characterized by Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM, XL30 model coupled with the EDX system), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM, FEI Tecnai G2 f20 s-twin with an acceleration voltage of 200 kV).The crystal phase of the as-prepared photocatalyst was identified by X-ray diffraction (Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer with Cu K radiation, 0.15406 nm).X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (a Shimadzu-Amics instrument with aluminum Ka radiation) was performed to estimate the as-prepared photocatalyst compositions.FT-IR spectra in the range of 4000-400 cm -1 were recorded on a Bruker Vertex 70 spectrophotometer.The Raman spectrum of the sample was recorded on Dispersive Raman microscopy with a 785 nm laser.UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded on a UV-visible spectrophotometer (Shimadzu Solidspec-3700 DUV), using BaSO 4 as the reference standard.The photocatalyst magnetization properties were measured on a TOEI VSM-5 vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) at 300 K. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) was performed on a Bruker E500 instrument at 100 K equipped with an Oxford cryostat performing under the X-band.The photocurrent analysis was performed using Biologic Potentiostat/Galvanostat (Biologic SP-240)) operated with a custom three-electrode system composed of the working electrode (1 1 cm 2 ), Pt wire (auxiliary electrode), and Ag/AgCl reference electrode. Photocatalytic degradation of Acetamiprid (AP) was conducted in a Pyrex reactor surrounded by a cooling water stream to maintain the medium temperature at 28 C. The irradiation source was a 300 W xenon lamp with a light intensity of 0.220 W cm -2 and a 420 nm cut-off filter.Typically, 20 mg of the photocatalyst was poured into 60 mL of the AP aqueous solution with an initial concentration of 50 ppm.Samples (ca.mL) were withdrawn for UV-vis analysis at regular time intervals and centrifuged for 10 min at the rate of 15,000 rpm.The target content was determined using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (GBC Cintra 40) adjusted in AP max at 245 nm. CO 2 catalytic photoreduction in the presence of H 2 O was performed in a Pyrex reactor under a 300 W xenon lamp equipped with a 420 nm cut-off filter, which provided the light intensity of 0.220 W cm -2 .The circulating water flow kept the temperature around 25 C.An online gas chromatography system witha TCD detector was connected to the photoreactor to assess the photoreaction yield and find methane and carbon monoxide percentage. U87-MG human GBM cancer cell line was supplied from the National Cell Bank of Iran (NCBI).The cellgrowth medium was DMEM fulfilled with fetal bovine serum (10), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 g/ml) and preservedin a humidified incubator with 5 CO 2 at 37 C. Penicillin was added to decrease the probability of microbial pollution in the cell culture, while FBS was used as the cancer cells' nutrient source.The cell confluence should be over 90 before any photocatalytic treatments, and it can be checked with an inverted microscope at a 10 objective magnification. A kind of cytotoxicity assays has been used to detect the effect of the photocatalyst on U87-MG cancer cells.As a reliable cytotoxicity assay, cell viability was evaluated using 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), and 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2 based on the previous method described elsewhere 35.The U87-MG cells were seeded at 7 103 cells/well in a 96 well plate in DMEM medium (containing penicillin (100 unitsml), FBS (10), and streptomycin (100 gml)) and incubated under humidity with 5 of CO 2 at 37 C for overnight.In the following, to permitcell sticking to the photocatalyst, DMEM in each well was substituted with fresh medium containing different concentrations (0.5, 1, and 2 mg/ml) of the photocatalyst and incubated for 15-90 min.Afterward, 20 L of MTT (5 mg/ml in PBS) was poured into each well, and the contents were then incubated for 4 h at 37 C.After incubation, the purple-colored formazan crystals were dissolved by adding 100 L of DMSO to each well.After 20 min, to determining IC50 values, the optical density was measured at 570 nm using an ELISA microplate reader.Cell viability was calculated as a percentage using the following equation: 100 All the tests were performed in triplicates to avoid any experimental error. The intracellular ROS generation using U87-MG cells were detected by DHE staining of Cayman ROS detection cell-based assay kit (DHE).U87-MG cells were seeded in 96-well plates and treated with (1 mg/ml) of the photocatalyst and incubated for 45 min.After this time, the cells were rinsed with 1 cold PBS and stained with DHE (5 m) in dark conditions for 30 min.Also, N-Acetylcysteine and Antimycin-A were used as negative and positive controls, respectively.Finally, the ROS level was evaluated by a fluorescence microscope (Cytation5 cell imaging multi-mode reader).The assay was performed based on the welldescribed method and in triplicates 36.",
