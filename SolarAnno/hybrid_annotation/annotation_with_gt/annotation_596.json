            "paragraph_text": "TiO 2 microsphere with tunable pore and chamber size are prepared by a simple solventhermal method and used as catalyst for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.It is found that the hollow microsphere with relative lower surface area of 73.8 m 2 g -1 exhibits increased pore size of 18.1 nm and cavity structure, leading to higher CO 2 diffusion coefficient of 5.4010 -5 cm 2 s -1 compared with the solid and yolk/shell microspheres.Therefore, the hollow microsphere possesses more accessible sites for CO 2 adsorption, which finally gives rise to the enhanced CO production rate of 10.90.7 molg -1 h -1 under simulated sunlight, which is respectively 1.6 and 1.4 times higher than that of solid and yolk/shell microspheres.Electron dynamic study further demonstrates that hollow microsphere shows the highest photocurrent density and the lowest charge recombination among three microspheres structure, which is attributed to the swift CO 2 diffusion providing fresh CO 2 molecules to rapidly scavenge the photo-generated electrons and finally leading to the excellence catalytic reduction performances.This method could be adopted as a general strategy to prepare high performance TiO 2 catalysts with desirable structural qualities for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction under nature sunlight.",

Scanning electron microscope (SEM) was performed at QUANTA 250 FEG equipped with OCTANE PRO.The samples were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD, Bruker D diffractometer) with Cu K radiation (1.5406A) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEOL, JSM-2100).X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out on a Thermo Fisher ESCALAB 250 instrument, using monochrome Al K (300.0 eV) as the excitation source.The BET surface areas were ascertained by cryogenic N 2 adsorption Micromeritics BEL sorp surface analyzer at 77 K.The samples were degassed at 353 K for 10 h under vacuum and by using the nitrogen flux.Prior to the measurements, the samples were dry on the oven to remove moisture.The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area and pore diameters were calculated from the adsorption branch of isotherms according to BJH method.Raman measurement was carried out using a Renishaw in Via Raman spectroscopy with the laser excitation was 532nm and a CCD detector.CO 2 adsorption was measured using BEL sorp carbon dioxide adsorption apparatus at 298K.UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-vis DRS) of samples were measured by using a UV-vis spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer Lambd 950 UV-vis spectrometer), in which BaSO 4 was used as the reflectance standard. Photocurrent and electrochemical impedance were implemented on a CHI 660D workstation (Shanghai Chenhua).The three-electrode cell comprises a work electrode, an Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) reference electrode and a platinum sheet counter electrode immersed in Na 2 SO 4 (0.5 M) aqueous electrolyte.A simulated AM 1.5 sunlight with an output power of 100 mW cm -2 produced by a solar simulator (Newport 69920) was utilized as the light source and a metal mask with 0.16 cm 2 window was applied to define the active area of each device.A 500 W mercury vapor lamp was used as the UV light source (390 nm). The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 was carried out in a home-made gas-closed circulation system. For each test, the catalyst films were prepared according to previous literature 41 and the loading amount of the catalyst is 10 mg on the glass substrate.Then, the film was put in the glass reaction cell with a total volume of 100 mL.Before light irradiation, the photoreactor system was thoroughly vacuum-treated to remove air and then ultra-pure CO 2 gas were passed through the water to blown mixture gaseous of CO 2 and H 2 O vapor at least 30 min to further exclude other gases.Finally, the reactor was sealed and encased on a self-contained water jacket with a circulating water bath at 25 oC. A 500 W mercury vapor lamp was used as the UV light source (390 nm).A 300 W Xe lamp with a standard AM1.5 filter was used as the simulated sunlight source.The photocatalytic reaction was typically performed at 298K by recirculating cooling water system for 3 hours.During irradiation, 2 mL gas was taken from the reactor at regular intervals (1h) and analyzed by a gas chromatography (GC-4000A, Beijing, China) equipped with both a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and flame ionization detector (FID).The produced gases were calibrated with a standard gas mixture and determined using the retention time.Furthermore, each experiment was repeated 5 times in parallel to obtain an average value.",

Therefore, the hollow MS demonstrates a high CO production rate of 10.90.7 molg -1 h -1 under simulated sunlight, which is much improved than that of yolk/shell and solid MSs.In addition, owing to its high structural integrity, the hollow MS exhibits high cycling stability for reuse, which permits its potential commercialization.
