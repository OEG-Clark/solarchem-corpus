The catalysts were prepared by the wet impregnation of the support using aqueous solution of H 2 PtCl 6 , RuCl 3 and Ni(NO 3 ) 2 .The samples were dried at 100 o C for 12 h, calcined in air for 4h and reduced in H 2 at 400 o C for 4 h. In order to determine the degree of the metallic phase dispersion hydrogen and oxygen chemisorption was measured.The method was characterized in details 2 .The measurements were carried out with the use of PEAK4 apparatus constructed in our Institute 3 . Figure 1 shows the construction of the reactor which was used in the studies.The gas gets into the reactor through a pipe and then flows between a quartz cylinder and a tube Figure 1.A scheme of using the photoreactor for the TPSR measurements with a catalytic bed.The tube diameter is 65 mm.The catalytic bed is heated to a proper temperature with the heating coil.After the contact with the catalyst, the gas is analysed.In the reactor the gas flow rate is included in the range of 0 -200 mil/min and the temperature range is 25 -500 o C. The temperature was measured by K type sensor. The linear increase in temperature with the rate from 0.01 to 10 o C/min is carried out with an electronic programmator. In this experiment 0.8 g of catalyst was used and a constant gas flow rate 30 cm 3 /min and a controlled linear temperature growth of 5 o /min were applied.The concentration of carbon dioxide was measured by CO 2 analyser with IR detector of Fuji company.The chemicals were analysed by a gas chromatograph with a detector.The type of chromatographic column was carbonex 1004 (Supelco) which measures the length of 1 m.The UV source was a PE 175B-10FM lamp with emission maximum at wavelength of 386 nm.The catalytic activity was characterized by temperature of 30 CO 2 conversion -T 30 .This temperature was used to measure the impact of UV on the catalytic activity.The bigger the change is, the more strongly UV activates the catalyst.",
