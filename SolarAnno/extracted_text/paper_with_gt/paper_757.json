    "content": "Cu-based catalysts have been widely studied for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction; however, the role of Cu species is still ambiguous because they exist in multiple forms, which can possibly interchange between themselves.In this paper, highly dispersed Cu was incorporated into a TiO 2 lattice through a flame spray pyrolysis (FSP) route, and it exhibited excellent activity and stability for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.The highest CO and CH 4 yields were obtained on CuTi-1, reaching 43.5 and 16.7 mol g -1 after 4 h of irradiation, which are 2.8 times and 8.4 times higher than those of pristine TiO 2 , respectively.After three cycles, the activity of CuTi-1 only slightly decreased.The highly dispersed Cu ions in the TiO 2 lattice were very stable, and they effectively slowed the recombination of the photoinduced charges, which was confirmed by XPS and PL analyses.Meanwhile, the Cu ions in the TiO 2 lattice promoted the adsorption and activation of CO 2 and served as the active sites for CO 2 photoreduction."

    "content": "Highly dispersed Cu was incorporated into the TiO 2 lattice by using the FSP system (NPS10, Tethis, Italy) reported in our previous works 29,30.Typically, a certain amount of Cu(NO 3 ) 2 3H 2 O was dissolved into a mixed solution of titanium butoxide (TBOT) and ethanol (17 vol TBOT).Then, the mixed precursor solution was dispersed into fine droplets through a two-fluid atomizing nozzle and ignited by a pilot CH 4 /O 2 annular flame.The solid combustion products were collected by a glass fibre filter and labelled as CuTi-0.5,CuTi-1, and CuTi-2 according to the designated molar ratios of Cu/(Cu Ti) (0.5 mol, 1 mol, and 2 mol, respectively).The flow rates of precursor solution and the dispersion gas (O 2 ) were 5 mL min -1 and 5 L min -1 , respectively. For all catalysts, the crystal lattice structure and parameters were tested by an Empyrean X-ray diffractometer using Cu K radiation ( 0.1542 nm).The surface area and porosity were analysed by a Micrometrics analyser (ASAP 2020) through N 2 adsorption-desorption.The chemical states of surface elements were determined on an X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) instrument (Shimadzu/KRATOS AXIS-ULTRA DLD-600W).Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were acquired on an FEI Tecnai G 2 F30 instrument.The electron-hole recombination characteristics were obtained from photoluminescence (PL) spectra with excitation by a 325 nm laser using a LabRAM HR800c focal laser Raman microscope.The absorption of incident light was obtained from UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) collected by a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer, Lambda950). The in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectra (DRIFTS) were collected on a Nicolet iS50 spectrometer (Thermofisher).The in situ experiments were conducted in a Harrick reaction chamber with two ZnSe windows and another quartz window, which are used for IR and UV light transmission, respectively.CO 2 and water co-adsorption in the dark were first investigated by passing CO 2 and a water vapour mixture into the reaction chamber at 30 C for 15 min.Then, the Xe lamp was switched on to study the transformation of CO 2 species during the photocatalytic reaction. Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was performed at 120 C in a successive-flow reactor reported in our previous work 13,31.The light source (300-400 nm, 7.3 mW cm -2 ) was supplied by a 300 W Xe arc lamp.Typically, a thin film of catalyst (10 mg) was deposited on a glass plate put in the photoreactor.Before illumination, the reactor was first purged with a mixture of CO 2 and water vapour (4.4 vol water) for 1 h at 200 mL min -1 and then 0.5 h at 5 mL min -1 .Next, the Xe lamp was turned on and the photocatalytic experiment began.The concentrations of gaseous products were analysed every half an hour by a gas chromatography (GC) using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a flame ionization detector (FID). To verify that all carbonaceous products came from CO 2 reduction, a series of blank experiments was performed as follows: first, a mixture of CO 2 and H 2 O vapour was used as the reactants in the empty reactor or reactor with only a Petri plate in it.The results showed that, in the above two cases, no carbon-containing products were generated in the dark or under light, proving that CO 2 photoreduction failed to happen without photocatalyst.Second, N 2 was used to replace CO 2 in a CO 2 / water vapour mixture to perform the reaction in the presence of photocatalyst.No carbonaceous products were detected under light, demonstrating that all carbon-containing products originated from CO 2 ."

    "content": "Fig. 1A shows that the TiO 2 in all samples has two phases: anatase and rutile.The intensity of the main rutile peak (2 27.44)increased gradually as the copper doping ratio increases, indicating the promotion of the transformation of anatase to rutile by Cu doping.With the increase of the copper doping ratio, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the main peak is nearly constant, indicating less variation in the particle size of the as-synthesized samples.No peaks corresponding to CuO or Cu 2 O were detected in all CuTi samples, which means that no large CuO or Cu 2 O crystals were formed in CuTi catalysts.This is because, in the FSP process, the composites can be mixed at an atomic level, which inhibits the formation of large Cu oxide crystals 32,33.In our previous work 30, no Cu oxide crystals were detected in FSPmade Cu/TiO 2 particles even when the Cu content reached 20 wt.Notably, as shown in Fig. 1B, the main peak of CuTi samples moved to a lower diffraction angle, indicating the expansion of the TiO 2 cell volume.Considering the larger radii of Cu (96 pm) and Cu 2 (72 pm) than that of Ti 4 (68 pm), this result basically proved the possible substitution of Ti 4 in TiO 2 by Cu ions.13,28,34. Fig. 2 shows the TEM images of all samples with their particle distributions, indicating that TiO 2 particles are basically spherical nanoparticles with an average size of approximately 10 nm.The co-existence of anatase and rutile TiO 2 phases was observed based on the interplanar spacing in HR-TEM images, which is consistent with the XRD results.However, no Cu 2 O or CuO crystals were clearly observed in the TEM and HR-TEM images of CuTi samples.In our previous work 30, we found that even when the Cu concentration reached 12, it is still difficult to clearly observe the Cu oxide crystals in the TEM images of FSP-synthesized Cu/TiO 2 .EELS mapping (Fig. 2E-H) shows the distributions of Cu, Ti, and O elements in the CuTi-1 sample.Fig. 4H shows that Cu was highly dispersed in the CuTi-1 sample.Therefore, combining the results of XRD, it can be known that the Cu species were highly dispersed and could exist as dopants incorporated into the TiO 2 lattice rather than as Cu 2 O/CuO crystals deposited on the surface of TiO 2 . The XPS spectra in Fig. 3A show that the Cu 2p 3/2 peaks for CuTi-0.5 and CuTi-1 were both located at approximately 932.5 eV, demonstrating that the Cu in CuTi-0.5 and CuTi-1 existed as Cu(I) 22,35.Merely, the Cu 2p 3/2 peak of CuTi-2 can be fitted into two peaks located ca. 932.5 eV and 934.4 eV, respectively.The former is assigned to Cu(I), while the latter is attributed to Cu(II).This indicates that the Cu(II) precursors cannot be completely reduced to Cu(I) during the flame spray pyrolysis process if the concentration of Cu dopant is too high.Combining the results of XRD and TEM, it can be concluded that the Cu and Cu 2 were incorporated into the TiO 2 lattice.Fig. 3B shows that the Ti 2p 3/2 peaks were located at approximately 458.6 eV for all the samples, showing that the Ti in all the samples existed as Ti 4 36,37.Fig. 3C shows that the O 1s XPS spectra of the CuTi samples can be resolved into two peaks at 529.9 and 531.6 eV, which were attributed to the lattice oxygen in TiO 2 (O L ) and hydroxyl species (O H ), respectively 17. Table 1 shows that appropriate Cu doping increased the specific surface area of TiO 2 , which may be due to the inhibition of the agglomeration of TiO 2 particles by Cu doping, as evident in the TEM images in Fig. 2.However, an excess doping concentration of Cu ( 1) decreased the specific surface area.This phenomenon was also observed in our previous work, which can be attributed to the increased crystallite size of TiO 2 in the presence of a high doping amount of Cu 30. Fig. 4 shows the UV-vis DRS of the CuTi catalysts.Compared to TiO 2 , the absorption edge of CuTi samples presented a slight redshift, which indicated that the Cu doping enhanced the visible light absorption of TiO 2 .Table 1 summarizes the band gaps of CuTi photocatalysts, which decreased with the increase of the Cu concentration.This may be because Cu doping promoted the phase transformation of TiO 2 from anatase to rutile (as shown in Fig. 1 and Table 1), and the latter has a smaller band gap. The PL spectra in Fig. 5 show that all the samples have two peaks located at approximately 430 and 520 nm, which can be attributed to the band edge free excitons and bound excitons, respectively 13.For pristine TiO 2 , the intensity of the PL peak at 520 nm is weaker than that at 430 nm; however, for CuTi samples, the intensity of the PL peak at 520 nm is stronger.This indicated that more photoinduced electrons were captured on CuTi samples.In addition, the PL intensity remarkably decreased with the increase of the Cu content from 0 to 1, which demonstrated that Cu dopants can work as photogenerated electron acceptors and promote the separation of photoexcited charges 9,10.A similar phenomena was reported by Park et al. 38.However, the PL intensity increased when the Cu content increased to 2.This is because excess Cu ions may act as recombination centres for photogenerated electron and hole pairs.It should be noted that in Table 1, the ratio of rutile in CuTi samples increased from TiO 2 to CuTi-2, while the PL intensity decreased first and then increased, which means that the formation of a heterophase junction did not dominate the separation of photogenerated charges. The CO and CH 4 yields of CuTi samples are shown in Fig. 6 and Table 2.The main products were detected to be CO and CH 4 , while no H 2 existed, which demonstrated that Cu doping prefers the reduction of CO 2 rather than water.The productions of CO and CH 4 of CuTi catalysts were both higher than those of pristine TiO 2 .The yields increased as the Cu doping content (0 to 1) increased.The highest yields of CO (43.5 mol g -1 ) and CH 4 (16.7 mol g -1 ) were obtained by the CuTi-1 sample after 4 h of irradiation, which were much higher than those reported in the literature 9,20,35.The production of CO and CH 4 decreased when the Cu doping CO content increased to 2.This may be caused by the excess doping of Cu, which can work act recombination centres of photogenerated charges, as evident in the PL analysis. Table 2 shows the quantum efficiencies of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction on CuTi catalysts 39.For CuTi-1, the quantum efficiencies for CH 4 and CO were 0.0566 and 0.0872, respectively.Apparently, the quantum efficiencies of the CuTi catalyst were higher than those of TiO 2 , showing a higher photon utilization rate of CuTi catalysts. The cycle performance of CO 2 photoreduction on CuTi-1 is shown in Fig. 7.After each cycle, the reactor was purged with a mixture of CO 2 / water vapour, and the same photocatalytic reaction process was restarted.The results show that compared to the first cycle, the performance of CuTi-1 catalysts in the second and third cycles remained nearly unchanged, demonstrating the good stability of CuTi-1 catalyst.To further elucidate this, the chemical states of Cu in CuTi-1 before and after cycles were analysed (Fig. 8).The results show that the chemical states of Cu species before and after cycles did not change, demonstrating that Cu ions in CuTi-1 were stable during CO 2 photoreduction.In our previous work 23, we found that the Cu 2 O deposited on the surface of TiO 2 would be reduced to Cu 0 after photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.Similar phenomena were also observed in TiO 2 deposited by Cu(I) species reported in the literature 24,26, implying that Cu doped in the TiO 2 lattice is more stable than that deposited on the surface of TiO 2 .This not only explains the stable photocatalytic performance of the CuTi-1 catalyst well but also implies that FSP is an excellent route to prepare stable Cu ion-doped TiO 2 catalyst.) at 1301 cm -1 41.For CuTi samples, more new peaks Combining characterization and in situ DRIFT analysis, it can be concluded that the enhanced and stable activity of CuTi catalysts were ascribed to the highly dispersed and stable Cu ions in the TiO 2 lattice, which increased the surface area, facilitated the separation of photoexcited charges, and promoted the adsorption and activation of CO 2 ."
