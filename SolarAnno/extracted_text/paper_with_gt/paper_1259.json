    "content": "A new magnetic quaternary photocatalyst, K 4 Nb 6 O 17 /-Fe 2 O 3 /Fe 3 N/g-C 3 N 4 , was synthesized via a simple onestep thermal pyrolysis process.The prepared photocatalyst was well characterized, and its photocatalytic activity was evaluated towards acetamiprid pesticide degradation, CO 2 reduction reaction, and U87-MG cell eradication.The coexistence of four different crystalline structures in the prepared photocatalyst could simultaneously facilitate photoelectron transport and suppress charge recombination through their coupled heterogeneous interfaces.Because of the coexistence of various photosensitive compounds, the prepared photocatalyst showed the excellent capability to harvest the visible light photons despite its calculated high-bandgap of 2.75 eV.Besides, the magnetic saturation of about 12 emu/g facilitated the photocatalyst reusability.Benefiting from these favorable properties, the quaternary photocatalyst exhibited 76 removal efficiency for the degradation of acetamiprid pesticide after five times repeated cycles.The evolution rate of 7.01 and 1.3 mol g -1 h -1 was estimated for CO and CH 4, respectively.According to the morphological properties of the treated cells with the IC50 concentration, adecrease of about 50 of viability was observed.Ultimately, the mechanism of charge transfer was comprehensively discussed by quenching experiments and spin-trapping ESR."

    "content": "The Niobium pentoxide powder (Nb 2 O 5 , 99.0) was supplied from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd.Melamine (C 3 H 6 N 6 , 99.0) and potassium hexacyanoferrate (K 3 Fe(CN) 6 , 99.0) were bought from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.DMEM medium culture, penicillin, phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), trypsin/EDTA and streptomycin were provided by Gibco (Germany).MTT (3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide), and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Munich, Germany).All the reagents mentioned above were used without further purification.Deionized water (specific resistance: 18.2 Mcm) was also used during the preparation steps, wherever needed. Nb 2 O 5 (2.65 g), melamine (1.26 g), and K 3 Fe(CN) 6 (1.9 g) were precisely mixed with a molar ratio of 1:1:1.5 and ground in a vessel for 20 min.The obtained yellowish precipitate was then poured into the aluminum crucible and placed in a muffle furnace, which its temperature was raised to 550 C with a rate of 2 C/min.The sample was kept h at this temperature and then was cooled down to room temperature with the same ramping rate.Finally, the soft black obtained powder was repeatedly washed with ethanol and distilled water to remove any unreacted remnant of the precursors. The morphology and structure of as-synthesized photocatalyst were characterized by Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM, XL30 model coupled with the EDX system), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM, FEI Tecnai G2 f20 s-twin with an acceleration voltage of 200 kV).The crystal phase of the as-prepared photocatalyst was identified by X-ray diffraction (Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer with Cu K radiation, 0.15406 nm).X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (a Shimadzu-Amics instrument with aluminum Ka radiation) was performed to estimate the as-prepared photocatalyst compositions.FT-IR spectra in the range of 4000-400 cm -1 were recorded on a Bruker Vertex 70 spectrophotometer.The Raman spectrum of the sample was recorded on Dispersive Raman microscopy with a 785 nm laser.UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded on a UV-visible spectrophotometer (Shimadzu Solidspec-3700 DUV), using BaSO 4 as the reference standard.The photocatalyst magnetization properties were measured on a TOEI VSM-5 vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) at 300 K. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) was performed on a Bruker E500 instrument at 100 K equipped with an Oxford cryostat performing under the X-band.The photocurrent analysis was performed using Biologic Potentiostat/Galvanostat (Biologic SP-240)) operated with a custom three-electrode system composed of the working electrode (1 1 cm 2 ), Pt wire (auxiliary electrode), and Ag/AgCl reference electrode. Photocatalytic degradation of Acetamiprid (AP) was conducted in a Pyrex reactor surrounded by a cooling water stream to maintain the medium temperature at 28 C. The irradiation source was a 300 W xenon lamp with a light intensity of 0.220 W cm -2 and a 420 nm cut-off filter.Typically, 20 mg of the photocatalyst was poured into 60 mL of the AP aqueous solution with an initial concentration of 50 ppm.Samples (ca.mL) were withdrawn for UV-vis analysis at regular time intervals and centrifuged for 10 min at the rate of 15,000 rpm.The target content was determined using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (GBC Cintra 40) adjusted in AP max at 245 nm. CO 2 catalytic photoreduction in the presence of H 2 O was performed in a Pyrex reactor under a 300 W xenon lamp equipped with a 420 nm cut-off filter, which provided the light intensity of 0.220 W cm -2 .The circulating water flow kept the temperature around 25 C.An online gas chromatography system witha TCD detector was connected to the photoreactor to assess the photoreaction yield and find methane and carbon monoxide percentage. U87-MG human GBM cancer cell line was supplied from the National Cell Bank of Iran (NCBI).The cellgrowth medium was DMEM fulfilled with fetal bovine serum (10), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 g/ml) and preservedin a humidified incubator with 5 CO 2 at 37 C. Penicillin was added to decrease the probability of microbial pollution in the cell culture, while FBS was used as the cancer cells' nutrient source.The cell confluence should be over 90 before any photocatalytic treatments, and it can be checked with an inverted microscope at a 10 objective magnification. A kind of cytotoxicity assays has been used to detect the effect of the photocatalyst on U87-MG cancer cells.As a reliable cytotoxicity assay, cell viability was evaluated using 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), and 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2 based on the previous method described elsewhere 35.The U87-MG cells were seeded at 7 103 cells/well in a 96 well plate in DMEM medium (containing penicillin (100 unitsml), FBS (10), and streptomycin (100 gml)) and incubated under humidity with 5 of CO 2 at 37 C for overnight.In the following, to permitcell sticking to the photocatalyst, DMEM in each well was substituted with fresh medium containing different concentrations (0.5, 1, and 2 mg/ml) of the photocatalyst and incubated for 15-90 min.Afterward, 20 L of MTT (5 mg/ml in PBS) was poured into each well, and the contents were then incubated for 4 h at 37 C.After incubation, the purple-colored formazan crystals were dissolved by adding 100 L of DMSO to each well.After 20 min, to determining IC50 values, the optical density was measured at 570 nm using an ELISA microplate reader.Cell viability was calculated as a percentage using the following equation: 100 All the tests were performed in triplicates to avoid any experimental error. The intracellular ROS generation using U87-MG cells were detected by DHE staining of Cayman ROS detection cell-based assay kit (DHE).U87-MG cells were seeded in 96-well plates and treated with (1 mg/ml) of the photocatalyst and incubated for 45 min.After this time, the cells were rinsed with 1 cold PBS and stained with DHE (5 m) in dark conditions for 30 min.Also, N-Acetylcysteine and Antimycin-A were used as negative and positive controls, respectively.Finally, the ROS level was evaluated by a fluorescence microscope (Cytation5 cell imaging multi-mode reader).The assay was performed based on the welldescribed method and in triplicates 36."

    "content": "Investigation of the quaternary photocatalyst morphology analysis was performed using SEM, EDX, and TEM analysis.The SEM graphs of the photocatalyst with different resolutions from 300 nm to 1 m shown in Fig. 1a demonstrated that the photocatalyst has a nanoflake structure with a diameter of a few hundred nm.Fig. 1b exhibited the EDS mapping of Nedodium, Carbon, Oxygen, Nitrogen, Iron, and potassium, consistent with the other analysis results.The TEM images with different magnifications from 100 nm to 500 nm have been demonstrated in Fig. 1c.The coexistence of different phases with layered flake structure in the heterogeneous photocatalyst was confirmed with the white, gray, and black areasin the TEM images with different resolutions.TEM images in lower magnifications (100 nm and 200 nm) demonstrated that the main morphology of prepared photocatalystis sheet-like, in which the main components construct a multiple-phase system containing nano-sized particles on irregular micro sheets. 33,43.The sharp and intense peaks observed at 851 and 877 cm -1 are attributed to the stretching mode of the Nb-O linkages.The bands at 571 and 637 cm -1 and the others in the region between 700 and 500 cm -1 are ascribed to the Nb-O stretching mode of the slightly distorted octahedral structure.The evident band at 400 cm -1 is also related to the Nb-O-Nb bending modes 30,44.The peaks at 479 and 544 and 988 cm -1 are attributed to C 3 N 4, which peaks at 479 and 544 cm -1 are due to the C-N stretching modes of the heterocycles 45.The sharp band at 988 cm -1 represents the breathing one mode of the triazine ring 46.The peak appearing at 220 cm -1 is related to Raman active A 1g mode of Fe 2 O 3 involved in the iron cation movement along the crystallographic c-axis.In comparison, the peaks at 417 and 644 cm -1 are related to the Raman active E g mode of Fe 2 O 3 arising fromthe symmetric breathing mode of O-Fe cations linkages in the plane perpendicular to the c-axis 47.XPS, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, was served to explore the chemical states and surface composition of the quaternary photocatalyst (Fig. 3a).Two typical Nb 3d 5/2 and Nb 3d 3/2 peaks centered at 204.5 eV and 207.2 eV, respectively, are assigned to the Nb 5 -O bond of the K 4 Nb 6 O 17 phase (Fig. 3b).Comparing K 4 Nb 6 O 17 binding energies with pure Nb spectra (205.5 and 202.3 eV), we found that Nb 3d 3/2 and Nb3d 5/2 peaks are moved to the higher binding energy due to theNb -O bonding, implying electrons transfer from Nb to O 30.Fig. 3c exhibits the XPS spectra of O1s.The O1s peaks with the binding energies located at 527.2, 530.5, and 531.5 eV can be assigned to the lattice oxygen, oxygen vacancies, and hydroxyl oxygen, respectively.Deconvolution of the extendable Fe 2p spectrum of Fe 3 N and Fe 2 O 3 , Fig. 3d, gave five components including the first spin-orbit doublet at 708.5 and 722.0 eV assigned to the 2p 3/2 -2p 1/2 of Fe 2 , the second spin-orbit doublet at 710.5 and 728.5 eV corresponded to the 2p 3/2 -2p 1/2 of Fe 3 , and the peak at 715.2 eV which is known as the satellite peak 48.In the C1s core-level XPS spectrum displayed in Fig. 3e, four peaks at 282.5, 286.2, 293.0, and 295.8 eV can be observed.The peak ascribed to the C--C in adventitious carbon of g-C 3 N 4 appears at 284.8 eV 49.The peak at 286.2 eV was assigned to sp 2 -bonded carbon atoms in the heterocycle (N-C--N) of the aromatic g-C 3 N 4 49.Also, two peaks at 293.0 and 295.8 eV are attributed to K 2p of K 50.As can be seen in Fig. 3f, there are three different bonding states for the doped nitrogen atoms, which appeared at 398.3, 400.1, and 401.1 eV, corresponding to pyridinic, pyrrolic, and graphitic N, respectively 51.It should be mentioned that a slight peak shift has been observed in all XPS peak positions compared to the literature. The Magnetic properties of K 4 Nb 6 O 17 /-Fe 2 O 3 /Fe 3 N/g-C 3 N 4 were explored by VSM analysis at room temperature.The hysteresis curve obtained by the characterization is shown in Fig. 4a.The results revealed that the prepared photocatalyst has a magnetic saturation of about emu/g at 9938.63 Oe, which could be due to the Fe 3 N and/or iron oxide hematite phase in the structure 52.In the Fourier transform infrared spectra (Fig. 4b), the bands above 750 cm -1 are attributed to the stretching modes of short niobium-oxygen bonds in the layered pattern of the structure.In contrast, the potassium atoms contribute to the bands observed below 180 cm -1 53.The peaks at 812, 1542, and 3394 cm - have corresponded to the triazine ring bending, C-N, -CN-, C--N stretching, and N -H (of the secondary amine) stretching, respectively 54,55.Fig. 4c demonstrates the plot of (hv) 2 versus the energy of the absorbed light for the as-obtained quaternary photocatalyst.As it can be observed, the determined bandgap is 2.75 eV.Although the coexistence of different materials phases in prepared photocatalyst does not lead to the creation of a lower bandgap however it provides a high amount of vacancies, especially oxygen vacancies in the structure, which can trap the photogenerated electrons and adsorb O 2 molecules which could be reduced into O 2 -.The oxygen-vacancy-involved photocatalytic reactions can be described by equations 56.The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) technique is used to detect the existence of paramagnetic centers in K 4 Nb 6 O 17 /-Fe 2 O 3 /Fe 3 N/C 3 N 4 photocatalyst, as shown in Fig. 4d.The EPR measurement demonstrates a strong signal at g of 2.0035, which could be related to the electrons trapped on oxygen vacancies in the K 4 Nb 6 O 17 structure or unpaired electrons on the carbon atoms of the aromatic rings within p-bonded of g-C 3 N 4 57. max was drastically decreased after 3 h of the treatment time, implying a significant degradation of AP at ambient conditions.For the comparison, AP degradation was carried out in the presence of pristine g-C 3 N 4 .According to the results of Fig. 5b, linear behavior of Ln(C 0 /C) vs. time demonstrated that the photoreaction obeyed pseudo-first-order kinetics model, where the slope would be rate constant.Accordingly, the rate constants were determined to be 0.01 and 0.005 min -1 for the quaternary photocatalyst and pristine g-C 3 N 4 , respectively, highlighted more efficient and faster AP photodegradation over the quaternary photocatalyst.The removal efficiency assessment of the PA indicated that the quaternary photocatalyst has excellent structural stability since no significant changes were observed in the XRD pattern of the prepared photocatalyst after several cycles (Fig. 5c), which confirmed that the crystalline phase of the photocatalyst is stable enough to not undergo any changes after a few cycles.Furthermore, after magnetic separation of photocatalyst, the reusability test shows only a slight decrease after five consecutive runs, as demonstrated in Fig. 5d.The charming magnetic and electronic properties of Fe 3 N play a vital role in photocatalyst reusability and enhances the charge carriers' lifetime through interfacial heterojunction simultaneously.The photodegradation experiments were performed in the presence and absence of the light source to evaluate the contribution of the photocatalyst sorption capacity and light source in AP removal under the same operational conditions.According to the obtained results in Fig. 5e, less than 1 of reduction is due to the contribution of the photocatalyst sorption and light source, implying that the whole removal can be attributed to the Due to the charge-transport property of each components, the quaternary photocatalyst exhibits considerably increased constant photocurrent compared to pure g-C 3 N 4 58. Radical quenching experiments were performed to indicate the most probable radical species contributing to the AP photocatalytic degradation.Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), benzoquinone (BQ), and tert-butyl alcohol (TBA) were used as hole (h ) scavenger, superoxide ( O 2 ) scavenger, and hydroxyl radical ( OH) scavengers, respectively.According to the obtained results in Fig. 6a, the AP removal efficiency in the presence of 0.1 mM scavengers TBA, EDTA, and BQ reached 27.5, 42.35, and 64.09, respectively, indicating that the hydroxyl radicals and the photogenerated holes play a crucial role in the AP photocatalytic degradation.While the contribution of superoxide ions in the reaction mechanism is not as noticeable as two other types of photogenerated species. The results of quenching experiments were further confirmed using ESR spin-trapping technique.The results of spin trapping EPR Based on the obtained experimental results and works of literature review, the following mechanism was suggested for the photoreaction in which QTP stands for the quaternary photocatalyst, K 4 Nb 6 O 17 /-Fe 2 O 3 / Fe 3 N/C 3 N 4 : The absorption of photons with suitable energy via the surface of the suspended photocatalyst particles generates the electron-hole pairs.The positively-charged holes can oxidize water and hydroxyl ions tohydroxyl radicals.The photoinduced electrons can react with molecular oxygen under acidic conditions and produce H 2 O 2, which can be further converted to OH radicals.Eventually, AP molecules would be degraded by the generated radicals 59. The conduction band, CB, and valence band, VB, edges potentials of g-C 3 N 4 are -1.30and 1.40 eV, respectively (all potentials mentioned in this section are vs.NHE), while their positions for -Fe 2 O 3 are 0.34 and 2.55 eV, respectively 40,60,61.As for K 4 Nb 6 O 17 , the CB position is -0.04 eV, and the VB position is 3.06 eV 62.According to the experimental results and the potentials, as mentioned earlier, the photogenerated charge carriers in such a system can be transferred via the Sscheme mechanism and/or double charge transfer mechanism (Fig. 7).If the quaternary structure obeys the later mechanism (Fig. 7a), the holes accumulate in the VB of g-C 3 N 4 while the electrons in the CB of g-C 3 N 4 are transferred to that of Fe 2 O 3 .Due to the more positive potentials of OH/H 2 O, 2.54 eV, and OH/OH -, 2.38 eV, 61,63 compared to that of g-C 3 N 4 , the photogenerated h on g-C 3 N 4 do does not have enough strength to produce hydroxyl radicals, which support the outcomes of neither quenching experiments nor spin-trapping ESR.The same trend is expected for Fe , as well as commercial P25, and g-C 3 N 4 , as photocatalytic references, are shown in Fig. 8.The experiments were performed in the presence of water molecules at room temperature.According to the obtained results in Fig. 8, the production rates of 7.01 and 1.3 mol g -1 h -1 were achieved for CO and CH 4 , respectively, over the quaternary photocatalyst under visible light, which is almost 14.6 higher than that of g-C 3 N 4 .Although P25 showed a desirable capacity for CO 2 to CO reduction; however, it didn't result in CH 4 production, which might be due to the high electron-hole recombination rate.Methane, although, was detected over g-C 3 N 4 after 4.5 h of the reaction time, the evolution rate of 0.48 mol g -1 h -1 for CO was much less than P25 under the same condition.The photogenerated charge carriers are efficiently transferred between the interfacial heterojunctions in K 4 Nb 6 O 17 /-Fe 2 O 3 /Fe 3 N/g-C 3 N 4, leading to improve photoreduction performance.Furthermore, the coexistence of a large number of active sites on the surface corresponding to four crystalline phases can efficiently support each other to promote the photoreduction process.All the above statements confirmed that the prepared quaternary photocatalyst could be a favorable candidate for the environmental crisis issues and energy saving. The following mechanism has been suggested for the photoreduction of CO 2 over the K 4 Nb 6 O 17 /-Fe 2 O 3 /Fe 3 N/g-C 3 N 4 (QTP).The photogenerated electron-hole pairs on the surface of the QTP reacted with water and adsorbed CO 2 to promote the reduction reaction via Eqs.( 8)- (11).Subsequent reactions of the carboxylate species on the surface of QTP with hydronium ions and photogenerated electrons in the CB of g-C 3 N 4 produce CO (Eqs ( 12) and ( 13)).The produced CO molecules on the surface of the QTP can further react via Eqs ( 14)-( 16) to generate methane on the surface, which are then released into the reaction vessel and analyzed by the GC detector. The anticancer efficacy of the photocatalyst has been evaluated using cell viability assay and cell morphology on both untreated cells, as control, and treated U87-MG cells under visible light and darkness (Fig. 9).The cell viability data collected at four different times in the concentration range of 0.5-2 mg/ml were demonstrated in Fig. 9a.Statistical analysis was carried out using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA).The obtained results implied that no significant change was observed in the cell viability of the treated cells compared to untreated control in darkness. On the other hand, the cell viability level was inversely changed with the photocatalyst concentration under visible light.Therefore, the photocatalyst possesses sufficient efficacy towards photocatalytic eradication of U87-MG cells under visible light rather than darkness.To determined IC50, according to obtained results, the concentration of 1 mg/ml of photocatalyst at the time of 45 min was selected for the next assays.The morphological state of untreated and treated cells with the IC50 concentration shown in Fig. 9b and illustrate the decrease of about 50 percent of cells as well as the quantity amount of control and treated cells under the concentration of 1 mg/ml of photocatalyst at the time of 45 min. The photocatalyst probably induces cell cycle arrest in GBM cancer cells via reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation.To prove that, the ROS level was determined usingthe DHE stain.The DHE stain penetrated the cells causes the appearance of green fluorescence due to the intracellular ROS generation.Cells were treated with 1 mg/ml of the photocatalyst for 45 min, stained with DHE, and the green fluorescence of treated cells compared to the untreated control was analyzed using ROS Assay Kit in the U87-MG cell line.The obtained results were demonstrated in Fig. 10(b-e) and statistically analyzed using ANOVA Fig. 10 (a).As it was shown in Fig. 10b, low light emission of green fluorescence was observedfor control cells.In contrast, an intense green fluorescence was noticed for the treated cells with 1 mg/ml of photocatalyst under visible light (Fig. 10e). Based on this experimental result, the photocatalytic eradication of the cancer cells can be due to the generation of free radical agents and ROS.Therefore, the possible mechanistic impact refers to ROS, which is the inducer of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis cell death 67,68.Although to determine the precise kind of cell death, some supplementary assays need to be done."

    "content": "The new magnetic K 4 Nb 6 O 17 /-Fe 2 O 3 /Fe 3 N/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst was fabricated by a simple one-step thermal pyrolysis method.The results obtained from different characterization techniques confirmed the successful formation of quaternary crystalline phases.According to DRS and VSM, the optical bandgap and magnetic saturation were evaluated to be 2.75 eV and 12 emu/g, respectively, which implied that the reusable quaternary photocatalyst was able to harvest the visible light photons quickly.The recycling experiments indicated that K 4 Nb 6 O 17 / -Fe 2 O 3 /Fe 3 N/g-C 3 N 4 removed 76 of acetamiprid after five consecutive runs.The charge carriers transfer in the junctions was investigated through the quenching experiments and spin-trapping EPR analysis.The obtained results from the quenching experiments and spin-trapping EPR analysis demonstrated that OH radicals are the most efficient photoactive agents for promoting the AP photodegradation.The evolution rates of 7.01 and 1.3 mol g -1 h -1 over K 4 Nb 6 O 17 /-Fe 2 O 3 /Fe 3 N/g-C 3 N 4 under irradiation were achieved for CO and CH 4 respectively, nearly 14.6 higher than that of over g-C 3 N 4 .The anti-proliferative effect of the photocatalyst was evaluated in human GBM cancer cells at different times and concentrations.The obtained results confirmed that the photocatalyst had sufficient efficacy to eradicate U87-MG cells under visible light.Overall, the obtained results implied that the prepared quaternary photocatalyst could be favorable for wastewater remediation and energy production processes.
