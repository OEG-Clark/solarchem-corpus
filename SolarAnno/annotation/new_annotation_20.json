            "paragraph_text": "The procedure for preparing the precursors of GQDs follows the method proposed by Bao et al. 17 and elucidated in our previous work 18.This procedure includes the preparation of graphene oxide (GO) through a pressurized oxidation method using reduced graphene oxide (rGO) as a precursor and further reducing GO to rGO by ammonia and hydrazine.Typically, 0.05 g of rGO, 6.7 mL HNO 3 (65, v/v), and 20 mL H 2 SO 4 (98, v/v) were mixed and refluxed at 120 C for 24 h.The above solution was then cooled down, and neutralized with Na 2 CO 3 to pH 7-8.Supernatant liquids were further collected by centrifuging, followed by dialysis through a dialysis bag (USA Viskase Membra-Cel: MD44-3.5 500, MWCO: 3500), to obtain purified GQDs solution.Average size of GQDs was controlled by varying the reflux temperature (100-125 C) and the initial concentration of rGO solution. GQDs/BWO was prepared by a microwave-hydrothermal method.Typically, 0.165 g of Na 2 WO 4 .2H 2 O and GQDs in various ratios (the typical loading amount of GQDs was 3 wt of BWO) were dissolved in DI water, followed by sonication for 30 min 0.026 g of cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) used as a template were added with 0.485 g of Bi(NO 3 ) 3 .5H 2 O into the above solution under stirring to form the precursor solution.The solution was then poured into a Teflon vessel of a microwave reactor (StartSYNTH Microwave Synthesis Labstation, Milestone, Italy), followed by sealing the vessel with a Teflon cap.The microwave reactor was operated at 120-160 C for 1.5-3 h.After the reaction, the precipitates were centrifuged and washed three times with DI water and ethanol to remove residual CTAB before drying in a vacuum chamber at 50 C for 12 h.The resultant material was denoted as GQDs/BWO.Pure Bi 2 WO 6 was prepared according to the above microwaveassisted hydrothermal procedure except no addition of GQDs. The preparation of GQDs/BWO 6-x followed an alkali etching method 19, as shown in Fig. 1a.Typically, a certain amount of GQDs/BWO was added into a beaker with 0.1 M NaOH, followed by stirring for a certain period of time (1-2 h) at 60 C.The etched solids were then washed with DI water for four times, before drying for 4 h at 25 C.The resultant powders were denoted as GQDs/BWO 6-x .Vo-contained BWO (BWO 6-x ) was synthesized according to the same method, except that BWO was used as the starting material instead of GQDs/BWO. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern was obtained in the 2 range 5-90 using a Rigaku D/MAX-3C instrument with CuK source ( 0.1541 nm).Morphology and crystal face information were obtained by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2100F, 200 kV accelerating voltage) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi JSM-636, 1-30 kV accelerating voltage).Surface electronic states were analyzed by XPS (Escalab 250XI, ThermoFisher).All binding energies were calibrated by using the contaminant carbon (C 1 s 284.7 eV) as a reference.Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were measured on a Tensor 27 FTIR spectrometer (Bruker).Diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were obtained using a Shimadzu UV-2550 UV-vis-NIR (ultraviolet-visible-near-infrared) spectrophotometer.BaSO 4 was used as the standard reflectance material.The bandgap (E g ) of photocatalysts was estimated according to the equation of hA(h-E g ) n/2 20.In this equation, h is the energy of photons, A is a proportional constant, and is the coefficient of light absorption.n is correlated to the type of semiconductors, which is 4 for an indirect semiconductor and 1 for a direct semiconductor 19.Because Bi 2 WO 6 is a direct semiconductor, the value of 1 was adopted for n in the present instance.Eg of pristine Bi 2 WO 6 and GQDs/BWO composite were identified by plotting the correlated values of (h-Eg) n/2 vs. hv, and finding the intercepts of the tangents to the plots.Surface photovoltage spectroscopy (SPS) (CEL-SPS1000, Education Au-Light, China) was applied to photoelectric property measurements.Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded by a LS55 spectrofluorometer.Transient photocurrent responses (i-t) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were measured in a quartz cell with a conventional three-electrode system on an electrochemical workstation (Princeton, V3, US). UV absorbance spectrum of liquid material was recorded on a METASH UV-6100 spectrophotometer.Infrared absorption spectra of solid samples were recorded on a NICOLET 380 FT-IR spectrophotometer using the KBr disk method.Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements were performed at liquid nitrogen temperature (77 K) on an EPR spectrometer (Bruker E580). In situ Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were measured in N 2 and CO 2 by a MCT detector (Nicolet iS10).Humid CO 2 was injected into the IR chamber to simulate the actual experimental procedure for bubbling CO 2 into the solution with a sacrificial agent.Photoluminescence spectra decay curves were obtained by using a Hamamatsu instrument (Hamamatsu C5680, Japan), and the corresponding parameters can refer to Wang's work 21. Photocatalytic activities were studied in a 200 mL Labsolar-III reactor (PerfectLight Company, Beijing, China) with an optical quartz window at the top.A 300 W of Xenon-arc lamp with a 420 nm filter (PLS-SXE300C, Beijing Perfectlight Co. Ltd, China) was positioned 10 cm above the reactor.In a typical process, 100 mg of the photocatalyst were suspended into a glass reactor containing a mixture of 90 mL of DI water and 10 mL triethanolamine (TEA, a sacrificial agent).Temperature of the reactor was controlled at 0 C by a circulating water-cooling system.Before illumination, the reaction system was first vacuated and then slowly pumped with high purity CO 2 (99.99) until the pressure became steady at 0 MPa.The above operation was repeated three times to exhaust air from the reaction system thoroughly.After stirring for 30 min, the adsorption-desorption balance between the photocatalyst and CO 2 could be established, and the Xe lamp was then turned on to start the photocatalytic experiment.Gasphase products were sampled from the glass chamber at given time intervals (1 h) for quantitative analyses of CO and other carbon-based products by an on-line gas chromatograph (GC-7806). Isotope labeling experiments were carried out according to the procedures used by Wang et al. 21.Typically, 13 CO 2 gas (Isotope purity, 99 and chemical purity, 99.9, Tokyo Gas Chemicals Co., Ltd.) was employed instead of pure 12 CO 2 gas as the carbon source with the same reaction setting as described above.Gas products were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (JMS-K9, JEOL-GCQMS, Japan, and 6890N Network GC system, Agilent Technologies, USA) for detecting the products of 13 CO and other gas products. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were conducted using Materials Studio software 22.Based on XRD results, the preferentially exposed facet of Bi 2 WO 6 was (113).The (113) facet, with a thickness of four atomic layers, was therefore chosen as a basic configuration to build the top surface of Bi 2 WO 6 with GQDs and oxygen vacancy.The height of the vacuum layer is set as 14 A to avoid the interaction of neighboring layers. The Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) of the generalized gradient approximation 23 was used as the exchange-correlation function.A plane wave cut-off energy of 550 eV, a 3 3 1 k-point mesh for the Brillouin zone sampling, and the ultrasoft pseudopotential were set for the accurate geometry optimizations and electronic structure calculations.The DFTU approach was introduced to accurately describe our systems with localized d electrons (i.e., W 5d in the Bi 2 WO 6 ).The U parameter was set to 3.0 eV for W 5d orbitals.The convergence tolerance of energy, maximum force, and maximum displacement were set to 1.0 10 -5 eV/atom, 0.03 eV/A, and 0.001 A, respectively. Oxygen vacancies in the BWO 6-x could be classified into two types: those Vo originated from cleavage of the Bi-O bond and those from the W-O bond (ESI , Table S1).To choose a more stable Vo type and thus simplify the configuration of BWO 6-x and GQDs/BWO 6-x , the corresponding formation energies were calculated, which is given by Eq. ( 1), where E B1 is the formation energy of oxygen vacancy.E BWO , E BWO6-x , and E O are the energies of perfect BWO semiconductor, BWO 6-x with one type of oxygen vacancies, and one single oxygen atom, respectively.The energy of one single oxygen atom is half of the total energy of an O 2 molecule (1/2E O2 ).The calculation results were listed in Table S1, indicating that type 1 (Vo from W-O) is more stable with a higher E F absolute value (-25.42 eV) compared to type 2 (-24.46 eV) and thus employed as the foundation for constructing the GQDs/BWO 6-x model.Similarly, possible adsorption sites of CO 2 on the GQDs/BWO 6-x surface were constructed, and their most stable configurations were determined according to the binding energy maximum principle (Table S1).The final configuration for CO 2 adsorption sites can be seen in Section 3.4.",

            "paragraph_text": "The SEM and TEM images of GQDs, GQDs/BWO, and GQDs/BWO 6-x are shown in Fig. 1.The flower-like GQDs/BWO 6-x microspheres were assembled from nanosheets.Fig. 1c shows that the average size of prepared GQDs was 2.2 nm.The lattice fringes, 0.313 nm, correspond to the (113) facet of Bi 2 WO 6 , which is one of the main exposed facets.The disordered lattice fringe of the boundary layer (surrounded by the blue dotted line) should be attributed to the existence of Vo.As shown in Fig. 1 m, the intensity profiles in the BWO (113) lattice region are uniformly distributed along the indicated green line l.In comparison, the intensity profiles in the boundary region are irregularly distributed along green line 2, suggesting the possible existence of Vo in the boundary region.The disorder in the boundary region presumably arises from alkali etching which partially dissolved the Bi 2 WO 6 crystal, thus introducing the oxygen vacancy.It can be seen from the elemental mapping images (Fig. 1h-l) that, in addition to the uniform distributions of B, W, and O from BWO, a small amount of C originated from GQDs was homogeneously dispersed on the GQDs/BWO 6-x sample. Fig. 2a shows the XRD pattern of BWO, GQDs/BWO, BWO 6-x , and GQDs/BWO 6-x .The peaks at 28.4 , 32.9 , 47.2 , 56.1 , and 58.4 were indexed to the (113), ( 200), ( 220), (313), and (119) facets of orthorhombic Bi 2 WO 6 (JCPDS no.73-2020), respectively.No peaks corresponding to GQDs were observed, which may be due to the tiny size and small amount of GQDs and high dispersion on the Bi 2 WO 6 surface.As seen in Fig. 2b, the (020)/(200) peaks of GQDs/BWO, BWO 6-x , and GQDs/BWO 6-x increasingly showed a shift towards a higher 2theta angle compared to BWO, with GQDs/BWO 6-x exhibiting an upmost and most apparent shift.The upshifts may be caused by residual surface stress of Bi 2 WO 6 arising from oxygen vacancy 22 and GQDs. To confirm the successful introduction of GQDs onto the BWO surface, FT-IR spectra of GQDs/BWO and GQDs/BWO 6-x were recorded.Fig. 2c shows the peaks at 1065 cm -1 assigned to the vibration of the C-O bond of GQDs.These peaks were absent in the spectrum of pure Bi 2 WO 6 . Peaks at 576, 728, and 1389 cm -1 were assigned to the stretching vibration of W-O, Bi-O, and to the W-O-W bridging stretching, respectively.The intensities of these absorptions were seen to increase with the introduction of Vo (BWO 6-x , GQDs/BWO 6-x ).The data indicate that more Bi-O and W-O bonds were exposed after alkali etching. XPS analysis was performed further to confirm the existence of Vo on GQDs/BWO 6-x .The C1s peak region can be deconvoluted into three peaks (Fig. 2e).The central C 1s peak at 284.8 eV may arise from the lattice structure of sp2 hybridized carbon atoms in the GQDs structure 18.The flat peaks at 287.0 eV correspond to the few C-O bonds contained in the GQDs.The asymmetric O 1s peak of BWO (Fig. 2f) could be deconvoluted into three peaks, ascribing to the lattice oxygen atoms as forms of Bi-O and W-O, and the surface-adsorbed oxygen species (hydroxyl, H 2 O, etc.), respectively 24.Surface oxygen vacancies tend to adsorb more surface oxygen species, which would increase the peak area at 530 eV.This would explain the peak area increase at 530.3 eV for GQDs/BWO 6-x compared to GQDs/BWO.In addition, O 1s binding energy (530.3eV) of GQDs/BWO 6-x showed a downward shift of 0.6 eV compared to GQDs/BWO 6 (530.9 eV).The shift can be ascribed to the change of electron density around O atoms after Vo introduction 19,25. The UV-vis absorption properties of BWO, BWO 6-x , GQDs/BWO, and GQDs/BWO 6-x were studied by UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectrometry.Fig. 3a shows that GQDs/BWO 6-x exhibited much stronger absorption in the UV region and the visible light range than the other catalysts. The TR-PL decay curves of BWO and GQDs/BWO 6-x were recorded in The i-t, PL spectra, and EIS curves were measured to investigate further the role of GQDs and Vo in suppressing the recombination of photogenerated h /e -pairs.The i-t curves are shown in Fig. 3c.The photocurrent intensities of GQDs/BWO 6-x , BWO 6-x , and GQDs/BWO are 13, 8.2, and 7.5 times higher than pristine BWO, respectively.The weak intensity of photoluminescence is an indication of the low recombination rate of light-driven h /e -pairs (ESI , Fig. S2a) 26.Photoluminescence intensity of the catalysts followed the order of GQDs/BWO 6-x BWO 6-x GQDs/BWO BWO.Fig. S2b exhibits that the SPS of GQDs/BWO 6-x reaches the highest intensity.All the above results indicated the highest capability of GQDs/BWO 6-x to suppress the recombination of h /e -pairs.The EIS spectra were measured to reveal the charge transfer resistance at the solid/solution interface.Fig. S2c exhibits that the semicircle diameter of GQDs/BWO 6-x is the least among all the samples, meaning a fast charge transfer process. Fig. 3d shows all the Eg values identified by the Tauc plot method 7.Eg of pristine Bi 2 WO 6 , BWO 6-x , GQDs/BWO, and GQDs/BWO 6-x were determined to be 2.69, 2.65, 2.62, and 2.55 eV, respectively.The lower bandgap of GQDs/BWO 6-x was beneficial to enhance visible-light absorption. XPS valence band spectra (Fig. S1) were recorded to determine the valence band (VB) edge of the above samples.The VB edge of BWO, BWO 6-x , GQDs/BWO, and GQDs/BWO 6-x were identified as 2.57, 1.67, 2.41, and 1.42 eV, respectively.According to the XPS valence spectra results and the Eg values, the detailed band structures of the above samples can be obtained and shown in Fig. 3d.The conduction bond (CB) edge of BWO moved to lower potentials, i.e., -0.95 eV of BWO 6-x and -1.13 eV of GQDs/BWO 6-x , which was mainly attributed to Vo decoration on its surface.This result indicated that the photogenerated CB electrons of GQDs/BWO 6-x owned a stronger reduction power than GQDs/BWO for converting CO 2 to CO and CH 4 , and GQDs/BWO 6-x possessed a narrower bandgap for enhancing solar light utilization efficiency. Four control experiments were conducted to investigate the origin of the carbonaceous gas products.The result (Table S2) shows that neither CH 4 nor CO was detected in the cases of light off, no entry of CO 2 , or no TEA, indicating that the light irradiation, CO 2 , and TEA were indispensable for the photocatalytic formation of carbonaceous fuels.However, when GQDs/BWO 6-x was absent, a tiny amount of CO (2.7 molg -1 h -1 ) and H 2 (4.2 molg -1 h -1 ) under 3 h of light irradiation was detected.The above results ascertain that neither the photocatalysts nor TEA were a potential source of CO.The carbonaceous products under visible light irradiation were derived from the photoreduction of CO 2 .By the way, all the CO and H 2 yield data in this paper were obtained by deducting the corresponding CO and H 2 yields, which were measured in the case of no addition of photocatalyst under various irradiation times to expel the calculation error and precisely evaluate the CO yield. We employed the isotope-labeled carbon dioxide ( 13 CO 2 ) as a substitute gas to further determine the origin of CO.As shown in the inset of Fig. 4c, the total ion chromatographic peak at 7.66 min can be assigned to CO.The primary MS signal at m/z 29 with a high abundance (Fig. 4c) belonged to 13 CO, and the others ( 13 C at m/z 13 and O at m/ z 16) corresponded to the fragments of 13 CO, confirming that the CO product exactly originated from the CO 2 photoreduction over GQDs/ BWO 6-x .In addition, the inevitable intake of air into the GC sampling needle during the sampling course would lead to the appearance of obvious peaks of O 2 (3.63 min) and N 2 (4.23 min) in the total ion chromatography. As illustrated in Fig. 4a, the maximum CO yield per hour for GQDs/ BWO 6-x was 43.9 molg -1 h -1 under visible light irradiation over 5 h. In comparison, the maximum CO yield for GQDs/BWO was 30.1 molg -1 h -1 , and the maximum CO yield for BWO was 26.6 molg -1 h -1 under the same conditions.The CO yield of GQDs/ BWO 6-x was ab.1.7 times BWO.The stability of GQDs/BWO 6-x was further investigated by a four-run recycling experiment under the same condition.The 5 h cumulative yield falls by 21 for CO after four cycles (Fig. 4b), indicating that GQDs/BWO 6-x possesses good cyclic stability.In addition, the XRD characteristic peaks of the recycled sample indexed to the (113), (020), (220), and (133) facets (Fig. 2a) kept almost unchanged as compared to the fresh sample, showing the stability of GQDs/BWO 6-x intuitively. The in-situ CO 2 adsorption DRIFTS IR spectra under visible light irradiation were recorded on GQDs/BWO 6-x samples to unravel the reaction pathway and elucidate the underlying reasons for the enhanced photocatalytic activity.As shown in Fig. 5a note that the adsorption peaks at 1620 -1689 cm -1 and 1290 cm -1 are assigned to the characteristic vibration mode of CO 2 , and the appearance of CO 2 peak implies the successful activation of the adsorbed CO 2 on the surface of GQDs/BWO 6-x 29. The temperature-programmed desorption (TPD-CO 2 ) was performed to understand the interactions between the composite surfaces and CO 2 .As shown in Fig. 5b, the peak intensity of GQDs/BWO 6-x is above that of pure GQDs/BWO, indicating higher CO 2 adsorption capacities than GQDs/BWO, which would benefit the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 .Similarly, BWO 6-x possessed more robust adsorption capacities than BWO.The peaks in the temperature ranges of 50 C-180 C, 180 C-360 C and 360 C-520 C, corresponded to strong physical adsorption, weak and powerful chemical adsorption toward CO 2 , respectively.For the type of powerful chemical adsorption, the peak intensity and area of GQDs/BWO 6-x at 360 -520 C were 20 and 5.2 times higher than those of BWO and GQDs/BWO, respectively.It confirmed the existence of the chemical binding of CO 2 molecules with the GQDs/BWO 6-x surface atoms. The in-situ EPR (Fig. S3) was performed to identify the free radical type over GQDs/BWO 6-x during the photocatalytic CO The weak intensity of the DMPO-OH signal could be caused by the scavenging effect of TEA toward the OH free radical.The effect of GQDs and oxygen vacancy on the band structures of composites were further unraveled by calculating the HOMO-LUMO and DOS of composites.As is known, the electrons of HOMO are most weakly held and tend to flow from HOMO on one molecule to LUMO on the other molecule.Fig. 5b shows that both HOMO and LUMO of GQDs/ BWO mainly confine in the GQDs molecules, indicating the photogenerated electrons are hard to separate and lead to a high recombination rate with photogenerated holes.In comparison, the photogenerated electrons on the Bi and O atoms that are remote to Vo tend to flow to the Vo-neighboring W and O atoms.It means that the photogenerated electrons are easy to separate with holes. The calculation results of the partial density of states (PDOS) of GQDs/BWO 6-x and GQDs/BWO indicated that the surface HOMO and LUMO of both samples were mainly composed of O 2p electrons.The CB edge of GQDs/BWO 6-x became more negative than that of GQDs/BWO, consistent with the measured values given by Fig. 3d, and manifested an enhanced reduction ability.Meanwhile, as shown in Fig. 5d, a new band marked with a red arrow appeared in the forbidden band of GQDs/ BWO 6-x , but no intermediate band emerged for GQDs/BWO.This new band should belong to Vo, leading to a bandgap narrowing and accepting more excited electrons. Charge density differences (Fig. S4) showed that the electron clouds were mainly distributed over the H atoms of GQDs and O atoms of BWO.The distributions of electronic accumulation in GQDs showed a clear tendency of electrons to move toward oxygen vacancy.Combined with the HOMO and LUMO results, we speculated that GQDs could acted as photosensitizers to generate a few electrons, which would transfer to the Vo-neighboring sites.Meanwhile, a mass of photogenerated electrons moved from the Vo-remote atoms of BWO to the Vo-neighboring sites to reduce the adsorbed CO 2 molecules. In terms of investigating the photocatalytic reduction route, the following equations can express the main steps according to the reference 30. Regarding Eq.2, various adsorption configurations for CO 2 were constructed (Table.S3), attempting to identify an optimal adsorption site by comparing the adsorption energy.The CO 2 molecule tended to bond weakly with the catalyst surface through a single-site bonding between the 2p orbital of sole C or O atom of the CO 2 molecule and the orbital of 2)).The CO desorption energy for GQDs/BWO 6-x was identified to be -0.71eV, close to that for Bi 2 WO 6 (-0.59 eV).This result implied that the surfaces of GQDs/BWO 6-x and BWO had a similar capability for desorption of CO to form free CO.Meanwhile, GQDs/BWO 6-x had lower CHO generation energy (absolute value: 0.70 eV) than bulk BWO (absolute value: 1.30 eV), indicating that the intermediate CO for GQDs/BWO 6-x was easier to be protonated to form CH 4 .More importantly, according to Li et al. 32, the protonation of COOH to form CO was a rate-determining step.The relative energy barrier for the transformation of COOH-GQDs/BWO 6-x to CO-GQDs/BWO 6-x (-0.46 eV -(-0.62 eV) 0.16 eV) was lower than that for COOH-BWO to CO-BWO (-0.2 eV -(-1.32 eV) 1.12 eV), meaning that the decoration by GQDs and Vo were beneficial to accelerate the transformation of COOH to CO.The above analysis is consistent with the results of activity tests. Based on the above results, a possible mechanism of photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 can be speculated (Fig. 6c andd).BWO was responsible for generating a mass of electrons under light irradiation, and GQDs could also produce a few electrons.Most photogenerated electrons preferred to move to the Vo-neighboring atoms, accelerating the charge separation.GQDs enabled the CB of BWO to be more negative and intensified the visible light response capacity.More negative CB was beneficial to enhance the reduction capability of composites.Oxygen vacancies served as the adsorption and activation sites for CO 2 .The CO 2 molecule was readily adsorbed at the Vo sites to form CO 2 and then converted to CO 2 -by gaining the photogenerated electrons.Other intermediates, including CHO and COOH, were further formed by combing with H formed by dissociation of H 2 O under the attack of holes andO 2 -free radicals.Finally, CO, CH 4 , and other carbonaceous fuels were produced.",

            "paragraph_text": "GQDs modified BWO 6-x was successfully prepared by a microwaveassisted hydrothermal process.The as-developed GQDs/BWO 6-x nanocomposites demonstrated impressive visible light photoactivity for CO 2 reduction to CO.The activity test results showed that the maximum CO yield per hour for GQDs/BWO 6-x was 43.9 molg -1 h -1 under visible light irradiation over three hours.The CO yield of GQDs/Bi 2 WO 6-x is 1.7-fold higher than pristine BWO.The isotope-labeled experiment showed that the prominent peak at m/z 29 achieved a high abundance of 13 CO 2 , proving that CO indeed originated from the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .

Fig.3b.The inset shows the calculated photoluminescence decay lifetime ( 1 and 2 ) and their magnitude factors (A 1 and A 2 ) of charge carriers.The GQDs/BWO 6-x composite had both longer fast decay lifetime ( 1 3.3 ns) and slow decay lifetime ( 2 1.3 ns) in CO 2 than that of BWO ( 1 2.7 ns, 2 1.2 ns), indicating its better separation efficiency of photogenerated charge carriers21.The i-t, PL spectra, and EIS curves were measured to investigate further the role of GQDs and Vo in suppressing the recombination of photogenerated h /e -pairs.The i-t curves are shown in Fig.3c.The photocurrent intensities of GQDs/BWO 6-x , BWO 6-x , and GQDs/BWO are 13, 8.2, and 7.5 times higher than pristine BWO, respectively.The weak intensity of photoluminescence is an indication of the low recombination rate of light-driven h /e -pairs (ESI , Fig.S2a)26.Photoluminescence intensity of the catalysts followed the order of GQDs/BWO 6-x BWO 6-x GQDs/BWO BWO.Fig.S2bexhibits that the SPS of GQDs/BWO 6-x reaches the highest intensity.All the above results indicated the highest capability of GQDs/BWO 6-x to suppress the recombination of h /e -pairs.The EIS spectra were measured to reveal the charge transfer resistance at the solid/solution interface.Fig.S2cexhibits that the semicircle diameter of GQDs/BWO 6-x is the least among all the samples, meaning a fast charge transfer process.Fig.3dshowsall the Eg values identified by the Tauc plot method7.Eg of pristine Bi 2 WO 6 , BWO 6-x , GQDs/BWO, and GQDs/BWO 6-x were determined to be 2.69, 2.65, 2.62, and 2.55 eV, respectively.The Fig. 3.

The DFT calculation results revealed that the energy barrier of GQDs/BWO 6-x (0.16 eV) for transforming the intermediate COOH to CO, a rate-determining step, was lower than BWO (1.12 eV), leading to its enhanced photocatalytic performance.Oxygen vacancies localized the photogenerated electrons and promoted the electron-hole separation efficiency.The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra indicated that GQDs intensified the visible-light absorption capability.Besides, the modification of GQDs and Vo enabled the CB of BWO (-0.12 eV) to be more negative (CB of GQDs/Bi 2 WO 6-x : -1.13 eV), which is beneficial in enhancing the reduction capability of composites.
