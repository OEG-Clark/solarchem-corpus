Two methods, a photodeposition method (PD) and an impregnation method (IMP), and their combinations were examined for loading of Ag and TMO x (TMO x NiO x , CoO x , FeO x ) dual cocatalysts on the CTO sample.The loading amounts in the present study were desired to be 2.0 and 0.5 wt for Ag and TMO x species, respectively, for all the samples. In the simultaneous PD method, 1 g of the CTO sample was dispersed in 360 mL of pure water containing both AgNO 3 and a required precursor such as Ni(NO 3 ) 2 .6H 2 O, Co(NO 3 ) 2 .6H 2 O and Fe(NO 3 ) 2 .6H 2 O, in an inner-irradiation-type reaction vessel, and a bubbling flow of Ar gas was used to exclude the air for 1 h before photoirradiation.Then the suspension was photoirradiated by a 100 W high-pressure Hg lamp located at the center of the vessel with a bubbling flow of Ar gas for 2.5 h.Then, the resulting suspension was filtered and dried in air at 373 K for 24 h.These samples were referred to as Ag(PD)-TMO x (PD)/CTO samples. Additional two samples were prepared by a two-step PD method, in which Ag and NiO x species were consecutively photodeposited one by one on the CTO photocatalyst: Ag species was first photodeposited on the CTO sample, followed by the photodeposition of NiO x species to give the NiO x (PD)/Ag(PD)/CTO sample, while the Ag(PD)/NiO x (PD)/CTO sample was prepared in the reverse order. In the simultaneous IMP method, the CTO sample was soaked in a solution (100 mL) containing the two precursors for Ag and TMO x and continuously stirred in a water bath at 120 rpm at 353 K to completely evaporate whole of water.Then, the resulting samples were dried in air at 373 K for 24 h, and calcined at 723 K for 1 h in the furnace.The samples were denoted as Ag(IMP)-TMO x (IMP)/CTO samples.In a combination of the IMP and PD methods, a TMO x species was first loaded by the IMP method, followed by loading Ag with the PD method, providing the Ag(PD)/TMO x (IMP)/CTO samples.The NiO x (-IMP)/Ag(PD)/CTO sample was prepared in the inverse order. The single Ag cocatalyst sample and the single TMO x cocatalyst samples were also prepared to give the Ag(PD)/CTO, TMO x (PD)/CTO, and TMO x (IMP)/CTO samples. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of all samples were recorded with a Lab X XRD-6000 (Shimadzu).Morphologies of the samples were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with a JSM-890 (JEOL).Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained with energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) by a JEOL JEM-2100F at 200 kV in the Joint Research Centre of Kindai University.Ag K-edge X-ray absorption fine structures (XAFS) were recorded at BL01B1 of SPring-8 (Hyogo, Japan) in a transmission mode with a Si(311) double crystal monochromator.The actual loaded amount of cocatalysts was evaluated by XRF with an EDX-8000 (Shimadzu) according to each calibration curve that was experimentally obtained from a series of reference samples prepared by the impregnation method.The diff ;use reflectance (DR) UV-vis spectra were measured using a V-670 (JASCO) equipped with an integrating sphere covered with BaSO 4 that was used as a reference. Photocatalytic activity test for CO 2 reduction by H 2 O was carried out using a flow system with an inner-irradiation-type reaction vessel at ambient pressure 3.The photocatalyst (0.3 g) was dispersed in ion-exchanged water (350 mL) containing 0.5 M NaHCO 3 , and then suspended using magnetically stirring in a bubbling flow of gaseous CO at a flow rate of 30 mL min -1 without radiation for 1 h.The photocatalytic reaction was performed at reaction temperature of 290 K by using a 100 W high-pressure mercury lamp with 44 mW cm -2 measured at 254 10 nm in wavelength.The amounts of evolved CO, H 2 , and O were detected by using an on-line gas chromatograph (Shimadzu, GC-8A, TCD, Shincarbon ST column, argon carrier).The CO, H 2 , and O were generated as the main products under photoirradiation, where CO was the main reductive product from CO 2 and H 2 was produced by water splitting as a competitive product 17.The selectivity toward CO evolution among the reductive products, S CO , and the ratio of the consumed electrons and holes, R(e -/h ), were calculated using the equations shown below 18, where R CO , R H2 , and R O2 describe the production rate of CO, H 2 , and O 2 , respectively. In the H 2 evolution tests, we added methanol (14 ) as an electron donor (a reductant) to make the reductive reaction to be the rate determining step, while in the O 2 evolution test NaIO 3 (10 mM) was added as an electron acceptor (an oxidant) to make the oxidative reaction to be the rate determining step.", "vote": "0"}, {"paper_title": "Effect of transition metal oxide cocatalyst on the photocatalytic activity of Ag loaded CaTiO3 for CO2 reduction with water and water splitting", "doi": "10.1016/j.apcatb.2021.119899", "validator": "domain expert 1", "category": "catalyst", "source": "In this study, the effects of the Ag-TMO x dual cocatalyst (TM Fe, Co, Ni) and the loading methods on the activity of the CTO photocatalyst for CO 2 conversion to CO and O 2 and water splitting to H 2 and O 2 were investigated and the following matters were clarified.", "context": "In this study, the effects of the Ag-TMO x dual cocatalyst (TM Fe, Co, Ni) and the loading methods on the activity of the CTO photocatalyst for CO 2 conversion to CO and O 2 and water splitting to H 2 and O 2 were investigated and the following matters were clarified.1) Compared to the single Ag co-catalyst, the Ag-TMO x dual cocatalyst provided a comparable or less activity for CO evolution and a higher activity for H 2 evolution.2) The photocatalytic activity depended on the loading methods.The photodeposition method gave higher activity for CO formation and the impregnation method gave higher activity for H 2 formation.3) A TMO x cocatalyst can improve the activity of the CTO photocatalyst for water splitting to form H 2 and O 2 while the Ag cocatalyst can improve the activity for not the water splitting but CO 2 reduction.

In the simultaneous IMP method, the CTO sample was soaked in a solution (100 mL) containing the two precursors for Ag and TMO x and continuously stirred in a water bath at 120 rpm at 353 K to completely evaporate whole of water.Then, the resulting samples were dried in air at 373 K for 24 h, and calcined at 723 K for 1 h in the furnace.The samples were denoted as Ag(IMP)-TMO x (IMP)/CTO samples.In a combination of the IMP and PD methods, a TMO x species was first loaded by the IMP method, followed by loading Ag with the PD method, providing the Ag(PD)/TMO x (IMP)/CTO samples.The NiO x (-IMP)/Ag(PD)/CTO sample was prepared in the inverse order. The single Ag cocatalyst sample and the single TMO x cocatalyst samples were also prepared to give the Ag(PD)/CTO, TMO x (PD)/CTO, and TMO x (IMP)/CTO samples. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of all samples were recorded with a Lab X XRD-6000 (Shimadzu).Morphologies of the samples were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with a JSM-890 (JEOL).Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained with energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) by a JEOL JEM-2100F at 200 kV in the Joint Research Centre of Kindai University.Ag K-edge X-ray absorption fine structures (XAFS) were recorded at BL01B1 of SPring-8 (Hyogo, Japan) in a transmission mode with a Si(311) double crystal monochromator.The actual loaded amount of cocatalysts was evaluated by XRF with an EDX-8000 (Shimadzu) according to each calibration curve that was experimentally obtained from a series of reference samples prepared by the impregnation method.The diff ;use reflectance (DR) UV-vis spectra were measured using a V-670 (JASCO) equipped with an integrating sphere covered with BaSO 4 that was used as a reference. Photocatalytic activity test for CO 2 reduction by H 2 O was carried out using a flow system with an inner-irradiation-type reaction vessel at ambient pressure 3.The photocatalyst (0.3 g) was dispersed in ion-exchanged water (350 mL) containing 0.5 M NaHCO 3 , and then suspended using magnetically stirring in a bubbling flow of gaseous CO at a flow rate of 30 mL min -1 without radiation for 1 h.The photocatalytic reaction was performed at reaction temperature of 290 K by using a 100 W high-pressure mercury lamp with 44 mW cm -2 measured at 254 10 nm in wavelength.The amounts of evolved CO, H 2 , and O were detected by using an on-line gas chromatograph (Shimadzu, GC-8A, TCD, Shincarbon ST column, argon carrier).The CO, H 2 , and O were generated as the main products under photoirradiation, where CO was the main reductive product from CO 2 and H 2 was produced by water splitting as a competitive product 17.The selectivity toward CO evolution among the reductive products, S CO , and the ratio of the consumed electrons and holes, R(e -/h ), were calculated using the equations shown below 18, where R CO , R H2 , and R O2 describe the production rate of CO, H 2 , and O 2 , respectively. In the H 2 evolution tests, we added methanol (14 ) as an electron donor (a reductant) to make the reductive reaction to be the rate determining step, while in the O 2 evolution test NaIO 3 (10 mM) was added as an electron acceptor (an oxidant) to make the oxidative reaction to be the rate determining step.", "vote": "0"}, {"paper_title": "Effect of transition metal oxide cocatalyst on the photocatalytic activity of Ag loaded CaTiO3 for CO2 reduction with water and water splitting", "doi": "10.1016/j.apcatb.2021.119899", "validator": "domain expert 1", "category": "light source", "source": "Fig. 4.

Two methods, a photodeposition method (PD) and an impregnation method (IMP), and their combinations were examined for loading of Ag and TMO x (TMO x NiO x , CoO x , FeO x ) dual cocatalysts on the CTO sample.The loading amounts in the present study were desired to be 2.0 and 0.5 wt for Ag and TMO x species, respectively, for all the samples. In the simultaneous PD method, 1 g of the CTO sample was dispersed in 360 mL of pure water containing both AgNO 3 and a required precursor such as Ni(NO 3 ) 2 .6H 2 O, Co(NO 3 ) 2 .6H 2 O and Fe(NO 3 ) 2 .6H 2 O, in an inner-irradiation-type reaction vessel, and a bubbling flow of Ar gas was used to exclude the air for 1 h before photoirradiation.Then the suspension was photoirradiated by a 100 W high-pressure Hg lamp located at the center of the vessel with a bubbling flow of Ar gas for 2.5 h.Then, the resulting suspension was filtered and dried in air at 373 K for 24 h.These samples were referred to as Ag(PD)-TMO x (PD)/CTO samples. Additional two samples were prepared by a two-step PD method, in which Ag and NiO x species were consecutively photodeposited one by one on the CTO photocatalyst: Ag species was first photodeposited on the CTO sample, followed by the photodeposition of NiO x species to give the NiO x (PD)/Ag(PD)/CTO sample, while the Ag(PD)/NiO x (PD)/CTO sample was prepared in the reverse order. In the simultaneous IMP method, the CTO sample was soaked in a solution (100 mL) containing the two precursors for Ag and TMO x and continuously stirred in a water bath at 120 rpm at 353 K to completely evaporate whole of water.Then, the resulting samples were dried in air at 373 K for 24 h, and calcined at 723 K for 1 h in the furnace.The samples were denoted as Ag(IMP)-TMO x (IMP)/CTO samples.In a combination of the IMP and PD methods, a TMO x species was first loaded by the IMP method, followed by loading Ag with the PD method, providing the Ag(PD)/TMO x (IMP)/CTO samples.The NiO x (-IMP)/Ag(PD)/CTO sample was prepared in the inverse order. The single Ag cocatalyst sample and the single TMO x cocatalyst samples were also prepared to give the Ag(PD)/CTO, TMO x (PD)/CTO, and TMO x (IMP)/CTO samples. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of all samples were recorded with a Lab X XRD-6000 (Shimadzu).Morphologies of the samples were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with a JSM-890 (JEOL).Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained with energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) by a JEOL JEM-2100F at 200 kV in the Joint Research Centre of Kindai University.Ag K-edge X-ray absorption fine structures (XAFS) were recorded at BL01B1 of SPring-8 (Hyogo, Japan) in a transmission mode with a Si(311) double crystal monochromator.The actual loaded amount of cocatalysts was evaluated by XRF with an EDX-8000 (Shimadzu) according to each calibration curve that was experimentally obtained from a series of reference samples prepared by the impregnation method.The diff ;use reflectance (DR) UV-vis spectra were measured using a V-670 (JASCO) equipped with an integrating sphere covered with BaSO 4 that was used as a reference. Photocatalytic activity test for CO 2 reduction by H 2 O was carried out using a flow system with an inner-irradiation-type reaction vessel at ambient pressure 3.The photocatalyst (0.3 g) was dispersed in ion-exchanged water (350 mL) containing 0.5 M NaHCO 3 , and then suspended using magnetically stirring in a bubbling flow of gaseous CO at a flow rate of 30 mL min -1 without radiation for 1 h.The photocatalytic reaction was performed at reaction temperature of 290 K by using a 100 W high-pressure mercury lamp with 44 mW cm -2 measured at 254 10 nm in wavelength.The amounts of evolved CO, H 2 , and O were detected by using an on-line gas chromatograph (Shimadzu, GC-8A, TCD, Shincarbon ST column, argon carrier).The CO, H 2 , and O were generated as the main products under photoirradiation, where CO was the main reductive product from CO 2 and H 2 was produced by water splitting as a competitive product 17.The selectivity toward CO evolution among the reductive products, S CO , and the ratio of the consumed electrons and holes, R(e -/h ), were calculated using the equations shown below 18, where R CO , R H2 , and R O2 describe the production rate of CO, H 2 , and O 2 , respectively. In the H 2 evolution tests, we added methanol (14 ) as an electron donor (a reductant) to make the reductive reaction to be the rate determining step, while in the O 2 evolution test NaIO 3 (10 mM) was added as an electron acceptor (an oxidant) to make the oxidative reaction to be the rate determining step.", "vote": "1"}, {"paper_title": "Effect of transition metal oxide cocatalyst on the photocatalytic activity of Ag loaded CaTiO3 for CO2 reduction with water and water splitting", "doi": "10.1016/j.apcatb.2021.119899", "validator": "domain expert 1", "category": "operation mode", "source": "Photocatalytic activity test for CO 2 reduction by H 2 O was carried out using a flow system with an inner-irradiation-type reaction vessel at ambient pressure 3.", "context": "The CTO samples used here was prepared by a flux method in the same manner as our previous work 9.Starting materials, CaCO 3 (Kojundo, 99.99 ), rutile TiO 2 (Kojundo, 99.9 ) as solutes and NaCl (Kishida 99.5 ) as a flux were weighted and mixed physically in a mortar, where the molar ratio of CaCO 3 to TiO 2 was 1.05:1, and that of CTO to NaCl was 1:1.The mixture was put into an alumina crucible, which was loosely covered by a lid, heated in an electric furnace at a rate of 200 K h -1 up to 1473 K, held at this temperature for 10 h, and then slowly cooled at a rate of 100 K h -1 to 773 K, followed by being naturally cooled to room temperature.The obtained powder was thoroughly washed with hot water (353 K, 500 mL) for 15 min and filtrated, and this washing step was repeated 3 times to completely remove any residual salt, then dried at 373 K for 24 h to obtain the CTO sample.
