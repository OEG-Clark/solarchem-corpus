For measurement, the monochromatic light by using the bandpass filter with the precision of l 10 nm was employed, including the 385 nm, 420 nm, 450 nm, 485 nm, 535 nm, and 595 nm.The amount of H 2 evolution was collected after the light irradiation for 60 min.AQE under the different wavelengths irradiation was calculated based on the following equation ( 2) and ( 3): The number of H 2 molecules can be calculated from the generation rate of H 2 under 420 nm is 136.62 mmolh A1 .Thus, the received electron number of the products: 2 A 136.62 A 10 A6 / 3600 14 7.59 A 10 A8 mols A1 . According to hc/l, the energy of the single-photon at l 14 420 nm is calculated to be 4.736 A 10 A19 J, h and c are the Planck constant 6.63 A 10 A34 Js and the speed of light 3 A 10 8 m/s.Avogadro's number is 6.022 A 10 23 .The light intensity was measured to be 7.15 mW/cm 2 by calibrating with a light power meter.The radius of the illumination area of the reactor was 3.5 cm.Thus, the total incident photos number can be calculated to be 9.643 A 10 A7 mols A1 . Thus, the AQE 14 7.59 A 10 A8 mols A1 / 9.643 A 10 A7 mols A1 A 100 14 7.87 The reaction system is the same as above mentioned instrument.Typically, 30 mg of each catalyst was dispersed in 80 mL of an aqueous solution containing 8 mL of triethanolamine (TEOA), used as a sacrificial agent and 0.2 wt of Pt as the reductive cocatalyst prepared by a typical in-situ photo-deposition route from the precursor of H 2 PtCl 6 .Then the reacting solution was irradiated by the Xe lamp (l 420 nm) and the generated H 2 gas was analyzed by gas chromatography with a TCD detector. The reaction system is the same as above mentioned instrument.Typically, 30 mg catalyst, 1 mmol CoCl 2 , and 15 mg 2,2bipyridine was added in 5 mL 10 TOA/acetonitrile solution with 0.5 mL H 2 O.The reactor was degassed three times for 60 min to remove air and filled into the high pure CO 2 gas (99.999).The gaseous products (CO, CH 4 ) were investigated by an FID detector equipped with a mechanized by gas chromatography and the generation of H 2 was simultaneously detected by the TCD detector.", "vote": "1"}, {"paper_title": "Efficient photoreforming of lignocellulose into H2 and photocatalytic CO2 reduction via in-plane surface dyadic heterostructure of porous polymeric carbon nitride", "doi": "10.1016/j.carbon.2020.07.080", "validator": "domain expert 1", "category": "reaction medium", "source": "Based on the context, the reaction medium is liquid as the hydrogen evolution reaction occurs in the presence of xylose or triethanolamine, which are dissolved in a liquid solution.", "context": "In summary, we have reported a charge transfer steering through optimizing the nucleation process strategy by using an organic amine base (NEA) modulating thin porous PCN nanostructure to improve visible-light photocatalytic activity.Benefiting from the formation of surface dyadic heterostructure and curly-like porous configuration, HCN-NEA possesses the strong visible lightharvesting ability, efficient separation of charge carriers, abundant in-plane holes in nanosheets as well as the enhanced oxidation ability.Thus, the hydrogen evolution rate of HCN-NEA by in the presence of xylose under visible light achieves 122.77 mmolh A1 (i.e. 4092mmolh A1 g A1 ) with an apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 7.87 (l 14 420 nm), 15.6 times higher than that of BCN.And HCN-NEA has the H 2 evolution rate of 661.3 mmolh A1 (i.e.22043 mmolh A1 g A1 ), 56.0 folds than pristine BCN (11.8 mmolh A1 ) and together with an superior AQE of 41.2 (l 14 420 nm) by using triethanolamine as sacrificial agent, as well as a high CO reduction rate of 56.3 mmolh A1 from the CO 2 conversion, 24.5 times than BCN.This well demonstrates the advantage of surface dyadic heterostructure and thin porous nanostructure in optimizing the photocatalytic activity of the PCN photocatalyst.Our findings signify the great potential application in the fields of heterogeneous organic transformation, environmental remediation, and energy conversion and also provide a feasible strategy for steering the charge transfer and simultaneously realize the wide spectrum visible-light Fig. 1.Schematic for photoinduced carrier transfer behaviors of (a) BCN and (b) HCN-NEA.(A colour version of this figure can be viewed online.)
