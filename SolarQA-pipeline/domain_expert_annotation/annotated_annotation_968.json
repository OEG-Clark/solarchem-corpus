The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected on a D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer (Bruker) using Cu K radiation ( 0.1541 nm) in the scanning range of 4-50 .The Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were recorded on a Nicolet NEXUS670 spectrometer (ThermoFisher) with a resolution of 4 cm -1 .The textural properties of the prepared samples were determined by N 2 adsorption at -196 C using an ASAP 2020 apparatus (Micromeritics Instrument Corp.).The specific surface areas, S BET and S Langmuir , were calculated using the multiple-point Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and Langmuir isotherm methods, respectively.The total pore volumes, V total , were calculated from the adsorbed amounts in the adsorption branches at a relative pressure of p/p 0 0.97.The scanning electron microscope (SEM) was carried out on an S-4800 apparatus (Hitachi) equipped with a field emission gun.The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) was conducted on a JEOL JEM-1200 working at kV.The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out on Thermo Scientific EscaLab 250Xi using Al K radiation (ThermoFisher).The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-vis DRS) were recorded on a Nicolet Evolution 500 Spectrophotometer (ThermoFisher) with BaSO as reflectance standard from 200 to 800 nm.The 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) was carried out on a Bruker AVANCE III 500 M system (500 MHz).The isotopic 13 CO 2 reduction was performed in an NMR tube filled with the photocatalyst in a CD 3 CN/TEOA (5:1 in volume ratio) solution.The photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded on an F-7000 spectrometer (Hitachi) excited at 326 nm.The time-resolved PL spectra of the samples at 480 nm emission were recorded with an Edinburgh FLS980 spectrophotometer at an excitation wavelength of 350 nm.The electrochemical measurements were carried out with a CHI760E workstation (Shanghai Chenhua Instruments Co.) in a conventional three-electrode cell using a Pt plate and an Ag/AgCl electrode as the counter electrode and a reference electrode, respectively.The photocatalyst powder (3 mg) deposited on the fluoride tin oxide (FTO) substrate glass was employed as the working electrode.The electrolyte was a 0.5 mol L -1 aqueous solution of Na 2 SO 4 without additive and was purged with N 2 gas for 1 h prior to the measurements.A 300 W PLS-SXE 300D Xenon lamp (Beijing Perfectlight) system was applied as the excitation light source equipped with a UV cutoff filter and an IR-cut filter, which was the same light source for the photocatalytic reaction.The Mott-Schottky curves were measured at a frequency of 200, 500, or 800 Hz, respectively. The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was performed in an on-line CO 2 reduction system (Beijing Perfect Light Technology Co., Ltd.).Typically, 15 mg of the photocatalyst was added into the reaction flask, degassed and purged with CO 2 .A mixture of MeCN and TEOA (110 mL in total) with a volume ratio of 10 to 1 was degassed by CO 2 to remove the dissolved O 2 , and then injected into the reaction flask.The reaction proceeded under the irradiation of a Xe lamp (300 W) with a UV-cut filter and an IR-cut filter (800 nm 420 nm) at room temperature for 10 h.The formed HCOOH was detected by an ion chromatography (930 Compact IC pro, Metrohm) with a Metrosep A supp 5 250/4.0column.A mixture of 3.2 mM Na 2 CO 3 and 1.0 mM NaHCO 3 was used as eluent.The gaseous reaction products were also analyzed using a GC (Agilent 6890A) with a HP-5 capillary column for a flame ionization detector (FID) and a 5A molecular sieve packed column for a thermal conductivity detector (TCD).For the reusability test, after the reaction, the photocatalyst was separated from the reaction medium, repeatedly washed with deionized water twice, and then dried overnight in a vacuum oven at 120 C before the next run.", "vote": "1"}]
