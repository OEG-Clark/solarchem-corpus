However, based on the context of the experiment involving photocatalytic CO2 reduction to CO, it is likely that the reaction was conducted in a gaseous phase, as CO2 is a gas and the process involves light irradiation and catalysts. The text does not provide a definitive answer, so the most accurate response is 'None'.", "reactor type": "None", "operation mode": "None"}
