{"catalyst": "TiO 2 /MWCNTs powder", "co_catalyst": "The text does not mention a co-catalyst. It details the use of nanocomposites, PEI-grafted nanotubes, and TiO2 as catalysts, with Argon used as a bubbling gas to avoid air presence.", "light source": "SANOLUX lamp (near UV) and Xe-Halogen lamp (visible range)", "lamp": "The experiment used a SANOLUX lamp and a Xe-Halogen lamp.", "reaction medium": "Liquid", "reactor type": "The text describes a photoreactor with a jacket for temperature control and mentions bubbling of Argon and CO2, indicating a suspension-type reactor. While not explicitly stated, the description aligns most closely with a slurry reactor or a fixed-bed reactor with a liquid phase.", "operation mode": "The experiment was performed in a continuous mode, maintaining a constant temperature of approximately 25\u00b0C via water circulation around the photoreactor."}
