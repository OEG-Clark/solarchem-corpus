{"catalyst": "Pt or Cu-loaded TiO2 was used as the catalyst in the experiment.", "co_catalyst": "FeSO 4 solution was used as a co-catalyst in the experiment, specifically as a suspension for the H 2 -photocatalyst.", "light source": "Two 300 W xenon lamps with AM 1.5G filters were used as the light source.", "lamp": "Xenon lamps", "reaction medium": "Both liquid and gas phases were used as reaction mediums. The O2-generation side used a liquid phase (Fe2(SO4)3 solution), while the CO2-hydrogenation side used both a liquid phase (FeSO4 solution) with the catalyst suspended and a gas phase with the catalyst spread on a quartz plate.", "reactor type": "twin reactor", "operation mode": "Batch"}
