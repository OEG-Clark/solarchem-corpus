{"catalyst": "The text does not explicitly state a catalyst used in the experiment. However, it mentions Ag/nsGa2O3 (1123 K) and Ag/-Ga2O3 as tested samples in photocatalytic CO2 reduction, suggesting these might function as photocatalysts.", "co_catalyst": "Methanol and NaHCO3 are used in the experiment. The text states that the sample was dispersed in an aqueous solution of NaHCO3 (1 M) and 2 mL of methanol.", "light source": "UV", "lamp": "A 300 W Xe lamp was used as the UV source.", "reaction medium": "The experiment utilizes both liquid and gas as reaction mediums. Liquid nitrogen is used for BET measurements, and reactant gas is introduced into the in-situ IR cell.", "reactor type": "None", "operation mode": "The experiment utilizes a continuous operation mode, as indicated by the in-situ measurements and continuous flow of gases during characterization (e.g., CO2 adsorption and FT-IR measurements)."}
