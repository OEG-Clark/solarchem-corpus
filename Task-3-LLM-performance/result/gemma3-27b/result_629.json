{"catalyst": "The text does not explicitly state the catalyst used in the experiment, but mentions copper and gold in the promoted catalysts.", "co_catalyst": "2-propanol acts as a hydrogen donor, and oxygen is observed as a co-product.", "light source": "125 W mercury UVA lamp", "lamp": "The experiment used a 125 W mercury UVA lamp.", "reaction medium": "The reaction medium is not explicitly stated as liquid or gas, but the text indicates the experiments were conducted with a powder sample placed in a quartz cell, and mentions avoiding light absorption *from the reaction medium*. This suggests a liquid or gaseous medium is present, but the exact nature isn't specified. Therefore, based on the choices provided, the answer is Liquid.", "reactor type": "Fixed-bed", "operation mode": "The experiment utilizes both static conditions and a fixed bed reactor, with tests performed for a relatively long time (6 hours). It also mentions a thin film reactor setup for comparison."}
