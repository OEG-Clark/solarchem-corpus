The XRD experiments were preformed using a Siemens D-500 powder diffractometer with Cu Ka radiation (40 kV, 41 mA), 0.024step size and 1 s step time from 5to 90.The Bragg-Brentano focusing geometry was employed with an automatic divergence slit (irradiated sample length was 12.5 nm), a receiving slit of 0.1 nm, a fixed slit of 4a nd a proportional counter as a detector. Scanning electron microscopy images were obtained with a Hitachi S-800 field emission microscope using an acceleration voltage of 20 kV.Samples were placed on a stage especially made for SEM.Samples were coated with Au prior to analysis and imaged directly.SEM images were recorded at magnification of 5000 and 10000.The magnification was calibrated in pixel/nm on the camera.The chemical composition of the samples was determined by X-ray energy dispersion spectrum (EDS) with accelerating voltage of 20 kV. The diffuse reflectance UV-Vis was measured with a Cary 300 Bio UV-visible spectrophotometer.Powder samples were loaded in a quartz cell with Suprasil windows, and spectra were collected in the range from 300 to 800 nm against quartz standard. Photocatalytic reactions were carried out in a continuous flow reactor.The catalyst powder (0.14 g) was dispersed in a reactant solution (50 ml) in a down-window type irradiation cell made of Pyrex glass (75 ml).Potassium bicarbonate (0.2 M) aqueous solutions were employed as an absorbent of carbon dioxide and the ultra pure CO 2 were added continuously into the reactor for 1 h to remove oxygen in the water, and saturated carbon dioxide in the solution.A cooling system combined with water pump was used to keep the temperature of the reactor under room temperature.Light was switched on to start the reaction, and the irradiation was continued for 20 h.The light source was a 500 W halogen lamp (Ever bright; H-500).After 20 h, the reaction solution was centrifuged for 10 min, and then 10 l of the upper stratum was drawn for analyzing the constitution.The amount of methanol was determined by a gas chromatograph (China Chromatography; GC-8900, Poropack-QS column, flame ionization detector, helium carrier gas)."}, {"title": "Results_and_discussion", "content": "As shown in Fig. 1, methanol can be produced from carbon dioxide, which exists in water as CO 2 (g), H 2 CO 3 , CO 2A 3 etc.with different potentials.The potentials of conduction band of InTaO 4 are more negative than those of methanol yield, while the potential of valence band of InTaO 4 was more positive than those of methanol yield and the formation of methanol can occur even without electric power.The process for photocatalysis of semiconductors is considered as the direct absorption of a photon by band gap of the materials and generation of electron-hole pairs in the semiconductor particles.The excitation of an electron from the valence band to the conduction band is initiated by light absorption with energy equal to or greater than the band gap of the semiconductor.The information of band structure is definitely very important for understanding of the photocatalytic reaction. The XRD patterns of InTaO 4 samples prepared by solid-state reaction at 1100 C well consisted with monoclinic InTaO 4 spectrum, space group P2/c, indicated that the samples were completely crystallized in the wolframite-type structure InTaO 4 and have major peaks at around 2h 23.967(A1 1 0), 29.356(A1 1 1) and 29.899(1 1 1).The crystal lattice parameters were refined as follows: a 4.83300 (A1) A , b 5.77800 (1) A , c 5.15700 (1) A and b 91.380.The indexed result is in good agreement with that reported in the JCPDS database card (No. 25-0391).Ye and co-workers 10 have reported the structural refinements of InTaO 4 .The InTaO 4 compound belongs to the monoclinic system, space group P2/c, a 5.1552 (1), b 5.7751 (1), c 4.8264 (1) A and b 91.373(1).The structure was composed of two kinds of octahedral: InO 6 octahedron and TaO 6 octahedron.The InO 6 octahedron was connected to each other to form zigzag chains by sharing edge.These InO 6 chains were connected through TaO 6 octahedron to form the three dimensional network. InTaO 4 sample was assembled by a lot of tiny particles.These tiny particles were agglomerated in irregular shape with particle size of ca.1-2 lm.Many pellets were observed on InTaO 4 particles when loading with NiO cocatalysts.These small particles are NiO as confirmed by EDS.It should be noted that such NiO particles were not homogeneously dispersed on InTaO 4 . Fig. 2 shows the diffuse reflectance spectra of the InTaO 4 samples.The InTaO 4 compound showed obvious absorption in visible light region up to 465 nm.The band gap of InTaO 4 was estimated to be about 2.7 eV from the onset of the absorption spectra.For 1.0 wt. NiO-InTaO 4 after calcination, an obvious absorption in the visible light region was observed and the band gap of 1.0 wt. NiO-InTaO 4 was 2.6 eV.The band gap of NiO-InTaO 4 did not change from that of InTaO 4 , but the absorbance of InTaO 4 increased with the addition of NiO cocatalyst.The adsorption in the visible light range further increased after reduction-oxidation pretreatment. An obvious absorption in the visible light region was observed, although the absorption was weak.This shows that InTaO 4 has the ability to respond to the visible light irradiation.The band structure of InTaO 4 (Fig. 1), reveals that InTaO 4 can reduce CO 2 under the visible light irradiation.The results are in good agreement with the observed photocatalytic activity as discussed below, which shows that the appearance of electrons from the valence band to the conduction band initiated by visible light absorption results in methanol yield.The band gap of InTaO 4 was 2.7 eV, which correlates with the results reported 10. InTaO 4 with NiO-cocatalyst after pretreatment was suspended in 0.2 M KHCO 3 aqueous solution.The methanol yield (shown in Fig. 3) of 1.0 wt. NiO-InTaO 4 R500-O200 was calculated to be 1.394 lmol h A1 g A1 in the first 20 h.It was observed that the catalyst with NiO after pretreatment was more active than before pretreatment.It is believed that the cocatalyst formed an electron trapper, and the surface became a Schottky barrier to suppress the recombination of electron and holes.The results showed that the photocatalytic reduction was induced by the absorption of visible light. Quantum efficiency is an essential factor to evaluate a photo-excited reaction.Eq. ( 1) is proposed to determine the quantum efficiency.About 6 moles of electrons are required to produce 1 mole of methanol from CO 2 .The energy efficiency evaluates the transformation of the photon energy into chemical energy (Eq.( 2)). The quantum efficiency and energy efficiency were 2.45 and 1.158, respectively, on 1.0 wt. NiO-InTaO 4 R500-O200 catalyst."}, {"title": "Conclusions", "content": "InTaO 4 catalyst was prepared by a solid-state reaction method.NiO was added as a cocatalyst by incipient-wetness impregnation, and then treated by reduction-oxidation process.The XRD patterns of InTaO 4 indicated that it is well crystallized by solid-state reaction at 1100 C.SEM results showed that the particle diameters of InTaO 4 samples were less than 3 lm.After loading NiO on the catalysts, many small particles were observed on the surface.These small particles are NiO as confirmed by EDS.The band gap of InTaO 4 was 2.7 eV.According to the energy potential of CO 2 reduction, these catalysts have ability to reduce CO 2 to methanol under visible light illumination.InTaO 4 with NiO cocatalyst after reduction-oxidation pretreatment always resulted a higher methanol yield than those without pretreatment.1.0 wt. NiO-InTaO 4 R500-O200 in 0.2 M KHCO 3 gave the highest activity (1.394 lmol h A1 g A1 ).The reduction-oxidation pretreatment had a positive effect on the activity of the catalyst, although it is not outstanding.
