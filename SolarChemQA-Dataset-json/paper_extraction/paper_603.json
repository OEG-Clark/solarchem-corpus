Porous-TiO2 was prepared using MIL-125 as a template.In a typical preparation, MIL-125 powder was firstly pyrolyzed in a tube furnace at 500 C for 2 h under argon atmosphere, and the resultant black powder was then calcined in air at 450 C for 2 h to obtain white TiO2 powder. In a typical preparation, 100 mg of porous-TiO2 was mixed with 40 ml of Mg(NO3)2 (99, Sigma-Aldrich) aqueous solution at a certain concentration.The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 24 h and then dried in vacuum at 80 C overnight.The white powder was then collected and calcined at 450 C in air for 2 h.The obtained samples are denoted as xWI, where x indicates the weight percentage of Mg 2 against porous-TiO2 in the recipe. An Ultratech Savannah S200 ALD system was used to coat a MgO overlayer on porous-TiO2.A homemade powder holder loaded with 30 mg of porous-TiO2 powder was placed in the center of ALD chamber, which was maintained at 200 C during the ALD process.Bis(ethylcyclopentadienyl) magnesium Mg(C5H4C2H5)2, min.98, Strem Chemicals Inc. was used as the Mg precursor.In each ALD cycle, \"expo mode\" was used for coating porous materials, and the pulse time of water and Mg precursor was set to 2 s each to introduce adequate amount of reactants to the reaction chamber and ensure even ALD coating on porous-TiO2.After the ALD process, a grey powder was obtained and calcined at 450 C for 30 min to remove any potential organic residues from the ALD process.A white powder was eventually obtained.The ALD samples are denoted as xALD, where x is the number of ALD cycle applied on porous-TiO2. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed on a Bruker-AXS D8 Advance diffractometer using Cu K1 irradiation (1.54059A) at 40 kV and 40 mA at room temperature.The step increment was set at 2 0.05 and the counting time per step was 1s.The morphology, structure were analyzed with a JEOL JSM7500F field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) and a FEI Tecnai G2 F20 ST transmission electron microscope (TEM).UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra were measured on a Hitachi U4100 UV-vis-NIR Spectrophotometer with Praying Mantis accessory.Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area analysis was performed on a Micromeritics ASAP 2420 physisorption analyzer.Prior to surface area measurements, the photocatalyst samples were degassed in vacuum at 100 C for 12 h.X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed on an Omicron XPS system. Photoluminescence spectra (PTI QuantaMaster series Spectrofluorometer) were obtained to investigate the charge recombination emission using 300 nm incident light, scanning from 400 to 600 nm with scan rate 0.1 nm/s.Transient photocurrents of the prepared samples were measured with a Gamry Reference 3000 potentiostat.1.2 mg of sample was loaded on the conductive surface of an ITO glass and a 0.05 M Na2SO4 solution was used as electrolyte.The same 450 W Xe lamp used in CO2 photoreduction test was employed as light source, a 3M Ag/AgCl electrode was used as the reference, and a Pt slice was used as counter electrode. The experimental setup for CO2 photoreduction was similar to that in our previous report 16.A piece of glass fiber filter paper (Pall Corporation) was used as the support for powder photocatalyst.Prior to catalyst loading, the glass fiber paper was calcined in air at 450 C to remove organics on the surface, if any.Then, 10 mg of photocatalyst was dispersed in 2 ml of de-ionized water and sonicated for 10 min. The obtained suspension was dropped onto the glass fiber paper, which was later dried in vacuum oven at 80 C for 30 min.The catalyst-loaded glass fiber paper was then placed into a tubular quartz reactor with photocatalyst side facing the light source.Ultra-high purity CO2 (99.999,Airgas) was bubbled into a water reservoir to generate a CO2/H2O gas mixture (water vapor concentration 2.3 by volume) before purged into the tube reactor.Before turning the light on, the system was flushed at a CO2 flow rate of 298.0 standard cubic centimeter per minute (sccm) for 1 h and then maintained at 3.0 sccm.Light source used in this study was a 450 W Xe lamp (Newport, Inc.) equipped with a water filter to diminish infrared irradiation, the distance between the Xe lamp and the photocatalyst was 30 cm.The light spectrum of the S1.The outlet of the reactor was connected with a Shimadzu GC-2014ATF gas chromatograph, which was equipped with an autosampler, a thermal conductivity detector (TCD, to detect H2, O2, and CO2 when applicable), and a flame ionization detector (FID) coupled with a methanizer (to detect CO and CH4 when applicable). Figure S2 shows the XRD pattern of as synthesized MIL-125 powder, which is a titanium based MOF and used as the precursor of porous-TiO2.The sharp peaks in the XRD pattern comfirm high crystallinity of the as prepared MIL-125 sample, which also agree with with the XRD patterns of MIL-125 reported in the literture 42.SEM image of as prepared MIL-125 (Figure S3) illustrates the well defined dish-like shape of the sample. The XRD patterns of all prepared photocatalyst are shown in Figure 1.It was found that all sampels are consist of both anatase and rutile phases.The existence of rutile phase is possibly a result of anatase to rutile phase change induced by elevated pyrolysis temperature in porous-TiO2 preparation.Weight ratio of anatase/rutile was calculated by Rietveld refinement method 43.Phase composition and crystallite size of anatase and rutile in the three representative samples are listed in Table 1.The prepared samples show a comparable phase composition made of anatase and rutile.WI and ALD samples had a slightly higher rutile phase and a slightly larger rutile crystallite size than porous-TiO2, probably due to the extended thermal treatment processes undergone on those samples.For most samples, diffraction peaks for MgO were not found, likely due to the small weight percentage of MgO and its good disperson on porous-TiO2.The exception is 100ALD, where the existence of MgO was comfirmed by the characteristic peak of MgO at 2 42.9.With 100 layers of MgO addition, the MgO loading amount was considerably higher than other samples and detectable by XRD. The morphologies of porous-TiO2, 2WI and 5ALD are shown in SEM images in Figure 2. porous-TiO2 particles exhibit a cubic shape with an average particle size of 270 nm (Figure 2a).Compared with porous-TiO2, 2WI (Figure 2d) and 5ALD (Figure 2g) have a similar particle size, but the surface of 2WI sample has a considerable level of roughness and irregular agglormeration of ultrafine particles.In the preparation procedure of WI samples, Mg(NO3)2 was firstly crystalized on the surface of porous-TiO2 nanoparticles after the evaporation of Mg(NO3)2 solution.The surface Mg(NO3)2 deposition was then converted to MgO nanoparticles during the subsequent calcination process, which likely resulted in the elevated surface roughness and irregularity 41,44.In contrast, 5ALD (Figure 2g) has a smooth surface similar to porous-TiO2, in coincident with the morphology of coating .In addition, shown in Figure 2g, the SEM image is blurry, which is likely due to the reduced surface conductivity of the photocatalyst caused by the MgO overlayer.Since MgO is an insulator, the reduction in conductivity indicates successful coating of MgO overlayer on the porous-TiO2.TEM analyses were performed on porous-TiO2, 2WI and 5ALD to further investigate the morphology and crystal structure of the photocatalysts (Figures 2b,c,e,f,h,i).As shown in Figure 2b, porous-TiO2 particles have an average size of 270 nm, consisting of firmly interconnected ultrafine nanoparticles, with distinct pore structure.Similar morphology was observed for 5ALD and 2WI.However, 2WI exhibited a relatively loosened nanoparticle packing, compared to porous-TiO2 and 5ALD, which coincides with the relatively higher surface roughness observed in the 2WI SEM image.As displayed in Figure 2c, 2f, 2i, both anatase phase (d 0.352 nm) and rutile phase (d 0.323 nm) were found on porous-TiO2, 2WI, and 5ALD samples, agreeing with the XRD results.However, due to the low amount of MgO addition on 2WI and 5ALD samples, characteristic lattice of MgO was not observed.TEM analysis on 100ALD was also performed to probe the morphology and crystal structure of MgO at a higher loading level (Figure S4).A lattice spacing at d 0.21 nm was identified that corresponds to crystalline MgO.This result also agrees with the XRD data of 100ALD sample (Figure 1n), where MgO diffraction peak was seen.Interestingly, instead of being a uniform overcoating layer, the ALD added MgO was found in the form of nanoparticle deposition on 100ALD.As mentioned in the catalyst preparation section, all ALD prepared samples were calcined in air at 450 C after ALD treatment to eliminate any potential organic residue from ALD process.Thus, it is highly likely that MgO as thick as 100 ALD layers sintered during the calcination process and turned into fine nanoparticles deposited on the surface of the photocatalyst.Nonetheless, for 5ALD sample, as the ALD coated layer was ultrathin, sintering effect of MgO was not observed (Figure 2c, f, i). In order to evaluate porosity of as prepared photocatalysts in this study, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis was performed.The of N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of porous-TiO2, 2WI and 5ALD are printed in Figure 3.All of the three samples exhibit type III isotherms, indicating weak gas-solid interaction on the surface of photocatalysts 45.Porous-TiO2 display a type H2 hysteresis loop, demonstrating disordered pore size and shape.On the other hand, 2WI and 5ALD samples show type H3 hysteresis loops, meaning slit-shaped pore shape 45.It is likely that the added ALD-MgO layer stuffed on pore channels of porous-TiO2 and narrowed the pore size.In Table 2, BET surface area and pore size of selected photocatalysts are listed. BET surface area of porous-TiO2 was measured to be 47.6 m 2 /g, which is less than the value reported in the literature 23,24.This likely is because a higher calcination temperature was used in this work to ensure removal of potential carbon residues from the synthesis process, which on the other hand sintered the porous-TiO2 porous structure.Nevertheless, porous-TiO2 still exhibited comparable surface area to commercial P25 nanopowder (50 m 2 /g).With addition of MgO, samples prepared by both WI and ALD methods showed increase in surface area at a very low MgO concentration (0.1) or 1 ALD cycle MgO coating.It is possible that the addition of a trace amount of MgO or an ALD overlayer caused increased surface roughness at a length scale smaller than the crystal size of porous-TiO2, thus increasing the surface area.While with a higher amount of MgO incorporation, pore channels in TiO2 became stuffed with larger size MgO, leading to a decrease in surface area.The 10WI sample had similar surface area to those of 2WI sample and porous-TiO2, indicating the morphology and nanostructure of MgO are similar to that of TiO2.For the ALD samples, the surface area decreased more dramatically with the number of ALD cycles, and the 100ALD sample had a lower surface area than porous-TiO2, possibly because the porous structure of porous-TiO2 was smoothened by the denser ALD overlayer. Pore size distributions of porous-TiO2, 2WI and 5ALD are also plotted in Figure 3based on BJH desorption data.Average pore sizes are listed in Table 2.A sharp peak centered at 5.7 nm was observed for porous-TiO2, and the measured pores were likely a result of the spaces between the primary nanocrystals as observed from the TEM images in Figure 2. Compared with porous-TiO2, pores on of 2WI expanded significantly, centered at 10 nm, ranging from 3.5 nm to 30 nm.All WI prepared samples showed expanded pore size, or larger inter-crystal spaces, which agrees with the TEM analysis in Figure 2 that 2WI sample exhibited a loosened particle packing compared with porous-TiO2.Similar to porous-TiO2, 5ALD shows a sharp pore size distribution, but the peak slightly shifts towards lower pore size, centering at 4.2 nm.For all three ALD prepared samples listed in Table 2, shrink in pore size was observed, which is reasonable because the ALD layer decreases the space in between the TiO2 crystals. To determine the chemical composition of prepared samples, EDS elemental mapping analysis was performed.Mg element was not detected on 2WI and 5ALD from EDS mapping analysis, which is likely due to the very low amount of MgO.Thus, porous-TiO2, 10WI and 100ALD were used as representative samples in the EDS analysis, and the results are displayed in Figure S6.As revealed by the EDS mapping, Ti was evenly distributed on all of the three samples; Mg was not detected on porous-TiO2, but was uniformly dispersed on 10WI and 100ALD, confirming successful deposition of MgO on the surface of 10WI and 100ALD. Surface chemical states of representative samples were analyzed with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).XPS survey of porous-TiO2, 2WI and 5ALD samples can be found in Figure S7.To confirm the presence of surface Mg, analysis on Mg 2p peak was conducted.However, due to the low concentration of Mg and detection limit of the XPS instrument, Mg 2p peak was only found on samples with higher It has been reported that addition of MgO enables alternation of surface states on TiO2 and promotes generation of defects such as Ti 3 and oxygen vacancy 41.Ti 3 has been reported to improve the light absorption of TiO2, hinder electron-hole recombination and improve photoactivity 7,46.In addition, oxygen vacancies may serve as active sites in CO2 photocatalytic reduction process 7,16.However, oxygen vacancies are unstable and have a tendency to react with surface absorbed water and form surface hydroxyl groups (-OH), which also is another reactive species in CO2 photoreduction by enhancing CO2 adsorption and conversion 47.Therefore, XPS was applied to study the chemical states of Ti (Ti 3 and Ti 4 ) and O (surface hydroxyl bonded with Mg (Mg-OH) or Ti (Ti-OH) and lattice oxygen bonded with Mg (Mg-O) or Ti (Ti-O)), by analyzing Ti 2p and O 1s peaks.The Ti 2p peaks in the photocatalyst are located at binding energies 458.7 eV (Ti 4 2p3/2), 464.6 eV (Ti 4 2p1/2), 457.7 eV (Ti 3 2p3/2), and 463.4 eV (Ti 3 2p1/2); while O 1s peaks are located at binding energies 532.6 eV (Mg-OH), 530.5 eV (Mg-O), 531.9 eV (Ti-OH) and 529.9 eV (Ti-O) 41,48,49. Deconvolution analyses of Ti 2p spectra for porous-TiO2, 2WI and 5ALD are shown in Figure 5. Surface Ti 4 and Ti 3 contents of selected samples are listed in Table 3.The surface of porous-TiO2 is of 100 Ti 4 due to the process of calcination in air at a high temperature.On the surface of WI samples, a small fraction of Ti 3 was detected, and it increased with MgO concentration and became saturated at about 6.7 Ti 3 for 10WI.As previously reported 41, introduction of MgO on surface of TiO2 results in generation of surface Ti 3 , due to the interaction of Mg with surface TiO2.For ALD coated samples, 5.4 of Ti 3 was detected with the addition of 1 layer of ALD coating, while it drastically increased to 12.0 and 30.3 for samples with 2 and 5 ALD layers, respectively.This result clearly demonstrates a more significant impact of ALD coating than wet impregnation on the alternation of surface chemical states.For samples with 20 and 100 ALD layers, Ti peaks were hardly distinguishable from noises (Figure S9) and thus were considered non-detectable.This is reasonable given the thicker coating of MgO masked X-ray exposure to the TiO2 and XPS is sensitive only to a depth of a couple of nanometers on the surface.By comparing the Ti 3 percentage on the WI and ALD samples, it is clear that the extent of Mg species in generating/altering Ti surface states depends more on MgO coverage (by ALD) than on MgO loading amount (by WI). Deconvolution analyses of O 1s spectra for porous-TiO2 and 2WI and 5ALD are displayed in Figure 6. The percentages of Ti-OH, Ti-O, Mg-OH and Mg-O based on the O 1s analyses are calculated and listed in Table 3.On the surface of porous-TiO2 sample, Ti-OH accounts for 5.9 of the surface species while the rest are Ti-O.The generation of small amount of surface OH groups is likely due to the adsorption of moisture from air.For WI samples, the percentages of surface Mg-OH and Mg-O have a positive correlation with MgO content in the range from 0.1 to 2 of MgO, while the percentages of total Ti coverage decreases, indicating an increased MgO surface coverage.From WI samples with larger than 2 MgO content, it is observed that the percentages of Mg-OH and Mg-O as well as those of Ti-OH and Ti-O remain relatively constant.This implies that the MgO coverage on the WI catalyst surface reached a maximum value at around 2 MgO and further increasing the MgO content only caused aggregation of MgO particles rather than extending the coverage on the catalyst.For the ALD samples, the percentages of Mg-OH and Mg-O increased with the number of ALD layers in the range from 1 to 100 layers, while the Ti coverage decreased accordingly.When the number of ALD layers was more than 20, the catalyst surface was covered by almost all Mg species with minimal exposure of Ti species.These results again reveal the more significant impact on the surface coverage by the ALD method than by the WI method. As shown in Figure 7. under UV-vis irradiation, the photocurrent density of porous-TiO2 was measured to be 2.0 A/cm 2 .With surface modification of MgO, the transient photocurrent density of 2WI and 5ALD improved to 6.9 and 4.8 A/cm 2 , respectively, about 3.3 or 2.3 times as high as than that of porous-TiO2.This result suggests the MgO modification improved photo-induced charge separation and transfer to the surface.The lower photocurrent generated on5ALD than on 2WI might be attributed to the more uniformly distributed MgO on the TiO2 surface that adds more resistance to charge transfer. The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra and band gap analyses are presented in Figure S10.The band gap of porous-TiO2 is measured at 3.0 eV, smaller than that of P25 (3.2 eV).The higher rutile phase percentage in porous-TiO2 (56.1 rutile in porous-TiO2 vs. 15 rutile in P25 50) is possibly responsible for the reduced band gap width.With addition of MgO species, no significant change in band gap and light absorption capacity was observed for both WI and ALD prepared samples, compared with that of porous-TiO2.The band gap variated from 3.0-3.1 eV for WI samples.For ALD samples, the band gap of all samples except 100ALD was measured to be 3.0 eV; while 100ALD showed a slightly enlarged band gap value of 3.2 eV.It is possible that a thicker layer of MgO such as 100ALD may have changed the surface To understand the surface electron-hole recombination characteristic of the prepared samples, photoluminescence spectra were measured.Since photoluminescence spectra record light emission generated by electron-hole recombination, quenched photoluminescence intensity indicates improved charge separation.As shown in Figure 8, among the tested samples, porous-TiO2 displayed the highest light emission, suggesting the largest surface recombination effect.Among WI samples, surface chargehole recombination was suppressed with only 0.1 of MgO addition, and 2WI showed even weaker surface recombination effect.Reduction in photoluminescence suggests surface MgO played a key role in surface charge-hole separation.However, 10WI showed higher photoluminescence than 0.1WI, which suggests that excess MgO content on porous-TiO2 surface might form recombination centers.For ALD prepared samples, with only 1 layer of MgO overcoating, the photoluminescence was significantly reduced compared with porous-TiO2, the reduction in photoluminescence did not change much with more added ALD layers.Overall, the ALD samples showed lower photoluminescence intensity that the WI samples.This is likely due to the surface state passivation effect of ALD overcoating that hehp to reduce surface recombination.This mechanism was reported in our previously published work on CO2 photoreduction by TiO2 nanorods coated with an Al2O3 overlayer by ALD method 16. The CO2 photoreduction tests were conducted with continuous flow of CO2 and water vapor under UVvis irradiation.The performances of WI and ALD samples in terms of CO production in comparison with 9 was indeed derived from CO2 reduction by the photocatalyst.In this study, CO was found to be the major product, while trace CH4 production was found only on 2ALD, 5ALD and 10 ALD samples. No H2 production was detected.Thus, only CO production was given and compared among the various catalysts.Commercially available P25 was used as a reference to demonstrate the improved performance of pristine and MgO modified porous-TiO2.The CO produced by porous-TiO2 (12.7 mol/g) was 5.1-fold higher than that of P25 (2.5 mol/g).Since porous-TiO2 and P25 exhibited similar surface area (47.6 m 2 /g for porous-TiO2 vs. 50 m 2 /g for P25), the enhanced CO2 photoreduction performance was attributed to the following two factors: (a) the porous hierarchical structure of porous-TiO2; (b) the higher rutile to anatase ratio.The porous structure of porous-TiO2 allows favorable intraparticle gas diffusion and facilitates gas diffusion and reactant-product exchange with the bulk, leading to relatively high reactant and low product concentrations around the surface of photocatalyst.In addition, according to previous reports 515253, a phase weight ratio of 50-60 rutile in anatase/rutile mixed TiO2 presents highly improved photocatalytic performance compared with TiO2 with a higher anatase content.It is possible that the proper rutile percentage in porous-TiO2 (56) contributes to the improved performance in CO2 photocatalytic reduction performance of porous-TiO2 compared to P25. With the modification of MgO, all WI samples and ALD samples displayed enhancement in photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance.Due to the alkaline earth oxide nature of MgO, it is prone to generate surface hydroxyl even with the presence of trace amount of water vapor.The surface hydroxyl groups on MgO have higher basicity than those on TiO2 that are slightly acidic 54.For WI samples, the CO2 photoreduction performance improved with MgO addition amount from 0.1 to 2.Among all WI samples, the 2WI sample presented the best photoreduction performance, 40.5 mol/g, which is 3.2 times higher than porous-TiO2 and 16.2 times higher than P25.The improvement of 2WI compared with porous-TiO2 is attributed to favorable properties originated from the MgO modification such as surface Ti 3 species and Mg-OH groups as seen in Table 3.However, too much amount of MgO addition on photocatalyst surface can reduce the contact of CO2 molecule with TiO2.In addition, the CO production is normalized by the total mass of TiO2 and MgO, while TiO2 is the only photo-active material.Increasing the MgO content above 5 wt. did not increase the Ti 3 and Mg-OH significantly (Table 3) but reduced the amount of active TiO2 content.As can be seen in Figure 9a, with MgO percentage higher than 2, CO2 photoreduction performance started to drop. The performance of CO2 photoreduction by ALD samples are shown in Figure 9b.The addition of a single atomic layer of MgO doubled the amount of CO production compared with pristine porous-TiO2.The CO2 photoreduction performance increased with the number of ALD layer from 1 to 5 layers and then decreased with more than 5 layers.The 5ALD sample was the optimum one among all ALD samples, producing 54.0 mol/g CO, which was 4.3 times higher than porous-TiO2 and 21.3 times higher than P25.With 30.3 surface Ti 3 concentration, 2.2 Mg-OH and 41.8 MgO concentration, it is reasonable that the 5ALD sample performed significantly better than porous-TiO2, which had none of the above active species However, similar to WI samples, ALD samples with too \"thick\" a MgO overlayer (5 layers) experienced a decrease in CO2 photoreduction performance.The decline in CO production can be attributed to the following reasons: (1) a decrease in surface area is observed with too many ALD layers, as seen in Table 2, which hinders the transport and adsorption of CO2 in the porous TiO2; and (2) an increase in the thickness of ALD overlayer increases the resistance for photoexcited electrons and holes to transfer to the surface of photocatalyst to initiate CO2 reduction process.However, for catalysts with relatively \"thick\" layers such as 50ALD and 100ALD, the catalytic performance was not inferior to that of porous-TiO2 thanks to the surface passivation effect of ALD layers that prevent surface charge recombination 16. By comparing the photocurrent density data and CO2 photoreduction performance of 2WI and 5ALD, it was noticed that 2WI showed higher photocurrent density but showed worse photocatalytic CO2 performance compared to 5ALD.According to previously discussed, the major difference between 2WI and 5ALD is the MgO morphology.Due to the nature of WI method, MgO are deposited on 2WI as ultrafine nanoparticles, while MgO layer is more uniformly distributed on 5ALD.The difference in MgO morphology results variations in surface interaction with CO2 molecules and thus affect CO2 adsorption. The inconsistency in photocurrent density and overall CO2 photoreduction performance and the difference in MgO morphology suggests better affinity of CO2 with 5ALD over 2WI.Because of high coverage on photocatalysts, 5ALD has more surface area to serve as absorbent to CO2 molecules, as a result, photoexcited electrons can be more easily transferred to CO2 molecules and thus the overall performance is improved. In order to further demonstrate that porous-TiO2 as a better candidate for photocatalytic CO2 reduction applications over commercial P25, MgO modified P25 was prepared with 5 layers of MgO coating (denoted as 5ALD-P25) and 2 MgO of wet impregnation (denoted as 2WI-P25).It was found that 2WI-P25 produced 11.8 mol/g of CO (equivalent to 29.1 of that produced by 2WI-porous-TiO2), 5ALD-P25 sample produced 15.5 mol/g of CO (equivalent to 28.7 of that produced by 5ALD-porous- Combining the result that P25 produced only 2.5 mol/g of CO (equivalent to 19.2 of that produced by porous-TiO2), it is apparent that porous-TiO2 is advantageous over P25 no matter with or without MgO modification To investigate the effect of coating materials on the catalytic activity, we have conducted another experiment using ALD to coat 5 layers of Al2O3 on porous-TiO2.The sample is denoted as 5ALD(Al2O3), and its catalytic activity is compared with that by 5ALD(MgO).The 5ALD(Al2O3) sample produced 19.2 mol/g of CO, which is higher than the pristine porous-TiO2 (12.7 mol/g) but much lower than 5ALD(MgO) (54.0 mol/g) as shown in Figure 9.According to our previous report 16, an Al2O3ALD overlayer on TiO2 exhibits surface state preservation effect and thus promotes CO2 photoreduction performance.This conclusion is once again confirmed in this work by comparing 5ALD(Al2O3) with porous-TiO2.The difference in catalytic activity between 5ALD(Al2O3) and 5ALD(MgO) suggests that, in addition to surface state preservation effect, the MgO layer may promote adsorption of CO2 due to a higher surface basicity.Because of the extremely trace amount of ALD coated MgO present on the surface, it was not possible to differentiate the equilibrium CO2 adsorption capacity on the MgO-coated and Al2O3coated or non-coated samples.Given that the 2WI sample had 40.5 mol/g CO production that is still much higher than the 5ALD(Al2O3) sample, it is likely the surface CO2 adsorption enhancement due to MgO is one of the main reasons for the promoted CO2 photoreduction activity, as also evidenced in our previous studies. 22, 23 By comparing the best-performing ALD sample (5ALD) with the best-performing WI sample (2WI), one can see that the performance of 5ALD in CO production was 28 better than that of 2WI.The phase composition, surface area, crystal size, and band gap of 5ALD and 2WI were similar (Table 2). The surface Mg atomic concentrations of the two samples were also very close (Table 3).The most extinct difference of the two materials is the surface Ti 3 concentration (30.3 on 5ALD and 2.6 on 2WI), which may account for the better performance of 5ALD than 2WI.This is because Ti 3 is usually paired with oxygen vacancies and those defect sites play a crucial role in facilitating charge transfer and separation as well as CO2/H2O adsorption and dissociation on the catalyst surface 7,18,46,55. With regard to the CO2 photoreduction mechanism, it has been widely reported in the literature 565758 that the formation of CO and CH4 follows the two-and eight-electron reduction processes, respectively. It is reasonable that CO is found to be the major product in this work because much fewer electrons are needed to form CO than to form CH4. (1) Moreover, the surface oxygen vacancy/Ti 3 species is believed to improve CO2 adsorption and activation on the surface, according to the following reactions, where CO2 -, HCO3 -, and CO3 -species could be intermediate species for CO2 reduction (Spontaneous dissociation of CO2 to CO on defective surface of Cu (I)/TiO2-x nanoparticles at room temperature 59. In this work, MgO modified on the TiO2 surface, especially ALD-coated MgO significantly increased the surface Ti 3 and OH species, and thus contributed to the production of CO2 reduction intermediates as shown in Reactions (3)(4)(5).However, it is still not clear exactly how the MgO distribution and morphology affect the reaction pathways.This will be the direction of our future work. This work for the first time applied ALD to effectively coat a thin, uniform layer of MgO on a MOFderived porous TiO2 photocatalyst and demonstrated significantly promoted CO2 photoreduction performance, which was more than 4 times and 18 times higher than those of porous TiO2 and commercial P25, respectively.A conventional wet-impregnation (WI) method was also applied to incorporate MgO on porous TiO2 to compare against the ALD method.MgO modified catalysts prepared by both methods showed enhancement in CO production because of the added surface basicity to enhance CO2 adsorption and the introduction of defect sites such as Ti 3 to promote electron-hole transfer.The ALD samples were advantageous over WI samples due to the generation of higher concentration of surface Ti 3 and the surface passivation effect of ALD coating that inhibits surface recombination.Material property analysis and photocatalytic activity results showed that ALD method is likely a better way for compared with conventional WI method with higher surface Ti 3 concentration, ALD coating surface state preservation effects as well as lower charge/hole recombination effects.The application of ALD as an enabling technique of surface modification to enhance catalytic performance successfully demonstrated in this work may be extended to catalysts beyond TiO2 and to catalytic reactions beyond CO2 reduction. lamp measured 30 cm away from the lamp is shown in Figure S1 (Supporting Information).Intensity of UV, visible, IR light of the Xe lamp measured with/without the quartz tube is listed in Table amounts of Mg addition.Mg 2p XPS spectra of 100ALD and 10WI are printed in FigureS8.Mg 2p peaks found at 50 eV confirm the existence of Mg element on both of the photocatalysts. optical property.Overall, neither WI nor ALD modification caused significant changes in the optical properties of porous-TiO2. photocatalysts in the dark; (c) Ar H2O with photocatalysts under UV-vis irradiation.No carbon Figure9was indeed derived from CO2 reduction by the photocatalyst.In this study, CO was found to be Figure 1.XRD patterns of (a) porous-TiO2, (b) 0.1WI, (c) 0.5WI, (d) 1WI, (e) 2WI, (f) 5WI, Figure 2.

The XRD patterns of all prepared photocatalyst are shown in Figure 1.It was found that all sampels are consist of both anatase and rutile phases.The existence of rutile phase is possibly a result of anatase to rutile phase change induced by elevated pyrolysis temperature in porous-TiO2 preparation.Weight ratio of anatase/rutile was calculated by Rietveld refinement method 43.Phase composition and crystallite size of anatase and rutile in the three representative samples are listed in Table 1.The prepared samples show a comparable phase composition made of anatase and rutile.WI and ALD samples had a slightly higher rutile phase and a slightly larger rutile crystallite size than porous-TiO2, probably due to the extended thermal treatment processes undergone on those samples.For most samples, diffraction peaks for MgO were not found, likely due to the small weight percentage of MgO and its good disperson on porous-TiO2.The exception is 100ALD, where the existence of MgO was comfirmed by the characteristic peak of MgO at 2 42.9.With 100 layers of MgO addition, the MgO loading amount was considerably higher than other samples and detectable by XRD. The morphologies of porous-TiO2, 2WI and 5ALD are shown in SEM images in Figure 2. porous-TiO2 particles exhibit a cubic shape with an average particle size of 270 nm (Figure 2a).Compared with porous-TiO2, 2WI (Figure 2d) and 5ALD (Figure 2g) have a similar particle size, but the surface of 2WI sample has a considerable level of roughness and irregular agglormeration of ultrafine particles.In the preparation procedure of WI samples, Mg(NO3)2 was firstly crystalized on the surface of porous-TiO2 nanoparticles after the evaporation of Mg(NO3)2 solution.The surface Mg(NO3)2 deposition was then converted to MgO nanoparticles during the subsequent calcination process, which likely resulted in the elevated surface roughness and irregularity 41,44.In contrast, 5ALD (Figure 2g) has a smooth surface similar to porous-TiO2, in coincident with the morphology of coating .In addition, shown in Figure 2g, the SEM image is blurry, which is likely due to the reduced surface conductivity of the photocatalyst caused by the MgO overlayer.Since MgO is an insulator, the reduction in conductivity indicates successful coating of MgO overlayer on the porous-TiO2.TEM analyses were performed on porous-TiO2, 2WI and 5ALD to further investigate the morphology and crystal structure of the photocatalysts (Figures 2b,c,e,f,h,i).As shown in Figure 2b, porous-TiO2 particles have an average size of 270 nm, consisting of firmly interconnected ultrafine nanoparticles, with distinct pore structure.Similar morphology was observed for 5ALD and 2WI.However, 2WI exhibited a relatively loosened nanoparticle packing, compared to porous-TiO2 and 5ALD, which coincides with the relatively higher surface roughness observed in the 2WI SEM image.As displayed in Figure 2c, 2f, 2i, both anatase phase (d 0.352 nm) and rutile phase (d 0.323 nm) were found on porous-TiO2, 2WI, and 5ALD samples, agreeing with the XRD results.However, due to the low amount of MgO addition on 2WI and 5ALD samples, characteristic lattice of MgO was not observed.TEM analysis on 100ALD was also performed to probe the morphology and crystal structure of MgO at a higher loading level (Figure S4).A lattice spacing at d 0.21 nm was identified that corresponds to crystalline MgO.This result also agrees with the XRD data of 100ALD sample (Figure 1n), where MgO diffraction peak was seen.Interestingly, instead of being a uniform overcoating layer, the ALD added MgO was found in the form of nanoparticle deposition on 100ALD.As mentioned in the catalyst preparation section, all ALD prepared samples were calcined in air at 450 C after ALD treatment to eliminate any potential organic residue from ALD process.Thus, it is highly likely that MgO as thick as 100 ALD layers sintered during the calcination process and turned into fine nanoparticles deposited on the surface of the photocatalyst.Nonetheless, for 5ALD sample, as the ALD coated layer was ultrathin, sintering effect of MgO was not observed (Figure 2c, f, i). In order to evaluate porosity of as prepared photocatalysts in this study, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis was performed.The of N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of porous-TiO2, 2WI and 5ALD are printed in Figure 3.All of the three samples exhibit type III isotherms, indicating weak gas-solid interaction on the surface of photocatalysts 45.Porous-TiO2 display a type H2 hysteresis loop, demonstrating disordered pore size and shape.On the other hand, 2WI and 5ALD samples show type H3 hysteresis loops, meaning slit-shaped pore shape 45.It is likely that the added ALD-MgO layer stuffed on pore channels of porous-TiO2 and narrowed the pore size.In Table 2, BET surface area and pore size of selected photocatalysts are listed. BET surface area of porous-TiO2 was measured to be 47.6 m 2 /g, which is less than the value reported in the literature 23,24.This likely is because a higher calcination temperature was used in this work to ensure removal of potential carbon residues from the synthesis process, which on the other hand sintered the porous-TiO2 porous structure.Nevertheless, porous-TiO2 still exhibited comparable surface area to commercial P25 nanopowder (50 m 2 /g).With addition of MgO, samples prepared by both WI and ALD methods showed increase in surface area at a very low MgO concentration (0.1) or 1 ALD cycle MgO coating.It is possible that the addition of a trace amount of MgO or an ALD overlayer caused increased surface roughness at a length scale smaller than the crystal size of porous-TiO2, thus increasing the surface area.While with a higher amount of MgO incorporation, pore channels in TiO2 became stuffed with larger size MgO, leading to a decrease in surface area.The 10WI sample had similar surface area to those of 2WI sample and porous-TiO2, indicating the morphology and nanostructure of MgO are similar to that of TiO2.For the ALD samples, the surface area decreased more dramatically with the number of ALD cycles, and the 100ALD sample had a lower surface area than porous-TiO2, possibly because the porous structure of porous-TiO2 was smoothened by the denser ALD overlayer. Pore size distributions of porous-TiO2, 2WI and 5ALD are also plotted in Figure 3based on BJH desorption data.Average pore sizes are listed in Table 2.A sharp peak centered at 5.7 nm was observed for porous-TiO2, and the measured pores were likely a result of the spaces between the primary nanocrystals as observed from the TEM images in Figure 2. Compared with porous-TiO2, pores on of 2WI expanded significantly, centered at 10 nm, ranging from 3.5 nm to 30 nm.All WI prepared samples showed expanded pore size, or larger inter-crystal spaces, which agrees with the TEM analysis in Figure 2 that 2WI sample exhibited a loosened particle packing compared with porous-TiO2.Similar to porous-TiO2, 5ALD shows a sharp pore size distribution, but the peak slightly shifts towards lower pore size, centering at 4.2 nm.For all three ALD prepared samples listed in Table 2, shrink in pore size was observed, which is reasonable because the ALD layer decreases the space in between the TiO2 crystals. To determine the chemical composition of prepared samples, EDS elemental mapping analysis was performed.Mg element was not detected on 2WI and 5ALD from EDS mapping analysis, which is likely due to the very low amount of MgO.Thus, porous-TiO2, 10WI and 100ALD were used as representative samples in the EDS analysis, and the results are displayed in Figure S6.As revealed by the EDS mapping, Ti was evenly distributed on all of the three samples; Mg was not detected on porous-TiO2, but was uniformly dispersed on 10WI and 100ALD, confirming successful deposition of MgO on the surface of 10WI and 100ALD. Surface chemical states of representative samples were analyzed with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).XPS survey of porous-TiO2, 2WI and 5ALD samples can be found in Figure S7.To confirm the presence of surface Mg, analysis on Mg 2p peak was conducted.However, due to the low concentration of Mg and detection limit of the XPS instrument, Mg 2p peak was only found on samples with higher It has been reported that addition of MgO enables alternation of surface states on TiO2 and promotes generation of defects such as Ti 3 and oxygen vacancy 41.Ti 3 has been reported to improve the light absorption of TiO2, hinder electron-hole recombination and improve photoactivity 7,46.In addition, oxygen vacancies may serve as active sites in CO2 photocatalytic reduction process 7,16.However, oxygen vacancies are unstable and have a tendency to react with surface absorbed water and form surface hydroxyl groups (-OH), which also is another reactive species in CO2 photoreduction by enhancing CO2 adsorption and conversion 47.Therefore, XPS was applied to study the chemical states of Ti (Ti 3 and Ti 4 ) and O (surface hydroxyl bonded with Mg (Mg-OH) or Ti (Ti-OH) and lattice oxygen bonded with Mg (Mg-O) or Ti (Ti-O)), by analyzing Ti 2p and O 1s peaks.The Ti 2p peaks in the photocatalyst are located at binding energies 458.7 eV (Ti 4 2p3/2), 464.6 eV (Ti 4 2p1/2), 457.7 eV (Ti 3 2p3/2), and 463.4 eV (Ti 3 2p1/2); while O 1s peaks are located at binding energies 532.6 eV (Mg-OH), 530.5 eV (Mg-O), 531.9 eV (Ti-OH) and 529.9 eV (Ti-O) 41,48,49. Deconvolution analyses of Ti 2p spectra for porous-TiO2, 2WI and 5ALD are shown in Figure 5. Surface Ti 4 and Ti 3 contents of selected samples are listed in Table 3.The surface of porous-TiO2 is of 100 Ti 4 due to the process of calcination in air at a high temperature.On the surface of WI samples, a small fraction of Ti 3 was detected, and it increased with MgO concentration and became saturated at about 6.7 Ti 3 for 10WI.As previously reported 41, introduction of MgO on surface of TiO2 results in generation of surface Ti 3 , due to the interaction of Mg with surface TiO2.For ALD coated samples, 5.4 of Ti 3 was detected with the addition of 1 layer of ALD coating, while it drastically increased to 12.0 and 30.3 for samples with 2 and 5 ALD layers, respectively.This result clearly demonstrates a more significant impact of ALD coating than wet impregnation on the alternation of surface chemical states.For samples with 20 and 100 ALD layers, Ti peaks were hardly distinguishable from noises (Figure S9) and thus were considered non-detectable.This is reasonable given the thicker coating of MgO masked X-ray exposure to the TiO2 and XPS is sensitive only to a depth of a couple of nanometers on the surface.By comparing the Ti 3 percentage on the WI and ALD samples, it is clear that the extent of Mg species in generating/altering Ti surface states depends more on MgO coverage (by ALD) than on MgO loading amount (by WI). Deconvolution analyses of O 1s spectra for porous-TiO2 and 2WI and 5ALD are displayed in Figure 6. The percentages of Ti-OH, Ti-O, Mg-OH and Mg-O based on the O 1s analyses are calculated and listed in Table 3.On the surface of porous-TiO2 sample, Ti-OH accounts for 5.9 of the surface species while the rest are Ti-O.The generation of small amount of surface OH groups is likely due to the adsorption of moisture from air.For WI samples, the percentages of surface Mg-OH and Mg-O have a positive correlation with MgO content in the range from 0.1 to 2 of MgO, while the percentages of total Ti coverage decreases, indicating an increased MgO surface coverage.From WI samples with larger than 2 MgO content, it is observed that the percentages of Mg-OH and Mg-O as well as those of Ti-OH and Ti-O remain relatively constant.This implies that the MgO coverage on the WI catalyst surface reached a maximum value at around 2 MgO and further increasing the MgO content only caused aggregation of MgO particles rather than extending the coverage on the catalyst.For the ALD samples, the percentages of Mg-OH and Mg-O increased with the number of ALD layers in the range from 1 to 100 layers, while the Ti coverage decreased accordingly.When the number of ALD layers was more than 20, the catalyst surface was covered by almost all Mg species with minimal exposure of Ti species.These results again reveal the more significant impact on the surface coverage by the ALD method than by the WI method. As shown in Figure 7. under UV-vis irradiation, the photocurrent density of porous-TiO2 was measured to be 2.0 A/cm 2 .With surface modification of MgO, the transient photocurrent density of 2WI and 5ALD improved to 6.9 and 4.8 A/cm 2 , respectively, about 3.3 or 2.3 times as high as than that of porous-TiO2.This result suggests the MgO modification improved photo-induced charge separation and transfer to the surface.The lower photocurrent generated on5ALD than on 2WI might be attributed to the more uniformly distributed MgO on the TiO2 surface that adds more resistance to charge transfer. The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra and band gap analyses are presented in Figure S10.The band gap of porous-TiO2 is measured at 3.0 eV, smaller than that of P25 (3.2 eV).The higher rutile phase percentage in porous-TiO2 (56.1 rutile in porous-TiO2 vs. 15 rutile in P25 50) is possibly responsible for the reduced band gap width.With addition of MgO species, no significant change in band gap and light absorption capacity was observed for both WI and ALD prepared samples, compared with that of porous-TiO2.The band gap variated from 3.0-3.1 eV for WI samples.For ALD samples, the band gap of all samples except 100ALD was measured to be 3.0 eV; while 100ALD showed a slightly enlarged band gap value of 3.2 eV.It is possible that a thicker layer of MgO such as 100ALD may have changed the surface To understand the surface electron-hole recombination characteristic of the prepared samples, photoluminescence spectra were measured.Since photoluminescence spectra record light emission generated by electron-hole recombination, quenched photoluminescence intensity indicates improved charge separation.As shown in Figure 8, among the tested samples, porous-TiO2 displayed the highest light emission, suggesting the largest surface recombination effect.Among WI samples, surface chargehole recombination was suppressed with only 0.1 of MgO addition, and 2WI showed even weaker surface recombination effect.Reduction in photoluminescence suggests surface MgO played a key role in surface charge-hole separation.However, 10WI showed higher photoluminescence than 0.1WI, which suggests that excess MgO content on porous-TiO2 surface might form recombination centers.For ALD prepared samples, with only 1 layer of MgO overcoating, the photoluminescence was significantly reduced compared with porous-TiO2, the reduction in photoluminescence did not change much with more added ALD layers.Overall, the ALD samples showed lower photoluminescence intensity that the WI samples.This is likely due to the surface state passivation effect of ALD overcoating that hehp to reduce surface recombination.This mechanism was reported in our previously published work on CO2 photoreduction by TiO2 nanorods coated with an Al2O3 overlayer by ALD method 16. The CO2 photoreduction tests were conducted with continuous flow of CO2 and water vapor under UVvis irradiation.The performances of WI and ALD samples in terms of CO production in comparison with 9 was indeed derived from CO2 reduction by the photocatalyst.In this study, CO was found to be the major product, while trace CH4 production was found only on 2ALD, 5ALD and 10 ALD samples. No H2 production was detected.Thus, only CO production was given and compared among the various catalysts.Commercially available P25 was used as a reference to demonstrate the improved performance of pristine and MgO modified porous-TiO2.The CO produced by porous-TiO2 (12.7 mol/g) was 5.1-fold higher than that of P25 (2.5 mol/g).Since porous-TiO2 and P25 exhibited similar surface area (47.6 m 2 /g for porous-TiO2 vs. 50 m 2 /g for P25), the enhanced CO2 photoreduction performance was attributed to the following two factors: (a) the porous hierarchical structure of porous-TiO2; (b) the higher rutile to anatase ratio.The porous structure of porous-TiO2 allows favorable intraparticle gas diffusion and facilitates gas diffusion and reactant-product exchange with the bulk, leading to relatively high reactant and low product concentrations around the surface of photocatalyst.In addition, according to previous reports 515253, a phase weight ratio of 50-60 rutile in anatase/rutile mixed TiO2 presents highly improved photocatalytic performance compared with TiO2 with a higher anatase content.It is possible that the proper rutile percentage in porous-TiO2 (56) contributes to the improved performance in CO2 photocatalytic reduction performance of porous-TiO2 compared to P25. With the modification of MgO, all WI samples and ALD samples displayed enhancement in photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance.Due to the alkaline earth oxide nature of MgO, it is prone to generate surface hydroxyl even with the presence of trace amount of water vapor.The surface hydroxyl groups on MgO have higher basicity than those on TiO2 that are slightly acidic 54.For WI samples, the CO2 photoreduction performance improved with MgO addition amount from 0.1 to 2.Among all WI samples, the 2WI sample presented the best photoreduction performance, 40.5 mol/g, which is 3.2 times higher than porous-TiO2 and 16.2 times higher than P25.The improvement of 2WI compared with porous-TiO2 is attributed to favorable properties originated from the MgO modification such as surface Ti 3 species and Mg-OH groups as seen in Table 3.However, too much amount of MgO addition on photocatalyst surface can reduce the contact of CO2 molecule with TiO2.In addition, the CO production is normalized by the total mass of TiO2 and MgO, while TiO2 is the only photo-active material.Increasing the MgO content above 5 wt. did not increase the Ti 3 and Mg-OH significantly (Table 3) but reduced the amount of active TiO2 content.As can be seen in Figure 9a, with MgO percentage higher than 2, CO2 photoreduction performance started to drop. The performance of CO2 photoreduction by ALD samples are shown in Figure 9b.The addition of a single atomic layer of MgO doubled the amount of CO production compared with pristine porous-TiO2.The CO2 photoreduction performance increased with the number of ALD layer from 1 to 5 layers and then decreased with more than 5 layers.The 5ALD sample was the optimum one among all ALD samples, producing 54.0 mol/g CO, which was 4.3 times higher than porous-TiO2 and 21.3 times higher than P25.With 30.3 surface Ti 3 concentration, 2.2 Mg-OH and 41.8 MgO concentration, it is reasonable that the 5ALD sample performed significantly better than porous-TiO2, which had none of the above active species However, similar to WI samples, ALD samples with too \"thick\" a MgO overlayer (5 layers) experienced a decrease in CO2 photoreduction performance.The decline in CO production can be attributed to the following reasons: (1) a decrease in surface area is observed with too many ALD layers, as seen in Table 2, which hinders the transport and adsorption of CO2 in the porous TiO2; and (2) an increase in the thickness of ALD overlayer increases the resistance for photoexcited electrons and holes to transfer to the surface of photocatalyst to initiate CO2 reduction process.However, for catalysts with relatively \"thick\" layers such as 50ALD and 100ALD, the catalytic performance was not inferior to that of porous-TiO2 thanks to the surface passivation effect of ALD layers that prevent surface charge recombination 16. By comparing the photocurrent density data and CO2 photoreduction performance of 2WI and 5ALD, it was noticed that 2WI showed higher photocurrent density but showed worse photocatalytic CO2 performance compared to 5ALD.According to previously discussed, the major difference between 2WI and 5ALD is the MgO morphology.Due to the nature of WI method, MgO are deposited on 2WI as ultrafine nanoparticles, while MgO layer is more uniformly distributed on 5ALD.The difference in MgO morphology results variations in surface interaction with CO2 molecules and thus affect CO2 adsorption. The inconsistency in photocurrent density and overall CO2 photoreduction performance and the difference in MgO morphology suggests better affinity of CO2 with 5ALD over 2WI.Because of high coverage on photocatalysts, 5ALD has more surface area to serve as absorbent to CO2 molecules, as a result, photoexcited electrons can be more easily transferred to CO2 molecules and thus the overall performance is improved. In order to further demonstrate that porous-TiO2 as a better candidate for photocatalytic CO2 reduction applications over commercial P25, MgO modified P25 was prepared with 5 layers of MgO coating (denoted as 5ALD-P25) and 2 MgO of wet impregnation (denoted as 2WI-P25).It was found that 2WI-P25 produced 11.8 mol/g of CO (equivalent to 29.1 of that produced by 2WI-porous-TiO2), 5ALD-P25 sample produced 15.5 mol/g of CO (equivalent to 28.7 of that produced by 5ALD-porous- Combining the result that P25 produced only 2.5 mol/g of CO (equivalent to 19.2 of that produced by porous-TiO2), it is apparent that porous-TiO2 is advantageous over P25 no matter with or without MgO modification To investigate the effect of coating materials on the catalytic activity, we have conducted another experiment using ALD to coat 5 layers of Al2O3 on porous-TiO2.The sample is denoted as 5ALD(Al2O3), and its catalytic activity is compared with that by 5ALD(MgO).The 5ALD(Al2O3) sample produced 19.2 mol/g of CO, which is higher than the pristine porous-TiO2 (12.7 mol/g) but much lower than 5ALD(MgO) (54.0 mol/g) as shown in Figure 9.According to our previous report 16, an Al2O3ALD overlayer on TiO2 exhibits surface state preservation effect and thus promotes CO2 photoreduction performance.This conclusion is once again confirmed in this work by comparing 5ALD(Al2O3) with porous-TiO2.The difference in catalytic activity between 5ALD(Al2O3) and 5ALD(MgO) suggests that, in addition to surface state preservation effect, the MgO layer may promote adsorption of CO2 due to a higher surface basicity.Because of the extremely trace amount of ALD coated MgO present on the surface, it was not possible to differentiate the equilibrium CO2 adsorption capacity on the MgO-coated and Al2O3coated or non-coated samples.Given that the 2WI sample had 40.5 mol/g CO production that is still much higher than the 5ALD(Al2O3) sample, it is likely the surface CO2 adsorption enhancement due to MgO is one of the main reasons for the promoted CO2 photoreduction activity, as also evidenced in our previous studies. 22, 23 By comparing the best-performing ALD sample (5ALD) with the best-performing WI sample (2WI), one can see that the performance of 5ALD in CO production was 28 better than that of 2WI.The phase composition, surface area, crystal size, and band gap of 5ALD and 2WI were similar (Table 2). The surface Mg atomic concentrations of the two samples were also very close (Table 3).The most extinct difference of the two materials is the surface Ti 3 concentration (30.3 on 5ALD and 2.6 on 2WI), which may account for the better performance of 5ALD than 2WI.This is because Ti 3 is usually paired with oxygen vacancies and those defect sites play a crucial role in facilitating charge transfer and separation as well as CO2/H2O adsorption and dissociation on the catalyst surface 7,18,46,55. With regard to the CO2 photoreduction mechanism, it has been widely reported in the literature 565758 that the formation of CO and CH4 follows the two-and eight-electron reduction processes, respectively. It is reasonable that CO is found to be the major product in this work because much fewer electrons are needed to form CO than to form CH4. (1) Moreover, the surface oxygen vacancy/Ti 3 species is believed to improve CO2 adsorption and activation on the surface, according to the following reactions, where CO2 -, HCO3 -, and CO3 -species could be intermediate species for CO2 reduction (Spontaneous dissociation of CO2 to CO on defective surface of Cu (I)/TiO2-x nanoparticles at room temperature 59. In this work, MgO modified on the TiO2 surface, especially ALD-coated MgO significantly increased the surface Ti 3 and OH species, and thus contributed to the production of CO2 reduction intermediates as shown in Reactions (3)(4)(5).However, it is still not clear exactly how the MgO distribution and morphology affect the reaction pathways.This will be the direction of our future work."}, {"title": "Conclusions", "content": "This work for the first time applied ALD to effectively coat a thin, uniform layer of MgO on a MOFderived porous TiO2 photocatalyst and demonstrated significantly promoted CO2 photoreduction performance, which was more than 4 times and 18 times higher than those of porous TiO2 and commercial P25, respectively.A conventional wet-impregnation (WI) method was also applied to incorporate MgO on porous TiO2 to compare against the ALD method.MgO modified catalysts prepared by both methods showed enhancement in CO production because of the added surface basicity to enhance CO2 adsorption and the introduction of defect sites such as Ti 3 to promote electron-hole transfer.The ALD samples were advantageous over WI samples due to the generation of higher concentration of surface Ti 3 and the surface passivation effect of ALD coating that inhibits surface recombination.Material property analysis and photocatalytic activity results showed that ALD method is likely a better way for compared with conventional WI method with higher surface Ti 3 concentration, ALD coating surface state preservation effects as well as lower charge/hole recombination effects.The application of ALD as an enabling technique of surface modification to enhance catalytic performance successfully demonstrated in this work may be extended to catalysts beyond TiO2 and to catalytic reactions beyond CO2 reduction. lamp measured 30 cm away from the lamp is shown in Figure S1 (Supporting Information).Intensity of UV, visible, IR light of the Xe lamp measured with/without the quartz tube is listed in Table amounts of Mg addition.Mg 2p XPS spectra of 100ALD and 10WI are printed in FigureS8.Mg 2p peaks found at 50 eV confirm the existence of Mg element on both of the photocatalysts. optical property.Overall, neither WI nor ALD modification caused significant changes in the optical properties of porous-TiO2. photocatalysts in the dark; (c) Ar H2O with photocatalysts under UV-vis irradiation.No carbon Figure9was indeed derived from CO2 reduction by the photocatalyst.In this study, CO was found to be Figure 1.XRD patterns of (a) porous-TiO2, (b) 0.1WI, (c) 0.5WI, (d) 1WI, (e) 2WI, (f) 5WI, Figure 2.
