The g-C 3 N 4 was prepared by a traditional thermal polymerization method.Typically, 10 g of carbamide powder was lapped for 60 min in a mortar and then transferred to a 50 mL alumina crucible with a cover.Subsequently, the crucible was heated to 550 C with a rising rate of 18 C/min and kept for 2 h at 550 C, thereby obtaining the g-C 3 N 4 bulk with faint-yellow color. Typically, 100 mg g-C 3 N 4 bulk was ultrasonically dispersed into the deionized water to form the suspension solution of g-C 3 N 4 NSs.Then, the pH value of g-C 3 N 4 suspension solution was adjusted to 3.1 by dropwise adding 1.2 M of HCl solution.Afterward, 5, 10, 20, 30 mg of HPW were dissolved in deionized water and then added the obtained HPW solution to the g-C 3 N 4 suspension solution with vigorous stirring for 2 h.The weight ratio of HPW to g-C 3 N 4 was determined to be 5, 10, 20, and 30 wt., respectively.Subsequently, the mixture was separated by the centrifugal treatment, and dried at 70 C for 12 h to obtain the g-C 3 N 4 NSs loaded with different amount of HPW.Finally, the HPWloaded g-C 3 N 4 NSs were annealed at 300 C for 2 h under the vacuum condition, thereby synthesizing the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs. The laser particle size and zeta potential analyzer (Zetasizer SZ-100Z, Horiba) was used to measure the surface charge polarity of the samples.The crystallization and the phase transition were studied by X ray diffractometer (XRD; XRD-6000, Shimadzu) with a Cu K line of 0.1541 nm and the radiation is from 10to 80, at a scanning rate at 2/ min.Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were recorded on a Magna 560 FT-IR spectrometer with a resolution of 1 cm -1 .X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on a VG-ESCALAB LKII instrument with a Mg K ADES (h 1253.6eV) source at a residual gas pressure below 10 -8 Pa.The surface topography and sample thickness of as-prepared samples were studied by atomic force microscope (AFM; Bruker Dimension IconTM).The morphology and structure of the as-prepared samples were observed by scanning electron microscope (SEM; S-4800, Hitachi), transmission electron microscopy (TEM; JEM-2100, JEOL).Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out on a NETZSCH STA 449C thermo-analyzer in air.UV-vis absorption spectra were taken with a Lambda 750 UV/Vis/NIR spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer, USA).The specific surface areas of the asprepared samples were measured with a Micromeritics ASAP-2020 instrument and analyzed by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method.Decay curves of the as-prepared samples were obtained on a FLS920 fluorescence lifetime spectrophotometer (Edinburgh Instruments, UK) under the excitation of a hydrogen flash lamp with the wavelength at 325 nm (nF900; Edinburgh Instruments).Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were detected using fluorescence spectrophotometer (F-4600, Hitachi) equipped with a 150 W Xe lamp as the excited light source. 5 mg of the as-synthesized samples, 10 mL triethanolamine (TEOA, 15 vol.), and 10 L chloroplatinic acid (H 2 PtCl 6 , 12 mM) aqueous solution were added in a 35 mL quartz reactor, orderly.Then, the quartz reactor was sealed by a rubber plug, following by ventilation with argon gas for 10 min to drive away the residual air.Subsequently, the reactor was exposed under simulated sunlight (300-W Xe lamp, PLS-SXE300UV coupled with the AM1.5 filter).The gas product composition was periodically analyzed by a gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) (Beifen-Ruili Analytical Instrument, SP-3420A). 10 mg of the Pt-loaded sample was dispersed into 2 mL of deionized water to form a suspension.Then, the above suspension was uniformly dropped onto a 2 cm 2 cm glass substrate.As the water solvent evaporated, the film consisted of the Pt-loaded sample was formed on the glass substrate.Afterwards, the glass with the Pt-loaded sample was put into the 35-mL quartz reactor.Before the irradiation, the reactor was infused with high purity CO 2 for 30 min to degas the residual air.Meanwhile, 0.1 mL of deionized water was injected into the reactor for providing the water vapor.Finally, the reactor loading with the Ptloaded sample was exposed under a 500 W Xe lamp (PLS-SXE300UV).The gas products were periodically analyzed quantitatively by a gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) (Beifen-Ruili Analytical Instrument, SP-3420A). According to the first-principles calculations and analyses, we synthesized the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs through a facile threestep route (Fig. 2A): (i) the synthesis of the g-C 3 N 4 NSs by combining a traditional thermal polymerization method with the followed ultrasonic exfoliation treatment; (ii) the assembly of highly-dispersed HPW clusters onto the surfaces of g-C 3 N 4 NSs based on the electrostatic interaction force between HPW and g-C 3 N 4 ; (iii) the heat treatment of the HPW-adsorbed g-C 3 N 4 NSs to strengthen the chemical bonding at their hetero-interface, and thus obtaining the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs.During the synthesis process, we, at first, adjusted the surface charges of the g-C 3 N 4 NSs into the positive polarity for adsorbing the negatively-charged Keggin units in the aqueous solution.As shown in Fig. S1, the zeta potential of the as-synthesized g-C 3 N 4 NSs depends on pH value of the aqueous solution suspended with g-C 3 N 4 NSs.Particularly, the surface charges of the g-C 3 N 4 NSs could be changed into the positive polarity when the pH value of the suspension solution was adjusted below 4.5.Thus, a homogeneous dissolution of HPW molecules into the above g-C 3 N 4 NSs-suspended solution would induce a self-assembly of highly-dispersed HPW clusters on the surface of the g-C 3 N 4 NSs due to the electrostatic adsorption process between the negatively-charged PW 12 O 40 3-groups of HPW molecules and the positively-charged g-C 3 N 4 NSs.In order to reinforce the hetero-interface quality in the obtained HPW/g-C 3 N 4 composite NSs, the followed heattreatment process was carried out.It could further strengthen the chemical bonding at their hetero-interface, and leading to the formation of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs in the viewpoint of chemical kinetics and solid state physics 23242526. Fig. 2B shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the as-synthesized samples.For the sample of the g-C 3 N 4 NSs, two diffraction peaks appear at 13.1and 27.4, which can be indexed to the (100) and (002) planes of g-C 3 N 4 , respectively 7,8,15,27.For the sample of HPW, the diffraction peaks at 1012, 1622, 2330and 3140a re attributed to the typical HPW with a Keggin structure, which have ever been reported in previous literature 15.However, the characteristic diffraction peaks of HPW could not be observed in the XRD patterns of HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs, even though the mass ratio of HPW to g-C 3 N 4 was increased from 5 wt. to 30 wt..This phenomenon may be attributed to the fact that the ultra-small sized HPW units were highly dispersed on the surface of the g-C 3 N 4 NSs, thereby leading to a poor crystal-diffraction signal beyond the XRD probing limit. In order to ensure the co-existence of HPW and g-C 3 N 4 component in the heterojunction NSs, we investigated the Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of the as-synthesized samples (Fig. 2B,C).For the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs, the peaks located at 3400 cm -1 to 3000 cm -1 are attributed to stretching vibration of -NH 2 and NH amino groups, while several weak peaks ranging from 1700cm -1 to 1120 cm -1 are assigned to the stretching vibration modes of CeN and CN bonds in CN heterocycles.And, the peak at 812 cm -1 is related to the feature vibration mode of s-triazine ring unit 17,28.In the case of HPW, the feature vibration modes of keggin units are located at 1080.1 cm -1 , 981.76 cm -1 , 889.18 cm -1 , and 802.38 cm -1 , which denote the P-O a bonds of the PO 4 tetrahedron, the W O d bonds, and the two W-O b/c -W bonds, respectively 17.After coupling HPW with g-C 3 N 4 , the characteristic vibrational peaks related to both the g-C 3 N 4 NSs and HPW could be found simultaneously on the FT-IR spectrum of the formed HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs.As compared to the pure HPW, the three characteristic peaks related to Keggin units (WO d bonds, and two WeO b/c eW bonds) are shifted to 979.83 cm -1 , 893.04 cm -1 , and 812.03 cm -1 , respectively, on the FT-IR spectrum of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs.This phenomenon suggests the existence of chemical interaction between HPW and g-C 3 N 4 in their heterojunction NSs produced by the static adsorption-deposition method and subsequent vacuum annealing treatment. To determine in-depth the chemical interaction between the HPW and the g-C 3 N 4 components in their heterojunction NSs, the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses of the as-synthesized samples were implemented.As observed in Fig. 3A, three feature peaks, corresponding to sp 2 CeC bonds (284.6 eV), sp 3 -coordinated carbon bonds (285.4 eV), and N-bonded sp 2 C-atom in the s-triazine (NeCN) (287.8 eV) 29,30, can be detected on the C 1s core-level spectrum of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs.However, the feature peaks of the sp 3 -coordinated carbon bonds and the NeCN bonds on the spectrum of the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs shift to the higher binding energy side as compared to the corresponding peaks of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs.In addition, a new peak with the binding energy at around 286.2 eV was observed, which could be ascribed to the formation of CeO bands 31,32.Fig. 3B displays the N 1s core-level spectra of the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs in comparison with the g-C 3 N 4 NSs.It is obvious that the binding energies of the sp 2 -bonded N (CeNC), tertiary nitrogen N-(C) 3 groups, and amino groups (CeNeH) 8,33,34 on the spectrum of the heterojunction NSs are also higher than the corresponding energies on the spectrum of the pure g-C 3 N 4 .The O 1s core-level spectra of the pure HPW and the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs are given in Fig. 3C.The two feature peaks on the spectrum of the pure HPW are originated from to the WeOeW (530.8 eV) and WeOeP/WeOeH bonds (531.9 eV), respectively 17.In the case of 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs, the above two peaks also shift toward the higher binding energy side as compared to the pure HPW.Interestingly, the two new peaks attributed to the CeOeW (532.6 eV) and C(N) 3 -OH (533.7 eV) bonds 17,18,35, can be found on the O 1s core-level spectrum of the heterojunction NSs.The appeared C(N) 3 -OH bonds in the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs could be attributed to the substitution of the amino groups by the hydroxyl groups after the acidizing treatment of g-C 3 N 4 NSs 17,18, thereby leading to the formation of N defects.Meanwhile, the observation of the CeOeW bond is consistent with the DFT calculation results, further confirming that the HPW and g-C 3 N 4 in their heterojunction NSs are linked by the CeOeW bond.Notably, the W 4f 7/2 and W 4f 5/2 peaks of the pure HPW located at 35.8 and 37.9 eV 17,18, respectively, are shifted to the lower binding energy sides after forming the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction (Fig. 3D).According to the previous reports, the binding energy shifts on the XPS spectra of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs can be ascribed to the electron transfer across the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 hetero-interface through the formed CeOeW bond due to the different electron concentration between the two heterocomponents.Additionally, the P 2p core-level signal could be also detected on the XPS spectrum of HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs, as shown in Fig. S3.The binding energy peak centered at 133.8 eV indicates the existence of P 5 in the oxidation state 15,18, which is in agreement with the valence state of P in the HPW.It further demonstrates that the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs were constructed through the self-assembly method based on the static adsorption-deposition process. The aforementioned results confirm the successful synthesis of HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs.To determine the distribution and the size of HPW on the g-C 3 N 4 NSs, the as-synthesized samples were, at first, observed by atomic force microscope (AFM) images (Fig. 4).The g-C 3 N 4 NSs show up the smooth surfaces and layered structure (Fig. 4A).Besides, the thickness is between 3-5 nm (Fig. 4B,C).After combination with HPW, the surfaces of HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs is still flat (Fig. 4D) and the thickness of heterojunction NSs remain between 3-5 nm (Fig. 4E,F), implying the ultra-small size (may be less than 3 nm) and highly-dispersed distribution of the HPW clusters on the surfaces of the g-C 3 N 4 NSs.The morphologies of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs and the single component of g-C 3 N 4 NSs were further observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images.As shown in Fig. 5A, the g-C 3 N 4 exfoliated by the ultrasonic method exhibits a corrugated-sheet structure with smooth surface.After loading HPW clusters onto these exfoliated g-C 3 N 4 NSs through the adsorption-deposition method, the surface of the obtained HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs still remain smooth, as observed by the SEM images in Figs.5B andS2.Surprisingly, no morphology information of HPW clusters was found in both TEM and HRTEM images of HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs (Fig. 5C andD).This may be ascribed to the uniform dispersion of ultra-small sized HPW clusters onto the g-C 3 N 4 NSs.Interestingly, when we employed the HAADF-STEM image to detect the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs in-depth, lots of ultra-small bright dots with a high dispersity could be observed clearly on the surface of the heterojunction NSs (Fig. 5E).These bright dots can be recognized as the heavy element of such W originated from the HPW clusters, because the intensity in the HAADF image depends on the atomic number 36.The above evidence proves that the HPW clusters with sizes less than 2 nm are highly-dispersed on the g-C single hetero-components (Fig. S4).During the TGA testing, the used amounts of the samples are the same.For the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs, the total weight loss between 25 C and 800 C is about 97.2, resulting from the direct thermal decomposition of the g-C 3 N 4 NSs 37.For the pure HPW, there are two steps of mass loss on TGA curve.The first step is a loss of 9.5 between 25 C and 160 C as a result of the weight loss of physical-adsorbed water and crystallization water in HPW.And, the second mass loss of 3.1 between 160 C and 800 C is ascribed to the loss of acidic protons and the decomposition of the Keggin structure 38,39.According to the weight loss of 82.8 in the 20 wt. HPW/ g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs during the heat-treatment, it can be calculated that the actual weight ratio of HPW in the heterojunction NSs is 16.5.Thus, actual mass ratio of HPW to g-C 3 N 4 in the heterojunction NSs is 19.7 wt., which is consistent with the theoretical value (20 wt.) (more calculation details were presented in Supporting information). The light absorption properties of the as-synthesized samples were investigated through UV-vis adsorption spectra, and the corresponding results were shown in Fig. 6 and S5.It can be observed that the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs possess a broad light-absorption range spanning from UV-to visible-light region.However, the pure HPW only displays a UV-light adsorption property.The band gap (E g ) values of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs and HPW were calculated to be 2.75 eV and 3.01 eV, which are consistent with the literatures 12,40.After coupling the g-C 3 N 4 NSs with the HPW clusters, the formed HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs exhibited the blue-shifts of absorption edges as compared to the g-C 3 N 4 NSs.What' more, the blue-shift phenomenon for the absorption edge of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs increased gradually with increasing the HPW content in the NSs (Fig. S5).This result further proves that the ultra-small HPW clusters have been introduced into the g-C 3 N 4 NSs, forming the 2D HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs. Photocatalytic activities of the as-synthesized samples for H 2 generation were evaluated under simulated sunlight irradiation by serving triethanolamine (TEOA) as the sacrificial reagent to slake the photoinduced holes.The H 2 generation rates of the as-synthesized samples are summarized in Fig. 7A.It is showed that the H 2 -generation rate of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs is 6.6 mol h -1 , and the corresponding turnover number (TON) is 110 based on the used amount of Pt co-catalyst (one H 2 molecule per active metal site 41).Meanwhile, the pure HPW is no photoactivity for H 2 generation, which may be attributed to an improper energy-level of its LUMO with respect to that of H reduction potential 12.Notably, the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs show the increased rates of H 2 generation as compared to either the g-C 3 N 4 NSs or HPW hetero-components.It suggests that the static adsorption-deposition of the HPW clusters onto the g-C 3 N 4 NSs can lead to the formation of an effective charge-transfer channel at the intimate interface of the formed HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs, thus hindering the recombination of photoinduced charge-carriers in the g-C 3 N 4 component.Further investigation found that the H 2 generation rate of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs is dominated by the HPW content in the NSs.When the loading amount of HPW was below 20 wt. in the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs, the H 2 -generation rate of the heterojunction NSs increased with increasing the HPW loading.However, a further increase of HPW content (30 wt.) resulted in a decrease of the photocatalytic activity for H 2 generation.This could be ascribed to the fact that the excessive amount of HPW clusters loaded onto the surface of g-C 3 N 4 NSs would shield both the light-absorption and catalytic-active sites nearby the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 hetero-interface regions 28,34,42434445, although a promoted process of charge-transfer may occur in the large-area contact interface between the HPW and g-C 3 N 4 hetero-components.The optimal photocatalytic activity for H 2 generation (14.6 mol h -1 ) was achieved on the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NS (TON 243).Its H 2 -generation rate is 2.2 times higher than that of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs.Please note that only 5 mg of 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs were employed as the photocatalyst for H 2 generation in our work.As shown in Fig. 7B, the H 2 -production yields of all the synthesized g-C 3 N 4 -based samples linearly increase with the irradiation time.After simulated light irradiation for 2 h, the H 2 -generation amount of 20 wt. HPW clusters decorated g-C 3 N 4 NSs could reach 29.2 mol, which is greatly superior to that of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs (12.9 mol).It should be pointed out that after assembling HPW clusters onto the g-C 3 N 4 NSs, the specific-surface-areas of the formed HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs (25.0291 38.5376 m2/g) were similar to that of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs (30.2709 m2/g), as shown in Fig. S6.Thus, we believed that the enhanced photocatalytic activity of HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs for H 2 generation is mainly attributed to the existence of large amounts of uniformly-dispersed and ultra-small sized hetero-interface in the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs.The high-quality hetero-interface of HPW/g-C 3 N 4 with a fascinating molecular-scale structure can not only enhance the interfacial chargetransfer process, but also simultaneously offer abundant light-harvesting and catalytic-active sites at the hetero-interface region, thereby enabling a high-efficient utilization of photoinduced electrons for H 2 generation over the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs. According to the literatures, the energy-band positions of HPW (LUMO and HOMO) and g-C 3 N 4 (VB and CB) are staggered in their heterojunction interface.Thus, there are two possible photoinduced interfacial charge-transfer pathways in the heterojunction NSs (traditional \"type II\" heterojunction or direct Z-scheme mechanism), depending on the Fermi-level positions of the single HPW and g-C 3 N 4 components 464748495051.As shown in Fig. S7, if the Fermi-level of g-C 3 N 4 NSs is higher than that of the HPW, the electrons on the Fermi-level of g-C 3 N 4 NSs will transfer to the Fermi-level of HPW for balancing the Fermi-level of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction system.This electron transfer process creates a built-in electric filed at the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 hetero-interface with the vector direction from the g-C 3 N 4 to HPW sides.In this way, the formed interfacial built-in electric filed would drive \"type II\"-heterojunction charge-transfer process, where the photoinduced electrons transfer from the CB of g-C 3 N 4 to the LUMO of HPW, while the photoinduced holes migrate from the HOMO of HPW to the VB of g-C 3 N 4 .However, the LUMO energy-level of HPW component is below reduction potential of H , leading to photocatalytic inert of HPW for H 2 generation.Thus, the charge transfer process of \"type II\" heterojunction would lead to the decreased photocatalytic performance of HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs.However, this hypothesis is inconsistent with our experimental results.Therefore, we deduce that the contribution of the enhanced photocatalytic activity for HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs comes from the direct Z-scheme mechanism of the To further clarify this issue, we re-tested the photocatalytic activities of the as-synthesized g-C 3 N 4 NSs-based samples for H 2 generation upon visible light irradiation ( 420 nm), because the photon energy at the visible light region could only drive the photoinduced charge-carriers of the g-C 3 N 4 component in the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs.As observed in Fig. 7C, the introduction of photo-inert HPW clusters into g-C 3 N 4 NSs results in the decreased photocatalytic activities of the formed HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs for H 2 generation as compared to the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs.Meanwhile, with increasing the HPW-content from 5 to 30 wt. in the heterojunction NSs, the H 2 generation rate decreased from 3.5 to 2.8 mol h -1 .By combining this observation with the photocatalytic results obtained under simulated light irradiation, we can further confirm the following two aspects: (1) the photoinduced electrons on the LUMO of the HPW clusters are not capable of initiating the proton reduction reaction; (2) the photoinduced electrons on the CB of the g-C 3 N 4 hetero-component are hard to transfer to the HOMO level of the HPW hetero-component, which may be due to the existence of built-in electric-field with the vector direction from the g-C 3 N 4 to the HPW sides at HPW/g-C 3 N 4 hetero-interface for hindering the interfacial electron-transfer process of the \"type II\" heterojunction (Fig. S7).In other word, the built-in electric-field at the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 hetero-interface would drive the photoinduced electron transfer from the LUMO level of HPW heterocomponent to the VB of the g-C 3 N 4 hetero-component, thereby forming the direct Z-scheme mechanism of the photoinduced electron transfer after the excitation of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs. To strengthen the aforementioned conclusion, the spectral dependence of the photocatalytic performance was implemented on the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs along with the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs.As shown in Fig. 7D, upon UV light irradiation (365 and 380 nm), the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs displayed the higher photocatalytic H 2 -generation amount as compared with the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs.However, when the excitation photon energy is lower than the band gap of HPW component, the H 2 -generation amounts over the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs were lower than those of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs.These observations are in accordance with the above analysis results, revealing that the HPW component in the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs can serve as the photo-sensitizer to prolong the lifetimes of the photoinduced electrons on the CB of g-C 3 N 4 component based on the direct Z-scheme process of interfacial electron transfer.Moreover, the wavelength-dependent apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs and the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs can be calculated by the following equation: As shown in Fig. 7E, the curve linked by the AQE values of both the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction and the g-C 3 N 4 NSs are consistent with the results of the their corresponding UV-vis absorption spectra (Fig. 5A), powerfully confirming that the photocatalytic H 2 generation of these NSs are driven by the photoinduced charge-carriers.Notably, the AQE value of the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs (used 5 mg) is estimated as 0.65 under irradiation at 365 nm, which is obviously higher than that of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs.It suggests that although the photocatalytic quantum efficiency of the Z-scheme heterojunction photocatalyst, in theoretical, is only a half of that for the single hetero-components in the photocatalyst, the construction of the Zscheme heterojunction photocatalyst is still an effective strategy to hinder the recombination of photoinduced charge-carriers in the single hetero-components for enhancing photocatalytic solar-to-fuels conversion. Besides, the stability of the optimal as-prepared 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs was investigated through performing a cycling test of simulated sunlight-irradiated catalytic H 2 generation (Fig. S8).After three cycles, the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs maintained 93.1 of its initial photocatalytic activity in the first cycle, indicating a good photocatalytic stability of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs.To further generalize the idea of the enhancement of photoinduced charge-carriers separation from the decorated HPW, we used another photocatalytic reaction, photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with water vapor, as a model system to test the photocatalytic activity of the HPW/ g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs.Control experiments indicated that upon UV-vis light irradiation, there was no CO or CH 4 release in the absence of either CO 2 or the photocatalyst.These results reveal that the gas products were generated from the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction but not from the contaminants.As observed in Fig. 7F and7 G, CO gas is the only product during the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction over the g-C 3 N 4 and HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs photocatalysts.Upon UV-vis light irradiation, the CO-yield rate of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs (3.83 mol g -1 h -1 ) is 6.7 times higher than that of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs (0.56 mol g -1 h -1 ).Furthermore, the CO-yield of assynthesized samples increased with the irradiation time, suggesting the occurrence of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction over the samples.It can be found that the enhancement factor of the photocatalytic activity of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs to the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs in CO 2 reduction (6.7) is much higher than that in the above H 2 generation (2.2).This phenomenon can be explained by the fact that there is only a small proportion of UV light in the simulated sunlight spectrum, thereby leading to a weak excitation behavior of the HPW heterocomponent in the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs during the photocatalytic H 2 generation.When the proportion of UV light was increased in the UV-vis light spectrum (xenon lamp without any filter), the light excitation process of the HPW hetero-component in the heterojunction NSs could be enhanced.Thus, the interfacial charge transfer process in the Z-scheme HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs was further improved to cause the larger enhancement factor of the photocatalytic activity in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction. To further illuminate the Z-scheme mechanism in the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs, the steady-state and transient photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy of the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs were studied in comparison with that of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs.In Fig. 8A, by selecting the excitation wavelength at 325 nm, a strong emission peak at 446 nm is observed on the steady-state PL curve of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs.When these g-C 3 N 4 NSs were combined with the HPW clusters to form the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs, the intensity of emission peak at 446 nm was decreased.The decreased intensity of emission peak could be attributed to the possible existence of two kinds of charge-carrier dynamics processes in the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs: one is the transfer process of the photoinduced electrons from the LUMO of HPW component to the VB of g-C 3 N 4 component to quench the photoinduced holes on the VB of g-C 3 N 4 component; the other is the transfer process of photoinduced electrons from the CB of g-C 3 N 4 component to the LUMO of HPW component.To obtain a better understanding on the transfer process of photoinduced electrons between the g-C 3 N 4 and HPW components in their heterojunction NSs, a multiexponential decay function is used to fit the corresponding time-resolved transient PL spectroscopy.The function could be expressed as following 52: where 1 and 2 are the fluorescent lifetime, and A 1 , and A 2 are the corresponding amplitudes.This result suggests the existence of two different decay channels in the g-C 3 N 4 NSs after 325 nm excitation.As observed in the insets of Fig. 8B andC, the time constant ( 1 ) of the fast decay process is 2.19 ns for the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs, which is shorter than that of the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs (3.06 ns).This fast decay process is caused by the non-radiative recombination of photoinduced charge-carriers in the defect states of g-C 3 N 4 42,53,54. What's more, the time constant ( 2 ) of the slow decay process is originated from the radiative recombination of the free excitations in g-C 3 N 4 42,53,54.It can be found that the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs still possesses a longer lifetime (16.72 ns) than that of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs (10.48 ns).The average emission lifetimes of the above two samples can be calculated via the following equation 55: The results indicate that the average lifetime of g-C 3 N 4 NSs is extended from 6.78 ns to 8.94 ns after loading with the HPW clusters.This result provides a solid evidence to prove the fact that the dynamics process of the photoinduced charge-transfer across the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 hetero-interface followed the Z-scheme mechanism rather than the traditional \"type II\" heterojunction mechanism.According to the energy band structures of HPW and g-C 3 N 4 12, it could be deduced that in the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs, the photoinduced electrons on the LUMO of HPW transfer to the VB of g-C 3 N 4 to combine with the photoinduced holes on the g-C 3 N 4 side. To further elucidate the Z-scheme enhanced of photocatalytic activity of HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs for the solar-to-fuels conversion, the photoinduced charge-carriers transfer process in these heterojunction NSs is illustrated in Fig. 8D.Upon UV-vis light irradiation, the HPW clusters and the g-C 3 N 4 NSs in their heterojunction NSs are excited simultaneously.Then, the photoinduced electrons on the LUMO of the HPW component can transfer to VB of the g-C 3 N 4 component to quench its photoinduced holes, thereby greatly extending the lifetime of the photoinduced electrons on the CB of g-C 3 N 4 .Afterwards, these photoinduced electrons are further trapped by the co-catalysts of Pt nanoparticles to lower down their over-potentials for reducing the protons into H 2 and reducing CO 2 into CO, respectively 16,56.Meanwhile, the photoinduced holes remained at the HOMO of HPW component are capable of implementing some oxidation reaction in the presence of appropriate electron donors, for instance, TEOA for the H 2 generation and water for the CO 2 reduction in the our current study.According to the literatures 57,58, the possible pathway for CO 2 reduction on the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs may go through as follows: CO 2 (g) CO 2 (1) CO 2 e - H COOH COOH e - H CO H 2 O (4) CO CO (5) where \"\" represents the corresponding adsorption state on the catalyst surface.During the process of CO 2 reduction, the Z-scheme transfer mechanism of photoinduced charge-carriers could result in the enhanced separation of photoinduced charge-carriers in the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs to promote the photocatalytic activity of CO 2 reduction.However, when the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs were under visible irradiation, the interband transition of HPW is forbidden.This leads to no available photo-induced electrons on the LUMO of HPW for quenching the photoinduced holes of the g-C 3 N 4 NSs.Meanwhile, the built-in electric field at the interface HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction also hinders the transfer process of the photoinduced electron from the CB of the g-C 3 N 4 component to the LUMO of the HPW component, as illustrated in Fig. S7.In this way, the photocatalytic inert component of such HPW (for H 2 generation and CO 2 reduction) would shield the photocatalytic reaction sites of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs.Thus, the visible-light photocatalytic performance of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs decreases as the increase of loading amount of the HPW clusters on the g-C 3 N 4 NSs. In summary, we have successfully synthesized a Z-scheme photocatalyst with the molecular-scale hetero-interface through self-assembly of ultra-small HPW clusters onto g-C 3 N 4 NSs via a facile static adsorption-deposition method.The HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs possesses significant enhancements for both photocatalytic H 2 generation and CO 2 reduction based on the unique synergistic photocatalysis effect between the abundant surface active-sites, the high hetero-interface quality, as well as the Z-scheme-improved charge-carriers separation process.The as-synthesized 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heteojunction NSs exhibited 2.2 and 6.7 folds on photocatalytic H 2 generation and CO 2 reduction, respectively, as compared to the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs, even though the pure HPW component was photocatalytic-inert for either H 2 generation or CO 2 reduction upon UV-vis light irradiation.It is anticipated that the designed HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs may provide new insights for exploring molecular-scale heteropolyacid-decorated 2D layered Z-scheme photocatalysts with high hetero-interface quality and abundant active-sites for photocatalytic solar-to-fuels conversion.

The g-C 3 N 4 was prepared by a traditional thermal polymerization method.Typically, 10 g of carbamide powder was lapped for 60 min in a mortar and then transferred to a 50 mL alumina crucible with a cover.Subsequently, the crucible was heated to 550 C with a rising rate of 18 C/min and kept for 2 h at 550 C, thereby obtaining the g-C 3 N 4 bulk with faint-yellow color. Typically, 100 mg g-C 3 N 4 bulk was ultrasonically dispersed into the deionized water to form the suspension solution of g-C 3 N 4 NSs.Then, the pH value of g-C 3 N 4 suspension solution was adjusted to 3.1 by dropwise adding 1.2 M of HCl solution.Afterward, 5, 10, 20, 30 mg of HPW were dissolved in deionized water and then added the obtained HPW solution to the g-C 3 N 4 suspension solution with vigorous stirring for 2 h.The weight ratio of HPW to g-C 3 N 4 was determined to be 5, 10, 20, and 30 wt., respectively.Subsequently, the mixture was separated by the centrifugal treatment, and dried at 70 C for 12 h to obtain the g-C 3 N 4 NSs loaded with different amount of HPW.Finally, the HPWloaded g-C 3 N 4 NSs were annealed at 300 C for 2 h under the vacuum condition, thereby synthesizing the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs. The laser particle size and zeta potential analyzer (Zetasizer SZ-100Z, Horiba) was used to measure the surface charge polarity of the samples.The crystallization and the phase transition were studied by X ray diffractometer (XRD; XRD-6000, Shimadzu) with a Cu K line of 0.1541 nm and the radiation is from 10to 80, at a scanning rate at 2/ min.Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were recorded on a Magna 560 FT-IR spectrometer with a resolution of 1 cm -1 .X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on a VG-ESCALAB LKII instrument with a Mg K ADES (h 1253.6eV) source at a residual gas pressure below 10 -8 Pa.The surface topography and sample thickness of as-prepared samples were studied by atomic force microscope (AFM; Bruker Dimension IconTM).The morphology and structure of the as-prepared samples were observed by scanning electron microscope (SEM; S-4800, Hitachi), transmission electron microscopy (TEM; JEM-2100, JEOL).Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out on a NETZSCH STA 449C thermo-analyzer in air.UV-vis absorption spectra were taken with a Lambda 750 UV/Vis/NIR spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer, USA).The specific surface areas of the asprepared samples were measured with a Micromeritics ASAP-2020 instrument and analyzed by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method.Decay curves of the as-prepared samples were obtained on a FLS920 fluorescence lifetime spectrophotometer (Edinburgh Instruments, UK) under the excitation of a hydrogen flash lamp with the wavelength at 325 nm (nF900; Edinburgh Instruments).Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were detected using fluorescence spectrophotometer (F-4600, Hitachi) equipped with a 150 W Xe lamp as the excited light source. 5 mg of the as-synthesized samples, 10 mL triethanolamine (TEOA, 15 vol.), and 10 L chloroplatinic acid (H 2 PtCl 6 , 12 mM) aqueous solution were added in a 35 mL quartz reactor, orderly.Then, the quartz reactor was sealed by a rubber plug, following by ventilation with argon gas for 10 min to drive away the residual air.Subsequently, the reactor was exposed under simulated sunlight (300-W Xe lamp, PLS-SXE300UV coupled with the AM1.5 filter).The gas product composition was periodically analyzed by a gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) (Beifen-Ruili Analytical Instrument, SP-3420A). 10 mg of the Pt-loaded sample was dispersed into 2 mL of deionized water to form a suspension.Then, the above suspension was uniformly dropped onto a 2 cm 2 cm glass substrate.As the water solvent evaporated, the film consisted of the Pt-loaded sample was formed on the glass substrate.Afterwards, the glass with the Pt-loaded sample was put into the 35-mL quartz reactor.Before the irradiation, the reactor was infused with high purity CO 2 for 30 min to degas the residual air.Meanwhile, 0.1 mL of deionized water was injected into the reactor for providing the water vapor.Finally, the reactor loading with the Ptloaded sample was exposed under a 500 W Xe lamp (PLS-SXE300UV).The gas products were periodically analyzed quantitatively by a gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) (Beifen-Ruili Analytical Instrument, SP-3420A). According to the first-principles calculations and analyses, we synthesized the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs through a facile threestep route (Fig. 2A): (i) the synthesis of the g-C 3 N 4 NSs by combining a traditional thermal polymerization method with the followed ultrasonic exfoliation treatment; (ii) the assembly of highly-dispersed HPW clusters onto the surfaces of g-C 3 N 4 NSs based on the electrostatic interaction force between HPW and g-C 3 N 4 ; (iii) the heat treatment of the HPW-adsorbed g-C 3 N 4 NSs to strengthen the chemical bonding at their hetero-interface, and thus obtaining the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs.During the synthesis process, we, at first, adjusted the surface charges of the g-C 3 N 4 NSs into the positive polarity for adsorbing the negatively-charged Keggin units in the aqueous solution.As shown in Fig. S1, the zeta potential of the as-synthesized g-C 3 N 4 NSs depends on pH value of the aqueous solution suspended with g-C 3 N 4 NSs.Particularly, the surface charges of the g-C 3 N 4 NSs could be changed into the positive polarity when the pH value of the suspension solution was adjusted below 4.5.Thus, a homogeneous dissolution of HPW molecules into the above g-C 3 N 4 NSs-suspended solution would induce a self-assembly of highly-dispersed HPW clusters on the surface of the g-C 3 N 4 NSs due to the electrostatic adsorption process between the negatively-charged PW 12 O 40 3-groups of HPW molecules and the positively-charged g-C 3 N 4 NSs.In order to reinforce the hetero-interface quality in the obtained HPW/g-C 3 N 4 composite NSs, the followed heattreatment process was carried out.It could further strengthen the chemical bonding at their hetero-interface, and leading to the formation of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs in the viewpoint of chemical kinetics and solid state physics 23242526. Fig. 2B shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the as-synthesized samples.For the sample of the g-C 3 N 4 NSs, two diffraction peaks appear at 13.1and 27.4, which can be indexed to the (100) and (002) planes of g-C 3 N 4 , respectively 7,8,15,27.For the sample of HPW, the diffraction peaks at 1012, 1622, 2330and 3140a re attributed to the typical HPW with a Keggin structure, which have ever been reported in previous literature 15.However, the characteristic diffraction peaks of HPW could not be observed in the XRD patterns of HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs, even though the mass ratio of HPW to g-C 3 N 4 was increased from 5 wt. to 30 wt..This phenomenon may be attributed to the fact that the ultra-small sized HPW units were highly dispersed on the surface of the g-C 3 N 4 NSs, thereby leading to a poor crystal-diffraction signal beyond the XRD probing limit. In order to ensure the co-existence of HPW and g-C 3 N 4 component in the heterojunction NSs, we investigated the Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of the as-synthesized samples (Fig. 2B,C).For the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs, the peaks located at 3400 cm -1 to 3000 cm -1 are attributed to stretching vibration of -NH 2 and NH amino groups, while several weak peaks ranging from 1700cm -1 to 1120 cm -1 are assigned to the stretching vibration modes of CeN and CN bonds in CN heterocycles.And, the peak at 812 cm -1 is related to the feature vibration mode of s-triazine ring unit 17,28.In the case of HPW, the feature vibration modes of keggin units are located at 1080.1 cm -1 , 981.76 cm -1 , 889.18 cm -1 , and 802.38 cm -1 , which denote the P-O a bonds of the PO 4 tetrahedron, the W O d bonds, and the two W-O b/c -W bonds, respectively 17.After coupling HPW with g-C 3 N 4 , the characteristic vibrational peaks related to both the g-C 3 N 4 NSs and HPW could be found simultaneously on the FT-IR spectrum of the formed HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs.As compared to the pure HPW, the three characteristic peaks related to Keggin units (WO d bonds, and two WeO b/c eW bonds) are shifted to 979.83 cm -1 , 893.04 cm -1 , and 812.03 cm -1 , respectively, on the FT-IR spectrum of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs.This phenomenon suggests the existence of chemical interaction between HPW and g-C 3 N 4 in their heterojunction NSs produced by the static adsorption-deposition method and subsequent vacuum annealing treatment. To determine in-depth the chemical interaction between the HPW and the g-C 3 N 4 components in their heterojunction NSs, the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses of the as-synthesized samples were implemented.As observed in Fig. 3A, three feature peaks, corresponding to sp 2 CeC bonds (284.6 eV), sp 3 -coordinated carbon bonds (285.4 eV), and N-bonded sp 2 C-atom in the s-triazine (NeCN) (287.8 eV) 29,30, can be detected on the C 1s core-level spectrum of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs.However, the feature peaks of the sp 3 -coordinated carbon bonds and the NeCN bonds on the spectrum of the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs shift to the higher binding energy side as compared to the corresponding peaks of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs.In addition, a new peak with the binding energy at around 286.2 eV was observed, which could be ascribed to the formation of CeO bands 31,32.Fig. 3B displays the N 1s core-level spectra of the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs in comparison with the g-C 3 N 4 NSs.It is obvious that the binding energies of the sp 2 -bonded N (CeNC), tertiary nitrogen N-(C) 3 groups, and amino groups (CeNeH) 8,33,34 on the spectrum of the heterojunction NSs are also higher than the corresponding energies on the spectrum of the pure g-C 3 N 4 .The O 1s core-level spectra of the pure HPW and the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs are given in Fig. 3C.The two feature peaks on the spectrum of the pure HPW are originated from to the WeOeW (530.8 eV) and WeOeP/WeOeH bonds (531.9 eV), respectively 17.In the case of 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs, the above two peaks also shift toward the higher binding energy side as compared to the pure HPW.Interestingly, the two new peaks attributed to the CeOeW (532.6 eV) and C(N) 3 -OH (533.7 eV) bonds 17,18,35, can be found on the O 1s core-level spectrum of the heterojunction NSs.The appeared C(N) 3 -OH bonds in the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs could be attributed to the substitution of the amino groups by the hydroxyl groups after the acidizing treatment of g-C 3 N 4 NSs 17,18, thereby leading to the formation of N defects.Meanwhile, the observation of the CeOeW bond is consistent with the DFT calculation results, further confirming that the HPW and g-C 3 N 4 in their heterojunction NSs are linked by the CeOeW bond.Notably, the W 4f 7/2 and W 4f 5/2 peaks of the pure HPW located at 35.8 and 37.9 eV 17,18, respectively, are shifted to the lower binding energy sides after forming the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction (Fig. 3D).According to the previous reports, the binding energy shifts on the XPS spectra of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs can be ascribed to the electron transfer across the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 hetero-interface through the formed CeOeW bond due to the different electron concentration between the two heterocomponents.Additionally, the P 2p core-level signal could be also detected on the XPS spectrum of HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs, as shown in Fig. S3.The binding energy peak centered at 133.8 eV indicates the existence of P 5 in the oxidation state 15,18, which is in agreement with the valence state of P in the HPW.It further demonstrates that the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs were constructed through the self-assembly method based on the static adsorption-deposition process. The aforementioned results confirm the successful synthesis of HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs.To determine the distribution and the size of HPW on the g-C 3 N 4 NSs, the as-synthesized samples were, at first, observed by atomic force microscope (AFM) images (Fig. 4).The g-C 3 N 4 NSs show up the smooth surfaces and layered structure (Fig. 4A).Besides, the thickness is between 3-5 nm (Fig. 4B,C).After combination with HPW, the surfaces of HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs is still flat (Fig. 4D) and the thickness of heterojunction NSs remain between 3-5 nm (Fig. 4E,F), implying the ultra-small size (may be less than 3 nm) and highly-dispersed distribution of the HPW clusters on the surfaces of the g-C 3 N 4 NSs.The morphologies of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs and the single component of g-C 3 N 4 NSs were further observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images.As shown in Fig. 5A, the g-C 3 N 4 exfoliated by the ultrasonic method exhibits a corrugated-sheet structure with smooth surface.After loading HPW clusters onto these exfoliated g-C 3 N 4 NSs through the adsorption-deposition method, the surface of the obtained HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs still remain smooth, as observed by the SEM images in Figs.5B andS2.Surprisingly, no morphology information of HPW clusters was found in both TEM and HRTEM images of HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs (Fig. 5C andD).This may be ascribed to the uniform dispersion of ultra-small sized HPW clusters onto the g-C 3 N 4 NSs.Interestingly, when we employed the HAADF-STEM image to detect the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs in-depth, lots of ultra-small bright dots with a high dispersity could be observed clearly on the surface of the heterojunction NSs (Fig. 5E).These bright dots can be recognized as the heavy element of such W originated from the HPW clusters, because the intensity in the HAADF image depends on the atomic number 36.The above evidence proves that the HPW clusters with sizes less than 2 nm are highly-dispersed on the g-C single hetero-components (Fig. S4).During the TGA testing, the used amounts of the samples are the same.For the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs, the total weight loss between 25 C and 800 C is about 97.2, resulting from the direct thermal decomposition of the g-C 3 N 4 NSs 37.For the pure HPW, there are two steps of mass loss on TGA curve.The first step is a loss of 9.5 between 25 C and 160 C as a result of the weight loss of physical-adsorbed water and crystallization water in HPW.And, the second mass loss of 3.1 between 160 C and 800 C is ascribed to the loss of acidic protons and the decomposition of the Keggin structure 38,39.According to the weight loss of 82.8 in the 20 wt. HPW/ g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs during the heat-treatment, it can be calculated that the actual weight ratio of HPW in the heterojunction NSs is 16.5.Thus, actual mass ratio of HPW to g-C 3 N 4 in the heterojunction NSs is 19.7 wt., which is consistent with the theoretical value (20 wt.) (more calculation details were presented in Supporting information). The light absorption properties of the as-synthesized samples were investigated through UV-vis adsorption spectra, and the corresponding results were shown in Fig. 6 and S5.It can be observed that the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs possess a broad light-absorption range spanning from UV-to visible-light region.However, the pure HPW only displays a UV-light adsorption property.The band gap (E g ) values of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs and HPW were calculated to be 2.75 eV and 3.01 eV, which are consistent with the literatures 12,40.After coupling the g-C 3 N 4 NSs with the HPW clusters, the formed HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs exhibited the blue-shifts of absorption edges as compared to the g-C 3 N 4 NSs.What' more, the blue-shift phenomenon for the absorption edge of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs increased gradually with increasing the HPW content in the NSs (Fig. S5).This result further proves that the ultra-small HPW clusters have been introduced into the g-C 3 N 4 NSs, forming the 2D HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs. Photocatalytic activities of the as-synthesized samples for H 2 generation were evaluated under simulated sunlight irradiation by serving triethanolamine (TEOA) as the sacrificial reagent to slake the photoinduced holes.The H 2 generation rates of the as-synthesized samples are summarized in Fig. 7A.It is showed that the H 2 -generation rate of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs is 6.6 mol h -1 , and the corresponding turnover number (TON) is 110 based on the used amount of Pt co-catalyst (one H 2 molecule per active metal site 41).Meanwhile, the pure HPW is no photoactivity for H 2 generation, which may be attributed to an improper energy-level of its LUMO with respect to that of H reduction potential 12.Notably, the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs show the increased rates of H 2 generation as compared to either the g-C 3 N 4 NSs or HPW hetero-components.It suggests that the static adsorption-deposition of the HPW clusters onto the g-C 3 N 4 NSs can lead to the formation of an effective charge-transfer channel at the intimate interface of the formed HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs, thus hindering the recombination of photoinduced charge-carriers in the g-C 3 N 4 component.Further investigation found that the H 2 generation rate of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs is dominated by the HPW content in the NSs.When the loading amount of HPW was below 20 wt. in the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs, the H 2 -generation rate of the heterojunction NSs increased with increasing the HPW loading.However, a further increase of HPW content (30 wt.) resulted in a decrease of the photocatalytic activity for H 2 generation.This could be ascribed to the fact that the excessive amount of HPW clusters loaded onto the surface of g-C 3 N 4 NSs would shield both the light-absorption and catalytic-active sites nearby the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 hetero-interface regions 28,34,42434445, although a promoted process of charge-transfer may occur in the large-area contact interface between the HPW and g-C 3 N 4 hetero-components.The optimal photocatalytic activity for H 2 generation (14.6 mol h -1 ) was achieved on the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NS (TON 243).Its H 2 -generation rate is 2.2 times higher than that of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs.Please note that only 5 mg of 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs were employed as the photocatalyst for H 2 generation in our work.As shown in Fig. 7B, the H 2 -production yields of all the synthesized g-C 3 N 4 -based samples linearly increase with the irradiation time.After simulated light irradiation for 2 h, the H 2 -generation amount of 20 wt. HPW clusters decorated g-C 3 N 4 NSs could reach 29.2 mol, which is greatly superior to that of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs (12.9 mol).It should be pointed out that after assembling HPW clusters onto the g-C 3 N 4 NSs, the specific-surface-areas of the formed HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs (25.0291 38.5376 m2/g) were similar to that of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs (30.2709 m2/g), as shown in Fig. S6.Thus, we believed that the enhanced photocatalytic activity of HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs for H 2 generation is mainly attributed to the existence of large amounts of uniformly-dispersed and ultra-small sized hetero-interface in the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs.The high-quality hetero-interface of HPW/g-C 3 N 4 with a fascinating molecular-scale structure can not only enhance the interfacial chargetransfer process, but also simultaneously offer abundant light-harvesting and catalytic-active sites at the hetero-interface region, thereby enabling a high-efficient utilization of photoinduced electrons for H 2 generation over the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs. According to the literatures, the energy-band positions of HPW (LUMO and HOMO) and g-C 3 N 4 (VB and CB) are staggered in their heterojunction interface.Thus, there are two possible photoinduced interfacial charge-transfer pathways in the heterojunction NSs (traditional \"type II\" heterojunction or direct Z-scheme mechanism), depending on the Fermi-level positions of the single HPW and g-C 3 N 4 components 464748495051.As shown in Fig. S7, if the Fermi-level of g-C 3 N 4 NSs is higher than that of the HPW, the electrons on the Fermi-level of g-C 3 N 4 NSs will transfer to the Fermi-level of HPW for balancing the Fermi-level of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction system.This electron transfer process creates a built-in electric filed at the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 hetero-interface with the vector direction from the g-C 3 N 4 to HPW sides.In this way, the formed interfacial built-in electric filed would drive \"type II\"-heterojunction charge-transfer process, where the photoinduced electrons transfer from the CB of g-C 3 N 4 to the LUMO of HPW, while the photoinduced holes migrate from the HOMO of HPW to the VB of g-C 3 N 4 .However, the LUMO energy-level of HPW component is below reduction potential of H , leading to photocatalytic inert of HPW for H 2 generation.Thus, the charge transfer process of \"type II\" heterojunction would lead to the decreased photocatalytic performance of HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs.However, this hypothesis is inconsistent with our experimental results.Therefore, we deduce that the contribution of the enhanced photocatalytic activity for HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs comes from the direct Z-scheme mechanism of the To further clarify this issue, we re-tested the photocatalytic activities of the as-synthesized g-C 3 N 4 NSs-based samples for H 2 generation upon visible light irradiation ( 420 nm), because the photon energy at the visible light region could only drive the photoinduced charge-carriers of the g-C 3 N 4 component in the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs.As observed in Fig. 7C, the introduction of photo-inert HPW clusters into g-C 3 N 4 NSs results in the decreased photocatalytic activities of the formed HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs for H 2 generation as compared to the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs.Meanwhile, with increasing the HPW-content from 5 to 30 wt. in the heterojunction NSs, the H 2 generation rate decreased from 3.5 to 2.8 mol h -1 .By combining this observation with the photocatalytic results obtained under simulated light irradiation, we can further confirm the following two aspects: (1) the photoinduced electrons on the LUMO of the HPW clusters are not capable of initiating the proton reduction reaction; (2) the photoinduced electrons on the CB of the g-C 3 N 4 hetero-component are hard to transfer to the HOMO level of the HPW hetero-component, which may be due to the existence of built-in electric-field with the vector direction from the g-C 3 N 4 to the HPW sides at HPW/g-C 3 N 4 hetero-interface for hindering the interfacial electron-transfer process of the \"type II\" heterojunction (Fig. S7).In other word, the built-in electric-field at the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 hetero-interface would drive the photoinduced electron transfer from the LUMO level of HPW heterocomponent to the VB of the g-C 3 N 4 hetero-component, thereby forming the direct Z-scheme mechanism of the photoinduced electron transfer after the excitation of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs. To strengthen the aforementioned conclusion, the spectral dependence of the photocatalytic performance was implemented on the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs along with the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs.As shown in Fig. 7D, upon UV light irradiation (365 and 380 nm), the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs displayed the higher photocatalytic H 2 -generation amount as compared with the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs.However, when the excitation photon energy is lower than the band gap of HPW component, the H 2 -generation amounts over the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs were lower than those of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs.These observations are in accordance with the above analysis results, revealing that the HPW component in the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs can serve as the photo-sensitizer to prolong the lifetimes of the photoinduced electrons on the CB of g-C 3 N 4 component based on the direct Z-scheme process of interfacial electron transfer.Moreover, the wavelength-dependent apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs and the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs can be calculated by the following equation: As shown in Fig. 7E, the curve linked by the AQE values of both the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction and the g-C 3 N 4 NSs are consistent with the results of the their corresponding UV-vis absorption spectra (Fig. 5A), powerfully confirming that the photocatalytic H 2 generation of these NSs are driven by the photoinduced charge-carriers.Notably, the AQE value of the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs (used 5 mg) is estimated as 0.65 under irradiation at 365 nm, which is obviously higher than that of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs.It suggests that although the photocatalytic quantum efficiency of the Z-scheme heterojunction photocatalyst, in theoretical, is only a half of that for the single hetero-components in the photocatalyst, the construction of the Zscheme heterojunction photocatalyst is still an effective strategy to hinder the recombination of photoinduced charge-carriers in the single hetero-components for enhancing photocatalytic solar-to-fuels conversion. Besides, the stability of the optimal as-prepared 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs was investigated through performing a cycling test of simulated sunlight-irradiated catalytic H 2 generation (Fig. S8).After three cycles, the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs maintained 93.1 of its initial photocatalytic activity in the first cycle, indicating a good photocatalytic stability of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs.To further generalize the idea of the enhancement of photoinduced charge-carriers separation from the decorated HPW, we used another photocatalytic reaction, photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with water vapor, as a model system to test the photocatalytic activity of the HPW/ g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs.Control experiments indicated that upon UV-vis light irradiation, there was no CO or CH 4 release in the absence of either CO 2 or the photocatalyst.These results reveal that the gas products were generated from the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction but not from the contaminants.As observed in Fig. 7F and7 G, CO gas is the only product during the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction over the g-C 3 N 4 and HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs photocatalysts.Upon UV-vis light irradiation, the CO-yield rate of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs (3.83 mol g -1 h -1 ) is 6.7 times higher than that of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs (0.56 mol g -1 h -1 ).Furthermore, the CO-yield of assynthesized samples increased with the irradiation time, suggesting the occurrence of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction over the samples.It can be found that the enhancement factor of the photocatalytic activity of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs to the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs in CO 2 reduction (6.7) is much higher than that in the above H 2 generation (2.2).This phenomenon can be explained by the fact that there is only a small proportion of UV light in the simulated sunlight spectrum, thereby leading to a weak excitation behavior of the HPW heterocomponent in the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs during the photocatalytic H 2 generation.When the proportion of UV light was increased in the UV-vis light spectrum (xenon lamp without any filter), the light excitation process of the HPW hetero-component in the heterojunction NSs could be enhanced.Thus, the interfacial charge transfer process in the Z-scheme HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs was further improved to cause the larger enhancement factor of the photocatalytic activity in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction. To further illuminate the Z-scheme mechanism in the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs, the steady-state and transient photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy of the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs were studied in comparison with that of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs.In Fig. 8A, by selecting the excitation wavelength at 325 nm, a strong emission peak at 446 nm is observed on the steady-state PL curve of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs.When these g-C 3 N 4 NSs were combined with the HPW clusters to form the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs, the intensity of emission peak at 446 nm was decreased.The decreased intensity of emission peak could be attributed to the possible existence of two kinds of charge-carrier dynamics processes in the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs: one is the transfer process of the photoinduced electrons from the LUMO of HPW component to the VB of g-C 3 N 4 component to quench the photoinduced holes on the VB of g-C 3 N 4 component; the other is the transfer process of photoinduced electrons from the CB of g-C 3 N 4 component to the LUMO of HPW component.To obtain a better understanding on the transfer process of photoinduced electrons between the g-C 3 N 4 and HPW components in their heterojunction NSs, a multiexponential decay function is used to fit the corresponding time-resolved transient PL spectroscopy.The function could be expressed as following 52: where 1 and 2 are the fluorescent lifetime, and A 1 , and A 2 are the corresponding amplitudes.This result suggests the existence of two different decay channels in the g-C 3 N 4 NSs after 325 nm excitation.As observed in the insets of Fig. 8B andC, the time constant ( 1 ) of the fast decay process is 2.19 ns for the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs, which is shorter than that of the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs (3.06 ns).This fast decay process is caused by the non-radiative recombination of photoinduced charge-carriers in the defect states of g-C 3 N 4 42,53,54. What's more, the time constant ( 2 ) of the slow decay process is originated from the radiative recombination of the free excitations in g-C 3 N 4 42,53,54.It can be found that the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs still possesses a longer lifetime (16.72 ns) than that of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs (10.48 ns).The average emission lifetimes of the above two samples can be calculated via the following equation 55: The results indicate that the average lifetime of g-C 3 N 4 NSs is extended from 6.78 ns to 8.94 ns after loading with the HPW clusters.This result provides a solid evidence to prove the fact that the dynamics process of the photoinduced charge-transfer across the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 hetero-interface followed the Z-scheme mechanism rather than the traditional \"type II\" heterojunction mechanism.According to the energy band structures of HPW and g-C 3 N 4 12, it could be deduced that in the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs, the photoinduced electrons on the LUMO of HPW transfer to the VB of g-C 3 N 4 to combine with the photoinduced holes on the g-C 3 N 4 side. To further elucidate the Z-scheme enhanced of photocatalytic activity of HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs for the solar-to-fuels conversion, the photoinduced charge-carriers transfer process in these heterojunction NSs is illustrated in Fig. 8D.Upon UV-vis light irradiation, the HPW clusters and the g-C 3 N 4 NSs in their heterojunction NSs are excited simultaneously.Then, the photoinduced electrons on the LUMO of the HPW component can transfer to VB of the g-C 3 N 4 component to quench its photoinduced holes, thereby greatly extending the lifetime of the photoinduced electrons on the CB of g-C 3 N 4 .Afterwards, these photoinduced electrons are further trapped by the co-catalysts of Pt nanoparticles to lower down their over-potentials for reducing the protons into H 2 and reducing CO 2 into CO, respectively 16,56.Meanwhile, the photoinduced holes remained at the HOMO of HPW component are capable of implementing some oxidation reaction in the presence of appropriate electron donors, for instance, TEOA for the H 2 generation and water for the CO 2 reduction in the our current study.According to the literatures 57,58, the possible pathway for CO 2 reduction on the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs may go through as follows: CO 2 (g) CO 2 (1) CO 2 e - H COOH COOH e - H CO H 2 O (4) CO CO (5) where \"\" represents the corresponding adsorption state on the catalyst surface.During the process of CO 2 reduction, the Z-scheme transfer mechanism of photoinduced charge-carriers could result in the enhanced separation of photoinduced charge-carriers in the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs to promote the photocatalytic activity of CO 2 reduction.However, when the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs were under visible irradiation, the interband transition of HPW is forbidden.This leads to no available photo-induced electrons on the LUMO of HPW for quenching the photoinduced holes of the g-C 3 N 4 NSs.Meanwhile, the built-in electric field at the interface HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction also hinders the transfer process of the photoinduced electron from the CB of the g-C 3 N 4 component to the LUMO of the HPW component, as illustrated in Fig. S7.In this way, the photocatalytic inert component of such HPW (for H 2 generation and CO 2 reduction) would shield the photocatalytic reaction sites of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs.Thus, the visible-light photocatalytic performance of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs decreases as the increase of loading amount of the HPW clusters on the g-C 3 N 4 NSs. In summary, we have successfully synthesized a Z-scheme photocatalyst with the molecular-scale hetero-interface through self-assembly of ultra-small HPW clusters onto g-C 3 N 4 NSs via a facile static adsorption-deposition method.The HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs possesses significant enhancements for both photocatalytic H 2 generation and CO 2 reduction based on the unique synergistic photocatalysis effect between the abundant surface active-sites, the high hetero-interface quality, as well as the Z-scheme-improved charge-carriers separation process.The as-synthesized 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heteojunction NSs exhibited 2.2 and 6.7 folds on photocatalytic H 2 generation and CO 2 reduction, respectively, as compared to the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs, even though the pure HPW component was photocatalytic-inert for either H 2 generation or CO 2 reduction upon UV-vis light irradiation.It is anticipated that the designed HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs may provide new insights for exploring molecular-scale heteropolyacid-decorated 2D layered Z-scheme photocatalysts with high hetero-interface quality and abundant active-sites for photocatalytic solar-to-fuels conversion.

The g-C 3 N 4 was prepared by a traditional thermal polymerization method.Typically, 10 g of carbamide powder was lapped for 60 min in a mortar and then transferred to a 50 mL alumina crucible with a cover.Subsequently, the crucible was heated to 550 C with a rising rate of 18 C/min and kept for 2 h at 550 C, thereby obtaining the g-C 3 N 4 bulk with faint-yellow color. Typically, 100 mg g-C 3 N 4 bulk was ultrasonically dispersed into the deionized water to form the suspension solution of g-C 3 N 4 NSs.Then, the pH value of g-C 3 N 4 suspension solution was adjusted to 3.1 by dropwise adding 1.2 M of HCl solution.Afterward, 5, 10, 20, 30 mg of HPW were dissolved in deionized water and then added the obtained HPW solution to the g-C 3 N 4 suspension solution with vigorous stirring for 2 h.The weight ratio of HPW to g-C 3 N 4 was determined to be 5, 10, 20, and 30 wt., respectively.Subsequently, the mixture was separated by the centrifugal treatment, and dried at 70 C for 12 h to obtain the g-C 3 N 4 NSs loaded with different amount of HPW.Finally, the HPWloaded g-C 3 N 4 NSs were annealed at 300 C for 2 h under the vacuum condition, thereby synthesizing the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs. The laser particle size and zeta potential analyzer (Zetasizer SZ-100Z, Horiba) was used to measure the surface charge polarity of the samples.The crystallization and the phase transition were studied by X ray diffractometer (XRD; XRD-6000, Shimadzu) with a Cu K line of 0.1541 nm and the radiation is from 10to 80, at a scanning rate at 2/ min.Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were recorded on a Magna 560 FT-IR spectrometer with a resolution of 1 cm -1 .X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on a VG-ESCALAB LKII instrument with a Mg K ADES (h 1253.6eV) source at a residual gas pressure below 10 -8 Pa.The surface topography and sample thickness of as-prepared samples were studied by atomic force microscope (AFM; Bruker Dimension IconTM).The morphology and structure of the as-prepared samples were observed by scanning electron microscope (SEM; S-4800, Hitachi), transmission electron microscopy (TEM; JEM-2100, JEOL).Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out on a NETZSCH STA 449C thermo-analyzer in air.UV-vis absorption spectra were taken with a Lambda 750 UV/Vis/NIR spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer, USA).The specific surface areas of the asprepared samples were measured with a Micromeritics ASAP-2020 instrument and analyzed by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method.Decay curves of the as-prepared samples were obtained on a FLS920 fluorescence lifetime spectrophotometer (Edinburgh Instruments, UK) under the excitation of a hydrogen flash lamp with the wavelength at 325 nm (nF900; Edinburgh Instruments).Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were detected using fluorescence spectrophotometer (F-4600, Hitachi) equipped with a 150 W Xe lamp as the excited light source. 5 mg of the as-synthesized samples, 10 mL triethanolamine (TEOA, 15 vol.), and 10 L chloroplatinic acid (H 2 PtCl 6 , 12 mM) aqueous solution were added in a 35 mL quartz reactor, orderly.Then, the quartz reactor was sealed by a rubber plug, following by ventilation with argon gas for 10 min to drive away the residual air.Subsequently, the reactor was exposed under simulated sunlight (300-W Xe lamp, PLS-SXE300UV coupled with the AM1.5 filter).The gas product composition was periodically analyzed by a gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) (Beifen-Ruili Analytical Instrument, SP-3420A). 10 mg of the Pt-loaded sample was dispersed into 2 mL of deionized water to form a suspension.Then, the above suspension was uniformly dropped onto a 2 cm 2 cm glass substrate.As the water solvent evaporated, the film consisted of the Pt-loaded sample was formed on the glass substrate.Afterwards, the glass with the Pt-loaded sample was put into the 35-mL quartz reactor.Before the irradiation, the reactor was infused with high purity CO 2 for 30 min to degas the residual air.Meanwhile, 0.1 mL of deionized water was injected into the reactor for providing the water vapor.Finally, the reactor loading with the Ptloaded sample was exposed under a 500 W Xe lamp (PLS-SXE300UV).The gas products were periodically analyzed quantitatively by a gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) (Beifen-Ruili Analytical Instrument, SP-3420A). According to the first-principles calculations and analyses, we synthesized the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs through a facile threestep route (Fig. 2A): (i) the synthesis of the g-C 3 N 4 NSs by combining a traditional thermal polymerization method with the followed ultrasonic exfoliation treatment; (ii) the assembly of highly-dispersed HPW clusters onto the surfaces of g-C 3 N 4 NSs based on the electrostatic interaction force between HPW and g-C 3 N 4 ; (iii) the heat treatment of the HPW-adsorbed g-C 3 N 4 NSs to strengthen the chemical bonding at their hetero-interface, and thus obtaining the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs.During the synthesis process, we, at first, adjusted the surface charges of the g-C 3 N 4 NSs into the positive polarity for adsorbing the negatively-charged Keggin units in the aqueous solution.As shown in Fig. S1, the zeta potential of the as-synthesized g-C 3 N 4 NSs depends on pH value of the aqueous solution suspended with g-C 3 N 4 NSs.Particularly, the surface charges of the g-C 3 N 4 NSs could be changed into the positive polarity when the pH value of the suspension solution was adjusted below 4.5.Thus, a homogeneous dissolution of HPW molecules into the above g-C 3 N 4 NSs-suspended solution would induce a self-assembly of highly-dispersed HPW clusters on the surface of the g-C 3 N 4 NSs due to the electrostatic adsorption process between the negatively-charged PW 12 O 40 3-groups of HPW molecules and the positively-charged g-C 3 N 4 NSs.In order to reinforce the hetero-interface quality in the obtained HPW/g-C 3 N 4 composite NSs, the followed heattreatment process was carried out.It could further strengthen the chemical bonding at their hetero-interface, and leading to the formation of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs in the viewpoint of chemical kinetics and solid state physics 23242526. Fig. 2B shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the as-synthesized samples.For the sample of the g-C 3 N 4 NSs, two diffraction peaks appear at 13.1and 27.4, which can be indexed to the (100) and (002) planes of g-C 3 N 4 , respectively 7,8,15,27.For the sample of HPW, the diffraction peaks at 1012, 1622, 2330and 3140a re attributed to the typical HPW with a Keggin structure, which have ever been reported in previous literature 15.However, the characteristic diffraction peaks of HPW could not be observed in the XRD patterns of HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs, even though the mass ratio of HPW to g-C 3 N 4 was increased from 5 wt. to 30 wt..This phenomenon may be attributed to the fact that the ultra-small sized HPW units were highly dispersed on the surface of the g-C 3 N 4 NSs, thereby leading to a poor crystal-diffraction signal beyond the XRD probing limit. In order to ensure the co-existence of HPW and g-C 3 N 4 component in the heterojunction NSs, we investigated the Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of the as-synthesized samples (Fig. 2B,C).For the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs, the peaks located at 3400 cm -1 to 3000 cm -1 are attributed to stretching vibration of -NH 2 and NH amino groups, while several weak peaks ranging from 1700cm -1 to 1120 cm -1 are assigned to the stretching vibration modes of CeN and CN bonds in CN heterocycles.And, the peak at 812 cm -1 is related to the feature vibration mode of s-triazine ring unit 17,28.In the case of HPW, the feature vibration modes of keggin units are located at 1080.1 cm -1 , 981.76 cm -1 , 889.18 cm -1 , and 802.38 cm -1 , which denote the P-O a bonds of the PO 4 tetrahedron, the W O d bonds, and the two W-O b/c -W bonds, respectively 17.After coupling HPW with g-C 3 N 4 , the characteristic vibrational peaks related to both the g-C 3 N 4 NSs and HPW could be found simultaneously on the FT-IR spectrum of the formed HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs.As compared to the pure HPW, the three characteristic peaks related to Keggin units (WO d bonds, and two WeO b/c eW bonds) are shifted to 979.83 cm -1 , 893.04 cm -1 , and 812.03 cm -1 , respectively, on the FT-IR spectrum of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs.This phenomenon suggests the existence of chemical interaction between HPW and g-C 3 N 4 in their heterojunction NSs produced by the static adsorption-deposition method and subsequent vacuum annealing treatment. To determine in-depth the chemical interaction between the HPW and the g-C 3 N 4 components in their heterojunction NSs, the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses of the as-synthesized samples were implemented.As observed in Fig. 3A, three feature peaks, corresponding to sp 2 CeC bonds (284.6 eV), sp 3 -coordinated carbon bonds (285.4 eV), and N-bonded sp 2 C-atom in the s-triazine (NeCN) (287.8 eV) 29,30, can be detected on the C 1s core-level spectrum of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs.However, the feature peaks of the sp 3 -coordinated carbon bonds and the NeCN bonds on the spectrum of the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs shift to the higher binding energy side as compared to the corresponding peaks of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs.In addition, a new peak with the binding energy at around 286.2 eV was observed, which could be ascribed to the formation of CeO bands 31,32.Fig. 3B displays the N 1s core-level spectra of the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs in comparison with the g-C 3 N 4 NSs.It is obvious that the binding energies of the sp 2 -bonded N (CeNC), tertiary nitrogen N-(C) 3 groups, and amino groups (CeNeH) 8,33,34 on the spectrum of the heterojunction NSs are also higher than the corresponding energies on the spectrum of the pure g-C 3 N 4 .The O 1s core-level spectra of the pure HPW and the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs are given in Fig. 3C.The two feature peaks on the spectrum of the pure HPW are originated from to the WeOeW (530.8 eV) and WeOeP/WeOeH bonds (531.9 eV), respectively 17.In the case of 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs, the above two peaks also shift toward the higher binding energy side as compared to the pure HPW.Interestingly, the two new peaks attributed to the CeOeW (532.6 eV) and C(N) 3 -OH (533.7 eV) bonds 17,18,35, can be found on the O 1s core-level spectrum of the heterojunction NSs.The appeared C(N) 3 -OH bonds in the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs could be attributed to the substitution of the amino groups by the hydroxyl groups after the acidizing treatment of g-C 3 N 4 NSs 17,18, thereby leading to the formation of N defects.Meanwhile, the observation of the CeOeW bond is consistent with the DFT calculation results, further confirming that the HPW and g-C 3 N 4 in their heterojunction NSs are linked by the CeOeW bond.Notably, the W 4f 7/2 and W 4f 5/2 peaks of the pure HPW located at 35.8 and 37.9 eV 17,18, respectively, are shifted to the lower binding energy sides after forming the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction (Fig. 3D).According to the previous reports, the binding energy shifts on the XPS spectra of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs can be ascribed to the electron transfer across the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 hetero-interface through the formed CeOeW bond due to the different electron concentration between the two heterocomponents.Additionally, the P 2p core-level signal could be also detected on the XPS spectrum of HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs, as shown in Fig. S3.The binding energy peak centered at 133.8 eV indicates the existence of P 5 in the oxidation state 15,18, which is in agreement with the valence state of P in the HPW.It further demonstrates that the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs were constructed through the self-assembly method based on the static adsorption-deposition process. The aforementioned results confirm the successful synthesis of HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs.To determine the distribution and the size of HPW on the g-C 3 N 4 NSs, the as-synthesized samples were, at first, observed by atomic force microscope (AFM) images (Fig. 4).The g-C 3 N 4 NSs show up the smooth surfaces and layered structure (Fig. 4A).Besides, the thickness is between 3-5 nm (Fig. 4B,C).After combination with HPW, the surfaces of HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs is still flat (Fig. 4D) and the thickness of heterojunction NSs remain between 3-5 nm (Fig. 4E,F), implying the ultra-small size (may be less than 3 nm) and highly-dispersed distribution of the HPW clusters on the surfaces of the g-C 3 N 4 NSs.The morphologies of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs and the single component of g-C 3 N 4 NSs were further observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images.As shown in Fig. 5A, the g-C 3 N 4 exfoliated by the ultrasonic method exhibits a corrugated-sheet structure with smooth surface.After loading HPW clusters onto these exfoliated g-C 3 N 4 NSs through the adsorption-deposition method, the surface of the obtained HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs still remain smooth, as observed by the SEM images in Figs.5B andS2.Surprisingly, no morphology information of HPW clusters was found in both TEM and HRTEM images of HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs (Fig. 5C andD).This may be ascribed to the uniform dispersion of ultra-small sized HPW clusters onto the g-C 3 N 4 NSs.Interestingly, when we employed the HAADF-STEM image to detect the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs in-depth, lots of ultra-small bright dots with a high dispersity could be observed clearly on the surface of the heterojunction NSs (Fig. 5E).These bright dots can be recognized as the heavy element of such W originated from the HPW clusters, because the intensity in the HAADF image depends on the atomic number 36.The above evidence proves that the HPW clusters with sizes less than 2 nm are highly-dispersed on the g-C single hetero-components (Fig. S4).During the TGA testing, the used amounts of the samples are the same.For the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs, the total weight loss between 25 C and 800 C is about 97.2, resulting from the direct thermal decomposition of the g-C 3 N 4 NSs 37.For the pure HPW, there are two steps of mass loss on TGA curve.The first step is a loss of 9.5 between 25 C and 160 C as a result of the weight loss of physical-adsorbed water and crystallization water in HPW.And, the second mass loss of 3.1 between 160 C and 800 C is ascribed to the loss of acidic protons and the decomposition of the Keggin structure 38,39.According to the weight loss of 82.8 in the 20 wt. HPW/ g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs during the heat-treatment, it can be calculated that the actual weight ratio of HPW in the heterojunction NSs is 16.5.Thus, actual mass ratio of HPW to g-C 3 N 4 in the heterojunction NSs is 19.7 wt., which is consistent with the theoretical value (20 wt.) (more calculation details were presented in Supporting information). The light absorption properties of the as-synthesized samples were investigated through UV-vis adsorption spectra, and the corresponding results were shown in Fig. 6 and S5.It can be observed that the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs possess a broad light-absorption range spanning from UV-to visible-light region.However, the pure HPW only displays a UV-light adsorption property.The band gap (E g ) values of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs and HPW were calculated to be 2.75 eV and 3.01 eV, which are consistent with the literatures 12,40.After coupling the g-C 3 N 4 NSs with the HPW clusters, the formed HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs exhibited the blue-shifts of absorption edges as compared to the g-C 3 N 4 NSs.What' more, the blue-shift phenomenon for the absorption edge of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs increased gradually with increasing the HPW content in the NSs (Fig. S5).This result further proves that the ultra-small HPW clusters have been introduced into the g-C 3 N 4 NSs, forming the 2D HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs. Photocatalytic activities of the as-synthesized samples for H 2 generation were evaluated under simulated sunlight irradiation by serving triethanolamine (TEOA) as the sacrificial reagent to slake the photoinduced holes.The H 2 generation rates of the as-synthesized samples are summarized in Fig. 7A.It is showed that the H 2 -generation rate of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs is 6.6 mol h -1 , and the corresponding turnover number (TON) is 110 based on the used amount of Pt co-catalyst (one H 2 molecule per active metal site 41).Meanwhile, the pure HPW is no photoactivity for H 2 generation, which may be attributed to an improper energy-level of its LUMO with respect to that of H reduction potential 12.Notably, the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs show the increased rates of H 2 generation as compared to either the g-C 3 N 4 NSs or HPW hetero-components.It suggests that the static adsorption-deposition of the HPW clusters onto the g-C 3 N 4 NSs can lead to the formation of an effective charge-transfer channel at the intimate interface of the formed HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs, thus hindering the recombination of photoinduced charge-carriers in the g-C 3 N 4 component.Further investigation found that the H 2 generation rate of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs is dominated by the HPW content in the NSs.When the loading amount of HPW was below 20 wt. in the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs, the H 2 -generation rate of the heterojunction NSs increased with increasing the HPW loading.However, a further increase of HPW content (30 wt.) resulted in a decrease of the photocatalytic activity for H 2 generation.This could be ascribed to the fact that the excessive amount of HPW clusters loaded onto the surface of g-C 3 N 4 NSs would shield both the light-absorption and catalytic-active sites nearby the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 hetero-interface regions 28,34,42434445, although a promoted process of charge-transfer may occur in the large-area contact interface between the HPW and g-C 3 N 4 hetero-components.The optimal photocatalytic activity for H 2 generation (14.6 mol h -1 ) was achieved on the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NS (TON 243).Its H 2 -generation rate is 2.2 times higher than that of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs.Please note that only 5 mg of 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs were employed as the photocatalyst for H 2 generation in our work.As shown in Fig. 7B, the H 2 -production yields of all the synthesized g-C 3 N 4 -based samples linearly increase with the irradiation time.After simulated light irradiation for 2 h, the H 2 -generation amount of 20 wt. HPW clusters decorated g-C 3 N 4 NSs could reach 29.2 mol, which is greatly superior to that of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs (12.9 mol).It should be pointed out that after assembling HPW clusters onto the g-C 3 N 4 NSs, the specific-surface-areas of the formed HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs (25.0291 38.5376 m2/g) were similar to that of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs (30.2709 m2/g), as shown in Fig. S6.Thus, we believed that the enhanced photocatalytic activity of HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs for H 2 generation is mainly attributed to the existence of large amounts of uniformly-dispersed and ultra-small sized hetero-interface in the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs.The high-quality hetero-interface of HPW/g-C 3 N 4 with a fascinating molecular-scale structure can not only enhance the interfacial chargetransfer process, but also simultaneously offer abundant light-harvesting and catalytic-active sites at the hetero-interface region, thereby enabling a high-efficient utilization of photoinduced electrons for H 2 generation over the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs. According to the literatures, the energy-band positions of HPW (LUMO and HOMO) and g-C 3 N 4 (VB and CB) are staggered in their heterojunction interface.Thus, there are two possible photoinduced interfacial charge-transfer pathways in the heterojunction NSs (traditional \"type II\" heterojunction or direct Z-scheme mechanism), depending on the Fermi-level positions of the single HPW and g-C 3 N 4 components 464748495051.As shown in Fig. S7, if the Fermi-level of g-C 3 N 4 NSs is higher than that of the HPW, the electrons on the Fermi-level of g-C 3 N 4 NSs will transfer to the Fermi-level of HPW for balancing the Fermi-level of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction system.This electron transfer process creates a built-in electric filed at the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 hetero-interface with the vector direction from the g-C 3 N 4 to HPW sides.In this way, the formed interfacial built-in electric filed would drive \"type II\"-heterojunction charge-transfer process, where the photoinduced electrons transfer from the CB of g-C 3 N 4 to the LUMO of HPW, while the photoinduced holes migrate from the HOMO of HPW to the VB of g-C 3 N 4 .However, the LUMO energy-level of HPW component is below reduction potential of H , leading to photocatalytic inert of HPW for H 2 generation.Thus, the charge transfer process of \"type II\" heterojunction would lead to the decreased photocatalytic performance of HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs.However, this hypothesis is inconsistent with our experimental results.Therefore, we deduce that the contribution of the enhanced photocatalytic activity for HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs comes from the direct Z-scheme mechanism of the To further clarify this issue, we re-tested the photocatalytic activities of the as-synthesized g-C 3 N 4 NSs-based samples for H 2 generation upon visible light irradiation ( 420 nm), because the photon energy at the visible light region could only drive the photoinduced charge-carriers of the g-C 3 N 4 component in the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs.As observed in Fig. 7C, the introduction of photo-inert HPW clusters into g-C 3 N 4 NSs results in the decreased photocatalytic activities of the formed HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs for H 2 generation as compared to the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs.Meanwhile, with increasing the HPW-content from 5 to 30 wt. in the heterojunction NSs, the H 2 generation rate decreased from 3.5 to 2.8 mol h -1 .By combining this observation with the photocatalytic results obtained under simulated light irradiation, we can further confirm the following two aspects: (1) the photoinduced electrons on the LUMO of the HPW clusters are not capable of initiating the proton reduction reaction; (2) the photoinduced electrons on the CB of the g-C 3 N 4 hetero-component are hard to transfer to the HOMO level of the HPW hetero-component, which may be due to the existence of built-in electric-field with the vector direction from the g-C 3 N 4 to the HPW sides at HPW/g-C 3 N 4 hetero-interface for hindering the interfacial electron-transfer process of the \"type II\" heterojunction (Fig. S7).In other word, the built-in electric-field at the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 hetero-interface would drive the photoinduced electron transfer from the LUMO level of HPW heterocomponent to the VB of the g-C 3 N 4 hetero-component, thereby forming the direct Z-scheme mechanism of the photoinduced electron transfer after the excitation of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs. To strengthen the aforementioned conclusion, the spectral dependence of the photocatalytic performance was implemented on the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs along with the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs.As shown in Fig. 7D, upon UV light irradiation (365 and 380 nm), the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs displayed the higher photocatalytic H 2 -generation amount as compared with the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs.However, when the excitation photon energy is lower than the band gap of HPW component, the H 2 -generation amounts over the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs were lower than those of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs.These observations are in accordance with the above analysis results, revealing that the HPW component in the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs can serve as the photo-sensitizer to prolong the lifetimes of the photoinduced electrons on the CB of g-C 3 N 4 component based on the direct Z-scheme process of interfacial electron transfer.Moreover, the wavelength-dependent apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs and the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs can be calculated by the following equation: As shown in Fig. 7E, the curve linked by the AQE values of both the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction and the g-C 3 N 4 NSs are consistent with the results of the their corresponding UV-vis absorption spectra (Fig. 5A), powerfully confirming that the photocatalytic H 2 generation of these NSs are driven by the photoinduced charge-carriers.Notably, the AQE value of the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs (used 5 mg) is estimated as 0.65 under irradiation at 365 nm, which is obviously higher than that of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs.It suggests that although the photocatalytic quantum efficiency of the Z-scheme heterojunction photocatalyst, in theoretical, is only a half of that for the single hetero-components in the photocatalyst, the construction of the Zscheme heterojunction photocatalyst is still an effective strategy to hinder the recombination of photoinduced charge-carriers in the single hetero-components for enhancing photocatalytic solar-to-fuels conversion. Besides, the stability of the optimal as-prepared 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs was investigated through performing a cycling test of simulated sunlight-irradiated catalytic H 2 generation (Fig. S8).After three cycles, the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs maintained 93.1 of its initial photocatalytic activity in the first cycle, indicating a good photocatalytic stability of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs.To further generalize the idea of the enhancement of photoinduced charge-carriers separation from the decorated HPW, we used another photocatalytic reaction, photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with water vapor, as a model system to test the photocatalytic activity of the HPW/ g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs.Control experiments indicated that upon UV-vis light irradiation, there was no CO or CH 4 release in the absence of either CO 2 or the photocatalyst.These results reveal that the gas products were generated from the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction but not from the contaminants.As observed in Fig. 7F and7 G, CO gas is the only product during the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction over the g-C 3 N 4 and HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs photocatalysts.Upon UV-vis light irradiation, the CO-yield rate of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs (3.83 mol g -1 h -1 ) is 6.7 times higher than that of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs (0.56 mol g -1 h -1 ).Furthermore, the CO-yield of assynthesized samples increased with the irradiation time, suggesting the occurrence of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction over the samples.It can be found that the enhancement factor of the photocatalytic activity of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs to the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs in CO 2 reduction (6.7) is much higher than that in the above H 2 generation (2.2).This phenomenon can be explained by the fact that there is only a small proportion of UV light in the simulated sunlight spectrum, thereby leading to a weak excitation behavior of the HPW heterocomponent in the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs during the photocatalytic H 2 generation.When the proportion of UV light was increased in the UV-vis light spectrum (xenon lamp without any filter), the light excitation process of the HPW hetero-component in the heterojunction NSs could be enhanced.Thus, the interfacial charge transfer process in the Z-scheme HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs was further improved to cause the larger enhancement factor of the photocatalytic activity in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction. To further illuminate the Z-scheme mechanism in the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs, the steady-state and transient photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy of the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs were studied in comparison with that of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs.In Fig. 8A, by selecting the excitation wavelength at 325 nm, a strong emission peak at 446 nm is observed on the steady-state PL curve of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs.When these g-C 3 N 4 NSs were combined with the HPW clusters to form the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs, the intensity of emission peak at 446 nm was decreased.The decreased intensity of emission peak could be attributed to the possible existence of two kinds of charge-carrier dynamics processes in the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs: one is the transfer process of the photoinduced electrons from the LUMO of HPW component to the VB of g-C 3 N 4 component to quench the photoinduced holes on the VB of g-C 3 N 4 component; the other is the transfer process of photoinduced electrons from the CB of g-C 3 N 4 component to the LUMO of HPW component.To obtain a better understanding on the transfer process of photoinduced electrons between the g-C 3 N 4 and HPW components in their heterojunction NSs, a multiexponential decay function is used to fit the corresponding time-resolved transient PL spectroscopy.The function could be expressed as following 52: where 1 and 2 are the fluorescent lifetime, and A 1 , and A 2 are the corresponding amplitudes.This result suggests the existence of two different decay channels in the g-C 3 N 4 NSs after 325 nm excitation.As observed in the insets of Fig. 8B andC, the time constant ( 1 ) of the fast decay process is 2.19 ns for the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs, which is shorter than that of the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs (3.06 ns).This fast decay process is caused by the non-radiative recombination of photoinduced charge-carriers in the defect states of g-C 3 N 4 42,53,54. What's more, the time constant ( 2 ) of the slow decay process is originated from the radiative recombination of the free excitations in g-C 3 N 4 42,53,54.It can be found that the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs still possesses a longer lifetime (16.72 ns) than that of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs (10.48 ns).The average emission lifetimes of the above two samples can be calculated via the following equation 55: The results indicate that the average lifetime of g-C 3 N 4 NSs is extended from 6.78 ns to 8.94 ns after loading with the HPW clusters.This result provides a solid evidence to prove the fact that the dynamics process of the photoinduced charge-transfer across the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 hetero-interface followed the Z-scheme mechanism rather than the traditional \"type II\" heterojunction mechanism.According to the energy band structures of HPW and g-C 3 N 4 12, it could be deduced that in the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs, the photoinduced electrons on the LUMO of HPW transfer to the VB of g-C 3 N 4 to combine with the photoinduced holes on the g-C 3 N 4 side. To further elucidate the Z-scheme enhanced of photocatalytic activity of HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs for the solar-to-fuels conversion, the photoinduced charge-carriers transfer process in these heterojunction NSs is illustrated in Fig. 8D.Upon UV-vis light irradiation, the HPW clusters and the g-C 3 N 4 NSs in their heterojunction NSs are excited simultaneously.Then, the photoinduced electrons on the LUMO of the HPW component can transfer to VB of the g-C 3 N 4 component to quench its photoinduced holes, thereby greatly extending the lifetime of the photoinduced electrons on the CB of g-C 3 N 4 .Afterwards, these photoinduced electrons are further trapped by the co-catalysts of Pt nanoparticles to lower down their over-potentials for reducing the protons into H 2 and reducing CO 2 into CO, respectively 16,56.Meanwhile, the photoinduced holes remained at the HOMO of HPW component are capable of implementing some oxidation reaction in the presence of appropriate electron donors, for instance, TEOA for the H 2 generation and water for the CO 2 reduction in the our current study.According to the literatures 57,58, the possible pathway for CO 2 reduction on the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs may go through as follows: CO 2 (g) CO 2 (1) CO 2 e - H COOH COOH e - H CO H 2 O (4) CO CO (5) where \"\" represents the corresponding adsorption state on the catalyst surface.During the process of CO 2 reduction, the Z-scheme transfer mechanism of photoinduced charge-carriers could result in the enhanced separation of photoinduced charge-carriers in the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs to promote the photocatalytic activity of CO 2 reduction.However, when the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs were under visible irradiation, the interband transition of HPW is forbidden.This leads to no available photo-induced electrons on the LUMO of HPW for quenching the photoinduced holes of the g-C 3 N 4 NSs.Meanwhile, the built-in electric field at the interface HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction also hinders the transfer process of the photoinduced electron from the CB of the g-C 3 N 4 component to the LUMO of the HPW component, as illustrated in Fig. S7.In this way, the photocatalytic inert component of such HPW (for H 2 generation and CO 2 reduction) would shield the photocatalytic reaction sites of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs.Thus, the visible-light photocatalytic performance of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs decreases as the increase of loading amount of the HPW clusters on the g-C 3 N 4 NSs. In summary, we have successfully synthesized a Z-scheme photocatalyst with the molecular-scale hetero-interface through self-assembly of ultra-small HPW clusters onto g-C 3 N 4 NSs via a facile static adsorption-deposition method.The HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs possesses significant enhancements for both photocatalytic H 2 generation and CO 2 reduction based on the unique synergistic photocatalysis effect between the abundant surface active-sites, the high hetero-interface quality, as well as the Z-scheme-improved charge-carriers separation process.The as-synthesized 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heteojunction NSs exhibited 2.2 and 6.7 folds on photocatalytic H 2 generation and CO 2 reduction, respectively, as compared to the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs, even though the pure HPW component was photocatalytic-inert for either H 2 generation or CO 2 reduction upon UV-vis light irradiation.It is anticipated that the designed HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs may provide new insights for exploring molecular-scale heteropolyacid-decorated 2D layered Z-scheme photocatalysts with high hetero-interface quality and abundant active-sites for photocatalytic solar-to-fuels conversion.

HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs in comparison with the corresponding curves of the Fig. 3. XPS spectra of (a) g-C 3 N 4 NSs (b) 20 wt.

The g-C 3 N 4 was prepared by a traditional thermal polymerization method.Typically, 10 g of carbamide powder was lapped for 60 min in a mortar and then transferred to a 50 mL alumina crucible with a cover.Subsequently, the crucible was heated to 550 C with a rising rate of 18 C/min and kept for 2 h at 550 C, thereby obtaining the g-C 3 N 4 bulk with faint-yellow color. Typically, 100 mg g-C 3 N 4 bulk was ultrasonically dispersed into the deionized water to form the suspension solution of g-C 3 N 4 NSs.Then, the pH value of g-C 3 N 4 suspension solution was adjusted to 3.1 by dropwise adding 1.2 M of HCl solution.Afterward, 5, 10, 20, 30 mg of HPW were dissolved in deionized water and then added the obtained HPW solution to the g-C 3 N 4 suspension solution with vigorous stirring for 2 h.The weight ratio of HPW to g-C 3 N 4 was determined to be 5, 10, 20, and 30 wt., respectively.Subsequently, the mixture was separated by the centrifugal treatment, and dried at 70 C for 12 h to obtain the g-C 3 N 4 NSs loaded with different amount of HPW.Finally, the HPWloaded g-C 3 N 4 NSs were annealed at 300 C for 2 h under the vacuum condition, thereby synthesizing the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs. The laser particle size and zeta potential analyzer (Zetasizer SZ-100Z, Horiba) was used to measure the surface charge polarity of the samples.The crystallization and the phase transition were studied by X ray diffractometer (XRD; XRD-6000, Shimadzu) with a Cu K line of 0.1541 nm and the radiation is from 10to 80, at a scanning rate at 2/ min.Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were recorded on a Magna 560 FT-IR spectrometer with a resolution of 1 cm -1 .X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on a VG-ESCALAB LKII instrument with a Mg K ADES (h 1253.6eV) source at a residual gas pressure below 10 -8 Pa.The surface topography and sample thickness of as-prepared samples were studied by atomic force microscope (AFM; Bruker Dimension IconTM).The morphology and structure of the as-prepared samples were observed by scanning electron microscope (SEM; S-4800, Hitachi), transmission electron microscopy (TEM; JEM-2100, JEOL).Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out on a NETZSCH STA 449C thermo-analyzer in air.UV-vis absorption spectra were taken with a Lambda 750 UV/Vis/NIR spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer, USA).The specific surface areas of the asprepared samples were measured with a Micromeritics ASAP-2020 instrument and analyzed by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method.Decay curves of the as-prepared samples were obtained on a FLS920 fluorescence lifetime spectrophotometer (Edinburgh Instruments, UK) under the excitation of a hydrogen flash lamp with the wavelength at 325 nm (nF900; Edinburgh Instruments).Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were detected using fluorescence spectrophotometer (F-4600, Hitachi) equipped with a 150 W Xe lamp as the excited light source. 5 mg of the as-synthesized samples, 10 mL triethanolamine (TEOA, 15 vol.), and 10 L chloroplatinic acid (H 2 PtCl 6 , 12 mM) aqueous solution were added in a 35 mL quartz reactor, orderly.Then, the quartz reactor was sealed by a rubber plug, following by ventilation with argon gas for 10 min to drive away the residual air.Subsequently, the reactor was exposed under simulated sunlight (300-W Xe lamp, PLS-SXE300UV coupled with the AM1.5 filter).The gas product composition was periodically analyzed by a gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) (Beifen-Ruili Analytical Instrument, SP-3420A). 10 mg of the Pt-loaded sample was dispersed into 2 mL of deionized water to form a suspension.Then, the above suspension was uniformly dropped onto a 2 cm 2 cm glass substrate.As the water solvent evaporated, the film consisted of the Pt-loaded sample was formed on the glass substrate.Afterwards, the glass with the Pt-loaded sample was put into the 35-mL quartz reactor.Before the irradiation, the reactor was infused with high purity CO 2 for 30 min to degas the residual air.Meanwhile, 0.1 mL of deionized water was injected into the reactor for providing the water vapor.Finally, the reactor loading with the Ptloaded sample was exposed under a 500 W Xe lamp (PLS-SXE300UV).The gas products were periodically analyzed quantitatively by a gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) (Beifen-Ruili Analytical Instrument, SP-3420A). According to the first-principles calculations and analyses, we synthesized the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs through a facile threestep route (Fig. 2A): (i) the synthesis of the g-C 3 N 4 NSs by combining a traditional thermal polymerization method with the followed ultrasonic exfoliation treatment; (ii) the assembly of highly-dispersed HPW clusters onto the surfaces of g-C 3 N 4 NSs based on the electrostatic interaction force between HPW and g-C 3 N 4 ; (iii) the heat treatment of the HPW-adsorbed g-C 3 N 4 NSs to strengthen the chemical bonding at their hetero-interface, and thus obtaining the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs.During the synthesis process, we, at first, adjusted the surface charges of the g-C 3 N 4 NSs into the positive polarity for adsorbing the negatively-charged Keggin units in the aqueous solution.As shown in Fig. S1, the zeta potential of the as-synthesized g-C 3 N 4 NSs depends on pH value of the aqueous solution suspended with g-C 3 N 4 NSs.Particularly, the surface charges of the g-C 3 N 4 NSs could be changed into the positive polarity when the pH value of the suspension solution was adjusted below 4.5.Thus, a homogeneous dissolution of HPW molecules into the above g-C 3 N 4 NSs-suspended solution would induce a self-assembly of highly-dispersed HPW clusters on the surface of the g-C 3 N 4 NSs due to the electrostatic adsorption process between the negatively-charged PW 12 O 40 3-groups of HPW molecules and the positively-charged g-C 3 N 4 NSs.In order to reinforce the hetero-interface quality in the obtained HPW/g-C 3 N 4 composite NSs, the followed heattreatment process was carried out.It could further strengthen the chemical bonding at their hetero-interface, and leading to the formation of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs in the viewpoint of chemical kinetics and solid state physics 23242526. Fig. 2B shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the as-synthesized samples.For the sample of the g-C 3 N 4 NSs, two diffraction peaks appear at 13.1and 27.4, which can be indexed to the (100) and (002) planes of g-C 3 N 4 , respectively 7,8,15,27.For the sample of HPW, the diffraction peaks at 1012, 1622, 2330and 3140a re attributed to the typical HPW with a Keggin structure, which have ever been reported in previous literature 15.However, the characteristic diffraction peaks of HPW could not be observed in the XRD patterns of HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs, even though the mass ratio of HPW to g-C 3 N 4 was increased from 5 wt. to 30 wt..This phenomenon may be attributed to the fact that the ultra-small sized HPW units were highly dispersed on the surface of the g-C 3 N 4 NSs, thereby leading to a poor crystal-diffraction signal beyond the XRD probing limit. In order to ensure the co-existence of HPW and g-C 3 N 4 component in the heterojunction NSs, we investigated the Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of the as-synthesized samples (Fig. 2B,C).For the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs, the peaks located at 3400 cm -1 to 3000 cm -1 are attributed to stretching vibration of -NH 2 and NH amino groups, while several weak peaks ranging from 1700cm -1 to 1120 cm -1 are assigned to the stretching vibration modes of CeN and CN bonds in CN heterocycles.And, the peak at 812 cm -1 is related to the feature vibration mode of s-triazine ring unit 17,28.In the case of HPW, the feature vibration modes of keggin units are located at 1080.1 cm -1 , 981.76 cm -1 , 889.18 cm -1 , and 802.38 cm -1 , which denote the P-O a bonds of the PO 4 tetrahedron, the W O d bonds, and the two W-O b/c -W bonds, respectively 17.After coupling HPW with g-C 3 N 4 , the characteristic vibrational peaks related to both the g-C 3 N 4 NSs and HPW could be found simultaneously on the FT-IR spectrum of the formed HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs.As compared to the pure HPW, the three characteristic peaks related to Keggin units (WO d bonds, and two WeO b/c eW bonds) are shifted to 979.83 cm -1 , 893.04 cm -1 , and 812.03 cm -1 , respectively, on the FT-IR spectrum of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs.This phenomenon suggests the existence of chemical interaction between HPW and g-C 3 N 4 in their heterojunction NSs produced by the static adsorption-deposition method and subsequent vacuum annealing treatment. To determine in-depth the chemical interaction between the HPW and the g-C 3 N 4 components in their heterojunction NSs, the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses of the as-synthesized samples were implemented.As observed in Fig. 3A, three feature peaks, corresponding to sp 2 CeC bonds (284.6 eV), sp 3 -coordinated carbon bonds (285.4 eV), and N-bonded sp 2 C-atom in the s-triazine (NeCN) (287.8 eV) 29,30, can be detected on the C 1s core-level spectrum of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs.However, the feature peaks of the sp 3 -coordinated carbon bonds and the NeCN bonds on the spectrum of the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs shift to the higher binding energy side as compared to the corresponding peaks of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs.In addition, a new peak with the binding energy at around 286.2 eV was observed, which could be ascribed to the formation of CeO bands 31,32.Fig. 3B displays the N 1s core-level spectra of the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs in comparison with the g-C 3 N 4 NSs.It is obvious that the binding energies of the sp 2 -bonded N (CeNC), tertiary nitrogen N-(C) 3 groups, and amino groups (CeNeH) 8,33,34 on the spectrum of the heterojunction NSs are also higher than the corresponding energies on the spectrum of the pure g-C 3 N 4 .The O 1s core-level spectra of the pure HPW and the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs are given in Fig. 3C.The two feature peaks on the spectrum of the pure HPW are originated from to the WeOeW (530.8 eV) and WeOeP/WeOeH bonds (531.9 eV), respectively 17.In the case of 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs, the above two peaks also shift toward the higher binding energy side as compared to the pure HPW.Interestingly, the two new peaks attributed to the CeOeW (532.6 eV) and C(N) 3 -OH (533.7 eV) bonds 17,18,35, can be found on the O 1s core-level spectrum of the heterojunction NSs.The appeared C(N) 3 -OH bonds in the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs could be attributed to the substitution of the amino groups by the hydroxyl groups after the acidizing treatment of g-C 3 N 4 NSs 17,18, thereby leading to the formation of N defects.Meanwhile, the observation of the CeOeW bond is consistent with the DFT calculation results, further confirming that the HPW and g-C 3 N 4 in their heterojunction NSs are linked by the CeOeW bond.Notably, the W 4f 7/2 and W 4f 5/2 peaks of the pure HPW located at 35.8 and 37.9 eV 17,18, respectively, are shifted to the lower binding energy sides after forming the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction (Fig. 3D).According to the previous reports, the binding energy shifts on the XPS spectra of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs can be ascribed to the electron transfer across the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 hetero-interface through the formed CeOeW bond due to the different electron concentration between the two heterocomponents.Additionally, the P 2p core-level signal could be also detected on the XPS spectrum of HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs, as shown in Fig. S3.The binding energy peak centered at 133.8 eV indicates the existence of P 5 in the oxidation state 15,18, which is in agreement with the valence state of P in the HPW.It further demonstrates that the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs were constructed through the self-assembly method based on the static adsorption-deposition process. The aforementioned results confirm the successful synthesis of HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs.To determine the distribution and the size of HPW on the g-C 3 N 4 NSs, the as-synthesized samples were, at first, observed by atomic force microscope (AFM) images (Fig. 4).The g-C 3 N 4 NSs show up the smooth surfaces and layered structure (Fig. 4A).Besides, the thickness is between 3-5 nm (Fig. 4B,C).After combination with HPW, the surfaces of HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs is still flat (Fig. 4D) and the thickness of heterojunction NSs remain between 3-5 nm (Fig. 4E,F), implying the ultra-small size (may be less than 3 nm) and highly-dispersed distribution of the HPW clusters on the surfaces of the g-C 3 N 4 NSs.The morphologies of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs and the single component of g-C 3 N 4 NSs were further observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images.As shown in Fig. 5A, the g-C 3 N 4 exfoliated by the ultrasonic method exhibits a corrugated-sheet structure with smooth surface.After loading HPW clusters onto these exfoliated g-C 3 N 4 NSs through the adsorption-deposition method, the surface of the obtained HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs still remain smooth, as observed by the SEM images in Figs.5B andS2.Surprisingly, no morphology information of HPW clusters was found in both TEM and HRTEM images of HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs (Fig. 5C andD).This may be ascribed to the uniform dispersion of ultra-small sized HPW clusters onto the g-C 3 N 4 NSs.Interestingly, when we employed the HAADF-STEM image to detect the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs in-depth, lots of ultra-small bright dots with a high dispersity could be observed clearly on the surface of the heterojunction NSs (Fig. 5E).These bright dots can be recognized as the heavy element of such W originated from the HPW clusters, because the intensity in the HAADF image depends on the atomic number 36.The above evidence proves that the HPW clusters with sizes less than 2 nm are highly-dispersed on the g-C single hetero-components (Fig. S4).During the TGA testing, the used amounts of the samples are the same.For the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs, the total weight loss between 25 C and 800 C is about 97.2, resulting from the direct thermal decomposition of the g-C 3 N 4 NSs 37.For the pure HPW, there are two steps of mass loss on TGA curve.The first step is a loss of 9.5 between 25 C and 160 C as a result of the weight loss of physical-adsorbed water and crystallization water in HPW.And, the second mass loss of 3.1 between 160 C and 800 C is ascribed to the loss of acidic protons and the decomposition of the Keggin structure 38,39.According to the weight loss of 82.8 in the 20 wt. HPW/ g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs during the heat-treatment, it can be calculated that the actual weight ratio of HPW in the heterojunction NSs is 16.5.Thus, actual mass ratio of HPW to g-C 3 N 4 in the heterojunction NSs is 19.7 wt., which is consistent with the theoretical value (20 wt.) (more calculation details were presented in Supporting information). The light absorption properties of the as-synthesized samples were investigated through UV-vis adsorption spectra, and the corresponding results were shown in Fig. 6 and S5.It can be observed that the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs possess a broad light-absorption range spanning from UV-to visible-light region.However, the pure HPW only displays a UV-light adsorption property.The band gap (E g ) values of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs and HPW were calculated to be 2.75 eV and 3.01 eV, which are consistent with the literatures 12,40.After coupling the g-C 3 N 4 NSs with the HPW clusters, the formed HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs exhibited the blue-shifts of absorption edges as compared to the g-C 3 N 4 NSs.What' more, the blue-shift phenomenon for the absorption edge of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs increased gradually with increasing the HPW content in the NSs (Fig. S5).This result further proves that the ultra-small HPW clusters have been introduced into the g-C 3 N 4 NSs, forming the 2D HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs. Photocatalytic activities of the as-synthesized samples for H 2 generation were evaluated under simulated sunlight irradiation by serving triethanolamine (TEOA) as the sacrificial reagent to slake the photoinduced holes.The H 2 generation rates of the as-synthesized samples are summarized in Fig. 7A.It is showed that the H 2 -generation rate of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs is 6.6 mol h -1 , and the corresponding turnover number (TON) is 110 based on the used amount of Pt co-catalyst (one H 2 molecule per active metal site 41).Meanwhile, the pure HPW is no photoactivity for H 2 generation, which may be attributed to an improper energy-level of its LUMO with respect to that of H reduction potential 12.Notably, the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs show the increased rates of H 2 generation as compared to either the g-C 3 N 4 NSs or HPW hetero-components.It suggests that the static adsorption-deposition of the HPW clusters onto the g-C 3 N 4 NSs can lead to the formation of an effective charge-transfer channel at the intimate interface of the formed HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs, thus hindering the recombination of photoinduced charge-carriers in the g-C 3 N 4 component.Further investigation found that the H 2 generation rate of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs is dominated by the HPW content in the NSs.When the loading amount of HPW was below 20 wt. in the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs, the H 2 -generation rate of the heterojunction NSs increased with increasing the HPW loading.However, a further increase of HPW content (30 wt.) resulted in a decrease of the photocatalytic activity for H 2 generation.This could be ascribed to the fact that the excessive amount of HPW clusters loaded onto the surface of g-C 3 N 4 NSs would shield both the light-absorption and catalytic-active sites nearby the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 hetero-interface regions 28,34,42434445, although a promoted process of charge-transfer may occur in the large-area contact interface between the HPW and g-C 3 N 4 hetero-components.The optimal photocatalytic activity for H 2 generation (14.6 mol h -1 ) was achieved on the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NS (TON 243).Its H 2 -generation rate is 2.2 times higher than that of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs.Please note that only 5 mg of 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs were employed as the photocatalyst for H 2 generation in our work.As shown in Fig. 7B, the H 2 -production yields of all the synthesized g-C 3 N 4 -based samples linearly increase with the irradiation time.After simulated light irradiation for 2 h, the H 2 -generation amount of 20 wt. HPW clusters decorated g-C 3 N 4 NSs could reach 29.2 mol, which is greatly superior to that of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs (12.9 mol).It should be pointed out that after assembling HPW clusters onto the g-C 3 N 4 NSs, the specific-surface-areas of the formed HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs (25.0291 38.5376 m2/g) were similar to that of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs (30.2709 m2/g), as shown in Fig. S6.Thus, we believed that the enhanced photocatalytic activity of HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs for H 2 generation is mainly attributed to the existence of large amounts of uniformly-dispersed and ultra-small sized hetero-interface in the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs.The high-quality hetero-interface of HPW/g-C 3 N 4 with a fascinating molecular-scale structure can not only enhance the interfacial chargetransfer process, but also simultaneously offer abundant light-harvesting and catalytic-active sites at the hetero-interface region, thereby enabling a high-efficient utilization of photoinduced electrons for H 2 generation over the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs. According to the literatures, the energy-band positions of HPW (LUMO and HOMO) and g-C 3 N 4 (VB and CB) are staggered in their heterojunction interface.Thus, there are two possible photoinduced interfacial charge-transfer pathways in the heterojunction NSs (traditional \"type II\" heterojunction or direct Z-scheme mechanism), depending on the Fermi-level positions of the single HPW and g-C 3 N 4 components 464748495051.As shown in Fig. S7, if the Fermi-level of g-C 3 N 4 NSs is higher than that of the HPW, the electrons on the Fermi-level of g-C 3 N 4 NSs will transfer to the Fermi-level of HPW for balancing the Fermi-level of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction system.This electron transfer process creates a built-in electric filed at the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 hetero-interface with the vector direction from the g-C 3 N 4 to HPW sides.In this way, the formed interfacial built-in electric filed would drive \"type II\"-heterojunction charge-transfer process, where the photoinduced electrons transfer from the CB of g-C 3 N 4 to the LUMO of HPW, while the photoinduced holes migrate from the HOMO of HPW to the VB of g-C 3 N 4 .However, the LUMO energy-level of HPW component is below reduction potential of H , leading to photocatalytic inert of HPW for H 2 generation.Thus, the charge transfer process of \"type II\" heterojunction would lead to the decreased photocatalytic performance of HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs.However, this hypothesis is inconsistent with our experimental results.Therefore, we deduce that the contribution of the enhanced photocatalytic activity for HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs comes from the direct Z-scheme mechanism of the To further clarify this issue, we re-tested the photocatalytic activities of the as-synthesized g-C 3 N 4 NSs-based samples for H 2 generation upon visible light irradiation ( 420 nm), because the photon energy at the visible light region could only drive the photoinduced charge-carriers of the g-C 3 N 4 component in the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs.As observed in Fig. 7C, the introduction of photo-inert HPW clusters into g-C 3 N 4 NSs results in the decreased photocatalytic activities of the formed HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs for H 2 generation as compared to the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs.Meanwhile, with increasing the HPW-content from 5 to 30 wt. in the heterojunction NSs, the H 2 generation rate decreased from 3.5 to 2.8 mol h -1 .By combining this observation with the photocatalytic results obtained under simulated light irradiation, we can further confirm the following two aspects: (1) the photoinduced electrons on the LUMO of the HPW clusters are not capable of initiating the proton reduction reaction; (2) the photoinduced electrons on the CB of the g-C 3 N 4 hetero-component are hard to transfer to the HOMO level of the HPW hetero-component, which may be due to the existence of built-in electric-field with the vector direction from the g-C 3 N 4 to the HPW sides at HPW/g-C 3 N 4 hetero-interface for hindering the interfacial electron-transfer process of the \"type II\" heterojunction (Fig. S7).In other word, the built-in electric-field at the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 hetero-interface would drive the photoinduced electron transfer from the LUMO level of HPW heterocomponent to the VB of the g-C 3 N 4 hetero-component, thereby forming the direct Z-scheme mechanism of the photoinduced electron transfer after the excitation of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs. To strengthen the aforementioned conclusion, the spectral dependence of the photocatalytic performance was implemented on the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs along with the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs.As shown in Fig. 7D, upon UV light irradiation (365 and 380 nm), the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs displayed the higher photocatalytic H 2 -generation amount as compared with the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs.However, when the excitation photon energy is lower than the band gap of HPW component, the H 2 -generation amounts over the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs were lower than those of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs.These observations are in accordance with the above analysis results, revealing that the HPW component in the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs can serve as the photo-sensitizer to prolong the lifetimes of the photoinduced electrons on the CB of g-C 3 N 4 component based on the direct Z-scheme process of interfacial electron transfer.Moreover, the wavelength-dependent apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs and the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs can be calculated by the following equation: As shown in Fig. 7E, the curve linked by the AQE values of both the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction and the g-C 3 N 4 NSs are consistent with the results of the their corresponding UV-vis absorption spectra (Fig. 5A), powerfully confirming that the photocatalytic H 2 generation of these NSs are driven by the photoinduced charge-carriers.Notably, the AQE value of the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs (used 5 mg) is estimated as 0.65 under irradiation at 365 nm, which is obviously higher than that of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs.It suggests that although the photocatalytic quantum efficiency of the Z-scheme heterojunction photocatalyst, in theoretical, is only a half of that for the single hetero-components in the photocatalyst, the construction of the Zscheme heterojunction photocatalyst is still an effective strategy to hinder the recombination of photoinduced charge-carriers in the single hetero-components for enhancing photocatalytic solar-to-fuels conversion. Besides, the stability of the optimal as-prepared 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs was investigated through performing a cycling test of simulated sunlight-irradiated catalytic H 2 generation (Fig. S8).After three cycles, the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs maintained 93.1 of its initial photocatalytic activity in the first cycle, indicating a good photocatalytic stability of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs.To further generalize the idea of the enhancement of photoinduced charge-carriers separation from the decorated HPW, we used another photocatalytic reaction, photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with water vapor, as a model system to test the photocatalytic activity of the HPW/ g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs.Control experiments indicated that upon UV-vis light irradiation, there was no CO or CH 4 release in the absence of either CO 2 or the photocatalyst.These results reveal that the gas products were generated from the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction but not from the contaminants.As observed in Fig. 7F and7 G, CO gas is the only product during the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction over the g-C 3 N 4 and HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs photocatalysts.Upon UV-vis light irradiation, the CO-yield rate of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs (3.83 mol g -1 h -1 ) is 6.7 times higher than that of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs (0.56 mol g -1 h -1 ).Furthermore, the CO-yield of assynthesized samples increased with the irradiation time, suggesting the occurrence of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction over the samples.It can be found that the enhancement factor of the photocatalytic activity of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs to the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs in CO 2 reduction (6.7) is much higher than that in the above H 2 generation (2.2).This phenomenon can be explained by the fact that there is only a small proportion of UV light in the simulated sunlight spectrum, thereby leading to a weak excitation behavior of the HPW heterocomponent in the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs during the photocatalytic H 2 generation.When the proportion of UV light was increased in the UV-vis light spectrum (xenon lamp without any filter), the light excitation process of the HPW hetero-component in the heterojunction NSs could be enhanced.Thus, the interfacial charge transfer process in the Z-scheme HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs was further improved to cause the larger enhancement factor of the photocatalytic activity in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction. To further illuminate the Z-scheme mechanism in the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs, the steady-state and transient photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy of the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs were studied in comparison with that of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs.In Fig. 8A, by selecting the excitation wavelength at 325 nm, a strong emission peak at 446 nm is observed on the steady-state PL curve of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs.When these g-C 3 N 4 NSs were combined with the HPW clusters to form the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs, the intensity of emission peak at 446 nm was decreased.The decreased intensity of emission peak could be attributed to the possible existence of two kinds of charge-carrier dynamics processes in the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs: one is the transfer process of the photoinduced electrons from the LUMO of HPW component to the VB of g-C 3 N 4 component to quench the photoinduced holes on the VB of g-C 3 N 4 component; the other is the transfer process of photoinduced electrons from the CB of g-C 3 N 4 component to the LUMO of HPW component.To obtain a better understanding on the transfer process of photoinduced electrons between the g-C 3 N 4 and HPW components in their heterojunction NSs, a multiexponential decay function is used to fit the corresponding time-resolved transient PL spectroscopy.The function could be expressed as following 52: where 1 and 2 are the fluorescent lifetime, and A 1 , and A 2 are the corresponding amplitudes.This result suggests the existence of two different decay channels in the g-C 3 N 4 NSs after 325 nm excitation.As observed in the insets of Fig. 8B andC, the time constant ( 1 ) of the fast decay process is 2.19 ns for the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs, which is shorter than that of the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs (3.06 ns).This fast decay process is caused by the non-radiative recombination of photoinduced charge-carriers in the defect states of g-C 3 N 4 42,53,54. What's more, the time constant ( 2 ) of the slow decay process is originated from the radiative recombination of the free excitations in g-C 3 N 4 42,53,54.It can be found that the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs still possesses a longer lifetime (16.72 ns) than that of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs (10.48 ns).The average emission lifetimes of the above two samples can be calculated via the following equation 55: The results indicate that the average lifetime of g-C 3 N 4 NSs is extended from 6.78 ns to 8.94 ns after loading with the HPW clusters.This result provides a solid evidence to prove the fact that the dynamics process of the photoinduced charge-transfer across the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 hetero-interface followed the Z-scheme mechanism rather than the traditional \"type II\" heterojunction mechanism.According to the energy band structures of HPW and g-C 3 N 4 12, it could be deduced that in the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs, the photoinduced electrons on the LUMO of HPW transfer to the VB of g-C 3 N 4 to combine with the photoinduced holes on the g-C 3 N 4 side. To further elucidate the Z-scheme enhanced of photocatalytic activity of HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs for the solar-to-fuels conversion, the photoinduced charge-carriers transfer process in these heterojunction NSs is illustrated in Fig. 8D.Upon UV-vis light irradiation, the HPW clusters and the g-C 3 N 4 NSs in their heterojunction NSs are excited simultaneously.Then, the photoinduced electrons on the LUMO of the HPW component can transfer to VB of the g-C 3 N 4 component to quench its photoinduced holes, thereby greatly extending the lifetime of the photoinduced electrons on the CB of g-C 3 N 4 .Afterwards, these photoinduced electrons are further trapped by the co-catalysts of Pt nanoparticles to lower down their over-potentials for reducing the protons into H 2 and reducing CO 2 into CO, respectively 16,56.Meanwhile, the photoinduced holes remained at the HOMO of HPW component are capable of implementing some oxidation reaction in the presence of appropriate electron donors, for instance, TEOA for the H 2 generation and water for the CO 2 reduction in the our current study.According to the literatures 57,58, the possible pathway for CO 2 reduction on the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs may go through as follows: CO 2 (g) CO 2 (1) CO 2 e - H COOH COOH e - H CO H 2 O (4) CO CO (5) where \"\" represents the corresponding adsorption state on the catalyst surface.During the process of CO 2 reduction, the Z-scheme transfer mechanism of photoinduced charge-carriers could result in the enhanced separation of photoinduced charge-carriers in the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs to promote the photocatalytic activity of CO 2 reduction.However, when the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs were under visible irradiation, the interband transition of HPW is forbidden.This leads to no available photo-induced electrons on the LUMO of HPW for quenching the photoinduced holes of the g-C 3 N 4 NSs.Meanwhile, the built-in electric field at the interface HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction also hinders the transfer process of the photoinduced electron from the CB of the g-C 3 N 4 component to the LUMO of the HPW component, as illustrated in Fig. S7.In this way, the photocatalytic inert component of such HPW (for H 2 generation and CO 2 reduction) would shield the photocatalytic reaction sites of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs.Thus, the visible-light photocatalytic performance of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs decreases as the increase of loading amount of the HPW clusters on the g-C 3 N 4 NSs. In summary, we have successfully synthesized a Z-scheme photocatalyst with the molecular-scale hetero-interface through self-assembly of ultra-small HPW clusters onto g-C 3 N 4 NSs via a facile static adsorption-deposition method.The HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs possesses significant enhancements for both photocatalytic H 2 generation and CO 2 reduction based on the unique synergistic photocatalysis effect between the abundant surface active-sites, the high hetero-interface quality, as well as the Z-scheme-improved charge-carriers separation process.The as-synthesized 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heteojunction NSs exhibited 2.2 and 6.7 folds on photocatalytic H 2 generation and CO 2 reduction, respectively, as compared to the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs, even though the pure HPW component was photocatalytic-inert for either H 2 generation or CO 2 reduction upon UV-vis light irradiation.It is anticipated that the designed HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs may provide new insights for exploring molecular-scale heteropolyacid-decorated 2D layered Z-scheme photocatalysts with high hetero-interface quality and abundant active-sites for photocatalytic solar-to-fuels conversion.

The g-C 3 N 4 was prepared by a traditional thermal polymerization method.Typically, 10 g of carbamide powder was lapped for 60 min in a mortar and then transferred to a 50 mL alumina crucible with a cover.Subsequently, the crucible was heated to 550 C with a rising rate of 18 C/min and kept for 2 h at 550 C, thereby obtaining the g-C 3 N 4 bulk with faint-yellow color. Typically, 100 mg g-C 3 N 4 bulk was ultrasonically dispersed into the deionized water to form the suspension solution of g-C 3 N 4 NSs.Then, the pH value of g-C 3 N 4 suspension solution was adjusted to 3.1 by dropwise adding 1.2 M of HCl solution.Afterward, 5, 10, 20, 30 mg of HPW were dissolved in deionized water and then added the obtained HPW solution to the g-C 3 N 4 suspension solution with vigorous stirring for 2 h.The weight ratio of HPW to g-C 3 N 4 was determined to be 5, 10, 20, and 30 wt., respectively.Subsequently, the mixture was separated by the centrifugal treatment, and dried at 70 C for 12 h to obtain the g-C 3 N 4 NSs loaded with different amount of HPW.Finally, the HPWloaded g-C 3 N 4 NSs were annealed at 300 C for 2 h under the vacuum condition, thereby synthesizing the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs. The laser particle size and zeta potential analyzer (Zetasizer SZ-100Z, Horiba) was used to measure the surface charge polarity of the samples.The crystallization and the phase transition were studied by X ray diffractometer (XRD; XRD-6000, Shimadzu) with a Cu K line of 0.1541 nm and the radiation is from 10to 80, at a scanning rate at 2/ min.Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were recorded on a Magna 560 FT-IR spectrometer with a resolution of 1 cm -1 .X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on a VG-ESCALAB LKII instrument with a Mg K ADES (h 1253.6eV) source at a residual gas pressure below 10 -8 Pa.The surface topography and sample thickness of as-prepared samples were studied by atomic force microscope (AFM; Bruker Dimension IconTM).The morphology and structure of the as-prepared samples were observed by scanning electron microscope (SEM; S-4800, Hitachi), transmission electron microscopy (TEM; JEM-2100, JEOL).Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out on a NETZSCH STA 449C thermo-analyzer in air.UV-vis absorption spectra were taken with a Lambda 750 UV/Vis/NIR spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer, USA).The specific surface areas of the asprepared samples were measured with a Micromeritics ASAP-2020 instrument and analyzed by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method.Decay curves of the as-prepared samples were obtained on a FLS920 fluorescence lifetime spectrophotometer (Edinburgh Instruments, UK) under the excitation of a hydrogen flash lamp with the wavelength at 325 nm (nF900; Edinburgh Instruments).Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were detected using fluorescence spectrophotometer (F-4600, Hitachi) equipped with a 150 W Xe lamp as the excited light source. 5 mg of the as-synthesized samples, 10 mL triethanolamine (TEOA, 15 vol.), and 10 L chloroplatinic acid (H 2 PtCl 6 , 12 mM) aqueous solution were added in a 35 mL quartz reactor, orderly.Then, the quartz reactor was sealed by a rubber plug, following by ventilation with argon gas for 10 min to drive away the residual air.Subsequently, the reactor was exposed under simulated sunlight (300-W Xe lamp, PLS-SXE300UV coupled with the AM1.5 filter).The gas product composition was periodically analyzed by a gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) (Beifen-Ruili Analytical Instrument, SP-3420A). 10 mg of the Pt-loaded sample was dispersed into 2 mL of deionized water to form a suspension.Then, the above suspension was uniformly dropped onto a 2 cm 2 cm glass substrate.As the water solvent evaporated, the film consisted of the Pt-loaded sample was formed on the glass substrate.Afterwards, the glass with the Pt-loaded sample was put into the 35-mL quartz reactor.Before the irradiation, the reactor was infused with high purity CO 2 for 30 min to degas the residual air.Meanwhile, 0.1 mL of deionized water was injected into the reactor for providing the water vapor.Finally, the reactor loading with the Ptloaded sample was exposed under a 500 W Xe lamp (PLS-SXE300UV).The gas products were periodically analyzed quantitatively by a gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) (Beifen-Ruili Analytical Instrument, SP-3420A). According to the first-principles calculations and analyses, we synthesized the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs through a facile threestep route (Fig. 2A): (i) the synthesis of the g-C 3 N 4 NSs by combining a traditional thermal polymerization method with the followed ultrasonic exfoliation treatment; (ii) the assembly of highly-dispersed HPW clusters onto the surfaces of g-C 3 N 4 NSs based on the electrostatic interaction force between HPW and g-C 3 N 4 ; (iii) the heat treatment of the HPW-adsorbed g-C 3 N 4 NSs to strengthen the chemical bonding at their hetero-interface, and thus obtaining the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs.During the synthesis process, we, at first, adjusted the surface charges of the g-C 3 N 4 NSs into the positive polarity for adsorbing the negatively-charged Keggin units in the aqueous solution.As shown in Fig. S1, the zeta potential of the as-synthesized g-C 3 N 4 NSs depends on pH value of the aqueous solution suspended with g-C 3 N 4 NSs.Particularly, the surface charges of the g-C 3 N 4 NSs could be changed into the positive polarity when the pH value of the suspension solution was adjusted below 4.5.Thus, a homogeneous dissolution of HPW molecules into the above g-C 3 N 4 NSs-suspended solution would induce a self-assembly of highly-dispersed HPW clusters on the surface of the g-C 3 N 4 NSs due to the electrostatic adsorption process between the negatively-charged PW 12 O 40 3-groups of HPW molecules and the positively-charged g-C 3 N 4 NSs.In order to reinforce the hetero-interface quality in the obtained HPW/g-C 3 N 4 composite NSs, the followed heattreatment process was carried out.It could further strengthen the chemical bonding at their hetero-interface, and leading to the formation of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs in the viewpoint of chemical kinetics and solid state physics 23242526. Fig. 2B shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the as-synthesized samples.For the sample of the g-C 3 N 4 NSs, two diffraction peaks appear at 13.1and 27.4, which can be indexed to the (100) and (002) planes of g-C 3 N 4 , respectively 7,8,15,27.For the sample of HPW, the diffraction peaks at 1012, 1622, 2330and 3140a re attributed to the typical HPW with a Keggin structure, which have ever been reported in previous literature 15.However, the characteristic diffraction peaks of HPW could not be observed in the XRD patterns of HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs, even though the mass ratio of HPW to g-C 3 N 4 was increased from 5 wt. to 30 wt..This phenomenon may be attributed to the fact that the ultra-small sized HPW units were highly dispersed on the surface of the g-C 3 N 4 NSs, thereby leading to a poor crystal-diffraction signal beyond the XRD probing limit. In order to ensure the co-existence of HPW and g-C 3 N 4 component in the heterojunction NSs, we investigated the Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of the as-synthesized samples (Fig. 2B,C).For the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs, the peaks located at 3400 cm -1 to 3000 cm -1 are attributed to stretching vibration of -NH 2 and NH amino groups, while several weak peaks ranging from 1700cm -1 to 1120 cm -1 are assigned to the stretching vibration modes of CeN and CN bonds in CN heterocycles.And, the peak at 812 cm -1 is related to the feature vibration mode of s-triazine ring unit 17,28.In the case of HPW, the feature vibration modes of keggin units are located at 1080.1 cm -1 , 981.76 cm -1 , 889.18 cm -1 , and 802.38 cm -1 , which denote the P-O a bonds of the PO 4 tetrahedron, the W O d bonds, and the two W-O b/c -W bonds, respectively 17.After coupling HPW with g-C 3 N 4 , the characteristic vibrational peaks related to both the g-C 3 N 4 NSs and HPW could be found simultaneously on the FT-IR spectrum of the formed HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs.As compared to the pure HPW, the three characteristic peaks related to Keggin units (WO d bonds, and two WeO b/c eW bonds) are shifted to 979.83 cm -1 , 893.04 cm -1 , and 812.03 cm -1 , respectively, on the FT-IR spectrum of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs.This phenomenon suggests the existence of chemical interaction between HPW and g-C 3 N 4 in their heterojunction NSs produced by the static adsorption-deposition method and subsequent vacuum annealing treatment. To determine in-depth the chemical interaction between the HPW and the g-C 3 N 4 components in their heterojunction NSs, the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses of the as-synthesized samples were implemented.As observed in Fig. 3A, three feature peaks, corresponding to sp 2 CeC bonds (284.6 eV), sp 3 -coordinated carbon bonds (285.4 eV), and N-bonded sp 2 C-atom in the s-triazine (NeCN) (287.8 eV) 29,30, can be detected on the C 1s core-level spectrum of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs.However, the feature peaks of the sp 3 -coordinated carbon bonds and the NeCN bonds on the spectrum of the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs shift to the higher binding energy side as compared to the corresponding peaks of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs.In addition, a new peak with the binding energy at around 286.2 eV was observed, which could be ascribed to the formation of CeO bands 31,32.Fig. 3B displays the N 1s core-level spectra of the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs in comparison with the g-C 3 N 4 NSs.It is obvious that the binding energies of the sp 2 -bonded N (CeNC), tertiary nitrogen N-(C) 3 groups, and amino groups (CeNeH) 8,33,34 on the spectrum of the heterojunction NSs are also higher than the corresponding energies on the spectrum of the pure g-C 3 N 4 .The O 1s core-level spectra of the pure HPW and the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs are given in Fig. 3C.The two feature peaks on the spectrum of the pure HPW are originated from to the WeOeW (530.8 eV) and WeOeP/WeOeH bonds (531.9 eV), respectively 17.In the case of 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs, the above two peaks also shift toward the higher binding energy side as compared to the pure HPW.Interestingly, the two new peaks attributed to the CeOeW (532.6 eV) and C(N) 3 -OH (533.7 eV) bonds 17,18,35, can be found on the O 1s core-level spectrum of the heterojunction NSs.The appeared C(N) 3 -OH bonds in the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs could be attributed to the substitution of the amino groups by the hydroxyl groups after the acidizing treatment of g-C 3 N 4 NSs 17,18, thereby leading to the formation of N defects.Meanwhile, the observation of the CeOeW bond is consistent with the DFT calculation results, further confirming that the HPW and g-C 3 N 4 in their heterojunction NSs are linked by the CeOeW bond.Notably, the W 4f 7/2 and W 4f 5/2 peaks of the pure HPW located at 35.8 and 37.9 eV 17,18, respectively, are shifted to the lower binding energy sides after forming the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction (Fig. 3D).According to the previous reports, the binding energy shifts on the XPS spectra of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs can be ascribed to the electron transfer across the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 hetero-interface through the formed CeOeW bond due to the different electron concentration between the two heterocomponents.Additionally, the P 2p core-level signal could be also detected on the XPS spectrum of HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs, as shown in Fig. S3.The binding energy peak centered at 133.8 eV indicates the existence of P 5 in the oxidation state 15,18, which is in agreement with the valence state of P in the HPW.It further demonstrates that the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs were constructed through the self-assembly method based on the static adsorption-deposition process. The aforementioned results confirm the successful synthesis of HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs.To determine the distribution and the size of HPW on the g-C 3 N 4 NSs, the as-synthesized samples were, at first, observed by atomic force microscope (AFM) images (Fig. 4).The g-C 3 N 4 NSs show up the smooth surfaces and layered structure (Fig. 4A).Besides, the thickness is between 3-5 nm (Fig. 4B,C).After combination with HPW, the surfaces of HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs is still flat (Fig. 4D) and the thickness of heterojunction NSs remain between 3-5 nm (Fig. 4E,F), implying the ultra-small size (may be less than 3 nm) and highly-dispersed distribution of the HPW clusters on the surfaces of the g-C 3 N 4 NSs.The morphologies of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs and the single component of g-C 3 N 4 NSs were further observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images.As shown in Fig. 5A, the g-C 3 N 4 exfoliated by the ultrasonic method exhibits a corrugated-sheet structure with smooth surface.After loading HPW clusters onto these exfoliated g-C 3 N 4 NSs through the adsorption-deposition method, the surface of the obtained HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs still remain smooth, as observed by the SEM images in Figs.5B andS2.Surprisingly, no morphology information of HPW clusters was found in both TEM and HRTEM images of HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs (Fig. 5C andD).This may be ascribed to the uniform dispersion of ultra-small sized HPW clusters onto the g-C 3 N 4 NSs.Interestingly, when we employed the HAADF-STEM image to detect the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs in-depth, lots of ultra-small bright dots with a high dispersity could be observed clearly on the surface of the heterojunction NSs (Fig. 5E).These bright dots can be recognized as the heavy element of such W originated from the HPW clusters, because the intensity in the HAADF image depends on the atomic number 36.The above evidence proves that the HPW clusters with sizes less than 2 nm are highly-dispersed on the g-C single hetero-components (Fig. S4).During the TGA testing, the used amounts of the samples are the same.For the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs, the total weight loss between 25 C and 800 C is about 97.2, resulting from the direct thermal decomposition of the g-C 3 N 4 NSs 37.For the pure HPW, there are two steps of mass loss on TGA curve.The first step is a loss of 9.5 between 25 C and 160 C as a result of the weight loss of physical-adsorbed water and crystallization water in HPW.And, the second mass loss of 3.1 between 160 C and 800 C is ascribed to the loss of acidic protons and the decomposition of the Keggin structure 38,39.According to the weight loss of 82.8 in the 20 wt. HPW/ g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs during the heat-treatment, it can be calculated that the actual weight ratio of HPW in the heterojunction NSs is 16.5.Thus, actual mass ratio of HPW to g-C 3 N 4 in the heterojunction NSs is 19.7 wt., which is consistent with the theoretical value (20 wt.) (more calculation details were presented in Supporting information). The light absorption properties of the as-synthesized samples were investigated through UV-vis adsorption spectra, and the corresponding results were shown in Fig. 6 and S5.It can be observed that the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs possess a broad light-absorption range spanning from UV-to visible-light region.However, the pure HPW only displays a UV-light adsorption property.The band gap (E g ) values of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs and HPW were calculated to be 2.75 eV and 3.01 eV, which are consistent with the literatures 12,40.After coupling the g-C 3 N 4 NSs with the HPW clusters, the formed HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs exhibited the blue-shifts of absorption edges as compared to the g-C 3 N 4 NSs.What' more, the blue-shift phenomenon for the absorption edge of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs increased gradually with increasing the HPW content in the NSs (Fig. S5).This result further proves that the ultra-small HPW clusters have been introduced into the g-C 3 N 4 NSs, forming the 2D HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs. Photocatalytic activities of the as-synthesized samples for H 2 generation were evaluated under simulated sunlight irradiation by serving triethanolamine (TEOA) as the sacrificial reagent to slake the photoinduced holes.The H 2 generation rates of the as-synthesized samples are summarized in Fig. 7A.It is showed that the H 2 -generation rate of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs is 6.6 mol h -1 , and the corresponding turnover number (TON) is 110 based on the used amount of Pt co-catalyst (one H 2 molecule per active metal site 41).Meanwhile, the pure HPW is no photoactivity for H 2 generation, which may be attributed to an improper energy-level of its LUMO with respect to that of H reduction potential 12.Notably, the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs show the increased rates of H 2 generation as compared to either the g-C 3 N 4 NSs or HPW hetero-components.It suggests that the static adsorption-deposition of the HPW clusters onto the g-C 3 N 4 NSs can lead to the formation of an effective charge-transfer channel at the intimate interface of the formed HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs, thus hindering the recombination of photoinduced charge-carriers in the g-C 3 N 4 component.Further investigation found that the H 2 generation rate of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs is dominated by the HPW content in the NSs.When the loading amount of HPW was below 20 wt. in the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs, the H 2 -generation rate of the heterojunction NSs increased with increasing the HPW loading.However, a further increase of HPW content (30 wt.) resulted in a decrease of the photocatalytic activity for H 2 generation.This could be ascribed to the fact that the excessive amount of HPW clusters loaded onto the surface of g-C 3 N 4 NSs would shield both the light-absorption and catalytic-active sites nearby the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 hetero-interface regions 28,34,42434445, although a promoted process of charge-transfer may occur in the large-area contact interface between the HPW and g-C 3 N 4 hetero-components.The optimal photocatalytic activity for H 2 generation (14.6 mol h -1 ) was achieved on the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NS (TON 243).Its H 2 -generation rate is 2.2 times higher than that of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs.Please note that only 5 mg of 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs were employed as the photocatalyst for H 2 generation in our work.As shown in Fig. 7B, the H 2 -production yields of all the synthesized g-C 3 N 4 -based samples linearly increase with the irradiation time.After simulated light irradiation for 2 h, the H 2 -generation amount of 20 wt. HPW clusters decorated g-C 3 N 4 NSs could reach 29.2 mol, which is greatly superior to that of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs (12.9 mol).It should be pointed out that after assembling HPW clusters onto the g-C 3 N 4 NSs, the specific-surface-areas of the formed HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs (25.0291 38.5376 m2/g) were similar to that of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs (30.2709 m2/g), as shown in Fig. S6.Thus, we believed that the enhanced photocatalytic activity of HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs for H 2 generation is mainly attributed to the existence of large amounts of uniformly-dispersed and ultra-small sized hetero-interface in the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs.The high-quality hetero-interface of HPW/g-C 3 N 4 with a fascinating molecular-scale structure can not only enhance the interfacial chargetransfer process, but also simultaneously offer abundant light-harvesting and catalytic-active sites at the hetero-interface region, thereby enabling a high-efficient utilization of photoinduced electrons for H 2 generation over the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs. According to the literatures, the energy-band positions of HPW (LUMO and HOMO) and g-C 3 N 4 (VB and CB) are staggered in their heterojunction interface.Thus, there are two possible photoinduced interfacial charge-transfer pathways in the heterojunction NSs (traditional \"type II\" heterojunction or direct Z-scheme mechanism), depending on the Fermi-level positions of the single HPW and g-C 3 N 4 components 464748495051.As shown in Fig. S7, if the Fermi-level of g-C 3 N 4 NSs is higher than that of the HPW, the electrons on the Fermi-level of g-C 3 N 4 NSs will transfer to the Fermi-level of HPW for balancing the Fermi-level of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction system.This electron transfer process creates a built-in electric filed at the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 hetero-interface with the vector direction from the g-C 3 N 4 to HPW sides.In this way, the formed interfacial built-in electric filed would drive \"type II\"-heterojunction charge-transfer process, where the photoinduced electrons transfer from the CB of g-C 3 N 4 to the LUMO of HPW, while the photoinduced holes migrate from the HOMO of HPW to the VB of g-C 3 N 4 .However, the LUMO energy-level of HPW component is below reduction potential of H , leading to photocatalytic inert of HPW for H 2 generation.Thus, the charge transfer process of \"type II\" heterojunction would lead to the decreased photocatalytic performance of HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs.However, this hypothesis is inconsistent with our experimental results.Therefore, we deduce that the contribution of the enhanced photocatalytic activity for HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs comes from the direct Z-scheme mechanism of the To further clarify this issue, we re-tested the photocatalytic activities of the as-synthesized g-C 3 N 4 NSs-based samples for H 2 generation upon visible light irradiation ( 420 nm), because the photon energy at the visible light region could only drive the photoinduced charge-carriers of the g-C 3 N 4 component in the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs.As observed in Fig. 7C, the introduction of photo-inert HPW clusters into g-C 3 N 4 NSs results in the decreased photocatalytic activities of the formed HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs for H 2 generation as compared to the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs.Meanwhile, with increasing the HPW-content from 5 to 30 wt. in the heterojunction NSs, the H 2 generation rate decreased from 3.5 to 2.8 mol h -1 .By combining this observation with the photocatalytic results obtained under simulated light irradiation, we can further confirm the following two aspects: (1) the photoinduced electrons on the LUMO of the HPW clusters are not capable of initiating the proton reduction reaction; (2) the photoinduced electrons on the CB of the g-C 3 N 4 hetero-component are hard to transfer to the HOMO level of the HPW hetero-component, which may be due to the existence of built-in electric-field with the vector direction from the g-C 3 N 4 to the HPW sides at HPW/g-C 3 N 4 hetero-interface for hindering the interfacial electron-transfer process of the \"type II\" heterojunction (Fig. S7).In other word, the built-in electric-field at the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 hetero-interface would drive the photoinduced electron transfer from the LUMO level of HPW heterocomponent to the VB of the g-C 3 N 4 hetero-component, thereby forming the direct Z-scheme mechanism of the photoinduced electron transfer after the excitation of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs. To strengthen the aforementioned conclusion, the spectral dependence of the photocatalytic performance was implemented on the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs along with the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs.As shown in Fig. 7D, upon UV light irradiation (365 and 380 nm), the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs displayed the higher photocatalytic H 2 -generation amount as compared with the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs.However, when the excitation photon energy is lower than the band gap of HPW component, the H 2 -generation amounts over the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs were lower than those of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs.These observations are in accordance with the above analysis results, revealing that the HPW component in the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs can serve as the photo-sensitizer to prolong the lifetimes of the photoinduced electrons on the CB of g-C 3 N 4 component based on the direct Z-scheme process of interfacial electron transfer.Moreover, the wavelength-dependent apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs and the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs can be calculated by the following equation: As shown in Fig. 7E, the curve linked by the AQE values of both the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction and the g-C 3 N 4 NSs are consistent with the results of the their corresponding UV-vis absorption spectra (Fig. 5A), powerfully confirming that the photocatalytic H 2 generation of these NSs are driven by the photoinduced charge-carriers.Notably, the AQE value of the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs (used 5 mg) is estimated as 0.65 under irradiation at 365 nm, which is obviously higher than that of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs.It suggests that although the photocatalytic quantum efficiency of the Z-scheme heterojunction photocatalyst, in theoretical, is only a half of that for the single hetero-components in the photocatalyst, the construction of the Zscheme heterojunction photocatalyst is still an effective strategy to hinder the recombination of photoinduced charge-carriers in the single hetero-components for enhancing photocatalytic solar-to-fuels conversion. Besides, the stability of the optimal as-prepared 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs was investigated through performing a cycling test of simulated sunlight-irradiated catalytic H 2 generation (Fig. S8).After three cycles, the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs maintained 93.1 of its initial photocatalytic activity in the first cycle, indicating a good photocatalytic stability of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs.To further generalize the idea of the enhancement of photoinduced charge-carriers separation from the decorated HPW, we used another photocatalytic reaction, photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with water vapor, as a model system to test the photocatalytic activity of the HPW/ g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs.Control experiments indicated that upon UV-vis light irradiation, there was no CO or CH 4 release in the absence of either CO 2 or the photocatalyst.These results reveal that the gas products were generated from the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction but not from the contaminants.As observed in Fig. 7F and7 G, CO gas is the only product during the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction over the g-C 3 N 4 and HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs photocatalysts.Upon UV-vis light irradiation, the CO-yield rate of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs (3.83 mol g -1 h -1 ) is 6.7 times higher than that of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs (0.56 mol g -1 h -1 ).Furthermore, the CO-yield of assynthesized samples increased with the irradiation time, suggesting the occurrence of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction over the samples.It can be found that the enhancement factor of the photocatalytic activity of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs to the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs in CO 2 reduction (6.7) is much higher than that in the above H 2 generation (2.2).This phenomenon can be explained by the fact that there is only a small proportion of UV light in the simulated sunlight spectrum, thereby leading to a weak excitation behavior of the HPW heterocomponent in the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs during the photocatalytic H 2 generation.When the proportion of UV light was increased in the UV-vis light spectrum (xenon lamp without any filter), the light excitation process of the HPW hetero-component in the heterojunction NSs could be enhanced.Thus, the interfacial charge transfer process in the Z-scheme HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs was further improved to cause the larger enhancement factor of the photocatalytic activity in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction. To further illuminate the Z-scheme mechanism in the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs, the steady-state and transient photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy of the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs were studied in comparison with that of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs.In Fig. 8A, by selecting the excitation wavelength at 325 nm, a strong emission peak at 446 nm is observed on the steady-state PL curve of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs.When these g-C 3 N 4 NSs were combined with the HPW clusters to form the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs, the intensity of emission peak at 446 nm was decreased.The decreased intensity of emission peak could be attributed to the possible existence of two kinds of charge-carrier dynamics processes in the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs: one is the transfer process of the photoinduced electrons from the LUMO of HPW component to the VB of g-C 3 N 4 component to quench the photoinduced holes on the VB of g-C 3 N 4 component; the other is the transfer process of photoinduced electrons from the CB of g-C 3 N 4 component to the LUMO of HPW component.To obtain a better understanding on the transfer process of photoinduced electrons between the g-C 3 N 4 and HPW components in their heterojunction NSs, a multiexponential decay function is used to fit the corresponding time-resolved transient PL spectroscopy.The function could be expressed as following 52: where 1 and 2 are the fluorescent lifetime, and A 1 , and A 2 are the corresponding amplitudes.This result suggests the existence of two different decay channels in the g-C 3 N 4 NSs after 325 nm excitation.As observed in the insets of Fig. 8B andC, the time constant ( 1 ) of the fast decay process is 2.19 ns for the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs, which is shorter than that of the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs (3.06 ns).This fast decay process is caused by the non-radiative recombination of photoinduced charge-carriers in the defect states of g-C 3 N 4 42,53,54. What's more, the time constant ( 2 ) of the slow decay process is originated from the radiative recombination of the free excitations in g-C 3 N 4 42,53,54.It can be found that the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs still possesses a longer lifetime (16.72 ns) than that of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs (10.48 ns).The average emission lifetimes of the above two samples can be calculated via the following equation 55: The results indicate that the average lifetime of g-C 3 N 4 NSs is extended from 6.78 ns to 8.94 ns after loading with the HPW clusters.This result provides a solid evidence to prove the fact that the dynamics process of the photoinduced charge-transfer across the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 hetero-interface followed the Z-scheme mechanism rather than the traditional \"type II\" heterojunction mechanism.According to the energy band structures of HPW and g-C 3 N 4 12, it could be deduced that in the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs, the photoinduced electrons on the LUMO of HPW transfer to the VB of g-C 3 N 4 to combine with the photoinduced holes on the g-C 3 N 4 side. To further elucidate the Z-scheme enhanced of photocatalytic activity of HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs for the solar-to-fuels conversion, the photoinduced charge-carriers transfer process in these heterojunction NSs is illustrated in Fig. 8D.Upon UV-vis light irradiation, the HPW clusters and the g-C 3 N 4 NSs in their heterojunction NSs are excited simultaneously.Then, the photoinduced electrons on the LUMO of the HPW component can transfer to VB of the g-C 3 N 4 component to quench its photoinduced holes, thereby greatly extending the lifetime of the photoinduced electrons on the CB of g-C 3 N 4 .Afterwards, these photoinduced electrons are further trapped by the co-catalysts of Pt nanoparticles to lower down their over-potentials for reducing the protons into H 2 and reducing CO 2 into CO, respectively 16,56.Meanwhile, the photoinduced holes remained at the HOMO of HPW component are capable of implementing some oxidation reaction in the presence of appropriate electron donors, for instance, TEOA for the H 2 generation and water for the CO 2 reduction in the our current study.According to the literatures 57,58, the possible pathway for CO 2 reduction on the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs may go through as follows: CO 2 (g) CO 2 (1) CO 2 e - H COOH COOH e - H CO H 2 O (4) CO CO (5) where \"\" represents the corresponding adsorption state on the catalyst surface.During the process of CO 2 reduction, the Z-scheme transfer mechanism of photoinduced charge-carriers could result in the enhanced separation of photoinduced charge-carriers in the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs to promote the photocatalytic activity of CO 2 reduction.However, when the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs were under visible irradiation, the interband transition of HPW is forbidden.This leads to no available photo-induced electrons on the LUMO of HPW for quenching the photoinduced holes of the g-C 3 N 4 NSs.Meanwhile, the built-in electric field at the interface HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction also hinders the transfer process of the photoinduced electron from the CB of the g-C 3 N 4 component to the LUMO of the HPW component, as illustrated in Fig. S7.In this way, the photocatalytic inert component of such HPW (for H 2 generation and CO 2 reduction) would shield the photocatalytic reaction sites of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs.Thus, the visible-light photocatalytic performance of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs decreases as the increase of loading amount of the HPW clusters on the g-C 3 N 4 NSs. In summary, we have successfully synthesized a Z-scheme photocatalyst with the molecular-scale hetero-interface through self-assembly of ultra-small HPW clusters onto g-C 3 N 4 NSs via a facile static adsorption-deposition method.The HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs possesses significant enhancements for both photocatalytic H 2 generation and CO 2 reduction based on the unique synergistic photocatalysis effect between the abundant surface active-sites, the high hetero-interface quality, as well as the Z-scheme-improved charge-carriers separation process.The as-synthesized 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heteojunction NSs exhibited 2.2 and 6.7 folds on photocatalytic H 2 generation and CO 2 reduction, respectively, as compared to the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs, even though the pure HPW component was photocatalytic-inert for either H 2 generation or CO 2 reduction upon UV-vis light irradiation.It is anticipated that the designed HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs may provide new insights for exploring molecular-scale heteropolyacid-decorated 2D layered Z-scheme photocatalysts with high hetero-interface quality and abundant active-sites for photocatalytic solar-to-fuels conversion.

The g-C 3 N 4 was prepared by a traditional thermal polymerization method.Typically, 10 g of carbamide powder was lapped for 60 min in a mortar and then transferred to a 50 mL alumina crucible with a cover.Subsequently, the crucible was heated to 550 C with a rising rate of 18 C/min and kept for 2 h at 550 C, thereby obtaining the g-C 3 N 4 bulk with faint-yellow color. Typically, 100 mg g-C 3 N 4 bulk was ultrasonically dispersed into the deionized water to form the suspension solution of g-C 3 N 4 NSs.Then, the pH value of g-C 3 N 4 suspension solution was adjusted to 3.1 by dropwise adding 1.2 M of HCl solution.Afterward, 5, 10, 20, 30 mg of HPW were dissolved in deionized water and then added the obtained HPW solution to the g-C 3 N 4 suspension solution with vigorous stirring for 2 h.The weight ratio of HPW to g-C 3 N 4 was determined to be 5, 10, 20, and 30 wt., respectively.Subsequently, the mixture was separated by the centrifugal treatment, and dried at 70 C for 12 h to obtain the g-C 3 N 4 NSs loaded with different amount of HPW.Finally, the HPWloaded g-C 3 N 4 NSs were annealed at 300 C for 2 h under the vacuum condition, thereby synthesizing the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs. The laser particle size and zeta potential analyzer (Zetasizer SZ-100Z, Horiba) was used to measure the surface charge polarity of the samples.The crystallization and the phase transition were studied by X ray diffractometer (XRD; XRD-6000, Shimadzu) with a Cu K line of 0.1541 nm and the radiation is from 10to 80, at a scanning rate at 2/ min.Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were recorded on a Magna 560 FT-IR spectrometer with a resolution of 1 cm -1 .X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on a VG-ESCALAB LKII instrument with a Mg K ADES (h 1253.6eV) source at a residual gas pressure below 10 -8 Pa.The surface topography and sample thickness of as-prepared samples were studied by atomic force microscope (AFM; Bruker Dimension IconTM).The morphology and structure of the as-prepared samples were observed by scanning electron microscope (SEM; S-4800, Hitachi), transmission electron microscopy (TEM; JEM-2100, JEOL).Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out on a NETZSCH STA 449C thermo-analyzer in air.UV-vis absorption spectra were taken with a Lambda 750 UV/Vis/NIR spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer, USA).The specific surface areas of the asprepared samples were measured with a Micromeritics ASAP-2020 instrument and analyzed by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method.Decay curves of the as-prepared samples were obtained on a FLS920 fluorescence lifetime spectrophotometer (Edinburgh Instruments, UK) under the excitation of a hydrogen flash lamp with the wavelength at 325 nm (nF900; Edinburgh Instruments).Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were detected using fluorescence spectrophotometer (F-4600, Hitachi) equipped with a 150 W Xe lamp as the excited light source. 5 mg of the as-synthesized samples, 10 mL triethanolamine (TEOA, 15 vol.), and 10 L chloroplatinic acid (H 2 PtCl 6 , 12 mM) aqueous solution were added in a 35 mL quartz reactor, orderly.Then, the quartz reactor was sealed by a rubber plug, following by ventilation with argon gas for 10 min to drive away the residual air.Subsequently, the reactor was exposed under simulated sunlight (300-W Xe lamp, PLS-SXE300UV coupled with the AM1.5 filter).The gas product composition was periodically analyzed by a gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) (Beifen-Ruili Analytical Instrument, SP-3420A). 10 mg of the Pt-loaded sample was dispersed into 2 mL of deionized water to form a suspension.Then, the above suspension was uniformly dropped onto a 2 cm 2 cm glass substrate.As the water solvent evaporated, the film consisted of the Pt-loaded sample was formed on the glass substrate.Afterwards, the glass with the Pt-loaded sample was put into the 35-mL quartz reactor.Before the irradiation, the reactor was infused with high purity CO 2 for 30 min to degas the residual air.Meanwhile, 0.1 mL of deionized water was injected into the reactor for providing the water vapor.Finally, the reactor loading with the Ptloaded sample was exposed under a 500 W Xe lamp (PLS-SXE300UV).The gas products were periodically analyzed quantitatively by a gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) (Beifen-Ruili Analytical Instrument, SP-3420A). According to the first-principles calculations and analyses, we synthesized the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs through a facile threestep route (Fig. 2A): (i) the synthesis of the g-C 3 N 4 NSs by combining a traditional thermal polymerization method with the followed ultrasonic exfoliation treatment; (ii) the assembly of highly-dispersed HPW clusters onto the surfaces of g-C 3 N 4 NSs based on the electrostatic interaction force between HPW and g-C 3 N 4 ; (iii) the heat treatment of the HPW-adsorbed g-C 3 N 4 NSs to strengthen the chemical bonding at their hetero-interface, and thus obtaining the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs.During the synthesis process, we, at first, adjusted the surface charges of the g-C 3 N 4 NSs into the positive polarity for adsorbing the negatively-charged Keggin units in the aqueous solution.As shown in Fig. S1, the zeta potential of the as-synthesized g-C 3 N 4 NSs depends on pH value of the aqueous solution suspended with g-C 3 N 4 NSs.Particularly, the surface charges of the g-C 3 N 4 NSs could be changed into the positive polarity when the pH value of the suspension solution was adjusted below 4.5.Thus, a homogeneous dissolution of HPW molecules into the above g-C 3 N 4 NSs-suspended solution would induce a self-assembly of highly-dispersed HPW clusters on the surface of the g-C 3 N 4 NSs due to the electrostatic adsorption process between the negatively-charged PW 12 O 40 3-groups of HPW molecules and the positively-charged g-C 3 N 4 NSs.In order to reinforce the hetero-interface quality in the obtained HPW/g-C 3 N 4 composite NSs, the followed heattreatment process was carried out.It could further strengthen the chemical bonding at their hetero-interface, and leading to the formation of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs in the viewpoint of chemical kinetics and solid state physics 23242526. Fig. 2B shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the as-synthesized samples.For the sample of the g-C 3 N 4 NSs, two diffraction peaks appear at 13.1and 27.4, which can be indexed to the (100) and (002) planes of g-C 3 N 4 , respectively 7,8,15,27.For the sample of HPW, the diffraction peaks at 1012, 1622, 2330and 3140a re attributed to the typical HPW with a Keggin structure, which have ever been reported in previous literature 15.However, the characteristic diffraction peaks of HPW could not be observed in the XRD patterns of HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs, even though the mass ratio of HPW to g-C 3 N 4 was increased from 5 wt. to 30 wt..This phenomenon may be attributed to the fact that the ultra-small sized HPW units were highly dispersed on the surface of the g-C 3 N 4 NSs, thereby leading to a poor crystal-diffraction signal beyond the XRD probing limit. In order to ensure the co-existence of HPW and g-C 3 N 4 component in the heterojunction NSs, we investigated the Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of the as-synthesized samples (Fig. 2B,C).For the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs, the peaks located at 3400 cm -1 to 3000 cm -1 are attributed to stretching vibration of -NH 2 and NH amino groups, while several weak peaks ranging from 1700cm -1 to 1120 cm -1 are assigned to the stretching vibration modes of CeN and CN bonds in CN heterocycles.And, the peak at 812 cm -1 is related to the feature vibration mode of s-triazine ring unit 17,28.In the case of HPW, the feature vibration modes of keggin units are located at 1080.1 cm -1 , 981.76 cm -1 , 889.18 cm -1 , and 802.38 cm -1 , which denote the P-O a bonds of the PO 4 tetrahedron, the W O d bonds, and the two W-O b/c -W bonds, respectively 17.After coupling HPW with g-C 3 N 4 , the characteristic vibrational peaks related to both the g-C 3 N 4 NSs and HPW could be found simultaneously on the FT-IR spectrum of the formed HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs.As compared to the pure HPW, the three characteristic peaks related to Keggin units (WO d bonds, and two WeO b/c eW bonds) are shifted to 979.83 cm -1 , 893.04 cm -1 , and 812.03 cm -1 , respectively, on the FT-IR spectrum of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs.This phenomenon suggests the existence of chemical interaction between HPW and g-C 3 N 4 in their heterojunction NSs produced by the static adsorption-deposition method and subsequent vacuum annealing treatment. To determine in-depth the chemical interaction between the HPW and the g-C 3 N 4 components in their heterojunction NSs, the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses of the as-synthesized samples were implemented.As observed in Fig. 3A, three feature peaks, corresponding to sp 2 CeC bonds (284.6 eV), sp 3 -coordinated carbon bonds (285.4 eV), and N-bonded sp 2 C-atom in the s-triazine (NeCN) (287.8 eV) 29,30, can be detected on the C 1s core-level spectrum of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs.However, the feature peaks of the sp 3 -coordinated carbon bonds and the NeCN bonds on the spectrum of the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs shift to the higher binding energy side as compared to the corresponding peaks of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs.In addition, a new peak with the binding energy at around 286.2 eV was observed, which could be ascribed to the formation of CeO bands 31,32.Fig. 3B displays the N 1s core-level spectra of the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs in comparison with the g-C 3 N 4 NSs.It is obvious that the binding energies of the sp 2 -bonded N (CeNC), tertiary nitrogen N-(C) 3 groups, and amino groups (CeNeH) 8,33,34 on the spectrum of the heterojunction NSs are also higher than the corresponding energies on the spectrum of the pure g-C 3 N 4 .The O 1s core-level spectra of the pure HPW and the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs are given in Fig. 3C.The two feature peaks on the spectrum of the pure HPW are originated from to the WeOeW (530.8 eV) and WeOeP/WeOeH bonds (531.9 eV), respectively 17.In the case of 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs, the above two peaks also shift toward the higher binding energy side as compared to the pure HPW.Interestingly, the two new peaks attributed to the CeOeW (532.6 eV) and C(N) 3 -OH (533.7 eV) bonds 17,18,35, can be found on the O 1s core-level spectrum of the heterojunction NSs.The appeared C(N) 3 -OH bonds in the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs could be attributed to the substitution of the amino groups by the hydroxyl groups after the acidizing treatment of g-C 3 N 4 NSs 17,18, thereby leading to the formation of N defects.Meanwhile, the observation of the CeOeW bond is consistent with the DFT calculation results, further confirming that the HPW and g-C 3 N 4 in their heterojunction NSs are linked by the CeOeW bond.Notably, the W 4f 7/2 and W 4f 5/2 peaks of the pure HPW located at 35.8 and 37.9 eV 17,18, respectively, are shifted to the lower binding energy sides after forming the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction (Fig. 3D).According to the previous reports, the binding energy shifts on the XPS spectra of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs can be ascribed to the electron transfer across the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 hetero-interface through the formed CeOeW bond due to the different electron concentration between the two heterocomponents.Additionally, the P 2p core-level signal could be also detected on the XPS spectrum of HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs, as shown in Fig. S3.The binding energy peak centered at 133.8 eV indicates the existence of P 5 in the oxidation state 15,18, which is in agreement with the valence state of P in the HPW.It further demonstrates that the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs were constructed through the self-assembly method based on the static adsorption-deposition process. The aforementioned results confirm the successful synthesis of HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs.To determine the distribution and the size of HPW on the g-C 3 N 4 NSs, the as-synthesized samples were, at first, observed by atomic force microscope (AFM) images (Fig. 4).The g-C 3 N 4 NSs show up the smooth surfaces and layered structure (Fig. 4A).Besides, the thickness is between 3-5 nm (Fig. 4B,C).After combination with HPW, the surfaces of HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs is still flat (Fig. 4D) and the thickness of heterojunction NSs remain between 3-5 nm (Fig. 4E,F), implying the ultra-small size (may be less than 3 nm) and highly-dispersed distribution of the HPW clusters on the surfaces of the g-C 3 N 4 NSs.The morphologies of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs and the single component of g-C 3 N 4 NSs were further observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images.As shown in Fig. 5A, the g-C 3 N 4 exfoliated by the ultrasonic method exhibits a corrugated-sheet structure with smooth surface.After loading HPW clusters onto these exfoliated g-C 3 N 4 NSs through the adsorption-deposition method, the surface of the obtained HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs still remain smooth, as observed by the SEM images in Figs.5B andS2.Surprisingly, no morphology information of HPW clusters was found in both TEM and HRTEM images of HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs (Fig. 5C andD).This may be ascribed to the uniform dispersion of ultra-small sized HPW clusters onto the g-C 3 N 4 NSs.Interestingly, when we employed the HAADF-STEM image to detect the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs in-depth, lots of ultra-small bright dots with a high dispersity could be observed clearly on the surface of the heterojunction NSs (Fig. 5E).These bright dots can be recognized as the heavy element of such W originated from the HPW clusters, because the intensity in the HAADF image depends on the atomic number 36.The above evidence proves that the HPW clusters with sizes less than 2 nm are highly-dispersed on the g-C single hetero-components (Fig. S4).During the TGA testing, the used amounts of the samples are the same.For the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs, the total weight loss between 25 C and 800 C is about 97.2, resulting from the direct thermal decomposition of the g-C 3 N 4 NSs 37.For the pure HPW, there are two steps of mass loss on TGA curve.The first step is a loss of 9.5 between 25 C and 160 C as a result of the weight loss of physical-adsorbed water and crystallization water in HPW.And, the second mass loss of 3.1 between 160 C and 800 C is ascribed to the loss of acidic protons and the decomposition of the Keggin structure 38,39.According to the weight loss of 82.8 in the 20 wt. HPW/ g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs during the heat-treatment, it can be calculated that the actual weight ratio of HPW in the heterojunction NSs is 16.5.Thus, actual mass ratio of HPW to g-C 3 N 4 in the heterojunction NSs is 19.7 wt., which is consistent with the theoretical value (20 wt.) (more calculation details were presented in Supporting information). The light absorption properties of the as-synthesized samples were investigated through UV-vis adsorption spectra, and the corresponding results were shown in Fig. 6 and S5.It can be observed that the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs possess a broad light-absorption range spanning from UV-to visible-light region.However, the pure HPW only displays a UV-light adsorption property.The band gap (E g ) values of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs and HPW were calculated to be 2.75 eV and 3.01 eV, which are consistent with the literatures 12,40.After coupling the g-C 3 N 4 NSs with the HPW clusters, the formed HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs exhibited the blue-shifts of absorption edges as compared to the g-C 3 N 4 NSs.What' more, the blue-shift phenomenon for the absorption edge of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs increased gradually with increasing the HPW content in the NSs (Fig. S5).This result further proves that the ultra-small HPW clusters have been introduced into the g-C 3 N 4 NSs, forming the 2D HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs. Photocatalytic activities of the as-synthesized samples for H 2 generation were evaluated under simulated sunlight irradiation by serving triethanolamine (TEOA) as the sacrificial reagent to slake the photoinduced holes.The H 2 generation rates of the as-synthesized samples are summarized in Fig. 7A.It is showed that the H 2 -generation rate of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs is 6.6 mol h -1 , and the corresponding turnover number (TON) is 110 based on the used amount of Pt co-catalyst (one H 2 molecule per active metal site 41).Meanwhile, the pure HPW is no photoactivity for H 2 generation, which may be attributed to an improper energy-level of its LUMO with respect to that of H reduction potential 12.Notably, the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs show the increased rates of H 2 generation as compared to either the g-C 3 N 4 NSs or HPW hetero-components.It suggests that the static adsorption-deposition of the HPW clusters onto the g-C 3 N 4 NSs can lead to the formation of an effective charge-transfer channel at the intimate interface of the formed HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs, thus hindering the recombination of photoinduced charge-carriers in the g-C 3 N 4 component.Further investigation found that the H 2 generation rate of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs is dominated by the HPW content in the NSs.When the loading amount of HPW was below 20 wt. in the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs, the H 2 -generation rate of the heterojunction NSs increased with increasing the HPW loading.However, a further increase of HPW content (30 wt.) resulted in a decrease of the photocatalytic activity for H 2 generation.This could be ascribed to the fact that the excessive amount of HPW clusters loaded onto the surface of g-C 3 N 4 NSs would shield both the light-absorption and catalytic-active sites nearby the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 hetero-interface regions 28,34,42434445, although a promoted process of charge-transfer may occur in the large-area contact interface between the HPW and g-C 3 N 4 hetero-components.The optimal photocatalytic activity for H 2 generation (14.6 mol h -1 ) was achieved on the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NS (TON 243).Its H 2 -generation rate is 2.2 times higher than that of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs.Please note that only 5 mg of 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs were employed as the photocatalyst for H 2 generation in our work.As shown in Fig. 7B, the H 2 -production yields of all the synthesized g-C 3 N 4 -based samples linearly increase with the irradiation time.After simulated light irradiation for 2 h, the H 2 -generation amount of 20 wt. HPW clusters decorated g-C 3 N 4 NSs could reach 29.2 mol, which is greatly superior to that of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs (12.9 mol).It should be pointed out that after assembling HPW clusters onto the g-C 3 N 4 NSs, the specific-surface-areas of the formed HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs (25.0291 38.5376 m2/g) were similar to that of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs (30.2709 m2/g), as shown in Fig. S6.Thus, we believed that the enhanced photocatalytic activity of HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs for H 2 generation is mainly attributed to the existence of large amounts of uniformly-dispersed and ultra-small sized hetero-interface in the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs.The high-quality hetero-interface of HPW/g-C 3 N 4 with a fascinating molecular-scale structure can not only enhance the interfacial chargetransfer process, but also simultaneously offer abundant light-harvesting and catalytic-active sites at the hetero-interface region, thereby enabling a high-efficient utilization of photoinduced electrons for H 2 generation over the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs. According to the literatures, the energy-band positions of HPW (LUMO and HOMO) and g-C 3 N 4 (VB and CB) are staggered in their heterojunction interface.Thus, there are two possible photoinduced interfacial charge-transfer pathways in the heterojunction NSs (traditional \"type II\" heterojunction or direct Z-scheme mechanism), depending on the Fermi-level positions of the single HPW and g-C 3 N 4 components 464748495051.As shown in Fig. S7, if the Fermi-level of g-C 3 N 4 NSs is higher than that of the HPW, the electrons on the Fermi-level of g-C 3 N 4 NSs will transfer to the Fermi-level of HPW for balancing the Fermi-level of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction system.This electron transfer process creates a built-in electric filed at the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 hetero-interface with the vector direction from the g-C 3 N 4 to HPW sides.In this way, the formed interfacial built-in electric filed would drive \"type II\"-heterojunction charge-transfer process, where the photoinduced electrons transfer from the CB of g-C 3 N 4 to the LUMO of HPW, while the photoinduced holes migrate from the HOMO of HPW to the VB of g-C 3 N 4 .However, the LUMO energy-level of HPW component is below reduction potential of H , leading to photocatalytic inert of HPW for H 2 generation.Thus, the charge transfer process of \"type II\" heterojunction would lead to the decreased photocatalytic performance of HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs.However, this hypothesis is inconsistent with our experimental results.Therefore, we deduce that the contribution of the enhanced photocatalytic activity for HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs comes from the direct Z-scheme mechanism of the To further clarify this issue, we re-tested the photocatalytic activities of the as-synthesized g-C 3 N 4 NSs-based samples for H 2 generation upon visible light irradiation ( 420 nm), because the photon energy at the visible light region could only drive the photoinduced charge-carriers of the g-C 3 N 4 component in the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs.As observed in Fig. 7C, the introduction of photo-inert HPW clusters into g-C 3 N 4 NSs results in the decreased photocatalytic activities of the formed HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs for H 2 generation as compared to the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs.Meanwhile, with increasing the HPW-content from 5 to 30 wt. in the heterojunction NSs, the H 2 generation rate decreased from 3.5 to 2.8 mol h -1 .By combining this observation with the photocatalytic results obtained under simulated light irradiation, we can further confirm the following two aspects: (1) the photoinduced electrons on the LUMO of the HPW clusters are not capable of initiating the proton reduction reaction; (2) the photoinduced electrons on the CB of the g-C 3 N 4 hetero-component are hard to transfer to the HOMO level of the HPW hetero-component, which may be due to the existence of built-in electric-field with the vector direction from the g-C 3 N 4 to the HPW sides at HPW/g-C 3 N 4 hetero-interface for hindering the interfacial electron-transfer process of the \"type II\" heterojunction (Fig. S7).In other word, the built-in electric-field at the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 hetero-interface would drive the photoinduced electron transfer from the LUMO level of HPW heterocomponent to the VB of the g-C 3 N 4 hetero-component, thereby forming the direct Z-scheme mechanism of the photoinduced electron transfer after the excitation of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs. To strengthen the aforementioned conclusion, the spectral dependence of the photocatalytic performance was implemented on the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs along with the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs.As shown in Fig. 7D, upon UV light irradiation (365 and 380 nm), the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs displayed the higher photocatalytic H 2 -generation amount as compared with the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs.However, when the excitation photon energy is lower than the band gap of HPW component, the H 2 -generation amounts over the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs were lower than those of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs.These observations are in accordance with the above analysis results, revealing that the HPW component in the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs can serve as the photo-sensitizer to prolong the lifetimes of the photoinduced electrons on the CB of g-C 3 N 4 component based on the direct Z-scheme process of interfacial electron transfer.Moreover, the wavelength-dependent apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs and the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs can be calculated by the following equation: As shown in Fig. 7E, the curve linked by the AQE values of both the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction and the g-C 3 N 4 NSs are consistent with the results of the their corresponding UV-vis absorption spectra (Fig. 5A), powerfully confirming that the photocatalytic H 2 generation of these NSs are driven by the photoinduced charge-carriers.Notably, the AQE value of the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs (used 5 mg) is estimated as 0.65 under irradiation at 365 nm, which is obviously higher than that of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs.It suggests that although the photocatalytic quantum efficiency of the Z-scheme heterojunction photocatalyst, in theoretical, is only a half of that for the single hetero-components in the photocatalyst, the construction of the Zscheme heterojunction photocatalyst is still an effective strategy to hinder the recombination of photoinduced charge-carriers in the single hetero-components for enhancing photocatalytic solar-to-fuels conversion. Besides, the stability of the optimal as-prepared 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs was investigated through performing a cycling test of simulated sunlight-irradiated catalytic H 2 generation (Fig. S8).After three cycles, the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs maintained 93.1 of its initial photocatalytic activity in the first cycle, indicating a good photocatalytic stability of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs.To further generalize the idea of the enhancement of photoinduced charge-carriers separation from the decorated HPW, we used another photocatalytic reaction, photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with water vapor, as a model system to test the photocatalytic activity of the HPW/ g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs.Control experiments indicated that upon UV-vis light irradiation, there was no CO or CH 4 release in the absence of either CO 2 or the photocatalyst.These results reveal that the gas products were generated from the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction but not from the contaminants.As observed in Fig. 7F and7 G, CO gas is the only product during the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction over the g-C 3 N 4 and HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs photocatalysts.Upon UV-vis light irradiation, the CO-yield rate of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs (3.83 mol g -1 h -1 ) is 6.7 times higher than that of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs (0.56 mol g -1 h -1 ).Furthermore, the CO-yield of assynthesized samples increased with the irradiation time, suggesting the occurrence of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction over the samples.It can be found that the enhancement factor of the photocatalytic activity of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs to the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs in CO 2 reduction (6.7) is much higher than that in the above H 2 generation (2.2).This phenomenon can be explained by the fact that there is only a small proportion of UV light in the simulated sunlight spectrum, thereby leading to a weak excitation behavior of the HPW heterocomponent in the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs during the photocatalytic H 2 generation.When the proportion of UV light was increased in the UV-vis light spectrum (xenon lamp without any filter), the light excitation process of the HPW hetero-component in the heterojunction NSs could be enhanced.Thus, the interfacial charge transfer process in the Z-scheme HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs was further improved to cause the larger enhancement factor of the photocatalytic activity in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction. To further illuminate the Z-scheme mechanism in the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs, the steady-state and transient photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy of the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs were studied in comparison with that of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs.In Fig. 8A, by selecting the excitation wavelength at 325 nm, a strong emission peak at 446 nm is observed on the steady-state PL curve of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs.When these g-C 3 N 4 NSs were combined with the HPW clusters to form the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs, the intensity of emission peak at 446 nm was decreased.The decreased intensity of emission peak could be attributed to the possible existence of two kinds of charge-carrier dynamics processes in the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs: one is the transfer process of the photoinduced electrons from the LUMO of HPW component to the VB of g-C 3 N 4 component to quench the photoinduced holes on the VB of g-C 3 N 4 component; the other is the transfer process of photoinduced electrons from the CB of g-C 3 N 4 component to the LUMO of HPW component.To obtain a better understanding on the transfer process of photoinduced electrons between the g-C 3 N 4 and HPW components in their heterojunction NSs, a multiexponential decay function is used to fit the corresponding time-resolved transient PL spectroscopy.The function could be expressed as following 52: where 1 and 2 are the fluorescent lifetime, and A 1 , and A 2 are the corresponding amplitudes.This result suggests the existence of two different decay channels in the g-C 3 N 4 NSs after 325 nm excitation.As observed in the insets of Fig. 8B andC, the time constant ( 1 ) of the fast decay process is 2.19 ns for the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs, which is shorter than that of the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs (3.06 ns).This fast decay process is caused by the non-radiative recombination of photoinduced charge-carriers in the defect states of g-C 3 N 4 42,53,54. What's more, the time constant ( 2 ) of the slow decay process is originated from the radiative recombination of the free excitations in g-C 3 N 4 42,53,54.It can be found that the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs still possesses a longer lifetime (16.72 ns) than that of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs (10.48 ns).The average emission lifetimes of the above two samples can be calculated via the following equation 55: The results indicate that the average lifetime of g-C 3 N 4 NSs is extended from 6.78 ns to 8.94 ns after loading with the HPW clusters.This result provides a solid evidence to prove the fact that the dynamics process of the photoinduced charge-transfer across the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 hetero-interface followed the Z-scheme mechanism rather than the traditional \"type II\" heterojunction mechanism.According to the energy band structures of HPW and g-C 3 N 4 12, it could be deduced that in the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs, the photoinduced electrons on the LUMO of HPW transfer to the VB of g-C 3 N 4 to combine with the photoinduced holes on the g-C 3 N 4 side. To further elucidate the Z-scheme enhanced of photocatalytic activity of HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs for the solar-to-fuels conversion, the photoinduced charge-carriers transfer process in these heterojunction NSs is illustrated in Fig. 8D.Upon UV-vis light irradiation, the HPW clusters and the g-C 3 N 4 NSs in their heterojunction NSs are excited simultaneously.Then, the photoinduced electrons on the LUMO of the HPW component can transfer to VB of the g-C 3 N 4 component to quench its photoinduced holes, thereby greatly extending the lifetime of the photoinduced electrons on the CB of g-C 3 N 4 .Afterwards, these photoinduced electrons are further trapped by the co-catalysts of Pt nanoparticles to lower down their over-potentials for reducing the protons into H 2 and reducing CO 2 into CO, respectively 16,56.Meanwhile, the photoinduced holes remained at the HOMO of HPW component are capable of implementing some oxidation reaction in the presence of appropriate electron donors, for instance, TEOA for the H 2 generation and water for the CO 2 reduction in the our current study.According to the literatures 57,58, the possible pathway for CO 2 reduction on the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs may go through as follows: CO 2 (g) CO 2 (1) CO 2 e - H COOH COOH e - H CO H 2 O (4) CO CO (5) where \"\" represents the corresponding adsorption state on the catalyst surface.During the process of CO 2 reduction, the Z-scheme transfer mechanism of photoinduced charge-carriers could result in the enhanced separation of photoinduced charge-carriers in the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs to promote the photocatalytic activity of CO 2 reduction.However, when the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs were under visible irradiation, the interband transition of HPW is forbidden.This leads to no available photo-induced electrons on the LUMO of HPW for quenching the photoinduced holes of the g-C 3 N 4 NSs.Meanwhile, the built-in electric field at the interface HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction also hinders the transfer process of the photoinduced electron from the CB of the g-C 3 N 4 component to the LUMO of the HPW component, as illustrated in Fig. S7.In this way, the photocatalytic inert component of such HPW (for H 2 generation and CO 2 reduction) would shield the photocatalytic reaction sites of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs.Thus, the visible-light photocatalytic performance of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs decreases as the increase of loading amount of the HPW clusters on the g-C 3 N 4 NSs. In summary, we have successfully synthesized a Z-scheme photocatalyst with the molecular-scale hetero-interface through self-assembly of ultra-small HPW clusters onto g-C 3 N 4 NSs via a facile static adsorption-deposition method.The HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs possesses significant enhancements for both photocatalytic H 2 generation and CO 2 reduction based on the unique synergistic photocatalysis effect between the abundant surface active-sites, the high hetero-interface quality, as well as the Z-scheme-improved charge-carriers separation process.The as-synthesized 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heteojunction NSs exhibited 2.2 and 6.7 folds on photocatalytic H 2 generation and CO 2 reduction, respectively, as compared to the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs, even though the pure HPW component was photocatalytic-inert for either H 2 generation or CO 2 reduction upon UV-vis light irradiation.It is anticipated that the designed HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs may provide new insights for exploring molecular-scale heteropolyacid-decorated 2D layered Z-scheme photocatalysts with high hetero-interface quality and abundant active-sites for photocatalytic solar-to-fuels conversion.

The g-C 3 N 4 was prepared by a traditional thermal polymerization method.Typically, 10 g of carbamide powder was lapped for 60 min in a mortar and then transferred to a 50 mL alumina crucible with a cover.Subsequently, the crucible was heated to 550 C with a rising rate of 18 C/min and kept for 2 h at 550 C, thereby obtaining the g-C 3 N 4 bulk with faint-yellow color. Typically, 100 mg g-C 3 N 4 bulk was ultrasonically dispersed into the deionized water to form the suspension solution of g-C 3 N 4 NSs.Then, the pH value of g-C 3 N 4 suspension solution was adjusted to 3.1 by dropwise adding 1.2 M of HCl solution.Afterward, 5, 10, 20, 30 mg of HPW were dissolved in deionized water and then added the obtained HPW solution to the g-C 3 N 4 suspension solution with vigorous stirring for 2 h.The weight ratio of HPW to g-C 3 N 4 was determined to be 5, 10, 20, and 30 wt., respectively.Subsequently, the mixture was separated by the centrifugal treatment, and dried at 70 C for 12 h to obtain the g-C 3 N 4 NSs loaded with different amount of HPW.Finally, the HPWloaded g-C 3 N 4 NSs were annealed at 300 C for 2 h under the vacuum condition, thereby synthesizing the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs. The laser particle size and zeta potential analyzer (Zetasizer SZ-100Z, Horiba) was used to measure the surface charge polarity of the samples.The crystallization and the phase transition were studied by X ray diffractometer (XRD; XRD-6000, Shimadzu) with a Cu K line of 0.1541 nm and the radiation is from 10to 80, at a scanning rate at 2/ min.Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were recorded on a Magna 560 FT-IR spectrometer with a resolution of 1 cm -1 .X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on a VG-ESCALAB LKII instrument with a Mg K ADES (h 1253.6eV) source at a residual gas pressure below 10 -8 Pa.The surface topography and sample thickness of as-prepared samples were studied by atomic force microscope (AFM; Bruker Dimension IconTM).The morphology and structure of the as-prepared samples were observed by scanning electron microscope (SEM; S-4800, Hitachi), transmission electron microscopy (TEM; JEM-2100, JEOL).Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out on a NETZSCH STA 449C thermo-analyzer in air.UV-vis absorption spectra were taken with a Lambda 750 UV/Vis/NIR spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer, USA).The specific surface areas of the asprepared samples were measured with a Micromeritics ASAP-2020 instrument and analyzed by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method.Decay curves of the as-prepared samples were obtained on a FLS920 fluorescence lifetime spectrophotometer (Edinburgh Instruments, UK) under the excitation of a hydrogen flash lamp with the wavelength at 325 nm (nF900; Edinburgh Instruments).Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were detected using fluorescence spectrophotometer (F-4600, Hitachi) equipped with a 150 W Xe lamp as the excited light source. 5 mg of the as-synthesized samples, 10 mL triethanolamine (TEOA, 15 vol.), and 10 L chloroplatinic acid (H 2 PtCl 6 , 12 mM) aqueous solution were added in a 35 mL quartz reactor, orderly.Then, the quartz reactor was sealed by a rubber plug, following by ventilation with argon gas for 10 min to drive away the residual air.Subsequently, the reactor was exposed under simulated sunlight (300-W Xe lamp, PLS-SXE300UV coupled with the AM1.5 filter).The gas product composition was periodically analyzed by a gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) (Beifen-Ruili Analytical Instrument, SP-3420A). 10 mg of the Pt-loaded sample was dispersed into 2 mL of deionized water to form a suspension.Then, the above suspension was uniformly dropped onto a 2 cm 2 cm glass substrate.As the water solvent evaporated, the film consisted of the Pt-loaded sample was formed on the glass substrate.Afterwards, the glass with the Pt-loaded sample was put into the 35-mL quartz reactor.Before the irradiation, the reactor was infused with high purity CO 2 for 30 min to degas the residual air.Meanwhile, 0.1 mL of deionized water was injected into the reactor for providing the water vapor.Finally, the reactor loading with the Ptloaded sample was exposed under a 500 W Xe lamp (PLS-SXE300UV).The gas products were periodically analyzed quantitatively by a gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) (Beifen-Ruili Analytical Instrument, SP-3420A). According to the first-principles calculations and analyses, we synthesized the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs through a facile threestep route (Fig. 2A): (i) the synthesis of the g-C 3 N 4 NSs by combining a traditional thermal polymerization method with the followed ultrasonic exfoliation treatment; (ii) the assembly of highly-dispersed HPW clusters onto the surfaces of g-C 3 N 4 NSs based on the electrostatic interaction force between HPW and g-C 3 N 4 ; (iii) the heat treatment of the HPW-adsorbed g-C 3 N 4 NSs to strengthen the chemical bonding at their hetero-interface, and thus obtaining the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs.During the synthesis process, we, at first, adjusted the surface charges of the g-C 3 N 4 NSs into the positive polarity for adsorbing the negatively-charged Keggin units in the aqueous solution.As shown in Fig. S1, the zeta potential of the as-synthesized g-C 3 N 4 NSs depends on pH value of the aqueous solution suspended with g-C 3 N 4 NSs.Particularly, the surface charges of the g-C 3 N 4 NSs could be changed into the positive polarity when the pH value of the suspension solution was adjusted below 4.5.Thus, a homogeneous dissolution of HPW molecules into the above g-C 3 N 4 NSs-suspended solution would induce a self-assembly of highly-dispersed HPW clusters on the surface of the g-C 3 N 4 NSs due to the electrostatic adsorption process between the negatively-charged PW 12 O 40 3-groups of HPW molecules and the positively-charged g-C 3 N 4 NSs.In order to reinforce the hetero-interface quality in the obtained HPW/g-C 3 N 4 composite NSs, the followed heattreatment process was carried out.It could further strengthen the chemical bonding at their hetero-interface, and leading to the formation of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs in the viewpoint of chemical kinetics and solid state physics 23242526. Fig. 2B shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the as-synthesized samples.For the sample of the g-C 3 N 4 NSs, two diffraction peaks appear at 13.1and 27.4, which can be indexed to the (100) and (002) planes of g-C 3 N 4 , respectively 7,8,15,27.For the sample of HPW, the diffraction peaks at 1012, 1622, 2330and 3140a re attributed to the typical HPW with a Keggin structure, which have ever been reported in previous literature 15.However, the characteristic diffraction peaks of HPW could not be observed in the XRD patterns of HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs, even though the mass ratio of HPW to g-C 3 N 4 was increased from 5 wt. to 30 wt..This phenomenon may be attributed to the fact that the ultra-small sized HPW units were highly dispersed on the surface of the g-C 3 N 4 NSs, thereby leading to a poor crystal-diffraction signal beyond the XRD probing limit. In order to ensure the co-existence of HPW and g-C 3 N 4 component in the heterojunction NSs, we investigated the Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of the as-synthesized samples (Fig. 2B,C).For the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs, the peaks located at 3400 cm -1 to 3000 cm -1 are attributed to stretching vibration of -NH 2 and NH amino groups, while several weak peaks ranging from 1700cm -1 to 1120 cm -1 are assigned to the stretching vibration modes of CeN and CN bonds in CN heterocycles.And, the peak at 812 cm -1 is related to the feature vibration mode of s-triazine ring unit 17,28.In the case of HPW, the feature vibration modes of keggin units are located at 1080.1 cm -1 , 981.76 cm -1 , 889.18 cm -1 , and 802.38 cm -1 , which denote the P-O a bonds of the PO 4 tetrahedron, the W O d bonds, and the two W-O b/c -W bonds, respectively 17.After coupling HPW with g-C 3 N 4 , the characteristic vibrational peaks related to both the g-C 3 N 4 NSs and HPW could be found simultaneously on the FT-IR spectrum of the formed HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs.As compared to the pure HPW, the three characteristic peaks related to Keggin units (WO d bonds, and two WeO b/c eW bonds) are shifted to 979.83 cm -1 , 893.04 cm -1 , and 812.03 cm -1 , respectively, on the FT-IR spectrum of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs.This phenomenon suggests the existence of chemical interaction between HPW and g-C 3 N 4 in their heterojunction NSs produced by the static adsorption-deposition method and subsequent vacuum annealing treatment. To determine in-depth the chemical interaction between the HPW and the g-C 3 N 4 components in their heterojunction NSs, the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses of the as-synthesized samples were implemented.As observed in Fig. 3A, three feature peaks, corresponding to sp 2 CeC bonds (284.6 eV), sp 3 -coordinated carbon bonds (285.4 eV), and N-bonded sp 2 C-atom in the s-triazine (NeCN) (287.8 eV) 29,30, can be detected on the C 1s core-level spectrum of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs.However, the feature peaks of the sp 3 -coordinated carbon bonds and the NeCN bonds on the spectrum of the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs shift to the higher binding energy side as compared to the corresponding peaks of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs.In addition, a new peak with the binding energy at around 286.2 eV was observed, which could be ascribed to the formation of CeO bands 31,32.Fig. 3B displays the N 1s core-level spectra of the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs in comparison with the g-C 3 N 4 NSs.It is obvious that the binding energies of the sp 2 -bonded N (CeNC), tertiary nitrogen N-(C) 3 groups, and amino groups (CeNeH) 8,33,34 on the spectrum of the heterojunction NSs are also higher than the corresponding energies on the spectrum of the pure g-C 3 N 4 .The O 1s core-level spectra of the pure HPW and the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs are given in Fig. 3C.The two feature peaks on the spectrum of the pure HPW are originated from to the WeOeW (530.8 eV) and WeOeP/WeOeH bonds (531.9 eV), respectively 17.In the case of 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs, the above two peaks also shift toward the higher binding energy side as compared to the pure HPW.Interestingly, the two new peaks attributed to the CeOeW (532.6 eV) and C(N) 3 -OH (533.7 eV) bonds 17,18,35, can be found on the O 1s core-level spectrum of the heterojunction NSs.The appeared C(N) 3 -OH bonds in the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs could be attributed to the substitution of the amino groups by the hydroxyl groups after the acidizing treatment of g-C 3 N 4 NSs 17,18, thereby leading to the formation of N defects.Meanwhile, the observation of the CeOeW bond is consistent with the DFT calculation results, further confirming that the HPW and g-C 3 N 4 in their heterojunction NSs are linked by the CeOeW bond.Notably, the W 4f 7/2 and W 4f 5/2 peaks of the pure HPW located at 35.8 and 37.9 eV 17,18, respectively, are shifted to the lower binding energy sides after forming the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction (Fig. 3D).According to the previous reports, the binding energy shifts on the XPS spectra of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs can be ascribed to the electron transfer across the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 hetero-interface through the formed CeOeW bond due to the different electron concentration between the two heterocomponents.Additionally, the P 2p core-level signal could be also detected on the XPS spectrum of HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs, as shown in Fig. S3.The binding energy peak centered at 133.8 eV indicates the existence of P 5 in the oxidation state 15,18, which is in agreement with the valence state of P in the HPW.It further demonstrates that the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs were constructed through the self-assembly method based on the static adsorption-deposition process. The aforementioned results confirm the successful synthesis of HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs.To determine the distribution and the size of HPW on the g-C 3 N 4 NSs, the as-synthesized samples were, at first, observed by atomic force microscope (AFM) images (Fig. 4).The g-C 3 N 4 NSs show up the smooth surfaces and layered structure (Fig. 4A).Besides, the thickness is between 3-5 nm (Fig. 4B,C).After combination with HPW, the surfaces of HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs is still flat (Fig. 4D) and the thickness of heterojunction NSs remain between 3-5 nm (Fig. 4E,F), implying the ultra-small size (may be less than 3 nm) and highly-dispersed distribution of the HPW clusters on the surfaces of the g-C 3 N 4 NSs.The morphologies of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs and the single component of g-C 3 N 4 NSs were further observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images.As shown in Fig. 5A, the g-C 3 N 4 exfoliated by the ultrasonic method exhibits a corrugated-sheet structure with smooth surface.After loading HPW clusters onto these exfoliated g-C 3 N 4 NSs through the adsorption-deposition method, the surface of the obtained HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs still remain smooth, as observed by the SEM images in Figs.5B andS2.Surprisingly, no morphology information of HPW clusters was found in both TEM and HRTEM images of HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs (Fig. 5C andD).This may be ascribed to the uniform dispersion of ultra-small sized HPW clusters onto the g-C 3 N 4 NSs.Interestingly, when we employed the HAADF-STEM image to detect the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs in-depth, lots of ultra-small bright dots with a high dispersity could be observed clearly on the surface of the heterojunction NSs (Fig. 5E).These bright dots can be recognized as the heavy element of such W originated from the HPW clusters, because the intensity in the HAADF image depends on the atomic number 36.The above evidence proves that the HPW clusters with sizes less than 2 nm are highly-dispersed on the g-C single hetero-components (Fig. S4).During the TGA testing, the used amounts of the samples are the same.For the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs, the total weight loss between 25 C and 800 C is about 97.2, resulting from the direct thermal decomposition of the g-C 3 N 4 NSs 37.For the pure HPW, there are two steps of mass loss on TGA curve.The first step is a loss of 9.5 between 25 C and 160 C as a result of the weight loss of physical-adsorbed water and crystallization water in HPW.And, the second mass loss of 3.1 between 160 C and 800 C is ascribed to the loss of acidic protons and the decomposition of the Keggin structure 38,39.According to the weight loss of 82.8 in the 20 wt. HPW/ g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs during the heat-treatment, it can be calculated that the actual weight ratio of HPW in the heterojunction NSs is 16.5.Thus, actual mass ratio of HPW to g-C 3 N 4 in the heterojunction NSs is 19.7 wt., which is consistent with the theoretical value (20 wt.) (more calculation details were presented in Supporting information). The light absorption properties of the as-synthesized samples were investigated through UV-vis adsorption spectra, and the corresponding results were shown in Fig. 6 and S5.It can be observed that the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs possess a broad light-absorption range spanning from UV-to visible-light region.However, the pure HPW only displays a UV-light adsorption property.The band gap (E g ) values of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs and HPW were calculated to be 2.75 eV and 3.01 eV, which are consistent with the literatures 12,40.After coupling the g-C 3 N 4 NSs with the HPW clusters, the formed HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs exhibited the blue-shifts of absorption edges as compared to the g-C 3 N 4 NSs.What' more, the blue-shift phenomenon for the absorption edge of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs increased gradually with increasing the HPW content in the NSs (Fig. S5).This result further proves that the ultra-small HPW clusters have been introduced into the g-C 3 N 4 NSs, forming the 2D HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs. Photocatalytic activities of the as-synthesized samples for H 2 generation were evaluated under simulated sunlight irradiation by serving triethanolamine (TEOA) as the sacrificial reagent to slake the photoinduced holes.The H 2 generation rates of the as-synthesized samples are summarized in Fig. 7A.It is showed that the H 2 -generation rate of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs is 6.6 mol h -1 , and the corresponding turnover number (TON) is 110 based on the used amount of Pt co-catalyst (one H 2 molecule per active metal site 41).Meanwhile, the pure HPW is no photoactivity for H 2 generation, which may be attributed to an improper energy-level of its LUMO with respect to that of H reduction potential 12.Notably, the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs show the increased rates of H 2 generation as compared to either the g-C 3 N 4 NSs or HPW hetero-components.It suggests that the static adsorption-deposition of the HPW clusters onto the g-C 3 N 4 NSs can lead to the formation of an effective charge-transfer channel at the intimate interface of the formed HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs, thus hindering the recombination of photoinduced charge-carriers in the g-C 3 N 4 component.Further investigation found that the H 2 generation rate of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs is dominated by the HPW content in the NSs.When the loading amount of HPW was below 20 wt. in the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs, the H 2 -generation rate of the heterojunction NSs increased with increasing the HPW loading.However, a further increase of HPW content (30 wt.) resulted in a decrease of the photocatalytic activity for H 2 generation.This could be ascribed to the fact that the excessive amount of HPW clusters loaded onto the surface of g-C 3 N 4 NSs would shield both the light-absorption and catalytic-active sites nearby the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 hetero-interface regions 28,34,42434445, although a promoted process of charge-transfer may occur in the large-area contact interface between the HPW and g-C 3 N 4 hetero-components.The optimal photocatalytic activity for H 2 generation (14.6 mol h -1 ) was achieved on the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NS (TON 243).Its H 2 -generation rate is 2.2 times higher than that of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs.Please note that only 5 mg of 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs were employed as the photocatalyst for H 2 generation in our work.As shown in Fig. 7B, the H 2 -production yields of all the synthesized g-C 3 N 4 -based samples linearly increase with the irradiation time.After simulated light irradiation for 2 h, the H 2 -generation amount of 20 wt. HPW clusters decorated g-C 3 N 4 NSs could reach 29.2 mol, which is greatly superior to that of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs (12.9 mol).It should be pointed out that after assembling HPW clusters onto the g-C 3 N 4 NSs, the specific-surface-areas of the formed HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs (25.0291 38.5376 m2/g) were similar to that of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs (30.2709 m2/g), as shown in Fig. S6.Thus, we believed that the enhanced photocatalytic activity of HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs for H 2 generation is mainly attributed to the existence of large amounts of uniformly-dispersed and ultra-small sized hetero-interface in the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs.The high-quality hetero-interface of HPW/g-C 3 N 4 with a fascinating molecular-scale structure can not only enhance the interfacial chargetransfer process, but also simultaneously offer abundant light-harvesting and catalytic-active sites at the hetero-interface region, thereby enabling a high-efficient utilization of photoinduced electrons for H 2 generation over the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs. According to the literatures, the energy-band positions of HPW (LUMO and HOMO) and g-C 3 N 4 (VB and CB) are staggered in their heterojunction interface.Thus, there are two possible photoinduced interfacial charge-transfer pathways in the heterojunction NSs (traditional \"type II\" heterojunction or direct Z-scheme mechanism), depending on the Fermi-level positions of the single HPW and g-C 3 N 4 components 464748495051.As shown in Fig. S7, if the Fermi-level of g-C 3 N 4 NSs is higher than that of the HPW, the electrons on the Fermi-level of g-C 3 N 4 NSs will transfer to the Fermi-level of HPW for balancing the Fermi-level of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction system.This electron transfer process creates a built-in electric filed at the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 hetero-interface with the vector direction from the g-C 3 N 4 to HPW sides.In this way, the formed interfacial built-in electric filed would drive \"type II\"-heterojunction charge-transfer process, where the photoinduced electrons transfer from the CB of g-C 3 N 4 to the LUMO of HPW, while the photoinduced holes migrate from the HOMO of HPW to the VB of g-C 3 N 4 .However, the LUMO energy-level of HPW component is below reduction potential of H , leading to photocatalytic inert of HPW for H 2 generation.Thus, the charge transfer process of \"type II\" heterojunction would lead to the decreased photocatalytic performance of HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs.However, this hypothesis is inconsistent with our experimental results.Therefore, we deduce that the contribution of the enhanced photocatalytic activity for HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs comes from the direct Z-scheme mechanism of the To further clarify this issue, we re-tested the photocatalytic activities of the as-synthesized g-C 3 N 4 NSs-based samples for H 2 generation upon visible light irradiation ( 420 nm), because the photon energy at the visible light region could only drive the photoinduced charge-carriers of the g-C 3 N 4 component in the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs.As observed in Fig. 7C, the introduction of photo-inert HPW clusters into g-C 3 N 4 NSs results in the decreased photocatalytic activities of the formed HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs for H 2 generation as compared to the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs.Meanwhile, with increasing the HPW-content from 5 to 30 wt. in the heterojunction NSs, the H 2 generation rate decreased from 3.5 to 2.8 mol h -1 .By combining this observation with the photocatalytic results obtained under simulated light irradiation, we can further confirm the following two aspects: (1) the photoinduced electrons on the LUMO of the HPW clusters are not capable of initiating the proton reduction reaction; (2) the photoinduced electrons on the CB of the g-C 3 N 4 hetero-component are hard to transfer to the HOMO level of the HPW hetero-component, which may be due to the existence of built-in electric-field with the vector direction from the g-C 3 N 4 to the HPW sides at HPW/g-C 3 N 4 hetero-interface for hindering the interfacial electron-transfer process of the \"type II\" heterojunction (Fig. S7).In other word, the built-in electric-field at the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 hetero-interface would drive the photoinduced electron transfer from the LUMO level of HPW heterocomponent to the VB of the g-C 3 N 4 hetero-component, thereby forming the direct Z-scheme mechanism of the photoinduced electron transfer after the excitation of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs. To strengthen the aforementioned conclusion, the spectral dependence of the photocatalytic performance was implemented on the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs along with the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs.As shown in Fig. 7D, upon UV light irradiation (365 and 380 nm), the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs displayed the higher photocatalytic H 2 -generation amount as compared with the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs.However, when the excitation photon energy is lower than the band gap of HPW component, the H 2 -generation amounts over the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs were lower than those of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs.These observations are in accordance with the above analysis results, revealing that the HPW component in the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs can serve as the photo-sensitizer to prolong the lifetimes of the photoinduced electrons on the CB of g-C 3 N 4 component based on the direct Z-scheme process of interfacial electron transfer.Moreover, the wavelength-dependent apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs and the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs can be calculated by the following equation: As shown in Fig. 7E, the curve linked by the AQE values of both the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction and the g-C 3 N 4 NSs are consistent with the results of the their corresponding UV-vis absorption spectra (Fig. 5A), powerfully confirming that the photocatalytic H 2 generation of these NSs are driven by the photoinduced charge-carriers.Notably, the AQE value of the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs (used 5 mg) is estimated as 0.65 under irradiation at 365 nm, which is obviously higher than that of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs.It suggests that although the photocatalytic quantum efficiency of the Z-scheme heterojunction photocatalyst, in theoretical, is only a half of that for the single hetero-components in the photocatalyst, the construction of the Zscheme heterojunction photocatalyst is still an effective strategy to hinder the recombination of photoinduced charge-carriers in the single hetero-components for enhancing photocatalytic solar-to-fuels conversion. Besides, the stability of the optimal as-prepared 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs was investigated through performing a cycling test of simulated sunlight-irradiated catalytic H 2 generation (Fig. S8).After three cycles, the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs maintained 93.1 of its initial photocatalytic activity in the first cycle, indicating a good photocatalytic stability of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs.To further generalize the idea of the enhancement of photoinduced charge-carriers separation from the decorated HPW, we used another photocatalytic reaction, photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with water vapor, as a model system to test the photocatalytic activity of the HPW/ g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs.Control experiments indicated that upon UV-vis light irradiation, there was no CO or CH 4 release in the absence of either CO 2 or the photocatalyst.These results reveal that the gas products were generated from the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction but not from the contaminants.As observed in Fig. 7F and7 G, CO gas is the only product during the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction over the g-C 3 N 4 and HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs photocatalysts.Upon UV-vis light irradiation, the CO-yield rate of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs (3.83 mol g -1 h -1 ) is 6.7 times higher than that of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs (0.56 mol g -1 h -1 ).Furthermore, the CO-yield of assynthesized samples increased with the irradiation time, suggesting the occurrence of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction over the samples.It can be found that the enhancement factor of the photocatalytic activity of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs to the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs in CO 2 reduction (6.7) is much higher than that in the above H 2 generation (2.2).This phenomenon can be explained by the fact that there is only a small proportion of UV light in the simulated sunlight spectrum, thereby leading to a weak excitation behavior of the HPW heterocomponent in the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs during the photocatalytic H 2 generation.When the proportion of UV light was increased in the UV-vis light spectrum (xenon lamp without any filter), the light excitation process of the HPW hetero-component in the heterojunction NSs could be enhanced.Thus, the interfacial charge transfer process in the Z-scheme HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs was further improved to cause the larger enhancement factor of the photocatalytic activity in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction. To further illuminate the Z-scheme mechanism in the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs, the steady-state and transient photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy of the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs were studied in comparison with that of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs.In Fig. 8A, by selecting the excitation wavelength at 325 nm, a strong emission peak at 446 nm is observed on the steady-state PL curve of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs.When these g-C 3 N 4 NSs were combined with the HPW clusters to form the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs, the intensity of emission peak at 446 nm was decreased.The decreased intensity of emission peak could be attributed to the possible existence of two kinds of charge-carrier dynamics processes in the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs: one is the transfer process of the photoinduced electrons from the LUMO of HPW component to the VB of g-C 3 N 4 component to quench the photoinduced holes on the VB of g-C 3 N 4 component; the other is the transfer process of photoinduced electrons from the CB of g-C 3 N 4 component to the LUMO of HPW component.To obtain a better understanding on the transfer process of photoinduced electrons between the g-C 3 N 4 and HPW components in their heterojunction NSs, a multiexponential decay function is used to fit the corresponding time-resolved transient PL spectroscopy.The function could be expressed as following 52: where 1 and 2 are the fluorescent lifetime, and A 1 , and A 2 are the corresponding amplitudes.This result suggests the existence of two different decay channels in the g-C 3 N 4 NSs after 325 nm excitation.As observed in the insets of Fig. 8B andC, the time constant ( 1 ) of the fast decay process is 2.19 ns for the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs, which is shorter than that of the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs (3.06 ns).This fast decay process is caused by the non-radiative recombination of photoinduced charge-carriers in the defect states of g-C 3 N 4 42,53,54. What's more, the time constant ( 2 ) of the slow decay process is originated from the radiative recombination of the free excitations in g-C 3 N 4 42,53,54.It can be found that the 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs still possesses a longer lifetime (16.72 ns) than that of the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs (10.48 ns).The average emission lifetimes of the above two samples can be calculated via the following equation 55: The results indicate that the average lifetime of g-C 3 N 4 NSs is extended from 6.78 ns to 8.94 ns after loading with the HPW clusters.This result provides a solid evidence to prove the fact that the dynamics process of the photoinduced charge-transfer across the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 hetero-interface followed the Z-scheme mechanism rather than the traditional \"type II\" heterojunction mechanism.According to the energy band structures of HPW and g-C 3 N 4 12, it could be deduced that in the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs, the photoinduced electrons on the LUMO of HPW transfer to the VB of g-C 3 N 4 to combine with the photoinduced holes on the g-C 3 N 4 side. To further elucidate the Z-scheme enhanced of photocatalytic activity of HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs for the solar-to-fuels conversion, the photoinduced charge-carriers transfer process in these heterojunction NSs is illustrated in Fig. 8D.Upon UV-vis light irradiation, the HPW clusters and the g-C 3 N 4 NSs in their heterojunction NSs are excited simultaneously.Then, the photoinduced electrons on the LUMO of the HPW component can transfer to VB of the g-C 3 N 4 component to quench its photoinduced holes, thereby greatly extending the lifetime of the photoinduced electrons on the CB of g-C 3 N 4 .Afterwards, these photoinduced electrons are further trapped by the co-catalysts of Pt nanoparticles to lower down their over-potentials for reducing the protons into H 2 and reducing CO 2 into CO, respectively 16,56.Meanwhile, the photoinduced holes remained at the HOMO of HPW component are capable of implementing some oxidation reaction in the presence of appropriate electron donors, for instance, TEOA for the H 2 generation and water for the CO 2 reduction in the our current study.According to the literatures 57,58, the possible pathway for CO 2 reduction on the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs may go through as follows: CO 2 (g) CO 2 (1) CO 2 e - H COOH COOH e - H CO H 2 O (4) CO CO (5) where \"\" represents the corresponding adsorption state on the catalyst surface.During the process of CO 2 reduction, the Z-scheme transfer mechanism of photoinduced charge-carriers could result in the enhanced separation of photoinduced charge-carriers in the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs to promote the photocatalytic activity of CO 2 reduction.However, when the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs were under visible irradiation, the interband transition of HPW is forbidden.This leads to no available photo-induced electrons on the LUMO of HPW for quenching the photoinduced holes of the g-C 3 N 4 NSs.Meanwhile, the built-in electric field at the interface HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction also hinders the transfer process of the photoinduced electron from the CB of the g-C 3 N 4 component to the LUMO of the HPW component, as illustrated in Fig. S7.In this way, the photocatalytic inert component of such HPW (for H 2 generation and CO 2 reduction) would shield the photocatalytic reaction sites of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs.Thus, the visible-light photocatalytic performance of the HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs decreases as the increase of loading amount of the HPW clusters on the g-C 3 N 4 NSs. In summary, we have successfully synthesized a Z-scheme photocatalyst with the molecular-scale hetero-interface through self-assembly of ultra-small HPW clusters onto g-C 3 N 4 NSs via a facile static adsorption-deposition method.The HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs possesses significant enhancements for both photocatalytic H 2 generation and CO 2 reduction based on the unique synergistic photocatalysis effect between the abundant surface active-sites, the high hetero-interface quality, as well as the Z-scheme-improved charge-carriers separation process.The as-synthesized 20 wt. HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heteojunction NSs exhibited 2.2 and 6.7 folds on photocatalytic H 2 generation and CO 2 reduction, respectively, as compared to the pure g-C 3 N 4 NSs, even though the pure HPW component was photocatalytic-inert for either H 2 generation or CO 2 reduction upon UV-vis light irradiation.It is anticipated that the designed HPW/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction NSs may provide new insights for exploring molecular-scale heteropolyacid-decorated 2D layered Z-scheme photocatalysts with high hetero-interface quality and abundant active-sites for photocatalytic solar-to-fuels conversion.
