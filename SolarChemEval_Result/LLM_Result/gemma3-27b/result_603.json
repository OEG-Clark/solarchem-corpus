{"catalyst": "Porous-TiO2 is used as the catalyst in the experiment. Additionally, ALD is used to coat layers of Al2O3 or MgO on the porous-TiO2 to modify its catalytic activity.", "co_catalyst": "The text does not mention a co-catalyst. It details experiments using TiO2 photocatalysts modified with MgO and Al2O3 coatings.", "light source": "450 W Xe lamp (Newport, Inc.)", "lamp": "Xe lamp", "reaction medium": "The reaction medium used in the experiment is a mixture of water and CO2 gas. Specifically, a CO2/H2O gas mixture with a water vapor concentration of 2.3% by volume was used.", "reactor type": "Tubular quartz reactor", "operation mode": "Continuous"}
