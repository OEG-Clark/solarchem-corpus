{"catalyst": "The catalyst used in the experiment is titanium dioxide (TiO2) with different dopants, including Fe-doped, N-doped, and co-doped Fe-N-TiO2 nanoparticles. Commercial TiO2-P25 (Degussa, Evonik) was also used as a benchmark catalyst.", "co_catalyst": "None", "light source": "UV-Vis", "lamp": "The lamp used in the experiment is a 70 W mercury lamp with a light intensity of 85 mW/cm\u00b2.", "reaction medium": "The reaction medium used in the experiment involves a photoreactor with a photocatalyst coated on the inner surface, and the reactants include CO2 and H2O. The system uses a circulating water solution containing sodium nitrite (2.0 M) to filter UV wavelengths and manage heat, along with pure CO2 or mixed N2 gas introduced through water bubblers to saturate the photocatalysts.", "reactor type": "None", "operation mode": "Continuous"}
