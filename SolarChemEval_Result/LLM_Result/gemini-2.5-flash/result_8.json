{"catalyst": "CuO-TiO2 composite catalysts", "co_catalyst": "Based on the text, the catalyst used is a CuO-TiO2 composite catalyst. While not explicitly termed a \"co-catalyst\", CuO is a component added to TiO2 to form the composite, and the text states that the heterojunction between CuO and TiO2 played an important role in enhancing the photocatalytic activity. Therefore, CuO functions in a co-catalytic role within the composite.", "light source": "UV", "lamp": "Mercury", "reaction medium": "Liquid", "reactor type": "Slurry", "operation mode": "Batch"}
