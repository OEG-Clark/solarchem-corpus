{"catalyst": "The text indicates that the experiment involves the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 using ZnO NAgraphene composites. The Abstract states that these composites exhibit high activity in this process, and the Results section describes using \"The obtained ZnO NAgraphene powders (0.1 g)\" in the photoreactor for the CO2 photocatalytic reduction measurement. Therefore, ZnO NAgraphene is the catalyst used.", "co_catalyst": "None", "light source": "UV", "lamp": "None", "reaction medium": "Gas", "reactor type": "Fixed-bed", "operation mode": "Batch"}
