{"catalyst": "Ru nanoparticles (NPs) loaded ketoaminebased COF (TpPa-1) catalysts, named Ru/TpPa-1", "co_catalyst": "None", "light source": "UV", "lamp": "Xenon", "reaction medium": "The isotopic 13 CO 2 reduction was performed in an NMR tube filled with the photocatalyst in a CD 3 CN/TEOA (5:1 in volume ratio) solution. For the reusability test, after the reaction, the photocatalyst was separated from the reaction medium, repeatedly washed with deionized water twice, and then dried overnight in a vacuum oven at 120 C before the next run. A 4 mL Pyrex tube was charged with 1,3,5-triformylphloroglucinol (42 mg) and p-phenylenediamine (32 mg) in 2.35 mL of a 1:1:0.3(volume ratio) solution of 1,4-dioxane, mesitylene, and aqueous acetic acid (3 mol L -1 ).", "reactor type": "None", "operation mode": "None"}
