However, the experiment involves a V2O5/ZnV2O6 heterojunction, and the text discusses the roles and interactions of these two components in the photocatalytic process. It can be inferred that ZnV2O6 acts as a co-catalyst to V2O5.", "light source": "Solar Simulator", "lamp": "Xenon", "reaction medium": "Liquid", "reactor type": "None", "operation mode": "None"}
