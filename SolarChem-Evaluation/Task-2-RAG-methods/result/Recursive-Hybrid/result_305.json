{"catalyst": "The catalyst used in the experiment is not explicitly stated, but the text mentions control experiments were conducted without a catalyst, and the carbon containing products were detected only when gaseous CO2 was introduced into the reaction system, suggesting that CO2 was the only carbon source for the experiment rather than the photodegradation products of catalyst.", "co_catalyst": "None", "light source": "UV-Vis", "lamp": "Mercury-Xenon", "reaction medium": "The reaction medium used in the experiment is liquid, as evidenced by the use of HCl aqueous solution.", "reactor type": "None", "operation mode": "None"}
