{"catalyst": "Pt/TiO2", "co_catalyst": "The text does not explicitly state a co-catalyst used in the experiment. However, it frequently mentions (Pt/TiO2)rGO-n catalysts, suggesting that Pt/TiO2 and rGO are key components, and potentially act as co-catalysts.", "light source": "Xe lamp", "lamp": "Xe lamp", "reaction medium": "Gas", "reactor type": "The text does not explicitly state the reactor type. However, it describes experiments performed in a 'gas-closed circulation system' and a 'conventional flow apparatus' with mention of a 'Harrick IR cell'. These suggest a flow reactor or a similar setup for gas-phase reactions.", "operation mode": "The text does not explicitly state the operation mode (Batch, Continuous, or Batch/Continuous). It describes various experimental setups and procedures, but doesn't define a specific operational mode."}
