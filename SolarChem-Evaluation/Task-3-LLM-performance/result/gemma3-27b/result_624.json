{"catalyst": "TiO2 (specifically, commercial TiO2-P25 and synthesized TiO2 nanoparticles) is used as the catalyst in the experiment. The synthesis also involves using titanium tetraisopropoxide (TTIP) as a precursor.", "co_catalyst": "TiO2-P25 is used as a benchmark catalyst in the experiment. The text details the preparation and doping of other catalysts, but TiO2-P25 serves as the primary reference point for comparison.", "light source": "70 W mercury lamp", "lamp": "Mercury lamp", "reaction medium": "Liquid", "reactor type": "Fixed-bed", "operation mode": "Continuous"}
