{"catalyst": "A 300 W Xe lamp providing simulated sunlight is used as the light source in the experiment. A 150W Xe lamp at 400 V is also used for fluorescence measurements.", "co_catalyst": "The experiment does not mention a co-catalyst. It details the materials used (g-C3N4 and Bi2O2BO2(OH)) and the process of CO2 reduction, but doesn't specify any additional co-catalyst beyond these two components.", "light source": "300 W Xe lamp", "lamp": "Xe lamp", "reaction medium": "The experiment was conducted in a gas-solid reaction system with deionized water and H2SO4 (0.1mol/L) as the reaction medium.", "reactor type": "Pyrex vacuumed sealed glass reactor", "operation mode": "Continuous"}
