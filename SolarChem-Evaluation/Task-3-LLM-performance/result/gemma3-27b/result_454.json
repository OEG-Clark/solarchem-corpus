{"catalyst": "Ag/CdS is used as the catalyst in the experiment. The text details the photocatalytic CO and H2 production using Ag/CdS catalysts with varying Ag loading amounts.", "co_catalyst": "TEOA", "light source": "Visible light", "lamp": "Xe lamp with a 420 nm cutoff filter", "reaction medium": "The reaction medium used in the experiment is a mixture of H2O and TEOA. Specifically, 4 mL of H2O and 2 mL of TEOA are used in a Schlenk flask reactor.", "reactor type": "Schlenk flask", "operation mode": "The text does not explicitly state the operation mode (Batch, Continuous, or Batch/Continuous). It describes a series of experiments conducted in a vacuum oven, with measurements taken over time (cyclic runs, stability tests), but doesn't define a specific operational mode."}
