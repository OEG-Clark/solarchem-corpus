Furthermore, the Raman spectra of all samples, including pure STO, 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO, and 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO, were measured (Fig. S1).Of note, the strong peak at 175 cm A1 is a longitudinal phonon mode.The intense peak at 251 cm A1 is a transverse optical polar mode.Two peaks denote the translational shake of Sr against TiO 6 octahedron.The peak at 543 cm A1 represents the vibrational deformation of oxygen in SrTiO 3-x .The Raman spectra of all samples show a band centered at approximately 791 cm A1 , which denotes the ordered distribution of metal cations of the perovskite structure.24,25 Moreover, the Raman spectra of the three samples proved that the doping of the Bi element exerted no significant changes in the perovskite structure of SrTiO 3-x . XPS test was performed to ascertain the elementary composition and the surface states of pure STO, 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO, and 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples.The C 1 s peak line to 284.6 eV served as a reference to adjust for the XPS analysis.Fig. 1c shows the XPS survey spectra.Results showed that Sr, Ti, and O elements exist in pure STO, while Sr, Ti, O, and Bi elements exist in the 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO and 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples, respectively.The source of C elements in all samples is the surface contamination during the test.Fig. 1d shows the element spectrum of Sr 3d.The peaks at 132.5 eV and 134.2 eV corresponds to Sr 3d 5/2 and Sr 3d 3/2 respectively.26 Fig. 1e illustrates the element spectrum of Ti 2p.The peaks at 458.5 eV, 458.9 eV, 463.6 eV, and 464.8 eV ascribed to Ti 3 2p 3/2 , Ti 4 2p 3/2 , Ti 4 2p 1/2 , Ti 4 2p 1/2 , respectively.27 The two peaks value of Ti 3 in the pure STO samples is relatively low, demonstrating that the content of Ti 3 is few.However, the two peaks value of Ti 3 increased significantly after doping Bi elements, indicating that the Ti 3 content increased.Fig. 1f is outlines the element spectrum of O 1 s.The peaks at 529.6 eV, 530.3 eV, and 531.7 eV are indexed to water adsorption, oxygen vacancy, and the Ti-O band, respectively.27 As depicted in Fig. 1f, the content of oxygen vacancy in pure STO samples is few.Of note, the oxygen vacancy concentration of 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO and 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples increases after doping Bi elements.These results demonstrate that doping Bi elements further improves the formation of oxygen vacancies.Fig. 1g illustrates the element spectrum of Bi 4f;, the peaks at 158.5 eV and 163.7 eV are distributed to Bi 4f 7/2 and Bi 4f 5/2 , respectively.28 The XPS results provide evidence of the successful incorporation of Bi into SrTiO 3-x nanosheets.In addition, the EPR spectra of pure STO, 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO, and 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples were tested.Fig. 1h shows four distinct signal peaks.The signal peaks at 1.978 and 1.997 are attributed to Ti 3 .The signal peaks at 2.003 and 2.011 are indexed to oxygen vacancy.15,29 The Ti 3 peak and oxygen vacancy peak of pure STO samples are relatively weak.These observations demonstrate that the SrTiO 3-x nanosheets have oxygen vacancies.Also, the appearance of oxygen vacancy is related to ethylene glycol.The Ti 3 peak and oxygen vacancy peaks of 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO and 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples were enhanced significantly by doping SrTiO 3- x nanosheets with Bi element.Ti 3 contents and oxygen vacancy in 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples are more than in 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO samples.Bi 3 has a different radius from that of Sr 2 and Ti 4 .When Bi 3 replaces Sr 2 and Ti 4 , the lattice parameters changes, and the crystal structure is distorted.The resultant lattice distortion causes oxygen vacancies, increasing the oxygen vacancy concentration of 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO and 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples.Mounting evidence shows that oxygen vacancy also exerts an essential effect on photocatalytic performance.293031 Proper oxygen vacancy can improve light absorption and facilitate the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes. Morphology impacts the performance of the photocatalysts.Here, pure STO, 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO, and 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples were observed by SEM, TEM, HRTEM, and AFM.Fig. 2a-2f shows SEM and TEM images of pure STO, 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO, and 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples.Pure STO is an irregular nanosheet.Notably, after pure STO was doped by Bi, 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO and 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples formed an irregular nanosheet.The size of the samples is about 100 nm, and their thickness was characterized by the AFM test.The thickness of pure STO, 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO, and 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples were 9.541 nm, 8.619 nm, and 9.168 nm, respectively (Fig. 3a-3f).These results demonstrated that Bi doping does not impact the morphology and thickness of the SrTiO 3-x nanosheets.Ethylene glycol in the hydrothermal solvent exerts a decisive effect on SrTiO 3-x morphology.Ethylene glycol is an organic solute with two hydroxyl groups, and SrTiO 3-x exhibits a cubic perovskite structure.Although the initial size of SrTiO 3-x is uniform when it forms a crystal nucleus, the adsorption energy of each crystal plane is different.The hydroxyl groups of ethylene glycol are readily adsorbed on the (1 1 0) crystal plane of SrTiO 3-x .As a result, the SrTiO 3-x nanocrystals grow along the (1 1 0) crystal plane.The SrTiO 3-x nanosheets grow and form a 2D morphology with the extension of hydrothermal time.32,33 The two-dimensional (2D) structure provides a large specific surface and a large number of low-coordination surface atoms beneficial to light adsorption and CO 2 adsorption.The thinness of 2D materials significantly shortens the migration distance of photogenerated carriers from the internal to the surface and reduces the photogenerated carries recombination, benefiting the photocatalytic process.34 There- fore, a 2D nanosheet structure is better for photocatalysts than nanoparticle or nanofiber structures.Fig. 2g-2i shows HRTEM images of pure STO, 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO, and 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples.The lattice spacing of pure STO, 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO, and 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples are 0.276 nm, 0.271 nm, and 0.278 nm, respectively; these are assigned to the (1 1 0) planes.Bi 3 ionic radius is larger than Ti 4 and smaller than Sr 2 , respectively.In this view, the lattice spacing of 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO is larger than that of pure STO, whereas the lattice spacing of 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO is smaller than that of pure STO.These data concur with XRD results.Fig. S2 shows EDX mapping images of pure STO, 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO, and 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples, in which Sr, Ti, O, and Bi elements are evenly distributed.These results provide evidence of successful replacement of Sr and Ti with Bi in SrTiO 3-x . Light absorption properties of all samples were tested to explore the influence of Bi doping on the band structure of SrTiO 3- x nanosheets.Fig. 4a shows the UV-visible absorption spectra of X-Bi-Sr-STO samples; the cut-off absorption edge of pure STO samples is 390 nm.When Bi atom replaced Sr atom, the absorption spectra of all samples were red-shifted, and the visible light absorption was enhanced.Fig. 4b displays the UV-visible absorption spectra of X-Bi-Ti-STO samples.Similar results were obtained when the Bi atom replaced the Ti atom, whereby the absorption spectra of all samples were red-shifted, and the visible light absorption was enhanced.Pure STO, 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO, and 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO were selected to compare the light absorbtion properties of samples directly.As shown in Fig. 4c, regardless of whether Sr atom or Ti atom is replaced by Bi atom, the light absorption edge of 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO and 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples is red-shifted, and the visible light absorption is enhanced.Fig. 4d shows the bandgap converted from the absorption spectra; the bandgap of pure STO, 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO, and 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples are 3.27 eV, 3.24 eV, and 3.25 eV, respectively.Fig. 4e shows the valence band spectra of pure STO, 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO, and 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples; the valence band position of pure STO, 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO, and 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples are 1.89 eV, 2.02 eV, and 2.05 eV, respectively. Combined with the valence band of XPS, the conduct band positions of pure STO, 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO, and 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples are A1.38 eV, A1.22 eV, and A1.20 eV, respectively.Fig. 4f illustrates the estimated relative band positions of pure STO, 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO, and 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples.These data strongly demonstrate that Bi doping impacts the band structure of SrTiO 3-x nanosheets.Notably, the concentration of oxygen vacancy in samples increases after doping with Bi element, regardless of whether Bi atom replaces Sr atom or Ti atom.At the same time, the band gap of 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO and 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples is decreased.The conduction band and valence band move down.All these factors contribute to the improvement of the photocatalytic performance of SrTiO 3-x nanosheets. Furthermore, to explore the influence of Bi doping on the band structure of SrTiO 3-x nanosheets, theoretical calculations of band structure and density of states were performed for pure STO, 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO, and 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples.Fig. S3a,S3c, and S3e demonstrate the band structures of pure STO, 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO, and 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples, respectively.The minimum conduct band and the maximum valence band of the three samples are not located at the same point.Evidence shows that pure STO, 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO, and 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples are indirect bandgap semiconductors.35 The calculated band-gap of the three samples were 3.06 eV, 2.79 eV, and 2.66 eV, respectively.The actual bandgap of the three samples were 3.27 eV, 3.24 eV, and 3.25 eV, respectively.The calculated bandgap is smaller than the experimental result, which is ascribed to the limitations of GGA and concur with the theoretical results.The bandgap reduction contributes to improving the light absorption efficiency of photocatalysts.edge comprises Ti 3d, Sr 4d, O 2p, Bi 6 s, and Bi 6p.Additionally, 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO conduct band edge comprises Ti 3d, Bi 6p, and O 2p, whereas valence band edge comprises Ti 3d, Sr 4d, O 2p, and Bi 6 s.Of note, the valence band edge of 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO and 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO moved to the low energy after doping with the Bi element.Due to doping Bi element, the hybridization of Ti, Bi, and O atoms in the valence band of 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO and 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO is low degree.The migration of photogenerated electrons from the crystal to the surface is advantageous.The theoretical calculation results provided evidence that doping of Bi element promotes the absorption of visible light and can effectively block photogenerated electron-hole recombination.These factors improve photocatalytic efficiency. Fig. 5a and 5b illustrate the CO 2 reduction performance of pure STO, X-Bi-Sr-STO, and X-Bi-Ti-STO samples under visible light.The CO 2 reduction products of all samples include CO and CH 4 , in which CO is the main product, and the amount of CH 4 is relatively small.As demonstrated in Fig. 5a, the pure STO nanosheets exhibit excellent photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance under visible light.The CO and CH 4 yields of pure STO samples are 3.12 umol/ g/h and 0.46 umol/g/h, respectively.The yields were attributed mainly to oxygen vacancy and the thin 2D morphology.The synergy of oxygen vacancy and 2D nanosheet structure enhanced visible light absorption and promoted the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs.Of note, when Bi replaced Sr, the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance of all samples weakened with the increase of Bi concentration.At the same time, the generation of CO gradually decreased, whereas CH 4 production has no change nearly.These data demonstrate that substitution of Sr site by Bi is unconducive to the photocatalytic performance of SrTiO 3-x nanosheet.When Bi replaced Ti, the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance of all samples was enhanced.As demonstrated in Fig. 5b, CO and CH 4 production increased with the increase of Bi element concentration.Furthermore, 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples exhibited the best photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance at 1.0 Bi content.The yield of CO and CH 4 were 5.58 umol/g/h and 0.36 umol/g/h, respectively.The substitution of the Ti site by Bi benefited the photocatalytic performance of the SrTiO 3-x nanosheet.According to the experimental results, the substitution of the Bi atom for different positions in SrTiO 3-x nanosheet exerted an opposite effect on the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction capacity.Compared with previous visible light photocatalytic CO 2 reduction work, 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO sample has a significant advantage in photocatalytic performance (Table S1). The main factors influencing photocatalytic CO 2 reduction include the photocatalyst band structure and the adsorption and activation of CO 2 on the photocatalyst surface.Here, photocatalytic H 2 production and CO 2 absorption of pure STO, 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO, and 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples were tested to explore the influence of different sites on SrTiO3-x nanosheet on its photocatalytic performance.The photocatalytic H 2 production results are presented in Fig. S4a andS4b.The photocatalytic H 2 production performance of pure STO, 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO, and 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples was 10.6 mmol/g/h, 91.6 mmol/g/h, and 93.5 mmol/g/h, respectively.Of note, doping the Bi element significantly improved the photocatalytic H 2 production performance of 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO and 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples.Combined with the results shown in Fig. 4, regardless of whether the Bi atom replaces Sr atom or Ti atom, the bandgap is reduced, and oxygen vacancy concentration is increased appropriately.These conditions are conducive to photocatalytic reactions. The CO 2 adsorption capacity is one of the critical factors in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction.36,37 The CO 2 physical adsorption properties in pure STO, 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO, and 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples are shown in Fig. 6a.For pure STO samples, the CO 2 physical adsorption gradually increased with the growing relative pressure.The increase was fast when the value of p/p0 was in the 0-0.1 stage and slowed in the 0.1-1 stage.For 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO samples, the CO 2 physical adsorption gradually increased when the value of p/p 0 was in the 0-0.3 stage.However, the adsorption amount remained unchanged in the 0.3-1 stage.For 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples, the increase was fast when the value of p/p 0 was in the 0-0.1 stage and slowed in the 0.1-1 stage.Throughout the entire process, the CO 2 physical adsorption of pure STO samples was always more substantial than that of 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO and 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples.This observation demonstrated that doping of the Bi element in SrTiO 3-x was unfavorable to the CO 2 physical adsorption on the photocatalyst surface.Fig. 6b illustrates the temperature-programmed desorption of CO 2 adsorption performance of pure STO, 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO, and 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples.In the field between 50 C and 200 C, the desorption peak of CO 2 represents the physical adsorption on the photocatalyst surface.In the field between 200 C and 600 C, the desorption peak of CO 2 represents chemisorption on the photocatalyst surface.38,39 Of note, there was no considerable difference between the three samples in 50 C-200 C (Fig. 6b).However, the desorption peaks of the three samples had a significant difference between 200 C and 600 C.Moreover, the peak intensity of the pure STO and 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples were consistent, all higher than the peak value of the 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO samples.These observations indicate that the pure STO and 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples had better chemisorption of CO 2 than the 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO samples.In this view substituting the Bi atom for Sr or Ti atom at different positions in STO exerts different effects on the CO 2 chemisorption of the photocatalyst.Studies have found that the Sr site is the active site of CO 2 adsorption in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction.40 Therefore, replacing the Sr atom with the Bi atom reduces the active sites on the STO surface, impacting the CO 2 adsorption and weakening the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance of STO.However, when the Bi atom replaces the Ti atom, the active site of the Sr atom and CO 2 adsorption remains unaffected.This consequently improves the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance of STO.Also, the CO 2 adsorption data support the results of the CO 2 reduction performance of the previous samples. In addition, the CO 2 adsorption on the surfaces of pure STO, Bi-Sr-STO, and Bi-Ti-STO was calculated to explore the influence of replacing different positions with Bi atom on CO 2 adsorption.Fig. 6c shows the charge difference distributions of CO 2 adsorption on the three samples.When CO 2 was adsorbed on the surface of the pure STO sample, electron accumulation areas were formed near O atom close to Sr atom in CO 2 molecules, whereas electron depletion areas were formed in other areas.These results demonstrate that CO 2 adsorption on the surface of pure STO induces the flow of electrons from other nearby atoms to O atoms of CO 2 molecules.This scenario is conducive to the activation and photocatalytic reaction of CO 2 molecules.For the Bi-Sr-STO samples, CO 2 adsorption on the sample surface induces the electron flow in a different direction from that of pure STO.Notably, the electron accumulation area formed between the two Bi atoms, whereas the other areas formed the electron depletion area.At the same time, electrons of nearby other atoms flow to the region between the two Bi atoms rather than CO 2 molecules, which is not conducive to subsequent activation of CO 2 molecules.This blocks the photocatalytic reaction.Regarding the Bi-Ti-STO sample, electron flow was almost identical to that of the pure STO sample following CO 2 adsorption on the sample surface.However, the flow of electrons from nearby atoms to O atoms of CO 2 molecules promotes further CO 2 activation.The above calculation results were completely in agreement with the experimental phenomena.These data also demonstrate that the Sr atom in STO is the active site for CO 2 adsorption, playings a significant role in CO 2 reduction.In view of band structure, Bi doping can reduce the band gap of SrTiO 3-x nanosheets, enhance light absorption and promote the separation of photogenerated carriers.In terms of CO 2 activation, the Sr site is the active site of SrTiO 3-x nanosheets.Replacing Sr atom with Bi atom weakened the adsorption and activation of CO 2 on the surface of the SrTiO 3-x nanosheet.This ultimately inhibited the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction.However, there was no adverse effect on the adsorption and activation of CO 2 when Bi atoms replaced Ti atoms.These data demonstratea need to consider band structure and CO 2 adsorption when improving photocatalytic CO 2 reduction efficiency. The conditions for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction and the C sources in the products are concerned.The photocatalytic reduc-tion of CO 2 was carried out in the dark, without the use of a catalyst, and with N 2 instead of CO 2 .As shown in Fig. S5a, no products were formed when 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples were used as a photocatalyst in the absence of light.Therefore, light irradiation is an essential prerequisite for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction.If the remainder of the reduction process is left constant, no catalyst is added, and no products are formed.This implies that photocatalyst is also requirement for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.When CO 2 is substituted for N 2 , no product is formed.It has been suggested that the source of C in the product is CO 2 .The stability of the photocatalyst is also a critical aspect in determining the performance of the photocatalyst.Fig. S5b shows four photocatalytic CO 2 reduction cycles using 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples.After four cycles, the photocatalyst still exhibited excellent photocatalytic CO 2 conversion performance.Fig. S6 illustrates the XRD patterns of a 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO sample before and after cycling.The structure of the 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO nanosheet remained unchanged before and after the photocatalytic reaction.Fig. S7 shows the SEM before and after cycling for a 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO sample.As seen in the figure, the microstructure of the 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO sample remained unchanged during the photocatalytic reaction.It retained the nanosheet morphology.These findings implied that the Bi atom that substituted for the Ti atom in SrTiO 3-x nanosheets was stable. The optoelectronic properties of photocatalysts were investigated to determine the effect of Bi doping on the generation, separation, and transportation of photogenerated electron-hole.The time-resolved PL decay curves and fitted parameters for pure STO, 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO, and 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples are shown in Fig. 7a and Table 1.s 1 is the non-radiative process, whereas s 2 is a radiative process.s denotes the average lifetime.The average lifetimes of pure STO, 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO, and 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples were 2.5705 ns, 2.9518 ns, and 2.9903 ns, respectively (Table 1).It was hypothesized that doping the Bi element effectively inhibits the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes.To further investigate the effect of Bi doping on the separation efficiency of photogenerated electrons and holes a surface photovoltage spectra were acquired.The SPV spectra of pure STO, 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO, and 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples are shown in Fig. 7b.In comparison to steady-state PL spectra, the higher the peak value of the sample, the greater the efficiency of photogenerated electron-hole separation.Three samples showed pronounced peaks at 320 nm.The peak value for samples containing 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples was the highest.The pure STO sample had the lowest peak value.It suggested that Bi doping restrained the composition of photogenerated electron-hole pairs.414243 The photocurrent of pure STO, 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO, and 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples are shown in Fig. S8a.Pure STO samples had the low- est photocurrent intensity.When Bi replaced Sr and Ti, the photocurrent intensity of 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO and 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples was significantly increased, while the photocurrent remained relatively stable.It demonstrated that regardless of whether Bi replaced Sr or Ti in SrTiO 3 , the generation and separation of photogenerated carriers were promoted.44,45 Nyquist impedance plots of pure STO, 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO, and 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples are shown in Fig. S8b.The radius of pure STO samples was the largest, while the radius of 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO and 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples were smaller than that of pure STO samples.This demonstrated that after doping the Bi element, the charge transfer resistance of the photocatalyst decreased and the transfer efficiency of the interface charge on the contact surface increased.46 Fig. S8c illustrates the steady-state PL spectra of the three samples.Three samples showed significant absorption peaks at 438 nm.The absorption peak of pure STO samples was the highest, indicating the highest photogenerated electron-hole pair composition rates.The absorption peaks of 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO and 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples were significantly reduced when Bi replaced Sr or Ti, demonstrating that doping Bi element could prevent recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes.47 All experimental findings demonstrated that doping with Bi significantly hindered photogenerated carriers' recombination and increased absorption of visible light.When Bi atom replaced Sr atom or Ti atom, the degree of hybridization between Bi, Ti, and O atoms in the valence band was very low.The migration of photogenerated electrons from the crystal to the surface is favorable.On the other hand, the oxygen vacancy concentration in the sample increased, and the oxygen vacancies acted as photogenerated electrons traps.It prevented the recombination of photogenerated carriers during the separation and migration of photogenerated electrons and holes.Therefore, the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance was improved. The path of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction has always been the focus.Therefore, the intermediates in the photocatalytic process of 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples were determined by in-situ FTIR spectroscopy.Fig. 8a shows the spectra of 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples after a 10 min dark reaction in a dark chamber.The following were the observed peaks: 1203 cm A1 , 1315 cm A1 , 1384 cm A1 , 1502 cm A1 , 1565 cm A1 and 1650 cm A1 .The peak at 1203 cm A1 was indexed to HCO 3 -and the peak intensity continued to increase.40 The peak at 1315 cm A1 was ascribed to CO 3 2-, 48 and the peak intensity increased gradually.The 1384 cm A1 peak was attributed to the CAO stretch in COOH, which is constantly enhanced and slightly shifted to the left.49 The peak at 1502 cm A1 was assigned to CO 3 2-, which gradually disappeared.50 The 1565 cm A1 peak was COO -, which gradually increased and gradually shifted to the left. 49 The 1650 cm A1 peak was associated with the HAOAH bend, which existed initially, but gradually disappeared.51 The spectra of 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples for CO 2 reduction after dark reaction are shown in Fig. 8b.The spectra obtained under light conditions dif- fered from those obtained under dark conditions, suggesting that the material on the surface of the photocatalyst changed in response to light.The peak at 1207 cm A1 corresponded to HCO 3 -, 40 while the peak at 1319 cm A1 was CO 3 2-, 48 and the peak value gradually increased.The peak value at 1608 cm A1 gradually shifted to 1564 cm A1 as the amount of light increased, indicating that the intermediate product gradually changed from HCO 3 -to COO -. 49,52 The peak at 1697 cm A1 was attributed to the CO stretch in COOH, and the peak gradually increased.53 According to the analysis of the above results, the intermediates of 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction included HCO 3 -, CO 3 2-, COO -, and COOH.According to earlier experimental results, the primary product of this reaction was CO, with a minimal amount of CH 4 .The possible mechanism of STO photocatalytic CO 2 reduction is shown in scheme 2.

Furthermore, the Raman spectra of all samples, including pure STO, 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO, and 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO, were measured (Fig. S1).Of note, the strong peak at 175 cm A1 is a longitudinal phonon mode.The intense peak at 251 cm A1 is a transverse optical polar mode.Two peaks denote the translational shake of Sr against TiO 6 octahedron.The peak at 543 cm A1 represents the vibrational deformation of oxygen in SrTiO 3-x .The Raman spectra of all samples show a band centered at approximately 791 cm A1 , which denotes the ordered distribution of metal cations of the perovskite structure.24,25 Moreover, the Raman spectra of the three samples proved that the doping of the Bi element exerted no significant changes in the perovskite structure of SrTiO 3-x . XPS test was performed to ascertain the elementary composition and the surface states of pure STO, 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO, and 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples.The C 1 s peak line to 284.6 eV served as a reference to adjust for the XPS analysis.Fig. 1c shows the XPS survey spectra.Results showed that Sr, Ti, and O elements exist in pure STO, while Sr, Ti, O, and Bi elements exist in the 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO and 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples, respectively.The source of C elements in all samples is the surface contamination during the test.Fig. 1d shows the element spectrum of Sr 3d.The peaks at 132.5 eV and 134.2 eV corresponds to Sr 3d 5/2 and Sr 3d 3/2 respectively.26 Fig. 1e illustrates the element spectrum of Ti 2p.The peaks at 458.5 eV, 458.9 eV, 463.6 eV, and 464.8 eV ascribed to Ti 3 2p 3/2 , Ti 4 2p 3/2 , Ti 4 2p 1/2 , Ti 4 2p 1/2 , respectively.27 The two peaks value of Ti 3 in the pure STO samples is relatively low, demonstrating that the content of Ti 3 is few.However, the two peaks value of Ti 3 increased significantly after doping Bi elements, indicating that the Ti 3 content increased.Fig. 1f is outlines the element spectrum of O 1 s.The peaks at 529.6 eV, 530.3 eV, and 531.7 eV are indexed to water adsorption, oxygen vacancy, and the Ti-O band, respectively.27 As depicted in Fig. 1f, the content of oxygen vacancy in pure STO samples is few.Of note, the oxygen vacancy concentration of 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO and 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples increases after doping Bi elements.These results demonstrate that doping Bi elements further improves the formation of oxygen vacancies.Fig. 1g illustrates the element spectrum of Bi 4f;, the peaks at 158.5 eV and 163.7 eV are distributed to Bi 4f 7/2 and Bi 4f 5/2 , respectively.28 The XPS results provide evidence of the successful incorporation of Bi into SrTiO 3-x nanosheets.In addition, the EPR spectra of pure STO, 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO, and 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples were tested.Fig. 1h shows four distinct signal peaks.The signal peaks at 1.978 and 1.997 are attributed to Ti 3 .The signal peaks at 2.003 and 2.011 are indexed to oxygen vacancy.15,29 The Ti 3 peak and oxygen vacancy peak of pure STO samples are relatively weak.These observations demonstrate that the SrTiO 3-x nanosheets have oxygen vacancies.Also, the appearance of oxygen vacancy is related to ethylene glycol.The Ti 3 peak and oxygen vacancy peaks of 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO and 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples were enhanced significantly by doping SrTiO 3- x nanosheets with Bi element.Ti 3 contents and oxygen vacancy in 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples are more than in 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO samples.Bi 3 has a different radius from that of Sr 2 and Ti 4 .When Bi 3 replaces Sr 2 and Ti 4 , the lattice parameters changes, and the crystal structure is distorted.The resultant lattice distortion causes oxygen vacancies, increasing the oxygen vacancy concentration of 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO and 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples.Mounting evidence shows that oxygen vacancy also exerts an essential effect on photocatalytic performance.293031 Proper oxygen vacancy can improve light absorption and facilitate the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes. Morphology impacts the performance of the photocatalysts.Here, pure STO, 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO, and 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples were observed by SEM, TEM, HRTEM, and AFM.Fig. 2a-2f shows SEM and TEM images of pure STO, 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO, and 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples.Pure STO is an irregular nanosheet.Notably, after pure STO was doped by Bi, 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO and 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples formed an irregular nanosheet.The size of the samples is about 100 nm, and their thickness was characterized by the AFM test.The thickness of pure STO, 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO, and 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples were 9.541 nm, 8.619 nm, and 9.168 nm, respectively (Fig. 3a-3f).These results demonstrated that Bi doping does not impact the morphology and thickness of the SrTiO 3-x nanosheets.Ethylene glycol in the hydrothermal solvent exerts a decisive effect on SrTiO 3-x morphology.Ethylene glycol is an organic solute with two hydroxyl groups, and SrTiO 3-x exhibits a cubic perovskite structure.Although the initial size of SrTiO 3-x is uniform when it forms a crystal nucleus, the adsorption energy of each crystal plane is different.The hydroxyl groups of ethylene glycol are readily adsorbed on the (1 1 0) crystal plane of SrTiO 3-x .As a result, the SrTiO 3-x nanocrystals grow along the (1 1 0) crystal plane.The SrTiO 3-x nanosheets grow and form a 2D morphology with the extension of hydrothermal time.32,33 The two-dimensional (2D) structure provides a large specific surface and a large number of low-coordination surface atoms beneficial to light adsorption and CO 2 adsorption.The thinness of 2D materials significantly shortens the migration distance of photogenerated carriers from the internal to the surface and reduces the photogenerated carries recombination, benefiting the photocatalytic process.34 There- fore, a 2D nanosheet structure is better for photocatalysts than nanoparticle or nanofiber structures.Fig. 2g-2i shows HRTEM images of pure STO, 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO, and 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples.The lattice spacing of pure STO, 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO, and 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples are 0.276 nm, 0.271 nm, and 0.278 nm, respectively; these are assigned to the (1 1 0) planes.Bi 3 ionic radius is larger than Ti 4 and smaller than Sr 2 , respectively.In this view, the lattice spacing of 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO is larger than that of pure STO, whereas the lattice spacing of 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO is smaller than that of pure STO.These data concur with XRD results.Fig. S2 shows EDX mapping images of pure STO, 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO, and 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples, in which Sr, Ti, O, and Bi elements are evenly distributed.These results provide evidence of successful replacement of Sr and Ti with Bi in SrTiO 3-x . Light absorption properties of all samples were tested to explore the influence of Bi doping on the band structure of SrTiO 3- x nanosheets.Fig. 4a shows the UV-visible absorption spectra of X-Bi-Sr-STO samples; the cut-off absorption edge of pure STO samples is 390 nm.When Bi atom replaced Sr atom, the absorption spectra of all samples were red-shifted, and the visible light absorption was enhanced.Fig. 4b displays the UV-visible absorption spectra of X-Bi-Ti-STO samples.Similar results were obtained when the Bi atom replaced the Ti atom, whereby the absorption spectra of all samples were red-shifted, and the visible light absorption was enhanced.Pure STO, 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO, and 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO were selected to compare the light absorbtion properties of samples directly.As shown in Fig. 4c, regardless of whether Sr atom or Ti atom is replaced by Bi atom, the light absorption edge of 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO and 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples is red-shifted, and the visible light absorption is enhanced.Fig. 4d shows the bandgap converted from the absorption spectra; the bandgap of pure STO, 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO, and 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples are 3.27 eV, 3.24 eV, and 3.25 eV, respectively.Fig. 4e shows the valence band spectra of pure STO, 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO, and 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples; the valence band position of pure STO, 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO, and 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples are 1.89 eV, 2.02 eV, and 2.05 eV, respectively. Combined with the valence band of XPS, the conduct band positions of pure STO, 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO, and 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples are A1.38 eV, A1.22 eV, and A1.20 eV, respectively.Fig. 4f illustrates the estimated relative band positions of pure STO, 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO, and 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples.These data strongly demonstrate that Bi doping impacts the band structure of SrTiO 3-x nanosheets.Notably, the concentration of oxygen vacancy in samples increases after doping with Bi element, regardless of whether Bi atom replaces Sr atom or Ti atom.At the same time, the band gap of 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO and 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples is decreased.The conduction band and valence band move down.All these factors contribute to the improvement of the photocatalytic performance of SrTiO 3-x nanosheets. Furthermore, to explore the influence of Bi doping on the band structure of SrTiO 3-x nanosheets, theoretical calculations of band structure and density of states were performed for pure STO, 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO, and 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples.Fig. S3a,S3c, and S3e demonstrate the band structures of pure STO, 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO, and 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples, respectively.The minimum conduct band and the maximum valence band of the three samples are not located at the same point.Evidence shows that pure STO, 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO, and 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples are indirect bandgap semiconductors.35 The calculated band-gap of the three samples were 3.06 eV, 2.79 eV, and 2.66 eV, respectively.The actual bandgap of the three samples were 3.27 eV, 3.24 eV, and 3.25 eV, respectively.The calculated bandgap is smaller than the experimental result, which is ascribed to the limitations of GGA and concur with the theoretical results.The bandgap reduction contributes to improving the light absorption efficiency of photocatalysts.edge comprises Ti 3d, Sr 4d, O 2p, Bi 6 s, and Bi 6p.Additionally, 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO conduct band edge comprises Ti 3d, Bi 6p, and O 2p, whereas valence band edge comprises Ti 3d, Sr 4d, O 2p, and Bi 6 s.Of note, the valence band edge of 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO and 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO moved to the low energy after doping with the Bi element.Due to doping Bi element, the hybridization of Ti, Bi, and O atoms in the valence band of 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO and 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO is low degree.The migration of photogenerated electrons from the crystal to the surface is advantageous.The theoretical calculation results provided evidence that doping of Bi element promotes the absorption of visible light and can effectively block photogenerated electron-hole recombination.These factors improve photocatalytic efficiency. Fig. 5a and 5b illustrate the CO 2 reduction performance of pure STO, X-Bi-Sr-STO, and X-Bi-Ti-STO samples under visible light.The CO 2 reduction products of all samples include CO and CH 4 , in which CO is the main product, and the amount of CH 4 is relatively small.As demonstrated in Fig. 5a, the pure STO nanosheets exhibit excellent photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance under visible light.The CO and CH 4 yields of pure STO samples are 3.12 umol/ g/h and 0.46 umol/g/h, respectively.The yields were attributed mainly to oxygen vacancy and the thin 2D morphology.The synergy of oxygen vacancy and 2D nanosheet structure enhanced visible light absorption and promoted the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs.Of note, when Bi replaced Sr, the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance of all samples weakened with the increase of Bi concentration.At the same time, the generation of CO gradually decreased, whereas CH 4 production has no change nearly.These data demonstrate that substitution of Sr site by Bi is unconducive to the photocatalytic performance of SrTiO 3-x nanosheet.When Bi replaced Ti, the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance of all samples was enhanced.As demonstrated in Fig. 5b, CO and CH 4 production increased with the increase of Bi element concentration.Furthermore, 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples exhibited the best photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance at 1.0 Bi content.The yield of CO and CH 4 were 5.58 umol/g/h and 0.36 umol/g/h, respectively.The substitution of the Ti site by Bi benefited the photocatalytic performance of the SrTiO 3-x nanosheet.According to the experimental results, the substitution of the Bi atom for different positions in SrTiO 3-x nanosheet exerted an opposite effect on the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction capacity.Compared with previous visible light photocatalytic CO 2 reduction work, 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO sample has a significant advantage in photocatalytic performance (Table S1). The main factors influencing photocatalytic CO 2 reduction include the photocatalyst band structure and the adsorption and activation of CO 2 on the photocatalyst surface.Here, photocatalytic H 2 production and CO 2 absorption of pure STO, 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO, and 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples were tested to explore the influence of different sites on SrTiO3-x nanosheet on its photocatalytic performance.The photocatalytic H 2 production results are presented in Fig. S4a andS4b.The photocatalytic H 2 production performance of pure STO, 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO, and 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples was 10.6 mmol/g/h, 91.6 mmol/g/h, and 93.5 mmol/g/h, respectively.Of note, doping the Bi element significantly improved the photocatalytic H 2 production performance of 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO and 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples.Combined with the results shown in Fig. 4, regardless of whether the Bi atom replaces Sr atom or Ti atom, the bandgap is reduced, and oxygen vacancy concentration is increased appropriately.These conditions are conducive to photocatalytic reactions. The CO 2 adsorption capacity is one of the critical factors in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction.36,37 The CO 2 physical adsorption properties in pure STO, 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO, and 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples are shown in Fig. 6a.For pure STO samples, the CO 2 physical adsorption gradually increased with the growing relative pressure.The increase was fast when the value of p/p0 was in the 0-0.1 stage and slowed in the 0.1-1 stage.For 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO samples, the CO 2 physical adsorption gradually increased when the value of p/p 0 was in the 0-0.3 stage.However, the adsorption amount remained unchanged in the 0.3-1 stage.For 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples, the increase was fast when the value of p/p 0 was in the 0-0.1 stage and slowed in the 0.1-1 stage.Throughout the entire process, the CO 2 physical adsorption of pure STO samples was always more substantial than that of 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO and 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples.This observation demonstrated that doping of the Bi element in SrTiO 3-x was unfavorable to the CO 2 physical adsorption on the photocatalyst surface.Fig. 6b illustrates the temperature-programmed desorption of CO 2 adsorption performance of pure STO, 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO, and 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples.In the field between 50 C and 200 C, the desorption peak of CO 2 represents the physical adsorption on the photocatalyst surface.In the field between 200 C and 600 C, the desorption peak of CO 2 represents chemisorption on the photocatalyst surface.38,39 Of note, there was no considerable difference between the three samples in 50 C-200 C (Fig. 6b).However, the desorption peaks of the three samples had a significant difference between 200 C and 600 C.Moreover, the peak intensity of the pure STO and 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples were consistent, all higher than the peak value of the 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO samples.These observations indicate that the pure STO and 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples had better chemisorption of CO 2 than the 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO samples.In this view substituting the Bi atom for Sr or Ti atom at different positions in STO exerts different effects on the CO 2 chemisorption of the photocatalyst.Studies have found that the Sr site is the active site of CO 2 adsorption in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction.40 Therefore, replacing the Sr atom with the Bi atom reduces the active sites on the STO surface, impacting the CO 2 adsorption and weakening the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance of STO.However, when the Bi atom replaces the Ti atom, the active site of the Sr atom and CO 2 adsorption remains unaffected.This consequently improves the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance of STO.Also, the CO 2 adsorption data support the results of the CO 2 reduction performance of the previous samples. In addition, the CO 2 adsorption on the surfaces of pure STO, Bi-Sr-STO, and Bi-Ti-STO was calculated to explore the influence of replacing different positions with Bi atom on CO 2 adsorption.Fig. 6c shows the charge difference distributions of CO 2 adsorption on the three samples.When CO 2 was adsorbed on the surface of the pure STO sample, electron accumulation areas were formed near O atom close to Sr atom in CO 2 molecules, whereas electron depletion areas were formed in other areas.These results demonstrate that CO 2 adsorption on the surface of pure STO induces the flow of electrons from other nearby atoms to O atoms of CO 2 molecules.This scenario is conducive to the activation and photocatalytic reaction of CO 2 molecules.For the Bi-Sr-STO samples, CO 2 adsorption on the sample surface induces the electron flow in a different direction from that of pure STO.Notably, the electron accumulation area formed between the two Bi atoms, whereas the other areas formed the electron depletion area.At the same time, electrons of nearby other atoms flow to the region between the two Bi atoms rather than CO 2 molecules, which is not conducive to subsequent activation of CO 2 molecules.This blocks the photocatalytic reaction.Regarding the Bi-Ti-STO sample, electron flow was almost identical to that of the pure STO sample following CO 2 adsorption on the sample surface.However, the flow of electrons from nearby atoms to O atoms of CO 2 molecules promotes further CO 2 activation.The above calculation results were completely in agreement with the experimental phenomena.These data also demonstrate that the Sr atom in STO is the active site for CO 2 adsorption, playings a significant role in CO 2 reduction.In view of band structure, Bi doping can reduce the band gap of SrTiO 3-x nanosheets, enhance light absorption and promote the separation of photogenerated carriers.In terms of CO 2 activation, the Sr site is the active site of SrTiO 3-x nanosheets.Replacing Sr atom with Bi atom weakened the adsorption and activation of CO 2 on the surface of the SrTiO 3-x nanosheet.This ultimately inhibited the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction.However, there was no adverse effect on the adsorption and activation of CO 2 when Bi atoms replaced Ti atoms.These data demonstratea need to consider band structure and CO 2 adsorption when improving photocatalytic CO 2 reduction efficiency. The conditions for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction and the C sources in the products are concerned.The photocatalytic reduc-tion of CO 2 was carried out in the dark, without the use of a catalyst, and with N 2 instead of CO 2 .As shown in Fig. S5a, no products were formed when 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples were used as a photocatalyst in the absence of light.Therefore, light irradiation is an essential prerequisite for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction.If the remainder of the reduction process is left constant, no catalyst is added, and no products are formed.This implies that photocatalyst is also requirement for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.When CO 2 is substituted for N 2 , no product is formed.It has been suggested that the source of C in the product is CO 2 .The stability of the photocatalyst is also a critical aspect in determining the performance of the photocatalyst.Fig. S5b shows four photocatalytic CO 2 reduction cycles using 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples.After four cycles, the photocatalyst still exhibited excellent photocatalytic CO 2 conversion performance.Fig. S6 illustrates the XRD patterns of a 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO sample before and after cycling.The structure of the 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO nanosheet remained unchanged before and after the photocatalytic reaction.Fig. S7 shows the SEM before and after cycling for a 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO sample.As seen in the figure, the microstructure of the 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO sample remained unchanged during the photocatalytic reaction.It retained the nanosheet morphology.These findings implied that the Bi atom that substituted for the Ti atom in SrTiO 3-x nanosheets was stable. The optoelectronic properties of photocatalysts were investigated to determine the effect of Bi doping on the generation, separation, and transportation of photogenerated electron-hole.The time-resolved PL decay curves and fitted parameters for pure STO, 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO, and 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples are shown in Fig. 7a and Table 1.s 1 is the non-radiative process, whereas s 2 is a radiative process.s denotes the average lifetime.The average lifetimes of pure STO, 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO, and 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples were 2.5705 ns, 2.9518 ns, and 2.9903 ns, respectively (Table 1).It was hypothesized that doping the Bi element effectively inhibits the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes.To further investigate the effect of Bi doping on the separation efficiency of photogenerated electrons and holes a surface photovoltage spectra were acquired.The SPV spectra of pure STO, 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO, and 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples are shown in Fig. 7b.In comparison to steady-state PL spectra, the higher the peak value of the sample, the greater the efficiency of photogenerated electron-hole separation.Three samples showed pronounced peaks at 320 nm.The peak value for samples containing 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples was the highest.The pure STO sample had the lowest peak value.It suggested that Bi doping restrained the composition of photogenerated electron-hole pairs.414243 The photocurrent of pure STO, 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO, and 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples are shown in Fig. S8a.Pure STO samples had the low- est photocurrent intensity.When Bi replaced Sr and Ti, the photocurrent intensity of 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO and 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples was significantly increased, while the photocurrent remained relatively stable.It demonstrated that regardless of whether Bi replaced Sr or Ti in SrTiO 3 , the generation and separation of photogenerated carriers were promoted.44,45 Nyquist impedance plots of pure STO, 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO, and 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples are shown in Fig. S8b.The radius of pure STO samples was the largest, while the radius of 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO and 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples were smaller than that of pure STO samples.This demonstrated that after doping the Bi element, the charge transfer resistance of the photocatalyst decreased and the transfer efficiency of the interface charge on the contact surface increased.46 Fig. S8c illustrates the steady-state PL spectra of the three samples.Three samples showed significant absorption peaks at 438 nm.The absorption peak of pure STO samples was the highest, indicating the highest photogenerated electron-hole pair composition rates.The absorption peaks of 1.0 Bi-Sr-STO and 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples were significantly reduced when Bi replaced Sr or Ti, demonstrating that doping Bi element could prevent recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes.47 All experimental findings demonstrated that doping with Bi significantly hindered photogenerated carriers' recombination and increased absorption of visible light.When Bi atom replaced Sr atom or Ti atom, the degree of hybridization between Bi, Ti, and O atoms in the valence band was very low.The migration of photogenerated electrons from the crystal to the surface is favorable.On the other hand, the oxygen vacancy concentration in the sample increased, and the oxygen vacancies acted as photogenerated electrons traps.It prevented the recombination of photogenerated carriers during the separation and migration of photogenerated electrons and holes.Therefore, the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance was improved. The path of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction has always been the focus.Therefore, the intermediates in the photocatalytic process of 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples were determined by in-situ FTIR spectroscopy.Fig. 8a shows the spectra of 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples after a 10 min dark reaction in a dark chamber.The following were the observed peaks: 1203 cm A1 , 1315 cm A1 , 1384 cm A1 , 1502 cm A1 , 1565 cm A1 and 1650 cm A1 .The peak at 1203 cm A1 was indexed to HCO 3 -and the peak intensity continued to increase.40 The peak at 1315 cm A1 was ascribed to CO 3 2-, 48 and the peak intensity increased gradually.The 1384 cm A1 peak was attributed to the CAO stretch in COOH, which is constantly enhanced and slightly shifted to the left.49 The peak at 1502 cm A1 was assigned to CO 3 2-, which gradually disappeared.50 The 1565 cm A1 peak was COO -, which gradually increased and gradually shifted to the left. 49 The 1650 cm A1 peak was associated with the HAOAH bend, which existed initially, but gradually disappeared.51 The spectra of 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples for CO 2 reduction after dark reaction are shown in Fig. 8b.The spectra obtained under light conditions dif- fered from those obtained under dark conditions, suggesting that the material on the surface of the photocatalyst changed in response to light.The peak at 1207 cm A1 corresponded to HCO 3 -, 40 while the peak at 1319 cm A1 was CO 3 2-, 48 and the peak value gradually increased.The peak value at 1608 cm A1 gradually shifted to 1564 cm A1 as the amount of light increased, indicating that the intermediate product gradually changed from HCO 3 -to COO -. 49,52 The peak at 1697 cm A1 was attributed to the CO stretch in COOH, and the peak gradually increased.53 According to the analysis of the above results, the intermediates of 1.0 Bi-Ti-STO samples in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction included HCO 3 -, CO 3 2-, COO -, and COOH.According to earlier experimental results, the primary product of this reaction was CO, with a minimal amount of CH 4 .The possible mechanism of STO photocatalytic CO 2 reduction is shown in scheme 2. Therefore, the following reaction steps were hypothesized: CO 2 was initially adsorbed on the surface of the photocatalyst, and the intermediate COO -was formed after receiving photogenerated electrons.Photocatalyst visible light e A h"}, {"llm generation": "Visible light", "source": "Due to the synergistic effect of Bi doping, oxygen vacancies, and the Sr active site, the composition of photogenerated electron-hole pairs was effectively inhibited and the absorption of visible light was enhanced in the samples.", "context": "In summary, the SrTiO 3-x nanosheet with oxygen vacancies is successfully synthesized.Ethylene glycol plays an important role in the formation of 2D morphology and oxygen vacancies.To further enhance the photocatalytic performance of the SrTiO 3-x nanosheet, X-Bi-Sr-STO and X-Bi-Ti-STO samples were successfully prepared by doping SrTiO 3-x with different amounts of Bi element.The Sr site is determined to be the CO 2 adsorption site.Due to the synergistic effect of Bi doping, oxygen vacancies, and the Sr active site, the composition of photogenerated electron-hole pairs was effectively inhibited and the absorption of visible light was enhanced in the samples.The performance of 1 Bi-Ti-STO samples was the greatest, with CO and CH 4 yields of 5.58 umol/g/h and 0.36 umol/g/h, respectively, which were 1.79 and 1.57 times that of SrTiO 3-x .COO -and COOH are important intermediates in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction.This study contributes significantly to the understanding of how to prepare SrTiO 3 catalysts with enhanced visible-light catalytic properties.
