ZnS/MMT.The second variation, the ratio of ZnS suspension volume to MMT weight was varied from 1:2 (L:g) to 1:4 and 1:8, resulting in nanocomposites denoted as 3.1 wt. ZnS/MMT and 2.0 wt. ZnS/MMT. The content of ZnS in ZnS/MMT nanocomposites was determined by elemental analysis of sulphur performed by a combustion analyser ELTRA (Eltra, Germany) and determination of zinc after their dissolution in a mixture of HF, HNO 3 and HClO 4 41 by an atomic absorption spectrometer AA280FS (Varian Inc., Austria). The nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurements at 77 K were performed using the volumetric apparatus Nova2000e (Quntachrome, USA).Prior to the nitrogen physisorption measurements, the samples were degassed at 105 C for 4 h under vacuum less than 1 Pa.Degassing at temperature of 105 C was applied in order to remove physisorbed water, however, with no influence on the textural or structural properties of investigated nanocomposites.The specific surface area, S BET , was calculated according to the classical Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) theory for the relative pressure range p/p 0 0.05-0.3042.Since the specific surface area, S BET , is not such a proper parameter in the case of mesoporous solids containing some micropores 42,43, the mesopore surface area, S meso , and the micropore volume, V micro , were additionally also evaluated based on the t-plot method 44, using DeBoer standard isotherm.The net pore volume, V net , was determined from the nitrogen adsorption isotherm at maximum p/p 0 (0.991).The mesoporesize distribution (pore diameter 3-130 nm) was evaluated from the adsorption branch of the nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm by the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method 45, using the DeBoer standard isotherm and the assumption of the cylindrical pore geometry. The X-ray diffraction powder (XRD) patterns were measured by a standard laboratory diffractometer in the conventional focusing Bragg-Brentano geometry with variable slits (Ni-filtered Cu K, 1.4 kW).A linear detector was used to collect the scattered intensity. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations were carried out on a JEOL 2010F microscope operated at 200 kV (LaB6 cathode, resolution 0.19 nm) using carbon coated copper grid. UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of prepared samples (grain size 0.160 mm) were measured by using a GBS CINTRA 303 spectrometer equipped with a Spectralon-coated integrating sphere using a Spectralon coated discs as a standard.The spectra were recorded in the range of the wavelength 200-800 nm (lamps switched at 350 nm).The reflectances were re-calculated to the absorption using the Schuster-Kubelka-Munk equation, where R is the diffuse reflectance from a semi-infinite layer.The obtained spectra were transformed to the dependencies (F(R )h ) 2 against h and assuming that the Tauc's law 46,47 can be expressed as: , where the Eg is the energy of absorption edge values (determined from obtained plots), h is the Planck constant and is the light frequency.Kubelka-Munk function was used to estimate the band gap energy of prepared photocatalysts.The optical absorption threshold (lg) was calculated using the equation, lg 1240/EB, where EB is the band gap energy. The contact potential difference (V CPD ) measurements were carried out by the dynamic condenser method of Kelvin with a KP6500 probe (McAllister Technical Services).The reference electrode was a standard stainless steel plate with diameter of 3 mm ( r ef 4.3 eV) provided by the manufacturer.During the measurements the gradient of the peak-to-peak versus backing potential was set to 0.2, whereas the vibration frequency and amplitude was set to 120 Hz and 40 a.u.The final V CPD value was an average of 60 independent points using two backing potentials.The measurements were carried out under atmospheric pressure and ambient temperature.Before measurements the samples were pressed into pellets of 10 mm diameter using the 8 MPa pressure.The work function values were obtained from a simple relation V CPD ref - sample . The photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide was carried out in a stirred batch annular reactor with a suspended catalyst illuminated by the UV 8 W Hg-lamp (254 nm).The CO 2 diffusion from the gas phase through the gas-liquid interface in a laboratory batch slurry reactor was eliminated by saturating the aqueous solutions of 0.2 mmol/L NaOH with pure CO 2 before the beginning of reactions.During this step, pH decreased from 11.8 to 6.6.The catalyst loading of 1 g/L was chosen to avoid the concentration gradients in a bulk of stirred liquid with the dispersion due to a scattering effect of light as a result of the high nanocomposite concentration.A suitable volume of 100 mL of the liquid phase was used to ensure the perfect mixing in this photoreactor 48.CO 2 reduction products, such as hydrogen, methane and carbon monoxide, were analysed by a gas chromatograph (GC-Agilent Technologies 6890N) equipped with FID and TCD detectors (GC/FID/TCD) and the Molsieve and HP Poraplot Q columns.The calibration with certified calibration gases (0.05 mol.CH 4 , 0.987 mol.H 2 , 2.02 mol.CO, and 99.999 mol.CO 2 ) was performed before each experimental run. Concerning the chemical composition of nanocomposites, the elemental analysis and atomic absorption spectroscopy confirmed that investigated ZnS/MMT nanocomposites contained 4.2 wt., 3.1 wt. and 2.0 wt. of ZnS.In frame of these analyses some content of carbon in individual nanocomposites was also determined as follows: 25.0 wt., 19.4 wt. and 12.0 wt..The source of carbon was the stabilizing cationic surfactant CTAB. With respect to potential application of developed ZnS/MMT nanocomposites in liquid systems, their stability was explored in our previous works 49,50, via their shaking in water for 24 h.The dispersions were filtered and the UV-vis absorption spectra of filtrates were recorded.There was not detected any typical absorption edge of ZnS nanoparticles at about 320 nm in absorption spectra which means that the ZnS nanoparticles were firmly attached to MMT likely located in its pores 49.The stability of ZnS/MMT nanocomposites was also confirmed by the derived mathematical model 50. Fig. 1a and b shows measured nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms and evaluated pore-size distributions of investigated ZnS/MMT nanocomposites.Textural properties are summarized in Table 1.The shapes of nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms of all ZnS/MMT nanocomposites correspond to porous materials possessing dominantly larger mesopores/macropores.In addition to that, it is evident from Fig. 1a that pristine MMT possesses besides large mesopores/macropores also a small portion of micropores (pores with diameter 2 nm, V micro 2 mm 3 liq /g).According to previous research 51, the missing smallest pores in all ZnS/MMT nanocomposites and decreasing nanocomposite specific surface area can be attributed to a plugging of some part of the MMT porous structure, evidently of micropores and smaller mesopores, by CTAB which was used for ZnS/MMT nanocomposites synthesis and whose presence was proved by the determined carbon content by using AAS and elemental analysis.It was reported that the specific surface area of MMT can diminish due to the plugging of MMT porous structure by CTAB up to 4.4 m 2 /g 51.This indicates that further strongly decreased specific surface area of the 4.2 wt. ZnS/MMT nanocomposite (0.9 m 2 /g) may be a result of the secondary effect-incorporation of ZnS nanoparticles and/or ZnS agglomerates to MMT meso-macroporous structure.This phenomenon corresponds to Fig. 1b where pores with diameter 13 nm are evidently disappearing with increasing loading of ZnS nanoparticles from 3.1 to 4.2 wt.. The XRD measurements were performed in order to reveal the crystal structure of ZnS nanoparticles and to determine the inter-planar distance of 0 0 1 planes (d 001 ) of MMT.The diffraction patterns for all the samples including pristine MMT are displayed in Fig. 2a.While the presence of crystalline quartz (trigonal SiO 2 , space group P3 2 21) can be clearly seen, ZnS in any common crystalline form (sphalerite-cubic, F4; -3m; wurtzite-hexagonal, P6 3 mc) cannot be proved.This observation might be caused either by very small ZnS crystallite size or due to small amounts of ZnS nanoparticles (2-4.2 wt.) in the ZnS/MMT nanocomposites since possible ZnS peaks may coincide with those coming from MMT or quartz. The diffraction maxima corresponding to d 001 planes in MMT are displayed in detail in Fig. 2b for all the samples.A shift of the 0 0 1 diffraction peaks corresponding to an increase of the inter-planar distance d 001 with increasing concentration of ZnS can be observed (Table 2).This effect can be explained by the presence of some carbon amounts (12-25 wt.) in all the ZnS/MMT nanocomposites, which come from CTAB used during the deposition of ZnS nanoparticles and is intercalated in the MMT interlayer and thus increases the d 001 distance of MMT.This feature also pretty correlates with the decreasing specific surface area of investigated nanocomposites in the order 2.0 wt. ZnS/MMT 3.1 wt. ZnS/MMT 4.2 wt. ZnS/MMT as a consequence of increasing carbon amounts 12, 19.4 and 25 wt., respectively.However, from Table 2 and Fig. 3 is evident that the change in the inter-planar distance d 001 of MMT at 3.1 wt. and 4.2 wt. ZnS loadings is not so substantial despite the significantly increased carbon amount (19.4 and 25 wt., respectively).It reveals that at 4.2 wt. of deposited ZnS the effect of CTAB intercalation to the MMT interlayer is comparable to that for 3.1 wt. of ZnS and thus the significantly decreased specific surface area of 4.2 wt. ZnS/MMT nanocomposite (0.9 m 2 /g) can be caused by plugging of MMT mesopores and macropores by additional CTAB as well as ZnS nanoparticles or their agglomerates, e.g. in the pore mouths.The observations from XRD pretty support the observations from nitrogen physisorption. The position of the 0 0 1 diffraction peak in MMT and corresponding inter-planar distances d001 with estimated errors.Arising from previous knowledge about possible agglomeration of ZnS nanoparticles stabilized by CTAB 52 and in order to support hypotheses about plugging of MMT porous structure also by ZnS nanoparticles/agglomerates, the TEM analysis of ZnS/MMT nanocomposites was performed as well.The TEM micrographs showing ZnS agglomerates of different sizes deposited on the external surface of MMT are shown in Fig. 4a andb.A detailed view of one ZnS agglomerate revealed that the agglomerates were composed of individual ZnS nanoparticles with sizes of about 20-40 nm.It is in contrast with determined gap energies (see below) corresponding to sizes equal and smaller than 10 nm when the quantum size effect occurs.This apparent disagreement indicates that ZnS nanoparticles of different sizes as well as agglomerated in large agglomerates with sizes of several hundred nanometers exist on MMT.Formation of agglomerates is key for understanding different photocatalytic efficiency discussed below. Since the same ZnS suspension was used for the preparation of all ZnS/MMT nanocomposites, the size of ZnS nanoparticles does not determine the differences between them.As reported in our previous study 28, ZnS nanoparticles and CTAB form agglomerates attached. The mean size of ZnS nanoparticles was estimated from their optical properties in a suspension, i.e. before they were deposited on MMT.The well described size-dependence of absorption spectra was considered and the effective mass approximation was utilized to obtain the size of ZnS nanoparticles from the following Brus equation 53: where E bg (bulk) and E bg (nano) are the band bap energies of bulk and nano-sized semiconductors, respectively, h is the Planck' constant, m e and m h are the effective masses of electron and hole, respectively, and is the dielectric constant of the material.Here, m e 0.42 m 0 and m h 0.61 m 0 , where m 0 is the free electron mass and the dielectric constant e 8.76 54.The band gap energy of ZnS nanoparticles was estimated from the linear part of the (h ) 0.5 versus (h ) plot as described in our previous work 28.Fig. 5 shows the UV-vis spectra of ZnS/MMT nanocomposites.The band gap energy of ZnS/MMT with 2.0 wt. of ZnS was 3.65 eV (Table 1).This value is close to that band gap energy reported for bulk ZnS (3.6-3.7 eV) 55.The band gap energy of ZnS/MMT increased with increasing concentration of ZnS up to 3.84 eV for 4.2 wt. ZnS/MMT.Previously, it has been reported that the increase in band gap energy is a result of reduction in the particle size of ZnS that is related to the quantum confinement effects 565758 a vacuum, is the dielectric constant for the ZnS (8.76), h is the Planck constant and e is the charge of an electron.Diameter (2R) of studied materials has been estimated to be 10.0 nm, 7.2 nm and 5.7 nm for ZnS/MMT with 2.0 wt., 3.1 wt. and 4.2 wt. of ZnS.The absolute values of ZnS particles calculated from UV-vis are affected by used E 0 value that has been reported to be 3.6-3.7 eV and the dielectric constant for the ZnS.This is probably a reason, why the absolute value of ZnS particles calculated from UV-vis is lower than those values determined from TEM.Nevertheless, it brings attractive connection between TEM and UV-vis results.It is surprising that the particle diameter of ZnS calculated from the band gap energy (Table 1) decreases with increasing ZnS loading.Moreover, it is in contrast to TEM results.This effect can be explained by clustering of ZnS particles with approximately of the same nano-size.While 2.0 wt. ZnS/MMT contains separated ZnS nanoparticles with approximately the same diameter of 20-40 nm (TEM-Fig.4a), 4.2 wt. ZnS/MMT contains both ZnS nanoparticles and ZnS agglomerates of micrometer-size composed of many of ZnS nanoparticles (TEM-Fig.4b).Based on that fact the decrease in the band gap energy can be associated with the dominant effect of the presence of higher amount of ZnS nanoparticles and lower amount of ZnS agglomerates. ZnS/MMT nanocomposites with different contents of ZnS were investigated for the photoreduction of CO 2 dissolved in NaOH solutions.The commercial TiO 2 Evonic P25 photocatalyst was examined as a reference for comparison.The effect of irradiation time on the formation of products was investigated over a period of 0-24 h.Fig. 6 shows the evolution of all reaction products as the functions of the irradiation for the 3.1 wt. ZnS/MMT nanocomposite.The main gaseous product was methane.Hydrogen and low amounts of carbon monoxide were also detected.Other products such as formic acid, formaldehyde, ethane and ethylene could also be formed 22,59, but they were undetectable in our GC configuration.The observed yields (mol/g cat ) order was: H 2 CH 4 CO. Comparisons of CH 4 , H 2 and CO yields over ZnS/MMT with different contents of ZnS are shown in Fig. 7a-c, respectively.A gradual increase of methane yield was observed after the start of irradiation with the exception of commercial TiO 2 catalyst.In this case the yields of methane were negligible during the first 8 h of irradiation.The highest yield of methane was observed for 3.1 wt. ZnS/MMT. In case of ZnS/MMT, the hydrogen yields continually increased during the whole experiments.In comparison with the application of commercial titanium dioxide, hydrogen was produced in 6-fold higher concentrations (Fig. 7b).The yields of carbon monoxide were increasing slowly during the reaction, but all yields were close to the limit of detection (Fig. 7c).The highest yield of both products was observed for 3.1 wt. ZnS/MMT. The data from the longest reaction time span were chosen for the overall comparison because the yields of all products were the highest and the most accurate.The results show that the photocatalytic performance of nanocomposites varies with the content of ZnS in the order of 3.1 wt. ZnS 4.2 wt. ZnS 2.0 wt. ZnS.All yields of products for ZnS/MMT nanocomposites were higher than those for the commercial photocatalyst Evonic P25.According to the blank test, the original montmorillonite does not possess any photocatalytic performance. Regarding the possible formation of reaction products in a consequence of some carbon content from CTAB presented, it is worth to mention that the formation of methane was already investigated with the developed type of nanocomposite within the blank experiments at various pH in our previous study 60.The generation of methane was observed, the effect of different pH on the methane yields was comparable.However, in our study the evolution of photocatalytic performance of ZnS/MMT nanocomposites does not follow the trend in increasing carbon content (within increasing ZnS loading), thus the determined trend in photocatalytic performance can be considered as not burdened with this fact and correct. One would assume that with increasing loading of ZnS nanoparticles, which is the only active component in the ZnS/MMT nanocomposites, the photocatalytic performance of investigated nanocomposites would escalate.However, this hypothesis was not confirmed.According to the blank test, the original montmorillonite does not possess any photocatalytic performance.Besides that, 4.2 wt. of ZnS on MMT does not assign the highest photocatalytic performance.The overall order of photocatalytic performance in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 was following: 3.1 wt. ZnS 4.2 wt. ZnS 2.0 wt. ZnS.It is evident that with higher content of ZnS the nanocomposite photocatalytic performance in the first instance increases, but then there is a decline.This indicates that probably besides the ZnS loading, also the degree of agglomeration of ZnS nanoparticles plays a key role.The agglomeration of ZnS nanoparticles increases with increasing ZnS loading as it is evident from the results of TEM and UV-vis and it could be correlated with the work function as follows.The work function is the minimum energy that must be given to an electron to liberate it from the surface of ZnS nanoparticle.If ZnS occurs on MMT as same-size nanoparticles in various ZnS loadings, the work function should be same.We suppose, if such ZnS nanoparticles agglomerate and the degree of their agglomeration is too high, the work function should be higher.In our case with increasing ZnS loading the nanoparticles agglomerate and the lowest work function is achieved for 3.1 wt. of ZnS in MMT, when ZnS is partially as separated nanoparticles and partially as agglomerates.This evidences the correlation between the degree of ZnS nanoparticles agglomeration and the work function.Fig. 8 shows the correlation between the yields of methane after 24 h of irradiation and the work function of each catalyst.It can be seen from Fig. 8 that the lowest electron work function corresponds to the most active catalyst.This observation is in agreement with our previous observations over cerium doped TiO 2 nanoparticulated photocatalysts in the same reaction 61 and corresponds to the reaction mechanism.The photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide is conducted via generated electrons and the 3.1 wt. ZnS/MMT nanocomposite releases those electrons most easily.Contrary to that, pristine montmorillonite shows no photocatalytic performance, corresponding nicely to very high electron work function. The valence band of sulfide semiconductors, made of 3p orbitals of the sulfur atoms, is shifted upwards compared with those of the oxide analogues, while the conduction band electrons are also more reductive 62.For the CO 2 photocatalytic reduction the electron energy in conduction band must be higher than H reduction potential and the hole energy in valence band must be lower than OH -oxidation potentials.ZnS is a direct wide band gap semiconductor (Eg 3.6 eV in the bulk) 63, hence it absorbs only in the UV range, but it possesses a strongly reducing conduction band (E CB -1.85V versus the NHE at pH 7) 64.The addition of ZnS to MMT should result in changing the band gap and the absorption edge energies can be expected and was also experimentally demonstrated (see Fig. 5).However, it is always difficult to predict separately the shift of conduction and valence band energies, which are extremely important with respect to required oxidation and reduction potentials. The work function for different ZnS contents shown in Fig. 8 can help us to elucidate the shifts of conduction as well as valence bands.For simplicity the Fermi level on nanoparticle surface is supposed to be pinned to the middle of the nanoparticle band gap.Deriving from Figs. 5 and8 and Table 1, we can estimate that the energy of electrons on the conduction band edge is -2.066 eV, while the valence band edge is -5.716 eV for 2.0 wt. ZnS/MMT (Fig. 9a).For 3.1 wt. ZnS/MMT the energy of electrons on the conduction band edge increases about approximately 134 meV, while the valence band edge shifts up by 54 meV.Further increase of ZnS content up to 4.2 wt. led only to a much smaller conduction band decrease (21 meV), whereas the valence band edge shifts down by 89 meV.These shifts are depicted in Fig. 9b.Higher levels of the conduction band are more effective for the creation of H ions which are necessary for CO 2 reduction.It can be concluded that for 3.1 wt. of ZnS the carriers have the most suitable potentials for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 . In summary: Since the optical and electronic properties of nanocomposites have been considered as key properties related to the mechanism of CO 2 photocatalytic reduction and there exist the correlation between the band gap energy, the nanoparticle work function and the degree of agglomeration of nanoparticles, the behavior of ZnS on nano-size level plays the determining role.The shift in conduction band and valence band energies of ZnS at different ZnS loadings is a consequence of different degree of ZnS nanoparticles agglomeration on MMT. ZnS nanoparticles stabilized by cetyltrimethylammonium bromide were deposited on montmorillonite (MMT) forming the ZnS/MMT nanocomposites with ZnS loadings within 2.0-4.2wt..The key role in the performance of ZnS/MMT nanocomposites in the CO 2 photocatalytic reduction played the energies of electrons and holes within the electronic structure of designed photocatalytic materials, which were in fact affected by ZnS loadings.The potentials of electrons and holes required for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 were the most suitable for the 3.1 wt. ZnS/MMT nanocomposite.All prepared ZnS/MMT nanocomposites exhibited higher efficiency in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction in comparison with the commercial TiO 2 Evonic P25.

Fig. 1a and b shows measured nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms and evaluated pore-size distributions of investigated ZnS/MMT nanocomposites.Textural properties are summarized in Table 1.The shapes of nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms of all ZnS/MMT nanocomposites correspond to porous materials possessing dominantly larger mesopores/macropores.In addition to that, it is evident from Fig. 1a that pristine MMT possesses besides large mesopores/macropores also a small portion of micropores (pores with diameter 2 nm, V micro 2 mm 3 liq /g).According to previous research 51, the missing smallest pores in all ZnS/MMT nanocomposites and decreasing nanocomposite specific surface area can be attributed to a plugging of some part of the MMT porous structure, evidently of micropores and smaller mesopores, by CTAB which was used for ZnS/MMT nanocomposites synthesis and whose presence was proved by the determined carbon content by using AAS and elemental analysis.It was reported that the specific surface area of MMT can diminish due to the plugging of MMT porous structure by CTAB up to 4.4 m 2 /g 51.This indicates that further strongly decreased specific surface area of the 4.2 wt. ZnS/MMT nanocomposite (0.9 m 2 /g) may be a result of the secondary effect-incorporation of ZnS nanoparticles and/or ZnS agglomerates to MMT meso-macroporous structure.This phenomenon corresponds to Fig. 1b where pores with diameter 13 nm are evidently disappearing with increasing loading of ZnS nanoparticles from 3.1 to 4.2 wt.. The XRD measurements were performed in order to reveal the crystal structure of ZnS nanoparticles and to determine the inter-planar distance of 0 0 1 planes (d 001 ) of MMT.The diffraction patterns for all the samples including pristine MMT are displayed in Fig. 2a.While the presence of crystalline quartz (trigonal SiO 2 , space group P3 2 21) can be clearly seen, ZnS in any common crystalline form (sphalerite-cubic, F4; -3m; wurtzite-hexagonal, P6 3 mc) cannot be proved.This observation might be caused either by very small ZnS crystallite size or due to small amounts of ZnS nanoparticles (2-4.2 wt.) in the ZnS/MMT nanocomposites since possible ZnS peaks may coincide with those coming from MMT or quartz. The diffraction maxima corresponding to d 001 planes in MMT are displayed in detail in Fig. 2b for all the samples.A shift of the 0 0 1 diffraction peaks corresponding to an increase of the inter-planar distance d 001 with increasing concentration of ZnS can be observed (Table 2).This effect can be explained by the presence of some carbon amounts (12-25 wt.) in all the ZnS/MMT nanocomposites, which come from CTAB used during the deposition of ZnS nanoparticles and is intercalated in the MMT interlayer and thus increases the d 001 distance of MMT.This feature also pretty correlates with the decreasing specific surface area of investigated nanocomposites in the order 2.0 wt.

ZnS/MMT as a consequence of increasing carbon amounts 12, 19.4 and 25 wt., respectively.However, from Table 2 and Fig. 3 is evident that the change in the inter-planar distance d 001 of MMT at 3.1 wt. and 4.2 wt. ZnS loadings is not so substantial despite the significantly increased carbon amount (19.4 and 25 wt., respectively).It reveals that at 4.2 wt. of deposited ZnS the effect of CTAB intercalation to the MMT interlayer is comparable to that for 3.1 wt. of ZnS and thus the significantly decreased specific surface area of 4.2 wt. ZnS/MMT nanocomposite (0.9 m 2 /g) can be caused by plugging of MMT mesopores and macropores by additional CTAB as well as ZnS nanoparticles or their agglomerates, e.g. in the pore mouths.The observations from XRD pretty support the observations from nitrogen physisorption. The position of the 0 0 1 diffraction peak in MMT and corresponding inter-planar distances d001 with estimated errors.Arising from previous knowledge about possible agglomeration of ZnS nanoparticles stabilized by CTAB 52 and in order to support hypotheses about plugging of MMT porous structure also by ZnS nanoparticles/agglomerates, the TEM analysis of ZnS/MMT nanocomposites was performed as well.The TEM micrographs showing ZnS agglomerates of different sizes deposited on the external surface of MMT are shown in Fig. 4a andb.A detailed view of one ZnS agglomerate revealed that the agglomerates were composed of individual ZnS nanoparticles with sizes of about 20-40 nm.It is in contrast with determined gap energies (see below) corresponding to sizes equal and smaller than 10 nm when the quantum size effect occurs.This apparent disagreement indicates that ZnS nanoparticles of different sizes as well as agglomerated in large agglomerates with sizes of several hundred nanometers exist on MMT.Formation of agglomerates is key for understanding different photocatalytic efficiency discussed below. Since the same ZnS suspension was used for the preparation of all ZnS/MMT nanocomposites, the size of ZnS nanoparticles does not determine the differences between them.As reported in our previous study 28, ZnS nanoparticles and CTAB form agglomerates attached. The mean size of ZnS nanoparticles was estimated from their optical properties in a suspension, i.e. before they were deposited on MMT.The well described size-dependence of absorption spectra was considered and the effective mass approximation was utilized to obtain the size of ZnS nanoparticles from the following Brus equation 53: where E bg (bulk) and E bg (nano) are the band bap energies of bulk and nano-sized semiconductors, respectively, h is the Planck' constant, m e and m h are the effective masses of electron and hole, respectively, and is the dielectric constant of the material.Here, m e 0.42 m 0 and m h 0.61 m 0 , where m 0 is the free electron mass and the dielectric constant e 8.76 54.The band gap energy of ZnS nanoparticles was estimated from the linear part of the (h ) 0.5 versus (h ) plot as described in our previous work 28.Fig. 5 shows the UV-vis spectra of ZnS/MMT nanocomposites.The band gap energy of ZnS/MMT with 2.0 wt. of ZnS was 3.65 eV (Table 1).This value is close to that band gap energy reported for bulk ZnS (3.6-3.7 eV) 55.The band gap energy of ZnS/MMT increased with increasing concentration of ZnS up to 3.84 eV for 4.2 wt. ZnS/MMT.Previously, it has been reported that the increase in band gap energy is a result of reduction in the particle size of ZnS that is related to the quantum confinement effects 565758 a vacuum, is the dielectric constant for the ZnS (8.76), h is the Planck constant and e is the charge of an electron.Diameter (2R) of studied materials has been estimated to be 10.0 nm, 7.2 nm and 5.7 nm for ZnS/MMT with 2.0 wt., 3.1 wt. and 4.2 wt. of ZnS.The absolute values of ZnS particles calculated from UV-vis are affected by used E 0 value that has been reported to be 3.6-3.7 eV and the dielectric constant for the ZnS.This is probably a reason, why the absolute value of ZnS particles calculated from UV-vis is lower than those values determined from TEM.Nevertheless, it brings attractive connection between TEM and UV-vis results.It is surprising that the particle diameter of ZnS calculated from the band gap energy (Table 1) decreases with increasing ZnS loading.Moreover, it is in contrast to TEM results.This effect can be explained by clustering of ZnS particles with approximately of the same nano-size.While 2.0 wt. ZnS/MMT contains separated ZnS nanoparticles with approximately the same diameter of 20-40 nm (TEM-Fig.4a), 4.2 wt. ZnS/MMT contains both ZnS nanoparticles and ZnS agglomerates of micrometer-size composed of many of ZnS nanoparticles (TEM-Fig.4b).Based on that fact the decrease in the band gap energy can be associated with the dominant effect of the presence of higher amount of ZnS nanoparticles and lower amount of ZnS agglomerates. ZnS/MMT nanocomposites with different contents of ZnS were investigated for the photoreduction of CO 2 dissolved in NaOH solutions.The commercial TiO 2 Evonic P25 photocatalyst was examined as a reference for comparison.The effect of irradiation time on the formation of products was investigated over a period of 0-24 h.Fig. 6 shows the evolution of all reaction products as the functions of the irradiation for the 3.1 wt. ZnS/MMT nanocomposite.The main gaseous product was methane.Hydrogen and low amounts of carbon monoxide were also detected.Other products such as formic acid, formaldehyde, ethane and ethylene could also be formed 22,59, but they were undetectable in our GC configuration.The observed yields (mol/g cat ) order was: H 2 CH 4 CO. Comparisons of CH 4 , H 2 and CO yields over ZnS/MMT with different contents of ZnS are shown in Fig. 7a-c, respectively.A gradual increase of methane yield was observed after the start of irradiation with the exception of commercial TiO 2 catalyst.In this case the yields of methane were negligible during the first 8 h of irradiation.The highest yield of methane was observed for 3.1 wt. ZnS/MMT. In case of ZnS/MMT, the hydrogen yields continually increased during the whole experiments.In comparison with the application of commercial titanium dioxide, hydrogen was produced in 6-fold higher concentrations (Fig. 7b).The yields of carbon monoxide were increasing slowly during the reaction, but all yields were close to the limit of detection (Fig. 7c).The highest yield of both products was observed for 3.1 wt. ZnS/MMT. The data from the longest reaction time span were chosen for the overall comparison because the yields of all products were the highest and the most accurate.The results show that the photocatalytic performance of nanocomposites varies with the content of ZnS in the order of 3.1 wt. ZnS 4.2 wt. ZnS 2.0 wt. ZnS.All yields of products for ZnS/MMT nanocomposites were higher than those for the commercial photocatalyst Evonic P25.According to the blank test, the original montmorillonite does not possess any photocatalytic performance. Regarding the possible formation of reaction products in a consequence of some carbon content from CTAB presented, it is worth to mention that the formation of methane was already investigated with the developed type of nanocomposite within the blank experiments at various pH in our previous study 60.The generation of methane was observed, the effect of different pH on the methane yields was comparable.However, in our study the evolution of photocatalytic performance of ZnS/MMT nanocomposites does not follow the trend in increasing carbon content (within increasing ZnS loading), thus the determined trend in photocatalytic performance can be considered as not burdened with this fact and correct. One would assume that with increasing loading of ZnS nanoparticles, which is the only active component in the ZnS/MMT nanocomposites, the photocatalytic performance of investigated nanocomposites would escalate.However, this hypothesis was not confirmed.According to the blank test, the original montmorillonite does not possess any photocatalytic performance.Besides that, 4.2 wt. of ZnS on MMT does not assign the highest photocatalytic performance.The overall order of photocatalytic performance in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 was following: 3.1 wt. ZnS 4.2 wt. ZnS 2.0 wt. ZnS.It is evident that with higher content of ZnS the nanocomposite photocatalytic performance in the first instance increases, but then there is a decline.This indicates that probably besides the ZnS loading, also the degree of agglomeration of ZnS nanoparticles plays a key role.The agglomeration of ZnS nanoparticles increases with increasing ZnS loading as it is evident from the results of TEM and UV-vis and it could be correlated with the work function as follows.The work function is the minimum energy that must be given to an electron to liberate it from the surface of ZnS nanoparticle.If ZnS occurs on MMT as same-size nanoparticles in various ZnS loadings, the work function should be same.We suppose, if such ZnS nanoparticles agglomerate and the degree of their agglomeration is too high, the work function should be higher.In our case with increasing ZnS loading the nanoparticles agglomerate and the lowest work function is achieved for 3.1 wt. of ZnS in MMT, when ZnS is partially as separated nanoparticles and partially as agglomerates.This evidences the correlation between the degree of ZnS nanoparticles agglomeration and the work function.Fig. 8 shows the correlation between the yields of methane after 24 h of irradiation and the work function of each catalyst.It can be seen from Fig. 8 that the lowest electron work function corresponds to the most active catalyst.This observation is in agreement with our previous observations over cerium doped TiO 2 nanoparticulated photocatalysts in the same reaction 61 and corresponds to the reaction mechanism.The photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide is conducted via generated electrons and the 3.1 wt. ZnS/MMT nanocomposite releases those electrons most easily.Contrary to that, pristine montmorillonite shows no photocatalytic performance, corresponding nicely to very high electron work function. The valence band of sulfide semiconductors, made of 3p orbitals of the sulfur atoms, is shifted upwards compared with those of the oxide analogues, while the conduction band electrons are also more reductive 62.For the CO 2 photocatalytic reduction the electron energy in conduction band must be higher than H reduction potential and the hole energy in valence band must be lower than OH -oxidation potentials.ZnS is a direct wide band gap semiconductor (Eg 3.6 eV in the bulk) 63, hence it absorbs only in the UV range, but it possesses a strongly reducing conduction band (E CB -1.85V versus the NHE at pH 7) 64.The addition of ZnS to MMT should result in changing the band gap and the absorption edge energies can be expected and was also experimentally demonstrated (see Fig. 5).However, it is always difficult to predict separately the shift of conduction and valence band energies, which are extremely important with respect to required oxidation and reduction potentials. The work function for different ZnS contents shown in Fig. 8 can help us to elucidate the shifts of conduction as well as valence bands.For simplicity the Fermi level on nanoparticle surface is supposed to be pinned to the middle of the nanoparticle band gap.Deriving from Figs. 5 and8 and Table 1, we can estimate that the energy of electrons on the conduction band edge is -2.066 eV, while the valence band edge is -5.716 eV for 2.0 wt. ZnS/MMT (Fig. 9a).For 3.1 wt. ZnS/MMT the energy of electrons on the conduction band edge increases about approximately 134 meV, while the valence band edge shifts up by 54 meV.Further increase of ZnS content up to 4.2 wt. led only to a much smaller conduction band decrease (21 meV), whereas the valence band edge shifts down by 89 meV.These shifts are depicted in Fig. 9b.Higher levels of the conduction band are more effective for the creation of H ions which are necessary for CO 2 reduction.It can be concluded that for 3.1 wt. of ZnS the carriers have the most suitable potentials for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 . In summary: Since the optical and electronic properties of nanocomposites have been considered as key properties related to the mechanism of CO 2 photocatalytic reduction and there exist the correlation between the band gap energy, the nanoparticle work function and the degree of agglomeration of nanoparticles, the behavior of ZnS on nano-size level plays the determining role.The shift in conduction band and valence band energies of ZnS at different ZnS loadings is a consequence of different degree of ZnS nanoparticles agglomeration on MMT."}, {"llm generation": "TiO2 Evonic P25", "source": "The commercial TiO 2 Evonic P25 photocatalyst was examined as a reference for comparison.", "context": "Concerning the chemical composition of nanocomposites, the elemental analysis and atomic absorption spectroscopy confirmed that investigated ZnS/MMT nanocomposites contained 4.2 wt., 3.1 wt. and 2.0 wt. of ZnS.In frame of these analyses some content of carbon in individual nanocomposites was also determined as follows: 25.0 wt., 19.4 wt. and 12.0 wt..The source of carbon was the stabilizing cationic surfactant CTAB. With respect to potential application of developed ZnS/MMT nanocomposites in liquid systems, their stability was explored in our previous works 49,50, via their shaking in water for 24 h.The dispersions were filtered and the UV-vis absorption spectra of filtrates were recorded.There was not detected any typical absorption edge of ZnS nanoparticles at about 320 nm in absorption spectra which means that the ZnS nanoparticles were firmly attached to MMT likely located in its pores 49.The stability of ZnS/MMT nanocomposites was also confirmed by the derived mathematical model 50. Fig. 1a and b shows measured nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms and evaluated pore-size distributions of investigated ZnS/MMT nanocomposites.Textural properties are summarized in Table 1.The shapes of nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms of all ZnS/MMT nanocomposites correspond to porous materials possessing dominantly larger mesopores/macropores.In addition to that, it is evident from Fig. 1a that pristine MMT possesses besides large mesopores/macropores also a small portion of micropores (pores with diameter 2 nm, V micro 2 mm 3 liq /g).According to previous research 51, the missing smallest pores in all ZnS/MMT nanocomposites and decreasing nanocomposite specific surface area can be attributed to a plugging of some part of the MMT porous structure, evidently of micropores and smaller mesopores, by CTAB which was used for ZnS/MMT nanocomposites synthesis and whose presence was proved by the determined carbon content by using AAS and elemental analysis.It was reported that the specific surface area of MMT can diminish due to the plugging of MMT porous structure by CTAB up to 4.4 m 2 /g 51.This indicates that further strongly decreased specific surface area of the 4.2 wt. ZnS/MMT nanocomposite (0.9 m 2 /g) may be a result of the secondary effect-incorporation of ZnS nanoparticles and/or ZnS agglomerates to MMT meso-macroporous structure.This phenomenon corresponds to Fig. 1b where pores with diameter 13 nm are evidently disappearing with increasing loading of ZnS nanoparticles from 3.1 to 4.2 wt.. The XRD measurements were performed in order to reveal the crystal structure of ZnS nanoparticles and to determine the inter-planar distance of 0 0 1 planes (d 001 ) of MMT.The diffraction patterns for all the samples including pristine MMT are displayed in Fig. 2a.While the presence of crystalline quartz (trigonal SiO 2 , space group P3 2 21) can be clearly seen, ZnS in any common crystalline form (sphalerite-cubic, F4; -3m; wurtzite-hexagonal, P6 3 mc) cannot be proved.This observation might be caused either by very small ZnS crystallite size or due to small amounts of ZnS nanoparticles (2-4.2 wt.) in the ZnS/MMT nanocomposites since possible ZnS peaks may coincide with those coming from MMT or quartz. The diffraction maxima corresponding to d 001 planes in MMT are displayed in detail in Fig. 2b for all the samples.A shift of the 0 0 1 diffraction peaks corresponding to an increase of the inter-planar distance d 001 with increasing concentration of ZnS can be observed (Table 2).This effect can be explained by the presence of some carbon amounts (12-25 wt.) in all the ZnS/MMT nanocomposites, which come from CTAB used during the deposition of ZnS nanoparticles and is intercalated in the MMT interlayer and thus increases the d 001 distance of MMT.This feature also pretty correlates with the decreasing specific surface area of investigated nanocomposites in the order 2.0 wt. ZnS/MMT 3.1 wt. ZnS/MMT 4.2 wt. ZnS/MMT as a consequence of increasing carbon amounts 12, 19.4 and 25 wt., respectively.However, from Table 2 and Fig. 3 is evident that the change in the inter-planar distance d 001 of MMT at 3.1 wt. and 4.2 wt. ZnS loadings is not so substantial despite the significantly increased carbon amount (19.4 and 25 wt., respectively).It reveals that at 4.2 wt. of deposited ZnS the effect of CTAB intercalation to the MMT interlayer is comparable to that for 3.1 wt. of ZnS and thus the significantly decreased specific surface area of 4.2 wt. ZnS/MMT nanocomposite (0.9 m 2 /g) can be caused by plugging of MMT mesopores and macropores by additional CTAB as well as ZnS nanoparticles or their agglomerates, e.g. in the pore mouths.The observations from XRD pretty support the observations from nitrogen physisorption. The position of the 0 0 1 diffraction peak in MMT and corresponding inter-planar distances d001 with estimated errors.Arising from previous knowledge about possible agglomeration of ZnS nanoparticles stabilized by CTAB 52 and in order to support hypotheses about plugging of MMT porous structure also by ZnS nanoparticles/agglomerates, the TEM analysis of ZnS/MMT nanocomposites was performed as well.The TEM micrographs showing ZnS agglomerates of different sizes deposited on the external surface of MMT are shown in Fig. 4a andb.A detailed view of one ZnS agglomerate revealed that the agglomerates were composed of individual ZnS nanoparticles with sizes of about 20-40 nm.It is in contrast with determined gap energies (see below) corresponding to sizes equal and smaller than 10 nm when the quantum size effect occurs.This apparent disagreement indicates that ZnS nanoparticles of different sizes as well as agglomerated in large agglomerates with sizes of several hundred nanometers exist on MMT.Formation of agglomerates is key for understanding different photocatalytic efficiency discussed below. Since the same ZnS suspension was used for the preparation of all ZnS/MMT nanocomposites, the size of ZnS nanoparticles does not determine the differences between them.As reported in our previous study 28, ZnS nanoparticles and CTAB form agglomerates attached. The mean size of ZnS nanoparticles was estimated from their optical properties in a suspension, i.e. before they were deposited on MMT.The well described size-dependence of absorption spectra was considered and the effective mass approximation was utilized to obtain the size of ZnS nanoparticles from the following Brus equation 53: where E bg (bulk) and E bg (nano) are the band bap energies of bulk and nano-sized semiconductors, respectively, h is the Planck' constant, m e and m h are the effective masses of electron and hole, respectively, and is the dielectric constant of the material.Here, m e 0.42 m 0 and m h 0.61 m 0 , where m 0 is the free electron mass and the dielectric constant e 8.76 54.The band gap energy of ZnS nanoparticles was estimated from the linear part of the (h ) 0.5 versus (h ) plot as described in our previous work 28.Fig. 5 shows the UV-vis spectra of ZnS/MMT nanocomposites.The band gap energy of ZnS/MMT with 2.0 wt. of ZnS was 3.65 eV (Table 1).This value is close to that band gap energy reported for bulk ZnS (3.6-3.7 eV) 55.The band gap energy of ZnS/MMT increased with increasing concentration of ZnS up to 3.84 eV for 4.2 wt. ZnS/MMT.Previously, it has been reported that the increase in band gap energy is a result of reduction in the particle size of ZnS that is related to the quantum confinement effects 565758 a vacuum, is the dielectric constant for the ZnS (8.76), h is the Planck constant and e is the charge of an electron.Diameter (2R) of studied materials has been estimated to be 10.0 nm, 7.2 nm and 5.7 nm for ZnS/MMT with 2.0 wt., 3.1 wt. and 4.2 wt. of ZnS.The absolute values of ZnS particles calculated from UV-vis are affected by used E 0 value that has been reported to be 3.6-3.7 eV and the dielectric constant for the ZnS.This is probably a reason, why the absolute value of ZnS particles calculated from UV-vis is lower than those values determined from TEM.Nevertheless, it brings attractive connection between TEM and UV-vis results.It is surprising that the particle diameter of ZnS calculated from the band gap energy (Table 1) decreases with increasing ZnS loading.Moreover, it is in contrast to TEM results.This effect can be explained by clustering of ZnS particles with approximately of the same nano-size.While 2.0 wt. ZnS/MMT contains separated ZnS nanoparticles with approximately the same diameter of 20-40 nm (TEM-Fig.4a), 4.2 wt. ZnS/MMT contains both ZnS nanoparticles and ZnS agglomerates of micrometer-size composed of many of ZnS nanoparticles (TEM-Fig.4b).Based on that fact the decrease in the band gap energy can be associated with the dominant effect of the presence of higher amount of ZnS nanoparticles and lower amount of ZnS agglomerates. ZnS/MMT nanocomposites with different contents of ZnS were investigated for the photoreduction of CO 2 dissolved in NaOH solutions.The commercial TiO 2 Evonic P25 photocatalyst was examined as a reference for comparison.The effect of irradiation time on the formation of products was investigated over a period of 0-24 h.Fig. 6 shows the evolution of all reaction products as the functions of the irradiation for the 3.1 wt. ZnS/MMT nanocomposite.The main gaseous product was methane.Hydrogen and low amounts of carbon monoxide were also detected.Other products such as formic acid, formaldehyde, ethane and ethylene could also be formed 22,59, but they were undetectable in our GC configuration.The observed yields (mol/g cat ) order was: H 2 CH 4 CO. Comparisons of CH 4 , H 2 and CO yields over ZnS/MMT with different contents of ZnS are shown in Fig. 7a-c, respectively.A gradual increase of methane yield was observed after the start of irradiation with the exception of commercial TiO 2 catalyst.In this case the yields of methane were negligible during the first 8 h of irradiation.The highest yield of methane was observed for 3.1 wt. ZnS/MMT. In case of ZnS/MMT, the hydrogen yields continually increased during the whole experiments.In comparison with the application of commercial titanium dioxide, hydrogen was produced in 6-fold higher concentrations (Fig. 7b).The yields of carbon monoxide were increasing slowly during the reaction, but all yields were close to the limit of detection (Fig. 7c).The highest yield of both products was observed for 3.1 wt. ZnS/MMT. The data from the longest reaction time span were chosen for the overall comparison because the yields of all products were the highest and the most accurate.The results show that the photocatalytic performance of nanocomposites varies with the content of ZnS in the order of 3.1 wt. ZnS 4.2 wt. ZnS 2.0 wt. ZnS.All yields of products for ZnS/MMT nanocomposites were higher than those for the commercial photocatalyst Evonic P25.According to the blank test, the original montmorillonite does not possess any photocatalytic performance. Regarding the possible formation of reaction products in a consequence of some carbon content from CTAB presented, it is worth to mention that the formation of methane was already investigated with the developed type of nanocomposite within the blank experiments at various pH in our previous study 60.The generation of methane was observed, the effect of different pH on the methane yields was comparable.However, in our study the evolution of photocatalytic performance of ZnS/MMT nanocomposites does not follow the trend in increasing carbon content (within increasing ZnS loading), thus the determined trend in photocatalytic performance can be considered as not burdened with this fact and correct. One would assume that with increasing loading of ZnS nanoparticles, which is the only active component in the ZnS/MMT nanocomposites, the photocatalytic performance of investigated nanocomposites would escalate.However, this hypothesis was not confirmed.According to the blank test, the original montmorillonite does not possess any photocatalytic performance.Besides that, 4.2 wt. of ZnS on MMT does not assign the highest photocatalytic performance.The overall order of photocatalytic performance in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 was following: 3.1 wt. ZnS 4.2 wt. ZnS 2.0 wt. ZnS.It is evident that with higher content of ZnS the nanocomposite photocatalytic performance in the first instance increases, but then there is a decline.This indicates that probably besides the ZnS loading, also the degree of agglomeration of ZnS nanoparticles plays a key role.The agglomeration of ZnS nanoparticles increases with increasing ZnS loading as it is evident from the results of TEM and UV-vis and it could be correlated with the work function as follows.The work function is the minimum energy that must be given to an electron to liberate it from the surface of ZnS nanoparticle.If ZnS occurs on MMT as same-size nanoparticles in various ZnS loadings, the work function should be same.We suppose, if such ZnS nanoparticles agglomerate and the degree of their agglomeration is too high, the work function should be higher.In our case with increasing ZnS loading the nanoparticles agglomerate and the lowest work function is achieved for 3.1 wt. of ZnS in MMT, when ZnS is partially as separated nanoparticles and partially as agglomerates.This evidences the correlation between the degree of ZnS nanoparticles agglomeration and the work function.Fig. 8 shows the correlation between the yields of methane after 24 h of irradiation and the work function of each catalyst.It can be seen from Fig. 8 that the lowest electron work function corresponds to the most active catalyst.This observation is in agreement with our previous observations over cerium doped TiO 2 nanoparticulated photocatalysts in the same reaction 61 and corresponds to the reaction mechanism.The photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide is conducted via generated electrons and the 3.1 wt. ZnS/MMT nanocomposite releases those electrons most easily.Contrary to that, pristine montmorillonite shows no photocatalytic performance, corresponding nicely to very high electron work function. The valence band of sulfide semiconductors, made of 3p orbitals of the sulfur atoms, is shifted upwards compared with those of the oxide analogues, while the conduction band electrons are also more reductive 62.For the CO 2 photocatalytic reduction the electron energy in conduction band must be higher than H reduction potential and the hole energy in valence band must be lower than OH -oxidation potentials.ZnS is a direct wide band gap semiconductor (Eg 3.6 eV in the bulk) 63, hence it absorbs only in the UV range, but it possesses a strongly reducing conduction band (E CB -1.85V versus the NHE at pH 7) 64.The addition of ZnS to MMT should result in changing the band gap and the absorption edge energies can be expected and was also experimentally demonstrated (see Fig. 5).However, it is always difficult to predict separately the shift of conduction and valence band energies, which are extremely important with respect to required oxidation and reduction potentials. The work function for different ZnS contents shown in Fig. 8 can help us to elucidate the shifts of conduction as well as valence bands.For simplicity the Fermi level on nanoparticle surface is supposed to be pinned to the middle of the nanoparticle band gap.Deriving from Figs. 5 and8 and Table 1, we can estimate that the energy of electrons on the conduction band edge is -2.066 eV, while the valence band edge is -5.716 eV for 2.0 wt. ZnS/MMT (Fig. 9a).For 3.1 wt. ZnS/MMT the energy of electrons on the conduction band edge increases about approximately 134 meV, while the valence band edge shifts up by 54 meV.Further increase of ZnS content up to 4.2 wt. led only to a much smaller conduction band decrease (21 meV), whereas the valence band edge shifts down by 89 meV.These shifts are depicted in Fig. 9b.Higher levels of the conduction band are more effective for the creation of H ions which are necessary for CO 2 reduction.It can be concluded that for 3.1 wt. of ZnS the carriers have the most suitable potentials for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 . In summary: Since the optical and electronic properties of nanocomposites have been considered as key properties related to the mechanism of CO 2 photocatalytic reduction and there exist the correlation between the band gap energy, the nanoparticle work function and the degree of agglomeration of nanoparticles, the behavior of ZnS on nano-size level plays the determining role.The shift in conduction band and valence band energies of ZnS at different ZnS loadings is a consequence of different degree of ZnS nanoparticles agglomeration on MMT."}, {"llm generation": "ZnS/MMT nanocomposites", "source": "ZnS nanoparticles stabilized by cetyltrimethylammonium bromide were deposited on montmorillonite (MMT) forming the ZnS/MMT nanocomposites with ZnS loadings within 2.0-4.2wt..", "context": "ZnS nanoparticles stabilized by cetyltrimethylammonium bromide were deposited on montmorillonite (MMT) forming the ZnS/MMT nanocomposites with ZnS loadings within 2.0-4.2wt..The key role in the performance of ZnS/MMT nanocomposites in the CO 2 photocatalytic reduction played the energies of electrons and holes within the electronic structure of designed photocatalytic materials, which were in fact affected by ZnS loadings.The potentials of electrons and holes required for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 were the most suitable for the 3.1 wt.

ZnS/MMT.The second variation, the ratio of ZnS suspension volume to MMT weight was varied from 1:2 (L:g) to 1:4 and 1:8, resulting in nanocomposites denoted as 3.1 wt. ZnS/MMT and 2.0 wt. ZnS/MMT. The content of ZnS in ZnS/MMT nanocomposites was determined by elemental analysis of sulphur performed by a combustion analyser ELTRA (Eltra, Germany) and determination of zinc after their dissolution in a mixture of HF, HNO 3 and HClO 4 41 by an atomic absorption spectrometer AA280FS (Varian Inc., Austria). The nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurements at 77 K were performed using the volumetric apparatus Nova2000e (Quntachrome, USA).Prior to the nitrogen physisorption measurements, the samples were degassed at 105 C for 4 h under vacuum less than 1 Pa.Degassing at temperature of 105 C was applied in order to remove physisorbed water, however, with no influence on the textural or structural properties of investigated nanocomposites.The specific surface area, S BET , was calculated according to the classical Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) theory for the relative pressure range p/p 0 0.05-0.3042.Since the specific surface area, S BET , is not such a proper parameter in the case of mesoporous solids containing some micropores 42,43, the mesopore surface area, S meso , and the micropore volume, V micro , were additionally also evaluated based on the t-plot method 44, using DeBoer standard isotherm.The net pore volume, V net , was determined from the nitrogen adsorption isotherm at maximum p/p 0 (0.991).The mesoporesize distribution (pore diameter 3-130 nm) was evaluated from the adsorption branch of the nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm by the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method 45, using the DeBoer standard isotherm and the assumption of the cylindrical pore geometry. The X-ray diffraction powder (XRD) patterns were measured by a standard laboratory diffractometer in the conventional focusing Bragg-Brentano geometry with variable slits (Ni-filtered Cu K, 1.4 kW).A linear detector was used to collect the scattered intensity. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations were carried out on a JEOL 2010F microscope operated at 200 kV (LaB6 cathode, resolution 0.19 nm) using carbon coated copper grid. UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of prepared samples (grain size 0.160 mm) were measured by using a GBS CINTRA 303 spectrometer equipped with a Spectralon-coated integrating sphere using a Spectralon coated discs as a standard.The spectra were recorded in the range of the wavelength 200-800 nm (lamps switched at 350 nm).The reflectances were re-calculated to the absorption using the Schuster-Kubelka-Munk equation, where R is the diffuse reflectance from a semi-infinite layer.The obtained spectra were transformed to the dependencies (F(R )h ) 2 against h and assuming that the Tauc's law 46,47 can be expressed as: , where the Eg is the energy of absorption edge values (determined from obtained plots), h is the Planck constant and is the light frequency.Kubelka-Munk function was used to estimate the band gap energy of prepared photocatalysts.The optical absorption threshold (lg) was calculated using the equation, lg 1240/EB, where EB is the band gap energy. The contact potential difference (V CPD ) measurements were carried out by the dynamic condenser method of Kelvin with a KP6500 probe (McAllister Technical Services).The reference electrode was a standard stainless steel plate with diameter of 3 mm ( r ef 4.3 eV) provided by the manufacturer.During the measurements the gradient of the peak-to-peak versus backing potential was set to 0.2, whereas the vibration frequency and amplitude was set to 120 Hz and 40 a.u.The final V CPD value was an average of 60 independent points using two backing potentials.The measurements were carried out under atmospheric pressure and ambient temperature.Before measurements the samples were pressed into pellets of 10 mm diameter using the 8 MPa pressure.The work function values were obtained from a simple relation V CPD ref - sample . The photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide was carried out in a stirred batch annular reactor with a suspended catalyst illuminated by the UV 8 W Hg-lamp (254 nm).The CO 2 diffusion from the gas phase through the gas-liquid interface in a laboratory batch slurry reactor was eliminated by saturating the aqueous solutions of 0.2 mmol/L NaOH with pure CO 2 before the beginning of reactions.During this step, pH decreased from 11.8 to 6.6.The catalyst loading of 1 g/L was chosen to avoid the concentration gradients in a bulk of stirred liquid with the dispersion due to a scattering effect of light as a result of the high nanocomposite concentration.A suitable volume of 100 mL of the liquid phase was used to ensure the perfect mixing in this photoreactor 48.CO 2 reduction products, such as hydrogen, methane and carbon monoxide, were analysed by a gas chromatograph (GC-Agilent Technologies 6890N) equipped with FID and TCD detectors (GC/FID/TCD) and the Molsieve and HP Poraplot Q columns.The calibration with certified calibration gases (0.05 mol.CH 4 , 0.987 mol.H 2 , 2.02 mol.CO, and 99.999 mol.CO 2 ) was performed before each experimental run. Concerning the chemical composition of nanocomposites, the elemental analysis and atomic absorption spectroscopy confirmed that investigated ZnS/MMT nanocomposites contained 4.2 wt., 3.1 wt. and 2.0 wt. of ZnS.In frame of these analyses some content of carbon in individual nanocomposites was also determined as follows: 25.0 wt., 19.4 wt. and 12.0 wt..The source of carbon was the stabilizing cationic surfactant CTAB. With respect to potential application of developed ZnS/MMT nanocomposites in liquid systems, their stability was explored in our previous works 49,50, via their shaking in water for 24 h.The dispersions were filtered and the UV-vis absorption spectra of filtrates were recorded.There was not detected any typical absorption edge of ZnS nanoparticles at about 320 nm in absorption spectra which means that the ZnS nanoparticles were firmly attached to MMT likely located in its pores 49.The stability of ZnS/MMT nanocomposites was also confirmed by the derived mathematical model 50. Fig. 1a and b shows measured nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms and evaluated pore-size distributions of investigated ZnS/MMT nanocomposites.Textural properties are summarized in Table 1.The shapes of nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms of all ZnS/MMT nanocomposites correspond to porous materials possessing dominantly larger mesopores/macropores.In addition to that, it is evident from Fig. 1a that pristine MMT possesses besides large mesopores/macropores also a small portion of micropores (pores with diameter 2 nm, V micro 2 mm 3 liq /g).According to previous research 51, the missing smallest pores in all ZnS/MMT nanocomposites and decreasing nanocomposite specific surface area can be attributed to a plugging of some part of the MMT porous structure, evidently of micropores and smaller mesopores, by CTAB which was used for ZnS/MMT nanocomposites synthesis and whose presence was proved by the determined carbon content by using AAS and elemental analysis.It was reported that the specific surface area of MMT can diminish due to the plugging of MMT porous structure by CTAB up to 4.4 m 2 /g 51.This indicates that further strongly decreased specific surface area of the 4.2 wt. ZnS/MMT nanocomposite (0.9 m 2 /g) may be a result of the secondary effect-incorporation of ZnS nanoparticles and/or ZnS agglomerates to MMT meso-macroporous structure.This phenomenon corresponds to Fig. 1b where pores with diameter 13 nm are evidently disappearing with increasing loading of ZnS nanoparticles from 3.1 to 4.2 wt.. The XRD measurements were performed in order to reveal the crystal structure of ZnS nanoparticles and to determine the inter-planar distance of 0 0 1 planes (d 001 ) of MMT.The diffraction patterns for all the samples including pristine MMT are displayed in Fig. 2a.While the presence of crystalline quartz (trigonal SiO 2 , space group P3 2 21) can be clearly seen, ZnS in any common crystalline form (sphalerite-cubic, F4; -3m; wurtzite-hexagonal, P6 3 mc) cannot be proved.This observation might be caused either by very small ZnS crystallite size or due to small amounts of ZnS nanoparticles (2-4.2 wt.) in the ZnS/MMT nanocomposites since possible ZnS peaks may coincide with those coming from MMT or quartz. The diffraction maxima corresponding to d 001 planes in MMT are displayed in detail in Fig. 2b for all the samples.A shift of the 0 0 1 diffraction peaks corresponding to an increase of the inter-planar distance d 001 with increasing concentration of ZnS can be observed (Table 2).This effect can be explained by the presence of some carbon amounts (12-25 wt.) in all the ZnS/MMT nanocomposites, which come from CTAB used during the deposition of ZnS nanoparticles and is intercalated in the MMT interlayer and thus increases the d 001 distance of MMT.This feature also pretty correlates with the decreasing specific surface area of investigated nanocomposites in the order 2.0 wt. ZnS/MMT 3.1 wt. ZnS/MMT 4.2 wt. ZnS/MMT as a consequence of increasing carbon amounts 12, 19.4 and 25 wt., respectively.However, from Table 2 and Fig. 3 is evident that the change in the inter-planar distance d 001 of MMT at 3.1 wt. and 4.2 wt. ZnS loadings is not so substantial despite the significantly increased carbon amount (19.4 and 25 wt., respectively).It reveals that at 4.2 wt. of deposited ZnS the effect of CTAB intercalation to the MMT interlayer is comparable to that for 3.1 wt. of ZnS and thus the significantly decreased specific surface area of 4.2 wt. ZnS/MMT nanocomposite (0.9 m 2 /g) can be caused by plugging of MMT mesopores and macropores by additional CTAB as well as ZnS nanoparticles or their agglomerates, e.g. in the pore mouths.The observations from XRD pretty support the observations from nitrogen physisorption. The position of the 0 0 1 diffraction peak in MMT and corresponding inter-planar distances d001 with estimated errors.Arising from previous knowledge about possible agglomeration of ZnS nanoparticles stabilized by CTAB 52 and in order to support hypotheses about plugging of MMT porous structure also by ZnS nanoparticles/agglomerates, the TEM analysis of ZnS/MMT nanocomposites was performed as well.The TEM micrographs showing ZnS agglomerates of different sizes deposited on the external surface of MMT are shown in Fig. 4a andb.A detailed view of one ZnS agglomerate revealed that the agglomerates were composed of individual ZnS nanoparticles with sizes of about 20-40 nm.It is in contrast with determined gap energies (see below) corresponding to sizes equal and smaller than 10 nm when the quantum size effect occurs.This apparent disagreement indicates that ZnS nanoparticles of different sizes as well as agglomerated in large agglomerates with sizes of several hundred nanometers exist on MMT.Formation of agglomerates is key for understanding different photocatalytic efficiency discussed below. Since the same ZnS suspension was used for the preparation of all ZnS/MMT nanocomposites, the size of ZnS nanoparticles does not determine the differences between them.As reported in our previous study 28, ZnS nanoparticles and CTAB form agglomerates attached. The mean size of ZnS nanoparticles was estimated from their optical properties in a suspension, i.e. before they were deposited on MMT.The well described size-dependence of absorption spectra was considered and the effective mass approximation was utilized to obtain the size of ZnS nanoparticles from the following Brus equation 53: where E bg (bulk) and E bg (nano) are the band bap energies of bulk and nano-sized semiconductors, respectively, h is the Planck' constant, m e and m h are the effective masses of electron and hole, respectively, and is the dielectric constant of the material.Here, m e 0.42 m 0 and m h 0.61 m 0 , where m 0 is the free electron mass and the dielectric constant e 8.76 54.The band gap energy of ZnS nanoparticles was estimated from the linear part of the (h ) 0.5 versus (h ) plot as described in our previous work 28.Fig. 5 shows the UV-vis spectra of ZnS/MMT nanocomposites.The band gap energy of ZnS/MMT with 2.0 wt. of ZnS was 3.65 eV (Table 1).This value is close to that band gap energy reported for bulk ZnS (3.6-3.7 eV) 55.The band gap energy of ZnS/MMT increased with increasing concentration of ZnS up to 3.84 eV for 4.2 wt. ZnS/MMT.Previously, it has been reported that the increase in band gap energy is a result of reduction in the particle size of ZnS that is related to the quantum confinement effects 565758 a vacuum, is the dielectric constant for the ZnS (8.76), h is the Planck constant and e is the charge of an electron.Diameter (2R) of studied materials has been estimated to be 10.0 nm, 7.2 nm and 5.7 nm for ZnS/MMT with 2.0 wt., 3.1 wt. and 4.2 wt. of ZnS.The absolute values of ZnS particles calculated from UV-vis are affected by used E 0 value that has been reported to be 3.6-3.7 eV and the dielectric constant for the ZnS.This is probably a reason, why the absolute value of ZnS particles calculated from UV-vis is lower than those values determined from TEM.Nevertheless, it brings attractive connection between TEM and UV-vis results.It is surprising that the particle diameter of ZnS calculated from the band gap energy (Table 1) decreases with increasing ZnS loading.Moreover, it is in contrast to TEM results.This effect can be explained by clustering of ZnS particles with approximately of the same nano-size.While 2.0 wt. ZnS/MMT contains separated ZnS nanoparticles with approximately the same diameter of 20-40 nm (TEM-Fig.4a), 4.2 wt. ZnS/MMT contains both ZnS nanoparticles and ZnS agglomerates of micrometer-size composed of many of ZnS nanoparticles (TEM-Fig.4b).Based on that fact the decrease in the band gap energy can be associated with the dominant effect of the presence of higher amount of ZnS nanoparticles and lower amount of ZnS agglomerates. ZnS/MMT nanocomposites with different contents of ZnS were investigated for the photoreduction of CO 2 dissolved in NaOH solutions.The commercial TiO 2 Evonic P25 photocatalyst was examined as a reference for comparison.The effect of irradiation time on the formation of products was investigated over a period of 0-24 h.Fig. 6 shows the evolution of all reaction products as the functions of the irradiation for the 3.1 wt. ZnS/MMT nanocomposite.The main gaseous product was methane.Hydrogen and low amounts of carbon monoxide were also detected.Other products such as formic acid, formaldehyde, ethane and ethylene could also be formed 22,59, but they were undetectable in our GC configuration.The observed yields (mol/g cat ) order was: H 2 CH 4 CO. Comparisons of CH 4 , H 2 and CO yields over ZnS/MMT with different contents of ZnS are shown in Fig. 7a-c, respectively.A gradual increase of methane yield was observed after the start of irradiation with the exception of commercial TiO 2 catalyst.In this case the yields of methane were negligible during the first 8 h of irradiation.The highest yield of methane was observed for 3.1 wt. ZnS/MMT. In case of ZnS/MMT, the hydrogen yields continually increased during the whole experiments.In comparison with the application of commercial titanium dioxide, hydrogen was produced in 6-fold higher concentrations (Fig. 7b).The yields of carbon monoxide were increasing slowly during the reaction, but all yields were close to the limit of detection (Fig. 7c).The highest yield of both products was observed for 3.1 wt. ZnS/MMT. The data from the longest reaction time span were chosen for the overall comparison because the yields of all products were the highest and the most accurate.The results show that the photocatalytic performance of nanocomposites varies with the content of ZnS in the order of 3.1 wt. ZnS 4.2 wt. ZnS 2.0 wt. ZnS.All yields of products for ZnS/MMT nanocomposites were higher than those for the commercial photocatalyst Evonic P25.According to the blank test, the original montmorillonite does not possess any photocatalytic performance. Regarding the possible formation of reaction products in a consequence of some carbon content from CTAB presented, it is worth to mention that the formation of methane was already investigated with the developed type of nanocomposite within the blank experiments at various pH in our previous study 60.The generation of methane was observed, the effect of different pH on the methane yields was comparable.However, in our study the evolution of photocatalytic performance of ZnS/MMT nanocomposites does not follow the trend in increasing carbon content (within increasing ZnS loading), thus the determined trend in photocatalytic performance can be considered as not burdened with this fact and correct. One would assume that with increasing loading of ZnS nanoparticles, which is the only active component in the ZnS/MMT nanocomposites, the photocatalytic performance of investigated nanocomposites would escalate.However, this hypothesis was not confirmed.According to the blank test, the original montmorillonite does not possess any photocatalytic performance.Besides that, 4.2 wt. of ZnS on MMT does not assign the highest photocatalytic performance.The overall order of photocatalytic performance in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 was following: 3.1 wt. ZnS 4.2 wt. ZnS 2.0 wt. ZnS.It is evident that with higher content of ZnS the nanocomposite photocatalytic performance in the first instance increases, but then there is a decline.This indicates that probably besides the ZnS loading, also the degree of agglomeration of ZnS nanoparticles plays a key role.The agglomeration of ZnS nanoparticles increases with increasing ZnS loading as it is evident from the results of TEM and UV-vis and it could be correlated with the work function as follows.The work function is the minimum energy that must be given to an electron to liberate it from the surface of ZnS nanoparticle.If ZnS occurs on MMT as same-size nanoparticles in various ZnS loadings, the work function should be same.We suppose, if such ZnS nanoparticles agglomerate and the degree of their agglomeration is too high, the work function should be higher.In our case with increasing ZnS loading the nanoparticles agglomerate and the lowest work function is achieved for 3.1 wt. of ZnS in MMT, when ZnS is partially as separated nanoparticles and partially as agglomerates.This evidences the correlation between the degree of ZnS nanoparticles agglomeration and the work function.Fig. 8 shows the correlation between the yields of methane after 24 h of irradiation and the work function of each catalyst.It can be seen from Fig. 8 that the lowest electron work function corresponds to the most active catalyst.This observation is in agreement with our previous observations over cerium doped TiO 2 nanoparticulated photocatalysts in the same reaction 61 and corresponds to the reaction mechanism.The photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide is conducted via generated electrons and the 3.1 wt. ZnS/MMT nanocomposite releases those electrons most easily.Contrary to that, pristine montmorillonite shows no photocatalytic performance, corresponding nicely to very high electron work function. The valence band of sulfide semiconductors, made of 3p orbitals of the sulfur atoms, is shifted upwards compared with those of the oxide analogues, while the conduction band electrons are also more reductive 62.For the CO 2 photocatalytic reduction the electron energy in conduction band must be higher than H reduction potential and the hole energy in valence band must be lower than OH -oxidation potentials.ZnS is a direct wide band gap semiconductor (Eg 3.6 eV in the bulk) 63, hence it absorbs only in the UV range, but it possesses a strongly reducing conduction band (E CB -1.85V versus the NHE at pH 7) 64.The addition of ZnS to MMT should result in changing the band gap and the absorption edge energies can be expected and was also experimentally demonstrated (see Fig. 5).However, it is always difficult to predict separately the shift of conduction and valence band energies, which are extremely important with respect to required oxidation and reduction potentials. The work function for different ZnS contents shown in Fig. 8 can help us to elucidate the shifts of conduction as well as valence bands.For simplicity the Fermi level on nanoparticle surface is supposed to be pinned to the middle of the nanoparticle band gap.Deriving from Figs. 5 and8 and Table 1, we can estimate that the energy of electrons on the conduction band edge is -2.066 eV, while the valence band edge is -5.716 eV for 2.0 wt. ZnS/MMT (Fig. 9a).For 3.1 wt. ZnS/MMT the energy of electrons on the conduction band edge increases about approximately 134 meV, while the valence band edge shifts up by 54 meV.Further increase of ZnS content up to 4.2 wt. led only to a much smaller conduction band decrease (21 meV), whereas the valence band edge shifts down by 89 meV.These shifts are depicted in Fig. 9b.Higher levels of the conduction band are more effective for the creation of H ions which are necessary for CO 2 reduction.It can be concluded that for 3.1 wt. of ZnS the carriers have the most suitable potentials for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 . In summary: Since the optical and electronic properties of nanocomposites have been considered as key properties related to the mechanism of CO 2 photocatalytic reduction and there exist the correlation between the band gap energy, the nanoparticle work function and the degree of agglomeration of nanoparticles, the behavior of ZnS on nano-size level plays the determining role.The shift in conduction band and valence band energies of ZnS at different ZnS loadings is a consequence of different degree of ZnS nanoparticles agglomeration on MMT. ZnS nanoparticles stabilized by cetyltrimethylammonium bromide were deposited on montmorillonite (MMT) forming the ZnS/MMT nanocomposites with ZnS loadings within 2.0-4.2wt..The key role in the performance of ZnS/MMT nanocomposites in the CO 2 photocatalytic reduction played the energies of electrons and holes within the electronic structure of designed photocatalytic materials, which were in fact affected by ZnS loadings.The potentials of electrons and holes required for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 were the most suitable for the 3.1 wt. ZnS/MMT nanocomposite.All prepared ZnS/MMT nanocomposites exhibited higher efficiency in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction in comparison with the commercial TiO 2 Evonic P25.

Fig. 1a and b shows measured nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms and evaluated pore-size distributions of investigated ZnS/MMT nanocomposites.Textural properties are summarized in Table 1.The shapes of nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms of all ZnS/MMT nanocomposites correspond to porous materials possessing dominantly larger mesopores/macropores.In addition to that, it is evident from Fig. 1a that pristine MMT possesses besides large mesopores/macropores also a small portion of micropores (pores with diameter 2 nm, V micro 2 mm 3 liq /g).According to previous research 51, the missing smallest pores in all ZnS/MMT nanocomposites and decreasing nanocomposite specific surface area can be attributed to a plugging of some part of the MMT porous structure, evidently of micropores and smaller mesopores, by CTAB which was used for ZnS/MMT nanocomposites synthesis and whose presence was proved by the determined carbon content by using AAS and elemental analysis.It was reported that the specific surface area of MMT can diminish due to the plugging of MMT porous structure by CTAB up to 4.4 m 2 /g 51.This indicates that further strongly decreased specific surface area of the 4.2 wt. ZnS/MMT nanocomposite (0.9 m 2 /g) may be a result of the secondary effect-incorporation of ZnS nanoparticles and/or ZnS agglomerates to MMT meso-macroporous structure.This phenomenon corresponds to Fig. 1b where pores with diameter 13 nm are evidently disappearing with increasing loading of ZnS nanoparticles from 3.1 to 4.2 wt.. The XRD measurements were performed in order to reveal the crystal structure of ZnS nanoparticles and to determine the inter-planar distance of 0 0 1 planes (d 001 ) of MMT.The diffraction patterns for all the samples including pristine MMT are displayed in Fig. 2a.While the presence of crystalline quartz (trigonal SiO 2 , space group P3 2 21) can be clearly seen, ZnS in any common crystalline form (sphalerite-cubic, F4; -3m; wurtzite-hexagonal, P6 3 mc) cannot be proved.This observation might be caused either by very small ZnS crystallite size or due to small amounts of ZnS nanoparticles (2-4.2 wt.) in the ZnS/MMT nanocomposites since possible ZnS peaks may coincide with those coming from MMT or quartz. The diffraction maxima corresponding to d 001 planes in MMT are displayed in detail in Fig. 2b for all the samples.A shift of the 0 0 1 diffraction peaks corresponding to an increase of the inter-planar distance d 001 with increasing concentration of ZnS can be observed (Table 2).This effect can be explained by the presence of some carbon amounts (12-25 wt.) in all the ZnS/MMT nanocomposites, which come from CTAB used during the deposition of ZnS nanoparticles and is intercalated in the MMT interlayer and thus increases the d 001 distance of MMT.This feature also pretty correlates with the decreasing specific surface area of investigated nanocomposites in the order 2.0 wt. ZnS/MMT 3.1 wt. ZnS/MMT 4.2 wt. ZnS/MMT as a consequence of increasing carbon amounts 12, 19.4 and 25 wt., respectively.However, from Table 2 and Fig. 3 is evident that the change in the inter-planar distance d 001 of MMT at 3.1 wt. and 4.2 wt. ZnS loadings is not so substantial despite the significantly increased carbon amount (19.4 and 25 wt., respectively).It reveals that at 4.2 wt. of deposited ZnS the effect of CTAB intercalation to the MMT interlayer is comparable to that for 3.1 wt. of ZnS and thus the significantly decreased specific surface area of 4.2 wt. ZnS/MMT nanocomposite (0.9 m 2 /g) can be caused by plugging of MMT mesopores and macropores by additional CTAB as well as ZnS nanoparticles or their agglomerates, e.g. in the pore mouths.The observations from XRD pretty support the observations from nitrogen physisorption. The position of the 0 0 1 diffraction peak in MMT and corresponding inter-planar distances d001 with estimated errors.Arising from previous knowledge about possible agglomeration of ZnS nanoparticles stabilized by CTAB 52 and in order to support hypotheses about plugging of MMT porous structure also by ZnS nanoparticles/agglomerates, the TEM analysis of ZnS/MMT nanocomposites was performed as well.The TEM micrographs showing ZnS agglomerates of different sizes deposited on the external surface of MMT are shown in Fig. 4a andb.A detailed view of one ZnS agglomerate revealed that the agglomerates were composed of individual ZnS nanoparticles with sizes of about 20-40 nm.It is in contrast with determined gap energies (see below) corresponding to sizes equal and smaller than 10 nm when the quantum size effect occurs.This apparent disagreement indicates that ZnS nanoparticles of different sizes as well as agglomerated in large agglomerates with sizes of several hundred nanometers exist on MMT.Formation of agglomerates is key for understanding different photocatalytic efficiency discussed below. Since the same ZnS suspension was used for the preparation of all ZnS/MMT nanocomposites, the size of ZnS nanoparticles does not determine the differences between them.As reported in our previous study 28, ZnS nanoparticles and CTAB form agglomerates attached. The mean size of ZnS nanoparticles was estimated from their optical properties in a suspension, i.e. before they were deposited on MMT.The well described size-dependence of absorption spectra was considered and the effective mass approximation was utilized to obtain the size of ZnS nanoparticles from the following Brus equation 53: where E bg (bulk) and E bg (nano) are the band bap energies of bulk and nano-sized semiconductors, respectively, h is the Planck' constant, m e and m h are the effective masses of electron and hole, respectively, and is the dielectric constant of the material.Here, m e 0.42 m 0 and m h 0.61 m 0 , where m 0 is the free electron mass and the dielectric constant e 8.76 54.The band gap energy of ZnS nanoparticles was estimated from the linear part of the (h ) 0.5 versus (h ) plot as described in our previous work 28.Fig. 5 shows the UV-vis spectra of ZnS/MMT nanocomposites.The band gap energy of ZnS/MMT with 2.0 wt. of ZnS was 3.65 eV (Table 1).This value is close to that band gap energy reported for bulk ZnS (3.6-3.7 eV) 55.The band gap energy of ZnS/MMT increased with increasing concentration of ZnS up to 3.84 eV for 4.2 wt. ZnS/MMT.Previously, it has been reported that the increase in band gap energy is a result of reduction in the particle size of ZnS that is related to the quantum confinement effects 565758 a vacuum, is the dielectric constant for the ZnS (8.76), h is the Planck constant and e is the charge of an electron.Diameter (2R) of studied materials has been estimated to be 10.0 nm, 7.2 nm and 5.7 nm for ZnS/MMT with 2.0 wt., 3.1 wt. and 4.2 wt. of ZnS.The absolute values of ZnS particles calculated from UV-vis are affected by used E 0 value that has been reported to be 3.6-3.7 eV and the dielectric constant for the ZnS.This is probably a reason, why the absolute value of ZnS particles calculated from UV-vis is lower than those values determined from TEM.Nevertheless, it brings attractive connection between TEM and UV-vis results.It is surprising that the particle diameter of ZnS calculated from the band gap energy (Table 1) decreases with increasing ZnS loading.Moreover, it is in contrast to TEM results.This effect can be explained by clustering of ZnS particles with approximately of the same nano-size.While 2.0 wt. ZnS/MMT contains separated ZnS nanoparticles with approximately the same diameter of 20-40 nm (TEM-Fig.4a), 4.2 wt. ZnS/MMT contains both ZnS nanoparticles and ZnS agglomerates of micrometer-size composed of many of ZnS nanoparticles (TEM-Fig.4b).Based on that fact the decrease in the band gap energy can be associated with the dominant effect of the presence of higher amount of ZnS nanoparticles and lower amount of ZnS agglomerates. ZnS/MMT nanocomposites with different contents of ZnS were investigated for the photoreduction of CO 2 dissolved in NaOH solutions.The commercial TiO 2 Evonic P25 photocatalyst was examined as a reference for comparison.The effect of irradiation time on the formation of products was investigated over a period of 0-24 h.Fig. 6 shows the evolution of all reaction products as the functions of the irradiation for the 3.1 wt. ZnS/MMT nanocomposite.The main gaseous product was methane.Hydrogen and low amounts of carbon monoxide were also detected.Other products such as formic acid, formaldehyde, ethane and ethylene could also be formed 22,59, but they were undetectable in our GC configuration.The observed yields (mol/g cat ) order was: H 2 CH 4 CO. Comparisons of CH 4 , H 2 and CO yields over ZnS/MMT with different contents of ZnS are shown in Fig. 7a-c, respectively.A gradual increase of methane yield was observed after the start of irradiation with the exception of commercial TiO 2 catalyst.In this case the yields of methane were negligible during the first 8 h of irradiation.The highest yield of methane was observed for 3.1 wt. ZnS/MMT. In case of ZnS/MMT, the hydrogen yields continually increased during the whole experiments.In comparison with the application of commercial titanium dioxide, hydrogen was produced in 6-fold higher concentrations (Fig. 7b).The yields of carbon monoxide were increasing slowly during the reaction, but all yields were close to the limit of detection (Fig. 7c).The highest yield of both products was observed for 3.1 wt. ZnS/MMT. The data from the longest reaction time span were chosen for the overall comparison because the yields of all products were the highest and the most accurate.The results show that the photocatalytic performance of nanocomposites varies with the content of ZnS in the order of 3.1 wt. ZnS 4.2 wt. ZnS 2.0 wt. ZnS.All yields of products for ZnS/MMT nanocomposites were higher than those for the commercial photocatalyst Evonic P25.According to the blank test, the original montmorillonite does not possess any photocatalytic performance. Regarding the possible formation of reaction products in a consequence of some carbon content from CTAB presented, it is worth to mention that the formation of methane was already investigated with the developed type of nanocomposite within the blank experiments at various pH in our previous study 60.The generation of methane was observed, the effect of different pH on the methane yields was comparable.However, in our study the evolution of photocatalytic performance of ZnS/MMT nanocomposites does not follow the trend in increasing carbon content (within increasing ZnS loading), thus the determined trend in photocatalytic performance can be considered as not burdened with this fact and correct. One would assume that with increasing loading of ZnS nanoparticles, which is the only active component in the ZnS/MMT nanocomposites, the photocatalytic performance of investigated nanocomposites would escalate.However, this hypothesis was not confirmed.According to the blank test, the original montmorillonite does not possess any photocatalytic performance.Besides that, 4.2 wt. of ZnS on MMT does not assign the highest photocatalytic performance.The overall order of photocatalytic performance in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 was following: 3.1 wt. ZnS 4.2 wt. ZnS 2.0 wt. ZnS.It is evident that with higher content of ZnS the nanocomposite photocatalytic performance in the first instance increases, but then there is a decline.This indicates that probably besides the ZnS loading, also the degree of agglomeration of ZnS nanoparticles plays a key role.The agglomeration of ZnS nanoparticles increases with increasing ZnS loading as it is evident from the results of TEM and UV-vis and it could be correlated with the work function as follows.The work function is the minimum energy that must be given to an electron to liberate it from the surface of ZnS nanoparticle.If ZnS occurs on MMT as same-size nanoparticles in various ZnS loadings, the work function should be same.We suppose, if such ZnS nanoparticles agglomerate and the degree of their agglomeration is too high, the work function should be higher.In our case with increasing ZnS loading the nanoparticles agglomerate and the lowest work function is achieved for 3.1 wt. of ZnS in MMT, when ZnS is partially as separated nanoparticles and partially as agglomerates.This evidences the correlation between the degree of ZnS nanoparticles agglomeration and the work function.Fig. 8 shows the correlation between the yields of methane after 24 h of irradiation and the work function of each catalyst.It can be seen from Fig. 8 that the lowest electron work function corresponds to the most active catalyst.This observation is in agreement with our previous observations over cerium doped TiO 2 nanoparticulated photocatalysts in the same reaction 61 and corresponds to the reaction mechanism.The photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide is conducted via generated electrons and the 3.1 wt. ZnS/MMT nanocomposite releases those electrons most easily.Contrary to that, pristine montmorillonite shows no photocatalytic performance, corresponding nicely to very high electron work function. The valence band of sulfide semiconductors, made of 3p orbitals of the sulfur atoms, is shifted upwards compared with those of the oxide analogues, while the conduction band electrons are also more reductive 62.For the CO 2 photocatalytic reduction the electron energy in conduction band must be higher than H reduction potential and the hole energy in valence band must be lower than OH -oxidation potentials.ZnS is a direct wide band gap semiconductor (Eg 3.6 eV in the bulk) 63, hence it absorbs only in the UV range, but it possesses a strongly reducing conduction band (E CB -1.85V versus the NHE at pH 7) 64.The addition of ZnS to MMT should result in changing the band gap and the absorption edge energies can be expected and was also experimentally demonstrated (see Fig. 5).However, it is always difficult to predict separately the shift of conduction and valence band energies, which are extremely important with respect to required oxidation and reduction potentials. The work function for different ZnS contents shown in Fig. 8 can help us to elucidate the shifts of conduction as well as valence bands.For simplicity the Fermi level on nanoparticle surface is supposed to be pinned to the middle of the nanoparticle band gap.Deriving from Figs. 5 and8 and Table 1, we can estimate that the energy of electrons on the conduction band edge is -2.066 eV, while the valence band edge is -5.716 eV for 2.0 wt. ZnS/MMT (Fig. 9a).For 3.1 wt. ZnS/MMT the energy of electrons on the conduction band edge increases about approximately 134 meV, while the valence band edge shifts up by 54 meV.Further increase of ZnS content up to 4.2 wt. led only to a much smaller conduction band decrease (21 meV), whereas the valence band edge shifts down by 89 meV.These shifts are depicted in Fig. 9b.Higher levels of the conduction band are more effective for the creation of H ions which are necessary for CO 2 reduction.It can be concluded that for 3.1 wt. of ZnS the carriers have the most suitable potentials for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 . In summary: Since the optical and electronic properties of nanocomposites have been considered as key properties related to the mechanism of CO 2 photocatalytic reduction and there exist the correlation between the band gap energy, the nanoparticle work function and the degree of agglomeration of nanoparticles, the behavior of ZnS on nano-size level plays the determining role.The shift in conduction band and valence band energies of ZnS at different ZnS loadings is a consequence of different degree of ZnS nanoparticles agglomeration on MMT."}], "lamp": [{"llm generation": "Mercury", "source": "The photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide was carried out in a stirred batch annular reactor with a suspended catalyst illuminated by the UV 8 W Hg-lamp (254 nm).", "context": "Two-step preparation of ZnS/MMT was described in detail in our previous work 28.Briefly, ZnS nanoparticles were formed by adding of the sodium sulphide and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) solution (solution A) dropwise to the solution of zinc acetate (solution B).The ZnS-CTAB was subsequently deposited on montmorillonite by shaking 1 L of 2 mM ZnS solution with 2 g of MMT for 24 h followed by filtration, washing and drying.Two variations in the above-described synthesis were done in order to positively influence the resulting nanocomposite efficiency.The first one, the addition of the solution B to the solution A changes pH during the ZnS nanoparticles nucleation since sodium sulphide is a base.The composite obtained by shaking such formed ZnS nanoparticles with MMT was denoted as 4.2 wt. ZnS/MMT.The second variation, the ratio of ZnS suspension volume to MMT weight was varied from 1:2 (L:g) to 1:4 and 1:8, resulting in nanocomposites denoted as 3.1 wt. ZnS/MMT and 2.0 wt. ZnS/MMT. The content of ZnS in ZnS/MMT nanocomposites was determined by elemental analysis of sulphur performed by a combustion analyser ELTRA (Eltra, Germany) and determination of zinc after their dissolution in a mixture of HF, HNO 3 and HClO 4 41 by an atomic absorption spectrometer AA280FS (Varian Inc., Austria). The nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurements at 77 K were performed using the volumetric apparatus Nova2000e (Quntachrome, USA).Prior to the nitrogen physisorption measurements, the samples were degassed at 105 C for 4 h under vacuum less than 1 Pa.Degassing at temperature of 105 C was applied in order to remove physisorbed water, however, with no influence on the textural or structural properties of investigated nanocomposites.The specific surface area, S BET , was calculated according to the classical Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) theory for the relative pressure range p/p 0 0.05-0.3042.Since the specific surface area, S BET , is not such a proper parameter in the case of mesoporous solids containing some micropores 42,43, the mesopore surface area, S meso , and the micropore volume, V micro , were additionally also evaluated based on the t-plot method 44, using DeBoer standard isotherm.The net pore volume, V net , was determined from the nitrogen adsorption isotherm at maximum p/p 0 (0.991).The mesoporesize distribution (pore diameter 3-130 nm) was evaluated from the adsorption branch of the nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm by the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method 45, using the DeBoer standard isotherm and the assumption of the cylindrical pore geometry. The X-ray diffraction powder (XRD) patterns were measured by a standard laboratory diffractometer in the conventional focusing Bragg-Brentano geometry with variable slits (Ni-filtered Cu K, 1.4 kW).A linear detector was used to collect the scattered intensity. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations were carried out on a JEOL 2010F microscope operated at 200 kV (LaB6 cathode, resolution 0.19 nm) using carbon coated copper grid. UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of prepared samples (grain size 0.160 mm) were measured by using a GBS CINTRA 303 spectrometer equipped with a Spectralon-coated integrating sphere using a Spectralon coated discs as a standard.The spectra were recorded in the range of the wavelength 200-800 nm (lamps switched at 350 nm).The reflectances were re-calculated to the absorption using the Schuster-Kubelka-Munk equation, where R is the diffuse reflectance from a semi-infinite layer.The obtained spectra were transformed to the dependencies (F(R )h ) 2 against h and assuming that the Tauc's law 46,47 can be expressed as: , where the Eg is the energy of absorption edge values (determined from obtained plots), h is the Planck constant and is the light frequency.Kubelka-Munk function was used to estimate the band gap energy of prepared photocatalysts.The optical absorption threshold (lg) was calculated using the equation, lg 1240/EB, where EB is the band gap energy. The contact potential difference (V CPD ) measurements were carried out by the dynamic condenser method of Kelvin with a KP6500 probe (McAllister Technical Services).The reference electrode was a standard stainless steel plate with diameter of 3 mm ( r ef 4.3 eV) provided by the manufacturer.During the measurements the gradient of the peak-to-peak versus backing potential was set to 0.2, whereas the vibration frequency and amplitude was set to 120 Hz and 40 a.u.The final V CPD value was an average of 60 independent points using two backing potentials.The measurements were carried out under atmospheric pressure and ambient temperature.Before measurements the samples were pressed into pellets of 10 mm diameter using the 8 MPa pressure.The work function values were obtained from a simple relation V CPD ref - sample . The photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide was carried out in a stirred batch annular reactor with a suspended catalyst illuminated by the UV 8 W Hg-lamp (254 nm).The CO 2 diffusion from the gas phase through the gas-liquid interface in a laboratory batch slurry reactor was eliminated by saturating the aqueous solutions of 0.2 mmol/L NaOH with pure CO 2 before the beginning of reactions.During this step, pH decreased from 11.8 to 6.6.The catalyst loading of 1 g/L was chosen to avoid the concentration gradients in a bulk of stirred liquid with the dispersion due to a scattering effect of light as a result of the high nanocomposite concentration.A suitable volume of 100 mL of the liquid phase was used to ensure the perfect mixing in this photoreactor 48.CO 2 reduction products, such as hydrogen, methane and carbon monoxide, were analysed by a gas chromatograph (GC-Agilent Technologies 6890N) equipped with FID and TCD detectors (GC/FID/TCD) and the Molsieve and HP Poraplot Q columns.The calibration with certified calibration gases (0.05 mol.CH 4 , 0.987 mol.H 2 , 2.02 mol.CO, and 99.999 mol.CO 2 ) was performed before each experimental run. Concerning the chemical composition of nanocomposites, the elemental analysis and atomic absorption spectroscopy confirmed that investigated ZnS/MMT nanocomposites contained 4.2 wt., 3.1 wt. and 2.0 wt. of ZnS.In frame of these analyses some content of carbon in individual nanocomposites was also determined as follows: 25.0 wt., 19.4 wt. and 12.0 wt..The source of carbon was the stabilizing cationic surfactant CTAB. With respect to potential application of developed ZnS/MMT nanocomposites in liquid systems, their stability was explored in our previous works 49,50, via their shaking in water for 24 h.The dispersions were filtered and the UV-vis absorption spectra of filtrates were recorded.There was not detected any typical absorption edge of ZnS nanoparticles at about 320 nm in absorption spectra which means that the ZnS nanoparticles were firmly attached to MMT likely located in its pores 49.The stability of ZnS/MMT nanocomposites was also confirmed by the derived mathematical model 50. Fig. 1a and b shows measured nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms and evaluated pore-size distributions of investigated ZnS/MMT nanocomposites.Textural properties are summarized in Table 1.The shapes of nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms of all ZnS/MMT nanocomposites correspond to porous materials possessing dominantly larger mesopores/macropores.In addition to that, it is evident from Fig. 1a that pristine MMT possesses besides large mesopores/macropores also a small portion of micropores (pores with diameter 2 nm, V micro 2 mm 3 liq /g).According to previous research 51, the missing smallest pores in all ZnS/MMT nanocomposites and decreasing nanocomposite specific surface area can be attributed to a plugging of some part of the MMT porous structure, evidently of micropores and smaller mesopores, by CTAB which was used for ZnS/MMT nanocomposites synthesis and whose presence was proved by the determined carbon content by using AAS and elemental analysis.It was reported that the specific surface area of MMT can diminish due to the plugging of MMT porous structure by CTAB up to 4.4 m 2 /g 51.This indicates that further strongly decreased specific surface area of the 4.2 wt. ZnS/MMT nanocomposite (0.9 m 2 /g) may be a result of the secondary effect-incorporation of ZnS nanoparticles and/or ZnS agglomerates to MMT meso-macroporous structure.This phenomenon corresponds to Fig. 1b where pores with diameter 13 nm are evidently disappearing with increasing loading of ZnS nanoparticles from 3.1 to 4.2 wt.. The XRD measurements were performed in order to reveal the crystal structure of ZnS nanoparticles and to determine the inter-planar distance of 0 0 1 planes (d 001 ) of MMT.The diffraction patterns for all the samples including pristine MMT are displayed in Fig. 2a.While the presence of crystalline quartz (trigonal SiO 2 , space group P3 2 21) can be clearly seen, ZnS in any common crystalline form (sphalerite-cubic, F4; -3m; wurtzite-hexagonal, P6 3 mc) cannot be proved.This observation might be caused either by very small ZnS crystallite size or due to small amounts of ZnS nanoparticles (2-4.2 wt.) in the ZnS/MMT nanocomposites since possible ZnS peaks may coincide with those coming from MMT or quartz. The diffraction maxima corresponding to d 001 planes in MMT are displayed in detail in Fig. 2b for all the samples.A shift of the 0 0 1 diffraction peaks corresponding to an increase of the inter-planar distance d 001 with increasing concentration of ZnS can be observed (Table 2).This effect can be explained by the presence of some carbon amounts (12-25 wt.) in all the ZnS/MMT nanocomposites, which come from CTAB used during the deposition of ZnS nanoparticles and is intercalated in the MMT interlayer and thus increases the d 001 distance of MMT.This feature also pretty correlates with the decreasing specific surface area of investigated nanocomposites in the order 2.0 wt. ZnS/MMT 3.1 wt. ZnS/MMT 4.2 wt. ZnS/MMT as a consequence of increasing carbon amounts 12, 19.4 and 25 wt., respectively.However, from Table 2 and Fig. 3 is evident that the change in the inter-planar distance d 001 of MMT at 3.1 wt. and 4.2 wt. ZnS loadings is not so substantial despite the significantly increased carbon amount (19.4 and 25 wt., respectively).It reveals that at 4.2 wt. of deposited ZnS the effect of CTAB intercalation to the MMT interlayer is comparable to that for 3.1 wt. of ZnS and thus the significantly decreased specific surface area of 4.2 wt. ZnS/MMT nanocomposite (0.9 m 2 /g) can be caused by plugging of MMT mesopores and macropores by additional CTAB as well as ZnS nanoparticles or their agglomerates, e.g. in the pore mouths.The observations from XRD pretty support the observations from nitrogen physisorption. The position of the 0 0 1 diffraction peak in MMT and corresponding inter-planar distances d001 with estimated errors.Arising from previous knowledge about possible agglomeration of ZnS nanoparticles stabilized by CTAB 52 and in order to support hypotheses about plugging of MMT porous structure also by ZnS nanoparticles/agglomerates, the TEM analysis of ZnS/MMT nanocomposites was performed as well.The TEM micrographs showing ZnS agglomerates of different sizes deposited on the external surface of MMT are shown in Fig. 4a andb.A detailed view of one ZnS agglomerate revealed that the agglomerates were composed of individual ZnS nanoparticles with sizes of about 20-40 nm.It is in contrast with determined gap energies (see below) corresponding to sizes equal and smaller than 10 nm when the quantum size effect occurs.This apparent disagreement indicates that ZnS nanoparticles of different sizes as well as agglomerated in large agglomerates with sizes of several hundred nanometers exist on MMT.Formation of agglomerates is key for understanding different photocatalytic efficiency discussed below. Since the same ZnS suspension was used for the preparation of all ZnS/MMT nanocomposites, the size of ZnS nanoparticles does not determine the differences between them.As reported in our previous study 28, ZnS nanoparticles and CTAB form agglomerates attached. The mean size of ZnS nanoparticles was estimated from their optical properties in a suspension, i.e. before they were deposited on MMT.The well described size-dependence of absorption spectra was considered and the effective mass approximation was utilized to obtain the size of ZnS nanoparticles from the following Brus equation 53: where E bg (bulk) and E bg (nano) are the band bap energies of bulk and nano-sized semiconductors, respectively, h is the Planck' constant, m e and m h are the effective masses of electron and hole, respectively, and is the dielectric constant of the material.Here, m e 0.42 m 0 and m h 0.61 m 0 , where m 0 is the free electron mass and the dielectric constant e 8.76 54.The band gap energy of ZnS nanoparticles was estimated from the linear part of the (h ) 0.5 versus (h ) plot as described in our previous work 28.Fig. 5 shows the UV-vis spectra of ZnS/MMT nanocomposites.The band gap energy of ZnS/MMT with 2.0 wt. of ZnS was 3.65 eV (Table 1).This value is close to that band gap energy reported for bulk ZnS (3.6-3.7 eV) 55.The band gap energy of ZnS/MMT increased with increasing concentration of ZnS up to 3.84 eV for 4.2 wt. ZnS/MMT.Previously, it has been reported that the increase in band gap energy is a result of reduction in the particle size of ZnS that is related to the quantum confinement effects 565758 a vacuum, is the dielectric constant for the ZnS (8.76), h is the Planck constant and e is the charge of an electron.Diameter (2R) of studied materials has been estimated to be 10.0 nm, 7.2 nm and 5.7 nm for ZnS/MMT with 2.0 wt., 3.1 wt. and 4.2 wt. of ZnS.The absolute values of ZnS particles calculated from UV-vis are affected by used E 0 value that has been reported to be 3.6-3.7 eV and the dielectric constant for the ZnS.This is probably a reason, why the absolute value of ZnS particles calculated from UV-vis is lower than those values determined from TEM.Nevertheless, it brings attractive connection between TEM and UV-vis results.It is surprising that the particle diameter of ZnS calculated from the band gap energy (Table 1) decreases with increasing ZnS loading.Moreover, it is in contrast to TEM results.This effect can be explained by clustering of ZnS particles with approximately of the same nano-size.While 2.0 wt. ZnS/MMT contains separated ZnS nanoparticles with approximately the same diameter of 20-40 nm (TEM-Fig.4a), 4.2 wt. ZnS/MMT contains both ZnS nanoparticles and ZnS agglomerates of micrometer-size composed of many of ZnS nanoparticles (TEM-Fig.4b).Based on that fact the decrease in the band gap energy can be associated with the dominant effect of the presence of higher amount of ZnS nanoparticles and lower amount of ZnS agglomerates. ZnS/MMT nanocomposites with different contents of ZnS were investigated for the photoreduction of CO 2 dissolved in NaOH solutions.The commercial TiO 2 Evonic P25 photocatalyst was examined as a reference for comparison.The effect of irradiation time on the formation of products was investigated over a period of 0-24 h.Fig. 6 shows the evolution of all reaction products as the functions of the irradiation for the 3.1 wt. ZnS/MMT nanocomposite.The main gaseous product was methane.Hydrogen and low amounts of carbon monoxide were also detected.Other products such as formic acid, formaldehyde, ethane and ethylene could also be formed 22,59, but they were undetectable in our GC configuration.The observed yields (mol/g cat ) order was: H 2 CH 4 CO. Comparisons of CH 4 , H 2 and CO yields over ZnS/MMT with different contents of ZnS are shown in Fig. 7a-c, respectively.A gradual increase of methane yield was observed after the start of irradiation with the exception of commercial TiO 2 catalyst.In this case the yields of methane were negligible during the first 8 h of irradiation.The highest yield of methane was observed for 3.1 wt. ZnS/MMT. In case of ZnS/MMT, the hydrogen yields continually increased during the whole experiments.In comparison with the application of commercial titanium dioxide, hydrogen was produced in 6-fold higher concentrations (Fig. 7b).The yields of carbon monoxide were increasing slowly during the reaction, but all yields were close to the limit of detection (Fig. 7c).The highest yield of both products was observed for 3.1 wt. ZnS/MMT. The data from the longest reaction time span were chosen for the overall comparison because the yields of all products were the highest and the most accurate.The results show that the photocatalytic performance of nanocomposites varies with the content of ZnS in the order of 3.1 wt. ZnS 4.2 wt. ZnS 2.0 wt. ZnS.All yields of products for ZnS/MMT nanocomposites were higher than those for the commercial photocatalyst Evonic P25.According to the blank test, the original montmorillonite does not possess any photocatalytic performance. Regarding the possible formation of reaction products in a consequence of some carbon content from CTAB presented, it is worth to mention that the formation of methane was already investigated with the developed type of nanocomposite within the blank experiments at various pH in our previous study 60.The generation of methane was observed, the effect of different pH on the methane yields was comparable.However, in our study the evolution of photocatalytic performance of ZnS/MMT nanocomposites does not follow the trend in increasing carbon content (within increasing ZnS loading), thus the determined trend in photocatalytic performance can be considered as not burdened with this fact and correct. One would assume that with increasing loading of ZnS nanoparticles, which is the only active component in the ZnS/MMT nanocomposites, the photocatalytic performance of investigated nanocomposites would escalate.However, this hypothesis was not confirmed.According to the blank test, the original montmorillonite does not possess any photocatalytic performance.Besides that, 4.2 wt. of ZnS on MMT does not assign the highest photocatalytic performance.The overall order of photocatalytic performance in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 was following: 3.1 wt. ZnS 4.2 wt. ZnS 2.0 wt. ZnS.It is evident that with higher content of ZnS the nanocomposite photocatalytic performance in the first instance increases, but then there is a decline.This indicates that probably besides the ZnS loading, also the degree of agglomeration of ZnS nanoparticles plays a key role.The agglomeration of ZnS nanoparticles increases with increasing ZnS loading as it is evident from the results of TEM and UV-vis and it could be correlated with the work function as follows.The work function is the minimum energy that must be given to an electron to liberate it from the surface of ZnS nanoparticle.If ZnS occurs on MMT as same-size nanoparticles in various ZnS loadings, the work function should be same.We suppose, if such ZnS nanoparticles agglomerate and the degree of their agglomeration is too high, the work function should be higher.In our case with increasing ZnS loading the nanoparticles agglomerate and the lowest work function is achieved for 3.1 wt. of ZnS in MMT, when ZnS is partially as separated nanoparticles and partially as agglomerates.This evidences the correlation between the degree of ZnS nanoparticles agglomeration and the work function.Fig. 8 shows the correlation between the yields of methane after 24 h of irradiation and the work function of each catalyst.It can be seen from Fig. 8 that the lowest electron work function corresponds to the most active catalyst.This observation is in agreement with our previous observations over cerium doped TiO 2 nanoparticulated photocatalysts in the same reaction 61 and corresponds to the reaction mechanism.The photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide is conducted via generated electrons and the 3.1 wt. ZnS/MMT nanocomposite releases those electrons most easily.Contrary to that, pristine montmorillonite shows no photocatalytic performance, corresponding nicely to very high electron work function. The valence band of sulfide semiconductors, made of 3p orbitals of the sulfur atoms, is shifted upwards compared with those of the oxide analogues, while the conduction band electrons are also more reductive 62.For the CO 2 photocatalytic reduction the electron energy in conduction band must be higher than H reduction potential and the hole energy in valence band must be lower than OH -oxidation potentials.ZnS is a direct wide band gap semiconductor (Eg 3.6 eV in the bulk) 63, hence it absorbs only in the UV range, but it possesses a strongly reducing conduction band (E CB -1.85V versus the NHE at pH 7) 64.The addition of ZnS to MMT should result in changing the band gap and the absorption edge energies can be expected and was also experimentally demonstrated (see Fig. 5).However, it is always difficult to predict separately the shift of conduction and valence band energies, which are extremely important with respect to required oxidation and reduction potentials. The work function for different ZnS contents shown in Fig. 8 can help us to elucidate the shifts of conduction as well as valence bands.For simplicity the Fermi level on nanoparticle surface is supposed to be pinned to the middle of the nanoparticle band gap.Deriving from Figs. 5 and8 and Table 1, we can estimate that the energy of electrons on the conduction band edge is -2.066 eV, while the valence band edge is -5.716 eV for 2.0 wt. ZnS/MMT (Fig. 9a).For 3.1 wt. ZnS/MMT the energy of electrons on the conduction band edge increases about approximately 134 meV, while the valence band edge shifts up by 54 meV.Further increase of ZnS content up to 4.2 wt. led only to a much smaller conduction band decrease (21 meV), whereas the valence band edge shifts down by 89 meV.These shifts are depicted in Fig. 9b.Higher levels of the conduction band are more effective for the creation of H ions which are necessary for CO 2 reduction.It can be concluded that for 3.1 wt. of ZnS the carriers have the most suitable potentials for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 . In summary: Since the optical and electronic properties of nanocomposites have been considered as key properties related to the mechanism of CO 2 photocatalytic reduction and there exist the correlation between the band gap energy, the nanoparticle work function and the degree of agglomeration of nanoparticles, the behavior of ZnS on nano-size level plays the determining role.The shift in conduction band and valence band energies of ZnS at different ZnS loadings is a consequence of different degree of ZnS nanoparticles agglomeration on MMT. ZnS nanoparticles stabilized by cetyltrimethylammonium bromide were deposited on montmorillonite (MMT) forming the ZnS/MMT nanocomposites with ZnS loadings within 2.0-4.2wt..The key role in the performance of ZnS/MMT nanocomposites in the CO 2 photocatalytic reduction played the energies of electrons and holes within the electronic structure of designed photocatalytic materials, which were in fact affected by ZnS loadings.The potentials of electrons and holes required for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 were the most suitable for the 3.1 wt. ZnS/MMT nanocomposite.All prepared ZnS/MMT nanocomposites exhibited higher efficiency in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction in comparison with the commercial TiO 2 Evonic P25.

ZnS/MMT.The second variation, the ratio of ZnS suspension volume to MMT weight was varied from 1:2 (L:g) to 1:4 and 1:8, resulting in nanocomposites denoted as 3.1 wt. ZnS/MMT and 2.0 wt. ZnS/MMT. The content of ZnS in ZnS/MMT nanocomposites was determined by elemental analysis of sulphur performed by a combustion analyser ELTRA (Eltra, Germany) and determination of zinc after their dissolution in a mixture of HF, HNO 3 and HClO 4 41 by an atomic absorption spectrometer AA280FS (Varian Inc., Austria). The nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurements at 77 K were performed using the volumetric apparatus Nova2000e (Quntachrome, USA).Prior to the nitrogen physisorption measurements, the samples were degassed at 105 C for 4 h under vacuum less than 1 Pa.Degassing at temperature of 105 C was applied in order to remove physisorbed water, however, with no influence on the textural or structural properties of investigated nanocomposites.The specific surface area, S BET , was calculated according to the classical Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) theory for the relative pressure range p/p 0 0.05-0.3042.Since the specific surface area, S BET , is not such a proper parameter in the case of mesoporous solids containing some micropores 42,43, the mesopore surface area, S meso , and the micropore volume, V micro , were additionally also evaluated based on the t-plot method 44, using DeBoer standard isotherm.The net pore volume, V net , was determined from the nitrogen adsorption isotherm at maximum p/p 0 (0.991).The mesoporesize distribution (pore diameter 3-130 nm) was evaluated from the adsorption branch of the nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm by the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method 45, using the DeBoer standard isotherm and the assumption of the cylindrical pore geometry. The X-ray diffraction powder (XRD) patterns were measured by a standard laboratory diffractometer in the conventional focusing Bragg-Brentano geometry with variable slits (Ni-filtered Cu K, 1.4 kW).A linear detector was used to collect the scattered intensity. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations were carried out on a JEOL 2010F microscope operated at 200 kV (LaB6 cathode, resolution 0.19 nm) using carbon coated copper grid. UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of prepared samples (grain size 0.160 mm) were measured by using a GBS CINTRA 303 spectrometer equipped with a Spectralon-coated integrating sphere using a Spectralon coated discs as a standard.The spectra were recorded in the range of the wavelength 200-800 nm (lamps switched at 350 nm).The reflectances were re-calculated to the absorption using the Schuster-Kubelka-Munk equation, where R is the diffuse reflectance from a semi-infinite layer.The obtained spectra were transformed to the dependencies (F(R )h ) 2 against h and assuming that the Tauc's law 46,47 can be expressed as: , where the Eg is the energy of absorption edge values (determined from obtained plots), h is the Planck constant and is the light frequency.Kubelka-Munk function was used to estimate the band gap energy of prepared photocatalysts.The optical absorption threshold (lg) was calculated using the equation, lg 1240/EB, where EB is the band gap energy. The contact potential difference (V CPD ) measurements were carried out by the dynamic condenser method of Kelvin with a KP6500 probe (McAllister Technical Services).The reference electrode was a standard stainless steel plate with diameter of 3 mm ( r ef 4.3 eV) provided by the manufacturer.During the measurements the gradient of the peak-to-peak versus backing potential was set to 0.2, whereas the vibration frequency and amplitude was set to 120 Hz and 40 a.u.The final V CPD value was an average of 60 independent points using two backing potentials.The measurements were carried out under atmospheric pressure and ambient temperature.Before measurements the samples were pressed into pellets of 10 mm diameter using the 8 MPa pressure.The work function values were obtained from a simple relation V CPD ref - sample . The photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide was carried out in a stirred batch annular reactor with a suspended catalyst illuminated by the UV 8 W Hg-lamp (254 nm).The CO 2 diffusion from the gas phase through the gas-liquid interface in a laboratory batch slurry reactor was eliminated by saturating the aqueous solutions of 0.2 mmol/L NaOH with pure CO 2 before the beginning of reactions.During this step, pH decreased from 11.8 to 6.6.The catalyst loading of 1 g/L was chosen to avoid the concentration gradients in a bulk of stirred liquid with the dispersion due to a scattering effect of light as a result of the high nanocomposite concentration.A suitable volume of 100 mL of the liquid phase was used to ensure the perfect mixing in this photoreactor 48.CO 2 reduction products, such as hydrogen, methane and carbon monoxide, were analysed by a gas chromatograph (GC-Agilent Technologies 6890N) equipped with FID and TCD detectors (GC/FID/TCD) and the Molsieve and HP Poraplot Q columns.The calibration with certified calibration gases (0.05 mol.CH 4 , 0.987 mol.H 2 , 2.02 mol.CO, and 99.999 mol.CO 2 ) was performed before each experimental run. Concerning the chemical composition of nanocomposites, the elemental analysis and atomic absorption spectroscopy confirmed that investigated ZnS/MMT nanocomposites contained 4.2 wt., 3.1 wt. and 2.0 wt. of ZnS.In frame of these analyses some content of carbon in individual nanocomposites was also determined as follows: 25.0 wt., 19.4 wt. and 12.0 wt..The source of carbon was the stabilizing cationic surfactant CTAB. With respect to potential application of developed ZnS/MMT nanocomposites in liquid systems, their stability was explored in our previous works 49,50, via their shaking in water for 24 h.The dispersions were filtered and the UV-vis absorption spectra of filtrates were recorded.There was not detected any typical absorption edge of ZnS nanoparticles at about 320 nm in absorption spectra which means that the ZnS nanoparticles were firmly attached to MMT likely located in its pores 49.The stability of ZnS/MMT nanocomposites was also confirmed by the derived mathematical model 50. Fig. 1a and b shows measured nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms and evaluated pore-size distributions of investigated ZnS/MMT nanocomposites.Textural properties are summarized in Table 1.The shapes of nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms of all ZnS/MMT nanocomposites correspond to porous materials possessing dominantly larger mesopores/macropores.In addition to that, it is evident from Fig. 1a that pristine MMT possesses besides large mesopores/macropores also a small portion of micropores (pores with diameter 2 nm, V micro 2 mm 3 liq /g).According to previous research 51, the missing smallest pores in all ZnS/MMT nanocomposites and decreasing nanocomposite specific surface area can be attributed to a plugging of some part of the MMT porous structure, evidently of micropores and smaller mesopores, by CTAB which was used for ZnS/MMT nanocomposites synthesis and whose presence was proved by the determined carbon content by using AAS and elemental analysis.It was reported that the specific surface area of MMT can diminish due to the plugging of MMT porous structure by CTAB up to 4.4 m 2 /g 51.This indicates that further strongly decreased specific surface area of the 4.2 wt. ZnS/MMT nanocomposite (0.9 m 2 /g) may be a result of the secondary effect-incorporation of ZnS nanoparticles and/or ZnS agglomerates to MMT meso-macroporous structure.This phenomenon corresponds to Fig. 1b where pores with diameter 13 nm are evidently disappearing with increasing loading of ZnS nanoparticles from 3.1 to 4.2 wt.. The XRD measurements were performed in order to reveal the crystal structure of ZnS nanoparticles and to determine the inter-planar distance of 0 0 1 planes (d 001 ) of MMT.The diffraction patterns for all the samples including pristine MMT are displayed in Fig. 2a.While the presence of crystalline quartz (trigonal SiO 2 , space group P3 2 21) can be clearly seen, ZnS in any common crystalline form (sphalerite-cubic, F4; -3m; wurtzite-hexagonal, P6 3 mc) cannot be proved.This observation might be caused either by very small ZnS crystallite size or due to small amounts of ZnS nanoparticles (2-4.2 wt.) in the ZnS/MMT nanocomposites since possible ZnS peaks may coincide with those coming from MMT or quartz. The diffraction maxima corresponding to d 001 planes in MMT are displayed in detail in Fig. 2b for all the samples.A shift of the 0 0 1 diffraction peaks corresponding to an increase of the inter-planar distance d 001 with increasing concentration of ZnS can be observed (Table 2).This effect can be explained by the presence of some carbon amounts (12-25 wt.) in all the ZnS/MMT nanocomposites, which come from CTAB used during the deposition of ZnS nanoparticles and is intercalated in the MMT interlayer and thus increases the d 001 distance of MMT.This feature also pretty correlates with the decreasing specific surface area of investigated nanocomposites in the order 2.0 wt. ZnS/MMT 3.1 wt. ZnS/MMT 4.2 wt. ZnS/MMT as a consequence of increasing carbon amounts 12, 19.4 and 25 wt., respectively.However, from Table 2 and Fig. 3 is evident that the change in the inter-planar distance d 001 of MMT at 3.1 wt. and 4.2 wt. ZnS loadings is not so substantial despite the significantly increased carbon amount (19.4 and 25 wt., respectively).It reveals that at 4.2 wt. of deposited ZnS the effect of CTAB intercalation to the MMT interlayer is comparable to that for 3.1 wt. of ZnS and thus the significantly decreased specific surface area of 4.2 wt. ZnS/MMT nanocomposite (0.9 m 2 /g) can be caused by plugging of MMT mesopores and macropores by additional CTAB as well as ZnS nanoparticles or their agglomerates, e.g. in the pore mouths.The observations from XRD pretty support the observations from nitrogen physisorption. The position of the 0 0 1 diffraction peak in MMT and corresponding inter-planar distances d001 with estimated errors.Arising from previous knowledge about possible agglomeration of ZnS nanoparticles stabilized by CTAB 52 and in order to support hypotheses about plugging of MMT porous structure also by ZnS nanoparticles/agglomerates, the TEM analysis of ZnS/MMT nanocomposites was performed as well.The TEM micrographs showing ZnS agglomerates of different sizes deposited on the external surface of MMT are shown in Fig. 4a andb.A detailed view of one ZnS agglomerate revealed that the agglomerates were composed of individual ZnS nanoparticles with sizes of about 20-40 nm.It is in contrast with determined gap energies (see below) corresponding to sizes equal and smaller than 10 nm when the quantum size effect occurs.This apparent disagreement indicates that ZnS nanoparticles of different sizes as well as agglomerated in large agglomerates with sizes of several hundred nanometers exist on MMT.Formation of agglomerates is key for understanding different photocatalytic efficiency discussed below. Since the same ZnS suspension was used for the preparation of all ZnS/MMT nanocomposites, the size of ZnS nanoparticles does not determine the differences between them.As reported in our previous study 28, ZnS nanoparticles and CTAB form agglomerates attached. The mean size of ZnS nanoparticles was estimated from their optical properties in a suspension, i.e. before they were deposited on MMT.The well described size-dependence of absorption spectra was considered and the effective mass approximation was utilized to obtain the size of ZnS nanoparticles from the following Brus equation 53: where E bg (bulk) and E bg (nano) are the band bap energies of bulk and nano-sized semiconductors, respectively, h is the Planck' constant, m e and m h are the effective masses of electron and hole, respectively, and is the dielectric constant of the material.Here, m e 0.42 m 0 and m h 0.61 m 0 , where m 0 is the free electron mass and the dielectric constant e 8.76 54.The band gap energy of ZnS nanoparticles was estimated from the linear part of the (h ) 0.5 versus (h ) plot as described in our previous work 28.Fig. 5 shows the UV-vis spectra of ZnS/MMT nanocomposites.The band gap energy of ZnS/MMT with 2.0 wt. of ZnS was 3.65 eV (Table 1).This value is close to that band gap energy reported for bulk ZnS (3.6-3.7 eV) 55.The band gap energy of ZnS/MMT increased with increasing concentration of ZnS up to 3.84 eV for 4.2 wt. ZnS/MMT.Previously, it has been reported that the increase in band gap energy is a result of reduction in the particle size of ZnS that is related to the quantum confinement effects 565758 a vacuum, is the dielectric constant for the ZnS (8.76), h is the Planck constant and e is the charge of an electron.Diameter (2R) of studied materials has been estimated to be 10.0 nm, 7.2 nm and 5.7 nm for ZnS/MMT with 2.0 wt., 3.1 wt. and 4.2 wt. of ZnS.The absolute values of ZnS particles calculated from UV-vis are affected by used E 0 value that has been reported to be 3.6-3.7 eV and the dielectric constant for the ZnS.This is probably a reason, why the absolute value of ZnS particles calculated from UV-vis is lower than those values determined from TEM.Nevertheless, it brings attractive connection between TEM and UV-vis results.It is surprising that the particle diameter of ZnS calculated from the band gap energy (Table 1) decreases with increasing ZnS loading.Moreover, it is in contrast to TEM results.This effect can be explained by clustering of ZnS particles with approximately of the same nano-size.While 2.0 wt. ZnS/MMT contains separated ZnS nanoparticles with approximately the same diameter of 20-40 nm (TEM-Fig.4a), 4.2 wt. ZnS/MMT contains both ZnS nanoparticles and ZnS agglomerates of micrometer-size composed of many of ZnS nanoparticles (TEM-Fig.4b).Based on that fact the decrease in the band gap energy can be associated with the dominant effect of the presence of higher amount of ZnS nanoparticles and lower amount of ZnS agglomerates. ZnS/MMT nanocomposites with different contents of ZnS were investigated for the photoreduction of CO 2 dissolved in NaOH solutions.The commercial TiO 2 Evonic P25 photocatalyst was examined as a reference for comparison.The effect of irradiation time on the formation of products was investigated over a period of 0-24 h.Fig. 6 shows the evolution of all reaction products as the functions of the irradiation for the 3.1 wt. ZnS/MMT nanocomposite.The main gaseous product was methane.Hydrogen and low amounts of carbon monoxide were also detected.Other products such as formic acid, formaldehyde, ethane and ethylene could also be formed 22,59, but they were undetectable in our GC configuration.The observed yields (mol/g cat ) order was: H 2 CH 4 CO. Comparisons of CH 4 , H 2 and CO yields over ZnS/MMT with different contents of ZnS are shown in Fig. 7a-c, respectively.A gradual increase of methane yield was observed after the start of irradiation with the exception of commercial TiO 2 catalyst.In this case the yields of methane were negligible during the first 8 h of irradiation.The highest yield of methane was observed for 3.1 wt. ZnS/MMT. In case of ZnS/MMT, the hydrogen yields continually increased during the whole experiments.In comparison with the application of commercial titanium dioxide, hydrogen was produced in 6-fold higher concentrations (Fig. 7b).The yields of carbon monoxide were increasing slowly during the reaction, but all yields were close to the limit of detection (Fig. 7c).The highest yield of both products was observed for 3.1 wt. ZnS/MMT. The data from the longest reaction time span were chosen for the overall comparison because the yields of all products were the highest and the most accurate.The results show that the photocatalytic performance of nanocomposites varies with the content of ZnS in the order of 3.1 wt. ZnS 4.2 wt. ZnS 2.0 wt. ZnS.All yields of products for ZnS/MMT nanocomposites were higher than those for the commercial photocatalyst Evonic P25.According to the blank test, the original montmorillonite does not possess any photocatalytic performance. Regarding the possible formation of reaction products in a consequence of some carbon content from CTAB presented, it is worth to mention that the formation of methane was already investigated with the developed type of nanocomposite within the blank experiments at various pH in our previous study 60.The generation of methane was observed, the effect of different pH on the methane yields was comparable.However, in our study the evolution of photocatalytic performance of ZnS/MMT nanocomposites does not follow the trend in increasing carbon content (within increasing ZnS loading), thus the determined trend in photocatalytic performance can be considered as not burdened with this fact and correct. One would assume that with increasing loading of ZnS nanoparticles, which is the only active component in the ZnS/MMT nanocomposites, the photocatalytic performance of investigated nanocomposites would escalate.However, this hypothesis was not confirmed.According to the blank test, the original montmorillonite does not possess any photocatalytic performance.Besides that, 4.2 wt. of ZnS on MMT does not assign the highest photocatalytic performance.The overall order of photocatalytic performance in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 was following: 3.1 wt. ZnS 4.2 wt. ZnS 2.0 wt. ZnS.It is evident that with higher content of ZnS the nanocomposite photocatalytic performance in the first instance increases, but then there is a decline.This indicates that probably besides the ZnS loading, also the degree of agglomeration of ZnS nanoparticles plays a key role.The agglomeration of ZnS nanoparticles increases with increasing ZnS loading as it is evident from the results of TEM and UV-vis and it could be correlated with the work function as follows.The work function is the minimum energy that must be given to an electron to liberate it from the surface of ZnS nanoparticle.If ZnS occurs on MMT as same-size nanoparticles in various ZnS loadings, the work function should be same.We suppose, if such ZnS nanoparticles agglomerate and the degree of their agglomeration is too high, the work function should be higher.In our case with increasing ZnS loading the nanoparticles agglomerate and the lowest work function is achieved for 3.1 wt. of ZnS in MMT, when ZnS is partially as separated nanoparticles and partially as agglomerates.This evidences the correlation between the degree of ZnS nanoparticles agglomeration and the work function.Fig. 8 shows the correlation between the yields of methane after 24 h of irradiation and the work function of each catalyst.It can be seen from Fig. 8 that the lowest electron work function corresponds to the most active catalyst.This observation is in agreement with our previous observations over cerium doped TiO 2 nanoparticulated photocatalysts in the same reaction 61 and corresponds to the reaction mechanism.The photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide is conducted via generated electrons and the 3.1 wt. ZnS/MMT nanocomposite releases those electrons most easily.Contrary to that, pristine montmorillonite shows no photocatalytic performance, corresponding nicely to very high electron work function. The valence band of sulfide semiconductors, made of 3p orbitals of the sulfur atoms, is shifted upwards compared with those of the oxide analogues, while the conduction band electrons are also more reductive 62.For the CO 2 photocatalytic reduction the electron energy in conduction band must be higher than H reduction potential and the hole energy in valence band must be lower than OH -oxidation potentials.ZnS is a direct wide band gap semiconductor (Eg 3.6 eV in the bulk) 63, hence it absorbs only in the UV range, but it possesses a strongly reducing conduction band (E CB -1.85V versus the NHE at pH 7) 64.The addition of ZnS to MMT should result in changing the band gap and the absorption edge energies can be expected and was also experimentally demonstrated (see Fig. 5).However, it is always difficult to predict separately the shift of conduction and valence band energies, which are extremely important with respect to required oxidation and reduction potentials. The work function for different ZnS contents shown in Fig. 8 can help us to elucidate the shifts of conduction as well as valence bands.For simplicity the Fermi level on nanoparticle surface is supposed to be pinned to the middle of the nanoparticle band gap.Deriving from Figs. 5 and8 and Table 1, we can estimate that the energy of electrons on the conduction band edge is -2.066 eV, while the valence band edge is -5.716 eV for 2.0 wt. ZnS/MMT (Fig. 9a).For 3.1 wt. ZnS/MMT the energy of electrons on the conduction band edge increases about approximately 134 meV, while the valence band edge shifts up by 54 meV.Further increase of ZnS content up to 4.2 wt. led only to a much smaller conduction band decrease (21 meV), whereas the valence band edge shifts down by 89 meV.These shifts are depicted in Fig. 9b.Higher levels of the conduction band are more effective for the creation of H ions which are necessary for CO 2 reduction.It can be concluded that for 3.1 wt. of ZnS the carriers have the most suitable potentials for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 . In summary: Since the optical and electronic properties of nanocomposites have been considered as key properties related to the mechanism of CO 2 photocatalytic reduction and there exist the correlation between the band gap energy, the nanoparticle work function and the degree of agglomeration of nanoparticles, the behavior of ZnS on nano-size level plays the determining role.The shift in conduction band and valence band energies of ZnS at different ZnS loadings is a consequence of different degree of ZnS nanoparticles agglomeration on MMT.

Fig. 1a and b shows measured nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms and evaluated pore-size distributions of investigated ZnS/MMT nanocomposites.Textural properties are summarized in Table 1.The shapes of nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms of all ZnS/MMT nanocomposites correspond to porous materials possessing dominantly larger mesopores/macropores.In addition to that, it is evident from Fig. 1a that pristine MMT possesses besides large mesopores/macropores also a small portion of micropores (pores with diameter 2 nm, V micro 2 mm 3 liq /g).According to previous research 51, the missing smallest pores in all ZnS/MMT nanocomposites and decreasing nanocomposite specific surface area can be attributed to a plugging of some part of the MMT porous structure, evidently of micropores and smaller mesopores, by CTAB which was used for ZnS/MMT nanocomposites synthesis and whose presence was proved by the determined carbon content by using AAS and elemental analysis.It was reported that the specific surface area of MMT can diminish due to the plugging of MMT porous structure by CTAB up to 4.4 m 2 /g 51.This indicates that further strongly decreased specific surface area of the 4.2 wt.

The XRD measurements were performed in order to reveal the crystal structure of ZnS nanoparticles and to determine the inter-planar distance of 0 0 1 planes (d 001 ) of MMT.The diffraction patterns for all the samples including pristine MMT are displayed in Fig. 2a.While the presence of crystalline quartz (trigonal SiO 2 , space group P3 2 21) can be clearly seen, ZnS in any common crystalline form (sphalerite-cubic, F4; -3m; wurtzite-hexagonal, P6 3 mc) cannot be proved.This observation might be caused either by very small ZnS crystallite size or due to small amounts of ZnS nanoparticles (2-4.2 wt.) in the ZnS/MMT nanocomposites since possible ZnS peaks may coincide with those coming from MMT or quartz. The diffraction maxima corresponding to d 001 planes in MMT are displayed in detail in Fig. 2b for all the samples.A shift of the 0 0 1 diffraction peaks corresponding to an increase of the inter-planar distance d 001 with increasing concentration of ZnS can be observed (Table 2).This effect can be explained by the presence of some carbon amounts (12-25 wt.) in all the ZnS/MMT nanocomposites, which come from CTAB used during the deposition of ZnS nanoparticles and is intercalated in the MMT interlayer and thus increases the d 001 distance of MMT.This feature also pretty correlates with the decreasing specific surface area of investigated nanocomposites in the order 2.0 wt. ZnS/MMT 3.1 wt. ZnS/MMT 4.2 wt. ZnS/MMT as a consequence of increasing carbon amounts 12, 19.4 and 25 wt., respectively.However, from Table 2 and Fig. 3 is evident that the change in the inter-planar distance d 001 of MMT at 3.1 wt. and 4.2 wt. ZnS loadings is not so substantial despite the significantly increased carbon amount (19.4 and 25 wt., respectively).It reveals that at 4.2 wt. of deposited ZnS the effect of CTAB intercalation to the MMT interlayer is comparable to that for 3.1 wt. of ZnS and thus the significantly decreased specific surface area of 4.2 wt. ZnS/MMT nanocomposite (0.9 m 2 /g) can be caused by plugging of MMT mesopores and macropores by additional CTAB as well as ZnS nanoparticles or their agglomerates, e.g. in the pore mouths.The observations from XRD pretty support the observations from nitrogen physisorption. The position of the 0 0 1 diffraction peak in MMT and corresponding inter-planar distances d001 with estimated errors.Arising from previous knowledge about possible agglomeration of ZnS nanoparticles stabilized by CTAB 52 and in order to support hypotheses about plugging of MMT porous structure also by ZnS nanoparticles/agglomerates, the TEM analysis of ZnS/MMT nanocomposites was performed as well.The TEM micrographs showing ZnS agglomerates of different sizes deposited on the external surface of MMT are shown in Fig. 4a andb.A detailed view of one ZnS agglomerate revealed that the agglomerates were composed of individual ZnS nanoparticles with sizes of about 20-40 nm.It is in contrast with determined gap energies (see below) corresponding to sizes equal and smaller than 10 nm when the quantum size effect occurs.This apparent disagreement indicates that ZnS nanoparticles of different sizes as well as agglomerated in large agglomerates with sizes of several hundred nanometers exist on MMT.Formation of agglomerates is key for understanding different photocatalytic efficiency discussed below. Since the same ZnS suspension was used for the preparation of all ZnS/MMT nanocomposites, the size of ZnS nanoparticles does not determine the differences between them.As reported in our previous study 28, ZnS nanoparticles and CTAB form agglomerates attached. The mean size of ZnS nanoparticles was estimated from their optical properties in a suspension, i.e. before they were deposited on MMT.The well described size-dependence of absorption spectra was considered and the effective mass approximation was utilized to obtain the size of ZnS nanoparticles from the following Brus equation 53: where E bg (bulk) and E bg (nano) are the band bap energies of bulk and nano-sized semiconductors, respectively, h is the Planck' constant, m e and m h are the effective masses of electron and hole, respectively, and is the dielectric constant of the material.Here, m e 0.42 m 0 and m h 0.61 m 0 , where m 0 is the free electron mass and the dielectric constant e 8.76 54.The band gap energy of ZnS nanoparticles was estimated from the linear part of the (h ) 0.5 versus (h ) plot as described in our previous work 28.Fig. 5 shows the UV-vis spectra of ZnS/MMT nanocomposites.The band gap energy of ZnS/MMT with 2.0 wt. of ZnS was 3.65 eV (Table 1).This value is close to that band gap energy reported for bulk ZnS (3.6-3.7 eV) 55.The band gap energy of ZnS/MMT increased with increasing concentration of ZnS up to 3.84 eV for 4.2 wt. ZnS/MMT.Previously, it has been reported that the increase in band gap energy is a result of reduction in the particle size of ZnS that is related to the quantum confinement effects 565758 a vacuum, is the dielectric constant for the ZnS (8.76), h is the Planck constant and e is the charge of an electron.Diameter (2R) of studied materials has been estimated to be 10.0 nm, 7.2 nm and 5.7 nm for ZnS/MMT with 2.0 wt., 3.1 wt. and 4.2 wt. of ZnS.The absolute values of ZnS particles calculated from UV-vis are affected by used E 0 value that has been reported to be 3.6-3.7 eV and the dielectric constant for the ZnS.This is probably a reason, why the absolute value of ZnS particles calculated from UV-vis is lower than those values determined from TEM.Nevertheless, it brings attractive connection between TEM and UV-vis results.It is surprising that the particle diameter of ZnS calculated from the band gap energy (Table 1) decreases with increasing ZnS loading.Moreover, it is in contrast to TEM results.This effect can be explained by clustering of ZnS particles with approximately of the same nano-size.While 2.0 wt. ZnS/MMT contains separated ZnS nanoparticles with approximately the same diameter of 20-40 nm (TEM-Fig.4a), 4.2 wt. ZnS/MMT contains both ZnS nanoparticles and ZnS agglomerates of micrometer-size composed of many of ZnS nanoparticles (TEM-Fig.4b).Based on that fact the decrease in the band gap energy can be associated with the dominant effect of the presence of higher amount of ZnS nanoparticles and lower amount of ZnS agglomerates. ZnS/MMT nanocomposites with different contents of ZnS were investigated for the photoreduction of CO 2 dissolved in NaOH solutions.The commercial TiO 2 Evonic P25 photocatalyst was examined as a reference for comparison.The effect of irradiation time on the formation of products was investigated over a period of 0-24 h.Fig. 6 shows the evolution of all reaction products as the functions of the irradiation for the 3.1 wt. ZnS/MMT nanocomposite.The main gaseous product was methane.Hydrogen and low amounts of carbon monoxide were also detected.Other products such as formic acid, formaldehyde, ethane and ethylene could also be formed 22,59, but they were undetectable in our GC configuration.The observed yields (mol/g cat ) order was: H 2 CH 4 CO. Comparisons of CH 4 , H 2 and CO yields over ZnS/MMT with different contents of ZnS are shown in Fig. 7a-c, respectively.A gradual increase of methane yield was observed after the start of irradiation with the exception of commercial TiO 2 catalyst.In this case the yields of methane were negligible during the first 8 h of irradiation.The highest yield of methane was observed for 3.1 wt. ZnS/MMT. In case of ZnS/MMT, the hydrogen yields continually increased during the whole experiments.In comparison with the application of commercial titanium dioxide, hydrogen was produced in 6-fold higher concentrations (Fig. 7b).The yields of carbon monoxide were increasing slowly during the reaction, but all yields were close to the limit of detection (Fig. 7c).The highest yield of both products was observed for 3.1 wt. ZnS/MMT. The data from the longest reaction time span were chosen for the overall comparison because the yields of all products were the highest and the most accurate.The results show that the photocatalytic performance of nanocomposites varies with the content of ZnS in the order of 3.1 wt. ZnS 4.2 wt. ZnS 2.0 wt. ZnS.All yields of products for ZnS/MMT nanocomposites were higher than those for the commercial photocatalyst Evonic P25.According to the blank test, the original montmorillonite does not possess any photocatalytic performance. Regarding the possible formation of reaction products in a consequence of some carbon content from CTAB presented, it is worth to mention that the formation of methane was already investigated with the developed type of nanocomposite within the blank experiments at various pH in our previous study 60.The generation of methane was observed, the effect of different pH on the methane yields was comparable.However, in our study the evolution of photocatalytic performance of ZnS/MMT nanocomposites does not follow the trend in increasing carbon content (within increasing ZnS loading), thus the determined trend in photocatalytic performance can be considered as not burdened with this fact and correct. One would assume that with increasing loading of ZnS nanoparticles, which is the only active component in the ZnS/MMT nanocomposites, the photocatalytic performance of investigated nanocomposites would escalate.However, this hypothesis was not confirmed.According to the blank test, the original montmorillonite does not possess any photocatalytic performance.Besides that, 4.2 wt. of ZnS on MMT does not assign the highest photocatalytic performance.The overall order of photocatalytic performance in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 was following: 3.1 wt. ZnS 4.2 wt. ZnS 2.0 wt. ZnS.It is evident that with higher content of ZnS the nanocomposite photocatalytic performance in the first instance increases, but then there is a decline.This indicates that probably besides the ZnS loading, also the degree of agglomeration of ZnS nanoparticles plays a key role.The agglomeration of ZnS nanoparticles increases with increasing ZnS loading as it is evident from the results of TEM and UV-vis and it could be correlated with the work function as follows.The work function is the minimum energy that must be given to an electron to liberate it from the surface of ZnS nanoparticle.If ZnS occurs on MMT as same-size nanoparticles in various ZnS loadings, the work function should be same.We suppose, if such ZnS nanoparticles agglomerate and the degree of their agglomeration is too high, the work function should be higher.In our case with increasing ZnS loading the nanoparticles agglomerate and the lowest work function is achieved for 3.1 wt. of ZnS in MMT, when ZnS is partially as separated nanoparticles and partially as agglomerates.This evidences the correlation between the degree of ZnS nanoparticles agglomeration and the work function.Fig. 8 shows the correlation between the yields of methane after 24 h of irradiation and the work function of each catalyst.It can be seen from Fig. 8 that the lowest electron work function corresponds to the most active catalyst.This observation is in agreement with our previous observations over cerium doped TiO 2 nanoparticulated photocatalysts in the same reaction 61 and corresponds to the reaction mechanism.The photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide is conducted via generated electrons and the 3.1 wt. ZnS/MMT nanocomposite releases those electrons most easily.Contrary to that, pristine montmorillonite shows no photocatalytic performance, corresponding nicely to very high electron work function. The valence band of sulfide semiconductors, made of 3p orbitals of the sulfur atoms, is shifted upwards compared with those of the oxide analogues, while the conduction band electrons are also more reductive 62.For the CO 2 photocatalytic reduction the electron energy in conduction band must be higher than H reduction potential and the hole energy in valence band must be lower than OH -oxidation potentials.ZnS is a direct wide band gap semiconductor (Eg 3.6 eV in the bulk) 63, hence it absorbs only in the UV range, but it possesses a strongly reducing conduction band (E CB -1.85V versus the NHE at pH 7) 64.The addition of ZnS to MMT should result in changing the band gap and the absorption edge energies can be expected and was also experimentally demonstrated (see Fig. 5).However, it is always difficult to predict separately the shift of conduction and valence band energies, which are extremely important with respect to required oxidation and reduction potentials. The work function for different ZnS contents shown in Fig. 8 can help us to elucidate the shifts of conduction as well as valence bands.For simplicity the Fermi level on nanoparticle surface is supposed to be pinned to the middle of the nanoparticle band gap.Deriving from Figs. 5 and8 and Table 1, we can estimate that the energy of electrons on the conduction band edge is -2.066 eV, while the valence band edge is -5.716 eV for 2.0 wt. ZnS/MMT (Fig. 9a).For 3.1 wt. ZnS/MMT the energy of electrons on the conduction band edge increases about approximately 134 meV, while the valence band edge shifts up by 54 meV.Further increase of ZnS content up to 4.2 wt. led only to a much smaller conduction band decrease (21 meV), whereas the valence band edge shifts down by 89 meV.These shifts are depicted in Fig. 9b.Higher levels of the conduction band are more effective for the creation of H ions which are necessary for CO 2 reduction.It can be concluded that for 3.1 wt. of ZnS the carriers have the most suitable potentials for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 . In summary: Since the optical and electronic properties of nanocomposites have been considered as key properties related to the mechanism of CO 2 photocatalytic reduction and there exist the correlation between the band gap energy, the nanoparticle work function and the degree of agglomeration of nanoparticles, the behavior of ZnS on nano-size level plays the determining role.The shift in conduction band and valence band energies of ZnS at different ZnS loadings is a consequence of different degree of ZnS nanoparticles agglomeration on MMT."}, {"llm generation": "Gas", "source": "The key role in the performance of ZnS/MMT nanocomposites in the CO 2 photocatalytic reduction played the energies of electrons and holes within the electronic structure of designed photocatalytic materials, which were in fact affected by ZnS loadings.", "context": "ZnS nanoparticles stabilized by cetyltrimethylammonium bromide were deposited on montmorillonite (MMT) forming the ZnS/MMT nanocomposites with ZnS loadings within 2.0-4.2wt..The key role in the performance of ZnS/MMT nanocomposites in the CO 2 photocatalytic reduction played the energies of electrons and holes within the electronic structure of designed photocatalytic materials, which were in fact affected by ZnS loadings.The potentials of electrons and holes required for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 were the most suitable for the 3.1 wt.

ZnS/MMT.The second variation, the ratio of ZnS suspension volume to MMT weight was varied from 1:2 (L:g) to 1:4 and 1:8, resulting in nanocomposites denoted as 3.1 wt. ZnS/MMT and 2.0 wt. ZnS/MMT. The content of ZnS in ZnS/MMT nanocomposites was determined by elemental analysis of sulphur performed by a combustion analyser ELTRA (Eltra, Germany) and determination of zinc after their dissolution in a mixture of HF, HNO 3 and HClO 4 41 by an atomic absorption spectrometer AA280FS (Varian Inc., Austria). The nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurements at 77 K were performed using the volumetric apparatus Nova2000e (Quntachrome, USA).Prior to the nitrogen physisorption measurements, the samples were degassed at 105 C for 4 h under vacuum less than 1 Pa.Degassing at temperature of 105 C was applied in order to remove physisorbed water, however, with no influence on the textural or structural properties of investigated nanocomposites.The specific surface area, S BET , was calculated according to the classical Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) theory for the relative pressure range p/p 0 0.05-0.3042.Since the specific surface area, S BET , is not such a proper parameter in the case of mesoporous solids containing some micropores 42,43, the mesopore surface area, S meso , and the micropore volume, V micro , were additionally also evaluated based on the t-plot method 44, using DeBoer standard isotherm.The net pore volume, V net , was determined from the nitrogen adsorption isotherm at maximum p/p 0 (0.991).The mesoporesize distribution (pore diameter 3-130 nm) was evaluated from the adsorption branch of the nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm by the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method 45, using the DeBoer standard isotherm and the assumption of the cylindrical pore geometry. The X-ray diffraction powder (XRD) patterns were measured by a standard laboratory diffractometer in the conventional focusing Bragg-Brentano geometry with variable slits (Ni-filtered Cu K, 1.4 kW).A linear detector was used to collect the scattered intensity. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations were carried out on a JEOL 2010F microscope operated at 200 kV (LaB6 cathode, resolution 0.19 nm) using carbon coated copper grid. UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of prepared samples (grain size 0.160 mm) were measured by using a GBS CINTRA 303 spectrometer equipped with a Spectralon-coated integrating sphere using a Spectralon coated discs as a standard.The spectra were recorded in the range of the wavelength 200-800 nm (lamps switched at 350 nm).The reflectances were re-calculated to the absorption using the Schuster-Kubelka-Munk equation, where R is the diffuse reflectance from a semi-infinite layer.The obtained spectra were transformed to the dependencies (F(R )h ) 2 against h and assuming that the Tauc's law 46,47 can be expressed as: , where the Eg is the energy of absorption edge values (determined from obtained plots), h is the Planck constant and is the light frequency.Kubelka-Munk function was used to estimate the band gap energy of prepared photocatalysts.The optical absorption threshold (lg) was calculated using the equation, lg 1240/EB, where EB is the band gap energy. The contact potential difference (V CPD ) measurements were carried out by the dynamic condenser method of Kelvin with a KP6500 probe (McAllister Technical Services).The reference electrode was a standard stainless steel plate with diameter of 3 mm ( r ef 4.3 eV) provided by the manufacturer.During the measurements the gradient of the peak-to-peak versus backing potential was set to 0.2, whereas the vibration frequency and amplitude was set to 120 Hz and 40 a.u.The final V CPD value was an average of 60 independent points using two backing potentials.The measurements were carried out under atmospheric pressure and ambient temperature.Before measurements the samples were pressed into pellets of 10 mm diameter using the 8 MPa pressure.The work function values were obtained from a simple relation V CPD ref - sample . The photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide was carried out in a stirred batch annular reactor with a suspended catalyst illuminated by the UV 8 W Hg-lamp (254 nm).The CO 2 diffusion from the gas phase through the gas-liquid interface in a laboratory batch slurry reactor was eliminated by saturating the aqueous solutions of 0.2 mmol/L NaOH with pure CO 2 before the beginning of reactions.During this step, pH decreased from 11.8 to 6.6.The catalyst loading of 1 g/L was chosen to avoid the concentration gradients in a bulk of stirred liquid with the dispersion due to a scattering effect of light as a result of the high nanocomposite concentration.A suitable volume of 100 mL of the liquid phase was used to ensure the perfect mixing in this photoreactor 48.CO 2 reduction products, such as hydrogen, methane and carbon monoxide, were analysed by a gas chromatograph (GC-Agilent Technologies 6890N) equipped with FID and TCD detectors (GC/FID/TCD) and the Molsieve and HP Poraplot Q columns.The calibration with certified calibration gases (0.05 mol.CH 4 , 0.987 mol.H 2 , 2.02 mol.CO, and 99.999 mol.CO 2 ) was performed before each experimental run. Concerning the chemical composition of nanocomposites, the elemental analysis and atomic absorption spectroscopy confirmed that investigated ZnS/MMT nanocomposites contained 4.2 wt., 3.1 wt. and 2.0 wt. of ZnS.In frame of these analyses some content of carbon in individual nanocomposites was also determined as follows: 25.0 wt., 19.4 wt. and 12.0 wt..The source of carbon was the stabilizing cationic surfactant CTAB. With respect to potential application of developed ZnS/MMT nanocomposites in liquid systems, their stability was explored in our previous works 49,50, via their shaking in water for 24 h.The dispersions were filtered and the UV-vis absorption spectra of filtrates were recorded.There was not detected any typical absorption edge of ZnS nanoparticles at about 320 nm in absorption spectra which means that the ZnS nanoparticles were firmly attached to MMT likely located in its pores 49.The stability of ZnS/MMT nanocomposites was also confirmed by the derived mathematical model 50. Fig. 1a and b shows measured nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms and evaluated pore-size distributions of investigated ZnS/MMT nanocomposites.Textural properties are summarized in Table 1.The shapes of nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms of all ZnS/MMT nanocomposites correspond to porous materials possessing dominantly larger mesopores/macropores.In addition to that, it is evident from Fig. 1a that pristine MMT possesses besides large mesopores/macropores also a small portion of micropores (pores with diameter 2 nm, V micro 2 mm 3 liq /g).According to previous research 51, the missing smallest pores in all ZnS/MMT nanocomposites and decreasing nanocomposite specific surface area can be attributed to a plugging of some part of the MMT porous structure, evidently of micropores and smaller mesopores, by CTAB which was used for ZnS/MMT nanocomposites synthesis and whose presence was proved by the determined carbon content by using AAS and elemental analysis.It was reported that the specific surface area of MMT can diminish due to the plugging of MMT porous structure by CTAB up to 4.4 m 2 /g 51.This indicates that further strongly decreased specific surface area of the 4.2 wt. ZnS/MMT nanocomposite (0.9 m 2 /g) may be a result of the secondary effect-incorporation of ZnS nanoparticles and/or ZnS agglomerates to MMT meso-macroporous structure.This phenomenon corresponds to Fig. 1b where pores with diameter 13 nm are evidently disappearing with increasing loading of ZnS nanoparticles from 3.1 to 4.2 wt.. The XRD measurements were performed in order to reveal the crystal structure of ZnS nanoparticles and to determine the inter-planar distance of 0 0 1 planes (d 001 ) of MMT.The diffraction patterns for all the samples including pristine MMT are displayed in Fig. 2a.While the presence of crystalline quartz (trigonal SiO 2 , space group P3 2 21) can be clearly seen, ZnS in any common crystalline form (sphalerite-cubic, F4; -3m; wurtzite-hexagonal, P6 3 mc) cannot be proved.This observation might be caused either by very small ZnS crystallite size or due to small amounts of ZnS nanoparticles (2-4.2 wt.) in the ZnS/MMT nanocomposites since possible ZnS peaks may coincide with those coming from MMT or quartz. The diffraction maxima corresponding to d 001 planes in MMT are displayed in detail in Fig. 2b for all the samples.A shift of the 0 0 1 diffraction peaks corresponding to an increase of the inter-planar distance d 001 with increasing concentration of ZnS can be observed (Table 2).This effect can be explained by the presence of some carbon amounts (12-25 wt.) in all the ZnS/MMT nanocomposites, which come from CTAB used during the deposition of ZnS nanoparticles and is intercalated in the MMT interlayer and thus increases the d 001 distance of MMT.This feature also pretty correlates with the decreasing specific surface area of investigated nanocomposites in the order 2.0 wt. ZnS/MMT 3.1 wt. ZnS/MMT 4.2 wt. ZnS/MMT as a consequence of increasing carbon amounts 12, 19.4 and 25 wt., respectively.However, from Table 2 and Fig. 3 is evident that the change in the inter-planar distance d 001 of MMT at 3.1 wt. and 4.2 wt.

ZnS/MMT.Previously, it has been reported that the increase in band gap energy is a result of reduction in the particle size of ZnS that is related to the quantum confinement effects 565758 a vacuum, is the dielectric constant for the ZnS (8.76), h is the Planck constant and e is the charge of an electron.Diameter (2R) of studied materials has been estimated to be 10.0 nm, 7.2 nm and 5.7 nm for ZnS/MMT with 2.0 wt., 3.1 wt. and 4.2 wt. of ZnS.The absolute values of ZnS particles calculated from UV-vis are affected by used E 0 value that has been reported to be 3.6-3.7 eV and the dielectric constant for the ZnS.This is probably a reason, why the absolute value of ZnS particles calculated from UV-vis is lower than those values determined from TEM.Nevertheless, it brings attractive connection between TEM and UV-vis results.It is surprising that the particle diameter of ZnS calculated from the band gap energy (Table 1) decreases with increasing ZnS loading.Moreover, it is in contrast to TEM results.This effect can be explained by clustering of ZnS particles with approximately of the same nano-size.While 2.0 wt. ZnS/MMT contains separated ZnS nanoparticles with approximately the same diameter of 20-40 nm (TEM-Fig.4a), 4.2 wt. ZnS/MMT contains both ZnS nanoparticles and ZnS agglomerates of micrometer-size composed of many of ZnS nanoparticles (TEM-Fig.4b).Based on that fact the decrease in the band gap energy can be associated with the dominant effect of the presence of higher amount of ZnS nanoparticles and lower amount of ZnS agglomerates. ZnS/MMT nanocomposites with different contents of ZnS were investigated for the photoreduction of CO 2 dissolved in NaOH solutions.The commercial TiO 2 Evonic P25 photocatalyst was examined as a reference for comparison.The effect of irradiation time on the formation of products was investigated over a period of 0-24 h.Fig. 6 shows the evolution of all reaction products as the functions of the irradiation for the 3.1 wt. ZnS/MMT nanocomposite.The main gaseous product was methane.Hydrogen and low amounts of carbon monoxide were also detected.Other products such as formic acid, formaldehyde, ethane and ethylene could also be formed 22,59, but they were undetectable in our GC configuration.The observed yields (mol/g cat ) order was: H 2 CH 4 CO. Comparisons of CH 4 , H 2 and CO yields over ZnS/MMT with different contents of ZnS are shown in Fig. 7a-c, respectively.A gradual increase of methane yield was observed after the start of irradiation with the exception of commercial TiO 2 catalyst.In this case the yields of methane were negligible during the first 8 h of irradiation.The highest yield of methane was observed for 3.1 wt. ZnS/MMT. In case of ZnS/MMT, the hydrogen yields continually increased during the whole experiments.In comparison with the application of commercial titanium dioxide, hydrogen was produced in 6-fold higher concentrations (Fig. 7b).The yields of carbon monoxide were increasing slowly during the reaction, but all yields were close to the limit of detection (Fig. 7c).The highest yield of both products was observed for 3.1 wt. ZnS/MMT. The data from the longest reaction time span were chosen for the overall comparison because the yields of all products were the highest and the most accurate.The results show that the photocatalytic performance of nanocomposites varies with the content of ZnS in the order of 3.1 wt. ZnS 4.2 wt. ZnS 2.0 wt. ZnS.All yields of products for ZnS/MMT nanocomposites were higher than those for the commercial photocatalyst Evonic P25.According to the blank test, the original montmorillonite does not possess any photocatalytic performance. Regarding the possible formation of reaction products in a consequence of some carbon content from CTAB presented, it is worth to mention that the formation of methane was already investigated with the developed type of nanocomposite within the blank experiments at various pH in our previous study 60.The generation of methane was observed, the effect of different pH on the methane yields was comparable.However, in our study the evolution of photocatalytic performance of ZnS/MMT nanocomposites does not follow the trend in increasing carbon content (within increasing ZnS loading), thus the determined trend in photocatalytic performance can be considered as not burdened with this fact and correct. One would assume that with increasing loading of ZnS nanoparticles, which is the only active component in the ZnS/MMT nanocomposites, the photocatalytic performance of investigated nanocomposites would escalate.However, this hypothesis was not confirmed.According to the blank test, the original montmorillonite does not possess any photocatalytic performance.Besides that, 4.2 wt. of ZnS on MMT does not assign the highest photocatalytic performance.The overall order of photocatalytic performance in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 was following: 3.1 wt. ZnS 4.2 wt. ZnS 2.0 wt. ZnS.It is evident that with higher content of ZnS the nanocomposite photocatalytic performance in the first instance increases, but then there is a decline.This indicates that probably besides the ZnS loading, also the degree of agglomeration of ZnS nanoparticles plays a key role.The agglomeration of ZnS nanoparticles increases with increasing ZnS loading as it is evident from the results of TEM and UV-vis and it could be correlated with the work function as follows.The work function is the minimum energy that must be given to an electron to liberate it from the surface of ZnS nanoparticle.If ZnS occurs on MMT as same-size nanoparticles in various ZnS loadings, the work function should be same.We suppose, if such ZnS nanoparticles agglomerate and the degree of their agglomeration is too high, the work function should be higher.In our case with increasing ZnS loading the nanoparticles agglomerate and the lowest work function is achieved for 3.1 wt. of ZnS in MMT, when ZnS is partially as separated nanoparticles and partially as agglomerates.This evidences the correlation between the degree of ZnS nanoparticles agglomeration and the work function.Fig. 8 shows the correlation between the yields of methane after 24 h of irradiation and the work function of each catalyst.It can be seen from Fig. 8 that the lowest electron work function corresponds to the most active catalyst.This observation is in agreement with our previous observations over cerium doped TiO 2 nanoparticulated photocatalysts in the same reaction 61 and corresponds to the reaction mechanism.The photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide is conducted via generated electrons and the 3.1 wt. ZnS/MMT nanocomposite releases those electrons most easily.Contrary to that, pristine montmorillonite shows no photocatalytic performance, corresponding nicely to very high electron work function. The valence band of sulfide semiconductors, made of 3p orbitals of the sulfur atoms, is shifted upwards compared with those of the oxide analogues, while the conduction band electrons are also more reductive 62.For the CO 2 photocatalytic reduction the electron energy in conduction band must be higher than H reduction potential and the hole energy in valence band must be lower than OH -oxidation potentials.ZnS is a direct wide band gap semiconductor (Eg 3.6 eV in the bulk) 63, hence it absorbs only in the UV range, but it possesses a strongly reducing conduction band (E CB -1.85V versus the NHE at pH 7) 64.The addition of ZnS to MMT should result in changing the band gap and the absorption edge energies can be expected and was also experimentally demonstrated (see Fig. 5).However, it is always difficult to predict separately the shift of conduction and valence band energies, which are extremely important with respect to required oxidation and reduction potentials. The work function for different ZnS contents shown in Fig. 8 can help us to elucidate the shifts of conduction as well as valence bands.For simplicity the Fermi level on nanoparticle surface is supposed to be pinned to the middle of the nanoparticle band gap.Deriving from Figs. 5 and8 and Table 1, we can estimate that the energy of electrons on the conduction band edge is -2.066 eV, while the valence band edge is -5.716 eV for 2.0 wt. ZnS/MMT (Fig. 9a).For 3.1 wt. ZnS/MMT the energy of electrons on the conduction band edge increases about approximately 134 meV, while the valence band edge shifts up by 54 meV.Further increase of ZnS content up to 4.2 wt. led only to a much smaller conduction band decrease (21 meV), whereas the valence band edge shifts down by 89 meV.These shifts are depicted in Fig. 9b.Higher levels of the conduction band are more effective for the creation of H ions which are necessary for CO 2 reduction.It can be concluded that for 3.1 wt. of ZnS the carriers have the most suitable potentials for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 . In summary: Since the optical and electronic properties of nanocomposites have been considered as key properties related to the mechanism of CO 2 photocatalytic reduction and there exist the correlation between the band gap energy, the nanoparticle work function and the degree of agglomeration of nanoparticles, the behavior of ZnS on nano-size level plays the determining role.The shift in conduction band and valence band energies of ZnS at different ZnS loadings is a consequence of different degree of ZnS nanoparticles agglomeration on MMT. ZnS nanoparticles stabilized by cetyltrimethylammonium bromide were deposited on montmorillonite (MMT) forming the ZnS/MMT nanocomposites with ZnS loadings within 2.0-4.2wt..The key role in the performance of ZnS/MMT nanocomposites in the CO 2 photocatalytic reduction played the energies of electrons and holes within the electronic structure of designed photocatalytic materials, which were in fact affected by ZnS loadings.The potentials of electrons and holes required for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 were the most suitable for the 3.1 wt. ZnS/MMT nanocomposite.All prepared ZnS/MMT nanocomposites exhibited higher efficiency in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction in comparison with the commercial TiO 2 Evonic P25.

With respect to potential application of developed ZnS/MMT nanocomposites in liquid systems, their stability was explored in our previous works 49,50, via their shaking in water for 24 h.The dispersions were filtered and the UV-vis absorption spectra of filtrates were recorded.There was not detected any typical absorption edge of ZnS nanoparticles at about 320 nm in absorption spectra which means that the ZnS nanoparticles were firmly attached to MMT likely located in its pores 49.The stability of ZnS/MMT nanocomposites was also confirmed by the derived mathematical model 50. Fig. 1a and b shows measured nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms and evaluated pore-size distributions of investigated ZnS/MMT nanocomposites.Textural properties are summarized in Table 1.The shapes of nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms of all ZnS/MMT nanocomposites correspond to porous materials possessing dominantly larger mesopores/macropores.In addition to that, it is evident from Fig. 1a that pristine MMT possesses besides large mesopores/macropores also a small portion of micropores (pores with diameter 2 nm, V micro 2 mm 3 liq /g).According to previous research 51, the missing smallest pores in all ZnS/MMT nanocomposites and decreasing nanocomposite specific surface area can be attributed to a plugging of some part of the MMT porous structure, evidently of micropores and smaller mesopores, by CTAB which was used for ZnS/MMT nanocomposites synthesis and whose presence was proved by the determined carbon content by using AAS and elemental analysis.It was reported that the specific surface area of MMT can diminish due to the plugging of MMT porous structure by CTAB up to 4.4 m 2 /g 51.This indicates that further strongly decreased specific surface area of the 4.2 wt. ZnS/MMT nanocomposite (0.9 m 2 /g) may be a result of the secondary effect-incorporation of ZnS nanoparticles and/or ZnS agglomerates to MMT meso-macroporous structure.This phenomenon corresponds to Fig. 1b where pores with diameter 13 nm are evidently disappearing with increasing loading of ZnS nanoparticles from 3.1 to 4.2 wt.. The XRD measurements were performed in order to reveal the crystal structure of ZnS nanoparticles and to determine the inter-planar distance of 0 0 1 planes (d 001 ) of MMT.The diffraction patterns for all the samples including pristine MMT are displayed in Fig. 2a.While the presence of crystalline quartz (trigonal SiO 2 , space group P3 2 21) can be clearly seen, ZnS in any common crystalline form (sphalerite-cubic, F4; -3m; wurtzite-hexagonal, P6 3 mc) cannot be proved.This observation might be caused either by very small ZnS crystallite size or due to small amounts of ZnS nanoparticles (2-4.2 wt.) in the ZnS/MMT nanocomposites since possible ZnS peaks may coincide with those coming from MMT or quartz. The diffraction maxima corresponding to d 001 planes in MMT are displayed in detail in Fig. 2b for all the samples.A shift of the 0 0 1 diffraction peaks corresponding to an increase of the inter-planar distance d 001 with increasing concentration of ZnS can be observed (Table 2).This effect can be explained by the presence of some carbon amounts (12-25 wt.) in all the ZnS/MMT nanocomposites, which come from CTAB used during the deposition of ZnS nanoparticles and is intercalated in the MMT interlayer and thus increases the d 001 distance of MMT.This feature also pretty correlates with the decreasing specific surface area of investigated nanocomposites in the order 2.0 wt. ZnS/MMT 3.1 wt. ZnS/MMT 4.2 wt. ZnS/MMT as a consequence of increasing carbon amounts 12, 19.4 and 25 wt., respectively.However, from Table 2 and Fig. 3 is evident that the change in the inter-planar distance d 001 of MMT at 3.1 wt. and 4.2 wt. ZnS loadings is not so substantial despite the significantly increased carbon amount (19.4 and 25 wt., respectively).It reveals that at 4.2 wt. of deposited ZnS the effect of CTAB intercalation to the MMT interlayer is comparable to that for 3.1 wt. of ZnS and thus the significantly decreased specific surface area of 4.2 wt. ZnS/MMT nanocomposite (0.9 m 2 /g) can be caused by plugging of MMT mesopores and macropores by additional CTAB as well as ZnS nanoparticles or their agglomerates, e.g. in the pore mouths.The observations from XRD pretty support the observations from nitrogen physisorption. The position of the 0 0 1 diffraction peak in MMT and corresponding inter-planar distances d001 with estimated errors.Arising from previous knowledge about possible agglomeration of ZnS nanoparticles stabilized by CTAB 52 and in order to support hypotheses about plugging of MMT porous structure also by ZnS nanoparticles/agglomerates, the TEM analysis of ZnS/MMT nanocomposites was performed as well.The TEM micrographs showing ZnS agglomerates of different sizes deposited on the external surface of MMT are shown in Fig. 4a andb.A detailed view of one ZnS agglomerate revealed that the agglomerates were composed of individual ZnS nanoparticles with sizes of about 20-40 nm.It is in contrast with determined gap energies (see below) corresponding to sizes equal and smaller than 10 nm when the quantum size effect occurs.This apparent disagreement indicates that ZnS nanoparticles of different sizes as well as agglomerated in large agglomerates with sizes of several hundred nanometers exist on MMT.Formation of agglomerates is key for understanding different photocatalytic efficiency discussed below. Since the same ZnS suspension was used for the preparation of all ZnS/MMT nanocomposites, the size of ZnS nanoparticles does not determine the differences between them.As reported in our previous study 28, ZnS nanoparticles and CTAB form agglomerates attached. The mean size of ZnS nanoparticles was estimated from their optical properties in a suspension, i.e. before they were deposited on MMT.The well described size-dependence of absorption spectra was considered and the effective mass approximation was utilized to obtain the size of ZnS nanoparticles from the following Brus equation 53: where E bg (bulk) and E bg (nano) are the band bap energies of bulk and nano-sized semiconductors, respectively, h is the Planck' constant, m e and m h are the effective masses of electron and hole, respectively, and is the dielectric constant of the material.Here, m e 0.42 m 0 and m h 0.61 m 0 , where m 0 is the free electron mass and the dielectric constant e 8.76 54.The band gap energy of ZnS nanoparticles was estimated from the linear part of the (h ) 0.5 versus (h ) plot as described in our previous work 28.Fig. 5 shows the UV-vis spectra of ZnS/MMT nanocomposites.The band gap energy of ZnS/MMT with 2.0 wt. of ZnS was 3.65 eV (Table 1).This value is close to that band gap energy reported for bulk ZnS (3.6-3.7 eV) 55.The band gap energy of ZnS/MMT increased with increasing concentration of ZnS up to 3.84 eV for 4.2 wt. ZnS/MMT.Previously, it has been reported that the increase in band gap energy is a result of reduction in the particle size of ZnS that is related to the quantum confinement effects 565758 a vacuum, is the dielectric constant for the ZnS (8.76), h is the Planck constant and e is the charge of an electron.Diameter (2R) of studied materials has been estimated to be 10.0 nm, 7.2 nm and 5.7 nm for ZnS/MMT with 2.0 wt., 3.1 wt. and 4.2 wt. of ZnS.The absolute values of ZnS particles calculated from UV-vis are affected by used E 0 value that has been reported to be 3.6-3.7 eV and the dielectric constant for the ZnS.This is probably a reason, why the absolute value of ZnS particles calculated from UV-vis is lower than those values determined from TEM.Nevertheless, it brings attractive connection between TEM and UV-vis results.It is surprising that the particle diameter of ZnS calculated from the band gap energy (Table 1) decreases with increasing ZnS loading.Moreover, it is in contrast to TEM results.This effect can be explained by clustering of ZnS particles with approximately of the same nano-size.While 2.0 wt. ZnS/MMT contains separated ZnS nanoparticles with approximately the same diameter of 20-40 nm (TEM-Fig.4a), 4.2 wt. ZnS/MMT contains both ZnS nanoparticles and ZnS agglomerates of micrometer-size composed of many of ZnS nanoparticles (TEM-Fig.4b).Based on that fact the decrease in the band gap energy can be associated with the dominant effect of the presence of higher amount of ZnS nanoparticles and lower amount of ZnS agglomerates. ZnS/MMT nanocomposites with different contents of ZnS were investigated for the photoreduction of CO 2 dissolved in NaOH solutions.The commercial TiO 2 Evonic P25 photocatalyst was examined as a reference for comparison.The effect of irradiation time on the formation of products was investigated over a period of 0-24 h.Fig. 6 shows the evolution of all reaction products as the functions of the irradiation for the 3.1 wt. ZnS/MMT nanocomposite.The main gaseous product was methane.Hydrogen and low amounts of carbon monoxide were also detected.Other products such as formic acid, formaldehyde, ethane and ethylene could also be formed 22,59, but they were undetectable in our GC configuration.The observed yields (mol/g cat ) order was: H 2 CH 4 CO. Comparisons of CH 4 , H 2 and CO yields over ZnS/MMT with different contents of ZnS are shown in Fig. 7a-c, respectively.A gradual increase of methane yield was observed after the start of irradiation with the exception of commercial TiO 2 catalyst.In this case the yields of methane were negligible during the first 8 h of irradiation.The highest yield of methane was observed for 3.1 wt. ZnS/MMT. In case of ZnS/MMT, the hydrogen yields continually increased during the whole experiments.In comparison with the application of commercial titanium dioxide, hydrogen was produced in 6-fold higher concentrations (Fig. 7b).The yields of carbon monoxide were increasing slowly during the reaction, but all yields were close to the limit of detection (Fig. 7c).The highest yield of both products was observed for 3.1 wt. ZnS/MMT. The data from the longest reaction time span were chosen for the overall comparison because the yields of all products were the highest and the most accurate.The results show that the photocatalytic performance of nanocomposites varies with the content of ZnS in the order of 3.1 wt. ZnS 4.2 wt. ZnS 2.0 wt. ZnS.All yields of products for ZnS/MMT nanocomposites were higher than those for the commercial photocatalyst Evonic P25.According to the blank test, the original montmorillonite does not possess any photocatalytic performance. Regarding the possible formation of reaction products in a consequence of some carbon content from CTAB presented, it is worth to mention that the formation of methane was already investigated with the developed type of nanocomposite within the blank experiments at various pH in our previous study 60.The generation of methane was observed, the effect of different pH on the methane yields was comparable.However, in our study the evolution of photocatalytic performance of ZnS/MMT nanocomposites does not follow the trend in increasing carbon content (within increasing ZnS loading), thus the determined trend in photocatalytic performance can be considered as not burdened with this fact and correct. One would assume that with increasing loading of ZnS nanoparticles, which is the only active component in the ZnS/MMT nanocomposites, the photocatalytic performance of investigated nanocomposites would escalate.However, this hypothesis was not confirmed.According to the blank test, the original montmorillonite does not possess any photocatalytic performance.Besides that, 4.2 wt. of ZnS on MMT does not assign the highest photocatalytic performance.The overall order of photocatalytic performance in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 was following: 3.1 wt. ZnS 4.2 wt. ZnS 2.0 wt. ZnS.It is evident that with higher content of ZnS the nanocomposite photocatalytic performance in the first instance increases, but then there is a decline.This indicates that probably besides the ZnS loading, also the degree of agglomeration of ZnS nanoparticles plays a key role.The agglomeration of ZnS nanoparticles increases with increasing ZnS loading as it is evident from the results of TEM and UV-vis and it could be correlated with the work function as follows.The work function is the minimum energy that must be given to an electron to liberate it from the surface of ZnS nanoparticle.If ZnS occurs on MMT as same-size nanoparticles in various ZnS loadings, the work function should be same.We suppose, if such ZnS nanoparticles agglomerate and the degree of their agglomeration is too high, the work function should be higher.In our case with increasing ZnS loading the nanoparticles agglomerate and the lowest work function is achieved for 3.1 wt. of ZnS in MMT, when ZnS is partially as separated nanoparticles and partially as agglomerates.This evidences the correlation between the degree of ZnS nanoparticles agglomeration and the work function.Fig. 8 shows the correlation between the yields of methane after 24 h of irradiation and the work function of each catalyst.It can be seen from Fig. 8 that the lowest electron work function corresponds to the most active catalyst.This observation is in agreement with our previous observations over cerium doped TiO 2 nanoparticulated photocatalysts in the same reaction 61 and corresponds to the reaction mechanism.The photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide is conducted via generated electrons and the 3.1 wt. ZnS/MMT nanocomposite releases those electrons most easily.Contrary to that, pristine montmorillonite shows no photocatalytic performance, corresponding nicely to very high electron work function. The valence band of sulfide semiconductors, made of 3p orbitals of the sulfur atoms, is shifted upwards compared with those of the oxide analogues, while the conduction band electrons are also more reductive 62.For the CO 2 photocatalytic reduction the electron energy in conduction band must be higher than H reduction potential and the hole energy in valence band must be lower than OH -oxidation potentials.ZnS is a direct wide band gap semiconductor (Eg 3.6 eV in the bulk) 63, hence it absorbs only in the UV range, but it possesses a strongly reducing conduction band (E CB -1.85V versus the NHE at pH 7) 64.The addition of ZnS to MMT should result in changing the band gap and the absorption edge energies can be expected and was also experimentally demonstrated (see Fig. 5).However, it is always difficult to predict separately the shift of conduction and valence band energies, which are extremely important with respect to required oxidation and reduction potentials. The work function for different ZnS contents shown in Fig. 8 can help us to elucidate the shifts of conduction as well as valence bands.For simplicity the Fermi level on nanoparticle surface is supposed to be pinned to the middle of the nanoparticle band gap.Deriving from Figs. 5 and8 and Table 1, we can estimate that the energy of electrons on the conduction band edge is -2.066 eV, while the valence band edge is -5.716 eV for 2.0 wt. ZnS/MMT (Fig. 9a).For 3.1 wt. ZnS/MMT the energy of electrons on the conduction band edge increases about approximately 134 meV, while the valence band edge shifts up by 54 meV.Further increase of ZnS content up to 4.2 wt. led only to a much smaller conduction band decrease (21 meV), whereas the valence band edge shifts down by 89 meV.These shifts are depicted in Fig. 9b.Higher levels of the conduction band are more effective for the creation of H ions which are necessary for CO 2 reduction.It can be concluded that for 3.1 wt. of ZnS the carriers have the most suitable potentials for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 . In summary: Since the optical and electronic properties of nanocomposites have been considered as key properties related to the mechanism of CO 2 photocatalytic reduction and there exist the correlation between the band gap energy, the nanoparticle work function and the degree of agglomeration of nanoparticles, the behavior of ZnS on nano-size level plays the determining role.The shift in conduction band and valence band energies of ZnS at different ZnS loadings is a consequence of different degree of ZnS nanoparticles agglomeration on MMT."}], "operation mode": [{"llm generation": "Batch", "source": "The photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide was carried out in a stirred batch annular reactor with a suspended catalyst illuminated by the UV 8 W Hg-lamp (254 nm).", "context": "Two-step preparation of ZnS/MMT was described in detail in our previous work 28.Briefly, ZnS nanoparticles were formed by adding of the sodium sulphide and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) solution (solution A) dropwise to the solution of zinc acetate (solution B).The ZnS-CTAB was subsequently deposited on montmorillonite by shaking 1 L of 2 mM ZnS solution with 2 g of MMT for 24 h followed by filtration, washing and drying.Two variations in the above-described synthesis were done in order to positively influence the resulting nanocomposite efficiency.The first one, the addition of the solution B to the solution A changes pH during the ZnS nanoparticles nucleation since sodium sulphide is a base.The composite obtained by shaking such formed ZnS nanoparticles with MMT was denoted as 4.2 wt. ZnS/MMT.The second variation, the ratio of ZnS suspension volume to MMT weight was varied from 1:2 (L:g) to 1:4 and 1:8, resulting in nanocomposites denoted as 3.1 wt. ZnS/MMT and 2.0 wt. ZnS/MMT. The content of ZnS in ZnS/MMT nanocomposites was determined by elemental analysis of sulphur performed by a combustion analyser ELTRA (Eltra, Germany) and determination of zinc after their dissolution in a mixture of HF, HNO 3 and HClO 4 41 by an atomic absorption spectrometer AA280FS (Varian Inc., Austria). The nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurements at 77 K were performed using the volumetric apparatus Nova2000e (Quntachrome, USA).Prior to the nitrogen physisorption measurements, the samples were degassed at 105 C for 4 h under vacuum less than 1 Pa.Degassing at temperature of 105 C was applied in order to remove physisorbed water, however, with no influence on the textural or structural properties of investigated nanocomposites.The specific surface area, S BET , was calculated according to the classical Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) theory for the relative pressure range p/p 0 0.05-0.3042.Since the specific surface area, S BET , is not such a proper parameter in the case of mesoporous solids containing some micropores 42,43, the mesopore surface area, S meso , and the micropore volume, V micro , were additionally also evaluated based on the t-plot method 44, using DeBoer standard isotherm.The net pore volume, V net , was determined from the nitrogen adsorption isotherm at maximum p/p 0 (0.991).The mesoporesize distribution (pore diameter 3-130 nm) was evaluated from the adsorption branch of the nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm by the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method 45, using the DeBoer standard isotherm and the assumption of the cylindrical pore geometry. The X-ray diffraction powder (XRD) patterns were measured by a standard laboratory diffractometer in the conventional focusing Bragg-Brentano geometry with variable slits (Ni-filtered Cu K, 1.4 kW).A linear detector was used to collect the scattered intensity. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations were carried out on a JEOL 2010F microscope operated at 200 kV (LaB6 cathode, resolution 0.19 nm) using carbon coated copper grid. UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of prepared samples (grain size 0.160 mm) were measured by using a GBS CINTRA 303 spectrometer equipped with a Spectralon-coated integrating sphere using a Spectralon coated discs as a standard.The spectra were recorded in the range of the wavelength 200-800 nm (lamps switched at 350 nm).The reflectances were re-calculated to the absorption using the Schuster-Kubelka-Munk equation, where R is the diffuse reflectance from a semi-infinite layer.The obtained spectra were transformed to the dependencies (F(R )h ) 2 against h and assuming that the Tauc's law 46,47 can be expressed as: , where the Eg is the energy of absorption edge values (determined from obtained plots), h is the Planck constant and is the light frequency.Kubelka-Munk function was used to estimate the band gap energy of prepared photocatalysts.The optical absorption threshold (lg) was calculated using the equation, lg 1240/EB, where EB is the band gap energy. The contact potential difference (V CPD ) measurements were carried out by the dynamic condenser method of Kelvin with a KP6500 probe (McAllister Technical Services).The reference electrode was a standard stainless steel plate with diameter of 3 mm ( r ef 4.3 eV) provided by the manufacturer.During the measurements the gradient of the peak-to-peak versus backing potential was set to 0.2, whereas the vibration frequency and amplitude was set to 120 Hz and 40 a.u.The final V CPD value was an average of 60 independent points using two backing potentials.The measurements were carried out under atmospheric pressure and ambient temperature.Before measurements the samples were pressed into pellets of 10 mm diameter using the 8 MPa pressure.The work function values were obtained from a simple relation V CPD ref - sample . The photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide was carried out in a stirred batch annular reactor with a suspended catalyst illuminated by the UV 8 W Hg-lamp (254 nm).The CO 2 diffusion from the gas phase through the gas-liquid interface in a laboratory batch slurry reactor was eliminated by saturating the aqueous solutions of 0.2 mmol/L NaOH with pure CO 2 before the beginning of reactions.During this step, pH decreased from 11.8 to 6.6.The catalyst loading of 1 g/L was chosen to avoid the concentration gradients in a bulk of stirred liquid with the dispersion due to a scattering effect of light as a result of the high nanocomposite concentration.A suitable volume of 100 mL of the liquid phase was used to ensure the perfect mixing in this photoreactor 48.CO 2 reduction products, such as hydrogen, methane and carbon monoxide, were analysed by a gas chromatograph (GC-Agilent Technologies 6890N) equipped with FID and TCD detectors (GC/FID/TCD) and the Molsieve and HP Poraplot Q columns.The calibration with certified calibration gases (0.05 mol.CH 4 , 0.987 mol.H 2 , 2.02 mol.CO, and 99.999 mol.CO 2 ) was performed before each experimental run. Concerning the chemical composition of nanocomposites, the elemental analysis and atomic absorption spectroscopy confirmed that investigated ZnS/MMT nanocomposites contained 4.2 wt., 3.1 wt. and 2.0 wt. of ZnS.In frame of these analyses some content of carbon in individual nanocomposites was also determined as follows: 25.0 wt., 19.4 wt. and 12.0 wt..The source of carbon was the stabilizing cationic surfactant CTAB. With respect to potential application of developed ZnS/MMT nanocomposites in liquid systems, their stability was explored in our previous works 49,50, via their shaking in water for 24 h.The dispersions were filtered and the UV-vis absorption spectra of filtrates were recorded.There was not detected any typical absorption edge of ZnS nanoparticles at about 320 nm in absorption spectra which means that the ZnS nanoparticles were firmly attached to MMT likely located in its pores 49.The stability of ZnS/MMT nanocomposites was also confirmed by the derived mathematical model 50. Fig. 1a and b shows measured nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms and evaluated pore-size distributions of investigated ZnS/MMT nanocomposites.Textural properties are summarized in Table 1.The shapes of nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms of all ZnS/MMT nanocomposites correspond to porous materials possessing dominantly larger mesopores/macropores.In addition to that, it is evident from Fig. 1a that pristine MMT possesses besides large mesopores/macropores also a small portion of micropores (pores with diameter 2 nm, V micro 2 mm 3 liq /g).According to previous research 51, the missing smallest pores in all ZnS/MMT nanocomposites and decreasing nanocomposite specific surface area can be attributed to a plugging of some part of the MMT porous structure, evidently of micropores and smaller mesopores, by CTAB which was used for ZnS/MMT nanocomposites synthesis and whose presence was proved by the determined carbon content by using AAS and elemental analysis.It was reported that the specific surface area of MMT can diminish due to the plugging of MMT porous structure by CTAB up to 4.4 m 2 /g 51.This indicates that further strongly decreased specific surface area of the 4.2 wt. ZnS/MMT nanocomposite (0.9 m 2 /g) may be a result of the secondary effect-incorporation of ZnS nanoparticles and/or ZnS agglomerates to MMT meso-macroporous structure.This phenomenon corresponds to Fig. 1b where pores with diameter 13 nm are evidently disappearing with increasing loading of ZnS nanoparticles from 3.1 to 4.2 wt.. The XRD measurements were performed in order to reveal the crystal structure of ZnS nanoparticles and to determine the inter-planar distance of 0 0 1 planes (d 001 ) of MMT.The diffraction patterns for all the samples including pristine MMT are displayed in Fig. 2a.While the presence of crystalline quartz (trigonal SiO 2 , space group P3 2 21) can be clearly seen, ZnS in any common crystalline form (sphalerite-cubic, F4; -3m; wurtzite-hexagonal, P6 3 mc) cannot be proved.This observation might be caused either by very small ZnS crystallite size or due to small amounts of ZnS nanoparticles (2-4.2 wt.) in the ZnS/MMT nanocomposites since possible ZnS peaks may coincide with those coming from MMT or quartz. The diffraction maxima corresponding to d 001 planes in MMT are displayed in detail in Fig. 2b for all the samples.A shift of the 0 0 1 diffraction peaks corresponding to an increase of the inter-planar distance d 001 with increasing concentration of ZnS can be observed (Table 2).This effect can be explained by the presence of some carbon amounts (12-25 wt.) in all the ZnS/MMT nanocomposites, which come from CTAB used during the deposition of ZnS nanoparticles and is intercalated in the MMT interlayer and thus increases the d 001 distance of MMT.This feature also pretty correlates with the decreasing specific surface area of investigated nanocomposites in the order 2.0 wt. ZnS/MMT 3.1 wt. ZnS/MMT 4.2 wt. ZnS/MMT as a consequence of increasing carbon amounts 12, 19.4 and 25 wt., respectively.However, from Table 2 and Fig. 3 is evident that the change in the inter-planar distance d 001 of MMT at 3.1 wt. and 4.2 wt. ZnS loadings is not so substantial despite the significantly increased carbon amount (19.4 and 25 wt., respectively).It reveals that at 4.2 wt. of deposited ZnS the effect of CTAB intercalation to the MMT interlayer is comparable to that for 3.1 wt. of ZnS and thus the significantly decreased specific surface area of 4.2 wt. ZnS/MMT nanocomposite (0.9 m 2 /g) can be caused by plugging of MMT mesopores and macropores by additional CTAB as well as ZnS nanoparticles or their agglomerates, e.g. in the pore mouths.The observations from XRD pretty support the observations from nitrogen physisorption. The position of the 0 0 1 diffraction peak in MMT and corresponding inter-planar distances d001 with estimated errors.Arising from previous knowledge about possible agglomeration of ZnS nanoparticles stabilized by CTAB 52 and in order to support hypotheses about plugging of MMT porous structure also by ZnS nanoparticles/agglomerates, the TEM analysis of ZnS/MMT nanocomposites was performed as well.The TEM micrographs showing ZnS agglomerates of different sizes deposited on the external surface of MMT are shown in Fig. 4a andb.A detailed view of one ZnS agglomerate revealed that the agglomerates were composed of individual ZnS nanoparticles with sizes of about 20-40 nm.It is in contrast with determined gap energies (see below) corresponding to sizes equal and smaller than 10 nm when the quantum size effect occurs.This apparent disagreement indicates that ZnS nanoparticles of different sizes as well as agglomerated in large agglomerates with sizes of several hundred nanometers exist on MMT.Formation of agglomerates is key for understanding different photocatalytic efficiency discussed below. Since the same ZnS suspension was used for the preparation of all ZnS/MMT nanocomposites, the size of ZnS nanoparticles does not determine the differences between them.As reported in our previous study 28, ZnS nanoparticles and CTAB form agglomerates attached. The mean size of ZnS nanoparticles was estimated from their optical properties in a suspension, i.e. before they were deposited on MMT.The well described size-dependence of absorption spectra was considered and the effective mass approximation was utilized to obtain the size of ZnS nanoparticles from the following Brus equation 53: where E bg (bulk) and E bg (nano) are the band bap energies of bulk and nano-sized semiconductors, respectively, h is the Planck' constant, m e and m h are the effective masses of electron and hole, respectively, and is the dielectric constant of the material.Here, m e 0.42 m 0 and m h 0.61 m 0 , where m 0 is the free electron mass and the dielectric constant e 8.76 54.The band gap energy of ZnS nanoparticles was estimated from the linear part of the (h ) 0.5 versus (h ) plot as described in our previous work 28.Fig. 5 shows the UV-vis spectra of ZnS/MMT nanocomposites.The band gap energy of ZnS/MMT with 2.0 wt. of ZnS was 3.65 eV (Table 1).This value is close to that band gap energy reported for bulk ZnS (3.6-3.7 eV) 55.The band gap energy of ZnS/MMT increased with increasing concentration of ZnS up to 3.84 eV for 4.2 wt. ZnS/MMT.Previously, it has been reported that the increase in band gap energy is a result of reduction in the particle size of ZnS that is related to the quantum confinement effects 565758 a vacuum, is the dielectric constant for the ZnS (8.76), h is the Planck constant and e is the charge of an electron.Diameter (2R) of studied materials has been estimated to be 10.0 nm, 7.2 nm and 5.7 nm for ZnS/MMT with 2.0 wt., 3.1 wt. and 4.2 wt. of ZnS.The absolute values of ZnS particles calculated from UV-vis are affected by used E 0 value that has been reported to be 3.6-3.7 eV and the dielectric constant for the ZnS.This is probably a reason, why the absolute value of ZnS particles calculated from UV-vis is lower than those values determined from TEM.Nevertheless, it brings attractive connection between TEM and UV-vis results.It is surprising that the particle diameter of ZnS calculated from the band gap energy (Table 1) decreases with increasing ZnS loading.Moreover, it is in contrast to TEM results.This effect can be explained by clustering of ZnS particles with approximately of the same nano-size.While 2.0 wt. ZnS/MMT contains separated ZnS nanoparticles with approximately the same diameter of 20-40 nm (TEM-Fig.4a), 4.2 wt. ZnS/MMT contains both ZnS nanoparticles and ZnS agglomerates of micrometer-size composed of many of ZnS nanoparticles (TEM-Fig.4b).Based on that fact the decrease in the band gap energy can be associated with the dominant effect of the presence of higher amount of ZnS nanoparticles and lower amount of ZnS agglomerates. ZnS/MMT nanocomposites with different contents of ZnS were investigated for the photoreduction of CO 2 dissolved in NaOH solutions.The commercial TiO 2 Evonic P25 photocatalyst was examined as a reference for comparison.The effect of irradiation time on the formation of products was investigated over a period of 0-24 h.Fig. 6 shows the evolution of all reaction products as the functions of the irradiation for the 3.1 wt. ZnS/MMT nanocomposite.The main gaseous product was methane.Hydrogen and low amounts of carbon monoxide were also detected.Other products such as formic acid, formaldehyde, ethane and ethylene could also be formed 22,59, but they were undetectable in our GC configuration.The observed yields (mol/g cat ) order was: H 2 CH 4 CO. Comparisons of CH 4 , H 2 and CO yields over ZnS/MMT with different contents of ZnS are shown in Fig. 7a-c, respectively.A gradual increase of methane yield was observed after the start of irradiation with the exception of commercial TiO 2 catalyst.In this case the yields of methane were negligible during the first 8 h of irradiation.The highest yield of methane was observed for 3.1 wt. ZnS/MMT. In case of ZnS/MMT, the hydrogen yields continually increased during the whole experiments.In comparison with the application of commercial titanium dioxide, hydrogen was produced in 6-fold higher concentrations (Fig. 7b).The yields of carbon monoxide were increasing slowly during the reaction, but all yields were close to the limit of detection (Fig. 7c).The highest yield of both products was observed for 3.1 wt. ZnS/MMT. The data from the longest reaction time span were chosen for the overall comparison because the yields of all products were the highest and the most accurate.The results show that the photocatalytic performance of nanocomposites varies with the content of ZnS in the order of 3.1 wt. ZnS 4.2 wt. ZnS 2.0 wt. ZnS.All yields of products for ZnS/MMT nanocomposites were higher than those for the commercial photocatalyst Evonic P25.According to the blank test, the original montmorillonite does not possess any photocatalytic performance. Regarding the possible formation of reaction products in a consequence of some carbon content from CTAB presented, it is worth to mention that the formation of methane was already investigated with the developed type of nanocomposite within the blank experiments at various pH in our previous study 60.The generation of methane was observed, the effect of different pH on the methane yields was comparable.However, in our study the evolution of photocatalytic performance of ZnS/MMT nanocomposites does not follow the trend in increasing carbon content (within increasing ZnS loading), thus the determined trend in photocatalytic performance can be considered as not burdened with this fact and correct. One would assume that with increasing loading of ZnS nanoparticles, which is the only active component in the ZnS/MMT nanocomposites, the photocatalytic performance of investigated nanocomposites would escalate.However, this hypothesis was not confirmed.According to the blank test, the original montmorillonite does not possess any photocatalytic performance.Besides that, 4.2 wt. of ZnS on MMT does not assign the highest photocatalytic performance.The overall order of photocatalytic performance in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 was following: 3.1 wt. ZnS 4.2 wt. ZnS 2.0 wt. ZnS.It is evident that with higher content of ZnS the nanocomposite photocatalytic performance in the first instance increases, but then there is a decline.This indicates that probably besides the ZnS loading, also the degree of agglomeration of ZnS nanoparticles plays a key role.The agglomeration of ZnS nanoparticles increases with increasing ZnS loading as it is evident from the results of TEM and UV-vis and it could be correlated with the work function as follows.The work function is the minimum energy that must be given to an electron to liberate it from the surface of ZnS nanoparticle.If ZnS occurs on MMT as same-size nanoparticles in various ZnS loadings, the work function should be same.We suppose, if such ZnS nanoparticles agglomerate and the degree of their agglomeration is too high, the work function should be higher.In our case with increasing ZnS loading the nanoparticles agglomerate and the lowest work function is achieved for 3.1 wt. of ZnS in MMT, when ZnS is partially as separated nanoparticles and partially as agglomerates.This evidences the correlation between the degree of ZnS nanoparticles agglomeration and the work function.Fig. 8 shows the correlation between the yields of methane after 24 h of irradiation and the work function of each catalyst.It can be seen from Fig. 8 that the lowest electron work function corresponds to the most active catalyst.This observation is in agreement with our previous observations over cerium doped TiO 2 nanoparticulated photocatalysts in the same reaction 61 and corresponds to the reaction mechanism.The photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide is conducted via generated electrons and the 3.1 wt. ZnS/MMT nanocomposite releases those electrons most easily.Contrary to that, pristine montmorillonite shows no photocatalytic performance, corresponding nicely to very high electron work function. The valence band of sulfide semiconductors, made of 3p orbitals of the sulfur atoms, is shifted upwards compared with those of the oxide analogues, while the conduction band electrons are also more reductive 62.For the CO 2 photocatalytic reduction the electron energy in conduction band must be higher than H reduction potential and the hole energy in valence band must be lower than OH -oxidation potentials.ZnS is a direct wide band gap semiconductor (Eg 3.6 eV in the bulk) 63, hence it absorbs only in the UV range, but it possesses a strongly reducing conduction band (E CB -1.85V versus the NHE at pH 7) 64.The addition of ZnS to MMT should result in changing the band gap and the absorption edge energies can be expected and was also experimentally demonstrated (see Fig. 5).However, it is always difficult to predict separately the shift of conduction and valence band energies, which are extremely important with respect to required oxidation and reduction potentials. The work function for different ZnS contents shown in Fig. 8 can help us to elucidate the shifts of conduction as well as valence bands.For simplicity the Fermi level on nanoparticle surface is supposed to be pinned to the middle of the nanoparticle band gap.Deriving from Figs. 5 and8 and Table 1, we can estimate that the energy of electrons on the conduction band edge is -2.066 eV, while the valence band edge is -5.716 eV for 2.0 wt. ZnS/MMT (Fig. 9a).For 3.1 wt. ZnS/MMT the energy of electrons on the conduction band edge increases about approximately 134 meV, while the valence band edge shifts up by 54 meV.Further increase of ZnS content up to 4.2 wt. led only to a much smaller conduction band decrease (21 meV), whereas the valence band edge shifts down by 89 meV.These shifts are depicted in Fig. 9b.Higher levels of the conduction band are more effective for the creation of H ions which are necessary for CO 2 reduction.It can be concluded that for 3.1 wt. of ZnS the carriers have the most suitable potentials for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 . In summary: Since the optical and electronic properties of nanocomposites have been considered as key properties related to the mechanism of CO 2 photocatalytic reduction and there exist the correlation between the band gap energy, the nanoparticle work function and the degree of agglomeration of nanoparticles, the behavior of ZnS on nano-size level plays the determining role.The shift in conduction band and valence band energies of ZnS at different ZnS loadings is a consequence of different degree of ZnS nanoparticles agglomeration on MMT. ZnS nanoparticles stabilized by cetyltrimethylammonium bromide were deposited on montmorillonite (MMT) forming the ZnS/MMT nanocomposites with ZnS loadings within 2.0-4.2wt..The key role in the performance of ZnS/MMT nanocomposites in the CO 2 photocatalytic reduction played the energies of electrons and holes within the electronic structure of designed photocatalytic materials, which were in fact affected by ZnS loadings.The potentials of electrons and holes required for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 were the most suitable for the 3.1 wt. ZnS/MMT nanocomposite.All prepared ZnS/MMT nanocomposites exhibited higher efficiency in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction in comparison with the commercial TiO 2 Evonic P25.

With respect to potential application of developed ZnS/MMT nanocomposites in liquid systems, their stability was explored in our previous works 49,50, via their shaking in water for 24 h.The dispersions were filtered and the UV-vis absorption spectra of filtrates were recorded.There was not detected any typical absorption edge of ZnS nanoparticles at about 320 nm in absorption spectra which means that the ZnS nanoparticles were firmly attached to MMT likely located in its pores 49.The stability of ZnS/MMT nanocomposites was also confirmed by the derived mathematical model 50. Fig. 1a and b shows measured nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms and evaluated pore-size distributions of investigated ZnS/MMT nanocomposites.Textural properties are summarized in Table 1.The shapes of nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms of all ZnS/MMT nanocomposites correspond to porous materials possessing dominantly larger mesopores/macropores.In addition to that, it is evident from Fig. 1a that pristine MMT possesses besides large mesopores/macropores also a small portion of micropores (pores with diameter 2 nm, V micro 2 mm 3 liq /g).According to previous research 51, the missing smallest pores in all ZnS/MMT nanocomposites and decreasing nanocomposite specific surface area can be attributed to a plugging of some part of the MMT porous structure, evidently of micropores and smaller mesopores, by CTAB which was used for ZnS/MMT nanocomposites synthesis and whose presence was proved by the determined carbon content by using AAS and elemental analysis.It was reported that the specific surface area of MMT can diminish due to the plugging of MMT porous structure by CTAB up to 4.4 m 2 /g 51.This indicates that further strongly decreased specific surface area of the 4.2 wt. ZnS/MMT nanocomposite (0.9 m 2 /g) may be a result of the secondary effect-incorporation of ZnS nanoparticles and/or ZnS agglomerates to MMT meso-macroporous structure.This phenomenon corresponds to Fig. 1b where pores with diameter 13 nm are evidently disappearing with increasing loading of ZnS nanoparticles from 3.1 to 4.2 wt.. The XRD measurements were performed in order to reveal the crystal structure of ZnS nanoparticles and to determine the inter-planar distance of 0 0 1 planes (d 001 ) of MMT.The diffraction patterns for all the samples including pristine MMT are displayed in Fig. 2a.While the presence of crystalline quartz (trigonal SiO 2 , space group P3 2 21) can be clearly seen, ZnS in any common crystalline form (sphalerite-cubic, F4; -3m; wurtzite-hexagonal, P6 3 mc) cannot be proved.This observation might be caused either by very small ZnS crystallite size or due to small amounts of ZnS nanoparticles (2-4.2 wt.) in the ZnS/MMT nanocomposites since possible ZnS peaks may coincide with those coming from MMT or quartz. The diffraction maxima corresponding to d 001 planes in MMT are displayed in detail in Fig. 2b for all the samples.A shift of the 0 0 1 diffraction peaks corresponding to an increase of the inter-planar distance d 001 with increasing concentration of ZnS can be observed (Table 2).This effect can be explained by the presence of some carbon amounts (12-25 wt.) in all the ZnS/MMT nanocomposites, which come from CTAB used during the deposition of ZnS nanoparticles and is intercalated in the MMT interlayer and thus increases the d 001 distance of MMT.This feature also pretty correlates with the decreasing specific surface area of investigated nanocomposites in the order 2.0 wt. ZnS/MMT 3.1 wt. ZnS/MMT 4.2 wt. ZnS/MMT as a consequence of increasing carbon amounts 12, 19.4 and 25 wt., respectively.However, from Table 2 and Fig. 3 is evident that the change in the inter-planar distance d 001 of MMT at 3.1 wt. and 4.2 wt. ZnS loadings is not so substantial despite the significantly increased carbon amount (19.4 and 25 wt., respectively).It reveals that at 4.2 wt. of deposited ZnS the effect of CTAB intercalation to the MMT interlayer is comparable to that for 3.1 wt. of ZnS and thus the significantly decreased specific surface area of 4.2 wt. ZnS/MMT nanocomposite (0.9 m 2 /g) can be caused by plugging of MMT mesopores and macropores by additional CTAB as well as ZnS nanoparticles or their agglomerates, e.g. in the pore mouths.The observations from XRD pretty support the observations from nitrogen physisorption. The position of the 0 0 1 diffraction peak in MMT and corresponding inter-planar distances d001 with estimated errors.Arising from previous knowledge about possible agglomeration of ZnS nanoparticles stabilized by CTAB 52 and in order to support hypotheses about plugging of MMT porous structure also by ZnS nanoparticles/agglomerates, the TEM analysis of ZnS/MMT nanocomposites was performed as well.The TEM micrographs showing ZnS agglomerates of different sizes deposited on the external surface of MMT are shown in Fig. 4a andb.A detailed view of one ZnS agglomerate revealed that the agglomerates were composed of individual ZnS nanoparticles with sizes of about 20-40 nm.It is in contrast with determined gap energies (see below) corresponding to sizes equal and smaller than 10 nm when the quantum size effect occurs.This apparent disagreement indicates that ZnS nanoparticles of different sizes as well as agglomerated in large agglomerates with sizes of several hundred nanometers exist on MMT.Formation of agglomerates is key for understanding different photocatalytic efficiency discussed below. Since the same ZnS suspension was used for the preparation of all ZnS/MMT nanocomposites, the size of ZnS nanoparticles does not determine the differences between them.As reported in our previous study 28, ZnS nanoparticles and CTAB form agglomerates attached. The mean size of ZnS nanoparticles was estimated from their optical properties in a suspension, i.e. before they were deposited on MMT.The well described size-dependence of absorption spectra was considered and the effective mass approximation was utilized to obtain the size of ZnS nanoparticles from the following Brus equation 53: where E bg (bulk) and E bg (nano) are the band bap energies of bulk and nano-sized semiconductors, respectively, h is the Planck' constant, m e and m h are the effective masses of electron and hole, respectively, and is the dielectric constant of the material.Here, m e 0.42 m 0 and m h 0.61 m 0 , where m 0 is the free electron mass and the dielectric constant e 8.76 54.The band gap energy of ZnS nanoparticles was estimated from the linear part of the (h ) 0.5 versus (h ) plot as described in our previous work 28.Fig. 5 shows the UV-vis spectra of ZnS/MMT nanocomposites.The band gap energy of ZnS/MMT with 2.0 wt. of ZnS was 3.65 eV (Table 1).This value is close to that band gap energy reported for bulk ZnS (3.6-3.7 eV) 55.The band gap energy of ZnS/MMT increased with increasing concentration of ZnS up to 3.84 eV for 4.2 wt. ZnS/MMT.Previously, it has been reported that the increase in band gap energy is a result of reduction in the particle size of ZnS that is related to the quantum confinement effects 565758 a vacuum, is the dielectric constant for the ZnS (8.76), h is the Planck constant and e is the charge of an electron.Diameter (2R) of studied materials has been estimated to be 10.0 nm, 7.2 nm and 5.7 nm for ZnS/MMT with 2.0 wt., 3.1 wt. and 4.2 wt. of ZnS.The absolute values of ZnS particles calculated from UV-vis are affected by used E 0 value that has been reported to be 3.6-3.7 eV and the dielectric constant for the ZnS.This is probably a reason, why the absolute value of ZnS particles calculated from UV-vis is lower than those values determined from TEM.Nevertheless, it brings attractive connection between TEM and UV-vis results.It is surprising that the particle diameter of ZnS calculated from the band gap energy (Table 1) decreases with increasing ZnS loading.Moreover, it is in contrast to TEM results.This effect can be explained by clustering of ZnS particles with approximately of the same nano-size.While 2.0 wt. ZnS/MMT contains separated ZnS nanoparticles with approximately the same diameter of 20-40 nm (TEM-Fig.4a), 4.2 wt. ZnS/MMT contains both ZnS nanoparticles and ZnS agglomerates of micrometer-size composed of many of ZnS nanoparticles (TEM-Fig.4b).Based on that fact the decrease in the band gap energy can be associated with the dominant effect of the presence of higher amount of ZnS nanoparticles and lower amount of ZnS agglomerates. ZnS/MMT nanocomposites with different contents of ZnS were investigated for the photoreduction of CO 2 dissolved in NaOH solutions.The commercial TiO 2 Evonic P25 photocatalyst was examined as a reference for comparison.The effect of irradiation time on the formation of products was investigated over a period of 0-24 h.Fig. 6 shows the evolution of all reaction products as the functions of the irradiation for the 3.1 wt. ZnS/MMT nanocomposite.The main gaseous product was methane.Hydrogen and low amounts of carbon monoxide were also detected.Other products such as formic acid, formaldehyde, ethane and ethylene could also be formed 22,59, but they were undetectable in our GC configuration.The observed yields (mol/g cat ) order was: H 2 CH 4 CO. Comparisons of CH 4 , H 2 and CO yields over ZnS/MMT with different contents of ZnS are shown in Fig. 7a-c, respectively.A gradual increase of methane yield was observed after the start of irradiation with the exception of commercial TiO 2 catalyst.In this case the yields of methane were negligible during the first 8 h of irradiation.The highest yield of methane was observed for 3.1 wt. ZnS/MMT. In case of ZnS/MMT, the hydrogen yields continually increased during the whole experiments.In comparison with the application of commercial titanium dioxide, hydrogen was produced in 6-fold higher concentrations (Fig. 7b).The yields of carbon monoxide were increasing slowly during the reaction, but all yields were close to the limit of detection (Fig. 7c).The highest yield of both products was observed for 3.1 wt. ZnS/MMT. The data from the longest reaction time span were chosen for the overall comparison because the yields of all products were the highest and the most accurate.The results show that the photocatalytic performance of nanocomposites varies with the content of ZnS in the order of 3.1 wt. ZnS 4.2 wt. ZnS 2.0 wt. ZnS.All yields of products for ZnS/MMT nanocomposites were higher than those for the commercial photocatalyst Evonic P25.According to the blank test, the original montmorillonite does not possess any photocatalytic performance. Regarding the possible formation of reaction products in a consequence of some carbon content from CTAB presented, it is worth to mention that the formation of methane was already investigated with the developed type of nanocomposite within the blank experiments at various pH in our previous study 60.The generation of methane was observed, the effect of different pH on the methane yields was comparable.However, in our study the evolution of photocatalytic performance of ZnS/MMT nanocomposites does not follow the trend in increasing carbon content (within increasing ZnS loading), thus the determined trend in photocatalytic performance can be considered as not burdened with this fact and correct. One would assume that with increasing loading of ZnS nanoparticles, which is the only active component in the ZnS/MMT nanocomposites, the photocatalytic performance of investigated nanocomposites would escalate.However, this hypothesis was not confirmed.According to the blank test, the original montmorillonite does not possess any photocatalytic performance.Besides that, 4.2 wt. of ZnS on MMT does not assign the highest photocatalytic performance.The overall order of photocatalytic performance in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 was following: 3.1 wt. ZnS 4.2 wt. ZnS 2.0 wt. ZnS.It is evident that with higher content of ZnS the nanocomposite photocatalytic performance in the first instance increases, but then there is a decline.This indicates that probably besides the ZnS loading, also the degree of agglomeration of ZnS nanoparticles plays a key role.The agglomeration of ZnS nanoparticles increases with increasing ZnS loading as it is evident from the results of TEM and UV-vis and it could be correlated with the work function as follows.The work function is the minimum energy that must be given to an electron to liberate it from the surface of ZnS nanoparticle.If ZnS occurs on MMT as same-size nanoparticles in various ZnS loadings, the work function should be same.We suppose, if such ZnS nanoparticles agglomerate and the degree of their agglomeration is too high, the work function should be higher.In our case with increasing ZnS loading the nanoparticles agglomerate and the lowest work function is achieved for 3.1 wt. of ZnS in MMT, when ZnS is partially as separated nanoparticles and partially as agglomerates.This evidences the correlation between the degree of ZnS nanoparticles agglomeration and the work function.Fig. 8 shows the correlation between the yields of methane after 24 h of irradiation and the work function of each catalyst.It can be seen from Fig. 8 that the lowest electron work function corresponds to the most active catalyst.This observation is in agreement with our previous observations over cerium doped TiO 2 nanoparticulated photocatalysts in the same reaction 61 and corresponds to the reaction mechanism.The photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide is conducted via generated electrons and the 3.1 wt. ZnS/MMT nanocomposite releases those electrons most easily.Contrary to that, pristine montmorillonite shows no photocatalytic performance, corresponding nicely to very high electron work function. The valence band of sulfide semiconductors, made of 3p orbitals of the sulfur atoms, is shifted upwards compared with those of the oxide analogues, while the conduction band electrons are also more reductive 62.For the CO 2 photocatalytic reduction the electron energy in conduction band must be higher than H reduction potential and the hole energy in valence band must be lower than OH -oxidation potentials.ZnS is a direct wide band gap semiconductor (Eg 3.6 eV in the bulk) 63, hence it absorbs only in the UV range, but it possesses a strongly reducing conduction band (E CB -1.85V versus the NHE at pH 7) 64.The addition of ZnS to MMT should result in changing the band gap and the absorption edge energies can be expected and was also experimentally demonstrated (see Fig. 5).However, it is always difficult to predict separately the shift of conduction and valence band energies, which are extremely important with respect to required oxidation and reduction potentials. The work function for different ZnS contents shown in Fig. 8 can help us to elucidate the shifts of conduction as well as valence bands.For simplicity the Fermi level on nanoparticle surface is supposed to be pinned to the middle of the nanoparticle band gap.Deriving from Figs. 5 and8 and Table 1, we can estimate that the energy of electrons on the conduction band edge is -2.066 eV, while the valence band edge is -5.716 eV for 2.0 wt. ZnS/MMT (Fig. 9a).For 3.1 wt. ZnS/MMT the energy of electrons on the conduction band edge increases about approximately 134 meV, while the valence band edge shifts up by 54 meV.Further increase of ZnS content up to 4.2 wt. led only to a much smaller conduction band decrease (21 meV), whereas the valence band edge shifts down by 89 meV.These shifts are depicted in Fig. 9b.Higher levels of the conduction band are more effective for the creation of H ions which are necessary for CO 2 reduction.It can be concluded that for 3.1 wt. of ZnS the carriers have the most suitable potentials for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 . In summary: Since the optical and electronic properties of nanocomposites have been considered as key properties related to the mechanism of CO 2 photocatalytic reduction and there exist the correlation between the band gap energy, the nanoparticle work function and the degree of agglomeration of nanoparticles, the behavior of ZnS on nano-size level plays the determining role.The shift in conduction band and valence band energies of ZnS at different ZnS loadings is a consequence of different degree of ZnS nanoparticles agglomeration on MMT."}]}}
