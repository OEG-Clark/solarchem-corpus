CuO/Cu 2 O NWAs were fabricated by a simple thermal oxidation method.Copper foil (2 A 2 cm 2 ) was carefully cleaned with a 6.0 M HCl solution in an ultrasound bath for 30 min to remove the CuO layer from the surface, then rinsed with deionized water and absolute ethanol for several times, and nally dried in air naturally.The bare Cu foil was calcinated at 600 C in air for 4 h with a speed of 10 C min A1 to obtain CuO/Cu 2 O NWAs. CuO/Cu 2 O NWAsrGO was fabricated via a two-step selfassembly procedure.In that procedure, 30 mg reduced graphene oxide (rGO) was added into 300 mL of methanol, and aer being ultrasonically treated for 3 h, rGO was exfoliated into thin sheets and disintegrated into a homogeneous suspension.CuO/Cu 2 O NWAs grown on the Cu foil were then put on a platform which was hung in the suspension and the suspension was stirred at room temperature for 24 h.Finally, the obtained sample was collected and dried in a vacuum oven at 60 C. X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments were conducted on a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer (Bruker Optics, Ettlingen, Germany) with Cu-Ka radiation, operated at 40 kV and 40 mA (scanning step: 0.02 s A1 ) in 2q 14 10-80 .Scanning electron microscopy (TEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) experiments were conducted on a Tescan Vega3 scanning electron microscope (TESCAN Ltd., Czech) and a JEM-2010 transmission electron microscope (JEOL Ltd., Japan) at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV.X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were recorded on an ESCALAB 250 XPS meter (Thermo Scien-tic) with monochromized Al Ka irradiation at 250 W. Raman spectra were obtained with a Dilor LabRam-1B microscopic Raman Spectrum.Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) experiments were conducted on a VSP three-electrode electrochemical analysis system (Bio-logic Science Instruments, France) in 6 M KOH aqueous solutions and obtained at the frequency from 0.01 Hz to 100 kHz with amplitude of 5 mV.The products supported on copper foil (2 A 2 cm 2 ) were directly used as the working electrode without any binder or conductive additive.A Pt plate (2 A 2 cm 2 ) and an Ag/AgCl electrode were used as the counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. The photocatalytic experiments for CO 2 and H 2 O reduction were carried out using CuO/Cu 2 O NWAs and CuO/Cu 2 O NWAsrGO as the photocatalysts in a gas-closed circulation system with the volume of 2700 mL.For each test, 4 A 4 cm 2 catalyst was placed onto the stainless-steel lm which was xed in the center of reactor.A Xe arc lamp (500 W) with sunlike radiation spectrum was put at the top of quartz window with the distance of 8 cm.The circulated cooling water was used to keep the photoreactor at ambient temperature during the reaction.Before the illumination, the reactor was vacuumed and purged with the CO 2 and H 2 O mixture at about 20 mL min A1 for 2 h to establish an adsorption-desorption equilibrium.During the irradiation, the gas phase products were taken at a given time interval (1 h) for subsequent quantitative analysis of product by using an on-line gas chromatograph."}]}}
