Surface Platinization by TTS.The as-prepared TiO 2 thin films were transferred to an ATC 2000 V sputtering system (AJA International, Inc.).Platinum NPs were deposited using a TTS configuration with a target angle of 23.8, 6 in.target-substrate distance, 4 mTorr operating pressure, and a fixed deposition power of 30 W with a varying deposition time.The TiO 2 thin film samples were placed in the outer region of the deposition flux zone where lowenergy atoms took part in nanoparticle formation, thereby forming uniform ultrafine particles.The direct deposition method produces Pt NPs with diameters ranging from 0.5 to 2 nm for deposition times of 5-60 s (see Supporting Information, S1).The average particle size and particle number density were measured from the corresponding TEM images and summarized in Table 1. Thin Film Characterization.The morphology of the thin films was examined using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) (NOVA NanoSEM 230, FEI Co.) operated at 15 kV.Average film height and column (single crystal) diameter were estimated from the FE-SEM images.The morphology of the films was also evaluated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Dimension 3100 Nanoman, Veeco Instruments, Inc.).Elemental mapping of the films was characterized by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX).The inner structure of the films was analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (JEM-2100F, JEOL).The crystal phase was determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Geigerflex D-MAX/A, Rigaku Denki) using CuK radiation ( 1.548A).The optical properties of the thin films were measured by ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectroscopy (Cary 100, Varian Inc.) at room temperature.The Pt oxidation states before and after photoreduction were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (AXIS 165, Kratos Analytical) with monochromated aluminum as an anode operated at 150 W. Femtosecond Time-Resolved Transient Absorption (TA) Spectroscopy Measurements.The measurements were carried out using a femtosecond TA spectrometer (Helios, Ultrafast Systems) coupled to a femtosecond laser system consisting Solstice (Spectra-Physics) built of a Ti:sapphire regenerative amplifier (Spitfire Pro XP), a pulse stretcher and compressor, a femtosecond oscillator (Mai-Tai) as seeding source, and a diode-pumped solid-state pulsed green laser (Empower) as the pump source.The system produced pulses centered at 800 nm with energy of 3.5 mJ, 90 fs duration, and 1 kHz repetition rate.Ninety percent of the output beam was used to generate pump beam in an optical parametric amplifier (Topas-C with Berek extension) (Light Conversion Ltd.).The remaining 10 was used to produce probe pulses in the Helios spectrometer.A nearinfrared continuum probe was generated by a proprietary crystalloid plate.A 256 pixel InGaAs linear diode array was used as a detector.To provide an isotropic excitation of the sample and avoid pump-probe polarization effects, the pump beam was depolarized using depolarizer.The samples were excited at 365 nm with pump beam energy kept at low energies between 1 and 3 J.The excitation beam was focused to a spot size of 1 mm diameter corresponding to photon intensity of 2.34-7.04 10 14 photons/cm 2 .Detailed data analysis can be found in Supporting Information, S11. Photoreduction Analysis.The photoreduction analysis system is described in a previous paper. 7Compressed CO 2 was used as the carbon source.It passed through a water bubbler to generate a mixture of CO 2 and water vapor.The gaseous mixture was then fed into a continuous flow reactor where the films were loaded.The reactor is cylindrical in shape with a quartz window vertically facing the light source, which is a Xe lamp operated at 400 W with an accumulated intensity of 19.6 mW/cm 2 in the effective UV range (250-388 nm) (see Supporting Information, S4).Before each test, the reactor loaded with samples was first purged with CO 2 and water vapor at 100 mL/ min for 1 h, and then the flow rate was reduced and maintained at 3 mL/min during the whole analysis process.The concentrations of effluent gases as a function of irradiation time were recorded automatically by gas chromatography (GC) through an automated gas valve, using helium as the carrier gas.The GC was equipped with a PLOT capillary column (Supelco Carboxen-1010) and a thermal conductivity detector."}, {"llm generation": "Pt-TiO 2", "source": "The Pt-TiO 2 thin films were then subjected to CO 2 photoreduction analysis.", "context": "A representative Pt-TiO 2 thin film was characterized by FE-SEM, AFM, elemental mapping, TEM, XRD, and UV-vis (Figure 1).As shown in Figure 1a, the Pt-TiO 2 film has a highly oriented 1D structure with a typical column diameter of 250 nm, which significantly increases the effective surface area compared to a planar film, providing more active sites for photocatalytic reactions (see Supporting Information, S2 for an estimation of surface area of the columnar films).The highly oriented morphology of the film was also confirmed by AFM (Figure 1b), where the height was estimated to be around 1.5 m.Corresponding elemental mapping (Figure 1c) and TEM analysis (Figure 1d) confirm the presence of Pt NPs on the surface of TiO 2 single crystals.The high-resolution (HR)-TEM analysis reveals that the single crystals have an orientation of anatase (112) plane, and surface defects are also observed (Figure 1d inset).These defects or dislocations are the reason for oriented attachment of particles/molecules to form (112) orientation 18 and the active sites for Pt deposition. 16The high surface energy of the (112) plane is preferred since it can enhance the electron mobility and hence improve photocatalytic activity. 18,19As seen in Figure 1d, the Pt NPs are partially crystallized and have an average diameter of 1 nm.It should be noted that these are extremely small Pt NPs achievable only by gas-phase deposition using our unique sputtering method.The 1D structure of the TiO 2 single crystals was also analyzed by XRD (Figure 1e), where a prominent (112) peak was observed.The corresponding Lotgering's factor 20 was calculated to be 0.52, indicating high orientation of the (112) plane.The optical properties of the films (Figure 1f) are not influenced by Pt coating since the difference of absorbance between pristine TiO 2 and Pt-TiO 2 films in 200-300 nm (absorption region of Pt NPs) is not significant (see Supporting Information, S3, for details).The Pt-TiO 2 thin films were then subjected to CO 2 photoreduction analysis.Representative CO and methane (CH 4 ) yields of the film versus irradiation time were plotted (Figure 2a).The film demonstrated high selectivity to CH 4 formation.The CH 4 yield increased with irradiation time and reached a peak value of 1361 mol/g-cat/h at 5 h.The quantum yield at this condition was calculated to be 2.41 (see Supporting Information, S4, for calculation).To the best of our knowledge, this value is the highest CH 4 yield ever reported in the literature of photoreduction of CO 2 . 2345514,21 Hydrogen (H 2 ) could not be detected indicating that the amount evolved in this work was not significant and probably all reacted.It is also worth noting that the actual overall quantum yield of CO 2 photoreduction of the Pt-TiO 2 thin films could be even higher since only products with low molecular weights (MWs), such as CO and CH 4 signals, could be detected by the GC column that was used in this study.Signals of some other potential products with larger MWs, such as HCO 2 H, CH 2 O, and CH 3 OH, may be neglected as they are not probable to be formed.After 5 h of irradiation, CH 4 production rates started to drop slightly which can be attributed to deterioration of photocatalytic activity due to diminishment of the adsorption power of the catalyst 9 and the saturation of adsorption sites on the TiO 2 surface with intermediate products. 6,22Carbon monoxide formation was also observed but with a lower yield, and it ceased after 2.5 h of irradiation due to the selective formation of CH 4 based on a sixelectron reaction (see Supporting Information, SE6). 21It should also be noted the synthesis methodology of the nanostructures allows the rapid desorption of products, a desirable feature in such systems. 23o better understand the mechanistic pathway of CH 4 formation, two control experiments were performed (Figure 2a).These are especially important to rule out possibilities of contamination from other carbon sources, for example, from incomplete oxidation of TTIP during fabrication of the TiO 2 films or oil contamination from vacuum pumps during Pt decoration.First, the films were illuminated without introducing CO 2 as the carbon source, where N 2 was used as the carrier gas.If there was any reactive residual carbon, it would react with protons (H ) or H 2 generated based on competitive water splitting and form CH 4 .Neither CH 4 nor other carbon compounds were observed indicating that there was no residual carbon or other carbon contamination in the system.Another experiment was done by introducing CO 2 but without irradiation.Neither CH 4 nor CO was formed implying that TiO 2 is the only active catalyst.Volumetric ratio of O 2 /N 2 , which is another important indicator for proton generation, as a function of irradiation time also shows a very similar tendency as that of CH 4 formation (see Figure 2a).The highest O 2 /N 2 ratio was above 0.40 (higher than that of air, viz.0.26), implying adequate supply of protons (see Supporting Information, SE3).Since the Pt NPs trap electrons very effectively, the effect of Pt deposition was investigated in detail.Figure 2b illustrates the CO and CH 4 yields of Pt-TiO 2 films with different Pt deposition times.The comparison between the Pt-TiO 2 films with commercial TiO 2 powders (Degussa P25) and pristine TiO 2 films has also been made.Both pristine and Pt-TiO 2 films out-perform P25 powders.Pt-TiO 2 films demonstrated even superior performance, where the CH 4 yields in most cases were well above 400 mol/g-cat/h.The yield showed a sharp rise with a peak at a Pt deposition of 20 s.The relatively low CH 4 yield of the films with low Pt depositions is due to insufficient sites present to trap electrons.The XPS analysis also indicated that the Pt NPs under these conditions were partially oxidized to form Pt II (see Table 1 and Supporting Information, S5), serving as recombination centers. 13Beyond the optimal condition (20 s deposition time), the Pt-TiO 2 films also demonstrated lower CH 4 yields.It is commonly known that with increasing Pt depositions the active surface sites of TiO 2 were blocked and hence resulted in lower performance.By careful TEM examination on the Pt-TiO 2 films, we found that it should not be the only reason since even for Pt deposition for 60 s, there are still plenty of surface sites on TiO 2 films (see Supporting Information, S6).Detailed photoreduction results are also summarized in Table 1. To elucidate the understanding of this trend, the particle size analysis was performed based on the TEM observations.The results show that the Pt size increased with deposition time, from 0.5 nm at 5 s to 1.87 nm at 60 s of deposition times (see Table 1 and Supporting Information, S7).At very short deposition times, Pt NPs are extremely small and possibly have higher energy band separation due to quantum confinement, preventing electron transfer from the TiO 2 conduction band (CB) to Pt. 12 But electrons can transfer freely to Pt NPs with an energy level lower than -4.4 eV (the lower energy level of the TiO 2 CB).As Pt NPs become larger, their properties may be approaching that of bulk Pt, capturing both photoelectrons and holes and acting as recombination centers. 12,24Therefore, the optimal size of Pt NPs is that with energy bands positioned between -4.4 and -5.65 eV (work function of bulk Pt, see Figure 3 and Supporting Information, S8, for details).It should be noted that the particle number densities of the Pt NPs were kept constant (around 5 10 12 no./cm 2 ) at various deposition times in this work (see Table 1), with least contribution to the decrease of charge carrier separation distance (CCSD), which is the reason for the increase of electron-hole recombination rates. 24Thus it can be concluded that the Pt particle size plays an important role in the CO 2 photoreduction process.In this work, the optimal size was found to be around 1 nm, which is not readily achieved and controlled using liquid phase and other synthesis methods.Our methodology of angular RF sputtering method is promising and powerful.Although not exactly the same, gold NPs showed a similar size effect on the Fermi level equilibration of semiconductors, where smaller gold NPs can shift the Fermi level of TiO 2 to more negative potentials, resulting in enhanced photocatalytic performance. 25he CO 2 photoreduction mechanism of the Pt-TiO 2 nanostructured films is schematically shown in Figure 3.The extremely high photoreduction efficiency of the films is believed due to the synergistic effects of high surface area and minimized charge barriers by oriented single-phase crystallinity of the film and efficient electron-hole separation by the Pt NPs, as discussed above.Similar enhancement of CO 2 photoreduction efficiency was also achieved by Pt-TiO 2 nanotube arrays, where the Pt NPs were deposited on the TiO 2 nanotubes by using a rapid microwave-assisted solvothermal approach. 26he mechanism of CO 2 photoreduction is actually complex.Most researchers agree that this process is based on protonassisted multielectron transfer (MET) instead of single electron transfer, as the electrochemical potential of -2.14 V vs SCE for a single electron process is highly unfavorable. 27Depending on the number of electrons and protons, the formation products can be different.Carbon monoxide is formed by reacting with two protons and two electrons, while CH 4 formation needs eight electrons and eight protons (see Supporting Information, S9, for details).The selective formation of CH 4 rather than CO is owing to the compromise between charge transfer and thermodynamics.The formation of CH 4 (E redox /SCE -0.48V) is thermodynamically more feasible than the formation of CO (E redox /SCE -0.77V) if the supply of protons and electrons is high enough. 27Carbon monoxide was mainly obtained in many previous studies possibly due to the paucity of electrons.In this work, more electrons and protons were available.These electrons first reside on the Pt NPs and are then transferred rapidly from Pt to the absorbed CO 2 vapor for photoreduction (see Figure 3). 28Our previous research revealed a similar phenomenon that Cu-doping could enhance the selectivity of CH 4 formation, as Cu species acting as electron traps resulted in an increased probability of multielectron reactions. 6Methane can also be formed by the depletion of CO following the six-electron reaction (Supporting Information, SE6) as seen in Figure 2b, 21 which also supports the selective formation of CH 4 .Thermal effects are negligible in this work.The depletion of CO followed by oxidation with oxygen over the Pt surface is negligible in this work (see Supporting Information, S9), since the system was operated at atmospheric pressure and room temperature (Supporting Information, S10).Under these conditions, the chemisorption of both CO and O 2 on Pt surface is very weak, and the reaction rate is generally very slow. 29o further understand the charge carrier transfer dynamics, femtosecond time-resolved TA spectroscopy measurements were performed for both TiO 2 and Pt-TiO 2 samples with special focus on subnano-and nanosecond time range.Dependency of the electron-hole pair recombination rate constant (k obs ) on the pair concentration for both TiO 2 and Pt-TiO 2 films is shown in Figure 4.In both cases charge recombination rates are dependent on the excitation intensity (electron-hole pair concentration), and the observed trends can be fitted by linear functions.It is apparent that the linear fitting of the Pt-TiO 2 film has a gentler slope compared to its TiO 2 counterpart, indicating that the charge recombination process is slower for Pt-TiO 2 .This is the direct evidence of Ptdriven suppression of the charge recombination process 30 in the Pt-TiO 2 sample, which is similar to that of Au-TiO 2 . 25nother evidence is that the linear fits converge to the same value of intrinsic electron-hole recombination rate constant (k rec 0.22 10 9 s -1 or rec 4.5 ns, Supporting Information, S11) if they are extrapolated to absorbance difference (A) of zero.This is a hypothetical situation when charge recombination process is independent of electron-hole pair concentration and can be assumed as photogeneration of only one electron-hole pair per TiO 2 particle.The probability that a single electron is scavenged by Pt NPs instead of trapping in TiO 2 is very small, and therefore no difference should be observed between both samples."}, {"llm generation": "TiO2", "source": "In conclusion, we developed

mapping, TEM, XRD, and UV-vis (Figure 1).", "context": "A representative Pt-TiO 2 thin film was characterized by FE-SEM, AFM, elemental mapping, TEM, XRD, and UV-vis (Figure 1).As shown in Figure 1a, the Pt-TiO 2 film has a highly oriented 1D structure with a typical column diameter of 250 nm, which significantly increases the effective surface area compared to a planar film, providing more active sites for photocatalytic reactions (see Supporting Information, S2 for an estimation of surface area of the columnar films).The highly oriented morphology of the film was also confirmed by AFM (Figure 1b), where the height was estimated to be around 1.5 m.Corresponding elemental mapping (Figure 1c) and TEM analysis (Figure 1d) confirm the presence of Pt NPs on the surface of TiO 2 single crystals.The high-resolution (HR)-TEM analysis reveals that the single crystals have an orientation of anatase (112) plane, and surface defects are also observed (Figure 1d inset).These defects or dislocations are the reason for oriented attachment of particles/molecules to form (112) orientation 18 and the active sites for Pt deposition. 16The high surface energy of the (112) plane is preferred since it can enhance the electron mobility and hence improve photocatalytic activity. 18,19As seen in Figure 1d, the Pt NPs are partially crystallized and have an average diameter of 1 nm.It should be noted that these are extremely small Pt NPs achievable only by gas-phase deposition using our unique sputtering method.The 1D structure of the TiO 2 single crystals was also analyzed by XRD (Figure 1e), where a prominent (112) peak was observed.The corresponding Lotgering's factor 20 was calculated to be 0.52, indicating high orientation of the (112) plane.The optical properties of the films (Figure 1f) are not influenced by Pt coating since the difference of absorbance between pristine TiO 2 and Pt-TiO 2 films in 200-300 nm (absorption region of Pt NPs) is not significant (see Supporting Information, S3, for details).The Pt-TiO 2 thin films were then subjected to CO 2 photoreduction analysis.Representative CO and methane (CH 4 ) yields of the film versus irradiation time were plotted (Figure 2a).The film demonstrated high selectivity to CH 4 formation.The CH 4 yield increased with irradiation time and reached a peak value of 1361 mol/g-cat/h at 5 h.The quantum yield at this condition was calculated to be 2.41 (see Supporting Information, S4, for calculation).To the best of our knowledge, this value is the highest CH 4 yield ever reported in the literature of photoreduction of CO 2 . 2345514,21 Hydrogen (H 2 ) could not be detected indicating that the amount evolved in this work was not significant and probably all reacted.It is also worth noting that the actual overall quantum yield of CO 2 photoreduction of the Pt-TiO 2 thin films could be even higher since only products with low molecular weights (MWs), such as CO and CH 4 signals, could be detected by the GC column that was used in this study.Signals of some other potential products with larger MWs, such as HCO 2 H, CH 2 O, and CH 3 OH, may be neglected as they are not probable to be formed.After 5 h of irradiation, CH 4 production rates started to drop slightly which can be attributed to deterioration of photocatalytic activity due to diminishment of the adsorption power of the catalyst 9 and the saturation of adsorption sites on the TiO 2 surface with intermediate products. 6,22Carbon monoxide formation was also observed but with a lower yield, and it ceased after 2.5 h of irradiation due to the selective formation of CH 4 based on a sixelectron reaction (see Supporting Information, SE6). 21It should also be noted the synthesis methodology of the nanostructures allows the rapid desorption of products, a desirable feature in such systems. 23o better understand the mechanistic pathway of CH 4 formation, two control experiments were performed (Figure 2a).These are especially important to rule out possibilities of contamination from other carbon sources, for example, from incomplete oxidation of TTIP during fabrication of the TiO 2 films or oil contamination from vacuum pumps during Pt decoration.First, the films were illuminated without introducing CO 2 as the carbon source, where N 2 was used as the carrier gas.If there was any reactive residual carbon, it would react with protons (H ) or H 2 generated based on competitive water splitting and form CH 4 .Neither CH 4 nor other carbon compounds were observed indicating that there was no residual carbon or other carbon contamination in the system.Another experiment was done by introducing CO 2 but without irradiation.Neither CH 4 nor CO was formed implying that TiO 2 is the only active catalyst.Volumetric ratio of O 2 /N 2 , which is another important indicator for proton generation, as a function of irradiation time also shows a very similar tendency as that of CH 4 formation (see Figure 2a).The highest O 2 /N 2 ratio was above 0.40 (higher than that of air, viz.0.26), implying adequate supply of protons (see Supporting Information, SE3).Since the Pt NPs trap electrons very effectively, the effect of Pt deposition was investigated in detail.Figure 2b illustrates the CO and CH 4 yields of Pt-TiO 2 films with different Pt deposition times.The comparison between the Pt-TiO 2 films with commercial TiO 2 powders (Degussa P25) and pristine TiO 2 films has also been made.Both pristine and Pt-TiO 2 films out-perform P25 powders.Pt-TiO 2 films demonstrated even superior performance, where the CH 4 yields in most cases were well above 400 mol/g-cat/h.The yield showed a sharp rise with a peak at a Pt deposition of 20 s.The relatively low CH 4 yield of the films with low Pt depositions is due to insufficient sites present to trap electrons.The XPS analysis also indicated that the Pt NPs under these conditions were partially oxidized to form Pt II (see Table 1 and Supporting Information, S5), serving as recombination centers. 13Beyond the optimal condition (20 s deposition time), the Pt-TiO 2 films also demonstrated lower CH 4 yields.It is commonly known that with increasing Pt depositions the active surface sites of TiO 2 were blocked and hence resulted in lower performance.By careful TEM examination on the Pt-TiO 2 films, we found that it should not be the only reason since even for Pt deposition for 60 s, there are still plenty of surface sites on TiO 2 films (see Supporting Information, S6).Detailed photoreduction results are also summarized in Table 1. To elucidate the understanding of this trend, the particle size analysis was performed based on the TEM observations.The results show that the Pt size increased with deposition time, from 0.5 nm at 5 s to 1.87 nm at 60 s of deposition times (see Table 1 and Supporting Information, S7).At very short deposition times, Pt NPs are extremely small and possibly have higher energy band separation due to quantum confinement, preventing electron transfer from the TiO 2 conduction band (CB) to Pt. 12 But electrons can transfer freely to Pt NPs with an energy level lower than -4.4 eV (the lower energy level of the TiO 2 CB).As Pt NPs become larger, their properties may be approaching that of bulk Pt, capturing both photoelectrons and holes and acting as recombination centers. 12,24Therefore, the optimal size of Pt NPs is that with energy bands positioned between -4.4 and -5.65 eV (work function of bulk Pt, see Figure 3 and Supporting Information, S8, for details).It should be noted that the particle number densities of the Pt NPs were kept constant (around 5 10 12 no./cm 2 ) at various deposition times in this work (see Table 1), with least contribution to the decrease of charge carrier separation distance (CCSD), which is the reason for the increase of electron-hole recombination rates. 24Thus it can be concluded that the Pt particle size plays an important role in the CO 2 photoreduction process.In this work, the optimal size was found to be around 1 nm, which is not readily achieved and controlled using liquid phase and other synthesis methods.Our methodology of angular RF sputtering method is promising and powerful.Although not exactly the same, gold NPs showed a similar size effect on the Fermi level equilibration of semiconductors, where smaller gold NPs can shift the Fermi level of TiO 2 to more negative potentials, resulting in enhanced photocatalytic performance. 25he CO 2 photoreduction mechanism of the Pt-TiO 2 nanostructured films is schematically shown in Figure 3.The extremely high photoreduction efficiency of the films is believed due to the synergistic effects of high surface area and minimized charge barriers by oriented single-phase crystallinity of the film and efficient electron-hole separation by the Pt NPs, as discussed above.Similar enhancement of CO 2 photoreduction efficiency was also achieved by Pt-TiO 2 nanotube arrays, where the Pt NPs were deposited on the TiO 2 nanotubes by using a rapid microwave-assisted solvothermal approach. 26he mechanism of CO 2 photoreduction is actually complex.Most researchers agree that this process is based on protonassisted multielectron transfer (MET) instead of single electron transfer, as the electrochemical potential of -2.14 V vs SCE for a single electron process is highly unfavorable. 27Depending on the number of electrons and protons, the formation products can be different.Carbon monoxide is formed by reacting with two protons and two electrons, while CH 4 formation needs eight electrons and eight protons (see Supporting Information, S9, for details).The selective formation of CH 4 rather than CO is owing to the compromise between charge transfer and thermodynamics.The formation of CH 4 (E redox /SCE -0.48V) is thermodynamically more feasible than the formation of CO (E redox /SCE -0.77V) if the supply of protons and electrons is high enough. 27Carbon monoxide was mainly obtained in many previous studies possibly due to the paucity of electrons.In this work, more electrons and protons were available.These electrons first reside on the Pt NPs and are then transferred rapidly from Pt to the absorbed CO 2 vapor for photoreduction (see Figure 3). 28Our previous research revealed a similar phenomenon that Cu-doping could enhance the selectivity of CH 4 formation, as Cu species acting as electron traps resulted in an increased probability of multielectron reactions. 6Methane can also be formed by the depletion of CO following the six-electron reaction (Supporting Information, SE6) as seen in Figure 2b, 21 which also supports the selective formation of CH 4 .Thermal effects are negligible in this work.The depletion of CO followed by oxidation with oxygen over the Pt surface is negligible in this work (see Supporting Information, S9), since the system was operated at atmospheric pressure and room temperature (Supporting Information, S10).Under these conditions, the chemisorption of both CO and O 2 on Pt surface is very weak, and the reaction rate is generally very slow. 29o further understand the charge carrier transfer dynamics, femtosecond time-resolved TA spectroscopy measurements were performed for both TiO 2 and Pt-TiO 2 samples with special focus on subnano-and nanosecond time range.Dependency of the electron-hole pair recombination rate constant (k obs ) on the pair concentration for both TiO 2 and Pt-TiO 2 films is shown in Figure 4.In both cases charge recombination rates are dependent on the excitation intensity (electron-hole pair concentration), and the observed trends can be fitted by linear functions.It is apparent that the linear fitting of the Pt-TiO 2 film has a gentler slope compared to its TiO 2 counterpart, indicating that the charge recombination process is slower for Pt-TiO 2 .This is the direct evidence of Ptdriven suppression of the charge recombination process 30 in the Pt-TiO 2 sample, which is similar to that of Au-TiO 2 . 25nother evidence is that the linear fits converge to the same value of intrinsic electron-hole recombination rate constant (k rec 0.22 10 9 s -1 or rec 4.5 ns, Supporting Information, S11) if they are extrapolated to absorbance difference (A) of zero.This is a hypothetical situation when charge recombination process is independent of electron-hole pair concentration and can be assumed as photogeneration of only one electron-hole pair per TiO 2 particle.The probability that a single electron is scavenged by Pt NPs instead of trapping in TiO 2 is very small, and therefore no difference should be observed between both samples."}, {"llm generation": "Fixed-bed", "source": "Characterization of a

syn gas and is used in the chemical industry to catalytically produce large number of products.The high surface area and single crystallinity of the unique 1D structure of the films and the efficient electron-hole separation by the Pt NPs were considered as the main reasons attributable for the enhancement.The low cost, scalable methodology illustrated for the design of functional photocatalysts with tailored morphologies can also be used for other reaction pathways and the synthesis of other catalytic materials.

mol/g-cat/h at 5 h.", "context": "A representative Pt-TiO 2 thin film was characterized by FE-SEM, AFM, elemental mapping, TEM, XRD, and UV-vis (Figure 1).As shown in Figure 1a, the Pt-TiO 2 film has a highly oriented 1D structure with a typical column diameter of 250 nm, which significantly increases the effective surface area compared to a planar film, providing more active sites for photocatalytic reactions (see Supporting Information, S2 for an estimation of surface area of the columnar films).The highly oriented morphology of the film was also confirmed by AFM (Figure 1b), where the height was estimated to be around 1.5 m.Corresponding elemental mapping (Figure 1c) and TEM analysis (Figure 1d) confirm the presence of Pt NPs on the surface of TiO 2 single crystals.The high-resolution (HR)-TEM analysis reveals that the single crystals have an orientation of anatase (112) plane, and surface defects are also observed (Figure 1d inset).These defects or dislocations are the reason for oriented attachment of particles/molecules to form (112) orientation 18 and the active sites for Pt deposition. 16The high surface energy of the (112) plane is preferred since it can enhance the electron mobility and hence improve photocatalytic activity. 18,19As seen in Figure 1d, the Pt NPs are partially crystallized and have an average diameter of 1 nm.It should be noted that these are extremely small Pt NPs achievable only by gas-phase deposition using our unique sputtering method.The 1D structure of the TiO 2 single crystals was also analyzed by XRD (Figure 1e), where a prominent (112) peak was observed.The corresponding Lotgering's factor 20 was calculated to be 0.52, indicating high orientation of the (112) plane.The optical properties of the films (Figure 1f) are not influenced by Pt coating since the difference of absorbance between pristine TiO 2 and Pt-TiO 2 films in 200-300 nm (absorption region of Pt NPs) is not significant (see Supporting Information, S3, for details).The Pt-TiO 2 thin films were then subjected to CO 2 photoreduction analysis.Representative CO and methane (CH 4 ) yields of the film versus irradiation time were plotted (Figure 2a).The film demonstrated high selectivity to CH 4 formation.The CH 4 yield increased with irradiation time and reached a peak value of 1361 mol/g-cat/h at 5 h.The quantum yield at this condition was calculated to be 2.41 (see Supporting Information, S4, for calculation).To the best of our knowledge, this value is the highest CH 4 yield ever reported in the literature of photoreduction of CO 2 . 2345514,21 Hydrogen (H 2 ) could not be detected indicating that the amount evolved in this work was not significant and probably all reacted.It is also worth noting that the actual overall quantum yield of CO 2 photoreduction of the Pt-TiO 2 thin films could be even higher since only products with low molecular weights (MWs), such as CO and CH 4 signals, could be detected by the GC column that was used in this study.Signals of some other potential products with larger MWs, such as HCO 2 H, CH 2 O, and CH 3 OH, may be neglected as they are not probable to be formed.After 5 h of irradiation, CH 4 production rates started to drop slightly which can be attributed to deterioration of photocatalytic activity due to diminishment of the adsorption power of the catalyst 9 and the saturation of adsorption sites on the TiO 2 surface with intermediate products. 6,22Carbon monoxide formation was also observed but with a lower yield, and it ceased after 2.5 h of irradiation due to the selective formation of CH 4 based on a sixelectron reaction (see Supporting Information, SE6). 21It should also be noted the synthesis methodology of the nanostructures allows the rapid desorption of products, a desirable feature in such systems. 23o better understand the mechanistic pathway of CH 4 formation, two control experiments were performed (Figure 2a).These are especially important to rule out possibilities of contamination from other carbon sources, for example, from incomplete oxidation of TTIP during fabrication of the TiO 2 films or oil contamination from vacuum pumps during Pt decoration.First, the films were illuminated without introducing CO 2 as the carbon source, where N 2 was used as the carrier gas.If there was any reactive residual carbon, it would react with protons (H ) or H 2 generated based on competitive water splitting and form CH 4 .Neither CH 4 nor other carbon compounds were observed indicating that there was no residual carbon or other carbon contamination in the system.Another experiment was done by introducing CO 2 but without irradiation.Neither CH 4 nor CO was formed implying that TiO 2 is the only active catalyst.Volumetric ratio of O 2 /N 2 , which is another important indicator for proton generation, as a function of irradiation time also shows a very similar tendency as that of CH 4 formation (see Figure 2a).The highest O 2 /N 2 ratio was above 0.40 (higher than that of air, viz.0.26), implying adequate supply of protons (see Supporting Information, SE3).Since the Pt NPs trap electrons very effectively, the effect of Pt deposition was investigated in detail.Figure 2b illustrates the CO and CH 4 yields of Pt-TiO 2 films with different Pt deposition times.The comparison between the Pt-TiO 2 films with commercial TiO 2 powders (Degussa P25) and pristine TiO 2 films has also been made.Both pristine and Pt-TiO 2 films out-perform P25 powders.Pt-TiO 2 films demonstrated even superior performance, where the CH 4 yields in most cases were well above 400 mol/g-cat/h.The yield showed a sharp rise with a peak at a Pt deposition of 20 s.The relatively low CH 4 yield of the films with low Pt depositions is due to insufficient sites present to trap electrons.The XPS analysis also indicated that the Pt NPs under these conditions were partially oxidized to form Pt II (see Table 1 and Supporting Information, S5), serving as recombination centers. 13Beyond the optimal condition (20 s deposition time), the Pt-TiO 2 films also demonstrated lower CH 4 yields.It is commonly known that with increasing Pt depositions the active surface sites of TiO 2 were blocked and hence resulted in lower performance.By careful TEM examination on the Pt-TiO 2 films, we found that it should not be the only reason since even for Pt deposition for 60 s, there are still plenty of surface sites on TiO 2 films (see Supporting Information, S6).Detailed photoreduction results are also summarized in Table 1. To elucidate the understanding of this trend, the particle size analysis was performed based on the TEM observations.The results show that the Pt size increased with deposition time, from 0.5 nm at 5 s to 1.87 nm at 60 s of deposition times (see Table 1 and Supporting Information, S7).At very short deposition times, Pt NPs are extremely small and possibly have higher energy band separation due to quantum confinement, preventing electron transfer from the TiO 2 conduction band (CB) to Pt. 12 But electrons can transfer freely to Pt NPs with an energy level lower than -4.4 eV (the lower energy level of the TiO 2 CB).As Pt NPs become larger, their properties may be approaching that of bulk Pt, capturing both photoelectrons and holes and acting as recombination centers. 12,24Therefore, the optimal size of Pt NPs is that with energy bands positioned between -4.4 and -5.65 eV (work function of bulk Pt, see Figure 3 and Supporting Information, S8, for details).It should be noted that the particle number densities of the Pt NPs were kept constant (around 5 10 12 no./cm 2 ) at various deposition times in this work (see Table 1), with least contribution to the decrease of charge carrier separation distance (CCSD), which is the reason for the increase of electron-hole recombination rates. 24Thus it can be concluded that the Pt particle size plays an important role in the CO 2 photoreduction process.In this work, the optimal size was found to be around 1 nm, which is not readily achieved and controlled using liquid phase and other synthesis methods.Our methodology of angular RF sputtering method is promising and powerful.Although not exactly the same, gold NPs showed a similar size effect on the Fermi level equilibration of semiconductors, where smaller gold NPs can shift the Fermi level of TiO 2 to more negative potentials, resulting in enhanced photocatalytic performance. 25he CO 2 photoreduction mechanism of the Pt-TiO 2 nanostructured films is schematically shown in Figure 3.The extremely high photoreduction efficiency of the films is believed due to the synergistic effects of high surface area and minimized charge barriers by oriented single-phase crystallinity of the film and efficient electron-hole separation by the Pt NPs, as discussed above.Similar enhancement of CO 2 photoreduction efficiency was also achieved by Pt-TiO 2 nanotube arrays, where the Pt NPs were deposited on the TiO 2 nanotubes by using a rapid microwave-assisted solvothermal approach. 26he mechanism of CO 2 photoreduction is actually complex.Most researchers agree that this process is based on protonassisted multielectron transfer (MET) instead of single electron transfer, as the electrochemical potential of -2.14 V vs SCE for a single electron process is highly unfavorable. 27Depending on the number of electrons and protons, the formation products can be different.Carbon monoxide is formed by reacting with two protons and two electrons, while CH 4 formation needs eight electrons and eight protons (see Supporting Information, S9, for details).The selective formation of CH 4 rather than CO is owing to the compromise between charge transfer and thermodynamics.The formation of CH 4 (E redox /SCE -0.48V) is thermodynamically more feasible than the formation of CO (E redox /SCE -0.77V) if the supply of protons and electrons is high enough. 27Carbon monoxide was mainly obtained in many previous studies possibly due to the paucity of electrons.In this work, more electrons and protons were available.These electrons first reside on the Pt NPs and are then transferred rapidly from Pt to the absorbed CO 2 vapor for photoreduction (see Figure 3). 28Our previous research revealed a similar phenomenon that Cu-doping could enhance the selectivity of CH 4 formation, as Cu species acting as electron traps resulted in an increased probability of multielectron reactions. 6Methane can also be formed by the depletion of CO
