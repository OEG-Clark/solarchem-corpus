Crystal phase composition of the materials was determined by XRD measurements (Figure 1).Anatase was the only crystalline phase of TiO2 identified in all samples. No signals attributed to CuO or PdO phases were detected for 2Cu, 5Cu, 0.5Pd and 1Pd samples, due to the high dispersion and low metal content present in the materials.The catalysts with the highest Cu or Pd content showed also a small peak at about 36 and 33, attributed to the reflection of CuO (Etefagh et al., 2013) and PdO (Mohajeri et al., 2010), respectively. In the case of Ru/TiO2 RuO2 peaks at about 28 and 35 (Debecker et al., 2014) are visible for the samples 1.7Ru and 3.7Ru.Anatase crystallite size of the catalysts was evaluated from XRD analysis, using the Scherrer equation (Table 1).For bare TiO2 the anatase crystallite size was about 7 nm and increased after the active phase deposition. Tests carried out in the absence of UV light evidenced that no reaction occurred in dark conditions.The UV-irradiation of photocatalysts in the presence of a mixture of CO2 and H2O led to the evolution of CH4 as main product, as well as trace amounts of CO.No deactivation phenomena were observed during the irradiation time. The influence of H2O/CO2 feeding ratio on methane formation rate is reported in Figure 2.For all the tested catalysts (except for 0.5Pd sample) CH4 production increased with the increase of H2O/CO2 feeding ratio.At fixed H2O/CO2 ratio photocatalytic activity decreased by increasing the metal loading.This last result could be explained considering that the formation of CuO, RuO2 and PdO crystallites segregated on TiO2 surface occurred with the increase of active phase loading, indicating a worsening of metal dispersion, as shown by XRD results (Figure 1).This phenomenon is responsible for the lowering of photocatalytic activity, as previously observed in other gas-phase photocatalytic reactions (Ciambelli et al., 2008).Figure 2 shows hat the catalyst containing 1 wt Pd yields the highest CH4 production rate with respect to the others Me/TiO2 samples. The specific photocatalytic activities for the formation of CH4 in the steady state conditions, for H2O/CO24, are summarized in Figure 3.In the case of Cu/TiO2 and Ru/TiO2 samples the formation of CH4 was lower than TiO2 alone.Moreover photo-catalytic activity decreased by increasing Cu or Ru content (as previously observed in Figure 2).The behavior was completely different when Pd was used as active phase.In this case, it is evident the existence of an optimal Pd loading.In the case of 1Pd and 1.5Pd CH4 formation rate was higher than that obtained on bare TiO2, whereas on 0.5Pd photocatalyst a value very similar to TiO2 was achieved.A marked increase in the CH4 formation rate, up to a value of about 64 mol g -1 h -1 , was found, when Pd load was equal to 1 wt., which is therefore the optimal active Pd loading.The photoreactivity reached on 1Pd sample is also significantly higher than that found in the current literature on gas-solid photocatalytic systems for the photoreduction of CO2 (Anpo et al., 1995)."}, {"llm generation": "Pd supported on titania (Pd/TiO2), TiO2, Cu/TiO2, Ru/TiO2", "source": "It was identified a class of photocatalysts based on the use of Pd supported on titania.", "context": "Several photocatalysts active in the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to methane, were prepared and tested.Operating conditions were optimized to obtain the maximum photoreactivity in a photocatalytic fluidized bed reactor with high illumination efficiency.It was identified a class of photocatalysts based on the use of Pd supported on titania.When Pd load was equal to 1 wt., CH4 photoproduction was 64 mol g -1 h -1 , higher than that achieved with TiO2 alone (about 15 mol g -1 h -1 ).The photoreactivity obtained with Pd/TiO2 is significantly higher than that found in the current literature on gas-solid photocatalytic systems for the photoreduction of CO2.The proper formulation of the photocatalyst, together with an optimized configuration of the photoreactor, can therefore effectively allow the photocatalytic conversion of CO2, reducing the environmental impact and transforming it in chemical products with high added value in mild reaction conditions.

Crystal phase composition of the materials was determined by XRD measurements (Figure 1).Anatase was the only crystalline phase of TiO2 identified in all samples. No signals attributed to CuO or PdO phases were detected for 2Cu, 5Cu, 0.5Pd and 1Pd samples, due to the high dispersion and low metal content present in the materials.The catalysts with the highest Cu or Pd content showed also a small peak at about 36 and 33, attributed to the reflection of CuO (Etefagh et al., 2013) and PdO (Mohajeri et al., 2010), respectively.

Tests carried out in the absence of UV light evidenced that no reaction occurred in dark conditions.The UV-irradiation of photocatalysts in the presence of a mixture of CO2 and H2O led to the evolution of CH4 as main product, as well as trace amounts of CO.No deactivation phenomena were observed during the irradiation time.
