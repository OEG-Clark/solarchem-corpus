XRD analysis was conducted to investigate the crystallinity of the as-synthesized CTF-1 and NCTF-1.As shown in Figure 2a, after the treatment of CTF-1 with hydrazine hydrate, the typical peak located at around 26.9 o , which was attributed to the interlayer-stacking structure, showed an obvious decrease, indicating that CTF-1 subjected to hydrothermal treatment could result in a dramatic exfoliation of the layered crystal structure. 3435536 Meanwhile, the typical peaks assigned to the oligomer 37 disappeared, which could be ascribed to the cyclocondensations of hydrazine and residual nitrile groups in the oligomers, forming a conjugated structure. 38The FTIR spectra of CTF-1 and NCTF-1 samples, as depicted in Figure S2, displayed similar characteristic profiles.The peaks at approximately 1357 and 1508 cm -1 arose from the stretching of the triazine ring. 39Similarly, the signals in NMR spectra of both samples (Figure 2b) were associated with carbon atoms in benzene rings (138 and 128 ppm) and triazine units (170 ppm). 39,40These results collectively indicated that N doping did not significantly alter the structure of CTF-1. XPS analysis was adopted to examine the elemental and chemical state aspects of the samples.As expected, the total N and C contents (atomic percentage) of CTF-1 and NCTF-1 were estimated from the ratio of the integrated peak areas and are depicted in Table S1.The high-resolution spectrum of N 1s in NCTF-1 could be deconvoluted into two peaks at 398.8 and 400.2 eV, corresponding to the sp 2 -hybridized nitrogen in pyridinic-N (CN-C) and pyrrolic-N (N-(C) 3 or C-NH-C), 41 respectively.Both these compositions could serve as Lewis basic sites and may play important roles in the CO 2 capture process. 42As illustrated in Figure 2d, the C 1s spectrum of CTF-1 could be resolved into three peaks centered at 284.6, 286.7, and 288.2 eV, which could be attributed to the graphite-like sp 2 C-C bond, C-N bond, and N-CN bond, respectively. 28,43After the introduction of N, the increased intensity of the C-N bond at 286.7 V is observed, implying the successful introduction of N into the framework of CTF-1.Considering the electronegativity of C and N, a relatively higher N content in NCTF-1 would increase the percentage of ionicity, leading to a higher electron density around the framework. Notably, the peak corresponding to pyridinic-N in NCTF-1 showed an obvious shift toward lower binding energy compared to that in CTF-1, implying that the electron density around the N atoms in the triazine rings of NCTF-1 increased.This suggested that the local chemical environment was significantly altered after N self-doping. 44In addition, the specific peaks of N-N (404.5 eV) 28 in hydrazine hydrate were not observed in NCTF-1, indicating that the increase of N content of NCTF-1 was mainly attributed to the changes in the framework structure, rather than the adsorption of hydrazine hydrate alone.Nevertheless, this observation also suggested that the sp 2 C in the triazine ring was not substituted by N atoms, whereas the C atoms of the benzene ring were presumably substituted by nitrogen atoms.This self-doping manner was obviously distinctive with the other doping manner of heteroatoms.Li et al. 45 pointed that the C atoms bonded to H atoms in the benzene ring could be replaced by N atoms and generate pyridinic-N by calcining the as-prepared materials under a reduction atmosphere.These results further corroborated the successful introduction of N into the framework of CTF-1.Meanwhile, this conclusion coincided with the observation that NCTF-1 had stronger peak intensity for pyridinic-N (398.8 eV) than CTF-1.Moreover, the peak corresponding to pyrrolic-N (400.2 eV) in NCTF-1 could make a great contribution to CO 2 adsorption, and this was mainly attributed to interactions between pyrrolic-N (C-NH-C) and CO 2 in the manner of hydrogen bonding. 46The formation of pyrrolic-N was mainly related to the process of the hydrazine hydrate treatment, which introduced pyrrolic-N (C-NH-C) into the CTF-1 surface and linked the C atoms of benzene rings. 46,47Collectively, taking the variation of powder X-ray diffraction, N 1s XPS, and solid-state 13 C NMR spectra into consideration, it could be deduced that the oligomers in CTF-1 further reacted with hydrazine hydrate through cyclocondensation reactions, affording a 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole derivative-modified conjugated network. 38,48,49Thus, the selfdoped N atoms possibly originated from the triazoles, resulting in the structures of pyridinic-N and pyrrolic-N in NCTF-1.Then, the improvement of the CO 2 absorption property is closely associated with the existence of pyridinic-N and pyrrolic-N in NCTF-1, which is also of great significance for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction. Optical and Electrochemical Characterization.To investigate the optical properties of the samples, UV-vis DRS analysis was conducted.As illustrated in Figure 3a, the CTF-1 exhibited an absorption range up to 422 nm with the optical bandgap calculated as 2.94 eV. 23With the modification of nitrogen atoms, the light adsorption band edge of NCTF-1 showed a slight redshift, with the visible-light absorption range extended to 448 nm and a decreased optical bandgap calculated as 2.77 eV.This phenomenon evidenced that the incorporation of nitrogen atoms into the CTF-1 framework could effectively broaden the visible-light response range. 44To explore the effect of nitrogen self-doping on photoinduced charge carrier generation and separation in CTF-1, the electronic band structure with respect to CB and valence band (VB) positions was investigated.As shown in Figure 3b, Mott-Schottky plots presented flat band potentials at -1.23 V and -1.32 V versus Ag/AgCl for CTF-1 and NCTF-1, which were equivalent to -1.03 V and -1.12 V versus NHE, respectively.This clarified that CTF-1 and NCTF-1 were applicable for CO 2 photoreduction from the perspective of thermodynamics.Moreover, the upshift CB position for NCTF-1 theoretically signified an increase in photoreduction ability and presumably will be more favorable in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reactions. 50In addition, the VB positions of the samples were also determined combined with the bandgap values calculated from UV-vis DRS analysis and are depicted in Figure S3. To gain insight into the electrochemical properties of the samples, the photocurrent response when subjected to the periodic on/off light irradiation was measured.As depicted in Figure 3c, significantly enhanced current density for NCTF-1 was observed, elucidating an accelerated charge separation and mobility.To further probe the charge transfer process involved, EIS analysis of CTF-1 and NCTF-1 was conducted.In Figure 3d, there was a reduced semicircle size of NCTF-1 compared to that of pristine CTF-1, implying a higher electron transfer efficiency after nitrogen self-doping. 51Meanwhile, PL spectra of NCTF-1 and CTF-1 were investigated (Figure S4).The NCTF-1 possessed lower impedance than CTF-1 (Figure 3d), suggesting that it should have a lower PL intensity signal.However, NCTF-1 showed stronger PL (peak at 475 nm) intensity than CTF-1, which suggested the generation of a larger number of electrons after N doping when irradiated, owing to a narrower bandgap and enhanced light absorption ability of the NCTF-1.This observation coincided well with the photocurrent study (Figure 3c) in which NCTF-1 exhibited substantially higher photocurrent density than CTF-1.Under this circumstance, the growth rate of the electrons probably surmounts the migration rate, thus inducing a stronger PL signal for NCTF-1. 52,53Hence, it could be postulated that N self-doping in CTF-1 could greatly promote the charge carrier generation, separation, and transport, thus facilitating photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reactions.CO 2 Adsorption and Photocatalytic Performance.It is widely accepted that the ability of CO 2 absorption by photocatalysts is a vital factor affecting the efficiency of photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 . 54As depicted in Figure 4a, CO 2 adsorption isotherms were measured to illustrate the CO 2 uptake capacities.Compared to pristine CTF-1, increased CO 2 uptake ability by NCTF-1 was observed, which could be attributed to the strong affinity between the surface basicity of NCTF-1 and the acidic nature of CO 2 molecules, 55 especially with the increase of relative pressure.To reveal the surface basicities of CTF-1 and NCTF-1 samples, CO 2 -TPD was conducted (Figure 4b).As expected, NCTF-1 had a bigger peak area for the first CO 2 desorption peak in the range of 80-120 C corresponding to the CO 2 physical adsorption inside the pores.The higher temperature (240 C) of the second CO 2 desorption peak manifested the more powerful CO 2 chemical adsorption ability of NCTF-1, which would be helpful for photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 . 56In addition, the nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms of the samples were also measured.As shown in Figure S5, both CTF-1 and NCTF-1 samples presented similar type IV adsorptiondesorption isotherms with a hysteresis loop ranging from 0.8 to 1.0, indicating the existence of an accumulated porous structure.Similar BET surface areas and pore structure profiles were observed for both CTF-1 and NCTF-1.Thus, it could be inferred that the enhanced CO 2 physisorption and chemisorption for NCTF-1 were attributed to the increased Ncontaining species after the introduction of nitrogen atoms other than variation of BET surface areas and pore structure profiles. 57ncouraged by the above advantages of outstanding CO 2 adsorption capacity, enhanced visible-light harvesting, suitable band structure, and accelerated separation/transfer of charge carriers, the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance of CTF-1 and NCTF-1 was systematically evaluated. 58CH 4 and CO were detected as main reduction products in the gas chromatograph.As depicted in Figure 5a and Table S2, the CH 4 evolution rate of NCTF-1(11.48mol g -1 h -1 ) was remarkably greater than that of CTF-1 (1.26 mol g -1 h -1 ).Furthermore, it was found that the selectivity of CH 4 evolution for NCTF-1 was up to 85.42, while that for pristine CTF-1 was only 39.13.This indicated that more end-product CH 4 was produced in comparison with intermediate CO after nitrogen modification.The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity of a typical polymer photocatalyst, N-doped graphitic carbon nitride (N-C 3 N 4 ), which was prepared using the same process, was also measured for comparison.In contrast, the dominant reduction product was CO for N-C 3 N 4 of which the CO 2 -to-CH 4 conversion rate and selectivity were 0.92 mol g -1 h -1 and 11.34, respectively.These results collectively indicate that the NCTF-1 exhibits superior photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity with CH 4 as the dominant product in similar photocatalytic systems.The control experiments, as shown in Figure 5b, indicated that no reduction product can be detected for the control experiments without catalyst or light irradiation, demonstrating the photocatalytic nature of the CO 2 reduction process.Meanwhile, the reaction activity basically disappeared without TEA, implying that the sacrificial reagent for consuming photogenerated holes as well as an alkaline solvent for enhancing CO 2 solubility was indispensable for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.In the absence of H 2 O, the evolution rate of CH 4 greatly decreased, suggesting that H 2 O also played a significant contributive role in the reaction system for providing protons or dissolving CO 2 molecules.The above results underlined that TEA and H 2 O were essential in the CO 2 photoreduction system over NCTF-1.Additionally, when the reaction was conducted under a high-purity N 2 atmosphere to ascertain the carbon source of the generated products, no CH 4 /CO was detected, implying that the carbon origin of CH 4 /CO originated from CO 2 rather than decomposition of any organic matters within the system.This conclusion could be further evidenced by the 13 C-labeled isotopic experiments.As shown in Figure 5c, 13 CH 4 (m/z 17) rather than 12 CH 4 (m/z 16) was the predominant product when 13 CO 2 was used to replace the 12 CO 2 as the atmospheric gas, verifying that CO 2 was the dominating carbon source of CH 4 .In addition, the D 2 O isotopic experiment was also conducted.When H 2 O was replaced by D 2 O, the 12 CD 4 (m/z 20) was detected as the primary product, implying that H 2 O was the main hydrogen source of the generated CH 4 . To investigate the stability of the NCTF-1 samples, three consecutive test cycles with each run of 4 h were performed as shown in Figure 5d.Light irradiation was stopped after each run, and the reactor was evacuated and then refilled with CO 2 without catalyst washing or introducing fresh aqueous solution.There is no obvious deactivation under three cycling tests, highlighting the excellent stability of NCTF-1.In addition, the FTIR and XPS analyses (Figure S6) of the used NCTF-1 also supported the satisfactory stability of the NCTF-1 catalyst.Finally, to gain deeper insight into the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction processes over NCTF-1, the in situ FTIR analysis was performed.Figure 6 shows the in situ FTIR spectra of NCTF-1 during different treatment conditions.Curve i represents the pure NCTF-1 catalyst as a reference.After introduction of CO 2 into NCTF-1, there was no significant change in in situ FTIR spectra (curve ii).While under visiblelight irradiation with a Xe lamp ( 420 nm) (curve iii), the signal corresponding to CO 2 -(1267 cm -1 ) 59 was greatly enhanced, indicating that CO 2 -species was very likely the major intermediate during the reaction process.Additionally, this finding also corroborated the significantly enhanced selectivity from CO 2 toward CH 4 for NCTF-1.Compared with CTF-1 and N-C 3 N 4 , the NCTF-1 contained more nitrogen, which possesses stronger electronegativity.This modification would be beneficial for the formation of N-CO 2 -bonding and permitting longer adsorption of CO 2 -on the surface of the catalyst, thereby ensuring that the intermediates would undergo further hydrogenation and deoxygenation reactions to generate CH 4 . 60ased on the above analyses, it can be deduced that the introduction of nitrogen atoms into CTF-1 is beneficial for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction in several aspects: broadened visible-light absorption, faster charge carrier separation and migration, and larger CO 2 adsorption ability.Moreover, the generation of activated intermediates further facilitated the activity of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction and selectivity for CH 4 . Reaction Mechanisms.Based on the abovementioned experimental results and analyses, the mechanism of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction over NCTF-1 was proposed.As shown in Figure 7, first, the VB electrons (e -) were prompted to the CB under visible-light irradiation, creating holes (h ) in the VB that were subsequently consumed by the sacrificial reagent of TEA.The charge carriers migrated to the surface of the NCTF-1 catalyst.Second, owing to the incorporation of N species into CTF-1, there were more lone pairs of electrons and photogenerated electrons migrating to the CB, resulting in more CO 2 molecules being adsorbed and therein activated by the photogenerated electrons and dark electrons; then, the activated CO 2 was reduced to form"}, {"llm generation": "NCTF-1", "source": "To sum up, a novel NCTF-1 photocatalyst has been successfully synthesized through a simple hydrothermal treatment yielding a stable and metal-free photocatalyst for photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 utilizing visible light.", "context": "To sum up, a novel NCTF-1 photocatalyst has been successfully synthesized through a simple hydrothermal treatment yielding a stable and metal-free photocatalyst for photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 utilizing visible light.Surprisingly, the as-synthesized photocatalysts exhibited superior catalytic performance for selective reduction of CO 2 to CH 4 with a relatively high conversion rate of 11.48 mol g -1 h -1 , which is 9 and 12 times higher than those of bare CTF-1 and individual carbon nitride, respectively.The self-doping process confers CTF-1 unique nitrogen rich features and endows CTF-1 with extended visible-light absorption, optimized electronic properties, and boosted CO 2 adsorption capacity.This work will revitalize studies on artificial photosynthesis by employing a nitrogen-doped CTF as a metal-free efficient, highly selective, and stable photocatalyst for reducing CO 2 to CH 4 .

As for N-doped CTF-1, 0.2 g of obtained CTF-1 and 1.946 mL of hydrazine hydrate were first mixed in 30 mL deionized water and stirred for 2 h.Afterward, the mixture was transferred to a 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and sealed, and then the autoclave was subjected to 180 C hydrothermal treatment for 12 h.After naturally cooling to room temperature, the product was collected, centrifuged, and repeatedly washed with deionized water.Finally, the product was dried at 180 C overnight and denoted as NCTF-1. g-C 3 N 4 was used as the referenced polymeric photocatalyst in this study and obtained by calcination of melamine at 550 C for 4 h with a heating rate of 2.3 C min -1 .The N-doped g-C 3 N 4 was obtained by a process analogous to that for the N-doped CTF-1 in which g-C 3 N 4 replaced the CTF-1 and was denoted as N-C 3 N 4 . Characterization.The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the assynthesized samples were obtained using a Nova Nano SEM 230 microscope (FEI Corp.) and a Tecnai G2 F20 microscope (FEI Corp.), respectively.The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas, pore structures, and the CO 2 uptake capacity of the samples were obtained on an ASAP 2020 (Micromeritics Instrument, USA).X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on an X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku MiniFlex 600, Japan) equipped with Nifiltered Cu-K irradiation.Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were obtained on an IR spectrometer (Nicolet iS10, Thermo Scientific).Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments were conducted on an Avance III 500 (Bruker, USA).X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data were obtained on a PHI Quantum 2000 XPS system (PHI, USA) equipped with a monochromatic Al K X-ray source.UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-vis DRS) were measured on a spectrophotometer (Cary 5000, Agilent, USA).Thermogravimetry analysis (TGA) was carried out on a thermal analyzer (STA 449C, NETZSCH, German).CO 2 temperature-programmed desorption (CO 2 -TPD) was conducted on an AutoChem II (Micromeritics, USA).The maximum temperature was set as 250 C at a ramping rate of 10 C min -1 to record the profile. Photoelectrochemical measurements were conducted in an electrochemical workstation (ZAHNER IM6) with a platinum counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode.The working electrode was prepared by coating photocatalysts on a 0.25 cm 2 fluoride-tin oxide (FTO) glass substrate.In brief, 5 mg of the photocatalyst and 0.5 mL N, N-dimethylformamide were mixed and sonicated for 4 h.Then, the suspension (10 L) was dropped onto the FTO; meanwhile, the uncovered part was coated with epoxy.The Mott-Schottky and photocurrent analyses were performed using 0.2 M Na 2 SO 4 aqueous solution as an electrolyte.The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) plots were recorded using a mixed solution of 5 mM K 3 Fe(CN) 6 /5 mM K 4 Fe(CN) 6 /0.1 M KCl as the electrolyte.Photoluminescence (PL) analysis was performed on an Edinburgh FL/FS900 fluorescence spectrophotometer. Photocatalytic CO 2 Reduction.Typically, the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction experiments were carried out in a quartz glass reactor.The photocatalyst (10 mg) was dispersed in 10 mL deionized water with 15 mmol of triethylamine (TEA) as the sacrificial reagent.Prior to irradiation, the reactor was flushed with CO 2 for 30 min to remove any air.Then, the reactor was sealed, and the reaction mixture was subjected to continuous magnetic stirring and visible-light irradiation for 4 h.Unless otherwise stated, the visible light was provided by a 300 W xenon lamp (PLS-SXE300C).The UV portion was eliminated using a 420 nm cutoff filter.After irradiation, the gas inside the reactor was sampled with a measuring syringe and detected using a gas chromatograph (7890B, Agilent, USA) to determine the conversion rates and selectivity of reduction products. 13C-labeled and 2 H-labeled CO 2 experiments were conducted following the same procedure except that 12 CO 2 and H 2 O were replaced by 13 CO 2 and D 2 O, respectively.The products were analyzed by gas chromatographymass spectrometry (GC-MS) (5977B MSD, Agilent Technology Co.)."}, {"llm generation": "TEA", "source": "Meanwhile, the reaction activity basically disappeared without TEA, implying that the sacrificial reagent for consuming photogenerated holes as well as an alkaline solvent for enhancing CO 2 solubility was indispensable for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.", "context": "Structural and Morphological Properties.The morphological and structural aspects of the samples were probed by SEM and TEM analyses.As illustrated in Figure 1(a,b), the SEM images of both CTF-1 and NCTF-1 showed an analogous layer structure, which can also be recognized in the TEM images (Figure 1(c,d)).Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) elemental mapping analysis clearly demonstrated uniform distributions of C, N, and O within the framework of NCTF-1 (Figure 1e).To further investigate the elemental variation in NCTF-1 and CTF-1, elemental analysis was performed.As shown in Table S1, the concentration of N in NCTF-1 increased, probably suggesting a stronger adsorption capacity of CO 2 molecules owing to the basic sites in N. 32 A higher N/C ratio in NCTF-1 (0.363) compared to that in CTF-1 (0.285) confirmed the successful introduction of the N element into NCTF-1.The thermal stability of CTF-1 and NCTF-1 was estimated by TGA.It was found that the thermal stability of NCTF-1 (stable below 350 C) is significantly higher than that of CTF-1 (stable below 280 C) (Figure S1). XRD analysis was conducted to investigate the crystallinity of the as-synthesized CTF-1 and NCTF-1.As shown in Figure 2a, after the treatment of CTF-1 with hydrazine hydrate, the typical peak located at around 26.9 o , which was attributed to the interlayer-stacking structure, showed an obvious decrease, indicating that CTF-1 subjected to hydrothermal treatment could result in a dramatic exfoliation of the layered crystal structure. 3435536 Meanwhile, the typical peaks assigned to the oligomer 37 disappeared, which could be ascribed to the cyclocondensations of hydrazine and residual nitrile groups in the oligomers, forming a conjugated structure. 38The FTIR spectra of CTF-1 and NCTF-1 samples, as depicted in Figure S2, displayed similar characteristic profiles.The peaks at approximately 1357 and 1508 cm -1 arose from the stretching of the triazine ring. 39Similarly, the signals in NMR spectra of both samples (Figure 2b) were associated with carbon atoms in benzene rings (138 and 128 ppm) and triazine units (170 ppm). 39,40These results collectively indicated that N doping did not significantly alter the structure of CTF-1. XPS analysis was adopted to examine the elemental and chemical state aspects of the samples.As expected, the total N and C contents (atomic percentage) of CTF-1 and NCTF-1 were estimated from the ratio of the integrated peak areas and are depicted in Table S1.The high-resolution spectrum of N 1s in NCTF-1 could be deconvoluted into two peaks at 398.8 and 400.2 eV, corresponding to the sp 2 -hybridized nitrogen in pyridinic-N (CN-C) and pyrrolic-N (N-(C) 3 or C-NH-C), 41 respectively.Both these compositions could serve as Lewis basic sites and may play important roles in the CO 2 capture process. 42As illustrated in Figure 2d, the C 1s spectrum of CTF-1 could be resolved into three peaks centered at 284.6, 286.7, and 288.2 eV, which could be attributed to the graphite-like sp 2 C-C bond, C-N bond, and N-CN bond, respectively. 28,43After the introduction of N, the increased intensity of the C-N bond at 286.7 V is observed, implying the successful introduction of N into the framework of CTF-1.Considering the electronegativity of C and N, a relatively higher N content in NCTF-1 would increase the percentage of ionicity, leading to a higher electron density around the framework. Notably, the peak corresponding to pyridinic-N in NCTF-1 showed an obvious shift toward lower binding energy compared to that in CTF-1, implying that the electron density around the N atoms in the triazine rings of NCTF-1 increased.This suggested that the local chemical environment was significantly altered after N self-doping. 44In addition, the specific peaks of N-N (404.5 eV) 28 in hydrazine hydrate were not observed in NCTF-1, indicating that the increase of N content of NCTF-1 was mainly attributed to the changes in the framework structure, rather than the adsorption of hydrazine hydrate alone.Nevertheless, this observation also suggested that the sp 2 C in the triazine ring was not substituted by N atoms, whereas the C atoms of the benzene ring were presumably substituted by nitrogen atoms.This self-doping manner was obviously distinctive with the other doping manner of heteroatoms.Li et al. 45 pointed that the C atoms bonded to H atoms in the benzene ring could be replaced by N atoms and generate pyridinic-N by calcining the as-prepared materials under a reduction atmosphere.These results further corroborated the successful introduction of N into the framework of CTF-1.Meanwhile, this conclusion coincided with the observation that NCTF-1 had stronger peak intensity for pyridinic-N (398.8 eV) than CTF-1.Moreover, the peak corresponding to pyrrolic-N (400.2 eV) in NCTF-1 could make a great contribution to CO 2 adsorption, and this was mainly attributed to interactions between pyrrolic-N (C-NH-C) and CO 2 in the manner of hydrogen bonding. 46The formation of pyrrolic-N was mainly related to the process of the hydrazine hydrate treatment, which introduced pyrrolic-N (C-NH-C) into the CTF-1 surface and linked the C atoms of benzene rings. 46,47Collectively, taking the variation of powder X-ray diffraction, N 1s XPS, and solid-state 13 C NMR spectra into consideration, it could be deduced that the oligomers in CTF-1 further reacted with hydrazine hydrate through cyclocondensation reactions, affording a 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole derivative-modified conjugated network. 38,48,49Thus, the selfdoped N atoms possibly originated from the triazoles, resulting in the structures of pyridinic-N and pyrrolic-N in NCTF-1.Then, the improvement of the CO 2 absorption property is closely associated with the existence of pyridinic-N and pyrrolic-N in NCTF-1, which is also of great significance for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction. Optical and Electrochemical Characterization.To investigate the optical properties of the samples, UV-vis DRS analysis was conducted.As illustrated in Figure 3a, the CTF-1 exhibited an absorption range up to 422 nm with the optical bandgap calculated as 2.94 eV. 23With the modification of nitrogen atoms, the light adsorption band edge of NCTF-1 showed a slight redshift, with the visible-light absorption range extended to 448 nm and a decreased optical bandgap calculated as 2.77 eV.This phenomenon evidenced that the incorporation of nitrogen atoms into the CTF-1 framework could effectively broaden the visible-light response range. 44To explore the effect of nitrogen self-doping on photoinduced charge carrier generation and separation in CTF-1, the electronic band structure with respect to CB and valence band (VB) positions was investigated.As shown in Figure 3b, Mott-Schottky plots presented flat band potentials at -1.23 V and -1.32 V versus Ag/AgCl for CTF-1 and NCTF-1, which were equivalent to -1.03 V and -1.12 V versus NHE, respectively.This clarified that CTF-1 and NCTF-1 were applicable for CO 2 photoreduction from the perspective of thermodynamics.Moreover, the upshift CB position for NCTF-1 theoretically signified an increase in photoreduction ability and presumably will be more favorable in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reactions. 50In addition, the VB positions of the samples were also determined combined with the bandgap values calculated from UV-vis DRS analysis and are depicted in Figure S3. To gain insight into the electrochemical properties of the samples, the photocurrent response when subjected to the periodic on/off light irradiation was measured.As depicted in Figure 3c, significantly enhanced current density for NCTF-1 was observed, elucidating an accelerated charge separation and mobility.To further probe the charge transfer process involved, EIS analysis of CTF-1 and NCTF-1 was conducted.In Figure 3d, there was a reduced semicircle size of NCTF-1 compared to that of pristine CTF-1, implying a higher electron transfer efficiency after nitrogen self-doping. 51Meanwhile, PL spectra of NCTF-1 and CTF-1 were investigated (Figure S4).The NCTF-1 possessed lower impedance than CTF-1 (Figure 3d), suggesting that it should have a lower PL intensity signal.However, NCTF-1 showed stronger PL (peak at 475 nm) intensity than CTF-1, which suggested the generation of a larger number of electrons after N doping when irradiated, owing to a narrower bandgap and enhanced light absorption ability of the NCTF-1.This observation coincided well with the photocurrent study (Figure 3c) in which NCTF-1 exhibited substantially higher photocurrent density than CTF-1.Under this circumstance, the growth rate of the electrons probably surmounts the migration rate, thus inducing a stronger PL signal for NCTF-1. 52,53Hence, it could be postulated that N self-doping in CTF-1 could greatly promote the charge carrier generation, separation, and transport, thus facilitating photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reactions.CO 2 Adsorption and Photocatalytic Performance.It is widely accepted that the ability of CO 2 absorption by photocatalysts is a vital factor affecting the efficiency of photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 . 54As depicted in Figure 4a, CO 2 adsorption isotherms were measured to illustrate the CO 2 uptake capacities.Compared to pristine CTF-1, increased CO 2 uptake ability by NCTF-1 was observed, which could be attributed to the strong affinity between the surface basicity of NCTF-1 and the acidic nature of CO 2 molecules, 55 especially with the increase of relative pressure.To reveal the surface basicities of CTF-1 and NCTF-1 samples, CO 2 -TPD was conducted (Figure 4b).As expected, NCTF-1 had a bigger peak area for the first CO 2 desorption peak in the range of 80-120 C corresponding to the CO 2 physical adsorption inside the pores.The higher temperature (240 C) of the second CO 2 desorption peak manifested the more powerful CO 2 chemical adsorption ability of NCTF-1, which would be helpful for photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 . 56In addition, the nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms of the samples were also measured.As shown in Figure S5, both CTF-1 and NCTF-1 samples presented similar type IV adsorptiondesorption isotherms with a hysteresis loop ranging from 0.8 to 1.0, indicating the existence of an accumulated porous structure.Similar BET surface areas and pore structure profiles were observed for both CTF-1 and NCTF-1.Thus, it could be inferred that the enhanced CO 2 physisorption and chemisorption for NCTF-1 were attributed to the increased Ncontaining species after the introduction of nitrogen atoms other than variation of BET surface areas and pore structure profiles. 57ncouraged by the above advantages of outstanding CO 2 adsorption capacity, enhanced visible-light harvesting, suitable band structure, and accelerated separation/transfer of charge carriers, the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance of CTF-1 and NCTF-1 was systematically evaluated. 58CH 4 and CO were detected as main reduction products in the gas chromatograph.As depicted in Figure 5a and Table S2, the CH 4 evolution rate of NCTF-1(11.48mol g -1 h -1 ) was remarkably greater than that of CTF-1 (1.26 mol g -1 h -1 ).Furthermore, it was found that the selectivity of CH 4 evolution for NCTF-1 was up to 85.42, while that for pristine CTF-1 was only 39.13.This indicated that more end-product CH 4 was produced in comparison with intermediate CO after nitrogen modification.The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity of a typical polymer photocatalyst, N-doped graphitic carbon nitride (N-C 3 N 4 ), which was prepared using the same process, was also measured for comparison.In contrast, the dominant reduction product was CO for N-C 3 N 4 of which the CO 2 -to-CH 4 conversion rate and selectivity were 0.92 mol g -1 h -1 and 11.34, respectively.These results collectively indicate that the NCTF-1 exhibits superior photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity with CH 4 as the dominant product in similar photocatalytic systems.The control experiments, as shown in Figure 5b, indicated that no reduction product can be detected for the control experiments without catalyst or light irradiation, demonstrating the photocatalytic nature of the CO 2 reduction process.Meanwhile, the reaction activity basically disappeared without TEA, implying that the sacrificial reagent for consuming photogenerated holes as well as an alkaline solvent for enhancing CO 2 solubility was indispensable for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.In the absence of H 2 O, the evolution rate of CH 4 greatly decreased, suggesting that H 2 O also played a significant contributive role in the reaction system for providing protons or dissolving CO 2 molecules.The above results underlined that TEA and H 2 O were essential in the CO 2 photoreduction system over NCTF-1.Additionally, when the reaction was conducted under a high-purity N 2 atmosphere to ascertain the carbon source of the generated products, no CH 4 /CO was detected, implying that the carbon origin of CH 4 /CO originated from CO 2 rather than decomposition of any organic matters within the system.This conclusion could be further evidenced by the 13 C-labeled isotopic experiments.As shown in Figure 5c, 13 CH 4 (m/z 17) rather than 12 CH 4 (m/z 16) was the predominant product when 13 CO 2 was used to replace the 12 CO 2 as the atmospheric gas, verifying that CO 2 was the dominating carbon source of CH 4 .In addition, the D 2 O isotopic experiment was also conducted.When H 2 O was replaced by D 2 O, the 12 CD 4 (m/z 20) was detected as the primary product, implying that H 2 O was the main hydrogen source of the generated CH 4 . To investigate the stability of the NCTF-1 samples, three consecutive test cycles with each run of 4 h were performed as shown in Figure 5d.Light irradiation was stopped after each run, and the reactor was evacuated and then refilled with CO 2 without catalyst washing or introducing fresh aqueous solution.There is no obvious deactivation under three cycling tests, highlighting the excellent stability of NCTF-1.In addition, the FTIR and XPS analyses (Figure S6) of the used NCTF-1 also supported the satisfactory stability of the NCTF-1 catalyst.Finally, to gain deeper insight into the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction processes over NCTF-1, the in situ FTIR analysis was performed.Figure 6 shows the in situ FTIR spectra of NCTF-1 during different treatment conditions.Curve i represents the pure NCTF-1 catalyst as a reference.After introduction of CO 2 into NCTF-1, there was no significant change in in situ FTIR spectra (curve ii).While under visiblelight irradiation with a Xe lamp ( 420 nm) (curve iii), the signal corresponding to CO 2 -(1267 cm -1 ) 59 was greatly enhanced, indicating that CO 2 -species was very likely the major intermediate during the reaction process.Additionally, this finding also corroborated the significantly enhanced selectivity from CO 2 toward CH 4 for NCTF-1.Compared with CTF-1 and N-C 3 N 4 , the NCTF-1 contained more nitrogen, which possesses stronger electronegativity.This modification would be beneficial for the formation of N-CO 2 -bonding and permitting longer adsorption of CO 2 -on the surface of the catalyst, thereby ensuring that the intermediates would undergo further hydrogenation and deoxygenation reactions to generate CH 4 . 60ased on the above analyses, it can be deduced that the introduction of nitrogen atoms into CTF-1 is beneficial for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction in several aspects: broadened visible-light absorption, faster charge carrier separation and migration, and larger CO 2 adsorption ability.Moreover, the generation of activated intermediates further facilitated the activity of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction and selectivity for CH 4 . Reaction Mechanisms.Based on the abovementioned experimental results and analyses, the mechanism of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction over NCTF-1 was proposed.As shown in Figure 7, first, the VB electrons (e -) were prompted to the CB under visible-light irradiation, creating holes (h ) in the VB that were subsequently consumed by the sacrificial reagent of TEA.The charge carriers migrated to the surface of the NCTF-1 catalyst.Second, owing to the incorporation of N species into CTF-1, there were more lone pairs of electrons and photogenerated electrons migrating to the CB, resulting in more CO 2 molecules being adsorbed and therein activated by the photogenerated electrons and dark electrons; then, the activated CO 2 was reduced to form"}], "light source": [{"llm generation": "visible light", "source": "Herein, a novel nitrogen selfdoped covalent triazine-based framework (NCTF-1) was prepared via a simple hydrothermal process for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to CH 4 using visible light.", "context": "Photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide to hydrocarbon fuel provides a sustainable strategy for addressing the increasing energy crisis as well as alleviating the greenhouse effect.Yet, seeking effective, affordable, and metal-free photocatalysts is still a challenging issue.Herein, a novel nitrogen selfdoped covalent triazine-based framework (NCTF-1) was prepared via a simple hydrothermal process for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to CH 4 using visible light.NCTF-1 exhibited a CH 4 evolution rate of 11.48 mol g -1 h -1 , corresponding to ninefold enhancement, compared with bare covalent triazine-based frameworks (CTF-1).The photocatalytic enhancement mechanism was probed by a variety of instrumental measurements.Results showed that the modification of nitrogen atoms in NCTF-1 could extend the responsive range of the visible-light spectrum, promote CO 2 capture, and thus greatly elevate the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity.Notably, NCTF-1 displayed a satisfactory selectivity for CO 2 conversion with CH 4 accounting for over 85 of the reduction products.This study offers a promising avenue for achieving robust CO 2 -to-CH 4 conversion and provides insight into the impact of nitrogen self-doping on covalent triazine-based frameworks."}, {"llm generation": "Visible", "source": "While under visiblelight irradiation with a Xe lamp ( 420 nm) (curve iii), the signal corresponding to CO 2 -(1267 cm -1 ) 59 was greatly enhanced, indicating that CO 2 -species was very likely the major intermediate during the reaction process.", "context": "Structural and Morphological Properties.The morphological and structural aspects of the samples were probed by SEM and TEM analyses.As illustrated in Figure 1(a,b), the SEM images of both CTF-1 and NCTF-1 showed an analogous layer structure, which can also be recognized in the TEM images (Figure 1(c,d)).Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) elemental mapping analysis clearly demonstrated uniform distributions of C, N, and O within the framework of NCTF-1 (Figure 1e).To further investigate the elemental variation in NCTF-1 and CTF-1, elemental analysis was performed.As shown in Table S1, the concentration of N in NCTF-1 increased, probably suggesting a stronger adsorption capacity of CO 2 molecules owing to the basic sites in N. 32 A higher N/C ratio in NCTF-1 (0.363) compared to that in CTF-1 (0.285) confirmed the successful introduction of the N element into NCTF-1.The thermal stability of CTF-1 and NCTF-1 was estimated by TGA.It was found that the thermal stability of NCTF-1 (stable below 350 C) is significantly higher than that of CTF-1 (stable below 280 C) (Figure S1). XRD analysis was conducted to investigate the crystallinity of the as-synthesized CTF-1 and NCTF-1.As shown in Figure 2a, after the treatment of CTF-1 with hydrazine hydrate, the typical peak located at around 26.9 o , which was attributed to the interlayer-stacking structure, showed an obvious decrease, indicating that CTF-1 subjected to hydrothermal treatment could result in a dramatic exfoliation of the layered crystal structure. 3435536 Meanwhile, the typical peaks assigned to the oligomer 37 disappeared, which could be ascribed to the cyclocondensations of hydrazine and residual nitrile groups in the oligomers, forming a conjugated structure. 38The FTIR spectra of CTF-1 and NCTF-1 samples, as depicted in Figure S2, displayed similar characteristic profiles.The peaks at approximately 1357 and 1508 cm -1 arose from the stretching of the triazine ring. 39Similarly, the signals in NMR spectra of both samples (Figure 2b) were associated with carbon atoms in benzene rings (138 and 128 ppm) and triazine units (170 ppm). 39,40These results collectively indicated that N doping did not significantly alter the structure of CTF-1. XPS analysis was adopted to examine the elemental and chemical state aspects of the samples.As expected, the total N and C contents (atomic percentage) of CTF-1 and NCTF-1 were estimated from the ratio of the integrated peak areas and are depicted in Table S1.The high-resolution spectrum of N 1s in NCTF-1 could be deconvoluted into two peaks at 398.8 and 400.2 eV, corresponding to the sp 2 -hybridized nitrogen in pyridinic-N (CN-C) and pyrrolic-N (N-(C) 3 or C-NH-C), 41 respectively.Both these compositions could serve as Lewis basic sites and may play important roles in the CO 2 capture process. 42As illustrated in Figure 2d, the C 1s spectrum of CTF-1 could be resolved into three peaks centered at 284.6, 286.7, and 288.2 eV, which could be attributed to the graphite-like sp 2 C-C bond, C-N bond, and N-CN bond, respectively. 28,43After the introduction of N, the increased intensity of the C-N bond at 286.7 V is observed, implying the successful introduction of N into the framework of CTF-1.Considering the electronegativity of C and N, a relatively higher N content in NCTF-1 would increase the percentage of ionicity, leading to a higher electron density around the framework. Notably, the peak corresponding to pyridinic-N in NCTF-1 showed an obvious shift toward lower binding energy compared to that in CTF-1, implying that the electron density around the N atoms in the triazine rings of NCTF-1 increased.This suggested that the local chemical environment was significantly altered after N self-doping. 44In addition, the specific peaks of N-N (404.5 eV) 28 in hydrazine hydrate were not observed in NCTF-1, indicating that the increase of N content of NCTF-1 was mainly attributed to the changes in the framework structure, rather than the adsorption of hydrazine hydrate alone.Nevertheless, this observation also suggested that the sp 2 C in the triazine ring was not substituted by N atoms, whereas the C atoms of the benzene ring were presumably substituted by nitrogen atoms.This self-doping manner was obviously distinctive with the other doping manner of heteroatoms.Li et al. 45 pointed that the C atoms bonded to H atoms in the benzene ring could be replaced by N atoms and generate pyridinic-N by calcining the as-prepared materials under a reduction atmosphere.These results further corroborated the successful introduction of N into the framework of CTF-1.Meanwhile, this conclusion coincided with the observation that NCTF-1 had stronger peak intensity for pyridinic-N (398.8 eV) than CTF-1.Moreover, the peak corresponding to pyrrolic-N (400.2 eV) in NCTF-1 could make a great contribution to CO 2 adsorption, and this was mainly attributed to interactions between pyrrolic-N (C-NH-C) and CO 2 in the manner of hydrogen bonding. 46The formation of pyrrolic-N was mainly related to the process of the hydrazine hydrate treatment, which introduced pyrrolic-N (C-NH-C) into the CTF-1 surface and linked the C atoms of benzene rings. 46,47Collectively, taking the variation of powder X-ray diffraction, N 1s XPS, and solid-state 13 C NMR spectra into consideration, it could be deduced that the oligomers in CTF-1 further reacted with hydrazine hydrate through cyclocondensation reactions, affording a 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole derivative-modified conjugated network. 38,48,49Thus, the selfdoped N atoms possibly originated from the triazoles, resulting in the structures of pyridinic-N and pyrrolic-N in NCTF-1.Then, the improvement of the CO 2 absorption property is closely associated with the existence of pyridinic-N and pyrrolic-N in NCTF-1, which is also of great significance for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction. Optical and Electrochemical Characterization.To investigate the optical properties of the samples, UV-vis DRS analysis was conducted.As illustrated in Figure 3a, the CTF-1 exhibited an absorption range up to 422 nm with the optical bandgap calculated as 2.94 eV. 23With the modification of nitrogen atoms, the light adsorption band edge of NCTF-1 showed a slight redshift, with the visible-light absorption range extended to 448 nm and a decreased optical bandgap calculated as 2.77 eV.This phenomenon evidenced that the incorporation of nitrogen atoms into the CTF-1 framework could effectively broaden the visible-light response range. 44To explore the effect of nitrogen self-doping on photoinduced charge carrier generation and separation in CTF-1, the electronic band structure with respect to CB and valence band (VB) positions was investigated.As shown in Figure 3b, Mott-Schottky plots presented flat band potentials at -1.23 V and -1.32 V versus Ag/AgCl for CTF-1 and NCTF-1, which were equivalent to -1.03 V and -1.12 V versus NHE, respectively.This clarified that CTF-1 and NCTF-1 were applicable for CO 2 photoreduction from the perspective of thermodynamics.Moreover, the upshift CB position for NCTF-1 theoretically signified an increase in photoreduction ability and presumably will be more favorable in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reactions. 50In addition, the VB positions of the samples were also determined combined with the bandgap values calculated from UV-vis DRS analysis and are depicted in Figure S3. To gain insight into the electrochemical properties of the samples, the photocurrent response when subjected to the periodic on/off light irradiation was measured.As depicted in Figure 3c, significantly enhanced current density for NCTF-1 was observed, elucidating an accelerated charge separation and mobility.To further probe the charge transfer process involved, EIS analysis of CTF-1 and NCTF-1 was conducted.In Figure 3d, there was a reduced semicircle size of NCTF-1 compared to that of pristine CTF-1, implying a higher electron transfer efficiency after nitrogen self-doping. 51Meanwhile, PL spectra of NCTF-1 and CTF-1 were investigated (Figure S4).The NCTF-1 possessed lower impedance than CTF-1 (Figure 3d), suggesting that it should have a lower PL intensity signal.However, NCTF-1 showed stronger PL (peak at 475 nm) intensity than CTF-1, which suggested the generation of a larger number of electrons after N doping when irradiated, owing to a narrower bandgap and enhanced light absorption ability of the NCTF-1.This observation coincided well with the photocurrent study (Figure 3c) in which NCTF-1 exhibited substantially higher photocurrent density than CTF-1.Under this circumstance, the growth rate of the electrons probably surmounts the migration rate, thus inducing a stronger PL signal for NCTF-1. 52,53Hence, it could be postulated that N self-doping in CTF-1 could greatly promote the charge carrier generation, separation, and transport, thus facilitating photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reactions.CO 2 Adsorption and Photocatalytic Performance.It is widely accepted that the ability of CO 2 absorption by photocatalysts is a vital factor affecting the efficiency of photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 . 54As depicted in Figure 4a, CO 2 adsorption isotherms were measured to illustrate the CO 2 uptake capacities.Compared to pristine CTF-1, increased CO 2 uptake ability by NCTF-1 was observed, which could be attributed to the strong affinity between the surface basicity of NCTF-1 and the acidic nature of CO 2 molecules, 55 especially with the increase of relative pressure.To reveal the surface basicities of CTF-1 and NCTF-1 samples, CO 2 -TPD was conducted (Figure 4b).As expected, NCTF-1 had a bigger peak area for the first CO 2 desorption peak in the range of 80-120 C corresponding to the CO 2 physical adsorption inside the pores.The higher temperature (240 C) of the second CO 2 desorption peak manifested the more powerful CO 2 chemical adsorption ability of NCTF-1, which would be helpful for photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 . 56In addition, the nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms of the samples were also measured.As shown in Figure S5, both CTF-1 and NCTF-1 samples presented similar type IV adsorptiondesorption isotherms with a hysteresis loop ranging from 0.8 to 1.0, indicating the existence of an accumulated porous structure.Similar BET surface areas and pore structure profiles were observed for both CTF-1 and NCTF-1.Thus, it could be inferred that the enhanced CO 2 physisorption and chemisorption for NCTF-1 were attributed to the increased Ncontaining species after the introduction of nitrogen atoms other than variation of BET surface areas and pore structure profiles. 57ncouraged by the above advantages of outstanding CO 2 adsorption capacity, enhanced visible-light harvesting, suitable band structure, and accelerated separation/transfer of charge carriers, the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance of CTF-1 and NCTF-1 was systematically evaluated. 58CH 4 and CO were detected as main reduction products in the gas chromatograph.As depicted in Figure 5a and Table S2, the CH 4 evolution rate of NCTF-1(11.48mol g -1 h -1 ) was remarkably greater than that of CTF-1 (1.26 mol g -1 h -1 ).Furthermore, it was found that the selectivity of CH 4 evolution for NCTF-1 was up to 85.42, while that for pristine CTF-1 was only 39.13.This indicated that more end-product CH 4 was produced in comparison with intermediate CO after nitrogen modification.The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity of a typical polymer photocatalyst, N-doped graphitic carbon nitride (N-C 3 N 4 ), which was prepared using the same process, was also measured for comparison.In contrast, the dominant reduction product was CO for N-C 3 N 4 of which the CO 2 -to-CH 4 conversion rate and selectivity were 0.92 mol g -1 h -1 and 11.34, respectively.These results collectively indicate that the NCTF-1 exhibits superior photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity with CH 4 as the dominant product in similar photocatalytic systems.The control experiments, as shown in Figure 5b, indicated that no reduction product can be detected for the control experiments without catalyst or light irradiation, demonstrating the photocatalytic nature of the CO 2 reduction process.Meanwhile, the reaction activity basically disappeared without TEA, implying that the sacrificial reagent for consuming photogenerated holes as well as an alkaline solvent for enhancing CO 2 solubility was indispensable for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.In the absence of H 2 O, the evolution rate of CH 4 greatly decreased, suggesting that H 2 O also played a significant contributive role in the reaction system for providing protons or dissolving CO 2 molecules.The above results underlined that TEA and H 2 O were essential in the CO 2 photoreduction system over NCTF-1.Additionally, when the reaction was conducted under a high-purity N 2 atmosphere to ascertain the carbon source of the generated products, no CH 4 /CO was detected, implying that the carbon origin of CH 4 /CO originated from CO 2 rather than decomposition of any organic matters within the system.This conclusion could be further evidenced by the 13 C-labeled isotopic experiments.As shown in Figure 5c, 13 CH 4 (m/z 17) rather than 12 CH 4 (m/z 16) was the predominant product when 13 CO 2 was used to replace the 12 CO 2 as the atmospheric gas, verifying that CO 2 was the dominating carbon source of CH 4 .In addition, the D 2 O isotopic experiment was also conducted.When H 2 O was replaced by D 2 O, the 12 CD 4 (m/z 20) was detected as the primary product, implying that H 2 O was the main hydrogen source of the generated CH 4 . To investigate the stability of the NCTF-1 samples, three consecutive test cycles with each run of 4 h were performed as shown in Figure 5d.Light irradiation was stopped after each run, and the reactor was evacuated and then refilled with CO 2 without catalyst washing or introducing fresh aqueous solution.There is no obvious deactivation under three cycling tests, highlighting the excellent stability of NCTF-1.In addition, the FTIR and XPS analyses (Figure S6) of the used NCTF-1 also supported the satisfactory stability of the NCTF-1 catalyst.Finally, to gain deeper insight into the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction processes over NCTF-1, the in situ FTIR analysis was performed.Figure 6 shows the in situ FTIR spectra of NCTF-1 during different treatment conditions.Curve i represents the pure NCTF-1 catalyst as a reference.After introduction of CO 2 into NCTF-1, there was no significant change in in situ FTIR spectra (curve ii).While under visiblelight irradiation with a Xe lamp ( 420 nm) (curve iii), the signal corresponding to CO 2 -(1267 cm -1 ) 59 was greatly enhanced, indicating that CO 2 -species was very likely the major intermediate during the reaction process.Additionally, this finding also corroborated the significantly enhanced selectivity from CO 2 toward CH 4 for NCTF-1.Compared with CTF-1 and N-C 3 N 4 , the NCTF-1 contained more nitrogen, which possesses stronger electronegativity.This modification would be beneficial for the formation of N-CO 2 -bonding and permitting longer adsorption of CO 2 -on the surface of the catalyst, thereby ensuring that the intermediates would undergo further hydrogenation and deoxygenation reactions to generate CH 4 . 60ased on the above analyses, it can be deduced that the introduction of nitrogen atoms into CTF-1 is beneficial for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction in several aspects: broadened visible-light absorption, faster charge carrier separation and migration, and larger CO 2 adsorption ability.Moreover, the generation of activated intermediates further facilitated the activity of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction and selectivity for CH 4 .

As for N-doped CTF-1, 0.2 g of obtained CTF-1 and 1.946 mL of hydrazine hydrate were first mixed in 30 mL deionized water and stirred for 2 h.Afterward, the mixture was transferred to a 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and sealed, and then the autoclave was subjected to 180 C hydrothermal treatment for 12 h.After naturally cooling to room temperature, the product was collected, centrifuged, and repeatedly washed with deionized water.Finally, the product was dried at 180 C overnight and denoted as NCTF-1. g-C 3 N 4 was used as the referenced polymeric photocatalyst in this study and obtained by calcination of melamine at 550 C for 4 h with a heating rate of 2.3 C min -1 .The N-doped g-C 3 N 4 was obtained by a process analogous to that for the N-doped CTF-1 in which g-C 3 N 4 replaced the CTF-1 and was denoted as N-C 3 N 4 . Characterization.The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the assynthesized samples were obtained using a Nova Nano SEM 230 microscope (FEI Corp.) and a Tecnai G2 F20 microscope (FEI Corp.), respectively.The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas, pore structures, and the CO 2 uptake capacity of the samples were obtained on an ASAP 2020 (Micromeritics Instrument, USA).X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on an X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku MiniFlex 600, Japan) equipped with Nifiltered Cu-K irradiation.Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were obtained on an IR spectrometer (Nicolet iS10, Thermo Scientific).Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments were conducted on an Avance III 500 (Bruker, USA).X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data were obtained on a PHI Quantum 2000 XPS system (PHI, USA) equipped with a monochromatic Al K X-ray source.UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-vis DRS) were measured on a spectrophotometer (Cary 5000, Agilent, USA).Thermogravimetry analysis (TGA) was carried out on a thermal analyzer (STA 449C, NETZSCH, German).CO 2 temperature-programmed desorption (CO 2 -TPD) was conducted on an AutoChem II (Micromeritics, USA).The maximum temperature was set as 250 C at a ramping rate of 10 C min -1 to record the profile. Photoelectrochemical measurements were conducted in an electrochemical workstation (ZAHNER IM6) with a platinum counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode.The working electrode was prepared by coating photocatalysts on a 0.25 cm 2 fluoride-tin oxide (FTO) glass substrate.In brief, 5 mg of the photocatalyst and 0.5 mL N, N-dimethylformamide were mixed and sonicated for 4 h.Then, the suspension (10 L) was dropped onto the FTO; meanwhile, the uncovered part was coated with epoxy.The Mott-Schottky and photocurrent analyses were performed using 0.2 M Na 2 SO 4 aqueous solution as an electrolyte.The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) plots were recorded using a mixed solution of 5 mM K 3 Fe(CN) 6 /5 mM K 4 Fe(CN) 6 /0.1 M KCl as the electrolyte.Photoluminescence (PL) analysis was performed on an Edinburgh FL/FS900 fluorescence spectrophotometer. Photocatalytic CO 2 Reduction.Typically, the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction experiments were carried out in a quartz glass reactor.The photocatalyst (10 mg) was dispersed in 10 mL deionized water with 15 mmol of triethylamine (TEA) as the sacrificial reagent.Prior to irradiation, the reactor was flushed with CO 2 for 30 min to remove any air.Then, the reactor was sealed, and the reaction mixture was subjected to continuous magnetic stirring and visible-light irradiation for 4 h.Unless otherwise stated, the visible light was provided by a 300 W xenon lamp (PLS-SXE300C).The UV portion was eliminated using a 420 nm cutoff filter.After irradiation, the gas inside the reactor was sampled with a measuring syringe and detected using a gas chromatograph (7890B, Agilent, USA) to determine the conversion rates and selectivity of reduction products. 13C-labeled and 2 H-labeled CO 2 experiments were conducted following the same procedure except that 12 CO 2 and H 2 O were replaced by 13 CO 2 and D 2 O, respectively.The products were analyzed by gas chromatographymass spectrometry (GC-MS) (5977B MSD, Agilent Technology Co.)."}, {"llm generation": "Xenon", "source": "While under visiblelight irradiation with a Xe lamp ( 420 nm) (curve iii), the signal corresponding to CO 2 -(1267 cm -1 ) 59 was greatly enhanced, indicating that CO 2 -species was very likely the major intermediate during the reaction process.", "context": "Structural and Morphological Properties.The morphological and structural aspects of the samples were probed by SEM and TEM analyses.As illustrated in Figure 1(a,b), the SEM images of both CTF-1 and NCTF-1 showed an analogous layer structure, which can also be recognized in the TEM images (Figure 1(c,d)).Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) elemental mapping analysis clearly demonstrated uniform distributions of C, N, and O within the framework of NCTF-1 (Figure 1e).To further investigate the elemental variation in NCTF-1 and CTF-1, elemental analysis was performed.As shown in Table S1, the concentration of N in NCTF-1 increased, probably suggesting a stronger adsorption capacity of CO 2 molecules owing to the basic sites in N. 32 A higher N/C ratio in NCTF-1 (0.363) compared to that in CTF-1 (0.285) confirmed the successful introduction of the N element into NCTF-1.The thermal stability of CTF-1 and NCTF-1 was estimated by TGA.It was found that the thermal stability of NCTF-1 (stable below 350 C) is significantly higher than that of CTF-1 (stable below 280 C) (Figure S1). XRD analysis was conducted to investigate the crystallinity of the as-synthesized CTF-1 and NCTF-1.As shown in Figure 2a, after the treatment of CTF-1 with hydrazine hydrate, the typical peak located at around 26.9 o , which was attributed to the interlayer-stacking structure, showed an obvious decrease, indicating that CTF-1 subjected to hydrothermal treatment could result in a dramatic exfoliation of the layered crystal structure. 3435536 Meanwhile, the typical peaks assigned to the oligomer 37 disappeared, which could be ascribed to the cyclocondensations of hydrazine and residual nitrile groups in the oligomers, forming a conjugated structure. 38The FTIR spectra of CTF-1 and NCTF-1 samples, as depicted in Figure S2, displayed similar characteristic profiles.The peaks at approximately 1357 and 1508 cm -1 arose from the stretching of the triazine ring. 39Similarly, the signals in NMR spectra of both samples (Figure 2b) were associated with carbon atoms in benzene rings (138 and 128 ppm) and triazine units (170 ppm). 39,40These results collectively indicated that N doping did not significantly alter the structure of CTF-1. XPS analysis was adopted to examine the elemental and chemical state aspects of the samples.As expected, the total N and C contents (atomic percentage) of CTF-1 and NCTF-1 were estimated from the ratio of the integrated peak areas and are depicted in Table S1.The high-resolution spectrum of N 1s in NCTF-1 could be deconvoluted into two peaks at 398.8 and 400.2 eV, corresponding to the sp 2 -hybridized nitrogen in pyridinic-N (CN-C) and pyrrolic-N (N-(C) 3 or C-NH-C), 41 respectively.Both these compositions could serve as Lewis basic sites and may play important roles in the CO 2 capture process. 42As illustrated in Figure 2d, the C 1s spectrum of CTF-1 could be resolved into three peaks centered at 284.6, 286.7, and 288.2 eV, which could be attributed to the graphite-like sp 2 C-C bond, C-N bond, and N-CN bond, respectively. 28,43After the introduction of N, the increased intensity of the C-N bond at 286.7 V is observed, implying the successful introduction of N into the framework of CTF-1.Considering the electronegativity of C and N, a relatively higher N content in NCTF-1 would increase the percentage of ionicity, leading to a higher electron density around the framework. Notably, the peak corresponding to pyridinic-N in NCTF-1 showed an obvious shift toward lower binding energy compared to that in CTF-1, implying that the electron density around the N atoms in the triazine rings of NCTF-1 increased.This suggested that the local chemical environment was significantly altered after N self-doping. 44In addition, the specific peaks of N-N (404.5 eV) 28 in hydrazine hydrate were not observed in NCTF-1, indicating that the increase of N content of NCTF-1 was mainly attributed to the changes in the framework structure, rather than the adsorption of hydrazine hydrate alone.Nevertheless, this observation also suggested that the sp 2 C in the triazine ring was not substituted by N atoms, whereas the C atoms of the benzene ring were presumably substituted by nitrogen atoms.This self-doping manner was obviously distinctive with the other doping manner of heteroatoms.Li et al. 45 pointed that the C atoms bonded to H atoms in the benzene ring could be replaced by N atoms and generate pyridinic-N by calcining the as-prepared materials under a reduction atmosphere.These results further corroborated the successful introduction of N into the framework of CTF-1.Meanwhile, this conclusion coincided with the observation that NCTF-1 had stronger peak intensity for pyridinic-N (398.8 eV) than CTF-1.Moreover, the peak corresponding to pyrrolic-N (400.2 eV) in NCTF-1 could make a great contribution to CO 2 adsorption, and this was mainly attributed to interactions between pyrrolic-N (C-NH-C) and CO 2 in the manner of hydrogen bonding. 46The formation of pyrrolic-N was mainly related to the process of the hydrazine hydrate treatment, which introduced pyrrolic-N (C-NH-C) into the CTF-1 surface and linked the C atoms of benzene rings. 46,47Collectively, taking the variation of powder X-ray diffraction, N 1s XPS, and solid-state 13 C NMR spectra into consideration, it could be deduced that the oligomers in CTF-1 further reacted with hydrazine hydrate through cyclocondensation reactions, affording a 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole derivative-modified conjugated network. 38,48,49Thus, the selfdoped N atoms possibly originated from the triazoles, resulting in the structures of pyridinic-N and pyrrolic-N in NCTF-1.Then, the improvement of the CO 2 absorption property is closely associated with the existence of pyridinic-N and pyrrolic-N in NCTF-1, which is also of great significance for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction. Optical and Electrochemical Characterization.To investigate the optical properties of the samples, UV-vis DRS analysis was conducted.As illustrated in Figure 3a, the CTF-1 exhibited an absorption range up to 422 nm with the optical bandgap calculated as 2.94 eV. 23With the modification of nitrogen atoms, the light adsorption band edge of NCTF-1 showed a slight redshift, with the visible-light absorption range extended to 448 nm and a decreased optical bandgap calculated as 2.77 eV.This phenomenon evidenced that the incorporation of nitrogen atoms into the CTF-1 framework could effectively broaden the visible-light response range. 44To explore the effect of nitrogen self-doping on photoinduced charge carrier generation and separation in CTF-1, the electronic band structure with respect to CB and valence band (VB) positions was investigated.As shown in Figure 3b, Mott-Schottky plots presented flat band potentials at -1.23 V and -1.32 V versus Ag/AgCl for CTF-1 and NCTF-1, which were equivalent to -1.03 V and -1.12 V versus NHE, respectively.This clarified that CTF-1 and NCTF-1 were applicable for CO 2 photoreduction from the perspective of thermodynamics.Moreover, the upshift CB position for NCTF-1 theoretically signified an increase in photoreduction ability and presumably will be more favorable in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reactions. 50In addition, the VB positions of the samples were also determined combined with the bandgap values calculated from UV-vis DRS analysis and are depicted in Figure S3. To gain insight into the electrochemical properties of the samples, the photocurrent response when subjected to the periodic on/off light irradiation was measured.As depicted in Figure 3c, significantly enhanced current density for NCTF-1 was observed, elucidating an accelerated charge separation and mobility.To further probe the charge transfer process involved, EIS analysis of CTF-1 and NCTF-1 was conducted.In Figure 3d, there was a reduced semicircle size of NCTF-1 compared to that of pristine CTF-1, implying a higher electron transfer efficiency after nitrogen self-doping. 51Meanwhile, PL spectra of NCTF-1 and CTF-1 were investigated (Figure S4).The NCTF-1 possessed lower impedance than CTF-1 (Figure 3d), suggesting that it should have a lower PL intensity signal.However, NCTF-1 showed stronger PL (peak at 475 nm) intensity than CTF-1, which suggested the generation of a larger number of electrons after N doping when irradiated, owing to a narrower bandgap and enhanced light absorption ability of the NCTF-1.This observation coincided well with the photocurrent study (Figure 3c) in which NCTF-1 exhibited substantially higher photocurrent density than CTF-1.Under this circumstance, the growth rate of the electrons probably surmounts the migration rate, thus inducing a stronger PL signal for NCTF-1. 52,53Hence, it could be postulated that N self-doping in CTF-1 could greatly promote the charge carrier generation, separation, and transport, thus facilitating photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reactions.CO 2 Adsorption and Photocatalytic Performance.It is widely accepted that the ability of CO 2 absorption by photocatalysts is a vital factor affecting the efficiency of photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 . 54As depicted in Figure 4a, CO 2 adsorption isotherms were measured to illustrate the CO 2 uptake capacities.Compared to pristine CTF-1, increased CO 2 uptake ability by NCTF-1 was observed, which could be attributed to the strong affinity between the surface basicity of NCTF-1 and the acidic nature of CO 2 molecules, 55 especially with the increase of relative pressure.To reveal the surface basicities of CTF-1 and NCTF-1 samples, CO 2 -TPD was conducted (Figure 4b).As expected, NCTF-1 had a bigger peak area for the first CO 2 desorption peak in the range of 80-120 C corresponding to the CO 2 physical adsorption inside the pores.The higher temperature (240 C) of the second CO 2 desorption peak manifested the more powerful CO 2 chemical adsorption ability of NCTF-1, which would be helpful for photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 . 56In addition, the nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms of the samples were also measured.As shown in Figure S5, both CTF-1 and NCTF-1 samples presented similar type IV adsorptiondesorption isotherms with a hysteresis loop ranging from 0.8 to 1.0, indicating the existence of an accumulated porous structure.Similar BET surface areas and pore structure profiles were observed for both CTF-1 and NCTF-1.Thus, it could be inferred that the enhanced CO 2 physisorption and chemisorption for NCTF-1 were attributed to the increased Ncontaining species after the introduction of nitrogen atoms other than variation of BET surface areas and pore structure profiles. 57ncouraged by the above advantages of outstanding CO 2 adsorption capacity, enhanced visible-light harvesting, suitable band structure, and accelerated separation/transfer of charge carriers, the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance of CTF-1 and NCTF-1 was systematically evaluated. 58CH 4 and CO were detected as main reduction products in the gas chromatograph.As depicted in Figure 5a and Table S2, the CH 4 evolution rate of NCTF-1(11.48mol g -1 h -1 ) was remarkably greater than that of CTF-1 (1.26 mol g -1 h -1 ).Furthermore, it was found that the selectivity of CH 4 evolution for NCTF-1 was up to 85.42, while that for pristine CTF-1 was only 39.13.This indicated that more end-product CH 4 was produced in comparison with intermediate CO after nitrogen modification.The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity of a typical polymer photocatalyst, N-doped graphitic carbon nitride (N-C 3 N 4 ), which was prepared using the same process, was also measured for comparison.In contrast, the dominant reduction product was CO for N-C 3 N 4 of which the CO 2 -to-CH 4 conversion rate and selectivity were 0.92 mol g -1 h -1 and 11.34, respectively.These results collectively indicate that the NCTF-1 exhibits superior photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity with CH 4 as the dominant product in similar photocatalytic systems.The control experiments, as shown in Figure 5b, indicated that no reduction product can be detected for the control experiments without catalyst or light irradiation, demonstrating the photocatalytic nature of the CO 2 reduction process.Meanwhile, the reaction activity basically disappeared without TEA, implying that the sacrificial reagent for consuming photogenerated holes as well as an alkaline solvent for enhancing CO 2 solubility was indispensable for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.In the absence of H 2 O, the evolution rate of CH 4 greatly decreased, suggesting that H 2 O also played a significant contributive role in the reaction system for providing protons or dissolving CO 2 molecules.The above results underlined that TEA and H 2 O were essential in the CO 2 photoreduction system over NCTF-1.Additionally, when the reaction was conducted under a high-purity N 2 atmosphere to ascertain the carbon source of the generated products, no CH 4 /CO was detected, implying that the carbon origin of CH 4 /CO originated from CO 2 rather than decomposition of any organic matters within the system.This conclusion could be further evidenced by the 13 C-labeled isotopic experiments.As shown in Figure 5c, 13 CH 4 (m/z 17) rather than 12 CH 4 (m/z 16) was the predominant product when 13 CO 2 was used to replace the 12 CO 2 as the atmospheric gas, verifying that CO 2 was the dominating carbon source of CH 4 .In addition, the D 2 O isotopic experiment was also conducted.When H 2 O was replaced by D 2 O, the 12 CD 4 (m/z 20) was detected as the primary product, implying that H 2 O was the main hydrogen source of the generated CH 4 . To investigate the stability of the NCTF-1 samples, three consecutive test cycles with each run of 4 h were performed as shown in Figure 5d.Light irradiation was stopped after each run, and the reactor was evacuated and then refilled with CO 2 without catalyst washing or introducing fresh aqueous solution.There is no obvious deactivation under three cycling tests, highlighting the excellent stability of NCTF-1.In addition, the FTIR and XPS analyses (Figure S6) of the used NCTF-1 also supported the satisfactory stability of the NCTF-1 catalyst.Finally, to gain deeper insight into the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction processes over NCTF-1, the in situ FTIR analysis was performed.Figure 6 shows the in situ FTIR spectra of NCTF-1 during different treatment conditions.Curve i represents the pure NCTF-1 catalyst as a reference.After introduction of CO 2 into NCTF-1, there was no significant change in in situ FTIR spectra (curve ii).While under visiblelight irradiation with a Xe lamp ( 420 nm) (curve iii), the signal corresponding to CO 2 -(1267 cm -1 ) 59 was greatly enhanced, indicating that CO 2 -species was very likely the major intermediate during the reaction process.Additionally, this finding also corroborated the significantly enhanced selectivity from CO 2 toward CH 4 for NCTF-1.Compared with CTF-1 and N-C 3 N 4 , the NCTF-1 contained more nitrogen, which possesses stronger electronegativity.This modification would be beneficial for the formation of N-CO 2 -bonding and permitting longer adsorption of CO 2 -on the surface of the catalyst, thereby ensuring that the intermediates would undergo further hydrogenation and deoxygenation reactions to generate CH 4 . 60ased on the above analyses, it can be deduced that the introduction of nitrogen atoms into CTF-1 is beneficial for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction in several aspects: broadened visible-light absorption, faster charge carrier separation and migration, and larger CO 2 adsorption ability.Moreover, the generation of activated intermediates further facilitated the activity of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction and selectivity for CH 4 . Reaction Mechanisms.Based on the abovementioned experimental results and analyses, the mechanism of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction over NCTF-1 was proposed.As shown in Figure 7, first, the VB electrons (e -) were prompted to the CB under visible-light irradiation, creating holes (h ) in the VB that were subsequently consumed by the sacrificial reagent of TEA.The charge carriers migrated to the surface of the NCTF-1 catalyst.Second, owing to the incorporation of N species into CTF-1, there were more lone pairs of electrons and photogenerated electrons migrating to the CB, resulting in more CO 2 molecules being adsorbed and therein activated by the photogenerated electrons and dark electrons; then, the activated CO 2 was reduced to form"}], "reaction medium": [{"llm generation": "Liquid", "source": "The photocatalyst (10 mg) was dispersed in 10 mL deionized water with 15 mmol of triethylamine (TEA) as the sacrificial reagent.", "context": "Synthesis of Photocatalysts.CTF-1 was prepared according to our previously reported polymerization method. 23In brief, 5.12 g terephthalonitrile was dispersed in 40 mL trifluoromethanesulfonic acid in a round-bottom flask at 0 C.After solidification and keeping under static conditions at 30 C for 3 days, the product was smashed and washed with dichloromethane and ammonium solution.The product was then filtered and redispersed in ammonium solution.The solid was collected by centrifugation with distilled water and methanol and then Soxhlet-extracted with methanol and dichloromethane, respectively.The product was vacuum-dried at 80 C for 12 h and ground into powder.

Photoelectrochemical measurements were conducted in an electrochemical workstation (ZAHNER IM6) with a platinum counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode.The working electrode was prepared by coating photocatalysts on a 0.25 cm 2 fluoride-tin oxide (FTO) glass substrate.In brief, 5 mg of the photocatalyst and 0.5 mL N, N-dimethylformamide were mixed and sonicated for 4 h.Then, the suspension (10 L) was dropped onto the FTO; meanwhile, the uncovered part was coated with epoxy.The Mott-Schottky and photocurrent analyses were performed using 0.2 M Na 2 SO 4 aqueous solution as an electrolyte.The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) plots were recorded using a mixed solution of 5 mM K 3 Fe(CN) 6 /5 mM K 4 Fe(CN) 6 /0.1 M KCl as the electrolyte.Photoluminescence (PL) analysis was performed on an Edinburgh FL/FS900 fluorescence spectrophotometer. Photocatalytic CO 2 Reduction.Typically, the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction experiments were carried out in a quartz glass reactor.The photocatalyst (10 mg) was dispersed in 10 mL deionized water with 15 mmol of triethylamine (TEA) as the sacrificial reagent.Prior to irradiation, the reactor was flushed with CO 2 for 30 min to remove any air.Then, the reactor was sealed, and the reaction mixture was subjected to continuous magnetic stirring and visible-light irradiation for 4 h.Unless otherwise stated, the visible light was provided by a 300 W xenon lamp (PLS-SXE300C).The UV portion was eliminated using a 420 nm cutoff filter.After irradiation, the gas inside the reactor was sampled with a measuring syringe and detected using a gas chromatograph (7890B, Agilent, USA) to determine the conversion rates and selectivity of reduction products. 13C-labeled and 2 H-labeled CO 2 experiments were conducted following the same procedure except that 12 CO 2 and H 2 O were replaced by 13 CO 2 and D 2 O, respectively.The products were analyzed by gas chromatographymass spectrometry (GC-MS) (5977B MSD, Agilent Technology Co.)."}], "operation mode": []}}
