For comparison, OVs in the surface of BiOBr were partially repaired by solvothermal and calcination methods.The EPR results demonstrate that both DOV-BiOBr-C and DOV-BiOBr-H possess lower EPR signal than that of pristine BiOBr (Fig. S1b).Therefore, the concentration of OVs of BiOBr is higher than that of DOV-BiOBr-C and DOV-BiOBr-H.In This article is protected by copyright.All rights reserved shown in Fig. S1d, the bind energy of 158.6 and 163.9 eV belong to the Bi 4f 7/2 and Bi 4f 5/2 for BiOBr, indicating that the existence element bismuth is in a positive trivalent oxidation state 39.After the construction of OVs, the Bi BiOBr and OV-BiOBr-2 is 0.277 nm, corresponding to the (110) plane of tetragonal BiOBr, and the result is consistent with XRD 41.The HR-TEM images also show that numerous lattice disorder structure in OV-BiOBr-2, which suggests that more defects have been introduced after the construction of surface OVs (Figs. 1f and1g) 42.The image inset of Fig. 1g and Fig. S2d are the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) images for OV-BiOBr-2 and BiOBr, the clear concentric circles suggests the polycrystalline structure of prepared materials 43.EDS results explicate that the existence of Bi, O and Br in both OV-BiOBr-2 This article is protected by copyright.All rights reserved and BiOBr (Fig. S3).These results above further illustrate that the surface OVs-rich BiOBr atomic layers have been successfully constructed. The optical absorption properties of BiOBr and OV-BiOBr-2 were tested via UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy.As shown in Fig. 2a, all the samples exhibit higher optical absorption intensity in 400-800 nm, the pure BiOBr absorption edge is around 447 nm.While OVs-rich BiOBr showed red shift with OV-BiOBr-2 absorption edges of 484 nm (Fig. S4), which indicates that the surface OVs can effectively promote absorption ability of the photocatalyst and ehance photocatalysis performance.Meanwhile, the results of (E photon ) 1/2 vs E photon curves show that band gap energy (E g ) for BiOBr and OV-BiOBr-2 are 2.49 and 2.10 eV, respectively (Fig. 2b).In generally, surface OVs will induce a shallow donor level below the conduction band (E CB ) minimum, thus the localized electrons can be direct excite to the CB and enhance the visible light absorption performance of photocatalyst 44.Mott-chottky curves were used to measure flat band potentials of BiOBr and OV-BiOBr-2. The positive slope of the Mott-Schottky curves indicates that both BiOBr and OV-BiOBr-2 is N-type semiconductor (Figs.2c andS5a) 45. According to the extrapolation of X intercept in Mott-schotty curve, the flat band potentials of BiOBr and OV-BiOBr-2 are 0.25 and 0.32 eV vs NHE (pH 7).As for the N-type semiconductors, the Fermi level is close This article is protected by copyright.All rights reserved to the flat band potential 46.Besides, combined with XPS valence band spectra results (Figs. 2d andS5b), the valence band (E VB ) of BiOBr and OV-BiOBr-2 were calculated to be 1.12 and 1.11 eV, respectively. According to the formula E CB E VB E g , E CB minimum of BiOBr and OV-BiOBr-2 is 1.37 and 0.99 eV, respectively.The result demonstrates that the both BiOBr and OV-BiOBr-2 possess appropriate redox potentials for CO 2 photoreduction. Figs. 2e and 2f are the N 2 adsorption/desorption isotherm of BiOBr and OV-BiOBr-2, the type IV isotherm and typical hysteresis loop in medium and high pressure regions indicate the presence of mesopores 47.The BET surface area of BiOBr and OV-BiOBr-2 is 2.99 and 6.07 m 2 g -1 , respectively.The results show that construction of OVs is beneficial to increase the specific surface area of photocatalyst, which is conducive to enhance the exposure of active sites and promote CO 2 adsorption. The activity of all photocatalysts was studied in pure water with a temperature of 5 C under 300 W Xe lamp (which is equipped with 400 nm cutoff filter) irradiation.The product is CO based on gas chromatography results, which indicated that the selectivity of CO 2 to CO conversion was 100.After five hours photocatalytic CO 2 conversion reduction, the CO production yields of BiOBr, OV-BiOBr-1, OV-BiOBr-2 and OV-BiOBr-3 is 5.09, 8.08, 10.15 and 8.86 mol g -1 (Fig. 3a), This article is protected by copyright.All rights reserved respectively.In addtion, the corresponding average production rate of BiOBr, OV-BiOBr-1, OV-BiOBr-2, OV-BiOBr-3 is 1.02, 1.61, 2.03 and 1.77 mol g -1 h -1 (Fig. 3b), respectively.OV-BiOBr-2 equips the highest concentration of OVs and shows the optimized CO 2 photoreduction performance.The CO production yields of DOV-BiOBr-C and DOV-BiOBr-H is 2.65 and 1.87 mol g -1 under visible light irradiation for 5 h, which is poor than that of BiOBr and OV-BiOBr (Fig. S6), suggesting that the surface OVs play a very important role in CO 2 photoreduction process.Some research results show that OVs are the active sites, which can boost CO 2 adsorption and activation, stabilize intermediates, decrease the reaction energy barriers, thus facilitating the CO 2 photoreduction perfomance 48.Thus, surface oxygen vacancies engineering is beneficial to enhance photocatalytic activity of semiconductors.The stability is significantly important to evaluate the practical value of the photocatalyst.The OV-BiOBr-2 nanosheets exhibit little loss of photocatalytic activity after the fifth cycles for CO 2 photoreduction (Fig. 3c).The XRD pattern reveals that the crystal structure of OV-BiOBr-2 is not changed after photocatalytic reaction (Fig. S7).Moreover, the TEM images further show that OV-BiOBr-2 still maintains the ultrathin nanosheet structure after stability measurement (Fig. S8).The OVs proportion of OV-BiOBr-2 after stable measurement only decreases little compared to that of OV-BiOBr-2 (Fig. S9).All those This article is protected by copyright.All rights reserved results suggest that the OV-BiOBr-2 possesses excellent CO 2 photoreduction activity and understanding stability. To elucidate the effects of OVs on boosting CO 2 photoreduction activity on obtained photocatalysts, the photoelectrochemical characterization of the samples were further carried out.Meanwhile, EIS was further carried out to learn the carriers separation behavior of obtained photocatalysts, and the results are shown in Figs.3c andS10a. Comparing to BiOBr/FTO, OV-BiOBr-1/FTO and OV-BiOBr-3/FTO electrodes, the OV-BiOBr-2/FTO electrode shows the smallest Nyquist semicircular diameter, and which indicates that the OV-BiOBr-2 photocatalyst has a lowest charge transfer resistance 49.The transient photocurrent was measured to estimate the separation performance of photogenerated carrier.As shown in Figs.3d andS10b, OV-BiOBr-X (X 1, 2 and 3) possess a higher photocurrent response than that of original BiOBr, while the photocurrent response of DOV-BiOBr-H and DOV-BiOBr-C samples is lower than that of BiOBr, which reflects the introduction of surface OVs will promote the photogenerated electron-hole pairs transfer process 50.All these photoelectrochemical results suggest that surface oxygen vacancies engineering is beneficial to promote the separation of photoinduced charge and enhance the light absorption performance, thus boosting the CO 2 photoreduction process. The CO 2 adsorption performance is generally regarded as another This article is protected by copyright.All rights reserved precondition during the CO 2 photoreduction process 51.As shown in Fig. 4a, the OV-BiOBr-2 possesses the maximum CO 2 adsorption capacity of 5.38 cm 3 g -1 , which is higher than that of the original BiOBr material (3.88 cm 3 g -1 ).The result indicates that OVs can provide more surface active sites to improve the CO 2 adsorption properties, which is propitious to boost the CO 2 photoreduction.In addition, it is generally believed that water can be used as a proton source in the process of CO 2 photoreduction, the close contact between photocatalysts and water will be good for CO 2 conversion.Therefore, the static water contact angle measurement was investigated to verify the hydrophilicity of the samples (Fig. 4b).The contact angle of OV-BiOBr-2 is 16.39 which is smaller than that of BiOBr (36.82).The smaller water contact angle shows higher surface hydrophilicity, which is important to promote more effective surface electron transfer during the reaction in water and improve the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance 52.The above results strongly illustrate that the OVs on the ultrathin BiOBr nanosheet are conducive to enhance proton affinity and CO 2 adsorption, thus greatly boosting the CO 2 photoreduction process. To further understanding the CO 2 photoreduction process, in situ fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (in situ FT-IR) measurement was used to reveal the intermediate products.To remove the surface contaminants, the OV-BiOBr-2 material was treated at 120 C and This article is protected by copyright.All rights reserved protected by helium.Subsequently, the CO 2 and H 2 O were introduced to prior sample in dark and the background was obtained after a adsorption-desorption equilibrium process.Afterwards, the in situ FT-IR spectra were measured under illumination.As are shown in Fig. 4c, the peaks at 1254 cm -1 and 1577 cm -1 can be assigned to bidentate carbonate (b-CO 3 2-), while the peaks at 1425, 1446 and 1457 cm -1 can be ascribed to the bicarbonate (HCO where \"\" represents the corresponding adsorption state of catalyst surface.

Figs. 2e and 2f are the N 2 adsorption/desorption isotherm of BiOBr and OV-BiOBr-2, the type IV isotherm and typical hysteresis loop in medium and high pressure regions indicate the presence of mesopores 47.The BET surface area of BiOBr and OV-BiOBr-2 is 2.99 and 6.07 m 2 g -1 , respectively.The results show that construction of OVs is beneficial to increase the specific surface area of photocatalyst, which is conducive to enhance the exposure of active sites and promote CO 2 adsorption. The activity of all photocatalysts was studied in pure water with a temperature of 5 C under 300 W Xe lamp (which is equipped with 400 nm cutoff filter) irradiation.The product is CO based on gas chromatography results, which indicated that the selectivity of CO 2 to CO conversion was 100.After five hours photocatalytic CO 2 conversion reduction, the CO production yields of BiOBr, OV-BiOBr-1, OV-BiOBr-2 and OV-BiOBr-3 is 5.09, 8.08, 10.15 and 8.86 mol g -1 (Fig. 3a), This article is protected by copyright.All rights reserved respectively.In addtion, the corresponding average production rate of BiOBr, OV-BiOBr-1, OV-BiOBr-2, OV-BiOBr-3 is 1.02, 1.61, 2.03 and 1.77 mol g -1 h -1 (Fig. 3b), respectively.OV-BiOBr-2 equips the highest concentration of OVs and shows the optimized CO 2 photoreduction performance.The CO production yields of DOV-BiOBr-C and DOV-BiOBr-H is 2.65 and 1.87 mol g -1 under visible light irradiation for 5 h, which is poor than that of BiOBr and OV-BiOBr (Fig. S6), suggesting that the surface OVs play a very important role in CO 2 photoreduction process.Some research results show that OVs are the active sites, which can boost CO 2 adsorption and activation, stabilize intermediates, decrease the reaction energy barriers, thus facilitating the CO 2 photoreduction perfomance 48.Thus, surface oxygen vacancies engineering is beneficial to enhance photocatalytic activity of semiconductors.The stability is significantly important to evaluate the practical value of the photocatalyst.The OV-BiOBr-2 nanosheets exhibit little loss of photocatalytic activity after the fifth cycles for CO 2 photoreduction (Fig. 3c).The XRD pattern reveals that the crystal structure of OV-BiOBr-2 is not changed after photocatalytic reaction (Fig. S7).Moreover, the TEM images further show that OV-BiOBr-2 still maintains the ultrathin nanosheet structure after stability measurement (Fig. S8).The OVs proportion of OV-BiOBr-2 after stable measurement only decreases little compared to that of OV-BiOBr-2 (Fig. S9).All those This article is protected by copyright.All rights reserved results suggest that the OV-BiOBr-2 possesses excellent CO 2 photoreduction activity and understanding stability. To elucidate the effects of OVs on boosting CO 2 photoreduction activity on obtained photocatalysts, the photoelectrochemical characterization of the samples were further carried out.Meanwhile, EIS was further carried out to learn the carriers separation behavior of obtained photocatalysts, and the results are shown in Figs.3c andS10a. Comparing to BiOBr/FTO, OV-BiOBr-1/FTO and OV-BiOBr-3/FTO electrodes, the OV-BiOBr-2/FTO electrode shows the smallest Nyquist semicircular diameter, and which indicates that the OV-BiOBr-2 photocatalyst has a lowest charge transfer resistance 49.The transient photocurrent was measured to estimate the separation performance of photogenerated carrier.As shown in Figs.3d andS10b, OV-BiOBr-X (X 1, 2 and 3) possess a higher photocurrent response than that of original BiOBr, while the photocurrent response of DOV-BiOBr-H and DOV-BiOBr-C samples is lower than that of BiOBr, which reflects the introduction of surface OVs will promote the photogenerated electron-hole pairs transfer process 50.All these photoelectrochemical results suggest that surface oxygen vacancies engineering is beneficial to promote the separation of photoinduced charge and enhance the light absorption performance, thus boosting the CO 2 photoreduction process.
