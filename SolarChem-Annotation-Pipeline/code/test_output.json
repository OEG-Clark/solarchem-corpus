UV-vis diffused reflectance spectra (DRS) was measured by a UV-vis spectrophotometer (U-3900, HITACHI, Japan).The steadystate and transient fluorescence was carried out by a fluorescence spectrometer (FLS 980, Edinburgh, England) coupled with a time-correlated single photocounting system.The Mott-Schottky curves were obtained on an electrochemical workstation (CHI660D) with a three-electrode cell with Pt as a counter electrode, Ag/AgCl as a reference electrode, and an electrolyte (0.5 M Na 2 SO 4 aqueous solution at pH 7).A Scion 456 gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) using a methanizer and a GC9790 Plus gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with a TCD were utilized to analyze the gas products. 2.4.Photoreduction Procedure.The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction was evaluated in an airtight glass reactor with a quartz top cap and a gas sampling port.Typically, 10 mg of photocatalyst, 45 mg of bipyridine (bpy), 60 L of CoCl 2 aqueous solution (54.6 mM), and 6 mL of the mixed reaction solution (V CH 3 CN /V TEOA 4:1) were mixed in a reactor.Then, the reactor was evacuated, and was purged with high purity CO 2 at a partial pressure of 0.1 MPa.This process was carried out several times to ensure that the reactor was full of pure CO 2 .The solution was irradiated with a 300 W xenon lamp (420 nm) with 400 mW cm -2 of light intensity (10.5 cm distance from the reaction solution).During irradiation, the reaction system was stirred and kept at a temperature of 15 C with a condenser circulation pump.The generated products were quantified every 2 h by a flame ionization detector (FID).", "annotations": [{"category": "catalyst", "answer": "photocatalyst", "source": "Typically, 10 mg of photocatalyst, 45 mg of bipyridine (bpy), 60 L of CoCl 2 aqueous solution (54.6 mM), and 6 mL of the mixed reaction solution (V CH 3 CN /V TEOA 4:1) were mixed in a reactor.", "annotator": "hybrid annotation"}, {"category": "reaction medium", "answer": "aqueous solution", "source": "The Mott-Schottky curves were obtained on an electrochemical workstation (CHI660D) with a three-electrode cell with Pt as a counter electrode, Ag/AgCl as a reference electrode, and an electrolyte (0.5 M Na 2 SO 4 aqueous solution at pH 7).", "annotator": "hybrid annotation"}, {"category": "reactor type", "answer": "glass reactor", "source": "The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction was evaluated in an airtight glass reactor with a quartz top cap and a gas sampling port.", "annotator": "hybrid annotation"}, {"category": "lamp", "answer": "xenon lamp", "source": "The solution was irradiated with a 300 W xenon lamp (420 nm) with 400 mW cm -2 of light intensity (10.5 cm distance from the reaction solution).", "annotator": "hybrid annotation"}, {"category": "operation mode", "answer": "Batch", "source": "During irradiation, the reaction system was stirred and kept at a temperature of 15 C with a condenser circulation pump.", "annotator": "hybrid annotation"}]}, {"paragraph_text": "In summary, In 2 S 3 NH 2 -MIL-68(In)In 2 S 3 (SMS(In)) sandwich homologous heterojunction with a hollow nanotube structure was designed and assembled by the controllable in situ sulfuration of NH 2 -MIL-68(In) for visible-light-driven CO 2 reduction.The subtle design not only maintained the original merits of NH 2 -MIL-68(In) but also endowed the composite material with dual interfacial homologous heterojunction shells, which showed enhanced adsorption and mass transfer of CO 2 , abundant reactive sites, and remarkably enhanced the separation and transfer efficiency of the photoinduced charge.As a consequence, the optimum sample (SMS(In)-7) exhibited outstanding photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction with a much more excellent CO generation rate (11.23 mol g -1 h -1 ), almost 3 times that of the pure MOFderived In 2 S 3 .This work proposes an instructive pathway for constructing an atomic MOF heterojunction for artificial photosynthesis.
