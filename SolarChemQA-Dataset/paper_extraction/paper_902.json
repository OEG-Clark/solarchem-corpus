Firstly, Poly (N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone) (PVP, Mw40000) (0.8 g) was dissolved in ethylene glycol (40mL).Then certain amounts of Bi(NO3)35H2O and SeO2 were introduced into the above solution, followed by the addition of 2 mL NaOH solution (5 mol/L).After fiercely stirring for half an hour, the mixed solution was transferred, sealed in a Teflon vessel, and then treated at 230 C for 40 min.After cooling down to the room temperature, the as-prepared particles were collected by centrifugation and washed with deionized water and ethanol.Finally, it was dried at 60 C for 6 h in vacuum oven. g-C3N4 powder was synthesized by the conventional polymerization method.To be specific, 20 g melamine were put in crucible and then thermally treated at 550 C for 4 h.Then, the obtained yellow particles were ground for fine powders and washed, dried at 60 C for 6 h. To be specific, 1g of pre-synthesized g-C3N4 were dispersed in 200 mL ethanol/deionized water mixed solution via ultrasonication about 1 h.After that, a certain amounts of Bi2Se3 were introduced into the above solution with further ultrasonication for 12 h.Finally, the samples was collected by centrifugation and dried at 60 C.The additions of Bi2Se3 in composite were 150, 100, 50, and 30 mg, named as 15BSCN, 10BSCN, 5BSCN and 3BSCN, respectively. J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f The structure of the samples was studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis (D/MAX-RB). X-ray photo-electron spectroscopy (XPS) data were collected with ESCALAB II XPS system. All spectra were calibrated by 284.5 eV of C 1s.To obtain the shape of the particles, the analyses of scanning electron microscope (SEM) were carried out on Hitachi S4800 and JSM-5610LV.The structure and morphology of the samples were further measured by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM).The surface functional groups of the specimens were checked by Thermo Nicolet Nexus spectrometer combined In-situ test equipment.PL emission spectra were obtained by a fluorescence spectrophotometer (RF-5301PC).The UV-vis diffuse reflectance (DRS) spectra of the materials were tested by UV-2550 (Shimadzu, Japan). The photocatalytic performance of the samples was investigated by the reduction of CO2 with H2O using 300 W Xe lamp as irradiation source, carrying out in a self-designed glassware photoreactor (volume 500 mL).Desired amount (50 mg) of particles and an appropriate amount of water was added into a glass culture dish (60 mm), ultrasonically spread the sample evenly and then placed the culture dish in an oven for drying.Prior to light irradiation, the reactor was vacuum treated, and then the CO2 in reactor was produced by the reaction of NaHCO3 and concentrated H2SO4.After that, 3 mL deionized water were injected into the reactor followed by the switch on of light.At given interval time, 200 L of reacted gas were withdrawn to check products using GC-7820.The detailed process of photocatalytic reduction of CO2 is shown in figure S1. The electronic properties of the samples were calculated by the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) referred to DFT with PBE functional of GGA.The unit cell parameters of the samples were optimized with the residual force of less than 0.05 eV/A, the iterative energy variation was less than 10 -5 eV, and the cutoff energy of wave functions was set as 500 eV."}, {"title": "Results_and_discussion", "content": "To systematically study the crystal structure of the as-fabricated particles, XRD characterization was analyzed.Figure S2 exhibits the XRD patterns of the samples prepared at different weight ratios of Bi2Se3 and g-C3N4.It is clear that four strong diffraction peaks of Bi2Se3 located at 25.0, 29.35, 40.26 and 43.66, which are assigned to the (101), ( 015), ( 1010) and (110) crystal planes of bare Bi2Se3 (JCPDS No. 89-2008), separately 26 .As for pure g-C3N4, two obvious diffraction peaks at 13.0 and 27.5 presented, which are ascribed to the (100) and (002) planes, respectively.When Bi2Se3 formed composite with g-C3N4, all characteristic diffraction peaks of Bi2Se3 and g-C3N4 were exhibited in XRD patterns of X BSCN (X3, 5 and 10) composites and no other impurities were detected, implying that the pure Bi2Se3/g-C3N4 composites had been successfully synthesized and the structure of the materials didn't change after ultrasonication preparation. The surface morphology and structure of the Bi2Se3/g-C3N4 composite were studied by SEM, TEM, HRTEM and element mapping as presented in Figure 1 and Figure S3.It is explicit that 2D Bi2Se3 and 2D g-C3N4 had successfully combined together to form composite as expected (Figure 1a).The clear crystal lattice fringes with the d-spacing of 0.21 nm could be observed in Figure 1b, which is well indexed to the (11-20) planes of Bi2Se3 and the fuzzy areas in top right corner should be assigned to the g-C3N4, indicating the poor crystallinity of g-C3N4 as prepared in this J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f work.Meanwhile, the down left corner SAED pattern presented nice single-crystalline lines with six-fold symmetry, which could be ascribed to the Bi2Se3 substrate along the 0001 zone axis 27 . To verify this composite more intuitively, the element mapping was conducted as displayed in Figure 1e-h.It is explicit that the elements of Bi, Se, C, N had been uniformly dispersed in the as-presented nanosheet.So the above results could further confirm that the 2D/2D Bi2Se3/g-C3N4 composites had been successfully prepared. FTIR was employed to identify the surface status of the samples as given in Figure 2.There are several pairs of peaks appeared in the FTIR spectrum of pure g-C3N4.Among them, the absorption peak at 806 cm -1 corresponds to the out-of-plane stretching vibration of the C-N ring 28 .The typical band at 1239-1568 cm -1 and 1638 cm -1 are corresponding to the vibration of the C-N aromatic ring and the stretching vibration of the C-N ring, respectively.As for Bi2Se3, much less peaks are demonstrated, and the absorption peaks at 3414, 1658 and 1286 cm -1 are attributed to the stretching vibration of -OH, CO, and C-N group, separately 29 .As Bi2Se3 formed composite with g-C3N4, all of peaks belonged to g-C3N4 could be found in the FTIR spectrum of 5BSCN, while neither 1658 cm -1 nor 1286 cm -1 peaks ascribed to Bi2Se3 were obviously detected, which should be due to the low content of Bi2Se3 in 5BSCN composite and the relatively weak FTIR peak intensity of pure Bi2Se3. To further analyze the surface states of the atoms in composite, the XPS test was utilized as exhibited in Figure 3. Figure 3a illustrates the high resolution XPS spectra of Bi 4f.Two strong peaks at approximately 158.2 eV and 163.4 eV could be observed for pure Bi2Se3, which are attributed to the binding energies of the Bi 4f5/2 and Bi 4f7/2, respectively.While these two peaks in 5BSCN composite were shifted to lower binding energy about 0.1 eV.This obvious shift was J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f probably because of the electron transfer from g-C3N4 to Bi2Se3 and the similar phenomenon was observed in other works 30,31 .In addition, this shift could also confirm the intimate contact between g-C3N4 and Bi2Se3 in 5BSCN composite induced by physical electrostatic interaction. Two characteristic peaks were also displayed in Se 3d spectra of pure Bi2Se3 (Figure 3b).The peaks situated at 53.6 eV and 52.8 eV were corresponding to Se 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 in Bi2Se3, respectively.In 5BSCN composite, the similar two peaks were shown about with negative shift about 0.2 eV, the reason for which was probably owing to the same reason as that of peak shift in Bi 4f spectra.As for C 1s spectra in Figure 4c Where a, h, k and Eg are on behalf of the absorption coefficient, photo energy, constant and band gap, separately.Since both g-C3N4 and Bi2Se3 belong to n-type semiconductors, which could be obtained from Figure 4c that the Mott-Schottky plots of them all presented positive slopes, the band gap energy of g-C3N4 and Bi2Se3 was calculated to be about 2.7 eV and 0.5 eV, respectively. To further determine the detailed band gap structure of samples, the electrochemical Mott-Schottky plots were carried out as presented in Figure 4c.In this case, the flat potentials of g-C3N4 and Bi2Se3 could be intercepted from the Mott-Schottky plot, which are about -1.25 V and -0.45 V (vs.Ag/AgCl), respectively.Therefore, the Efb of g-C3N4 and Bi2Se3 can be estimated to be -1.05 and -0.5d.It is clear that the Fermi level of g-C3N4 should be much negative than that of Bi2Se3, Hence, after junction between these semiconductors, electrons are very easily transferred from the CB of g-C3N4 to CB of Bi2Se3 until equilibrium state is reached with the same Fermi level (Figure S4).At the equilibrium state, Bi2Se3 could be acted as like a cocatalyst and J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f then the electrons are very easily transferred from the CB of g-C3N4 to CB of Bi2Se3 because of potential difference, which is very in favor of charge separation for Bi2Se3/g-C3N4 and the similar phenomenon has also reported in other work 30 . In this work, the photocatalytic performance of the as-synthesized samples was evaluated by the reduction of low concentration of CO2 under the irradiation of Xe lamp. Figure 5a shows the photocatalytic CO2 reduction property of different samples under Xe lamp irradiation without filter.It can be clearly seen that Bi2Se3 presented no obvious photocatalytic performance.As for g-C3N4, it displayed small amount of CO2 reduction ability with CO yield rate of ca.1.3 mol/gh as presented in Figure 5d.Notably, after g-C3N4 combined with Bi2Se3 to form composites, the photocatalytic CO2 reduction ability of the samples was greatly improved.With increasing Bi2Se3 content, the photocatalytic property enhanced and as 5 of Bi2Se3 added, the sample 5BSCN exhibited the best photocatalytic activity with CO yield rate of ca.8.2 mol/gh as presented in Figure 5b.However, further increasing Bi2Se3 content, the photocatalytic activity decreased.This phenomenon is mainly due to that as too much of Bi2Se3 added, more light could be absorbed by Bi2Se3 and subsequently much less for g-C3N4 so that much more light was used for heating conversion instead of photocatalysis.536 More importantly, all the composites presented nearly 100 selectivity for CO2 reduction to CO.To investigate the superiority of composite over solely g-C3N4, the photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity of 5BSCN composite under different circumstances were conducted as shown in Figure 6b.Under dark or without catalyst, no obvious CO2 reduction property was detected, indicating that the yield of CO was produced by photocatalysis.Under the pure N2 atmosphere without C source, the sample exhibited J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f a tiny photocatalytic activity, which should be because of that a little bit organic materials, existed in 5BSCN after preparation, were decomposed and transferred into CO under light irradiation. While under the light and pure low concentration of CO2 condition, 5BSCN composite presented extinguished photocatalytic activity, implying that the detected CO was really photocatalytic reduced from CO2.What's interesting, under the irradiation of UV light, 5BSCN composite showed obvious CO production with the rate of ca.4.2 mol/gh, while under the irradiation of visible and NIR lights, only tiny CO yield was observed.At the same time, with full spectrum of Xe lamp irradiation, the CO producing rate of the sample composite reached 8.2 mol/gh.These interesting results could get two informations.On one hand, means that the visible and NIR light absorbed by 5BSCN composite weren't used to produce photogenerated charge carriers for CO2 reduction but majority of them was converted into heat, which could be indirectly confirmed in Figure 5c.It is apparent that under the irradiation of full spectrum of Xe lamp about 15 mins, the surface temperature of pure g-C3N4 was about 90 C, while for 5BSCN composite, it achieved ca.190 C.The detailed temperature test diagram is shown in figure S5. Figure 4a has displayed that g-C3N4 can only absorb UV and some part of visible light, but 5BSCN composite can absorb the whole spectrum from UV light to NIR light.In addition, it is well recognized that the UV and NIR lights could be converted into heat.So the much increased surface temperature of 5BSCN composite over pure g-C3N4 should be result from that the more absorbed visible and NIR light by 5BSCN composite had mainly transferred into heat.On the other hand, the heat converted from absorbed visible and NIR light had played a positive effect on the photocatalytic CO2 reduction of 5BSCN composite.In addition, under the irradiation UV light, 5BSCN composite presented much higher CO yield rate than that of pure g-C3N4 in Figure 5d.Therefore, the superior photocatalytic J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f CO2 reduction ability of 5BSCN composite over pure g-C3N4 under the irradiation of full spectrum of Xe lamp should be due to the synergetic of heating and improved charge transfer in heterojunction which will be discussed below in detail. In addition to selectivity and photocatalytic efficiency, the photocatalytic stability is another key factor, which should be considered as photocatalyst.Figure S6 presents the photocatalytic performance of 5BSCN composite with four cycles.It is obvious that the sample showed excellent photocatalytic CO2 reduction stability and only ca.2.4 activity was reduced after four runs test, which should be owing to the loss of particles during washing samples and the residue by-productions left on the surface of sample covering the active sites.In addition, small amounts of H2 production were also produced in the photocatalytic process by water splitting because of the suitable CB position of the samples.But the selectivity for CO2 reduction reached above 90 as compared to H2 evolution. To unveil the above-mentioned effective charge separation ability for the superior photocatalytic CO2 reduction ability of 5BSCN composite over other sample, firstly, PL spectra of the samples was detected as shown in Figure 8a.Under the excitation of 312 nm light, pure g-C3N4 presented strong emission peak located at ca. 460 nm, which is originated from the intrinsic band structure.However, the PL intensity of g-C3N4 significantly decreased when it hybridized with Bi2Se3, and the 5BSCN composite exhibited the lowest emission intensity, indicating that this sample obtained the optimal charge separation ability over other samples.In addition, the time-resolved transient PL spectroscopy was utilized to disclose the photogenerated charge carriers' separation process as displayed in Figure 8b.Apparently, 5BSCN composite showed much longer emission lifetime (39.66ns) than that of pure g-C3N4 with value of 30.65 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f ns and the detailed information about these data and equation was supplemented in Table.S1.The prolonged lifetime of charge carriers and weaker PL intensity suggested that the recombination of photocarriers of g-C3N4 in the hrterojunction was inhibited, thus the migration of electron-hole pairs was enhanced.Furthermore, the photoelectrochemical measurement was also conducted to investigate the charge separation and transfer.As shown in Figure 6c and 6d, 5BSCN composite demonstrated the highest photocurrent density over other samples under the irradiation of full spectrum, and it also presented the lowest resistance ability.These results also verified that the photogenerated charge carries in 5BSCN composite could be effectively separated and then transferred to the sample surface as compared to those of pure g-C3N4 and Bi2Se3. DFT calculation was further applied to explore the band gap structure and charge separation condition of Bi2Se3/g-C3N4 composite from the viewpoint of theory.Figure 7a-b present the density of states (DOS) of Bi2Se3 and g-C3N4, respectively.The VB and CB of Bi2Se3 are mainly hybridized by the d orbits of Se and f orbits of Bi, and, the Se d orbits make the dominant contribution to VB, while for CB, it turns on to Bi f orbits.As for g-C3N4, its band states are comprised by the 2s orbits of C and 2s orbits of N. In addition, the calculated band gaps of both Bi2Se3 and g-C3N4 are smaller than the experimental value as exhibited in Figure 4, which should be due to the restriction of the DFT calculation.The very narrow band gap of Bi2Se3 made it suitable for cocatalyst liked role in photocatalysis.Figure 7c-d exhibit the charge difference distribution and the corresponding electronic location function images to unveil the charge separation condition between Bi2Se3 and g-C3N4.It's obvious that when the heterostructure between the g-C3N4 and Bi2Se3 forms, the cyan and yellow region exhibited the agminated electrons migrate from g-C3N4 to the Bi2Se3.Meanwhile, the electronic location function image J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f demonstrates that there exists a distinct covalent interaction between the C atom of g-C3N4 triazine and Bi-Se layer, forming a charge transfer channel to transfer from g-C3N4 to Bi2Se3 nanosheets 37,38 .So the above experimental test and theoretical calculation could together confirm that when g-C3N4 and Bi2Se3 formed composite, the charge separation and transfer ability between them could be dramatically improved as compared to that of solely counterparts. Besides, to clarify the mechanism of the photocatalytic CO2 reduction process over Bi2Se3/g-C3N4 composite, the in-situ FTIR analysis was tested, identifying the surface functional groups on samples during photocatalysis as shown in Figure 8.It is explicit that before light irradiation, no obvious peaks could be observed, while as light on, series peaks around 1210-1250 cm -1 and 1613-1770 cm -1 appeared, moreover, the relative intensity increased with increasing irradiation time.The peaks located at 1210-1250 cm -1 and 1613-1770 cm -1 could be assigned to the functional groups, including COOH groups, bidentate bicarbonate species (b-HCO3 -), monodentate carbonate (m-CO3 2-), bidentate carbonate (b-CO3 2-), as well as a bent carboxylate (CO2 -) 39,40 .Interestingly, all these peaks disappeared as the light off, indicating that all these functional groups should be the intermediates produced during the photocatalytic CO2 reduction process.On the basis of these in-situ FTIR results, the photocatalytic CO2 reduction process over 5BSCN composite could be deduced as follows: Initially, atmosphere CO2 was adsorbed on the surface of the sample while H2O molecules was dissociated into hydroxyl and hydrogen ions on the surface.Next, the adsorbed CO2 would be activated under irradiation of light to produce CO2 species, and then these species gradually reacted with the surface protons to generate COOH , which is the key intermediate during selective photoreduction of CO2 to CO.After that, COOH species could be further protonated into CO molecules.Finally, the produced CO species ( 1 ) So based on the above discussion, the mechanism about the efficiency of selectively photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO by 2D/2D Bi2Se3/g-C3N4 composite could be proposed as presented in Figure 9.Under the illumination of Xe lamp, g-C3N4 could absorb UV and partial visible lights which would further be used to produce hole-electron pairs.Then, the photogenerated electrons on the CB of g-C3N4 transferred to the CB of Bi2Se3 because of the difference potential.In this case, the photoinduced hole-electron pairs in g-C3N4 could be effectively separated for photocatalysis.After that, the photogenerated electrons on CB of g-C3N4 and Bi2Se3 could attend the reaction of surface absorbed CO2 and H2O to produce CO and H2.On the other hand, Bi2Se3 enabled to absorb the whole UV, visible and NIR lights, and the absorbed full spectrum light would partially be converted to heat on the surface of composite, which would further make a contribution to the surface CO2 reduction to significantly improve its efficiency."}, {"title": "Conclusions", "content": "The 2D/2D Bi2Se3/g-C3N4 composite has been successfully prepared by a facile method.The surface of 2D g-C3N4 presented strong inherent interactions with that of 2D Bi2Se3 in composite J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f so that the charge could be effectively transferred between them.The addition of Bi2Se3 made the light absorption of g-C3N4 extend into the whole wavelength of light covering UV, visible and NIR light.In this case, 2D/2D Bi2Se3/g-C3N4 composite exhibited excellent low concentration of CO2 reduction ability under the irradiation of full spectrum, which is much better than those of solely Bi2Se3 and g-C3N4.More importantly, the reduction of CO2 to CO demonstrated nearly 100 selectivity.The superiority of Bi2Se3/g-C3N4 composite over other counterparts should be due to two reasons.Firstly, Bi2Se3 acted as like a cocatalyst with suitable fermi level and tightly combined with g-C3N4 so that the charge separation of g-C3N4 could be significantly improved; Secondly, the absorbed visible and NIR light by Bi2Se3 could be largely converted into heat, which further made a positive contribution to the CO2 reduction.The composite proposed in this work would provide a new effective way to improve the photocatalytic CO2 reduction ability.J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f photocatalysis. 25 V versus normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) according to equation of ENHE EAg/AgCl 0.197 V.Meanwhile, the conduction band (CB) minimum should be ca.0.1 V above the flat potential for n-type semiconductors.So after calibrating the Ag/AgCl potential to normal hydrogen electrode (NHE), the CB positions of g-C3N4 and Bi2Se3 are ca.-1.15 eV and -0.35 eV (vs.NHE), separately.Referring to the band gap equation EVBEgECB, the VB positions of these two semiconductors are 1.55 eV and 0.15 eV.The corresponding band structure of them was demonstrated in Figure n a l P r e -p r o o f desorbed from the catalyst surface to generate CO.The detailed reduction processes were demonstrated as follows: CO2 C O 2 Fig. 1.TEM images (a, d), HRTEM image (b), SAED pattern (c) and element mapping images Fig. 2.
