Please do not adjust margins Since the introduced Zn species could react with Ga 2 O 3 to generate the ZnGa 2 O 4 crystal structure with the bulk phase of Ga 2 O 3 remaining unchanged, the surface of Ga 2 O 3 is expected to be covered with a layer of ZnGa 2 O 4 .XPS measurement is a surface-sensitive technique because the probing depth of XPS usually varies between 1.5 and 6 nm depending on the kinetic energy of the photoelectrons. 24 Figure 9 shows the SEM images of Ag-loaded Ga 2 O 3 with and without modification by Zn species.As shown, formation of ZnGa 2 O 4 layer on the surface of Ga 2 O 3 with various amounts of Zn species caused insignificant changes in the particle size compared to bare Ga 2 O 3 .Moreover, the morphology of each Zn-modified Ga 2 O 3 with different amounts of Zn species was similar to that of bare Ga 2 O 3 .These results are consistent with XRD and BET measurement.In addition, the Ag particles by the photodeposition method were aggregated on the Ga 2 O 3 and Zn-modified Ga 2 O 3 photocatalysts observed in the SEM images (Figure 9 and S2), and the size and the dispersion of Ag particles were similar for each sample.The weak surface plasmon absorptions at the visible region in the UV-Vis DRS of Ag-loaded Ga 2 O 3 and Ag-loaded Zn-modified Ga 2 O 3 (Figure S3) were attributed to the aggregation and poor dispersion of Ag particles.The chemical state of Ag particles prepared by the photodeposition method was proved to be metallic Ag shown in Figure S4 and S5.The atomic ratio of Ag was nearly constant in the Ag-loaded Zn-modified Ga 2 O 3 samples with different Zn content (Table S1).It is clear that the physical and chemical properties of Ag particles deposited on the Ga 2 O 3 and Zn-modified Ga 2 O 3 photocatalysts were not dominated by the variation of Zn addition.Therefore, the improvement of the selectivity towards CO evolution over Ag-loaded Zn-modified Ga Table 1.The formation rate of gas products and selectivity toward CO evolution in the photocatalytic conversion of CO2 by H2O over various photocatalysts a Photocatalysts The mixture of CO and H 2 , which is well known as synthesis gas, is one of the most crucial raw materials in the chemical industry.Especially, since it is very difficult to adjust the ratio of H 2 by CO (so-called, H 2 /CO ratio) depending on products of the Fischer-Tropsch technology.In this study, the synthesis gas was produced via the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 with H 2 O as an electron donor over Ag-loaded Zn-modified Ga 2 O 3 photocatalysts and the ratio of H 2 to CO was finely controlled by the straightforward alteration of Zn addition."}, {"title": "Conclusions", "content": "Stoichiometric amounts of CO, H 2 , and O 2 were evolved in the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 by H 2 O as an electron donor using an Ag-loaded Zn-modified Ga 2 O 3 photocatalyst.The production of H 2 gradually decreased with increasing amounts of Zn species from 0.1 to 10.0 mol, whereas the evolution of CO was almost unchanged.Consequently, the selectivity toward CO evolution increased to almost 100. Figure 1 shows the formation rates of CO, H 2 , and O 2 and selectivity toward CO evolution for the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 by H 2 O over Ag-loaded Zn-modified Ga 2 O 3 with various amounts of Zn species.All photocatalysts tested could stoichiometrically produce CO, H 2 , and O 2 under photoirradiation.Other reduction products, such as CH 4 in the gas phase or HCOOH, HCHO, and CH 3 OH in the solution, were not detected by FID-GC and HPLC.These results indicate that H 2 O acted as an electron donor and the number of photogenerated electrons used in the reduction of CO 2 and H was similar to that of photogenerated holes consumed by the oxidation of H 2 O.However, the selectivity of the generated Fig. 2 UV-Vis DRS of Zn-modified Ga2O3 with various Zn loading amount.

The bare Ga 2 O 3 exhibited an absorption edge at 265 nm and the bandgap energy of Ga 2 O 3 was estimated as 4.6 eV according to the Davis-Mott's equation (F(R)hv 2 ). 20Modification of Ga 2 O 3 with different amounts of Zn species did not change the absorption edge of the spectra, thus the addition of Zn species did not contribute to the band structure of Ga 2 O 3 to alter selectivity toward CO evolution in the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 Zn-modified Ga 2 O 3 was treated at high temperature after the impregnation of Ga 2 O 3 with Zn(NO 3 ) 2 , which means that the Zn ions should either form a new compound at the surface of Ga 2 O 3 or be incorporated into the bulk structure of Ga 2 O 3 .Figure 3(A) shows the XRD patterns of bare Ga 2 O 3 and Znmodified Ga 2 O 3 with various amounts of Zn species.Ga 2 O 3 was calcined at 1273 K before the introduction of Zn species, thus all the samples exhibited the same monoclinic structure, -Ga 2 O 3 , which is a thermally stable phase of the five polymorphic phases of Ga 2 O 3 .For the addition of Zn species from 0.1 mol to 1.0 mol, the XRD patterns of Zn-modified Ga 2 O 3 were similar to that of bare Ga 2 O 3 .However, a diffraction peak representing the (311) facet of the ZnGa 2 O 4 structure was observed in the XRD pattern of 3.0 mol Znmodified Ga 2 O 3 .This indicates that the Zn species react with Ga 2 O 3 to generate ZnGa 2 O 4 , and the crystallinity of the ZnGa 2 O 4 structure in Zn-modified Ga 2 O 3 is promoted by adding higher amounts of Zn species.Furthermore, the diffraction peak of ZnGa 2 O 4 became sharper and higher as the amount of Zn species was increased.When the amount of Zn species reached 10.0 mol, the peaks for the (311), (400), (422), and (440) facets of ZnGa 2 O 4 were clearly observed.Therefore, based on the XRD results, the formation of highly crystalline ZnGa 2 O 4 may be responsible for the highly selective photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 by H 2 O, because the 3.0 mol, 5.0 mol, and 10.0 mol Zn-modified Ga 2 O 3 exhibited much higher selectivity toward CO evolution than the other samples.When a foreign metal ion is inserted into a crystal structure, the substitution of the original lattice ion or the residual stress from a new mixed compound usually results in the peak shift of the XRD pattern associated with the change in the interplanar distance.212223Figure3(B)shows the magnified XRD patterns of all samples in the 2 range from 36.0 to 40.0.The diffraction peaks of Zn-modified Ga 2 O 3 with various amounts of Zn ions did not shift significantly in comparison to those of bare Ga 2 O 3 .The ionic radius of Zn 2 (0.074 nm) is larger than that of Ga 3 (0.062 nm);21,22 however, the unaltered peak position in the XRD pattern implies that the Zn ion does not act as a dopant in the bulk Ga 2 O 3 lattice.Furthermore, this result indicates that the formation of ZnGa 2 O 4 in the Zn-modified Ga 2 O 3 with larger amounts of Zn ions did not generate enough residual stress to distort the Figure 3(B) shows the magnified XRD patterns of all samples in the 2 range from 36.0 to 40.0.The diffraction peaks of Zn-modified Ga 2 O 3 with various amounts of Zn ions did not shift significantly in comparison to those of bare Ga 2 O 3 .The ionic radius of Zn 2 (0.074 nm) is larger than that of Ga 3 (0.062 nm); 21,22 however, the unaltered peak position in the XRD pattern implies that the Zn ion does not act as a dopant in the bulk Ga 2 O 3 lattice.Furthermore, this result indicates that the formation of ZnGa 2 O 4 in the Zn-modified Ga 2 O 3 with larger amounts of Zn ions did not generate enough residual stress to distort the ARTICLE Journal Name 4 J.

Fig.8The surface ratios of Zn ions to total metal ions (Zn and Ga) and the specific surface area of Zn-modified Ga2O3 with various Zn contents. displays the dependence of the surface ratio of Zn atoms to total metal atoms (Zn and Ga), estimated by XPS measurement (FigureS1), on the ratio of the mixture in the starting material for Znmodified Ga 2 O 3 .When the amount of Zn species added increased from 0.1 mol to 1.0 mol, the surface ratio of Zn atoms to total metal atoms sharply increased from 2.4 mol to 4.8 mol.Further increase in the amount of Zn species resulted in a continuous rise in the surface ratio of Zn atoms to total metal atoms.Therefore, the high-temperature treatment of the Zn(NO 3 ) 2 -impregnated Ga 2 O 3 starting material promotes the surface reaction between Zn(NO 3 ) 2 and Ga 2 O 3 to form the ZnGa 2 O 4 layer at the surface of Ga 2 O 3 when the Zn content is higher than 0.1 mol.The coverage and thickness of the ZnGa 2 O 4 layer on the surface of Ga 2 O 3 would increase with greater loadings of Zn(NO 3 ) 2 .In addition, the specific surface area of Zn-modified Ga 2 O 3 measured by the BET method is also shown in Figure8.The surface area of the modified Ga 2 O 3 did not vary proportionally with the generation of the ZnGa 2 O 4 layer on the surface of Ga 2 O 3 ; thus, the thin ZnGa 2 O 4 layer must grow evenly on the surface of Ga 2 O 3 . 2 O 3 is related to the formation of the ZnGa 2 O 4 layer on the surface of Ga 2 O 3 .J.

Please do not adjust marginsPlease do not adjust margins Based on the above described results, it can be proposed a functioning mechanism of the modification of Ag-loaded Ga 2 O 3 with ZnGa 2 O 4 layer in the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 by H 2 O in Figure10.Undoubtedly, the photocatalytic reaction on Zn-modified Ga 2 O 3 is triggered by the absorption of photons, leading to the generation of electrons and holes in the bulk of photocatalyst.The photoexcited electrons subsequently migrate to the surface active sites to participate in the reduction of CO 2 and H , while the holes oxidize H 2 O into O 2 .The metallic Ag particle deposited on Ga 2 O 3 and Zn-modified Ga 2 O 3 photocatalysts with the similar particle size and dispersion functions as a cocatalyst to capture the photoexcited electrons for the reduction of CO 2 .Thus, similar activity for the evolution of CO over the Ag-loaded Zn-modified Ga 2 O 3 with different Zn contents (0 mol to 10 mol) is attributable to the same extraction efficiency of electrons from Ga 2 O 3 and Zn-modified Ga 2 O 3 by the Ag particles.Moreover, the crystallinity and surface area of Ga 2 O 3 are almost unaltered after modification with the ZnGa 2 O 4 layer, which maintains the formation rate of CO in the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 by H 2 O. Due to the existence of a large number of active sites for the reduction of H on the surface of Ga 2 O 3 , the evolution of H 2 is the main reaction over Ag-loaded Ga 2 O 3 (Figure 10(A)).The selectivity toward CO evolution against the H 2 production over Ag-loaded Zn(0.1 mol)-modified Ga 2 O 3 is still lower than 50, indicating that tiny amount of Zn species with ZnO structure is insufficient to block the active sites for the reduction of H .The modification of Ga 2 O 3 with Zn species conduction band of ZnGa 2 O 4 is located at more negative potential than that of Ga 2 O 3 .The combination of ZnGa 2 O 4 and Ga 2 O 3 heterostructure could facilitate the photogenerated electrons transfer from ZnGa 2 O 4 to Ga 2 O 3 , 22 which diminishes the electron density in the ZnGa 2 O 4 structure for the reduction of H .Therefore, the evolution of H 2 is suppressed with the increase of Zn content in Ag-loaded Znmodified Ga 2 O 3 .In addition, stoichiometric amount of O 2 evolved over Ag-loaded Zn-modified Ga 2 O 3 photocatalysts reveals that the formation of ZnGa 2 O 4 layer on the surface of Ga 2 O 3 keeps the H 2 O oxidation sites remaining, because higher valence band of ZnGa 2 O 4 structure leads to the migration of holes from Ga 2 O 3 to ZnGa 2 O 4 .The decrease of O 2 evolution with the introduction of Zn species is owing to the suppression of H 2 production which consumes the photoexcited electrons donated from the oxidation of H 2 O. Characterization using UV-Vis DRS, XRD, XAFS, XPS, BET and SEM measurements confirmed that a ZnGa 2 O 4 layer was generated on the surface of Ga 2 O 3 by the addition of Zn species, and the band structure, crystallinity, surface area, morphology of Ga 2 O 3 , the particle size, dispersion, and chemical state of Ag cocatalyst were not affected.The ZnGa 2 O 4 layer has a special function to suppress the reduction of H in the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 by H 2 O over Ag-loaded Zn-modified Ga 2 O 3 photocatalyst.Since the generation ratio of H 2 to CO can be finely tuned by using the Ag-loaded Znmodified Ga 2 O 3 photocatalyst, it is a promising way to produce synthesis gas through the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 by H 2 O.
