Two methods, a photodeposition method (PD) and an impregnation method (IMP), and their combinations were examined for loading of Ag and TMO x (TMO x NiO x , CoO x , FeO x ) dual cocatalysts on the CTO sample.The loading amounts in the present study were desired to be 2.0 and 0.5 wt for Ag and TMO x species, respectively, for all the samples. In the simultaneous PD method, 1 g of the CTO sample was dispersed in 360 mL of pure water containing both AgNO 3 and a required precursor such as Ni(NO 3 ) 2 .6H 2 O, Co(NO 3 ) 2 .6H 2 O and Fe(NO 3 ) 2 .6H 2 O, in an inner-irradiation-type reaction vessel, and a bubbling flow of Ar gas was used to exclude the air for 1 h before photoirradiation.Then the suspension was photoirradiated by a 100 W high-pressure Hg lamp located at the center of the vessel with a bubbling flow of Ar gas for 2.5 h.Then, the resulting suspension was filtered and dried in air at 373 K for 24 h.These samples were referred to as Ag(PD)-TMO x (PD)/CTO samples. Additional two samples were prepared by a two-step PD method, in which Ag and NiO x species were consecutively photodeposited one by one on the CTO photocatalyst: Ag species was first photodeposited on the CTO sample, followed by the photodeposition of NiO x species to give the NiO x (PD)/Ag(PD)/CTO sample, while the Ag(PD)/NiO x (PD)/CTO sample was prepared in the reverse order. In the simultaneous IMP method, the CTO sample was soaked in a solution (100 mL) containing the two precursors for Ag and TMO x and continuously stirred in a water bath at 120 rpm at 353 K to completely evaporate whole of water.Then, the resulting samples were dried in air at 373 K for 24 h, and calcined at 723 K for 1 h in the furnace.The samples were denoted as Ag(IMP)-TMO x (IMP)/CTO samples.In a combination of the IMP and PD methods, a TMO x species was first loaded by the IMP method, followed by loading Ag with the PD method, providing the Ag(PD)/TMO x (IMP)/CTO samples.The NiO x (-IMP)/Ag(PD)/CTO sample was prepared in the inverse order. The single Ag cocatalyst sample and the single TMO x cocatalyst samples were also prepared to give the Ag(PD)/CTO, TMO x (PD)/CTO, and TMO x (IMP)/CTO samples. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of all samples were recorded with a Lab X XRD-6000 (Shimadzu).Morphologies of the samples were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with a JSM-890 (JEOL).Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained with energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) by a JEOL JEM-2100F at 200 kV in the Joint Research Centre of Kindai University.Ag K-edge X-ray absorption fine structures (XAFS) were recorded at BL01B1 of SPring-8 (Hyogo, Japan) in a transmission mode with a Si(311) double crystal monochromator.The actual loaded amount of cocatalysts was evaluated by XRF with an EDX-8000 (Shimadzu) according to each calibration curve that was experimentally obtained from a series of reference samples prepared by the impregnation method.The diff ;use reflectance (DR) UV-vis spectra were measured using a V-670 (JASCO) equipped with an integrating sphere covered with BaSO 4 that was used as a reference. Photocatalytic activity test for CO 2 reduction by H 2 O was carried out using a flow system with an inner-irradiation-type reaction vessel at ambient pressure 3.The photocatalyst (0.3 g) was dispersed in ion-exchanged water (350 mL) containing 0.5 M NaHCO 3 , and then suspended using magnetically stirring in a bubbling flow of gaseous CO at a flow rate of 30 mL min -1 without radiation for 1 h.The photocatalytic reaction was performed at reaction temperature of 290 K by using a 100 W high-pressure mercury lamp with 44 mW cm -2 measured at 254 10 nm in wavelength.The amounts of evolved CO, H 2 , and O were detected by using an on-line gas chromatograph (Shimadzu, GC-8A, TCD, Shincarbon ST column, argon carrier).The CO, H 2 , and O were generated as the main products under photoirradiation, where CO was the main reductive product from CO 2 and H 2 was produced by water splitting as a competitive product 17.The selectivity toward CO evolution among the reductive products, S CO , and the ratio of the consumed electrons and holes, R(e -/h ), were calculated using the equations shown below 18, where R CO , R H2 , and R O2 describe the production rate of CO, H 2 , and O 2 , respectively. In the H 2 evolution tests, we added methanol (14 ) as an electron donor (a reductant) to make the reductive reaction to be the rate determining step, while in the O 2 evolution test NaIO 3 (10 mM) was added as an electron acceptor (an oxidant) to make the oxidative reaction to be the rate determining step."}, {"title": "Results_and_discussion", "content": "The actual loaded amount of cocatalysts was evaluated by XRF and listed in Tables S1 andS2.Although the desired loading amount in both the single and dual cocatalyst samples was 2.0 and 0.5 wt. for Ag and TMO x species, respectively, the amount of TMO x cocatalyst loaded by the PD method was actually less than the desired value.In the PD method, although Ag can be easily reduced to form metallic Ag, it is considered that photocatalytic reduction and oxidation of transition metal cations would be more difficult 19. The XRD patterns of the CTO, Ag(PD)/CTO, and Ag(PD)-TMO x (PD)/ CTO samples evidenced the formation and conservation of the CaTiO 3 perovskite crystal, and a new peak at about 38.2 assignable to Ag metal was observed after loading Ag species (Fig. 1A).However, no diffraction lines corresponding to transition metal oxide were obvious in whole samples.In these samples, the content of the transition metal oxides was very low as mentioned above, which would be lower than the detection limit in the present conditions and thus no diffraction from them was observed. Ag K-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) of the Ag (PD)/CTO sample was similar to that of Ag foil, meaning that these Ag NPs were in metallic state on this sample (Fig. 1Bc).Although XANES of other samples were not measured in this study, it is reported in our previous study that the Ag species in a silver-manganese dual cocatalyst on potassium hexatitanate photocatalyst loaded by the same photodeposition method was in metallic state according to Ag K-edge XANES 3,19.This means that the coexistence of the second cocatalyst would not significantly change the chemical state of Ag NPs in the dual cocatalyst system, suggesting that the Ag species would be metallic also in the present samples.This is supported by the XRD (Fig. 1A) as mentioned and the DR UV-vis spectra (Figs. 4 and6) as mentioned later. The SEM image of the CTO sample shown in Fig. 2a reveals that these particles consisted of the polyhedral crystal shape covered with many facets.On the Ag(PD)/CTO sample, Ag NPs were successfully distributed on the dominant facets (Fig. 2b).The SEM image of the as-synthesized Ag(PD)-NiO x (PD)/CTO sample show the presence of additional particles on the CTO crystals, although it is difficult to distinguish the Ag and NiO x species on these samples (Fig. 2c).TEM images also confirm that no NPs were found on the surface of the bare CTO sample (Fig. 2d), and the spherical Ag NPs sized in the range of 30-40 nm were loaded on the CTO surface (Fig. 2, e and f). Photocatalytic activity tests in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with water were carried out for the various samples, which were prepared with the PD method and the combination of IMP and PD methods, and results are shown in Fig. 3.The observed products were CO, H 2 , and O 2 , where CO was the reductive product from CO 2 in the aid of water, and H 2 was produced via water splitting as a competitive product (Eq. 1 and 2), respectively 8,20, and water was oxidized to O 2 (Eq.3) that is the common product of the CO 2 reduction and water splitting 12,19,21. As shown in Fig. 3a, the bare CTO sample without any cocatalyst mainly promoted water splitting with the formation of H 2 and O 2 .The Ag(PD)/CTO photocatalyst exhibited high CO formation rate (7.31 mol h -1 ) and high selectivity (S CO 96 ) by suppressing H 2 formation via water splitting (Fig. 3b).The ratio of the number of reacted electrons to that of holes was almost unity, R(e -/h ) 1.06, suggesting that both the reductive and oxidative products were observed in a stoichiometric ratio.Compared with the Ag(PD)/CTO sample, the dual cocatalyst loaded Ag(PD)-TMO x (PD)/CTO samples prepared by the simultaneous PD method exhibited comparable or less CO production rates and higher H 2 formation rates (Fig. 3c-e).The selectivity of the reductive products depended on the composition of the cocatalysts.Among them, the Ag (PD)-NiO x (PD)/CTO sample showed the moderately high activity for both CO and H 2 productions (Fig. 3c), where the CO selectivity S CO was 58 .In contrast, the Ag(PD)-CoO x (PD)/CTO and Ag(PD)-FeO x (PD)/ CTO samples gave lower S CO (Fig. 3d ande), and the latter sample dominantly produced H 2 with very low S CO (7.5 ). The samples prepared by the combination of the IMP and PD methods, Ag(PD)/TMO x (IMP)/CTO samples, exhibited higher H 2 formation rate than the Ag(PD)-TMOx(PD)/CTO samples (Fig. 3, f-h).To confirm the property of the transition metal species, the TMO x single cocatalyst loaded samples, TMO x (PD)/CTO and TMO x (IMP)/CTO, were also prepared and examined in the photocatalytic reaction test (Fig. S1).These photocatalysts could not produce CO at all, indicating the Ag cocatalyst is intrinsically required for CO 2 reduction to CO and these transition metal oxides cannot function as the cocatalyst for CO formation from CO 2 .Among these single cocatalyst loaded photocatalysts, the samples prepared by the IMP method (Fig. S1, f-h) showed higher activity for water splitting than the samples prepared by the PD method (Fig. S1, c-e), which might be due to the larger loading amount as shown in Table S1.These properties of the TMO x single cocatalyst loaded photocatalyst (Fig. S1) are somewhat similar to the Ag(PD)-TMO x dual cocatalyst loaded photocatalyst (Fig. 3) except for the CO formation.Thus, the TMO x species in the dual cocatalyst would contribute to the water splining only.In addition, it is found that the TMO x species in the dual cocatalyst loaded samples (Fig. 3) exhibited higher activities than those in the TMO x (IMP)/CTO samples (Fig. S1), suggesting that TMOx species coexisting with Ag NPs prepared by the PD method have high activity for water splitting.The impregnation method would certainly form the transition metal oxide species while the following photoirradiation might partially form reduced state of the TMO x species.In the DR UV-vis spectra (Fig. 4), the Ag(PD)/TMO x (IMP)/CTO samples exhibited the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) bands of Ag NPs at the position around 380-530 nm in wavelength, which is similar to the Ag(PD)/CTO sample, confirming that Ag NPs were present in these samples, and they would almost be in a similar state, regardless of the presence of the metal oxide species (Fig. 4).This propose that the Ag NPs are independently present with the TMO x species. In contrast to reduction products (H 2 and CO), the O 2 evolution was insufficient in induction period (4.5 h light illumination) for all the Ag-TMO x dual cocatalyst loaded CTO photocatalysts.One may think that one possible reason is the difficulty of water oxidation due to the high overpotential of O 2 evolution, which probably originate from the formation of deep trapping and stabilization of positive charge by the surface sites 22,23.However, if holes are not consumed, the formation of reductive products (CO and H 2 ) should be significantly prohibited.And it was the fact that reductive products were observed.These facts suggest that a certain oxidative reaction by holes would take place on the surface of catalyst.Thus, other possibilities should be considered for this phenomenon.One is that produced O 2 may be dissolved in the aqueous NaHCO 3 solution, or adsorbed on the catalyst surface 20 and another is that some competitive side reactions may occur 20,24.As mentioned later, the O 2 evolution increased with time on the Ag (PD)-TMO x (PD)/CTO sample (Fig. 5B), suggesting that the produced O 2 might be dissolved in the solution, adsorbed on the catalyst surface, or stored as different intermediates such as H 2 O 2 .As for this point, further investigations are required. Some Ag-NiO x /CTO samples were prepared by different preparation methods and examined for the photocatalytic activity tests (Fig. 5A).The Ag(PD)-NiO x (PD)/CTO and Ag(PD)/NiO x (IMP)/CTO samples provided moderately high CO formation as mentioned above (Fig. 5A, a and b and also Fig. 3, c andf) although the latter showed higher activity for H 2 formation.These samples had the photodeposited Ag NPs showing the LSPR bands (Fig. 6) although the state of the NiO x species would be different due to the difference of the preparation methods.Thus, the photocatalytic activity of Ag NPs for reduction of CO 2 to CO was not so related to the state of the NiO x species.The Ag(IMP)-NiO x (IMP)/CTO sample showed low photocatalytic activity for both CO 2 reduction and water splitting (Fig. 5Ac).In this sample prepared by the simultaneous IMP method, both Ag and Ni species were oxidized, and they possibly would be mixed together to have interaction, resulting less activity.The NiO x (IMP)/Ag(PD)/CTO sample (Fig. 5Ad) exhibited high H 2 formation rate and much less CO formation rate, and did not exhibit clear LSPR bands due to Ag NPs and the broad band would be assignable to the NiO x species (Fig. 6).These results clarified that the independently existing NiO x species can act as cocatalyst for water splitting and the Ag species that was oxidized by the calcination at the second step cannot function as cocatalyst for CO 2 reduction to form CO. Additional two samples, NiO x (PD)/Ag(PD)/CTO and Ag(PD)/ NiO x (PD)/CTO, were prepared by a consecutive two-step PD method and examined for the photocatalytic reaction test (Fig. S2).These samples also exhibited highly enhanced photocatalytic activities, which were similar to that of the Ag(PD)-NiO x (PD)/CTO sample prepared by the simultaneous PD method.This result indicates that the effect of photodepositted NiO x species on photocatalytic activity was not related to the order of the photodeposition, which is in accordance with our previous results 19. Based on these observations, we can conclude that the metallic Ag NPs prepared by the PD method can function as selective cocatalyst for CO formation, while the TMO x cocatalysts can contribute to water splitting more effectively when they are prepared by the impregnation method and present independently with Ag species. The O 2 evolution recorded in the initial period (4.5 h) was insufficient for these samples, resulting in the very high R(e -/h ) values.However, the production rate of O 2 over the Ag(PD)-NiO x (PD)/CTO photocatalyst gradually increased with irradiation time and thus more stoichiometric production of reductive and oxidative products was continuously observed after irradiation of 12.5 h for (Fig. 5b). To figure out the role of NiO x , CoO x and FeO x in H 2 production, H evolution test for whole of single and dual cocatalyst loaded on CTO was also performed in the presence of methanol as an electron donor, and results are shown in Fig. 7A.The results obtained from H 2 evolution test shows that high H 2 yieldsof 467 mol, 408 mol and 351 mol for 7.5 h were obtained with a single FeO x , CoO x and NiO x cocatalyst, respectively, which were 1.22-fold, 1.14-fold and 1.32-fold higher than those with the dual cocatalyst loaded photocatalysts: Ag(PD)/FeO x (IMP)/CTO (381 mol), Ag(PD)/CoO x (IMP)/CTO (358 mol), and Ag(PD)/NiO x (-IMP)/CTO (265 mol).The bare CTO and Ag(PD)/CTO samples showed the H 2 formation of 161 and 96 mol, respectively, for 7.5 h, which were lower than that those with TMO x .This means that the Ag NPs is effective cocatalyst not for water splitting but for CO 2 reduction 8.The higher H 2 evolution activity with a single TMO x co-catalyst than the Ag-TMO x dual cocatalyst, proposed that the coexistence of Ag NPs inhibited the H production 25. To clarify the role of the TMO x species in O 2 production, oxygen evolution test was also performed for whole of single and dual cocatalyst loaded on CTO and the results are shown in Fig. 7B.The bare CTO sample was active towards water oxidation, with the corresponding O evolution amount reaching 573 mol after 2 h of illumination, suggesting that surface of bare CTO sample provides suitable sites for water oxidation.In the case of the Ag(PD)/CTO sample, no apparent increase in O 2 evolution amount was observed as compared to bare CTO sample, meaning that Ag cocatalyst can be considered as a promising candidate for the reduction of CO 2 to CO, and only hole from the CTO photocatalyst was active towards water oxidation.The O 2 evolution performances of the samples with a single FeO x , CoO x , and NiO x cocatalyst were 767, 736, and 667 mol, respectively, which were higher than those with the dual cocatalyst loaded photocatalysts: Ag(PD)/ FeO x (IMP)/CTO (652 mol), Ag(PD)/CoO x (IMP)/CTO (637 mol), and Ag(PD)/NiO x (IMP)/CTO (614 mol).This means that the addition of Ag NPs seems to decrease O 2 evolution formation.These results are consistent with the previous H 2 evolution results with the single FeO x , CoO x and NiO x cocatalysts, where active sites for H 2 evolution were reduced by Ag species (Fig. 7A).Moreover, the O 2 evolution performances of the samples with the single TMO x co-catalysts or the Ag-TMO x dual cocatalysts were also higher than that with the bare CTO (573 mol) and Ag/CTO (534 mol) photocatalysts.Enhanced O 2 evolution performance in the presence of TMO x species can be ascribed to the effective role of TMO x as an oxide-based cocatalysts in facilitating the charge carrier separation and/or acting as water oxidation sites, in accordance with other literature reports 26,27.These results represented that the sample with a single TMO x cocatalyst showed higher activity in both the H 2 evolution and O 2 evolution test with each sacrifice reagent.Moreover, the coexistence of Ag NPs species would diminish the active sites for both H 2 and O 2 evolutions. Here, we propose a mechanism for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction into CO on the Ag-TMO x dual cocatalyst loaded CTO photocatalyst.In the case of the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with water on the Ag/CTO photocatalyst, the Ag cocatalyst can receive the photoexcited electrons from the conduction band of the CTO and function as a reduction sites predominantly for production of CO as shown in Eq. ( 1) 8 (Scheme 1A).On the Ag-TMO x /CTO photocatalyst, the coexistence of the Ag and TMO x species in the dual cocatalyst on the CTO photocatalyst was beneficial for both CO 2 reduction and waters splitting with the formation of a significant amount of H 2 as a second reductive product via water splitting, where the two reactions competitively proceeded.However, the actual role of these transition metal oxide species as cocatalysts for overall water splitting is still under debate.It has been proposed that transition metal can be reformulated as oxidized species, TMO x , on the CTO photocatalyst, in which the TMO x species actually functions as the proton reduction sites to produce H 2 and as the water oxidation sites to produce O 2 (Scheme 1B).Zhang et al. studied the critical role of NiO x cocatalyst for overall water splitting using NaTaO 3 as photocatalyst 28.They found that although NiO was solely deposited on the surface of NaTaO 3 , the presence of both metallic Ni and NiO was observed during photocatalytic reaction, and the actual roles of metallic Ni as an electron trap (the catalytic sites for proton reduction) and NiO as a hole trap (the catalytic sites for water oxidation) were confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy.However, the main role of TMO x as the surface reaction sites in water splitting as well as the facet charge separation are not well clarified and need to be further studied."}, {"title": "Conclusions", "content": "In this study, the effects of the Ag-TMO x dual cocatalyst (TM Fe, Co, Ni) and the loading methods on the activity of the CTO photocatalyst for CO 2 conversion to CO and O 2 and water splitting to H 2 and O 2 were investigated and the following matters were clarified.1) Compared to the single Ag co-catalyst, the Ag-TMO x dual cocatalyst provided a comparable or less activity for CO evolution and a higher activity for H 2 evolution.2) The photocatalytic activity depended on the loading methods.The photodeposition method gave higher activity for CO formation and the impregnation method gave higher activity for H 2 formation.3) A TMO x cocatalyst can improve the activity of the CTO photocatalyst for water splitting to form H 2 and O 2 while the Ag cocatalyst can improve the activity for not the water splitting but CO 2 reduction.
