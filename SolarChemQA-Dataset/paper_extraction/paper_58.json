Their photocatalytic activities for reducing CO 2 to CH 3 OH under visible light irradiation have been investigated.The results indicated that besides a small quantity of 6H-SiC, SiC NPs mainly consisted of 3C-SiC.The band gaps of SiC and Cu 2 O were estimated to be about 1.95 and 2.23 eV from UV-Vis spectra, respectively.The Cu 2 O modification can enhance the photocatalytic performance of SiC NPs, and the largest yields of methanol on SiC, Cu 2 O and Cu 2 O/SiC photocatalysts under visible light irradiation were 153, 104 and 191mol/g, respectively."}, {"title": "Experimental", "content": "All of the chemical reagents used in this experiment were analytical grade and used without further purification.Commercial SiC NPs with the size of 40-50 nm were obtained from Aladdin. The synthesis of Cu 2 O was performed according to the method reported by Wang et al. 21.In a typical preparation process, CuSO The specific surface area, pore volume, and average pore diameter of the photocatalysts were measured by nitrogen adsorption at the liquid nitrogen temperature of 77 K with the help of an ASAP 2010 volumetric adsorption analyzer (Micromeritics Instrument Corp. USA) 22,23.The morphology of the photocatalysts was observed on scanning electron microscope (SEM, LEO 1530VP Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope, LEO Electron Microscopy Inc., Germany).The XRD patterns were obtained at room temperature using a MSAL-XD2 diffractometer with Cu K radiation (operated at 36 kV and 30 mA, 0.15406 nm).The UV-Vis spectra in range of the 200-800 nm were measured using a Daojin UV-2550PC Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscope.The XPS spectra were collected by a Kratos AXis Ultra (DLD) with pass energy of 20 eV, and the excitation of the spectra was performed by means of monochromatized Mg K radiation.Correction of the energy shifts due to static charging of the samples was accomplished by referring to the C 1s line from the residual pump-line oil contamination taken at 284.6 eV. The photocatalytic activities were performed in a XPA-II photochemical reactor (Nanjing Xujiang Machine-electronic Plant), equipped with magnetic stirrer, quartz cool trap and condensation tube.A 500 W Xe lamp was located in the quartz cool trap as illuminant.The wavelength of Xe lamp ranged from 200 to 700 nm.The UV light under 400 nm was removed by a 2.0 M sodium nitrite solution (NaNO 2 ) 20.Firstly, NaOH (0.8 g) and absolute sodium sulfite (Na 2 SO 3 , 2.52 g) were dissolved in 200 mL distilled water.This solution was then put into a photochemical reaction instrument.Before irradiation, ultrapure CO 2 was bubbled through the solution in the reactor for at least 30 min to ensure that all dissolved oxygen was eliminated.Then, 200 mg of catalyst powder was added into above solution, and the irradiation lamp was turned on to start the photoreaction.Ultrapure CO 2 was continuously bubbled through the above solution in the reactor during the whole irradiation.The radiation time was 5 h.A needle-type probe was inserted into the solution in the reactor to withdraw a small amount of liquid sample at 1 h, 2 h, 2.5 h, 3 h, 3.5 h, 4 h, 4.5 h and 5 h, respectively.The concentration of methanol in the samples was analyzed using a GC9560 gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector and a stainless steel packed column (Porapak-Q, 2 mm3 m)."}, {"title": "Results_and_discussion", "content": "The nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms of three photocatalysts are shown in Figure 1.It is seen from Figure 1 that all photocatalysts gave type IV isotherms according to the BET classification 24.And each isotherm showed a distinct hysteresis loop, which is associated with the capillary condensation taking place in mesopores, indicating that all photocatalysts are mesoporous 25,26.The specific surface area (S BET ), total pore volume (V total ), and average pore diameter (d average ) of the three photocatalysts are summarized in Table 1.It can be seen from Table 1 that all the photocatalysts examined in the present study were mesoporous materials according to IUPAC classification 24.It was also noticed that Cu 2 O/SiC photocatalyst had larger total pore volume and average pore diameter, but smaller specific surface area, compared with the other two photocatalysts.This suggests that surface modification with Cu 2 O increases the average pore diameter and decreases the specific surface area.It can be attributed to the formation of Cu 2 O on the surface of SiC which probably resulted in the complete filling of the small pores, and enlarging of the average pore diameter 27. The XRD patterns of the three photocatalysts are shown in Figure 3.It was observed from Figure 3 that there were three sharp peaks at 35.7 o , 60.0 o and 71.5 o , and two small peaks at 34.1 o and 41.5 o , respectively, in the patterns of SiC and Cu 2 O/SiC 28,29.According to JCPDS cards of No.29-1129 and No.29-1131, three sharp peaks are consistent with the peak positions of 3C-SiC (111), 3C-SiC (220) and 3C-SiC (311), while two small peaks are consistent with the peak positions of 6H-SiC (110) and 6H-SiC (101), respectively.The XRD patterns show that the main phase of SiC NPs is cubic SiC (3C-SiC), although there exists a few hexagonal SiC (6H-SiC). It was also seen from Figure 3 that five peaks in the XRD spectrum of the Cu 2 O were in good agreement with the reported results 21.There were five peaks with 2 values of 29.6 o , 36.5 o , 42.4 o , 61.5 o , and 73.7 o , corresponding to the crystal planes of (110), ( 111), ( 200), ( 220) and (311) of crystalline Cu 2 O, respectively.And in other studies, it has been concluded that Cu 2 O exposing (111) facets can be used as a stable photocatalyst 30. It was also seen from Figure 3 that peaks of Cu 2 O/SiC were distinctly similar to those for pure SiC, indicating that SiC has no obvious change in the modification.Three small peaks of Cu 2 O were also found in the pattern of Cu 2 O/SiC, which was caused by the small loading amount of Cu 2 O, so that the peaks of Cu 2 O in Cu 2 O/SiC were very weak 31.This also shows that Cu 2 O may be compounded with the SiC, which can be further confirmed by XPS analysis. The UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra of various photocatalysts are shown in Figure 4.As shown in Figure 4, the SiC NPs had photoabsorption from UV light to visible light, and there were two marked absorption edges, which were about 410 and 560 nm, respectively.The optical band gaps can be determined by the following equation using the optical absorption data near the band edge 32: where, a, , A, and E g are the absorption coefficient, light frequency, proportionality constant and band gap, respectively.Following this method, the two values of band gap for SiC were estimated to be 2.23 and 3.02 eV, which are in good agreement with the reported values of 2.2 eV (for 3C-SiC) and 3.0 eV (for 6H-SiC) 33, respectively.This further indicates that the SiC NPs contain both 6H-SiC and 3C-SiC.Similarly, the value of band gap for Cu 2 O was estimated to be about 1.95 eV, which is close to the reported values of 2.0 eV (for Cu 2 O) 19,20.And it was also noticed that loading of Cu 2 O can obviously enhance the absorbance of SiC under visible light.Therefore, it remarkably shows that all the prepared photocatalysts are suitable for absorbing visible light from Xe lamp, and the photocatalytic activity of SiC NPs was improved through the loading of Cu 2 O. Figure 5 shows the C 1s and Si 2p patterns of XPS for SiC NPs, and Cu 2p 3/2 and Cu 2p 1/2 patterns of XPS for Cu 2 O/SiC and Cu 2 O.It can be seen from Figure 5(a) that C 1s main peak of XPS spectra for SiC NPs exhibited an asymmetric line shape, indicating that there were different types of carbon existing on the surface of SiC NPs.The C 1s main peak of XPS spectra could be split into three sub-peaks at about 282.8, 283.5 and 284.4 eV, which were ascribed to Si-C 34, Si 1-x C x alloy (0.5x0.6) 35 and C-C (surface adsorption of carbon), respectively.The peak at about 287.2 eV was attributed to C-O 36, which may be due to the impurities in SiC NPs.It could also be seen from Figure 5(b) that Si 2p peak of XPS spectra for SiC also exhibited an asymmetric line shape with the noticeable structure of high binding energy shoulder that can be due to the SiO x species on the SiC surface 35.The binding energy of 99.5 and 100.3 eV may correspond to Si-C bond in Si 1-x C x alloy(0.5x0.6)and 3C-SiC 35, respectively.It also can be noticed from The morphologies of the photocatalysts were observed by SEM as shown in Figure 6.It can be seen from Figure 6 The photocatalytic activities of the three photocatalysts are shown in Figure 7. From Figure 7, it can be seen that both SiC NPs and Cu 2 O had good photocatalytic activities and can be used as the photocatalyst for reducing CO 2 to CH 3 OH.This was because the potentials of conduction band of SiC and Cu 2 O are more negative than all those of methanol yield for CO 2 (g), H 2 CO 3 , CO 2- 3 etc. in water 8,37.The detailed band structures were inset in Figure 7 1,19,20.Although the photoabsorption performances of Cu 2 O were better than those of SiC, it can be seen that the yield of methanol on SiC was larger than that on Cu 2 O, which may be attributed that SiC has much larger average pore diameter and smaller particle sizes 38.The existence of macrochannels and larger external surface areas can increase photoabsorption efficiency and allow efficient diffusion of gaseous molecules.In addition, it can be also seen from Figure 7 that all the yields of CH 3 OH increased with increasing the time of visible light irradiation, and Cu 2 O/SiC had the best photocatalytic performance.The largest yields of methanol on SiC, Cu 2 O and Cu 2 O/SiC photocatalysts under visible light irradiation were 153, 104 and 191 mol/g, respectively.This was because that doping Cu 2 O to SiC can improve the separation of electrons and holes, and prolong the lifetime of charge carrier, therefore, the photocatalytic activity of photocatalyst is enhanced."}, {"title": "Conclusions", "content": "The 5H 2 O (3.3 g) was dissolved in 400 mL deionized water, and 20 mL NaOH aqueous solution (1.5 M) was added under vigorous stirring.After stirring for 15 min, 1.5 mL N 2 H 4 H 2 O aqueous solution (13.7 M) was added dropwise into the blue Cu(OH) 2 colloidal solution with constant stirring.After the blue precipitates were completely reduced by N 2 H 4 H 2 O, they turned into red.Then the red precipitates were filtered, washed with distilled water for several times, and finally dried in a vacuum oven at 60 C for 3 h.The preparation of Cu 2 O/SiC photocatalysts was similar to that of Cu 2 O. SiC NPs (3 g) and CuSO 4 5H 2 O (0.52 g) were dispersed in 400 mL deionized water, then precipitated by 20 mL 1.5 M NaOH solution and reduced by N 2 H 4 H 2 O.The obtained samples were dried in a vacuum oven at 60 C for 3 h. Figure 1.N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms on the three photocatalysts at 77 K Figure 2 shows the DFT pore size distributions of three photocatalysts.It is noticed that there was an obvious pore size distribution in the mesopore region for each photocatalyst, and a distinct peak could be seen in the DFT pore size distribution of Cu 2 O and Cu 2 O/SiC photocatalyst, respectively.It means that the mesopores are dominant for the three photocatalysts.The specific surface area (S BET ), total pore volume (V total ), and average pore diameter (d average ) of the three photocatalysts are summarized in Table1.It can be seen from Figure 2.

Figure 5 shows the C 1s and Si 2p patterns of XPS for SiC NPs, and Cu 2p 3/2 and Cu 2p 1/2 patterns of XPS for Cu 2 O/SiC and Cu 2 O.It can be seen from Figure5(a) that C 1s main peak of XPS spectra for SiC NPs exhibited an asymmetric line shape, indicating that there were different types of carbon existing on the surface of SiC NPs.The C 1s main peak of XPS spectra could be split into three sub-peaks at about 282.8, 283.5 and 284.4 eV, which were ascribed to Si-C34, Si 1-x C x alloy (0.5x0.6)35 and C-C (surface adsorption of carbon), respectively.The peak at about 287.2 eV was attributed to C-O36, which may be due to the impurities in SiC NPs.It could also be seen from Figure5(b) that Si 2p peak of XPS spectra for SiC also exhibited an asymmetric line shape with the noticeable structure of high binding energy shoulder that can be due to the SiO x species on the SiC surface35.The binding energy of 99.5 and 100.3 eV may correspond to Si-C bond in Si 1-x C x alloy(0.5x0.6)and 3C-SiC35, respectively.It also can be noticed from Figure 5(d) that the Cu 2p 3/2 peak exhibited asymmetric shape with a high binding energy tail, indicating that a small amount of Cu 2 O has been oxidized into CuO due to the instability of Cu 2 O in the air.Figure 5(c) confirmed that Cu 2 O existed in the sample of Cu 2 O/SiC and the loading amount was about 3.13 (mass concentration).The loading amount was very small and can be optimized in the future studies.
