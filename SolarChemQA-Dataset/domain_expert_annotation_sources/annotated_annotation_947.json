The H-TiO 2 was synthesized according to the literature reported by Tan's group 28.In a typical synthesis procedure, 2.0 g TiO 2 (Anatase) was mixed with 0.75 g NaBH 4 followed by 30 mins grind in order to realize thorough mixing.The mixture was then put inside a porcelain boat without any cover, then the boat was placed inside a tubular furnace and being heated from room temperature to 350 C at a heating rate of 5 C min -1 in Ar atmosphere.The sample was maintained at 350 C for 1 h and then got naturally cooled down to room temperature.In order to remove excessive NaBH 4 , deionized water (Milli-Q 18.2 Mcm at 25 C) and ethanol were used to dissolve unreacted NaBH 4 .Final product was collected after drying the sample at 70 C in vacuum for 12 h.As-prepared sample was denoted as H-TiO 2 .Fig. S1 shows the synthetic procedures for H-TiO 2 . 2.3.Synthesis of TiO 2 50 Cu and H-TiO 2 50 Cu ALD (atomic layer deposition) of copper was referred from Claudia's group 26,27.For materials used in deposition, Cu(hfac) 2 and deionized water were used as Cu precursor and reducing agent, respectively.Firstly, 100 mg TiO 2 and H-TiO 2 were spread uniformly in a homemade ALD powder container covered by 400 mesh stainless steel net to prevent the powder from being blowing away during ALD deposition.ALD parameters for Cu deposition were as followed: substrate temperature was set to 280 C, source temperature was set to 150 C, purge flux was maintained at 30 sccm and 10 sccm for Cu source and H 2 O, respectively.In a typical four-step ALD cycle, 5 s Cu pulse and 1 s water pulse were separated by 50 s Ar purge to ensure both enough Cu source exposure and clean-up.50 cycles were employed to deposit Cu on TiO 2 and H-TiO 2 .Samples collected after ALD were denoted as TiO 2 50 Cu and H-TiO 2 50 Cu, respectively.10 cycles and 25 cycles were also employed to synthesize TiO 2 Cu and H-TiO 2 Cu.Fig. S1 shows the synthetic procedures for TiO 2 Cu and H-TiO 2 Cu. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) was performed by a Bruker AXS D8 with Cu K radiation ( 1.5406A).Element mapping of the samples was analyzed using scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi S-4800).Transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL-2100) was used to investigate morphology.X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed by a Thermo Fisher Scientific (Esclab 250) spectrometer and the results were corrected by C 1 s peak at 284.8 eV.UV-vis absorption spectra were carried out on a Shimadzu UV 2600 UV spectrophotometer possessing integrating sphere.Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) was performed by Agilent 7800. The process of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was as followed: The sample (10 mg) was spread into a round cap with diameter equal to about 3 cm, then transferred the cap into a home-made cylindrical reactor (volume 45 ml) for photocatalytic evaluation, injected 1 ml deionized water outside the perimeter of cap and then perfectly sealed the reactor with a flat quartz glass on the top.High-purity CO 2 with a flow rate of 30 ml min -1 was continuously fed into the reactor for 15 min and kept the reactor sealed in the dark for 30 min before placing the reactor underneath a 300 W Xe arc lamp (CEL-HXF300, Beijing China Education Au-light Co., Ltd) without any filter.The distance between light source and the sample was about 10 cm.The temperature of the entire system was controlled at 20 C by water-cooling system.0.2 ml gas was extracted hourly by a syringe and then analyzed by GC-7920 gas chromatograph (FID detector, YQ1229 column). In our experiments, different reduction products were detected including CO and CH 4 .Even though H 2 reduced from water is regarded as competing reaction product versus CO 2 reduction, negligible amount of H 2 could be detected by chromatograph in comparsion with CO and CH 4 .Thus, the simplfied equation for selectivity calculation only includes two electrons and eight electrons transfer processes in which n is number of moles for CO or CH 4 29.
