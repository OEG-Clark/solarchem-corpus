X-ray photo-electron spectroscopy (XPS) data were collected with ESCALAB II XPS system. All spectra were calibrated by 284.5 eV of C 1s.To obtain the shape of the particles, the analyses of scanning electron microscope (SEM) were carried out on Hitachi S4800 and JSM-5610LV.The structure and morphology of the samples were further measured by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM).The surface functional groups of the specimens were checked by Thermo Nicolet Nexus spectrometer combined In-situ test equipment.PL emission spectra were obtained by a fluorescence spectrophotometer (RF-5301PC).The UV-vis diffuse reflectance (DRS) spectra of the materials were tested by UV-2550 (Shimadzu, Japan). The photocatalytic performance of the samples was investigated by the reduction of CO2 with H2O using 300 W Xe lamp as irradiation source, carrying out in a self-designed glassware photoreactor (volume 500 mL).Desired amount (50 mg) of particles and an appropriate amount of water was added into a glass culture dish (60 mm), ultrasonically spread the sample evenly and then placed the culture dish in an oven for drying.Prior to light irradiation, the reactor was vacuum treated, and then the CO2 in reactor was produced by the reaction of NaHCO3 and concentrated H2SO4.After that, 3 mL deionized water were injected into the reactor followed by the switch on of light.At given interval time, 200 L of reacted gas were withdrawn to check products using GC-7820.The detailed process of photocatalytic reduction of CO2 is shown in figure S1. The electronic properties of the samples were calculated by the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) referred to DFT with PBE functional of GGA.The unit cell parameters of the samples were optimized with the residual force of less than 0.05 eV/A, the iterative energy variation was less than 10 -5 eV, and the cutoff energy of wave functions was set as 500 eV.", "vote": "1"}]}}
