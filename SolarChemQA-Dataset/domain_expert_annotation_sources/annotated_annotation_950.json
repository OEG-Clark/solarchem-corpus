Photocatalytic hydrogen generation experiments were carried out in a 150 mL optical reaction vessel using a 300 W Xe-lamp (Beijing PerfectLight, Microsolar300) with a 420 nm cutoff filter as the light source and stirred at 5 C by flowing the cold water to control the temperature during the reaction.

Then the suspension in the reaction vessel was fixed, stirred, purged with Ar gas for 60 min to remove air, and irradiated by the Xe lamp with a 420 nm cutoff filter.", "context": "All of the chemical reagents were purchased from Aladdin Industrial Corporation and directly used without further treatment.The holey carbon nitride catalyst modified by N-acetylethanolamine (denoted as HCN-NEA) was fabricated by two steps, as shown in Fig. 1a.Typically, 6 g of dicyandiamide (DCDA) was added into a 30 mL aqueous solution with 0.30 mL N-acetylethanolamine (NEA) and stirred for 30 min.Then, the mixture suspension was transferred into a 50 mL stainless steel autoclave (Teflon-lined) and heated to 180 C and maintained for 10 h in an oven.After dried the obtained white precipitate by freeze-drying process, proceeding them with the thermal polymerization process which were heated to 600 C at a raising rate of 10 C/min and maintained for 4 h at the static air atmosphere in a muffle furnace, and eventually produced the target PCN sample, named as HCN-NEA.And the PCN based samples via the addition of different content of NEA, such as 0.10, 0.20, 0.30 and 0.40 mL by using the same synthesis condition were also prepared, denoted as HCN-NEA I , HCN-NEA II , HCN-NEA III , and HCN-NEA IV .Noted that HCN-NEA signifies HCN-NEA III , unless especially pointed out.For comparison, holey carbon nitride (HCN) was prepared without adding NEA under the above mentioned two steps.And a bulk carbon nitride sample (denoted BCN) and the bulked CN with the modification by 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 mL NEA (denoted BCN-NEA II , BCN-NEA III , and BCN-NEA IV ) were synthesized from 6 g DCDA in a muffle furnace at 600 C/4 h with a raising rate of 10 C/ min.Usually, BCN-NEA signifies BCN-NEA III , unless especially pointed out. The crystalline structure and chemical functional group in the material were performed by employing a Rigaku Smartlab SE X-ray diffractometer (XRD) and a Bruker Vertx 70 Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) absorption spectrophotometer (FTIR).X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted by using Kratos Axis Ultra DLD with an Al Ka radiation to confirm the chemical constitution and valence state of the catalyst.The specific surface area and pore distribution were studied by N 2 adsorption/desorption isotherm recorded at 77 K by a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 apparatus.The morphology and microstructure were observed using a fieldemission scanning Hitachi S-4800 SU8220 Scanning electron microscope (SEM), JEM-2100 JEOL transmission electron microscope (TEM, 200 kV) and Bruker Multimode 8 Atomic force microscopy (AFM).Elementary analysis (EA) of C/N/H was conducted by Elementar Vario EL cube.UVevis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were measured by using a Hitachi F-4600 UVevis spectrometer spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 300e800 nm with a white standard of BaSO 4 as a reference.Photoluminescence (PL) mission spectra were collected from a Hitachi F-4600 fluorescence spectrometer with an excitation wavelength of 370 nm.Photoluminescence time-resolved anisotropy decays (PL-decay) were recorded on an Edinburgh PLS980 fluorescence spectrometer by utilizing time-correlated single-photon count.Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) data were recorded from a PHI 5000 VersaProbe III (Scanning ESCA Microprobe) SCA (Spherical Analyzer), using a He I (21.22 eV) as monochromatic discharge light source.A sample bias of A5 V was applied to investigate the secondary electron cutoff.The work function was determined by the difference between the photon energy (21.2 eV) and the binding energy of the secondary cutoff edge.The Pt concentration is investigated by using Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS, Agilent Technologies 8800, ICP-MS triple Quad).Contact angle measurements were performed by using Dataphysics OCA20. Solid electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy was conducted from a Bruker model A 300 spectrometer at room temperature with a settled microwave power of 19.1 dB and the microwave frequency of 10.1 GHz, and the analyzed samples were quantitative measured with 50 mg.Electron spin resonance (ESR) signals of the reactive hydroxyl radicals (OH) was examined by the probe molecule 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) at room temperature, equipped with a light source of 300 W Xe-lamp (l 420 nm).Electronic structure calculations of ordered and disordered repeated triazine units for the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels were evaluated by using the Gaussian program with B3LYP-D3BJ/6-31G (d) level of theory.The ordered structure corresponds to the planar structure, which is obtained without any geometry constraints, and the disordered structure was modelled by constraining the dihedral angles between adjacent aromatic rings to 90 . The femtosecond transient absorption (fs-TA) spectroscopy measurements were conducted by a Helios pump-probe system (Ultrafast Systems LLC) and equipped with an amplified femtosecond laser system (Coherent).The optical parametric amplifier with a 365 nm pump pulse (TOPAS-800-fs) was divided into multiple light beams.One was excited on a Ti: sapphire regenerative amplifier (Legend Elite-1K-HE; 800 nm, 35 fs, 7 mJ/pulse, 1 kHz), and the other was seeded by a mode-locked Ti: sapphire laser system (Micra 5), together with an Nd: YLF laser (EvolutIon 30) pumped.The temporal delay between them is dominated through a motorized optical delay stage.The pump and probe pulses overlapped spatially of the analyzed sample, and then the transmitted spectral profiles were gathered by using an optical fiber-coupled multichannel spectrometer and further proceeded by the Surface Xplorer software. Photoelectrochemical measurements were conducted on an electrochemical workstation (Chenhua CHI660E) using a standard three-electrode system with a working electrode, a Pt foil counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode.Working electrodes were prepared by dropping 100 mL of the resultant sample mixture slurry (5 mg of catalyst and 20 mL of Nafion solution in 1 mL ethanol solvent) onto the FTO glass electrode (1.0 A 2.0 cm 2 ) with 1 cm 2 active area, followed annealing at 150 C for 2 h.The photoelectrochemical measurements were performed with a 300 W Xe lamp light source and 0.2 M Na 2 SO 4 aqueous solution as the electrolyte solutions of which containing the buffer solution of 0.2 M NaH 2 PO 4 and Na 2 HPO 4 .The transient photocurrent responsive signals under cyclic chopped light and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were measured at a bias potential of A0.2 V.The Mott-Schottky plots were carried out by using three different frequency of the AC potential at 2000, 3000 and 4000 Hz to evaluate the flat potential.The donor carrier concentration could be calculated from the following equation (1) 38: where e signifies the elemental charge of 1.6 A 10 A19 C, A represents the active area of work electrode, 0 is the permittivity of vacuum of 8.85 A 10 A14 F/cm, is the relative permittivity which the value is 5.5 for PCN.The value of kT/e is generally ignored as it is too low.

For measurement, the monochromatic light by using the bandpass filter with the precision of l 10 nm was employed, including the 385 nm, 420 nm, 450 nm, 485 nm, 535 nm, and 595 nm.The amount of H 2 evolution was collected after the light irradiation for 60 min.AQE under the different wavelengths irradiation was calculated based on the following equation ( 2) and ( 3): The number of H 2 molecules can be calculated from the generation rate of H 2 under 420 nm is 136.62 mmolh A1 .Thus, the received electron number of the products: 2 A 136.62 A 10 A6 / 3600 14 7.59 A 10 A8 mols A1 . According to hc/l, the energy of the single-photon at l 14 420 nm is calculated to be 4.736 A 10 A19 J, h and c are the Planck constant 6.63 A 10 A34 Js and the speed of light 3 A 10 8 m/s.Avogadro's number is 6.022 A 10 23 .The light intensity was measured to be 7.15 mW/cm 2 by calibrating with a light power meter.The radius of the illumination area of the reactor was 3.5 cm.Thus, the total incident photos number can be calculated to be 9.643 A 10 A7 mols A1 .
