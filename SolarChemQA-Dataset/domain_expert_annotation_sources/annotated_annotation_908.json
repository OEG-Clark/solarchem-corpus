"2.1.Materials.Anatase-type TiO 2 PC500 was provided by CrystalActiv and calcined in air at 400 C for 4 h to eliminate any remaining organic residue on its surface.Bimetallic catalysts were prepared in two consecutive steps.The deposition of silver was performed via a wet impregnation method using aqueous AgNO 3 (Sigma-Aldrich) solutions.First, appropriate amounts of precursor to obtain 0.5-3 wt of Ag in the final material were dissolved in 25 mL of Milli-Q water (Millipore).Then, the TiO 2 was added under magnetic stirring.Water was then eliminated at 60 C and 200 mbar in a rotatory evaporator, and the resulting powder was subsequently dried overnight in a furnace at 100 C.Finally, the powder was homogenized in a mortar, fired in air at 400 C for 4 h, and pulverized again.The deposition of gold nanoparticles was performed via a deposition-precipitation method using aqueous HAuCl 4 3H 2 O (Strem Chemicals) solutions.The precursor was first dissolved into 300 mL of Milli-Q water, targeting a final 0.5-3 wt Au.The Ag/TiO 2 powder was then added under stirring.Afterward, the suspension was heated at 70 C, and the pH was adjusted to 9 using a 0.1 M NaOH solution and stirred under these conditions overnight.After that, the catalyst was recovered by filtration and rinsed several times with Milli-Q water (Millipore).Then, the powder was dried at 100 C for 12 h, ground in an agate mortar, calcined in air at 200 C for 4 h, and ground again.The prepared samples were named as XAgXAu/TiO 2 , where X refers to the nominal amount (wt ) of silver and gold. 2.2.Characterization of the Prepared Materials.The crystal structure of the prepared samples were characterized by a X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Panalytical EMPYREAN equipment with Cu K radiation ( 1.54178A) at a scanning rate of 0.2s -1 .Mean crystallite sizes were estimated by applying the Scherrer formula to the most intense reflection of anatase.The deposited amount of gold was determined by means of inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) analysis on PerkinElmer Optima 3300 DV equipment after acid digestion of the samples.Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas were determined from nitrogen adsorption isotherms recorded on a Quadrasorb equipment (Quantachrome Instruments) after degassing the samples at 105 C for 20 h.The morphology of particles was studied using a FEG S/TEM system (Model Talos F200X, FEI) equipped with a chemical analysis system via energydispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS).Ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-Vis DRS) of powdered samples were recorded on PerkinElmer Lambda 1050 UV/vis/NIR equipment with a Praying Mantis diffuse reflectance accessory.Steady-state fluorescence spectra of the powdered samples were recorded in front-face mode on a PerkinElmer LS55 fluorescence spectrometer, using excitation wavelengths of 300 or 445 nm with cutoff filters at 250 or 515 nm, respectively.Fluorescence lifetimes were measured by time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) with Mini- equipment (Edinburgh Instruments).For UV measurements, a laser with a wavelength of 372.2 nm and a pulse width of 61.2 ps was used for excitation, and a band-pass filter at 400 25 nm was placed before the detector.For visible ones, the laser had a wavelength of 445.2nm and a pulse width of 90.7 ps, and emission was filtered at 600 25 nm.Experimental data were fitted to biexponential decay curves and the average fluorescence lifetime was calculated as (A i i 2 )/(A i i ), where A i is the amplitude and i is the lifetime of each contribution. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were recorded with a laboratory-based spectrometer (SPECS GmbH, Berlin) using monochromated Al K source (h 1486.6eV) operated at 25 W as excitation source.In the spectrometer, the X-ray is focused in a -FOCUS 600 monochromator onto a 300 m spot on the sample, and the data are recorded in PHOIBOS 150 NAP 1D-DLD analyzer in fixed analyzer transmission (FAT) mode.The pass energy was set to 40 eV for survey scans and 20 eV for high-resolution regions.The binding energy scale was calibrated using Au 4f 7/2 (84.01 eV) and Ag 3d 5/2 (368.20 eV).Recorded spectra were additionally calibrated against the C 1s internal reference.Data interpretation was done with CasaXPS.Shirley or two-point linear background were used, depending on the spectrum shape.Surface chemical analysis was done based on the peak area of high-resolution spectra and the CasaXPS sensitivity factors (where the RSF of C 1s is 1.000). Ti and Ag K-edge (4510 and 22162 eV) X-ray absorption (XAS) measurements were collected in fluorescence and transmission mode, respectively, at the CLAESS beamline of the ALBA synchrotron. 32The samples, ca. 10 mg, were loaded in a quartz capillary tube.The flow of reaction gases fed to the reactor was constant at 2 mL min -1 , with a CO 2 :H 2 O molar Industrial Engineering Chemistry Research ratio of 7:1 at room temperature.XANES spectra were collected during alternate exposures to external illumination using a high-power UV LED (365 nm) or a blue laser (445 nm).The gas was analyzed in-line at the exit of the reaction cell by means of a single-quadruple mass spectrometer from Pfeiffer Omnistar.XAS data were collected using a Si(111) crystal monochromator and a single-channel silicon drift detector in fluorescence mode and ionization chambers in transmission mode.The spectra of silver and titanium foils were recorded at the same time to ensure proper energy calibration.Data normalization was performed using the Athena package. 33.3.Photocatalytic Reactions.Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction experiments were performed in continuous mode in a stainless-steel photoreactor with a borosilicate glass top window for irradiation.Approximately 100 mg of photocatalyst powder was deposited on a glass fiber filter from an aqueous suspension, after which the filter was dried at 100 C for 3 h.The coated filter was then introduced in the reactor which, after tight closing and heating up to 50 C, was evacuated by a vacuum pump and flushed for 1 h with Ar gas to remove any substance weakly adsorbed on the surface of the photocatalyst or the support.After that, a CO 2 -H 2 O mixture with 7.25:1 volume ratio was passed for 1 h to ensure an adsorptiondesorption equilibrium, and then the reactor pressure was set to 2 bar and the gas flow to 2 mL min -1 .After 1 h in darkness under these conditions, irradation was started by means of four fluorescent lamps of 6 W, each with a maximum emission at 365 nm, for UV experiments, and of a 30 W white LED source (emission spectrum in Figure S1 in the Supporting Information) for visible ones.The reaction products were analyzed in line every 22 min by means of a gas chromatograph (Agilent 7890) equipped with three columns (MOLESIEVE 5A, CP-SIL 5B, and HP-PLOT Q), one thermal conductivity detector, and two flame ionization detectors.In the absence of UV or visible illumination, no products were detected.", "vote": "1"}, {"llm generation": "Bimetallic catalysts", "source": "Bimetallic catalysts were prepared

surface exposure of silver nanoparticles (NPs).The close contact between metal NPs and TiO 2 allows an efficient charge transfer between both phases upon excitation, which results in a distinct reaction mechanism under ultraviolet (UV) and visible illumination.Under UV light, bimetallic catalysts are able to shift the reaction selectivity toward methane, compared to the solely syngas (CO H 2 ) production over bare TiO 2 .This effect is ascribed to the capacity of the metal NPs to extract photoexcited electrons.Under visible light, this selectivity modification is not observed, whereas bimetallic catalysts are active toward syngas production, significantly improving the residual activity of TiO 2 .Under these conditions, an additional strong interfacial interaction between metal NPs and TiO 2 allows the photoexcitation of electrons from surface states in the band gap, leading to the occurrence of near-surface electron-hole pairs.", "vote": "1"}, {"llm generation": "UV", "source":

provided by CrystalActiv and calcined in air at 400 C for 4 h to eliminate any remaining organic residue on its surface.Bimetallic catalysts were prepared in two consecutive steps.The deposition of silver was performed via a wet impregnation method using aqueous AgNO 3 (Sigma-Aldrich) solutions.First, appropriate amounts of precursor to obtain 0.5-3 wt of Ag in the final material were dissolved in 25 mL of Milli-Q water (Millipore).Then, the TiO 2 was added under magnetic stirring.Water was then eliminated at 60 C and 200 mbar in a rotatory evaporator, and the resulting powder was subsequently dried overnight in a furnace at 100 C.Finally, the powder was homogenized in a mortar, fired in air at 400 C for 4 h, and pulverized again.The deposition of gold nanoparticles was performed via a deposition-precipitation method using aqueous HAuCl 4 3H 2 O (Strem Chemicals) solutions.The precursor was first dissolved into 300 mL of Milli-Q water, targeting a final 0.5-3 wt Au.The Ag/TiO 2 powder was then added under stirring.Afterward, the suspension was heated at 70 C, and the pH was adjusted to 9 using a 0.1 M NaOH solution and stirred under these conditions overnight.After that, the catalyst was recovered by filtration and rinsed several times with Milli-Q water (Millipore).Then, the powder was dried at 100 C for 12 h, ground in an agate mortar, calcined in air at 200 C for 4 h, and ground again.The prepared samples were named as XAgXAu/TiO 2 , where X refers to the nominal amount (wt ) of silver and gold. 2.2.Characterization of the Prepared Materials.The crystal structure of the prepared samples were characterized by a X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Panalytical EMPYREAN equipment with Cu K radiation ( 1.54178A) at a scanning rate of 0.2s -1 .Mean crystallite sizes were estimated by applying the Scherrer formula to the most intense reflection of anatase.The deposited amount of gold was determined by means of inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) analysis on PerkinElmer Optima 3300 DV equipment after acid digestion of the samples.Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas were determined from nitrogen adsorption isotherms recorded on a Quadrasorb equipment (Quantachrome Instruments) after degassing the samples at 105 C for 20 h.The morphology of particles was studied using a FEG S/TEM system (Model Talos F200X, FEI) equipped with a chemical analysis system via energydispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS).Ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-Vis DRS) of powdered samples were recorded on PerkinElmer Lambda 1050 UV/vis/NIR equipment with a Praying Mantis diffuse reflectance accessory.Steady-state fluorescence spectra of the powdered samples were recorded in front-face mode on a PerkinElmer LS55 fluorescence spectrometer, using excitation wavelengths of 300 or 445 nm with cutoff filters at 250 or 515 nm, respectively.Fluorescence lifetimes were measured by time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) with Mini- equipment (Edinburgh Instruments).For UV measurements, a laser with a wavelength of 372.2 nm and a pulse width of 61.2 ps was used for excitation, and a band-pass filter at 400 25 nm was placed before the detector.For visible ones, the laser had a wavelength of 445.2nm and a pulse width of 90.7 ps, and emission was filtered at 600 25 nm.Experimental data were fitted to biexponential decay curves and the average fluorescence lifetime was calculated as (A i i 2 )/(A i i ), where A i is the amplitude and i is the lifetime of each contribution. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were recorded with a laboratory-based spectrometer (SPECS GmbH, Berlin) using monochromated Al K source (h 1486.6eV) operated at 25 W as excitation source.In the spectrometer, the X-ray is focused in a -FOCUS 600 monochromator onto a 300 m spot on the sample, and the data are recorded in PHOIBOS 150 NAP 1D-DLD analyzer in fixed analyzer transmission (FAT) mode.The pass energy was set to 40 eV for survey scans and 20 eV for high-resolution regions.The binding energy scale was calibrated using Au 4f 7/2 (84.01 eV) and Ag 3d 5/2 (368.20 eV).Recorded spectra were additionally calibrated against the C 1s internal reference.Data interpretation was done with CasaXPS.Shirley or two-point linear background were used, depending on the spectrum shape.Surface chemical analysis was done based on the peak area of high-resolution spectra and the CasaXPS sensitivity factors (where the RSF of C 1s is 1.000). Ti and Ag K-edge (4510 and 22162 eV) X-ray absorption (XAS) measurements were collected in fluorescence and transmission mode, respectively, at the CLAESS beamline of the ALBA synchrotron. 32The samples, ca. 10 mg, were loaded in a quartz capillary tube.The flow of reaction gases fed to the reactor was constant at 2 mL min -1 , with a CO 2 :H 2 O molar Industrial Engineering Chemistry Research ratio of 7:1 at room temperature.XANES spectra were collected during alternate exposures to external illumination using a high-power UV LED (365 nm) or a blue laser (445 nm).The gas was analyzed in-line at the exit of the reaction cell by means of a single-quadruple mass spectrometer from Pfeiffer Omnistar.XAS data were collected using a Si(111) crystal monochromator and a single-channel silicon drift detector in fluorescence mode and ionization chambers in transmission mode.The spectra of silver and titanium foils were recorded at the same time to ensure proper energy calibration.Data normalization was performed using the Athena package. 33.3.Photocatalytic Reactions.Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction experiments were performed in continuous mode in a stainless-steel photoreactor with a borosilicate glass top window for irradiation.Approximately 100 mg of photocatalyst powder was deposited on a glass fiber filter from an aqueous suspension, after which the filter was dried at 100 C for 3 h.The coated filter was then introduced in the reactor which, after tight closing and heating up to 50 C, was evacuated by a vacuum pump and flushed for 1 h with Ar gas to remove any substance weakly adsorbed on the surface of the photocatalyst or the support.After that, a CO 2 -H 2 O mixture with 7.25:1 volume ratio was passed for 1 h to ensure an adsorptiondesorption equilibrium, and then the reactor pressure was set to 2 bar and the gas flow to 2 mL min -1 .After 1 h in darkness under these conditions, irradation was started by means of four fluorescent lamps of 6 W, each with a maximum emission at 365 nm, for UV experiments, and of a 30 W white LED source (emission spectrum in Figure S1 in the Supporting Information) for visible ones.The reaction products were analyzed in line every 22 min by means of a gas chromatograph (Agilent 7890) equipped with three columns (MOLESIEVE 5A, CP-SIL 5B, and HP-PLOT Q), one thermal conductivity detector, and two flame ionization detectors.In the absence of UV or visible illumination, no products were detected.", "vote": "1"}, {"llm generation": "visible", "source": "XANES spectra were collected during alternate

calibration.Data normalization was performed using the Athena package. 33.3.Photocatalytic Reactions.Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction experiments were performed in continuous mode in a stainless-steel photoreactor with a borosilicate glass top window for irradiation.Approximately 100 mg of photocatalyst powder was deposited on a glass fiber filter from an aqueous suspension, after which the filter was dried at 100 C for 3 h.The coated filter was then introduced in the reactor which, after tight closing and heating up to 50 C, was evacuated by a vacuum pump and flushed for 1 h with Ar gas to remove any substance weakly adsorbed on the surface of the photocatalyst or the support.After that, a CO 2 -H 2 O mixture with 7.25:1 volume ratio was passed for 1 h to ensure an adsorptiondesorption

stirring.Water was then eliminated at 60 C and 200 mbar in a rotatory evaporator, and the resulting powder was subsequently dried overnight in a furnace at 100 C.Finally, the powder was homogenized in a mortar, fired in air at 400 C for 4 h, and pulverized again.The deposition of gold nanoparticles was performed via a deposition-precipitation method using aqueous HAuCl 4 3H 2 O (Strem Chemicals) solutions.The precursor was first dissolved into 300 mL of Milli-Q water, targeting a final 0.5-3 wt Au.The Ag/TiO 2 powder was then added under stirring.Afterward, the suspension was heated at 70 C, and the pH was adjusted to 9 using a 0.1 M NaOH solution and stirred under these conditions overnight.After that, the catalyst was recovered by filtration and rinsed several times with Milli-Q water (Millipore).Then, the powder was dried at 100 C for 12 h, ground in an agate mortar, calcined in air at 200 C for 4 h, and ground again.The prepared samples were named as XAgXAu/TiO 2 , where X refers to the nominal amount (wt ) of silver and gold. 2.2.Characterization of the Prepared Materials.The crystal structure of the prepared samples were characterized by a X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Panalytical EMPYREAN equipment with Cu K radiation ( 1.54178A) at a scanning rate of 0.2s -1 .Mean crystallite sizes were estimated by applying the Scherrer formula to the most intense reflection of anatase.The deposited amount of gold was determined by means of inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) analysis on PerkinElmer Optima 3300 DV equipment after acid digestion of the samples.Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas were determined from nitrogen adsorption isotherms recorded on a Quadrasorb equipment (Quantachrome Instruments) after degassing the samples at 105 C for 20 h.The morphology of particles was studied using a FEG S/TEM system (Model Talos F200X, FEI) equipped with a chemical analysis system via energydispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS).Ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-Vis DRS) of powdered samples were recorded on PerkinElmer Lambda 1050 UV/vis/NIR equipment with a Praying Mantis diffuse reflectance accessory.Steady-state fluorescence spectra of the powdered samples were recorded in front-face mode on a PerkinElmer LS55 fluorescence spectrometer, using excitation wavelengths of 300 or 445 nm with cutoff filters at 250 or 515 nm, respectively.Fluorescence lifetimes were measured by time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) with Mini- equipment (Edinburgh Instruments).For UV measurements, a laser with a wavelength of 372.2 nm and a pulse width of 61.2 ps was used for excitation, and a band-pass filter at 400 25 nm was placed before the detector.For visible ones, the laser had a wavelength of 445.2nm and a pulse width of 90.7 ps, and emission was filtered at 600 25 nm.Experimental data were fitted to biexponential decay curves and the average fluorescence lifetime was calculated as (A i i 2 )/(A i i ), where A i is the amplitude and i is the lifetime of each contribution. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were recorded with a laboratory-based spectrometer (SPECS GmbH, Berlin) using monochromated Al K source (h 1486.6eV) operated at 25 W as excitation source.In the spectrometer, the X-ray is focused in a -FOCUS 600 monochromator onto a 300 m spot on the sample, and the data are recorded in PHOIBOS 150 NAP 1D-DLD analyzer in fixed analyzer transmission (FAT) mode.The pass energy was set to 40 eV for survey scans and 20 eV for high-resolution regions.The binding energy scale was calibrated using Au 4f 7/2 (84.01 eV) and Ag 3d 5/2 (368.20 eV).Recorded spectra were additionally calibrated against the C 1s internal reference.Data interpretation was done with CasaXPS.Shirley or two-point linear background were used, depending on the spectrum shape.Surface chemical analysis was done based on the peak area of high-resolution spectra and the CasaXPS sensitivity factors (where the RSF of C 1s is 1.000). Ti and Ag K-edge (4510 and 22162 eV) X-ray absorption (XAS) measurements were collected in fluorescence and transmission mode, respectively, at the CLAESS beamline of the ALBA synchrotron. 32The samples, ca. 10 mg, were loaded in a quartz capillary tube.The flow of reaction gases fed to the reactor was constant at 2 mL min -1 , with a CO 2 :H 2 O molar Industrial Engineering Chemistry Research ratio of 7:1 at room temperature.XANES spectra were collected during alternate exposures to external illumination using a high-power UV LED (365 nm) or a blue laser (445 nm).The gas was analyzed in-line at the exit of the reaction cell by means of a single-quadruple mass spectrometer from Pfeiffer Omnistar.XAS data were collected using a Si(111) crystal monochromator and a single-channel silicon drift detector in fluorescence mode and ionization chambers in transmission mode.The spectra of silver and titanium foils were recorded at the same time to ensure proper energy calibration.Data normalization was performed using the Athena package. 33.3.Photocatalytic Reactions.Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction experiments were performed in continuous mode in a stainless-steel photoreactor with a borosilicate glass top window for irradiation.Approximately 100 mg of photocatalyst powder was deposited on a glass fiber filter from an aqueous suspension, after which the filter was dried at 100 C for 3 h.The coated filter was then introduced in the reactor which, after tight closing and heating up to 50 C, was evacuated by a vacuum pump and flushed for 1 h with Ar gas to remove any substance weakly adsorbed on the surface of the photocatalyst or the support.After that, a CO 2 -H 2 O mixture with 7.25:1 volume ratio was passed for 1 h to ensure an adsorptiondesorption equilibrium, and then the reactor pressure was set to 2 bar and the gas flow to 2 mL min -1 .After 1 h in darkness under these conditions, irradation was started by means of four fluorescent lamps of 6 W, each with a maximum emission at 365 nm, for UV experiments, and of a 30 W white LED source (emission spectrum in Figure S1 in the Supporting Information) for visible ones.The reaction products were analyzed in line every 22 min by means of a gas chromatograph (Agilent 7890) equipped with three columns (MOLESIEVE 5A, CP-SIL 5B, and HP-PLOT Q), one thermal conductivity detector, and two flame
