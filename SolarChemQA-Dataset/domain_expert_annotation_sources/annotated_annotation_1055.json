Furthermore, CuNi, CuPb, CuPt, CuAu and CuRu samples were also prepared by the above preparation steps except that the corresponding metal ion can substitute Co ion. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were recorded on a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer with Cu-K radiation ( 1.5406A).Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were recorded on a Bruker Tensor spectrometer.X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was recorded on Thermo ESCALAB250 instrument with a monochromatized Al K line source (200 W).Microstructure was investigated by a transmission electron microscope (TEM) (JEM-2100F) and a scanning electron microscope (SEM) (FESEM, Hitachi, S-4800).Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface area was tested at 77.4 K using a surface area analyzer (ASAP 2020, American) based on nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms.Prior to the experiments, the samples were dried and degassed under vacuum at 200 C for 12 h.Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were recorded on a Bruker Tensor 27 spectrometer.In order to verify the behavior of the samples in the existence of CO 2 , the samples were analysed by temperature programmed CO desorption (TPD-CO 2 ).The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS, Hitachi U-3010 spectrophotometer) were recorded by the Kubelka-Munk approach with BaSO 4 as a reference.Transient PL lifetime and photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded on a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Edinburgh Instruments, FLSP-920).CO and CH 4 labelled by 13 C was detected with gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (Agilent 6890 N/5975, USA). The photocatalytic CO 2 production test was conducted in a Pyrex reactor with excellent air tightness.As a representative photocatalytic CO 2 reduction experiment, 10 mg sample was added with a magnetic stirrer in a 100 mL Pyrex reactor (4 mL H 2 O, 2 mL lactic acid).The reactor was completely evacuated, and then washed with CO 2 several times.Initially, the reactor was purged with CO 2 for 30 min and then sealed at 1 atm CO 2 .The reaction mixture was continuously stirred with a magnetic and irradiated under a 300 W Xe lamp (light intensity was 150 mW/cm 2 ).Meanwhile, the cooling water was used to maintain the room temperature.After the reaction, the CO and CH 4 were analyzed by a gas chromatograph of GC7900 (Tian Mei, Shanghai) with a FID detector and the H 2 was also detected by GC7900 with a TCD detector. Electrochemical measurements were conducted with a CHI660E electrochemical workstation in a conventional three electrode cell, using an Ag/AgCl electrode (3 M KCl) as the reference electrode and a Pt wire as the counter electrode.The working electrode was prepared on ITO conductive glass.The 50 mg sample was dispersed in 2 mL ethanol by sonication to produce a slurry.The slurry was spread onto ITO conductive glass using the doctor blade technique and dried at 80 C for 12 h.The working electrodes were irradiated by a 300 W Xe lamp (PLS-SXE300, Trusttech) in 0.1 M Na 2 SO 4 solution.Scheme 1.
