The photocatalytic CO2 conversion experiment was conducted with the synthesized PBNO/CP/GF to verify CH4 and CO production rate and selectivity of CO2 conversion.The overall reaction mechanisms of CO2 conversion to form CH4 and CO by the photocatalytic activity is given below 1,2. In the beginning step, the production rate of CO was faster than that of CH4.The reason is that 2 mol of protons and electrons are required to produce 1 mol of CO, whereas production of 1 mol of CH4 needs 8 mol of protons and electrons.Thus, the lack of protons and electrons in the early stage derives faster formation of CO rather than CH4 1.However, after generated abundant amounts of protons and electrons by photocatalytic activity, the produced amount of CH4 and CO was reversed because the generation of CH4 is thermodynamically easier than that of CO as expressed in equation ( 3) and ( 4) 1.In this study, the polyaniline coated onto the PBNO surface much enhanced CO2 conversion efficiency because it can behave as an electron conductor under the visible light irradiation 8.As shown in Fig. 4, the PBNO/10CP/GF exhibited the highest CO2 conversion efficiency and the production rates of CH4 and CO were 72.76 and 54.36 (mol g -1 cat.h -1 ), respectively, after 360 min of visible light irradiation.The CO2 conversion efficiency was gradually decreased with increase of polyaniline ratio above 10.The reason is that excessive amount of polyaniline can cause agglomeration of PBNO particles and reduce the available PBNO surface harvesting light source for photocatalytic activity.
