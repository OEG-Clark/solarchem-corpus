The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was performed in an on-line CO 2 reduction system (Beijing Perfect Light Technology Co., Ltd.).Typically, 15 mg of the photocatalyst was added into the reaction flask, degassed and purged with CO 2 .A mixture of MeCN and TEOA (110 mL in total) with a volume ratio of 10 to 1 was degassed by CO 2 to remove the dissolved O 2 , and then injected into the reaction flask.The reaction proceeded under the irradiation of a Xe lamp (300 W) with a UV-cut filter and an IR-cut filter (800 nm 420 nm) at room temperature for 10 h.The formed HCOOH was detected by an ion chromatography (930 Compact IC pro, Metrohm) with a Metrosep A supp 5 250/4.0column.A mixture of 3.2 mM Na 2 CO 3 and 1.0 mM NaHCO 3 was used as eluent.The gaseous reaction products were also analyzed using a GC (Agilent 6890A) with a HP-5 capillary column for a flame ionization detector (FID) and a 5A molecular sieve packed column for a thermal conductivity detector (TCD).For the reusability test, after the reaction, the photocatalyst was separated from the reaction medium, repeatedly washed with deionized water twice, and then dried overnight in a vacuum oven at 120 C before the next run.", "vote": "1"}]}}
