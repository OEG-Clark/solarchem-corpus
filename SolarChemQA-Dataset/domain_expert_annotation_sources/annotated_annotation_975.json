TiO 2 and Bi-doped TiO 2 (Bi-T) were prepared by alcohol-based sol gel method.10 ml of TiP was first added to 30 ml of isopropanol and the resulting solution (solution A) was kept under vigorous stirring for 30 min.The second solution (solution B) was prepared by mixing 7 ml aqueous solution of diluted acetic acid (1 M) with 10 ml isopropanol and stirred for 30 min.Solution B was then added dropwise to solution A in order to hydrolyze the TiP with the resulting white sol continuously stirred overnight.An appropriate amount of Bi(NO 3 ) 3 5H 2 O was dissolved in 10 ml of isopropanol followed by 30 min of stirring to prepare solution C which was added dropwise to the white sol in order to form the final solution that was subsequently stirred for one day followed by 12 h of drying at 80 C and 2 h of calcination at 500 C. The resulting powder was called yBi-T (y 1, 3 and 5) where T and y indicate TiO 2 and wt of Bi, respectively. The Pt-modified samples were synthesized by the photo-deposition method presented by Ma et al. (2018) and were designated as xPt-T (x 1, 1.5 and 2) where T and x indicate TiO 2 and wt of Pt, respectively.Typically, 0.5 g of TiO 2 was suspended into 200 ml of 20 vol aqueous solution of methanol in a sealed glass cell followed by adding the appropriate amount of H 2 PtCl 6 solution (4 g/l).Inert N 2 gas was then purged into the cell for 1 h to eliminate dissolved oxygen before illumination.After 4 h of UV light irradiation by 250 W Hg lamp, the browncolored solids were collected by centrifuging at 3000 rpm for 10 min.The precipitate was then rinsed several times with distilled water to remove surface adsorbed ions and then dried at 90 C for 12 h.The xPt-T and yBi-T samples were used in CO 2 photo-reduction experiments to determine the optimum amounts of Bi and Pt that were subsequently used to synthesize the bi-modified-TiO 2 . The crystalline phase and structure of the catalyst samples were identified by XRD patterns obtained from a PANalytical XPert Pro MPD diffractometer with an accelerating voltage of 40 kV at 2 scan range of 10-80 with a resolution of 0.026 .Morphological aspects of the nanostructures were observed by taking field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images using a Mira III Tescan microscope and, simultaneously, EDXS and corresponding elemental mapping were performed to evaluate the composition and dispersion of different elements in the samples.Electron microscopy micrographs of the photocatalysts were obtained by TEM using a ZEISS EM900 microscope.Porosity and specific surface area of the samples were analyzed by BET isotherm using N 2 adsorption-desorption data obtained from a Belsorpmini II apparatus.The optical absorption of the catalysts was measured by recording their reflectance using a Avaspec-2048-TEC spectrometer in the range of 300-900 nm.The reflectance data were then converted to absorbance by the Kubelka-Munk analysis.Photoluminescence emission spectra of the samples were obtained by Agilent g9800a apparatus with excitation wavelength of 325 nm.Raman spectrum of catalysts were collected using TakRam N1-541 spectrometer with 532 nm laser.Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy was performed using Bruker EMS-104 spectrometer with X-band (9.8 GHz) microwave irradiation. Photo-reduction experiments were conducted in a batch gas-solid mode photo-reactor that consisted of a glass-made cylindrical container with a quartz window on top to efficiently allow UV light transmission from the lamp to the bottom of the reactor where the powdered catalyst was placed.The reactor was equipped with Hg lamp 365 nm, (125, 250 and 400 W) as the light source and had four ports: one for inlet, one for outlet, one for sampling, and one for the temperature sensor.Prior to each experiment, 0.2 g of photocatalyst was dispersed in 20 ml isopropanol that was poured into the reactor and heated to 80 C for 2 h to form a thin photocatalyst layer.Pure CO 2 was then introduced to reactor in order to purge out the air.CO 2 flowrate was then adjusted to the desired value and introduced to a water bubbler to saturate the feed gas with water vapor prior to entering the reactor.After 30 min of feed flow into the reactor, inlet and outlet ports were sealed and the lamp was turned on to start the reaction.The products were collected in a gas bag after the completion of the reaction and injected into a GC, Agilent model 7890A equipped with an HP-5 capillary column, a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a flame ionization (FID) detector, to determine the product concentrations.CH 4 yield was calculated according to the Eq.
