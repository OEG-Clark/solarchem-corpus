Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction tests were conducted using nsGa 2 O 3 with Ag loading as a co-catalyst.Commercially available -Ga 2 O 3 (Kojundo Chemical Laboratory Co., Ltd., Purity 99.99, denoted as -Ga 2 O 3 ) was also tested for the comparison.The 0.5 wt Ag co-catalyst was loaded by a photodeposition method with using AgNO 3 (Kishida Chemical Co., Ltd., Purity 99.8) as a precursor.However, the loaded Ag co-catalyst on nsGa 2 O 3 was unstable in water under UV light irradiation to be oxidized or reduced to large metallic particles, resulting in the loss of catalytic activity.Recently we have succeeded to control and stabilize the size and distribution of Ag nanoparticles (Ag NPs) on Ga 2 O photocatalysts with using aqueous solution of methanol 17.Therefore, the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction tests were conducted using the aqueous solution of methanol with the optimized concentration of vol, which made Ag-NPs stable during the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction tests and gave reproducible results to compare the photocatalytic activities of synthesized nsGa 2 O 3 with that of -Ga 2 O 3 . Three samples thus prepared were subjected to photocatalytic CO reduction tests; two samples consisting of the phase (nsGa 2 O 3 (1023 K) and ns Ga 2 O 3 (1123 K)), and -Ga 2 O 3 with Ag loaded as a co-catalyst.The loaded amounts were determined as 0.24, 0.39 and 0.33 wt, respectively from X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy measurement .Three samples are referred to as Ag/nsGa 2 O 3 (1023 K), Ag/nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) and Ag/-Ga 2 O 3 ) hereafter. The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction tests were carried out in a fixedbed flow reactor cell.50 mg of the sample was dispersed in the aqueous solution of 10 mL of NaHCO 3 (1 M) and 2 mL of methanol.The air in the cell was replaced with CO 2 gas with the flow rate of 50 mL/min for 30 min.Then, the tests were conducted with UV irradiation under the CO 2 gas with the flow rate of 3.0 mL/min.A 300 W Xe lamp was used as the UV source and its light intensity was about 25 mW/cm 2 in the wavelength range of 254 10 nm.The reaction products (mainly CO and H 2 ) were analyzed by a gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector.Without the CO 2 flow in the reaction cell, the amount of produced CO was very small.This confirms that methanol hardly influenced the CO 2 reduction in the present experiments as already found in previous works 17,18. For understanding of the formation process of nsGa 2 O 3 , thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted with a Thermo plus EVO2 (Rigaku) using a Pt pan sample holder in air, with a heating rate of 5 K/ min.Characterization of samples was performed by a transmission electron microscope (TEM), a scanning electron microscope (SEM), Xray diffraction (XRD), X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) and UV-Vis diffuse reflectance (UV-Vis DR).Specific surface area (SSA) was also measured. TEM images of the samples were acquired with JEM-2100F, operating at 200 kV.SEM images of the samples were acquired with JSM-6500F, operating at 15 kV.XRD patterns of the samples were recorded on a MiniFlex600 (Rigaku) using Cu K as a radiation source with an operating voltage of 40 kV and current of 15 mA.The XRD patterns were collected at 2 angles of 10-80 .The 2 step size was 0.02 , and the scanning rate was 5 /min.Ga K-edge XAFS spectra of nsGa 2 O 3 were measured at the beamline 5S1 in Aichi Synchrotron Radiation Center using a Si(1 1 1) double-crystal monochromator at RT.The data were recorded in a transmission mode.Ga L 3 -edge XAFS spectra were recorded in a fluorescence yield mode at beamline 2A in UVSOR, Institute for Molecular Science, using beryl double-crystal monochromator at RT. SSA of the samples were determined by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) SSA measurements at 77 K (liquid N 2 temperature) using Monosorb (Quantachrome).Before the BET measurements, the samples were heated at 573 K for 3 h in N 2 atmosphere as a pretreatment.The adsorbed amounts of CO 2 on nsGa 2 O 3 samples and their chemical states were investigated by in-situ FT-IR measurements using FT/IR-6100 (JASCO) in the transmission mode at RT.The sample (ca.15 mg) was pressed into a disk (diameter: 10 mm) at 50 MPa and placed in an in-situ IR cell equipped with CaF 2 window.The cell allowed us in-situ measurements as well as sample heating, introduction of the reactant gas and UV light irradiation.Before the in-situ measurement, the sample was pretreated with evacuation at RT for 3 h.UV-Vis DR spectra were measured at RT using a spectrometer (JASCO V-670).The spectrum of Ba 2 SO 4 was used as the reference.The concentration of loaded Ag on Ga 2 O 3 was determined by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) measurement using with EDX-720 (Shimadzu) whose primary X-ray source is Rh. As mentioned in the experimental section, GO was partly reduced and GaO x /rGO was produced during the heat treatment at 453 K in the autoclave.The following calcination of GaO x /rGO at higher temperature resulted in the planar aggregates of nsGa 2 O 3 by removing rGO and full oxidation of GaO x .In order to understand the above process, TGA was done both for GO and GaO x /rGO in the temperatures ranging from to 900 K.The results were given in Fig. 2. The weight losses of GO appeared at around 320 K and 500 K were caused by water desorption and oxidative evaporation of functional groups such as -OH and -COOH in GO, respectively 21.The full combustion of carbon started at around 800 K and completed at 900 K.In the TGA profile of GaO x / rGO, the gradual loss continued until the final full combustion.Since no clear loss corresponding to the evaporation of the functional groups was observed, GO must be mildly reduced during the autoclave treatment.That is the reason for using the terminology of rGO.Even if there was the evaporation of the functional groups, the weight gain caused by the oxidation of GaOx could hinder the evaporation loss.After the full combustion at around 900 K only Ga 2 O 3 remained.From the weight of the remained Ga 2 O 3 , we have determined the loading amount of Ga 2 O in the GaO x /rGO to be 25 wt which included some uncertainty caused by the full oxidation of GaOx to Ga 2 O 3 . Fig. 3 shows SEM images of GaO x /rGO, and Fig. 4 shows TEM images of GO and GaO x /rGO.The SEM images clearly show that GaO x /rGO is consisting of petal-like sheets with their width of around a few m.Each sheet of GaO x /rGO is transparent in the TEM image.The sheet seems homogenous and a little thicker than GO sheet except some segregation of GaO x which is appreciable as local black colored areas.The existence of GaO x on rGO was confirmed by the appearance of amorphous like patterns in XRD (See Fig. 7(a)).In EXAFS analysis, the existence of GaO x was also confirmed, and the bonding or coordination of a gallium atom to the first and second neighboring ones were depicted as described below. In Fig. 1 is indicated how nsGa 2 O 3 synthesis proceeded according to the obtained results.(Fig. 5(a,b)), respectively.As for RSFs, the first peak around 1-2 A was assigned to the backscattering from adjacent atoms to a gallium atom, corresponding to Ga-O bond for both -Ga 2 O 3 and GaO x /rGO.Although the second peak around 2.5-3 A appeared in the RSF of GaO x /rGO (Fig. 5(c)) seems well corresponding to the second-neighboring Ga atoms (Ga-(O)-Ga) appeared in the RSF of -Ga 2 O 3 (Fig. 5(d)) 222324, the curve-fitting analysis of GaO x /rGO suggests that the second peak is caused by Ga-O and Ga-C bonds having longer interatomic distances than first neighboring Ga-O bond.The appearance of these longer Ga-O and Ga-C bonds is likely caused by the junction between GaO x species and rGO in atomic scales.The absence of Ga-(O)-Ga bond also suggests GaO x species on rGO were highly dispersed rather than aggregated. Fig. 6 compares TEM images of nsGa 2 O 3 (823-1123 K) and -Ga 2 O 3 .The images clearly indicate the difference in the morphology among synthesized nsGa 2 O 3 and -Ga 2 O 3 .It should be noted that two dimensional structure of the GaO x /rGO was maintained after the removal of the rGO.Thus, sheet-like materials consisting of nano-sized polycrystalline were successfully synthesized by the present method.Although the average size of polycrystalline became larger with increasing the calcination temperature, planar aggregate structures made of nano-particulates were maintained even for nsGa 2 O 3 calcined at such high temperature as 1123 K (sample nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K)). Table 1 shows the results of BET SSA measurements for nsGa 2 O 3 (823-1123 K) and -Ga 2 O 3 .It should be noted that SSA of nsGa 2 O 3 (823-1123 K) are larger than that of -Ga 2 O 3 about 18, 11, 9.8 and 6.5 times, respectively. In Fig. 7, XRD patterns of GaO x /rGO, nsGa 2 O 3 (823-1123 K) and -Ga 2 O 3 were compared.The XRD pattern of GaO x /rGO spreads widely with low intensity, including a broad peak assigned to (0 0 2) plane of graphite (Fig. 7(a)) 25.This indicates that very thin amorphous like GaO x or highly dispersed small GaO x particles were loaded on rGO.As the calcination temperature increased, the crystallinity of nsGa 2 O samples was improved.The higher the crystallinity of nsGa 2 O 3 became, the smaller SSA was.The XRD patterns of nsGa 2 O 3 (823, 923 K) were consisting of the mixed diffraction patterns of -Ga 2 O 3 and -Ga 2 O 3 , while those of nsGa 2 O 3 (1023, 1123 K) were assigned to the single phase of -Ga 2 O 3 .Thus, after removing rGO from GaO x /rGO by calcination, GaO x turned to be aggregation of nano-sized particles, which maintained the sheet like form and consisted of mixed phases of and by calcination at 823-923 K.The calcination above 1023 K made all particles to the single phase of -Ga 2 O 3 . The crystallite size was calculated from the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the most intense diffraction peak using the Scherrer's equation as shown in Table 1.Since the crystallite sizes derived from the Scherrer's equation was consistent with that observed in the TEM images in Fig. 6(b),(d),(f) and (h), it can be concluded that nsGa 2 O 3 were formed by crystallization of amorphous like Ga 2 O 3 sheet and aggregation of the crystallized nano-particles with keeping the sheet like form.Fig. 8 compares Ga L 3 -edge XANES spectra of single phases of , and in (a) with those of nsGa 2 O 3 in (b).It is known that Ga L 3 -edge XAFS analysis gives more detailed information on the local symmetry structures of nsGa 2 O 3 compared with Ga K-edge XAFS analysis 14,26.As seen in Fig. 8 (a), the intensities of the peak around 1107 eV decreases in the order of -Ga 2 O 3 , -Ga 2 O 3 and -Ga 2 O 3 .The main difference among these three phases is number density of hexacoordinated Ga atoms structure; the highest one is -Ga 2 O 3 in which all Ga atoms are hexacoordinated, the second, -Ga 2 O 3 including some tetracoordinated Ga atoms, and the least, -Ga 2 O 3 consisting of hexacoordinated Ga and tetracoordinated Ga atoms evenly. As shown in Fig. 8(b), the peak intensity around 1107 eV of the Ga L 3 -edge XANES spectra of nsGa 2 O 3 decreased with increasing the calcination temperature.This indicates that nsGa 2 O 3 calcined at lower temperature were mainly composed of hexacoordinated Ga atoms, while the calcination of nsGa 2 O 3 at higher temperature increases tetracoordinated Ga atmos.This is consistent with the results of XRD measurement. Although Ga K-edge EXAFS spectra of nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) and -Ga 2 O were similar with each other (Fig. 9(a)), derived RSFs from them showed the important difference; the second peak at around 2.7 A attributed to Ga-(O)-Ga bond was lower for nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) than that of -Ga 2 O 3 (See Fig. 9(b)).Using the curve fitting, the coordination number for Ga-(O)-Ga bond was evaluated and given in Table 2.The coordination number in nsGa 2 O 3 is a little smaller than that in -Ga 2 O 3 .Considering that EXAFS provides sub-nm or nm sized local structure, the difference in the coordination number suggests that nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) consisting of -Ga 2 O 3 crystalline structure is a little defective compared to fully crystalized one, owing to its very thin planer structure consisting of nano-particulates. Fig. 10 compares the production rates of H 2 and CO and the selectivity toward CO evolution observed for three tested samples in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction using aqueous solution with methanol.H 2 and CO were continuously evolved throughout the reaction tests for both samples.CO production rate of Ag/nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) was over 2 times higher than that of Ag/-Ga 2 O 3 , while H 2 production rate was lower.Consequently, CO selectivity (the ratio of CO production amount to total amounts of reduction products) of Ag/nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) reached 70.nsGa 2 O 3 (1023 K) showed a little less activity than that for nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K), probably because its crystallinity was less than that of the latter.Hence the discussion was focused to comparison of Ag/ nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) and Ag/-Ga 2 O 3. Since CO could be evolved from methanol or NaHCO 3, the reduction test without CO 2 flow was conducted.As shown in Fig. 11, the CO production rate without CO 2 flow was only 1.5-3.4mol/h.Furthermore, no CO production was observed without Ag/nsGa 2 O 3 .Therefore, it is confirmed that most of the generated CO was derived from the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction and nsGa 2 O 3 prepared by the present method was suitable for CO 2 reduction rather than H 2 production from water compared to -Ga 2 O 3 used here. It was found that nsGa 2 O 3 (sheet-like nanometer-sized particulate Ga 2 O 3 ) exhibiting well crystallized -phase gave better performance in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction than that given by -Ga 2 O 3 .The improvement is, in some sense, a corollary of ultrafine particulation, as appeared in the increase of SSA.Still nsGa 2 O 3 exhibits different characters relating photocatalytic activity compared with those of -Ga 2 O 3 .They are CO 2 absorption capability and states of Ag cocatalyst on them. To reveal the adsorbed species on nsGa 2 O 3 and -Ga 2 O 3 as prepared, in-situ FT-IR measurements were conducted.Fig. 12 shows FT-IR spectra in wavelength range 2600-3800 cm -1 , which represent adsorbed water or hydroxyl groups on nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) and -Ga 2 O 3 .The larger peak intensity for nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) than -Ga 2 O 3 well corresponds to the larger SSA of the former.Since nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) exhibiting -Ga 2 O phase was a little defective compared to fully crystalized one, included defects in nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) likely contribute to provide adsorption sites for hydroxyl groups.To make detailed comparison on adsorbed hydroxyl groups on both samples, the two FT-IR spectra are compared by normalizing with their peak intensity at 3463 cm -1 as the inset of Fig. 12.Two peaks at 3720 and 3653 cm -1 are appreciable, which are assigned to the stretching vibration of single and bridge bonded hydroxyl groups, respectively 27.The larger intensity of these peaks for nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) than -Ga 2 O 3 indicates that the former adsorbed more hydroxyl groups compared to the latter.Fig. 13 shows the difference FT-IR spectra of the adsorbed species on nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) and -Ga 2 O 3 after introduction of 45 Torr of CO 2 .The absorption bands at 1635 and 1420 cm -1 are assigned to asymmetric CO 3 stretching vibration as (CO 3 ) and symmetric CO 3 stretching vibration s (CO 3 ) of monodentate bicarbonate species, respectively 28293031, while the bands at 1590 and 1320 cm -1 are attributed to as (CO 3 ) and s (CO 3 ) of bidentate carbonate species, respectively 282930.CO 2 molecules would react with the surface hydroxyl groups and the surface lattice oxygen of Ga 2 O 3 to form the monodentate bicarbonate species and bidentate carbonate species 32,33.The former is assigned to be an intermediated state for CO production over Ga 2 O 34.The significant increases of monodentate bicarbonate species on nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) compared to those on -Ga 2 O 3 could be one of the causes for the higher CO production on nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K). Fig. 14 shows UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra of nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) and -Ga 2 O 3 with comparison of Ag/nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) and Ag/-Ga 2 O after use for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction test.Before the Ag loading, the absorption derived from the bandgap transition of Ga 2 O appeared at 290 nm in both samples (Fig. 14a).As for Ag/ nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) and Ag/-Ga 2 O 3 after use (Fig. 14b), an absorption peak around 430 nm attributed to localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of small Ag nanoparticle (Ag NPs) was observed 33.It should be mentioned that without methanol addition, Ag-NPs on nsGa 2 O 3 were not stable and the absorption peak around 430 nm were broadened and/ or decreased, accompanying the activity loss.Recently, we have found the nearly linear relationship of the LSPR intensity (i.e., the number density of small Ag NPs) and the CO production rate and concluded that Ag NPs showing the LSPR absorption peak are active sites for the CO reduction 17.Since the LSPR peaks were sharp and more intense in The size distributions are given in Fig. 16.Thus ultrafine particulation of Ga 2 O 3 seems to stabilize AgNPs to be ca.20 nm or less, the suitable size as Ag cocatalyst by avoiding their aggregation. We have succeeded in synthesizing sheet-like Ga 2 O 3 (nsGa 2 O 3 ) with using GO as a template by loading Ga 2 O 3 precursor on GO followed by GO removal by calcination at higher temperatures.The synthesized nsGa 2 O 3 consists of the planner aggregation of the nanometer-sized Ga 2 O 3 particles which are much smaller than those of Ga 2 O 3 synthesized by a simple calcination such as commercially available -Ga 2 O 3 and other synthesized Ga 2 O 3 samples in our previous work 5.Accordingly, the specific surface area (SSA) of nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) was much larger than that of -Ga 2 O 3 .The crystallinity and crystalline phase of nsGa 2 O 3 were changed with the calcination temperature.Among all synthesized nsGa 2 O 3 samples, nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) which was consisted of the only -phase showed the highest CO production rate and CO selectivity in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with water including NaHCO 3 and methanol. Thus, we can conclude that nsGa 2 O 3 (sheet-like nanometer-sized particulate Ga 2 O 3 ) exhibiting well crystalized -phase gives better performance in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.At the present stage, it is difficult to mention the particular cause for the improvement.Observed changes in characters relating the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction are the increase of SSA, larger CO 2 adsorption ability and the loading state of Ag co-catalyst.Those are in some sense a corollary of ultrafine particulation.Still the crystalline phase and crystallite size of nsGa 2 O 3 were not fully controlled, it remains as a future work to optimize them for further improvement of the activity of nsGa 2 O 3 for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.

This work was supported continuously by Prof. Takenaka, Mr. Sugiyama and Mr. Suzuki of Doshisya University in the preparation of Ga 2 O 3 nano-sheets.Synchrotron experiments were carried out at Aichi Synchrotron Radiation Center and UVSOR Institute for Molecular Science which are supported by No. 2503042 and 2019-510, respectively.This work was supported by Kansai Research Foundation for Technology Promotion.", "vote": "1"}], "co-catalyst": [{"llm generation": "Ag", "source": "Furthermore, Ag loaded nsGa 2 O 3 calcined at 1123 K (Ag/nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K)) showed very high photocatalytic activity for CO production in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction test in water including methanol under UV light irradiation.", "context": "Since the activity of semiconductor photocatalysts for CO 2 reduction with water is still low, it is necessary to improve their activity.To do this, the optimization of particle size and crystal structure of the photocatalysts is one of the promising ways.In previous studies, we have reported that micro-particulate Ga 2 O 3 deposited on Al 2 O 3 support significantly improves the photocatalytic activity of CO 2 reduction.However, it is quite difficult to synthesize nano-particulate Ga 2 O 3 with high crystallinity by calcination at higher temperatures.In this work, we have tried to synthesize sheet-like nano-particulate Ga 2 O 3 using graphene oxide (GO) as a template for the first time.After loading gallium butoxide on GO, it was calcined to oxidize the gallium butoxide into Ga 2 O 3 and also to remove GO.Various spectroscopic analyses revealed that the synthesized materials were planar aggregation of nanometer-sized Ga 2 O 3 particles (nsGa 2 O 3 ), of which sizes and crystallinity could be controlled with the calcination temperature.The nsGa 2 O 3 calcined at 1123 K was well crystallized and showed -phase with a quite large specific surface area.Furthermore, Ag loaded nsGa 2 O 3 calcined at 1123 K (Ag/nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K)) showed very high photocatalytic activity for CO production in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction test in water including methanol under UV light irradiation.Thus, it is confirmed that the planar aggregation of nanometer-sized Ga 2 O 3 significantly improves the photocatalytic activity of Ga 2 O 3 on the CO 2 reduction.", "vote": "1"}, {"llm generation": "Ag", "source": "Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction tests were conducted using nsGa 2 O 3 with Ag loading as a co-catalyst.", "context": "Fig. 1 schematically shows synthesis processes, in which the results of characterizations given in the following sections were included.500 mg of dried GO which was obtained by the exfoliation of the graphitic oxide 19,20 following the Hummer's method 21 and 1.53 g of Ga (OnC 4 H 9 ) 3 (referred to as Ga(OBu) 3 ) were suspended in 500 mL of cyclohexane (super dehydrated, Wako Pure Chemicals).The suspension was stirred at room temperature (RT) for several days in order to disperse dried GO in cyclohexane homogeneously and to load Ga(OBu) 3 on the dried GO.Above processes were carried out in a nitrogen purged glove box because Ga(OBu) 3 is highly deliquescent.The obtained material is denoted as Ga(OBu) 3 /GO.Ga(OBu) 3 /GO was dispersed in 540 mL of cyclohexane and transferred to Teflon containers in a stainlesssteel autoclave.Then the autoclave was heated at 453 K for 6 h.During the heating, Ga(OBu) 3 was mostly oxidized to be GaO x and GO was partly reduced and referred to as rGO.Then, the resultant material was centrifuged and dried in a vacuum overnight to get GaO x /rGO.Finally, GaO x /rGO was calcined in air at a temperature ranging from 823 to 1123 K for 2 h (temperature raising rate: 2 C/min) to get sheet-like nsGa 2 O 3 (denoted as nsGa 2 O 3 (X K), where X indicates the calcination temperature). Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction tests were conducted using nsGa 2 O 3 with Ag loading as a co-catalyst.Commercially available -Ga 2 O 3 (Kojundo Chemical Laboratory Co., Ltd., Purity 99.99, denoted as -Ga 2 O 3 ) was also tested for the comparison.The 0.5 wt Ag co-catalyst was loaded by a photodeposition method with using AgNO 3 (Kishida Chemical Co., Ltd., Purity 99.8) as a precursor.However, the loaded Ag co-catalyst on nsGa 2 O 3 was unstable in water under UV light irradiation to be oxidized or reduced to large metallic particles, resulting in the loss of catalytic activity.Recently we have succeeded to control and stabilize the size and distribution of Ag nanoparticles (Ag NPs) on Ga 2 O photocatalysts with using aqueous solution of methanol 17.Therefore, the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction tests were conducted using the aqueous solution of methanol with the optimized concentration of vol, which made Ag-NPs stable during the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction tests and gave reproducible results to compare the photocatalytic activities of synthesized nsGa 2 O 3 with that of -Ga 2 O 3 . Three samples thus prepared were subjected to photocatalytic CO reduction tests; two samples consisting of the phase (nsGa 2 O 3 (1023 K) and ns Ga 2 O 3 (1123 K)), and -Ga 2 O 3 with Ag loaded as a co-catalyst.The loaded amounts were determined as 0.24, 0.39 and 0.33 wt, respectively from X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy measurement .Three samples are referred to as Ag/nsGa 2 O 3 (1023 K), Ag/nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) and Ag/-Ga 2 O 3 ) hereafter. The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction tests were carried out in a fixedbed flow reactor cell.50 mg of the sample was dispersed in the aqueous solution of 10 mL of NaHCO 3 (1 M) and 2 mL of methanol.The air in the cell was replaced with CO 2 gas with the flow rate of 50 mL/min for 30 min.Then, the tests were conducted with UV irradiation under the CO 2 gas with the flow rate of 3.0 mL/min.A 300 W Xe lamp was used as the UV source and its light intensity was about 25 mW/cm 2 in the wavelength range of 254 10 nm.The reaction products (mainly CO and H 2 ) were analyzed by a gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector.Without the CO 2 flow in the reaction cell, the amount of produced CO was very small.This confirms that methanol hardly influenced the CO 2 reduction in the present experiments as already found in previous works 17,18. For understanding of the formation process of nsGa 2 O 3 , thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted with a Thermo plus EVO2 (Rigaku) using a Pt pan sample holder in air, with a heating rate of 5 K/ min.Characterization of samples was performed by a transmission electron microscope (TEM), a scanning electron microscope (SEM), Xray diffraction (XRD), X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) and UV-Vis diffuse reflectance (UV-Vis DR).Specific surface area (SSA) was also measured. TEM images of the samples were acquired with JEM-2100F, operating at 200 kV.SEM images of the samples were acquired with JSM-6500F, operating at 15 kV.XRD patterns of the samples were recorded on a MiniFlex600 (Rigaku) using Cu K as a radiation source with an operating voltage of 40 kV and current of 15 mA.The XRD patterns were collected at 2 angles of 10-80 .The 2 step size was 0.02 , and the scanning rate was 5 /min.Ga K-edge XAFS spectra of nsGa 2 O 3 were measured at the beamline 5S1 in Aichi Synchrotron Radiation Center using a Si(1 1 1) double-crystal monochromator at RT.The data were recorded in a transmission mode.Ga L 3 -edge XAFS spectra were recorded in a fluorescence yield mode at beamline 2A in UVSOR, Institute for Molecular Science, using beryl double-crystal monochromator at RT. SSA of the samples were determined by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) SSA measurements at 77 K (liquid N 2 temperature) using Monosorb (Quantachrome).Before the BET measurements, the samples were heated at 573 K for 3 h in N 2 atmosphere as a pretreatment.The adsorbed amounts of CO 2 on nsGa 2 O 3 samples and their chemical states were investigated by in-situ FT-IR measurements using FT/IR-6100 (JASCO) in the transmission mode at RT.The sample (ca.15 mg) was pressed into a disk (diameter: 10 mm) at 50 MPa and placed in an in-situ IR cell equipped with CaF 2 window.The cell allowed us in-situ measurements as well as sample heating, introduction of the reactant gas and UV light irradiation.Before the in-situ measurement, the sample was pretreated with evacuation at RT for 3 h.UV-Vis DR spectra were measured at RT using a spectrometer (JASCO V-670).The spectrum of Ba 2 SO 4 was used as the reference.The concentration of loaded Ag on Ga 2 O 3 was determined by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) measurement using with EDX-720 (Shimadzu) whose primary X-ray source is Rh. As mentioned in the experimental section, GO was partly reduced and GaO x /rGO was produced during the heat treatment at 453 K in the autoclave.The following calcination of GaO x /rGO at higher temperature resulted in the planar aggregates of nsGa 2 O 3 by removing rGO and full oxidation of GaO x .In order to understand the above process, TGA was done both for GO and GaO x /rGO in the temperatures ranging from to 900 K.The results were given in Fig. 2. The weight losses of GO appeared at around 320 K and 500 K were caused by water desorption and oxidative evaporation of functional groups such as -OH and -COOH in GO, respectively 21.The full combustion of carbon started at around 800 K and completed at 900 K.In the TGA profile of GaO x / rGO, the gradual loss continued until the final full combustion.Since no clear loss corresponding to the evaporation of the functional groups was observed, GO must be mildly reduced during the autoclave treatment.That is the reason for using the terminology of rGO.Even if there was the evaporation of the functional groups, the weight gain caused by the oxidation of GaOx could hinder the evaporation loss.After the full combustion at around 900 K only Ga 2 O 3 remained.From the weight of the remained Ga 2 O 3 , we have determined the loading amount of Ga 2 O in the GaO x /rGO to be 25 wt which included some uncertainty caused by the full oxidation of GaOx to Ga 2 O 3 . Fig. 3 shows SEM images of GaO x /rGO, and Fig. 4 shows TEM images of GO and GaO x /rGO.The SEM images clearly show that GaO x /rGO is consisting of petal-like sheets with their width of around a few m.Each sheet of GaO x /rGO is transparent in the TEM image.The sheet seems homogenous and a little thicker than GO sheet except some segregation of GaO x which is appreciable as local black colored areas.The existence of GaO x on rGO was confirmed by the appearance of amorphous like patterns in XRD (See Fig. 7(a)).In EXAFS analysis, the existence of GaO x was also confirmed, and the bonding or coordination of a gallium atom to the first and second neighboring ones were depicted as described below. In Fig. 1 is indicated how nsGa 2 O 3 synthesis proceeded according to the obtained results.(Fig. 5(a,b)), respectively.As for RSFs, the first peak around 1-2 A was assigned to the backscattering from adjacent atoms to a gallium atom, corresponding to Ga-O bond for both -Ga 2 O 3 and GaO x /rGO.Although the second peak around 2.5-3 A appeared in the RSF of GaO x /rGO (Fig. 5(c)) seems well corresponding to the second-neighboring Ga atoms (Ga-(O)-Ga) appeared in the RSF of -Ga 2 O 3 (Fig. 5(d)) 222324, the curve-fitting analysis of GaO x /rGO suggests that the second peak is caused by Ga-O and Ga-C bonds having longer interatomic distances than first neighboring Ga-O bond.The appearance of these longer Ga-O and Ga-C bonds is likely caused by the junction between GaO x species and rGO in atomic scales.The absence of Ga-(O)-Ga bond also suggests GaO x species on rGO were highly dispersed rather than aggregated. Fig. 6 compares TEM images of nsGa 2 O 3 (823-1123 K) and -Ga 2 O 3 .The images clearly indicate the difference in the morphology among synthesized nsGa 2 O 3 and -Ga 2 O 3 .It should be noted that two dimensional structure of the GaO x /rGO was maintained after the removal of the rGO.Thus, sheet-like materials consisting of nano-sized polycrystalline were successfully synthesized by the present method.Although the average size of polycrystalline became larger with increasing the calcination temperature, planar aggregate structures made of nano-particulates were maintained even for nsGa 2 O 3 calcined at such high temperature as 1123 K (sample nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K)). Table 1 shows the results of BET SSA measurements for nsGa 2 O 3 (823-1123 K) and -Ga 2 O 3 .It should be noted that SSA of nsGa 2 O 3 (823-1123 K) are larger than that of -Ga 2 O 3 about 18, 11, 9.8 and 6.5 times, respectively. In Fig. 7, XRD patterns of GaO x /rGO, nsGa 2 O 3 (823-1123 K) and -Ga 2 O 3 were compared.The XRD pattern of GaO x /rGO spreads widely with low intensity, including a broad peak assigned to (0 0 2) plane of graphite (Fig. 7(a)) 25.This indicates that very thin amorphous like GaO x or highly dispersed small GaO x particles were loaded on rGO.As the calcination temperature increased, the crystallinity of nsGa 2 O samples was improved.The higher the crystallinity of nsGa 2 O 3 became, the smaller SSA was.The XRD patterns of nsGa 2 O 3 (823, 923 K) were consisting of the mixed diffraction patterns of -Ga 2 O 3 and -Ga 2 O 3 , while those of nsGa 2 O 3 (1023, 1123 K) were assigned to the single phase of -Ga 2 O 3 .Thus, after removing rGO from GaO x /rGO by calcination, GaO x turned to be aggregation of nano-sized particles, which maintained the sheet like form and consisted of mixed phases of and by calcination at 823-923 K.The calcination above 1023 K made all particles to the single phase of -Ga 2 O 3 . The crystallite size was calculated from the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the most intense diffraction peak using the Scherrer's equation as shown in Table 1.Since the crystallite sizes derived from the Scherrer's equation was consistent with that observed in the TEM images in Fig. 6(b),(d),(f) and (h), it can be concluded that nsGa 2 O 3 were formed by crystallization of amorphous like Ga 2 O 3 sheet and aggregation of the crystallized nano-particles with keeping the sheet like form.Fig. 8 compares Ga L 3 -edge XANES spectra of single phases of , and in (a) with those of nsGa 2 O 3 in (b).It is known that Ga L 3 -edge XAFS analysis gives more detailed information on the local symmetry structures of nsGa 2 O 3 compared with Ga K-edge XAFS analysis 14,26.As seen in Fig. 8 (a), the intensities of the peak around 1107 eV decreases in the order of -Ga 2 O 3 , -Ga 2 O 3 and -Ga 2 O 3 .The main difference among these three phases is number density of hexacoordinated Ga atoms structure; the highest one is -Ga 2 O 3 in which all Ga atoms are hexacoordinated, the second, -Ga 2 O 3 including some tetracoordinated Ga atoms, and the least, -Ga 2 O 3 consisting of hexacoordinated Ga and tetracoordinated Ga atoms evenly. As shown in Fig. 8(b), the peak intensity around 1107 eV of the Ga L 3 -edge XANES spectra of nsGa 2 O 3 decreased with increasing the calcination temperature.This indicates that nsGa 2 O 3 calcined at lower temperature were mainly composed of hexacoordinated Ga atoms, while the calcination of nsGa 2 O 3 at higher temperature increases tetracoordinated Ga atmos.This is consistent with the results of XRD measurement. Although Ga K-edge EXAFS spectra of nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) and -Ga 2 O were similar with each other (Fig. 9(a)), derived RSFs from them showed the important difference; the second peak at around 2.7 A attributed to Ga-(O)-Ga bond was lower for nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) than that of -Ga 2 O 3 (See Fig. 9(b)).Using the curve fitting, the coordination number for Ga-(O)-Ga bond was evaluated and given in Table 2.The coordination number in nsGa 2 O 3 is a little smaller than that in -Ga 2 O 3 .Considering that EXAFS provides sub-nm or nm sized local structure, the difference in the coordination number suggests that nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) consisting of -Ga 2 O 3 crystalline structure is a little defective compared to fully crystalized one, owing to its very thin planer structure consisting of nano-particulates. Fig. 10 compares the production rates of H 2 and CO and the selectivity toward CO evolution observed for three tested samples in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction using aqueous solution with methanol.H 2 and CO were continuously evolved throughout the reaction tests for both samples.CO production rate of Ag/nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) was over 2 times higher than that of Ag/-Ga 2 O 3 , while H 2 production rate was lower.Consequently, CO selectivity (the ratio of CO production amount to total amounts of reduction products) of Ag/nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) reached 70.nsGa 2 O 3 (1023 K) showed a little less activity than that for nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K), probably because its crystallinity was less than that of the latter.Hence the discussion was focused to comparison of Ag/ nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) and Ag/-Ga 2 O 3. Since CO could be evolved from methanol or NaHCO 3, the reduction test without CO 2 flow was conducted.As shown in Fig. 11, the CO production rate without CO 2 flow was only 1.5-3.4mol/h.Furthermore, no CO production was observed without Ag/nsGa 2 O 3 .Therefore, it is confirmed that most of the generated CO was derived from the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction and nsGa 2 O 3 prepared by the present method was suitable for CO 2 reduction rather than H 2 production from water compared to -Ga 2 O 3 used here. It was found that nsGa 2 O 3 (sheet-like nanometer-sized particulate Ga 2 O 3 ) exhibiting well crystallized -phase gave better performance in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction than that given by -Ga 2 O 3 .The improvement is, in some sense, a corollary of ultrafine particulation, as appeared in the increase of SSA.Still nsGa 2 O 3 exhibits different characters relating photocatalytic activity compared with those of -Ga 2 O 3 .They are CO 2 absorption capability and states of Ag cocatalyst on them. To reveal the adsorbed species on nsGa 2 O 3 and -Ga 2 O 3 as prepared, in-situ FT-IR measurements were conducted.Fig. 12 shows FT-IR spectra in wavelength range 2600-3800 cm -1 , which represent adsorbed water or hydroxyl groups on nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) and -Ga 2 O 3 .The larger peak intensity for nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) than -Ga 2 O 3 well corresponds to the larger SSA of the former.Since nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) exhibiting -Ga 2 O phase was a little defective compared to fully crystalized one, included defects in nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) likely contribute to provide adsorption sites for hydroxyl groups.To make detailed comparison on adsorbed hydroxyl groups on both samples, the two FT-IR spectra are compared by normalizing with their peak intensity at 3463 cm -1 as the inset of Fig. 12.Two peaks at 3720 and 3653 cm -1 are appreciable, which are assigned to the stretching vibration of single and bridge bonded hydroxyl groups, respectively 27.The larger intensity of these peaks for nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) than -Ga 2 O 3 indicates that the former adsorbed more hydroxyl groups compared to the latter.Fig. 13 shows the difference FT-IR spectra of the adsorbed species on nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) and -Ga 2 O 3 after introduction of 45 Torr of CO 2 .The absorption bands at 1635 and 1420 cm -1 are assigned to asymmetric CO 3 stretching vibration as (CO 3 ) and symmetric CO 3 stretching vibration s (CO 3 ) of monodentate bicarbonate species, respectively 28293031, while the bands at 1590 and 1320 cm -1 are attributed to as (CO 3 ) and s (CO 3 ) of bidentate carbonate species, respectively 282930.CO 2 molecules would react with the surface hydroxyl groups and the surface lattice oxygen of Ga 2 O 3 to form the monodentate bicarbonate species and bidentate carbonate species 32,33.The former is assigned to be an intermediated state for CO production over Ga 2 O 34.The significant increases of monodentate bicarbonate species on nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) compared to those on -Ga 2 O 3 could be one of the causes for the higher CO production on nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K). Fig. 14 shows UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra of nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) and -Ga 2 O 3 with comparison of Ag/nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) and Ag/-Ga 2 O after use for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction test.Before the Ag loading, the absorption derived from the bandgap transition of Ga 2 O appeared at 290 nm in both samples (Fig. 14a).As for Ag/ nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) and Ag/-Ga 2 O 3 after use (Fig. 14b), an absorption peak around 430 nm attributed to localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of small Ag nanoparticle (Ag NPs) was observed 33.It should be mentioned that without methanol addition, Ag-NPs on nsGa 2 O 3 were not stable and the absorption peak around 430 nm were broadened and/ or decreased, accompanying the activity loss.Recently, we have found the nearly linear relationship of the LSPR intensity (i.e., the number density of small Ag NPs) and the CO production rate and concluded that Ag NPs showing the LSPR absorption peak are active sites for the CO reduction 17.Since the LSPR peaks were sharp and more intense in The size distributions are given in Fig. 16.Thus ultrafine particulation of Ga 2 O 3 seems to stabilize AgNPs to be ca.20 nm or less, the suitable size as Ag cocatalyst by avoiding their aggregation. We have succeeded in synthesizing sheet-like Ga 2 O 3 (nsGa 2 O 3 ) with using GO as a template by loading Ga 2 O 3 precursor on GO followed by GO removal by calcination at higher temperatures.The synthesized nsGa 2 O 3 consists of the planner aggregation of the nanometer-sized Ga 2 O 3 particles which are much smaller than those of Ga 2 O 3 synthesized by a simple calcination such as commercially available -Ga 2 O 3 and other synthesized Ga 2 O 3 samples in our previous work 5.Accordingly, the specific surface area (SSA) of nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) was much larger than that of -Ga 2 O 3 .The crystallinity and crystalline phase of nsGa 2 O 3 were changed with the calcination temperature.Among all synthesized nsGa 2 O 3 samples, nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) which was consisted of the only -phase showed the highest CO production rate and CO selectivity in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with water including NaHCO 3 and methanol. Thus, we can conclude that nsGa 2 O 3 (sheet-like nanometer-sized particulate Ga 2 O 3 ) exhibiting well crystalized -phase gives better performance in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.At the present stage, it is difficult to mention the particular cause for the improvement.Observed changes in characters relating the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction are the increase of SSA, larger CO 2 adsorption ability and the loading state of Ag co-catalyst.Those are in some sense a corollary of ultrafine particulation.Still the crystalline phase and crystallite size of nsGa 2 O 3 were not fully controlled, it remains as a future work to optimize them for further improvement of the activity of nsGa 2 O 3 for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.

This work was supported continuously by Prof. Takenaka, Mr. Sugiyama and Mr. Suzuki of Doshisya University in the preparation of Ga 2 O 3 nano-sheets.Synchrotron experiments were carried out at Aichi Synchrotron Radiation Center and UVSOR Institute for Molecular Science which are supported by No. 2503042 and 2019-510, respectively.This work was supported by Kansai Research Foundation for Technology Promotion.", "vote": "1"}], "light source": [{"llm generation": "UV", "source": "Furthermore, Ag loaded nsGa 2 O 3 calcined at 1123 K (Ag/nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K)) showed very high photocatalytic activity for CO production in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction test in water including methanol under UV light irradiation.", "context": "Since the activity of semiconductor photocatalysts for CO 2 reduction with water is still low, it is necessary to improve their activity.To do this, the optimization of particle size and crystal structure of the photocatalysts is one of the promising ways.In previous studies, we have reported that micro-particulate Ga 2 O 3 deposited on Al 2 O 3 support significantly improves the photocatalytic activity of CO 2 reduction.However, it is quite difficult to synthesize nano-particulate Ga 2 O 3 with high crystallinity by calcination at higher temperatures.In this work, we have tried to synthesize sheet-like nano-particulate Ga 2 O 3 using graphene oxide (GO) as a template for the first time.After loading gallium butoxide on GO, it was calcined to oxidize the gallium butoxide into Ga 2 O 3 and also to remove GO.Various spectroscopic analyses revealed that the synthesized materials were planar aggregation of nanometer-sized Ga 2 O 3 particles (nsGa 2 O 3 ), of which sizes and crystallinity could be controlled with the calcination temperature.The nsGa 2 O 3 calcined at 1123 K was well crystallized and showed -phase with a quite large specific surface area.Furthermore, Ag loaded nsGa 2 O 3 calcined at 1123 K (Ag/nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K)) showed very high photocatalytic activity for CO production in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction test in water including methanol under UV light irradiation.Thus, it is confirmed that the planar aggregation of nanometer-sized Ga 2 O 3 significantly improves the photocatalytic activity of Ga 2 O 3 on the CO 2 reduction.", "vote": "1"}, {"llm generation": "UV", "source": "Then, the tests were conducted with UV irradiation under the CO 2 gas with the flow rate of 3.0 mL/min.", "context": "Fig. 1 schematically shows synthesis processes, in which the results of characterizations given in the following sections were included.500 mg of dried GO which was obtained by the exfoliation of the graphitic oxide 19,20 following the Hummer's method 21 and 1.53 g of Ga (OnC 4 H 9 ) 3 (referred to as Ga(OBu) 3 ) were suspended in 500 mL of cyclohexane (super dehydrated, Wako Pure Chemicals).The suspension was stirred at room temperature (RT) for several days in order to disperse dried GO in cyclohexane homogeneously and to load Ga(OBu) 3 on the dried GO.Above processes were carried out in a nitrogen purged glove box because Ga(OBu) 3 is highly deliquescent.The obtained material is denoted as Ga(OBu) 3 /GO.Ga(OBu) 3 /GO was dispersed in 540 mL of cyclohexane and transferred to Teflon containers in a stainlesssteel autoclave.Then the autoclave was heated at 453 K for 6 h.During the heating, Ga(OBu) 3 was mostly oxidized to be GaO x and GO was partly reduced and referred to as rGO.Then, the resultant material was centrifuged and dried in a vacuum overnight to get GaO x /rGO.Finally, GaO x /rGO was calcined in air at a temperature ranging from 823 to 1123 K for 2 h (temperature raising rate: 2 C/min) to get sheet-like nsGa 2 O 3 (denoted as nsGa 2 O 3 (X K), where X indicates the calcination temperature). Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction tests were conducted using nsGa 2 O 3 with Ag loading as a co-catalyst.Commercially available -Ga 2 O 3 (Kojundo Chemical Laboratory Co., Ltd., Purity 99.99, denoted as -Ga 2 O 3 ) was also tested for the comparison.The 0.5 wt Ag co-catalyst was loaded by a photodeposition method with using AgNO 3 (Kishida Chemical Co., Ltd., Purity 99.8) as a precursor.However, the loaded Ag co-catalyst on nsGa 2 O 3 was unstable in water under UV light irradiation to be oxidized or reduced to large metallic particles, resulting in the loss of catalytic activity.Recently we have succeeded to control and stabilize the size and distribution of Ag nanoparticles (Ag NPs) on Ga 2 O photocatalysts with using aqueous solution of methanol 17.Therefore, the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction tests were conducted using the aqueous solution of methanol with the optimized concentration of vol, which made Ag-NPs stable during the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction tests and gave reproducible results to compare the photocatalytic activities of synthesized nsGa 2 O 3 with that of -Ga 2 O 3 . Three samples thus prepared were subjected to photocatalytic CO reduction tests; two samples consisting of the phase (nsGa 2 O 3 (1023 K) and ns Ga 2 O 3 (1123 K)), and -Ga 2 O 3 with Ag loaded as a co-catalyst.The loaded amounts were determined as 0.24, 0.39 and 0.33 wt, respectively from X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy measurement .Three samples are referred to as Ag/nsGa 2 O 3 (1023 K), Ag/nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) and Ag/-Ga 2 O 3 ) hereafter. The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction tests were carried out in a fixedbed flow reactor cell.50 mg of the sample was dispersed in the aqueous solution of 10 mL of NaHCO 3 (1 M) and 2 mL of methanol.The air in the cell was replaced with CO 2 gas with the flow rate of 50 mL/min for 30 min.Then, the tests were conducted with UV irradiation under the CO 2 gas with the flow rate of 3.0 mL/min.A 300 W Xe lamp was used as the UV source and its light intensity was about 25 mW/cm 2 in the wavelength range of 254 10 nm.The reaction products (mainly CO and H 2 ) were analyzed by a gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector.Without the CO 2 flow in the reaction cell, the amount of produced CO was very small.This confirms that methanol hardly influenced the CO 2 reduction in the present experiments as already found in previous works 17,18. For understanding of the formation process of nsGa 2 O 3 , thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted with a Thermo plus EVO2 (Rigaku) using a Pt pan sample holder in air, with a heating rate of 5 K/ min.Characterization of samples was performed by a transmission electron microscope (TEM), a scanning electron microscope (SEM), Xray diffraction (XRD), X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) and UV-Vis diffuse reflectance (UV-Vis DR).Specific surface area (SSA) was also measured. TEM images of the samples were acquired with JEM-2100F, operating at 200 kV.SEM images of the samples were acquired with JSM-6500F, operating at 15 kV.XRD patterns of the samples were recorded on a MiniFlex600 (Rigaku) using Cu K as a radiation source with an operating voltage of 40 kV and current of 15 mA.The XRD patterns were collected at 2 angles of 10-80 .The 2 step size was 0.02 , and the scanning rate was 5 /min.Ga K-edge XAFS spectra of nsGa 2 O 3 were measured at the beamline 5S1 in Aichi Synchrotron Radiation Center using a Si(1 1 1) double-crystal monochromator at RT.The data were recorded in a transmission mode.Ga L 3 -edge XAFS spectra were recorded in a fluorescence yield mode at beamline 2A in UVSOR, Institute for Molecular Science, using beryl double-crystal monochromator at RT. SSA of the samples were determined by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) SSA measurements at 77 K (liquid N 2 temperature) using Monosorb (Quantachrome).Before the BET measurements, the samples were heated at 573 K for 3 h in N 2 atmosphere as a pretreatment.The adsorbed amounts of CO 2 on nsGa 2 O 3 samples and their chemical states were investigated by in-situ FT-IR measurements using FT/IR-6100 (JASCO) in the transmission mode at RT.The sample (ca.15 mg) was pressed into a disk (diameter: 10 mm) at 50 MPa and placed in an in-situ IR cell equipped with CaF 2 window.The cell allowed us in-situ measurements as well as sample heating, introduction of the reactant gas and UV light irradiation.Before the in-situ measurement, the sample was pretreated with evacuation at RT for 3 h.UV-Vis DR spectra were measured at RT using a spectrometer (JASCO V-670).The spectrum of Ba 2 SO 4 was used as the reference.The concentration of loaded Ag on Ga 2 O 3 was determined by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) measurement using with EDX-720 (Shimadzu) whose primary X-ray source is Rh. As mentioned in the experimental section, GO was partly reduced and GaO x /rGO was produced during the heat treatment at 453 K in the autoclave.The following calcination of GaO x /rGO at higher temperature resulted in the planar aggregates of nsGa 2 O 3 by removing rGO and full oxidation of GaO x .In order to understand the above process, TGA was done both for GO and GaO x /rGO in the temperatures ranging from to 900 K.The results were given in Fig. 2. The weight losses of GO appeared at around 320 K and 500 K were caused by water desorption and oxidative evaporation of functional groups such as -OH and -COOH in GO, respectively 21.The full combustion of carbon started at around 800 K and completed at 900 K.In the TGA profile of GaO x / rGO, the gradual loss continued until the final full combustion.Since no clear loss corresponding to the evaporation of the functional groups was observed, GO must be mildly reduced during the autoclave treatment.That is the reason for using the terminology of rGO.Even if there was the evaporation of the functional groups, the weight gain caused by the oxidation of GaOx could hinder the evaporation loss.After the full combustion at around 900 K only Ga 2 O 3 remained.From the weight of the remained Ga 2 O 3 , we have determined the loading amount of Ga 2 O in the GaO x /rGO to be 25 wt which included some uncertainty caused by the full oxidation of GaOx to Ga 2 O 3 . Fig. 3 shows SEM images of GaO x /rGO, and Fig. 4 shows TEM images of GO and GaO x /rGO.The SEM images clearly show that GaO x /rGO is consisting of petal-like sheets with their width of around a few m.Each sheet of GaO x /rGO is transparent in the TEM image.The sheet seems homogenous and a little thicker than GO sheet except some segregation of GaO x which is appreciable as local black colored areas.The existence of GaO x on rGO was confirmed by the appearance of amorphous like patterns in XRD (See Fig. 7(a)).In EXAFS analysis, the existence of GaO x was also confirmed, and the bonding or coordination of a gallium atom to the first and second neighboring ones were depicted as described below. In Fig. 1 is indicated how nsGa 2 O 3 synthesis proceeded according to the obtained results.(Fig. 5(a,b)), respectively.As for RSFs, the first peak around 1-2 A was assigned to the backscattering from adjacent atoms to a gallium atom, corresponding to Ga-O bond for both -Ga 2 O 3 and GaO x /rGO.Although the second peak around 2.5-3 A appeared in the RSF of GaO x /rGO (Fig. 5(c)) seems well corresponding to the second-neighboring Ga atoms (Ga-(O)-Ga) appeared in the RSF of -Ga 2 O 3 (Fig. 5(d)) 222324, the curve-fitting analysis of GaO x /rGO suggests that the second peak is caused by Ga-O and Ga-C bonds having longer interatomic distances than first neighboring Ga-O bond.The appearance of these longer Ga-O and Ga-C bonds is likely caused by the junction between GaO x species and rGO in atomic scales.The absence of Ga-(O)-Ga bond also suggests GaO x species on rGO were highly dispersed rather than aggregated. Fig. 6 compares TEM images of nsGa 2 O 3 (823-1123 K) and -Ga 2 O 3 .The images clearly indicate the difference in the morphology among synthesized nsGa 2 O 3 and -Ga 2 O 3 .It should be noted that two dimensional structure of the GaO x /rGO was maintained after the removal of the rGO.Thus, sheet-like materials consisting of nano-sized polycrystalline were successfully synthesized by the present method.Although the average size of polycrystalline became larger with increasing the calcination temperature, planar aggregate structures made of nano-particulates were maintained even for nsGa 2 O 3 calcined at such high temperature as 1123 K (sample nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K)). Table 1 shows the results of BET SSA measurements for nsGa 2 O 3 (823-1123 K) and -Ga 2 O 3 .It should be noted that SSA of nsGa 2 O 3 (823-1123 K) are larger than that of -Ga 2 O 3 about 18, 11, 9.8 and 6.5 times, respectively. In Fig. 7, XRD patterns of GaO x /rGO, nsGa 2 O 3 (823-1123 K) and -Ga 2 O 3 were compared.The XRD pattern of GaO x /rGO spreads widely with low intensity, including a broad peak assigned to (0 0 2) plane of graphite (Fig. 7(a)) 25.This indicates that very thin amorphous like GaO x or highly dispersed small GaO x particles were loaded on rGO.As the calcination temperature increased, the crystallinity of nsGa 2 O samples was improved.The higher the crystallinity of nsGa 2 O 3 became, the smaller SSA was.The XRD patterns of nsGa 2 O 3 (823, 923 K) were consisting of the mixed diffraction patterns of -Ga 2 O 3 and -Ga 2 O 3 , while those of nsGa 2 O 3 (1023, 1123 K) were assigned to the single phase of -Ga 2 O 3 .Thus, after removing rGO from GaO x /rGO by calcination, GaO x turned to be aggregation of nano-sized particles, which maintained the sheet like form and consisted of mixed phases of and by calcination at 823-923 K.The calcination above 1023 K made all particles to the single phase of -Ga 2 O 3 . The crystallite size was calculated from the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the most intense diffraction peak using the Scherrer's equation as shown in Table 1.Since the crystallite sizes derived from the Scherrer's equation was consistent with that observed in the TEM images in Fig. 6(b),(d),(f) and (h), it can be concluded that nsGa 2 O 3 were formed by crystallization of amorphous like Ga 2 O 3 sheet and aggregation of the crystallized nano-particles with keeping the sheet like form.Fig. 8 compares Ga L 3 -edge XANES spectra of single phases of , and in (a) with those of nsGa 2 O 3 in (b).It is known that Ga L 3 -edge XAFS analysis gives more detailed information on the local symmetry structures of nsGa 2 O 3 compared with Ga K-edge XAFS analysis 14,26.As seen in Fig. 8 (a), the intensities of the peak around 1107 eV decreases in the order of -Ga 2 O 3 , -Ga 2 O 3 and -Ga 2 O 3 .The main difference among these three phases is number density of hexacoordinated Ga atoms structure; the highest one is -Ga 2 O 3 in which all Ga atoms are hexacoordinated, the second, -Ga 2 O 3 including some tetracoordinated Ga atoms, and the least, -Ga 2 O 3 consisting of hexacoordinated Ga and tetracoordinated Ga atoms evenly. As shown in Fig. 8(b), the peak intensity around 1107 eV of the Ga L 3 -edge XANES spectra of nsGa 2 O 3 decreased with increasing the calcination temperature.This indicates that nsGa 2 O 3 calcined at lower temperature were mainly composed of hexacoordinated Ga atoms, while the calcination of nsGa 2 O 3 at higher temperature increases tetracoordinated Ga atmos.This is consistent with the results of XRD measurement. Although Ga K-edge EXAFS spectra of nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) and -Ga 2 O were similar with each other (Fig. 9(a)), derived RSFs from them showed the important difference; the second peak at around 2.7 A attributed to Ga-(O)-Ga bond was lower for nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) than that of -Ga 2 O 3 (See Fig. 9(b)).Using the curve fitting, the coordination number for Ga-(O)-Ga bond was evaluated and given in Table 2.The coordination number in nsGa 2 O 3 is a little smaller than that in -Ga 2 O 3 .Considering that EXAFS provides sub-nm or nm sized local structure, the difference in the coordination number suggests that nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) consisting of -Ga 2 O 3 crystalline structure is a little defective compared to fully crystalized one, owing to its very thin planer structure consisting of nano-particulates. Fig. 10 compares the production rates of H 2 and CO and the selectivity toward CO evolution observed for three tested samples in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction using aqueous solution with methanol.H 2 and CO were continuously evolved throughout the reaction tests for both samples.CO production rate of Ag/nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) was over 2 times higher than that of Ag/-Ga 2 O 3 , while H 2 production rate was lower.Consequently, CO selectivity (the ratio of CO production amount to total amounts of reduction products) of Ag/nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) reached 70.nsGa 2 O 3 (1023 K) showed a little less activity than that for nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K), probably because its crystallinity was less than that of the latter.Hence the discussion was focused to comparison of Ag/ nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) and Ag/-Ga 2 O 3. Since CO could be evolved from methanol or NaHCO 3, the reduction test without CO 2 flow was conducted.As shown in Fig. 11, the CO production rate without CO 2 flow was only 1.5-3.4mol/h.Furthermore, no CO production was observed without Ag/nsGa 2 O 3 .Therefore, it is confirmed that most of the generated CO was derived from the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction and nsGa 2 O 3 prepared by the present method was suitable for CO 2 reduction rather than H 2 production from water compared to -Ga 2 O 3 used here. It was found that nsGa 2 O 3 (sheet-like nanometer-sized particulate Ga 2 O 3 ) exhibiting well crystallized -phase gave better performance in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction than that given by -Ga 2 O 3 .The improvement is, in some sense, a corollary of ultrafine particulation, as appeared in the increase of SSA.Still nsGa 2 O 3 exhibits different characters relating photocatalytic activity compared with those of -Ga 2 O 3 .They are CO 2 absorption capability and states of Ag cocatalyst on them. To reveal the adsorbed species on nsGa 2 O 3 and -Ga 2 O 3 as prepared, in-situ FT-IR measurements were conducted.Fig. 12 shows FT-IR spectra in wavelength range 2600-3800 cm -1 , which represent adsorbed water or hydroxyl groups on nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) and -Ga 2 O 3 .The larger peak intensity for nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) than -Ga 2 O 3 well corresponds to the larger SSA of the former.Since nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) exhibiting -Ga 2 O phase was a little defective compared to fully crystalized one, included defects in nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) likely contribute to provide adsorption sites for hydroxyl groups.To make detailed comparison on adsorbed hydroxyl groups on both samples, the two FT-IR spectra are compared by normalizing with their peak intensity at 3463 cm -1 as the inset of Fig. 12.Two peaks at 3720 and 3653 cm -1 are appreciable, which are assigned to the stretching vibration of single and bridge bonded hydroxyl groups, respectively 27.The larger intensity of these peaks for nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) than -Ga 2 O 3 indicates that the former adsorbed more hydroxyl groups compared to the latter.Fig. 13 shows the difference FT-IR spectra of the adsorbed species on nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) and -Ga 2 O 3 after introduction of 45 Torr of CO 2 .The absorption bands at 1635 and 1420 cm -1 are assigned to asymmetric CO 3 stretching vibration as (CO 3 ) and symmetric CO 3 stretching vibration s (CO 3 ) of monodentate bicarbonate species, respectively 28293031, while the bands at 1590 and 1320 cm -1 are attributed to as (CO 3 ) and s (CO 3 ) of bidentate carbonate species, respectively 282930.CO 2 molecules would react with the surface hydroxyl groups and the surface lattice oxygen of Ga 2 O 3 to form the monodentate bicarbonate species and bidentate carbonate species 32,33.The former is assigned to be an intermediated state for CO production over Ga 2 O 34.The significant increases of monodentate bicarbonate species on nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) compared to those on -Ga 2 O 3 could be one of the causes for the higher CO production on nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K). Fig. 14 shows UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra of nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) and -Ga 2 O 3 with comparison of Ag/nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) and Ag/-Ga 2 O after use for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction test.Before the Ag loading, the absorption derived from the bandgap transition of Ga 2 O appeared at 290 nm in both samples (Fig. 14a).As for Ag/ nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) and Ag/-Ga 2 O 3 after use (Fig. 14b), an absorption peak around 430 nm attributed to localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of small Ag nanoparticle (Ag NPs) was observed 33.It should be mentioned that without methanol addition, Ag-NPs on nsGa 2 O 3 were not stable and the absorption peak around 430 nm were broadened and/ or decreased, accompanying the activity loss.Recently, we have found the nearly linear relationship of the LSPR intensity (i.e., the number density of small Ag NPs) and the CO production rate and concluded that Ag NPs showing the LSPR absorption peak are active sites for the CO reduction 17.Since the LSPR peaks were sharp and more intense in The size distributions are given in Fig. 16.Thus ultrafine particulation of Ga 2 O 3 seems to stabilize AgNPs to be ca.20 nm or less, the suitable size as Ag cocatalyst by avoiding their aggregation. We have succeeded in synthesizing sheet-like Ga 2 O 3 (nsGa 2 O 3 ) with using GO as a template by loading Ga 2 O 3 precursor on GO followed by GO removal by calcination at higher temperatures.The synthesized nsGa 2 O 3 consists of the planner aggregation of the nanometer-sized Ga 2 O 3 particles which are much smaller than those of Ga 2 O 3 synthesized by a simple calcination such as commercially available -Ga 2 O 3 and other synthesized Ga 2 O 3 samples in our previous work 5.Accordingly, the specific surface area (SSA) of nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) was much larger than that of -Ga 2 O 3 .The crystallinity and crystalline phase of nsGa 2 O 3 were changed with the calcination temperature.Among all synthesized nsGa 2 O 3 samples, nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) which was consisted of the only -phase showed the highest CO production rate and CO selectivity in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with water including NaHCO 3 and methanol. Thus, we can conclude that nsGa 2 O 3 (sheet-like nanometer-sized particulate Ga 2 O 3 ) exhibiting well crystalized -phase gives better performance in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.At the present stage, it is difficult to mention the particular cause for the improvement.Observed changes in characters relating the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction are the increase of SSA, larger CO 2 adsorption ability and the loading state of Ag co-catalyst.Those are in some sense a corollary of ultrafine particulation.Still the crystalline phase and crystallite size of nsGa 2 O 3 were not fully controlled, it remains as a future work to optimize them for further improvement of the activity of nsGa 2 O 3 for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.

Thus, we can conclude that nsGa 2 O 3 (sheet-like nanometer-sized particulate Ga 2 O 3 ) exhibiting well crystalized -phase gives better performance in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.At the present stage, it is difficult to mention the particular cause for the improvement.Observed changes in characters relating the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction are the increase of SSA, larger CO 2 adsorption ability and the loading state of Ag co-catalyst.Those are in some sense a corollary of ultrafine particulation.Still the crystalline phase and crystallite size of nsGa 2 O 3 were not fully controlled, it remains as a future work to optimize them for further improvement of the activity of nsGa 2 O 3 for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.

This work was supported continuously by Prof. Takenaka, Mr. Sugiyama and Mr. Suzuki of Doshisya University in the preparation of Ga 2 O 3 nano-sheets.Synchrotron experiments were carried out at Aichi Synchrotron Radiation Center and UVSOR Institute for Molecular Science which are supported by No. 2503042 and 2019-510, respectively.This work was supported by Kansai Research Foundation for Technology Promotion.", "vote": "0"}], "lamp": [{"llm generation": "Xenon", "source": "A 300 W Xe lamp was used as the UV source and its light intensity was about 25 mW/cm 2 in the wavelength range of 254 10 nm.", "context": "Fig. 1 schematically shows synthesis processes, in which the results of characterizations given in the following sections were included.500 mg of dried GO which was obtained by the exfoliation of the graphitic oxide 19,20 following the Hummer's method 21 and 1.53 g of Ga (OnC 4 H 9 ) 3 (referred to as Ga(OBu) 3 ) were suspended in 500 mL of cyclohexane (super dehydrated, Wako Pure Chemicals).The suspension was stirred at room temperature (RT) for several days in order to disperse dried GO in cyclohexane homogeneously and to load Ga(OBu) 3 on the dried GO.Above processes were carried out in a nitrogen purged glove box because Ga(OBu) 3 is highly deliquescent.The obtained material is denoted as Ga(OBu) 3 /GO.Ga(OBu) 3 /GO was dispersed in 540 mL of cyclohexane and transferred to Teflon containers in a stainlesssteel autoclave.Then the autoclave was heated at 453 K for 6 h.During the heating, Ga(OBu) 3 was mostly oxidized to be GaO x and GO was partly reduced and referred to as rGO.Then, the resultant material was centrifuged and dried in a vacuum overnight to get GaO x /rGO.Finally, GaO x /rGO was calcined in air at a temperature ranging from 823 to 1123 K for 2 h (temperature raising rate: 2 C/min) to get sheet-like nsGa 2 O 3 (denoted as nsGa 2 O 3 (X K), where X indicates the calcination temperature). Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction tests were conducted using nsGa 2 O 3 with Ag loading as a co-catalyst.Commercially available -Ga 2 O 3 (Kojundo Chemical Laboratory Co., Ltd., Purity 99.99, denoted as -Ga 2 O 3 ) was also tested for the comparison.The 0.5 wt Ag co-catalyst was loaded by a photodeposition method with using AgNO 3 (Kishida Chemical Co., Ltd., Purity 99.8) as a precursor.However, the loaded Ag co-catalyst on nsGa 2 O 3 was unstable in water under UV light irradiation to be oxidized or reduced to large metallic particles, resulting in the loss of catalytic activity.Recently we have succeeded to control and stabilize the size and distribution of Ag nanoparticles (Ag NPs) on Ga 2 O photocatalysts with using aqueous solution of methanol 17.Therefore, the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction tests were conducted using the aqueous solution of methanol with the optimized concentration of vol, which made Ag-NPs stable during the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction tests and gave reproducible results to compare the photocatalytic activities of synthesized nsGa 2 O 3 with that of -Ga 2 O 3 . Three samples thus prepared were subjected to photocatalytic CO reduction tests; two samples consisting of the phase (nsGa 2 O 3 (1023 K) and ns Ga 2 O 3 (1123 K)), and -Ga 2 O 3 with Ag loaded as a co-catalyst.The loaded amounts were determined as 0.24, 0.39 and 0.33 wt, respectively from X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy measurement .Three samples are referred to as Ag/nsGa 2 O 3 (1023 K), Ag/nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) and Ag/-Ga 2 O 3 ) hereafter. The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction tests were carried out in a fixedbed flow reactor cell.50 mg of the sample was dispersed in the aqueous solution of 10 mL of NaHCO 3 (1 M) and 2 mL of methanol.The air in the cell was replaced with CO 2 gas with the flow rate of 50 mL/min for 30 min.Then, the tests were conducted with UV irradiation under the CO 2 gas with the flow rate of 3.0 mL/min.A 300 W Xe lamp was used as the UV source and its light intensity was about 25 mW/cm 2 in the wavelength range of 254 10 nm.The reaction products (mainly CO and H 2 ) were analyzed by a gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector.Without the CO 2 flow in the reaction cell, the amount of produced CO was very small.This confirms that methanol hardly influenced the CO 2 reduction in the present experiments as already found in previous works 17,18. For understanding of the formation process of nsGa 2 O 3 , thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted with a Thermo plus EVO2 (Rigaku) using a Pt pan sample holder in air, with a heating rate of 5 K/ min.Characterization of samples was performed by a transmission electron microscope (TEM), a scanning electron microscope (SEM), Xray diffraction (XRD), X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) and UV-Vis diffuse reflectance (UV-Vis DR).Specific surface area (SSA) was also measured. TEM images of the samples were acquired with JEM-2100F, operating at 200 kV.SEM images of the samples were acquired with JSM-6500F, operating at 15 kV.XRD patterns of the samples were recorded on a MiniFlex600 (Rigaku) using Cu K as a radiation source with an operating voltage of 40 kV and current of 15 mA.The XRD patterns were collected at 2 angles of 10-80 .The 2 step size was 0.02 , and the scanning rate was 5 /min.Ga K-edge XAFS spectra of nsGa 2 O 3 were measured at the beamline 5S1 in Aichi Synchrotron Radiation Center using a Si(1 1 1) double-crystal monochromator at RT.The data were recorded in a transmission mode.Ga L 3 -edge XAFS spectra were recorded in a fluorescence yield mode at beamline 2A in UVSOR, Institute for Molecular Science, using beryl double-crystal monochromator at RT. SSA of the samples were determined by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) SSA measurements at 77 K (liquid N 2 temperature) using Monosorb (Quantachrome).Before the BET measurements, the samples were heated at 573 K for 3 h in N 2 atmosphere as a pretreatment.The adsorbed amounts of CO 2 on nsGa 2 O 3 samples and their chemical states were investigated by in-situ FT-IR measurements using FT/IR-6100 (JASCO) in the transmission mode at RT.The sample (ca.15 mg) was pressed into a disk (diameter: 10 mm) at 50 MPa and placed in an in-situ IR cell equipped with CaF 2 window.The cell allowed us in-situ measurements as well as sample heating, introduction of the reactant gas and UV light irradiation.Before the in-situ measurement, the sample was pretreated with evacuation at RT for 3 h.UV-Vis DR spectra were measured at RT using a spectrometer (JASCO V-670).The spectrum of Ba 2 SO 4 was used as the reference.The concentration of loaded Ag on Ga 2 O 3 was determined by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) measurement using with EDX-720 (Shimadzu) whose primary X-ray source is Rh. As mentioned in the experimental section, GO was partly reduced and GaO x /rGO was produced during the heat treatment at 453 K in the autoclave.The following calcination of GaO x /rGO at higher temperature resulted in the planar aggregates of nsGa 2 O 3 by removing rGO and full oxidation of GaO x .In order to understand the above process, TGA was done both for GO and GaO x /rGO in the temperatures ranging from to 900 K.The results were given in Fig. 2. The weight losses of GO appeared at around 320 K and 500 K were caused by water desorption and oxidative evaporation of functional groups such as -OH and -COOH in GO, respectively 21.The full combustion of carbon started at around 800 K and completed at 900 K.In the TGA profile of GaO x / rGO, the gradual loss continued until the final full combustion.Since no clear loss corresponding to the evaporation of the functional groups was observed, GO must be mildly reduced during the autoclave treatment.That is the reason for using the terminology of rGO.Even if there was the evaporation of the functional groups, the weight gain caused by the oxidation of GaOx could hinder the evaporation loss.After the full combustion at around 900 K only Ga 2 O 3 remained.From the weight of the remained Ga 2 O 3 , we have determined the loading amount of Ga 2 O in the GaO x /rGO to be 25 wt which included some uncertainty caused by the full oxidation of GaOx to Ga 2 O 3 . Fig. 3 shows SEM images of GaO x /rGO, and Fig. 4 shows TEM images of GO and GaO x /rGO.The SEM images clearly show that GaO x /rGO is consisting of petal-like sheets with their width of around a few m.Each sheet of GaO x /rGO is transparent in the TEM image.The sheet seems homogenous and a little thicker than GO sheet except some segregation of GaO x which is appreciable as local black colored areas.The existence of GaO x on rGO was confirmed by the appearance of amorphous like patterns in XRD (See Fig. 7(a)).In EXAFS analysis, the existence of GaO x was also confirmed, and the bonding or coordination of a gallium atom to the first and second neighboring ones were depicted as described below. In Fig. 1 is indicated how nsGa 2 O 3 synthesis proceeded according to the obtained results.(Fig. 5(a,b)), respectively.As for RSFs, the first peak around 1-2 A was assigned to the backscattering from adjacent atoms to a gallium atom, corresponding to Ga-O bond for both -Ga 2 O 3 and GaO x /rGO.Although the second peak around 2.5-3 A appeared in the RSF of GaO x /rGO (Fig. 5(c)) seems well corresponding to the second-neighboring Ga atoms (Ga-(O)-Ga) appeared in the RSF of -Ga 2 O 3 (Fig. 5(d)) 222324, the curve-fitting analysis of GaO x /rGO suggests that the second peak is caused by Ga-O and Ga-C bonds having longer interatomic distances than first neighboring Ga-O bond.The appearance of these longer Ga-O and Ga-C bonds is likely caused by the junction between GaO x species and rGO in atomic scales.The absence of Ga-(O)-Ga bond also suggests GaO x species on rGO were highly dispersed rather than aggregated. Fig. 6 compares TEM images of nsGa 2 O 3 (823-1123 K) and -Ga 2 O 3 .The images clearly indicate the difference in the morphology among synthesized nsGa 2 O 3 and -Ga 2 O 3 .It should be noted that two dimensional structure of the GaO x /rGO was maintained after the removal of the rGO.Thus, sheet-like materials consisting of nano-sized polycrystalline were successfully synthesized by the present method.Although the average size of polycrystalline became larger with increasing the calcination temperature, planar aggregate structures made of nano-particulates were maintained even for nsGa 2 O 3 calcined at such high temperature as 1123 K (sample nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K)). Table 1 shows the results of BET SSA measurements for nsGa 2 O 3 (823-1123 K) and -Ga 2 O 3 .It should be noted that SSA of nsGa 2 O 3 (823-1123 K) are larger than that of -Ga 2 O 3 about 18, 11, 9.8 and 6.5 times, respectively. In Fig. 7, XRD patterns of GaO x /rGO, nsGa 2 O 3 (823-1123 K) and -Ga 2 O 3 were compared.The XRD pattern of GaO x /rGO spreads widely with low intensity, including a broad peak assigned to (0 0 2) plane of graphite (Fig. 7(a)) 25.This indicates that very thin amorphous like GaO x or highly dispersed small GaO x particles were loaded on rGO.As the calcination temperature increased, the crystallinity of nsGa 2 O samples was improved.The higher the crystallinity of nsGa 2 O 3 became, the smaller SSA was.The XRD patterns of nsGa 2 O 3 (823, 923 K) were consisting of the mixed diffraction patterns of -Ga 2 O 3 and -Ga 2 O 3 , while those of nsGa 2 O 3 (1023, 1123 K) were assigned to the single phase of -Ga 2 O 3 .Thus, after removing rGO from GaO x /rGO by calcination, GaO x turned to be aggregation of nano-sized particles, which maintained the sheet like form and consisted of mixed phases of and by calcination at 823-923 K.The calcination above 1023 K made all particles to the single phase of -Ga 2 O 3 . The crystallite size was calculated from the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the most intense diffraction peak using the Scherrer's equation as shown in Table 1.Since the crystallite sizes derived from the Scherrer's equation was consistent with that observed in the TEM images in Fig. 6(b),(d),(f) and (h), it can be concluded that nsGa 2 O 3 were formed by crystallization of amorphous like Ga 2 O 3 sheet and aggregation of the crystallized nano-particles with keeping the sheet like form.Fig. 8 compares Ga L 3 -edge XANES spectra of single phases of , and in (a) with those of nsGa 2 O 3 in (b).It is known that Ga L 3 -edge XAFS analysis gives more detailed information on the local symmetry structures of nsGa 2 O 3 compared with Ga K-edge XAFS analysis 14,26.As seen in Fig. 8 (a), the intensities of the peak around 1107 eV decreases in the order of -Ga 2 O 3 , -Ga 2 O 3 and -Ga 2 O 3 .The main difference among these three phases is number density of hexacoordinated Ga atoms structure; the highest one is -Ga 2 O 3 in which all Ga atoms are hexacoordinated, the second, -Ga 2 O 3 including some tetracoordinated Ga atoms, and the least, -Ga 2 O 3 consisting of hexacoordinated Ga and tetracoordinated Ga atoms evenly. As shown in Fig. 8(b), the peak intensity around 1107 eV of the Ga L 3 -edge XANES spectra of nsGa 2 O 3 decreased with increasing the calcination temperature.This indicates that nsGa 2 O 3 calcined at lower temperature were mainly composed of hexacoordinated Ga atoms, while the calcination of nsGa 2 O 3 at higher temperature increases tetracoordinated Ga atmos.This is consistent with the results of XRD measurement. Although Ga K-edge EXAFS spectra of nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) and -Ga 2 O were similar with each other (Fig. 9(a)), derived RSFs from them showed the important difference; the second peak at around 2.7 A attributed to Ga-(O)-Ga bond was lower for nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) than that of -Ga 2 O 3 (See Fig. 9(b)).Using the curve fitting, the coordination number for Ga-(O)-Ga bond was evaluated and given in Table 2.The coordination number in nsGa 2 O 3 is a little smaller than that in -Ga 2 O 3 .Considering that EXAFS provides sub-nm or nm sized local structure, the difference in the coordination number suggests that nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) consisting of -Ga 2 O 3 crystalline structure is a little defective compared to fully crystalized one, owing to its very thin planer structure consisting of nano-particulates. Fig. 10 compares the production rates of H 2 and CO and the selectivity toward CO evolution observed for three tested samples in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction using aqueous solution with methanol.H 2 and CO were continuously evolved throughout the reaction tests for both samples.CO production rate of Ag/nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) was over 2 times higher than that of Ag/-Ga 2 O 3 , while H 2 production rate was lower.Consequently, CO selectivity (the ratio of CO production amount to total amounts of reduction products) of Ag/nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) reached 70.nsGa 2 O 3 (1023 K) showed a little less activity than that for nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K), probably because its crystallinity was less than that of the latter.Hence the discussion was focused to comparison of Ag/ nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) and Ag/-Ga 2 O 3. Since CO could be evolved from methanol or NaHCO 3, the reduction test without CO 2 flow was conducted.As shown in Fig. 11, the CO production rate without CO 2 flow was only 1.5-3.4mol/h.Furthermore, no CO production was observed without Ag/nsGa 2 O 3 .Therefore, it is confirmed that most of the generated CO was derived from the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction and nsGa 2 O 3 prepared by the present method was suitable for CO 2 reduction rather than H 2 production from water compared to -Ga 2 O 3 used here. It was found that nsGa 2 O 3 (sheet-like nanometer-sized particulate Ga 2 O 3 ) exhibiting well crystallized -phase gave better performance in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction than that given by -Ga 2 O 3 .The improvement is, in some sense, a corollary of ultrafine particulation, as appeared in the increase of SSA.Still nsGa 2 O 3 exhibits different characters relating photocatalytic activity compared with those of -Ga 2 O 3 .They are CO 2 absorption capability and states of Ag cocatalyst on them. To reveal the adsorbed species on nsGa 2 O 3 and -Ga 2 O 3 as prepared, in-situ FT-IR measurements were conducted.Fig. 12 shows FT-IR spectra in wavelength range 2600-3800 cm -1 , which represent adsorbed water or hydroxyl groups on nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) and -Ga 2 O 3 .The larger peak intensity for nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) than -Ga 2 O 3 well corresponds to the larger SSA of the former.Since nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) exhibiting -Ga 2 O phase was a little defective compared to fully crystalized one, included defects in nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) likely contribute to provide adsorption sites for hydroxyl groups.To make detailed comparison on adsorbed hydroxyl groups on both samples, the two FT-IR spectra are compared by normalizing with their peak intensity at 3463 cm -1 as the inset of Fig. 12.Two peaks at 3720 and 3653 cm -1 are appreciable, which are assigned to the stretching vibration of single and bridge bonded hydroxyl groups, respectively 27.The larger intensity of these peaks for nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) than -Ga 2 O 3 indicates that the former adsorbed more hydroxyl groups compared to the latter.Fig. 13 shows the difference FT-IR spectra of the adsorbed species on nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) and -Ga 2 O 3 after introduction of 45 Torr of CO 2 .The absorption bands at 1635 and 1420 cm -1 are assigned to asymmetric CO 3 stretching vibration as (CO 3 ) and symmetric CO 3 stretching vibration s (CO 3 ) of monodentate bicarbonate species, respectively 28293031, while the bands at 1590 and 1320 cm -1 are attributed to as (CO 3 ) and s (CO 3 ) of bidentate carbonate species, respectively 282930.CO 2 molecules would react with the surface hydroxyl groups and the surface lattice oxygen of Ga 2 O 3 to form the monodentate bicarbonate species and bidentate carbonate species 32,33.The former is assigned to be an intermediated state for CO production over Ga 2 O 34.The significant increases of monodentate bicarbonate species on nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) compared to those on -Ga 2 O 3 could be one of the causes for the higher CO production on nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K). Fig. 14 shows UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra of nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) and -Ga 2 O 3 with comparison of Ag/nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) and Ag/-Ga 2 O after use for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction test.Before the Ag loading, the absorption derived from the bandgap transition of Ga 2 O appeared at 290 nm in both samples (Fig. 14a).As for Ag/ nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) and Ag/-Ga 2 O 3 after use (Fig. 14b), an absorption peak around 430 nm attributed to localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of small Ag nanoparticle (Ag NPs) was observed 33.It should be mentioned that without methanol addition, Ag-NPs on nsGa 2 O 3 were not stable and the absorption peak around 430 nm were broadened and/ or decreased, accompanying the activity loss.Recently, we have found the nearly linear relationship of the LSPR intensity (i.e., the number density of small Ag NPs) and the CO production rate and concluded that Ag NPs showing the LSPR absorption peak are active sites for the CO reduction 17.Since the LSPR peaks were sharp and more intense in The size distributions are given in Fig. 16.Thus ultrafine particulation of Ga 2 O 3 seems to stabilize AgNPs to be ca.20 nm or less, the suitable size as Ag cocatalyst by avoiding their aggregation. We have succeeded in synthesizing sheet-like Ga 2 O 3 (nsGa 2 O 3 ) with using GO as a template by loading Ga 2 O 3 precursor on GO followed by GO removal by calcination at higher temperatures.The synthesized nsGa 2 O 3 consists of the planner aggregation of the nanometer-sized Ga 2 O 3 particles which are much smaller than those of Ga 2 O 3 synthesized by a simple calcination such as commercially available -Ga 2 O 3 and other synthesized Ga 2 O 3 samples in our previous work 5.Accordingly, the specific surface area (SSA) of nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) was much larger than that of -Ga 2 O 3 .The crystallinity and crystalline phase of nsGa 2 O 3 were changed with the calcination temperature.Among all synthesized nsGa 2 O 3 samples, nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) which was consisted of the only -phase showed the highest CO production rate and CO selectivity in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with water including NaHCO 3 and methanol. Thus, we can conclude that nsGa 2 O 3 (sheet-like nanometer-sized particulate Ga 2 O 3 ) exhibiting well crystalized -phase gives better performance in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.At the present stage, it is difficult to mention the particular cause for the improvement.Observed changes in characters relating the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction are the increase of SSA, larger CO 2 adsorption ability and the loading state of Ag co-catalyst.Those are in some sense a corollary of ultrafine particulation.Still the crystalline phase and crystallite size of nsGa 2 O 3 were not fully controlled, it remains as a future work to optimize them for further improvement of the activity of nsGa 2 O 3 for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.

This work was supported continuously by Prof. Takenaka, Mr. Sugiyama and Mr. Suzuki of Doshisya University in the preparation of Ga 2 O 3 nano-sheets.Synchrotron experiments were carried out at Aichi Synchrotron Radiation Center and UVSOR Institute for Molecular Science which are supported by No. 2503042 and 2019-510, respectively.This work was supported by Kansai Research Foundation for Technology Promotion.", "vote": "1"}], "reaction medium": [{"llm generation": "Liquid", "source": "Furthermore, Ag loaded nsGa 2 O 3 calcined at 1123 K (Ag/nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K)) showed very high photocatalytic activity for CO production in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction test in water including methanol under UV light irradiation.", "context": "Since the activity of semiconductor photocatalysts for CO 2 reduction with water is still low, it is necessary to improve their activity.To do this, the optimization of particle size and crystal structure of the photocatalysts is one of the promising ways.In previous studies, we have reported that micro-particulate Ga 2 O 3 deposited on Al 2 O 3 support significantly improves the photocatalytic activity of CO 2 reduction.However, it is quite difficult to synthesize nano-particulate Ga 2 O 3 with high crystallinity by calcination at higher temperatures.In this work, we have tried to synthesize sheet-like nano-particulate Ga 2 O 3 using graphene oxide (GO) as a template for the first time.After loading gallium butoxide on GO, it was calcined to oxidize the gallium butoxide into Ga 2 O 3 and also to remove GO.Various spectroscopic analyses revealed that the synthesized materials were planar aggregation of nanometer-sized Ga 2 O 3 particles (nsGa 2 O 3 ), of which sizes and crystallinity could be controlled with the calcination temperature.The nsGa 2 O 3 calcined at 1123 K was well crystallized and showed -phase with a quite large specific surface area.Furthermore, Ag loaded nsGa 2 O 3 calcined at 1123 K (Ag/nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K)) showed very high photocatalytic activity for CO production in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction test in water including methanol under UV light irradiation.Thus, it is confirmed that the planar aggregation of nanometer-sized Ga 2 O 3 significantly improves the photocatalytic activity of Ga 2 O 3 on the CO 2 reduction.", "vote": "0"}, {"llm generation": "Liquid", "source": "50 mg of the sample was dispersed in the aqueous solution of 10 mL of NaHCO 3 (1 M) and 2 mL of methanol.", "context": "Fig. 1 schematically shows synthesis processes, in which the results of characterizations given in the following sections were included.500 mg of dried GO which was obtained by the exfoliation of the graphitic oxide 19,20 following the Hummer's method 21 and 1.53 g of Ga (OnC 4 H 9 ) 3 (referred to as Ga(OBu) 3 ) were suspended in 500 mL of cyclohexane (super dehydrated, Wako Pure Chemicals).The suspension was stirred at room temperature (RT) for several days in order to disperse dried GO in cyclohexane homogeneously and to load Ga(OBu) 3 on the dried GO.Above processes were carried out in a nitrogen purged glove box because Ga(OBu) 3 is highly deliquescent.The obtained material is denoted as Ga(OBu) 3 /GO.Ga(OBu) 3 /GO was dispersed in 540 mL of cyclohexane and transferred to Teflon containers in a stainlesssteel autoclave.Then the autoclave was heated at 453 K for 6 h.During the heating, Ga(OBu) 3 was mostly oxidized to be GaO x and GO was partly reduced and referred to as rGO.Then, the resultant material was centrifuged and dried in a vacuum overnight to get GaO x /rGO.Finally, GaO x /rGO was calcined in air at a temperature ranging from 823 to 1123 K for 2 h (temperature raising rate: 2 C/min) to get sheet-like nsGa 2 O 3 (denoted as nsGa 2 O 3 (X K), where X indicates the calcination temperature). Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction tests were conducted using nsGa 2 O 3 with Ag loading as a co-catalyst.Commercially available -Ga 2 O 3 (Kojundo Chemical Laboratory Co., Ltd., Purity 99.99, denoted as -Ga 2 O 3 ) was also tested for the comparison.The 0.5 wt Ag co-catalyst was loaded by a photodeposition method with using AgNO 3 (Kishida Chemical Co., Ltd., Purity 99.8) as a precursor.However, the loaded Ag co-catalyst on nsGa 2 O 3 was unstable in water under UV light irradiation to be oxidized or reduced to large metallic particles, resulting in the loss of catalytic activity.Recently we have succeeded to control and stabilize the size and distribution of Ag nanoparticles (Ag NPs) on Ga 2 O photocatalysts with using aqueous solution of methanol 17.Therefore, the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction tests were conducted using the aqueous solution of methanol with the optimized concentration of vol, which made Ag-NPs stable during the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction tests and gave reproducible results to compare the photocatalytic activities of synthesized nsGa 2 O 3 with that of -Ga 2 O 3 . Three samples thus prepared were subjected to photocatalytic CO reduction tests; two samples consisting of the phase (nsGa 2 O 3 (1023 K) and ns Ga 2 O 3 (1123 K)), and -Ga 2 O 3 with Ag loaded as a co-catalyst.The loaded amounts were determined as 0.24, 0.39 and 0.33 wt, respectively from X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy measurement .Three samples are referred to as Ag/nsGa 2 O 3 (1023 K), Ag/nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) and Ag/-Ga 2 O 3 ) hereafter. The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction tests were carried out in a fixedbed flow reactor cell.50 mg of the sample was dispersed in the aqueous solution of 10 mL of NaHCO 3 (1 M) and 2 mL of methanol.The air in the cell was replaced with CO 2 gas with the flow rate of 50 mL/min for 30 min.Then, the tests were conducted with UV irradiation under the CO 2 gas with the flow rate of 3.0 mL/min.A 300 W Xe lamp was used as the UV source and its light intensity was about 25 mW/cm 2 in the wavelength range of 254 10 nm.The reaction products (mainly CO and H 2 ) were analyzed by a gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector.Without the CO 2 flow in the reaction cell, the amount of produced CO was very small.This confirms that methanol hardly influenced the CO 2 reduction in the present experiments as already found in previous works 17,18. For understanding of the formation process of nsGa 2 O 3 , thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted with a Thermo plus EVO2 (Rigaku) using a Pt pan sample holder in air, with a heating rate of 5 K/ min.Characterization of samples was performed by a transmission electron microscope (TEM), a scanning electron microscope (SEM), Xray diffraction (XRD), X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) and UV-Vis diffuse reflectance (UV-Vis DR).Specific surface area (SSA) was also measured. TEM images of the samples were acquired with JEM-2100F, operating at 200 kV.SEM images of the samples were acquired with JSM-6500F, operating at 15 kV.XRD patterns of the samples were recorded on a MiniFlex600 (Rigaku) using Cu K as a radiation source with an operating voltage of 40 kV and current of 15 mA.The XRD patterns were collected at 2 angles of 10-80 .The 2 step size was 0.02 , and the scanning rate was 5 /min.Ga K-edge XAFS spectra of nsGa 2 O 3 were measured at the beamline 5S1 in Aichi Synchrotron Radiation Center using a Si(1 1 1) double-crystal monochromator at RT.The data were recorded in a transmission mode.Ga L 3 -edge XAFS spectra were recorded in a fluorescence yield mode at beamline 2A in UVSOR, Institute for Molecular Science, using beryl double-crystal monochromator at RT. SSA of the samples were determined by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) SSA measurements at 77 K (liquid N 2 temperature) using Monosorb (Quantachrome).Before the BET measurements, the samples were heated at 573 K for 3 h in N 2 atmosphere as a pretreatment.The adsorbed amounts of CO 2 on nsGa 2 O 3 samples and their chemical states were investigated by in-situ FT-IR measurements using FT/IR-6100 (JASCO) in the transmission mode at RT.The sample (ca.15 mg) was pressed into a disk (diameter: 10 mm) at 50 MPa and placed in an in-situ IR cell equipped with CaF 2 window.The cell allowed us in-situ measurements as well as sample heating, introduction of the reactant gas and UV light irradiation.Before the in-situ measurement, the sample was pretreated with evacuation at RT for 3 h.UV-Vis DR spectra were measured at RT using a spectrometer (JASCO V-670).The spectrum of Ba 2 SO 4 was used as the reference.The concentration of loaded Ag on Ga 2 O 3 was determined by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) measurement using with EDX-720 (Shimadzu) whose primary X-ray source is Rh. As mentioned in the experimental section, GO was partly reduced and GaO x /rGO was produced during the heat treatment at 453 K in the autoclave.The following calcination of GaO x /rGO at higher temperature resulted in the planar aggregates of nsGa 2 O 3 by removing rGO and full oxidation of GaO x .In order to understand the above process, TGA was done both for GO and GaO x /rGO in the temperatures ranging from to 900 K.The results were given in Fig. 2. The weight losses of GO appeared at around 320 K and 500 K were caused by water desorption and oxidative evaporation of functional groups such as -OH and -COOH in GO, respectively 21.The full combustion of carbon started at around 800 K and completed at 900 K.In the TGA profile of GaO x / rGO, the gradual loss continued until the final full combustion.Since no clear loss corresponding to the evaporation of the functional groups was observed, GO must be mildly reduced during the autoclave treatment.That is the reason for using the terminology of rGO.Even if there was the evaporation of the functional groups, the weight gain caused by the oxidation of GaOx could hinder the evaporation loss.After the full combustion at around 900 K only Ga 2 O 3 remained.From the weight of the remained Ga 2 O 3 , we have determined the loading amount of Ga 2 O in the GaO x /rGO to be 25 wt which included some uncertainty caused by the full oxidation of GaOx to Ga 2 O 3 . Fig. 3 shows SEM images of GaO x /rGO, and Fig. 4 shows TEM images of GO and GaO x /rGO.The SEM images clearly show that GaO x /rGO is consisting of petal-like sheets with their width of around a few m.Each sheet of GaO x /rGO is transparent in the TEM image.The sheet seems homogenous and a little thicker than GO sheet except some segregation of GaO x which is appreciable as local black colored areas.The existence of GaO x on rGO was confirmed by the appearance of amorphous like patterns in XRD (See Fig. 7(a)).In EXAFS analysis, the existence of GaO x was also confirmed, and the bonding or coordination of a gallium atom to the first and second neighboring ones were depicted as described below. In Fig. 1 is indicated how nsGa 2 O 3 synthesis proceeded according to the obtained results.(Fig. 5(a,b)), respectively.As for RSFs, the first peak around 1-2 A was assigned to the backscattering from adjacent atoms to a gallium atom, corresponding to Ga-O bond for both -Ga 2 O 3 and GaO x /rGO.Although the second peak around 2.5-3 A appeared in the RSF of GaO x /rGO (Fig. 5(c)) seems well corresponding to the second-neighboring Ga atoms (Ga-(O)-Ga) appeared in the RSF of -Ga 2 O 3 (Fig. 5(d)) 222324, the curve-fitting analysis of GaO x /rGO suggests that the second peak is caused by Ga-O and Ga-C bonds having longer interatomic distances than first neighboring Ga-O bond.The appearance of these longer Ga-O and Ga-C bonds is likely caused by the junction between GaO x species and rGO in atomic scales.The absence of Ga-(O)-Ga bond also suggests GaO x species on rGO were highly dispersed rather than aggregated. Fig. 6 compares TEM images of nsGa 2 O 3 (823-1123 K) and -Ga 2 O 3 .The images clearly indicate the difference in the morphology among synthesized nsGa 2 O 3 and -Ga 2 O 3 .It should be noted that two dimensional structure of the GaO x /rGO was maintained after the removal of the rGO.Thus, sheet-like materials consisting of nano-sized polycrystalline were successfully synthesized by the present method.Although the average size of polycrystalline became larger with increasing the calcination temperature, planar aggregate structures made of nano-particulates were maintained even for nsGa 2 O 3 calcined at such high temperature as 1123 K (sample nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K)). Table 1 shows the results of BET SSA measurements for nsGa 2 O 3 (823-1123 K) and -Ga 2 O 3 .It should be noted that SSA of nsGa 2 O 3 (823-1123 K) are larger than that of -Ga 2 O 3 about 18, 11, 9.8 and 6.5 times, respectively. In Fig. 7, XRD patterns of GaO x /rGO, nsGa 2 O 3 (823-1123 K) and -Ga 2 O 3 were compared.The XRD pattern of GaO x /rGO spreads widely with low intensity, including a broad peak assigned to (0 0 2) plane of graphite (Fig. 7(a)) 25.This indicates that very thin amorphous like GaO x or highly dispersed small GaO x particles were loaded on rGO.As the calcination temperature increased, the crystallinity of nsGa 2 O samples was improved.The higher the crystallinity of nsGa 2 O 3 became, the smaller SSA was.The XRD patterns of nsGa 2 O 3 (823, 923 K) were consisting of the mixed diffraction patterns of -Ga 2 O 3 and -Ga 2 O 3 , while those of nsGa 2 O 3 (1023, 1123 K) were assigned to the single phase of -Ga 2 O 3 .Thus, after removing rGO from GaO x /rGO by calcination, GaO x turned to be aggregation of nano-sized particles, which maintained the sheet like form and consisted of mixed phases of and by calcination at 823-923 K.The calcination above 1023 K made all particles to the single phase of -Ga 2 O 3 . The crystallite size was calculated from the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the most intense diffraction peak using the Scherrer's equation as shown in Table 1.Since the crystallite sizes derived from the Scherrer's equation was consistent with that observed in the TEM images in Fig. 6(b),(d),(f) and (h), it can be concluded that nsGa 2 O 3 were formed by crystallization of amorphous like Ga 2 O 3 sheet and aggregation of the crystallized nano-particles with keeping the sheet like form.Fig. 8 compares Ga L 3 -edge XANES spectra of single phases of , and in (a) with those of nsGa 2 O 3 in (b).It is known that Ga L 3 -edge XAFS analysis gives more detailed information on the local symmetry structures of nsGa 2 O 3 compared with Ga K-edge XAFS analysis 14,26.As seen in Fig. 8 (a), the intensities of the peak around 1107 eV decreases in the order of -Ga 2 O 3 , -Ga 2 O 3 and -Ga 2 O 3 .The main difference among these three phases is number density of hexacoordinated Ga atoms structure; the highest one is -Ga 2 O 3 in which all Ga atoms are hexacoordinated, the second, -Ga 2 O 3 including some tetracoordinated Ga atoms, and the least, -Ga 2 O 3 consisting of hexacoordinated Ga and tetracoordinated Ga atoms evenly. As shown in Fig. 8(b), the peak intensity around 1107 eV of the Ga L 3 -edge XANES spectra of nsGa 2 O 3 decreased with increasing the calcination temperature.This indicates that nsGa 2 O 3 calcined at lower temperature were mainly composed of hexacoordinated Ga atoms, while the calcination of nsGa 2 O 3 at higher temperature increases tetracoordinated Ga atmos.This is consistent with the results of XRD measurement. Although Ga K-edge EXAFS spectra of nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) and -Ga 2 O were similar with each other (Fig. 9(a)), derived RSFs from them showed the important difference; the second peak at around 2.7 A attributed to Ga-(O)-Ga bond was lower for nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) than that of -Ga 2 O 3 (See Fig. 9(b)).Using the curve fitting, the coordination number for Ga-(O)-Ga bond was evaluated and given in Table 2.The coordination number in nsGa 2 O 3 is a little smaller than that in -Ga 2 O 3 .Considering that EXAFS provides sub-nm or nm sized local structure, the difference in the coordination number suggests that nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) consisting of -Ga 2 O 3 crystalline structure is a little defective compared to fully crystalized one, owing to its very thin planer structure consisting of nano-particulates. Fig. 10 compares the production rates of H 2 and CO and the selectivity toward CO evolution observed for three tested samples in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction using aqueous solution with methanol.H 2 and CO were continuously evolved throughout the reaction tests for both samples.CO production rate of Ag/nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) was over 2 times higher than that of Ag/-Ga 2 O 3 , while H 2 production rate was lower.Consequently, CO selectivity (the ratio of CO production amount to total amounts of reduction products) of Ag/nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) reached 70.nsGa 2 O 3 (1023 K) showed a little less activity than that for nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K), probably because its crystallinity was less than that of the latter.Hence the discussion was focused to comparison of Ag/ nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) and Ag/-Ga 2 O 3. Since CO could be evolved from methanol or NaHCO 3, the reduction test without CO 2 flow was conducted.As shown in Fig. 11, the CO production rate without CO 2 flow was only 1.5-3.4mol/h.Furthermore, no CO production was observed without Ag/nsGa 2 O 3 .Therefore, it is confirmed that most of the generated CO was derived from the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction and nsGa 2 O 3 prepared by the present method was suitable for CO 2 reduction rather than H 2 production from water compared to -Ga 2 O 3 used here. It was found that nsGa 2 O 3 (sheet-like nanometer-sized particulate Ga 2 O 3 ) exhibiting well crystallized -phase gave better performance in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction than that given by -Ga 2 O 3 .The improvement is, in some sense, a corollary of ultrafine particulation, as appeared in the increase of SSA.Still nsGa 2 O 3 exhibits different characters relating photocatalytic activity compared with those of -Ga 2 O 3 .They are CO 2 absorption capability and states of Ag cocatalyst on them. To reveal the adsorbed species on nsGa 2 O 3 and -Ga 2 O 3 as prepared, in-situ FT-IR measurements were conducted.Fig. 12 shows FT-IR spectra in wavelength range 2600-3800 cm -1 , which represent adsorbed water or hydroxyl groups on nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) and -Ga 2 O 3 .The larger peak intensity for nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) than -Ga 2 O 3 well corresponds to the larger SSA of the former.Since nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) exhibiting -Ga 2 O phase was a little defective compared to fully crystalized one, included defects in nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) likely contribute to provide adsorption sites for hydroxyl groups.To make detailed comparison on adsorbed hydroxyl groups on both samples, the two FT-IR spectra are compared by normalizing with their peak intensity at 3463 cm -1 as the inset of Fig. 12.Two peaks at 3720 and 3653 cm -1 are appreciable, which are assigned to the stretching vibration of single and bridge bonded hydroxyl groups, respectively 27.The larger intensity of these peaks for nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) than -Ga 2 O 3 indicates that the former adsorbed more hydroxyl groups compared to the latter.Fig. 13 shows the difference FT-IR spectra of the adsorbed species on nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) and -Ga 2 O 3 after introduction of 45 Torr of CO 2 .The absorption bands at 1635 and 1420 cm -1 are assigned to asymmetric CO 3 stretching vibration as (CO 3 ) and symmetric CO 3 stretching vibration s (CO 3 ) of monodentate bicarbonate species, respectively 28293031, while the bands at 1590 and 1320 cm -1 are attributed to as (CO 3 ) and s (CO 3 ) of bidentate carbonate species, respectively 282930.CO 2 molecules would react with the surface hydroxyl groups and the surface lattice oxygen of Ga 2 O 3 to form the monodentate bicarbonate species and bidentate carbonate species 32,33.The former is assigned to be an intermediated state for CO production over Ga 2 O 34.The significant increases of monodentate bicarbonate species on nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) compared to those on -Ga 2 O 3 could be one of the causes for the higher CO production on nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K). Fig. 14 shows UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra of nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) and -Ga 2 O 3 with comparison of Ag/nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) and Ag/-Ga 2 O after use for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction test.Before the Ag loading, the absorption derived from the bandgap transition of Ga 2 O appeared at 290 nm in both samples (Fig. 14a).As for Ag/ nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) and Ag/-Ga 2 O 3 after use (Fig. 14b), an absorption peak around 430 nm attributed to localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of small Ag nanoparticle (Ag NPs) was observed 33.It should be mentioned that without methanol addition, Ag-NPs on nsGa 2 O 3 were not stable and the absorption peak around 430 nm were broadened and/ or decreased, accompanying the activity loss.Recently, we have found the nearly linear relationship of the LSPR intensity (i.e., the number density of small Ag NPs) and the CO production rate and concluded that Ag NPs showing the LSPR absorption peak are active sites for the CO reduction 17.Since the LSPR peaks were sharp and more intense in The size distributions are given in Fig. 16.Thus ultrafine particulation of Ga 2 O 3 seems to stabilize AgNPs to be ca.20 nm or less, the suitable size as Ag cocatalyst by avoiding their aggregation. We have succeeded in synthesizing sheet-like Ga 2 O 3 (nsGa 2 O 3 ) with using GO as a template by loading Ga 2 O 3 precursor on GO followed by GO removal by calcination at higher temperatures.The synthesized nsGa 2 O 3 consists of the planner aggregation of the nanometer-sized Ga 2 O 3 particles which are much smaller than those of Ga 2 O 3 synthesized by a simple calcination such as commercially available -Ga 2 O 3 and other synthesized Ga 2 O 3 samples in our previous work 5.Accordingly, the specific surface area (SSA) of nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) was much larger than that of -Ga 2 O 3 .The crystallinity and crystalline phase of nsGa 2 O 3 were changed with the calcination temperature.Among all synthesized nsGa 2 O 3 samples, nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) which was consisted of the only -phase showed the highest CO production rate and CO selectivity in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with water including NaHCO 3 and methanol. Thus, we can conclude that nsGa 2 O 3 (sheet-like nanometer-sized particulate Ga 2 O 3 ) exhibiting well crystalized -phase gives better performance in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.At the present stage, it is difficult to mention the particular cause for the improvement.Observed changes in characters relating the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction are the increase of SSA, larger CO 2 adsorption ability and the loading state of Ag co-catalyst.Those are in some sense a corollary of ultrafine particulation.Still the crystalline phase and crystallite size of nsGa 2 O 3 were not fully controlled, it remains as a future work to optimize them for further improvement of the activity of nsGa 2 O 3 for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.

This work was supported continuously by Prof. Takenaka, Mr. Sugiyama and Mr. Suzuki of Doshisya University in the preparation of Ga 2 O 3 nano-sheets.Synchrotron experiments were carried out at Aichi Synchrotron Radiation Center and UVSOR Institute for Molecular Science which are supported by No. 2503042 and 2019-510, respectively.This work was supported by Kansai Research Foundation for Technology Promotion.", "vote": "0"}], "reactor type": [{"llm generation": "Fixed-bed", "source": "The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction tests were carried out in a fixedbed flow reactor cell.", "context": "Fig. 1 schematically shows synthesis processes, in which the results of characterizations given in the following sections were included.500 mg of dried GO which was obtained by the exfoliation of the graphitic oxide 19,20 following the Hummer's method 21 and 1.53 g of Ga (OnC 4 H 9 ) 3 (referred to as Ga(OBu) 3 ) were suspended in 500 mL of cyclohexane (super dehydrated, Wako Pure Chemicals).The suspension was stirred at room temperature (RT) for several days in order to disperse dried GO in cyclohexane homogeneously and to load Ga(OBu) 3 on the dried GO.Above processes were carried out in a nitrogen purged glove box because Ga(OBu) 3 is highly deliquescent.The obtained material is denoted as Ga(OBu) 3 /GO.Ga(OBu) 3 /GO was dispersed in 540 mL of cyclohexane and transferred to Teflon containers in a stainlesssteel autoclave.Then the autoclave was heated at 453 K for 6 h.During the heating, Ga(OBu) 3 was mostly oxidized to be GaO x and GO was partly reduced and referred to as rGO.Then, the resultant material was centrifuged and dried in a vacuum overnight to get GaO x /rGO.Finally, GaO x /rGO was calcined in air at a temperature ranging from 823 to 1123 K for 2 h (temperature raising rate: 2 C/min) to get sheet-like nsGa 2 O 3 (denoted as nsGa 2 O 3 (X K), where X indicates the calcination temperature). Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction tests were conducted using nsGa 2 O 3 with Ag loading as a co-catalyst.Commercially available -Ga 2 O 3 (Kojundo Chemical Laboratory Co., Ltd., Purity 99.99, denoted as -Ga 2 O 3 ) was also tested for the comparison.The 0.5 wt Ag co-catalyst was loaded by a photodeposition method with using AgNO 3 (Kishida Chemical Co., Ltd., Purity 99.8) as a precursor.However, the loaded Ag co-catalyst on nsGa 2 O 3 was unstable in water under UV light irradiation to be oxidized or reduced to large metallic particles, resulting in the loss of catalytic activity.Recently we have succeeded to control and stabilize the size and distribution of Ag nanoparticles (Ag NPs) on Ga 2 O photocatalysts with using aqueous solution of methanol 17.Therefore, the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction tests were conducted using the aqueous solution of methanol with the optimized concentration of vol, which made Ag-NPs stable during the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction tests and gave reproducible results to compare the photocatalytic activities of synthesized nsGa 2 O 3 with that of -Ga 2 O 3 . Three samples thus prepared were subjected to photocatalytic CO reduction tests; two samples consisting of the phase (nsGa 2 O 3 (1023 K) and ns Ga 2 O 3 (1123 K)), and -Ga 2 O 3 with Ag loaded as a co-catalyst.The loaded amounts were determined as 0.24, 0.39 and 0.33 wt, respectively from X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy measurement .Three samples are referred to as Ag/nsGa 2 O 3 (1023 K), Ag/nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) and Ag/-Ga 2 O 3 ) hereafter. The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction tests were carried out in a fixedbed flow reactor cell.50 mg of the sample was dispersed in the aqueous solution of 10 mL of NaHCO 3 (1 M) and 2 mL of methanol.The air in the cell was replaced with CO 2 gas with the flow rate of 50 mL/min for 30 min.Then, the tests were conducted with UV irradiation under the CO 2 gas with the flow rate of 3.0 mL/min.A 300 W Xe lamp was used as the UV source and its light intensity was about 25 mW/cm 2 in the wavelength range of 254 10 nm.The reaction products (mainly CO and H 2 ) were analyzed by a gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector.Without the CO 2 flow in the reaction cell, the amount of produced CO was very small.This confirms that methanol hardly influenced the CO 2 reduction in the present experiments as already found in previous works 17,18. For understanding of the formation process of nsGa 2 O 3 , thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted with a Thermo plus EVO2 (Rigaku) using a Pt pan sample holder in air, with a heating rate of 5 K/ min.Characterization of samples was performed by a transmission electron microscope (TEM), a scanning electron microscope (SEM), Xray diffraction (XRD), X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) and UV-Vis diffuse reflectance (UV-Vis DR).Specific surface area (SSA) was also measured. TEM images of the samples were acquired with JEM-2100F, operating at 200 kV.SEM images of the samples were acquired with JSM-6500F, operating at 15 kV.XRD patterns of the samples were recorded on a MiniFlex600 (Rigaku) using Cu K as a radiation source with an operating voltage of 40 kV and current of 15 mA.The XRD patterns were collected at 2 angles of 10-80 .The 2 step size was 0.02 , and the scanning rate was 5 /min.Ga K-edge XAFS spectra of nsGa 2 O 3 were measured at the beamline 5S1 in Aichi Synchrotron Radiation Center using a Si(1 1 1) double-crystal monochromator at RT.The data were recorded in a transmission mode.Ga L 3 -edge XAFS spectra were recorded in a fluorescence yield mode at beamline 2A in UVSOR, Institute for Molecular Science, using beryl double-crystal monochromator at RT. SSA of the samples were determined by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) SSA measurements at 77 K (liquid N 2 temperature) using Monosorb (Quantachrome).Before the BET measurements, the samples were heated at 573 K for 3 h in N 2 atmosphere as a pretreatment.The adsorbed amounts of CO 2 on nsGa 2 O 3 samples and their chemical states were investigated by in-situ FT-IR measurements using FT/IR-6100 (JASCO) in the transmission mode at RT.The sample (ca.15 mg) was pressed into a disk (diameter: 10 mm) at 50 MPa and placed in an in-situ IR cell equipped with CaF 2 window.The cell allowed us in-situ measurements as well as sample heating, introduction of the reactant gas and UV light irradiation.Before the in-situ measurement, the sample was pretreated with evacuation at RT for 3 h.UV-Vis DR spectra were measured at RT using a spectrometer (JASCO V-670).The spectrum of Ba 2 SO 4 was used as the reference.The concentration of loaded Ag on Ga 2 O 3 was determined by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) measurement using with EDX-720 (Shimadzu) whose primary X-ray source is Rh. As mentioned in the experimental section, GO was partly reduced and GaO x /rGO was produced during the heat treatment at 453 K in the autoclave.The following calcination of GaO x /rGO at higher temperature resulted in the planar aggregates of nsGa 2 O 3 by removing rGO and full oxidation of GaO x .In order to understand the above process, TGA was done both for GO and GaO x /rGO in the temperatures ranging from to 900 K.The results were given in Fig. 2. The weight losses of GO appeared at around 320 K and 500 K were caused by water desorption and oxidative evaporation of functional groups such as -OH and -COOH in GO, respectively 21.The full combustion of carbon started at around 800 K and completed at 900 K.In the TGA profile of GaO x / rGO, the gradual loss continued until the final full combustion.Since no clear loss corresponding to the evaporation of the functional groups was observed, GO must be mildly reduced during the autoclave treatment.That is the reason for using the terminology of rGO.Even if there was the evaporation of the functional groups, the weight gain caused by the oxidation of GaOx could hinder the evaporation loss.After the full combustion at around 900 K only Ga 2 O 3 remained.From the weight of the remained Ga 2 O 3 , we have determined the loading amount of Ga 2 O in the GaO x /rGO to be 25 wt which included some uncertainty caused by the full oxidation of GaOx to Ga 2 O 3 . Fig. 3 shows SEM images of GaO x /rGO, and Fig. 4 shows TEM images of GO and GaO x /rGO.The SEM images clearly show that GaO x /rGO is consisting of petal-like sheets with their width of around a few m.Each sheet of GaO x /rGO is transparent in the TEM image.The sheet seems homogenous and a little thicker than GO sheet except some segregation of GaO x which is appreciable as local black colored areas.The existence of GaO x on rGO was confirmed by the appearance of amorphous like patterns in XRD (See Fig. 7(a)).In EXAFS analysis, the existence of GaO x was also confirmed, and the bonding or coordination of a gallium atom to the first and second neighboring ones were depicted as described below. In Fig. 1 is indicated how nsGa 2 O 3 synthesis proceeded according to the obtained results.(Fig. 5(a,b)), respectively.As for RSFs, the first peak around 1-2 A was assigned to the backscattering from adjacent atoms to a gallium atom, corresponding to Ga-O bond for both -Ga 2 O 3 and GaO x /rGO.Although the second peak around 2.5-3 A appeared in the RSF of GaO x /rGO (Fig. 5(c)) seems well corresponding to the second-neighboring Ga atoms (Ga-(O)-Ga) appeared in the RSF of -Ga 2 O 3 (Fig. 5(d)) 222324, the curve-fitting analysis of GaO x /rGO suggests that the second peak is caused by Ga-O and Ga-C bonds having longer interatomic distances than first neighboring Ga-O bond.The appearance of these longer Ga-O and Ga-C bonds is likely caused by the junction between GaO x species and rGO in atomic scales.The absence of Ga-(O)-Ga bond also suggests GaO x species on rGO were highly dispersed rather than aggregated. Fig. 6 compares TEM images of nsGa 2 O 3 (823-1123 K) and -Ga 2 O 3 .The images clearly indicate the difference in the morphology among synthesized nsGa 2 O 3 and -Ga 2 O 3 .It should be noted that two dimensional structure of the GaO x /rGO was maintained after the removal of the rGO.Thus, sheet-like materials consisting of nano-sized polycrystalline were successfully synthesized by the present method.Although the average size of polycrystalline became larger with increasing the calcination temperature, planar aggregate structures made of nano-particulates were maintained even for nsGa 2 O 3 calcined at such high temperature as 1123 K (sample nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K)). Table 1 shows the results of BET SSA measurements for nsGa 2 O 3 (823-1123 K) and -Ga 2 O 3 .It should be noted that SSA of nsGa 2 O 3 (823-1123 K) are larger than that of -Ga 2 O 3 about 18, 11, 9.8 and 6.5 times, respectively. In Fig. 7, XRD patterns of GaO x /rGO, nsGa 2 O 3 (823-1123 K) and -Ga 2 O 3 were compared.The XRD pattern of GaO x /rGO spreads widely with low intensity, including a broad peak assigned to (0 0 2) plane of graphite (Fig. 7(a)) 25.This indicates that very thin amorphous like GaO x or highly dispersed small GaO x particles were loaded on rGO.As the calcination temperature increased, the crystallinity of nsGa 2 O samples was improved.The higher the crystallinity of nsGa 2 O 3 became, the smaller SSA was.The XRD patterns of nsGa 2 O 3 (823, 923 K) were consisting of the mixed diffraction patterns of -Ga 2 O 3 and -Ga 2 O 3 , while those of nsGa 2 O 3 (1023, 1123 K) were assigned to the single phase of -Ga 2 O 3 .Thus, after removing rGO from GaO x /rGO by calcination, GaO x turned to be aggregation of nano-sized particles, which maintained the sheet like form and consisted of mixed phases of and by calcination at 823-923 K.The calcination above 1023 K made all particles to the single phase of -Ga 2 O 3 . The crystallite size was calculated from the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the most intense diffraction peak using the Scherrer's equation as shown in Table 1.Since the crystallite sizes derived from the Scherrer's equation was consistent with that observed in the TEM images in Fig. 6(b),(d),(f) and (h), it can be concluded that nsGa 2 O 3 were formed by crystallization of amorphous like Ga 2 O 3 sheet and aggregation of the crystallized nano-particles with keeping the sheet like form.Fig. 8 compares Ga L 3 -edge XANES spectra of single phases of , and in (a) with those of nsGa 2 O 3 in (b).It is known that Ga L 3 -edge XAFS analysis gives more detailed information on the local symmetry structures of nsGa 2 O 3 compared with Ga K-edge XAFS analysis 14,26.As seen in Fig. 8 (a), the intensities of the peak around 1107 eV decreases in the order of -Ga 2 O 3 , -Ga 2 O 3 and -Ga 2 O 3 .The main difference among these three phases is number density of hexacoordinated Ga atoms structure; the highest one is -Ga 2 O 3 in which all Ga atoms are hexacoordinated, the second, -Ga 2 O 3 including some tetracoordinated Ga atoms, and the least, -Ga 2 O 3 consisting of hexacoordinated Ga and tetracoordinated Ga atoms evenly. As shown in Fig. 8(b), the peak intensity around 1107 eV of the Ga L 3 -edge XANES spectra of nsGa 2 O 3 decreased with increasing the calcination temperature.This indicates that nsGa 2 O 3 calcined at lower temperature were mainly composed of hexacoordinated Ga atoms, while the calcination of nsGa 2 O 3 at higher temperature increases tetracoordinated Ga atmos.This is consistent with the results of XRD measurement. Although Ga K-edge EXAFS spectra of nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) and -Ga 2 O were similar with each other (Fig. 9(a)), derived RSFs from them showed the important difference; the second peak at around 2.7 A attributed to Ga-(O)-Ga bond was lower for nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) than that of -Ga 2 O 3 (See Fig. 9(b)).Using the curve fitting, the coordination number for Ga-(O)-Ga bond was evaluated and given in Table 2.The coordination number in nsGa 2 O 3 is a little smaller than that in -Ga 2 O 3 .Considering that EXAFS provides sub-nm or nm sized local structure, the difference in the coordination number suggests that nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) consisting of -Ga 2 O 3 crystalline structure is a little defective compared to fully crystalized one, owing to its very thin planer structure consisting of nano-particulates. Fig. 10 compares the production rates of H 2 and CO and the selectivity toward CO evolution observed for three tested samples in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction using aqueous solution with methanol.H 2 and CO were continuously evolved throughout the reaction tests for both samples.CO production rate of Ag/nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) was over 2 times higher than that of Ag/-Ga 2 O 3 , while H 2 production rate was lower.Consequently, CO selectivity (the ratio of CO production amount to total amounts of reduction products) of Ag/nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) reached 70.nsGa 2 O 3 (1023 K) showed a little less activity than that for nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K), probably because its crystallinity was less than that of the latter.Hence the discussion was focused to comparison of Ag/ nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) and Ag/-Ga 2 O 3. Since CO could be evolved from methanol or NaHCO 3, the reduction test without CO 2 flow was conducted.As shown in Fig. 11, the CO production rate without CO 2 flow was only 1.5-3.4mol/h.Furthermore, no CO production was observed without Ag/nsGa 2 O 3 .Therefore, it is confirmed that most of the generated CO was derived from the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction and nsGa 2 O 3 prepared by the present method was suitable for CO 2 reduction rather than H 2 production from water compared to -Ga 2 O 3 used here. It was found that nsGa 2 O 3 (sheet-like nanometer-sized particulate Ga 2 O 3 ) exhibiting well crystallized -phase gave better performance in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction than that given by -Ga 2 O 3 .The improvement is, in some sense, a corollary of ultrafine particulation, as appeared in the increase of SSA.Still nsGa 2 O 3 exhibits different characters relating photocatalytic activity compared with those of -Ga 2 O 3 .They are CO 2 absorption capability and states of Ag cocatalyst on them. To reveal the adsorbed species on nsGa 2 O 3 and -Ga 2 O 3 as prepared, in-situ FT-IR measurements were conducted.Fig. 12 shows FT-IR spectra in wavelength range 2600-3800 cm -1 , which represent adsorbed water or hydroxyl groups on nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) and -Ga 2 O 3 .The larger peak intensity for nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) than -Ga 2 O 3 well corresponds to the larger SSA of the former.Since nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) exhibiting -Ga 2 O phase was a little defective compared to fully crystalized one, included defects in nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) likely contribute to provide adsorption sites for hydroxyl groups.To make detailed comparison on adsorbed hydroxyl groups on both samples, the two FT-IR spectra are compared by normalizing with their peak intensity at 3463 cm -1 as the inset of Fig. 12.Two peaks at 3720 and 3653 cm -1 are appreciable, which are assigned to the stretching vibration of single and bridge bonded hydroxyl groups, respectively 27.The larger intensity of these peaks for nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) than -Ga 2 O 3 indicates that the former adsorbed more hydroxyl groups compared to the latter.Fig. 13 shows the difference FT-IR spectra of the adsorbed species on nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) and -Ga 2 O 3 after introduction of 45 Torr of CO 2 .The absorption bands at 1635 and 1420 cm -1 are assigned to asymmetric CO 3 stretching vibration as (CO 3 ) and symmetric CO 3 stretching vibration s (CO 3 ) of monodentate bicarbonate species, respectively 28293031, while the bands at 1590 and 1320 cm -1 are attributed to as (CO 3 ) and s (CO 3 ) of bidentate carbonate species, respectively 282930.CO 2 molecules would react with the surface hydroxyl groups and the surface lattice oxygen of Ga 2 O 3 to form the monodentate bicarbonate species and bidentate carbonate species 32,33.The former is assigned to be an intermediated state for CO production over Ga 2 O 34.The significant increases of monodentate bicarbonate species on nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) compared to those on -Ga 2 O 3 could be one of the causes for the higher CO production on nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K). Fig. 14 shows UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra of nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) and -Ga 2 O 3 with comparison of Ag/nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) and Ag/-Ga 2 O after use for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction test.Before the Ag loading, the absorption derived from the bandgap transition of Ga 2 O appeared at 290 nm in both samples (Fig. 14a).As for Ag/ nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) and Ag/-Ga 2 O 3 after use (Fig. 14b), an absorption peak around 430 nm attributed to localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of small Ag nanoparticle (Ag NPs) was observed 33.It should be mentioned that without methanol addition, Ag-NPs on nsGa 2 O 3 were not stable and the absorption peak around 430 nm were broadened and/ or decreased, accompanying the activity loss.Recently, we have found the nearly linear relationship of the LSPR intensity (i.e., the number density of small Ag NPs) and the CO production rate and concluded that Ag NPs showing the LSPR absorption peak are active sites for the CO reduction 17.Since the LSPR peaks were sharp and more intense in The size distributions are given in Fig. 16.Thus ultrafine particulation of Ga 2 O 3 seems to stabilize AgNPs to be ca.20 nm or less, the suitable size as Ag cocatalyst by avoiding their aggregation. We have succeeded in synthesizing sheet-like Ga 2 O 3 (nsGa 2 O 3 ) with using GO as a template by loading Ga 2 O 3 precursor on GO followed by GO removal by calcination at higher temperatures.The synthesized nsGa 2 O 3 consists of the planner aggregation of the nanometer-sized Ga 2 O 3 particles which are much smaller than those of Ga 2 O 3 synthesized by a simple calcination such as commercially available -Ga 2 O 3 and other synthesized Ga 2 O 3 samples in our previous work 5.Accordingly, the specific surface area (SSA) of nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) was much larger than that of -Ga 2 O 3 .The crystallinity and crystalline phase of nsGa 2 O 3 were changed with the calcination temperature.Among all synthesized nsGa 2 O 3 samples, nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) which was consisted of the only -phase showed the highest CO production rate and CO selectivity in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with water including NaHCO 3 and methanol. Thus, we can conclude that nsGa 2 O 3 (sheet-like nanometer-sized particulate Ga 2 O 3 ) exhibiting well crystalized -phase gives better performance in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.At the present stage, it is difficult to mention the particular cause for the improvement.Observed changes in characters relating the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction are the increase of SSA, larger CO 2 adsorption ability and the loading state of Ag co-catalyst.Those are in some sense a corollary of ultrafine particulation.Still the crystalline phase and crystallite size of nsGa 2 O 3 were not fully controlled, it remains as a future work to optimize them for further improvement of the activity of nsGa 2 O 3 for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.

This work was supported continuously by Prof. Takenaka, Mr. Sugiyama and Mr. Suzuki of Doshisya University in the preparation of Ga 2 O 3 nano-sheets.Synchrotron experiments were carried out at Aichi Synchrotron Radiation Center and UVSOR Institute for Molecular Science which are supported by No. 2503042 and 2019-510, respectively.This work was supported by Kansai Research Foundation for Technology Promotion.", "vote": "1"}], "operation mode": [{"llm generation": "Continuous", "source": "H 2 and CO were continuously evolved throughout the reaction tests for both samples.", "context": "Fig. 1 schematically shows synthesis processes, in which the results of characterizations given in the following sections were included.500 mg of dried GO which was obtained by the exfoliation of the graphitic oxide 19,20 following the Hummer's method 21 and 1.53 g of Ga (OnC 4 H 9 ) 3 (referred to as Ga(OBu) 3 ) were suspended in 500 mL of cyclohexane (super dehydrated, Wako Pure Chemicals).The suspension was stirred at room temperature (RT) for several days in order to disperse dried GO in cyclohexane homogeneously and to load Ga(OBu) 3 on the dried GO.Above processes were carried out in a nitrogen purged glove box because Ga(OBu) 3 is highly deliquescent.The obtained material is denoted as Ga(OBu) 3 /GO.Ga(OBu) 3 /GO was dispersed in 540 mL of cyclohexane and transferred to Teflon containers in a stainlesssteel autoclave.Then the autoclave was heated at 453 K for 6 h.During the heating, Ga(OBu) 3 was mostly oxidized to be GaO x and GO was partly reduced and referred to as rGO.Then, the resultant material was centrifuged and dried in a vacuum overnight to get GaO x /rGO.Finally, GaO x /rGO was calcined in air at a temperature ranging from 823 to 1123 K for 2 h (temperature raising rate: 2 C/min) to get sheet-like nsGa 2 O 3 (denoted as nsGa 2 O 3 (X K), where X indicates the calcination temperature). Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction tests were conducted using nsGa 2 O 3 with Ag loading as a co-catalyst.Commercially available -Ga 2 O 3 (Kojundo Chemical Laboratory Co., Ltd., Purity 99.99, denoted as -Ga 2 O 3 ) was also tested for the comparison.The 0.5 wt Ag co-catalyst was loaded by a photodeposition method with using AgNO 3 (Kishida Chemical Co., Ltd., Purity 99.8) as a precursor.However, the loaded Ag co-catalyst on nsGa 2 O 3 was unstable in water under UV light irradiation to be oxidized or reduced to large metallic particles, resulting in the loss of catalytic activity.Recently we have succeeded to control and stabilize the size and distribution of Ag nanoparticles (Ag NPs) on Ga 2 O photocatalysts with using aqueous solution of methanol 17.Therefore, the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction tests were conducted using the aqueous solution of methanol with the optimized concentration of vol, which made Ag-NPs stable during the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction tests and gave reproducible results to compare the photocatalytic activities of synthesized nsGa 2 O 3 with that of -Ga 2 O 3 . Three samples thus prepared were subjected to photocatalytic CO reduction tests; two samples consisting of the phase (nsGa 2 O 3 (1023 K) and ns Ga 2 O 3 (1123 K)), and -Ga 2 O 3 with Ag loaded as a co-catalyst.The loaded amounts were determined as 0.24, 0.39 and 0.33 wt, respectively from X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy measurement .Three samples are referred to as Ag/nsGa 2 O 3 (1023 K), Ag/nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) and Ag/-Ga 2 O 3 ) hereafter. The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction tests were carried out in a fixedbed flow reactor cell.50 mg of the sample was dispersed in the aqueous solution of 10 mL of NaHCO 3 (1 M) and 2 mL of methanol.The air in the cell was replaced with CO 2 gas with the flow rate of 50 mL/min for 30 min.Then, the tests were conducted with UV irradiation under the CO 2 gas with the flow rate of 3.0 mL/min.A 300 W Xe lamp was used as the UV source and its light intensity was about 25 mW/cm 2 in the wavelength range of 254 10 nm.The reaction products (mainly CO and H 2 ) were analyzed by a gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector.Without the CO 2 flow in the reaction cell, the amount of produced CO was very small.This confirms that methanol hardly influenced the CO 2 reduction in the present experiments as already found in previous works 17,18. For understanding of the formation process of nsGa 2 O 3 , thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted with a Thermo plus EVO2 (Rigaku) using a Pt pan sample holder in air, with a heating rate of 5 K/ min.Characterization of samples was performed by a transmission electron microscope (TEM), a scanning electron microscope (SEM), Xray diffraction (XRD), X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) and UV-Vis diffuse reflectance (UV-Vis DR).Specific surface area (SSA) was also measured. TEM images of the samples were acquired with JEM-2100F, operating at 200 kV.SEM images of the samples were acquired with JSM-6500F, operating at 15 kV.XRD patterns of the samples were recorded on a MiniFlex600 (Rigaku) using Cu K as a radiation source with an operating voltage of 40 kV and current of 15 mA.The XRD patterns were collected at 2 angles of 10-80 .The 2 step size was 0.02 , and the scanning rate was 5 /min.Ga K-edge XAFS spectra of nsGa 2 O 3 were measured at the beamline 5S1 in Aichi Synchrotron Radiation Center using a Si(1 1 1) double-crystal monochromator at RT.The data were recorded in a transmission mode.Ga L 3 -edge XAFS spectra were recorded in a fluorescence yield mode at beamline 2A in UVSOR, Institute for Molecular Science, using beryl double-crystal monochromator at RT. SSA of the samples were determined by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) SSA measurements at 77 K (liquid N 2 temperature) using Monosorb (Quantachrome).Before the BET measurements, the samples were heated at 573 K for 3 h in N 2 atmosphere as a pretreatment.The adsorbed amounts of CO 2 on nsGa 2 O 3 samples and their chemical states were investigated by in-situ FT-IR measurements using FT/IR-6100 (JASCO) in the transmission mode at RT.The sample (ca.15 mg) was pressed into a disk (diameter: 10 mm) at 50 MPa and placed in an in-situ IR cell equipped with CaF 2 window.The cell allowed us in-situ measurements as well as sample heating, introduction of the reactant gas and UV light irradiation.Before the in-situ measurement, the sample was pretreated with evacuation at RT for 3 h.UV-Vis DR spectra were measured at RT using a spectrometer (JASCO V-670).The spectrum of Ba 2 SO 4 was used as the reference.The concentration of loaded Ag on Ga 2 O 3 was determined by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) measurement using with EDX-720 (Shimadzu) whose primary X-ray source is Rh. As mentioned in the experimental section, GO was partly reduced and GaO x /rGO was produced during the heat treatment at 453 K in the autoclave.The following calcination of GaO x /rGO at higher temperature resulted in the planar aggregates of nsGa 2 O 3 by removing rGO and full oxidation of GaO x .In order to understand the above process, TGA was done both for GO and GaO x /rGO in the temperatures ranging from to 900 K.The results were given in Fig. 2. The weight losses of GO appeared at around 320 K and 500 K were caused by water desorption and oxidative evaporation of functional groups such as -OH and -COOH in GO, respectively 21.The full combustion of carbon started at around 800 K and completed at 900 K.In the TGA profile of GaO x / rGO, the gradual loss continued until the final full combustion.Since no clear loss corresponding to the evaporation of the functional groups was observed, GO must be mildly reduced during the autoclave treatment.That is the reason for using the terminology of rGO.Even if there was the evaporation of the functional groups, the weight gain caused by the oxidation of GaOx could hinder the evaporation loss.After the full combustion at around 900 K only Ga 2 O 3 remained.From the weight of the remained Ga 2 O 3 , we have determined the loading amount of Ga 2 O in the GaO x /rGO to be 25 wt which included some uncertainty caused by the full oxidation of GaOx to Ga 2 O 3 . Fig. 3 shows SEM images of GaO x /rGO, and Fig. 4 shows TEM images of GO and GaO x /rGO.The SEM images clearly show that GaO x /rGO is consisting of petal-like sheets with their width of around a few m.Each sheet of GaO x /rGO is transparent in the TEM image.The sheet seems homogenous and a little thicker than GO sheet except some segregation of GaO x which is appreciable as local black colored areas.The existence of GaO x on rGO was confirmed by the appearance of amorphous like patterns in XRD (See Fig. 7(a)).In EXAFS analysis, the existence of GaO x was also confirmed, and the bonding or coordination of a gallium atom to the first and second neighboring ones were depicted as described below. In Fig. 1 is indicated how nsGa 2 O 3 synthesis proceeded according to the obtained results.(Fig. 5(a,b)), respectively.As for RSFs, the first peak around 1-2 A was assigned to the backscattering from adjacent atoms to a gallium atom, corresponding to Ga-O bond for both -Ga 2 O 3 and GaO x /rGO.Although the second peak around 2.5-3 A appeared in the RSF of GaO x /rGO (Fig. 5(c)) seems well corresponding to the second-neighboring Ga atoms (Ga-(O)-Ga) appeared in the RSF of -Ga 2 O 3 (Fig. 5(d)) 222324, the curve-fitting analysis of GaO x /rGO suggests that the second peak is caused by Ga-O and Ga-C bonds having longer interatomic distances than first neighboring Ga-O bond.The appearance of these longer Ga-O and Ga-C bonds is likely caused by the junction between GaO x species and rGO in atomic scales.The absence of Ga-(O)-Ga bond also suggests GaO x species on rGO were highly dispersed rather than aggregated. Fig. 6 compares TEM images of nsGa 2 O 3 (823-1123 K) and -Ga 2 O 3 .The images clearly indicate the difference in the morphology among synthesized nsGa 2 O 3 and -Ga 2 O 3 .It should be noted that two dimensional structure of the GaO x /rGO was maintained after the removal of the rGO.Thus, sheet-like materials consisting of nano-sized polycrystalline were successfully synthesized by the present method.Although the average size of polycrystalline became larger with increasing the calcination temperature, planar aggregate structures made of nano-particulates were maintained even for nsGa 2 O 3 calcined at such high temperature as 1123 K (sample nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K)). Table 1 shows the results of BET SSA measurements for nsGa 2 O 3 (823-1123 K) and -Ga 2 O 3 .It should be noted that SSA of nsGa 2 O 3 (823-1123 K) are larger than that of -Ga 2 O 3 about 18, 11, 9.8 and 6.5 times, respectively. In Fig. 7, XRD patterns of GaO x /rGO, nsGa 2 O 3 (823-1123 K) and -Ga 2 O 3 were compared.The XRD pattern of GaO x /rGO spreads widely with low intensity, including a broad peak assigned to (0 0 2) plane of graphite (Fig. 7(a)) 25.This indicates that very thin amorphous like GaO x or highly dispersed small GaO x particles were loaded on rGO.As the calcination temperature increased, the crystallinity of nsGa 2 O samples was improved.The higher the crystallinity of nsGa 2 O 3 became, the smaller SSA was.The XRD patterns of nsGa 2 O 3 (823, 923 K) were consisting of the mixed diffraction patterns of -Ga 2 O 3 and -Ga 2 O 3 , while those of nsGa 2 O 3 (1023, 1123 K) were assigned to the single phase of -Ga 2 O 3 .Thus, after removing rGO from GaO x /rGO by calcination, GaO x turned to be aggregation of nano-sized particles, which maintained the sheet like form and consisted of mixed phases of and by calcination at 823-923 K.The calcination above 1023 K made all particles to the single phase of -Ga 2 O 3 . The crystallite size was calculated from the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the most intense diffraction peak using the Scherrer's equation as shown in Table 1.Since the crystallite sizes derived from the Scherrer's equation was consistent with that observed in the TEM images in Fig. 6(b),(d),(f) and (h), it can be concluded that nsGa 2 O 3 were formed by crystallization of amorphous like Ga 2 O 3 sheet and aggregation of the crystallized nano-particles with keeping the sheet like form.Fig. 8 compares Ga L 3 -edge XANES spectra of single phases of , and in (a) with those of nsGa 2 O 3 in (b).It is known that Ga L 3 -edge XAFS analysis gives more detailed information on the local symmetry structures of nsGa 2 O 3 compared with Ga K-edge XAFS analysis 14,26.As seen in Fig. 8 (a), the intensities of the peak around 1107 eV decreases in the order of -Ga 2 O 3 , -Ga 2 O 3 and -Ga 2 O 3 .The main difference among these three phases is number density of hexacoordinated Ga atoms structure; the highest one is -Ga 2 O 3 in which all Ga atoms are hexacoordinated, the second, -Ga 2 O 3 including some tetracoordinated Ga atoms, and the least, -Ga 2 O 3 consisting of hexacoordinated Ga and tetracoordinated Ga atoms evenly. As shown in Fig. 8(b), the peak intensity around 1107 eV of the Ga L 3 -edge XANES spectra of nsGa 2 O 3 decreased with increasing the calcination temperature.This indicates that nsGa 2 O 3 calcined at lower temperature were mainly composed of hexacoordinated Ga atoms, while the calcination of nsGa 2 O 3 at higher temperature increases tetracoordinated Ga atmos.This is consistent with the results of XRD measurement. Although Ga K-edge EXAFS spectra of nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) and -Ga 2 O were similar with each other (Fig. 9(a)), derived RSFs from them showed the important difference; the second peak at around 2.7 A attributed to Ga-(O)-Ga bond was lower for nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) than that of -Ga 2 O 3 (See Fig. 9(b)).Using the curve fitting, the coordination number for Ga-(O)-Ga bond was evaluated and given in Table 2.The coordination number in nsGa 2 O 3 is a little smaller than that in -Ga 2 O 3 .Considering that EXAFS provides sub-nm or nm sized local structure, the difference in the coordination number suggests that nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) consisting of -Ga 2 O 3 crystalline structure is a little defective compared to fully crystalized one, owing to its very thin planer structure consisting of nano-particulates. Fig. 10 compares the production rates of H 2 and CO and the selectivity toward CO evolution observed for three tested samples in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction using aqueous solution with methanol.H 2 and CO were continuously evolved throughout the reaction tests for both samples.CO production rate of Ag/nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) was over 2 times higher than that of Ag/-Ga 2 O 3 , while H 2 production rate was lower.Consequently, CO selectivity (the ratio of CO production amount to total amounts of reduction products) of Ag/nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) reached 70.nsGa 2 O 3 (1023 K) showed a little less activity than that for nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K), probably because its crystallinity was less than that of the latter.Hence the discussion was focused to comparison of Ag/ nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) and Ag/-Ga 2 O 3. Since CO could be evolved from methanol or NaHCO 3, the reduction test without CO 2 flow was conducted.As shown in Fig. 11, the CO production rate without CO 2 flow was only 1.5-3.4mol/h.Furthermore, no CO production was observed without Ag/nsGa 2 O 3 .Therefore, it is confirmed that most of the generated CO was derived from the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction and nsGa 2 O 3 prepared by the present method was suitable for CO 2 reduction rather than H 2 production from water compared to -Ga 2 O 3 used here. It was found that nsGa 2 O 3 (sheet-like nanometer-sized particulate Ga 2 O 3 ) exhibiting well crystallized -phase gave better performance in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction than that given by -Ga 2 O 3 .The improvement is, in some sense, a corollary of ultrafine particulation, as appeared in the increase of SSA.Still nsGa 2 O 3 exhibits different characters relating photocatalytic activity compared with those of -Ga 2 O 3 .They are CO 2 absorption capability and states of Ag cocatalyst on them. To reveal the adsorbed species on nsGa 2 O 3 and -Ga 2 O 3 as prepared, in-situ FT-IR measurements were conducted.Fig. 12 shows FT-IR spectra in wavelength range 2600-3800 cm -1 , which represent adsorbed water or hydroxyl groups on nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) and -Ga 2 O 3 .The larger peak intensity for nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) than -Ga 2 O 3 well corresponds to the larger SSA of the former.Since nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) exhibiting -Ga 2 O phase was a little defective compared to fully crystalized one, included defects in nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) likely contribute to provide adsorption sites for hydroxyl groups.To make detailed comparison on adsorbed hydroxyl groups on both samples, the two FT-IR spectra are compared by normalizing with their peak intensity at 3463 cm -1 as the inset of Fig. 12.Two peaks at 3720 and 3653 cm -1 are appreciable, which are assigned to the stretching vibration of single and bridge bonded hydroxyl groups, respectively 27.The larger intensity of these peaks for nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) than -Ga 2 O 3 indicates that the former adsorbed more hydroxyl groups compared to the latter.Fig. 13 shows the difference FT-IR spectra of the adsorbed species on nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) and -Ga 2 O 3 after introduction of 45 Torr of CO 2 .The absorption bands at 1635 and 1420 cm -1 are assigned to asymmetric CO 3 stretching vibration as (CO 3 ) and symmetric CO 3 stretching vibration s (CO 3 ) of monodentate bicarbonate species, respectively 28293031, while the bands at 1590 and 1320 cm -1 are attributed to as (CO 3 ) and s (CO 3 ) of bidentate carbonate species, respectively 282930.CO 2 molecules would react with the surface hydroxyl groups and the surface lattice oxygen of Ga 2 O 3 to form the monodentate bicarbonate species and bidentate carbonate species 32,33.The former is assigned to be an intermediated state for CO production over Ga 2 O 34.The significant increases of monodentate bicarbonate species on nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) compared to those on -Ga 2 O 3 could be one of the causes for the higher CO production on nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K). Fig. 14 shows UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra of nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) and -Ga 2 O 3 with comparison of Ag/nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) and Ag/-Ga 2 O after use for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction test.Before the Ag loading, the absorption derived from the bandgap transition of Ga 2 O appeared at 290 nm in both samples (Fig. 14a).As for Ag/ nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) and Ag/-Ga 2 O 3 after use (Fig. 14b), an absorption peak around 430 nm attributed to localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of small Ag nanoparticle (Ag NPs) was observed 33.It should be mentioned that without methanol addition, Ag-NPs on nsGa 2 O 3 were not stable and the absorption peak around 430 nm were broadened and/ or decreased, accompanying the activity loss.Recently, we have found the nearly linear relationship of the LSPR intensity (i.e., the number density of small Ag NPs) and the CO production rate and concluded that Ag NPs showing the LSPR absorption peak are active sites for the CO reduction 17.Since the LSPR peaks were sharp and more intense in The size distributions are given in Fig. 16.Thus ultrafine particulation of Ga 2 O 3 seems to stabilize AgNPs to be ca.20 nm or less, the suitable size as Ag cocatalyst by avoiding their aggregation. We have succeeded in synthesizing sheet-like Ga 2 O 3 (nsGa 2 O 3 ) with using GO as a template by loading Ga 2 O 3 precursor on GO followed by GO removal by calcination at higher temperatures.The synthesized nsGa 2 O 3 consists of the planner aggregation of the nanometer-sized Ga 2 O 3 particles which are much smaller than those of Ga 2 O 3 synthesized by a simple calcination such as commercially available -Ga 2 O 3 and other synthesized Ga 2 O 3 samples in our previous work 5.Accordingly, the specific surface area (SSA) of nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) was much larger than that of -Ga 2 O 3 .The crystallinity and crystalline phase of nsGa 2 O 3 were changed with the calcination temperature.Among all synthesized nsGa 2 O 3 samples, nsGa 2 O 3 (1123 K) which was consisted of the only -phase showed the highest CO production rate and CO selectivity in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with water including NaHCO 3 and methanol. Thus, we can conclude that nsGa 2 O 3 (sheet-like nanometer-sized particulate Ga 2 O 3 ) exhibiting well crystalized -phase gives better performance in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.At the present stage, it is difficult to mention the particular cause for the improvement.Observed changes in characters relating the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction are the increase of SSA, larger CO 2 adsorption ability and the loading state of Ag co-catalyst.Those are in some sense a corollary of ultrafine particulation.Still the crystalline phase and crystallite size of nsGa 2 O 3 were not fully controlled, it remains as a future work to optimize them for further improvement of the activity of nsGa 2 O 3 for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.
