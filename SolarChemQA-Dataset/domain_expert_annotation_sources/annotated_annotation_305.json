Sulfur-doped g-C 3 N 4 (TCN) was found to absorb light up to 475 nm corresponding to a band gap of 2.63 eV, which was narrower than that of un-doped g-C 3 N 4 (MCN) with a band gap of 2.7 eV.

Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained on a D/Max-RB X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku, Japan), utilizing Cu K radiation at a scan rate (2A) of 0.05 s -1 .The accelerating voltage and applied current were 40 kV and 80 mA, respectively.Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis was carried out on a Tecnai G 2 F20 S-TWIN microscope in the condition of an accelerating voltage of 200 kV.X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were conducted by using an ultra-high-vacuum VG ESCALAB 210 electron spectrometer equipped with a multichannel detector.The samples were excited using Mg K radiation of two anodes in the constant analyzer energy mode, and XPS was operating at 200 W.All the binding energies were referenced to the C 1s peak at 284.6 eV which are adventitious carbon signals resulting from instrument or from the surface of the catalyst.The content of C, N, and S was analyzed by the CHNSO elemental analyzer (Vario EL cube, Elementar Analysensysteme GmbH, Germany) equipped with a balance which is accurate up to one over one million.UV-vis diffuse reflection spectra (DRS) were obtained by using a dry-pressed disk sample with a UV-vis spectrophotometer (UV-2550, Shimadzu, Japan), and BaSO 4 is used as reflectance standard.The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of the samples were obtained by using an IRAffinity-1 FTIR spectrometer which uses conventional KBr pellets in the frequency range of 4000 cm -1 to 500 cm -1 at room temperature.Micromeritics ASAP 2020 nitrogen adsorption apparatus (USA) was used to record Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface area (S BET ) of photocatalysts and all of the samples were degassed at 180 C before analysis.The pore size distributions were evaluated using desorption data with Barret-Joyner-Halender (BJH) method.The BET surface area was determined by a multipoint BET method to analyze the adsorption data in the relative pressure (P/P 0 ) range from 0.05 to 0.25.Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were obtained on a Fluorescence Spectrophotometer (F-7000, Hitachi, Japan) at room temperature.The Photo Multiplier Tube (PMT) voltage was 700 V, the scanning speed was 1200 nm/min, and the excitation wavelength was 380 nm.The widths used for the excitation and emission slit were both 1.0 nm.
