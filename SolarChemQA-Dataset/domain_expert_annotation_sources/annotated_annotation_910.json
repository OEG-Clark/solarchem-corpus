Structural characteristicsAs shown in Fig.1, the XRD patterns revealed that all the samples were present in well crystalline states of In 2 O 3 and g-C 3 N 4 .The pure g-C 3 N 4 displayed two peaks around 13.1 and 27.4 characteristic of (100) and (002) facets.The In 2 O 3 was present in cubic structure (JCPDS card no.06-0416) with the characteristic peaks at 30 , 35 , 51 , and 60 , corresponding (111), (100), (110), (622) facets, respectively.All the Pt/In 2 O 3 /g-C 3 N 4 showed typical peaks indicative of individual In 2 O 3 and g-C 3 N 4 , indicating no chemical bonding formed between In 2 O 3 and g-C 3 N 4 .No signicant diffraction peaks indicative of Pt were observed in Pt/In 2 O 3 , Pt/g-C 3 N 4 , or Pt-INCN owing to the low Pt-loading with high dispersion of Pt nanoparticles.The SEM and TEM images in Fig. 2 demonstrated that the In 2 O 3 was present in nanosheets with an average length of 1-2 mm and widths of 50-100 nm, while the g-C 3 N 4 was present in a lamina structure with uniform porous structure.The 10INCN composite displayed well dispersion of In 2 O 3 nanosheets onto the g-C 3 N 4 .From 2Pt-10INCN, we could see very tiny Pt nanoparticles uniformly distributed onto the In 2 O 3 /g-C 3 N 4 support.Interestingly, most of Pt nanoparticles were deposited onto the In 2 O 3 nanosheets.This could be easily understood since Pt ions would be more easily reduced on the In 2 O 3 than on the g-C 3 N 4 owing to the presence of Lewis acid sites which favored the adsorption of PtCl 6 2A ions.The HRTEM image further conrmed that the Pt nanoparticles were embedded on the interface between In 2 O 3 and g-C 3 N 4 in 2Pt-10INCN.Both In 2 O 3 and g-C 3 N 4 were present in well-dened crystals, in good accordance with the XRD patterns.The heterojunction was formed between In 2 O 3 and g-C 3 N 4 .The mapping images clari-ed the existence of In 2 O 3 and g-C 3 N 4 in 2Pt-10INCN, together with the uniform distribution of Pt nanoparticles.The actual In 2 O 3 -contents and Pt-loading in the composite photocatalysts were determined by ICP and expressed in mass percentage (Table ).Although the similar pore volume, the In 2 O 3 exhibited higher surface area and bigger pore size than the g-C 3 N 4 owing to the porous structure constructed layer-by-layer from In 2 O 3 nanosheets.The INCN exhibited decreased surface area and pore size due to the incorporation of In 2 O 3 nanosheets into the porous g-C 3 N 4 , leading to the close package of In 2 O 3 nanosheets.The pore volume of INCN greatly increased in comparison with both In 2 O 3 and g-C 3 N 4 , possibly owing to the formation of new micropores during the co-assembling process of In 2 O 3 and g-C 3 N 4 .All the Pt-INCN displayed lower surface area and larger pore size as well as smaller pore volume, suggesting most Pt nanoparticles were embedded into the pore channels constructed layer-by-layer from In 2 O 3 nanosheets.Some micropores were blocked by those Pt nanoparticles, which could account for the increase of average pore size and abrupt decrease of pore volume.

In 2 O 3 and g-C 3 N 4 could be activated by visible lights.The 5INCN displayed a broader adsorption area with an obvious red-shi in comparison with the pure In 2 O 3 and g-C 3 N 4 , which could be understood by considering the appearance of some intermediate energy bands owing to the formation of heterojunctions between In 2 O 3 and g-C 3 N 4 .Further increase in the ratio of In 2 O 3 to g-C 3 N 4 (from 5INCN to 20INCN) had no signicant inuence on the light absorbance edge, suggesting no more heterojunctions formed.Meanwhile, both Pt/In 2 O 3 and Pt/g-C 3 N 4 exhibited red-shi comparing to pure In 2 O 3 and g-C 3 N 4 , obviously owing to plasma effect from Pt nanoparticles, which could also account for the red-shi of light absorbance by loading Pt onto INCN.However, the change of Pt-loading from 1 wt to 2 wt had a very limited effect on the light adsorption edge, suggesting the similar size of Pt nanoparticles, and thus, the increased Ptloading could only enhance the light adsorption intensity.However, 2.5Pt-10INCN displayed a blue-shi of light absorbance wavelength due to the gathering of Pt nanoparticles, which reduced the plasma effect.All the increasing ratio of In 2 O 3 to g-C 3 N 4 had almost on effect on the light absorbance Fig. 3 XPS spectra in (a) C 1s, (b) N 1s, (c) O 1s and (d) In 3d and (e) Pt 4f levels.

The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was performed in a self-made 50 mL quartz reactor.Before reaction, 20 mg catalyst was dispersed in 10 mL ultra-pure water under ultrasonication for 30 min.Then, 1 mL TEOA (Aladdin) was introduced as a sacri-cial agent.The suspension was transferred onto a 50 mL quartz reactor with two vents.High purity CO 2 (99.99) was introduced into the reactor and bubbled for 0.5 h to evacuate the air inside the reactor.Then, the reactor was sealed and lled with CO 2 to 1 atm.For each run of reactions, the reaction system was irradiated for 4 h by four 3 W LED lights with the wavelength of 420 nm at a constant temperature of 35 C and stirring rate of 800 rpm.The gas products were analyzed by a gas chromatography equipped by HP-PLOT Q column connected with the FID detector and TDX-01 connected with TCD detector.The liquid products were detected by ion chromatography (Dionex DX-320) with an analytical column (Dionex IonPac AS19-4 mm Analytical Column).S1 ), which generally matched with the theoretical contents in the mother solution.All samples displayed type-IV N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms with a hysteresis loop of type H3 characteristic of porous structure (Fig. S1 ).Based on the N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms, the surface area, pore size, and pore volume were calculated (Table S2 The XPS spectra in Fig. 3 revealed that all the In species were present in In 3 state, corresponding to the binding energies (BE) of 445.8 eV and 453.4 eV at In 3d 5/2 and 3d 3/2 levels. 33The negative BE shi suggested the strong interaction between In 2 O 3 and g-C 3 N 4 , in which partial electrons transferred from g- in the metallic state. 34The Pt/In 2 O 3 displayed negative BE shi of Pt and positive BE shi of In 3 , which further conrmed that most Pt nanoparticles deposited onto In 2 O 3 nanosheets, in which partial electrons transferred from In 3 to Pt owing to the strong metal-support interaction, taking into account of the higher electronegativity of Pt (2.28) than that of In 3 (1.78). 32All the O species were present in O 2A state.The peak at 531.4 eV was assigned to lattice-oxygen and the peak at 532.5 eV was ascribed to chemisorbed oxygen. 35Aer Pt-loading, the BE of lattice-oxygen showed a negative shi owing to the acceptance of partial electrons from metallic Pt.Besides, the well-dispersed Pt nanoparticles on the In 2 O 3 surface promoted the chemisorption of oxygen, leading to the enhanced intensity of the peak around 532.5 eV. 36The C species in 10INCN were mainly presented in C-N-C coordination, corresponding to the BE at 288.2 eV in C 1s level.The weak shoulder peak at 284.5 eV was ascribed to the sp 2 C-C bond. 37The N species displayed various states, corresponding to the different binding energies in the N 1s level.The main signal around 398.6 eV corresponded to the N in C-N-C bond, while the shoulder peak at 400.3 eV was ascribed to the N in the N-(C) 3 group. 38No signicant BE shi of either the C or the N was observed, possibly due to the symmetric structure in C-N-C bond.", "vote": "1"}, {"llm generation": "LED", "source": "Reaction conditions: Four 3 W LED (420 nm), 1 atm CO 2 , 20 mg catalyst, 10 mL H 2 O, 1 mL TEOA, 35 C, 4 h.", "context": "We developed a Pt/In 2 O 3 /g-C 3 N 4 multifunctional catalyst by controlling the assembling method.This catalyst exhibited high activity and selectivity to HCOOH during visible-light-driven photocatalytic CO 2 reduction owing to the synergetic effects in producing H atoms via water splitting, adsorbing/activating CO 2 molecules, and inhibiting photoelectron-hole recombination by accelerating electron transfer and forming heterojunctions.Besides, it also displayed a long lifetime owing to the high structural stability and the strong interaction to inhibit Pt leaching.This work supplied a promising way for designing new catalysts with multiple functions for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction at normal pressure and room temperature with a high yield of target products. Structural characteristicsAs shown in Fig.1, the XRD patterns revealed that all the samples were present in well crystalline states of In 2 O 3 and g-C 3 N 4 .The pure g-C 3 N 4 displayed two peaks around 13.1 and 27.4 characteristic of (100) and (002) facets.The In 2 O 3 was present in cubic structure (JCPDS card no.06-0416) with the characteristic peaks at 30 , 35 , 51 , and 60 , corresponding (111), (100), (110), (622) facets, respectively.All the Pt/In 2 O 3 /g-C 3 N 4 showed typical peaks indicative of individual In 2 O 3 and g-C 3 N 4 , indicating no chemical bonding formed between In 2 O 3 and g-C 3 N 4 .No signicant diffraction peaks indicative of Pt were observed in Pt/In 2 O 3 , Pt/g-C 3 N 4 , or Pt-INCN owing to the low Pt-loading with high dispersion of Pt nanoparticles.The SEM and TEM images in Fig. 2 demonstrated that the In 2 O 3 was present in nanosheets with an average length of 1-2 mm and widths of 50-100 nm, while the g-C 3 N 4 was present in a lamina structure with uniform porous structure.The 10INCN composite displayed well dispersion of In 2 O 3 nanosheets onto the g-C 3 N 4 .From 2Pt-10INCN, we could see very tiny Pt nanoparticles uniformly distributed onto the In 2 O 3 /g-C 3 N 4 support.Interestingly, most of Pt nanoparticles were deposited onto the In 2 O 3 nanosheets.This could be easily understood since Pt ions would be more easily reduced on the In 2 O 3 than on the g-C 3 N 4 owing to the presence of Lewis acid sites which favored the adsorption of PtCl 6 2A ions.The HRTEM image further conrmed that the Pt nanoparticles were embedded on the interface between In 2 O 3 and g-C 3 N 4 in 2Pt-10INCN.Both In 2 O 3 and g-C 3 N 4 were present in well-dened crystals, in good accordance with the XRD patterns.The heterojunction was formed between In 2 O 3 and g-C 3 N 4 .The mapping images clari-ed the existence of In 2 O 3 and g-C 3 N 4 in 2Pt-10INCN, together with the uniform distribution of Pt nanoparticles.The actual In 2 O 3 -contents and Pt-loading in the composite photocatalysts were determined by ICP and expressed in mass percentage (Table ).Although the similar pore volume, the In 2 O 3 exhibited higher surface area and bigger pore size than the g-C 3 N 4 owing to the porous structure constructed layer-by-layer from In 2 O 3 nanosheets.The INCN exhibited decreased surface area and pore size due to the incorporation of In 2 O 3 nanosheets into the porous g-C 3 N 4 , leading to the close package of In 2 O 3 nanosheets.The pore volume of INCN greatly increased in comparison with both In 2 O 3 and g-C 3 N 4 , possibly owing to the formation of new micropores during the co-assembling process of In 2 O 3 and g-C 3 N 4 .All the Pt-INCN displayed lower surface area and larger pore size as well as smaller pore volume, suggesting most Pt nanoparticles were embedded into the pore channels constructed layer-by-layer from In 2 O 3 nanosheets.Some micropores were blocked by those Pt nanoparticles, which could account for the increase of average pore size and abrupt decrease of pore volume.
