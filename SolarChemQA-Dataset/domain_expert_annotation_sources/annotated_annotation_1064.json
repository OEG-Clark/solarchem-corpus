30 mL of Ti (OC 4 H 9 ) 4 as souse of Ti and a certain amount of hydrofluoric acid (HF) with a concentration of 40 wt as crystal control agent were mixed under stirring to produce a homogeneous solution.The solution was transferred into a dried Teflon-lined autoclave with a capacity of 100 mL at room temperature and then kept at 180 C for 48 h.After the hydrothermal reaction, the white precipitates were collected by centrifugation, washed with ethanol and distilled water three times, and then dried in an oven at 80 C for 12 h.According to the adding amount of HF (200, 140, 70, and 0 mmol) used in the synthesis, the as-obtained samples were labeled as xHF-TiO 2 (x 3, 2, 1, 0).As the value of x increases, the percentage of exposed 0 0 1 facets increases. Cr 2 O 3 was implanted on the as-prepared xHF-TiO 2 (x 3, 2, 1, 0) by photodeposition under UV-visible light irradiation.K 2 CrO 4 solution was used as the source of Cr.In a typical preparation, 0.15 g of xHF-TiO 2 and a certain concentration of K 2 CrO 4 aqueous solution were dispersed in 100 mL of an aqueous solution, which was then degassed completely and irradiated with a 300 W Xe lamp (CEL-HXUV300E, Beijing CEAULIGHT Technology Co., Ltd.) under stirring for 4 h.The obtained photocatalysts were collected by centrifugation, washed with ethanol and distilled water, and dried at -50 C in a lyophilizer for 24 h.The samples were denoted as xHF-TiO 2 /yCr 2 O 3 , where y indicates the apparent loading amounts of Cr 2 O 3 (y 0-1.5).For example, when 3HF-TiO 2 was applied for Cr 2 O 3 implanting, 0.05 wt, 0.1 wt, and 0.5 wt of Cr precursor were fed, the corresponding as-obtained samples were then labelled as 3HF-TiO 2 /0.05Cr 2 O 3 , 3HF-TiO 2 /0.1Cr 2 O 3 , and 3HF-TiO 2 /0.5Cr 2 O 3 , respectively.All the other samples were denoted in the same manner. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was carried out to determine the crystalline structures of the samples by an X-ray diffractometer (TTRIII, Rigaku) with Cu K radiation at a scan rate of 10 /min.Raman spectral (LabRam HR Raman spectrometer) was used to estimate the percentage of certain exposed facets.The excitation wavelength is 532 nm.The morphology of samples was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2011F) and scanning electron microscope (Genimi SEM 500).To further identify the location and distribution of Cr 2 O 3 on TiO 2 , highresolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, Talos F200X) was applied.Synchrotron-radiation vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectrometry (SVUV-PIMS) was carried out at BL03U beamline at the National Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (NSRL).High resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was recorded at beamline BL10B in NSRL.The Cr content was determined by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) (VG, USA).UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-Vis DRS) were measured by a UVvisible absorption spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-2600, Japan) in the wavelength range of 300-700 nm, using BaSO 4 as the reference.The CO 2 adsorption isotherms tests and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area were conducted on ASAP 2020 automatic adsorption apparatus (Micromeritics, USA).The photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured by a steady-state fluorescence spectrometer (JY Fluorolog-3-Tou, France).The excitation wavelength was 340 nm.Time-resolved PL spectra were measured by using Edinburgh Photonics FLS980 fluorescence spectrophotometer based on the time-correlated single-photon counting technology. The photoelectrochemical analyses were performed by a conventional three-electrode system, under the irradiation of a 300 W Xe lamp (PLS-SXE 300, Perfect Light, China).During the test, its intensity was adjusted to 100 mW/cm 2 .A working electrode was prepared as follows: 5 mg of samples and 5 L of 5 wt Nafion were dispersed in an aqueous solution containing 1 mL water-ethanol solution with a volume ratio of 1:1.120 L of the mixture was coated onto a 1 1 cm 2 fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass and then dried at 80 C for 1 h.A Pt mesh was used as a counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode.1 M NaOH aqueous solution (pH 13.6) was used as the electrolytes.All the measured potentials were converted to RHE (E RHE E Ag/AgCl 0.197 0.0591 pH, E Ag/AgCl 0.1976 V vs. NHE at 25 C).Amperometric I-t curves were measured under chopped light irradiation with on/off interval of 30 s at 1.23 V vs. RHE.The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were tested at frequencies from 100 kHz to Hz. The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance tests were carried out on the equipment of the CEL-SPH2N system supplied by Beijing CEAULIGHT Technology Co., Ltd.50 mg xHF-TiO 2 /yCr 2 O 3 photocatalyst with 0.4 mL H 2 O was well-distributed onto a groove of a circular glass dish with a radius of 3 cm.Then put the glass dish in a reaction cell with a total volume of 550 mL.300 W Xe lamp (CEL-HXUV300E, Beijing CEAULIGHT Technology Co., Ltd.) was used as the light source.The system was vacuumed and purged with high purity CO 2 gas several times to ensure that no air remained in the reaction vessel, then the pure CO 2 gas was injected into the reaction setup until reaching a certain pressure.All samples were tested under UV-visible irradiation for 6 h.mL of mixed gas was taken out from the reactor at fixed intervals (1 h) during the reaction and analyzed by using a gas chromatograph (GC-1690, Hangzhou Kexiao Scientific Instruments Co.
