Chemical components and valence states were analyzed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) on a Thermo Scientific ESCALab 250Xi Spectrometer with Al K radiation as the excitation source.Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) data was obtained with HeI (21.22 eV) as monochromatic light source.UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were performed on a scan UV-vis spectrometer (Cary 5000) with integrating sphere detector.The Raman spectra were obtained using a Renishaw inVia spectrophotometer.Photoelectrochemical tests in a conventional three-electrode system were recorded by a CHI 660E electrochemical workstation (Chenhua, Shanghai, China).The photocurrents of the photocatalysts were measured at 0.0 V (vs.Ag/AgCl) in Na 2 SO 4 aqueous solution under UV-visible light with AM 1.5 filter after being purged by N 2 to remove O 2 . 2.3.Photocatalytic Performance Tests.Photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction of the synthesized catalysts was evaluated in gaseous phase in a stainless steel cylindrical vessel with 15 cm length and 180 mL volume.The light source was a 300 W xenon arc lamp (PLS-SXE 300, Beijing Trust tech Co. Ltd., China) with a UV cutoff filter ( 400 nm).The catalyst powders (0.10 g) were first dispersed on a circular glass dish equipped with a quartz window for passing light irradiation.Prior to photoreduction experiments, the reaction setup was vacuum-treated and then, high purity CO 2 gas (99.995) as purging and reaction gas was introduced into the reaction system for several times.The compressed high purity CO 2 gas was passed through a water bubbler to generate a mixture of CO 2 and H 2 O vapor.The distance between the sample and the light source was fixed at 11 or 30 cm to tune the irradiate intensity.After illumination, the gaseous products from the reactor were quantifiably identified for offline analysis using a GC-7890II gas chromatograph (Techcomp Corp., China) equipped with a flame ionized detector (FID) and GC-MS (Agilent 7890A-5975C) with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD).The equipped columns were TDX-01 and Porapak-Q, respectively.Other hydrocarbons were analyzed by GC-MS equipped with a DB-FFAP capillary column. Blank tests were also conducted in the absence of photocatalysts or in the dark with catalysts.No product was detected, indicating that the presence of both the visible-light irradiation and photocatalyst are indispensable for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with water.To evaluate the stability, sample 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 as a model was refreshed by washing with deionized water and its photocatalytic performance was reevaluated in the light of the aforementioned procedure.Simultaneously, contrast tests, including using the mechanical mixture samples or mixing the 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 sample with edetate disodium salt (EDTA) to scavenge the photogenerated holes, were carried out to prove the role of the heterojunctions or to verify the charge transfer mode experimentally. 2.4.Analysis of the Intermediate H 2 O 2 .The formation of H 2 O 2 on the photocatalysts was detected by the UV-vis spectrum using otolidine as peroxide indicator. 48It has been proved that the production of H 2 O 2 can be monitored by measuring the absorption peak of the 2electron oxidation product of o-tolidine at 447 nm.The detection procedures were similar to the above photocatalytic tests, except that the catalysts were replaced by the mixture of the catalyst and o-tolidine (1:1.2 weight ratios).Sampling was carried out at given time intervals and then, the obtained samples were dispersed in deionized water.The suspension was filtered after centrifugation and the resulting solution was set to the same condition for UV-vis spectrum measurements of the 2-electron oxidized toluidine by T6 UV-vis spectrophotometer (Purkinje General, Beijing, China). 2.5.Analysis of the Intermediate OH.The formation of hydroxyl radicals ( OH) was detected by the PL technique using terephthalic acid (TA) as a probe molecule.It has been proven that TA reacts readily with OH to produce 2-hydroxyterephthalic acid (TAOH) with a typical fluorescent signal at 425 nm, and the intensity of the TAOH peak is proportional to the amount of hydroxyl radicals formed. 49The detection procedures were similar to the photocatalytic experiments, except that the catalysts were replaced by the mixture of the catalyst and TA (1:1.2 weight ratio).Sampling was carried out at given irradiation time intervals, and then, the obtained samples were dispersed in water.The resulting solution after centrifugal separation was set to a same concentration for fluorescence spectral measurements.The PL peak of TAOH at 425 nm was detected using a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Hitachi F-7000) with excitation at 315 nm."}, {"llm generation": "g-C 3 N 4", "source": "we used g-C 3 N 4 , 2.5-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 , and 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 as catalysts to contrast their photocatalytic activity under different atmosphere (Table 2).", "context": "3.1.Structure and Morphology.The XRD patterns of pure g-C 3 N 4 , pure BiOI and x-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composites are displayed in Figure 1.Two characteristic peaks of pure g-C 3 N 4 are observed at 27.5and 13.1, which can be indexed to (002) and (100) diffraction planes, respectively.The strong XRD peak at 27.5is indicative of the interplanar stacking of aromatic systems with a distance of 0.326 nm, while the latter with a much weaker intensity at 13.1is attributed to in-plane repeating units with a period of 0.675 nm. 50The two diffraction peaks are in good agreement with those of other reported g-C 3 N 4 . 47Pure BiOI is in its tetragonal phase (PDF No. 00-010-0445) and exhibits several strong peaks at 29.6, 31.6,45.4, and 55.2.For the x-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composites, all the XRD patterns could be well indexed to g-C 3 N 4 and tetragonal phase of BiOI.In addition, the intensities of diffraction peaks of g-C 3 N 4 become weaker, while those of BiOI become stronger with the increase of the contents of BiOI.When the amount of BiOI is lower than 5.2 wt, the characteristic peaks of BiOI is not found, which may be attributed to lower detectable limit of instrument or to BiOI highly dispersed on the surface of g-C 3 N 4 .However, the existence of BiOI can be detected and estimated by analyses TG, as shown in Figure S1. It is worth noting that an extra peak at 12.2is observed for 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 .The peak can be ascribed to (0 0 1) plane of BiOI phase (PDF No: 01-085-0863).This phase of BiOI, similar to the former phase, has a 2D structure along c axial, and crystallizes in the Tetragonal space group P4/nmm.The difference between the two phase is the length of c axis, which deceases from 9.14 A for the former to 7.21 A for the later.The appearance of the later may be attributed to the (001) plane of BiOI coupling with g-C 3 N 4 , leading to the interaction force between BiOI and g-C 3 N 4 strengthening and as a result, the ratio of the later phase increases.The subsequent weakening of the peak may be due to the agglomerate of BiOI (Figure S6). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out to elucidate the surface composition and the chemical states of the elements.The survey XPS spectrum for 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 indicates that the composite mainly consists of C, N, Bi, I, and O atoms, which are well consistent with the chemical compositions (Figure S2).To gain more insight into the chemical bonding between the carbon and nitrogen atoms in the composite, the high resolution XPS spectra of C 1s and N 1s were deconvoluted by Gaussian-Lorenzian analysis method.For C 1s spectra (Figure 2a), two distinct peaks at 284.8 and 288.0 eV and a low intensity peak at 286.0 eV are observed.The first peak is attributed to sp 2 C-C bonds, and the second one is sp 2 hybridized carbon in N-containing aromatic ring (N-CN), 51,52 while the last peak with low intensity at around 286.0 eV may be ascribed to the C-NH 2 species on the g-C 3 N 4 . 52For N 1s spectra (Figure 2b), four fitted peaks are observed to locate at around 398.3, 399.4,400.7, and 403.9 eV, respectively.These peaks can be regarded as the sp 2 hybridized nitrogen involved in triazine rings (C-NC), the tertiary nitrogen N-(C) 3 groups, the free amino groups (C-N-H), and -excitations, respectively. 24Compared with pure g-C 3 N 4 , N 1s peaks except the -excitation one have about 0.4 shifts to higher binding energies.By contrast, the deconvoluted C 1s peaks have only a slight shift. To further probe the chemical states of Bi and I elements, the high resolution Bi 4f and I 3d XPS spectra for pure BiOI and 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 material were also deconvoluted by curve fitting method.Two strong peaks at 164.3 and 159.0 eV as well as two satellite peaks at 165.4 and 160.0 eV were detected in the composite, as shown in Figure 2c.The strong peaks, lower than those of pure BiOI, are attributed to the characteristic of Bi 4f 5/2 and Bi 4f 7/2 of Bi(III), as reported in other BiOI-based system. 53Similar shifts are also observed in the high-resolution I 3d spectra (Figure 2d).Two conspicuous peaks are available at binding energies of 618.3 eV for I 3d 5/2 and 629.8 eV for I 3d 3/2 , 54 both of which have a shift of 0.5-0.6 eV to low energy region compared with those of pure BiOI. The O 1s peak (Figure S3) was deconvoluted into three components, centered at 529.2, 531.9, and 533.4 eV, respectively.Two peaks at around 531.9 and 533.4 eV are related to absorbed H 2 O molecule and hydroxyl group on the surface. 55,56The lowest binding energy of O 1s at 529.2 eV is regarded as the Bi-O bond in Bi 2 O 2 slabs of BiOI, 57 which has about 0.4 shifts to low binding energies compared with that of pure BiOI.All the shifts for binding energy in the XPS spectra can be attributed to the intense interaction between closely contacted phases of BiOI and g-C 3 N 4 , implying that the hetero junctions have been formed in the as-synthesized composite. 58EM was used to investigate the morphology and microstructure of the synthesized catalysts.Figure 3 shows the TEM images of g-C 3 N 4 and the typical 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composite.It can be seen that the morphology of pure g-C 3 N 4 (Figure 3a) shows a characteristic crumpled layered structure.For the composite, it is observed that BiOI particles are uniformly deposited on the surface of g-C 3 N 4 (Figure 3b).To observe more clearly the microstructure of the composite, the highresolution TEM image of area e in Figure 3b is shown in Figure 3c.A lattice spacing of 0.301 nm is determined, which is attributed to the (102) facet of BiOI.The lattice fringes of g-C 3 N 4 , however, are not observed clearly due to its weak crystallization.Nevertheless, the EDX pattern of area k contains C, N, O, and Cu elements, while that of area m includes not only C, N, O, and Cu elements but also Bi and I (Figure 3d and3e).The results show that the area m is composed of g-C 3 N 4 and BiOI, implying that BiOI is closely deposited on the surface of g-C 3 N 4 layer in this region.To further explore the detailed elemental distributions, energy mappings of N, Bi, and I over the 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 were constructed (in Figure S4).All elements were uniformly distributed on composite, as confirmed by area elemental detection.From the element mapping analysis, it is observed that BiOI could be uniformly deposited on the entire surface of the g-C 3 N 4 . 3.2.UV-Vis DRS Spectra. Figure 4 shows the UV-Vis adsorption spectra of pure BiOI, g-C 3 N 4 and x-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composites.It is obvious that the absorption wavelengths of pure BiOI, g-C 3 N 4 and all the composites display distinct absorption in the visible-light region.Additionally, the absorption edge of the composites shifts regularly to long wavelength with increasing of BiOI content.The band gaps (E g ) of pure materials were estimated by the plot of (h) 1/2 versus photo energy (h) (Figure S5), considering that both BiOI 59 and g-C 3 N 4 10 are indirect band gap semiconductors.The calculated band gaps of BiOI and g-C 3 N 4 are 1.75 and 2.69 eV, respectively, which agrees well with that of the reported BiOI 60 and g-C 3 N 4 . 61.4.Photocatalytic Performance.The photoreduction CO 2 activities of the prepared photocatalysts were evaluated in the presence of water vapor under visible light irradiation.Figure 5 shows the CO 2 photoreduction yields for the assynthesized composites after 5 h irradiation.The photocatalytic products for pure g-C 3 N 4 include CO, H 2 , and O 2 , while there are no products detectable for pure BiOI.With the increase of the BiOI content in the composites, the yields of H 2 decrease monotonously while those of CO and O 2 increase and reach the maximal yields of 17.9 and 9.8 molg cat -1 , respectively, at 7.4 wt.No other products such as HCOOH, HCHO, or CH 3 OH were detected by either GC or GC-MS analyses.Besides, CH 4 , as a minor product, was detected for the composites with BiOI contents of 5.2, 7.4, and 10.1 wt.The generation of the products may be explained by the formation of heterojunctions between g-C 3 N 4 and BiOI in the composites.With the increase of the BiOI contents, the heterojunctions increase, resulting in the improvement of the yield rates of CO, CH 4 , and O 2 .When the BiOI contents get too high, the BiOI morphology is varied from lamella to the hierarchical microsphere and the specific surface area of the composites decrease (Figure S6 andS7).The efficient heterojunction interface did not increase distinctly whereas the excessive BiOI with narrow band gap would act as the recombination center of photogenerated electrons and holes. 36hus, the drop of the productivity should be ascribed to the decreasing the separation efficiency of electron-hole pairs. Figure 6 shows the photocatalytic CO 2 activities for the optimal 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 sample.As can be seen, the total yields of CH 4 , CO, H 2 , and O 2 are enhanced with the extension of the irradiation time.However, the maximal yield rates of CO, CH 4 and O 2 are found at 3 h irradiation, which attained 4.86, 0.18, and 2.78 molg cat -1 h -1 , respectively (Figure S8).The reduction of the photocatalytic activity may be ascribed to the negative effect of the produced hydrogen peroxide, as shown below. The effect of light intensity and light wavelength on the photoreduction CO 2 activity for 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 catalyst were also investigated and the results are summarized in Table 1.The product yields of CO 2 reduction increase not too much as the wavelength of irradiation light extending from 400-800 to 320-800 nm, probably due to its VLD property of the synthesized composite.Nevertheless, the yields of products, including CH 4 , H 2 , O 2 , and CO, increase with the intensity of illuminating light.As a result, the molar ratio of CH 4 /CO grows from 0 to 7.92 when the light intensity increases from 65 to 260 mWcm -2 .This can be explained in terms of the requisite electron number of generating different products.Consequently, the generation of the CO 2 reduction products is mainly dependent on the intensity of the illumination light. To confirm the role of the heterojunctions, the photocatalytic activity of CO 2 reduction of the mechanical mixtures as contrasts were measured and the results are summarized in Table S2.The yields of CO, CH 4 , and O 2 for the mechanically mixed samples decrease greatly in comparison to their counterparts, indicating that the loosely contacted interfaces are insufficient for photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .Thus, it may be reasonably deduced that the formation of heterojunctions between the interfacial phases are responsible for the enhanced photocatalytic activity of the synthesized composites.To further verify the effect of the heterojunctions, we used g-C 3 N 4 , 2.5-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 , and 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 as catalysts to contrast their photocatalytic activity under different atmosphere (Table 2).Under N 2 /H 2 O atmosphere, the products for all the samples are H 2 and O 2 , and the yields of which decrease with increasing the BiOI contents.When N 2 is replaced by CO 2 , the yields of CO or CH 4 increase with BiOI content, accompanying with the yields of H 2 deceased regularly.The results show that the reaction of CO 2 reduction is competitive to that of H 2 generation and the formation of the heterojunctions is more favorable for CO 2 reduction. On the other hand, we notice that the yield of O 2 for all the composites is lower than that expected whether in N 2 /H 2 O or in CO 2 /H 2 O atmosphere.The discrepancy between the practical yields and the calculated values may be attributed to the kinetically competitive reactions of two-electron water oxidation to hydrogen peroxide. 62To check the existence of the intermediate Reproducibility and durability are critical issues for the longterm use of a catalyst in practical application.In the durability tests, the photoreduction CO 2 of the typical 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 catalyst was repeated for five times, as shown in Figure 7.The results show that the yields of CO, CH 4 , H 2 and O 2 decreased slightly after five cycles.To illustrate the stability of the catalyst, XPS spectra measurements were applied for detecting the change of the chemical composition.It can be seen that the high resolution XPS spectra of C 1s, N 1s, and Bi 4f for 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 after five cycles maintain their peak positions as before reaction, while a small amount of I 3 -ions at 619.1 eV, 63 probably deriving from the oxidation of I -ions, could be identified (Figure S10).To further confirm the existence of I 3 ions, Raman spectra were measured.An obvious peak at 108 cm -1 in Raman spectra becomes stronger gradually, indicating the accumulation of I 3 -ions with recycling (Figure S11). 63Therefore, we assume that it is the accumulation of the -ions that results in the reduction of the recycling performance of the materials.Except for the negative effect, we assume that the detected I 3 -ions play a crucial role on the transfer of the photogenerated electrons across the heterojunctions, as shown below. 3.5.Determination of the Charge Transfer Mode.The band edge positions of the composites are known to influence directly on the reduction and oxidation reactions occurring at the catalyst surface.The band energy alignment of the typical 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composite is determined by combining UPS with XPS and DRS. Figure 8 shows the UPS spectra of g-C 3 N 4 , BiOI, and 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 measured at sample biases (-8.0 V).The valence band position (VB) of pure g-C 3 N 4 was first estimated to be situated at -6.61 eV (vs vacuum), according to the linear intersection method. 64The work function of g-C 3 N 4 was calculated to be 4.18 eV (vs vacuum) and the corresponding Fermi level (E F ) to be -4.18eV (vs vacuum).Considering that the band gap (E g ) of pure g-C 3 N 4 is 2.69 eV, the conduction band position (CB) is located at ca. -3.92 eV (vs.vacuum).Correspondingly, the potentials of E VB and E CB are positioned at 2.17 and -0.52 eV (vs NHE), respectively, based on the relationship between the vacuum energy (E abs ) and the normal electrode potential (E ), E abs -E -4.44. 64imilarly, the values of E VB , E CB , and E F of BiOI are determined to be 2.42, 0.67, and 2.01 eV (vs.NHE) (Table S3). With the formation of the BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 heterostructures, alignment of the Fermi levels is assumed at the interfacial phases of two components. 36The value of apparent E F of the composite can be estimated to be 0.30 eV (vs.NHE) by linear intersection method in the UPS spectrum.Accompanying with the movement of Fermi levels, the CB and VB edge positions for both BiOI and g-C 3 N 4 are shifted upward or downward.In this case, the band offsets of 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunctions can be calculated using XPS core-level (CL) alignment method. 65The XPS core-level and valence band spectra of the pure materials and the 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 heterostructure are shown in Figures 2 andS12, respectively.According to the conventional method, 66 the E VB and E CB for 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composite are calculated to be about 2.17 0.23 and 1.23 0.15 eV (Table S3).Supposing that the possible band bending is neglected 53 and given that the difference values (Dvalue) between CB and E F of g-C 3 N 4 as well as D-values between VB and E F of BiOI remain unchanged for pre-and after-contacting, the VB potential of g-C 3 N 4 in the composite is 2.65 eV and the CB potential of BiOI in the composite is -1.04 eV.The corresponding band structure diagram can thus be schemed and a staggered band alignment heterostructure is constructed, as shown in Figure 9. The direction of the photogenerated charge across the heterojunctions for the synthesized materials can be inferred by coupling the experimental results with the established band alignment (Figure 10).In the present study, the p-type BiOI was deposited on the n-type g-C 3 N 4 surface and the p-n junctions were formed at the interfacial phases, resulting in inner electrical fields established in the direction from the ntype g-C 3 N 4 to p-type BiOI.When exposing to the simulated light, the VB electrons of both g-C 3 N 4 and BiOI could be excited up.The charge transfer at the interfacial phases may follow the double-transfer mechanism 353637 or Z-scheme transfer mode. 3If the double-transfer mechanism is adopted, the reduction reaction would proceed on the CB of g-C 3 N 4 , as well as the oxidation reaction on the VB of BiOI (Figure 10a).According to above results, CO has been produced over 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 under 400-800 nm irradiation with 65 mWcm -2 (Table 2).The contract experiment was carried out under the similar conditions, except the light source using 485-515 nm.Since the specific light excites BiOI solely, the photogenerated electrons would transfer from the CB of BiOI to that of g-C 3 N 4 for CO 2 reduction.No products were detected and hence, the hypothesis of the double-transfer mechanism is invalid.From the enhanced photocatalytic activity, we assume that the charge transfer of the synthesized BiOI/g-C3N4 catalysts takes Zscheme mode under our experimental conditions. To give powerful supports to Z-scheme mode, a series of comparative experiments were conducted using EDTA as scavenging agent to eliminate the photogenerated holes in the process of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.Figure 11 shows the yields of CO, CH 4 , H 2 , and O 2 for the mixtures of the typical 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 catalyst with EDTA after running different times.In comparison with normal catalysts (Figure 7), the H 2 yield has no visible change but the yields of CO and CH 4 have a distinct increase.More obviously, the generation of O 2 is suppressed completely.All these results can be ascribed to the effect of adding EDTA.With the addition of EDTA, the photogenerated holes are scavenged, resulting in more efficient separation of the photogenerated electrons and holes.Ultimately, the generation of O 2 is hindered while the yields of CO and CH 4 are enhanced. On the other hand, the Z-scheme charge transfer would be broken with the addition of the scavenger.In consideration of the extremely reversibility of the I 3 -/I -pair, as demonstrated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests (Figure S13), we suppose that the I 3 -ions act as the electron carriers in the process of the photogenerated electron transfer across the p-n junctions.In this case, the generation of intermediate I 3 -ions was blocked as the scavenger is mixed.The corresponding contrast tests show that the peak at 108 cm -1 in the Raman spectra after different cycles disappeared (Figure S14), implying that the photogenerated electrons across the heterojunction are indeed through the transmitting role of the intermediate I 3 -ions.Under light irradiation, the I -ions near the p-n junctions are oxidized to I 3 -ions by the photogenerated holes of BiOI and simultaneously, the I 3 -ions could be reduced by the photogenerated electrons from g-C 3 N 4 , resulting in the efficient separation of the photogenerated holes and electrons on the side of g-C 3 N 4 and BiOI, respectively.When the holes were scavenged, there will be no I 3 -ions detectable.In order to further confirm the role of the intermediate I 3 ions, we construct Bi 5 O 7 I/g-C 3 N 4 and Bi 2 O 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composites to investigate the effect of the content of I element on the CO 2 reduction.The results show that the reduction of I content in the composite is unfavorable for the reduction of CO 2 (Table S4), implying that the I 3 -intermediate plays an important role in the charge transfer process. Consequently, we conclude that it is the very reversibility of the I 3 -/I -pairs that accelerates the photoinduced electrons and holes quenching consecutively at the interfacial phase and finally, achieves Z-scheme transfer. To provide convincing evidence for the efficient separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, we recorded transient photocurrent responses of pure materials and 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composites over 15 on-off irradiation cycles.Figure 12 shows a comparison of I-t curves for BiOI, g-C 3 N 4 , and 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composite.The photocurrent response of the composite material can reproducibly increase under each irradiation and quickly recover in the dark.Moreover, the photocurrent responses of the composite increase significantly in comparison with those of pure materials, indicating the higher separation efficiency of electron-hole pairs under simulated solar-light irradiation.Besides, the PL spectra of the BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composite photocatalysts at an excitation wavelength of 365 nm were measured and presented in Figure S15.The results show that that the emission intensity of the composites distinctly decreased weakest intensity at x 7.4, indicating that the efficient separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. 67n the basis of the above XPS and Raman results as well as the powerful evidence from transient photocurrent and photoluminescence spectra, we conclude that the charge transfer mode for the synthesized photocatalysts is in accordance well with the process shown in Figure 10b and the x-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composites are a new type of indirect solidstate Z-scheme photocatalyst, which conducts the photogenerated electrons across the interfacial phase through the intermediate I 3 -/I -pairs.3.6.Possible Photocatalytic Mechanism.According to the confirmed charge transfer mode and the detected intermediates, the mechanism of CO 2 reduction is proposed as follows: (2) (3) (5) Since the CB potential of the composites is more negative than that of CO 2 /CO (-0.53 V), H 2 O/H 2 (-0.41 V), and CO 2 /CH 4 (-0.24V) pairs, CO 2 can be reduced to yield CO, H 2 , and CH 4 thermodynamically. 2 However, the generation of CH 4 is more difficult than that of CO because the formation of CO requires 2H /2e -, while the formation of CH 4 needs 8H / 8e -.Therefore, the photoreduction of CO 2 to CO is dynamically favored processes in reality.Under stronger illuminating light intensity, more photogenerated electrons are excited and bigger electron density is obtained on the CB of BiOI side in the composite through the intermediate I 3 -/I - pairs.As a result, not only are CO yields increased but also CH 4 release is added (Table 1). Besides the photogenerated electrons, the role of the concomitantly photogenerated holes cannot be ignored.The holes may react with the adsorbed water molecules to generate oxygen, hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) or hydroxide radicals ( OH) 5 The detection of the intermediate product H 2 O 2 as well as the O 2 yield lower than theoretical value has confirmed experimentally the correctness of the above mechanism.Considering that the VB of the prepared composite catalysts (E VB 2.17 0.23 V) is located below the oxidation potential of water (E (H 2 O/ OH) 2.32 V), the formation of hydroxyl radicals is a thermodynamically favored process.To verify the existence of hydroxyl radicals, PL method was applied by the using TA as a probe molecule. 49Figure S16 presents the PL spectral change of the photocatalysts in the solution of TAOH after different time of illumination.An obvious increase of PL intensity at 425 nm is observed with the extension of the irradiation time.The results show that the hydroxyl radicals are actually generated in the catalytic process and participate in the photocatalytic reactions. The detection of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) and hydroxide radicals has confirmed experimentally the correctness of the above mechanism of CO 2 reduction."}, {"llm generation": "BiOI", "source": "Figure 4 shows the UV-Vis adsorption spectra of pure BiOI, g-C 3 N 4 and x-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composites.", "context": "3.1.Structure and Morphology.The XRD patterns of pure g-C 3 N 4 , pure BiOI and x-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composites are displayed in Figure 1.Two characteristic peaks of pure g-C 3 N 4 are observed at 27.5and 13.1, which can be indexed to (002) and (100) diffraction planes, respectively.The strong XRD peak at 27.5is indicative of the interplanar stacking of aromatic systems with a distance of 0.326 nm, while the latter with a much weaker intensity at 13.1is attributed to in-plane repeating units with a period of 0.675 nm. 50The two diffraction peaks are in good agreement with those of other reported g-C 3 N 4 . 47Pure BiOI is in its tetragonal phase (PDF No. 00-010-0445) and exhibits several strong peaks at 29.6, 31.6,45.4, and 55.2.For the x-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composites, all the XRD patterns could be well indexed to g-C 3 N 4 and tetragonal phase of BiOI.In addition, the intensities of diffraction peaks of g-C 3 N 4 become weaker, while those of BiOI become stronger with the increase of the contents of BiOI.When the amount of BiOI is lower than 5.2 wt, the characteristic peaks of BiOI is not found, which may be attributed to lower detectable limit of instrument or to BiOI highly dispersed on the surface of g-C 3 N 4 .However, the existence of BiOI can be detected and estimated by analyses TG, as shown in Figure S1. It is worth noting that an extra peak at 12.2is observed for 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 .The peak can be ascribed to (0 0 1) plane of BiOI phase (PDF No: 01-085-0863).This phase of BiOI, similar to the former phase, has a 2D structure along c axial, and crystallizes in the Tetragonal space group P4/nmm.The difference between the two phase is the length of c axis, which deceases from 9.14 A for the former to 7.21 A for the later.The appearance of the later may be attributed to the (001) plane of BiOI coupling with g-C 3 N 4 , leading to the interaction force between BiOI and g-C 3 N 4 strengthening and as a result, the ratio of the later phase increases.The subsequent weakening of the peak may be due to the agglomerate of BiOI (Figure S6). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out to elucidate the surface composition and the chemical states of the elements.The survey XPS spectrum for 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 indicates that the composite mainly consists of C, N, Bi, I, and O atoms, which are well consistent with the chemical compositions (Figure S2).To gain more insight into the chemical bonding between the carbon and nitrogen atoms in the composite, the high resolution XPS spectra of C 1s and N 1s were deconvoluted by Gaussian-Lorenzian analysis method.For C 1s spectra (Figure 2a), two distinct peaks at 284.8 and 288.0 eV and a low intensity peak at 286.0 eV are observed.The first peak is attributed to sp 2 C-C bonds, and the second one is sp 2 hybridized carbon in N-containing aromatic ring (N-CN), 51,52 while the last peak with low intensity at around 286.0 eV may be ascribed to the C-NH 2 species on the g-C 3 N 4 . 52For N 1s spectra (Figure 2b), four fitted peaks are observed to locate at around 398.3, 399.4,400.7, and 403.9 eV, respectively.These peaks can be regarded as the sp 2 hybridized nitrogen involved in triazine rings (C-NC), the tertiary nitrogen N-(C) 3 groups, the free amino groups (C-N-H), and -excitations, respectively. 24Compared with pure g-C 3 N 4 , N 1s peaks except the -excitation one have about 0.4 shifts to higher binding energies.By contrast, the deconvoluted C 1s peaks have only a slight shift. To further probe the chemical states of Bi and I elements, the high resolution Bi 4f and I 3d XPS spectra for pure BiOI and 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 material were also deconvoluted by curve fitting method.Two strong peaks at 164.3 and 159.0 eV as well as two satellite peaks at 165.4 and 160.0 eV were detected in the composite, as shown in Figure 2c.The strong peaks, lower than those of pure BiOI, are attributed to the characteristic of Bi 4f 5/2 and Bi 4f 7/2 of Bi(III), as reported in other BiOI-based system. 53Similar shifts are also observed in the high-resolution I 3d spectra (Figure 2d).Two conspicuous peaks are available at binding energies of 618.3 eV for I 3d 5/2 and 629.8 eV for I 3d 3/2 , 54 both of which have a shift of 0.5-0.6 eV to low energy region compared with those of pure BiOI. The O 1s peak (Figure S3) was deconvoluted into three components, centered at 529.2, 531.9, and 533.4 eV, respectively.Two peaks at around 531.9 and 533.4 eV are related to absorbed H 2 O molecule and hydroxyl group on the surface. 55,56The lowest binding energy of O 1s at 529.2 eV is regarded as the Bi-O bond in Bi 2 O 2 slabs of BiOI, 57 which has about 0.4 shifts to low binding energies compared with that of pure BiOI.All the shifts for binding energy in the XPS spectra can be attributed to the intense interaction between closely contacted phases of BiOI and g-C 3 N 4 , implying that the hetero junctions have been formed in the as-synthesized composite. 58EM was used to investigate the morphology and microstructure of the synthesized catalysts.Figure 3 shows the TEM images of g-C 3 N 4 and the typical 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composite.It can be seen that the morphology of pure g-C 3 N 4 (Figure 3a) shows a characteristic crumpled layered structure.For the composite, it is observed that BiOI particles are uniformly deposited on the surface of g-C 3 N 4 (Figure 3b).To observe more clearly the microstructure of the composite, the highresolution TEM image of area e in Figure 3b is shown in Figure 3c.A lattice spacing of 0.301 nm is determined, which is attributed to the (102) facet of BiOI.The lattice fringes of g-C 3 N 4 , however, are not observed clearly due to its weak crystallization.Nevertheless, the EDX pattern of area k contains C, N, O, and Cu elements, while that of area m includes not only C, N, O, and Cu elements but also Bi and I (Figure 3d and3e).The results show that the area m is composed of g-C 3 N 4 and BiOI, implying that BiOI is closely deposited on the surface of g-C 3 N 4 layer in this region.To further explore the detailed elemental distributions, energy mappings of N, Bi, and I over the 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 were constructed (in Figure S4).All elements were uniformly distributed on composite, as confirmed by area elemental detection.From the element mapping analysis, it is observed that BiOI could be uniformly deposited on the entire surface of the g-C 3 N 4 . 3.2.UV-Vis DRS Spectra. Figure 4 shows the UV-Vis adsorption spectra of pure BiOI, g-C 3 N 4 and x-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composites.It is obvious that the absorption wavelengths of pure BiOI, g-C 3 N 4 and all the composites display distinct absorption in the visible-light region.Additionally, the absorption edge of the composites shifts regularly to long wavelength with increasing of BiOI content.The band gaps (E g ) of pure materials were estimated by the plot of (h) 1/2 versus photo energy (h) (Figure S5), considering that both BiOI 59 and g-C 3 N 4 10 are indirect band gap semiconductors.The calculated band gaps of BiOI and g-C 3 N 4 are 1.75 and 2.69 eV, respectively, which agrees well with that of the reported BiOI 60 and g-C 3 N 4 . 61.4.Photocatalytic Performance.The photoreduction CO 2 activities of the prepared photocatalysts were evaluated in the presence of water vapor under visible light irradiation.Figure 5 shows the CO 2 photoreduction yields for the assynthesized composites after 5 h irradiation.The photocatalytic products for pure g-C 3 N 4 include CO, H 2 , and O 2 , while there are no products detectable for pure BiOI.With the increase of the BiOI content in the composites, the yields of H 2 decrease monotonously while those of CO and O 2 increase and reach the maximal yields of 17.9 and 9.8 molg cat -1 , respectively, at 7.4 wt.No other products such as HCOOH, HCHO, or CH 3 OH were detected by either GC or GC-MS analyses.Besides, CH 4 , as a minor product, was detected for the composites with BiOI contents of 5.2, 7.4, and 10.1 wt.The generation of the products may be explained by the formation of heterojunctions between g-C 3 N 4 and BiOI in the composites.With the increase of the BiOI contents, the heterojunctions increase, resulting in the improvement of the yield rates of CO, CH 4 , and O 2 .When the BiOI contents get too high, the BiOI morphology is varied from lamella to the hierarchical microsphere and the specific surface area of the composites decrease (Figure S6 andS7).The efficient heterojunction interface did not increase distinctly whereas the excessive BiOI with narrow band gap would act as the recombination center of photogenerated electrons and holes. 36hus, the drop of the productivity should be ascribed to the decreasing the separation efficiency of electron-hole pairs. Figure 6 shows the photocatalytic CO 2 activities for the optimal 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 sample.As can be seen, the total yields of CH 4 , CO, H 2 , and O 2 are enhanced with the extension of the irradiation time.However, the maximal yield rates of CO, CH 4 and O 2 are found at 3 h irradiation, which attained 4.86, 0.18, and 2.78 molg cat -1 h -1 , respectively (Figure S8).The reduction of the photocatalytic activity may be ascribed to the negative effect of the produced hydrogen peroxide, as shown below. The effect of light intensity and light wavelength on the photoreduction CO 2 activity for 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 catalyst were also investigated and the results are summarized in Table 1.The product yields of CO 2 reduction increase not too much as the wavelength of irradiation light extending from 400-800 to 320-800 nm, probably due to its VLD property of the synthesized composite.Nevertheless, the yields of products, including CH 4 , H 2 , O 2 , and CO, increase with the intensity of illuminating light.As a result, the molar ratio of CH 4 /CO grows from 0 to 7.92 when the light intensity increases from 65 to 260 mWcm -2 .This can be explained in terms of the requisite electron number of generating different products.Consequently, the generation of the CO 2 reduction products is mainly dependent on the intensity of the illumination light. To confirm the role of the heterojunctions, the photocatalytic activity of CO 2 reduction of the mechanical mixtures as contrasts were measured and the results are summarized in Table S2.The yields of CO, CH 4 , and O 2 for the mechanically mixed samples decrease greatly in comparison to their counterparts, indicating that the loosely contacted interfaces are insufficient for photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .Thus, it may be reasonably deduced that the formation of heterojunctions between the interfacial phases are responsible for the enhanced photocatalytic activity of the synthesized composites.To further verify the effect of the heterojunctions, we used g-C 3 N 4 , 2.5-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 , and 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 as catalysts to contrast their photocatalytic activity under different atmosphere (Table 2).Under N 2 /H 2 O atmosphere, the products for all the samples are H 2 and O 2 , and the yields of which decrease with increasing the BiOI contents.When N 2 is replaced by CO 2 , the yields of CO or CH 4 increase with BiOI content, accompanying with the yields of H 2 deceased regularly.The results show that the reaction of CO 2 reduction is competitive to that of H 2 generation and the formation of the heterojunctions is more favorable for CO 2 reduction. On the other hand, we notice that the yield of O 2 for all the composites is lower than that expected whether in N 2 /H 2 O or in CO 2 /H 2 O atmosphere.The discrepancy between the practical yields and the calculated values may be attributed to the kinetically competitive reactions of two-electron water oxidation to hydrogen peroxide. 62To check the existence of the intermediate Reproducibility and durability are critical issues for the longterm use of a catalyst in practical application.In the durability tests, the photoreduction CO 2 of the typical 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 catalyst was repeated for five times, as shown in Figure 7.The results show that the yields of CO, CH 4 , H 2 and O 2 decreased slightly after five cycles.To illustrate the stability of the catalyst, XPS spectra measurements were applied for detecting the change of the chemical composition.It can be seen that the high resolution XPS spectra of C 1s, N 1s, and Bi 4f for 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 after five cycles maintain their peak positions as before reaction, while a small amount of I 3 -ions at 619.1 eV, 63 probably deriving from the oxidation of I -ions, could be identified (Figure S10).To further confirm the existence of I 3 ions, Raman spectra were measured.An obvious peak at 108 cm -1 in Raman spectra becomes stronger gradually, indicating the accumulation of I 3 -ions with recycling (Figure S11). 63Therefore, we assume that it is the accumulation of the -ions that results in the reduction of the recycling performance of the materials.Except for the negative effect, we assume that the detected I 3 -ions play a crucial role on the transfer of the photogenerated electrons across the heterojunctions, as shown below. 3.5.Determination of the Charge Transfer Mode.The band edge positions of the composites are known to influence directly on the reduction and oxidation reactions occurring at the catalyst surface.The band energy alignment of the typical 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composite is determined by combining UPS with XPS and DRS. Figure 8 shows the UPS spectra of g-C 3 N 4 , BiOI, and 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 measured at sample biases (-8.0 V).The valence band position (VB) of pure g-C 3 N 4 was first estimated to be situated at -6.61 eV (vs vacuum), according to the linear intersection method. 64The work function of g-C 3 N 4 was calculated to be 4.18 eV (vs vacuum) and the corresponding Fermi level (E F ) to be -4.18eV (vs vacuum).Considering that the band gap (E g ) of pure g-C 3 N 4 is 2.69 eV, the conduction band position (CB) is located at ca. -3.92 eV (vs.vacuum).Correspondingly, the potentials of E VB and E CB are positioned at 2.17 and -0.52 eV (vs NHE), respectively, based on the relationship between the vacuum energy (E abs ) and the normal electrode potential (E ), E abs -E -4.44. 64imilarly, the values of E VB , E CB , and E F of BiOI are determined to be 2.42, 0.67, and 2.01 eV (vs.NHE) (Table S3). With the formation of the BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 heterostructures, alignment of the Fermi levels is assumed at the interfacial phases of two components. 36The value of apparent E F of the composite can be estimated to be 0.30 eV (vs.NHE) by linear intersection method in the UPS spectrum.Accompanying with the movement of Fermi levels, the CB and VB edge positions for both BiOI and g-C 3 N 4 are shifted upward or downward.In this case, the band offsets of 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunctions can be calculated using XPS core-level (CL) alignment method. 65The XPS core-level and valence band spectra of the pure materials and the 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 heterostructure are shown in Figures 2 andS12, respectively.According to the conventional method, 66 the E VB and E CB for 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composite are calculated to be about 2.17 0.23 and 1.23 0.15 eV (Table S3).Supposing that the possible band bending is neglected 53 and given that the difference values (Dvalue) between CB and E F of g-C 3 N 4 as well as D-values between VB and E F of BiOI remain unchanged for pre-and after-contacting, the VB potential of g-C 3 N 4 in the composite is 2.65 eV and the CB potential of BiOI in the composite is -1.04 eV.The corresponding band structure diagram can thus be schemed and a staggered band alignment heterostructure is constructed, as shown in Figure 9. The direction of the photogenerated charge across the heterojunctions for the synthesized materials can be inferred by coupling the experimental results with the established band alignment (Figure 10).In the present study, the p-type BiOI was deposited on the n-type g-C 3 N 4 surface and the p-n junctions were formed at the interfacial phases, resulting in inner electrical fields established in the direction from the ntype g-C 3 N 4 to p-type BiOI.When exposing to the simulated light, the VB electrons of both g-C 3 N 4 and BiOI could be excited up.The charge transfer at the interfacial phases may follow the double-transfer mechanism 353637 or Z-scheme transfer mode. 3If the double-transfer mechanism is adopted, the reduction reaction would proceed on the CB of g-C 3 N 4 , as well as the oxidation reaction on the VB of BiOI (Figure 10a).According to above results, CO has been produced over 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 under 400-800 nm irradiation with 65 mWcm -2 (Table 2).The contract experiment was carried out under the similar conditions, except the light source using 485-515 nm.Since the specific light excites BiOI solely, the photogenerated electrons would transfer from the CB of BiOI to that of g-C 3 N 4 for CO 2 reduction.No products were detected and hence, the hypothesis of the double-transfer mechanism is invalid.From the enhanced photocatalytic activity, we assume that the charge transfer of the synthesized BiOI/g-C3N4 catalysts takes Zscheme mode under our experimental conditions. To give powerful supports to Z-scheme mode, a series of comparative experiments were conducted using EDTA as scavenging agent to eliminate the photogenerated holes in the process of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.Figure 11 shows the yields of CO, CH 4 , H 2 , and O 2 for the mixtures of the typical 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 catalyst with EDTA after running different times.In comparison with normal catalysts (Figure 7), the H 2 yield has no visible change but the yields of CO and CH 4 have a distinct increase.More obviously, the generation of O 2 is suppressed completely.All these results can be ascribed to the effect of adding EDTA.With the addition of EDTA, the photogenerated holes are scavenged, resulting in more efficient separation of the photogenerated electrons and holes.Ultimately, the generation of O 2 is hindered while the yields of CO and CH 4 are enhanced. On the other hand, the Z-scheme charge transfer would be broken with the addition of the scavenger.In consideration of the extremely reversibility of the I 3 -/I -pair, as demonstrated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests (Figure S13), we suppose that the I 3 -ions act as the electron carriers in the process of the photogenerated electron transfer across the p-n junctions.In this case, the generation of intermediate I 3 -ions was blocked as the scavenger is mixed.The corresponding contrast tests show that the peak at 108 cm -1 in the Raman spectra after different cycles disappeared (Figure S14), implying that the photogenerated electrons across the heterojunction are indeed through the transmitting role of the intermediate I 3 -ions.Under light irradiation, the I -ions near the p-n junctions are oxidized to I 3 -ions by the photogenerated holes of BiOI and simultaneously, the I 3 -ions could be reduced by the photogenerated electrons from g-C 3 N 4 , resulting in the efficient separation of the photogenerated holes and electrons on the side of g-C 3 N 4 and BiOI, respectively.When the holes were scavenged, there will be no I 3 -ions detectable.In order to further confirm the role of the intermediate I 3 ions, we construct Bi 5 O 7 I/g-C 3 N 4 and Bi 2 O 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composites to investigate the effect of the content of I element on the CO 2 reduction.The results show that the reduction of I content in the composite is unfavorable for the reduction of CO 2 (Table S4), implying that the I 3 -intermediate plays an important role in the charge transfer process. Consequently, we conclude that it is the very reversibility of the I 3 -/I -pairs that accelerates the photoinduced electrons and holes quenching consecutively at the interfacial phase and finally, achieves Z-scheme transfer. To provide convincing evidence for the efficient separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, we recorded transient photocurrent responses of pure materials and 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composites over 15 on-off irradiation cycles.Figure 12 shows a comparison of I-t curves for BiOI, g-C 3 N 4 , and 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composite.The photocurrent response of the composite material can reproducibly increase under each irradiation and quickly recover in the dark.Moreover, the photocurrent responses of the composite increase significantly in comparison with those of pure materials, indicating the higher separation efficiency of electron-hole pairs under simulated solar-light irradiation.Besides, the PL spectra of the BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composite photocatalysts at an excitation wavelength of 365 nm were measured and presented in Figure S15.The results show that that the emission intensity of the composites distinctly decreased weakest intensity at x 7.4, indicating that the efficient separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. 67n the basis of the above XPS and Raman results as well as the powerful evidence from transient photocurrent and photoluminescence spectra, we conclude that the charge transfer mode for the synthesized photocatalysts is in accordance well with the process shown in Figure 10b and the x-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composites are a new type of indirect solidstate Z-scheme photocatalyst, which conducts the photogenerated electrons across the interfacial phase through the intermediate I 3 -/I -pairs.3.6.Possible Photocatalytic Mechanism.According to the confirmed charge transfer mode and the detected intermediates, the mechanism of CO 2 reduction is proposed as follows: (2) (3) (5) Since the CB potential of the composites is more negative than that of CO 2 /CO (-0.53 V), H 2 O/H 2 (-0.41 V), and CO 2 /CH 4 (-0.24V) pairs, CO 2 can be reduced to yield CO, H 2 , and CH 4 thermodynamically. 2 However, the generation of CH 4 is more difficult than that of CO because the formation of CO requires 2H /2e -, while the formation of CH 4 needs 8H / 8e -.Therefore, the photoreduction of CO 2 to CO is dynamically favored processes in reality.Under stronger illuminating light intensity, more photogenerated electrons are excited and bigger electron density is obtained on the CB of BiOI side in the composite through the intermediate I 3 -/I - pairs.As a result, not only are CO yields increased but also CH 4 release is added (Table 1). Besides the photogenerated electrons, the role of the concomitantly photogenerated holes cannot be ignored.The holes may react with the adsorbed water molecules to generate oxygen, hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) or hydroxide radicals ( OH) 5 The detection of the intermediate product H 2 O 2 as well as the O 2 yield lower than theoretical value has confirmed experimentally the correctness of the above mechanism.Considering that the VB of the prepared composite catalysts (E VB 2.17 0.23 V) is located below the oxidation potential of water (E (H 2 O/ OH) 2.32 V), the formation of hydroxyl radicals is a thermodynamically favored process.To verify the existence of hydroxyl radicals, PL method was applied by the using TA as a probe molecule. 49Figure S16 presents the PL spectral change of the photocatalysts in the solution of TAOH after different time of illumination.An obvious increase of PL intensity at 425 nm is observed with the extension of the irradiation time.The results show that the hydroxyl radicals are actually generated in the catalytic process and participate in the photocatalytic reactions.

It is worth noting that an extra peak at 12.2is observed for 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 .The peak can be ascribed to (0 0 1) plane of BiOI phase (PDF No: 01-085-0863).This phase of BiOI, similar to the former phase, has a 2D structure along c axial, and crystallizes in the Tetragonal space group P4/nmm.The difference between the two phase is the length of c axis, which deceases from 9.14 A for the former to 7.21 A for the later.The appearance of the later may be attributed to the (001) plane of BiOI coupling with g-C 3 N 4 , leading to the interaction force between BiOI and g-C 3 N 4 strengthening and as a result, the ratio of the later phase increases.The subsequent weakening of the peak may be due to the agglomerate of BiOI (Figure S6). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out to elucidate the surface composition and the chemical states of the elements.The survey XPS spectrum for 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 indicates that the composite mainly consists of C, N, Bi, I, and O atoms, which are well consistent with the chemical compositions (Figure S2).To gain more insight into the chemical bonding between the carbon and nitrogen atoms in the composite, the high resolution XPS spectra of C 1s and N 1s were deconvoluted by Gaussian-Lorenzian analysis method.For C 1s spectra (Figure 2a), two distinct peaks at 284.8 and 288.0 eV and a low intensity peak at 286.0 eV are observed.The first peak is attributed to sp 2 C-C bonds, and the second one is sp 2 hybridized carbon in N-containing aromatic ring (N-CN), 51,52 while the last peak with low intensity at around 286.0 eV may be ascribed to the C-NH 2 species on the g-C 3 N 4 . 52For N 1s spectra (Figure 2b), four fitted peaks are observed to locate at around 398.3, 399.4,400.7, and 403.9 eV, respectively.These peaks can be regarded as the sp 2 hybridized nitrogen involved in triazine rings (C-NC), the tertiary nitrogen N-(C) 3 groups, the free amino groups (C-N-H), and -excitations, respectively. 24Compared with pure g-C 3 N 4 , N 1s peaks except the -excitation one have about 0.4 shifts to higher binding energies.By contrast, the deconvoluted C 1s peaks have only a slight shift. To further probe the chemical states of Bi and I elements, the high resolution Bi 4f and I 3d XPS spectra for pure BiOI and 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 material were also deconvoluted by curve fitting method.Two strong peaks at 164.3 and 159.0 eV as well as two satellite peaks at 165.4 and 160.0 eV were detected in the composite, as shown in Figure 2c.The strong peaks, lower than those of pure BiOI, are attributed to the characteristic of Bi 4f 5/2 and Bi 4f 7/2 of Bi(III), as reported in other BiOI-based system. 53Similar shifts are also observed in the high-resolution I 3d spectra (Figure 2d).Two conspicuous peaks are available at binding energies of 618.3 eV for I 3d 5/2 and 629.8 eV for I 3d 3/2 , 54 both of which have a shift of 0.5-0.6 eV to low energy region compared with those of pure BiOI. The O 1s peak (Figure S3) was deconvoluted into three components, centered at 529.2, 531.9, and 533.4 eV, respectively.Two peaks at around 531.9 and 533.4 eV are related to absorbed H 2 O molecule and hydroxyl group on the surface. 55,56The lowest binding energy of O 1s at 529.2 eV is regarded as the Bi-O bond in Bi 2 O 2 slabs of BiOI, 57 which has about 0.4 shifts to low binding energies compared with that of pure BiOI.All the shifts for binding energy in the XPS spectra can be attributed to the intense interaction between closely contacted phases of BiOI and g-C 3 N 4 , implying that the hetero junctions have been formed in the as-synthesized composite. 58EM was used to investigate the morphology and microstructure of the synthesized catalysts.Figure 3 shows the TEM images of g-C 3 N 4 and the typical 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composite.It can be seen that the morphology of pure g-C 3 N 4 (Figure 3a) shows a characteristic crumpled layered structure.For the composite, it is observed that BiOI particles are uniformly deposited on the surface of g-C 3 N 4 (Figure 3b).To observe more clearly the microstructure of the composite, the highresolution TEM image of area e in Figure 3b is shown in Figure 3c.A lattice spacing of 0.301 nm is determined, which is attributed to the (102) facet of BiOI.The lattice fringes of g-C 3 N 4 , however, are not observed clearly due to its weak crystallization.Nevertheless, the EDX pattern of area k contains C, N, O, and Cu elements, while that of area m includes not only C, N, O, and Cu elements but also Bi and I (Figure 3d and3e).The results show that the area m is composed of g-C 3 N 4 and BiOI, implying that BiOI is closely deposited on the surface of g-C 3 N 4 layer in this region.To further explore the detailed elemental distributions, energy mappings of N, Bi, and I over the 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 were constructed (in Figure S4).All elements were uniformly distributed on composite, as confirmed by area elemental detection.From the element mapping analysis, it is observed that BiOI could be uniformly deposited on the entire surface of the g-C 3 N 4 . 3.2.UV-Vis DRS Spectra. Figure 4 shows the UV-Vis adsorption spectra of pure BiOI, g-C 3 N 4 and x-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composites.It is obvious that the absorption wavelengths of pure BiOI, g-C 3 N 4 and all the composites display distinct absorption in the visible-light region.Additionally, the absorption edge of the composites shifts regularly to long wavelength with increasing of BiOI content.The band gaps (E g ) of pure materials were estimated by the plot of (h) 1/2 versus photo energy (h) (Figure S5), considering that both BiOI 59 and g-C 3 N 4 10 are indirect band gap semiconductors.The calculated band gaps of BiOI and g-C 3 N 4 are 1.75 and 2.69 eV, respectively, which agrees well with that of the reported BiOI 60 and g-C 3 N 4 . 61.4.Photocatalytic Performance.The photoreduction CO 2 activities of the prepared photocatalysts were evaluated in the presence of water vapor under visible light irradiation.Figure 5 shows the CO 2 photoreduction yields for the assynthesized composites after 5 h irradiation.The photocatalytic products for pure g-C 3 N 4 include CO, H 2 , and O 2 , while there are no products detectable for pure BiOI.With the increase of the BiOI content in the composites, the yields of H 2 decrease monotonously while those of CO and O 2 increase and reach the maximal yields of 17.9 and 9.8 molg cat -1 , respectively, at 7.4 wt.No other products such as HCOOH, HCHO, or CH 3 OH were detected by either GC or GC-MS analyses.Besides, CH 4 , as a minor product, was detected for the composites with BiOI contents of 5.2, 7.4, and 10.1 wt.The generation of the products may be explained by the formation of heterojunctions between g-C 3 N 4 and BiOI in the composites.With the increase of the BiOI contents, the heterojunctions increase, resulting in the improvement of the yield rates of CO, CH 4 , and O 2 .When the BiOI contents get too high, the BiOI morphology is varied from lamella to the hierarchical microsphere and the specific surface area of the composites decrease (Figure S6 andS7).The efficient heterojunction interface did not increase distinctly whereas the excessive BiOI with narrow band gap would act as the recombination center of photogenerated electrons and holes. 36hus, the drop of the productivity should be ascribed to the decreasing the separation efficiency of electron-hole pairs. Figure 6 shows the photocatalytic CO 2 activities for the optimal 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 sample.As can be seen, the total yields of CH 4 , CO, H 2 , and O 2 are enhanced with the extension of the irradiation time.However, the maximal yield rates of CO, CH 4 and O 2 are found at 3 h irradiation, which attained 4.86, 0.18, and 2.78 molg cat -1 h -1 , respectively (Figure S8).The reduction of the photocatalytic activity may be ascribed to the negative effect of the produced hydrogen peroxide, as shown below. The effect of light intensity and light wavelength on the photoreduction CO 2 activity for 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 catalyst were also investigated and the results are summarized in Table 1.The product yields of CO 2 reduction increase not too much as the wavelength of irradiation light extending from 400-800 to 320-800 nm, probably due to its VLD property of the synthesized composite.Nevertheless, the yields of products, including CH 4 , H 2 , O 2 , and CO, increase with the intensity of illuminating light.As a result, the molar ratio of CH 4 /CO grows from 0 to 7.92 when the light intensity increases from 65 to 260 mWcm -2 .This can be explained in terms of the requisite electron number of generating different products.Consequently, the generation of the CO 2 reduction products is mainly dependent on the intensity of the illumination light. To confirm the role of the heterojunctions, the photocatalytic activity of CO 2 reduction of the mechanical mixtures as contrasts were measured and the results are summarized in Table S2.The yields of CO, CH 4 , and O 2 for the mechanically mixed samples decrease greatly in comparison to their counterparts, indicating that the loosely contacted interfaces are insufficient for photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .Thus, it may be reasonably deduced that the formation of heterojunctions between the interfacial phases are responsible for the enhanced photocatalytic activity of the synthesized composites.To further verify the effect of the heterojunctions, we used g-C 3 N 4 , 2.5-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 , and 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 as catalysts to contrast their photocatalytic activity under different atmosphere (Table 2).Under N 2 /H 2 O atmosphere, the products for all the samples are H 2 and O 2 , and the yields of which decrease with increasing the BiOI contents.When N 2 is replaced by CO 2 , the yields of CO or CH 4 increase with BiOI content, accompanying with the yields of H 2 deceased regularly.The results show that the reaction of CO 2 reduction is competitive to that of H 2 generation and the formation of the heterojunctions is more favorable for CO 2 reduction. On the other hand, we notice that the yield of O 2 for all the composites is lower than that expected whether in N 2 /H 2 O or in CO 2 /H 2 O atmosphere.The discrepancy between the practical yields and the calculated values may be attributed to the kinetically competitive reactions of two-electron water oxidation to hydrogen peroxide. 62To check the existence of the intermediate Reproducibility and durability are critical issues for the longterm use of a catalyst in practical application.In the durability tests, the photoreduction CO 2 of the typical 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 catalyst was repeated for five times, as shown in Figure 7.The results show that the yields of CO, CH 4 , H 2 and O 2 decreased slightly after five cycles.To illustrate the stability of the catalyst, XPS spectra measurements were applied for detecting the change of the chemical composition.It can be seen that the high resolution XPS spectra of C 1s, N 1s, and Bi 4f for 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 after five cycles maintain their peak positions as before reaction, while a small amount of I 3 -ions at 619.1 eV, 63 probably deriving from the oxidation of I -ions, could be identified (Figure S10).To further confirm the existence of I 3 ions, Raman spectra were measured.An obvious peak at 108 cm -1 in Raman spectra becomes stronger gradually, indicating the accumulation of I 3 -ions with recycling (Figure S11). 63Therefore, we assume that it is the accumulation of the -ions that results in the reduction of the recycling performance of the materials.Except for the negative effect, we assume that the detected I 3 -ions play a crucial role on the transfer of the photogenerated electrons across the heterojunctions, as shown below. 3.5.Determination of the Charge Transfer Mode.The band edge positions of the composites are known to influence directly on the reduction and oxidation reactions occurring at the catalyst surface.The band energy alignment of the typical 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composite is determined by combining UPS with XPS and DRS. Figure 8 shows the UPS spectra of g-C 3 N 4 , BiOI, and 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 measured at sample biases (-8.0 V).The valence band position (VB) of pure g-C 3 N 4 was first estimated to be situated at -6.61 eV (vs vacuum), according to the linear intersection method. 64The work function of g-C 3 N 4 was calculated to be 4.18 eV (vs vacuum) and the corresponding Fermi level (E F ) to be -4.18eV (vs vacuum).Considering that the band gap (E g ) of pure g-C 3 N 4 is 2.69 eV, the conduction band position (CB) is located at ca. -3.92 eV (vs.vacuum).Correspondingly, the potentials of E VB and E CB are positioned at 2.17 and -0.52 eV (vs NHE), respectively, based on the relationship between the vacuum energy (E abs ) and the normal electrode potential (E ), E abs -E -4.44. 64imilarly, the values of E VB , E CB , and E F of BiOI are determined to be 2.42, 0.67, and 2.01 eV (vs.NHE) (Table S3). With the formation of the BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 heterostructures, alignment of the Fermi levels is assumed at the interfacial phases of two components. 36The value of apparent E F of the composite can be estimated to be 0.30 eV (vs.NHE) by linear intersection method in the UPS spectrum.Accompanying with the movement of Fermi levels, the CB and VB edge positions for both BiOI and g-C 3 N 4 are shifted upward or downward.In this case, the band offsets of 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunctions can be calculated using XPS core-level (CL) alignment method. 65The XPS core-level and valence band spectra of the pure materials and the 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 heterostructure are shown in Figures 2 andS12, respectively.According to the conventional method, 66 the E VB and E CB for 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composite are calculated to be about 2.17 0.23 and 1.23 0.15 eV (Table S3).Supposing that the possible band bending is neglected 53 and given that the difference values (Dvalue) between CB and E F of g-C 3 N 4 as well as D-values between VB and E F of BiOI remain unchanged for pre-and after-contacting, the VB potential of g-C 3 N 4 in the composite is 2.65 eV and the CB potential of BiOI in the composite is -1.04 eV.The corresponding band structure diagram can thus be schemed and a staggered band alignment heterostructure is constructed, as shown in Figure 9. The direction of the photogenerated charge across the heterojunctions for the synthesized materials can be inferred by coupling the experimental results with the established band alignment (Figure 10).In the present study, the p-type BiOI was deposited on the n-type g-C 3 N 4 surface and the p-n junctions were formed at the interfacial phases, resulting in inner electrical fields established in the direction from the ntype g-C 3 N 4 to p-type BiOI.When exposing to the simulated light, the VB electrons of both g-C 3 N 4 and BiOI could be excited up.The charge transfer at the interfacial phases may follow the double-transfer mechanism 353637 or Z-scheme transfer mode. 3If the double-transfer mechanism is adopted, the reduction reaction would proceed on the CB of g-C 3 N 4 , as well as the oxidation reaction on the VB of BiOI (Figure 10a).According to above results, CO has been produced over 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 under 400-800 nm irradiation with 65 mWcm -2 (Table 2).The contract experiment was carried out under the similar conditions, except the light source using 485-515 nm.Since the specific light excites BiOI solely, the photogenerated electrons would transfer from the CB of BiOI to that of g-C 3 N 4 for CO 2 reduction.No products were detected and hence, the hypothesis of the double-transfer mechanism is invalid.From the enhanced photocatalytic activity, we assume that the charge transfer of the synthesized BiOI/g-C3N4 catalysts takes Zscheme mode under our experimental conditions. To give powerful supports to Z-scheme mode, a series of comparative experiments were conducted using EDTA as scavenging agent to eliminate the photogenerated holes in the process of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.Figure 11 shows the yields of CO, CH 4 , H 2 , and O 2 for the mixtures of the typical 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 catalyst with EDTA after running different times.In comparison with normal catalysts (Figure 7), the H 2 yield has no visible change but the yields of CO and CH 4 have a distinct increase.More obviously, the generation of O 2 is suppressed completely.All these results can be ascribed to the effect of adding EDTA.With the addition of EDTA, the photogenerated holes are scavenged, resulting in more efficient separation of the photogenerated electrons and holes.Ultimately, the generation of O 2 is hindered while the yields of CO and CH 4 are enhanced. On the other hand, the Z-scheme charge transfer would be broken with the addition of the scavenger.In consideration of the extremely reversibility of the I 3 -/I -pair, as demonstrated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests (Figure S13), we suppose that the I 3 -ions act as the electron carriers in the process of the photogenerated electron transfer across the p-n junctions.In this case, the generation of intermediate I 3 -ions was blocked as the scavenger is mixed.The corresponding contrast tests show that the peak at 108 cm -1 in the Raman spectra after different cycles disappeared (Figure S14), implying that the photogenerated electrons across the heterojunction are indeed through the transmitting role of the intermediate I 3 -ions.Under light irradiation, the I -ions near the p-n junctions are oxidized to I 3 -ions by the photogenerated holes of BiOI and simultaneously, the I 3 -ions could be reduced by the photogenerated electrons from g-C 3 N 4 , resulting in the efficient separation of the photogenerated holes and electrons on the side of g-C 3 N 4 and BiOI, respectively.When the holes were scavenged, there will be no I 3 -ions detectable.In order to further confirm the role of the intermediate I 3 ions, we construct Bi 5 O 7 I/g-C 3 N 4 and Bi 2 O 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composites to investigate the effect of the content of I element on the CO 2 reduction.The results show that the reduction of I content in the composite is unfavorable for the reduction of CO 2 (Table S4), implying that the I 3 -intermediate plays an important role in the charge transfer process. Consequently, we conclude that it is the very reversibility of the I 3 -/I -pairs that accelerates the photoinduced electrons and holes quenching consecutively at the interfacial phase and finally, achieves Z-scheme transfer. To provide convincing evidence for the efficient separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, we recorded transient photocurrent responses of pure materials and 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composites over 15 on-off irradiation cycles.Figure 12 shows a comparison of I-t curves for BiOI, g-C 3 N 4 , and 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composite.The photocurrent response of the composite material can reproducibly increase under each irradiation and quickly recover in the dark.Moreover, the photocurrent responses of the composite increase significantly in comparison with those of pure materials, indicating the higher separation efficiency of electron-hole pairs under simulated solar-light irradiation.Besides, the PL spectra of the BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composite photocatalysts at an excitation wavelength of 365 nm were measured and presented in Figure S15.The results show that that the emission intensity of the composites distinctly decreased weakest intensity at x 7.4, indicating that the efficient separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. 67n the basis of the above XPS and Raman results as well as the powerful evidence from transient photocurrent and photoluminescence spectra, we conclude that the charge transfer mode for the synthesized photocatalysts is in accordance well with the process shown in Figure 10b and the x-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composites are a new type of indirect solidstate Z-scheme photocatalyst, which conducts the photogenerated electrons across the interfacial phase through the intermediate I 3 -/I -pairs.3.6.Possible Photocatalytic Mechanism.According to the confirmed charge transfer mode and the detected intermediates, the mechanism of CO 2 reduction is proposed as follows: (2) (3) (5) Since the CB potential of the composites is more negative than that of CO 2 /CO (-0.53 V), H 2 O/H 2 (-0.41 V), and CO 2 /CH 4 (-0.24V) pairs, CO 2 can be reduced to yield CO, H 2 , and CH 4 thermodynamically. 2 However, the generation of CH 4 is more difficult than that of CO because the formation of CO requires 2H /2e -, while the formation of CH 4 needs 8H / 8e -.Therefore, the photoreduction of CO 2 to CO is dynamically favored processes in reality.Under stronger illuminating light intensity, more photogenerated electrons are excited and bigger electron density is obtained on the CB of BiOI side in the composite through the intermediate I 3 -/I - pairs.As a result, not only are CO yields increased but also CH 4 release is added (Table 1). Besides the photogenerated electrons, the role of the concomitantly photogenerated holes cannot be ignored.The holes may react with the adsorbed water molecules to generate oxygen, hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) or hydroxide radicals ( OH) 5 The detection of the intermediate product H 2 O 2 as well as the O 2 yield lower than theoretical value has confirmed experimentally the correctness of the above mechanism.Considering that the VB of the prepared composite catalysts (E VB 2.17 0.23 V) is located below the oxidation potential of water (E (H 2 O/ OH) 2.32 V), the formation of hydroxyl radicals is a thermodynamically favored process.To verify the existence of hydroxyl radicals, PL method was applied by the using TA as a probe molecule. 49Figure S16 presents the PL spectral change of the photocatalysts in the solution of TAOH after different time of illumination.An obvious increase of PL intensity at 425 nm is observed with the extension of the irradiation time.The results show that the hydroxyl radicals are actually generated in the catalytic process and participate in the photocatalytic reactions. The detection of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) and hydroxide radicals has confirmed experimentally the correctness of the above mechanism of CO 2 reduction."}, {"llm generation": "x-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalysts, 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composite, pure BiOI, g-C 3 N 4", "source": "A series of x-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalysts were synthesized by a simple deposition method.The optimal 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composite is proven to be good photocatalyst for CO 2 reduction and exhibits more efficient photocatalytic performance than pure BiOI and g-C 3 N 4 under visible light ( 400 nm).", "context": "A series of x-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalysts were synthesized by a simple deposition method.The optimal 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composite is proven to be good photocatalyst for CO 2 reduction and exhibits more efficient photocatalytic performance than pure BiOI and g-C 3 N 4 under visible light ( 400 nm).The enhanced photoactivity is attributed to the efficient separation of the photogenerated charge carriers.An indirect Z-scheme charge transfer mode is demonstrated by checking the redox I 3 -/I -pair.On the basis of the final products and the intermediate OH and H 2 O 2 , a potential mechanism is further proposed.In summary, the present research is expected to be useful in developing Z-scheme photocatalysts and provide some meaningful information for deep understanding how the photogenerated electrons transfer across the solid-solid contact interface.

H 2 O 2 , we measured the typical absorption peak of H 2 O 2 at 447 nm using UV-vis spectroscopy.The variance of the absorption peaks with the reaction time confirms the generation of the intermediate, as shown in Figure S9.The existence of the intermediate H 2 O 2 could hinder the adsorption of CO 2 or H 2 O and occupy photocatalytic reaction centers, resulting in deactivation of the composites under the continuous irradiation.Besides, H 2 O 2 makes the release of O 2 to be delayed, leading to the yield of O 2 reduced.

Chemical components and valence states were analyzed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) on a Thermo Scientific ESCALab 250Xi Spectrometer with Al K radiation as the excitation source.Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) data was obtained with HeI (21.22 eV) as monochromatic light source.UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were performed on a scan UV-vis spectrometer (Cary 5000) with integrating sphere detector.The Raman spectra were obtained using a Renishaw inVia spectrophotometer.Photoelectrochemical tests in a conventional three-electrode system were recorded by a CHI 660E electrochemical workstation (Chenhua, Shanghai, China).The photocurrents of the photocatalysts were measured at 0.0 V (vs.Ag/AgCl) in Na 2 SO 4 aqueous solution under UV-visible light with AM 1.5 filter after being purged by N 2 to remove O 2 . 2.3.Photocatalytic Performance Tests.Photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction of the synthesized catalysts was evaluated in gaseous phase in a stainless steel cylindrical vessel with 15 cm length and 180 mL volume.The light source was a 300 W xenon arc lamp (PLS-SXE 300, Beijing Trust tech Co. Ltd., China) with a UV cutoff filter ( 400 nm).The catalyst powders (0.10 g) were first dispersed on a circular glass dish equipped with a quartz window for passing light irradiation.Prior to photoreduction experiments, the reaction setup was vacuum-treated and then, high purity CO 2 gas (99.995) as purging and reaction gas was introduced into the reaction system for several times.The compressed high purity CO 2 gas was passed through a water bubbler to generate a mixture of CO 2 and H 2 O vapor.The distance between the sample and the light source was fixed at 11 or 30 cm to tune the irradiate intensity.After illumination, the gaseous products from the reactor were quantifiably identified for offline analysis using a GC-7890II gas chromatograph (Techcomp Corp., China) equipped with a flame ionized detector (FID) and GC-MS (Agilent 7890A-5975C) with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD).The equipped columns were TDX-01 and Porapak-Q, respectively.Other hydrocarbons were analyzed by GC-MS equipped with a DB-FFAP capillary column. Blank tests were also conducted in the absence of photocatalysts or in the dark with catalysts.No product was detected, indicating that the presence of both the visible-light irradiation and photocatalyst are indispensable for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with water.To evaluate the stability, sample 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 as a model was refreshed by washing with deionized water and its photocatalytic performance was reevaluated in the light of the aforementioned procedure.Simultaneously, contrast tests, including using the mechanical mixture samples or mixing the 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 sample with edetate disodium salt (EDTA) to scavenge the photogenerated holes, were carried out to prove the role of the heterojunctions or to verify the charge transfer mode experimentally. 2.4.Analysis of the Intermediate H 2 O 2 .The formation of H 2 O 2 on the photocatalysts was detected by the UV-vis spectrum using otolidine as peroxide indicator. 48It has been proved that the production of H 2 O 2 can be monitored by measuring the absorption peak of the 2electron oxidation product of o-tolidine at 447 nm.The detection procedures were similar to the above photocatalytic tests, except that the catalysts were replaced by the mixture of the catalyst and o-tolidine (1:1.2 weight ratios).Sampling was carried out at given time intervals and then, the obtained samples were dispersed in deionized water.The suspension was filtered after centrifugation and the resulting solution was set to the same condition for UV-vis spectrum measurements of the 2-electron oxidized toluidine by T6 UV-vis spectrophotometer (Purkinje General, Beijing, China). 2.5.Analysis of the Intermediate OH.The formation of hydroxyl radicals ( OH) was detected by the PL technique using terephthalic acid (TA) as a probe molecule.It has been proven that TA reacts readily with OH to produce 2-hydroxyterephthalic acid (TAOH) with a typical fluorescent signal at 425 nm, and the intensity of the TAOH peak is proportional to the amount of hydroxyl radicals formed. 49The detection procedures were similar to the photocatalytic experiments, except that the catalysts were replaced by the mixture of the catalyst and TA (1:1.2 weight ratio).Sampling was carried out at given irradiation time intervals, and then, the obtained samples were dispersed in water.The resulting solution after centrifugal separation was set to a same concentration for fluorescence spectral measurements.The PL peak of TAOH at 425 nm was detected using a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Hitachi F-7000) with excitation at 315 nm."}, {"llm generation": "visible light", "source": "The photoreduction CO 2 activities of the prepared photocatalysts were evaluated in the presence of water vapor under visible light irradiation.", "context": "3.1.Structure and Morphology.The XRD patterns of pure g-C 3 N 4 , pure BiOI and x-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composites are displayed in Figure 1.Two characteristic peaks of pure g-C 3 N 4 are observed at 27.5and 13.1, which can be indexed to (002) and (100) diffraction planes, respectively.The strong XRD peak at 27.5is indicative of the interplanar stacking of aromatic systems with a distance of 0.326 nm, while the latter with a much weaker intensity at 13.1is attributed to in-plane repeating units with a period of 0.675 nm. 50The two diffraction peaks are in good agreement with those of other reported g-C 3 N 4 . 47Pure BiOI is in its tetragonal phase (PDF No. 00-010-0445) and exhibits several strong peaks at 29.6, 31.6,45.4, and 55.2.For the x-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composites, all the XRD patterns could be well indexed to g-C 3 N 4 and tetragonal phase of BiOI.In addition, the intensities of diffraction peaks of g-C 3 N 4 become weaker, while those of BiOI become stronger with the increase of the contents of BiOI.When the amount of BiOI is lower than 5.2 wt, the characteristic peaks of BiOI is not found, which may be attributed to lower detectable limit of instrument or to BiOI highly dispersed on the surface of g-C 3 N 4 .However, the existence of BiOI can be detected and estimated by analyses TG, as shown in Figure S1. It is worth noting that an extra peak at 12.2is observed for 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 .The peak can be ascribed to (0 0 1) plane of BiOI phase (PDF No: 01-085-0863).This phase of BiOI, similar to the former phase, has a 2D structure along c axial, and crystallizes in the Tetragonal space group P4/nmm.The difference between the two phase is the length of c axis, which deceases from 9.14 A for the former to 7.21 A for the later.The appearance of the later may be attributed to the (001) plane of BiOI coupling with g-C 3 N 4 , leading to the interaction force between BiOI and g-C 3 N 4 strengthening and as a result, the ratio of the later phase increases.The subsequent weakening of the peak may be due to the agglomerate of BiOI (Figure S6). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out to elucidate the surface composition and the chemical states of the elements.The survey XPS spectrum for 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 indicates that the composite mainly consists of C, N, Bi, I, and O atoms, which are well consistent with the chemical compositions (Figure S2).To gain more insight into the chemical bonding between the carbon and nitrogen atoms in the composite, the high resolution XPS spectra of C 1s and N 1s were deconvoluted by Gaussian-Lorenzian analysis method.For C 1s spectra (Figure 2a), two distinct peaks at 284.8 and 288.0 eV and a low intensity peak at 286.0 eV are observed.The first peak is attributed to sp 2 C-C bonds, and the second one is sp 2 hybridized carbon in N-containing aromatic ring (N-CN), 51,52 while the last peak with low intensity at around 286.0 eV may be ascribed to the C-NH 2 species on the g-C 3 N 4 . 52For N 1s spectra (Figure 2b), four fitted peaks are observed to locate at around 398.3, 399.4,400.7, and 403.9 eV, respectively.These peaks can be regarded as the sp 2 hybridized nitrogen involved in triazine rings (C-NC), the tertiary nitrogen N-(C) 3 groups, the free amino groups (C-N-H), and -excitations, respectively. 24Compared with pure g-C 3 N 4 , N 1s peaks except the -excitation one have about 0.4 shifts to higher binding energies.By contrast, the deconvoluted C 1s peaks have only a slight shift. To further probe the chemical states of Bi and I elements, the high resolution Bi 4f and I 3d XPS spectra for pure BiOI and 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 material were also deconvoluted by curve fitting method.Two strong peaks at 164.3 and 159.0 eV as well as two satellite peaks at 165.4 and 160.0 eV were detected in the composite, as shown in Figure 2c.The strong peaks, lower than those of pure BiOI, are attributed to the characteristic of Bi 4f 5/2 and Bi 4f 7/2 of Bi(III), as reported in other BiOI-based system. 53Similar shifts are also observed in the high-resolution I 3d spectra (Figure 2d).Two conspicuous peaks are available at binding energies of 618.3 eV for I 3d 5/2 and 629.8 eV for I 3d 3/2 , 54 both of which have a shift of 0.5-0.6 eV to low energy region compared with those of pure BiOI. The O 1s peak (Figure S3) was deconvoluted into three components, centered at 529.2, 531.9, and 533.4 eV, respectively.Two peaks at around 531.9 and 533.4 eV are related to absorbed H 2 O molecule and hydroxyl group on the surface. 55,56The lowest binding energy of O 1s at 529.2 eV is regarded as the Bi-O bond in Bi 2 O 2 slabs of BiOI, 57 which has about 0.4 shifts to low binding energies compared with that of pure BiOI.All the shifts for binding energy in the XPS spectra can be attributed to the intense interaction between closely contacted phases of BiOI and g-C 3 N 4 , implying that the hetero junctions have been formed in the as-synthesized composite. 58EM was used to investigate the morphology and microstructure of the synthesized catalysts.Figure 3 shows the TEM images of g-C 3 N 4 and the typical 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composite.It can be seen that the morphology of pure g-C 3 N 4 (Figure 3a) shows a characteristic crumpled layered structure.For the composite, it is observed that BiOI particles are uniformly deposited on the surface of g-C 3 N 4 (Figure 3b).To observe more clearly the microstructure of the composite, the highresolution TEM image of area e in Figure 3b is shown in Figure 3c.A lattice spacing of 0.301 nm is determined, which is attributed to the (102) facet of BiOI.The lattice fringes of g-C 3 N 4 , however, are not observed clearly due to its weak crystallization.Nevertheless, the EDX pattern of area k contains C, N, O, and Cu elements, while that of area m includes not only C, N, O, and Cu elements but also Bi and I (Figure 3d and3e).The results show that the area m is composed of g-C 3 N 4 and BiOI, implying that BiOI is closely deposited on the surface of g-C 3 N 4 layer in this region.To further explore the detailed elemental distributions, energy mappings of N, Bi, and I over the 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 were constructed (in Figure S4).All elements were uniformly distributed on composite, as confirmed by area elemental detection.From the element mapping analysis, it is observed that BiOI could be uniformly deposited on the entire surface of the g-C 3 N 4 . 3.2.UV-Vis DRS Spectra. Figure 4 shows the UV-Vis adsorption spectra of pure BiOI, g-C 3 N 4 and x-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composites.It is obvious that the absorption wavelengths of pure BiOI, g-C 3 N 4 and all the composites display distinct absorption in the visible-light region.Additionally, the absorption edge of the composites shifts regularly to long wavelength with increasing of BiOI content.The band gaps (E g ) of pure materials were estimated by the plot of (h) 1/2 versus photo energy (h) (Figure S5), considering that both BiOI 59 and g-C 3 N 4 10 are indirect band gap semiconductors.The calculated band gaps of BiOI and g-C 3 N 4 are 1.75 and 2.69 eV, respectively, which agrees well with that of the reported BiOI 60 and g-C 3 N 4 . 61.4.Photocatalytic Performance.The photoreduction CO 2 activities of the prepared photocatalysts were evaluated in the presence of water vapor under visible light irradiation.Figure 5 shows the CO 2 photoreduction yields for the assynthesized composites after 5 h irradiation.The photocatalytic products for pure g-C 3 N 4 include CO, H 2 , and O 2 , while there are no products detectable for pure BiOI.With the increase of the BiOI content in the composites, the yields of H 2 decrease monotonously while those of CO and O 2 increase and reach the maximal yields of 17.9 and 9.8 molg cat -1 , respectively, at 7.4 wt.No other products such as HCOOH, HCHO, or CH 3 OH were detected by either GC or GC-MS analyses.Besides, CH 4 , as a minor product, was detected for the composites with BiOI contents of 5.2, 7.4, and 10.1 wt.The generation of the products may be explained by the formation of heterojunctions between g-C 3 N 4 and BiOI in the composites.With the increase of the BiOI contents, the heterojunctions increase, resulting in the improvement of the yield rates of CO, CH 4 , and O 2 .When the BiOI contents get too high, the BiOI morphology is varied from lamella to the hierarchical microsphere and the specific surface area of the composites decrease (Figure S6 andS7).The efficient heterojunction interface did not increase distinctly whereas the excessive BiOI with narrow band gap would act as the recombination center of photogenerated electrons and holes. 36hus, the drop of the productivity should be ascribed to the decreasing the separation efficiency of electron-hole pairs. Figure 6 shows the photocatalytic CO 2 activities for the optimal 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 sample.As can be seen, the total yields of CH 4 , CO, H 2 , and O 2 are enhanced with the extension of the irradiation time.However, the maximal yield rates of CO, CH 4 and O 2 are found at 3 h irradiation, which attained 4.86, 0.18, and 2.78 molg cat -1 h -1 , respectively (Figure S8).The reduction of the photocatalytic activity may be ascribed to the negative effect of the produced hydrogen peroxide, as shown below. The effect of light intensity and light wavelength on the photoreduction CO 2 activity for 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 catalyst were also investigated and the results are summarized in Table 1.The product yields of CO 2 reduction increase not too much as the wavelength of irradiation light extending from 400-800 to 320-800 nm, probably due to its VLD property of the synthesized composite.Nevertheless, the yields of products, including CH 4 , H 2 , O 2 , and CO, increase with the intensity of illuminating light.As a result, the molar ratio of CH 4 /CO grows from 0 to 7.92 when the light intensity increases from 65 to 260 mWcm -2 .This can be explained in terms of the requisite electron number of generating different products.Consequently, the generation of the CO 2 reduction products is mainly dependent on the intensity of the illumination light. To confirm the role of the heterojunctions, the photocatalytic activity of CO 2 reduction of the mechanical mixtures as contrasts were measured and the results are summarized in Table S2.The yields of CO, CH 4 , and O 2 for the mechanically mixed samples decrease greatly in comparison to their counterparts, indicating that the loosely contacted interfaces are insufficient for photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .Thus, it may be reasonably deduced that the formation of heterojunctions between the interfacial phases are responsible for the enhanced photocatalytic activity of the synthesized composites.To further verify the effect of the heterojunctions, we used g-C 3 N 4 , 2.5-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 , and 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 as catalysts to contrast their photocatalytic activity under different atmosphere (Table 2).Under N 2 /H 2 O atmosphere, the products for all the samples are H 2 and O 2 , and the yields of which decrease with increasing the BiOI contents.When N 2 is replaced by CO 2 , the yields of CO or CH 4 increase with BiOI content, accompanying with the yields of H 2 deceased regularly.The results show that the reaction of CO 2 reduction is competitive to that of H 2 generation and the formation of the heterojunctions is more favorable for CO 2 reduction. On the other hand, we notice that the yield of O 2 for all the composites is lower than that expected whether in N 2 /H 2 O or in CO 2 /H 2 O atmosphere.The discrepancy between the practical yields and the calculated values may be attributed to the kinetically competitive reactions of two-electron water oxidation to hydrogen peroxide. 62To check the existence of the intermediate Reproducibility and durability are critical issues for the longterm use of a catalyst in practical application.In the durability tests, the photoreduction CO 2 of the typical 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 catalyst was repeated for five times, as shown in Figure 7.The results show that the yields of CO, CH 4 , H 2 and O 2 decreased slightly after five cycles.To illustrate the stability of the catalyst, XPS spectra measurements were applied for detecting the change of the chemical composition.It can be seen that the high resolution XPS spectra of C 1s, N 1s, and Bi 4f for 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 after five cycles maintain their peak positions as before reaction, while a small amount of I 3 -ions at 619.1 eV, 63 probably deriving from the oxidation of I -ions, could be identified (Figure S10).To further confirm the existence of I 3 ions, Raman spectra were measured.An obvious peak at 108 cm -1 in Raman spectra becomes stronger gradually, indicating the accumulation of I 3 -ions with recycling (Figure S11). 63Therefore, we assume that it is the accumulation of the -ions that results in the reduction of the recycling performance of the materials.Except for the negative effect, we assume that the detected I 3 -ions play a crucial role on the transfer of the photogenerated electrons across the heterojunctions, as shown below. 3.5.Determination of the Charge Transfer Mode.The band edge positions of the composites are known to influence directly on the reduction and oxidation reactions occurring at the catalyst surface.The band energy alignment of the typical 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composite is determined by combining UPS with XPS and DRS. Figure 8 shows the UPS spectra of g-C 3 N 4 , BiOI, and 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 measured at sample biases (-8.0 V).The valence band position (VB) of pure g-C 3 N 4 was first estimated to be situated at -6.61 eV (vs vacuum), according to the linear intersection method. 64The work function of g-C 3 N 4 was calculated to be 4.18 eV (vs vacuum) and the corresponding Fermi level (E F ) to be -4.18eV (vs vacuum).Considering that the band gap (E g ) of pure g-C 3 N 4 is 2.69 eV, the conduction band position (CB) is located at ca. -3.92 eV (vs.vacuum).Correspondingly, the potentials of E VB and E CB are positioned at 2.17 and -0.52 eV (vs NHE), respectively, based on the relationship between the vacuum energy (E abs ) and the normal electrode potential (E ), E abs -E -4.44. 64imilarly, the values of E VB , E CB , and E F of BiOI are determined to be 2.42, 0.67, and 2.01 eV (vs.NHE) (Table S3). With the formation of the BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 heterostructures, alignment of the Fermi levels is assumed at the interfacial phases of two components. 36The value of apparent E F of the composite can be estimated to be 0.30 eV (vs.NHE) by linear intersection method in the UPS spectrum.Accompanying with the movement of Fermi levels, the CB and VB edge positions for both BiOI and g-C 3 N 4 are shifted upward or downward.In this case, the band offsets of 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunctions can be calculated using XPS core-level (CL) alignment method. 65The XPS core-level and valence band spectra of the pure materials and the 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 heterostructure are shown in Figures 2 andS12, respectively.According to the conventional method, 66 the E VB and E CB for 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composite are calculated to be about 2.17 0.23 and 1.23 0.15 eV (Table S3).Supposing that the possible band bending is neglected 53 and given that the difference values (Dvalue) between CB and E F of g-C 3 N 4 as well as D-values between VB and E F of BiOI remain unchanged for pre-and after-contacting, the VB potential of g-C 3 N 4 in the composite is 2.65 eV and the CB potential of BiOI in the composite is -1.04 eV.The corresponding band structure diagram can thus be schemed and a staggered band alignment heterostructure is constructed, as shown in Figure 9. The direction of the photogenerated charge across the heterojunctions for the synthesized materials can be inferred by coupling the experimental results with the established band alignment (Figure 10).In the present study, the p-type BiOI was deposited on the n-type g-C 3 N 4 surface and the p-n junctions were formed at the interfacial phases, resulting in inner electrical fields established in the direction from the ntype g-C 3 N 4 to p-type BiOI.When exposing to the simulated light, the VB electrons of both g-C 3 N 4 and BiOI could be excited up.The charge transfer at the interfacial phases may follow the double-transfer mechanism 353637 or Z-scheme transfer mode. 3If the double-transfer mechanism is adopted, the reduction reaction would proceed on the CB of g-C 3 N 4 , as well as the oxidation reaction on the VB of BiOI (Figure 10a).According to above results, CO has been produced over 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 under 400-800 nm irradiation with 65 mWcm -2 (Table 2).The contract experiment was carried out under the similar conditions, except the light source using 485-515 nm.Since the specific light excites BiOI solely, the photogenerated electrons would transfer from the CB of BiOI to that of g-C 3 N 4 for CO 2 reduction.No products were detected and hence, the hypothesis of the double-transfer mechanism is invalid.From the enhanced photocatalytic activity, we assume that the charge transfer of the synthesized BiOI/g-C3N4 catalysts takes Zscheme mode under our experimental conditions. To give powerful supports to Z-scheme mode, a series of comparative experiments were conducted using EDTA as scavenging agent to eliminate the photogenerated holes in the process of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.Figure 11 shows the yields of CO, CH 4 , H 2 , and O 2 for the mixtures of the typical 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 catalyst with EDTA after running different times.In comparison with normal catalysts (Figure 7), the H 2 yield has no visible change but the yields of CO and CH 4 have a distinct increase.More obviously, the generation of O 2 is suppressed completely.All these results can be ascribed to the effect of adding EDTA.With the addition of EDTA, the photogenerated holes are scavenged, resulting in more efficient separation of the photogenerated electrons and holes.Ultimately, the generation of O 2 is hindered while the yields of CO and CH 4 are enhanced. On the other hand, the Z-scheme charge transfer would be broken with the addition of the scavenger.In consideration of the extremely reversibility of the I 3 -/I -pair, as demonstrated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests (Figure S13), we suppose that the I 3 -ions act as the electron carriers in the process of the photogenerated electron transfer across the p-n junctions.In this case, the generation of intermediate I 3 -ions was blocked as the scavenger is mixed.The corresponding contrast tests show that the peak at 108 cm -1 in the Raman spectra after different cycles disappeared (Figure S14), implying that the photogenerated electrons across the heterojunction are indeed through the transmitting role of the intermediate I 3 -ions.Under light irradiation, the I -ions near the p-n junctions are oxidized to I 3 -ions by the photogenerated holes of BiOI and simultaneously, the I 3 -ions could be reduced by the photogenerated electrons from g-C 3 N 4 , resulting in the efficient separation of the photogenerated holes and electrons on the side of g-C 3 N 4 and BiOI, respectively.When the holes were scavenged, there will be no I 3 -ions detectable.In order to further confirm the role of the intermediate I 3 ions, we construct Bi 5 O 7 I/g-C 3 N 4 and Bi 2 O 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composites to investigate the effect of the content of I element on the CO 2 reduction.The results show that the reduction of I content in the composite is unfavorable for the reduction of CO 2 (Table S4), implying that the I 3 -intermediate plays an important role in the charge transfer process. Consequently, we conclude that it is the very reversibility of the I 3 -/I -pairs that accelerates the photoinduced electrons and holes quenching consecutively at the interfacial phase and finally, achieves Z-scheme transfer. To provide convincing evidence for the efficient separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, we recorded transient photocurrent responses of pure materials and 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composites over 15 on-off irradiation cycles.Figure 12 shows a comparison of I-t curves for BiOI, g-C 3 N 4 , and 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composite.The photocurrent response of the composite material can reproducibly increase under each irradiation and quickly recover in the dark.Moreover, the photocurrent responses of the composite increase significantly in comparison with those of pure materials, indicating the higher separation efficiency of electron-hole pairs under simulated solar-light irradiation.Besides, the PL spectra of the BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composite photocatalysts at an excitation wavelength of 365 nm were measured and presented in Figure S15.The results show that that the emission intensity of the composites distinctly decreased weakest intensity at x 7.4, indicating that the efficient separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. 67n the basis of the above XPS and Raman results as well as the powerful evidence from transient photocurrent and photoluminescence spectra, we conclude that the charge transfer mode for the synthesized photocatalysts is in accordance well with the process shown in Figure 10b and the x-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composites are a new type of indirect solidstate Z-scheme photocatalyst, which conducts the photogenerated electrons across the interfacial phase through the intermediate I 3 -/I -pairs.3.6.Possible Photocatalytic Mechanism.According to the confirmed charge transfer mode and the detected intermediates, the mechanism of CO 2 reduction is proposed as follows: (2) (3) (5) Since the CB potential of the composites is more negative than that of CO 2 /CO (-0.53 V), H 2 O/H 2 (-0.41 V), and CO 2 /CH 4 (-0.24V) pairs, CO 2 can be reduced to yield CO, H 2 , and CH 4 thermodynamically. 2 However, the generation of CH 4 is more difficult than that of CO because the formation of CO requires 2H /2e -, while the formation of CH 4 needs 8H / 8e -.Therefore, the photoreduction of CO 2 to CO is dynamically favored processes in reality.Under stronger illuminating light intensity, more photogenerated electrons are excited and bigger electron density is obtained on the CB of BiOI side in the composite through the intermediate I 3 -/I - pairs.As a result, not only are CO yields increased but also CH 4 release is added (Table 1). Besides the photogenerated electrons, the role of the concomitantly photogenerated holes cannot be ignored.The holes may react with the adsorbed water molecules to generate oxygen, hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) or hydroxide radicals ( OH) 5 The detection of the intermediate product H 2 O 2 as well as the O 2 yield lower than theoretical value has confirmed experimentally the correctness of the above mechanism.Considering that the VB of the prepared composite catalysts (E VB 2.17 0.23 V) is located below the oxidation potential of water (E (H 2 O/ OH) 2.32 V), the formation of hydroxyl radicals is a thermodynamically favored process.To verify the existence of hydroxyl radicals, PL method was applied by the using TA as a probe molecule. 49Figure S16 presents the PL spectral change of the photocatalysts in the solution of TAOH after different time of illumination.An obvious increase of PL intensity at 425 nm is observed with the extension of the irradiation time.The results show that the hydroxyl radicals are actually generated in the catalytic process and participate in the photocatalytic reactions. The detection of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) and hydroxide radicals has confirmed experimentally the correctness of the above mechanism of CO 2 reduction."}, {"llm generation": "485-515 nm (Monochromatic)", "source": "The contract experiment was carried out under the similar conditions, except the light source using 485-515 nm.", "context": "3.1.Structure and Morphology.The XRD patterns of pure g-C 3 N 4 , pure BiOI and x-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composites are displayed in Figure 1.Two characteristic peaks of pure g-C 3 N 4 are observed at 27.5and 13.1, which can be indexed to (002) and (100) diffraction planes, respectively.The strong XRD peak at 27.5is indicative of the interplanar stacking of aromatic systems with a distance of 0.326 nm, while the latter with a much weaker intensity at 13.1is attributed to in-plane repeating units with a period of 0.675 nm. 50The two diffraction peaks are in good agreement with those of other reported g-C 3 N 4 . 47Pure BiOI is in its tetragonal phase (PDF No. 00-010-0445) and exhibits several strong peaks at 29.6, 31.6,45.4, and 55.2.For the x-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composites, all the XRD patterns could be well indexed to g-C 3 N 4 and tetragonal phase of BiOI.In addition, the intensities of diffraction peaks of g-C 3 N 4 become weaker, while those of BiOI become stronger with the increase of the contents of BiOI.When the amount of BiOI is lower than 5.2 wt, the characteristic peaks of BiOI is not found, which may be attributed to lower detectable limit of instrument or to BiOI highly dispersed on the surface of g-C 3 N 4 .However, the existence of BiOI can be detected and estimated by analyses TG, as shown in Figure S1. It is worth noting that an extra peak at 12.2is observed for 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 .The peak can be ascribed to (0 0 1) plane of BiOI phase (PDF No: 01-085-0863).This phase of BiOI, similar to the former phase, has a 2D structure along c axial, and crystallizes in the Tetragonal space group P4/nmm.The difference between the two phase is the length of c axis, which deceases from 9.14 A for the former to 7.21 A for the later.The appearance of the later may be attributed to the (001) plane of BiOI coupling with g-C 3 N 4 , leading to the interaction force between BiOI and g-C 3 N 4 strengthening and as a result, the ratio of the later phase increases.The subsequent weakening of the peak may be due to the agglomerate of BiOI (Figure S6). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out to elucidate the surface composition and the chemical states of the elements.The survey XPS spectrum for 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 indicates that the composite mainly consists of C, N, Bi, I, and O atoms, which are well consistent with the chemical compositions (Figure S2).To gain more insight into the chemical bonding between the carbon and nitrogen atoms in the composite, the high resolution XPS spectra of C 1s and N 1s were deconvoluted by Gaussian-Lorenzian analysis method.For C 1s spectra (Figure 2a), two distinct peaks at 284.8 and 288.0 eV and a low intensity peak at 286.0 eV are observed.The first peak is attributed to sp 2 C-C bonds, and the second one is sp 2 hybridized carbon in N-containing aromatic ring (N-CN), 51,52 while the last peak with low intensity at around 286.0 eV may be ascribed to the C-NH 2 species on the g-C 3 N 4 . 52For N 1s spectra (Figure 2b), four fitted peaks are observed to locate at around 398.3, 399.4,400.7, and 403.9 eV, respectively.These peaks can be regarded as the sp 2 hybridized nitrogen involved in triazine rings (C-NC), the tertiary nitrogen N-(C) 3 groups, the free amino groups (C-N-H), and -excitations, respectively. 24Compared with pure g-C 3 N 4 , N 1s peaks except the -excitation one have about 0.4 shifts to higher binding energies.By contrast, the deconvoluted C 1s peaks have only a slight shift. To further probe the chemical states of Bi and I elements, the high resolution Bi 4f and I 3d XPS spectra for pure BiOI and 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 material were also deconvoluted by curve fitting method.Two strong peaks at 164.3 and 159.0 eV as well as two satellite peaks at 165.4 and 160.0 eV were detected in the composite, as shown in Figure 2c.The strong peaks, lower than those of pure BiOI, are attributed to the characteristic of Bi 4f 5/2 and Bi 4f 7/2 of Bi(III), as reported in other BiOI-based system. 53Similar shifts are also observed in the high-resolution I 3d spectra (Figure 2d).Two conspicuous peaks are available at binding energies of 618.3 eV for I 3d 5/2 and 629.8 eV for I 3d 3/2 , 54 both of which have a shift of 0.5-0.6 eV to low energy region compared with those of pure BiOI. The O 1s peak (Figure S3) was deconvoluted into three components, centered at 529.2, 531.9, and 533.4 eV, respectively.Two peaks at around 531.9 and 533.4 eV are related to absorbed H 2 O molecule and hydroxyl group on the surface. 55,56The lowest binding energy of O 1s at 529.2 eV is regarded as the Bi-O bond in Bi 2 O 2 slabs of BiOI, 57 which has about 0.4 shifts to low binding energies compared with that of pure BiOI.All the shifts for binding energy in the XPS spectra can be attributed to the intense interaction between closely contacted phases of BiOI and g-C 3 N 4 , implying that the hetero junctions have been formed in the as-synthesized composite. 58EM was used to investigate the morphology and microstructure of the synthesized catalysts.Figure 3 shows the TEM images of g-C 3 N 4 and the typical 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composite.It can be seen that the morphology of pure g-C 3 N 4 (Figure 3a) shows a characteristic crumpled layered structure.For the composite, it is observed that BiOI particles are uniformly deposited on the surface of g-C 3 N 4 (Figure 3b).To observe more clearly the microstructure of the composite, the highresolution TEM image of area e in Figure 3b is shown in Figure 3c.A lattice spacing of 0.301 nm is determined, which is attributed to the (102) facet of BiOI.The lattice fringes of g-C 3 N 4 , however, are not observed clearly due to its weak crystallization.Nevertheless, the EDX pattern of area k contains C, N, O, and Cu elements, while that of area m includes not only C, N, O, and Cu elements but also Bi and I (Figure 3d and3e).The results show that the area m is composed of g-C 3 N 4 and BiOI, implying that BiOI is closely deposited on the surface of g-C 3 N 4 layer in this region.To further explore the detailed elemental distributions, energy mappings of N, Bi, and I over the 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 were constructed (in Figure S4).All elements were uniformly distributed on composite, as confirmed by area elemental detection.From the element mapping analysis, it is observed that BiOI could be uniformly deposited on the entire surface of the g-C 3 N 4 . 3.2.UV-Vis DRS Spectra. Figure 4 shows the UV-Vis adsorption spectra of pure BiOI, g-C 3 N 4 and x-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composites.It is obvious that the absorption wavelengths of pure BiOI, g-C 3 N 4 and all the composites display distinct absorption in the visible-light region.Additionally, the absorption edge of the composites shifts regularly to long wavelength with increasing of BiOI content.The band gaps (E g ) of pure materials were estimated by the plot of (h) 1/2 versus photo energy (h) (Figure S5), considering that both BiOI 59 and g-C 3 N 4 10 are indirect band gap semiconductors.The calculated band gaps of BiOI and g-C 3 N 4 are 1.75 and 2.69 eV, respectively, which agrees well with that of the reported BiOI 60 and g-C 3 N 4 . 61.4.Photocatalytic Performance.The photoreduction CO 2 activities of the prepared photocatalysts were evaluated in the presence of water vapor under visible light irradiation.Figure 5 shows the CO 2 photoreduction yields for the assynthesized composites after 5 h irradiation.The photocatalytic products for pure g-C 3 N 4 include CO, H 2 , and O 2 , while there are no products detectable for pure BiOI.With the increase of the BiOI content in the composites, the yields of H 2 decrease monotonously while those of CO and O 2 increase and reach the maximal yields of 17.9 and 9.8 molg cat -1 , respectively, at 7.4 wt.No other products such as HCOOH, HCHO, or CH 3 OH were detected by either GC or GC-MS analyses.Besides, CH 4 , as a minor product, was detected for the composites with BiOI contents of 5.2, 7.4, and 10.1 wt.The generation of the products may be explained by the formation of heterojunctions between g-C 3 N 4 and BiOI in the composites.With the increase of the BiOI contents, the heterojunctions increase, resulting in the improvement of the yield rates of CO, CH 4 , and O 2 .When the BiOI contents get too high, the BiOI morphology is varied from lamella to the hierarchical microsphere and the specific surface area of the composites decrease (Figure S6 andS7).The efficient heterojunction interface did not increase distinctly whereas the excessive BiOI with narrow band gap would act as the recombination center of photogenerated electrons and holes. 36hus, the drop of the productivity should be ascribed to the decreasing the separation efficiency of electron-hole pairs. Figure 6 shows the photocatalytic CO 2 activities for the optimal 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 sample.As can be seen, the total yields of CH 4 , CO, H 2 , and O 2 are enhanced with the extension of the irradiation time.However, the maximal yield rates of CO, CH 4 and O 2 are found at 3 h irradiation, which attained 4.86, 0.18, and 2.78 molg cat -1 h -1 , respectively (Figure S8).The reduction of the photocatalytic activity may be ascribed to the negative effect of the produced hydrogen peroxide, as shown below. The effect of light intensity and light wavelength on the photoreduction CO 2 activity for 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 catalyst were also investigated and the results are summarized in Table 1.The product yields of CO 2 reduction increase not too much as the wavelength of irradiation light extending from 400-800 to 320-800 nm, probably due to its VLD property of the synthesized composite.Nevertheless, the yields of products, including CH 4 , H 2 , O 2 , and CO, increase with the intensity of illuminating light.As a result, the molar ratio of CH 4 /CO grows from 0 to 7.92 when the light intensity increases from 65 to 260 mWcm -2 .This can be explained in terms of the requisite electron number of generating different products.Consequently, the generation of the CO 2 reduction products is mainly dependent on the intensity of the illumination light. To confirm the role of the heterojunctions, the photocatalytic activity of CO 2 reduction of the mechanical mixtures as contrasts were measured and the results are summarized in Table S2.The yields of CO, CH 4 , and O 2 for the mechanically mixed samples decrease greatly in comparison to their counterparts, indicating that the loosely contacted interfaces are insufficient for photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .Thus, it may be reasonably deduced that the formation of heterojunctions between the interfacial phases are responsible for the enhanced photocatalytic activity of the synthesized composites.To further verify the effect of the heterojunctions, we used g-C 3 N 4 , 2.5-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 , and 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 as catalysts to contrast their photocatalytic activity under different atmosphere (Table 2).Under N 2 /H 2 O atmosphere, the products for all the samples are H 2 and O 2 , and the yields of which decrease with increasing the BiOI contents.When N 2 is replaced by CO 2 , the yields of CO or CH 4 increase with BiOI content, accompanying with the yields of H 2 deceased regularly.The results show that the reaction of CO 2 reduction is competitive to that of H 2 generation and the formation of the heterojunctions is more favorable for CO 2 reduction. On the other hand, we notice that the yield of O 2 for all the composites is lower than that expected whether in N 2 /H 2 O or in CO 2 /H 2 O atmosphere.The discrepancy between the practical yields and the calculated values may be attributed to the kinetically competitive reactions of two-electron water oxidation to hydrogen peroxide. 62To check the existence of the intermediate Reproducibility and durability are critical issues for the longterm use of a catalyst in practical application.In the durability tests, the photoreduction CO 2 of the typical 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 catalyst was repeated for five times, as shown in Figure 7.The results show that the yields of CO, CH 4 , H 2 and O 2 decreased slightly after five cycles.To illustrate the stability of the catalyst, XPS spectra measurements were applied for detecting the change of the chemical composition.It can be seen that the high resolution XPS spectra of C 1s, N 1s, and Bi 4f for 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 after five cycles maintain their peak positions as before reaction, while a small amount of I 3 -ions at 619.1 eV, 63 probably deriving from the oxidation of I -ions, could be identified (Figure S10).To further confirm the existence of I 3 ions, Raman spectra were measured.An obvious peak at 108 cm -1 in Raman spectra becomes stronger gradually, indicating the accumulation of I 3 -ions with recycling (Figure S11). 63Therefore, we assume that it is the accumulation of the -ions that results in the reduction of the recycling performance of the materials.Except for the negative effect, we assume that the detected I 3 -ions play a crucial role on the transfer of the photogenerated electrons across the heterojunctions, as shown below. 3.5.Determination of the Charge Transfer Mode.The band edge positions of the composites are known to influence directly on the reduction and oxidation reactions occurring at the catalyst surface.The band energy alignment of the typical 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composite is determined by combining UPS with XPS and DRS. Figure 8 shows the UPS spectra of g-C 3 N 4 , BiOI, and 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 measured at sample biases (-8.0 V).The valence band position (VB) of pure g-C 3 N 4 was first estimated to be situated at -6.61 eV (vs vacuum), according to the linear intersection method. 64The work function of g-C 3 N 4 was calculated to be 4.18 eV (vs vacuum) and the corresponding Fermi level (E F ) to be -4.18eV (vs vacuum).Considering that the band gap (E g ) of pure g-C 3 N 4 is 2.69 eV, the conduction band position (CB) is located at ca. -3.92 eV (vs.vacuum).Correspondingly, the potentials of E VB and E CB are positioned at 2.17 and -0.52 eV (vs NHE), respectively, based on the relationship between the vacuum energy (E abs ) and the normal electrode potential (E ), E abs -E -4.44. 64imilarly, the values of E VB , E CB , and E F of BiOI are determined to be 2.42, 0.67, and 2.01 eV (vs.NHE) (Table S3). With the formation of the BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 heterostructures, alignment of the Fermi levels is assumed at the interfacial phases of two components. 36The value of apparent E F of the composite can be estimated to be 0.30 eV (vs.NHE) by linear intersection method in the UPS spectrum.Accompanying with the movement of Fermi levels, the CB and VB edge positions for both BiOI and g-C 3 N 4 are shifted upward or downward.In this case, the band offsets of 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunctions can be calculated using XPS core-level (CL) alignment method. 65The XPS core-level and valence band spectra of the pure materials and the 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 heterostructure are shown in Figures 2 andS12, respectively.According to the conventional method, 66 the E VB and E CB for 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composite are calculated to be about 2.17 0.23 and 1.23 0.15 eV (Table S3).Supposing that the possible band bending is neglected 53 and given that the difference values (Dvalue) between CB and E F of g-C 3 N 4 as well as D-values between VB and E F of BiOI remain unchanged for pre-and after-contacting, the VB potential of g-C 3 N 4 in the composite is 2.65 eV and the CB potential of BiOI in the composite is -1.04 eV.The corresponding band structure diagram can thus be schemed and a staggered band alignment heterostructure is constructed, as shown in Figure 9. The direction of the photogenerated charge across the heterojunctions for the synthesized materials can be inferred by coupling the experimental results with the established band alignment (Figure 10).In the present study, the p-type BiOI was deposited on the n-type g-C 3 N 4 surface and the p-n junctions were formed at the interfacial phases, resulting in inner electrical fields established in the direction from the ntype g-C 3 N 4 to p-type BiOI.When exposing to the simulated light, the VB electrons of both g-C 3 N 4 and BiOI could be excited up.The charge transfer at the interfacial phases may follow the double-transfer mechanism 353637 or Z-scheme transfer mode. 3If the double-transfer mechanism is adopted, the reduction reaction would proceed on the CB of g-C 3 N 4 , as well as the oxidation reaction on the VB of BiOI (Figure 10a).According to above results, CO has been produced over 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 under 400-800 nm irradiation with 65 mWcm -2 (Table 2).The contract experiment was carried out under the similar conditions, except the light source using 485-515 nm.Since the specific light excites BiOI solely, the photogenerated electrons would transfer from the CB of BiOI to that of g-C 3 N 4 for CO 2 reduction.No products were detected and hence, the hypothesis of the double-transfer mechanism is invalid.From the enhanced photocatalytic activity, we assume that the charge transfer of the synthesized BiOI/g-C3N4 catalysts takes Zscheme mode under our experimental conditions. To give powerful supports to Z-scheme mode, a series of comparative experiments were conducted using EDTA as scavenging agent to eliminate the photogenerated holes in the process of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.Figure 11 shows the yields of CO, CH 4 , H 2 , and O 2 for the mixtures of the typical 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 catalyst with EDTA after running different times.In comparison with normal catalysts (Figure 7), the H 2 yield has no visible change but the yields of CO and CH 4 have a distinct increase.More obviously, the generation of O 2 is suppressed completely.All these results can be ascribed to the effect of adding EDTA.With the addition of EDTA, the photogenerated holes are scavenged, resulting in more efficient separation of the photogenerated electrons and holes.Ultimately, the generation of O 2 is hindered while the yields of CO and CH 4 are enhanced. On the other hand, the Z-scheme charge transfer would be broken with the addition of the scavenger.In consideration of the extremely reversibility of the I 3 -/I -pair, as demonstrated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests (Figure S13), we suppose that the I 3 -ions act as the electron carriers in the process of the photogenerated electron transfer across the p-n junctions.In this case, the generation of intermediate I 3 -ions was blocked as the scavenger is mixed.The corresponding contrast tests show that the peak at 108 cm -1 in the Raman spectra after different cycles disappeared (Figure S14), implying that the photogenerated electrons across the heterojunction are indeed through the transmitting role of the intermediate I 3 -ions.Under light irradiation, the I -ions near the p-n junctions are oxidized to I 3 -ions by the photogenerated holes of BiOI and simultaneously, the I 3 -ions could be reduced by the photogenerated electrons from g-C 3 N 4 , resulting in the efficient separation of the photogenerated holes and electrons on the side of g-C 3 N 4 and BiOI, respectively.When the holes were scavenged, there will be no I 3 -ions detectable.In order to further confirm the role of the intermediate I 3 ions, we construct Bi 5 O 7 I/g-C 3 N 4 and Bi 2 O 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composites to investigate the effect of the content of I element on the CO 2 reduction.The results show that the reduction of I content in the composite is unfavorable for the reduction of CO 2 (Table S4), implying that the I 3 -intermediate plays an important role in the charge transfer process. Consequently, we conclude that it is the very reversibility of the I 3 -/I -pairs that accelerates the photoinduced electrons and holes quenching consecutively at the interfacial phase and finally, achieves Z-scheme transfer. To provide convincing evidence for the efficient separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, we recorded transient photocurrent responses of pure materials and 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composites over 15 on-off irradiation cycles.Figure 12 shows a comparison of I-t curves for BiOI, g-C 3 N 4 , and 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composite.The photocurrent response of the composite material can reproducibly increase under each irradiation and quickly recover in the dark.Moreover, the photocurrent responses of the composite increase significantly in comparison with those of pure materials, indicating the higher separation efficiency of electron-hole pairs under simulated solar-light irradiation.Besides, the PL spectra of the BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composite photocatalysts at an excitation wavelength of 365 nm were measured and presented in Figure S15.The results show that that the emission intensity of the composites distinctly decreased weakest intensity at x 7.4, indicating that the efficient separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. 67n the basis of the above XPS and Raman results as well as the powerful evidence from transient photocurrent and photoluminescence spectra, we conclude that the charge transfer mode for the synthesized photocatalysts is in accordance well with the process shown in Figure 10b and the x-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composites are a new type of indirect solidstate Z-scheme photocatalyst, which conducts the photogenerated electrons across the interfacial phase through the intermediate I 3 -/I -pairs.3.6.Possible Photocatalytic Mechanism.According to the confirmed charge transfer mode and the detected intermediates, the mechanism of CO 2 reduction is proposed as follows: (2) (3) (5) Since the CB potential of the composites is more negative than that of CO 2 /CO (-0.53 V), H 2 O/H 2 (-0.41 V), and CO 2 /CH 4 (-0.24V) pairs, CO 2 can be reduced to yield CO, H 2 , and CH 4 thermodynamically. 2 However, the generation of CH 4 is more difficult than that of CO because the formation of CO requires 2H /2e -, while the formation of CH 4 needs 8H / 8e -.Therefore, the photoreduction of CO 2 to CO is dynamically favored processes in reality.Under stronger illuminating light intensity, more photogenerated electrons are excited and bigger electron density is obtained on the CB of BiOI side in the composite through the intermediate I 3 -/I - pairs.As a result, not only are CO yields increased but also CH 4 release is added (Table 1).

It is worth noting that an extra peak at 12.2is observed for 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 .The peak can be ascribed to (0 0 1) plane of BiOI phase (PDF No: 01-085-0863).This phase of BiOI, similar to the former phase, has a 2D structure along c axial, and crystallizes in the Tetragonal space group P4/nmm.The difference between the two phase is the length of c axis, which deceases from 9.14 A for the former to 7.21 A for the later.The appearance of the later may be attributed to the (001) plane of BiOI coupling with g-C 3 N 4 , leading to the interaction force between BiOI and g-C 3 N 4 strengthening and as a result, the ratio of the later phase increases.The subsequent weakening of the peak may be due to the agglomerate of BiOI (Figure S6). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out to elucidate the surface composition and the chemical states of the elements.The survey XPS spectrum for 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 indicates that the composite mainly consists of C, N, Bi, I, and O atoms, which are well consistent with the chemical compositions (Figure S2).To gain more insight into the chemical bonding between the carbon and nitrogen atoms in the composite, the high resolution XPS spectra of C 1s and N 1s were deconvoluted by Gaussian-Lorenzian analysis method.For C 1s spectra (Figure 2a), two distinct peaks at 284.8 and 288.0 eV and a low intensity peak at 286.0 eV are observed.The first peak is attributed to sp 2 C-C bonds, and the second one is sp 2 hybridized carbon in N-containing aromatic ring (N-CN), 51,52 while the last peak with low intensity at around 286.0 eV may be ascribed to the C-NH 2 species on the g-C 3 N 4 . 52For N 1s spectra (Figure 2b), four fitted peaks are observed to locate at around 398.3, 399.4,400.7, and 403.9 eV, respectively.These peaks can be regarded as the sp 2 hybridized nitrogen involved in triazine rings (C-NC), the tertiary nitrogen N-(C) 3 groups, the free amino groups (C-N-H), and -excitations, respectively. 24Compared with pure g-C 3 N 4 , N 1s peaks except the -excitation one have about 0.4 shifts to higher binding energies.By contrast, the deconvoluted C 1s peaks have only a slight shift. To further probe the chemical states of Bi and I elements, the high resolution Bi 4f and I 3d XPS spectra for pure BiOI and 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 material were also deconvoluted by curve fitting method.Two strong peaks at 164.3 and 159.0 eV as well as two satellite peaks at 165.4 and 160.0 eV were detected in the composite, as shown in Figure 2c.The strong peaks, lower than those of pure BiOI, are attributed to the characteristic of Bi 4f 5/2 and Bi 4f 7/2 of Bi(III), as reported in other BiOI-based system. 53Similar shifts are also observed in the high-resolution I 3d spectra (Figure 2d).Two conspicuous peaks are available at binding energies of 618.3 eV for I 3d 5/2 and 629.8 eV for I 3d 3/2 , 54 both of which have a shift of 0.5-0.6 eV to low energy region compared with those of pure BiOI. The O 1s peak (Figure S3) was deconvoluted into three components, centered at 529.2, 531.9, and 533.4 eV, respectively.Two peaks at around 531.9 and 533.4 eV are related to absorbed H 2 O molecule and hydroxyl group on the surface. 55,56The lowest binding energy of O 1s at 529.2 eV is regarded as the Bi-O bond in Bi 2 O 2 slabs of BiOI, 57 which has about 0.4 shifts to low binding energies compared with that of pure BiOI.All the shifts for binding energy in the XPS spectra can be attributed to the intense interaction between closely contacted phases of BiOI and g-C 3 N 4 , implying that the hetero junctions have been formed in the as-synthesized composite. 58EM was used to investigate the morphology and microstructure of the synthesized catalysts.Figure 3 shows the TEM images of g-C 3 N 4 and the typical 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composite.It can be seen that the morphology of pure g-C 3 N 4 (Figure 3a) shows a characteristic crumpled layered structure.For the composite, it is observed that BiOI particles are uniformly deposited on the surface of g-C 3 N 4 (Figure 3b).To observe more clearly the microstructure of the composite, the highresolution TEM image of area e in Figure 3b is shown in Figure 3c.A lattice spacing of 0.301 nm is determined, which is attributed to the (102) facet of BiOI.The lattice fringes of g-C 3 N 4 , however, are not observed clearly due to its weak crystallization.Nevertheless, the EDX pattern of area k contains C, N, O, and Cu elements, while that of area m includes not only C, N, O, and Cu elements but also Bi and I (Figure 3d and3e).The results show that the area m is composed of g-C 3 N 4 and BiOI, implying that BiOI is closely deposited on the surface of g-C 3 N 4 layer in this region.To further explore the detailed elemental distributions, energy mappings of N, Bi, and I over the 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 were constructed (in Figure S4).All elements were uniformly distributed on composite, as confirmed by area elemental detection.From the element mapping analysis, it is observed that BiOI could be uniformly deposited on the entire surface of the g-C 3 N 4 . 3.2.UV-Vis DRS Spectra. Figure 4 shows the UV-Vis adsorption spectra of pure BiOI, g-C 3 N 4 and x-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composites.It is obvious that the absorption wavelengths of pure BiOI, g-C 3 N 4 and all the composites display distinct absorption in the visible-light region.Additionally, the absorption edge of the composites shifts regularly to long wavelength with increasing of BiOI content.The band gaps (E g ) of pure materials were estimated by the plot of (h) 1/2 versus photo energy (h) (Figure S5), considering that both BiOI 59 and g-C 3 N 4 10 are indirect band gap semiconductors.The calculated band gaps of BiOI and g-C 3 N 4 are 1.75 and 2.69 eV, respectively, which agrees well with that of the reported BiOI 60 and g-C 3 N 4 . 61.4.Photocatalytic Performance.The photoreduction CO 2 activities of the prepared photocatalysts were evaluated in the presence of water vapor under visible light irradiation.Figure 5 shows the CO 2 photoreduction yields for the assynthesized composites after 5 h irradiation.The photocatalytic products for pure g-C 3 N 4 include CO, H 2 , and O 2 , while there are no products detectable for pure BiOI.With the increase of the BiOI content in the composites, the yields of H 2 decrease monotonously while those of CO and O 2 increase and reach the maximal yields of 17.9 and 9.8 molg cat -1 , respectively, at 7.4 wt.No other products such as HCOOH, HCHO, or CH 3 OH were detected by either GC or GC-MS analyses.Besides, CH 4 , as a minor product, was detected for the composites with BiOI contents of 5.2, 7.4, and 10.1 wt.The generation of the products may be explained by the formation of heterojunctions between g-C 3 N 4 and BiOI in the composites.With the increase of the BiOI contents, the heterojunctions increase, resulting in the improvement of the yield rates of CO, CH 4 , and O 2 .When the BiOI contents get too high, the BiOI morphology is varied from lamella to the hierarchical microsphere and the specific surface area of the composites decrease (Figure S6 andS7).The efficient heterojunction interface did not increase distinctly whereas the excessive BiOI with narrow band gap would act as the recombination center of photogenerated electrons and holes. 36hus, the drop of the productivity should be ascribed to the decreasing the separation efficiency of electron-hole pairs. Figure 6 shows the photocatalytic CO 2 activities for the optimal 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 sample.As can be seen, the total yields of CH 4 , CO, H 2 , and O 2 are enhanced with the extension of the irradiation time.However, the maximal yield rates of CO, CH 4 and O 2 are found at 3 h irradiation, which attained 4.86, 0.18, and 2.78 molg cat -1 h -1 , respectively (Figure S8).The reduction of the photocatalytic activity may be ascribed to the negative effect of the produced hydrogen peroxide, as shown below. The effect of light intensity and light wavelength on the photoreduction CO 2 activity for 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 catalyst were also investigated and the results are summarized in Table 1.The product yields of CO 2 reduction increase not too much as the wavelength of irradiation light extending from 400-800 to 320-800 nm, probably due to its VLD property of the synthesized composite.Nevertheless, the yields of products, including CH 4 , H 2 , O 2 , and CO, increase with the intensity of illuminating light.As a result, the molar ratio of CH 4 /CO grows from 0 to 7.92 when the light intensity increases from 65 to 260 mWcm -2 .This can be explained in terms of the requisite electron number of generating different products.Consequently, the generation of the CO 2 reduction products is mainly dependent on the intensity of the illumination light. To confirm the role of the heterojunctions, the photocatalytic activity of CO 2 reduction of the mechanical mixtures as contrasts were measured and the results are summarized in Table S2.The yields of CO, CH 4 , and O 2 for the mechanically mixed samples decrease greatly in comparison to their counterparts, indicating that the loosely contacted interfaces are insufficient for photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .Thus, it may be reasonably deduced that the formation of heterojunctions between the interfacial phases are responsible for the enhanced photocatalytic activity of the synthesized composites.To further verify the effect of the heterojunctions, we used g-C 3 N 4 , 2.5-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 , and 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 as catalysts to contrast their photocatalytic activity under different atmosphere (Table 2).Under N 2 /H 2 O atmosphere, the products for all the samples are H 2 and O 2 , and the yields of which decrease with increasing the BiOI contents.When N 2 is replaced by CO 2 , the yields of CO or CH 4 increase with BiOI content, accompanying with the yields of H 2 deceased regularly.The results show that the reaction of CO 2 reduction is competitive to that of H 2 generation and the formation of the heterojunctions is more favorable for CO 2 reduction. On the other hand, we notice that the yield of O 2 for all the composites is lower than that expected whether in N 2 /H 2 O or in CO 2 /H 2 O atmosphere.The discrepancy between the practical yields and the calculated values may be attributed to the kinetically competitive reactions of two-electron water oxidation to hydrogen peroxide. 62To check the existence of the intermediate Reproducibility and durability are critical issues for the longterm use of a catalyst in practical application.In the durability tests, the photoreduction CO 2 of the typical 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 catalyst was repeated for five times, as shown in Figure 7.The results show that the yields of CO, CH 4 , H 2 and O 2 decreased slightly after five cycles.To illustrate the stability of the catalyst, XPS spectra measurements were applied for detecting the change of the chemical composition.It can be seen that the high resolution XPS spectra of C 1s, N 1s, and Bi 4f for 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 after five cycles maintain their peak positions as before reaction, while a small amount of I 3 -ions at 619.1 eV, 63 probably deriving from the oxidation of I -ions, could be identified (Figure S10).To further confirm the existence of I 3 ions, Raman spectra were measured.An obvious peak at 108 cm -1 in Raman spectra becomes stronger gradually, indicating the accumulation of I 3 -ions with recycling (Figure S11). 63Therefore, we assume that it is the accumulation of the -ions that results in the reduction of the recycling performance of the materials.Except for the negative effect, we assume that the detected I 3 -ions play a crucial role on the transfer of the photogenerated electrons across the heterojunctions, as shown below. 3.5.Determination of the Charge Transfer Mode.The band edge positions of the composites are known to influence directly on the reduction and oxidation reactions occurring at the catalyst surface.The band energy alignment of the typical 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composite is determined by combining UPS with XPS and DRS. Figure 8 shows the UPS spectra of g-C 3 N 4 , BiOI, and 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 measured at sample biases (-8.0 V).The valence band position (VB) of pure g-C 3 N 4 was first estimated to be situated at -6.61 eV (vs vacuum), according to the linear intersection method. 64The work function of g-C 3 N 4 was calculated to be 4.18 eV (vs vacuum) and the corresponding Fermi level (E F ) to be -4.18eV (vs vacuum).Considering that the band gap (E g ) of pure g-C 3 N 4 is 2.69 eV, the conduction band position (CB) is located at ca. -3.92 eV (vs.vacuum).Correspondingly, the potentials of E VB and E CB are positioned at 2.17 and -0.52 eV (vs NHE), respectively, based on the relationship between the vacuum energy (E abs ) and the normal electrode potential (E ), E abs -E -4.44. 64imilarly, the values of E VB , E CB , and E F of BiOI are determined to be 2.42, 0.67, and 2.01 eV (vs.NHE) (Table S3). With the formation of the BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 heterostructures, alignment of the Fermi levels is assumed at the interfacial phases of two components. 36The value of apparent E F of the composite can be estimated to be 0.30 eV (vs.NHE) by linear intersection method in the UPS spectrum.Accompanying with the movement of Fermi levels, the CB and VB edge positions for both BiOI and g-C 3 N 4 are shifted upward or downward.In this case, the band offsets of 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunctions can be calculated using XPS core-level (CL) alignment method. 65The XPS core-level and valence band spectra of the pure materials and the 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 heterostructure are shown in Figures 2 andS12, respectively.According to the conventional method, 66 the E VB and E CB for 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composite are calculated to be about 2.17 0.23 and 1.23 0.15 eV (Table S3).Supposing that the possible band bending is neglected 53 and given that the difference values (Dvalue) between CB and E F of g-C 3 N 4 as well as D-values between VB and E F of BiOI remain unchanged for pre-and after-contacting, the VB potential of g-C 3 N 4 in the composite is 2.65 eV and the CB potential of BiOI in the composite is -1.04 eV.The corresponding band structure diagram can thus be schemed and a staggered band alignment heterostructure is constructed, as shown in Figure 9. The direction of the photogenerated charge across the heterojunctions for the synthesized materials can be inferred by coupling the experimental results with the established band alignment (Figure 10).In the present study, the p-type BiOI was deposited on the n-type g-C 3 N 4 surface and the p-n junctions were formed at the interfacial phases, resulting in inner electrical fields established in the direction from the ntype g-C 3 N 4 to p-type BiOI.When exposing to the simulated light, the VB electrons of both g-C 3 N 4 and BiOI could be excited up.The charge transfer at the interfacial phases may follow the double-transfer mechanism 353637 or Z-scheme transfer mode. 3If the double-transfer mechanism is adopted, the reduction reaction would proceed on the CB of g-C 3 N 4 , as well as the oxidation reaction on the VB of BiOI (Figure 10a).According to above results, CO has been produced over 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 under 400-800 nm irradiation with 65 mWcm -2 (Table 2).The contract experiment was carried out under the similar conditions, except the light source using 485-515 nm.Since the specific light excites BiOI solely, the photogenerated electrons would transfer from the CB of BiOI to that of g-C 3 N 4 for CO 2 reduction.No products were detected and hence, the hypothesis of the double-transfer mechanism is invalid.From the enhanced photocatalytic activity, we assume that the charge transfer of the synthesized BiOI/g-C3N4 catalysts takes Zscheme mode under our experimental conditions. To give powerful supports to Z-scheme mode, a series of comparative experiments were conducted using EDTA as scavenging agent to eliminate the photogenerated holes in the process of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.Figure 11 shows the yields of CO, CH 4 , H 2 , and O 2 for the mixtures of the typical 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 catalyst with EDTA after running different times.In comparison with normal catalysts (Figure 7), the H 2 yield has no visible change but the yields of CO and CH 4 have a distinct increase.More obviously, the generation of O 2 is suppressed completely.All these results can be ascribed to the effect of adding EDTA.With the addition of EDTA, the photogenerated holes are scavenged, resulting in more efficient separation of the photogenerated electrons and holes.Ultimately, the generation of O 2 is hindered while the yields of CO and CH 4 are enhanced. On the other hand, the Z-scheme charge transfer would be broken with the addition of the scavenger.In consideration of the extremely reversibility of the I 3 -/I -pair, as demonstrated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests (Figure S13), we suppose that the I 3 -ions act as the electron carriers in the process of the photogenerated electron transfer across the p-n junctions.In this case, the generation of intermediate I 3 -ions was blocked as the scavenger is mixed.The corresponding contrast tests show that the peak at 108 cm -1 in the Raman spectra after different cycles disappeared (Figure S14), implying that the photogenerated electrons across the heterojunction are indeed through the transmitting role of the intermediate I 3 -ions.Under light irradiation, the I -ions near the p-n junctions are oxidized to I 3 -ions by the photogenerated holes of BiOI and simultaneously, the I 3 -ions could be reduced by the photogenerated electrons from g-C 3 N 4 , resulting in the efficient separation of the photogenerated holes and electrons on the side of g-C 3 N 4 and BiOI, respectively.When the holes were scavenged, there will be no I 3 -ions detectable.In order to further confirm the role of the intermediate I 3 ions, we construct Bi 5 O 7 I/g-C 3 N 4 and Bi 2 O 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composites to investigate the effect of the content of I element on the CO 2 reduction.The results show that the reduction of I content in the composite is unfavorable for the reduction of CO 2 (Table S4), implying that the I 3 -intermediate plays an important role in the charge transfer process. Consequently, we conclude that it is the very reversibility of the I 3 -/I -pairs that accelerates the photoinduced electrons and holes quenching consecutively at the interfacial phase and finally, achieves Z-scheme transfer. To provide convincing evidence for the efficient separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, we recorded transient photocurrent responses of pure materials and 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composites over 15 on-off irradiation cycles.Figure 12 shows a comparison of I-t curves for BiOI, g-C 3 N 4 , and 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composite.The photocurrent response of the composite material can reproducibly increase under each irradiation and quickly recover in the dark.Moreover, the photocurrent responses of the composite increase significantly in comparison with those of pure materials, indicating the higher separation efficiency of electron-hole pairs under simulated solar-light irradiation.Besides, the PL spectra of the BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composite photocatalysts at an excitation wavelength of 365 nm were measured and presented in Figure S15.The results show that that the emission intensity of the composites distinctly decreased weakest intensity at x 7.4, indicating that the efficient separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. 67n the basis of the above XPS and Raman results as well as the powerful evidence from transient photocurrent and photoluminescence spectra, we conclude that the charge transfer mode for the synthesized photocatalysts is in accordance well with the process shown in Figure 10b and the x-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composites are a new type of indirect solidstate Z-scheme photocatalyst, which conducts the photogenerated electrons across the interfacial phase through the intermediate I 3 -/I -pairs.3.6.Possible Photocatalytic Mechanism.According to the confirmed charge transfer mode and the detected intermediates, the mechanism of CO 2 reduction is proposed as follows: (2) (3) (5) Since the CB potential of the composites is more negative than that of CO 2 /CO (-0.53 V), H 2 O/H 2 (-0.41 V), and CO 2 /CH 4 (-0.24V) pairs, CO 2 can be reduced to yield CO, H 2 , and CH 4 thermodynamically. 2 However, the generation of CH 4 is more difficult than that of CO because the formation of CO requires 2H /2e -, while the formation of CH 4 needs 8H / 8e -.Therefore, the photoreduction of CO 2 to CO is dynamically favored processes in reality.Under stronger illuminating light intensity, more photogenerated electrons are excited and bigger electron density is obtained on the CB of BiOI side in the composite through the intermediate I 3 -/I - pairs.As a result, not only are CO yields increased but also CH 4 release is added (Table 1). Besides the photogenerated electrons, the role of the concomitantly photogenerated holes cannot be ignored.The holes may react with the adsorbed water molecules to generate oxygen, hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) or hydroxide radicals ( OH) 5 The detection of the intermediate product H 2 O 2 as well as the O 2 yield lower than theoretical value has confirmed experimentally the correctness of the above mechanism.Considering that the VB of the prepared composite catalysts (E VB 2.17 0.23 V) is located below the oxidation potential of water (E (H 2 O/ OH) 2.32 V), the formation of hydroxyl radicals is a thermodynamically favored process.To verify the existence of hydroxyl radicals, PL method was applied by the using TA as a probe molecule. 49Figure S16 presents the PL spectral change of the photocatalysts in the solution of TAOH after different time of illumination.An obvious increase of PL intensity at 425 nm is observed with the extension of the irradiation time.The results show that the hydroxyl radicals are actually generated in the catalytic process and participate in the photocatalytic reactions. The detection of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) and hydroxide radicals has confirmed experimentally the correctness of the above mechanism of CO 2 reduction."}, {"llm generation": "320-800 nm (UV-Vis)", "source": "The product yields of CO 2 reduction increase not too much as the wavelength of irradiation light extending from 400-800 to 320-800 nm, probably due to its VLD property of the synthesized composite.", "context": "3.1.Structure and Morphology.The XRD patterns of pure g-C 3 N 4 , pure BiOI and x-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composites are displayed in Figure 1.Two characteristic peaks of pure g-C 3 N 4 are observed at 27.5and 13.1, which can be indexed to (002) and (100) diffraction planes, respectively.The strong XRD peak at 27.5is indicative of the interplanar stacking of aromatic systems with a distance of 0.326 nm, while the latter with a much weaker intensity at 13.1is attributed to in-plane repeating units with a period of 0.675 nm. 50The two diffraction peaks are in good agreement with those of other reported g-C 3 N 4 . 47Pure BiOI is in its tetragonal phase (PDF No. 00-010-0445) and exhibits several strong peaks at 29.6, 31.6,45.4, and 55.2.For the x-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composites, all the XRD patterns could be well indexed to g-C 3 N 4 and tetragonal phase of BiOI.In addition, the intensities of diffraction peaks of g-C 3 N 4 become weaker, while those of BiOI become stronger with the increase of the contents of BiOI.When the amount of BiOI is lower than 5.2 wt, the characteristic peaks of BiOI is not found, which may be attributed to lower detectable limit of instrument or to BiOI highly dispersed on the surface of g-C 3 N 4 .However, the existence of BiOI can be detected and estimated by analyses TG, as shown in Figure S1.

The O 1s peak (Figure S3) was deconvoluted into three components, centered at 529.2, 531.9, and 533.4 eV, respectively.Two peaks at around 531.9 and 533.4 eV are related to absorbed H 2 O molecule and hydroxyl group on the surface. 55,56The lowest binding energy of O 1s at 529.2 eV is regarded as the Bi-O bond in Bi 2 O 2 slabs of BiOI, 57 which has about 0.4 shifts to low binding energies compared with that of pure BiOI.All the shifts for binding energy in the XPS spectra can be attributed to the intense interaction between closely contacted phases of BiOI and g-C 3 N 4 , implying that the hetero junctions have been formed in the as-synthesized composite. 58EM was used to investigate the morphology and microstructure of the synthesized catalysts.Figure 3 shows the TEM images of g-C 3 N 4 and the typical 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composite.It can be seen that the morphology of pure g-C 3 N 4 (Figure 3a) shows a characteristic crumpled layered structure.For the composite, it is observed that BiOI particles are uniformly deposited on the surface of g-C 3 N 4 (Figure 3b).To observe more clearly the microstructure of the composite, the highresolution TEM image of area e in Figure 3b is shown in Figure 3c.A lattice spacing of 0.301 nm is determined, which is attributed to the (102) facet of BiOI.The lattice fringes of g-C 3 N 4 , however, are not observed clearly due to its weak crystallization.Nevertheless, the EDX pattern of area k contains C, N, O, and Cu elements, while that of area m includes not only C, N, O, and Cu elements but also Bi and I (Figure 3d and3e).The results show that the area m is composed of g-C 3 N 4 and BiOI, implying that BiOI is closely deposited on the surface of g-C 3 N 4 layer in this region.To further explore the detailed elemental distributions, energy mappings of N, Bi, and I over the 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 were constructed (in Figure S4).All elements were uniformly distributed on composite, as confirmed by area elemental detection.From the element mapping analysis, it is observed that BiOI could be uniformly deposited on the entire surface of the g-C 3 N 4 . 3.2.UV-Vis DRS Spectra. Figure 4 shows the UV-Vis adsorption spectra of pure BiOI, g-C 3 N 4 and x-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composites.It is obvious that the absorption wavelengths of pure BiOI, g-C 3 N 4 and all the composites display distinct absorption in the visible-light region.Additionally, the absorption edge of the composites shifts regularly to long wavelength with increasing of BiOI content.The band gaps (E g ) of pure materials were estimated by the plot of (h) 1/2 versus photo energy (h) (Figure S5), considering that both BiOI 59 and g-C 3 N 4 10 are indirect band gap semiconductors.The calculated band gaps of BiOI and g-C 3 N 4 are 1.75 and 2.69 eV, respectively, which agrees well with that of the reported BiOI 60 and g-C 3 N 4 . 61.4.Photocatalytic Performance.The photoreduction CO 2 activities of the prepared photocatalysts were evaluated in the presence of water vapor under visible light irradiation.Figure 5 shows the CO 2 photoreduction yields for the assynthesized composites after 5 h irradiation.The photocatalytic products for pure g-C 3 N 4 include CO, H 2 , and O 2 , while there are no products detectable for pure BiOI.With the increase of the BiOI content in the composites, the yields of H 2 decrease monotonously while those of CO and O 2 increase and reach the maximal yields of 17.9 and 9.8 molg cat -1 , respectively, at 7.4 wt.No other products such as HCOOH, HCHO, or CH 3 OH were detected by either GC or GC-MS analyses.Besides, CH 4 , as a minor product, was detected for the composites with BiOI contents of 5.2, 7.4, and 10.1 wt.The generation of the products may be explained by the formation of heterojunctions between g-C 3 N 4 and BiOI in the composites.With the increase of the BiOI contents, the heterojunctions increase, resulting in the improvement of the yield rates of CO, CH 4 , and O 2 .When the BiOI contents get too high, the BiOI morphology is varied from lamella to the hierarchical microsphere and the specific surface area of the composites decrease (Figure S6 andS7).The efficient heterojunction interface did not increase distinctly whereas the excessive BiOI with narrow band gap would act as the recombination center of photogenerated electrons and holes. 36hus, the drop of the productivity should be ascribed to the decreasing the separation efficiency of electron-hole pairs. Figure 6 shows the photocatalytic CO 2 activities for the optimal 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 sample.As can be seen, the total yields of CH 4 , CO, H 2 , and O 2 are enhanced with the extension of the irradiation time.However, the maximal yield rates of CO, CH 4 and O 2 are found at 3 h irradiation, which attained 4.86, 0.18, and 2.78 molg cat -1 h -1 , respectively (Figure S8).The reduction of the photocatalytic activity may be ascribed to the negative effect of the produced hydrogen peroxide, as shown below. The effect of light intensity and light wavelength on the photoreduction CO 2 activity for 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 catalyst were also investigated and the results are summarized in Table 1.The product yields of CO 2 reduction increase not too much as the wavelength of irradiation light extending from 400-800 to 320-800 nm, probably due to its VLD property of the synthesized composite.Nevertheless, the yields of products, including CH 4 , H 2 , O 2 , and CO, increase with the intensity of illuminating light.As a result, the molar ratio of CH 4 /CO grows from 0 to 7.92 when the light intensity increases from 65 to 260 mWcm -2 .This can be explained in terms of the requisite electron number of generating different products.Consequently, the generation of the CO 2 reduction products is mainly dependent on the intensity of the illumination light. To confirm the role of the heterojunctions, the photocatalytic activity of CO 2 reduction of the mechanical mixtures as contrasts were measured and the results are summarized in Table S2.The yields of CO, CH 4 , and O 2 for the mechanically mixed samples decrease greatly in comparison to their counterparts, indicating that the loosely contacted interfaces are insufficient for photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .Thus, it may be reasonably deduced that the formation of heterojunctions between the interfacial phases are responsible for the enhanced photocatalytic activity of the synthesized composites.To further verify the effect of the heterojunctions, we used g-C 3 N 4 , 2.5-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 , and 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 as catalysts to contrast their photocatalytic activity under different atmosphere (Table 2).Under N 2 /H 2 O atmosphere, the products for all the samples are H 2 and O 2 , and the yields of which decrease with increasing the BiOI contents.When N 2 is replaced by CO 2 , the yields of CO or CH 4 increase with BiOI content, accompanying with the yields of H 2 deceased regularly.The results show that the reaction of CO 2 reduction is competitive to that of H 2 generation and the formation of the heterojunctions is more favorable for CO 2 reduction. On the other hand, we notice that the yield of O 2 for all the composites is lower than that expected whether in N 2 /H 2 O or in CO 2 /H 2 O atmosphere.The discrepancy between the practical yields and the calculated values may be attributed to the kinetically competitive reactions of two-electron water oxidation to hydrogen peroxide. 62To check the existence of the intermediate Reproducibility and durability are critical issues for the longterm use of a catalyst in practical application.In the durability tests, the photoreduction CO 2 of the typical 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 catalyst was repeated for five times, as shown in Figure 7.The results show that the yields of CO, CH 4 , H 2 and O 2 decreased slightly after five cycles.To illustrate the stability of the catalyst, XPS spectra measurements were applied for detecting the change of the chemical composition.It can be seen that the high resolution XPS spectra of C 1s, N 1s, and Bi 4f for 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 after five cycles maintain their peak positions as before reaction, while a small amount of I 3 -ions at 619.1 eV, 63 probably deriving from the oxidation of I -ions, could be identified (Figure S10).To further confirm the existence of I 3 ions, Raman spectra were measured.An obvious peak at 108 cm -1 in Raman spectra becomes stronger gradually, indicating the accumulation of I 3 -ions with recycling (Figure S11). 63Therefore, we assume that it is the accumulation of the -ions that results in the reduction of the recycling performance of the materials.Except for the negative effect, we assume that the detected I 3 -ions play a crucial role on the transfer of the photogenerated electrons across the heterojunctions, as shown below. 3.5.Determination of the Charge Transfer Mode.The band edge positions of the composites are known to influence directly on the reduction and oxidation reactions occurring at the catalyst surface.The band energy alignment of the typical 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composite is determined by combining UPS with XPS and DRS. Figure 8 shows the UPS spectra of g-C 3 N 4 , BiOI, and 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 measured at sample biases (-8.0 V).The valence band position (VB) of pure g-C 3 N 4 was first estimated to be situated at -6.61 eV (vs vacuum), according to the linear intersection method. 64The work function of g-C 3 N 4 was calculated to be 4.18 eV (vs vacuum) and the corresponding Fermi level (E F ) to be -4.18eV (vs vacuum).Considering that the band gap (E g ) of pure g-C 3 N 4 is 2.69 eV, the conduction band position (CB) is located at ca. -3.92 eV (vs.vacuum).Correspondingly, the potentials of E VB and E CB are positioned at 2.17 and -0.52 eV (vs NHE), respectively, based on the relationship between the vacuum energy (E abs ) and the normal electrode potential (E ), E abs -E -4.44. 64imilarly, the values of E VB , E CB , and E F of BiOI are determined to be 2.42, 0.67, and 2.01 eV (vs.NHE) (Table S3). With the formation of the BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 heterostructures, alignment of the Fermi levels is assumed at the interfacial phases of two components. 36The value of apparent E F of the composite can be estimated to be 0.30 eV (vs.NHE) by linear intersection method in the UPS spectrum.Accompanying with the movement of Fermi levels, the CB and VB edge positions for both BiOI and g-C 3 N 4 are shifted upward or downward.In this case, the band offsets of 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunctions can be calculated using XPS core-level (CL) alignment method. 65The XPS core-level and valence band spectra of the pure materials and the 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 heterostructure are shown in Figures 2 andS12, respectively.According to the conventional method, 66 the E VB and E CB for 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composite are calculated to be about 2.17 0.23 and 1.23 0.15 eV (Table S3).Supposing that the possible band bending is neglected 53 and given that the difference values (Dvalue) between CB and E F of g-C 3 N 4 as well as D-values between VB and E F of BiOI remain unchanged for pre-and after-contacting, the VB potential of g-C 3 N 4 in the composite is 2.65 eV and the CB potential of BiOI in the composite is -1.04 eV.The corresponding band structure diagram can thus be schemed and a staggered band alignment heterostructure is constructed, as shown in Figure 9. The direction of the photogenerated charge across the heterojunctions for the synthesized materials can be inferred by coupling the experimental results with the established band alignment (Figure 10).In the present study, the p-type BiOI was deposited on the n-type g-C 3 N 4 surface and the p-n junctions were formed at the interfacial phases, resulting in inner electrical fields established in the direction from the ntype g-C 3 N 4 to p-type BiOI.When exposing to the simulated light, the VB electrons of both g-C 3 N 4 and BiOI could be excited up.The charge transfer at the interfacial phases may follow the double-transfer mechanism 353637 or Z-scheme transfer mode. 3If the double-transfer mechanism is adopted, the reduction reaction would proceed on the CB of g-C 3 N 4 , as well as the oxidation reaction on the VB of BiOI (Figure 10a).According to above results, CO has been produced over 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 under 400-800 nm irradiation with 65 mWcm -2 (Table 2).The contract experiment was carried out under the similar conditions, except the light source using 485-515 nm.Since the specific light excites BiOI solely, the photogenerated electrons would transfer from the CB of BiOI to that of g-C 3 N 4 for CO 2 reduction.No products were detected and hence, the hypothesis of the double-transfer mechanism is invalid.From the enhanced photocatalytic activity, we assume that the charge transfer of the synthesized BiOI/g-C3N4 catalysts takes Zscheme mode under our experimental conditions. To give powerful supports to Z-scheme mode, a series of comparative experiments were conducted using EDTA as scavenging agent to eliminate the photogenerated holes in the process of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.Figure 11 shows the yields of CO, CH 4 , H 2 , and O 2 for the mixtures of the typical 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 catalyst with EDTA after running different times.In comparison with normal catalysts (Figure 7), the H 2 yield has no visible change but the yields of CO and CH 4 have a distinct increase.More obviously, the generation of O 2 is suppressed completely.All these results can be ascribed to the effect of adding EDTA.With the addition of EDTA, the photogenerated holes are scavenged, resulting in more efficient separation of the photogenerated electrons and holes.Ultimately, the generation of O 2 is hindered while the yields of CO and CH 4 are enhanced. On the other hand, the Z-scheme charge transfer would be broken with the addition of the scavenger.In consideration of the extremely reversibility of the I 3 -/I -pair, as demonstrated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests (Figure S13), we suppose that the I 3 -ions act as the electron carriers in the process of the photogenerated electron transfer across the p-n junctions.In this case, the generation of intermediate I 3 -ions was blocked as the scavenger is mixed.The corresponding contrast tests show that the peak at 108 cm -1 in the Raman spectra after different cycles disappeared (Figure S14), implying that the photogenerated electrons across the heterojunction are indeed through the transmitting role of the intermediate I 3 -ions.Under light irradiation, the I -ions near the p-n junctions are oxidized to I 3 -ions by the photogenerated holes of BiOI and simultaneously, the I 3 -ions could be reduced by the photogenerated electrons from g-C 3 N 4 , resulting in the efficient separation of the photogenerated holes and electrons on the side of g-C 3 N 4 and BiOI, respectively.When the holes were scavenged, there will be no I 3 -ions detectable.In order to further confirm the role of the intermediate I 3 ions, we construct Bi 5 O 7 I/g-C 3 N 4 and Bi 2 O 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composites to investigate the effect of the content of I element on the CO 2 reduction.The results show that the reduction of I content in the composite is unfavorable for the reduction of CO 2 (Table S4), implying that the I 3 -intermediate plays an important role in the charge transfer process. Consequently, we conclude that it is the very reversibility of the I 3 -/I -pairs that accelerates the photoinduced electrons and holes quenching consecutively at the interfacial phase and finally, achieves Z-scheme transfer. To provide convincing evidence for the efficient separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, we recorded transient photocurrent responses of pure materials and 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composites over 15 on-off irradiation cycles.Figure 12 shows a comparison of I-t curves for BiOI, g-C 3 N 4 , and 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composite.The photocurrent response of the composite material can reproducibly increase under each irradiation and quickly recover in the dark.Moreover, the photocurrent responses of the composite increase significantly in comparison with those of pure materials, indicating the higher separation efficiency of electron-hole pairs under simulated solar-light irradiation.Besides, the PL spectra of the BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composite photocatalysts at an excitation wavelength of 365 nm were measured and presented in Figure S15.The results show that that the emission intensity of the composites distinctly decreased weakest intensity at x 7.4, indicating that the efficient separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. 67n the basis of the above XPS and Raman results as well as the powerful evidence from transient photocurrent and photoluminescence spectra, we conclude that the charge transfer mode for the synthesized photocatalysts is in accordance well with the process shown in Figure 10b and the x-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composites are a new type of indirect solidstate Z-scheme photocatalyst, which conducts the photogenerated electrons across the interfacial phase through the intermediate I 3 -/I -pairs.3.6.Possible Photocatalytic Mechanism.According to the confirmed charge transfer mode and the detected intermediates, the mechanism of CO 2 reduction is proposed as follows: (2) (3) (5) Since the CB potential of the composites is more negative than that of CO 2 /CO (-0.53 V), H 2 O/H 2 (-0.41 V), and CO 2 /CH 4 (-0.24V) pairs, CO 2 can be reduced to yield CO, H 2 , and CH 4 thermodynamically. 2 However, the generation of CH 4 is more difficult than that of CO because the formation of CO requires 2H /2e -, while the formation of CH 4 needs 8H / 8e -.Therefore, the photoreduction of CO 2 to CO is dynamically favored processes in reality.Under stronger illuminating light intensity, more photogenerated electrons are excited and bigger electron density is obtained on the CB of BiOI side in the composite through the intermediate I 3 -/I - pairs.As a result, not only are CO yields increased but also CH 4 release is added (Table 1). Besides the photogenerated electrons, the role of the concomitantly photogenerated holes cannot be ignored.The holes may react with the adsorbed water molecules to generate oxygen, hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) or hydroxide radicals ( OH) 5 The detection of the intermediate product H 2 O 2 as well as the O 2 yield lower than theoretical value has confirmed experimentally the correctness of the above mechanism.Considering that the VB of the prepared composite catalysts (E VB 2.17 0.23 V) is located below the oxidation potential of water (E (H 2 O/ OH) 2.32 V), the formation of hydroxyl radicals is a thermodynamically favored process.To verify the existence of hydroxyl radicals, PL method was applied by the using TA as a probe molecule. 49Figure S16 presents the PL spectral change of the photocatalysts in the solution of TAOH after different time of illumination.An obvious increase of PL intensity at 425 nm is observed with the extension of the irradiation time.The results show that the hydroxyl radicals are actually generated in the catalytic process and participate in the photocatalytic reactions. The detection of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) and hydroxide radicals has confirmed experimentally the correctness of the above mechanism of CO 2 reduction."}, {"llm generation": "Visible light", "source": "The optimal 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composite is proven to be good photocatalyst for CO 2 reduction and exhibits more efficient photocatalytic performance than pure BiOI and g-C 3 N 4 under visible light ( 400 nm).", "context": "A series of x-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalysts were synthesized by a simple deposition method.The optimal 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composite is proven to be good photocatalyst for CO 2 reduction and exhibits more efficient photocatalytic performance than pure BiOI and g-C 3 N 4 under visible light ( 400 nm).The enhanced photoactivity is attributed to the efficient separation of the photogenerated charge carriers.An indirect Z-scheme charge transfer mode is demonstrated by checking the redox I 3 -/I -pair.On the basis of the final products and the intermediate OH and H 2 O 2 , a potential mechanism is further proposed.In summary, the present research is expected to be useful in developing Z-scheme photocatalysts and provide some meaningful information for deep understanding how the photogenerated electrons transfer across the solid-solid contact interface.

terephthalic acid (TA) as a probe molecule.It has been proven that TA reacts readily with OH to produce 2-hydroxyterephthalic acid (TAOH) with a typical fluorescent signal at 425 nm, and the intensity of the TAOH peak is proportional to the amount of hydroxyl radicals formed. 49The detection procedures were similar to the photocatalytic experiments, except that the catalysts were replaced by the

It is worth noting that an extra peak at 12.2is observed for 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 .The peak can be ascribed to (0 0 1) plane of BiOI phase (PDF No: 01-085-0863).This phase of BiOI, similar to the former phase, has a 2D structure along c axial, and crystallizes in the Tetragonal space group P4/nmm.The difference between the two phase is the length of c axis, which deceases from 9.14 A for the former to 7.21 A for the later.The appearance of the later may be attributed to the (001) plane of BiOI coupling with g-C 3 N 4 , leading to the interaction force between BiOI and g-C 3 N 4 strengthening and as a result, the ratio of the later phase increases.The subsequent weakening of the peak may be due to the agglomerate of BiOI (Figure S6). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out to elucidate the surface composition and the chemical states of the elements.The survey XPS spectrum for 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 indicates that the composite mainly consists of C, N, Bi, I, and O atoms, which are well consistent with the chemical compositions (Figure S2).To gain more insight into the chemical bonding between the carbon and nitrogen atoms in the composite, the high resolution XPS spectra of C 1s and N 1s were deconvoluted by Gaussian-Lorenzian analysis method.For C 1s spectra (Figure 2a), two distinct peaks at 284.8 and 288.0 eV and a low intensity peak at 286.0 eV are observed.The first peak is attributed to sp 2 C-C bonds, and the second one is sp 2 hybridized carbon in N-containing aromatic ring (N-CN), 51,52 while the last peak with low intensity at around 286.0 eV may be ascribed to the C-NH 2 species on the g-C 3 N 4 . 52For N 1s spectra (Figure 2b), four fitted peaks are observed to locate at around 398.3, 399.4,400.7, and 403.9 eV, respectively.These peaks can be regarded as the sp 2 hybridized nitrogen involved in triazine rings (C-NC), the tertiary nitrogen N-(C) 3 groups, the free amino groups (C-N-H), and -excitations, respectively. 24Compared with pure g-C 3 N 4 , N 1s peaks except the -excitation one have about 0.4 shifts to higher binding energies.By contrast, the deconvoluted C 1s peaks have only a slight shift. To further probe the chemical states of Bi and I elements, the high resolution Bi 4f and I 3d XPS spectra for pure BiOI and 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 material were also deconvoluted by curve fitting method.Two strong peaks at 164.3 and 159.0 eV as well as two satellite peaks at 165.4 and 160.0 eV were detected in the composite, as shown in Figure 2c.The strong peaks, lower than those of pure BiOI, are attributed to the characteristic of Bi 4f 5/2 and Bi 4f 7/2 of Bi(III), as reported in other BiOI-based system. 53Similar shifts are also observed in the high-resolution I 3d spectra (Figure 2d).Two conspicuous peaks are available at binding energies of 618.3 eV for I 3d 5/2 and 629.8 eV for I 3d 3/2 , 54 both of which have a shift of 0.5-0.6 eV to low energy region compared with those of pure BiOI. The O 1s peak (Figure S3) was deconvoluted into three components, centered at 529.2, 531.9, and 533.4 eV, respectively.Two peaks at around 531.9 and 533.4 eV are related to absorbed H 2 O molecule and hydroxyl group on the surface. 55,56The lowest binding energy of O 1s at 529.2 eV is regarded as the Bi-O bond in Bi 2 O 2 slabs of BiOI, 57 which has about 0.4 shifts to low binding energies compared with that of pure BiOI.All the shifts for binding energy in the XPS spectra can be attributed to the intense interaction between closely contacted phases of BiOI and g-C 3 N 4 , implying that the hetero junctions have been formed in the as-synthesized composite. 58EM was used to investigate the morphology and microstructure of the synthesized catalysts.Figure 3 shows the TEM images of g-C 3 N 4 and the typical 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composite.It can be seen that the morphology of pure g-C 3 N 4 (Figure 3a) shows a characteristic crumpled layered structure.For the composite, it is observed that BiOI particles are uniformly deposited on the surface of g-C 3 N 4 (Figure 3b).To observe more clearly the microstructure of the composite, the highresolution TEM image of area e in Figure 3b is shown in Figure 3c.A lattice spacing of 0.301 nm is determined, which is attributed to the (102) facet of BiOI.The lattice fringes of g-C 3 N 4 , however, are not observed clearly due to its weak crystallization.Nevertheless, the EDX pattern of area k contains C, N, O, and Cu elements, while that of area m includes not only C, N, O, and Cu elements but also Bi and I (Figure 3d and3e).The results show that the area m is composed of g-C 3 N 4 and BiOI, implying that BiOI is closely deposited on the surface of g-C 3 N 4 layer in this region.To further explore the detailed elemental distributions, energy mappings of N, Bi, and I over the 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 were constructed (in Figure S4).All elements were uniformly distributed on composite, as confirmed by area elemental detection.From the element mapping analysis, it is observed that BiOI could be uniformly deposited on the entire surface of the g-C 3 N 4 . 3.2.UV-Vis DRS Spectra. Figure 4 shows the UV-Vis adsorption spectra of pure BiOI, g-C 3 N 4 and x-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composites.It is obvious that the absorption wavelengths of pure BiOI, g-C 3 N 4 and all the composites display distinct absorption in the visible-light region.Additionally, the absorption edge of the composites shifts regularly to long wavelength with increasing of BiOI content.The band gaps (E g ) of pure materials were estimated by the plot of (h) 1/2 versus photo energy (h) (Figure S5), considering that both BiOI 59 and g-C 3 N 4 10 are indirect band gap semiconductors.The calculated band gaps of BiOI and g-C 3 N 4 are 1.75 and 2.69 eV, respectively, which agrees well with that of the reported BiOI 60 and g-C 3 N 4 . 61.4.Photocatalytic Performance.The photoreduction CO 2 activities of the prepared photocatalysts were evaluated in the presence of water vapor under visible light irradiation.Figure 5 shows the CO 2 photoreduction yields for the assynthesized composites after 5 h irradiation.The photocatalytic products for pure g-C 3 N 4 include CO, H 2 , and O 2 , while there are no products detectable for pure BiOI.With the increase of the BiOI content in the composites, the yields of H 2 decrease monotonously while those of CO and O 2 increase and reach the maximal yields of 17.9 and 9.8 molg cat -1 , respectively, at 7.4 wt.No other products such as HCOOH, HCHO, or CH 3 OH were detected by either GC or GC-MS analyses.Besides, CH 4 , as a minor product, was detected for the composites with BiOI contents of 5.2, 7.4, and 10.1 wt.The generation of the products may be explained by the formation of heterojunctions between g-C 3 N 4 and BiOI in the composites.With the increase of the BiOI contents, the heterojunctions increase, resulting in the improvement of the yield rates of CO, CH 4 , and O 2 .When the BiOI contents get too high, the BiOI morphology is varied from lamella to the hierarchical microsphere and the specific surface area of the composites decrease (Figure S6 andS7).The efficient heterojunction interface did not increase distinctly whereas the excessive BiOI with narrow band gap would act as the recombination center of photogenerated electrons and holes. 36hus, the drop of the productivity should be ascribed to the decreasing the separation efficiency of electron-hole pairs. Figure 6 shows the photocatalytic CO 2 activities for the optimal 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 sample.As can be seen, the total yields of CH 4 , CO, H 2 , and O 2 are enhanced with the extension of the irradiation time.However, the maximal yield rates of CO, CH 4 and O 2 are found at 3 h irradiation, which attained 4.86, 0.18, and 2.78 molg cat -1 h -1 , respectively (Figure S8).The reduction of the photocatalytic activity may be ascribed to the negative effect of the produced hydrogen peroxide, as shown below. The effect of light intensity and light wavelength on the photoreduction CO 2 activity for 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 catalyst were also investigated and the results are summarized in Table 1.The product yields of CO 2 reduction increase not too much as the wavelength of irradiation light extending from 400-800 to 320-800 nm, probably due to its VLD property of the synthesized composite.Nevertheless, the yields of products, including CH 4 , H 2 , O 2 , and CO, increase with the intensity of illuminating light.As a result, the molar ratio of CH 4 /CO grows from 0 to 7.92 when the light intensity increases from 65 to 260 mWcm -2 .This can be explained in terms of the requisite electron number of generating different products.Consequently, the generation of the CO 2 reduction products is mainly dependent on the intensity of the illumination light. To confirm the role of the heterojunctions, the photocatalytic activity of CO 2 reduction of the mechanical mixtures as contrasts were measured and the results are summarized in Table S2.The yields of CO, CH 4 , and O 2 for the mechanically mixed samples decrease greatly in comparison to their counterparts, indicating that the loosely contacted interfaces are insufficient for photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .Thus, it may be reasonably deduced that the formation of heterojunctions between the interfacial phases are responsible for the enhanced photocatalytic activity of the synthesized composites.To further verify the effect of the heterojunctions, we used g-C 3 N 4 , 2.5-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 , and 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 as catalysts to contrast their photocatalytic activity under different atmosphere (Table 2).Under N 2 /H 2 O atmosphere, the products for all the samples are H 2 and O 2 , and the yields of which decrease with increasing the BiOI contents.When N 2 is replaced by CO 2 , the yields of CO or CH 4 increase with BiOI content, accompanying with the yields of H 2 deceased regularly.The results show that the reaction of CO 2 reduction is competitive to that of H 2 generation and the formation of the heterojunctions is more favorable for CO 2 reduction. On the other hand, we notice that the yield of O 2 for all the composites is lower than that expected whether in N 2 /H 2 O or in CO 2 /H 2 O atmosphere.The discrepancy between the practical yields and the calculated values may be attributed to the kinetically competitive reactions of two-electron water oxidation to hydrogen peroxide. 62To check the existence of the intermediate Reproducibility and durability are critical issues for the longterm use of a catalyst in practical application.In the durability tests, the photoreduction CO 2 of the typical 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 catalyst was repeated for five times, as shown in Figure 7.The results show that the yields of CO, CH 4 , H 2 and O 2 decreased slightly after five cycles.To illustrate the stability of the catalyst, XPS spectra measurements were applied for detecting the change of the chemical composition.It can be seen that the high resolution XPS spectra of C 1s, N 1s, and Bi 4f for 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 after five cycles maintain their peak positions as before reaction, while a small amount of I 3 -ions at 619.1 eV, 63 probably deriving from the oxidation of I -ions, could be identified (Figure S10).To further confirm the existence of I 3 ions, Raman spectra were measured.An obvious peak at 108 cm -1 in Raman spectra becomes stronger gradually, indicating the accumulation of I 3 -ions with recycling (Figure S11). 63Therefore, we assume that it is the accumulation of the -ions that results in the reduction of the recycling performance of the materials.Except for the negative effect, we assume that the detected I 3 -ions play a crucial role on the transfer of the photogenerated electrons across the heterojunctions, as shown below. 3.5.Determination of the Charge Transfer Mode.The band edge positions of the composites are known to influence directly on the reduction and oxidation reactions occurring at the catalyst surface.The band energy alignment of the typical 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composite is determined by combining UPS with XPS and DRS. Figure 8 shows the UPS spectra of g-C 3 N 4 , BiOI, and 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 measured at sample biases (-8.0 V).The valence band position (VB) of pure g-C 3 N 4 was first estimated to be situated at -6.61 eV (vs vacuum), according to the linear intersection method. 64The work function of g-C 3 N 4 was calculated to be 4.18 eV (vs vacuum) and the corresponding Fermi level (E F ) to be -4.18eV (vs vacuum).Considering that the band gap (E g ) of pure g-C 3 N 4 is 2.69 eV, the conduction band position (CB) is located at ca. -3.92 eV (vs.vacuum).Correspondingly, the potentials of E VB and E CB are positioned at 2.17 and -0.52 eV (vs NHE), respectively, based on the relationship between the vacuum energy (E abs ) and the normal electrode potential (E ), E abs -E -4.44. 64imilarly, the values of E VB , E CB , and E F of BiOI are determined to be 2.42, 0.67, and 2.01 eV (vs.NHE) (Table S3). With the formation of the BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 heterostructures, alignment of the Fermi levels is assumed at the interfacial phases of two components. 36The value of apparent E F of the composite can be estimated to be 0.30 eV (vs.NHE) by linear intersection method in the UPS spectrum.Accompanying with the movement of Fermi levels, the CB and VB edge positions for both BiOI and g-C 3 N 4 are shifted upward or downward.In this case, the band offsets of 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunctions can be calculated using XPS core-level (CL) alignment method. 65The XPS core-level and valence band spectra of the pure materials and the 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 heterostructure are shown in Figures 2 andS12, respectively.According to the conventional method, 66 the E VB and E CB for 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composite are calculated to be about 2.17 0.23 and 1.23 0.15 eV (Table S3).Supposing that the possible band bending is neglected 53 and given that the difference values (Dvalue) between CB and E F of g-C 3 N 4 as well as D-values between VB and E F of BiOI remain unchanged for pre-and after-contacting, the VB potential of g-C 3 N 4 in the composite is 2.65 eV and the CB potential of BiOI in the composite is -1.04 eV.The corresponding band structure diagram can thus be schemed and a staggered band alignment heterostructure is constructed, as shown in Figure 9. The direction of the photogenerated charge across the heterojunctions for the synthesized materials can be inferred by coupling the experimental results with the established band alignment (Figure 10).In the present study, the p-type BiOI was deposited on the n-type g-C 3 N 4 surface and the p-n junctions were formed at the interfacial phases, resulting in inner electrical fields established in the direction from the ntype g-C 3 N 4 to p-type BiOI.When exposing to the simulated light, the VB electrons of both g-C 3 N 4 and BiOI could be excited up.The charge transfer at the interfacial phases may follow the double-transfer mechanism 353637 or Z-scheme transfer mode. 3If the double-transfer mechanism is adopted, the reduction reaction would proceed on the CB of g-C 3 N 4 , as well as the oxidation reaction on the VB of BiOI (Figure 10a).According to above results, CO has been produced over 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 under 400-800 nm irradiation with 65 mWcm -2 (Table 2).The contract experiment was carried out under the similar conditions, except the light source using 485-515 nm.Since the specific light excites BiOI solely, the photogenerated electrons would transfer from the CB of BiOI to that of g-C 3 N 4 for CO 2 reduction.No products were detected and hence, the hypothesis of the double-transfer mechanism is invalid.From the enhanced photocatalytic activity, we assume that the charge transfer of the synthesized BiOI/g-C3N4 catalysts takes Zscheme mode under our experimental conditions. To give powerful supports to Z-scheme mode, a series of comparative experiments were conducted using EDTA as scavenging agent to eliminate the photogenerated holes in the process of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.Figure 11 shows the yields of CO, CH 4 , H 2 , and O 2 for the mixtures of the typical 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 catalyst with EDTA after running different times.In comparison with normal catalysts (Figure 7), the H 2 yield has no visible change but the yields of CO and CH 4 have a distinct increase.More obviously, the generation of O 2 is suppressed completely.All these results can be ascribed to the effect of adding EDTA.With the addition of EDTA, the photogenerated holes are scavenged, resulting in more efficient separation of the photogenerated electrons and holes.Ultimately, the generation of O 2 is hindered while the yields of CO and CH 4 are enhanced. On the other hand, the Z-scheme charge transfer would be broken with the addition of the scavenger.In consideration of the extremely reversibility of the I 3 -/I -pair, as demonstrated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests (Figure S13), we suppose that the I 3 -ions act as the electron carriers in the process of the photogenerated electron transfer across the p-n junctions.In this case, the generation of intermediate I 3 -ions was blocked as the scavenger is mixed.The corresponding contrast tests show that the peak at 108 cm -1 in the Raman spectra after different cycles disappeared (Figure S14), implying that the photogenerated electrons across the heterojunction are indeed through the transmitting role of the intermediate I 3 -ions.Under light irradiation, the I -ions near the p-n junctions are oxidized to I 3 -ions by the photogenerated holes of BiOI and simultaneously, the I 3 -ions could be reduced by the photogenerated electrons from g-C 3 N 4 , resulting in the efficient separation of the photogenerated holes and electrons on the side of g-C 3 N 4 and BiOI, respectively.When the holes were scavenged, there will be no I 3 -ions detectable.In order to further confirm the role of the intermediate I 3 ions, we construct Bi 5 O 7 I/g-C 3 N 4 and Bi 2 O 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composites to investigate the effect of the content of I element on the CO 2 reduction.The results show that the reduction of I content in the composite is unfavorable for the reduction of CO 2 (Table S4), implying that the I 3 -intermediate plays an important role in the charge transfer process. Consequently, we conclude that it is the very reversibility of the I 3 -/I -pairs that accelerates the photoinduced electrons and holes quenching consecutively at the interfacial phase and finally, achieves Z-scheme transfer. To provide convincing evidence for the efficient separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, we recorded transient photocurrent responses of pure materials and 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composites over 15 on-off irradiation cycles.Figure 12 shows a comparison of I-t curves for BiOI, g-C 3 N 4 , and 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composite.The photocurrent response of the composite material can reproducibly increase under each irradiation and quickly recover in the dark.Moreover, the photocurrent responses of the composite increase significantly in comparison with those of pure materials, indicating the higher separation efficiency of electron-hole pairs under simulated solar-light irradiation.Besides, the PL spectra of the BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composite photocatalysts at an excitation wavelength of 365 nm were measured and presented in Figure S15.The results show that that the emission intensity of the composites distinctly decreased weakest intensity at x 7.4, indicating that the efficient separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. 67n the basis of the above XPS and Raman results as well as the powerful evidence from transient photocurrent and photoluminescence spectra, we conclude that the charge transfer mode for the synthesized photocatalysts is in accordance well with the process shown in Figure 10b and the x-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composites are a new type of indirect solidstate Z-scheme photocatalyst, which conducts the photogenerated electrons across the interfacial phase through the intermediate I 3 -/I -pairs.3.6.Possible Photocatalytic Mechanism.According to the confirmed charge transfer mode and the detected intermediates, the mechanism of CO 2 reduction is proposed as follows: (2) (3) (5) Since the CB potential of the composites is more negative than that of CO 2 /CO (-0.53 V), H 2 O/H 2 (-0.41 V), and CO 2 /CH 4 (-0.24V) pairs, CO 2 can be reduced to yield CO, H 2 , and CH 4 thermodynamically. 2 However, the generation of CH 4 is more difficult than that of CO because the formation of CO requires 2H /2e -, while the formation of CH 4 needs 8H / 8e -.Therefore, the photoreduction of CO 2 to CO is dynamically favored processes in reality.Under stronger illuminating light intensity, more photogenerated electrons are excited and bigger electron density is obtained on the CB of BiOI side in the composite through the intermediate I 3 -/I - pairs.As a result, not only are CO yields increased but also CH 4 release is added (Table 1). Besides the photogenerated electrons, the role of the concomitantly photogenerated holes cannot be ignored.The holes may react with the adsorbed water molecules to generate oxygen, hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) or hydroxide radicals ( OH) 5 The detection of the intermediate product H 2 O 2 as well as the O 2 yield lower than theoretical value has confirmed experimentally the correctness of the above mechanism.Considering that the VB of the prepared composite catalysts (E VB 2.17 0.23 V) is located below the oxidation potential of water (E (H 2 O/ OH) 2.32 V), the formation of hydroxyl radicals is a thermodynamically favored process.To verify the existence of hydroxyl radicals, PL method was applied by the using TA as a probe molecule. 49Figure S16 presents the PL spectral change of the photocatalysts in the solution of TAOH after different time of illumination.An obvious increase of PL intensity at 425 nm is observed with the extension of the irradiation time.The results show that the hydroxyl radicals are actually generated in the catalytic process and participate in the photocatalytic reactions. The detection of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) and hydroxide radicals has confirmed experimentally the correctness of the above mechanism of CO 2 reduction."}, {"llm generation": "Gas (N 2 /H 2 O atmosphere)", "source": "Under N 2 /H 2 O atmosphere, the products for all the samples are H 2 and O 2 , and the yields of which decrease with increasing the BiOI contents.", "context": "3.1.Structure and Morphology.The XRD patterns of pure g-C 3 N 4 , pure BiOI and x-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composites are displayed in Figure 1.Two characteristic peaks of pure g-C 3 N 4 are observed at 27.5and 13.1, which can be indexed to (002) and (100) diffraction planes, respectively.The strong XRD peak at 27.5is indicative of the interplanar stacking of aromatic systems with a distance of 0.326 nm, while the latter with a much weaker intensity at 13.1is attributed to in-plane repeating units with a period of 0.675 nm. 50The two diffraction peaks are in good agreement with those of other reported g-C 3 N 4 . 47Pure BiOI is in its tetragonal phase (PDF No. 00-010-0445) and exhibits several strong peaks at 29.6, 31.6,45.4, and 55.2.For the x-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composites, all the XRD patterns could be well indexed to g-C 3 N 4 and tetragonal phase of BiOI.In addition, the intensities of diffraction peaks of g-C 3 N 4 become weaker, while those of BiOI become stronger with the increase of the contents of BiOI.When the amount of BiOI is lower than 5.2 wt, the characteristic peaks of BiOI is not found, which may be attributed to lower detectable limit of instrument or to BiOI highly dispersed on the surface of g-C 3 N 4 .However, the existence of BiOI can be detected and estimated by analyses TG, as shown in Figure S1. It is worth noting that an extra peak at 12.2is observed for 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 .The peak can be ascribed to (0 0 1) plane of BiOI phase (PDF No: 01-085-0863).This phase of BiOI, similar to the former phase, has a 2D structure along c axial, and crystallizes in the Tetragonal space group P4/nmm.The difference between the two phase is the length of c axis, which deceases from 9.14 A for the former to 7.21 A for the later.The appearance of the later may be attributed to the (001) plane of BiOI coupling with g-C 3 N 4 , leading to the interaction force between BiOI and g-C 3 N 4 strengthening and as a result, the ratio of the later phase increases.The subsequent weakening of the peak may be due to the agglomerate of BiOI (Figure S6). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out to elucidate the surface composition and the chemical states of the elements.The survey XPS spectrum for 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 indicates that the composite mainly consists of C, N, Bi, I, and O atoms, which are well consistent with the chemical compositions (Figure S2).To gain more insight into the chemical bonding between the carbon and nitrogen atoms in the composite, the high resolution XPS spectra of C 1s and N 1s were deconvoluted by Gaussian-Lorenzian analysis method.For C 1s spectra (Figure 2a), two distinct peaks at 284.8 and 288.0 eV and a low intensity peak at 286.0 eV are observed.The first peak is attributed to sp 2 C-C bonds, and the second one is sp 2 hybridized carbon in N-containing aromatic ring (N-CN), 51,52 while the last peak with low intensity at around 286.0 eV may be ascribed to the C-NH 2 species on the g-C 3 N 4 . 52For N 1s spectra (Figure 2b), four fitted peaks are observed to locate at around 398.3, 399.4,400.7, and 403.9 eV, respectively.These peaks can be regarded as the sp 2 hybridized nitrogen involved in triazine rings (C-NC), the tertiary nitrogen N-(C) 3 groups, the free amino groups (C-N-H), and -excitations, respectively. 24Compared with pure g-C 3 N 4 , N 1s peaks except the -excitation one have about 0.4 shifts to higher binding energies.By contrast, the deconvoluted C 1s peaks have only a slight shift. To further probe the chemical states of Bi and I elements, the high resolution Bi 4f and I 3d XPS spectra for pure BiOI and 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 material were also deconvoluted by curve fitting method.Two strong peaks at 164.3 and 159.0 eV as well as two satellite peaks at 165.4 and 160.0 eV were detected in the composite, as shown in Figure 2c.The strong peaks, lower than those of pure BiOI, are attributed to the characteristic of Bi 4f 5/2 and Bi 4f 7/2 of Bi(III), as reported in other BiOI-based system. 53Similar shifts are also observed in the high-resolution I 3d spectra (Figure 2d).Two conspicuous peaks are available at binding energies of 618.3 eV for I 3d 5/2 and 629.8 eV for I 3d 3/2 , 54 both of which have a shift of 0.5-0.6 eV to low energy region compared with those of pure BiOI. The O 1s peak (Figure S3) was deconvoluted into three components, centered at 529.2, 531.9, and 533.4 eV, respectively.Two peaks at around 531.9 and 533.4 eV are related to absorbed H 2 O molecule and hydroxyl group on the surface. 55,56The lowest binding energy of O 1s at 529.2 eV is regarded as the Bi-O bond in Bi 2 O 2 slabs of BiOI, 57 which has about 0.4 shifts to low binding energies compared with that of pure BiOI.All the shifts for binding energy in the XPS spectra can be attributed to the intense interaction between closely contacted phases of BiOI and g-C 3 N 4 , implying that the hetero junctions have been formed in the as-synthesized composite. 58EM was used to investigate the morphology and microstructure of the synthesized catalysts.Figure 3 shows the TEM images of g-C 3 N 4 and the typical 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composite.It can be seen that the morphology of pure g-C 3 N 4 (Figure 3a) shows a characteristic crumpled layered structure.For the composite, it is observed that BiOI particles are uniformly deposited on the surface of g-C 3 N 4 (Figure 3b).To observe more clearly the microstructure of the composite, the highresolution TEM image of area e in Figure 3b is shown in Figure 3c.A lattice spacing of 0.301 nm is determined, which is attributed to the (102) facet of BiOI.The lattice fringes of g-C 3 N 4 , however, are not observed clearly due to its weak crystallization.Nevertheless, the EDX pattern of area k contains C, N, O, and Cu elements, while that of area m includes not only C, N, O, and Cu elements but also Bi and I (Figure 3d and3e).The results show that the area m is composed of g-C 3 N 4 and BiOI, implying that BiOI is closely deposited on the surface of g-C 3 N 4 layer in this region.To further explore the detailed elemental distributions, energy mappings of N, Bi, and I over the 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 were constructed (in Figure S4).All elements were uniformly distributed on composite, as confirmed by area elemental detection.From the element mapping analysis, it is observed that BiOI could be uniformly deposited on the entire surface of the g-C 3 N 4 . 3.2.UV-Vis DRS Spectra. Figure 4 shows the UV-Vis adsorption spectra of pure BiOI, g-C 3 N 4 and x-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composites.It is obvious that the absorption wavelengths of pure BiOI, g-C 3 N 4 and all the composites display distinct absorption in the visible-light region.Additionally, the absorption edge of the composites shifts regularly to long wavelength with increasing of BiOI content.The band gaps (E g ) of pure materials were estimated by the plot of (h) 1/2 versus photo energy (h) (Figure S5), considering that both BiOI 59 and g-C 3 N 4 10 are indirect band gap semiconductors.The calculated band gaps of BiOI and g-C 3 N 4 are 1.75 and 2.69 eV, respectively, which agrees well with that of the reported BiOI 60 and g-C 3 N 4 . 61.4.Photocatalytic Performance.The photoreduction CO 2 activities of the prepared photocatalysts were evaluated in the presence of water vapor under visible light irradiation.Figure 5 shows the CO 2 photoreduction yields for the assynthesized composites after 5 h irradiation.The photocatalytic products for pure g-C 3 N 4 include CO, H 2 , and O 2 , while there are no products detectable for pure BiOI.With the increase of the BiOI content in the composites, the yields of H 2 decrease monotonously while those of CO and O 2 increase and reach the maximal yields of 17.9 and 9.8 molg cat -1 , respectively, at 7.4 wt.No other products such as HCOOH, HCHO, or CH 3 OH were detected by either GC or GC-MS analyses.Besides, CH 4 , as a minor product, was detected for the composites with BiOI contents of 5.2, 7.4, and 10.1 wt.The generation of the products may be explained by the formation of heterojunctions between g-C 3 N 4 and BiOI in the composites.With the increase of the BiOI contents, the heterojunctions increase, resulting in the improvement of the yield rates of CO, CH 4 , and O 2 .When the BiOI contents get too high, the BiOI morphology is varied from lamella to the hierarchical microsphere and the specific surface area of the composites decrease (Figure S6 andS7).The efficient heterojunction interface did not increase distinctly whereas the excessive BiOI with narrow band gap would act as the recombination center of photogenerated electrons and holes. 36hus, the drop of the productivity should be ascribed to the decreasing the separation efficiency of electron-hole pairs. Figure 6 shows the photocatalytic CO 2 activities for the optimal 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 sample.As can be seen, the total yields of CH 4 , CO, H 2 , and O 2 are enhanced with the extension of the irradiation time.However, the maximal yield rates of CO, CH 4 and O 2 are found at 3 h irradiation, which attained 4.86, 0.18, and 2.78 molg cat -1 h -1 , respectively (Figure S8).The reduction of the photocatalytic activity may be ascribed to the negative effect of the produced hydrogen peroxide, as shown below. The effect of light intensity and light wavelength on the photoreduction CO 2 activity for 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 catalyst were also investigated and the results are summarized in Table 1.The product yields of CO 2 reduction increase not too much as the wavelength of irradiation light extending from 400-800 to 320-800 nm, probably due to its VLD property of the synthesized composite.Nevertheless, the yields of products, including CH 4 , H 2 , O 2 , and CO, increase with the intensity of illuminating light.As a result, the molar ratio of CH 4 /CO grows from 0 to 7.92 when the light intensity increases from 65 to 260 mWcm -2 .This can be explained in terms of the requisite electron number of generating different products.Consequently, the generation of the CO 2 reduction products is mainly dependent on the intensity of the illumination light. To confirm the role of the heterojunctions, the photocatalytic activity of CO 2 reduction of the mechanical mixtures as contrasts were measured and the results are summarized in Table S2.The yields of CO, CH 4 , and O 2 for the mechanically mixed samples decrease greatly in comparison to their counterparts, indicating that the loosely contacted interfaces are insufficient for photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .Thus, it may be reasonably deduced that the formation of heterojunctions between the interfacial phases are responsible for the enhanced photocatalytic activity of the synthesized composites.To further verify the effect of the heterojunctions, we used g-C 3 N 4 , 2.5-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 , and 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 as catalysts to contrast their photocatalytic activity under different atmosphere (Table 2).Under N 2 /H 2 O atmosphere, the products for all the samples are H 2 and O 2 , and the yields of which decrease with increasing the BiOI contents.When N 2 is replaced by CO 2 , the yields of CO or CH 4 increase with BiOI content, accompanying with the yields of H 2 deceased regularly.The results show that the reaction of CO 2 reduction is competitive to that of H 2 generation and the formation of the heterojunctions is more favorable for CO 2 reduction. On the other hand, we notice that the yield of O 2 for all the composites is lower than that expected whether in N 2 /H 2 O or in CO 2 /H 2 O atmosphere.The discrepancy between the practical yields and the calculated values may be attributed to the kinetically competitive reactions of two-electron water oxidation to hydrogen peroxide. 62To check the existence of the intermediate Reproducibility and durability are critical issues for the longterm use of a catalyst in practical application.In the durability tests, the photoreduction CO 2 of the typical 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 catalyst was repeated for five times, as shown in Figure 7.The results show that the yields of CO, CH 4 , H 2 and O 2 decreased slightly after five cycles.To illustrate the stability of the catalyst, XPS spectra measurements were applied for detecting the change of the chemical composition.It can be seen that the high resolution XPS spectra of C 1s, N 1s, and Bi 4f for 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 after five cycles maintain their peak positions as before reaction, while a small amount of I 3 -ions at 619.1 eV, 63 probably deriving from the oxidation of I -ions, could be identified (Figure S10).To further confirm the existence of I 3 ions, Raman spectra were measured.An obvious peak at 108 cm -1 in Raman spectra becomes stronger gradually, indicating the accumulation of I 3 -ions with recycling (Figure S11). 63Therefore, we assume that it is the accumulation of the -ions that results in the reduction of the recycling performance of the materials.Except for the negative effect, we assume that the detected I 3 -ions play a crucial role on the transfer of the photogenerated electrons across the heterojunctions, as shown below. 3.5.Determination of the Charge Transfer Mode.The band edge positions of the composites are known to influence directly on the reduction and oxidation reactions occurring at the catalyst surface.The band energy alignment of the typical 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composite is determined by combining UPS with XPS and DRS. Figure 8 shows the UPS spectra of g-C 3 N 4 , BiOI, and 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 measured at sample biases (-8.0 V).The valence band position (VB) of pure g-C 3 N 4 was first estimated to be situated at -6.61 eV (vs vacuum), according to the linear intersection method. 64The work function of g-C 3 N 4 was calculated to be 4.18 eV (vs vacuum) and the corresponding Fermi level (E F ) to be -4.18eV (vs vacuum).Considering that the band gap (E g ) of pure g-C 3 N 4 is 2.69 eV, the conduction band position (CB) is located at ca. -3.92 eV (vs.vacuum).Correspondingly, the potentials of E VB and E CB are positioned at 2.17 and -0.52 eV (vs NHE), respectively, based on the relationship between the vacuum energy (E abs ) and the normal electrode potential (E ), E abs -E -4.44. 64imilarly, the values of E VB , E CB , and E F of BiOI are determined to be 2.42, 0.67, and 2.01 eV (vs.NHE) (Table S3). With the formation of the BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 heterostructures, alignment of the Fermi levels is assumed at the interfacial phases of two components. 36The value of apparent E F of the composite can be estimated to be 0.30 eV (vs.NHE) by linear intersection method in the UPS spectrum.Accompanying with the movement of Fermi levels, the CB and VB edge positions for both BiOI and g-C 3 N 4 are shifted upward or downward.In this case, the band offsets of 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunctions can be calculated using XPS core-level (CL) alignment method. 65The XPS core-level and valence band spectra of the pure materials and the 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 heterostructure are shown in Figures 2 andS12, respectively.According to the conventional method, 66 the E VB and E CB for 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composite are calculated to be about 2.17 0.23 and 1.23 0.15 eV (Table S3).Supposing that the possible band bending is neglected 53 and given that the difference values (Dvalue) between CB and E F of g-C 3 N 4 as well as D-values between VB and E F of BiOI remain unchanged for pre-and after-contacting, the VB potential of g-C 3 N 4 in the composite is 2.65 eV and the CB potential of BiOI in the composite is -1.04 eV.The corresponding band structure diagram can thus be schemed and a staggered band alignment heterostructure is constructed, as shown in Figure 9. The direction of the photogenerated charge across the heterojunctions for the synthesized materials can be inferred by coupling the experimental results with the established band alignment (Figure 10).In the present study, the p-type BiOI was deposited on the n-type g-C 3 N 4 surface and the p-n junctions were formed at the interfacial phases, resulting in inner electrical fields established in the direction from the ntype g-C 3 N 4 to p-type BiOI.When exposing to the simulated light, the VB electrons of both g-C 3 N 4 and BiOI could be excited up.The charge transfer at the interfacial phases may follow the double-transfer mechanism 353637 or Z-scheme transfer mode. 3If the double-transfer mechanism is adopted, the reduction reaction would proceed on the CB of g-C 3 N 4 , as well as the oxidation reaction on the VB of BiOI (Figure 10a).According to above results, CO has been produced over 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 under 400-800 nm irradiation with 65 mWcm -2 (Table 2).The contract experiment was carried out under the similar conditions, except the light source using 485-515 nm.Since the specific light excites BiOI solely, the photogenerated electrons would transfer from the CB of BiOI to that of g-C 3 N 4 for CO 2 reduction.No products were detected and hence, the hypothesis of the double-transfer mechanism is invalid.From the enhanced photocatalytic activity, we assume that the charge transfer of the synthesized BiOI/g-C3N4 catalysts takes Zscheme mode under our experimental conditions. To give powerful supports to Z-scheme mode, a series of comparative experiments were conducted using EDTA as scavenging agent to eliminate the photogenerated holes in the process of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.Figure 11 shows the yields of CO, CH 4 , H 2 , and O 2 for the mixtures of the typical 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 catalyst with EDTA after running different times.In comparison with normal catalysts (Figure 7), the H 2 yield has no visible change but the yields of CO and CH 4 have a distinct increase.More obviously, the generation of O 2 is suppressed completely.All these results can be ascribed to the effect of adding EDTA.With the addition of EDTA, the photogenerated holes are scavenged, resulting in more efficient separation of the photogenerated electrons and holes.Ultimately, the generation of O 2 is hindered while the yields of CO and CH 4 are enhanced. On the other hand, the Z-scheme charge transfer would be broken with the addition of the scavenger.In consideration of the extremely reversibility of the I 3 -/I -pair, as demonstrated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests (Figure S13), we suppose that the I 3 -ions act as the electron carriers in the process of the photogenerated electron transfer across the p-n junctions.In this case, the generation of intermediate I 3 -ions was blocked as the scavenger is mixed.The corresponding contrast tests show that the peak at 108 cm -1 in the Raman spectra after different cycles disappeared (Figure S14), implying that the photogenerated electrons across the heterojunction are indeed through the transmitting role of the intermediate I 3 -ions.Under light irradiation, the I -ions near the p-n junctions are oxidized to I 3 -ions by the photogenerated holes of BiOI and simultaneously, the I 3 -ions could be reduced by the photogenerated electrons from g-C 3 N 4 , resulting in the efficient separation of the photogenerated holes and electrons on the side of g-C 3 N 4 and BiOI, respectively.When the holes were scavenged, there will be no I 3 -ions detectable.In order to further confirm the role of the intermediate I 3 ions, we construct Bi 5 O 7 I/g-C 3 N 4 and Bi 2 O 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composites to investigate the effect of the content of I element on the CO 2 reduction.The results show that the reduction of I content in the composite is unfavorable for the reduction of CO 2 (Table S4), implying that the I 3 -intermediate plays an important role in the charge transfer process. Consequently, we conclude that it is the very reversibility of the I 3 -/I -pairs that accelerates the photoinduced electrons and holes quenching consecutively at the interfacial phase and finally, achieves Z-scheme transfer. To provide convincing evidence for the efficient separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, we recorded transient photocurrent responses of pure materials and 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composites over 15 on-off irradiation cycles.Figure 12 shows a comparison of I-t curves for BiOI, g-C 3 N 4 , and 7.4-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composite.The photocurrent response of the composite material can reproducibly increase under each irradiation and quickly recover in the dark.Moreover, the photocurrent responses of the composite increase significantly in comparison with those of pure materials, indicating the higher separation efficiency of electron-hole pairs under simulated solar-light irradiation.Besides, the PL spectra of the BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composite photocatalysts at an excitation wavelength of 365 nm were measured and presented in Figure S15.The results show that that the emission intensity of the composites distinctly decreased weakest intensity at x 7.4, indicating that the efficient separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. 67n the basis of the above XPS and Raman results as well as the powerful evidence from transient photocurrent and photoluminescence spectra, we conclude that the charge transfer mode for the synthesized photocatalysts is in accordance well with the process shown in Figure 10b and the x-BiOI/g-C 3 N 4 composites are a new type of indirect solidstate Z-scheme photocatalyst, which conducts the photogenerated electrons across the interfacial phase through the intermediate I 3 -/I -pairs.3.6.Possible Photocatalytic Mechanism.According to the confirmed charge transfer mode and the detected intermediates, the mechanism of CO 2 reduction is proposed as follows: (2) (3) (5) Since the CB potential of the composites is more negative than that of CO 2 /CO (-0.53 V), H 2 O/H 2 (-0.41 V), and CO 2 /CH 4 (-0.24V) pairs, CO 2 can be reduced to yield CO, H 2 , and CH 4 thermodynamically. 2 However, the generation of CH 4 is more difficult than that of CO because the formation of CO requires 2H /2e -, while the formation of CH 4 needs 8H / 8e -.Therefore, the photoreduction of CO 2 to CO is dynamically favored processes in reality.Under stronger illuminating light intensity, more photogenerated electrons are excited and bigger electron density is obtained on the CB of BiOI side in the composite through the intermediate I 3 -/I - pairs.As a result, not only are CO yields increased but also CH 4 release is added (Table 1). Besides the photogenerated electrons, the role of the concomitantly photogenerated holes cannot be ignored.The holes may react with the adsorbed water molecules to generate oxygen, hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) or hydroxide radicals ( OH) 5 The detection of the intermediate product H 2 O 2 as well as the O 2 yield lower than theoretical value has confirmed experimentally the correctness of the above mechanism.Considering that the VB of the prepared composite catalysts (E VB 2.17 0.23 V) is located below the oxidation potential of water (E (H 2 O/ OH) 2.32 V), the formation of hydroxyl radicals is a thermodynamically favored process.To verify the existence of hydroxyl radicals, PL method was applied by the using TA as a probe molecule. 49Figure S16 presents the PL spectral change of the photocatalysts in the solution of TAOH after different time of illumination.An obvious increase of PL intensity at 425 nm is observed with the extension of the irradiation time.The results show that the hydroxyl radicals are actually generated in the catalytic process and participate in the photocatalytic reactions. The detection of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) and hydroxide radicals has confirmed experimentally the correctness of the above mechanism of CO 2 reduction."}], "reactor type": [], "operation mode": []}}
