To evaluate the products formed in the liquid phase, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC-LC-20AD, Shimadzu) was used.After 24 h of reaction, aliquots of 20 L were injected into an Aminex HPX-87H column (300 x 7.8 mm) and kept at a constant temperature of 40 C capable of analyzing carboxylic acids and alcohols, in dilute H 2 SO 4 solution (0.33 mmol L -1 ) as a mobile phase at 0.6 mL min -1 .The experiment of CO 2 reduction over 48 h was performed with the TiO 2 /MgO 1 nanocomposite and aliquots were withdrawn for the liquid phase analysis over this period.This chromatograph is equipped with a differential refractive index detector (RID-10A) suitable for alcohols, while a UV-vis detector (SPD-20A, 210 nm) with deuterium lamp suitable for carboxylic acids."}], "lamp": [{"llm generation": "PHILIPS 5 W", "source": "The CO 2 photoreduction reaction occurred in a 225 mL-capacity cylindrical steel reactor, covered with borosilicate glass under UVC light (PHILIPS 5 W), with a maximum wavelength of 253.7 nm (0.167 mW/cm 2 ) (Fig. S1).", "context": "MgO was obtained by annealing treatment of the MgO(NO 3 ) 2 .6H 2 O (Synth/P.A.) at 500 C for 2 h with a heating rate of 3 C min -1 .TiO 2 nanorices were obtained using a two-step hydrothermal method.In the first step, TiO 2 P25 (Degussa) was dispersed in alkaline solution of NaOH (10 mol L -1 ), placing the capsule in an autoclave, while the hydrothermal treatment was performed at 140 C for 24 h.Thereafter, the produced sodium titanate was subjected to a second hydrothermal process at 200 C for 12 h.Finally, the produced TiO 2 nanorices were centrifuged, washed and dried at 50 C overnight.For the synthesis of the TiO 2 /MgO nanocomposite, the two oxides previously obtained were mixed in different mass proportions of 1.0, 2.0 and 5.0 (w/w) and then calcined at 150 C for 2 h at a heating rate of 3 C min -1 , which were referred to as TiO 2 /MgO 1, TiO 2 /MgO 2 and TiO 2 /MgO 5, respectively. The morphology of the samples was obtained by field emission gun scanning electron microscopy (FEGSEM) JEOL JSM 6701 F. The crystalline phase of TiO 2 and nanocomposites powder were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using CuK radiation in the 2 range from 20 to 80, employing a Shimadzu XRD-6000 diffractometer.Raman measurements were obtained with an FT-Raman spectrometer (Bruker RAM II with a Ge detector) equipped with an Nd:YAG.All spectra were acquired at an excitation wavelength of 1064 nm, generating a power of 100 mW at a resolution of 2 cm -1 .The formation of nanocomposites was verified using high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) employing the TECNAI G2 F20 microscope (FEI), operated at 200 kV.Colloid suspensions were dripped onto wetting carbon-coated copper grids and then dried in the air to obtain the images.The microscopy integrated with X-ray energy-dispersive spectroscopy (XEDS) was also employed for elementary characterization of the nanocomposite containing 1 magnesium (TiO 2 /MgO 1).Diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) in the ultraviolet-visible region were recorded between 200 and 800 nm, at room temperature, using a Cary 5 G instrument (Varian) operated in diffuse reflectance mode to determine the band gap of the materials.The zeta potentials of the TiO 2 /MgO 1 nanocomposite and TiO 2 pure were determined with a Zeta Sizer nano-ZS instrument (Malvern Instruments) in the pH range from 9 to 2, with the pH adjusted by adding 0.1 mol L -1 HCl or 0.1 mol L -1 NaOH.The surface composition and elemental chemical state of the co-obtained sample were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) using a K-Alpha XPS instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific, UK).The incident radiation used was Al K X-rays, 10 -8 mbar of vacuum, and with charge compensation during the measurements.Surveys and highresolution spectra were recorded using a pass energy of 1 eV, with 5 scans and 0.1 eV with 50 scans, respectively.The binding energy was referenced to the C 1s peak at 284.7 eV.A data analysis was performed using Casa XPS software.The specific surface area values were calculated using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method and pore size distribution were determined from the adsorption branch of the isotherm using the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method.Samples were previously degassed at 80 C under vacuum until a degassing pressure 10 mHg and N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms were measured with a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 analyzer at 77 K. Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) for in situ adsorption of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) were obtained in a Thermo Nicolet 4700 Nexus FT-IR Spectrophotometer with MCT-B Detector (Mercury Teluride Cadmium) using a DRIFTS cell from Harrick Scientific with a CaF 2 window.The spectra were collected with 30 scans and 4 cm -1 resolution.Initially, samples were pretreated with a flow of 40 mL min -1 N 2 for 30 min at 25 C.Then, the in situ adsorption step was commenced with a flow of 15 mL min -1 of CO 2 at 25 C collecting spectra every 1 min.After complete saturation of the medium with CO 2 , the desorption of the species was carried out with 40 mL min -1 of N 2 at room temperature until the signal stabilized, collecting the spectra every 1 min up to 5 min. The CO 2 photoreduction reaction occurred in a 225 mL-capacity cylindrical steel reactor, covered with borosilicate glass under UVC light (PHILIPS 5 W), with a maximum wavelength of 253.7 nm (0.167 mW/cm 2 ) (Fig. S1).Samples of 100 mg of the nanocomposites or pure TiO 2 were dispersed in 100 mL of distilled water or in 100 mL of NaOH (0.1 mol L -1 ) solution that was constantly stirred.Before starting the reaction, high-purity CO 2 gas was bubbled for 20 min to saturate the reactor and ensure that all the oxygen had been eliminated.
