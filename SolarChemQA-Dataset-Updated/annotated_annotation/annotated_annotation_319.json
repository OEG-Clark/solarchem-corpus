Pure Bi 2 WO 6 was synthesized by a modied hydrothermal method. 51The g-C 3 N 4 /Bi 2 WO 6 photocatalysts were obtained by a hydrothermal method using the above mentioned g-C 3 N 4 and precursors of Bi 2 WO 6 .In a typical procedure, 0.3299 g Na 2 -WO 4 2H 2 O and different amounts of g-C 3 N 4 (from 0.05 g to 0.3 g) were mixed in 50 mL deionized water, followed by an ultrasound treatment for 20 min to obtain a uniform suspension.Meanwhile, 0.9701 g Bi(NO 3 ) 3 5H 2 O was added to 5 mL 1 M HNO 3 to form a clear solution under stirring at room temperature.The Na 2 WO 4 and g-C 3 N 4 solution was then dropped into Bi(NO 3 ) 3 solution under vigorous stirring.Finally, 2 mL of oleyl amine (C 18 H 37 N) and 270 mL of NH 3 2H 2 O were added into the above mixed solution.The obtained mixed solution was then placed in a 100 mL Teon-lined autoclave.The resulting samples were collected by centrifugation, washed several times with cyclohexane and deionized water and lyophilized overnight.According to this method, a series of g-C 3 N 4 /Bi 2 WO 6 photocatalysts with various mass ratios of g-C 3 N 4 to Bi 2 WO 6 were prepared and denoted as g-C 3 N 4 -x/Bi 2 WO 6 , where x refers to the weight of the added g-C 3 N 4 .The inuences of hydrothermal temperature and time on the photocatalytic activity were also investigated. For photocatalyst characterization, the crystallinity of the powders was recorded by a Rigaku D/Max 2200 PC X-ray diffractometer (XRD) with a scanning rate of 4 min A1 .The X-ray tube using Cu Ka radiation was operated at 40 kV and 40 mA.The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specic surface area of the samples was characterized using a Micromeritics Tristar 2000 instrument at 77 K. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, energy dispersive spectra and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns were obtained by a JEM-2100F eld emission transmission electron microscope operated at 200 kV.Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) images were acquired with a Hitachi S-4800.The UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded in the range of 200-800 nm with a UV-3101 PC Shimadzu spectroscope using BaSO 4 as a reference.A Hitachi F-4500 was used to analyze the catalysts' photoluminescence (PL) characteristics with an excitation wavelength of 370 nm at room temperature.X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out with a Thermo Scientic ESCALAB 250 spectrometer with an Al Ka radiation line source.All the binding energies for the high-resolution spectra were calibrated by setting C 1s to 285 eV.Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were obtained with a Nicolet iZ10 FTIR spectrometer at a resolution of 4 cm A1 .A total of 64 scans were performed to obtain each spectrum. Electrochemical measurements were carried out on a CHI 660A electrochemical workstation (Chenhua Instrument, Inc.) with a conventional three-electrode cell.Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) deposited with photocatalysts served as a working electrode, while the counter and the reference electrodes were a platinum wire and Ag/AgCl respectively, with 0.1 M Na 2 SO 4 as electrolyte solution.The working electrodes were prepared by electrophoretic deposition in an acetone solution (15 mL) containing g-C 3 N 4 /Bi 2 WO 6 , Bi 2 WO 6 or g-C 3 N 4 powder (12 mg) and iodine (3 mg). 53The FTO glass was kept in the above solution for 3 min with a 10 V bias under potentiostat control.All the samples are deposited as thin lms onto FTO by electrophoretic deposition.Aer being calcined for 2 h in an oven at 150 C, a homogeneous lm was obtained.50 mL of 0.1 M Na 2 SO 4 was used as electrolyte solution, which represented the best compromise between activity and stability of the composites. During the Mott-Schottky test, a Pt wire and an Ag/AgCl electrode were also used as the counter and reference electrodes respectively.The working electrode was prepared as follows, 54 with an area of about 1 cm 2 .80 mg of Bi 2 WO 6 , 10 mg of carbon black and 10 mg of polyvinylidene uoride binder were mixed in ethanol.Aer being dried in an oven at 80 C overnight, 10 mg of the mixture was pasted onto a nickel foam current collector.Mott-Schottky plots were generated with a frequency of 962 Hz. The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 was performed in batches by using a reactor (volume: 500 mL) purchased from Perfect-Light Company (Beijing, China).The reactor is made of borosilicate glass, with an optical quartz window at the top, and the distance from the plate to the window is 11 cm.To remove possible trace organic contaminants, all the samples were treated at 200 C for 3 h in air.In a typical process, 0.1 g photocatalyst was uniformly dispersed on a at quartz plate with an area of 4 cm 2 .In order to ensure that air was eliminated, highpurity CO 2 (99.99) gas, monitored by a mass ow controller, was passed through a water bubbler to generate a mixture of CO 2 and water vapor, and then owed through the reactor for about half an hour before the light irradiation.A 300 W xenonarc lamp (Aulight CEL-HX, Beijing) with a 420 nm cutoff lter was used as a light source.The temperature of the reactor was controlled at 25 C by cooling water circulation.The concentration of products in the gas phase was monitored by periodical sampling from the glass chamber by using a gas-tight syringe and 1 mL of the reaction product was taken from the glass chamber at given time intervals (1 h).Each sample was analyzed by GC (Fuli GC-2060) with a ame ionization detector equipped with a 5A molecular column and a TDX-01 packed column to detect hydrocarbons and GC (Techcomp GC-7900) equipped with a thermal conductive detector and a 5A molecular sieve column to detect O 2 and/or H 2 in the outlet gases.CO was detected by installing a methanizer, using N 2 as the carrier gas.During the photostability measurements, the glass setup was purged by high-purity N 2 several times, followed by a mixture of CO 2 and H 2 O vapor in each run.Besides, the effect of H 2 O presence in the photocatalytic system was also studied by using dry CO 2 feed gas and reducing the water molecule adsorption on the sample surface as far as possible."}, {"llm generation": "Bi 2 WO 6", "source": "It is clear that the photocurrent intensity of g-C 3 N 4 -0.1/Bi 2 WO 6 (1.25 mA cm A2 ) is more than two times that of pure Bi 2 WO 6 (0.55 mA cm A2 ) under visible irradiation, indicating that the composite sample may achieve more effective charge separation and photocatalytic activity than the single components.", "context": "The XRD patterns of the synthesized g-C 3 N 4 /Bi 2 WO 6 composites, as well as those of pure g-C 3 N 4 and Bi 2 WO 6 , are shown in Fig. 1.The XRD peaks at 33 and 28 of the pure Bi 2 WO 6 can be indexed to the (200) and (113) reections of its orthorhombic phase (JCPDS 73-1126), respectively. 50No impurity peaks are found.The higher intensity ratio of (200) or (020) peak to the (113) peak than the standard value indicates preferential anisotropic growth along the 001 direction.Two signicant peaks at 27.4 and 13.1 can be seen in the pattern of pure g-C 3 N 4 , which can be indexed as the (002) and (100) reections, respectively, corresponding to the interlayer stacking and inplane structure packing motif of aromatic segments. 55,56The diffraction patterns of the g-C 3 N 4 /Bi 2 WO 6 samples are similar to that of the pure Bi 2 WO 6 , indicating that the addition of g-C 3 N 4 does not have a notable inuence on the crystalline structure of Bi 2 WO 6 . In order to analyze the textural properties of these samples, the nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms at 77 K were analyzed.In Fig. 2, typical H4 hysteresis loops can be observed at P/P 0 14 0.9-1.0,which is characteristic of a mesoporous structure.The calculated BET specic surface area of g-C 3 N 4 is 71.6 m 2 g A1 , while that of pure Bi 2 WO 6 is as low as 4.1 m 2 g A1 .The BET specic surface area of the composites gradually increases with increasing content of g-C 3 N 4 , and the specic surface areas of g-C 3 N 4 -0.05/Bi 2 WO 6 , g-C 3 N 4 -0.1/Bi 2 WO 6 , g-C 3 N 4 -0.15/Bi 2 WO 6 , and g-C 3 N 4 -0.2/Bi 2 WO 6 samples are 8.7, 9.1, 18.0, and 25.2 m 2 g A1 , respectively.FE-SEM and TEM were used to observe the morphology and microstructure of the samples.As shown in Fig. 3a, a typical aggregated morphology with a large size and lamellar structure can be found for the pure g-C 3 N 4 sample.Amounts of Bi 2 WO 6 nanoakes are deposited on the surface of g-C 3 N 4 (Fig. 3b andc).The element mappings (ESI Fig. S1 The optical property of g-C 3 N 4 /Bi 2 WO 6 heterostructures was characterized using UV-visible diffuse reectance spectroscopy.All the samples absorb UV to visible light as expected (Fig. 4a), which signies their visible-light-induced photocatalytic activity.Compared with pure Bi 2 WO 6 , the composites show a much stronger absorption within the visible light range and a red shi appears upon the addition of g-C 3 N 4 powder.The intensity increases with increasing g-C 3 N 4 content.The pure Bi 2 WO 6 sample shows an absorption edge of 445 nm corresponding to a band gap of 2.75 eV.The absorption onset of the g-C 3 N 4 is at 461 nm, corresponding to a band gap of 2.69 eV.Photoluminescence (PL) analysis was performed to study the interfacial charge transfer and the separation efficiency of photogenerated electrons and holes in the g-C 3 N 4 /Bi 2 WO 6 composites. 57The PL spectra of g-C 3 N 4 and all the composites are shown in Fig. 4b.All the PL spectra of the photocatalysts show a broad peak centered at around 460 nm with a tail extending to 650 nm.The emission could be attributed to the band-band PL phenomenon due to the down-transfer of the photoinduced charge carriers of g-C 3 N 4 . 58,59Fig. 4b demonstrates the lowest emission intensity, i.e., the lowest recombination efficiency, is shown by g-C 3 N 4 -0.1/Bi 2 WO 6 among the asprepared composites. Mott-Schottky tests were carried out in order to further conrm the electronic potentials of g-C 3 N 4 and Bi 2 WO 6 , as shown in Fig. 5.The measured potentials can be converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale via the Nernst equation: where E RHE is the converted potential vs. RHE, E Ag/AgCl is the experimental potential measured against the Ag/AgCl reference electrode, and E 0 Ag/AgCl is the standard potential of Ag/AgCl at 298 K (0.1976 V).The calculated conduction band edges of g-C 3 N 4 and Bi 2 WO 6 are A0.82 eV and A1.02 eV, respectively.Such a VB edge downshi is also evidenced in the VB XPS of g-C 3 N 4 and Bi 2 WO 6 as shown in Fig. S2. A signicant shi towards the negative direction can be conrmed, though the observed data of the two characterizations above are not the same. 60he excitation and transfer of photogenerated charge carriers in the samples were qualitatively investigated by photoelectrochemical measurements.Fig. 6 shows the photocurrent responses of g-C 3 N 4 , g-C 3 N 4 -0.1/Bi 2 WO 6 and Bi 2 WO 6 during three on-off cycles.It is clear that the photocurrent intensity of g-C 3 N 4 -0.1/Bi 2 WO 6 (1.25 mA cm A2 ) is more than two times that of pure Bi 2 WO 6 (0.55 mA cm A2 ) under visible irradiation, indicating that the composite sample may achieve more effective charge separation and photocatalytic activity than the single components. To further investigate the interaction between g-C 3 N 4 and Bi 2 WO 6 , XPS spectra were recorded and are shown in Fig. 7. Two peaks with binding energy values of 467.5 and 443.2 eV can be ascribed to the signals of Bi 4d 3/2 and 4d 5/2 , respectively, as shown in Fig. 7a.The C 1s spectrum shown in Fig. 7b can be deconvoluted into two peaks at 285.0 and 288.2 eV, which can be respectively ascribed to the C-C coordination of the surface adventitious carbon and sp 3 -bonded C in C-N of g-C 3 N 4 . 61eanwhile, only one peak corresponding to adventitious carbon has been detected in the pure Bi 2 WO 6 sample.The two peaks in the O 1s spectrum at 532.9 and 530.5 eV can be attributed to the absorbed oxygen and the lattice oxygen in the crystalline Bi 2 WO 6 , respectively. 47From the intensity change of the peaks at 532.9 eV, it can be seen that the amount of absorbed oxygen becomes much larger, corresponding to the increased surface area of the g-C 3 N 4 /Bi 2 WO 6 composite compared to Bi 2 WO 6 , as conrmed by BET testing.The W 4f peaks at 37.0 and 34.9 eV and the Bi 4f peaks at 163.9 and 158.7 eV can be seen in Fig. 7d ande. 51Compared with pure Bi 2 WO 6 , the binding energy of Bi 4f of g-C 3 N 4 -0.1/Bi 2 WO 6 exhibits a positive shi, while O 1s shows a negative shi, suggesting possible chemical bonding formation 47 between Bi 2 WO 6 and g-C 3 N 4 in the composite, which is further studied by FTIR spectroscopy in Fig. S3. This interaction is essential to transfer carriers and enhance photocatalytic activity. The photocatalytic activities of the photocatalysts were measured in a gas-closed circulation system operated under ambient pressure with high-purity CO 2 reactant sealed in the system.The product in the gas phase was continually taken from the reaction cell at given intervals (1 h) for subsequent quantitative analysis based on the external standard method and calibration curve.CO was found to be the main product of CO 2 reduction and no other carbonaceous signals were detected.Moreover, O 2 was detected in the outlet gases (Fig. S4 ), and the amounts of O 2 were much larger than that of CO.Besides, a slight decrease in the production rate of O 2 can be found upon prolonged light irradiation, which is similar to the production of CO, suggesting the generation of O 2 from H 2 O splitting by photogenerated holes.The production rates of CO were in mmol g A1 h A1 .Control photocatalytic experiments under identical conditions but in the absence of CO 2 (g-C 3 N 4 -0.1/Bi 2 WO 6 composites under N 2 atmosphere) or light irradiation were performed, in which no CO product could be detected.Additionally, neither CO nor other carbon compounds can be detected without photocatalysts in the reaction system.The negligible amount of CO produced in the absence of CO 2 indicates that the photocatalyst surface is clean. The hydrothermal temperature and time duration for catalyst preparation play a role in mediating the microstructure of the composite, thus changing the activity of the catalysts (Fig. 8a andb).Graphite carbon nitride (g-C 3 N 4 ) will become unstable when the hydrothermal reaction temperature is higher than 180 C, but at the same time, crystalline Bi 2 WO 6 compound will not be produced when the temperature is too low.As a result, the composite prepared at 160 C for 18 h showed the highest activity for CO 2 photocatalytic conversion.Further studies show that the photocatalytic activities of the g-C 3 N 4 /Bi 2 WO 6 samples also vary with the amount of g-C 3 N 4 , as depicted in Fig. 8c.The CO yield over g-C 3 N 4 -0.1/Bi 2 WO 6 prepared at 160 C for 18 h is 4.15 mmol in the eighth hour under visible light irradiation, approximately corresponding to 5.19 mmol g A1 h A1 on average, which is about 22 and 6.4 times that over pure g-C 3 N 4 and Bi 2 WO 6 , respectively.The composites usually show a signicant synergetic effect during the photoreduction reaction. 62The sample g-C 3 N 4 -0.1/Bi 2 WO 6 exhibits the highest CO evolution amount during light irradiation among the asprepared samples, which is in line with the above results that this sample has the strongest visible light absorption and the highest photocurrent density and separation efficiency between electrons and holes.The effect of H 2 O presence in the photocatalytic system was also studied.By using dry CO 2 feed gas and reducing the water molecule adsorption on the sample surface as far as possible, the CO evolution on g-C 3 N 4 -0.1/Bi 2 WO 6 was greatly suppressed, as shown in Fig. S5, implying that H 2 O molecules play a great role in the photoreduction reaction of CO 2 . One can see that the CO amounts over all the composites are enhanced, while a slight decrease in the production rate occurs upon prolonged irradiation (seen in Fig. S6 ).In order to investigate the structural stability in the photoreduction of CO 2 with water vapor, we characterized the structure of a representative composite aer photocatalytic test for 36 h by XRD analysis (Fig. S7 ).The results show that the structure of the used sample does not show signicant changes compared with the fresh sample, which means high structural stability.The possible reasons for the deactivation might be the saturation of the adsorption sites on the catalysts' surface with products and/ or intermediate products. 63,64o investigate the recycling photostability of as-prepared samples, the reaction of CO 2 photoreduction over the sample g-C 3 N 4 -0.1/Bi 2 WO 6 was repeated for three cycles (each for 12 h).Fig. 8d shows the CO evolution on the catalyst during three consecutive runs for 36 h under visible light irradiation with the periodical replacement of fresh CO 2 and H 2 O before each run.Signicant deactivation can be observed along with extending reaction duration.Although the purge by high-purity N 2 before each repeated cycle puried the catalyst and recovered part of active sites on it, CO evolution decreased to 4.29 mmol in the third cycle, about 84 of that of the rst run. Compared with pure Bi 2 WO 6 and g-C 3 N 4 , the photocatalytic activity of CO 2 reduction over the composites is greatly enhanced as described above, which is not found in previous reports.Such an enhancement can be mainly attributed to the band regulation and light sensitization which resulted in the promoted efficient separation of excited electrons (e A ) at the conduction band and holes (h ) at the valence band. As a premise for the effective interaction between components, the band potential matching between them should be ensured during the in situ synthesis of the composites.The resultant conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) of g-C 3 N 4 are more positive than those of Bi 2 WO 6 , which means that the band potentials of g-C 3 N 4 and Bi 2 WO 6 match with each other, which undoubtedly contributes to the enhanced activity of the photocatalysts.In addition to the band potential matching, a variety of favorable properties contribute to the enhanced photocatalytic performance of the synthesized composites.Firstly, the specic surface area of the composite is greatly enlarged by the addition of g-C 3 N 4 , which will be benecial for the effective surface distribution of active sites.Secondly, the introduction of g-C 3 N 4 will effectively promote the adsorption of CO 2 and photocurrent response under visible light irradiation.More importantly, as observed from TEM and FTIR results, the actual and solid conjunction between g-C 3 N 4 and Bi 2 WO 6 in the photocatalysts contributes to the highly efficient separation of photogenerated charge carriers, resulting in the overall remarkable enhancement of photocatalytic activity.XPS analysis conrms that chemical bonding is formed between Bi 2 WO 6 and g-C 3 N 4 , which is essential to transfer carriers and enhance photocatalytic activity. According to the above information, a possible mechanism for the CO 2 photoredcution on g-C 3 N 4 /Bi 2 WO 6 under visible light irradiation was proposed (as shown in Scheme 1).The CB and VB positions of g-C 3 N 4 are at about A0.82 eV and 1.87 eV, while those of Bi 2 WO 6 are at A1.02 eV and 1.73 eV, respectively.Once irradiated by visible light, both g-C 3 N 4 and Bi 2 WO 6 produce photogenerated electron-hole pairs.The holes tend to remain in the VB of g-C 3 N 4 , while the electrons transfer to the VB of Bi 2 WO 6 from the CB of g-C 3 N 4 .This results in an efficient space separation of the photo-induced charge carriers, as illustrated in Scheme 1.In this process both Bi 2 WO 6 and g-C 3 N 4 are activated as manifested by the promoted charge separation or suppressed charge recombination.At the VB of g-C 3 N 4 , H 2 O molecules are oxidized by h to generate O 2 and protons; meanwhile, CO 2 molecules are reduced to CO by e A at the CB of Bi 2 WO 6 under the assistance of the protons.It can be seen that H 2 O molecules are involved both in the oxidation and reduction reactions, and are necessary for the highly efficient photoreduction of CO 2 as shown in Fig. S5, though H 2 O is not consumed during the reactions and only a small amount of water is enough. As no CH 4 was detected in the present reaction, the catalyst is believed to be incapable of stacking the photogenerated electrons.It is known that different structural features of the catalysts and the reaction conditions could lead to different reaction products. 65The electrochemical CO 2 reduction potential versus the NHE at pH 7 is listed in Scheme S1, 1 from which it is easy to nd that eight electrons are necessary for each CH 4 molecule produced in the photoreduction reaction, while only two electrons are needed for each CO molecule.The conversion of CO 2 to CO may be a more dynamically favored process for the CO 2 photoreduction by gaseous water in our system.Therefore, the g-C 3 N 4 -x/Bi 2 WO 6 composites could photoreduce CO 2 to CO with extra high selectivity in this work."}, {"llm generation": "g-C3N4/Bi2WO6", "source": "A novel kind of g-C 3 N 4 /Bi 2 WO 6 has been fabricated using a conventional hydrothermal method.", "context": "A novel kind of g-C 3 N 4 /Bi 2 WO 6 has been fabricated using a conventional hydrothermal method.These composites exhibit signicant visible light sensitivity and highly efficient separation and transfer of charge carriers, i.e., photogenerated electron-hole pairs, across the interface between g-C 3 N 4 and Bi 2 WO 6 .The as-prepared catalysts show greatly enhanced photocatalytic performance in the photoreduction of CO 2 with gaseous water as reducing agent and up to 100 CO selectivity under visible light with no CH 4 or other C1 intermediate products being detected.The optimum photocatalytic CO evolution rate on g-C 3 N 4 -0.1/Bi 2 WO 6 reaches 5.19 mmol g A1 h A1 , around 22 and 6.4 times that on the separate g-C 3 N 4 and Bi 2 WO 6 , respectively.The catalytic stability is not as satisfactory as expected and further investigation on this is in progress.This work shows a promising prospect for the utilization of g-C 3 N 4 / Bi 2 WO 6 as a visible-light-driven photocatalyst for CO 2 photoconversion without the addition of any noble metal co-catalyst.

In order to analyze the textural properties of these samples, the nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms at 77 K were analyzed.In Fig. 2, typical H4 hysteresis loops can be observed at P/P 0 14 0.9-1.0,which is characteristic of a mesoporous structure.The calculated BET specic surface area of g-C 3 N 4 is 71.6 m 2 g A1 , while that of pure Bi 2 WO 6 is as low as 4.1 m 2 g A1 .The BET specic surface area of the composites gradually increases with increasing content of g-C 3 N 4 , and the specic surface areas of g-C 3 N 4 -0.05/Bi 2 WO 6 , g-C 3 N 4 -0.1/Bi 2 WO 6 , g-C 3 N 4 -0.15/Bi 2 WO 6 , and g-C 3 N 4 -0.2/Bi 2 WO 6 samples are 8.7, 9.1, 18.0, and 25.2 m 2 g A1 , respectively.FE-SEM and TEM were used to observe the morphology and microstructure of the samples.As shown in Fig. 3a, a typical aggregated morphology with a large size and lamellar structure can be found for the pure g-C 3 N 4 sample.Amounts of Bi 2 WO 6 nanoakes are deposited on the surface of g-C 3 N 4 (Fig. 3b andc).The element mappings (ESI Fig. S1 The optical property of g-C 3 N 4 /Bi 2 WO 6 heterostructures was characterized using UV-visible diffuse reectance spectroscopy.All the samples absorb UV to visible light as expected (Fig. 4a), which signies their visible-light-induced photocatalytic activity.Compared with pure Bi 2 WO 6 , the composites show a much stronger absorption within the visible light range and a red shi appears upon the addition of g-C 3 N 4 powder.The intensity increases with increasing g-C 3 N 4 content.The pure Bi 2 WO 6 sample shows an absorption edge of 445 nm corresponding to a band gap of 2.75 eV.The absorption onset of the g-C 3 N 4 is at 461 nm, corresponding to a band gap of 2.69 eV.Photoluminescence (PL) analysis was performed to study the interfacial charge transfer and the separation efficiency of photogenerated electrons and holes in the g-C 3 N 4 /Bi 2 WO 6 composites. 57The PL spectra of g-C 3 N 4 and all the composites are shown in Fig. 4b.All the PL spectra of the photocatalysts show a broad peak centered at around 460 nm with a tail extending to 650 nm.The emission could be attributed to the band-band PL phenomenon due to the down-transfer of the photoinduced charge carriers of g-C 3 N 4 . 58,59Fig. 4b demonstrates the lowest emission intensity, i.e., the lowest recombination efficiency, is shown by g-C 3 N 4 -0.1/Bi 2 WO 6 among the asprepared composites. Mott-Schottky tests were carried out in order to further conrm the electronic potentials of g-C 3 N 4 and Bi 2 WO 6 , as shown in Fig. 5.The measured potentials can be converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale via the Nernst equation: where E RHE is the converted potential vs. RHE, E Ag/AgCl is the experimental potential measured against the Ag/AgCl reference electrode, and E 0 Ag/AgCl is the standard potential of Ag/AgCl at 298 K (0.1976 V).The calculated conduction band edges of g-C 3 N 4 and Bi 2 WO 6 are A0.82 eV and A1.02 eV, respectively.Such a VB edge downshi is also evidenced in the VB XPS of g-C 3 N 4 and Bi 2 WO 6 as shown in Fig. S2. A signicant shi towards the negative direction can be conrmed, though the observed data of the two characterizations above are not the same. 60he excitation and transfer of photogenerated charge carriers in the samples were qualitatively investigated by photoelectrochemical measurements.Fig. 6 shows the photocurrent responses of g-C 3 N 4 , g-C 3 N 4 -0.1/Bi 2 WO 6 and Bi 2 WO 6 during three on-off cycles.It is clear that the photocurrent intensity of g-C 3 N 4 -0.1/Bi 2 WO 6 (1.25 mA cm A2 ) is more than two times that of pure Bi 2 WO 6 (0.55 mA cm A2 ) under visible irradiation, indicating that the composite sample may achieve more effective charge separation and photocatalytic activity than the single components. To further investigate the interaction between g-C 3 N 4 and Bi 2 WO 6 , XPS spectra were recorded and are shown in Fig. 7. Two peaks with binding energy values of 467.5 and 443.2 eV can be ascribed to the signals of Bi 4d 3/2 and 4d 5/2 , respectively, as shown in Fig. 7a.The C 1s spectrum shown in Fig. 7b can be deconvoluted into two peaks at 285.0 and 288.2 eV, which can be respectively ascribed to the C-C coordination of the surface adventitious carbon and sp 3 -bonded C in C-N of g-C 3 N 4 . 61eanwhile, only one peak corresponding to adventitious carbon has been detected in the pure Bi 2 WO 6 sample.The two peaks in the O 1s spectrum at 532.9 and 530.5 eV can be attributed to the absorbed oxygen and the lattice oxygen in the crystalline Bi 2 WO 6 , respectively. 47From the intensity change of the peaks at 532.9 eV, it can be seen that the amount of absorbed oxygen becomes much larger, corresponding to the increased surface area of the g-C 3 N 4 /Bi 2 WO 6 composite compared to Bi 2 WO 6 , as conrmed by BET testing.The W 4f peaks at 37.0 and 34.9 eV and the Bi 4f peaks at 163.9 and 158.7 eV can be seen in Fig. 7d ande. 51Compared with pure Bi 2 WO 6 , the binding energy of Bi 4f of g-C 3 N 4 -0.1/Bi 2 WO 6 exhibits a positive shi, while O 1s shows a negative shi, suggesting possible chemical bonding formation 47 between Bi 2 WO 6 and g-C 3 N 4 in the composite, which is further studied by FTIR spectroscopy in Fig. S3. This interaction is essential to transfer carriers and enhance photocatalytic activity. The photocatalytic activities of the photocatalysts were measured in a gas-closed circulation system operated under ambient pressure with high-purity CO 2 reactant sealed in the system.The product in the gas phase was continually taken from the reaction cell at given intervals (1 h) for subsequent quantitative analysis based on the external standard method and calibration curve.CO was found to be the main product of CO 2 reduction and no other carbonaceous signals were detected.Moreover, O 2 was detected in the outlet gases (Fig. S4 ), and the amounts of O 2 were much larger than that of CO.Besides, a slight decrease in the production rate of O 2 can be found upon prolonged light irradiation, which is similar to the production of CO, suggesting the generation of O 2 from H 2 O splitting by photogenerated holes.The production rates of CO were in mmol g A1 h A1 .Control photocatalytic experiments under identical conditions but in the absence of CO 2 (g-C 3 N 4 -0.1/Bi 2 WO 6 composites under N 2 atmosphere) or light irradiation were performed, in which no CO product could be detected.Additionally, neither CO nor other carbon compounds can be detected without photocatalysts in the reaction system.The negligible amount of CO produced in the absence of CO 2 indicates that the photocatalyst surface is clean. The hydrothermal temperature and time duration for catalyst preparation play a role in mediating the microstructure of the composite, thus changing the activity of the catalysts (Fig. 8a andb).Graphite carbon nitride (g-C 3 N 4 ) will become unstable when the hydrothermal reaction temperature is higher than 180 C, but at the same time, crystalline Bi 2 WO 6 compound will not be produced when the temperature is too low.As a result, the composite prepared at 160 C for 18 h showed the highest activity for CO 2 photocatalytic conversion.Further studies show that the photocatalytic activities of the g-C 3 N 4 /Bi 2 WO 6 samples also vary with the amount of g-C 3 N 4 , as depicted in Fig. 8c.The CO yield over g-C 3 N 4 -0.1/Bi 2 WO 6 prepared at 160 C for 18 h is 4.15 mmol in the eighth hour under visible light irradiation, approximately corresponding to 5.19 mmol g A1 h A1 on average, which is about 22 and 6.4 times that over pure g-C 3 N 4 and Bi 2 WO 6 , respectively.The composites usually show a signicant synergetic effect during the photoreduction reaction. 62The sample g-C 3 N 4 -0.1/Bi 2 WO 6 exhibits the highest CO evolution amount during light irradiation among the asprepared samples, which is in line with the above results that this sample has the strongest visible light absorption and the highest photocurrent density and separation efficiency between electrons and holes.The effect of H 2 O presence in the photocatalytic system was also studied.By using dry CO 2 feed gas and reducing the water molecule adsorption on the sample surface as far as possible, the CO evolution on g-C 3 N 4 -0.1/Bi 2 WO 6 was greatly suppressed, as shown in Fig. S5, implying that H 2 O molecules play a great role in the photoreduction reaction of CO 2 . One can see that the CO amounts over all the composites are enhanced, while a slight decrease in the production rate occurs upon prolonged irradiation (seen in Fig. S6 ).In order to investigate the structural stability in the photoreduction of CO 2 with water vapor, we characterized the structure of a representative composite aer photocatalytic test for 36 h by XRD analysis (Fig. S7 ).The results show that the structure of the used sample does not show signicant changes compared with the fresh sample, which means high structural stability.The possible reasons for the deactivation might be the saturation of the adsorption sites on the catalysts' surface with products and/ or intermediate products. 63,64o investigate the recycling photostability of as-prepared samples, the reaction of CO 2 photoreduction over the sample g-C 3 N 4 -0.1/Bi 2 WO 6 was repeated for three cycles (each for 12 h).Fig. 8d shows the CO evolution on the catalyst during three consecutive runs for 36 h under visible light irradiation with the periodical replacement of fresh CO 2 and H 2 O before each run.Signicant deactivation can be observed along with extending reaction duration.Although the purge by high-purity N 2 before each repeated cycle puried the catalyst and recovered part of active sites on it, CO evolution decreased to 4.29 mmol in the third cycle, about 84 of that of the rst run. Compared with pure Bi 2 WO 6 and g-C 3 N 4 , the photocatalytic activity of CO 2 reduction over the composites is greatly enhanced as described above, which is not found in previous reports.Such an enhancement can be mainly attributed to the band regulation and light sensitization which resulted in the promoted efficient separation of excited electrons (e A ) at the conduction band and holes (h ) at the valence band. As a premise for the effective interaction between components, the band potential matching between them should be ensured during the in situ synthesis of the composites.The resultant conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) of g-C 3 N 4 are more positive than those of Bi 2 WO 6 , which means that the band potentials of g-C 3 N 4 and Bi 2 WO 6 match with each other, which undoubtedly contributes to the enhanced activity of the photocatalysts.In addition to the band potential matching, a variety of favorable properties contribute to the enhanced photocatalytic performance of the synthesized composites.Firstly, the specic surface area of the composite is greatly enlarged by the addition of g-C 3 N 4 , which will be benecial for the effective surface distribution of active sites.Secondly, the introduction of g-C 3 N 4 will effectively promote the adsorption of CO 2 and photocurrent response under visible light irradiation.More importantly, as observed from TEM and FTIR results, the actual and solid conjunction between g-C 3 N 4 and Bi 2 WO 6 in the photocatalysts contributes to the highly efficient separation of photogenerated charge carriers, resulting in the overall remarkable enhancement of photocatalytic activity.XPS analysis conrms that chemical bonding is formed between Bi 2 WO 6 and g-C 3 N 4 , which is essential to transfer carriers and enhance photocatalytic activity. According to the above information, a possible mechanism for the CO 2 photoredcution on g-C 3 N 4 /Bi 2 WO 6 under visible light irradiation was proposed (as shown in Scheme 1).The CB and VB positions of g-C 3 N 4 are at about A0.82 eV and 1.87 eV, while those of Bi 2 WO 6 are at A1.02 eV and 1.73 eV, respectively.Once irradiated by visible light, both g-C 3 N 4 and Bi 2 WO 6 produce photogenerated electron-hole pairs.The holes tend to remain in the VB of g-C 3 N 4 , while the electrons transfer to the VB of Bi 2 WO 6 from the CB of g-C 3 N 4 .This results in an efficient space separation of the photo-induced charge carriers, as illustrated in Scheme 1.In this process both Bi 2 WO 6 and g-C 3 N 4 are activated as manifested by the promoted charge separation or suppressed charge recombination.At the VB of g-C 3 N 4 , H 2 O molecules are oxidized by h to generate O 2 and protons; meanwhile, CO 2 molecules are reduced to CO by e A at the CB of Bi 2 WO 6 under the assistance of the protons.It can be seen that H 2 O molecules are involved both in the oxidation and reduction reactions, and are necessary for the highly efficient photoreduction of CO 2 as shown in Fig. S5, though H 2 O is not consumed during the reactions and only a small amount of water is enough. As no CH 4 was detected in the present reaction, the catalyst is believed to be incapable of stacking the photogenerated electrons.It is known that different structural features of the catalysts and the reaction conditions could lead to different reaction products. 65The electrochemical CO 2 reduction potential versus the NHE at pH 7 is listed in Scheme S1, 1 from which it is easy to nd that eight electrons are necessary for each CH 4 molecule produced in the photoreduction reaction, while only two electrons are needed for each CO molecule.The conversion of CO 2 to CO may be a more dynamically favored process for the CO 2 photoreduction by gaseous water in our system.Therefore, the g-C 3 N 4 -x/Bi 2 WO 6 composites could photoreduce CO 2 to CO with extra high selectivity in this work."}, {"llm generation": "gaseous water", "source": "The as-prepared catalysts show greatly enhanced photocatalytic performance in the photoreduction of CO 2 with gaseous water as reducing agent and up to 100 CO selectivity under visible light with no CH 4 or other C1 intermediate products being detected.", "context": "A novel kind of g-C 3 N 4 /Bi 2 WO 6 has been fabricated using a conventional hydrothermal method.These composites exhibit signicant visible light sensitivity and highly efficient separation and transfer of charge carriers, i.e., photogenerated electron-hole pairs, across the interface between g-C 3 N 4 and Bi 2 WO 6 .The as-prepared catalysts show greatly enhanced photocatalytic performance in the photoreduction of CO 2 with gaseous water as reducing agent and up to 100 CO selectivity under visible light with no CH 4 or other C1 intermediate products being detected.The optimum photocatalytic CO evolution rate on g-C 3 N 4 -0.1/Bi 2 WO 6 reaches 5.19 mmol g A1 h A1 , around 22 and 6.4 times that on the separate g-C 3 N 4 and Bi 2 WO 6 , respectively.The catalytic stability is not as satisfactory as expected and further investigation on this is in progress.This work shows a promising prospect for the utilization of g-C 3 N 4 / Bi 2 WO 6 as a visible-light-driven photocatalyst for CO 2 photoconversion without the addition of any noble metal co-catalyst.

In order to analyze the textural properties of these samples, the nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms at 77 K were analyzed.In Fig. 2, typical H4 hysteresis loops can be observed at P/P 0 14 0.9-1.0,which is characteristic of a mesoporous structure.The calculated BET specic surface area of g-C 3 N 4 is 71.6 m 2 g A1 , while that of pure Bi 2 WO 6 is as low as 4.1 m 2 g A1 .The BET specic surface area of the composites gradually increases with increasing content of g-C 3 N 4 , and the specic surface areas of g-C 3 N 4 -0.05/Bi 2 WO 6 , g-C 3 N 4 -0.1/Bi 2 WO 6 , g-C 3 N 4 -0.15/Bi 2 WO 6 , and g-C 3 N 4 -0.2/Bi 2 WO 6 samples are 8.7, 9.1, 18.0, and 25.2 m 2 g A1 , respectively.FE-SEM and TEM were used to observe the morphology and microstructure of the samples.As shown in Fig. 3a, a typical aggregated morphology with a large size and lamellar structure can be found for the pure g-C 3 N 4 sample.Amounts of Bi 2 WO 6 nanoakes are deposited on the surface of g-C 3 N 4 (Fig. 3b andc).The element mappings (ESI Fig. S1 The optical property of g-C 3 N 4 /Bi 2 WO 6 heterostructures was characterized using UV-visible diffuse reectance spectroscopy.All the samples absorb UV to visible light as expected (Fig. 4a), which signies their visible-light-induced photocatalytic activity.Compared with pure Bi 2 WO 6 , the composites show a much stronger absorption within the visible light range and a red shi appears upon the addition of g-C 3 N 4 powder.The intensity increases with increasing g-C 3 N 4 content.The pure Bi 2 WO 6 sample shows an absorption edge of 445 nm corresponding to a band gap of 2.75 eV.The absorption onset of the g-C 3 N 4 is at 461 nm, corresponding to a band gap of 2.69 eV.Photoluminescence (PL) analysis was performed to study the interfacial charge transfer and the separation efficiency of photogenerated electrons and holes in the g-C 3 N 4 /Bi 2 WO 6 composites. 57The PL spectra of g-C 3 N 4 and all the composites are shown in Fig. 4b.All the PL spectra of the photocatalysts show a broad peak centered at around 460 nm with a tail extending to 650 nm.The emission could be attributed to the band-band PL phenomenon due to the down-transfer of the photoinduced charge carriers of g-C 3 N 4 . 58,59Fig. 4b demonstrates the lowest emission intensity, i.e., the lowest recombination efficiency, is shown by g-C 3 N 4 -0.1/Bi 2 WO 6 among the asprepared composites. Mott-Schottky tests were carried out in order to further conrm the electronic potentials of g-C 3 N 4 and Bi 2 WO 6 , as shown in Fig. 5.The measured potentials can be converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale via the Nernst equation: where E RHE is the converted potential vs. RHE, E Ag/AgCl is the experimental potential measured against the Ag/AgCl reference electrode, and E 0 Ag/AgCl is the standard potential of Ag/AgCl at 298 K (0.1976 V).The calculated conduction band edges of g-C 3 N 4 and Bi 2 WO 6 are A0.82 eV and A1.02 eV, respectively.Such a VB edge downshi is also evidenced in the VB XPS of g-C 3 N 4 and Bi 2 WO 6 as shown in Fig. S2. A signicant shi towards the negative direction can be conrmed, though the observed data of the two characterizations above are not the same. 60he excitation and transfer of photogenerated charge carriers in the samples were qualitatively investigated by photoelectrochemical measurements.Fig. 6 shows the photocurrent responses of g-C 3 N 4 , g-C 3 N 4 -0.1/Bi 2 WO 6 and Bi 2 WO 6 during three on-off cycles.It is clear that the photocurrent intensity of g-C 3 N 4 -0.1/Bi 2 WO 6 (1.25 mA cm A2 ) is more than two times that of pure Bi 2 WO 6 (0.55 mA cm A2 ) under visible irradiation, indicating that the composite sample may achieve more effective charge separation and photocatalytic activity than the single components. To further investigate the interaction between g-C 3 N 4 and Bi 2 WO 6 , XPS spectra were recorded and are shown in Fig. 7. Two peaks with binding energy values of 467.5 and 443.2 eV can be ascribed to the signals of Bi 4d 3/2 and 4d 5/2 , respectively, as shown in Fig. 7a.The C 1s spectrum shown in Fig. 7b can be deconvoluted into two peaks at 285.0 and 288.2 eV, which can be respectively ascribed to the C-C coordination of the surface adventitious carbon and sp 3 -bonded C in C-N of g-C 3 N 4 . 61eanwhile, only one peak corresponding to adventitious carbon has been detected in the pure Bi 2 WO 6 sample.The two peaks in the O 1s spectrum at 532.9 and 530.5 eV can be attributed to the absorbed oxygen and the lattice oxygen in the crystalline Bi 2 WO 6 , respectively. 47From the intensity change of the peaks at 532.9 eV, it can be seen that the amount of absorbed oxygen becomes much larger, corresponding to the increased surface area of the g-C 3 N 4 /Bi 2 WO 6 composite compared to Bi 2 WO 6 , as conrmed by BET testing.The W 4f peaks at 37.0 and 34.9 eV and the Bi 4f peaks at 163.9 and 158.7 eV can be seen in Fig. 7d ande. 51Compared with pure Bi 2 WO 6 , the binding energy of Bi 4f of g-C 3 N 4 -0.1/Bi 2 WO 6 exhibits a positive shi, while O 1s shows a negative shi, suggesting possible chemical bonding formation 47 between Bi 2 WO 6 and g-C 3 N 4 in the composite, which is further studied by FTIR spectroscopy in Fig. S3. This interaction is essential to transfer carriers and enhance photocatalytic activity. The photocatalytic activities of the photocatalysts were measured in a gas-closed circulation system operated under ambient pressure with high-purity CO 2 reactant sealed in the system.The product in the gas phase was continually taken from the reaction cell at given intervals (1 h) for subsequent quantitative analysis based on the external standard method and calibration curve.CO was found to be the main product of CO 2 reduction and no other carbonaceous signals were detected.Moreover, O 2 was detected in the outlet gases (Fig. S4 ), and the amounts of O 2 were much larger than that of CO.Besides, a slight decrease in the production rate of O 2 can be found upon prolonged light irradiation, which is similar to the production of CO, suggesting the generation of O 2 from H 2 O splitting by photogenerated holes.The production rates of CO were in mmol g A1 h A1 .Control photocatalytic experiments under identical conditions but in the absence of CO 2 (g-C 3 N 4 -0.1/Bi 2 WO 6 composites under N 2 atmosphere) or light irradiation were performed, in which no CO product could be detected.Additionally, neither CO nor other carbon compounds can be detected without photocatalysts in the reaction system.The negligible amount of CO produced in the absence of CO 2 indicates that the photocatalyst surface is clean. The hydrothermal temperature and time duration for catalyst preparation play a role in mediating the microstructure of the composite, thus changing the activity of the catalysts (Fig. 8a andb).Graphite carbon nitride (g-C 3 N 4 ) will become unstable when the hydrothermal reaction temperature is higher than 180 C, but at the same time, crystalline Bi 2 WO 6 compound will not be produced when the temperature is too low.As a result, the composite prepared at 160 C for 18 h showed the highest activity for CO 2 photocatalytic conversion.Further studies show that the photocatalytic activities of the g-C 3 N 4 /Bi 2 WO 6 samples also vary with the amount of g-C 3 N 4 , as depicted in Fig. 8c.The CO yield over g-C 3 N 4 -0.1/Bi 2 WO 6 prepared at 160 C for 18 h is 4.15 mmol in the eighth hour under visible light irradiation, approximately corresponding to 5.19 mmol g A1 h A1 on average, which is about 22 and 6.4 times that over pure g-C 3 N 4 and Bi 2 WO 6 , respectively.The composites usually show a signicant synergetic effect during the photoreduction reaction. 62The sample g-C 3 N 4 -0.1/Bi 2 WO 6 exhibits the highest CO evolution amount during light irradiation among the asprepared samples, which is in line with the above results that this sample has the strongest visible light absorption and the highest photocurrent density and separation efficiency between electrons and holes.The effect of H 2 O presence in the photocatalytic system was also studied.By using dry CO 2 feed gas and reducing the water molecule adsorption on the sample surface as far as possible, the CO evolution on g-C 3 N 4 -0.1/Bi 2 WO 6 was greatly suppressed, as shown in Fig. S5, implying that H 2 O molecules play a great role in the photoreduction reaction of CO 2 . One can see that the CO amounts over all the composites are enhanced, while a slight decrease in the production rate occurs upon prolonged irradiation (seen in Fig. S6 ).In order to investigate the structural stability in the photoreduction of CO 2 with water vapor, we characterized the structure of a representative composite aer photocatalytic test for 36 h by XRD analysis (Fig. S7 ).The results show that the structure of the used sample does not show signicant changes compared with the fresh sample, which means high structural stability.The possible reasons for the deactivation might be the saturation of the adsorption sites on the catalysts' surface with products and/ or intermediate products. 63,64o investigate the recycling photostability of as-prepared samples, the reaction of CO 2 photoreduction over the sample g-C 3 N 4 -0.1/Bi 2 WO 6 was repeated for three cycles (each for 12 h).Fig. 8d shows the CO evolution on the catalyst during three consecutive runs for 36 h under visible light irradiation with the periodical replacement of fresh CO 2 and H 2 O before each run.Signicant deactivation can be observed along with extending reaction duration.Although the purge by high-purity N 2 before each repeated cycle puried the catalyst and recovered part of active sites on it, CO evolution decreased to 4.29 mmol in the third cycle, about 84 of that of the rst run. Compared with pure Bi 2 WO 6 and g-C 3 N 4 , the photocatalytic activity of CO 2 reduction over the composites is greatly enhanced as described above, which is not found in previous reports.Such an enhancement can be mainly attributed to the band regulation and light sensitization which resulted in the promoted efficient separation of excited electrons (e A ) at the conduction band and holes (h ) at the valence band. As a premise for the effective interaction between components, the band potential matching between them should be ensured during the in situ synthesis of the composites.The resultant conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) of g-C 3 N 4 are more positive than those of Bi 2 WO 6 , which means that the band potentials of g-C 3 N 4 and Bi 2 WO 6 match with each other, which undoubtedly contributes to the enhanced activity of the photocatalysts.In addition to the band potential matching, a variety of favorable properties contribute to the enhanced photocatalytic performance of the synthesized composites.Firstly, the specic surface area of the composite is greatly enlarged by the addition of g-C 3 N 4 , which will be benecial for the effective surface distribution of active sites.Secondly, the introduction of g-C 3 N 4 will effectively promote the adsorption of CO 2 and photocurrent response under visible light irradiation.More importantly, as observed from TEM and FTIR results, the actual and solid conjunction between g-C 3 N 4 and Bi 2 WO 6 in the photocatalysts contributes to the highly efficient separation of photogenerated charge carriers, resulting in the overall remarkable enhancement of photocatalytic activity.XPS analysis conrms that chemical bonding is formed between Bi 2 WO 6 and g-C 3 N 4 , which is essential to transfer carriers and enhance photocatalytic activity. According to the above information, a possible mechanism for the CO 2 photoredcution on g-C 3 N 4 /Bi 2 WO 6 under visible light irradiation was proposed (as shown in Scheme 1).The CB and VB positions of g-C 3 N 4 are at about A0.82 eV and 1.87 eV, while those of Bi 2 WO 6 are at A1.02 eV and 1.73 eV, respectively.Once irradiated by visible light, both g-C 3 N 4 and Bi 2 WO 6 produce photogenerated electron-hole pairs.The holes tend to remain in the VB of g-C 3 N 4 , while the electrons transfer to the VB of Bi 2 WO 6 from the CB of g-C 3 N 4 .This results in an efficient space separation of the photo-induced charge carriers, as illustrated in Scheme 1.In this process both Bi 2 WO 6 and g-C 3 N 4 are activated as manifested by the promoted charge separation or suppressed charge recombination.At the VB of g-C 3 N 4 , H 2 O molecules are oxidized by h to generate O 2 and protons; meanwhile, CO 2 molecules are reduced to CO by e A at the CB of Bi 2 WO 6 under the assistance of the protons.It can be seen that H 2 O molecules are involved both in the oxidation and reduction reactions, and are necessary for the highly efficient photoreduction of CO 2 as shown in Fig. S5, though H 2 O is not consumed during the reactions and only a small amount of water is enough. As no CH 4 was detected in the present reaction, the catalyst is believed to be incapable of stacking the photogenerated electrons.It is known that different structural features of the catalysts and the reaction conditions could lead to different reaction products. 65The electrochemical CO 2 reduction potential versus the NHE at pH 7 is listed in Scheme S1, 1 from which it is easy to nd that eight electrons are necessary for each CH 4 molecule produced in the photoreduction reaction, while only two electrons are needed for each CO molecule.The conversion of CO 2 to CO may be a more dynamically favored process for the CO 2 photoreduction by gaseous water in our system.Therefore, the g-C 3 N 4 -x/Bi 2 WO 6 composites could photoreduce CO 2 to CO with extra high selectivity in this work."}]}}
