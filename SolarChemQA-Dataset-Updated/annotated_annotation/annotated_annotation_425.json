First, 1.3821 g K 2 CO 3 and 1.8744 g commercial Ga 2 O 3 were evenly mixed, and calcined at 900 C for 16 h to obtain pure KGaO 2 .Then, 1.1264 g KGaO 2 was added into 150 ml water to obtain a clear solution, followed by adding 0.48 g acetic acid slowly.And the solution was stirred under ambient conditions for half an hour, and then kept in a water bath at 80 C for 3 h to obtain GaOOH.Then, the as-prepared GaOOH was calcined at 800 C for 2 h with 50 sccm oxygen flow to obtain -Ga 2 O 3 nanosheet. The ZnGaNO nanotube was synthesized by nitriding a mixture of the as-prepared ZnO nanorod and Ga 2 O 3 nanosheet at 800 C for 5 h at 500 sccm NH 3 flow, followed by loading 0.5 wt Pt as a cocatalyst by the impregnation method. The ZnGaNO-SSR was synthesized by nitriding a mixture of ZnO and Ga 2 O 3 at 850 C for 15 h, followed by loading 0.5 wt Pt as a cocatalyst by the impregnation method. The crystal phase of the derived sample was determined by using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Rigaku Ultima III, Japan) operated at 20 kV and 40 mA with Cu-K radiation.Diffuse reflectance spectrum was scanned by using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (UV-2500, Shimadzu Co., Japan) and transformed into an absorption spectrum with the Kubelka-Munk relationship.The specific surface area was measured on nitrogen adsorption at -196 C by using an automatic surface area analyzer (Micromeritics Tristar-3000, USA) after the samples had been dehydrated in N 2 flow at 150 C for 3 h.The surface morphology was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, FEI Nova Nano SEM 230, USA).TEM images and selected area electron diffraction patterns (SAED) were obtained by employing a transmission electron microscope (TEM, FEI Tecnai G2 F30 S-Twin, USA) operated at 200 kV.The transmission infrared spectra were recorded by Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR spectrometer, NEXUS870, Nicolet, USA) under ambient conditions. The photocatalytic CO 2 reaction was carried out in a glass reactor with an area of 4.2 cm 2 .The light source was a 300 W xenon arc lamp from PerfectLight Company, and to obtain visible irradiation, a 420 nm filter was employed.The volume of the reaction chamber was about 230 ml.Before the reaction, the chamber was evacuated several times and then high purity CO 2 gas was introduced into the reaction chamber to achieve ambient pressure.0.4 ml deionized water was injected into the chamber as the reactant.During the reaction, 1 ml gas was extracted from the chamber by using a sampling needle at given intervals for subsequent CH 4 concentration analysis with gas chromatography (GC-2014, Shimadzu Corp., Japan)."}, {"llm generation": "ZnGaNO nanotubes", "source": "The photocatalytic performance of the as-prepared ZnGaNO nanotubes (denoted as ZGNO-nanotube) was conducted by CO 2 photoreduction.", "context": "To synthesize the ZnGaNO nanotubes, a mixture of ZnO nanorods and Ga 2 O 3 nanoplates was employed as raw materials.The ZnO nanorods were first synthesized by water bath heating of Zn(CH 3 COO) 2 and ammonia, and the Ga 2 O 3 nanoplates were synthesized by a hydrothermal ion-exchange reaction of KGaO 2 and CH 3 COOH and followed by dehydroxylation treatment (see the Experiment section in the ESI ).Then, the mixture of ZnO nanorods and Ga 2 O 3 nanoplates was nitrided at 750 C for 5 h under 250 mL min -1 flowing NH 3 to obtain the ZnGaNO nanotubes.The phase compositions of the precursors and products were confirmed by the XRD patterns, as shown in Fig. 1a.We can see that both of the precursors, ZnO and Ga 2 O 3 , were well crystallized with no impurity phase.XRD peaks of the mixture of ZnO and Ga 2 O 3 after nitriding were located between those of ZnO and GaN, indicating that the nitriding product is a solid solution of ZnO and GaN, as demonstrated in previous reports. 28In addition, the UV-Vis absorption spectrum shown in Fig. 1b is further evidence of the formation of ZnGaNO solid solution.The band gap of the as-prepared ZnGaNO solid solution can be determined to be ca.2.58 eV, based on an absorption edge of ca.480 nm, which is lower than the band gap of either ZnO (3.2 eV) or GaN (3.4 eV), further confirming that the nitriding product ZnGaNO is a solid solution of GaN and ZnO.As a solid solution, the bandgap has been shown to depend strongly on the zinc or oxygen concentration due to the influence on structural and electronic properties. 29Energy dispersive X-ray spectrum (EDX) analysis showed that the Zn : Ga atom ratio of the as-prepared ZnGaNO solid solution was almost 1 : 2, which was in accordance with the band gap of 2.58 eV according to the empirical formula given by Muckerman's group. 29he morphologies of these as-prepared products were characterized by SEM and TEM, as shown in Fig. 2. It reveals that the precursors ZnO and Ga 2 O 3 are hexagonal singlecrystal nanorods (Fig. 2a) and diamond single-crystal nanoplates (Fig. 2b), respectively.The length of the ZnO nanorods is about 600-900 nm, and the diameter is about 200 nm.As shown in Fig. 2c andd, ZnGaNO nanotubes were well synthesized after nitriding the mixture of ZnO nanorods and Ga 2 O 3 nanoplates.The length of the nanotubes is about 600-900 nm, and the diameter is about 200 nm with about 40 nm thick walls.The cross-section image in Fig. 2d and TEM image in Fig. 2e are also evidence of the hollow structures of the derived ZnGaNO nanotubes.The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern is presented in Fig. 2f, which clearly demonstrates that the ZnGaNO nanotubes are single crystals. As can be seen from Fig. 2, the length and diameter of ZnGaNO nanotube and ZnO nanorod are almost the same.This indicates that the size and shape of the ZnGaNO nanotube could be retained from the precursor ZnO nanorod.In the reaction, atoms would diffuse across the contact interface at different diffusion rates, and defects may form and accumulate into the pores on the side with a higher diffusion rate.This indicated that the Kirkendall effect may occur.To synthesize porous materials via the Kirkendall effect, materials with high diffusion rates as templates are required.In our precursors, ZnO is a high-diffusion material, which has been applied in synthesizing binary and ternary hollow structures by the Kirkendall effect, as reported in the previous literature. 15,26,27It is also observed in our experiment that ZnO could be a suitable template to facilitate the formation of quaternary hollow nanotubes.Based on this knowledge, a growth process was proposed, as illustrated in Fig. 3. First, the Ga 2 O 3 nanoparticles and NH 3 react on the surface of a hexagonal ZnO nanorod.By mechanical mixing, rough contact interfaces were formed between the ZnO nanorods and Ga 2 O 3 nanoplates.Under high temperature calcination, atoms would diffuse across the contact interfaces, that is the N and Ga atoms would gradually migrate inward and the Zn and O atoms migrate outward.Nanoscale Ga 2 O 3 nanoplates would make a better contact interface and better interdiffusion.With the diffusion continuing, a ZnGaNO layer was formed on the surface of ZnO nanorod.At the same time, the outer layer Ga 2 O 3 would nitride into GaN.As ZnO and GaN have similar wurtzite structures, the wurtzite lattice may facilitate the interdiffusion as atoms would diffuse along the wurtzite structures.During the diffusion process, vacancies appear in the center of the ZnO nanorod and gradually accumulate into holes due to the high outward diffusion velocities of Zn and O atoms.With the diffusion process proceeding, the holes along the center of the ZnO nanorod become larger and larger, and finally form a nanotube with a skeleton of hexagonal ZnO nanorod.Though the skeletons of the precursors were usually in collapsed form at high temperatures, the skeletons of ZnO nanorods were perfectly preserved in the oxynitride product, which may be because of the high melting points of oxynitride. 30Under high temperature calcination, the oxynitride skeleton that has been formed would not melt, leading to the preservation of the hexagonal skeleton and formation of the final product ZnGaNO nanotubes. Furthermore, the sizes of the ZnGaNO nanotubes are controllable.As can be seen from the above results, the morphology of the ZnGaNO nanotube was mainly a copy of the profile of the hexagonal ZnO nanorods while with different sizes of the ZnO nanorod precursors, different sizes of the ZnGaNO nanotubes can be obtained.In Fig. 4a, we show the synthesis of larger sized ZnO rods by the hydrothermal method.With larger ZnO rods as templates, larger ZnGaNO tubes were obtained, as shown in Fig. 4b.Also, based on the knowledge of the proposed growing process, it is interesting to find that using the different shapes of the precursor ZnO will lead to different morphologies of ZnGaNO products.Indeed, ZnGaNO nanoflowers were successfully synthesized via the Kirkendall effect by using the ZnO nanoflowers as precursors, as illustrated in Fig. S2. This indicated that such a synthetic method can be widely applied to fabricate various shapes of ZnGaNO oxynitrides. The photocatalytic performance of the as-prepared ZnGaNO nanotubes (denoted as ZGNO-nanotube) was conducted by CO 2 photoreduction.Fig. 5a shows that CO 2 can be photoreduced into CH 4 over ZnGaNO nanotubes loaded with 0.5 wt Pt as a co-catalyst in the presence of water vapor under visible light irradiation (420 nm filter).For comparison, the photoreduction performances of ZnGaNO nanoparticles synthesized by the solid state reaction of ZnO and Ga 2 O 3 at 850 C under flowing NH 3 for 15 h (denoted as ZGNO-SSR), ZnGaNO nanorods synthesized by a molten salt ion-exchange method 31 and ZnGaNO tubes synthesized with ZnO rods were also examined. The CO 2 photoreduction experiment showed that methane evolution had a relatively good linear relationship with increased irradiation time.As calculated from the slope of the gas evolution curves, the production rate of methane was about 0.072 mol g -1 h -1 for ZGNO-nanotube, which was about 2 times higher than 0.033 mol g -1 h -1 for ZGNO-SSR.The ZGNO-nanorod has almost the same activity as the ZGNO-nanotube in the first four hours, and then gradually decreases.Under full-arc light irradiation (Fig. 5b), the CH 4 production rate over ZnGaNO nanotubes was about 0.60 mol g -1 h -1 , about 8 times higher than that under visible light irradiation, probably due to more light absorption and less bulk recombination because of the shorter penetration depth of ultraviolet light. The valance band maximum position of ZnGaNO solid solutions was determined by XPS (Fig. S5 ).As illustrated in Fig. 6, the maximum valance bands of ZGNO-SSR, ZGNO-tube, ZGNO-nanotube and ZGNO-nanorod are at 1.37 V, 1.24 V, 1.23 V and 1.27 V, respectively.The minimum conduction band position can be obtained by the formula: E g E VBM -E CBM , where E g is the band gap, E VBM is the valence band maximum and E CBM is the conduction band minimum.The band gaps of ZGNO-SSR, ZGNO-tube, ZGNO-nanotube and ZGNO-nanorod obtained from the UV-Vis absorption spectra are 2.61 eV, 2.50 eV, 2.58 eV and 2.54 eV, respectively (Fig. S4 ).Thus, the minimum conduction band position of ZGNO-SSR, ZGNO-tube, ZGNO-nanotube and ZGNO-nanorod are at -1.24 V, -1.26 V, -1.28 V and -1.27 V respectively, as shown in Fig. 6.The conduction bands for these samples used in this study are higher than -0.24 V, and the valance band is lower than 0.82 V, indicating that the band structure of ZnGaNO solid solution is able to oxidize water and reduce CO 2 into CH 4 .One possible reason for the improvement of the CO 2 photocatalytic reduction performance of ZnGaNO was the increased specific surface area.The nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurement indicated that the specific surface area of the ZGNO-nanotube was 12.1 m 2 g -1 , almost twice as much as 5.9 m 2 g -1 for ZGNO-SSR, and higher than 9.7 m 2 g -1 for ZGNO-tube.Larger surface area would provide more active sites and adsorption areas, leading to a higher photoreduction activity.It is worth pointing out that the ZnGaNO nanorods with larger specific surface area of 18.7 m 2 g -1 exhibited the same activity as ZnGaNO nanotubes (12.1 m 2 g -1 ), probably due to the nanotubes having increasing light utility by scattering and shortening the carriers diffusion distance in the tube wall.After 4 h light irradiation (Fig. 5a), the activity of ZnGaNO nanorods decreased.The decrease in activity probably originated from the photocorrosion due to the long carriers diffusion distance from the inner to the surface of nanorods. In addition, the crystal structure could be another reason for the improvement of the photocatalytic performance.It was reported that materials with wurtzite structure such as ZnO and GaN would have spontaneous polarization along the c-axis. 32,33In our case, as a solid solution of ZnO and GaN, ZnGaNO nanotubes, which were a single crystal with a preponderant growth along the c-axis, share the same wurtzite structure, meaning that ZnGaNO also has a spontaneous polarization effect and forms a uniform polarized electric field in the single crystal.Under the polarized electric field, electrons and holes would transfer in the opposite direction, thus can be effectively separated, leading to less recombination.Additionally, electron and hole transportation paths would form separately in the direction perpendicular to the c-axis, decreasing the recombination probability.In addition, the thin shell of the ZnGaNO nanotubes made the photo-generated carriers easier to transport to the surfaces instead of recombination.To compare the carrier recombination of those samples, photoluminescence (PL) analysis was conducted.The photoluminescence spectrum in Fig. 7 demonstrates that the ZGNO-SSR has a high photoluminescence peak at 640 nm, which can be attributed to the strong recombination of photogenerated carriers at the crystal defects formed during the high-temperature calcination. 3435536 In comparison, ZGNO-tube, ZGNO-nanotube and ZGNO-nanorod showed quite weak photoluminescence intensities, indicating that those samples had less radiative recombination of photogenerated carriers, leading to higher photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance."}, {"llm generation": "ZnGaNO nanotubes", "source": "The enhanced photocatalytic performance in CO 2 reduction was achieved over the as-prepared ZnGaNO nanotubes due to their higher specific surface area and less recombination of photogenerated carriers.", "context": "In summary, we demonstrated that the quaternary oxynitride ZnGaNO nanotubes can be successfully fabricated by the Kirkendall effect.The enhanced photocatalytic performance in CO 2 reduction was achieved over the as-prepared ZnGaNO nanotubes due to their higher specific surface area and less recombination of photogenerated carriers.The new synthetic strategy may provide a new guidance for the design and preparation of efficient nano-scaled oxynitride photocatalysts.

As can be seen from Fig. 2, the length and diameter of ZnGaNO nanotube and ZnO nanorod are almost the same.This indicates that the size and shape of the ZnGaNO nanotube could be retained from the precursor ZnO nanorod.In the reaction, atoms would diffuse across the contact interface at different diffusion rates, and defects may form and accumulate into the pores on the side with a higher diffusion rate.This indicated that the Kirkendall effect may occur.To synthesize porous materials via the Kirkendall effect, materials with high diffusion rates as templates are required.In our precursors, ZnO is a high-diffusion material, which has been applied in synthesizing binary and ternary hollow structures by the Kirkendall effect, as reported in the previous literature. 15,26,27It is also observed in our experiment that ZnO could be a suitable template to facilitate the formation of quaternary hollow nanotubes.Based on this knowledge, a growth process was proposed, as illustrated in Fig. 3. First, the Ga 2 O 3 nanoparticles and NH 3 react on the surface of a hexagonal ZnO nanorod.By mechanical mixing, rough contact interfaces were formed between the ZnO nanorods and Ga 2 O 3 nanoplates.Under high temperature calcination, atoms would diffuse across the contact interfaces, that is the N and Ga atoms would gradually migrate inward and the Zn and O atoms migrate outward.Nanoscale Ga 2 O 3 nanoplates would make a better contact interface and better interdiffusion.With the diffusion continuing, a ZnGaNO layer was formed on the surface of ZnO nanorod.At the same time, the outer layer Ga 2 O 3 would nitride into GaN.As ZnO and GaN have similar wurtzite structures, the wurtzite lattice may facilitate the interdiffusion as atoms would diffuse along the wurtzite structures.During the diffusion process, vacancies appear in the center of the ZnO nanorod and gradually accumulate into holes due to the high outward diffusion velocities of Zn and O atoms.With the diffusion process proceeding, the holes along the center of the ZnO nanorod become larger and larger, and finally form a nanotube with a skeleton of hexagonal ZnO nanorod.Though the skeletons of the precursors were usually in collapsed form at high temperatures, the skeletons of ZnO nanorods were perfectly preserved in the oxynitride product, which may be because of the high melting points of oxynitride. 30Under high temperature calcination, the oxynitride skeleton that has been formed would not melt, leading to the preservation of the hexagonal skeleton and formation of the final product ZnGaNO nanotubes. Furthermore, the sizes of the ZnGaNO nanotubes are controllable.As can be seen from the above results, the morphology of the ZnGaNO nanotube was mainly a copy of the profile of the hexagonal ZnO nanorods while with different sizes of the ZnO nanorod precursors, different sizes of the ZnGaNO nanotubes can be obtained.In Fig. 4a, we show the synthesis of larger sized ZnO rods by the hydrothermal method.With larger ZnO rods as templates, larger ZnGaNO tubes were obtained, as shown in Fig. 4b.Also, based on the knowledge of the proposed growing process, it is interesting to find that using the different shapes of the precursor ZnO will lead to different morphologies of ZnGaNO products.Indeed, ZnGaNO nanoflowers were successfully synthesized via the Kirkendall effect by using the ZnO nanoflowers as precursors, as illustrated in Fig. S2. This indicated that such a synthetic method can be widely applied to fabricate various shapes of ZnGaNO oxynitrides. The photocatalytic performance of the as-prepared ZnGaNO nanotubes (denoted as ZGNO-nanotube) was conducted by CO 2 photoreduction.Fig. 5a shows that CO 2 can be photoreduced into CH 4 over ZnGaNO nanotubes loaded with 0.5 wt Pt as a co-catalyst in the presence of water vapor under visible light irradiation (420 nm filter).For comparison, the photoreduction performances of ZnGaNO nanoparticles synthesized by the solid state reaction of ZnO and Ga 2 O 3 at 850 C under flowing NH 3 for 15 h (denoted as ZGNO-SSR), ZnGaNO nanorods synthesized by a molten salt ion-exchange method 31 and ZnGaNO tubes synthesized with ZnO rods were also examined. The CO 2 photoreduction experiment showed that methane evolution had a relatively good linear relationship with increased irradiation time.As calculated from the slope of the gas evolution curves, the production rate of methane was about 0.072 mol g -1 h -1 for ZGNO-nanotube, which was about 2 times higher than 0.033 mol g -1 h -1 for ZGNO-SSR.The ZGNO-nanorod has almost the same activity as the ZGNO-nanotube in the first four hours, and then gradually decreases.Under full-arc light irradiation (Fig. 5b), the CH 4 production rate over ZnGaNO nanotubes was about 0.60 mol g -1 h -1 , about 8 times higher than that under visible light irradiation, probably due to more light absorption and less bulk recombination because of the shorter penetration depth of ultraviolet light. The valance band maximum position of ZnGaNO solid solutions was determined by XPS (Fig. S5 ).As illustrated in Fig. 6, the maximum valance bands of ZGNO-SSR, ZGNO-tube, ZGNO-nanotube and ZGNO-nanorod are at 1.37 V, 1.24 V, 1.23 V and 1.27 V, respectively.The minimum conduction band position can be obtained by the formula: E g E VBM -E CBM , where E g is the band gap, E VBM is the valence band maximum and E CBM is the conduction band minimum.The band gaps of ZGNO-SSR, ZGNO-tube, ZGNO-nanotube and ZGNO-nanorod obtained from the UV-Vis absorption spectra are 2.61 eV, 2.50 eV, 2.58 eV and 2.54 eV, respectively (Fig. S4 ).Thus, the minimum conduction band position of ZGNO-SSR, ZGNO-tube, ZGNO-nanotube and ZGNO-nanorod are at -1.24 V, -1.26 V, -1.28 V and -1.27 V respectively, as shown in Fig. 6.The conduction bands for these samples used in this study are higher than -0.24 V, and the valance band is lower than 0.82 V, indicating that the band structure of ZnGaNO solid solution is able to oxidize water and reduce CO 2 into CH 4 .One possible reason for the improvement of the CO 2 photocatalytic reduction performance of ZnGaNO was the increased specific surface area.The nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurement indicated that the specific surface area of the ZGNO-nanotube was 12.1 m 2 g -1 , almost twice as much as 5.9 m 2 g -1 for ZGNO-SSR, and higher than 9.7 m 2 g -1 for ZGNO-tube.Larger surface area would provide more active sites and adsorption areas, leading to a higher photoreduction activity.It is worth pointing out that the ZnGaNO nanorods with larger specific surface area of 18.7 m 2 g -1 exhibited the same activity as ZnGaNO nanotubes (12.1 m 2 g -1 ), probably due to the nanotubes having increasing light utility by scattering and shortening the carriers diffusion distance in the tube wall.After 4 h light irradiation (Fig. 5a), the activity of ZnGaNO nanorods decreased.The decrease in activity probably originated from the photocorrosion due to the long carriers diffusion distance from the inner to the surface of nanorods. In addition, the crystal structure could be another reason for the improvement of the photocatalytic performance.It was reported that materials with wurtzite structure such as ZnO and GaN would have spontaneous polarization along the c-axis. 32,33In our case, as a solid solution of ZnO and GaN, ZnGaNO nanotubes, which were a single crystal with a preponderant growth along the c-axis, share the same wurtzite structure, meaning that ZnGaNO also has a spontaneous polarization effect and forms a uniform polarized electric field in the single crystal.Under the polarized electric field, electrons and holes would transfer in the opposite direction, thus can be effectively separated, leading to less recombination.Additionally, electron and hole transportation paths would form separately in the direction perpendicular to the c-axis, decreasing the recombination probability.In addition, the thin shell of the ZnGaNO nanotubes made the photo-generated carriers easier to transport to the surfaces instead of recombination.To compare the carrier recombination of those samples, photoluminescence (PL) analysis was conducted.The photoluminescence spectrum in Fig. 7 demonstrates that the ZGNO-SSR has a high photoluminescence peak at 640 nm, which can be attributed to the strong recombination of photogenerated carriers at the crystal defects formed during the high-temperature calcination. 3435536 In comparison, ZGNO-tube, ZGNO-nanotube and ZGNO-nanorod showed quite weak photoluminescence intensities, indicating that those samples had less radiative recombination of photogenerated carriers, leading to higher photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance."}], "light source": [{"llm generation": "xenon arc lamp", "source": "The light source was a 300 W xenon arc lamp from PerfectLight Company, and to obtain visible irradiation, a 420 nm filter was employed.", "context": "A ZnO nanorod was synthesized using Zn(NO 3 ) 2 6H 2 O and ammonium hydroxide as precursors.Typically, 2.5 g Zn(NO 3 ) 2 6H 2 O and 1.0 g ammonium hydroxide were added into 100 ml deionized water, and kept in a water bath at 90 C for 4 h.

The photocatalytic CO 2 reaction was carried out in a glass reactor with an area of 4.2 cm 2 .The light source was a 300 W xenon arc lamp from PerfectLight Company, and to obtain visible irradiation, a 420 nm filter was employed.The volume of the reaction chamber was about 230 ml.Before the reaction, the chamber was evacuated several times and then high purity CO 2 gas was introduced into the reaction chamber to achieve ambient pressure.0.4 ml deionized water was injected into the chamber as the reactant.During the reaction, 1 ml gas was extracted from the chamber by using a sampling needle at given intervals for subsequent CH 4 concentration analysis with gas chromatography (GC-2014, Shimadzu Corp., Japan)."}, {"llm generation": "Gas", "source": "Fig. 5a shows that CO 2 can be photoreduced into CH 4 over ZnGaNO nanotubes loaded with 0.5 wt Pt as a co-catalyst in the presence of water vapor under visible light irradiation (420 nm filter).", "context": "To synthesize the ZnGaNO nanotubes, a mixture of ZnO nanorods and Ga 2 O 3 nanoplates was employed as raw materials.The ZnO nanorods were first synthesized by water bath heating of Zn(CH 3 COO) 2 and ammonia, and the Ga 2 O 3 nanoplates were synthesized by a hydrothermal ion-exchange reaction of KGaO 2 and CH 3 COOH and followed by dehydroxylation treatment (see the Experiment section in the ESI ).Then, the mixture of ZnO nanorods and Ga 2 O 3 nanoplates was nitrided at 750 C for 5 h under 250 mL min -1 flowing NH 3 to obtain the ZnGaNO nanotubes.The phase compositions of the precursors and products were confirmed by the XRD patterns, as shown in Fig. 1a.We can see that both of the precursors, ZnO and Ga 2 O 3 , were well crystallized with no impurity phase.XRD peaks of the mixture of ZnO and Ga 2 O 3 after nitriding were located between those of ZnO and GaN, indicating that the nitriding product is a solid solution of ZnO and GaN, as demonstrated in previous reports. 28In addition, the UV-Vis absorption spectrum shown in Fig. 1b is further evidence of the formation of ZnGaNO solid solution.The band gap of the as-prepared ZnGaNO solid solution can be determined to be ca.2.58 eV, based on an absorption edge of ca.480 nm, which is lower than the band gap of either ZnO (3.2 eV) or GaN (3.4 eV), further confirming that the nitriding product ZnGaNO is a solid solution of GaN and ZnO.As a solid solution, the bandgap has been shown to depend strongly on the zinc or oxygen concentration due to the influence on structural and electronic properties. 29Energy dispersive X-ray spectrum (EDX) analysis showed that the Zn : Ga atom ratio of the as-prepared ZnGaNO solid solution was almost 1 : 2, which was in accordance with the band gap of 2.58 eV according to the empirical formula given by Muckerman's group. 29he morphologies of these as-prepared products were characterized by SEM and TEM, as shown in Fig. 2. It reveals that the precursors ZnO and Ga 2 O 3 are hexagonal singlecrystal nanorods (Fig. 2a) and diamond single-crystal nanoplates (Fig. 2b), respectively.The length of the ZnO nanorods is about 600-900 nm, and the diameter is about 200 nm.As shown in Fig. 2c andd, ZnGaNO nanotubes were well synthesized after nitriding the mixture of ZnO nanorods and Ga 2 O 3 nanoplates.The length of the nanotubes is about 600-900 nm, and the diameter is about 200 nm with about 40 nm thick walls.The cross-section image in Fig. 2d and TEM image in Fig. 2e are also evidence of the hollow structures of the derived ZnGaNO nanotubes.The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern is presented in Fig. 2f, which clearly demonstrates that the ZnGaNO nanotubes are single crystals. As can be seen from Fig. 2, the length and diameter of ZnGaNO nanotube and ZnO nanorod are almost the same.This indicates that the size and shape of the ZnGaNO nanotube could be retained from the precursor ZnO nanorod.In the reaction, atoms would diffuse across the contact interface at different diffusion rates, and defects may form and accumulate into the pores on the side with a higher diffusion rate.This indicated that the Kirkendall effect may occur.To synthesize porous materials via the Kirkendall effect, materials with high diffusion rates as templates are required.In our precursors, ZnO is a high-diffusion material, which has been applied in synthesizing binary and ternary hollow structures by the Kirkendall effect, as reported in the previous literature. 15,26,27It is also observed in our experiment that ZnO could be a suitable template to facilitate the formation of quaternary hollow nanotubes.Based on this knowledge, a growth process was proposed, as illustrated in Fig. 3. First, the Ga 2 O 3 nanoparticles and NH 3 react on the surface of a hexagonal ZnO nanorod.By mechanical mixing, rough contact interfaces were formed between the ZnO nanorods and Ga 2 O 3 nanoplates.Under high temperature calcination, atoms would diffuse across the contact interfaces, that is the N and Ga atoms would gradually migrate inward and the Zn and O atoms migrate outward.Nanoscale Ga 2 O 3 nanoplates would make a better contact interface and better interdiffusion.With the diffusion continuing, a ZnGaNO layer was formed on the surface of ZnO nanorod.At the same time, the outer layer Ga 2 O 3 would nitride into GaN.As ZnO and GaN have similar wurtzite structures, the wurtzite lattice may facilitate the interdiffusion as atoms would diffuse along the wurtzite structures.During the diffusion process, vacancies appear in the center of the ZnO nanorod and gradually accumulate into holes due to the high outward diffusion velocities of Zn and O atoms.With the diffusion process proceeding, the holes along the center of the ZnO nanorod become larger and larger, and finally form a nanotube with a skeleton of hexagonal ZnO nanorod.Though the skeletons of the precursors were usually in collapsed form at high temperatures, the skeletons of ZnO nanorods were perfectly preserved in the oxynitride product, which may be because of the high melting points of oxynitride. 30Under high temperature calcination, the oxynitride skeleton that has been formed would not melt, leading to the preservation of the hexagonal skeleton and formation of the final product ZnGaNO nanotubes. Furthermore, the sizes of the ZnGaNO nanotubes are controllable.As can be seen from the above results, the morphology of the ZnGaNO nanotube was mainly a copy of the profile of the hexagonal ZnO nanorods while with different sizes of the ZnO nanorod precursors, different sizes of the ZnGaNO nanotubes can be obtained.In Fig. 4a, we show the synthesis of larger sized ZnO rods by the hydrothermal method.With larger ZnO rods as templates, larger ZnGaNO tubes were obtained, as shown in Fig. 4b.Also, based on the knowledge of the proposed growing process, it is interesting to find that using the different shapes of the precursor ZnO will lead to different morphologies of ZnGaNO products.Indeed, ZnGaNO nanoflowers were successfully synthesized via the Kirkendall effect by using the ZnO nanoflowers as precursors, as illustrated in Fig. S2. This indicated that such a synthetic method can be widely applied to fabricate various shapes of ZnGaNO oxynitrides. The photocatalytic performance of the as-prepared ZnGaNO nanotubes (denoted as ZGNO-nanotube) was conducted by CO 2 photoreduction.Fig. 5a shows that CO 2 can be photoreduced into CH 4 over ZnGaNO nanotubes loaded with 0.5 wt Pt as a co-catalyst in the presence of water vapor under visible light irradiation (420 nm filter).For comparison, the photoreduction performances of ZnGaNO nanoparticles synthesized by the solid state reaction of ZnO and Ga 2 O 3 at 850 C under flowing NH 3 for 15 h (denoted as ZGNO-SSR), ZnGaNO nanorods synthesized by a molten salt ion-exchange method 31 and ZnGaNO tubes synthesized with ZnO rods were also examined. The CO 2 photoreduction experiment showed that methane evolution had a relatively good linear relationship with increased irradiation time.As calculated from the slope of the gas evolution curves, the production rate of methane was about 0.072 mol g -1 h -1 for ZGNO-nanotube, which was about 2 times higher than 0.033 mol g -1 h -1 for ZGNO-SSR.The ZGNO-nanorod has almost the same activity as the ZGNO-nanotube in the first four hours, and then gradually decreases.Under full-arc light irradiation (Fig. 5b), the CH 4 production rate over ZnGaNO nanotubes was about 0.60 mol g -1 h -1 , about 8 times higher than that under visible light irradiation, probably due to more light absorption and less bulk recombination because of the shorter penetration depth of ultraviolet light. The valance band maximum position of ZnGaNO solid solutions was determined by XPS (Fig. S5 ).As illustrated in Fig. 6, the maximum valance bands of ZGNO-SSR, ZGNO-tube, ZGNO-nanotube and ZGNO-nanorod are at 1.37 V, 1.24 V, 1.23 V and 1.27 V, respectively.The minimum conduction band position can be obtained by the formula: E g E VBM -E CBM , where E g is the band gap, E VBM is the valence band maximum and E CBM is the conduction band minimum.The band gaps of ZGNO-SSR, ZGNO-tube, ZGNO-nanotube and ZGNO-nanorod obtained from the UV-Vis absorption spectra are 2.61 eV, 2.50 eV, 2.58 eV and 2.54 eV, respectively (Fig. S4 ).Thus, the minimum conduction band position of ZGNO-SSR, ZGNO-tube, ZGNO-nanotube and ZGNO-nanorod are at -1.24 V, -1.26 V, -1.28 V and -1.27 V respectively, as shown in Fig. 6.The conduction bands for these samples used in this study are higher than -0.24 V, and the valance band is lower than 0.82 V, indicating that the band structure of ZnGaNO solid solution is able to oxidize water and reduce CO 2 into CH 4 .One possible reason for the improvement of the CO 2 photocatalytic reduction performance of ZnGaNO was the increased specific surface area.The nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurement indicated that the specific surface area of the ZGNO-nanotube was 12.1 m 2 g -1 , almost twice as much as 5.9 m 2 g -1 for ZGNO-SSR, and higher than 9.7 m 2 g -1 for ZGNO-tube.Larger surface area would provide more active sites and adsorption areas, leading to a higher photoreduction activity.It is worth pointing out that the ZnGaNO nanorods with larger specific surface area of 18.7 m 2 g -1 exhibited the same activity as ZnGaNO nanotubes (12.1 m 2 g -1 ), probably due to the nanotubes having increasing light utility by scattering and shortening the carriers diffusion distance in the tube wall.After 4 h light irradiation (Fig. 5a), the activity of ZnGaNO nanorods decreased.The decrease in activity probably originated from the photocorrosion due to the long carriers diffusion distance from the inner to the surface of nanorods. In addition, the crystal structure could be another reason for the improvement of the photocatalytic performance.It was reported that materials with wurtzite structure such as ZnO and GaN would have spontaneous polarization along the c-axis. 32,33In our case, as a solid solution of ZnO and GaN, ZnGaNO nanotubes, which were a single crystal with a preponderant growth along the c-axis, share the same wurtzite structure, meaning that ZnGaNO also has a spontaneous polarization effect and forms a uniform polarized electric field in the single crystal.Under the polarized electric field, electrons and holes would transfer in the opposite direction, thus can be effectively separated, leading to less recombination.Additionally, electron and hole transportation paths would form separately in the direction perpendicular to the c-axis, decreasing the recombination probability.In addition, the thin shell of the ZnGaNO nanotubes made the photo-generated carriers easier to transport to the surfaces instead of recombination.To compare the carrier recombination of those samples, photoluminescence (PL) analysis was conducted.The photoluminescence spectrum in Fig. 7 demonstrates that the ZGNO-SSR has a high photoluminescence peak at 640 nm, which can be attributed to the strong recombination of photogenerated carriers at the crystal defects formed during the high-temperature calcination. 3435536 In comparison, ZGNO-tube, ZGNO-nanotube and ZGNO-nanorod showed quite weak photoluminescence intensities, indicating that those samples had less radiative recombination of photogenerated carriers, leading to higher photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance."}], "reactor type": [], "operation mode": []}}
